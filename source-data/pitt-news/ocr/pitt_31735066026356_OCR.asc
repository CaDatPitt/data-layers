Bus contractor had natural-gas-powered bus
explode two years ago; PAT is buying 15

Jason Gatllnger

Staff Writer

Port Authority Transit has armotmced
plans to buy 160 new buses from a compa-
ny with an explosive safety record

PAT awarded the $52.5 million contract
to Neoplan USA Corp. Fifteen of the buses
will be powered by compressed natural gas.

On Aug. 21, 1996, a Neoplan-built bus
powered by CNG exploded in Los Angeles
during refueling. The blast ripped a hole in
theﬂoorofthebusandshatteredthewin-
dows. Nobody was injured, but maintenance
workers refused to fuel any more CNG-
powered buses.

PAT spokesperson Donna Aggazio said
she was not aware that Neoplan had experi-
enced problems of that nature.

However, she said the Port Authority
has “the highest conﬁdence” in Neoplan.

“Neoplan meets all of our safety
requirements and those that are federally

 
 

  

mandated,” she said “We consider Neoplan
to be one of the premier bus manufacturers.”

Aggazio said ﬁres and explosions
caused by CNG fuel are unusual occur-
rences. PAT has been operating ﬁve CNG-
powered buses, built by Orion Bus
Industries, since 1991 without incident

Furthermore, Aggazio said that PAT’s
CN G buses have their fuel tanks mounted on
theroof. Sincenatural gas islighterthanair,
a ﬁre would burn upward rather than into the
passenger cabin.

Jim Pekor, a spokesperson for Equitable
Gas, which has a contract to provide natural
gas to PAT, stressed the absolute safety of
CNG—powered buses.

“I can state uncategorically that the
CNG buses are the safest on their [PAT’s]
system,” he said

With the fuel tanks on the roof, Pekor
said, they are out of harrn’s way in any colli-
sion except in a roll over.

would bounce off the side of a tank

And, according to Pekor, the tanks are
subjected to a litany of durability tests.

“I’ve seen tests where they put the tanks
into a bonﬁre,” he said “I’ve also seen sticks

of dynamite strapped to a tank and ignited

 

Both times the tanks came out unharmed.”

Some buses, Pekor said, have their
CNG fuel tanks mounted underneath the
passenger compartment. Even those buses,
he said, are perfectly safe.

Mora Gottlieb brought a suitcase of sex toys to her workshop, ”KnowIedge is Power.”

CWO-sponsored speaker
toys wit female sexuality

Hal Turner
News Editor

Rachel McNary sat around last
Sunday with four other students and
played with sex toys.

Of course, McNary, co-presi-
dent of Campus Women’s
Organization, didn’t mean “use”
when she said she “played” with the
toys that lecturer Mara Gottlieb
pulled from her large suitcase.

She and the others just learned
about them in Gottlieb’s CWO-
sponsored workshop called
“Knowledge is Power.”

“It was just interesting to find
out the variety of things they have
just for women,” McNary said of
the devices Gottlieb brought to
show them.

To coincide‘ with Sexual Assault
Awareness month, the event was
meant to inform men and women of
women’s sexuality issues, focusing
on female masturbation. McNary
said that the workshop was open to
everyone, but it was CWO’s hope
that it could help students who are
uncomfortable with their sexuality
—— victims of sexual assault or
women with low sexual self-
esteem.

“When women know their bod-
ies, they’re able to be more confi-
dent and ask for exactly what they
want,” Gottlieb said. “Both in and
out of the bedroom.”

The hour—and—a-half long dis-
cussion opened when Gottlieb
described the toys and other things
she’d brought from the women’s
sexuality boutique where she
works. She passed around the toys
and talked about ﬂavored whipped
creams and oils.

McNary said Gottlieb answered
questions and explained to the
group of four women and one man
how everything is used.

When everyone had her or his
chance to play, all attention shifted
to women’s masturbation —— how to
do it and why it’s considered taboo.

“Guys talk about masturbation
all the time. There are slang terms,
e—mails of 101 names for male mas-
turbation,” Gottlieb explained. “But
what do we have for women? We
don’t have a lot of words.
Women don’t have a language to
talk about their bodies.”

The idea is that misconceptions
arise from rarely discussed, “social—
ly-inappropriate” topics.

“When something doesn’t get
talked about and there’s silence,
sometimes that silence can create
shame or discomfort,” Gottlieb
said.

But Gottlieb wasn’t uncomfort-
able talking about anything.

McNary said that when one stu-
dent asked about the G—spot, an
area on the roof of the vagina that
creates heightened sexual sensation
when touched, Gottlieb described to

“the group in detail everything she

knew about the spot.

“We want women to know it’s
OK to be sexual and there’s no
problem with that,” McNary said.
“This is something that needs to be
talked about, and if no one else is
going to do it, why should we?
We’re the CWO, and it’s impor-
tant.”

Gottlieb told the group that
when women understand them-
selves, they’re more confident and
in control.

Pharmacy professor dies; memori-
al service to be held

There will be a memorial service
for Stanford 1. Cohen, senior lecturer
of pharmacy administration at Pitt
who died of renal disease at the age
of 71 on March 2, at 1:30 p.m.
Monday, April 13, at Heinz
Memorial Chapel.

Cohen was a teacher, business-
man and pharmacist, and he served
on numerous boards of civic, acade-
mic and health-care institutions.
Also, he was a member of the Board
of Trustees of Pitt from 1974-75.
Cohen was also a past president of
the School’s Alumni Association and
a key volunteer who helped start the
University Annual Fund gift pro-
gram.

Cohen was a member of the
Army Air Corps during World War
II. After the war, he obtained degrees
in both education and pharmacy at
Pitt, graduating in 1957.

He taught at the Duquesne
University School of Pharmacy from
1968 to 1983, and at Pitt’s School of
Pharmacy from 1979 until his death.

A reception will follow the ser-
vice.

Reception and scholarship set to
honor self-help group founder

The Self Help Group Network,
Inc. will host a reception ’ on
Wednesday, May 20 from 5:30 to
7:30 p.m. in the Ballroom of the
William Pitt Union to celebrate 15
years of service to the self help
group movement and the Volunteer
efforts of executive director Betty
Hepner.

A scholarship will be established
through the Pitt School of Social
Work to honor the work of Hepner.

Algraduate of Pitt’s School of
Social Work, Hepner was the recipi-
ent of scholarship funds when she
attended the University. She said she
hopes the establishment of the funds
will highlight the work in the field of
self—help and encourage students to
pursue social work.

In 1983, Hepner founded the Self
Help Group Network, a hotline that
helps people with problems from
abuse to addiction and mental illness
by giving those people someone to
talk to.

The directory of self—help list-
ings has grown from 95 in 1983 to
600 presently.

Pitt chosen for Beckman Scholars

Sodexho + Marriott =
tewchanges for Pitt

Carrie Hager

Staff Writer

Sodexho, Pitt’s food service
contractor, i.s now the largest in the
world after its merger with Marriott
International, according to Betsy
Sallade-Farina, director of food ser-
vices.

But, she said, this doesn’t mean
much will be changing at the
University level.

“The people who are here will
continue to be here. The merger
won’t change the contract or the
food,” Sallade—Farina said.

Most major changes will be
made at the regional and corporate
level,.’but they will not effect
University personnel in any way.
Sal1ade—Farina said all the man-
agers, cooks, and other employees
will stay the same.

The merger’s inﬂuences to be
found at the University level‘ are

. results of Sodexho’s “best practices

rule,” according to Sallade-Farina.
The contractor plans to incorporate
the most positive aspects of
Marriott’s business into its own
agenda, but she did not elaborate on
what those aspects are.

“It is a wonderful thing for the
University to get to use resources

THE PITT NEWS

‘‘I think it will
just get better for
students. It is a
win.”

She added that
the way Sodexho
has grown is from
merging. She said

it only buys
strong, healthy
companies.

“As we move
forward, Sodexho-
Marriott Services
will be able to pro-
vide you with the
combination of the
best programs of
the two organiza-
tions,” said Michel
Landel, president
and CEO of
Sodexho
America.

According to Landel, Sodexho
will become the largest shareholder
following the merger with about 49
percent of the stock. The Marriott
family will own about 10 percent of
the stock, and the remainder will be
owned by the public.

The company will be called
Sodexho-Marriott Services for four
years and then will change over to
Sodexho.

North Sodexho employees Kathleen Chapman and Sheree Jennings will be unaffected by the merger.

Marriott owned the Pitt food
service contract last year, but lost
its contract to Sodexho, following
several complaints by students
about service and food quality.

Sallade-Farina said that some of
Marriott’s systems will remain in
place, such as its accounting system
and nutritional guides.

The reason for the. merger,
which Marriott’s board of directors

Tuesday, 7 April 1998

 
   

approved on March 27, stems from
the Marriott’s wish to focus of the
more V lucrative hotel industry,
Sallade-Farina said.

“Marriott wanted to raise capi-
tal quickly,” she added.

She added that this merger was
a perfect opportunity for Sodexho, a
worldwide organization based in
Paris, because it wanted a larger
presence in the United States.

er for a cause,” said Student
Government Board member
Jennifer Karch, who attended the
exhibit.

White symbolizes people
dealing with issues of coming
out to their family, friends or co-
workers. .

“Easter meant more to me
than chocolate bunnies and
Cadbury eggs,” one artist wrote
on her white triangle. “My mom
got a nice surprise in her basket
—— a gay daughter.”

Red triangles are for victims
of violence due to their sexual
preference. P

“You broke my nose and
gave me two black eyes but I
still took a woman to the prom,”
one red triangle read. “We had a
great time. What did you do that
night?”

One blue triangle stated, “In
the beginning we are all the
same. In the end it is our differ-
ences which make us beautiful
as a whole.” Blue triangles rep-
resent friends and family of gay,
lesbian, bisexual or transgen-

dered people.

Orange is for
those who are still
questioning their
sexuality or gen-
der. Green trian-
gles represent the
transgendered,
purple are for les-
bians, yellow are
set aside for
bisexuals, and
pink is for gays.

One artist,
Danielle Kurtz, a
Pitt parent and
lesbian, said she
came to see her
daughter’s trian-
gle. '

“She made a
triangle to support
me and my triangle,” Kurtz said.

Alyson Wallach, president of
the Student Government Board,
said she encourages students to
come out and see the exhibit.

“I want people to see how
open the gay, lesbian and bisex-
ual community at Pitt is,”
Wallach said. “Why shouldn’t
we accept it?” ‘

Rainbow Alliance President

Ray Murphy said this was a fan-
tastic opportunity for Pitt’s com-
munity to learn that homosexu-
als and bisexuals are individuals,
and shouldn’t be labeled simply
for their sexuality, but for their
personalities.

He added that the Rainbow
Alliance expects this event to be
celebrated nationally in the next
two years.

 

CWO

The workshop almost didn’t take place.
It filled the slot left by a cancelled Take
Back the Night event.

CWO made a March 19 emergency bud-
get modification request to pay Gottlieb
with money intended for the nixed event.
McNary said the lecture fit in well as a fol-
low-up to CWO’s Take Back the Night
march last Friday night.

The Allocations Committee unanimously
recommended the CWO get the money it
wanted, despite possible negative feedback
from the community on the event.

“The program conforms to the purpose
of the organization. We look for that in all
groups,” said Allocations Chair Chris
Boback. “There’s other things CWO does
that people question, like pro-choice
events.” a

The SGB approved the budget modifica-
tion, although not unanimously. Liz Klein
and Kelly Meyers opposed funding the lee-
ture, saying it was inappropriate to hold
such an event on campus, according to SGB
President Alyson Wallach.

“Women’s sexuality is an issue, and it
fits into CWO’s purpose better than any
other organization,” said Wallach. “And
SGB is the only way they could get the
money on such short notice.”

Pekor pointed out two incidents in New York
City where such buses were involved in side-impact
crashes. Neither bus exploded, he said

Following the 1996 explosion, Neoplan
installed liners to protect the fuel tanks from rocks
and debris. Neoplan spokeswoman Joyce Surprise
could not be reached for comment.

The new buses will arrive in the spring of 1999
and are part of PA'T’s ongoing effort to improve the
appearance and condition of its fleet

‘‘It is among our top priorities as we strive to
improve the delivery of transit services in Allegheny
County,” PAH‘ Executive Director Paul Skoutelas
said

Aggazio added that, with the new buses, the
average age of PAT’s ﬂeet of more than 900 buses
will be only‘ ﬁve years.

The federal government, which subsidizes the
purchase of mass transit buses, mandates that a bus
be used for 15 years or 500,000 miles. PAT will
replace all Neoplan buses already on its roster that
have met this requirement.

The new buses will be low-ﬂoor models, riding
only 15 inches oif the ground, and will have no steps
for passengers to climb up and down.

PAT‘ is hoping that elderly and disabled passen-
gers will have an easier time getting on and off the
new buses, Aggazio said

Thebuses will also havea“knee' g” feature-
where the front end can be lowered — in case some
passengers still have diﬁiculty stepping up the 10—or-
so inches form the curb.

To accommodate wheelchair-bound passen-
gers, the low-ﬂoor buses will have a ramp that can be
extended to the curb. The ramps are much simpler
mechanisms than the elaborate wheelchair lifts cur-
rently in use. Thus, the ramps will be easier to main-
tain and will be less likely to malfunction.

Each of the new buses will also have three sur-
veillance cameras, at a cost of $5,0()0 per bus. One
camera will be mounted over the driver’s window to
watch the fare station. Another camera will watch
over the length of the interior from above the wind-
shield The third camera will sit opposite the rear
doors.

Instead of video tape, the cameras will record
their images on a disc much like a compact disc. PAT

5

says the images recorded on these discs willbe sharp
enough to clearly make out the features of riders sit-
tingattheveryrearofthebus.

Aggazio dismissed the idea that the surveillance
cameras were intended to cut down a rampant van-
dalism problem

“Surveillance cameras are becoming state-of-
the-art on buses, and we want to keep up with the
mend,” she said

As well as keeping PM‘ at the forefront of mass
transit innovation, the cameras will help to deter rid-
ers from ﬁling false injury claims, Aggazio said. A
quick check of the camera record will tell if a pas-
senger is being honest.

Each bus will seat 37 passengers, will be air
conditioned and will have upholstered seats.

The $52.5 million price tag for the purchase
breaks down to $328,125 per bus. A combination of
federal. and state grants will foot the bill.

_ There is an additional cost of $55,000 for each
of the CNG-powered units.

Aggazio said PM is willing to pay the addition-
alcostperunitbecausenatural gas is somuch clean-
er than diesel fuel. CNG-powered buses emit less
ozone—dep1eting nitrous oxide. .

CNG-powered buses are maintained and fueled
at PAT ’s West Miﬂlin garage. As part of its partner-
ship in PAT ’s CNG program, Equitable Gas will
upgrade the facility to handle the 15 new CNG
buses.

Pekor said the upgrades will include a new gas
conditioning system, which removes water vapor; a
new ﬁltration system to remove particulate matter;
and a new dispenser.

The upgrades are necessary, Pekor said, because
the facility was designed to handle only the ﬁve
CNG-powered buses currently on PAT ’s roster.

Pekor said Equitable Gas will perform the work
at no charge to PAT because it will make enough
proﬁt by selling fuel for the new buses.

Equitable Gas trains PAT‘ maintenance employ-
ees to refuel the buses.

In recent months, PAT has armounced several
decisions to expand its ﬂeet. The Port Authority is in
the process of purchasing more than 70 24-passen-
ger buses to be used in suburban areas.

PAT has also ordered 40 60-foot articulated
buses —— buses that bend in the middle —— which will
also be built by Neoplan.

Local thief still looking for ”Cor

Brett Taylor
Assistant News Editor

Already awaiting trial on burglary charges,
the “Carl Burglar” struck again last week, landing
more charges and still unable to ﬁnd his friend
“Carl.”

Richard D. Scalise, 43, became known as the
“Carl Burglar” after victims caught him prowling
around or breaking into their homes. When con-
fronted, he acted confused and told them he was
looking for “Carl” and would promptly leave.

Scalise was back at it again, this time while
free on bond and awaiting an April 14 trial date
for charges that include 21 counts of burglary.
This time, he broke into an apartment in the 4600
block of Centre Avenue —— for the second time.

Sgt. Mark Ninehouser, from the Pittsburgh
Police department's burglary division, said the
victim recognized Scalise from a previous court
hearing and identiﬁed him to the police. Scalise

III

was identiﬁed separately by a female Pitt student
who found him climbing out a window of her
Morewood Avenue apartment.

Scalise received two additional burglary
charges and a criminal trespass charge from these
most recent break-ins and his subsequent arrest on
March 30.

Ninehouser said most of Scalise’s known vic-
tims are Pitt students, and a few are from CMU or
Duquesne.

He added that Scalise searched for apart-
ments with unlocked doors but generally found
the owners to be home when the door was
unlocked.

Scalise only stole money and jewelry, accord-
ing to Ninehouser, because he could put it in his
pocket.

Ninehouser said although Scalise is apparent-
ly sane, he does have a long history of arrests
including burglary, drug and trespassing Charges
dating back to 1971.

Vote YES for bus pass

For the ﬁrst time in recent memory — perhaps the
ﬁrst time ever — students have a chance to decide what_
direction Pitt will take in improving student life.

Pitt's Department of Parking and Transportation has
placed a survey online so that students can vote_ on a
proposal to turn our student IDs into full-ﬂedged bus
passes.

Unlike the current agreement with PATransit, the
proposal will allow students to travel anywhere PAT
buses run with their ID cards. No longer limited to just

Squirrel Hill and Shadyside (and Downtown if you add . «

50 cents and wait until after dark), Pitt students would
be free to roam the urban environment they chose Pitt
for in the first place.

We strongly urge students to take one minute to log

on to the Parking and Transportation Web page and vote
yes on the proposal.
V The expanded bus service will make it easier for
students to get around all of Allegheny County; it will
expand the effective range of off-campus housing; and
it could reduce the cost of living for many students,
making it more feasible for students to ﬁnd jobs and
internships outside the immediate vicinity.

A $30 per semester increase in the parking and
transportation fee would pay for itself for students who
took a bus round trip just once a week outside the
Squirrel Hill-Shadyside zone.

Commuters who use the PAT buses spend $30 each
month on bus passes ——- twice as much if they live just
two zones out. ' '

And whether they want to visit the Pittsburgh Zoo,
Three Rivers Stadium, Kennywood Park, North Park,
South Park, Station Square, the Aviary, Carnegie
Science Center, Ross Park Mall, Cent11ry III Mall,
Showcase Cinemas East, or Gus and Yaya's Old
Fashioned Ice Ball Stand on the North Side, they can do
so at any time of the year, day or evening, with just a stu-
dent ID for fare.

And don't forget free rides to the airport, too. No
more need to pay an arm and a leg for that ride, or for
airport parking, when you're already shelling out hun-
dreds for a plane ticket

The convenience of not having to hunt for change
or hope you have enough money to get home should
alone be worth the slightly increased fee.

Take a minute today to ﬁnd a computer, start up a
Web browser, and vote yes at:

Besides, if students don't show interest and vote,
they may never have a chance to make a difference like
this again.

We all need something to believe in

Michael Berquest

   

columnist

Recently I began reading a book
by historian Stephen Ambrose called
"Citizen Soldiers." It is the story of the
trials and tribulations of the soldiers

 a who fought in U.S. Army during

World War II on the beaches of
Normandy, across the ﬁelds of France
and into the very heart of Germany.
Ambrose's book is an interesting tale
of how ordinary men, virtually none
of whom had ever traveled away
from the small towns in which they
lived since birth, went to Europe and
defeated one of the largest and most
formidable ﬁghting forces that has
ever existed

As I read the book, I became
interested in how the soldiers who
fought seemed to feel that they were a
part of something bigger than them-

' selves, that the skirmishes they fought

everyday were part of a larger cause
worth ﬁghting, even worth dying for.
Ambrose noted in his book that
American soldiers "knew they were

. ﬁghting for decency and democracy

and they were proud of it and moti-
vated by it." The belief that they were
inEunope to performthe most serious
and important of tasks brought them
all together. "

I later found myself thinking:
Where have all of the causes gone?
From World War II to the Cold War,
to Civil Rights to the Space Program,

the United States has embarked on ‘

crusade after crusade during the last
half century in an effort to right the
wrongs of the world or to accomplish
a task that seems to be impossible.
Today there doesn't seem to be any-
thing worth ﬁghting for, no tasks or
causes worth devoting one's life
toward

In his 1961 inaugural address,

President John F. Kennedy gave
America a ringing call to public ser-
vicetlratremainstotlrisdayasoneof
the greatest speeches ever given.
Kennedy said, "Now the trumpet
surnmonsusagaimnotasacallto
beararms,thougharmsweneed;not
as a call to battle,~though in battle we
are;butasacalltobeartheburder1sof
a long, twilight struggle —— year in
and year out, rejoicing in hope,
patient in tribulation —— a struggle
against the common enemies of man
—— tyranny, poverty, disease, and war
itself."

President Kennedy's call to
action, his exhortation for Americans
toleavethedullandgrayyearsofthe
1950s behind and embrace promise
ofthefutureis stillrememberedby
babyboomers as one of the deﬁning
moments of their generation. It
prompted thousands upon thousands
toenlistinthePeaceCorps,togo
south to ﬁght for Civil Rights, and to
devote themselves to the task of
improving America through service
and sacriﬁce. The journey of self-real-
ization they embarked upon marked
their lives forever. For Bill Clinton,
President Kennedy's call to public
service led him to devote his entire
life to the political arena.

If President Clinton were to give
a speech in a similar spirit tomorrow
he'd likely be laughed at by today's
college students —— the very same
people who were so inspired by
Kennedy's words nearly 40 years ago.
People today seem moody and cyni-
cal, selﬁsh and quarrelsome. We live
in a day where ignorance and pes-
simism are the order of the day.
People who actually care about the

world around them are treated with '

scorn and contempt.
It's easy to see why. We live in a
darker age now, a time where we see

Woodrow Wilson categorized
America's involvement in World War
I as a crusade of "making the world
safe for democracy." What great caus-
es are we working toward today?
America's foreign policy seems whol-
ly oriented toward creating markets
for American goods abroad and bol-
stering our fading position as the
world's sole superpower. Though
effective (numerous jobs have been
created in the United States thanks to
these trade pacts), the fact is that
"making the world safe for Coca-
Cola" simply doesn't inspire the same
awe.

The warriors of "Citizen
Soldiers" embraced their cause
because they believed” it was worth
dying for. During the 1960s, the baby-
embraced President
Kennedy's call for action because
they saw a need to improve the lives
of those who weren't as fortunate as
they were. .

Is there something out there
worth believing in? Something worth
having faith in? I think so, but it
remains an open question whether the
college students of today will
embrace any cause or crusade. I hope
they do.

just don't care about anything any-

Hypnotism, roommates and stuffed animals just don '1‘ mix

Recently, I had the opportunity to wit-
ness young college kids getting hypnotized.
I didn’t believe that it could be done, but this
display made me a believer.

I then began to wonder, why shouldn’t

So, like any resourceful young boy would, I
found all the information on the Internet.
After practicing the technique on several

tried to hypnotize Roornie.

Me: OK, now this should work. Just breathe

' deeply a few times and 

Roomie: Rehan, this isn’t going to work.

And I have stuﬁ to do.

Me: No, just listen, take a deep breath, and
clear your mind of all aberrational thoughts.
Roomie: What, like smacking you across
the face with that life-sized Gumby? What
the devil is he doing here, anyway?

Me: Now, on the count of three, you will be
in a deep trance. One, two, three.

Roomie: It didn’t work And Gumby is con-
tinuing to ﬁeak me out. He’s seriously mess-
ing with my vibe.

Me: Alright, now each time you pick up the
phone, you will answer it, “Roomie here

Roomie: OK, that’s the most idiotic thing
I’ve ever heard Go away, I’ve got work.
Despite this incident, I didn’t feel too
discouraged. I decided to try my newly
found science on the streets. Leaving my

on any college campus: loitering
smokers. I went up to one who
just lit up and explained to him
what I wanted to do. Since he
didn’t respond, I jumped right
into the routine, which had gone
through some changes on the
way outside:

inside without a word

Fine, I thought.

I continued on my little adventure for
hypnotic happiness. Things were not look-

up posters on Forbes, so I attempted to
board him on my bus of hypnotisrn. I
explained to him what I hoped to accom-
plish and he mumbled something about
‘Los Piskaros,’ some band that was doing a
few shows. I thought it best to humor him
and just begin the routine. I'didn’t realize
how musically inclined this chap was.

At this point, people were staring at us
and he proceeded to attach a poster to my
chest. This wouldn’t have been such a bad
thing if he had taped it on. But he chose sta-
ples. And I suppose that it wasn’t so much a
physical as an emotional pain. I felt like cry-

approach would work Maybe I should get
back to basics. I soon found such an outlet.
A little squirrel had stopped in ﬁ'ont of
me. I began talking to it, suggesting various
little tasls. I asked it to spin around in circles
and jump up and down. The little beast did-
n’t do either of these. Instead, it began col-
lecting various nuts — walnuts, hazelnuts
and acorns. Then, Rocky began shoving the
acorns into my mouth and ears. I thought
this behavior a bit strange. It wasn’t so much

“ its actions but the fact that I couldn’t ﬁgure

out where the little bugger had found all
those damn nuts this time of the year.

The whole business with the squirrel
made me hungry. I decided to call Roornie
about lunch.

“Hello?”

“Roomie here and happy to help —

to print this column; we still haven't ﬁgured

When El Nino decided to
tamper with the already tempera-
mental Pittsburgh weather, it must
have tampered with Pitt students‘
maturity levels, too. Either that, or
there's an inverse relationship
between temperature and brain
function. When the mercury in the
thermometer rises, it seems as if
we must be reverting back to our
childhoods.

After stepping of the
Sutherland Express shuttle in front
of the Cathedral of Learning a few
days ago, I did a double take. Since
it was early evening, and the sun
was no longer at peak tanning
position, I guess, students had
vacated their spots on the
Cathedral lawn. However, they
must have wanted to save their
places or something, because there
was garbage all over the grass,
exactly where students had been
sunning and soaking up the rays
just a few hours earlier.

I couldn't believe the nerve of

those people and commented as

But, gazing at the lawn and other
various spots around campus that
are good-weather hangouts, it
doesn't seem to have worked too
well. The garbage cans were either

was in them

realize that it involves effort,

once the high temperature hits 70,
but I don't think it would have any
long-terrn adverse effects on their

deposit your garbage into the

maybe, we won't have to deal with

wouldn't have to deal with it at all.
Pitt maintenance workers are not

don't need more to deal with.

Maris’ number
is finally up

“He hits the ball like no other
human being.”

While that saying may seem
like little more than hyperbole,
Padres manager Bruce Bochy’s
assessment of Mark McGwire is
surprisingly accurate.

The Cardinals slugger has been
the talk of baseball during the first
week of play. He hit home runs in
his first four games, including a
500—foot grand slam in the Cards’
opener against the Dodgers, and has
12 RBI after just five games.

This is just .the beginning of a
season that will see McGwire hit
more home runs than anyone else.
McGwire will be the first player to
notch 65 home runs in a season,
breaking Roger Maris’ record 61
homers in 1961.

There are several signs that
point toward McGwire breaking the
record. The first is his track record.

In the last two seasons, Big Mac
has hit 110 home runs, including
last year’s league-leading 58
dingers. His total last season is par-
ticularly remarkable because his
season was split between the
Oakland Athletics and the
Cardinals.

Most players have a certain
amount of adjustment period when
they switch leagues, taking time to
survey new pitchers and parks’
dimensions. But McGwire’s homer
pace actually accelerated after he
moved from Oak1and’s hitter-
friendly Alameda County Stadium
to the pitcher-friendly Busch
Stadium.

Last year in Oakland, McGwire
hit 34 home runs in 366 at bats, or
one dinger for every 10.7 at bats.
When McGwire was traded after
the All-Star break, he hit 24 long-
balls in half the at bats (174), or a
home run for every 7.25 at bats.

McGwire obviously likes
National League pitching.

The second clue hinting that
McGwire will break Maris’ record
is that he plays for a winning team.
Maris’ 1961 team won the World
Series. The 1998 Cardinals may or
may not be a World Series team, but
they are a solid team, one with
good hitting and above-average
pitching.

What this means for McGwire
is that with a good team around

Pete Gonzalez hasn’t stopped winning
yet.

Last night in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room, the All-Big East quar-
terback took home some more hardware,
one of three recipients of the school’s
Panther Award, given to top Pitt senior
athletes.

He was joined by track star Joetta
Purter and wrestler Mark Bodo, who
added the plaque to a trophy case already
filled with three A1l—America awards, one
only a few weeks old.

“This is the exclamation point on my
career here at Pitt,” Gonzalez said after
the ceremony, surrounded by family
members. “To not play for four years and
then to achieve all I did this year is
unfathomable.”

Bodo’s teammate, John Withrow,
received the Blue-Gold Award at the cere-
mony, sharing the honor with women’s
swim team member Erin Bissell. While
the Panther Award winners were honored
for their on-field performance, the Blue-

Giant swings around the top bar,
a perfect handstand and a third-

Samantha Salyers’ uneven parallel
bars routine. She received a score
of 9.775 compared to her 9.875
mark of a year ago, which qualified
her for the 1997 nationals.

Calli Bodnar had a good perfor-

passes and clapping that was in
sync with the music. Her teammates
were cheering her every step of the

A perfectly straight handstand

Penn State finished with ﬂoor exer-
cise routines while Ohio State com-
pleted the vault.

Penn State gymnasts used popu-
lar rock music selections by Rusted
Root and others to get the crowd
involved in their routines. Missy
Leopoldus had a near ﬂawless rou-
tine scoring a 9.85 for the Lions.
Every Penn State routine started off
with the “roar” of the Nittany Lion.

Ohio State scored progressively
higher scores on the vault. Lindsey
Vagedes helped give the Buckeyes
some hope with a perfect landing
and a score of 9.875 on her vault.

When the performances were
over, each team lined up and
marched onto the floor in their
seeded order for the awards presen-
tation.

Athletics Director Steve
Pederson presented the awards.
First came the announcement of the
Coach and Assistant Coach of the
Year awards as voted on by col-
leagues in the Northeast Regional
section. Honors went to Penn
State’s Head Coach Steve Shephard
and his assistant, Jessica Bastardi.

The University of
Pennsylvania’s Kathleen Gunn was
awarded Gymnast of the Year for
the Northeast region. She was an

the meet.

Staff Writer

The second base position was a
question mark for the Panther base-
ball team when this season began in

Florida. There were many players.

who could play the position. But
coming into the 1998 campaign,
Head Coach Joe Jordano was still
contemplating who would start at
second.

One definite possibility was the
speedy, hard-hitting Harry
Ciavarella, who was originally
recruited as a shortstop. But could
he make the transition to second?

Ciavarella quickly made himself
known by scoring three runs and
drilling an RBI double against
Eastern Michigan in Pitt’s second
game of the season.

“Our original plan was to start
him at second right from the start,”
said Jordano.

Ciavarella attended North
Pocono High School, located in the
northeastern region of the state. At
North Pocono, he was the team’s
Most Valuable Player his'junior and
senior year. He also won the
Lackawanna County Batting Title in
his senior year.

Ciavarella made the transition
from shortstop to second with ease,
especially playing along side short-
stop Lou Melucci, who played in the
same league as Ciavarella during his
high school years.

After he was redshirted his
freshman year, Ciavarella saw little
playing time as a sophomore, riding
the pine behind older players. He
was given a key opportunity against

a tough St. John’s team last April

_ during his sophomore year. With the

team down, former Head Coach
Mark Jackson replaced all of his
starters with back up players.
Ciavarella took advantage of the
opportunity and blasted a home run
for a comeback attempt that fell just
short.‘

Coming into this season with a
new coaching staff and a younger
squad, there were new expectations
for the young infielder.

“I feel everyone is getting a bet-
ter chance this year. There is also a
more realistic coaching philosophy
than under Coach Jackson,” said
Ciavarella.

Early in the season, Ciavarella
struggled at the plate but dominated
in the field. Going into the end of
March, he assisted a team-high eight
double plays. His 47 put-out assists
ranks second on the team. ,

It was only a matter of time
before Ciavarella’s bat became hot.
In a March 31 contest against
Duquesne, Ciavarella had four hits
in as many at bats en route to a 15-6
Panther victory. According to
Ciavarella, it was a game that he was
able to break open to help him end
his slump.

Ever since the Duquesne game,
Ciavarella has raised his batting

average to .222 with 14 runs scored-

on the season. He has 12 hits, five of
which are doubles, and is tied for the
team lead with two triples. He ranks
second on the team with 13 RBI, and
his 21 total bases ranks him third.
“I’m very impressed with his
work ethic,” said Jordano. “He has

The Pitt rugby team started its sea-
son 3-1 and seemed to be having a
great year when disaster struck. The
team ended the season losing five
straight including the alumni game to
give it a losing record for the spring
campaign.

The team’s battle cry from the

beginning of the year was to learn from
the fall, work harder and try to make a
run. at the end of this spring season.
These goals looked very promising at
the beginning of the season with wins
over Grove City, Carnegie Mellon and
the University of Central Florida.

The Panthers then lost to the
Westmoreland County men’s club
before going into the most important
part of their season.

First, they traveled to Virginia to
take on Mary Washington College.
Rugby team captain Dave Misiolek
called this game a tune up for the Pitt
City Tournament.

The game did not quite go as the
team had hoped, and it lost, 25-7.

“It was not a pretty game,” said
Misiolek. Mary Washington kicked a
great deal, a style of play the Panthers
had never experienced before.

Misiolek called the trip “a lost
weekend,” citing the game and poor
weather conditions. \

After poor performance in Virginia,
the Panthers met SUNY Oswego in the
ﬁrst round of the Pitt City Tournament.

The Lakers came ready to play for
the 9 a.m. game and dominated the
Panthers from the opening whistle.

“We just came in really, really
ﬂat,” said Misiolek. “We never ended
up playing well.”

Pitt played fundamentally well,
according to Head,Coach Dan Talbert,
but it just could not conquer the Lakers,
who went on to win, 22-12. _

“We sat back on our heels and let
them bring it to us,” Talbert said of his

team.

In the second game of the day, Pitt
took on cross-state rivals Penn State,
and the Nittany Lions proved to be far
superior to the Panthers, waltzing to a
45-0 win.

Penn State is currently ranked No.
2 in the country and played like it, tak-
ing a 31-0 lead in the ﬁrst half.

“Penn State is Penn State,” Talbert
said after the game. “This was a learn-
ing experience for our young team.”

Penn State is a veteran team, and
this showed in the ﬁrst half. The Lions
had the wind at their backs and made
the most of it as they jumped out to the
early lead.

Pitt had the wind on its side in the
second half, but was not able to use it
as well due to lack of experience.

In the last game of the day, Pitt
faced California State. The Panthers
were beaten and battered after their
ﬁrst two games of the day and lost this
game, 20-15.

“This wasn’t the same team as at

the beginning of the year,” Talbert said‘

citing his team’s lack of drive and com-
mitment. ~

Talbert did not cite one group on
his team as the culprits but blamed
everyone for their play.

Pitt’s ﬁnal game came last week-
end against alumni of the rugby team.
The current team lost 20-0 to the veter-
ans, but all the scoring came in the sec-
ond half.

“This game is a lot of fun and we
look forward to it every year,” Misiolek
said.

The alumni had a decided advan-
tage with all of their experience, and
since Talbert played for them, he could
exploit the weakness of the current
team.

The Panthers have ended their
spring schedule and now begin prepar-
ing for their fall league schedule. They
will need a lot of young players to step
into the voids left by graduating seniors
in order to be successful next year. -

listened to what we have been
telling him and teaching him all sea-
son.”

Ciavarella stresses that even

‘i though the team is going through

some rough games right now, they
are still very young.

“We have a lot of potential. We
are. just trying to focus on the funda-
mentals. We’re still working hard
and keeping focused,” said
Ciavarella.

in

He also stressed that the three-
game set against Notre Dame at
Three Rivers Stadium will be an
important series. “I think if we keep
working hard, then those games will
be very close. Hopefully there will
be more fan support at those games
too,” said Ciavarella.

Notre Dame visits Pittsburgh on
Saturday, April 18 for a double
header starting at 5 p.m., and
Sunday, April 19 starting at 5 p.m. as
well. Both games will start immedi-
ately following the conclusion of the
Pirates’ games.

a losing team, and he stuck

power hitter the

In St. Louis, McGwire
has speedy second baseman
Delino DeShields and power
hitting outfielders Ron Gant,
Ray Lankford and Brian
Jordan batting around him. .

The hitters in front of
him will get on base enough
to give McGwire something
to shoot for; the hitters
behind him are strong
enough that pitchers can’t
intentionally walk McGwire
without paying dearly for
doing so.

The third reason
McGwire will break Maris’
record is pressure.

He has faced it before,

McGwire’s laid—back
demeanor shows that he also
has the personality to with-
stand the pressure that goes
along with breaking one of
baseball’s longstanding
records.

“You just don’t see too
many guys in this league do
the things he does,” San
Diego’s Tony Gwynn said.
“If you look at his numbers,
it’s hard to argue that he’s
not the best power hitter in
the game.”

That wasn’t some starry-
eyed rookie beaming about
McGwire. That was Tony
Gwynn, arguably baseball’s
best hitter.

McGwire’s power capabili-
