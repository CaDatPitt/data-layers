Parking RestrictedOn Oakland Streets

By Tool) NERKEL

Commuters scouring the Oakland
area for a free parking space would
be wise to avoid certain streets which
have become part of a sticker park-
ing program. On these streets, only
cars with a permit sticker issued by
the city are allowed to park for more
than an hour.

The idea of permit parking, or
reserved spaces for residents on pub-
lic streets, is not a new one. Other
urban centers, such as the area sur-
rounding Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., have attempted
to alleviate parking. congestion with
similar measures but questions over
the program’s legality continue.

“One of the hold-ups here in Pitts-
burgh is that there have been differ-
ing interpretations by the courts in
other states as to the legality of re-

s

stricting parking on public streets,”
Ray Reaves, assistant director of the
City Planning Office, said.

Last year, Pittsburgh City Coun-

cil passed legislation allowing such ‘
restrictions. The first permit parking

program began in the area sur-
rounding St. Francis Hospital in the

~ Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh.

“We had always hoped the first
gpermit parking] would be in Oak-
and,” Sandra Phillips, president of
Oakland Planning and Develop-
ment, said. “Finally, now, we have
begun the first phase of the sticker
parking program for Oakland.

“Over the years we have con-,
~ tinued to study those programs in

other cities and as far as I know, all

’ of -them have been great successes,”

Phillips said. “We have worked hard
to get these kinds of programs
implemented in the city."

Any community group wishing to
organize such a ‘program must fol-
low a procedure set up by the City
Planning Office. The city ordinance
regulating permit parking requires
that petitions signed by residents
from 75 percentof the street’s units
be obtained. The planning commi-
sion then conducts a public hearing
on the matter after which City
Council must approve the program
before it can go into effect.

The organizers of the Oakland
project all agree that the Lawrence-
ville pilot has been a success.

“We’ve had a pretty. good success
out there [in Lawrenceville]," Leo-
nard Prosser of_ the ‘city’s Parking
Enforcement Office said, “but" it
took time, just like this program will

take time." . *

That first “phase of. the Oakland
program requires“ that any vehicle

Ron and Pat Garda of Swiss-
vale are looking for volunteers to
help their nine-year-old daughter
Jodi through a rehabilitation
program, called ‘Patterning and
Programming," for patients with
permanent brain damage.

Jodi‘s mother, Pat, describes
“Patterning and Programming”
as a “program to reteach” J odi’s
brain.

Five people are needed to
assist Jodi through one full pro-

. gram, which is done twice daily.

Reteaching The Brain, Regaining The Child

Jodi goes through a series of
exercises, leg and arm unlocks,
which Mrs. Garda said are like
“warm-ups”, feet exercises, and
some lifting.

The “patterning" itself lasts for _

only five minutes of the two-hour
period. Jodi is placed on a table,
and the volunteers, ‘one at her
head and one on each arm and
leg, coordinate movements of
her body.
She is on a second pattern,
said Mrs. Garda, called “cross
patterning”. The volunteer at her

head moves her head one way,
say left, while at the same time
another volunteer raises her left
arm and another raises her right
leg. The process is then repeated
the opposite way. .

Jodi has been on the pattern-
ing program for a little over a
year. The Gardas learned about
patterning through the Spitz
Clinic in Morton, Pa., near
Philadelphia.

The events leading to her con-
dition are mysterious, even to her

Meter maids will he the primary
enforcers of the permit parking rules
although police could. issue a ticket

_to a violator. But, according to one

police officer at the Oakland pre-
cinct, no information on the sticker
parking program has been relayed to
his station. V

“You know how much we know?
What we read in The ~ Oakland
News,” an officer at the Oakland
precinct said. “We haven’t been
given any directives on what to do."

“It is really not a police function
to enforce the sticker parking, ”Phil-
lips said. “Working through the pro-
gram with the City Planning Office,

it was decided that meter maids
would be used to enforce the
program.” «

- The ~ affected streets, include
Halket, Halket Place, Coltart,
Zulema, Bates (from the Boulevard

of the Allies to Zulema), Chester-

field, Buffalo and Feeney Way.
Residents ‘in those areas have

already purchased 265 residential

permits, each costing,$l0, and 275-

Semester At Sea

Sets Sail Again

The S. S. Universe, the ship used
in the Semester at Sea program, sets

sail today for the beginning of the ‘

Fall term on the high seas. Ports of
call include Japan, South’ Korea,
Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, India, Israel, Egypt, Greece
and Morocco.

‘Along with books, students will i

also be taking with them the
memory of when the ship ran
aground last spring and they were
forced to spend the remainder of the
term in a hotel in Jerusalem.

Lynn Roberts, a sophomore at
Pitt, was a student on board the Uni-
verse last winter when the mechani-
cal problems occurred. ‘She said,
however, that the grounding did not
take the pleasure away from the trip.

“I really, really enjoyed it,” she
said. -“I think I learned more on that
then I would in any school I might
have gone to.”

Students attend classes while they In

are on the ship and are relieved from
their studies when the Universe_pulls
into a port. Roberts said she learned
while touring the countries because
students were expected to apply
their classroom studies while “on
leave.” Often times, she said, they
would have to write a paper or give a
report about what they learned
while touring a certain country.

The thing that struck Roberts was
the friendliness of the citizens of the
countries they visited.

For example, when they were in
Cadiz, Spain, some of the students,
including Roberts, were looking for
a world famous restaurant in the
town and became lost. They hap-
pened across a woman selling goods
from a stall on the street. The
woman did not speak English and
the group of students did not speak
Spanish. So, instead of trying to
explain to the students how to get

there, the woman left her stall and ‘

restaurant—a two—mile hike; When
they got to the restaurant, it was
closed but the woman, she said,
remained cheerful as she made her
way back to her stall.

When the ship ran aground, the

students at first were very worried, ,

but they thought the damage was
minor. They had to make a 15-hour
trip.across the Sinai Desert on buses
to reach Jerusalem. Two days after

they arrived in Jerusalem, they got '

the news that the "ship was beyond
repair. Initially, Roberts said, every-
one was very depressed. Their spir-
its, however, started picking up after
a ‘couple days. F

“We realized that we could learn a .

lot there to,” she said. .

’ Then, just as the students were
getting over the grounding, Tobias
Dunkelberger, the academic dean,
died.

depressed,” Roberts said. “It was

about five days before everyone’s ‘

feelings started back on the
upswing.” — ’
There was some apprehension
about being in Israel because of the
fighting in the Middle East, but
Roberts said there was no real fright

on the part of the students. She was .

almost caught in the middle of a riot.

She and a friend were in a shop;
when word came that there was
going to be a riot. The shopkeeper
made them coffee and tea and kept
them in the store until the rock-
throwing crowd dispersed.

“They [the shopkeepers] were
extremely protective of the tourists

because their businesses thrive on-

itourists,” Roberts said. .
The students that were on the

spring trip were offered their money _-

back or a chance to go on another
cruise in the future. Roberts said she

will go on the cruise in the spring of -

1985.

people who rent or lease commercial
property and actively engage in busi-
ness in the permit area are also
entitled to a permit. No more than
one parking permit will be issued for
each business establishment.

hope to expand the program to

cover all of central Oakland, west
Oakland (those streets in the vacin-
ity of Trees Hall) and the Bellefield
area, according to Phillips.

“We worked with the residents for
years to make sure they wanted this
program,” Phillips said. “For the
students who are residents, it is
going to make their life a lot easier.
For the commuter, it is going to
make them think more about where
they are going to park their car.”

The search for long-term solu-
tions to the scarcity of parking in
Oakland continues, but it is hoped
that programs such as permit park-
ing and van pooling will bring relief.

  Animal
Rights

There’s been a furor raised lately by animal-rights
groups about the use of animals in laboratory settings.
These groups are concerned about anima1s’being used
for experimental purposes by drug companies and
other researchers. '

Some of this fury, however, is unwarranted. While it
is ethically wrong to use an animal in unnecessary
experiments, the use of animals in laboratories is
necessary for the health and welfare of the people of
this country. '

Animals have given their lives for such great causes
as cancer research, drug research and other notable

_causes. 9

Without the use of animals for experimental pur-
poses, Dr. Jonas Salk may not have come up with a

vaccine for polio or Dr. Thomas Starzl might not be .

able to perform life-saving liver transplants. The death
of these animals was worth the hundreds of human
lives that have been saved in the past and will be saved
in the future by the experiments that were performed
on them. ‘

In a recent article, The New York Times reported
that the Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences was planning to shoot anesthetized dogs so
students could learn how to treat bullet wounds.

Animal-rights groups alerted the government, and
the uproar in Congress and the coverage it received
from the news media was so great that Defense Secre-

_ tary Caspar Weinberger blocked the program and the

dogs were saved. _

This is an ‘instance where cruelty to animals for
experimental purposes should not be tolerated. The
use of animals for purposes such as this is unnecessary
and should be stopped at all costs. Luckily, these
animal-rights groups were able to stop this slaughter
before it took place.

Other experiments that should come to a halt are
those in which the outcome is known. There have been
reports, for example, of researchers’ putting animals in
cold temperatures to see how long it takes before they
freeze.

Other experiments include tying up cats and contin-
uously blowing smoke into their faces to see if they
develop cancer. The medical community told the
world years ago that non-smokers could develop

I cancer by breathing second-hand smoke, so these

types of experiments are also unnecessary.

Animals in laboratory settings are needed in some I

cases and are beneficial to the health of the nation, but
there must be a limit on their uses. Experiments such
as shooting dogs and freezing monkeys are useless,
cruel and unethical. _

If there is a limit imposed-, animals will continue to
‘serve the needs of mankind by giving their lives so
people can live, but animals themselves will be able to
live instead of dying toﬂserve the needs of researchers
using them unnecessarily/.

An Old Problem Resurfaces

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

It’s that time of year again, folks.
Time to gripe and complain about
parking (or lack of) in Oakland.

Oakland parking has not gotten
any better in the two years that I've
been commuting; in fact, it’s gotten
worse. The three most popular park-
ing spaces _— those in between Hill-

man and Carnegie Libraries, those

in front of the ‘Cathedral and those
in front of the Syria Mosque —— are
ﬁlled by 9:30 or 10 a.m. So, many
commuters are forced to be in Oak-
land hours before their classes start
to ensure themselves a - parking
space.

Even theexpensive parking lots
around campus are filling up in the
early morning hours, so in addition
to paying high prices to park in a lot,
students also have to make sure they
are here by 9 a.m. to get a space.

To add to all this misery, thecity
has started a new sticker program in
parts of South Oakland. This means
that cars that are parked on Coltart,
Zulema, Chesterfield, Buffalo,
Bates, Halket, Halket Place and
Feeney Way will be fined $25 if they
do not have a residence sticker.
Many students had parked on these
streets and walked to campus to save
money.

These new restrictions are going
to bring a surge of parkers from that
area closer to campus. City taxpay-
ers are now not permitted to park on
the streets for which they pay.

In a recent issue of Pittsburgh
Magazine, Pittsburghers who were

surveyed gave an unanimous-

response to the question: where is
the worst area of the city to park?
The answer? Oakland, of course.
The parking situation for me
came to a head last Tuesday. I drove
my car to school as I normally do
and arrived on campus at 9 a.m. All
the parking lots in the immediate

vicinity were already filled. In addi-
tion to the normal parkers — stu-
dents, faculty and staff — the

Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers

was holding a contract meeting at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall.
That meant hundreds of extra cars
on campus that were not supposed
to be there.

I drove all around campus, side
streets, up to North Oakland (I
couldn’t park t-here because of street
cleaning) "down to South Oakland
and every place I. could think of.
Finally, after 50 minutes of driving, I
was so disgusted over the lack of
parking and all the gas I had wasted,
I just turned around and went back
home. '

Why couldn’t -the city’s' teachers
meet in a different place, such as one

_of the schools? Schenley High

School isvjust up the street from
Soldiers and Sailors. Why couldn’t
they have their meeting there and
allow the parking spaces for people
who deserve them — the students?

Also, last Wednesday, valuable
spaces in front of the Cathedral were
being reserved for the alumni and
Board of Trustees members who
were on campus attending grand

opening ceremonies for the William»

Pitt Union. Although the ceremony
did not officially begin until 4:30
p.m., “No Parking” signs were set up
by 9 in the morning. Seven and a half
hours of wasted space that would
have gladly been accepted by any
commuter student. Why shouldn’t
the alumni and the board members
have had to struggle for a space like

the rest of us? They shouldn’t be
afforded special privileges.

Parking in Oakland is a problem
that needs to be taken care of imme-

diately. Commuters can bitch and .

complain all they want, but action
needs to be taken. A large part of the
responsibilty falls on the shoulders
of the Commuter Association, the
Student Government Board and the
College of General Studies Student
‘Cabinet; these are the groups that
are supposed to have the best inter-
ests of students in mind.

The city and the university need to
be -pressured into providing more

parking spaces for students, faculty .

and staff. The university spent mil-
lions of dollars renovating the stu-
dent union, building a new business
school and building new fraternity‘
houses; why can't they spend a little
more money to construct more
parking spaces? It’s about time that
commuters gain some respect at this
university. After all, we are the
majority.

We pay so much tuition to this
school we should at least be able to
attend classes here. Many students
ﬁnd themselves missing the_ first 10
or 15 minutes of a class because of
parking- headaches.

The Commuter Association has
instituted a new Commuter Car
Pool program, but that’s not
enough. Stronger action needs to be
taken by this group. It should spend
a week or two collecting signatures
on a petition calling for more park-
ing spaces around Oakland and then
present it to the university adminis-
tration. If that doesn’t _work, they
should take stronger action such as a
demonstration to attract media

attention to the problem.

The Commuter Association has
gone from being a committee of

Tim McFarlane, who holds a

Population

By TIM HUNTER

One of the major concerns for
many biologists is the increasing
world population. I suppose it’s
rather easy for the average person to
sit.back, look out over the vast
stretches of land and feel there is

‘plenty of room and resources for

everyone. The truth of the matter is a
3 percent annual growth rate
throughout the world. That basi-
cally means there are 200,000 more
births than deaths each year, and
every 23 yearstthe population of the
world doubles.

The world will not be able to fulfill
man’s needs much longer. Let’s con-

groups.

McFarlane said he believes that
Americans will also have more lei-
sure time as computers take on an
increasing amount of our work. The
results of these trends will be a sub-

stantial increase in the demand for »

hotel sales and marketing personnel
as established hotels expand and
new hotels are opened. "

McFarlane’s job in the Hyatt’s
sales and marketing department is

research to determine aspects of the
hotel that would appeal to various

tourism- The second function per-

sider a few of the long-term statistics
that have been estimated by some
biologists. If the world had only a 2
percent growth rate, in 500 years,
each person would only have one
square meter of land to himself. The
United States presently has a 2 per-
cent growth rate; if it were 1 percent,
then it would only take 380 years
before each person had one square
meter of land. The U.S. has already
utilized much of its space.

Let’s say some engineers decided
to build apartments or something of
that sort, so the population could
keep growing. It is estimated that in
5,000 years, at 2 percent world
growth, the‘ mass of new bodies

OBJECTIVE: To enhance the exposure

success in sales depends upon the
ability of sales personnel to deal with
the public and project the hotel’s
image.

Aside from having an ability to

work with people and deal with the

public, there are no speciﬁc qualiﬁ-
cations necessary for hotel sales and
marketing. Although some schools
offer a hotel management curricu-
lum, almost any liberal arts degree
would be sufficient academic prepa-
ration. The best way to obtain a sales
and marketing position is to start
near the bottom with a front-desk
position.

"A job that includes contact with

guests will pay well, and one can
work his way up in 1% yearsto sales

and marketing and make money, '

too," said McFarlane. '

Good Idea

u

the earth would expand at a rate of

-approximately 186 thousand miles’

per second. Needless to say, we
would run out of resources long
before that. ' ’

What should our great leaders
and scientists do? How about ship-N
ping people of the earth to other

planets or building space stations. .

That is a nice idea, but there is still a
problem with resources.

Suppose that somehow the scient-
ists found a way to get new resources
from some other place and the engi-
neers actually did find a way to build
apartments apartments that
covered the entire earth. It is esti-
mated that by the time these apart-
ments reached 2,000 stories, the heat
evolved from the population alone
would be enough to melt iron, thus
collapsing the apartments.

It’s rather obvious that the only
solution to the problem is zero pop-
ulation growth. That can only come
about through education and use of
birth control.

.The ‘governments of the world
must change their priorities. In 1967,
the U.S. spent 33 million dollars on
birth control. That may seem like a
lot, but relatively speaking, that
amount of money in 1967 could run
the Pentagon for only three hours.

. We, as future parents, must also
look at ourselves. We can’t depend
only on concerned biologists to pre-
pare for the future. We must make
intelligent plans for family sizes. We‘
can’t just sit back with an attitude of ‘
indifference and keep contributing
to the problem, for soon (on an evo- '
lutionary scale) there will be no
place to put the eontributions.

‘By MARTY WILLIS

Today, more than ever, the eyes of
the world are on Central America.
The revolutionary conflicts of that
troubled region have produced so
many seemingly contradictory
reports and emotional versions of
current reality that a real need has
developed among concerned people
everywhere for up-to-date, reliable
information devoid of dogmatic
biases. Harold Sims, full professor
in the History Department at Pitt,
can provide that information, and
when this scholar talks, people
listen. ,,

“I see myself, really, as a source of
information in Western Pennsylva-
nia on what’s going on in Central
America,” Sims said, explaining his
relatively new-found role as a public
speaker at college campuses, '
churches and schools in the area.
”People need the information, and
they’re sure not getting it from the
President. They’re sure not getting it
from the media in Western Pennsyl-
vania; the Post-Gazette and Press
coverage of Central America is
pathetic.”

Ed Lehoucq, a senior at Pitt
majoring in history, has collabo-
rated with Sims on two papers on
the political and historical context
of land reform in El Salvador. :
Lehoucq speaks for many when he

_describes what makes this man

“Hal” such a favorite among stu-
dents and colleagues.

“As a person, he’s one of the most
principled persons I’ve _ever met,”
Lehoucq said. “His honesty as a
scholar is beyond doubt, his dealing
with the facts as opposed to what
one would like the facts to be, which
is very important now with all the
current debate on Central America;
he's a good example of honesty in
scholarship.”

“He’s such a terrific person,”
Lehoucq continued. “He loves to
talk to students and, as a freshman,I
started talking to him. I began to see
him in his office. Without a doubt,

he’s the person on campus most
familiar with what’s going on in the

Isthmus. In fact, he’s probably the

most knowledgeable person in‘

Western Pennsylvania.”

Harold Sims was born in Florida
some 45 years ago. ,

“My family was quite poor, with-
out a lot of. education,” he
explained. “Nobody on either side of
my family had finished high school,
much less gone to college. My father
had only a third-grade education,”
he said. A

After the family moved to St.
Petersburg, Sims attended and grad-
uated from a high school that he
describes as not being “hick.”

“I tried taking courses at a local
junior college, but I was flunking
out. Ijoined the Air Force and spent

four*years in it. There I matured. I
was a mechanic, and they sent me to
El Paso on the Mexican border. I
taught myself Spanish. I was fasci-
nated by the cultural differences
across the border. Although I was
depressed by the poverty, I was also
intrigued by why one side could be
so poor and the other side so rich."
The question stayed in the back of
my mind for many years to come
and ultimately led me to go to gradu-
ate school.”

At 22, Sims entered Stetson Uni-'
versity as a freshman. Initially a bus-
iness major, he switched to
philosophy and then to history.

“I majored in European history
because they didn’t even have one
course in Latin American history
back then,” he said with a smile.

Pursuing his earlier interest in
Latin America, Sims went to gradu-
ate school at the University of
Florida.

“What I didn’t know then is that

thatcareer would open up in» the
early 1960s because of Fidel
Castro.”

In 1964, he won a Ford Founda-
tion scholarship and spent a year
studying political science, econom-
ics and sociology at the University of
California-Berkeley and the Univer-
sity of Texas. After a year in Mexico
doing research toward his disserta-
tion, Sims attended a scholarly con-
ference in California and
interviewed for a teaching position

‘ at Pitt while at the conference.

“There were 12 of _us and 22 jobs
available. That’s how I got the job
here at Pitt,” he.said calmly and
without sarcasm. “I’m the only per-
son in the history department here
who went to a Southern university.”

5

Now entering his 18th year at Pitt, I

his entire teaching career, Sims is
currently teaching three courses.
Two are introductory surveys of
modern Latin America; the third,
offered through the University
Honors Program, is entitled “Cen-
tral American Revolutions and the
U.S. Response.” It is through his
meticulous study of this last topic
that Sims has earned his lofty repu-
tation around Pittsburgh in the last
five years. “In the profession, my
reputation is primarily in early 19th
century history,” Sims said. “For
years, I was a 19th-century specialist
working on social and race relations.
Then in 1977, I began to work on the
Panama Canal issue. My first public
speaking appearance was a shocking
experience. I’was hooted out of a
meeting of the Rotary Club in Oak-
land. I was even‘ called a Commu-
nist. I didn’t realize there was so
much chauvinism« and so many

primitive opinions on what our for- '

eign policy should be. From that
point on, I became much more
active in Central American issues,

-especially the Nicaraguan Revolu-

tion in 1978 and 1979. “I never

" dreamed that I would be one, who
'- would follow contemporary events

so avidly. In fact, when I was an
undergraduate, I didn’t even read
newspapers. I didn’t have time for
newspapers. Now I have time for
little else. To stay on top of this stuff,
I have to work really hard.”

Reteaching the Brain, Regaining The Child

continued from page one
mother. “All I know is my
daughter was a normal healthy
child in first grade,” Mrs. Garda
said.

In November of 1980, accord-
ing to her mother, Jodi was home
from school because of snow.
She played in the snow that day,
and felt fine, her mother said.

J odi’s father had noticed that
her body was a bit swollen that
evening while he and his wife
were bathing Jodi and her sister.

Mrs. Garda said she called
Jodi’s doctor, and that he was
not overly concerned about her
condition.

Her condition worsened, and
by the time she was rushed to
Children’s Hospital, Jodi had
difficulty breathing and was put
on a respirator. Mrs. Garda said
that the doctors thought it was
streptococcus, but were not sure.
They also said she was not
expected to live because her
heart had started to fail.

“The doctors said we needed a _

miracle, and we got one,” Mrs.
Garda said. “It was a long, hard,
rocky road, but we made it.”

. Jodi has permanent brain
damage, and Mrs. Garda said

she’s not sure how it happened. _

The reports at first were very

grim. Mrs. Garda said that doc-_,

tors told her that Jodi was blind
and that she would never walk or
talk again.

Jodi came home on June 19,
1981, and had a private-duty
nurse to look after her. “Then we
took over her care,” Mrs. Garda
said.

Mrs. Garda said that she and
herhusband refused to put Jodi
in a home, though they had been
advised to. “We thank God for it.
I’ll tell you what...where would
she be if we listened to everyone
else?” Mrs. Garda said.

The Gardas looked for almost
a year to find programs or clinics
to help J odi. They were told
about the Spitz Clinic by the par-
ents of a boy with brain damage
they had met at a rehabilitation
clinic here in Pittsburgh. “They
(the parents) showed me the
way,” Mrs. Garda said.

Mrs. Garda said the doctors at
the clinic really know how to talk
to parents. “All they said was to
give Jodi a chance,” Mrs. Garda
said.

According to J odi’s mother,
she has made much progress in
the last year. She no longer has to
be fed by tube, she has good head
control, pushes herself across the
room in a cart with some assist-
ance, stands in a special box for
an hour or so each day, can turn

over by herself, and is on her
second “pattern". “Even the doc-
tors are amazed,” said Mrs.
Garda.

Jodi goes back to the clinic for
testing every three to five
months. The trips are paid for by
the Jodi Garda fund that was
started by Channel II.

The local rotary, police and
others also helped raise money to

finance J odi’s trips back to the

clinic and other needs.

“We have a long way to go,’
Mrs. Garda said. “She is getting
stronger and stronger.”

According to Mrs. Garda,
Jodi’s EEGs have shown more
and more brain activity over the
past two years. Mrs. Garda de-
scribes her beautiful blue-eyed
daughter as stubborn, though.
“She lets me know what she likes
and doesn’t like,” Mrs. Garda
said. =

“I know my daughter is gonna

9

'win,” Mrs. Garda said. “She will

be the child she once was. We
even have ‘J odi‘s Gonna Win’.T-
shirts, that people can buy to
help the fund.”

For more information about
Jodi, or if you are interested in
volunteering, you can contact

her parents Ron and Pat Garda»

By MARK A. SINDLER

Prior to the start of Pitt’s football
home opener against Temple Satur-
day afternoon, betting lines across

the nation had the Panthers pegged

15 1/2 point favorites.

Some folks didjustice to their ear-
lier perspicacity by reducing that
margin from 18 points.

To laugh at such ajoke, Joari Riv-
ers would already be in stitches.

Finding themselves a second suc-
cessful quarterback in as many
weeks, the Panthers undividedly
scrambled the Owls’ brains in av35-0
romp before a less than-packed
house of 45,713.  A

One soul who found the cookin
just to his liking was John Congemi,

A the sophomore quarterback from
Lauderdale,Lakes, F1a., whom head
coach Foge . Fazio tagged as his
replacement for John Cummings
and his dismembered left
collarbone.

Congemi'wasted no time in show-

ing he is the one to look to for conti-
nuity at a so-far unstable position,
once heopened the first play of the
game with a five-yard screen to
flanker Dwight Collins. Onthe day,
Congemi completed 15 of 23- passes
for 177 yards and tallied once in the
TD and interception departments.

“It felt great to get my first start,” ‘

Congemi said afterwards..“I went

into the game trying to do the best
job I can.” '

Pitt’s defense abetted early» in

Collier  
Wary Of  
The Test

‘ By MARK A. SINDLER

Easy going and generally. a
wheeler-dealer in strategic terms.
Nothing comes quite as close as de-
scribing women‘s volleyball coach,
Shelton Collier.as accurately as that.

The teams he has been coaching
the last three years reveal an exact
philosophy behind the abundant
success such seasons have shown.
And when Collier talks about the
players he has fashioned or about
the. realistic chances of an opposing
squad overpowering his, his words
come nothing short of blunt.

Look for slight to everexpanding
changes in such directness as the

—week slowly and tiringly wears on.‘

Already there emanates signs of Col-
lier turning fidgety in his approach.
He converses more sporadically
than continuously.

Anxiety covers him now like con-
tact lenses around the eyeball.

' There may be good reason, of
course, for these swerving tenden-
cies in appearance. The Lady Panth-
ers are now 10-0 after winning two
straight tournaments. Certainly
nothing to shed tears over.

Yet that is hardly what concerns
Collier. Those 10 match victories
came against teams having volley-
ball depth equal to that of a puddle
on a rain-soaked sidewalk. The last
six came this past weekend in the
Pitt Round Robin tournament, one
which attracted five other schools.

.»-.L - . . . '.

ter, the Owls’ offensive line failed to
pick up drop-end Al Wenglikowski,
who followed through in sacking
senior Tim Riordan for-a safety.
From there, the game’s intensity
level was set and never again
disturbed.

 

 

A Pitt head coach Foge Fazio may have found himself a solid quarterback in sophomore ‘J ohn
Congemi, who piled up 1.77 passing yards against Temple.

“Anytime you make a play like
that,” Wenglikowski offered, “it’s
going to set the tempo for
everything.”

Especially so for Pitt’s defense.
Wenglikowski led all tacklers with
11, followed by linebacker Caesar

Th_ese five schools were dis-
patched with as much efficiency as
exhibited last week in the Pitt Pre-
view. On Saturday evening, Robert
Morris stepped forward as the first
victim, falling 15-3, 15-1, 15-0. Later
that evening, the Lady Panthers
dumped Toledo 16-14, 15-9, 15-6.

Yesterday, a tale no different had
all the makings of non-fiction. As if
Toledo could not find its fill'the
night before, Pitt again lashed out in

whippingpfashion 15-9. 15-13.’

better 15-3, 15-6. Lastly, Duquesne
watched bleary-eyed as the Lady
Panthers posted two 15-5 defeats on
its uniforms.

It is not inconceivable to think
that such winning habits would
leave Collier with smilesas wide-as a
canyon across his mustachioed face.
Nothing could be further from] the

truth.

Aldisert’s eight. The largest
improvement could be seen in the
unit's decreased amount of time
spent on the field as compared to last
week against Tennessee.

That can be attributed to Conge-
mi’s resemblance of veteran tenden-

cies. After relinquishing two drives
to punts and one to an interception
by cornerback Pervis Herder, Con-~
gemi survived an otherwise scoreless
first quarter and dug in at Pitt’s 43.
The big gainer in the series was
Congemi’s connection with tight end
Clint Wilson, who picked up the first '
down and 26 yards to boot. Moving
the ball along with ground gainers-4
by fu_llback Marlon Mclntyre and

- tailback Joe McCall, Congemiexe-'

cuted his second option of the series

and scored from one yard out with i

12:52 to go before halftime.
Mclntyre started Pitt’s fifth series "
with a nifty 16-yard, around left-end
run. Four plays later, Congemi,]
found split end Bill Wallace eating

Once junior fullback Marc Bailey
pickedgup four more yards and put ’
Pitt on Temple's 14, Congemi next
threw a strike to Collins, who darted
45 degrees to the endzone’s left
corner, leaving cornerback Anthony
Young in desperate pursuit and
placing the Panthers in the lead 18-0. ‘
Bailey was one _of six‘ running
backs used by Fazio. McCall turned
out a late scratch from starting due
to his bruised ribs. Sophomore Dar-
nell Stone started instead,,netting 47
yards on 10 carries. McCall satu-
rated the Owls’ ineffective line with
45 yards on 13 handoffs once he,
entered the contest with 9:35?"
remaining in the first quarter. _

Find Their Niche     1

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Looking at the Pitt football offen-
sive units of the past seven years, one
can rave about -outstanding receiv-
ing corps. Names like Gordon
Jones, Ralph Still, Willie Collier,
Jirn5 Corbett, Steve Gaustad and,
more recently, Julius Dawkins,
John Brown, Barry Compton and
Dwight Collins come to mind.

‘But what of the 1983 corps, which

made considerable contributions in _

Saturday‘s 35-0 whipping of cross-
state rival Temple? What comes to
mind when names such as Dwight
Collins, Bill Wallace, Darryl Clark
and C1int‘Wilson come into focus?

Well, Collins and Wilson are no
problem in identifying, but who are
Bill Wallace and Darryl Clark’?

“They’re both outstanding receiv-
ers,” said" Pitt head coach Foge
Fazio after the Panthers trampled
Temple, “and they both played very
well today. We’re very fortunate to
have them on our football team.”

Wallace is a senior academically,
although he has two years ofeligibi1-
ity remaining because he was red-
shirted in 1982.

Prior to the season, Fazio pin-
pointed Wallace asfonei who will
make a contribution to ._the 1983
Panther squad.

“Bill has great hands,” Fazio said.
“lt was a big surprise to see him drop
a ball [referring to thedroppedpass
in the third quarter], but he" had a

, great 'day. ” '

 

\

’After a less than auspicious

’opener at Tennessee, where he

grabbed one John Cummings aerial

for 17 yards, Wallace teamed with ‘

John Congemi and totaled 60 yards
on four catches Saturday afternoon,
as be continually exposed the gaping
holes throughout the Temple pass
coverages. . it

“We were ab1e_,to‘ run outs and
square-ins all day,” Wallace said.

“[The Temple defensive backs]
were playing off the line about nine
yards. The linebackers were playing

 

 

'_h

in. As a result, the middle was open, . 

and we could run all the routes that
we wanted.

“We thought that Temple would:
have made some adjustments at
halftime. We figured that-_ they
would have to close the cushion that
they were giving us. But they didn’t
and we wereiable to do ‘the same
things in the second half."

It was in that first half that the
Panthers got rolling following a
safety registered by the defense in
the person of defensive end Al
Wenglikowski. ‘

Prior to’ that, the offense was"
moving the ball but not sco'ring.~

“[The safety] fired us up,” Wallace‘
said. “We figured, the" defense
started something; why not turn.it
into something big.” 3 ‘

The rest of the afternoon was full if

of big things for the Pitt offense,‘

which totaled 460 yards, 283 on the s

ground and 177 through the air, and ..
posted 33 ‘of the team’s 35 points.

Booters’ 1-0 Win Evens Record

The Pitt soccer team evened its
record to 2-2 with a 1-0 win over
Grove City Friday night at Pitt
Stadium.

Panther forward Spanky
Lucke scored what proved to be

the winning goal” at the-25:40

mark of the second half. The
assist came from Dave Van
Newkirk.

Pitt dominated the play
throughout the game, outshoot-
ing the Wolverines 19-6, but
missed on several scoring
opportunities.

“We missed a lot of open
goals,”‘coach Leo Bemis said.
“And we had one shot to go over
the crossbar. We outplayed them
,yet they were still in the game.

One goal would have tied it.”

The Panthers recovered from
a disastrous road trip, in which
they were outscored 10-0 in two
games. Lack of preparation was
the problem, but Bemis believes
the team is ready now.

“We had six days of practice
before going down to Virginia,”
Bemis said. “Both George
Washington and George Mason
had three times as much practice.

One improvement over last
year’s team, according to Bemis,
is ball control, especially around
the middle of the field.

“The difference between this
year’s team, and last years is the
ability to hold the ball on the
attack. We had problems in the
first game, but during the second
game, it started to come along.
explained. "V ’

The improvement in this area
will depend upon the develop-
ment of the younger players in
the lineup.

“With the exception ofSparky
Lucke,” Bemis said, “all of our
attackers are freshmen. The
potential is there to improve and
do better.”

Pitt will take it’s two-game
winning streak, up to Latrobe
Wednesday evening as they face
small-college power St. Vincent.
Later on in the week, the Panth-
ers will face Slippery Rock Fri-
day night at Pitt Stadium

Bemis believes both teams will
give Pitt a challenge.

-V “St. Vincent is a good team,
and they're tough at home,” he
said. Last year they beat us at

ter with the tailback. That was more
convenient, so we kept using it.

“The play is designed for the full-
back to run off the tackles and
guard’s block -- it’s like a belly, but
he’s taking it straight up field, ‘a

‘ north-south run.”

M’.

Pitt moved the ball up and down
the- new Superturf "field in similar
fashion in the second half. By now,

" Fazio started instituting second and

third teams into lines on both sides
of -scrimmage. Eight different line-
backers played as did 11 various de-
fensive ends and tackles.

The offensive line saw three differ-
ent centers, seven guards andeighte

incongruous split ends, flankers and
tight ends.

Fazio more than aired out his
bench. He ransacked the cobwebs.

“We tried substituting early,”
Fazio remarked. “You can never be
satisfied. Eleven is not good, 18 is
nice; and 22 is security.”

Senior Jim Sweeney, who started

beside mammoth Bill Fralic at left .

guard and later switched between
there and center, said, “It was all so
systematic. (Offensive line) coach
Moore’s philosophy is you can never
have five linemen. If you have eight
linemen who are healthy, if you have
10 men, then they’ll play. I

“It all depends on practice.(as to -

who will play).” .

Throughout most of the first two
quarters, Pitt’s running plays de-
veloped via that left side as Fazio
evidently wanted to adjust his right
side of Bob and Tony Brown, both
sophomores, who started at guard
and tackle, respectively.

No matter. After Temple’s Kip

_Shenefelt punted for the sixth time,

leaving Pitt to move left to right
across this newspaper page from its
25, Congemi ran 15 plays and con-
sumed 5:52 to push Pitt further
ahead 28-0.

in that series, Stone ran literally
untouched for 32 yards, picked up
two key first downs and plunged in
from Temple’s one for six points.

The Panthers‘ final score -- decor-
ative pieces on the icing -- came
when Pitt’s “other quarterback,”
Chris Jelic, entered the game with
12:32 to go and ran off nine plays in
4:48 before scampering around right
end from four yards out dove over
the goal line to. finalize, scoring
matters.

It was a score that brought Tem-
ple back to reality after dumping
Syracuse 17-6 the week before. And
Fazio will take the ‘W’ anyway he

‘can.

“You can’t do better than 2-0, but
we have a lot of work to do,” Fazio

said, indicating that happiness is still ’

hard to find in shutouts.
Paradoxically, Fazio believes past

‘quarterback instability, though far

from what he sees as independently
capable, appears more established.

Especially since Congemi doggedly
punctured Temple’s secondary for
over three quarters, and one week
off aids in the integration process.
~“Both those quarterbacks (Con-
gemi and Jelic) have a great atti-
tude," Fazio said. “There’s no
bickering, both are behind each oth-
er’s teams. Both, like I said, have so
much in common that is associated
with a quarterback’s attitude: They
are so sure of themselves.” \
Undoubtedly their teammates feel
no differently, coming off two’ con-
secutive wins. I

10-09 Record To Stand Test Of Determination 

continued from page nine

You see, the fourth-year coach is
setting his sights, though how
unnerving they may seem on the
upcoming weekend. In the Pitt Clas-

sic, Top 20 schools in stature of

Florida State, Penn State and
Louisville are entering town with
artillery that would leave the infam-
ous George Patton shaking in his
boots. A
' “Is a week enough time to get
ready for it?" Collier asked rhetori-
cally. “In a week, we'll find .out
whether it's enough. We've beaten
Penn State enough to know if we can
beat them again.
This is the same man who talks
with his thoughts fixated on a dis-
tant object. It is an object resembling

/ the unknown. It is a sign of the mys-

terious, of not knowing what to
expect.

He is preparing for The Test.

‘'1 think it is really hard to say

-[how we'll fare],," Collier emphas-

ized. “We've not been challenged at
that level. That's the fun of team
sports. You don’t know.

“As for me, I don't know how this
team will play together. They
haven't played under pressure yet.”

I The Pitt News, Monday, September 12, 1983

Thank the lords in heaven Collier
still has some humor to expend.
Minimally speaking, he did get the
opportunity this past weekend to
play all I0 of his roster players. As
uneventful as the Pitt Round Robin
may sound when playing against
such no-name schools, Collier used
not only that invitational, but last
week’s as well, to hone his team and
create a solid unit.

“It's not so much boring as we've
needed to work things in a non-
threatening environment,” he
explained. “On our side of the net,
we're still making mistakes. '

“Make those next weekend and
we'll lose." If anything signiﬁcant
came out of the weekend competi-
tion, ColIier's primary servers, Judy
Young and Cathy Rupp, dominated
all in that department.

“Basically, we're growing and
developing," Collier said. “But we're
still untesféd this early‘, "This week.‘
end will be‘ the real test."

There it is again, The.Test. Four-
teen days of practicing and playing
against subterranean-type schools
are supposed to prime such schools
against the powerhouses of schools
Pitt has yet to face.

Going into the weekend, the Lady
Panthers currently have three slots
nailed down. Young, the team's cap-
tain, and Rupp, both juniors, are
slated to start as setters in the mint
condition 6-2 offense Collier is going
with for the first time.

That, even though Young had her
left ankle X-rayed_ last night after she
sprained it late in the second game
against Duquesne.

Anotherjunior, Ulana Kohutiak,
is a sure-fire starter at middle hit-
ting/ blocking. Beyond that, Collier
wrinkles his forehead a little more
and twitches his thumbs in nervous
motion. I

Cause for that comes from not
knowing whether his towering sky-
scraper, Carmen Tapia (5-ll), will
“have adjusted" in time for the Pitt
Classic.

“Carmen is regaining the form
that she left here with [during the

spring]," Collier explained. “Over

the summer, I'm not sure. Our style
is different than that of the Puerto
Rican national team.

“She needs to go through an
adjustment period."

Tapia is coming off another
summer with her native country's
squad and is entering her second sea-
son of integration sincejoining Col-
lier's roster last autumn.

Collier is depending on the sopho-
more who quickly established her-
self as a leader in a year that saw her
start practicallyevery match.

“Carmen is playing much,‘much
stronger," Collier said. “She is get-
ting back into the Pitt system. I do
know that the last two years, it has
taken her an adjustment period. It's
partly due to her lifestyle, partly to
the training methods.

“The sooner she regains her form,

the better."

For Pitt's sake, that remains

_ another objective of Collier's, the

least of which in the face of the
squads Pitt will play. The fact
remains inescapable that the compe-
tition Pitt has squared off against
offered resistance found only with
quicksand.

Friday night that will change.
Collier is counting on his squad to
make the mandatory adjustments.

“We need to make more quality
plays,” he continued. “It depends on
that. You play only as good as your
first pass. I

“Sometimes we were getting that
first pass [this weekend]. To have
won this weekend with “sometimes"
is not enough. Next weekend,
“sometimes” will not be enough. We
still have a lot of work, really.”

Sounds believable enough. No
one knows yet whether the all

important factor of intensity will be‘

there, though. '

“Next week is going to be some
real intense matches," Collier hypo-
thesized, prior to the conclusion of
the Duquesne match yesterday. This
weekend, we played with some of the
excitement and intensity that we're
going to need next weekend."

With that, Collier walked off with
unsure steps. He knows what his
team has come up against so far. The
wins have been dropping into his
hands more easily than raindrops do

in a bucket.

But now comes the task akin to
walking between those raindrops
without getting soaked.

The Pitt News, Monday, September 12, 1983

i;p}gé13’il,  

continued from page nine
Sounds like the Dan Marino days,
when Wallace was far from a first
teamer.

“[Getting to start] feels great,” he
said. “I feel a lot more involved.
Before, I thought that I was a part of
the team but this is a lot different.

“It’s a good feeling knowing that A

the guys around you are depending
on you. We're a real close team.”

Looking ahead to the Maryland
game two weeks from now, Wallace
is anticipating much more than the
Owls offered Pitt.

“They’re a great team,” the F1531‘
ington, NJ. native said. “They play
a defense similar to Temple’s but

caught two passes from Congemi in
the first half for 20 yards.

“[The Tennessee game] was a
great experience gettingto play four
quarters," Clark said. “In the past,
when I got in we were always so far
ahead. It feels a lot different having
the weight of the game on your
shoulders.” 4

‘‘He’s the most unselﬁsh football
player on the team," Fazio said of
Clark. “He is a super receiver but he
wants to help any way that he can.
He said he wants toiplay on our
kickoff and punt teams so that he
could contribute.” -

Pitt football to the Florida native
is nothing new; his cousin, Rodney
Clark, played the ﬂanker position
for the Panthers’ 1976 ‘national

championship team, so he’s quite

h I h T 1 . aware of his predecessors.
they s ow a at more t an emp e -

does. We have almost two weeks to
prepare but it’s going to be: a good
game.”

 
  

The other receiver making waves,
as was previously noted, is junior
Darryl Clark, a native of Miami,
Florida. - ‘

Though he entered Saturday’s
contest without having made a catch 4- Wuslich V

“'1 Receivers Wallace, Clark Make Their M arkInPitt Win“ 

Though Clark bruised his groin 1
muscle on a hit at the end of the first ‘

half, he left his mark on Pitt fans
with an excellent move following a

square-out pattern that he turned

into a 15 yard gain.

Fortunately for the Panthers,
Clark will be ready for the Maryland
game.

“I’ll be back to practice in two or A

three days," he said. “It’s just sore,
no big deal.”

“[Maryland’s] going to be atough
game. They‘re a super football team.
I just want to get well and ready for
the Maryland Terps." »

With the addition of the newest
tandem to the long list of Pitt receiv-
ers one can say that their future is as
bright as those who came before
them. Injury should be the only hur-
dle for these two.
