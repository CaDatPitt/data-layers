Students appeal to state for sympathy

Chris Neverman I Visual Editor

Members of Pitt’s Student Government Board, along with an intern, have started a new initiative to spread student concern about Gov. Tom
‘ Corbett’s proposed $900 million cuts to education spending.

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff‘ Writer

The Student Government Board re-
vealed a new initiative yesterday to
bring students’ voices — and faces
— to Harrisburg. .

The Board is compiling a photo
project in anticipation of Pitt Day in
Harrisburg. As part of the project,
suidents write a short phrase on a
whiteboard about how cuts in edu-
cationfundingwill personally impact

 

 

 

them. So far, most phrases have been
short on content — typically shorter
than a 140-character Tweet —— and
big on demotion. U H
SGB hopes the phrases of protest
will gain the attention of Republican
Gov. Tom Corbett, who is callingfor a
$900 million cutin education ﬁmding
as a part of his-ﬁrst budget proposal.
Pitt ofﬁcials and some legislators
across the state have criticized the

budget, setting the stage for alengthy ‘

amendment and approval process.-
Pitt’s statefunding would be re-

 

duced by more than half as a part
of the budget, from $185 million to
$80.2 million. The budget, which ac-
counts foramult1'billion—dollarﬁ1nd—
ing shortfall without raising taxes or
fees,'still has to go through the state
legislature before enactment.

The deadline for the proposal to
become law isjune 30. _

This leaves students with a three-
month window of time to express
their views, since the cuts could po-
tentially‘ raise tuition and slash Uni-

versity programs.

SGB” member Emily Hoover said
her intern, sophomore communica-
tion major Madeline Beyer, came up
with’ the idea to have students take
a picture with a whiteboard after
hearing a suggestion to make‘ a “deb
yearbook.” , '

The yearbook project, ﬁrst pro-
posed by Pitt junior and Pem1PIRG
member Pat Szurkowski, would have
paired_picu'1res with student’s debt
levels to show legislators how much
more debtvarious students would be

in with the proposed Corbett cuts.

Chancellor
calls for
action on

budget

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staff Writer

When Gov. Tom Corbett announced

‘ plans earlier this month to slice the
University’s state appropriation in
half, some Pitt students had one
question in mind: What can they
do to help prevent the cuts?

Student Government Board
president Molly Stieber received
a number of e-mails asking that
same question, and she replied
with a uniform statement.

“We as the students need to
make our case,” she said.

So far, SGB and the Graduate
and Professional Student As-
sembly have worked together to
make that case and defend Pitt’s
stateappropriation. Their most
recent endeavor involves a letter-
writing campaign in the William
Pitt Union, which will run today
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The groups will supply paper,
stamps and envelopes for any
student who stops in the Lower
Lounge to write a letter asking
their representative to vote against
the budget cut.

“We have the supplies there for
students,” GSPA president Nila
Devanath said. “All we need is for
people to come.” 

Chancellor Mark’ Nordenberg
kicked off_the event during the
Student Advocacy Forum, where
he addressed about 120 students

Biden calls for increase incollege graduation rates D

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Vice President Joe Biden an-
nounced yesterday a plan that
would help the U.S. produce the
largest number of college gradu-
ates in the world —- in proportion
to its population — by the next
decade.

A White House news release
said the plan would rely on state
governors to host summits that fo-

cus on college completion. Biden,
who spoke at an education summit
yesterday, also released a college
completion tool kit and news of
a new grant competition. Theo-
retically, both would increase" the
United States’ global ranking in
college graduation rates.

For Biden to vault the U.S.
to No. 1 by 2020 —.-— it currently
sits in ninth place — the United
States would have to increase col-
lege graduation by 50 percent,
or an additional 8 million college

_ graduates throughout the next de-

cade. Korea currently leads the
world. _
“America once led the world in
the number of college graduates
it produces, and now we’ve fallen
to ninth,” said U.S. Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan, who
opened the summit on Monday
evening. “While our educational
advancement stalled, other coun-
tries have passed us by. We need
to educate our way to a better

economy, and governors must

help lead the way.
Part of the help the federal gov-
ernmént will give to the states is a

toolkit designed to aid governors ,

boost graduation rates. The kit in-
cludes a number of strategies that

address cost and implementation, '

as well as tips on how states can
use federal resources.

Some of the plans will align
high school exit and college place-
ment standards, dole out fund-
ing based on colleges’ success at

boosting completion rates and

,  L7 :
ease the process of transferring
between colleges.
“Right now we’ve got an edu-

cation system that works like a '

funnel when.-.we need it to work
like a pipeline,” Biden said. “We_
have to ‘make the same commit-

.ment to getting folks across the

graduation stage that we ‘did to
getting them into the registrar’s
ofﬁce. The dreams and skills of
our college graduates will pave the

H way to a bright economic future

SGB to present photos to lawmakers

Signs 4 1

PennPIRG is an organization that,
like SGB, advocates for student civic
causes.

So far, Beyer and Hoover have tak-
en about 20 pictures. The pair began
taking the photos yesterday during a
Student Advocacy Forum with Chan-
cellor Mark Nordenberg.

Some phrases had a humorous
tone, whereas others were more se-
rious. V

One student said, “Ifyou cut our
funding  I won’t be able to buy dry
erase markers.” Another said, “If you
cut our funding  my brother won’t
be able to join me next year on cam-
pus.”

Hooversaid the pictures and their

short catch phrases will add a per— ,

sonal touch to the issue, something
that is important when it comes to
inﬂuencinglegislators on tough policy
decisions.

“That is what’s really going to get
through [to lawmakers] ,” she said.
“That is what’s real, what’s going to
affect people.”

Beyer and Hooverbothbelieve the
initiative would work to get politics
on the minds of students and hope-

fully force them to think about how
the cuts could have lasting effects on
their lives.

Board members Alex Zimmerman
and Hoover emphasized how students
already seem aware that such dramat-
ic cuts in state funding would mean
more than just a rise in tuition.

Zimmerman said he was im-

pressed by how many students have ,

students not to fear if she suddenly
thrusts the whiteboard at them.

altered the original phrase to express
a more positive message.

The Board met brieﬂy last night
in Nordy’s Place, only hearing one
allocations request. The meeting
lasted less than half an hour, ad-
journing at 9:15 p.m.

The Allocations Committee
was in moratorium from March 4
to -March 21 to hold budget hear-
ings. ’

Budgets heard by the committee
were for the fall semester, or for the
2011-12 ﬁscal year.

Board president Molly Stie-

gafety

is no  

casual issue

ou’d think a college cam-

pus would be a relatively

easy place to find casual
sex.

But apparently students at
the University of Chicago need
a little help.

An undergraduate at the uni-
versity recently launched UChi-
cagoHookups.com —— a social
networking site that allows stu-
dents on campus to ﬁnd “casual
encounters.”

“The site is similar to the
‘Casual Encounters’ section of
Craigslist, but allows students
to scan fellow students — rath-
er than random people on the
Internet,” The Hufﬁngton Post
reported. V

And according to the website,
its owners are looking to expand
to other universities.

Unfortunately, this website
seems to provide the message
that because the site is only open
to students, it makes casual sex
safer. We think that casual sex
with other students is just as
potentially dangerous as hook-
ing up with strangers from the
Internet. Just because someone
has the same .edu e-mail pro-
vider as you doesn’t mean you
can trust them.

Avert.org —— an international
HIV and AIDS charity —— defines
casual sex as “a sexual activity
where those involved do not de-
ﬁne it as romantic or their part-
ner_ as boyfriend or girlfriend.”
Although this sounds tempting
in a college environment, it is
still important to protect your-
self by knowing your hook—up’s
sexual history. And when you
meet people on a website, they

might fail to tell you of any sexu-
ally transmitted diseases they
have. As always, when you sleep
with someone, you are sleeping
with everyone he or she has ever
slept with.

Because the website speciﬁ-
cally aims to help people ﬁnd
casual encounters, Chicago stu-
dents might be feeling the itch
instead of feeling the love. After
all, the more partners you have,
the more at-risk you are for HIV
and other diseases, according to
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention — even if you
use a condom.

In addition, something im-
portant to consider is that cam-
puses aren’t that big. If you use a
website to ﬁnd a “study buddy”
from your university, the chance
of you awkwardly bumping into
that person again is pretty high.
Casual gets a little more compli-
cated when contained in a small
campus environment. Sure that
one-night stand was fun + until
he or she ends up in your statis-
tics class next semester.

Ultimately, we think UChica—

. go’s website seems a little desper-

ate and lazy. People casually hook
up on college campuses all the
time without a socia1'network-
ing tool. But more importantly,
we’re worried about the health
consequences of promoting ran-
dom promiscuity. Who you hook

up with and how you ﬁnd them.

is, of course, your choice. But if
the website causes hook-ups on
campus to increase, the trans-
mission of sexual diseases will
likely also increase. Sex might
be casual sometimes, but your
safety shouldn’t be. I

Introducing Prisoniversitym

 
  
 

Oliver Baternan
Columnist

Pitt stands to lose billions of dollars
under Gov. Thomas “Tom” Corbett’s
proposed budget for ﬁscal year 2011-_
12, which is only $50 million less than
the totalvalue ofﬁreballingleft-handed
pitcher CC Sabatl1ia’s contract. Mean-
while,  for the prison system
and state police will remain close to
2010-11 levels. While most of you are
probably rushing to sign some online
petition or get all G-20 in the streets

- (that’s so 2000-and—late, by the way),

we’ve decided to put on our thinking
caps and devise a solutiontothe prob-
lemthatissuretopleaseeventheangri-
estold men.

While engaged in the hard—hitting
research forwhichwe’re so renowned,
we discovered thatthe Roman Catholic
writer G. K. Chesterton, who looked
like a cross between William Howard
Taft and Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt,
had arrived atananswer nearlya cen-
wry ago. In one of his short pieces, he
expressed concern about the swelling
population of the British penal system.
In “a society thatwill go on irnpr'ison—
ingfor no reason atall,” he remarked,
“it matters little whether our masters

stoopto statethe matfcerintheform
that every prison should be a school;

or in the more candid form that every p

school shouldbe aprison.”
What a remarkable idea! Giventhat
the education line item in the budget

is shrinking, why not just consolidate 3

expenses by combiningthe state-sup-
ported universities with the prisons?
Since the main campuses of Temple,
Pitt and Penn State can support acom-
bined 100,000 or so students, adding
the state’s 50,000 inmates to the mix
wouldn’t present much of a problem.
Let’s startwithhousingandﬁnancial
aid: Imaginethewindfallthattheuniver-
sities could reap ifthey receivedashare
ofthe roughly$18,000to $31,000that
it coststo ahouse aprisonerfor ayear.
With this ldnd of money, Pitt mightbe
able to construct an adequate supply
ofhousing options for upperclassmen.
These hardened criminals are guaran-

teedmoneymakers, and you wouldn’t i

even need counselors tohelp them ap-
plyforst1rdent1oans.Infact, otherthan
the restitution he might have to pay as
a condition ofhis sentence, a prisoner
would be likely to leave the Prisoniver—

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Sensationalize this: Nuclear fears overblown

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

When you choose to read a news-
paper column, are you more likely
to read one that says “the press has
held a great deal of importance and
blah blah blah”? Or would you rather
read something that opened, “We’re
all going to die,‘ and it’s all the media’s
faultl”?

Nobody understood how popular

and inﬂuential controversy could be .
betterthanW1lliam Randolph Hearst.

The infamous 19th century newspaper
publisher usedhis position to ﬁirther
his hope of awar between the United
States and Spain, famously cablingthe
sentence “you furnish the pictures,
and I’ll.furnish the war.” Whether or
not we would have gone to war with
Spainwithoutthe frenzied exhortation
of the sensationalist “yellow press” is
anopen question-. But onethingis sure
-— Hearst and others certainly helped
to unite public opinion in favor of the
Spanish—American War. I

We oftenliketo thinkof ourselves
as more enlightened and less foolish
than those of the Victorian era, espe-
cially those who got excited without

being in full possession of the facts.

We also like to think that our press has
evolved and never fans the ﬂames of
hysteria. Yet as the press coverage and
public reaction to the crisis at the Fu-
kushima Daiichi nuclear plant injapan
demonstrates, both of these senses of
superiority are misplaced.

Elements of the press have be-

. haved irresponsibly in their cover-

age of the nuclear crisis, making the
situation appear more dire than it
actually is. Instead of looking for the
entire story, both Chinese and U.S.

citizenshavepanickedaboutathreat ‘

of radiation that is not imminent in
either of their countries, and some
are taking measures that might end
up being harmful to their health.

, First, consider the media overre-
action. ANewYork Times headline on
March 16 screamed,"‘Last Defense at
Troubled Reactors: 50_]apanese Work-
ers,” andaWall Streetjournal headline
the following day was “U.S. Sounds
Alarm on Radiation,” with the story
suggesting that the U.S. was deeply
concerned about levels of radiation in

A Japan and quotingtheEUenergy chief

as saying the Fukushima Daiichi site
was “effectively out of control.” The
New York Times on March 17 even
went so far as to quote an urmamed
source who said of the efforts to cool

the spent ﬁiel rods in the plant that
“[w] hat you are seeing are desperate
efforts — just throwing everything at
it in hopes somethingwill work.” The
U.S. Surgeon General also rather dop-
ily said that buying potassium iodide
in the U.S. was not a bad idea.
And then there was that inevi-
table slew of ‘articles in the paper
about Chernobyl that ran next to the
Japan stories. While the middle of
the average article might tell us that
the odds of Chernobyl II is roughly
zero, the constant comparison be-
tween the current serious situation
and the catastrophically bad one in
Ukrainein1986 makesanimpression
on people.
, Yes, the overall situation injapan
— when taking the aftermath of the

earthquake and tsunami into account ’

— amounts to a serious humanitar-
ian crisis, but the nuclear incident
should not overinflate well-deserved
concern. '

_In fact, The International Atomic
Energy Agency updates since March
18 have indicated thatthe situationhas
not changed substantially, thatTokyo
was notunder any sort ofthreatfrom
radiation, Godzillawas not anywhere
in the picture and so forth. The IAEA
also noted that the isotope of most

concern, radioactive iodine, has ahalf—
life of 8 days, meaning that although
potential radioisotope contamination
is bad now, in a few short months it
won’t be. In short, the IAEA said that
while the situation was and remains
serious, it shouldn’t be cause forwide—
spread panic. Heck, if you bothered to
read The New York Times article that
quoted the unnamed source carefully
enough, it also seems like that 19-mile
exclusion zone the Japanese govern-
ment put into place was just about
right, and the U.S. 50-mile exclusion
zone was merely an additional precau-
tion on our part. .

The public reaction to scary head-
lineswas avery human one: Needless
panic. Chinese citizens rushed out to
buy bags of salt, hearing that the io-
dine in them could protect against
possible thyroid damage. It doesn’t,
unless of course youﬁndthe righttype ~
of iodized salt and consume heap-
fuls. What protects against thyroid
damage is potassium iodide, which
U.S. consumers were demanding in
large quantity despite the facts that
Hawaii is 3,800 miles away from the
reactor site, the West Coast is nearly
5,000, and President Barack Obama
and other oﬂicials were urging people
not to worry. There is zero cause for

alarm from U.S. citizens. And yet, we
are alarmed.

An atmosphere of widespread
alarmcan cause serious harm. For one
thing, those iodine tablets shouldn’t
be taken for kicks, as scientiﬁc lit-
erature indicates that they can cause
problems for people with allergies or
thyroid conditions. When U.S. con-
sumers buy potassium iodide, this
also means less is available for people
who might actually need it. Beyond
this immediate impact, the alarm over
the Fukushima reactor is going to col-
or the debate we are no doubt goingto
have about the future of nuclear power
in this counny. Though this is a debate
worth having, it cannotbe conducted
rationally in an atmosphere of wide-
spread terror and incomplete com-
prehension. During this debate we
will have to ask ourselves whether the
beneﬁts of nuclear powerareworth its
risks. We cannot come up with a rea-
sonable answer to this question if the
risks are not represented accurately
or well understood. The press has a
great responsibility to convey events
accurately and not succumb to the
siren song of sensationalism.

From outside, the now-deﬁmctYMCA
inEastLibertylookslikeanotherpiece
of empty real estate. But behind its
grimy facade, avery ldnetic spectacle
takes shape.

Afterenteringtheunmarkedbuild
ing from Whitﬁeld Street, crossing a
gloomy foyer and ascendingstairsthat
go past a low-lit, dust—caked gymna-
sium, one is suddenly in anArgentin-
ian speakeasy.

This is the set of Quantum The-
atre’s latest show, a production of Ar-
gentinian composer./'\stor Piazzolla’s
1968 tango-opera, “lvlaria De Buenos
Aires.”

Quantum is staging the piece in
collaboration with Attack Theatre
and a number of local artists. Open-
ing night is Friday.

Karla Boos, Quantum’s artistic
director and the stage director of
“Maria,” said the show “takes the au-
dience onanamazingjoumeythrough
the evolution of the tango as an art
form.” ‘ '

And that is what the show adds
up to ﬁguratively. Narratively, it is the
story ofMaria, played by Argentinian
mezzo-soprano Raquel Winnica. Wm-
nica’s character dances and sings her
way through the phases of her life,

‘ from the suburbs of Buenos Aires

where she is raised by immigrant
parents, to the city’s brothels, where
Boos said “she is degraded, dies a hor-
rible death and is reborn.”

Boos stressed that Maria personi-
ﬁes the tango: its multiethnic roots, its
sensuality and its liberatingpotential.
These aspects, more than the play’s
narrative, are the attractions of the
show.

“The plot itself is an ephemeral
kind of thing. You have to embrace this
very wild, hallucinogenic poetry and

just let yourself be immersed in the
experience of it,” Boos added.

Michele de la Reza, co—director of
Attack Theatre as well as a choreogra-
pher and adancer for “Maria,” talked
about immersion aswell, emphasizing
the unconventional set as an integral
part of creatingthe stimulating experi-
ence that the cast and crew aim for.

“It’s far from your traditional
dance space. There’s so much that
we’re choreographing on 4—foot wide
platforms, small ovals —— even ramps.
One of our goals was to build this set

for this space rather than imposing '
it, so we asked ourselves what the ‘
oddities of the space offer us,” dela

Reza said.

Tony Ferrieri, the show’s set de-
signer, recognized right away that a
conventional proscenium stagewould
not suit the show, so he has construct-
ed platforms that cross the space at
odd angles, dividingthe audience into

small groupsthatexperiencethe danc- .

ing from many vantage points. Each
of these groups will sit at candle—lit
cabaret tables draped in black fabric,
completing the bar atmosphere. V
“Because the play is about this
nonlinear journey, that inspired
the conﬁguration of the set, with its
zigzagging platforming. The larger,
round platforms represent key mo-

MUSIC COLUMN

Some musicians moreinterested in music than money

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

   
 
 

The history of music is littered
with the word “free.” Free Jazz.
“I’m Free” by those dastardly Roll-
ing Stones. Even concerts for a free
Tibet. But when it comes to getting
(recorded) music for free, that his-
tory’s been a little shorter.

The Clash supposedly took a
loss on some album royalties to
provide the second-half of the
band’s double album London Call-
ing and the second two-thirds of its
triple—album Sandinista! at lower

prices than the record company
wanted, believing that its songs
were more important than the
cash that could be made on their
revenue.

Today in the post—Napster
world, free music is everywhere.
Some choose to use torrents and
music blogs to obtain ill-gotten
albums, but meanwhile, another
culture has emerged to unite mu-
sic-lovers and music-makers.

Mixtapes go back as far as hip-
hop, showcasing club performanc-
es of early Djs like Grandmaster
Flash and Afrika Bambaataa. De-
veloped for promotional reasons,

these (usually) free albums have
become some of the best music
sources around.

Das Racist, a multi-ethnic'hip-
hop troop from Queens ‘made of
MCs Heems and K001 A.D. — and
joined live by hype man Dap —— pro-
vides one of those great sources.

They dropped their debut single
“Combination Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell” back in 2008, but it wasn’t
until they released the mixtape
Shut Up, Dude that people realized
these seriously clever rappers were
the next great thing in hip-hop.

sequel Sit Down, Man at dasracist.

William Fitzsimmons, the bearded and whispery folk singer, recently released his new
album Gold In The Shadow. He will play in Pittsburgh on April 5 at Brillobox.

He wrote his third CD as an apology to
his ex-wife. Oh, and he sports a bald and
bearded look that rivals that of Shel Sil-

His most recent album Gold In The

MUSIC REVIEW

Free iTunes songs p
absolutely Worth the price

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

On-the Internet, free music is ubiquitous.
On iTunes, however, even singles that
bands have released at no cost -—- most
recently, Fleet Foxes’ “Helplessness Blues”
and the Tune—Yards’ “Bizness” — often
warrant a 99—cent price tag.

Given this stinginess, I suspected

theynewest free songs on Apple’s music
store were, insome fashion,wo‘rthless -
wretched, lifeless deformities of music.
After downloading three of the tracks,
however, I’m happy to ‘report this is only
somewhat true. ‘ I

Below, I’ve critiqued three songs Apple
has donated to listeners out of the good-
ness of its heart.

From the moment “Who’s that?
Brooown!” starts up, you can tell
the opener is going to be some-
thing different. Over an exagger-
ated sample of the title line being
sung, Kool A.D. calmly raps‘ that
“Brown Elvis I can’t help it, Brown
Larry Bird on the 97 Celtics.”

The chaos continues on “You

_ Oughta Know” which samples Billy

]oel’s “Movin’ Out,” combining that
track’s funky beat with a power-
ful drum kit to make it one of the
best music samples from 2010. “I
get around like a vinyl/ All sales
ﬁnal, Lionel Richie/I’m so gang~
sta prissy” they rap, effortlessly
moving heavy references through

their words.

Das Racist’s “Ek Shaneesh” was
featured on Anthony Bourdain’s
Holiday Special because of the fa-
mous chef they name check, but it
features more than a shout out to
the “No Reservations” star over a
light Indian beat. Koo1A.D.- begins,

The band Gorillaz has also released a free album in the last year. The

I before handing it off to Heems on

the line “probably drinking some
more beers.” Heems references

Edward Said and provides a few-

words of Spanish before the track
is over. ‘

It isn’t just hip—hop culture get-
ting in on the free release band-
wagon, though.

Fans of Radiohead will remem-
ber that back in 2007, the group
released its album I n Ramlaazw for

free, allowing fans to set the price ‘

they wished to pay for their cre-
ative work. Thafsite is now down,
but just this past year, one of Ra-

diohead’s English contemporaries '

Gorillaz released a free album, ti-

tled The Fall, that musical director.

Damon Albarn composed on the
band’s North American Tour.
(You can stream it for free here:
thefall.gorillaz.com.) I
From “Phoner to Arizona” to
“Seattle Yodel” and back, Albarn’s
musically cerebral mind created

tracks that highlight the sonic
versatility of the guy who started

. as the singer for Blur. Electronics
' are everywhere, but informed by

everything from world music to
the American road trip, the album
inspired. It was composed on an
iPad, but you’d never guess it by
listening.

Perhaps the greatest meeting
place for those interested in free

music who don’t want it to put ,

them behind bars is DatPiff. Fea-

turing more mixtapes than you‘

could listen to in a lifetime, the
site offers a perspective on almost
any subgenre in free downloads,
from A to Z. Some are fan—created,
but most are artist-sponsored and
sound as professional as any CD
you could pick up. If you haven’t
already checked out a classic by
Mac Miller or Jay Electronica, do
so ASAP.

(Browse some mixtapes at wvvw.
datpifﬁcom.)

Music is never truly a free thing:
It’s ‘a promotion or a statement or
a thank you. Amid the convoluted
messages though, there’s some-
thing great to listen to. Q5‘.

Boos added that the intersecting platforms
are “an approximation of the winding streets of
Buenos Aires.”

In addition to moving through space, the
showcharts awindingcourse throughthe history

the Argentinian milonga through jazz inﬂuences
through French classical inﬂuences.”

Michele de la Reza:

Allof this cultural mixingisﬁrstand foremost
the work ofPiazzolla, whose compositionwillbe
broughtto life by Music DirectorAndres Cladera
and an ensemble of eight musicians, including
bandoneénists and string players.

But forall of its borrowings, the cast and crew
maintain that “Maria” is a quintessentially Ar-
gentinian work, hence their decision to keep the
lyrics entirely in Spanish.

Inner turmoil inspires songs

Fitzsimmons 1 12

sometimes emotionally devastating lyr-
ics throughout the album. Fitzsimmons’
has said this latest release was much in-
spired by personal turmoil, and that comes
through in the melancholy singing.

Perhaps one of the most striking songs
‘is “Psychasthenia.” The title is the name
of a disorder characterized by irrational
compulsions and phobias. It’s ﬁtting, as the
musician claims inspiration from speciﬁc
disorders in the “Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders" IV” —- the
psychiatric handbook. ’ _ T .

Starting with a pattering of percussion
that continues as a steady foundation for
the song, an electric guitar echoes dis-
tantly, occasionally strumming wavering,
distorted notes. ,

In juxtaposition to the repetitive and
calculated music is Fitzsimmons’ tender
vocals, harmonized by airy female singing.
“Cut me open, please,” they cry together in

’ a heartbreaking chorus.

Immediately afterward, the album
moves into “Bird of Winter Prey,” which
showcases Fitzsimmon’s ability to stack
components and build a song. Starting with
traditional folksy guitars, the music moves
to incorporate asweeping string section
as the song builds with the singer’s voice

remaining steadfast and calm.
Much like Sufjan Stevens, Fitzsimmons

rarely pushes or -raises his vocals above

asoothing whisper. But in the song “Let
You Break,” he features Julia Stone, who
adds some vocal dramatics to complement
Fitzsimmon’s lullaby sound. Her slightly
raspy voice has a more varied range and
adds spice to a song that would be lacking
without her. ‘ . 5

; The two go back and forth in snfeetly

conversational style reminiscent of The A
Weepies throughout the simplistic tune. _

It’s apparent that without Stone’s addi-
tions, the somewhat monotonous guitars
and ﬂute would drag -quit'e a bit. ‘A
There are some songs that require trudg-
ingtthroughilateriion the. record. “Ti‘eid;To

Me,” for .exaniple,' is‘vTer7y slow,‘ starting

withameandering guitar that doesn’t do
enough to aid Fitzsimmons’ singing. Even
when the banjo and ﬂute start, it seems as
though they’re going in slow motion, wait-
ing for a build-up'_that isn’t quite enough
to warrant the pace.

Despite a few snags, the album is calm
and pleasant. Itis perhapsbest suited for a
prolonged winter rather than spring.

Third song a change of
pace in free music section

iTunes < 12

  

Bands Art of Dying-nd Straight Line Stitc, whose sons eature ius’ fe

 

song section, both have album covers featuring crows.

Artist: Art of Dying
Album: Vices and Virtues

’ When it comes to music, Vancouver -

by any measure, one of the nicest cities 4

in North ‘America — is not without its
abominations (see: Nickelback). Unfortu-
nately, Canadian quintet Art of Dying only
furthers the disservice to its hometown.
In fact, Art of Dying’s new single, “Die
Trying,” is about as intelligent as a Nickel-
back B-side. After a protracted drum solo,
the track ignites intoa racket of distor-
tion and canned machismo, punctuated

by the chorus: “If it takes forever / I will '

die trying.” Not only is this declaration
a tiresome conﬂation of clichés, it’s also
incredibly ambiguous: Is lead singerjonny

' Hetherington’s death contingent on the
interminability of his task, or is he merely

A expressing an unfailing dedication‘? In any
case, the nature of his pursuit remains
unclear: At best, listeners might infer that
there is something very difficult Hether-
ington is attempting to accomplish, and
he’s not doing a very good job.

Tellingly, the ﬁrst lines in “Die Trying”
are, “I think it’s time for me to go now
/ I’ve done more harm than good.” Just
this once,’I wish Art of ._Dying trusted its
intuition."

“Conversion”
Artist: Straight Line Stitch
Album: The Fight of Our Lives

In several respects, “Conversion” serves
as a natural companion to “Die Trying:”
Both songs feature a riot of distortion, an
obliquely referenced quest and a monoto-
nous chorus. - -

Nevertheless,“Conversion” is at least
marginally more admirable. The front-
woman’s singing —— often screaming —— is

impassioned, rather than tossed off. The

2

interplay between hysterical verses and a
more measured chorus is sensible, if noth-

-ing else."And the band is able to produce an
intriguing guitar effect akin to the bursts .

of a semi-automatic gun.

This isn’t to say “Conversion” is a good
track — in fact, it’s quite mediocre. But
when perusing the current bank of iTunes
free singles, listeners with a thirst for met-
al and an absence of 99 cents would do well
to select “Conversion” (the one with a crow
looking upward) over “Die Trying” (the
one with a crow looking downward).

“Te Voy a Amar”
Artist: El Trono de Mexico
Album: Sigo Estando Contigo

_The musical disparity between “Te Voy
a Amar” and the previously mentioned free
singles is so pronouncedas to seem a prac-
tical joke on iTunes’ part. Indeed, “Amar”

~—— whose album art ‘depicts a collection of
-dapper Hispanic men gazing alluringly at

something off screen —— seems designed
specifically to thwart any adrenaline-fu-
eled hysteria induced by “Conversion” and
“Die Trying.”

. Thankfully, it succeeds. Like the pre-
ceding singles, “Te Voy a Amar” is unre-
markable —— but in a comforting, rather
than grating, sort of way. After a plaintive
piano introduction, the track eases into
a synth and accordion groove, overlaid
with the earnest vocals so integral to Latin
American music. - I

As for the lyrics, I’m not qualified to
pass judgment: I only received a 2 on my
AP Spanish exam. In any“ case, my guess
is that “Amar” isn’t grounded in intricate
wordplay —— rather, it’s meant to serve
as ‘a wistful, easily digestible ballad, with
the power to dispel the misfortunes — or
inept metal bands —— that may have fouled
a listener’s day.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

Despite the Panthers’ early exit
from the NCAA Tournament, Pitt
men’s basketball head coach Ja-
mie Dixon earned one of college
basketball’s top honors when
he was named Sporting News
Magazine’s Coach of the Year on
Tuesday. v
, Dixon is the second coach
in the history of Pitt’s pro-

gram to win the Coach of the J

Year award from Sporting
News. The other was Ben How-
land, who merited the distinc-
tion in the 2001-02 season.

Dixon, who led the Panthers
to a 28-6 record on the year and
a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tour-

nament, is a four-time National

Coach of the Year honoree. This

season, the Panthers set a new.

program best with a 15-3 league
record on their way to an outright
Big East regular season champi-

onship.

Additionally, in all eight
seasons as head coach for the
Panthers, Dixon has amassed
at least 20 wins and 10 Big
East victories every year.

Earlier in the year, with a 66-50
win over USF on March 2, Dix-
on also became the winningest
coach in NCAA Division I history
through eight seasons. He now
has 216 victories in his ﬁrst eight
seasons as a head coach, beating
out Mark Few of Gonzaga and
Roy Williams of Kansas, both who
had 213 wins in eigh—t seasons.

_ As the 2010-11 season con-
cluded, Dixon was also the coach
with the highest win percentage
in Big East history, at .708.

Following Dixon on that list
are a few legendary coaches such

as Georgetown’sJohn Thompson C

(.653), Syracuse’s Jim Boeheim
(.643), Connecticut’s Jim Cal-

houn (.641) and St. John’s Lou

Carnesecca (.635). J

WRESTLING

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team concluded its

stellar season with a disappointing‘

ﬁnish at the NCAA Championships in
’ Philadelphia over the weekend.

The Panthers, with eight national
qualiﬁers —— the most in Pitt history
since the 1950s —- were unable to
ﬁnish with an NCAA All-American
in a season that saw them win their
conference regular season and tour-

‘nament championship.

“I think obviously we came back
disappointed,” assistant coachjason
Peters said of the team’s 34th place
ﬁnish amongst the 73 teams. “We
wanted to have some All-Americans.

. J, With all the time that has gone into

this year, we didn’t get the results
that we wanted. If I said that we were

fall short at NCAA Championships  

anything more than disappointed,
I’d be lying. We think so highly of
our guys that we expected to have
better results.” A A

The Panthers won their ﬁrst bout
at 125 pounds when sophomore An-
thony Zanetta defeated No. 10 Alan
Waters of Missouri by a7-2 score. Za-

nettawas pinned in his second bout P

by No. 7 Ryan Mango of Stanford
before being eliminated on a loss to
Sean Boyle of Michigan.

At 141 pounds, redshirt junior
and returning All—American Tyler
Nauman wonhisﬁrst bout of the day
overJosh Kindig of Oklahoma State.
In the second round, Nauman lost
by decision to N0. 10 ranked Todd
Schavrien of Missouri. Nauman,
ranked No. 7, was then eliminated
after falling to Stephen Dutton of
Lehigh in the consolation round.

FOOTBALL

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

When head football coach Todd Graham
arrived at Pitt, he promised that a high-
octane and explosive offense would take
overﬁat Heinz Field this season.

. One of the keys to installing that fast-
paceid philosophy is Mike Norvell — Pitt’s
newfco-offensive coordinator, Wide receiv-
erscgoach and director of recruiting.-

Norvell, a Texas native who worked
with Graham at Tulsa for the past four
yeargs, helped, guide an offense at Tulsa

“We want to dictate the game with an
explosive, high-powered tempo,” hesaid
at’Pitt’s signing day news conference last
imonyith. “Wewant to take shots vertically

down the ﬁeld. We want to threaten the _

. defense horizontally and vertically. It’s an

offense unlike any other in the country.”
Graham agreed, adding that he would

_ describe the philosophy as blue—collar

and hard—edge.

' “We’re not a no-huddle offense, we’re
a. no -huddle football team,” Graham said.
“We go fast and we go efficient ... we do it
in a very physical manner.”

a During the 2010 season at Tulsa,
Norvell served as the passing game Co?
ordinator, receivers coach and director
of recruiting for the Golden Hurricane.
The team produced ﬁve 1,o0o—yard re-
ceivers, including All—American Damaris
Johnson. , ;;  

To suecessfully install this offense,
Norvell said the coaches look for players
who can runat the same speed with or
without pads. ,

- ‘5We’re looking for guys, offensively and
defensively, that are a level faster than
their opponents,” he said. “That’s what I
think we got with this [2011] class.”

He added that the coaches are excited
about the current group of Pitt players
as Well, believing they have the skill and

Norvell to lead offense, receivers and recruiting

speed to execute the offense.
“I’ve had receivers come to see me, and
they’re smiling from ear to ear,” Norvell

said. “We are so excited about the group we —

have now to be able to bring the offense in
and utilize their skills and talents.”

One of those players is redshirt sopho-
more wide receiver Devin Street, who said
he’s been excited since he ﬁrst watched
Graham’s offense and Tulsa’s game ﬁlm
when the new staff was announced.

“Now we’re ﬁnally out there just playing
and having fun,” he said after practice on

Tuesday. “It’s just a joy to be out there.”

Street said the biggest adjustment is
to the offense’s pace.

“Coming in, we knew it was going to be‘ '

up-tempo, but it’s‘like an insanity tempo,”
he said. “It’s a great thing because teams
are not going to be ready for it.” _

He added that he loves working with
Norvell, who he described as an enthusi-
astic coach.

“His energy level is through the roof,”
Street said. “Just in the fo_ur days [of prac-
tice] he’s made me a better wide receiver
than I was last year already.”

TI-/IROVVINQ A KIRSCHBALL

Root for BYU, Arizona in NCAA Tournament

With the Panthers eliminated from the NCAA Tournament, Lauren Kirschman lists teams Pitt fans can now support

V MCT Campus
Pittsburgh native and Pitt alumnus Sean_Miller leads No. 5—seed Arizona into the Sweet
‘ - ‘16 to take on No. 1 seed Duke.

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

With the Pitt men’s basketball team get-
ting prematurely knocked out of the NCAA
Tournament last weekend,ma_ny Panther
fans are avoiding any mention of college
basketball. But for those who are going

‘ to continue to watch the madness unfold,

there are still teams and players worth
pulling for.

Which members of the Sweet 16 could
Pitt enthusiasts latch onto for the remain-
der of March? My ﬁrst choice is BYU. —
mainly because Jimmer Fredette is awe-
some. He’s the nation’s leading scorer,
hisname sounds like it came from the

classic basketball movie “Hoosiers” and -

his 3-point shooting range doesn’t have
a limit.

a 'He’s the most entertaining player left
in the tournament, and the bigger plus is

that he’s not only talented but completely

humble and likable as well. It’s a combina-

- tion that doesn’t come around very often at
any level of athletics, so college basketball
fans should enjoy Fredette while he’s still
around. And they should want him to con-
tinue playing for as long as possible.

Pitt fans should also consider pulling
for the Big East teams still left in the tour-
nament —- Marquette and UConn. Why?
Because they’re the only two conference
representatives remaining in the bracket,
so they’re the only teams capable of saving
the Big East’s stellar reputation.

The conference started with a record
11 teams in thetournament, but only two
made it to the Sweet 16. That statistic has
fans and experts alike accusing the Big
East of being overrated. For the sake of
salvaging the conference’s image —— the
conference that ‘Pitt won outright this
season — Marquette and UConn need to
advance.

If you’re really into Pitt loyalty, Arizona

PSU wins wrestling  

team title

Wrestling 4 16

Redshirt freshman Dane Johnson made
his ﬁrst trip to the NCAA Championships.» At
149 pounds,_]ohnson fell in consecutive bouts
to the eventual 3rd and 6th place ﬁnishers,
including an overtime loss to Andrew Nadhir
of Northwestern.

At 157 pounds, redshirt sophomore Donnie
Tasser won a bout in the consolations over
Matt Cathell of Kent State before being elirni—
nated. " ‘

“Itwas a positive thing having guys like Dane '

Johnson, Donnie Tasser and Max Thomusseit
make it to their ﬁrst nationals,” Peters said.
“These young guys stepped up and made it to
the next level.” -
Freshman Max Thomusseit won his first
bout in his‘ ﬁrst trip to the NCAA Champion-
ships. Thomusseit defeated Erich Schmidtke
of Oklahoma to open the tournament. His run
ended when he_dropped a tight 6-5 decision to
Matt Ryan of West Virginia.
Also at 184 pounds, Eastern Wrestling
League foe Chris Honeycutt lost his ﬁrst bout

‘ of the season. Honeycutt had been the No.

1—ranked wrestler for much of the season. Hon-
eycutt fell to Quentin Wright of Penn State, the
eventual national champion. Wright defeated
fellow Pennsylvania grappler Robert Hamlin
of Lehigh for the title.

At 197 pounds, junior Zac Thomusseitwon
two consecutive bouts in the ﬁrst two rounds
of the tournament. Thomusseit, entering as
the No. 7-ranked wrestler, defeated both Matt
Casperson of Boise State and No. 10 Logan
Brown of Purdue. Thomusseit fell to the even-
tual national runner—up Clayton Foster of Okla-
homa State in the quarterﬁnals. Thomusseit

. was eliminated on a 2-0 defeat to Sonny Yohn

of Minnesota.

“I think overall for Zac you have to see his
tournament as somewhat of a success,” Peters
said. “I know his goal was a National Cham-
pionship, but for a guy to sit out most of _the
season and come in and make it to one match
short of placing,Jit’s kind of good considering
the circumstances.” V ‘

Redshirt senior heavyweight Ryan Tomei
lost his opening bout to Brendan Barlow of
Kent State, as Tomei could not outlast Barlow in
overtime. In the consolations, the No. 6-ranked
Tomei won two bouts before being eliminated
on a 10-3 loss to Tony Nelson‘ of Minnesota.

“I think that it’s really challenging some-
times for seniors,” Peters said. “The moment
grasped Ryan, and he didn’t put himself in
great positions. I feel bad for the guy, I know
he put the effort ingjust sometimes the outcome
doesn’t match the wor .”

“But you know great things come from

3 failure. Ryan will have the opportunity to go on_

and compete again if that’s what he chooses,”
Peters said. “And if he doesn’t, he can have a
successful life without wrestling.”

The tournament was dominated by Pennsyl-
vania wrestlers, as Penn State won the team title

for the ﬁrst time since 1953, with Cornell and
Iowa both trailing by more than 20 points.

“I think that it deﬁnitely says something
about Pennsylvania wrestling,” Peters said.
“Our program is getting better. You see the
same thing at Penn State and the other state
schools. This state has the most All-Americans,
and I think it will keep going that way as long
as we’re all improving.” ‘

One of the most sports—embodying mo-
ments to see at the tournament was Arizo-
na State’s Anthony Robles dominating the
125-pound weight class on his way to a National
Championship. Robles’ 36-0 record this season
stands apart from that ofhis competitors, espe-
cially because he only has one leg and doesn’t
use a prosthetic. That’s right, Robles was born
without his right leg. But at least 36 opponents
would probably agree that does not hold back
Robles on the mat.

Although the Panthers squad might have
fallen short of its goal of a top—10 ﬁnish, their
regular season accomplishments speak loudly.
. This season, the Panthers won their second

consecutive EWL team title as well as the EWL '

individual tournament. The Panthers have not
lost a conference match in the past two sea-
sons.

“I think all of the guys wanted more,” Peters

V said. “Seeing the adversity can help them. I

think that the bitter taste will be the fuel go-
ing forwar .”

“When you qualify for the NCAA Wrestling
Championships, you’re amongst the top 33
grapplers in the nation,” Pitt spokesman Jon
Brennan wrote fromamat-side seat at NCAA’s.
“Simply getting here is an amazing accomplish-
ment within itself. With that being said, no
matter how you fare at this tournament, you
should  out with your head held high.”

Tomei departs the program after battling

’ hard in every bout. He graduates with 109 wins

in his career, including 40 falls, good enough
for second all—tirne in Panthers history.

Another thing to‘ look ahead to for the
Panthers is the return of Matt Wilps. Wilps
redshirted this past season after winning the
197-pound weight class in the EWL in 2010.
Look for Wilps or the olderThomusseit to add
on a few pounds to wrestle at heavyweight
next season.

With the return of Wilps, the Panthers
will have eight returning national qualiﬁers.
Wilps traveled to the NCAA Championships
in 2010. »

“You know we don’t have another heavy-
weight on the roster,” head coach Rande Sto-
ttlemyer said several weeks ago. “With Matt
Wilps coming off his redshirt and with both
of the Thomusseit brothers, we have to ﬁnd a
place for all of these guys to wrestle. We’ll see
how it plays out going into the future.”

matchup with Kansas. .

An argument could be made to pull for

the country. But nobody likes to root for
the favorite. It’s much more fun to pull for
the underdog.

Virginia Tech were more deserving.

see Butler suffer or to know that Pitt got
beat by a team that continued to win, at
least the Bulldogs offer another reason to
stay invested. ‘ »

Besides the NCAA deciding to reverse
the score of Pitt’s ﬁnal game, ﬁnding an-
other way to stay interested in March is

us going 20 yards and not 19-and—a-half.
I just think he’s a great coach.”

As director of recruiting, Norvell was
put to the test early, as he was forced to
assemble a recruiting class under tough
circumstances. '

Because Graham wasn’t hired until '
