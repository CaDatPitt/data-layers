Proposed Po. House Bill Students Allege Police Assault
Could Hike Med Tuition

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Tuition hikes, and admissions,
faculty, and research cutbacks
could result at Pitt’s Medical

School if a proposed bill before the

State House Appropriations
Committee ever passes a floor vote,
the school's dean, Donald N.
Medearis, said.

The proposed bill is to encourage
Pennsylvania medical school grad-
uates to remain in state to practice.

It roughly parallels a measure of
Senator Patrick Stapleton which
would force medical graduates,
who practice out of state, to repay
state monies‘ allotted for their
schooling.

Congressman William Shane of
Indiana, one of 47 co-sponsors of
the bipartisan proposed bill, cited
the extensive Commonwealth
investment in medical education as
a factor in consideration of the
proposed bill.

Economic

BY MICHAEL CLINTON
Fear of a possible 1974 economic
recession and depression was
expressed by several top adminis-
trators and economic advisors
across the country this past week.
All the spokesmen agreed that
unless the Arab states lift their oil
embargo by next spring, and
unless the American people take
the proper measures for conserving
fuel, the US could suffer a serious
economic setback.
In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Herbert Stein, chairman of the
President’s Council of Economic

Advisors said, “The energy crisis .

will push the nation’s economy
down to near-recession levels next
year and force the unemployment
rate up to nearly 6 percent.

_ “If the jobless rate does rise to the

almost 6 percent level forecast from
the present 4.5 percent, more than
a million workers will lose their
jobs." Stein said.

He added that the economy's
growth next year as measured by
the Gross National Product (GNP)
market value of the nation’s goods
and services, could be only 1
percent. The normal growth rate is
4 percent.

Stein stressed that to avoid such
conditions, the Arabs must not only
lift the embargo, but President
Nixon’s energy-saving programs
must be efective.

According to authorities in Wash-
ington. Nixon's energy group is
continuing to study the effective-
ness of still further measures to

Medical interests are being
consulted in the development of the
legislation, Shane said. Both he
and Medearis agree the bill is an
important step in public health for
the state.

The major point of contention is
the funding of a program sug-
gested by the proposed bill, which
provides for residency training in
dispersed communities throughout,
the state. “I think there might be a
subsidy increase to implement this
sort of thing,” Shane said.

Medearis said such assurances

should be written into the bill. He
warned thattthe measure, as it
stands, would be disastrous. ‘
' ‘‘If additional money is not
supplied, it is impossible. If it
should pass we would have to
increase tuition, cut down on
student numbers and cut back on
faculty and research."

The alleged assault of two black
students by campus police, which
ofﬁcers say resulted when the
students resisted arrest in Tower C
early Saturday morning,
spurred student demands for an
investigation into charges of
University police brutality.

The appeals were made by Bill
Kilson,
Action Society (BAS), at a mass
student meeting Saturday night in
Tower B lobby. The‘ police have
declined comment on either the
incident or the meeting, preferring
to wait until the students’ hearing
December 10 in Criminal Court.

Kilson acknowledged the main
purpose in organizing the assembly
was to inform the campus
community of the recent allega-
tions involving possible police
mistreatment of black residents
and visitors.

“We began to see a pattern in
the way the campus police have
been handling black students,”
Kilson said. “We have a

conserve‘ fuel. As of this weekend,
the group is trying to reach a
decision on the necessity of a
gasoline tax or rationing.

Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), chair-
the Senate's .HEnergy
Subcommittee of the Interior and
Insular Affairs Committee, was
more pessimistic about the
economic situation of 1974.

“This is potentially the greatest
economic crisis since the Great
Depression of the 1930’s, ” he
said.

Jackson said there could be a $100
billion drop in the GNP for
l974,and that a system of priorities
must be established ‘to decide
immediately which industrieswill
have priority in the allocation of
fuel.

Norman Robertson, chief econo-
mist for Mellon Bank agreed, in a
revision of the bank's outlook for
1974, that a serious recession could
hit the US next year.

Robertson “assumes" the oil

‘embargo will be lifted in three or

four months. But he said if it isn't
and energy-saving methods fail,
next year's business climate could

. be complicated by supply shortages

creating layoffs and worker pess-
imism further cutting back people's
desire to buy." “And ‘then it will
be awfully hard to avoid a recession
of some magnitude," he said.
Some economists however are
very optimistic. Reuben E.
Slesinger, professor of economics
at Pitt, said in his annual forecast
for the nation’s economy that the
energy crisis will have less effect

than most people realize.

He predicts an annual increa_se
of $100 billion over this year's
estimated GNP index to a total
$1.281 trillion, exports exceeding
imports by $6 billion, and a
continuing. rise in prices. He
expects the rise to be slower than
last year, leveling off at a 4 to 4‘/2
percent increase.

Slesinger also said, “As to labor,
there is no indication that there will
be any shortages sufficiently
significant to cause major" pro-
blems. .

“If the economy can settle back
and political uncertainties become
stabilized, we can expect a
prosperous year.” '

Although American economists
are only predicting the possibility

here on campus to know what kind
of things have been happening
here, and to relate the facts and
circumstances surrounding these
incidents.”

He referred specifically to not
"only the alleged Saturday morning
instance, but also cited earlier
contentions of reported brutality
before the Isley Brothers concert at
Carnegie Music Hall and in the
detention of a black student by
campus police several weeks ago in
the Towers lobby.

“If we find that any of the
policemen were’ brutal beyond
necessity or refused to listen to
what students had to say in those
situations, then we'll call for their
dismissal,” Kilson said.

“We haven't decided who we
would like to see constitute the
investigating panel. We're open to
suggestions, since all we've had so
far is one meeting."

Petitions were circulated
throughout the audience of approx-
imately 150, composed of both
blacks and whites, and students
were asked to explore other
avenues of publicity. Letters,
phone calls, and classroom dis-
cussions were, among the other
alternatives advanced.

/“We feel the students should
"have a strong hand in deciding a
major part of the investigation and
the decisions that will hopefully
result from it,” Kilson explained.
“We are interested in finding out if

She called the future of controls

New York Times reported Common
Market authorities in Europe are
predicting the deepest recession in
a quarter century due to the, oil

The Times also reported that
conditions in Japan are steadily

worsening due to the oil crisis.

Many economists say the Euro-

crippled by the oil embargo and are
unable to maintain the amount of
self-sufficiency capable in America,

They also said that although many

Whitman said. “The public tends

to overestimate the effectiveness of .

controls. At the very best, controls
are limited and specific."
Whitman explained however, that
wage and price controls have

Other speakersat the seminar
were Dr. Arnold Weber. provost of
Carnegie-Mellon University and
dean of its Graduate School of
Industrial Administration, and
Heath Larry. vice-chairman of the
US Steel Board of Directors.
Weber. a public member of the
U.S. Pay Board, said he agreed
with Whitman on the future of
controls. but added, “We are
certainly going to go more towards
selective-decontrolization. We will
certainly have to control prices.
“There's a good bit of evidence to
suggest the wage side (of controls)
has had a salutary effect and a
longer half-life than the price
side."
Weber explained that in the life of

political effectiveness as they
decrease in actual effectiveness.

The effectiveness of the Nixon
wage controls was proven at the
beginning of Phase III when wages
did not rise disproportionately but
only increased annually at a rate of
4.8%.

“Over Phases I and II. the job was
done reasonably well." said
Weber.

“One ofthe general lessons we've
learned from controls is that they
are not self-liquidating. They
engender long-term economic and
political factors."

Larr_v recalled the economic
controls of World War II and the
Korean War. “I've never yet seen
controls operated more from a
standpoint of politics than from a
standpoint of economics. If we’re
going to have controls, they're
going to have to be more economic
than political."

the economy have been more
negative than the abandonment of

Area Students Get Second Chance

BY MARY BETH KENNEDY

South Hills students whose
college education was interrupted
and cannot return to college on a
full-time basis can enroll in Pitt’s
Community Educational Services in
their area.

As part-time students, the South
Hills residents could continue their
education from January 8 to April
22, 1974.

According to Dr. John R. Loch,
director of the Community Educa-
tional Services in South Hills, many
students are not able to return to
the institution of their choice
during the second term. This could
be a result of ﬁnancial, medical, or
personal problems.

Through the General Studies
temporary enrollment program,
students can take college-credit
courses. Later these credits can be
transferred to their own institution.

The students must acquire a
release from their original school
prior to enrollment in the tempor-
ary program.

A QPA of 2.0 or a qualifying
exam given by General Studies is
required before acceptance. If the

student has not attended college I

previously, a high school diploma
and a transcript of grades is
necessary.

Degree credit courses include
anthropology, economics, English,
chemistry. classics. geography,
math, music, philosophy. political
science, and sociology. Courses in

 Dear Editor:

This letter is in reply to the letters
by Joe McCormick and Joey Fuller

 in regard to the Teach-in on Racism

tee on Racism of which SDS was a

« , documented racism at Pitt.

Perhaps the most important
charge made by Mr. McCormick
was that no campus group has

had been at the teach-in he would

.have seen some documentation.

Just a few examples: 1) Pitt is
‘going to great lenghs to prevent

I _ hospital workers at Western Psych

from unionizing. If 1199 is
recognized‘at Pitt it will set a
precedent for other hospitals in the
very few of which are

organized. A high percentage of

hospital workers, especially in the
lowest payi-ng, hardest. most

an effort that could hurt a lot of
black working people. 2) -The
entrance exams used by Pitt for
both graduate and undergraduate

 admissions are racist. An example

A test

is the Miller Analogies test which is
required by many graduate depart-
ments and is supposed to be
“culture-free.” Questions on this
include items about ‘Greek
sculpture and old English and ask
the test-taker to play word
games--all these things are irrel-
evant to the ﬁelds the test is

_ required for, and are the type of

thing that the more white and
middleclass student will ﬁnd easier
to answer. 3) The recent attempt

more recent cuts of funds to and

other examples of racism. 4) The

minority students who go into the
sciences is a case of racism that
Mr. McCormick should be able to
document himself as he is in the
We could go on

textbooks, treatment of black
students, etc, but there's no room
here.

Next I would like to clarify a point
made by both Joe McCormick and
Joey Fuller, both of whom referred
to the teach-in as a white thing.
SDS, Progressive Labor Party, the
Third World Peoples Coalition are
all multi-racial organizations. The
people who organized this teach-in
were black, white, and from “Third
World” countries around the
world. As far as participation in
the teach-in, ‘there were more
nonwhite students and faculty than
white--including many members of
BAS.

We think BAS should have
participated more in organizing the
teach-in and should now participate
in the struggle against the
instances of racism at Pitt brought
out at the teach-in. But if
McCormick had been at the
teach-in he would have seen that
BAS did as much as any
organization to build and lead the
teach-in. McCormick might have
done better to ask why Student
Government or the University
Senate did so little. Racism is not
an issue that belongs to one race or

another. Of course black working
people and students have always
provided the best leadership to this
ﬁght (the ghetto rebellions, Attica.
Southern University to name a few
examples). And this will continue
to be the case. But white students
or workers ﬁghting racism is not
necessarily a matter of guilt or
paternalism, it is a matter of
survival. .

We in SDS feel that racism hurts
all working people and students. In
the south, where racism is more
pronounced. wages are lower and
conditions worse for everyone.
Another example is that of Western
Psych. While black workers in the
hospitals have the worst position.
conditions are lousy for white
workers too. (Arbitrary lay-offs,
unnecessary exposure to disease,
overwork. etc.) In fact many Pitt
students will one day work in
hospitals. It is in all our interests to
see that unions get into the
hospitals. And if the University
uses racism to break the union at
Western Psych, it is in all our
interests to ﬁght racism. /

One point regarding Joey
Fuller’s statement that rich whites
might be helpful in dealing with
racism. Rich whites [we mean the
really rich ones] got rich off of
racism and maintain 4‘ their power
through racism. They are the
enemies in the ﬁght against
racism, not potential allies. Also, it
is not the time for black students to
turn into themselves. Racism is on
the increase--conditions are worse
than ever for black working people,
and the ideas of racism are being
increased. Now is the time to ﬁght
back.

The Teach—in Against Racism
pointed the way to some concrete
ways to ﬁght racism at Pitt, from
building support for the Western
Psych workers, to ﬁghting to
abolish racist admissions tests and
ﬁghting to regain funding for the
Prison Education Project. We in
SDS encourage all students and
faculty, black and white, to join in
these struggles. For information

on CP-CIA collaboration will make
this clear to the reader.

The “community civilian control
of police,” for example, is also
being pushed by the CP’s Boston
school board candidate Pat Bonner-
Lyons. Not accidently, Bonner-
Lyons, in her eagerness to support
community control of police, can be
found in the camp of Boston police
chief and “ex”-CIA agent Robert
Kiley, the main ex onent of
community control in t at city.

Edelman's proposal of 25,000 jobs
for Pittsburgh youth is nothing
more than a government scheme to
create a reserve army of scab labor.

As layoffs continue and welfare
recipients are forced to work at
below union wages under the

 

vicious WIN (Work Incentives)
program. these youth can only
hope to land a job at the expense of
their parents or other unionized
workers. Nowhere does Edelman
propose the necessary unity of the
employed and unemployed which
could ﬁght for decent jobs for all
and end the present ﬂow of slave
labor into unions. In fact, the
Communist Party earlier this year
attempted to sabotage the founding
convention of the only organization
working to unite the employed and
unemployed around a classwide
program. That organization, the
North American Unemployed and
Welfare Rights Organization, was
founded despite the CP alliance
with yet another “ex"-CIA agent.
Ed Schwartz. Schwartz, some
readers may recall, was exposed in
1967 by Ramparts Magazine, as a
recipient of CIA funds through his
ofﬁce as vice-president of the
National Student Association.

In this light, Edelman's homilies
to “the right of every child to have
an education" become absurd.
Add to this the CP's support of
work-study programs and her
intentions are revealed as down-
right criminal.

As education budgets are slashed
and capitalists find it less expen-
sive to train a kid in a plant than
give him the conceptual tools
necessary to run an economy, the
CP falls into the ranks of every
government agent and poverty
pimp behind work-study. As CP
candidate Bonner-Lyons puts it:
“It’s a matter of cost-effectiveness

,--it is much more inexpensive to

teach a student in the Sylvania
Electric plant than training in the
schools. And more importantly,
the student_ can learn much more in
the Sylvania plant...We think
work-study gives a lot of kids who
would otherwise drop out some-
thing to do until we get something

better in the future.” Perhaps in

the future, Edelman will find jobs
for her 25,000 youth building the
promised 50,000 black housing
units at the expense of starving
construction workers.

Joining the CP in this “Night of
the Living Dead" is the Socialist
Workers Party. These necrophil-
iacs are now giving “critical
support" to Edelman’s campaign.
the logic being that she is better
than any of the “capitalist”
candidates! Of course, worship of
the dead is nothing new to the
SWP. Having excused themselves
from revolutionary activity in the
past by faithfully recanting the
Passion and Cruciﬁxion of Leon
Trotsky, the SWP ﬁnds in the CP a
purgatory in which to await His
Second Coming.

Through their “unconditional
support of black liberation move-
ments," the SWP has discovered a
warmy' body in the person of
Imamu Baraka, a known recipient
of CIA funds through the Pruden-
tial Life Insurance Company and
the Ford Foundation. Baraka, or
Aunt Jemima, if you wish, received
his spiritual education in the gutter
philosophy of the “Seven Princi-
ples of Kawaida” from Maulena
(Ron)- Karenga, police agent and
murderer of Black Panthers. The
support of such scum is Qonven-
iently “justiﬁed" by its principle of
‘‘,black self-determination”--
another way of slickly denying their
impotence to organize the ghetto.

In her own confused manner, Beth
Edelman has perhaps best cap-
tured the essence of both the CP
and SWP when she stated that
“our program is not a program for
socialism. It is a program for
immediate needs of the people.”
In other words; “Who are we to
make a revolution? What have
immediate needs to do with

running the economy? If we beg mmmumuu

the government hard enough and
maybe work through their agen-
cies, they’ll give more money to
community control projects. From
there we can build a base and then,
maybe in twenty years...”

If you're sick of the posturing and
campus antics ofthe left there exist
two organizations with the know-
ledge and the guts to take over this
rotting government in the next ﬁve
years. The National Caucus of
Labor Committees and the North
American.Unemployed and Wel-
fare Rights Organization are in the
process of building a mass based
working class movement to elim-
inate from history any trace of the
CP or SWP and the local control
ideology on which they exist. We
will not permit the CP and SWP to
drag the working class and its allies
into the graves which the former
now occupy. We bury our dead.

Nuclear Power: Short  Term 5

used in all nuclear power plants
including the one in Shippingport
near Pittsburgh. But they cannot
figure into the present crisis.

“By 1980, nuclear power plants,
which are now under construction,
will produce one-third of this
country’s present electrical needs.
The problem is that in 1930; it will
be only 20 per cent of our electrical
needs,” said] Cohen. ‘‘It has been
taking about 10 years to build a
nuclear plant from the time an
order is placed to the time it
produces electricity.” ,

The scientist pointed out that the
use of energy doubles every 30 or
40 years and the use of electricity
doubles" every. 10 years. Mean-
while. the world's total supply of oil
will probably run out in less than
100 years and coal in a couple
hundred years. I

that nuclear plants cause environ-
mental dangers, but they are far
less than other kinds of power
plants. Coal power plants (60 per
cent of the power plants in the US
are coal) are responsible for tens of
thousands of deaths per year from
air pollution.”

He explained that about half of
the 50,000 to 100,000.deaths per
year from cardiac and respiratory
diseases caused by sulphur in the
air can be attributed to coal power
plants.

“The chances of a very serious
accident_ occurring in a nuclear
plantfare one in a million years,"
he said.‘ “It would take a fantastic
combination of circumstances for
an accident to occur.”

Cohen pointed out that about
50,000 deaths would result from a
nuclear catastrophe which is still
less than the number of annual
fatalities from coal power. _

He . sees no solution to the
immediate energy crisis. “There is
nothing we can do that will help in
the next three years," he said.
“We can either use less energy or
get the Arabs to give us more oil."

' . The long range solution to the

energy problem, according to the
physicist, is solar energy, which

Q's (10" BTU)

converts energy from the sun’s
rays into power. This will develop
in the next century. Nuclear
energy is a median range solution
to supply our energy needs until
the advent of solar energy. _ Cohen
believes that nuclear development
has progressed well.

“The critics of nuclear power,"

he said, “have caused delays and a -

lot of discussion, but they have not
stopped nuclear development."
Another man keenly interested

‘in the development of nuclear

power is -David L. Marshall,
coordinator of Environment Pitts-
burgh. He strongly disagrees with
Cohen's ﬁgures for the probability
of nuclear catastrophe.

“No one, not even the Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC), has
any engineering basis for pre-
dicting the probability of a major
nuclear accident,” he said. “There
have been so few nuclear reactors
for so few years that any estimate is
pure conjecture.” . _

Marshall said that the ABC has

. estimated that the cost to society of

a_ major" nuclear accident would be
at least
property damage, I
human damage.
“A man from the AEC said that

if the probability of an accident
were one in 10,000 per reactor per
year, which of course is not proven, .
this would be a reasonable cost for
society to pay. If his figures were
correct, then by the year 2000,
when there will be over 1,000
nuclear power plants, then there
would be a major catastrophe once
every ten years. In my view, this is
not a reasonable cost for society to
pay,” he said.

Another reason Marshall objects
to nuclear plants is because of the
danger from the waste materials.

“One of the wastes‘, Plutonium
239; is one of the most toxic
substances known to man. Just
one gram of it could kill nine billion‘

. people. and one billionth of a gram

could cause lung canc_er in a human
if breathed into the lungs. By the
year 2000, 1100 tons of Plutonium
239 wastes from nuclear plants will
be deposited annually. Our
engineering for the disposal of
these wastes would have to be
99.‘-)999...per cent accurate to avert
a major disaster.”

“Also, the ‘radioactivity from
nuclear waste materials remains
active for over 240,000 years.’
There is presently no known
method for containing it for over
five years. And there is increasing

medical evidence that man has a I

greater sensitivity to radioactivity
than what was earlier believed. In
this light, it is no ‘longer an
engineering question, but a moral
question. Do we want’to subject
future generations of man to the

" dangers. of radioactivity for -thou-

sands of ‘years just to supply our
immediate energy needs?”

profession. claims he is no

Chinese opera proved to be less
exciting than a good dish of chicken

that the costumes were coloruful,
the acrobatics were daring and the
music and singing unusual. But,
an hour later, I was ready to be

something to which I am not

Back to the west on Friday night.
The Pitt Men’s Glee Club,
Chatham College Choir and the
Pittsburgh Youth Symphony of-
fered a semi-seasonal concert at
the Carnegie Music Hall. It was
free to the public, but worth more
than the price.

Chatham opened the show with
The Ceremony of Carols by
Benjamin Britten. This was
followed by the Glee Club. I have
seen the group only once before
this latest concert, and that was a
performance, of French religious
music. In Friday night’s concert,
they proved themselves to be
capable of handling choral music
from many lands and in many
styles. These ranged from 16th

century motet of Josquin DePrez, a,

Schubert — lieder and a gospel
number among others.’ '

The grand ﬁnale of the evening
featured the Glee ‘Club, Chatham
Choir and the Youth Symphony
performing Poulenc’s Gloria. Mary
Ann Doody was solo soprano. I
enjoyed it. ~ A friend of mine’ who
came specifically tohear the Gloria
commented that it was better in
parts than a recent recording of the
work on Angel records. He was
especially impressed by Ms.
Dood’s solo sections.

Wrapping up the weekend on a
real good note was An Evening of
Dance and Mime. here at the
Studio Theatre.

They never cease to amaze and
delight me there. Every show
brings not only a fresh look at
varied theatre works, but a whole
new theatre as well.

This particular program included
so many pieces that it would be
impossible to go into them all. so I
will hit the high spots.

Two mimes done by Nancy Lyon
stole the show until the first
intermission. These were entitled
the “Tuba Player” and “Mountain
Climbers.”

. Also in this ﬁrst act were sets.

called “Crossings” and “Environ-A
ments." Using groups of dancers.
some captured the abstract con-
cepts of movement in space, while

others had deﬁnite statements on ‘ :

human relations, and social pro-
blems. ‘ /I though the “Dance
Number 1" was great. This had a
solo dancer moving to a sonata by
J. S. Bach. The music was off key
and hesitant at times’. I later found
out from‘ one of the stage hands
that the pianist had ﬁubbed and
everybody was embarassed. But it

"was so effective that I think they

should leave it in the
mistakes and all «.

The closing number of Act II was
“Simple Gifts,” music by Aaron
Copeland, based on Martha Gra-
ham’s Choreography. Beautifully
danced. it came across better than

show,

many of the things I've seen by
so-called professional dance
troupes. ’

A rousing ending to a ﬁne show
was the “H_atian Love Dance.” It
began with a group ‘of ﬁve and a
conga drum, and ended ‘with the
whole audience and cast partaking
in a frenzied curtain-call boogie.

Why is this system, so different?

Utilizing our 15 years experience in engineering
installing and repairing thousands of component
systems we havedesigned the new value in the
$339 price range. We have worked very hard to
make it sound much better and last longer than
any other competitive system. ‘

This great system has been made possible by the
introduction of three new components from
manufacturers who are notorious for their out-

standing quality. Their products do not become ,

obsolete in a short time.

Advent (the name most feared by competitors in
the speaker business) has introduced the Ad-
vent2 Loudspeaker. It has the overall life—like
sound of the larger Advent Loudspeaker with

slightly less deep, deep bas. Still, the Advent/2
costing ‘$58 goes deeper than any competitive

‘speaker selling. below $140. What _a tool in

designing great low cost systems. ‘r

The Kenwood I<R—2300FM-AM receiver delivers
28 watts RMS with low distortion ‘into the full

' range of the Advent/2 loudspeakers. These are

not junior commando paper claims but real con-
tinuous power that -we can substantiate with
laboratory tests. The Kenwood KR—23OO has
cleaner high ‘than any other competitive
receiver. 3

The BSR 31OAX automatic turntable, with-

the Shure 75 magnetic cartridge, is an updated
version of a quiet, gentle, and steady unit that

‘has proven its reliability inithousands of our

more expensive systems.

If purchased separately the cost of the com-
ponents would be $402. The system price of
$339 also includes connecti_ng cables, turntable
base and cover, an opus one check out, and our

exclusive«3 year guarantee on all parts and
labor.
ponents will back up that guarantee.

If you have been unimpressed by the medioc_re

”big deal” $400 stereo systems that those super‘ 7
salesmen around town have been pushing, then‘ V

you deserve arefreshing change. Listen to the
natural sound of opus one’s $339 stereo system.
Your reaction will be DYNAMITE’.

Morgantown, W. Va.---Well, at
least it wasn't by one point. If it
would have been, they would have
had to carry ‘Bu7.z' Ridl out of the
West Virginia Colloseum in a
straight jacket.

As it was, his team had lost 82-78
and he was hardly audible. The
can of Coca-Cola in his right hand
could have been mistaken for a
portion of jello--I mean it was
shaking. _ '

It was a year ago, more precisely
the last game a year ago, that a
little guard by the name of Harold
Black swished a 15 footer to sink
the Panthers 59-58. A much better
Pitt team lost to West Virginia by
one point, then. It was the point
heard all the way back at Oakland.
Bitter, a lot of people asked for
Ridl’s job. They almost got it.

But a new year always brings
new optimism and despite the loss

\ you could not help believe this was

a better Pitt team. Bill Knight had
another brilliant night. He hit on
14 or 25 fielders, was two for two
from the free throw line for 30
points. Knight didn't score for the
first six minutes of the game, but
took command at the eight minute
mark and scored 10 of his 16 first
half points to push the Cats ahead
by three at the half. But, that was
not surprising, Knight always does
that.

The play of center Jim Bolla and
Junior College transfer Lew Hill
was. They were both question
marks before the game. Bolla
scored 11 of Pitt's first 18 points
before succombing to foul trouble.
In fact, he did not score a point the
rest of the way, spending a great

“We wanted to finish in the top
three before we got there," said
Coach Dick Bradshaw of the
swimmers’ performance at the
Penn State Relays, “but when we
got there and looked over what the
rest of the teams had‘, we were a
little worried."

Mark'W'allace, called by his coach “the best backstroker in the East

deal of the time on the bench.

Hill scored nine of his 11 in the
second halfto take up the slack and
was involved in the turning point of
the game.

With the second half tip off, Hill
apparently broke away on a layup
that would have given the Cats a
five point edge. But he was called
for traveling and the Mountaineers
went on to score six unanswered
points.

“The start of the second half was
the turning point of the game,”
Ridl, who was cooled by the Coke
and who had regained his
composure, said. “They took Hill’s
basket from us and they went down
and scored three (field goals) in a
row. It wasn't traveling.”

Ridl was not bitter of the overall
officiating, except to say that the
traveling calls were questionable.
But it was foul

Forward Mickey Martin joined
Bolla in’ foul trouble and did a
miraculous job of becoming the
fourth Pitt hoopster to crack into
the double figure column with his
12 points. With the start of each
half, the Panthers committed seven
fouls in six. minute spans.

Ridl, however, looked to West
Virginia's improvement from a
year ago as the deciding factor. “I
think West Virginia is a better team
than last year," he said. “They
have a lot more offense with Eartha
Faust." _ I

Faust a JC transfer from
Vincennes, scored 23 points in his
first game as a Mountaineer. He
took control early in the second half

on the Pitt guards.

And that's where the Cats hurt
the most. They managed only one
point out of their starting guards--
Kirk Bruce and Tom Richards--
while Ken Wagoner and Keith
Starr managednine between them
as subs.

Levi Phillips, who was involved
in the automobile accident which
killed teammate Larry Harris two
years ago and who sat out all last
year as a result, complemented
Faust very nicely with 11 markers.
Warren Baker, the 6-7 sophomore
superstar’ scored 21 and forward
Jerome Anderson chipped in, also
with 11. «

Center Larry Carr copped nine
points despite being intoxicated
with three and four personals most
of the night. He finally fouled out.

“What else can you say about a
game like that," Ridl added. “It

wasan exciting game; a heck of an --

opener.
When asked what he thought of
the Colloseum after two consecu-
tive games, Ridl got a shot in.
“We’ve lost two games here,"
he said. “We've been five points
short. It's a nice place to play in."
Ridl was being sarcastic and you

BY G. W. STEVENS

Powered by the line of Rick
Vernon, Charlie Hagins and Denny
Browne, the Pitt hockey team
waltzed to their third consecutive
league victory last night by
defeating Indiana 6-2.

The victory gave the Panthers sole
possission of first place with a
two-point lead over Carnegie-Mel-
Ion.

Indiana really didn't give the
Panthers much competition last
night as the Pitt skaters took the

Indiana really didn't give the
Panthers much competition last

night as the Pitt skaters took the
opening face-off and controlled the
play for most of the game.
However, Indiana was able to get
the first goal, when Darryl Coe
carried the puck into the Pitt end
and flipped an off-balance shot
towards the Pitt nets. Pitt goalie
John DeFazio lost sight of the puck
and it slipped past him into the left
corner of the net.

That was about all Indiana was
going to get for the rest of the game
as the Pitt defense tightened and

the offense went to work. Vernon, 

Hagins, and Browne scored two

goals apiece to account for all of the _

Panther scoring. Browne opened
the Panther scoring at 4:07 of the
first period when he took a pass
from Hagins and slammed it by
Indiana goalie, Joe Laduke. That

One of the spots where Brad-
shaw thought he would pick up
those places was the 200-yard
medley relay. The Pitt team was
seeded first in the event at the
pre-lims but some slow starts
hampered the Cats and they could
only net a third place. Bradshaw
thought he had stacked the race but

Natali, and Scheppner could not

Civils Smack

BY RICH STOUFFER

The Civil Engineers, staying
calm under fire, overcame a strong
defenseniinded Brackenridge 22-6
to stay alive in the intramural
playoffs. ‘
The Civils wasted no time in
moving the ball. Lenart took the
opening kickoff getting to midfield
before being pushed out of bounds.
With a first and ten, Lenart snuck
for a first down to the 30. Gans put
on a strong rush catching Lenart in
the backﬁeld for a loss of five. But
on 2nd and 15. Lenart found Colella
all alone on the left sideline who
ran it in for the score. The kick by
Sciulli was good and Civils led 8-O.

Brackenridge took thekick -but the
offense hadn't jelled. Mazur put
on a strong rush to get Rohan and
faced with fourth and long yardage.
Brackenridge punted. -

Lenart came on and again put
together another score. He hit
DelGrec0 for a first down to the 30.
Lenart picked up another quick 10,
this time hitting Euler for another
first. But Brackenridge rushed
hard pushing the Civils back six
yards. Rolling right, Lenart
spotted Del Greco all alone and the
Civils led by 14. Sciulli converted
and Civils led 16-0.

Brackenridge moved well on their
next series. Rahon to Meenan
picked up eight yards then a Rahon
to Palmer pass went to the eight
yard line. Things backﬁred for
Brackenridge when Rahon went to
the air the third time. Saunders
intercepted for the Civils to stop
short the Brackenridge drive.

Using the blitz to their advan-
tage, Brackenridge kept the en-

.gineers' near their goal forcing

them to punt on fourth down. It
took Rahon only two plays to cross
the goal line. I
The big play was a short screen to
Johns who put a great move on one
man then streaking all the way to
the three before being hit. With a
first and goal, Rahon rolled to his
left then tucked the ball just
making it into the endzone. The

extra point was blocked and at the
half the Civils led 16-6.

What the second halflacked in
scoring it made up in good
defensive play. An interception by
the Civils cut short a drive by
Brackenridge to start the second
half. Rahon threw to Palmer, but
the pass was tipped right into the
hands of the Civils‘ Premic.

Lenart took over moving the ball
on a sneak to the 35. On second
down he hit Colella for eight and
the first down. But Brackenridge
used the blitz to perfection, rushing
as many as four out of six men at a
time. but the plan worked. On
fourth and six. Sciulli tried a 46
yard field goal but the attempt was
wide with the score remaining 16-6.

Neither team could get their
offense moving for the rest of the
second half. Lenart could not get
away from the Brackenridge blitz
while Rahon had trouble com-
pleting passes for first downs. The
highlight of the half seemed to be
the intercepting ability of the
Civils’ Premic who always seemed
to be in the right place at the right
time. 1

The final score came with less
than a minute to go in the game.
Brackenridge had gambled on‘ a
fourth down and lost with the Civils
taking over. Lenart called "the
Quarterback keeper to beat the four
man rush and it worked as he ran
all the way for the touchdown. The
kick was good with the ﬁnal: the

AP--The Los Angeles Rams
clinched the National Football
Conference West Division title
Sunday behind the running of
rookie Larry McCutcheon and the
kicking of veteran David Ray, plus

the running of Buffalo's O.J.
Simpson.

McCutcheon rambled for 152
yards on 24 carries and Ray

connected on field goals of 30. 16,
39, and 26 yards as the Rams
blanked the Chicago Bears 26-0.

Simpson snuffed out Atlanta's
title hopes by ranibling.for 137
yards as Buffalo ended the Falcons’
winning streak at seven games with
a 17-6 upset. Atlanta, however,
still has a shot at a wild-card spot in
the National Football League
playoffs.

For Los Angeles, it was the 10th
victory against just two losses in
the first year under Chuck Knox.

Everyone else is still in the running
except New England, the Jets,
Baltimore, Houston and San Diego.

The Los Angeles defense, second
only to Miami in points allowed,
completely blanketed the Chicago
attack. The Bears m_ade it across
midfield just once the entire
afternoon and that was on a pass
play that ended with George
Farmer fumbling the ball away at
the Ram 46,

The Los Angeles touchdowns
came on a three-yard burst by Jim

Bertelsen and a nine-yard dash by

Les Josephson.

Simpson equalled an NFL record
by gaining more than 100 yards for
the ninth game this season in the
Buffalo victory. Simpson picked up
137 yards on 24 carries to increase
his total for the year to 1587--
second best in league history.
Simpson has two games left to pick

Jim Brown's all-time record for a
single season of 1,863.

shutout since 1962. Ken Anderson
picked the Minnesota secondary

apart with short passes, including a -

seven-yard touchdown toss to Bob
Trumpy. Essex Johnson raced 40

‘yards for another Bengal score.

Veteran Sonny Jurgensen, play-
ing in relief of the injured Billy
completed 11 straight
passes to lead Washington on two
long fourth-quarter touchdown
drives. Larry Brown scored all
three Redskin TDs, two of them on
short runs and the third on a

two minutes to tie Kansas City.
Greg Pruitt’s 65-yard sprint and a
