  Thousands pack Market Square for Al Gore

By Frank Porco

 and Mike Johns

’.
‘*5.

The Pitt News

An estimated crowd of 5,000
people lined the streets of
Market Square yesterday to we]-
come vice presidential hopeful
Al Gore. ' -

Members of the crowd were
mostly enthusiastic Democrats
displaying their spirit with U.S.
Senate candidate Lynn Yeakel
and Clinton/Gore ‘92 signs.

Marti Crouse, one of the
crowd members and an employ-
ee at a local bank, said that she
was at the rally mostly out of
interest and support for Gore.

“I am’ here out of interest
for my future,” Crouse said. “I
would like for Gore to be more
solid in the content of his
speeches, but I like his back-
ground  I also like the priori-
ties and experience that he had.”

A few of the members of the
crowd were pro—life supporters

holding signs that read “Unbom,

Trash” and “Stop Abortion
Now.”

Angry fans of the Pittsburgh
Pirates and a few happy fans
of the Atlanta Braves went
into an uproar in Schenley
Quad last night after the
Pirates lost game seven of the
National League Champ-
ionship Series, 3-2 in the
ninth inning.

Screaming students were
throwing rolls of toilet paper

on being pro-choice. He shout-
ed such things such as, ‘,‘You’ll
be held accountable for the
mass murder of a million and a
half babies every year,” and “It’s
not too late to turn to God and
repent from the sin _of abortion.”

Gore told me Pitt News about
his plan for college students if
he gets elected.

“Govemor Clinton and I have
come up with a plan to make
ﬁnancial aid available to all stu-
dents who want to go to col-
lege,” he said.

“The plan allows students to
receive financial aid and pay it
back by some type of service to
their country for two years,” he
said.

Several of the guests at the
rally were able to share their
views on campaign issues with
The Pitt News. ,

Yeakel told The Pitt News that
it is very important for college
students to turn out and vote on
Nov. 5.

“It is one of the most irnpor—
tant elections of your lifetime,”
she said. “We simply do not
have quality leadership.’’ ’

and some glass objects out of
windows of the Towers and
the residence halls in the
Quad.

“It is really uncalled for.
The celebration would be
one thing, but bottles out of
the windows are ‘another
thing,” said Walt Waters,
assistant director of Campus
Police.

Dan Woodbry, a Braves
fan, said that inside he is
going crazy, but he does not

Marriott will begin planning
a three—year renovation of Pitt’s
dining facilities next week.

The plan will include a
review of current services as
well as the possibility of addi-

tional retail space across the

campus.

One area of proposed reno-
vation is the Schenley Cafe in
the William Pitt Union.

“It’s pretty safe to assume
that what you see now is not
what you’re going to see next
year,” said James Jenkins, gen-
eral manager of Pitt Dining
Services.

The initial thought for a
Schenley Cafe overhaul,
Jenkins said, is to create a food

court. The court would be a

combination between brand
name and in—house concepts.
This would possibly include
one or two brand chains as
well as providing deli, grill,
pizza andvsalad services.

Jenkins said Marriott plans to
“open [the cafe] up, give it a
different look, so we can put
more people through the facili-
ty as well as meet what needs
we can identify. It certainly
wasn’t designed for what it is
trying to handle now.”

Early rumors of a Taco Bell
being installed in the Union
concourse area are premature,

Jenkins said.

“Marriott has the availability
of other chains,” Jenkins said.
“We have agreements nation-
wide with other brand names.
Taco Bell‘ may or may not be
in the final package.

“Who knows what we will
look at. We have the availabili-
ty to look at just about any-
thing that’s out there.”

Other brand names associat-
ed with the Marriott corpora-
tion include Pizza Hut, Burger
King, TCBY and Mrs. Field’s
Cookies, as well as Taco Bell.

The plan has three stages,

according to Jenkins. Marriott’s
design and development
department, along with archi-
tectures, will be at Pitt starting
next week to examine different
facilities. The Towers and
Lothrop Hall are among build-
ings possibly included in the
project.
Jenkins said that after
Marriott gets a solid idea of
what it wants to do, they will
meet with the management of
the Union,to coordinate ideas.

“A big part of this process
will be the Union and what
that management wants to
see,” he said.

Student and administrative
input will also be a focus in
the reconstruction, Jenkins
said. _

This wee/es remedy calls for the removal of stress

Stress is something that
almost all of us feel from time
to time. One of the most com-

,mon techniques for helping

people cope better with stress
is relaxation training. The belief
behind this technique is that if
we can learn deep muscle
relaxation, we can avoid the
negative side effects of stress
and live much healthier lives.

Some relatively new research,
however, suggests that another
effective way of combatting
stress is to “get tough.” Richard
Drensbier at the University of
Nebraska reports research find-
ings indicating that individuals
who are physiologically and
psychologically tough have dif-
ferent and healthier endocrine
reactions to stress than do
those who are less tough.

This toughness is achieved
by people who are willing to
push themselves physically,
mentally and emotipnally. The

cal area. We have known for a

long time that regular exercise.

strengthen our-
selves and
develop an
increased feel-
ing of compe-

tency. This
sense of com-
petence can

then be applied
to other chal-

cope with adversity.

It is also believedthat emo-
tional toughness can be
achieved by increasing risk—tak-
ing behavior. The behavior
may be physical such as rock
climbing, skiing, hang gliding
or any other activity that tests

‘ the limits of our strength and

endurance.

Intellectual risks may also be
beneficial in building tough-
ness. When we read a chal-

lenging areas of our lives.

We push ourselves emotion-
ally when we go outside our
ordinary behavioral patterns.
When we go to new places,
meet new people, go on a
blind date, assert ourselves in
more self-affirming ways, have
an honest talk with a parent or
friend about something impor-
tant to us or tell someone we
care about them, we expand
on our emotional ﬂexibility. We

grow increasingly more capable
each time we follow Robert
Frost’s advice and “take the
road less travelled.”

The message, in a way, is a
paradox. By deliberately
putting stress on ourselves in
ways that we can control, we
make an important contribution
to our long term capability for
handling stressful events that
may seem beyond our control.
So, if you want to get better at
handling the stresses in your
life push yourself, take some
risks and “get tough.”

you would like to see
addressed in a future column

Yeakel stressed the importance
of having a Democratic Congress
so that things could be put back
on track. She said that she is very
worried about the future.

“I have two children in col-
lege. I’m concemed for them as
well as the future of others,” she
said.

Tipper Gore said she plans to
continue working with children
and the homeless if she reaches
the White House.

“There are over 2 to 3 million
homeless people who need

Mark Lincoln-Marks, a fonner
Republican Congressman now
working for the Clinton/Gore ‘92
campaign, commented on the
bad shape of the economy, cast-
ing the blame on the ._poor lead-

‘ “George Bush is the Herbert

“Pennsylvania will deliver a large
majority for the ticket,” he said.

County Commissioner Tom
Foerster said the campaign start-
ed when Harris Wofford was
elected as Senator of
Pennsylvania. Foerster called for
an end to trickle-down econom-
ics.

Foerster also addressed the
issue of Clinton and Gore’s
future investment and family val-
ues. “Family values are not possi-

ble when we crm’t educate our
children. We c;m‘t have health
care for them and for all people,”
he said.

Gore told the crowd that we
are on step closer to getting
Bush and Quayle out of there.
He stressed that the American
people are ready for change, and
with the help of the people,
change will occur. He also
expressed his support for Lynn
Yeakel, who is running against

Republican Arlen Specter.

“A vote for her opponent is a
vote for continued dead ‘lock,
division and delay,” Gore said.
“But a vote for Lynn Yeakel is a
vote that would give Bill Clinton
and me help in changing
America and getting our country
moving forward again.”

Gore said that the

ly nothing to offer the American

The candidates debate

Two days ago on the campus of Georgia Tech
University, Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator Albert
Gore and retired war hero Admiral James Stockdale
engaged in the one and only vice presidential debate of
election 1992. At the end, many wondered who was ‘the
winner of the debate. Very few wondered, though, who

_)was the loser. V

The stage was set immediately — a contradiction of
styles if there ever was one. On one side of the fence
was the smooth, cool, rational southerner from
Tennessee. On the other side was the vivacious, dynam-
ic, young vice president. Across the street lay the politi-
cal outsider. .

While the duties of the vice president are vaguely
defined, no one can deny the importance of this job.
For, as we all know, the vice president assumes the
responsibility of leading this country in any sort of presi-
dential crisis. Gore was clearly the more presidential of
the two — seemingly better informed and more con-
cerned about substantive issues. “We have an environ-
mental crisis, a health—insurance crisis, substandard edu-

* 3 cation — it is time’ for a change,” Gore said.

Quayle, however, seemed more concerned with
mocking Gore’s character. We can’t count the amount of
times Quayle went off on a tangent or accused his legiti-
mate opponent of “pulling a Clinton.”_Nevertheless, this
is not to say that Quayle was a bore. The energy that
Dan Quayle showed was a refreshing change for a ticket
that is often portrayed as stale and trite.

The outsider James “Mr. Magoo” Stockdale began the
debate asking the questions, “Who am I? Why am I
here?” We’re asking the same thing.

But not too long ago we endorsed Bill Clinton for

\,t president. Gore’s performance enforces that endorse-

ment. But through ‘it all, it is difficult to condemn Dan
Quayle’s performance. Despite his misinformation and
unpresidential persona, the passion and energy he
showed is worthy of the praise that George Bush him-
self did not earn in the first presidential debate.

It is often said that choosing between candidates has
become a lesser of two evils, or as Stockdale put it, “I
think America is seeing right now the reason this nation
is in gridlock.” A kernel of accuracy if the truth be told.

However, given the choice between Quayle and
Stockdale — we choose Quayle every time. While we

"9 don’t vote for the vice president perse, the‘ position is

not one to be taken lightly. Dan Quayle defined himself
and could ‘possibly be seen as a legitimate candidate in

t ‘96. Starting strong, his performance slipped toward the

end. Likewise, Gore enforced the strength of his party.
These candidates rocked the boat by talking about some
serious issues — abortion and the environment among
them. Let’s hope Bush, Clinton and Perot will now do
the same.

A marijuana conspiracy theory

This is a declaration of inde-
pendence for those of us who
seek to grow, possess and use
the cannabis hemp plant —
known to most people as “mar-
ijuana.” To live freely one must
live without fear of the punitive
consequences the government
has established to restrict that
freedom.

The word marijuana was
coined by newspaper mogul
William Randolph Hearst dur-
ing the Spanish American War.
It was in his racist, “yellow
journalism” accounts that he
denounced Spaniards, Mexican-
Americans and Latinos and
tried to portray them as lazy
pot smokers.

Hearst reported the majority
of rapes against white women
were perpetrated by “marijua-
na—crazed Negroes.” African-
American musicians were por-
trayed as demons under the
inﬂuence of marijuana playing
anti-white ‘‘voodoo-satanic’’

» music (jazz).

The point is, prejudice, igno-
rance, power and disinforma-
tion were the tools used to cre-
ate the criminal association
with the term “marijuana.”

Marijuana re(e)fers to the leaf
and budding material of the
cannabis hemp plant. The
cannabis hemp plant is one of
the oldest cultivated plants on
our planet. It has been used for
thousands of years for fiber,
food, fuel, medicine and for rit-
ual and recreational purposes.

In 1916, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture wrote special
bulletin No. 404, which says

that one acre of cannabis
hemp, in annual rotation over a
20-year period, would produce
as much pulp for paper as 4.1
tree acres. When in the 1950s
mechanical hemp—fiber strip-
ping machines became state of
the art and affordable, Hearst
and other paper industry
tycoons stood to go bankrupt.
There is a lot more to tell,
many more facts to relate. Since
I started Help End Marijuana

Dan
Waterman

Prohibition at the University of
Pittsburgh in November of
1990, our group has been deliv-
ering the facts.

But facts are not enough.
After hearing what H.E.M.P. has
to say, some people go on to
explore the subject for them-
selves. Some turn around and
deliver the facts to others and

some ask, .“Why is hemp illegal -

if it is so beneficial?” Others just
don’t give a damn. ~

For some, it is easier to not
think about the issue and pas-
sively participate in the need-
less incarceration of thousands
of people. I have spent time in
one of those jails. However,
this article is not to lay blame.
There has been too much in
the way of laying blame in our
society and too little taking of
responsibility.

This is simply my declaration
that hemp is OK to grow, pos-
sess and to utilize. Now

whether that means growing
hemp to produce paper and
methanol fuel or rolling a mari-
juana cigarette to share with
friends. It is also my declaration
that I will take the responsibili-
ty to insure that my use'of
hemp does not hurt or endan-
ger others. Anything can be
used for good and for harm.
For too long the use of hemp
has been categorically deemed
as abuse by those who have
had the financial motivation
and political power to criminal-
ize this plant.

It is no coincidence that the
testimony before Congress in
1937, with the purpose of out-
lawing marijuana, consisted
almost entirely of Hearst’s racist
newspaper articles, read aloud
by Henry J. Anslinger, director
of the ,Federal Bureau of
Narcotics (the agency which
has since evolved into the Drug
Enforcement Administration).

I smoke marijuana, and no
amount of legislation, incarcer-
ation or disinformation will
change that. I don’t think
everybody should smoke mari-
juana, and I am not saying they
should.

I am simply saying that there
are beneﬁts from the use of it.
And we should realize that the
self—righteous “va1ues” engraved
in our heads are unfounded —
the brainchild of those in

‘power who had the most to

loose by its legalization.

Dom Waterman is the president
and founder of HEMP.

"But, Dan you can clear this up very simply
by-repeating after me: I support the right of
a woman to choose. Can you say that?”

debate on Tuesday.

far this season. Berndt said he
feels his team (1-4 overall, 0-1
in the Big East) is- not very
good right now. But after a
week off, he said he intends to
start a “new” season this week.

“Our week off came at a
good time for us, it was time to
lick our wounds and work on
the fundamentals,” Berndt said.

Berndt’s hopes of a “new”
season and a win against Pitt
will ultimately be determined
by his offense and particularly
by his quarterbacks.

Paliscak, a six—foot-four-inch

sophomore from Huntington,

Pa., will start this weekend
against Pitt. Paliscak has
thrown for only 441 yards this
season and has one touchdown
pass compared to four inter-
ceptions. Even with his slow
start, Berndt is confident that
Paliscak will come through.

“He’s the classic drop-back
passer,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said.of the Owls’ lead-
ing passer.

Drop-back passing is the

back. The Panthers did not

misfortune against an overdue
Paliscak. _

If the Panthers’ defense does
stop Paliscak, Berndt can
always ﬂip his coin over and
send in Baxter. Baxter, who
averages‘ 4.4 yards per carry,
could jumpstart the" Owls’
offense with his speedy option
prowess. _

“Marc [Baxter] is just a great
athlete,” Berndt said. “He runs
the option very well.”

Defending the option has
been another sore spot for Pitt.
The Panthers could not stop
West Virginia’s Darren Studstill
or Notre Dame’s Rick Mirer in

option offenses and could have
problems against the adroit
Baxter.

Baxter is currently third in
rushing on the Temple team,
behind tailback Sam Jenkins
and fullback Sidney Morse.
Jenkins, a 5’10”, 195-pound
senior, is a small runner with
tremendous speed. He has

scored a team-leading five‘

touchdowns and is currently
fourth in the conference in
kickoff returns.

' Another speedster that wor-
ries Pitt and Hackett is junior
college transfer Wilbur
Washington. The junior wide

receiver is leading the Owls in
pass catches (16) and receiving
yardage (204). His speed
should test Pitt’s defensive
backfield. 

But the key to the Owls’
offense is their offensive line.
The strong, senior-orientated
group led by Brian Erwin, Chris
Shanley and Joe Burgos has
been solid. Junior tackle Tre
Johnson has become a domi-
nant force. .

“Their [the Owls’l strength is
clearly their offensive line,”
Hackett said. “Tre Johnson is as
good as there is in the confer-
ence.”

people-in the way of jobs, eco-
nomic progress and proposals to
move our country forward again.

“The reason the Bush cam-
paign is using smear tactics
against Bill Clinton is because
they don’t have anything to say
about the issues that relate to the
future of this country,” Gore
said.

“Bush wants to talk about
what Bill Clinton did as a student
23 years ago,” he said. “But What
he doesn’t want to talk about is
American jobs going overseas.”

Gore accused Bush of break-
ing all the campaign rules when
he ordered political appointees
in the State Department to rum-
mage through the personal files

-11

of American citizens. Gore said
they searched in every embassy
around the world for any infor-
mation they might find on Bill’
Clinton as a student. A
“When you have the president
of the United States Ordering, the
officials of the U.S. government
to get involved in a political

campaign and be part of a- ’

McCarthyite smear effort, that’s
way beyond the pale,” Gore
said. .

“We are not going to put up
with it any more,” he said.
“George Bush and [Quayle] have
20 more days and  are out of
there. Bush would do absolutely
anything to get re—e1ected. That
means he would stoop to any
level.”

“We’d be crazy to make this

Jenkins said Marriott’s goal is
to propose a master plan for

administration by mid January.

-Indie Fest 11

Goes from funky at/am‘ pop to a gloomy psychotic reaction,

Indie Fest 2, featuring the manic guitar talents of Eugene Chadbourne, No
Safety’s frantic pop—art sounds and the Painteens dark, yet patiently brutal rock is as
eclectic a bill as the ‘Burgh has seen in months. Each group different in its own
way but skillfully -entrenched among the underground’s elite. _

No Safety, the bill’s opening act, hails from the braintrust of “Downtown” scene
veterans Zeena Parkins and Chris Cochrane. Formed in the mid-’80s with the idea
of mixing songs with improvisational freedom and sound concepts, the duo
expanded (in the late ‘80s) into a funky quintet with an ear on daring jazz textures
and random structures.

Adding the guitars of Doug Seidel, the drums of Pippin Barnett and the bass of

lenging vocals. Noise was scattered throughout the record, de-emphasized, result-
ing in complex ideas that never got lost among the artsy, on-your-toes rock they
manipulated.

Aperiod of expansion followed with each member picking up his or her instru-
ments and performing with their other bands, a staple of the incestuous relation-
ship that exists in the Downtown scene. But 1992 brought NS’s second full-length-
er, coming on the Knitting Factory label and featuring Tim Spelios on drums
replacing Barnett. Spill, while holding on at times to the band’s art-rock roots, is
more a testament of where the band is going than where it came from.

“We think of ourselves as a rock bandnow  it’s much more about the craft of

 
 
   
 

      
 
   
     
 
  
   
  

  

    
 
  
   

  
  
  

 

 
  
  
  

  
 

‘ lot of grit and some very real humor and

s irit.

pGas, Food Lodging has it. \X7riter/ director
Allison Anders’ debut centers on three
women; a single mother and her two
daughters. It’s life in a trailer park in the
stark little town of Laramie, N.M.

The youngest daughter, Shade (Fairuza
Balk), searches for their long—absent father
in the midst of the battles between her
mother Nora (Brooke Adams) and sister
Trudi (lone Skye). Shade finds comfort in
the melodramas of Elvia Rivero. Sitting in
the local Hispanic theatre she finds a
heroine who makes her “laugh when

and an abrasive‘ mouth —— are real
enough, and Skye gives her a rage pulled
thin over vulnerability. She pays a steep
price for getting involved with men who,
she admits, aren’t “interested in my f—
ing vocabulary.” She works as the films

' most tragic figure, but to Anders’ credit it

is never thatsimple. In the end Trudi sur-
vives, leaving Laramie behind.

Brooke Adams pulls off the frustration
of Nora. She carefully elicits the wisdom
and anger in Anders’ screenplay. Trying
to fend off an old lover’s advances she
says, “Women are lonely in the ‘90s. It’s
our new phase. We’ll live.” Dipped in sar-

 
  
       
    
    
   
    

 

ers. James Brolin, as the father, passes
through the ﬁlm and Shade’s life too late.
His absence meaning more than his pres-
ence, Brolin highlights the male cast. For
most of the men (and sometimes the
women), this film is just a way station;
with the exception of Javier (Iacob
Vargas), who opens up the desert and a
new hope for Shade.

The plot doesn’t drive this film. This
isn’t Thelma and Louise. These women
don’t exist in opposition to anything
(men). Their commentary lies solely in
their being, not their gender. With all that

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

Director Ridley -Scott’s two-
and-a-half—hour screen version of
the Christopher Columbus myth,
1492 Conquest Of Paradise, is so
brutally‘ tedious that it makes the
horrors of the Spanish
Inquisition seem sympathetic.

It is also devastatingly long
and drawn out, trying to tackle
as much of the mystique as pos-
sible, that it becomes disenfran-
chised with its focus — putting
the viewer through an agonizing
journey, that makes the viewer
wish Queen Isabella never said
yes.

The whole concept seems like
it never had a chance. The cast-
ing is pathetic. Gerard
Depardieu, a born Frenchman
with an accent healthy enough
to tell you so, portrays the
Italian—born, Spain-dwelling
Columbus. As the eigplorer he

speaks none of the above, but
rather English, throughout the

. film, with a heavy French inﬂec—

tion that immediately contrasts
any notion of legitimacy we
might have of the film. It is
indeed a very sad affair.

We first see Columbus in one
of the many roles the film maker
lays upon his character. Sitting
on the rocky seaside of Spain, he
teaches his youngest son the joys
of sailing. This is the film’s basic
assertion, and it sticks to it the
whole way — Columbus as a
heroic figure. He can do no
wrong amongst his family. His
son views him as an icon, while
his wife loves him no matter
how long he is gone. The film
blatantly asserts him as the first
truly great absentee father.

Columbus is shown as a dream-
er — everybody thinks he’s a
fool. But he is passionate about
his desire. In one of the movie’s

Public Enemy
Greatest Misses
‘Def Jam Recordings

Unlike the group’s previous
efforts, the release of Public
Enemy’s Greatest Misses did not
evoke widespread anticipation,
and with good reason.

This collection of six new cuts
and six remixed joints is, at best,
a step down from its four prior
efforts and undoubtedly must be
considered minor league in com-
parison to ‘earlier works.

It was surprising enough to
hear of new P.E. material coming
so soon after Last November’s
Apocalypse '9]: The Enemy
Strikes Blacle. This release leaves
you asking yourself, why? The
obviousanswer is money, but
trying to rationalize Chuck D.’s
other motives here is a difficult
task. The cries of sell-out echoed
long ago, but this release only
lends more credibility to that evil
thought.

P.E. certainly did not need to
keep its name in the spotlight.
The group is always in it

_ Terminator

 

whether it has new material or
not. It might be a little harsh to
suggest that Public Enemy is on
the decline. Only a fool doubts
the mindpower of Chuck"I¥B.-, but
the fact remains that P.E. has a
reputation worth upholding and
while this albumsleeve warns
“This is not an album, coming in
1993 the LP titled  Peace”, this
collection is outright disappoint-
ing. .
The heavy-hitting lineup is
intact with Chuck, Flavor Flav,
X and Hank
Shock1ee’s Bomb Squad in a
couple tracks P.E. roars.

The single “Hazy Shade Of
Criminal” slams in classic Bomb
Squad fashion. Chuck delivers a
chaotic assault over a rumbling
track packed with layers of
noise, piercing background
sirens, deep bass and dense

beats. While the hard rhymer
unmasks who or what is truly
criminal, Terminator creates
mayhem of his own, ripping up
the turntables between verses.

“Some people accuse some
people of crirnes/ some people
get away wit’ losin’ my rhyme/
they don’t like where I’m coming
frorn/ so they play dumb.”

The speciﬁc targets of Chuck’s
blows are varied, for the most
part they are general rather than
specific, but he mentions «“he
who got the finger on the war
button,” “politickin’ writin’ bad
checks,” and “police supposed to
keep the peace” as some of the
real criminals that get away scot-
free while he gets persecuted by
biased media.

The other standout cut is
“Gotta Do What I Gotta Do,”
where Chuck is on a mission,

experienced provider
* FREE pregnancy tests
* STD Screening
* Experienced gyne care
* Counseling

* Abortion services to 17 weeks by the regions most

* Confidential, Convenient, Affordable to all.

kicking a lot of knowledge about
where he’s coming from. “I gotta
do what I gotta do/ so who the
hell is you/ to tell me how my
song is wrong/ you don’t know/
layout and let the drummer go 
But few know how my flow/
don’t get the proper review/ I
gotta do what I gotta do.” The
track is a definite departure for
the Bomb Squad, with a lot of
light organs and a live drum
sound rather than heavy beats.

After these two cuts there’s a
plethora of mediocrity. Chuck’s
ode to a fallen New York basket-
ball star, “Air Hoodlum,” is a
crawling, sometimes funky,
sometimes droning track where
Chuck’s deep bass vocals turn
lazy rather than hard while
organs and guitars get in the mix
as well as countless samples of
hoop announcers.

Dispersed in between cuts are
excerpts and sound bites of
interviews of and about P.E. “Is
this art or dangerous propagan-
da?” asks a voice into “Tie Goes

new cuts. There’s not a lot posi-
tive to say about it other than
Chuck’s perpetual knack for
thought-provoking lyrics. “Hit Da

P.E. anyway), stripped—down
groove — average at best. “Gett
Off My Back” is a silly Flavor
Flav rhyme that first appeared on
the Mo’ Money soundtrack.
Nothing against Flav, but this is
weak.

. THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 15, 1992.
Recommended flms playing in the area:

Glengarty Glen Ross —- A fine adaptation of David Mamet’s
Pulitzer Prize winner. The acting of Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon
and even Alec Baldwin holds together a plot that is given
away at the f1lm’s beginning. Intense dialogue and cursing fills
the screen in the critic’s fall darling. Directedrby James Foley.
Bob Roberts —— Spinal Tap meets JFK in writer/director Tim
Robbins’ hilarious, all—too—relevant satire of the political
process. Despite being “fiendishly funny,” the film comes
crashing down at its disturbing end. “This film cleverly skips
over the bombast and self-righteousness of most politically
bent films, injecting a healthy dose of humorous camp”
(Penman). Onlyshowing at the Galleria call 531-5551.

Gas Food Lodging — Allison Anders’ resounding debut con-
cerns the lives of three women in a small town. A truly “fresh
version of women in film” (Kirchner). Take the time to see it.
Opens Friday, Oct. 16 at Filmmakers at the Fulton, downtown.
Exclusive engagement. ’
Husbands And Wive —- Woody Allen doesn’t tackle any
new ground here but proves his uncanny ability to get serious
and force laughter in these (his) troubling times. “Despite the
suffering, Allen is able to manipulate humor and positive
vibrations into the big, stormy ending that runs parallel to the
plot’s almost hopeless ideal” (Berger). Playing exclusively at
the Oakland Beehive. A

hanging over it you still can’t
escape this collection D of
moments —— paced well and
pushed along by Shade’s hopeful
narration. Anders’ direction is
sharp enough to let her words
and characters hold the film
together. Anders doesn’t intrude
on her characters — something
as crucial to the narrative as
Shade’s voice-over.

In the midst of all that, this
ﬁlm is potentially about cinema
— its ability to illustrate mean-
ing, however incomplete, in
peoples’ lives. Whether it’s Elvia
Rivero or the home movies of

-her father, ﬁlm works for Shade.

It does that for us often enough.

telling scenes, Columbus empha-
sizes his passion for his voyage.
Going ir1to a ﬁt of rage he com-
mits blasphemy by cursing‘ god
and hurling Bibles into the air.
He is given penance and is silent
until a wealthy banking con-
glomerate ﬁnds him and offers to
speak to the Queen on his
behalf. Not even his devout
belief in god can hold back his
excited tongue now.

After sweet—talking Queen
Isabella (Sigourney Weaver),
Columbus gets his wish and his
mission is under way — as is the
ﬁlm’s true epic proportions. Big,
sprawling camera shots domi-
nate from here on out. The ﬁlm
cost an outrageous amount of
money to make and they don’t
waste it as far as the camera is
concerned. The initial sailing of
the three ships is massive, with a
huge ﬁery sun blazing as it sets
above golden waters with men
hard at work, sweating with their
shirts off. As the ships pass the
sun’s rays, you start to get the
feeling of how serious this cine-

maticeffort takes itself.

On board the ships, the crew
is near mutiny although you
would never know it if it wasn’t
for a*= quick announcement from
one of Columbus’ captains.
Columbus, heroic as ever, quells
this with a poorly written, obvi-
ous scn'pt. You could just guess
what Columbus has to say to his
troops about dreaming and stick-
ing to your guns.

The most eagerly awaited
moment, which is typically
blown out of the water with daz-
zling scenery shots, is what hap-
pens when they hit land. For this
crew, it’s a jungle out there —
literally. The crew bushwhack_s
its way through the wilderness
where it finally meets the inquisi-
tive Indians who treat them as
gods, or heroes.

From here out it’s all downhill,
filled with boring dialogue and
just plain unbelievable events.
How in the world did Columbus
find an interpreter among the
Indians who never knew anyone
but themselves existed? It’s sim-
ple questions like this, particular-

ly in a two-and—a-half—hour
movie, that fail to get addressed
and discredit the whole film’s
objective.

Characters who dominate the
screen towards the end (yet are
never seen before) make for a
confused viewer. Out of
nowhere comes another subtext
of the ﬁlm — The battle of good
vs. evil, in the form of Moxica
(Michael Wincott). He is
assumed to be some type of
Spanish overseer in charge of
monitoring Columbus and even-
tually sabotaging him. But his
role is never defined and his
negative presence exists. The
same can be said of earlier char-
acters, all of whom we must
assume are Spanish elite.

The end, which seems like it is
never going to arrive, is in com-
plete disarray. Not only have we
had the most unexciting action
sequence (a war between the
natives and the colonists) ever in
a movie of this epic proportion,
but we have a fantastic storm
scene in which the city they

taking vocals and delivering catchy riffs. While Spill is
longer and seemingly more thought out than Ylois Lost Leg,
both are shining examples of the band’s reﬂex-like rock.
Live, they can take on a completely different tone, one ﬁlled
with unstructured jams _and wild instrumentations that are
always challenging and compelling.

Quite opposite, part of the Fest’s overall emphasis, is the
death threats of Trance recording artists and Texas back-
wards, the Painteens. Hailing from Houston and led by a
leather clad dominatrix (Bliss Blood), who often brings her
whip on stage, the Painteens create a dismal atmosphere
that is as much a part of the sick society some of us dwell
in as it is a portrait of it. Two records and a few scarce sin— -
gles deep, the Painteens has etched its name on the grave-
stone of Indie rawk.

Combining the subtleties of ’ psych(o) cord repetition with

dense, trance-inducing noise, the band doesn’t allow you to
have fun, just morbid thoughts and heavy—handed action.
Each song on its latest effort, Stimulation Festival is a murky
inner battle. Songs like “Evil Dirt” about a voodoo radio
show, “Living hell,” which gets into the thoughts of crimi-
nals and “Drowning” exemplify the band as well as the
state’s' willingness to think in terms of suffering. The albums
most adventurous cut is a cover of The Birthday Party’s
“Wild World.” Stretching the piece into a complete mood of
decay, it loses some of the brashness of the original but
adds depthtothe bad vibes the song can give off. With a
whip, constant strobe lights and some exposition to boot,
the Painteens are a must see as a live act.

The worst, longest and most metaphoric scene of themovie
is the triumphant raising of a bell by both factions. It is so
trumped trying to grasp the great deeds of Columbus that it is
easily laughed at, which is not what the makers of this film
intended. What they did intend was to perpetrate the myth of
Columbus as a great person, and they accomplish that task.
Unfortunately, It is easily the worst epic film I have ever seen,
and that includes Robin Hood.
