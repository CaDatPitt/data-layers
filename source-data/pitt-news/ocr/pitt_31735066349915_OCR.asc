 Asks Prison   Reform

by LINDA SAVAGE
- «About 300 people met in reac-

“ tion‘ to Attica at the Black Ac-’

 tion Society (BAS) Political Ral-

iiﬁnature of the system and of the

ly Monday evening. s‘ H
Prison reform, the deaths at At--
tica, and black involvement were
major themes discussed at the
rally held in David Lawrence

,¢,Hall.

In reference to Attica, Richard

. Utley, Chairman of the BAS said,

“We’re always sorry about what’s
happening to someone else, but
what does‘ it take to get you peo-
'ple motivated? Does something
have to happen to a friend or a
member’ of your family before
you do anything?"
I Speaking of the contradictory

inhumane treatment in prisons,
Brother Ralph of the Committee
‘for Prison Reform-Vibrations II
charged, “people are criminals
but the wrong criminals are be-
ing confined."

Instructing the blacks to mob-
ilize, Brother Ralph moved the
audience to a standing ovation

ggwith, “We must know precisely

‘Tia who the criminal is in American.

society, the ones who force man
to be deprived of his humanity.
We blacks have not much'hum-
anity to lose, but’. everything to
gain." ’

Brother Saluadia, chairman of
the Congress of African People,
suggested organizing and harn-
essing’ strength to bring power
and unity to the blacks of the
Pitt campus.

“The massacre at Attica should
inspire you to tighten up here
and tighten up your own heads
so the black men at Attica didn‘t
die in vain," Salaudia said.

*1’ “I doubt if you would feel for

your brothers at Attica as you
feel for your blood brothers
here,‘_‘ Salaudia continued. “The
only thing that binds you is the
fact that you’re African and the
fact that you’re powerless.”

Puryeau, also of the Commit-
tee for Prison Reform-Vibrations
II, described his organization as
“a broad based group of citizens
right here in Pittsburgh who are
concerned with prison reform
and who didn't wait until Attica
to mobilize. “ l

Puryeau outlined an awareness
of what. is happening in prisons
today and the development of
a humane society as goals of his
organization. ’

After describing the needs of
prisoners, he directed concerned
people to create an alternative
to_the present situation.Puryeau

,,/,.'

 

said, “We must become concern-
ed people, who will act to put
an end. to the inhumaneco1)di-
tions in which we find friends,
relatives, and other human be-
ings.”

Curtiss Porter, Associate 'Dir-
ector of the Black Studies De-
partment, characterized the black
as seen by ‘American society as
having “no right, no reason to

want proper food, clothing, and-

shelter. ” _ -

According to Porter, -prisoners
were denied these essentials, and

all 28 prison reforms introduced
at Attica were concerned with
these basics. He reminded the
group that “there can be no hum-
anity in death if there is no re-

spect in life.” _

_Forbes Debate Looms

by BILL GORMLEY
I Editor _

The General State Authority
may be breathing heavilydown
the University’s neck, but it
will probably not desert the
University in its hour of need.

Although the GSA is urging the
speedy development of the Forbes
Field area, it does not intend to
"scuttle the project” if the go-
ing gets rough.‘ _ .

GSA will abandon its plans to con-
struct a Law School, a School of
Education, and’ a Social Science
complex in the Forbes Field area,
if negotiations between the Uni-
versity and the community drag
on and on. ‘

According to Charles Blum, Dep-
uty Executive Director of the GSA,
that‘ fear is unfoui1ded—“a foolish
worry.” - ’

Administrative allusions to GSA

impatience are not groundless,

“An indefinite delay cannot be tol-
erated,” Blum admits. The GSA,
the state’s borrowing and building,

agency, is currently paying a_rchi- H

tects idled by the Forbes delay
$10,000 per week. Should the GSA
run out of money, it would be
obliged to ask the State Legislature
for more.

According to Blum, the state is
losing $85,000 per week because
of the delay. Thus, the Legislature
might frown on an additional allo-
cation, if no end is in sight. And,
Blum explains, the GSA “will fol-

Term Paper Firm  

by JUDY DECKER
A fledgiling firm that dealt in the

sale of’ old and new term papers‘

has been closed down.

The shut down of the operation.

occurred when the landlord who
was renting the company office
space discovered that the firm;
called Term Paper Exchange,
existed. The landlord, who wished
to remain anonymous, said that
the company had been operating
under a false name. When she be-
came aware of the true nature of
the business, she immediately
took stepsito have the company
closed down, believing such a
business “completely unethical."

Before its departure from the
Pittsburgh business world, the
Term Paper Exchange had adver-
tised on campus in the form of
flyers. One such flyer read, “High
‘quality papers are available on
all topics for $2.00 a page. New
papers can be written from
scratch upon request for $3.00 per
page. We buy "quality papers
(quick appraisals — immediate
cash), and there is a discount on
trade-ins.”

The term papers that are sold

by the‘ firm, according to the

firms Pittsburgh manager cover-
ed many topics. If a topic is very
specific, a new paper must , be
written and the company requires
four days advance notice.

The company‘ does not guaran-
tee any.spe_cific grade on. its con-

/3

traband papers but is.willing to
revise any area in the paper that
the buyer does not like.

The term papers that are writ-
ten from scratch are authored, ac-
cording to the manager, by grad-
uate assistants, and professors
from colleges in the area of the
branch office.

When asked whether he consi-
dered his business ethical, the
manager replied, “This type of
thing goes on anyway. We esti-
mate that in an average class, 15
per cent of the students turn in
papers that aren’t their own work.
The papers from this franchise
make up only one per cent of that
total. Fraternities are notorious
for this kind of thing and no one
ever says anything to them. But
ours is a very open business, so."

Dean Jerome Rosenberg of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences call-
ed the practice "immoral and a
violation of academic regula-
tions."

. “If a student is discovered us-
ing such a service," said Rosen-
berg, “he could go before the
Academic Integrity Review
Board, which deals with cases of
plagiarism, which this most cer-
tainly is. The student could be
suspended, penalized in grade or
many other actions can be taken
against him."

The Pittsburgh office of the
Term Paper Exchange was a
branch "of the Boston-based firm.

\'

low the directions given it by the
Legislature and the Governor."

The GSA is clearly interested in
an early solution. “The state is be-
coming very testy,”‘ Vice Chancel-
lor Bernard _Kobosky observes.

But, according to Blum, the GSA is '

as committed to community in-
put in the‘ University’s expansion
plans as to a quick resolution, of
the University’s disagreements
with the community.

And the price. of * community
participation may be a delay that
costs the state money, perhaps
less than $85,000 per week, consi-
dered a specious estimate by Peo-
ple’s Oakland. I

Although Kobosky, the chief ne-

gotiator for the University in the '

dispute, is anxious for a speedy
solution, he is also convinced the
University must carry out its July
28 pledge to plan with the com-

.munity before developing the

Forbes area.

“The University has a tremen-
dous needifor new facilities,” Ko-

bosky declared, adding that the .

Law School is particularly “in

very serious difficulty.”

But Kobosky believes the Univer-
sity must keep its commitment. “I_
don’t think we can say, ‘Damn the
Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead.’
There has to be a common agree-
ment among the ‘parties before
anything is done.”

‘Chancellor Wesley Posvar, while
professing support for the “agree-
ment to participate with the __com-
munity,” is more vocal in his de-
fense of the University‘s need to
build. Moreover, he believes the
University should press for'the
approval of its original Forbes

Sept. 22, 

Phase I proposal, already‘ deemed”

 

->.

..; '

 

unacceptable by People's Oakland. ‘ ‘

“It is my view that the structure a J; 
that has been designed ought to be .  ’
considered as a viable alterna_- ’ I ' '

tive," Posvar said Friday. “Sever-' ’

al million dollars of planningef-: "

fort has gone into that structure.”

Posvar also said that the proposal   ‘‘

,..

was drawn up by “faculty, stu-._'“

dents, and members of thecom-..

munity. ”

Should the University advance  
its Phase I proposal, it will un- ..
doubtedly draw flak from Peoplefs, ‘

Oakland, which could view such a

_ posture as tantamount to a broken ,A, ',
promise. “I think it would be 3'1‘
 shocking, if unsurprising traves-

ty,” Kim Fellnger of People’s 

land argued. “Phase I is suppos’e'd,_,-;~
its . .

to be no longer in existence in
present form.” ‘ .

Fellner, who believes the Univ,er’°

sity should start from scratch

drawing up‘ its plans, complain-_l'-=1
ed that “the University has no idea I 
‘ what joint planning is and’really-  ‘ ',

doesn't want to find out.”

Looming in. the background is 
the city of Pittsburgh, which re-_".'_.7 .
fuses to countenance the construe-’ '7',  ,.

‘ tion of University buildings in the "

Forbes area without provisions for

\..

    
 
  

the University to provide the city ”

with revenue.
According to Robert Paternoster

of the City Planning Commission,- 

a city wide moratorium on the ex-

pansion of all tax-exempt institu- 

tions applies to the Forbes Field A i 
area, since some University'-'ac'- 
quisitions there were made after . .-

December 4, 1970, when the city’s ‘-

policy‘ was implemented.

“Mayor Flaherty wants some

kind of donation from the Univer-
sity," Kobosky explained.Kobosky

believes Flaherty and Posvar  
might iron out the differences 

between the city and the Universi-
ty, if a tete-a-tete is arranged. _

The University and the GSA both
favor community involvement and

the speedy development of the ' .V 
Forbes area. But a choice must be Tl . " 

made if the University is indeed to j

be a “good neighbor,” as Kobosky; ,’  1:’

believes it must, it will have to "

sacrifice haste for harmony.

I Community Involvement Stressed  

lilack Studies Marks Third Year  

by SUE HOENSTINE

The Black Studies department
is embarking on its third year

. in its efforts to. ﬁprotect the fu-

ture for black people.“ as Asso-
ciate Director Curtiss Porter put
it. ~ ’

Besides offering 43 courses to
University students. the depart-

Black Studies

ment fosters involvement in the‘

black community.

Jack Daniel, department dir-‘

ector, said that the Black Stu-
dies program “is concerned with
having a sound academic base,
but at the same time it is equal-
ly interested in community edu-
cational programs.” He said that
the department has achieved
“about 10 per cent of our goals.”

Daniel explained that Black
Studies courses require some
community involvement or field

--work. For example, the depart-

ment has established a child de-
velopment center in Homewood.
Pre-school children learn prob-
lem solving and methods of cop-
ing with their environment at

' the center. About 20 Pitt students

per term do field work at the cen-
ter in conjunction with Black
Studies 137. "

The department is also involv-
ed in developing educational
courses with credit for inmates
at Western State Penitentiary.
Presently Clarence Turner is
teaching Black Studies 135: Black
Social and Political Thought, to
25 inmates at the Penitentiary.

An invitation to participate in .
Black Studies classes free of '

charge and with no credit has
also been extended to all mem-
bers of the black community.

“Community people have sat
in on almost every course we‘ve
taught," Daniel said.

Now the Department is hoping
to offer night classes in the
School of General" Studies and

is planning a graduate program -

for 1972 or 1973. ‘

Twenty-seven to 30 credits are
required for a Black Studies ma-
jor, and the three possible fields
of concentration are Arts and Lit-
erature, Black Social Science, and
African World Studies.

‘‘All educated people should be

aware of the black experience,”

_said Porter, who concluded that

"no department ‘should offer a
degree in a relative major with-
out requiring Black Studies
courses.”

Four students are part of the
departments work-study program
and assist the faculty in research
concerning the black family,
Pan-Africanism, Afro-American
Folklore, Dance and Expression,
and Ethnography. '

“This department is now in the
process of establishing a series of
courses related to the Carib-

bean,” Daniel said. "He and Por-
ter emphasized that this area "is
vitally important since it is a
source of black culture.

stitute of Cross-Cultural Ex-

year nine Pitt students studied
culture and language at the Uni-
versity of Ife, Nigeria for ten
months. Four students from Ife
are now at Pitt as part of the
cross-cultural exchange. ‘

According to Daniel. Black
Studies next fall hopes to “open
its doors to the first Community
Institute in either the Hill Dis-
trict, Homewood. or the -North
Side. -

“The Institute will most likely
be for high school students, and
should radically change the
definition of a high school,“
Daniel said.

A medical emergency loan
fund=is being made available to
all full time undergraduates
who find that theyjcannot meet
the cost of needed medical care. ’

The fund, set up by the Health
Services Organization (HSO) of
the Student Association, Wlll
grant loans up to and including
$100 provided that the loan re-
quest is accompanied by a sign-
ed statement by a physician as
proof that theistudent is in need
of medical care.

Marc Hiller of the HSO ex-
plained that the physicians‘ state-
ment is required to prevent mis-
use of the limited fund.

In order to insure that the re-
cords are kept confidential, the
HSO does not wish to know the
students reason for requesting a
loan. The doctor’s statement will
assure them that the reason is
legitimate.

There is no interest charge for

the first year of the loan. If it '

has not been-repaid by this time
a six per cent interest charge will
be levied.

The service has been in the
works for a year and a half. ac-
cording to Hiller. Numerous ad-
ministrative snags,he said, had
to" be ‘overcome and skeptical
administrators had to be convinc-
ed of the viability of the plan.

sincerity of the student body,

off the Establishment, though
they still put His picture onithe
covers of their magazines.

John Palafoutas, head of the
Pitt Christian Fellowship, re-

gards the so-called Jesus Freaks

with slight disdain, though. as
a good Christian. he is unhappy
that he is disdainful.

“I view them with caution,“ he ,

says. "I don’t want to criticize
them,,but there are a lot of them
who are just on a trip."

We are eating lunch at the—

Pittsburgh Power and Light,
which «I thought was a subsidiary
of a utility company. But it isn‘t.
When its potential is realized, it
will be a kind of one-building
shopping center where people,

_not necessarily Christians, will

be able to purchase goals and
services at costs u_nswelled by
commercial mark-ups.

The place now serves as a kind
of club house for youthful Chris-
tians hosting Friday-night so-‘
cials. It also serves lunch, a king-
size hamburger called The Pow-
erburger. Signs in the Power and
Light offer guitar lessons, three
free illegitimate kittens, and
“The Daily Return of the Super-
fresh,” a donut. Surprisingly
enough, half the people eating

lunch wear suits and ties. The‘

place is attracting a lot of busi-
nessmen, who with their lunch
money -.help keep the place sol-
vent.

A Christian for 11 years,'Pala-

origins of the campus religion

“Some of it,” he says, “is just

_in'reaction to what our culture

does to us."

Religion has meant a great

measured and thoughtful, and it
is obvious that he has devoted

It maybe, as _John Palafoutas
believes, that the" alternatives of-
fered by a secular society frus-

trate today’s youth. In that case. ,

religion may be one of the -par-
allel paths — drugs, devil wor-

ship, insanity-traveled by the dis-

affected.

Doug, a senior math major at
Pitt, is the son of a Presbyterian
‘Minister. He turned to Christian-
ity when the world posed ques-
tions he cou1dn’t‘answer.

"‘Things," he says-, “didn't al-
ways make a whole lot of sense.
I started to ask myself where am
Igoing,’what am I here for.”

For Bob Long, religion has
been a habit for years. When he
played end for the Pitt Panthers
in the early ’60s, he belonged

to the Fellowship of Christian"

Athletes. Since‘ then he has work-
ed in the Lower East Side and
Harlem areas of New York._To-
day, he is the Associate Minister
of the Bellefield Presbyterian
Church. —’

“I saw the Church here,’ says
Long, “as being in an unbeliev-
ably strategic point. Right across

-the street from the University,

Carnegie-Mellon down the street,
four hospitals in the area. Then

‘there’s the Hill district and two
black high schools. ‘There aren‘t
many churches in ,-the United
States that have the opportunities
this one has." -

To most people, they are dis-

tant problems; ghettoes, hippies,.

urben blight. To Long. they are
opportunities, and therein lies
a crucial factor in Christianity's
revitalized call to youth. Today's
youth are activists — any reli-
gion that would tempt them must
shed its skin and lunge at socie-
ty's problems.

that there are no blacks among

looking forward to initiating tu-

 Judge Martin Cites Need

by PATRICK A. TIERNEY, JR.
‘Judge Edward J. Martin of the

W Court of Common Pleas declared

here that the need to alter the

 present court system represents
:. the major area of concern f'or
O judges today.

In his address, Martin a candid

ate for election to the Court, cit-
ed the absence of an efficient
penal code, the overcrowded-

''ness in our courts, and the ap-

parent false classification of cer-

tain offenses under his Court’s

jurisdiction as evidence for the
need to change.

The Court of Common Pleas,
comprised of 41 judges, handles
all jury trials for the Common-
wealth. Martin, a Republican, is

, one of seven candidates for the
four positions open on the court.

.He was appointed to the judge-

R ship in March of I970.

Martin said that the courts are

— presently waiting t'or the State

Legislature to approve a much

" more extensive penal code.

.   Court Reforms Urged

ue expressed ms support for
the new code saying, “It would
get rid of archaic laws, it would
define and clarify laws we do
need, and would, hopefully, set
forward some sentencing guide
for the judges.” He attached
special importance to the latter.

Martin stated that help is
needed on two levels to relive
the present backlog of cases in
the courts,help on both an admin-
istrative level. and ion a legal
level.

.He predicted that use of data
processing units will become
more widespread as people learn
that these units can decrease the
amount of paperwork needed
for the court.

On the legal side, he urged
that legislators re-classify some
misdemeanor offenses as sum-
mary offences. Because sum-
mary offenses are handled by
lower courts, he said, some of the
congestion could then be reliev-
ed from the trial courts.

He stated that of the 10,000

mon Pleas during the year end-,

ingJune, 1970, no less than 2,500
were violations he thought could

have been handled on a lower.

magistrate level.

Martin lamented the lack of
"activism" among present judg-
es. But he qualified this by say-
ing that the overcrowded situa-
tion forces many judges to spend
too much time on the non-essen-
tial parts of their jobs.

“The purpose of the paper,“
explained Wilborn, “is to bring
together black ideas and acti-
vities on campus and in the com-
munity." Wilborn emphasized
that the paper will differ fr.om
the original. by containing much
more informative content. “The
first paper contained too much
rhetoric,” Wilborn said. A

When asked if a purpose of the
paper would be to help communi-
cations between black and white
on campus, Wilborn

not a major purpose, but it would
be great if it did.”

the teacher serves the student.

This revolutionary educational
method will be undertaken and
explored beginning Saturday,
Sept. 25. An Open Classroom

Interested students are being

Program advisor Dr. David N.
Campbell of the Foundations of
Education Department reports
that the program has _two set
goals. “We want to show students
that they can learn without be-
ing coerced and to offer a real
alternative to what is available in
public schools.”

Secondly, the program aims
to show future teachers how to
work in this new type of class-
room atmosphere which is rapid-
ly being incorporated into many
school systems. . -

Open classrooms attempt to
develop students as individuals,
not to mold them into confor-
mity. The student takes the ini-
tiative of choosing subject ma-
terial for study, not the teacher.
"It is the teacher’s responsibility
to create an educational envir-
onment which allows the student
to build and expand his inter-
ests," said Campbell.

The teacher is stripped of his
authority and power and func-
tions as a reference source and
stimulator of new ideas. A good
teacher is not measured by his
degrees, his administrators or the
State Board of Education, but by
the students he teaches. .

Students are on a first name
basis with their teachers and an
open, honest relationship should
develop. Grading, hall passes,
time schedules; all of the old
ways of _forcing students into do-
cility and conformity are abol-
ished.

Open classrooms do not aim to
teach specific facts to a student,
rather they teach him tovlearn
whatever he feels he needs to
know to achieve his goals. The
desired product is an individual
capable of investigating his own
interests with enough flexibility
to pick up any subject.

According to Campbell, “The
truly open classroom destroys hy-

, pocrisy, lying and flattering, for

threats, fear, anxietyand con-
formity have no value. One is
there to learn, to teach, to exper-
ience, to attempt to understand
the ideas and beliefs of others.”

The program will be initiated
in three steps, the first being the
pairing of students with volun-
teer teachers interested in the
same or related fields.
teers from organizations such as

Placement -Aids Job

by TIM LUDDY

Are you one of the growing
number of college seniors who
will’ soon be faced withthe pros-
pect of job—hunting in a mark-
et where shortages of good jobs
are greater every year? Have in-
sufficient funds made a part-time
job necessary? Are you thinking
about a summer job to help you
pay the rising costs of a college
education?

If you find yourself in any of

‘ these situations, a visit to Pitt‘s

Job Placement Service may be
in order. Located in room 219 Stu-

Interest in subjects will be
stimulated by the teachers in
various ways._ For instance. one
girl who intends to organize a
group studying biology will
bring a terrarium and aquarium
complete with fish and snakes to
gather her interest group.

Interest groups in areas such
as cooking, racing, radio opera-
tion, music, acting, and arts and
crafts are anticipated. Other
groups will be created to suit
the interests of the students.

The program will last for the

tact representatives of national
companies to discover the avail-
able job opportunities in their re-
spective fields.

It is also open to alumni, and
students wishing summer jobs.
Information is also available in

along with her insistence on pros-
cenium staging where there isn’t
one at all, takes a show that is to
be sharp, clear, and well-timed
and creates a slightly dull but us-
ually “just uninspiring" piece of
musical comedy.

It is a slow, metronomic beat
that causes The Fantasticks to
ooze forth slowly and sometimes
painfully as the scenes roll by-
one after the other—like a half-
cranked nickelodeon.

Fortunately for the Studio The-

_ atre, however, most of those who

fill the roles have enough talent
and inspiration to make The Fan-
tasticks enjoyable——though no one
who must both sing and act can do
them equally well. -

The most superior performance
is given by one of the University’s
most talented actors, Tom Spin-
ella. As the Old Actor, Spinella
gives a somewhat different in-
terpretation than most who have
taken this part and carries it off

At Metronomic Pace

so well that his performance is
an outstanding one.

Jim Kraus’ Mortimer is very
well-timed and in a largely physi-
cal role, maintains a consistent
and exceedingly entertaining
characterization. Walt Cramer,
as the Narrator (El Gallo), is
very capable of handling the mu-
sic on most occasions and his act-
ing is soft and gentle as is his de-
livery of the musical score. How-
ever, he is largely mis-cast in
the bold dashing deep-throated
role of the bandit.

The lull in the Panther football action is now past. On
Saturday afternoon, the gridders will face the challenge of
containing one of the best running teams in the country, the
Oklahoma Sooners. The outcome of the game will be a
strong indicator to the Panther’s fortunes this fall season.

Oklahoma, ranked in the top ten by both wire services,
comes to the Stadium after an impressive 30-0 mauling of A
Southern Methodist University. They gained close to 400
yards in .total offense, with most of it coming on the
ground. ‘ ’

Saturday’s game will mark the first time that a Pitt
defense must cope with the vaunted Wishbone—T system.
The formation, adapted by Texas’ Darrell Royal from a
Texas high school coach, has proved quite successful for
the Sooners. Last year, they totalled close to 3000 rushing,
with, sophomore back Joe Wylie gaining over a third of
them by himself. -

Besides Wylie, the Sooners are fortunate to have nine
offensive starters returning, with the entire backfield intact.
Quarterback Jack Mildren, who directs the wishbone attack,
is regarded as one of the premier
running signalcallers in the coun-..
try and has attained a fine passing
record during his two previous sea-
sons. - '

Wy'lie’s cohort at the end of the '
"wishbone, Greg Pruitt, is.,'a break-
’ away type of runner‘-as shown by.
his ‘many long dashes last year. In ,

vwhich Oklahoma tied Alabama
24-24.  ‘"2:
Complementing the powerful of- GREG PRU"-T
fense is astingy defense which proved its efficiency against
SMU. Accordingto the Associated Press, SMU managed
topenetrate into Oklahoma territory only oncein the first
half. Twomen‘-the Panther offense will likely have trouble
with are Steve Aycock, middle linebacker, and Ray Hamil-
. ton, defensive end, both all - Big Eight selections.

Two years ago, when Panther Coach Carl‘ DePasqua
‘first arrived at Pitt,’ the Sooners ripped the Panthers in the
second game of the year, 38-8. Mildren, in his second var.-
sity game, raced 78 yards for a score, a‘ personal record for
him which still stands. A

A glance at the freshman roster of the Sooners reminds
me of DePasqua’s statementof empire football schools. Fif-
ty-one- recruits (fifty-one recruits!) gives the Oklahoma
coaches, plenty of maneuverability as opposed to the Pan-
thers’ restriction of twenty-five new players each year.

Though their statistics ‘are awesome, the ‘Sooners are
not unbeatable (we ho'pe).rThe Panthers proved that they
can be tough in their upset win over highly favored UCLA.
They’ll .have to be even tougher to keep their record clean
despite the supposed advantage of being at home.-

A Panther victory or a strong showing against the rug-
ged Sooners could ignite the squad’ for weeks to come. A-
second upset win ‘could, finally signal that the Pantheris
back to national prominence. '

The key to the game will probably lie in how well the
Pitt defense can break the superb running attack of the
wishbone offense. If the Sooners are able to- roll up the
kind of yardage on the ground as they did in past games,
no amount of heroics by the Pitt offense will be able to
match them. a ~ . ‘

Can’t make any bones about that.

Sports Editor . _
Back in the 1800’s when America was largely unsettled, the
territory which is‘now the state of Oklahoma was offered to the
prospective settlers of that time for free. The only requirement
was that you had to stake your claim before anyone else did.

A date was set and the land rush was on. But there existed
at that time, as there exists today people who have a tendency
to jump the gun a bit. In Oklahoma large number of settlers
staked their claims on the then barren territory a few days be-
fore the official departure date and they were subsequently call-
ed the Sooners. ‘

The Oklahoma football team adopted this infamous title for
their football squad.

Now I’m not sure whether the implication there is that the
football team is fast, or that they utilize illegal methods of ob-
taining territory, but I’m inclined to go with the former and dis-
count the latter.

As was certainly evident by the vast number of superlatives

  
   

V‘: - thrown around at the Panther press luncheon on Tuesday, the

Oklahoma Sooners are a fast, quick team that utilizes its speed
to win ball games.

Carl DePasqua, Pitt’s head coach put -it likenthis. “They
have great speed. They don’t have anyone on their defensive

team that doesn’t run 5.0 or under,” pertaining to the 40-yard
dash." ' ' ‘ —

“Offensively, everyone has seen Steve Owens run, well they
have runners that are quicker than Owens,” he continued. ‘
“There is no question in my mind that Oklahoma parallels
the Notre Dames and the Texases in personnel,” DePasqua

added. “They have 37 lettermen returning, 20 of which are
starters.” ' '

And, so the story goes on and on. Mildren, Wylie, Pruitt and

Crosswhite each boast their own set of exceptional statistics. 4

Where that leaves Pitt is questionable.

Coach Chuck Fairbanks, a man who has accumulated 29
victories in the four years at OU is far from discounting the
Panthers, especially after what they did to the UCLA Bruins.

“I’m very impressed ‘with their team,” Fairbanks said. “I

-made a comparison between the 1969 Pitt team when they played

us here and this year’s team and I’m impressed with the ath-
letic ability of their overall squad.”

Fairbanks also cites the fact that his squad has not yet been
tested against a physically strong team. Southern Methodist,
whofell to the Sooners, 30-0, is a small squad. ' - I ‘

But the “ifs” don’t discount the fact that Oklahoma is the

11th ranked team in the country certainly making the Sooner
the better.

by VINCE DiNARDO

From 1938 until last year. Don
Molleneauer. was a teacher at
Mt. Lebanon High School. in Mt.
Lebanon. During the day, he
would teach economics and his-
tory and in the evening he be-
came one of the most success-
ful high_ school track coaches
in the country.

After the-1969 season the strain
of both teacher and coach be-
came too much for him. Then,
when coach Jim Banner’s assis-
tant, Don Shaw, left Pitt last
year to become head coach at
his alma mater, Banner had to
find someone else as his assis-
tant. ‘

Banner, however, didn't have
to look very far to find Mollen-
eauer. In fact, he had only to
look one block from his home on
Cedar Avenue in Mt. Lebanon to
discover Shaw’s replacement. ,

“I had two more years to go
before I could collect my retire-
ment pay at Mt. Lebanon,” Mol-
leneauer said, “but when coach
Banner gave me the opportun-
ity to come here, I thought about
it and took it.”

After track practice Mollen-
eauer still had his teaching dut-
ies to attend to. Teaching two
subjects‘ often meant a lot of
paperwork for him.

“All that work often left me
ex-hausted,”he continued. “But,
with no teaching here the pres-

7

sure is much less.‘ -

During Don’s tenure as the
Mt. Lebanon ‘coach, he accumu-
lated both powerful credentials
and community gratification.

In his 31 years as. coach there,
he never had a losing season.
Molleneauer’s athletes didn’t
lose a dual or a Triangle meet

" from 1944 to 1963. The nineteen

year old winning streak, the
longest in the country, produced
144 consecutive wins without a
defeat.

Also, Molleneauer’s te a m s
brought home 15 WPIAL track
championships and 15 WPIAL
Cross country championships.
That’s_ 30 championships in 31
years of coaching. Not bad at
all.

Mt. Lebanon appreciated his
efforts also.

In 1956, the residents of that
community sent up a fund and
raised enough‘ money to send
Molleneauer to Melborne Aus-

tralia to watch the Olympics.

“It was their way of showing
their appreciation,” reminisced
the coach.

Because they are neighbors,
Molleneauer and Banner often
come to Pitt in the same car.

“Unless one of us has some-

thing to do that evening, only

‘llllllllllllllllll Ca]]];[1‘O lllllllllllllll

ed by the attitudeand condition of
the work.

Strube said, “I was in love with
the car the first time I saw it.
Since I started only Sunday at the
track. I didn‘t think I would get
a chance to workon it so soon. "

He said this after he and three
other members had just removed
the engine from the Camaro in
less than an hour and a half.

"I had just a little experience.

working on my own car." he con_-
tinued. “But they show me what
to do and I just do it. If I have'any
questions I just ask." '

Banner Believes In

“ “Love Thy Neighbor’

one of us will drive,” Mollen-
eauer said. “Jim and I work
close together. Our theories on
coaching and training are simi-
lar.

“Here at Pitt, I have been hea-
vily involved in recruiting in
the local Western Pennsylvania
area. Jim takes care of the re-
cruiting elswhere. Also, I take
care of the runners, while he
takes care of the detailed work."

The experience that" Mollen-
eauer has in this area has to
give_ him a definite positive ef-
fect on his recruiting. And of
course Pitt benefits by it. It's

Molleneauer to help build a win-
ning image for the Pitt track
team (Banner has some stagger-
ing credentials of his own), but
after all, it only stands to reason
that two coaches that have simi-
lar theories, drive _to work toge-
ther, and coach together are
bound to remain good neighbors
through it all.

Freshmen Prime For

WVU Little Mounties

The Pitt freshman football team
clashes with the Little Moun-

taineers of West Virginia this.

Saturday at 8:15 p.m.at Ambridge
High School.

WVU's head football coach.
Bobby Bowden, seems quite sat-
isfied with the players recruited
for the '71 freshman campaign.

“We are real pleased with the
boys we have recruited for the
1971 freshman team." stated
Bowden.

“We feel we have recruited_

people with more growth poten-
tial than in previous years and at
the same time we don’t feel we
have sacrificed too much agil-
ity,” Bowden said of freshman

. coach, Joe Pendry’s Little Moun-

ties.

‘Defensive tackle, John Adams.
from Bethesda, Maryland is an
example of this. According to
WVLI Coaches, Adams
has both the size (6 - 6, 260
pounds) and the speed (5.0 sec-
onds over 40 yds.) to be a great
football player for ‘West Virgin-
ia.

When you're typing the big one, the 30-page
paper you've been sweating for weeks, that's when
mistakes bug you the most. 80 you slow down-
And the closer you get to the bottom of the page.
the more you clutch up. Mess up now and you've
got a whole page to retype. _ '

When you've got a slipstick handy, you don't
worry about mistakes. One easy touch releases a
special fluid that buries the mistake and leaves a

- clean new surface like the paper itself.

So you type relaxed. And maketewer mistakes.
On the big assignments, Liquid Paper's new slip-
stick could put you days ahead.
