 T h e P itt - P e n n State Rivalry

‘Revenge

Bowl Bound Panthers

Travel To Happy Valley

By BARRY ZASLOFF

There was so much they
could’ve talked about: The 52-6
victory over Rutgers that took
place, moments earlier. The
Cotton Bowl bid that had just
been extended to them, while
their coach was being fitted for
“one of those southern cowboy

hats. The fact that they can real-

istically talk again about a
national‘ championship.

Taking precedence over all
this in the Pitt locker room last
Saturday was, of course, this
Friday’s war against Penn State
at University Park. A sign in
quarterback Dan Marino’s stall
told the story: “48-14." The
thrashing that the Lions put on
Pitt nearly one year ago was
being relived by many Pitt
players. - '

For Pitt, it was a nightmare

peared from Pitt Stadium by
day’s end. The season, which
up until that cold, dreary after-
noon had been an incredible
success, crumbled into tiny
pieces.

While that season will forever
remain parted for the partici—
pants, there is a small measure
of revenge that can be gained by
Pitt. The teams have remained
the same, but the roles have
been switched.

This year, Penn State needs a
win over Pitt and then Georgia
in the Sugar Bowl to win the
national championship. Last
year, the Panthers needed a vic-
tory over the Lions and then the
Bulldogs in that same bowl.

Still, Pitt Coach Foge Fazio
refuses to connect the dots. “I
don’t see the roles as being re-
versed,” he said. “Penn State

has the same things going into
the game as we do. We'll both be

  Conflict Did Not Involve

Iraq Students, Some Say

By PEGGY FERRI

Campus police are investigating
the national affiliations of the for-
eign student groups involved in
this weekend’s confrontation
caused by the Islamic Union of
Iraqi Students’ attempt to hold a
meeting in the Forbes Quadrangle
to discuss the Islamic revolution in
Iraq.

The conflict, formerly thought
to be between two different factions
of Iraqi students, was actually
between Iraqis and Iranians who
were misrepresenting themselves
as Iraquis, according to Pitt Iraqi
student Luay Almasrif.

Concerning local press coverage
incident, Almasrif chal-
lenged anyone to “show any docu-
ment that would prove that there
was a single Iraqi” in the student
group that identified itself as Iraqi.

“The group (Iranians) that came
to the meeting was not from
around here; they came in vans
with Ohio plates on them,” Almas-
rif said.

Campus police have as yet been
unable to determine who
assembled the group of students
from Ohio, to Assistant Director of
Campus Police James Waiters.

Two persons were injured and
two were arrested in the Saturday
clash between the groups. Moham-

med Abdul-Kareem from Toledo,
Ohio has been charged with aggra-
vated assault after_ knifing a Pitt
student in the chin.

The student, Ali Kadier received
hospital treatment. Kadier said
that the group from Ohio is Iran-
ian and challenged them to show
their passports, but he says that not
one of them could. In addition,
Kadier said that when he questi-
oned the Iranians outside the
Quad, they could not understand
his Arabic.

“Iranians can’t understand

Mon- Wed-Fri-Sat
Tues & _Thurs

Arabic,” Kadier explained.

Kadier said he was surprised to
see the ad for the meeting in The
Pitt News (Friday, Nov. 19) and
went to the activity to find out
more about it and who made the
reservation for this group to come
to Pitt.

The ad said that “A meeting will
be held by the Islamic Union of
Iraqi Students about the Islamic
revolution in Iraq and the struggle
of the Muslin Iraqi people against
the dictatorship of Saddam Al
Tikriti.”

The ad however, did not name
the program sponsor and that has
caused some problems.

Room reservation policy stipu-
lates that it must be clear which
university group is sponsoring an
activity and that they must identify
themselves in the ad.

According to Director of Student
Activities Andy Smith, the ad was
not illegal, but the fact that the
sponsoring group did not identify
itself is a violation of policy.

"We have contacted the Muslin
Student Organization which spon-
sored the activity and discussed the
issue with them,” Smith said.
“This (the ad) is a technical viola-
tion of the policy——but not usually
serious." _

Smith said that he considers it
appropriate to look over ads before
groups take them to The Pitt News
business offices, because the organ-
izations are using university space.

“To ensure the safety of the stu-
dents who attend these programs, it
is appropriate to review these ads to
see that they don’t contain any
inflammatory language,” Smith
said. “I don’t have any problems
with the actual content of the
program.”

The question of which groups
should have their ads reviewed is a
question that will be settled on a

case-by-case basis, according to
Smith. He added that he saw no
indication that the ad placed bv the
Muslim Student Organization
(MSO) was a deliberate misrepre-
sentation. “They probably did not
fully understand the policies and
made a mistake,” Smith said.

MSO advisor Adrian A. Shakhs
said that the organization came to
him to ask for his signature on the
ad contract and added that he will
be meeting soon with the Student
Activities Office to discuss the uni-
versity’s reservation policy.

The MSO was unable to be
reached for comment because it has
not filled out an information care
with the Student Government.

Shakhs said that he does not
agree-with claims that the group of
Iraquis was actually a group of
Iranians.

“The claim, however, that there
were Iraqi secret police there (pres-
ent at the meeting) is one that fits
the pattern of this (the Iraqi)
regime," Shakhs said.

He said that he cannot under‘-
stand why it could not be that the
pro—Ayatollah Khomeini group
and the other group were Iraqi,
because there “is opposition in any
country.”

The Islamic Union of Iraqi Stu-
dents, that was to hold the meeting,
is a local group, according to
Shakhs. He said, however, that he
could not reveal any of their identi-
ties because “the Iraqi government
would punish their families at
home.”

In the wake of Saturday’s con-
frontation, the campus police will
be careful to see that the same thing
does not happen again.

Waiters said that he is pleased
that the police actions led to a swift
resolution of the conflict and added
that the police will continue to be
sensitive to these kinds of seminars.

~ credits at Pitt, the Department

Council Raises Non-CAS)
Credit Requirements "

“This is one/of the big head-
aches in my office," Schulman
said.

He said that although the 12-
credit limit is a common one,
other universities have varia-
tions of it.

The University of Michigan,
for example, permits student to
take up to 20 credits with the
approval of his advisor and the
University of Illinois allows

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The College of Arts and
Sciences Council raised the
limit on the number of credits a
student can take in non-CAS
courses that will count towards
their degree at its meeting last
Monday.

The new policy, approved by
an 8-1 vote, will allow CAS stu-
dents to take 18 non—CAS credits
instead of the current limit of
12.

CAS Dean Irwin Schulmaii
said the new rule will take effect
next semester.

The motion was 21 result of
two separate proposals on the
subject:

The School of Library and
liiforination Sciences proposed
raising the limit for CAS stu-
dents to take more courses in
another school in order to learn
a substaiitial amount of a sub-
ject without rnajoring in it.

The l)usiIiess department
also asked to raise the lirriit in
accordaiice with their dual
major prograrri, in which a stu-
dent cari combine business with
another major.

The new policy will be -help-
ful to students who want to take
more business credits and stu-
dents who transfer from
another college and find that
they lose many of their business

‘CAS credits towards a CAS
degree. _

Some concern was expressed
that a low limit often forces a
student to choose between CAS
and another school, thus possi-
l)ly lowering CAS enrollment.

“I think it sounds like a
wonderful idea not to have any
limit at all,” said professor
lingerie Engels of the physics
(lepartiiient, “if you didn't have
this hang—up about students
taking non-CAS courses."

Schulman said that 18 is a
reasorial)le figure and there will
probably be no need to alter that
number.

“My own view is that in the
past we were in a situation
where outside the major a stri-
dent could do anything he
wanted,” he said. “It will still
be a little bit of a cramp on the
student, but I think I8 is a rea-
sonable number.”

“We have to be more flexible
than we’ve been.”

Considering the pay gap
betweeen men and women, it pays
to be a man. Women earn 59¢ for
every male-earned dollar, and
minority women earn an even
lower 55¢ for every dollar earned by
men, according to Dale R. New-
man, a labor historian and vice-
president of the North Hills
chapter of the National Organiza-

.. ’" .:-ion for Women (NOW).

In a lecture yesterday morning at
Point Park College, Newman, who
is also a doctoral candidate at the
University of Pittsburgh, said that
even the best educated women are
disadvantaged by sex dis-
crimination.

A 198l -Harvard study found that
male graduates of Harvard’s
School of Education averaged
$26,150 per year, while females
with the same degree averaged
$18,700.

‘The Equal Pay Act of 1963
essentially protects, or should pro-
tect, women only when they are

, performing work that is equal to or

"virtually indistinguishable from
work performed by men," New-
man said.

However, the law is being blat-
antly violated, and few women are
able to achieve work that is equal
or indistinguishable from males.
The majority of women work in
sex segregated areas.

Of the women in this nation’s
workforce, 80 percent work in posi-
tions viewed as strictly women’s
work. Females comprise 80 percent
of the clerical force, of which 99.5
percent are secretaries, and 96 per-
cent of the clerical force, of which
99.5 percent are secretaries, and 96
percent of the nation’s registered

” "*4 nurses.

“Women are concentrated in
only 20 of the over 420 occupations
identified in the ‘Dictionary of
Occupational Titles,’ ” Newman
said.

In fact, the Equal Pay Act may
have encouraged employers to
segregate female employees’ posi-
tions from those of their male
counterparts’ to avoid prosecution
under the act.

The Pitt News, Wednesday November 24, 1982

Women Suffer Pay Gap

“The percentage of female bank
tellers increased from 73.6 to 92.9 in
the last decade, but the teller’s job
became a dead end rather than a
means of upward mobility,” New-
man said.

The consequences to women of
job segregation are threefold: fewer
job training opportunities, fewer
advancement possibilities and
lower salary and wage potential.

Regarding advancement possi-
bilities, Newman said that female
employment, discriminating in the
initial level of the woman’s assign-
ment or restricting a woman's
opportunity for promotion.

Women have lower salary and
wage potential frequently because
they are employed in areas of
“women’s work.”

For example, a liquor clerk in
Montgomery County, Md. earned

~ more than a school teacher with

two years experience and a college
degree. Municipal tree-trimmers in
Denver are paid more than nurses
who work in the city’s intensive
care unit.

Since Reagan took office, New-
man said cutbacks in the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission's Affirmative Actions
budget have been “horrendous.”

The backlog of cases involving
women’s employment discrimina-
tion is a direct result of staff cut-
backs. There is a two-year waiting
list for Affirmative Action services.

“With Carter, changes were
being made,” she said. Reagan has
shown a failure to enforce current
laws, has placed a freeze on pro-
posed new legislation and has
assisted in the erosion of these
agencies,” Newman said.

The cost, in 1980, for the mainte-
nance of the EEOC budget was $1
per worker.

“They got a lot accomplished for
that little amount of payment,"
Newman said.

With the resources of
discriminated-against females
dwindling, a powerful, low-profile
group in Washington that lobbies
for employer interests is still going
strong.

Mark Fuhrman an.J. Meyer lead tat lat night's pep rly in Pitt tadlum.

Despite the tense rivalry between Pitt and Penn State, the rally was poorly attended.

The Equal Employment Advi-
sory Council, whose membership
is kept secret, has come out aginst
equity in pay and employment for
women since 1980. The executive
board consists of officials from
General Electric, Sears, General
Motors, Prudential, the Rubber
Manufacturers Association and
Edison Electric, many of whom
have been defendants in suits
brought against them by the
EEOC.

“The council claims that wages
are set by the market, by the laws of
supply and demand,” Newman
said. “Well, the market has failed
women miserably.”

She cites as an example the cur-
rent nursing shortage. St. Luke’s
hospital in Missouri, when faced

with a short supply of nurses, asked
the federal government for and
received special importation
exemptions that allowed them to
recruit and hire English, Scottish
and Irish nurses rather than
increase wages to attract more
American nurses.

Newman said, “We must learn
that equal pay f()r work of compar-
able value is right and justified. If
discrimination wasn't profitable,
employers wouldn't he doing it.
Should women accept less just
because the system has under-
valued what they do?

“If we can litigate more cases and
extract more payments from
offending employers, then they'll
think twice before they discrimi-
nate against a woman.

Thank You
Very Much

Now comes the time that The Pitt News, in
keeping with the spirit of the upcoming holi-
day, thanks those students, faculty and admin-
istrators for all they’ve done in the past year.

There’s plenty to be thankful for. Here goes:

0 To Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar and pro-
vost Rhoten Smith, for their consideration and
sensitivity toward the students and faculty of
the geography department in making their
decisions to close it;

0 To Andy Smith, for easing the inconven-

' ience of the renovations by patrolling the halls

for stray pencil marks on the unwashable walls;

0 Another to Smith, for removing any char-
acter or charm this building once had and fil-
ling it with beige furniture—--eventually;

! To all the candidates in the Student
Government Board race, first, for treating the
press so kindly on election night, and second,
for treating each other so nicely‘ during the
whole election; S

0 To all those dedicated rock fans, who intel-
ligently and politely responsed to our manag-
ing editor’s columns;

0 To Pitt fraternities, for their openness and
candor about the Bayard Street brawl;

0 To all the local pretzel vendors, for giving
out the cold pretzels on top instead of the hot
ones on the bottom;

0 To 7-1 1, for visibly marking up items and
taking the better part of many students’ loans;

0 To Ronald Reagan, for elevating the
importance of a higher education and making
it even easier for overprivileged students to
attend overrated Ivy League schools;

0 To a liberal arts education, which is a lot of-
fun to talk about while waiting for unemploy-
ment benefits to come in;

C To the English department, for taking over
Gustine’s on Tuesday nights;

0 To the Pitt payroll department, for being
too inefficient to pay people here twice a
month;

0 To Ed Bozik, for his heartfelt concern over
student tickets for away games;

0 To whomever decided to place Pitt’s artistic
university seal on the Student Union lawn,
thereby adding to the aesthetic quality of this
lush campus;

0 And finally, to the Iranian, Iraqi (or wha-
tever nationality they actually were) students
for increasing interest in The Pitt News adver-
tising department.

Outraged At Stereotypes

Dear Editor:

On behalf of the outraged black
community I feel it is necessary to
respond to the article of Wednes-
day, Nov. 17 “The Inside Story: A
Guide to Surveying the Current
Job Crunch.” There really is an
inside story, but it’s not aboutjobs;
it’s about stereotypes and racism. It
is a very clear and subtle message
and if one were not paying atten-
tion to the message it would sneak
right past you and you wouldn’t
even know it.

The article was supposed to
enlighten us on how to prepare for
the job market, interviews and
resumes. What we really learned is
that The Pitt News ostensibly
thinks that it is a place to express its
stereotyped racial views. On page
nine, there is a cartoon drawing of
a black male and female hugging
each other while appearing fright-
ened and confused. Their lips are
large and thick. Their noses are big
and they have huge afros. Also,
their eyes are very big conforming
with the sterotype that when blacks
become afraid their eyes get very

large. But this is only half of the
story.

On page 10, referring to the same
story, there is a picture of a white

‘Black people are
rarely, if ever, drawn
as cartoon characters
in The Pitt News. Why
do you all of a sudden
feel this was an ade-
quate and appropriate
time » to depict blacks
as cartoon charac-
ters?’

female throwing her diploma and
cap in the air while dancing and
smiling. Clearly what The Pitt
News is trying to infer is that blacks
do not know what to do when it is
time to seek a job while white peo-

ple can conquer the job market des-
pite its very dismal outlook. Black
people are rarely, if ever, drawn as
cartoon characters in The Pitt
News. Why do you all of a sudden
feel this was an adequate and
appropriate time to depict blacks
as‘ cartoon character? Perhaps it
would have been understandable if
a black graduate were in the place

of the white graduate. Maybe the, 
the message would have appear ‘ ° 4

as confused freshmen graduating
as confident seniors. But this was
not the case. Furthermore, I am
appalled that The Pitt News would
allow something like this to be
printed. Where is your integrity?
Hasn’t The Pitt News and some of
its writers been the center of
enough controversy?

Your cartoon has many people
furious and has caused your news-
paper to lose even more respect
from the black community. We feel
that you owe us an apology, expla-
nation or both.

Slurvian Language

Dear Editor:

After readingithe article of
Wednesday, Nov. 17, “Prof
Analyzes How Yuns Talk,” I
felt compelled to write in order
to clear up some of the miscon-
ceptions expressed in the
article.

 First of all, in linguistics, we
no longer refer to peoples being
“wrong” merely when they
have pronunciations or gram-
matical patterns which differ
from the “norm.” The contast
of standard vs. non- (as opposed
to the older sub-) standard was
established in order to express
this difference. The article men-
tions a couple of times how
“Pittsburghers have trouble
with” certain sounds .- (long
vowels, etc.). This is not true. It
is not that Pittsburghers can't
pronounce these sounds; it is
merely the case that they don't

pronounce them. These sounds
just don't happen to occur in
the Pittsburgh dialect (inci-
dently, the term “idiolect" ref-
ers to that particular form of
speech used by an individual,
whereas “dialect" refers to the
type of speech in general use in
a community). A

Again, the same type of error
was made in reference to the so-
called grammatical errors made
by Pittsburghers. It may
happen that certain sentence
constructions (for example,
“the car needs washed.”) are
permitted in Pittsburgh Eng-
lish which would be viewed as
ungrammatical in other parts
of the country. This, however,
doesn't make them wrong, any-
more than speakers of Received
British English are wrong
because they would say “The
rugby team are winning,” or
“The company are located in

is Not Unique To Pittsburgh 0

London,” and we wouldn’t. As
long as the speech community
agrees on what is to be “right"
within that community, that
makes it right.

Regarding “slurvian" lan-

Dear Editor:

As a Moslem student, I would
like to bring to the American peo-
ple’s attention the events happen-
ing in Iraq and what happened
here on the campus last Saturday,
Nov. 20. The incident occurred at
about 4 p.rn. outside the Forbes
Quadrangle, where the Islamic

 Union of Iraqi Students (IUIS) was

about to hold a meeting to con-
demn the atrocities and crimes
against Moslems by the fascist
regime of the Iraqi president Sad-
dam Hussein. .

At 4 p.m., the IUIS wan-ted to
prepare the auditorium for the 5
p.m. meeting when they were con-
fronted by the Baathists (Iraqi
government agents), who, as usual,
were carrying sticks and clubs.

In 1968, the Baathists came to
power by a bloody coup and put
Ahmad Hassan Al Baker in power
as president. He massacred Iraqi
people who asked for justice. Al
Baker jailed, tortured and executed

dissidents, including many

intellectual groups as well as
workers and small businessmen.
His corrupt regime did not last
more than a few years. The Islamic
revolution soon started through-
out the region and forced him to

give up his rule to Saddam, a man
who could murder and execute
thousands of people by a single
order.

He ordered the massacre of Aya-
tollah Mohammed Baqer Sadr,
leader of the Islamic movement in
Iraq, and had his followers mas-
sacred and thousands of people
inhurnanely tortured.

The IUIS has been struggling
underground since 1968. It only
came to the surface about three
years ago. The IUIS wants to
expose the fascist regime of Sad-

dam to the worlds.

Last Saturday’s incident was,a
typical Baathists regime operation
against Iraqi dissidents abroad.
The IUIS wanted to hold a meeting
to expose the crimes committed by
Saddam and his regime inside and
outside Iraq. Once again, the Baa-
thists proved that they are crimi-
nals and are afraid of their crimes’

being revealed.
A Baathist was interviewed one
day on “Action News" at 6 p.rn. on

Channel 4. He claimed that he and
his friends wanted to negotiate ‘

with the Iraqi students and check
their passports. Why did they want
to do this?

This only proves that they are, in
fact, agents of the Saddam Hussein
regime,

The IUIS wants to hold another
meeting in the near future to pre-
sent to the public the truth about
what is happening inside Iraq. We
are asking those who are defenders
of human rights to help expose the
criminal regime and not to support
it.

Of Falsehoods

Dear Editor:

The article published in The Pitt
News entitled “Pitt Incident Mir-
rors Iraq Situation” is full of false-
hoods from its title to its ending.

The article started, “This week-
end’s clash between two different
factions of Iraqi students on cam-
pus." This contention is a com-
plete falsehood. I' challenge any
one of you to prove that any one of

- the pro-Khomeini people have an
Iraqi citizenship. My supposition
is that all of those people are Iran-
ians, though a few may carry pass-
ports of one of the Arabian Gulf
States, suchas Kuwait. But, they
are not Iraqis for sure.

I do not agree with “Mid East
expert” Richard Cottam that Al-
dowah exists in Iraq anymore.
There are people living in America
with pro-Khomeini beliefs. How-
ever, people with these beliefs and
Iraqi passports simply do not exist.
Thus, they can not be present at

3 this university.

The University of Pittsburgh
was deceived when it allowed what
it called “Islamic Union of Iraqi
Students” to reserve a meeting
room, as no such organization
exists at the University of
Pittsburgh.

We told the Students Activities
Office at Pitt about the reservation

three days before the event and they
told us that the reservation was
made by the Muslim Student
Organization. It is clear that it is
illegal to reserve a room to be used

‘None of us had any
weapons, in fact the
two men who were
injured are pro-
Hussein Iraqi stu-
dents....’

by another group from out of the
university. The University of Pitts-
burgh and the Muslim Student
Organization are fully responsible
for what happened, and we have
our rights to charge these two
organizations (Pitt 8c MAO).

The most insulting falsehood in
the article was the assertion that
what you called the pro-Hussein
group was armed with knives and
clubs. None of us had any wea-
pons, in fact, the two men who
were injured are pro-Hussein Iraqi
students, each of whom has been
studying a the University of Pitts-
burgh for more than a year. Uni-
versity records can prove this if
there any questions.

Hushan Husainy, who you
called a representative of “the
Islamic union,” has a suspiciously

Iranian-sounding name. Any Arab
would be able to comfirm this.
The assertion that the pro-
Hussein faction is not from Pitts-
burgh or are not students at the
University of Pittsburgh is rather
wince when 25 percent, if not all, of
Khomeini’s agents were from
Toledo and Cleveland.
I hope The Pitt News is fair
enough to print this letter.

Also, anyone who has read Cha-

Also, the “peculiar Pitts-

If anyone was taken aback by

Spain for proof of that ), and it
should never be handled with
anything but a great care for
and sensitivity to the people
involved.

So you have herpes?

  

It’s not as bad as you thinlk.

 
 

Herpes: The

Dreaded Disease

Although it’s called “the incurable dis-
ease,” getting herpes isn’t catastrophic.
It can’t be acquired as easily as most
people believe, and outbreaks of the dis-
ease can be treated so that pain is
relieved. For more information about
what herpes is, how it affects the body,
how common it is, and other aspects of

  The Inside Story:

Understanding Herpes Can
Impact

Lessen Its Emotional

Genital herpes is, perhaps,
one of the most well-publicized
diseases. Because of the nature
of the disease, it is the brunt of
many jokes as well as ‘the cause
of a social stigma attached to
those who have it.

Despite its extensive popular-
ity and the wide variety of people
who obtain it, herpes is probably
one of the least understood
diseases.

Dr. George Pazin, an infec-
tious disease specialist at Pitt,
says that through his research in
the treatment of herpes he sees
herpes patients of all ages and all
walks of life.

t>>DDDDD>>D>§D>DDD

y>>>>>>>>>>>>

“Clearly it’s widespread,” he
said, “but we don’t know for
sure how extensive herpes is in
Pittsburgh or even throughout
the country.”

Pazin attributes this lack of
data to the fact that doctors are
not required to report herpes.
Normally they must report infec-
tious diseases in order to aid in

 

 

    

Oops! Didn’t mean to get that.

 

their. prevention, but because
there is no way yet to prevent
the spreading of herpes, such
data would be of no use.

Although, according to Pazin,
“we really don’t know” how
many people have herpes, he
says “guesstimates” indicate
that 5 to 20 million people in the
United States may have it, with
100,000 to 500,000 new cases
each year.

Understanding Herpes

There are five aspects of geni-
tal herpes, according to Pazin,
and understanding these allows
us to understand the disease
better: -

>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>§

at Physical: The disease
involves excruciatingly pamful
fluid-filled sores that form on or
around the genitals.

ﬁr Medical: Herpes can be
spread to newborns, sometimes
causing serious disease and it is
associated with an increased
risk of cervical cancer.

* Social: The only way that

herpes can be transmitted is
through sexual relations and this
fact is the source of a stigma
attached to those who have the
disease.

* Psychological: Herpes is the

‘only sexually transmitted dis-

ease that can be treated and
remain incurable. It can reoccur
at inopportune times, causing a
great deal of anxiety, depression
and irritation in patients.

* Ethical: The person who
finds that he or she has herpes is

‘People don’t realize
that if they have a cold
sore and have oral-
V genital sex, it can end up
with the other person

“whether to tell” anyone about it
or not. ‘
Reports On the Rise

Three factors contribute to
the increased reports of genital
herpes, according to Pazin.

* Sexual behavior is a contri-
buting factor in that, Pazin sus-
pects, more people are using
intrauterine devices and “the
pill” as contraceptives, which lib-
erate one sexually butloffer no
protection against herpes, as
condoms do.

Also, an increase in oral-
genital relations is a factor in the
increase of the disease.

“People don’t realize that if
they have a cold sore and have
oral-genital sex, it can end up
with the other person getting
genital herpes,” Pazin said.

Another factor is that doctors
are better able to diagnose

‘Clearly it’s widespread.’

herpes cases now, partly due to
more hospitals installing virol-

ogy laboratories, which are
necessary to diagnose the
disease.

There is— also more publicity
about the disease than ever
before, bringing it out from
under the covers and exposing it
before the public.

How It Works
When one actually examines

the herpes disease, it will be
obvious that it is not as perplex-

ing or as scary as one might‘

think.

“The herpes virus is like a
package of chemicals,” Pazin
said, “and inside of this there is
genetic material. The virus also
has a lot of protein and a lot of
lipid around it.”

Outside of the cell, the herpes
virus does nothing, but if it gets
into the cell, the genetic material
redirects the cell’s synthetic
machinery so that the cell makes
the virus, rather than the other

products it would, ‘ordinarily

.......-¢...i|.. .;J:......  -. . 4

Houston photo

Once the virus is released, the
cell dies. The genetic material
inside of the herpes sometimes
gets into the nerves and
becomes dormant in the nerve
cell bodies near the base of the
spine. .

These dormant viruses can
reactivate from time to time and
move through the nerves to the

skin where they produce sores,

or tiny blisters, or to the_ lining

cells in the sex organs where
they may be released without
causing apparent sores.

Type 1 herpes, which usually
causes cold sores or fever blis-
ters, can be spread to the genital
area through oral-genital
relations.

“it’s important for people to
realize that this type of the virus
can cause genital herpes,” Pazin
said.

Type 2__ herpes, simple virus, is
more restricted to the genital
area and is transmitted by
genital-genital relations.

The herpes disease can best

be understood by looking at the

‘three stages of the natural
- disease.

In the first stage, called acqui-
sition, someone is exposed to
either Type 1 or Type 2 herpes
by some type of sexual activity.
Sex serves the function of rub-
bing the virus into the skin or
innoculating internally.

In the development stage, it
normally takes two to six days
for the disease to develop, but it
can take up to 20 days for the

,,.. disease to emerge.

When the initial disease
breaks out, there are two grades
of severity, either mild-moderate
or severe.

When someone has had cold
sores or fever blisters in the oral
area they tend to get the milder
form of the disease. This

When the virus is dormant, a
person is not contagious.

When sores are present or the
virus is present on the lining cells
of the genitalia, however, it can
be transmitted.

Recurrent herpes is usually

much less severe than the initial
herpes. The pain is milder in this
case, and the sores may be pres-
ent for only seven to 10 days.

Herpes can be spread
between two people even if they
have a closed sexual
relationship.

This occurs in one of two
ways: One partner may have
acquired herpes previously and
have it reactivate and spread or
either partner may have had oral
herpes which can spread by
oral-genital sex.

cially frightening to women

amounts to a few sores with
moderate discomfort in the gem-
tal area.

When those who have not
previously had genital herpes
acquire it, it tends to affect them
more severly. They will have
many sores accompanied by
fever or feelings of sickness,

. muscle aches, vaginal discharge
and lumps in the groin area.

This form of the disease lasts
longer, with pain continuing for a
week to 10 days, and the virus
will be present for 10 to 14 days.

People can get reinfected
from their partners or superin-
fected by another partner.

because of increased risks of
transmittimg the disease to new-
born babies and the increased
risk of ‘obtaining cancer of the
cervix.

“Women with genital herpes
are particularly frightened with
the idea of transmission to new-
borns,” Pazin said. “This is an
important potential problem.

“However, it should be
emphasized that if the genital
herpes is not active near the
time of childbirth, the woman
will not transmit it to the baby.”

If herpes sores are present at
the time of delivery, a Caesarian
section delivery can prevent

0

transmission of the disease to
the baby.

The risk of cervical cancer is
increased four to eight times in
women with herpes, but it can
be minimized greatly by regular
check-ups and pap smears.
Herpes Can Have Psycholog-

ical Effects

The physical repercussions,
however, are not the only effects
of genital herpes.

“Due to the fact that it is sexu-
ally, transmitted,” Pazin said,
“and due to the fact that it is

recurrent, it causes a great deal

of emotional upset. .

“It’s very important for peopl
with genital‘ herpes to have
someone from whom they can
get accurate information and
education as well asmedicine,”
he said.

One of the main reasons that
herpes is so emotionally upset-
ting to patients is the adverse
publicity given to it by books,
magazine and television,
according to Pazin.

“People who have herpes are
not amused by the jokes about it
and are not able to discuss it
with people because of this poor
understanding,” he said.

“For example, the newspaper
and magazine references to the
persistence of the herpes virus
on toilet seats and towels are

herpes are not amused
by the jokes about itand
are not able tadiscuss it

this poor understand-
ing.’

very misleading,’ Pazin said.
“We never see people who have
acquired herpes from toilet
seats. It’s always from having
sex with someone who is
infected.”
Treating the Symptoms

“Until recently, there was no
treatment for genital herpes.
Presently treatment is mainly a
symptomatic ointment which is
applied to the sores.

Acyclovir is the medication
which decreases pain and the
duration of shedding of the virus
during the initial disease, but
does not prevent recurrences.

“It really doesn’t get at the fun-
damental problem of the virus

getting into the nerves,” Pazin
said. “It ignores the inside aspect
of the infection.” .
Research is continuing to try
to find improved methods for
treatment of herpes. One that is
currently being studied in Pitts-
burgh is Human Leukocyte Inte-
feron, a natural protein made by

our body cells, which makes 1

other cells resistant to viruses.

“The main objective of this
form of therapy is to decrease
the severity of the initial disease
and decrease recurrences,”
according to Pazin.

A study has been underway
by Pazin and a team of five other
doctors for a little over two years
and it is expected to continue for
another year and a half.

There are currently 36
patients enrolled in the study,
which initially, was confined to
women only. In January Pazin
and his associates expect to
expand their study to men and
women and to include people
with recurrent herpes.

Having his best buddy
breathing down his neck does
not concern Sweeney as much
as one other thing-winning.
This year the Panthers have an
advantage according to Swee-
ney. “This year we played a lot
of tough teams,” he said. “We
know what it’s like to be in a
tough game like North Carol-
ina and WVU.”

Last year’s schedule was
indeed a factor in the Panther
loss. However, another contri-
buting factor was the change in
strategy, as Sweeney explained:
“We changed our game plan.
Instead of being ahead, we had

' to play catch-up ball.”

The Panthers’ were humil-
iated in last year's game, losing
48-14. For players, such as
Sweeney, who witnessed the
Nittany Lions topple their No.

1 ranking, a taste for revenge is
still lingering.

“There will be a bit of a
revenge factor, but it won’t be
the main reason we'll be out
there—-we’re going out to win,”
Sweeney stated.

Sweeney said that his job is
twice as easy thanks to the line-
men who surround him. “You
can’t play between anybody bet-
ter than (Rob) Fada, (Paul)
Dunn, (jimbo) Covert and
(Bill) Fralic. They’ll make my
job a lot easier,” he said.

Sweeney attended Seton-
LaSalle High School. There he
was a prolific player both as
center and as defensive end.
However, Sweeney always had
his heart set on playing at the
position of center. “I’ve been
playing center since I was nine
years old,” he said.

Although Sweeney stands 6-

Sweeney Centers Panther Line

4, he said he was not big enough
last year.

“I had trouble putting on
weight because of my high
metabolism. A daily regimen of
of pumping iron and consum-
ing a caloric intake comparable
to that of an elephant beefed
him up to a massive 235.

Sweeney is a valuable asset to
the offensive line. He is a fine
center and can also manage the
other line assignments _just as
well. For example, against
Rutgers, Sweeney played the
entire game at tackle, replacing
Bill Fralic, and received the
offensive player of the week
award for his performance.

This Friday will once again
be the day of “The Game.”
With Jim Sweeney’s presence
on the line, it might also be the
day of “The Win."

By DALE MOORE

While most of us will watch the
Pitt-Penn State game from the edge
of our seats, some people will be
watching with special interest.
These people have almost as much
at stake as do the Panthers and Nit-
tany Lions.

The members of the Sugar and
Cotton Bowl committees are the
worried parties. These bowls have
wagered respect, prestige and, most
important of all, money on Fri-
day's clash between Pennsylvania
powerhouses.

The Sugar Bowl committee
members knows what it is like to
gamble they do it every year. They
also know what it is like to lose———as
they did last year——also at the Pitt-
Penn State rivalry. But why do
these bowls have to gamble?
Because the NCAA says that they
must.

.According to NCAA rules, invi-
tations to the bowls can not be
released before 6 p.m. in each
respective time zone on the date set
by the NCAA. In recent years, the
date set has been the Saturday
before Thanksgiving. Some of the
bowl invitations—such as to both
teams in the Rose and one each in
the Cotton, Sugar and Orange—
are promised to conference cham-
pions, regardless of record or
national ranking. It is the three
open positions in the Cotton,
Sugar and Orange Bowls that cause
major headaches. These open posi-
tions usually are offered to teams
who are nationally ranked and are
not bound by conference
obligations. ‘

Using this procedure, each of the
bowls try to get a match—up that
will determine the national cham-
pionship. Unfortunately for the
bowls, the regular college season
isn’t over when they make their
choices. This is where the gam-
bling starts.

For example, last year’s Sugar
Bowl was the meeting place for
Southeast Conference ehampiéii
Georgia—at the time ranked No. 3
in the nation—against top-ranked
Pittsburgh. The Sugar Bowl, it
seemed, had the game for the
national title and, therefore, would
be watched by more people than

proceeded to lose to Penn State and
take a nose dive in the polls.
Although the Sugar Bowl turned
out to be the most exciting-
Panthers won the game in the last
minute of play——it was the least
watched of the five bowl games
played that day. Because of this
lack of interest, the Sugar Bowl lost
television revenue. The city of New
Orleans also lost revenue because
some Pitt fans opted to stay home
after thrashing by Penn State.

Although they were burned last
year, the Sugar Bowl returned to
the fire this year, asking Penn State
to face Georgia on New Year’s Day.
Also gambling on the outcome of
Friday's game is the Cotton Bowl,
which invited the Panthers. It
doesn’t take a genius to figure out
that one of these bowls is going to
get the shaft again this year.

This fact is very much on the
minds of the bowl committees. In
almost the same breath he used to
invite the Panthers to Texas, Cot-
ton Bowl committee chairman J.

-L. Hoffines, ]r., reminded the‘

Panthers that they had to win
again on Friday.

The fact that the bowl bids come
out before the final game between

Pitt and Penn State has hurt the -

teams in the past. In 1980, the’;
Panthers, ranked No. 1 for most of
the season, were only offered a trip
to the Gator Bowl because they had
a tough Penn State team remaining
on their schedule. This fact may
well have cost the Panthers not
only a major bowl bid, but also a
chance at the national champion-
ship. Instead of possibly facing No.
1 ranked Georgia, Pitt faced a
South Carolina team that was
barely ranked in the Top 20.

If the present system hurts both
schools and the bowls at times‘, why
isn’t the system changed? Would it
make a major difference if the bowl
bids were held until after the sea-
son? If this were done, the fan
would get to see more competitive
football and it should be easier to
pick a bona fide national cham-
pion. These season-ending rivalry
games may force the NCAA in this
direction. But until the NCAA gets
the inspiration to move, the bowl
committees will have to sweat out
the Pitt-Penn State game with the
rest of us.

’Lady Panthers Win Opener

  

By scon DELLETT

After suffering a disappointing
14-14 season last year, the Pitt Lady
Panther basketball team is back on
the right track for the 1982-83 cam-
paign. They easily handled Fair-
mont State on Saturday 79-59 and
Ohio University on Monday 98-78.

Sophomore forward Jennifer
Bruce led the Lady Panther scoring
attack in both games, scoring 24
points Saturday and 29 Monday.
Senior forwards Lynn Love and
Pam Miklasevich pitched in 17 and
16 points respectively Saturday
while freshman Kim Gannis scored

14 points Monday and Kim Tirik,
also a freshman, contributed eight
points and eight assists.

Coach Judy Saurer was pleased
with the performance of the fresh-
men and sophomores, but she

admits there are some things that
the Lady Panthers need to improve
on.

“The freshmen and most of the
sophomores, except Jennifer
Bruce, have not seen a lot of play-
ing time,” Saurer said. “I was
pleased with their performance,
though some did well Saturday and
others played well Monday.”

“None of the young players have
reached their potential yet. We
need to establish some consisten-

According to Saurer, National
College should provide a test for
the Lady Panthers.

“They have a good transition
game,” she said. “And they have a

real quick, aggressive team.” ..
In order to neutralize this transi-
tion game, the Lady Panthers have
to play better defense. _ _
“In order to stop their transition
game, we have to get back on
defense,” Saurer said. “We have to
get our transition game set. Scor-
ing 98 points is great, but we have
to concern ourselves with defense.”
Top players for the Westminster
Lakers are senior forward Brenda
Lee and ‘ sophomore Nancy
Anthony. Lee had an 11.4 point
average and 8.4 rebounds per game
while Anthony scored 9.5 points
per game while grabbing over
eight boards.

‘Wary’ Panthers
Open Against
Westminster

By SCOTT DELLETT

A superior team must be wary of
overconfidence when facing an
inferior Opponent. This will prob-
ably be the only problem for the
Pitt Panther basketball team as
they face Westminster College in
the 1982-83 season opener at the
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday.

“Sure, the players are aware that
Westminster will be up for the
game,” head coach.Roy Chipman
said. “They (Westminster) have
nothing to lose and everything to
gain in this game. We have to be up
for the game.” .

One problem Chipman will
have to deal with is the Titans’
backcourt, particularly Craig Ran-

-dall, Westminster_’s leading scorer

last season with a 15.2 points per
game average. .

“The strength of the team is in
the backcourt,” Chipman said.
“We have to be concerned about
them.

“We have to be concerned about
Randall.‘ He's their best offensive
player, and he shoots the ball
well.”

Another player Chipman is wary

of is forward Ron Lloyd, the

second leading rebounder on the
Titans’ 21-7 team last year.

He’s a big player,” Chipman

said. “Our big guys have to be-

aware of him.”
Chipman believes the Panthers

will be game-ready by Saturday
night.

“There are certain things you
have to do, but we’ll be as ready as

we are ever going to be by Satur-

day,” Chipman said.

“We need to put in special in-
bound plays and work on the press,
something Cibona wasn't going to
do.”

Another aspect the Panthers
have been working on is
conditioning.

“We won't be in the best of

shape, so in the last three days of,

practice, we have been working to
improve in this area,” Chipman
said. .
As long as the Panthers don’t
overlook Westminster, the start of

the 1982-83, season-—perhaps the,

most awaited season for awhile in
Pitt basketball-—shou'ld~ be
pleasant. ,

PITT NOTES: The Titans don’t I

have anyone taller than 6-6....The
starting lineup remains the same as
in the Cibona game; Clyde
Vaughan and Trent Johnson at
forwards, Billy Culbertson and
Charles Thompson at the guard
spots and Andre Williams at cen-
ter....George Allen, Chip Watkins
and Keith Armstrong will be the
first players off the bench....Pitt
leads the series 44-33....In the last
meeting, the Panthers easily
defeated the Titans, 75-44....The
last Westminster win against Pitt
came during the 1969 season.

He was to the ring sport at the
school what Jock Sutherland was
to football, Doc Carlson to basket-
ball, Carl Olson to track 8: field,
Rex Peery to wrestling, Leo Bemis
to soccer and Bobby Lewis to
baseball.

He was the outstanding compet-
itor on the freshman team when
boxing was added to the athletic
program at Pitt in 1930, and he was
the head coach of the boxing team
when the sport was dropped in
1939.

Pitt competed in boxing on a
varsity level for one decade-
during the so-called “Golden Era
of Sports,” _ when Pitt was a
national power in several sports-
and Schricker still has the letter
from athletic director Jimmy
Hagan advising him that Pitt was
abandoning both boxing and wres-
tling as intercollegiate sports “due
to lack of interest."

Schricker still takes exception to
that. “I never did agree that lack of

interest was the reason for drop-
ping boxing," says Schricker.
“Rather, there yvas a feeling in
society that too many injuries were
attributable to amateur, profes-
sional and college boxing.

“The depression of the l930s

‘caused many unemployed youths

to turn to amateur and professional
boxing in order to make a few dol-
lars. Many of these new boxers were
poorly coached and not too pre-
pared physically, and out of shape
for boxing. The result: many injur-
ies and bad publicity."

It was a period, indeed, when
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsyl-
vania, in particular, spawned some
of the greatest boxers in the sport’s
history. Pittsburgh was “The City
of Champions” back then, too.

Between July 13, 1939 and Nov.
18, 1941, Billy Conn, Sammy
Angott, Fritzie Zivic, Billy Soose—
he had boxed for Penn State——and
Jackie Wilson all won world box-
ing titles.

Schricker won his share of box-
ing titles, too. He captained the
varsity team for three years, and
was the I55-pound Eastern Confer-
ence champion as a sophomore
and junior, and a finalist as a
senior. _

In his fourth and final year as
coach, his team won its first East-
ern Conference team title at Mor-
gantown, W.Va. “Things were real
bright for future Pitt boxing
teams,” he recalls. “We had four
freshman boxers who were better in
their weight class than the varsity
regulars.” ,

Pitt entered a team in the nation-
als for the first time that year when
they were conducted at Charlottes-
ville, Va.

They were represented by Ralph
Dorand, a I15-pound Eastern
champion; Johnny Wargo (125),
captain Ralph Caruso (I35), Jed
Curzi (I45), Ralph Bornbe (153)
and Paul Ashman (165).

After Schricker, Pitt's best boxer
was Jimmy Giannati, a l35—pound
champion from Uniontown wh;
captained one of Schricker’s
squads.

The Pitt boxing team trained
first at Trees Gym, then they
worked out in a room just inside

Panthers
Matchup
Against
Lions

Both teams use their backs and
tight ends with regularity. Give a
slight edge to Pitt because of Daw-
kins and Collins.

Offensive Line: No match here.
Even though Penn State’s line is
good, you just can’t match two
tackles like Jimbo Covert and Bill
Fralic. An edge to Pitt.

Defensive Line: Greg Gattuso
has size, strength and quickness,
but Penn State's defense is not
geared to the line.

Bill Maas, J.C. Pelusi and I)ave
Puzzouli have provided solid play
throughout this season—edge to
Pitt.

Linebackers: Penn State is
referred as Linebacker University,
and junior Scott Radecic is a prime
example. Radecic leads the team in
tackles with 64 and is tied for inter-
ceptions with four, two of which
have been returned for touch-
downs.

Walker Lee Ashley is compared
favorably by Fazio to Hugh Green.

Ashley leads the Nittany Lions."-

with five sacks in nine games and
generally creates havoc to the
opposing offense.

Even though Panthers Al Weng-
likowski, Rick Kraynak and Yogi
Jones are good players, the edge
goes to Penn State.

Secondary: This area would be
fairly even, but injuries to corner-
back Tim Lewis and safety Tom
Flynn have shifted the balance.
Mark Robinson, Harry Hamilton
and cornerback Roger Jackson
were perhaps one of the main rea-
sons for last year's win because of
their intimidation tactics.

Edge to Penn State due to Pitt’s
injuries.

Kicking game: Penn State’s
Ralph Giacomarro has shown
more consistency than Pitt’s Greg
Ganzer and Tony Recchia. Eric
Schubert has been inconsistent
until recently, but so have Penn
State's kickers. Give an edge to
Penn State, due to its strong
tradition. ,

Add it up, and Penn State should
win. Like last year, however, a
position by position comparison
won't determine the results of this
gatne.

Pitt 21, Penn State 17.

Schricker Travels Through Pitt Boxing Program

continued from page fourteen
Gate 3 at Pitt Stadium, and boxed
at the Pavilion, a gym located
under the stadium seats where the

basketball team also played in
those days.
College boxing icompetition

consisted of three scheduled two-
minute rounds.

The boxing team usually per-
formed before or after the basket-
ball team played at the Pavilion.

Francis “(Iowboy" Siegel, a
guard on the football team, cap-

gtined the boxing team in 1933.

Several other fine football play-
ers boxed as well, including
Warren Heller, l7:')—pound class,
and heavyweights Arnold Greene
and Ted Schmidt.

Scliricker had never boxed before
he entered Pitt, but he became a
student of the sport. “I read every-
thing on boxing I can find," he
out e lioastetl

Boxing teams represented Pitt.
(iarnegie Tech, Duquesne,
\\'.tsl1ington  ‘l(‘ff(’l5()Il, West \'ir—
ginia, Bucknell. Penn State and
ilit‘lIl[)lt‘ then. Tech hosted the first

liastern (lonference champion-
bips. Pitt also competed against
schools as Syracuse. .-\rmy and

.\..v, regularly.

Schricker came out of (Iarrick
High School where he starred in
four sports. lIe played on the base-
ball team at (Iarrick forsix seasons,
and the hghlight of that long stay
was pitching a no—hitter against
Allegheny High. During the
summers of his days at Pitt, he used
to catch for the Pirates when Pie
Traynor‘s teams played some
minor leagueexhibitions. He even
hit a home run over the wall in one
such game. He was also a reserve
running back on the Pitt football
team.

But he never boxed until he came
to Pitt. It was introducetl as 21 var-
sity sport by Don Harrison, the
athletic director at the outset of the
’30s, and coached by joe Orsini.

The first time Pitt ever competed
against Duquesne in athletics, for
instance. it was in boxing in 1930.
Some say they have been at it ever
since.

Schricker had a long stay at Pitt.
He also helped coach the football
teain——as an aide to freshman
coach Mike Milligan during
Sutherland's reign~—and he earned
a bachelor’s, a master’s and a docto-
rate degree in education at Pitt. He
was a principal for a long period in
:i e Baldwin—Whitehall and Butler
school districts.

The boxing sport produced
another classroom success story as
well. That was “Wee Willie”
Davies, who was often referred to as
“the uncrowned bantamweight

champion of the world.” Davies V

held the North American title for
a while, and was thought to be bet-
ter than the reigning world cham-
pions, but couldn’t get any title
fights.

At age 28, Davies came up to Pitt
Stadium one day in the summer of
1934, shortly after Schricker had
been appointed boxing coach, and
introduced himself. He said he had
spoken earlier to Orsini about
helping him to, coach the team in
exchange for an education.

“I knew nothing about the

offer,” says Schricker,“‘but I said I

I’ would check with Don Harrison,

our athleticdirector, to see if he had
any knowledge about having Wil-
lie assist with the boxing
program.”

During a subsequent conversa-
tion, Schricker and Harrison disco-
vered that Davies had not
graduated from high school.
Undaunted, Davies went back to
high school. He had dropped out
in the middle of his junior year.

He went back to the same school
district where his son was an ele-

/mentary student. ‘What determina-

tion!" says Schricker. “In one year
he was back ‘to Pitt with his high
school diploma, and we enrolled
him as a full—time student. He
became the assistant boxing coach
in 1935.

“At the end of his freslnnan year,
Mr. Davies applied for admittance
to the physical education
nrotrra m . "

While being interviewed by Carl
Olson. the track 8: field coach.
Davies was told by Olson, “You're
too small to handle high school
classes; they will run all over you?"

Davies responded: “No they
won't. What does size have to do
with respect and discipline? Napo-
leon wasn't much bigger than me
and be conquered the world!"

Enough said. Willie Davies was
admitted to the physical education
program. He later obtained a mas-
ter’s degree in education at Pitt.

A good deal of reminiscing was
devoted to Davies when three
former Pitt boxers got together for
a round table discussion on the
sport in the winter of '82 at “Frog-
 the Downtown restaurant-
saloon where the sports photos and
memorabilia covering the walls
sparks such talk.

Dick Conti. a retired engineer
and \'ars1ty Letterman of Distinc-
tion, was there along with Dr.
George Dines, a general surgeon,
and Russ Vogel, former director of
the Pittsburgh Parks 8: Recreation
Department.

“Because Pitt was so good in
football, and fairly good in basket-
ball, we boxed and wrestled at the
same level," said Dr. Dines. “We
went up against the best teams.“

This prompted a story by Vogel,
a vociferous little fellow who still
looks fighting trim. “We went out
to Wisconsin when they were the
national champions," he said
“That was the coldest winter ever
up until this one, and we went out
there by train. Boxing was big time
there, and they had about 113,000
fans in the stands."

(Ionti entered the conversation:

  

W4/u in t

“The men in the first few rows
wore tuxedos, and the women wore
evening gowns. I never saw so
many people in my life!”

Vogelcontinued his tale:

“Plattsburgh State boxed Wis-
consin’s ‘B’ team in the prelimi-
nary of a doubleheader program,
and Wisconsin’s fighters were
knocking them out, one after
another. And they kept carrying
the Plattsburgh fighters on
stretchcrs through our dressing
room.

“The ring was red with blood,
with a white patch here and there. I
looked in the bucket, and it was red
with blood. Bud Moore, our
trainer, tells me, ‘Don't worry
about anythng.’

“I was going up against the first
lefty fighter I ever fought, and he
was a Golden Glove champion out

of Chicago. The crowd was yelling,
‘Bring on Pittsburgh!’ There was
this one little boy at ringside I’d
met outside the building, and I'd
let him carry my bag in. He was
hollering, ‘C’mon, Pittsburgh.’ He
was our only fan.

“This guy was good, but I stayed
in there for three rounds, and lost
by decision.”

(Jonti came back, “I remember
Schricker saying, ‘We wan; to
make a good showing against the
national champs.’ Well, we didn’t
disgrace ourselves."

Dr. Dines summed up his expe-
rience as a Pitt boxer, and the
benefits from that experience in
this manner:

“You were out there by yourself,
and you had the possibility of get-
ting hurt. It did something to you.
It made you self-reliant. Afterward,
there was such a feeling of relief.
