Beating victim recovering

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

David Orsborn does not
remember being beaten up on
the steps of the Towers two
weeks ago. .

He does not remember being
kicked in the face, knocked

unconscious and falling down ‘

the concrete steps, his head
banging on each one.

On Tuesday, David was
released from Presbyterian
University Hospital, but his
recovery is just beginning. He is
now in the Bryn Mawr
Rehabilitation Center outside of
his hometown of Downingtown,
Pa.

“He is starting to talk, but he
does not recall what happened,”
said Orsborn’s mother Heidi.

Helping a cause...

“We had to tell him.

“The doctors have to evaluate
him over the weekend,” said
Mrs. Orsborn. “He’s making
progress, but it is a day-by-day
thing.” ‘

An oﬁicial at Bryn Mawr said
the center could not comment
on any of its patients.

p. According to the Department
of Public Safety, the four juve-

-niles who were arrested in the

beating are currently in the
Schuman Juvenile Center. They
are scheduled for a hearing
today. .

The Allegheny County
District Attomey’s office said
they could not comment on the
case because the defendants are
juveniles.

The only adult arrested in the
beating, Toby Ekunfeo, 18, of

Homewood, had a hearing
scheduled yesterday, but it was
postponed. Ken Service, Pitt’s
director of communications,
said a date for the next hearing
has not been set yet.

Orsbom, 20, was beaten up on
Jan. 13, around 11 p.m. on the
steps of the Towers. He was
knocked unconscious as stu-
dents walked up and down the
steps, walking around the attack,
accordingto Public Safety.

On Jan. 20, Public Safety off1- .

cers arrested two suspects in the
attack, after a week-long investi-
gation that included the FBI and
the Justice Department.

After those initial arrests and
the continuing investigation,
Public Safety officers arrested
three more suspects in the next
two days.

forest
appeal

Members of Pitt’s
Student Environmental
Action Coalition are cel-
ebrating a legal victory
which may help save
forests and wildlife.

SEAC members work-
ing in conjunction with
the Allegheny Defense
Project have won an
appeal which will pre-
vent ll2 acres of forest
from being cut down and
sold.

SEAC member Matt
Peters drafted the appeal
which questioned” the
validity of the White Cat
Salvage Project, a plan to A
cut down dead sugar
maple trees in the
Allegheny National
Forest. The White Cat
Salvage appeal is only
the fifth. appeal that has
been won out of about
1,000 appeals filed in the
United States since 1993.

“Certainly it is a huge
morale boost for forest
activists nationwide,”
Peters said. “But true vic-
tory will come when our
public forests are no
longer threatened with
destruction from extrac-
tive industries.”

ROTC
dispels  
image

By David Palmer
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s ROTC cadets
have fallen victim to
stereotypes common to
the military.

Two of the most
common stereotypes
are that all the men
want to portray the role
of Rambo and that
women are less than
feminine.

But after a closer
look, Pitt cadets are no
different from anyone
else.

ho, stereotypical
Rambo types. We are
just normal college stu-
dents who are going
into the army,” said
ROTC member Annie
Carroll.

ROTC cadets are a
very close-knit group
held together by
uncommon bonds. The
cadets differ in every-
thing from taste in
music to their favorite
television shows.

“We are all very
close because we’ve
seen each other rise
and fall and at our best
and worse,” Carroll
said.

Developing leader-
ship skills is the most
important aspect cadets
are taught in ROTC.
They are taught 16 dif-
ferent leadership
dimensions ranging
from sensitivity to
judgement. ’

“ROTC is all about
leadership; it builds
confidence,” Carroll
said.

Cadets have physical
training every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday
from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m.
This training involves
push-ups, sit-ups and
running with an occa-
sional variation in the
routine.

Carroll said, “It’s not
the army in the sense
that they make us drop
if our shoelaces are
untied, but it’s very

professional. __

Poliiiceil interest low among

By Ed Abolins
Staff Writer

Just as the federal govern-
ment is experiencing its
biggest transformation in 40
years, political interest
amongst college freshmen
nationwide is at a 29-year
"low.

According to a study pub-
lished in the Jan. 13 issue of
The Chronicle of Higher
Education, only 31.9 percent

of college freshmen said—

keeping abreast of political
affairs was of-major impor-
tance to them, and only 16
percent said they discussed
politics frequently.

The survey, conducted by
the Higher Education
Research Institute at UCLA,
polled 237,777 freshmen
from 461 institutions across
the coun-try.

Statistics revealed that
high stress levels and heavy
workloads were the main

factors diverting students
away from politics.

Jarrod Caruso, vice-presi-
dent of Pitt’s College
Republicans, said he wasn’t
surprised by the study’s find-
ings.

“I first noticed a general
apathy towards politics when
I was in high school,” he
said. '

Caruso said he feels
most freshmen in college
are not interested in politics
because, in most cases,
their voting eligibility is
newly attained, and “they
think nobody listens to
them.”

The president _of‘Pitt_’s
University Democrats,
Hayes Davis, said he feels
part of the problem is that
students don’t always see the
relevance of daily political
affairs, especially issues that
don’t receive excessive
media coverage.

issues just"‘aren’t glamorous
and don’t receive much

press.” But, “seeing politics‘

in action is a good way to
get involved.”

While general political
interest has declined in
recent years amongst college
freshmen, some specific
-issues in the survey (which
have been heavily publicized
in the past) grabbed a great
deal of their attention, with
environmental issues topping
the list.

Eighty-four percent of
freshmen said they feel the
federal government is not
doing enough to control pol-
lution, and 71.9 percent
think the government should
do more to curb energy con-
sumption.

Also included in the study,
73 percent of freshmen said
they feel there is too much

concern in the justice system V

for the rights of criminals
and only 20.1 percent feel

abolished.

Almost 80 percent of first-

handgun control, 59.7 per-
cent believe abortion should
be legal and 70.5 percent
think a national health care
plan is needed in the United
States.

The statistics of the 1994
UCLA
nationwide voting statistics
from the most recent elec-
tions, in which the average
voter turnout was 39 percent.
The average turnout for vot-
ers ages 18-24 was under 16
percent.

According to past surveys
conducted by the Higher
Education Research Institute
at UCLA, interest in politics
amongst college freshmen
has declined by 10.5 percent
from 1990, and has dropped
by 25.9 percent since 1966,
the first year that the study
was conducted.

the organization.

All members at the meet-
ing agreed with the pro-
posed steering committee
plan.

Details, such as how long
a member can hold an
office, still need to be deter-
mined. The group agreed to
tentatively schedule office
elections for the last week
of March.

Until then, BiGALA
will continue to have meet-
ings and socials, but no
interim officials will be
named.

The members also unani-
mously approved a new
mission statement. The new
statement is a condensed
version of the previous one.

It reads in part, “As a stu-
dent organization, we will
work towards creating
awareness of social, politi-
cal and heath issues facing
sexual minorities...”.

15 chapters throughout the
country.

Delta Lambda Phi will be
open to all college—age peo-
ple from the Greater

"Pittsburgh area.

“As a student organization, we will work

towards creating awareness of social,
political and health issues facing sexual

minorities ...”

— BiGALA’s new mission statement

Bill Gray, a BiGALA
member, announced a new
gay fraternity that will form
next year. The fraternity,
Delta Lambda Phi, is a
national organization with

“The main purpose is to
create a Greek experience
for gay men who have prob-
lems going through the fra-
ternity system,” said Gray.

Gray said he wants to

bring Delta Lambda Phi to
this area because of his own
experiences as a Phi Kappa
Theta member. He claims he
got along well with ‘his fra-
ternity brothers until he
wrote an article for the The
Pitt News about being gay
in a mostly straight fraterni-
ty. After the article
appeared, he says his broth-
ers made him feel unwel-
come.

“They can’t legally tell
me I can’t be a part of the
fraternity,” said Gray, “but
they can make me feel I am
not a part of them by throw-
ing me the cold shoulder.”

Gray hopes to have more
information regarding Delta
Lambda Phi as the semester
progresses.

“The instructors challenge
you but also support you
along the way.”‘

The ROTC program stress-
es studies to all the cadets,
Carroll said. They are con-
stantly reminded why they
are at school.

Pitt ROTC cadets have
won several awards showing
their commitment to excel-
lence. They won the
Pennsylvania Ranger
Challenge, Pennsylvania
Governor’s Trophy and were
recognized as the top ROTC
battalion on the east coast.

In addition to their normal
schedules, 10 to 15 cadets
worked as volunteers at the
Jubilee Kitchen on Saturday,
Jan. 28. The cadets will
serve food to the less fortu-
nate people in the area.

The ROTC program is not
all work, however. The
cadets have several social
functions such as December
Dining In and the Military
Ball.

“These events give us the
chance to socialize in a dif-
ferent context than just
ROTC,” Carroll said.

°From page I
Act requires, Peters said.

“Our position is that this was
a ﬂagrant violation of federal
law which casts a shadow on
the integrity of the Forest
Service,” Peters said. “This is
one more example on a growing
list — that the main reason the
Forest Service exists is to cut
down trees for the benefit of
industry.”

The ADP expressed concern
that the Forest Service is harm-
ing rather than helping the for-
est with projects such as the
White Cat Salvage.

“Salvage deals with a group

of trees that is dead or dying,
and to save the trees, they cut
them down,” said SEAC mem-
ber Susan Curry. “You are not
really saving the trees, you’re
saving the economic value they
represent.”

SEAC and the ADP hold that
the death and decay of trees is a
natural and necessary part of the
forest growth process. Dead
trees provide nutrients for the
soil and a habitat for wildlife,
Curry said.

“Had scoping been done,
these issues would have been
raised,” Peters said.

“The Forest Service goes to

dead trees really fast,” Curry
said. “They run in and take it to
make profit.”

According to Peters, the

Acting District Ranger of the

Bradford Ranger District in the

Allegheny National Forest.
“The salvage program is not

senior citizen outreaches and
student nature walks to support
residents’ logging communities,
Curry said. ’

Forest Service makes billions of to make a product of everything SEAC is also in the process of
dollars in below cost timber that dies,” Apgar said. “Our organizing a national SEAC
sales each year, and in effect goal is to create a mosaic across gathering to be held in

provides a subsidy for huge tim-
ber corporations. ,

The Forest Service claims that
at any one time, they operate on
less than one .third of areas
affected by events that cause
trees to die, such as insects, tor-
nados and wind storms-

“We understand the value to
having dead and down trees in
the forest,” said Jim Apgar,

the landscape of different
desired conditions.”

In some cases, the best thing
to do is harvest trees that die
before their product value is
lost, Apgar added.

About 12 of Pitt’s 30 SEAC
members are also active mem-
bers of the ADP. SEAC plans to
remain active with the ADP in
the future, and is planning to do

Allegheny National Forest this
June 13-20. Pitt’s SEAC chap-
ter will host approximately

1,000 students from across the ’

country. Peters said the gather-
ing will include workshops,
lplayshops, community service
and education.
“It will have a significant
effect on the work we do in
Allegheny Forest,” he said.

Back to the   moon!

History is about to made by the U.S. space program once
again. According to The New York Times, the pilot of the
next Space Shuttle Discovery mission will be a woman. This
will make her the first woman to ever pilot a NASA space-
craft. Her ﬂight will also be the country’s first to the Russian
space station.

While NASA’s views on gender equality are laudable, they
do little toward truly advancing the United States’ presence
in the high frontier. .

‘With the slash—and—burn policies that are sure to come
under the current regime and a lack of appreciation for sci-
ence in general and the benefits of space exploration in par-
ticular, NASA will have to justify its program. Increasingly,
thinking about the future concerns cyberspace and
other Earth-bound realms. Little thought is given to the
numerous spin—offs which made much of this technology
possible. In addition, the satellites which much of this tech-
nology is dependent upon are a direct benefit of the space
program.

Large stores of untapped resources are also available out-
side of the Earth’s atmosphere. The possibility of colonies on
the moon and other planets are often relegated to the realm
of science fiction. The real reasons they do not exist are a
lack of vision and funding.

Mankind is far behind where it should be in the exploration
and understanding of this universe. Now, NASA’s ability to
advanced this is crippled. The way forthem to recover isto
set out a bold agenda for the next 10 years, much like
President Kennedy did in the early 1960s. All of these opera-
tions in low Earth-orbit, many of which benefit the garrison
mentality of this country by installing defense satellites, are
self-defeating because they are not producing visible
progress. The proposed space station has run so over-budget
that there has been talk of buying the Russian space station
outright. '

Plans must be established for returning to the moon. A per-
manent manned station there within two decades is not a

' technical impossibility. A recent editorial in The New York

Times suggested that deuterium, a form of hydrogen used in
fusion, is abundant on the moon’s surface. The column also
told of other nations’ plans to get to these resources.

Objections to the space program are usually raised in the
form of: “We have enough problems here on Earth.” This
reﬂects the lack of awareness of all of the spin off benefits
derived from manned space flight. While the technical bene-
fits are of value, there are less tangible benefits which will
nevertheless be of increasing value in the next century.
"Increased economic opportunities will come with a larger
space program. In addition, the increased demand for scien-
tists and engineers will encourage more people to enter these
fields, increasing this nation’s brain trust.

U. of Beanville

It seems ironic that the
drink of choice for genera-
tion Xer’s is coffee. For a
generation that is constantly
hassled for its laid—back atti-
tudes and seemingly unmoti-
vated lifestyles, coffee has
emerged as a wonder drink
that makes us feel super—ro-
ductive.

With coffee we can get to
class, get homework done,
clean the apartment, go out
until 2 a.m. and still ‘have
energy to deal with our
roommates problems. But
don’t be fooled, all is not
well in Beanville.

Anyone who drinks coffee
regularly can remember the
time they had one drink too
many. The _ throbbing
headache, the cold sweats,
shaky hands, nausea, insom-
nia  ‘

Coffee house advocates
feel a sense of accomplish-
ment when they see people
turning to the local coffee
shop instead of the local bar.

Are people addicted to cof-
fee somehow better than
those who throw back a few
Iron Citys? Who would you
rather be driving behind: the
weaving, slow-moving
drunk, or the jumpy guy with
the Bruegger’s mug squeezed
between his thighs because
he needs both shaky hands to_
steer?

Cancer patients who smoke
too much and cirrhosis
patients who drink too much
are a constant reminder of
the evils that plague two of
college campuses’ favorite
pastimes. What will the
poster kid for caffeine look
like? Probably a shot of him
laying in bed with an IV liq-
uid lunch, since his rotted
stomach no longer digests
solids.

Oh well, it’s really all just
big business I guess.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Colombians need to make
their money, the coffee house
owners need their share and
Starzl will surely get his
share when he starts doing
stomach transplants. Happy

sipping!

Racism not dead

I remember going to the
multicultural diversity semi-
nar during my freshman
advising session. The actual
presentation didn’t make
much of an impression on
me, but the discussion group
afterwards did. The group I
had been shuffled into con-
sisted of all white people,
including myself and the
mentor leading it. During our
discussion such comments
as, “All black people can do
is play basketball,” and “The
Japanese should go back to
their own country,” were
made. '

I was shocked and angered-

to the point that my knuckles
were turning white. One guy
actually said, “This is our
country, what do they think
they’re doing?” “Our” in ref-
erence to Europeans. I quick-
ly brought up the fact that we
tore this land out of the
hands of the Native
Americans, and by no means
was this our country.
Basically, my point is
this: if such blatant racism
and cultural egocentricism
is going on here, especially
among incoming fresh-
men, then where is the
harm in trying to get them to
drop these backward views?

.I am not promoting sepa-

ratism. I am not necessarily
promoting stressing diversity
to the point of exclusion.
I am simply promoting
the need for destroying igno-
rance. I definitely believe
there is a need for cult-

ural, racial, sexual and reli-
gious tolerance on this cam-
pus. ‘

Nora Galler

Promote tolerance

This letter is in response to
Erika Kendra’s “so—called”
editorial that appeared in The
Pitt News on Jan. 30. Ms.
Kendra objects to diversity,
claiming that it is “a direct
contradiction to the idea of
equality.” ‘

Strange, but I thought that
tolerance of diversity
was fairly consistent with
ideas of freedom and equali-
ty.
She also claims that the
Africana Studies Department
is “aimed solely at promot-
ing racial hatred” and that
courses offered by the
department should not dwell
on white oppression of
blacks. She ignores the fact
that race relations define the
history of African
Americans. You cannot
examine African-American
culture without acknowledg-
ing that slavery, segregation
and discrimination are a part
of that culture.

It may not be pleasant for
some people, but denying the
rights of anyone to champion
pride in their culture is no
better than the actions of fas-
cist dictators who cru-sh
opposing views.

Ms.
reminded me of something a

guy I went to high school.
4 with said during a discussion

on Martin Luther King Jr.:
“I’m not racist, Ijust don’t

like black people.” Racism is _

not dead. Ignoring it does
not promote equality, it
implies approval. I do not
approve.

When was the first time you real-
ized the next time would be the last
time? You remind yourself that you're
the underdog, that inequality exists,
that your hands should be in the cook-
ie jar. Boy, tomorrow, yeah, tomorrow
sparks will fly and heads will roll.
Procrastinate no longer, for legendary

social watchdogs Lydia Lunch and ‘

Exene Cervenka will speakto you,‘ at
you and for you on Feb. 7 at a pro-
choice benefit sponsored by Pitt’s
Campus Woman's Organization.

‘‘I tell the truth as I see it, in an
aggressive and female fashion,” said
Lunch.

Don't expect a Camille Paglia-type
gestapo of university-speak. Cervenka
and (especially) Lunch present high
velocity rants without subscribing to
political or career agendas. Armed with
sarcasm, fervor and a battery of
social/political/emotional commentary,
Lunch dissects the human experience,
targeting boys’ club power structure
and dogma. Her tenacity and sauci-
ness garner comparisons to fellow
wordsmiths Bruce, Rollins and Biafra,

yet she delivers narratives as a silver- ~

tongued civilian.

‘‘I never claimed to have any
answers or solutions to the world situa-
tion: I merely report on it as I see it,”
said Lunch in RE/»Search’s Angry
Women.

Lunch’s diatribes have appeared as
spoken-word performances,
written prose, startlingly candid
videos with director Richard
Kern and collaborative efforts
with The Birthday Party’s
Rowland 8. Howard and Sonic
Youth’s Kim Gordon. Her legacy
as discontent and assaultive
has tagged her a “confrontation-
alist:” confronting the “basic root
of anger, of fear, of emotional
dystopia, of dysfunctionalism,
and of social inequality.” ,

' Expect to hear dissertations
from a dubious citizen: prison
population, censorship, welfare,
O.J. and, appropriately, abor-
tion.

“Any control a woman might
have over herself, the govern-
ment and the right wing espe-
cially wants to try to abolish,”
she said. “They [the govern-
ment] want to raise and breed
more capitalist consumers so
that they can continue in their
corrupt ways.”

Co-survivor and co~poet'for
the 1982 Grove Press release
Adulterers Anonymous, Exene
Cervenka may herself have
inspired a slew of disaffected
youth. Her career in LA’s X with
husband and writer John Doe,
her published poetry and her
social critiques have carved a
place for her as a feminine icon.

‘‘I reflect on the response, the
defense, the opposing view,”
said Cervenka.

While some have gone as far
as to say that she’s “cooler than
Rollins,” his label, 2.13.61., is
the press for two Cervenka pub-

lications: Virtual Unreality (1993) and

recorded material to be released on
2.13.61. will‘ be Cervenka’s Surface-
To-Air-Serpent, a 44-minute spoken
word LP due out in April.

Appearing on the Rock For Choice
collaboration, she’s no stranger to the
pro-choice effort. However, a double

cause appears somewhat ironic com-
ing hot off the heels of the big pro-life

Sixteen Stone
Bush

"Trauma Records/Atlantic

This review comes with a
prelude, a warning of sorts.
First, there is no chance of me
ever being called indie-boy by
anyone in the Vox section.
Secondly, I like Pearl Jam (a
coming out of sorts). I own the
first album as well as the sec-
ond (and I know l’m not the
only one, because I couldn't
afford to buy the million-plus
records that have been sold).

That out of the way, maybe
you’ll understand the bucket of
praise I will now throw at this
band.

The first release by the
London-based Bush is both
dark and up-beat at the same
time (Gee, kind of like Vedder
and company). The lyrics
dwelling on the more somber
aspects of life — death, cults
and the ego, among other
things — are often disguised
by the catchy ring of power
chords and sticks-through-the-
skins rhythms.

Bush was formed two years
ago by four painters who fund-
ed the band by diluting the
paint they were given money
to buy, then using half the
paint cash to pay for rehearsal
time. The album was, for the
most part, recorded live in a
London studio with producers
Clive Langer and Alan
Winstanley (both responsible
for discs by David Byrne and
Elvis Costello).

Sixteen Stone kicks off with
the band’s first video/single
release, “Everything Zen.” In a
sarcastic vein, guitarist/vocal-_
ist Gavin Fiossdale pretty
much declares a cynic’s dis-
enchantment to the world:
“Raindogs howl for the centu-
ry/A million dollars a steak/As
you search for your demi-
god/And fake with a
saint/There’s no sex in your
violence.” And that's just the
first song.

On what is probably the
most powerful track on the
disc, “Bomb” is told from the
perspective of a man killed in
a bomb blast, hence the title.
The song is based on the
actual bombing of a London
pub. The narrator speaks of
the family he will never see
again and the power of the
person(s) responsible for the
attack: “Jekyll in you/Brings
out the wired in me/I have no
defense/l’m all that you
see/The night is a bomb
blast/T he night is on fire/Sing
with me in the gasoline choir.”

Now for the‘ drawbacks. The
unlisted track “Alien,” comes
in at six minutes long. The key
word here is long, as in about
five minutes too long. Unlike
anjg of the other songs, the

vocals are indistinguishable,
blending in with the repetitive

drone of guitar, bass, drum, -

guitar, bass, drum  followed
up by the 43-second “X—
Girlfriend,” which consists of
the final cord from “Alien”
being held for, well, 43 sec-

onds.
l’m pretty sure Bush will get
a lot of exposure. “Everything
Zen” is already selling well as
a single, and it’s only a matter
of time before MTV picks up
the video and sets it into con-
stant rotation. (And six months
later, when we're all sick _as
hell of this band, I will deny
writing this review.) Until then,

enjoy!

Complete Services
lgnmon
dischord records

In the early ‘80s, a new atti-
tude toward punk rock was
engineered by some intelligent
worki-ng-class kids in
Washington, D.C. Sick of the
drug-induced message spread
by bands like the Sex Pistols
and the Go-Go’s, they found a
cause of their own and a
medium through which to
preach it. Injecting their
straight-edge politics and
Puritan blue-collar values into
high-energy hardcore, bands
like Minor Threat and
Government Issue gained a
religious following. Suddenly,
D.C. became a breeding
ground for these grassroots
bands. More than a decade
later, Ignition is one product of
that once-innovative time. ’

With a blast of bar-chord
noise and Alec Mackaye’s
angry voice, Ignition follows
the path of its peers. The
lyrics do not falter from this

. earlier time either. Lecturing

on anti-capitalism and non-
personal excess, Ignition tries
to teach a lesson that has
already been taught before. In
“Buy And Sell,” Mackaye
anguishes over friends
becoming fashion plates: “Buy
your way into this/Buy your

/ V

way out of that/Sell yourself to
him/Or to the latest style.”
Didn’t Social Distortion writea
song similar to this years ago?
After a while it becomes a bur-
den to listen to.

This should all come as no
surprise. After all, Ian
Mackaye is Alec Mackaye’s
brother. Sounding as if
Complete ' Services was

recorded on a four-track rather ‘

than in a recording studio, it
becomes clear that Ignition
has taken more than at few

pointers from Ian Mack'aye,.

who also produced the record.

Granted, Complete Services
is a compilation of their earlier
albums recorded in the late
‘80s. This, however, is no
excuse for re-releasing songs
that you probably already own
or have thrown out long ago.
The strong hardcore anthems
work to an extent but the lyrics
tell it all: “Just another sinking
feeling/Slowly sinking in.” -
Ignition “Sinker”

Broken Circle/Spiral Hill
Lee Ranaldo .
Starlight Furniture Company

As haunting as electricity
itself, this new five—track EP by
Sonic Youth guitarist Lee
Ranaldo is a welcome clue as
to what he’s been up to lately.
Less chaotic than his earlier
release on SST, this new
record seems almost medita-
tive and is reminiscent of
some of the material on the
Sonic Death cassette, and the
glory days of Bad Moon
Rising.

Fianaldo is supposed to
have published a book titled
Near Here this year, but so

far I have had no luck in locat-

ing the book's publisher.
There is a spoken word piece
on this album, called
“Bloomington, Indiana,” and I
took this piece as an indication
of the direction his literary

efforts have taken. The final

track is a “cover” of “Brand
New Love” by Sebadoh, but
it’s really just a tape recording

' // / , «
 /Z;

/

of Ranaldo teaching part of
the tune to someone in a hotel
room. My only regret is the
fact that this record is so short
(17 minutes). I hope there is

‘more Ranaldo material forth-

coming.
There is no denying the

importance of a band like

Sonic Youth in rock and roll
music today (as l’m sure even
the most fashionable wom’en’s
magazines have repeatedly
informed you), but one does

get the feeling that as-each‘

year passes, the individual
band members keep the
whole mechanism going as a
way to ‘keep the money rolling,
and that their true creative
interests are probably» in their
respective “side projects.” I
certainly don’t think there’s
anything wrong with that. In
my opinion, Sonic Youth has
never put out a bad album, or
anything that smelled too
much like an artistic compro-
mise. Steve Shelley has said
that Geffen ran their 1990
major label debut Goo
through a “de-noiser,” but I
would challenge anyone to
find a better corporate rock
album put out that year.

Anyway, the point is that if
these folks can make a living
doing the rock star-arena-
FlEM-tour thing by day (and I
thank the One True Lord that
that will not be the case in
Pittsburgh, at least), and then
produce more “honest” (which
Fianaldo certainly is), obscure
recordings by night, then they
should, as long as they can
stomach it. This band has
done a lot of good in the
world, and they deserve what
they get.

Incidentally, the accompany-
ing artwork, also evocative of
electrical circuits and a dark
and silent sort of power, is as
beautiful as the recording is.
The members of Sonic Youth
also have a respectable histo-
ry of gaining exposure for their
favorite visual artists, and a lot
of people love them for it.

Clear Creek Road
The Nixon Clocks
Blue Ducks ll

Believe it or not, a progres
sive band for the ‘90s has
been found, and they don’t
own a distortion pedal. The
Nixon C_|ocks, a local band
that made news by beating out
Pittsburgh's favorite sons and
daughters Rusted Root inthe
Pittsburgh City Paper's best
band to dance to category,

havebeen staking claim to-the -

‘Burgh bar scene for close to
five years now.
Recent reviews of the

‘Clocks’ new disc have been a
"favorable for the most part, but

concentrate on the ‘80s synth
sound the band emits.
Drawing comparisons with
one—hit wonders Talk Talk and
Tears For Fears, these com-
parisons may be accurate, but
is that really so bad? Try get-
ting into the Luna on a
Thursday night (‘80s night). If
you ask me, they should milk
this ‘80s sound for all it’s
worth. _

Prior to actually listening to
the disc, I had heard a lot of
positive things about this
band. They pack Nick's Fat
City every Thursday, so they
must be doing something
right. But, with exception of
the first track (“Miss
Courageous”), they don’t
seem to be doing it right in the
studio. They sound tight and
melodic, but extremely pol-
ished and lack volumes in
originality. The lyrics waver
from the predictable folksy,
tales of the trials and tribula-
tions of John Q. Public, (the
life of a coal miner on “We
Dig,” and remembering some-
thing that should stay forgot-
ten on “Clear Creek Road”) to
the undistinguishable “Crimes
of Fashion” (‘‘I hear you knock-
ing but can't come in/Crimes
of fashion and I think it’s a
sin/One more dollar on your
money tree/It's enough to terri-
fy me.” What??).

Are they
real? Where do they get them?
Unsane’s album covers always gener-

-ate more controversy than any of

Jane’s Addiction ever did. The Sub Pop
single they put out in ‘91 is truly a great
record, but the front cover art will be
remembered more than “Vandal-X” will.

..' .
u

  .l   ......:m. ..  
I guess it is hard to ignore a body, pre-
sumedly naked, covered in blood in a
fetal position in the corner of a room
splattered in ..‘ blood. Total
Destruction, their last album, has a
cover equally drenched in the red stuff
— this time a messy automobile

surely repulsive, one is

drawn to the cover with an

unparalleled curiosity. What
could a band sound like that
puts out albums that looked

' like that?? Perhaps the cold

New York reality gives the

band a sarcastic, nasty atti-

tude. Whatever the inspira-
tion, Unsane’s music is gut-
wrenching and then some.

In 1991 Matador
Records signed the band in a
massive hype storm. This
was a band that helped make
‘ Matador a major force in the
indie world. From previous
work on the TreeHouse and
G|itterHouse labels, Unsane
had proven to be a band that
was uncompromisingly
unique. ‘

. Their sound was (and
. basically is) ul-tra heavy.
Unlike the Melvins, who uti-
Iize sparse, dense chords
that plod over slow, power
drumming, Unsane is more
chaotic. They utilize a guitar
attack that would be more

. similar to NYC’s Lower East
Side art punkers than heavy
metal heroes of yesterday.
On the Matador release,

Unsane, songs like “Organ Donor” and
“Exterminator” proved to move beyond
basic, user friendly indie-punk conven-
tions; these songs were vile. The
drums, vocals and noise assault of the
guitars made for a sound that was grat-
ing, intense and HEAVY.

February 2 1995

Describing Unsane gets difficult; they
have to be heard to be appreciated.
How do you convey their definition of
“hard-core?” Slashing, searing guitar
jolts that leave you maimed and distu-
gred  bone shattering beats  a fry-
ing pan to the head bass clatter? They
sound like the album covers look.
Testoterone rages, unadulterated vio-
lence the bleak urban landscape all
color the expressive clamor. They
translate the banal to a punch in the
face guitar riff. The music conveys the
message — the lyrics could be nonex-
istent and the story still heard.

It almost came to a screeching halt
when the band's drummer overdosed
on heroin (|’ll assume). Rumors of a
breakup seemed viable, but the band
put outa singles compilation in 1992 in
memory of their former drummer, fol-
lowing that with another Matador
release of new material called Total
Destruction. The band only contained
one original member, but continued to
purvey the Unsane sound truly. The
album was met with mixed reviews, but
the consensus was that the group was
back and too good to die just yet. Plus,
they still put on a good live show.

The last time Unsane hit the ‘Burgh
they showed up at the Beehive around
1 a.m. and played for about a half an
hour. This time around, they’re sure to
start rocking on time with support by
locals Shale and Blunderbuss. It's
bound to be another exciting Luciano’s
show, so don’t miss _it on Feb. 6, 8 p.m.
All ages, so come all.

Saturday Night Live
Saturday, 11:30
NBC

I remember the first time I
saw Chris Farley on Saturday
Night Live. He was running all
over the screen, practically an
animal screaming, his spit fly-
ing on all the other actor's
faces, and it was funny. I
laughed, I think. The second
and third time I saw it I
laughed, too. That was about
fifty Farley screams and spits
ago. Now I turn the channel.

That about sums up my feel-
ing for Saturday Night Live, a
dying program that now seems

to rely more on getting people‘

to watch because of the musi-
cal guests than the sketches.
Viewers are hit with recurring
characters and situations that
at one point were amusing, but
quickly become routine and
boring. To make matters
worse, its most talented cast
member, Phil Hartman, has left
to pursue his “own sitcom
(because TV doesn’t have
enough)

Oh, how the mighty (or at
least marginally amusing) have
fallen. But what’s really wrong,
what's left to salvage, and can
this show be fixed?

One of the major problems
with SNL, as in most pro-
grams, is the writing. Sketches

are routinely one joke that, if

not working or presented well
enough, flounder for five min-
utes. For example, a Steve
Martin appearance earlier this
year had a fake infomercial in
which he was selling “penis
cream.” That's it. The whole

. idea. Five minutes of television

that focused its appeal onthe
word penis. If I remember cor-

rectly, a group of friends and I V

made up a similar product in
second grade. An idea like that
goes under the heading “that
could have been funny if they
did it right” —— a tag that could
be added to almost anything
on the show. Another example
came on this week’s show
when they‘ focused on commu-
nity programming and its non-
professionalism. Again, the
whole idea ended with the
premise. Funny, huh? Try it for
an hour and a half.

The problems don’t end with
just the writing either. The cast
seems more often than not to
be stumbling through their
lines and reading from cue
cards, and when problems
arise, as they do on live pro-
grams, they giggle it off, afraid
to improvise at all.

Really, the only thing that
keeps SNL on the air is its
name recognition (this is their
20th season) and the talents of
some of the cast members.
Mike Meyers is funny, Janine
Gurafalo is talented, although
slightly overused, and Norm
MacDonald,-the news guy, has
a dry yet solid, delivery. Adam
Sandler, if he is ever used in
situations other than a stupid
teen-ager or in rhyme, has
promise, and Chris Elliot can
play a goofy guy fine, but who
else is there? Chris Farley
(okay, Chris, are you going to
fall down this time or spit food
out of your mouth)? Kevin
Nealon (welcoming him back
for his fifteenth straight year)?
Michael McKean (one word-
Lenny)? The list after that is
even worse.

How can it change? A good
idea would be to look at some
other programs of the same
kind and see what they’re
doing right. Two shows, MTV’s
The State (yes, there is some-
thing good on that channel
other than Kennedy) and Kids
in the Hall are good examples
of sketch comedy that are reg-
ularly funny. What do they do
that SNL doesn’t? I think it
comes down to two things;
they use the absurd more often
and the men dress regularly in-
drag. .

AJPARTMENTS-AV’ IIABW
IN THE ()AKLAND AREA

SNL is usually topic-orient-
ed, satirizing the events of the
day, but they use the same
jokes and ideas that are in the
editorial cartoons everyday,
and when they do go beyond
the headlines, they seem afraid
to go too far. The reason they,
and for that matter most come-
dy shows like it, are on the air
is that they did go too far, they
got noticed and they made
people laugh. They seem
afraid to do something com-
pletely out of the ordinary,
something that just doesn’t
usually happen.

As for the drag issue...well, I
don’t know any real reason.
Honestly, it just makes for
funny scenes, allows the view-
er for one more thing to laugh
about. It can at least create
better situations than what they
have now. ‘

There are a lot of things
going wrong on the show, but
with the name recognition and
the ability to get popular musi-
cal guests, Saturday Night
Live should stay around for a
while. To do more than merely
survive, they just have to take
more chances, stop relying on
the same characters and situa-
tions, and, most importantly,
have the male cast members
put on dresses. ‘

“As the corporate ogre
expands its creeping influence
on the minds of industrialized

youth, it has infected the cre- _

ative community with its black
plague of indentured servi-
tude. We are the gravediggers
who have buried the spectre of
rock star myth.”

-International Pop
Underground Compilation, K
Records, 1992

“It's the music, stupid.”

-quote on a pamphlet avail-
able at the CMJ Music
Marathon, 1993

The quotes above present
two divergent, yet equally valid
perspectives on the state of
independent and major label

‘music. K Records is a small

label based in Olympia,
Wash., which has presented
indie music for a little more
than a decade. The folks at
the label, like many others
which have crept up since K's
inception, pride themselves on
the fact that they’ve main-
tained their grass roots level,
presenting original music on
their terms without compromis-
ing or doing anything in the
name of the almighty dollar.

You have to admire them for
that. They’ve stuck to their
guns and managed to thrive.

But on the other hand, indie
rock has given birth to an indie
elitism, which says that every-
thing associated with a major
label is bad, even if the band
we’re discussing started out
on a indie label. _

Now a lot of the music being
dished out "by the big labels —
hell, most of it — doesn’t come
within shouting distance of the
power of a lot of indie rock.
But that doesn’t mean that all
of it should be tossed out the
window on principle. Many
bands that sign to a major pay
the price by compromising
their sound, but not everyone.

Which brings me to the sec-
ond quote. You listen to a
record for music, not to devel-
op an agenda. And if you do,
grow up. High school is over.
Just because your favorite
band signed to DGC, don’t
give up on them. (Be skeptical,
maybe.) And besides, if I gave
you a blindfold test and made
you guess an indie from a
major, I have a feeling I could
stump you.

where recognition outweighs
the significance of profits,
which are scant anyway.

And if you think something is
missing in the music scene,
it’s easy to start your own do-
it-yourself. You can virtually
run a record label from your
bedroom if you want a try.

Ever since the birth of punk
rock in the late ‘70s, Pittsburgh
has seen a lot of significant
bands, radio stations, record
stores and self-made maga-
zines come and go. The fol-
lowing presents a current
guide of all of them. And
remember, if you aren't satis-
fied with what you see, make

The debate can go back and
forth. Independent labels by
and large feature some of the
most exciting and unique
music coming out today. But
the majors have some goodies
too, as evidenced by recent
releases by Gumball and Hole.
On the other hand, some
indies are responsible for -
some masturbatory releases
which exude the “it’s-good-
because-it-sounds-like-shit”
credo.

Yet in the final analysis,
what makes independent
labels more exciting and
meaningful is the fact that
they're fueled by basic inspira-

tion. And that comes from your own.

they don’t cover every song
with distortion, they rely too
much on the Howard Jones-
esque synthesizer to move the
music along (which does little
more than make the listener
reach for the fast forward but-
ton).

Enough of the stereotypical
rock cynic- (I mean critic-)
speak. The one major excep-
tion on Clear Creek Road is
the first song “Miss
Courageous.” By far, this is
one of the best songs |’ve
heard in a while, locally or oth-
erwise. The lyrics reminiscent
of early political U2 are intelli-
gent, while not being too top,
heavy for the music itself:
(“Don’t let the mood control
you/Don't let it reach your
heart/This game of cards is
fixed my dear/You’ve been cor-
nered from the start.”)

While lknow it’s not popular
to tear down a local band on
their first effort, neither would it
be right to say this is a great
album that you should run out
and spend your money on.
(And besides, I’m not from
around here.) All in all The
Clocks on disc leave a lotto be
desired. Maybe next time
around they'll be able to bottle
up the live sound their shows
are known for and bring it into
the studio. Until then, if your
taste for local music still needs
to be quenched, I suggest buy-
ing the Duck Tracks Returns

was to be Oropeza’s soap box
from which he would rant
ridiculously about the Steelers

capped the evening off with a
furious paradox, ‘‘I don’t

ture,” to which my friend
groaned, “Oh, yeah. Why are
you in a band, then?” if Rage

cy was hard to swallow with its

of pre-established poseurs will
seem especially empty.

As the CD fades out on
“Dying of Thirst,” we hear
Oropeza screaming, ‘‘I am

equation.7l am more than a
chemical combination. My exis-

Eide’s. A huge store that
stocks almost every kind of
independent music on vinyl
and CD. Lots of heavy metal
and comic books as well. 1111
Penn Avenue, Downtown.

Paul’s Compact Discs. Once
it was Jim's Records. Now, it’s
Paul’s CDs, and its owner car-
ries on the tradition of carrying
every new blues, jazz and folk
release along with good selec-
tion of indie releases. They
have a small but strong vinyl
selection too. 4526 Liberty
Avenue, Bloomfield. 621-3256.

Jerry’s Records. Like people
who start indie record labels,
Jerry Weber sells records
because he loves them. You
couldget lost among all the
wax in his store. Now diversi-
fied, his Squirrel Hill Wax Only
Store is just a skip up Forbes
from his Oakland CD
Superstore where he houses
two floors of compact discs.

Oakland. 687-1234. Ask them

second floor of 128 Oakland
Avenue and ask if it’s the
Hemp Hour. (It isn’t. it’s the
Greek Store; Hemp Hour is
upstairs.) Then walk upstairs
to Pop Bus and ask Manny if
he has any Smashing

Manny Theiner prides himself
on the fact that he exclusively
carries independent (and often
obscure) releases. While the
store focuses on vinyl, includ-
ing a good selection of 7” sin-
gles, some CDs are available
too. Oakland. No phone num-

Fanzines

In addition to the regular daily
and weekly papers, you can
also read about local artists
and musicians in the following
fanzines.

Discourse. Out of service for
nearly four years, this music
fanzine recently resurrected
itself. Articles on national and
regional bands as well as
record reviews. c/o lgor
Records, P.O. Box 81517,
Pittsburgh, PA, 15217.

Geek Girl. Photocopied (in
blue and white!) ‘zine that fea-
tures reviews of records and
other ‘zines. The collage-type
layout also includes ‘essays

 

 

and goofy letters. Simple, but"

fun to read. lt’s refreshing to
see young women putting out
‘zines. P.O. Box 1957,
Pittsburgh, PA, 15230.

Minus 7. Features articles on
local musicians and artists.
Unlike the other ‘zines men-
tioned here, which are photo-
copied, Minus 7 has a slick,
printed layout. 1723 Murray
Avenue #33, Pittsburgh, PA,
15217.

Pawholes. The women runnin’
this are so sharp that previous
issues of this post-punk femi-
nist publication are worth
searching out, and there
should be a back issue rush if
this town's kids ,weren’t so
square. But if you’re not into
their prickly past, why not
check local mag racks ‘cause
there’s a brand spankin’ new
(well, almost) one around. P.O.
Box 81202, Pittsburgh, PA,

Bands

And finally, this town is full of

‘ a lot of bands. More than we

ketball that
is launched with no one
guarding the shooter.

Sometimes, you are
allowed to take two, even
three of them in a row.
Other times, if you make the
first one you are awarded
another shot. -

It is the foul shot, a con-
cept that the Pitt Panther
basketball squad did not
grasp under the regime of
Paul Evans. It took a new
head coach, Ralph Willard,
to teach the Panthers the
concept of making foul
shots on a regular basis.

And it is not only foul
shots. Willard has brought
the art of fundamentals to
Pitt basketball. Just look at
the_stats. ’

Center Jamie Peterson '
shot 58 percent from the
charity stripe last yfea_r.,T-his
season he leads the team; '
hitting on over 80 percent.

“':-The improvements in foul

shooting are seen through-
out the the rest of the team
as well. Point guard Andre
Alridge is shooting over 75
percent, including his eight-
for eight-performance in the
final minute of last week’s
St. John’s game, sealing
Pitt’s only Big East win this
season.

Alridge’s backcourt mate,
Jason Maile, has also turned
it around, hitting just under
80 percent,‘ as compared to
last year’s 53 percent.

Overall, the Panthers are
making 73 percent of their
free throws this year. Last
year they made 64 percent.

Willard has done a lot
more than make the
Panthers better free-throw
shooters. He has the team
well-conditioned and
although their record does
not show it, he is getting a
lot more out of his team
then Evans, or any other Pitt
coach ever has.

Bob Knight, the Indiana
Hoosiers’ head coach, once
said you can’t make players
run faster but you could
make them run longer. That
is what Willard has done
with the Panthers.

Peterson and Alridge have
missed just nine minutes of
Big East play between the
two of them, and this isthe
first year they have been
starters.

Jaime '5 House

Peterson takes the Big

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

After weathering criticism
for more than a year about his
game, his build and his statis-
tics, Pitt center Jaime Peterson
finally had the perfect chance
to throw it back in the face of
his doubters last week.

The Big
Commissioner’s office
announced Peterson had
earned Player of the Week
honors.

But unless he’s on the bas-
ketball court, the Big East’s
second-leading shot blocker is
not the type of guy to throw
something back in anybody’s
face. " I

“I am where I am because
of hard work and practice,”
the 6-foot-9, 200-pound
Peterson said. “I practice hard
so I can play hard.”

Peterson’s game has risen

- above the solid fundamentals

which he worked on since last
year. Seemingly from
nowhere, Peterson developed
a finesse which has not only
kept Pitt in most of its games
this year, but has also estab-
lished him as one of the best
players in the Big East.

“There’s no question, he is
the mos.t improved player in
the Big East,” Pitt head coach
Ralph, Willard said. “In fact,
people talk about him being
so improved, but improve-
ment aside, I feel he has
established himself as one of
the 10 best players in league.”

The statistics prove
Wil1ard’s assertion. After 10
Big East games, Peterson
leads the conference in
rebounds, averaging 11 per
game. Not bad, considering
this is Peterson’s first year as
a starter in a conference which
traditionally boasts the best
big men in the country.

Jim Madl/Staff Photographer

Pitt center Jaime Peterson was named the Big East Player of the Week last week.

“I think he had 56 points all
last year [in the Big East], and
look at him now. He almost
gets that in a week,” Willard
said. “Its been a result of great
work ethic. We have individ-

ual workout sessions with our
players, and ‘he works
extremely hard every day.
Most importantly, he’s
improved in all phases of his
game, not just one area.”

Streaking ‘Cats visit the Field House Saturday

By Brad Isles
For The Pitt News

After another disappointing loss
on Tuesday, the Panthers return
home to the Field House Saturday

‘night to sink their teeth into‘§ome

Kittles and ‘Cats — the 19th-
ranked Villanova Wildcats and
their star junior Kerry Kittles.

The slumping Panthers are hit-
ting a streaking Wildcat squad, '
who have won their last five
games. This streak includes a win
against Pitt two weeks ago.
Villanova holds an overall record
of 13-5 and a league record of 6-
2.

The ‘Cats are led by Kittles, a
6-foot-5-inch shooting guard, who
is second in the league in scoring.
He is coming off a week where he
averaged 25 points and seven
rebounds, an effort that helped
him capturehis second Big East

Player of the Week award.
In his last meeting with the
Panthers, Kittles had 16 points

Miami. He averages 14.9 points
per game.

Also expected to make an

However, it may not be Kittles
who the Panthers are going to
look to contain. Forward Eric
Eberz scored a career-high 25
points in their previous meeting.
Eberz has also been on ﬁre from
behind the are, shooting 49 per-

cent on the season and draining

six of eight last week against

rebounder, with 6.4 per game,
sophomore center Jason Lawson.
He had a season-high 12 against
Pitt in January. Lawson is third on
the team in scoring, averaging 12
points. In his last game against

Providence, he grabbed lO_.=‘

rebounds and scored 17 points
while blocking six shots.

Another ‘Cat starter at forward
will be Chuck Komegay, a trams-
fer from North Carolina State,
who became eligible at the semes-
ter break and now averages 8.8

points and 4.5 rebounds for his

new team.

The fifth starter for Villanova
should be Jonathan Haynes.
Haynes, a point guard, came off a
preseason stress fracture in his
rightfoot and is now averaging
5.3 assists and 9.9 points per
game. '

Villanova will be without their
other co-captain, Ron Wilson,
who is nursing a stress fracture in
his foot. He had a screw surgically
implanted on Jan. 13 and is out

Ms. Martin criticizes David...

Mr. Saliba.

It's nice to know that there are so
many perfect people on this campus
especially on -The Pitt News staff.
Almost every day there is an article
written in The Pitt News bashing the
basketball team. In yesterday’s col-
umn, “Antigua: Stuck in a
Shakespeare tragedy,” not only did the
columnist ridicule the team’s play but
looked for someone to blame it on.
Once again the blame fell on Orlando
Antigua, The _Pitt News’ favorite
scapegoat.

Can we really blame all of the
team’s losses on one person? I would
hope not. Mental mistakes run ram-
pant at a Pitt game, all players con-
tributing to this total. This idea of
imperfection is probably inconceiv-
able to people as perfect and knowl-
edgeable as the Pitt sports writers who
insist on pointing the ﬁnger. Your vast
knowledge of the game of basketball
must not include the importance of a

where. That's hot!

today for a free brochure.

Take a Spring Break reality check. South Padre Island, Texas,
is the hottest Spring Break destination for many reasons.

The Island is a hot spot for student's offering exciting music,
a sea of watersports and legendary nightlife. It's even close
enough to give you a spicy taste of Mexico. But the lsland’s
location makes it even hotter; it's further south than any other
major Spring Break destination in the United States. That's right.

And that means tropical sunshine, white sand beaches, clear
blue water and more sun-drenched days than just about any-

Located on the tropical tip of Texas, South Padre Island is
convenient by car or by plane and only 25 miles from Mexico.

person like Orlando Antigua. An
emotional leader is just as important
as a scoring leader. The emotional
leader of a team is always there to
encourage, support and take control of
situations that are getting out of con-
trol.

Orlando Antigua is this person. He
is the person who can be seen patting
someone on the rear end after a good
play or the person who has there arm
around another player offering words
of encouragement. VV1thout a person
like Orlando on the team, who would
be there to congratulate them when
they played well or help keep them
going after a loss? Certainly not The
Pitt News or the fans.

If you are looking for someone to
blame for the losing record, blame
Paul Evans. Under Paul Evans we
saw some Pitt all-time lows, and
thanks to his late departure, no depth
on the bench this year. So next time

...Davidﬂres back.

Ms. Martin,’

I’m not sure which
paper you have been read-
ing as of late, but the fact
that writers of The Pitt
News are bashing the bas-
ketball team is an exag-
geration. '

On my own behalf,
your interpretation of my
column is a bit off. Taking
a different twist, I decided
to compare what was
written to a tragedy. Not
the type of tragedy that
you are speaking of, but
one that represents the
rise and fall of a situation
with comedian elements.

You easily jump at the
same opportunity that you
are accusing me of doing
in my column. I am not
blaming Antigua for Pitt’s
record. The fact that he

scored 23 points against
B.C. is a testament to
what he is capable of
doing. He has the poten-
tial to lead the team in
scoring, and that was
exactly my point.

Also you state, “This
idea of imperfection is
probably inconceivable to
people as perfect and
knowledgeable as the Pitt
sports writer who insists
on pointing the finger.”
And just what are you
doing by stating only a
few sentences later, “If
you are looking for some-
one to blame for the los-

ing record, blame Paul V

Evans.”

Well Ms. Martin if you
go back about three
weeks, you’ll find a col-
umn that I wrote praising
Ralph Willard and his
team while laying the
demise of this program on
the head of Paul Evans
(“Paul’s couldn’t hack-it,
Jan. 11 ed.). I made a
point of how Evans cor-
rupted this system, but yet
you wouldn’t count that
as a pro-Willard column
would you? You quickly
blame me for pointing the
finger, and in hypocritical
fashion you do the same
thing.

Agreeably leadership
does not have to come in
the form of points, and I
state that Antigua is an‘
emotional leader, a spark
plug. But the fact that he
can score 23 points is evi-
dence enough of his
potential. .

And finally, any intelli-
gent person would be able
to deduce the fact that this
column which you criti-
cize was written before
the B.C game.

Peterson  

°From page 9

cent from the field and 2.33
steals per game, are good
enough for third in the Big
East. His free—throw percent-
age, 83 percent, is up 38 per-
cent from last year and also
earns him third place among
league leaders.

“I’ve been putting in a lot of
extra time on my free throws,”
Peterson said. “Like when we
practice, I shoot free throws in
between segments when I’m
really tired. Iiknow how tired
I’ll be in the game, so I prac-
tice that way.” V

Considering he plays each

_ game with the knowledge that

he is needed for the entire 40
minutes, tired is probably an
understatement for his end—of-
game condition. Not to men-
tion the fact he must avoid
fouling out, since Pitt’s under-
manned squad has nobody
who can come close to filling
Peterson’s shoes at either end
of the court. _

“There is a lot of pressure
on him, because he knows he
has to play carefully,” Willard
said. “He understands the lim-
itations we have as a team and
plays exceptionally well with-
in those limitations.”

However, Peterson says
pressure to stay in the game
through foul trouble and keep
producing is not a problem.

“I go out there and have
fun,” Peterson said. “If you go
out there timid, then some-
thing bad is bound to happen.
I go with confidence, and
whatever happens, happens.’_’

Born and raised in Upper
Manhattan, Peterson said the
road to the Big East has been
long and hard, but his eye has
been on this goal all along.

“I grew up a Syracuse fan
and loved to watch guys like
Derrick Coleman,” Peterson
said. “I always liked the Big
East and knew that was where
I wanted to play basketball.”

However, he did not always
believe basketball was a real-
istic dream. While growing
up, Peterson says his main
game was baseball.

“Baseball is very big among
the Dominican people, and
that’s what I concentrated on,”
he said. “But then I started
growing and growing and
growing.”

By his sophomore year of
high school, Peterson had
grown enough to grab the
attention of Max Good, head
coach at Maine Central
Institute prep ‘school. After
lettering two years and earn-
ing the Most Improved Player
Award at Maine Central,
Peterson was poised to break
in as a force in the Big East.

“I was so happy when I
signed with Boston College, I
was realizing a dream I had,”

Peterson said of his signing of '

a BC Letter of Intent after his
senior year. “But it only led to
disappointment when I got my
scores.”

Peterson’s scores did not
qualify him for the scholar-
ship, leaving him to sit out a
year or go to junior college

Wand work his way back to

  LAUGHTEH

“I can’t really explain it, but
I think people from New York
have an attitude which helps
them get past a lot of obsta-
cles in life,” Peterson said.
“You go through the rest of
your life with a lot of confi-
dence.”

When asked why he chose
Pitt over the various other
teams that came‘ knocking,
Peterson said it all went back
to New York.

“I played on the same sum-
mer league team as [Pitt point
guard Jerry McCullough] in
high school and we got to be
good friends,” he said. “When
it came down to picking a col-
lege, I trusted Jerry.” '

Peterson, who came here
during the tenure of former .
head coach Paul Evans, said
he’s glad Pitt has changed to
Willard’s style of play.

“That’s my type of style, I
love running at that tempo,”
said‘Peterson, who ran the

Division 1.

He chose to play at little
known Champlain Junior
College in Vermont. With
Peterson at center, however,
the team recorded a 28-5
record during the 1993 season
and earned a berth in the
NJCAA championship tour-
nament. They finished eighth
in the tournament, and
Peterson had Division I
recruiters looking his way
again,

Peterson, who is of
Dominican descent, gives his
mother the credit for his drive
for success.

“She raised me and taught
me to always, always work
hard,” he said. “When you V
face problems while growing
up, you learn to find waysto
overcome obstacles.”

He said he sees that quality
in lot of people, but especially
those who grew up in the Big
Apple.

school and junior college.
“This year we’re doing things

“And he doesn’t just look at

Under Evans, Peterson the little things that can win

played behind Eric Mobley,
who was chosen as a first-
round pick in the NBA draft
this past June. According to
Peterson, Willard’s coaching
style is not the only contrast
with Evans.

“Evans was an all right
coach, he had his plays and
methods and that’s what we
followed,” Peterson said.
“But Coach Willard is the
type of person who cares
about you on and off the
court, he is interested in your
success as a person.”

Peterson said Willard teach-
es to give everything you
have to whatever you choose
to devote yourself, and, most

games.”

To prepare for this season,
Peterson went south during
the summer, playing two
months for the Dominican
National Team.

“That was a great learning
experience, because you get
-to play against guys with a lot
of ability,” Peterson said.

Even though he felt he had
the skills to play in the Big
East, Peterson said he knew
he could use some bulk.

“In the offseason I was lift-
ing every day, even while
playing with the Dominican
Republic,” he said.

off. His league-leading num-
bers have come at the expense
of some of the biggest players
in college basketball. Just this
past weekend, Peterson out-
muscled Georgetown’s front-
line of Don Reid, Othella
Harrington and Jerome
Williams for a game-high 16
rebounds.

“Right now I’m trying to
act with leadership on the
ﬂoor to help turn this season
around,” Peterson said.
“Coach Willard told us he had -
the same problem in his first
year as coach at Western
Kentucky — few scholarship

players and a losing record.
But they ended their season
with 10 wins in their last 12
games, and he emphasized
that point before the St.
John’s game [last week].”

Pitt ended up with a victory
in the St. John’s game, its
only Big East victory thus far
in a season in which fans have
watched them lose only one
conference game bydouble
figures. Peterson said it was
especially nice to win in New
York City, but he’s hungry for
more wins.

‘‘All my friends were there

and a lot of Dominicans,” he

said. “There were three

[Dominicans] playing:
myself, Orlando Antigua and
[St John’s] Felipe Lopez. It
was nice to go home to a
crowd like that and be able to
leave with a win.”

When asked if turning in a
Player of the Week perfor-
mance against St. John’s in
front of his friends at
Madison Square Garden was
the best game of his life,
Peterson quickly shook his
head.

“I know we have better
games ahead,” he said. “We
just have to keep working
hard and not ever get comfort-
able with where we are.”

The rest of the Panthers
are running twice as hard as
they did last year with half
the bench. That is notjust
because they want to get
some exercise.

Willard works them hard
in practice and it shows in
the games. The Panthers
might not have what it takes
to win close games, but the
endurance and the tenacity

I that Willard has preached

has put them in a position to
beat some ranked teams.
Even beyond bringing .
fundamentals back to Pitt
basketball, Willard has

taught the Panthers to stay
focused for 40 minutes, _
something that was rare last
year

Next time you are watch-
ing the Panthers, take a few
a minutes and watch Willard
yelling and screaming, scru-
tinizing every dribble and
shot. His enthusiasm has
definitely rubbed off on the
team.

So next time you criticize
the 1-9 in Big East Play
Panthers, don’t just say’
“We’ll be better next year.”
Be grateful we don’t
have Paul Evans calling

the
shots. I
