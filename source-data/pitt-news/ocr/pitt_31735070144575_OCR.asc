City to vote on charging students in dorms

by Lindsay Carroll
Se/zior Staﬁ’ Write/'

Pittsburgh City"Council again
delayed a vote at Wednesday’s
meeting that would count dor-
mitories as apartments in a new
registration process, which would
require tenants to pay an annual
fee.

Councilwoman Tonya Payne
proposed‘ an amendment to a
city ordinance that would exempt
dormitories from paying the $12-
per—tenant annual fee that land-
lords are expected to pay begin-
ning April 1. The fee is part of a
new system of tenant disclosure
requirements the city might im-

pose on the landlords.

Payne, who chairs the Public
Safety Services Committee, asked

the council to table the amend-
iment for the second week in a
row. She said that the idea trig-
gered other institutions, such as

nursing homes and halfway hous-
es, to ask for’ exemptions as well,
creating a more complicated legal

issue.

“We need to make sure this

is fair all across the board,” said
Payne.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said Pitt is opposed to classifying
dormitories in the same way as
apartments.

“There are substantial differ-

ences between dormitories and

private apartments, including
restrictions on visitors, living ar-
rangement restrictions and an
educational component in that
dormitories have residence as-
sistants,” said Fedele. “There are
programatic offerings through
residence life.”

Payne represents parts of
South Oakland, where many Pitt
students live off campus. She
said universities see themselves
as exempt from thelegislation
because they are not the same as

landlords, whom the legislation is ,

targeting.

“I think they’re dead on,” said
Payne.

Pitt currently requires students
to sign a housing and dining ser-

vices contract.

Students who sign the con-
tract agree to follow University
regulations, paying for any dam-
ages to the room and not hold-
ing the University liable for any
damages or injury to themselves
or their property.

The contract lists move-in and
holiday closing dates students
need to follow. 1

Bill 1073 is an ordinance that
amends the Residential ,Housing
Rental Permit Program section of

the Pittsburgh Code to “include
dormitory in the deﬁnition of a
rental unit, and in the exemption
clause.”

, The bill establishes that a rent-
al unit means “any dwelling unit
or residential structure containing
sleeping units, which is leased or
rented from the owner or other
person in control of such units,
to any tenant, whether by day,
week, month, year or any other
term,” according to the legisla-
tion posted on the council’s Web
site. “ ‘

The ordinance currently ex-
empts hotels, motels and bed-

’ and-breakfasts.

The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People was
founded 100 yearseago today, and its
century of contributions are visible
right here in Pittsburgh.

With its history rooted in the pro-
curement of equality and civil rights for
all people, the organization continues

’ its work with one of the strongest lega-

cies in black history

But the NAACP changed more
than just black history It helped to re-
structure the ftarne of American soci-

“People have viewed [the NAACP]
as an Aﬁican-American organization,

escalated intro violence, but that would have dis-
tracted from the purpose”

Glasco said that the peaceﬁil nature of the
NAACP activities in Pittsburgh can in part be at-
tributed to the sympathetic character of the city’s
white leadership, especially from Mayor David L
Lawrence, in whose memory Pitt’s David Law-
rence Hall is named.

The overall tone in Pittsburgh was not so
much about black vs white, with one winner and
one loser, but more of an understanding that the
goalwast3omaketheUnitedStatesbetter,said

Glasco.

In 1968, however, the city did erupt.  as-
sassination rocked the country, and Pittsburgh fell
to the trend of enraged rioting It left the cityin a
daze of uncertainty.

“1969was averydepressingtime,” said Glasco
“People saw that the rioting and the violence had
been ahuge mistake, thatall they didwas destroy.
People were nervous and unhappy.”

As the city regained composure, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh continued its own progressive
work.

Inspired by the NAACP and other local civil
rights organizations, like the Urban League, Pitt
established the department of black community
education research and development, now the Af-
ricana studies department

The department worked to bring black faculty
members and students to the University

David Epperson, a Pitt professor and dean of
socialworkfor30years,wasbornandraisedin
Pittsburgh But when he first came to Pitt as an
undergraduate, there was not a single black faculty
member, he said.

Now he holds his master’s and doctorate de-
grees£romPitt,andcivilrightsareafarnilyaffair

Epperson and his wife are lifetime members
of the NAACP, and for 10 years Epperson served
asthechairrnanof theboardfortheUrban
League in Pitmbutgh

Epperson’s youngest daughter; Lia Beth, is
married to the current president of the NAACP,
 Todd Jealous. The two met while in-
terning for the NAACP in New York, Epperson
said.

‘My children were a party to our discussions
at the dinner table every night, so they knew about
the problems,” said Epperson '

Many of the problems they discussed then
continue to exist today, although in less obvious
 he said

"Iherearesti1lmilestogowithprogress,there _

are still disctirninatiory practices that people may
have People may still be  for people of
color to move in to  neighborhoods and to
apply for and receive certain jobs,” said Epperson.

Epperson’s years of civil rights work influ-
enced Pitt

In 2002, Pitt established the Center on Race
and Social Problems through its School of Social
\Work_ It is the only center of its kind in the coun-
try studying the effects of race and ethnicity on
American life.

The establishment of a center that studies cur-
rent racial issues might seem progressive to some,
but its existence highlights the need for under-
standing the history of the civil rights movement;

But as one of the first black professors at Pitt,
Glasco sees a declining trend in black studies." P

During what he calls “the revolution,” when
people signed their letiiers, “Yours, in the struggle,’ ’
Glasco said, itwas impossible to keep some books,
like ‘ ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X,’ ’ in the li-
brary, because they would always be stolen.

The majority of his students read the book on
their own, because theywere awarethat they were

students are less aware of that history.

When Glasoo taught his black history survey
course for the ﬁrst time, there were about 200 stu-
dents, and “both sides of the classroom, in David
Lawrence, had to be opened up,” he said Now,
his course on the history of black Pittsburgh has
about 40 students

It is important that black people, and Ameri-
cans in general, remember the struggle, though,
he said

“[Students today] are standing on the shoul-
ders of many of the heroes of the NAACR They
got here because people marched and protested,
lost their lives and suffered insults to make the lib-
erties we have now possible,” said Davis

In addition to a year-long lineup of celebratory
events, the NAACP will issue “a major statement
about the future of the organization and its con-
 role in American society, said Epperson,

EDITORIAL

Business citations ignore

college drinking culture

In a move designed to stop peo-
ple younger than 21 from purchasing
beer, the Craig Distributing Co. has
closed its doors to anyone younger
than 25 after 4 p.m. on weekdays
and all day on Sunday. The business
already has a  of citations from
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board, and after a third the PPLCB
would revoke Craig Dist:tibuting’s li-
cense to sell alcohol

It’s a shame that a venerable
business like Craig Distributing has
to implement such drastic measures,
especially at a time when the econ-
omy is already  sales more
difficult Dean Rogers, the general
manager of Craig Distributing, es-
timated that in the two weeks since
the new policy was implemented,
the business has lost about $3,000 in
business each Friday night.

And while there’s nothing illegal
about the company’s actions, it does
make it more difﬁcult for people of
legal age to purchase alcoholic bev-
erages, especially those who live in
North Oakland.

All of this raises the question
of the underage  culture

in Oakland, as well as other college"

campuses in general While it cer-
tainly isn’t condoned behavior, it’s a
fact that underage  is rela-
tively common in and around Oak-
land. Colleges across the country
have been battling this fact rot years,
often with little success

The truth is that underage drink-
ing is at least in some part ingrained
into the culture of college as an in-
stitution. A vast majority of college
students start  before they
reach legal age, and a good number

of them attempt to buy their own
alcohol using fake IDS.

This shouldn’t come as any sur-
prise College students consist of
many intelligent and resourceful
people, and many of them have
money to spend and a fair amount
of free time. It’s not hard to imagine
that some students would put their
resources and ingenuity to 
or procuring IDs that can foil even
the best of the disttibutors’ counter-
measures.

The PLCB is obviously just try— F

ing to offer a standardized practice
by instituting a three—st:n'kes—you're-
out policy. But that might not be
the best case for a situation like
this Rather than a catch-all policy,
it could be fairer for the PLCB to
evaluate the process that distribu-
tors use to' catch people with fake
IDs and judge punishment based on
that. So, for instance, if a distributor
received its third citation, PLCB of-
ﬁcers could review its scanning pro-
cess to see if it’s up to snuff

If it is, perhaps only a ﬁne or
minor penalty would be in order,
whereas violators that blatantly
disregarded their responsibility to

It simply doesn’t seem fair to pe-
nalize a business, and to force it to
further penalize itself and its loyal——
and legal — customers because of
the actions of students with no re-
gard for the legality of their actions
But as long as underage  ex-
ists, so will underage buying, and the
PLCB should recognize that rather
than punishing it indiscriminately.

Oh, Blink, how We missed you

  
 

by Erik Hinton
Colummltt

“Blink-182 is back!” Mark
Hoppus, the band’s bassist, hol-
lered at the Grarnmys last week-
end. And with those seven short
syllables, 20—somethings across
the United States asked them-
selves what their age was again

anti began celebrating. I know

that for myself at least, the next
day was much like the day after
President Barack Obama won the
election or the Steelers clinched
the Super Bowl. Friends with
lip rings hugged without‘ saying
a word, uncharacteristic smiles
sat dumbly on the faces of class-
mates wearing Chuck Taylors and
the air was alive. “Do you know
what this means?” a boy sitting
next to me in a night class gid-
dily asked me. “No,” I said cooly,
“but, damn it, I cannot wait to
ﬁndout.”

Blink-182, one of the most
successful pop-punk groups of
the ’90s and early aughts, dis-
banded indeﬁnitely in 2005. After
the dismal side-project Angels
and Airwaves and drummer Tra-
vis Barker surviving not only a
reality television show but also a
deadly plane crash, things looked
dismal for Blink fans. just this fall
at a friend’s pop—pur_1k‘party, while
my roommate was crowd-surﬁng
to the Blink single “Dammit,” I
toasted the air. “Here’s to you,
Blink,” I said as the song played.
“It was fun while it lasted.”

Oh, me or little faith. ,

Blink’s comeback is not excit-

ing just because it was a central
element of my awkward youth.
Were that my only standard, I
would be avidly checking Aqua

, message boards and posting peti-

tions on MySpace to bring back
the Baha Men. No, the return
of the boys of 182 means two
things. First, we will soon have
a quite reliable way of measur-
ing how music has changed in
the past decade, and second, the

solemnity of modern music may
ﬁnally lighten up.

To take the first point first,
it is very unlikely that the mem-
bers of Blink—l82 have changed
at all. Into their 30s, Blink band
members were still titling albums
“Take Off Your Pants and Jack-
et” and penning lyrics such as,
“Unless your mom will touch
my c**k / I’ll never talk to you
again.” These are not high school
kids we are talking about. We can
likely expect that Mark, Travis

, and Tom are still the same foul-

mouthed, poppy songsters we
have always loved. I

If its music has changed at all
——- we will ﬁnd out this summer,
if its Web site is to be believed
— it will be because of changes
in the musical climate. We can
take Blink-182 as a sort of mu-
sical constant whereby we can
measure what shifts have taken
place on the pop-punk landscape
at large.

Worried fans of the genre

who have watched acts like the‘

once-great Green Day devolve
into mindless mouthers of rhet-
oric will finally be able to see if
pop-punk is indeed dead or if it
is just catatonic. Will Blink start
screaming and using double bass
pedals? Unlikely, but we cannot
be sure. This summer will be re-
velatory either way. 2

As for the second point, I ‘
think music has gotten far too se— _
-rious. Although we have tongue-

in—cheek offerings from Spank
Rock and comedy acts like Flight:
of the Concords, these have
been relegated to a category of
spectacle. Furthermore, none of
them can be considered punk in
the least. Most pop-punk out-
fits nowadays regard themselves
like they’re Beethovens with silly
bangs. My Chemical Romance
performs in marching band out-
ﬁts, Hawthorne Heights still actu-
ally exists, and even newer bands
have fused with hardcore and
taken on unintelligible names like
The Number Twelve Looks Like
You.

Blink—182’s irreverence is just
what such a scene needs. There is
nothing quite like three boys sing-
ing about male anatomy to lift
the veil of bands that sing about
apocalypse, the Virgin Mary
and weaponry Hopefully, pop-
punkers will take a cue about the
genre’s ironic roots —— such bands
as the Ramones and the Descen-
dents —— and I will no longer have
to go into malls ﬁlled with 14-
year-olds sporting jet-black locks
and talking about blood.

‘ However, with great expecta-
tions comes great danger. What if
the new Blink-182 album just isn’t
that good? What if it decides to
“go introspective” and I’m forced
to manhandle double entendres
out of ﬂaccid, confessional lyrics?
What if it adds a cello player and
starts writing songs about Canada
and politics? I’ll never be able to

dance like a pogo stick to another

Blink album again.

All I can do is hope this peti-
tion to. stay juvenile reaches the
ears of Blink-182. Avid Pitt News
readers though I’m sure they are,
such aspirations, I know, may be
unrealistic. Let this be a message
to the consumers, then. Ask for
your music to be fun again. Even
if Blink fails us, the news of its
reunion has reminded countless
adults of what made the music of
their youth great: a sense of hu-

mor. Perhaps someone else will
pick up the baton if Blink drops .

it. We can only pray.

dancer Alexandra Kqchis is a bit
of acrier.

But it’s hard to keep her cool
when she’s dancing through some
of the most emotionally draining
productions of all time —— and
this weekend, she’ll tackle one of
the biggest of them all: The bal-
let rewrite of Shakespeare’s clas-
sic,'titled in French “Romeo et
Juliette.”

“You can see [the piece] time"

and time again, and it still reduces
you to tears,” said Kochis. “Hu-
mans like to torture themselves,

path than that of her character
Juliette, albeit just as unexpected.

Though she’d been dancing _

since she was 5 years old, Kochis
never put balletat the forefront
of her life. She attended summer
programs as a teenager, but she
still had her eyes set squarely on a
college education.

And a good one at that —’

Koc-his applied and was accepted
to Georgetown University. But
when she was surprisingly of-
fered an apprenticeship with the
Boston Ballet School,‘ she knew
she couldn’t pass it up.

“I thought it was a once in a
lifetime chance — and‘ I’m still
dancing today. But I really fell

into it,-” she said. “A dancer’s ca; '

reer is so short-that it’s rare" one

‘ can go to school then dance pro-

fessionally afterward. I couldn’t
let it pass me by. But.I still could
go back to school today.”

Lil Wayne surprises fans

with transition to rock

by Justin Jacobs
A c.'>°E Editor

 

Every so often, an event tears through
the world of hip-hop with the force of a
F5 tornado "or Fat Joe sitting down.

Maybe it’s global warming, but recently
there’ve been too many of these game-
changing events to count — the stability of
hip—hop as we know it is melting as artist
after artist experiments with his tried and
true sound. 4

First Snoop Dogg abandoned rap for
cheesy, irresistible late ’70s funky coke-
disco with “Sexual Eruption.” Then Kanye
West left his lady of hip-hop and began
making rabbit—paced love to an auto—tune
machine, giving birth to 8085 and Heart-
break last winter. But the ‘most recent
tremor in hip—hop has been by far the most
staggering. -

Dr. Weezy F. Baby, or Lil Wayne to the

squares, abandoned rap to make a rock ’n"

roll record.

‘What in the hell is he doing? Didn’t he
just release the most successful rap album
of the year? Didn’t he just release the most

- successful album of the year in any genre?

The answer to the second two questions is
yes, but the first one is a good bit harder to
answer. The simplest way to do it, though,

. would be to do whatever the hell he,,wants.

On Jan. 27, Lil Wayne debuted “Prom
Queen,” the ﬁrst single off of his upcom-
ing rock record Rebirth. The track sounds
like the result of the guitarist from System
of a Down, the drummer from Linkin
Park, the rapper from, urn, Lil Wayne and
the auto—tune machine from every rap song
in the last six months drinking lots of Red-
bull, smoking a joint then trying to be po-
etic. Sound confusing? Well, it is.

To separate the song from its source is
simply impossible, as it would mean both
that approximately 99 percent of the peo-
ple who’ve listened to it never would’ve,
and it would negate the gigantic force Lil
Wayne has had on the music world in the
past year and a half.

So we’re left at an impasse, as the most
successful and talented (arguably most tal-
ented  I’m still waiting for Lupe Fiasco to
get his due praise)“rapper of theMySpace
era just dropped a big bomb of what—the-
hell-is-this on our collective-laps. It’s like
our probably reaction to a Coldplay rap re-
cord — the band is known for doing what
they do well, but how could we transpose
that sense of guaranteed quality to a com-
pletely new genre? ’ A

Then again, maybe that’s a bad example.
A Coldplay rap record would most assur-
edly be even weaker than a smack from
Chris Brown.

That said, the only way I see fit to re-
view “Prom Queen,” and thereby predict
how the next record from the year’s biggest
artist will be, is to do so thrice.

First, we look at “Prom Queen” as a

rock song. Compared to most rock songs,

that most rock fans would consider good,
“Prom Queen” is pretty decent (Note: not
indie. For our purposes, rock means main-
stream Linkin-Park—type business). Wayne’s
guitar sound is sharp and cutting, if not
overly complicated, and is certainly remi-
niscent of the minor key tinkering of "Sys-

tem of a Down. The percussion packs the -

same punch as the best of the late—’90s rap-
rock bands, sounding surprisingly in tim-
bre as those Christian metal dudes P.O.D. I
know, I think it’s weird too.

In the chorus, Wayne’s non—auto—tuned
shriek of “Prom Queenl!” is a genuinely
awesome bratty punk squeal, and the whole
thing is really quite catchy. So we’ve' got one
thumb sort of up.

Next, we look at “Prom Queen” as a Lil
Wayne song. This category is a lot tougher,
as Wayne has got some seriously fantastic

material. From his mixtapes to his guest V

appearances and studio albums, the guy has
a quality average of near—stellar. Lyrically,

‘Wayne certainly tackled a lot of tougher

topics than in “Prom Queen,” which is
mostly about sitting behind a girl with sexy
underwear in class. You know, to take a
peak. Though that’s,an admirable cause, we
know he could’ve done better because he
has so often. Thumb down.

Last, we look at the song as a Lil-Wayne-
doing—a-rock—song song, a category that’s
trickier still. Genre crossovers do deserve
some respect when done well, as “Prom
Queen” is. The man’s got to get credit for
playing and writing his own guitar part,
which isn’t half bad. And the shock value
of the song (“That’s Lil Wayne?!”) lasts
for awhile —— through about 15 plays. Ul-
timately, though, by 18 plays (when I’d ﬁ-
nally ﬁnished thiscolumn), the shock wore
off and I was left with a song that was just
alright. Thumb sideways.

There you have it — results inconclu-
sive. Then again, maybe that’s what Wayne
wants — a holdover record until he drops
his next atom bomb on us. We can only
hope.

Ballet, page 10

The decision proved a good one +- the

apprenticeship launched. Kochis into the

chance to study at such prestigious com-
panies as The Kirov Ballet Academy in
Washington DC and the School of Ameri-
can Ballet in New York City before dancing
professionally with Boston Ballet, a spot
she has held for 11 years.

It was in Boston that Kochis met her
future husband, fellow dancer Christopher
Budzynsk. The two began shopping around
for a new locale and, in 2006,_ both landed
jobs dancing in the (slightly) warmer city
of Pittsburgh. '

“It did require a bit of luck. But Pitts-
burgh was a good ﬁt for us — all the stars
really aligned,” said Kochis.

The stars have aligned again; Kochis

will dance as Juliet, one of her two favorite
ballet roles (the other is Adolphe Adam’s
“Giselle”). For its production of “Romeo
et Juliette,” the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater
aims to combine storytelling, music and
dance for a triple threat of emotional pow-
er. And Kochis promised that all three are
particularly potent.

“The scores to this ballet are some of

the best ever written. You can sit in your

February 12, 2009

living room and put this on, and you’ll just
cry. You’ll get goosebumps,” said Kochis,
referencing the productiorfs famous score
by Russian born Sergei Prokoﬁev.
“Combining that with the drama of the
story and the emotions are really distilled
down to their essense. A simple hand ges-
ture, the way two people stand there look-
ing at each other — it’s very humanistic

and natural,” said Kochis, promising that ,

even ballet novices will feel the impact of
the production. ‘

Ultimately, “Romeo et Juliette” makes
the classic dance right off the page, relayed
Kochis. i

“With the play, it takes a little bit of
concentration to get through those verses,”
she said. “But with the ballet you can see it
and just say, ‘\Wow.’”

The themes of the classic play do show
up, but just in a different medium, as move-
ment replaces mo_nologue.

“It’s bad timing, love lost, what could’ve
been, contrasting the pure joy and excite-
ment of ﬁnding your ﬁrst love, which is a
moment that everyone has,” said Kochis.

“The first moment there’s that mutual at— ‘

traction andejust that electricity.”

Croop leads Pitt, earns le

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta E9itor

Every day when Pitt senior
Alix Croop opens her locker, she
sees a list of personal goals. Later,
during practice, she sees them on
the wall again.

After this week, she’s one step
closer to reaching those goals.

A captain of the Pitt gymnas-
tics team, Croop was honored by
the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastic
League as the week’s best special-
ist for her performances against

Rutgers and Yale. It was the first \

time in her career that Croop

earned honors from the league.
Since a major goal of Croop’s

is to be a first-team all-league

performer, the honors from the
league means she’s certainly head-
ing in the right direction.

“It’s great -to be recognized

[because] I feel like in order to"

get the award you have to have a
great performance,” said Croop.

' And her performance over
the weekend not only earned her
honors, but helped Pitt (5-3) to
a first-place finish in a competi-
tion against Yale and Rutgers. She
earned first place on the uneven
bars and the beam, while col-
lecting fourth place on the floor
event.

Croop said that the biggest
change for her this year has been
experience, as she’s comfortable
in almost any situation.

“I think that being a senior
and having the experience now,
it’s really given me confidence,”
she said. “My first two years, I re-
ally only [competed] on the bar.”

And all personal goals aside,
her performances as of late have
helped Pitt realize what it can do
as a team.

After coming out on top of
two straight competitions, she
said the team as a whole is com-
ing together.

“I think the team is ﬁnally
starting to see our potential,” she
said. “We’ve been working really
hard to meet our goals this year.”

Pitt will face Maryland on Fri-
day night at the Fitzgerald Field

House.

Craig's List

Pitt ﬁlls voids with key recruits,
misses out on several others

by Kyle Craig
Stczﬂ IV/‘ital’

Feb. 4 was National I.etter of
Intent Day, the day that  school
football players from all around the
country ofﬁcially commit to their
respective universities. Over the
past few years, there’s been an un-
precedented increase in the number
and scope of recruiting services and
talent evaluators. The amount of
information available concerning
these high school athletes is enough
to make a casual fan’s head spin.

Fans that don’t have the time to
comb through dozens of scouting
reports on different Web sites can
ﬁnd a streamlined overview of Pitt’s
recruiting class right here

This past season, the Panthers
finished with the best record in the
Dave \X/annstedt era. But accord-
ing to multiple recruiting services,
Wannstedt and his staff followed up
their winningest season with their
most underwhelming recruiting
class. A lot of that can be attributed
to the number of scholarships Pitt

had available, as the Panthers only
signed 20 players last week.

Another factor that should be
taken into account before 
these evaluations too seriously is
the arbitrary star and point system
these recruiting services use Keep
in mind that Pitt defensive back An-
drew Taglianetti was rated a two-star
prospect by both Scoutcom and Ri-
vals.com. And despite those evalua-
tions, Taglianetti spent his ﬁeshman
season as an invaluable force on
special teams and as a member of
the Pitt two-deep roster. '

With that being said, Rivals.com
currently rates Pitt’s recruiting class
as the 47th best in the nation, while
Scoutcom has the Panthers ranked
at 31. Even the discrepancy between
these two sites indicates how rank-
ing recruiting classes is a less—than-
perfect science.

The class contains nine all-state
football players from Pennsylva-
nia and six players who have been
awarded some variety of an All-

3 American honor.

Here’s a look at several recruits
and the impact they might have
when next season begins.

Instant Irnpact
It’s not a coincidence that three

of the 20 Pitt signees are 
backs. The Panthers’ coaching staff

planned for LeSean McCo}fs depar-

ture, though it was nonetheless det-
rimental. Witll McCoy and LaRod
Stephens-Howling gone, these three
true freshmen will have an’ opportu-
nity to see early playing time:

. Raymond Gm/Jam (ﬁzfzabet/9, N
As the highest rated  back of
Pitt’s recruiting class, Graham will be
expected to make a strong push for
playing time. It will be interesting to
see if he can fight any carries away
from Shanff Harris, Kevin Collier
or Chris Burns, who all have experi-
ence in the Pitt system.

Pitt women look to take down No. 1 Connecticut

by Zack Chakan
Aaaidtant Sparta E9itor

It’s not often in sports that a team rid-
ing a seven-game winning streak has the
opportunity to pull off the biggest upset
of the season. On Sunday, the Pitt wom-
en’s basketball team gets that chance.

The Panthers venture northeast Sunday
to take on the vaunted No. 1 Connecticut
Huskies, who have yet to lose this year, at
3:30 p.m.

“Anytime you have the opportunity to

play No. 1 in the nation, it’s great,” said Pitt
coach Agnus Berenato. “Everybody wants
to play against the best and beat the best. It
gives you a gauge of where we are.”

Since losing twice during the beginning
of Big East play, No. 19 Pitt (18-4, 8-2 Big
East) has taken seven straight games to
merge into a three-way tie for second place
in the conference standings with Louisville
and Villanova.

But the Panthers’ stretch pales in com-
parison to the outright onslaught Con-
necticut has thumped on its opponents all

season. The Huskies have yet to experi-
ence defeat, winning every one of their 24
games.

Connecticut’s absolute dominance ex-

_udes from every game. The team’s small-

est margin of victory came in its season
opener against Georgia Tech, an 82-71 vic-
tory. In Big East play, a 15-point win over
DePaul is the Huskies’ smallest.

The Huskies seem to bring their best
against top competitors. In a showdown
against then-No. 2 North Carolina on Jan.
19, Connecticut whipped the Tar Heels in

Chapel Hill 88-58. Louisville, which held
the title of the Big East’s second-best

squad all season, lost to the Huskies by 28 i

a week later.

Connecticut possesses two of the best
players. in the nation, who could pose se-
vere threats to the Panthers’ defense.

Sophomore forward Maya Moore is a‘

near shoo—in All—American who averages
almost 20 points and about nine rebounds
per game. Senior point guard Renee Mont-
gomery tallies around 16 points a game,

while adding better than five assists per

no position more important than middle line-
backer. Mason appears to be a future star at
middle linebacker for Pitt, which is good, con-
sidering that the Panthers will be scrambling

to replace all—Amen'can Scott McKillop.
Rankings: Scoutcom: 4-star, Rivalscom:
4-star
S/Jane Gordon (lVe.tton, Fh): Considering
Pitt had to convert a wide receiver into a start-
ing outside linebacker last season, it wasn’t a
bad idea to snag another promising recruit at
linebacker. Gordon was a teammate of Jason
Douglas and, like Douglas, has been mak-
ing plays at one of the highest levels of high
school football in the country.
Rankings: Scoutcom: 3-star, Rivals.com:
3-star

Names to Remember _

Fernando Diaz is a hard—nosed player
from the Bronx. At 6 feet 2 inches tall and 275
pounds, Diaz might be a major factor on the
offensive line in a couple years. On the other
side of the ball, Tyrone Ezell is a tremendous

physical specimen who might turn into a pro-
liﬁc pass-rusher after a few seasons of coach-
ing.

The Ones that Got Away

Dorian Bell and Corgi Brown ﬂl/Ionroevi//cg Pa.
The recruiting “wall” that Warmstedt has talk-
ed about putting around Western Pennsylvania
doesn’t seem to be Tressel-proof. A year
after signing Cameron Saddler and Shayne
Hale from Gateway High School, \X/annstedt
lost both Bell and Brown to Ohio State.

jordcm Hill (Stee/ton, Pa. After wavering on
his commitment to Rutgers, it seemed like Hill
was Pitt—bound. But Penn State swooped in at
the last moment and picked up this promising
defensive lineman.

jorb Evan: (lrvingfon, N. Evans had offers.
from major college programs across the en-
tire country. Evans commitment would have

greatly changed the perception of this class. 4

However, he chose to travel down south to
the defending national champion Florida Ga-

weekend against UCLA, Texas,
Tennessee and Michigan — four
of the top teams in the nation.

When the meet was over; sev-
eral of Pitt’s performances stood
out and were just short of stand-
ing out even more.

“There was great competi-
tion,” said Pitt coach Alonzo
Webb. “Overall, it was a pretty
solid meet for us. [But] we still
have some things to work on.”

On the men’s side, junior dis-
tance runner Josh Christopher
ﬁnished third in the 5,000—me—
ter run with a time of 14:43.57,
which was less than ﬁve seconds
out of ﬁrst. The time broke his
previous season best by more
than 25 seconds. Junior Teddy

Miller placed behind Christopher, 7

ﬁnishing seventh.

Senior Eric Jones leapt 15.13
meters in the men’s triple jump to
ﬁnish in second place, just one-
hundredth of a meter shy of the
winner, BYU’s Aaron Powell.
Freshman Folarin Ijelu ﬁnished
ﬁfth.

“They stood out in the jumps,”
said Webb.

But while the jumpers stood
out, the men’s 4x400 team did the
opposite. During the relay, the
teamiwas disqualiﬁed for interfer-
ence and did not finish. During a

.handoff, a member of the team

was bumped. He pushed another
sprinter in an effort to brace his

/,

fall, causing the disqualiﬁcation.

“Indoors on the 4x4, [there]
is a lot of bumping and shoving
and pushing around,” said.Webb.
“Those things happen indoors
occasionally. It’s so tight, they’re
running that fast, they’re trying to
jockey for position.”

The women’s 4x400 relay team
fared better, ﬁnishing ﬁfth overall
with a time of 3:48.10.

Freshman Caitlin Cocilova
won her section in the women’s
500—meter run. Junior Patricia
Anyanwu ran a 1:18.12 in her
group but ﬁnished sixth. Seton

as

Overall, it was a pretty
solid meet for us.- [But]
We still have some
things to work on.

Alonzo

Webb

ft?

Hall’s Clarrise Moh highlighted
the event, breaking the meet re-

cord by nearly a second with a
1:12.04.

In the women’s 200—meter -

dash, sophomore Da’lynn Mills
won her preliminary heat, though
her 24.60 time left her just shy of

qualifying for the ﬁnals.

Of Pitt’s ﬁeld events partici-

pants, sophomore Sarah Ander-

' son stood out, distancing 14.92

meters in women’s throw. She ﬁn-
ished seventh in her ﬂight.

Season bests were the story
in the women’s 800—meter run.
Freshman Susan Martinez ran a
2:17.48, and junior Kari Hedder-
ick ran a 2:18.78. Hedderick ﬁn-
ished third in her section, while
Martinez ﬁnished sixth in a com-
petitive grouping.

Two freshmen on ‘ the men’s
side came close to topping their
best collegiate times, as well.
Dontave Cowsette ran a 1:57.96
in the 800—meter run, his season’s
second best time. Greg Kareis
ﬁnished within ﬁve seconds of
his lowest time in the mile, plac-
ing seventh in his section. Kareis
also competed in the 1000—meter
run and ﬁnished fourth in his
group.

“We have a pretty young team,
both the men’s and women’s
side,” said Webb. “I just wanted
to get there, get a little of our
nerves out and get some high lev-
el competition before we go into
the [Big East] championship.”

Webb added that the meet acts
as a warm—up for the Big East In-
door Track and Field Champion-
ships, which, like the New Bal-
ance Collegiate Invitational, takes
place at the Armory Track &
Field Center in New York City.

“I wanted to give the athletes
a chance to get on that facility
and get acclimated to the facility,”
said Webb. “Just [to get] a sort of
comfort for it when we go back
in a couple weeks.” '

game.

At 6-foot-4, junior center Tina
Charles gives’ the Huskies three
elite scorers. Charles ﬁnishes with
better than 15 points per contest.
Pitt will also have to deal with the
hostile Connecticut crowd.

“\When you play on their cam-
pus, they’re‘on top of you,” said
Berenato of the crowd. “And it’s

sold_out. It’ll be 11,000 strong, a
great environment.”

Playing on the road or not, the
blazing Panthers could provide
the toughest test for the Huskies
until the Big East tournament.
Pitt’s All—American candidate
Shavonte Zellous has produced
remarkably consistent numbers
during Pitt’s seven—game streak,

averaging 23.6 points in that span,
matching her overall numbers for
the season.

Pitt scared Connecticut in the
teams"meeting at the Petersen
Events Center last year. The Pan-
thers led more than 12 minutes
into the game, but the Huskies
zipped past the young team for

the remaining 28 and won 90-64.
