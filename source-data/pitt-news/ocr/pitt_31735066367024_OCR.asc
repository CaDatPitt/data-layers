 HEP Gets Federal Aid;
Had Fought for Grant

  For Several Years,

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The “demands” of the Hill
District ‘ Citizens’ Committee

that the Hill Education'Proj- .

J ect' (HEP) financed result-

<3‘



. grant,

4 ing itself.

ed in an approximately $22,-
000 grant to HEP from the
Office of Economic Opportunity
(OEO), according to HEP Chair-
fnan Earl Trent. ’

Trent explained that HEP has
been waiting for a. grant since
its inception a few years ago.
Last week the organization re-
ceived notiﬁcation that it had
been awarded a grant from the
federal government.

Trent pointed out that the
money was “speciﬁed for certain

. things, such as the rental of a

tutoring facility, a full-time sec-
retary, a janitor, and a full-time
community coordinator.” He add-
ed that “no student in the proj-
ect is getting paid; HEP is still
a volunteer organization.”

- The positions of janitor and
secretary have been ﬁlled, Trent

'noted, but —- interviewing for the

community coordinator will not

it begin until July.

Trent explained that he and
HEP’ Co-chairman Mary Bufwack
have _the responsibility of hiring

the I-IEP employees and that an _

advisor from Hill House sits ‘in
on the interviews for the appli-
cants. The selected people are
under the supervision of the stu-
dent leaders of the organization,
Trent said.

- ‘Now that HEP has received its
Trent stressed that its
next move would be to concen-
trate on HEP’s “problems within
the University.” Trent pointed

out that “after Dave Epperson

(coordinator of the Equal Educa-
tional Opportunities Program)
left the University, HEP became
a victim of several unfavorable
University actions.” ' ,
Trent cited a few instances
where he felt HEP was dealt with
unfairly: “A typewriter which
had been purchased for HEP and
used by the HEP staff for two
years, was taken by the adminis-
tration to be used in another of-
ﬁce. According to Bob Loch, the
typewriter was to be used by
HEP until someone else. in the
University needed it.” ‘

Another example of “mistreat-
ment” of HEP was the recruit-
ment restriction, Trent said: “We
found ourselves in trouble recruit-
ing in the Towe_rs, because of a

new rule ‘limitinggroups to only

two days for recruiting.”

This was followed by another
clash: “Due to a reactivated rule
governing use of the Student

"Union building, HEP members

who were not University stu-
dents could not obtain admission
into our office. Finally, we were
informed that we ‘are not eligi-
ble for any University privileges,
because we have never. been of-
ﬂcially recognized as a student
activity.”

.Trent pointed out that the

above incidents led to the follow-

ing move: “After meeting with_

Dean Rush, we decided to accept
the whole affair as ludicrous and
work out the existing problems

(with her personally.” He empha-

sized that “I-IEP has been func-
tioning in the University for four
years, and the University has
claimed HEP in; ﬁlms and arti-
cles throughout these years.”',

Students for Peace Attack    
Rushes Decision On ROTC  

The refusal of Dean of
Students Helen P. Rush to
call a special Orientation
Committee meeting to dis-
cuss the role of ROTC in the

Orientation Program has .

triggered a chain of negative re-
actions from participants in the
controversy. _ .

Commenting on the decision to
cancel the meeting, Students for
Peace (SP) Treasurer Frank Cou-
vares pointed out, “Miss Rush

conveyed the impression to me A

that she thought it was a very
admirable thing to develop dia-
logues between students and the
administration, and that this
meeting would be a manifesta-
tion of that kind of open discus-

' sion. By calling off the meeting,

she substantiated all the charges
ofiher critics and proved to me
that she has no respect for stu-
dents’ opinions and is really not
interestediin establishing a dia-
logue.

When asked what he thought‘
‘the results of-this decision would
be, Couvares stated, “She (Miss
Rush) is forcing students to take
extra-legal measures.” He added
that in a telephone conversation
with Miss "Rush, he pointed out
to her that “by calling of! the!

;

“No” on Meeting

meeting, she may be forced to
call it in the future.”

SP President Bill’ Weber re-
marked, “Miss Rush has blocked
the most reasonable and rational
course of action for SP to ques-
tion ROTC ‘orientation status.”
He emphasized, “Miss Rush’s ar-

side of the common sense chan-
nels. I. cannot say what SP. will
do until our next meeting, which
is scheduled for tomorrow.”
Couvares felt that Dean Dush’s
decision to cancel the meeting

.was a “parallel example of- the

      

rogance of power forces SP out-‘

Leaves For France

Prof. Gets (“Surprise

By BERN! McLEOD

I A month ago, if , someone
asked" Dr. Joseph A. "Mas-
tronie, associate professor of
romance languages, what he
would be doing.this sum-
mer, "he -would have re-
plied, “teaching at Pitt.” To-.

teach a methods course for a

French, Spanish and Italian, was
recommended for the job by Dr.

the .University’s Foreign Lan-

‘Waiting For Godot’ G

The University Theatre
has built its ﬁne reputation
primarily with plays from an
earlier age‘: Shakespeare,
Moliere, Johnson, and Schil-

ler- are the authors of a few of ,

the more recent undertakings.
Waiting for Godot then, is a sharp
departure from the usual offer-
ings, but one which is far from
being - routine theatre entertain-

’ ment.

What, takes place on stage is

a comedy, yet the basis for the,

laughter is hardly a laughing
matter. There exists no engage-
ment, but merely .a succession of
isolated, notes endlessly repeat-

In short, the -play is about
nothing, and it depends, there-
fore,’ on how well the actors can
make us sympathize with their
plight. ‘It rests with the director
to convey to the audienceithe

underlying pathos and ‘poetry of

-the situation.

The actors, with the exception
of Jeffrey Hart, are all familiar
to University audiences, and for
once we can see them in a natur-
alistic, rather than heavily styl-
ized, drama. James Berry, who
has improved so phenomenally
over the last two years, turns in
a commanding ‘characterization

Lucky although his speech lacks
polish. , H " .

Harvey Miller, in the impor-
tant role of Pozzo, is more than

ages the important switch from

His foil in’ the part of Vladi-
mir, Jeffrey Hart, is excellent, ex-
cept for several ill-timed punch
lines which he tends to throw
away. His many moments of iron-
ic humor, however, are usually
handled with just theright touch
of sardonic drollness. I '

The entire production, from
sets and lights to the consistent-
ly high level of acting, is another
well deﬁned attempt to present
the University community with
a thought-provoking, but always
entertaining dramatic experience.

In exchange. for streetcar
fare,’ or some brisk exercise,
a University student might
find Pittsburgh a pretty in-

The Pittsbugh Playhouse,

Activities Are For You

By HOWARD AINISMAN

(Mr. Ainisman is vice-president of
Student Government, a member of
Druids honor society and a former
chairman ofvFreshmen Orientation.)

Why do some students
spend so much time in stu-
dent activities? Perhaps I
can shed some light on this
issue. I feel that student
activities are a giving out
instead of a “taking in.”"‘In
the classroom I sit and ab-
sorb knowledge through lectures

and movies; in student activities
I can give out.”

It's like a person who tries to ,

learn to play golf by reading
every book in the library on the
subject but really has no idea
until he hooks his ﬁrst drive or
misses his short putt. The stu-
dent who goes from his room to

his class to the cafeteria and -

back to his room again "or the one
who comes in the morning by
trolley and leaves in the after.-
noon immediately after his class-
es, like our textbook golfer, does
not know what student life is.
He lives in a vacuum.

Student activities provide a
source of identification for an in-
dividual. I often hear the phase_,
‘‘I’m just another number on an
IBM card.” Student activities can

make you an individual. A num- .

ber doesn't tutor a Negro child;
a number doesn't sit in front of
a typewriter mulling over a lead
for a news story; a number does

not spend four hours decorating
a_ ballroom for a dance; a num-
ber does not stay away from a
football’ game when it’s 15.de-
grees and there's snow on the
ground.

Student activities keep you
from being a“‘provincial student.”

He is the student who is locked.

in his own discipline. A sociology
major just as the engineer can
insulate himself in his narrow
specialty. He socializes, studies
and converses within his own
narrow circle. -Student activities
allow him to “break into the
clear.” Now he has an open ﬁeld
to cover. I

You can learn skills through
student programs that you can

-use later in life. As a president

of a student organization or as

the chairman of an event you_
must by necessity learn to chair.
‘a' meeting using Robert’s Rules

of Order. This will come in han-
dy for you in a PTA meeting, a

committee meeting of the United.

Fund or a Chamber of Commerce
convention. Financial know-how
can be learned, which will be in-
valuable in your professional life,.
when you write up a corporation
report.

You can grow as a person as a
result of your student participa-
tion. You assume responsibilities

in a light that you must fulﬁll‘

them. YOU get to see the Univer-

sityin a light that isn't seen by
the non participant student. And"

most importantly, you learn t

work with others. -

Full Tuition Reduction
Proposed by Scranton
Awaiting Senate Vote

Confused about the fate of your future alma mater?
Most people are these days. But a review of the events of
the past week can make clear where Pitt stands in its at-
tempt to become a state-related institution. '

FGOV. William Scranon agreed last Wednesdayto sign
legislation which would reduce the Pitt tuition to $450 per
year for all ‘full-time students. There had been some talk
that the tuition might be just for freshmen, undergraduate
students, etc. However, Scranton’s proposals lower tuition

Dept. Gives
Health Aids A
To Students

Although the Student Health
Service places an emphasis on in-
dividual health care and on
others to full-time students are
signiﬁcant and should be familiar
to all students.

Injuries (except old and chron-
ic ones) will be cared for by the
Health Service, however, visits
for any other ‘kind of emergency
can be made at any time. Visits

for non-emergency medical" care-
or advice can be arranged by.

making an appointment either by_
telephone (ext. 518) or by con-
tacting the receptionist in the
Health Service office, Bracken-
ridge Hall.

Doctorls hours are held with-
out an appointment on Satur-
days, Sundays, and holidays for
students with problems needing
professional attention before the
regular ‘weekday. "These
hours are posted in" the service
and on various bulletin boards
throughout the University.

There is no inﬁrmary main-

tained by the Health Service, and .

it neither provides nor pays any
costs associated with bed care.
However, when the Student
Health Service is caring for a
student living in a University res-
idence hall who needs bed care
other than available ‘in the resi-
dence hall, it will arrange if pos-
sible for all aspects ofbed care
in one of the Medical Center

hospitals.

> While Scranton has given his

approval to the legislation, the
bill has not been passed by the
Republican controlled State. Sen-
ate. A Pitt bill has been passed
by the House. The majority lead-
ers of the Senate announced
Tuesday that they would notact
until the general appropriations
bill is passed. They say that by
their interpretation of the State
Constitution all prefered legisla-.

tion (i.e. general appropriations) --

must be settled before non-pre-
ferred legislation like the Pitt bill
can be voted on.

' >The general appropriations
bill is being held. up because of
a. ﬁght between the Democratic
controlled‘ House and the Repub-
lican led Senate over the means
of distributing state funds.

' > The next step to solving the
appropriations dispute is the call-
ing of a joint House-Senate con-

ference committee to iron out”
. differences. The earliest this con-

ference committee can be called

is sometime after June 28 when '

the House, lreconvenes after a,

week’s vacation. '
>‘Although _the State Senate

has failed to act on the Pitt leg-

islation, State Senator Leonard’ .

C. Staisey (Dem.-Duquesne) sug-
gested that a joint conference he
held between ‘members of the
House and Senate and Governor
to formulate public announce-

' ment on Pitt appropriation. Sen-

ate _-Appropriations Committee
Chairman Sen. Robert Fleming

(Rep.-Aspinwall) supported Stai-’

sey's move.

" >1-louse, Majority -Leader Jos-
hua Eilberg (Dem.-Philadelphia)
stated last Tuesday, “We are
adamant in our intention’ that
the University of Pittsburgh and
its students be granted the same
status and advantagesas were
granted to Temple and Penn
State." .
