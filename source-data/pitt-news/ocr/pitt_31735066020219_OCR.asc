.Chief William Moore ~ from the
Pittsburgh Police Department met
with Gary Moses, head of Pitt's Pub-
lic Safety Department, on Friday to
discuss ways that students can im-
prove the security of their apartments.

The original purpose of the meet-
ing was to review the investigation of
a rape and recent burglaries that end-
ed when a 15-year-old Schenley High
School student was arrested for the
crimes.

Their attention focused on students
living in off-campus apartments,
mainly those in the Oakland area.

Although this investigation is com'rn'g"

to a close, students should still take
precautionary measures to protect
themselves.

”One thing that we [the police]
have noticed is that when students
notice something wrong or amiss in
their apartments, they first call one of
their friends, then they notify the
police,” said Moses.

Moses believes this drastically cuts
down on police effectiveness and
their abiltiy to track the criminal
whereabouts.

Both Moore and Moses feel that

students should always inform the

police immediately when they real-
izejthat something is missing or that
someone has broken into their
apartment.

Moses also suggests that students

Before signing their

lease, students should _i

— Gary Moses

make sure that their doors and win-
dowsiare locked when they go out
and even when they are at home. A
small block of wood is a good way
to jam a window shut to keep it from
being opened from the outside.
Students are still being warned to

“walk on well lit streets at night and

to try not to walk alone.

To help students, one of Pitt’s
fraternities, Lambda Chi Alpha, has
begun an escort service to accompa-
ny students on campus and in south
Oakland. Pitt's Student Government
Board is also looking over plans to
begin their own escort service.

”Before signing their lease, all stu-
dents should check the security of the
apartment," said Moses. ’’If the lease
specifies security that is lacking or not
there, the students should call the
housing authorities." ‘

Black Week  

Students celebrate culture

By Milt Klopfer

Staff Writer

Pitt's 17th annual Black Week be-
gan Sunday evening with Gospel
Night, setting off a week of programs
designed to educate, entertain and in-
volve the black community.

The week-long event, sponsored
by the Black Action Society, was or-
ganized under the direction of the

"Black Week chairperson Michael

Cawthorn and programming chair-
person Shelia Beasley.

This year's theme is ”We’re Black
By Popular Demand!” According to
Beasley, the phrase is not just a play
on words but also reflects the
popularity of black issues on campus.

Cawthorn said the phrase also
reflects the diversity of the activities
scheduled for the week. The phrase
does not reflect any one specific
issue. ' ~ . ’

All events, except for Thursday's
lecture at David Lawrence Auditori-
um, will take place in the William Pitt
Union. They are free to the public.

According to Cawthorn, Gospel
Night was the biggest such event to
occur at Pitt.

upper 40's.

The two-and-a-half hour concert
featured four traveling gospel choirs
and Pitt's own ”Some of God's Chil-
dren” gospel choir.

Today at noon, a workshop entitled
”Leadership, Success and Survival
Skills” will be held under the direc-
tion of comedian, poet and scholar
Dennis Watson.

Watson is a ”cross between Bill-

Cosby and Jessie Jackson,”-Cawthorn
said. He uses a serio-comic approach
to educate students about the skills
and knowledge needed to succeed
academically, professionally and so-
cially.

Watson has appeared at every
‘major black college in the country
and has even appeared at the White
House before President Reagan.

At 8 p.m. Watson will lecture and

do a skit in which he does an impres-
sion of the the first black U.S. presi-
dent. Theskit, though a farce, is
expected to raise some serious
points.

Tuesday, editor-in-chief of Essence
magazine Susan Taylor will lecture

at 4 p.m. in the WPU Ballroom. Tay-
lor is also a professional model. '

Shultz could resign over U.S. arms shipments to Iran

NEW YORK — Secretary of State
George Shultz could resign over the
United States’ reported secret in-
volvement in arms shipments to Iran,
according to aides to the secretary cit-
ed in The New York Times Sunday
editions.

The State Department had opposed
covert contacts with Iran and had
been deliberately denied information
about the matter, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified administration
officials.

Shultz finds his position particular-
ly undercut because he had assured
a meeting of Arab foreign ministers
on Oct. 1 that the United States was
doing all it could to halt the shipment

: of arms to Iran, State Department offi-

cials told the newspaper.

One aide told The Times that ”if
the secretary is going to resign over
something, this would be it.” But the
aide said he did not know what
Shultz intended to do.

The Times, The Washington Post
and the Los Angeles Times have all
reported that Iran helped arrange,
through Israeli contacts, the release
of Americans held in Lebanon in ex-
change for shipments of U.S. arms.

$15,000 reward
offered for baby

SELLERSVILLE, Pa. — More than

$15,000 in reward money was
offered Saturday for the safe return of
a day-old boy who was taken from
his mother's bedside by a woman
posing as a hospital worker.

An anonymous donor offered a
$5,000 reward for the safe return of
the baby to a medical facility, said
Dorothy Gehres, an assistant ad-
ministrator at Grand View Hospital.

A televised appeal seeking reward
money for the baby's return had
raised another $10,200 by 7 p.m.,
said Scott Worthington, the infant's
uncle.

Both rewards are only for the return
of the baby and not for information
about the woman who took him.
”We’re not interested in that,”
Cehres said.

The hospital set up a hotline for
people to call with any tips regard-
ing the abduction Friday afternoon.

Musician arrested after
bomb threat aboard jet

HOUSTON —- A jetliner with 40
people aboard made an unscheduled
landing Saturday morning after a pas-

nio to Philadelphia with a church
singing group, was charged with in-
terference with the operation of an
aircraft and interference with a flight
crew, FBI spokesman Johnnie Joyce
said.

Shortly before 7 a.m., the pilot on
Flight 64 radioed Houston's Intercon-
tinental Airport to report a threat to
blow up the Boeing 727 aircraft,
Joyce said.

Dukes, a keyboard player with the .
group from Macedonia Baptist
Church of San Antonio, was drunk
and became angered when the flight
crew would not serve him an alco-
holic beverage, said Houston avia-
tion' department spokesman Bill
Ainsworth.

USAir does not serve alcoholic
drinks until 9 a.m., Ainsworth said.

When the plane landed in
Houston, it was taken to a remote
area where water trucks were wait-

ing. Dukes was arrested without in- _

cident, and some "of the 35
passengers and five crew members
on board were questioned, Ain-
sworth said.

Each charge carries a maximum

fine of $10,000 and 20 years in pris-
on, Joyce said.

Prosecutor wants death

for bombing

BE,lRUT,- Lebanon — Military
prosecutor Assad Diab has demand-
ed the death penalty for six Lebanese
accused of engineering the 1983 sui-
cide bombing at the U.S. Embassy
that killed 62 people, Diab’s office
said Saturday.

A Diab spokesman, who demand-
ed not to be further identified, said
all six were Shiite Moslems arrested
by the army after the April 18, 1983,
bombing in Moslem west Beirut.

Diab also issued arrest warrants for
eight others in connection with the

bombing, the spokesman said with- ’

out elaborating. _

An indictment issued Friday said
the six men now in custody rigged a
stolen U.S. Embassy van with 660
pounds of explosives in Zahrani, in
south Lebanon, a few days before the
attack, the spokesman said.

According to the indictment, the
van then was brought to Beirut where
a suicide driver crashed it into the en-
trance of the embassy building at Ein
Mreisseh Boulevard.

The explosion tore off the entire fa-
cade of the eight-story embassy
compound. '

Tired of hamburgers? Try horseburgers S

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) —— Ron
Corn sees it as his duty to‘ educate
people about horses.

He thinks Americans should eat
them.

Corn has sold horseburgers in Man-
hattan, horse steaks to Navy commis-
saries and horse roasts in the West.
But due to pressure from U.S. hu-
mane societies, his‘ main market is

abroad.

Corn, the owner of M&R Packing
Co. and Marco International in Hart-
ford and South Carolina, said: -”Na-
tionwide, I would guess 25 percent
would eat it [horse meat] without ad-
vertising. An educated public would
eat more.” . '

Student rescued after
four days in air duct

LOUISVILLE, Ky. —- A student was
rescued Saturday from an air duct in

a building at the University of Louis-_

ville after apparently being stuck
since Tuesday night.

Rescuers worked for two hours be-
fore freeingJerry Livers, 19, of Loret-
to, from the base of the air passage
in the school's humanities building.

Livers was in stable condition
Saturday night at Humana Hospital
Audubon. He suffered a broken arm
and ribs after tumbling about 40 feet,
officials said.

He told police that he could not
remember how he ended up in the
air duct. However, the student's
friends told authorities that Livers had
explored similar areas in campus
buildings when he felt bored.

Livers was discovered Saturday
when a faculty member in a third-
floor restroom of the humanities
building heard a call for help com-
ing from a mechanical room. The

teacher alerted authorities, who A

found Livers in the passageway

Low turnout fo

SGB is a shame

Out of all who pass through the William Pitt Union or the Towers
lobby, why is it that only 2,174 of you bothered to vote in last week's
student government elections?

Granted, SGB doesn't interest a lot of people, but it should. Those
people who were elected on Thursday will make decisions that af-
fect you. They are the ones who decide who gets to spend your stu-
dent activities fee. They are the official voice of the student body at
Pitt — whether or not they say anything is a different matter. So next
time, instead of getting angry about how things are run, do some-
thing about it by voting.

English shouldn't
take a back seat

The question: What's the official language of the United States?
The answer: There isn't one. Everyone assumes that it's English, but
a trip to Miami or Los Ange|es,'or a walk down Atwood Street will
tell you differently. There is no problem with the fact that many of
the people who reside in this country speak languages other than
English. ‘That's to be expected and accepted in a land with the repu-
tation for being a ”melting pot.”

Immigrants have been pouring into the United States for centuries.
We are the product of those who came to this country in hopes of
finding something better. Nothing has changed. This is still the land
of opportunity and, with enough time and hard work, anyone can
become a success.

In the days of Ellis Island, people from all over the world entered
this country. They settled and set to work on the American dream.
First they found places to live, they found jobs, and then they worked»
tirelessly to improve their lots in life. That still happens. There is one
little difference now.

In the days of old, new immigrants to this country knew that the
only way they could ever begin their rise to the top was to learn Eng-
lish. Aside from being a requirement for becoming naturalized
citizens, a working knowledge of English was necessary for daily liv-

for getting by in this country were conducted exclusively in English.
All were free to hold on to the culture that each brought with him

' to this new country, but each also had to acclimate himself to main-

stream American life.

That really doesn't happen anymore. English is still a requirement
for citizenship, but now it's possible to vote, take a driver's test or
even get an education in the language of your choice. Some cities
have multilingual street signs and government offices. There are
school districts where bilingualism is a requirement for teachers.

All of this sounds fine, at first. It seems as if Americans are becom-
ing more tolerant of non-English—speaking people. Some applaud what
they see as a move toward becoming a full-fledged bilingual society,
and they point to Canada as a model for how well something like
this can work.

Take a good look at the current situation in Canada, though. The
French—speaking citizens hate the English—speaking citizens, and vice
versa. The French threaten to secede at least once a year. French Cana-
dians don't refer to themselves as Canadians, but as French Canadians.

'It's already happening here, too. Having to learn English to get by
was a major inconvenience, but in learning to speak it, we became
unified. The unofficial bilingualism in this country is undermining
the unity of,,our ‘people.

There is nothing wrong with speaking your native tongue; i.t keeps
you in touch with your past. But at the same time, speaking English
keeps you’ in touch with your present. - ~

.’ ',..~- -,   ,‘.

   

 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, I986‘

 

The theme for Veterans Day, "We|-
come Home,” is an idea which origi-
nated locally before catching on
nationwide. There is an emphasis on
Vietnam veterans this year, as they re-
main the only group of heroes who
never received a proper congratula-
tions. As a Vietnam era veteran my-
self, I'm still waiting for some
recognition.

A lot of us still have some ghosts
to lay,to rest. Millions of us were
drafted, conditioned to do what we
were told without question, taughtto
kill, then sent to a faraway land
where a war was being waged
against people who had never at-
tacked the United States. It was,‘ for
the most part, our country's poor peo-
ple who were sent to Vietnam to do
our government's dirty work. Fat
bureaucrats in Washington rarely
worried about their sons being can-
non fodder in that violent extension
of politics. The unfortunates sent
there were poor whites, poor blacks
and poor Hispanics. They're the ones
who caught bullets with their fragile
bodies; they're the ones who had the
wrath of a legal system to contend
with if they questioned or refused to
wage a war that was never declared.

Years later, our government still
shrouds much of its actions behind
a cloak of secrecy. Covert action is
as commonplace today as it was 20

W must She:/er forget  

years ago. Occasionally, someone
slips information about some ques-
tionable act to the press and a ”plau-
sible denial” is issued by our
government. Nothing changes. Mid-
dle Americans never complain — as
long as it's not their _sons getting
killed in militarism. It's always the
poor.

However, Vietnam veterans are
ceasing to be the scapegoats for our
government's foreign policy. They
did as they were told, much the same
as any other soldier would. Years
later, these angry men and women

what happened to them, a catharsis
in effect. In time, they will learn that

folks who were never in service are
angry at their former employers, an-
gry at how they were manipulated
and lied to.

In Pittsburgh, we have a lot of vete-
rans groups, Amvets and Vietnam
Vets |nc., just to name a few. I'd real-
ly like to see a nationwide coalition

of all of these groups, but that will :

take a while and some effort. Then,
"maybe we will have a proper lobby-
ing element in Washington, not just
lip service from politicians who
would curry our votes.

I spoke with T.J. McGarvey, the vet
in charge of the Allegheny County
Veteran's Memorial. He doesn't see
funding coming from Washington for
our memorial here. He needs
$739,000 to build the memorial, but
has only raised $1 10,000. The mem-
orial, which resembles a chapel, sym-
bolizes peace, regeneration and
rebirth. It is both positive and mature,
for the memory of both the living and
the deceased. It has nothing to do
with the Rambo image infecting our
children. It is part of a helping, heal-
ing process. ”We remember,” it
seems to say.

Biloen article was poor

I take extreme exception to the ar-
ticle by Matthew Thornton concern-
ing the death of Professor Paul Biloen
in the Oct. 31, 1986 issue of The Pitt
News. The headline read, -"Pitt
Chemistry Professor Jumps Off
Bridge." This headline, I feel,

represents a form of journalism I

would expect to see in The National

,Enquirer and other comparable tab-

loids. Its preoccupation with sensa-
tionalism is excessive. To say that it
is in poor taste is not adequate.
Next, Professor Biloen was a mem-
ber of the chemical and petroleum
engineering department and not the
chemistry department. Finally, the ar-
ticle was full of factual errors. A prin-
cipal investigator is not the principle
investigator, the project supported by
the NSF is a study of ammonia syn-
thesis, not amino synthesis, and the
last name of the faculty member in

.our department is Goodwin, not

Goodin. - ‘

Response to Posvar

Posvar’s spirited defense of the
board of trustees’ decision not to

divest (The Pitt News, Oct. 31),

neglects to tell the university commu-
nity that he and 12 other members
of the board (out of a total of 36) were
identified last year by a reporter for
The Pittsburgh Chronicle as being on
the board of directors or chief execu-
tive officers of corporations that con-
tinue to do business in South Africa.
This may cast a slightly different light

on the stance of disinterested altru-.

ism the president assumes in his
column.

It's a bit ironic to find President
Posvar in the same column slapping
IBM and General Motors on the wrist
for divesting soon after the Pitt deci-
sion. Could it be thatthe Pitfboard
of trustees got _caught_ napping on this

     

one, that the more successful and far-
seeing sectors of U.S. business have
shifted to a pro-divestment position?

We should remember that the last.

great "achievement" of Pittsburgh's
corporate elite that is so amply
represented on our board of trustees
was its abandonment of the steel in-
dustry. These are the people in whom
we've vested the future of this
university?

Finally, the president attacks the
idea of a referendum on divestment
as contrary to ”the right to hold and
express individual views.” [...] But

every representative university group ‘

that has considered this issue, includ-
ing the Faculty Senate and the SG B,
has come out overwhelmingly in
favor of divestment. The only excep-
tion is the trustees, who were elect-
ed by no one. Why is the only right
that counts at Pitt the right of Posvar
and the board of trustees to their
opinion? [...]

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 9, 1986

New phone systems don't haveto hurt

I constantly resistchange, so when
the word went out that our news-
paper office was going to get a new
telephone system, I fretted and
sulked.

”There's nothing wrong with the
old system,” I said.

Cooler heads told me that this was
the same thing I always said every
time we changed phone systems.

"But I'm finally learning how to use
the old system," I said. "Now I have
to learn a whole new system.”

Cooler heads told me that it was
really very easy.

So I went to the training sessions
for the new telephone system, and I
tried my best to understand. I knew
I was going to hate the new system.

But something happened. The new
system has a feature that makes me
feel as if I have been presented with
a wonderful toy.

In short, it is this:

With the new system, if you push_

a certain button, you don't even have
to pick up the telephone receiver to
talk. You just talk into the air and
then, as if by magic, the person
whom you are talking to answers you
back, right through the air.

I realize that speakerphones are not
the newest idea on Earth, but they are

South Africa — expose yourself to the truth 

It has been most refreshing to see

I the recent increase in coverage and

debate on the problem of apartheid
in South Africa. It makes me feel very
good to see letters and columns de-
bating the value of a policy for divest-
ment of holdings in corporations that
do business there. Regardless of the
column’s content, it was quite heart-
warming to see Wesley Posvar, presi-
dent of the university, take the time
to write a column to express his
views on the subject.

As a member of Students for a Free

South Africa, I see this all as positive, .

because it shows people are thinking.
Ideally, a debate in the print media
gives readers a chance to become in-
formed on the issues and raise their
awareness to a level that enables
them to work or vote in an informed
manner, one that can "promote
change.

Ideally, this result is an important
goal of any protest movementgand
hopefully all of the-people who have
helped build and staff the shanty are

r . proud of the accomplishments in this

area. I know I am.

Oh Mom, if you could see me
now, I'm certain you would smile
and shake your head in amusement.
|’never truly appreciated your cook-
ing until I left for college.

"Last Friday for my supper I attempt-
ed to prepare a meal consisting of
marinated roast beef, creamed brus-
sel sprouts, wild rice and cranberry

sauce, topped off with a bottle of Paul ’

Masson Rose. I figured I could make
as good a meal as you used to make
on Sunday afternoons after we
returned from church services. Boy,
was I wrong. '

The cranberry sauce was easy
enough to prepare. All I had to do
was open the Ocean Spray can and
dump the contents into a small bowl.
The rest of the meal, however,
plunged downhill after that.

I first tried to trim the fat from the
foot-long hunk of roast beef I bought
at the local supermarket. I cut off all
the fat around the edge of the meat
and then cut it through the middle to
get at a thin streakof fat in its center.
That's when Idiscovered the lumps
of fat hiding inside the meat. Using
a paring knife, I tried diggingout
those lumps, but after removing each

lump still more fat would ..showgup-

behind it. 1" . ..
By the" time I was through trimming
fat-, all I had left were six bites of roast

pretty new around newspaper offices.
When I used to see speakerphones
in movies, they would always be on
some big executive's massive desk;
the speaker would be a unit all by
itself.

Here in the newspaper office,
though, the whole thing is built_into
the telephone. And it has changed
the way I live my life.

For as long as I have worked as a

. newpaperman, I have walked around

with a sore neck. This is because of
the way that newspaper people con-
duct telephone interviews. They put
the phone's receiver on their shoul--
der, then they bend their head to the
side so that the phone is cradled be-
tween their shoulder and their ear.

. Then they begin taking notes. Long

interviews can take an hour or more,
and by the time you are finished with
an interview you feel as if you are
ready for traction.

Now, though, all that has changed.
Civilization has come to the tele-
phone interview.

The way it works is that you punch
the speaker button on your telephone
console, and you dial your number.
You can hear the phone ringing on
the other end; you haven't picked up
the receiver, but the sound of the

One question that has arisen time
and again in one-on-one discussions
with curious students and others who
pass by the shanty: "How can peo-
ple sit in a shack in Pittsburgh and
smugly say they know theyare help-
ing the South African people?” This

‘question is usually succeeded by

claims that divestment will really hurt
the very people the policy is designed
to help and that American students
couldn't possibly know whether
South Africans are willing to suffer or
die as a result of divestment.

To a degree, such criticisms are‘

just. After al|,'with the censorship of
all the news going into or coming out
of South Africa,‘-.American students
are quite disconnected from the
horse's mouth.

But Tuesday night, that problem
disappears, as the horse's mouth
comes to Pittsburgh.

why you were so particular with the
butcher back home at Stauffer’s,
Mom. You always wanted only the
best meat for us kids and Dad.

I tossed what remained of the roast
beef into the broiler and focused my
attention on the creamed brussel
sprouts. I tossed two handfuls of the"
sprouts into a pot of boiling water
and then, in another pot, started melt-
ing cheese.

I had just started stirring the cheese
when you called, Mom, to see how
I was doing.

”Great, Mom,” I told you. ”Every-
thing's just fine."

”Just fine."

”How does it sme||?"y

I covered the pan and let the brown- .

tion to the boiling brussel sprouts.

When I come home for Thanksgiv-

was ready to go to pieces myself.

I dumped what remained of the I

sprouts into the sink and checked on
the rice. The wooden’ spoon I used
to stir the rice and sprouts must have
been hexed. The rice would not stir.
I took the pan off the stove, poked at
the dark brown grains and then

or make faces or do anything you
want.

Do you know what it's like? It's like
you have your own radio talk show.
It doesn't feel like you're doing a
newspaper interview anymore. It's
like you're on the air and asking the
questions, and the voice of the per-
son who is answering is being broad-
casted all over America.

That trips you up sometimes, too.
Somehow when you did things the
old way and the phone receiver was
scrunched up between your shoulder.
and your ear, it felt more imperative
that you take notes. You knew that
you were the only person hearing the

answers, and that you had better‘

write them down.

This new way will fool you,
though. Because the answers are
booming through the air, for anyone
in the vicinity to hear, you have to
make yourself take notes. Like a ra-
dio host, you feel as if you have al-
ready done your job as soon as the
other party talks. You almost lose
sight of the fact that you still have a
story to write once the conversation

gee Fund, she can talk about raising
money and goods for refugees and
the many methods American citizens
are using to try to facilitate change in
South, Africa.

But more importantly, as a person
who was born in South, Africa, who
has lived there and has been a wit-
ness to the suffering, wholwas mar-
ried there and who wants to be a
leader in the free South Africa of the
future, she can tell tales of injustice,
oppression and death. She can relate
personal stories of frustration, fear

_ and a number of other feelings as-

sociated with apartheid.

It is these stories that will affect you
for years to come. It is these‘stories
that will lead you to commit to ac-

I didn't even try to clean the pan
off. I threw the whole mess, pan and
rice, away.

Finally, I checked on the meat.
Since it looked brown enough, I re-
moved the pieces from the broiler,
marinated the meat and took it to the
dining room table. I cut into one of
the small pieces and ate it.

Five minutes later I was still chew-
ing on the same raw, fatty chunk of
roast beef. I eventually gave up, spit
out the piece and gave the meat to

Transplants for the elderly

Psychologist criticizes costly life-prolonging measures;

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Elderly
Americans should not be given cost-
ly, life-prolonging medical proce-
dures such as organ transplants
”simp|y so they could live longer,’’

, according to a philosopher who

specializes in health care problems.

Daniel Callahan, director of the
Hastings Center in New York, said on
Thursday that the nation should
adopt a cutoff age, perhaps at 80, be-
yond which costly medical proce-
dures should not be provided.

The money saved by not perform-
ing organ transplants that can cost as
much as $100,000 could be used for
other purposes, such as programs of
prenatal care and the care of new-
born babies and health education for

the general public, he said.

’’I would not deny them care to
relieve suffering,” Callahan said.
”But there is no point living on and
on, to the age of 100, with no regard
for the quality of life.”

Callahan said the United States is
paying six times as much for the
health care of the elderly as for the
young, and that amount will double
or triple in the coming years.

An example of ' an unnecessary
procedure, Callahan said, is a recent
operation in which transplant pioneer
Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University
of Pittsburgh performed a liver trans-
plant on Iola Miller, 76, of Butler, Pa.

Miller said on Thursday that she is

glad she had the operation. ’’I would
like to ask him [Callahan], ’What
would you do if you knew you were
going to be dead tomorrow without
the transplant? Would you have it?’ ”

Callahan said too much money is
being spent on transplant operations
in general and that ”we could be pay-
ing for a lot of research in human be-
havior to get people to stop smoking,
improve their diets and exercise
properly.” T -

Two physicians at Pittsburgh's Al-
legheny General Hospital warned
that Ca|lahan’s plan would be
difficult to implement because it
would be difficult to distinguish be-
tween treatment that would ease

suffering and treatment that would
prolong life.

Dr. James Reilly, an internal medi-
cine specialist, agrees with Callahan
that an organ transplant for a patient
over 80 in many cases is inap-
propnate.

”The one problem I have with Cal-
|ahan’s statement is that it is very
difficult to draw a line between pal-
liative treatment [to ease suffering]
and treament that would prolong
life,’’ he said.

”Age really isn't the issue,” said Dr.
Charles Koliner, a lung diseases
specialist. ”| feel that people of any
age who are going to die and want
to die probably will.”

THE PITTINEWS, Monday, ‘November 9, 1986

John O'Brien, an assistant vice
president at Allegheny General,
asked, ’’If President Reagan develops
another polyp, does this [plan] mean
he would be ineligible for
treatment?”

Callahan holds a doctoral degree
in philosophy from Harvard Univer-
sity and is co—founder of the Hastings
Center, a 17-year-old research and
educational organization established
to examine ethical issues in medicine

' and in biology.

Callahan presented his views at the

research organization established to

Party calls forend to nuclear power

By Jack Burkman

Staff Writer

”In 1982 the Consumer guber-
natorial candidate received 115,000
votes,” said Liz Hughes, a Consumer
Party spokeswoman. ”This time, we
are hoping to surpass this mark.”

Unfortunately for Hughes, her
party did not fare so well this year.
Each of the Consumer Party candi-
dates for governor and senator failed
to get more than 40,000 votes.

In an effort to gain support, the

Consumer Party has made the elimi-
nation of nuclear power the principal
plank in its platform.

”We want nuclear power phased
out,” Hughes said. ”We want to
work safer and less expensive ener-
gy systems.”

Hughes said much of the money
currently being spent on nuclear
power could be used to benefit soci-
ety in other ways.

Nuclear power is not the -sole issue
with which the Consumers are con-
cerned. Hughes says the party is dedi-

cated to the advancement of affirma-
tive action.

”Unlike the other two parties, our
ticket is reflective of our commitment
to equality,” Hughes stated. ”We are
the only party to have a woman run-
ning on a statewide ticket.”

According to Hughes, that the Con-
sumers have a female gubernatorial
candidate proves their commitment
to feminism.

The Consumer Party also objects to
high defense spending. Hughes

claimedthat many of the resources

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Minis-
ter Louis Farrakhan, the controver-
sial leader of the Nation of Islam,
canceled a scheduled speech last
week at the University of Pennsyl-
vania because of differences with
the university over security meas-
ures, a Penn spokesman said.

University spokesman Virgil
Renzulli said the speech was can-
celed when the Ivy League school
refused to allow metal detectors
or body searches at the entrance
of the 2,000-seat auditorium
where Farrakhan was to speak.

In the past, Farrakhan has
traveled with his own security en-
tourage who have frisked au-
diences as they entered an
auditorium. Spokesmen for Farra-
khan have defended the searches,

Farrakhan cancels

which they say have been aimed
at finding weapons.

Farrakhan’s speech Saturday
was to have been part of a four-
day Black Student Unity Confer-
ence. The conference began
Thursday.

Kwame Toure, formerly Stoke-
ly Carmichael, addressed the cori-
ference Friday, and U.S. Rep. Bill
Gray was scheduled to speak
‘Sunday. ’

The university planned to pro-
tect Farrakhan with Philadelphia
police and 57'campus security
guards, Renzulli said. He added
that school security has not resort-
ed to measures such as body
searches even for such high-
profile visitors as former President
Ford and Middle East ambas-

sadors. ,

Neither Conrad Tillard, presi-
dent of the Black Student League
at Penn, nor a Farrakhan spokes-
man could be reached for
comment.

Tillard said Friday there had
been death threats directed
toward Farrakhan and called
Penn's "refusal to allow body
searches an excuse to keep him
off campus.

The Jewish Defense Organiza-
tion had planned to demonstrate
at Farrakhan’s speech.

Farrakhan first achieved nation-
al notoriety in 1984 during Rev.
Jesse Jackson's presidential cam-
paign when he referred to Judaism
as a’ ”dirty religion” and called Hi-
tler a ”wickedly great man.”

Black Week  

Continued from page 1

Also on Tuesday social activist
Naomi Tutu-Seavers, the daughter of
South African Archbishop Desmond
Tutu,‘ will lecture at 8 p.m.

The lecture, according to Caw-
thorn, unlike the week’s other
motivational and achievement-
oriented lectures will be ”purely po-
litical [in subject] and apply to the
divestment issue.” 0

”She tries to come across in an in-
formative way [rather than] pushing
po|itics,” said Beasley.

Beasley believes that this type of
approach, from an insider's view-
point, may be more convincing than
making people listen to just the po-
litical side of the issue.

”She has been in the situation [in
South Africa] and knows what is go-
ing on there,” said Beasley.

Tutu-Seavers, who has been in-
volved in U.S. anti-apartheid work,
and her husband head the Bishop
Tutu Refugee Fund.

The fund has helped meet the
needs of over 50,000 South African

refugees. _

An event called the Black Bazaar
will be held on Wednesday from 11
a.m. to 6 p.m.

The bazaar, as described, by its
chief organizer Eric Mclntosh, is a
showcase of ideas, antiques, crafts,
foods and, quite simply, local black
culture.

"’We’ve invited black en-

trepreneurs from the city to come and.

display their business ideas, their
propaganda, their products, their
jewelry, art and leather-work,” said
Mclntosh.

”People can go in, look around
and buy things. There will be clothes,
jewelry and other things for sale,’’ he
said.

The bazaar recalls the marketplaces
of the world where ideas and cultures
are exchanged along with the ex-
change of goods and money.

At 8 p.m. the nationally renowned
theater company Way Off Broadway
will perform a production of the Fats
Waller musical Ain't Misbehavin’.

The production will feature Mag-
gie Stewart of KDKA’s Evening Maga-
zine, among the local talent
performing.

There will be one show only, and ‘

free tickets will be available between
1 and 6 p.m. on Wednesday. More

' information is available by calling

648-7814. -

On Thursday at 8:30 p.m., well-
known literary critic, linguist and an-
thropologist Ivan Van Sertima will
speak at David Lawrence Au-
ditorium. ,

Sertima is a professor of African
studies at Rutgers University and, ac-

cording to Cawthorn, is the author of '

many of the black studies texts used
at Pitt.

The Minority Jobs Fair will start at
10 a.m. on Friday and will last until
4:30 p.m.

According to Cawthorn, the fair
will be attended by 50 major com-
panies and will be very beneficial to
both them and the students who
attend.

A resume book, with the resumes"

and information from all the attend-
ing companies, has been printed and
will be available for participating
students.

”The Minority Jobs Fair gives the
students a chance to learn more
about the companies and gives the
companies a chance to learn more

about the students,” said”Cawthorn. \

The final event will be a 1 p.m. lec-
ture by Greyhound Corporation vice
president Joe Black.

Black, a former pitcher for the
Brooklyn Dodgers, went on from a
highly successful sporting career to
become the first black vice president
of a national transportation compa-
ny. He _ is expected to speak on
achievement and career success.

Cawthorn believes that this year's
Black Week will be a tremendous
success. ‘

”PubIicizing is the main impor-
tance in a successful event. This year
we have spent more on advertising
than we have in past years,” said
Cawthorn. ‘

”This week, we hope, will ignite
the morale of all students on campus
to increase motivation to achieve our

’ goals and’ interests,” said Beasley.
Beasley hopes the_week will moti- -

vate a sense of involvement and iden-
tity for both the student body as a
whole and for the individual black
student.

”The' week should bring a con-
sciousness of their involvement and
their identity as far as what they can
do as a student body and also per-
sonal ability and how it applies to

'retention, success and individual in-

volvement in issues like divestment,”
she said.
”There is an underlying theme [in

Black Week], and that is to inject-

ideas that the students can carry with
them for the rest of their lives.’’

Committee member to bring

Socialist movement to Pitt

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

Phyllis Cray, a member of the
National Committee of Young So-
cialists, will attempt to bring the
socialist movement here when
she becomes a Pitt student in
January. 

Gray failed to win as a candi-
date in Pennsylvania's 14th dis-

' trict, but she had campaigned

heavily in the Oakland area.

The Workers’ League candidate
said she sees a definite interest in
her party among Pitt students, and
she intends to harness that en-
thusiasm into the formation of a
campus-affiliated organization of
Young Socialists.

She said the Workers’ League
Party is not to be confused with
the Socialists’ Workers’ Party,
which, according to Gray, strayed
from its original platform due to
weak leadership.

{ .

Gray contended that her party
is the only organization of its kind
which fights for the leadership of
the working class.

”So many students are moving
to the left,” said Gray. ”As the sit-
uation develops and the econom-
ic crisis deepens, I see more
students getting involved with us.

”We want to provide an oppor-
tunity for young people to learn
about socialist policies,” con-
tinued Gray. _

Gray said that in 1984, the
Young Socialists were registered
as a campus organization but met
with an ill reception from campus
administration until the group was
suspended.

Gray was not certain why the
group was suspended, but she at-
tributed the lack of organization
of the group to the resignation of
its president.

”This year we've found the

response was greater,” said Gray.
”We try to prepare students for
any attempts by administration to
witch-hu_nt them.”

The administration was not
available for comment.

Gray said her party is against the
militarization of colleges and
universities — referring specifical-
ly to Pitt.

Alden Vedder, the Workers’
League candidate for Congress in
Pennsylvania's 20th district, said
militarization is one reason the
Workers’ League is fighting to
build Young Socialists on all
campuses.

”Wars can't be fought unless
you mobilize the working class,”
said Vedder.

The goal of socialism is to or-
ganize the working class into a
political party that tries to achieve

its goals through the overthrow of“

the ruling class.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 9, 1986

By Jerry Schwartz
AP Writer

NEW YORK -— Radio listeners
on Friday got their first authorized
taste of a long-awaited feast — a
40-song set of Bruce Springsteen's
epic live performances that's born
to run turntables ragged once it
hits the stores on Monday.

Record stores braced for, well,
a record demand for Bruce Spring-
steen & the E ‘Street Band Live
1975-85. Springsteen's populari-
ty soared with his most recent al-
bum, Born in the USA.

’’It ought to be fabulous,” said
Stan Goman, record division man-

' ager of the Tower Records chain,
which has ordered ’’thousands
and thousands and thousands of
copies. Whether we get them is
another story.”

Columbia Records officials said
they had printed 750,000 record
sets and an equal number of tapes
and compact discs. But industry
officials said they would not be
surprised if 5 million units were
swept away in the Christmas and
Springsteen rush.

Each five-record or five-cassette
set is expected to sell for between
$24 and $28, and three-disc sets
will go for about $40.

An eight-song sampler from the
new set, including such Spring-

‘ steen standards as ”Fire,” ”The
River” and ”Tenth Avenue
Freeze-Out,” arrived at radio sta-
tions for airing beginning at 8 a.m.
EST Friday.

The Boss

New live album hits
the airwaves at last

Perhaps the biggest splash was
in Asbury Park, N.J., which
Springsteen immortalized in his
first album, Greetings from Asbury
Park. 

WJLK offered an hour-long
debut party from 7 to 8 a.m., with
taped comments from Sen. Bill
Bradley and Gov. Tom Kean. City
manager Sam Addeo spoke about
what Springsteen has meant to the
town, and listeners called in to
agree. ‘

’’Everybody’s going crazy,” said
program director Pat Gillen.

Disc jockeys elsewhere did not
waste any time. ”When the record
got here, we took the wrapper off,
we took it into the control room,
and we putit on,” said Gary
Winter, program director of
KFMX-FM in Lubbock, Texas,
which offered a Springsteen cut
every hour through the day.

Some did not even wai_t_that
long. When the record arrived
Thursday, a day before the release
date, it went directly on the air on
WLRW in Champagne, lll. — it
was yanked only after an urgent
call from Columbia Records.

”People are so hyped up on this
album,” said program director
Matt McCann. ”We knew we had
it, and we knew our competition
didn’t.” A

Springsteen's intense, four-hour
concerts and his previous refusal
to issue a live album had spawned
a booming industry in bootleg
tapes and records at premium
prices ranging as high as $250. -

Olderworkers replacing
teenagers in fast food jobs

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ More and
more, the smiles behind fast food
counters are being offered by house-
wives and senior citizens as the num-
ber of teen-age_minimum wage job
seekersdeclines, according to indus-
try managers,

‘A shrinking number of teen-agers
and a growing number of minimum

have combined to create a shortage-

of young candidates for some em-

”|’ve seen a shortage in all fast food
chains all across the country,” said
Clara Kinner, national director of
public affairs for Kentucky Fried
Chicken in Louisville, Ky. ”We’re
looking at housewives who would
like to return to work and different
age groups like the elderly.”

Falling birth rates have led to a 20
percent decline in the number of
teen-agers since the 19605, accord-
ing to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

As a result, teen—age unemploy-
ment in the Pittsburgh area fell from

Scott Weber, a Taco Bell manager
in the Pittsburgh suburb of West
View, said he finds older workers
more reliable than harder to find
teen-agers.

Particularly scarce are fast food job
seekers who can work during the
daytime, said Mike Acquaviva, a
spokesman for the state Office of Em-
ployment Security. '

”Housewives and senior citizens
are popular,” he said. ”We have
many employers who say if they can
find a housewife who can work day-
light hours, it would be great.”

Acquaviva said that, with hundreds
of minimum-wage jobs available in
the fast food industry, ”there’s really
no excuse for a teen—ager not to find
a part-time job here.”

But in economically depressed
areas, employers say teen-agers are
more willing to work for minimum
wage or the legal subminimum wage.

”We’ve had no problem in finding
people to work here,” said Lisa Mar-
tin, who manages a McDonald's
restaurant in the economically
depressed community of McKees
Rocks near Pittsburgh. ’’I’m sure it's

THE PITT NEWS.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1986

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

Pitt went into Saturday after-
noon’s game with Miami a heavy
underdog and with the attitude
that they had everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

it didn't turn out that way. The
Panthers did not gain everything.
in fact, they hardly gained any-
thing at all. Except for a bruising,
brilliant game by Craig Heyward
(254 yards), the offense was a
shambles. Sal Genilla, in his first
start, and relief quarterback‘ Joe
Felitsky combined for only 56
yards passing. The quarterbacks
completed three of 14 passes.
They completed more passes to
Miami defensive backs (five inter-
ceptions) than to Pitt receivers.

”We got beat by a good football
team,” Mike Gottfried said of the

loss. ”We made some mistakes. 1

We tried to keep it close and then
beat them at the end of the game,
but it didn't work out that way."

Had it not been for a few key
plays, the Gottfried scenario may
have become reality.

On their opening drive of the
game, Pitt beat the touted Hurri-
cane defense straight down the
field, mostly by giving the ball to
Heyward and letting the huge run-
ning back plow through some Mi-

V ami defenders. At one point in the
drive, Heyward was given the ball
eight out of 10 plays. But on a crit-
ical third and 10 play at the Mia-
mi 18, Genilla never got a handle
on the ball as he tried to hand it
to Heyward, and defensive end
Bill Hawkins recovered. Five
plays later it was 7-0 Hurricanes.

”We were going right down the
field, boom, boom, boom,”
Genilla said of the opening drive.
”And then the fumble happened.
I can't make excuses. The ball was
wet, but it was wet for their ‘quar-
terback, too. it just slipped out of
my hand.”

Vinny-ized
S Testaverde leads ’ Canes

If there was one play that sealed
the game for Miami, it was a
67-yard punt return late in the se-
cond quarter by David Kintigh.

At the time of Kintigh’s return,
the score was 7-3 Miami, and Pitt
had forced the Hurricanes to punt
on their previous two possessions.
Going into the half trailing only
7-3 was exactly what Gottfried
wanted, but Kintigh’s return seem-
ingly put the game out of reach for
the Panthers.

”That was a very big play,”
Gottfried said. ”Yet, they kind of /
dominated the game the second
half, anyway.”

Despite the lopsided score, Pitt
was not as soundly crushed as
they were by, say, Penn State last
year. The defense, particularly the
rushing defense, was outstanding.

Miami gained only 36 yards on
32 rushes. Alonzo Highsmith
finished with just 13 yards, and
Melvin Bratton managed only four
yards. And that was on six carries.
Vinny Testaverde, to be sure, had
a good game but was certainly not
spectacular. The Heisman Trophy
winner-to-be threw for 291 yards
in completing 17 of his 29 throws.
He tossed four touchdown pass-
es and had one pass intercepted.

’’I can't say he's the best quar-
terback I've ever played against,”
said Pitt free safety Teryl Austin.
’’I thought Jim Everrett was better.
I'm not saying he isn't very good,
but I don't think he's the best.”

”We didn't play our best in the
first half mostly because of the
rain,” said Testaverde. ”We never
played in the rain this season, and
it took a little getting used to.”

Testaverde also assured that his
team would not be looking past
Tulsa next week or East Carolina
the Saturday after.

”Every win builds confidence,”
said Testaverde. ”Now everybody
is talking about a bowl game, but
we could get beat and ruin our
dream of being No. 1.”

The locker room was buzzing. The
Miami Hurricanes just won their
ninth straight game, handily stopping
Pitt 37-10, and seemed well on the
way to their second national title in
four years. But these Titans weren't
readily praising their own lofty ac-
complishments. Like shrapnel, the
name of a specific opponent was fly-
ing through the air. Even in victory,
their supposedly invincible outfit was
thrashed by this man —~ relentlessly.
One stunned Hurricane defender
mumbled to himself, ”Geez, like try-
ing to stop a locomotive.”
Craig Heyward was that man.
Not ”lronhead,” but Craig. The
nickhame tends to make this bulldoz-
er seem like a comic book hero, and
nothing was make-believe about
what he did to the Hurricane defense
this past Saturday. He's now known
to the nation's No. 1 team as ”Sir.”
1 His gaudy numbers were 254 rush-
ing yards on 39 attempts, the fourth
best performance by a Panther ever.
”Heyward is just incredible for being
such a big back,” said Miami QB
Vinny Testaverde. ”He’s so strong,
and there's no doubt he's gonna help
Pitt's offense the rest of time he's
here.”
f’He’s really a tough guy to br_ing

down. They threw us off by running
the ball so much, since we prepared
all week for the run-and-shoot/’.
remarked defensive back Jerome
Brown. ”We ran into the Metrorail to-
day. I wonder if we put any dents_in
it?" ‘ '

”He’< tough and fast, a back simi-
lar to [Cincinnati Bengals’] Larry Kin-
nebrew,” said safety Benny Blades,
a victim of a devastating Heyward
stiff—arm. ”You-have to work real hard
to bring him down.” 1

And work hard the Hurricanes did.
Three, four, sometimes five defenders
would be needed to stop the bullish
Heyward once he gained momen-
tum. ’’I really felt comfortable out
there today," said Heyward. ”The
offensive line and Tommy Brown did»
a great job of blocking and deserve
most of the credit. Our gameplan was
to run the ball against Miami, and we
did that effectively." V

True, his blockers did blow enor-
mous holes in the Hurricane line, but

on his own. And that's where he did
the damage. All of this against college

Panther performance not so pitiful after all

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

Yes, Panther survivors, we lost. But
what needs to be realized is that the
final score of the game, a glaring
37-IO, does not really reflect the
game played by our team.

We played the No. 1 team in the
country Saturday, and believe it or
not, on the ground, we gave them a
run for their money.

0 If Mike Gottfried is prescribing
a run-and-shoot offense this year,
Saturday was definitely not its best
example. Instead, it should be
referred to as a run-and-run-some-
more strategy.

Nobody can criticize the tremen-
dous ‘power plays of offensive backs
Craig Heyward and Tom Brown.
Both were astonishing as they liter-
ally bowled over the so-called great
rushing defense the Hurricanes have.
This defense, if looked at from Satur-
day's game, may need to be rela-
beled because it certainly was not
great in any stretch of the imagi-
nation.

”I went in a little scared but deter-
mined to play my best,” said Hey-

‘ ward. ”After a while, though, I just
found the way to get through them.”

Genilla’s collegiate debut a rough one

By Bob Travers

Sta ff Writer

Mike Gottfried waited until the last
possible moment to let the public
know who his quarterback would be
in the wake of the season-ending in-
jury to John Congemi. Gottfried wait-
ed so long, in fact, that it wasn’t until
Sal Genilla, a junior college transfer
from San Mateo, Calif., ran onto the
field for Pitt’s first series that the pub-
lic knew for sure.

The quarterback controversy
swirling around the Pitt team all week
-— the team's second this year - cen-
tered around the fact that if Genilla
played in the game, he would have
only one full year ofeligibility to play
at Pitt. Gottfried had made it a point
to not Lise Genilla in Pitt's first eight
games this season in an effort to give
him a redshirt and thus preserve his
full two years. .

The alternative to Genilla was Joe
Felitsky, a junior who transferred

T from Notre Dame. When Congemi
was temporarily knocked out of
games earlier in the year, it was
Felitsky who relieved him.

The choice facing Gottfried was ul-
timately this: Go with Genilla, regard-
ed as the better player of the two, and
try to salvage something of the 1986
season, or use the questionable
Felitsky against national powers Mi-
ami and Penn State.

Gottfried chose not to sow his oats
for ’87 and '88 and went with Genilla
with the thought of beating Miami
and Penn State.

Unfortunately, Gottfried may have
made the wrong choice. Genilla was
3-12 with three interceptions.
Felitsky, who played part of the
game, was no better. He completed
neither of his two passes — well, not
to Pitt receivers, he didn't. Both
throws were intercepted.

Gottfried, however, stood behind
his quarterbacks. ”I was pleased with
the way Sal played,” Gottfried said.
”It was a very tough situation to be
thrown into.”

For his part, Genilla would make
no excuses and tried to look at the
bright side of his performance. ’’I’m
going to take everything I did today
and build on it," he said after the
game. ”I just have to come out and
correct my mistakes and work from
there. It was a great experience for

Miami defensive back Dan Sileo

Basketball team impressive in scrimmage

By Robert Jordan
Staff Writer

Well, it wasn't exactly the Syracuse
Orangemen, and there wasn't a na-
tionwide audience watching, either,
but the Pitt basketball team engaged
in two scrimmages against West Vir-
ginia State in the field house on Sun-
day. Pitt won both with little difficulty
113-76 and 94-80.

West Virginia State came into Pitts-
burgh with some impressive creden-
tials; they finished last season with a
26-4 record, and they led the nation's
small colleges in scoring. Led by
small college All-America candidate
Ron Moore, WVS is expected to be
one of the top schools in the NAIA
this season.

   

Pitt coach Paul Evans agreed with
the assessment. ”The team itself is not
a bad one, and the competition is
good,” he said.

The Panthers started offwith a
bang, jumping out to an 11-0 lead
barely two minutes into the game,
and never looked back. Captain Cur-
tis Aiken led the charge with 23
points, mostly on long-range jump-
ers. Jerome Lane also had a very good
showing, finishing with 20 points,
many coming on offensive rebounds.

Perhaps the most pleasant surprise
of the day was sophomore point
guard Mike Goodson, who finished
with 19 points and hadtwo 3-point
field goals. Goodson also ran the
offense very well, making every pass
at the right time.

Evans was pleased with the team’s
performance and liked the efforts of
his Dlavers. ”Compared with Thurs-
.day’s scrimmage (at Carlynton High
School], I'm pleased with our perfor-
mance. Today was much better over-
all. Except for a stretch of two to three
minutes where we lost our minds, we

did a much better job today as op- _

posed to Thursday,” Evans said.

”Tico [Cooper] did a very good job
coming off the bench, and Mike
[Goodson] did 100 percent better,”
he continued. ”Curtis [Aiken] had a
strong game as well. The kids are ad-
justing to the system very well. We

had very few bad shots, which was
good. I'm pleased with the
scrimmage.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 9, W86

After the 37-point blowout in game
one, West Virginia State came out in
game two with a vengeance. Led by
Ron Moore's inside game, WVS hung
tough with the Panthers for most of
the first half. Pitt could never get on

‘track, and numerous turnovers kept

Pitt from blowing the game wide
open. '
After a Jerome Lane tip—in slam, the
Panthers seemed to wake up as they
put together an 11-2 spurt to open a
comfortable lead. Freshman Rod
Brookin had a very shaky beginning
in the first scrimmage but settled
down and gave Pitt a much needed
boost off the bench, scoring 8 first-
half points. However, WVS did not
_fo|d under the Panther rush as they
kept plugging aw-ay at Pitt's lead.

WVS pulled within seven at 56-49
with 14 minutes to go. After Charles
Smith went out with a leg cramp,
junior swingman Demetreus Gore
took over offensively and keyed an
8-0 spurt to put the Panthers up by
20 at 77-57. At that time, Evans be-
gan to substitute liberally and to rest
his starters.

The Panthers’ next scrimmage will
be an exhibition game against the
Australian National Team on Nov.
20.

PANTHER NOTES: Brookin left the
game with an eye injury in the mid-
dle of the second half and did not
return. Walk-ons Pat Cavanaugh,
Scott Columbo and John Luther all
saw playing time in both scrimmages.

Notebook

Continued from page 10

0 The Panther defense played a
hard game, but it seemed inadequate
against the Hurricane air plays.
Although there were several beauti-
ful plays by defensive linemen Jerry
Olsavsky, Tony Woods, Steve Apke
and Burt Grossman, Miami star quar-
terback Vinny Testaverde was almost

always able to single out one receiver '

and get his play across.

#0 The classic play of the game
came in the third quarter on a Mia-
mi field goal attempt. It would take
a long time to find such a play in the
history books as ever happening.

Miami was on the Pitt 26 after a
sack of Testaverde by Burt Crossman.
Miami kicker Greg Cox attempted the
field goal and was blocked by Gary
Richard. The ball was recovered by
cornerback Quintin Jones who began
to run it up the field and fumbled. It
was then picked up by Miami center
Gregg Rakoczy and run for a nine
yard return for Miami.

0 At least the fans proved them-
selves by enduring‘ the horrible
weather. The cheering was excep-
tionally better than most games, even

when _we were down by over 20 _

points. Even the band sounded bet-

ter than usual. Saturday’s rendition of’
Hail to Pitt brought back memories ’

of Dimitri Tiomkin’s score for The
Guns of Navarone.

0 Pitt kicker Jeff VanHorne is still
proving himself to be a valuable as-
set to the Panthersquad. His fresh-
man season total is now 10 of 15.

0 Though the quarterback situa-
tion isgoing to remain as it is right
now for the rest of the season, one
of the things that is going to have to
be worked on a lot is the improve-
ment of third down ratios.

Nittany Lions squeak by Maryland

By Maud S. Beelman
AP Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) ~ No

one was more surprised than Pete .

Curkendall when the 260—pound
tackle latched onto a misguided
Maryland pass and Iumbered 82

I yards to help Penn State land a tenu-

ous victory.

’’I didn't expect to catch it. It real-
ly bounced off my ‘chest. I didn't real-
ly realize I had the ball until about
the 50-yard line,’’ Curkendall said‘ af-

- ter Penn State's 17-15 victory

Saturday.

From a bird's eye view, Curkendall
seemed to be running in slow motion
after catching Maryland quarterback
Dan Henning’s tipped pass. A crucial
block by outside linebacker Shane
Conlan cleared the way for Curken-
dall, but he ran out of steam and was
brought down at the 9-yard line.

”The wind got to me, and that's all

I remember,” Curkendall joked, add-
ing that teammates ”had to slow up
to make the block because they were

running by me.”

Curkendall, who made his first start
at tackle Saturday in place of the in-
jured Tim Johnson and had his first
interception, said he took a lot of rib-
bing for his slow return, ”especially
after they announced it was the long-
est return without a touchdown in
history.”

The junior’s interception return
boosted a sagging Nittany Lions
team, who on the next play came
back with a 9-yard touchdown run by
tailback D.J. Dozier to make the
score 14-3. -

Curkenda|.l’s interception, courte-
sy of nose tackle Mike Russo’s pres-
sure on Henning, was one of three
for the 9-0 Lions. Two came as the
4-5 Terps were positioned within two
yards of the end zone.

The defense again clearly dominat-
ed the Lions’ game. Offensively,
Penn State managed only 350 yards
compared with 412 yards for
Maryland.

The Lions also benefitted from two
failed conversion attempts by

Maryland, which would have tied the
score at 17-17 on the last attempt.

”We usually go out there when we
know the big play has to come up,
and we just joke around about who's
going to make the big play this time,”
said outside linebacker Don Graham,
credited for two tackles and one sack.

’’I think that everybody’s got con-
fidence in everybody else, and I think
you have to have that to be a nation-
al championship team," said inside
linebacker Trey Bauer, who had six
tackles and one interception.

The close call will serve a purpose,
Paterno said. ”We were getting car-
ried away with all this business about
how great is this team,” he said of the
No. 2 Lions. ”This’|| get us down to
the nitty gritty. We're a good, solid
football team that's got to play well
to win, and we were fortunate
today.”

Dozier, who rushed for 111,yards,
had two 9-yard touchdown runs for
the Lions. Massimo Manca kicked a
36-yard field goal. ‘

Maryland's scores came on an
18-yard field goal in the third quar-
ter by Dan Plocki, a 16-yard touch-
down pass to split end Vernon Jones
and a 27-yard bomb to wide receiver
John Bonato with 14 seconds left in
the game.

Maryland coach Bobby Ross said
his players ”fought their hearts out.”

Bowl picture cloudy   

By Hal Bock
AP Sports Writer

They have begun to surface
again, slapping backs and laugh-
ing loudly. , College football's
bowl scouts are dropping in on
campuses like autumn leaves,
checking up on the prospects.

The official date for extending
invitations is Nov. 22, but no
bowl worth its corporate sponsor-
ship or television contract waits
that long to line. up pairings. You
wouldn't want to get caught in the
last-minute shopping rush.

There is a unique situation this
year that puts the four major
bowls — Cotton, Orange, Sugar
and Rose — in a peculiar position.

Because of either geography or
other entirely sensible considera-
tions — like old-fashioned, cold,
hard cash — each of the big bowls
is tied to a conference for at least
part of its pairing. That's usually
a good condition for the people
throwing these parties.

Why wouldn't the Orange Bowl
want the Big Eight champion,
guaranteed? The Southwest Con-
ference champion guaranteed to
the Cotton Bowl makes nothing

but good sense. The Southeastern
Conference and the Sugar Bowl is
a natural marriage just as the Rose
Bowl and the champions of the
Pac-10 and Big 10.

The kicker is that this year, the
No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the
country are independents. Miami
and Penn State, tied to no'confer-
ences, are free to roam anywhere
they want for their post—season
games.

‘If those two schools are inclined '

to arrange a national champion-
ship bowl showdown, it will have
to be in..a game outside of the
traditional quartet, one that is un-
encumbered by conference con-
tracts and therefore free to invite
two independents, and one that
can pay big money. The estimat-
ed $2.5 million payoff is made all
the more attractive because in-
dependents don't have to share
the wealth with conference
partners.

The bowl that wins this lottery
also must almost certainly have
corporate backing to finance the
show. That's no problem in to-
day's economically sensitive col-
lege football community, where

businesses with open Checkbooks -

are encouraged to add their im-
primaturs to the bowls.

This auction will likely involve
three bidders. The Fiesta Bowl in

Tempe, Ariz. has Sunkist’s spon- _

sorship and is a place where Penn
State has played and prospered
before. The Gator Bowl in Jack-
sonville, Fla., soon to be fortified
by Mazda's money, offers at least
the home state, if not the home
field advantage to Miami. The
same situation exists for the Flori-
da Citrus Bowl in Orlando, which
used to be the Tangerine Bowl.
What makes a team pick one
bowl over another? Money, of
course, is a major factor, especial-
ly when a bowl is after a hot team
that may have other options.

Lady

_ By Kelley Butt

Staff Writer
When a team becomes accus-
tomed to winning, losses are very

' difficult to handle. The Lady Panthers

volleyball team slipped to 24-11 with
losses to Western Michigan and
Notre Dame.

Pitt was forced to play in front of
the largest crowds they have drawn
this season. Unfortunately, ‘it tended
to take the Lady Panthers out of their
game. Pitt has lost its last three
matches before large crowds. '

' Pitt and WMU did battle in front
of over 2,000 people. The Broncos

easily handled the Lady Panthers in
three quick games (2-15, 12-15,
4-15). :

Pitt coach Shelton Collier com-
mented, "Western Michigan is one
of the strongest teams that we've
played to date. WMU has one of the
finest volleyball programs in the na-
tion.” Collier added, ”We could ap-
preciate the win even though we
were beaten. We're going to use this
as a learning experience.”

Pitt suffered their next loss at the
hands of the Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame. Although the Irish are not a
nationally ranked team, they are well
on their way to establishing them-

selves as a strong nationally recog-
nized team.

Playing in front of a packed gym,
the Lady Panthers once again took it
on the chin — losing three games to
one. Pitt started off with a 15-13 win,
but proceeded to drop the next three
games 10-15, 11-15, 10-15. Lady
Panther Lisa Stewart paced Pitt with
14 kills against the Irish.

”We definitely need to learn to
handle playing in front of a large

crowd better,” stated Collier follow-’

ing the disappointing loss to Notre
Dame. ’’It would be very easy for me
to throw in the towel. However, I be-
lieve in the team,” noted Collier. ’’-I

saw a lot of progress this weekend,
and I believe that we will be able to
win the Big East Championship.”

One of the areas that Pitt will be
focusing on during practice this week
is adjusting to pressure situations. In
the future, they will need to handle
the pressure of performing in front of
a large crowd better than they did
against Notre Dame and WMU. If the
Lady Panthers can take the pressure
in stride, they should continue play-
ing at the level that they are capable
of.

The best thing that the Lady Pan-
thers could do would be to put these
losses behind them. Pitt does not

Panthers lose two games on the road

have the time to waste brooding
about previous losses. Pitt will have
to face some tough teams at the Ohio
State Classic this upcoming weekend.

Pitt is not overlooking the ”Buck-
eye Tournament.” However, they are
concentrating on the upcoming Big
East title match. ”I hope that the loss-
es to Western Michigan and Notre
Dame this weekend will better pre-
pare us for the Big East Tournament,”
said Collier. Beyond the tournament,
the Lady Panthers have pinned a goal
on an NCAA slot.

Pitt, 7-0 in the Big East and com-
fortably in first place, must win the
tournament to get an NCAA bid. 1

This has been her best performance
since she's been here. It is encourag-

David Belowich.

‘ Sandy Albright also broke a Kent
State pool record in the 100-meter
backstroke. She broke the previous
standing record by a two-second mar-
ginewith a time of 1:00.42. The Pitt
team holds eight out of 14 pool
records at Kent State.

Other top finishers included the
200-meter relay team of Albright,

' Amy Williamson, Lorraine Guibord

and Terry Ziegler, with a time of
1:53.66. *

The Pitt women's swim team made
a strong showing in the 1,000-meter
freestyle where Jodi O'Neil, Maureen
Cleary and Cathy Bates took first, sec-
ond and third place, respectively.

In the 200-meter freestyle, Tricia
Rickert took first place with a time of
1:56.04. Teammates Laurie Walczak
and Chris Kaucher weren't far behind
with third- and fifth-place finishes.

In the 100 backstroke, Albright

earned first place. Walzcak had an '

equally impressive first-place finish in
the 50-meter freestyle with a time of
00:24.93.

Pitt again dominated the 100 free-
style with a first-place finish by Tricia
Rickert with a time of 00:54.64. With
another quality finish for Pitt was Al-
bright, with a winning time of
2:14.81 in the 200-meter backstroke.
Mary Cassidy added another first-
place finish for the squad in the
500-meter freestyle.

The Lady Panther divers were on

top of their events with quality finish- '

es on the one- and three-meter
boards. Margie Paulluck executed the
best dives of the day to earn first
place on the one-meter board.

Pitt's men's swim team had a win-
ning day also. They beat the Kent
State squad 73-39. Two of Pitt's team
members also enjoyed triple wins.

Senior co-captain Tom Shal was a
member of the winning medley and
400-meter relay teams. He also
finished first in the 200-meter
freestyle with a time of 3:39.07.

with a time of 00:47.4.

Experienced swimmer Charles
Lersch finished first in the
1,000-meter freestyle with a time of
9251.5. Freshman Charlie Fry had an
impressive first-place showing in the
500-meter freestyle, with a time of
4:42.9. Also earning first-place
honors was Mark Dombrowski, with
a time of 2:13.6 in the 200-meter
breast stroke. Other members of the
first-place 400 relay team were Scott
Jeffries and Tom Shaulinski.

Chris Blair had impressive finish-
es in the diving competition. He
finished first on both the one- and
three-meter boards.

Swimming coach Fred Lewis felt
this road trip was both a beneficial
and a good preparatory meet.

”They showed a lot of progress,
_and the majority posted their best

times for the season. It was extra

difficult for the team because they
had to attend a fullday of school be-
fore traveling to the meet. Halfway
through the meet, I could see that
they were fatigued. Swimming tough
when you're tired is the key to the
championships, though," comment-
ed Lewis. . ~

The women's team will swim
against Syracuse at 3:30 p.m. Friday
at Trees Hall. The men's team will
swim in a dual meet against Syracuse
and Marshall on Friday at 7 p.m. at
Trees Hall. "
