At Student Government Fete

Richard Sobota was inaugurated as President of Student
Government at the Inauguration Banquet in the Faculty

Club last Wednesday.

“Organization and interested personnel are needed if
‘Student Government is to succeed,” said Chuck Isler, out-

going president.

He emphasized tbat in addition
the
president is the representative of
the University Student Body at
both public and private functions
outside the University. '

He also said that in a recent
survey, 80 percent of the faculty
stated that they would be willing
to help SG if asked. Isler urged
Sobota to make full use of this
opportunity. ' '

Dr. John Geise, vice chancellor
in charge of student affairs said
that the coming year would be
the turning point in the develop-
ment of the Student Body?

It is necessary for Student Gov-
ernment to orient,/itself to meet
the major challenge of the tri-
mester, he said. He further
stressed the need for co-operation
in, the working of SG, and that
what is needed most is not some-
thing “ﬂashy and dramatic, but

Details such as a separate com-

lighting and the arrangement of

furniture has not defiinitely been

decided.

The University converted three

Richard Sobota concluded by
saying that this year would be
decisive in the determination of
the long range success of Student
Government.

He stated that. the Student
Body’s aparent ‘apathy is not un-
interest, but unawareness.” He
asked for co-operation and or-
ganization so that the Student
Government will be able to earn
respect and dignity rather than
satire and criticism. ‘

Reed Whittemore Reads
His Poetry With Intent

 

REED VVHITTEMORE

! O * #

ip , , H cu-moor in a poetry vein.

0 * I

S? By PAT CIIERKIN

Another ‘young American poet appeared at the Univer-
sity last week. Reed Whittemore, reading his “humorous
poetry with intent” before the Midday Series audience, pre-
sented a different aspect of modern poetry from the poets
who were here earlier this year. .

.Whittemore, a professor of English at Carleton College,

let the audience know right away:°

that he is not a “beat,” that he
does not approve of any “beat”
poetry, that all “beat” poetry and
poets are purposeless, and that
there is a reason for his poetry.
Whittemore proceeded to read
his “intent” poems, most of which
seemed completely inane. Some
were funny, yes——but-that was
all. He was smug, and too self-
satisfied as he jabbed, in a slight
Midwestern twang, at the “beat”
and the “self-made man.”
Epic l\’Iocks
One pocm, a long mock spic,
did serve a purpose. “The Odys-
sey of Beat,” was a perfect take-
off on “the boys” from Frisco and
their writing. Whittemore’s in-
tonation as he read added much
to the Odyssey which commented
on “the inaudible words of Christ-
like «lack, the sweet ripper, poet,
junkey.” ‘
Whittemore said that these
“self-made aliens speak from
cellars, are angry, desperate and
rebellious.” He then explained
that, “I’m not an alien—I can’t
‘get rid of my bourgeois Ameri-
can background and I don’t
want to. I’m just an average
guy.”
The poet continued. He chided
the man who “could make what

were a “blouse-backed, bat-
winged beige meringue suit,” and.
latgr “emerged as a full page
wfeck for Peck & Peck.”
Reads Sonnet

Next Whittemore verbosely de-
scribed the popular magazine
buyers: “the lovers pause by the

racks their saliva working . . . So-
crates sees all this—tears in his
eyes.”

“Recall” is a poem about the
Air Force where you, “report
and report-—-sing your name -—
sign your name.” He read sev-
al other poems, about rockets.
and Army ﬁeld.manuals, and
Lord Alfred Tennyson, ‘who
“was a ninny with his father's
half guinea and didn’t make
more till he was thirty-four.”
The poet also read a sonnet that
confessed, “I am frightened by
ladders, Freud, ladders,” etc. At
the coffee hour, the smaller audi-
ence heard about “the high school
band—boom, boom.” '
After saying that modern poetry
is going in many directions, and
is not particularly good, Whitte-
more illustrated this philosophy
with a few more of his poems,
which all said something to the
eﬂect of, “I’m sitting here look-
ing out my window, I’m writing

he wantedat will—a table, a for— poetry, I understand life, Rah!
tune,” and his girlfriend who Rah! for me.”

To Lecture

In Scaife Hall

“Pathogenesis of Peptic Ulcer”
will be the topic of the 44th an-
nual Mellon Lecture to be held
tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in Scaife
Hall Auditorium.

The speaker will be Dr. Lester
R. Dragstedt, research professor
of surgery at the University of
Florida.

For the last 40 years, Dr. Drag-
stedt has been studying surgical
procedures concerning the diges-
tive system of the body. In 1953

he introduced the concept that,

peptic ulcers were usually due to
an increased secretion of gastric
juice.

A native of Montana, Dr. Drag-
stedt recevied his Ph.D. at the
University of Chicago and his
medical education at Rush Medi-
cal College and the Universities
of Vienna and Budapest.

Except for a two year period
during which he was a North-
western University faculty mem-
ber, Dr. Dragstedt was a member
of the faculty of the University
of Chicago. He retired from the
University of Chicago in 1959 after
a period of 19 years of service.

The lectureship is sponsored by
the Society for Biological Re-
search at the University’s School
of Medicine through the Sarah

Engineer Draws
N ebbish Cartoons

Between ' Classes

Cartooning and chemistry, seem-
ingly two unrelated activities, are
Bill Niederst’s main hobbies. Bill,
who has been drawing cartoons
since he was in high school at
North Catholic, is now a sopho-
more in chemical engineering.

Commuting from his home in
Mount Troy, doing engineering
homework and pledging Phi Delta
Theta doesn’t leave Bill much
timerfor cartooning, but he has
managed to scribble off 70 or 80

of them in the Tuck Shop between
classes.

He says that he gets all of
his ideas from listening to Tuck
Shop patrons. “pouring out their
woes.” For this reason most of
his cartoons are penned on lec-
ture notes and the‘ backs of text
books. '

In addition to cartooning, Bill
likes to experiment in his home
chemistry lab, do watercolors and
charcoals, ﬁsh, and work on his
car. Since he does not go to
school during‘ the third trimester,
he works for a roofer in the sum-
mer months.

Three‘years of art in high school
and two years at" Carnegie Mu-
seum Art Institute qualify Bill for
a career in art, but after gradua-
tion he plans to work for a chem-
ical engineering company in Cali-
fornia.

Pa tential   Force .

Elmer Merkovsky, a few Scottish Highlanders from
Carnegie Tech and -a last minute debate resulted in a para-
doxical student government election that not ‘only gener-

 

. ated interest, but in addition humor. V

-.

Despite the means used to attain interest, the fact that
interest in the legislative bodies still prevails seems to jus-
tify the usage of unusual instruments.

The students who have continued to maintain this in-
terest are chiefly the freshmen and sophomores as exem-
pliﬁed by the number of them running for Men’s Council
position. The group of students seeking oﬁices consists of
five freshmen, three sophomores and one senior.

During the past few years, Men’s Council—which at
one time was a legislative body—.has slowly decayed into a
Christmas Ball committee. Unlike its legislative counter-
part, Associated Women’s Students, it has failed to main-
tain any type of legislative position on campus.

Several of the freshmen and sophomores, who are
running foriexecutive positions in Men’s Council, have
formulated a plan by which this ‘ailing body. can be re-
habilitated. _

They don’t want to usurp SG, but rather plan to co-
ordinate activities with them; they plan to serve the stu-
dent body by investigating problem situations rather than
assign this task to some nebulous committee as SG often
did last year. I

Possibly the best thing that these students have already
done isto ask approximately 50 students to become asso-
ciated members of lVlen’s Council-——their duty would be to
attend every meeting and to participate in the discussion
in order to get a more accurate picture of the existing prob-
lem situation.

Any reports that this group would formulate would be
sent to SG where further action could be taken, and also
sent to The Pitt News to be published for the beneﬁt of
-the student body. '

Although many upperclassmen may observe this enthu-
siasm and desire to cooperate with SG with skepticism, they

shouldn’t, since this is exactly where they have failed..

This failure has been the pitfall of SG.

For example, AWS rarely consults or informs either
students or SG about what they do or aren’t permitted to
do at their meetings, and their legislative counterpart,

Housing Board, whose superﬁcial laws flood the. campus .

spasrnodically, can also be classiﬁed in-the same category
of an indifferent body. '

Yet, according to the SG constitution, both Men’s
Council and AWS are subordinate to SG——in the past SG
did nothing to indicate the truth of this statement.

Both Pan Hel and Interfraternity Council also ﬁt into
this category. Each has tried to achieve certain student pol-
icies, but has failed. The sororities do not achieve the de-
sired ends because they vainly attempt to. gain adminis-
trative support alone instead of throwing the weight of
their organization with SG in gaining the “desired ends.

IFC, although it did gain the support of SG when it_

was trying to get “a wet campus,” never bothered to use
SG as a tool after their defeat. ,

In other words, what we are trying to explain, is that
student bodies should follow the example of these enthu-
siastic freshmen and sophomores who seemed to have found
the only plausible means of establishing a strong student
body-—cooperation.

What can be gained by cooperation? We will have a
strong student body——a student body that will not have to
submit itself to those familiar “psychological approaches of
persuasions” that administrators employ all the time in
order to convince students of their minuteness. \

We congratulate these, young leaders for attempting
to maintain interest and conﬁdence in SG, and hope that
the student body will give them the opportunity to achieve
this plan. Maybe if this is one, others will realize the value
of cooperation.

A New Frontier‘. . . ,

Women's Regulations

_ , By lnh Amdur

A veryliwise old man once told his followers
that they should seek out their own salvations with
diligence. There is much truth in this statement of
the Buddha’s which could be fruitfully applied by
some of the administrators in their dealings-with
students. Particularly the strictness of the rules for
resident women could be tempered by the consid-
eration of this maxim.

If indeed one subscribes to the belief that
everyone must seek out his own
salvation with diligence, the ad-
herence to this opinion inﬂuences
one’s attitude about the value of
legislating behavior. For if one
also accepts the doctrine that
collegeiis a place where one most
likelybegins to work out his own
view of life, then it is evident
that the more responsibility
which the administrators take
upon themselves, the less chance
does the student have to arrive
at his own rules of conduct.

In particular one might object to the fact that

undergraduate women are not permitted to have
their own apartments. Another facet of the hous-
ing restrictions which could be proﬁtably investi-
gated is the curfews.
Responsibility of Freedom _ .
First let us deal with the apartments. College
is an institution where one learns to cope with re-
sponsibility in a meaningful way. One way of

learning how to cope with responsibility is through-

the necessity of deciding what to do with one’s
freedom. As we know the two are inseparable. If
an undergraduate student has the permission of
herparents to live in an apartment off campus,‘ it
seems that there is no valid reason why she should
not be allowed to do so.

Certainly it necessitates maturity” to live in an
apartment when one is going to school. All rules
are self—imposed. However there is no better way
of gaining maturity than by learning through trial
and error, if necessary, how to appreciate and bene-
ﬁt from freedom. It requires much more maturity
to impose one’s own curfew upon oneself than it
does to blindly obey the rules made by another
person for the abstract “woman student.”

There are many reasons why one might prefer
an apartment to a dormitory room. Perhaps one
likes more quiet than there is in a dormitory; per-
haps one wishes ‘to choose a roommate. In any

case, assuming that an undergraduate student has_

 

parental permission, no reason for her desire to live
in an apartment should be necessary. College
women should have the respect and conﬁdence of
those who minister to them. It is very possible that
if-more trust were demonstrated, there would be
much better and more fruitful relationships be-
tween the students and the administration. Arbi-

» trary rules always incite a perverse desire to be

disobedient. Trust on the other hand, might pro-
duce the determination that one will not misuse
the privileges that one has been given.

If women students were given freer curfews
and were allowed to have apartments undoubtedly
they would misuse some of their privileges. But the
assumption that we are making is that each stu-
dent must seek out her own salvation. She will
make mistakes, and if they prove harmful, she will
correct them. This is the only way in which any
maturity can be gained.

For Less Curfews

There are many women’s colleges not located
in cities in which the students have no curfews at
all and are allowed to live anyplace they desire.
We realize that this much freedom might not be
feasible at the university since it is located in a
city. Also the administration needs the approval of
the parents of resident students to implement new

‘curfews. However, it would be a good idea to send

out questionnaires to parents in order to ascertain
their opinions on the subjects of curfews and apart-
ments. As we have said the rule on apartments
could be immediately lifted if some of the parents
approved. Then the only condition which a resident
student would have to fulﬁll in order to gain per-
mission to live in an apartment would be demon-
strating the approval of her parents.

If some parents approved of more lenient cur-
fews adormitory with very lax restrictions could
be established for those honor students whose par-
ents did approve. If these students demonstrated
the ability to handle their responsibilities perhaps
privileges could be extended to the rest of the
women students. A

The products of this new kind of college envi-
ronment would be far better suited to face moral
situations where the only rules which one has are
those which are self-imposed, than the prodiicts
of the present sheltered college environment. If
women students are not given the conﬁdence and
the freedom which will enable them to seek out
their own salvations with diligence, one can be
assured that when they graduate from college,

‘they will not know how to make an intelligent use

of freedom.

Aspirants Speak
Editor, The Pitt News

As a result of student action‘

two weeks ago to improve the

status of Student Government,.

we have decided to work for this

same improvement in the opera-

tion of Men’s Council. To im-

prove its operation, we would do
’ the following:

1). Increase participation. of
the Council in Orientation Week.

2'). Determine what changes
Men’s Council can make in the
existing Men’s Conference pro-
gram. ”

‘3). Decide, by interviewing
head residents and floor coun-
selors, what action would con-
tribute to better dormitory life.

4). Publicize and“ hold open
meetings in which anyone may
express his opinions.

5). Exchange representatives
with the Senate, AWS, IFC, and
the dormitory councils to co-or-
dinate activities.

6). Send periodic newsletters
to these groups informing them
of the Council’s activities.

7). Report to The Pitt News
regarding the Council’s ﬁndings
and its actions.

By doing these things, we feel
that we can make a definite con-
tribution to the operation of Stu-
dent Government. Through co-
ordination we can prevent dup-
lication of effort} and through
co-operation wecan get things

Bennett Asked To
Mind His Business

Editor, The Pitt News:

Re: “An Editor’s Folly” by Mr.
William Bennett, of the March 1,
1961 issue of The Pitt News.

Mr. Bennett has made a noble
attempt _to gain support for his
high-classed but low-circulated.
publication “Ideas and Figures.”
Not ~ only should his advertise-
ments be kept off of your admir-
able editorial page (he should
have been directed to pay for an
ad, like anyone else), but sim-
Bennett be
kept off the editorial page.

First he has the unmitigated
gall to compare himself to the

"masterful Mailer,’ saying that he

(Bennett) should also be allow-
ed to make an “Advertisement
for Myself.” Anyone who reads
past the title of the book (which
is obviously a practice quite
foreign to Bennett) Vwould be
able to discern the clear bifurca-
tion: Mailer makes an “adver-
tisement” as does a Wilde. Ben-
nett - makes an “advertisement”
as does a child.

Forcing myself. to continue
reading his garbled, disgression-
ridden message (he obviously
has not been paying his syn tax),
I found one other statement
which approaches the coherent:
he laments that all that his pro-
ﬁts of the 'past_consist of is 17
cents and the lower jaw «of a
sparrow skull. Needless to say,

the sparrow, after flying past _

the “Ideas and Figures” office,
probably keeled over from the
stench of the putrid pages of his
publications, which arestacked,
unsold, in the corner.

In conclusion, I want it clear

- that I havenothing against the

-idea of such a_ magazine. ,How-
ever, I am concerned with what

' is holding the reins. Having never

seen Bennett’s by—line on any-
thing else in The Pitt News, I
deduct that he is not actually
contributing any real work for
the paper. Rather, I picture him
sitting in his own office, smoking
and choking on his pipe, bare
feet on his “beatnik-prose” lit-
tered desk, trying desperately,
with all his might, to grow a
beard. Occasionally, when he
thinks his popularity needs a
boost, he will -carry a collection
of words into The Pitt News.
In short, I think Bennett
should stay out of the pages of
our public paper and return to
his own duty. Perhaps if he con-
centrated on some solid ”Ideas,”

-his trasury would show better

“Figures.” “ .

Caspari Offers Solution A
To Heredity Problems

By JULES ZACHER
Professor Ernest Caspari attempted to unravel the prob-
lems of heredity and variation of genetic control and action
in his lecture, “The Conceptual Basis of Biological Sciences.”
“What are we trying to do when we work on biological
problems?” was the first question thrown out by the eminent
biologist. Dr. Caspari used two points to answer this ques-
tion. The first point was that the¢

Raeran Speaks
On Psychology

Dr. Gregory Raeran, as part of
the University’s “Psychological
Colloquium” series, will- discuss
“Russian Experiments in Inter-
ceptive Semantic Conditioning”
on Friday at 3:30 p.m. in the
Faculty Club Dining Room.

The Russian born lecturer, who

is chairman of the psychology de-
partment at Queens College,

scientist is trying to get informa-
tion about the world around us.
Dr. Caspari followed this part

of the answer with a statement »

that the scientist is also using this
information by ordering it and
applying it to further problems.

Deﬁnite Connection

He continued by noting that the
ordering of this information pre-
supposes that there is a deﬁnite
connection in nature. The connec-
tion and grand order in nature is
hard to perceive, he explained
but the scientist must have a faith
that this connection does exist 6r
he should not be in the ﬁeld of
natural science.

The next question put forth
by the biologist was, “VVhat
distinguishes biology from the
inorganic science?”

Caspari’s first answer was that
biology is more concerned with
comparison than the inorganic
sciences. However, though this
may be true, these two parts of
science do not really differ be-
cause they both lead to casual
connections.

Know Purpose

The well known biologist ﬁnal-
ly came to the conclusion that
the main difference between bi-
ology and the inorganic sciences
is that biology deals much more
with the purpose of things than
the inorganic sciences do.

It is the interest of the biolo-
gist, no matter if he is dealing
with a simple organ, to ﬁnd out
about the function or purpose
of an organism. The question
of what is the function of this
organ is necessary for the com-
plete description of this organ.

Dr. Caspari saidpthat not only
is it necessary ’ to know what
makes up an organism, but the
biologist must also know what
is the purpose of this organ if a
full description is required.

Turns Critical ‘

At the end of his lecture, Dr.
Caspari turned a critical eye on
the current schools‘ of genetics.
The vitalistic school, said Dr.

has two basic assump-

tions.
The ﬁrst
been

is that there has
regulation of evolution
and the other is that identical
reproduction has taken place.
According to Dr. Caspari, these
two statements are misleading
becausﬁ they beg the question
by making a statement and not
going any further. 0

The next school of genetics to
receive Dr. Caspari’s critical re-
marks was the Wholist school.
The theory of this part of genet-
ics is that the whole is'more than ~
the part, or the properties of the
whole cannot be interpreted from
I106 l0a1‘ts. Dr. Caspari said that
this statement is trivial.

His own theory on genetics is
that he tries to describe the life
processes by using the chemical
and physical approaches. His ba-
sis for evolution are the ability
of self—reproduction and the abil-
ity of dying.’

To Victory

Blue & Gold Win 49
Eastern Titles Under
Successful Coach

In 1949 Athletic Director
Tom Hamilton decided to re-
activate wrestling at this
school after an absence of 15
years. He went all the way
to Oklahoma to grab a well
known high school coach, Rex
Peery.

During Hamilton’s brilliant ca-
reer as Athletic Director this was
no doubt his smartest move. Un-
der the guidance of Peery, the
Panther mat squads have grown
from the hapless doormat of East-

ern wrestling to the reigning
power of that group.
Peery, a three time NCAA

champion, has posted a 93-31-2
record since coming to Skyscrap-
er U. 17 of these losses came in
the first two years before Peery
had a chance to develop the ma-
terial.

Besides his coaching ability
Peery brought two sons to the
University. Hugh and Ed dupli-
cated their father’s feat by win-
ning three. national champion-
ships apiece.

In the seven years the Blue and
Gold have entered the Eastern
championships they have brough
home four titles. . ‘
_ At the National championships
the Cats have placed second twice
and havevcome in third the same
number of times.

It is no wonder that Hamilton
said, “Peery is the best coach I
have ever seen in any sport.”

Cats Finish 6-3;
Haas Set Record

By DAVE JOHNSON

its far as the Panther mer-
men are concerned, there is
no such thing as an anticli-
max. Throughout the current

season they have continually wait
ed until the ﬁnal 400-yd. free-
style relay event to smash their
opponents.

The ﬁnal dual meet of the sea-
son last Saturday night against
Notre Dame was no exception to

the rule. With two events remain-

ing, the Panthers held on to a slim
thirteen-point lead. Dave Witchger
and Joe Bnacco, Irish breast
stroking stalwarts, cut the margin
to six points placing first and sec-
ond in the 200-yd. breast stroke
event.

With the ﬁnal event remain-
ing, the hopes for a Panther
victory rested with the 400-yd.
free style relay contingent. Sars-
ﬁeld, Warnes and Rush com-
bined their eﬁorts to give Bart
- Haas a two—stroke advantage for
the ﬁnal leg of the race. Haas
touched the wall two strokes
ahead of Bill Cronin to capture
victory for the Panthers.

By ED HOWARD

On April 21, 1953, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh was
looking for a basketball coach
for the ﬁrst time in 31 years-
Dr. Henry Clifford Carlson
was retiring at the age of 58
to devote more time to his duties
as a director of the University’s
Health Service, a position he still
holds.

The era of innovationwas over.
Down through the years, Doc
Carlson had come up with some
of the most novel ideas in the
game-—-ice cream for athletes,
fatigue measurements, oxygen_on
the bench for tired players and
others too numerous to possibly
include. ,

The grand old man himself
overlooks all these things. “My
only contribution to basketball,”
claims Carlson, “was the concept
of continuity.” That was his

of play known today as the ﬁg-
ure-8. One sportswriter described
the Carlson version as “a couple
of streamlined merry-go-rounds,

a coach and as a person. He was
named in 1950 to coach the East
in the annual East-West charity
game in New York. The previous
year he was selected for the Helms
Basketball Hall of Fame.

Why did he quit? His son, Dr. -

Cliff Carlson, had advised his
father to give up his coaching
chores because of the demands
it placed on his energy. But
Carlson himself cites another
factor as the cause of his deci-
sion.

Asa Bushnell, head of the East-
ern College Athletic Conference
of which the University was a
part, had turned thumbs down on
spring practice‘ for basketball,
Carlson was furious. “How- can
you coach if you_don’t haveitime
to develop your players?” he qiies—
tioned. '

to go through an entire basketball
season undefeated. That earned
Coach Carlson the nickname “Win
’em All.”

Under his guidance, the Pan-
thers were the ﬁrst college has-
ketball team to travel the length
and breadth of the nation, stop-
ping in a total 1 of 38 states.
“None of my boys ever ﬂunked
geography,” Carlson grins to-
day.

In fact, most of his boys never
ﬂunked anything. On his last

team, seven of the ten had QPA’s .

of 2.7 or better on a three-point
system. .

Of this group, four became doc-
tors, one is a dentist, another an
engineer and only one became a
coach. Over the years, he turned
out 35 boys who are ‘now earning
more than $25,000 a year. “If a

boy could stand four years with

Carlson,” says the Doc, “he could
stand anything.” ,

So Doc Carlson, who still ranks
sixteenth in total games won as a
coach, is most proud of the accom-
plishments of his players after
they left the court. .

the record for that event with a combined time of 3:59.9.

Among the teams the mermen defeated this year were Bucknell,
Middle Atlantic Conference Champion; NYU, Metropolitan New York
Association Champion; the Virginia
Military Institute, Southern Conference Champion; and Syracuse,
It ‘Upper New York State Conference Champion.

; The Panthers swam a rough schedule this year andhave received
little recognition for their accomplishments. Hats off to Coach Grady
. and his swim crew for a job worthy of comment.

Trimester System May Hinder
Early Part of Diamond Season

"Coach Bobby Lewis may find
the early going rough in the up-
«timing baseball season as his
roster promises to be quite thin
for the ﬁrst ﬁve games. The roster
lists 34 prospects, of which 19 are

. sophomores.

These latter players are listed
in the brochure as second year
men, but in reality they are not at
this date. They are only freshmen
and won’t attain the higher status

V until the current trimester ends
on April 17.

I » The NCAA ‘rules forbid the use
Of yearlings in collegiate varsity
§;_>_orts, so the ﬁrst year men vs7”1ll
have to sit out a few weeks of
action.

Because the University oper-
ates on the trimester plan, base-
ball candidates must attend

school for the ﬁrst three trimes-
ters in order to be eligible. For-
merly the athletic department
sponsored a frosh nine, but since
the new calendar has been in
affect, it was erased. .

So Lewis will have to manip-
ulate 'a token squad of a little
more than a dozen men in initial
action. But the trimester won’t
always plague his diamond season
he feels. -

“I’m looking forward to the day
when some more schools adopt
the system. Penn State, Penn and
a few others are supposed to.
Then we can play about ﬁfty or
sixty games a year. We miss play-
ing in July and August. But we
have ‘no competition at that time
because .,no one else is in school.”

Gridder Gains Boxing Fame

_ By JIM O’BRIEN
Young Jim Stout stepped

into the ring under the g1ar- . 

ing, harsh lights of the Me-
morial Field House and out
of oblivion in the campus
athletic scene. It was Feb. 21,’

the ﬁnal night of the 16th an-
nual Post-Gazette Dapper Dan
Golden Gloves amateur boxing
tournament, and Jim was after
the ‘senior novice heavyweight
Cl‘O\Vl'1.

The 18-year-older was an ath-
lete at the University, but not be-
cause of his prowess in the ring.
He was an unheralded member of
the star—studded yearling football
team which compiled an unbeaten
mark. He hadn’t done enough
damage with his. gridiron togs, so
he picked up the leather gloves.

A college pre-med student en-
gaging in pugilism in the “square
jungle.” Why? “It’s a lot of fun.”
If Stout’s story sounds paradoxi-
cal, it’s no wonder. He also hails
from State College, Pennsylvania,
the hamlet of rival Penn State,
His father,’ Professor Randall S.
Stout, teaches economics at the
University Park School. ‘

‘ Sandy Hair

A lock of sandy hair fell limp-
ly over Jim’s pale eyebrows and
freckled forehead. His eyes were
a washed denim blue; they glit-
tered as in fever, watching his
opponent with alarm.

His taller adversary stood di-
rectly across the white canvas.
He was the biggest man in the
amazon of large proportions. He
was a gross mass of fat. It roll-
ed him in lumpy hillocks.

The bell broke the silence, and
both ﬁghters moved from their
corners. ‘Stout pummeled his foe
furiously, but it didn’t seem to
have much effect. Then the young

hard blows himself. Finally, thel
buxom human heifer tired, and
Jimblasted away; the stomach of
his enemy shaking upon him in
huge pillows.
Splattered Blood
Jim’s chest was splattered with

cut above his eye, and the referee
called a halt to the destructive
melee. Jim was champ. It wasn’t
his ﬁrst laurels, even though he
had only six ﬁghts. A few weeks
earl-ier he was named the “out-
standing novice” at a similar affair
in Steubenville, Ohlo.

Surrounded by some admir-

ers, the youngster was ushered

downstairs to the dressing
room. His manager Al Quail
was tearing his bandages off,
and inquiring as to his condi-
tion. Stout spoke quietly, never
boldly, he was still a gentle-
man. _
Some. varsity gridders entered
the room and approached the new
hero. They offered their hands in

congratulations, and Jim smiled

meekly back. The grinning face
of John Michelosen, head foot-

ball mentor, appeared in the
throng.
“Congratulations, boy. You

A looked real good out there,” John-

ny Mike commented. “Thanks,
coach,” the student replied. Then
Quaill interrupted, “You’ll have
a better football player now,
John. He’ll be tougher.” Michelo-
sen remarked, “Yeh, it’s a shame
he can’t use those gloves.”

Jim Sto-it is back in the class-
room again. and tending to his
studies, but he may still dwell
on his career in the ring—an un-
defeated heavyweight champ.
That’s keeping good company with
Rocky’ Marciano.
