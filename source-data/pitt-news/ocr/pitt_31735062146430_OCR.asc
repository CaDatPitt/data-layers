T‘-Pitt outclassed the Great Lakes
Naval Training Station football team
I in a. scrimmage staged the afternoon
before the -game was scheduled to
have taken place. It was pulled off
quietly and few .knew about it till
someofthe sport scribes got hold of
“the rumor and ran it down. The sched-
uled game was prevented from being
played because ofithe ban on public
' gatherings due to _the Spanish inﬂu-
enza epidemic. Here is the story. Of
the game as told by one of the ath-
letic authorities: » A _’ 
“It all happened sort of accidental-
ly. The Great Lakes team arrived in
Pittsburgh Friday morning and simul-
taneously the ban on public gather-
. ings went into effect.-. There was noth-;
-ing for Pitt to debut call off the
game and send the sailors back home-
. “This made some of. the sailors lath‘.
. er cocky, although, in‘ the main, they
‘were as ﬁne a bunch 0f fen°W5 as
ever "came to Pittsburgh t0 ‘P185! 3
game. However, they were bllbbling
over with conﬁdence in .the.ir.abi1ityp
to beat thefamed-Warner eleven and

‘didn't make any secret of theirabelief -

in themselves. Some of them Said it
‘was lucky for Pitt the-‘ﬂu’ epidemic
was on. ‘B0’ Olcott. the Great Lakes
coach, probably "was more oonﬁdellt
even than his players;-; and lndmated
it as his desire that.his team ‘get at
least a chance to scrimmage with the
Panthers. .. _

“Pop Vvarner ._learned of this and
readily agreed -to pithis men aga-11151
0lcott's, but, to prevent any hard feel‘
ings, it was agreed that n.either team
should score on the other if the OD‘

‘portunity should arise.‘ To l>I'9V9T1t
any scoring it was decided that the
ball should clia~nge..han_ds.‘anY Um‘?
either team carried it to its opponents
20-yard line.‘

“Well, sir, they went to it.-‘and. W. .

me. tell you somethinsh ‘That Great.
Lakes team is an all-star one, all
right, but it isn't in it with Warner-s
smooth-working machine. Had they
played theirﬂregular game as sched-
uled, Pitt would have won by about
30 to 0. As it was, _Pitt showed Just
what it could have done had the game
been played. It put it allover the
Great Lakes team. It worked the ball‘
. down.1;o the 20-yard line often enough

Easterday and Gougler at halves, and

scrimmage was over practically all
‘ the squad had faced _the Great Lakes
. team and still the ‘Panthers continued
to carry the ball down the ﬁeld. _
C The Pittites gained almost at W111
-and took the, ball down to the 20-Yard
. line time and again. The Great Lakes
“ team could do nothing on the often-
sive and made only two ﬁrst downs,
-both on ‘forward passes. Individual-
