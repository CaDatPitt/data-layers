UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Many Calls In Recent Weel.'s

False Alarms Waste
Money, Injure Women

Captain Charles Ray of the University Police conﬁrmed
reports last week that “the number of false ﬁre alarms turn-
ed in from the University has been unusually high in recent

weeks.”

Ray added that while false alarms are a rather common
occurrance, the two most recent calls came very close to-

Pa. C-overnor’s
Ruling Drops 1,

Textbook Tax

David L. Lawrence, governor of
announced
week that he has taken the sug-
gestion of numerous educators
and students to exempt textbooks
from the four percent state sales
tax.

The new ruling—made by the
State Revenue department and
approved by the Attorney Gen-
office, exempts . all text-
books sold directly by schools to
students and faculty members for
use in prescribed courses. Books
bought from commercial shops‘
however, will still be taxable.

The University students were
not however, the only one seek-
ing such a relief. The question
of abolishing state tax on text-
books has been posed to the
governor nearly every time he
met with students from Penn-
sylvania schools and colleges.

Several other schools and col-

leges had also sent in petitions

asking for such on exemption.

Other educational material such
as slide-rules, notebooks have not
as yet been exempted from the
state tax as yet.

Ogether.

One of the calls was turned in
from the fourth ﬂoor of Scaiffe
Hall. Immediately after the alarm
was sounded, a building superin-
tendent reportedly chased two
young teen-agers but, “because
they had rubber-soled shoes, they

got away.”

Schenley Too '

The other recent false alarm
was sent from Schenley Quad-
rangle last week, causing several
pieces of ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment
to converge near the Quadrangle.

On one of the recent false
alarms, Ray added, a young
woman was struck by an auto-
mobile which was attempting to
move out of the path of the
racing ﬁre-trucks. The uniden-
tiﬁed girl was taken to a hospital
by police ambulance, but appar-
ently was released shortly after-

Wards.

Trafﬁc injuries ‘seem to be the
chief danger of false alarms. The
chief of Fire Battalion Two, Oak-
land, Ralph Meyers, agreed that
“people often get hurt when trucks
have to roll.” He added that he
himself had received forty stitches
in thehead last year in front of
the Pennsylvania Athletic Asso-
ciation Building when a hook-and-
ladder turned a corner too sharply
while hurrying to a false alarm.

The battalion chief reported that
out of the 182 alarms his Oakland
headquarters has received this
year, 81 have been false. “Pitt,”

‘By JOSEPH GREIF
Directly across from the Pitt
Field House stands the new Physi-
cal Education Building. It is still

under construction. When com-
pleted, it will house both the new
pool and a new gymnasium.

\ The long-awaited pool is 165
feet long and 75 feet wide. Frank
Carver, athletic director at the
University, speculated that it is
probably the largest indoor pool
in the country. Most other college
pools measure about 75 feet long
and 50 feet wide.

The new pool is divided into
four sections, one of which will
almost always be open to students
and faculty who want to get wet.

Instruct Beginners

There will be enough room to
instruct 150 beginners at a time.
Even canoeing will be able to be
taught with all four sections open.
With an underwater public address
and lighting system, water ballet
will prosper.

The pool will feature diving
boards at 30 feet and three feet
high. Under the boards, the
water will be 16 feet deep.
Otherwise the depth will start
from 35,4, feet and increase to
nine feet. The massive pool

high schools, to Broadway, to the

movies.

The story concerns the comrade
of a couple of young men who

to help them win their sweethearts.
It will be done in period costume,
including hoop skirts and high
collars, and in the style of the
1890’s. -
Three Sides
The audience will be seated on
three sides of the acting area, and
the scenery will necessarily be
kept moderatelysimple because of
the limitations of room and the
lack of a curtain. The main change
will be accomplished by means of
a revolving platform with a back-
drop ‘on each side. «It will be
moved in full view of the audi-
ence by a stage crew also decked
out in period. costumes. Another
featured piece of scenery will be a
moderate sized fountain which
spurts water. .

cording to Ned Bowman, tech-
nical director, is to. present

in Stephen Foster Memorial,
“Becket" in the Cathedral, and
the players have done shows in
cooperation with the Antiqua
Players in Heinz Chapel.)

for “Charley’s Aunt” as was used
for “Becket,” but with a lighting

All freshmen will live on cam-
pus for three days during one of
the six orientation sessions. From
150 to 200 students will attend
each session. The first will be
held June 17 to June 20; the re-
mainder will be spaced throughout
the summer.

he added, “always has its regular
share of them, too.” Most false
alarms, however, are the result of
school-childrens’ pranks.
Field House Alarms

“We seem to get false callsfrom
the Field House pretty regularly,”
Meyers commented, adding that
they usually were turned in around
dinner time, or when the high
schools_let out. “It just means
more danger to pedestrians and
more expense to the city.”

He then added that oﬂieia-ls
have estimavtedthat moving out
ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment on false
alarms costs approximately ﬁfty
dollars for each truck, although
the estimate seemed a bit high

to him.

Plant Slated For 1964

holds 770 thousand gallons of
water.

Safety precautions are varied
and detailed. Carver commented
that maintainance of the proper
conditions will be a tremendous
job. There will be three life-
guards on duty whenever the area
is being used for student recrea-
tion. ’

The pool is now ﬁlled. During
the next few months, it will be
drained and reﬁlled several times
to check for any ﬂaws in con-
struction. It is expected ‘to be
ready for use by this September.

First Installment

The new pool is only the ﬁrst
installment in the expansion of
the UniVersity’s physical athletic
plant. This fall construction will
begin on a development program
whose total cost will reach
$10,000,000.

The new sports center is due
for completion in September
1964. It will include ﬁve ath-
letic ﬁelds, two of which will be
convertible from separate foot-
ball and soccer ﬁelds to a base-
ball ﬁeld. There will also be an
all-purpose ﬁeld for intramurals.
These ﬁelds, as well as seven
tennis courts, will be lighted

‘ for nighttime use.
There will be four classrooms

.1 and a visual aid room for team

and supervisory meetings. All the
offices of the physical education
department plus the teacher train-

‘ing division will also be located

in the new plant.

Separate Women’s Pool
For the girls there will be a
separate pool. It will be 42 feet
wide and 75 feet long. There will
also be two womens’ free exer-
cise areas, two dance areas, and
two gymnasiums, each the size of
a basketball court. .
Rounding out the new facil-
ities will be archery and fencing
areas and fourteen handball
courts. In the building adjoin-
ing the immense pool will be
two basketball courts and a per-
manent gymnastics area.
Finally, two remedial suites for
handicapped children, and a physi-
cal ﬁtness laboratory for research
work will be provided.

Education Offers
Peace Corp Aid

Richard Wynn, associate dean of
education, reports that requests
for teachers are pouring into
Washington from all over the
free world. “Every country using
Peace Corps teachers has doubled
or tripled its requests. Elemen-
tary, secondary, and college
teachers in virtually every subject
are being sought.”

The School of Education will
give several kinds of help to ed-
ucation and liberal arts gradu-
ates or students interestedin the
Peace Corps; assistance with ap-
plication forms about opportuni-
ties, special aid during service
abroad and subsequent placement
in the United States. I

Dan Johnson, general manager
of WPGH, the campus radio sta-
tion, disclosed today that his re-
quest for additional space to ex-
pand his office this fall has been
turned down by the Student Un-
ion Board.

“I had asked for rooms 300,
301, and 302 along with the closet
and corridor leading to these
rooms in exchange for 308, and
310 which we presently have. We
are on the air for 35 hours and
which our staff works for at least
70 hours a week. Even “in the
Spring term we have about 35
staff members, and our present
space is just not adequate for our
purposes.”

The original request for addi-
tional space was made by John-
son on May 15, no action was
however taken by the SUB.
Hence Johnson wrote explaining
his difficulties and his expansion
program to SUB in another letter
on May 22. No action was taken
at SUB meeting last Thursday.

Cross Sums

Forrest Cross, president of SUB,
summed the boards position stat-
ing “We are all in favor of the
expansion activities planned by
WPGH, but we are not in a posi-
tion to comply with such request
at this time. Other student activi-
ties may like to apply for the
space in the Fall and there is a
possibility that the administration
may require some space for its
offices."

by WPGH. We will not be able
to take any action until fall
when all the requests for space
desired by the various organi-
zations is in and we have an
idea of the space available.”

Johnson said “I am disappoint-
ed at the value system of SUB,
their function is to serve the Uni-
versity and its high purpose, and
WPGH has proven to be carrying
out this purpose. SUB is not ful-
filling its obligationby not al-

“We use the space given us
most efficiently, next only to the

very easy for SUB to adapt to

requested for are hardly used.

“Moreover, I‘ feel strongly that

tion that does not at present have

Four’ Cents Saver!

Governor Lawrence’s abolition of the four percent sales
tax on textbooks illustrates a’ changing governmental atti-
tude toward higher education. '

Pennsylvania’s sales tax, theoretically at least, is a tax

aimed at those who can most ‘afford to pay taxes, those who V

buy luxuries. Thus, food, purchased in raw form from food
markets, is a necessity and non-taxed. The idea is that ev-
eryone must eat, but not in restaurants.

The opposite is the case with clothing. Everyone needs
clothing, therefore, ready-made, Garments are not taxed.
The needle, thread and material needed to make clothes,
however, are subject to the fourperecnt duty. While the
state wants no one to go naked, it considers sewing a tax-
able luxury.

.Education, under these stipulations, evidently was a
"luxury. This view is a cut or two above Plato’s —— he con-
sidered it a social danger —- but still one at variance with
twentieth century reality. A‘ luxury which merely permits
man to earn his bread as best he can is a scant luxury in a
society which regards equality of opportunity as its basic

I premise.

The present Washington administration seems to have
stepped beyond Harrisburg’s new outlook. It feels that edu-
cation is not only a luxury or privilege, but a necessity or
right.‘ ‘Pursuit of- Happiness’ is being redeﬁned as the right
for an individual to develop himself to the extent he is
capable of attaining.

Regardless of the success of this year’s ‘Aid to Higher
Education’ bills, some sort of recognition for the new de-
ﬁnition of ‘Happiness’ seems an eventual reality. Just as we
look with an incredulous grin at the bitter debate over estab-
lishment of public schools ,15’0lyears ago, so may our twenty-
first century descendents view our qualms,

The textbook exemption is not likely to make any stu-

’ dent wealthy. Total dollar savings over eight terms will not

equal one free credit: But totalintellectual savings over the
next‘ eight generations might result in incalculable social
earnings.

of us will want to avoid Venice because of the
open sewers, but the duck-hunters in the crowd
are sure to ﬂock there because of its popular Vene-
tian blinds. We are all sure, however, to ﬁnd
Florence enchanting (call RAvioli 3-62636).

Seven Hills

At lastwe come to the most famous of all the
Italian cities, Rome. As we approach the Eternal
City from the countryside, we espy first the well-
known Seven Hills of Rome: Mt. Vesuvius, Gina

Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren and Anne Magnani. All,’

of course, are volcanic.

Rome has been noted for centuries as a center
of world culture, an acknowledgement which ‘came
to a rather abrupt end l-ast year when Frederico
Fellini produced La Dolce Vita. This motion pic-
ture told the quaint story of how to be rotten to
the core and enjoy it to the fullest. In Rome, we
see the natives busily trying to dolce up their

vitas and, naturally, when in Rome, do as the
Romans do (in Rome, the number is MAcaroni
3-62636).

Rome. is also a city drenched in colorful history.
It was in Rome that Julius Caesar, poking fun
at his fat friend Brutus, jocularly asked him if he

had eaten two dinners that, evening. “Et two, ,_

Brute?” he jibed. Whereupon Brutus, being in a
poor humor that night since his Orgy Club Card,
had been cancelled, promptly poked back with a
razor-sharp can opener. .

Another famous ﬁgure in the ancient history
of Rome is Marc Anthony, who came to bury Caesar
not to praise him, but instead borrowed the ears
of his countrymen and set off to roam the world
to hear the Song of the Siren. He eventually
culminated his search in the chambers of Cleo-
patra (in Cairo the number is TAyl0r 3-62636).

More impressive, however, than any single ﬁgure
in Roman history, is the greatest structure of the
city, the Colosseum. This is a kind of large Pitt
Stadium, only larger. Here the Romans held their
sports events, and newspapers of the day, such as
Caesar’s Acta Publica often ran headlines like
these: “LIONS BEAT CHRISTIANS, 10-0,” or
“DOUBLE BEHEADER SET IN COLO TODAY.”

Enriched History

Still and all, it is not just Rome which has en-

riched the history of Italy. In all her cities, towns
and villages, Italy has produced great thinkers and
artists throughout the ages. The names of these
men, now household words, include Michaelangelo,
Leonardo Da Vinci, Enrico Fermi, Guiseppe Verde
and Frankie Gustine. Most famous of all the Ital-
ians, however, are Signor and Signora Sardinio
Anchovio. ' _ ‘
Sardinio Anchovio is remembered, of course, as
the noted peg—leggecl architect of Pisa, who in-
vented xthe ravioli. This is a delectable little
dumpling whose name may best be translated with
our comparable American term, “matzo ball.” It
is also interesting to note that Vespa was a de-

lectable little dumpling herself (in Pisa that num-'

ber is CApone 3-62636).

And so the time has come for us to leave Italy,
land of pointy shoes, cuffless trousers, racy movies
and Alberto Moravia novels; another stop on our
non-tour of Europe.

L -' Affair   Lee

Remember the “Lee Affair?” Sure, everyone
remembers. Understand what it was about? No,
no one understands.

We all remember it, but everyone lacks a
through understanding of those black headlines,
secret meetings, obscure “offi-
cial” statements. To the unin-
formedgit remains a shadowed
mystery valued at $100,000. It is
also a mystery which challenges
the very purpose of an educa-
tional institution.

To refresh foggy memories-
and dig among glowing embers
-—here is an outline of the
obscurity.

English Professor Lawrence
Lee took the floor a at Faculty
Senate meeting and listed eight charges aimed
mainly at the administration in the hope that this
action would pave the way for discussion without
fear. The charges varied from criticism on the
validity of courses and of oversized classes to a
question on the use of faculty members. At that

time it was mentioned that previous charges along"

these same lines were taken lightly by (the “high-
er ups.”

However, the “higher ups” didn’t take the, re-
marks of Lee quite so lightly. Instead, they hov-
ered a complete investigation over his head, and

for some reason, he had no comment on this ex- i

cept that the Chancellor knew what he was doing.

Threw Logs

The administration threw another log on the
ﬁre by appointing a seven-man committee to in-
vestigate and evaluate the situation. Oddly enough,
the story ended there. Supposedly, at present the

investigation is in full swing.

headline scanner is “Gripes, Pitt’_s got a skeleton in

their closet.” To the outsider —- which in this.

matter ‘includes students —— it appears that some-
one had the guts to step on some toes, but too
hard.

Many have wondered if such a dilemma should
have arisen from “good intentions.” And if it was
necessary to appoint a committee -—— we all know
how efﬁcient they are — to investigate the "matter.
No, it was not necessary that such action be taken.
At least not on the part of the administration. It

was up to the’ prosecution to pursue the case, to

provide suﬁicient evidence which would merit
specﬁc action — namely, hiring and ﬁring. The
administration should have given Lee and other
faculty members the go ahead to present a detailed
list_gf grievances. After all, a man is innocent until
proven guilty. Isn’t he? 4

H's Too Late

But it's too late for the “higher ups” to get

their feet out of the fire. The administration has
taken up the matter, and whether it tastes good
or not, they are now compeled to shed some light

on the subject and make it a matter of history. For. 

in a case such as this, where facts are obscure,
time breeds doubt. To be blunt, “What are you
gonna do about it?”

Bad publicity such as this should be erased
with a clear explanation, not a few phrases which
can be blown into spicy headlines. The administra-
tion owes it to the public, to the students — they
certainly paid for it —— and to themselves to bring
the matter out in the open, both sides of the ques-
tion presented, for the doubters to scrutnize and
evaluate. ,

Perhaps you say this is a case where we should
“let a sleeping dog lie.” But when it’s a “dead

2 dog’-’ it should be removed. Why? Because ,-“dead ~

Mellon Fellow Rejects

Atheist's Argument

Editor, The Pitt News,
Evidently some of your readers

were not convinced by Mr. Scriv--

er’s logic. This is not surprising.

Any logical arguments designed

either to prove or todisprove the

existance of an Inﬁnate Being is,
in my opinion,‘ predestined to
failure.
The reason is that most per-
sons have preconceived notions
E, on the subject. And, since these
prejudices are usually linked to
strong emotions, they are not the
sort of things that disappear
overnight. The appearance of a
Deist onvcampus would serve no
more purpose (supposing that the
purpose is to convert the oppo-
sition to his way of thinking)
than did that of Mr. Scriven.

I supose the reason most ofus
would give for believing in God,
if we were perfectly honest, is
that this belief offers us a chance
for spiritual immortality. We
hate to think that death means
the end of consciousness.

We would like to be free of
the limitations of time and
spaee——especially that of time.
Do we, then, create a God who
will give us immortality and
free us from these limitation?
Does God create man or does
man create God? Or does it
matter which creates the
other? The Spanish language
lends itself to a play on words
which seems appropriate here:
. Creer es creer—-to believe is
to create.

It seems to me that the con-
flict over the question of im-
morality and the existance’ of
God is, in the final analysis, be-

,_, tween faith and reason. Reason

is definately on the side of the
atheist. Faith, then, is reserved
for the Deist — and to an even
greater extent for the Theist.
The real question is not whether
you can logically prove the ex-
istance of a Creator but whether
you can combine reason and
faith without having one cancel
out the other. Nor is it a ques-
tion of determining the relative
merits of faith and reason; both
are important.

One way of resolving the con-
flict betweenthe two is, para-
doxically, not to resolve it at
all. Instead, we may make of
this struggle the very basis for
our existance. A painful, inter-
nal conflict between two incom-
patibles, the heart (faith) and

’ the mind (reason), can serve as
positive proof that we are alive
and vital.

The ‘reasoning’ is as follows:
to lose one’s consciousness
means not to exist; we must
keep our consciousness awake
by feeling—and we feel pain
best; to be in pain and to
struggle is evidence of being
alive; the conﬂict : between
reason and emotion’, between
faith and knowledge, between
wish and limitation can be-
come so intense that it pains
our consciousness thus offering
proof that we are vital.

If the only positive proof we
have of being alive and conscious
is this internal struggle between
two incompatibles, our life is
sustained by a contradiction, by
two contradictory ways of look-
ing at life and death. Although
this contradiction gives us our

vitality, we must attempt, as rea-
sonable beings, to resolve it —
hoping all the while that we do
not succeed, for to reach a solu-
tion is to be forced into a be-
lief (for or against the existence
of God) which will end the
struggle thus ending true con-
sciousness and life. One who has
become either a devoted Chris-
tian or Jew or a dedicated athe-
ist has resolved the problem and
ended the struggle and can only
be said to exist without truly
living. Either solution, belief or
disbelief, is too facile. There is,
then, such a thing as the impor-
tance of being in doubt.

The conflict between faith and
reason gives rise to what Don
Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936)
has called “The Tragic Sense of
Life.” Unam_uno, I might suggest,
is a man worth knowing if one
has not yet resolved this inter-
esting problem or even if
one thinks he has.

Student Says Bulletin

lts Very Unreliable

Editor, The Pitt News,

If the committee investigating
Dr. Lee’s charges on the topic of
“academic integrity” is looking
for verification, they need look
no further than the School of the
Liberal Arts Bulletin, 1961-1962.
In choosing courses for the
Spring trimester I made the mis-
take of studying this bulletin.

History 145, advertised as “Re-
cent American History, 1929-
Present,” caught my eye. The
Bulletin describes this course as
“an analysis of the economic and
international crises which have
faced the United States in, the
last thirty years . . . ”

I registered for the course, and
now, three weeks since the be-
ginning of the trimester, we are
up to the year 1916 in our “anal-
ysis” after having begun with the
Taft administration of 1908.

Fortunately, the subject mat-
ter is proving enjoyable. How-
ever, the_ University's principle
of false advertising still stands.
As I understand itnow, History
145 has started with World War
I (or a little earlier) for the
past several years. If this is so,
why hasn’t the Bulletin been
changed?

The fault lies not with the
instructor, but with the adminis-
tration. The persons responsible
for writing the Bulletin have
been negligent in carrying out
their responsibilities, and as a re-
sult are guilty of misrepresenta-
tion.

By SUSANNE ECKMAN

Jay Dantry, former University
student, is now selling books in-
stead of buying them.

The 1956 graduate in speech be-
gan working part time in 1955
while still attending school. In
July of 1959 he bought the store
where he had been working (in
half the area now occupied by
Yohe’s drugstore). Last May he
moved to his present location on
Fifth Avenue.

The Bookstall, which plays rec-
ords
you shop, caters mainly to Liberal
Arts students, with books on such
subjects as English, history, art,
and anthropology. Textbooks on
chemistry, mathematics, or physics
are seldom found on its shelves.

Mother Helps

Jay runs the store himself ex-
cept for the help ‘of his mother,
and seems to remember both
people and books with equal ease.
He attributes his knowledge of his
books partly to reading of the ad-
vance notices which are sent out
on them.

He “gets to know the fresh-
men in September when they
spend much of their time in the
store, looking and listening to
the records. Later, in their
sophomore and junior years I
seldom see so much of them.”

He takes care of the general up-

vkeep of the store himself, being,

as he says everything from gen-
eral manager, to janitor, to dish-
washer. He tells of a time when

“It Goes On..."

 

   

DECLINE OF AN EMPIRE
JUMBO JIM ELLIOT, the genial Irishman who coaches,
the reigning IC4A track champions, says Carl Olson, former
Pitt coach, “was the kind of guy who’d moan when he beat
you, cause he didn’t beat you by a half-a—point more.”

Olson, the mustachioed demagogue who coaches drama

students at Carnegie Tech now, was on the field at Villanova

A —  this weekend. He saw Elliot

repeat again; he squinted as

Pitt finished 23rd I with a

dynamic total of two and one-
half points.

He could sympathize with
the architect of Pompei.
Beats Own Drum

Olson won big at Pitt. He’s
an irepressibleegotist, has the
memory of an elephant, and
he’s not reluctant to polish his
own ivory tusks, which pro-
trude like’Wthose\ of a mam-
moth. .

His breed is just as extinct
at the University.

Olson can rattle off his ac-
complishments at :random—2
IC4A track titles, one IC4A
cross-country title, four Penn
Relay championships, four Olympic performers, and -better
than an .800 winning percentage in cross-country.

‘That’s why he wasnauseated by Pitt’s performance in
the IC4A, even though he wouldn’t say it. He was reluctant
to talk about Pitt’s track team, retarded by a touch of loyalty
for his old alma mater. _

He was pleased that Chancellor Litchfield had listed
him among coaches who inspired athletic greatness at Pitt
in his address at the All-Sports banquet.

Agrees With Chancellor
“He’s right when he says coaches have to inspire their

athletes,” Olson said. “I never had a full scholarship to give

out when I coached at Pitt—just tuition.

“Lots of kids came out on their own, proved themselves
and then got aid. I developed men. If you don’t develop men
you’re not a coach in my book. 2 A‘

“There was no nonsense when I coached. Boys didn’t.
loaf. Those who had scholarships worked out or they got
out.”

Olson dismissed the thought that Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton forced him to retire. “I quit on my own accord,”
he says. . v . .

“I had nothing to say about my sucesor. (Carl). Rees is
Hamilton’s man. Don’t go too hard on him. He must be the
best man because they have him. Rees may bejust a young
coach getting started—-maybe \he’ll develop into a champion
yet. I’m out so I can’t advise him now.”

Olson is a great advisor. “Spike” Harding, the Miami
University Athletic Director, can attest to that. “Spike”
recently implored Olson to reconstruct the track program
at Suntan,U.

‘ There was a bona fide coach there already, but Olson
admitted that ‘I really ran the show. For the past two years
Olson has worked with Hurricane thin-clads for five weeks
before returning to Oakland to resume his chores at Tech.
"Infected Life in Miami" ,

His Miami team was 9-3 this year. They beat the likes of
Duke, Florida A&M, Furman, Citadel,,Florida State and

A Brown. Miami went on to win the State college title.

Back at Tech, Olson piloted’ the Tartans to the confer-
ence championship in dual meet competition, and admits that
“Pitt has just as many good kids as Tech, but my boys work
like slaves. ,

“If a kid has two legs, a heart and lungs-—if you can
instill desire in him, he can do anything. I’m not a miracle
man, but whensl coached it was a 24-hour a day job, 365
days a year. You’ve got to be dedicated.

‘ “There was nothing when I came there,” Olson exclaimed.
“But we were always great afterward. We were always up in
the IC4A standing.”

When the current low interest in the sport was cited,
and Olson was told of the present situation, he sighed, “I’m
sorry to see things going that way.

“After you work a quarter-of-a-century to put the
sport on top—the equal of any in the country—you don’t
like to see it broken down. I’d like to see a return to the
old greatness. 1‘ ‘ V .

The real testwould come in a dual meet with Tech.

this small total, “everyone,” said
hurdler Joe Friend, “showed im-

Al Thomassey, for instance,

hurled the discus 154 and 156 feet-

in the qualifying meets and ﬁnals,

longest throw of the season and
gave him a ﬁfth place. Friend took
a ﬁfth in the 120-yard hurdles.

The mile relay team of Friend,
Vance Carter, Mike Slutsky, and
Steve Munter did not qualify.

However, they posted a time of

3:15, which was their best for the
season and only a second off the
school record. Dick Clark missed
‘qualifying for the hammer throw

The track team will send repre-

Joe Brown Wins

Edgewood Net Title

Joe Brown whizzed through
scores of opponents, 21 to be ex-
act, at the number one position
on the Panther tennis team. Over
the weekend he found the situa-
tion tougher, but he again proved
a champion.

Last week he had scored victory
after victory in the Edgewood
Country Club Tournament. But so
had the adversary he met in the
finals-—Jim Melville, age 35.

In the finals, Melville was los-
ing the first set 4-1 but stormed
from behind to win, 7-5. Brown
then won the second set, 6-4, af-
ter also being down. 4-1. Then he
finished off Melville, 612.

Ralph Mason, another Pitt net- '

ter, mentioned that “Brown had
clear sailing after he - solved
down his backhand. ‘

Cats Held

¢Carlisle Loses 2nd;

To 4 Hits

. By BOB SMIZIK ‘
Navy took advantage of the wildness of Pitt pitchers t

score an easy 9-1 victory over the Panthers at Annapolis Sat-

urday. The loss lowered the Cats recgrd to 9-5 against (:01-
legiate competition and 11-6 overall.

Panther ace John Carlisle was not his usual effective self
against the Middies as his control deserted him and he last-

only four innings.

Navy jumped off to a. 2-0 lead
an the end of three innings and
once they killed a Panther rally
inthe fourth they had clear sailing
the rest of the way.

Double-Play Hurts
’Al Riccuiti, who had two of the
Cats four hits, started the fourth
with a single and advanced to
second on Paul Martha.’s walk.

John Ciofﬁ, who had Pitt’s other

two hits, singled home the short-
stop, but Drew Williamson nipped
the budding rally when he ground-
ed into a double play.

‘ After Carlisle issued two
walks in the ﬁfth, his seventh
and eighth. he was relieved by
Andy Alex, who was no more
successful. The sophomore hurl-
er allowed two runs in the ﬁfth
another in the sixth and four
in the seventh, as he too suffer-
ed control problems.

In the seventh Alex walked
ﬁve consecutive men to account
for the four markers. Jim Sylvis
and Harry Kane ﬁnished out the
game without giving the Midship-
men any more runs. '

The middies had six hits and a
whopping 14 walks while compil-
ing their nine runs.

The Navy game and the re-
mainder of the season have to be
rather anti-climatic for the mit-
ters since they came so close to

«being picked for the NCAA
playoffs.

Bobby Lewis’ charges travel to
Kent State for a game tomorrow
and then end the campaign Satur-
day against Allegheny where they
will seek revenge for an early
season loss.

This year the first-string team

Coach Leo Bemis is ﬁnding it
in Pitt’s backyard.

Bemis attended the first annual All-WPIAL soccer game and
at Edgewood Grove in South Park a few weeks ago, but couldn’t

;,

difficult to recruit soccer players

touch any of the cream of the dis-$
trict’s crop. ‘

“Grades,” Bemis grunted. “There
isn’t one of them who can qualify
academically for Pitt. I’d like to
bring some of these boys in, but
they can’t make the grade.”

Brother Fails
One of the players was Paul
Liberati’s kid brother, who pos-
sessed the best toe on the ﬁeld.
His brother was named honorable

mention All-American last year
as a junior here.

Only six WPIAL schools com-
pete in soccer, and two area prep
schools play in the fall. Last
year, Bemis, possessing new-
found scholarship aid, dealt
three of them to area lads.

Two of those worked out suc-
cessfully here, but another cou1dn’t'
cope with theiacademic segment.
Bemis will give out about ﬁve
half—scholarships in the East this
year.
