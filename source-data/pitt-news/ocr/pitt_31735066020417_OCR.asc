Ferraro blasts »

Regan presidency

Ilona Segedy
The Pitt News

Winning Pennsylvania has
become a must for Democratic pres-
idential hopeful Walter Mondale.
Saturday afternoon his ‘running
mate Geraldine Ferraro campaigned
at Station Square, seeking Pitts-
burgh’s support.

A large crowd patiently awaited,
Ferraro’s late arrival, caused by
severe fog conditions at Greater
Pittsburgh Airport. The only way to
describe her reception was enthusi-
astic — she was warmly greeted by
chants of “Gerry, Gerry!” amidst a
waving sea of red, white, and blue
“Mondale - Ferraro For America”
signs. . . 4‘ _i

. Ferraro’sg 25-minute speech
openly attacked President Reagan.
She blasted Reagan for four years of
inactivity on arms control and for

. failing to meet with the Soviets until
, now, only weeks before election day.
s Everygeneration faces an overriding
~ concern, she said: “For ours it is to

stop the arms race and keep the
peace  We [she and Mondale] are
committed to negotiating with the
Soviets to achieve a mutual, verifia-
ble nuclear freeze.”

Ferraro took a shot at the Reagan
administration’s foreign policy by
citing the three bombings of Ameri-
can installations in Lebanon as “out-
rageous mistakes.” Charging

Reagan with failing to take responsi-

bility and making excuses, she called
for an end to the politics of blame.

“A leader must be big enough to
admit his mistakes and learn from
them. I want.a president who wor-
ries more about protecting'Ameri-
can lives, and less about protecting
his own image,”'said Ferraro.

On education, , Ferraro said,

_ “Ronald Reagan wants to cut educa-

tion funds, and he wants to launch a

teacher into space. I say, let's help
students and teachers here on
earth.”

About toxic waste dumps, she
challenged that Reagan allowed
toxic chemicals to leak poisons into
American soil and water. “I say we
should have a governrnentgthat takes
polluters to court, not to lunch,”
said Ferraro.

Ferraro also attacked Reagan on
the issue of unemployment, saying

that his steel policy boils down to‘ .

“Let it rust” and that he “pats him-
self on theback for exporting our

jobs” to foreign countries.

“Mr. Reagan has no idea of’ the
pain his policies are causing. He tells
the unemployed to check the want
ads. The problem is,- the unem-
ployed don’t get allithose foreign
newspapers where their jobs are
being advertised,” said Ferraro.

Questioning the Republican sense
of patriotism, Ferraro. remarked

“This White House thinks that com-

mercials made on Madison A.ve_nu_e"

equal patriotism. Let's not flaunt
our flag with television ads. Let’s
honor it with human deeds.”

Buslane discussed

By Joel Bloom
The Pitt News

A Port Authority official says that
Pitt students take a cavalier attitude
about the. Fifth Avenue bus lane,
contributing to the safety problem
there.

Thomas Litke of PAT said he has
seen students sitting on and strad-
dling the metal barriers of the bus
lane. Others, he said, “cross in the
middle of the street and crawl under
the railings.” '

Litke recalled one instance where
he saw a man walking down a street
reading a newspaper. To avoid the
crowded sidewalk, he hopped onto
the bus lane and walked down it, still
reading his paper.

Litke made his remarks during a
panel discussion on the bus lane
aired last night on WPTS—FM. The
program, which also featured city
and university officials, was taped
last Wednesday and follows a series
of accidents on Fifth Avenue involv-

ing Pitt students. .
_ “PAT is eager to work with Pitt
and city planning to come upwith
something which_ will help mafé the
[bus lane] situation safer and people
more aware,” Litke said. “Safety is
the main issue here.”

Litke also addressed the problem

, of speeding automobiles. “Excessive

speeding is not the problem,” he

explained. “The limit is now 20 mph.

Perhaps it will be reduced to 15 mph.

We are, though, going to have peo-

. ple testing,’ our drivers to see if
they’re speeding,” he said. ’

To reduce the number of buses on
the bus lane, Litke stated that some
of the buses, 61A and B speciﬁcally,
will be re-routed to Forbes Avenue
as of ‘Nov. 18. He said that access
will be at Forbes and Craft Avenues.
“Hopefully, this will help reduce
some of the overcrow‘ding. A bal-
ance will be struck. If we switch
more than the 61's, it will upset the
balance of the traffic ﬂow. It will

‘ break "down the light pattern,” he
said. _ ‘ .

Other suggestions were put forth
-’ that members of the panel felt would
make Oakland a safer place, includ-
ijlg the _installation .'of beepers on
buses to forewarni unsuspecting
pedestrians. Although, according to
Litke, the department of transporta-
tion will ‘only allow such devices on
heavy construction equipment.
However, he said, other radio alert-
ing methods such as electric eyes
hung from poles to be tripped-up by
oncoming‘ "buses could be
implemented..

‘‘It’s like tryin_g to run across the
turnpike!” gasped one student after
narrowly escaping a wall of -oncom-
ing traffic. _But in the opinions of
many Pitt students this comparison
between an interstate and Fifth
Avenue is pretty_accurate. Since the
fall term began, Fifth Avenue has
been the scene of several accidents
and numerous close calls between
pedestrians and the heavy masses of
traffic. K ‘

This week’s poll is based on two
major questions: How students feel
about the ‘traffic situation on Fifth
Avenue and how the traffic acci-
dents have ‘influenced public opin-

‘ion. 1 went out onto the sidewalks

along Fifth Avenue toask Pitt stu-
dents the following questions:

0 What is your opinion about the
traffic situation on Fifth Avenue?

0 Have you ever had a close call
while crossing this street?

0 What probable causes/ solutions
could you offer in respect to the
recent accidents here?_

_ 0 Have the accidents here made

cross the street? -

The negative reaction to the traf-
fic situation on Fifth Avenue was‘
overwhelming: 81 percent of__ the
polled students had something bad

to say about the traffic. One student ‘’

said, “I swear that the traffic speeds
up when you step onto the

Another student said, “I don’t

The 19 percent of the people that —

tle apathetic. They maintained that ,
Fifth Avenue was just like any other
street. “You just have to watch out A

The Pitt News

Kenya, March 1984 — Michael
Burgbacher is a resident director on
the University of Pittsburgh’s
Semester at Sea program, a sort of

ﬂoating school for undergraduates
that travels around the world each
semester. Michael begins to feel nau-
seated in Kenya and decides to visit a
hospital before the ship departs with
its 500 students and 150 staff
members. The doctors there can ﬁnd
nothing wrong with Michael and

release him. He returns to the ship
and continues to Sri Lanka.
Michael's condition worsens, and he
enters a hospital there, where he is
diagnosed as having a very strange
allergy. It is called Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, a violent reaction to the

sulfur content in a medication for
malaria that Michael has been tak-
ing. His condition improves slightly,
but, he decides not to return to ship
and continue the voyage. Shortly
after, Michael ’s condition again beg-
ins to deteriorate, and he dies within
48 hours.

Negumbo, Sri Lanka, April 1984
— Three male students from the
Semester at Sea are on free time and
decide to swim across a river delta to
a nearby island. Two students jump
in, but one, Bruce Felman from

George Washington University in 1

Washington, D.C., has his camera
with him and decides t_o return it to
his room. Saying he'll catch up,
Bruce runs back, and the other stu-
dents swim away without him.
According to the two students,
Bruce never came back, and no one
knew of his whereabouts until two
days later. In the town of Negumbo,
14 miles down the coast, some
natives found Bruce's body on the
_ beach. The autopsy, done in Sri
Lanka, conﬁrmed the reason for his
death as acciden_tal drowning.

Last semester, two members of
the University of Pittsburgh’s
Semester at Sea program died
before the program’s ﬁnish. With
traffic problems and the general
dangers of everyday life at Pitt, such
a small number seems almost insig-
nificant. These deaths, though, did
not occur in Oakland; they took
place in Sri Lanka and, due to the
circumstances, have been receiving a
great deal of attention from both the
university community and groups
abroad. ‘ '

According to Dr. Max Brandt,.

‘assistant dean of the Semester at Sea

program at the University of Pitts-
burgh, “These deaths are no differ-
ent from a car accident on the streets
of Oakland.” He explained that the
percentage of deaths to the number
of total students in the program was
probably the same as that of the stu-
dents attending school in
Pittsburgh. 

“Two deaths in one” semester is
very rare,” Brandt claimed.

The case of Michael Burgbacher is

‘also rare. The health requirements

for both students and staffon the
Semester at Sea are strict.’ Brandt
stated that, in the history of the
Semester at.Sea program, “We have
never had illness caused by the
voyage that led to death.”

The current dean of the Semester
at Sea and a boarder on last semes-
ter’s voyage, Dr. John Tymitz,
claimed that Burgbacher’s reaction
to Fansydhar, the malaria medica-
tion, was unpredictable. f‘Doctors in
Sri Lanka said they had only come
across a reaction such as Stevens-
Johnson syndrome in 3 out of over 1
million tourists in recent years,” he
said.

Dr. Max Brandt stated that a list
of required and recommended shots
pertaining to each country visited by
the ship must be completed before
the students and staff start the
voyage. The Semester at Sea ship is

also equipped with a full health cen-
ter and a physician. The medication
for malaria that Burgbacher was
taking was prescribed for him, and
the prescription was a routine one.
Students and staff members from
last semester’s voyage agreed that
many people got their necessary
prescriptions in the United States
before departure last January.

Despite the rarity of the Burg-
bacher case, on future Semester at
Sea voyages extra precautions will
be taken. Students will be warned of
all early symptoms of any allergic
reactions associated with the medi-
cations they may use.

Semester at Sea also has frequent
programs -advising students on
behavior and safety. Tymitz des-
cribed Bruce Felman’s drowning in
Sri Lanka as “terrible.”

- Tymitz said that before the ship
docked in Sri Lanka, the students
were specifically warned, “If you
don’t see the natives swimming in
the area, don't go in the water.”

Sri Lanka has an abundance of
attractive beaches —- and a very dan-
gerous undertow of which the
natives there are aware.

The codes of behavior in individ-
ual societies and how to conduct
oneself in a foreign cou_ntry are the
focus points of the Semester at Sea
program, according to both Tymitz
and Brandt. In Brandt's opinion,
though, rules “cannot be enforced.”
The students are treated asadults,
and field requirements or individual
assignments take them far away
from the ship at ‘times.

“There are many voyages where

nothing happens,” Brandt added. ‘
' “The record of the Semester at Sea

program is very good, with only four
to five deaths in a 15 year period 
Most of those are due to traffic
accidents.”

The biggest problem in previous
years has been motor accidents,
especially in Indonesia, where cars

Court being held at Pitt

By Bill Nichie
The Pitt News

Federal Court proceedings begin
at Pitt today. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the third circuit hears
arguments inside the moot court-
room at the School of Law today,
tomorrow and Wednesday, from 10
a.m. to l p.m. each day.

At the proceedings, a panel of
three judges will hear the arguments

' of lawyers representing each case.

,4!



 

All the cases are on appeal, which
means they would have already been
heard or thrown out of court.

It is up to this panel of judges to
hear these arguments and decide if
the issues of appeal are important to
the outcome of the case. If an issue_is
judged important by the panel, then
the case can be sent back to court for
a re-trial. 4

‘By the time a case reaches a circuit
court, itmay be on its second or

‘ third retrial. It is the complexity and

depth of these cases that is of interest
to law students; Its petitioner is John
Kubalek, who was an employee for
the Mears Coal Company for 15
years. After voluntary retirement
because of breathing difficulty, he
filed a black lung benefits claim with
the U.S. Department of Labor. At

the hearing before an administrative
lawjudge, Kubalek presented an X-
ray entitling him to total disability
due to black lung disease.

In rebuttal to Kubalek’s X-ray,
Mears Coal Company presented the
reports and opinions of two physi-
cians who examined Kubalek and
concluded that he was not disabled.
Thejudge noted that one ofthe phy-
sicians’ reports included an “after-
exercise blood gas test,” the results
of which were serious enough to
qualify Kubalek for total disability.

Thejudge noted the apparent con-
tradiction between the results ,of the

‘J “blood gas test" and the physician’s

conclusion of no disability. He dis-
counted the physicians’ opinions
and awarded full benefits to
Kubalek.

But on appeal, the benefits review.
board concluded that the judge had
improperly substituted his own
interpretations of the “blood gas
test” for that of the medical expert.
The board therefore reversed the
award of disability beneﬁts to
Kubalek. .

Now the case is on appeal for the
second time. The issue that will be
examined is whether the benefits

review board looked at all the sub- .

_ Five other cases will be heard on
Monday and Tuesday, and three will
be heard on Wednesday.

Assistant Dean Seeburger of the
School of Law feels the arguments
will be of real educational value to
students. “This will be the first time
ever that the Third Circuit Court
convened in Pittsburgh,” said See-
burger. “Usually, the Third Circuit
Court convenes in Philadelphia."

Oral argument proceedings differ
from the stereotypic guilty/ innocent
courtroom cases,

I “In oral argument proceedings,
the judges are very well-versed in the
background of each case, and what
generally happens is they interact
with the lawyers more than say, in a
case where they only know the facts
of the case and they have to sit and
listen to a lot of testimony," See-
burge_r said. ‘ " '

Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert of the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals has
also added some features to the oral

' arguments to add to the student edu-

cational experience.

Judge A1disert’s clerks will pre-
pare summaries of the facts and
issues in each case and distribute
them to the audience. The judges
will also meet with the audience after
each day’s arguments to answer any
legal questions.

Holiday gift shopping season is fast approaching, and once
again, toy manufacturers are showcasing their product innova-
tions to the kids of America. Saturday cartoons are riddled
with commercial breaks declaring “brand new, be the first in
your neighborhood” playthings and “must have, better than
ever” accessories and variations on last year’s models, the1atter
type being predominant. In lieu of risking a large financial loss
by bankrolling an advertising campaign for what may not be a
popular play item, toy companies find that relying on the
reputations of tried and true products allows for larger profits.
The Mattel corporation is just a case in point.

As makers’ of the Barbie line, Mattel has had to spend little
on advertising new variations on old themes. America already
loves Barbie, and of course, little girls would love to. have

' Barbie’s companions, wardrobes, housing arrangements and

transportation devices. They practically sell themselves.

. Recalling the success of its Cabbage Patch Kids last holiday
season, Coleco, too, hopes to bank on an old favorite by
introducing the Kids’ younger siblings. This is not to slight the
Coleco corporation for wanting to turn a profit; however, we
are dismayed at the lack of forethought and sensitivity. They
could have called the new brothers and sisters “Cabbage Patch
Babies” or “Brussels Sprouts” or any other play on the names

of the Cruciferae family. But no, they chose to call them the b

Cabbage Patch Premies. .

Coleco’s premies are cute and cuddly. They would have been
Cabbage Patch Kids but there’s an explanation on the boxtop
to the effect that there was so_me unpredictable frost and the
crop had to be harvested early. It’s a nice box. Cabbage Patch
Premies need love —- and their matching wardrobe, over there

to your right on the toy isle — and then they’ll be just fine. ’

Coleco’s Premies will give you and your child hours of happy
play time. '

Real premies are not cute. They are too small to be cuddly
because they weigh between two and four pounds, sometimes
less, and they haven't developed any body fat. Besides, who’d
want to cuddle something that’s got tubes and wires sticking
out of its every orifice and numerous veins, including the scalp.
Some premies don't get nice boxes.Wood boxes are not nice
boxes. ’

As to the meteorological event, if only it were limited to that
one factor. The facts are that what causes premature deliveries
in about nine percent of pregnancies are varied and many.
Weather is relatively predictable and suitable precautions can
be taken to prevent “damage to the crop." Fetuses can't be
covered with plastic traps.

Premies are not just fine after they’re born. Until recently,

their wardrobes were not readily available, but their fashiona-

ble attire is the least of their problems. Premature infants are

often afflicted with repiratory problems, as their lungs are

rarely developed enough to have the capability to breathe.
There are numerous other medical obstacles to overcome for

_ a premie to survive. There are numerous effects from low birth

weights such as the potential neurological damage from an

’ intraventricular hemorrhage — a spontaneous bleeding in the

brain. The list is overwhelmingly long and dismal. Fortu-

, nately, many babies do survive and the detrimental effects

minimized. It‘s not happy playtime for the parents, though.

What about the parents? They suffer financially, mentally‘
‘and emotionally for a very long time. The parents hope their

premie will live and make it through the holiday season_— this

’ one and many others. If they are fortunate enough to have their
’ child survive, they needn't be reminded of their pain each time

they walk down a toy store aisle or when they pass a child on the
street who has the new Coleco premie. And, no, parents of
premature infants do not want to buy their sons and daughters

» premie dolls and say,“Look, Amy, your new doll was prema-

ture, just like you.”

Somebody at.Coleco screwed up royally with this year’s
model, and we wish them little success and even recommend
people don't buy the dolls until Coleco changes their name.,and'
apologizes to the parents and families of premies ——-, the real

(Name withheld by request)

Prof. calls
for activism

Three Pitt students per month are
being maimed and crippled by pub-
lic buses on the Fifth Avenue speed-
way that bisects the campus. At this
rate, we will witness two dozen simi-
lar ‘tragedies this school year.

To put this problem in pCtapcc-
tive, consider that the seven amuse-
ment park deaths that occur per year
in this nation have prompted Con-
gress to draft legislation that would
improve and enforce safety stand-
ards at ‘carnivals and amusement
parks.

It took many ‘injured students and
too many years -for the Posvar
administration to construct the
inadequate railings that line the side-
walks in front of the dormitories.
How many tragedies and how long
will it take before the chancellor
takes this issue seriously and reme-
dies this situation?

_If more than 8,000 students can
agree to get their faces painted .to
watch Pitt lose to Oklahoma, surely
the same undergraduates have suffi-
cient school spirit to muster a few
thousand volunteers who could
devise ways to shut down traffic on
Fifth Avenue and stimulate Chan-
cellor Posvar to do something signif-
icant in correcting this problerfi.
Many of the tragedies could have
been avoided. But what is more
important is that_ future tragedies
can be prevented. Now, with quick
and effective action.

[Students, protect your lives. This
is somewhat more important than
getting into the Guinness Book of
Records by putting-paint on your
fa_ces.] Show us that you care about
yourself and each other.

In the meantime, while the car-
nage continues, I suggest that
responsibility for telephoning par-
ents of these victims of Fifth Ave. be
transferred from the staff of the
emergency room at Presbyterian

- Hospital to Dr. Posvar.

Mondale no
spark just
Solutions

William Pierce’s Sept. 17 column
in The Pitt News has prompted me
to reply to the continued assertions
of Walter Mondale's negative out-
look. The main proponent of this
view of Mondale and the Demo-
cratic Party is, of course, President
Reagan. I would like to examine this
assertion in the context of my under-'
standing of what a leader is and the
statements and actions of Mondale
and Reagan. '

First, how can we identify some-
one as an effective leader? I think we
can isolate three characteristics an
individual must A possess to be an
effective leader. A leader is someone

who recognizes the problems we’
face, someone who can offer rele-
vant solutions tojthe problems and.
someone who can motivate us to
address these problems.

Does Mondale recognize the
problems our nation faces in the
near and distant future? He points to
the deficit and nuclear arms control
as the two major problems facing the
U.S. But he goes further, suggesting
we need to examine issues in civil
rights (e.g., ERA), education,
energy and the environment.

What solutions has each man

‘offered for these problems? Reagan

doesn’t acknowledge any problems,
therefore he offers no solutions
except “stay the course.” The course
that has created $200 billion deficits,
a greater disparity between upper
and lower income groups and pro-
duced no arms talks. Maybe these
aren't problems? Mondale’s propos-
als for the deﬁcit and nuclear arms
control have been explicitly stated.
He will reduce the national debt by
creating a Trust Fund financed by
increased taxes on individuals earn-
ing over $25,000 per year. The
reduction of interest payments on
the national debt in "conjunction
with reduced defense spending and
control of social spending will
reduce our deficits.

Lastly, how do these men hope to
motivate us to act on their proposed

solutions? Mondale leads by exam- -

ple, that is ‘by showing concern,
working on solutions to problems

and by dealing with us honestly as.

intelligent people. He sees govern-
ment as a positive force in our lives.
Perhaps Mondale would suggest
that instead of asking ourselves "Am
1 better off now than four years
ago?" we should ask “Is my neighbor
better off now than four years ago?”
President Reagan, on the other
hand, motivates us using
emotionally-loaded issues such as
abortion and school prayer or-his
dreamy vision of the U'.S.-as illus-
trated in his television commercials.

The secret of the silver Winnebago

Title: The Secret of the Silver
Winnebago and Other Campus
Mysteries

Many strange and inscrutable
things go on everyday at the unbe-
lievable University of Pittsburgh.
What is the meaning of the 20 foot
circular stone monoliths the
archaeology department recently
unearthed right on the lawn of the
Cathedral? Why do many people
speak in strange foreign languages
on the second floor of Thackeray
Hall? Does it surprise you that

before there were elevators, there

was a giant sliding board from the
36th to the fifth ﬂoor in the Cathed-
ral, on which a secretary, if she were
fast, could drop off the mail for
every floor in one slide down?
Inquiring minds want to know._ But
why are they reading this? Hie Pitt
News, often imitated, sometimes
equaled, never sold, has finally
allowed the truth to be told: Sadly,

Its like taking attendance at a Fri-
day afternoon physics recitation: It's
dirty work, but someone has to do it.
I have dug up, on my own, wh_at may
be the answers to two of the real
biggies that have distressed students
since even before fall term!

What Are Those
Measuring?

Guys

Small bands of roving measurers
can often be seen sneaking around
the Pitt campus with rulers and tape
measures. Even the untrained
observer can spot them as they scout

everything in their paths.

funds were to be allocated for the
building of an olympic-sized, co-ed
sauna in the basement of the towers.
This sauna was to be accessible to all
enrolled students upon presentation
of a valid I.D., and this also entitled
them to cut-rate drinks. The Student
Senate thought this was great, and
they voted unanimously to fund the
program. But they didn’t know that
the proposal had actually been clev-
erly worded by the university‘s
lawyers. ‘

V In fact, what they voted for was
the establishment of the ultra-
secterive SMUT program, the
Secret Measuring of University
Things. It is their intention to mea-
sure everything! These maniacs keep
complete files on all‘ the distances
they have measured, and soon they
will havemeasured everything there
is at Pitt. If you saw the movie
“Strange Invaders," you know
there's something funny going on
here.

For The Pitt News

A new standard of excellence has
been established at Pitt's School of
Law. Richard Pierce, .Ir., professor,
lawyer, consultant and author, is the

new dean of the school. He brings to v

Pitt his wide range of experience in
both the public and private sectors
of the law community. He has stud-
ied, taught and worked from coast
to coast and this experience compli-
ments the law school’s developing
‘reputation as an institution of
national prominence. .
Pierce grew up in Philadephia and
earned his undergraduate degree in
economics at Lehigh University. He
went to work for General Electric
and Financial Management in Phil-
adelphia before entering the Coast
Guard for four years. From there he
went back to school at the Univer-

'sity of Virginia Law School and,

upon earning his J.D., entered pri-
vate practice for six years in
Washington, D.C. Pierce was drawn
back to the academic world, though,
and taught at Kansas University, the
University of Virginia and ‘most
recently Tulane University in
Louisiana.

"Along the way he became a con-
sultant on energy regulation, a spe-
cialization that has furthered his
experience in both the public and
private ends of law practice. He has

. been a consultant for the city of New

Orleans, various state governments

/' «3-.?~'-‘-r. '1.“x":=‘ “.—"i'3‘-"

New dean takes

and the federal government. He is
currently working for the Reagan
administration on the relationships
among regulation, deregulation and
federalism. Pierce periodically
advises private companies, such as
General Motors, and has found the
time to publish four books and pen
over 20 articles on the subject of
energy regulation.

The consulting will be put on hold
for now, since Pierce plans to devote
his energies to the responsibilities of
the deanship. When asked why he
left his post at Tulane, Pierce
responded, “I was very excited by
the opportunities here at Pitt. My
two predecessors as dean, Ed Snell
and John Murray, have done a great
job of taking this school from being
a very good local and regional
school to an. excellent national
school. They've done a particularly
good job at hiring and developing an

outstanding faculty.” As proof of

this, Pierce points to the results ofa
recent study pubilshed in the Jour-
nal of Legal Education which ranks

Pitt’s Law school faculty-in the top,

20 _ of I74" law faculties in the
country.

Pierce talked about a phenomena
he terms the “lag. time,” which
occurs after a quality faculty has
been established. “There’s always a
lag between a sohool’s reputation
nationally and what is happening at
the school in terms of changes in the
nature and quality of the program of
instruction,” he explained. “It’s only
been in the last two or threeyears

Hector Marin, a student of Latin
American Studies at Pitt, was on

also felt that the staff was more than

Maybe the biggest reason for the
pronounced sense‘ of tragedy accom-
- panying these deaths was the close-
knit relationship of all the students
and staff aboard the ship. Ruth Boy-
kin from Pitt’s Placement Service
office described the atmosphere of
the boat after pulling out of Sri
Lanka as one of “shock and deep
loss.” The students immediately
planned shipboard memorial servi-
ces for both Bruce and Michael. “We
had to ‘watch the students,” said
Ruth. ‘.‘Some tried to get away from

Clarke, who now lives in Sri Lanka

« expressed his regrets to the program

program but have a financial need.

‘ The directors, staff and students

of the Semester at Sea all seem con-

cerned that exaggeration of last

year's events may cause people who

are seriously considering the pro-

gram not to take ‘the step-and apply.

Hector Marin reacted to that possi-

bility by stating, “Anything can

happen in your own country, too.

It's up to the student to be
responsible.”

Newsbriefs

BEIRUT (UPI) — Official Beirut
Radio reported that a new plan engi-
neered by the United States calls for
Israeli troops to withdraw from
southern Lebanon within six to nine
months after the plan is approved.

Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy discussed the plan
last week with leaders during an
eight-day tour of the Middle East.

Beirut Radio quoted “well-
informed political sources"as saying
that under the so-called “Murphy
Plan," Israel would end its occupa-
tion without demanding that Syria
withdraw its troops from Lebanon
at the same time.

But Israel said that before it pulls
its 10,000 troops out, it will demand
that Syria promise not to move its
soldiers into the vacated areas.

And Syria reportedly has
demanded that Israel stop its land
and air attacks against targets in
Lebanon.

New law
dean

continued from Page 5”‘

that people across the coutry have
begun to recognize that Pitt’s law
school has entered that circle ofvery
few nationally prominent schools.
But now,” he added, “most informed
people in legal edcuation are well
aware that Pitt is one of the very best
and that reputation is starting to
spread throughout the legal
community.”

Is this new reputation producing
results? According to Pierce it is.

“Our placement effort has become
much more national and successful
in all markets,’-’ he stated. “We’re
enjoying greater success both in the
region that we have traditionally
served and in markets that, for us,
are new. We’re placing graduates in
law firms across the country. We
have a quality program in place.
What we have to do is maintain it,
build it and publicize it."

Promoting the law schoo1’s repu- ~

tation is done in various ways, such
as mailing brochures about the
school to prospective applicants and
also to prospective employers of Pitt
graudates. However, Pierce feels the
best publicity comes in the form of
the gradutes themselves.

He called them “our natural sales
force” and indicated that the posi-
tions they hold speak of the quality
of the program here at Pitt. Almong
past graduates he cited: Ruggero
Aldisert, chief judge of the third
U.S. Circuit Court; Governor
Thornburgh; Harold Schmidt, head
of the International Trial Lawyers
Association; and state Judge
Nathan Shwartz, president of the
Pennsylvania Trial J udges
Association.

Pierce is excited about a new
development at the law school.
Judge Aldisert will hold one session
of the Circuit Court in Pittsburgh in
the law school's mock courtroom.
The first session will be held Oct. 1, 2
and 3. The court will hear arguments
each of the three days from 10 a.m.
to l p.m.

“Judge Aldisert also has done
something that is unique in legal
education,” Pierce explained, “by
establishing a set of procedures
through which this three-day session
of arguments will become a major
part of our actual educational pro-
gram. Students and faculty
members who attend the arguments
will be provided with a summary of
the facts of the cases, the major
issues and arguments by the oppos-
ing sides and then, after each day’s
arguments, the students and faculty
will be permitted to question the
judges about the proceedings and to
discuss the proceedings with the
judges. This is an extraordinary
opportunity for our people to see
firsthand the way in which the
second highest court in the land
operates."

   

Israel invaded southern Lebanon
in 1982 to end a threat to its northern
border settlements by Palestinian
guerillas.

The catch-all bill covers the
departments for which a regular
1985 appropriations bill has not
been enacted.

(UPI) —- On the political front,
controversy won’t end over who
should accept responsibility for the
suicide attack on the U.S. Embassy
annex in east Beirut ten days ago.

The Democrats yesterday blasted
Reagan for not accepting the blame
for the attack. Walter Mondale, in
his weekly political address, claimed
that Reagan isn’t really in charge of
foreign policy. The presidential can-
didate said that Reagan is guilty of
“a default in leadership.”

Senator Gary Hart also criticized
President Reagan, saying “I'm wait-
ing for the president to stand up one

time and say ‘it was my fault.’ ” He
said Reagan also should have
accepted responsibility for last
year‘s suicide bombing of a U.S.
Marine barracks at Beirut Airport in
which 241 Americans were killed.

But Reagan Administration offi-
cials were not taking the criticism
lying down. A visibly angry Secre-
tary of State George Schultz said
that if anyone‘s head has to roll, as
he put it, “I am willing to have it be
my head." He vowed to do every-
thing possible to improve the secur-
ity at U.S. Installations in the
Mideast. ~

And Vice President George Bush,
campaigning in Cleveland, said
President Reagan probably will
accept responsibility for the attack.
But Bush also said that terrorist
attacks are difficult to guard against.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Fed-
eral employees were told to report to
work on Capitol Hill today even

though many government agencies
technically went broke at midnight
last night.

But lawmakers are working on a
two—day infusion of cash to ease the
problem until Congress can take
long-term action. The Senate is
hung up on civil rights legislation
and failed to break the stalemate
during a rare weekend session two
days ago.

But the lawmakers did send the
House a temporary measure to pro-
vide some funds through Tuesday.
The House is expected to act on that
legislation today.

But approval by the house of the
extra two days of spending authority
is no guarantee that the problem will
not crop up again Wednesday morn-
ing. That will just give the Senate
more time to try to unsnarl itselfand
go back to work on a year-long,
catch-all spending bill.

Stu dents
surveyed

continued from page one

Solutions to the situation were
wide-ranging. Thirty-six percent of
the students blamed the bus lane for
the problem and wanted to see it
removed. But a 55 percent majority
replied that Fifth Avenue is some-
thing that you must learn to live with
and that all that's required is just to
obey the crosswalks signs and to be
careful.

Overall, students have been
affected by the Fifth Avenue trouble
in one way or another. Over 3/4 of
the students now take an extra look
before crossing the street. And in
relation to those close calls, 39 per-
cent of the polled students have
almost been hit crossing Fifth
Avenue. So be careful!

tions. It was a hot and humid Friday '

afternoon, and everyone was in a
hurry to get home. It was also rush
hour. I The farther -I drove, the
thicker the traffic got and the more
perilous the driving conditions
became; it was every driver for him-
self. From the rising crescendo of
honks and yells and screaches of
brakes, however, came a gesture that
would make even the “Grinch Who

I Stole Public Transportation ” smile.

When a space formed between the
car before me and the one before it,
the car next to me sprang to life as it
lurched to fill the void, cutting off
and nearly hitting the car in front of
me. I thought that I was going to be
witness to a bonafide case of assault
when the passenger in the offending
car leaned out his window and
shouted something to the driver of
the almost-victim car. I thought that
harsh words would ‘lead to bigger
and badder things, and the jig would
be up for the red and sweating pas-
senger. This proved not to be the
case. The passenger leapt out of the
car he was in and handed to his more

than slightly miffed adversary ah ‘

perspiring, ice cold beer.

,.

Hopelessly

Sentimental

When walking toward my _south
Oakland apartment after classes
every day, I often pass small children
on their way home from school. This
has been a real source of pleasure for
me. So much do I enjoy the com-
pany of these children, in fact, that
the walk home always seems lonely

on rainy days when parents are at ,

entranceways and bus stops to pick
up their little tax deductions, there-
fore eliminating their walks in the
rain. I suppose that it’s the inno-
cence and open—mindedness of
children which makes me feel so
relaxed‘ in their company.

So, at least, I had supposed until
recently.‘Last Monday’s walk home

was a little disconcerting. A little girl V

and her brother -— both cute enough
to make the cover of The Saturday
Evening Post, and no older than
seven and five, respectively, were

involved in a heated debate about ,

something. This newspaper couldn't
print the ‘stream of expletives that
flowed from their mouths. Norman
Rockwell never. gave us a clue.

_ ing a new offense, the

goal three and a half minutes into
the half, cutting WVU’s lead to I4-
10. ‘

The 52-yarder placed Brasco in
the Pitt record books for the longest
fieldgoal, tied with Fred Cox (‘6l)
and Carson Long (‘74), who both
accomplished their feats against
Notre Dame.

Nothing happened for the rest of
the quarter, as both teams played as
they had for about 15 minutes after
the Mountaineers matched Pitt’s
initial drive, tying the score 7-7. Tail-
back John Holiﬁeld capped a 57-
yard drive with a one-yard scramble
eight minutes into the opening
quarter.

Then, with a minute and a half to
go before halftime, the Pitt defense
was victimized by the big play for the
third time in four "games. Split end

~ Willie Drewery, running a 15-yard

out pattern step for step with corner-
back John Lewis, bolted for the side-
lines and left Lewis hanging as he
corralled a 31-yard pass for six more
points and a 14-7 WVU lead.

' “We were a little ' too cautious
when we got down there on Drew-

ery,” Fazio admitted. “I don’t know A

how many times a receiver catches
the long pass and goes for the TD."

Dating back to Jan. 2, it’s already
been four different times.

The speedster Drewery later
doused any Pitt comeback hopes
with a 74-yard punt return 3:33 into
the fourth quarter. “I had lots of
punts [seven returns] today, I felt I
was getting closer and closer [to
breaking it],” Drewery said. _ “My
teammatessaid I was getting closer.
Plus you have some screaming
animals ‘on special teams. So I saw
two blockers [Arthur Ashe, Fred
Smalls] to my right and wanted to
use my speed.” '

After hitting the punt, junior
Chris Jelic added, “I saw the right
side; they had a pretty good wall set
up. As soon as he broke up the side-
line, they put a blocker on me. Usu-
ally teams don’t do.that, so I started
backpedaling waiting to get a shot at
[Drewery].” . _ -

‘ While he zoomed out of reach, the
Pitt offense showcased its weekly
rendition of “coping in quicksand.”
Inexplicably, Gladman only ran

nine more times after his touch- 3

down, missing a second straight 100-

yard performance by two yards.
Congemi, who played only during

the first half, completed eight of 16

passes for 83 yards, plus the weekly . 3 .

interception. After a Dave Grant

tackle rendered him useless the rest '

of the game, Jelic played the second
half, finishing with nearly identical
stats (9_-I8-92, one interception) and
similarly did not find any receivers
open.

“A lot of times they were doubling
up on [split end Bill] Wallace,” Jelic
said, “and playing man on [ﬂanker

A Jeff] Casper. They were sitting on

our underneath pattern, forcing us
to throw deep. But we’re normally
not-a deep team.”

Casper Jed all Pitt receivers with
44 yards on four catches while both
ﬂanker Chuckie Scales and Wallace
caught three passes for 42 and 40
yards, respectively.

Spikers  

continued from page twelve

One way the teamis preparing for
that important journey is byrutiliz-
5-1. The
Spikers-stay with one setter in this
formation (Rupp) and this allows
Gillespie to contribute more on
defensive. T

“It means I have to be pretty ﬂexi-
ble,” Gillespie remarked. “I have to
fulfill whatever role I'm in and still

‘ keep up the intensity."

The probable consequence for
Rupp is less opportunity to spike.
“l’ve always really enjoyed hitting
but right now our team has to estab- '
lish itself, and I’ll do whateverl have
to do to make that happen,” ‘Rupp
said, Nevertheless, sheadded that “I

" i_ ; ‘really.»_got into‘settin'g the 5-1.” 1  '  _

 

The line behind which Jelic takes
his snaps has been experiencing
depth problems as of late. Center Ed

guard Greg Christy sprained a knee

rest of the day in the locker room.
“I really don’t know why we were
jumping,” Jelic said of the line’s ille-
gal procedures.
knew we were going on two different

counts: On one and on a shorter
audible. We didn’t want to take any
aggressiveness away from the offen-
sive line.”

“If I had any explanations, we’d
be moving a lot more,” Fazio said.
“It’s experience if we have all the
guys there. I’m not blaming the play-
-ers. I’m really befuddled why we
can't do that. .

“It's a tough situation. We've been
in it a long time.” '

For its part, the Pitt defense sur-
rendered 319 overall yards to WVU,
166 on the ground. On special teams,
punter Jelic improved his 36.7 aver-
age by averaging 42.3 yards per kick
against WVU.

The efforts of the Pitt women’s
volleyball team this weekend at Vil-
lanova can be summed up in three
words: winning, learning and pre-
paring. While much of Oakland
mourned Saturday, the Spikers were

in the process of winning no less '

than 18 games (and losing none),
learning from past mistakes and pre-
paring for a trying weekend ahead.
The team raised its match record
to 12-! overall, but more impor-
tantly, raised its conference mark to
7-0 by defeating each of the other
three teams in the -Southern
Division.

“I’rn real proud of our team,”
stated ‘head coach Shelton Collier.
“We showed a lot of improvement in
;our ability to maintain our intensity
and our performance over an
extended period of time, which was

"one of our primary goals at this

tournament.”

Junior Sally Gillespie said that the
team had a good attitude over the
weekend and this resulted in a good
performance. “We were steady,
strong and confident.” _

Georgetown fell first, 15-10, 15-6
15-1 1, on Saturday. Seton Hall fol-
lowed suit, 15-2, 15-10, 15-6, as did
Villanova shortly afterwards, 15-10,
15-10, 15-6. ,

Then it was time to sit back, relax
and remember what happened last
weekend. A week ago, Pitt defeated
Princeton three games to none en
route to a four-match winning
streak going into the semifinal
match at the Temple? Invitational.
Their playoff opponent was Prince-
ton, who won this second time
around.

“We were determined not to let
that happen again this weekend,”
said Collier. “We seemed to improve
Sunday over Saturday.”

Senior setter Cathy 'Rupp
explained the team’s ability to main-
tain its intensity throughout six
matches. “We learned a valuable les-
son from Princeton, and we were
conscious of the fact that upsets
always happen on weekends like
this, especially in playing the same
teams two days in a row."

.“It wasn’t easy,” Gillespie con-
curred. “We had to realize that we
beat them yesterday but today’s a
whole newday.”

Pitt prevailed even more convinc-
ingly Sunday in relinquishing only
seven points to Villanova, winning
15-2, 15-1, '15-4. Seton Hall brieﬂy
‘rallied, but lost again, 15-12, 15-7,
15-2. Last to fall was Georgetown,
with Pitt winning 15-3, 15-9, 15-5.

Collier said his team was probably

-the most highly skilled team at the
tournament, and that the players
had worked a lot on fundamentals in

"practice last week. He said the main_ ‘

attribute of his players is quickness.
“Our defense, setters and spikers
are quick. They’re attacking theeball
quickly, and we were setting and
spiking the ball very hard before the
other team got to set up,” Collier
said. _
“Our serving was much stronger

than at the last tournament,” Collier .

continued. “Cathy had one of the

-’ best serving tournaments of her

career.”

Pitt was also impressive in the
spiking department. Ulana Kahu-
tiak led the tournament in kills with
41. Sophomore Sue Hoover
smashed 27 non-returnable spikes,
and Ruppc and Pat Belcher each
slammed 24. -

Collier noted the exceptional play
of sophomore Kris Wexell, “who at
5-4, is actually the major component
of our being a good team. She keeps
the other team from scoring.” 1

The final important aspect of this
weekend is preparation for the next
tournament, which is the Tennessee
Classic. Pitt will be playing such
national powerhouses as Nebraska,
Texas and Tennessee next weekend.
These three teams ‘are habitually in

If you happen to see Clara Peller
walking around the campus this

little -old lady famous for her
“Where’s the beef?” commercial may
be employed by the Pitt public rela-
tions department. After the Panth-
ers’ 28-10 loss to WVU Saturday,
everyone has to be wondering,

Picture this. The Panthers will

hallway leading to the locker room.
She will then proceed to beat her fist

founded (as they are) as to what’s
going wrong. After one more bel-
lowing of “Where‘s the points?” and

The Pitt ‘N'ew‘s’,‘;Monday.,' ’October 1, 1984'

- Clara will turn around and say, “I

don't think there’s anybody in
there".
As it Is well known by now there
are people in that locker room. It is
also known that they are good foot-
ball‘ players. Despite an 0-3 record,
many of the West Virginia
Mountaineers voiced concern
before the game over playing the
Panthers. Fullback Ron Wolﬂey
remarked that, “Pitt is a very good
football team despite the fact they
are 0-3. They have top athletes at
every position and we are going to
have to play our best game of the
season by far to have a chance.”
Tackle ' Brian Jozwiak seemed
even more concerned as he spoke of
a Panther rout. He echoed the senti-
ments of many of the Panther faith-
ful when he called Pitt “ the best 0-3

-team in the country”. He even went

so far as to say, “If we play against
them like we have in our four pre-
vious games, it won't even be close”.

If that’s all true, then what hap-
pened? Coach Foge Fazio was hon-
est about it. “Well, I‘m a little
bewildered on some of the things

that happened."

It all started easily enough. Pitt
took the opening kickoff and
quickly marched 78 yards on nine
plays to take a 7-0 lead on Charles
Gladman’s two-yard run. But after
that initial drive the Panther offense
was nowhere to be found. This has
been a problem area all year long.

Facts 8 3
  Figures

One reason for the sudden stall was
the defensive strategy of WVU
coach Don Nehlen and his assis-
tants,‘ who made adjustments that
affected the Panther offense for the
rest of the game. Of the 78 yards on
the opening touchdown drive, 60 of
them came behind the right side of
Pitt’s offensive line (a.k.a. Bill Fralic
territory). After that the Mountain-
eers “shifted over and brought their
cornerback up” and according to

Fazio, “they took the sweep away
from us."

With the play (sweep) that had
netted 53 of the 78 yards ofthe open-

. ing drive taken away from them, the

Panther offense died. On their next
six possessions, the Pitt offense was
able to muster only one ﬁrst down.
During the time,‘ they ran 28‘ [plays
and gained a grand total of 23 yards

The offense finally got going with
time running out in the first half, but
couldn't hit the big play. With two
seconds remaining, freshman Mark
Brasco attempted a 55-yard ﬁeld
goal. The result ofthat_ kick ‘illus-
trates the Panther offense perfectly.
lt fell short.

Brasco, however, was one of the
few bright spots. On Pitt’s first pos-
session of the second half he kicked a
52-yard field goal, thus tying a
Panther record shared by Carson
Long and Fred Cox. The “brightest”
bright spot was Gladman — he
appears to be taking over as the
Panthers’ most reliable running
back. Gladman rushed l6times for
98 yards and one touchdown. Over
the last two games, he rushed for 216

yards, which accounts for 64 percent
of the team‘s rushing offense. But
just as with the rest of the team,
Gladman gained 64 of his 98 yards
on the opening drive.

On the Panthers’ second posses-
sion of the second half, things went
back to normal. For on that and the
next three possessions it was the old
“ballroom blitz," l-2-3 kick. Like
clockwork, the Panthers would run
three plays and ‘then punt. A first
down had become a utopian con-
cept. WVU did come to town with
an impressive 35 percent in their def-
ensive column under third down
conversions. But they held Pitt to a
paltry 4-l7 which averages out to 24
percent, not exactly what the Panth-
ers had in mind. .

When asked about this particular
game, Fazio couldn’t find any one
particular thing that drained points.
“We got some breaks in the second
half, but we couldn’t take advantage
of them. We got the fumble early but
we didn’t hit anything and had to
settle for Mark Brasco field goal. I
thought that Chris (Jelic), once he
settled down, played good. He only

threw one bad ball, the intercep-

tion."

By the time the Panther offense
was ‘able to get a first down in the
second half, WVU‘was ahead 2l—l0.
Even then that drive was halted by
an iterceptionthat led to another
Mountaineer touchdo_wn. It was at
this time that fans started filing out

of Pitt Stadium mumbling to them- A

selves, “Where’s the points?"

With an 0-4 record and Penn
State and Miami both left on the
schedule, Pitt’s offense had better
get itself in gear fast.

Heavy losses tempt a team just to
go through the motions of playing.
But this is a team that refuses to raise
the white -ﬂag. Fazio, one of those
diehards, said, “It was one of those
days again. But as a player, I never
quit, and as a coach.l won.’t.quit.”

O The Pitt News

In a gesture beﬁtting the occasion,
Curt Cignetti entered the enemy

White, quarterback for West Virgin-
la, had Just accounted for what no
other Mountaineer team in i2 years
had accomplished at Pitt Stadium:
beating the Panthers. 5

“This is the best l’ve ever seen you
play,” Cignetti, a WVU player
turned Pitt grad assistant, said to
White after the Panthers lost their
fifth straight game, dating back to
the Fiesta Bowl, 28-l0. “I’m happy
f0’ ,Y0U; you were really sharP
today.”

Sharp? Throwing for 166 yards on
15 of 28 completions? Poll most of
the 58,032 fans attending Saturday
afternoon and the returns sound a
different call. In another gesture,
befitting this abysmal season, Pitt

. again found a way to beat itself. Not

' only did the Panthers commit an
astronomical 10 penalties — eight of
which were charged to the offensive
line — but their offense unveiled a
new -motto, “Three plays and a
punt" .

For the fourth time in four game
head coach Foge Fazio was once
again forced to play more than one
quarterback, watching seven of

5' Pitt’s‘l5 drives ﬁzzle in punts. Addi-
tionally, the Panthers only con-
verted on four of 17 third-down
situations.

“I’m a little bewildered about
what happened,” a beleaguered
Fazio lamented. “You can’t get
holding penalties, penalties that take
away from your consistency. On our
first possession we made up one
penalty, the second time we
couldn't.”

And what an initial possession it
was. Except for three plays, quarter-
back John Congemi handed off to
freshman tailback Charles Gladman
seven straight times, one culminat-
ing in a 35-yard sprint andanother a
two-yard TD launch.

It looked so methodical, then
poof: As quickly as Pitt thrust a
knife into the Mountaineers, its
offense headed for the nearest exit
sign. “We tried to stay with some
plays on the ground and go long on
other plays,” Fazio said. “We
needed to throw the ball deep and
shake up the defense. We came out
in the second half, got a break, but
didn't hit anything and naturally
settled for the field goal."

This was no ordinary three—point
play. After defensive tackle Jon Car-
