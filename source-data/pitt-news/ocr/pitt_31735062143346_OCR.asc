New York for one week between ex-
tended engagements, will provide the

Johnny Johnson, who-followed Ted
SVeems into the Grill Room of the Ho-
tel Pennslvania, will come ' to the
University campus during a brief one-
week furlough preceding his summer
engagement in the Roof Garden of
the same hotel. Proof of his popular-
ity with New Yorkers is evidenced in
his re-engalgement for the summer

season at the Pennsylvania, Chair-
man Van Nostrand points out.

The Senior Ball will mark the first
appearance of this young band master
on the Pitt campus. Johnson, i‘n the
past few years, has ﬁlled engage-
ments at Asbury Park, Atlantic City
and other eastern entertainment cen-
ters.

As the headliner at the Pennsyl-
vania Maestro Johnson has been fea-
tured by the National Broadcasting
Company in the late evening dance
broadcasts, playing an average of
four nights each week. He brings
his company of eleven musicians and
entertainers for_the Senior Ball._

Van"No'stran‘d‘and his committee’ to-
day were hinting of plans for a deco-
rative scheme for the Senior Ball
which, “in all seriousness," would
surpass previous attempts of this kind
here. A design of a decorative plan
was submitted to the committee and
approved last week. Work on the
construction of settings was to begin
early next week, Van Nostrand inti-
mated.

A program design, in keeping with
the decorative scheme of the ball, al-
ready has been approved by the com-
mittee.

Jobs Sought

Board To Appoint Heads of
News, Panther, Owl

 

Candidates for major positions OI!
student publications are now making
appointments for interviews next
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
afternoons with the Board of Publica-

tions. The board consists of Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women;
Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of

men, and Williani S. Maulsby, head
of the journalism department. The in-
terviews will take place in Heinz
House. D ,

Any‘ undergraduate‘ student, of
either sex, is eligible for any of the
positions to be filled at this time on
the News, Owl, and Panther. The
board considers grades, experience,
not necessarily on the publication in-
volved, and character as essential
qualiﬁcations.

Each candidate has been invited to
submit a detailed program for carry-
ing out his ideas for bettering the
publication he is most interested in.
A candidate may apply for as 111811)’
positions as he cares to.

It was pointed’ out by Mr. Maul-sby.
that the positions to be ﬁlled this
spring are not necessarily those now
in existence. That is, the board is
willing to consider applications for
chairman of any publication; if the
board is favorably impressed by an
applicant, he can name his own title.,

The positions, however, over which
the board has original jurisdiction are
the chief executive ones on the edi-
torial and business sides of the News,-
the Panther, andgthe-Owl. ,.

Ordinarily, positions on the" Owl are
given to students who are now second- ,
semester juniors. Positions on the
Panther or News are likely t0 g0 to
present members‘of the junior class.
The board, however, in the past has
been receptive to new ideas from-
whatever source they come.

Senior Queen And'Alrnai 

Rose Marie Demestichas

It,’.s' Spring Festival time, and an-
other queenly co-ed has just re-
._ceived the highest recogni_tion.~.11er
"classmates have to oifer. Rose
Marie Demestichas, whose friends
are unnumbered infall schools and
classes of the University, today
was named Senior _Que_en before
hundreds of fellow students who
attended activities tapping exer-
cises outside "Memorial Hall. Chief
among Miss Demestichas’ activi-
ties was her outstanding work this
year as president of WSGA

Dorothy Getsinger

Runner-up in the vote of esteem
taken by University women, Dor-
othy Getsinger today was official-
ly acclaimed as Alma Mater. Miss
G-etsinger, president of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, women’s _. social
frat'ernity, and a member of Senior
‘Court and‘Mortar Board, hasbeen
‘active in affairs not strictly asso-
ciated with the classroom since
her ﬂrst days at the University. .

Rose‘.Viarie Domestic-hes has been
selected by the women of the class of
1933 to be their Senior Queen, and
will become the eighth of the royal

lineage when she is crowned at the
Coronation ceremonies, June 6. Doro-
thy Getsinger, chosen Alma Mater,
will place the crown on her head.
Rose Marie, to put it tritely, is an
all-around girl. She has maintained
an excellent scholastic record
throughout her four years at Pitt,

because of her popularity has held“
the highest oflice Pitt women as a
whole can confer upon their leader:
the Presidency of VVSGA.

Her activities at Pitt have been
centered in W SGA. During her soph-
omore year, she was hostess chair-
man of that organization, then sec-
retary in her junior year, and ﬁnally
president. _ She was also president of
Cwens, honorary sophomore activities
fraternity. Other organizations to
which she belongs are Meda, Quill
Club, honorary literary fraternity,
and Mortar Board, honorary senior
activities fraternity. She is an Eng-
lish major, and wants to teach after
graduation.

Probably the most characteristic
thing about Rose Marie is her in-

~ terest in- people. She - has a-way of-.

listening so that you feel that what

Druid Oﬂicers 
Defend Election

Charge Robbins With Inaccuracy,
Unethical Conduct

 

Challenging the denouncement of
Druids, honorary sophomore activities
fraternity, made by Irving D. Rob-
bins, Col. '35, who resigned at the
close of Sunday's election meeting
when it became apparent that candl-
dates he had sponsored were not
elected, ofﬁcers of the fraternity to-
day cha-rged»~R./obbins 4-with r»-unet-hical
conduct and inaccuracies in stating
that members other thanhimself had
withdrawn from the meeting. Rob-
bins’ resignation was ofﬂcially recog-
nized by acceptance yesterday.

In a joint statement given the News
for publication, Joseph F. Novak and
Jules L. Green, president and secre-
tary, respectively, of Druids, refute
Robbins’ statement that the election
meeting was a “farce” and a “bur-
lesque,” asserting that it “was run
as orderly as any meeting could be
until Mr. -Robbins, without any basis
for protest, accused‘ the members of
not electing men whom HE thought
most worthy." ,,

The officers also deny the truth of
Robbins’ assertion that three men
withdrew from the meeting upon an-
nouncement of the newly-elected can-
didates, holding that Robbins was the
oniy member to withdraw.

For revealing in a, public statement
the secret methods of Druid election,
Novak and Green regard Robbins’
action as “an entirely indiscreet and
unethical move.” They further charged
-'l1ini‘wiith ‘failing “to consider the feel-
ings‘ of the men who will be tapped
today,” stating that he will have given
them the feeling'that they were not
outstanding, but mediocre men. This
they denied.

Rose Demesticlzas Named
Senior Queen, Dorothy
Getsinger, Alma Mater

 

has been prominent in activities, and .

you have to say is important. Among
her chief diversions are playing ten-
nis, swimming———and punning.

Alma Mater, Dorothy Getsinger, is
alsoa representative choice for se-
nior women to make. She has been
active since her freshman year here.
The large number of friends she has
made bear witness to her -personality,
the offices [she has held show her
leadership ability, and, to complete
the picture, she has an excellent
scholastic rating.

Among her activities have been in-
cluded the presidency of Kappa Kap-
pa Gamma, Panhellenic ,and Pitt
Players. This year she was a justice
o-f Senior Court. Other organizations
of which she has been a member are
Cwens and Mortar Board. Last Feb-
ruary she led the Interfraternity Ball
with Dan Smith, president of Delta
'l‘au Delta. '

The Coronation ceremony, which
will take place at Heinz House, June
6, after the annual Senior Breakfast,
has been adapted from the coronation
of old Angle-Saxon kings and queens
by Dean Amos. In this ceremony,
the part of the archbishop is taken
-by Alma Mater. Every woman in the
senior class will participate in the
ceremony, and members of the court,
now being chosen by the Senior
Queen nominating committee, will be.
announced next week.

University, Invitation Meets Staged Here Tomorrow

Pitt, W. Va.

, Frosh Trackers,,C|asl1§

The ‘West Vii-ginia varsi

-was a. ‘substantial margin ahead of
far this season. ,
Pitt ﬁgures to score most. of

Varsity,

 

ty and f_rcshn1an track teams will clash
with Coach. Olsen’s--spikers tomorrow: in meets held "in conjunction:
with the-‘annual interscholastic track and ‘ﬁeld meet.
eers are fresh from a decisive vict-

The -Mountain-

ory over \VaynesbL1rg,-wliile Pitt’

Temple" inthe only dual meet so

its points on the track, possibly

betn-g forced‘ to be content onlywithe

seconds, anti‘ thirds in the weightsl
and other ﬁeld events. Close observ-ll
ers see a good chance of victory fort
Pitt, t.he first in many years of track
competition with the Morgantowni
school. ,

Pitt will make its especial bid ini
t.he short and long dashes, the mile‘
and two-mile runs. Fleming and Ja-
cobson are both capable of bettering
VVoodford's time of 10.2 in the 100-
yard dash and 23.1 in the 220. Bill
"Keller should have little trouble heat-
ing Kennedy's t.ime of 51.6 for tile;
440, and 2 minutes 4.4 seconds, the‘;
time made by Zinmierman of Vvesti
Virginia. in the half mile. ‘f

In the ha,l.f;Inile..-‘K-cller is ﬁgured to;
set. a new University record if the;
weather is favorable. The 'pre-sentl
record is 1:5S.5, and Jieller ran the;
distance in 1:57 last week,_at the;
Penn relays. Other capable Pitt en-g
tries in the middle distance races are;
Mt-Donald, Watkins, and Kiger.

‘Wagenhouscr, Laurence and Kirk-1
patrick should all have no trouble
in bettering Zimmerman‘s time 01’
4:-43.1 for the mile, and Cliso has
several times bettered the VV'e.st Vir-
ginia time oi’ 10:16 for the two-mile
run. 1 y 1

But that's where any: Pitt superior-
ity ends. Coach Olsen has no hurd-
let‘ as fast as Bailey of the’ Moun-
taineers, no discus thrower who can
hurl the platter -as far as Hill; no
javelin thrower in the class of Ment-
zer, no hammer thrower who can
match’ Miller's great heave of 16:3
feet £4 inch.

Fleniingz; should approach Va_r1ier’s
mar-k' ot"'2i-"feet, 81,5; inches. Ericson
of Pitt and Parriot of W'est Virginia
are of about equal a.billt_v in the pole
vault. Competition in the high jump
should be close with neither school
possessing an outstanding performer
in the event.

If Emil Bonavita. gets off one of his
better heaves, he should beat Slate
for ﬁrst place in the shot put. This
event is Pitt’s best chance for a. lirst
in the ﬁeld.

West Virginia. possesses very little
.--er-ond and third place strengtli aside
from her sta.i‘s"ax1(l'sl1ou'l'd‘Pitt' pile:
up :2 lead on the track. Coach Olsen's
team will accomplish what l’a.nthcr
traclrers have failed to do these many
years, beat XX-"est Virginia.

_',f_;,'igi1-,y,iColoiicl McCorinic:k, publisher of the Chicago Tribune, ac-

g1'1'3edI"eﬂ.8tB~Tl1 collegcsand universities of fostering doctrines of rad-
 aiitl economic thought. Colonel McCormick, we believe,
has-*-attr-ibutcd a growing realization among undergraduates of the
fate that awaits them after graduation to a changed political theory
among them, wliicli  hardly the case.

As Dean Sicig of the University recently said in an interview,
uud:crgr2iduiites today are not the “collegiate” individuals they were
four years ago, but the change has been only skin deep. Students
ar‘c"feelin»g the pinch of the depression, and in many cases feeling it
very hard. It isaltogctlier natural that, being subjectcdto hard-
ships which they never before knew, they should begin asking them‘-
sclvcs the reason. - . ‘

7  But it is certainly true that the new attitude is only skin deep.

To ibel-icivc that undergraduates of the average university have
-'chan~‘g,ed:-fundamentally, or can, in their intellectual make-ups, 1S to

c1‘e(,l.i’t’i;heu1 with a more serious outlook than they evcrdcserved.

-On itlie other hand, however, the present about-face has been
wide spread. A larger number of students has been affected than
were, for instance, during the period of Mencken cynicism in the
twenties. That movement, publicized as it was, after all only ap-
pealed to campus intellectuals. It was not general. Today’s reac-
tion is .amon.g..iii_l:cllcct.uals anrl....plaiii .collegians.alikc, for the vic-
tims of the depression have not been chosen discriiuinately.

In few cases has the reaction taken a form that could truly be
called radical. The Marxists are few and far between. Instead of
accepting whole heartcdly some theory, students have shown an in-
tcrcst, and not much else. Their “radicalism” is still in a forma-
tive statc. Its fruition is far off and doubtful.

For the graduate of J une 7, the future is gloomy. And knowing
it, his reaction has been an ‘unus__ual interest in public aﬁairs. This

,-year's crop of job hunters with degrees will be politically minded.‘

Too many of last year ’s graduates have returned with stories of
washed out expectations to allow present seniors to forget that there
is no’ more college after June. A job is an imperative need for the
Pitt iiiiifl‘-i5"r~“ivonia‘n2 Our student body is drawn from lower mid‘d.lc
class homes in which a college education means sacriﬁce. Pitt. stu-
dents look forward to the day they ﬁnd cniploymeiit, and Pfly back
the obligation they have assumed in draining none too full family
bank accounts. .

Radicalism has not sprung up and spread over night during the
depression. But among college students, as among all other classes,

the acceptance without questions of things  they are is no longer

to be assumed.

The newly formed International
Council, an organization formed of
representatives of the various na-

give an “International Open‘House"’
at the Heinz House Friday, May 26,

LAST FRIDAY ’S election. it is to be hoped. has set a precedent in
student affairs. Through the efforts of Theodore Biddle, assist-

ant to the dean of men,-the fraud and attempted fraud that marked

elect;-3oiLs;.of..fOI:1ner.yeaa'S>‘Was reduced -to 3.ll~‘—ld'Eal minimum.

Unfortunately there has been no guarantee that campus groups
have permanently deserted tactics that made elections in former
years a farce, with the results always known before the ballots were
cast. Continued vigilance by the authorities is necessary.

But more important is that all politics be kept in the open-. The
high number of ballots cast in last week's election indicated that
when the political situation is brought forth in its true light, greater
intc-rcst is evidenced in elections by the student body. ‘Had the
voting students had a picture of the situation clariﬁed by past ex-
perience with a.more«‘01"less-“openly. competitive” field, the results
of the balloting might have been surprisingly different.

For the ﬁrst time, it seems, the independent voter, the formerly
disinterested student, rallied to the cause of a clean and uncon-
trolled clection. tlallot-box stuffing and similar fraudulent devices
were virtually wiped out. This, perhaps, because such means,’ were
unnecessary with so little opposition. But mild intimidation and
“blind" voting in an adherence to slated candidates yet remained.

The way, at least, has been paved toward a system of open and
honest competition. The present system of “grab all you can” will

best be brought under control by the growth of a healthy, honestly‘

motivated political opposition. XVhy not have that happen now?

tain far more people than I ever ii’-3-9

lleved possible have become self-up-.
pointed apologists for 'théj‘}Hl_tler re-
gime. They are extremely. irritating
for the plain and evident reason that

their arguments are downright ab.-
surd. While I hate to accuse other
decent persons of boun-derlsin... I

strongly suspect that ninety out of a
hundred apologists for the Nazis {are
ordinary Jew-baiters.

' The Real Dope

Let us take the most. recent of
Reich edicts, that of the “Germanlza~
tion” of the trade unions. This is an
openly admitted government activity.
Union officials have been jailed or
booted down the stairs. Two leaders
were taken to a hospital. They were
“ill.”

Is there any apologist to offer ex-
cuse for this? It is the open and
shut Fascist tec-lmique of suppressing
all opportunity for labor to ask for
and get its needs. It is a. step to-
ward the peonizatlon of the worker,
and it is only the first step. More, to
be sure, are to come.

Likewise undeniable has been the
suppression of the opposition press,
even that of the mildest variety. This
too has been done on official orders.
In fact, it has been bragged about.
How can anyone say that Gcrmaiiy
has not changed a.pprecla.bly,'when its
greatest voice has been gagged? The
visitor watching the automobiles go
up and down the Berlin avenues does
not notice these things. But the ‘Ger-
man‘ who ﬁnds his 'l‘ageblat_t, full of 1
the life and letters of Herr -Adolf!
does. - ‘

Or consider ‘the burning of un-
German books. The list of contem-
porary writers includes every 1irst-
rater in the country. .I presume that
the Nazis will be consistent, and in-
clude all works of Heine. They
might as well; for they are destroy-
ing about everything else that is
good. Not only will books in public
libraries be gathered for burning by
the common hangman. Private li-
braries will offer their share. "And
Storm Troopers are not always too
particular about their search war-
rants.

Supplession of News

And why all thistouchiness over
the foreign correspondents in Ger-
many? The American writers, of
course, put up a good, big bluff, and
came out on the right end. But in-
timidation of them was attempted. It
seems strange that Russia has noth-
-ing to fear in this~—matte1'. Many
dispatches, unfavorable to the Soviet
leave Moscow every day. Russia, ap-
parently, has nothing to hide.

Were it not that human being are
concerned, the Nezi stand on the
Jewish quest,i,onmii'o1ilg1, be,,_c,l_pwnriglit
laugliablc. ‘Their inconsi-steucles are
only outdone by their American
friends.

By olllclal edict Jewish lawyers
and jurists have been barred from
the courts. Jewish professors have
been thrown out of the universities.
Surgeons and physicians are ousted
from hospitals and denied the right
to practice. These men, and they
are many, are denied the good, old
right to earn a living, as have been‘
the business men subjected to the»
boycott. That is the simplest form
of persecution known. It does not in-
volve. “rights.” But it does take away
the bread, meat, and celery.

The Little Pogrom Game

There is also the rather tiresome
.argum,eI.1,f». 9.Vt>1‘.U}_8.pog_1:o1i_1 that fol-_
lowed Hitler's appointment to the
Chancellorship. Reports of the po-
grom have been many. And even if.
their treatise be divided by two, the.
fact of riotous persecution still re--
mains. Hitler had been promising‘
his hoodlums the chance to pull that
stunt for some years now. Jew-bait
ing was point number one in his pro-
gram for the economic rehabilitation
o-f Germany. And if "tire Nazis did
not run wild the day they took power,
they were awfully well disciplined
boys. which is another thing that no
uiiintoxicated gentleman or lady can
beneve.

Then there is that yarn about the
really German Jews being treated
with all due consideration,-th-e real
object of ‘the »Nazi prejudice being-
the Polish Jew. More‘ trip_e_.,~ ,

opposition, the trade union, and the
Jew. And the apologists may scream
their heads off from now until the
utilities give fair rates, and he still
will be a scoundrel. It" is diﬂicult. of

believed when we seethe University
cutting down the faculty, ceasing to
buy books, cancelling subscriptions to
technical journals andvastly increas-
ing the size of all classes, while, at
the same time, it prepares to waste
large sums ‘of money to keep up the
military department,-which denies all
the facts and teachings of the psychol-
ogy, , sociology anid history depart-
ments; which cynically distorts the
teachings of all idealists, religious or
scholarly and which ‘ dismisses ‘all
modern-minded individuals, including
some of the greatest men of our time
as “paciﬁsts” or “Reds?” Such teach-
ings, particularly since they are of the
vintage of 1918, glorify war, any kind
of war, make professional ﬂag wavers
and patrioteers; and propagate medie-
val ideas of civilization. If college
military training has any other value
we have yet to hear of it.

Yet, it is for the upkeep of such a.
useless and mischievous kind of teach-
ing that the University proposes to
starve the libraries, the laboratories

ties!

mentary this letter cannot urge that

‘May 2, 1933.
To the Editor, Pitt News:

tiou in someone’s mind of recreating
the Masoleum of Halicarna.ssus_, lin-
pressive in spite of filth, but looking,
nevertheless, like some neolithic
monster that squatted there ages ago

Speaking officially, and in behalf of Scholastic Honors Committee of
of Druids, we challenge the fallacies
made by Irving D. Robbins, in the
.:\L-33; second issue...of the Pitt News,
concerning the spring election of men
into Druids.

The meeting which Mr. Robbins as-.
serted tobe. a “farce” and “bu-rlesque”'
was run as orderly as any meeting‘
could possibly be until Mr. Robbins,
without any basis for protest, accused,
themcmbers. of not electing men
whom he T.l£l0l1gl1t,IIl.O'S_t worthy. Per-
h—aps‘Mr. Robbins is under the im-
pression that a group should deter-
mine its policies tlirough the opinions
of one, and not through those of the
majority. The election was carried
out in the manner speciﬁed by the
constitution and was attended for the

Tapping Reception next Friday after-
_noon
Heinz House.

The committee in charge of the at-
fair consists of Jean ‘Tents. Col. '33,
chairman; Helen“Turner, Col. '35, in-
vitations; Betty Carrol, Fd. ’34, and
Alice Roth, Ed. '35, decorations and
refreshments: and Mildred -Hopkins,

couldliave missed its purpose more
successfully, where at least a. third of
the audience must strain necks to see
the footliglits and the voice of the
most fulmliiatiiig speaker rockets
about the roof or trembles and dis-
solves iii the eleventh row. There is
as much of the true East about it as
a drug store sheik.

Fortunately the Carnegie brown-
stone school of architecture has
made few inroads, though even at

that we have a. consummate example.
Often we have wondered what color
stone lay under the inches of dirt on
the museum. ‘Old men tell of some-
thing fair and pleasant to look at in
the sunlight. Butto us that is sound
and fury, who see only the bastard
outlines, heavy, squat, almost wholly
gloomy. And the park can do little
to _,liclp, spreading across 8. .-l‘,$iVlll0-
that is sooty and cluttered with

, slums.

All of this might be excused on the
score that the buildings are old.
They belong to a period that ante-
dates ours-—-a time of haste, expan-
slon, when a roof meant a roof, and
beauty was realized in adulterated
reproductions of old world art. The
Maso-nic Temple tries hard to look
like a Greek temple on a box; '.he
Pittsburgh Athletic: Association like
a Venetian palace, all facade, with
an incongrous brick addition overhal-
anclng tlie,roof, and only to reinem-

insults the medieval cathedral still

atory, most peculiar, most specialized
element of our machine civllization——-
and we see it growing under our eyes
into a. ponderous imitation of ii. Greek
temple! Perhaps the great columns
are the most massive in the world,
out snugly from stone, and perhaps
they do look ﬁne in the slanting sun-
light; but -they are only surface. non-

functional, mero orna.uients_,_,tii,9u,;;lit-,

fully placed to cut oil’ 'a "large share
of illumination.

On our Cathedral we can look with
more favor. It, at least, realizes
symbolically its intention, a tower of
aspiration, a. modern skyscraper.
Despite its use of gotlilc ornamenta-
tion, it is by far the most impressive
building in the city. But one can not
even be-optiniistic‘ about the interior.
What a. conglomerate bee hive of old
world relics will look like is discour-
aging to thinking upon. For with
all your Dutch Rooms, Greek Rooms.
Germ-an Rooms, accumulated through
forty stories, something sharply re-
sembling a. museum cannot be es-
caped.

Even this building is far from
making the break that would mark
it truly representative of our time.
The things of the old world are ours
only ‘in"“ reispecti‘ to-'how” we‘ "calf ‘use

them to our own ends., Suchuse of ,

them is sidestepping the issue, or, at
most, merely patching it up.

And so we cannot help wishing for
something more truly our own. Right
now it looks rather hopeless. It is
easier to move a block of slums than
to obliterate a. stone heap like the
Mosque for something of real beauty.
But what opportunities in new build-
ing projects remain we hope will
point forward. Even at that, though,
the projected Heinz Memorial Chapel
