 the chemical properties of polymers,
molecules arranged in long chains that can be found
in substances like proteins or plastics She became
interested in polymers after doing her own inde-
pendent research on the subject at Pitt.

Professor Frank Snowden, who directs the
materials research program at the University of
Minnesota, said that Koubaa was one of 15 stu-
dents chosen to attend out of more than 100 ap-
plicants _The University selected her based on her
high GPA, coursework, recommendation letters
and interviews

Snowden said Koubaa is younger than many
of the students in the program, but she is curious
and mature. '

“We’ve got an eclectic group of students, and
she ﬁts inverywell,’ ’ he said. ‘ ‘She’s Very cooperative
and very curious, and she’s got a great personal-
ity.’ ’

Snowden said that, like him, Koubaa went to
college early. He said she demonstrates her intel-
ligence when she asks good questions and persists
with strong follow—ups .

"Those are endearing qualiﬁes, especially for a
scientist A lot of students [her] age you’d expect
to be more into themselves,” he said “But she
is not.”

Snowden said he  thought that Koubaa,
being a Muslim-American, would feel different
from other students in the program, but that is

“\X/hen [I found out about the pageant], I
thought, this is very different, but it ﬁts her per-

this makes me a little different, but what difference
does that make?”

Koubaa will graduate in two years, when
she’s 20. During her senior year of high school at
Gateway Senior  School in Monroeville, she
participated in a program at Pitt that allowed her
to take college classes before she graduated She

Koubaa said that she thinks her involvement on

perform well on the pageant application and will
help herin the competition At Pitt, she’s a member
of  Without Borders She’s also a member
of  for a Sustainable \X/orld,  on
a hydrokinetics project to find new ways to derive
power from rivers.

Koubaa came to Pitt because it was the best
 school close to Monroeville, and she
needai to live at home since she was still in 
school. She said she thinks  early from a

 
 

good schoolwill give her an advantage when look— -

But that’s too far ahead For now, Koubaa is
concentrating on her research and the pageant;
She said she hoped the headscarf won’t affect
what the judges think of her, even though “the
competition is more down—to—earth than 
the next supermod ” _

“I have in the pasthad some trouble with people
[who see the headscarf], but most often when it
is brought up, it’s more curiosity than anything,”
Koubaa said “I love to answer the questions people
have,becauseif theyknowwhatIthink,thenwe
can be more open and more understanding”

Polka still culturally relevant to some Americans

 
   

by Mark Kozlowski

Co/umnziit

 
 

Sing along if you know this one:
“Snikeupthemusic, the bandhas begun,
the Pennsylvania Polka.” Doesn’t that
sound like an awful lot of fun?

Maybe it’s true that my mom tunes
in to the radio everyweek for the polka
shows That’s when I leave the room.
Despite that, I don’t mind polka music
(If that isn’t a tepid endorsement, I don’t
know what is).

Nevertheless, it is  to know
that the National Academy of Record-
ing Arts and Sciences has decided to
discontinue the Grammy Award for Best
Polka Album. The official reason is that
polka is not very popular and, therefore,

not culturally relevant enough to deserve
the exalted miniature phonograph each
year.

On june 4, the Associated Press
mentioned that the Academy sought
tokeeptheawards “pertinentwithin the
current musical landscape,” and polka
no longer ﬁt the bill. Now, I’m sure the
Academy has received angryletters from
polka die-hards of 80 years And I, too,
must object

First, consider the wholesome val-
ues presented by polka music, especially
compared to other forms of music that
shall remain nameless Sufﬁce to say,
sex, drugs and accordions don’t mix.
Polka does not promote violence, dis-
respect toward women, substance 
or— Polish jokes aside -—irresponsible
drinl<ing' For this reason, during 

school my mom allowed me to stay out

as longas Iwanted— provided I blared
polka from the carradio after 11 pm.
\lC/hatever else you say about it, polka
is not 

Second, polka represents a signiﬁ-
cant part of the population. It is the
heritage of German, Czech and Polish
descendants, as well as other immigrants
Granted, many polka songs these days
are in English, and sojourns into the
“mother tongue’ ’ can be hilarious lessons
in bad accents for Polish-Americans.

Contrary to its treatment by the

Grammy committee, polka music" is "

culturally relevant, even if it isn’t relevant
to everybody in the country at the same
time ‘As it is relevant to a  por-
tion of the population, it is an integral
part of American polyglot culture.
Polka is also a form of music that is
not easily incorporated into any other

genre, which cuts off the argument that
polka albums could simply compete in
other categories. Traditional folk? \Well,
sornebodyfs folks listen to it-. But when

I Peter, Paul and Mary release a polka al-
bum, I’ll not only buy that album but —

I’ll also buy the feasibility of polka as
folk music _

There is precedent for the recog-
nition of music genres that are cultur-
ally signiﬁcant _if not widely popular.
On the street, one  does not
hear Beethoven  out of car
subwoofers Similarly, country music is
generally trashed and bluegrass ignored,

yet the Academy still deems all three .

of these genres worthy of Grammy

- recognition. I

Removing this award might make
sense  current economic circum-
stances: No doubt there is a cost to re-

taining an award in a  genre
Given thatjimmy Sturr has won 18 of
the last 24 Grammys in polka, perhaps
someone should investigate how effec-
tive his competition is.

Indeed, this is a secondary argument
used by the Academy. However, that no-
tion is also a bit dishonest. Other polka
bands exist and assuredly release albums
It is simply the opinion of Academy
members who, while complaining that
.Sturrwin'stoooften,givehimtheawards
in the ﬁrst place

Ultimately, those who claim polka
has no cultural signiﬁcance need to get
out of Los Angeles, into the Midwest
and away from  Grammy-
worthiness is directly related to album

sales or hipness.

Sidney Ganis, president of the-
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences, announced earlier this
week that the Oscars would include
10 nominations for Best Picture in-
stead of the usual ﬁve. '

The Academy’s decision affects
individual movie audiences differ—
ently — the average audience will not
take it the same way as the die-hard
cinemaphile. Let me elaborate 

The Average Audience: has a real
job. Most likely saw “Iron Man,”
“\Wall—E” or “Step-Brothers” last
summer. Hasn’t heard of Krzysztof
Kies1owski’s “The Decalogue.”

_ No big deal. Sowhat if they name
10? You still probably won’t even
watch the Oscars. And who could

- blame you?

If “The Dark Knight” was nomi-
nated last year, though, you might
have ﬂipped on the telecast for just
a little bit And, accidently, of course,
you might have learned more about
some unknown ﬁlms you haven’t
heard of.. Maybe you’d have seen

“Synecdoche, NY” or “Revolution- .

ary Road,” but you still wouldn’t have
checked out I-Ierzog’s documentary
about Antarctica.

The Filmmaker: has a real job,
but doesrft call it a job. Spends ex-
tended amounts of time in front of

video screens or camera viewﬁnders.

Might have heard of Kieslowski’s
“The Decalogue.”

You could be a nominee, too!
These days, getting an Oscar nod is
easier than ﬁnding Lindsay Lohan in
a crappy straightvto—DVD ﬂick..

So maybe your little indie ﬂick
starring Billy Baldwin might catch
the recently widened attention of
the Academy, and, as helpful as a

Even in summer, Pitt Arts

offers great theater deals

by Colleen 
Staﬂ Writer

Compared with the ticket sales of last sum-
mer, Pitt Arts has found that its sales have in-
creased by l7 percentthis surnmer—proof that
even in tough economic times, students will still
indulge in their passion for the arts.

Or their passion for discounts.

During the warmer months, Pitt Arts -—- the
program students use to satisfy their artistic
cravings —— does not offer the free museum
visits or free trips to local shows that it offers
throughout the fall and spring semesters.

Still, the organization doesn’t go into total
hibernation. Students can still take part in the
cityfs cultural eventsthrough what PittArts calls
“Cheap Seats.” Buying tickets through Cheap
Seats is away to snag seats to some of the most
sought-after events for a cheaper price than buy-
ing them from the primary organization. _

Litmea Glick, assistant director for Pitt Arts,
said that Cheap Seats gets a lot of involvement,
even in a summer session‘ when the majority
of undergraduate students are not enrolled in
classes

“We don’t have a set amount of tickets, we i

just keep selling until they tell us that the show
is sold out,” Glick explained. “According to
records for the months of Mayandjune, we’re
selling over 600 tickets a month, which means
we’re doing pretty good.”

From July until the end of summer, Pitt
Arts will offer tickets to events that range from
musicals adapted from classic novels to orches-
tIa productions playing translations of classic
rock songs. i

Pittsburgh CLO will present “Les Mis-

érables,” “Barry Manilovi/s Copacabana” and
“Into the Woods,” a Stephen Sondheim musical

' that takes many characters from well-known

fairy tales and places them in a single, complex
narrative 
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra will
also be reaching into the music of the ’70s with
its performance “The Machine — Pink ‘Floyd
Tribute.” Using various instruments, the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra will play. alongside
one of the most well known Pink Floyd tribute
bands, The Machine, to recreate the sounds of a
rock band that has never grown out of style
’ Glick said she thinks this alternative use of an
otherwise traditional orchestra will attract more
students to buy cheap seats to the show:
“It’s a little different for Pittsburgh Sym-
phony, and it deﬁnitely creates a new audience}?

she said. ‘‘\We’ve had people coming up and

 to buy tickets though, sopstudents ar
showing interest” ‘

In addition to the Pink Floyd show, the

Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra  perform
“Video Games Live,” a concert dedicated to
the background sounds of A well-known video
games that should translate well with younger
audiences. ‘
According to Glick, Pitt Arts tends to slow
down during the summer, but by continuing to
use the Cheap Seats program to keep students

- interested in the arts, there is still extra time to

plan for the fall.

“We take a little break until August, which
is what most of the cultural organizations do,”
she explained.

Although Pitt Arts eases up on its activity
once the spring semester ends, student interest
does not dwindle.

two-hour French album into an
English musical set to premiere

in the heart of London’s theater -

district.

Since the show’s opening in
October 1985, the show has trav-
eled to more than 37 countries
and has been seen by more than
56 million people, according to a
news release from the Pittsburgh
CLO. The original Broadway pro-
duction, which opened in March

' .1987, performed a total of 6,680

shows before moving to its cur-

‘ rent home in Queen’s Theater in

London. .
Since then, “Les Miserables”
has collected more than 50 major

theater awards, including eight To- A

nys, a Grammy and a Triple Plati-
num Disc-for the London cast’s

' ‘recording of the show.

Now the touring production
arrives in Pittsburgh this upcom-
ing week and brings with it a man
who has been in Jean Valjean’s
shoes many times. _ V

Fred Inkley has portrayed
Valjean in Broadway and touring

   
   
  
 
  
 

productions of the show since
1993. But even after more than
10 years of performing the same
character, Inkley ﬁnds new as-
pects of Valjean at every perfor-
mance.

“It’s one of those musicals

you can’t help but get swept away

with,” Inkley said.

To truly embody the character,
Inkley has not only diligently stud-
ied the musical’s script, but has
also read Victor Hugo’s original
novel multiple times.

“I knew where my character
had been and where he was go-
ing,” Inkley said. “I create those
goals and ob-stacles through each
scene.” '

Of course, 'Inkley’s personal
life sometimes invades. the char-
acter of iValjean. Since he began
touring with-“Les Miserables,’~’ In-
kley has had two daughters. His

_ oldest daughter is now l4 years

old — thesame age as Cosette,

the abused little girl of “Les Mis-

erables.” '
Inkley’s attitudes toward the

character of Cosette have greatly
evolved during his time with the
tour and his daughter. \X/hile In-
kley’s daughter is similar to Co.-
sette in her innocence, he senses a
unique attitude in both his daugh-

to stay in Pittsburgh speciﬁcally
for ﬂexibility’s sake.

“In Pittsburgh, because I have
to make a living, I get to do all
kinds of‘ things,” Hartman said.

Besides performing in musi-
cals, Hartman has lent his talents
to Shakespeare and plays, sym-
phonies, operas, chi1dren’s theater,
commercials and movies.

“I get to do more than most
actors would get to do,” he said.

In “Les Miserables,” Hartman
portrays Thenardier, a ruthless
gang leader using the revolution
for his_ own means.

When it comes to Thenardier,

‘-‘He’s amoral and finds joy in his
amorality,” Hartman said. A

Hartman just returned from
the Broadway production of “A
Tale of Two Cities,” but feels the
rush of trying to prepare for a
classic in less than a week.

“It’s a little scary because I

spent six weeks rehearsing [“Ai

Tale of Two Cities.”] That’s a lot
of time to let the world and the
music and everything sort of soak

in to you,” Hartman said.

‘‘Here it is, six days. Consid-
ering I’ve never seen the show
and only listened to it a couple of
times, it’s a little scary.”

But Hartman, having per-
formed in countless shows and
productions in the Pittsburgh area,
feels ready for next week’s perfor-
mance and hopes Pittsburghers
will come out in the masses for
the show.

“People are going, to have their
souls fed,” Hartman said.

Souls will not be the only thing
fed by the performances of “Les
Miserables.” The Pittsburgh CLO
will be partnering with the Greater
Pittsburgh Community Food Bank
for a food drive during “Les Mis-

‘erable’s” entire run.

Barrels will be set up in the
lobby of the Benedum Center
during each performance for col-
lecting non—perishable food items.
All theatergoers who donate will
be eligible for a $5 discount to
another CLO show, “8—TRACK,
The Sounds of the ’70s.”

How did the Minnesota Timberwolves fall in

When Dejuan Blair slipped some 20 spots
lower than most people thought he would be
taken in last week’s NBA Draft, many in his
camp and around Pittsburgh were furious.

But not Blair. 5

‘‘It’s a dream come true,” he said in a con-
ference call last week. “I should have been a
first-round pick, but God wanted me to drop

‘to the second round.”

Blair was selected with the seventh pick
in the second round (37th overall) by the San
Antonio Spurs.

Because of the drop, Blair’s contract offer
will be different than if he had been picked in
the first round. First—round picks are guaran-
teed a contract for two seasons, but second-
round picks must make a team before earning
an NBA salary.

If Blair makes the Spurs roster, he could
be offered the league  of $457,588
—- although his agent, Happy Walters, expects
him to make more than that.

Still, Blair has many reasons to feel so
optimistic despite his freefall into the second
round.

Football

Young rnning backs competing for top spot on football team ,

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ Wrzler

 
   

Now that Pitt’s top two running
backs and starting fullback from last
year are gone, the Pitt football team
must decide who will play in the
backﬁeld this season.

Workhorse running back LeSean
McCoy declared for the NFL Draft

-after just two seasons at Pitt, while
LaRod Stephens-Howling and
starting fullback Cohredge Collins
graduated.

Yet, there is no need for Pitt fans
to panic, as the current backﬁeld,
though young and inexperienced,
is stocked with talent.

The three tailbacks competing
for the starting job are true freshman
Dion Lewis, redshirt freshman Chris
Burns and redshirt sophomore Shar-
iff Harris.

While Lewis already started to
separate himself from the rest,
all three look like solid bets to get
touches in game action.

“We have three guys that we will
start training camp with who we
will need to ﬁgure out what roles to
put them in,” running backs coach
David Walker said. “Past years have
shown that we’re going to need at
least three running backs.”

Lewis impressed coaches in the
spring with his raw athletic ability.
He can bench press 365 pounds,

even though he only weighs about
190 pounds, and has quickly grasped
the offense — a feat that is usu-
ally the toughest for freshmen to
achieve.

éé

The biggest thing I took from
being around LeSean is his
competitiveness.

cm as
Burns

Lewis enrolled at Pitt last semes-
ter to get a jumpstart on working

out with the team, and it has helped
him take an early advantage toward
being the starting tailback.

“I was very pleased with Dion’s
progress this spring,” Walker said.

Walker and the coaching staff
have also preached key tasks that
all the backs must continue doing
to see increased game action.

“The coaches tell us to stay
focused and to know our assign-
ments,” Burns said. “If you run a
4.2 [40-yard dash time] but can’t run
your routes and don’t know your as-

signments, then that speed doesn’t

mean mu .”

Meanwhile, redshirt sophomore
Henry Hynoski and redshirt junior
Kevin Collier are battling for the

starting fullback role.

Hynoski, Collier and Harris are
the only Pitt backs with game ex-
perience, combining for 49 rush-
ing yards on 17 carries last seasonfi
Those three are all powerful run-
ners who thrive off  contact,
while Burns and Lewis are quicker
and more elusive runners who are
both less than 6 feet tall and 200’
pounds. - 5

Add highly touted freshman run-
ning back Raymond Graham from
Elizabeth, N.]., who is set to join the
team shortly, and the backfield is
about to get: even more crowded. ,

While McCoy, Stephens-Howling
and Collins’ 1,885 combined 
yards and 26 touchdowns will be

Dixon prepares Gibbs, Team

by Jay Huerbin
Sparta E/(M0/'

As a head coach in the Big East,Jamie Dixon
is used to pressure And when Dixon was named
head coach of the USA Under—19 World Cham-
pionship basketball team, things didn’t get any
easier.

Dixon selected the best 12—man roster, which
includes Pitt sophomore guard Ashton Gibbs,
to compete in the 2009 FIBA Under—19 World
Championship. The tournament, which takes
place in Auckland, New Zealand, begins tomor-
row.

Dixon was promoted to the head coach‘posi—
tion after Davidson coach Bob McKillop, who
coached the Under-18 team last year, decided
to spend more time with his team after Stephen
Curry left early for the NBA Draft ‘

Team USA won three of the ﬁrst four tourna-
ments, but hasn’t taken gold since 1991. Dixon
said he hopes to change that and bring the cham-
pionship title back to the United States.

“We know we haven’t won this tournament
since 1991, and so we’ve made that a goal for
us,” Dixon said. “We understand what we’re

up against”

The team got off to a good start, defeating
Croatia, 97-68, in a tuneup scrimmage on ain
scoring in the game with 15 points.

Dixon said the  that stands out the most
on this team is how each player on the team steps
up at different times,

“The strength of this team is we have 12 play-
ers —— top to bottom,” Dixon said. "That might
be our advantage over some other teams.”

J The United States starts preliminary play
with a game against Iran tomorrow morning.
The team will take on France on Thursday and
Egypt ‘on Friday. Bracket play is scheduled to
begin next Monday. . ‘

  Blair falls to second round,

but confident infuture

Blair, page 15
avoided joining a losing team with a high
pick.

Instead, he goes to a perennial NBA pow-
erhouse, who ﬁnished fourth in the Western
Conference last season and has won three
NBA Championships in the past seven sea-
sons.

Not only that, but Blair will get a chance
to step in and play immediately. The Spurs
frontline is relatively thin behind superstar
forward Tim Duncan with only Matt Bonner
and Drew Gooden averaging more than eight
points per game last season. 9

The Spurs still seek to improve the for-
ward position with a trade last season that
sent Kurt Thomas to the Milwaukee Bucks
for Richard Jefferson.

And this opportunity is a perfect fit for
the young Blair, who ﬁnished his sophomore
year at Pitt last season.

“I couldn’t have landed in a better situa-
tion than I am in now,” he said. “[San Anto-
me] just traded Kurt Thomas, their starting
forward.” .

While Jefferson is a forward, as well, his

game is more suited toward playing on the

perimeter. Jefferson plays primarily small

forward, so he and Blair probably won’t be
competing for playing time at the same po-
sition. J A

With superstar Duncan on the Spurs, Blair
will get to learn from one of the best power
forwards in the league. Duncan has averaged
more than 21 points and 11 rebounds per
game during his 12-year NBA career.

And his level—headed demeanor on the
court is the model for what coaches try
to preach to young players entering the
league.

There is no answer as to why Blair fell
in the Draft, but sportswriters and fans say
his knees won’t be able to hold up over the
course of an NBA career.

But this is just the next wave of skepticism
that Blair has had to overcome. Critics said he
couldn’t play in the post at just 6 feet 7 inches
tall, but he proved them wrong.

Now, Blair seems to be on a mission to
show all the teams that passed on him that
he can still be the kind of player that terror-
ized opponents in the paint during his two
years at Pitt.

As Blair put it, “It’s time to go to work
and show people what they missed.”

to see Young alongwith his other picks — former

(No 27) —— on the court at the same time.

_“W'1th [Young and Carroll’s] athleticism and
with Hasheem’s ability to block shots and rebound
and  shots, we’re  to be able to run more
and not lose as much when we do change our

want to score You can’t win unless you outscore
the other team.” ‘, -

Young said he is conﬁdent he can fit in with
