Crackdown on drinking widespread

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt students, faculty, administrators -— take comfort.
You’re not alone.

Other schools have joined the battle against alcohol abuse
on campus. Other campuses have witnessed police raids of
local bars similar to the one at Zelda's Greenhouse last
month.

Schools in the Midwest, the East coast and across the
country have all begun to be more pro-active in fighting the
abuse of alcohol and it’s consequences.

Two of the most popular bars for college students in the
Washington area were raided by local police last month. The
raids were similar to the Pennsylvania State Police’s raid of
Zelda’s Greenhouse last month, except not nearly as many
minors were caught.

After an undercover investigation, Washington
Metropolitan Police and the Alcohol Beverage Control
Board raided the bars frequented by Georgetown, George
Washington and American University students. At least one

student was arrested for consumption of alcohol by a minor.

The Daily Nebraskan, the student newspaper at the
University of Nebraska —— a campus similar in population to
Pitt’s — recently reported that in a one-year period, police
responded to 790 calls of disturbance at 19 local bars.

“It’s a problem campuses across the country are dealing
with,” said Bob Gallagher, head of the Pitt Counseling
Center. ‘

Pitt formed an alcohol abuse task force almost a year ago,
around the same time Pitt student Atif Bhatti died of alcohol
poisoning. Gallagher said the formation of the task force was
not in response to Bhatti’s death, but instead was in exis-
tence beforehand and “a very serious attempt to combat the
problem.”

The University of Colorado has also taken serious steps to
combat what it considers to be a drinking problem on cam-
pus. It has banned alcohol from all fraternity houses in a
move that was approved by the fraternities.

Some of the ideas Pitt’s alcohol-abuse task force is consid-

ering include an alcohol-free residence in Amos Hall and

Groups
to pay
more for

By Danielle Shuster
Staff Writer

Student organizations who
use the William Pitt Union
for fundraising dances are
facing a new challenge -
paying for three police offi-
cers to patrol.

In the past only two offi-
cers were required to patrol
at each ‘dance. The addition
of the third may be a- finan-
cial burden on student
groups, since they have to ,
pay for the police. Each offi-
cer is paid $28.65 per hour,

“It’s going to force organi-

The new William Pitt

not affect all student groups

impact of studying abroad painted vivid pic-

for International Studies (UCIS) board of vis-
itors-meeting.

The board of visitors is an external group
appointed by the chancellor and provost
which is charged on a_ yearly basis to assess
specific university programs. Every center at
Pitt is required by the university’s charter to
have a board of visitors which has direct bud-

q getary responsibility.

Last year was the first time students actual-
ly sat in on the board of visitors meeting, and
it was by the board’s request that they were
invited again.

“They can hear us talk all day about these
programs, but they want to hear it first-hand
from the students,” said Tom McKechnie.

“Through Semester At Sea. I learned that
education is not just a passive thing.“ said
Pitt junior Damon Hill. “It allowed me to
apply classroom knowledge to life. which no
book could have ever conveyed.”

Students talked about being enriched in
another culture.as a transformational experi-
ence. They said they didn’t realize the direct
impact of this opportunity until they came
back and saw themselves moving in a direc-
tion they hadn’t anticipated.

Senior Diwana Chapman talked about the
confidence she gained as well as the first-
hand experiences she had while on the
Nantes/Paris program.

Serbs attack refugee camp, killing six

N
E; World Events

SARAJEVO — Two days
before a cease—fire was to take
effect. Bosnian Serbs attacked a
refugee camp for Bosnian
Muslims, killing six civilians and
wounding at least 30 others.

Serbian aircraft also bombed
the village of Tesanjka, in north
central Bosnia, killing two and
wounding more than 50.

In response to the attacks,
NATO ordered air strikes against
Serbian artillery positions, but
said they had been called off
because of bad weather.

In the past week, Bosnian Serb ”

jets have pounded Bosnian gov-
ernment positions as both sides

The latest Israeli-Palestinian
agreement got off to a slow start
yesterday when imprisoned
Palestinian women refused to
accept a government pardon, say-
ing that Israel reneged on a pledge
to free all female prisoners.

The original plan wasto release
21 women in what was to be the
start of a three-stage prisoner
release. In the end, one woman,
18-year-old Bashayer Abu Laban,

walked out a free woman, and
only because she had been in iso-

FRANKFURT — A breaking
Belgian military-contracting scan-
dal is threatening to take down
NATO’S Secretary General,
\V1lly Claes, just as the organiza-
tion faces the largest military
operation in its history.

Claes, a key player in the
West’s strict policy towards
Bosnia, is suspected of actions
involving payoffs to Belgian
political parties by the Italian heli-
copter manufacturer Agusta, SPA.

The company allegedly paid
almost $1.7 million in bribes to
Claes’ Flemish socialist party in
1988 in exchange for a $330 mil-
lion contract for 48 helicopters.
Claes was the economic affairs
minister at the time and signed
the contract The New York Times

C. __;l Across the Nation

LOS ANGELES — Almost two
months after the North American
Free Trade Agreement took effect
with projections that it would cre-
ate more than a hundred thousand
jobs, many of its critics are saying
that the United States is paying
dearly.

A large manufacturer of com-
puter keyboards, Key Tronic
Corporation. is one example of its
failure. It has laid off 277 workers
and moved its plant to Mexico,

where wages are a fourth of what
they are in Washington, the cor-
poration’s original location. The

NEW YORK — Rudolph
Franklin Crew accepted the chan-
cellorship of New York City's
public schools, challenging New
Yorkers to join his effort to
improve education that he has
likened to the civil rights struggle.

Crew, voted in 5-2 by the city’s
Board of Education, said that he
would begin by reviewing the job
description of every administrator
at the board’s downtown office
and reassign anyone not directly
involved in improving teaching

BURBANK — The Walt Disney
Company announced that it will
begin granting health coverage to
the live—in partners of gay and les-

that Disney feels will prompt
other companies to follow its

The new policy is similar to
those adopted by Universal,
Paramount Pictures, Sony and
Warner Brothers, all of which
introduced the policy in the past
three years.

Under the policy, a Disney
employee must sign an affidavit
that says he or she is living
with the partner who will receive
the coverage. The New York

Opinions
Under a microscope

Oh no, not politicians and campaigning already! The elec-
tions are 13 months away, for Pete’s sake! V

Ha! You may have thought the time frame might have given
us a temporary period of relief from the ranting and raving of
the candidates, the mud-slinging back and forth, the postur-
mg. the ‘‘I care more than he (or she) does” appeals and the
pre-empting of your “Friends” for some damn debate.

But no, the campaigns for next year’s national elections
have already begun and will be at full tilt in only a couple of
months. The commercials have already started to invade
prime time: Bill Clinton sitting on his desk delivering his
version of the “I care” speech, and Bob Dole looking repen-
tant and reformed about his failure to sign a “no new taxes”
contract in 1988. Clinton and Dole have already begun the
partisan bashing you might not expect until at least after the
primaries have been held.

Both political parties have already made it clear who the
front runners are, and even those who haven’t decided which
party they want to be in (as well as. those who choose not to
run on a party line) are getting involved in the circus.

Probably everyone knows most of the key players in The
Big One — Clinton, Gramm, Dole, Buchanan, Specter,
Keyes, Alexander, Dornan, Powell. Of course, this list is

hardly exhaustive, nor is it final. You can guarantee more

names will find their way onto the list before next November
(please, Mr. Perot, spare us this time!), and you can also bet
some of them will disappear before the primaries.

But it might be a good thing that all these people have
begun to invade the air waves with their messages, promises,
silliness and garbage. This provides all of us with an excel-
lent opportunity to inform ourselves about what is really

g going on in the race to run our country. Whoever actually

wins the upcoming race is going to have to deal with some
huge issues, and it is our responsibility (as voters) to choose
the most qualified person to do the job.

The point is, take the opportunity to learn what these peo-
ple are all about. All these candidates have put themselves on
the examination table in plenty of time for a complete dissec-
tion of their lives and beliefs. You can guarantee that the
mainstream media will take advantage of that and probe into
the recesses of the candidates’ very souls. (Of course, this
does not mean to take everything you hear on the news or in
the tabloids strictly at face value, but it will give you a place
to start.) .

It really doesn’t matter what particular party (if any) a spe-
cific person represents; what is important is what each person
stands for. You can vote for anyone you.want to, regardless
of what party you are registered under. The important part is
to use your voting power in an educated, informed way. Since
the candidates have chosen to plague us with their presence
this early in the game, we all have the ability and responsibil-
ity to learn abouteverything we can about them before giving
one of them the power to run our country.

Some justice has not been served

Marianne Y“’?d‘°‘
 IS 1n 
or is it? O.J.

Simpson was proven not guilty
of two counts of murder on last
Tuesday in Los Angeles. Most
of the country, whether they
agree or disagree, has one thing
in common — relief. However,
for two families in this country,
there is no relief. The Brown and
Goldman families left the L.A.
courtroom on Tuesday dis-
traught that their beloved family
members’ killer still walks free.
Relying on the verdict given
by 12 peers, O.J. is a free man.
However, the L.A. district attor-

' ney to choosing not to look for a

new killer. Because O.J. is not
guilty and they have not looked
and have decided not to look for
another suspect, there are many
unanswered questions. Who was
the killer? How many killers
were there? Why were Nicole
and Ronald killed? Who was the
man with O.J.’s build who the
limo driver saw? Who had a
motive? Was O.J. involved?
Does O.J. know who did it?

Over the weekend, I heard a
very interesting theory. One
which, I believe, should consti-
tute reopening the case instead
of letting a crime go unsolved. I
will not take credit for this idea
(it was my uncle’s), and I will
not even go so far as to say I
believe it, but it is something to
think about.

-Many of the people watching
the trial believe that if O.J. did
not commit this double homicide
he probably knows who did. Of
course, why then did he not let
his secret be known? What if it
was someone he knew? He
would never take the stand. If he
did take the stand, he might let
the secret slip out.

The prosecution’s video reen-
actment of the crime showed
that a man of O.J. Simpson’s
build could have committed the
murders. So there is a large pos-
sibility that someone with O.J.’s
build was involved. What about
all the athletic feats which had to

be performed in order to commit
the murders and ﬂee the scene?
It would have taken a person in
good physical condition to do
the jumping, running and hur-
dling that was required. The
defense contended that the per-
son the limo driver saw, and who
Kato heard, could not have been
O.J. I) O.J. was sleeping in the
house. 2) Whomever Kato heard
obviously did not know the
Simpson estate well enough not
to run into things in the dark.

The prosecution also contend-
ed that the killer wore the gloves
placed into evidence. So again
the killer must have had the
same size hands as O.J.’s (minus
the arthritis). The killer also had
the same size foot as O.J. This,
of course, is not the only evi-
dence. However, OLJ. is not the
only man in the United States
who has big hands and feet
(“big” being relative).

Unfortunately, we are not sure
how much of this evidence, if
any, was planted. We do know
that Nicole Brown Simpson’s
and Ronald Goldman’s killer
walks free. But by putting
together all the evidence and
excluding O.J., we should at the
very least have something to go
on. Who would have approxi-
mately the same build, hand
size, foot size and possibly the
same blood type as O.J.
Simpson? Who would O.J. pro-
tect? Who had a reason to kill
Nicole and Ronald? Who had
the athletic ability?

Although until my uncle sug-
gested it, I personally never
heard anyone else suggest it,
could it have possibly been
O.J.’s oldest son? Why? Was
that dear old dad telling his son
that he will take care of every-
thing? Who was one of the most
emotional people on the
defense’s side during the trial,
especially during the verdict? He
certainly comes very close to the
description of the killer. He
might even have the same kind
of gloves. .

Why would Jason Simpson
kill Nicole and Ronald? Well, it

could have been for his dad.
Maybe, he and Nicole or Ronald
could have been in an argument.
He might have been trying to
protect his father from a possibly
painful potential relationship
between Nicole and Ronald.
Whether any of this is possible is
not for me to determine. But
why hasn’t anyone else (the
LAPD) looked into it?

The purpose of this article is
not to accuse Jason Simpson. It
may have been a “mob hit” or a
“set up.” I’m not in Los Angeles
and I do not know. or care, who
committed the crime. In fact, I
tried to avoid watching the trial
altogether. However, while
watching or reading the news at
anytime within the last 16
months, it was impossible to
avoid catching information
about the trial. I do not know all
the facts. That’s why I’m only

» making a suggestion. However, I

believe that since O.J. was
proven not guilty, it is senseless
to continue to accuse him of
committing these murders.

We, as Americans, should
have a little more faith in our
own system. Right or wrong, 12
average American citizens found
O.J. not guilty. The United
States legal system may not
always work, but this is how it
is. “Innocent until proven guilty
in a court of law.” O.J. was
proven not guilty, which means
that he can never be proven
guilty. But, there is still a crime
to be solved. So if my uncle here
in Pennsylvania could come up
with a possible suspect, the
LAPD should be able to get off
its collective ass and find some
suspects too. Maybe, after at
least another six months of
investigation, they could close
this case. Until then, Nicole and
Ronald will have had no justice.

Marianne Graham would like it
known that she was pressured
into writing an article about 0.J.

(Editor's Note: Said pressure
was not applied by The Pitt
News.)

The Pitt News, Tuesday, October 10, 1995

Voicing their opinions...

Only one word can accurately
describe the verdict of the O.J.
Simpson trial: unbelievable! This
case is an absolute travesty of
our judicial system by turning a
violent murder case into an
entertainment extravaganza.
How much money, exposure and
job enhancement (Kato Kaelin
radio show) could be gained by
riding on the coat tails of vio-
lence. Where is the integrity, or
does the meaning of that word
even exist anymore when cutting

. through the scandals, lies and

charades which have surrounded
the murder trial?

To remind everyone, this is a
case about the abrupt ending of
two lives: Nicole Brown
Simpson’s and Ronald
Goldman’s. These two individu-
als will never be able to tell their
halves of the story, and their
legacies will be lived on by the
gory pictures of their slaughtered
bodies. But this is not the only
tragedy. Nicole Brown Simpson
is survived by two young, inno-
cent children, whose -pictures
have been splattered on every
tabloid, magazine, newspaper
and TV program throughout the
nation.

However, this is not even what
is most disturbing. The O.J.
Simpson trial deals with more
than just O.J.; it deals with
domestic violence. “This is a
gross injustice to America,”
Stephanie Sudzina, Campus

Women’s Organization member,
said, “He’s getting away with
murder!” This is an example of
domestic violence not taken seri-
ously. And as a result, two peo-
ple are dead. Not only are the
Simpson children left mother-
less, victimized and scarred for
life; millions of victims of
spousal abuse are left with less
faith in our judicial system, and
less hope for escape. Nicole
Brown Simpson was quoted say-
ing, “I’m surprised he hasn’t
killed me already.” Not only did
Nicole foreshadow her death,
she left her mark as a prisoner.

O.J. was granted freedom not
by the evidence but by the work
of his impeccable defense team.
As a decided innocent man, 0].
may even come out of this trial
benefitting, courtesy of books
and possible movie deals.
Question: Is this indicative of
our capitalist society which dis-
tastefully exploits human tragedy
in order to gain a buck?

In conclusion, O.J. Simpson
was found to be an innocent
man, but does that mean he is a
good man, a respected citizen 
is he still the Juice; or are you
willing to recognize and accept
another, more tainted side of O.J.
as a violent abusive husband
who had victimized his wife,
Nicole, to the point were she was
living her life out of fear and cry-
ing for help? Or is this, too,
planted evidence? People must

remember the victims and their
families who must heal, forgive
and ﬁnd peace.

Now that the O.J. Simpson
murder trial is over, one resound-
ing observation can be made,
which is the amount of power
and influence that money and
fame possess.

Leslie Albanese and Amy
Sitnick, CWO co-presidents,
and CWO members

O.J. found innocent??!! How
can this be? There seemed to be
so much “evidence” against him.

...Basically, most scientists
approach investigative research
by beginning with models,
hypotheses and predetermined
variables, and then attempting to
support their hypotheses based
on their analysis of collected
data. When we approach
research with our biases intact,
our biases will inevitably filter
the way we collect analyze data
and draw conclusions.

Is this not precisely what hap-
pened in the O..J. trial? I, for
one, was stunned by the verdict.

Why? Because I had several.

biases against O.J. (based mainly
on the fact that he physically
abused his wife - I am intensely
opposed to any form of physical
violence). Therefore, I looked at
the “evidence” with bias-tinted
glasses. O.J. was guilty not
because of the facts, but because
of my biased perception of them.

There is a saying that if you look
for something hard enough,
eventually you will ﬁnd it, even
if it doesn’t exist.

...It is impossible to complete-
ly factor out the element of bias
in anything we do or say. Still we
should at least recognize and
admit our own biases, and be
willing to consider the possibility
that there is another way of look-
ing at things, and yes, dare I say
it, there is the possibility that you
or I could be dead wrong.

The moral of the story: Do not
be so certain that what you think
is so, is actually so.

This past Saturday I was privi-
leged to participate in and
observe an extraordinaiy day in
the life of this campus. The
Pittsburgh Project, a Student
Government Board initiative to
demonstrate the university’s
commitment to community ser-
vice and to promote positive
relations between the campus
and the city, was successfully
launched. When this prioject was
first conceived, the SGB
Community Relations
Committee, the project sponsor,
was hoping to involve a couple
hundred students, faculty and
staff. Instead there were approxi-
mately 500 participants, who
were overwhelmingly students.

They fanned out into the com-
munity, doing a variety of ser-
vice projects.

Somehow, I was drawn to one
particular site. It was Miryam’s
— a shelter for homeless
women, many of whom have
mental problems — which is
located at Epiphany Church near
the Civic Arena. At this site,
about a dozen Pitt students and
staff were raking leaves, clean-
ing windows and screens and
painting the entrance doorway in
an energetic display of unselﬁsh
service. It was Saturday and
these students and staff, and all
the other ones, could have cho-
sen to sleep in or play frisbee on
the lawn. Instead, they respond-
ed to another call.

After spending a couple hours
at Miryam’s, I left, and on my
way home via Liberty Ave. in
Bloomfield I encountered yet
another group of Pitt students
who were spending their
Saturday canning for the Make a
Wish Foundation, a local charity
which helps very sick and some-
times terminally ill children to
realize their special dreams.

It was unquestionably a day
for me of immense pride in Pitt
students, and I want to commend
them for displaying the best of
Pitt character and for their chari-
table acts of caring for others.

introouces  ;

THE PANTHER‘ -

Once upon a Saturday dreary, while Majors pondered, bleak and weary,
Over many a serious and infurious volume of injuries galore—

While he nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a zapping

As of some one viciously snapping, snapping at his nmners galore.
“Tis some defender,” he muttered, “snapping at my runners galore—

Broken legs and nothing more.”

Ah, distinctly he remembers it was in the bleak October,

As each desperate injured player gasped for breath on the turf ﬂoor.
Eagerly he wished for morrow;——vainly had he sought to borrow
From players past surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the runners galore—
For the comer who gives up big pass plays, should have let him score—

Wrnless here for everrnore.

And the super sad uncertain bustling of each blue-and-gold fan
Upset him—ﬁlled him with horriﬁc rumors never heard before;

So that now, to still the beating of his heart, fans stood repeating:
‘“Tis a new coach entreating entrance at the locker room door——
Some no-holds—barred coach entreating entrance at the locker door,

Draws and reverses nevermore.”

Quickly Majors’ soul grew more sad; hesitating then grew more mad,
“Fans,” said he, “or students, truly your forgiveness I implore;

But the fact is you know zero, these players should be your heroes,
And so roughly you came smacking, smacking at Pitt’s locker door,
That I kept the QB in——even though he should stay inside the door;——
. Interceptions here and nothing more.

Deep into the defense peering, long John stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, throwing balls no mortals ever dared to throw before;

But the balls were intercepted, and the offense can’t correct it,

And the only word there spoken were the words, ‘Turnovers more!”
This John whispered, and fans shouted, “We want Darnell for sure!”

Time for change and nothing more.

Back into the defense churning, all the comers yeam for burning,
Soon again Majors heard a snapping something louder than before.
“Surely,” said he, “surely Mosley’s ﬁnger did not crack just;

Let me see, then, who goes in, and this mystery we’ll explore-

Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery we’ll explore;—

Poor backups and nothing more.”

Here he ﬂung the depth chart, when, in pulled the training cart,

On there lifeless lay the Panthers who promised visions of grandeur.
Not the least adjustments made he; not a player stepped up for he,

But, the Panthers kept on playing, trying to earn the team a score—
Trying upon a bust of Darmy just above Pitt’s locker door——

 Trying, that’s it, and nothing more.

Then this Panther team beguiled Majors’ happy fancy into sadness,

By the grave and shattered decomm of the team he bore,

“Though the head be slick and shaven, you,” he said, “art sure no maven,
Ghastly grim and blocking haven wandering your rank in punting lore-
Tell Johnny why thy punts are blocked on Pitt’s turf-like ﬂoor!”

. Quoth the shaven, “Nevennore.”

But the Panthers, sitting lonely on the bottom, spoke only
That one word, the word ‘bowl’ in that word did he now deplore,
Nothing further did he utter; then his body began to shutter—
Till he scarcely was heard to mutter: “Other coaches have won before-
My players practice to deceive unlike players I’ve coached before,

a Weedeater Bowl bid nevennore.”

Startled at the conﬁdence broken by reply so aptly spoken
“Nonsense,” say the Panthers,” what he utters is rotten to the core,
Victory from some unhappy team will ﬁll his face with vim and gleam

" Then the Temple Owls will cry for days of forgotten lore-

Trll the dirges of Johnny’s hope that a losing team can bore
three wins and nothing more.

Much Johnny marvelled this ungainly team to hear talk so brash,
Their comments have little meaning—fans have heard all this before;
For they cannot help agreeing that no other human being

Ever yet was cursed with such injuries galore at Pitt’s locker door-

improve to
4-2 in Big

The Pitt soccer team won
its second consecutive Big
East game Sunday when it
defeated Syracuse 2-1. The
win improved Pitt’s record to

overall.

Aftercoming off a huge
Big East win against No. 8
St. John’s, the Pitt soccer
team arrived in Syracuse’s
Carrier Dome prepared to
keep their winning streak
alive. Before a crowd of 739
people, that’s exactly what
the Panthers did.

The Panthers’ attack start-
ed immediately.

Four minutes was all Pitt
needed to draw first blood.
At 4:02, Pitt freshman for-
ward Drew Kopp scored the
first goal of the contest. The
goal was set up by Phil
Matilla heading the ball into
the goal area. Kopp took
advantage of the free ball
and put it where it belonged

Drew Kopp scored Pitt's first goal, en route to a 2-1 victory.

—— in the net.

For the next 50 minutes of
play, the game went back
and forth without a goal.

“We had three or four great
chances,” Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “Their
goalkeeper made some great
saves.”

Syracuse goalie Josh
McGibbon had his work cut
out for him, as the Panthers
posted six shots on goal. Pitt
emerged as an offensive
threat with shots coming
from a variety of players.
Kopp had a solid game, reg-
istering four shots, including
the goal. Jeff Porter, Jason
Piombino and Travis Kruse
all had two shots each.

“We have a lot of different
guys contributing. Everyone
is doing their ' part,”
Luxbacher said.

With half of the game
remaining, it was far from
over

The momentum of the
game switched over to
Syracuse when Matt
Yakubisin scored off a short
corner kick to tie the game.
The play surprised the Pitt
players. Luxbacher said it’s
unusual for a team to pass on
a short corner kick, and
that’s what Syracuse did.

The surprised Panthers
allowed Syracuse to dribble

Men's X-country takes second

Coach Sobal hands

out poor grades to
women's squad

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

Two weeks ago, Pitt cross country coach
Dave Sobal looked ahead to last Saturday’s
meet at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio,
and called it Pitt’s first test of the season.
The grades are in, and in some cases, they
are less than stellar.

women. Stacey Anderson finished 13th at
19:08, 1:01 behind Debbie Brown of Ohio,
who won the race. Normally, that’s not bad
in a large race, but Sobal was not impressed.

“That was a sub-par performance for
Stacey Anderson. She had a slight injury
that she was dealing with, and I don’t know
if that was the reason or not, but Stacey did
not have a great race,” Sobal said.

Actually, the best time of the weekend for
Pitt came from a runner who didn't even
make the trip to Ohio. Only the top seven
men and the top seven women ran at Ohio;
the rest stayed home for the Duquesne
Invitational at Schenley Park. Pitt’s Angie
Martin was unable to make the trip, so she
ran at home last weekend. Martin made up
for not being able to travel by winning her
race in 18:41.

impressed Sobal more than
it impressed his runners.

“They’re not as strong as
they have been, but they’re
still :1 good distance running
school.“ Sobal said. “It
meant a lot to me after liv-
ing in Virginia for 18 years
to beat Virginia Tech. But
the men were more con-
cerned about Ohio.”

Ohio University ran away
with the meet with 26
points. Pitt finished second
with 83. Sobal wasn’t as
concerned as his runners
about Ohio’s large margin
of victory. He was pleased
with what Pitt did against
the teams that finished
behind them.

“With about a half mile to i

go. we were in fourth
place.“ Sobal said. “I think
most of the guys can think
back to that last half mile
and see the things that made
the difference."

Pitt's strength was
definitely in the last half
of the race. At the three-
mile mark, Dennis Kuntz,
iulio Ortiz and Ed
Adamson were in 26th. 23rd
and 28th places respective-
ly. They finished in 12th.
15th and 16th. Frank
Nesko finished seventh,
and Matt Samuel finished
33rd to complete Pitt’s top
five.

Sobal was particularly
pleased with Adamson’s
race.

“He needed some recov-
ery time from his injury,”
Sobal said. “Our goal was
to have him back at 100
percent for that race, and he
pulled through for us.”

The men at the Duquesne
Invitational didn’t have so
much success. Rich Walsh
was the top Pitt runner.
Walsh finished 18th in
28:04. The team came in
seventh place with 200
points. Dayton won the
meet with 34.

goal. ' Pitt goalie Adam
Spitzer made the initial
save, but the ball ‘got away
from him and Yakubisin was
there to put it in for
Syracuse.

“We learned a lesson,”
Luxbacher said of the
Syracuse goal. “You have to
work on everything.”

As the clock ticked away
valuable minutes, the game
remained a 1-1 tie. Both
teams were desperately
clinging onto the hope that
they’d score the game—win-
ning goal. At 83:03, that
goal was scored by Pitt
senior J.L. Gorsin.

“Drew [Kopp] got the ball
in the flank and slid it
across the goal,” Luxbacher
said.

The rest was done by
Gorsin, who knocked the
pass in to give Pitt a 2-1
lead.

For the last seven minutes
of the game, Pitt’s defense
stood its ground and pre-
vented the Orangemen from
tying the game.

“The game was on the
line. We took control,”
Luxbacher said. “Syracuse
is a good team, but our guys
deserved to win.”

Luxbacher said Pitt played
a strong defensive game that
contributed to the win.

“We didn’t give up a lot of

  ' ' ' _ ' shots,” Luxbacher said. ‘‘It
'  — was a good, solid perfor-
-_ ‘ mance.”

, T The Panthers will now

prepare for what appears to
be their biggest challenge so

far. This Friday, Pitt faces

' Rutgers, which is on top of

. the Big East and No. 3 in
. the nation.

“Rutgers is solid every-
where. They’re a strong,

veteran team,” Luxbacher
14 1 said. “It’ll be a big, big
C . 9 challenge.”
