Law and order. V
Many people in this coun
have questioned our justice sys-
tem wondering if it really works.

Former Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates and the cur-
rent President of the American

Civil Liberties Union Nadine‘

Strossen will debate the issue of
law and order in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room. tonight
at 8:30. ‘

Many students are in opposi-
tion of the debate, sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council, focus-
ing in on the fact that Gates will
be one of the debaters.

Gates is notorious for being
the head of the Los Angeles
Police Department during the
Rodney King beating and the
riots that occurred last May

Let me just emphasize that We Were approachedwith the
opportunity to have Daryl Gates here alone. When [the PPC,
Committee] was approached with a debate representing
both sides, then We said yes.

when the accused officers were
acquitted.

Flyers posted around campus
are calling for awareness to the
issue that “a bigot” (Gates) is
being brought in to debate on
law and order.

The flyer states that bringing
in Gates to speak symbolizes
many things to the black com-
munity, including “continuing
injustice to people of African
decent (sic),” and “lack of

respect for people of African

decent (sic).” The‘ ﬂyer also
states that bringing in Gates is

e“blatant racism personified by

this institution of ‘higher educa- ‘

tion,”’ and to “join the BAS
(Black Action Society) outside
the Towers lobby at 7:20 p.m.”
A BAS member, who wished
to remain anonymous, said that
the ﬂyer was a collective idea of

BAS and that BAS would remain"

in the Towers lobby tonight

‘debate. . -

The ﬂyers, not approved by
the WPU building management
office, were removed from the
entrance ways of the building. 9

Pitt students helped themselves out of
their jeans yesterday while at the same time
helping the needy into them.

Pitt Program Council and Levi Strauss and
Co. sponsored their L'evi’s 501 Amnesty
Day yesterday on the William Pitt Union
patio as a way to help out the needy in the
community.

Suzanne Kline, spokesperson for Levi
Strauss and Co., said that 151 pairs of jeans
were donated.

“[It is] just in time for the cold weather
coming up,” she said.

According to Christina Bell, a member of

the PPC Special Events Committee, the

turn-out was commendable even though it
was an ugly day. ' '

jeans were students, but P-itt faculty and

staff members also came to donateold

pairsdof jeans, Kline said.

Pitt student Kelly Kubant was one of the
students donating jeans. “I saw this going
on, and I told my roommate to. grab a pair
because it’s for a good cause,” she said.

She also said that it would be nice if
even more people donated jeans for the
needy.

PPC Assistant Director "of Student

Activities Torn» Misuraca said the jeans are A

not resold to anyone but are given to a
local charity in the area.

Kline said that the jeans will be going to
the United Way Children and Youth and
Clothing Closet.

“This has definitelybeena success,”
Kline said.

“They have their right to voice

Assistant Director of Student

right to their opinions. “It’s their
right to protest. The First
Amendment works‘ for every-

Misuraca said that a lot of

fact that Daryl Gates is coming

Misuraca, students "who call

Presby transplant patient,
Fourstar, reported stable

By‘ Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Charlie Fourstar, a ,four—year-
old Native—American girl, is in
stable but serious condition
following a multi-organ trans-

plant performed on her last_

week. _

Fourstar received a five-
organ transplant ’ at
Presbyterian University
Hospital in a 16—hour.opera-
tion. . ’

“She is able to sit up in a
chair and her spirits are much

" better than they have been,”

University" of Pittsburgh
Medical Center spokesperson
Susan Manko said.

Fourstar is in intensive care

at Presbyterian Hospital.
Doctors say her organs. are
functioning well, and she may
remain in ICU up to a month,
according to Manko.

Fourstar was born with short
gut syndrome and has lived

, most of her life in a hospital

setting on a, Sioux Indian
reservation in Poplar,
Montana. A short gut (or intes-
tine) does not have enough
surface area to adequately
absorb nutrients from ingested
food. The only way Fourstar
has been able to receive nutri-
tion has been intravenously.

As with many cases of
extended intravenous feeding,
liver failure resulted.

European Community is
at its developmental crux

By Brett Gilman
Perspectwe Editor

The European Community, and
the member states of which it is
comprised, is at a time
in its history where it
faces both promise
and uncertainty,
according to dignitaries
speaking in Forbes
Quad yesterday.

Misunderstood by
many of those whom it effects,
the future of the Community rests
on-many factors: historical, eco-
nomic and democratic ones.

The Western European Studies
Program, directed by Associate
Political Science Professor "Alberta
Sbragia, a-specialist on European
Community affairs, hosteda semi-
nar to mark the United Kingdom
presidency of the European

 

Community and address many of
the issues concerning both the

Community itself and the relations »

it has with the external world.
Alister Hunter of the Consul
General of New York
made the opening
remarks. The focus _of his
speech centered on what
he called the three hum’-
canes which hit the’
Community this year.
The hurricanes which he
spoke of were considered not
only because of the implications

A involved for- the Community but

also because they were misunder-
stood by much of the media,
which painted the destruction of
these hurricanes as being final
blows to an ideal.

On the contrary, according to
Sbragia, ‘since the fomiation of the

Richard Rose tells it like he

you call him a rascal,” he said.

He doesn’t sound like a philo-
sophical thinker. Maybe it is
because of his background. He

truth in life. A

truth began at age 12 when he ‘

left the monastery because he

formers,” Poland said.

Burns, a graduate of Chatham
College and life-long resident of
Pittsburgh, deﬁned herself as an
Installation Artist.

“Installation Art is more theoret-
ically based, and oftentimes it
combines different mediums and
is site—speciﬁc,” Burns said.

Burns titled her work
“Oblation,” which she explained it

i to be “deﬁned as a religious offer-

ing ... but I am changing the
meaning to debunk Judeo-
Christian myths, especially with
Sodom.”

Burns stated that her main goal,
not only of the lecture but also of

‘ her artwork, is “trying to educate

know any more than he did.

He worked several jobs and
moved often, continuing his
search for truth. “I spent my
entire life. going to libraries. 1
was struggling along, searching
for definition. I looked and
looked and looked and didn’t
ﬁnd anything,” Rose said.

Things changed in 1947. While
living in the back room of a

‘Chinese restaurant in Seattle, he
had an out-of-body experience.

“It was so real, this place was ﬁc-
tion,” Rose said. “I discovered

consciousness.” F

Since that moment of Satori, or
enlightenment, he has seen the

John Champagne, who is origi-
nally from Milwaukee and cur-
rently working toward a doctorate

» in critical and cultural studies,

spoke of the difficulty of bisexual,
gay and lesbian authors to not
only get published but also to get
publicity.

According to Champagne, there
are not many institutions which
foster the development of bisexu-
al, gay and lesbian authors in
today’s society.

“Out in Print,” a former Hillman

writers, did not even Contact or

‘Don't Panic’ not just a

Is your heart pounding? Are
you sweating and short of
-breath? Do you faint or trem-
ble? Do you have the fear of
losing control, dying or going

insane?

It may not mid-terms. It

may be a panic attack.

Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic is testing a new
drug to help treat individuals
who suffer from panic disor-

der.

“People with panic disorder
may begin to change their
lifestyle,” Dr. Duncan Clark,
an assistant psychiatry profes-
sor said. “They may begin to
avoid public places for fear
that an attack may occur.”

Panic disorders are marked
by frequent — at least four in
a four-week time span —

panic attacks. The symptoms

of a panic attack may include

Trans plant

Continued from page 1

Fourstar was brought to
UPMC to undergo a liver and
sn1'_r_’_‘ intestine transplant.
Doctors were prepared to per-
form additional organ trans-
plants if other gastrointestinal
organs were also damaged or
failing.

Following medical examina-
tions of Fourstar, UPMC sur-
geons decided to also replace
her large intestine, stomach
and pancreas.

This is the fourth operation
of its type performed since the
introduction of the immuno-

suppressant (anti-rejection)

drug FK506.

“FK506 has made it possible
to successfully transplant the
small intestine —- the organ
that had defied success in our
previous multi-organ trans-
plant attempts,” Associate
Professor of surgery and trans-
plant team member Satoru

‘ Todo said. *

FK506 is an experimental
drug isolated from a soil fun-

gus sample in 1984. Clinical

trials of the drug began at Pitt
in 1989. So far, over 2,000
organ transplant patients at
UPMC have been treated with
FK506. Research indicates that
FK506 is 50 to 100 times more

effective than the standard
treatment, cyclosporine.

.Fourstar is the first child to
receive a multi-organ trans-
plant while being treated with
FK506. 9

Before the use of FKSO6,
four previous multi-organ

transplants (on children in

1983, 1987 and 1988 and on
an adult in 1989) failed.

Last October, using FK506,
surgeons performed a multi-
organ transplant on a 32-year-
old man. He is well over a
year later.

Two other adults who
underwent multi-organ trans-
plants in May and August are
recovering at Presbyterian
University Hospital.

Associate Professor of
surgery at the UPMC Andreas

Tzakis evaluated Fourstar over .

six months ago, but she was
unable to get approval of
Medicaid funding to pay for
theoperation. Buena Vista
Television (a Walt Disney
Company) took an interest in
her as part of a pilot for a
television program called “The
Crusaders.” The program
identifies problems and
attempts to solve them. It is
scheduled for syndication in
1993.

the grounds for a common

The narrow “No” vote was
seen as a major blow, and it
triggered an economic and
political crisis throughout the

implementation of the treaty
requires unanimity on the part

the fact that Denmark “did not

citizens had concerns about
what it meant to them. The
concerns of the Danish people
were primarily -with the com-

the recent turmoil in the

result of Britain pulling out of

insistence on maintaining high
interest rates to finance the

Hunter, however, said that it is

“Obviously, such a confining
lifestyle can cause much distress
and interfere with social activi-
ties,” Clark said. “For instance, a
person may be afraid to get into
an elevator because they fear
they’ll be trapped inside when
the attack occurs.”

The new drug, Moclobemide,
will be tested for the first time in
the United States even though it
is now available in Europe.
Moclobemide is an anti-depres-

' sant but shows promise because

it may have fewer. side effects
than other drugs.

Clark said that the drug .treat—
ment is only one possible treat-
ment, among psychological
counseling and behavioral edu-
cation. WPIC is just one of the
facilities testing the drug, he said.

Scientists are unsure of the

‘cause of panic attacks, theorizing

that it may be a cherrrical reac-

The third and final hurricane
which Hunter made reference to
was the French referendum on
Maastricht. The French vote,

which was more a “perhaps” than -

it was a ‘yes,’’ passed by the nar-
rowest of margins in September.
Despite these shocks, Hunter and
his colleagues stressed that it will
take more than three hurricanes
for people to believe that prosper-
ity lies outside the Community.
Europe has for centuries been a
continent of struggle. It has been
the home for_ two world wars, and
prior to the 20th century countries
were constantly invading one
another. Given these historical cir-
cumstances, the European
Community was a natural and
welcomed progression for smaller

member states like Belgium, the _

Netherlands and Luxembourg. His
Excellency Michael Dooms, the
Belgian Ambassador to the United
Nations, stressed the historical
inevitability of the Community.

sions in the past, one way for
Belgium and the rest of Europe to
survive was to establish them-
selves as one of the six original
founding members of the
Community. “Only cooperation
could, bring peace and prosperity
to Europe,” Dooms said.

The peace and prosperity men-

tioned by Dooms is seen to be

spreading throughout Europe.
Despite the fact that the majority
of Norwegian and Swedish citi-

Hunter, Dooms and Donde all see
that Community expansion will

Mrs. Barbara Noel, the director of
Press and Public Affairs of the
Commission of the European
Communities in New York, said
expansion toward the East is not
feasible because of the financial
commitments involved in being a
member.

Despite all of the problems, the
European Community has strate-
gically placed itself as a world
leader.»

“Citizens are traveling like never
before. Investment is up and
Community membership is a fact
of life for everyone,” Hunter
said. “There are no serious politi-
cal parties in Europe which
oppose the Community, and the
end of 1992 will establish a single
market for 340 million people.”

Misuraca said that it would
be a great chance for stu-
dents to weigh the views and
express their support or dis-
taste for what the debaters
have to say.

“This event will give you a
chance to hear and see more
about this issue than what
you see on T.V., newspapers
and magazines,” Misuraca
said.

He said the debate is coin-
ing in at an opportune time
because the law and order
issue is under constant scruti-
ny by the public, and
because of problems with
violence in Oakland.

The students will be able
to ask the speakers ques-
tions, and they will have a
certain amount of time to
answer the question, much
like the presidential debates,
Misuraca said.

The debate will be moder-
ated by Professor Sandra
Jordan from Pitt’s Law
School.

Misuraca said that this pro-
vides students with a great
opportunity to be educated.

“I do believe that Pitt

Fighting for beans

Sometimes —— OK, usually —-— it is very difficult to
understand the actions of world leaders. Case in point
-— we can understand the confusion that many people
have with the whole trade war between the United
States and the European. Community. After all, it’s just
about a bunch of grapes and beans. The recent tariffs
imposed on the European Community from the United
States do not involve beer, so college students need not
wony just yet. The tariffs were geared mainly toward
French white wines. . '

The front pages of newspapers all around the world
have been graced with the EC/US battle over oil seeds

and wine tariffs. The American position is one of ‘con-

cern over French subsidies, which are seen as distorting
competition and hurting American farmers, while the
French feel that these subsidies are essential for the
livelihood of their agricultural industry. As a result, the
United States has threatened Europe with white wine
tariffs of 200 percent while Europe waits and watches.
This trade war serves to further upset both the already-
strained General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) talks and the fragile world economy.

While the tariffs are aimed at the Community as a
whole, it is hardly a hidden fact that they are directed
toward the French specifically. Facing a large farm
lobby, the French have been among the most reluctant
GATT talk participants to make concessions in the long-
stalled trade talks. ' ,

If the United States truly wanted to hit the French for
their competitive distortions, it would have focused on
more than just white wine. We are the fifth leading
recipient of French wine imports behind several of

France’s EC partners, and these actions will put only a ,

minor dent into French agriculture. For now, we have
to applaud the leaders of the Community who have not
caved in to French demands with needless threats of
retaliation. I '

Nevertheless, the tariffs placed by the Bush adrninis—
tration could have far-reaching effects and lead to "retal-
iatory effects which will spiral through the world econo-
my. As the Community formally warned today, the pos-
sibility has not been ruled out. Understanding the frus-
tration of the Bush administration, these actions are
more for the French and other EC partners to take
notice than they are a real threat. After all, European

subsidies are costing American soybean exporters tons ~

of money. , , .

But at a time when the world economy can ill-afford
actions by leaders which will only serve to make things
worse, it’s time to heed the advice of German econom-
ics minister Jurgen Mollemann, who said, “Political
leaders should find a political solution instead of study-
ing ways and means of retaliating.” In other words, find
an answer or it’s tough beans for everyone. A

A dark cloud hangs over Europe

Jews all over the world light a
candle in the month of
November. The candles are lit to

. commemorate Kristallnacht, “the

night of shattered glass,” when
German Nazis broke the win-
dows of Jewish businesses,
homes and synagogues.

The candles are lit year after
year in the hope that if
Kristalhiacht is remembered then
those atrocities will never be
repeated again. The hope that
ethnic and religious persecution
and holocausts will never occur
again might be in vain. Candles
need to be lit for the ‘victims of
Bosnia—Herzegovina’s ethnic
cleansing and for the rise of eth-
nic hate in Germany against an
inﬂux of immigrants. I

Civil war that has been raging
in former Yugoslavia is a mixture
of an ancient feud between the

church and the people and is an '_

attempt to settle the score for
World War II atrocities.

When the old Yugoslavia col-
lapsed’, the Bosnian majority,
which consists of Muslims or

Croatians, broke with the

Serbians. The Serbians consist of
one-third of the population. In
order to protect themselves from
a Bosnian majority rule they
started a civil war in an attempt
to create their own state.

The Croatians and Slovenes
are now fighting under the
proclamation that the minorities
have the right to self-determina-
tion, which is diametrically
opposed to the Serbian principle
that majorities have rights too.
And one of those rights is to not
have their country broken up
over ethnic strife. . ,

Why then does this civil war in
Eastern Europe cause some sort
of parallel to be made to the
Holocaust during World War 11?
Because the war in Bosnia-
Herzegovina is largely about eth-
nically defining’ a country for
tribal purity. The deaths have
exceeded 10,000, and 50,000
people are reported missing or
“liquidated.”

People are being put into

are caught in the middle. The
United Nations has sent peace-
keeping troops and humanitarian
aid, but it hasn’t done much
good. Convoys attempting to
carry civilians to safety and deliv-
er aid are attacked and
destroyed. .
Talks have been held between
the warring sides, but any type
of peace or ceasefire is not in
the immediate future. The old
territorial divisions between the
Croatians, Slovenes and Serbians

seem incompatible with any sort -

of lasting peace. No settlement
could be reached that would be
able to return every displaced

Rachel
Haynes’ .

family to its former home.

But the parallel to the
Holocaust extends not only to
Bosnia—Herzegovina but also to
Germany and the Eastern
European community. Because

of the atrocities that are occur- A

ring, refugees are ‘ﬂeeing to bor-
dering countries. P _

Germany has accepted the
most refugees — 275,000. But
some of Germany’s citizens want
them to go home. The ethnic
hate that is causing former
Yugoslavia’s- civil war has infect-
ed Germany.

As a result of its reuniﬁcation,
Germany has had a 5 percent
inﬂation increase, record-high
interest rates, basic increased
costs because of unification and
a resistance to converting

German currency to a standard -

European currency. V

A bad economy, high unem-
ployment and homeless Bosnian
refugees have precipitated an
outbreak of Neo—Nazism and a
renewed interest in right—wing
politics. This is frighteningly
comparable to the rise of Hitler
and the blame he and much of
Germany placed on the Jewish
population for its hyperinﬂation
and bad economic times.

What is being done about this

Helmut Kohl, Germany’s chan-
cellor, wants to change the
immigration policy to make
German states refuse to accept
refugees where it can be proven
that no political persecution
occurs. Stopping or changing
immigration policies is only a
Band—Aid solution that will put a
lid on ethnic conﬂicts but will

not cure the root of the problem. _

Germany is one of the leaders in
the European Community. If it
sets a precedent by restricting
immigration policies, then the
world will be able to sit by and
wait for the lid to come off and
the problem to explode.

Eastern Europe is also standing ‘
by and watching. This is one of '

the biggest refugee ﬂoods that
has occurred since 1945, and it is

- an indication that Europe is still
being haunted by its chaotic past
that led to World War II.
Intervention in European civil
wars carries a lot of risks.

One of them is the fear of set— »

ting a precedent for future break-
ups in a very unstable cominuni-
ty by choosing sides. There is
also the mentality that bloody
civil wars only occur in places
like Bangladesh and Ethiopia,
not in an Eastern European
country.

The civil war and ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia—Herzegovina

, is one that extends beyond its‘

tenitory. It is affecting Germany,
the Eastern European community

and impacts worldwide on the

issue of human rights. The ethnic
atrocities are known, but no one
is helping. ,

How long will the killing go
on until it becomes a holocaust?
Kristallnacht serves as a reminder
of the Holocaust. The memory is
kept alive in the hope that it will
never happen again.

But what the world is watch-
ing now in Eastern Europe is
telling us that wars and holo-
causts aren’t confined to history
books no matter how much we
remember them.

Liberal gun laws
not the answer

In responding to Chris Diersen’s momen-
tary desire for a gun [“Standoff at the
Oakland Corale” Nov. 5], I must first make
it clear that I’ve also been in situations
where I wanted a gun. I’ve also felt threat-
ened, frustrated, angry at not being able to
walk safely through my own neighborhood.

But because I’m ‘still somehow able to
see through the illogical, ‘violent fray to a
future tha‘t’s better. I feel compelled to
respond.

-'._ Instead of pulling out guns, we should be

asking questions. Why do we want.and
need guns? Why are we so angry? Why are
these kids so angry? Remember yourself at
14 — if these kids have anything more fun
or useful or inviting to do; why are they
hanging out, hassling and threatening you?
Of course, asking questions takes time.

‘ Finding the answers takes years. It’s -defi—'

 

nitely not a quick fix. And it’s probably not
as glamorous or exciting as a “showdown.”
But what if you had pulled a gun? We’d

9 have dead adolescents. We’d have definite-

ly solved the problem, but only temporarily.
Fifteen minutes, 15 years after the fact,
we’re still angry and scared, kids are still
bored and pissed off, and the ones we shot
are still dead.

You say, “That kid will be dead before
he’s 20 at the rate he’s going, and tliat’s a
shame. ‘But it’s his own damn fault, and I
can’t change the world for him.” Mr.
Diersen, .,he’s not dead, and for now he can

thank you for that. You cibangecl the world

for/aim.

But if “guns for everyone” is the only
solution we can imagine for the problems
we face in our streets, then by all means,
start passing them out. We probably
deserve to be put out of our thoughtless,

Upon reading the account of Sister
Souljah’s Black Week address, I came
across a very disturbing belief expressed by

Racism encompasses everyone

Souljah: “There is no such thing as a black
racist. Racism is a system of power.” ,
‘While.-racism can (andoften does)
emanate from the empowered establish-
ment, it is a practice not conﬁned to any
class, race or creed.
Racism is a belief that race is the primary
determinant of human traits, and all cul-
tures hold some beliefs that parallel this

, idea. «

But these beliefs need not be outright dis-
crimination in order to be racist; generaliza-
tions, stereotypes and prejudice’ are all
forms of racism —— and each may be found
in every level of society.

With the shrinking world that we live in
— especially in American cities ——' race
relations will continue to be a pressing
issue. And with the myth of the homoge-
neous “melting pot” dispelled, we must
learn to live with the ideology of cultural
pluralism — often referred to as the “salad
bowl” effect —- with diverse cultures'peace—
fully co-existing on an equal footing while
retaining their individual identities. Only
then can the specter of racial tendencies be
vanquished and racial accord evolve.

CA8 ‘96

As I was watching the election
returns come in from around the
nation, my disappointment grew as I

' realized that my candidate had been

forsaken for another. Bill Clinton is
the new president of our nation, and
I will just have to deal with it.

I am not going to write a column
on why the sky is going to fall
because of Bill Clinton. He is the
choice of the people, and he
deserves our congratulations and
support. To champion his demise is
to champion the demise of our
nation, and I_ do not think that any-
one wants that. V ‘

Instead, I am going to discuss the
much stronger emotion I felt on elec-
tion night, an emotion that so over-
powers my disappointment that I am
not even that upset that Clinton won.
That emotion is fear. _

T I am, for the first time "ever, really
‘frightened about the future of our
nation, and on a more selfish note,
my future. I did not ignore what
Ross Perot had to say, but I think
that his presence  the race said vol-
umes more than any chart or speech.
The fact that he received 19 percent
of the vote says even more. It says

' that I am not alone in feeling scared.

For most of my life as a cognizant
human being, I have felt rather
secure when I think of the govern-
ment and how it affects me. Sure

With the somewhat newly-elect-
ed Congress and an increasing
number of “minorities” in the polit-

V ical arena, our agenda will hope-

fully begin to lead to more success-
ful answers to questions we
[African-Americans] have been ask-
ing for along time. The past
administration had 12 years to find
answers to the questions of racial
inequality, to implement an agenda
and attempt to bridge the gap of
the continuing separation of the
classes.

This past year fifty-six people

_ were killed and countless others

injured in the L.A. [revoltl riots, and
everyone knows this. And many of
us also believe that this incident
was _not caused by the infamous
verdict but ignited by a system of
oppression in an area, riddled with
poverty and gang violence.
Buildings owned by many ethnic
groups-burned to the ground as the
rest of the country watched in dis-
‘belief.

A few ‘weeks ago, a special on
“Nightline” entitled LA. Riots, Six
Months Later aired. It focused on
the rebuilding efforts of the South
Central, Los Angeles area. Many of
the people interviewed had said
that much hadn’t been done to
"fix" the scars and that most were
disappointed with the lip-service
given by the presidential hopefuls
during their respective visits.

Andat the time, each candidate
displayed great dissatisfaction with
the status quo and promised some-

thing would be done to ensure that.
_ rebuilding efforts would not be

“few‘ and far between.”
Unfortunately, this was and is
not going to be enough. The
real issue here isn't_just about
rebuilding South Central L.A., it
is about the underlying causes
that lit the “bomb waiting to
explode.”

THE PI'lT NEWS, Wednesday, ‘November 11, 1992

everyone complained about it, and
there were always stories of abuse of
power and red tape, but basically it
had its existence and I had mine.
That is about to change. It is going
to change because of three words
that we have ignored for too long:
the national debt.

We were told it wasn’t a problem.
Even my Ron told me and made me
believe that it wasn’t a problem. For
12 years, as our debt grew, I thought
nothing of it. I was not.alone.

The American people forgot, and

Nat  
Finkin

many still forget, a basic aspect of
economics. Loans must be paid back.
Debts -must be paid eventually. And
around 1995, give or take a few
years,. the government must start
paying back nearly 3 trillion dollars

. in loans, nearly all of them from

American banks. Now do yousee
why I am afraid? If you can’t, let me
give you a hint: 1995 is when I, and
most of my friends, are scheduled to
graduate from college and enter into
the workplace.

I don’t know if many of you saw -

the quote from Kevin Dougherty in
The Pitt News issued the day after the
election, but it was quite interesting.

,Hoping Clinton will aa’a’ress

that certainly can’t be remedied
with the simplistic idea of a “ham-
mer and nail,” or a new building.
These problems continue to infest
this country and should not be qui-
etly “sweptunder the rug” by those
who don’t want to believe, in fact,
that this country is imperfect. With
an economy that is presently strug-
gling, the rich are becoming more

Trina
Pharr

distinguishable from the poor. And
now- that the election is over and
the voting booths have -closed;
we [African—Americans] are faced

"with the inevitable task of hoping

vs. believing that our newly-elected

officials won't renege on their

campaign promises. Each election
year, we choose from candidates
who appear to have our best
interests at heart, but unfortunate-
ly, have given us nothing but
political double-talk for our
Vote. .
Nevertheless, most of us contin-
ue to believe in the political
process while at the same time
continue to excuse the apathetic
efforts of some of those in power,
around us. Throughout history, we
have been strategically used as a
political ploy for our majority vote.
It dates as far back as the Lincoln
administration when the Repub-
lican Party actively recruited
African- Americans in an attempt to

build an electorate in their struggle
against the Democrats;

However, during the Compro-
mise of 1877, massive violence was
brought against African-Americans,
and our vote was then transferred
to the Democratic Party [1932] with
the election of Franklin D.
Roosevelt. It wasn’t until the late

_1970s that our vote was sought

after _ once i more by the
Republicans, again in an attempt to

J

It's abig debt and somebody has to pay for it

His fear about the probable lack of
jobs _is quite reasonable, but it will"
not be ‘because of what Bill Clinton
does. Clinton’s promised programs
will most likely create :1 lot of short-
term employment and may possibly
give our economy a much needed
jump-start. The longer the people
proclaim the end of the world
because of Bill Clinton, the less effi-
cient our government will be.
Besides, if we can survive Jimmy
Carter we can survive anything,
right?

The debt is going to hurt us all,

regardless of who is in office. A huge
percentage of our budget is going to
be appropriatedltoward paying back
that debt. This means dramatic cut-
backs in all programs. This means
that if we don’t start paying about 60
percentof our income in taxes, the
road paving jobs that Clinton says

race relations

shift our electorate from the
Democrats. Even in the presidential
election of [1980] we gave the

-Democratic candidate [Carter]

' plish?

90 percent of our vote in
hopes that the status quo would
change.

.And even with an unending loy-
alty to the Democratic Party, some
of our Democratic presidents have
yet to live up to our expectations.
In this past election, 87 percent of
us voted for the Democratic candi-
date Bill Clinton. There was no
doubt that many of us were very
disappointed in the Bush ‘adminis-
tration. With a combination of the
Civil Rights Bill veto, his adminstra-
tion's opposition to affirmative
action and other social programs;
many of us -were faced with the
decision of voting for a president,
who, for the most part, was unsuc-
cessful in his administration’s
attempts to Continue the efforts of
equal opportunity.

So what, do you ask, I hope the
Clinton administration will accom-
I hope they will do more
than recognize the problems of our
cities. To implement the programs
he solconfidently addressed during
his campaign and hope they work.
To continue the achievements
of those before him in bettering
equal opportunity for every-
one. To recognize the symptoms
before the disease and do his
best to prevent what happened

— this past year in Los Angeles, won't

happen again elsewhere. I guess
that's a lot to ask for from our new
president and his adminstration.
But until we [African-Americans]
get a president of our own, I think

“we should give Clinton, and his

adminstration a chance. He won
the election claiming to be the
president for change. He con-
quered that hurdle, so now it's
time to prove it. '

Soccer saves honor of Pitt athletics

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

With the majority of attention on Pitt
athletics focused solely on the high-pro-
file, money-generating football and'bas-
ketball programs, one could get the dis-

tinct impression that the year of 1992 has

been a miserable failure.

But in the midst of football’s nightmare
and basketball’s unknown, a winning
sports story — a Cinderella story at that
— evolved in the Pitt soccer team.

Often thought of as the perennial cellar-
dwellers of the Big East conference, the
Panthers played the role of classic over-
achievers all season — climbing from the
depths of the conference basement a year
ago to finishing second in ‘92 and earning

a spot in the league final four. -
Though they lacked thentalent and
scholarships needed to compete with
national powers like Seton Hall and
Connecticut, Pitt found ways to win all

A year — proving that a team of team play-

ers can beat a team of talented individu-
als. , . ‘

For three of the five departing Pitt
seniors — Michael Bacasa, Carsten Bishop
and Brian Pellegrino — the abrupt sea-
son—ending loss to St. John’s was not the
ideal ending to a Cindere1la'season, but it
doesn’t take away from their stellar final
season.

“It’s been the best season for me in four
years,” Pellegrino said. “The most games
won, the Big East‘ tournament —— the over-

The 1992 Pitt_ soccer season
proved to be a worst-to-first
dream year. After being pegged
to finish last by Big East coaches
in their preseason poll, the
Panthers constructed the most
successful year ever for a school
soccer team.

Here is a game-by-game syn-
opsis of the ‘92 year:

Sept. 5 — At California [Pa.] .

State

Can we start over?

Mistakes killed the Panthers in
a 2-1 loss to open the season.

. Though they outshot the Vulcans

15-5, Pitt allows both Calpshots
inside the penalty box to hit the
twine to let victory slip away.

Sept. 6—Bucknell .

A rehash of the Cal. State
nightmare. 1

The Panthers give up three first
half goals —- two which were last
touched by Pitt defenders — in a
5-2 loss to the Bisons to open the
‘92 home schedule. In a move
that will pay dividends through
the course of the year, rookie
Adam Spitzer replaces Kirk
Brodows in goal at halftime.

Though disappointed by the
start, defender Bob Dyer promis-
es success in Pitt’s tortuous Big
East road trip to open the league
schedule.

“Our adrenaline in going to be
running high [this coming week-
endl,” Dyer said. “I think we’re
going to win ‘em both.”

Sept. 11 — at Providence

Start me up.

In a nationally-televised confer-

ence opener, Pitt nabs its first ’

league win since 1990 in a 5-1
win over the Friars. Goals by Ted
Noethling, Michael Bacasa and
Jeff Porter pace the Panthers,
while /rdam Spitzer earns his first
collegiate win. Dyer’s prediction
is halfway home.

Sept. 15 — at Boston College

As Ed Sullivan would say -— a
reeaally big win!

Despite being outshot 25-7, the
Panthers make the right plays at
the right time in downing the
Golden Eagles, 1-0. Scott
Alexander notches the game’s
only goal (an assist to Prex) as
Pitt-shocks the Big East with a
sweet 2-0 start to the conference

    

occer ’s Cinderella season

schedule. Dyer gets phone call
from Danny Sheridan asking for
advice on upcoming pro picks.

Sept. 16—Geneva

Wake up call.

After theeuphoria over the
mega—weekend, Pitt slips by a
pesky Geneva squad at Pitt
Stadium, 1-0, on a goal by Prex.
The game is the.first of many
lulls-between—the-Big-East-storms
for the Panthers — gimme wins
that aren’t so gimme if Pitt looks
past them to future conference
tussles. Spitzer’s second straight
shutout. ‘

Sept. 19 — Seton Hall

Respect Saturday at Pitt
Stadium. '

The Panthers outduel the 1992
Big East conference champions
on a sun—drenched afternoon to
remember. Two Prex tallies and
a rocket Dean Astorino goal pro-
pel Pitt past the Pirates, 5-2 —
their third straight league win.

Hall Coach Manny
Schellscheidt is ‘impressed.

“They deserve everything they
have accomplished so far,”
Schellscheidt said. “They came
off the field a deserving winner.”

Sept. 25 — at Slippery Rock

Five in a row.

Same old story applies in 5-0
Pitt romp — great defense, solid
tending, clutch scoring. Goals by
Eric Duffy, Bacasa and Prex pace

the Panthers, who dominate the

Rockon both ends of the field to
stretch their winning streak to
five.

Looking toward Sunday’s
showdown against league

Villanova, Duffy calls the Pitt-‘

Nova encounter a must-game.

“Sunday will make or break us
this season,” Duffy said. “If we
win, we should go on to a good
record in the Big East.”

Sept. 27’--Villanova

Another Pitt Stadium soccer
P3113’ - _

On the scorching artiﬁcial turf,
the Panthers outlast the Wildcats,
1-0, on a late goal by Alexander
(assist to Todd Graf) —— sending
another shockwave through the
Big East.

The streaks continue to grow.
Four in a row in league play; six
in a row overall.

Sept. 50 — St. Francis

Crew ends fall with eye onfatare

By Stephen Liss V
Staﬂ' Writer

After a successful fall semester with
new head coaches Rick Kelliher and
Mary Gott at the helm, the Pitt Rowing
Club is setting its sights on a national
championship.

The only problem is, like with any
team sport, it is going to take some time.
With the exception of one person, no
one on the team right now has more
than three semesters of experience.

“We have the nucleus to help make
Pitt a dominant rowing force within a
couple of years,” Kelliher said. “We are
always looking for athletes that want to
be a part of this group.”

“They don’t even know it, but there

- are 20 to 50 people’ walking around this

campus right now that with some deter-
mination and some discipline could help
turn this team into one of the best in the
country,” Kelliher said.

Until Kelliher and Gott came to Pitt
this year, the mood of the team was a lit-
tle different. “With Rick and Mary, there’s
more of a wide-spread competitive
focus,” -senior Anne Schleicher said.

Schleicher is the oldest remaining
member of the team, and she realizes the
value’ of a couple of high—spirited lead-
ers. “You need two people to do this
right. It’s going to be a great opportunity
for the younger members of the team as

Men's X-country heads to IC4As

By Jason Feuchtwanger
and Matt Groff
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s cross country
team will try to make a run at
Nationals as well as gain respect
in District II at the Inter-
Collegiate Amateur Athletic
Association of America (IC4As)
this Saturday at Lehigh University.

Pitt distance coach Jim Lear said,

he has high hopes but realizes
the stiff competition they face.

“In a field of 55 teams, we’ll
have to finish in the top three to

make nationals,” Lear said.”I think
if we run to our potential we can
certainly finish in the top six.”

The Panthers will face national
powers Georgetown and
Villanova as well as strong
regional opponents Penn State,
Iona and Navy.

Pitt co-captain Tom Swartout
was a member of the Pitt squad
that was a national qualifier in
1990 and thinks that this team is
prepared to challenge for the
third and final spot.

Intramural offers chance for armchair athletes to do it on the field

By Josh Roth
For Tbe' Pitt News

The Pitt intramural pro-
gram dates back as far as
anyone can remember. It
dates back over 200 years,
to the first year of the uni-
versity, and continues to be
one of the most popular
activities on campus.

Last year over 8,000 indi-
viduals participated in 16
sports ranging from football
to squash. Basketball and
football are the most popu-
lar sports, with soccer not
far behind.

Marilyn Ross, co-director
of the intramural program,
said that expansion into
new sports is on the hori-

zon.
“Right now we are plan-
ning to schedule beach vol-
leyball as a new sport for
next year,” Ross said. “We
tried to get it started for this
past fall, but we were too

late in scheduling use of the '

sand court facilities at
Schenley Park.”
Ross and co—Director Low

Fabian run the intramural
program, but much of the
work is handled by Pitt stu-
dents themselves.

“We have a lot of students,

who help out with the work.
It is largely a student-run
program,” Ross said.

assistant in the program,

Penguins
tbrecztened
by z'njurz'es

After an 8-0-2 start, the
Penguins have now experi-

enced reality by going 3-3 in I

their last six games (exclud-
ing last night).

Reality brings forth injuries,
and the Penguins have suf-
fered a huge one with left
wing Kevin Stevens being

‘grounded for the next month

following arthroscopic
surgery. Unlike Joey Mullen
or Bob Errey

(two key role players), the
loss of Stevens, who was the,
NHL’s second leading scorer,

C is an obstacle in the way of

the Pens. This is an obstacle
Pittsburgh can overcome.
Unless —— A

Jirn Clark

Mario Lemieux is injured.
Despite scoring goals in 15
of 16 games and being on
pace to break Wayne
Gretzky’s record of 92 goals
and 215 points in a season,
there are some rumors that
Lemieux’s back is acting up
again. These rumors seem to
be backed up by his sitting
on the bench for the second
half of the third period in
Sunday’s game against
Chicago. Despite the fact that
the Pens were’ being blown
out 7-2, it would seem that
Lemieux would play consid-
ering he is after a scoring
record. Despite playing well
in that game (a goal and an ,

assist), Lemieux looked phys-

ically sick or tired.

The Pens have the deepest
scoring team in the league
and one of the best in NHL
history with players like _
Jaromir Jagr, Rick Tocchet,
Ron Francis, Mullen, Larry
Murphy and Shawn
McEachern. The loss of
Lemieux would certainly
drop the Pens out of first
place with the Rangers
already in close pursuit.

-In other Penguin news,
Pittsburgh sent defenseman
Jeff Chychrun to Los Angeles
for defenseman Peter Ahola
last Friday. Chychrun was
acquired last year from the
Kings in the famous Paul
Coffey trade. He was sup-
posed to add toughness to
the Penguin blue line, but for
a goon, he didn’t consistently
show the desire ‘to play a

physical game. That cost him,

year for us,” Swartout
said.”Our main goal is to
qualify for Nationals.
There will be over 300
runners in this race, it’ll
take a great race from all

. of our top five if we’re

going to qualify.”

Lear said that the team
has been working hard in
practice since the Big East
Championships, especially
emphasizing the impor-
tance of running together.

“We hope that we can
get our lead pack to run
together and hopefully run
faster than we did against
the Big East,” Lear said. “I
think that Waddie
[Freeman], Frank [Nesko]
and Mike ILynnl can set a

good pace andpush the

restof the pack.”
After last year’s seventh-
place finish in District II,

the runners said they real-
ize that they need to
improve on last year’s per-
formances.

“Last year I finished

' 100th,” junior Mike Lynn

said. “I think I can make

the top 25 this Saturday.‘

We’ll need our top five
to finish in the top 50
if we want to gain that
last spot. Our region
is packed, there are so
many good teams
that could get that final
spot.”

The course at Lehigh is
longer and flatter than the
Panthers’ home course at
Schenley Park. The 10k
(6.2 mile) race may hold
an advantage for the Pitt

squad.
“The longer race means
we all have to run

relaxed,” Swartout said.
“The extra 1.2 miles will

help us because we have a
lot of gutsy runners. There
will be plenty of room to
pass. It could make a big
difference.”

Lear said that Pitt’s run-
ners will have to stick
together as well as con-
centrate on running their
race. He believes that they
will not be intimidated,
but hopes they will not get
distracted by the other
runners. _

Nesko, a sophomore, is
a consistent to.p finisher
for Pitt and is hopeful
about the team’s outside
chance about getting a
Nationals berth.

“We have the potential,”

Nesko said, “but we’ll
have to overcome" at least
three teams that we’ve
already lost to this year —
Georgetown, Villanova and
Bucknell.”

a seat on the bench in last
years’ playoffs. Chychrun
played in only one game
this year for the Pens, and
he was suspended by the
team for walking out while

' the team was in Ottawa-

two weeks ago.

The 6~foot-5-inch, 205-
pound Ahola "led the Kings
in plus/minus last year as a
‘rookie. He scored seven
goals and 19 points while
accumulating over 100
penalty "minutes.

to get involved.”

Through intramurals, stu-
dents can also try their
hands at being officials for

the games.
“There are courses in the
curriculum that teach

students how to ref basket-
ball and football,” Arcuri,

said. “Officials for the
games come from these
classes.”

A One of the biggest

problems faced by the pro-
gram is scheduling use of
"the facilities with everyone
else who needs to use

‘them.

The varsity sports
naturally get first crack
-at using the facilities
for events and practices.

According to Ross, this

can, make it difficult
to schedule intramural
play.

“It’s. tough finding times
when we can use the facili-
ties and the students them-
selves can play,” Ross said.
“But we take what we can
get. So far, we have been
able to work everything
out.”

For students who drive to
intramural games, parking
can be a big problem.

-about

“Parking up there really
sucks,” Pitt senior Brian
Jacobe said.

“The only place to park is_

the OC lot, and they keep

an attendant there just
long enough to charge.
everyone to park for

just one intramural game.
We pay to play intramurals,
and then we have to pay to
park too. I don’t understand
it. ‘_

. “But once you get there,

playing the games can bea.

lot of fun,” Jacobe said.
Aside from the parking
problem around Trees Hall,
the only thing
which seems to keep stu-

dents away from the pro—‘

gram is that long walk up
the hill. "

“Thousands of people
participate in our program

every year,” Arcuri said.~

“But I feel more would get
involved if our office was
down on campus. They just
don’t want to walk up the
hill.” -

“Nonetheless, our pro— “

gram is very well organized.
It is well worth the,walk up
the hill to get involved.”

The Intramural office is
located in Room 140 Trees
Hall.

well as the newcomers,”
Schleicher said.

Under the new head coaches,
athletes on the crew team will
participate in anyear-long train-
ing program thatincludes row-
ing sessions on the Allegheny
River, weight lifting at Trees
Hall and running steps in the
Cathedral of Learning.

“We want these athletes to
reach their maximum potential,”
Kelliher said. “That’s the only
way we’ll reach our long-term
goals.”

The winning attitude that the
new coaches brought to Pitt has
had some drawbacks. Three
long-term members _ of the
men’s team and four members

7 of the women’s team decided

the new philosophy wasn’t in

their best interest. “There were
some members thatwere a little
upset with the changing of the
guard,” Kelliher said. “I am
happy with the athletes that are
here now, and I hope they
don’t lose their love of the sport
in order to understand the dedi-
cation it takes to win the
national championship.”

The team used the fall semes-
ter as a period of transition,
Gott sa_id. “We needed to
redesign program goals and get
ready for the spring competi-
tion.” ,

Along the way, the Pitt
Rowing Club managed to chalk
up a few notable achievements.
In their third regatta, at the

Occaquan Head Races in.

At the Head of the Charles

Boston, both the men’s and

ﬂeet. Not bad considering it’s an
international event with elite
competition. '

Unfortunately, the team hasn’t
received the recognition it
deserves. “For a school the size

said. “We have a boat house on
the Allegheny'River, two great
coaches and a schedule that
allows us to travel to a lot of
neat places.”

One of the reasons the crew

team has been hampered is that 0

it’s a club and not a varsity
sport. In a couple of years, that
might change. “The best thing
this club could do to get varsity
status,” Gott said, “is to show
we can compete on a national
level. We want to Show the
university that we can create
revenue instead of eat it up.”

Kelliher’s thoughts _ are along
the same line. “When we start
to Show how dominant Pitt can
be, maybe people will start
enrolling at Pitt‘ to be a part of
our team.

“I tell the team now that I
want to beat the schools that
wouldn’t let you.in — the
Harvards and the Yales. It will
take three or four years, but we
can definitely do it.”

The team has set its sights on
the Dad Vail Regatta in
Philadelphia. The meet takes
place at the end of the.upcom-
ing spring season, with the
overall winner of the meet
crowned national champs.

In order to make a
respectable showing in the
spring, Gott and Kelliher will

Soccer

Continued from page 9
all season’s been excellent.

“Being a senior, you’d like
to go out with a good end-
ing. We did that.”

From a brilliant early-sea-
son road sweep of Big East
opponents Providence and
Boston College to upsetting
defending league champs
Seton Hall at Pitt Stadium
and to breaking the school
record for wins in the
season finale against
Robert Morris, the Panthers’
season to remember is filled
with memories that every
team member will never for-
get.

For Bacasa and Bishop, a
starting defender, the‘ big
moment of the year came on
a hot Saturday afternoon in
September.

“It was a big thrill beating
Seton Hall,” Bishop said.
“My first couple years they
beat us like-5-O and 8-1, so
it was a big thrill beating
them 3-2 at home.” -

As for the turning point in
the season, Bishop points to

the team’s sweeping road '

weekend early in the year —
when Pitt opened the league
schedule ' by beating
Providence ' and .Boston

  

-.
0 See You On The Beach

out Now rose A 259 AND EARN A mm  

College. That proved that

the Panthers were for real.
“That first weekend, when

we beat Providence on

Friday and Boston College

on Sunday — that was the
turning point in the season,”
Bishop said.

“We had lost those first
two games that we shouldn’t
have lost, and that weekend
showed the team that we're
just as goodas anyone in
the Big East.” .

While all three seniors feel
lucky to be a part of such a
great story, perhaps no one
on the Pitt squad is more
appreciative of the success-
ful ‘92 campaign
Bacasa.

A little-used‘ walk-on
a year ago, Bacasa emerged
as an integral part of the
Pitt defense in -1992 provid-
ing tight" defense while net-
ting four‘ goals from the
back line. For the Allison
Park native, the key to Pitt’s
success came down to team
attitude andteam atmos-
phere.

“It seemed like there was
more of an enjoyment this
year in terms of atmos-
phere,” Bacasa said. “There
were guys on the team that

HOT! H! HOT!

than

kept things loose and broke
up the serious tone of a
team.
« “That’s the biggest thing
— being relaxed; believing
that we could compete.”
Bacasa’s highlight of the
season was the year" itself —
the everyday competition
and comradery enjoyed by a
group of players committed
to one cause: winning. "
“The whole season, in
general, was a great accom-
plishment,” Bacasa said. “My
senior season has meant the
most to me. I scored the
most goals I’ve ever scored
[four goals] and played with
guys on the team who are

my  best friends.

“I couldn’t ask for any-
thing more.”

The hardest thing about
the end of soccer for
all three departing seniors
is the withdrawal from
the daily grind — practicing,
playing games, etc.

Getting on with your-

“life’s work” is not as
easy as it sounds, according
to Bacasa, who still ‘lifts
with the returning Panthers.
“I’ve been sitting here
talking to my family and

they’ve been asking me"

‘well, what are you doing
'[now that the year is over]?”’
Bacasa said. “I said I’m

bored out of my mind — I
want to play still.

“I’ve been playing sports
all my life  and this is the
last time [I’ll ever play on a
team].”

While the impact of the
five departing seniors will
be felt next year — particu-
larly on defense — Bacasa
sees good things for the
future of the Pitt soccer pro-
gram.

“They’re going to be all
right. With Bobby Dyer,
Prexy [Eric Prex] — I could
go on and on,” Bacasa said.
“There’s definitely a solid
foundation for a good pro-
gram.” ‘

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 11, 1992

Ij ‘ l
Schedule

Continued from page 9
of the ‘Burgh.

Pitt outshoots St. Francis, 10-5,
in pasting the Flash for the team’s
seventh straight win. Offensive
stars: Dean Astorino (two goals)
and Eric Prex (late goal). What
else is new? .

The game allows Pitt Coach

’ Joe ‘Luxbacher to rest his troops.

“This is the ninth game in 25
days,” Luxbacher said. “That’s a
lot of soccer. We wanted to win,
but tonight we wanted to play
more players than we have been.
{Our younger guys] responded.”

Oct. 4 — at Georgetown

Eight in a row? No. V

The Hoyas slow down the Pitt
upset machine on a Sunday after-
noon in D.C. Final: G’town 2, Pitt
'1. Bacasa nabs the lone goal as
Pitt goes down for the first time

in league play. Spitzer endures

his first collegiate loss.
Oct. 7.-— Carnegie Mellon
Back on track. .

. Rookies shine in Pitt’s 2-0 win
against Forbes Avenue foe CM.
Astorino notches both Panthers
goals and Spitzer gets yet another
shutout. Fast—gun Astorino ‘is
diplomatic about his improving

. role as an offensive star for Pitt.

— “I_’m just looking to contribute,”

Astorino said. “If someone else is

open and has a better shot, I’m.

going to let them have it.”

If not — as Astorino showed
against CM — he lets opponents
have it. -

Oct. 11———s’ -Buffalo

Bulfaloed in Pitt Stadium.

Pitt loses just its second home
game of the year — 1-0 to" the
SUNY crew on a Sunday after-
noon. Goalie Eric Lurie stops 10
shots and Mike Durante scores
on a breakaway to lead Buffalo.
The Panthers are shutout for the
first time in the season.

Luxbacher points to defensive
lapses as the key to the loss.

“We didn’t play well defensive-
ly,” Luxbacher said. “We had
lapses.”

Oct. 16—Connecti'cut

Another Big East knockout.

In a Friday night fight to the
finish, Pitt upends UConn, 1-0, at
a frigid Pitt Stadium. The win

, propels the Panthers to the Big

East final four for just the second
time ever. The team celebrates
by pulling a Harry Carson —
dousing Coach Luxbacher with
ice water on the sidelines follow-
ing the game.

The chilly coach admits his ‘

team was outplayed, but will
take a win any way he can.

“We were outplayed — we
might have been lucky —— but we
got the goal,” Luxbacher said.

Oct. 21 -—Ca.nisius

Blowout city. ‘

Canisius is no match for the
Panthers, as six different players
score goals in a 6-0 Pitt win.
Charlie Wasson, ].L. Gorsin, Prex,
Walter Lamory, Astorino and
Noethling account for the soccer
half-dozen, while Spitzer contin-
ues his shutout stiing. '

On to the ‘Cuse.

Oct. 25 -— Syracuse

Lone sister—kiss’er.

In a rarity for the ‘92 team,
Pitt lets a _2—0 first-half lead slip
away in a 2-2. Big. East tie to
the Orangemen at Pitt Stadium.
Noethling’s offensive burst in
the early going-_ (both Pitt goals)
is wasted, as Spitzer ‘ and
company allow two second
half goals to ‘Cuse for the stale-
mate.

Luxbacher is dissatisﬁed.

“We’re disappointed to ‘come
away with a tie. We wanted to
win.” i -

Oct. 28 — Grove City

Burying of the Grove.

Eric Prex— scores two goals as
the Panthers retum to their win-
ning ways — downing Grove
City, 4-0, at Pitt Stadium. The win
ties the school record for most
wins by a Pitt soccer team, as the
Panthers improve to 11-4-1 on
the year.

John Lopus and Alexander

 

Kelly Casey/T he Pitt News

Charlie Wasson and the Panther soccer team fended oﬂ’ enough opponentsto win 12 games.

score the other two Pitt goals.
Oct. 31 ——’at St. John’s
Halloween nightmare. _
Pitt closes its ‘92 league sched-
ule with a 4-1 loss at regular sea-
son champion St. John’s, ending
the year 5-2-1 in the Big East.
Despite the blowout loss, Pitt
gains the No. 2 seed in the final
four as a result of finishing sec-
ondin the final league standings.
Prex gets Pitt’s only goal on a
penalty kick.
Nov. 3 —Robert Morris
Record—setter.

The Panthers enter the school
record books as the winningest
team in history -— notching their
12th win of the year in a 2-0 win
over inner-city foe Robert Morris.

Duffy and Noethling scored
first-half goals, leading Pitt
past the Colonials in convincing
fashion. Spitzer also gets a
piece of his_tory with his 10th
shutout of the year —- tying
the school record set. by current-
Pitt assistant David Torrence in
1985. . ‘

Playoff time.

Nov. 6 — Seton Hall at
Storrs, Conn.

The paity’s over, says the Hall.

In just their‘ second postseason
appearance ever, the Panthers
are sidetracked for the season by
a dominant, determined Pirates
squad. Though the game was
tied 1-1 after a Bacasa goal
(assists to Noethling and Carsten
Bishop), Pitt could not handle a
powerful Seton Hall team -hitting
on all cylinders.

The final record of Pitt’s best
soccer team ever: 12-6-1.
