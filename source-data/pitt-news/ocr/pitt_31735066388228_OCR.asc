U. of Illinois adminstrator among presidential finalists

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

A University of Illinois administrator is
among five or six finalists for the Pitt
presidency.

Robert M. Berdahl, vice chancellor for
academic affairs of the Lfniversity of Illinois
at ljrbana-Champaign, will visit Pitt
tomorrow and Wednesday.

The presidentialsearch committee has
identified five definite presidential
candidates who will visit Pitt’s campus
during the next month. It has not yet been
determined if the sixth candidate is still in
the running, according to presidential-

search committee chairperson Farrell
Rubenstein.

Berdahl, S4, is second in command at
til. He has served as the vice chancellor
and as a history professor there since
1986. U is a large, state-supported school
with over 35,000 students enrolled in
1990.

Berdahl received his bachelor’s degree
from Augustana College in 1959. lie went
on to earn his master’s degree at [11 in 1961
and his doctorate at the University of
Minnesota in 1965.

Berdahl has held positions as a history
professor at both the University of
Massachusetts and the University of

Oregon.

At Oregon, he served as the dean ofArts
and Sciences from 1981 to 1986.

Berdahl could not be reached for
comment.

According to L’! Student Body President
Gail Stern, if Berdahl were to be Pitt’s new
president, it would be “a tremendous loss
to lllll.

“Berdahl is one of the most ethical,
even-handed individuals I have met," Stern
said. "When I think of someone who cares
about students, I think of him.’

Stern said that Berdahl has recently
come under fire for proposing a 10-percent
tuition hike for undergraduate students.

‘Though I disagree with him, I think he
is doing it for the right rasons. He really
believes that he can better this institution,‘
Stern said. ‘That makes him an adversary
that you can both respect and work with."

Stern said that there have been many
times when Berdahl has helped her.

“There have been countless times where
he has really gone out on a limb for me
personally when I have gone up against
the university. He has stood by me," Stern
said.

Stern said that Berdahl has a reputation
for fairness.

‘I think he would make an outstanding

portion of the black student body,
came together to discuss how to

As the open forum in the David
Lawrence I fall auditorium began,

American students are
experiencing at Pitt are not unique.

The struggle that is here is going
on all over the country."

Black students seemed to be
most concerned with their limited
social resources.

measles

By Renee Crespy

Two Pitt students have been
diagnosed with measles,
according to Candy Miller, head
nurse at Student Health Service.

‘One Pitt student has been
diagnosed with measles at
Shadyside Emergency Center. The
emergency room diagnosed it as
measles, but it hasn’t been
absolutely confirmed by blood
tests just yet. It takes a while to
diagnose measles, so as of now
it's not laboratory conﬁrmed,”
said Miller.

Another Pitt student was
diagnosed as having measles but
has not yet developed the red
rash that is one of the main
symptoms of measles.

Miller said improper vac__cine
injections are to blame for this
latest outbreak of measles.

"The vaccines are working if
people were injected correctly.
You must have received an
injection before 12 months of age
and then a second one sometime
after that. Many of our students
fall short of that second injection,

By Rebecca Wilkins

The progress of professional women in
fields ranging from art to the medical and
legal professions was the topic of a
conference held at Pitt over the weekend.

There were two hundred women and
men registered for the conference, which
was held in honor of \V;‘oniens History
Month.

‘The Obstacle Course; Prnfessionai
Women Past to Present’ began Friday
with tit opening of anexhibit at the Frick
Fine Arts Gallery. The exhibit, ‘A Personal
Journey: Women Artists,‘ contains works

by 15 women artists and is on display
through April 28.

Gerda Lerner, professor at the University
of Wisconsin at Madison, was the featured
speaker Friday evening. She gave a
historical overview of educated women.

A common theme underlying all of the
events was that despite the great strides
American women have made, the fight is
not yet over.

‘Whatever equality of access women
have gained has been the result of
unremitting effort and struggle by these
women lof the last 150 yearsla“ said Lerner.

‘There cannot be complacent

lharneyls, ZeIda’s and the
fraternity houses that they don‘t
cater to what we want. The
only way to fulﬁll our social
needs is to go outside the
campus area.‘

Because 95 percent of the
social activities black students
participate in are held in the
William Pitt L'nion, BAS would
like to have transportation for
those who live off campus.

\\"hiIe some black students
support the idea of having
transportation provided for
social events, others would like
to have a van so that they could
attend church on Sunday
mornings.

Ligons said that because
blacks only make up 7 percent
ofthe total student body at Pitt,
particular attention should be
paid to their academic needs.

‘We are not just a special
concern because we are black
students," Ligons said, “but

because we are doing st : tudié.’
academically. special atzention

To help improve the retention
rate, BAS is asking for more
black faculty and for study
groups to be organized on a
large scale. BAS is working
with the university to have tutors
in the black studies department.

BAS would like to see more
money put into the tniversity
Challenge for Excellence
Program, a program designed
to aid incoming minority
students.

BAS is also trying to increase
the number of students in
Quest, a program formed
within L'CEP for science and
math majors, from 30 to 45.

On a cultural level, BAS
would like to come up with a
comprehensive plan to enhance
the atmosphere for blacks on
campus. Ligons said, “We would
like Student Activities to fund
one—half of perforniances‘ by
the Kuntu Repertory 'l’hcatre
so that ticket prices could be

more affordable to black
students.‘

BAS also wants the university
to increase recruitment for the
four main black Greek
organizations, which will
provide more cultural
()ppOfIUI‘.lU(3$ for black students.

\x'1iile BAS continues to work
with the university to improve
social, academic and cultural
aspects, the organization will
also work to improve its
relations with the black student
body and other black
organizations.

As the struggle continues, BAS
plans to get more students
involved by better
communication and increased
prograrris to whidi students can
respond, according to newly
elected Chairperson, Marta
liffinger.

Craig Ford, a senior,
suggested that BAS reevaluate
its positions as the main black
organization. “Change the
mode of BAS; make it a home
for the black students," he said.

MEASLES AT PI'IT!!

A Pitt student is suspected to have measles, also known as Rubeola.
red or hard measles or 10-day iiieasles.

Measles is highly contagious and can be spread from -i days before syinptoiiis
develop until Ii days after the rash appears. The time from exposure to the
virus until the symptoms appear is 8-15 days. The early symptoms are fever,

headache, cough, runny nose and eye discomfort followed by a
generalized red rash. If these symptoms develop, call the Student
Ilealth Service immediately at 648-2841.

Measles is on the rise among college students because the protection
provided by the measles vaccines they received in childhood is declining.

Anyone born after 1956 now requires 2 DOSES OF LIVE MEASLES VACCINE
AFTER THE AGE OF ONE YEAR in order to be adequately protected. This
means that many people who thought they were safe because they were
vaccinated as children now need to be vaccinated a second time.

If you have not received the required 2 doses of measles vaccine, there is
still time. Measles vaccine is available at the Allegheny County Health
Department, 3/i/i1 Forbes Ave. from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 1:00 p.m.
to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. The phone number is 578-8060. The cost
for the immunization is 515. Don't delay — you may be able to prevent a
serious disease for yourself and help curtail an outbreak at Pitt.

Israeli pilot shares Gulf war experiences with Masada

By Leon Fuksman
stag’ wmer

When Moshe Iizer was a child.
he dreamed of flying heroic
missions and defending his
country.

Today. Ezer IS a mayor in the
Israeli air force.

Ezer spoke at a Pitt Masada
meeting Friday afternoon about
his experiences as a helicopter
pilot and answered (]U(‘\ll()fiS
regarding the effects the Persian
Gulf war had on Israel. I-F/er's
presentation was part of.\Iasada‘s
celebration of Israel \\'eek.

Throughout his nine years of
navigating a helicopter, he
transported civilians hurt in car
accidents and injured soldiers
wounded in domestic violence
to hospitals.

“Being a pilot is glorious I
want to help my country, and I
do that by putting my heart into

my job," said I-ircr, a gradiiate of

liarlon lfniversity with a dual
dt,‘gfCCInCt‘()tI()IIIIt‘.\;IIltlpttlllltdl
science.

He still recalls the night Iraq
launched the first Said missiles
at Tel Aviy. His duty was to ﬂy a
helicopter and locate where the
missiles landed Piloting a
helicopter during the attack made
Iizer feel safer than sitting as a
target in a sealed room wearing a
gas mask.

‘I heard the bombs hit and
could feel the houses shake. This
wasn't a good feeling, and this is
something I will never forget,‘
said Iizer, 31. ‘The Scuds Could
be seen from anywhere in Tel
.-\viv The missiles looked like
balls of fire falling from the sky."

One evening after the war
began, Iizer was driving with his
two sons on a road outside Tel
.-\viv. The sky suddenly lit up as
six Scuds darted across the
ll()fl'/.()fI.

"The vision was like
Independence I)ay but not the
feeling It was very scary and
made me feel insecure," I-izer
srtitl

He said that night reminded
hirii of the war with Iebanon. Ile

enem_y lines to where the war
was being fought

‘I didn't know whether the
next bomb could hit me. I felt my
adrenaline pumping because I
was excited and also scared.‘ he
said.

He felt the same emotions
during the week of the Iraqi
assault on Israel, which killed
two Civilians.

Ever said that many pilots would
have died trying to find the Scud
missile launchers if Israel had
retaliated against Iraq. Yet Israel,
according to Ezer, had devised a
plan to attack Iraq in case the
coalition failed.

“It was very smart for Israel not
to retaliate. The missiles were not
that threatening, and America did
a very good job securing Israel,"
said Pitt senior Marc Reiter, the
president of Masada.

Iizer said that the Israelis, after
years of conflicts with their Arab
neighbors, are accustomed to
dealing with such attacks. The
new Soviet immigrants showed

the most fear because they never
dealt with war, he said. Israeli
officials responded by translating
gas-mask and emergency-
television instructions into
Russian.

According to Ezer, over ~i,ti~ix)>
Soviet_lews arrived daily in Israel
prior to the war. But that figure
dropped to single digits when
the first Saids landed. when life
returns to normal, he is confident
Israel will host even more Soviet
immigrants than before the
conflict.

But these newcomers will still
face the Palestinian uprising, If‘/er
said.

Hours after the allies declared
a cease-fire with Iraq, Palestinians
rushed into the streets and
restarted the violence, according
to Ezer. The scene duplicated the
same turmoil prior to the war, as
several Jews were murdered and
dozens of Palestinians were
arrested.

saw how the government
responded to the uprising.

‘The Israelis treat the Palestinian
issue secondary to their economic
problems. There are Soviet Jews
coming, and there’s also
unemployment which must be
dealt with first,‘ he said.

Shore said that Americans view
Israel's main interest in its
economic problems as the root
of the conflict. Now the Bush
administration is trying to settle
the Palestinian crisis.

“I am scared that America might
force Israel to do something they
don't want to do. And this could
put Israel in great danger," said
Reiter.

Iizer believes the uprising will
continue for months, and peace
in the Middle Fast is not near. “It
is not safe for Jews to go to Arab
villages," said Iizer.

Reiter said he was pleased with
I-I’/er’s informative comments. “We
wanted to get [a speaker] who
was actually part of the war. Ile
is honest and has the opinions of
Israelis," said Reiter.

president," she said.

In accordance with the search
committee's policy of
confidentiality, Berdahl is the only
candidate whose name has been
released.

As other candidates visit the
campus, their names will also be
released.

“All invited candidates are
outstanding individuals, each of
whom is well qualified to be the
next president of the University
of Pittsburgh," Rubenstein stated
in a letter to campus leaders.

Rubenstein did say that none
of the finalists are from a
corporation or foundation.

“All are in the education ﬁelds,”
Rubenstein said.

During the campus visits,
Berdahl and other candidates will
meet with various administrators,
faculty and student leaders. The
candidates will also be
interviewed by campus groups.
Rubenstein is asking that all
groups and individuals who
interview the candidates submit
written comments to the search
committee.

The interview process is also to
familiarize candidates with current
issues and concerns at Pitt,
Rubenstein’s letter states.

“It is important that the
individuals and groups who meet
with the candidates provide them
with information that will enable
them to assess the virtues and
successes of the university, as
well as its shortcomings, needs
and aspirations," Rubenstein said.

The search committee is
expected to submit a list ofthree
candidates to the office of the
chairperson of the Board of
Trustees in April.

The office consists of BOT
Chairperson John Marous and
Vice Chairpersons Howard Love
and Frank Mosier.

The chairperson’s office will
make the final recommendation
to the BOT, which will vote on
whether to hire the candidate.

right now and more on the way.
We do it to help the kids out.‘

‘Hi! How are you?’ Sonia llenze
said as one of the children walked
by her Quo Vadis-sponsored
booth. She was rewarded with a
hug for her friendliness.

‘Quo \'adis has a booth every
year. It's really easy. This year we
have a fish pond. We have six
members here this year. It's
something fun. Everyone can do
an activity," she said, waving her
fishing pole.

“It's quite a treat," said junior
Andrew Gould, who has been
participating for three years.

“You Come out feeling good
about yourself. It's an eight-hour
Christmas for these kids. It's one
of the best things l've seen any
university offer. For the kids to
come out makes it a good day. I
look forward to it every year. The
organization really puts tiigt-tlit-r
a class act. l-Iverything"s done
perfectly. The whole day is a
perfect day," (‘iould said

Senior Tom Ktibilitis, in his first
year of participation, played
“lloopiethe(I|own" totliedeliglit
of many children.

“ll looked like it would be a lot
of fun. Kids are great fun I just
walk around and entertain the
Crowd," he said.

The Telephone l’ion('ers of
America were another group of

clowns in attendance. Sue Schultz
played ‘Droopy Drawers‘ and
was accompanied by 25 other
members of the telephone
organization.

‘Last year was the first year
we'd been invited to Hand-in-
Hand. We also go to area nursing
homes and the SpecialOlympics.
All our clowning is for charitable
organizations. We love it. The
kids [are] so wonderful. The
students are great. We enjoy the
different activities and seeing
everyone having fun. We were
just amazed last year and are glad
tobebackthis year,'said Schultz.

Senior Brian Check, another
coordinator, said, “It's my fourth
year with Hand-in-lland. l was
interested in children, and 1 want
to go to med school. l was afraid
of treating handicapped children
and thought this was the best
way to get over it."

“ We work all year for this one
day. There are 35 members on
our senior staff. We get money
from corporate grants, such as
lleinz, the Scaife Faniily liund
and .'\l(‘()1l. We're also a stibsidiary
ofthe I 'nited Way and get riioney
from them all year. Primarily the
children come from institutions
from all over Allegheny (Iounty,
Check said. "It's unique because
the children don't have the
opportunity to get out much.
This year volunteers were a

primary concem_ but it's turned
out to be the biggest year for one-
on-ones. Without oneon-ones,
it wouldn't exist, we couldn't ex-
ist without the support ofthe stu-
dents. Our entertainment is bas-
ically what we've used in the
past, what kids have liked in the
past.‘

Ellen and Bob Schall came from
Mount lebanon with their seven-
_vear-old son, Aaron.

‘It's hts first festival. He has
pervasive developmental
disorder We heard about [lland-
in-Hand] through the rehabil-
itation institute where he goes to
school lt's really impressive;
we've never seen anything like it.
We're from Toledo and came to
Pittsburgh because we thought
there would be more oppor-
tunities for a child like Aaron. I'm
having such a good time,” said
lillen Schall.

“We were planning on leaving,
btit we're staying. We're really
inipressed. I like the feeling we're
getting from the students. They
really want to participate."

“It looks well-organized;
obviously a lot ofelTort went into
this," added her husband, Bob.

“This means so much to parents.
With a child like Aaron, you can't
just leave him at a festival. But he
came up and told me he's already
looking forward to next year,"
I-Ellen said.

The program ended with the
combined choirs singing “All That
llath Life & Breath Praise, Ye The
Lord" by Rene Clausen, a song
that displayed the talents and
abilities of these two different
choirs to adapt and come together
to produce a successful and
inspiring performance.

“It was really beautiful the way
the choirs meshed," said Cold-
smith. “There was an amazing
lack of problems, giving a sense
of magic to the way it worked."

Marla Furjanic, a member of
the Heinz Chapel Choir, said,
‘We came together well here, as
well as at their campus, where
the Penn State choral members
showed us the social life at their
campus.‘

The Intercollegiate Choral
Exchange program demonstrated
that these two potential rival.s can
work together to produce a per-
formance of musical mastery. The
two choirs performed the same
pieces at University Park campus
on Saturday before bringing the
performance to the 53-year-old
Heinz Memorial Chapel. The

« after King was ordered out of his

mecii

If you don’t like Bush, just don’t Vote for him

Recently, Ramsey Clark told Pitt students that
President Bush should be impeached. Although
I protested this war from the beginning, I must
state that I. disagree with the position of the
former attorney general as well as the The Pitt
News editorial which stated that Bush should be
investigated for war crimes.

George Bush had next to nothing to do with
this war. He didn’t start or stop the war; rather
he was a symptom of it.

So, of the innocent Iraqis (and Americans)
that were killed, who’s to blame? Those 87
percent of Americans polled who said they
advocated the war (and the other 13 percent as
well) who are also petroleum consumers. In
other words, all of us.

One thing I noticed through the various
marches, demonstrations, flag-waving and
pomp, was that no one has taken even one iota
of responsibility for creating this situation. We
created the oil moguls of the Middle East
because of our own greed in purchasing oil
more cheaply.

The only way that a ruthless killer can become

« powerful is if we value something that he or she

owns. Then, when a monster like Saddam
Hussein emerges, we cannot remain totally
innocent because we were the ones who wanted

his oil initially.

We did give him the money. We did give him
the power; unfortunately we didn’t foresee his
horriﬁc crimes against his own people. We
didn’t realize how abusive he would be with the
power we gave him.

The whole point that Bush should be inves-
tigated for “war crimes” is inane. War is a crime,
and if we all play war, then we’re all criminals.

Even though I disagreed with the policy-
makers, I can’t put all of the blame on one or
two people. Bush was not calling all of the air
strikes; lest we forget, he was safe in the United
States. Battle plans were being changed and
modified from moment to moment.

We must also remember I that the United
States was joined by a coalition military force --
albeit the numbers who participated from this
coalition compared to the United States were a
bit skewed — so we were not alone when the

I was watching a news report on
police brutality, a subject with which
most Americans are familiar. A
policeman said that officers who
get shot and killed are the victims of

James
Davis ,

Angeles.

police bmtality. That statement leads
me to ask a question: What is police
brutality to the citizens?

The answer came early this month
when a 25-year-old black man
named Rodney King was stopped
by several Los Angeles police of-
ficers for speeding and was merci-
lessly beaten by 15 officers.

According to local eyewitnesses,

car, an officer hit him with a stun
gun. That gun delivered a shock of
50,000 volts through King’s body.
The officers proceeded to beat him

with night sticks and to kick him in
the head and kidneys. King was
hospitalized for leg and facial in-
juries including swollen eyes and
lips and the loss of several teeth.

When the assault occurred, a 31-
year-old white man got his
Camcorder out to record this de-
grading event. The man who re-
corded the assault didn’t realize
how he helped to bring this trag-
edy to the attention of the media
and the public.

This kind of treatment, however,

bombs were being dropped.

Ramsey Clark has every right to be angry with
this war, as does the majority of the editorial
board at T7iePitt News. However, it is much too
easy to just point fingers at the bad guy, be it
George Bush or Saddam Hussein.

If we don’t want a person like Saddam to
controlta large percentage of the oil market,
then do not give him the ‘power in the ﬁrst
place. If we don’t want a president like Bush,
who has appointed himself and the United
States as the world's police, then don’t vote for
him. '

We don’t cure cancer by cutting off the head
of the person. We work on the cancer itself. If
the disease is lack of alternative fuel, then
demand the technology. If the sickness is a
mentality that advocates war as the only answer
to a conﬂict, then vote for the lawmakers that
are opposed to it. V . I

The war is over. If we don’t want a repeat
performance in our lifetime, then we have to
change the circumstances that led up to the
Persian Gulf ' situation. Part of that change

_ comes in ‘taking responsibility for our actions.

Gates should resign for police   racism

Two years ago at a
Grateful Dead concert at the Civic-
Arena, there was aconfrontation
between several “Deadheads” and
the police. One news clip showed
an officer hitting a young man on
the head with a stick as the young
man was entering the police truck
— after he was arrested. Despite
the public outcry supported by
Mayor Sophie Masloff and demands
for a civilian board, the charges
against the officer was dropped by
a police review board.

According to Daryl Gates, LA
police chief, the three officers in-
volved were suspended without
pay and charged with felonies.
Those three, along with 12 other

officers, -will be questioned by the

his veracity into question.

Ligbtﬁnozl   t/aoug/otfor serioz/ts ﬁnals week; 

Well, it's that time of year again, when Pitt
students are just getting back on track after
spring break and beginning to get the first signs
of final-exam anxiety attacks. So what’s the best
solution? Blow off work, enjoy the weather and
just relax while the last four weeks of school roll
by. When'I was relaxing this past weekend, I
pondered some very serious topics I would like
to share with you:

-How come breakfast foods use selﬁshness
as a marketing strategy? For instance, that damn
Trix commercial. Let the rabbit have some
already. Jeez, they've been using the same
tactic for at least 20 years. We can also observe
this phenomenon in Cocoa and Fruity Pebbles
commercials. Come on, Fred, it’s not as if you
can’t spare one lousy bowl of cereal for your
best buddy Barney. My favorite, though, has got
to be the (Leggo my) Eggo Waffles commercial.
I’m sorry, but what kind of family has members
who trick one another out of waffles? Maybe a
toaster schedule is in order so everyone can
have a fair turn at making a measly waffle. .

°Last week when I registered for my fall
classes, I was amazed at how manypeople
were being called ahead of me, even though
they came in after I did. When I decided to

Amy DiMarco
inquire about this oddity, the woman who
works at Thackeray Hall said she’s called and
called my name, and when I didn’t answer
(because I couldn't hear her), she moved my
name to the bottom of the pile. Idiscovered that
I wasn’t the only one this happened to. The
woman explained, “It’s hard to scream over this
many people, and my throat is getting sore, so
if you kids can’t‘ hear me say your names, that’s
not my problem.”

Then it struck me — a simple yet brilliant
plan. Why doesn’t Pitt install a public-address
system in that room in Thackeray to save the
students a lot of anxiety and time, not to
mention voices?

-You know that ad that says, “You’ve come
a long way, baby?” Well, theré’s one man (and
I use the term loosely)‘ who has reversed any
progress that women’s-rights activists have
fought for over the last 100 years. Gerardo, an

. MTV video celebrity, represents a giant step

backward for womankind. His video, “Rico

~ Suave,” features him baring his chest and stroking

-I don't think this is common knowledge,‘ but i

of \\1’illiarn and Mary.

During the first rotation of the cornp-etition,
Pitt, 'l't.m'son and \\”illiart‘i and Mary were given
byes, while lf.\'ll, the ljrtiversitv of .\lar_vl;md,
.\'ortheastern ljniversitv and jariies Madison
Lriiversity began the Cornpetition.

All four events were under way sirtrultzmer rush’.

for the tiverage fan, it was hard to keep track
of everything that was happening. if a fan had a
favorite event, he or she was bound to see it
pcrforinetzl. During the setoritl rotation the
Lady Panthers were working the tloor ext:r'cises,
while Towson vaulted, t\larylarid worked bars,
and ‘Williani and Mary worked the beam.

The Lady Panthers handed in excellent floor
perfornianct-s and scored a *i7.St.). Mthough the
floor performances were strong, the Lady Panthers
experienced a few problems. I)uring'l'ina 'l'aylor’s
first tumbling pass, she missed the landing of her
double back flip and landed out of bounds. The
remainder of'l'aylor's routine was strong enough
to earn her a 9.15.

Other strong floor scores were turned in by
Kristin Brown (9.65). Jeannie Vecchio (9.60),
Gina Vent“/.ia (9.50), Karen jorgensen (9.45) and
Carrie (Iarnesale (9.30).

During the fourth rotation the Lady Panthers
were working the vault. The Pitt squad kept true
to its form for this season and broke yet another
school record. ‘the lady Panthers scored a 46.60
on the vault, which broke the 1988 school record
of 46.55.

Turning in powerful vaults for Pitt were \’ene/.ia
(9.rl()), Carnesale (9.35), Taylor (9.3), Vecchio
(9.30) and Brown (925).

The fifth rotation opened with Pitt on the
uneven bars. Again the Pitt sqtiad proved that the
only thing to do with records is break them The

her teammates. However, she
did not let her injury keep her
away from the gym. liarly in the
season liortthers had decided to
become the best manager the
gvrnnastics team would ever
liave.

“I still feel like a part ofthe team,
and 1 went out a winner,” said
liorcliers. ‘‘I’ll always miss the
sport. 1 love the sport, btit I had
a great four years at Pitt, and I
don't regret at single thing."
llorchers is a three-time letter

Fights mar Bulls’ season ending loss to New York Saints

By Ethan Lott
Sla17'Wrller

Tensions ran high Saturday night as the
Pittsburgh Bulls and the New York Saints,
both out of playoff contention, battled it
(R1121 the Civic Arena. Both teams seemed
to take lessons from the halftime judo and
Tae Kwon Do demonstrations.

After a well-played first half, the players
came out ﬁghting late in the third quarter

and throughout the fourth. When all the
bodies were cleared away and the 15
penaltiestotalling 39 minutes were served,
New York prevailed 23r13.

The Bulls ﬁnished the year at 343, while
the Saints ended up 5-5.

Despite all the ﬁghting, there was a
game going on, and two players gave all—
star performances in their teams’ final
game of the 1991 season.

Pittsburgh's No. 12 Brian Nikula and

New York‘s No. 12 Don Borges combined
for 12 goals. Borges’ seven goals tied the
MILL record set by Mark Gold in 1988 and
tied this season by Detroit's Paul Gait.
Asked if he was thinking about the
record late in the game, Borges responded,
"Sevens the record’ If I’d known, I
would've gone for eight.’ Borges recorded
the game MVP award for his performance.
The Bulls opened the game with two
goals sandwiched around the five-minute

mark of the first quarter. New York made
it 2-1 with a powcr—play goal two minutes
later.

Brian Nikula then netted his first goal,
and Brendan Kelly added the first of his
three on the night, giving the Bulls a 4—1
lead. New York responded by scoring
three straight to tie the game, the last one
with only seven seconds left in the quarter.

The second quarter went much the

same way: neither team led by
more than one goal. liach team
scored four, and they went into
the locker rooms tied at eight.
As it happened so many times
for the Bulls this season, the third
quarter sealed the game away for
the visiting Saints. New York

“opened the third with the first of

the half’s 10 penalties and
promptly netted a shorthanded
goal to move ahead by one.

’Ihen Borges went to work. He
scored his team‘s 10th and 11th
goals; Gordon Purdie added
number 12, and in the Bulls were
down by four. Butch .-\larino
broke the momentum with his
third goal on the night and 23rd
on the season, but the Saints
scored four of the quarter’s ﬁnal
five goals —— two by Borges — to
lead 16-10 after three.

The fourth quarter was just
plain ugly. In between quarters
the Saints’ Scott Huff was ejected
and given a five-minute penalty.
The Bulls were unable to take
advantage of the power play
because the Jeff Klodzen was
whistled for slashing 38 seconds
into the quarter. The Saints scored
twice during the major penalty,
including a shonhanded goal by
Borges, his sixth, to lead 1840.

Q At the five-minute mark

teammates Butch Marina and
Wayne Gebelein were called for
roughing and slashing penalties,
giving the Saints a two-man
advantage.

‘There's no bad blood between
us. Actually, we play summer
ballwithalotofsaints. Itwasjust
frustration,‘ said Marino.

foul, Marino said, ‘He was
taunting me, and l retaliated. The
referee just missed it.‘

Butch hinted that he may retire
after playing in the All-Star game
April 2() in Philadelphia. “The
only things that would keep me
playing are all my friends on the
team and the Pittsburgh fans, the
best in the league."

'l1ie Saints added two more
goals during the power play to
goup 2()-10,before .\'ikula scored
his fourth and fifth goals of the
night, giving him 18 on the year
(second on the team). Kelly
finished his hat trick for the Bulls,
and Borges added his record-
tying goal to make the score 22-

his third on the night to round out
the scoring.

The Saints’ Tim Mclntee scored
a goal and added five assists to
lead his team in the category with
15. Don Borges and Butch Marino
both finished the year with 23
goals (fourth in MILL) and 32
points (sixth), to lead his team
offensively. john Wilson also had
32 points for the Bulls (17 goals,
15 assists), and Brian Nikula
added 31 points (18-13).

Borges said the Saints have a
lot of momentum right now. “I
don't think there’s anybody who
can beat us right now. We won

Detroit twice. if we were in the

COUGH STUDY
Children’s Hospital

The ENT Department is conducting a
study of coughing patterns in adult
(>18 yrs) patients with recent onset

coughs (8-24 hrs). Thirty healthy
adult patients with cough due to a
cold will be studied. For 48 hours, the
enrolled patients will remain in their
home and wear a microphone
which broadcasts cough sounds to
a tape recorder. Patients may not
take medication or leave their
home for 48 hours but are otherwise
unrestricted in their activities.
Patients will be reimbursed a total of
$300.00 for completing the study.
For more information call Children's
Hospital at o<?2—o%l .
