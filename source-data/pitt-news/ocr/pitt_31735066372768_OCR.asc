Speakers Forum To Discuss Aid

By JEFF nuséett —

The Reagan Administration has
proposed a 50 percent cutback in
student aid programs for fiscal year
l983.  million students will be
entirely out of student aid pro-
grams. That’s nearly it of all col-
lege students nationwide,”

‘iaccording to Connie Kreischer,
head of the Student ‘Government
Board’s Governmental Relations
Committee. .

With those facts in, mind, the
SGB’s Task Force on Student Aid
has planned a speaker’s forum for
Friday at noon in room 120, David
Lawrence. , ‘

According to Kreischer, the
forums purpose “is to educate stu-
dents on the proposed cuts in fed-
eral student aid programs and to let

elected ‘officials know that students
are opposed to the cuts.”

All Pittsburgh area elected offi-
cials have been invited-to speak at
the forum. Those planning to
speak so far are Alleheny County
Commissioner and Democratic
candidate for US. Senator Cyril
Wecht, U.S. Representatives Wil-
liam,,Coyne and Doug ,Walgren,
State Representative Frank Pistella
and State Senator Jim Romanelli.

Kreischer hopes that the forum
will affect the students here at Pitt.
“It definitely willraise political
awareness," she said. Kreischer
also said that “it should lead to
higher voter registration and a
higher voter turnout among stu-
dents,” and that itishould “make
students aware that‘ they can have
an effect.” .

“A lot of students want to fight

«the cuts, but not many know the
facts about them," Kreischer said.
In order to inform the students,
Kreischery<)lL.ttiteeretl the follow-
ing facts on the cuts in student aid.

Regarding the Pell Grant (for-
merly BEOG) Program, Kreischer
said th;i,t the program is proposed
to be cut by ~10 percent this year.
“Virtually no one with a parental
income over $14,000 will get a Pell

Grant,” Kreischer said.

Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants (Sl£OG’s) and

State Student Incentive Grants are _

proposed to be eliminated. This
proposal would cut 900,000 stu-

"dents from these grants, according

to Kreischer.

The Reagan Administration is
also proposing that the National
Direct Student Loan (NDSL) Pro-
gram never receive an increase in

funding during Reagan’s tenure in

office: According to Kreischer, the "

Administration believes that
repayments on these loans will
keep the program afloat. .

Kreischer also said that the Col-
lege Work/Study Program is slated
by Reagan to receive a 27 percent
cut in funding. “This cut would
eliminate 250,000 jobs,” she said.

Regartling the TRIO program,
which supplies aid to the very
‘poor. Kreischer said that Reagan
wants 2150 percent cutback-from
$150 million to $75 million-for
fiscal year 

Finally, Kreischer discussed the
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
Program, which she says Reagan
wants to change drastically. He
wantsto make four basic changes
in the program: First, Reagan pro-'

When asked what college stu-

student loans, Pittsburgh National
Bank Senior F.conomist.. Stuart

Hoffman said that students will

have to. start thinking of their col-
lege education in terms of income
potential. g
“Students must ask themselves if
their income would be greatly
enhanced by a college degree. If so,
one alternative would be to borrow
money from a bank. Where is it
written ., that the government
should pay for higher education?”

His reply drew immediate reac-
tions from the other two panelists,

bqonergygand United Steelworkers of
‘America President Lloyd McBride.

“I take it then, that you think
higher education" is a private good

\

 

rather than a public good that will
eventually benefit many people,”
said Heilbroner, the main speaker
of the symposium by Pitt and the

where are students going to get the

 country will not be better
off‘ if higher education becomes
affordable to those students from
an upper class background," said
McBride. “Building minds is as
important a government priority
as building defense."

Heilbroner said he believes that
‘the Reagan admin.istrat.ion’s cur-

»rent economic policies could possi-

bly bring'.on a severe recession or
worse, a financial crisis in which

cretlit or the stock market could

completely collapse.

“There is an inordinate amount

Scheniley Room Reconstructed
I   . . s am

By CAROL KROWITZ

Most students, native Pitts-
burghers and others have enjoyed
.tlie lush and expansive Schenley
Park and visited the Fort Pitt

Blockhouse at Point State Park in-

dowiitowii Pittsburgh. The 300
acres for a park and the blockhouse
were gifts to the city from Mary
(Iroghan-Schenley, a colorful and
generous 19th century Pittsburgh
heiress whose life was filled with
wealth, drama and scandal.

Through the efforts and determi-
nation of a group of dedicated indi-
viduals, Pitt has its own reminder
of Mary Schenley. a part of her
home--the Croghan—Schenley
ballroom. The tooth has been
reconstructed on the first floor of
the Cathedral and is shown in con-

.junction with the Nationality

Rooms.

_In 1830, Schenley came with her
father, William (lroghan, ]r., a
revolutionary ‘war colonel and
wealthy lawyer. to Pittsburgh from
Kentucky where Croghan’s young
wife and infant son had died. A
large portion of Schenley's wealth
came from her mother's side of the
family. Her mother was an
O'Hara, daughter of‘ General
James O’Hara who caine from Ire-
land and transformed Pittsburgh
from a wilderness to a city of iiidus-
try and commerce. His business
enterprises included glass, salt,
lumber, iron, a taniiery, gristmill,
international shipping and
building.

Schenley's paternal grandfather

was‘Major William Croghan, Sr.
who owned vast portions of land
stretching from Kentucky to west-
"ern Pennsylvania. He is most noted

A for commanding the troops at Fort

Pitt in 178?»; r
Upon arriving fin Pittsburgh,
Schenley's father created a struc-

l

\

   
   

ture on Black Horse Hill, now
Stanton Heights. Sending his iiiiie—
year-old daughter off to boarding
schools, (Iroghan worked on his
inagnificient home.constructing it
in the Greek Revival architectural
style. This t pe of architecture-—

a rog at)-Schenley

patterned alter the elauorate stone
and marble of ancient Greek archi-
tecture was executed in wood and
plaster, with oriiately carved
friezes, columns and pilasters.

According to E. Maxine Bruhns,

director of the Nationality Rooms .

Program at the University of Pitts-
burgh, the (lroghan-Schienley ball-
room is a superb example of HMS
type of architecture.

“Some of the bestexamples of.
Greek Revival style were in Wes-
tern Pemisylvaiiia in the early-
l83()’s,” Bruhns said. “It reflects
the taste and deteriiiination of early
Pittsburghers to bring culture to
the town, and this was one means
of doing it. Itis a fine representa-
tion of the architecture which de-
veloped iii Westen Pennsylyatiia

during the period of early affluent
America." ' '

(Iroghan , was deterriiined to
provide his daugliter with a home
filled with entertainment and joy,
thus he named the mansion “Pic-
nic_House". The elegant ballroom
was the greatest manifestation of
his dream with its exquisitely
carved (Iorinthian capitals, free
standing columns, mirrored walls
and marble fireplace. Hanging
from the ceiling was a crystal and

bronze chandelier cut by Williaii.‘
liichbaum, glassciitier to France's

_Kiiig Louis XVI, who came from
France to work in the Pittsburgh
()’Hara glass plant. (Iroghan
looked forward to his daughter's
societal debut. Butrunbeknowst to
him, his "daughter was making
other plans. -

In I8-ll, while away at school i-n
New Brighton, Staten Islatid, she
had met a man through the inter-
vention of the school‘s head mis-
tress. Knowing that (‘.roghan’s
daughter was soon to be introduced
into societyiand would have many
suitors, the head mistress arranged
to have her brother-in-law meet the
Pittsburgh heiress. A year later, th”
15-year-old eloped ‘with the 43-
year-old, twice widowed, B'ritish
captain, Edward Harrington
Schenley. This was the t'hird elope-
ineiit for the captain.

The runaway marriage caused a
sensation between -continents.
(Iroghan was said to be devastated.
He immediately stopped construc-
tion on “Picnic House" and threat-.
cited to exclude his daughter from
his will. In England, Queen Victo-
ria allegedly refused an audience to
the “disobedient girl from Pitts-
burgh.” The response closer to,
home was that Schenley’ was a
lecherous fortune hunter.

The promotional show was
‘organized by Pitt student Matt

Anzalone. a Peters Township
resident who performs an open-

Comedy Club. Originally from
Brooklyn, N.Y. and a loriner
music -major at West Virginia
University, Anzalone combines

, music and comedy in his act.

His musical talents and hu-
morous verses blended with
witty lmpersonations made
him the favorite at the Portfo-

an epgore at the end of the
evening. -

“I’ve also ‘done some serious

The couple eventually settled
and began to raise’ their family.
The years passed and Croghan,
lonely but hopeful that his daugh-
ter would return, resumed work on

the house, adding 29 rooms, a cor_i- »

servatory and stables. After several
years, in 1848, Schenley did return
to Pittsburgh with her husband,
three children and a retiriue of Eng-
lish servants. They did not stay for
long and nearly a year later, in
1849, they went back to England.

». Stshenley was never again to return

"to the palatial “Picnic House"
which was built especially for her.

In 1850, Croghan died, ’ andg
Schenley received her enormous
inheritance. She maintained “Pic-
nic House" throughout the many

- years, but it was lived in only by a
caretaker. When her husband died
after 36 years of marriage, Schenley
began liquidation of her vast estate
which took nearly 50 years. “Picnic
House”, the final piece of proper-
ty left, was sold to developer Wil-
liam S. Miller in 1945.

Shortly thereafter, the home was
to be demolished to make way for a

housing project. But because of its" .

sessing exceptional historic and
architectural interest and worthy of
preservation." Plans were,made to
dismantle. rebuild and preserve the
elaborate ballroom. Although the
New York Metropolitan Museum
of Art expressed an‘ interest in
obtaining it, a group of Pitts-
burghers were not about to let it

leave their city and began raising.

V funds for the preservation.

Funds came primarily from
George Hubbard Clapp, former
chairman of the Pitt Board of Trus-
tees, who donated $50,000 to the
project, and the ballroom was
rebuilt in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. But a great deal of refurbish-

ing had to be done, and money was, .

not readilyavailable. For 30 yearsit

remained in storage, until a recent .

grantifrom the A.W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust was
received.

The grant has enabled the pur-
chase of fine period draperies,
mahogany furniture and
improved lighting. The restored
columns and pilasters are regal.
The white oak floor is the original
one placed in the ballroom by
Croghan in the unfulfilled hope
of seeing his daughter dance upon
ll. ‘

The ballroom can be viewed by
appointment through the Nation-
ality Rooms Program at x6000.

Heinbroner offers two solutions
to what he sees as impending disas-
‘ter with the current economic poli-
cies. The first would involve taking
steps to trim military Spending,
lower interest rates, initiate a fed-
eral support system to the nation's
cities, andcancel the tax cuts; while
the second would avoid. the easy
cures and set up an economy with
complicated, detailed ceilings and
controls on wages and prices.
McBride said that he is “not
*optiniis,tic”" about the country's
economic future. Citing statistics
from a recent New York Times arti-
cle, McBride said that the utiliza-
tion of industrial capital has
moved downward from 80 percent

OCCUT.

  Retirement  

The early retirement incentive plan adopted by Pitt‘s
board of trustees last week is good policy for both univer-
sity administrators distressed over declining enrollments
and decreasingirevenues as well as faculty members who
have witnessed a slowlturnoverin their ranks.

The plan is especially noteworthy, however, for the- fact
that Pitt administrators and faculty have finally arrived at
a concrete measure that should trim the faculty in a 1
humane and considerate way. In fact, administrators may
be ableito kill two birds with one stone if they happen to
discover a department that needs dismantling with most
faculty .members eligible for the early retirement plan.

We doubt, however, that. administrators could step into
such a fortuitious situation,andeven if they did, it would
cause us to suspect the administration’s motives behind its
approvaltof the plan. - _ 3'

About 200 of Pitt’s 1,200 full-time tenured faculty will
be eligible for the plan, as long as they are betweenthe ages
of 62 and 69 and have at least. 10 years of service with the

. , university. Begifnningjuly l, and continuing for five- . i‘
, — years until 1987, the university will pay early retirees from
2 .03 to 50 percent of their current yearly-salary for every year
of‘ their retirement until they reach 70, not to exceed
$25,000 a year. In addition. the early retirees will also
continue to receive coverage under Pitt's health, life insur-
ance and annuity plansand enjoy free tuition for their

children and spouses. "

_ That’s not all the package of goodies contains for early

retirees. If4—or when-—their colleagues who are still work-

. ing get a salary increase, that same percentage increase

will be reflected in the retirees payments, with a limit of

The retirement plan benefits both the university and the
retirees. This, '-most likely, is why there was consensus for __
the plan, albeit long in coming, among both faculty and
administrators. Usually it’s tough enough for the faculty
to agree amongst themselves on something—-witness the
curriculum reform debate—-—let alone agree on something
with administrators.

 0' A In a sense, negotiations surrounding the early retire-‘
ment plan have been similar to those involved with a bill
debated in the U .S. Congress: the proposal goes before the -
House and Senate as well as joint committees before both
sides agree,_and itis sent to the president, in this case, the
board of trustees, for final approval.

.Crucial to the overall success of ‘the retirement; plan is
the university’s commitment not to replace more than 65
percent of the faculty who take advantage of the plan, thus
assuring that the university will ‘break even.

A While commitment such as»that and other forms of
bureaucratic rhetoric contained in the trustees’ resolution
may have the potential for misapplication, or even worse,-
inexecution, we are confident that Pitt’s faculty will make
an effort to monitor the admin'istration’spverall commit-
ment to the plan. Y 

Part of this monitoring function would include pre-
venting cases of subtle coercion where apotentially eligi-
ble retiree is pressured into retirement simply to fill his
spot or to cut short that professor’s tenure. This is a
far-fetched scenario, however, and we. hope that the uni-
versity setting would be the last place for such an event to

/

T With conscientious monitoring of commitments made
. by both faculty and administrators, reduction of bureau-
cratic hassles normally associated withiretirement plans
and freedom of choice in the decision to retire, the early
retirement incentive plan should accomplish its goals in a
benevolent and ethical way. g
Theearly retirement incentive plan is good university
policy, and it is also a good example of what the-faculty
and the administration can accomplish when working
together in a productiveatmosphere.

Why does all this talk about
keeping this country “one of the
greatest in “the world" (March 5th
letter from Allen jones, “Whatever
Happened to Patriotic Spirit.?")
keep showing up on Tl1ePitt News
opinion page and elsewhere? Are
we in a beauty contest? A football
match? Are we trying to amass the
most destructive weaponry" ever
known while achieving the highest
standard of living at the expense of
people in other countries? In what
sense are we being “one of the
greatest?" Couldn't we settle for
being a good neighbor that doesn't
poke its no_se (or CIA)'into places
where it doesn't belong? '

lies have left the country and are a

0 was raised to believe is the

into El Salvador ‘ to
finance the operations of their
“death squads.” Thesegroups are
responsible for 80 percent of the
killing in the country; most of their
victims-are simple peasants or per-
sons who advocate reform of the
system. Besides the death squads,

the poeple also have much to fear

from the military itself. Units of
the Salvadorean Army embark on
“search and destroy” missions
reminiscent of US. tactics in Viet-
nam: this is not surprising'because—

‘ their army is trained and equipped

with US. money. It seems that the
U.S. government has a very short
memory: the entire situation in El
‘Salvador seems like Vietnam dur-
ing the 19505 and early 1960s.
Reagan has recently stated that
the junta and its military have
‘made significant “progress" in the
area of political and human rights.
This‘ “progress", if permitted to

grow, will destroy the country. For’

example, in March 1980, Archbi-
shop Oscar Anulfo‘ Romero was
murdered while celebrating‘ Mass
in the cathedral of San Salvador;
major demonstrations by the peo-
ple afterwards were brutally
crushed by the government——
hundreds of people were killed in
the streets. In December 1980, three
American nuns and a la_y worker
were stopped at an army roadblock;
their raped and mutilated bodies
were found later in shallow graves
-by the road. U.S. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig spec_ulated.,that

they may have attempted to run the ‘

roadblock. This assumption is
absolutely ridiculous; to this day
nothing has been done to punish
the persons responsible (or their
government). Several weeks ago,
an elite unit'of the Salvadorean
Army attacked a village in helicop-
ters, raped the women and girls,
murdered almost 900 persons, and
burned the village to the ground.
The junta then tried to insinuate
that it was a guerrilla attackll. This

is an absolutely outrageous’

assumption for several reasons but
it was given credence by the U.S.:
firstly, it is common knowledge
that the guerrillas do not possess
helicopters or equipment such as
the attacking troops had; secondly,
no guerrilla is about to attack the
very people whose plight gives his
movements legitimacy. Then,
recently, Salvadorean Army troops
seized persons in a working-class
district in San Salvador, raped the
women and young girls, and shot
twenty persons in‘the streets. Wit-
nesses and relatives of the victims
identified the perpetrators as
government troops; the junta
stated» that thefvictims were“subver-

sives." The word “subversives" has"

a quite broad defintion in this
country: it means anyone who is
opposed to the brutal U.S.-backed
violence of the government- ,

supporter of freedom and human
rights onearth, going to continue
this brutal Hitlerian oppression ih
this small country? Make no mis-
take, it is up to the USA: we can
stop this holocaust. .
Reagan and I-Iaig contend that
these measures are necessary to pre-
vent the expansion of Communism
in Central America. Those who
have studied the principles of
Communism know that its teach-
ings attract popular support in
countries where ;a large sector of the
population is denied the means to»)
rise above subsistence level by a.
numerically insignificant group of
tyrannical landlords and capital-

'ists. In El Salvador the right-wing_. ;
families, which compose 2 percentifi‘

of the _total population, own
almost 70 percent of the farmland.
The majority of peasants own
nothing and are forced to work
under terrible conditions for
meager wages. The Reagan admin-
istration is dedicated to usingour
tax dollars to support these rich
"families (who obviously will stop
at nothing to protect their inter-
ests) and their allies in the Salva-
doren junta and army in keeping
the peasants and common people
in total poverty and terror: is it any
wonder that these people are turn-
ing to Communists for help?
When the peopleof a country
such as El Salvador see their chil
ren being killed, their daughter;
and mothers being violated, and
‘scores of other atrocities being per-
petrated by troops who are dressed
‘in U.S.-made military fatigues,
who shoot them with U.S.-made
weapons, and who attack them in
U.S.-made helicopters, who will
these people think is their real
‘enemy? If our country really stands
for what our Founding Fathers
intended, then what in the hell are
we doing to the people of El
Salvador? _ " '

  Greek Week:  
“Greeks Growing  tron

This year Pitt’s fraternities and sorori-
ties are working hard to raise $50,000 for
“ the Arthritis Foundation during the
annual Greek Charity, Drive, A “Greek
Growing Stronger For Arthritis."

, You might have seen the commercial
on W: Jim Wallender, a Pitt fraternity
member, holding the hand of Becky, a
six-year-old girl with arthritis, while
informing the audience of the effects of
arthritis. . ' .

, Wallender isn’t,alone in his effort to
raise $50,000‘for the Arthritis Founda-

tion. He has the 13.Pitt fraternities and 1 2
sororities backing ‘him. ‘

limited to the seven days of Greek Week
(March 20-27), but the ﬁnal fund raising

— events take place during this time.

Dan Saint and Jamie Messino, the
Over-all Chairpersons for Greek Week,
along with approximately 90 committee
chairpeople, planned all of the 1982
Greek Week festivities. A ~ 2

The fraternities and sororities began

their activities in January with the Charity

Kick-off.

"This year we had a giant twister game '

in which two members from each frater-
nity and. sorority participated,-” said
Saint.

The Greeks have also,had three bloodl

.points to each,”

which takes ,l

drives, one on,Jan. 142-15, anothergon
Feb. 4-5, and the third on Mar. 15-16.

“We’ re the largest source of blood_for
the Pittsburgh Blood Bank, which serves
33 hospitals,” saidSaint.

[During the Charity Drive, fraternities
and sororities are placed into matched

J __groups in order to have a fair competi-

tion; that way a sorority -with 50
members won’t ‘be competing against a
different sorority with'only"20 members.
Approximately four sororities and frater-
nities are grouped together according to
their size, commented Messino.

Each charity event ' during Greek
Week is worth a certain amount of points
and the goal of a fraternity and sorority is

V to win the overall trophy which goes to

the group which has the most points at
the end of Greek Week a ”

“We (the chairpeople) ranked what we
felt was the’ leastimportant and most
important event and then we assigned
said iMessino.
“Charity—t_he reason why we ‘have’
Greek Week——is the most important, so
that is worth 20 points."

Greek Sing, a competition in which

individual fraternities and sororities ‘perv
T form a song and dance routine, is con-

sidered to be the second most important
event and is worth 10 points. Less than
10 points are assigned to the least
important events.

This year the _Greek Sing took place
on Feb. 27, in the Syria Mosque and the
winners were Delta Delta Delta and-FlJl.

“Greek Sing is the only event where
the winners are anno\unced before the
end of Greek Week because it’s so com-
petitive that people get kind of edgy,"
said Messino. '

Wednesday, Mar. 17, is “tag day.” Fra- .

ternity and sororitylmembers have a per-
mit to legally “can” (collect money in
cans) downtown on this ‘day. i

“This year what we did was section off
the whole city and every group has an
assigned area whichthey have to cover,"
Messino said.

There are two events scheduled for
the official beginning of Greek Week on
Mar. 20, the Ten Kilometer Run in
Schenley Park and a Dance-a-thon.

. The Ten Kilometer Run (6.2 miles)
“Greek Week Schenley Park Fun Run"
will begin at 9 a.m. in Schenley Park.

One free entrant is allowed to partici-
pate from each fraternity and sorority,
but additional entrants are charged-$5.‘

Any full- or part-time» Pitt student can
register by pickingup a release form in

the lnterfraternity Council Ofﬁce -and

paying a $6 fee. , .

Eight trophies will be awarded to 

winners:

0 Male and female first-place winners

. (2). .

0 Male and female second-place
winners (2) . J

0 Male and female third-place winners
(2) r P

0 Male and female .ﬁrst-place Greek

The Dan‘ce-a“-tl‘ion will take place on

 

Saturday Mar. 20 at 6 p.m. until Sunday I ,

Mar.’ 21 at 6 p.m. at the Jewish Com-
munity Center in Oakland. There will be ‘ 

dancing‘ for 24 hours,and’a ‘DJ"from1
96KX will be present.

The Dance-a-thon. is/"open to every-
one, but at |east3,one dancer must be a

' Pitt student and-‘each couple must have

51 O0‘ in sponsors. Prizes will be donated
by McDonalds and 96KX during the
event ' ‘

Spectators will be charged a 25¢ fee.
A banner competition will take place

- at the Dance-a-thon. Banners must be

the size of one king-size sheet and will be
judged on portrayal of theme, artwork,

,originality and overall appearance. 

A Greek House and Calendar Deco-
rating Contest will also take place ‘on
Sunday, with the best decorated frater-
nity or sorority living facility winning
points. '

The next event is the Chariot Race
which will take place on Monday, Mar. 22
at noon on Bigelow Boulevard. Each
Matched group of fraternities and sorori-
ties must buildla Chariot and decorate it.
The Greek Weekltheme “GreeksrGrow-
ing Stronger For Arthritis" and the
Arthritis Foundation name, along with
the group’s Greek letters, must be visible
on the chariot. ’

" Another event scheduled for Greek
Week is Talent Night, which will take
place on Mar. 23, at 8 p.m. in David

P , Lawrence Auditorium.

“Girls and guys can-do anything for
their performance on Talent'l‘light, but
we usually get a lot of comical song and
dance routines," said Messino.

The Greeks are judged on creativity,
costumes and props‘,_staging, lighting

' and sound, participation, theme an

timing.

. Much more work goes into the acts 
Greek Sing than in Talent Night, accord-
ing to Saint.

On Wednesday, Mar. 24, the annual

 Pitt -News, Wednesday,_M'arch 17, 1982

‘V

Greek Mixer will take place in the Syria
Mosque at 9 p.m. '

 “This is a very large party thrown for all

Greeks," said Saint. "

The DJ, John Bushko, will play a var-
iety of music and requests.

Fun night, another festivity planned"

for Greek Week, will take place on the
Cathedral lawn and inside Soldier’s and
Sailor’s immediately before the mixer.

' Some examples of games that will- take
. place are: a tug-of.-war, an obstacle

course and a timed human-pyramid
building contest W‘

Greek Week comes to a close with the

\ Greek Formal on Saturday night, Mar.

27,fat the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel from 8

if  to 1 am.

“That's when all the trophies are given
out and weﬂﬁnd out who won the Charity
Drive,” said Messino. - "

That is also when all of the fraternities
and sororities discover whether or not
theyrhave reached their‘$50,000 goal for
the beneﬁt of the Arthritis Foundation.

According to Saint, a few changes
were made for this year's Greek Week;
“We added the 10 kilometer run, in

\

Schenley Park, scheduled Greek Sing a
few weeks earlier, made Talent Night
more professional and took out some

unnecessary games in Fun Night.

“This year, the jmain difference in
Greek Week is that we’re concentrating
on community relations and trying to get
the community more aware of the good
things the Greeks do,” Saint said.

“There’s more to GreekiWeek than
just the individual events,” Saint said.
“Every night of Greek Week, there’s a
Greek mixer at a different fraternity. lt’s a

- time that the Greek system becomes
really‘ close to one another to raise -
a money for the charity.” .

ln addition to the scheduled events,

_each fraternity and sorority sets up their

own charitable functions. Forexample,
the Pi”l.ambda Phi fraternity had a bas-
ketball” bounce for 50 hours in down-

, town ‘Pittsburgh.

”The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity ran
from here to the Penn State chapter car-
rying the game ball for the Pitt-Penn
State game,” Saint said. ’

“We really enjoy Greek Week And,

V what we enjoy about it is being able to

help the Arthritis Foundation," Saint
said. ’ . ~ -'

1 Ten Pitt Lady Panther,
swimmers are in Austin, Texas
competing in the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) National Swirn-
ming Championships today’
through Saturday at the University
of Texas campus. The number of

. swimmers is the most the Lady

Panther swim team has ever
fielded, although there were ten
participants—nine swimmers and
a diver-_-last year.

Performing well in Nationals is
a. goal every swimmer yearns for-
from the‘ first lap of training, and
Pitt first-year Coach Dave Belo-
wich is going into the meet with
the ‘same enthusiam as his
swimmers.

“This is it; Nationals is what we
have looked toward all season,‘-
Belowich said. “Striving for All-
America honors is something I’m
ernphasizindg to the swimmers.”

To Amy Jackson, the meet takes
on additional meaning. Besides
being the last meet of her-career,

into the consolation round against
Chris Mondragon of North Carol-
ina State. .

Jelic blanked Mondragon, 5-9 to
move into the second round of Con-

. solation against Bill Dykeman of

Louisiana State University.

Jelic fought hard, barely missing

several takedowns throughout the
match, but with only 10 seconds
left, Jelic was‘ trailing 5-4. He tried
a desperation move but came away

7 emptyhanded, giving up a take- _~
down to make the final score 7-4.

-It was a ‘heart-breaking loss for
Jelic; a victory would-have assured

. him at leastan eighth-place finish

and All-America status. Dykeman
went to place sixth in the
tournament. ’

Jelic, rated 18th_ in the nation
prior to the tournament, ended his

season with an impressive 19-4-1 ~

record. ,
Haines’ 7-7-2 record forced him

into the “pigtail” round, which

School coach Jim Lankster had it

his way Bryan Mitchell would be
singing the praises of Tennessee.

1 If Pitt coach Roy Chipman had
it his way, Bryan Mitchell would be
donning the‘blue- and- gold of the
Pitt Panthers.

“Bryan has already made a ver-
bal commitment to Tennessee.”

‘Lankster said yesterday about his

star player.

“‘I don’t really" believe much in
verbal commitments. Two days
after the verbal commitment, Mit-
chell called Tennesee telling them
he was still interested «in Pitt,”

Chipman said. “Besides, his high ’

school coach is a big Tennesee
man.” A

The object of all the attention,
Mitchell was nominated as one of
the five best high school players in
Kentucky. He is a shoe-in for first-
team All-State honors.

‘«‘He’s a l)lli€ chipper,” Lankster
said matter of factly.
, “Brvan Mitchell-can'play,” Pitt
Asststant Coach Reggie Warford
sa'id.

Can he ever.‘ The 6-5 guard-'

forward played for tiny Lexington
Catholic High School, but his sta-
tistics weren’t. tiny. Mitchell ‘aver-
aged 20 points a game while
pulling down 12 rebounds agame.
Mitchell did that a lot of times from
the point guard position. He also
played V forward and shooting
guard. He also has a 41-inch verti-
cal leaps .

“Bryan Mitchell can play for-
ward and guard. He’s very versa-
tile,” Chipman said.

Though Mithchell figures to be
anroffensive threat, Chipman must
be envisioning the 6-5 High School
senior, at the point of his 1-3-1 trap
zone. v

Mitchell quickness f‘lrst attracted
the Pitt coaches, as did his height.

'‘‘One of the problems we had
this year was that our point man in
the zone was short. Nowhere was
this more obvious than in the Pep-
perdine game," Warford said.

’Mitchell’s J cision might be
affected by two .visits this week.
Today.Tennesee coaches w_1ll pay

on Thursday.

Mitche1l’s interest in Pitt,
besides the fact that the Panthers

' have made a big step up by joining

the Big East, may well be attributed
to Panther freshman and Louis-
ville native‘:’Chip Watkins.

“Chip and Bryan are very good
friends. They played together in
All-Star camp,” Warford said.

But as Warford added, Mitchell
decision will not be affected by
friendship, but by preferences. And

right now, it’s Pitt and Tennessee,

down to the wire. . ,,

it it =|l=

While Bryan Mitchell is a chief
concern of the Pitt coaching staff,
the biggest worry is grabbing a cen-
ter. Although the crop of high
school centers is thin this year, Pitt
has an eye on Iowa-native Tom"
Faber. So does Drake and
Colorado.

“Tom is a 6-9 andgoes about 235
to 240, but he’s a little slow right
now, although we feel that could
be worked on,” Warford said, in
assesing Faber.

“Faberis a good offensive player,
but he’s not really playing against

the kind of competition we’d likefjgtr‘ 7

him to play againstﬁ’ Warford
added. . '

Faber, along with Clairton’s
Moore seem to be Pift’s top center
prospects—new prospects that is. A
familiar name might be headed
back to Pitt.

Paul Brozovich, who flunked
out Pitt last year, may return to
Oakland. Brozovich wentto a jun-
ior college in California, where he
didn’t.’play basketball, but grew an
inch to 6-1 1. Centers that big don’t
come along every day. '

“Paul has to re-apply at Pitt. He
has to go through admissions pro-
cess and if he gets in there is a good
chance that he might be ba‘ck"§
Warford said. 7 .

Looking at Lisa Shirk’s fresh,

seem that she would have a hard
enough time walking, let alone
performing gymnastics at all this
season. Through daily treatments,
great effort, and the right mental

Spikers Finish 2nd in Tourney

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt men’s volleyball team
proved they are a contender and no
longendesire to take a backseat in
the East, as they finished second at
the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League mid-season tohrnament.

The Panthers also chalked up
one league ivictory defeating Army
Sunday and came close to upset-

ting Eastern power Rutgers-
Newark in a very close match
Friday.

The Pitt spikers started off their

busy weekend losing to the tall and M
high-leaping Rutgers squad, 15-

13,13-15, 15-17, and 13-15.

In a match that couldn’t have
been any closer, it was the excellent
playby the Panthers, especially on
defense, that kept Pitt in the match

before the Scarlet Knights escaped ~

with a difficult victory.

. "Everyone played extremely
well,” said Pitt Head Coach Ray
Reilly. “I moved Barry Goldberg to
the middle and he was a strong fac-
tor. He"fi1l‘ed the gap so I could
move Bill Knuth to the outside.

“Rutgers is a very tall team and
they’re great leapers. We were dig-
ging more because they were'hit-
ting over a lot of our blocks.”

Qn Saturday, the Panthers tra-
veled to West Point for the ECVL
open tournament. .

_ On their way to a second-place
finish in the 12-team field, the
Panthers placed first in their pool
of four teams, racking up victories
over the University of Pennsylva-
nia,'l5-6, 15-1, Cornell, 15-0, 15-2,-
and Albany State. 15-5, 15-3.

The top two teams from the three
pools entered the playoffs, with the

top two teams getting by in the first’

round. At this point, the Panthers
were the No. 1’ seed, ahead of
Rutgers, Newark.

In the semi-finals the Pitt spikers ‘

faced George Mason,and the
Panthers, out for revenge for a
recent league loss, beat George
_Mason, 15-1 and 15-9.

 National   League East: Montreal Expos‘ Country

Editor’s note: This is the first of a

major league baseball pennant
races. '

By FREDERICK BEERS _ _ .
R.-_N'qrth of the border. 'l‘bat’s
where the strength in this division
lies. .

For three years the prize of a '

National League pennant has

eluded the Montreal, Expos, but

this year they should snatch up that
prize.

Few‘ things have changed from

' last year"s 'squad that should have

taken. the pennant——except thatthe

' team -is a year more experienced.

That should make the difference in
1982. t . ’ " 4
On the mound and at the plate
the Expos are as solid as anyone.
Defensively, ‘except for golden
\glove’rs Gary Carter behind the

plate and Andre Dawson in center-»

» field; the Expos are fair.
The pitching rotation will come
almost exclusively from the right
side andvwill be led by Steve Rog-
ers, followed by Ray Burris,-Bill
Gullikson, Scott Sanderson, Char-
lie Lea, and David Palmer. “Space-
man” lefty Bill Lee and Stan
Bahnsen can start also, or work as
relievers‘ along with ancient

_ Woody Fryman-(lefty), disgruntled

‘Elias Sosa, and newly-acquired
fireballer Jeff Reardon._ ‘
P‘ The outfield will feature Daw-
son, speedster Tim Raines in left,
while Terry Francona and Tim
Wallach vie for the job inrright.
Warren Cromartie will be at first
base and Larry Parrishyat third,
while second and short will go to

newcomer Wallace Johnson,» Chris
Spier, "and Rodney Scott. ‘

If pitc-hing didn't count, the St.
Louis Cardinals mighfvery well be
among the elite of baseball.

That,.of course, is nothing new.

The Cardinals always seem to be-

lacking in pitching and loaded in
their places. This could change as
the Cards have been very active dur-
ing the off-‘season.

This season's staff will consist of _

righthande_rs Bob Forsch, Steve.
Mufa, Joaquin Andujar, and
promising Andv Rinco, as well as
lefties John Martin and Dave
'LaPoint. ‘
St. Louis will again be strong
offensively and on the basepaths.
T hencorpf of established hitters
include Keith Hernandez at first,
Ken Oberkfell at third, Garry Tem-
pleton at short, newly-acquired

centerfielder Lonnie Smith, right- '

fielder George Hendrick, and part-

Along with secondbaseman -

Tom'my Herr; all of theabove are

basestealing threats except Hen-

drick and Iorg. I S , _
Catcher Darrell Porter, coming

off a bad year in ’8l , will be counted g

on heavily.

’ Whitey Herzog is a fine manager
and should move the Cardinalsup
in their division. \ _

In Pittsburgh, there are a lot of
question marks. Will Dave Parker
remain a Pirate? Will a sore-armed
staff -heal before theyear is lost?
Who will get the starting jobs at
second and short? Will Chuck

The Pitt indoor soccer club fin-
ished strong, but their efforts were
too late. The Panthers failed to
make the final four in the Grove
City Indoor Invitational, and thus

succeeded in making an unwanted ‘

early exit. i
With the I2-team field divided
into two pools, the Pitt booters
competed in the tougher bracket,
according to Pitt Head Coach Leo
Bemis. .
In the Panthers’ first game, they
ed host Grove City. Besides bat-

} Airing the vocal crowd, the Pitt

squad had to battle a prepared and
patient Grove City team.

“We acted like we "forgot how to
play," said Bemis. “Grove City had
the crowd support. I They just
stayed back and played defense.”

With a scoreless first half, a rarity
in indoor soccer, the Panthers took
a l—0‘lead in the second half, but
eventually lost 2-1 on the only
penalty kick in the tournament.

The Panthers’ next foe was Fre-
donia State of New York,‘last year's
tournament champion. Pitt lost to

' them in last year’s final and history’

repeated as Pitt lost again 3-0.

G ....f‘It was a well-contested game,"

"'ernis said. “It was fairly even and
the game was closer‘ than the score
indicates.

Next, the Pitt. booters faced
Alderson-Broadis, the Wheeling
Tournament champion. The

I Panthers improved their play/and

were leading the predominately
British squad, 1-0 with a few mm-
utes left. But, according to Bemis, it

‘ was the inexperience of the young

The Pitt News,iiWednesday, l\/Iarch 17, 1982’

r

Pitt players (seven freshman) that
caused them ‘to relax and allow
A8cB to score quick goals to bea
Pitt, 2-]. '
With three early losses, the
Panthers had no hopes of making
the finals. Their play kept improv-
ing steadily throughout the day,

but victory kept sliding through-

their fingers. They were out to win

and _w_in they did. i
Youngstown"

Panthers’ first

the
the

State was
victim, as

Panther squad tired out the YSU,

squad, winning 5-2.

p Indiana State of Pennsylvania
(IUP) had been giving teams trou-
ble all day, with their scoring ace
Tony Chibouki ripping shots into
the nets.

But the Panthers were on a roll.
They avenged their outdoor season
loss to IUP by defeating them to
4-0, and allowing Chibouki only
two shots on goal.

“It was a beautiful game,” said,

Bemis. “Our plan was to play Chi-
bouki tight and that we did. All the
gl_1Y5 Played veryvwelll Dave Ghila-
ma had some nice saves for its in
goal.”

The Pitt scoring was led by fresh-
man Jim Steele, with four goals,
followed by junior John Hagen-
buch with three goals and sopho-

' more Gerry Wasson and freshman

Gary Gaido, Paul Navaro, and

Sparky Lucke, ‘with’ one goal each.
The Panther indoor soccer club's
season has come to.an end, with the
Panthers sporting a 20-1 l-4 record.
More impressively the Pitt booters
captured three first-places and one
third-place finish in
tournaments.

“We could have possibly done i

better if I played the best players all
the time, but that’s not our pur-
pose,” said Bemis. “Our goal for

the indoor season is to give every- 

one playing experience. . We
accomplished that. and finished
with a winning season.

“The indoor game is aminiature
version of the outdoor game,”
explained Bemis.’ “In indoor you
get more opportunties to perform
the different skills. It helps the
players improve their skills and it

‘helps them understandeach other

better.” -

Many of the players agree with
Bemis about the benefits of the
indoor season. ' —

“Indoor ‘helps me to work closer
with the other players,” said fresh-

. man Dan Zemanski. “We learn to

play better with each other. It also

-makes me look forward to the out-

door sea-son. We're going to be

' good and competitive.”

“It -brings together players who
will play together in the fall,” said

According to Belowich, the Lady
Panthers could finish as high as
fifth or sixth-place in the nation if
they swim up to their potential, l)ut

“Realistically, a top 10 finish is

for the program to be in the top

Sanft, Shirk needs to especially
concentrate “A little more on

Sanft went so far to call Shirk
one of the “most-talented athletes
who ever attended Pitt.”

Shirk is the only Eastern gym-

Lady Lion team, to recieve a bid to
the national championships. Two
other Pitt gymnasts—¥Gretchen

V “Rutgers played great,” said
Reilly. “They’re a strong team. We
didn’t play poorly mentally, only
physically. We had some bad serv-
ing and our passing was off. We
didn’t play well enough “to beat,-.
them.”
The Panthers had a breather on
Sunday, beating a weak Army team
15-12, 15-8, and 1.3-l2,‘to bring
Pitt’s league record to ‘3-2. . .
“We played really steady. We
made very few errors,” said Reilly.
“Dave Baird, Gary Groshner, Bill

job.” . g S
This weekend the Pitt spikers

The Panthers lost to George
Mason in their first league match
but got revenge with a superior win
over them in the ECVL

According to Reilly, his spikersﬁy

took George Mason too lightly the
first time, but that won't happen
again. '

“We showed George Mason at
the ECVL that we're ready for
them,.” Reilly said.

Reilly was concerned with the
Panthers’ weak mental game in the
early part of the season, but now he
feels the mental game has steadily
improved.

“This weekend we played really
well,” said Reilly. “We’re on the
road back after some tough losses.

“1 think we’ve conquered our
menta_l game problem. The players

decided to relax and have fun out

The bullpen is mannediby veter-

even more questionable after elbow
surgery, and Ron Reed, 39, is fair at
best. Sparky Lyle may retire before
the seasongets underway, while Ed

Philadelphia's batters should
strike a little more fear into the
hearts of opponents than their

their biggest power threat in years.
The once—heralded Mazilli will:

The Mets are certainly improv-

the Cubs? .

The Cubbies made some large
scale changes during the off-
season—new owners, manager,
vice president/general _manager,
and later, players.

With, the front office changes
implemented, the Cubs proceeded
to ship their best pitcher,’ Mike
Krukow, to the Phillies for cather
Kieth Moreland, and hurlers
Dickie Noles and Dan Larson.

They also shipped shortstop
Ivan DeJesus to the City of Broth-
erly Love, for that city’s shortstop,
Larry Bowa, and Ryne Sandberg.

The Cubs also signed free agent

Campbell.

The Cubs only bright spots are‘
first baseman Bill Buckner and left-
fielder Steve Henderson.

Elsewhere, things are up in the
air for the Cubs, unlike season’s
end, when the Cubs will be very
much in the cellar.

- pitchers Ferguson Jenkins and Bill?

junior goalkeeper Jay Hirt. “It _

builds up the team spirit. It helpeﬁﬁg

me because I hadn’t played for

' while and it got me back into

shape.”

Bemis also used the indoor sea-
son to experiment, switching play-
ers to new positions. Gerry Wasson

was one of the player, making the

move from forward,’ an offense
position, to fullback, in
defense, during indoor play.
“Indoor definitely helped tne
out,” said Wasson. “It really
learned a lot about defensive posi-
tion. It got me acquainted with my
new position and helped my tack-
ling ability.” 
According to Bemis, the indoor

' season gives -one very important

the ‘

advantage that is beneficial for 
r if

fall outdoor season.

‘flt really helps when we beat
teams that we lost to in outdoor,”
Bemis said. “It builds up our confi-
dence and we gain respect from the
other team. It gives us a chance to
go at them in the fall with more
confidence.” ‘ -

The indoor season was success-
ful and hopefully helpful for the
Pitt Panthers, as they look forward
to a winning 1982 season.
