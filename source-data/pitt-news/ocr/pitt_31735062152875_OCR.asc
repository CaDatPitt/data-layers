the University, Peabody high school es-
tablished an enviable record by captur-
ing four firsts out of a possible six

entrants, a mark which will in all 4

probability stand for a long period of
time. -

Fourteen high schools and academ-
ies were represented, the entry list
including students from Allegheny,
Avalon, Bridgeville, Central, Clairton,
Edgewood, Fifth Avenue, Freedom,
Kittanning, McKeesport, Peabody, and
Riverside high schools, and East Lib-
erty and Shadyside academies.

. in declamation, letter writing, reading,

extemporaneous speaking, and spell-
ing, gold silver and bronze medals go-

~ ing to the ﬁrst, second, and third con-
testants, respectively, in each event. ‘

The preliminaries were held Saturday

morning and» the ﬁnal contests in the .

evening. The judges of the latter

‘ event were Rev. E. H. Ward, Rev. W.

E. Howard, Rev. J. Lane Miller, Pro-
fessor G. W. Putnam, and Miss Marion
A Holmes. ._

The declamation contest was won
by Diana Igel, of Peabody high, with
Winifred Meehan, of Freedom, second,

' and Howard McElroy, of McKeesport,

third. Martha E. Beasley, of Peabody,
won the contest in letter writing, Wini—
fred Black, of Fifth Avenue, second,

' and Helen E. Percival, of Clairton,

third.

Peabody won the third consecutive
victory .of the evening when Malcolm
Cowley took ﬁrst place in the essay
contest, while Maurice Smith, of Gen-
tral, ﬁnished second and Edward Har-
ris, of East Liberty, third. In the
reading contest, however, Blanch Levy
captured ﬁrst place for Fifth Avenue,
Mazzie Griffiths, of Clairton, taking
second and Charles Stotz, of East Lib-

. erty academy, third.

Jacob Davis won the fourth victory
for Peabody‘ by taking ﬁrst place as
an extemporaneous ‘speaker. Louis

second and Martin Luessenhop, of Cen-
tral, was third. -

The last contest for the best spell-
er, was won by Joseph H. Levy, of

SEVERAL T I E S RESULT.

With managers dragging their sup-
porters to the polls until the eleventh
hour,-—all_wi,th the hope of inﬂuencing
the voters last Wednesday, th_e most
bitter political campaign in the his-
tory of the school, was at white heat,
presenting a spectacle that will long
be remembered by the students of the
University of Pittsburgh. In view of
the new developments arising during
the previous weeks of campaigning,
there was ample jlustiﬁcatign for ex-
pecting sensational moves at any mo-
ment until the polls closed at 3:30
Wednesday afternoon. ‘

on the idea that every single vote was
going to count, and they overlooked
no tactics, however strenuous,.likely
to corral a vote. Many men’ were taken
from beds at their fraternity and
rooming houses and hurried to the
polls. It was a day of politics at Pitt.

After making low records in ‘years
for the total number of votes cast at
former elections, the students of both
the graduate and
schools on account of the recent elec-
tion brought about under 5the new
constitution came back with a new
record for the largest total of votes
cast by the different departments in
any regular election. The constitution-

‘ al convention worked until a late hour

Wednesday in-«counting the votes.

With the appearance this week of
the 1916 Owl, interest in the 1917 pub-
licationis already being aroused, and
the organization meeting of the mem-
bers of next year’s board elected at
last week’s general election, is sched-
uled for today at 12:30 o’clock in 104
State hall. The old system of election
of Owl officers will still prevail, the
seven managers electing from among
their own number the business man-
ager, the editors, similarly the editor-
in-chief, and the electors the president
of the board. The board as now con-
stituted, as far as can be determined,
is as follows: Editors, E. B- George,
Col.; A. P. Lefton, Ec.; Miss Jessie
Rutter, Ed.; R. D. Redding, Eng.; F.
K. Kennedy, Jr., Mines; E. B. Fast,

Dent.; H. H. Sullivan, Med. Managers:_

Miss Louise Moye, Col.; W. C. Arther,

erick, Med. Electors: Ian Forbes, Qol.';
, E. Daugherty, Ec.; Miss Lulwu
Glaser, Ed.; H. G. Grady, Eng.; W. W.

The‘ members of the board are now
busy lining up their adherents and
electioneering for the various plums.

The various legislative bodies pro-
vided for under the new constitution,
are now in process of formation, and
will be completely organized by the
time of the ﬁrst regular meeting of
the General Senate, which is scheduled
for next Wednesday, at 11:30. This
meeting was necessarily postponed
from Monday when it would naturally
be held, on account of the Decoration
day holiday. At that time, it is ;ex-
pected that all the members of the
various school senates of the under-
graduate schools, and possibly the
Dental and Medical members, will be
present. As a constitutional quorum
consists of more than one half of the
present membership of the General
Senate, 22 members must be on hand.
At this meeting will. be elected a presi-
dent, a vice-president, and a secretary-
treasurer, to serve for one year. The
president will be the official and titu-
lar head of the student body, empow-
ered to represent it on all public oc-
casions. All the senators must pre-
sent their credentials at this meeting,
which will then be ﬁled with the secre-
tary. Directly’ following the organ-
ization meeting of the Senate, the
executive committee of» the Senate
‘will be organized,‘consisting of seven
representatives, one from each school.
This committee is to meet once a week

In spite of a steady all day down-
pour of rain and its consequent damp-
ening of clothes as well as the opti-
mlstic spirits, about a hundred loyal
college students, with a sparse sprink-
ling, of faculty representatives, splash-
ed their way to Trees Gymnasirum,
last Thursday afternoon, for the ﬁrst
annual picnic of the department. of
liberal arts, and made the best of an
enforced indoor merrymaking .When
it was ﬁnally ascertained that no let-
up in the downpour could be expected,
negotiations were at once opened with
Director C. S. Miller and the gym-
nasium secured in lieu of a picnic
groqpd. , '

During the early hours of the aft-
ernoon and evening, various games
caused the time to pass rapidly while
the preparations were being made for
supper. After each one discovered
exactly what his capacity for food was
upon this occasion, the _picnickers re-
turned to the ﬂoor and resumed the
games. Owing to the forethought of
one of the girls, a victrola was on hand
to flurnish music. With basketball, a
special class of baseball instruction
for co-eds, and dancing all on the ﬂoor
at the same time, the danger of even
being alive was brought forcibly home
to the dancers. During a pause in
the fun, an attempt was made to
introduce an extemporaneous pro-
gram, but after a solo by G. Irene
Garrison, the other participant bolted.
Shortly after nine o’clock, the janitor
with a worthy regard for the words
of his instructions, turned off the
lights as a warning that it was time
to go home. v

“Extra, all about the greatest Owl

familiar Words being rehearsed by the
members of the 1916 Owl staff to. be
shouted to the students on Friday
morning when the’ wise bird will make

work, the 1915 Owl board has com-
pleted the compilation of one of the/'
best volumes in the history of the
school., .
The 1916 Owl has the following ded-
ioation apparently before the ful page
pictures of two Pitt notables. “As a '0
slight token of appreciation to ‘the
donors of the beautiful building in
which the Mellon Institute of Indus-
trial Research is housed, and to the
givers of many other generous gifts,

ed with its staff and fellows. Then
come the picures of the Administra-
tive ofﬁces, followed by pictures of" the’
former chancellors and ﬁrst buildings
of the University. ’
The book is divided into four parts.
Book one contains dedication and his-
tory; book two contains Roster and
character sketches; book three ,a
resume of athletics; book fouracon-
tains miscellany and advertisements.
It is the second book which the
anxious juniors ' are awaiting with
curiosity, for it is in this book that
their dooms have been penned and
sealed by their servants, the editors.
The activities, clubs and fraternities
of the schools are played up in book
four, and is one of the heaviest illus-
trated that has ever been published by
Pitt students. Pitt men of athletic
fame have also‘ been recorded with its
many voluminous illustrations in the
third archive of the junior class. . Pic-
tures of the varsity athletic teams", to-

various and excitable moments that
have been witnessed by so many Pitt
loyalites will be brought back to mem-
ory. The fourth book is given over
to the» various clubs and activities,
also pictures that the freshmen in the‘
various departments of the University
will keep as memoirs of their Alma
Mater. On the last page is a cartoon
dedicated to the former Owls where-
in there are pictured tombstones bear-

an action at a recent meeting decided
that no classes should be held on that

and one with a consideable measure of
justiﬁcation was that of impotence.

ogressive,” said they, “the faculty
or the board of deans or somebody

their divine power of veto and effectu-
’Ki1y.squashes the movement.” The
validity of this complaint is dependent

of progressive deeds and just how

action that ‘_ the student governing
‘body can take, looking toward im-
provement in innumerable phases of
tudent ‘ affairs, without fear of the
W mpening effects of ‘authoritative re-
trai-nt is self-evident. That there is
‘her range of action whichis more

 proval, is equally apparent.

It will be the duty of the new body

and deﬁnite understanding with

The advantages of “sings? are too

U manager‘ of student" activities.

, Pittsburgh’ Pa.,
Editor PITT WEEKLY,
Dear Sir: ‘A v -
’ .I have been making a rather thor-
ough study, of student activities in the
University and ﬁnd that the business
done by the various organizations has
reached amazing proportions. The
Board of Trustees realized this fact
a couple of years ago, and created an
advisory board to student "activities,
this_board to-have absolute power in
the matter‘ of the ﬁnancial administra-
tion. The work accomplished by this
board needs no comment. Its mem-
bers have exercised a jurisdiction over
the «accounts of the clubs which has
resulted in bringing them out of debt,
placing them in a sound ﬁnancial
basis. _ _ . r

I think the time has come when the
office of the paid graduate manager
similar to the office of the graduate
manager of athletics should be creat-
ed by the Board of Trustees. ~ The
different activities would have stud-
ent mahagers as at present who would
be ‘supervised by this‘ graduate man-
ager of student activities. ' ‘

The ‘result would be a better rela-
tionship -between the different organi-

created, petty differences which do
more harm than good would be settled

than at present when each manager
can see only his side of the case. The
present system ~of competition would
be carried out properly under gradu-
ate management. The chronic ..kick-
ers among the students would not be
subjecting student managers to criti-
cism as they do at the present time.
By having a graduate manager the

keep all productions up to the stand-
ard and make all necessary .. explan-
ations. B A

This plan is used in Eastern Schools.
.Wisconsin has also worked it out, and
the lg-raduatemanagement of the or-
ganizations there is in charge of 
Alvin . Kessler, ﬁyrmerly connected
with the School of Economics of this
University. I can see no reason why
it will not work out "here in just the
same way that, graduate manager of
athletics has worked out.

.In making this suggestion I have
no axe to grind and am not as can-
didate for the position of graduate
I can
see after four years experience with

B activities in this University that such

an office must be created, and think

‘that the time is here when student

 ISHING 'EN'I‘HUSh"ASM.* 0 R"
It is very sad, indeed for one to
grow old only. to discover that his
cl.assr_nate who had given exceptional
promise of celebrity in his youth was
destined to die‘ in obscurity. -Such a
_pitful spectacle, however, is not a rar-
ity. But in spite of its morefor less
usual ocurrence, I ﬁnd that the cause
is generally unknown. ‘n
i As a ball driven by a bat will grad-
ually decrease in velocity until A it
comes ﬁnally to a stop, so too does
ones enthusiasm wane.— So insidious
is the approach of apathy that the vic-
tim himself‘ never becomes wholly
‘aware of ‘ his ailment. His pristine
zeal diminishes gradually and he hon-
estly believes that he «still ﬁnds the

is that he now takes only a half heart-
ed and perfvunctoryfinterest in his em-
ployment, and deludes himself with
the notion’ that because his task" is
now more odious than it once was that
he is therefore“ working that much
harder at _it, which fact presumably
explains his excessive weariness.
Little does he; realize that man is
naturally ‘a lazy animal. When he
becomes tired and ceases his labor, it
requires great effortfor him to rouse
himself from_ a state of very comfort-
able idleness. There must be some in-
ducement offered ‘him, some remun-
eration, some renown, some beneﬁt,

effort to overcome the initial inertia.
If he is enthusiastic about his voca-
tion, he most likely will return to his
work though the prospect" of great
gains 1S not bright; but enthusiasm is
ordinary a n- evanscent quality.
Hence weariness and negligence are
perpetually and silently . blighting
one s_ ardor, and lessening the quality
of his work, until the former leader
ﬁnds his talents. equalled, and some-
times surpassed, by those of the com-
mon rank and ﬁle of humanity. ..
_ The‘ lot of the industrious" man is
equally deplorable if he fails to keep
his ﬁre of enthusiasm replenished.
Let him engage. in some enterprise
with a false. conception of its facility,
or a too high opinion of his own
power and itrrequires all the zeal he
can muster _to ‘avert utter failure; and
unless he is. an exceedingly. strong-
willed man he will become somewhat
disheartened. Moreover, it is not only
‘common _to ﬁnd the difficulty of an en-
terprise greater, but the’ proﬁt less,
than our extreme «hope "had pictured it.
It is no wonder ‘then that -when the
prospect of . reward has vanished, our
zeal should cease.

There are other industrious persons,
however,who, in a sense, are far more
fortunate”than their plodding breth-
ren..- Success crowns their ﬁrst en-
deavors.
easy and short. But eminence secured
too ‘easily IS apt not to be duly apprec-
iated and venerated. Their uncom-
mon power and talents ﬁll them with
presumption; they ‘cease throwing
their utmost ability into their tasks;
with the result that the quality of
their” output declines. Their former
skill deteriorates with negligence and

their rivals, whom they once clearly
and unmistakably excelled are now
their superiors. "

‘ Consequently it is obvious that
without enthusiasm our endeavors are
futile. The man who has lost his zest
for life and work, who is not zealous
in all that he does, who is not enthus-
iastically alive toﬂeverything in the
‘world about him, has virtually aban-
doned, himself to chance and is only
awaiting the moment when he.will be
swallowed up in the gulf of mortality.

The ﬁrst step toward a general re-

been taken in the election of the mem-

ﬁrst general Spring election day, and
the organization of thesbody at to-

tion was delayed until October or No-
vember, on account of the fact. that
the Junior class in the School of Phar-
macy does not enter-until September.
But the policy of organizing the bosrd
immediately after it election ‘in May
is altogether"justiﬁa le, seven schools
having already elected, and the vote
of the Pharmacy representatives be-
ing ‘unable to change the ﬁnal result
in any event, beyond making_ it a tie.

steps. As referred to elsewhere, one

Editor PITT WEEKLY,
Dear Sir: '

The preliminary arrangements . for
the Pitt summer camp to be he_ld_1n
September in the Lake Placid region
of the Adirondacks are complete. The
Adirondack Camp and Trail club have
offered «us the use of one of their open
camps on Lake Heart, 10 miles from

Lake Placid, right in the heart of the

wildest region. and within sight of the
highest peaks—Mt. Marcy. (Tahawus),
McIntyre,.Indian Pass, etc. They-have
promised to do more for us in case we
need their suggestions and help. We
shall nevertheless make use of tents,
as the open camp, referred to, does
not accommodate more than eight
persons. K _

‘The expenses for the whole period
of three weeks are extremely low, so
that no one can possibly be handicap-
ped on ﬁnancial grounds. The.move-
-ment is a new one, at least in this
form, and wijl need the support of. the
student body. - It seems that a_ pro-
ject, of which the purpose is to intro-
duce the Pitt body of men to the
charms and beauties of the mountains-
and afford them an opportunity to
devise physical beneﬁt therefrom,
such as could be gotten nowhere else.
It deserves some measure of support
and encouragement. V

It now remains to complete the or-
ganization of the clsub and chose the
registration list, as well as make def-.
inite‘ arrangements for payment of
dues. These matters Will be_ taken ‘up
and settled in tonight’s-meeting,’ which

It is especially desirable that all the

held underthe auspices of the Crafton

from both schools and colleges as well
as from many of the independent
clubs of this district. ‘

The association offers a cup, which
is to be held permanently by the col-
lege winning it three years. Washing-

entered in each of the past two years
and has won the ﬁrst two legs for the
posession of the ‘cup. They are anxious :

The W. k. ill wind which brought
us rain by the barrel last week did at
least one good turn in prolonging the
rest of one James‘ Burwell, victim of
a ptulled tendon. J. Monroe ought to
be in ﬁne shape “to take the measure
of a few State men about June 5th.

This week will be one of the sea-

followers are due for three appear-

That rain last Saturday may kid
a few track men out of their letters,
unless some of them can turn loose
some world-beating performances
against State. Two‘ or three of the
cinder—path men are just under the re-
quired total of ten, and need a place
or two to ‘pull down the bacon.

If you haven’t anything but a few
lectures or lab periods ahead of you
this afternoon, do a hike, out to Aspin-

the skids under the natives of that

be minus a victory tonight. ‘ ’

the oldtimers who has not gone back
to any appreciable extent. Pitt’s

FLUNKING ATHLETE" V ..
* QNOW RATHERPRARE.

One of the high crieslﬂagainst ath-,
letics in schools and ”un‘i.versities by‘
outside critics is to the effect‘ that the-
men who are stars in an athleticwaiy
are seldom, if ever, even ordinarily
good ‘students. Thevcontrary is very
often true, however, there are many
cases where the men who make names.
for themselves in the athletic world
also stand near the head or at the
-head of their respective classes.

There is now a movement on foot
in the University to put into effect a
new system whereby these men’ shall
have the proper recognition for their“
dual endeavors. The plan’ which has
been evolved is somewhat similarvto
the one now in operation in the Middle
Western Athletic Association. Under
this plan, one man who stood highest
both in athletics and in a scholastic.
way would be selected every, year, and
to him would be presented - a medal
as a mark of honor for his accomplish-.
ments. As amatter of course, the

graduating class. For example, the
man who would have been, nominated
to this honor last year must’ have been
“Hube” Wagner, who was known to
the world as. Captain and star player

The object A of this scheme is to
demonstrate to the public the fact that
the men who make Pitt famous on

also known in the inner circles as men
ofl ability and high standing scolastic-
a y. I  b.

An incessant‘ downpour which began

on Friday and continued until a late
hour last Saturday afternoon‘ trans-
formed Schenley Oval into agswamp
and compelled the‘ cancellation" of the
Intercollegiate and Interscholastic
Field and Track meet, which was to
have been held under the University’s
auspices. ,
.;'Up ,_to the very last minute Pitt’s
athletic authorities held out hopes for
the running of the meet according to.
schedule, but at eleven’ o’clock the rain
was still falling, and the track was in
absolutely unﬁt condition for competi-
tion. Manager Opsion was therefore-
forced to get word to the various team
managers, advising them that the
meet was off the program. -

Without doubt, the failure to ull
off the _meet was the biggest athetic
disappointment Pitt has had in a long
time.‘ .Nei7er in the history of this
classic have the prospects been so
bright for asuccessful meet, both in

,.the college and in the prepschool divi-

sion. Seven teams were entered in the
senior -section, while over thirty ag-
gregations were represented inI...th’e

The Miners lay clai-m _to the-title
of the University by virtue of the fact
that they decisively defeated the rep-
resentatives of the Medical school by
the overwhelming score of» 23-3. The
Medics had previously harpooned sev-
eral of the -i other school aggregations,
so that the meeting between the two
delegations constituted what is styled
a titular contest.-~

Still eager for the cotursinggore of
more foemen, the Prussian band stood

ered the strong team of the Aspin-
wall high school.

allx-before them and the win over such
a formidable aggregation speaks well
for the form of ‘the Miners’ squad.

‘Doctor Phillips was born in Phila-
delphia on April. 2,.1850, and received
his early training at the Academy of
the Protestant Episcopal church of
that city. He entered the University
of Pennsylvania in’1866 taking a clas-
sical course. At that time no labor-
atory instruction was given in univer-
sities so the students depended entire--

formed by their profssors. Special
attention was- given to" the classics,
and so engineering -and science, shud-
ents, instead of taking laboratory and
shop work, devoted this time to the
study of Greek and Latin- Doctor
John Frazer was incharge of chem-
istry at Pennsylvania.» .

In 1871 Doctor Phillips became in-
structor_ in chemistry in Delaware col-
lege, Newark, Deleware, and a year
later went Germany to enter the lab-
oratory of Regimus Fresenius at Wies-
baden. The Professor ﬁrst made a
brief journey through England and
France. His arrival at Biebrich, a
suburb of Wiesbaden and on the- oppo-
site bank of the Rhine, recalls an ex-
perience in the Doctor’s life: This
was shortlyafter the Franco-Prussian
war when the building of bridges was
omitted for military reasons. Doc-
tor Phi-llips by ichancemet two other
prospective students, and in a small
row boat the three of them braved
snow and wind. This journey ended
almost as did that of the. three other
wise men who, according. to history,
once" went to sea in a bowl-. On the
day after the shipwreck, Doctor Phil-
lips found himself pleasantly located
and at work. in the laboratory. * Fres-
-enius, famed for his knowledge of in-
organic and analytical chemistry, had
few equals as a lecturer and-his class-
es were attended by students of many
nationalities. After a year’s work
as a student, Doctor Phillips was ap-
pointed .private assistant ‘to Doctor
Freseni-us, a position which he held
for one year. -Then he went to the
Polytechnical School in Munich where
he attended the lectures of Erlen-
meyer in organic chemistry and Joly
in physics. From Munich Doctor Phil-
lips went to Aachen (Aix la Chapelle)
where he attended the lectures of Lan-
dolt, Classen, Wullner and La Spey-»
eres. -
Returning to Philadelphia in 1875,
he atonce received an appointment to
take charge of chemistry at the West-
ern University. At that time chem-
istr.y did not constitute a separate de-
partment but included geology, miner-
alogy and zoology, and previous to
that time additional sciences had been
included with it, and‘ Doctor Phillips
felt quite relieved when it became pos-
sible to narrow his work to only three.
At this time chemistry was a senior:
study and was gradually carried for-
ward to the junior and.‘even sopho-
more classes, lectures and laboratory
receiving a half year each. Labora-
tory work.in other sciences had not‘
yet been thought of. -

In August 1878 a number of apothe-.
caries held a meetingin the Univer-
sity Chapel and it. was decided to
establish a School of Pharmacy in
October, of the same year. The’ ﬁrst
lectures on chemistry were given by
Doctor Phillips.» As soon as the school

MAY QUEEN ELECTION
sluls up TROUBLE

 With the necessity of choosing a
May Queen following so closely upon
their adventures into school govern-
ment, the coeds of the University are
becoming more deeply involved /than
ever, in, the toils and meshes of in-
trigue and dirty politics. As'it seems
impossible to agree upon any selec-
tions as candidates the election is be-
ing held up; consequently the days. of
May-draw to a close and it seems un-
avoidable that the queen V, of the May
should become .a June bride or what-
ever they do become wheh they are
late. With the three original candi-
dates increasedto six, and then with
a new trio in the ﬁeld, the latest an-_
nouncements obtainable stated. that
candidates were Ruth Harvey, Helen
Fisher and Olive Neudorfer, and that
the election would be——but, that’s
another question. v i 

And yet the eternal question\ con-
tinues to disrupt the lessons of the
fairer sex: - Who should -be queen. of
the May (1916)? .

‘ Note:-——The management of THE
PITT WEEKLY will take no respon-
sibility, as to whom the candidates
may be by tomorrow, for the said list
seems‘ to be an illustration‘ of perpetu-
al change. ' '

FRANCIS CLIFFORD ”DAD” PHILLIPS, PH. D.

was well organized and received the
support of the apothecaries of the
region’ Doctor, Phillips recommended
that a separate instructor in chemis-
try be appointed. The growth of this
schoo and its reputation under the
able management of Doctor J. A.
Koch and his vasociates is such that it
requires no further comment-here. At
this time, Dr. Phillips received his M.
A. degree at Pennsylvania.

"In 1882 the University moved _ to
Allegheny, the. previous work having
been done on the old site at Ross and
Diamond streets. The laboratory was
located on the ground ﬂoor of the Re-
formed Presbyterian Seminary build-
ing, 204 North avenue ‘and courses

‘were offered in analytical and organic

chemistry and in mineralogy. At this
time pioneer work was begun by Doc-
tor Phillips on the chemistry of nat-
ural gas and it was . partly due to
work in this ﬁeld that he received the
degree of Ph. D. from the University
of Pennsylvania, 1894.: -

Towards the close of 1889 the Uni-
versity moved to Observatory Hill and
the Department was given a separate
building with‘ more modern equip-
ment and facilities. In the twenty
years spent in these quarters real pro-
gress was made in the addition of
new courses and the strengthening of
old" ones, and it was then that the
foundation was laid for the present
department which came after the Uni-
versity moved to its new site.‘

The work of Doctor Phillips as. a
teacher can‘ best be judged by the pro-
duct, among his pupils are J. M. Camp
chairman of the Chemists committee
of the U. S. Corpoation; C.-M. John-
son, Chief Chemist,Crucible Steel Co.;
Doctor Walther Riddle of the Sterling
Varnish Co.; E. E. Johnson of the
Semet-Solvay Co.; E.. R. Walters of.
the Lincoln Foundry Co. and too -many
others to be mentioned in the limited
space afforded here. Not only. did
Doctor. Phillip undertake the in;
structional work with very little as-
sistance, but ‘as can be seen from the
following list many important re--
searches were conducted and results:
published in various scientiﬁc journ-
als. Among the most important of

these were the ones dealing with the

various phases in the origin and "pro-

"duction of natural gas and petroleum,

and the action‘ of various chlorides
and oxides, as well as investigations
upon the water of the Allegheny river.
The second edition of a textbook of
“Chemical German” is now in the
hands of the printers. ‘

Doctor Phillips .has researches under
way at present which, with the facil-
ities at hand should prove even more.
important than any published hereto-
fore. The doctor bears the friendship
and goodwill of everyone associated
withhim, and though he is planning
to retire -from active ‘service, his
friends feel certain that his happiest
days are yet to come. ,

Doctor Phillips is ,a member of the
American Philosophical Society, the
American ‘Chemists’ Society, the
American Institute of Mining Engi-
neers, and of Phi Kappa Sigma. He
is also a member of the University.
and the German clubs of Pittsburgh.

"_‘The greatest of them all,” were
the only words that could be gotten
from either Editor-in-Chief «Ryan,
Business Manager Moran, or Presi-
dent‘ of the Board Tanney. For
further information, they would say,
“apply to the famous Owl. of 1916, and
read ‘We Hate Ourselves’/’ I

This is what‘ they say: .

“In presenting the ninth issue of
the Owl, the class of 1916 places‘ it-
self on record as being fully awake
to the progress of the time. Hurried
resumes of former year.-books at this
institution convince the staff that this
edition is, in‘ a fair way, representa-
tive of the upward strides being made
by a rapidly expanding and promising
University. -

“To publish the 1916 Owl has i-
deed been a great privilege and pleas-
ure for the staff, and if the class
accepts it as fulﬁlling its intended mis-
sion in due manner, however meager
we will feel that our efforts have not
been in vain.”

Justlthe minute it touches

the paper, a Moore starts writing.

No fussing with it to get it going. '

. For when a Moore is'closed, the pen goes ‘
down into the ink. And it comes up moist,
ungummed, ready to write at theﬁrst stroke.

Another thing you’ll like in 9. Moore is_its sa_fety. Drop it
in your pocket ’any way that's_convement—zt_won’t leak.
For when the cap screws down, it shuts up the Ink chamber

of its exclusive features. Many styles from $2.50 up.

IN TERSCHOLASTIC CONTEST.

(Continued from Page 1).

0nd and one third, Freedom one sec-
ond, and East Libery Academy and
McKees_port two thirds apiece. ‘

One important feature of the con-
test was the elimination of all coach-
ing. Before ‘both the preliminaries
and the ﬁnals, the students were per-.
mitted to think over their productions
and  outline a mode of procedure,
but no help could be given the student
while Tie was on the platform. ~ ’

While. the contest was under the
nominal charge of Professor C. B.-
Robertson of the extension depart-
ment, yet the success_ which attended
its ﬁrst appearance was due largely
to the careful preparations made by
Professor F. H. Lane, of the,depart-
merit of public speaking. .Every de-
tail of, the work was cared for in his
well_worked out plans and theresult
of his efforts wasevident throughout
the whole- contest. C ' _

In many respects, the contest was
One of the ‘most notable in Pitt his-
tory, and the University expects to
make it an annual affair, anticipatiiig
an even‘ greater amount of interest on
the part of the high schools during
the coming years. _ This year=’s ,con-
test was received with a_ greatodegree
of enthusiasm and the results indi-
cated a high grade of instruction on

- the part of the secondary schools.

Il Circolo Italiano‘ -

I1 Circolo Italiano of the University
on Friday, May 21, held its spring en-
tertainment which as usual proved a
huge success. The entertainment con-
sisted of both musical and literary
numbers. About two-hundred people
were present. Among the speakers
were two Alumni, Attorney T. Bell,
Law ’07, and Dr. F. Teres, Dental ’13.
‘Both spoke encouragingly of the Uni-
versity and of the increased number
ofltalian students in the University.

The music also was very good,
several solos being rendered by sing-
ers of this locality. After the musi-
cal and literary numbers, refresh-
ments were passed and then dancing
was in order until .12 o’clock. 1

Plans are under way for bigger do-
ings next year, and with the rapid
strides that the club has made in the
last few years, next year should. be
the best ever. '

A meeting will be held in the near
future at which the oﬂicers will be
elected for next year. Members
please watch bulletin ‘boards for an-
nouncements as to the coming meet-
ing. ’

last Wednesday was the Countess
Marie de Heptinne, of Ghent, Belgium,

American people in the Belgian. lace__

workers »in order to revive this’ in-
dustry in that country. Conditions
there are very- depressing, as nearly
everything has been taken from the

ing required for each one.
