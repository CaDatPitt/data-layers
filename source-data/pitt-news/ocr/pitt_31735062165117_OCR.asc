By’ AL DONALSO_N _

Four opposition councilmen postponed the adoption of
a proposed Men’s Council constitutional. amendment last
Wednesday afternoon. Only 13 representatives were present
for the MC meeting last week, and 13 “favorable” votes

"are needed to amend Council’s constitution. , -
For the second straight week, a proposal to change the
' election procedure of the at-large representatives of MC was
tabled for further consideration after being defeated in- two

rounds of balloting. The bill

Tom Tarolli, Eng. ’57, and Dické

Murphy, Eng.*.56, were the four
who voted ‘against the measure.

‘Proportionately’ Elected
The billwould permit 13 at-
large representatives to be nomi-
nated from any school on the
campus. Present regulations re-
quires ‘that candidates be f‘pro-
portionately” elected _from the
College, Business Administration,
and Engineering and Mines
schools. '
‘ fActing as spokesman for the
recalcitrants, Dick Murphy stat-
ed he was against the proposal
because it doesn’t insure proper
representation, and because it
, provides “a. possibility that one

school can control Council.”

sir Council To 
I NIC’s Suggestions

 

Y

By AL DONALSON
Interfraternity Council will investigate eight recommen-
dations received from the National Interfraternity Council.
,Secretary Larry Miller, who attended the conference
along with President John King and Vice—Pr.esident Don
Gartner, read the eight resolutions during the IF meeting

last Thursday evening at the Phi Epsilon Pi house.
' conference was held in St. Louis recently.

The

The proposals by Miller were: 9

1. Institute a pledge IF Coun-
cil.
Institute a Student IF Ju-
dicial Committee.
.3. Institute IF dinner meetings.
Encourage the reactivation of
the Pitt alumni Fraternity
Council. . '

.5. Substitute the ‘Help Week

,program for the Hell, Week.

6. Institute a Public Relations
committee.

7. Innovate two more ,IF tro-
phies.

8. Have a Junior Delegate at-
tend all future NIC confer-
ences.

Miller pointed out that some of

these recommendations have al-

ready been practicedby IF, such
as the Help Week program.

.The institution of air Judicial

Committee would replace the

present Men’s Fraternity Com-

mittee, whichis composed of ten
faculty members along with frat-
ernity presidents._The committee

. rules on all disciplinary matters
concerning fraternities. In the
present setup, ‘the fraternity
presidents have no vote. Miller
feels that “students passing
judgement on students” would
have more signiﬁcance than fa-
culty judgement.

While ‘the, NIC has no legisla- -

tive power, Miller stateo. that the
conference proved to be “a very
valuable experience because of
the exchange of ideas.” The pur-
pose of NIC is to discuss ques-
tions of “mutual interest” con-
cerning fraternities and to “bet-
ter —the college fraternity sys-
tem.” ~
“While wegwere at":-he confer-
ence, we discovered that our IF
is as far advanced as any in the
“country. We are far superior to
many,” Miller added.

has been given to Larry Cervi,
Col. ’58, in the 1956 Library Edi-

Cervi was selected by officials
of the National Baton Twirling
Association, Janesville, Wisc., in
conjunction with the editors of
the nationally circulated Drum
Major magazine as one of the
800 outstanding young men and
' women in the twirling field". This
achievement is even greater when
ﬁgures show more than 130,000
twirlers are active in the United
States today.

The 300—page book contains

tories of America’s greatest twirl-
ing stars, the story of the evolu-

This ‘year’s editorial will be

The honor of the selection can

The Omnibus staff has ﬁnally produced a magazine
which reveals the» subtle balance of literary value and hu-
morous incident which was the goal of its revivalists last
spring. .The holiday issue which appeared on the news
stands last Wednesday afternoon covers a wide range of
writing from short story to sports analysis’.

Sex, liquor, and racy songs are three subjects
that college students will willingly pursue in their

social-animal desire to be well-rounded.

For the average" student, the boy-meet—girl sit-
uation provides ample oppor,tunity for mental
planning; surrounding. ale houses provide setting
for discussion, much in the manner of Seventeenth
Century literary salons; loud and ‘
lewd singing develops vocal qual-
ities to enhance discussion of im-
portant government activity.

Yes, it is the “easy—way” to -
learn. Imbition is a unique means
to preserve inner organs for fut-
ure experimentation. Ever since
that well-received author wrote
the words “wine, women, and
song,”students have taken up the
cry of the elder, breaking out of ivory towers to en-
joy the cold, cruel world.

Dry Classes , ‘ ,

As a result, there is a general tendency through-
out this university to slough off dry classroom study;
so, the true challenge for not few of our students
is how long they can keep their books closed in
order to pull through courses. They usually are
keen enough to abide by Universityi~rulings——care-
fully cutting only three periods of each subject. ,

Paradoxically, they often find opportunities to
express themselves in class-—usually at the beginn-

ing of the semester. Professors are already acquaint-
ed with them. Novice lecturers are early warned.

These Epicureans will violently oppose any sug-

gestions for collateral reading. This semester, for
example, a history professor required that students
read two volumes of any 24 listed on a selective
form. The wail of protests students raised against
the unfortunate man would have rivaled the cries
of the most violent exile at the Wailing Wall.

The Milder Student

Then, of course, there are the milder students
whose keen interest in University problems engages
them so, that they find little leisure to sniff the
smoke-filled, alcohol—infested atmosphere of local
pubs. ’ ' A.

Nights spent on telephones, days used in pre-
paring signs or participating at conferences, pro-
vide little time for meeting any erudite burden the
schools may offer. ' .

Here too, are students whose ingenuity more than
brow-beaten intelligence quotients may push them
through the semester. After graduation, they’ll haul
in more greenbacks than any professor teaching at

the University. I can’t»help but sympathize with-

their inevitable statement, “Those teachers ain’t so
smart._” - " ‘ ' A
It's a Great Thing _ _ _
Yes, it’s agreat thing, this thing called “college
life.” There is enough academic freedom for one_

to decide whether he’ll devote'his time to ‘study of A

Justice Black or Black Label.

But students should, not receive all credit for I

such liberal policy. 'The many faculty members,
progressive enough to realize that extra academic
requirements would infringe on underclass privileg-
es, should also be acknowledged. Q ' ’

HOW .TO BE A ‘Bwoc

A few weeks ago in this space I passed on some hints to college
men who wished to become BMOCS. I would be remiss not to do
the same for college women who wish to become BWOCS. .

The ﬁrst and most basic step on the road to being,a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is bound
to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says, “HEY!
LOOKIT— ME!” Don’t you make such a horrid gaffe. On your
placard put: “ZUT! REGARDEZ-MOI 1"’ This, as you can ‘see,

“lends-a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.
_ Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry _
the placard. It will suﬂice if, from time to time, you make dis-
tinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes

minds‘ of onlookers.

We come now to cloth-es, a vital accessory to the BWOC‘?-ind_eed,‘i';. '

you cry, “Whip-poor~will!” you cannot but stay fresh in the

to any girl who wishes to remain out of -jail. But tothe BWOC -_-
, clothes are more than just a- decent cover; they are, itis not too

, much to say, a way of life.

This year the “little boy look’’ is -all the rage on campus. Every

— coed, in a mad eﬁort to look like a little boy, is wearing short ..
pants,«knee sox, and boy-shirts. But the BWOC is’ doing more.
She has gone the whole hog in achieving little boyhood-.wShe 6
has frogs in her pockets, scabsion her knees, down on her upper
lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot..  —

All this, of course, --is only byday. When evening falls and her
-. date comes calling, the BW-OC is the very pictureof chic fem-
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiﬁed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail. Her.
daytime scuffs have been replaced by fashionable high heeled
pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to the movies.

After the movies at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes _

her severest test. The true BWOC willnever, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and can only cause one’s date
to blench. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrées
‘ and then have nothing more till dessert. This is class and is the

hallmark of the true BWOC.

    

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigaretteﬁgvendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, “Philip
Morris, of corris!” For any girl knows that a Pl-1ili.p,..,Morris
in one’s hand stamps one instantly as a person of taste and
discernment, asthe possessor of an educated palate, as ea con-
noisseur of the ﬁner, gentler, higher pleasures. This-—P-hilip
Morris, this badge of saxuoir faire, now comes to you in a smart
new pack of red, white and gold, in king-size or’ regular, at

popular prices, wherever cigarettes are sold.

ccasionally, mighty occasionally at that, we get a com-

She writes: ‘

Dear Mr. Aromatorio, ‘ ,

I have a few questions I would like to ask you con-
cerning sports and the sports pages of the Pitt News.
Normally, you see, I don’t care for sports except to watch the
football players. My girl friend, though, is a member of the
hockey team and she is al-ways reading the sports pages of
Pitt News and she always insists that I read the stories about
the hockey team. They are playing voleyball now. Anyway,
because my girl friend has been having me read about sports,
I have been a reader of the Pitt News sports pages. I .went to all
the football games this year (except the away ones), but I
‘wasn’t going to the basketball games_ because Pitt does not ’

‘ usually have a very good basketball team. Besides it always
_ embarrassesvme to watch basketball because the players wear
those small shorts that are almost as small as ,bikini bathing
suits. Well, anyway,'I was reading last week’s Pitt News be-
 cause there was a story about the TPA.’s winningethe. voIey-

- ball teams on that page. I read ‘your long column and the
story that saidthe‘ Michigan team had a star‘ footballiplayer

the game with her I said “O.K.” We went up and got there just
/when,the game was all ready to start. Those little shorts the
‘players were wearing still embarrass me. ' ‘ p , '

But now come my questions. The ﬁrst question is why
does a ﬁeld goal count for 3 points in football and only 2 points
in a basketball game? Another question I want to ask before
I forget is why doesn’t anyone try to-stop a player who is
shooting a foul? They just stand there and ‘watch him. One
more question concerning your paper before I quit (I have a V
psych class in 5 minutes). Why do youecall the basketball players

about giving ‘me a couple more days,‘ though, to recqver from ‘/your

Rambling the southern grid-

Under Dodd, Georgia Tech

all. The most signiﬁcant feature
of these victories is the fact,the
Yellow Jackets "re the only team
ever to win four major bowl con-
tests in succession.

The Engineers won. the 1952
Orange Bowl,‘ the,1953 and 1954
Sugar Bowl affairs, the 1955 Cot-
ton Bowl, and are now going

Nationality Rooms
Stimulate Foreign

Holiday Customs

By NANCY C. JONES

Every year Mrs. Avery
Bernhard, associate professor
of journalism, asks her story-
‘hungry r e p o r tin g class,
.“Where do the Christmas
trees in the Commons Room
come from? Never has that
question been answered, until now.

Here are the facts. Santa Claus
brought them. Santa Claus came

' to Pitt last Saturday. Parking his

 

sleigh on the 43rd ﬂoor (parking
problem Santa slid down the
chimney to the Commons Room
and pulled from his sack ten tall
trees plus an 18-foot pine.

Santa’s helpers, members of Quo
Vadis, society of Nationality Room
Hostesses, decorated’ the trees and
then ‘hurried on to put up the
traditional trimmings in the Na-
tionality Rooms.

Decorating the Christmas tree
is acustom started in Germany
long ago. There are many tales

' about how it began. One is’ that
' a German was walking in a for-
, est on Christmas night when he
noticed reﬂections of Stars
sparkling onvsnow-covered ever-
greens. He took a tree heme and
tried to imitate, with many tiny
candles, what he had seen.
Thus, a _large white candle,
brought from Germany, is found
among the decorations in Pittls
German Room. '
Nativity Scene
A nativity scene with eight-inch
ﬁgures and a small wooden stable
ﬁlls the entire window alcove of
the Italian Room. Hovering above
the thatched roof, is an angel
carrying the sign “Gloria in ex-
celsis Deo!” .
In Italy there is no Santa
Claus, instead, the Italian chil-
 dren are- told about a beneﬁcent
old witch, Befana, who leaves
presents for them on Christmas
Eve. This and other stories of
far-away Christmases are told
to the Quo Vadis hostesses by
members of each Nationality
. Room’s committee'as they dec-
orate the rooms together. _
Lithuanian committee members

delight in telling about’.Christmas :

in their. country while they dec-
orate the little window tree with
dried fruit, or arrange the straw
under the" tablecloth as a reminder
-of the night at Bethlehem. In

.try they have shortened it. To

The Greek people say the golden

chestnut and pork ﬁlling, an
plenty of ﬁne wine. *

The Chinese call the Christ-
as tree the Tree of Light. How-
ever, in China there is no
Christmas celebration and, thus,
the Chinese room is not dec-

A 15-foot tree in the English
room is simply decorated with
lights and icicles. Mistletoe, which
grows abundantly in England, is
hung_over the door of the English
room.

The ﬁreplace is brimming with
greens and logs to represent the
famous Yule Log. In old English
Christmas festivities a Yule log
was placed in the ﬁreplace with
great ceremony on Christmas «Eve.
There was much singing, drinking,
and story telling. The Yule log was
to burn all night. If it went out, it
was a sign of bad luck for the
coming year.
