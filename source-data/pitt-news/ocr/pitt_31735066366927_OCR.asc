  $19.5 Million Debt

 

A32 foot high spurt of oil on
Alumni Hall lawn marked the
end of the University's $19.5 mil-
lion debt, Treasurer David Goneff
announced today. The well was
discovered by the Board of Trus-
tees after a heavy rainstorm. As
hard up as we are we were look-
ing for a pot of gold, one bored

The oil turned out to be a

break in the city’s_ main fuel sup-
ply_ line. Repairs will cost at
least $1.5 million changing the

. debt to $21 million.

“We were sure we had found
an easy way out,” said Goneff,
“but now dang it, even the mayor
is mad at us. We will ‘have to
charge commuting students an
extra $1,000 per term to pay the

 increase.‘

/‘

We are also increasing the ac-
tivities fee to $52.60 per student,
$51 of which we will put aside
for another rainy day.

posit on Soldiers and Sailors, Pro-

can't meet the payments we may

of time. . ’ .

At the same time there was a
picket line outside the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, protesting
the discrimination practiced dur-
ing the recent Duquesne Club
ﬁre. We didn’t receive equal pub-
licity in The Pitt News, a mem-
ber articulated.

',As the oil_ from the broken
line began oozing onto Fifth Ave-
nue, there was a veritable mad-
house of skids. Peace rnongers
began using the goodly supply
for immolation demonstrations
and several fraternity men were
scrapping the black goop off the
streets for" sale to tourists.

Psychologist

“Behavioral science has made

study of sex,” said Dr. Libby
Doe, head of the Center for Psy-
cho-Sex Research, at‘ Wednes-
day’s Midday Series.

Dr. Doe, author of 28 books on’

marriage adj_ustment, reported
the results of intensive studies on
the application of behaviorist
learning theory to sexual beha-
vior to the overﬂow crowd.

.“For instance,” Dr. Doe ex-
plained, “using the tested prin-

ciples of reinforcement and re-,

ward we have perfected antin-

Dr. Edward Crooke, part-time
political science professor, part-
time mayor of Oakland, and full-
time party-man for the democrat-
ic, machine was chosen unani-
mously as Chancellor of the Uni-

versity by the Board of Trustees‘

today.

“Dr. Crooke represents the ideal
for our University,” said bored
chairman Gwilym O. Priceless.
“Because of his involvement in
the machine politics of Pennsyl-
vania he possesses the political
cument to rectify our ﬁscal sit-
uation. After all he’s not named
Crooke for nothing. He will also
be able to cement ﬁrm relations
with the community because of

his long-time association with the'

power. in Pittsburgh. His third
asset is his far-sighted thinking
in revising our academic system.”

After moving immediately into
the Chancellor’s Office, 106 CL,
Crooke pulled up in his ﬁrmly-
padded swivel chair, pulled out
a havana cigar ready for the
ensuing interview. In his open-
ing statement he backed heartily
the guidelines set by ex-Acting
Chancellor -David Kurtzman.

“Dr. Kurtzman repeately stated
the need for a broader range of
inﬂuence in governing the Uni-

state appointees. I further plan
to broaden the community sup-
port by bringing in community
leaders from Qlakland, the North
Side, ;Herron Hill, the Hill Dis-
trict, and the Monongahela River
Wharf.”

Reporters directed most ques-
tions , to Dr. Crooke concerning

  Lovers DemandLounge

Languished Lovers Limited (LLL), a newly recognized
student organization, has demanded a loung similar to the
proposed commuters’ lounge in which its members can carry
out their business. Since membership‘ in LLL is open to all

_ al studlents, such a_ lounge would serve all the students, res-»
idents and commuters.

’ Leaders of LLL envision the
lounge as devoid of all furniture
but equipped with cushioned
ﬂoors and lighted only by birth-
day candles at the exits.

To the bewilderment of pro-
ponents of the lounge, some mem-
bers of the Administration and
faculty came out strongly against
their proposal. These criticisms
were quickly squelched, however,
when Dr. David Kurtzman, chan-
cellor, announced that such a
program “would attract high
quality students to the Universi-
ty, thus maintaining our academ-
ic standards.”

Further administration support
for the lounge came. from Helen
Pool. Rush, vice-chancellor of stu-
dent afﬁa-irs. Miss Rush noted that
she had never had any problems
with love herself. and believes
that the students, as “young, re.-
sponsible adults,” can handle the
situation well.

Dr. Morris Berkowitz, professor ,

of sociology, feels the lounge
would allow University intellec-
tuals greater freedom of expres-
sion. He also suggested brandy

be provided in the lounge to pre- '
vent dry .throats_ andpimoral _ scru--I

  

physical plant, said that the ﬁfth
and sixth, ﬂoors, CL, would be
available for use as a lounge as
soon as the new Hillman Library
is completed. Elevator service to
these ﬂoors would be extended.
Fisher \ also announced plans to
set up an emergency lounge in
Dining Rooms‘ A, B, and C of the
Student Union.

stated emphatically, “There’s. no”

totally with control of the Uni--_,

and Fricks. They built the steel

and kept us in business many. '3

years. I’d even accept a proposal
to rename the University Mellon

“I also plan to institute an oct- :

Commuters are our primary con-

cern, though all students having f

Dr. Crooke.

also announced tenative plans to

“We need a progressive program

and we must sacriﬁce a bit 7"-‘of

In a parliamentary debate two
"months ago, the William Pitt De-
bate Union agreed unanimously
. that, save for themselves, Univer-
I , sity students are “a rogue’s gal-
lery of uncouth clods.”

The resolution — “Resolved:
University students are a rogue’s
‘ gallery of uncouth c1ods”—was
defended by Government speak-
ers _Armand Hammer as Prime
1 Minister and Harry Marshmallow
 as Philatelist to the Queen.

As there was no one in the en-
tire Union who would condescend
to take the Opposition’s side, the
Government spoke to two empty
chairs.

Following the overly pompous
entrance of Speaker of the House
Coyote Soda, the member of the
?House warmed‘ up by showering
him v.'ith abusive barbs and cat-
calls. Exhorting the audience to
._“curtail your tongues, knaves,”
Soda .quelled the disturbance.

V Hammer began his indictment
-by saying, “You Know, the 0p-
" , position hasn't contend-ed one
argument of the Government, and
"you know, I believe they can't
I. produce one shred of evidence
against the resolution.” At this
point, Sy Cophant, Obsequious
"Fawner to the Speaker, hurled a
particularlycaustic insult to Ham-
mer from the Queen's Roy-al Pea-
nut Gallery to the effect that
since Hammer was the first speak-
er, the Opposition, which was
-’ nonexistent in the ﬁrst place, had
 no chance to contend anything.

' Red moustache bristling and -his
gravel voice. at fever pitch, he
charged Hammer with “deliber-
ately confusing the revered, aug-
ust Soda.”

Unperturbed, Hammer contin-

ued, saying, “You know, you go
to the 80’s classes, you go to the
Snack Bar, you go to the Tuck
Shop, and what do you see? You
see masses of illiterate goons
swarming about.”

Rising to a point of order, Pe-
ter Tammany charged that “the
Honorable Member’s last com-
ment was deplorable. I demand a
retraction.” Speaker Soda ruled
that “You, sir (Tammy), are a
cur.” Soda’s statement was met
with “Hear, hear,” from Cophant.

Marshmallow argued that “not
only are Pitt students unintelli-
gent, anti-intellectual and fool-
ish, but they actually revel in
their unintelligence, anti-intellec-
tualism, and foolishness.

Marshmallow’s speech was in-
terrupted by Madhood Marconi,
who contended that since the
examination alluded to “was for
a course in Serbo-Croatian liter-
ature, in Serbo-Croatian, it is
highly unlikely that the Honor-
able Member (Marshmallow)
would understand it.” .

Speaker Soda reprimanded Mar-
caroni for embarassaing Marsh-
mallow in this way and demand-
ed that Marconi apologize to

years. This is the last picture taken of Soda before
he was killed in duel with Madhood Marconi.

Tom Psycho reminded Marconi
that the only way in which a

Shaving close really can be comfortable! The new Norelco
Speedshaver® 30 proves it. This new electric shaves you so close,
we dare to match it with a blade. Yet it shaves comfortably. No
nicks. No cuts. No irritation. Because Norelco rotary blades
stroke whiskers ofi. ‘Floating heads‘ swing with every contour
of your face. And there's _a pop-up trimmer for neat sideburns.
Easy ‘flip-open‘ cleaning,'too. If you want to spend a little less,
try the Norelco ‘Flip-Top’ Speedshaver 20 (at right_). Great com-
fortable rotary blade shave. Just a few less trimmings. So, mister,
if you've been getting a raw deal from shaving, ‘get close with

Norelco. And make yourself comfortable! '

Bye, Bye Byrdie, the new mu-
sical now at the Strike Theatre,
is the lively and tuneful story
of the President's frantic efforts
to save his daughters from both

I". the draft and the draught. As the

ﬁlm opens we ﬁnd the President,
Linden Branch Jaundice, bailing
his elder daughter out of jail
after an all-night orgy in the Na-
tion’s Capitol.

. Early Byrd, as she is called, is
threatened to be drafted into mil-
itary service unless she can shape
up. President J aundice warns her
of the dangers she faces as a so-
cial mover, in the memorable
song, You Are Sixteen, Going on
Twenty-four.

Meanwhile, the Chief Execu-
tive has other domestic problems.
His lovely first lady, Lady Beak,
is so violent in her campaign to

- remove unsightly Billboards from

our highways and newspapers
that she has on several occa-
sions used Karate on several
Senators and even the President
himself. LBJ reminds Lady Beak
to calm down, as he sings, I’ve
Gronw Accustomed to Her Fist.

The President’s younger daugh-

~ te.r, Loose Brains Jaundice, has

“Bye Bye Byrdie”
Bill Drone’ s Bitchboard

meanwhile become infatuated
with the White House Chef, th-e
President’s cousin London Broil
Jaundice. The social repercus-
sions of this event cause the.
stunner LBJ to seize and burn
Loose Brains’ college invoice.

But this makes her, too, eligible
for the draft, and through his
nervousness the President devel-
ops a stomach uler which re-
quires surgery. And it is in this
memorable press conference scene
in the hospital bedroom where
the President first belches forth
his now-infamous, throaty ren-
dition of Scardust. ’

Meanwhile, back at the LBJ
Ranch, Early Byrd has run off
with Private Barry Sadness, the
country's leading recording ar-
tist. Before the President breaks
up this affair, the two perform a
marvelous eye-catching dance in-
terpretation of the Private’s ﬁrst
hit song, The Itsy Bitsy Teenie
Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Berets.

The picture ends on a happy
note, as President Jaundice saves
his two daughters and restores
order in the Government once
again, with the. aid of Vice-Presi-
dent Humbert Humbert Humph.
Lady Beak ends her Karate les-

Position on Spot
Editor, The Pitt News:

2 I would like to clarify my stand
on the Students from Pittsburgh
(SFP) issue.

This group was found distri-
buting copies of the Student
Handbook and War and Peace to
.prospective freshmen during the
recent Spot Preview. Spot Pre-
view is meant to give high school
seniors a look at how much fun
the University can be. They
should in no way be presented
with the more radical side ‘of the

the Editors ,

University -— hard work and
study.

It is felt that such distribution
might actually interest students
in these activities and give them
a head start on students who did
not attend Spot Preview. It is in-
conceivable that SFP did not
know the rule against distribu-
tion of literature since it is clear-
ly scratched into the sand in the
cigarette urns at the entrances
to the Cathedral.

Furthermore, I feel that this
organization is serving as a front
for Collegians Interested in Prog-
ress (CIP). A member of SFP
was actually seen carrying a copy
of a publication of CIP. I I don’t
know what the reltaionship is be-
tween the two organizations but
such‘ propaganda can subvert
readers from The Pitt News. Be-
Sides, I am always suspicious of
someone interested in progress.

We have suspended the activ-
ities fee allocations of SFP with-
out permission of the Allocations
Committee, but then one left
turn deserves another.

rnerica Relocated

To Handle Panther Publicity

, By CARL T. ROWAN

Frank Carver, University
athletic director, was sum-
moned today to Washington,
D. C., for a private confer-
ence with President Lyndon
B. Johnson. The President
was reportedly upset about Pitt’s
recent steal away from the State
Department of the Voice of
America (VOA) agency.

Under J ohnson’s administration,
the VOA was charged with the
responsibility of convincing the
countries of the world that the
United States was always right.
As Johnson recently said, “What’s
best for me is best for my great
country and is best for this beau-
tiful world in which we live.”

The VOA decided that Johnson
was too convincing on his own
and was taking all the challenge
out of their job. The agency
jumped at the chance to become
the new sports publicist here.

After many hours of frustra-
tion, The Pitt News ﬁnally man-
aged to establish contact with
George Wallace in his under-
ground post in Siberia- Wallace

Swimming Team Loses. Use

A Of Trees Pool; Coach Quits

1 Swimming coach Ben Grady
appeared in a dilemma today. nI
his mail this morning, he found
over a hundred letters of appli-
cation from high school and col-
legiate swimmers from 48 of the
50 states.

“It would not be so bad ifjust
20 or 30 asked to come here but
I do not have more than 25 schol-
arships to hand out,” Grady said.
“And since they are restricting
the use of Trees P001 to Navy
scuba divers next year, I won’t
be able to have practices during
the week.

The Navy frogmen are on tour
from Hawaii and they are reg-

iistered for the two credit co-urse

offered by Bobby Lewis. The
course prepares them for the an-
nual Army-Navy water balloon

Grady said he really does not

me keep my office and my re-

Field's outdoor pool,” athletic di-
rector Frank Carver said. “If that
does not work, the team will use

Schenley Pond. When the cold

weather comes, what we will do
is ﬂood the open stack library

All of this revamping has giv-
en the stalwart Grady a split-
ting head-ache. To remedy this,

Woops! Carver Appoints Grgurich
Hoop Coach Despite Marine Hitch

By POP GRGURICH
lt’s too bad that freshman
basketball coach Tim Grgu-
rich is commited to a two-
year hitch ‘in the Marines.
Vietnam? Maybe. He was

a pretty nice guy. He was
named yesterday as the Panthers’

‘new head basketball coach by

Athletic Director Frank Carver.

Carver made the announcement
in the front room of Gustine’s
right before lunch. ‘‘I’m proud to
be here,” Carver opened. “I’d like
to say that all future basketball
luncheons will be held here so I
can watch television.”

After his brilliant opening re-
marks, Carver explained why
Grgurich was the best possible
choice for the post vacated by
Bob Timmons, who resigned im-
mediately after Carver sat down.

“Grgo Was in great demand,”
Carver noted. “We had reports
that the Clapp Hall Chargers, Phi
Epsilon Pi, and Northwest Gene-
va State Teachers College were
all looking for a new head coach.
We at the Athletic Department
couldn’t risk losing him to our
competitors. Especially to teams
that will comprise one.-third of
our basketball schedule for next
season.”

Once Carver had mentioned
next year’s schedule, no listener
could restrain him. “We'll play
only the best,” he said. “In ad-
dition to the teams I’ve already
mentioned, We meet Duke Uni-
