Adolescent suicide increases

Matthew Thornton
For the Pitt Nevvs

The adolescent suicide rate in Pitts-
burgh and the nation has nearly tri-
pled in the last decade. Suicide has
become the second largest killer
among teens. What was of little con-
cern 10 years ago has now become
a national issue.

Dr. David Brent, an assistant pro-
fessor of child psychiatry at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, said
yesterday, in testimony to a special
House committee, ”The actual
suicide rates are at least 15 percent
higher than the nationally released
statistics.” T

In an interview on Friday, State
Representative Roy Cornell said,
”The new urgency of the problem
has led to the formation of the com-
mittee to study teen suicide and to
make recommendations for
legislative changes.”

Cornell ‘also said the expected
changes would supplement the

”hotline” system.

”The use [of the hotline system] has
really fallen off in the last two years
due to the unavailability of profes-
sionals to answer the calls,” he said.
He said one possible change would
be to develop a coping skills program
in the elementary schools.

Dr. Mary Margaret Kerr, also an
assistant professor of child psychiatry
at Pitt, said that there was a ’’fatal
flaw” in developing such a program
in the elementary schools because
they ”are not adequately prepared for
their rol|.”

There is agreement, though, on the
type of adolescent most. likely to
commit suicide. Brent said that the
teens with the highest risk are usual-
ly ”poor problem solvers, those with
psychiatric problems.”

”A large portion of the successful
suicides are among those who have
alcohol problems and ready access
to firearms,” continued Brent.

Brent's studies showed suicide vic-
tims usually threaten suicide within
a week of an attempt. ”Teens usual-
ly make their threats to their peers,

and their peers almost never violate
their friends trust,” most of them
laboring under the common
misconception that people who talk
about suicide really are not serious.
Studies have shown that these peo-
pleare serious and are the ones most
in need of help. Brent stressed the
need for ”an improvement in the
quality of assessment and treatment
of suicidal adolescents on the part of
mental health professionals.”
Suicide victims who are intoxicated

‘at the time of death are seven times

more likely to have died by firearms.
”There is a specific relationship bet-
ween alcohol abuse at the time of
death and the use of predominantly
violent means of suicide,” Brent said.

Researchers at WPIC said that the
availability of firearms to vulnerable
adolescents increases the likelihood
of suicide. -

”Young people often don't realize
that there are a number of service
organizations equipped to deal with
their problems,” Cornell said. ”We
hope to make the public more aware
of the services that are out there.”

The Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center was formally dedicated
Monday at the Westinghouse
Nuclear Center in Monroeville.
The ceremony was conducted to
thank political and governmental
leaders for their roles in helping
the center become a reality.

The center is a partnership
among the University of Pitts-
burgh, Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation. It is one of five
centers established in the past
year by the National Science
Foundation.

Supercomputer dedicated

According to CMU President
Dr. Richard Cyert, the purpose of
the center is to ”make the power
of a very fast computer available
to scientists, particularly in
academic life.”

The center currently houses a
$22 million Cray X/MP-48 super-
computer and other equipment,
making the facility the most ad-
vanced of the five in the country.
The Supercomputer was pur-
chased by a grant from the NSF
of nearly $40 million.

”This center is good news for
this region,” said Pitt President
Dr. Wesley Posvar. ”We’|l be in
the forefront of advanced science
and technology.”

”Part of the long-range plan of
acquiring the center is to make
Pittsburgh one of the major

centers of the world in the com-
puting area,” said Cyert.

Two of the other five centers
have been experiencing problems
getting off the ground. ”At this
point.,” said Cyert,”we are the
most powerful center, and have
a good chance of becoming the
most significant.”

Supercomputer Center Director
James Kasdorf said the Cray
supercomputer will be linked to
the two campuses by high—speed
communications lines, and will
enable researchers at both institu-
tions to develop and pursue new
research projects.

Kasdorf said that the Cray
X/MP-48 is the most powerful
machine of its kind, having four
processors and eight million
words of memory.

Report criticizes
med school merger

Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

A report submitted to the faculty
assembly on May 22 concluded that
the merger of two departments in the
School or Medicine has ’’become a
metaphor for dissatisfaction with the
style and for a lack of confidence in
the openness," of Health Sciences
Vice President Thomas Detre’s
leadership and methods.

Last September, four complaints
were brought before the faculty
assembly concerning the method of
the merger of biochemistry and
microbiology forming the department
of biochemistry, microbiologysand
molecular biology.

The merger was overseen by Detre,
who is also interim dean of the
Medical School.

The planning/problem-solving
committee, chaired by professor
Herbert Chesler, concluded that
complaints regarding insufficient op-
portunities for faculty to contribute to
the final decision merging the two
departments was justifiable and that
the merger occurred despite substan-
tial faculty opinion against it.

Both Chesler and University Senate
President Barbara Shore said that the
report has well served its purpose in
giving the faculty a chance to not
only voice dissatisfaction but also to
show many of the faculty that they do
indeed have a voice in the gover-
nance of the university.

”Perhaps the most important thing
that has been learned from the report,
on the faculty's part, is the impor-
tance of the university senate as a
mechanism of influence,” said
Chesler.

He also said that he hopes the ad-
ministration will recognize the need
for faculty influence in future

decisions.

Chesler said he recognized a need
for one decision-maker but that per-
son must be responsible to those his
decisions affect.

The committee reported that in the
process of inquiry it was found that,
”opposition to Dr. Detre’s leadership
has arisen, specifically in relation to
his style and procedure. An impres-
sion of imperious governance and ex-
cessive concentration of power has
created a broad apprehension which
sometimes crosses into outright fear
and mistrust.”

In a letter to Chesler, written shortly
after the report came out, Detre re-
ferred to this section as ”a fine little
innuendo at the end of the report.”
He said that if the committee was go-
ing to make such a statement, ”it
would have behooved the commit-
tee to say a word or two about how
the merger worked out.”

Shore said that it was never the in-
tention of the committee to evaluate
the effectiveness of the merger and
that it was not formed for that pur-
pose. She said the report came about
as a result of the four complaints as
to the method of the merger.

The third complaint brought forth
contended that Detre went ahead
with the merger against the advice of

both external and internal

committees.

Shortly after Detre announced

plans for several mergers in May of
1984, a subcommittee of the ex-
ecutive committee of the School of
Medicine, was formed to seek
response from experts around the
country on the proposed mergers.
Their report recommended the
mergers not be undertaken. It was
suggested by this committee that
while changes were necessary to im-

prove the School of Medicine, ”|ess '

radical solutions are available and
should be effective.

Following reception of this report,
Detre created a panel of outside ex-
perts chaired by Dr. Ronald
Estabrook. This committee concurred
with the executive subcommittee in
its report. However, in a letter to
Detre shortly after the external com-
mittee made its recommendation,
Estabrook said that he felt the merger

4 ”Opposition to Dr.
Detre’s leadership has
arisen specifically in rela-
tion to‘ his style and pro-
cedu re. ’ "

— University Senate's
planning problem solv-
mg committee

I

of the biochemistry and microbiology
departments would, in his own opin-
ion, be effective.

Estabrook said in the letter that it

was imperative that the molecular '

biology department be strengthened
for the good of the medical school
and that it would be a suitable bridge
to connect the microbiology and
biochemistry departments into one.

Ches|er's committee concluded
that Detre’s arguments against the
issue did not address the basic
complaint.

Detre said that one departmerit
would have more financial strength
than two, and that he yielded on the
basic sciences merger and on the
issue of merging physiology and
pharmacology in order to concen-
trate on a what was a compelling
need for the merger of biochemistry
and microbiology.

The fourth complaint concerned
the waiver of university senate pro-
cedure while getting the merger
approved.

President Wesley Posvar approved
the waiver and said there would have
been no complaint had he informed
Shore of his decision. The report said
the complaint could have been
avoided if Posvar had consulted the
senate prior to issuing the exception.

Because the merger took place a
year ago the benefits of the report, ac-
cording to both Chesler and Posvar,

are that there was faculty involve-‘

ment and thatthe faculty now has an
example of having its voice ;heard;

Shuttle report blasts NASA

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The long-
awaited ”Rogers Commission Report
on the Space Shuttle Challenger
Disaster” was released to the public
Monday, signalling the start of
reforms at NASA. The 265-page
document concludes the cause of the
Challenger disaster, which claimed
the lives of seven astronauts, was
faulty O-ring seals in the shuttle’s
right booster rocket. But the report
blames a ’’badly flawed” manage-
ment system at NASA for failing to
heed the warnings of engineers about
the seals. The report clearly noted
that the January 28 explosion could
have been avoided and recommends
that Nasa end its dependence on the
shuttle as the only means of putting
heavy payloads into orbit. Since the
disaster and the failure of a Titan
rocket, the nation’s space agency has
not had a means of putting satellites
into space. NASA’s response to the
report was to accept full responsibili-
tyfor the disaster. New NASA head
James Fletcher said that some of the
recommendations of the report have
already been implemented by the
agency. The report's release begins
a thorough investigation of the
disaster by Congress. Commission
Chairman William Rogers is slated to
testify this week before the House
and Senate. The'o.fficial NASA reac-

tion to the report is expected to come
later in the week from Fletcher. Con-
gressional leaders have indicated
they will sharply increase their over-
sight of NASA in the wake of the
disaster. President Reagan is ex-
pected to give his reaction to the
disaster in a news conference
Wednesday night.

Jet forced down;
Pan Am pays fine

A Pan American Airlines Boeing
747 was forced down in Peru Mon-
day, after violating Peruvian air
space. Pan Am officials said that an
erroneous flight plan given to the
pilot caused the plane to fly over
Peruvian airspace on its route from
Buenos Aires .to Los Angeles. The
United States does not have an air
traffic agreement with Peru, which
apparently prompted it to force the
plane down. Some passengers on the
plane said that a military jet escorted
the plane until it landed at Lima Air-
port, but Peruvian authorities denied
that a military jet was invovled. The
plane with 105 passengers sat on the
ground for nearly eight hours before
being allowed to leave ——- it was
allowed to leave only after Pan Am
paid a $5000 fine.

Waldheim wins;
chancellor resigns

VIENNA, Austria — Sunday,
Austrian voters elected former United
Nations Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim president, despite allega-
tions that Waldheim was involved in
Nazi activities during World War II.
Several Israeli officials and famed
Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal have
said that they have evidence show-
ing Waldheim not only knew of Nazi
atrocities when he was a German of-
ficer stationed in Yugoslavia during
the war but participated in them.
Waldheim has repeatedly denied
such accusations. Waldheim’s elec-
tion spelled the defeat of a Socialist
Party candidate for the first time in 16
years, which prompted Chancellor
Fred Sinowatz to resign. Reactions to
Waldheim’s election have been mix-
ed. Israel recalled its ambassador to
Austria for ”consultations.” The
Israelis have not yet said whether the
move will be permenant. White
House Spokesman Larry Speakes said
that President Reagan will send
Waldheim the usual diplomatic let-
ter of congratulations. The Justice
Department officials said that since
Waldheim is now a head of state he
will not be barred from the United

 
  

States. Earlier, several American
organizations called for a ban against
Waldheim because of his_alleged
Nazi past. Meanwhile, West Ger-
many congratulated Waldheim, and
its president said that the two coun-
tries will continue to be good
neighbors.

Abortion clinic

WICHITA, Kan.— An abortion
clinic was hit by a pipe bomb that rip-
ped through the entrance of the
building Monday. No injuries were
reported, but authorities said that the
blast caused extensive damage. The
clinic's owner, Dr. George Tiller, said
that he has received numerous bomb
threats in the last few years called
Monday's blast anarchy. Tiller said
that he believes anti-abortion groups
are responsible for the blast.

challenge life or death decisions
parents make for babies with severe

decided that the administration im-
properly attempted to override paren-
tal wishes and to pressure hospitals
and doctors to provide medical care
that might extend the lives of severely
deformed or gravely ill babies. The
decision was sparked by highly
publicized cases in Indiana and New
York and will not affect existing state

states, does not have a law which

Depression:

Frances Sansig
For The Pitt News

presented six years of data on the use of two kinds of
treatments for depression in possibly one of the most
carefully designed studies in this area. Imber focused
on interpersonal therapy and cognitive psychotherapy.

Interpersonal therapy, a treatment developed by
Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman ”is based on
the assumption that depression always occurs in the
context of disturbed interpersonal relationships,” Im-
ber said. ,

’’It happens that at times these troubled relationships
have something to do with the onset of depression,”
he added, ”and sometimes exacerbate already existing
problems.”

Imber explained that the focus of the treatment is to
help patients identify and learn to deal with their in-
terpersonal problems.

The other treatment,’ cognitive psychotherapy,
developed by Aaron Beck, is ”a depression that tends
to be closely related with distorted perceptions (cogni-
tions) a person would have of the world around him
or her,” said Imber.

This would include their daily activities, the people
they associate with, and their ”dysfunctional” view of
themselves.

Stanley lmber, a professor of psychiatry at Pitt, has.

Pitt prof examinestreatments

”The ‘person would have a sense of hopelessness and
feelings of inadequacy,” he said. This form of
psychotherapy focuses on identifying what these
dysfunctional attitudes are and working to change
them.

lmber said this was not the first scientific research

in this area. However, it is the first used in a very,

carefully designed study.

"All of the treatment forms were used in this research
project —‘ the two brief forms of psychotherapy,‘ a drug
(imipramine) control group and a placebo group. The
researchers were highly experienced and were train-
ed and certified by the institutes that conducted the
research,” he said.

Imber said that in the past there has not been much
focus on medication as an effective treatment for
depression. Now this is starting to change. In the last
15 years or so, a numberof drugs were developed to
treat certain disorders, including depression. ,

”Because they've been relatively new, they’ve been
getting a lot of attention. In some cases, the best treat-
ment for outpatient depression is imipramine. Why
bother with psychotherapy if there is an effective
medication?” said Jmber.

"Fifty to sixty percent of all patients who should profit
from imipramine will profit, others do not respond, and
there are some patients who cannot take the drug for
a variety of reasons,” he said.

Volunteers needed
for upcoming study

Deborah Weber

For the Pitt News

Volunteers are needed from the
Pittsburgh and Greensburg, area to
participate in Pitt's Graduate School
of Public Health study on hyperten-
sion in the elderly. It is part of a larger
study being funded by the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and
the National Institute on Aging.

”We are looking for 300 people
over the age of 60 who have isolated
systolic hypertension,” said Lewis
Kuller, chairman and professor of
epidemiology, GSPH. Additionally,
to participate in Systolic Hyperten-
sion in the Elderly Program, they can-
not have had bypass surgery within
the past two years or experienced a
heart attack within the past six
months.

Isolated systolic hypertension is dif-
ferent from regular high ' blood
pressure in that the upper number, or
systolic number, of a person's blood
pressure measurement increases in-
stead of the lower or -diastolic

number as in regular hypertension.
Isolated systolic hypertension is be-
ing seen with increasing frequency in
the elderly.

The department of epidemiology
(main campus) which is doing the
research is including the Greensburg
campus in the study.

"We have worked with the
Greensburg campus previously, and
because of the closeness and the
large population of the area, it is an
ideal location for the study of
epidemiology and preventive
medicine. Oakland staff can easily
commute between the two campuses
cutting the cost of hiring additional
people,” said Kuller.

George F. Chambers, president of
the Greensburg campus said, ”We
are pleased with the move and we
are hoping something more extensive
will grow out of it; possibly a degree
program, -

”The [Greensburg] students will
take care of the preliminary things-
recruiting volunteers, getting
samples, and the actual research will
take place on the Oakland campus,”
said Chambers.

  Media Hype

Being the president is not all that it is cracked.up
to be. You have to deal with the gripes of 240 million
people, terrorist threats from Third World countries
and, worst of all, you have to deal with the news
media. There should be no problem with news agen-
cies in a country founded on freedoms, including
freedom of speech. But there are.

Difficulties between the executive branch of
government and the news media are not new.
Richard Nixon had little to say to members of the
press. They, in turn, had a great deal to say about him
-— none of it too flattering. A president’s rapport with
the press can make or break him. In fact, the press
has been so unforgiving to the president that the
American people placed more trust in Walter
Cronkite than in former President Jimmy Carter.

Take our current president, Ronald Wilson Reagan.
He was an actor. He was the governor of California.
He developed -an incomparable style that has brought
him nothing but success, especially in his relation-
ship with the press. His warm, grandfatherly image
sheltered him from the biting cold of scrutiny during
his first term. In his second term, however, the presi-
dent became more outspoken, a little more radical.
After all, he could concentrate on being the presi-
dent without the worries of being re-elected. His basic
premises didn't change, but they did gain new shades
of meaning. Needless to say, the watchdog press saw
a change and began to ask questions.

The questions posed by the media were nothing
but inquiries into national matters. The media didlnot

have Reagan on its hit-list. The reaction that Reagan
and his press people gave would have you think
otherwise.

There is no reason for cat—fights between the press
and the president. Each has a job to do, and if both

- the president and the media perform their respective

jobs professionally, then there should be no problem.
Keep it up, Mr. Donaldson.

That's fine; it's certainly a newswor-
thy topic. But there was a flood that
affected an area a little closer to home
last week. The Pitt News either didn't
know about it.(unlikeIy), or decided
to buckle under administrative
pressure and ignore it (very likely).

Last Tuesday a sewage pipe on the
ceiling of the 12th floor of Tower C
ruptured, sending sewer water all
over the 12th floor and down the
elevator shafts, flooding at least 75
rooms on its way. The worst damage
was contained to the 12th and 11th
floors, but the entire building had the
pleasure of living with the stench of
sewer water.

The water continued to pour from
the ruptured pipe for at least .20
minutes. Maintenance people were
‘on the spot pretty fast, and for that
they are to be commended. But that's
where the commendation stops.

The Housing Office has done
basically nothing since then. The Of-

Changes in Attitudel Greg Anater “

fice of Residence Life, which, if I’m
not mistaken, is there to help make
life in the dorms bearable, has done
even less. Neither office made any at-
tempt to evacuate the building or
even the floors affected after the
flood. The residents whose rooms
were damaged were relocated to
other rooms in the building. The
Housing Office, notorious for its
often bothersome notices in
mailboxes, never sent anything to us.
No one issued any kind of a state-
ment explaining what had happened.

We were instructed by the RAs to
make a list of the damages we sus-
tained, and send it to OUR
HOMEOWNER’S
COMPANY. The university has taken
no responsibility for this event, even
though they are liable.

Well I know for a fact that the pipe
that broke had been leaking for at
least two months prior to the flood.
Housing knew that this was going to
happen and they could have stopped
It.

I would like to know why this has
been swept under the rug. I would
like to see the Housing and
Residence Life Offices at least admit
that this happened in the first place.

INSURANCE I

Admission of guilt and payment for
damages is but a dream, but would

. be greatly appreciated.

I think that this matter deserves to
be further investigated. This is a stu-
dent publication, isn’t it? Why not
cover a story that affects students?

Father's Day:An overlooked holiday

This Sunday is perhaps the most
overlooked holiday on our calendar:
Father’s Day. For most people, it's an
excuse to buy the old man either Old
Spice, a tie or a power tool, each of
which is usually purchased at a fine
department store like Sears or K-Mart.

Father's Day should be more than
unoriginal gifts and boring cards.
Father's Day is a celebration of
manhood. A day set aside when the
whole world can acknowledge that
it is not so terrible to be traditionally
masculine.

’’Real men" are becoming an en-
dangered species. I compare myself
to my fathergand the changing roles
and norms of manhood become
made blatantly obvious. He's meat
and potatoes; I bake ‘my own quiche
Lorraine. Give him a $4 bottle of col-
ogne and he's dressed to kill. I, on
the other hand, spend more money
on toiletries than my mother. That's
fine though; I'm a hip, new, '80s
man, and he's a vestige of another
time.

As women have ri_sen, and con-
tinue to rise from ‘their tradition‘ roles,

..-it ..has.s.qrldenIy. become luncool foil ” -

men to refuse to do housework or
other ”feminine” tasks. Men are no
longer allowed to be strong, silent
types. We are now expected to learn
to feel, express ourselves and, if we
are liberated enough, cry.

Contemporary men have changed.
We use mousse and styling gel. We
pierce our ears and color-coordinate
our wardrobes. We look forward to
”parenthood” and being our wives’
best friends.

To men who were our age 40 years
ago, we must seem like an entire
generation of sissies, not men. So
what? We’re better prepared to relate
to women, be they co-workers,
girlfriends, friends, sisters, and some-
day wives and daughters.

Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda tell
me that my liberated friends and I are
better than men-like my father. For
a time I believed them. We may be
better equipped to deal with our in-
terpersonal relationships, but men
from the old school have a sense of
responsibility and a love of hard work
that our generation seems to be
missing. E

 

..  . 

I.look at how far my father has
come since he was my age and my
head spins. I ask myself: Are Clinique
skin supplies and an open mind go-
ing to get me anywhere in the next
40 years? Don’t get me wrong —— I
have no intention of putting away my
moisturizer and following the
footsteps of Rambo, but I am
developing a respect for old-
fashioned manhood. I'm trying to
understand men who grew up in a
world much different than mine.
Maybe I'll learn a lesson or two along
the way. I'm getting tired of ’’Phil
Donahue masculinity.” I don't want
to get rid ofall of it, just parts. It will
leave a few holes in my personality,
but I'll be able to fill them with the
examples of men like Dad. 7

So do something original IOF
Father's Day. If you get along well

with your father, congratulations, 9”" Q

joy him. If you don't, why not make
a move to improve the situation.
Remember to take some time out this
weekend to say some words too
many fathers don't hear enough: I
love you Dad.

Anoui|h’s mirthful absurdity

David Zuchowski

Staff Writer
Rating System — Each play is given
from 0 to 5 stars, five stars being best.

Waltz of the Toreadors , set in
1910 in French Morocco, is a farce
a la Moliere by Jean Anouilh. Marital
and romantic infidelities in the tradi-
tion of French philanderers, with a
Victorian code of honor, abound.
With a lavish setting and lush color-
ful period costumes, this well-acted
play is an olio of high camp,
philosophical reflection and an ironic
interpretation of life, marriage, love
and sexual role playing. Anouilh has

a tendency to the absurd, but the play
is never boring, moves at a crisp
pace, provides an evening of mirthful
entertainment and deserves a much
larger audience. A hilarious vignette
follows the surprise ending, sum-
marizing the theme of the play. Most
of the members of the large cast revel
in their roles, although a few of the
minor characters give forgettable per-
formances. If you are in the area the
play is definitely worth seeing. Stag-
ed on the beautiful, rustic
Washington and Jefferson College
Campus, the Waltz of the Toreadors
runs through June 14 on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. ,

Hughes cleverly captures the teenage dilemma

Bruce Kasrel
Fof The Pitt News

Few directors are as successful as
John Hughes at tuning into what
teen-age life is reallylike. Even fewer
are as visionary or ambitious. With
16 Candles, he delighted audiences
with hilariously stereotypical
characters and then enlightened us all
with the more serious side of youth
in The Breakfast Club. With Ferris
Bueller’s Day Off, Hughes has re-
placed the profitable yet predictable
”teenage dilemma” with a carefree
and engaging piece about taking it
easy and enjoying all of life's little
pleasures. .

Since Hughes wrote, coproduce
and directed Bueller, faithful fans will
recognize many of his trademarks;
the typical high school setting, the
hopelessly naive parents, clever
dialogue and a slightly distorted
sense of realism. As with all of his
films, Hughes can turn simple situa-
tion into a full-length movie. In 76
Candles, it was a neglected 16th bir-
thday; in Club, it was a weekend
detention. In Bueller, Hughes takes
the events of a day skipped from
school and blows them up into com-
ic proportions.

But the similarities end there. In-

   
   

Pittsburgh's own Sponges soak up the crowd excitement during
the filming of their debut video in the William Pitt Union.

stead of calling upon previous
Hughes alumni like Andrew McCar-
thy or Anthony Michael Hall, the-
director chose to use a fresh and ex-
perienced cast. The choice proves to
be a wise one, as their performances
are what give Bueller its winning
edge.

The brightest performance of the
bunch comes from Matthew
Broderick in the title role. As the
larger—than-life Ferris, Broderick

 

assumes the boyish charm and assur-
ing grin that the part calls for. Since
everybody likes Ferris and he always
gets his way, the character could easi-
ly have come off as cocky and con-
ceited. Broderick’s playful man-
nerisms and subtle wit generate a
likable character that justifies his
schoolwide popularity.

l Lynne Griesemer/The Pitt News

On Broadway, as Eugene Morris
Jerome in Neil Simon's Tony Award
winning autobiographical plays
Brighton Beach Memoirs and Biloxi
Blues, Broderick’s role was filled with
clever asides to the audience. Hughes
recognized Broderick’s ability to win
over the audience with an inside joke
and uses this technique throughout
the movie. These chats with the
camera not only provide the movie
with some hysterically insightful

dialogue, but also give the characters
and movie a solid backbone.

Of course what good is a day off
if you have no one with whom to en-
joy it. Joining Ferris on his one-day
adventure are his hypochondriac best
friend, Cameron Frye, and his steady,
Sloane Peterson. ‘

Cameron is the opposite of Ferris

' in every respect. He hates his parents,

school and life in general. As Ferris
tells the audience ”He’s the only
person I know who feels better when
he's sick.” He constantly tries to get

Cameron to lighten up, but his valiant

efforts are fruitless. Ferris does,
however, convince him to use his
father's treasured 1961 Ferrari 250
GT California as their mode of
transport. Of course something bad
happens to the car, and instead of
becoming more pessimistic, he gains
a totally new outlook on life.

As Frye, Alan Ruck almost steals
the show from Broderick’s grasp. He

. /'

The Pitt News, June.1 1,-11986

does not talk to the camera or have
any really funny lines, but his attitude
is so bleak that one feels sorry for the
guy. Ruck is a perfect complement to
Broderick. Both actors have extensive
experience in theater, and their per-
formances give the movie a
delightfully natural flavor.

Unfortunately, three is a crowd as
far as Sloane is concerned. Mia Sara,
fresh from her forgettable film debut
in Legend, registers a lackluster per-
formance. She is supposed to be Fer-
ris’s foundation and more mature bet-
ter half. She may look at things in a
more mature way, but we never see
it. Sara does little more than present
a pretty face. Compounding Sara’s
flat acting, Hughes does little more
than create a shallow and predictable
icon. This is the only dark spot in an
otherwise sparkling cast and
screenplay. ’

Hughes deliberately created
another cardboard character in the
school's principal, Dean Rooney.
When left to the hands of the brilliant
comedy acting of Jeffrey Jones,
Rooney takes on the character of a
lively and hysterically funny
"villain.” As Rooney desperately tries
to catch Ferris in the act and make
an example of him, Jones captures
the essence of the person so well that
you almost want him to get the
elusive Bueller. _ ,

With a combination of the superb
acting of Broderick, Ruck and Jones,
and the funny script, humorous situa-
tions and Hughes’ realistic characters,
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is bound to
be a smash hit. I think the words of
Ferris himself best sum up the mean-
ing of the movie: ”Life moves pretty
fast; if you don’t look around, you
could miss it.” So take a day off, and
while you're at it go see this movie.
You'll have fun and gain a greater ap-
preciation of the benefits of taking it
easy.

A delectable alternative for the itinerant diner

By Thomas Ferguson

' Sta ff Writer

The delightful vernal atmosphere
of Tarquinio’s Vintage House is a
refreshing change of scenery after
traveling along Route 22 to Mur-
raysville. An intimately subdued
cocktail lounge rests off to the left,

A. I « and the secluded ”Wine Cellar” ban-

quet hall can comfortably ac-
comodate up to 150 patrons. This in-
viting family restaurant, specializing
in traditional Italian recipes, is a com-
mendable alternative for the itinerant
Pittsburgh diner.

Of the 42 wine selections listed,
vintner/host Ron Tarquinio especially
recommends five exemplary ltalian
imports. From the top of the list, the

0‘ Strozzi Vernaccia proved to be a

" a«:.I.€._.

monumental choice. Dubbed the
”wine of popes,” and mentioned in
Dante’sDivine Comedy, it is delicate
and full-bodied. Given its history, the
Strozzi Vernaccia is a delectable elix-
ir of the imagination.

One of the most outstanding
features of the Vintage House is the
extensive hot and cold salad and ap-
petizer bar. For an additional $2, the
effusion of corn fritters, glazed car-
rot tips, ratatouille, and garden and
pasta salads was a palatable and
bountiful bargain. The seafood bis-
que was thick, rich and brimming
with delicate morsels of shrimp and
crab; however, the dried parsley gar-
nish was unnecessary, and even pe-
jorative. ”Funghi con Granchio”
were bulbous mushrooms caps
stuffed with a tangy, spongy crabmeat

filling, topped with crumbled
croutons and grated Parmesan. The
beginning courses were a meal in
themselves.

salad and your choice of fettucine,
baked potato, rice pilaf or spaghetti.
l heartily recommend one of the
pasta offerings since they are expert-
ly homemade. The marinara sauce
was savory and distinctive. The fet-
tucine Alfredo was a decent diversion
accompanying the ”Vitel|o Roulades
con Granchio.” Roulades of milk-fed
veal slices were somewhat inap-
propriately stuffed with the familiar
crabmeat filling, then sauteed in a
bold Marsala wine sauce. The use of
lumped or shredded crab meat
would have been an improvement.
The ”Gambretti E Aragosta Pate||a”
was most compensatory. Succulent

marinated shrimp and sweetish
langostinos were sauteed in luscious
scampi butter with white wine: No
complaints whatsoever.

The desserts were a mouth-
watering delight, enhanced by
amaretto. The Crepe Mirtilli was
filled with blueberries and a cream
cheese chiffonade. ”Torta Cioc-
calato” is a heavily texturted
chocolate layer cake with rich butter
fudge icing. The ”do|ci” were the
most heavenly helpings of the
plenteous feast.

Tarquinios’s Vintage House is
located at .4430 William Penn
Highway, Route 22 in Murraysville.
Prices are slightly above average, but
most major credit cards are accepted.

Smith invited back to tryouts

John Enright
Assistant Sports Editor

Charles Smith, whose special peti-
tion to the U.S. Basketball Team's
coaching staff was originally denied,
has received a second chance.

Pitt's 6-10 junior power forward
will leave Pittsburgh this Friday for
Tucson, Ariz., where he will join 17
other players competing to make the
12 player squad that will compete in
the World Championship Games in
Madrid, Spain, later this summer.

Smith was one of 47 players invited

to the first tryouts in Colorado Springs
from May 15-19. But due to a prior
academic commitment, he was not
able to make the trip. Pitt sent a
special petition to the U.S. coaching
staff requesting that Smith be able to
try out for the squad in Tucson in
June. Danny Manning of Kansas and
Tommy Amaker of Duke sent similar
petitions. The only difference was
that Manning’s and Amaker’s peti-
tions were approved, while Smith‘s
was denied.
‘ Pitt assistant coach John Calipari
explained, ”Charles felt that it would
be better to stay here in Pittsburgh
and work on his studies. The U.S.
coaching staff, headed by Lute Olson
of Arizona, felt that it wouldn't be fair
to the other players who went to the
first tryouts for a lot of kids to miss
the original tryouts and still get a se-
cond chance. So they kept Amaker
and Manning, but Charles was out.
They told him if anyone wasn’t able
to make it to Tucson, he would be
the first player they would call.”

And call they did. Last week head
coach Larry Brown of Kansas
telephoned his former assistant,
Calipari, and told him that Manning
could not make the tryouts because
of a knee injury. Olson and his staff

soon followed suit, and called Pitt to
invite Smith to Tucson.

Calipari could not be happier for
Pitt's star player. ”Charles has been
working real hard this summer. He’s

been in the weight room and on the ,

basketball court a lot. When he found
out his petition was denied, he didn’t
quit, he just worked harder," said
Calipari. ’’I told Charles when he was
called back that his hard work really
paid off.”

Now there is only one thing Smith
has to do — make the squad. With
many stars among the 18 players,
such as David Robinson of Navy,
Reggie Williams of Georgetown,
Tom Hammonds of Georgia Tech,
and Joe Wolf of North Carolina, the
competition will be tough, but
Smith's assistant coach is confident
he will do well.

”The important thing is for Charles
to go out and play the way he is
capable of playing. He doesn't need
to worry about winning during the
tryouts. All he has to do is play with
confidence,” explained Calipari. ”He
is a very, very good player.”

Indeed he is, but Smith did stum-
ble through his sophomore cam-
paign, and the consensus was that his
play was disappointing last year.

But Calipari feels that Smith is
ready to bounce back. ”There was a
tremendous amount of pressure on
Charles last year. The fans’ expecta-
tion level for him was very, very
high,” said Calipari. ’’I really feel you
will see a different ballplayer next
season.”

What about Smith moving to the
center position, a position he vowed
never to play? ”Charles doesn’t care
where he plays, he just wants to
win," said Calipari. '

And that is exactly the kind of at-
titude that should get Smith one of
the 12 roster spots on the U.S. team.

National Team.

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Matt Stennett came to Pitt as a high
school All-America running back
from nearby Shaler High in Glen-
shaw, Pa.

He rushed for 3,354 yards and
scored 31 touchdowns at Shaler dur-
ing his three year career, arid was
such a tremendous athlete that
Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer
recruited him as a wishbone
quarterback.

But now, four years later, Pitt’s Matt
Stennett is not running for
touchdowns or gaining yards in the
Pitt Panther backfield.

Stennett has decided he isn't even
going to play football anymore. In-
stead, he is going to steal bases, catch
fly balls and drive in runs.

Yes, Stennett, 5-11, 182, has opted
for baseball. A three year letter-
winner on the Pitt baseball team, he
was the 11th round pick of the
Houston Astros in last week’s
amateur free-agent draft.

Stennett quickly signed a profes-
sional contract with the Astros and
will report to their Class A team in
Auburn, N.Y., foregoing his senior
year of eligibility at Pitt.

Panther football coach Mike Gott-
fried wasn’t surprised by Stennett’s
decision. ”I talked to Matt about sign-
ing a _ pro contract and that is
something he told me he wanted to
try,” said Gottfried. "I wasn't sur-
prised at all by his decision. I'm hap-
py for him." .

Pitt's Cales mith has een given seco chance to make the U.S.

Stennett’s decision caps an unusual
college career for a player who was
supposed to make Panther fans forget
about Tony Dorsett. ,

In fact, he never even got that
chance. In his freshman season he
was redshirted because of an injury,
and the following spring he was
moved from running back to flanker
by former Pitt coach Foge Fazio.

At that position Stennett fell into
obscurity, catching only 25 passes for ‘
213 yards and no touchdowns in
three injury—filled seasons. Last year
Stennett was a starter, but he missed
seven games because of a broken
collarbone.

”/ wasn’t surprised at all by
his. decision.”
Mike Gottfried

But, while Stennett was lost in the
Pitt football shuffle, he was one of the
main attractions on the Panther
baseball team coached by Bobby
Lewis.

The baseball field is where the
talented Stennett found his niche.
Playing center field he was one of the
top Pitt players during his three
seasons.

Stennett earned All-Big East honors
his sophomore season, while
finishing his three year career with a
.316 average, 17 doubles, four triples
and 13 home runs. He also added 44
RBI, 26 stolen bases and 78 runs
scored during his 80 games played
as a Panther. I“

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

Obviously, Stennett's baseball
career was much better than his foot-
ball success.

But the loss of Stennett puts a dent
in the Panthers already thin receiv-
ing corps. Pitt returns five receivers
who caught a total of only 58 passes
last season.

Returning to Pitt is leading receiver
from 1985, senior Chuck Scales, who
grabbed 34 passes for 446 yards and
four touchdowns. Beyond that Pitt is
very inexperienced. ‘

”Anytime you lose a quality
receiver it’s going to hurt,” said Gott-
fried. ”But I think we will develop
some good young receivers at fall
camp. I like the talent of the players
we have at that position, and plus, we
have a couple good freshmen (Hosea
Heard from Valdosta, Ga., and Henry
Tuten from Camden, NJ.) coming in
this fall.''

The players that Gottfried likes are
junior Michael Stewart (6-4, 200),
sophomore Reggie Williams (6-2,
185) and redshirt freshman Darrin
Gillaspie (6-3, 185). All three have
shown great promise in the past, but
none of them is a proven player.

They will have to prove themselves
this fall. Gottfried’s nature as an of-
fensive coach is to play wide open
football with an all out aerial attack.
Therefore, he needs quantity, not just
quality, at the receiver position.
”We’l| use four receivers a lot so we
need to develop these kids atcamp,”
added Gottfried.

Hopefully, fall camp will provide
ample time for Gottfried to find the
receivers to do the job.

The Pitt News, June’ '141,‘1986T

Davisto stay, but will he play?

The summer months are a very dull

time on the Pitt sports scene, so rather
than bore you with stories nobody
cares to read, I'll give you my views
on recent sports news.
0 Pitt sophomore running back Brian
Davis was recently quoted as saying
he has no intention to transfer. Davis,
who was suspended from the team
by Coach Mike Gottfried during
spring workouts, will do battle with
junior Charles Gladman and
sophomore Craig Heyward for the
starting tailback position.

Heyward’s problems are well
known, while Gladman has had his
share of problems adjusting to the
disciplinary methods of Gottfried. I
believe the starting tailback this fall
will be the player with the best at-
titude, not the best moves on the

field. I would put my money-on’

Gladman to be that player.

John Enright

0 Panther wide receiver Matt Stennett
has decided to forego his last year of
collegiate football eligibility to play
minor league baseball for the

‘ Houston Astros.

Stennett was one of the most ex-
perienced receivers on the team,
which shows just how shaky the Pitt
receiving corps is.

You see, Stennett caught a measly
25 passes for 213 yards in three
seasons for Pitt.

0 The Pittsburgh Pirates made a big
mistake in rushing 21-year-old out-

fielder Barry Bonds to the majors two .

weeks ago. Bonds’ marvelous athletic
talent will help him survive his first
season in the league, but I feel a full
year of minor league ball in Hawaii
still would have been the best thing
for him. '

0 By the way, Bonds’ arrival in Pitts-
burgh was supposed to cut the play-
ing time of the other Pirate out-
fielders, R.J. Reynolds, Joe Orsulak
and Mike Brown.

To this point, the only player who
has been sitting the bench is Brown.
Obviously, he is in manager Jim
Ley|and’s doghouse. But what's next?
0 Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback
David Wood|ey’s recent retirement
at the age of 27 came as a big sur-
prise to everyone. Possibly,
Woodley, who was under the fans’
wrath by the end of last season, did
not want a hostile situation to get
worse, as it did with former Steeler
signal caller Cliff Stoudt.

0 The NBA Championship series be-

’ tween the Houston Rockets and

Boston Celtics exposed one very in-
teresting situation besides the ob-
vious —— Boston is the best team in
the league.

While Houston's Akeem Olajuwon
showed that he is the best center in
the league, one of his teammates
could be even better. Ralph Sampson
is a good power forward for the
Rockets, but if he played center for
a full NBA season he, not Akeem,
would be numero uno at that
position.

0 While he is not a guaranteed future
NBA player, Pitt junior. Demetre'us
Gore has the talent to make it in the
pros. We always tried to find a pro

Lloyd is a better outside shooter

0 Getting back to Pitt football. Will
we ever see Joe Felitsky in a game
again? I doubt it.

The junior quarterback’s career has
turned sour since he transferred to Pitt
from Notre Dame two years ago. The
former Central Catholic High School
star should have stayed at South

0 Although he went through the NBA
finals without getting into. a fight, I
still detest Celtic guard Danny Ainge
with a passion.

As a good friend of mine once said,

after watching the league's No. 1
crybaby get into a scuffle on TV, ”I
want a sports fantasy. I want to fight
Danny Ainge!”
0 The Pirates selection of Arkansas
third baseman Jeff King as the
number one pick in the amateur free-
agent draft was a good decision by
the Pirate brass, simply because King
was the best prospect available.

But now it's time the Pirates start
developing some quality pitchers.

And I don't mean one or two, but five
or six. Pittsburgh has a much im-
proved team, but they will find
themselves in last place at the end of
the season with their present pitching
staff. I

0 The Pirates’ home record of 9-21
for games played through Sunday is
yet another example of the bad luck
that has plagued the franchise for the
last three years.

If the Bucs’ losing ways continue
at Three Rivers, then you can expect
the club to fall short of the one
million mark in attendance. This is
not only a goal, but a necessity if the
franchise hopes to be successful in
this city.
0 Louisiana State basketball coach
Dale Brown is in the news again. He
has made it clear that he wants to sign
7-1 Soviet basketball star Arvadis
Sabonis to an athletic scholarship, get
this, in the interest of world peace.

is he kidding? Seriously though,
don't let Brown fool you. He could
care less about world peace. All he
cares about is returning his team to
the Final Four in 1987.

Brown is so two-faced he wouldn't
even be a good used-car salesman.

. 0 Lee McRae’s performance at the

NCAA Track and Field Champion-
ships this past weekend, winning the
men's 100-meter dash, goes to prove
one thing.

-While the Charles Smiths and
Charles Gladmans receive the most
media attention at the university,
McRae quietly continues to be, in-
disputably, Pitt’s best athletic
performer.
