CA5 C0509’ Files 5”” Student Questions Fines .

by LARRY PANSINO

Last week the CAS Cabinet an
nounced their intentionto file suit
on Tuesday against The Under-
graduate Academic Review for an
alleged violation of an agreement
with the Allocations Committee
concerning the publication of all
course evaluations. The UAR had
planned consultation with
teachers before including an eval-
uation, a policy that Cabinet Chair-

_ man Ron Eskin said "defeats

ntlieir constitutionally_,stated pur-

- “pose” of helping students choose

at

courses. The object of the suit is

' too have all funds t'or the UAR
cut off until the questioned policy
is rescinded.

"The purpose of the UAR is to
serve , students," Eskin said.
"This policy strikes us as being
wrong because it eliminates all
bad reviews. No bad reviews
means a large amount of decision-
making power is taken away from
the students. Furthermore, the
UAR is already incomplete and its
language is repetitive and inade-
quate."

Eskin will not be satisfied with
a simple switch -back to the old

_;:.policy of evaluations. “The rea-
lsoning behind their decision ‘was

to get more courses, evaluated.
We too want to see more courses

all ,

Against UAR's Policies  

printed in the UAR. Perhaps
some form of encouragement on
the part of professors will help
with this problem.” (The action
is based upon the UAR's use of
student funds for an activity, Es-
kin claims, does not serve its
benefactors as intended.)

The suit resulted from the in-
structions given to Eskin by the
CAS Cabinet last Thursday to take,
action that would cause the publi-
cation to revise their new policy.
Eskin channeled his suit through
the Legal Awareness Committe.
The Judicial Board will decide the
case. -

ed to bring it to the attention of
the Student Affairs Advisory
Council at their next meeting.

Applicant

Nguyen Thi 'l‘uan Anh, « daughter of South Vietnamise President
'l’hieu. has applied for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences at

Pitt. She plans to enter during the spring term. according to

t y spokesman.

Universi-

Anh. aged 18." is graduating from Pensionnate Mary Threce in
Grand Lancy. France ., and wishes to pursue a degree in economics at

Pitt.

Her finance has also applied to Pitt’s Graduate School of Public

and International Affairs.

Thieu’s nephew. Hoang Duc .Nha. attended a two month training
course offered by the Graduate School for Public and International Af-

fairs in 1967.

The University has not announced whether Anh or her fiance have

unpaid invoices and explain the
situation. They must also show
proof that they areyto receive aid.

"The award letter from either
the University or from the state.

WPGH. Returns to Air
At A New Frequency

by BOB SKELTON

WPGH. Pitt's capus radi sta-
tion. plans major changesin its
broadcasting and programming
format when it returns to the air
on Jan. 5. 1973.

According to Ed Shaffer, sta-
tion general manager, WPGH will
broadcast at a new frequency next
term. Campus radio» listeners will
turn to the 640 spot on the AM ra-
dio dial instead of the former 820
location. He indicated the new fre-
quency was a_dopted because
broadcasts from two local_Pitts-
burgh stations‘—WAMO (860 AM)
and WEDO _(830 AM) weredrown-
ing out the Pitt signal.

The change did not require ap-
proval from the Federal Commun-
ications Commission (FCC) since

-WPGH has a closed circuit broad-

cast, exempting it from federal
regulations.

'In another major change. WPGH
will reduce its broadcast sched-
ule from a 24 hour day to 18 hours.
Beginning Jan. 10, 1973. the sta-
tion will air programs from 8 am:
to 2 a.m. In addition, the station
will feature exclusive coverage of
Pitt hockey games. '

To celebrate its new broadcast-
ing format, station disc jockies
will participate in a five day
broadcast marathon. They will
work in pairs on six-hour shifts.
From noon on Jan. 5 until mid-
night of Jan. 9, WPGH will broad-
cast from the Tower's lobby and
promote a fund raising campaign

Services in Focus

, ealtli

Health Care for ' undergraduate
women was the topic of a month-
long study undertaken by an Un-

dergraduate Women's Union Com- _

mittee. The findings of this study
were reported at a session of the
Women’s Studies Colloquium on
Monday.

_Pam Steffey. co-‘chairperson of
the ommittee on Health Care
Study, said that information was
collected concerning gynecologi-
cal services and abortion referals
available through Planned Par-
enthood. the Free Clinic, the Pitt
Student Health Center. and p_ri-
vate physicians. .

Planned Parenthood was laud-
ed as being “very‘thorough” in
their patient follow-ups. Methods
of contraception available through
Planned Parenthood include the

condom, foam, and the birth con-
trol pill. Costs at the downtown
office vary with the patient’s in-
come; pills are $1.60 per month.

At the Student Health Center.‘

gynecological examinations are
free if the student has student
health insurance. Though she

cited improvements made since‘

last year. Steffey "reported that
the committee was still not satis-
fied with the Health Centers
services for women.

Pittsburgh Free Clinic and the
East Liberty office of Planned
Parenthood are both free. but the
Free Clinic has an overcrowding
problem. -

A survey of examinations by
private physician found costs" to
be_ “outlandish,” charging $15 to
$20 per visit, plus extra fees for

tests. Some physicians were

for Children’s Hospital. Over $200 _ ;-_.
was collected by the station last 1, ;'?'~
year. ' 
Last week, WPGH discontin-
ued broadcasting for the remain- S
der of the Fall term due to equip-
ment malfunctions. “We were » 
forced to cease broadcasting be-_ 
cause our transmission problem, 
was just irreparable,” said Shaf-
fer. “The transmitters wehave, '
are not properly suited for car? '
rier current transmission.”

The stations has ordered five 5'
new carrier-current transmitters‘, _
to improve reception. Three 20-
watt transmitters will be placed 
in the Towers, another of the
same power in the Nurses Resi-I ‘
dence and a 50-watt transmitter
in the Quad. The equipment was
recommended by an engineering
consulting firm, Low Power 
Broadcast, after its representa--
tives inspected and evaluated -‘
WPGH facilities. The new trans- '
mitter will enable WPGH .to
broadcast a stronger signal with
less power at the 640 frequency».
than if it was 820. -

s Funds totaling $4.230 were re-
cently appropriated by the Stu-_: 
dent Government Allocations,
Committee for the new transmit-3
ters. The station also recently
purchased a new 'main M control‘ -,3
panel, costing $4,600, and a.$3,-— 
800 cartridge machine. Shaffeif
pointed out that most the station‘s_ ' I
equipment is over 10 years old_ I

The Knowledge Availability Sys-

i.e., the adaptation of innovative
designs and techniques to the so-
phisticated problems that con-
front industrial producers.

Drawing upon a large network
of information resources, KASC
couples the diverse capabilities
of the PDP-10 computer system

with an array of staff scientists
each holding an advanced degree
in some scientific discipline. '

Industrial research organiza-
tions or even a university students
seeking specialized information
needed for some sophisticated

their questions. After consulta-

Sen. Dono|ow’s Speech   Robin

  Urges Educ. Reform

by RALPH DEAN

Pitt's Chapter of the National
Student Leadership l<‘raternity.
Omicron“ Delta Kappa, listened to
an emotional speech written by
the late Benjamin Donalow, State
Senator. at its Founder’s Day
Banquet Monday night. Donalow
died on Monday, Nov. 27. but his
staff forwarded a copy of his
speech. which was read by chap-
ter President Dennis Concilla.

As chairman of the Senate A-
propriations Committee. Senator '
Donalow was active in questions
concerning University funding.
The text of the speech raised the
eyebrows of some of those pre-
sent with its emotional challenge
to educators to improve educa-
tional quality without asking for
increases in the large (414 mil-
lion dollars this year) Common-
wealth appropriation for higher
education.

It cited unemployment among

recent college graduates and the
poor performance of Pennsyl-
vania grade schools, as compared
to national norms, among other
reasons for questioning the large
outlay. —

The speech offered some sug-
gestions also. These included
tougher admissions policies, larg-
er student-faculty ratios. and a
reduction of "exotic” course of-
terings as possible money—savers.
Also criticized was the overlap-
ping of services of institutions
throughout the state. Donalow felt
the establishment of Penn State
branch campuses in areas demo-
graphically close to existing
school is an example of this.

Richard Tobias. English pro-
lessor here at Pitt. was asked to
respond to the content of the
speech. He stated that much of its
content was repetition of the

‘ things educators have been say-

ing for years, agreeing that the
University has too many students.
He objected to the Senators state-
ment about the relation between

spending and educational quality,

citing the mediocrity of Pitt's
English Department and the ex-
cellence of its Philosophy Depart-
ment as an example.

The difference in quality. he
explained, was due to greater
spending on the part of the latter.

canoeing, rock climbing spelunk-
ing (cave exploring), and cycling.
Trips throughout Western Penn-
sylvania and West Virginia are
planned on most weekends during
the school year.

This term expeditions include a
climb on Seneca Rocks. in West
Virginia, and a meteorite hunt
near Penn State, besides various
weekend backpacking adventures.

The group's activities were
highlighted by a week-long canoe
trip. at the close of the winter
term. This year the members
have their rights set on the scenic
North Branch of the Susquehanna
River.

Considering the extent of its
activities, Robin Hood's Merrie
Band has remained fairly anon-
ymous at Pitt. Jim. Lucot, the
president and founder of the club,
says, “Our membership has not
substantially increased over the
past two years, which is due
mainly to the fact that no one
knows about us.

I

ood’s Merrie Band

'_‘We picked up some new peo-
ple at the Fall Activities Fair,
but we would have done better if
we‘d had a better location,” Lucot
added. While the size of the club
has not changed much, the type
of people joining has.

"When the club was started. it
was basically ,a male organiza-
tion. Now, however. at least half
of oiN members are women.”

The Robin Hoods is funded by If

the Activities Fee, and is open to
any student who enjoys outdoor
recreation. The money it receives,
is used to purchase climbing gear
and camping paraphenalia.

This winter the club doesn't

plan to go into hibernation, but in- -

tends rather to take to the woods
on cross-country skis. This fast-
growing sport combines the thrill
of downhill skiing with the versa-
tility of snowshoeing. The Robin
Hoods plan to hold some of these
trips with the Pitt Ski Club, tak-
ing advantage of the combined
knowledge of both groups.

The pressure ‘which has risen in the past few weeks foi the
‘replacement of Jean Westwood as chairznan of the Democratic
National Committee should be viewed with dismay by all those
cratic Partyin the future. '
1 The move, spearheaded by the Democratic governo; s in
general and by (jovernor Dale Bumpers in particular. is con-
sidered by many to be a purge of tiie Mctjovern forces in an ef-
fort to find a scapegoat for the Novemver results. But what is
. really at stake is the fate of the Party reforiis that produced
themost open convention in iiistor .. free from the smoke-filled
_rooms of the past that gave so—called "party leaders" the noni-
ipation without even entering a single prinary as in 1968.

, "Although Mcgovern lost_ by a landslide, one must wonder if
the loss was due to the new composition ‘of the Party as these
"‘lea_ders” are now saying, as much as it was due to the failure
of these same “leaders,” many of whom sat on their hands dur-_
'-ing the campaign, to support the Democratic ticket.

,, ‘For the Democratic Party‘ to throw out its most recently
-a'cq,uired assets, the tens of thousands of enthusiastic voitin—
-‘teers and the newfound involvement of blacks and other miiior—
fities, would be an error not only from a practical political point

'tv;plurports to stand for.

It is not the time to talk aboutypurging those elements sup-
posedly responsible for the poor showing last November, but
r"ather a time for reconciliation and to build the Democratic
Party into the majority party it should be. Ms. Westwood should
beallowedj to retain her position at least until sometime next
year when cooler heads may prevail regarding the future of the

. TheDying Term

 ,Once more another Fall Term is almost completed. and the
Christmas vacation lies in the near future. In spite of the approaching
holiday season, it isn’t quite time to rejoice yet. because there is still
studying to do and final exams totake. It is, however. a good time to
rlook back over the dying term. /

Strangelyenough, the last 13 weeks now seem to have gone pretty
quickly. But back‘ on Sept. 6, Christmas was many weeks and tests and
papers away. Even when the term got started, things didn’t always go
so fast. There was at least one class that was indescribably boring. Af-
"ter the class began on the hour. you endured eons of lecturing, only to
look at your watch and discover that it was merely five minutes past.
There was not only the remaining 45 minutes_.to sit out, but also the
greater part of a term. ‘ _

Somehow, the time did fly, and so did the money. While it hurt to
,spend‘that biggest chunk of money for tuition, it was far more painful
1 spending money for books. You began to sob uncontrollably when you
had to pay five "bucks for a crummy little paperback whose subject
.fma'ttei' was’ as dry as a Saltine in the Sahara. You now also wonder
‘why you bought those books for king's ransom, only fo find out that the
;_instructor would not cover enough material to use them. Adding insult
to injury was his decision to change textbooks for the next term, so

thatnow you can’t even sell useless things for a loss.

— V Another loss for some students was the Thanksgiving weekend.
Due to a teaching schedule that was never met, a rash of papers and
testsbegan to appear right before the holiday, making the long week-
 end into four days of school work. The idea apparently" was to ‘make you
‘ thankful that you had free days on which to do the work.

j The work continued to grow after thanksgiving, in the two assign-
ment-packed weeks before Dec. 8. You wanted the time to go fast so
-"'l§;y',"va>u could be done with school for a while. but you didn't want it to go
so fast that you. failed to finish everything. It was during this ‘hectic
period that you realized your last final was on the last day" of testing,
on the last period of the afternoon. Your friends will be done testing
well before that day, and you will be half-crazy after studying for the
‘11 days leading pp to Dec. 20. ‘

‘ Hang on. though. At this point, the end will come faster than ever,
and soon you will be enjoying the beer and cheer of the Christmas sea-
son-. And just think,when Christmas is over, you‘ve got a brand-new
‘Winter Term waiting for you. Remember, this is the term consisting
‘entirely of third choice courses that you waited in line so long to get
Perhaps the term will be as good as. maybe better than, the one now
-drawing to a close. '

Letters to the Editor

Student Insensitivity

Editor. The Pitt News:

I was one of the few Pitt stu-
dents given the opportunity to be
a poll worker for the recent (Dec.
2» Model Cities commissioners
election. I spent a long but enjoy’-
able day at the David Lawrence
Hall voting site with two other
women from the Oakland com-
iiiunity. They were impressed
with the enthusiasm of the stu-
dents. both campaigners and vot-
ers. ’l‘he day would have been a
perfect example of student-com-
munity involvement and c0-oper-
ation if it hadn‘t been for the liar-

assment of two male students in .

charge of the Franklin-Pangborne

movie in David Lawrence Hall

that evening. 2

The intense resentment of these
two students toward the polling
site displayed an insensitivity to
Pitt‘s responsibility to the Oak-
land community. They created
problems, were rude, childishly
overbearing. and obnoxious..“'l‘his
building belongs to the students."
they declared. "We're here every
weekend!” Both of which are
true, and all the more reason why
the polling site should have been
left in peace. .

Misquote

Editor. The Pitt News:

It always amazes meliow well
your writers can misquote the
news that is printed. In the Dec. 1
issueof the Pitt News, there was
a picture of Fred Storaska on the
front page with a caption quoting
him as saying “for women to de-
fend themselves in the event of an
attack: ‘scream to attract atten-
tion, kick him in‘ the groin, and
carry an ‘umbrella to use as
weapon.“

During the beginning of his lec-
ture he did cite these methods as
methods women have been using,
but he also stated that screaming
works only 50 per cent of the time.
that a five-‘foot girl would almost
always miss the groin area of a
six—foot man. and an umbrella
is only worthwhile when rain is
predicted. Any of these methods
may work but Storaskas objec-
tive was to tell women techniques
that would work 100 per cent of
the time. A

He suggested that a woman
that is being assaulted should not
scream or struggle but to go along
with the assaulter until she can
employ one of the two following
methods: First, a woman often
has open access to the man’s
face. Here, she would place her
hands on his face as if she were
about to kissyhim and then turn
her hands around so her thumbs
could be placed on the assaulter’s
eyes. Then she just pushes her
thumbs ino his eyes and puts
them out. If this doe_sn’t—work she
can wait for the assaulter to ex-
pose himself and then squeeze his
testicles until he goes into shock.
These two methods work 100' per
cent of the time and was the ma-
jor advise Storaska could offer.

If the reporter had waited to
finish listening to the lecture
rather thanyquoting his first five
minutes. he or she would have
realized what the objective of the
lecture was. I

Pro-Abortionists Hit

Editor. The Pitt News:

‘ Please entertain this admitted-
ly belated response to Roger John-

.s0n’s letter (Pitt News,'Nov. 20,

1972), commenting on previous
“pro-life" proceedings (of .\ov.
9» and subsequently advancing
the “pro-abortion" position.

lruthfully, we were unaware of--

his letter until someone brought
to our attention, butwe did find it
genuinely diverting as well as
puzzling.

Certainly we do not wish to ig-

nore his little aside (“whose at--

tendance counting the four speak-
ers. .\ls. Popp. and my self came
to grant total of 19), but must
point out that sheer numbers iiei-
theij validate an argument nor
guarantee the appropriateness of
a majority's selection (Nov. 7
past may best exemplify). The
.\ov. 9 rally had been originally
intended for city-wide publicity,
with much of the media having
been contacted trough Women
Concerned. But pre— and post—elec—
tion returns had squeezed us out
of most communications‘ special
temporal slots; so. the end result
was a tiny notice in the Pitt News
(as far as we know i.

Yet,lwe must say- (as members
of an informal group.-known as
SHL or “Students for Human
Life”) that SHL is general] well
pleased that things went as well as
they did. SHL at the time of the
rally was a two-month old em-
bryo, having been really the pri-
mary force ' which had invited
PHL, Women Concerned, and
Birthright for an assemblage at
one location for a combined group
focus. We arrangedfor the facil-
ities, screen and projector on our

own to see how well we could car-

ry forth a self-appointed project,
not necessarily expecting stupen-
dous results which would have
been unrealistic to foresee. In
spite of built-in limiting factors
that come with first-‘effort thrusts,
we have gained much" self-confi-
dence that we can organize rallies
and on levels necessary, and hope

_to produce effects of greater di-

mensionality over a long-range
period, primarily in the sphere of
positive alternatives to abortion.
Nonetheless, we are not worried.

terribly over short-range effects

since its the long-range persever-
ance that counts. And we’re off to
ahumble yet pretty good start
(SHL, that is). Let what has been
stated not be taken as vain glory
for we owe a tremendous debt of
gratitude to the pro-life groups
that most graciously took the
time and trouble to help'us get on
our ‘feet. It’s because of good
friends that we’ve been able to
come as far as we have. However,
so that Mr. Johnson may be cor-
rected on the probably interpreta-
tion that‘ this was a professional
rally, we must correct him and

, say it was proposed by newcomers

to the pro-life cause. Therefore,
we at SHL feel in response, to his
remarks that it went quite well,
considering all our limitations and

the various parameters involved.

Yet if numbers were what he
wanted (for a one-time situation ),
we do say: Any such adoption of a
"might (majority: is right” cre-
do would grant physical-power.
moral force. and. "if force cre-
ates right the effect changes with
the cause (J. J. Rousseau. The Soc-
cial Contract).

Eliminating, within the span of
one paragraph, the use .of aborted
fetuses as evidence ("Such pic-
iures are very good at provoking
an emotional response that tends
to dissuade rational discussion“ ),
Roger devotes the following 45
lines to evoking parallel images
magically presented as rational-
ity's children (has there been a
mystical transformation or is this
the new-found validity product
spirited out‘ of some pro-a*bortion-
istic subectivity‘.’i. daring to
conjure. at the end of a lengthy

I paragraph. a "dying woman pe-

titioning an unsympathetic legis-
lator" vignette. l)isregarding his
image-collage "disguised as ra-
ll-Oflal discussion," we examine a
rather singular statement: "Much
less familiar to the public. now-
ever, are pictures of the results
of septic abortion that occur in
great numbers when abortion is
restricted." Surely the author in-
tended the comparative "greater"
in lieu of the absolute "great-"
all such claims made by septic
abortion to"this superlative ren-
dered insignificant by legalized
abortions “greatest.” an esti-
mated 600,000 victims so far.

‘We reply to comments concern- .

ing visual aids that they can _be
used as emotional tactics: reality
is frequently unpleasant to view-
for example, the pictures of My
Lai victims, or of ghetto children
bitten by rats. It sometimes re-
quires photos to jolt us out of our
comfortable complacency and to
make us aware of reality going on
around us. The photos are factual
andaccurate—they show ‘typical
abortion results._ They were taken

in hospitals following legal abor--~

tions. In order to make informed
decisions on an issue as imporant
as abortion, we must have a com-

-plete understanding of exactly

what abortion'involves.

Roger then addresses himself
to an historical error committed
in the third paragraph, claiming
that Hitler repealed a 1925 abor-
tion law, labelling abortions "acts
of sabotage against Germany's
racial future." Possessing not the
immediacy of resources to either
confirm or deny this assertion,
we will be quite glad to accept its
probable» validity. directing our
comments toward the underlying
emotion fostering the repeal. It
must be remembered that Hitler's

final goals oriented themselves ,,

towards an Aryan-supremacy
philosophy, which permitted the
ethical relativism to excuse Tre-
blinkas and the decimation of 6.-
000.000 Jews (which is all to tre-
quentlyforgottenii. ‘ —
It would appear that invalida-
tion of the '25 abortion law was
motivated not by» concern for an
(existing underpopulati_on prob-
lems as such but by the potential-
=ll_\ of augented_military' power
accompanying any population in-.
crease. Similarly. a demand for
liberalized abortion laws could be
fathered (or motheredi by a de-
sire of our increased power over
one's own life, a perfectly justi-
iiable wish if this power wanted
by mankind weren‘t power over
all mankind as well. In stating the
problem this way‘. we encounter
a. conflict previous adjudicated,
the expression of one man’s free-
dom (or power over selfi not per-
mitted to interfere with the life.
liberty. and pursuit of happiness
inalienably and indiscriminately
accorded’ others. So, in response
to Mr. Johnson's rhetorical ques-
tion, "Where does the ‘inalien-
able’ right to life take precedence
over the rights of the rest of us?"
and we reply. “Preci_sely at those
points where we attempt to vio-
late that inalienability of life."
We can and will cite a current
parallel. In an editorial, called “A

‘New Ethic for Medicine and So-

ciety” (California Medicine, offi-
cia journal of the California Med-
ical Association, Vol. 113, No. 3,
pp. 67-68, Sept., 1970), on p. 68 a
rather curious and highly enlight-
ening quote may be taken: “It will
become necessary and acceptable
to place relative rather than ab-
solute values on such things.
The process of eroding the old
ethic and substituting the new has
already begun. It may be seen
most clearly in changing atti-
tudes towards human abortions;

result has been the curious avoid-

ludicrous if they were not often

RM ayall Album ‘Magnificent’

4 by STEVE LUBETSKY

Moving On, John Mayall's new
.albutn. the first of six releases
in which the King of British
Blues has used the same band a
second consecutive time: is mag-
nificent. Mayall has not become
immobile. the title attests to that.

_It’s only logical that the musi-
cians who played on the previous
Mayall effort. Jazz-Blues Fusion.
’ . are reappearing for an encore in
" Moving On. For Fusion was so
_ exciting and soulful that only 45
 ;minutes of talent so noble seem-
ed not quite adequate. Moving
 ,On increases listening pleasure
\to one and a half hours. making
the turntable concert more com-
" plete. '

_ Excluding Mayall, returning are
 four of the five Fusion contribut-
ors, including Blue Mitchell on
trumpet, Larry Taylor on elec-
"_ tric bass, saxist Clifford Solomon,
“and guitarist Freddy Robinson.
. Refusing to stagnate, however,
 {Mayall supplemented the al-
gllready versatile band with addi-
Wtional personnel, including Fred
Jackson on baritone and tenor
saxes, tenorman Ernie Watts,
and Charles Owens, 'who blows
-.5 soprano and tenor saxes and
flute.
As an experiment. Mayall also
~ invited string-bassist Victor Gas-

 

 

 

’kin,".who joins forces with Larr_v.

 Tay_lor. And last but not least
 is the former drummer from
 ‘ ~.Mayall’s old Bluesbreakers, Keef
Hartley. who left his London re-
ycording sessions just" to pitch in
_‘_lj on this performance recorded at
  the Whiskey A Go Go in Los
  ._,A_ngeles last July.

_I Mayall and company waste no
V, time launching the record toa
 . dynamic start with “Worried
"33. _V Mind,” a loosely structured,

 

 

~50l_'l.

swing-like arrangement high-
lighted by jazz-oriented solos
from Charles on soprano and
Freddie Robinson, perhaps the
most brilliant guitarist Mayall
has ever played with. Further
spark to this number is provided
by Victor Gaskin’s excellent
basswork.

“Keep Our Country Green“
focuses on ecology. a topic
overexploited in much of -rock
poetry. But Mayall is one of the
few lyricists who offers a fresh

I approach with each song. without

resorting to exhausted cliches.
Mayall gets sentimental on

ballad—like "Christmas '71".

which features a flute solo by:

-Owens. while "Things Go Wrong"

is a lively piece containing ele-
ments of jazz. blues. and rock.

"Do It." which opens side
two, is much in the same style
as the tracks on side one. fea-
turing solos by Mitchell. Robin-
and Clifford Solomon on
tenor sax.

In “Moving On,” Mayall de-
picts the frustrations of trying
to keep pace with everyday liv-
ing: V ' ' ‘

,Everyone’s bringing a change

in the movies -t Better catch up,

‘cause I'm falling behind. . . . .

‘V Hours go, days go, I'm mov-'
ing on.

Reflecting this nervousness is the
appropriate instrumental accom-
paniment, including a passage
of blues riffs from Freddie Rob-
inson. ‘ A

“Red Sky" and “Reasons” are
typical Mayall 12—bar blues com-
positions, the kind which made
him so famous. And finally comes
“High Pressure Living". featur-
ing and extended tenor solo from
Ernie Watts. closing another sue“-

cessful chapter in Mayalls thick
book of accomplishments.

Unfortunately. the boundless
praise attributable to Moving On
cannot be shared by two of John
.\Iayall‘s proteges. Jon Mark and
Johnny Almond, who played in
the last group that-appeared on
two successive .\Ia_vall albums.
For the new Mark-Almond ef-
fort, Rising, is clearly a disap-
pointment.

Like Mayall, Mark-Almond
have attempted to broaden their

versatility by adding a second"

horn player, Geoff Candon, but
unlike their former colleague
their endeavor is unsuccessful.
With a reedmanas exceptional
as Johnny Almond, why clut-
ter up the beautifully dignified
sound?

And-. the album is vertually
dominated by Jon Mark. With
the exception of ‘‘I‘ll Be Leaving
You." on which Almond performs
a brief stint on tenor saxophone.
he might as well have’ sat out the
entire recording session.

For the remainder of the al-
bum he plays at best a suppor-
tive-role, deprived of the spot-
light he commands. On two of
the tracks,,“What Am I Living
For”. "and “The Phoenix,” Al-
mond doesn’t even appear.

"Riding Free”. the most dis-
tressing cut. sounds more like the
Ides’ of' March follow-up , to
"Vehicle" than it does a’Mark-Al-
mond number. i

If there is any optimism to be

found in Rising, it is the hope
that music is cyclical. and that
the next Mark-Almond album
will contain an imbalance favor-
ing Johnny Almond to atone for

’ Jon '.\Iark‘s offenses here.

The Great Waltz Slated,

for Forum Encore Opening

Andrew L. Stone's new film. The Waltz King is tentatively sche-
duled to open at the Forum and Encore theatres on December 22.
Cinematical_ly. the film may be one which will please not only the
Straussophile but the Viennaphile as well. °

Filmed in Vienna, the movie concerns the life of Johann Strauss  '

the Younger and his whirlwind existence in late nineteenth century
Vienna. From bllroom to conditorei. the flick offers. colorful shots
of Vienna’si many delights. Many of the shots were taken on the
exact location of important events in Strauss life.

Filled with what many may. rightfully consider the danceable
yet corny tunes from the master’s pens, a cast of thousands fills the
many ballrooms of Vienna's rococo places -throughout the film’s
grander moments.

In this production satiated with the flavor of the Old World.
Horst Bucholz plays the part of Strauss and Mary Costa plays his
wife. Rossano Brazzi makes an appearance as a former love of
Strauss’ -wife. _

This film may indeed prove to be the only consolation for
those of us who will be unable to make it to.\'ienna this Christmas.

l\ew Mitchell Album Fantastic .

By BARBARA GE RAUD

Sing out. all you Joni Mitch-
cll frcaks—her new album is lin-
ally out. After an 18-month
wait since Blue, For the Roses
«Asylum SD 5057» has been re-

leased to the all-too-anxious
world.
And now that I‘ve gotten it

and played it a dozen or more
times tat least). I still get that
oddly disquieting feeling I did
after playing Blue. It’s not that
this isn't a good album—it's a
fantastic one. I never cease to
marvel at Joni's images and in-
spirations. and how she weaves
them all together with that mag-
nificent voice of hers into a
musical experience that nobody
elsecould come close to dup-
licating.

It’s just that it's not quite‘as
good as Ladies of the Canyon.
I mean, that was just about the
greatest album ever released by
a female vocalist (and that in-
cludes Judy Collins and Janis
and Maggie" Bell and anyone
else -you want to name. The
songs were complete, well-put-
together, and exquisitely sung.

Even her songs of unrequited
love—“The Arrangement." "He
Comes for Conversation." "Rainy

Night House.“—they held hopes
of a brighter future. All would
be well in the end.

But with Blue——there was "All
I Want" and “Little Green" and
“This Flight Tonight"~it wasn‘t
too hard to see that Joni was a
bit ‘blue‘ ipardon the pun. it
was intentional) about things.
She wasn’t really happy any
more «eveif with "Carey" and
"MyOld Man").

And now there’s this one. Joni’s
still looking for someone, or
something, but it’s not all turn-
ing out as well as before. There
isn't that special “someone” to
thematically tie all the songs
together, like Graham Nash did
for Ladies and-‘ David Blue for
Blue.

She starts out with"‘Banquet."
an allegory on life in this time——
"Some get the gravy. and some
get the gristle, Some get the mar-
row. bone and some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare."

It‘s not the type of song that one -

would normally use to open an
album. but Joni makes it work.
Then there's her first drug
song—"Cold Blue Steel and
Sweet Fire"—a chilling ballad
about Lady Heroi'n—"concrete
concentration camp,«Bashing in

‘become -ex-head Pitt football coach Carl DePasqua. do you

think he night be willing to pass “a little of the blame for

just before packing his coaching belongingsrinto cardboard
boxes. Carl was like a newly fledged ‘bird who had been
asked to leave the-.warmtnest by a no longer desiring :noth-
er. But, Carl doesn’t want to leave Pitt like ascared _flege-
ling uncertain of the outside world. /He wants to leave in the

You have to h_ave znatured
senior to enjoy any success. Let's
just say I couldn‘t win under the
structured framework."

 

 

  

 

DePASQUA

Through spring drills, summer camp, and before the season got
underway, a Pitt News reporter decided that'DePasqua would be
one of the finer men he would meet in his lifetime. He genuine
warmth apparently didn’t soothe the hearths of a lot of people who
hd a say in his destiny._ Note after it became apparent he would
have a losing campaign—these people wanted him right from the
start. . ' _

It was evident in talking to some of the powerful people that

they .didn’t like Carl’s style. He wasn’t the charismatic. dynamite
coach on the football field and a lot of his decisions were critisized.

Win or lose though (he lost). Carl is just like the new miniature,

Q=Winchester cigars he is now smoking—something else.

Maybe someday someone will recognize him as the man who
turned Pitts program -aro. Weren’t it not for the disgusting sea-
.son the Panthers have just completed, the executive branch wouldn't
be making some of the drastic changes; designed to put Pitt back on
top (gulp). 2

“If Carl had won six games I think I would have kept him,”
announced his always solemn former boss, moments after announc-
ing the firing. ' 

And, Pitt would still be in the Big Eour—not even contemplat-
ing the hiring of a new saviour.

Strangely enough, some Pitt fans were hoping for an 0-11 sea-
son as early as the third game of the year.

“I hope we go 0-11." one was heard to say. "That way we can
get rid of Carl, theVBig Four, and hire a top name coach.“ -

Two of those steps are now complete.

Now, you must assume it was destiny all along. These unbeliev-
able things that happened to his team; the sad story of the Wish-
bone-T offense; the ten losses. ~

“Pitt is still my school. I wish the next guy all the luck.in the
world." Carl is mounting that silver stallion.

Who’s the next guy going to be anyway? Since rumorsare as
much a part of football as the lineback, here goes.

Pitt’s Casimir Myslinski had indicated that he doesn’t neces-
sarily want an assistant coach from either the pro or college ranks.
He wants a top name, a collegiate top name.

\

That would seem to eliminate Charley Phillips "(Penn State).
Chuck Klausing (West Virginia). Bart Starr supposedly called and
said he had to many business interests in Green Bay. i doubt wheth-

5‘er Pitt contacted Starr or Johnny Unitas to begin with. They have

no coaching experience and Pitt people don‘t want them to learn
here, even though they would be formidable recruiters.

.Frank Kush, Johnny Majors, Bill Battle are other often heard
names. I -

Kush reportedly as been promised the beard job of the future
Pheonix pro football team and reportedly isn't willing to pass up
that chance. Well anyway, a coach is supposedly coming to Pitts-
burgh tonight to case the joint. An announcement could come
as early as tomorrow. Don’t bet on it though.

According to one of my sources, who has a promise oflsilence,
if the coach whoycomes today refuses, the Cats -might look to the
‘AD of an Eastern School. who has shown interest in the Pitt job.

-Of course, these are all rumors. Of course.

Knighlless Cal Squad
Burns Rutgers, 99-73

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

A ho would ever believe that having the Pan-
thers‘ top hoop shooter slapped with three fouls’ in
the first minute and a half of play would turn out
to be a true blessing in disguise’? '

Despite the fact that this did happen to Pitt's
Bill "Mooney‘_‘ Knight and it subsequently. knocked
him out of action for the entire first half. the Pan-

thers buried the Rutgers Scarlet Knights alive on‘

Monday by the score of 99-73.

The Panther basketball squad showed that they -

are not a one man offense. They exhibited a bal-
anced offense. everyone was hitting throughout the
game. In the first half the Panthers burned the
Scarlet Knights with a team shooting average of
.500 and continued to step up the pressure in the
second half by hitting .684 per cent of the time.

“We just got things working in there, we got

things going when Knight got into foul trouble,” re-.

lated Pitt’s head basketball coach “Buzz” Ridl. The
younger fellows needed to find themselves—they
played confidently.” _

The player that really sparked the Pitt team af-
ter the fouls were handed to Knight was Willis Car-
dot. ’

Although Cardot was not the prime shooter for
the Panthers—he only scored a total of eight points.
seven of which came in the first half—he was the
player who ignited the squad with his sharp defen-
sive ability and his outstanding ball handling.

“Willis’ decisions were excellent,” comment-
ed Ridl on the cager who came in to take over the
number one guard position. “He’s a good player,
he’s outstanding.”

Ridl was not surprised by the peformance of
the 5-10 sophomore. “He played this way all last
year with the freshmen." explained the Pitt men-
ter. “He's a very headV_pla_ver—_he doesn‘t have too
much speed but he's got good timing.“

with 8:11.left to play in the contest, Cardot tin-
ally fouled out but hot until he had thoroughly haras-
sed the Rutgers squad.

“The game was great, that’s all I can say,”

commented Cardot after the contest. “I’m ready
for Duquesne now. The bench gave me confidence

I lcers Out To Rebound 
Against Slippery Rock . 

by BART MACK

There’s bound to be some fireworks at the Alpine
lce Chalet tonight. The Pitt Hockey Club, after suf-
fering their first defeatat the hands of a league op-
ponent on Sunday. will be entertaining Slippery
Rock College tonight and the skaters will be out to
alleviate their feelingson the Rockets.

Slippery Rock does not possess a team any
where near the caliber of Carnegie-Mellon or Pitt
but might have a reason for inspiration. Last year
Pitt mauled the Rockets in a game that saw several
lights. including a bencli-emptying brawl in the tin-
alperiod. ‘ '

Pitt found out on Sunday night against Came-
gie-Mellon that a bruising physical attack is not
enough to put the puck in the net. Several C-MU
skaters staggered up from the ice as a result of the
brutal cecking and one was removed from the
game on a stretcher, but the Tartans wound up
with the advantage in goals.

Tonight’s contest is scheduled for a 9 p.m.
starting time and buses will be provided for inter-

ested students. Buses will leave the Student Union .

from the Fifth Ave. side at 8:30 p.m.

Pitt is currently in second place in the City Di-
vision of the Western Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey
Association. trailing Carnegie-Mellon by a single
point. The icers are 4-1 while the Tartans boast a
4-0-1 slate. 'A victory over Slippery Rock would keep
the icers in good con,ten'ti_on for the divisionlead.

While the Pitt guns were hot, the Rutgers’
shooters were icy cold. The Scarlet Knights were
held to a meager .329 shooting average in the be-‘-7':
ginning of the contest. They were able to come back 
in the second half to average .656,’ but it was not’
enough to overcome the Pitt lead whichhad, reach- 
ed 48-29 by halftime. 2

energy was freshman P_hil Sellers who was top scor- '
er for his team with a total of 25 points.

Cubs Roar, 109-62

by RON SIEGEL

.\ liile tiie varsity stole all the glory on Wednes-
day night. those fans who arrived early were treat-
ed to an equally impressive game by the _]Ul'llOl" var-
sity. as the Cubs rolled over Pitt-Creensburg, 109-
oz.

The game started out close. but soon the Cubs
pulled away to stay. Greensburg opened the game
with a tough full court press, and built up a 4-0 lead
before Pitt could get untracked.

Pitt then started to press themselves. and John
Endsley put in two buckets to-tie the score. Greens-
burg matched Endsleys tallies. but Pitt followed

with eight straight points to go ahead 12-8. and 11 '

straight points soon after to go ahead 27-12.
The scrappy Cubs continued to pour it on
throughout the game and lead. 53-29 at halftime.

Picking up right where they left off. the cubs
continued. to pour it on, with Willie Kelley and Ends-
ey doing most of the scoring. _

Endsley ended up with 20 points. but the leading
scorer was 'l‘omniy Richards. who late in the first
half scored .10 consecutive Pitt points. enroute to a
23 point performance.

When a team scores 109 points, almost every-
body has high figures, and this game was no excep-
tion. A total of six hoopers netted double figures.

George McBride played a strong game and
ended up with 19 points. Keith Starr. who was dy-
namic on defense. tallied 18 points. and little Bob-

Johns Hopkins finished sixth
followed by Penn State, LaSalle,

and Villanova. Ed Cabin,

Pitt's predominantly freshman
team made its best showing ever
in this meet by scoring in all 11
events. Only four’ otiier teams
achieved that mark.

Freshman Mark Wallace broke
the Penn State pool and Pitt team
record by posting a 54.8 second
mark in the 100 yard backstroke
leg of the 400 yard medley. Mark
and his teammates John Templin,
Dave Natali. and Dave Simeone
bettered the Pitt team record by
six seconds with a time of 3:-13.5

in the medley relay.

The 400 yard backstroke relay
Dave Natali,
Winters, and Mark Wallace fin-
ished second in their event. .

Freshmen diver Jeff
and Jack Garrow turned in an
outstanding performance as they
look first place in the three .neter
diving relays and fourth place in
the one meter diving event.

Dick Bradshaw should be proud
of his swimmers as should diving
coach Al Coffey as the team did
an outstanding job.

When questioned as to the pos-
sibility of a winning season, Brad-

by Shrewsbury chipped in with 12.

Shrewsbury was hustling throughout the game.
and was constantly forcing the opposition into turn-
overs. as well as making some fantastic saves o_n
balls that seemed certain to go out of bounds.

Greensburg dressed 12 players to Pitt's sev-
en and had only two scorers in double figures, Mick-
ey Kasunic with 17 and Rich Kruzynski with 12.

Assistant varsity coach l‘im Grgurich coached

the Cubs in the first half. while Mike Paul handled
them in the second.

""l‘hey played real good the whole game." an
enthused Paul explained. "They hustled and work-
ed real hard and deserved the win.”

The team showed vast improvement over last.

Wednesday’s performance against Mount Union, al-
though the result was the same.

“They played good basketball in the second half
against Mount Union,” explained Paul. “but tonight
they played well the entire game."

The Cubs perfect record now stands at 2-0, and
they have a one month layoff until their next game.
on Jan. 3 against. Youngstown. .

They won’t have a vacation though, as they will
be working out as a team for a while and after finals
will be practicing at their former high schools.

Pitt-Greensburg will get a shot at revenge on

- Jan. 15. when they host the Pitt jayvee in Greens-

burg.

Swimmers Finish 5th Al PSU

shaw replied that “there is a good
chance for a winning season if
the team keeps on progressing,
keeps in shape, and mainly, keeps
on breaking records. Swimming
is an individual sport and the
team will only do well if its in-
dividuals can get together and
start breaking the records set by
former Pitt teams.”

\ The first home meetwill be this
Saturday at 2 p..m. in Trees Hall.

(Editor's Note: With the Steel
Bowl this weekend, the Duquesne-

'Pitt Press Association (DDPA) will

exchange basketball copy to make
it more interesting for the fans of
both schools. This story on Lionel
Billingy was written by the sports
editor of/the Duquesne Duke. Look
for another exchange in Friday's
paper.)

by TOM ROONEY

Duke Sports Editor
“And though my heart keeps tellin’ me

You're not a kid at thirty-three

You play around you lose your wife ~
You play too long you lose your life."

Softly in the background of the
basketball team’s blue—carpeted
dressing room in the Duquesne
gymnasium. Danny L)‘Keefe is
heard singing the blues of some
unseen sorrow.

Lionel Billingy. casually in-
specting a new pair of size 15 Con-
verse All-Stars, stares thought-
fully into the floor before answer-
ing the question.

~"It was in my
mind," he says
t'inally.- “If the

4 have thought about it. But it did-

n"t, so I didn‘t have to worry about
it."

_That Lionel Billingy leads the
Duquesne Dukes into what can be
expected to be an exciting and
eventful 1972-73 season is among
the most common of knowledge on.
the Duquesne campus. _That
forces have existed to suggest he
do otherwise would like, no doubt,
to be forgotten by the Duquesne

' Athletic Department. A

‘He came to the Bluff t'rom Our
Savior Luthern High School in
New York City, where he was
named the'outstanding player in
the league that school partici-
pated in.

Accompanying him were two
other prospects -‘from the New
York area, Henry Kinsey and Ed
Searcy. Before even their first

freshman basketball games, the
latter pair left Duquesne. Lionel
came perilously close to doing the
same.

“Yea, I almost left like they
did,” he admits. “And it would
have been for the same reason. It
seemed so lonely here. We came
down here together. It was a tough
decision, even tougher when they
decided to go.

"But when I thought about it.
even if I wanted to leave, there
would be all the problems of
transfering, sitting out a year.
The only other school I even seri-
ously considered before coming to
Duquesne was Wake Forest, so I
didn’t have anything specific in
mind. But I‘ve been happy here.
It just took a while to get used to
it." ‘

Bi1lingy’s ultimate decision to
stay on salvaged something of the
1970-71 frosh crew. Teaming with
local recruit Dan Slater. the
freshmen Dukes were respectable.

Last year, as a sophomore,
Lionel led all Duquesne scorers
with .542 points and a 21.6 per
game average. And although the
Dukes finished with an impres-
sive 2045 mark for the year, tour-
nament invitation were not forth-
coming.

Lionel still retains some,bitter-
ness that the Dukes went unin-
vited. "A lot of teams, especially
in the NIT, couldn't compare with
what we did." he says. "It just
means that this year we have all
the more to prove. -

"But as far as this season goes,_

I‘m just looking for us‘ to have a
good year with a tournament at
the end. No frills. no lace, just a
good season."

Billingyisums up his personal
ambitions for the coming year in
one hyphenated word. “All-Amer-
ican,” he says. “I’d like to do well
enough .to receive All-American
consideration.” He writes off the
fact that he wasn’t much consi-
dered for either the Olympics or
as an All-American last year.

"Because I was a sophomore,
not too much was expected and I
didn’t get too much publicity."
he says. “After all we were rank-

ed 85th in the preseason polls so
no one was looking too much to-
ward Duquesne to have any kind
of a season."

Though the 1971-72 season was
highlighted by much success for
Billingy—he would win the steel
Bowl MVP as well as lead the
Dukes in most departments —
"The Train" got his most person-
al satisfaction in what would be a
losing cause.

The Dukes were playing at
Maryland just after pushing their
way into the national rankings.
With a few minutes to go in the
game and Maryland slightly ahead,
Lionel walked off the floor toward

the dressing room with an ankle .

injury.

The partisan Maryland crowd
of more than 14,000 rose to their
feet in tribute to Lionel. who had
played an exceptionally strong
game. The Dukes would lose and
although he took the loss bitterly,
Billingy admits some satisfaction
from the gread crowed reaction.

"I was feeling bad because we
were on our way to a defeat and
I was injured,” he says. "And
suddenly on the way _to the dress-
ing room, I heard the crowd. I
didn’t know what to think at first.
After all, I didn’t expect it on the
visitor's court. But it really freak-
ed me out. I never felt so proud
to be playing basketball as I did
then."

After the Dukes entertained
Stubenville at the Civic Arena

Monday-a game that must be as- I

sumed a victory—the Steel Bowl
will be of prime concern. Billingy,
although cognizant of the intense
rivalry between the Dukes and
first round opponent Pitt, holds
no particular grievance against
the cross-city opponent.

-"When I originally camehere,
one of the first things that I no-
ticed was the antagonism between
the two schools." says Lionel.

"While I really can’t relate to‘

that, I feel the excitement. Most
of the Pitt players I know and call
friends. They’re for me and .I‘m
for them anytime except the day
we‘re on /the same _~baseketball
court." , ' ’
