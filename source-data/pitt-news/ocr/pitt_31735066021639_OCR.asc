CGS, senate committee call forMarous’ resignation

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

The College of General Studies
student government and the
university senate budget—policies
committee have called for the
resignation of Board of Trustees
Chairperson John Marous. _

The action “stems from Mr.
Marous’ lack of responsibility
demonstrated as chairman of the
Board of Trustees regarding past
Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
retirement and compensation
package,” according to a
statement released by CGS.

Republican group J
condemns coverage
of BiGALA incident

Byjenna Ferrara .
News Editor

In a “private caucus” closed to the press yesterday,
the College Republicans voted to condemn a recent
Pitt News article detailing an alleged harassment of
six gay Pitt students by CR Vice President Kevin

Docherty.

The CRs are unsure about their future actions
against the newspaper, but they “plan to talk to
administrators about the incident,’.’ CR public
relations director Jonathan Kurland said.

Six members of Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance alleged last week that Docherty had
shouted, “Die fags” at them outside the William Pitt
Union on Sept. 16. The article, “BiGALA members
allege harassment” was printed Sept. 26.

The CR5 criticized The Pitt News for printing an
account of the alleged incident withoutlpermission
from the affirmative‘ action ofﬁce. “A fair investigation
by the local Affirmative Action Office will reveal the
truth and prove the allegations false and intentionally
misleading,” according to. the statement. ,

The affirmative-action office has not yet resolved
the complaint, and “we feel the article in The Pitt
News acted as if it was,” Kurland said. The paper
“should have waited until all the facts had been
known.  The actual incident is one person’s
words against another. It's not enough to determine

guilt or innocence.”

“lAfﬁrmative action] had asked that this not be
printed and it was printed,” CR President Jacinta

Dvorak said.

CR memberJody Hoberek said the article “didn’t
follow proper procedures  besides the fact that it’s

One of the few things that Pitt
Professor Barbara Burstin enjoys
more than a good game of tennis
is the pursuit of learning.

“I'm committed to education.
It's what I do,” she said.

To show that commitment,
Burstin, a history professor at
Pitt, is running for the Pittsburgh
Board of Education. While she is
determined to help the public
school system, she says she is

that Marous knew about Posvar’s
controversial retirement package,
even though he denied full
knowledge when the package
became public last summer.

“We feel very strongly that
enough is enough,” CGS council
President Marcie Roberts said.
“Now to find that Marous might
have known is just another slap
in the face. How many times do
we get hit before we don’t get up
again?” Roberts said.

Roberts said Marous’
negligence is “blatantly clear."

If Marous did know about
Posvar’s retirement package, then
“he was deceptive,” Roberts said.

-summer.

If he did not know, then “he
wasn’t doing his job,” she said.
Roberts said the council is
currently looking into the actions
of other trustees. _ .
“We don’t want to be hasty,”
Roberts said. “We are trying to
find out whether they acted on
behalf of the university or whether
other interests were at play.”

, Roberts said students are still
reeling from the events of last
CGS students are
especially affected by the
apparent misuse of funds, Roberts
said. ,

‘‘CGS students are paying for
their own education,” Roberts

said. “CGS students may say to
themselves ‘It is not worth it here
at Pitt. I can no longer justify this
expense.”

The CGS council and the BPC
will present their statements
regarding Marous to the Faculty
Assembly today.

The BPC unanimously voted
to call for Marous’ resignation on
Friday. The BPC’s position differs
from CGS’ position in that CGS is
calling for Marous to resign as
chairperson and as a trustee while
BPC is only calling for his
resignation as chairperson.

The BPC action does not focus

. go about it.

“I’m not a politician. I’m an
educator, and I’m in this for the
beneﬁt of education,” she said.

“What I want to do is take
politics out of the school board,
but to get there I’m immersed in
a political process —- it’s a
contradiction.” ‘

But it is a process that she is
willing to go through. She said
she is running for the school
board not only because she is
committed to education but

because she wants to pay back
the public schools for all they
have given her children.
Burstin was born in
Farmingdale, N .Y. In high school-
she was very active in the Girls’
Leaders Club, and she played the
clarinet and saxophone in the
Daler Dance Band. She was also

She graduated in 1962 from
Vassar College with an
undergraduate degree in
economics and a minor in history.

She received her master’s in

University. She was married that
same year.

She then began teaching high —

In 1966 Burstin quit teaching to
be a full-time mother for her four
children.

In 1973 she moved to Pittsburgh,

By Ross Pasquale
The Pitt News

Robert E. Dunkelman,
executive assistant provost
for budget and finance, and
Jeffrey A. Romoff, senior
vice president of health
sciences, have been jointly

’ appointed to the position

of interim senior vice
president of budget and
finance while a search is
being conducted for the
permanent senior vice
president, Pitt President J.
Dennis O’Connor
announced in a letter to the
university community.

“The two areas that will
report to Jeff and me are
the vice president of
administration, who isJohn
Yeager, andthe vice
president of finance,
Edward Hunia,” said
Dunkelman, who is also
the chair of the search
committee for the senior
vice president.

The search committee
met for the second time
yesterday to discuss the
selection process.

The committee has
placed advertisements in
the New Yorle Times and the
Wall Street Jourrzai and ads
will soon appear in the
Chronicle of Higher
Education and Blacle
Issues ofHigberEducation.

The committee has
received about seven
resumes to be reviewed
and expects to look at
approximately 200 before
the search is over.
O’Connor has said he wants
to see three or four finalists
by January, and he will
choose the senior vice
president from among
them.

Unlike the presidential-
search committee, there is
no student representative
on the senior vice president
search committee. But
students will be meeting
and questioning the finalists

in January, according to

Dunkelman.

The new senior-— vice
president will have many
of the same duties as the
former executive vice

president,Jack B. Freeman, ’

who vacated that position
last November to work at
Temple University.

Civil liberties most crucial48 hours after arrest

M k Smith
gzjf Wat‘Ii.ter

Two weeks ago, Know Your

I Rights discussed an individual’s

rights before an arrest. Of course
‘after an arrest, the story gets
more interesting. A lot can happen
to you.

A lot is changing in relation to
your rights after an arrest and
your right to receive a fair trial.
The Supreme Court has been
reworking civil liberties in relation
to criminal suspects. (As an
important aside, one should
remember one is a criminal
suspect if accused of a crime.
People are assumed innocent until
proven guilty.)

Another area of interest with
crime and civil liberties is the
Miranda decision. Television
popularized thefamous Miranda’
warnings, but in most cases
constitutional technicalities are

“not responsible for letting

criminals go free.

Question: What is the prudent
thing to do if I am arrested?
Answer: You should remain

calm. Resisting arrest, fighting
the police or running away will
only make the situation worse.
The validity of an arrest or charges
will be settled in the future, not
between you and a police officer
directly after you are arrested.
Even if you were not guilty of a
wrongdoing, but if you resist
arrest, your only charge could be

*' resisting arrest.

Q: What happens ‘after an
arrest? '
A: Usually the police will bring
you to the station and book you.
This can include fingerprinting,
photographing or participating
in a lineup. .

Q: What rights are important I

after an arrest?
A: These rights are known as
your Miranda rights, stemming
from the court case of the same
name. In 1966 the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in the case Miranda
vs. Arizona that you have the
rightto remain silent. Anything
you say can be used against you
in a court of law. You have a right
to an attorney, and if you cannot
afford an attorney, a court will
appoint one for you.

Some people falsely assume if
the police do not read a criminal
suspect their Miranda rights, "a

suspect will go free; This is not _

the case. Miranda only applies if
the police try to question you. If
the police do not interrogatea
suspect, reading the Miranda

warning is not a matter of great

consequence.

Also, no lawyer has to be
appointed until a suspect is
brought to court. Of course, if the
police attempt to question a
suspect after a request for an

attorney, the police cannot

interrogate until _the lawyer is
present.

After arrest, there is a right to
make a phone call. The police
should provide assistance if
necessary. _

Finally, after arrest, a suspect
must be taken before a judge
within a 48-hour period. This
used to be a 24-hour period, but
this year the U.S. Supreme Court
changed the rule to 48 hours.

Q:Whatexactlyhappenswhen
I face the judge at a hearing?
A: The hearing before the judge
after an arrest is called an
arraignment.

The judge or magistrate will
announce the charges against you,
discuss‘ bail, and in most non-
serious cases you will be released

/on ball or on a promise to return
to the court.

Impact works to increase minoritiesin engineering

By Dan Darragh
For The Pitt News

“This place is big, man! When I first got
here, I didn't know what to do. It was my
first time away from home, and I was just
starting to realize there’s a huge difference
between high school and college. But
Impact helped a lot.”

Pitt sophomore Aleta Howard is talking

about the Pitt Engineering Impact Program. '

‘‘Impact really got me off to a good start.
I got oriented to the campus and saw what
it has to offer. Impact’s summer program
showed me how to plan my work schedule,
how to adjust to dorm life and being away
from home. I brushed up on my math and
science skills. This was good because
engineering can be tough!”

Since 1971, Impact has been working to
increase the number of minority students
in the School of Engineering. Impact offers
recruiting, counseling, tutoring and
financial-aid services, as well as a special
summer program for entering students.

Dr. Karl H. Lewis, associate professor of
civil engineering, is Impact’s founder and
director. He said he would like to see the
number of minority students increase to
10 percent of the engineering
undergraduate student body by 1995. The
current rate is 7 percent.

Lewis said there are few minorities in
engineering because “many minority
students lack role models. They don’t see
many engineers, so they don’t think of
themselves as engineers."

economic hardships which prevent parents
from giving “adequate advice regarding
their children's school work and choice of
careers. Not enough black parents have

3 experienced the academic achievement
that would motivate their children to excel
in school. It’s like a circular thing,” Lewis
said.

The Impact program hopes to break that
circle. It offers a six—week summer program
for students who are not eligible for
admission to the School of Engineering.
Successfully completing the summer
program can lead to admission.

“Some of the students we recruit don't
meet all the criteria for admission, which
is rather stringent. This criteria includes an
SAT score of 1,100 and graduation in the
top 10 percent of the class or an A—7B+

Burstin was recently appointed
to the Pittsburgh Human Relations
Commission by Mayor Masloff.
She had also been appointed by
superintendent Richard Wallace
to the Citizens’ Committee for
Excellence in the Public Schools.

She has worked to try to make
people aware of the quality of
the public schools in the area

and to attract people to the city-

and its school system.

“I wear a lot of different hats,”
she said. “One of the great things
about Pittsburgh is that you can
do that.”

In 1980 Burstin came to Pitt for
the doctoral program in history.
She was a teaching fellow and
received her.degree in 1986. After
that she was hired as a part-time
instructor by Pitt.

She has taught various history
courses here, including U.S. and
the Holocaust, Jews in the U.S.,
Pride and Prejudice in American
History and Blacks and Jews. In
the spring she will also be
teaching a course at Duquesne
University.

She has_ received the “Apple

given to teachers by the College
of General Studies based on the
votes of students.

If she wins the seat on the.

continue teaching at Pitt. As one
,of nine board members, she said
she would like to maintain a_nd
build on the program of
excellence in the public schools.
She said she also wants to improve
the inter—grou p relations with the

students.

Burstin said she wants more
involvement of Pitt students with
students from the public— school
system, in both an academic and
a social support— group network.

Burstin wants help from Pitt
students with this election, but
her primary concern is that all Pitt
students register to vote. She is
also asking for help from any
students who would like to work

. for her campaign.

She acknowledges that being
on the school board can be "a

‘ thankless task, but she said she is

still committed to doing it.

“The city of Pittsburgh has
a very good public— school
system,” she said. “Can itbe better?
Yes.”

For The Pitt News ‘

The opening of the new 600-
student dormitory next August
will force the university to make
some changes to accommodate
the large number of students
that will live there. i

The quickest route to the new
dorm, located behind Pitt
Stadium, is through the Learning
Research and Development
Center building, located on
O'Hara Street across from
Benedum Hall.

LRDC’s elevator saves students
from having to walk around Pitt
Stadium or down University
Drive past the Chevron Science
Center. '

I Jack Aug, director‘ of‘

administrative research and
development services at LRDC,
said that the 600 additional
students could be a. “major
problem.” "

“It’s not only the problems
with the legitimate students
coming through. Once you start

» to get a crowd, you get other

people filtering through. We've
had a lot of thefts recently,” Aug
said.

“We know we’re going to have
to do something. We're not
sure exactly what it’s going to
be.”

William Harmon, vice
president for student affairs, said
security in the new dorm area
will be enhanced by the
installation of a lighting system
around the new dorm and

increased police patrols in the
area.

Other problems include
students cutting through LRDC
and monopolizin g the elevators,
making it difficult for employees
to use them, Aug said.

Aug _said he wants the
University of Pittsburgh to find
a. solution to the possible
problems before the dorm
opens.

“One solution is possibly
blocking off the back of the
building and not have it be an
access,” Aug said.

Harmon added ‘that the
campus bus and shuttle vans
will be making “more frequent
appearances in front of the new
residence hall.”

Another possible solution is

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October 1, 1991

New dorm could cause ‘major problem’ for LRDC

the construction of an escalator
system next to LRDC that would
transport students up and
down the hill without
having to actually enter the
building.

The escalator system was
proposed with the construction
of the LRDC building in 1974
but was not built.

The space for the escalator
system still exists on the side of
LRDC.

There have been no definite
decisions made by Pitt, but Aug
hopes that the escalator system
will be considered.

“We want to be as cooperative
as possible, but it can be a
real problem if [LRDC] is the
only access to the dorm,” Aug
said. u

on the issue of Marous’ memory,
according to Maureen McClure,
BPC co-chairperson. The lack of
consultation on Posvar’s
retirement package within the
trustees and with the faculty was
a key issue with the BPC.
“There was a lack of
consultation within the board,”
McClure said. “There was
absolutely no consultation with
the faculty. There was a complete
breach of trust.” _
McClure said ,the action is
“something that has been building
up for a long time.”
According to SGB President Brent
Saunders, the SGB will consider
whether to follow the CGS . 
action at a meeting today.

Impact

provides counseling and tutoring
services during a student's four
years in college. “We won't just
admit you and cut you /loose. We
want to retain as many students
as possible,” Lewis said.

Some entering students do meet
all the requirements for
admission, but they choose to go
through the summer program
anyway. Sophomore Chris Capers
said, “It wasn’t mandatory, but I 
was told Impact has a good
counseling program, and I
thought that might be helpful 
It doesn’t feel good to know that
the retention rate of minorities
[in engineering] isn’t very high. If
you don’t do well, then you start
to accept it instead of trying to do
better. But everybody’s an
individual. Just because the
numbers show your race isn’t
doing well doesn’t mean you 
have to do the same.” ’

Impact focuses on blacks and
Hispanics since larger
percentages of those groups fall
into the category of
“disadvantaged students,” but
Lewis emphasized that Impact
makes its services available to all
students who need it, regardless
of race.

Thirty to 50 students are
enrolled in this program each
year, and, on the average, 25 to .¢
40 of these are admitted into the
School of Engineering.

totally untrue.”

The group held ‘a private
meeting because “we felt since 
the incident was supposed to be
private  we’d have our voting in
private,” according‘ to ‘Kurland.
He said he could not remember
the last time the CRs held a
meeting closed to the press.

The purpose of the article was
to “lambast the CRS,” Kurland
said.

It was “kind of dirty” to print
Docherty’s College Republican
affiliation in the article, said CR
honorary board member and
former Students For Life President
Joel Garrett. Kurland said the C011-
ege Republicans should not have
been mentioned in the article.

Although Dvorak said the
College Republicans are not
connected with the alleged
incident, they have released the
statement against the article

because “our name has been
dragged down,” she said.

The Pitt News also acted
unfairly because a Pitt News
reporter was among the men
making the allegations against
Docherty, Kurland said. \

“We find/it unethical that [the
article was published] and Mark
Smith writes for TbePittNews.” she
said. Smith had ﬁled the complaint
with the affirmative action office,
and three other BiGALA members
were quoted in the article as well.

The College Republicans also
questioned the length of the
article, which measured 54
column inches..

“That’s the longest article I’ve
personally ever seen in The Pitt
News. They printed it to further
their agenda,” "Garrett said.

The article “was an issue, of
certain people attempting to force
their own‘ political agenda on
others. We do not, as a group nor

F UN WITH GRANDMA

as citizens, condone this type of
behavior, nor can we accept it,”
according to the statement.

“There are a lot of editorial
writers in The Pitt News,
however, not all of them write in
the perspective section,” Kurland
said, listing the article condemned
by the'CRs as an example. “I find
it odd that the management of
T79ePittNewsis pushing their own
political agenda of liberalism on
the campus . . rather than
providing unbiased reporting.”

“This [political correctness]
thing has gone too far,” Dvorak
said.

The meeting was also attended
by Pennsylvania CR treasurer
David Jason. “We’re 100 percent
behind [Pitt's] CR3. We don’t
understand why - other groups
have a problem with the things
[the CR5] do. We want to put this
whole matter to rest as quickly as
we can.”

The College Republicans stand
for “voter registration, political
awareness and working for

according to Jason.

“We’re just getting bashed back

just want to coexist and work.” '

The last point of the CRS’ state-
ment reads, “We recognize the

Dvorak said “sexual

oversight. Gays, lesbians and

Fond memories of the rush experience

I am writing to all rushees as a
concerned senior who, at this
time four years ago, went on the
same seeminglystressful, mental
roller-coaster ride upon which
you have recently embarked. Like
you, I was uncomfortable in this
new environment. I was shy,
alone, unsure of myself and scared
as hell of college and what it
would bring.

After the first three days of
eating alone in the cafeteria and
sitting on the union lawn, envy-
ing the groups of people around
me laughing and discussing up-
coming weekend plans, I decided
to get off my butt and do some-
thing. That’s when I signed up for
sorority rush. Many of you may
relateto what I am saying, and
some may not, but whatever the
case, I’d like to share one of my
experiences with you.

It was 10 a.m. on a Saturday,
and I, along with 300 other anx-

A ious rushees, met in the Ballroom
of the William Pitt Union. We
were divided into groups alpha-
betically. The 14 other “G5” and
myself sat around two tables that

had been pushed together to make 1

one. .

A girl with a ﬂuorescent yellow
clipboard in her hand stood at the
end of the long table. She dis-
cussed the rush events in detail. It
reminded me of/anArmy ofﬁcer

brieﬁxis tr<><>r>s.o.r.1It1n=# ,ur>c9mins,-

battles (but of c’ou'rse we were
dressed nicer). Her rank was Rho
Chi, and her duties entailed

Catherine
Goldstein

guiding us through the jungles of
rush and answering any questions
we had.

Together we marched on to the
dorm that was strategically placed
in the middle of the Quad and
housed 10 of the 12 sororities.
Amos Hall was an old building,

and asI climbed the endless ﬂights ~

of stairs, I decided it must have
been built before central air was
invented When we ﬁnally reached
our designated ﬂoor, I could feel
beads of sweat running down the
sides of my face along my hairline.
I was panting so heavily, I felt
somewhat faint
We had a couple of minutes
before the first rush party started,
so I tried to pull myself together.
With the sleeve of my shirt I
wiped the sweat off my upper lip
and from underneath my eyes. To
my dismay, there was smeared
eyeliner and blush on my new
white T -shirt. But before I could

worry about it, the big wooden ,

door swung open, and a tall girl
with long, wavy hair came out
and smiled.

“Hi, welcome to Zeta Zeta Zeta,”

 she ,sa_id,._ Wewalked in single ﬁle
.,Ih¥9l18h,a.¥l?!IT9W hallway Where

girls on either side were clapping
and singing. I couldn’t tell what
they were singing exactly, but

they looked so happy to see us.
As we reached them, each rushee
was met by two sorority girls, one
from each line, and the three
walked into a larger room. The
walls were painted white, and
above one of the four sofas hung
a huge, framed composite with
individual pictures of each sister.

The room was adorned with
trophies, plants, memorabilia that
distinguished Zeta Zeta Zeta from
any other house. The air was
Filled with sweet ﬂoral scents of
potpourri, which would be soiled
later with the overpowering blend
of perspiration, hair spray and a
variety of stale perfumes. We

found a seat by one of the win»-

dows and began talking.

At first I was really nervous
because I didn’t know what to
expect, but the girls were friendly,
and after a few minutes the knots
in my stomach began to loosen.
They told me about the different

activitiestheir house was involved ‘

in andpointed to trophies they

had won in Greek Week, which -
were proudly displayed on a _

mantel abovea fake ﬁreplace.

Despite the occasional breeze I

and the few fans scattered around
the room, it was warmer in there
than ‘outside in the late August
morning. We had been there for
10 minutes, and already I felt the
backs of my thighs sticking to the

1 ‘leather couchl was sitting on. I
could only pray thatwhen I finally I

stood up, there wouldn’tbe traces
of my sweaty legs. As if she knew

what I was thinking, one of the
girls changed the subject from
philanthropies to the weather.

After 20 minutes and a skit
telling us why we should be Ze-
tas, the tall girl who had met us
when we came in smiled warmly,
politely thanked us for coming
and wished us the best of luck
with the rest of rush. We said our
goodbyes and walked back
through the narrow hallway of
singing girls until we reached the
familiar stairwell.

The rest of the day was much of
the same: singing, enthusiastic
girls, conversations consisting of
the weather, Greek Week and
mixers and cute, ﬁve—minute skits.
As rush progressed, the parties
got longer, people became more
familiar, and I was now a whiz at
running up and down the steps of
Amos.

Although many rushees
dropped out during the process, I
stuck it out to the very end -—-the
ﬁnal preference parties. I ﬁnally
signed a bid. Today I am a happy,
well-adjusted student who no
longer eats lunch by herself while

envying other groups of people.

For me, a sorority was a great
place to meet people and ﬁnd my
niche in college, so if you have I
just gone through rush, con-
gratulationsl And don’t forget to
have fun! .

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBIR

 

Night classes can be hazardous to your work

 

Here’s the scene: It's the day

before you’re meeting with your
advisor to schedule for spring term.
You’re frantically searching for just
the right classes, ones that won’t
force you to wake up too early,
ones that give you a few hours
between classes to sleep and of
course, the most important quality
when searching for courses, no
class on Fridays!

So there you are, huddled over a

schedule of classes and course
description guide. Twelve credits

already selected, but you need just
three more. The only day classes
that fit your oh-so— easy schedule
are behavioral neuroscience and
American history. Negative on that.
Too much reading, too much work.
But what’s this? College of General
Studies offers night classes? Saved
once again!

But are you? The night-class bug
can be deadly.

Way back in first grade we were
taught by our parents to do our
homework right after school. Sure,

as we grew up, we altered the
pattern a little bit. After all,
homerooms in high school were
always ﬁlled with students franti-
cally completing the homework
they ignored the night before, but
it is still a natural instinct to do
homework in the afternoon or in
the evening. Thus, the night-class
trauma begins.

‘You set your schedule so that
you have two night classes: Mon-
day at 5:45, Wednesday at 8:20.
Now your average student (with
no night classes) will wake up
every morning at 9 or 10, go to
classes, do the typical Pitt- student
things and go to bed around one or
two every night.

And you? Well, if you’re a night
owl like me, you can’t go to bed
just two or three hours after you get
out of a class. So you stay up until
three or four. Hell, you may even
stay awake to see the sun rise over
Pittsburgh. Finally, you slumber at
6 a.m. For an average night’s sleep,
you must wake up at 1 p.m. Sounds
like a relaxing life, right?

Wrong.

Last semester, my earliest classes
began at 1 p.m. I did the hour and
15 minute class thing for one class,
and I also had twonight classes.
Big mistake. ’

When I registered for those night
classes, I lied (and swore) to myself
and said I’d wake up early every
day and do my work. Yeah, right

Chrissy Cortazzo

There’s something that I’ve noticed about the
students at Pitt: It seems that many of you aren’t from
the Pittsburgh area. I've lived in the‘ suburbs of
Pittsburgh all my life, and I've realized that most of
you don’t know about some of the history that helped
to build the city we live in today.

Well, Pittsburgh really is a happening town, and I’ve
found a few interesting facts that you probably don’t
know about. , _

For example, did you know that there was an
amusement park right here in Oakland? Actually it’s
not surprising considering how many of us act like
we’re at an amusement park 24 hours a day. But
seriously, Luna Park occupied the land between Grant
St. and Bigelow Blvd. The park, which started
operating in 1905, closed four years later when a fire
destroyed most of the property.

The main attraction at the Luna was the “Infant

Incubators. ” This attraction served as a sort of scientific .

sideshow, where modern medical techniques on
premature-infant care was demonstrated. Patrons of
the park got to see these “preemies” grow to health
right before their eyes. Pretty interesting, huh?

It’s actually kind of ironic that this was an amuse-
ment park sideshow when we now have Sara Kelton
right here in Oakland. Sara is the world’s youngest
heart-transplant recipient; She was in her mother’s
womb for only 35 weeks, prior to an operation at
Children's Hospital. _ ‘

Another example of Pittsburgh history is the famous
Forbes Field. This “Old Lady of Schenley Park” was
built in the spring of 1909 in an incredible 4 months.
Many of you may already know that this ﬁeld was

. home to the Pirates, but did you know that the Steelers

played there too? Forbes Field was also home to’

, community place. Every street surrounding the field

had many restaurants and bars where you couldgo to ,
eat, drink and be merry. Then all you had to do was

, simply cross the street to attend the game. Kids could

actually speak to their favorite ball players without
being verbally attacked or shut down for an autograph.

The players loved their fans and Pittsburgh, and they

‘showed this by signing. autographs and talking with
the people who attended the game." V
Forbes Field had its proud moments and great

_ baseball games. Thelmost famous game ever held at

Forbes Field was during the 1960 World Series, when
Bill Mazeroski hit a home run and the,Pirates won the
World Series. S v " '
Sadly, onJune 28, 1970, the Pirates played their ﬁnal
gamesat Forbes Field — a double—header. Soon after
this, the park was torn down, and construction went
under way for a new building. Forbes Quad currently
stands-inits place. . ‘ .
On the first ﬂoor of Forbes Quad, in the area by the
CIS computing lab and Rm. IKS6, is the old home

A plate from Forbes Field. For those of you who dream

of playing professional baseball, this is your chance to

“get a feel for batting in the big leagues. Just think,

you’re up to bat and standing in the same place where
greats like Bill Mazeroski and Roberto Clemente
stood. SHHHHH! If you listen carefully, you can still
hear_.the roar of the crowd and the sound of a wooden
bat cracking at the hit of a baseball.-

If you walk up from the Mervis Business School and .
look at the brick and ivy-covered wall, you can read
the numbers that once represented the wall at Forbes
Field. This is one of the only original remnants still
standing of this great piece of history.

See, Pittsburgh really is an exciting place! There’s a
lot about it that many don’t know. I hope to bring you
more interesting facts about this city, so keep on the
look-out for  things that aren’t there anymore!

Soccer drops Big East match to Huskies

-Byjason Billings

Staﬁ’ Writer

Thirty-five hundred cheering
Connecticut fans watched their
No. 1 ranked Huskies clobber
the Pitt Panther soccer team 4-0
on Sunday. That televised game

. showed a mentally unfocused

Pitt team that didn't seem to do
anything right.

“We made all kinds of
mistakes,” said Panther head

Acoachjoe Luxbacher. “We were

giving up goals and making

' dumb mistakes.”

It seemed that the whole

Vroadtrip was plagued by
' mistakes and distractions.

The team was awakened from
their sleep about 3 a.m. the
night before the game. A fire

alarm, thought to be set off by

their building's heating system,
‘caused that distraction.
.: Maybe that had something to
do with the game 
“No, you can‘t blame the ﬁre
alarm," said Pitt assistant coach
Heinz Pak. ‘
“lConnecticut] was bigger and
stronger than us. We weren’t
getting the ball wide at all,” he

* said.

“In the first half, we played
pretty good. But at the 12-minute
mark everything broke down,”
Pak said. “They scored and then
scored again six minutes later.”

The Panthers will be looking
for a “big win" on Wednesday
against a seasoned division one
team, Marshall University, here
at home.

Marshall, described as a strong
team by Luxbacher, may see
their strength as the Panthers’
own weaknesses.

"Our defense lacked
discipline,” Pak said. "In the
second half, we didn't use the
midfield effectively,”

Attltebeginningoftlieseasron,
the Panther's defense seemed
sluggish and didn’t respond as
quickly to offensive attacks as a
division one team should have.
Entering the game with a record
of 4-1-1, that problem was

. thought to have been corrected,

But that same problem crept
up on the unfocused Panthers

in Connecticut and handed them
their second loss on a silver
platter.

Strangely enough, the Panthers
outshot the Huskies 10 to 6 in the
first half, but they couldn’t
capitalize on what they did do
right.

: “It was a bad loss,” Pak said.
After the game up north, the
Panthers return to their home
turf with something to prove.
‘‘We’ll' be ready; we better
be,” Luxbacher said.
“What we need to do is play
90 minutes of soccer instead of

only 70 or 80,” Luxbacher said.
“[Connecticutl played hard at
home,” he said. Now it’s the
other team’s turn.

“If you’re making a lot of
decisions, you have to be

mentally prepared,” he said.

Wandering Pak returns to Pitt as assistant

ByJasonBillings
Slaﬁ'Wrl¢er
Heinz Pak, free-agent

professional soccer player and

. assistant coach for the Pitt soccer

team, bounces a tennis ball
around campus to relieve a little
stress.

But the 24-year-old also carries
around 14 years of soccer
experience, which has bounced
him around the east coast and
Europe. He even spent four
years with Pittsburgh's
unrevived soccer team, the Spirit.

But not so long ago, Pak left

Pittsburgh to play for a New York
professional indoor soccer team,
the Albany Kick, of the National
Pro Soccer League. He began his
professional career in February
1991, but it ended quickly a month
later.

Pak was released out of his
contract at the end of March
1991, after the Kick was forced to
release him and seven other
players.

He said he would return
someday to the world of
professional soccer “if the chance
came along” and he got a good
deal.

“It was weird, but it was
great,” Pak said

“People don’t realize what it
is like for professional athletes,”
Pak said. Team members would
practice twice a day until 3 p.m.
and then have the rest of the
day off. “It was just like college,”
Pak. said.

Pak played at midfield and
defensive positions during his
five and one-half week tenure
with the Kick, scoring four goals
and one assist. “During halftime
some of the kids would come
out of the stands and ask for
autographs. It was really wild,"

he said.

But for now Pak said he
would like to continue
coaching at Pitt for another
three or four years. “As an
assistant coach, I try to be a
mediator between the coach
and the players. I know how
frustrating it is to be a player
under Coach Luxbacher,” he
said. “[Luxbacher] pushes the
guys and is very disciplined,
which is good,” Pak said.

Pak has his own
responsibilities, though. Even
when he is showing the

Harriers
split with
Bucknell

By Keith Dowling
For The Pitt News

With cool weather, smooth
downhills and record breaking
times, it turns out there was more
than one “Great” race this past
weekend.

Instead of a winding course
through the streets of Pittsburgh,
Bucknell hosted its annual dual
meet with the Panther cross-
country teams on the fast greens
of their local golf course.

Mike Formica led the Panthers
with his first collegiate cross-
country win, running the eight-
kilometercourse in 24:18. Jason
Bodnar followed a few ticks
behind in 24:23.

But despite the Panthers’
strength up front, the remaining
pack. of Pitt harriers came up
short against the Bisons of

V Bucknell, 26-33.

“They had a nasty pack,”
Formica said. “We just keep
running into the best teams in

our region early. We still have 1

seven weeks to learn from our
mistakes. I’m not giving up on
anybody yet.” .

Another factor that may be
slowing down the Panthers is the
loss of T om Swartout two weeks
ago. Hampered by nagging calf
problems since last year, Swartout
is expected to return within the
next two weeks.

V Swartout’s Top 30 performance
at last year’s Big East
Championships proves he will
be a welcomed addition.

Behind Bodnar’s runner-up
position was Steve Forrester’s
seventh—place finish. His time of
25:13 were his second personal
record in a row this season.

Rounding out the rest of the
Panther pack was Mike Lynn’s
13th placing in 25:42, «Craig
Woshner’s 14th place (25:45), Pete
Beehler’s 16th place (25:49) and
Brian McCollough’s 18th place
ﬁnish (25:57). Also paying their
dues for Pitt were Frank Nesko
(26:25), Jamie Hibell (27:01),
Devon Bradley (27:05) and Tim
Arndt (27:28).

Unleashing their patented and
powerful 1-2-3 punch, the women
harriers disposed of Bucknell 18-
37.Similar to the men’s race, a
new face made its way to the
front of the Panther lineup.

Laura O’Donnell won her first
collegiate race in a personal

1 record (18:03) for the 5,000- meter

course. O’Donnell was closely
pursued by Carmela Mariani’s
second-place finish (18:10) and
Stacy Wyzykowski’s third—place
finish in 18:19.

Jen Hrach had a breakthrough-
place finish. Her time of 18:54
was a personal record. Hrach’s
finish was followed by Judy
Facey’s 7th placing in 19:26.

nmpm NEWS, Tuesday, October 1, 1991 S I 3 B ‘ g 1  A 
Calgary to burn opponents in Smythe Division 

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

The wild western Smythe
Division, which hosts four of the
league’s seven Canadian teams,
is arguably the strongest division
in hockey. This year newcomer
San Jose jumps into the Smythe,
which means powerhouses
Calgary and Los Angeles will pick
up more victories, as they play
the Sharks seven times each. San
Jose’s entrance will also have a
bearing on the ﬁnal playoff spot
in the division, because how
Vancouver or Winnipeg fair
against the expansion team will
most likely decide which team
will gain entrance to the post-
season dance.

One team that is a shoo—in for
the ball is the Calgary Flames
who for the ﬁfth or eighth year in
a row are heavy favorites to take
the coveted Stanley Cup. And
why shouldn’t they be? Goaltender
Mike Vernon has won more games
than any other netminder the last
six seasons. The offense is lethal
and the defense is top—notch. But
the Flames aren't invincible- The
media and fans have swarmed on
Vernon as the reason why the
Flames haven’t become a dynasty
like their Alberta natives
(Edmonton). The Flames, known
for their bruising, crushing style
of puck have opted for more

finesse and speed.

Theo Fleury is an example of
that. The 5-foot, 6-inch Flame
smoked 51 goals last year, and
his dazzling Canada Cup
performance showed no signs of
a let-up. Joe Nieuwendyk chipped
in his norm of 45 goals. The rest
of the offense is way deep with
scorers but lacking in size. But
injuries won’t dent this group,
the NHL’s leading gOal—sC0ring
unit the last two seasons. Look
for Soviet Sergei Makarov to
emerge as the game’s premier
Red. ‘

On defense Calgary can score
as well as hit. Al Maclnnis and
Gary Suter are the best one-two
duo in the west and power the
league’s No. 1 man—advantage
unit. Neil Sheehy, Jamie Macoun
and Frantisek Musil add size,
depth and veteran knowledge to
round out one of the league’s
finest crews. Look for them in
May.

Bruce McNall brought the
“Rocket” to Canada, and now he 
brings ﬂying Finn Jarri Kurri to '
the States to team with former
teammate and ringwearer Wayne
Gretzky. So expect a lot of goals
from the Los Angeles Kings this
season. Last year LA swiped the
division title by having a winning
record against every team in the
Smythe and winning marks
against every division. But the

real reason was the fact that the
Kings reduced their goals—against
by 85. Kelly Hrudey and Daniel
Berthiaume both won over 20
games apiece last season, but
Hrudey is the star here. LA

is still learning. “As in life, you’re
still learning in any sport. I’m still
learning even as a coach. I try to

. lead by example,” he said.

- Pak did not feel that after being

' recruited out of high school by

Geneva College that he had
learned enough. “I was cocky,
and I wanted to be a big fish but
ended up as a dumb fish in a little
pond [at Geneval,” Pak said.
Pak said in his first year at

A ,1 Geneva he did not fit in with the

ideology of the Christian college.
He wanted to get away from the
classroom, so he told his family
that he was going to Germany to
visit relatives.

During his “self-imposed exile"
in West Germany, Pak learned
something simple yet important.
“I learned about myself through

other people [in Germany. The
villagers] think that all Americans
are cocky. E

“They were convinced that I
stole another player's job away,”
he said, when in fact the coach
had substituted Pak for the other
player who had broken his ankle.
“When the other tea-ms found out
that I was an American, they
were constantly trying to show
that they were better than I was.”

Pak also traveled throughout
the German countryside, visiting
relatives and eventually attending
his cousin’s high school for a
month as “something to do.”

“It wasn’t that bad going back
to high school for a while,” he
said. ,

Pak said he learned a lot more
than German while he was
abroad. “I grew up and matured
a lot,” he said.

United States from Berlin in 1957,
and he was born nine years later
in Detroit, Mich.

“When I was eight years old, I
reallywanted to be a baseball
player. My first season was my
last, and itwas terrible. My team's
record was one and 10. I ended
my baseball career on a losing
team.”

A few years later Pak’s interest
in soccer was sparked when he
heard that his father used to be a

goalie on a team in Germany. \

The younger Pak started kicking
around when he was 10 years old
and has been behind the
checkered ball ever since.

“My father pushed me really
hard. He worked with me every
day to make me the best I could
be,” Pak said. A

Pak’s father taught him the
tactics of the game. “You have to
learn to play simple and get things
done right,” Pak said. Too many
young players try to impress
people by trying difficult ball
handling techniques, ‘Pak said,
and that is when they usually run
into trouble. “You can impress

people by doing simple things,”
he said.
“I try not to worry at all

anymore. I try to live by the right ,

things and live day to day,” Pak
said. After returning from
Germany, Pak enrolled at the
Community College of Allegheny
County and eventually found
himself on the soccer field.

“We ended up having a really
good team,” Pak said. His team
was ranked 16th in the nation,
and Pak finished the year as a
first-team All—Region player and
a third—team All-American in 1987.

Pak transferred out of CCAC to
Pitt in 1988, securing a half-
scholarship and a starting position
on the soccer team. He led the
Panthers in goals scored that year.

Pak graduated from Pitt in 1989
with a liberal studies degree with
minors in German and history.
He said that he looks forward to
getting his teaching certificate
someday. But for now Pak is
content coaching at Pitt, grinding
away at the daily practices and
teaching the younger players the

tactics that his father taught him.

Rowing
gets four
medals

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

The Pitt _rowing team
captured two gold and two
silver medals against stiff
competition this past
weekend at the ﬁfth annual
Head of the Ohio regatta.

The men’s club eight
team of Graham Turnbull,
Mike Kochera, Bert Losken,
Bob Falk, John Evers, John
Dougherty, Pete Alpern and
Matt Prechter with
coxswain Leanna Hopkins
captured the gold medal in
its division.

They finished 14 seconds
Villanova
University, the winner of
this race last year, with a
time of 13:30.

“I was really impressed
with our performance,” said
club president Turnbull.
“We took 30 seconds off of
our best team in this race.
We started off strong and
kept on going. I don’t even
remember having a bad

' stroke the entire race.”

‘The other gold medal
captured by the Pitt team
came in the women’s
lightweight four
competition. The members
of this boat were: Leslie
Burchett, Jen Whitaker,
Marcia McCurdy and Lori
Shofran. The coxswain was
Jannine Markizon.

“We had never wonga
gold in both of these races
before,” said Pitt Coachjoel
Kehm. “I think this wasa
greatshowingbyourteam.”

One silver medal was

_ captured by the men’s club

four team consisting of
Dougherty, Alpern and
Prectel with Hopkins at
coxswain. The other silver
gained by the Panthers was
won by the men’s open
double team of Kehm and
Todd Ridehour.

The women’s club eight
team finished ﬁfth in its
race. That team was made
up of Amy Meier, Dana
Jaros, Missy Miller, Andrea

Granato. The key will be how
well Kudelski is able to handle
centering the second line. Past
that, LA is not as deep as Calgary.

Marty McSorley was an
incredible +48 last year, and to
expect the same is ludicrous. The
defense is questionable. Steve
Duschene is gone, and talented
Rob Blake is now the catalyst. If
he suffers sophomoritis, the
blueliners will contribute little to
the offense. Former No. 1 pick
Daryl Sydor will geta look. Brian
Benning showed some scoring
punch, but he is lacking in the
defensive zone. Charlie Huddy
and Jeff Chychrun are
newcomers, but Rod Buskas is
still a member of this defense.
The D can not be expected to
repeat last year’s success, and the
dropoff will cost fem the division
title.

The only reason the
Edmonton Oilers will finish
third is because of goalie Bill
Ranford. His play in the Canada
Cup allowed for the trade of
Grant Fuhr.

The'Oilers still have the premier
two-way forward in hockey in
Essa Tikkanen,» but Glen Sather
has got troubles. Mark Mesier
wants out, and members of the

FOR PERSONAL‘ INTERVIEW’

years) are claiming Sather is
cheap, cheap, cheap.

The Oilers defense is not what
it used to be. Huddy is gone,
Kevin Lowe is 52 and the depth is
shaky; plus All—star Steve Smith is
holding out. Without him
Edmonton is in serious trouble.
Luke Richardson comes over from
Toronto and will add muscle, but
Edmonton needs Luke to _score,
so how he reacts will be pivotal.

Without Messier, Edmonton
lacks a legitimate center. They
dealt for Vincent Damphousse, a
crafty winger who lacks on D.
Petr Klima and Craig Simpson
remain the goal scorers, but
Edmonton needs Anatoli'
Semenov, Joe Murphy and Martin
Gelinas to gel quickly or else goal
production is stagnant. But what
the Oilers really need is Smith
and Messier back in the lineup
and happy. The Oilers have never
missed the playoffs but will face
their toughest challenge this year.
It’s up to Sather to determine

whether he wants to keep a few _

pieces of the puzzle intact or start
a major overhaul. As usual, the
Oilers should neverbe considered
out of it.

Undoubtedly one ‘of the NHL’s
most exciting teams in the playoffs
were the Vancouver Canucks,
whose short—lived run took the
Kings to a grueling six games.
Led by last—minute-trade
deadliners,-Cliff Ronning and
Geoff-Courtnall, the Kings used a
one-line scoring attack to nearly
pull the upset and to give hope
for the future. ,

Usually hope in Vancouver is
found in the summer fishing, but
this year the Canuck faithful are
eager to wave the white towel.
The Canucks own the wonderful

record of having 15 straight losing

seasons, the longest streak in’

North America, but they have
some talent and a host of left
wingers.

Ronning, Courtnall and Trevor
Linden showed in the playoffs
that this is one of the,.west’s best
lines. But for this team to become
a legitimate contender, Eastern
block superstars Igor Larionov
and Petr Nedved must prove they
can score. Greg Adams is
recovering from jaw surgery and
needs to come back at the 30-
goal clip he is used to. The penalty
units finished 18th in both
categories, and they desperately
need improvement. Ronning and
Courtnall should help the
offensive unit, while the defensive
will be counting ori a couple of
youngsters and two veterans.

Dana Murzyn and Dave Babych
both need to find their strengths,

‘Murzyn in solid bruising play and
Babych as a triggerman. If this

happens, Vancouver will be the
most improved team in hockey.
Captain Doug Lidster remains a
stronghold on defense, while
Finnish star Jyrki Lumme is

L improving.

Jason Herter, a former first-
round pick, will have ample
opportunity to strut his stuff, while
Robert Dirk and Gerald Diduck
round out a staff that isn’t real
deep but if,if,if.

The Winnipegjets have made
34 trades since December of 1988,
when general manager Mike
Smith took over. This summer
Smith laid low, hoping to
rejuvenate a team that was
extremely disappointing last tilt.

‘Bob’ Essensa is a fine young

goaltender who struggled in his
second season but retained an

excellent goals-against average
(3.15).

The defense was a major
downfall, as the Jets should have
realized that they have too many
offensive—minded blueliners. Phil
Housley, Teppo Numminen and
Fredrik Olausson are quality
triggermen, but three is a crowd.
Someone should go, because
relying on 35-year-old Randy
Carlyle to clean up your own end
is not cutting it.

There is tremendous depth at
center in Thomas Steen, Eddie
Olcyzk and newcomers Troy
Murray and Stu Barnes. The win gs
are plodding and can’t score; Pat
Elynuik is_ the only artillery,
popping in 31 goals. The Jets
have some punch at center and
on the blueline, but their wingers

are so slow they may as well be _

nonexistent. It’s time to play GM
and trade for some wingers.

The Sanjose Sharks might be
the strongest expansion team
ever, which means,they’ll receive
next year’s No. 1 overall and will
probably lose 55 to 60, games.
But they might beat up a few
teams on the way.

No‘ Shark had 20 goals last year
and only three scored in double
digits: Brian Mullen, Steve Bozek
and former Hobey Baker winner
Tony Hrkac.

So they won’t score much, nor
will they be much fun to watc
on offense. ' '

The defense will certainly be
exciting to wrestling fans, with a
host of minor-league goons and
a few North Star rejects.
Surprisingly the strength is in the
goaltending, where Jeff Hackett,
Brian Hayward and Soviet future-
star Arthur Irbe provide a dense

gI'OUp.
