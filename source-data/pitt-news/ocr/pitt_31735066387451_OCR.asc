U.S. contra-aid opposed
by nationwide Campaign  

By Scot Ross

For The Pitt News

”Why do the Contras kill those
who bring light to the communi-

ties and water to the children?”

Benjamin Linder, April 7987

The following statement was
made by American Ben Linder
just prior to his assassination by
Contra rebels. Linder, who at the
time of his death was helping
Nicaraguan citizens complete a
hydro-electric plant, strongly
urged the United States to end
support of the Contras and
Nicaraguan civil war.

Linder had been planning the

g construction of a dam in the town

F of San Jose de Bocay, Nicaragua,

when he and co—workers Pablo
Rosales and Sergio Fernandez
were brutally butchered by Con-
tra agressors. Linder, immobi-
lized from grenade shrapnel
imbedded in his legs, was then
shot at point—blank range in the
head. "

The Contras stated that Linder’s
efforts to aid the civilians of

Nicaragua made him a ”|egiti—
mate target.” T

Echoing a message of peace for
Central America, Linder’s
mother, Elisabeth Linder, along
with Ben's friend and co—worker,
Tom Kruse, have began touring
America, speaking against U.S.
intervention on behalf of the
Contras. .

On Thursday, Oct. 1, the two
spread the word at a lecture in
Forbes Quadrangle.

Opening the program was John
Beverly, a University of Pitts-
burgh Latin-American instructor.
Giving background on the Rea-
gan Administration, Beverly said
there are thousands of Americans
at work helping the civilians of
Nicaragua and that “present U.S.
government policy is putting
them in danger.” .

Beverly said she admonished
American aid to the rebels, say-
ing ”U.S. policies are supporting
and encouraging the people that
did the killings.” >

Tom Kruse, an architect from Il-
linois, spent the last 14 months in
Nicaragua. He worked with

end U.S.

Linder, assisting the civilians to
build electrical plants, schools
and hospitals. He spoke of the
horror the Contras bring to the
Nicaraguans and pleaded those
in attendance to support efforts to
1 involvement in
Nicaragua.

According to Kruse, 45 leaders
of the previously overthrown
Samosa dictatorship are within
the top positions of the Contra
forces. He said that the citizens
refer to the rebels as ”La Guardia
[The Guard].” This was also what
Samosa’s stormtroopers were
dubbed. v

”The policy of the Contras is to
win the people's hearts and
minds,” but he said that isn't

working, so they have resorted to ’
torture, murder and destruction. -

In response to his killing, a
House Committee Representative
told Mrs. Linder that by assisting
the civilians, ”[Ben] put himself
in harm's way.” -

Growing opposition to the war
has increased since the murder of

~ Ben Linder and escalated by ef-

forts to halt U.S. involvment.

For The Pitt News

Are you looking for a unique
way to earn a degree in interna-
tional studies? Well, the’ univer-
sity has the answer in the form of
the Latin American Studies
Program.

This program operates through

the Center for Latin American
Studies, which was formed at Pitt
in 1964, and since then, it has
worked its way to national and
international ‘recognition for its
high-quality education.

The faculty consists of 48 core
members along with 50 others
from outside departments. An
average of 2,700 students are en-

rolled in the program each aca-
demic year.

Undergraduates begin their
study of«Latin America through
the Related Concentration in La-
tin American Studies. Generally,
within four years they complete
five Latin American studies
courses and two years of Spanish

Supreme

favor of safety rules

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
U.S. Supreme Court on Monday

allowed Pennsylvania to keep_

strict regulations designed to in-
crease the safety of manufactur-
ing workers.

In a victory for labor organiza-
tions, the court refused to hear an
appeal of a lower court decision
that affirmed much of the state's
so-called right-to-know law even
though it was stronger than parts

‘of the federal Occupational

Saftey and Health Act.

”|t’s just a tremendous victory
for the health and safety of Penn-
sylvania workers,” said state AFL-
CIO President Julius Uehlein.
”There are portions of our law
that go beyond OSHA. Some of
those are very important.”

Rep. Mark Cohen, a Philadel-
phia Democrat who sponsored
the initial legislation, said he
hopes the decision leads to a
speedy implementation of the
provisions. . y

”This issue is oftremendous

 importance to the»,worke‘rs,"’ Co- a

longer and take fewer days off '
[sick]. We have a very firm deci- ,
sion, and we can proceed from 

there.”

The Pennsylvania law gives
state officials broad power requir-
ing employers to disclose work-
place hazards. Manufacturers

must survey chemical hazards, .
containers of hazardous ’
materials and provide informa—7
tion and training programs for

label

workers.
While similar provisions are in-

cluded in the federal OSHA, the E

state ‘law goes further by requir-

ing state officials, rather than the‘,

chemical manufacturing industry,
to compile a list of dangerous
substances.

The state law requires employ-
ers to provide hazard information

torthe general public, local police -

and fire departments, It also re-
quires manufacturers, upon re-
quest, to conduct environmental
hazard surveys. ' '

AIDS victims die faster than first thought

NEW YORK — The survival

.rate for AIDS patients is worse

than official figures suggest, with

A up to 98 percent of victims suc-

cumbing less than three years af-
_ter diagnosis, a researcher said
Monday.

The official tally of the U.S.

5 Centers for Disease Control in At-

lanta shows that about 15 percent
of AIDS victims will live longer
than three years. But a detailed
examination of long-term sur-
vivors suggests that only 2 per-
cent.to 5 percent may hang_on
that long, said Ann Hardy of the
CDC.

Hardy presented her results at
the lnterscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and

I ' Chemotherapy, a meeting devot-

ed to research on infectious
diseases.

Elsewhere at the meeting, two
researchers ' presented reports
differing sharply over whether the
AIDS virus is being spread com-
monly through heterosexual
contact.

Doctors have known for some
time that the virus can be spread
through heterosexual contact, but

”The present situation will lead
to more protection. The more
protection you have the more un-
stable the steel market will be,”
Viscount’Etienne Davignon told
320 industry officials at the 21st
annual meeting of the Interna-
tional Iron and Steel Institute.

He recommended that produc-
ing nations negotiate trade guide-
lines under the General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, -

a 30-year-old framework for
avoiding trade wars.

The emergence of steelmaking
in developing nations and the
stagnation of markets in mature
countries has fostered trade tur-
moil over the last decade. The in-
dustry has tried to solve the
problems with bilateral agree-
ments, such as the ‘quotas the
United States negotiated with in-
dividual steel-exporting nations.

. replace the Penn State artificial

heart with a human donor heart
and a kidney, doctors said.

Rev. John Urban, third
recipient of the Penn State heart,
received the organs from a Har-
risburg area man during nearly 1 1
hours of surgery Sunday, said Dr.
Walter E. Pae, a member of the
surgical team. He refused to pro-
vide any details about the donor.

Urban, of Pine Grove,
Schuylkill County, survived for
nearly 1 1 days on the one-pound
air driven pump, intended as a
bridge for ‘patients in danger of
dying before they can receive a
donor heart.

High Court to rule

on negligence claims

WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court Monday agreed
to examine the rules for compen-
sating some workers who file
negligence claims "against their
employers.

The court said it will hear an .

appeal by "Monessen South-
western Railway Co. in Pennsyl-
vania, which was ordered to pay

Anthony Nigro
Leonard Savioz

John Siford I

more than $150,000 to an in-
jured worker.

The railroad said the Pennsyl-
vania courts adopted rules for
compensating the employee,
Gerald Morgan, that violate fed-
eral law.

‘Morgan injured his back in
1977 when he fell from a railroad
car. He filed a negligence suit un-
der the Federal Employers Liabil-
ity Act.

National Guardsman

may sue, court says

WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court Monday allowed
a black National Guardsman
from Pennsylvania who claims he
was discharged because of racial
prejudice to sue for rein-
statement. _

The court, without comment,
rejected arguments by state offi-
cials that Ulus Jorden’s lawsuit
should be thrown out.

Jorden, who in 1956 became
the first black to enlist in the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard,
sued after his discharge in 1984.

DR. RI.|'I'I-I
WESTHEIMER

 
The fact is, many people don't
want to talk about this subject

and it hasn't much importance 5

whether the talker is gay or
straight — intimate sex talk is un-
pleasant to many, many people
and they don't have to take part
in it.

Q: I have read a number of
your columns in which you give
advice to virgins. It has given me
comfort, and also I don’t_feeI su-

perior to women who have chos— .

en another road. But I have a
persistent worry about not being
able to function sexually if and
when Ido hook up with a man.

A: There is too much worrying
about being able to function sex-
ually before ever trying it. Lots of

"people go into sex with a nice

partner and do not_find it so hard.
It is not such a big deal, or doesn't
have to be, I advise you to read
some of the good books and‘to

The president and

his backdoorfriends

The Associated ‘Press reported this week that the Office of
Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean, a pub-
licity agency attached to the State Department, had engaged
in ”white propaganda.” The report cited a column that had ap-
peared in the Wall Street Journal, attributed to John F‘. Guil-
martin, that failed to mention his involvement with the office.

Also, the report indicated that the congressional committee
investigating the Iran-Contra scandal had obtained a memo in-
dicating that there were to be press releases from the office at-
tributed to various Contra leaders including Adolpho Calero.

There are a number of possibilities for why the present ad-
ministration feels compelled to engage in such activity. There
could be an agenda for Central America that the American pub-
lic has not yet learned of —- providing the motivation for this
type of subversion. Another, and far less attractive rationale,
could be that ‘there is nothing at all unusual about the activi-

ties of this office. It could be that they are merely conducting '

business as usual, with the public again being taken for fools.

Too many times, the present administrationhas employed’

tactics that are hardly commendable to accomplish foreign poli-
cy goals. Repeatedly, we see a cowboy attitude, until now,
reserved for the silver screen. ’

But all that is painfully obvious. A person can only be shocked
by abuses of power so often. It appears as though we are stuck
with this president for the next 15 months, and there is very
little hope for change. L

When we go to the polls next November, we should be look-
ing for someone not quite so zealous, not quite so dangerous.

A thank you note

from a happy reader

It seems Mr. Young took some of my advice and watched No
Repeat Monday on MTV, apparently to lick the wounds of his fragile
male ego and to launch a second blatant display of outrage against
women.

Come now, Mr. Young, don't you think once was enough? Exactly
what did you prove with your rebuttal to the letterjprinted in the Sept.
28 Pitt News, that you are not only a sexist but also a beer-guzzling
couch potato? Impressive. »

I am more concerned that you lack journalistic ethics by using in-
complete research in your articles, like -the ones on videos. You chose
a limited number. And you show a lack of objectivity. It seems you
want a parade of semi-nude dancing women in a video, or you don't
like it.

You make'a great negative role model as a journalist Mr. Young.
But you've given yourselfmore credit than you deserve as a sexist.
Who gave you the title of ”King Chauvinist?” You are one of many,
I'm afraid, but hardly king. I admit I was flattered at such a heated
response from my letter, but I think it's gone far enough. [...]

It's been an entertaining but dismally enlightening correspondence,
but let's move on to another topic. Since you're a staff writer on The
Pitt News, you must have journalistic ability. Just leave your macho
ideas at home on the recliner next time. -

It can feel good to help out

It's been a pretty ‘wild week in
the Naked City. Well, moderate-
ly wild any way. It's only been a
week since the Naked City was
put on the map. I keep waiting to
hear from new citizens, so far I'm

, the only one, and until I get some I

input from the citizenry, "you're
stuck hearing about my exploits.

‘At I2:30_Ha.m. last Saturday, I
got out of work and found myself
stranded on Centre Avenue. The

buses had stopped running, so I .

was stuck with a 45-minute walk
home. »

I was in a particularly bad
mood, and I was hoping that
someone would come up and
talk to me just so I could vent
some frustration. The streets were
deserted, so myopportunity to
yell at a stranger wasn't going to
materialize. ‘

I was bored and tired. When
I'm bored and taking a long walk
that's against my will, I sing. So
I sang ”Bobby Magee" in my best
Janis Joplin voice. It was great
fun. I '

I was still singing when I made
it into Oakland. I was crossing
Craig Street in front of St. Paul's
Cathedral. ”Freedom’s just
another word for nothing left to
lose" were the last words out of
my mouth when the stranger I
had hoped to meet, stopped me.
I took a good look at her, and my
need to yell left.

She was a middle aged subur-
ban housewife-looking woman.
She was crying. - .

”Could you please help me?"

I really felt bad for her.

I asked her what I could do to
help, a little callously I'll admit.

”I've never been in Oakland

’before, I'm lost, and all I need is

to hail a cab and get back to Mon-
roeville. I've been waving at
them as they pass by, but none
of them will stop.”

‘ I explained to her that it is next
to impossible to hail a cab from
the street in Oakland which
brought on another flood of tears.

"I'm so scared. The only thing
I know is that it's dangerous as
hell to walk these streets alone at
night/.’

I told her she should be glad

I that she's not stranded downtown

which got a li.ttle laugh out__0f her.

cab?”

I told her I would, so we
walked over to Webster Hall to
use a pay phone. I put my arm
around her, and she started sob-
bing again. ”

"I'm so glad that I met you, I
don't know what I would have
done/’

I explained that it was no
problem, and that I was glad that
I could help her. I asked her how
she got stranded in the first place. '

”I got separated from my hus-
band and kids after the football
game." .

I wondered to myself what they
were doing now, after having lost

_their wife/mother nearly three

hours ago.

We walked into Webster Hall,
and I called Yellow Cab. She kept
trying to get my name from me
because she wanted to send me
some money for helping her out.
But I was getting such a rush from
helping her, I told her that I didn't
want any. ’

We walked outside, and the
cab showed up minutes later. I
helped her into the cab, and she
went off into the night.

Before the cab left, she rolled if

down.the window and asked if
there were anything that she
could do for me, to which I re-
plied; ”If you are ever in the po-
sition to help somebody out like
I helped you, don't walk away.”

I couldn't believe those words
came out of my mouth. It was a
wonderful feeling, though.

I finished my walk through
Oakland. I was so happy that I'd
stopped. Try being nice to a

J stranger someday, it's wonderful. I

This just in. There is a new
citizen of the Naked City, and her
name is Sandra Bernhard. You
know, the lady from David Let-
terman, the same -lady who's per-
forming at the Carnegie Music
Hall on Thursday night. I just
talked to her on the phone — no
lie. She is very pleased to be in-
volved in our little town, and is

willing to do anything to help. 1
Well, maybe not anything. -But. ‘

she expressed keen interest.
Maybe we'll make it to David Let-
terman, kids. It would be a real
good idea for a whole lot of peo-
ple to go to her show this week.
She is a howl.

THE PITT NEWS

Quarterback Sal Genilla and the rest of the Panthers have let the ‘Tgervnpgleé andg.gBostonMCo|gIege gamesﬂslipg through their grasps.’

Look good? They don't even sound good

I wasn't at the game this past
Saturday. _

Instead, right before_the kickoff
and before that first intercepted
pass, I was driving somewhere on
an old country road near my
home to meet a very old femme
acquaintance I was going to take
to a party.

”Ah hah," I can hear some of
you saying this very moment,
”because he wasn't at the game
that means we don't have to read

any of his belabored empathy ne .

sarcasm about the football team
for the third week in a row.”

Wrong.

You see, while I was driving, I
had the radio on in my car.

' I think I'll change my scenario
a little this week. Instead of me

" commenting about how the Pan-
thers looked in the game this past
weekend, let's talk a little about
how they sounded.

I have always enjoyed football
over the radio; it always keeps
you interested -and lets your im-
agination get some much need-
ed exercise. ’

And furthermore, this was one
game I was really excited over.
All week, while listening to com-

ments from friends and non-
friends about how sorry the Pan-
thers were beginning to look and
how badly they were going to
lose to Boston College, I
spearheaded their cause. ”No,
no,” said I, "Gottfried has really
got them fired up for this one.
They have seenthe errors of their
ways and should win this by at
least nine points. They have the
talent, you know.” ‘

So, there I was, rolling down a
lane past 100—year—old farm-
houses listening to Bill Hillgrove
on WTAE callthe opening plays
of the game.

Kickoff —— good. Defense on
three plays — good. They have to
punt — good.

Then I heard this.

”And Genilla goes back to

‘ pass, he throws, and it's  it's 

intercepted by Murphy.” _
”Intercepted? Intercepted!” My
mind raced. ”This is bull—," I
thought to myself (and probably
said to myself also, I can't remem-

ber), ”Hillgrove must need new -

glasses. There is just no way and
in just a little over a minute." .

But my worst nightmare at the
moment was true. And there was

either some demon or a small
troll running around in my gut
telling me things really weren't
going to get much better.

This condition was not solely
due to the fact that Sal ”And the
Pass was Intended For” Genilla

' kept screwing up. Iwill still con-

tend he has it in him to be a very
‘good quarterback. It's just that
right now he has somehow mis-
placed his talent. '

deluge, perhaps moreso than any
other player.

And it's not too much fun while
you're trying to rekindle an old
flame with impressive sports sto-
ries of your Division I school to
hear the entire student body boo
the starting quarterback for the
team while he's coming off of the
field.

The only time I thought the
Panthers would be able to break
out of their rut was when during
the second quarter they pushed
onward and upward 57 yards in
nineplays for their only touch-
down. This drive is truly to be
commended. It almost sounded
like the Pitt of old.

And, of course, the player
almost entirely responsible was
Craig Heyward. Good job, Iron.

But, Iron only.

For the past three weeks now,
ever since the loss to Temple, I
have vehemently spouted off
about stupid mistakes, unneeded
fumbles and/or penalties, cup-
cake teams, "should have won”
losses, unvanquished talents and
potentials and basically every-
thing _which goes along with
them. Perhaps, and only now do
I realize this, I should reassess my
outlook.

Pitt women's volleyball team

traveled to New Jersey, Eastern
Pennsylvania and Washington,

D.C., this past weekend for a full

_ slate of victories.

Friday night, the Lady Panthers
faced the Lady Pirates of Seton
Hall in a Big East Conference
matchup and beat them easily
15-3, 15-5 and 15-3.

On Saturday, the Lady Panthers

went to Villanova for another Big '

 

East battle. Again, the Lady Pan-
thers won with the scores of
15-12, 15-8 and 15-6.

Next, the University of Penn-
sylvania fell prey to the outstand-
ing spiking powers of the feline
femmes. The result was another
15-9, 15-8 and 15-5 victory.

But the action went on for
another day.

On Sunday, they met George-
town for yet a third conference
match. Pitt won 15-12, 11-15,
15-10 and 15-6-.

chained, the Lady Panthers faced
the University of Virginia lady
Cavaliers, winning 15-3, 15-11
and 15-6.

The team as a whole improved 1

its record to 18-2 overall and 6-0
in the Big East Conference and
are currently in first place. The
Lady Panthers have now won 10
consecutive season matches and
16 in the Big East.

’’I was most pleased to be able
to play five matches in three ci-
ties and to be able to win the con-
ference matches to stay in first
place in the Big East,” said head
coach Shelton Collier, after this
grueling weekend of war.

”We have two important goals
right now,” he continued. ”First,
to win the Big East, and second,
to qualify for NCAA’s. If we
would have lost this weekend, it
would have putdamper on both
goals.”

Seniors Louise O’Shaughnessy
and Lisa Stewart were both key
players this weekend. Collier
said, ”Louise and Lisa both
played very well and helped our

”Our biggest match to date was
the Indiana match. They had
beaten us by close scores the past
four years by always 5-4 or 6~3,”
said women's tennis coach Ge-
orge Dieffenbach. ”The team
came together, to play a strong In-
diana team. Six of those matches
went three sets. We won three
and they won three.

”The key matches were the
No. 1 seed with Tracy, the No.
2 seed with Carrie and No. 3
seed Bonnie  DeVera and
Mclntyre of the No. 3 seed dou-
bles pulled out not only the dou-

bles but the single. It was .

Mclntyre’s best match of the
year," added Dieffenbach.
In Sunday's game, Pitt dominat-

’ ed the Lady Colonials of RMC,

9'-0. Pitt did not allow the Coloni-
als to win one set. ,_ ,
DeVera, playing in the first

seed of the singles (Feltingoff,

didn't participate in this match)
defeated Susan Gebauer 6-6, 6-1.
Bonnie Kartzman also won with
relative ease over Karen Fisher
6-1, 6-2. ,

Mclntyre continued her ‘out-
standing play this week by beat-
ing Marci Rubino 7-6, 6-2, while
teammate Jaffe defeated Melissa
Lokey by identical 6-2, 6-2
scores. 3 '

The fifth- and sixth-seeded sin-
gles players, Hunt and Cohen,

 Pitt's Tracy Feltingoff sets. ‘herself to r

whitewashed Karen Pavlic and
Lauren Listisen by similar scores
of 6-0, 6-0.

In doubles action, DeVera and
Kartzman defeated Gebauer and
Lokey 6-3, 6-2. Jaffe and Cohen
had an easy time with Fisher and
Melvin 6-2, 6-2, while teammates
Hunt and Marnie Bowser finished
the shutout by defeating Pavlic
and Listisen 6-3, 6-1.

’’It was a real team effort. Every-
one made an effort,” said
Dieffenbach. ’’All the women are
contributing to the team. That,
plus the Bucknell win, gives this
team spirit; it helps make us
stronger.

With the team's recent success,
a slow start may be the only nega-

. tive aspect at this point.

”The first part of our schedule
was difficult. We were 0-3 at a
certain point, then we beat Buck-
nell, which really encouraged
us,” Dieffenbach said.

The four-match winning streak

began Sept. 23 against West V

Liberty State College, with the
score of 7-2. Next, the Lady Pan-
thers shut out Duquesne 9-0;
then came the IUP and Robert
Morris ‘matches.

Pitt will put its streak on the

line today as they face host West
Virginia University at 3:30 p.m.
then travel to ‘Slippery Rock
University for a match on
Thursday.

Webster uncertain
about next season

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Pitts-Z

burgh Steelers’ center Mike Web-
ster, who defied striking
teammates _last week by crossing
their picket line, won't decide
whether to retire until the end of
the season.

Webster had said last weekend

in Atlanta that~he wouldn't hesi— ‘

tate to quit it his striking team-

mates’ open animosity didn't’

disappear.

”,Maybe that was an emotion-
al statement,” Webster said Sun-
day after the Steeler replacement

team's 28-12 victory over Atla_n— .

ta. ”Maybe physically I can't play
anymore. I really don't want to
comment anymore because I've

i been running off_-at'the"mouth too

much.”

When the Steeler strike team
arrived Saturday in Atlanta, Web-
ster had said,‘ ’’Obviously, I'm

done here I've created a lot of

animosity, but I did what I_

thought was right, right or wrong.
I regret it had to come to that.”

Webster, 35, also said ”There’s
a big generation gap between me
and the group that's in there right

ll

ROW.

At his weekly news conference
Monday, Steelers Coach Chuck
Noll said Webster. remains a top-
caliber NFL offensive linemen
but is the only person who can
decide whether he still wants to
play. . . _  

”Webby’s' had a great career,

but he's been struggling’ with that . w

L’ [retirement] for a' couple of

years,” Noll said. ”Webby is a
guy that plays very well. He's like

a coach on the field. He's a smart.

player and uses that intelligence

' very well.”
