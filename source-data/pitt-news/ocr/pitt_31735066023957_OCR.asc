The monthly rent will be based

By CLARE GLEASON
’ Pitt News Staff Writer
The Student Health Center is
enacting a procedure designed to
minimize student waiting time, ac-

 cording to a report by Bernie
l.Palowitch at yesterday’s Student
,~ Government Board meeting.

“About 95 percent of the com-
plaints are about the wait involved
when visiting the health center,”
Palowitch said. Franklin Carter,
the new director of the health

" center,. has outlined a new office

procedure which should reduce the
waiting time. ‘

By NICK ARNETT

Pitt News Staff Writer

A College students are doing a
“miserable” job of getting involved
in politics, according to Anne Welx-

er, President Carter's Assistant for
Public Liason. Wexler held’a White
House-arranged telephone press
conference yesterday with The Pitt

» News and the student newspapers

of the universities of Massachusett
and Vermont. ._ -

“_I personally am a great propo-

nent of the participation of people .
. between the ages of 18 and 25,”

Wexler said. “The most miserable
performance of anybody in our
society in terms of exercising their

‘ ‘rights of citizenship are young peo-

ple.

“You have the worst record in
terms of turnout in voting of any
group in our society, which is very
troubling. We have tried very hard
through voter registration opera-

a doctor. So what he’s done is com-
piled them on a new sheet so when

- students come in, attendants will

sort out the students who need to
see a doctor from those with the
problems on the list, in an attempt
to decrease waiting time,”
Palowitch pxplained. I « I
Carter also hired another doctor
and physican’s assistant in an at-
tempt to serve students more effi-
ciently. The board reported that
Carter hasiplans to utilize a mobile
cart that could be used for taking
blood pressure and other things for
use in the university community.
In other business the board voted
to extend the application deadlines
for the Media and Publications

tions, ‘get out the vote’ opeﬁations
and through ‘this extensive‘ calling
program to try and stimulate some

interest and activity.” I

' ' Wexler described her position as,

“Generally to work with special-
interest groups and iridividuals and
the public at large to build support.
coalitions and consensus behind

.priority presidential programs.”

Asked -which .specia‘l-interest

groups the president considered

most important to his re-election,
Wexler responded, “It would be
hard to single out any special-
interest group which is more crucial
than any other. The president is in

the unique position of always,

representing the national interest
and having to kind.o‘f balance and
measure off the needs of almost
everyinterest group in a way that
builds consensus and coalitions
around ‘issues in the national in-
terest.” A ’

Wexler__sai_d she has _/worked ex-

B‘oard and the Pitt,.Program Coun-
cil boards of governors until. next

_ Friday. There are two positions

available for Media and ‘Publica-
tions and three for PPC board of
governors. Applications and con-
stitutions of the respective groups
are available in the student govern-
ment offices on the third ﬂoor of
Schenley Hall. ~ --

After much controversy, the
board voted to approve the new
election code as presented by the
student government Elections Com-
mittee, after correcting objectional L
articles. « ‘

The new student government
election code was the subject of

tensively in the past to persuade

‘young people to.vote, but she said '

since the Vietnam ‘era, students
have become less interested. “I hap-
pen to think it’s a terrible mistake
because I thinkthat every issue or
major concern both ‘domestically

. and on the foreign policy side has
’ an impact on your lives, especially if

\we have to make tough" decisions

which relate to‘ federal -budgets ‘

which have-‘an enormous impact on
students as applies to education
funding, research and development,
and student assistance. So I think
you’re making a mistake if_ you
don’t vote.” . ‘

According to Wexler, the Carter‘
adminstration has increased federal
support /of student loans five-fold
over the Ford administration’s last
budget._ “Generally, our approach’
to the whole area of aid for students
is that any "student who wants to go
to college should not be denied the

_ right_to do so on the basis of ﬁnan-

much controversy at the SGB
meeting yesterday.

The new code stated that student
government candidates would be
limited to a maximum personal ex-
penditure of $60 plus contributions
from recognized student organiza-
tions and university undergraduate
students. ,

“We feel there is more ofa per-
-sonal interest involved in getting

.student organizations to contribute

to your campaign,” said Elections
Committee member Gerry Weiss.
“That"involves you going out to
them, reaching out to their interests
and involving them,” Weiss added. .
“If you open it up to
undergraduate students, then the

cial ‘problems’,” Wexler said. She
added that the administration does
not support tax credits to students
“or their families. ‘
Wexler said educational oppor-
tunities to members of thesvolunteer

_- dent wins re-election. She said the

administration favors legislation to

“There should be a little more ex-

said Joseph Knapp, of Pharmacy}
—"‘Just because you leave doesn’t

The subject of the university be-

test,” Weiss‘ said. ,

“I’m really against getting per-
sonal contributions from
students,” Weiss said.

“I don’t think it’s in the
democratic process to allow special
interest groups to contribute. and
not to allow the individual to con-
tribute,” said board member Scott
Hendler.

The board voted to deny can-
didates from soliciting funds from
students.’ \

The primary issue of controversy
regarding‘ the election code was the

increase military benefits. “The
president has just signed and 11.9%

increase in military pay, which I
think should at least increase some

of the possibility and reasons for-

people to join the volunteer army.”
Wexler said she didn’t know if the

president would support restoring

educational benefits to veterans.

“We must foster community and

On the same note, Virgil Cantini,

that there should be some way of re- ,

Pitt,students' will never produce major concerts
on this campus.
- tWhy?

. Because students are not responsible enough or
-capable of handling the hard work that must be

"devotedto producing a major concert.

That’s what the‘critics said back in 1968 when
the Pitt‘ Program Council (known then as the Pitt
Union Program Council) came into existence.

_> But now, in 1980, the Program Council has only '
begun to prove the critics wrong as it continues to

 C make 1980 the biggest and best year of programm-

ing that the University of Pittsburgh has ever seen.
Thus far, the Program Council has managed to

I promote some outstanding programs of interest to

all Pitt students, including the Homecoming ’80

festivities and the upcoming Pure Prairie League -
‘ concert.

' same‘ respect,

certainly catered to the ‘needs of even the most ac-
tive students, bringing such guests as former UN
ambassador Andrew Young. .

Although there is always room for improve-
ment, the Program Council is ‘certainly one

organization that Pitt students can be proud of 

and at the same time see some tangible benefits‘

from their precious student activity fee monies.
When an organization which deals with student

activities fee money makes a questionable move,

_The Pitt News is usually the first to p_ublic1y.iques- ‘
tion the motives behind such moves. But In the
when such an organization is .‘

responsible for a ‘‘job well done” we should be
the first to offer. congratulations. ‘

We are all students striving for the same.
idealistic goals‘ of perfection, goals that are
sometimes well beyond our means.

The Pitt Program Council, just like The Pitt
News,‘ Student Government, and almost every
other ‘student organization has had its share of

rocky times, but it, like all the others, has survived.

\\.

‘People like:

Associate Director of Student Activities Terry
Milani who was there at the inception of the Pro-
gram Council to offer advice, encouragement, and
moral support through even_ the toughest of times.

Without Milani’s continued confidence in the
Program Council «it wouldhave never reached its
present levels of excellence.

And Director of Student.Activities Andy Smith,
who pushed for passage of an increased student

' - activities‘ fee so that more money might be

available to organizations like the Program Coun-
cil. " ‘- “

Early on, Smith recognized the potential of the
Program Council and worked hard so that the
organization might realize that potentialf

And last but not ’least,,the students who have

— A very serious problem has

-‘ , developed at this university that af-

fects every CGS student here and,

indirectly, every day school student.

_ Every activity that the Pitt

Programming Council plans is vir-

tually free to all non-CGS under-

graduates, while disallowing CGS

participation, mat a higher cost, if
at‘aIl.

The problem has been caused by

whatever their reasons, has spread a
paramount case of apathy through
much of the CGS student body.

Cabinet Council.  The Council has
not allocated any funds to -the Pitt
Programming Council, whose
budget was increased after a rise in
day school activities fees.

Tom Hajduk, president of the
Student ‘ Cabinet Council, has

detracted very successfully from the"

once popular CGS mixers. After
the Social Committee. had
eliminated soft drinks from the
mixers,. Hajduk instituted the
requirement of proof of age (21
years old) just to enter the door.
This is the mainstay of how the
average CGS students get their
money’s worth for their activities

stantiation. I can sit‘in a bar in
Latrobe and hear the same thing
from a bunch of drunken, bleary-
eyed armchair quarterbacks.

I also got a kick out of his article
in the Monday paper following the
FSU game. Panthers can kiss a ma-
jor bowl bid goodbye. This is a
ludicrous statement when the
season is still so young, and when
the contenders are getting beaten
one by one. Still, I'm sure that
most of the guys in the bar would
agree with him. — I -

In this article, a particular section
exemplified the narrow-minded bias
that is characteristic of Mike's uni-
que writing form. He said that the
first downs made by each team were
relatively even, 17 to 16 in favor of
State. But since FSU got more of
their first downs on_the ground, he.

 said‘ it .$hQ.W.¢d, clearly .‘ ‘how . they

fee- We would like to propose "a

question to Mr. Hajduk: How do

you suggest the CGS students under
21 get their money’s worth from

_ our activities fee without the mixers

and the ‘same privileges offered to
day students through the Pitt Pro-
gramming Council? V

Bill Abraham, president of SGB,
contacted Tom Hajduk in an at-

tempt for both the day and evening a

schools to work together.

However, the CGS refused to join a

in a collective effort with SGB‘in
supporting activities for the
students through the Pitt Program-
ming Council. During the CGS

elections last March, every can-
didate proposed both the obvious
and numerous ‘advantages of
collaborating with the SGB. Unfor-
tunately, Tom H.ajduk has
neglected to utilize his position in
the SCC to benefit the CGS stu-
dent. The college experiences of
young men and women can, and
will, affect many things later on in
their lives. The CGS student is be-

‘ ing deprived of ‘a. very" important

part of their education—the inter-
action in the university community.

We, and many other CGS
students involved with day school
students and their activities in vary-

a first down is a first down, and if involved. i-n a particular situation.

they’re fairly even, _they’re fairly
even. Let’s turn that around and
say that Pitt got more first downs in
the air. Why then, didn’t the Pan-
thers dominate the game because of
this? s _
To get recognized as an authority
on sports, one has to sound like he
is at least vaguely aware of the facts

So could you please tell this col-
legiate Myron Cope that if he wants
to speculate, he can do it in an
obscure tavern somewhere.

I would also at this time like to ’

_submit my name for consideration,
should Mike feel that it is his duty
to the school to put his application
in for coach, in which_,case he’d

ing extents, propose the idea of a
liaison for SCC and SGB to be able
to work together. This would be in
the best interests of all concerned.
But then again, is that what the
CGS Student Cabinet Council is
really working for? I

  Fraternities Getting Along with New Regulations A

. By MIKE MALLIN GER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Most fraternities are abiding by
and in fact, seem pleased with the
new regulations governing open
parties and rush.

The rules took effect this Septem-
ber and limit open rush parties to
the first two weeks of the term.

During the next two weeks rush is to ,

be by invitation only.

Regarding campus-wide parties,
the policy is one open party per
house per term. . .

Qon Parella, president of the
Interfraternity Council, (IFC), said
that the IFC was overwhelmingly in
favor of the new rules and that they
were a step in the right direction.

So far the ruling on rush has had
little effect on the fraternities, ac-
cording to Parella. He said’he
doesn’t expect that there will be any
bad effects in the future.
number of pledges has been about
the same as in past years, Parella
said.

“A lot more people are going to
want to join fraternities to get’ in-
volved with the parties,” Parella
said. V ‘

He is “very much in support of

the rule” allowing one party per

house per term. Brothers are a lot
closer within the house, according
to Parella, a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. ‘ ‘ i

The Executive Board of the Inter- .

fraternity Council passed the mo-
tion last spring because of com-
plaints from Oakland neighbor-
hoods and damage to fraternity
houses.

Parella said he was “surprised at
the attitude it was passed with,” ‘ad-
ding, “Everything on this campus is
behind the times.’_’ He said that
fraternities had been on the decline.
and members of the IFC wanted to
‘see if the _new regulations would
help. '

The people voting on. the

"measures were juniors and seniors

“tired of "open parties every week-
end” where they didn’t know the

people present, Parella added.

Large parties broke even finan-
cially over the short run ‘but pro-
blems of stuffed toilets, broken
windows and stained carpets forced
the ‘fraternities to reconsider the
open party policy. ‘

Louis McLinden, assistant direc-
tor of student activities, said the
new rulings are “for the best in-

terest of IFC. ,
“Why should the frats serve as '

the, social life for the entire
campus,” McLindon said.

.. Fraternities have no respon-
sibility to the school to have open
parties, according to McLindon.

“Fraternities intend on having
those who are interested in going to
parties become members of the
fraternity system,” McLinden add-
ed. ‘

A Pitt News survey of fraternities
shows:

   
  

THE NAONA

At Delta Sigma Phi the new rules
were received favorably. The two
week open rush helped and
“specifically the closed rush gave us

a better chance to talk with the S
_ rushees,” according to Delta Sigma

Phi members. The loud noise and
big crowds at‘open parties was not a
comfortable situation for ’Delta
Sigma Phi. ,

The new rulings have not chang-
ed the spirit of the fraternity but
Delta Sigma Phi now looks at them-
selves as something special, not
something to be used. - .

Chris McFarlin of Phi‘ Gamma
Delta said that. the rush ruling
“made us be a little bit more selec-
tive. It made rush a little bit

. harder.” He added that the _frater—

nity has become more selectiveand
only allows invited guests over.
Louis Shapiro, president of Pi
Lambda Phi said, ‘.‘It’s a different
system that’_s hard to get used to.
You-don’t have zoo parties.” Older

« brothers like the new rules. During

past years partyers had “messed up
the house and lef .”

The treasurer of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon said that the frat".did»not
have a very good rush because they
were used to open parties.

(‘The new rules have hurt us
more than ‘ they’ve helped us, ’ ” he
said. ' ' A -

Charlie Burrows, president of
Delta Sigma Chi,’ ‘said that the
fraternity has yet to make the new
policy work for them. It has had no
effect "on morale, Burrows said.

- Phi Delta Theta president Jeff
Corbett was steadfastly against the
new restrictions. A

like to advertise that week,” "Cor-

bettsaid. He found the policy “a
useless restriction.”

Corbett was also against the party
policy and said that it is “a way for
the -IFC to deal with problems on

‘ Bayard. We haven’t had a lot of

complaints. The IFC is restricting
us for problems on Bayard.”
President Don Phillips of Phi
Kappa Theta was glad to see an end
to unlimited open parties. “All you

get into the house are a lot of

drunken vandals,” he said.
He said that in at least one case
the rules governing rush were not
adhered to. One frat was handing
out leaflets advertising a party
welcoming back brothers which was
also to be used to rush freshmen.
Phillips added that the policing of
the rules was very poor.

Pi Kappa Alpha treasurer Larry
Duckett said the new rules “pro-

mote a lot less spending.” The frat '

has spent half of last year’s total.
Rush- last year went on for a month
and a half and anyone could get a
rush card, party and not join. The
restrictions “make a person want_ to

, join more,” he added.

Zeta Beta Tau’s president had no
comment. A

Vice President Bill Simon of
Delta Tau Delta found one open
party a “good step.” “It’s timetwe
took some action like that,” he
said. The rules have helped
neighborhood relations ‘and rush.
More‘pe,ople would join a frat if
they knew that there would be only
one party, he added.

T Biinldey Trial Postponed Until
  Philly Trial 

- By JANE HOLAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
The trial of Sidney Brinkley, the
accused murderer of Pitt co-ed

Monica Renee _Jones has been

postponed until January 5, pending _

completion of another trial in which

Brinkley is accused of killing an"

Atlantic Richfield executive in
Philadelphia. . ' V

Brinkley, 24, a former construc-
tion worker from Philadelphia, is
accused of murdering and raping
Pitt student Monica Renee Jones,
18, last January 4, in the Tower A
basemet. Jones’ body was found in
the trash room of the Towers.

Brinkley allegedly lived in Tower
B with Pitt student Estelle Hill for
almost two months, in violation of

University’ housing rules, from
December through January, 1979.

- He is also accused of murdering ,

Hill’s sister Sheila, 15.
The commonwealth is asking for

a charge of murder in the first '
degree, which carries a mandatory ,

life sentence or the death penalty if
the jury so decides.

He is now on trial for the murder
of Nancy Ross, 32, an Atlantic
Richfield executive from

. Philadelphia.

Brinkley will be brought back to
Pittsburgh on December 15, but
because a jury trial (which Brinkley
has requested) is not held during the
holiday season, the trial is expected
to _last three weeks.

Tennessee Volunteers fora first-
ever confrontation.

Majors, of course, is the man
who initiated the 180 degree tur-
naround in the Pitt football pro-
gram. In that turnaround, Majors
was assisted by his right hand man
Sherrill, who is now being calling a
matchup between he and Majors
ridiculous.‘ ~ _

_ “I don’t have to play and John
Majors doesn’t have to play. It’s
the players who have to play,” said

Although the Volunteers were
soundly defeated by number one

. ranked Alabama last week, Pitt

assistant coach Bob Davie is wary.
“You shouldn’t get false impres-‘

M sions of the Tennessee team by their

loss to Alabama on national TV,”
he said. .“We’ve seen their game

films and they are an excellent-

team. ’ ’ \ ‘

Sherrill echoes Davies’ sen-
timents. . ' ‘
,“Tennessee is an excellent foot-

.ball team,” he said. “Without a

, _ doubt they are the best football
‘ team’ in the country that’s 3-—-3.
Also, they probably nerve ‘the "

- top ranked Alabama (275—0), fifth‘,
and

greatest team speed of anyone in the
country.” . ..¢.-

\
The Volunteers’ 3-—-3 trleciord is
misleading in that Tennessee has
lost to three good football teams:

ranked Georgia (16-15),
number eight USC (20—)-17). The
Vols have defeated Washington
State (35-23), Georgia Tech

3 (23--10) and a good Auburn team

(42-0).
As far as speed is concerned, the
Tennessee offense boasts of three

receivers with 9.5 sprinting speed. -

 Spikers Have Big Eastem Tournament  

By~ SCOT STONE
Pitt News Sports Writer I -
This weekend the Pantherette
volleyball team returns to the East
with a. tournament at the University
of Maryland. Among the twenty
teams invited, Pitt will face North
Carolina, Virginia and Delaware in
the round robin competition.
Pantherette coach Shelton Collier
is expecting the most difficulty
from the North Carolina team.
“We’re expecting North Carolina

‘« to be our toughest. match in the
‘ round robin,” Collier said. ‘‘It’s a

large school with a good sports
tradition and they have -.a pretty

good women’s sports program.”

t

“We’re expecting to beat them,”

.. Collier said, “but we also expect

them to give us a good match.”

_ The Maryland match is impor-
tant for the Pantherette team as a
test of their ability to beat the teams
in their division.

“This weekend we’ll meet all the
teams we will have to beat for the

 nationals,” Collier said “and so,

we’ll be able to tell if we’ve improv-
ed from these past tournaments
with national caliber teams.” ‘~

.V,‘

“I think,” Collier added, “after
being-exposedto that level of play,
the team is prepared to work to
achieve that level for themselves.”

This -weekend the Pantherettes)
will be shufﬂeing between an old
offensive arrangement and a new
one centered around, Julie Gaul. _

“Last tournament was our first
using Julie Gaul,” Collier said. “I

‘Field Hockey Team Beats ‘Slippery Rock, 3-] 

By COLLEEN McDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pantherette coach Martha Lud-
wig has a winning team. The Pitt
Women’s Field Hockey team suc-
cessfully defeated Slippery Rock,
3-1, in their sixth straight winof
the season last Friday.

‘,‘It was an excellent game all

» around,” said Coach Ludwig, “We

came out romping in the first half
and our timing and stick work was
right there.” ‘

Pitt began by taking the lead
when the ball was deflected off the

“Linda Stadler will» not play with
us on’ Friday,” Collier said, “and
we’ll have three other starters-
Maria Perez, Diane Zack. and,

was in the right positioning to tap it
in, said Ludwig. Libby Sharp
followed with the ‘Pantherettes se-
cond goal. -Sharp hammered a hard
shot on goal to put Pitt ahead 2-0.

“‘We were hit with a little bit of
fatigue in the second half,” said
'1 Ludwig, “basically because we’ve

been playing slower teams than-

Slippery Rock.” .
Slippery Rock’s chance came in

the second half on a break away

ball.’ «Colleen Ahem, the Pitt

goalie,’ pulled out in the correct_

positioning, said Ludwig, and it
, was. a one-on-one attack. “There’s

.v. ',  '

Paula Olsen—staying in Pittsburgh
Friday’ because of classes.

“Without four starters,” Collier
added, “it will give us a good in-
dication of the level of our bench
strength.” '

One reserve that will be heavily
relied on‘ is the 5-foot-10 blocker,
Robin Kuklias.

V “She’ll be playing a.major role’

a 50-50 percent chance in goalie
against forward situations,” said
Ludwig. Slippery Rock slipped by
on this one with a shot to score their
only goal of the ‘game.

Pitt\’s Hall countered and scored

‘ on a second hard shot to the Slip-

pery Rock goal to insure the Pan-
therettes lead 3-1. “Both shots by

_ Sharp and Hall were beautiful,”

said Ludwig, “ the kind of shots
you dream about.”

“Colleen played an excellent
game also,” said Ludwig. ’ Ahern
had eight saves on Slippery Rocks
11 shots. Pitt took 20 shots on goal

and corner situations were about-

this weekend,” Collier said. “She’ll
be-doing a lot of blocking and hit-
ting for us.” ‘

Collier is confident about ‘his

team’s, performance." this weekend, -

but maintains a certain amount of
respect for the other squads in the
Eastern top four: Rutgers,
Georgetown, and Penn State.

even said Ludwig.-

“We were a bit worried about
playing Slippery Rock on their
home field,” said~Ludwig. “They
had previously lost by only one
point to Lock Haven, a nationally
ranked hockey team.”

The win to Slippery Rock puts
the Pantherettes closer to a chance
for a regional bid. If they can beat
Bucknell, Pitt could draw the bid in 1
order to go to the Mid-Atlantic
Regionals, Baltimore, Maryland, in
November. :

Majors took a 1-10 team and turned it immediately

' into a.winner. His 1973 team was 6-5-1 and the Pan- 1’
thers were winners for the first time in 10 years—and
losers in the Fiesta Bowl to Arizona State, 28-7. That
‘was Pitt's first bowl bid in 17 years. 1

In 1974 the Panthers went 7-4, and in 1975, 8-4.-

The 1975 team defeated Georgia and Notre Dame
and drubbed Kansas in the Sun Bowl, 38-19. Little
needs to be said about 1976 when Majors’- squad was
undefeated and won the national championship and
Sugar Bowl, defeating Georgia 27-3. It wasiafter that
season that Majors was called‘-home to Tennessee and

. In addition to turning a loser into a winner, Majors
generated the kind of support and enthusiasm for
Pitt football that no Panther football fan at the time
could even fathom. Not to take anything away from
Sherrill, but few of today’s Pitt enthusiasts would

fans on the day that it was announced that Michigan
had been defeated and Pitt would move up to
number one providing the Panthers defeated
Louisville that day. ‘

If everything was coming up roses in Pittsburgh
for Majors, then exactly why ‘did he leave?

“Part of it (the decision to leave) is going back to
where you were undefeated as ‘a senior,” Majors said
when his team was 11-0 and four weeks away from a
-national championship. “That was Tennessee’s last.
undefeated team, you know. It wasn’t a matter of
just going home, to be back in the south.

“My alma mater was going down, and the
challenge is there to see if I can do anything about it
with the strong pull of a while sta

Although he does have “the strong pull of a whole
state in on it,” Majors has done little since’ arriving in
Vol country. He has compiled a 16-17-1 record in his
first three years, and is 3-3 this season. Why hasn’t
he done the same to the Volunteerprogram that he
did to the Pitt program? -

Although tomorrow’s game is billed as a Jackie
Sherrill -versus Johnny Majors contest, it has come
down to much more than that for this university and
some of its bitter fans. Now, it’s Pitt versus Majors.

Majors, who is commonly referred to as the ar-
chitect of the modern Pitt football renaissance, has
probably as many detractors in Pittsburgh as he does

left Pittsburgh just after making a name for himself
and basked in that glory afterward;

seeing his old Pittsburgh buddies. He is not happy
with the progress of his team _thus far this season.

the feelings of Pitt fans than downright anger. Many
felt that had Majors stayed at‘Pitt, a repeat national

When Sherrill was placed into the job, a rebuilding of
sorts was necessary and it took two years to get the_
Panthers back up to a place among the nations  ‘
leaders. For Panther fans, two years is a long time.’ '
Majors doesn’t regret his decision to leave, but he
still visits Pittsburgh periodically.

jors said. “There have been timesnl second-guessed

Another things that he will have to live with is that
touch of resentment held by some Panther boosters
and that extra “Let’s Go Pitt” that he hears from the
