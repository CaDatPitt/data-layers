Report

issued  
O 10 years

after TMI

By Jeff Baker '

Associated Press Writer

Ten years after a presidential
commission recommended
abolishing the Nuclear Regulato-
ry Commission, the agency is-
sued an updated response
yesterday declaring nuclear reac-
tors safer than ever.

The report, prepared by the
NRC staff, reviews point by point
the recommendations contained
in the October 1979 report of a
presidential commission on the

, hree Mile lsland nuclear ac-
cident. ,

Seven months after the Penn-.
sylvania accident, the commis-
sion, led by computer scientist
John Kemeny, recommended
replacing the NRC with a more
efficient agency led by a single
administrator underthe executive
branch.

The panel said the state and

Qfederal emergency response to
-the TM! accident was disor-
ganized and called for increased
training of nuclear plant
operators. _

The NRC responded to the
panel's report in late -1979.
Kemeny required no later follow-
up, but NRC Chairman Lando
Zech requested it because, he

’ ”was interested in compiling a
report on what has been done in
the last 10 years in the areas cit-
ed,” NRC spokesman Joe
Fouchard said yesterday.

In a statement, Zech "cited

‘Q declines since 1979 in the num-
ber of emergency operating
”events” per reactor, in the num-
ber of unplanned plant shut-
downs and in the amount of
radiation exposure to plant per-
sonnel '

”Training, equipment "and
maintenance at our commercial
nuclear power plants have been
upgraded," Zech said. ”Emergen-
cy planning has been enhanced.

9Noteworthy progress has been
achieved in adding to the margin
of safety already in place in com-
mercial nuclear power reactors.”

The NRC said radiation ex-
posure, measured by ”man—rem,”
has dropped each year from 1984
through- 1987. Man’-rem is a
measure of radiation exposure for
large numbers of people. For ex-
ample, when 100 people receive

'6 an average exposure of 0.01 rem, ,/
that would result in a figure of 1
man-rem. ‘ - P s‘

Education addressed at annual Mann lecture  

By Tom Kubilius
For The Pitt News

Dr. Constance E.,Clayton.urged
that good schools in every neigh-
borhood cannot be ”just a story,
it must become a- reality.”

Clayton spoke at the,Univ‘ersi-
ty of Pittsbur-gh’s 30th annual
Horace Mann Lecture on
Monday.

Clayton, who has served as

Philadelphia superintendent of ._

schools since 1982, assured that _
we have the ability to make all of
our schools effective.

Students co

_By John Berger

Contributing Editor

College is a breeding ground
for stress, and there are very few
outlets available to students. Be-
tween busy class schedules, tur-
bulent social lives and stressful
job situations, many students find
themselves overwhelmed by
stress. In spite of schedulingtrour
bles, one place that tries to pro-
vide short—term help with these
problems is the University of

_ Pittsburgh Counseling Center.

The center has a staff of six psy-
chologists and four psychology
interns. The interns are’doctora|

’ candidates,» -and at .-thisdpoint,
i_ ”they have completed all of their

' ~'..

1 daily basis. -

Clayton's lecture was titled
”Contemporary Issues‘ in Urban
Education,” and called for more
involvement in education reform
by those who deal with ”teach—

T ing strategies and programs that

advance public education” on a

The lecture focused on four
”proposed realities” of our pub-
lic school system. These realities
call for schools to be more than
places of learning, for‘ .urban
schools to be restructured to meet
urban needs, and for actionto be

training, and this is the last step
before they get their degree,” ac-
cording to Dr. Robert Gallagher,
the director of the counseling
center.

”There are very high-quality

people coming into this pro-.

gram,” he continued. ”They

‘energize the center.”

Gallagher came to Pitt as a psy-
chologist for the center in. 1966,
and became the director in 1971.

Gallagher feels strongly about
the center's ability to help stu-
dents, but he is also aware of the
limitations entailed by the nature
of the center.

”For every studentlwe see. here

. atthe center, there are probably V
1 six__to :ei,ght_ who could ' ben‘ef.it.»_

 

 

‘tion that interferes with educa-
tion. Clayton's fourth reality was
that those who are in charge of
the current ”education ‘reform’
movement” should consult with
those who would be practicing

proposed reforms — the educa-‘
.tors and administrators of our

public schools.

The superintendent pointed out
that schools serve ' as social
centers and employers in ”neigh-

borhoods that have been desert- ~

ed by all, except those who

‘cannot leave.” She noted the
taken against government regu|a- "

necessity for these schools to be

mplain of Iongwaits for counseling-1.

, from some kind of intervention.

We obviously aren't staffed to
handle that many.  -Even now,
we're having difficulty keeping

. up with the press for services.”

The center is sufficiently busy
that a student could have to wait
three weeks for an appointment.

Onestudent, who specified
that she wanted to talk to a wom-
an counselor, was told that she
would have to wait two months

‘to see someone. When she

agreed to talk with a man, she still '
had a month-long wait before her

appointment. She said, ’’If they .

have that much of a problem,

they should get more coun-

selors.’g’ .

Channon denies he was lax in warning airlines

LONDON (AP) — Embattled
Transport- Secretary Paul Chan-
non went before a jeering Parlia-
ment yesterday and denied he
was lax in warning airlines of a
new type of terrorist bomb before
the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster.

Channon, often shouting above
calls for his resignation, said that
after the jumbo jet was blown
apart over Scotland on Dec. 21,
be concealed from Parliament for
security reasons the internation-

.al alert about a radio-cassette

bomb.

He also said that at the time, he
thought the disaster could have
been an accident.

”I told Parliament all I could,”
Channon said during a House of
Commons emergency debate,
forced by the opposition Labor
Party. ”In investigations where
there.are also important security
matters it is essential that all of us
exercise a certain degree of res-
traint.”

Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher rallied to Channon’s
defense, declaring that ”totally

unfair accusations have been
made against him by lesser

 

men.” ' _
But Channon, 54, appeared in-
creasingly defensive, and ‘there
was no sign his appearance in the
Commons, after five days of
refusing to make a parliamentary
statement, would ease the ons-

- laught.

NEWS BRIEFS

Critics accuse him of muddled
and cavalier conduct, of bungling
the warnings from West German
and U.S. authorities, and of con-
cealing information until it is
forced out.

Pa. now prepared in
case of emergencies

HARRISBURG (AP) - In the 10
years since the accident at Three
Mile Island, when emergency
preparedness was exposed as
woefully inadequate, the state
has moved from the blackboard
to the computer in an effort to
prepare for similar emergencies,

. officials said yesterday.

During a briefing with report-
ers, Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, who
chairs the Pennsylvania Emergen-
cy Management Agency, said the
state learned hard lessons during
the March 1979 accident at TMI
and had made changes to address
deficiencies.

Speaking in the computerized
emergency center located in the
basement of the state's transpor-
tation building, Singel said black-
boards once stood where
overhead video screens now
glimmer.

Trial continues for
2nd-largest U.S.

heist

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) --
Five men charged in the $7.1 mil-

lion Wells Fargo robbery didn't A

commit the heist itself but were
part of a network that planried the
crime and spirited the money to
a violent Puerto Rican nationalist
group, a prosecutor told jurors
yesterday.

In closing arguments of the
five-month trial, Assistant U.S. At-

torney Carmen Espinosa Van Kirk
said the government had proved
that the key defendant planned
the theft and helped Wells Fargo
guard Victor M. Gerena, who
stole the money from a compa-
ny depot, flee the country.

The five men have been on tri-
al since Oct. 1 1 on charges stem-
ming from the Sept. 12, 1983
robbery of the Wells Fargo depot
in West Hartford, the second-
largest cash heist in U.S. history.

Man convicted of

ERIE, Pa. (AP) ~ A jury yester-

operator of first-degree murder in
the June 1988 kidnapping and
shooting death of a banker's wife.

The jury returned its verdict
against David C. Copenhefer, 42,

‘shortly before 5 p.m. after

deliberating all day. In addition
to murder, Copenhefer was con-
victed of kidnapping, attempted

extortion, attempted robbery, ter- .

roristic threats and unlawful res-
traint.

8 Campus bus extends route through Oakland

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

/\

The campus bus travels along on its newly extended route.

 

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

The campus bus has extended
its evening route farther into

 . northeast Oakland in an attempt

to "provide Pitt students with a
little more security after dark,”
according to Janet Thomas, Pitt's
assistant director of Public Safety.

”The changes, we hope, will
take students closer to their des-
tinations,” she said. A
~ The route changes have al-
ready been in effect for several
weeks and, Thomas said, the
campus bus has had no problem
in maintaining the same time
schedule that was in use prior to
the extension.

Beginning at 7 p.m. each even-
ing, the campus bus follows Ba-

' yard Street past the I<appa Kappa

Gamma sorority house. It turns
left from Bayard onto North
Neville Street and then makes

another left onto Centre Avenue

near Giant Eagle supermarket. It
then follows Centre to the Schen-
ley High School, where it con-
tinues its day route up the hill

toward the fraternities and Trees '

Hall.

Thomas drafted the route
changes in response to the re-
quests of SGB member Harper
Watters, one North Oakland resi-

new route.

"The student population of
North Oakland is comparable to
that of South Oakland,” Watters
said. ”South Oakland receives
extensive bus service. I thought
it was about time for North Oak-
land to receive comparable
service.” A

Thomas said Laidlaw corpora-
tion, the company from which
the university leases the campus g.
bus, was ”very cooperative” in
complying with the" route
changes.

But a different measure, using
the number of workers exposed
to a measurable dose of radiation,
shows an increase, according to
Washington attorney Joanne
Doroshow.

Doroshow, citing figures com-
piled by Ralph Nader’s Public
Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
Project, said in a recent report
that a record 104,458 workers
were exposed to radiation from
commercial reactors in 1987. In
1984, the figure totaled 98,162,
the report said.

THE PITT NEWS, ‘Wednesday, March 22, 1989

said, ”there is no reason for any-
one to expect to have health ef-
fects due to the Unit 2 accident.
Radiation levels simply were not
high enough to cause likely
effects."

The Aamodts said they will be-
gin this week to mail question-
naires to 10 major metropolitan
newspapers which had between
six and 10 staff members on the
accident scene.

Public Citizen also said nearly
3,000 ”mishaps” and 430 emer-
gency shutdowns occurred at
U.S. plants in 1987.

The NRC’s figures show a
marked decrease in problems. In
1985, operating reactors report-
ed on the average 2.4 ”si_gnificant
operating events,” or major
problems. In 1987, the figure
dropped to 0.8. As of today, 108
nuclear reactors are operating in

In 1984, the NRC said, plants

Study to examine journalists’ deaths by cancer after T/\/IIQ

ganizing and interpreting the
results by the Committee of
Health Aspects and Management
of Nuclear Power.

A 1984 health study by the
Aamodts asserted a cancer death
rate 500 percent higher than ex-
pected between 1980 and 1984
in three York County neighbor-
hoods downwind of the plant
where residents reported sym-
ptoms of radiation sickness.

O

was 3.24.

Since the accident, the NRC
has established emergency plan-
ning requirements for all reactors.

”State and local authorities
have upgraded emergency plans,
equipment and training, and par-
ticipate with licensees in bienni-

al response exercises,” Tuesday's _ _
NRC report said. 0

But emergency planning re-
mains controversial.

Massachusettsofficials refused
to participate in emergency plan-
ning for the Seabrook nuclear
plant, saying evacuating coastal

towns near the plant would bee

impossible. .

In lieu of the refusal, the NRC
has given approval for plant oper-
ators to _file emergency plans as
Seabrook pursues a Iow—pOwer
operating license.

In response to the Kemeny
panel's criticism of NRC organi-
zation and management, Tues-

_day’s report said the agency hﬁe

consolidated its staff in a single.-
building in Rockville, Md., and

has established a separate office

THE PlTT NEWS, Wednesday, March 22, T989

By Barry Renfrew

Associated Press Writer

WONJU, South Korea (AP) —
Some of the U.S. soldiers taking
part in annual ”Team Spirit” ex-
ercises with South Korean forces
are puzzled and angry about
growing anti—American protests in
a nation they are helping to
defend.

The exercises involving
200,000 South Korean and U.S.
troops are becoming increasing-
ly controversial as South Korean
radicals demand an end to the
U.S. military presence in their
country. Opinion polls indicate
many ordinary South Koreans
have growing reservations about
it.

”Many young American soldi-
ers think the same as the Koreans
— they don't want us here and
we don't want to be here,” said

0 an officer, who declined to be

named. ”They want to go home.”
. Some U.S. officers and soldiers
say anti-Americanism is creating
morale problems, and some don't
want to serve in South Korea be-

cause they don't feel welcome.
They ask why the United States
makes a massive defense com-
mitment to a nation where pro-
testers regularly attack U.S.
government facilities and stage
violent anti-American protests.

A U.S. officer who asked not to
be identified said radical students
hurled firebombs at an American
unit during the exercises around
Wonju. The bombs caused no
damage and the protesters fled in
a car, he said. ’

’’It left a funny feeling,” he
said.

South Korean and U.S. officials
insist anti—Americanism is a minor
problem confined to a radical
fringe, and that relations between
the two nations remain as close
as ever. But U.S. soldiers, who
are told to avoid wearing uni-
forms on the streets so as not to
offend Koreans, don't agree.

”The command position is that
anti-Americanism is a minority
view, and the command doesn't
want to hear anyone publicly op-
posing that position,” a U.S. Air
Force officer said in an interview.

”The command keeps saying, in

That's not working. Anti-

”Team Spirit,” the second-
largest exercisestaged by U.S.
forces, is a symbol of American
commitment to South Korea. Ev-

Counsel

Continued from page 1

In addition to the above-
mentioned psychological staff,
the center also receives eight
hours of consultation from psy-
chiatrists. While psychologists act
as counselors, psychiatrists are
licensed medical doctors with the
ability to prescribe medication
and hospitalization.

For a student to see a psy-
chiatrist at the center, he or she
must either be referred through a
Pitt counselor or an outside psy-

chologist. The psychiatrists’ time
is divided between three doctors,
some of whom are on the staff of
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic.

Gallagher explained that from
a survey circulated to patrons of
the center once a year, it was de-
termined that ”Between 75 [per-
cent] and 80 percent of the
students indicated that they had
received a sign_ificant amount of
help here.

ed States treats their nation as an
unimportant satellite despite its
enormous economic growth and
emergence as an Asian power.

The resentment aimed at U.S.
forces is a stunning reversal after
years of gratitude for the Ameri-
can military intervention in 1950
that saved the south from a com-
munist invasion by North Korea.
U.S. forces remained after the

_Korean War and 43,000 are

based in the south.

U.S. and South Korean leaders
insist the American military
presence is vital to protect the
south from North Korea, which
has staged intermittent attacks
against the south. On a February
visit to Seoul, President Bush said
American forces have kept the
south free and will remain as long
as they are wanted.

An extra 30,000 U.S. troops,
including National Guard, Navy

and Air Force units, are flown in
during ”Team Spirit” to practice
bringing in U.S. reinforcements
in the event of a North Korean
attack.

Maj. Bud Bowles of the Hawaii
National Guard said some mem-

bers of his unit were worried

about coming to South Korea be-
cause of the anti-Americanism.
Soldiers were warned to be care-
ful in towns and to travel‘ in
groups, he said. ‘

Management mishap

In the recent dispute that led to the resignation of
university Provost Rudolph Weingartner, there emerges
one, and only one, very clear fact.

Either Weingartner or President Wesley Posvar has
a very distorted view of what actually happened be—
tween the two of them. This leads to some rather alarm-

ing views concerning what is going on in the higher

echelons of the University of Pittsburgh.

According to Posvar, Weingartner asked for ”exten—
sions of his own jurisdiction  [and] a further and for-
mal delegation and sharing of the authority vested in
president, including budget authority in areas outside
his purview.”

Accodring to Weingartner, he expressed to Posvar that
he wanted to ”participate in the formulation of the budg-
et of the entire university — making it clear [he] meant
participation and not determination.” Apparently, all
he asked for was the opportunity to have more input

into the budgetary process, so that he could ”argue the’

case for an allocation to academic functions versus an
allocation for another purpose.”

Who is in the right here?

Actually, it doesn't matter.

come up with such radically different views on a sin-
gle situation and display such a complete lack of com-

The acknowledgement by
South Africa's dominant Dutch
Reform Church that apartheid is
a “sin” for which there is no bib-
lical justification and its plea for
”forgiveness” for its part in creat-
ing and maintaining the system of
racial separation may be the first
important step on that country's
long road to redemption.

Because 80 percent of the cur-
rent government leadership in
South Africa belongs to the racial-
ly divided 3.3 million member
church, the confession by the
church leadership may go further
than the world's ostracism and
economic sanctions toward creat-
ing a nation of racial harmony
and avoiding a violent revolution
that would deliver the country
into the hands of the far left.

The response by the church's
non-white branches was as im-
portant as the confessionlby the

white branch: ”We, too, confess

did it, too. We did it over this past

I watched Ihe Wizard of Oz.
Yeah, and I liked it. Sort of. I

do I get to watch a sweet ”little

was that this time it wasn't only
for entertainment. See, I think I fi-

The penal system in America,

The flaws mainly stem from two

Lately, conservative politicians

view; they want to get tough on
crime, particularly drug-related,
and show criminals that crime
doesn't pay. Getting tough,
however good an idea it is, is
creating a problem that was not

ed to show miscreants that their

wouldn't be tolerated, the exact

Q opposite of what was expected to

happen happened '— criminals

course, it is clear that this hope
is only for people who live up to
the image of the people already
there. This image, it seems to me,
is one of wealth (after all, the city

The county jail in Pittsburgh is
such an example. The federally

met on a daily basis, so the only
way to house new inmates is to

"weapon.” Martial firearms have
always been the most rugged and
reliable designs. That is why mil-
lions of Americans own semiau-
tomatic firearms, not to lay waste
to our neighbors

Which brings me to my final
point. Do you have any idea how
many of those "assault weapons”
that have been banned from im-

portation have been used to kill ’

people? According to a recently

' completed study by the Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
less than I percent of the
44,000-odd guns have been used
in murders. This is from 1985, the
first year of importation on a wide
scale, through 1988. If, as you
say, these firearms are the choice
of ”drug dealers, other criminals
and sociopaths," why is this
number so low? Much lower, in

fact, than the percentage of cars ‘

good people.

The Wizard, the great, power-
ful one, represents politicians. He
was the all-knowing, all-powerful
one, who could control the fates
of the ’’little’’ people, but nobody
could ever see him. He was way
above their level. But, "behind
the curtain,” he wasjust a man,
a fake. We have to assume that
he was educated‘, but that
definitely doesn't qualify him to
be a wizard. I guess it reminds me
of certain people whose qualifi-
cations are questionable, but who
are still elected to office.

One thing I can say that I loved
about this children's movie is
how the flying monkeys so
graphically tore apart the
scarecrow, limb from limb, chest
and all. I was relieved. I'm not
used to- watching television
without violence. The witch set-
ting the scarecrow on fire made
it even better. At least the wicked
witch didn't make good on her
threat to Dorothy — the soldiers
getting crushed by the chandelier

- and the two witches dying was

there. This problem resulted in
the federal government ordering
Allegheny County to build

another jail, one which willbe‘

filled to the limit on the day it
opens

"Get tough” governments
across the country have found
themselves inventing new ways

to punish criminals that do little,

if anything, to deter crime.
Weekend furlough programs and
the practice of making a criminal
spend a week in jail and a week
at home are just two pitiful*’exam—
ples of how even the most violent
criminals are able to get back on
the streets. The most recent brain-
storm of idiocy is tohave crimi-
nals confined to their homes with
small electronic beepers attached
to their ankles or wrists so that

corrections officers can monitor S

their movements in a manner
similar to the game commission
monitoring tagged geese and

Another failure in the grand

involved in fatal crashes. Yet I
hear no one calling for a ban on
Chevys, Hondas and BMWS.

probably enough for most
5-year-olds. T

The end of the movie had to be
the most heartwrenching scene
ever filmed. When Dorothy was
saying goodbye to her friends, I
had tears in my eyes. Didn't
everyone? I just couldn't under-
stand why anyone would want to
leave that magical, wonderful
place to go back to Kansas. It's
not like she was never there; she
knew what she was in for.

El ' El Cl

In all honesty, I must say that
I actually did enjoy this movie.
But unlike most people who
probably liked Dorothy the most,
I liked the scarecrow. He was
definitely the coolest. The best
line i.n the whole movie was at
the beginning when Dorothy
asked him how he could talk if he
didn't have a brain. He said,
”Some people without brains do
an awful lot of talking, don't
they?” It was classic. I only wish
it weren't so true.

I guess the biggest disappoint-
ment-for me was when Dorothy

clicked her heels and said,
”There’s no place like home.” It
has lost its magic for me. For
those of you who have been‘
drunk, tried this coming out of a‘
bar, and found that it didn't work,
there's no need to worry. Two
good things did come out of it,
though: It did work for Dorothy,
and everyone on Forbes Avenue
got a good laugh. _ - -

Pat Santoro won his second consecutive NCAA 142-pound championship last weekend.

Pete Rose should be the least of
Ueberroth’s, Giamatti 5 concerns

Well, major league baseball
has put one of its own under the
microscope. Pete Rose, one of
the greatest players to ever play
the game, is being investigated
for ”outside interests.”

T in this day and age, everybody

‘ is doing something that he would

rather not let anybody else know

about. Although the commission-\
er’s office isn't coming right out

and saying it, the belief is that
Rose is being investigated for
gambling.

Rose has come out and said
that he did bet on such things as
horse and dog races. It is also ru-
mored that Rose took part in a
Pick Six ticket worth $265,669 at
Turfway Park in Florence, Ky.

Rose has denied this part of the '

allegation.

He is being put under the
microscope unjustly. Nobody has
ever said that Rose placed bets on
baseball games. That was not part
of Commisioner Peter Ueberroth
and Commisioner-elect A. Bart-

lett Giamatti’s statement.

In fact, all the statement said
was that the office is investigating
”serious allegations involving Mr.
Pete Rose.”

Reports say that Rose voluntar-
ily told of the gambling.

My question is, so what?

VINCE
CAREY

— Gambling has been something
that, through the ages, baseball
players have done to relax. Babe
Ruth used to go to the tracks, and
he didn't bring down the game.

What it seems like is that the
commissioner is overreacting to
the whole situation. Those in
charge probably think that_be-
cause Rose is around the gam-
bling environment, that he will
turn into baseball's version of Art
Schlicter (the Ohio State and Bal-

timore Coltsiquarterback who lost ~

millions gambling and al|egede-
ly threw games to recoup his
losses).

I don't think that Rose is that
stupid. He obviously loves the
game of baseball, or else he
wouldn't stay around in it. Why
would he do something that will
taint his career, possibly keep

‘him out of the Hall ‘of Fame and

get him tossed out of his job as
Cincinnati Reds manager?

If Rose had been placing bets
on baseball games, that would be

a different story. But he's not, so_

there is no real harm being done.
Rose likes to watch the ponies,
but that is in no way going to hurt
the integrity of the ball game.
. The commissioner's office is
doing far worse damage by mak-
ing these idiotic allegations. By
taking this Rose thing up, they are
ignoring th_e far more important
problems facing baseball.

Second time around
sweeter for Santoro

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

Four-time All-American, two-

time national champion, the only
Pitt wrestler to win over 100
matches, and an athlete with a su-
perior work ethic.
_ Senior Pitt wrestler Pat Santoro
recently ended his collegiate
career in a manner which would
seem to be only fitting to match
the above description.

Santoro captured his second
consecutive national champion-
ship this past Saturday in Oklaho-
ma City as he defeated Arizona
State’s Junior Saunders in
overtime.-

He became the first Pitt wres-
tler to capture multiple national
titles since 1957, when Ed Peery
won three in a row.

Santoro’s accomplishments as
a Panther:

0 One of only three Pitt wres-
tlers to capture multiple national
titles.

0 First Pitt wrestler since 1957
to hold multiple national titles.

0 Only wrestler in Pitt history
to win over 100 matches (165-10
lifetime, a .942 winning per-
centage).

0 Has more NCAA tournament
matches to his name than any
other Eastern Wrestling League
competitor.

0 Boasts a .833 winning per-
centage in tournaments, with a
20-4 record.

«.

Pitt wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer was not surprised at
his top wrestler’s most recent ac-
complishment, but ac-
knowledged how great a feat a
second national title really is.-

”Pat did an unbelievable job.
The pressure was phenomenal
and the second title is the tough-
est,” Stottlemyer said.‘ i

”142 [pounds] is always a
talented weight class, and Pat’s
been on top of it for the past cou-
ple of years.”

Saunders was an unexpected
opponent in the finals, as most
expected to see Santoro take on
Clarion University's Mike Cole.

Cole defeated Santoro three
times during the 1988-1989 sea-
son, and everyone was looking
forward to a grudge match in the
‘NCAA finals.

Cole was upset by Saunders in
the semifinals, but Stottlemyer
was not surprised.

”Cole is more susceptible to
losing before the finals than Pat
is,” Stottlemyer said.

”Saun_ders was having a great
tournament and looked tough.
He wrestled well against Cole,
and he's a talented kid.

”Anytime you get to the NCAA
finals, you’re a force to be reck-
oned with nomatter who your
opponent is.”-

Santoro, a normally aggressive
wrestler, paced himself against

’ Saunders and wrestled -defensive-

ly. The score ended up at 6-6,
1-1, criteria 10, with Santoro win-
ning due to a riding time ad-
vantage.

Sean O’Day of Edinboro-

University, whom Santoro defeat-
ed for last year's championship,

dropped down to 134. Most sus-

pected that he was ducking San-
toro in fear of a repeat defeat.

Turns out that's exactly what he
was doing. ~

-”The kid wanted to win a na-

tional title and he figured his best
shot would be at 134,” Stott-
lemyer said. ' '

”There are no Pat Santoros at
134,” he noted. '

Woods feared physical harm

By Mario Fox
Associated Press Writer

CHICAGO — Tony Woods, a
former University of Pittsburgh
linebacker, testified Tuesday that
he felt threatened by Norby
Walters because of comments the
sports agent made after Woods
fired him.

A tape recording of a conver-
sation between the two was
played at the agent’s federal court
trial, and Walters was heard say-
ing he didn’t want ”to be a rat”
and cause problems over being
replaced by another agent.

The recording of their 1987
conversation was made by
Woods, now with the Seattle Sea-
hawks, after he was sued for
$500,000 by Walters for breaking
their contract.

Walters, 58, and co—defendant
Lloyd Bloom, 29, are charged
with racketeering, fraud and ex-
tortion. ~

Woods said he signed .a con-
tract with Walters and Bloom in
February 1986, when he was a
junior at Pitt. He testified he ac-
cepted about $10,000 in loans
from the agents, plus plane tick-
ets for himself and his younger
brother, also a Pitt football player.

NCAA rules forbid an athlete to
sign with an agent or accept any
payments until after the final year
of col_lege eligibility is completed.

Walters also lent $6,000 to
Woods’ parents, who own a
house—cleaning business in South
Orange, NJ.

in December 1986, Woods
fired Walters and Bloom and
hired agent Bruce Allen of Phoe-
nix to represent him in NFL
negotiations, prompting Walters’
filing of a $500,000 breach—of—
contract lawsuit against the line-
backer

”l was hearing a lot during the
course of the season,” Woods
said in explaining his decision to
fire the pair, adding that unsavory
rumors about organized crime in-
volvement and drugs made him
want to distance himself.

Walters called to complain that
when Woods let him go, six other
football players followed suit.

“Never once did I act like a
cutie pie, a big shot, a wise guy.
Then you drop the bomb,”
Walters said in the tape—recorded
conversation played in U.S. Dis-
trict Court.

”l__don’t want to be a rat, cre-
ate problems for Pittsburgh, cre-
ate problems for the Woods
family,” the agent said.-

Walters told Woods in the con-
versation to fire agent Allen im-
mediately and return to World
Sports and Entertainment of New
York, run by Walters and Bloom.

major league law battle with Nor-
by Walters,” Walters advised.

Woods said he interpreted
Walters’ comments as threats to
make financial trouble for him
and his parents, and to see to it
that the NCAA put Pitt on proba-
tion and stripped his brother of
his college football eligibility.

The linebacker admitted under
cross—examination that he hadn't
paid back a cent of the money
lent to him by the sports agents,
despite a $350,000 signing bonus
from Seattle in 1987.

Defense lawyer Dan K. Webb
said checks sent by Woods’ par-
ents to repay their loan from
Walters bounced due to insuffi-
cient funds.

The government claims the
agents defrauded seven universi-
ties by signing student athletes to
professional representation con-
tracts before their eligibility had
expired.

Walters and Bloom also are ac-
cused of using cash to persuade
the athletes to sign, and of
threatening players with physical
harm if they tried to back out of
the deals.

Defense attorneys have coun-
tered by arguing that the agents
were the victims of money-
hungry athletes, and have at-
tempted to put the collegiate ath-
letic system on trial.

NoCindere||a teams left in the o
NCAA tournament's Final 16

By john Nelson

AP Sports Writer

Now there are 16, and the
NCAA basketball tournament is
running true to form. Of the
teams left, only two were un-
ranked in the final Associated
Press poll, and all but three come
from the four most powerful con-
ferences in the country.

”At this stage of the tourna-
ment, everybody has shown they
can play. ...” Indiana Coach Bob
Knight said. ”We’ve lasted. longer
than 48 of them. We've got 16
left, and at this point, anybody
has a chance.”

The first round left hope for
only a few upstarts — like Siena,
Evansville and Middle Tennessee
State — and round two disposed
of them.

When the four. regional semifi-
nals begin Thursday, Virginia and
Minnesota will be the only un-
ranked teams playing. And
neither of them can be consi-
dered a so-called ”Cinderella”
team.

The regional semifinals in the
Southeast and West will be
played Thursday night.

dle Tennessee State.

Middle Tennessee Coach
Bruce Stewart called Virginia's
guards — Richard Morgan and
John Crotty —- two of the best in
the nation.

”They’re the two best shooting
guards we've faced in [the] f_ive
years I've been at Middle Tennes-

North Carolina beat UCLA in
the second round despite not

Knight will be going for his

Indiana against a supremely con-
fident Seton Hall "team.

”We’re good and we know it,”
Seton Hall Coach P.I. Carlesimo
said. ”We think we're as good as
anybody in the tournament.

That's not to be arrogant. You
have to prove it, but we felt we
could make it to Denver.”

In the second round, Indiana
beat Texas-El Paso despite having
three starters in foul trouble, and
the Hoosiers did it from the
perimeter.

The other West semifinal has‘

the two best teams in the West:
Arizona and Nevada-Las Vegas.

East V

The Georgetown—N.C. State
game will match two of the coun-
try’s finest guards —- the Wolf-
pack’s Rodney Monroe and the
Hoyas’ Charles Smith. Both had
a great deal to do with their teams
getting to the Final 16.

Monroe scored 40 points, in-
cluding 11 in the second over-
time, and hit jumpers that forced
both extra periods as N.C. State
beat Iowa 102-96 in Sunday's
best game.

Smith had 28 of his 34 points
in the second half as Georgetown
had to rally for the second time
in the tournament, beating Notre
Dame by seven.

”It’s obvious that- as Smith
goes, they go,” Notre Dame
coach Digger Phelps ’ said of
Georgetown. ”He took charge
when it counted-.” ‘

Midwest

Nolan Richardson, whose Ar-
kansas Razorbacks lost to Louis-
ville in the second round, said the
Cardinals will have a tough time

with ‘Illinois in the semifinals‘. .

”Il|inois is a dream—type,team
for this era,” he said. ”They’re-all
the same size and they can all
run,_jump, shoot and put the ball

on the floor. They can go all the ‘

way.’’ .

That suits Louisville Coach

Denny Crum ‘just fine.

”The pressure’s on the team
that's No.1,” Crum said. ”There’s
no pressure on us. It's a good spot

‘to be in.”

Like Michigan, Missouri is in
the Final 16'with an interim
coach. Rich Daly, an assistant
who specialized in recruiting,
took over for Norm Stewart when

International competition a possibility for NFL  

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer

PALM DESERT, Calif. —— Com-
missioner Pete Rozelle said Mon-
day it's possible the NFL’s new
international minor league, with
teams based in Europe and North
America, could start to play as
early as next year.

Rozelle did not include plans
for the new international league
in his opening talk to the owners
at the NFL meetings and said few
concrete plans had been made
beyond a new marketing effort

andllive televised (games) in En-
gland this year. In the talk, he told
the owners to remain upbeat
about league matters.

But he emerged from the meet-
ing toa series of questions about
the plans.

"It's possible that we could be-
gin as soon as next spring,” he
said. "Probab|e, I don't know.”

The NFL has discussed interna-
tional play since 1974.

But not until the past four years,
when a series of exhibition games
in London whetted the appetite
of British fans for American foot-

ball, has going overseas become
likely. It became even more like-
ly after NBC became interested in
televising a spring minor league,
and Rozelle broached that
proposal at a meeting three
weeks ago of the NFL’s long-
range planning and finance com-
mittees at New Orleans.
Monday's early session was
devoted to Rozelle’s state-of-the-
league address and some rules
recommendations from the Com-
petition Committee. The owners
did make one vote — rejecting a
proposal made by the Pittsburgh

Leadership of Hillman and talent
of Edwards spark Knight's Hoosiers

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The
leadership ofJoe Hillman and the
unselfish talent of Jay Edwards
have been the keys to a success-
ful Indiana basketball season,
Coach Bob Knight says.

Knight, named coach of the
year Tuesday by the Big Ten Con-
ference, is preparing his Hoosiers
to play Seton Hall Thursday in
the semifinals of the NCAA Tour-

. nament’s West Regional.’

He traces the makings of Indi-
ana's conference championship
back to last spring, just before
Hillman left Bloomington to join
the Medford A's Class A baseball
team for. the summer. -

"I broughtjoe in and said, 'Tell
me about Edwards,’ " Knight
recalled. ”He said, ‘Edwards is
the best guy to play basketball
with I've ever played with. You
miss a shot,.’Edwards is the first
guy to say, ‘Joe, keep shooting.’

"I may already have told Joe to
quit shooting but Edwards tells

him to keep shooting, and Joe
likes that. Joe said, ‘You're open,
he gets you the ball, he rebounds.
Ifwe could just get him to go full
tilt all the time.’ But I've come to
believe he goes full tilt a lot more
than you’d think because he's an
effortless player.

”With Joe's ability to lead and
the feeling the kids have for the
kind of player Edwards is and the
things he can do, we just have a
much stronger team psychologi-
cally [and] mentally than ‘a year
ago. I don't think it has a single
thing to do with what I've done."

ATTENTION UNDERGRADUATES!!! -

 

In first— and second-round
NCAA Tournament games in
Tucson, the second-seeded Hoos-
iers shot .555 from the field, limit-
ed George Mason and Texas-El
Paso to .445 shooting, outscored
them 47-27 at the foul line, out-
rebounded them 78-57, and
forced 30 turnovers.

Seton Hall, 28-6, is next for In-
diana, 27-7. Top-seeded Arizona,
29-3, plays Nevada-Las Vegas,
27-7, in the other semifinal. The
winners meet Saturday for a trip
to the Final Four in Seattle.

The owners also were waiting
for more information before vot-
ing on the sale of the Dallas Cow-
boys to Arkansas oilman Jerry
Jones, who already has installed
the University of Miami's Jimmy
Johnson as his coach.

But Rozelle stressed that the

sale was as good as approved.
"It's just a matter of time,” he
said. "Everything looks positive.
We just need a few papers."
As for the topic of the new
minor league, it came amid
almost a carnival atmosphere
created by the lobbying of eight
cities for expansion franchises,
even though Rozelle has empha-
sized that expansion won't be
considered until there is a new

it for years.

But the international league
isn't likely to be delayed too long,
even though plans are imprecise.

Rozelle said it probably would
involve between 10 and 12
teams, evenly divided between
Europe and North America, or, as
Rozelle put it,"the old world and
new world."

He gave no specific sites, but
named London and Frankfurt,
West Germany, as likely Europe-
an locales and said American ci- .
ties seeking expansion teams also
would ‘be possibilities’.

9 Andre Agassi upset by

unheralded Steeb

”He started to hit the ball
too hard and stayed very close
to the baseline,” said Steeb.
”After he realized I can keep
up with him, he started trying
to hit winners from there, and
that makes him a little bit
shaky/’

Agassi had only eight fore-
hand winners to 18 for the left-
handed Steeb, and just two
aces to six for the West Ger-
man. Agassi, who lost eight of
his 14 service games, said his
heart was not in the tour-
nament.

By Steven Wine
AP Sports Writer

KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.
Third—seeded Andre Agassi
was upset by West German
Carl-Uwe Steeb 6-4, 7-5, 6-0
in the first round of the Inter-
national Players Champion-
ship Tuesday, and became the
tournament's first major
casualty.

Agassi said he had never
heard of the 21-year-old West
German.

’’I had no idea whether he
was left—handed or right-

I handed or anything,” he
said.”I didn't know his name.”

Steeb responded: ”Maybe
he knows it now.”

Agassi was the first of the
top 16 seeds to lose in the two-
week, $2.1 million tourna-
ment. Winners Tuesday in-
cluded No.1 seeds Ivan Lendl
and Gabriela Sabatini.

Steeb, ranked 96th, is best
known for beating Mats
Wilar-Ider in last year's Davis
Cup finals. Steeb’s blistering
forehand and big serve were
the difference against Agassi,
who lost the final eight games.

Lendl improved his record
this year on hard courts to-
13-0 by beating Todd Wood-
bridge of Australia 6-2, 6-2,
6-3. ‘

Sabatini beat Elly Hakami of
Tiburon, Calif., 6-O, 6-3.’No.3
Helena Sukova needed only
46 minutes to oust Sophie
Amiach of France, 6-1, 6-1.

No.7 Barbara Potter pulled
out because of back spasms.
Potter has withdrawn from
four tournaments this year be-
cause of injuries.

on the sideline until the con-
clusion of the NCAA tour-
nament. -

It's been a whirlwind year
for the veteran coach, with the
disappointing loss to the
Soviet Union in the Olympics,
his much-ballyhooed protest
against Proposition 42, the
Hoyas’ rise to No.2 in the na-
tional rankings and now, a
berth in the tournament's
”sweet 16.” Undaunted by
the hectic pace, Thompson
credits his altruistic players for
. helping keep him fresh.

‘ ’’I’m tired in one sense, but
I'm OK,” he said. ”It would

have been more of a problem

if this team had to deal with a
lot of on- and off-the-court
problems. But this has not
been such a team.”

Indeed, this year's edition of
the Hoyas have turned out to
be an ideal blend of youth and
experience. First-year players
Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe
Mutombo and John Turner
have meshed with seniors
Charles Smith, Jaren Jackson
and Bobby Winston to form a
squad that is eager to learn,
anxious to win and, .most of
all, willing to heed’ their
coach's every whim.

”These people have been
sensible,” Thompson said.-
”You get tired based upon

your reaction to the team. If I
was dealing with a bunch of
pain in the necks, I'd have had
problems.

”You get tired real quick
when you have to worry about
things other than basketball,”
Thompson added. ”lt’s not just
winning, either. I've had some
teams that haven't won and
still weren't a problem.”

Thompson thought about
taking a vacation early in the
season, leaving control of the
team to assistant coaches Craig
Esherick and Mike Riley, who
ended up working in his place
when he boycotted two games
over Proposition 42.

Rose could join a long line of

gamblers disciplined by league a

By John Nelson

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK —- If Pete Rose gets
into trouble for ‘gambling, he
won't be the first baseball man to
run afoul of the commissioner's
office for casting his lot in the
wrong direction.

While policies may change
with time, baseball's concern
with the--effects of gambling on
the game dates back to the 1919
Black Sox scandal, when the
Chicago White Sox threw the
World Series to the Cincinnati
Reds. ’

Now, Cincinnati's manager is
under investigation by Commis-
sioner Peter Ueberroth’s office for
”serious allegations” that could,
according to a source, result in
his suspension. Although the
commissioner won't say what the-
allegations are against Rose, they

reportedly have to do with
gambling.

And although the exact nature
of any transgression is not
known, Rose is known to be an
avid horse player, reportedly also
likes to bet on college basketball
games and may have owed sub-
stantial gambling debts.

While horse playing is not
against the ‘rules of baseball, com-
missioners have imposed various
penalties for other forms of gam-

bling and for associating with
known gamblers. -

Baseball's only written guide-
line on gambling is section 21 (d)
of the Major League Rules which

prohibits betting on baseball,

games. Other forms of betting
may not be specificallyiagainst
the rules of baseball, but if the
wagers are made with bookies,
they may be against the law.

”Of course, you understand the
commissioner has broad powers
to act in the best interests of the
game,” said Rich Levin, a spokes-
man for the commissioner.

The absolute low point for
baseball was the result of gam-
bling. In 1919, several Chicago
White Sox players schemed to fix
the World Series. Commissioner
Kenesaw Mountain Landis issued
lifetime bans against Buck
Weaver, Ed Cicotte, Fred
McMullen, Happy Felsch and
Shoeless Joe Jackson, although
criminal charges were never
proven.

As the game's shady image fi-
nally began to improve in 1922,
pitcher Phil Douglas of the New

York Giants was banned for life -

for his alleged involvement in
gambling.

The game got a rest from gam-
bling scandals for 25 years before
Commissioner Happy Chandler
suspended Brooklyn Dodgers
manager Leo Durocher for the
1947 season for ”incidents
detrimental to baseball” — name-
ly, his association with known
gamblers. '

”For a long time I had ques-
tioned him,” Chandler said. He
said he spoke with Dodgers
general manager Branch Rickey,
and ”I said to Mr. Rickey, ’He’s
your man, you see to it that he’s
straightened out.’

”Finally I said to Rickey, let me
handle it. I almost made a good
boy out of him.”

It was more _than 20 years be-
fore another major baseball figure
was involved in. a gambling
scandal.

In 1970, Commissioner Bowie

Kuhn twice suspended Detroit '
Tigers pitcher Denny McLain, the ,

major league's last 30—game win-
ner, for associating with gam-
blers. McLain later was convicted
of various charges including rack-
eteering,
loan sharking and gambling, and
served 29 months in prison. .
Nine years later, Kuhn

banished Hall of'Famer Willie‘

Mays from the game because
Mayswent to work for an Atlan-
tic City gambling casino. Four
years later, Kuhn barred another
Hall of Famer, Mickey Mantle,
from associating with baseball
because he, too, had accepted a
$100,000—a—year public relations
job in Atlantic City.

Neither was heavily involved

cocaine possession, _

with baseball at the time — Mays 2‘ T

was an honorary coach of the
New York Mets, and Mantle a
spring training batting instructor

. with the New York Yankees —.

but the message was there: Gam-
bling once nearly ruined the
game. It would not do so again.

Kuhn never hinted, in fact did
not believe, that either Mantle or
Mays was involved in anything
underhanded or illegal. It was just
that baseball’ and gambling
should not be connected in any
way, Kuhn said.
