Oakland Bouncers
Do More Than Card

2ByMARKCELENDER

What do you call someone who
stands at the entrance of a bar and
gets paid between $15 and $20 a
night, along with all the liquor they
can handle, long as they check for 21
or older ID and, more times than
not, collect a cover charge frotn the
patrons?

A carder? Bouncer? True, these
services are performed at times by
the “guy at the door,” but a more
precise title is an ‘ ‘economy minded
social and rehabilitating restrain-
ment counselor.”

“This job can really try your
patience,” said 24-year-old Wayne
Standish, a 5’ll", 195 lb. counselor
at Peter's Pub. “You've got to deal
with so many different people.”

“Some people will show me a
license with the date of birth
changed with a crayon or magic
marker," Standish said. “Then,
when I tell them they can’t come in,
they insult my intelligence by
asking me why.”

With a M.A. in public admini-
stration, Standish works at Peter's
Pub to “get a few bucks on the
side” until he can ﬁnd a job in his
ﬁeld.

“Girls are 100 times harder to
deal with than guys,” Standish
said. ‘ ‘You tell a guy his ID isn't any
good and they respect you and
leave. But girls, they always give
you ‘Why isn't it any good’ or ‘I was
here before’ and ‘I'm older than
21.!!!

At 12:15 a.m., Standish looked at
the bills in his hand. “A
hundred-and sixty-three dollars.
That's pretty good for this time of
the night. If the crowd picks up
tonight we'll make about $250 with
cover charge. We made 8460 with
cover charge the Saturday Notre
Dame played Pitt.”

Three guys came by and said

“Hi” to Standish. He gave them a ,

nod; they didn’t pay a cover. “We
don’t charge our regular customers.

They're usually here three or four
times a week; they drink more than
the cover,” Standish said.

Two men came to the door.
Standish put his hand with the
money in front of them. “Dollar
cover charge, please,” he said.

The two men seemed surprised.
Obviously, they weren’t regulars.

“What’s the cover for?” one of
them asked. Standish shrugged his
shoulders and said, “That's the
rules."

The two men looked at each
other;one of them tilted his head
toward Forbes Avenue and they
walked away.

“You’ve got to have a cover
charge,” Wayne said. “That way
you eliminate a lot of riff-raff and
you get at least a buck from those
people who just come into the place
and don’t drink.”

Joe Morris, manager of Zelda's
Greenhouse, feels the counselor at
the door is important in selecting
one's clientele.

“You can eliminate a lot of
problem people if you watch who
you let inside of your place, ’ ’ Morris
said.

“If someone comes to the ‘door
and they're juiced and they give you
some trouble, then you won't let
them in,” Morris said. “Or if they
gave you trouble before. There's
enough business here in Oakland
that you can select your clientele.”

A group of men and women came
to Peter's Pub. “Cards, please,”
Standish said to the women, who
entered ﬁrst. They showed him
cards, he checked them, they were
inside. '

The men heard Wayne's request
for cards, and got their cards ready
for inspection.

“A dollar cover, please,” Wayne

s.a,id_.t_9 tlxgﬁrst gym \3vh9_19°.k€=<_1 3‘

him mistrustfully and said, “What
do you mean,cover? You didn’t
charge those girls anything."

“Girls don’t have to pay cover,”
Wayne said, as he took the money
from the more passive guys. The
inquisitive fellow shook his head
and handed Wayne his dollar.

Attempts to get by the wunselor
vary with degree of skill, imagin-
ation and violence.

A guy holding a duffel bag and
sporting a crew cut and black
glasses with a black tapco,
reinforced nose bridge attempted to
enter C.J. Barney's.

“Cards please,” the manager
asked the man, who seemed
confused by the request.

The guy then reached under him
lime-colored sweater and presented
the manager with dog tags.

“Will these do, they're all I
have,” he said with a serious face.

“Ah.. .no, I don’t think we can let
you in with those. We need a
picture with some I.D.” the
manager answered.

“Some people will come here with
licenses that they've cut the year of
birth out of and pasted a newone
on,” the manager said. He looked
at the bright lights _above him.

‘ ‘With these lights, it’s easy to see if
someone messes with their license.
But if they do a really good job, ” he
laughed, “I’ll let them in for trying
so hard.”

Phil Albensi is a counselor for
Chances R. He's 22 years old, 5’9",
165 lbs. and a deputy coroner for the
city during the day. Since Chances
R has two entrances—Bouquet
Street and Oakland Avenue—they
use two counselors. Albensi works
the latter entrance.

Albensi said a 50-year-old man
wearing a rain coat refused to pay
the cover charge one night.

“I asked the guy for a dollar and
he said, ‘I never paid the cover here
andl don’t plan on paying it now,”’
Albensi said. “He pulled out over
$200 in large bills and said ‘Look,
I'm going to be spending all this
money in here and you ain’t going to
let me in here for a dollar?”’

“My friend was standing by and
told the guy to pay the dollar or just
leave and then he (his friend)
walked away. Then this guy pulled
out this gun, it looked like a .38 or
.45, and started waving it around
saying ‘That kid don’t have his shit
together, he's going to lose his
head.”’

“After he pulled the gun, I was
going to let him in and then call the
police, but I used some psychology
and talked him into putting the gun
away and_l_1_e left,” Albensi said._

Albensi said the most popular
excuse he receives is someone
claiming to have left his wallet in his
car. Just as he ﬁnished saying this,
two guys came to the door. One was
about 6'3” and close to 200 lbs., and
the other was about 5'7” and 150
lbs.

“Can I see you cards, plase?”
Albensi asked them. . The smaller
guy pulled out an LCB card while
the other guy said, ‘ ‘Hey man, look.
Ileft my cards in my car and it’s like
three blocks away and I really don’t
feel like going back and getting
them.”

“I’m sorry but I've got to see
some ID,” Albensi said.

“Hey man, look. Like I know Jack
Lambert, he comes here all the
time..I even partied with him a
couple of weeks in here,” the guy
without the cards said.

It was now 1:15 a.m. Inside
Chancer R, and Arabian fellow with
a 10-inch Afro punched another
Arab, who was sitting down.
Within seconds, they guy sitting
down, along with a few others, were
kicking and punching the Afro-
haired guy, who was lying on the
ﬂoor.

“Look, a ﬁght.” “Where?"
“Come on, let's get out of here
before there’s trouble," two girls
said to each other. They guzzled
their drinks, grabbed their purses
and left.

Albensi looked toward the
commotion of the ﬁght and the
self-alleged friend of Jack Lambert
sneaked behind him to join his
friend at the bar. -

“I don't like to ﬁght," Grace
said, And if they give me
trouble, you know what I do?”
Grace grabbed an empty aluminum
beer can from one of the tables,
crushedone end of it, placed it
between his molars like a vise, and
ripped the can in half.

Grace saw the ﬁght, ran over to
break it up, and miraculously
managed to escort the Afro-haired
guy to the street.

Grace leaned the guy against a
white Maverick parked in front of
the bar. There was blood on the
door because the guy kept his
balance with the same hand with

,which he rubbed the cuts on his lip

and cheek.
“Look at what you did to my

looked to the ground.

“Why did you start that ﬁght?"
Grace asked. “You know, I use to
think you were really a cool guy.
You used to come in here with nice
suits on, looking all dressed up, and
now look at you."

Grace stood close to the guy as he
waited for the police to pick him up.
A campus police car came by and
Grace ﬂagged them down. Thex,

when Nikki, the manager of
Chancer R, came to the door and
pointed at the bleeding kid.

“If you ever come in here again,
I'm going to blow your brains out, ' ’
Nikki yelled with a slight lisp.

Nikki walked back inside; Grace
followed him, then came back out.
No one watched to make sure that
the guy didn't leave. He was still
there when Grace came back about

a minute later.

“Just get out of here,” Grace
said to the guy, and led him toward
Forbes Avenue.

A Pittsburgh policeman came by
with his dog and a crowd of 10 or 15
realized the incident was over.
Some left; others went back inside
the bar.

“Nikki said to let him go,” Grace
said. “He’s not going to press

A MESSAGE To?

CHANCELLOR we

I wish to alert all members of the University community to
the fact that our crisis is by no means at an end. The fact that
the state legislature recently passed an appropriation bill for
the University of Pittsburgh and the other state-related univer-
sities does not mean that our state funds will be forthcoming.
No money can be disbursed to any of the state-related univer-
sities and other educational institutions until the legislature
finds some means to close the gap between projected revenues
and expenditures. 1;-

As you know, higher education is not in any way respon-
sible for this gap; we have been placed in a role of hostage in an
attempt to find a way to fund all of a state budget exceeding five
billion dollars.

while we can be appreciative that both the House of
Representatives and the Senate passed the appropriation bill
for Pitt, Penn State and Temple with significant majorities, we
must not let this lull us into any sense of relief. Until the

Cinema

Cosby Supreme In
‘Piece of the Action’

By PATTY TASCARELLA

A Piece of the Action
Directed by Sidney Poitier
Warner Brothers

“A Piece of the Action” is not a
bad ﬁlm. A cast that includes
Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones
and Bill Cosby just couldn't fail and
in fact, each actor is excellent. The
problem is, it’s been done better
before.

Poitier (who also directed the
ﬁlm) and Cosby play a pair of crooks
who are pushed into “volunteer-
ing” to help out in a program for
underprivileged Chicago children.
Jones portrays the retired police-
man who gives the two the
nudge—he has enough evidence
against them through their careers
as theives to send them to jail.

Of course, their old underworld.
friends keep turning up now and
21222-39. .k.¢99.-?°iti<i5.99<2.. §°§bY
properly on edge. Denise Nicholas
and Tracy Reed provide the
romantic interest and Ja’Net
DuBois is on hand as a heavy-drink-
ing aunt. The children Poitier and
Cosby are supposed to be helping
are a group of undereducated
know-it-alls.

One sees shades of Crosby and
Hope in the forties. All ‘ ‘A Piece of
the Action” needs is Doris Day to
walk in camera range. The plot is
too similar to a made-for-TV pilot
brought to the big screen only
because of its overload of big name
actors.

“A Piece of the Action” is too

predictable—-one knows that some-
how, Jones can bully Cosby and
Poitier into shape, that the two
crooks are really softies at heart,
that Reed and Nicholas can keep
them in line with a soulful glance
and it’ll all work out ﬁne.

This ﬁlm is a washed out repeat of
Poitier’s previous hit “Uptown
Saturday Night” in which Cosby
also co-starred. The buddy theme,
the streetwise kids, and the cute
crooks routine are getting old.

The redeeming feature of “A
Piece of the Action” is the acting.
Poitier is debonair as always, the
brains of the duo. He’s smooth and
strong, a perfect contrast to the
zaniness of Cosby.

As usual, Cosby steals the
picture-—he brings a vital charac-
terization to the ﬁlm. He gets the
best lines (his timing is so perfect
you could set your watch from it)
and plays them for all they're worth,
without hamming it up. Catbur-
glar Cosby’s l2-story lead is
hilarious.

Jones is a bit of a disappoint-
ment—he never quite emerges
from his stereotypic policeman
role—but Reed and Nicholas are
surprisingly realistic as Poitier’s
and Cosby’s girlfriends. Reed
particularly scores as a kidnap
victim Poitier rescues in one of
“action’s’ ’ better scenes.

The problem is, it’s easy to expect
more than what you get in “A Piece
of the Action.” It's a wholesome
film and there's plenty of laughs,
but one can catch it in reruns almost
any day.

‘Mr. Goodbar: ’

Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier star in “A Piece Of The Ac-
tion," a film about crooks who avoid jail by working at a

big brothers’ project in Chicago. Although certain scenes
shine, the film is unoriginal.

Hard Hitting Film

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
“Looking For Mr. Goodbar” .
Directed by Richard Brooks
Paramount

“Looking for Mr. Goodbar” is
one of the most intense and
compelling ﬁlms to be released this
year.

Based on Judith Rossner’s
best-selling novel, it stars Diane
Keaton in the title role of a young
girl, Theresa Dunn, with separate
daytime and nighttime personali-
ties and lifestyles.

By day, Dunn is a sweet,
compassionate teacher of the deaf;
by night, she gets eaten up by a dark
world of sleazy singles bar cruising,
orgies, horrible male acquaintan-
ces, drug addiction and despair.

Jennings’ Country Music

ByKEI’I‘HBRIAN

A mixed crowd, ranging in age from
the young 20's to the late S0’s,
gathered at the Stanley Theater this
weekend to listen to two of country
music’s premier volcalists, Hank
Williams, Jr. and headliner Waylon
Jennings.

Williams, the first to take the
stage, is the son of the legendary
country singer Hank Williams.
That leaves him with a big pair of

boots to ﬁll. Williams appealed to
both extremes in the audience. The
older folks, dressed in their leisure
suits, cheered loudly as he played
his father’s classic, “Your Cheatin’
Heart” and the housewives sighed
during the son’s rendition of his
father’s, “I’m so Lonesome I Could
Cry.”

Bearded longhaired youths tilted
back their stetsons and opened their
eyes to hear “Playing a Little
Homegrown,” an upbeat ballad

about the elder Williams, written by
the younger. City oowgirls bounced
in their seats to “Sweet Home
Alabama,” which Williams dedi-
cated to the late Ronnie Van Zant.

Williams mellowed some of the
song’s pointed lyrics aobut Water-
gate and Neil Young, but he did no
such thing to its electric style and
loudness. He hasn’t ﬁlled his
father’s boots yet, but he doesn't
need to. He’s too busy making his
own pair, a different style suited to
today.

After a surprisingly short break,
the Outlaws and Waylon Jennings
brought a piece of Texas to
Pittsburgh. Ironically, Jennings led
off with Neil Young's “Are You
Ready For The Country.” The
bearded guitarist wore a black
Western hat over his long, dark
hair. Over his left shoulder hung a
white strap, which bolstered his
six-stringer.

A small cheer rose from the crowd
as “Amanda You Light Up My Life”
ﬁlled the air. This is an inspiring
love song that received its loudest
applause after the line, “I ﬁnally
made forty and I’m still wearing
jeans.”

Country music takes a conser-

(Continued on Page I I)

Keaton is absolutely superb in
her characterization of Dunn,
breathing freshness, innocence and
naivete into her daytime Theresa
with angelic ease. Director Richard
Brooks makes smolder with seedy
sensuality as the story and settings
shift from the straight world of the
young teacher to the sad and offbeat
existence of the young swinger.

What_ makes the film so worth-
while and effective—The grimy and
fascinating examination of Ther-
esa’s strange world—is what also
makes the ﬁlm so : depressing._

In the story, Theresa’s Irish
heritage and strict Catholic up-
bringing are initially what make her
so sexually repressed. Her parents
love her, but can’t accept that their
daughter wants to strike out on her
own and ﬁnd her own identity after
she graduates from college.

Theresa’s emotional problems
start during her last term in college,
when she’s a teaching assistant and
sexual plaything for an egotistical
and snotty English instructor (Alan

Jazz Masters Tackle

Feinstein). He treats her poorly and
lets her know he keeps her around
just for his jollies.

It is Feinstein who indoctrinates
Theresa to both the joys and pains of
sex. This creates the problem of
what she wants from men—lustful
brutality and abuse or tender and
real love.

Feinstein is the ﬁrst of Theresa’s
three love interests. The second,
Tony, a young leather-boy hustler
she meets in one of her earliest bar
outings, is played with depth by
newcomer Richard Gere.

Make no mistake about it, Tony’s
no heroic-type Fonzie. Instead, he
epitomizes the most opportunistic
and leacherous aspects of gritty
street life.

Theresa’s ﬁnal and most affec-
tionate love interest, James, is
played by the calm, clean-cut
William Atherton.

Theresa’s parents never meet the
disgusting Tony, but are taken by

Technical Difficulties

By GARY T. ZOLYAK

“Return of the Jazz Masters,”
seven of the ﬁnest jazz musicians in
the world, assembled Saturday
night at Carnegie Music Hall.

With this group of high claiber
musicians, the evening had the
potential to be one of the season's
most exciting performances.
However, their musical brilliance
could not offset the problems
created by technical difﬁculties in
the sound system.

The musical brillance of soprano
saxophonist Nathan Davis, vibeist
Terry Pollard and drummer Kenny
Clarke were most evident in their
creative variations of the songs
“Why Fall In Love,” “Lover Man”
and “Fried Bananas.”

The four remaining musicians,
experts in their own right, provided
skillfully spontaneous background
for Davis, Pollard and Clarke.
Trumpeter Woody Shaw and tenor
saxophonist Dexter Gordon worked
in an alternating “call and
response” form, while bassist
Abraham Laboriel and pianist Mike

Longo, who has played with Dizzy
Gillepie, blended their diverse,
rhythmic styles.

This collection of jazz immortals
admirably tried to counteract
Carnegie Music Hall's failing
sound system.

During each of the ﬁrst three.

songs, one of the seven onstage"¢";.,

microphones died, taking away an
integral part of the music. The
confusion this created was not only
annoying to the audience but was
distracting to the musicians.

Technicians ran on and off stage
and the musicians screamed at
them; the audience became
irritated and restless. This took
away from the audience’s enjoy-
ment of the concert as well as the
musicians’ professional appear-
ance.

In this irregular situation, the
concert’s climax was the drumming
of world-famous Kenny Clarke.

In honor of his accomplishments
in the ﬁeld of music, Clarke was
presented with two. awards.. . . ..

Sanford-Townsend

Impressive In Concert

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

An enthusiastic audience greeted
the Sanford-Townsend Band when
they appeared at the Stanley
Theater Friday night. Immediately,
the band swung into the heavy
rhythm and blues (R&B) sound that
is their trademark.

With John Townsend banging
away at the piano, dancing and
bobbing with the beat, and Ed
Sanford doing likewise on the
organ, the group progressed
through a medley of widely ranging
sounds, creating a ﬂashy spectacle
of music and motion that the crowd
really enjoyed. -

Otis Hale’s rich, bluesy sax stood
out throughout the concert, linger-
ing and intensifying with the heavy
beat. The two guitarists furnished
some excellent picking while the
drummer and bass player provided.
a hard, heavy tempo.

Songs like “Move up to
Paradise” had that good hard R&B
sound, while “Sunshine in My
Heart” proved the band could do
nice ballads, too. Sanford and
Townsend put spirit into their vocal

marriage partner for their daught-
er.

Theresa has other things in mind.
Tony represents the excitement of
her bizarre and shallow nightlife,
whi1e)James reminds her of her
parents and how they want her to
be.

Perhaps the saddest and most
disturbing aspect of the ﬁlm is the
great joy and love Theresa is
capable of creating in her day job as
ateacher of the deaf, and the depths
of despair she reaches as the
hard-boiled, liberated swinger.

Some of Keaton’s scenes with the
children (in particular, Amy, a little
black girl) bring tears to one’s eyes.

and instrumental work, which the
audience sensed. The two vocalists
performed excellent harmony on
the ballad.

The band also performed some
funk as an addition to their
repertoire. The “twangy” bass
and vivid beat produced an
interesting sound.

clapping as the group moved into
the easy rocking sounds of its
current hit, “Smoke From a Distant
Fire.” Keyboards, sax and bass
combined to produce the sound
that has made that song a hit. It
was a ﬁne way to climax the
concert.

After the band gave a good night
and many fervent thanks, the
crowd stood for an encore, which
they received.

Having been writers for the past
few years, the musicians Sanford
and Townsend are relative new-
comers to music; they have just
started singing and performing.

concern for Amy that Theresa meets '

Amy’s honorable older brother,
played in a few brief scenes by
“Roots” star LeVar Burton.

He is at ﬁrst disdainful of Theresa
when he sees her showing so much
affection toward his sister. But as
time goes by, he starts to attend
classes to watch Theresa work.

In one of the movie's memorable
scenes Burton comes to her rescue,
giving the oily Tony a well-deserved
shot to the groin when Tony
harasses her outside the classroom.

Another gem of a performance is
turned in by Tuesday Weld, as
Theresa's spaced-out older sister,
Katherine. g

orgies, sex, drugs and emotional

 

said, “I like it all. . .Writing is a
creative process. Naturally, it is
much more rewarding to sing and
perform one’s own material. ’

“A lot of R&B artists and New
Orleans people have inﬂuenced
us,” Townsend explained. Also,
many Southern black artists from
the l960’s have inﬂuenced the
group and its music.

The two musicians are conﬁdent
their style of music can appeal to
many people. “We do lots of
tunes," said Townsend, “including
country ballads, R&B and rock.”

Lyrically, we have our own
style...I think it’s ours; even
though the group has been
inﬂuenced by other musicians,”
Sanford added. _

Townsend said, feeling the tour
helped the band get some needed
exposure. This year the band has
traveled with such notables as
Dave Mason and Fleetwood Mac.

Their next album should be
released in early 1978. If the album
continues to reﬂect the band’s
remarkable talent,it should be
something to look forward to.

excess. But it is a world from which
she eventually escapes.

One of the ﬁlm’s strongest scenes
occurs just after Tony breaks in and
beats Theresa. Katherine and
Theresa lie on the bed while
Katherine applies a popsicle (she
didn’t have any ice) to Theresa's
battered face. Then, cockroaches
attack them.

“Looking for Mr. Goodbar” is a
highly intense and stark in its‘
depiction of an emotionally unbal-
anced girl’s struggle for direction
and meaning from life. One feels
compassion for her inevitable
failure, even though disintegration
and personal depravity is a decision
of her own choosing.

The next tune, “I’ll Go Back To

softly and muttering to the band.
He ﬁnally faced the crowd and said,

Pitt Squeezes By Orange, 8-21

ByJIMLEWIS

It took a one-yard touchdown run
by quarterback Matt Cavanaugh
with only 1:04 left in the game for
the 12th-ranked Pitt Panthers to
beat the surpri_singly stubborn
Syracuse Orangemen, 28-21, at Pitt
Stadium Saturday.

“It was a great, great football
game...” Syracuse head coach
Frank Maloney said. “I don’t know
what else to say. It was one of the

toughest losses I've ever
experienced. I am emotionally
drained.”

As were the 43, 551 Pitt fans who
took it upon themselves to scream
Syracuse ﬁeld goal kicker Dave
Jacobs into a costly 37-yard ﬁeld
goal miss with only 12:51 remain-
ing——a miss that killed the
Orange's chances of jumping to a
10-point lead.

“We didn't play, very well,”
Panther head coach Jackie Sherrill
stated, “but we showed some
character coming back in the fourth
quarter. Things were going
against us during most of the
game, but this didn't affect our
kids. They played up to their
potential when they had to in the
second half and were able to make
the big plays, both offensively
and defensively.”

But in the ﬁrst half, no one made
the big plays as Syracuse stole an
18-14 halftime lead.

Steady Fred Jacobs’s fumble-—
one of nine for Pitt on the afternoon

(including three on the ﬁrst three
plays)—paved the way for an
Orange 49-yard field goal early in
the first quarter, giving Syracuse
an early lead, 3-0.

The Panthers tied the score on
Dave Trout’s 43-yard ﬁeld goal on
the following possession, sending
both teams into a crazy second
period deadlocked 3-3.

The Orangemen wasted no time
establishing another lead, as
standout quarterback Bill Hurley
commandeered his squad 78 yards
and, thanks to Bob Avery’s
three-yard touchdown surge,
quickly put Pitt behind.

Then the Panthers took posses-

sion, and, before the scoreboard
had time to change the score,
Cavanaugh threw to tight end
Steve Gaustad for a 39-yard
ﬁrstdown pass, moving Pitt to the
Orange 19-yard line. One play
later, Willie Taylor snagged a
Cavanaugh 19-yard touchdown
pass and Pitt drew to within one
point. .

But a measly, game-tying
extra-point try wasn’t good enough
for. the Panthers, who pride
themselves on their exciting play.
Torn Yewcic fumbled the snap from
center and instinctively stood and
looped a pass into the end zone to
Gaustad, who broke as soorn as he
saw the mistake.

Gaustad dropped the ball after a
second’s possession, but it was

ruled a Syracuse defender interfer-
red and Pitt was awarded a
makeshift two points to vault ahead
of the upset-minded Orangemen,
11-10.

But before anyone could cherish
the Panther lead, Syracuse had
them slouching in their seats with
disappointment.

Hurley went to work again-this
time with a 45-yard ﬁrst-down pass
to Art Monk that enabled the
Orange to set up shop on the Pitt
20. Three plays later, Avery scored
his second touchdown of the

afternoon, bulling for one yard.
Hurley then passed to Mike Jones
in the end zone for a two-point
conversion, thus giving Syracuse
an 18-11 edge.

But Pitt wasn’t dead, threaten-

ing to score again from the
Syracuse 19-yard line. But the
offense sputtered, and the

Panthers had to settle for a Mark
Schubert 41-yard ﬁeld goal and an
18-14 disadvantage.

“Our running game was poor
and our blocking at the point of
attack had a lot to do with it,”
Sherrill explained.

The third quarter was chock-full
of big plays, holding the total
scoring by both teams to a scant
three points—all Syracuse points,
however.‘ Jacobs hit on a 41-yard
ﬁeld goal attempt following a
recovery of Elliot Walker’s fumble
on the Pitt 48.

Not that either team couldn't

Hurie y Almost Does It Again

ByJIM PANE

Bill Hurley almost did it again.

Forythe second time in as many
years, the Syracuse quarterback
nearly sent a Pitt Stadium crowd
home in amazement, as he
singlehandedly staged a magical
offensive performance and just
about ruined all pre-game predic-
tions of an easy Panther victory.

Favored by as much as 19 points
going into Saturday’s game, Pitt
didn't take its second and ﬁnal lead
until 64 seconds before the final
buzzer, securing a 28-21 win and
boosting its season mark to 5-1-1.

Last year, Hurley dazzled the
Panther defense by leading
Syracuse to a school record of 303
total yards and it took stone wall
defensive stands on two successive
plays by Pitt to squeeze the life out
of the Orange and give the
Panthers a hard-fought 23-13
victory.

The junior signal caller was no
less awesome Saturday, as he
completed 13 of 26 passes for 203
yards, rushed for 45 and generaled
the offense to a total of 366,
keeping the Pitt defense pretty

’ much confused.

“They had a good game plan
that they executed well,“ Pitt
coach Jackie Sherrill said after the
game. “They caught us off guard
with some of their passing routes.”

The Syracuse offense has been

keeping‘ a 'lot of‘ people’ off ‘ guard *

these days—just ask Penn State.
In last week's confrontation against
the Nittany Lions, Hurley set ﬁve
school records and forced Penn
State to ﬁght to hold on to a 31-24
nailbiter.

“It was a different feeling last
week against Penn State,” Hurley
said in a quiet Orange locker room.
“We never were ahead in that
game—we always were coming
back, coming back and we just fell
short. Today, we had it but we let
it get away.”

An exact reversal of last year’s
encounter, when it could be said
that the Panther defense won the
game. Syracuse could very well
blame Saturday’s loss on blatant
fourth-quarter confusion when,
with the score knoted at 21, the
Orangemen were penalized on two
successive drives for delay of game
in kicking situations, the last of
which may have cost them a
go-ahead ﬁeld goal.

“We tried to draw them off sides
with the sucker shift,” Orange
coach Frank Maloney admitted.
“We wanted to keep possession by
getting them to come offsides on
fourth and short situations but we
executed the shift very poorly.”

As a result, on the second of
those penalties, Syracuse was
pushed back ﬁve yards for delay of
game and J .C. Wilson blocked
Dave Jacobs’ ensuing ﬁeld goal
attempts, setting up Pitt's winning
5(3);-e_ ., . . . , ,

“Unbelievable, ’ ’ Maloney said.
after being turned away for the
second straight week. “It was a
great, great football game. I don't
know what else to say."

Asked if he considered his
Syracuse squad to be the best 2-5
team in the nation, Maloney
answered, “Maybe. But that
doesn't take away the sting.”

If Hurley continues to play at his
present level, however, the
Orangemen could be in a position to
start stinging a few opponents
themselves—without falling short.
He has already gained the respect
of many across the land, who
consider him to be one of the best
option passers around. This group
includes Sherrill, who said, “I
don’t know if there is a quarterback
I respect more.”

But for now, Maloney and the
rest of the Orange will have to live
with the fact that someone has to
sting and someone has to get
stung.

‘ ‘Right now, I’m just a tired, tired
man,” Maloney said.

 

  

points—both squads had ample
opportunities to score—but key

plays like Randy Holloway’s
seven-yard quarterback sack
during a Syracuse surge and

Gerald Martin's interception of a
Cavanaugh third-and 16 pass kept
both teams off-balance and the
Orange still leading, 21-14.

After Jacobs’s missed ﬁeld goal
attempt, the Panthers went to
work—or so it seemed. Pitt offense
again stalled, this time at its own
29-yard line, forcing Joe Gas-
parovic to punt. All seemed lost
when Terry O'Leary returned the
kick to Pitt's 49-yard line—an
enviable position from which to
start to clinch a game.

But on the ensuing play, Monk
turned an apparent seven-yard
gain into a Bob Jury fumble
recovery, and Panther fans had
hope once more.

And Pitt didn't disappoint.
Cavanaugh passed to Jacobs, who
rambled 58 yards for the tying
touchdown with less than 10
minutes left.

Both teams had a chance to take
a three-point lead late in the
game—Syracuse with a 42-yard
field goal attempt and Pitt with a
52-yard try. But again, it was big
plays in the form of blocked kicks
(Wilson blocked the Orange kick,
Warren Harvey blocked the
Panther boot) that kept the score a t
a nailbiting 21-21 with only 4:57
remaining.

Once Pitt took the ball after
Wilson's block on its own 36, the
situation was obvious: score or
settle for a tie. But due to a clutch
Cavanaugh to Gordon Jones
45-yard pass, the Panthers had a
ﬁrst and goal on the Syracuse
one-yard stripe. After two fruitless
plays, Cavanaugh crashed over the
goal line for the victory.

A victory that was a relief
considering the Pitt injury list.

“Logan, Marinich, Green and
Chesley couldn't start,"Sherrill
explained. “We had to move Steve
Fedell, a noseguard, to defensive
end and put Gary Boyarski, a
tackle, into the noseguard position.

Holloway had to play numerous
positions. Our trouble is that we
have to get our regular people
back.”

The lack of a few key starting
defensemen only enhanced Syra-
cuse quarterback Hurley's
danger-he finished with 13
completions out of 26 tries for 203
yards plus 45 yards rushing.

“That Hurley is a gutty little

kid,” Sherrill said. “He certainly""?y

has to be one of the best option
passing quarterbacks in the land."

And thanks to Cavanaugh’s
one-yard dash, Pitt continues to be
one of the best teams in the
country.

Syracuse quarterback Bill Hurley drove Pitt defenders crazy for the secon year
in a row. Coming oti a record-breaking performance against Penn State in a
losing effort last week, Hurley and the Orange came up just short once again.

In the End, Gaustad “Seams” Important

By KAREN KADILAK

How important was Steve Gaus-
tad to the Pitt offense in the
Panthers’; 28-21 win over Syracuse
Saturday at Pitt Stadium?

Check these facts, and you should
be convinced that if it weren’t for
the Panthers’ tight end, Pitt might
be 5-2-1 instead of 6-1-1:

Gaustad caught a game high of
six passes for 107 yards.

He scored on a crucial two-point
conversion attempt after the ﬁrst

Pitt touchdown on a pass from Tom
Yewcic.

His block allowed Matt Cavan-
augh to swot around end for the
winning touchdown with a little
more than a minute left in the game.

But, of all the good things he did,
catching the football was what
Gaustad did best against the
Orangemen. Two of his six catches
set up Panther scores. Three
produced key ﬁrst downs in a game
where ball-control offense was the
order of the day.

“We just took what they gave
us,” the junior said, while sitting
among a cluster of reporters in a
steamy Pitt locker room. “They
gave us some leeway in the seams,
so we took advantage of it.

“The safety overshifted to
Gordon (Jones, Panther wide
receiver),” Gaustad continued, “so
I was wide open a lot of times.”

The ﬁrst of the important catches
the 6-4, 210-pound tight end from
New Cumberland, Pa. made in the
game resulted in a crucial Panther
ﬁrst down and set up a Pitt
touchdown in the second quarter.

With the ball on the Syracuse
42-yard line and the Orange
clinging to a 10-3 lead in the second
period, Cavanaugh dumped a quick
pass to Gaustad who, putting his 4. 7
speed to good use, rambled 39 yards
to the Syracuse 19 before being
knocked out of bounds.

(One play later, Cavanaugh found
Willie Taylor open in the end zone
for the ﬁrst Pitt six-pointer of the
afternoon.)

“It was a seam route,” Gaustad
explained. “Matt led me a bit, and I
caught it.”

No sooner had Gaustad caught
his breath than he was involved in
the action again.

But this time, the play was
controversial.

The Panthers were lined up for
the point-after attempt following
Taylor’s touchdown when holder
Tom Yewcic had trouble ﬁelding the
snap from center. Gathering the
loose football, Yewcic threw a
desperation toss to Gaustad in the
corner of the Syracuse end zone.

The tight end, leaping above a
Syracuse defender, couldn’t catch
the pass. But the official on the
play, ruling that the defender
interfered, awarded Gaustad the
catch and Pitt went ahead, 11-10,

Junior tight and Steve Gaustad led all Pitt receivers with six receptions against
a stingy Orange defense that played much better than many people expected.

with about 10 minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half.

‘ ‘Tommy saw me in the end zone
and he threw me the football,”
Gaustad stated. “I deﬁnitely felt
my feet hit the ground when the kid

hit me. I know I could have caught

the football if he hadn't hit me.”
Although Gaustad was in the

scoring column as a result of the
two-pointer, he regrets he didn’t
score a touchdown on the 39-yarder
in the second quarter.

“I was trying to put the moves on
somebody,” Gaustad said. “But
there will be other days. ”

No day will be half as important
as the one Gaustad had Saturday.

Steelers Spill Oilers, 27-10

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Quarter-
back Terry Bradshaw, who cracked
his left forearm two weeks ago
against Houston, threw two touch-
down passes to lead the Pittsburgh
Steelers to a 27-10 National Football

League victory over the same Oilers
Sunday.

Bradshaw, who wore a plastic
cast to protect the hairlinefracture,
did more than just hit 16 of his 24
passes for 227 yards.

He also threw a brush-block on a
screen pass that wide receiver John
Stallworth carried 49 yards for a
third-quarter touchdown that gave
Pittsburgh a 13-7 lead.

    ; Ye wait: '5 Wounds --Not Scars -- ealed

It would be an understatement to say Yewcic

Time, so they say, heals all wounds.

Take Tom Yewcic, for example. The Pitt
quarterback admits he was stung when Pitt head
coach Jackie Sherrill chose Wayne Adams, and
then Rick T rocano, instead of him to start at
quarterback while Matt Cavanaugh was out with
a broken wrist earlier this season.

However, whatever wounds Yewcic might
have incurred have healed since then.

“Looking back on the situation and seeing
how well Rick did for Matt,” Yewcic commen-
ted, “I don’t feel as bad as I once did.”

But while time heals wounds, it doesn’t
necessarily heal the scars that go along with the
wounds. Time definitely hasn’t healed Tom
Yewcic’s. Yewcic has beeil disappointed with the
way things have been going for him thus far. He

‘hasn’t seen any action at quarterback yet, and he

probably won’t either, since Sherrill plans to use
freshmen Trocano and Lindsay Delaney to back
up Cavanaugh for the rest of the season.

Unfair as it may seem, Yewcic has been prac-
tically wiped out from the Pitt quarterback
situation, his career suddenly‘taking a 180-degree
turn from the way it was going last year, when he
did such an admirable job helping lead the Pan-
thers to the national championship.

The scars are still there and Yewcic is disap-

pointed. Although he doesn’t come right out
and say it, Yewcic sort of hints he’s gotten a
bum deal this season.

“I guess they don’t care about personal
feelings,” Yewcic said softly. “I still don’t un-
derstand why they didn’t put me in when Matt

got hurt. I went into the season thinking I would
go in if Matt got hurt early in the season. In fact,
I was told that I would go in if something did
happen to Matt.

“But things didn’t work out that way,”
Yewcic continued, stating the obvious. “Jackie
put Wayne in there against Notre Dame, and
everyone knows what happened then. We just
couldn’t get anything going on offense. It’s
something that I don’t understand, my not
playing. When you have experience, you usually
play it. We didn’t that day.”

was disappointed when he left the Panther locker
room at Pitt Stadium following Pitt’s 19-9 loss to
the Irish. _

At the time, Yewcic looked totally out of it,
like he couldn’t believe what had just happened
to him.

“You noticed that too, huh,” Yewcic said
with a_ laugh. “All I could think about was how I
should have been in there.

“Even now,” Yewcic added, “I haven’t
played any quarterback yet. The only thing I can
figure out is that Jackie wants to play the

younger guys so they can get some experience.‘

He knows he won’t have me around next year,
so he’s probably ﬁguring let the younger kids
To this day, I don’t understand the
situation and I probably never will.”

For now, at least, Yewcic is pretty much con-
tent to sit back and let things go as they are. But
that’s not to say he won’t take some verbal shots
when the season’s over.

“The only thing I can say is that there is a time
and place for everything,” the senior concluded.

Although the wounds are healed, the scars are
still there. Look for Tom Yewcic to let off some
steam once the season’s over.

Booters Work Overtime
For a Clutch 1-0 Win

Pitt’s soccer team came away with
a close 1-0 decision over Grove City
Friday night, boosting its record to
6-4-1. This win, over a ﬁne
Wolverine squad (7-3), helped the
Panther booter’s_chances of attain-
ing an NCCAA playoff berth.

The game was a tight defensive
battle throughout and wasn't
decided until after 102 minutes of
play. The game winning goal was
scored by Tim Pearson at 2:09 of the
second overtime, when he took a
pass from the right wing that
evaded a Grove City defender,
allowing him to blast the ball past
the Wolvering goalie.

After the game, Pitt Coach Leo
Bemis said, ‘ ‘Although the shots on
goal were even (15-15), we had much
better shots and scoring opportuni-
ties.”

Senior Frank Bucci played an
exceptional game in goal, getting
his ﬁfth shutout of the season. In
the Panthers’ six wins, five have
been shutouts.

“We played to win and we
deserved it,” Bemis said. “It was a
team victory. No one in particular
stood out—-everyone did his part.

That was the name of the game

tonight.”

The Panthers are on the road for
the rest of the season, this week
traveling to Lock Haven for a Friday
afternoon confrontation.

Spikers ﬁnish Second

By JOHN FINN

The Pantherette volleyball
team continued its gradual im-

provement with a fourth-place A

ﬁnish this weekend at the Delaware
Invitational.

Pitt placed fourth in its bracket
by sweeping past its ﬁrst three
opponents rather handily. The
Pantherettes defeaed Lafayette,
Salisbury State and James Madison
by identical 2-0 scores to advance
into the playoffs.

In the quarterﬁnals, Pitt beat
Virginia Commonwealth, 2-0.
Pantherette head coach Mike
Hebert called Virginia Common-
wealth a surprisingly strong team
and said he was quite pleased with
his team’s performance this week-
end.

“We faced tough competition all
day,” he claimed, “but we were
equal to or above the challenge
each time.”

Pitt met Maryland for the third
time this season, and for the third
time came out on the short end.
Maryland defeated Pitt 2-1 in what
Hebert called “a very close
match.”

“We played exceptionally
against Maryland,” Hebert said,
“but they played even better.
They were unbelievalbe.”

Delaware defeated Maryland in

the ﬁnals 2-0 to win its own
invitational for the second con-
secutive year.

If successful defense of one’s
title is becoming a trend, it is good
news for the Pantherettes. Pitt
travels to the Salisbury State
Invitational this weekend, a
tournament comprised exclusively
of Eastern teams, and it will
provide Hebert with an opportunity
to assess his team’s chances
against teams he will see at
Eastern Regionals.

“Delaware, Temple and Mary-

land are all pretty much even as the
top contenders in the East,”
Hebert said, and we are now about
one step behind.”

Hebert will have one month to
close that gap. Eastern Regionals
are scheduled for November 18-19
and it is the biggest event of the
year for the Pantherettes.

“We hope to peak for Easterns,”
Hebert said. “I think anyone of
ﬁve teams can win the Eastern
title, and if we play our best at that
tournament, we have as good a
shot as any team.”

Poloists “Officially” Second at IU

By BOB LABRIOLA

The Pitt water polo squad
exempliﬁed team effort this week-
end, ﬁnishing second in the
Indiana Tournament by losing to
the host Hoosiers, 14-12, in the
championship match.

The Panthers were awesome in
the early rounds, defeating Illinois
and Purdue by the combined score
of 41-9.

In the Illinois match, Pitt
survived the loss of four starters to
fouls and outscored the Illini 11-1 in
the second half, winning l7-5. Luis
Toto led the way with five goals,
followed by Phillip Ruiz, who added
four. Five other Panthers combined
for the remaining eight tallies, and
Steve Feller was excellent in goal
with 12 saves to highlight the
victory.

“Illinois was an excellent
offensive team, but we knew where
their strengths were, we adjusted
our _zone and it killed them,”
beamed coach Rivera. “We had
lost four starters (to fouls) by the
second period, but the bench came
through for us like they have all
year."

Against Purdue, eight different
Panthers cracked the scoring
column as Pitt routed the Boiler-
makers, 24-4. Ruiz paced the
Panthers with ﬁve goals, Wynn
Hunkler added four and Mike
Mere, Greg Machicote and Mike
Schoﬁeld chipped in three goals
apiece. Purdue managed only six
shots on goal throughout the entire
match, as the Pitt zone continually
forced long shots that either were
blocked by the defense or sailed
wide of the net.

Once again, the Panthers found
themselves in foul trouble from the
outset, as ﬁve starters were
disqualiﬁed. Rivera met with the
ofﬁcials and tournament director at
halftime to get an explanation as to
which of Pitt’s actions were illegal.

“They (the officials) were giving
us personal fouls for things that
were not major violations,” Rivera
explained. “Naturally, there are
times when a player bumps into
someone, but in cases like that, the
official usually will just award a
free throw. Against us, they were
calling them personal fouls.”

Despite this, the Panthers kept
trolling along as Pitt jumped out to a

3-1 ﬁrst quarter lead in the
championship match against
Indiana. But the lead was

short-lived; in rapid succession,
Toro, Machicote and Ruiz picked
up two quick personal fouls‘ each
(three fouls mean disqualiﬁcation),
and Barry Ford was ejected for
“brutality.” Pitt managed to
survive, and at the half the score
was deadlocked, 8-8.

In the third period, the referees
went right to work as Tom,
Machicote and Ruiz quickly picked
up their third personals. Moments
later, Dave Diaz injured his right
wrist, but, because of the foul
situation, remained in the pool
(there is an .excellent chance the
wrist is broken).

At this point, Pitt turned to a
stingy defense and a controlled

pattern offense in an effort to keep
te ball away from the Hoosiers.

.With only 1:35 remaining in the

match and the Panthers clinging to
a 12-12 tie, the ofﬁcials handed
Indiana the championship.

With time running out and
Indiana in possession of the ball, a
penalty shot was called against
Pitt, and the Hoosiers converted to
take a 13-12 lead. In Pitt’s next
three possessions, the Panthers
were assessed with three offensive
fouls. Indiana added an insurance
goal after the third offensive foul,
winning the match 14-12.

Schoﬁeld scored five goals for
Pitt and Machicote added three in a
little more than two periods of play.

Once again, the Panthers lostﬁve
starters to personal fouls, while not
a single Indiana player was

disqualified.
“I doubt that the best team in
the nation could have won here
tonight,” said Rivera after the loss.
“I don’t want to blame the whole
thing on the referees, because

despite all the fouls we still had a A

chance to pull out a win, but a
couple of key turnovers late in the
fourth quarter killed us. All I know
is that by the end of thematch, the
crowd was cheering for us to pull it
out.

“The team showed a lot of class,
and everything seems to have come
together for us,” he continued.
“With the Conference Champion-
ships and E-asterns just around the
corner, I think we’re ready to start
paying some people back for taking
advantage of us earlier in the
season.”

Women Runners-up at Own In vite

By ANGELA VAVITIIES

The women’s cross country team
places second in the Pitt invita-
tional meet held Sunday morning in
Schenley Park. Three of Pitt’s
runners were among the top 15
finishers—Becky Falck (third),
Brenda Chorpenning (fourth), and
Diane Miller (ninth). Marie
Sciullo, who placed 19th, Diane
Weigle, who was 20th, and Jenny
Westman, who finished. 31st,
rounded out the Panterette ﬁeld.
Therese Walton, Pitt’s phenominal
freshman starter, was unable to
compete due to a stress fracture in
her leg.

The ﬁeld was composed of 38
women from six colleges.
First-place went to Slippery Rock
with a total of 28 points. The other
competing schools (in order of
finish) were California State
College, Allegheny Community
College, Bucknell University and
Trenton State College. Slippery
Rock’s Pat Weldon copped indivi-
dual honors with a time of 17:42.

The Pitt runners were pleased
with their performance on the
three-mile course that starts up
Flagstaff Hill, wanders around the
golf course and ends with a sprint

the same place it began. Many of
the other teams were used to less
hilly courses than this one, but the
Pantherettes liked the hills.

faster than former Panther Nick
Martin’s record time, set in 1975.
Ohio State’s Steve Crane, runner-
up‘ to Boyd, also beat the old mark,
running the slightly damp trails in
30.26.

Pitt’s Boyd and Dave McDonald _,

broke away from the pack early in
the race and were side-by-side after
two miles. Crane than began to
narrow the pair's 25-yard lead and
eventually passed McDonald, who
maintained the third position
(31.03) the rest of the way.

The Buckeye runner’s sudden
surge came as somewhat of a
surprise to Boyd.

“I knew I was pushing myself
pretty hard,” he said, “so it was a
little discouraging when I heard his

(Crane’s) footsteps coming up. I ,

guess I was just amazed that Ohio
State ran our course so well,
because they don’t practice running
hills the way we do.”

As a team, Pitt was too spread out
to make up for OSU’s sweep of
places four through seven. Mark
Studnicki (31.52), Gary Siriano
(31.56) and Randy Bailey (32.30)
ﬁgured as eighth, ninth and 12th in
the scoring.

In college football

Anyone Can Win on
Any Given Wednesday

By THE ASSOCIEATED PRESS

This may be a new one in the
book of college football clinches,
but it appears that any team can
beat any other team on any given
Wednesday.

Wednesday?

Well, the calendar said it was
Saturday when Minnesota stunned
No. 1-ranked Michigan, 16-0, and
No. 11 Notre Dame smashed
ﬁfth-ranked Southern California,
49-19, but...

“I had a gut feeling on
Wednesday that we could beat
Michigan,” said Minnesota coach
Cal Stoll.

“I knew Wednesday we were
going to win,” said Notre Dame
coach Dan Devine.

Michigan’s defeat opened the
door for second-ranked Texas,
which beat Southern Methodist,
30-14, to climb into the No. 1 spot
in the next Associated Press poll.
Meanwhile, third-ranked Alabama
swamped Louisville, 55-6—‘If we
just win our games I think we'll win
the national championship,” Bear

. Bryant said—~fourth-rated Ohio

State trimmed Northwestern,
35-15, and No. 6 Oklahoma belted
No. 16 Iowa State, 35-16.

Seventh-ranked Colorado,
previously unbeaten but once-tied,
bowed to No. 18 Nebraska, 33-15,
while No. 8 Kentucky trounced
Georgia, 33-0, No. 9 Arkansas
ﬂattened Houston, 34-0, and No. 10
Penn State bombed West Virginia,
49-28.

In the Second Ten, No. 12 Texas
A&M downed Rice, 28-14, No. 14
Pitt overtook Syracuse, 28-21,
UCLA edged No. 15 California,
21-19, No. 17 Brigham Young
shaded Wyoming, 10-7, No. 19
Florida outlasted Tennessee,
27-17. and No. 20 Clemson nipped
North Carolina State. 7-3.

Michigan's loss reduced the list
of major teams with perfect records
to just two. Texas and Colgate,
which outslugged Columbia, 48-36,
as Henry White galloped for 204
yards and three touchdowns.
Besides Michigan, Tennessee State
also dropped from the ranks of
unbeaten-untied teams, losing to
Florida A&M. 31-28.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER ‘I0

Michigan as Paul Kogind booted
field goals of 41. 37 and 31 yards,
Marion Barber scored on a short
run and a swarming defense
saddled the Wolverines with their
first shutout in 114 games and first
under Coach Bo Schembechler.

“Theigame was won with the
Minnesota defense," Schembech-
ler said. “We needed a big play
and never got it.”

The usually mistake-free Wol-
verines turned the ball over three
times on fumbles and twice on
interceptions.

“We kept handing them the
football and their offense did a
good job of moving it after we gave
them 10 points,” Schembechler
said.

“You have to get those kind of
breaks,” said Stoll. “It’s the only
way to beat Michigan.”

Meanwhile, Notre Dame
whacked Southern Cal in a way the
Trojans hadn't been beaten since a
51-0 rout at the hands of the
Fighting Irish in 1966. Only a
misses extra-point kept the Irish
from reaching the half-century
mark.

Joe Montana scored twice on
quarterback sneaks and threw a

pair of touchdown passes to Ken,

MacAfee while placement holder
Ted Burgmeier ad-libbed a two-
point conversion pass off a bad
center snap and later scampered 20
yards on a fake ﬁcid goal to set up a
key score with only 20 seconds
remaining in the first half.

“This was my most satisfying
victory ever,” said Devine, who
has been under ﬁre from over-
zealous Notre Dame supporters for

“‘only” showing a 22-7 record.

Texas‘ turned back stubborn
SMU as tailback Earl Campbell
rambled for a career-high 213 yards
in the rain, using six tear-away
jerseys as he broke one tackle after
another.
Michigan’s loss set jubilant Texas
fans dancing in the
Dallas's rain-swept Cotton Bowl.

The Longhorns were
early in the game on an 11-yard

touchdown pass from SMU's Mike '- .-

Ford to Emanuel Tolbert but roared
from behind with a 20-point burst
in the final six minutes of the first
half.

“I’ll talk to the ugliest looking girl
in the place just as I would to the
prettiest,” McLellan said. “Be-
cause they need that recognition
and sweet talk compliments, just
like everyone else.”

One girl told him he reminds her
of a big Santa Claus. “Why?”
McLellan asked jokingly. “In other
words, I look like a dirty old man
who comes around once a year."

“Ifthey’re too young, they get all
uptight when I ask them for cards.”
McLellan said. “The people who
are 21 and older are more natural
about it.”

A small girl walked into Danny’s
Pub. McLellan took her by the hand
and asked her for ID. She pulled out
a wallet and showed him a license

that said she’s 17 years old.
"Honey, you realize how young
you are,” McLellan said. “Why,
I’d get 50 years ifl even gave you a
kiss."
The girl wanted to look for her

boyfriend, whom she said was.

inside. She recently ran away from
home and is living with the guy.

“He told me he’d quit drinking,
but he’s inthere drinking,” she said
to McLellan.

“Look, you’ve got to forget about
that guy,” he said. “He’s no good
for you. He lied to you once and
he’ll do it again. lt’Il be hard to do
and it'll take some courage, but
believe me, forget about that guy
and go back to your parents. You've
got to believe they care for you."

McLellan talked to the girl for
over an hour as he carded at the
door. At times, she cried and

hugged her body against McLellan.
He patted her on the head and back
and gently swayed her.

, “Don't worry, Linda, you’ve got a
whole life ahead ofyou. It’s going to
get better. It’ll be tough at ﬁrst, but
you’ve got to hang in there,”
McLellan said.

She decided to go back home and
McLellan walked her toward Forbes
Avenue.

It was close to 2 a.m., and Mc-
Lellan was drinking beer from a
huge mug he brought back from
Germany when he was in the Army.
It was a long night, and he was
tired.

“You know, it’s a shame.
There's a lot of weak people in this
world and there’s a lot of sick ones
that take advantage of them,”
McLellan said. He shook his head,
then took a big swig from his mug.
