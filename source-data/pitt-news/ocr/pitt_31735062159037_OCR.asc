Catches Actor Leslie
Banks In Dishabille

l By LOIS LOOMIS
Brca.kin;; into the hotel suite
of Leslie Banks, leading man
of the Theater Guild produc-
tion, “\Vine of Choice,” may
not‘ be front page copy. But
when any actor is caught in pa-
jamas a.nd dressing gown while
shaving, remains calm and even
gallant about it, well that’s “man
bites dog” news.

Mr. Banks ushered us into the
living room and then vanished to
remove the lather from his chin.
He hadn’t time to be interviewed
before the play, the actor said,
almost apologetically. Would we
like to come back to his suite for
tea after the matinee performance
at the Nixon? Would we!

This Englishman, a mighty fine
actor playing the role of an ear-
nest politician in S. N. Behrman’s
comedy which co-stars Miriam
Hopkins, rates four stars as a reg-
ular fellow, even though the play
doesn’t measure up to its cast.

Leslie Banks made his first pro-
fessional appearance with Frank
Benson’s S‘n.a-kespearean company
as “Old G-obbo” in “The Merchant
of Venice.” During his school
days at Oxford. he became certain
he wanted to act.

Actor By Chance 

For a time Mr. Banks had set-
tied on entering the church. Then !
he turned to painting as a com-;
promise. One lucky day, friendsy
of the i'ami.ly saw him in an ama— l

teur pcrforinance, were so im-‘;
pressed that they convinced his’
parents Leslie must have his‘

chance as an actor.
Ie takes the development of the ,
theater seriously, too seriously
perhaps. Some of the existing
conditions in the theater today are
discouraging. Playwrights object
to cutting plays where they need
it. There are too few good pro-
fessional directors and too much
rehearsing is done on the road.

On the whole, drama is improv-
ing and the actor predicts greater
improvement in the future. Eng-
land is returning to repertory.
America will follow.

Films ‘Confusing’

American films? Heaven save
him from them! (With all due re-
spect to the industry). They are
too confusing. One makes lots of
money too quickly and that is
usually detrimental to any career.

Leslie Banks entered English
movies in 1932 and has been suc-
cessful, however. His most re-
cent pictures are “Far Over Eng-
land” and “Farewell Again,” Al-
exander Korda productions which
probably have not been shown in
the United States as yet.

His role in “Wine of Choice” is
the nearest‘ to a “straight” he
has ever played. Leslie Banks
does not allow his characters to
crystallize. Every performance
must be kept ﬂuid and he goes
over his lines every night in an
attempt to keep them so.

A little real drama nearly
spoiled our party. The tea was
cold and Leslie Banks resented
that like any true Englishman!

Lissfelt Fills Schedule
With Many Activities

By GERTRUDE LIEBLICH
Apparently the Tin Pan Alley composer who wrote “Time
on My Hands” never met J. Fred Lissfelt, University graduate
student, who ﬁlls his 18 waking hours each day with eiliciently

organized activities.

As a master of many trades, Mr. Lissfelt carries 12 credits
at the University; sponsors recitals, teaches music at Duquesne

university; gives private lessons,‘

lectures; and reviews concerts
before he is willing»to stop for the
day.

Oh, yes, he also. ﬁnds time to
read proofs on his new book, “Ba-
sic Principles of Artistic Singing;”
write ﬁve or six columns a week
for the Sun-Telegraph; sleep six
hours each night; and be a father
to his three sons. “Most of my
activities are ﬁnancially neces-
sary,” Mr. Lissfelt comments.

By no means an average grad-
uate student, Mr.
pleted his studies at Central high
school in 1904 and did not take
his bachelor of music degree here
until 1937. At present, he is work-
ing on his master’s degree, plan-
ning to continue for the doctor of
philosophy degree in history.

In the interval between his high
school graduation and college
matriculation, Mr. Lissfelt studied
for three years in Germany. He
returned to Europe seven succes-
sive summers.

During the World War, he act-
ed as an interpreter in the‘ Amer-
ican army in France. He returned

returned to Harrisburg.

to Pittsburgh to work for the Dis-

Lissfelt com—-

patch and then the Gazette—Tirnes
beforehe took up his present po-
sition with the Sun—Telegraph. In
addition, he has lectured in east-
ern United States in territory
from Atlanta, Georgia to James-
town, New York.

A decided advantage was gained
by postponing his college educa-
tion for more than 30 years, ad-
mitted Mr. Lissfelt. Although he
would not advise everyone to fol-
low his example, he does believe
that students “should do practical
work at the same time they are
learning their theory. The young-
er generation annoys me with its
lack of organization,” he says.
“My particular grouch is how un-
thinkingly young students waste
their opportunities. They post-
pone and dawdle so much.”

But Mr. Lissfelt, who learned
his strict discipline in the army,
does not think that young college
students are insincere. “They just
never learned to discipline them-
selves.” Notwithstanding, he re-

gards it important to know the

coming generation. “I’m for them
tremendously. I believe in the
‘spirit of the times.’ ”

;continue into the evening. They
‘are priced at four dollars per

couple, and include, beside the
orsages, favors, and a novel type
of program.

Ticket sales and other arrange-
:ments for tonight’s affair, which
‘is the first formal school dance
of the year, have been in charge
of a committee headed by Mayer
and business manager Bob Dan-
nies, C.

At Duquesne, a new publications board, to

‘We are conﬁdent, however, that the editors

Barnestorm

“I,” said the professor, “am a disillusioned reac-
tionary.”

“Is it had?” asked Mabel.

“Moderately so,” replied the Professor tl:iouglit-
fully. “It is not, of course, as bad as being a dis-
appointed Communist, since when one is a Com-
munist. one has certain ideals, certain tenets, to
which one can hold. When one loses faith in these
tenets and becomes disappointed, '.heret’ore, the fall
from faith is a long one.

   

“Reactionaries have tio such principles; they build
their principles out of negative reactions to the posi-
tive Comnitinistic doctrines.‘ 'I‘hereI'ore, being disil-
lusioned means simply that one has no longer a be-
lief in the negative ideals of conservatis1'n.”

Sounds complicated to me,” said Mabel, darning
socks at a great rate.

And The Times Change

“It i::n’t really. It’s quite simple. Being :1 Com-

:'I’l’1LllllSl.  that one advocates certain girinciples
of .‘—.§i.)‘\/’(-2l.‘l’l1’[1r3D.‘£ which are radically different from

'.l.’l€ jorinciples rilready in use. Being :1 reactionary
means that one sets up a loud automatic howl in
favor of standing pat. There is nothing compli-
cated about it. Indeed, up to this point, I have been
a reactionai‘y because it is simpler to be so. It is
really easier to think of objections than  is to think
of something to which soineone else might object.
At least I found it so.

“Now, however, I find that my ideas have changed.
I ﬁnd in studying the lives and times of English
monarchs that the policy of rugged individualism
is the idea always advanced by the merchants, a
class who stand to beneﬁt ironi the ﬁnancial advan-
tages. Social beneﬁts are not their policy. The
proper attitude, I am come to think, means thinking
always in terms of the poor and underprivileged.
W must take a ﬁrm stand on the question, tax the
rich unmercifully, talk glowingly about the WPA,
and by such stringent measures convince the body
of the middle-class that we must think in terms of
making the world safe for aliens and unemployed.

The Ric]: Or Wlzat?

“The country is in a bad way, and will continue
to be so until we stop idealizing the rich. They
have no brains, no reasoning power. Why, they
-even want Glenn Frank to take over the Republican
Party leadership. And now John .IrIami1ton’s wife
has divorced him! This degradation must stop!”

“If you doiift have the rich to make ideals around,”
asked Mabel, wrmkling her forehead with the bur-
den of thought, “what will you do? Make ideals
about the poor?”

“It’s no use,” sighed the ;o1‘ofessoi‘. “Mabel, you

’ will never understand.”

“I guess not,” said Mabel. “I guess not.”

 

Buttonbagatelle

We have been mystifying people again. They

at this point, we of the pitt news, in sincere rev-

on 1‘ed-baitiiig.
I refer to the apparent

tionaries—the Daughters
American Revolution.

It isn’t like the good old days
when this group had its red cell
in almost every state legislature,
agitating for teachers’ loyalty
oaths and witch hunting in high
schools and colleges. (Of course,
I could point with a sneer at the
twenty or so states which retain
these loyalty oaths—but this is no
place for shadow boxing.

The last session of the Pennsyl-
vania assembly passed without
one concrete achievement for the
cause. And I doubt whether the
Daughters have received any di-

. rectives for the next one.

BOURGEOIS COMIC

The American Legion, another
red organization which intensifies
the class struggle in America by
constant lobbying for the veter-
ans, has also been rather reticent
lately. It still adheres, however,
to its “Third Period” line of ad-
vocacy of increased appropria-
tions for preparedness.

The former proletarian Nation-
al Republic, which hides behind
the motto, “The Magazine of Fun-

damental Americanism,” has
turned into a bourgeois comic
magazine. Only the other month

it 'oubli.sl'ied a piece entitled “Len-

SAVE DEMOCRACY

I may even have to knock the
Republican party, which has late-
ly taken a decided shift to the left
by nominating as the head of a
committee to rejuvenate the party
a red named Glenn Frank. Frank
had been thoroughly exposed by
Mrs. Dilling (a DAR) in the “Red
Network” as a communistic pro-
fessor who would bear watching
(by the DAR).

To add to the confusion, the
communists have shifted over into
the same bed with Roosevelt and
now support his "program of “col-
lective security," which means
that we ought to line up the demo-
cratic ' imperialist countries
against the fascist nations to make
the world safe for democracy. I
expect the Communist Party to
support conveying of goods to
China and more marines for
Shanghai any day now.

Why, if the DAR were really
active, it could recruit a lot of
members from the Communist
Party before that group goes over
to the extreme Right. I under-
stand that Earl Browder’s ances-
ters also came over on the May-
flower.

Little Trouble Besp

Pitt Shows Only Enough To Win

By

LEONARD LEVlSON

Sports Editor
No one ever accused the Panthers of running up a I.uisetti-

like score on so neighborly a team as the Dukes.

one ever thought of Pitt-Duke
on.e—point-difference terms.

Of course. no
ﬂoor relations in anything but

Wednesday night/s Stadium vendetta was a. slight depart-
ure from the accustomed thrill routine as the Carlson ramblers

pushed out a 35-28 victory in the¢

first skirmish of the yearly civil
sabotage.

As far as the score was con-
cerned, it was close, and a care-
less perusal might lend the im-
pression that the game might have
been enough to throw the auto-
nomic nervous system into an ab-
normal condition.

DUKES HOLD EVEN

But, such was not the case. even
though the Dukes were able to
keep the points distributed on an
even keel during the early por-
tions of the contest, there was no
anxiety as to who would be in the
top scoring position when the
game ended. Maybe, it was be-
cause we couldn’t  that Stan-

ford game with its 92 points
:against Duquesne out of our
minds.

Anyway the Panthers seemed to .
remember that little incident
them.selves and acted accordingly.
During the first quarter they just
tossed the ball around among
themselves; in the manner of a
daily practice session, except that
they hardly went to the trouble of
working out the Carlson figure
eight. .

O’Malley opened the scoring by
arching in a long shot from mid-
court. This marked one of the
two moments that the Dukes had
the lead. It didn’t linger very
long, as Joe Garcia pushed in a
set-up shot, and Captain Bob
Johnson and Eddie Spotovich ‘fol-
lowed up with mid—court swish-
ers, bringing the score to 7-2.

DUKES THREATEN

Things became somewhat stir-
ring a few, moments later as
O'Ma11ey refused to touch the rim
on a court ‘from '1 the direct side

the affair. As this happened, with
nine minutes remaining in the first
‘.1:-.lt‘, Rags Radvansky, the rugged
Pitt guard, was replaced by Bob
Johnson H., because of ‘three per-
sonals, Dr. Carlson was apprehen-
sive about the likelihood of an-
other.

After Ernie Fortney, Dukes’
center, missed two free throws,
Myles Zelenik helped the home
cause with a set-up shot from a
well executed pivot position.

ty of distance between them and
the basket: with two successive
long shots as the half ended, Du-
quesne leading, 12-11.

Immediately upon play resump-
tion in the final period, Joe Gar-
cia put things back on equal.
grounds with a successful foul
throw and it stayed that way on a
succession of long shots up to.
16-16.

. _ I.uz;".'*:<a
PANTHERS STEP OUT

At this juncture, A Radvansky
pushed one in after taking the ball
off the bankboard on Johnson II’s
missed foul. O’Malley, who was
always there when the Dukes
needed him, came through with
what turned out to be the Dukes’
last stand. It was a set shot, mak-
ing the score 18-18.

At this point the Panthers broke
out into a sweat and iced the
game away. Garcia, Zilch, Bags,
and Johnson had  scoring hand
in making  total read 23-18.
From here, with the game on ice,
the boys slipped into a comfort-
able 35-28 triumph.

From an analysis of the figures,
which really don’t provide an ac-

, bition.

the Panther courtmen off

to a. good start in the City Con-

curate diagnosis of the game, it
was impotency at the foul line that
beat the Dukes. lvith the field
goals evenly distributed at 13 for
Pitt and 12 for Duquesne, it was
the nine foul shots that won for
Pitt. The Dukes only made four
free throws out of 19 attempts.
Alike to Pitt-Duke history only
in the roughness of play, the
game showed a Bluff team far be-
low standard and a Pitt team
that didn’t show more than it had
to win, leaving its real potential-
ity still in the abstract.
In the preliminary game, the
Duquesne freshmen continued
their victory rampage by quicting
the Little Panthers, 43-24, in a
rather well-played game. Those
young Dukes lived up to all the
ice things that have been said
about them with their fine exhi-

Early Morning
Practice Slated
At Garden

John Mcsorley is determined-
to win the John Carrol ice match
next Wednesday at any costs, and
towards this end has been driv-
ing his charges at full speed all
week.

Wednesday the boys worked out
at Shadyside on ice covered V'\/J’:h
a half inch of water, but even so,
they got in a stiff workout, stress-
ing shooting. .

The date. the squad had with
Duquesne Garden yesterday was
cancelled because of Garden ac-
tivities and Pitt’s Blue and Gold
icers trained on the Stadium cind-
ers.

However, tomorrow morning
will be another story. Mcsorley
has the Garden from 8 until 9:30
o’clock and you can bet your prom
ticket that he’ll throw plenty of

A
'7

hockey for his sextets to absorb.

Pitt’s terriﬁc body checking, the
salient factor in halting the Dukes’
offense, has continued» on the up-
grade since the initial practice
following the Duquesne battle.

Bob Schooley, Taylor Britten
and Paul Kennedy are spilling for-
ward lines like ten pins. This
feature of the Blue and Gold’s
repetoire will undoubtedly place
them at the top of the league, if
not in games won, at least as the
most colorful outﬁt in the Ohio-
P e n n s y 1 V a ni a Intercollegiate
Hockey League.

The problem giving McSor1ey
nightmares these nights is the ap-
parent lack of goalies at the Uni-
versity. For the past week he has
been using defense men in the
nets and experimenting with any-
one wanting the job, but as yet
has not found a capable man to ﬁll
the bill.

Gloved bombs are expected
to explode tomorrow evening in

with a strong VV&J squad in the
opening match of the current

The Prexie boys, captained
by “Battiin” Bill Basso, a 155

heat and win what is also their
initial match of the year.

The Shrickerite aggregation,

force in the first event. Ray
Bombe, the 165-pound dread-

’ Matmen Appear
At Lancaster

Against F &M

Coach Eddie I\/Ia.zcski’s mat-
men will unlimber their pet
holds in the initial intercollegi-
ate wrestling match of the year,
tomorrow, at Franklin and Mar-
shall, Lancaster.

This is the best‘ outﬁt of
grapplers in Pitt wrestling his-
130?.‘/. according to the grunt and
goan tutor. The canvas athletes
have been observing a strict train-
ing formula and filling up their
bag of trick holds with astonish-
ing regularity. In fact, some of
the wrestlers’ bags are just drip-
ping over with fancy holds.

CAPTAIN OVERWEIGHT

Especially destructive are
back-pinning methods of Rudy
Tomarelli, flexing at 125, who is
seven pounds overweight as this
story goes to press, but who ex-
pects to weigh-in at the regula-
tion figure Saturday, Tomareui
is the newly appointed captain
and wrestled successfully to the
Eastern Intercollegiate semi-fin-
ale last mat season.

Two gridiron mighties, Clem
Cambal, 165, and Frank Kristo-
fek, heavyweight, will be serious
contenders for Eastern titles ‘this
winter. Bill Hoeveler, 118, of the
Hoeveler activity dynasty, is a
shifty grappler who pins his op-
ponents down with thuds that
crease the stiff canvas cover. Al-

inost unbelievable of a mere 118-

pounder—-but Hoeveler does just
that.
PRACTICE WELL

Larry Roofner, struggling at
145, Manny Ardalino, 135, Jim
Kosinski, 155, and Art Dimit,
football manager, 175, are Coach
Mazezki’s other strong entries in
the Franklin and Marshall match.

All ofthese muscle nzez‘. nave
shown well in practice tizfs, and
their instructor feels reasonably

‘ safe in predicting they will do

just-as well in official competition,
and set a new high for Panther
mat men.

As the chief gauge for judging

the composition of his team,
Mazezki used the intramural
tournament. It was in this af-

fair that his 118-pound represen-
tative, Bill Hoeveler, a compara-
ﬁve mat novice. turned up.

Olson Selects Tentative
Millrose Contingent

Mile Relay Team,’

Woodruff, Ryden
To Make Trip

By BILL MAZEFSKY

The ﬁve Pitt trackmen who
will pullman up to New York
on February 5 for the Millrose

lected by Coach Carl Olson. Ed
Zolnoski, Allen McKee, and
Frank Ohl are three parts of
the quartet that will run the
mile relay; Johnny Woodruff is
the fourth part. Kenneth Ryden,
hurdler, rounds out the traveling
squad.

However Olson used the word
tentative and that means Zolon-
ski, McKee, and Ohl have slight
worries if they are bent on chas-
ing around Madison Square Gar-
den’s saucer-like t'."ack that will
be the scene of the Millrose
games.

Art Thomas and A1 Ferarra are
the slight worries who have very
powerful designs about that trip.
These two are still very much in
the running for places on the re-
lay team, and stand a good
chance of being asked to pack a
valisc next month.

RYDEN INVITED

Ken Ryden and Johnny Wood-
ruff are, concentrating on their

specialties. In addition to the
relay Johnny will do the half mile v
with the country’s topnotchers.
Woodruff figures to win this race
and shear time from the record
in the process. Ryden will jack
rabbit over the high hurdles with '
the best in collegiate circles.
Meanwhile the rest of the Pan-
ther trackmen are putting in
licks for the indoor season which
will start with the University
meet. Watch Pete Bennett do
things to his 6 feet, 41/; inches

high jump records, advises Ol-
son.
Bennett, after a sensational

sophomore year had a mediocre
season. This year Pete will again
be one of the best high jumpers
in the East and should get over
3 feet, 7 inches. In addition he
is expected to garner points in
the broad jump, shot put, and
discus.

TWO VAULTERS

The pole vaulting department
will be handled by a couple of
juniors named George. The ﬁrst
one, George Clifton, reached 12
feet, 6 last year and won a letter
despite plenty of veteran compe-
tition.

This year he has skyrocketed‘

over the 13 feet mark which is
plenty high enough to win points
in most meets. The other George,
who signs his checks George
Dines, will keep the ﬁrst George
jumping for his job-——or else.

One of the sophomore contin-
gent will ease the Olson frown
when he glances over at the ﬁeld
men. Bud Hafer, erstwhile tackle
on the football team, has shifted
his activities over to the track and
ﬁeld. Hafer is a great prospect
and «will concentrate on the dis-
cus and shot put.

This Pitt track team is begin-
ning to shape up as a pretty good
thing. Olson might not admit it,
but his boys are not going to be
congenial hosts to visiting track-
men. If beating your guests, who
are in town for a little track meet
is not being very congenial, then
there will be times when the Pan-
thers are going to be down right
nasty.

WAA Schedule
Ligonier Trip
_/liter Exams

WAA has planned a perfect
cure for “Exam Fever” in its out-
ing at Laurel Ridge on January
28, 29, and 30. Leaving their
mental worries seventy miles be-
hind, the girls will have as main
inducements in helping them to
“forget” such things as skiing, ice-
skating, and ﬁreside get-togethers
in the large recreation hall.

There will be accommodations

for fifteen girls in addition to
three faculty advisers, Miss
"l‘hatcher, Miss Anderson, and

Miss Rearick, head of the Wom-
en's department of physical ed-
ucation.

Much interest has been shown
in this camp for it is to be affil-
iated with the University next
summer when classes in physical
education will be held there. The
maximum charge for the entire
week-end is $2.50 and this in-
cludes transportation, food, room,
and lots of fun. Girls planning
to go on this outing are urged to
sign up in the Women’s Lounge
on the Eighth floor as soon as pos-
sible.

Louise Baughman, who serves
as the acting student head of
WAA announces that this project
is on the order of novel experi-
ment. It is the first time in WAA
history that an event of this spe-
ciﬁc nature has been held.

Dr. Hovde, when qu.estioned by
a News reporter, made no com-

stated.

KNOWN AS LIBERAL

Dr. Hovde came to the Univer-
sity in 1927 from Allegheny Col-
lege where he was a member of

the faculty for three years. Previ- =

ously he was instructor and Act-

ing Dean of Men at Luther Col-5

lege, where he received his Bache-
l0r’s degree in 1916. He did his
graduate work at the University
of Iowa where he received his
master’s degree in 1919 and his
doctor’s in 1924.

Dr. Hovde, known as one of the
campus’ most liberal thinkers, was
appointed to his present post in
Mayor Cornelius D. Scully’s cab-
inet a yea: ago. Since that time
he has gained an ever-increasing
approval frorn the public and pub-
lic officials in the d.ist.ri.ct.

University students who have

a fact which. accounts largely for
his popularity as a teacher.

According to a feature article
in The Pitt News last year, the
writer stated: “I once heard a stu-
dent, disillusioned with life and a
flunk, murmur: ‘I wonder why I
come to school maybe just to get
Hovde’s 62 course.’ ”
