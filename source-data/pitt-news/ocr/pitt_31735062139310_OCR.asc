GLEE CLUB CONCERT       
‘ IS GREAT SUCCESS

Greeted by one of the largest au-
diences that ever turned out to Car-
-negie Music Hall, the combined Glee
and Mandolin Clubs rendered their
closing» concert of the school year
Tuesday evening.

From the opening strains of that
stirring old song “The Gold and ‘P»lue"
to the closing bars of that immortal
Pitt classic, “Hail to Pitt," the whole
program was, to say the least, highly
appreciated, as evidenced by the nuin—
ber ofencores given. ' '

Miss Ida Mae’Heatley scored a de-
cided hit when she sang “Silver
Threads Among the Gold,” accom-
panied by the Glee Club. Her other
songs were admirably rendere(l and
greatly liked, but there was that
something about her singing of that
good ol(l familiar home song that l'ool<l ‘E, M, ZERX,

‘ OF DR. LEYY’S ADDRESS

Dr. J. Leonard Levy, one of the
prominent trustees of the University.
addressed the students at the weekly
cpiivocatioii last VVednesday morning.
The subject of his address was “Ben-
jamin Disraeli." The address lasted

almost an hour, during which time
.Dr. Levy touched upon the important
ipoints in the life of Benjamin Dis-
raeli. He said in part: ‘

“Benjaiiiin Disraeli

DR. WADSWORTH. 
. With the retirement at Dr. M. 

—Wadswiorth, Dean of the School of

Mines,'one of the most popular pro-
fessors in the University is lost to the
students. In his service here he be-
came the idol of his students. His
genial kindliness, this courtesy, his

ability, won respect-and love from‘stu- ~

dents and faculty alike.‘ As a eraesullt

-2 ‘oirfihis work, the mining department

has been thoroughly organized. , The
organizer and. first dean of «this de-

partment, Dr. Wadsworth has started

a~schioolwhi‘ch will stand _as a monu-
ment to his work in the University of
Pittsburgh.’ With practically no ma-
terials with "which to build, hehas

. laid «the foundations for a school des-

tined to go a great work in Western
Pennsylvania. As .he leaves us,’-con-
gratulations ’for a most successful
regime here will b-e mingled with'the
deepest regret. Our sori-ow at his loss
will be equaled only by the -pleasure
which has been ours in assocating
with such a man as Dr. Wadsworth.

POLITICAL CLUBS.

During the last week considerable
agitation has been aroused concern-

ing'the organization of political clubs

in the University. -Two such organ-
izations are being organized now.
This movement is one which deserves

the support of every intelligent stu-l
dent. One of the great faults of the;
American college man is his lack oflduring lunch hour.

s-tudents, will prove of inestimable

A valueto the University of Pittsburgh. ,.

Nothing can be of more beneﬁt to the
college man than a thorough knowl-
edge of political conditions in his city,
state and country. V\7ithout such in-
formation, he is ignorantof a most
important side of.li-fe, one which con-
tinually touches \’him.'

But aside from any good which may
result '~t0~ the college man personally
from/siich knowledge, he owes a duty
to his country to take part in politics.
It has been charged that college men
are largely responsible‘ for the corrup-
tion ramnifying through” politics in
late generations. They, it -true,
have not shownthe interest in these
vital matters which it is their duty to

. OPEN LECTURES.

,An unusual lecture was delivered to
the students ‘in the class of Journalism
and their friends last Monday night.
The question‘ before the class, “The
Financial Page in a Daily Newspaper,”
was most ably presentedby the ﬁnan-
cial editors of -two leading daily
papers of this city. Shont talks were
also given by other well—infori;ned
men. Such meetings the students are
entirely too wont to neglect. More
informawln is given in these openlec-
tures than in any other lectures, cov-
ering the same time._ Theytfolrm an
excellent means for informing the
casual student concerning the work-
ings of adepantment, in which he has
not suﬂicient time to st‘udy.'

More of these lectures will follow
in the near future in various depart-
ments. We‘earnestly urge-the stu-

gas well not organize that defense or-
ganization of which he spoke, for it
won’t do any good. Thanking you for
the attention you have given‘ us this
year, I itrnst that our doings will con-
tinue to interestyour paper. At least
we canthank you for trying to secure

though it was not reported for youvby
our own members, and was conse-
quen-tly much changed. If you were
to add to your staff some girls as re-
porters, possibly your attitude toward
them might change.
 I *Yours truly,

Editor’s Note——Re-ference is made
by the fair «co-ed who wrote this letter
to the need of girl reporters for this
paper. We would like to state that
an attempt was made this year to se-
cure the services of the girls as re-
porters for this paper, but owing to
the attitude of the girls.toward-this
work, little could be done. They have
turned in but little news to date, and
it would appear that their help is like-

dents to take advantage of these op-,

ly to be better known by its quality
than by its quantity. We trust that

GLEE CLUB CONCERT

Clubs, and that they fulﬁlled all ex-7
pectations would be saying the least.
Perhaps the biggest hit of the even{

verses on Pitt's Profs to the time of
“Casey Jones." Ashe and Kirk of the
Glee Club gave this and only the fact
that they ran out of more verses to‘
sing ended it. p

the faculty with nothing in it that was

one-ofthe big hits on the trip, too,
especially so, as in all the different
tow-ns visited one of their citizens was
made the “hero” of this little act.

The boys in the Glee Club certainly: i

should feel recompensed for their time?
spent in rehearsing during the winter
by the pleasing reception given them.
They did good work and the audience
appreciated it by repeatedly. encoring
them. In fact, they sang all the songs
they knew and some (:11: them
