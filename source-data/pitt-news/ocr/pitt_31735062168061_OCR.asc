tion (CA: met Tuesday in their
new lounge. located in'360 Cathe-

‘ dral of Learning. According to CA

    
 
  
 

President Paul Hensler. the or-
ganization is attempting to ac-
quire an entire suite of rooms ad-
jacent to 360.

Plans for the lounge include a
variety of vending machines and a
snacking area. Hensler expressed
the hope that the lounge facility
will result in fewer students eat-
ing in the Commons Room. thus

eradicating the recent plague of .

rats and roaches there. "

Employment

Grads Face Job Scarcity

by BOB GIN G
Staff Writer

Recent articles in the N. Y.
Times, The Post Gazette, and the
Press, have given the impression
that job offers to students who are
graduating from college this year
are going to be scarcer than in the
past. The Pitt News interviewed
_ rnest S. Holmokfdirector of Uni-

: rsity Student Placement Serv-
Eice. to find out exactly what the

situation is. concerning jobs for
graduates. and M. Holmok stated

that "itis true."

Holmok told the Pitt News that
‘at present. our economy is boom-
ing. "If you get a job." he empha-
sized. "you will be paid the full
pI‘ofessiona_l price. The problem.

-as he sees it though, is that com-
panies will be more selective. The
reason that the companies are be-

,ing selective is that many are un-

sure as to whether they will re-
ceive renewals on some oftheir
contracts. and if the contracts are
cut. employees must also be re-
stricted.

Holmok emphasized that jobs
are available. but that it is going
to take a bit of looking to find them
this year. He said that like other
colleges throughout the country.
the’ University has experienced

about a ten per cent cancellation ‘

rate from the usual amount of in-
terviews conducted by business
and industry. "The companies
have lesser needs now than before
and are offering less jobs."

Policy Revisions Topic

by NANCY RUTHER
Staff Writer“
The‘Graduate Council of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) -convened on Tuesday.
March 10, to discuss revisions
in policy and recommendations
to the FAS. This council consists

, of six doctors representing dif-

ferent departments and five
graduate students. Assistant
Dean Richard McCoy presided
as chairman: '

The board reviewed a draft of
recommendation of Interdisciplin-
ary Graduate Programs to be sub-
mitted tothe FAS. They believe
"that some students who com-
plete academically sound inter-
disciplinary graduate programs
may be better prepared. to deal

. with the problems of the future

than those trained i_n a single dis-
cipline. V 1

It is recognized. however. that
interdisciplinary programs. may.

/unless carefully patterned. con-

sist of mild exposures to two or
more disciplines with no depth in

. any area and thus beunsound pro--

fessionally," Dr.  A. ' Pfeffer
(German) expressed hishope that
departments will be so structured -
as to assure control. '

Two other drafts are under con-
sideration: ,(li) Doctoral ‘Disser-*

‘ tations in,Languages other than

«English ’and_— i (2) Departmental
Descriptions‘ in? the Graduate Bul-
letinof FAS.
Teaching assistantships (TA)

and Fellowships (TFI were also
brought to fore. Dean McCoy stat-

- ed.. "We could make a-much bet-

ter and’ more constructive use of

_their talents." Though there was
 a ge_neral_agreement that Ta‘s and t

TF's are needed in all depart-
ments. basic guidelines were
deemed appropriate. '

Before adjourning the meeting.
Dean McCoy presented this ques-
tion: "Shouldwe admit and later
award degrees to students who
have not completed a Bachelor's-
degree?'f. University r_egulations

Thetproblem, as he sees it, will ,
hit liberal arts harder than it wills‘ i
hit engineering, chemistry, phys-
sics, mathematics and other re- ."_
lated fields. The reason for this, 39
he explained, is that we are living ‘ ‘
in a technocratic society, and the .
society has a greater need for peo-. 
_ple with skills to operate this type 5 '
of a society. The liberal arts prob- .
lem is not a Pitt problem, Holmok 
stressed, but is a problem which »
is found throughout the country.

a In a usual recruiting year. the
peak season has been the spring,

needed the number of new recruits _.'
it has characteristically needed ii
in the past, according to the di-_ 
rector. Some: of the reasons for ..
the lower need have been a cut-,. _

back in the aerospace industry,_'.,-.
due to a lower federal a1location,_j "
and high interest ratesifor com-ff
mercial airlines which have cut‘ :_
back their spending. 3 "

One point that Holmok empha-I 
sized was that ‘hiring should pick 3'
up in Juneor July. when they are .
sure of contracts and federal and
state budgets begin to loosen upa‘
little.‘ Federal and other civil serv-_
ice jobs are currently hard to‘ .
come by. but are expected toopen
up when the budget is revised.

 

Profs Resist War Tax

_ by DON MARBURY
Editor-Elect

A group of University profes-

sors have organized a group on

campus with the express purpose

. of resisting what they term the
governments "War Tax.“ Theor-
ganization. coordinated by David
Houston of the Economics Depart-
ment. James Holland of Psycholo-
gy Department. and William Him-
melbauer of the Graduate School
of Business-. is being called War
Tax Resistance Pittsburgh
(WTRP l. O

Ina statement published in the
Peace and Freedom News. the or-
ganizers explained their reasons
for refusing to pay their income
taxes..saying:  at .

'~‘As our government continues

al t_a,xrevenu_es to carry on its il-

legal and criminal action in Viet-
nam and elsewhere in Southeast
Asia- to go on producingvdeadly
chemical and biological weapons,
and to take part in a suicidalarms

race and; other military porgrams .

to the neglect of overriding human

needs-. many; Americans have de-

cided they can no longergin good

conscience continue to pay for
. these shameful actions."

To oppose the war WTRP sug-
gests that citizens decide to
“Peacefully break the law and re-

fuse to pay part or all of their fed-

eral taxes.” They stated that be-

sid_es the burden ofhaving to-‘col-.

The WTRP has set up a center‘
at the Resistance Office, 3601‘
Blvd. of the Allies where ‘people:

counseling. pertinent literature,‘
and tohear speakers, on Tuesdays"

and Thursdays from 1 to 4 p.m.

-On March 15-16 the organiza-
tion will be holding workshops at:
1 p.m. in Friends Peace Center_,f-
4836 Ellsworth Ave., to help‘
people decide how to resist,‘-
"whether it be by refusal of the

cise .tax for the war." they said,
"refusal to‘ pay all or part of in-._
come tax owed, claiming suffi-_.;

° a_ grant from the Richard K. Mel-
 long Foundation- The professional-
I ism demanded by Nathan Davis

manifests itself in the unusually
 high level of performance of a
‘ band that was not in existence six
 months ago and is composed main-
f4l_,v -of young musicians. The per-
_l'.-.f0i'mance was augmented great-
’ly by the excellent technical crew
WQED. especially the camera
T crew headed by Art Siegel.

Crackling with verve. vigor and
_ power. the Big Band bursts into a
‘,1 driving storm of controlled notes,
melodies and rhythm that moves
through “The Chaser” into an
“out of sight“ rendition of "Up-
'-tight.”

,"Uptight," the band slides
[smoothly into the sinuous dancer’s
f- showcase, "Velvet Touch." Gra-
Qphically depicting the sensuous-
 ness ov velvet, the five lovely

Turning the mood down again.
the band moves into Benny Gol-
sons ‘'1 Remember Clifford" fea-
turing Nathan Davis on tenor sax.
For this number. Davis handles
the difficult transition from direc-
tor to performer extremely well.

Comments concerning his per-.

formarice are limited to “You
have to see and hear it to believe
it." '

The next number. "Isus." is a
moving music-dance-poetry com-
bination spotlighting Ruth Harvin.
who expresses beautifully through
dance and recital -the agonies.
fears. trials and joys _of the Black

woman from earliest slave days-

to now. Her performance paral-
lels the structure and progression
of the music a_s it moves from ca-
cophony. to melody. to strong. dis-
‘tinctive rhythm. ,
The rhythms come in varied
from in “Afro,” written by Davis
for the dancers so that they could
display their. many‘ moves and
moods. There are three sections
to this number. . . _

1; Rock: 21 Waltz. and 31 Jazz.

‘ It also demands versatility. altert-

ness and discipline of the band
members since the transitions are
sudden and decisive.

The show ends with “Kansas
City Masher." a catchy. swinging,
crowd-pleasing piece that would
be suitable at a cabaretor house
party.

Featured soloists for the show

' were: Kenny Fisher, tenor-saxo-

phone; Ben Caliguiri, trumpet;
Tommy Lee, flute; Nathan Davis,
tenor sax; and Nelson Harrison,
trombone, and Phil Sinsikin.

Citywide Fund Drive

 "Bounce for Hearts”

Friday, February 13, is the
kickoff day for a two day,
city wide Heart Fund Drive:
“Bounce for Hearts.”

At noon on Friday, WJAS,
Phi Kappa Theta fraternity,
and Kappa Alpha Theta sor-

ority will begin collecting

money on the Pitt campus.
They will be bouncing bas-
ketballs in an attempt to
raise at least $1000.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar,

Carl DePasqua, and Buzz
Ridl will help start the cam-
paign on the Cathedral lawn.
Following the kickoff the
fund drive will proceed by

police escort downtown. Col-~

lecting will focalize at the
WJAS studios .in Gateway’
Center.

Friday night the bouncers
plan to go to local shopping
centers. Saturday morning

Ted Payne of WJAS and the ,

members of the sorority and
fraternity will bounce bas-

Aketballs and collect dona-
tions in the St. Patrick’s Day .

parade.

Fraternity coordinator, -
Doug Hoehn, hopes some of
the Irish spirit will rub off on

.Pittsburghers and they will
, give generously-  ‘- ‘ "' —

“The guys and girls will

of the Irish will be on our
side and we’ll reach our
goal.”$a .

“Often people get the
wrong idea about why we are
doing something like this,
Doug continued. My frater-
nity and Kappa Alpha Theta
feel this is a good way of
serving the community. Cam-
pus organizations are more
than just chariot races, par-
ties’ and pranks.” ,

..The “Bounce for Hearts” is

a take off from the annual i I

“Bounce for Beats” usually
held by -Sigma Alpha Mu

disbanded here, the Heart

‘ , This is the last of a three-part good-bye to the
‘University and The Pitt News. To those of you
whom I may have offended in my first two ar-
_- ticles, I meant every word I said. To those few
whom have offered me encouragement. not only
on my _last two articles, but throughout the past
three years, I say "thanks”. For those of you
who are reading on to see whomll will attack
this time, forget it.

. Althouth the past few years have been filled
 with disappointments, and I often feel like the
 ,.angry young man that wrote many critical ar-
- 7 ticles, I think I will leave here with a good feel-
'1 ing toward the people I have met. and I would
like to express some of that feeling as my “last
“ . hurrah".

When I think back years from now to the

The Trying Times             

"Never Have

So Few

for those with whom I have worked during the
past year. In my opinion. those people have im-
proved the quality of the paper much better
than I could have done.

Done So Much

For. unlike George. I am not ‘a journalist.

I DON’T believe that there is such a thing
as objectivity. and rather than hide personal bi-
ases behind the facts of a story. I feel the writ-
er should let his readers know that the entire
story; facts and all. is his or her opinion of what
happened. Only by, offering as many opinions
as possible does a paper approach objectivity.

And if differing opinions never appeared in
the Pitt News during the past year. it is be-
cause they were never submitted. not because
they were refused. The example that I can re-
call quickest is when we actually called "camp-
us conservatives" last November to find a posi-
tive reaction to President Nixon‘s nationwide
speech. Not one person could be found to write
something in agreement with Nixon.

The Pitt News has changed since I joined
as a sports writer in 1967. But one aspect of the
"old" Pitt News that I feel is missing is the
togetherness of the staff. Like the old Pitt News
Hawks.

farewell column. those Sunday mornings were
not only bouts with the opposing teams. but
with lack of sleep and hangovers as well. Pitt

Editor. The Pitt News,

I enjoyed your editorial today.
'p"Peering" To The Future‘.
Most of your points were very
good. I'm afraid. However. as
an in-State female student. I
have two objections. One is that
_you feel that all the girls here
are out for only one thing: a
guy. While I know several who
fit that description. I also know
several (myself included) who
are putting their educations first.
My friend Lynn is a good ex-
ample. Shes engaged to a guy
who is not a student here or
anywhere else——he‘s an automo-
bile mechanic, and though he
wants eventually to go to col-
lege to teach high school. Tom
is willing to wait until after the
threat of the draft has passed
him by and after Lynn (a medi-
caltechnology major) has grad-
uated. Lynn. meanwhile. would
like to get married and her par-
ents would like her to get mar-
ried. but she wants to finish col-
lege first.

out-of-staters more aware than
the home town folks." I agree
that this kind of experience is
an important part of the Uni-
versity experience. But. why is
it so impossible for in-Statestu—
dents to obtain? I am from a
suburban area: it takes" me a
half-hour by car or an hour by
PAT bus to get home. and I go
home every other weekend. so I
haven‘t broken the parental ties
as completely as I might like.
But on the whole I believe my
experience corresponds with the
one you describe. because I
live in the dorms. (In fact. I
have tried to make it clear both
to the University and to my
folks that I would sooner drop
out than commute.» And so. Mr.
Tiernan. I think you should be
calling f'or more dorms instead
of for more out-of-state stu-
dents. or protesting the huge
numbers of commuters instead
of the dearth of New Yorkers
on a campus. (Remember Jack
LaPietra, once. among other

things. President of the Com-
muter Association. _now station-
ed by the U.S. Army in _Germ-
any.i. ~.

Your second point with which
I would like to take issue is that
you feel that the admission of
so many more Pennsylvanian
students than out-of-state stu-
dents is hurting the University. ’
You say. .it's the leaving
home. the reading of two news-
papers instead of one. the
friends at other schools. the in-
dependence. the having to break
the parental ties, that makes the

"stand up for what we believe
in" (and. as Tom Smothers. once
said to his brother Dick. "It
doesn't make any difference
whether I‘m right or wrong.

Allocations Committee Clarifies Role

Editor, The Pitt News,

The Allocations Committee views with alarm the unparalleled
ignorance with which ostensible “do-gooders" approach matters of
student activities finance. The Committee has evidenced. in the
past few months, no less than ten inexcusable distortions and or
fallacies regarding the functioning of the Allocations Committee

and other student programs.

We are'writing this letter to publicly explain some of these
gross misrepresentations. ~

The first item we wish to clarify isthe statement carried on
page 1 of the March 9 Pitt News; a statement which implies that it
is the duty of Allocations Committee to “improve the formulation of
the S.G. budget." Such is not the function of this Committee. That
job rests with the S. G. executive and budget director.$a

Secondly, we wish to inform the_students on campus that: 1)
there was no “$17,000 debt" procured by the Winter Weekend Com-
mittee. The $17,000 figure cited in the Pitt News represents part of
the expenditures of that weekend. without considering any income
brought in from ticket sales. According to latest budgetary reports
available, there is a debt of approximately $2500. «This is hardly
comparable to an alleged $17.000 dollar deficit, 2: any rumor of
‘embezzlement of $3,000 by the Pitt News business staff is merely
that 4- a scurrilous rumor — until authenticated by the Director of
Student Publications through appropriate fiscal review- 3» the funds

from Alternatives, a non-functioning organization. were recalled dur-‘

ing the Committee's «mid-year review. That money has reverted
back to the Allocations Committee's account and is available for
emergency funding. 4) The Committee is still carrying on its mid-
year review. due to the unavailability of Comptroller sheets for sev-

eral organizations until recently. Six organizations are presently

under question concerning their status. i.e.. relative financial in-
activity and failure to carry out programs which the Committee

. funded. Within the next week. executives of these six groups will be

called to show cause as to why their monies should not be reverted
back to the Allocations Committees account. It might be mention-
ed inpassing that Student Government itself is one of these six.

The last item that requires clarification is the nature of the Stu-
dent. Activities Fee. We wish to make it clear that the Committee
does not arbitrarily or on its own initiative determine the Activities
Fee. Rather. the S. G. Senate. in its ratification of the various bud-
gets. determines how much must be collected. ‘and the fee is then
setaccordingly. The S.G. Senate also ratifies the specific dollar
amount stipulatedqas the '69-'70 Senate did last October 22. for the
Winter '69-‘70 term. If you will recall the letter sent along with
your Winter term invoices. you will remember that the explanation
for the necessity foran increase in the Fee was explained at that
time. A ‘ , ' .

If there are any questions concerning the status of Activities
Fee. or any othermatters of student. finance policy. the Committee
wishes to reiterate its solicitation of inquiries by any interested par-
ties. Our only hope is" that people will request information from the
horse‘s mouth. not the horse's ass. 4 —

ow Our Readers

"the university is what you make it”

try to blame it on the Univer-
sity. or American society. In
the end. however. it is our own

individual faults. for not having"

the guts — for being scared~—to
stand up to society. to our teach-
ers. our parents. our friends. and
not just tell them but show them
where they‘re wrong.

One thing I‘ve learned is this: ‘-

The University is what you make
of it. If you take onlycake cour-
ses and or cheat on assignments
or tests. you get a degree and a
few thousand dollars a year
more. If you spend all your free
time with your boyfriend or girl-
friend. you gain a mate. If you
spendall your time doing class-
work. you might gain a 4.0 QPA;
if you spend it with your fra-
ternity brothers or sorority sis-
ters. you gain some brothers or
sisters. (The size of my family is
why I'm independent — who
needs more sisters. I’ve got 5 al-
ready.»

But there are a lot of ideas‘

circulating around this campus.
There are a lot groups and lec-
turers on campus. There are a
lot of thinkers in books. maga-
zines. even the "pig press" if
you look for them. Lots of
thoughts; sometimes even on TV
(especially Channel 13). And at
a University like this. there are

also people around to talk with
about them — at least. there
should be. '

If you want to learn. the Uni-
versity is as good a place as
any (and better than most» to
begin. imperfect as it may be.
All you have to do is look around
you —— but you have to learn how
to do that on your own. because
that shows you really have it
in you: the desire to learn and
the guts to be an individual.

The University experience is
part of the experience of life;
and what you make of your life
is up to you. depending on what
you want out of life. If you want
an easy time of it. forget it; lots
of people are ready and only too
eager to put you down. and very
few (even if you can find them)

to help you up. But if you want -

to be everything that it is in you
to be. try. You may not have as
great a quantity of friends, but
they will give you a greater
quality of friendship. Youmay
not have as many dates. but
when you find someone who at-
tracts you. it will be a more to-
tal attraction and a more satis-
fying relationship. vYou might
not earn as much. but you will
have learned to enjoy more
things more fully that cost less.
and will therefore be happier.

"Freedom To Create” Stressed

In an open orientation meeting

in the Student Union Supper Room
on Wednesday. professors from
the Department of English out-
lined new proposals and new
courses in the English Depart-
ment for fall. Dr. Robert Whit-
man. chairman of the English De-
partment. spoke about the reason
for dropping the core course re-
quirements. "The English Depart-
ment wanted to get away from tra-
ditional requirements and extend
the range of course possibilities.
Our program does not emphasize
freedom from responsibility. but
freedom to do something. free-

The English Department has in-
stituted departmental advisors. as
opposed to faculty advisors. The
faculty advisors will still suggest
means of charting courses to Eng-
lish majors. but the departmental
advisors. who are graduate stu-
dents in English. will sign students
to programs.

The core of the advising depart-
ment is centered in an English
10 course. called Seminar in Lit-
erature. English 10 will be limit-
ed to several sections of ten stu-
dents each. and is planned for first
and second term sophomores. The
course will examine several dif-
ferent approaches to English lit-
erature. The faculty instructor in

Phil Wion, professor of English,
explained that, since core courses
are no longer required, the faculty
can offer new courses more easi-
ly. Satire, Romance, Romantic
Satanism, and the Age of Roman-
ticism are some of the new litera-
ture courses. Mr. Wion stated,
“The aim of these new courses is
to provide a wide selection of
study for students. Individual
study programs can also be work-
ed out, and students can set up
new courses themselves.”

For writing majors. one of two
"lower courses." English 11 or
12. is still required. A writing
major must complete 11 or 12
before going on to a 140 course.
Also. junior or senior writing ma-
jors must complete a writing sem-
inar (171 or 172i.

Professor Robert Marshall dis-
cussed departmental meetings
and and procedures. Departmen-
tal meetings are open to all stu-
dents interested in an English
major. Mr. Marshall explained.
"Any single feature of procedure
can be discussed and changed. The
system is open. whether or not
students will participate in it."

Also. according to Marshall. a
new course description system is
in effect. Loose leaf binders with
descriptions of English courses
will be available on the ninth floor
of the Cathedral in the Advising
Center and in the departmental ad-
visor’s office.

And if the expression: I think, there-

5 fare, I am, is true then these thoughts

can truly be called me, Donald Lee Mar-
bury.

. . . . . And as that representative of
poverty, that symbol of the ghetto

 ’ I _ brings a long whiskered snout into view

from its man-made haven; the old gas
oven, I grow angry. Poverty . . . .? Why

I ' us? Why is the denizen our ever com-

panions? Why must we share our lives
with him?
. . . ; . And I dream. Oh man yeh. A
house; no, ahome. A home with no in-
truder. A place where you reallyﬁhave
to be sad to sing the blues. And the
stench from the alley can’t seep
through the old crusting cement walls.
Where the paint-can won’t have to be
used to cover the cracks in the cement,
and still fail in stopping the rain water
from seeping through.

. . . . . And I look at the faces around
the classroom. And I love them, be-
cause they want to understand. They

want to right the great wrong. That '

fabulous paradox; poverty rigidly in-
-herent in one single race of people . . . .

Zdeliberately . . . . . in . . . . in the riches

country in the land.
So many things . . . . . . So many

 . . things they still don’t realize. That still
' ‘ ‘can’t feel. But. They want to know, they
-want to feel. Still hope. I. Me. I can

make you feel; make you see. We will
make you feel. You to will know. Ilove
you all.

. . . . . And you are doomed, my sleek

W — , gray adversary. We will win. We . . . . .

must win.

But I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t
‘want to kill him. They said it was my

- duty. Don’t you see? He was our ene-

my. He didn’t think like we do. Why,
death was too good of a fate for the
dirty stinkin’ damn Commiee . . . . .

_ wasn’t it? Leave me alone will you. I

did right. . . . . Iknow I did right. . . . ,
didnlt I? A man . . . . . a man just like

me. Who onced laughed, cried, loved‘

 . . ..1ived. This hand. This one finger.
One little squeeze of a man-destructer,

[and no more. No more laughing, crying,‘

loving .  . . or even breathing. Death

in a‘ rice» paddy. And in that split of a
 A -split second; a back stooping no longer
- .- to gather food, but tobecome food.

Oh God, my God. God? But an eye

‘ for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. Yeh,

that’s it. I was right. No murderer me.

 "_”‘.Ah . . . . . but no‘. THOU SHALT NOT’

I‘. .‘ . . . TIIOU SHALT NOT KILL. A
truth? Itdoes not 'say,:THOU SHALT

A That whisper: murderer murderer

Allusions to Hemingway, “Any

  man’s death dimishes me, because I

am a part of all man.” Vietnam-Death,

‘(the same. And me a henchman of the

scenities at me, I couldn’t bring my-
self to come down to his level and and

return his hate. Pity . . . . . extreme
pity pulsed through every vein in my
body. “What an awful . . . . . inhuman

feeling it must have been to hate some-
one as he hated me. Contortions . . . . .
ugly venemous hate. Why do you hate
me? What is it that I have done?” He
answered me with an onslaught of pro-
fanities. “You b'lack bastard. You’re
nothing but a no good nigger. Why I bet
you think you’re just as good as Iam."

Memories . . . . . fears . . . . . confusion
. . . . . pity . . . . . suppression‘ofjustifi-
able hate and retaliation, with the
heart . . . . . uncontrollable tears. But,

of course, who doesn’t cry at funerals?
Or at the viewing of a corpse?

SOUL IS:

Walking down by a stream on a hot
summer day, finding a stone worn
‘almost perfec'tly round by the wa-

The act of sexual’ intercourse where,

Recognizing that people are all differ-

Thinking the way -you think, because

by BOB GING
Staff Writer

At a multi—versit_v like Pitt.
many departments and courses
are often unknown to the students
for one reason or another. Such
was the case of the relatively ob-
scure astronomy department. un-
til the introduction of a new
course. Intelligent Life in the Uni-
verse. Officially Astronomy 12.
this new course is being taught by
two grad students, Bob Nelson and
Jim Hays. A

In a Pitt News interview. Nel-
son explained why the course is
different from the traditional
method of teaching astronomy.
The way the course has been
taught. Nelson asserted. was the
same way that it has been taught
for the past 35 years. The material
was brought up to date each year.
but the basic methods and em-
phasis remained the same.

The astronomylprof went on by
pointing out that since there is no
astronomy major available to the
undergraduate, most of the stu-
dents take _the course to fulfill
their. distribution of studies re-
quirement. This being the case,
he finds it much more interesting
and valuable to the students to
give them something which they

can grasp on to, and something '

that will have some relevance to
their everyday life.

The book used for the course is
Intelligent Life in the Universe,

by Shklovskii and Sagan, a Rus- ’
sian and an American, who never '

met, but wrote the book by letter.

necessary background of atron-
omy to understand their discus-
sion.

The authors have attempted to
show methods of conducting a sys-
tematic search for intelligent life.
and methods of contacting them
and the implications of communi-
cations with them if they are
found. The authors believe. how-
ever. that should intelligent life be
found. we would never meet with
them. because of the spatial limi-
tations of our methods of travel.
but that a great deal of beneficial
knowledge could be obtained from

When asked about how the stu-
dents reacted to this course.
Hayes explained that the .course
was filled a week after it opened”
and had to be reopened again to
accommodate the increased num-
ber of students who wished to take
it. Hayes. who teaches the labora-
tory half of the course. explained
that since the "kids are from all‘

to learn something they can use."

20th Century Bon. Vivant

Senior

Editor's Note: In an attempt
to get to know this year's grad-
uating class a little better, the
Pitt News decided to interview
several of its outstanding mem-

bers. Following is a feature on

one such individual, Gary Cum-
mins. Gary is the President of
the Men’s Glee Club, a former
Student Government Senator, a
‘member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa (ODK), Druids, Phi Eta Sig-

ma, and Pi‘ Lambda Phi frater-'

nrty.

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Gary Cummins is an unusual
person. He enjoys lil'e and helps
others to do the same. He lives
for himself. by his own admis-
sion, but in the process he brings
happiness to those who have the
pleasure of knowing him.

A senior pre-med student.
Gary is extraordinarily well-

rounded. He is at once a bon

vivant, a thinker, a hard worker,
a comedian. an organizer, a min-
strel, and a lover. He is sensi-
tive, -intelligent, unabashed, hon-
est, funny, and handsome. He

also knows that he is.

“I was born in a log cabin
on the hillsides of Kentucky,"
Gary drawled, at the outset of
a Pitt News interview. With
mock seriousness. he hunted
self-consciously for a profundity,
finally beaming, “A wet bird
never flies at night."

Gary, settled down quickly,
though. Capable of shifting
moods almostat. will, he admitt-
ed that he considers himself an
unusual young man. “I've cast
off a lot of inhibitions that peo-
ple usually get hung up over,“
he explained.’ ’ "L '

Speaking candidly, the Johns- '

town native said. he thinks all
men should strive to enjoy them-
selves while alive. “That can
apply to anybody,” he opined,

noting that different people can’

enjoy in different
ways.

"What satisfies you the most,
you should do," Gary declared.
"What, satisfies me the most is
getting a broad experience." he

added, expressing_a personal pre-

themselves

' ference for variety.
,Gary finds that “intellectual

achievements and pleasures are
much more rewarding and long-
lasting than physical ones."
But he points out that "not ev-
erybody has the capacity to. be
satisfied intellectually."

While admitting that there is
a strain of autocracy in his
character, he argues that this
prejudice has been corroborat-
ed by experience. "If you want
anything done right, do it your-
self," he intones and means it.

He is willing to change, how-
ever, if he can be convinced
that he is wrong. “The story of
my life can be‘ read on my
Chemistry lab cards,” he com-
ments. “RECALCULATE.”

Looking back over his four
years at Pitt, Gary noted some
mistakes. "It I had it to do
over again." he remarked. “I
would take a larger range of lib-
eral arts courses. Unfortunately.
as a pre-med major. I restricted
myself pretty much to the sci-
encesI'

Gary did. however. take a
number of Philosophy courses.
and he is especially pleased
about that. “Taking Philosophy

has had the most profound effect '

on my life. In Philosophy 39. for
example. I learned four- or five
different ways to value something
ethically. I think the course

' should be- a requirement. It per-'
éople 'a :-more.

(ta-ins to?‘ more-ip

direct way than any other one.
and that includes English."$a
..Turning to broader aspects of
educational reform. Gary argued
that "there‘s no reason why you
should have to go to college for
four years." Ideally, he main-
tained, "the college experience
should last as long as the indi-
vidual feels it should, and ought
to include learning and working
in different fields. " '

He conceded, however, that
"society must de-emphasize the
hurry in life and the need to
make money immediately" if his
proposal is to be workable. Blam-
ing capitalism for fostering a
distorted system of values. he
declared, "I can go along with
competition it the goals, are ac-
ceptable. But the goal of busi-
ness should be to make the best
productand not the most mon-
ey. And the aim of society

should be to produce the best
people, not the richest people.“

Gary doesnot believe in gett-
ing too distressed about any-
thing, but he doesn't deny'that
several things annoy him. "I
still get bothered when you go
places an_d people expect you to

V say the right thing."

He also objects to “people
people without

sufficient information .’ . like

someone who sits down and cri-—

ticizes the Chancellor without
knowing why he acts’ the way
he does. People tend to pass em-
otional judgments right off the
bat, but they really shouldn’t.

It is precisely becauselGary
recognizes his own limitations

and the inadequacies of his own.

knowledge that he refuses to
tolerate glib comments when oth-
ers make them.

This in fact is his major com-

plaint. “People don’t really think
enough,” he stresses. “They ac-

cept too many things. They
haven’t ‘thought about why the
do the things they do.” ’

Quoting from a diary he has
kept while at Pitt, Gary express-
ed his determination to reject
this approach. “Reason with
those who won‘t," he read.

 

"Ask them why they think the
way they do. If they have no
logic, call them folls, for that's
what they are.“

As he leafed through the pag-
es of his diary, Gary came ac-
ross another favorite entry: “For
a man who lauds his character.
may he give due thanks to his
parents."

In spite of his self-confidence,
Gary does appreciate what oth-
ers have done for him. Mention-
ing Doctors Grunbaum and
Schneewind of the Philosophy
Department as men who have
helped him immensely, he urged
all students to know outstanding
professors. "Teachers are very
willing to see students,“ he not-
ed from experience, "and they
are the most fascinating peo-
ple,"

What qualities does Gary most
admire in others? “Intellectual
capacity, an appreciation of the
arts, and initiative.” The first,
he feels, is “directly related to
a sense of humor.”

And what advice does he give
to Pitt underclassmen? "Experi-
ment your first couple years, try-
ing everything. Then find a
niche and settle down.”

Gary’s own niche has been
the Men’s Glee Club, of which
he is the proud President. “The
Glee Club allows me to use my
talents and satisfy my inter-
ests,” he declared. “It’s truly a
great organization.”

An inveterate showman and

.irredeemable ham, Gary confid-

ed, “Myhappiest moments are
when I’m in front of a group,
which is one of the reasons why
I love being in the Glee Club.”
With a laugh and a twinkle in
his eye, he recalled the occasion
when he tried to direct Hail to
Pitt at a concert, only to blush
as the accompanist played Tea
for Two. “I guess there were
embarrassing moments too.”

.~..-



Gary gets frustrated and de-

pressed at -times. He often‘ asks
himself the same fundamental
questions he thinks others don’t
ask enough, and he doesn’t al-
ways come up with conclusive
answers. ~

Still, Garyls search for person-

al happiness has_ been rather suc—.
'-cessful. Indeed, it does not seem

absurd to characterize him as_
nearly the epitome of the suc-
cessful 20th century man.$a

He is not without his prob-
lems, to be sure. But he does not
let them overwhelm him or dis-
turb‘ him for long. Instead, he
smothers himself‘ in the pathos
of song or pokes fun at reality
with a witty sentence or a fro-
licsome gait.

Most importantly, Gary refus-
es to admit defeat. The world is
moving quickly, .but he has
grasped it by the tail and now
clings to it with all his strength.
A human being has actually tri-
umphed today,

The Pitt News is the greatest
college E newspaper in the coun-
try. Oh, you don’t think so? Then
join us and make it that. If you
dothink so, don’t you want -to ‘be
a part of it? Come up baby; 4th

floor  we want you.‘

Matmen Set For

Adams Shows Cautious

Optimism Before Meet

By MIKE MILLER

Dave Adams is looking forward to the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Wrestling Championships with his usual cautious op-

timism.

“I wouldn’t say were one of the strong teams."
"but I hope we do better than last year."

The mat squad will be handi-
caped by the absence of last
heavy weight champ
Ralph Cindrich. Cindrich has
missed the entire season due to
a football injury.

Mark Payne, kept out of last
years tournament by a sudden
illness, will compete but, “He is
not one-hundred percent,”
cording to Adams. Payne has
been nursing an injury for sev-
eral weeks. Adams was uncer-
tain about Paynes performance
in last week’s Army match.
Payne, however won a 5-3 de-
cision over’ Army's Bill James,
wrestling on what Adams called
“intestinal fortitude alone.”

Buddy Morris and Pat Lavery
both remain on the injury list
and will not wrestle. Sophomor-
es Bud Smeltz 150 and Joe
Schantz (158) will get their first
taste of Eastern tournament
action-and Adams terms them as
“darkhorses.”

Two other sophs. Dave Wylie
and Dave Young, will also be
seeing their first Eastern action.
Wylie has shared the duties at
134 with Scott Ross during the
regular season and he has a big
upset over Lehigh’s Larry Icen-
hower under his belt.

Young. meanwhile. will face
a field of big, experienced hea-
vyweights including Lehigh‘s
Gary Leinberger. who beat him
in a dual meet. Young weighed
in at 190 in the Army match last
week, while most of the tourna-
ment heavyweights are well over
200 pounds.

BOBBY KUHN is shown in action here with one of the East's top wrestlers, Lehigh’s Jack Bentz. Bentz
is going for his third straight Eastern crown, but Kuhn won't face him in the tourney. Bob moves
down to 158 for the Easterns, where his toughest competition will undoubtedly come from Temple's
Wallny Strosser and Navy’s Bob Christianson.

Senior Paul Allen (8-5-1) has
wrestled at 177, 190 and heavy-
weight during the season, but
he’ll be going at 177 this week-
end. Allen will face a host of
outstanding wrestlers, including
Syracuse’s undefeated Vinnie
Paolano and Navy’s all-Ameri-
ca Ben Welch.

Payne and Kuhn will also
meet some very distinguished
competition in their respective
weight classes. Colgates Tim
Hart (13-2). Cornell's Ben Bishop
(11-3). Franklin and Marshall's

Andy Noel (6-1). Syracuses
Jim Schenk (6-2) and Navy’s
Lloyd Keaser (6-2) are the top op-
ponents. Keaser has been Paynes
toughest opponent this season
and Adams feels that he will be
the toughest opponent Payne will
face in the tourney.

Temples Wally Strosser. the
defending Eastern champ. and
Navy's Bob Christianson will be
the top threats for Kuhn at 158.
Strosser has already beaten Kuhn
this season in a dual match.

Overall, Adams feels that Navy

will come out on top. I think that
Navy will win, but I don’t think
that you will see the dominance
this year that Navy showed last
year)’

Penn State has the advantage
in that they have beaten all of
the other teams and they will be
wrestling at home. They will be
hard to knock out of their.

"The Ivy Leagues are strong-
er than usual,” he continues.

‘ and they will probably knock
some people out of there and
they may surprise some people."

Undefeated State: ‘

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Dave Adams takes a injury-
riddled. inexperienced. squad
into the Easterns at Penn- State
tonight as the matmen hope to
better last year's ninth place fin-
ish. Ralph Cindrich and Bob
Kuhn picked up most ‘of the
grapplers 21 points last year.
but Cindrich will not wrestle
this year. Overall. the East
boasts some exceptionally strong
wrestlers in all weight classes,
and the Pitt News prognostictor
sees the outcome this way:

118

Penn States Dave Weber and
Franklin and Marshall‘s Chris
Black post identical 9-0-1 marks
on the season. and they should
battle it out in the finals. Black
beat Weber in the Navy plebe
tournament last year and look
for him to come out on top
again. Others who should make
it interesting include Colgates
Pete Achilles (12-B). Rutgers‘
Dennis Smith (10-1). Colum-
bia's Roger Campbell (7-3-1).
Army‘s Scott Patten (8-6-1). and
Navy‘s Tom Schueler (7-2).

126

Lehigh‘s Dick Meyer (6-2-1)_

should win here. but hell re-
ceive tough competition from
Navy‘s Lew Mason (8-1) and
Army's Mike Mullady 10-4. who
moves down from 134 for the
Easterns. Colgate also boasts a
strong contender in Steve Schrie-
ber. who stands 13-1-1 ‘on the
year.

134

Defending champ Dale Stahl
from Navy returns to defend his
title and he's lost _ only one
match ,_on the. year, ,_t_hat to a
strong 'op'ponent’ from Oklahoma.
Look for Stahl to repeat, while

the other places will be up for
grabs

among Princeton's ’ All
Uyeda, who finished second to

 

‘ SOIL

Stahl last year, Army’s Bill
James, Lehigh’s Larry Icenhow-
er, and Pitt’s Dave Wylie. Wy-
lie has already beaten Icenhow-
er this year, and he could place.

142

Mark Payne is the matmen‘s
best hope to grab top honors.
and he should be seeded num-
ber one. His toughest foe will be
Navy‘s Lloyd Keaser. Whom
Payne beat with a takedown in
the final eight seconds in a
dual match early this year.
Payne has been injury plagued
all season. but if he holds up
physically hell win. Others who
could sneak in are undefeated
Tim Hart from Colgate. Jim
Schenk of Syracuse. Jay Lee-
man from Lehigh. Ben Bishop
from Cornell or Andy Noel. F
and M.

150

Penn States Clyde Frantz has
to be the favorite here. Frantz
won the outstanding wrestler
award in last year’s Easterns
and hes having another great
year at 9-0-1. The tie on his
record came with Navy Bob
Christianson as Frantz moved
up to 158 for the match. If any-
one has.a chance to beat Frantz
it will be Lehigh’s Herb Camp-
bell. who's 11-2. F and Ms
Doug Ward (8-1-1); Colgates
Rick Koenig (11-1) and Army‘s
Bill McBeth will vie f'or places.

158

Bob Kuhn placed" fourth in
last year’s tournament and he
should improve on that, coming
off an excellent 12-2 dual sea-
One of those two losses
came at the hands of Temple’,s.
Wally Str.osser (11-llgand Stross-,.~

another

167

Penn States Andy Matter has

to be considered the favorite in
the 167 class. Matter is 10-0 on
the year. and has already de-
feated Lehigh’s All-America

‘Jack Bentz handily. Bentz. who

is going for his third straight
Eastern championship. may move
up to 177 to avoid Matter and
if he does. Steve Shields. 9-1-3
fine Lehigh grappler.
will be Matters top threat. A
dark horse candidate could be
Harvards Mike Farler (15-0-1)
but it will take a great effort
to beat Matter.

177

This could be one of the
strongest divisions in the tour-
ney. especially if Bentz moves
up. With Bentz going for his
third straight title. he'll have ex-
tra incentive. but Syracuses
Vinnie Paolano (9-0-1) can beat
him if he's in top shape. Anoth-
er very strong contender is Na-
vy's all-America Ben Welch.
who was fourth in the Nationals
last year. F and M has a strong
entry in undefeated John Stev-
enson (10-0) and Paul Allen
could sneak in for a place if he
has a good tourney.

Kappa Sigma Wins Title Another "Big 33’ Star

By Beating Law Casgrs Gridder Among Latest .

by MARTY HETLMAN

After two months of action and
over 150 intramural basketball
games. Kappa Sigma fraternity
emerged as the all-campus cham-
pion. b_y sporting the only unde-
feated record.

In Tuesday nights champion-
ship contest. the Kaps soundly
whipped the Law School Casers.
51-53. The victory gave the
champs a perfect 11-0 mark.

The squad. winners of the tough
Fraternity “B" League. had little
trouble in putting away the strong
lawmen. They controlled the game
the entire way. especially in the
second half. when the Kaps in-
creased_a six point halftime mar-
gin to an insurmountable lead.

The Kaps took advantage of
many turnovers and bad passes by
the Casers throughout the game.
The Casers, a good ball-handling
club in previous matches, were in-
duced into the costly mistakes by
hustling Kappa Sigma defense.

The real story of the game took
place at the foul line. The champs
capitalized on 19 of 25 free throws.
many of them coming in the final
minutes. In contrast. the Casers
found the charity stripe unfriend-
ly. able to cash in on only three of
12 bonus attempts.

Ken O‘Keefe. the Kaps out-
standing forward. hit for 16 points
to pace the team. Casers coach
Lee Roberts commented. "His ag-
gressive ballplay really hurt us."
The top man in the rebound de-
partment was the Kap.s Walt Vuk-
manik. '

High scorers for the Casers
were Greg Sturgeon and Mike
Yurcheshen, each netting nine
points.

On Monday night. the Kappa
Sigs won the right to meet the
Casers for the championship by
beating the Electrical Engineers.
60-55. in a double overtime con-
test.

In the closest game of the en-
tire season. the Kaps overcame a
five point halftime deficit to tie
the match with less than two min-
utes remaining. O'Keefe and John
Burpy led the rally against a good
shooting Engineer squad. Ron
Hanselman and Frank Schawber-
ger kept the Electrics in conten-
tion.

With the score tied and only
five seconds remaining, Schaw-
berger canned a drive shot which
seemed to assure the Electrics a

victory. After a time-out, Greg
Reinsel threw a length of the court
pass to O’Keefe, who swished a
15-foot turnaround jumper as time
ran out.

Each team got one field goal in
the first overtime. The Engineers
again narrowly missed winning
when a tipped—in shot went through
right after time had run out.

A steal and subsequent layup by
Burpy assured the Kaps of the win
in the second overtime stanza.

Xecause of Greek Week next
weekend. the Kappa Sigs will be
unable to represent Pitt in a local
college tournament. Indiana of
Pennsylvania. Duquesne. and St.
Francis are all entering their re-
spective intramural champs in the
tourney to be played at St. Fran-
cis next Friday. Therefore. the
second place finishers. the Law
School Casers will play.

To Sign Intent Letter

Two more area high school football stars have signed letters of in-
tent to play under Carl DePasqua and his assistants.

Jim Stein. _a 6-1. 185-pound split end and defensive halfback from
McKeesport High School. and Dave Dunbar. 6-2. 195-pound end from

Keystone Oaks. are the latest recruits.

Stein is a member of the Penn-
sylvania Big 33. the seventh from
that group to decide to come to
Pitt. He is a three—year letterman
and was captain of the McKees-
port squad during his senior year.

Stein was also named to the
West Conference all-star team for
hlS play during his final season.

He caught 44 passes on his way
to the honor and scored nine touch-
downs.

Dunbar. who‘s father is a Pitt
graduate. lettered at Keystone

Oaks f'or two years in football and
was also named to the All-West
Conference team.

He is a three-team athlete. He
lettered in basketball and track
for three years in high school.

Stein and Dunbar are DePas-
qua‘s tenth and 11th recruits this
spring. putting the coach far ahead
of last years pace. He has indi-
cated that he is aiming at more
than 30 gridders for next fall‘s
freshman team.
