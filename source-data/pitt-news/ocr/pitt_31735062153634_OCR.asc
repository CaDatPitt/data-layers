men of the freshmen class are chosen

The Pitkin Club will close-_ its year’s
work with a production of a pageant
in the chapel -of Shadyside Presby-

Pao-ting-fu, China, defending the
women members of the Congrega-

of. the season, and pitched masterly
ball, giving only three ;hits.‘» He struck
out eight men, and this coupled with

the good playing and hard work of his

teammates, kept the score down to
two runs. Kennedy looks like a good
man’ and more will be heard from him
in the future.  A V V * . ’
V The entire team hadithe batting
fevcr, garnering twelve hits. Beattie
led his _ teammates, = making three

singles, but was closely followed by

Forney, who made a double and a
home run, and ‘I-Iastings with two
single:s.- De sHart was the only mem-
_ebr of the Pitt squad who was unable
to connect with the »ba.ll.= .

The men« all "played areal- baseball
and handled all of their chances, with
the exception of a hard one by Hast-

ings and one by Kennedy, without a ‘
slip-up. Matson played a good game e

in the backsto‘ps_, position, miaking ten
putouts without an error. 4

Before the largest -crowd that ever
witnessed a Varsity tennis match, the
-Penn State quartet. easily won out
over their ‘Gold and Blue opponents
by the one-sided score of 5 to 1; an-
nexing wins in both the double match-
es and‘ taking three out of four in the
singles. The play of the Pitt racquet-
eers showed an improvement over
thei.rj*previous work of the year, but

. the work of. the experienced State

men proved to be too ‘much forthe
less exNperiencedPittites=. A 1 A
;The/ most interesting match of the
afternoon was the ﬁght -between Love,
of State, and »S(pinVdl,er, of‘ the local
team. The Pitt man took the ﬁrst

4-6. The ﬁnal set Went to Spindler
6-1. Both -players fexhi~.bited‘ a fine’,
brand of. tennis and the spectators
frequently apiplaudedf Q i ' A '

The ‘interest shown by the students
in this» brand of athletics was surpris-
ing,’-considering the fact that 11-oticeof

the matches was not given until the

last, moment. . Yesterday the ‘team-
lined up against the Plaid representa-
tiveson the Tech courts, -and it was

expected that they will make a better .

showing than; they did against the
Center Countians. V «All the men on the’
team with the exception of Haines
have several -more years V of Varsity
competition. With [this material
around‘ which to build up a team, big
things: should‘ be looked for next year.
It is hoped that the University tennis

courts will «be -available by that time .

and elimination tournaments can be
staged on a bigger plan than they were
this year. — N

The local chapter of the Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity combined with Y the
Pittsburgh Alumni Association made
an auto pilgrimage to Bethany, W.
Va., the birth-pla.ce”of the Fraternity.
‘ The‘ Pittsburghers passed through

tWashington, Pa., where they’ were

joined by Gamma Chapter of W. & J.
Upon the arrival at Bethany, the
delegation was met by a large num-

ber of Delts from neighboring towns,

and two of the original founders.
Dinner was served in ‘ the Bethany
lclhristian’ Church, after which the
party was escorted‘ through the col-
lege buildings by President Cramblett,
who was also vamember of the old
chapter at .Betihan’y. , , r

The house where the Fraternity was
founded is still standing. and the en-
tire delegation crowded the house to
listen to the ceremonies. Attorney

James A. Wakeﬁeld presided -and after:

The Fraternity was founded at
Bethany in 1859, but died out in 18:61,

wlgfén the insfitution -closed ‘its doors ‘

due to the Civil War. It was revived
for a. short time after the war, and
during this time there-was a. chapter
st-arted at Jefferson College now Wash-
Jeff, which at the present time is the
oldest continuous chapter of the Fra-
ternity.

G‘ The old‘ homestead and study of

Alexander Campbell, the founder of

the Disciples Church, and also one of
the -fraternity founders was a point
of interest for the visitors. The
house is at present occupied by Camp-
bell’s daughter, who entertained the
party with many interesting stories

P__,‘of the early days of tire Fraternity,’ ,
and the sftirrlngotimes during the Civ-L A

his mind. These ideals are winning
