career: You get your undergraduate
degreein a field. and then your Mas-
ters degree and eventually your
Ph.D. Perhaps. along the way. you
work in the field. Finally. you teach
it.

Well. Dr. Trevor’Melia.~ of the
speech andcommunicationsfdepart-
ment. did his undergraduatework in
chemistry and metallurgy. H_e
worked as an industrial chemist.
then as a music teacher. a pilot and a
ﬂight instructor. For the last 10
years. he’s taught Rhetoric in a Free
Society. among other courses. at the
University of Pittsburgh. _

According to Melia. the bottom
line is simply that he likes to teach. “I
regard myself primarily as a
teacher.” he said. “What I teach is in
many ways secondary."

This love of teaching shows in his
work. Each term. three days a week.
Melia stands before 400-plus stu-
dents and tries to persuade them
about persuasion. He succeeds so
‘well that in l980. students chose him
as oneiof the l0 best teachers in the
university. ‘ .

To Melia. however. his popularity e
stems from his subject-~ persuasion
in modern society. “I teach a rela-
tively ‘sexy‘course... and l think that
it’s not a terribly difficult trick to
come off rather well.

“Those awards should be going to
.the poor s.o.b’s who are teaching
classics or-Chinese or one of those
subjects which is terribly difficult to
make interesting and draws rela-
tively few students.“ he said.

Despite his modesty. as a profes-
sor in communications. the English-
born Melia is no stranger to the
techniques taught in introductory
public speaking courses. His lectures»

are well-outlined. and he embeds
anecdotes. topical examples and
fraternity jokes into his analyses of
advertising techniques or Hitler‘s
rhetorical successes. The crowd of
400‘ even the fraternity members-
all laugh...and pay attention,

Melia does realizre that the large
sire of his Free Society class poses
the problem ofimpersonality. but he
sees some advantage in this.

“I think it’s frequently the case
that students are graduating into
massive organizations.» They may
learn a damn sight more at a place
like Pitt about how to’ get along in
modern mass society than they
might at a smaller institution."

Whenever possible. Meliartries to
consciously use the size of.the class
as an advantage. Since he discusses
mass persuasion in the class. he
sometimes tries to demonstrate the
effect that he’s describing.

“l will talk about the extent to
which people will react in collectivi-
ties and show them the reaction to
Hitler and how contagious it seemed
totbe. Then lwould finish by making
some humorious comment. If I get
lucky. they allvapplaud. Then I‘m
able to say ‘...Look you’re doing it
yourself at this verv moment.‘ “

Melia does miss, however. the stu-
dent-teacher contact that is a part of
smaller classes. Even so. he does get
to know some students.

“The students really have been
good to me. Since I make nasty com-
ments about modern music. they
dragged me to the (Bruce) Spring-
steen concert.” he said.

Melia now uses his experiences at
the concert as an example ofa mass
movement in his classes.

Such combinations of the practi-
cal .and the theoretical are what
interests him in rhetoric.

“Rhetoric has its theoretical
aspects. but there is a very long tra-
dition of rhetoricians notjust simply
talking about but getting deeply
involved. That fits very well with my T
lifestyle.“ ' ’

In order to observe rhetoric in use.
Melia has, besides going to the
Springsteen concert, played piano in
a mission in Anchorage. joined a
political campaign and even joined
basic training.

Melia. worries about the large
number of opportunities available
to watch persuasion operating.

“What academics have done.
what people like me have done. is
(that) we have sold our knowledge to

itary agencies and whatever. The
citizens oftoday are faced with abso-
lutely awesome capabilities for per-
suasive manipulation.” he said.

ln the foreword to his recently -

published book. The Luci/"er S!ate.~
Melia describes the two sides’to the
story of rhetoric--learning how to
persuade and how to detect persua-

sion. He aeknowledges that, iiwhiile‘ V

trying to teach a student the latter;
he or she may instead learn the
former. . D . I 0
— “it is inevitable that some people

will think in terms of applying and i

using rather than simply under-

standing or defusing other people‘s 0

rhetoric.” he said. «
“What (teachers of‘ rhetoric) ar
bound to do is to make sure that
students goout with a very thorough
understanding of the range and

manipulated. That represents some
sort of defense." A

As might be expected from some-
one . with such varied interests.

weren’t any records to detail the

“We didn‘t have any'documenta-

After a series of negotiations
between the university and the
government, that sum was eventu-

which was paid up—front in cash, and
the remainder coming from a reduc-
tion in future overhead payments
associated with federally sponsored

from happening again here or atany

“To do that
develop a very elaborate system that
ties in with your payroll system,”
Freeman explained. '

A “You have to show that these peo-

ple actually earned their pay and
they were actually paid fromthat ,

account and that accounted for so

‘‘It’s a very complex system, and
it‘s.taken enormous. time and effort
to develop becauseit requires chang-
ing your employment record forms
and the program by which you pro-
cess all kinds of things,” Freeman
said. . .

_ 'How much time and effort will it
eventually. cost the university to
comply with A-2|?

Between $1.5 million and $2 mil-
lion over the next three years. the
administration calculates.

‘ The other major part of A-2|.
asset management. is equally eon-

fusing. Basicallyiwhat it does is gives

the university a return on previously

*purchased equipment which is being

used in a federally sponsored pro-
ject. An example is laboratory
equipment.

But in order to get-the return on a

previous investment, the university ,

has to know where the equipment

came from, what was paid for it. for

what it is to be used, where it is
located,Vwhat the depreciation sche-
dule oniit is, “and'a whole bunch of
things which we have never main-

because of the system.

So if A-2l is causing more prob-
lems than it's worth, why bother‘?

For starters, ‘if the university

goodbye to federal support;

“We have $70 million in research
contracts; so what’s it worth’? lt’s
worth $70 million because we can-
not continue to get research con-

federal government has this require-

Monday's Senate Council meeting,

Graduate School of Public Health,

channels. _

the faculty concerns because the»

Honest Efforts

The clouded future of Pitt’s geography department
provides yet another example of a disturbing attitude
on the part of this university's administration.

In November I976. Faculty of Arts and Sciences’
Dean Jerome Rosenberg asked the Senate Budget
Policies Committee to evaluate the geography
department. V

The committee found the department to be “impor-
tant” to the university. and recommended a new chair-
man be found to replace Hibberd V.B. Kline. who was.
at that time. planning to retire.

A search process and interview period was con-
ducted during the I978 and I979 winter terms.
According to Rosenberg, the search committee found
several suitable candidates. but‘all refused to accept
the chairmanship position.

In March I980. Rosenberg presented a plan that
called for the merger of the geography department
with another FAS department. This “termination
proposal." as it was referred to in the department.
aroused considerable opposition from both faculty
and students within the program.

By March I981. Rosenberg again called for the
merger of the department and advised faculty
members not to accept any new students.

As of last week. the Graduate Student Organizatiou,_
of the department of geography brought‘an academic
integrity grievance against Rosenberg. They charged
him with “arbitrary and unfair treatment” in his han-
dling of the geograp'hy'sit'uation. -

Whether or not the geography department at Pitt is
‘worth keeping. particularly at the expense of other
programs, is not the issue here. What is troubling is the
university‘s approach to the situation.

It has been clear for some time that the increasing

costs of running a university accompanied by the pros-
pect ofvdeclining enrollment along withistagnant state
aid has made budget-cutting an unpleasant fact of life
at Pitt.
c Recent trends in budget and program planning,
such as this summer’s Lake View conference. show
that the university is attempting to come up with a
coherent policy for dealing with its tight fiscal
situation.

In view ofthese facts. and considering the manner in
which the geography department has been treated. we
are forced to question the attitude with which the
university approaches the issue of tight money and
program reduction.

Rosenberg and planners within the FAS must have
felt that the geography department was expendable
years ago. and yet. like so many other touchy topics.
they chose to cloak reality in a series of deceptive
euphamisims and false promises.

Why is it so difficult for the university administra-
tion to admit to a difficult situation‘? A more honest
attitude might prompt a more cooperative effort on
the part of students and, faculty to heIp_soIve the
serious problems that confront all of us.

Instead. a combative and hostile situation has deve-
loped that will leave neither side happy nor satisfied.

The university administration has been criticized in

» these pages for possessing an unnecessarily corporate

attitude towards its staff, faculty and students. Once
again. we are faced with the consequences of this

A attitude.

Times are tough, as most anyone will readily admit.
but one might ask what function is served by com-
pounding the problemvwith deceit.

It was not yet a godly hour. I was
still groggy with sleep. not entirely
‘sure whether I had really heard the
doorbell or had merely dreamed it.

I was exasperated. I don't think
clearly that early in the morning. I
hadn't even had my coffee. “Put the

said. “What the hell am I goingto do
with a tank?"

“It‘s up to you. lady."‘said the
delivery rnan. “Plant petunias in it
for all] care. Where do you want the
ICBM?”

“Good Lord!" I breathed. seeing
forthe firsttimethe size ofthe mons-
ter. “What am I going to do with
that?"

“Safer!” I exclaimed. “You’ve got
to be kidding. When the neighbors

see this thing, they'll have a fit.

They'll be scared to death.
Besides, it's hideous.” I had an
anxious thought. “Do the Russians

“Well. what is it‘.”’ I asked. I could.
I thought longingly. be in my bed.

its assorted‘ manifests and invoices.
“One XMI Abrams tank One Min-

marine with Tridcnt ,missle. One

ma ‘a m. "

“I didn't order that.” I said. "I

don't want that stuff."

But the delivery man was stub-

thorn. “Paperwork says you did
ma‘am. You paid for it. remember.
It’s right here. $l l.8 million for the
tank. $40 million forthe ICBM. $l.I
million for the sub and another l0.5
milion for the missle. And- a
bargain—--just ten bucks for the tank

“Well. I don‘t want them." I saidl
firmly. I’m a greatbeliever in firm-
ness with salespeople and telephone
solicitors.

“Look. lady." said the delivery»:-
man. "I'm only doing my job. see‘?
They told me to deliver this stuff. So
will you pleasejust sign here and tell
me where to put it?"

“Well. I’m not going to sign for

something I didn’t‘ordér." I said.

“Well. where shall I put ‘em‘.”’

asked the delivery man.

The delivery man was interested
in the problem. “I‘d sink it in the
front yard. ifl was you." he offered.
“You can change the targeting
around any way you want. Each of

‘these warheads will hit just a few.

yards from the target." He spoke
with the pride of special knowledge.

“I don't want it in my front yard,"
I said. “You’d have to dig up my
tomatoes. and I’d rather have toma-
toes than a missle."

“Lady." said the delivery man
irritably. “do you realize how much
safer you are going to be once this
missile is in?"

“Saferl" I exclaimed. “You've got
to be kidding. When the neighbors

ious thought. “Do the Russians
know I've got it?" '

“Oh sure." said the delivery man.
“They've got satellite reconnais-

“Well. get it out of here." I
screamed. “I don‘t want to be some-
body‘s target! Nor will my
neighbors!"

“Hey. calm down. No one‘s going
to hassle with you with that in your
front yard.“ he said.

“I will not have it in my front
yard.“ I said slowly. with heavy-
handed and exaggerated patience.

“You must be crazy. I wouldn‘t

threaten to use that thing. not and
get blown up myself."

“Yeah. he said. “but you‘d still : A

have your submarine.”

“Oh my God!“ I said. seeing it
resting on a wheeled platform.
“Listen. I‘ve got no water except in
the bathtub. Take it back."

“We'll dig a pool in the back." he
said. “You’d better have it. With all
that hardware out front. you won‘t
be safe unless you‘ve got some stra-
tegic force in reserve. And if the
neighbors complain." he said. “give
‘em ailittle whiff of thisgnerve gas.”

It was too much. “Get out of

“No way. lady." he said pulling

EAST RUTHERFORD. NJ.-
The lethargic shell that had engulfed
the Pitt Panther football team for
two games, that had rendered a once

reckless. emotional team into a pus-

sycat of an outfit. was broken on
Saturday in Pitt’s 47-3 whitewashing
of Rutgers at Giants Stadium.

The young Panthers. who it was
generally agreed could not play
without emotion to mask their
youth and inexperience. rediscov-
ered that needed Umph.’ in a big
way.’

Having come dangerously close to
losing everything there is worth los-
ing in college football. Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill kicked his team in the
rear and made them make things
happen. V S»

Even in the first ‘quarter, where
they showed the lingering effects of
the past two weeks, Sherrill’s squad
blitzed. finished their tackles and
even got into a few scrapes. Feisti-
ness had returned. _

But feistiness does not win foot-
ball games. and for 22 minutes the
Panthers were doing their best not to
win Saturday’s game.

After a Bryan Thomas 33-yard
run was wasted by a muffed field
goal attempt early in the first quar-

‘ter. the Panthers resumedithe unin-

spired performance that had charac-
terized their surpriseingly closewins

EAST RUTHERFORD. N.J.--~
Their path to Saturdays “Starting
22" had been filled with obstacles
that appeared so steep that a smart
better would have been foolhardy to
bet against the obstacles. One had
gone down in the first game losing a
starting job to a freshman whose
performance on national television
made him the next coming of Hugh
Green. and had to fight to get hisjob
back. '

The other wasn’t even in the pic-

-ture come opening day. A knee oper-
ation had rendered him motionless.
and a redshirt was foreseen. Bucking
the inactivity and anxiety of a red-
shirt. he recuperated quickly from
his surgery and took the field on
Saturday, an able replacement for
an All-America candidate. 5

ln many ways. (ireg Christy and
Al Wenglin.Vk0wski‘s paths to the
starting lineup on Saturday were
filled with similarities. Both had to
put up with injuries. both had been
forgotten members of‘ units that
hadn’t noticed they were gone. Both
had sat on the bench waiting for
Saturday. 4

This should have been Wengli—

- kowski°s eighth starting assignment,
but a severely sprained ankle in the

season opener against lllinois had
prevented his playing while paving
the way for Chris Doleman. While
Wenglikowski watched from the
sidelines. Doleman. in front of a
national television audience. per-
formed spectacularly against South
Carolina. Two batted passes and
four sacks later. Wenglikowski's
chances of re-capturing his starting
role appeared dim.

Greg Christy’s playing chances
appeared dim at ‘the start. An
impressive sophomore. Christy had
gone into spring camp with a good
shot at securing a starting tackle
spot opposite .limbo Covert. Knee
surgery abruptly ended that
thought. Advised to take a
redshirt that football tool that
maximizes the use of a football
player but also renders him a non-
functional part of the team for a
year Christy refused.

On Saturday. both players beat
the odds and started as the Panthers
rolled over Rutgers 47-3. Christy.
replacing .limbo Covert. was the
“key to the offense" according to

head coach Jackie Sherrill. Wengli- T

kowski. no less conspicuous. made
two tackles behind the line of
scrimmage. .

The Noontime LecturSie

By MARIE HUFF
The Pitt Lady Panther basketball

team was tested twice this weekend-

in serimmages against Slippery
Rock State College and Potomac
State. and received /\’s for both per~
formanees. After accumulating a
total ofo() points in the first half. Pitt
went on to down the Slippery Rock
squad I00-50 on Saturday after-
noon. ()n Sunday afternoon the
Lady Panthers blew Potomac blew

24.

The Slippery Rock scrimmage
provided an opportunity for vete-
rans Debbie Lewis. Gail Aughburns
and Pam Miklasevich to prove that
the Lady Panthers‘ possess a lethal
inside game again this year. The
game is complemented by the out-
side shooting of guards (‘arol
l)ugan and Beth Tarasi. who can
swish them from fifteen feet out with
uncanny regularity. .

Against”Potomac State. it was the
Pitt defense‘s turn to shine. ln the
first half of play, the Lady Panthers
used a tenacious press defense and
aggressive man—to—man coverage to
shut down the Potomac offense.
Potomac scored just twice in the fi rst
twenty minutes of play. lheir first
basket came at the 13:38 mark. while
the second basket came with j List six
minutes left in the half. lhe lady
Panthers also forced Potomac State
to commit 25 turnovers in the first
half.

hieanwltile. the Lady Panther
offense was using a balanced attack
to put 50 first-half points on the
board. Lewis. Dugan and larasi
converted turnovers into points reg-
ularly, either laying the ballin them-
selves. or passingto the traileron the
fast break for an assist.

The second half was very encour-
aging for second year coach .lud_\t
Saurer. as all I5 Lady Panthers

“dented the score column. Equally

important was the fact that the con-

Potomac State out of the gym l()X-

tinuous substitution did not disrupt
the defense. which allowed only 2()
points in the second half.

The bench strength of the Lady

nifer Bruce is a bﬁlls-eye shooter
with an agressive rebounding game

good inside moves and an improved
rebounding game. Freshmen Lew-

Gyinnastso Bounce to

win at Metro Meet

By scorr DELLETT

' 7 Doing welI_ in the opening meet is
a good sign for a team. If the Pitt
Panthers gymnastics team performs

I as well all season as they did Satu.-

day in the Metropolitan Gymnastic
meet in. Baltimore. the Panthers

~ could be one of the top squads in the

.country.

The Panthers outpointed Navy
I9l.4 to l84.2 to capture first place.
William and Mary finished a distant
thirdwith I67 points. I .

The Panthers showed their super-
iority in the floor exercise as Bob
Besong took first place with a score
of 9.0. while Frank Kratz ‘took
second with an 8.8.. Besong also fin-
ished‘ second in the high bars with a
score of 8.75 and in the all-around
with a 50.I5. Kratz finished right

behind Besong in the all-around

withva 49.85 total. .

Other top individual finishers for
Pitt included Mike Lloyd. in the side
horse. and “Nooch" Capanil. fourth
in the side horse.

Pitt Head Coach Frank D‘Amico
said he was very pleased with his
teams performance.

“In my opinion. Pitt dominated
the meet." said D’Amico. “The score
could have been higher if the guys
weren‘t as nervous and if we. had our
whole team here." ‘

“This is a good meet for the team.
The win givesus more confidence
going into the season. and the type
of competition we were going
against was some of the_bcst in the
East.” [)‘Amico said.

The Panther gymnasts are back in .

action next weekend. when they
travel to Slippery Rock for the.Two-
,and-Two Invitational.

Pitt Boaters’ Season

I ‘continued from page eleven
worthheaded a corner kick from

John Pi7.7_ell2I»into_the goal in the I

second half. The Panthers had a
goal scored by Shurlund Lucke
called back because of an
offsides call.

Bemis said that Pitt made too
many mistakes to win. and they
turned the ball over too often. He
praised West Virginia. 21 proba-
ble t’>jart'icipant in the NCAA

‘Championship Tournament. as
an excellent team.‘ L

The Panthers ended the season
with a record of8-7. Aftera great
start. winning their first six
games. the Panthers went on a
iskid. winning only two of their
last nine games. '

Bemis said that the team had
to rely on junior Eric Tiedtke and
senior Al Adelmann for most of
the scoring _tlJj_S._. vear. One of-

Bemis’ off-season tasks will be
finding someone to replace Adel-
mann next year.

Bemis felt t his team won
the games that they had to win:
but he added that some games
Pitt‘ lost could have gone either
way. Pitt did finish with a win-
ning record and the West Penn
Conference title. both of which
were goals the Panthers set out to
achieve this year.

Bemis said he is looking for-
ward to an even better team next
year. He will not lose anyone

from the forward line and Pitt‘s
defense will be as strong.
although Bemis said he thinks
that the midfield could improve.
The Panther‘s biggest problem
will be replacing goalie Scott
Thunberg. who is graduating this

mance there was disappointing. This
year. he is shooting for- higher
goals- -for both the Pitt team and
himself. '
“Last year. my goal was to make
nationals.“ said Besong. “This year.
my goals are even higher.”
Gymnastics for Besong started
when he was in the seventh grade.
when his two older cousins “con-‘c
vinced“ him to try the sport.
“Basically. they dragged me into
it.” said Besong. “Also. the head
coach (at Ambridge High School)
thought that if my cousins were
good gymnasts. then I could be a
good one."
Ambridge was. and still is. a
power in Western Pennsylvania high

‘ school gymnastics. so many college

coaches came to scout the talent

there. That is how Pitt Head Coach
Frank D’-Amico found Besong. A
“Bob was a sophomore in -high
school when I first saw him.and I y
just followed his ’.progress."i said

D’Amico. “His talents as a— high '

school gymnast impressed me."
The chance to be part of a build-

ing program and to compete under _

the tutelage of D‘Amico were the big

factors that convinced Besong to i

come to Pitt.
“Pitt wasjust building a program.

L and I wanted to make an impres-

sion.” said Besong. “Also. I liked
Coach D‘Amico. because he is a
good coach and his personality is
great. He will do anything for
people.” _ ' A

Besong from making an instant con-

coming into the program. I demand 4
them to work‘on techniques. My
coaching philosophy is not what you
can do; but ‘how well you do it.
“For example. kids in high school.
Bob included. are doing double
backﬂips. but the kids are not doing

the move right. I work them on get-

ting the basics in. then they cantry
harder tricks.“ .

Besonigifelt that this adjustment.
though difficult at first. helped him
to become the gymnast he is today.

“Coach D’Amico is a good techni-
cian. and this helped me out in
adjusting "to the ‘collegiate level..."
said Besong. “This work showedas I
made a lot of improvements during
my sophomore and junior year.”

D’Amico agrees with Besong’s
assessment about this rate of
improvement. '

‘fl;n his sophomore year. his work
on. techniques began to pan out."
said .D‘Amico. “By his junior year,
the techninique began to cli.ck.“

_ D‘Amico said ;Be.song‘s attitude is
one of the reasons for" his vast
improvement. I

“Bob has a good -attitude in prac-
tice.” said _D‘Amico. “He is not a
madman in“ the gym; He is always
doing everything I ask him to do."

.Besong‘s scoring consistency
helped him reach nationals last
season.

“I gaineda lot of constant scores
last year. particularly in the floor
exercise." said.Besong. “I matured in

-my skills. which gave me the confi-

dence to try new tricks and set high
goals for myself.” ’

The hard wiorktpaid off as Besong
qualified for nationals in thefloor
exercise. and-just missed qualifying

A One portion of the Pitt team had
awakened. The defense that had
allowed a freshman. Boston College
quarterback Doug Fluttie. to run
roughshod on them last week. didn‘t
go for the roll-out tactics this week.
Pitt used pressure from a variety of
areas to negate the extra time a roll-
out quarterback buys.

Pitt tackled Rutgers behind the
line of scrimmage ll times. four of
those by Michael Woods. who ﬂip-
flopped from either side of the line
«and consistently shot in to the back-
