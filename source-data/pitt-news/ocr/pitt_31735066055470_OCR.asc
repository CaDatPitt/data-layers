(Editors Note: This is the ﬁrst
in a three part series on
depression. )

During chemistry class at
Allegheny College, Michael
placed a substance into a cru-
cible, then watched the ﬂame
burn it into a fine powder. His
classmates were busy measur-
ing the powder and filling their
notebooks with numbers, but
Michael’s notebook remained
empty. Usually he executed his
chemistry experiments with
precision and accuracy. But
today he could only watch the
ﬂame.

“This is the last day of my
life,” he thought, “so I don’t
really need to do well on this.”

Later that afternoon, he
walked over to the student
union where students were
laughing and chatting outside.
He hoped to slip by unnoticed.
Inside, Shaffer Auditorium was
dark and empty. He made his
way up to the balcony, then
jumped onto the seats below.

Michael was suffering from
his first episode of depression.
His suicide attempt came about

a month after his depression
began.

A self-described “typical
overachiever” who was editor
of the yearbook in high school,
a member of both National
Honor Society and student
government, he noticed he
could no longer concentrate on
school work shortly after he
began his freshman year at
Allegheny College. - His friends
urged him to go out and have
fun, but he could neither enjoy
nor relax. ’

He spent much of his time
alone, in his room or in the
library. And his thoughts were
steeped in shame and guilt, cir-
cling around a continuous
theme: “I’m worthless. I’m an
embarrassment. I’m going to
kill myself.”

After his suicide attempt, he

.was taken to Allegheny

General Hospital, where he
accepted with relief the news
that he suffered from an illness
called depression.

Some call depression a thief
that slowly steals from its suf-
ferers. More than a passing
mood, or just feeling down, it
often deepens and lingers,
attacking physical needs, like

Pin student, artist
has paid his dues

By Jennifer Alpha
S raﬁ‘ Writer

About three years ago, Craig
Sanes was hired to create some
Christmas illustrations for a gift
company. Theyiwanted depic-
tions of Santa, so Sanes poured
out all his childhood visions of
the jolly old elf feeding his rein-
deer and supervising an assem-
bly line of intricately drawn lit-
tle toys.

He proudly took his drawings
back to the company. But they
turned them down, saying, “All
we want is Santa.”

It was then that Sanes realized
that, as an artist trying to make
a living, creative instincts some-
times have to come second to
the demands of the client.

“Thinking corporately is terri-
bly corrupting for an artist,”
Sanes, a sophomore political
science major, said. ,

But if you want to make a liv-
ing from your art, you’ve got to

V read your client. Sanes once

heard this from a professor at
Parsons School of Design in
New York, where he studied

from ll989- 1993. But lately,

he’s been learning this first
hand.

To get a glimpse of Sanes’
artistic and entrepreneurial skill,

one needs only to travel three
stories above Forbes Avenue to

the Attic in Oakland. Above the

stage is a mural of four musi-
cians that Sanes designed and
painted.

He had to put in a bid to get
the job. It being his first mural,
he set hisbid on the low side of
$1,000, really quite a bargain.
He plotted the design on a grid
on paper and then enlarged the
grids to transfer them to the
wall, keeping the images in per-
spective.

. He spent a month working on ’

the mural painting two to eight
hours a day. Sanes said the
management at the Attic was
very understanding about the
hours he spent, often closing
down the the section of the
stage to [set up scaffolding for
him to work on.

When it comes to pricing art
work, Sanes said an artist has to
be careful not to bid too low,
which would force other artists
to lower their prices.

“It’s not like a union system,”
Sanes said, “but it’s kind of like
an honor system.”

Many selling markets are
open for artists looking to enter
the trade, but all require persis-

' tence that takes time and energy.

Depression common in college students

A writer's personal
bout with the illness

first in a three-part series
of the author’s personal
experience with depres-
sion.)

While we sat at a booth
in a restaurant, my friends
and I talked about the
places we would go. It
was my 21st birthday and
two of my closest friends
took me out for lunch and
a movie. One of them
talked about moving to
California. ‘I talked about
someday going back to
France. But as we talked
and laughed and ate our
strawberry pie, I won-
dered if I would ever real-
ly escape the sadness that
seemed to follow me
wherever I went.

On the way home, I
decided the only way to

(Editor's note: This is the

live without it was to stop
living. As I walked up the
steps to my bedroom, I
had already decided what
I would do. I walked into
my room and swiftly
identified the bottle of
antidepressants on my
dresser. I would start with
those. I took the more
than 20 pills left in the
bottle, then decided to
take a shower as I waited
for their poison to spread
through my body. I decid-
ed not to leave a note
explaining my early
departure. I just wanted to
feel clean.

I thought only of the
cold mechanics of each
hollow action — stepping
out of the shower, pulling
a favorite green shirt on,
turning my head upside
down as I massaged my
wet hair with a towel.

' The first objective is to get

your work, and your name, out.

Advertising can help in this, but
sometimes it takes a little inge-

V nuity.
 For instance, Sanes would
display his work-at his father’s __

business, Gene Sanes
Upholstery in the Strip, when he
worked there on summer breaks
from Parsons. He actually sold a
chalk drawing of Robert
Kennedy to a lawyer at his
father’s store.

Self-promotion is important
with the cost of advertising so
high. Sanes oncespent $600-
$700 on advertising his portrait

seldom sit sti-ll. Older people

 have more chiseled.-features" that

_.j__'_,§§§',:§§1,§i¢I £0-. paint.‘ Sanes’ « has
“done about l2"of these portraits.

When Sanes sells one of his
portraits, he takes the commis-
sion and supports himself with
it. He works part-time with his
father when he is in need of
cash, but makes his primary liv-
ing from his art. Living with
three roommates helps cut the
costs.

Currently, Sanes has been

pursuing a goal to get his work
placed into galleries. His prefer-
ence is the Antique Gallery on
Carson Street. Galleries rotate
their exhibits every three
months, so Sanes dropped off
his portfolio at the galleries and
is waiting to see if any will be

interested "in ‘displaying his - -

Once on display, his pieces will
be up for sale. But selling a
piece in a gallery is difficult,
Sanes said. fl

“There are people: out there
who have been doing this three
times as long as I have been
alive,” Sanes said. Hesaid that
may be an exaggeration, but he
makes his point. C j ’

Born and raisedin Pittsburgh,
Sanes sent his portfolio out to
Parsons after returning to art
after a long hiatus. , _

He had taken some an classes
when he was nine, but stopped
and didn’t get t,he,,it”ch again
until he was 21, ‘whenjhe began
painting ajgainland ‘enrolled at
Parsons. I '  if    ‘

“Liking it came}~.f§ck right

away,” he said‘. 5'-‘Getting’ better

at it took about four or five
years.”

Sanes started his three years
at Parsons with a concentration
on sculpture, but soon switched
to oil painting. He said it’s the
medium he most enjoys work-
ing in because oil paints are
slow-drying and allow you to
spend a lot of time working with
the colors.

But when Parsons raised the
tuition by $4,000 Sanes was
forced to make a decision.
Unable to meet the soaring cost,
Sanes moved back to Pittsburgh
and enrolled at Pitt.

The switch to political sci— .

ence, a field that caught Sanes’
interestwhile taking his core

requirements at Parsons, put’

some limitations on the time
that he gets to spend painting
and sketching. A full course
load with 15 credits, five of
them being in a Chinese lan-
guage class that meets ﬁve days
a week, two hours a day,
requires a lot of devotion to
studying. He said paintingis
like an addiction and he must
carefully divide his time
between art and his studies-

“If I pick up a brush and go to

my canvas, I know I’ll~be-there

until the next day,” he said.

But Sanes makes use of every
spare moment’ he gets, If a pro-
fessor is reviewing material or
covering something he ‘has a
strong grasp on, he will choose
a person or object in the room
and sketch it until it’s time to
pay attention again.

Sanes would like to enter the
field of international politics
someday, but would also like to
spend some of his time making
a living by doing what comes
most naturally — art.

“No matter what I’m doing,”
Sanes said, “I can always
paint.”

resiclentiof College Republicans runiisiforpublic office

By Jim Rowe
Staff Writer

Jarrod Caruso, a self-pro-
claimed “little student
activist,” wanted to start a
Young Republican group in
his high school. The prob-
lem was, he couldn’t find
any teachers willing to
sponsor a conservative stu-
dent group.

So without a group to call
home, he kept up on politics
on his own, talking to
whomever would listen,
anxiously waiting until col-
lege to become politically
active.

Caruso eventually came to

I Pitt and joined the College

Republican group, and now
the once-perceived reac-
tionary is running for a seat
in _the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives, hoping
soon to have the official
backing of the Republican
party. _

The current Pitt senior and

College Republican presi-
dent is thus far.-running
unopposed in the May pri-
mary. If he remains unchal-
lenged and gets the
Republican nomination, he
will face off against democ-
ratic incumbent ,Harry
Readshaw for the 36th dis-
trict seat. The 36th district is
a Democratic stronghold,
only 22 percent Republican,
and includes Caruso’s home
in Pleasant Hills Borough.

“It will be quite an uphill
battle,’’ Caruso said, but he’s
ready for a fight. He attrib-
utes this attitude and his
success so far to the_experi—
ences he gained at Pitt.

“I got to Pitt and found the
College Republicans. Right
then, I decided that_this is
the group that I’m going to
be involved with in col-
lege,” Caruso said. .

And get involved he did.
Over his four years with the
College Republicans, Caruso
became active in Republican

politics in Allegheny
County, working on the suc-
cessful campaigns of such
politicians as Ernie Preate
and the recent commission-
ers ticket of Larry Dunn and
Bob Cranmer.

“A lot of people might not
admit to stuff like this at this
point,” Caruso said about
working for ‘Preate.
Regardless of Preate’s stand-
ing now, Caruso still consid-
ers the experience a good
one.

Over the course of his
involvement with the
Republican Party, Caruso
also got to meet Oliver
North at a rally for then-
presidential candidate
George Bush.

“I went to Market Square
and met him [North] and got
an autograph and a picture.
He’s not a bigwig and he
doesn’t have a whole lot of
pull anymore, but it’s neat to
know that I got to meet
him,” Caruso said.

PENGUINS HOCKEY  IT'S POWERFUL §TUFF

 

 The Pitt ,News,_'l_‘u_esday, J anuarty; 9,1996

Following his trip to
Market Square, Caruso
became actively involved
with Republican politics in
Allegheny County.

“I started working on the
Republican presidential
campaign, going down to the
headquarters at the Westin
William Penn. ’We’d go
down there, stuff envelopes
and make some phone calls.
I started talking to people,
and about that same time I

‘started to realize that I

didn’t want to stay in school
for the rest of my life to get
a medical degree,” he said.

' So he set his sights on law
school and a career in poli-
tics, dropping his psycholo-
gy major and pursuing a
political science degree.

Caruso’s first real interest
in politics, however, came at
a young age.

“I can recall once a con-
versation with my godfather,
my Uncle Peter, an ultra-
conservative who makes me
look like Teddy Kennedy. I
said to him, ‘You know that
I’m going to make a run
someday. I’m going to be a
senator and I’m going to fix
all this crap,”’ Caruso said.

Nobody really took him
seriously, though, until he
met a teacher named Heath
Emmerling. Emmerling was

«a history teacher and a

staunch Republican, with

‘ whom Caruso often stayed

long after-school hours talk-
ing politics. V .

“Mr. Emmerling was a bit
of an idol for me, as far as
teachers went. He, wasn’t the
best student when he was in
school. He wasn’t the
brightest student in his
class, but he was a hard
worker and he persevered.
He was also one of the few
Republican teachers that I
had, at least who admitted
so, and I was able to discuss
a lot of different things with
him without having to worry
about it affecting my grade,”
Caruso said.

“He told me that you don’t
always have to be the bright-
est kid in the class, the vale-
dictorian or the jock. You

just have to be a hard work-

er, and if you work hard
you’ll accomplish things,”
he said.

Caruso was raised in a dif-
ficult environment. Born out
of wedlock when his mother
was 22 years old, he was
raised for the most part by
his grandmother. His mother
eventually married another
man, ‘and Caruso grew up

 . with an step-sister and three

half-brothers. He worked
hard at Jefferson Hills High
School, was active in SADD
and the band, and was a

‘ founder of his high-»s'chool’s
history club. His grades,

weren’t that bad, and even-

V. tually he was accepted to.
Pitt, first into CGS night

school. ~

V His interest in partisan,
politics when he vwasi

younger was largely a result
of his family’s political val-
ues. In fact, Caruso admitted
to having some very liberal
political views when he was
younger ,

“At the time I didn’t like
Reagan because some of my
family members didn’t like
him,” he said. But as he got
older, Caruso began to real-
ize that political beliefs
can’t be based on what other
people think.

“Around the time of the
Bush—Dukakis race I really
started to look at the issues,
and I realized that Dukakis
was an idiot,” he said. “I
became a Bush supporter,
and my interest in
Republican politics started
rolling.”

Caruso has kept that
momentum rolling and now
hopes that his past
Republican efforts will pay
off as he begins preparations
for the May primary.

His official preparations
began over the winter break,
between Pitt’s fall and
spring semesters. Right now,
Caruso is in the process of
filing as a candidate and
petitioning, collecting
upwards of 1,000 signatures
of party backers in his
respective district.

“[The signatures] say,
basically, ‘Yeah, we want
him to run,”’ Caruso said,
noting that a signature does
not equal a vote. That’s
where his campaigning will
come in later.

Other than filing and peti-
tioning, Caruso said that
there is not much campaign-
ing forlthe primaries, a ben-
efit for him because he’ll
still be completing his final
semester at Pitt.

“I will do some campaign-
ing in the spring, a little
door-to-door in the more
democratic areas, just to get
my name out,” he said.
“Between May and October,
we’ll really gather forces
and prepare for full-fledged
campaigning.”

Caruso is counting on
some of his volunteer forces
coming from his College
Republican group. Although
many of the members will
be gone for the summer, he’s
hoping that he’ll get some
help from local members.
And in the fall, he’s count-
ing on help from the entire
group —— making calls, stuff-
ing envelopes and getting
the little jobs done.

Grassroots campaigning,
Caruso said, will be the base
ofhis campaign formula.

But depression has also been
called the most treatable mental
illness. With a combination of
psychotherapy and medication,
most people can be helped -
especially college students.

Dr. Kenneth Nash, a psychia-
trist who has a private practice
and also treats patients at Pitt’s
Student Health Center, says
students often respond better to
treatment than other population
groups. They’ve overcome
obstacles to get to college,
they’re often eager to learn
about the illness and are com-
pliant to treatment, and they
have access to counseling on
campus. Also, younger people
have less medical complica-
tions to interfere with treating
the depression.

Still, only half the the people
who suffer from depression
seek psychiatric help, accord-
ing to the National Institute of
Mental.Health. And untreated
depression kills. It’s been esti-
mated that 9.4 _ million
Americans suffer from depres-
sion and that 15 percent of
those sufferers may eventually
commit suicide.

Fear is one of the main obsta-
cles that keeps people from get-
ting the help they need.

“The stereotype has eased a
lot, but it’s still there,” says
Robert Gallagher, head of the
Counseling Center at . Pitt.
Many fear being labelled for
seeking help. And if they have
never stepped into a therapy
session before, they may not
know what to talk about.

Men think “it’s not manly” to
get help. In most studies,
women make up the majority
of people who are treated for
depression.

‘?I think that reﬂects not that
women have more mental or
emotional difﬁculty than men,
but that women are more
accepting of going for help,”

says Dr. Joe Schacter from the
Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic
Institute. “It’s just part of our
masculine-oriented value sys-
tem that makes going for help
something to be ashamed of.”

The Counseling Center
recently sent out a survey in
which 34 percent of the 800
students who responded said
they had experienced depres-
sion from a moderate to very
high level at one point and
could have used assistance in
getting through it. If applied to
the campus population, over
9,000 students are out there
who feel they need help.

But students, trying to estab-
lish independence for the first
time, may believe getting help
would break down that effort.

Many have traced this symp-
tom of society back to early
frontier history, when indepen-
dence defined so much of who
Americans were and what they
accomplished.

But another period of
American history promoted the
idea of going to a mental health
professional. According to

Schacter, in the ‘50s and ‘60s, I

people thought psychoanalysis
could help them better them-
selves, their relationships and
their careers.

“People used to go to analy-
sis, not because they were sick
or having emotional difficul-
ties, but because they thought it
would help them realize their
fullest potential,” says

Schacter, who has been an ana- ‘

lyst since 1957.

“People did it because they
wanted to do it. That’s certainly
not the case anymore.”

 

   

One day last October, about
34 students voluntarily took a
test.

They answered questions
such as “Do you feel dim-
hearted, blue or sad?”, “Do you
have trouble sleeping?”, “Are
you tired for no reason?”

It was National Depression
Screening day, and Pitt Student
Health along with the
Counseling Center made infor-
mation and screening available
in the William Pitt Union.
About 50 people stopped by
the table for information, and
34 participated in the screening
process. Twenty of those were
referred for treatment.
Coordinators called it a suc-
cess. .

Jan De Voe, clinic coordina-
tor for Student Health, says
screenings like these help to
reduce the stigma of depres-
sion. They make information
about depression available and
approachable, and they direct
people to the help they need.

“There was also a ﬁlm avail-
able that talked about depres-
sion to let people know that
there is hope and treatment,”
De Voe says.

Another important message
seems to be catching on, too. “I
think people are understanding
more that it is a disease.”

As more information about

depression has become avail-

able in the past few years,

many say the stigma has gradu- V

ally lifted. Research uncover-
ing some of the biological
bases of depression has helped

People have begun to see the
value in facing depression and
dealing with it rather than
ignoring or trying to hide it.

“Anyone who goes [for
help] is always anxious and
fearful,” Schacter says. “But it
means you're demonstrating a
certain amount of courage, a
willingness to confront being
anxious.”
_ Those who fear getting pro-

“need to realize that there’s
hardly any of us who go
through life without needing a
helping hand.”

Nash says decreasing the

New Year's resolutions

Happy New Year! We hope everyone had a great break,
and has returned ready for another wonderful semester at
Pitt. We are all faithful that everyone has resolved, in honor
of the New Year, to buckle down and study hard to get the
best out of their Pitt experience. Hopefully, Pitt has taken
the same opportunity to make some resolutions to make that
experience the best it could be.

In case the Powers That Be haven’t decided on their reso-
lutions yet, let us offer some suggestions.

-Shut down Bigelow Boulevard between the Cathedral and
the student union. It would be so much nicer for students to
be able to get to class without having to play Dodge ‘Em in
order to get there. We might also find it a bit easier to con-
centrate in class if we didn’t have to try to shake off our near
death experiences every time we go to the Cathedral.

-Stop wasting our money on stupid projects. While it is
nice to know that we are, in fact, at the University of
Pittsburgh, is it really necessary to spend thousands of dol-
lars on signs to hang every ten yards or so to let us know
that? And if the signs weren’t enough to let you know where
you are spending four years of your life, just take a look at
the Forbes entrance to the student union. Several more thou-
sands to emblazon “Pitt” on the sidewalk for all of posterity
to know where they are.

Extend the computer lab and library hours so that we
might actually be able to find an open terminal when we
need one. Believe it or not, some students actually do rise
before noon on weekends, and many of us would even work
on .papers after seven if given the opportunity. While it is
certainly nice of the university to keep the bars in mind
when planning schedules, try to keep students there too.

-Try to find a couple of people who actually know how to
play football. If we’re going to keep handing out full schol-
arships to football players, they should at least be able to
play the game. If Northwestern can go from last place to a
major bowl game, so can Pitt.

°Two words: phone registration.

°If we are goingto have general education requirements,
make them ones which are valuable. Either replace some-
thing that is already there, or just add an introductory com-
puter class to the general education curriculum require-
ments.

°Find a new chancellor. ‘Not just a chancellor-of—the-year
(or interim, etc.), but a real live person to take charge and do
what needs to be done for and to this university to make it a .
better place. We have nothing against Mark Nordenberg, but
if he is the best person for the job, give it to him permanent-
ly. Don’t pick someone just for the hell of making a selec-
tion, pick the person who is best for the job.

These are, of course, only a few suggestions. If the Powers
That Be have any further ideas, we can only add those to the
list. But there is one final recommendation — if you make a
resolution, keep it. Don’t make promises you can’t or won’t
live up to.

’ It has been brought to my
attention recently that some peo-
ple are not too happy with some
things being written in The Pitt
News. As theeditor in chief, I
think it’s time I set the record"
straight and correct any miscon-
ceptions people might have
about this newspaper.

The group of upset people is a

, diverse one including Greeks,
‘(don’t be too shocked) student

government leaders and an

ofﬁée worker in admissions and

ﬁnancial aid.

Before I get into the speciﬁcs‘

of those problems there a few
important points I’d like to make
about this newspaper.

°The Pitt Newsis a real news-
paper, with computers and type-
writers and everything. We have
four paid professionals on staff,
but after that, every aspect of the

V paper is run by students.

°The Pitt News is an INDE-
PENDENT, student-run newspa-
per. We don’t receive money
from Pitt or donations from
alumni. Zero. Nothing. The only
money we get is from national
and local advertisers.

-The Pitt News is not a public
relations arm for the university.
It is not our responsibility to toot
Pitt’s horn. That’s their job. As I
previously stated, we are a real

'- newspaper, not a PR newsletter.

Now, about some of these
complaints:

A recently graduated Pitt stu-
dent, a former high-ranking offi-
cial in the Inter-Fraternity
Council, was very upset with
The Pitt News’ coverage of the
recent incident with the Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity. He told me
that I was being too aggressive,
going to see Pitt administrators
daily to get an update on the
investigation.

Another Pitt student, this one a
sister in a sorority, wondered
why the stories warranted front
page attention.

To answer both of these com-
plaints, I go no further than the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The
story on ZBT getting expelled
ran on their front page. _If it’s
important enough to be on their

    

Mark
Gordon

front page it’s going to be on this “

front page, no matter how
aggressive we have to be.

Complaint number two:

In late November, there was a
headline in this newspaper that
read “Pitt student raped on
Cathedral Lawn.”

There is one very simple rea-
son why we ran that headline. A
Pitt student was raped on the
Cathedral Lawn.

That’s what was reported to
the Pitt Police; that’s what was
reported to us. ,

The reason‘ I bring this up i
because the day that story ran I
received a phone call from a
staffer in admissions and finan-
cial aid.

Not only did she think the
headline was too strong and the
story didn’t warrant front page
attention, she said it was mis-
leading because “she wasn’t
raped, she was date—raped.”

Huh? Rape is rape. It’s a seri-
ous problem in society and it
won't be buried in the police
blotter. As long as I’m editor a
rape "story goes on page one.

Also, to any upset Pitt admin-
istrators, (I know you’re out
there) lighten up. If somebody is
not going to come to Pitt
because a student was raped and
the campus newspaper reported
on it, then let them go to Indiana
University of Pennsylvania.
There are no rapes there, right?

Once you understand that this
newspaper is an independent
one, and not a press release, I
believe it serves three very
important functions.

First, a campus newspaper
must be a community and a gov-

ernment watchdog. The Pitt pro-

‘ fessor whé"has drilled "that ‘ifitd“’ ‘A;

my skull is the same Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette staff writer who
broke the Wesley Posvar

Scandal in the late 1980s, so he .

has some experience in that
field.

The Pitt News’ community is
Pitt and its government is the
administration. So The Pitt News
takes an extremely active role in
watching these areas. We give a
substantial amount of news cov-
erage on the front page and we
have frequently written about
the administration and its deci-
sions on our opinions page.

Second, a campus newspaper,
must inform its community of
the news, hence the word news-
paper. Last semester The Pitt
News had important stories like
the one about a cook at Schenley
Cafe who had hepatitis and an
article on the new IDs.

Third, a campus newspaper
should serve as a stepping stone
and a learning experience for
anyone who wants a career in
journalism. It should be 5 place
where you can learn from your
mistakes and polish your skills
for the real world.

We’ve been pretty successful‘

in that area as well. For the
record, the associate editor and
assistant to the editor at the
Post-Gazette both worked for
The Pitt News and Myron Cope
was the sports editor in 1960.
The list of successful journalists
who started out at The Pitt News
is an extensive one. ,

Well, there you have it: why I
think an independent. campus
newspaper is crucial for Pitt, no
matter what Greeks, SGB or
anyone else says. V

I’m not saying all the com-
plaints we receive are without
merit, just some. In the end, this
is your campus newspaper, so if
you don’t like what you see or
read let us know.

Write a letter, call or e-mail.
Use the numbers in the box‘ at
the bottom left hand side of the
page. -

chief of The Pitt News.

Pitt’s fraternities can offer more to the new
student than most other campus organiza-
tions. Each of the 21 national fraternities on
campus has its own unique characteristics
and personalities which means that there is a
fraternity for everyone. These fraternities
have many things to offer that will not only
enhance your college life, but be valuable

MORGANTOWN, W.Va —
Jerry McCullough’s team-
mates call him “Ice” because
he doesn’t-show any emotion.

Now they can call him
“Ice” because he has the abil-
ity to convert in pressure sit-
uations.

It was McCullough’s three-
pointer from 22 feet out with
West Virginia’s Cyrus Jones
in his face that tied the
Mountaineers at 73-73. The
shot came with just 3.5 sec-
onds left in regulation and
sent the game into overtime.

“The play was for me,”
McCullough said. “I had
passed it up twice before, but

not this time. I decided this-

one was mine.

“[Jones] saw me, looked

into my eyes and knew I was
going to shoot. He pushed me
out a little. It felt good, and I
prayed it went in.” ’
‘ “I knew he was going to tie
the game,” said Pitt center
Gerald Jordan. “In the time-
out, I told him ‘this is your
game.”’

Pitt wins two, Iosesto No. 2 Iowa St.

The two times McCullough
passed up shots, he dished
the ball to Kevin Willard,
who missed an open three
from the left wing and anoth-
er from the left baseline. ’

“[Jerry] knew we needed a
three in that spot and there
wasn’t a lot of time left,” said
head coach Ralph Willard.
“He didn’t have too many
options. He threw some great
passes to Kevin, who missed
two wide-open threes.

“It was good to see Jerry
step up as a senior and knock
the shot down.”

McCullough carried the
momentum from his three-
pointer into overtime, scoring
four of Pitt’s 11 points in the
extra period to help the
Panthers hold off West
Virginia 84-83 in front of
7,789 at the Coliseum.

Jordan also stepped up in
overtime, -scoring Pitt’s final
four points. The final two
came on a putback of a
McCullough miss with one
minute left to put the
Panthers up by three.

Senior John Richey struggled through his 134-

Pitt wrestling coach Rande Stottlemyer always
likes to say that it’s seniors who carry his team.
If the seniors perform, the team will do well.

The seniors had a rough day yesterday as the

The marathon session consisted of a series of

While most students were

break from school ,the
men’s and women’s swim
teams were swimming, lift-
ing weights and running.

Although the teams were
in South Florida, they spent
most of their time working
and had little time for any-
thing else. The men were on
the west coast in Venice and
the women were on the east
coast in Coral Springs.

“They didn’t have much
free time and the time they
did have was spent resting»
in their rooms,” said
women’s coach Marian
Cassidy. “They had four
hours in the pool a day and

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. - It was

1 supposed to be Pitt’s little guys going

up against West Virginia’s big guys.
But even though Panther point guard
Jerry McCullough hit the shot that sent
the game into overtime, this game was
controlled by Pitt’s big men — Chad

 Varga and Gerald Jordan.

Jordan had 16 points and pulled in

ii 20 rebounds and Varga led all scorers
2; with 22 points in Pitt’s 84-83 OT win

in Morgantown Saturday.

The duo also shot just under 50 per-
cent from the floor, tremendouslyjbet-
ter then the rest of the Panthers. Their

‘_ 13 offensive rebounds were more than
' the entire Mountaineer roster.

And they dominated West Virginia’s

Lbig men, 6-foot-11 sophomore Gordon

Malone and Brazilian junior Sandro
Varejao, also 6-11.
“Malone is a real good player. They

just weren’t as aggressive as us

Panther big men dominate the boards against WVU

with 10 rebounds and only one offen-
sive board.

Jordan didn’t know how to explain
his Dennis Rodman-like rebounding '5
effort.

“I just love to rebound. It was a good
opportunity for me.”

Varga, who’s listed at 6-6, and
Jordan, 6-10, are both juniors but this -
is the first season they have played _.
together. Jordan transferred last year i"
from Morgan State and Varga was a
junior college transfer.

“They have a real big front line, but
all that means is that we had to work 
harder,” Varga said. “We made the '
plays we had to in the second half.” .

The second half is where the
Panthers woke up. Down by three at_  <:
the break they struggled early on but as‘ ' ‘V
thepace picked up so did the Panthers.

Guard Garrick Thomas had a scoring
spurt, including a monster dunk
halfway through the half to tie the 1.

dominated.

Former Pitt forward
Orlando Antigua said in
last year’s basketball media
guide that “to play basket-
ball somewhere.” were his
aspirations after graduation

Antigua has achieved his

goal.

Last week the world-
renowned Harlem
Globetrotters named

Antigua their newest mem-
ber, making him only the
second non-African-
American to ever play for
the Globetrotters.

“The Globetrotters are
considered to be ambas-
sadors of basketball,”
assistant Pitt basketball
coach Sean Cleary said.
“The Globetrotters are
entertainers, and Orlando’s
attitude and personality

Last season the 6-foot—7,

Globetrotters said they like
his three-point shooting

Antigua was an integral
part of Pitt basketball in his

out of St. Raymond’s High
School in New York,
Antigua started 21 of 34
games for the Panthers and

The two-time team cap-
tain was also named the
1994 National Basketball
Writers Association’s Most
Courageous Award mainly
for having a bullet lodged
in the back of his head
after being shot in high
school.

Never known as a prolific
scorer, Antigua made his
presence felt by his uncan-‘
ny hustle and heart, which
is why Cleary thinks .
Antigua is a perfect fit for
the Globetrotters.

“You’ve got to remember,

Pitt’s savior on the boards.
With the Panthers only shoot-
ing 20.7 percent (6-29) from
the field in the first, and 35.8
for the game, Jordan grabbed
20 rebounds to go along with
16 points. Nine of the
rebounds were offensive.

Pitt controlled the boards
all game, out-rebounding the
Mountaineers 59-41.

“When you shoot as poorly
as we do, we’re going
to have a lot more opportuni-
ties for rebounds,” Willard
said.

Forward Chad Varga led
the Panthers with 22 points,
while grabbing seven
rebounds. His free throw to
cap off a three-point play
gave Pitt its only lead of the
second half at 58-57 with
7:17 left in the game.

aggressive and play harder.
Then we came out and made
the plays we had to in the
second half. We established
an aggression point in the
second half.”

Despite shooting so poorly
from the field in the first
half, the Panthers were per-
fect from the foul line, mak-
ing all 13 attempts, and went
into halftime only trailing by
three at 30-27.

In the second half, the
Panthers increased their
shooting percentage to 39
percent, but more important-
ly, they had a little luck on
their side. _

West Virginia was putrid
from the line, going 11 of 22
in the half and 16 of 33 in the
game. The two most costly
misses came when forward

With 20 seconds left, Pitt
trailed 73-68. Then
McCullough drove for a
layup to bring Pitt within
three. Needing to foul, Kevin
Willard hacked Solheim who
missed both shots of the dou-
ble—bonus penalty.

“I have no idea what hap-

‘pened to our free-throw

shooting,’ West Virginia
coach Gale Catlett said.
“Brent is a good kid, and
strong mentally. I know he’s
disappointed but I know he’ll
come back from this.”

The misses left the door
open for McCul1ough’s
game-tying three.
McCullough grabbed eight
rebounds and dished out six
assists to go along with his
20 points.

Jones led the Mountaineers
with 22 points.

The game ended after West
Virginia’s Greg Simpson
dribbled the length of the
court and threw up an off-
balanced shot in the key that

bounced off the rim.

“We went through so many
games like this last year,”
McCullough said. “We stole
this one on the road.”

“This is a long season,
there aren’t too many wins on
the road,” Willard said. “The
teams that do well in the
beginning always aren’t
the ones who do well at the
end. This is an 18-game
conference schedule, plus a
conference tournament. It’s
one of the most grueling
things players and coaches
can go through.”

The win was Pitt’s third in
a row and is now 6-3 and 1-1
in the Big East. WVU
dropped to 5-5 and 0-3.
It was the Panthers’ first win
in the Coliseum since the
1987-88 season and only
the fourth ever in 21 trips.

But it was the type of
win Pitt needed to gain
confidence going into
Tuesday’s game against No.

ing scorer, Cyrus Jones, and
threw a long pass to Jason
Maile who hit a layup, clos-
ing the gap to 66-62.

A Varga dunk and layup in
the final 60 seconds set the
stage for McCul1ough’s
game-tying three pointer.

In overtime, Jordan and
Varga continued their tough
defensive play. A goaltend-
ing call on Jordan gaveWest
Virginia their first two
points.

In the closing two minutes
of the game Jordan hit an 11-
footer to give Pitt an 82-79
lead and then hit a layup with
1:08 to go, putting the game
out of reach, 84-81. .

Varga and Jordan hope
their strong play inside will
carry over to Othella
Harrington and the
Georgetown Hoyas.

Wrestling

°Fr0m page 14

The feature match of the day was Iowa State against Pitt and
the first two matches lived up to their billing. Eric Knopsnyder
and Mike Ziska lost close matches at 118 and 126 pounds respec-
tivel .

Things fell apart once again at 134 pounds. With Richey out,
freshman Jeremy Lengle had to be thrown into the fire against
Iowa State’s Dwight Hinson, ranked third in the country at his
weight class. The result was ugly — a 23-8 technical fall for
Hinson.

In the l42—pound bout, Pitt’s J .J . Fasnacht was handed his first
defeat of the season, a 4-3 decision to Clody Tate, rartked fourth
coming into the match.

The Cyclones ran the score to 24-0 until Bryan Matusic finally
gave Pitt something to cheer for with a 3-0 victory over Matt
Patitz. With their comfortable lead, Iowa State forfeited the last
two matches to make the final team score a deceptively close, 24-
15.

Stottlemyer was disappointed in the team’s performance.

“We hoped to do better,” he said. “There were some matches
we could have won. At 126, 42, 50 we had close losses. We need
to win those.”

Pitt came back to close out the day against Slippery Rock. The
match started out even, with each team winning two of the ﬁrst
four weight classes.

At 142 pounds, Fasnacht provided one of the highlights of the
day. His 15-6 decision over Eric McKay was his 100th career vic-
tory, a mark reached by only two other wrestlers in Pitt history.

From there, Pitt dominated.

Joel Girosky recorded the only pin of the afternoon for the
Panthers, defeating Shaftone Dunklin at 4:28 in the 167-pound
match. Matusic went 3 for 3 on the day with an 8-2 decision over
Eric Witherite. Pitt defeated Slippery Rock 31-7.

After the meet, Stottlemyer recognized that underclassmen
have something to contribute to the team as well as the seniors.

“Mike Ziska did a really nice job, and so did Larry Sprecher,”
Stottlemyer said. “They still have a long way to go, but they’re
getting there. Same thing with Joel Girosky. He has some kind of
blood disorder, and that hurts his conditioning. He did well
today.”

Pitt is now 4-2 on the season. The Panthers host Northern Iowa

V on Thursday night.

Wrestling Notes: J .J . Fasnacht has been chosen to compete at
the National Wrestling Coaches Association All-StarWrestling
Classic on Jan. 29 at the University of Iowa. Fasnacht is 18-1 so

must be done.

For Mark Blount: A little
less smiling. Although I find it
refreshing to see such a good-
natured player, he needs to get
mean, at least sometimes.

For Bill Cowher: His first
Super Bowl ring.

For Neil O’Donnell: A little
respect. Year after year,
O’Donnell leads the Steelers
to the playoffs. His winning
percentage is third among
active quarterbacks, his inter-
ception percentage is the low-
est of all-time.

For Ray Seals: The
Sportsman of the Year Award.
Seals played through the death
of his cousin, under question-
able circumstances, and
should have made the Pro
Bowl.

For Darnell Dinkins: A
Kordell Stewart rookie card.
“Slash Dinkins” -—— it has a
ring to it.

For J aromir Jagr and
Kevin Greene: An eight-dol-
lar coupon to Supercuts. It’s
not that they look unprofes-
sional, I’m just jealous.

For the Chicago Bears,
Detriot Lions, Miami
Dolphins, Oakland Raiders
and Cincinnati Bengals: The
knowledge that no matter how
much money a team spends on
offense, defense always wins
championships.

For Scottie Pippen: A hair-
piece. I realize he’s not bald,
but if he ever shaves his head
again, revealing his alter ego
Prunehead Man, he will regain

Gheorge Muresean.

For Joe Paterno: 58 players
with attitudes very similar to
that of Deion Sanders. Maybe
then Joe might find somebody
with a bigger head than his.

For A.C. Green: A night of
fornication with a female. The
30-year-old virgin must have
some pent—up feelings waiting
to explode.

For Tony Mandarich,
Chris Washburn, Brian

Bosworth and Marcus
Liberty: A chance to return to
their respective sports. Hey, if
Ryne Sandberg can come
back, give these guys a
chance.

Finally, the true fans of the
blue-and-gold can’t be forgot-
ten. We, as a collective unit,
have suffered tremendously‘
over the past few years. To the
Pitt fans I give the hopes that
our teams, filled with promise
