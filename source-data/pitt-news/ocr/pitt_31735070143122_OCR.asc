Oakland services salute   veterans

by Liz Navratil
New Editor

Four years ago, Pitt law stu-
dent Meredith Odato had her life
planned out. ‘

She was going to marry her
childhood friend, Jason Frye, a
lance corporal in the Marine Corps.
Her plans ended when a roadside
bomb near Fallujah, Iraq, killed
Frye.

On Monday, Memorial Day, 23-
year—old Odato marched in place
outside the Soldiers & Sailors Me-
morial Hall as Drill Sgt. Patrick
Witcop yelled in her face, “Lighting
struck and down they fell.” _

“Lighting struck and down they
fell,” Odato and 14-year-old Daryl
Blakeley, who marched in place
beside her, screamed back.

“’Stead of going to heaven they
went straight to hell.”

“’Stead of going to heaven they
went straight to hell.”

Odato and Blakeley were com-
petitors in the first Miss Soldiers
& Sailors Competition, which oc-
curred during the museum’s annual
Memorial Day celebration.

‘Odato won the 18-25 age group
and Blakeley won the 13-17 age

group.

Blakeley said she heard about
the competition from family mem-
bers. Odato learned about it when
she called the museum to volunteer
to help with the celebration.

Each year, Odato said she tries

to do something special on Me-

morial Day to remember Frye.
She joined the Marine Corps

‘shortly after his death, but had to

quit when she broke her leg — a
disqualifying injury — on a train-
ing course. M

Odato said she felt “eternally
grateful for that brief opportunity
to wear that uniform.”

She saidserving in the Marine
Corps gave her a new appreciation
for the nation’s fallen officers. She
said she learned that “it is not be-
cause they died that we are free. It
is because they truly lived.”

The museum’s celebration in-
cluded a slideshow of hundreds
of local men and women who died
serving in the armed forces.

There was Army Sgt. Keith A.
Bennett, a middle-aged man with a
receding hairline. There was Army
Staff Sgt. Christopher E. Cutchall,
who smiled as he gave a peace sign
to the camera. And there was Army
Spc. Rodney A. Jones, who wore a
black tuxedo with a bow tie almost

E Company unveils plans for

Soldiers and Sailors lawn

by Liz Navratil
New E9itor

Officials at Soldier & Sailors Me-
morial Hall unveiled plans yester-
day to renovate the museum’s front
lawn.

But don’t fret They still want
students to use it to sunbathe and
play Frisbee.

“When they do that, we want
them to recognize what this place
is,” Michael Cherock said Cherock
is a disabled veteran whose com-
pany, Powerhouse Design, created
the plans for the project pro bono.

“Our main goal and what we hope country in a military capacity.”
The Remembrance Park, which

people experience is that they reflect
upon people who have served the

rtesy Powerhouse Design

    

will cost about $4 million to $5 million,

will divide the lawn into
three sections: a memo-
rial lawn, an honor garden
and a veterans’ plaza
Cherock and his
partners plan to remove
the sidewalk that runs
through the middle of
the lawn to clear the path
for the memorial lawn,
which will be closest to

Fifth Avenue. Instead, -

SempleF est judge

rethinks penalties

by Lori Stover
Staﬁ’ Writer

A local judge said he’s less likely
to give students community service
for offenses they commit during
SempleFest.

In the past, Judge Eugene Ric-
ciardi has given students the option
to perform community service if
they were cited at SempleFest, a
party in which students tradition-
ally overrun Semple Street drinking
alcohol, for summary offenses such
as underage drinking and public
drunkenness. If the person opted

for this punishment, he could per-
form community service and, after
paying a $100 fee and completing
some paperwork, have the citation

' expunged fromihis record.

But Ricciardi said he’s now
“concerned about SempleFest. The
offenses over there seem very over
the edge.”

Pitt police Sgt. Tracy Harasyn
said she’s still collecting statistics
from this year’s SempleFest, which
occurred in April, but that at least
22 people received citations. The
previous year, 64 people were

arrested, 18 of which were Pitt
students.

If a person is found guilty of
offenses such as public drunk-
enness —- a common offense at
Semp1eFest —— he might receive
a $300 fine, will have to pay for
court expenses and might have his
driver’s license suspended for 90
days, Ricciardi said.

Whether the judge finds the
person guilty or innocent, the of-
fense will remain on the offender’s
record for five years before it can
be removed, he added.

Ricciardi said he likes when
he can go easy on people cited at
SempleFest.

pecially in summary cases,” said
Ricciardi. 0

While said his priority is to rule
on the evidence, but that he takes

into consideration that in a few‘

years, the student will graduate and
try to enter the work force, which

_ can be difﬁcult ‘with a summary

offense on the record.

Ricciardi said he looks first at
the type of the crime and checks
for past offenses, but he also con-
sults the arresting officer before
offering community service. If the
officer wishes to prosecute the of-
fender, Ricciardi said he must fol-
low the decision made. 0

,Ricciardi said ofﬁcers tend to

prosecute more often for citations
given at SempleFest than other in-
cidents.

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney
said he understands the increase in

tend to be the ones who get cited,

Delaney said. So offering them a
harsher punishment might not help
deter people from participating,
he said.

of others.

The slideshow lasted 15 minutes, each
picture staying on the screen for about three
seconds. The room was silent except for a
boy asking his father, “Is a captain better
than a sergeant?” and a woman who said,
“I can’t watch this.”

Outside, Flavor Band played 19705 music
while people ate hot dogs and danced.

On the opposite side of the patio was
Nicholas Viglione, a World War II veteran
who volunteered at the celebration for the

last 40 years.

Viglione fought in southern France in
General George Patton’s army until he was
wounded injanuary 1945. His brother, Mi-
chael, died during the war.

Viglione said he thinks about his brother
“quite a bit.” On Memorial Day and Veterans
Day, he thinks of hundreds of other soldiers,
as well, particularly those who come from
Western Pennsylvania.

“They were always tops,” he said. “It was
the way they were raised here.”

‘We wanted a way to display this monu—

grown around that” John McCabe, executive
vice president of Soldiers & Sailors, said. “This
is our dream.” '

The third portion, the veterans’ plaza, will sit
against the building. The museum will use it to
hold events like the Memorial Day celebration
it held Monday.

McCabe said he hopes the project, which will
receive  mostly through donations, will be
completed in time for the museum’s 100th anni-
versary in October 201 0. But he said it most likely
won’t be done for another four or ﬁve years

 Warnings key

; Compared to the usual fair, last
i SempleFest was relatively subdued.
 The street was nearly devoid of the
 characteristic drunken debauchery.
 While SempleFest will most likely
 occur  next year, will it resume
 its typical chaos? Perhaps not New,
 stricter punishments seek to make sure
 the hype has ﬁzzled out for good.

 Underage drinking, disorderly
3 conduct and public drunkenness are
 among the most common offenses
 at SempleFest. In the past, when
 a student was cited at SempleFest,
 Judge Eugene Ricciardi, a local judge,
3 sometimes gave the student the choice
 of doing community service, 

j out some paperwork, and paying a

 $100 fee so that the offense would be .

 clearedfrom the individual’s record,

 “the offenses [at SempleFest] seem
 very over the edge” He said he’ll be

 nity service and, regardless of whether
 a person is found guilty, the citation

 at least five years.

SempleFest defense

won’t reach its potential. And yet,
SempleFest remains a firmly ingrained
touchstone of Pitt party culture. Die-
hard SempleFest attendees won’t be
fazed by new consequences, no matter
how strict.

If administrators really want to
quell the SempleFest scene, they’ve
only to look to the tactics irnple—
mented this past year. In light of the
unprecedented rioting that consumed
post—Super Bowl Oakland, police and
University officers were wary of an
elevated party spirit set to release its
wrath on Semple Street April 17.

In response, city police afﬁxed let-
ters to Semple Street residents’ doors
that warned against participating in
illicit activities during SempleFest
Similarly, Pitt’s Office of Residence
Life delivered cautionary letters to
students  on campus. Around
campus,  posters issued by
the University were prevalent

In the end, the trepidation proved
effective. SempleFest this year was
watered down at best and a constant
cohort of police kept the mayhem
minimal. , -

Even if the Steelers don’twin the
Super Bowl next year and nothing

else incites a wayward riot among M

the Pitt student body, administrators
shouldn’t forget the precedent set this
past year.  letters should be
issued regardless and an increased po-
lice presence should become standard.
Whilejudge Ricciardi’s stricter regula-
tion will likely deter some SempleFest
attendees, above all, the cautionary
mentality demonstrated by University
administrators and police shouldn’t be

cast aside

Taxes replacing safer cigarettes

 

by Dave Beitzel
Amt. Opiniorw E3itor

I like smoking.

Actually, I love smoking. Since
mononucleosis infiltrated my body,
however, I’ve engaged in the attempt
to quit.

My blood pressure, heart rate
and carbon monoxide levels have
dropped. I’m regaining some circu-
lation, lung capacity and sharpening
my senses of taste and smell. Plus,
I’m salvaging years of my life and
ﬁstfuls of dollars.

It’s hell.

I quit before, for an entireyear.

A Then, through the attrition of one

cigarette here and there, I quit quit-

ting. One cigarette at a party turned
into one afterevery coffee, during

_ every walk outside, after every meal

and so on. Iwas chasing the dragon’s
breath  before I knew it.
Nothing takes the place of that
simple ritual. Not sunflower seeds,
not gum and certainly not some mu-
tant bandage that secretes nicotine.
Electronic cigarettes come closest
to a non-threateningalternative, as

they’re basically battery-operated,
carcinogen—free metal cigarettes that
deliver nicotine in a smokeless vapor.

However, the FDA is impeding the

saleof these “e—cigarettes” —— co-
incidentally, the federal government
recently instituted the largest cigarette
tax increase in history.

Pennsylvania already imposes a tax
of $1.35 per pack. Now, the federal
government levies $1.01 per pack, up
from 39 cents, and some members
of the Senate Finance Committee
support raising it another dollar per
pack to fund a national health care
program.

Ay, there’s the rub. State and federal
governments use cigarette taxes to
fund programs including SCHIP, gov-

ernment-sponsored health insurance

for children, so health care revenue ‘
becomes dependent upon smoking.

Maybe the United States should just
adopt a policy like the Hubei Prov-

- ince  China. There, the government
' recently instituted a smoking quota

for local officials, forcing locally pro-

duced cigarettes on some people to

bols_ter the economy.

I get a cigarette that doesn’t contain

_ People throughout history have
burnt plants and inhaled the vapors
since mankind invented stupidity.
Cigarettes’ actually have some beneﬁts,
however petty. Smoking can reduce

'stress,evenif it’s'ust ' those few
1

minutes to block out the world and
decompress. It also acts like a social
stimulant — you’ll meet some great
random people over a cigarette. Some
studies even suggest that smoking
prevents Parkinsonsdisease.
Hecklers can say, “Smokingwill kill
you,” but non—smokers die every day.
Don’t tell smokers thefre going to die
——tthat’s hypocritical. Nobody’s im-
mortal. For all-the talk of shortened
life spans, there’s always some unaf-
fected octogenarian-jwho picked up
his first unﬁltered Lucky Strike behind,

a tool shed at age 11 and smoked ever ’

since with no problems. _ g ,
Most people, though, don’t have

that 80-year-old’s genes, and smok-_

ing doesn’t just cleanly cut "off some
otherwise senile years. It poisons

With new taxes, We ﬁnally have a reason to not smoke

almost every organ in the body, un-
naturally  smokers all the way to

chronic diseases and terminal cancers. .

You don’t go gentle into that good
night.

So a lot of people think they can
smoke for a few years and then quit.

‘Oh, to be a doe-eyed youth again.

Quitting cigarette smoking isn’t
like kicking heroin —— who started
that gross exaggeration? —-— but it isn’t
easy. Smokers know they’ll end up
with rusted bodies. The skin leathers
itself in a tar brine. Mouths turn to
rotted wood. The throat becomes

gnarled, sometimes requiring a surgi-

cally implanted blowhole. If you’re
lucky enough to escape the mechani-
cal larynx, your gruff voice will only
sound clear in compatison to the pull-
start of a carbureted lawnmower.
Yet, people still light up.

The addiction is powerful. Harvard
studies found that cigarette compa-
nies increased nicotine content by
about 11 percent from 1997 to 2005.
Those companies will likely continue
this practice to retain their indentured
servants, I mean, customers. Most
nicotine leaves the body within four
days, according to the Ametican Can-
cer Society, but furious physical and

psychological factors linger. Smokers
are addicts, and addicts need to be
addicted to something —— anyone
considering quitting should ﬁnd a
“healthy” addiction like exercise or
competitive celery—eating.

Smoking is more than an addiction,
too. The stress relief, socialization and
even a certain counterculture allure
genuinely make it enjoyable — non-
smokers should understand that.

Also, quitting has its own detri-
ments. Your lungs and body have
to purge themselves of the damage
you’ve already done This sounds fan-
tastic in theory, but reality isn’t so rosy.

It’s like having a bad cold —— cough-
ing, aching and almost everything else
listed on the NyQuil bottle — just
with salubrious effects.

You’re getting better in the long
term, but feel worse in the short A re-
verse logic hits you that if you smoke
again, you can make the sickness dis-
appear.‘ It  but it just suppresses
this baneful healing process.

If you quit, you’ll gain weight,
lose sleep and suddenly your entire
world orbits perpetually recomrnit-
ting to quitting — you might even’
find yourself  about it in some
pathetic attempt at catharsis. You’ll

want to smoke just one cigarette to
regain some sense of normalcy in
your life, or at least to stop 
about it. Just one. Then you spend
$6 on a pack, and you’re not going
to let the other 19 cigarettes go to
waste for that price. And the samsara

starts anew. '

It’s lame. It’s the smokeless Inferno

Empathetic justices distort true meaning of Constitution

 
    
 

by Mark Kozlowski
C0[lU7lIlll1l'

With justices as old and esteemed
as the very architecture of the build-
ing, the Supreme Court will once
again enter the public light with
President Obama’s nomination of
Sonia Sotomayor.

In picking Sotomayor, Obama
tried fulﬁlling a pledge to appoint
justices for their ability to understand
the average schlep, to demonstrate
“empathy.” Sotomayor appears to
have that in spades, but there
are questions as to her ability to in-
terpret law.

It is not advisable to have justices
who are wanton and cruel in applica-

~tion of the law —— justices who might

write their opinions with phrases
such as, “They don’t call me ‘Hang
‘em high Roberts’ for nothing.” But
it’s also not advisable to have justices
who ignore their calling: to interpret
the Constitution, and to uphold it.

The problem with justices acting
out of empathy instead of out of
a sense of the Constitution is that
while the latter is speciﬁc, the former
is vague. The Constitution has been
thoroughly deﬁned, and there are
experts on its interpretation. Differ-
ent people deﬁne empathy in differ-
ent ways, arguably all of them equally
qualiﬁed. justices are not supposed
to be experts on empathy, clergy-
men are.

When a justice rules on the Con-
stitution based on empathy instead
of what it actually says, the justice
creates a problem by fundamentally
changing that founding document.
The opinion of a justice in the
majority becomes a fundamental
part of how other readers and ju-
rists interpret the Constitution. It

V is precedent. It will be cited in the

' future. A justice’s opinion as to what
is compassionate has suddenly be-
come law. _

The end effect is that the Consti-
tution has become incredibly vague,
deﬁned not only by what it says, or
by what a justice believes it says, but

by what a justice believes it should
say. Granted, interpretation calls for
certain ﬂexibility in the Constitu-
tion, but this ﬂexibility should not

be to the extent that the Constitu-

tion changes on a weekly_basis. If
the law is randomized, businesses,
governments and individual citizens
dealing with both of them do not
know how to act in a legal manner.
It is unclear what the law even is.
There is also the sticky question
of accountability. Supreme Court

justices sit on the bench for as long a -

term as they desire. This insulates the
Court from politics, a beneﬁt in most

cases — justices can write opinions A

that are politically unpopular. But
justices who distort the Constitu-
tion to suit their personal sense of
empathy do so ‘without b if

 

ferent View of that hazy concept
In 2005, in Kelo v. City of New
London, the Court handed down a
controversial opinion that greatly
increases the power of eminent
domain. Theoretically, if a com-
munity government believes it can

increase tax revenue by seizing and
redistributing property, it can do so.
I disagreelwith John Paul Stevens
and his sympathy for municipali-
ties over landowners. However, the
only thing I can do is pressure local,
state and federal governments not to
use that power. I cannot remove the
man who gave that power to them.
Worse, precedent.stays around for
some time. Reversing the ruling will
prove just as tricky. '
Empathy does have a place in
government, but that place is not
the Supreme Court. That place is
in Congress or the White House.
These branches change the law
relatively easily, or interpret the en-
forcement of that law differently

attacks was a compassionate goal.
However, millions believed that the
government could have reached this

. compassionate goal in a better way,

which led the Obama administration
to close the camp.

Now, let’s imagine that the Su-
preme Court, agreeing with the Bush
view of compassion and empathiz-
ing with a very real fear of terrorism,
rules that the Obama adrninistra—
tion’s pledge to close the camp is
unconstitutional, essentially forcing
the camp to remain open. Suddenly,
millions of Americans have been
ignored, and those millions cannot
do anything, short of constitutional
amendment, to make their wishes

Cit

Sister to serve up ‘Late N ite Catechism’

by Kathryn Beaty
Strzﬁ’ Writer

’Til Death Do Us Part: Late
Nite Catechism 3
City Theatre
41 9-431 -2489
Performances begin May 27, 2009.

-Sister is coming to Pittsburgh,
and you better listen to what she
says.

Kimberly Richards returns to
Pittsburgh’s City Theatre as “Sis—
ter,” a nun, in the third installment
of the Late Nite Catechism series.
The play is based on the idea of
audience members “attending” a
catechism class taught by Richards’
character, who uses comedic im-
provisation and audience interac-
tion to entertain and educate.

“’Til Death Do Us Part: Late
Nite Catechism 3” operates on
the same basic principles of the
popular “Sister Act” movie series
— that nuns can shake things up
and have fun while still being dis-

ciplinarians.

By exaggerating her enforce-
ment of Catholic behavioral
standards, Richards uses humor
to illustrate ideas that are usually
approached from a serious per-
spective.

When the show starts, Rich-
ards instructs audience members
on how to behave properly.

She tells women wearing low-
cut tops to cover themselves more
appropriately, and she requires a
Hail Mary for anyone staring at
his own feet while walking.

Because a different group of

audience members attends and .

contributes to each show, improvi-
sation is the play’s key ingredient.

“Even though we have a script,” , *

Richards ‘said, “in eight years, I have
never done the same show twice.
There is a huge repeat audience
due to the fact that people know
that something different happens
every night.”

At the end of each show, Rich-

Musical

creates
disco-lgia

by Jared Spears
For T /25 Pitt New

8—Track: The Sounds of the

’70s
CLO Cabaret
Running now through September

When Rick Seeber ﬁrst thought
about creating a musical that would
showcase music from the 1970s, he
only wanted “the good stuff, not
the iconic dreck.”

And if Pittsburgh CLO’s newest
production at the CLO Cabaret,
“8—Track: The Sounds of the ’70s,”
is any indication, he succeeded.

This notion is common among
the alumni of the so—called for-
gotten decade —— folks who seem

V quick to abandon the disco fever

that swept our nation some 30
years ago in favor of a more elu-
sive collection of music.

The ‘music that many of our
parents or teachers fondly remem-
ber, seerningly lost amid the se-
quins and disco balls, has ﬁnally
been unearthed and will be per-
formed with all the excitement and
splendor of its glory days.

And if all you want to do is
“Get Down Tonight,” “8—Track”
promises a little bit of that, too.

“8—Track” has, in some ways,
been a long time coming to Pitts-
burgh. It has already enjoyed suc-
cessful runs in 25 cities across the
country. What makes the CLO
Cabaret’s production special is the
inclusion of two local university
students in the cast.

Tess Primack and Tess Soltau,
both performing arts students at
Carnegie Mellon University, have
lead roles in “8-Track.”

Many performance students
attempt to work professionally
before graduating,’ Primack said,

ards chooses two couples to com-
pete in a dating game, in which she
tests the couples of how well they
know their partner.

The show also has another in-
teractive part — a question-and-
answer session. Richards said it
terriﬁed her when the show started,
because she never knew what peo-
ple would ask. But there are the
“usual” «questions that Richards
hears each night, such as, “Do you
think "priests should be allowed to
marry?” .

“Basically you say, ‘Well, you
know, if they really, really, really
love each other,’” she said.

The ambiguity of a simpliﬁed
answer with a twist represents the
way the show in general. is able
to approach serious topics with

humor while also subtly nudging '

at the policies of the Catholic
Church. ’ ,
While some might consider the

show irreverent, Richards said it
has full support from nuns and
the Catholic Church, and nuns are
some of the show’s biggest fans.

Richards also said nuns in the
audience will probably get in trou-
ble during the show just as much
as anyone else —-— perhaps even
more.

One of her favorite stories, she
said, focused on a nun who kept
talking without raising her hand
during the show, an offense that
Sister punishes by demanding a
dollar ﬁne each time.

The nun violated the rule so of-
ten that she joked she should have
taken a vow of silence instead of a
vow of poverty. The nun’s reaction
might illustrate the show’s intended
reception, because it was originally
written as an ode to nuns and the
Catholic Church. The series was
written in 1993 by Vicki Quade and
Maripat Donovan, also the show’s

original star.

Currently, Richards said, about
15 actresses across the country play
the role of Sister in the show, and
each brings her own experience to
the material.

Richards, who lives in San Fran-
cisco, attended Catholic school
when she was younger. She said

she draws from these experiences _

for her role.

Richards said Catholics are not
the only audience members who
will feel entertained by the show.‘

“Anybody that went to school ‘

and had any kind of strict teacher
will get it,” Richards said. “There’s
really nothing to get. It’s just a fun
evening and it’s a game. And ‘in

the game, Sister’s the boss. So do .

whatever Sister says.”

A collection is taken at the end
of each show to beneﬁt local or-
ders of retired nuns.

year.
With the inﬂux of new players,
Pitt easilycould have had a down

“year 2.8 tl'1C teammates gOt accus-

tomed to playing with one another.
But Jordana said the team’s chem-
istry started solid and remained that
way all year.

“When you are successful re-
cruiting these types of players -
a kid that wants to achieve in the
classroom as well as on the ﬁeld,
it makes team chemistry easier to
achieve,”t]ordano said.

The Panthers returned key play-

‘ *’ers from last year’s team‘,_as well, in-

cluding inﬁelderjoe Leonard, short-
stop Danny Lopez and Kielty.

Kielty said the 12—run loss to
West Virginia in the Big East tour-
nament was a tough way to end his
career at Pitt.

“It wasn’t very fun going out that
way and losing that badly,” Kielty
said. “At the end of the game, it
was pretty emotional because it’s

‘the last year that this group will be

together.”

jordano shared Kielty’s disap-
pointrnent.

“I believe we were better pre-
pared and ready to make some noise
at the tournament,” jordano said.
“However, we made some mistakes
that we did not make all year. We
were the best ﬁelding team in the
conference and one of the best in
the country. We did not play well
defensively in the tournament and
at critical times made mistakes that
cost us.”

But jordano also said it was im-
portant his younger players got the
exposure to the tournament, as he
feels next year’s team will be a tal-
ented bunch.

“The core of the team is intact,
and we had a very solid recruiting
class,”]ordano said, “Depending on
the MLB amateur draft, we could
have one of the most talented teams
we have ever had moving into the
new stadium.”

much-needed depth.

That’s good news for Luxbach-
er, who said he liked what he saw
on his revamped roster.

“All in all, I feel our incoming
class is very solid,” Luxbacher said.
“We have a solid group of players
returning, so the addition of Mike,
Alex and Keegan will ﬁt well with
that group.”

For Luxbacher, the three new
pieces to the team will be a matter
of quality, not quantity, as the team
tries to build on a Big East tour-
nament qualifying season despite
losing ﬁve important players.

“Though small in number, it
will add to the depth and overall
strength of our squad,” Luxbacher
said.

Naturally, each player brings
a different element to the team.
And Luxbacher said he liked what
he saw from his newly acquired
talent.

Among the team’s more press-
ing issues was goaltending, and
Gunderson delivers on that end.
