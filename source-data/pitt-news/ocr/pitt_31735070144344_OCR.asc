Sparta E‘/()L'f()I‘

The
Tribune-Review re-
ported last night
.~ that Pitt star tailback

LeSean McCoy will
(’ skip his junior season

    

" .2 and declare to enter
LeSeanMcCoy the 2009 NFL Draft.

On Monday, Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt said he expected Mc-
Coy back next season. But citing
unnamed family sources of Mc-
Coy, the Tribune—Review reported
that McCoy will meet with \X/annst—
edt today to announce his plans to
leave.

While still a sophomore at Pitt,
McCoy played a season at Milford
Academy in New Berlin, N.Y., thus

making him three years removed.

from high school and eligible for
the draft. "
Pitt spokesman  Borghetti
could not conﬁrm whether McCoy
was planning to leave. -
A two-time all—Big East selec-

A tion, McCoy rushed for 1,488 yards

and scored 21 touchdowns last
season. He was the team’s second
leading receiver.

If McCoy does enter -the draft,
he’ll be the third Pitt player to leave
early in the last four years. Larry
Fitzgerald, who also had a year of
prep school before attending Pitt,
left the Panthers after his sopho-
more year and was drafted by the

Arizona Cardinals with the No. 3 j '

overall pick. Darrelle Revis left Pitt
in 2006 and was the No. 14 pick of
the New York Jets.

McCoy would also be the ﬁfth

underclassrnan running back to

declare for the draft this year.

. Ohio State’s Chris \X/ells, Georgia’s

Knowshon Moreno, Connecticut’s
Donald Brown and Iowa’s Shonn
Greene all -announced they would
enter the draft.

He’s expected to be a late first-
round or early second—round pick.

  ‘Pitt police chief Tim Delaney
said there are several reasons the

“The economy. There’s a wid-

Groups take to the streets for peace

by Caitlyn Christensen
Staﬁ’ WrL'ter

Two opposing demonstra—
tions gathered at the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard yesterday evening in
reaction to the Israeli ground
invasion in Hamas—occupied Pal-
estine. , '

‘Pitt Students for Justice in
Palestine arrived f1rst.. Approxi-
mately 50 members of the or-

’ ganization, unaffiliated students,‘

staff and community members
turned out at" the peak of the
protest, waving Palestinian flags,
chanting and distributing ﬂiers
in protest of Israel’s siege upon
the Gaza strip. The vigil began

at 5 p.m. and ran until just after‘

7 p.m., with numbers decreasing
as temperatures dropped.

Pitt staff member Amy Hasan
held a sign condemning Israel’s
war crimes. Other signs dis-
played messages such as “Peace
Through Unity” and “Stop the
Injustice.”

When the traffic light fac-
ing the cars on Forbes Avenue
turned red, demonstrators ran
out on the cross walk chanting
and holding their signs high‘.
Some of the attendees wove be-
tween the cars. '

Following week-long air
strikes, Israel moved ‘ground

forces into the Gaza strip Sat-
urday with the intended goal of
~overturning the Hamas infra-

structure and taking control of

Hamas rocket launching sites,

which were ﬁring explosives into

southern Israel. ,
Jonas Moffat, president of

Pitt Students for justice in Pales-
tine, said that the organization is
not ‘anti-I srael.

“We have nothing against Is-
rael as a country, just the Israeli
army,” said Moffat. ‘

Protesters said that seeking
peace in Gaza does not mean
they support Hamas retaliation
in Israel. ‘

“The Israeli occupation since
’47 has been incredibly bru-
tal,” said Josh Ulrich, a Pitt se-
nior. “The fact that Palestine has
survived is retaliation enoug .”

Across the street at Schenley

' Plaza, a second, smaller coalition

of about‘ 25 students gathered
behind an ‘Israeli flag.

“I wouldn’t call us pro-Israel,
but pro—peace,” said freshman

Eric Hoerger.

Freshman Becca Tanen
agreed.

“Through peace, we will im-

i prove the quality of life of peo-

ple in Gaza,” said Tanen.

In first year, drink tax

revenues overﬂowing

by Alex Avakian
S W//‘titer

The drink taxi in Allegheny

 County brought in more money
 than expected, and Allegheny
 County Chief Executive -Dan On-

orato said he believes that the rev-
enue can help improve infrastruc-
ture,‘  addition to the staggering
Port Authority. .

“Our interpretation of the state

 law, Act 44, said the drinktax could
 be used to support transit systems

 in Allegheny County,” said Kevin
 Evanto,i spokesman for Onorato.

“Now, we interpreted transit sys-
tems to mean roads, bridges and

 mass transit.”

But a la\ivsuit’s ruling last week
y Common Pleas Judge Judith

F. Olson decided the $12 million
surplus could be spent only on the
Port Authority as originally stated,
not on roads and bridges.

The reason that Onorato be-
lieved he could use it for broader
road and bridge repair is because
buses use county roads and bridges
alongside commuters and commer-
cial vehicles. Onorato has chosen
not to appeal the ruling. _

Allegheny County imposed the
10 percent  tax in December
of 2007, but it'reduced the tax to
7 percent, which took effect Jan. 1
of this year. A - C

But the workers of the industry
are still feeling the squeeze.

To some, drink tax perks 5

outweigh the higher tabs

Drink tax, page 2

Dvorsak, owner of the Pittsburgh Cafe on
Meyran Avenue.

“I deﬁnitely noticed a decrease in business.
It hurt the whole industry. \X/e’ve run a lot less
dollar drink specials. I’m the owner, but I’m
also a bartender too, and I noticed that tips
went way down.” ‘

And Santo Dinardo, who owns Bootleg-
gers bar on Atwood Street, has said that the
tax has hurt his business all year long.

“It didn’t help at all. It discouraged some
people from coming out all together, maybe
even just out of spite,” said Dinardo.

To consumers like Pitt seniorjorclan Hen-
ning, who frequents the bars almost every
night, “It’s not that big of a deal.” As a Pitt
student, Henning relies on his ID as a bus
pass and counts on Port Authority busses to
be there for him. '

“I’d rather pay tax on my pitcher than not
be able to take a bus Downtown,” said Hen-
ning. _ i I

But while the tax might be a matter of
dollars and cents for one person, to the bar
and restaurant industry of Allegheny County,
the tax is $544 million in lost revenue to the
county. '

Onorato has said that the prime alternative
to the drink tax would be to raise Allegheny
County property taxes, something that he has

claimed he is adamant to avoid and feels that _

the tax is not- as biased as opponents 
“One thing that I think they confuse in the

_ issue is they say that it’s a tax on the hospitality

industry of bars and restaurants,” said Evan-
to. “It’s not. Visitors of Allegheny County,
people not only from the counties around us
but other states and countries who come here

'to,,visit and buy a drink in a restaurant or bar,

they’re paying the drink tax. It’s a consumer

tax. It’s no different than if you buy_ food at .

Giant Eagle or you buy a sweatshirt at the Pit
shop. You’re paying sales tax, it’s a consumer

But the alternative viewpoint that many
people share within the hospitality industry is
that the tax is unfair because it targets a specif-
ic group: those who enjoy alcoholic beverages
in Allegheny County bars and restaurants.

As this group dissipates from the bar
scene, so do the net proﬁts of business own-
ers. , J

Sean Casey, president of Friends Against
Counterproductive Taxation, said, .“One seg-
ment of industry is being asked to carry the
entire transportation burden'of the county,
and that really isjust not equitable. And to ask
them to do this during the biggest recession in
close to three generations is unfathomable.”

Kevin Joyce, executive board member of
FACT, said that over the first 48 weeks of the
year, drink sales in ‘Allegheny County went
down, while sales in five bordering counties
saw increases in sales.

“If you were having a new 7 percent tax
enacted upon your business in the worst re-
cession in 70 years, is that a victory?” asked
Casey. “I would say no.”

Demonstrators: US must take action in Gaza

Vigil, page 1

Hasan said that Israel’s mistreatment
of Palestine escalated Hamasl actions.
‘ “Israel is an occupying force,” said
Hasan. “As an occupying force, it has ob-
ligations. What Hamas does is not right,
but if you push a starving dog into a cor-
ner, abuse it and beat it and torment it,
then what do you expect to happen?”

Loretta Riggs, an administrator of the
Universal Academy of Pittsburgh, said
the least she could do was voice her con-

tempt for the offense.

"‘As Muslims, we are obliged to stand
up and speak out about what is wrong. It’s
just an injustice.”

Lea Blumenfeld, a J Pitt alumna who
identiﬁed herself as an ethnic Jew, con-
demned Israel’s treatment of its Arab citi-
zens. ‘ '

“From a people who have known op-
pression for centuries, it is simply abomi-
nable. What Israel is doing isnot keep-

ing with Jewish values or Jewish law,”
said Blumenfeld. ,
“I am here for justice,” she added.
‘Moffat agreed that, people are- not
aligning simply because of their religions.
“This is not a question _of religion,”
said Moffat. “It’s about the human race.”

Moffat said that U.S. inﬂuence on the

world stage is a signiﬁcant force in the es-

- calating violence between Israel and Pal-

estine.

New Year, new you. Right?
' As the clock struck midnight
on New Year’s Eve, I bet that mil-
lions of Americans said goodbye
to 2008 while enjoying their many

' vices. They also pledged that 2009

‘would be the year they would shed

V" those extra pounds, quit smoking,
start to organize messy houses or
get out of debt. But really, what
fun are those? _

So, I’ve devised a list of resolu-
tions that will actually be enjoyable

‘to keep. Fashion resolutions, of
course. Here’s my list for 2009:

1. Do more with less. Be-
fore buying up another shirt, bag
or necklace that will most likely

or the bottom of a dresser drawer,
I will carefully examine my ward-.
robe and accessories. By taking
careful inventory of pieces that

and exciting ways .— and letting‘

go of those items that would look
better on the racks of the South
Side’s Goodwill — dressing will
be easier. Shopping will become
less wasteful when I realize that
I don’t need another white long-
sleeved shirt because I have six

able real estate, in my closet.

2. Get back to ‘basics; Car-
digans, pencil skirts, neutral tones
and handbags in classic shapes --
all very basic clothing elements that

are part of spring 2009 essentials. .

And all very likely to be already

to use this to my advantage. All
of these items pair well with fun
extras. Since I —— and likely you,
too — have a lot of these" fashion
fundamentals already, this leaves
room for some January sale shop-
ping for exquisite pieces at deeply
discounted prices to match up
with the basics. - .

itt professor found himself I

Five years after graduating from
Yale University, MacDonald was far
removed from the stratosphere of
his over-achieving classmates in Sili-
con Valley or on Wall Street Instead
of a meteoric rise in computer tech-
nology or staking our territory as a
real estate mogul, MacDonald lived
in a Baltimore townhouse and spent
most of his free time at ‘a local water-
ing hole, Kisling’s, the staging point
for him and his friends.

‘Tm not the guy who can be the
designated driver,” said MacDonald,
“and I know that about myself.”

Heis,morethananything,anall
or nothing land of guy.

“I couldn’t trust myself to do
things a little bit,” he said. And in the
years after his graduation, that extrem-
ity manifested itself in his social life.

"The dollar drafts that morphed
into 153 shots that somehow became
a $25 hit of Ecstasy, then a bit of rat-
ty  and some meatloaf on
the side,” he wrote of his fun.

The manic indulgence in all or

120 pounds of extra weight and five-

ftgure debts.

“Iguess you could say thatl did my

own personal NASDAQ. I sat there,»

and I blew up, in a sense,” he said.

MacDonald devised a plan. just
a little something he lovingly terms,
‘The Urban Hermit 
Emergency Rotgut: Poverty P ”:
In order to save enough money
to pay back his debt, MacDonald
planned a weekly expenditure of 158,

just enough money to buy 

bang—for—his—buck grocenes. To cut
his expenses, MacDonald consumed

only 800 calories a day, his nut;t:i— 1

tion derived solely from lentils, eggs,
low—grade tuna (“none of that fancy
stuff”), sliced, low calorie cheese and
bread.

His new life style left his bar

wandering in a wasteland of hungry

boredom.

“The experience was extremely
claustrophobic There was nowhere
to turn, nothing to do. Itwas so much
me all the time,” he said. “I’m not
an inherently asocial person, 
is why I think the idea [of the plan]
resonated so much for people,” said
MacDonald. “One way people avoid

really examiningthemselves is inter— -

acting with the world. You can find a
way to calm down and take the edge

off, but when you cut yourself off,

even if you’re'a.fairly normal person,
most people would ﬁnd some 
out that they might not be comfort-
able with.’ ’

that “Urban Hermit” fails to explore the psy- '

Pitt looks to quiet Red Storm

_drew eelan / Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt junior guard Jermaine Dixon takes a jumper against UMBC in

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ’ Writer

For the Pitt men’s basketball

team, one is not the loneliest num- '
ber. It's a spot of envy for the rest _’

of the nation to look up to. J
The Panthers (14-0, 2-0 Big
East) will play their first game in

. the history of the program with‘

a No. 1 next to their name when
they take on the St. John’s Red
Storm (10—4, 1-1 Big East) at the
Petersen Events Center Sunday at
noon. _

The team knows that it cannot
rest on its laurels. If it does, any

. club in theBig East can pull out a
0. Victory.

“In this conference you have
to come out and play every night,”
said senior ‘forward Sam Young
earlier this season.

St. Johffs is a prime example.
It defeated then No. 10—ranked
Notre Dame last week, 71'—65,Ibe-
hind 20 points and 10 rebounds
from D.J. Kennedy.

Even with _the loss of last,

year’s leading scorer Anthony Ma-
son Jr. for the season with a torn
tendon in his right foot, the Red

Storm still features four players,
all sophomores, averaging double-
digit point totals.

The most notable of these
players is Kennedy, a Pittsburgh

native. The sophomore is a com— ’

bo guard—forward who averages
13 points and seven rebounds per
game.

He has been a key part in St.
John’s’ coach Norm Roberts’ ef-
fort to rebuild the program and
bring it back to its glory years in
the 1980s and ’90s under coaches
like «Mike Jarvis and the legendary
Lou Carnesecca.

Kennedy is no stranger to,

winning. He starred on the same

— Schenley High team as Pitt center

DeJuan Blair. That team won a

state championship in their senior A

season.

Complementing Kennedy are
classmates Justin Burrell, Sean
Evans and Paris Horne.

Burrell and Evans are 6-foot—8 4

forwards averaging 10.5 and 10.1
points respectively, while Home is
another multi-dimensional guard-
forward contributing 13 points
per game. _

After accumulating itsfirst Big
East loss, the Pitt’s women’s bas-
ketball team looks to turn things

like to rebound after a tough 77-
69 loss to unranked Providence
Wednesday, the Blue Demons
(12-4, 0-2 Big East) are in the

tory, in addition to breaking a

' two-game losing streak.

When the teams met last year,

While the Panthers would

unranked Pitt dealt No. 15 DeP- 
aul a convincing upset in the 97- _

Pitt's 91-56 victory on Dec. 15. The Panthers play. St. John's Sunday.

68 win. This year, the tables are
turned, as No. 19 Pitt (11-3, 1-1)
seeks a win at home. '

One constant factor in the
matchup between the two teams
is senior guard Shavonte Zellous.
Averaging 23.1 points per game,
Zellous is fourth in the nation in
scoring. ‘ .

The past two ' years, Zellous
scored "a combined total of V 56
points ‘against DePaul, and with
her outstanding performances
this year, tomorrow could be no
different. '

DePaul began the season suc-
cessfully, winning 12 of its first
14 games. The conference sched-'

ule hasn’t been as kind", with its

-first two Big East games against

ranked opponents.

A tough Big East opener at
Louisville initiated the losing
streak, as the Blue Demons fell,
78-60. The second conference

‘ loss came Tuesday night against

Notre Dame, when the Irish de-
feated‘DePaul in Chicago, 86-62.

The ‘ determining factor in
the game will be Pitt’s ability to
maintain momentum by scoring
steadily throughout both halves.
Pitt’s downfall against Providence
was its failure. to capitalize on
leads, allowing the Friars to come
back and regain control.

rs to avoid losing streak

Defensively, the Panthers need
to stop senior forward Natasha
Williams. Williams ranks second
in the Big East and third in the
nation in ﬁeld—goal percentage at
64.2. She could be matched up
against Pitt forwards Sophronia
Sallard, Xenia Stewart or even
centers Pepper Wilson and Kate
Popovec. 1

Deirdre Naughton is. another
offensive threat for the Blue De-

mons. The 5—foot—1O junior guard '

averages 17.2 points and 5.0 as-
sists per game. _ _

She showed her value and irn-
portance in DePaul’s offense in

' 3 ,
Pitt coach Jamie Dixon
The same week Pitt men’s bas-
ketball program is ranked No. 1
overall for the first time in history,
its coach earned a personal recog-

' nition as well.

Jamie Dixon was named the

midseason winner of the 

Phelan National Coach of the
Year Award yesterday.

The award is named for
Phelan, a former coach of Mount
St. Mary’s. In 49 years of coach-
ing, Phelan amassed 830 victo-
ries, good for fourth all-time. The
award is handed out at the Final
Four at the end of the season and
is votedion by coaches, media and

administrators.

Dixon’s Panthers are 14-0  -

perfect in two Big East contests
thus far. Pitt leapt into the top spot
of the national polls after North
Carolina and Connecticut lost for
the first time this season last week.

“Jamie is a very deserving  -

net, said Phelan in a statement.
“Every season, his teams have
been among the best in the Big

, East, and this season is no excep-

tion. The Panthers are a confident,
strong and well—coached team.” ‘~‘

Dixon received six of a possible
18 first—place votes for the midsea—
son award, and his 56 total points
topped second-place ﬁnisher Tub-
by Smith of Minnesota by 22.

Dixon’s career record noxif *
stands at 146-40 heading into
Sunday’s home contest against St.
John’s at noon.

 correct. What wasn’t, however, was the

. Pitt inbounds the ball to Carl Krauser. Krauser
calls a timeout with much more  a full sec-'
_ond remaining, but the clock doesn’t immediately ’
V stop. The officials deliberate, and the announcers
of the game agree that Pitt will receive some-

where around 12 seconds to get a shot off. Pitt
is granted 0.8. A 15-year old Pat Mitsch flips out

inhisparents’familyroom. Soonafter,Knight’s

shot falls  probably at 0.9. Pitt loses when

scoreless for the first time in her career.
In the past, Pitt found success against
DePaul by slowing the game down and ap-
plying_fu1l—cou1;t pressure. A similar game
plan could force the Blue Demons into

turnovers and bad shots, but the Panthers -

must ﬁnish stronger on the offensive end
than they did against Providence.
The Panthers whiffed in coach Agnus

Berenato’s‘ first attempt at her 101st vic-
tory with the program. Berenato is 100-69
through ﬁve and a half seasons. _ _

Meanwhile, DeP'aul holds a veteran
coach of its own. This year, is Doug Bru-

a 426-246 career record, all at his current
school. . ‘
