Ad Hoc Faculty Committee
Proposes Racial Changes

byVIRGINIA JOYCE

“To date, there’s been a lot of
talk and not too much action. But
the recognition of the problem
of racism at the University will
lead to something being done,”
commented John Frazier, a mem-
ber of the administration staff of
the Book Center.

Frazier, along with eighteen
other faculty and administration
personnel, supported a petition
which declared the University to
be a “racist institution” and pled-
ged “correction of the situation.”

The so—called “ad hoc” com-
mittee held its fifth meeting Mon-
day night and found its ranks ex-
panding to 25 active members.
Dr. David Bramhill began the
committee meeting by giving a
capsule history of the group’s pro-
gress. '

Bramhill revealed that a peti-
tion, presented by Dr. Henry
Finm, led to an unanimous re-
solution of the Faculty Senate on
June 3. The resolution “commit-
ted the University to move to
correct the sins of omission and
commission on campus,” report-
ed Bramhill.

“Since some faculty members
thought that an independent push
was needed,” Bramhill continued,
“separate meetings were held to
discuss waysto improve the situ-
ation.”

The next step, according to
Bramhill, was to discern the in-
terests of the Black community.
Representatives form the Black
Action Society (BAS) met with
the committee. A second session
integrated the interests of Black
community leaders. “Both ses-
sions were full of ‘tell it like it
is’ , ” evaluated Bramhill.

These discussions led to the or-
ganization of five task forces,
manned by committee members.
The five topics for re-evaluation
included:

—Academic Programs at Pitt

—Pitt and the Labor Market.

—Pitt and the Public Schools.

—Involvement with the Communi-
ty in other problem Areas.

-—The University’s own problem of

Racism.

There will be simultaneous
“movement” of the task forces.
Priorities have not been asigned.

Outside the “ad hoc” faculty
committee, conscientious efforts
are producing a gain in the black
student enrollment and the num-
ber of black faculty members at
the University. As of the fall term,
the black faculty has been expan-
ded to 42.

September, 1968, will also see
65 black students enrolled here
as opposed to 22 in 1967, practi-
cally a 300 per cent increase. Or-
ientation for these students has
been arranged by the BAS.

Dr. Robdrt Gibson, one of the
coordinators of the movement,
praised the BAS glowingly for its
efforts thus far. “The BAS is do-
ing a magnificent job of taking
immediate responsibility on short
notice. It has found teachers and
offered suggestions for ad-
missions and courses. There is no
comparable group working in so
effective a manner.”

Changes in curricula and texts
are in the offing. Courses in Afro-
American history, set up on a pass-
fail basis, are bding coordinated.
Black students will take Englsih
courses taught by black graduate
assistants making use of black-
culture material. The Anthro-
pology Department is adding

Talk Is Meaningness In
Curing “Sick Society”

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

There seems to be a consensus
of opinion that American society
today is “sick.” People mouth the
phrase “sick society” as if it had
a cleansing effect, as if admit-
ting that a problem exists will
make that problem vanish into
the proverbial cloud of dust.

No one has ever bothered to
define the phrase “sick society.”
What are the characteristics of a
“sick society?” How does a so-
ciety that is “sick” compare with
one that is “healthy?” _

This tendency to classify socie-
ty as sick is part of the newly-
developing and fast growing syn-
drome of paying lip—service to a
problem while actually doing
nothing to correct it. Step one:
Agree that a crisis is impend-
ing. Step two: Label it, and think
that the problem is solved. Step
three: Sit back and watch it grow.

cial upheaval, social revolution,

the generation gap . . . . . . The
list of impressive-sounding, but
actually meaningless, labels is'un—
ending.

These phrases have taken on a
ring of emptiness through lack of
understanding, overuse, and gen-
eral misuse. A topic is discussed,
debated, dissected, and tossed a-
round more than the Globetrot-
ter’s basketball. Eventually, the
problem grows to monstrous pro-
portions. While everyone is busy
discussing solutions (but only on
an intellectual level, of course)
the problem grows beyond the
small minority sincerely trying to
correct it.

Instead of this phrase - mouth-
ing, decisive action should be tak-
en to solve a problem when it
arises. After Robert Kennedy’s
death, everyone agreed that so-
ciety is “sick” yet no one has tak-
en any steps to cure this sick-
ness. The president appointed a
committee to study violence, and
everyone was satisfied. Congress
drew up a watered-down crime-
control bill. Yet, these actions
seem to evadethe actual problem.

ed in the minds of Americans and

Current plans of the Book Cen-
ter include the addition of a sec-
tion “devoted to the Blacks by

“We have to do away with the
hostile environment, “stressed
Gibson. “When a student is ac-
cepted here, we must give him
whatever help he needs or wish-
es, in a beneficial way.”

Donald Hugh Smith
Appointed Director

Dr. Donald Hugh Smith,

a prominent Black Educator

and scholar, has been appoin-
ted director of the Univer-
sity’s new office of Univer-

sity-Community Educational Pro-
grams (UCEP).

In announcing the new appoint-
ment, Dr. Posvar said, “It is hop-
ed that creation of this new
office will permit the University
of Pittsburgh to strengthen its con-
tributions to the solution of one of
society’s most critical problems:
the provision of adequate educa-
tional opportunity to all citizens.
We are very gratified to findsome-
one so qualified to work with us
toward that goal.” His appoint-
ment was announced in coordin-
ation with the Black Action So-
ciety.

Steele Gow Named

Assistant

Dr. Wesley W. Posvar, chancel-
lor of the University, announced
today that Dr. Steele Gow, Jr.
will return to the University this
fall to become the University’s
first assistant provost for instruc-
tional experimentation.

Dr. Gow, who is currently vice
president for planning and devel-
opment and professor of political
science at Bucknell University,
was a member of the University
staff from 1957 to 1965. His new
duties here this fall include dir-
ecting a projected Division of in-
structional Experimentation,
whose purpose will be to develop,
test, and demonstrate improved
programs of higher education.

    

DR. STEELE GOW, JR.
Assistant Provost

Provost

Dr. Gow will also serve as Ex-
ecutive Director of the Univer-
sity Learning Research and De-
velopment Center. In announcing
Dr. Gow’s appointment, Dr. Pos-
var said that an especially close
relationship will exist between the
Division of Instructional Experi-
mentation and the Learning Re-
search and Development Center.

Individual faculty members in
University Schools and depart-
ments will be encouraged and as-
sisted to conduct experiments in
the Division.

The Division, according to
Chancellor Posvar must be an in-
strument which can respond to rap-
idly and effectively to felt needs
among faculty and students for
curricular innovations thus pro-
viding the necessary means for
testing and evaluating promising
proposals, whatever their source.

Dr. Gow, a long-time resident
of Pittsburgh, is,a graduate of
Williams College and the Univ-
ersity, where he received the doc-
tor of philosophy degree in 1951.
Before joining the University’s
faculty in 1957, he spent 15 years
in newspaper editorial work with
the Troy (N.Y.) Record, The Pitts-
burgh Press, and the Pittsburgh
Post Gazette.

As director of UCEP. Dr.
Smith, working through a coor-
dinating committee, will be re-
sponsible for promoting and co-
ordinating the planning and op-
eration of academic programs for
educationally disadvantaged stu-
dents. These programs will invol-
ve both undergraduate and gradu-
ate schools within the University.
Dr. Smith also will oversee_ pro-
jected cooperative ventures be-
tween the University and the ci-
ty’s public schools, as well as
training programs for elementary
and secondary school specialists,
both aimed at using the Univer-
sity expertise to improve pre-uni-
versity education.

Dr. Smith will assume his du-
ties early in September. He will
report directly to the provost.

Currently, Dr. Smith, is direc-
tor of the Center for Inner City
Studies at Northeastern Illinois
State College in Chigaco.

Dr. Smith, who will hold joint
appointments as professor of edu-
cation and professor of speech, re-
ceived an A. B. in speech educa-
tion from the University of Illin-
ois, an M.A. in educational ad-
ministration from DePaul Uni-
versity, and a Ph.D. from the Un-
iversity of Wisconsin.

He was an Illinois delegate to
the 1966 White House Conference
on Educating the Disadvantaged
and is listed in Who’s Who in
American Education. His doctor-
al thesis was entitled “Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr.: Rhetorician of Re-
volt,” and he is co-author and co-
researcher of a study of Headstart
operations in Cook County, Illin-
ios. He has contributed a number
of articles to scholarly publica-
tions and has spoken at colleges
and universities throughout the
country.

At Northeastern Illinois, Dr.
Smith has held joint appoint-
ments as associate professor of
Inner City Studies, director of
the Experienced Teacher Fellow-
ship Program, and director of the
Center for Inner City Studies. In
the latter post, he has been re-
sponsible for the design and ad-

ministration of a program for
training teachers for the ghetto.

His civic activities include
membership in the Peoria Urban
League, the Illinois Commission
on Human Relations, the Lawn-
dale Adult Literacy Project, the

  Local Police Officers Give Opinions

Of Guns, Gun Control Legislation

Miss Allen went to the North
Side Police Station in an effort
to obtain police perceptions con-
cerning pending gun control [eg-
islation.

By PEGGY ALLEN

“Guns are like sex — even if
you aren’t allowed to have it, you
can always get it.”

Thus replied an officer at the
North Side Police Station when
asked his opinion on the proposed
gun control laws. “During pro-
hibition,” he added, “we had
plenty of gun control laws. They
didn’t work. More guns were sold
through the black market than are
sold now.”

A few of the policemen at the
North Side Station felt that the
gun laws would be beneficial.
“Nobody should carry a gun -

not even a policeman,” said one.
“However,” he added, “I think
that everyone should have a gun
in his home.” Another officer felt
that “no one should have a gun
except law enforcement officials.”

One man said that “a man who
has a need for a gun is in
trouble.”

Several of police felt that gun
laws were unnecessary. “Give
every one a gun” said one, “and
everyone would be afraid of
everyone else and we wouldn’t
have any trouble.”

“It’s a God given ri-ht to have
a gun,” added another desk of-
ficer. “I’d say that 8 our of 10
housdholds on the North Side
have a gun. In fact, you should
have a gun, working on the North
Side like this.” ‘ ~ _

Most of the officers seemed to
agree to one thing — the present
gun laws we have now are good,”
argued one patrolman, “but they’
re not used. A person caught car-
rying a concealed weapon is us-
ually fined $50.00 and realeased.
This happened to one man that I
arrested and two months after he
was fined, he killed someone dur-
ing an attempted armed rob-
beryfi

“What we really need is a few
honest judges.” added another.
Most of the men seemed to agree
with him. They seemed to be
bitter about the wide spread
charges of police brutality. “Peo-
ple think that it’s immoral if a
policeman uses his gun, but they
don't even think about it if a cri-
minal uses a gun on us.”

The B.A.S.

The recently formed Black Action Society (BAS) is fund-
amentally an organization geared to the interests and identifi-
cation of black students at the University.

The BAS is an organization that is black oriented. Conse-
quently, it is the legitimate spokesman for all the feelings,
gripes, qualmes, and frustrations of black students on campus.
Within their function as the spokesman of the Black Commun-
ity on campus, the BAS has made a number of demands to
the administration of the University.

Unfortunately, the white reaction to these demands has
been hostile.. White students have told The Pitt News that
the BAS has no right to sit in on the selecting committees
for prospective Black faculty members.

The somewhat hostile white reaction, moreover, centers
around the alleged utter hostility of the BAS’s demands. The
demands have been characterized as being “hostile,” “with-
out tact,” or “unreasonable.” Many whites at the University,
it follows, have rejected the demands of the BAS.

The Pitt News finds this reaction abhorent. It reveals, an
overall lack of understanding between the whites and blacks
on this campus. But, more importantly, it brings out into the
open the concealed prejudices of some of the white students
at the University.

White students at the University should realize that the
BAS is keenly aware of the squalor and poverty of the black
man; they are keenly aware of the only method by which they
can achieve true equality—a strong pride in black culture.
Whites, here, can longer give the black student a paternalistic
helping hand. This will be rightfully rejected, by the BAS.

The Pitt News maintains that black students should
have some say in the evaluation of future black professors. It
is necessary that future black professors be black rather than
Negro oriented.

The BAS is classified as a student organization. But it is
a unique group with a complete black orientation. And with
this premise, the white students at the University must real-
ize that the BAS has to achieve its ends through its own
actions. i

Dr. Smith

The recent appointment of Dr. Donald Hugh Smith marks
the beginning of a new trend of expertise at the University.
And that trend can be identified as “black expertise’,’for Dr.
Smith is indeed a qualified expert concerning the black
man’s problems in the ghetto.

Dr. Smith will be directly involved with future ventures
of cooperation between the University and the city schools
as well as training programs for elementary and secondary
school specialists. These community oriented programs will
utilize the expertise of the University in the attempt to im-
prove the deleterious effects of “ghetto education.” This is an
important step in the right direction. Finally, the University
is taking on the full responsibilities of an urban institution of
higher learning.

The prominent black educator begins his duties at the
University with an impressive list of achievements and quali-
fications. At Northeastern Illinois, Dr. Smith held the joint
positions of professor of inner city studies and director of the
Experienced Teacher Fellowship Program, and director of
the Center for Inner City studies.

Dr. Smith is expecially qualified for his new duties, for
the study of the inner city is essentially the study of the black
ghettos that envelop the clean and respectable center city
areas.

Aside from his wealth of knowledge concerning the black
ghetto, Dr. Smith has had a great deal of experience in educa-
tive matters. He has served as consultant to over a dozen pub-
lic school systems and has given his consultive advice to the
Federal Government’s Project Follow Through.

But Dr. Smith’s real value as an expert lies in the fact
that he is a black. This allows Dr. Smith the privilege of
viewing black problems with a black’s perceptions. And this is
an invaluable asset in the field of Community Educational
Programs.

 

A Method

Militancy and Responsibility

The following column represents the personal
views of Student Government President Ken Schnei-
ler on the subject of the Black Action Society.

by KEN SCHUELER

A people until it uses its own talent. takes pride
in its own history, expresses its own culture. and af-
firms its own self-hood, can never fulfill itself.”
Under this statement of purpose, a new student or-
ganization was recognized at the University last
week. The organization, referred to as the Black
Action Society, has stated that it is based on the
principles of Black I self-ex-
pression, education as a tool
to achieve human rights and
support for the aspirations of
a “people” for brotherhood,
quality, and justice.

These are the goals to
which many of us have made
a personal commitment, not
only in the University, but in
our local community and so-
 ; ciety. Under this premise we
have given our support to the
SCHUELER Society’s “Program activi-
ties” which will include a “Black Week” and the
presentation of speakers, films, and other programs
to express Black life in politics, literature, music,
etc.

In the past weeks, the BAS has submitted to the
University a list of demands proposing changes in
curriculum, enrollmant, and other administration
policies. Aside from repeating proposals that were
in the Finck resolution of the Faculty Senate, and
aside from presenting the demands with an emo-
tionally charged impact, the demands are fairly rea-
sonable. Two of these proposals deserve some com-
mentary.

AN INCREASED Black enrollment should be
based on a positive understanding of the role that
higher education can play in furthering the social
and economic development of a people within our
society. It should not be reduced to an ethnic-ratio
numbers game, in which groups insist on a percent-
age enrollment based on population distribution.
Fortunately, this University in its summer project
has proceded on the former assumption.

    

Regarding the Society’s evalualtion of incom-
ing Black professors. one point is imminently clear.
A Faculty member who comes to this University
is involved in at least two roles. He is an acade-
mician who teaches, does research, and publishes
and participates in other activities of his profes-
sion. He is also an individual who brings with him
his own perceptions, beliefs, values and goals. In
the case of a Black faculty member, he is a repre-
sentative of a distinct ethno-cultural minority in-
volved in an active political, cultural, and social
movements in this country. No matter what his
field is a professor and a Black and in his latter
role, he is a projection of all that is embodied in
the concepts Negro, Black and Afro-American.

If the Society’s demands were launched as a
ballon d’essai to gauge their power, it should be
now clear to them that improvements in our Uni-
versity and society will depend on understanding
and cooperation, not a carte blanche acquiscience
to militant demands. The Society refers to the Uni-
versity as a “racist and hostile environment,” but
the only hostility that is present has resulted from
the injudicious and antagonistic rhetoric of the So-
ciety. “White racism,” like the phrases “honkie
power structure,” “Protestant ethic” and “Student

Power,” conveys nothing more than an emotive
meaning and will subsequently elicit nothing more
than hostility. Changes within our University and
Society are not going to procede on a “mea culpa”
principle, or any other charge imperative. As Mich-
ael Halberstan wrote in the N. Y. Times, “the per-
son who is moved to help the Black by guilt feel-
ings will continue to do this work until he feels
better —- not until the Black is better.” There is a
need for collective understanding and direct act-
ion to rectify an intolerable situation. But under-
standing and cooperation will not be achieved
through the power levers of physical or verbal
threats to destroy an institution.

If we are to live in the apartheid of which the
Riot Commission warns, we must each be militant
in our persistency to cure the moral and political
disease which denies millions of our citizens their
fundamental rights. But we must also be responsi-
ble in the means which we choose to reach this
end. Our intent is to alter, to repair and to improve
our ailing society — not to destroy it.

How Our Readers See It . . .

Grad Student Raps BAS Threat

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read the statement of the
Black Action Society regarding
its key demands to the university
with much interest. I found that
I was in sympathy with a few —-
not all, of course - of their de-
mands, but must admit that their
conclusion that the “university
should not be allowed to function
unless the demands are immedi-
ately met” is illogical. I also feel
that such conclusions are unfor-
tunately arrived at by most stu-

dent power activists.

It is a healthy student body
that questions the administration
and that offers constructive sug-
gestions regarding activities
which do involve the students.
However, if the administration
does not for some reason accept
the advice or demands of a stu-
dent or student organization,
those students who find the situ-
ation intolerable should not
threaten the university and the
rights of other students, but

ON CAMPUS

 

MILIITLE MAN

  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 

  

should more logically leave the
university and find a better one-
take their business elsewhere!

Furthermore, I feel that if any
students were to physically dis-
rupt the university as they did at
Columbia for example, they
should be politely but firmly ex-
pelled.

There are too many qualified
students who wish they could at-
tend such first class schools as
Pitt, but for whom there is no
room.

I hope that the concluding
statement of the BAS is not meant
to be such a threat, and I hope
that the “student power” activ-
ities being advocated by the Pitt
News for the Fall term do not
implicitly carry a threat of repri-
sal.

GEORGE MCKENZIE
Terribly happy

New Way
To Dodge
Proposed

A new way to avoid the draft
has been devised by the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) with the cooper-
ation of the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA). The latest idea is a
training program in financial
management.

However, there is a catch. Pro-
spective candidates must pledge
three years of service to HEW
after training is completed. This
minor deterrent is offset by more
appealing incentives. One is the
salary. During the entire period
of the educational training, can-
didates will receive a salary of
$5,565.

The second delicious incentive
is draft deferment during the
complete training period and dur-
ing the three-year HEW service.
After this time has elapsed,
the candidate will probably be
too old and the cause of worry

 

Sent To Reds’ Sarasota Team;

No Contract Terms Disclosed

By GEORGE LIES
Asso tiate Editor

George McKenzie, who probably was considered the poor

man’s baseball player during the varsity season, may now
be considered the lucky man’s baseball player. 

McKenzie, the baseball team’s regularcenterfielder,signed ’

a professional contract with
Cincinnati Reds for an undis-
closed amount.

Unlike Dave Welty, who
was tabbed as an All-American
early in the year and then fiz-
zled to a .256 batting average, Mc-
Kenzie received little publici-
ty during the team’s 16-9 season.

But by year’s end, McKenzie
had more than doubled his sopho-
moric .156 batting average. This
year, McKenzie hit .316 and own-
ed three homeruns and 10 runs-
batted in.

Last year, he hit .283 with nine
rbis.

It was a steady climb to the
‘300’ mark, and to the profession-
al contract.

“He’s had a lotta luck, a lotta
help, and a lotta advice,” his
mother said.

“George has alwass been a
mild - mannered and an even-
tempered boy. And he was al-
ways ready to have somebody
show him something,” recalled

ball game will be against the

for good material to supply pro-
fessional baseball teams, the Reds
plan to study McKenzie’s possi-
bilities and potentialities.

“It’s up to George,” said his
mother. “He told me when he
left Sunday (McKenzie signed
Saturday) that if nothing comes
of baseball this summer, he would
further his education after he
graduates next April. He might
go to Law School.”

“Time will only tell,” she con-
tinued, “but finishing school was
always the main thing with me.”

McKenzie never played little
League. He played two years of
high school ball. Then he played
for the Lawrenceville Tigers, last
year’s Pittsburgh Sandlot Baseball
League champs. And then he en-
rolled here on a half scholarship.

“Mr. (Bobby) Lewis said that’s
all he could give him under the
financial circumstances at the
time,” related his mother. “He
received a full academic-athlet-
ic scholarship for his last two
years. Mr. Lewis kept his prom-
ise.”

“George has always enjoyed
baseball. And when Mr. Grey
asked him to sign he was elated,”
his mother said.

“He’s so happy we haven’t
heard from him yet,” his mother
said with a slight chuckle.

As the team’s most valuable
player this year, McKenzie was
named to the second team of the
NCAA Eastern District All Stars.
According to coach Lewis, “this
district (New York — Delaware-
New Jersey - Pennsylvania) is
one of the toughest.”

“George was always one of the
strongest hitters physically,” Lew-
is explained. “He has improved
every year.”

“He was well throught of and
he is a gentleman. On and off the
field,” Lewis remarked.

SDS Loose Organization

Member Explains SDS Organization  

By PHIL SEMAS
College Press Service

“Students for a Democratic Soc-
iety (SDS), says one of its mem-
bers, “is only a national organi-
zation when the national conven-
tion meets.”

Throughout its six-year history,
SDS has always been a loose con-
federation of campus chapters
with varying tactics and ideolo-
gies. The most that SDS has done
at national conventions is to agree
on general tactics, such as the de-
cision last summer to tie the is-
sue of the war to local campus
issues.

Food, Drug

Inspectors

End Study

Thirty-six Food and Drug Ad-
ministration inspectors from all
areas of the U. S. have just com-
pleted a two - week intensive
course in pharmacology at the
University School of Pharmacy.
The inspectors will now spend
an additional week in Washing-
ton obtaining instruction from the
heads of the various bureaus in
the FDA on specific problems in
experimental design and biochem-
ical assays.

The course at the University
provided basic background ma-
terial and experience in pharma-
chology, thus enabling the in-
spectors to communicate effect-
ively with both preclinical and
clinical investigators who are stu-
dying the actions of new drugs.

Dr. Joseph P. Euckley, chair-
man of the Department of Phar-
machology, says the FDA has be-
come extremely critical of inves-
tigations on potential new drugs
that have been carried out in the
past. ple said that drug inspec-
tors will be working directly with
the pharmacologists and clinical
pharmacologists in evaluating
the efficacy and also the ad-
verse effects of new drugs

Within such general frame-
works, local chapters develop
their tactics according to local
situations. Most (but by no means
all (of those who followed
through on last summer’s decis-
ion adopted the ‘tactic of black-
ing Dow Chemical Company re-
cruiters. But SDS as a national or-
ganization made no plans for the
takeovers of campus buildings,
primarily over racial issues,
which have replaced Dow dem-
onstrations as the major tactic of
campus radicals.

This year’s SDS convention,
held at Michigan State Universi-
ty, was expected to be different.
It was the first national SDS
meeting since the revolt at Col-
umbia University, the most suc-
cessful action ever led by an SDS
chapter.

Many SDS leaders felt that
Columbia and the numerous
smaller actions which preceded
and followed it, as well as the
student revolt in France, indica-
ted the beginning of a “pre-re-
volutionary period” to which SDS
would have to adapt, both to take
advantage of conditions and to
meet the repression which they
feel is coming.

Most of the leadership thought
SDS should move toward becom-
ing a revolutionary New Left par-
ty, with the ability to direct the
energies of the student activists
who make up the majority of the
SDS membership into the revolu-
tionary directions in which the
leadership believes.

To reach this goal, the leader-
ship proposed making SDS into
more of a national organization
with the now almost powerless
national office directing the ef-
forts of regional organizers.
Their proposal was defeated.

The defeat came from two
other groups within the organi-
zation, the anarchists and the Pro-
gressive Labor Party.

The anarchists were led by a

non-campus chapter from New
York’s Lower .Side called “Up

Against the Wall, Motherf——ker. ”

The name comes from a LeRoi

Jones poem that begins with those
words and was also the cry of the
Columbia rebels.)

The Motherf—ckers, most of
them bearded and clad in black,
opposed any effort for a strong
national organization which
would be able to impose an ideo-
logy from above. Instead, they
pushed hard for strong regions
within SDS, to be built up from
the local level. They argued, for
example, that the Columbia re-
volt would have been even more

effective if it had been support-
ed by a strong regional organiza-
tion.

A resolution calling on the na-
tional officers to work toward the
goals of the Motherf--ker peopos-
al was approved by the conven-
tion. This was because of the
third major group Within SDS,
the Progressive Labor Party,
which opposed all structural
changes.

Poor Acoustics Hinder
Jazz Performances

by BILL GRAY

If you want to hear good jazz,
or good musical performances of
any kind, don’t go to the Civic
Arena. It isn’t that good musical
performances are not presented
her, it’s just that anyone not rest-
ing his chin on the edge of the
stage cannot hear what the mu-
sicians are playing.

This was the case Sunday night
at the Pittsburgh Jazz Festival.
Most of what I heard was ex-
cellent, but I can only presume
that the rest of the bass solo by
Thelonious Monk’s accompianist
was as good as the one note that
reached my straining ears. To be
absolutely clear in my point, the
acoustics, as is to be accepted in
the jazz, as is to be expected from
musicians such as these, was ex-
ceptionally fine.

Cannonball Adderly opened

with “74 Miles Away” which fea-
tured Cannonball on the saprano
sax and his brother Nat on the
trumpet. His second number
“Somewhere” was quietly dedi-
cated to the late Wes Montgomery,
who was to have played at the
show. “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy”
was naturally included and I was
once more reminded of the pow-
erfully moving restraint attained
by the perfect meld of Cannon-
ba1l’s sax and Nat’s trumpet.

Gary Burton, on vibes, follow-
ed the Adderlys. Even though the

electric “pop” guitar of Burton’s *

group is praised by many, I felt
that at times on Sunday, it COV-
ered Burton’s vibes when it was
not meant to. Hugh Masekela fin-
ished the first half of the evening

with one shoe (proving my old '

belief that it only takes one shoe
to play an exciting trumpet‘:-)

The always hop Herbie Mann,
dressed in eye—squinting white,
was easy to see, if not to hear.
The Mann is sometimes not well
received by students, but I con-
tinue to find his melodisis flute
entertaining.

ces, characterized by solos, are
