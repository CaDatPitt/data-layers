Gresham would like to see

that college students want to

effort of liberals to turn them
into “political pawns for the
nutty fringe.”

“The students’ siibwculture is

Gresham. He feels that students

Fugs Show Maturity With Age

Releasing ‘Tenderness Junction’

by JOE ANDERSON

In their zealous crusade
to bring sex out into the
open, The Fugs have com-
pletely exhausted the An-
glo-Saxon lexicon of obscen-
ity. Through their over-sex-
ed musical sensationalism, they
have caused “sexual freedom”
to become‘ synonomous with
“ubeastial promiscuity.” Their
ﬁrst two albums made the-m
both famous and rich; Tender-
ness Junction, their third album.
is just beginning to stir the
miasma of their neurotic, pre-
pubescent followers.

But to say that Tenderness
Junction is just a continuation
of the Fugian turpitude estab-
lished in their earlier albums is

I I a bit too harsh. There is, sur-

prisingly enough, some really
great material on this record.

To be sure there is still much
of the school boy sex fantasy
prevalent, especially in songs
-like “Aphrodite Mass’ with its
“street gropes” and “throb
thrills” and the typical Fugian
pres-exual nightmare —— “Exer-
cising the Evil Spirits from the

 

Pentagon October 21, 1967.” The
best songs on the album are
those written by Tuli Kupfer-
berg—“The Garden Is Open”
and “Dover Beach.”

“The Garden Is Open” is a
fascinating musical tribute to
the age old garden of love. A
haunting almost mystical ar-
rangement is created by a. basic
folkrock form accepted by the

skilled playing of an electric

violin and the simple, unpreten-
tious (for a change) vocal of

‘ Ed Sanders (It's summer again]

Oh orange and a-we/And gladly
will I fall).

“Dover Beach” is probably the
best song the Fugs have ever
done. Kuperferberg is in com-
plete control of both his music
and lyrics. He says exactly what
he wants to say without resort-
ing to the “how many dirty
words can We use in this song”
style of the previous albums.
The theme “love not war”
though often a cliche is not so
here. The lyrics (While ignor-
ant armiest clash by night/Let
us be true to one another) are
as forceful as they are simple.

“Hare Krishna” is a song that
Allen Ginsberg has been singing
for years at the beginning of
each of his poetry recitals. Now,
combined with electric instru-
ments and the Fug Chorale, Al-
len’s -song is ﬁnally getting the
attention it so rightly deserves.

Up to the release of this al-

bum, the Fugs’ music has been .

characteristic of the naughty
little school boy's behind the
barn talk. Now it seems the
Fugs have toned down a bit.
Many of the songs on Tender-

Editorial: Reflections on Past Promises 

For those of us who are now seniors, our four years at the Uni-

- versity are drawing to a close. Even those of us who have been here

for four years have a tendency to lose perspective and think that our
goals and priorities are unique. This is_ where The Pitt News’ bound
volumes come in handy; by browsing through.a collection of all the
Pitt News’ during the past few years, we regain that lost perspective
and see how universal our needs are.

For example, let us quote the front-page headline from the Sep-
tember 28, 1964, editon of The Pitt News: “SG Unanimously Supports
Student Textbook Discount.” The story continues that “Student Govern-
ment unanimously passed a resolution that the Book Store ‘grant a
reasonable discount’ to all full time graduate and undergraduate stu--
dents for the purchase of textbooks and school supplies.”

If the above excerpt is disheartening, in view of the struggle we
had to establish a student discount this year and the possibility that
the“'admini»stration will try to revoke the watered-down discount we were
granted, let us quote from the October 16, 1964, Pitt News: The story
‘in question deals with the then Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield’s state-

' ments to questions from student leaders on student union and dormitory

plans: “Construction of two new Towers dormitories including a new
Student Center ‘will start in the fall of 1965 with projected completion
in the fall of 1967. They will be located near the present Towers, but
the exact lot cannot be announced until all the land is secured. The
Student Center will probably consist of four floors, two and one-half

above ground and one-half’ below a podium supporting the Towers. All
student activity offices and recreation offices and recreation areas will
be moved there from the Schenley Hall which will then be converted
to a Professional center.” ’

The same article also dealt with parking: “The Chancellor an-
nounced that there are three major parking developments in various
stages of planning to alleviate Oakland parking congestion and the in-
creased i‘nconvenience from the newly installed parking meters. One -will
definitely be in the Medical Center area since Montefiore Hospital's
newly additionknocked out parking facilities on that part of the hill.
The city Parking Authority is working with the Medical Center on this
project, which should be completed by next year, as well.as two other

lots as yet to be designated.”

And in the article, the Chancellor referred to our student body ‘F ‘*

as “more cosmopolitan, out-of-state, with a higher academic quality.”
Perhaps we should sit back and try to pretend that this is the
fall of 1964 and we are freshmen once more. For the value in playing
that game is that we will not know what is yet in store for us; we can
still hope for a fulfillment of the prophesies and plans of four years
ago. We can still hope that more dormitories will be completed, that
we can look forward to a Student Center in our senior year, that park-
ing facilities will be provided, and that our student body will remain

cosmopolitan. .
The only strike against us is the calendar, and after all, what kind

of an obstacle is that?

Letters To The Editor

Mocha Rebukes
‘News’ Reporter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I must take strong exception
to a statement contained in Di-
ane Bloch’s report (The Pitt
News, Wednesday, Feb. 14) on
Professor Pol1ack’s talk on
“World War II and After: Hit-
lerism Comes into Russia.” Par-

si rof E’ollack’s tallk
§§ ii: éﬁssig Bit 2 ‘dz?-mas ii‘:-

vasion of Russia on Stalin’s (an-
ti) Jewish policy, Miss Bloch
says: “In Eastern Europe, local
collaboration was evident in an-
ti-Jewish attitudes. Lithuania,
the Ukraine, and Poland (sic!)
welcomed the Germans because
the Germans would protect the-m
from Russian rule.” I am not
going to enter into a dispute
with a hopelesslly misinformed
undergraduate, but I do think
that a report containing such a
controversial item, and an in-
credibly bad historical error
next to it, should have been
either properlly edited, or clear-
ed with Prof. Pollack.

I am not going to discuss war
time sentiments in Lithuania
and the Ukraine, they are too
involved, but I will say that the
s-o-called “anti-Jewish attitudes”
in Poland have given that coun-
try a bad name undeservedly
since the end of the war. Who
is spreading this vicous propa-
ganda and to what purpose?
The facts are that both the
Poles and the Jews have been
the greatest victims of World
War II.

The Na2i"s reduced the Jew-
ish population from 18 to 12
million-—-by one third. Similarly,
Poland, with 36 million people
at the beginning of the war, was
reduced to 24 million: again by
one third. No other country has
suffered proportionately bigger
losses, not even the Soviet Union,
whose lo-sses of reportedly 20
million people amount to about
one tenth of that country's pop-
ulation. Among Poland's losses
of 12 million were three mil-
lion Polish citizens of Jewish
faith.

Like the Poles, the Jews were

marked for extermination and,

as the figures indicate, the ex-
termination was proceeding at
a terrifying pace. Yet, instead of
keeping forever alive the iden-
tity of the killers, “anti-Jewish
attitudes” in Poland (l) are be-
ing forever brought forth. There
is no country in the world that
did not have at least some “an-
ti-Jewish attitudes” at one time
or another, and nobody will
deny it. But to say that such “iat-
titudes” existed in Poland dur-
ing the last war, and supposed-
ly in “evident colilaboration”
with the Nazis, is going too far.

So far that it can lead to ter-
rifying conclusions in the minds
of the young, and of the misin-
formed. To give an example, a
young Jewish student of mine
asked me once in all serious-
ness why the Poles killed three
million Jews during the last
war. To my horror, he really
believed it! Fed on just such
legends of “collaboration” and
“attitudes,” and accidentally
knowing that Auschwitz (Oswie-
ci) happens to be in Poland, he
added two and two together!

But he knew nothing of Po-
ﬂ.and’s ﬁne record of religious
tolerance, includin-g giving shel-
ter and protection to the Jew
since the 14th century. Neither
did he know that each isolated
incident of anti-Semitis-m in P0-
land is more than matched by
dramatic stories of protecting
the Jews at the risk of life
(some of these stories have
found their way to American

newspapers and TV), and that

the Israeli government is for-
ever awarding medals to Polish
citizens who have helped the
Jews during the darkest hours
of Nazi occupation.

Sti!ll, all of the above is only
incidental to the terrible error
contained in Miss Bloch’s report.
How could Poland “welcome the
Germans” invading Russia in
1941, when Poland had already
been occupied by the Germans
for the last two years, since
September, 1939? Miss Diane
Bloch! I know that you are
probably a very young person,
‘born after the events, but you
are not writing about the Spar-
tans or the Carthaginians, but
about the very last war we have
had in Europe, and you should
know, as a college student who
is reporting on a talk by a his-
tory professor, that this very
last war started in Poland, that
Poland was its first victim, and

that as its ﬁrst victim, marked ,

for extermination, Poland could
hardirly “welcome" its attackers
two years later. Please!

Student Scores
Ruskay, Others

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter in
protest to the outrageous dem-
onstration at the Honors As-_
sembly Wednesday, Feb. 28. As
almost everyone knows by now,
the assembly was interrupted
rudely and abruptly by John
Ruskay and his cohorts, who
simply took over the meeting.
I've heard of captive audiences
before, but this one was some-
thing else!

Mr. Ruskay spent almost one’

half hour, along with a few
other illustrious speakers, har-
ranguing the audience -about
free speech and the -duty o-f the
college student to protest what
he feels is not right. But none
of the speakers dared say any-
thing about the rights of those
who had come to the Student
Union to honor stduents for aca-
-demic and leadership qualities.

What right had these dissent-
ing students to interrupt a legiti-
mate program to carry on a po-
litical debate? If they wanted
an audience so badly and could
get one in no other way, why
did they not ask the audience to
stay after the assembly, if they
wanted to? Was it necessary to
ruin the ceremonies by turning
them into a PPP rally?

I seriously have my doubts
about the maturity and sincer-
ity of those students involved in
this “staged" performance. I am
as much an advocate of free
speech and student involvement
in major university decisions as
any of the speakers, yet I did
not hear during all the speeches

that were made, any concrete ‘

proposals for change nor any
rational explanation for the in-
terruption. It took singularly
poor taste to do something so
crude and disrespectful of the
rights of others. I believe that
the right to dissent is fundamen-
tal to democracy; I have agreed
with the ri-ght to demonstrate,
debate, and protest, but I can-
not agree that this includes the
right to usurp an audience.

OWL Selections’
Editor, The Pitt News:

Each year after Tap Day cere-
monies are over and all the
awards have ' been announced,
many people complain that they
are dissatisﬁed with the results.
Each year there are a few peo-
ple that are disappointed. This
is unavoidable. But this year,

the selection committees seem 

to have outdone themselves.

Among those honored as Jun-
ior Worthies and members of
the Owl Hall of Fame are many
outstanding student leaders. Un-
fortunately, however, the omis-
sions are equally as outstanding.
Many deserving students were
not tapped: I5‘-rank Tutino, Toni
Grossi, Armand Belly, David

Levitan, Paul Stoller, Joan S.altz-
man, Tom -Meisner, Sue Bloom,
Loren Hershey, and Marjie Ki-
silinsky among them.

L But one omission stands out,
above the others. K-en Freder-

ick was IFC president, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon president, win-
ner of ESCI'I'I‘ award, member
of the Student Affairs Advisory
Committee for two years, mem-
ber of Druids, ODK, Order of
Omega, and president of Stu-
dent Government. How it is
possible for a senior with these
credentials to be rejected by
the Committee of Juniors who
selected the Owl Hall of Fame
is -beyond my understanding.

Selection comm.ittees have a
responsibility to the University.
Hopefully, they set aside their
personal preferences to critical-
ly and objectively select those
who deserve to be tapped be.
cause they have earned the hon-
or. It is not so much that I
challenge the omission of stu-
dents who, in many instances,
are even more qualiﬁed to be
tapped. I realize that it is t-oo
late now to tap these student
leaders, but I sincerely hope that
next year the students on selec-
tion committees remember this
Year’s results and tap those who
are deserving. Otherwise, Tap
Day has no meaning.

The Value of Change from Within

THE LEGENDARY political organization of past notoriety is
virtually nonexistent today. Gone are the days when Boss Tweed
and his counterparts all over the nation ruled their particular do-
mains with an iron hand. They are now replaced by a political
organization that must carefully scrutinize itself and its candidates, in
response to a more aware and independent electorate.

A case in point is the Alle-
gheny County Democratic organ-
ization, who last year refused to
endors-e County Commission
Chairman William D. McClelland
and Prothonotary David B. Rob-
erts for re-election. The two had
years of service behind them, but
were both over 70 with records
in office that were questionnable.
Instead of automatically endors-
ing these men, the Democratic
Policy Committee endorsed form-
er State Sen. Leonard C. Staisey,
45, and State Rep. Thomas Foers-

Sen, Gaydos ter, 39, for the two commissioner
spots, and State Rep. James Clarke, 49, for prothonotary. The subse-
quent victories of these candidates in’ first the primary and later the
general election reinforced the correctness of: the decision of the
Policy Committee to go not only with youth, but youth with creden-
tials.

This year, the Policy Committee stood firm once more and re-
fused to back ailing Congressman Holland for reelection, in spite of
the strong labor support Holland had traditionally rallied and threat-
ened to rally once more. Instead, the Committee endorsed State Sen.
Joseph M. Gaydos, a Liberty Borough attorney, who at 41 has com-
piled an enviable record. Prior to his election to the State Senate in
1966, Sen. Gaydos was the legislative representative for the County
Commissioners to Harrisburg as assistant county solicitor. A graduate
of Duquesne University and Notre Dame Law School, he is a former
assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth and a practicing
attorney.

IN A Pitt News interview, Sen. Gaydos discussed his nomina-
tion for a Congressional seat: “I feel that the trend unquestionably
is to younger, but experienced candidates. The two seem to be the
antithesis of one another, but it isn’t so.” He pointed out that “our
constituency is now made up of younger people, and reﬂecting this
situation, the candidates are now younger.”

Although Sen. Gaydos stressed that “there is no substitute for
experience,” he affirmed that “room must be made for younger peo-
ple. There is a hybrid-type consideration involved, insofar as the
experienced official is needed. Change must be orderly, however,
concerning the operation of government and the party structure.”

Sen. Gaydos’ nomination by the Democratic Party is significant,
for it reflects that change can come rfrom within the system, rather
than necessarily from without. The value of change from within is
that candidates thus chosen usually have the experience in politics
and government necessary to qualify for the position in question,
which if not highlighted during the campaigns, is revealed in the
operation of government during the course of one’s term of office.

A man of Sen. Gaydos’ qualifications being selected by the party
instead of the incumbent who did express a desire to run for re-
election is the best kind of example a political party can set——using
the built-in advantages of a political organization to choose an
imminently qualified candidate.

 “DRAMATIC “REVOLUTION” -

FEDERAL -SCHOOL REPORT says: The Phila-

Reform in Philadelphia is “more widespread and far-reaching

DR. MARK R. SHEDD, new Superintendent of Schools, says:

‘‘I will continue to support teachers who are able to examine, in a

If we divorce school subjects from the guts and hopes of human beings,

we can expect students to find them gutless and hopeless.”

RICHARDSON DILWORTH, President of the Board of Education,

Two Forfeits Help Matmen
Close Season With 5-6 Log

by ROY JACOBS

Although the wrestlers seemingly swamped Syracuse,
31-8, Saturday, the victory at Trees Hall Wasn’t really as
overwhelming as the score might indicate.

Included in the varsity’s total are 10 points for two Orange for-
feits and another five which resulted from Terry Hoover’s pinning a
Syracuse sub who weighed nearly 40 pounds less than he did.

H “It was a good one to get out
of the road,” indicated coach
Dave Adams afterwards. The
win closed the mat team's dual
meet seas-on — Adams’ ﬁrst —-
with a 5-6 record, the best since
1964.

' “We weren’t as high as we
might have been because of the
forfeits,” felt Adams, “but ev-

F rosh Cop Three N a<vy Crowns;
Payne Selected Tourney’s Best

Five of seven freshman wrestlers came home from the Navy Plebe Wrestling Tour-
nament yesterday with three individual titles and two runners-up. No team champion was

named in the 11-school field.

The Navy tournament is generally considered the Easterns for the freshmen.
The frosh champions were Mark Payne at 137, Bob Kuhn at 160, and Gene Reese at 167. Jack Hop-
kins at 145 and heavyweight Ralph Cindrich both copped seconds.
“From the reports I’ve gotten from coach (Bob) Fehrs, .I’m real pleased,” offered coach Dave Adams.

“They all did a good job.”

The way the tournament was structured, all losers immediately enter a losers’ bracket; and the even-
tual winner of the losers’ bracket meets an undefeated wrestler in the finals. The winner is the tournament

champion.

This arrangement worked both ways for the frosh. By getting a second chance at Bill Hartzfield

Richey led through the ﬁrst

has run a 3:56 mile outdoors.
“That was nice,’ Jerry smiled.
“I guess it was the best part of
the race.”

Richey» had impressed Cleve-

his mind was that lingering

“Bair said before that I was
stronger than he, but I'm not.
I tire at the end. I need another
year's work and a- lot more road-
work before I can beat_those
guys.”

Maybe so. But the list of guys
that Richey can't beat keeps get-
ting smaller. “He’s going to be
great,” said Bair. “He’s great
already. He’s improving faster
than the rest of us. I don't know
how much longer it will take,
but he'll get there.”

Besides Richey, six other Pan-

only two of the ﬁve jumpers

buy women's and children's
clothing.

    

it's one of those little
things that mean a lot. To us.
