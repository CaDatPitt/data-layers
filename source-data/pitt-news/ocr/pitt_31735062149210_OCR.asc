Visitors To Hear Dr. Sutherland, Band Play,  Senior Award Winner And Queen

For most University students today is Tap Da_v_. the climax of.’

the year’s activity and the high point in Spring Festival week.
But for many more people, most of whom have never seen the

University before, today is High School L‘)-ay, the occasion upon:

which anywhere from 1,500 to 2,500 students from high schools with-

in a 75-mile radius descend upon the campus to view the festivities, {
participating in a program prepared for them by a special SPA c.0n1- 

mittee, and getting a general idea of what Pitt has to oﬁer.

The majority of the students Will:

consist of Pittsburgh high school sen-
iors. with, according to David Racus-
in, C37, chairman of the committee, a
generous sprinkling of men and wo-
men from other schools in Allegheny,
Westmoreland, Fayette, and Washing-
ton counties.

Opening -High School Day activities
will be an assembly in Memorial Hall
at 1:30 o'clock. In addition to the
high school seniors, who are honor
guests, all University students are in-

vited to attend. After an address of
welcome by Mr. John G. Quick, regis-
trar of the University and director of
high school relations, Dr. John B.
Sutherland, coach of the football
team, will speak to the assembly.

The University ROTC Band, under
the direction of Lee M. Lockhart, will
be present to furnish music, and mem-
bers of the University cheering squad
will lead a number of cheers preced-
ing Dr. Sutherland's address.

View Afternoon Events

After this assembly, the visitors will
be taken to view the activities which
traditionally ﬁll a Tap Day afternoon.
First there will be the ROTC dress
parade on Bigélow Boulevard and
O’Hara Street, an event which will be
followed by the ﬂoat parade in which
women's fraternities will compete.
Next on the program is the interfrater-
nity sweepstakes, to be held on the

The new quarters will be completed
and supplied with the more than 150,-
000 books from the State Hall Library

University students probably on Mon-
day.

When the new library has been in-

 Dance Concludes
 Activities Today

 Will Be Guests At Schenley ;
‘ Tod Rollins. To Play

Traditionally the affair at which
,l7niversit.y students “open up" with
- their new spring outﬁts, and at
which ribbons and keys really come
into their own, the Spring Festival
‘dance at the Schenley Hotel tonight
{promises to add a climatical touch
' to a gala week of festivity.

According to Harry Robinson. C36,
publicity manager. all indications
point to an “affair which will be prac-
tically unique in every respect, a
dance which continues the spring fes-
tival tradition whlle overstepping all
precedents.”

One of the traditions which will be
followed is the issuing of the “Razz
Rag,” a sheet “riding",- many noted
people, and with, gentle satire, polish-
ing oil‘ another year of University ac-_
tivity. Israel L. Goldberg, C36, author
and editor of the Rag, would make no
statements as to its contents. He.
says: “I am not vouching for the
authenticity of any item appearing in
this paper.” Since the Bag has been
shrouded in secrecy, Goldberg; could
only-1-ecominend that “you'll get :1
copy at the dance.”

Robert Mease, chairman, will not
lead the affair tonight, since he will
be in Washington with the golf team.
but has promised that his -' proxy
would be present, and that wherever
he was, he would be dancing from 9
to 1 o’clock. Harvey Goldstein, bu.si-
ness manager, has thus been raised to
commanding gofficer, and will lead
the dance," minus the grand march,
witlt Betty Rosenﬂeld.

Receiving congratulations this eve-
ning will be any number of recently
honored men and women, led by the
Senior Queen and the winner of the
men’s Senior Award. The results of
the afternoon's competition in ﬂoats,
track, and sweepstakes will be an-

A Word To The Guests

E'RE GLAD TO ‘WELCOME the visiting delegation

of high school students that has come to share some
of the Spring Festival VVeek activities with us. VVe
could say to them, “We're glad you've come." We would
rather say, “We hope you're glad you've come." That’s
the real test.

Obviously some 01‘ the visitors may be a bit bewilder-
ed by the strange antics they will see the staid and se-
rene undergraduates perform today.
them recall that in the courses of the college catalogues
they have leafed through they didn’t see listed such ‘items
as “Push-cart racing, 2 credits" or “Float Fixing, 3
credits, with lab."

Naturally, the sort oi’ thing going on today won’t be
taken by anyone as a criterion 01' what happens here
every day. We don't have this fuss and fI‘iV0llt.y as a
steady diet. Because it's fun for us, we hope it's fun
for them to watch these several events.

But in watching these events, we hope that our vis-
itors won't neglect to notice the spirit and the zest
which the participants and rooters alike are putting
into them. And when they observe that spirit and zest
and good fellowship, let them make up their minds that

those things will have a part in their undergraduate life,

whether it be here or elsewhere.

Spring Festival weelis and their wide range of events
liave endured at Pitt and at other universities only be-
cause they have added something of color and spirit
which is not to be found in the classrooms. laboratories,
or libraries.

Now that these a71‘airs have reached the traditional
stage they form -3. balance in the broad circle of under-
graduate life at college.

lt’s not a very broad part of the circle that we're
showing our guests today. They must understand that.
But what they do see we'll hope they’ll like, and that
they’ll like it as a part 01’ colleges and universities.

It might pay us to repeat as Emily Post has proba-
bly said, “If the guests don't have a good time, it's the
1’-.:.ult of the host."

A new publicity stunt has originated at the University

be held there on May 8 is holding a contest with a free

to do to enter is to submit a guess as to what band and
hotel has been selected by the committee. Then the
winner will be drawn from those who have guessed cor-
rectly.

rEdwin F." Goldman Leads Unit
In ‘The Universal Judgment’
For Feature Number

By Robert Brown

‘With Lee M. Lockhart, director of
instrumental music at the University,
and Dr. léldwin Franko Goldman, guest
conductor, directing, the ROTC Con-
cert Bancl put on an outstanding pro-
gram VVednesda_v evening at Carnegie
Music Hall before a capacity crowd.

Probably the most solid musical
achievement of the group was the
rendition of a number that is usually
murdered in‘ the hands of most bands;
R.ossini’s “Overture To Vifilliam Tell.”
It is true that the band t.ransr:.1‘ipti0n
of the first section was not able to
c.i.tch the warmth and tone of the ﬁve
violincelli that usually take this part
in a symphony orchestra, and it is
likewise true that some of the deli-
cate pianistic passages were some-
what out of tune. But the whole
number, and particularly the-second
and last sections. was full of the
ﬂorid storm and ‘stress that the pro-
liﬁc Italian composer (he wrote one
of his best operas in less than two
weeks) was so fond of introducing in
all of his compositions.
soloists impress

For his major work of the evening,
Dr. Goldman led the hand through
De Nardis’ magniﬁcent tone poem,
“The Universal Judgment.” As its
title suggests, the number pictures the
ﬁnal day of reckoning. .W-hen both
saints and sinners must meet’ togeth-
er.. There was lofty grandeur in the
ringing brass chords and delicate ef-
fects, from the woodwind section. Dr.
Goldman seemed almost to pull the
tone out of the instruments in build-

ing .up the smashing close of the
number.
Perhaps the arrangement of the

“Stephen Foster Melodies” had some-
thing to do with the uninspired and
occasionally sloppy performance the
band gave of the number. Foster's
songs, like many of Franz Shubert’s.
were dashed off with relatively simple
accompaniments. The complicated ac-
companiment that this arrangement
calls for somewhat destroys the bean-
tiful melodies.
Soloists were

in profusion at the

concert. Six brass pieces played the
famous sextette from “Lucia,” the
saxophone quartet built up to an

awful letdown in a number of the
same name, and even the two tuba-
ists, sounding like young hippos at
play, rumbled through Hayes’ “Pom-
posa."

The concert ended with Dr. Gold-
man with the band, with its student
leaders, playing several campus

marches and songs.

Dr. Phelps Advises Students
To Know Life, How To Live

Noted Critic, Band-Director Edwin F. Goldman Draw

Record Attendance At

Wednesday Assembly

By Milton G. Lehman

“I am very proud of the fact that I
have never taught anything useful,"
Dr. W‘illiam Lyon Phelps declared in
an interview, after speaking before
the largest attended University as-

sembly in many years. Dr. Phelps
spoke Wednesday in the Syria Mosque
before an audience of students. fac-
ulty members, and their friends and
t‘a.mi'lies.

The featured speaker was intro-
duced by Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the College, following several num-
bers by the band, led by Dr. Edwin
Fr-anko Goldman, famous leader of the
concerts on the Mall and guest con-
ductor here for the band's home con-
cert \Vednesday night.

Dr. Phelps.‘ speaking on "Contem-
porary Life "and Letters," began by
stating that this was not the ﬁrst
time he has appeared with Dr. Gold-
man, but that this was “his first ap-
-pearance as soloist with the Pitt
band."

“it is necessary to remember the
fashions in letters, just as we do in
goods, slang, and customs. if we are
to understand contemporary liter.-
ture. We wonder why certain forms
appear at certain times," Dr. Phelps
suggested.

Cites “Anthony Adverse" '

“At the time of Shakespeare, the
chief form of poetry was the sonnet.
But I cannot understand why poets
chose to treat the three great subjects,
Vvoman, Nature, and God. in 14 lines."
The speaker smiled. Then be traced
the fluctuation of sonnet writing
through the 18th and 19th centuries.

“Certain forms of writing prevail at
different times," he claimed. "That
is how we explain the fact that for
the last 55 years the chief form of
writing has been the novel. But re
cently we have seen the rise of the
so-called novels that are not really
novels at all: they are books written
to inﬂuence propaganda, science,
,—'thought. "r'eligiou.”

He mentioned Hervey Allen, a grad-
uate of the University ,a.nd implied
that "Anthony Adverse" would well
serve as reading matter for the whole
family. “But Anthony would gain
much if We omitted his last 500
pages,” the critic declared.

Sketches Sinclair Lewis

Then he drew a sharp differentia-
tion between the novel and poetry.
“Novels may be written by a man
late in his life, but even the youngest
of you, if he has not written an im-
mortal piece of poetry or music now,
never will.” The ﬁeldof novel writ-
ing is open to us, the speaker believes.
“There has been no great American
novel written." he stated.

The doctor drew a sketch of his in-
timate friend, Sinclair Lewis, whom
he knew at Yale. “He was a concave
person. universally known as the Red-
whig. He was a defiant individual
and loved literature. In 1920 he came
to me," Dr. Phelps related, “and we
had a long talk together. ‘I have

told me." The novel that Lewis was
writin;.-; was "lllain Street." “It was a
great achievement, a. terrific satire,"
Dr. Phelps declared.

The speaker alluded to the risque

as much detail as possible."

lie concluded, “You can read the
works of literature from two points of
view. .lI‘i:‘st, as :\ story, and, second,
as a mirror of contemporary thought."

After th.-~ lecture, Dr. Phelps‘ assert-
ed that “""‘.-.6-. business of :1 University

some to be overconcerned with prac-

Pitt Threatens Notre Dame
In ‘Jinx-breaker,’ Tomorrow

 

Irish, Panther Track Duel Closes Spring Festival Week;
McGrat.h, Francis, Groat, Connelly Race In Half

 

A gay spring festival crowd will be on hand to see the ﬁnal event
of the Spring Festival week at the Stadium tomorrow afternoon when
a favored Notre Dame track team opens the home season with Coach

Olson's Panther trackmen. The

scheduled for 2 o’clock.

first event, the high hurdles, is

Coach Nicholson's Irish ﬂyers ar¢

rive early in the morning’ with an In-
door CIC title and two outdoor dual
victories in addition to a great deal
of prestige to toss into the Stadium
arena late in the afternoon. Just about
all the Pitt squad can offer are two
Penn Relay champs and an Indoor 50-
meter title-holder.

Notre Dame is rumored to have its
strongest all-around team in history,
boasting no less than above-par per-
formers in all but two events. First
in line comes Don Elser, footballer,
cager, and now a husky weightman.
Elser, strongest in the shot put, placed
second at last Saturday’s Drake re-
lays in his specialty, pushing the ball
past the 46-foot mark. He tosses the
discus better than 130 feet, and should
also make quite a bid for first place
in the low hurdles.

Taano Favored

Levicki in the javelin throw presents
a. problem, Before he was iniuyed last
year hefhad tossed the javelin 210 feet.
Since that time however, he hasn't
been doing so well. throwing around
the .185 mark. Taano of Pitt has been
coming up steadily, copping the Penn
Relay title last Saturday with a throw

f 193 feet, six inches.

The Panthers probably have things
all their way in the high jump. with
Pete Bennett hitting the high spots.
Bennett started out in ﬁne fashon last
year and he seems bent upon contin-
ulng that way, crossing the bars over
the six-foot mark. Oden is another
Pitt six-foot jumper:

John Francis of the Irish will give
the Pitt men plenty to think about in
the mile event, even though Tost IS
furnishing the competition. In the
two—mi1e' Leo McFarland, also Irish,
looks like the winner.

For the first time there will be. an
admission charge at the gate. Tick-

ets sell for 50 cents unless a; student 
which case ~ ':

book is presented, -in"
there will be no charge.

If the P.-mtliers come out on top at
the meet tomorrow, it will be the first
time that they have captured any
sports event from the Irish this year.
Football. tennis. cross-country, swim-
ming, golf, and basketball events have
seen the Golden Cats bowing to the
power of the men from South Bend.
The last time that a Pitt victory was
chalked up was at the indoor CIC
meet February a year ago-. This Yefll‘
the Irish came out on top with Pitt
coming in third.

present the latest developments in
swimming to the gathering of coach-
es, S‘.\'llllIll€l‘S, and officials, splashes
ahead tomorrow afternoon to what
is expected to be the most ambitious
venture of its kind in this part of the
country.

Scheduled to start with the com-

Trees gymnasium, the program has
been divided into two divisions, theory
and demonstrations. No less than 12
reports will be read at the meeting in
the second floor basketball room, pre-
vious to the demonstration period in
the pool. Papers will also be 1'e.-acl at
this meeting, in addition to short
talks by Gordon Mullen, swimming di-
rector of the Em AC, Philadelphia.

Among the demonstrations listed for
the pool later in the afternoon is the
“Use of ‘Torpedo-Buoy’ and novelty

However, this afternoon at 3:30
o’clock, the boys will again attempt
to decide the singles championship
at the University. In case you have
