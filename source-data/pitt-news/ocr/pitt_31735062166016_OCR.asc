  Regulation

Calls For
ID Cards

‘Students Need Pass
To .Wo1'l< Late in SU

(See Editorial Page 4)

The University has insti-
tuted a new series of security
regulations covering students
entering, leaving and working

"~  in 'the’Student _Union during

A the evening hours.

The new system, designed to
protect the property ‘of those or-
-ganizations still retaining offices
in the building, calls for the issu-
ing of special evening passes to
all authorized students whose
work requires them to be in the
SU after 11 p.m. during the week
-and after 1 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday.

Originally, students were merely
required to sign a sheet at .11
p.m. or upon enterting the build-
ing after that hour, stating their
destination, and were. then re-
-quired to signout when leaving.

' Passes Issued _

Last week, however, the spe-
cial building pases were issued’ to
all student organizations in the
SU with the stipulation that no
student would be permitted in any

Jroom nor‘ on any ‘ﬂoor not spe-
ciﬁcally noted on his card.

Each individual card con-
tains the number of only one
room and one ﬂoor .to which
the student will be admitted no
matter the number of rooms-
which the organization to which
he belongs possesses.

-The security department is also
trying to diﬁerentiate between
those students who are using their

_ ofﬁces to study in and those who

'are. engaged in ofﬁcial organiza-
tion business.
_ Two weeks after the new se-
curity regulations went into ef-
fect a camera valued at over $400
was reported missing from the
yearbook ofﬁce on the fourth floor
of the SU.

Eleven Attend
F lyers’ Meet
In Buffalo, N.Y'

Eleven student members of the
University’s Angel [Flight and
Arnold Air Socity, along with Lt.
Colonel William C. ‘Tinsley, pro-
fessor of air science, attended
a joint National Conclave at Buf-
falo, New York, the ﬁrst week in
May. .

According to Tinsley, “This
successful National Conclave, like
the Regional Convention con-

ducted last March in Pittsburgh,
is the end result of students put-
ting into practice the leadership
and managerial training that they
received from their university

-courses.”

"Those who attended from the
University include Bonnie Jean
Beck, Sally Ann Matis, and Mar-
sha Unatin, of Angel Flight, and
the followin-g members of the
Arnold Society: Donald G. Star-
rett, Walter I-layes, Luke J. Gill,
Paul W. Schmid, Robert S. Tate,
Roger K. Meanor, Donald K. Pol-
linger, and Stephen W. Lewis.

chiefly with civil cases, the former
jurist wished,. however, that he
had not been “pressured” so often
“from above.” He found Com-
munist justice in practice both
contradictory and exasperating. ,
Ulc held that the Czechs are not
very nationalistic. “They have
little feeling of national unity due
to the 30 Years War.” Thus they
are not likely to revolt. “The peo-

pleare not brave. Even the Com-
munist hierarchy are security
minded. The Czechs. just “go
along.” He reported that they feel
the “West has the responsibility to
liberate us.”

During the abortive Hunga-H

rian Revolution in 1956 the

‘ common feeling in Czechoslo-

vakia was, he said, that the
Hungarians would become in-
dependent. Then Poland and the
Czechs would follow suit. The
Revolution’s failure cut out any
ﬁght left in the Czechs.

‘The Balcony’  

PETER FALK and Shelley Winters in a scene from “The Balcony."

By ll/{ARTHA LANG

The titles for “The Bal-
cony” go up over what ap-
pear to be newsreel scenes
of riot and civil strife. A
man falls backward and his
head hits the street with a
dull percussive sound like a
watermelon rolling’ off a picnic
table. When‘ his head is lifted
there
blood left on the pavement.
With this. impressively real be-

‘ ginning,_ it takes a" while to ad-

just to the fact ‘that this is an un-
real movie; an allegroy, or per-
haps, a fable.

_ A revolution is in progress in a
hypothetical “tropical” country,
ruled by a queen. It looks like

1 London, but it is to be taken as

Everyland.

Does a man really take unfair advantage of women

when he uses Mennen Skin Bracer?

is a shocking splash of_

In the midst of death and
chaos there is a heaven of peace
—— a brothel, run by Madame
Irma (Shelley Winters). In this
special kind of, country, this is
a special kind of brothel. It looks
like backstage at the Met might
look, with props, backdrops, cos-
tumes and lights all over the
place. There is a lovely white

clapboard house, dappled by’

shade trees, and by George,
there are birds singing. Then
someone steps out from behind
it, and you see that it is just a
stage setting.
Customers, are “Visitors.”

The customers (except th at
they are cal.1ed “visitors,"
please) come here to indulge
their illusions, act out their fan-
tasies. Perhaps they want to pre-
tend they are a baby again for a
few hours, or a king, or Tarzan.
Madame Irma provides the right
setting, attire, sound eﬁects, and

All depends on why he uses it.

Most men simply think Menthol-Iced Skin Bracer is the best
after-shave lotion around. Because it cools rather than bums.
Because it helps heal shaving nicks and scrapes. Because it

helps prevent blemishes.

So who can blame them if Bracer's crisp, long’-lasting aroma

just happens to affect women so remarkably?

- Of course, some men may use Mennen Skin Bracer because

gj this effect.

How intelligent!

' quotable quotes. Shelley Win-

a female companion to narrate‘_

and play straightwoman. It is
organized escape from reality,
withthe overhead kept down as
much as possible.

The script is chuck full of

hers says things like, “Don’t
satisfy the customers too
much: they won’t come back,"
and “The world is full" of good
whores; what it needs is 3
good bookkeeper.” She claims
that her kind of catering-to-
illusion service will always be
around, “sometimes as a
church, sometimes as a ‘the-
atre.”

The ersatz judge says, “The
world is my apple, and with the
knife of the intellect I split it in
two; one half good, one‘ half
bad." There are marvellous pa-
rodies of public speeches, in-
cluding one by Peter Falk, ex-
tolling the virtues of “our great
national nation.”

Vest—Po/cket Notebook Sayings

Most of these little gems are
worked into the plot, naturally.
Occosionally a character stops
and declaims something that
seems to have been taken
straightfrom that little vest-
pocket notebook in which the
author jotted his brainstorms,
with little effort at integrating it
into the play.

The screenplay is by Ben
Maddow, adapted from a play
by Jean Genet. Maddow and
Joseph Strick, the director,
were given a free hand by
Genet in making the film ver-
sion. They have made radical
changes from the original
play‘s form, including the ad-
dition of the Police Chief's big
speech. - '

“The Balcony” is an example
of what is known as the Theatre
of the Absurd; that is, the
authors think man’s life is ab-
surd.

FALL ORLON SWEATER be-
ing modeled for the luncheon
guests.

Four male students from
University publications were
treated to luncheon and free

sweaters, just for casting

their votes for their favorite '

sweaters from more than a
dozen differerit styles shown at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse *1 ast
Wednesday. Now who could kick
about that?

The only drawback seemed to
be that the four young men

Dacro'n®

could take the sweaters back
who wore them. For some rea-'
son, the four were convinced
that the size 44 men’s sweaters
looked better draped over the
bathing-suitecl Miss Universe
contestants who modeled them,

than they did wrapped in a box

and ready to be taken home.
The University’s luncheon visa '
itors to the Playhouse included

Matthew Swetonic, editor of The .
Pitt News; Ralph Albright, "busi-
ness manager of The Pitt News;
Joel Filner, editor of The 1963
Owl and Mr._Pitt, and Richard
Felt, ‘chief photographer for The
Pitt News. ’

This idea to present fashion
shows in restaurants for pre-
dominately male noon-time cus-
tomers originated on the West
Coast. The Pittsburgh Playhouse,
in an attempt to add a little spe-

' cial interest to its menu, brought

the idea East, selecting the new
Fall line of orlon sweaters from
a dozen different‘ manufacturers
for the experiment.

 :0 Security

The new security regulations for the Student Union

_ i’ have gone into effect with the usual result of all such at-
‘ tempts at security in an institution of thissort: nothing is

really secure, and students are being burdened with un-
necessary headaches in the carrying out of their business.
' There are two very good "reasons why the ﬁrst result is

V r .a reality. One is that the SU is easy pickings for all burglars

and sneak thieves during the hours between 7 a.m. when
the building is opened for business and 11 p.m. when it is
closed. The second reason is the one which makes the first
one so important. There are some 25 pass keys to the entire
building circulating among the student body.

_' These ‘pass keys were sold by an enterprising student
to all comers near .the end of last trimester at 25 cents a
' throw. He conducted business in the rumpus room of the

[before information reached The Pitt News that such _trans-

. actions were taking place.

, Since then, Irving N. Rothman, director of student,pub-
lications, has discovered an unauthorizedcstudent using the
mimeographing machine in his private office when he re-
turned from lunch, and a member of The Owl photography

staff has been shocked at the ease with which a friend of
hisnfulﬁlled his claim to be able to open every door in the

‘ .yearbook ofﬁce.

These are only two instances and there are probably

’ many more unreported occurrences in which unauthorized

students have ‘admitted themselves to locked offices in
the SU. ‘

The most interesting’ aspect of this entire situation is
thatin order for additional pass keysto be made, the orig-
inal hadto be obtained for some length of time.
Supposedly, the only pass key available to students is

‘hanging on a hook behind the SU desk in the lobby on the
‘ “ ﬁrst ﬂoor of the building. And this key is only to be used
A by authorized SU Board members and by the police offi-

cers who patrol the building. .
How, then, is our question, did a student manage to

7 have some 25_ pass ‘keys made without the knowledge of

the president of the Board and why-wasn’t something done
to recover the keys after their sale? Also, since the making

"tion been conducted into this flagrant thievery of SU
security?

What this means, essentially, is that the security mea-
sures aren’t going to protect any one’s propertyaslong as

  those 25 keys are still in circulation, and the only way to
V prevent their being used ill.egally is either .to track down all '

the keys, close the Union completely, or "change the locks
on all the doors _i.n the building. .
The first two alternatives are quite impossible and the

‘I .. third would cost the University a sizable amount of’ money,
‘- , but it is the only solution which offers any chance at all

of success. What ever is to be done, however, should be
done soon, as the theft of the $400 camera from The Owl
office last week proves our contention that the new»regurla-
tions have not done very ’much to make things nice and
tight and secure. - A
A Larry Heller, director of the SU, seems to be more

real article. What else could explain the ridiculous riga-
marole that hard working members of student organizations
are being subjected to in the name of security.

The whole affair is being conducted with police state
overtones. Students whose honesty has never been ques-
tioned in the past "are now forced to sign in and out and to
carry passes containing information about their height,
Weight and hair color.

What other purpose could such trivia serve except to
soothe theconscience of Larry Heller into a belief that the
SU is as secure as the First National and that all these new
regulations are serving some useful purpose —— something
which they most deﬁnitely are not.

Parties and

Judges

Cross-ﬁling in any election, primary or other-_
wise, should be made illegal. True, this political
device can’ be used only in judgeship contests,
but it compromises the judgeship itself, and de-
nies the very principle that it is supposed to
affirm. .

The reason that cross-ﬁling
is permitted in racesfor judge
positions is that judgeships are
supposed to be non - political

of ‘the position by’ party, re-

size is ‘an admission that there
is hope of somectype of judicial
favoritism. This, of course, is —'
alien to the American judicial
system. So the system of cross- , ,
ﬁling is devised to transcend party affiliations.
As a device, however, cross-ﬁling is not only
artiﬁcial. It is false and unfair. ‘When a candi-
date cross-ﬁles, he places his name on the bal-
lot sheet of both parties. To the average voter,
the appearance of the candidate’s name on both
party rosters gives the false impression that the
candidate has -been endorsed by both parties.
This impression dispells any other that, through
difficult and persistent work, local precinct per-
sonnel might have fostered before. .
_ It is conceivable, too, that a candidate who
has cross"-ﬁled might win the; nomination under

both party ﬂags.’ In an’ average voters’ turn-out,~

the chances of this happening are considerably
less than in a very poor or very bad turn-out.
Had the ‘turn-out been exceptionally good, for
instance, seasoned observers of Pennsylvania pol-
itics surmised that Anne X. Alpern could very
well have broken party lines and won both nom-

inations in the recent primaries. If thishappens,
of course, the candidate is a shoe-in in the No-
vember election. The voter has no choice to make.

As a device, cross-filing has been used as a
handy tool by the parties, and not as the equali-
zer for which it was intended. Number one, a

cross-ﬁled -candidate is a potential vote-splitter, 4

so that even if he doesn’t receive the nomination,
he may ‘prevent the best of the other candidates
from winning, especially‘ in a tight election. ‘And
number two, it permits a candidate‘ to gauge his
own strength in opposition territory.

:But. what‘ cross-ﬁling? is supposed to accom-

iplish,fit does not. It is not an equalizer. People

still know that Alpern, Hoffman and Mahady
are Democrats,~e'ven though they have cross-ﬁled
and even though it appears that the Republican
party has endorsed a Democrat.

, But what it all boils down to actually. is that L
. thereshould be noneed for .cross_-ﬁling and no

party identiﬁcation when it‘ comes to electing
judges. In fact, unless the number of candidates
becomes, unwieldy, at primary election would not
even have to include the judgeship position. If
there were too many candidates, the top ﬁve or
six could be skimmed,’ off for the November elec-

tion in the primary,” but even then all the judge- -

ship candidates could appear on one list, inde-
pendent and unaligned. -
Cross-ﬁling has only_been extended to the
judgeship contests, but it goes without saying
that any public oﬂicial, be it county commis-
sioner, school director or -justice of the peace, is

supposed to act in an impartial ‘mannerp The

1 party system, when you come right down to it,’
while it has been extolled as a supreme examples

of the democratic tradition, is a lousy; way’ of
picking the best man.

Femina Peclestalis

Philadelphia — The "American ‘male wants to
put his woman on a pedestal, according ‘to the
ad ‘in The New Yorker, and an inquiring article

by "Dr. Edward D. Eddy, Jr., in the Saturday _

Review. , c _

Pearl Buck calls ‘women “angels on. pedes-
tals,” and Dr. Eddy claims”that' '
women “luxuriate in the male’s"—
over-idealization of the female 4‘
creature.” I ,

While the female sometimes ‘
enjoys the view from-the, ped-
estal, ‘Dr. Eddy says she some-
times would like to’ kick the
pedestal .-away a nd achieve
equality with her partner.

According to the headmas-
ter at Chatham College, when A
the girl decides to descend, '
however, her conversation should run something
like this, if I can be granted ,1eeway.

“Oh, hello darling; So nice to see you.”

“Righto, fair princess.” , i ,

“Tell me, darling._ What is that block of stone
I was standing on?”

“That cut of marble,‘ my dear, is called a
pedestal.”

“Oh how cute. A pedestal.”

“Yes, dear. A pedestal.” _ _

“Oh, a pedestal. Honey, what’s a pedestal?”

“Well, it's something no woman should be
caught without.” V

“Oh, I thought it was one of those things that
shouldn’t cross at certain parts of the street.”

“That, dear, is a pedestrian.”

Need we go on. Dr. Eddy suggests that the
American male “relishes this over-idealization
of the female. It makes him feel more masculine
to be surrounded by brainless beautiful women.”
The Man Must Be Duff

How Dr. Eddy can believe this, in light"of the
traﬂic congestion on .the pretzel—like paths of the
Chatham campus every weekend, is beyond com-
prehension.

One of the most. oft-repeated complaints of
today’s educated man, seems to ‘me, to be the
scarcity of girls “with something on their
shoulders.”

Floating in Air

There are too many girls ﬂoating about — in
their own worlds — that have a great big grin
and even a monosyllabic line to go with it.

' This, I believe, is even a critical situation for

the eligible bachelor spawned by today’s stepped-

" up educational processes.

Dr. Eddy’s theory is only one of many that he
expresses in an article entitled “What’s the Use
of "Educating Women?” ’

The author fee1s._there are many .- reasons, but

says people tend to bypass one possibility, and

be intelligent and perceptive housewives, mothers,-
and citizens. '
I can think of no better reason.

I'll alw a‘ y s remember how important my V

mother was'during my early schooldays. She had
gone to a private acadei_n'y' as_ a teenager. Her

-. that is of educating" women who simply want to C .

‘report cards looked like the dialogue of a stut- 

tering guy who couldn’t get started in his con- 

‘ versation.

And the span of subjects always fascinated
me. She had three languages, and geology, as-

trology,‘ and physics," et al. In short, ‘she, was al-

ways a great help. ,

But, when I came‘to college I found my mother
was shrugging her shoulders In 0 r e] than ever
when I posed a question. i ‘

“I always thought I was pretty. smart,” .she_'J

sighed one day. “But I just feel dumb anymore.’ '-

You’re getting too smart for me.”

This sequence will occur more than ever in
the future. Mothers will start thinking they’ve
outgrown their usefulness as soon ‘as jr. starts
taking advanced physics. _

No matter how old you are,‘ it’s always nice
to be able to take yo u r problems to mother.
Whether they're soiled little offspring, or scien-
tiﬁc ones. a '

 Eddy, I want my woman on a pedestal,
but I don’t want her head in the clouds.

Defeat St. Vincent

i” Golfers Score First
Victory in Two Years

It took them two years, but the Panther golf team
ﬁnally won a match. Last Monday (May 21) the linksmen
defeated St. Vincent, 4-2, to end a 21 match losing streak

that began on May 23, 1961.

Strangely enough, the last team to fall to the Panthers
was St. Vincent, which does not speak much for the Bearcat

golfers. That win occurred on May
22, 1961. The next day they lost
to West Virginia to start the long
losing skein.

As though history were repeat-
ing itself, the golfers started on
another losing . streak the day
after their win. This time it was
Penn State, rather than West Vir-
ginia, who nipped the “winning
streak” at one victory.

1-10-2 Record

The Lions whipped the Panthers,
6-1, to give the team a 1-10-2 re-
cord for the season.

Heroes of the‘ win over St.
Vincent were Phil Abaray, Phil
Fassett, Bob McSorley and Joe
Hughes. Each scored a point for
the team. '

Abaray, the team's, number
-two player, defeated Pa-ul Ben-
ko, 6 and 5. Fa-ssett won over
Mike Johnson, 3 and 2, McSo_r-
ley won a close match over
Austin Noli, one up and Hughes
easily beat Robert Slavonia, S
and 4. y .

Only Neil Shorthouse and Clair
Riley were losers for the P_anthers.
Shorthouse, playingin the number
one spot, lost to Rich Shirey, two
up, and Riley was defeated by
"Jerry Slavonia, 3 and 2.

Abaray was the only Panther
who could score a point against
Penn State. He defeated Dave
Miller, 2 and. 1. The match was
closer than the ﬁnal score indi-
cates since Shorthouse and Riley
izgst one up. _ ' ’ .
”Tb,.~.«, Penn State was the ﬁnal
natch of the ‘year for the golfers.

Result: The experimental Ford Mustang,
lively 2-seater loadedwith ‘

significant engineering features

Just under13 feet long—weight. 1544 pounds, 400 to 700 pounds

less than comparable models of popular imported sports jobs—-
the Mustang is representative of the interesting design chal-
lenges at Ford Motor Company. Unique ways of reducing weight

without sacriﬁcing strength, to improve performance and
economy, may stem from its design. '

For example, seats are an integral part of the Mustang's body,"
adding structural rigidity. Brake, clutch and accelerator are
mounted on a movable cluster which can be adjusted fore and
aft (as can the steering wheel) to suit varying sizes of drivers.

Other important features: low-drag. aerodynamic shape proven
in the wind tunnel; independent frontand rear suspension; disc
front brakes; roll bar built as an integral part of the body/frame
structure; hot V-4 engine mounted forward of the rear axle in
unit with a—4-speed manual transmission. ‘
