UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

At ﬁrst, getting snubbed for a trip to
Ireland didn’t look that bad to Jon Peters.

Though Peters, a drummer in the Pitt
band for three years, hadn't been selected
to go to the Pitt-Rutgers game in Dublin,
he ﬁgured that the Panthers would get to
go to a bowl game and he would be
rewarded for the countless hours he’d
spent working with the band for no pay.

“I figured those of us who didn't go to
Ireland would surely go [somewhere]. But
the chances of going to a bowl game are
looking pretty grim, too, the more I think
about litl." Peters said.

According to the contract Pitt and Rutgers
made with the Brian Boru Co., sponsor of
the Emerald Isle Classic, the bills for only
67 of the 213 band members and Golden
Girls will be paid. And since Pitt athletic
department officials refused to allow the
band to raise its own funds for the trip,

while Rutgers will be sending its entire

band, only a small part of the Pitt group
will go.

W. Dean Billick, associate director of
athletics, said that the band is so involved
in two other fund-raisers that a tahird one
is not feasible. '

“They didn’twant to put money into us,”
Jeff Arnold, a bass drummer with three
years experience in the band, said. “Rutgers
will have their whole band there, and it’s
going to make Pitt look bad. I think it will
hurt the organization and turn people off. ”

The band has practiced four nights‘ a

‘ week, and has held game-day morning

v

 

practices. Even students who were selected
feel that the deal is unfair.

“I'm upset because I don’t think it’s fair
to those who put a lot of effort into the
band,” said Paula Knezevich, a junior and
member of the color guard. “It’s a group

effort and should continue to be one.

“I wasn't too sure that the proposal
would have worked, but [the athletic
department] should have given us the
chance. I think it’s a shame that they
couldn’t do more or give us more room to
help ourselves. An opportunity like this
comes along once in a lifetime. It seems
like more could have been done.”

Melissa Herb, a senior piccolo player
who is also going on the trip, agreed. “For
me it was a disappointment. I know it’s a
cliche, but everyone deserved to go. We
were hoping to get fundsfor the trip, but
it didn’t work out that way.”

The band did attend two away games
this year, West Virginia and Notre Dame,
which is the usual number of trips for the
band. One of the proposals to raise funds
for Ireland was to cancel the band’s
engagement in Notre Dame; however, the
athletic department balked.

“[Notre Dame] is no big deal compared
to Ireland,” according to Paula Meisner,
who will not be going to Ireland after four
years as a Golden Girl. “I think they should
have given us a chance. I'm sure everyone
could have raised the money. I mean, who
doesn’t want to go to Ireland?"

v 0 o 1 It

Band Director O’Neill Sanford doesn’t
like to talk about Ireland.

“It disturbs the hell out of me," Sanford
said. “I get calls daily asking, ‘Why didn’t
you fund raise?’ The carpet in my office is
still wet. Students actually cried over this.”

Sanford admitted that he has had morale
problems, although no one has quit over
the Ireland game. ,

Sanford said he is not angry with the
athletic department because they have
been “very supportive” on other fund-
raisersfor new uniforms and endowed

scholarships over the past three years.
However, he said he “did everything in
his power to convince the administration"
to find a way to send the entire band. He

said he understands the administration's"

point of view but wishes they would
understand his.

“You try to be positive, but I’m human,
and I have self-pride. The administration
can’t look at this the way I do,because I’m
the director of bands. Maybe I'm
prejudiced, but I know what it takes to
make the program work.”

According to Sanford, he first heard
rumors about the trip last spring and was
immediately enthusiastic since there had
never, in the band’s 78-year history, been
an event on the international level. He felt
that the band would serve as “goodwill
ambassadors” in a cultural exchange,
which would bring an enormous amount
of attention to the band in the process.
However, he soon learned that the Brian
Boru Co. would only pay for 61 band
members. Though the number would
laterbe increased to 67, the disappointment
was still there.

According to Sanford, he had learned
about the trip in “April or May” and then
“looked at some options” for fund-raising,
like “raffle tickets, whatever it takes to
generate lfundsl." He was also in contact

with John Madden, who was then director
of Rutgers’ marching band, and found out
that Madden was planning a raffle to raise
funds to take his band. _

However, Sanford said that when he
approached the athletic department, he
was told that because it was right before
the summer, “the administration said it
wouldn't be feasible.”

He said, “I agree to a degree. The big
problem was the lateness. It would have
been possible if we got going before
students went home for summer. I would

imagine that [Rutgers] got off to a quicker
start."

However, Billick said that it was a
matter of priorities, not time, that caused
the athletic department to deny Sanford’s
proposal for fund-raising.

“We are traveling as if it were any away
football game,” Billick said. “This is not
being treated as a bowl game because it’s
not like a bowl game where you have a
million dollars.”

Billick said that the department decided
not to have a fund-raiser because of two
other fund-raisers it has had over the past
three years, including an ongoing one to
buy new equipment and instruments, and
a new fund-raiser to give scholarships to
band members. “You’ve got to have
priorities," he said. “For us, [the other
fund-raisers] were a higher priority. For
Rutgers, the trip was.”'

Sanford acknowledged that the
administration has given the band support
for the other projects but feels that these
are all important if the band is to continue
to develop as a public relations tool and
recruitment incentive.

“We owe it‘ to the students,” Sanford
said. “We should give them a quality
instrument for the work they put in. And
how can I successfully recruitifl have a
strident that comes from a high school
with a better program than we have?”

According to Jim O'Brien, president of
the Brian Boru Co. and founder of the
Emerald Isle Classic, he first met with
Director of Athletics Edward‘ E. Bozik in

’ December of 1988 and began to talk

about the deal. Billick confirmed that the
athletic department was approached by
the Brian Boru Co. before the first game
was played last December.‘

Phil Cahalin, vice president of Brian
Boru, said that the number of band

Band deserves Ireland trip

The athletic department obviously hasn’t learned

. anything in the past two years.

In 1987, when Pittwas getting ready to send the

V Panthers to the Bluebonnet Bowl, the athletic depart-

ment decided that they couldn’.t afford to send the band.
After petitions were presented showing support for the
band being included in the trip, the department recon-
sidered. ’
Now, however, a similar situation has arisen. When Pitt
plays Rutgers in Dublin, Ireland, on Dec. 2, only 67 band

members, including a few Golden Girls, will be there. .

Granted, it wasn’t the decision of the athletic depart-
ment. The final number of traveling band members was
part of the contract that both Pitt and Rutgers signed with
the Brian Boru Co., the sponsor of the Emerald Isle
Classic. - S . '

However, on Dec. 2, the entire Rutgers band will be in
Ireland. The members of that band had a fund-raiser, and
according to Jon Korzun, director of Rutgers marching
band, all but 10 of the over 200 members will be there.
Those 10 had other commitments. ,

Pitt’s athletic department officials weren’t nearly as
helpful. They denied requests for fund’-raising because
of the cost, the lack of time and whatever answer they
were giving that day. According to W. Dean Billick,

associate director of athletics, it would cost $800 to $900 ’

to send each band member to Ireland. Rutgers, by
putting its_band in youth hostels, and taking other cost-
cutting measures, will be sending the band for approxi-

' .7 mately. $400 a person.
When told this, Billick denied that it was possible. The '
' proof of possibility willbe seen by anyone who watches

the Pitt-Rutgers game, when a full Rutgersband per-
forms. '

V The band works as hard as any other student organi-
zation, for no pay. They are as much a part of the football
games as the football players and shouldbe a source of
' pride for the university. They should be able to boost

' morale, and we wonder how effective they will be with .

only 67 people. _ .
S Pitt should be proud to have people who are dedicated
enough to work several hours a week so that there can
i be a band. Pitt is fortunate to have a director of bands like
O’Neill Sanford, who has been able to turn the band
around. In the Midwest, college bands are often cheered

A as ‘much as the football teams. During halftime at Pitt

- stadium, fans use the time to go to the restrooms.
' ‘Obviously, from statements made by Billick, the ath-
letic department either didn’t care enough to really look
. into“ the costs of sending the band to Ireland, or it is totally
inept. These officials are denying the band an opportu-
nity of a lifetime because, as Billick said, they have
.. already put money into new instruments and scholar-

I it I‘ ships.  «

While this support is good, it shouldn’t be seen as a

  bonus because‘ these things are essential to a good band

program. The Ireland trip is something extra, but consid-
ering the work that people have put into the program, the

’ entire Pitt band has earned. the right to go to Ireland. i_

Animal experiments can be cruel

Before anyone decides that
animals do not need protection
from use in medical research, the
following points ought to be
considered:

1. Little if any attention is given
to the physical or mental comfort
of laboratory animals. Many of
the hundreds of lab animals that
I have seen at Pitt are confined to
very clean, small stainless steel

A cages. Laboratory animals are

often placed in restraining de-
vices for months at a time. I have
seen many lab animals, espe-
cially monkeys, display behavior
indicative of extreme frustration
and discomfort. Despite the
thoughtfulness of some lab per-
sonnel who give their worn-out

» shoes to the caged dogs to chew

on, there exists room for im-
provement in the living condi-
tions imposed upon these ani-
mals. “ r J

2. Must animals be used as
much as they are? I know of at
least one group of physicians
that says no. There exists apathy
and inertia on the part of re-
search planners to avoid cruelty.
While opinions vary on the issue,
facts do not. Perhaps greater
review should ' be placed upon
the decision to use animals or
alternative methods.

3. The tacit assumption that all
medical research is “good” and/

or “necessary” is incorrect. At this .

point in time, biomedical tech-
nology has developed to a state

that can sustain longevity and
. health for almost all of our popu-

lation, so much so that Ameri-
cans can eat bad food, smoke,
avoid exercise and still live past
70. Those who justify promotion
of human life at any cost seek to
drive the ‘world's population to
its limit. Such a limit will result
from the inability of the earth to
support the mere survival of more
humans, a very unpleasant situ-
ation. '

Nice people don’t torture nice
animals for fun, proﬁt or" educa-
tion, even though we can get
away with it.

I Expulsion of students a bad

idea

I felt it V was my duty as a
responsible human, being to re-
spond to Jim McWhinney’s ar-
ticle that appeared in the Oct. 24,
1989 Pitt News. The article dealt
with the new policy the Pitts-
burgh Public School system has
begun [...]. The program calls for
the expulsion of students that are
found possessing weapons or
drugs in the schools. Jim agreed
with this idiotic program.

Think about what is happen-
ing here. The Pittsburgh Public
Schools are going to deal with
the increasing drug problem by
taking it out .of the schools and
into the streets (out of sight, out
of mind). Jim thinks that is a good

 

_idea because we get “the dregs of

society  forced out of the class-
room and onto the streets.” This
is of course where the police and
eventually judges, assuming that
these “degenerates” are caught,
“can hand down the maximum
sentence allowed” under the law.

This, my friend Jim, has to be
one of the most “naive assump-
tions” that I have ever heard. You
are going to take young kids that
are misdirected in ' life and ex-
clude them from the only institu-
tion that can provide some direc-
tion. This is assuming that their
parents don’t care enough to stop
the problem. I don’t want to hear
that they don’t ‘know about it

either. If a parent is that stupid»

that they do not wonder why
their kid is so apathetic all of the
time —,assuming they are on
drugs — or ‘where all of the

. money for the new Mercedes,
. that they have bought with money
, from drug sales, comes from when

they know that their child has no
job. Without any type of educa-
tion, you cannot get a job worth
mentioning. McDonald's is not a
job; sorry ifl offend anyone, but

 , - « think about‘ it,__‘do you wantto
l_ I 5 Dave. Cooper

spend the restﬁof your life mp-

ping burgers? At the very least,
you need a high school diploma
to ﬂaunt around, and if kids are
kicked out of school, then they
can’t get one. I think that there is
a conﬂict of interest here. If you
do not see it, let me point it out
to you: If you expel a kid for

— selling drugs, then you are forc-

ing that kid to further sell drugs
because now he has no hope of
ever making anything of his/her
life. I

Another point. Let’s sayJohnny
was caught in school, kicked‘ out
and then caught by the police.
Do you really‘ think a judge is
going to hand down the “maxi-
mum sentence allowed by law?”
Think about the last time some-
one was. Most cases that are
scheduled to go to court-never
end up there. There is something
called plea bargaining where the

There is a good chance that 90
percent of the people that will be
affected by the “law? do not want

the point. The point is that they

I don’t know what the solution

Favorite columnist defects to the Free University

After much internal angst and
uncertainty, I have decided that
this will be my last column for
The Pitt News.

I’ve decided that enough is
enough. I just couldn’t bear
writing for this fascist organiza-
tion, even if half the staff is to
the left of Teddy Kennedy. At
first I thought that The Pitt News
was just your regular, liberal,
student university newspaper.
That was until the November
issue of the Free UniversityPress
came out. F

After perusing last week’s
edition of the FUP, I felt like the
character Jorgis in Upton

I Sinclair’s The jungle going to his
first socialist assembly and
hearing the new gospel. “My

God,” I thought. “My God! This
is it!” Although I have yet to
Contact the editor of the FUPfor

_/a job, I have packed my bags,

collected my last paycheck and
kissed my perspective editor
good—bye.

Since the Free UniversityPress
is relatively new to Pitt, it is still
shrouded in mystery. There is

no mention in the paper who, if
anyone, is editor in chief..T here
is no indication as to how often
the paper is published, and most
importantly, what kind of salary
I can expect once I join their
staff.

What there is in the FUP is
back-slapping —- and a lot of it.
My favorite section is the “Letters
to the Editor.” In the last issue,
two loving readers wrote that the
FUP, “was the best damn thing in
print to germinate at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in memory.”
The irate ideologues go on to say
that The Pitt News “continues to
bottom out with innocuous col-
umns of Pollyanna stories and
yellow journalism. ” My! “Innocu-
ous” and “Pollyanna” — and in
the same sentence, too. Although
this couple could not have di-
rected their harsh vocabulary

_toward me, for my columns are

anything but optimistic, I still

_ take great offense at this on-

slaught ofwords directed toward

my journalistic compatriots.
The second letter was written

by the Student Action Union. At

least two of these members are
staff writers of the Free Univer-
sity Press. That’s another reason
why I wish to defect to the FUP;
objectivity has no place in a
newspaper. S
Also appealing about the FUP
is that it has the personality of a
Johnny One Note. The key word

 

in this pamphlet is dissent. Per-
haps the paper should be re-
named the University Free Pm-
tester. In this tabloid were news/

propaganda pieces on pro-'

choice rallies, the student march
with the homeless, organizations
for the homeless , and protest
groups against racism, sexism,
the death penalty, the right wing,
the capital—gains tax cut —— and
even protests against the lack of
protests. Obviously that person

The prophet Otis speaks on incest

A reading from the book of

Otis 9;4-11.

“And a time fell on the City of
Pittsburgh when the people cried

outsaying: ‘We are forlorn, the
Lord God despises us, for He has
taken our parking and left our
cars in the street.’ And the Lord
spoke to them through the
prophet Otis, and said, ‘Let there
be concrete on your yards and
your lawns, and there shall you
park your cars. L

“Having resolved this crisis, the
prophet Otis was weary, and he
wished to rest. But the Council
called a meeting, in which they
made designs to send a foul letter
to the president, chastising him
for vetoing a law that would have
made alms available for poor
women, victims of rape and in-
cest, to have abortions.

“And seeing this, the Lord God
spoke again through Otis, say-
ing, ‘Have you not read the scrip-
tures? Incest is not a whole sin,
for did not my servant Lot and my
servant Abraham partake of the
taste of that fruit?’

“But the Council refused to
heed the word of the Lord and
rashly sent the letter anyway, and
a darkness fell over the land ..._”

The City Council of Pittsburgh
voted last week to send a letter to
George Bush, condemning his
veto of a bill which would have
funded abortions for poor women
in cases of rape or incest.

Otis Lyons, the most enthusias-
tically incoherent council mem-
ber, voted against the letter be-
cause “Incest has not been found
to be a whole sin because some
of the great leaders in the Bible
married their sisters as Abraham

has done.” I take it that if it is not

a whole sin, it must not be a big

- deal. The 25 protestors whogath-

ered outside the City—County
building for 50 minutes last week
also interpreted his remark as a
dismissal of the seriousness ‘of
incest. ;

Later, Lyons explained, “I do
not promote, subscribe to or
condone incest. It’s totally wrong.”

No doubt his previous state-
ment was just a slip (perhaps a
Freudian slip, but a slip, never-
theless). ~

 

 

While politics in this great city
constantly borders on the ab-
surd, Lyons’ logic is profoundly
stupid.

His biblical reasoning can also
lead one to the conclusion that
having sex with a married woman
and then arranging her husband's
death is not a big deal, not a
“whole sin." (King David com-
mitted that one, with the wife of
Uriah, for all you Bible trivia nuts,
and I know you’re out there ...)

Otis Lyons is a dangerous man
if he is willing to let his literal

interpretations of a very ambigu-

ous book inﬂuence his official
decisions in an elected post.

The Bible has been used be-
fore as ’a basis for law. It has been
used todefencl slavery, religious
persecution, genocide and sex-
ual discrimination. This does not
recommend it to future genera-
tions as a guide for political ide-
ology.

And frankly, the idea that in-
cest is OK, that it is not a “whole

r

sin," is asinine. It is emotionally
damaging for _its victims; it is
genetically damaging for the
children conceived through it.
The issue here is, of course, not
really incest at all, but abortion.
The Council made a noble, albeit
useless, gesture by expressing its
opinion on‘ the abortion-funding
veto. They showed that they have
the courage to make a stand on a
controversial issue that directly
affects women right here in Al-

legheny County.

Lyons also went on the record
last week on the subject of Ben
Woods, former acting City Coun-
cil president. The Pittsburgh Press
reported his statement on Woods’

. conviction on 17 counts of extor-
tion, racketeering, conspiracy and -

tax evasion. Lyons said, “I feel
that’s the way a lot of our busi-
ness is done. Quid pro quo. You
do this for me, and I’ll do that for
you.

“It’s sad to see a good man go.
In my opinion, what [Woods] did
is part of oursystem.” _

Racketeering and extortion part
of our system? Where in the Bill
of Rights was that mentioned?

Well, we are only stuck with '

Otis until January, when his illus-
trious term comes to a close. But

a as I walked past the election

booths last Tuesday,’failing for
the fifth straight year to vote, I
had to wonder.

Could I be allowing an idiot I

like Otis Lyons to get into a
political office where he obvi-

ously does not belong by refus-

ing to vote? I

I'm going down to register next a

week.

doesn’t read the rest of the FUP.
On the last page is a list of yet
more protest groups in case the
aforementioned ones are found
unappealing.

But please, do not mistake my
tone as being condescending
toward these children of the ’60s
who were born in the ’70s. I find
some of it actually useful. For
instance, on page two was a
student dissection hotline to call

or alternatives” to lab dissection.

922-FROG. Remember, “no one
can force you to dissect an ani-
mal” even if human abortion is
OK.

Perhaps the best part of the
Free University Press is its self-
styled “Poetry Corner.” The
unwritten law, it appears, is that
anyone’s poetry —— no matter
how wretched —- will be pub-
lished. If only The Pitt News was
that open-minded. I have sub-

’ mitted to my editor an epic poem

on Ronald Reagan and a collec-
tion of lyrical ballads dedicated
to Pitt's “Golden Girls.” I’m still

waiting for an answer. Maybe
the Free University Press will give
my poetry a shot.

I know what you’re thinking,
dear reader. How can a fascist,
cynical, unclean person such as
myself hope to belong to an
organization as immaculate and

__open as the Free UniversityPress? .

Believe me,’ I’ve changed my
radical right-wing ways. I can-

celed my subscriptions to the .
American Spectatorand the New

Criterion, I burned my Adam
Smith book, I’ve renounced
Machiavelli, I’m listening to Pe-

ter, Paul and Mary and have"

become a Druid. But most of all,
I’ve formed a coalition against

coalitions that don’t like other ‘

coalitions.

So, without further adieu, I end
my last column with mixed
emotions. And if you should see
me on the street, ‘protesting the
5th Avenue bus lane and fail to
say, “Hi,” I’ll understand.

Mario Oliverio was a colum-
ntLstforThe Pitt News.

There will be no chemical
weapons on the face of the
earth by the year 2000.

This was the main theme of
President Bush’s speech to the
United Nations General As-
sembly on Monday, Sept. 25,
1989. This is a very important
and significant proposal for
, President Bush; however, this

. event was not covered to an
overwhelming» degree by the

Bush wor/es towozm’
nuclear-free world

addition to the present INF
Treaty, over the next two years.
Only seven years ago, Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan was pro-
posing plans to increase the
U.S. chemical weapons sup-
ply, as well as the Strategic
Defense Initiative or Star Wars.
Now President Bush is talking
about a world free from chemi-
cal weapons. We may well be
on our way to a world with no .

 

in America and in the world.
“We must get rid of this
scourge on the Earth,” Bush
said of chemical weapons. He
proposed a 10-year plan to
‘ completely rid the world of
chemical weapons — a dream
come. true for peace activists
and human beings alike.
Bush’s plan can have great ef-
fects on the world, and its final
outcome would truly change
the world forever.
His plan was directed at the
Soviet Union, and in addition
‘to other authorities, Bush
himself said in-his speech, “I
think that they will agree to it. ”
In accordance with this plan,
over the course of eight years,
the United States and the Soviet
Union would decrease. their
stockpiles of chemical weap-
ons to an equal amount in
tons that will be 80 percent of
the U.S. supply. In addition,
the United States and the Soviet
Union would proceed with
new arms agreements, in

media. Cer- nUC1€3T

tained in lalnll’ T10
Bush’s plan 003 CV3’
couldhavea r e a l 1 Y
vast impact lhmlghl
on every , that any of
person both this was _

-possible. The INF Treaty was
a somewhat unforeseen and
immeasurably great step in
the right direction. A world
free of chemical weapons is
something that we generally
think can never happen.

Invariably, one will hear that
the world will end due to

World War III, the war of the
nuclear bombs and buttons. If
this proposal amounts to
anything, the Earth will have
to be destroyed by some other
means.

Remember when the great— _ ‘l V

two countries was conven-

Bush’s could drastically change
everyone’s life; so if you favor
a world free of chemical‘
weapons, which almost eve-

support Bush and believe in
the possibilities of his plan.

team so their band gets to go."

Jon Korzun, director of Rutgers’
marching band, denied that this
was true.

According to John Madden,
who set up the fund-raiser before
leaving the Rutgers band program
to go to Michigan State last
summer, they ﬁgured out how
much it cost to send the band,
which he said he did not
remember, but it “was close to

$100,000. We then divided that
number by the band and arrived
at a number of $400 per band

1 — 15 Words $2.50
16 - 30 words $3.00

Part of this figure came from
the fact that Rutgers took the sum
given by Brian Boru to send 67
band members and “spread the
money out over the whole band,”
according to Korzun.

Madden set up the fund—raiser
after getting a local car dealership
to donate a car. The band
members sold rafﬂe tickets, with
the car as the prize. Korzun said
that the tickets cost $10 and that
the fund-raiser is still on even
though the dealership changed
its mind about the car. The winner
now only gets one year's free
lease.

Madden said that he set up the
fund-raiser because “band kids
have a different kind of
enthusiasm when there is a big
project to rally together [for].
Fund-raising is not that tough,
especially when you’ve got about
200 people who are enthusiastic.”

Korzun also said that “some
students aren’t selling tickets.
They are putting up their own
money.’ I personally don’t like
any band member putting out his
own money, [but] some students
have no qualms about it.

“Others are selling the tickets.
They've got their parents selling
them at work; [they're] selling
them to their extended family.
We've got band alumni donating
by buying tickets. They figure it’s
going to be a worthy cause."

Billick noted that the
department did review Sanford’s
proposal but did not feel it was
realistic because the band
members would have to raise
between $125,000 and $150,000
for an additional 160 people,
under the assumption that ‘it
would cost $800 to $900 per band
member.

However, when told that the

Rutgers band would be going for L

$400 per person, Billick said he
didn't believe it.

“They can't go for that. T hat’s
$64,000 for the band. We couldn’t
take a band over for that. The
figure is closer to $800 to $900
per person,” he said.

Billick also said that the fact
that the Rutgers band will be
staying in youth hostels to save
money while in Ireland was
irrelevant because the places that
the Pitt band members will be
staying “are not big luxury hotels."
He said that he felt that Rutgers
must be helping out the band
members.

However, Korzun said that
$80,000 was the figure he came
up with including the money
from the Brian Boru Co.

“It'can’t be $900 per person,"
Korzun said. “That’s what the
average person off of the street
pays for a package.” He added
that a collective package would
reduce the rates signiﬁcantly.

However, Billick maintained
that the athletic department made
the best decision. “It's not as if
we’re trying to deprive [the band].
It's just that any effort to go to
Ireland is above what we’re
budgeted."

Billick also said that the Ireland
game would be a “bonus” for

r,''\ .
.,

some of the students because if it _

had been played in Rutgers as
originally scheduled, it “would
be an away game and no one
would go” since the band has
already been on two away trips.
He also said that dropping the
trips for Ireland would not make
enough of a financial difference
to allow the entire band to go to
Ireland.

Dowling shines at IC4A

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Keith Dowling became the firstmale cross-country runner
from Pitt in 10 years to qualify for the NCAA Championship
meet, which will be held Nov. 20.

Dowling, a junior, qualiﬁed for the NCAAs by placing ninth
at the IC4A cross—country meet last weekend. He covered the
10,000-meter course in 29:44. The IC4A meet was subdivided
into regions, and Dowling ﬁnished fifth among competitors in
Pitt's region.

“It was pretty much a goal of mine to make it,” said Dowling.
“I was surprised at how good I felt throughout the race. I
expected to place somewhere around 15-20, but it was one of
those days you hope for. It was the best race of my life.”

As a team, Pitt ﬁnished ﬁfth out of 19 teams in its region and
ninth out of 31 overall. Georgetown, Navy, Penn State and
Bucknell ﬁnished ahead of Pitt in the region.

“We ran really well. We were hoping to place in the top
three, but everyone would have had to run the best race of the
year, and that doesn’t happen tooyoften in one meet,” said Pitt
head coach Jim Lear. ,

Pitt sophomore Scott Humphrey finished 23rd overall in the
meet with a time of 30:03. Paul Friedrich was the third Panther
across the line with a time of 31: 10, good for 69th place overall.
Jason Bodnar was four seconds behind Friedrich and ﬁnished
73rd. Eric Downer, who ran the course in 31:30, rounded out
the scoring with a 104th—place ﬁnish.

Lear was happy about the performance of the Panthers -
considering they had a sub-par Big East meet in late October. ~

Pitt placed fifth in that meet, also.
“After Big East, this was a real good race,” said Lear. “It was

‘ nice to beat Connecticut and Boston College in the IC4A meet,

considering they beat usat Big East."

Dowlin g credited his, training technique for his improvement
from Big East to IC4A. “I was gearing up for IC4A. I wasn’t fresh
for,.Big East because I was still feeling the effects of September
training. The only thing that really changed was that I was

rested more.”

unspectacular 6-4-1 record, also

seem destined for a better bowl .

than Pitt, Arkansas, Virginia,

Lions are pretty much locked
into the $1 million Holiday Bowl

However, they could play on

Lady swimmers win big over Clarion

Byscott Campbell
Staff Writer
The Pitt Lady Panther

swimming team defeated the
Clarion Golden Eagles Friday
night, 174-115, at Trees Pool.
Don’t be fooled by the score
though; it wasn't that close. The
Lady Panthers swam three events
as exhibition, which means that

Clarion received all the points in

the events, even though Pitt won
all three.

Clarion is a Division II team,
albeit a very good Division II
team, having won several national
championships at that level. The
Lady Panthers, however, are
ranked 30th in the country in
Division I by the College
Swimming Coaches Association
and simply had too much talent
for the Golden Eagles.

1 “We like coming up here to
swim [against] Pitt. It gives our
people a chance to swim against
some great athletes in a great
facility,” said Clarion Assistant
Coach Mark VanDyke. _

The Lady Panthers had three

yards and four touchdowns.

The four TDs bring Thompson's
career total to 64, also an NCAA
record. The previous record for
rushing yards‘ in a game was
357, shared by Mike Pringle of
Fullerton State, who set the

record last week, and Rueben
Mayes of Washington State in
1984.

-More records at Houston —
wide receiver Manny Hazard
caught two Andre Ware TD
passes to set an NCAA record

- of 19 TD "receptions in a season.

Ware, who completed 27 of 49
passes for 411 yards, set
Southwest Conference records
for completions in a season
(292) and career yards (7,327).
Incidentally, Hazard leads the
nation with 1 18 catches, just 16.
off the NCAA record set by
Tulsa's Howard T willey in 1965.

Sullivan captured the 100-
meter breaststroke in 1:06.94 and
the 200 breast in 2:26.20. Sheis
the defending Big East champion
in both events.

McShane took both middle-
distance freestyles, winning the
200 in 1:54.70 and the 500 free in
5:10.62. Comeau took the 1,650
freestyle in 17:31.16 and the 200

“That’s a surprise. That’s the

Clarion did manage to sneak

win, and we were winning with
five meters to go. We feel like the
close races should be ours, and
that’s something we really work
on.”

Other Lady Panther victories
were achieved by Kristina Thames
in the 100 backstroke (1:00.27),
Krissa Ratliff in the 1-meter diving
(244.15 points), Janine Atiyeh in
the 200 back (2:17.11), Nicole
Bunker in the 3—meter diving

A (247.13) and the team of Thames,

Sullivan, Noelle Barry and
Christine Gallagher in the 200
medley relay (151.89).

This weekend, Pitt travels to
Charlottesville, Va., to battle the
14th-ranked Virginia Cavaliers.

“It’ll be a good test. We're
certainly not going to walk in
there thinking that we can-’t do
anything against them, but we
have our work cut out for us,”
said Belowich. “They may be

_ more talented; so we're simply

going to have to outﬁght them.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, November 14, 1989

Continued from page 6
According to Sanford, choosing

' ' the 67 students to go was one of

the most difficult tasks he has
faced since coming to Pitt five
years ago. He said that his original
attitude was that if everyone
could'1’t go, he didn’t want to
take anyone, but he was bound
by the contract signed by the
athletic department to take them.

Sanford said that he tried to

A" pick the students on a variety of
._ attributes,

including seniority,
merit, attitude and playing ability,
as well as trying to equally
represent all of the sections. This,
he added, was impossible to do
entirely fairly. A

“I think that we did the best we
could do in this situation,” he
said. “Were we 100 percent

, accurate in the way we selected

the students? No. The only way
we could be was if we were
flying out of here with a jet
carrying 213 people.

“This wasn’t a thing that we got
together and discussed for two or
three hours. I’d say we spent a
good 20 hours, two to three at a‘
time, going over the list trying to
decide. [We worked] up until one
hour before we had to turn in the
list to the Golden Panther office.
I “It was very intense and not a

"- A pleasant thing. We recruited an

outstanding freshman class, and

the ﬁrst ones you eliminate are
the freshmen. We pulled names
from a hat in two different
sections. That actually happened.”

Sanford said that the band “had
nothing” when he came to Pitt
four and a half seasons ago, and
he is happy with the progress the
band has made. However, he
admitted that he is also worried
that the progress will not be
evident in Ireland, especially since
Rutgers will have its entire band
there. Both bands will be
participating in a parade.

“We can’t do a halftime show
with 67 people. We were asked
to play the parade, and we can

. do that, but the students who go

to Ireland are going to be
intimidated when they see a 206-
member band at halftime.”

He said he is also concerned
about the impressions of others.
“Leave it to your imagination what
the impression will be. If you
were a fan, and you saw Rutgers
with 206 people, and then you
saw us, a lot of questions would

go through your mind, like ‘Is

that the full Pitt band?’

“Remember,
televised. High school students,
alumni, Penn State fans [will all
see this]. I would imagine their
impression wouldbe ‘That's pretty
shabby.’ Will
recruiting? I don’t know; I sweat

this will be .

this_ hurt my,

about that."

Sanford said that this trip would '
be the perfect opportunity to,’

make Pitt band a “total band
program” on the scale of other
universities whose bands travel
internationally every year. The
trip could also have been a boon
for recruiting high school students
to the Pitt band program.

According to Sanford, the Pitt

band is the largest public relations
tool the university has, since it
plays at sporting events, pep
rallies and special events for Pitt
President Wesley Posvar, and the
members are willing to perform
at almost any time. Thoughvthey
returned from Notre Dame at 6
a_.m. on Sunday Oct. 30, the band
members were ready to perform
for a Chautauqua at Pitt event at
3 p.m. that afternoon.

Sanford said that though the
decision has been made about
Ireland, he is sure that the band
will continue to grow, and “next
year will be the band's year.

“My personal pride is hurt.

We’ve got a better band than , ‘

Rutgers, and after ﬁve seasons of
getting the band where it is, I
hope this doesn’t damage our
reputation.
