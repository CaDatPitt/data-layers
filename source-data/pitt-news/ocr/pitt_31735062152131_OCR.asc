Murray Declares Industry
Must Concede Workers’
Right To Organize

 

By William Stark

“The future security of this coun-
try depends on big business conced-
ing to workers those privileges that
have been grant-ed to them by law;
namely, the right to o-rganize into
in-dep-endent labor organizations, and
the right of labor to bargain collec-
tively.”

This problem, in the words of
Philip R. Murray, chairman of the
Steel W-orkers Organizing Committee,
is one of the most vital in our his-
tory.

Speaking before an audience of
more than 125 people at Inquiry
Forum on Mon-day, Mr. Murray re-
lated the history of the struggle of
craft versus industrial unionists in
the American Federation of Lab-or,
and the conditions which led to the
temporary suspension of the twelve
international unions comprising the
Comm-ittee on Industrial Organiza-
tion. The CIO is headed by John L.
Lewis, president of the United Mine
Workers of America.

Discusses A. F. of L. History

Only four million out of a possible
35 million workers in the United
States are organized, said Mr. Mur-
ray, and indicated that organization
an-d particularly the right of collec-
tive bargaining, is nothing more than
the right of labor to sell its services
at the highest price that it can get—
just as employers organize for the
purpose of controlling prices and con-
ditions of sale.

Turning to a discussion of the
American Federation of Labor, he
stated that for 60 years a few presi-
dents of a few international craft
unions have dominated the labor
scene, and have failed to organize

New Class

For Chapel
Completed

Heinz Memorial Windows
Will Be Set In Position
Early Next Month

Stained glass windows of the
Heinz Memorial Chapel will be in-
stalled starting November 15, accord-
ing to John Weber, secretary and
business manager of the University.

Five windows, to be placed in the
chancel end of the building, will be
put in ﬁrst. Each window in this
section will be thirty feet high, and
will be sixty-ﬁve feet above the ﬂoor
level.

The windows, divided into panels
about three feet high, will be shipped
to Pi-ttsburgh in wooden frames. They
will arrive a few days before instal-
lation begins from the Connick Stu-
dio, Boston, Mass., where they are
now on display.

Scaffolding for the project is al-
ready constructed. F-our skilled men
will work on each window. A. A.
Klimcheck, University architect, be-
lieve-s the ﬁrst set of windows will
be in place about six weeks after
work begins.

Bronze frames, heavily reinforced
on the outside, will support the lead-
ed-stained glass. With the special
process used in this installation, it is
claimed that the windows will be ab-
solutely weathertight, even in the
face of driving rainstorms.

“One of the hardest problems in
making these windows,” says Mr.
Klimcheck, “is to adjust the trans-
parency of the glass so that windows
on the north side, which receive no
direct sunlight, will not appear dark-
er than those on the east.

The ﬁve windows to be placed in
this ﬁrst installation are about one-
sixth of the total needed to ﬁnish
the building. No action has been
taken to place the contracts for the
remaining windows until those al-
ready completed are in place.

Dr. Stewart To Speak A
At Combined Seminar

Dr. Reid T. Stewart, professor
emeritus of mechanical engineering,
will address the meeting of the com-
bined aeronautical and mechanical
engineering seminar, to be held to-
morrow at 11:30 o’clock in Room
108, Cathedral.

Dr. Stewart, who has been associ-
ated with the University for over
ﬁfty years, plans to illustrate his
talk with motion pictures of his
travels in India. In addition to his
work at the University, Dr. Stewart
has done research work with Strom-
berg Carburetor Company, the Na-
tional Tube Company and the Pack-
ard Motor Car Company.

this year. With their mentors, they
will see the ancient Roman ceremony
that signiﬁes the kindling of inex-
tinguishable friendship.

According to legend, Vesta lights
the ﬁre of friendship that is to burn
always. Should the ﬁre ever go out,
d-evils would visit the earth and kill
this goddess and her virgins.

Who Is Carissima?

Lorraine Stancliffe, Ed38, and Ruth
Rosenthal, C38, are in charge of the
ceremony. Parts in the program are

Dorothy Kerr, Ed37, Amicus; Char-
lotte Levy, C39, Amica; Ann Helf-
gott, C39, Tullia; Martha Nietz, Ed
38, Claudia, and Florence Hiller,
BA38, Boy.

Carissima, the daughter of Amicus
and Amica, and representative of the
whole freshman class, is a freshman
girl whose name will be withheld un-
til after the program.

Chanting pri-estesses from the
Women’s Choral are: Betty Alston,
C38, ﬁrst priestess; Ruth Crosby, C39,
second priestess; Sylvia Schwartz,
C38; Helen Kieper, Ed37; Blodwen
Angus, Ed37; and Natalie Rosen,
Ed37.

In addition to freshman women
and their mentors, members of the
YWCA cabinet will be guests. Re-
freshments will be served by the ush-
ers after the program.

One Day Rushing
For Women Slated

Now that the men’s rushing week
is over, the fraternity women of the
campus can concentrate on their own
affairs. The little rushing season has
been scheduled by Panhellenic Coun-
cil for November 15.

This little season consists of one
affair, and one only. On the ap-
pointed Sunday each of the women's
fraternities will sponsor a tea for
rushees. Only upperclass women and
February freshmen are eligible for
fall rushing, according to Panhellenic
rushing rules.

Transfers and NYA students, ac-
cording to the new fall rushing rules
of the fraternities, are ineligible to
be rushed this season. The rules
have been revised by a committee
under the chairmanship of Frances
Calhoun, Ed37.

By next Wednesday the fraternities

must have handed in all eligibility
cards for this semester's rushing.

Pep Meeting

 

Dr. ‘Jock’ Sutherland Listed
As Program Speaker;
Classes Shortened

It's called a Pep Meeting, and it
happens every year. There’s music
and there's cheering. Classes are
shortened, and everyone runs over
to Memorial Hall about 11:30 o’clock
on the Friday morning before the
game.

These pep meetings are always
held just before an outstanding
game. Two years ago it was prior
to the Southern California game.
Last year it came on the day before
the Army came to town. Saturday
Pitt plays Notre Dame, and on Fri-
-day, SFA has scheduled another pep
meeting.

Grotto Affair Will Feature
Pre—Game Pep Meeting
On Friday Evening

 

Twenty minutes of pep meeting for
the Notre Dame game the following
morning is only one of the features
-of the.Engineering Association “dol-
lar” dance at the Grotto Friday eve-
ning. Extraneous as it may seem,
there will be several well-known foot-
=ball personalities at the Grotto for
the celebration. Student enthusiasm
will be aired over the facilities of
Station WWSW.

Rose Nugent, C38, has been chosen
by Chairman William McQuade, CE
37, to lead the affair. It is rumored
that no football will be kicked off at
the EA dance.

Swing music, the specialty of Bob
Duncan's orchestra, will be in vogue
at the EA dance, that is, if an EA
dance can hav-e vogue. It will, how-
ever, have one thing and that is a
gloriﬁed issue of the Nitt Pews, satir-
ical organ of the School of Engineer-
ing, In this issue, the entire Univer-
sity is open to scandal mongers. Ev-
erybody will be taken f-or a ride, at
least that is what the committee has
in mind.

Tickets will be on sale in Alumni
Hall all day tomorrow and Fri-
day. These may be obtained at the
office of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral, at the office of the dean
of the School of Engineering and
Mines, Room 5, Thaw Hall, or from
members of the EA cabinet.

Cabinet members are: Robert Mil-
lar, AE37, president; Alfred Bauman,
CE38, vice-president; Alfred Felder,

ME38, secretary; Charles Blaker,
EE37, treasurer; Robert Duncan,
ChE37; Wayne Canﬁeld, ChE38;

James Shields, IE37; Richard Irvin,
IE38; Phillip Kurtz, ME37; William
Ericson, EE38, and McQuade.

This affair, the EA Annual Fall
Dance, is the opening gun of the en-
gineering social season. Their next
event is a smoker January 14. This
is free to all those attending the
dance.

The EA sponsors two dollar dances
a year; along with each of these is a
smoker. The next dance is held
early next year, February 19.

Briton Airs Views

On Timely Topics

“Meeting Edward VIII on the
street is just like passing Mr. Roose-
velt on the street, don’t you know,”
says Alfred George Hood, chauffeur,
of London.

Alfred George is about, oh, he’d
sye, about forty years old. He drives
a Bentley, which is a low, black car
with the steering wheel on the right-
hand side.

Mr. Hood doesn’t think so much
of American driving. “You know,”
he says, “it is rather confusing at
ﬁrst, turning and driving in your traf-
fic, don’t you know.”

Alfred George had his English
car parked on Parkman Street near
State Hall, Monday. “We’re just go-
ing up to some place called Cleve-
land today. We've been knocking
around Boston and Worcester and
thereabouts, don’t you know. Your
American hills aren't so hard, after
all,” Alfred George granted. “We
don’t have a bit of trouble climbing
them.”

Politics are rather confusing in
America, according to Alfred George.
“I haven’t been in America long
enough to learn the difference be-
tween your Democrats and Republi-
cans. But I like your Mr. Roosevelt.”

“Oh, I sye, here comes the master
now. We'll be moving, young gen-
tlemen. Wish you a lot of luck, don’t
you know. Oh, I sye, do any of you
gentlemen know the best way to get
to Cleveland?”

Aldehydes, Ketones, and Carboxylic
Acids.”

Dr. Franklin, who studied at the
Universities of Kansas, Berlin, and
Johns Hopkins, holds numerous hon-
orary degrees from American uni-
versities. lHe taught at the Univer-
sity of Kansas from 1916 to 1929

Requests For Seat Changes
Must Be In At 5 O’c1ock

At 4:30 o’clock today, in Room
813, Cathedral, there will be an im-
portant meeting of all section lead-
ers for the Student Cheering Block.
At the same time tomorr-ow there will
be a complete rehearsal of all mem-
bers of the block in the Stadium.

“Any changes in the seating ar-
rangements must be made before 5
o’clock today,” said Louis Bearer,
E37, student leader of the Block.
“Requests for changes will be made
only with the understanding that they
will be effective if the adjustments
can be worked out. There must be
a vacancy in the section to which a
cheering block member wishes to
move before a change will be made.”

“Anyone wishing to change sec-
tions must leave their name, present
section, and section desired, in Room
801, Cathedral, today. All members
are required to atten-d tomorrow's re-
hearsal for the Notre Dame stunts;
all those who fail to attend will be
disqualiﬁed from fur-th-er participa-
tion.”

Bearer Schedules

" able for the rest o-f the season.

“Cock Robin” purports to be a
genuine “thriller.” The killer is not
divulged until the last moment; the
important clue is a pair of white
gloves, and the suspects are super-
numerary.

In the cast are: Lea Goldstein, C39,
as the delectable Carlotta, town belle,
who is involved in an almost fatal
love affair with a scoundrel; Joseph
Letteriello, C39 (who has twice played
roles on the professional stage in New
York) as the hired director of the
beneﬁt show in Cope Valley, who is
not backward about bruising people’s
feelings; and Oscar Goodstein, C37,
as the murdered man, despised by
one and all.

Cast Listed

Julian Cleveland, a middle-aged
lawyer, will be played by Charles
Blavker, E37; Richard Lane, arejected
lover, by Arthur Kelley, C37; Clarke
Torrance, a rather thick young man,
by John Glasser, BA38; Henry
Briggs, apparently harmless stage
director, by Meyer Rabinovitz, C38;
Doctor Edward Grace, an elderly
gentleman, by Ralph‘Kessler, C38;
Alice Montgomery, a buxom female,
by Helen Ackerman, C38; Maria
Scott, a beady-eyed spinstress, by
Jeanette Swartz, C38, and Helen
Maxwell, n1iddle—aged widow, by
Mary Virginia Delph, G.

Players are requesting that every-
one who possibly is able, wear for-
mal attire, to give the occasion a
more festive mood.

Mayor To Attend

Cornelius D. Scully, selected Mayor
of Pittsburgh by Council to ﬁll the
vacancy created by William N. Mc-
Nair when he resigned from office a
week and a half ago, will deﬁnitely
be present at tomorrow evening’s
performance.

His ex-honor, former Mayor Mc-
Nair, may possibly be there at the
same time, according to word re-
ceived fro-m his secretary yesterday.

This morning at 11:30 o’clock, Let-
teriello, Lea Goldstein and Helen
Ack-erman will take part in “Foot-
lights and Stardust,” a radio pro-
gram over WWSW.

A preliminary performance of
“Geek Robin” was given at Irene

A Warning To The lrish

OTH THE FOOTBALL and cheering groups met quite a test

B

The football team, battling valiantly, lost a tough decision, a de-
cision that meant much. On the other hand, the student cheering

section came through with colors ‘a-ﬂyin’ in their inaugural. From ,

the opposite side of the ﬁeld the solid blue and gold “P” was the
only ﬂash of brightness during the entire afternoon, at least to
the Pitt rooters.

Saturday, a ﬁghting Pitt team will proceed to “Knock Hell
Out of Notre Dame.” They’ve got to do it. Notre Dame has done
just that to Pitt in s'omethin'g like twelve straight athletic contests.
This must be Pitt’s turn, especially to revenge that 71-yard scam-
per of last Saturday’s Rockne upset.

While it is admitted that the boys down on the ﬁeld pay lit-
tle attention to what goes on in the stands, having their hands
more than full with eleven frisky, tough, and quick-thinking gents
on the opposite side of the line, they do feel something there, if
there is something there. SFA’s' cheering block will be there
against Notre Dame, and all we can say is “Don’t say we didn’t
warn you, Irish !”

"Who Said Cock Robin Was Dead?"

THE QUESTION “Who Killed Cock Robin?” becomes very
much alive tonight when the Pitt Players under the direction
of Carl B. Cass present the Rice-Barry play “Cock Robin” on the
stage of the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

“Mighty Casey” Cass and his student crew have worked hard,
under the most difficult handicaps. Last spring, this same “Cock
Robin” was scheduled to leave its nest, but then along came St.
Patrick’s Day, and together with other things the bird’s wings

were clipped so that it never left its shelter of the direction stage.

Re-cast, re—staged, and starting at the very beginning once
more, Cass has ﬁnally re-built “Cock Robin.” Tonight and tomor-
row night this student acting group has the best wishes of students
and faculty alike. An adequate student attendance would be the
very smallest show of appreciation and consideration by which
this University could recognize their efforts.

Zoology Experimenter Looks
For Discriminating Insects

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr. diately for the red color ﬁeld. This

last week in a dark, damp, and exceedingly wet Pitt Stadium. 5

In the laboratory, where bugs and
swordtails cause more excitement
than a moyoralty squabble, 2 new ex-
periment is in progress.

The experiment is to determine
whether insects can discriminate be-
tween colors, and to ﬁnd out how
thoroughly developed is their sense
of light perception.

It all’ began last semester when
Harold Howland, graduate ‘assistant
in zoology, assembled his equipment
and reconsidered his hypotheses. Mr-.
Howland worked with the cockroaches
from February 18 to May 14, making
several hundred trials in color por-



Tho’ experiments with the roaches
were identical in one respect. Every
roach, when it was placed in the “cof-
ﬁn/’, the large box that permits a
graduated light intensity, made imme-

is explained, Mr. Howland said, by
the fact that roaches are negatively
phototropic, that is, they respond to
darkness, and that the red color ap-
pears darker than the other lights.

The roaches were of little value to
the color perception test for this rea-'
son, Mr. Howland claimed. “But, on
the other hand, the grasshoppers have
been rather encouraging,” he said.
The lights have been tested by a pho-
totnete-"r to be sure that they are of
equal brilliance. The grasshopper,

Pre-Legal Group
To Hold Smoker

Common Pleas Court Judge
Scheduled To Address
John Marshall Club

 

Judge George Reed Moore of the
Court of Common Pleas will be the
featured speaker at the annual
smoker of the John Marshall Club,
honorary pre-legal fraternity, on Oc-
tober 28.

The smoker will be the occasi-on of
the annual fall tapping of members
into the pre-legal fraternity. Ap-
proximately 15 students will be
tapped at the smoker.

“Systematic collections of names of
pre-legal students have been made in
all classes in the Department of Eco-
nomics and Political Science,” said
Hubert Teitlebaum, C37, president.
“If we have not reached every pre-
legal student in these two de-
partments, those that we have missed
should leave their names in the office
of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral.”

Qualiﬁcations for admission to the
fraternity are 45 credits and a qual-
ity point average of 1.6.

Stanley Rogaliner, C37, is chair-
man of the smoker. Nathan Schwartz,
BA37, is chairman of the Speakers
Committee; Valera Grapp, C37, and
Howard Engelman, C38, are serving
on the Refreshments Committee, and
Evelyn Lowy, C38, and William
Stark, C38, are co-chairmen of the
Membership Committee.

“All pre-legal students, as well as
other interested undergraduates, are
invited to this smoker,” Teitlebaum
said, “whether or not they are eligi-
ble to be tapped at this time.”

Nicodeinus Ends

Year's sojourn Here

   

Nicodemus has become an estab-
lished tradition at the University. He
has successfully completed one year's
stay in the cramped interior of an
aquarium in Room 917, Cathedral.

_ Perhaps we had better tell you, in

case you didn’t know, that Nicode-
mus is a turtl-e. His principal activi-
ties to date have been spent in grab-
bing up bits of pork rind, ﬂoating
majestically past some green gala-
manders, and staring out at wide-
eyed students listening to Dr. Wil-
liams t-ell of his exploits in the Ama-
zon jungles.

Technically speaking, he is a west.
ern painted turtle with a Well-f-ormed
plastron and carapace, deﬁned mark-
ings, typical aqua-tic tendencies, who
bolts his food. But he doesn’t owe his
popularity with biology majors to
these latter characteristics.

You see, Nicodemus has person-
ality.

Barton Claims Students
Find Depression Past

As far as the University student
is concerned, the depression is well
on its way to obscurity. Those who
ﬁnd it necessary to work part-time
while attending the University no

» longer have a hard time ﬁnding em-

ployment, according to J. Clyde Bar-

; ton, director of the placement bureau.

Mr. Barton states that “the demand
for students wishing to obtain work
will be greater this year than that of
any other year since the depression
set in. Despite this fact, there are
slightly fewer people who desire po-

3 sitions this year.”

From all reports given by students,
there was more work this summer
‘than during the previous ﬁve sum-
mers, and, from all indications, there
will be increased summer work in the
1 coming year.

The Employment Bureau which is
located in the dean of men's oﬁlce
- takes special care to keep the oﬁ"e'red
jobs up to a certain level. Degrading
jobs and unﬁt employment are not of-
fered to students. Mr. Barton reports
that the students cooperate perfectly
and have the right attitude toward
1; all jobs.

Novice Cage Tourney

Starts Off

With Thud

Dust, Wrestling, Goose-eggs Feature Opening Monday
As Smallest Number Of Novices In History
Take Part In Carlson’s Annual Event

With basketball that sometimes resembled a wrestling
matcli, Dr. Carlson’s novice basketball tournament held its ﬁrst
session Monday afternoon on the gym ﬂoor of the Stadium. Due
to their grappling tendencies, the players thoroughly dusted off
the gym ﬂoor that had accumulated a year’s covering of dirt.

Only four teams were able to be
made up because of the small turn-
out of entrants. The number of
players in the tourney this year is
the smallest number that has ap-
peared for the ﬁrst games since the
establishment o-f the affair.

In the ﬁrst game the Mudhens
came from behind to defeat the Wild-
ca-ts by the small margin of two
points, the ﬁnal score being 24-22.
While the Wildcats scored three
points in the ﬁrst quarter, the Mud-
hens loafed along and didn’t b-other
the scorer. During the second quar-
ter the Mudhens still were in the van
with the score 12-5, much to the ad-
vantage of the Wildcats.

Hens Start Peckin’

Although they d-id not take the
lead in the third quarter the Mud-
hens did succeed in throwing the ball
through the hoop more often than
their opponents, garnering 10 points
for themselves while the Cats man-
aged only eight. The fourth period
saw the Mudhens rise up and tame
the Cats, scorin-g almost as many
points as they did in the previous
period, making nine points while
holding their opponents to only two.

Mendlow was the individual high-
scorer in the ﬁrst game, making 11
points for the Hens. On the Wild-
cats, Murray and Shaffer tallied six
points apiece to take the second high-
scoring honors and l-ea-d the scoring
for their team.

In the second game featuring the
Yellows and the Barebacks, the f-or-
mer won 21-14, with Naismith and
Shiring taking the scoring honors,
collecting eight points each for the
winners.

Yellows Show Color!

As in the ﬁrst game the winners
drew nothing but a goose egg for the
ﬁrst period while allowing their op-
ponents to attach two points to the
scoreboard. The score stood 4-2
with the larger score on the side of
the Barebacks, but the Yellows
staged a scoring spree in the third
period that gathered in 13 points to
their opponents’ three. In the ﬁnal
period the losers attempted to regain
the lead by scoring seven points but
it proved insufficient and the Yellows
were given the game, 21-14.

Jesko an-d Z-eleznik shared the of-
ficiating duties in the ﬁrst game and
Garcia took over their duties for the
second. Dr. Carlson, although on
the sidelines, coached, advised the
referees, and took care of the stop
watch.

Professors Pen
Advanced Texts

Sociology, Chemistry Books
To Appear On Campus

Notice of two books recently pub-
lished by University professors has
been received.

Dr. Howard A. Phelps, professor of
sociology, publishes his “Principles
and Laws of Sociology,” an advanced
text, intended for students in their
junior or senior year who have al-
ready taken an elementary course in
sociology.

The book offers a resume .of the
developments in each of the main
ﬁelds of sociology, constructing a
survey of sociological principles and
social phenomena.

Dr. Carl Engelder, professor of an-
alytical chemistry, in collaboration
with Tobias H. Dunkelberger, grad-
uate assistant in chemistry, and Wil-
liam J. Schiller of Mount Mercy Col-
lege, has completed his text, “Semi-
Micro Qualitative Analysis.”

The volume, published recently,
deals with microchemistry in its sev-
eral branches. It attempts to sim-
plify the techniques of microanalysis,
and is intended for advance courses
in qualitative analysis. The more
important advances among the mass
of new material appearing in recent
chemical literature have been in-
cluded.

 

Freshman Swimmers

Pat Corr, varsity swimming coach,
has announced that positions are still
open on the freshman swimming
team and manager’s staff. The var-
sity plungers are practicing in the
Trees Gym pool for their ﬁrst meet,
which is only a few weeks away.

Anyone interested in trying out for
the team or as a manager, contact
Mr. Corr, in the Athletic Office, or
see Russ Lindberg, the captain.

Meet Aliquippa

Three High School Squads
To Be Met This Week

 

Some freshmen are still being
rushed. Those who form the squad
of the freshman cross-c-ountry team
are being rushed through a fast and
furious harrier schedule. Today they
meet Aliquippa High School, on Fri-
day it’s Langley, and next Monday
they bump in.to the championship
Canonsburg team.

Last week the Pitt ﬁrst year men
were defeated by Allderdice, 25-30.
Allderdice is the present city high
cross-country champion. They also
have a second place in the state
meets on their last year’s records.

Frank Chatham, star of the novice
track meet, ﬁnished in ﬁrst place in
this meet. Jvoe Kristufek was fourth
and Clifford and Mclrney came in
with some point-winning places.

Experience still seems to be the
chief deﬁci-t in the freshman score-
card, but Coach Olson is nursing
them along through a schedule that
includes, for the greater majority,
prominent high school teams. A
meet with the Penn State freshmen
is scheduled to materialize in the
near future.

Chess Team Wins

While fraternities rushed and the
football men were snug in bed Fri-
day night, the University Chess team
pondered out a 3-2 victory over mem-
bers of the Pittsburgh Chess Club.

Members of the University team
were: Leonard Hepner, C37, captain;
Sidney Magram, C37 ; Leonard Sacks,
C37; Edward Philipp, C40, and A1-
bert Iancu, C38.

Basketball Coach Bemoans
Fate Of Pitt Squad For
Coming Season

By Bob Angros

This is getting serious. Unless Dr.
Carlson’s Novice Basketball Tourna-
ment uncovers a few players who are
deﬁnitely not novices, the popular
mentor might have to don a uniform
and draft his managers if he wants
to give the varsity squad a scrim-
mage.

“I lost seven men from last year’s
freshman team mostly from scholastic
diﬂiculties,” bemoans Coach Carlson,
“and right now I don’t have enough
players to stand the gaff for our com-
ing season. If my novice tourney
doesn’t unearth some possibilities, I
may have to make a general call for
candidates.”

Coupled with this freshman diffi-
culty is the loss by graduation of
Captain Ted Roderick, Jim Leach,
Bob Nickle and Pete Noon, all mem-
bers of last year’s varsity squad.

Included in the list of unfortunates
lopped off by methodic professors are:
Manny Hyatt, brother of the immor-
tal “Chipper Charlie”; Smith, star

forward, and Sobehart, who also
shone brightly in Coach Kowallis’
constellation. Survivors of the frosh

squad are: Red Scott, guard; Joe Fa-
bel, center; Sam Lindsay, guard;
Ed Lawry, of the basketball famous
Lawrys, and Ed Schieding, forward.

Although Dr. Carlson is looking for
a few gems in the rough, this alone
is not suﬁicient reason for the tour-
ney. “It’s the chance of a lifetime
to put your basketball talent to good
use,” he said, “and the least you can
get out of it is a good time. And
don’t forget, there will be prizes for
everything, from the biggest feet to
the thickest head.”

Tennis Match Postponed

Because of continual bad weather
and the lateness of the season, Man-
ager Bud Mayer has postponed the
University tennis tournament until
next spring. It will be played be-
fore the call for varsity and freshman
tennis candidates. If, however, any
players are able to ﬁnish their match
before next spring, they are urged to
do so and report the results to Man-
ager Mayer.

Will Someone Please
Name This Panther!

“When cross the campus you can
he-ar a mighty roar, guess who? Aye,
the Panther!”

A contest ﬁnishing Friday is be-
ing held under the supervision of
Frank Carver, publicity director of
athletics, to give the University Pan-
ther a nickname. Many know that
the lion is known by the title Leo,
the leopard as Spotty, and the kan-
garoo as Jumping Joe, but a name
for the Panther has not been known
to the world.

Grizzly, Floppie, Flossie, or Susie-
Belle might be ﬁtting. However, Mr.
Carver wants the contributions of the
student body to decide the monikker
of our Panther.

The recipient of the names will be
Mr. Carver. He is located in the
Athletic Building on DeSota Street
just below the entrance to the Sta-
dium. A prize, two tickets to the
Pitt-Penn State game, November 7,
will be awarded to the donor -of the
winning name.

Panther Cubs Set
For Kiski Tussle

Starting Lineup To Undergo
Changes By Game Time

With a promise that there will be
many changes in the starting lineup,
Coach Mike Milligan sent his Pan-
ther yearlings through a tough scrim-
mage in preparation for the tussle
with the highly-touted Kiski eleven
at Saltsburg on Friday.

The Panther Cubs showed last Sat-
urday in the encounter with the Tech
Plebes that they have the making of
a strong offensive as well as defen-
sive team. Much of the power has
been shown at the center of the line
with Etze holding the center berth
and Pennypacker and Corace at the
guards.

Although hampered by the muddy
ﬁeld in Saturday’s grid battle, the
Pitt Freshman football team tallied
5 ﬁrst downs to 4 by the Skibos be-
cause of their driving power. On a
dry ﬁeld the Little Panthers might
have been able to shake loose a num-
ber of good ball carriers in Cassiano,
Lovett and Brundzo.

In former years the Panther Cubs
have won most of their opening
games. This year, however, marks
two straight seasons that the Milligan
men have dropped their opening

game.

Last Saturday the Dukes went to
town against Pitt's Golden Panthers
at the Stadium. This Saturday the
Irish come to town against the same
Panthers at the same Stadium.
Before the largest crowd ever
packed in at the DeSota Street Bowl,
Elmer Layden’s undefeated Notre
Dame eleven and “Jock” Sutherland’s
Duke-wrecked Panther machine meet
in what appears to be one of the
major games in the country.

The Duquesne upset last week is a
hard thing for the Panthers to forget,
but Sutherland and his Panthers are
not through with the 1936 season yet.
And let that be a warning to a Notre
Dame team, a Fordham team, a Ne-
braska outﬁt, a Carnegie Tech eleven.
and a Penn State group!

As usual with a Sutherland defeat,
no excuses as to why the Dukes plas-
tered the Panthers have come from
the Pitt camp. There are student
murmurings of a let-down, of taking
it too easy, of just not being able to

rage 3

Panthers Forget Dukes;
Next Are Those Irish!

click, but there are few who say that
the Dukes didn’t deserve to win
against the brand of ball put out by
the Panthers.

Notre Dame, always one of the
high spots in a Pitt season, has gone
through three games, licking Tech,
21-7, Washington, 14-6, and Wiscon-
sin, 27-0. So that going into the game
Saturday, the Layden eleven are
favored to hand Pitt its second defeat
of the year. That would make it two
in a row for the Panthers and it
would take a lot of leaﬁng through
Pitt records to ﬁnd a year when a
Sutherland team dropped two suc-
cessive games.

There are to be several changes
in the ﬁrst team make-up of the Pan-
thers. Although Sutherland kept the
proposed changes quiet, the Panther
line will be undoubtedly shifted
around a little. Lezouski over Dalle
Tezze, Hensley over Adams, Hoffman
over Souchak are a few guesses as to
the probable changes.

Untermeyer Stresses

Cultures

In Address

Poet Lauds Commonplace Of Contemporary Literature;
Emphasizes American Renaissance In Address
Before National English Instructors

By Marion E. Price

“There has never been so lavish a series of cultures in Amer-
ica as at present,” stated Louis Untermeyer, noted poet and lit-
erary critic, in his address before the National Co-uncil of Teach-
ers of English Saturday afternoon.

Speaking on the subject of “The Glory of the Commonplace,”
Mr. Untermeyer pointed out the importance of contemporary lit-
erature, principally because of the usage of common, everyday

subjects.

“Today we have no Miltonic apos-
trophes to the universe at large,” he
declared, “for modern writers have
discovered the glory of the common-
place.” Lindsay, Faulkner, Frost,
Robinson, and Hemingway he p-ointed
out as the leaders of the new age be-
cause of their realization of the
poetical possibilities in ordinary and
colloquial phrases.

Reads Frost Poem

Frost, Mr. Untermeyer thinks, is
one of the three greatest bucolic
poets of world literature. Reading
Frost’s poem, “Stopping by a Woods
on a Snowy Evening,” the speaker
declared that the simpler the poem
the deeper its implication.

“Westward the course of culture
takes its way,” Mr. Untermeyer stated
in his discussion of modern American
cultural developments. “Until 1900
our literature was colonial; but since
then we have discovered the authen-
ticity of our country. Having dis-
covered our own syncopated stress,
our own idiom, we are on the verge
of a renaissance. Today our arts, es-
pecially literature, are beginning to
inﬂuence the world,” he continued.

In an interview later granted the
reporter, Louis Untermeyer denied
the theory of “scientiﬁc writing.”
“Poe ﬁrst wrote his poetry, then later
rationalized concerning how he had
done it,” he said.

Anticipates Renaissance

Seated in a chair which formerly
belonged to Oliver Goldsmith, Mr.
Untermeyer answered questions con-
cerning America’s literary future.

Mr. Untermeyer anticipates the lit-
erary renaissance in the middle west-
ern states. New England has burnt
herself out, hence will not take a lead.
“But as for a complete amalgamation
of American elements into one com-
plete culture,” Untermeyer con-
cluded, “there will probably be no
such thing.’

Fine Arts Department Opens Exhibit
Of Reproductions Of Living Artists

In connecti-on with a country wide
exhib-iti-on of living American art, the
Department of Fine Arts today opens
an exhibit of 12 reproductions of
work d-one by 12 contemporary Amer-
ican artists.

The pictures are being exhibited in
the ﬁne arts library, Room 103, State
Hall, for the next two weeks from
8:30 to 5 o’clock during week days,
and from 8:30 to 1 o’clock, Satur-
days.

The group of pictures featured in
this showing is the ﬁrst of four groups
to be exhibited by the Department of
Fine Arts during this year.

Represented in this exhibit are the
efforts of well-known artists. Two of
the painters, Reginald Marsh and
George Grosz, who are interested in
social and economic ideas, do work
for the “New Republic.”

Another, Peggy Bacon, produced
“Off With Their Heads,” a book of
caricatures. Then there are those
whose names are connected with the
International such as Guy Pene du
Bois, member of the Jury of Award;
John Sloan, and William J. Glackens,
who won the Garden Club prize.

Each of the pictures was repro-
duced by the collotype process for
the purpose of this show and, accord-
ing to Walter Hovey, acting head of
the Department, is “extremely well
produced.”

Mr, Hovey states that “the people
chosen by the judges are the most
representative of the American art-
ists and it is very gratifying to feel
that a consciousness of American

Undergraduate Club To Tap
Members, Award Prizes
During Masquerade

 

Cap and Gown Undergraduate
Club’s Masquerade Ball, which will
be held at the Pittsburgh Country
Club the evening of October 30th,
has planned a busy evening for the
costumed couples who will traipse to
the dance.

Besides the costume review which
will parade before the judges in com-
petition for the ﬁrst two prizes, the
Undergraduate Club will conduct a
tapping ceremony of men who have
been connected with previous pro-
ductions of Cap and Gown. Break-
ing a tradition which has stood since
1926 allowing eligibility for member-
bership only to men who have par-
ticipated in the cast or chorus for
two years or on the production staff
for three years, the members of the
Cap and Gown Undergraduate Club
have eﬁ"ected a change in their con-
stitution vhich allows men who have
participated in any part of a Cap
and Gown show for one year to be
eligible for induction into the club.

Ben W. Baskin, C37, president of
the Undergraduate Club, has an-
nounced that the tapping ceremony
will be held at midnight.

This is the ﬁrst time in the his-
tory of Cap and Gown productions
that a tapping ceremony has been
held not in direct conjunction with
the actual production. According to
Baskin the change in the constitu-
tion has been effected to allow men
who have participated in previous
Cap and Gown shows to take an ac-
tive participation in pre-Cap and
Gown work such as publicity, social
affairs and general student contacts
without waiting for an elapse of two
or three years before eligibility.

Forty-three men have petitioned
for membership.

There will be a meeting of the
Undergraduate Club today at 2:30
o’clock in Room 821, Cathedral.

over 30 million unorganized workers.

“In 1934, Lewis and his supporters
offered a plan of organizing along
industrial lines, which the San Fran-
cisco convention approved, and which
the executive council refused to rec-
ognize.”

Thus, according to Mr. Murray, the
Atlantic City convention met, and
ended in disorder aand misunder-
standing because the executive coun-
cil refused to set down those indus-
tries which should be organized along
industrial lines. The plan called for
the contribution of $500,000 by
Lewis’ committee, and the raising of
one million dollars by the other mem-
ber-unions of the Federation, f-or the
purpose of organizing basic indus-
tries.

Steel Drive Begins

On June 17 of this year, the CIO
organized the S-teel Workers’ Organ-
izing Committee, under the chairman-
ship of Mr, Murray. “Moving into
an industry which was traditionally
non-union, and with no background
as far as organization was concerned,
we had great obstacles to overcome,”
Mr. Murray said.

“We were combating a genuine
fear on the part of the workers that
had been built up over generations.
We were stacking up against the
most powerful ﬁnancial and industrial
organization in the history of the
country. In many instances, this or-
ganization has controlled and directed
economic well-being, as well as the
government of our country.”

“I proceeded upon the theory that
citizens in any enterprise cannot en-
joy any substantial political rights
without securing fundamental eco-
nomic rights,” Mr. Murray continued.

“By means of an educational at-
tack, we have succeeded in bringing
approximately 800 employee repre-
sentatives, out of about 1,700, into
the ranks of the Amalgamated Asso-
ciation of Iron, Steel and Tin Work-
ers. We combat these employee rep-
resentation gr-oups on the basis that
they are no more than subterfuges to
discourage the organization of legiti-
mate independent trade unions,” he
concluded.

Blackwood Speaks

Dr. Oswald H. Blackwood, profes-
sor of physics, is to be the speaker
at the Physics Colloquium today. Dr.
Blackwood will address the meeting
on the Conference on Industrial Phys-
ics held recently at Penn State Col-
lege, and will stress the increased de-
mand in industry for people well

Copies of the 1937 edition of the
rules and regulations governing the
music and speech contests to be spon-
sored this year by the Pennsylvania

The winners will be eligible for the
nine district contests. Those who
take ﬁrst place in these will qualify
for the tenth annual state ﬁnal con-
test to be held in Altoona April 23
