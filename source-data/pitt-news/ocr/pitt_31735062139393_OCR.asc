At 10:30 Mpnday morning’ about

‘100 Roosevelt adherents and others

interested gathered on the steps of
Thaw Hail. Bernard Cooper, ’l5, of
the Bull Moose Club, introduced the
speakers. ~

Dr. Samuel Callen of the Fourth
Presbyterian Church discussed the
Progressive Party and the candidacy
of Mr. Roosevelt from the standpoint
of the average layman. He said in
substance: ‘

“The Progressive idea is no "inno-
Jvation. It started more than 15 years
ago in the ‘Iowa idea,’.and was occa-
sioned by David B. Henderson’s re-
tirement from public life. From Iowa
it spread allover the Middle West,
and when Senator La
health would not permit him~to con-
tinue in the Progressive leadership,

Colonel Roosevelt, at the earnest so-'
. licitation of seven

state governors,

More Go To-Night.

 

Pitt’s football warriors accom-
panied by a large delegation of stu-
dents pulled out of the.Union station
at 9:40 this morning, for Baltimore.
The team will arrive in'Baltimore to-

1 night and will spend the night in that

city, going to Annapolis early in the
morning, where they play the strong
Navy team in the afternoon. '

Other students that were unable to
leaveon the morning‘ train will go

on_the 11:18 train to-night and will.

arrive. in Annapolisin time for the
game to—morrow. It is expected that
quite a large delegation will ‘be on
hand to cheer the Blue .and . Gold
players in the game to—morrow.
While the outlook is not the best
that might be hoped for, by reason
of the fact that Capta-in Galvin will
.-be out of the game on account of in-
juries received in the contest last Sat-
girday, the men
they will make a‘ good showing
against t‘he Navy. The Annapolis

‘squad is, like Pitt, composed of many’

new men this year and the battle be-

one of the ﬁercest~~'of the year.

Most of the students that are mak-
ing the trip will remain in Washing-

‘_THE PITT I _WE.EKLY'

STUDENTS ‘TAKE

. ‘ CHARGE or ASSEMBLY

College Department Holds Interest-
' ing Meeting—Leaders Make
Speeches.

Aniunusually large crowd attended
the College Assembly on Wednesday
morning. »The program ‘Was in
charge. of the students and was con-
ducted in a highly entertaining man-
ner. »

After the preliminary music and
the reading of the announcements ‘by

.Dean. Fetterman, the meeting was

turned over to the students, with Mr.

Wet-tach, ’l3, as chairman. The lat-

ter had arranged a very pleasing -pro-
gram of speeches and music.
Mr. Wettach opened the program
with a humorous talk in which he
tried to convince us that he was the
poorest‘ speechmaker in the country.
,.iMiss M. A. Moldenhauer, ’l3, then’
enterta-ined us with .a piano solo. That
her music was apprec”iat'ed Was shown

I by the fact that she was encored sex‘;-

eral times. a
Miss Helen Frost, ’13, as ﬁrst

speaker, very interestingly explained

;t-heaim and plans of the Y. W. C. A. -

this year, claiming that the member-
ship would be very large andthat the
Y. M. C. A.:would have‘to compete
with them for the assembly room.

= -v Mr. T. P. Harvey, ’l4, took up the

boys’ side of -the‘ question for the Y.
M“. ,C. A., promising to give the Y.
W. C. A." a good’ ﬁght for the posses-
sion of chapel as a meeting place..He
spoke brieﬂy and clearly on the aims
ofthe Y. M. -C. A.

The chairman then presented Mr.
H. R. »Allison, '14, ‘representing the
Forensic Club. He showed very con-
clusively the beneﬁts one derives
from this training. ' ' »
._ Very appropriately Mr. Wettach
announced that we would sing
5‘Gandeamus Igitur.” It ‘was a poor
‘attempt, as few knew the music. .

The ﬁnal speaker was C. K. Mur-

\ ray, ’14, who, in"a forceful manner,

brought home to us the urgent need
of supporting the Y. M. C. A. As a
member of the student senate, he also
explained the organization of that

‘ body and its relation to the students.

' 'The chairman" closed the -students’
.part of the program bx another of his
interesting and humorous
stories.
~ Dean Fetterman congratulated the
students for their good work and said
he hoped that another “student
-chapel” would be held .at a future

' date.

LECTURE ON TELEPHONE

 

Superintendent of Cf, D. & P. Com-
pany Addresses Assembly.
« as

Wednesday morning at the engi-
neering chapel, Mr. S. P. Grace, Gen-
eral Superintendent of the C., D. as:
P.~'I‘ele_ph‘one Co., gaye an interest-
ing lecture on _“The Telephone,” il-
lustrating it with,special apparatus.

In beginning he mentioned some
telephone statistics,}bringing out the
facts that there are 6,500,000 tele-
phones in use in the United States,
and that they are three times as com-
mon here as in Great Britain and the
He rehearsed the princi-
:ples of sound as applied to the tele-
phone, giving to Prof. Daveen of Co-
lumbia, the credit for having ﬁrst dis-
covered the present theory. After a
brief description of the instrument it-
self, Mr. Grace demonstrated by a

miniature switchboard the workings

of a modern exchange. He showed
howfa connection is‘ made, where
both parties belong to the same ex-
change, and the ‘somewhat differertc
-process required when the parties
are in diﬁerent exchanges. . The ‘con-
nections are made by a system of
plugs, red, green and whiter lights,
and keys, too complicated to describe
in blef. Mr. Grace then gave instru-
ments to two students on opposite
sides of the room, and demonstrated
by actual talking the duties of the
operator. He isaid he was sure that
his auditors would not be so im-
patient-hereafter when the “central”
girl makes a slight mistake, or is too
slow. As a further illustration sev-.

eral slides were thrown on the screen, i

showing some_ views of a

change in operation.

HEAR’I_‘ TO HEART TALK
- TO ECONOMIC STUDENTS

 

Dr. James I. Johnston spoke to.-the
students of Schooliof Economics at
their regular Wednesday meeting on
“Clean Living.” It was a valuable
talk to men. In clean “language, with
forceful expression the speaker drove
his message of warning home. The
eager attention of those present was
his from the star.t. The students left
the room appreciating two» funda-
mental truths; ﬁrst, a full knowledge
of the laws that govern the working
of the bocly; second, that a clean life
pays, not only in ethical satisfaction,
but pays as, a material investment for
a clean life is a big asset in business.

THE CARLISLE GAME

It is not often that afteam is de-
feated by the score that the Pitt team

' .lost to the Indians last Saturday and
’ yetmakes a ‘favorable impression on

the student body of the University.
But. since. that game last week there.
ha's_been hardly a kick from the mem-

playing of the team in that game. The.
Blue and Gold played better’ ball
against- the men from Carlisle than
they have played against any other
team this year.‘ We lost simply be-
cause the Indians playe_d -the kind of\
ball that would defeat any team in
the United States.

The interference of the Carlisle
men on their plays around the ends

1 was ‘the best that has ever been seen

in Pittsburgh, and perhaps‘ the best
that has ever been displayed on any
gridiron. It seemed that every man
on the team was right in front of the
man that wascarrying the ball every
time that the play around an end was

1' started. No team in the world would

have been able to break up their inl
terference, unless’ they were able to
come from -behind and tackle thevrun-A
ner. ‘ _

0 We reiterate the statement that be-
fore -the time of the W. & J. game the
last of the-coming month, Pitt will
havea team on the ﬁeld that will give
the Red & Black the toughest game
that they ever played in Pittsburgh.
The material is there—-—it is develop-

‘ ing slowly but surely—and by the last

laplof the season the ‘team will have
hit its true stride.

 

CLASS OFFICERS

1’ Tliis is the time in the year when
the various _classes of the several
schools in the University are electing
their of_ﬁ-cers for the coming year. The
matter of the election of men to hold
the .positions of trust and honor in
any class is a serious one-r-much more
so than many of thestudents of the
University.-seem to think. iUpon these
men-is placed the responsibility for
"the success of the class. They are
the men -that must take the initiative
in all matters pertaining to the wel-
farce of'the class. They must have
the power'=to make all the members of
the class work in harmony forthe
beneﬁt of~all. ' e ' ~

At the election of ofﬁcers, all petty
grievances should be set aside, all
foolish jealousies should be smoth-
ered, and the men that are elected
should be the men that every one is
satisﬁed are. able to perform
duties that are thrust upon them.

Men that ‘are willing to make all
sorts of sacriﬁces in order to perform
their work, ‘men that are endowed
with a goodly supply of ‘common
sense, and ’men,that are known to be
honest through" and through, are the
men that should be given the posi-
tions of honor by all the classes of
the University! What does it‘ gain a
man if he gain a certain pqsition if
he be unable to cope with the prob-
lems ofthe position that ‘he has'at—
ta-ined? _ v

The same thing may-b said in the
matter of the election of student sen-
ators andother offices that are open
to the ,members of the .student body
to ﬁll by “means of popular election.

Be sure that the men that are elected
to ﬁlleertain positions are qualiﬁed
to  the office, and there .can be no
doubt’ that the-men that are elected

WEEKLY
THE RIGHT SPIRIT

At the weekly convocation last Fri-
day morning a certainimemberiof the
student body got up and made . a
speech on college spirit that was the
best effort that has been produced in
the University for a long time. The
speaker is not an or_ator—not even a
ﬁrst-class public speaker-—but he had
the right idea at heart and. ai faults
in the delivery of the spe were
soon forgotten on account of the
splendid college spirit that was dis-
played by him. He had his very soul
in what ‘he was. saying and meant
every .w;ﬁd that he uttered. It is al-
together likely that the splendid
showing of the Pitt rootersat the In-
dian game was the direct result of the
chapel speech of Friday mprning.

"#CHATTER Box.  

If we .were to go by the score we
would have to search among some
ancient‘ and dust covered documents
in onder to ﬁnd when a University
team” had been beaten so badly as the
team was beaten on Saturday by the
Indians. Yet, we came away from

a.great game and you know Well it

game. We were satisﬁed that our
team, while it ‘had been beaten _badly
according to the score, was by’ no
means disgraced. When we glance at
the ﬁgures of that score we can_say
with all truth, “Figures still continue
to lie.” " - ,_ .
If the game did nothing else -it gavr;
us the assurance that on the 16th and
28th of November our boys will- give
a good account of themselves. I dare
say that notwithstanding the easy vic-
tory over “Tech,” practice was re-
sumed on Monday in a little town not
far from here, especially, when the
scouts brought back the word that
Pitt is rounding into old time form.
It was good to hear the rootcrs on
Saturday. They were in the game at
all] tunes. The ‘cheer that went up
w en the game was over sounded, if
anything, a little stronger than the
one at the beginning. That is the
spirit, fellows! It will win games for
us and will win respect for our loy-
alty. You know the linesz '
“For the hardest man,in the world to
beat
Is the man who
of defeat.” _
A There is one thing in connection
with the game that should be criti-
cized. On the sign boards about town
was a large ‘poster on which was an
alleged picture of Thorpe and an in-
scription calling attention to the,fact
that hewas to play against Pitt. This
poster was paid for by our Athletic
Committee. This might have been a
good’ business “stunt” but it ‘ill be-
comes a university to indulge in any
such advertising. If there is any one
we want the people of Pittsburgh to

rrruch_of -commercialism and com-
mercialism is'the curse of athletics
in American Universities. The day
can not be far distant when some one
of great courage and conviction -is
‘going _to strike a blow at this curse.
We hope and pray for hiin and his
time. Meanwhile let us not advertise
.“Jirn” Thorpe—with all due respect
to'his prowess-——or any other man at
the expense of Pitt. It is a sign of

very poor taste',on our par .

THE GYPSY. -

 

A two-act operatta by Frank Pix-
ley and Gustave Luders, entitled
“The Gypsy,” is the attraction at the

Alvin Theater next week. The set-.

ing of the play is a typical gypsy
camp situated in an English forest.
Mr. Pixley, the author, spent a num-

ber of years among these gypsys and _

depicts their lifevin an elaborate trian-
ner. These authors were also respon-
sible for a number of successful
operattas, including .“The Prince .of
Pilsen,” so with an all—star cast “The
Gypsy” will be worth while “seeing.

“THE DIVORCE.”

G ’Twas Shakespeare who wrote
“Conscience makes cowards of us
all,” and next week the golden oppor-
tunity Pl'esents itself, which makes it
incumbent upon each and every one
of us to
which we‘ all possess, in a greater or
lesser degree, in order that we ‘stand

examine that conscience,_

face to face with the great and sf‘u-,

pendous, question before us ,’as re-
markably shown in the masterful pro-
duction of Rowland and Cliffordfs
play, “The Divorce.” .

This is a $2 attraction for popular
prices—one of the Lyceum’s best sur-

“' To the Editor of The Pitt Weekly:

l?ar Sir—-Probably you were at the
Car isle-Pitt game last Saturday. If
you were, you must have noticed
something which was and is a dis-
grace to our University. -
Some “White” people in the rooters’

section called out to players on the.

Carlisle team many insulting things.
Among them were: “We know you’ve
got a yellow streak—and, “Oh! you

“Redskins.” {As if the forefathers of a

Carlisle student were not as cleanly
andupright as were their town, who
were likely chased from cave to cave
or from tree to tree toiprovide sport
for their discoverers. And this at a
time when the Indians were to some

I degree civilized.

Other content.ed themselves with

, grunting in the approved story—book-

Indian fashion and reiterating “Heap

big chief!”

One fellow .I noticed is a graduate
of Pitt and a former member of the
football squad.

Now", this is mt a pleasant thing
to say, but it.looks as if there was a
very unwdesirabl ' lement in the stu-
dent body of, Pi .

Any one who has had sufficient» edu-
cation to enter the University. should
know better than to deride an oppo-
nent. If he does not, he should .at

least remember that he is now or has,

been a stud_ent at the University of
Pittsburgh, and that he is not at
home. 4 I ~

On the other hand, ‘I was delighted

to see that such g'ood feeling and

courtesy existed betweenathe teams:
An Indian would make a perfect
tackle, rolling our man over and
over, then ‘lie would‘get up, slap his
opponent on the shoulder .and help
him up. There is a specimen of the
“team with a yellow streak!”
Because one is a student and at a
football game, is no reason why one

The Editor coincides with ‘the
above and admonishes the students
to govern themselves in'the future in
such, a- way as will not reflect dis-

To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

‘Considerable enthusiasm has been
showniamonlg the students ofthe. den-
tal department to the forthcoming _of

Republicans were forced to organize
a separate party. .»

,“It is an historical fact that no
great reform ever came from within
a corrupt organization and the‘ pres-
ent politicalfsituation is a case in
point. During theapresent adminis-
tration Mr. Taft. has 'had ample op-
portunity to come out. on the side of
good politics,and Mr. Roosevelt has
not interfered in anyway, but he has.
failed.

“The calumny circulated by some
,of Col‘ Roosevelt's enemies, that he
is a hard drinker, is absolutely un-
true. It is only his temperance and
clean living that has enabled him to
survive the recent assault.

“The Progressive platform _is nota-
ble for the emphasis it lays upon leg-
islation for women and children.
Wom-en are taking their place in pub-
lic life as never before, and the Pro-
gressive party has been the ﬁrst tOn
recognize that tremendous fact.”

Dr. Callen”s speech was frequently‘
interrupted by ‘applause at the many
witty points which he made..

The second speaker was Mr. Thos.
D. McCloskey of the gAl,legheny
County Bar. He dealt withthis sub-
ject in the more technical mannergof
a lawyer, discussing primarily the re-
call of; judicial decisions. “He ex"-
ploded the idea that Mr. Roosevelt
is-_ in favor of the recall of judges, and
showed the wide “distinction between
these two issues, illustrating it by
four cases‘ unjustly decided by the
New York Supreme Court, ' '.

Mr. .McCloskey also spoke of the
subserviancev of the old line Repub‘-r
licans to the powerful and ‘corrupt
Mormon hierarchy. He said that four
states of the Union "are completely
under its control, and if for no other
reason, no decent citizen can con-
scientiously support the Republican
candidate in November. »

Owing to the inability of Mr. Ed-
ward Mercer, the intercollegiate Y.
M. C. A. worker, to «be present, no
Y. M. C. A. meeting was held at this

time. .

CAPT. GALVIN BADLY INJURED
“ 0 i I . __
After sixty minutes of gruelling

football, the Pitt eleven limped from

 

J the ﬁeld Saturday with a_ score of 45
i'to‘8 against them——the worse defeat

administered to a Gold and B1116
eleven since 1903. The score does not
show how good the game was by any;

‘ means as the Pitt players stopped the

Indian rushes when wit‘hin.a few feet
of theirgoal line andwhen they were
see-mingly ‘safe in the middle Of the
ﬁeld, Thorpe, Arcasa or Welsh would
tear around the end for 40 or 50 yards
and the score would grow blgger.
Many in-the .st_ands'were unable to
diagnose the end run formation that
allowed the Carlisle backﬁeld to skirt
the Pitt ends for such" long gains, so
an explanation -of the play will not
be out of place in this issue. Every
one marveled how Thorpe had seven

other Redskins'in front of him when

he ran around his own right" end, so
we will assume that Welsh has _just
given this signal. The Indian left end
goes over to the right end and the

~ quarter either stays behind the center

or goes to the right side, in which
case the ball is passed directly to
Thorpe. ‘The other players stay in
their respective positions. The in-
stant‘ the b'all,is passed, Thorpe starts
slowly toward the right end and the

‘interference, «which is composed of

thiejthree backs and two ends, forms
They
must necessarily form slowly as the
left guard and tackle must join ‘them
before they get up speed. i'Phi~'s“puts
just seven fast, husky Indians in front

"mof the runner, each one anxious to
‘hurl himself into a tackler wearing a
Gold and Blue jersey, and while Pitt'

broke up the play many‘ times, there
were seven times‘ when they failed to
"get _through, which accounts” for the
42 points piled up by the Aborigines.
The other three were scored by
Thorpe from the 45-yard line when
he pl.a-ced a kick between the up-
rights.’ . A A
V Pitt Scores Touchdown.

In_lthe third quarter things looked
dismal to’ the Gold and Blue rooters
for Thorpe, aided, by seven—man-inter-

 ference-end-run, had just scored .a

touchdown,-but -at; that point the

  

. .

 

 

players_took a‘ brace and rushed the
Redskins off their feet for the re-
mainder of the quarter. Galvin kicked
off to Thorpe after the latter had
made his touchdown, and Pratt
tackled him. The Indians we_1’e un-

able toegain in two tries at the line

and when Welsh essayed to gain_ on
an end run, Dillon tackled him so
ﬁercely that he dropped the biall,
which'Galvin recovered and carried
to the Indian 20-yard line. Wagner
tossed a forward pass to Dillon for a
5 yard gain, and then Pitt tried a
trick pass which completely fooled
the Redskins and scored the only
touchdown of the season against
them.’ Wagner ‘hurled the ball to
Galvin, who stood on the Indian goal

line, and Thorpe tackled him over the

line. Captain “Polly” received’a bad-
ly_ wrenched shoulder in this play
which will keep” him‘ out of the game
till Pitt plays_.Wi & ]., so our lone
touchdown was "rather -costly. Pitt
added two more pointsiwhen Galvin,
Smith and Leahy threw Thorpe back
of the Indian line. .

The three sensational features of
the game were the above mentioned
Indian interference, and the playing
of Thorpe and Wagner. A Pittsburgh
crowd ne\"er‘*before witnessed such
superb interference as theivisitoris ex-
hibited Saturday. A score or more of
times during the gamethe Indian car-
rying the ball would seem to have
absolutely no chance of'gain as a Pitt‘
tackler would be ‘just ready to ‘leave
his feet, when an interferer several

yards away would hurl his bulk at the

Gold and Blue player, "carrying him
many yards "from the funner. This
would happen time after time and
was enough to take the spirit out of
any team, but the whistle found the

Pitt players ﬁghtin/g even harder than

they had at ‘the start of thevcontest.
Capt. Thorpe of the'.Indian eleven

played a great gamefathalf back. He A

possesses every quality of a football
player, standing nearly six feet in

height andvweighing in the n-e:ighbor- 

hood of 180. In Stockholm Thorpe
won the decathlon and pentathlon
events,“ and"at ‘Celtic Park on Long
Island he won the all roundathletic
championship of the United States.
In this meet he Won the 100-yard

The ’Varsity will face the strong
Navy team next Saturday under" a—
great handicap as Capt- “Polly” Gal-
vin will be unable to play and Con-
nelly is also on the sick list. Galvin
received a badly wrenched shoulder
in the Indiarf game when iThorpe
tackled 'him over the line in‘ the third
quart'er. Coach' Thompson, seeing
that "his big center was injured, took
Hockensmith out of thehgame at once
thinking that Galvin would be unable
to ﬁnish and wishing to have his un-

vin ﬁnished the gamegalthough he
should‘ have been on the sidelines. He
will be out of thegame for several
weeks and may not be able to play in"

the W. & I game on November 16th. .

He is one of the mainstays of the
team and his loss will cause a general
shifting of the line. It is probable
that Coach Thompson will put Hock-
ensmith at center and use John Blair
at left tackle in “Dutch’s” place. \Con—

SPIRIT sHowN
- V AT THE INDIAN GAME

 

One of the most pleasing features
of the Pitt-Indian game was the
never—say—d~ie spirit that the Gold and
Blue crooters exhibited through ‘the
'entire contest. In the early game the‘
cheering was very poor, but when the

I team heeded backing they surely got

it. The two cheerleaders, Dick John-
son and Clyde Hazleft, were right on
the job all the time and were prob-
ably as tired as the players ‘when the
game was over. They both "say that
the spirit was great and that no urg-
ing was necessary to get such volume
into the many. yells.

Forbes Field Vvas well packed with
a crowd of over 9.000 and from many
remarks heard from strangers, ‘every-
one appreciated the great ﬁght put ’up

by the team andithe spirit showed by»

the cheering section. An Eastern man
said to the writer after the game,
“This is the ﬁrst Pitt game I have
ever seen and Iam mighty well
pleased with the exceptional spirit
shown by both yoursplayers and stu-
dents. Many teams would have quit
cold. after the ﬁrst half, but I believe
the Pittsburgh team was playing

jharder football in the fourth quarter

than at tire start of the game. Iihave

seen most of the important games. in

the East for the past ten years and
think that Pittsburgh compares...favor—
hbly with all the other large institu-
tions in spirit, Thevlndians certainly
look good to me and I think they will
win all the rest of their schedule with
ease. One never can tell about the

, I‘ Redmen, though, as they play like

mad one day and the next are all off
They played football to-day
‘which would have.beaten any team in
’th,e.countr_v, in my opinion.”

- SIDELINES

ll

Red Smith, Leahy, McEllroy and
I-Iockensmith came through the In-
dian gamefwithout a bump. '

Pitt’s ‘biggest player, Galvin, and
the smallest player, Connelly, were
both ‘badly injured.’ “Polly” Weighs
240 and Connelly just 100 less.

Corboy and Shof made several
pretty tackles Saturday.

Ray Collins received a. dislocated ‘

shoulder last week in practice.
“Raz” Quailey of last. year’s Varsity
is coaching the Martins Ferry High‘
School team. He expects to schedule
a game with the Pitt Freshmen. His

' team won by a score of 57-0 last ‘Sat-

urday, so the “wearers of the green”
had better get down ‘to practice.
_Quailey, Budd, Steve Dillon and Tex
Richards witnessed the Indian game
sidelines——too bad they
weren’tin -the lineup. A

_ “Auggie” Blair as the goat on the
‘Cornell trip last year and those who
make the trip_to Annapolis willpmiss
him. ' -

The only way to break up"t’heIn-

‘ 1 idian interference is‘ to throw a stick

_or"two of dynamiteat them asf they»

' go past.

and was so badly injured in the In-
dian°game that it is doubtful if {he
will be able‘ to ‘don -the moleskins
again this season. _

The Navy team has'almost as many
new men in their lineupthis year as
Pitt has, but will put up a great ﬁght
and with Pitt under such a‘ great
handicap should be able" to win. If
the Gold and Blue team displays such
spirit as they did las-t Saturday in the
Indian game they will be hard to beat-
and’ it is a safe bet that the game will
be. close and hard fought.

The team, accoinpanied by a large
delegation of rooters, left for Annap-

olis at’9:40 this morning on the Penn- A

sylvania and will spend the night at
Baltimore, The lineup will probably
betas follows: Center, Hockensmith;
guards, Smith and Leahy; tackles,
John Blair and Shapira; ends, McEl1-
roy,. Hoag, ‘Egbert or Blumenthal;
quarter, Ward or McEllroy;.halves,

"Dillon and’Shof or Corboy; fullback,

Wagner. Kernohan has showed class
all year and should get a chance in
to-'morrow’s game.

WONDERFUL INDIAN BACK-
FIELD DEFEATS PITTSBURGH

(Continued from Page 6)

doubtedly‘ the greatest player‘ in foot-
ball to‘-day, as he shines on bot -
fense and defense. He is a hard man
to tackle and is himself a vicious
tackler, If Thorpe is « injured this,
year, it is a good bet that the Indian
team will go to pieces, as Coach
Warner has built the team up around
their versatile captain.

A Wagner of Pitt‘ did as well‘ as
Thorpe last Saturday, as he punted a
triﬂe better, equaled Thorpe in tack-

.ball in the open ﬁeld. He would have
scored a touchdown from the kickoff
in,the third quarter, but had to slow
up in eluding Thorpe, the last tackler,
and was dropped from behind by

60 yards through the entire Indian
team was one of the features of‘ the
game. The center trio of the Pitt
team outclassed their red opponents
to such an extent that Welsh did not
try a single play through them after
the ﬁrstsquarter. Capt. Galvin stayed
in the game after being badly hurt
and deservesgmuch credit for his
pluck. Red Smith and Bill Leahy
played the entire game and their play-
ing made it impossible for the Red-
skins to gain through .P<itt’s line.
Shapira and Hockensmith ‘ played
most of the game at tackle, but
Reese and Pratt relieved them later
in the game. All four showed up well
and the ﬁrst three look particularly
good. Coach Thompson tried out
several ends, including Hoag, Joyce,
Blumenthal, Egbert and McEllroy.
The latter played the -best game.
Ward, McEllroy and Connelly played

. quarter, the latter being so -badly hurt

that ‘he will probably be out of the
game for several weeks.
Shoff, Corboy and Dillon held down

the backﬁeld positions. The lineup:
