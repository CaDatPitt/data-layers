Administration To Be Reorganize

SIG Events
Chairmen

Selected

By DAN BOOKER

In the ﬁnal meeting of the
term, Student Government (SG)
approved President Ralph Man-
ning’s nominations for chairmen
of Homecoming, Parents’ Week-
end, Liberal Arts Cabinet, and
Pharmacy ‘Cabinet. An emergen-
cy allocation to the Pitt Bowling
Club was also passed by the
Senate. '

Mike Weingarten, liberal arts
junior, was selected 1966 Home-
coming chairman. Weingarten
has served as co-chairman of Pitt
Preview and is vice-president of

 Sigma Alpha Mu social frater-

nity.
Chairman of Parents’ Weekend

. will be junior Linda Davis, presi-

dent of Sigma Delta Tau sorority
and past publicity chairman of
Parents’ Weekend. »
Liberal Arts Cabinet and Pha
macy Cabinet will be headed by
Tom Sachs and Judy Kunsman,
respectively. Sachs is sports edi-
tor of The Pitt News and has
been co-chairman or the Book
Exchange. Miss Kunsman is a
member of the editorial board of
The Pitt Capsule. _ '
Serving with Miss Kunsman on

the Pharmacy Cabinet will be 1

Mike Ciampaglione, as junior
representative; Carol Wilson, sen-
ior representative; and Judy Ni-
ccolai, SG representative.

The Bowling Club allocation,

’ amounting to $250, came from

the treasury of the Liberal Arts
Cabinet and allowed the bowlers
to travel to Chicago to compete
in the National Collegiate Ath-

letic Association,’s bowling cham-;

pionships.

Senator Lois Kane, a member
of the Liberal Arts Cabinet,‘ ex-
pressed fears that the allocation

‘would set a precedent whereby

organizations needing emergency
funds could expect to get these
monies from other organizations.
The Senate felt, however, that

this was a special case and that‘

the Student Activities Fee would
cover any such cases in the fu-
ture.

In a last order of business,
Senator Abe Singer announced
that a University chapter of the

A, Collegiate Council for the United

Nations and the Pitt Mental
Health Board have been recogi-
zed by the University Recogni-
tions Committee.

Committee 6 Decides»  e I a

Senior  of ’66  Cutfits  
Library Student Lounge

The Class Committee of 1966
unanimously decided to outﬁt ..a
student lounge in the new Hill-
man Library as a class gift. The
selection of a student lounge was
made over other proposals be-
cause it would be a lasting con-

tribution to be used by all future"

University undergraduates, ac-
cording to Jim Smith, class pres-
ident.

A Class Fund will be set up as

a regular University account by.
‘the Class Committee. As such, it

will be controlled by alumni of
the Class of 1966 and held sep-
arate from the Alumni Giving
Fund Account. Contributions to
this fund will be put toward the
class gift, _a brunch before grad-
uation, a class directory, reunions
and special projects for the fu-
ture.

Graduation information will be

"mailed out to all graduating sen-

iors in May. The information will
include the procedure for acquir-
ing a cap and gown, for obtain-
ing the refund from the matricu-
lation fee paid as _a prospective
freshman, and for contributing
toward the class gift. '
Thirtydollars of the $50 matri-
culation goes toward graduation
expenses and $20 is refunded to
the student when he graduates.
According to Smith, the Class
Committee “hopes that when sen-

Smith pointed out that a grad-

Although we hope every graduat-
ing~ senior will contribute $10 to-
ward the class gift, smaller con-
tributions, will be welcome.”

Richard Bruni will begin work
on the class directory immedi-
ately after the end of the winter
trimester. He hopes to have it
completed before June.

Barbara Stevenson is planning
the br_unch to be held in the ear-
ly afternoon before commence-
ment June 6. The ceremonies will
be held outside on the Cathedral

tained as of yet.

5 Vice - Chancellors
, To Be Eliminated  

. The University plans to recognize its top administration V
and reduce the number of vice-chancellors from eight to .t
three. The details of the plan, which is in line with sugges-
tions advanced by_a recent Ford Foundation study, Were-
announced by Acting Chancellor David H. Kurtzman.

Under the revised set-up, the three vice-chancel1or’s

for the Academic Disciplines, the
Professions and Finance.

“It is our hope,” said Dr. Kurtz-
man, (“to simplify and stream-
line the administration of the
University, taking advantage of a
number of vacancies in adminis-
trative positions. The plan will
provide a new chancellor, when
he is appointed with an organiza-
tion that will give him the great-

est ﬂexibility for either future

building or restructuring.”

' The plan will go into effect

May 1,

In addition to the aforemen-
tioned three, the vice-chancellors’
offices at the University include

Planning and General Affairs, the

Health Professions, Student Af-
fairs, Regional Programs, and De-
velopment. For several years,
however, the Vice-Chancellor for
Planning and General Affairs also
has served as the Acting Vice-

Char_1_cel1or for’ the Health Pro-

fessions. *

Three of the administrators
currently holding the title are
planning’ to take_ other posts.
They are: Edison Montgomery,
vice-chancellor for planning and
general affairs and acting vice-
chancellor for the health profes-

sions, who has recently been,

association of 32 leading Ameri-
can universities orgainzed to fos-
ter greater cooperation and shar-
ing in library and information
facilities, particularly t h r o u gh

techniques of modern high-speed.

communication and computers.
Beginning. in June, Montgom-

ery will devote most of his time’

to his new position, but will re-

main with the University until a‘

new chancellor is appointed. He
will serve as a part-time assis-
tant to the ‘chancellor for plan-
ning.

As such, he will continue to be‘

responsible for planning, institu-
tional research, the Knowledge

Dr. Rudner sorted out three
-categories of views on the role of
‘evaluational factors in the ac-
ceptance or rejection of scienti-
A‘ ﬁc hypotheses. The ﬁrst category
. included those philosophers who
. believe scientists as scientists
‘ should not accept or reject hypo-
theses at all. Rudolf Carnap and
Carl G. Hempel are among the
holders of this view. Carnap
claims that codiﬁed rules of in-
duction considered as ultimate
rules for inductive reasoning are
’necessarily inadequate. We can-
not devise such a set of rules
which will'always give us a pre-
 scription for rational action. The
"task of the scientist is merely to
determine degrees of probabil-
.ities of hypotheses. Dr. Rudner
-..claims these are very weak argu-
jnients for such a position, since
. this would remove scientists from
-"the task of inductive inference.
1- "Dr. Rudner next explained Hem-
pel’s attempt to give some kind
of quantitative measure of “pure
scientiﬁc utility.” Hempel him-
self admitted that the problem
was immensely difficult, and that
he had not solved it."

The second main classiﬁcation
of views is that of Ernest Nagel
- and Isaac Levi. This view holds
that scientists do accept and re-
— ject hypotheses but that evalua-
 tional factors are" not involved
 in the decision.

Levi believes that the objec-

Aired by Lecturer

By JOSEPH A. DIVACK

-. Dr. Richard S. Rudner, chairman of the department of
philosophy at Washington University, delivered the ﬁnal
Philosophy of Science lecture of this trimester Wednesday
night. The title of his lecture was “Formal and Evaluational
, Factors in.the Logic of Induction,” but the speaker limited
-"himself to the evaluational factors only. A

1,.‘ —-A

tive of pure science is “to ﬁnd
the truth and_ nothing but the
truth.” He argues against Dr.
Rudner’s behavioral analysis of
scientiﬁc assessments. Professor
Rudner set forth arguments to
show that Levi’s position is in-
consistent, and that a non-beha-
vioral analysis of statistical in-
ference is implausible.

The third category of philoso-
phical positions is the one which
Dr. Rudner himself espouses.
This states simply that scientists
should accept or reject hypo-

theses, and that evaluational fac-

tors are involved. Such factors
might be the seriousness of error
involved in such acceptance or
rejection.

In summary, Professor Rudner

showed why a simpliﬁed view of

scientiﬁc methodology (the view
of Carnap and Hempel) which
takes account only of the usual
evidential base leaves out impor-
tant . extra-scientiﬁc evaluational
factors. The Carnap-Hempel
school certainly would have a
hard time giving an account of
who should accept or reject hypo-
theses, if in fact the scientist as
scientist should not make the de-
cision.

The next lecture in this series
will be on May 9, when Dr. Mor-
ton Beckner will speak on “Non-
deductive Logic.” A

In 38 years, the Johnstown
campus of the University has
enrolled over 15,000 full and
part-time students. Of these,
725 are presently enrolled-a
substantial increase over the
301 enrollment of 1958.

The Johnstown division was
established in 1927 and was
the first of the regional cam-
puses. A new $7.5 million cam- '
pus, including ten buildings, is
under construction and is sched- '

- uled for completion "in Sep-
tember, 1967.

ST om Cikoski:

The Paper

The usual end-of-trimester panic has fallen over the
campus as students frantically try to complete assignments
they were given months ago. The biggest part of this panic
involves papers’ which the student has only the vaguest idea
about starting.

Yet the real tragedy is not that the student is behind
in his work and at the mercy of stark terror, but that so
many students do not realize that with a
few simple time-tested rules papers can be
written in almost no time with little effort
enabling the student to pass or even im-
prove his grade!. _‘ .

INSTRUCTORS, especially grad student
graders, read and grade a tremendous num-
ber of papers each term when they would
much rather be out drinking. Thus the real
trick to quickie paper writing is in making
_ - the greatest impression with the least
actual content.

paper is an impressive title. Suppose you are to write on
coal mining in France. Would you title your paper “Coal
Mining in France?” Never! You would name it “The French
Art of Stripping.” The instructor will immediately know
you are a knowledgeable chap and grade you higher for it.
A few provocative illustrations of shale strata will help

The next rule is to footnote extensively. The footnotes
need not have any relevance to the material and in fact may
be quite imaginary. For instance the statement “Gladstone
, and Disraeli were often at odds” might be footnoted “see

.Wijanski, pp. 357.” Needless to say Wijanski is your milk-
man. The instructor never checks these things.

FINALLY IT IS always good practice to write in as
humorous a style. as possible-. This gives the impression that
you are so familiar with the material that you are parody-
ing it. In this manner you may improvise with impunity
around the barest framework of fact and get away with it.
An English theme could be padded endlesslywith such
statements as “Thoreau was an alcoholic who spent a great
deal of time tippling at The Walden with Liza Browning,
Walt Wh1tman’s broad.” .

,_ Such easy conﬁdence with history impresses even the
 most hard-bitten reader.

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS .

The University has taken a necessary step forward by reorganizing
‘its top-level administrative structure. The reduction of the number of
vice-chancellors from seven to three is an economical and reasonable move.

Earlier in the year the Ford Foundation Report on the state of the
University advised that a simpler structure would ease communication and

The report pinpointed criticism that had been leveled at the Uni-
versity for the past several years. It seemed unnecessary to have the
Deans report to a vice.-chancellor when at most universities they report

The new University structure will follow this trend. The Director of
the University libraries, the deans of the schools in the Health PI"0feSS10IlS,
and the Dean of Student Affairs will now report directly to the Chancellor.
This will inevitably simplify administrative communications.

A minimal

With this in mind, the ﬁrst requisite of a good quickie’

 

       Editorial: Reorganization and

ment is . ..

At the same time the new reorganization continues to relieve the

the Future
Chancellor of the burden of having all the top administrators reportto
him. Much of the responsibility for top-level leadership rests in the hands
of three time-tested University administrators: Dr. David Kurtzman, Dr.
Charles Peake and Dr. A. C. Van Dusen. All have shown themselves to be
able administrators, capable of coping with their increase duties.

Some may argue that this is a reform which should have been insti-
tuted years ago. They will point tothe Ford Report and say that such
reorganization might have prevented the University’s ﬁnancial crisis.

But as the Ford Report itself advised: “Neither the public nor the
University will be served.by the exercise of hindsight . . . Of greater mo-
a series of bold and effective steps taken toward recovery.”
All the members of the University community should accept this change,
not with bickering and accusations of blame. As with all the changes we
face in the next few months, we should instead look toward the future
growth of the University and cease to wrestle with the past.

  Letters to the Editor

e Art Editor Resigns

From Magazine
Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to state my formal
resignation at art director of Ideas
and Figures.

I have recently come to the
startling conclusion that the man-
uscript of the new’ magazine, to
be published in September has
been assembled to the ignorance,
if not deliberate exclusion of the
majority of the Ideas and Figures
staff. Staff meetings were discon-
tinued in November 1965.

I personally learned that the
only way to ‘receive any sort of
information about the
magazine was to directly corner
the editor. This method enabled
me to conclude, though rather
vaguely, that a new magazine was
being planned.

. I was told by the editor, “yes

.we are going to have a maga-

zine, get some art work togeth-
er.” I was. however, unable to
decipher whether there was any
sort of deﬁnite deadline; or
whether’ we had begun to make
bids to printers. This went on for
several months.

March 24 I heard the secretary
of Ideas and Figures announcing
to someone that the magazine had
already been assembled by the
editor, except for some short
stories and art work. I also heard
that bids had been sent to the
various printers. In speaking per-
sonally to the secretary, she ad-
vised me to bring in around 20
pieces of art work that I liked
(there would be room in the ma-
gazine for about 6 pieces).

I then asked her when we could
be expected to begin the lay-out
for the magazine _(1ay-out being
one of the chief functions of the
art editor, presumably)’. She re-
plied, “sometime in the summer.”
I then expressed concern over the
fact that I would not be in Pitts-
burgh in the summer, and I was
told not to’ worry about that, it
would be taken care of.

At that point I" realized that
either deliberately or through a
kind of indifference, my function
as art editor had been usurped.
I then spoke with several other
staff members and I realized that
they too had been unaware that
a magazine had been assembled
It was then that I decided to re-
sign from my positioh. My job
had been taken out of my hands,
and putting my name in the ma-
gazine would be absurd; and I
wanted to bring into open the
facts about how the magazine had
been run this year, in a hope that
in following years, an entire staff
would be included in the making
of a magazine. ,

Errant Photographer

Explains Trot _
Concerning the letter to the

editor in the March 30 issueof.

The Pitt News, I am the “errant
photographer who wandered in.
toward the middle of Mozart’s
‘Quartet in G Major’ ” and who,
after "taking two pictures, “trotted
out.” Not knowing the exact
meaning of‘ “errant” and ‘thinking
that “trotting” applied only to
horses, I decided to look these
words up in the dictionary. They
were deﬁned as follows: errant-
traveling in search of adventure;
trotting-going at a gate between
a walk a_ind a run by lifting the.

‘right forefoot and the left hind-

foot at aboutthe same time.

In otherwords, on the night of

March 24, I could be seen going .

around. campus ‘lifting my right
forefoot and left hindfoot at about
the same time traveling in search
of adventure’.

To clarify a point, I am an Owl

photographer. When I receive an
assignment such as a concert or
lecture, I try to remain for the
entire event and disturb things
as little as possible. But that par-
ticular night, I was printing pic-
tures for an Owl deadline and
was forced to take the ‘picture
and leave. I had to stand on the
chair to get a good View for the
picture and I would have done
so even if I had remained for the
entire event.

But your letter brings up an im-
portant point. Many people have
complained about photographers
inadvertently disrupting an event
by taking pictures ‘and leaving.
Consider the facts: the Owl has
three photographers and The Pitt
News only two—a small number
for the hundreds of pictures that
appear in the Owl and Pitt News
every year. Since we can't be
everywhere at once and many

times have a few assignments in.

one night, it is often necessary to
shoot and run.

PPP Chairman
Asks ’MDC To Act

Editor, The Pitt News:

The proceedings of the Tower’s
Quadrangle Committee as re-
gards the distribution of litera-
ture in the men’s dormitories
were ended on March 15. The
result was the liberalization of

the rules in the Tower’s lobby,

and a strong recommendation to
the Dean of Student Affairs to
advise the Men’s Dorm Council
(MDC) to radically liberalize its

  

rules above the second ﬂoor. In 

the spirit of co-operation, the
Pitt Progressive Party (PPP)
made a proposal that was pub-
lished in The Pitt’News on March
14. The proposal also received
editorial support.

Almost three weeks have pass-
ed since then. Despite constant
requests, the IVIDC has not even
bothered to discuss the proposal.
Their attitude shows a total lack
of concern. ‘The PPP hopes that
the existence of the rules and
the said proposal shall be review-
ed and acted upon at least dur-
ing the spring term.

F Sergeant Describes
  Green Beret Forces

{adio reports mention "action in Vietnam involving
“Green Berets.” Headlines in newspapers often scream out
that same phrase. One of the nation’s top tunes is entitled
the “Ballad of the Green Beret.” The phrase is now heard
in everyday conversation-and is invariably accompanied by

.<§'5.'

a vague aura of respect.

Despite all this, the nature of
the Special Forces, which is the
official title of the “Green Ber-
ets,” remains a mystery to many
people. There is one man on cam-
pus who could clear up this
mystery — Sergeant First Class
Edwin Sheridan. Sgt. Sheridan
was a member of the Special
Forces and is currently attached
to the University’s Army ROTC
detachment. ’ V

Sheridan emphasized that the
basic mission of the Special Forces
is to train men. This does not
sound very-glamourous compared
to what one usually hears about
the “Green Berets.” But, the Ser-
geant went on to explain, very
often part of the training in-
volves actual combat" situations.

While stationed in Vietnam,
prior to 1962, Sheridan saw Viet-
niamese come to Da Nang to re-
ceive combat training in the class-
room. When this was completed,
they went out for ﬁeld exercises,
only to ﬁnd the Viet Cong wait-
ing for them. Special forces team
members accompanied the
traine.es on these trips.

Likewise, a Special Forces team‘

may go into a village or hamlet
in Vietnam to teach villagers to
defend their homes and meet
with overt enemy opposition
throughout the training period.-
It has been action in this un-_

der-ﬁre training that has distin-

guished the Special Forces in re-
cent years.

officers. The other ten men are
divided into subteams containing
two men. Each subteam is highly
trainedin a special area, though
any man on the team can per-
form in any of these areas. Both
members of the medic subteam
are "qualiﬁed to perform minor
operations, as well as the usual
ﬁrst aid needed on the battle-
ﬁeld. .

The weapons subteam and the
radio operators are also highly
qualiﬁed in their respective areas.
Sheridan’s own area is opera-
tions and intelligence. This team
is mainly responsible for show-
ing trainees how to get men and
supplies-~in-to an area, how to
keep suppl_ies flowing, and how

.to maintain an ‘intelligence net.

Demolitions is the speciality of

the last team. These explosives‘

experts have what Sgt. Sheridan
called the “hardest job.” They
must know how to do a job with
four ounces of explosiveithat-an
ordinary demolitions man would
need a pound to do.

The Special Forces program
was initiated in 1952, but did not
receive attention until 1961, when
it was greatly expanded by the
lat-e President Kennedy.

To become a “Green Beret,” a
soldier must complete paratroop
training and then volunteer for
the Special Forces. If selected, he
will undergo training at the Spe-
cial Forces center at Fort~Bragg,
North Carolina, or in special
areas overseas. '

 Medical Students Win

  National Recognition

Two students of the Universi-
ty’s School of Medicine have won
national recognition for reports
on research which they conduct-
ed this "past summer at the Uni-
versity. They are: sophomore
Thomas Gessner and freshman
Michael Davidson.

The students submitted papers
to the annual SAMA-Mead John-
son Scientiﬁc Forum of the Stu-
dent American Medical Associa-
tion, which awarded cash prizes
to the ten best papers received.

Gessner’s paper, “The Localiza-
tion of TSH in the Nuclear Frac-
ticn of Thyroid Cells” and David-
son’s “The Clearancenof Exogen-
ous Citric‘Acid by the Isolated
Perfused Calf Liver” both re-
ceived honorable mention.

The students participated in
the University’s Summer Re-

search Program. Supported pri-,

marily by a grant from the Na;
tional Institutes of Health, the
program offers students an oppor-

tunity for personal investigation,
under faculty sponsorship, of
clinical or basic science problems.
Each student engaged in summer
research receives a $750 stipend.

Cites Progress

The University of Pitts-
burgh at Johnstown next
year will observe the 40th
anniversary of its establish-
ment as a regional campus
of the Oakland university.

The past four decades
have been marked by steady
growth, both in enrollment
and in academic achieve-
ment.

But however proud of its
past, the University of -Pittsburgh
at J ohnstown is looking anywhere
but back! C

At the present time, the re-
gional campus at Johnstown is
embarked on one of the most am-
bitious building programs ever un
dertaken by a comparable insti-
tution of learning--construction of
a complete, new campus in the
Richland Township section of
Cambria, some ﬁve miles from
its present site. '

Following successful completion
of a _$138 million public fund
campaign, the college officially
launched its long-range building
program last December with tra-
ditional ground-breaking c e r e-
monies.

Phase One of the project, in-
volving 10 buildings and an es-
timated cost of $7.6 million, is
slated for completion and occu-
pancy in late summer of 1967.

And that is only the beginning.
Several more phases are on the
drawing board. When completed,
the multi-million dollar campus
community will offer complete
academic, athletic, recreational
and housing facilities second to

Johnstown

Johnstown Campus Schedules
  Ten New Buildings For Campus

Johnstown College of the Uni-
versity is nowuin the process of
acquiring ten new buildings on

its campus in Richland County. 7

Contracts were awarded at the
end of last year for the ﬁrst
phase’ of the college’s $7.6 mil-
lion building program. The new
buildings, which will be ready in
September, 1967, include six aca-
demic buildings,» three dormi-
tories, and a student union-physi-
cal education building.

The contract for the general
construction of _ the academic
buildings was awarded to Berke-
bile Brothers of Johnstown at a

‘cost of just under two million

dollars. The academic structures,
designated North and South Halls,

consist of two complexes of three
buildings each.

The remaining buildings are
being built by L-D Building Co.
of Latrobe for oyer two million
dollars. Contracts for heating,
plumbing, and electrical wiring
bring the total to about 6.2 mil.-
lion. Later work for landscaping,
playing ﬁelds, and athletic facil-
ities will hike the total to at
least $7.6 million.

Dr. T. W. Biddle, college presi-
dent, speaking on behalf of the
College Advisory Board, said, “we

are very happy to get the project‘

in motion and we are especially

pleased to be able to award so.

much of this workvto local con-
tractors.
“The entire project has been

made possible because people in
the Greater J ohnstown Area have
contributed the initial $1,380,000
With that amount as a founda-
tion we were ‘able to make sound
requests of the federal govern-

«ment for grants and loans to

make thetotal $7.6 million proj-
ect possible,” he said. ’

Dr. Biddle said that this initial
project in the new campus devel-
opment is the ﬁrst of a four or
ﬁve-phase development program
scheduled for completion within
the next -25-30 years.

Dr. Biddle said, “where as we,
are now able to accommodate 700
full-time students, the facilities
under construction will enable
us to accommodate more than
1,000 students. _ -

tral High School. Ten years‘
earlier evening courses had been
offered on a limited basis, and in, _
1923, a branch summer session
had been held. .

The late Dr. Stanton C. Craw- ”
ford served as the Johnstown di- 6
vision’s ﬁrst director. 

The college, then known vari-
ously as Johnstown Center or
Junior Pitt, moved into its pres-, ‘’
ent quarters, a converted and en-
larged public school building on
Cypress Avenue in the Moxham _
section of the city, in 1946 at the ’
height of the post-World War Two
enrollment boom.

Steady growth led to expansion
of facilities each year, and in .-
1958 the University of Pittsburgh,-
at Johnstown had its ﬁrst presi-
dent and dean.

It was in 1962 that ﬁrst public »
announcement of the proposed
new c a m p u s building program
was made by then chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld. _

Full-time enrollment in 1965 was ‘
725, including students from the
immediate area as well as many
from neighboring states.

By way ‘of comparison, enroll-

years later it was 361, and in 1962 7
it had climbed to 6l0.'Net included

dents. _

Evening courses annually at-,
tract many adults who are com-
bining college education with reg-
ular employment. Student nurses
from Conemaugh Valley Memori-
al Hospital in J ohnstown also use
the University of Pittsburgh at
J ohnstown educational facilities. 

During the past 38 years, more
than 15,000 full-time and part-
time students have studied here,
with nearly 6,000 of these eventual-
ly receiving University of Pitts"-
burgh degrees. - , pf ,

Proud of its distinction as the '
ﬁrst University of Pittsburgh re-
gional campus established in‘:
Western Pennsylvania, the Johns- .
town college is equally proud of.
its record and conﬁdent of its 1
future. , -

The_University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown operates with an ad-‘ “
ministrative staff and faculty
which numbers’ nearly 50 per;
sons, many of whom have gained 2
recognition in their chosen aca-
demic ﬁelds. ' 

Dr. Theodore W. Biddle now is ,
in his eighth year as president»
of the regional college.’ Serving ’
with him are Col. George Gage, ‘
assistant and Dr. Paul R. Walter, .
dean. ”‘

To accommodate out-of-a r e a
students, the college maintains a.
dormitory -— Fort Stanwix Dormi-
tory Johnstown. The dormitory, a
former hotel building, house ap-C _
proximately 240 students.

The dormitory also provides fa-

Schmitt Discusses

‘Disheartening’ Fiction

As one of the contributing speak-
ers at Friday’s 21 Annual Writ-
er's Conference held in Stephen
Foster Memorial Hall, Gladys
Schmitt, professor of English at
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
discussed the “disheartening”
condition of ﬁction today, and
possible solutions to the problem.

In her talk, entitled, “The Di-
lemma of the Contemporary Fic-
tion Writer,” Miss Schmitt quoted
Lional Trilling as saying that ﬁc-
tion will improve when writers
“deal in very explicitways with
ideas.” She noted, however, that
many contemporary authors are
quite concerned with ideas, but

i , Merritt
~ Leaves ,
University L
Dr. James Merritt, associate
professor of English at the Uni-

versity, will teach at Brooklyn
College next year.

Dr. Merritt said that his Uni!

versity position was his ﬁrst
teaching experience. His three
year contract expired this year
and “There are only three cities
that would attract me,” Dr. Mer-

-ritt said. Considering moving to

New York, his native Boston or
Chicago, ‘Brooklyn College made
the best offer.

Dr. Merritt believes that “the
University _ of Pittsburgh's great
day is about to bloom.” He attri-
butes this belief to the future
state-relatedness of the Universi-
ty and the fact that “the days of

‘the private college are number-

ed.”

these ideas are of little intellec-
tual value.

“Their high priest is Genet,”
said Miss Schmitt, “who has
placed his literary powers in the
service of an elaborate mystique
by which the only true values
can be found in acts which are
morally and physically disgust-
ing.” " p .
Perversity and violence are‘ pop-
ular, but as Miss Schmitt also
noted most people’s lives never
touch the situations which are
topics for popular novels today.
“Would it seem then that the
writer of ﬁction should draw his
material from the area of our
personal relationships, love, riv
alry, hate.” '

“All the formal elements of the
novel have been experimented
with by 1940,” said Miss Schmitt,
“and all our current" experimen-
talists . . . seem not to be add-
ing new elements but rather
stripping away the old ones.”

In the midst of so much liter-
ary debris, Miss "Schmitt cites
Henry James as one author who
has maintained Popularity With
works of lasting signiﬁcance. He
has accomplished this by look-
ing directly at "life, keeping the
philosophy, “ﬁction is felt life.”
As such, he and writers like him,
do not strive for intellectualism
for" its own sake, but try to
“catch hold of life,” and reveal
it to the reader. V - '

Miss Schmitt was one of six
writers speaking at the Confer-
ence designed to give advice to
young writers. Other people on
the program included Robert Al-
berts, vice-president of Ketchum,
MacLeod, and Grove; Dennis Ca-
sey, University undergraduate;
Dr. Abe Laufe, associate profes-
sor of English at the University;

Tere Rios, book‘ and short-story,

tant professor, of English. at Alle-

Men’s Council Sponsors Talk

By ALAN DISLER-

Two representatives ‘of the
Pennsylvania State Selective Serv-
ice System spoke to about 350
male students last Wednesday in
the private dining room of Tow-.
er A‘ cafeteria. The program was‘
sponsored by Men’s Council.

and Lt. Colonel John B. Hetzel
told the audience that in order
to remain out of the desirable
draft range, freshman must be
in the upper half of their class,
sophomores in the upper two-
thirds, juniors in the upper threel
fourths, and seniors planning to
go on to graduate school in the
upper fourth.

the number of full-time male stu-
dents in each school or division
of a college. .
An alternative to those not in
the desirable academic range will
‘be adeferment test administered

- by the Science’ Research Associ-

ates of Chicago at -numerous

places across the country. Under-

graduates must score 70 or better
‘ on the test (out of a possible 100)
and graduate students must score
- 80 or better.

The test will be given May 14
and 21 and June 3. Students can
register for the test at any local
selective service board, regard-
less of the boards they are regis-
tered with. The test can be taken
more than once, but the lowest
score will count in any event.
Plans call for the test to be ad-
ministered every Spring.

It was explained that students
who drop out of school for more
than a term will be subject to the
draft. Those entering graduate
school must enter the next class
commencing. Also, it is expected
that an undergraduate will com-
.plete his studies in four years,
and those requiring more are sub-

ject" ' to ~ induction’

Lt. Colonel William C. Grimm.

Class rankings are based on.

Draft Status Explained

College students are expected
to inform their respective local
boards as to their status on their
own initiative. Deferments will
be jeopardized when such infor-
mation is not available.

Another Day  

by Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

‘ Leo Bemis is a struggling man. For four years he has
[been racing through the corridors of the Athletic Depart-
‘ment in a manner reminiscent of Sherman’s march through
»jGeorgia, praising the sport of bowling. No one has listened
"to him yet. '

Bemis, who is more widely known as the soccer coach
there, is on the board of directors of the National Intercol-
legiate Bowling Association. Four years ago he called to-
gether the top bowlers in the University and asked them
‘if they wanted to form a team. ‘

As regional director of Western Pennsylvania bowling,
she next set about organizing some competition for his Pitt
"bowlers. There are now nine teams representing the small
:colleges in the area in the West Penn League. At first most
.of the matches were conducted through the mail. This year
Bemis will proudly tell you that 75% of the. matches were‘
 bowled face-to-face.

‘ For all his success at organizing, Bemis is ‘still con-
fronted with one major setback. His bowling team has
never been officially recognized by the University as a team.
3They now have the title of the Pitt bowling club.

Their dubious title has never ceased to be a source of
“ embarrassment to the bowlers. It has also been a ﬁnancial
rhandicap. What has happned to the bowlers this past year
, provides as good an illustration as any. ‘

- The bowlers finished up their season with a 26-7 record.

"They also won the regional roll-off with Clarion and St. V1n- -

cent last week. Their performance earned them an invita-
tion to the NIBA championships this past weekend in C-hi-
pcago.
1 Two days before they were scheduled to leave the bowl-
«ers we1'e scampering about the campus, begging for money
for the trip.

The West Penn League pitched in 100 dollars to the
cause. The Dean of Mens’ office graciously consented to give
-them 25 dollars. Any experienced traveler will tell you that
‘it is hard for 125 dollars to cover seven round trip airline
tickets to Chicago, a one night stay in a motel, and also
__expenses.

Since they weren't officiallya team, the bowlers found"
fthe Atheltic Department to be about as generous as Uncle
Scrooge. It was now Wednesday night and the bowlers were
really desperate. They took their plea to the Student Gov-
ernment meeting and ng one was more surprised than the
“Student Government.
I When they realized they were dealing with a club and not
‘a team, the still-puzzled senators granted the bowlers a
(25 dollar e-mergency allocation. The bowlers ﬁnally made
their trip to the Nationals, where they came in ﬁfth.
‘ “I don’t see why they won’t call us a team,” says Ron
‘Smith, who is the captain of the club. “We represent Pitt
"better than most of the other teams and we represent Pitt
«the way it should be represented. But we’re always told
.we'11 have to be content just being a club.”

This year should mark the end of the bowlers’ obscur-
,.1ty. Whether they become a team or not, they have at least
‘ ained-recognition for themselves. And with Bemis as a
lobbyist they might eventually replace basketball as the
.-is i*Winter’s leading sport.

 

Baseball Team Readies

For Bucknell Opener

By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Five days remain before the baseball team takes the
ﬁeld against Bucknell in the season opener. Coach Bobby
Lewis has brought the team along, trimming it down to 24
ballplayers, right where he wants to be for Saturday’s game

at Leech Farm and the for the
first few weeks of the campaign.

“For most of the year, the
squad will be 22 players,” Lewis
said. “But right now we’re carry-
ing eight pitchers and after our
Southern trip we’ll go to six.”

Lewis needs eight pitchers for
the swing South where the base-
ball team plays five games in
five days. After those contests in
Norkfolk and ‘Richmond, Va., and
Washintgon,‘ D. C., Lewis hopes
to determine who his reliable
pitchers are so he can set up a
three or four man starting ro-
tation.

As it appears now, Paul Helsel
and Don Stock, both (righthand-
ers, and Dave Welty, a southpaw,
will hurl against Bucknell. “Hope-
fully th-ey’ll pitch three innings
apiece,” Lewis said. “None of

them has gotten enough work”

yet to go any further than that.”

In the bullpen, Lewis has Bob
Schields as his only lefty. Mark
Zovko, Jim Clister, Tom Sabo
and Rich Orsneck comprise the
rest of the relievers.

The starting catcher will be
Randy Vallentine. Guy Busci and-
Jim Daniels provide_ the depth
behind the plate. The
seems set with Chris Mitchell
starting at ﬁrst, co-captain Steve
Eiseman at second, Steve Kienzl
at shortstop, and Tom Beckett
handling third. '

Tom Smith is the alternate
first baseman and John Adams,
Rich Mack," and Dave.TDorst give
ample inﬁeld reserve strength.

Platooning seems to be what
coach Lewis has in mind for his.
outﬁelders. Co-captain Ferd Sauer
will play against both right and
lefthanded pitching in centerﬁeld.
If Warren Sordill’s knee keeps
responding the way it has after
his recent operation, he would
be a regular due to his ability as
a switch hitter.

Phil Masrallah will play the
outﬁeld against lefthand pitching
and George MacKenzie will do
the same against righthanders. If
Sordill’s knee doesn’t hold up,
Lewis has lefty hitter Welty to
roam in the outﬁeld on days
when he’s not on the mound. And

Shidemantle Places Fourth

The gymnastics season has ﬁn-
ally drawn to a close and for
sophomore Dave Shidemantle it
has been a satisfying season. The
long horse expert placed fourth
in his specialty at the Nationals
Saturday night at Penn State.

His 9.25 vault was a long way
behind the winning vault of 9.8
recorded by Frank Schmidt of
Southern Illinois, but Shideman-
tle was also the only representa-
tive from the East to qualify for
the long horse ﬁnals. Shideman-

One of the reasons for the golf

past has been lack of enough

Coach Ben Pope is as optimis-
tic as possible about the chances
of his tennis team this spring.
The only trouble is he doesn’t
have any outstanding players.
“This is not a winning team,”
said Pope, “but the boys do try.”

“The boys” include Marty Lei-
bowitz and Eric Lieberman, the
team’s number one and two play-
ers, respectively. Graduation
claimed Pope‘s two top athletes
of last season, but the coach has
high hopes for sophomore Bill
Nichols.

Pope stresses, above all else,
the enthusiasm of these three top
players and of all the others on
his squad but he is also aware of
the tough competition they will
face.

The team’s ﬁrst meet is on
April 9 against Bucknell. Al-
though Pope’s men lost, 9-0, to
Bucknell last Spring, he, “Would-
n’t be surprise if we won a match
from this year.”

Depth Chart Established

Injuries, Limited Schedule Hamper
Hart During Spring Football Drills

-By GEORGE LIES

Amid a growing number
of injuries and squeezed-in
practices, head coach Dave
Hart continues the renovation of
Panther football during Spring
drills.

Weather conditions and late
classes have hindered Hart and
his staﬁ since practice began two
weeks ago, but the most pressing
point thus far is the increasing
casualty list. '

“Five or six players came up
with knee injuries,” Hart said.
“And this is very unusual for
Spring practice. The weather may
have something to do with it, but
if they are going to get hurt, it’s
better that they get hurt now
and not in the Fall.

“The doctors told (sophomore
quarterback Bob Mader that he
counld never play football again
due to a. heart murmur,” Hart
said. With another soph, Dave
Montrella, out with a dislocated
shoulder, Hart is left with just
four candidates ’ for the. signal
calling position. They are Ed
James, Mike Elliot, Bob Bazylak,
and Tippy Pohl. ,

After viewing ﬁlms of last
Wednesday’s scrimmage, Hart and
made evaluations of each player.
Using their reports, Hart com-
posed his most speciﬁc depth
chart of the Spring. _

On offense, senior James holds
the number'one position and El-
liot the second spot for quarter-

’ back. “James is developing rap-.

til’

idly and he strikes me as a pass-
er,” said Hart, “but he also
proved he can run and is very
quick coming out of the back
ﬁeld.

At tailback and fullback Bobby
Dyer. and Mike Raklewicz are
slated as starters. “Both- looked
good,” Hart expressed. Raklewicz
missed the ﬁrst ,week of drills"
due to mononucleosis. ' '

Junior Joe Curtin and Skip

Orzulak, a sophomore, are in a
head and head ﬁght for the
fourth backﬁeld position at wing-
back. “In the scrimmage, Curtin
moved ahead of Arzulak,” Hart
said. .

I The William Pitt Debate
Union (WPDU) won several
honors at the Annual Penn-
sylvania Forensic Tourna-

ment this weekend.
Mahmood Mamdani, liberal arts
_ junior, won the Men’s Division of
the State Oratory Championship
r for the second time. His oratory,
" “The Lonely Volunteer,” discuss-
ed human understanding of for-
.i' eign people and their needs.
Beth Lezaric won the Women’s
- Division of the State Oratory
- Championships.
V Fourth place in the debate tour-
: nament was captured by the de-
bate team of Armand Belly, Jef-
frey Leach, Michael Smith and
Thomas Zaucha. Smith was
‘named the Outstanding Debater
in the tournament and Belly and
Leach had the best affirmative
. record.

Carolyn Szolis placed third in
(the Women’s Division of State
Extempranous Championships.

Mamdani’s oratory said that
tourists fail “to understand that
India is not the Taj Mahal; and
L that there are people behind those
color slides. . . . Their condition
» is such that, if depicted on a pos-
ter, it would ruin the tourist in-
dustry of India. The skimming
_ eye of the tourist has successful-

‘ly evaded them.”

Men have only taken a super-
ﬁcial look, Mamdani cont-ends. An
antithesis to _this tourist group
is the Peace Corps volunteer.

“His is the dirty work of ﬁnd-
ing out what another culture is
like. His is the tedious task of
.working to unravel the traditions
of another culture. It is the lone-
‘-Fly volunteer, not the group, who
" is involved in a creative, organic
approach. It is he who is given
to the deliverance of the whole
of his faculties as he tries to
M comprehend the phenomena. He

begins where the tourist leaves
off.”

Continuing Mamdani said the
Peace Corps volunteer “brought
along with him a new involve-
ment, an involvement that shat-
tered stereotypes on both sides.
He came their not to subject peo-
ple to a precise rule, neither to
look at them as potential markets.
His was an attempt to meet peo-
ple on their own grounds, to
meet them on human terms, on
a basis of understanding, taking
their needs as human needs and
demonstrating a genuine desire
to help solve them. In the pro-
cess, the volunteer broke his own
stereotype, carried a new image
back with him, and will carry it
for the rest of his life.

Mamdani ended with, “The
lonely volunteer has a lesson to
teach us. It is when we have
learnt this lesson, when he have
learnt to understand that which
is different, when he have learnt
to accept the fate of every other
man as a part of our own fate; it
is then, and only then, that hu-
manity shall breath again.”

formers. “It was the stiffest com-
petition I’ve ever seen,” said
McKinnis. “With the large crowd
the pressure was really on. Every-
body was trying to hit perfect
