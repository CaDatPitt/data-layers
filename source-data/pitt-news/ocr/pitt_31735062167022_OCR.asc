UNIVERSITY ‘OF PITTSBURGH

Wallace Wins Spot
On Ballot, Reaffirms
Support of Viet War

by JEANNE ELKAN

and BARRY J. SHLACHTER

The outspoken ex-Governor of
Alabama, George Corley Wal-
lace, spoke at a gathering of 2,-
600 people at ‘the Pittsburgh

Hilton Hotel on Monday eve--

ing. Prior to his speech an an-
nouncement was made that Wal-
lace had just received 51,000
more votes than needed to get
on the Pennsylvania ballot.

This was accompanied by wild
applause and an organ rendition
of “Onward Christian Soldiers.”
Midpoint in his speech a walk-
out was staged by those people
disagreeing with his Vietnam po-
licy. Wallace commented, “Those
people belong in a good Federal
jail somewhere; that’s where
they belong. Anyone who does-
n’t know the difference between
dissent and treason . . . I'm
gonna draft some of- those.

“I believe in dissent,” he said,
but anyone protesting the war
in Vietnam, “that's so-methin’
else. We must obey law wheth-
er we think they’re just or un-
just. The lunatic crowd has no
solution . . . let’s apply some
good cab driver logic.”

Concerning states’ rights, he
recommended that the states of
the union should continue to de-
termine the policies of their
domestic institutions, and that
the “bearded bureaucrats and
psuedo -intellectuals” in Wash-
ington let the people in Ala-
bama and Pennsylvania decide
themselves.

“The time has come that the
steel workers, beauticians, com-
munications workers and little
businessmen show us that we
don’t nee-d any guidelines.” Gov.
Wallace reiterated that the gov-
ernment has tried too long to
solve all the problems itself in-
stead of letting the “goodness”
of the common people decide.

Wallace believes “there is a
breakdown of law and order
rampant throughout the nation.
I don’t care What grievances
small groups of people have ——
they’re not going to threaten Ana-
tio-nal security. Race is not in-
volved——all races want law and
order.

“The first thing I would do
as President is to make an an-
nouncement that I'd give my
moral support as President to
the policemen of this country
and to the ﬁremen of this coun-
try. I'd say, ‘we stand behind
you because you are the thin
line between complete anarchy
in the streets and the physical
9”

Wallace ended by saying,“Y0-u
stand with me and we, together,
can give courageous leadership
to millions of people through-
out this great nation. If the po-

liticians get in the way in 1968,
a lot of them are going to get
run over by this average man
in the street, this man in the
textile mill, this man in the steel
mill, this barber, the beautician,
the policem.an on the beat. They
are the ones —— and the small
businessman — I think those
are the mass of people that are
going to support a change on
the domestic scene in this coun-
try.”

Wallace noted that he may
only need 34 per cent to win a
plurality in the upcoming elec-
tions, and he aims to get it.

DR. CHARLES PEAKE
Comments on New Draft Rules

Wednesday, February 21, 1968

Dr. Peake Cites ‘Drastic’  
Graduate Enrollment

by ANNE DORN '

The new draft regulations will have a “drastic impact” on the
University graduate schools, according to Dr. Charles Peake, act-
ing provost. -

Dr. Peake commented on the announcement by the Selective
Service Commission which abolished all graduate and occupational
deferments as of June. The New York Times estimated that the
system will result in a 40-50 per cent ,decrease in graduate school
enrollment.

Dr. Peake said that the University estimates are close to those
of The Times, with a 3040 per cent decrease in the University grad-
uate enrollment. -

He pointed out that the smaller enrollment would not change
the programs themselves, but would affect the recruitment of fac-
ulty and -the department assignments of the faculty. '

The exceptions to the new draft law are for those graduate
students in medicine and dentistry. Dr. Peake believed that this
expection would not have an immediate effect on the enrollment
in the Medical School, since undergraduates must take sequential
courses in order to apply for admission to the school.

 

ESP Forum

 

Psychic Experience Exposed

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“I didn’t grow up doing
psychic things,” Jamie Gins-
berg said. “In fact I didn’t
start having psychic experi-
ences until a few years ago.”
Miss Ginsberg is one of the
participating speakers for a
forthcoming student-faculty for-

um on Extra-sensory Perception
(ESP).

Born in St. Louis, Miss Gins-
berg attended schools in New
York, Illinois, and Maryland be-
fore coming to the University.
She is presently working to-
ward a major in psychology.
she said,
“I can tell what other people
are saying. Of course, people I
know better are harder to work
with than total strangers. The
same is true for non-believers
of ESP. They don’t believe. so
they don’t make an effort to hide
their thoughts. The main point
is that I can't ﬁnd out what peo-
ple don’t want me to know,”
she added.

One of her first experiences
with psychic phenomenon was
a dream six months before Ken-
nedy’s assassination in which
she saw Mrs. Kennedy mourn-
ing in an official library. “I
didn’t know at the time what
had happened to the President,
but I knew it was something
horrible,” Miss Ginsberg said.

“I feel capable,”

She went on to point out that
an official library was built af-
ter the President’s death and
that Jaqueline Kennedy was pre-
sent at its dedication.

“Two years ago I predicted
the death of one of my friends
using tarot cards, and she died
two days after my prediction.
This time I was really shook
up,” she confessed.

 

“My friends tometimes get
tired of my predictions because
it puts me in an ‘I told you so’
position,” Miss Ginsberg stated.
“I don’t consider myself super-
ior, and in fact, my ability
makes me feel like a receiving
set,” she said.

Miss Ginsberg has her own
theory on which qualities make
the most receptive psychic per-
son. “A person must be able to
verbalize his feelings and to in-
terpret symbols well,” she said.
“He must be willing to accept
the idea that strange things are
possible. I’ve found that the
people who are most receptive

are those who are good in mu-
sic and art and are aware of the

unconscious aspects of things,” 1

she added.

She has been able to describe
things and events that have oc-
curred in the past in great de-
tail.

Miss Ginsberg does not give
advice in terms of what an in-
dividual should do. “I can only
describe what the situation is,”
she stressed.

“Tragedies are the easiest to
tune in on,” she stated. “They
are in a more tangible form be-
cause they‘ are the things peo-
ple are most anxious about.
They involve stronger feelings
than minor incidents,” she said.

Miss Ginsberg feels that her
ESP intiution gives her success
in working with disturbed chil-
dren. “I know why they do
things as soon as they do them,”
she said.

She went on to say that “I’m
not very superstitious, and I'm
not afraid of much. Lately, I've
had more control over my ex-
periences, so I rarely get them
when I don’t want them.”

In reference to telling a per-
son his future, she believes that
“it is best to suspend judgment.”

Furthermore, the “medical
schools are not in the position
to accept more students. At the
present rate of admission, more
acceptances can't be accommo-
dated."

The Times stated that the
draftees will include “the June
graduates of four year colleges,
graduate students, and men who
will receive their master's de-
gree this June. Dr. Peake as-
serted that the decrease in de-
ferments may cause an “in-
crease in opportunities for wom-
en to earn scholarships and fel-
lowships.”

Rough estimates have it that
41 percent of the 350,000 college
seniors and 144,000 ﬁrst year
graduate students will be draft-
ed. According to The Times,
“the magnitude of the effect can
be ascertained when the major
portion of these 225,000 men —.—
the 150,000 who may not choose
to enlist and are drafted out-
right—-is compared to the 14,-
000 four year college graduates
who will be drafted during the
current ﬁscal year.”

Dr. Peake said that Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar has request-
ed a second, careful review from
each dean for deﬁnite statistics
on University graduates and de-
ferments. The reports are be-
ing collected now.

a chance to fall on your face

Most of our top people have at one time or other.
The experience is enlightening. That’s why we make
such a big thing of it.

V We put plenty of responsibility on our new people.
Some stagger a little. Others buckle at the knees. Then
we try to shore them up, but we don't take the load off.

After a while (with considerable effort on their
part), they gradually learn to handle the job. Then we
usually add more work. We ﬁnd people grow fast this way.

Of course, it's risky. There are some scary moments
for management (they tend to grey hair and baldness
at an early age). But, they remember they were given
the chance to fall on their faces too. So they resist the
temptation to come to the rescue.

If you're looking for a chance to fall on your face,
we'll give it to you.

SG Senate: A Need for Re- evaluation

During the past Student Government (SG) campaign, much of the
criticism of SG as it currently exists centered around the actions of the
SG executive. People tended to ignore that the SG President and Vice
President suffered greatly because of an ineffective Senate which was
always quick to abuse them but slow to assist them.

It is all too easy to castigate the executive branch of SG while excus-
ing the Senate's performance because of a “lack -of direction.” Obviously, it
must be a, reciprocal relationship in order for SG to. effectively operate.
We must stress the recipro-cal aspect of this relationship. An SG execu-
tive branch -cannot do it alone. And no matter how good SG President
Ken Schueler’s intentions are during the coming year, if his Senate
fails him and repeats the performance of last year’s Senate, his efforts

will be greatly hampered.

Perhaps the ineffectiveness of the Senate lies in the lack of defini-
tion of its role. _If a, senator is to distinguish himself by his performance
i'n the Senate, he can follow no clear-cut road to success; he must initiate
on his own. Outstanding senators in the past have been the ones with
enough drive and perseverance to be outstanding in spite of a system
that discourages fine performances by having no apparent route to fol-
low. Only a handful of senators in the past few years have distinguish-
ed themselves in that body, and those who fade into the woodwork can

 What Is Wrong — III

readily excuse themselves because they are undoubtedly in the major-
ity, and this protection of numbers allows them to feel no real drive
to do otherwise.

The inability of the Senate to distinguish itself as a body has allow-
ed it to achieve distinction only one time a year: when parties need sen-
atorial slates. Then, countless students want to be senators. How quick-
ly this glow wears off in the aftermath of reality. It is exciting to par-
ticipate in a political campaign, but it’s hard work and a grueling task
to be an effective senator. All too few senators even try.

This state of affairs is unfortunate, for the position of SG senator
should be second only to the SG executive branch in terms of positions on
this campus, yet SG senator is currently a minor title. This is true al-
though the SG officials have the awesome responsibility of representing
the entire student body and are the only ones elected by all of‘ the stu-
dents. But unless the Senate distinguishes itself, it will continue to be
a body with a prestigeous title and no real effectiveness.

We urge our new SG President Ken Schueler and Vice President
Frank Tutino to work with the new senators to revitalize the Senate.
For unless the Senate becomes a powerful, cohesive body, SG as a whole
will never be a strong organizaton.

Letters to the Editor

 

 

Apathy Plus

STUDENT GOVERNMENT (SG) has been like
the Late Show: it has offered nothing except old
re-runs that no one is particularly interested to
see. And if the viewers should ask for something
better, the show’s network would deny the request
on some sort of monetary grounds.

At every election, an individual candidate ap-
pears to arouse uncommon interest in SG. He is
usually defeated, then SG lapses back into the
totally uninteresting “activity” that it should not
be. This year’s election threatened to be the most
boring in years until Armand Belly dove in with
a really different splash. He should be given an
award for novelty. But the big names and mouths
of the past-Ruskay, Stern, Schweder, Ainisman—
are gone, and the sophomore and freshman classes
appear to have no such potential rabel-rousers.

SG should be more than just the plaything of
a few controversial candidates. The blame for
SG’s ineffectiveness lies with both the administra-

" tion and the students. This blame is complex, and

too many abstracts are present for the problem
to be easily dealt with.

THE ADMINlSTRATION’S GUILT is not direct.
They have done far too little to aid basic student
problems such as athletics, apathy, fraternity and
dorm social life, etc. Administrative aid in any

I of these areas might produce a more unified and
.- effective student body which, in turn, would sup-

port its own governmentand allow a ruling body

. to make powerful and meaningful demands. The

administration would have to comply to an extent
‘or face a cohesive opposition.

The administration does not bear all the blame
for its apparent disinterest in the students. It
spends most of its time worrying about total fi-
nancial problems. It is presently more important
to keep the whole University solvent than to short-
en the lines at Student Records. Why would the
administration want a unified mass of students
screaming for expensive improvements when it
has to cut teachers’ salaries? As long as the pres-
ent situation exists, the administration can’t be
expected to raise SG's status above that of a
token voice in University affairs.

Nor can the administration bear all the blame
for keeping SG inept. The student body has the
direct responsibility, and it cannot claim to have
other, more important problems. A perfect ex-
ample of student-caused SG ineffectiveness occured

' this past year.

from the Cathedral to elect the much more inter-
esting and controversial John Ruskay? Ruskay
may have accomplished no more than Frederick
did, but he probably would have had more sup-
port. But no matter who is elected, he should rep-
resent the entire school, and no one should feel the
need of having a balanced ticket instead of a com-
petent one.

The Frederick-Ruskay caseis conjecture; the
apathy that caused it is not. The advantages of a
unified support for SG need not further be ex-
plained.

SG officers and senators are students too, and
they bear as much guilt as other students for their
own ineffectiveness. They are not apathetic, or
they would not have run for office. But by weeks
of haggling over tiny issues, miserable attendance
at meetings, senators talking endlessly for the
sake of hearing themselves talk and countless un-
publicized instances of idiotic politics and back-
stabbing, they have made a mockery of their meet-
ings and have driven the student’s only hope for
improvement into a bog of ineptitude.

FOR THE SG LEADERS, the world “petty” can
substitute for the adjective “apathetic.”

Criticism’ without suggestion for improvement
is worthless. So as long as the administration will
grant nothing but a few placebos, and as long as
the student body doesn’t give a damn, how can SG
become a worthwhile institution?

The elected -leaders will have to get over their
pettiness in order to overcome the faults of the
administration and student body. The leaders will
have to become exactly what no one on this cam-
pus is now: unified and mutually cooperative.

SG LEADERS will have to work with each
other, with other representative groups such as
MDC, IFC. AWS and the Commuter Association
to obtain their respective desires, with the Pitt
News to gain mass support by publicity and with
the administration to aid all students,

Create unity and cooperation among student
leaders, and these qualities from the student mass
will follow.

Such cohesiveness is at present incredibly ideal.
istic. if n0t impossible. But it can be obtained to
a degree. SG. President Ken Schueler appears to
be a forceful and competent leader. He may be the
first to use the full Power of his office. His Posi-
tive Action Team has an overwhelming majority in
the Senate. SG leadership unity may be ‘a fact
illgliltt now. Scheuler is an idealistic person, and this

m8y_glVe him the stubbornness and fortitude
to deal with a reluctant administration.

This year, SG obtained a 10% student discount
f°r bf’°k5- But the prices for notebooks and other
5'-ipphes Went UP, appearing to nullify a rare SG
success. But the price was not the fault of SG
the administration, nor the book store. the pub:
lishers set their own prices. This is not a case.of
SG futility. it is an example of what Sc; can do_

STUDENT LEADERS themselves will have to
9ver°°me th‘? mas? apathy if they cannot abolish
It. No one Will do It for them. Tradition is against
‘h°m- The? have onlv their own potential as a

Student Knocks

O
RegionalCampus
Editor, The Pitt News:

I have just recently transfer-
red from the Bradford campus
of the University to Adelp-hi
University‘ -and would appreci-
ate stating my views publicly
about the regional campuses.
These campuses are falsely iden-
tiﬁed with the University——they
do not compare academically or
socially. The Bradford campus
was —— and is —— completely iso-
late-d. It is two hundred miles
outside of Pittsburgh. College is

not supposed to broaden only a -

person's mind, but his entire
being. Bradford does neither.
The Unviversi-try states -that these
campuses were established to al-
low more people to attend col-
lege. The Bradford campus can
not even pretend to offer a col-
legiate atmosphere.

As an entering freshman, I
was looking forward to enter-
ing college. I was sorely disap-
pointed. I have no complaints
about the courses that I took,
except for one—-Biology 12 (B0-
tany). The teacher was a retired
high school teacher. She prob-
ably knew her material at one

time, but as my teacher, s.he got
her facts confused and could
not teach. Her labs were a joke
to all of us. Not once did we
examine a live plant, we looked
at prepared slides and drew our
lab plates from the text. The
reasons offered by the Admin-
istration are clear: no other
teacher is available.

I ask: is it fair to offer a poor-
ly naught course because of the
given reason? No psychology
courses are offered because no
teacher can be found. Thus, peo-
ple at Bradford majoring in
psychology are forced to take
courses not needed for their
majors. Why? Because teachers
do not want to teach at Brad-
ford where nothing ever occurs.

Socially, the Bradford cam-
pus offers nothing. By socially,
I do not mean only dances, par-
ties and weekends. Perhaps a
better word would be culturally.
At Bradford, there are no mu-
seums, no plays, no concerts
and only one movie theatre. Peo-
ple at Bradford campus are
trapped.

I think that it's time for the
main cam.pus to take a good,
hard look at their regional cam-
puses and do something to bet-
ter them.

WVU F rosh Here,
Looking for Revenge

The freshman basketball
team is expecting a hungry
team tonight when the Lit-

  tle Mountaineers of West Vir-

ginia invade the Field House
at 6:15.

P The West Virginia frosh are
good enough to give most fresh-

 man teams trouble. They are
’ . 9-4 this year, and they have dis-

played an ability to score com-
parable to the undeifeated Du-
quesne fl‘0Slh that beat the Cubs

_f twice.

But the Little Mountaineers

black strong rebounding and a

s-olid defense. The Cubs took ad-
vantage of these weaknesses in
a. clash earlier this season in
West Virginia, Winning by 17
points.

When the freshman cagers

beat WVU, Bob Gailus, their
big man at 6-6, was in the line-
up. Tonight Gailus will not play,
and without him the compara-
tively small Cubs are compara-
tively smaller. The rebounding
might suffer.

The Cubs also shot exception-
ally well that game. Mike Cald-
well shot 10 for 15 from the
ﬂoor and scored 21 points in all,
to spark the win.

But the Cubs have been eratic
shooters all year long and a
miserable shooting night will
not surprise anyone. And a mis-
erable shooting night could give
the West Virginia frosh its tenth
victory. Frosh basketball coach
Tim Grgurich is hoping that
Caldwell will come through
again. It could make the differ-
ence.

Syracuse

Comeback
Wins, 85-7 1

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports Editor

For 30 minutes Monday
night, Syracuse coach Fred
Lewis stayed with his new
ball-control offense, and the Pan-
thers led the Orange, 46-43. Then
Lewis reverted to his old, pres-
sure defense, and the cagers re-
acted like the basketball team
they are, as Syracuse went on
to an 85-71 win.

West Virginia, which recently
defeated Syracuse and holds a
lop-sided victory over the Pan-
thers, provides the opposition
tonight, and there appears to
be little chance of the cagers
breaking their three game los-
ing streak.

In the first thr-ee minutes af-
ter Syracuse went into the full-
court press on Monday they
stole the ball four times, out-
scored the Panthers, 12-2, and
iced the game. The key play
was a six-pointer by Vaughn
Harp-er.

Harper, who also hit two long
jumps during the spurt, stole
a rebound from Charlie Hunt
and converted a layup as Hunt
fouled him. When Hunt pro-
tested, he was called for a tech-
nical. Harper converted his foul,
Rich Cornwall made the tech-
nical, and when the Orange
brought the ball into play Har-
per hit another jumper to com-
plete the play.

With the Panthers trailing 68-
57 and three minutes remaining,
they tried to press Syracuse.
However, Cornwall broke it sin-

glehanded, bringing the ball up .-

hirnself and then passing under-
neath to Wayne Ward and Har-
per, who made the layups, an-d,

on three occasions a foul shot
also. Syracuse’s 1-a-sit 23 points
came on layups and resulting
foul shots.

Up until the Orange applied
pressure, it appeared the Pan-
thers had a chance "to spring an
upset. Sparked by the hot shoot-
ing of Tony DeLisio and "Steve
Stevenson, they led throughout
much of the ﬁrst half, and were
deadlocke-d at 31-31 at the inter-
mission.

Stevenson, getting his ﬁrst
chance to start in a long time,
responded with an aggresive
game. He rebounded well against
the taller Orangemen, including
one leap that brought the mea-
ger crowd to its feet. Stevenson
had dived to the ﬂoor to steal
the ball, only to see George
Hicker resteal it and ﬁre a shot.
Steve then got up off the hard-
wood and leaped over 6'7” Ward
to capture the rebound.

Mike Patcher drives past Syracuss Wne Ward.

  

He ﬁnished with 12 points,
while DeLisio, wh-o had a hot
night from the outside, was high
with 19. Rob McFarland added
14 for the Panthers.

Frank Hamblen, averaging
just six points a game, led the
Orange with 20, including 16 in
the ﬁrsrt half. Harper had 15,
including a dozen in the second

half. Ward sco-red 18, all on lay- *

ups and fouls.
West Virginia is led by Ron

1 Williams, latest in a series of

high -scoring guards, who has
a 21 point average. Mountaineer
coach Bucky Waters has said
that Williams could score as
much as Pete Maravich or Cal-
vin Murphy, the nation’s leading
scorers, “if I turned him loose.”

“But their teams don’t. win,”
Waters noted. Tonight, with vic-
tory almost assured, Waters
may take the reins off Williams.

Pleasure
Palace Grabs
Mat Victory

Pleasure Palace put four cham-
pions and three runners-up to-
gether in forming their domin-
ation of the dorm wrestling
tournaments last Week.

The Palace totaled 52 points,
with the nearest challenge com-

"ing from the Playboys’ Pent-

hous-e’s 31 points. Merd House
and Sutherland House were
deadlocked in the third position
with 11 points each.

The 120-pound class was one
of the Palace’s strong group-
ings. Joe Siebert grabbed the
top sp-ot, edging teammate Bob
Malyuk, 5-4, in the title match.
Together, the two collected 11

points, sweeping the light-
weights.
Terry Faber pinned Larry

Nelson of the Playboys in the
150-pound division, racking up
eight more points for the Pa-
lace. Palace’s Kerry Krause (10
points) and Jack »Keiser (six
points) dueled at 160, with
Krause coming out on top, 7-1.

The final win for the champs
came in the two-man 190-pound
class. Ron Levandowski pinned
Stratford’s Dave Dibbley in only
15 seconds.

The second- place Playboys
took the most points in one
weight class, snatching 17 po-ints
in the 170-pound division. Steve
Schram and Jim Ayers ﬁnished
one-two in the class for the
Playboys.

The other winners in the tour-
ney were Al Silverman of Su-
therland (130), Bob Slough of
Keystone (140), Jim Burtt of
Mad (180) and Joe Spicko of
Hawthorne (heavy weight).
