Panthers
Favored

Over W. Va.

By STAN SKIRBOLL
Unless Pitt football changes
for the better, the band may per-
manently include "Oh Dear ,

What Can The Matter Be?” in its
repertiore.

Big Chance

Tomorrow the Panthers will get
their big chance of the season to
win a ball game, as the Moun-
taineers from West Virginia invade
the Stadium. S small crowd of
15,000 is expected.

Art Lewis’ Mounties come to
Pitt with a two-win, four-loss re-
cord, but sta tistically,they sport
the top aerial offense in the East.

Chiefly responsible for West
Virginia’s aerial attack is left-
hander Kent Bartges of Masontown.
Bartges, whose favorite receiver
,is End ‘Paul Bischoff of Beaver
Falls, has smacked his target 33
times for 533 yards and three
scores.

Panthers Favored

Although the bookies have the
Panthers listed as a 13-point fa-
vorite against their perennial ri-
vals from the hills, the Mounties
have more than a better chance to
spring an upset.

If the Panthers continue with
the same type of play that marked
their game last week, the Moun-
ties may have an easier time than

most fans expect.

All week long, the Pitt fans
have been asking questions about
the team. Questions like: Why
does Coach Len Casanova keep
Quarterback Bob Osterhout out of
the game so long? When is the
Pitt offense going to open up? Why
doesn't Pitt pass more often? And
what has happened to the sharp
tackling and rugged blocking of
last year?

Play-Calling Poor

Casanova has explained that
the quarterbacks’ play-calling has
been “too hit-and-miss.” But the
signal-callers can’t be blamed,
Cas said, "for they are still young
and inexperienced.”

"As for opening up our offense,”
Casanova explained, “we've tried
to tell our quarterbacks that third
down is too late to start tossing
passes — that the defense is set
for one by that time.

"When the boys run a play,” the
grid coach continued, "and it
isn't successful, they want to for-
get it, never thinking that it might

fell far short of its goal. This was
because too many students did not

goal this year is to have every Pitt
student contribute two dollars or
more. Lets all give and put the

The goaipost protection plan,
originally suggested by J. Edward

ing.

The idea was devised after Pitt
students were thwarted in their
attempt to bring back West Vir-

Pitt win at Morgantown.

BAND GOES TO NOTRE DAME
IF Council Contributes

$600 To Windup Drive

By AL BIERMAN

The band is going to Notre Dame.

Inter-fraternity Council voted Wednesday night to contribute
the money it had set aside for favors for the IF formal dance.
The contribution amounted to $600 and brought the total collected
to $2152.52. According to Robert L. Arthur, director of the Var-
sity Marching Band, the absolute minimum operating expense is

The drive, suggested over three weeks ago by editorials
appearing in the Pitt News, was conducted by IF Council. The
council passed a motion to set up a collection system to raise
the necessary amount to finance the trip.

Fraternity men went about the campus with collection boxes
getting contributions from the general student body.

At Wednesday night’s meeting of IF council, a recommenda-
tion was made by the executive committee that the $600 for favors
be contributed to the "Send the Band to Notre Dame” fund. It
was stressed that this amount would bring the drive to the op-

After a great deal of discussion the recommendation was
made into a motion that was carried unnanimously.

IF Council Praised

About the contributions made by the council and the drive in
general, Dean of Men T.W. Biddle said. “I think IF Council has
shown a wonderfully generous and unselfish spirit by working in
the interest of the University and the band. Not only did they
carry the burden of soliciting, but they contributed generously in
the first instance and finally put the campaign across through

Band director Robert L. Arthur said of the drive, "The won-
derful spirit shown by IF Council and the whole student body in
making it financially possible for the Varsity Marching Band to
represent the University in South Bend for the Notre Dame game
is something of which everyone connected with the University
should be exceptionally proud. The band can be counted upon to
put forth every effort to bring the best possible entertainment to
the spectators at the game as well as the television and radio

Grateful Band

Speaking as a band member and
for the rest of the bandsmen,George
Witkovich, president of Kappa
Kappa Psi, national honorary band
fraternity, stated, “On behalf of the
members of the band I would like
to thank the student body for the
support and confidence shown the
Varsity Marching band. Also many
thanks and congratulations to IF
council for sponsoring and handl-
ing the drive.”

Until now, only 30 oer cent of
the polled students have said that
the state graft probe now being
conducted in Pitts burgh has affected

A trend which has been growing
steadily since the poll started is
the split vote. One per cent of stu-

James H. Duff for senator and

Richardson Dilworth for governor.

Du ff-Fine Lead in Pitt News Poll

With 4 per cent of an undergraduate student body of 7532

opinion poll being conducted by the Pitt News.

on domestic and foreign policy did

not influence their selection of
candidates.
All the undergraduate schools

except the Engineering and Mines

Almost one half per cent preferred
Judge John S. Fine for governor
with Francis Myers for senator.

A small minority of 15 per cent
said that President Truman's recent
aggressive action on domestic and
foreign policies affected their sel-
ection for the two top state offices.

Republicans Favored
Most of the students agreed that
the Pennsylvania senatorial race
was not as important nationally as
the Taft-Ferguson race in Ohio.
Many of these same students felt

favored the Republican Party.

In the college
candidates edged the Dilworth
ticket by the small margin of nine
votes. Men in the senior, junior,
and sophomore classes voted three
to one for Duff and Fine. The frosh
balloting was split. Women in the
college wanted Dilworth two to one.

This Thursday, November 9, at
8 p.m. is the date set for the newly
formed campus group’s meeting on
the seventh floor of the Cathedral.

Mr. Hovey's talk will be of parti-

by modern art. He is well-known as
a critic of world art.

important current activity in art

SC C k D S ' 1 R les

The Student Congress social committee announced Monday
that disciplinary action will be taken against any campus organi-
zation which violates the social rules of the committee.

Chairman Dick Shallenberger said the following penalties
have been adopted by the committee:

by Andy Schurman which read as
follows:

“Resolved: That Student Con-
gress stress upon the student body
the fact all pep rallies fall under
the leadership of the Assemblies
Committee, and, whereas, proper
leadership is afforded all rallies,
the student body should maintain a
mature attitude so that all rallies
may be carried out for the enjoy-
ment of all concerned."

President Howard Greenberger
then turned the chair over to Vice-
President Bill McKinley and took
the floor with a motion to investi-
gate the possibilities of having
Christmas‘ vacation extended one
day. He said this was to allow an
extra day to get back to classes
for those students who spend the
holidays out of town. The motion
carried, Greenberger volunteered
to do the investigating himself.

Congress then followed up with

Students who miss classes to
cast their ballot in the forthcoming
state election will be counted ab-
sent, according to Dean Theodore
Biddle.

Dean Biddle says, "This is not
anauthorized excuse, but some in-
structors will probably allow it.”

One of the big questions that has
arisen on campus is “Can out-of-
state students mail their ballots
home?”

Charles B. Nutting, dean of the
School of Law, says "It is im-
possible to generalize this situa-
tion. In some states it is allowed,
while in others it is not.”

Advice to these students is to
write their country officials in their
home state or to call their respec-
tive party headquarters in Pitts-
burgh.

Students attending Pitt and living

in Pennsylvania but away from home, --

will have to go to their home town
to cast their vote. In Pennsylvania,
it is not permissible to send a vote

At halftime on Nov. 11 the Varsity Marching Band will be on
the playing field at Notre Dame. IF Council’s final contribution
of 600 dollars sent the total in the Drum over the $2000 mark.
While $2500 was the goal, the sum collected will be sufficient to
send the band.

it proper to single out those who made it a success. First on any
list must come IF Council and its president, Jim Morton. Without
their support the black in the Drum would only total $700. They
got behind the drive in its initial stage, and stuck with it to the
end. To them and to the frat men who walked through the campus
with the "Send the Band” boxes go more than just a large share
of the credit.

All of the other campus organizations who joined in the drive
with enthusiasm and cash come in for their share of praise.

Mayor Lawrence and Coroner McClelland are in for several
hearty pats on the back.Theymade the first outside contributions

' and started the bandwagon rolling off campus.

The alumni were generous in their reaction and did much to-
ward sending the band to Notre Dame.

But in the final analysis it was the man-in-halls” who
made the band trip a reality. From his pockets a stream of coins
and green paper went into the IF boxes.

The successful culmination of the drive is a credit to the
entire school. It was an all-student project and as such is a won-
derful display of school spirit.

And the band? We are certain they will show up to our ad-
vantage at South Bend. It was a realization of their excellence
that started the Drive. ’

 An Outside Election

If the downtown newspapers were operating now, they would
certainly be running editorials urging the civic-minded to vote
in Tuesday’s'general election. _They would, no doubt, point out
that only during elections is it possible for‘the voter to express
effectively his approval or disapproval of his government. It is
then, they would say, that the citizen can determine the type of
men and the kind of government he will live under. It is a citi-
zen’s duty to go to the polls and vote, they would say.

All of this would be expressed verbosely and with the utmost
piousness. But that would not detract from its truth or from its

wisdom. Every ‘student who is registered should vote if it is at
all possible. General elections should be something more than
just topics for poli sci majors and their profs to discuss. And
voting should not just be a topic for an editorial.‘

. Well Done Frosh

The freshman sponsors of last Saturday’s Homecoming Dance
deserve more than a paternal pat on the back for the job they did
in making a success out of a predicted flop.

They had everything against them in the way of time, ex-
perience, and competition, but -still managed to come through
with a financial and social success that points toward a repeat
performance at next year’s Homecoming.

A sincere ‘well done,’ frosh -- we didn't think you had it in
you.

Paragraph Wisdom

There is a good chance that the Panther will bring home a

West Virginia bacon tomorrow. If they do a rally will probably
result. Let’s keep it on the campus.

"Seein’ is believin’.” And now that we know the band will
be on the field at halftime we hope the sponsors of the Notre
Dame football games will let us see it.

With an eye toward a possible victory over West Virginia at
the Stadium tomorrow afternoon, the Undergraduate Deans have
scheduled time for a victory rally second hour Monday in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall, with the stipulation that students re-
turn immediately to their classes at the end of the hour.

The announcement will probably be met with various reactions

ily mine or even of many people
around Pitt, is the question: What
does a mob demonstration at Tech
on Monday have to do with the foot-
ball victory of 20-odd men at the
Stadium Saturday? From that stand-
point, a wild exhibition of per-

in various quarters. Certainly, ,
there is some sentiment that a Dcan Biddle, have had to go Over
victory over West Virginia is to Carnegie Tech after each dem-

scarcely worthy of a victory cele-
bration. On the other hand, a large
number of victory-starved students
will expect the rally, and some will
probably want to take advantage of
the opportunity to take off from
class and do a little hell-raising.

It’s with the hell-raisers I'm con-
cerned here.

They Hate Pitt

A lot of people are sick of Pitt
victory parades - merchants who
have had signs torn down and win-
dows brpken, civic, professional,
and private organizations who have

onstration’ and make like a door-
mat for the Tech top brass. After
the doormat act, Tech, along with
private citizens and institutions,
has demanded and received cash
reparations for damages, usually
running into hundreds of dollars.

Bad Business

Since such money probably comes
out of activities fund accounts,
which in turn are filled by tuition
payments, we've been cutting our
own throats for some time now.
That's not good business.

The worst aspect of these boom-
erang demonstrations is the opinions
on Pitt students and Pitt that they
create. Fun is fun, and just about
everyone in Pittsburgh is happy
when Pitt wins, but it's ahorse
from the other side of the rainbow
when the results add up to damaged
property and civil disturbance. So

owners who have had lawns tramp-
led, students and teachers with
classes interrupted, and just about
every person in Pittsburgh who has
ever had the misfortune of being
caught in the middle of victory
demonstration, which is usually a
polite name for nothing more than

‘an undisciplined mob riot. IE’: not good public relations»
Them’s harsh words, all right, en er’ A

but maybe it's time for some harsh Bad sense

words. For four years, at least,

University authorities, usually And 330313‘ angle» 11°C 116033531"

verted school spirit isn’t even good
sense.

No one, other than the students
concerned (and they constitute a
minority of the entire group) ap-

dent mob like the ones that ran
wild after the OSU upset in 1947
and the Penn State game in 1948.
But an orderly demonstration, like
the one after last year’s out-of-
this-world victory over Pennsyl-
vania, attracts praise, as did that
one. Letters, comments, and an

editorial in a daily newspaper last
year praised the Pitt student body
for ‘coming of age.’ And for once;
it was the game that was remem-
bered,not the rally that-reduced the
game's excitement to insignifi-
cance.

Pittsburgh is becoming proud of
its University, and is beginning
to come through with the recogni-
tion the institution and its students
deserve. Let’s not dampen that
pride or balk that support with a
wild, unnecessary fling Monday.

Better we should save the noise
for Notre Dame, yet.

College Papers Sickening

By MYRON KOPELMAN

At Michigan state College an incident took place this past
summer which points up a sickening situation in the collegiate

otherwise, that they wish to see
trivia and trivia only in the college

neW5PaPe1'f1e1d- vention would indicate. But it is

doubtful if the editorial writer ex-
pected such a harsh reaction as
the suspension of publication by
the university.

At any rate,the school announced
that the paper would not reappear
until fall, and at that time, only
under strict college departmental
supervision-.

The point of the story is that it
is this shortsighted censorship on
the part of college administrators
which is largely responsible for
the deplorable state of the bulk of
the nation's college newspapers.

According to the Associated
Collegiate Press, publication of
the Michigan State News was sus-
pended because of an editorial
criticism of the Wolverine Boys’
State, a citizenship institute under
the sponsorship of the American
Legion.

“The State News,” reported the
ACP, “objected to what it con-
sidered the militaristic methods
used at Boys’ State, and particu-
larly objected to a mock trial of
an alleged Communist which it
considered a travesty of the pro-
cedures of American justice.”

Chance for First Win

Buckeyes
Upset By
Desota

Another team was knocked from
‘the list of undefeated intramural
squads Tuesday, when the Buck-
eyes, previously unbeaten, were
handed a 19-6 shellacking by De-
sota Hall. '

The combination of Bill Sugalski
passing to Ray Lynn accounted for
two -Desota‘ Hall scores, the first
and last ones of the game. The duo
tallied early in the first half to
make the only points in‘ the initial
period.

Bill Donnelly shook loose in the
end zone and snagged an aerial
from John Monohan shortly after
halftime to pad the Desota lead.

The demoralized Buckeyes put
together two long passes to set up
their only touchdown. Bill Ford
flipped the score to Kay Lewis.

_ Despite the loss, the Buckeyes
are still in first place, all other
teams in the American League also
having at least one defeat, and

a several with not as many wins as
the Buckeyes show in their 3-1

A record. Desota Hall sports a two
and one scorecard this season.

DISCARDS from

week against Miami.

The ex—Westinghouse fullback
carried the ball on an end sweep
and picked up five yards. He was
then yanked from the game.

Since the lossof Paul Chess,
five men have tried to fill the
Pitt fullback slot with little

' success. Joe Capp, Joe Schmidt,
John Huzvar, Davy Fyock, and
Bill Ewing have all been unim-
pressivg.

So, Coach Len Casanova
could do worse than give Guad-
agnino a real crack at the job.

IIISIII

Miami Coach Andy Gustafson
made a recent statement that "if a
player doesn't give extra effort in
practice, he won’t give it in the
game."

But there are plenty of good
players who look on practice as so
much drudgery and just go through
the motions. When it means some-
thing in a game, though, you'll find
that msyjre the~boys that’ll give
fheir all.

And what about the players who
are stars in practice and flops in
actual game. Take a look at the Pitt
team practicing some time, and see
what we mean.

IM Council

Formed

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

The work of the Intramural De‘-
partment never ceases.

Although Director Leo Bemis is
off to another successful season
of intramural athletics, he still
hammers away for more represent-
ation from the student body.

Bemis has aimed his sights this
time directly at the student body.
The IM director feels that a great
majority of the daytime students
know little about the IM program as
it exists today.

To counteract this lack of knowl-
edge, Bemis has organized the Intra-
mural Council. This council at pre-
sent is made up of many important
groups and organizations.

 

Bemis also sees the necessity of
interesting IM participants-to enter
teams inayear—round sports program.

Included among them are repre-
sentatives from the Faculty, YMCA,
Ellsworth Center,’ Desota Hall,
Fraternities, and the Engineering
and the Medical Schools.

A few suggestions have been
made by the council to acquaint the
students with theintramural program.
They include:

' 1-Printing of literature to be dis-

tributed among the student body.

2-Plaering of posters throughout
the university.

This group of representatives will
also act as a committee to:

1-Air problems

2-Determine policies

3—Discuss general eligibility rules.

conservative. That's why there’s

so much of the tackle and guard
plays called.”

Osly Inconsistent

“As far as Osterhout is con-
cerned, he’s a hot and cold ball
player. We’re trying to bring him
along so that he will be more
consistent.”

The perplexed mentor also said
that he was extremely dissatisfied
with the team’s blocking and tackl-
ing. Poor blocking has been one

reason for the skimpy yardage
gained.
To add to Casanova’s ‘woes,

word comes from Trainer Howard
Waite that left halfbacks Bill
Sichko, Armand DiFonso, and Tony
Simile may miss tomorrow’s game.
Sichko has his ribs taped up,

while DiFonso and Simile have “

halfback Bill Reynolds is limping

With the loss of three left half-
backs, little Davey Fyock, the
team’s utility man, may take over.
Last week, Fyock a right half,
ran a few plays from fullback.
Tackle Bob Brennen, who re-
ceived a mild concussion last
week, will also miss tomorrow’s
game.

Seems this football season

were in the depths of a depression.
A 69-O atrocity at the hands’ of
Michigan had been every bit as dis-
turbing to alumni nervous systems
as this year’s 41-0 loss at Ohio
State. Going into the West Virginia
game, the season was pretty well
shot. There wasn’t a whole lot for
any player to die for.

‘Repeated losses had, of course,
taken the zip out of the Pitt boys,
and since the Mountaineers seldom -
had been taken seriously in the
past, the Pitt coaching staff just
could not get its club “up” for the
game.

Naturally, the Mountaineers re-
garded a victory over Pitt as the
summit of glory, so Coach Bill
Kern, an ex-Pitt star, had no morale
problems whatever. And his "up”
team went out and thumped the
"down” team, 17-2.

Wolves Howled

Incidentally, it was in that ’47
season that Milligan took an ear
beating from the fans for not playing
Pitching Paul Rickards, a passing
tailback who went pro the next
year with the Los Angeles Rams
but failed to stick.

Mike was in the same shoes as
Len Casanova, who is presently
getting the business for holding out
Quarterback Bob Osterhout until“
the fourth quarter in last week's
Miami game. You can't expect a

 

pitcher to look major league if you
stick him in in the seventh inning

with the enemy ten runs ahead,
argue Cas’ critics.
The point looks logical from

here. But then again, you cannot,
on one count, scratch a man who
won the Orange Bowl last year.

Bad All Over

Speaking of bowls, none of the
now-scattered members of last
year's Panther coaching staff are
going to any this year.

Milligan, present line coach at
Southern California under Jeff Cra-
vath,is working with a team that has
won one, tied one, and lost three.

At Harvard, Line Coach Ted
Schmitt and Backfield Coach Josh
Williams are wrestling with the
problems ofrefined football.They’ve
had not a single winning Saturday
in four times out.

End Coach ‘Bobby Timmons and
Backfield Coach John Chicketneo
stuck with Pitt; and of course the

situation here is obvious.

Harriers Face
Penn, Army

The Pitt harriers will engage in
their second triangular meet of the
season tomorrow when they travel to
Philadelphia to ‘run against Army
and Penn. 4

After dropping a close decision to
Ohio State last week, the Panther
thinclads have been hard at work
this week to avoid a repetition of
last year's quadrangular meet in-
volving Army, Columbia, and Penn.
The Blue-and—Gold came in third
with 69 points. Army won the meet
with an 18-point total. .

Earlier in the season Pitt won
handily overWestminster and Geneva
in the only other triangular meet

scheduled for the cross country
team.

Theta Chi, 6-0

The Theta Chi’s almost upset
the works as they were edged 6-0

by an undefeated Phi Ep team
Wednesday evening at Schenley
oval.

A Phi Ep team that looked sloppy
in both running and passing plays
managed to score one touchdown
against a defensively strong Theta
Chi team. The touchdown resulted
from a twenty yard touchdown pass
from Mickey Steiner to AlFinesman.

The Phi Ep defense also proved
strong as they staved off serious
scoring threats by the Theta Chis.
, The big game for the Phi Eps
comes next week when they meet
a so far undefeated PiKA team.

uy DUN MURDOCK

When football schedules move
into November, there is usually a
small and envied group of unde-
feated teams.Here at Pitt the fresh-
man football squad is Cathedral
U’s only claim to an undefeated
record among the fall sports.

The frosh have bowled over the
Ohio University frosh, 34-7, Kiski
PICP7 32-7, and Army, 16-13. They
are now idle until Friday night,
Nov. 17, when they meet the West
Virginia yearlings at Bridgeville.
Tickets for this game are now
available at the ticket office in
the Athletic Building.

Army Was Proof
With a starting line averaging
196 pounds and a better-than-
average passing and running attack,
the Pitt yearlings should be able
to extend any freshman aggregation

in the nation. Proof ‘of this came
last week when the freshman de-
-feated the Army plebes. Also the
fact that a strong Cincinnati Uni-
versity frosh had trouble defeating
the Ohio freshman, 7-0.

Various reasons are given by
the coaching staff and the players
for their early season successes.
Head coach Johnny Chickerineo
says, "The boys have been play-
ing with all the desire and deter-
mination to win." He adds that
his boys are a long way off from
being finished football players,
but they overcome this by playing 1
hard fort ball. '

‘Good Coaches’

Among the players, a standout
at tackle, Bill Priatko, gives as
his reason that "all the boys work
hard and together. There is a lot of
teamwork.”

Bobby Epps, a regular fullback
from Swissvale says that the rea-
son is simple. “There are good
coaches and good material and the

boys want to play ball.”

on Broadway, has the fairly ordinary
.plot of two small town sisters, Ruth

and Eileen, confronted with the

usual, along with the unusual, pro-
blems and situations of life in New
York City.

lt’s the unusual complications of
the usual story, of course, that make
the comedy.

Leads are Novices
Most of the main characters, in-
cluding the two leads, are played by
newcomers to the Foster stage, and
their relative inexperience takes
some of the gloss off the highly

' polished Fields-Chodorov dialogue.

This, coupled with disappointing
cuts in the script, could have turned
the Broadway comedy into a high
school farce.

Excellent character acting in the
supporting roles and expert techni-
cal effects tend to offset the weak
points, however, and the result is
still a well-w orth-seeing comedy.

Both Joan Reichman and Joan
Lisotto, cast as Ruth and Eileen
Sherwood, show flashes of excel-
lence, but the overall quality of
their performances indicates ability
still to be fully developed.

Mel Silver Good

Plaudits to veteran Mel Silver,
who, with little more than a walk-on
in the first act, still towers above
the other actors in this bit part.

Other supporting actors who
smooth out the rough spots and
brighten up the shadows are new-
comer Betty Klein, who resists the
temptation to overplay her role as
the suspicious Southern matron, and
Sue Delphey, who as the erring
Dixie daughter, also manages to

Pitt Players production of "My Sister Eileen” may not be the
most polished performance presented on the Foster Stage, but it
- is sure to be an entertaining show despiteits dramatic drawbacks.
The comedy, familiar to many theater-goers due to its long run

play this easily overdone part in a
capable manner.

The two most outstanding per-
formances, however, are given by
Ben Tafer as the simpering delica-
tessen manager, and by Del Demat-
teo, who plays the artist-landlord.

A large measure of credit goes to
the technical sta ff, particularly the
sound crew whose blasting effects
keep the auditorium literally rocking
throughoutthe play. Only one who is
intimate with the trials of sound
timing or who sat through the early
technical rehearsals can appreciate
the importance of the split-second
timing of the effects in this play.
The Players technicians have done
afirst-ratejob in this essentialfield.

The worst fault in the Players

‘Eileen’ Called Hilarious in Spots

By DICK KOVAR

production is the drastic and totally
unnecessary cutting of the script,
something over which Players evi-
dently had no control. The cuts were

made because the script has the 1

Southern belle, Helen, living in
unwedded bliss with her All-Ameri-
can sweetheart, the ‘Wreck.’ Such
cuts might be (just‘might be’) neces-

sary for a high school performance,
but are ridiculous when the audience
is of college level and above.

If the audiences of ‘Eileen’ make
some slight allowances for the more
inexperienced players and a major
allowance for the butchered script,
they should enjoy a full evening’s
entertainment -

  Tech A po l ogiaesfolr I n vos ion

Carnegie Tech has apologized for the recent "invasion” of
Pitt's campus by celebrating Tech students.

In an open letter to Pitt students, Arthur J. Christopher,
President of Tech’s Student Council, expressed regret at the
disturbance caused by a group of over 300 Tech enthusiasts who
stormed into the Commons Room last Monday while celebrating
their team’s victory over Case.

A similar apology was offered by the school’s administration.
In a personal telephone call to Dean of Men T.W. Biddle, Dr.
James Dickinson,Tech’s dean of men, said he was unhappy about
the behavior of the students, and hoped that such a thing would
happen again.

 November 1, 1950

To the students of the University of Pittsburgh:

On behalf of the Student Council of Carnegie Institute of Technology
I would like to take this opportunity to offer an apology for the manner
in which the regular classes were interrupted at the University of Pitts-
burgh last Monday morning by a group of students from Carnegie Tech.

I can assure you that our Student Council is taking steps to prevent
any further outbreaks. We are fully cognizant of the fact that such de-
monstrations might easily lead to more serious consequences, and we
are indeed thankful that no serious damage was inflicted last Monday.

It is only right, however, that Ipoint out to you, the students of the
University of.Pittsburgh, that the aforementioned demonstration was not
in any way sanctioned by the Student Council or other student groups on
the CIT campus and I believe that this fact should be stressed. Such
spontaneous gatherings are difficult to prevent at times but I assure you
that we are taking steps to prevent the recurrence of any such actions
on the CIT campus. L

We apprecia te the action taken by the Student Congress of the Uni:
versity of Pittsburgh to limit any such victory celebrations to your own’
campus and we will do our best to keep our part of the agreement.

In the hope that we may attain a closer feeling of respect and co-
operation I remain

Yours very truly,

Arthur J. Christopher, Jr.
President, Student Council

Carnegie Institute of Technology
