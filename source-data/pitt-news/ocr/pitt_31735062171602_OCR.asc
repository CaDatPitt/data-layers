"Prologue Progrmn’

Frosh O

by BILL (QORMLEY
News Editor

Later this week. the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences Council
tFASC) will consider a “Pro-
logue Program" for fresh-
men.that has been passed by
the College of Arts and Sci-
ences Council (CASC).

The program. which would be
open to as man_v as 300 College of
Arts and Sciences ICASI fresh-
men next fall. is "designed to en-
courage first-year students to de-
velop their desire to direct their
own learning.“

First recommended by the Arts
and Sciences Review Committee
IASRCI. which conducted hear-
ings on the subject last year. the
program has been in existence at
Antioch College in Ohio for sever-
al years.

FORMAL AND INFORMAL
STUDY

The Prologue Program propos-
al provides for 20 faculty mem-
bers to serve as “Tutors." It also
stipulates that» two upperclass
(‘AS students. chosen by the tu-
tors. are to assist each tutor. The
(.‘ASC is to select the tutors.

Students participating in the
program would recgjve 15 cred-

its per term for a maximum of
two terms. Their work would con-
sist of “a wide variety of formal
and informal types of study."

According to the CASC. the pro-
gram "does not challenge the
value of the basic academic dis-
ciplines. It shows. rather. a be-
lief that some students may come
to appreciate them more thor-
oughly. and even more rapidly. if
they discover a need for them by
starting from their own immedi-
ate intellectual and personal con-
cerns. and finding that these. pur-
sued with care and integrity.
brings them to wish to learn the
subjects universities teach."

In its report to the l<‘ASC. the
(JASC refrains from specifying
the nature of the studies that
might be pursued under the aegis
of the Prologue Program. be-
cause it is anxious for “individual
students to determine to a very
large extent their own program
of studies.” It does state. liow-
ever. that students participating
in the program would be able to
enroll in courses worth six credits
and audit other courses. as part
of their work.

PROGRAM’S GOALS

The announced goals of the Pro-

logue Program are:

Mortar Board Studies
Prospects For lVornen

by BOB GEDEKOH

Women graduate school appli-
cants who suspect that they are
subject to discrimination can ex-
plore their chances of admission
in a study recently published by
Mortar Board, the national senior
womens honor society.

Questionnaires were /sent to
each of the 11 professional
schools and 31 graduate schools at
Pitt and returns compiled.

The study notes that one area
which frequently was left unan-
swered in the questionnaire was
the attrition rate of women ver-
sus men in each school. The study
reports that this lack of informa-
tion “would warrant a hesitant ac-
ceptance of the claim that women
cannot be accepted in the schools
because of a tendency to termin-
ate prior to the completion of
their studies.”

The study indicates that "tradi-
tional fields of interest for wom-
en“ continue to draw the largest
number of female students. These
departments include Anthropolo-
gy. Classics. several Languages.
English. Speech and Theater Arts.
Library Sciences. Nursing. So-
cial Work and Education—each
maintaining an enrollment of 50
per cent or better female students.

ment of less than ten per cent
women include Business. Dental
Medicine. Engineering. Geogra-
phy. Law. Medicine. Physics and
l{eligion—fields which have tra-
ditionally been occupied by men.
The department with the smallest
percentage of female grad stu-
dents is Engineering. where wom-
en constitute only .51 per cent of
the total enrollment of 586.

The average QPAS of male and
female students accepted tended
to be relatively equal in most
cases. Generally the women ac-
cepted into science-related grad
schools had lower QPA’s than the
men, while the women accepted
into the grad schools dealing with
the arts and social studies had
higher QPAS than the men.

One of the exceptions to this po-
licy was the Medical School.
where the average QPA last year
for males accepted was 3.39.
while the average for females was
3.51. An even larger discrepancy
existed in 1968-69. when the aver-
age QPA for the accepted wom-
en was 3.6 compared to the men‘s
3.36.

On the other hand, the Depart-
ment of Social Work accepted
women with an average QPA .2-.3
below that of the men's averages.

Although one cannot clearly
evaluate the presence of discrim-
ination because of incomplete
and insufficient returns. the study
should be of great use to women
interested in applying to the vari-
ous grad schools here at Pitt.

It includes data on attrition
rates. student aid. average re-
quirements for acceptance and
enrollments for each of the de-
partments. All women interested
in applying to grad school may

contact the Advisory Council on.

ption Proposed

1) “The development of the nas-
cent intellectual and aesthetic in-
terests of the students:

2» "The fostering in each stu-
dent of a new intellectual and aes-
thetic interests;

3» "The development in each
student of the arts. of self-expres-
sion;

4: "The growth of each student
as a potential creator in the arts
or sciences. and

:3» "Increase of the students"
awareness of career opportuni-
ties consonant with their interests
and talents.“

Relying on “dialogue rather
than lecture” as “the principal
mode of interaction,” participants
in the program would be permit-
ted to work independently or as
part of a Prologue group.

A special committee. consisting
of the dean of CAS. representa-
tives of the tutors. representa-
tives of the student aides. and.
eventually. representatives of the
freshmen enrolled in the program
would be responsible for “deter-
mining procedures for assemb-
ling and recording evaluations“ of
the students" work.

Under the proposal. upperclass
student aides would receive CAS
credit for their work. normally no
more than six credits. Tutors
would be expected to teach no
more than one course per term.
while participating in the pro-
gram.

If approved by the l’ASC. the
Prologue proposal will be for-
warded to the l*‘acult_v of Arts and
Sciences (FASI. which must also
endorse it. The F.-\ t‘ is scheduled

to meet next month.

Ghetto Co-op Failures

EX1)lOI‘€(l by Dr. N ath  .
by TOM HEIPLE _ g . 2 
H Co-ops. through total community involvement. could be’the ‘ 
driving force necessary to uplift and change the ghetto into a de- - I
veloped community. Such is the belief of Dr. Raghu Nath. asso- 3 
ciate professor of business. who is the principal investigator of
a state funded project studying ghetto co-ops. I ’ - A
g The primary purpose of the study is to try and identify the leader- -
ship skills necessary in developing a successful co-op in a ghetto.
HIGH FAILURE RATE
Originally. the first phase of the program involved a comparative h
study of successful ghetto co-ops and those of white communities. In-”. '
stead. the team of investigators decided to explore in depth 11 ghetto
organizations. Dr. Nath explained that a comparative study would not
be advisable at this stage due to the matching problems involved. . V  _
Dr. Nath believes that since successful co-ops benefit the eiitire  
community and not just a few people, they shouldbe an obvious niléthod‘

of community organization. However, the failure rate of ghetto co-ops it 
is aboutfourin five.  “ 

 

   

The team of investigators has discovered that one season for the 
failures is that they were mostly small ventures involving only a hand-
ful of people and not the entire community. Dr. Nath emphasized that _.
success requires the full participation of the whole community. . I ‘ .

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT VITAL A

A second reason that the top-level leadership of a co-op gave little
consideration to involving the community. They failed to consider that -
the people of a ghetto. who may expect an immediate pay off. might
view the co-op with a great deal of.
suspicion when this pay off does
not materialize as expected. Dr.
Nath pointed out that educating_  ” ‘C
the people as to what a co-op is
and how it operates is one solution.

A third reason for the failures  “
of ghetto co-ops was that the co-op  9
leadership, by raising the hopes
and expectations of the people to
a high level and then failing ti) -
drastically change anything, caus-
ed the people supporting it to be-
come disillusioned and to with-
draw support. ‘ I

 

“The fantastic cooperation so ‘
far by the co-op officials was
much more than what we expect"
ed." claimed Dr. Nath. He said_
that in many instances, after the
interviews with the co-op officials I
were over. the officials would
send letters to the investigators 
containing information they had
not mentioned in the interview.
Apparently. the co-opofficials
share Dr. Nath‘s belief concern-
ing the full potential of such or-
ganizations.

 

Although phase one is going N
much slower than had been anti-
cipated, Dr. Nath believes the . 
time loss is made up by the in- I 
creased learning on-the part of
both sides. He -went on to explain
that it was_a two way process.»

“By going at their pace we get a
lot more inforir_1ation'.1The qual-
ity of the data bares this out. "

Although optimistic," Dr. Nath  .-

 ‘ The-,-Polite Conservative

 

 

 

‘w 1.

Donatelli Sells Soft

By BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Four years ago, Frank Donatel-

li was a “flaming liberal”. who

“thought Barry Goldwater was
-“some kind of a nut."

‘Today, he is state chairman of
the Young Americans for Free-
dom (YAF), a conservative group
founded ten years ago by William
F.-Buckley. Jr.

Donatelli, who resigned as
YAF’s Western Pennsylvania co-
ordinator last month to assume
the state chairmanship, is a sen-
ior Political Science major who
plans to go to law school next fall.
He has helped establish several
local YAF chapters, including one
at Pitt. He has risen quickly
through YAF’s ranks, acquiring
simultaneously the respect of
many who disagree strongly with
his views.

Easygoing and soft spoken,
Donatelli is the type of person
who rarely argues with passion
but who always speaks with con-
viction. He has a disarming pen-
chant for responding politely to
the stormiest of tirades——a prac-
tice that flusters opponents in de-
bate but also suits Donatelli’s gen-
tlemanly disposition.

Relying on a “soft sell" ap-
proach. Donateli has preached
the conservative gospel on num-
erous television and radio pro-
grams over the past three years.
Last summer. he worked as an
intern in Washington. D. C.. for
conservative Republican Senator
Paul Fannin of Arizona.

 IDEOLOGICAL
_ METAMORPHOSIS

Donatelli, who admist to get-
ting involved in the conservative
movement “by accident.“ was at-
tracted by conservatisms anti-
communism and its antipathy for
the “New Left.“ He remained an
apolitical Democrat. though. until
he read Godwater‘s Conscience of
a Conservative—a book that liter-
ally changed the course of his life
—in 1967.

Soon afterwards, Donatelli be-
gan to grapple with what he re-
gards as the central political
question of our age: “How do we
strike the proper balance between
liberty and order?”

On one extreme. he saw the So-
viet Union. which placed a pre-
mium on order. at the expense
of freedom. On the other. he saw

The Annual Bill of Rights
dinner of the American Civil
Liberties Union will be held
Tuesday, Dec. 15, in the SU
Ballroom. Joseph Rhodes, Jr.,
past president of the student
body at California Institute of
Technology, and the youngest
member of President Nixon's
Commission on Campus Un-
rest, will be the principal
speaker at the dinner. Reser-
vations can be made by phon-
ing the ACLU office, 521-
0170. The dinner-meeting is
open to the public.

“the total freedom of anarchy.
which in fact is no freedom at all."

Rejecting both solutions. he
also dismissed the ideas of 19th
century liberals. “They thought
it was possible to set up a totally
rationalistic government. with-
out paying attention to tradition
or culture." he observes. "They
thought that if only you change
society’s institutions. you can
change the nature of man.“

ANTI-COMMUNIST STRAIN

Donatelli emphasizes that the
conservative movement includes
people of diverse beliefs. YAF. he
Stresses. is the the same way. In
general. though Donatelli feels
that members of YAF have be-
come much more sophisticated
through the years.

“In the early ’60’s,” he ex-
plains, “anti-communism was
YAF’s guiding light. Today, the
New Left and the Communists are

regarded as co-menaces. In addi-

tion, our members are starting to
get concerned about economic is-
suesf’

Recognizing the pejorative con-
notations of “anticommunism.“
Donatelli quickly denies being an
hysteric. He also emphasizes that
he doesn‘t believe that commun-
ism today is monolithic.

“But." he adds. “just because
communism isn‘t monolithic does-
at mean it isn't aggressive. As a
matter of fact. I think ploycentric
communism is more of a danger.
it involves many foci of indepen-
dent power." '

Donatelli isn't disturbed by
communism “simply because its
an alien philosophy." He insists
that "it's the means communists
use to impose their views on the
rest of the world" which dis-
tress him.

GRASS ROOTS EMOTIONALISM

Beaming. Donatelli recounts
the progress of the conservative
movement. “At the 1968 Repub-
lican convention. we even had the
luxury of choosing between two
conservative candidates—Reagan
and Nixon." he gloats. And he
points to James Buckleys suc-
cessful campaign for senator in
New York as evidence of conser-
vatisms potency. YAF. inciden-
tally. played a major role in Buck-
ley‘s victory.

Donatelli concedes that conser-
vatism owes much of its popular-
ity to the “gut reactions” of Amer-
icans. He contends, however, that
“all the major turning points in

%%@%@@%%W%%M@@%@@@%@W

is

 

Y

  
   

American history have been the ’

result of emotions.” The New
Deal, for example, stemmed, in
his opinion, from the misery and
anger of the depression.

"You can’t rely on emotion
alone. though." Donatelli admits.
citing the abrasiveness of Vice-
President Agnews rhetoric as an
example. “Agnew's popular.” he
hastens to add. “but he's like the
first lieutenants who get out front
and charge. and who are most
likely to fall."

Donatelli believes Agnew has
sacrificed "any chances he ever
had of becoming President“ by
being outspoken and refusing to
remain “aloof from the battle."

A SYSTEM ‘FOR ALL SEASONS

Although he finds student apa-
thy “understandable." Donatelli
has little sympathy for his coun-
terparts on the Opposite end of the
political spectrum who have aban-
doned politics. "When you support
a system. you support it in all sea-
sons." he maintains. “As William
Buckley once said. ‘I don’t think
I‘ve ever voted for someone who's
won an election.‘ “

With more passion than usual.
he concludes. "This is the most
open society in man's history. To
throw it away simply because
your candidate loses an election
makes no sense to me.“

Once Donatelli gets his law de-
gree, his favorite hobby may very
well become his life’s work. “I
would like to go into politics, be-
cause I can’t see filling out wills
all my life,” he chuckles. “I don't
really have the stomach for elec-
toral politics. But I would enjoy
being a speech writer or a legisla-
tive assistant.”

Who knows‘? If articulate con-
servatives are rare. knowledge-
able but gentle ones are even
less common. The combination
could prove enough to guarantee
Frank Donatelli success as well
as respect.

(Editor's Note: A little less than a year ago, Harris Miller and Steve
Cundra vied for the office of Student Government president. It was a wild
campaign, and an even wilder election. Miller was elected and then un-
seated on a technicality. In the ensuing re-election, Cundra was elected
and himself unseated as a result of alleged campaign inconsistencies.
Eventually, Lenny Klavonic stepped into the vacuum and completed what
was, if_not the most bizarre SG presidential election, almost certainly the
last. The enactment of a new SG Constitution will divide the duties of the
president amoung four elected executives. Now, nearly a year after the
struggle that neither won, Miller and Cundra view SG, its past and its
future.)

forward,“ declared Harris Mill-

“Basically, I approve it it,"
Miller commented. “All of the

how structured, can't take care of
all the little details."

The new Consititution. recently
passed by student referendum.
calls for a four-man executive
board in lieu of a president. Crit-
ics have attacked the Constitu-
tion for one or both of two rea-
sons. Some feel that the Constitu-
tion gives too much authority to
the four executives and/or that it
makes provisions for an Alloca-
tions Committee that will not be
responsive to the needs of the stu-
dents.

Miller discounted the fear that
the Constitution could give the
commissioners too much author-
ity. He explained that a Constitu-

FALL TERM GRADES

Because of complications arising from converting to a new com-
puterized registration system, some students were not invoiced
for certain courses in which they are registered; consequently
grade cards were not produced for these and other students. Al-
though the system now has been corrected and is functioning well
for the winter term registration, a number of students will be put
to considerable inconvenience this term.

In order that all grades may be recorded properly, it is suggested ,.
that students check with their instructors to be sure that they have    
received grade cards for all courses, especially those for which   _ 1.-._;
they have not been invoiced.

When it has been determined that the instructor has not received a
grade card, the student should stop at the Registrar’s office, G-59,
Cathedral of Learning, and pick up a substitute grade card. Those
students who have been invoiced will be asked to present a, vali-
dated‘ invoice for the course in question. Students who have not
been invoiced for the course will be given an invoice for which pay-
ment will be due within one week.

 “Daddy,” I said rather demand-
ugly for a seven-year old “why
We always got to have black eyed
peas and hog jowls on New
Years.”

And ‘Daddy would patiently
explain as he did every year.
“Welleverything you do on New
Years Day, you do because you
Want good luck -the rest of the
year.‘ Black eyed peas are hard,
 you cook them till they get
soft, just the way you gonna work

en a hog rootin’, but when that
tihingwgets to plowin’ up a field
with his nose; lookin’ for- seeds
and stuff, it does a lot a damage.
And it won’t miss a seed or root-
iytbrings everything to it.”

~ Daddy said that we didn’t eat
chicken on New Years, because
when a chicken scratches in the
dirt for food, it sometimes scrat-
‘ches the food behind it. Then it
has to turn around, and by that
time another chicken scratching
behind it might have already
eaten the seed. “So you see," he
said, just like the hog rootin’,
you want to bring good luck to
yourself, especially on New
Years Day.

Daddy explained to me that the
first 12 days of January represent-
ed the 12 months of the new
year, and that you didn’t want
anything to}, happen to those
days which would jeapordize
your luck during the incoming
year.

“Ya got ta eat a little bit of cab-
bage‘ for dinner on New Years,"
he said trying to get me to finish
off the sauerkraut in my plate.
You want to have money this
year don’t you, and ain’t cab-
bage leafs green like money?“

Daddy never let anyone in the
house wash clothes on New
Years Day either, because he said
the dripping water from drying
clothes “would symbolize that
someone would be crying the
entire year over some catas-
trophe.

Plus he would never let the
first person to enter the house
on New Years Day‘ be anyone
but “good hardworking man."
which also symbolized a pros-
perous new year. -

I also remember times other
than New Years Day. though.
even after we had eaten all the
traditional “old southern things.
and made sure to act the right
way on New Years times when
the surplus food had run out.
the money was nil, and the gas
turned off. Then Daddy would
be trying to buy a little good luck
by going to sleep early to “dream
the number“ that he would play
the next day.

I remember the eerie glow
that the incense, Daddy was
burning for good luck, made in
the house. The house was dark-
ened, because of what we ex-
plained to the neighbors. was
a short circuit. But they knew
that a house darkened because
of a fuse or something blowing.
didn’t stay dark three or four

days. “Don‘t worry the incence

will bring us good luck," Daddy
said.

I got some of the worst ear-

beatings possible, for bringing

bad luck into the house by open-

 

ing an umbrella up inside of it,
or sweeping my brother’s feet
with. the broom; this sweeping

' bad luck on him.

I remember once at the dinner
table a piece of cornbread crum-
bled up into a large bowl filled
with buttermilk and sprinkled
with sugar. for my meal. I look-
ed up from the bowl, and a large
black spider was coming towards
me over the table. My Daddy
saw it too. and jumping up from
his seat, he killed it; put it into
a folded piece of paper. and stuck
it into my back pocket with the
words, “A spider crawling to-
wards you brings good luck.”

Black people have always had A

to rely on luck or chance for
prosperity. We were constantly
fooled into blaming extraneous
things for our misfortunes, since
our society denied us self—deter-
mination.

My Daddy didn’t really be-
lieve that all those things he
practiced could alter his pros-
perity.

But he had to turn to some-
thing, when he was denied the
opportunity to prosper by his
own powers. The superstitions
and rituals which he practiced
are only little escapes, when
the pressure of being Black in
the USA became too much for
him. Plus they were somewhat,
expressions of his undying hope
for the future.

Well Daddy- my generation of
young awakened Black people.
because you persevered so hard.
now know how to determine our
lives. and help you to determine
yours. You, and your supersti-
tions. myths. and rituals. are the
reason we know.

Happy New Year. Daddy!

Consultant, YMCA, Project Discovery

Because of where we find ourselves. the YMCA has expand-
ed into a project which tries to be an occasion for people to get
together again in some deeper ways. Project Discovery is like a
number of other projects. Centers, Institutes. and extentions of
Universities and organizations which are springing up around the
country to try not to persuade people. inform them. control them.
teach them, work them — but to try to provide special creative
occasions for people where they have the possibility of becoming
aware of what it means to be more human. personal. and com-
municating in their relationships and their organizations.

This upsurge has grown from the direction of a number of
persons in Psychology, Sociology and the Behavioral Sciences
who have been working on (since 1947) the implications of a
person-to—person approach to our social problems which stresses
what our society and organizations oppress: free occasions with
no age“-da where persons can take time with each other. and
through occasions for expressing themselves. exploring -their feel-
ings. and communicating can move towards more personalism.
where people function less around control, power. manipulation.
and status and more through community.

This has been called the sensitivity training movement. the
human potential movement. and many other names. Its main at-
traction is that itoffers alternatives to what people do not want
through means that are now forced but with the people.

People Oriented

The description of YMCA Project Discovery is specific about
the different occasions we are offering. The Project is not issue-
oriented. information-oriented. but like most of what the YMCA
does. focuses on the people where they are.

Project Discovery is getting together the facilitators and pro-
fessional consultants in the city who can be a resource in this
venture; «

Were also not interested in having “our own thing" and are
actively seeking to become a center of a circle, cooperating with
different Universities. Pitt organizations/, and hoping to expand
our "open to the public" invitation to a more active involve-
ment in the city. We are the only resourse of this type in the
city.

Specifically wecould move into the following areas:

a) elimination or reducing the cost of “creative occasions“
for people such as encounter groupskweekly encounter and crea-
tive expression groups. OPEN CIRCLE groups and experiences
such as mentor camp; without this. experiences like this have no
immediate future on the campus;

bl beginning more creative encounter occasions around spe-
cific human relationship problems, for example groups for cou-
ples. blacks and whites. members of a class and their teacher.
members of a specific organization with communication inter-
ests. professors and students, people of opposing interests and
points of View politically and socially;

c) utilize funds for the evaluation of the mentor program;
there are no funds presently to do this and really get around
what happened that persons liked; from this we might also get
insights into the" weaknesses of the mentor program and the new
possibilities for it in terms of group experiences;

d) organizing communication consultants and facilitators
for a creative consulting service which would be available to any
group on campus, for example, for a meeting between students
and police, for any number of meetings that go on where the
result has a lot to do with the communication going on between
people, for crisis situations where some form of conflict is block-
ing cooperation, for groups interested in communal living and life
styles who want facilitators to help them get together.

3) using some funds to begin student—faculty weekends
away in the country based on the belief that if we can commun-
icate person-to-person we can begin to move towards agreement on
less oppressive ways of learning;

f) setting up funds for members of the Advising Center who
are interested in Communication Workshops in order to let it be a
center more for person-to-person understanding from which could
come decisions about educational goals involved more freedom
for students; '

g) providing funds for limited research on the effect and
promises of peopleoccasions in other campuses around the coun-
try, so as to aid SG and the University in being more creative in-
facilitating relationships; ~

h) many other activities and special occasions which may
come up. -

Next Year

This term’s Discovery program has included several pro-
jects with the emphasis on communication. Six encounter group-
sensitivity weekends, several microlabs, and communications
workshops laced the term.

SST Defeat a First Step

Dear Editor:

Environmentalists around the
world were pleased to see the
defeat of the SST Appropriations
Bill in the United States Senate
on Thursday, December 3, 1970.
However, even though the re-
sponse of Pennsylvanians was
great when the call for tele-
grams to Senators Scott and
Schweiker went out, we can not
afford to stop here.

We probably won’t know if
the thousands of telegrams that
Senator Schweiker received help-
ed sway him to vote against
the SST, but no one knew how
he was going to vote until his
vote was. caste at 4:00 P.M. on
Thursday at the Capitol. Until
then, he was one of a few Sena-
tors who remained ‘uncommit-
ted’.

The fate of the SST is still
with the people and we must
continue our firm stand to pre-
vent the environmental degra-
dation that will follow the SST
if constructed.

The SST Appropriations‘ Bill
(asking for $290 million of tax-
payers money) has gone to a
joint committee consisting of a
group of Senators and Congress-
men. This meeting of the Confer-
ees is common practice when a
bill passes in the House and
then goes on to be defeated in
the Senate.

President Nixon and others
are applying as much pressure’
as possible to get federal funding
for the SST. The final decision
must however rest with the peo-
ple.

PLEASE send your personal
“public opinion telegrams?’ to
your U.S. Congressmen, Sena-
tors Scott and Schweiker urging
them to direct the conferees to
vote AGAINST THE SST!

The address of the Congress-
men is U.S. House of Represen-
tatives, Washington D.C. 20515
and that of the Senators is U. S.
Senate, Washington D.C. 20510.
Copies may also be sent to Sen-
ators Edmund Muskie, Gaylord
Nelson, and Jacob Javitz. Also
send copies to the Hon. Carl
Albert, House Majority Leader.
“Remember 15 words may be
sent for only $1.00 via Western
Union."

We must continue to take the
strong stand against the SST that
was illustrated by the 52-41 vote
against the $290 million appro-
priations. Our environment be-
longs to every man, woman, and
child .

For all of ours’ sake, direct
your opposition to the SST to
your elected officials.

 Vasect0my: An Alternative

The question of male sterilization or
vasectomy as a method of contraception
has been steamed in myth and misunder-
standing. In order to partially clear the
air, The Pitt News is printing an explana-
tion of vasectomy as prepared by the
national office of Zero Population Growth.

— Vasectomy is a medical operation
that sterilizes a man.

-— The operation is performed in a doc-
tor's office with only a local anesthetic.
It generally takes from 40 to 45 min-
utes.

— It involves the closing of two small
tubes which carry sperm~the vas defer-
ens.

— A small incision is made in each side
of the scrotum so that the tube can be cut
and tied off. thus blocking the passage of
sperm. This is essentially like cutting a
water hose and tying both ends. Nothing,
obviously, can pass through.

— The man will not be sterile however,

until all the sperm in the ampulla and
the remainder of the vas have either been
ejaculated or died of old age. This may
take from 4 to 6 weeks during which time
other methods of contraception must be
used. A semen sample must be taken to a
lab and receive negative verification for
sperm before the man may be considered
sterile.

— His male glands, the testicles, are all
still present and functioning normally.
Sperm and hormones are produced and
pass into the blood where they are ab-
sorbed as usual.

~ The man's sex drive is not affected
in any way. He has eractions and ejacu-
lates as normal.

—— No changes take place at all except
that the man does not have to worry about
producing more children.

— As a means of contraception, sterili-
zation is nearly 100% effective; The failure
rate is minimal.

Greek Story
Oversimplified

To the Editor,

Dr. Pollis‘ argument was in a
Pitt News of a few weeks ago
in effect that the government of
Greece (notice I said govern-
ment not junta like the Pitt
News) was run by sadistic re-
actionaries. She cited some ex-
amples that I was rather skep-
tical about.

She accused the government of
torture, but she failed to men-
tion that when a neutral party,
the Red Cross, investigated those
accusations, it came to the con-
clusion that those reports were
false. Another neutral group,
consisting of five British Parlia-
ment members from the three
different parties, came to the
detention camp with their own in-
terpreter and permission from
the government to speak to any-
one privately.

Again, the second neutral par-
ty came to the conclusion that
there were no tortures. An inter-
esting footnote to the camp pro-
gram is that it was created un-
der the previous democratic gov-
ernment and the laws used to de-
tain the occupants were crafted
under this same government.

In her argument she talked
about the Council of Europe,
and how the Council has been
telling Greece about democracy.
Yet Pollis seems to have forgot-
ten three of those countries‘ de-
mocratic practices in foreign
lands over the years.

England is very democratic in
England, but practically the only
time it granted true democracy
to the countries it controlled was

 
 
  
  
    
 
  
 
  
    

when it decided to no longer oc-
cupy those countries (ie. India,
Cyprus, and Rhodesia); remem-
ber England believed in apart-
heid ln Africa until it no longer
ruled it.

France is another country which
practices democracy solely in re-
spect to itself. If France so
strongly believed in democracy,
why didn’t they give this right to
Vietnam and the African nations
they once owned? Italy is an-
other fine example of democracy

-in action. When democracy fin-

ally came to Italy after World

War II, it had the “one new
government a year” formula
which is still plagueing Italy

today !

Yes, these three countries are
certainly justified in telling
Greece about the practice of
democracy!

Pollis also implied that cer-
tain acts of terror, such as bomb-
ings, have been employed by
Greece, and that these represent
the Greeks’ sentiment toward
their government. If this ‘Wer-
simplification is true, then the
bombings of police stations.in
America mean that the public
here hates the Police. Based on
this assumption, the Canadians
hate their government as exem-
plified by their acts of terror
toward that government.

If the Greeks really hated the
government that they have now,
then why did they not join the
king‘s_ “Democratic” counter
coup in 1967?

Throughout the argument, Pol-
lis screams Facist, while forget-
ting that Papandopoulous was
fervently fighting against the
Nazis at a time when it would
have been easier to fight with
them.

 

Page

5.4, 4-

   

Pollis goes on to describe the‘. 
threat of communism in Greece’
as absolutely ridiculous”. lAn
interesting footnote is that Pa-
pandopoulous fought against the

 

communists also.

The two reasons Pollis gave 4
for the continuous US. support
of Greece was that the Greece
was a vital link in the Nate‘
defense system, and that the gov-
ernment of Greece was making
an effort to change. Although  
she questions the first reason,-1;‘.
she mysteriously neglects the 
second explanation. I

gjgstudy of what to expect from drugs, dealers,

 off’'’.' This is ﬂusually done by’ snorting the ..

Psychological Addiction

Use of cocaine generally leads to a
severely introverted personality. and the
danger of psychological addiction is so
high that the user’s life is liable to cen-

,ter abnormally around obtaining and using

the drug.

Heroin is a morphine derivative, ori-
ginating in the poppy. Nearly all heroin
found in the United States is imported in
an already synthesized form. Like cocaine,

it is pressed into white powdery tablets.

which are usually split and cut before fin-
al sale. It is the most powerful drug per
unit weight or volume known with the
possible exception of LSD.

When heroin is shot directly into the
bloodstream. a sensation is produced which
according to its users can only be ade-
quately described in sexual terms. Regular
users have reported that shooting up is a
sensation similar to orgasm. albeit much
more satisfying.

One of the greatest dangers of heroin
use is that ones unconscious physical
mechanisms may be suppressed. to the
point sometimes where one would not
breathe if he did not actually remember
to breath. This is of.ten the cause for a
user OD-ing on the drug (overdose ).

In addition, there are the dangers of
hepatitis (from the use of unsterile nee-
dles) and collapsed veins. Furthermore. in
one’s first few experiences with it, over-
whelming feelings of nausea and cramps
are not uncommon.

There is also danger that the drug may
be cut with other ingredients. For exam-
ple, if it is cut with sugar to a high per-
centage, the user has a 50”} chance of liv-
ing. Continued use of heroin can lead to a
build up of CO2 in the muscles which
generates inordinate fatigue.

Writhing Withdrawal

The withdrawal symptoms connected
with heroin addiction are reason enough
to avoid it. It is a shattering experience to
see an addict who has been deprived of
heroin for a few days suddenly allowed to
inject it again - at one minute he writhes
in his bed amid his~own vomit and feces.
suffering perhaps from one of the worst
known physical sensations; half an hour
after injecting heroin. he or she may be
shaved. showered. dressed. laughing and
talking “normally”.

Heroin is generally sold in the Pitts-
burgh area in one to l‘2 gram bags at $75
a bag. Each bag is sufficient for three
“hits".

LSD. commonly called acid. although
not physically addictive. is by far the
most potent of the hallucinogens.

The initial effect is normally a sense
of some slight disorientation. followed by
a steadily increasing “strobe-light“ effect
due to prolonged after-images.

More intense feelings of disorienta-
tion usually develop as the user steadily
drifts further away from reality. and then
begins to experience bizarre visual ef-
fects. Common instances of these are
colorful geometric patterns across the en-
tire visual field. and movement of station-
ary objects due to some suggestive pat-
tern in their design.

Often the individual’s personality is to
a great extent reduced to its most basic
elements, and simple ideas may become
more complicated or significant. One sen-
sory impression may be translated or merg-
ed into another; for example, music may
appear as a color, and colors may seem to
haveataste.

the drug's effects comes when the per-
sons chemical balance‘ is thrown off. This
may happen any time within approximate-
1y 3 years of taking LSD.

Panic and Paranoia

Two other resulting dangers of the
drug include the panic a user experiences
upon discovering that he cannot stop the
drug's actions which leads to a fear that
he is losing his mind; and paranoia be-
cause the user may become increasingly
suspicious. feeling that someone is trying
to harm him or control his thinking.

Acid increases outward sensitivity to
other persons under the influence of the
drug. but. like amphetamines. it tends to
increase self-centeredness and neurosis.

Users can take LSD in a sugar cube.
pill (the most common form), paper, or
any other object impregnated with the
drug. Currently it is selling in Pittsburgh
on an average of $2-$4ahit.

Mescaline. a popular alternative to acid.
arrives on the scene in powder form at
$700 a pound. The pills. like acid. are al-
most always cut with speed. and some-
times flour. Approximately 1000 hits can
be derived from a pound and are sold at
about $4 a hit.

Many health-oriented and governmental
agencies have compiled statistics on drug
usage on campus. All have come to the
same conclusion: drug abuse is increas-
ing drastically.

Dr. Stanley Yolles. Director of the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health, stated
in a ‘Time. Guide to Drugs and the Young’
that “By the time adolescents become
college students. at least 25 to 40 percent
have at least tried some form of illegal
drugs.”

The statistics on drug usage once this
25 to 40 percent reach college conflict.
Marijuana and hashish are commonplace.
Estimates suggest that from 60 to 90 per-
cent of students will have tried it before
graduation.

At the Lniversity. the Student Health
Service is unable to make generalizations
concerning campus drug usage. since it
only receives an occasional case of the
bum trip. the speed freak. or addict. Dr.
Joseph Hinchcliffe. Director. states that
one case of hard drug usage per month
is "unusual.“

Student Estimates

In the face of the dearth of formal sta-
tistics here. individuals were questioned
on their knowledge of the extent of hard
drug usage on campus. These are opin-
ions. however. and cannot be taken as ab-
solute truth.

Maureen G.: "I'd say one in a hun-
dred have skin-popped or snorted herion.
I‘ don't know of any shooting up. but
there might well be. Cocaine there's more
of the mescaline even more. Nothing like
grass or hash. but its here."

Robert B.: “There's lots of acid float-
ing around and I suppose one in a hun-
dred. maybe more. are doing it. Lot's of
people were doing psylocibin last year-
think it‘s safer — but it's really tight now."

Laura C.: Most people I know speed
a little — to study. write papersjget through

finals."

The main reason suggested for the

‘Health Centers lack of statistics is that

most students “stick together." preferring
to help one another instead of consulting
“outsiders." There is a general fear that a
blacklist may be kept and that users may
be turned over to the authorities 4 -be‘ they
police; parents, or administration.

Pat Gaylord. head nurse at the Student
Health Service. said that most students
users eventually call their parents. but
there's no pressure from the agency. She
stressed the confidential policy and the ad-
vantage of followup help that is lacking
in hospital emergency wards.

For Help

Other organizations that will supply
similar information and health services
in the Oakland Area include Student

Both Federal and State laws deal with
drug usage. In the Community Leader
Handbook, from WQED. Dr. Lee H. Gold-
berg surveys Pennsylvanias pertinent laws
on drug abuse. "The most important Penn-
sylvania law relating to the sale and use
of drugs is the Drug Device and Cosme-
tic Act enacted in 1961 . . Everyone
should be alerted to the fact that mari-
juana is defined under the act as a ‘nar-
cotic drug.‘

Convictions related to marijuana carry
with them the same penalties  those re-
lating to ‘hard drugs‘ — heroin. morphine.
opium. The following table appeared in
the same study.

THE UNIVERSITY Varsity Marching Band presented its 24th Annual Stadi-
um Review on Wednesday, Dec. 2, at Carnegie Music Hall. The band fea-
tured music from its home and away half-time shows presented through-
out the 1970 football season. Selections from time-outs and post-game
shows were also played.

Jim Biber, the Pitt Panther, was featured in a number entitled The
Panther Song, and the cheerleaders were featured in Windy and The Horse.

Midway through the concert plaques were presented to the director
of the University Bands, Robert L. Arthur; assistant directors Dr. Jack An-
derson and Dr. Richard Obrycki, and to graduate manager George Vance
to commemorate the occasion.

is another matter.

Carballido’s play takes place in
Mexico. The town people move
back and forth carrying on their
life activities and with the help of
a narrator—we learn bits and
pieces of their lives-—-just enough
to separate one from the other.

High School is the story of North-

but it could easily be the story of
any white. middleclass high in the

The film. which was shown at

‘David Lawrence Hall on Thurs-

day evening. was produced and di-
rected by Frederick Wiseman in
an absurdly underhanded way.
Teachers were told that they were
being filmed in order to compare
East and West Coast high schools.
Instead. the film centered on the
inadequacies of the American edu-
cational system.

A series of confrontations be-
tween student and teacher showed
the teachers to be narrow minded
and unfeeling. In one instance. a

    

the towns people unite as one to
avenge the death of the small
child.

Dona Christina la member of
the upper classt claims the death

the local authorities (the upper

class). Yet there is rebellion by

the townspeople—- Dona Christina

 is taken off to jail~and then grad-

boy showed his gym teacher a doc-
tor's excuse saying that he could
not participate in gym class. i

The teacher, an enormous hulk
with a foghorn voice, said that the
boy had to dress for class and the
teacher would decide if the boy
were fit to take gym. The student
had about as much say so in the
matter as a deaf mute.

Neither the teacher nor the ad-
ministration gave reasons tor the
punishments incurred on a stu-
dent. A vice-principal justified a
detention by saying. “We want to
establish that you can be a man
and you can take orders." Some-
how. I suppose. he was trying to
establish a strong link between
masculinity and taking orders.

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks itstrue identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE.

A MOVING SCENE from the Studio Theatre's final production of the year.

In this town for a while there
was a short days anger. There are
tinges of class distinction and in-
equity of treatment by the law be-
tween rich and poor and so on-
but in effect this is about the size
of  . . Anger."

In his attempt to establish a
basis for action in this story. Car-
ballido is not too successful. What

the whole thing amounts to is '

many bits and pieces tied together
and in many instances not very
well. There is a little bit of every-
thing but not enough. especially in

rustrations

were closer to a master-slave re-
lationship than anything else. He-
spect for authority was demand-
ed. yet there was no mutual re-
spect. Students were non-entities.
As a result students believed that
they were nothing.

A former student wrote a letter
to the principla of the school just
before being sent into battle in
Vietnam. He said that he was not
afraid of death, that his body was
no more than a “target” to be
used by the government and that
this was the way in which he could
serve his country. Education fos-
ters these attitudes. The bo_v felt
that he was nothing because he
was taught that he was nothing.

instead of some depth in the story
line—there is little more than
shallow representation of a very

‘thin story.

In essence, motivation was
weak and unsubstantiated, leav-
ing us to base our reactions on
what the narrator had to tell us—
and that is mighty flimsy stuff.
What we end up with is little sub-
stantiation for the forces which
supposedly carry the townspeople
into riot and revenge—leaving lit-
tle feeling for what the whole
thing is about.

the play is little more than light
soap opera ——after that point some
rather low key "l’eyton Place"
melodrama. Short Days Anger
might well have been better told
on one side of the program.

Bert Nemitz directs a huge cast
with skill. He has taken a show
obviously written for a l’roscen—
ium stage and done very nicely
in adapting it for the Studio
Theatre.

The cast was outstanding in
some instances and mediocre in
others. Those deserving special
mention are Betty Rothbart as
Dona Christina, Rick Applegate.
Richard Jakiel, Joe Rossi. Fran-
cine Nemitz and Robb Gerard. all
of whom turn in fine portrayals in
major roles.

In minor roles Kathy l)evka.
Sally Booker. Wayne ltyback.
Christ Wendt. (‘asey Schulberg.
Dennis Grossman and Charlie
Walter handled their roles quite
nicely.

Dr. George Bogusch as l)iodoro
showed himself to be. quite adept
as an actor. delivering an inter-
esting portrayal as the town idiot.

Technically this production was
quite saperior—-with the exception
of the lights which were at best
sufficient. Len Feldmans set was
an outstanding construction»one
of the best I've seen at Sutdio The-
atre. Lynne Hemingways cos-
tumes were quite nicle_v done.
Very effective use was made of a
number of slides for the show also.

The Heinz Chapel Concert Choir
began the Christmas season for
those people who packed the
Chapel this Sunday. Dec. 6. The
choir. directed by Paul D. Ander-
son. performed selections ranging
from Bach to Appalachian folk
spngs.

In deep violet robes. the men
and women walked to the altar
singing “Good Christian Men. Re-
joice," from 14th century ‘Ger-
many. After the processional. they
utilized an echo choir in the choir
loft to good effect for the next two
selections.

The first, an early American
fuguing tune. was a springy, im-
patient tune entitled “How Long.
Dear Savior, How Long.” The sec-
ond used an echo chorus for
“Shout and Be Joyful. All Ye
Lands.“

The choir then split and waited
in the lateral pews as Robert S.
Lord, the University organist,
played the somber “Chorale Pre-
lude on Nun” by Johann Sebastian
Bach. After a brief pause, he went
on to the more lively French piece
by L. C. Daquin, “Noel Grands
Jeux et Duo.” By switching from
speakers to the pipes for the light-
er section, Mr. Lord created a
very airy effect.

This airiness was quickly dash-
ed as the choir brought in a more
serious note with “Verbum Caro
Factum Est" by Hans Leo Hass-
ler.

A brief interlude. rustling pages
and the organ led the choir into
that most famous song of praise.
"The Magnificat in D" as writ-
ten by Bach. The 12 sections were
performed alternately by soloists.
duets. trios and the full choir.

Maintaining the strong tempo
set by the Magnificat, the organ-
ist played a fast-moving piece by
Bach, “Toccatta and Gague in D.”

Director Paul D. Anderson then
took the choir off on an interna-
tional theme introduced with the
"Paiute Cradle Song" from the
American Indians arranged by
Victor Landau. With only a flute
for sporadic accompaniment.
they softly went into a Chinese
peasant song, “The Moon and
Stars of Christmas."

with ,4 /m tall 6/tristmzzs €0I1£’c’t’f

“In the Bleak Mid-Winter" by
Gustav Holst brought a slight
taste of Germany to the chapel.
Reflecting the simplicity of our
own Appalachian’s folk beliefs
was the lullaby-like “Jesus, Jesus.
Rest Your Head." Next came--a
rather majestic piece with the
organ by Louis Bourgeois entitled
“All People That on Earth Do
Dwell.“ The choir moved quickly
from “Lord. Now Lettest Thou
Thy Servant“ to the Finale.

Director Anderson stationed
himself at the lectern urging ev-
eryone to rise and sing as he led
“O. Come All Ye Faithful." The
chapel responded with all four
verses of that most popular carol
muffling the footsteps of the choir
as they filed out down the center
aisle.

°"°°Five Easy Pieces”‘**r

by PAT O'BRIEN

Jack Nicholson grins on the
Newsweek cover while inside the
editors tell us that films like Five
Easy Pieces are “acting out a
search for a better way to live"
and that heroes like Bobby Dupea
are “most often losers whose
heroism is measured not in their
ability to triumph but to survive.“

Elsewhere in the same maga-
zine Melvin Laird insists that the
POW mission “was not a failure.
. . . This mission was.carried on
by a group of men that performed
with 100 per cent excellence.”

Measured in terms of what the
film attempted. giving us a pic-
ture of a contemporary American
searching for meaning, Five Easy
Pieces is a notable achievement.
Measured in terms of what the
film delivers, it is failure. Like
the POW mission, the entire pro-
ject was based upon faulty intelli-
gence.

Neither screenwriter Carol
Eastman, nor star Jack Nichol-
son, has a clue to the sources of

campaign arguments was that
there was a need to restructure
the Constitution so that more
people could get involved, but it
still is the way it was in the past.

The former candidate doesn’t
blame any particular person or
group for the lack of student par-
ticipation. He feels that perhaps
the situation may be a result of
disinterest on the part of the stu-
dents.

“Lenny Klavonic (SG presi-
dent) didn’t deserve the criticism
he received for the lack of con-
certs,“ Miller stated. “It wasn't
the fault of one individual. Klavon-
ic should have said ‘let's get to
work.‘ instead of making prm-
ises.”

Miller was referring to the
criticism Klavonic received for
not getting the “Concert-a—Month
Program” off the ground.

Miller expressed hope that the
students will look for leaders
“who will seek problems and find
solutions to them, not just meet
crises and set up concerts.

“Too many times politicians
say. “I have X, Y, Z priorities."
Miller complained, “To hell with
their priorities."

At present, Miller is serving on
the University Senate Plant and
Utilization Committee. He is con-
templating involvement in the
improvement of election proce-
dures next term.

(Continued from Page 3)

tion only formalized on paper
what already existed."

The former head of the United
Student Coalition asserted his pes-
simism regarding the effective-
ness of SG and blamed the organ-
ization’s failure on student apa-
thy. “Few people know what SG is
doing or want to get involved, and
even less care.” Cundra argued.
He pointed out that the small
group of students that are active
in SG can easily become disen-
chanted with the red tape neces-
sary to produce reform.

Using the Liberal Arts Cabinet
as an example, Cundra explained
that “the students involved last

year didn’t receive headlines for
their work, which included re-
search, faculty meetings, and a
lot of hurdles.”

In Cundra’s opinion, the still
born “Concert a Month" program
could be one method of attracting
more qualified students to SG. “If
SG could book groups like Crosby,
Stills. Nash. and Young, students
would realize the potential power
of SG and the money that is avail-
able,” he asserted. “Then they
might become interested in what
SG is doing and want to get in-
volved.”

Cundra seems to think, how-
ever, that students are moving
away from involvement in social
issues and student organizations.

9W SC’ Cundra Sees Transition; 5',

“The campus as I see it is under-
going a big transition. Only a few
groups like the Commuter Asso-
ciation are presently organizer
now. and the wants of students
are changing."

Cundra feels that “more stu- .
dents are going back to academ- p

ics because they are realizing that

they came to college for an edu- ,?
cation, and that education is one 

thing that can't be taken away."

A course titled Hebrew Mys-
ticism, sponsored by Dr. Myron
Taube of the English Depart-I
ment, will be offered during
the Winter Term. The course g
will be taught by Rabbi Borris ‘
A. Rackovsky, director of the
B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation.

The course will explore the l
history of Jewish Mysticism
from 1150 through the 19th
century, its general character-
istics, and the development of
the Hasidic (Jewish sect in-
volved in Mysticism) and Mes-
sianic movements.

Evaluations will be based on
a paper and class participation.

Student interested may con-
tact Rabbi Rackovsky (621-
8875), Dr. Taube (ext. 354) or
their advisor. The expected é..-
rollment is 30. -

In View of our recent exposure to the Joe Namath
film C. C. and Company, we the undersigned. feel
compelled to voice our opinions on this picture. The
great enthusiasm that we are forced by the conviction
to express is in itself indicative of the tremendous
power that we believe to be inherent in this film. Joe
Namath presented a sterling performance worthy of
praise even if coming from a top-notch veteran actor.
but also displaying the charisma and magnetism that
can stem from nothing short of an extremely high
degree of innate charm. Combining this greatness
with the many talents of Ann-Margaret—beauty.
charm. activing prowess. and sex appeal. to mention
only a few—could result in no less than a film
abounding with the merits of acting par excellence.
These qualities alone would make any picture into a
movie-goers’ delight. but its values are able to
transcend even those just cited. The team of Joe
Namath and Ann-Margaret is exemplary of a warmth
and rapport of interpersonal contact that is essential
in motivating maximum audience involvement in a
dramatic presentation and presently unmatched in the
motion picture industry. All of this plus a great. well-
written. and well-cast story story that presents a very ,
humurous and clever portrayal of life today makes C.
C. and Company an unforgetable. incomparable. and
very funny film masterpiece.

To Whom It May Concern:

Those who would attempt to limit the merits of
the above evaluation will be sadly disappointed to find
that our views are in accordance with those of
virtually all film critics. Wanda Hale of the New York
News and Crisby of the Times, as representative of
two of Americas journalistic giants. have both
lauded the merits of C. C. and Company. Arthur
Knight of the Saturday Review, and the critics of Life,
and countless others have also added their compli-
mentary opinions to the consensus of the mass media.
After viewing the film. unfavorable reviews. even
though few and far between. can only cause us to
shake our heads or shrug our shoulders in utter
amazement. disbelief. and indeed shock.

It is our opinion that C. C. and Company is a
unique film that presents an excellently balanced and
coordinated blend of humor and drama which carries
an emotional whollop lacking in most films. It was
indeed this characteristic of the film that instilled
within us the desire—or was it a complusion—to
present our views and reactions with regards to it.

And it is our sincere hope that the contents of
this letter will both serve to inform those of the
viewing public who have yet to hear of C. C. and
Company of its merits and that the film will receive
sufficient exposure so that the many who desire to
View it may do so. 46 Concerned Citizens

Inhis study of what he has terni—

trated the hard shell image of
the men in blue with the aid of
fades from sharp to soft focus and
a series of symbolic red flashing
lights.

first of the film makers to utilize

"Room Service” Opens at Playhouse

L

Becze Shines In

by BOB BONN

What has been termed “a stage classic. an age-
less comedy for the repertory of the future“ is en-
joying its 35-year birthday in a one-month stand at
the Playhouse.

Room Service, written in 1935. is a inane farce.
centering on a group of actors in a hotel room as
they whee-land deal with financial troubles. trying
to get a show started. They nearly get evicted when
they find a backer. hit the stage. and are an instant
success and everyone lives happily ever after.

The Playhouse production features four veteran
actors in the major roles: Ken Costigan as Gordon
Miller. the director of the proposed play: Eddie
Steinfeld as Faker and Val Mayer as Harry Binion.
two of Miller's assistant; and Pitts William Becze
as Leo Davis. the author of the proposed play.

Of the four, it unquestionably was Becze who
gave the best performance. His portrayal of a con-
fused, shy, naive, and dumb kid from the sticks
was nearly perfect as he stuttered, shouted, and
tripped his way through some well-timed and con-
vincing acting. .

;\layer and Steinfeld also turned in good per-
formances. as did hotel manager Joe Schad. These
characterizations were not nearly as strong. how-
ever.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the acting
was in that of the lead character. played by Costi-
"an. Now. although much of the comedy in Room
Service comes from the obvious over-acting of all
the characters. Costigan seems to be too self-con-
scious and too serious to successfully pull off the
plays man_y gags and punchlines.

Perhaps this can be credited to the age of the
play. opening night roughness. or what have you.
but certainly more could be expected of the Play-
houses associate producer and former Broadway
actor.

Also disappointing was the lack of an outstanding
performance in a cameo role. Several potentially
good supporting parts were played by Collette Di
Giosio, Herman Sadwick, Joh Dorish, and John-
Lindsay McCormick, but none of these came close
to realizing their full possibilities.

All of the acting was adequate and competent
enough to get by. however. and Becze managedgto
keep the slightly dragging action going. The entire
cast was handicapped. however. by the play itself.

 

I name Farce

O

BILL BECZE (left) plays the role of an aspiring play-
wright and Val Mayer, plays the would-be director in
one of the episodes from Room Service at the Play-
house in Oakland now through Jan. 3.

Room Service was once done on film by Marx
Brothers. who really would be better at handling
this sort of thing. And there was simply no way for
a Playhouse—based performance to solve the prob-
lems basic to the play.

It is too old. too many of the jokes are now con-

sidered trite. and too many of the situations are too
well—worn to keep the interest of today's viewers.

In fact. watching Room Service continually re-
minded this reviewer of watching Jackie Gleason on
The Honeymooners.

And although the opening-night audience gave the
cast a respectable applause at the end, it is the feel-
ing of this reviewer that Room Service. the Play-
house’s 362nd production, is not up to par.

But then. I

The grapplers employed some
down-to-earth tactics to trounce
Kent State, 32-6, Saturday and
put their season record at 2-0.

“We weren’t so good on our
feet, but we were better on the
mat,” stated coach Dave Adams.
“We also out-did them in take
downs.” =

Pitt chalked up twelve take
downs in addition to four pins.
The Golden Flashes scored only
seven take downs and no pins.
Only one man picked up riding
time points for Kent.

Adams was a little disappoint-
ed at the lack of falls against
Maryland, in the grapplers op-
ener, but he had no reason to
complain after the Kent match.

Randy Payne and Bob Kuhn,
both All-Americans, scored pins
against Kent.’ Payne, at 126,
toppled Hale Richmond in 1:38.
And Kuhn, who was trailing
George Paulus 6-3, reversed his
opponent and pinned him at 5:40.

‘Wisconsin

Tomorrow

By JERRY MYERS

The Panthers return home to-
morrow night to battle the Bad-
gers of Wisconsin in the Fitz-
gerald Field House at 8 p.m. -
in their last game before finals.

Keying a Badger offense that
has.averaged over 100 points in
their first two contests of the
1970-71 season, will be 6-1 sen-
ior guard Clarence Sherrod. Sher-
rod was 48th in the country in
individual scoring last year, av-
eraging 22.4 points per game,
stretching over a 24-game sea-
son. The Badger field-general
was also 19th in the country in
free-throw percentage, sinking
168 of 202 attempts from the
charity line for a percentage



“Wisconsin is a very power-
ful team offensively,” comment-
ed Panther Coach Buzz Ridl.
“They are physically strong, and
I expect them to press us all over
the court. So you’ll see the same
kind of defense as Fordham
threw at us.”

At the same time, Ridl is very

. glad to be back in Pittsburgh and

playing before a partisan crowd.
“Being at home with our 'own
fans certainly helps the team,”
Ridl said.

In addition to Sherrod, the
Panthers will have to watch two
sophomores from New York, 6-4
Leon Howard and 6-6 Gary Wat-
son. Howard averaged 29.9 points
for the Wisconsin freshman squad
one year ago and Watson tallied
a 23.8 average. Both are forwards
and will flank 6-6 pivot-man,
sophomore Pat Rohan.

Bob Frasor, a 6-1 junior, will
be at the other guard position
alongside Sherrod, making the
Badgers a relatively young
team, but with the experienced
Sherrod directing the attack.

The loss of three 6-8 men
leaves Badger coach John Pow-
less with a definite height prob-
lem. He will be forced to go with

if his 6-6 sophomore at center and

I has no one tailer. The addition of
the sharp-shooting forwards fits
nicely into the Badger offense

The heavy weights also contri-

At 177, Willie Saloky flattened
Brant Harland in 4:58. Craig

ned Dave Carmony at 6: 27.

John Chatman had three near
falls in the 158 pound match.
“We felt, that some of them
should have been pins,” Adams
said. Chatman won an 18-2 de-
csion.

At 42, Bud Smeltz lost a 9-4
decision to two—time Mid-Ameri-
can Conference champion, Don
Milkovich. Milkovich also beat
Smeltz in the nationals last
year.

KENT SCOTT
Back In Form

  

Kent picked up another three
points when Tim Whittaker de-
cisioned Jim Tate 7-3.

“I knew Smeltz would have
problems,” commented Adams,
“And Tate needs experience. Its
been tough for him, but he’s
coming along.

Steve Weiss, Dave Wylie and
Jim Caramanna won decisions.

Adams has been fortunate as
far as injuries are concerned.
Though Dave Young has been
sidelined with a shoulder separ-
ation, Adams has a good replace-
ment in the heavyweight spot.
Bob Kuhn also has been having
shoulder trouble. However, it
hasn’t kept him out of the line-
up. According to the coach, his
injury is not serious.

Adams has been very happy
with the team’s progress so
far.

“I’m pleased with everybody,
he said. “Everyone has the right
attitude and a winning spirit.

 

 

We’re looking forward to the
big one.”

The big ones for Pitt’s grapp-
lers this year are the District -2

pionships, but currently the
matmen will have to wait until
January 9 for their next match.

College basketball tradition
claims that the ‘home-court ad-

playing in its own field house,
and the Fordham Rams cashed
in on this factor as they upend-

Robert _Morris
Outp lays Cubs

by MARTY HELLMAN

The freshman basketball team found out what it was like to be
on the short end of a rout on Saturday night against Robert Morris
Junior College. The Colonials crushed the Panther Cubs, 86-55, be-
fore a capacity crowd at RM John Jay gymnasium.

Led by Ron Hightower, the Colonials jumped to an early 21-8
margin in the first half and then proceeded to steadily increase the

advantage for the rest of the game.

Hightower, who won a start-
ing position on the basis of his
performance against Butler Com-
munity College earlier in the
week, proved too tough for the
frosh in all departments.

Besides his game high total
of 17 points, he paced all re-
bounders with‘19. He also har-
rassed the Cubs’ offense by
blocking several shots.

“Hightower did a real good
job,” commented Cub Coach
Tim Grgurich. “In fact their
whole team just outhustled and
outplayed us.”

Several of the Cub starters got.

into early foul trouble. Mickey
Martin, top scorer in the first
game against Pitt-Greensburg,
got his fourth personal in the
opening minutes of the second
half and fouled out with only
six minutes gone, with just 8
points.

Ken Wagoner also left the-

game due to fouls early in the

: second half.

Gary Pagano, the Cubs’. sixth

man, came off the bench midway ,

   

through the first half and wound
up as the leading scorer with 14
points. He hit on long jump
shots, and at one point was 4-4.

CUBS IN ACTION

Cubs must rebound against
Duquesne freshmen. see page 17.

“Gary did real well,” said
Grgurich. “He sparked us a little
bit when we still had a chance
to get close.”

Robert Morris dominated the
boards both offensively and de-
fensively, outrebounding the
frosh 57-37. Johnathan Marshall
and Jim Daschield backed up
Hightower, while Jim Bolla was
high for the Cubs with 13.

“We were throwing a lot of
chances away,” stated Grgurich,
referring to the squad’s 24 turn-
overs. “We just didn’t play up
to our potential although I felt
we had a good chance to beat
them before the game.” a 7

  (39-26).;

highlighted by a series of shift-
ing momentums.»

“The players were upset by
the early fouls,” commented Pitt
Coach Buzz Ridl. “The players
were a little hesitant to shoot,
and the younger players were es-
pecially upset by the noise of
the crowd and being away from
home.”

At the same time Ridl applaud-
ed his team for a “tremendous”
comeback that saw them turn a
Ram lead of 16 points (13:28
left in the game) into a Panther
lead of two points, eight min-
utes later.

“I was really pleased with the
way we came back in the sec-
ond half,” Ridl said. “We could
have beat them. If the game had
been played at home I’m sure
we could have won.”

Ridl then commented that the
comeback gave the Panthers
confidence and it indicated to
him that the team could recover
from a large deficit and regain
the lead. The disadvantages con-
nected with playing away is
something, “we’ll have to grow
with as the season goes on,” he
said.

Early foul trouble and an un-
yielding Ram press were the two
big Panther problems. With less
then four minutes gone in the
contest both Mike Paul and
Paul O’Gorek had three personal
fouls, and Fordham was in the

one-on-one situation _ from the
charity stripe.
Fordham went into a full-

court pressing defense almost
immediately. The "Cats lost the
ball only once as a direct result
of the tight defense, but the
added pressure forced a large
number of turn-overs.

“I think the quotes about the
press were exaggerated." said
Ridl, referring to the comments
on the radio broadcast back to
Pittsburgh of the contest. “We
only lost the ball once in the
first half as a result of the press,
and that was a ten second vio-
lation. On the other hand, be-
cause of the press we got some
easy baskets that we wouldn’t
have had otherwise.”

Fordham took —a 13-point lead
into the locker room at halftime

{The Panther _¢ar_ne_out  " 7

in the second half, cut the lead
to eight on a field goal by Kent
Scott of the fast-break, but then
the Cats faltered. Fordham slow-
ly picked up the momentum and

surged to a 49-33 bulge scoring»;

ten of the next eleven points.”

The, Panthers then reversed
the onslaught, with Ken Scott
popping on three straight field
goals. Mike Riggle hit a hook
shot and Scott put in a 15-foot
jumper and followed with a
twenty footer. Downes scored on -
a lay-up, and the Panthers trail-
ed by four. Two minutes later
Morris layed the ball up for a
field goal that gave the Panth-
ers their first lead 55-53 since t-K3’
opening moments of the contest.

At this point the last shift in
momentum occured, spurred on
by a charged-up field house of
Ram fans. Fordham coverted two
three-point plays and forced
the Panthers into off—balance
shots. The next five minutes
spelled disaster for the Cats as
the Rams went on to score 17 of
the last 20 points.

By the last part of the second
half the mounting foul problems
started to take their toll on the
Panther starters. Mike Paul foul-
ed out with 5:37 left, followed
by Carl Morris (4:34), and Bi”?
Sulkowski (2:41). Tom Sulliva“
and Bart Woytowicz fouled out
for the Rams.

Chuck Yelverton, Fordham sen-
ior guard lead all scorers with 18
points. Kent Scott regained the
form that enabled him to lead
the Panthers in scoring last year,
pouring in 17 points Saturday
night, with only three of them
coming in the first half.

Carl Morris was the next high-
est Panther scorer with 11 points.
The fact that starting center
Paul O'Gorek failed "to put the
ball through the hoop at all,
and Mike Paul only had 2 points.
added to the Panther woes.

“I think our main problem was
that we didn’t settle down well

enough in the first half," Rid}--.,a
said. “We’ll have to pick up]

our defensive rebounding. They
got a lot of easy baskets on 2nd
and 3rd shots. But I hope that

Pitt's injury riddled gymnastics team traveled to West Point to
avenge last year's defeat to Army only to be turned back 136.85-
127.40 by the Cadets superior numbers.
by MARTY HELLMAN

"Army had five men in every event but side horse where they had
only four men.“ Pitt Coach Warren Neiger said. “We only had three
men in both the rings and the horizontal bar and only five in the free
exercise. Afther the eight hour car ride to West Point they were a lit-

tle tired. too."

Pitt managed one first. three
seconds and two thirds after the
ordeal.

Lowell Meek accomplished the
ighest score of the meet, 9.1, and

‘also copped the free exercise

event for Pitt’s only first place
finish.

Richard Pribis and Dave An-
drews placed fourth and fifth
with respective scores of 7.7 and

that has already proven that they
can score, and score big.

“Wisconsin has scored over 100
points in their first two games."
said Ridl. “We know they're not
tall but we expect them to be
N. .ry well-built physically."

Through the ye_ars Pitt has had
a lot of trouble with Wisconsin
teams. The over-all season dates
back to 1928 when Wisconsin
won 34-24. The teams have met
11 timeswith Wisconsin captur-
ing eight of those contests to the
Panthers‘ three. The last time
the two teams met was in 1964-
65 when Wisconsin triumphed
80-63.

Cub Coach Tim Grgurich is hoping that the freshman basketball
team will be able to rebound after Saturday night‘s crushing defeat to

the Robert Morris Colonials in time to face cross town rival Duquesne ‘

frosh tomorrow evening.

The little Dukes enter the game with a 2-9 record. while the Cubs

now stand at 1-1.

“We'll just have to pull ourselves together." stated Grgurich.

“We‘ll have to learn from our mistakes from that game."

Leading the Dukes will be 6-9
Lionel Billingy from New York.
Coach Al Bailey of the Bluffites is
very high in praise on him.

“He could be the greatest cen-
ter in Duquesne history." said
Bailey.

Grugurich realizes Billingy‘s
strength. “He is very quick and
extremely well coordinated."

The little Dukes nipped the
Point Part JV, 75-74, in their
season’s opener, but romped to
an easy 90-70 win over Youngs-
town.

"were improving as we go
along.“ remarked Bailey. We‘re
finally starting to play as a team.“

Bailey cites limited practice to-
gether as a major problem for the
Dukes. “Billingy usually prac-
tices with the varsity and we have
little time to put things together."

Starting at forward for the
Dukes will be 6-5 Pete Polites and
6-4 Dan Slater.

CUB’S TIM GRGURICH
Backcourt men are 6-3 Pat Kel-

Cubs. the Dukes have only a cou-

Grgurich anticipates a good ball
game. “They have a couple of real
line ball players." he said. “and

if we can pull ourselves together. '

it could be pretty close."

   UCLA Will Compete 

Steel Bowl Celebrates
20th Year In Style

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

, I This year the Steel Bowl Basket-

‘iba-ll Tournament celebrates its

20th birthday in style with three
big plusses that make number 20
one of the best ever.

To begin with, the date of the

 ‘ classic is different.

The Civic Arena two-day hoop
affair will be held Dec. 29-30,
making the Steel Bowl a true holi-

~ day festival after years of being
 an early—December of basketball

entertainment for Pittsburgh fans.
Being a real holiday tourney,

‘ L the Steel Bowk people (officially
_. ¥ known as the Dapper Dan Club)
‘ 1 have been able to lure the best
A basketball coach the college ranks

have seen in the last seven years.

""I‘.l_1at’sI right, John Wooden him-

se|f—the man called the “coach
of the decade”—-will bring his

 UCLA Bruins to Pittsburgh for
., . the Steel Bowl.

‘Under Wooden. UCLA basket-
ball teams have one six of the last

g _l: seven NCAA national champion-
‘  ships, and four of the Bruins‘ five
starters this year were regulars

’ on

 

last season’s championship
team. Three of those gentlemen

    

,,.~\  . , ‘" ‘~.. . ‘“"’}

 

have been a part of two of the
Bruin title teams already.

Turning to holiday time and
bringing in the top-rated basket-
ball team in the nation isn‘t
enough for the people who head
the Steel Bowl planning commit-
tee in the classics anniversary
year.

Wouldn’t it be something if a
fan could be assured that the two
Pittsburgh teams would play each
other and if one of them would
also be certain of playing UCLA?

It sure would . . . in fact it sure
will be. The Steel Bowl has broken
its tradition of Pitt and Duquense
vying against visiting clubs on
opening night to earn the right for ’
a championship and a city title
pairing, either in the winners’
game or the losers’ game on final
night. This year Pitt plays Du-
quense at 7 p.m. opening night
and UCLA plays the fourth team
invited this year. the William and
Mary Indians.

Yes. this 20th birthday celebra-
tion of the Steel Bowl tourney does
seem like a good way to have a
party. Pitt head basketball coach
Buzz Ridl agrees.

“I would think, so,” he says.

“The attraction-the way it’s set
—is ideal. People get to see P_itt
play Duquesnegand each has it
followers in the district. And
others, who are perhaps neutral,
get a chance to see UCLA.”

It would seem that everyone is
forgetting about the small col-
lege from Williamsburg, Va.. that
is sening William and . . . uh,
Mary to challenge for the Steel
Bowl title. The Virginia boys must
seem like outcasts, right?

“No,“ says Ridl. “You‘d have
to consider us an outcast if you
call them one. They’re at about
our strength. They beat us last
yearf'

Perhaps the Panthers, too, are
outcast when in the company of
UCLA and Duquesne, teams who
can both be nationally ranked this
season. Ridl admists that his
team isn't in the class of the
Dukes or the Bruins yet. “But
we’re still going to prepare to
give them a good game,” he says.

All of the teams are supposed

to have the potential for better

years than they had last season.
UCLA is much the team of last
year—plus experience. Duquesne
lost only Bill Zoph and Willie
Hines from last year, and ‘has
picked up valuable depth from a
fine 1969-70 freshman squad. Wil-
liam and Mary has added a junior
college transfer and a Florida
State transfer. ‘

Pitt? Experience and the new
sophs are also supposed to help
the Panthers this year.

So far, records are coinciding
with expectations. The four teams
have started with an over-all 7-2
mark. UCLA and Duquesne are
2-0, William and Mary is 2-1,
and the Panthers are 1-1.

But one more thing that might
interest a Pittsburgh who is con-
cerned about anniversaries.

Either Pitt or Duquesne will
host UCLA on the second night of
the Steel Bowl, Dec. 30. If it’s Du-
quesne, the meeting will come ex-
actly 15 years and two days after
the clubs’ last meeting. If it’s Pitt,
the game will be played exactly
20 years and two days after the
last Bruin-Panther hoop clash.

UCLA won both of those “lasts.”

  Post Season Games,-.-
Ferris Goes To One

With the football season over, the majority of the Panther gridders ,

will retire to a well-deserved rest, waiting out the winter months until

spring practice begins in April.

The two exceptions are Charlie Hall and Denny Ferris. Both have
been selected to play in post season all-star games and will be partici-
pating in these classics as late December and early January.

Hall, the three-year veteran defensivelback has the honor of being

named to two contests, the Blue-
Grey game and the Hula Bowl. He
will begin working out for the
Blue-Grey game on Dec. 20.
The game will be played Dec. 28
in Montgomery, Ala.

 

CHARLIE HALL

DENNY FERRIS

Although Hall is “looking for-
ward to both of them,” he com-
ments that he’s “never been to
Hawaii before.” The Hula Bowl,
as the name indicates is played in
Hawaii. The game is scheduled
for Jan. 9 in Honolulu and should
provide some interesting fringe
benefits for Mr. Hall. A

“I had known about the games
for a while," said Hall. “I was
told by Coach (Carl) DePasqua in
October, right before the West
Virginia game. They scouted, me
last year and in the fall and
spring. so it was before I got hurt.
I think they picked me even before
this season started.”

Denny Ferris, a fleet footed

tailback, will be traveling to Tam-
pa, Fla., for the Coaches All-
American game on Jan. 8. Ferris
is the seventh leading rusher in
Pitt history.

Three F rats.
In Playoffs

In three nights of solid volley-
ball action last Tuesday, Wednes-
day and Thursday, three fraterni-
ty teams emerged unbeaten to
qualify for the two championship
playoff games this week.

Pi Kappa Alpha, behind the
spiking of Don Eschenbaugh, de-
feated Delta Tau Delta in this big
division battle. Earlier, the Pikas
had rolled over Sigma Chi, Theta
Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Kappa Theta.

Wednesday evening’s competi-
tion saw Delta Sigma Chi earn a
berth in the playoffs by edging
Lambda Phi. The former, having
won its division football crown a
few weeks ago, hopes to all the
way in volleyball.

Already the IFC football
champs, Phi Gamma Delta won
all four of their games Thursday
with a couple cliffhangers going
their way. Zeta Beta Tau, Kappa
Sig, Triangle and Delta Sigma Phi
were victimized by the Fijis, the

1968 fraternity volleyball winners. ,

The finding of a lethal blood
vessel disease associated with the
use of “speed” «methadrinei has
been reported by a team of physi-
cians at the Los Angeles County'-
L'niversity of Southern California
Medical Center.

This is the first time doctors
have been able to detect a specific
disease associated with “speed"
which belongs to a group of drugs
known as amphetamines.

Called necrotizing angiitis, the
disease can casue a fatal block-
age of the arteries leading to vi-
tal organs. Dr. B. Philip Citron,
who headed the research team,
said methadrine causes an infla-
mation in the arteries. With heal-
ing, scarring results which blocks
the blood vesels. The organ most
severely affected by the disease
is generally the kidney, leading to
renal failure and death.

The report appeared in the No-
vember issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine. The original
study involved 14 patients strick-

en with the disease. four of whom
died. Dr. Citron estimated that
between ten and 20 per cent of
persons shooting speed may de-

velop the disease. He added that
there is no correlation between
how long one takes methadrine
and the degree of the disease.

Pitt students who are also grad-
uates of Northeast.

The Northeast alumnae con-
tended that the incidents shown
in the film had been taken out of
context. Yet they also said that
the film was “spontaneous." If
the film was “spontaneous" then
it showed what was really happen-
ing in the school. It it was truly
“spontaneous" then the film
showed the genuine feelings and

reactions of both the teachers and
students.

In essence. High School, expos-
es the numerous indignities and
frustrations as all faced in a nor-
mal high school day. We tend to
forget things like the inane gym
classes. having to have a pass in
the halls. and the general attitude
of students worthlessness foster-
ed in education. High Schoo"
strikes a responsive chord.

Anyone having any sugges-
tions or criticisms of the speak-
ers, activities, and concerts spon-
sored by the Student Union
Board may contact the Chair-
man of the SUB Social Com-
mittee in 508 SU or at 272 N.
Dithridge.
