  Despite Some Objection

A

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Ronald Ziegler, the White House .

press secretary under Richard
Nixon, and one of the only political
associates of the former president
not indicted in the Watergate
affair, has accepted an invitation to
speak at Pitt February 24.

The evening lecture scheduled for
David Lawrence Hall, entitled
“The Presidency and the Press,”
will be one of Ziegler’s first on a
tour which is to run sporadically
from mid-February into 1976.

Although the Student Govern-
ment (SG) Programming Com-
mittee sent Ziegler an offer two
weeks ago, the committee ofﬁcially
voted Wednesday night to sign an

"- agreement with the" former presi-

dential press aide.
The action came only two days

' after ‘a student government at

Boston University, after asking
Ziegler to speak, voted to withdraw
the invitation following protests by
the dean of the Public Communi-
cations School and several stu-
dents. They charged Ziegler

B’ should not be allowed to earn a

proﬁt from the Watergate affair.

Some Pitt students,_including SG
President-elect Larry Platt, voiced
objections yeterday to Zieg_ler’s
scheduled speech here, citing
many of the same reasons protest-
ors gave at Boston University.

“I object to paying him $2500 to
speak,” Platt said. “Ziegler’s only
appeal to the‘ students on this
campus is derived from his role in
the systematic lying operation
called Watergate. I would hope
that students who were outraged
over the actions of Nixon’s men in
the Watergate scandal would be
equally outraged over paying
someone who was involved to talk
about them.”

Wendy Traub, co-chairperson of
the Programming Committee, be-
lieved it was important _Ziegler
speak to Pitt students. “I feel that

A E RON ZIEGLER

BY BILL MOORE

Curtiss Porter has been ofﬁcially
appointed to the chairmanship of
the Black Studies Department end-
ing more than one year and a half
of heated controversy over the
department’s top position.

The Pitt News revealed the plan-
ned appointment last week, but no
official word came from the office
of Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome L. Rosenberg until
yesterday afternoon.

Porter yesterday indicated he was
pleased with the appointment but
said there was need for “another
meeting with the Dean (Rosenberg)
to clear up a few inconsistencies
concerning the appointment.’ ’

Along with Porter’s appointment

, came outlined changes concerning

tenuring of Black Studies faculty
and the creation of a study com-
mission to look into the future of
the department. _

Under the new procedure, deci-
sions on tenure would come from
an ad hoc committee rather than
the normal ‘procedure of taking
recommendations from already
tenured faculty in CAS depart-
ments since Black Studies pres-
ently has only one tenured faculty
member--Jack Daniel, a former
department chairman.

The study commission, made up
of people outside of the‘ Black
Studies department appointed by
Rosenberg and Provost Rhoten A.

050 Recommendation

52   Groups May Lose Status

BY PETE BUTCH

The Committee on Student Or-
ganizations (CS0), in a 6-1 vote last
night, recommended the Student
Government Board (SGB) withdraw
recognition from 32 Pitt sponsored
groups.

The recommendation will be on
the agenda of next week’s' SGB
meeting when the fate of the
groups will be ultimately decided.
The groups had failed to file proof
of membership by the deadline
date. ‘

Not affected by this ruling are the
Gay Students at Pitt (GSP), the
Young Socialists Alliance (YSA)
and the Third World Peoples
Coalition. These three ‘groups
received a requested extension to
February 11 so that an alternate
method of determining their legit-
imacy could be devised. It had
been reported in the January 29
Pitt News that these groups did not
wish to- supply any members’
names for proof of membership due
to fear of harassment.

The groups in danger of losing
recognition are: Alpha Epsilon
Delta, Alpha Pi Mu, Amateur
Radio Association, Angel Flight,

‘Army ROTC Cadet Brigade, Arnold

Air Society, Association of Under-
graduates in Education, Beta Beta

Beta, Christian Science Organiz_a- V

tion, Dwens, Delta Phi Alpha,
Intrafraternity Council-

'P_harmacy, Men’s Glee Club,

L’Arte e La Cultura, Omicron

‘ Sigma Rho, and Order of Omega. '

Also in danger are: Pantherettes,
Pershing Riﬂes, Pi Tau Sigma, Pitt
Bowling Club, Pitt Hosts, Pitt Judo
Club,-Pitt Sailing Club, Pitt Table
Tennis 'Club, Ranger Company,
Skyscraper Engineers, Society of
Automotive Engineers, Top Hat
Club, Undergraduate History
Forum, Veterans Association,
William Pitt Debate Union, and the
Young Americans for Freedom.

The CSO made the, recommen-
dations when the “groups did not
file proof of membership which
show the group to be an active
campus organization. The original

‘deadline was January 11, it was"

then extended to January 24.

'When no groups had responded by

last night’s meeting CSO voted to
recommend withdraw] of recogni-
tion. . ’

When the ﬁrst deadline was
passed CSO successfully contacted
the groups. Most contacts were
made in person and each group had
already received a letter explaining
the situation. The Pitt Road Racing
team had also failed to file proof of
membership but was given an
extention since they had made an

New ‘Dummy ’ File   Systeml

Aids I/ie wing of Records

BY BRIAN DUNN
Students wishing to see their
conﬁdential University ﬁles will be
aided by a new system being
prepared by the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs.

The system will be a “dummy”
collection of the different kinds of
records now open to students under
the Buckley Amendment, which
was recently amended by Con-
gress.

Co-ordinator of the Campus Judi-
cial System, Alden E. Bowen said
each department has been_ asked to
send blank copies of pertinent
records to Student Affairs. Any
student may go to the Student
Affairs office at 100 SU to see
which departments keep which
records. A

V servegto advance Black Studies as 
an academic discipline within‘ the  

University of Pittsburgh .’ ’

 

Porter, 35, is one of the founders.  

of the Black Studies department
and has served in various roles in

the department since its inception. ' 
Porter’s appointment provides the O A ‘

Black Studies department with its

ﬁrst permanent head since the ,
resignation of Daniel in the sum-.

mer of 1973. The position was

ﬁlled- by interim head Ann Jones,

until she resigned January 15. '

Roland Smith was appointedto
. head Black Studies in October but

resigned amidst heavy protest.

More than 100 black students and
faculty who supported Porter jam-
med the Chancellor’s office ‘Oct-

“Most departments have already
sent us the records and the dummy
ﬁle should be complete soon,”
Bowen said. “It will save students
the trouble of wandering all over
campus to find their ﬁles.”
Students may then go to indivi-

dual departments to see their_

personal records, Bowen said.

The new amendment, which was
signed by President Ford earlier
this month, clariﬁed several ambi-
guities in the Buckley Amendment.

Among the clariﬁcations were: V

(1) Only those recommendations
written since January 1, 1075, are
open to students.

(2) it is not necessary for _a
student contesting the accuracy of

ulating, and above all, well at-
tended by students.”

Traub did not believe Ziegler’s
lecture should be cancelled be-
cause of his unpopular association
with the Nixon administration.
“Many people have lectured here--
Robert Welch, president of the
John Birch Society, Bobby Seale,
Angela Davis--who stood for things
some students felt to be immoral or
unethical,” she said. “But it’s
good to get these varied viewpoints
out.”

Despite the objections of some
students, the contract with Zieg-
ler’s agent, the Leigh Bueau in
New York City, will be signed
Monday by Jack Brown,‘assistant
director of Student Activities.
Brown said the offer would stand
unless members of the Program-
ming Committee changed their
minds.

Legally, however, the Student
Government Board has voting
power to overrule the committee’s
request for the $2500 fee to pay
Ziegler, but there were no indica-
tions Iast night of an impending
action.

The SG Programming Committee
must Sign and return Ziegler’s
contract by February 6, or the
agreement is nullified. William
Leigh, owner of the Leigh Bureau,
said yesterday if a contract were
signed, it would be impossible for
one party to renege without suffer-
ing costs.

“We don’t like to go around
sueing people," Leigh said, “But I

can’t think of any reason why we_

wouldn’t insist on the money if a
university pulled out after signing a
contract.”

Leigh said he had not yet heard
from Boston University concerning
their interest in withdrawing Zieg-
ler’s invitation, but added the
school had a binding agreement
and could be forced to pay.

Ziegler’s schedule for his day at
Pitt is uncertain but Traub said he
would be available to talk with
some classes before his lecture at
8:30 pm.

As President Nixon’s press secre-
tary, Ziegler was confronted daily
be reporters at White House brief-
ings, and during the years of
Watergate, was repeatedly asked
to explain seeming discrepancies in

Ziegler-Appearance Scheduled

the actions of Nixon and members
of his administration. He some-
times angered the correspondents
when he described contradicting
statements as “inoperative.”
Ziegler continued until the end
with the former president, but was

never publicly charged with a '

crime, as many other Nixon assoc-
iates had been in the decline and
fall of his administration.

information in his file to still be in
attendance at the institution.

(3) Only the accuracy and appro-
priateness of material may be
questioned, and not the judgement
(grade).

(4) A record is defined as material
directly related to the student,
maintained by the school or one of
its agenst, and used for making
decisions about the student or for
transmitting to others outside of
the -institution.

“Every student, especially during
the winter term of his senior year,
should take a look at his record,”
Bowen said. “Before he leaves the
University, he should see that there
is nothing misleading that may be
coming out of here for the next 20

years.”

College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Associate Dean Tobias Dun-
kelberger downplayed the signiﬁ-
cance of the amendment, saying
CAS has had an open-ﬁles polilcy
for several years.

“People imagined much about

"this amendment, but in fact practi-

cally nobody has come up here to
see his ﬁle,” Dunkelberger said.

“Only one student has complained
about something, and we struck it
out immediately.”

A secretary at the CAS office said
less than five students have asked
to see their files since Jan. 1.

CAS students with ID cards may
see their files in 917 CL between
8:30 and 9:30 am on weekdays
except Wednesday.

SGB Staff: line Possibility

BY TOM SMITH

Nearly a year ago, then outgoing
Student Government (SG) Presi-
dent Rege Kaufman proposed the
establishment of an executive
branch of government to mirror the
bureaucracy of SG and the
University.

The proposal was also intended to
keep Student Government opera-
tions functioning despite an in-
efficient or disinterested Board.

The newly elected Furick board
rejected that notion, and quite
correctly so, on the basis that
Student Government was only
creating another set of bureaucratic
channels to mirror its own
bureaucracy. It was also thought,
then, that the authority of each
individual Board member might
erode.

Now after one year. it is evident
that the Student Government
Board needs expanded in some way
so as to prevent absent and
uncaring Board members from
jeopardizing the total SG operation.

But also, it is still clear the
Kaufman proposal was inadequate.

It should never be forgotten that
each and "every SGB member was
electedto represent Pitt students,
and, therefore, is solely respon-
sible for the decisions which must
be made by elected representatives
over the course of the year. Any
system which seeks to replace
elected representatives with ap-

Letter to the Editor

Getting ROTG Facts Straight

Dear Editor,

This letter is in answer to Mr.
0’Brien’s erroneous letter of Nov.
20. Mr. O’Brien claims that
hundreds of universities don’t even
allow ROTC on campus, I truly
question his source of information.
According to official government
reports more than 200 colleges and
universities across the country are
presently on a waiting list for
ROTC to come to their campus,
including some of the schools that
led the ﬁght to remove ROTC
during the 1960’s. This compares
to the only 1 or 2 dozen schools that
don’t allow ROTC on campus.

Mr. O’Brien goes on to tell us that
in 1969 at Indiana University he
was forced to take two semesters .of
ROTC. I would like to remind Mr.
O’Brien that we are now in ‘I974 at
the University of Pittsburgh, and
that the two are in no stretch of the
imagination related. Today there
isn't one mandatory ROTC course
on any civilian campus.

This is also the first time in two
years that credit reinstatement has
been brought up but Mr. O’Brien
claims that just last year it was
denied for a multitude of reasons.
What were these multitudes of
reasons? Well the truth is that
since credit was removed 6 years
ago many changes have come
about in the program such as better
qualified instructors, new texts,
(which was originally edited by
Wesley Posvar) and new teaching
methods, all of which we feel merit
credit reinstatement.

Mr. O’Brien states that ROTC
cadets receive $100 a month which
is exactly what the military has
been saying. The thing is, that he
fails to mention that it is based on
academic achievements in high
school and college, and is a very
difficult scholarship to receive. He
is also very "uninformed about the
facts of this issue regarding
credits. We don’t ask for credits
for extracurricular work, as he

pointed bureaucrats is counter to
the democratic concept of an
elected Student Government.

It is also clear by now that the
operations of the Student Govern-
ment Board needs to be re-
organized, and perhaps one of the
first steps to revitalize Student
Government would be the appoint-
ment of a staff for each individual
Board member.

It would be a staff member’s
responsibility to organize the
activities of an individual Board
member.

A staff could be responsible for
suggesting areas of interest or
identify student problems for each
Board member, and help devise
solutions to those problems. It

.' would be the staff member’s

responsibility to schedule the
meetings necessary for the resolu-
tion of the problem.

For example, if a Board member
was studying the possibility of
reduced bus fares for Pitt students,
he could be assisted by his staff to
devise some means of attacking
this issue. The staff member
acting as a secretary could arrange
the necessary meetings with other
interested students and PAT
officials.

In‘ this way the Board member
would not be dependent solely on
his own ability or that of his fellow
Board members, who would have
their own special projects, to
resolve the problem. And there

states we are, but merely for credit
for the three hours of class which is
open to all students. If Mr.
O’Brien is really interested in facts
he would have looked in on a few of
the courses which are offered.

The statement that ROTC is a
death institution and presenting
the case of Lt. Calley is an atrocious
argument. The question wasasked
“Are the rights of the ROTC cadet
being denied?” The answer is "
obviously yes if this is truly a
liberal university that promotes the
students to look at an issue from
different points of view. The point
was also brought up about Lt.
Calley denying the rights of Viet-
namese citizens. If Mr. O’Brien
is interested in facts he may want
to know thatALt. Calley was not a
product of ROTC, but was a junior
college dropout who became com-
missioned through an Army Officer
Candidate School. Lt. Calley is the
very thing ROTC works to avoid, in
fact it was a ROTC graduate who
reported Lt. Calley.
and many more are available to
anyone interested enough to ask
any ROTC officer or the staff on the
fourth floor CL. I personally invite

These facts .

would be no excuse for the elected
representative to be unprepared to
adequately represent the interests
of Pitt students.

But, the staff could also perform

another function by serving as a '

watchdog over the elected repres-
entative. The staff would be in a
position to know firsthand the
extend of the Board member’s
work, or lack of work, and could
report it to the SG President for
some action.

Overall, the Board would be
better able to concentrate its efforts
in many areas in excess of an
annual seven point priority list (one
for each Board member). This
would also involve more people in
the Student Government pro-
cesses-positions which have the
potential of being more exciting
and vital than any of the seats on

SG committees. .

The plan would also help
streamline and structure the SGB’s
operations, which at the present

time are the most chaotic and C

ineffective in all of Student

Government.

But, more than anything it would
provide a mechanism for making
the SG Board more than a one
meeting a week operation. And

_ who knows, it might even lead to a

Student Government which is
active in solving the many
problems, facing the Pitt campus
today.

Mr. O’Brien to speak to me and
maybe we can clear up a few
misconceptions about the program.

As to Mr. O’biien's plea for life,

anti-militarism, and peace I feel’ the --

words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur
from a speech at West Point, May
1962, are very appropriate.

This does not mean you are war
mongers on the contrary the soldier
above all other people prays for
peace for he must suffer and bear
the deepest wounds and scars of
war but always in ourears ring the
ominous words of Plato that wisest
of all philosophers, “Only the dead
have seen the end of war.”

New Board of Trustees member Sheila Rathke plans t bring togeth

81'

Pitt government heads to keep her informed of student needs.

BY RITA VITOL0

2"-t.g_ Sheila Rathke is a young, polite,

xé

and determined woman. And a
wife, mother and student in the
School of General Studies.

She is also the new student
trustee on Pitt’s Board of Trustees
--your trustee.

Rathke’s appointment,
came as a big surprise,
announced January 3, just two
weeks before the Board’s first
meeting of 1975. She is still pretty
much in the learning process as a
trustee.

The student trustee _represents a
group--Pitt’s 30,000 students--and
that makes her position a little
different from that of the other 35
“members of the Board, which is
ultimately responsible for the
policy and decision-making actions
of the University. The Chancellor
and his administrators are dele-
gates of the Board’s responsibility.

and it

was .

She is only the second student to
serve on the Board in the
Shapp-created position, replacing
Sharon Novak, who served three
years before her term expired last

. November 17.

But the student trustee is a
full-fledged, voting member of the
Board, with all that that entails.
Her first meeting was January 14,
where Rathke decided to listen and
feel out her new job..

“The meetings are very formal--
discussions go on in committees
before the meeting,” said Rathke,
who attended a session of the
Academic Affairs Committee Jan-
uary 14. “The trustees are very

concerned about what’s going ‘on,

and they are very, very thorough.”

Before Rathke can reach her goal,
however, of “a well-informed
trustee who keeps in touch with
students,” and put some of the
plans in her head into action, she
needs more time, and more input
from Pitt’s students.

“Before I ﬁgure out exactly what
I’m going to do,” Rathke said, “I
have to ﬁgure out how.”

' Already Rathke has “the germ of

an idea” to bring together all the
heads of Pitt’s various student
governments--Nick Exton of the
Graduate and Professional Student
Association, Carol Cushman of the
General Studies Student Cabinet,
and the out-going Mike Furick, as
well as the new SG President Larry
Platt, of the Student Government
Board--in a free-form_ committee to
talkover problems and keepher
informed of the students’ interests.

From Exton she has heard
complaints of the lack of housing
for graduate students, and the
quality of the "existing graduate
housing. For General Studies
students she is concerned with the
lack of services and student aid for
part-timers, and likewise for the

-quality of life on campus for day

students.
Rathke’s term as a trustee will last

for -years, although she expects to

graduate--and hopefully, then at-
tend graduate school--by 1976. She
is an English and speech major in
the School of General Studies.
Whether she will continue as a

trustee after graduation is still
open to question, Rathke said, after
she clears the details of the length
of her term with Governor Shapp.
Rathke sees her primary respon-
silsiility is to the students--to the
quality of their education and the
quality of their life at Pitt.
Rathke was selected as the
nominee from SGS from the
semi-final field of three students,
each nominated by their respective
student governments. The other

nominees were Lynn George.

Kessel of the Graduate and
Professional Student Association
and Haig Sakoian of the under-
graduate Student Government.
The nominations were submitted
to Secretary of Education John
Pittenger who conducted personal
interviews with the three, and then
passed onto the Governor’s office
where the appointment was made.
The appointment of another
student trustee‘ is seen as a
continuation of Shapp’s 1971
decision that “young people will
provide the Board of Trustees with
input and viewpoints which are

- often ignored or overlooked.”

Barthelme in review

BY HARRIS LEVY

GUILTY PLEASURES by Donald
Barthelme, 165 pages Farrar,
— Straus and Giroux $7.95

_ SADNESS by Donald Barthelme
181 pages Bantam Books $1.65

Q: Is Nothing sacred?

A: Not for Donald Barthelme. In
Guilty Pleasures, his ﬁrst collection
of parodies and satires, Barthelme
even includes a story, “Nothing: A
Preliminary Account,” which tries
' to deﬁne what nothing isn’t. ‘‘It’s
not the yellow curtains. Nor curtain
rings. Nor is it bran in a bucket, nor
bran, nor is it the large reddish
farm animal eating the bran from
? the bucket, the man who placed the
bran in the bucket, his wife, or the
raisin-faced banker who’s about to
‘foreclose on the farm.”

The futility of questions like
“What is reality?” is mocked with
wit and accuracy in “Nothing.”
Q:' Deﬁning what nothing is not is
deﬁnitely not nothing. But what
else does Barthelme write about?
A: In Sadness, which was just

V issued in paperback, and in his
other collections of stories, Bar-
thelme has always been concerned

“ " with the relationship between style

andsubject. The medium is, the
message for Barthelme and he
 shows as much concern for

 A,’ technique as for content. Sadness
I combines Barthelme’s
understanding of the mundane as
well as the extraordinary with
stylistic versatility that encom-
-‘passes picture collages, letters,
dialogues and lists.

Guilty Pleasures satirizes con-
temporary culture through its

'magazines and literary fads.
Typical is a parody of Cosmopolitan
complete with emphasis and
exclamation points. .
Q: That sounds fantastic!

A: Barthelme’s skill at manipulat-
ing words has enabled him to
piercerthe stylistic veils of others.
Healthy skepticism for current
trends ﬁlls “The Teachings of Don
B.: A Yankee Way of Knowledge”
a clever satire of Carlos Castena-_
da’s Don Juan books. Characteris-
tics of the Consumer Bulletin
Annual, Antonioni ﬁlms, highbrow
art journals and Britain’s aging
Angry Young Men are exaggerated
"with insight. ‘
Q: Does Barthelme write, about
other aspects of contemporary life?

» A:. Yes. While the writing parodies
parallel his short story techniques,
Guilty Pleasures shows the author

. branching out in new directions. As
he writes, “A number of the pieces
are political satire directed against
a particular Administration.” A-
musing as these pieces are, as their
subject matter fades from memory,

  

 

  
 

The Ivy School of Professional Art

they may become dated, or should I
say, “inoperative.”

Q: Are there any stories with
pictures like those in Barthelme’s
story collections?

A: Guilty Pleasures’ includes two
ﬁne stories with illustrations. “A
Nation of Wheels” may be his
ﬁnest illustrated story. Wheels
take over the country in a piece
distinguished by the author's usual
deadpan understatement and se-
lection of old etchings and prints.
Who else could imagine a “Venus
of Akron”?

Q: All in all, how does Guilty
Pleasures compare to Barthelme’s
other books?

A: Guilty Pleasures has the same
unique imagination that made story
collections like City Life and
Sadness. outstanding. Barthelme’s
new book is consistently funny and
very few of the 27 stories fail to be
amusing as they expose the foibles
and gullibility of writers, politicians
and just plain folks.

“Dracula”:
Bromo, Nausea

BY M.C. PILECKI

When the marquee for/" Andy
Warhol’s Dracula ﬁrst went up, the
initial question was: could this flick
possibly be any worse that Andy
Warhol’s Frankenstein?

Well, Frankenstein is still number
one on the raunch list, but Blood
for Dracula (the “réal”.title for this
latest Paul Morrisey epic) could run
at least a close second. ‘As all of the
latest “Andy Warhol” movies, this
one has nothing to do with the
controversial pioneer of pop art,
and has as much of his artistic
touch as the original Campbell's
soup can. He just puts his name on
it like a kindly old soul would a
bastard child and supposedly puts
up‘ the money for the whole mess.

Dracula has pretty much the same
sick crew as Frankenstein, but this
time around it’s not in wobbly 3-D
so you might survive the movie
without suffering severe eye strain.

But not the nausea. Nope, it’s
another two-Bromo ﬂick, and take
your own paper bag.

Sex and violence strike again, but
you never thought it could be so
dull. After you’ve seen one
vampire vomit blood, you’ve seen
‘em all.

The “plot" concerns the plight of
poor Count Cracula, who needs
virgins’ blood for sustenance.
Since all the virgins in Rumania
have long caught on to the Dracula
family, he has to split to Italy in
search of a virgin. It’s a long trip.
He ﬁnally meets up with a land-
poor family of noble title, and
proposes a marriage to one of the
four daughters.

Naturally, he’s not really thinking
of marriage, but more of a one-

night quickie—through the jugular‘

vein. He works his way through
the first two daughters, who turn
out to be non-virgins and therefore
not healthy for him. And just
before he gets to the youngest
daughter—-a‘ definite virgin—hero
and resident stud Joe Dalessandro

takes her out of harm’s way by
making. sure she’s unsuitable for
the vampire. He then proceeds to
hack apart Count Dracula in the
goriest manner possible, making
the ﬁnal wooden stake through the
heart rather ridiculously unneces-
sary.

The ﬁlm has one or two moments
of camp humor, especially when
Dalessandro tries to look sexy, but
you haveto be much more atentive
than the movie is really worth. The
photography is less garish than
Frankenstein, and the “actors”
phony Italian accents don’t slip
nearly as badly as their Bulgarian
ones did before. But the whole

production would still fail on a UHF
TV commercial.

Vocalist Damita Jo,’ whose re-
cordings of “Save the Last Dance
for Me” and “If You Go Away”
were million-sellers, will make her
first appearance at Walt Harper’s
Attic for five days beginning Feb-
ruary 4 and running through Feb-
ruary 8.

Sharing the bill with Damita Jo
will be Walt Harper and All That
Jazz, who will play between the
various shows. Damita Jo will do
two shows on Tuesay, Wednesday
and Thursday, and three shows on
Friday and Saturday.

  Thoughts V 
at Small

BY JESS M. BRALLIER

 

Arts Editor

Until this past weekend, I believed that mankind would never discover
the proper and moral means where by artistic egotists might be
eliminated. But today, I am happy to announce that a truly remarkable
gentleman by the name of Clyde Arthur Frye has succeeded in
developing such a solution. Needless to say, I am pleased.

But before continuing with Mr. Frye a few points need to be made.
First, one must recognize that your everyday egotist can be classiﬁed
into several categories, the most bothersome of which is the artistic
egotist.

‘The main problem with one’s basic artistic egotist is that they have
nothing of value to offer, whether it’s honesty or art. At least a
drunken loud-mouthed-bar-sitting egotist is honestly admitting, if just
not by his mere‘ presence, that he’s basically a mess. And. the
joke-telling egotist isn’t all so bad for either he’s actually funny or in
possession of a classic and amusing comeback once you’ve told him or
her to get lost. ‘

But an artistic egotist is nothing but a nauseating pain in the ear
channel. The most fully developed egotist is one who ﬁrst corners you

with a poem, then jumps to a guitar, then back to the corner with a

short story, then into a once intellectual conversation, ﬁlling it with
non-relevant and usually non-factual information and who ﬁnallytops
off the tragic scene with a little one-step dance exhibition...bothersome
rats, all of them.

Now these rattish types are difficult to rid yourself of, and although
I’ve been working on a solution since freshman year I’ve yet to come up
with one. Or that is, until I met Mr. Frye. -

Basically, what Frye has done over the past 20 years is conditioned his ,.

stomach to puke on command. Yeah, really...let me explain.

__On meeting an artistic egotist, Frye_simply n_1utters “James J_oyce”
(the command) and in a matter of a few seconds, gasps and sputters,
he pukes all over the artistic egotist, It’s fantastic.‘

For example, on Friday evening, this blue jeaned, frizzy haired girl
started reading a poem of sorts to Frye, never giving him the chance to
politely refuse her reading. So Frye just moved up real close to her,
muttered “James Joyce” and threw up a remarkable quart full or so of I
thick yellow ﬂuid all over her face and most importantly all over this
silly poem of hers. . .

Sadly, the scene so moved and inspired a ﬂoating guitarist that he‘
bluntly called attention to himself and began to pluck. Again, Frye
calmly'approached' the guitarist and muttered “James Joyce” where
upon he threw up on the guitarist...beautiful. ‘ '

Amazed by the whole thing, and of course being careful not to offend '

him, I approached Frye. Soon we found ourselves quite compatible
and talked for several hours. Before leaving, I asked what further
work, if any, remained to be done on his puke technique. , “Not much,”
he replied, “except developing the ability .to consciously choose the
texture, odor and color of my commentary.” Anxious to learn
everything about the technique Icould since I’ll be at Pitt a bit longer, I
asked him how much longer it would take to work it all out. ” ‘ ‘About a
year,” he said, as he politely tipped his derby and left the bar.
Tomorrow I begin practicing and conditioning...I can hardly wait.

The time has come today.

All the practice has ended and the
little meets are out of the way. The
real competition begins this week-

_ ‘_;\end as the Pitt Tracksters host the

Eﬁnual Pitt Invitational.

Begun six years ago with only
seven teams, the Invite has grown
and improved until last year 26
teams were entered.

‘_‘Last year we invited too many
teams,” said a soft-spoken Jim
Banner. “There were so many
runners we had to let them use the
track constantly which caused great
confusion.”

Looking ahead to this year,
Banner allowed only 18 teams to
register. 7 7

“The purpose of last week’s ﬁv
team meet was to take some of the
congestion from this week’s meet

2’, *.,\without slighting the contestants.”

\Of the 18 teams scheduled to
bring all or part of their squads, it
comes down to four big guns:

Maryland, Cleveland State, East

_, Tennessee State, and Pitt.

“With track teams on such tight
budgets a lot of teams are only
bringing their best people,”
explained Banner. “They just
can’t afford to bring all of their
athletes.”

For the ﬁrst time this season
women will be ‘entered in six
differnt events. The girls will
represent Pitt, Slippery Rock,
Fairmont State, and ACC.

“We’ve been working with the
“girl’s track ‘coach here,” said
Banner, “and things have been
working out very well. Last week

There will be some very tense
moments for Pitt’s gymnastics
team this weekend.

Against the University of Massa-
chusetts, a team whom the
Panthers face tonight at 7:30, Rob
Pasterick, one of Pitt’s all-around
men and team captain, will attempt

 ‘/,.=‘i‘\'a1‘;louble back sommersault. Head

coach lg Perez has called the
double back “one of the most
hazardous moves in gymnastics,”
and indeed it is. ~
Pasterick has been doing the
double back in practice this week,
and says that it- will be “a hit or
miss trick.” “The only danger I’ll
have,” Pasterick explains, “is
overspinning it.” He is the first
man in Pitt’s history to do the
double back. and only ﬁve men in

our girls placed second in the
Allegheny Mountain Invitational so
they are a good team.”

“Surprisingly,” Banner contin-
ued,” we have had a very large
number of contestants for the girl’s
events. In the 440 yard dash for
example, there are about 18
contestants.”

The Pitt Tracksters so far this
season have been wiping the ﬂoor
with their opponents and with-
everyone in good physical shape a
repeat of last year’s excellent
showing could happen again.

But don’t write off everyone.

The 440 is shaping up as one of
the best events of the Invitational
with Karl Farmer of Pitt (who has-
already qualified for the NCAA
Championships later this year)
meeting stiff competition from
Doran Marcus of East Tennessee
State, and George Proctor and
Gerald Johnson from Maryland.

Chuck Mozingo in the 660 is
facing tough competition from the
Maryland squad and the men from
Tennessee. '7

the whole Eastern United States do
the trick.

Massachusetts: scores about 200
points as a team, and it is
imperative that the Panthers hit on
all their tricks, since Pitt has been
scoring 164 points most of the year.

Gus Papantonio, the second of
Pitt’s all-around men, will do a
doublt back on the parallel bars, a
move which only three ,men in the

. Eastern states can perform.

Rounding out the trio of all-

around men for the Panthers is Don S

Stevenson, who plans to do a full
twisting back layout off of the

‘parallel bars. It is a unique move,

because nobody in the East has
added it to their routine.

The tension does not vanish with
Pitt’s all-around men.

and George Jupin are expected to
improve on their leaps in last weeks
mini-meet and perhaps top Riley’s
record of 7’ recorded last year at
the Invitational.

Keith Taylor, one of many
hustling freshman will be trying to
double in both the triple and long
jumps as he did last week. With
the improved competition Taylor’s
predication of 50 or more feet in the
triple could become reality.

Rich Markley, the “sparkle” of
the Pitt team and last year's
MVP will run up

young season when he ‘meets Bill
Ohlmacher of Maryland who has
run seven tenths of a second faster
than Markley thus far.

Maryland again is the big gun in
the mile relay, an event which Pitt
has won every time out this season.
The Terrapins have run a 3:20.8 to
the Panther’s 3122.1 so anything

. could happen. .

“The way things stand we are
looking for an outstanding meet,”
said Banner. “With the amount of
small colleges coming, bringing
their best there is a good chance of
some bigesurprises.”

“All in all,” Banner continued,
“this is our most difﬁcult meet so
far.” With the performances Pitt
has displayed as of now, the track
fan can-expect a good showing from
the Tracksters tonight.

The meet will ofﬁcially get
underway this afternoon with the
pole vault at 3:30 followed by the
triple jump at 4:00 and the running
trials at 6:00. Beginning at 1:00
Saturday the finals will be held in
all remaining events.

layout to his routine. The .trick,i_s of
superior difﬁculty, and with its
addition Boyette will
improve on his best score for ‘the
year.

“We’1l be gunning for 167 points
this weekend,” Perez noted. The
Panthers will need all they can
muster against the minutemen if
they are to build some conﬁdence
to carry them into the rest of the
season. _

Due to some faulty scheduling by
the athletic department, the
Cornell team will come vaulting
into Trees gym for a match on
Saturday afternoon against the
Panther gymnasts, just a few hours
after the Massachusetts team has
left.

“I’m -very upset with the
scheduling,” Perez fumed. “No
consideration for the athletes was
taken into account.”

Back-to-back gymnastics meets is
a lot like having your mother-in-law
over for Saturday dinner and your
most hated acquaintence drop by
for Sunday brunch. The Cornell
squad has been scoring about 185
points per meet, and ~ their
strengths are in the vaulting, ﬂoor
exercise, and parallel bar events.

An interesting part of the Cornell
meet will be the contest among the
Panthers’ all-around men and the
all-around men from Cornell. Both
Brian Dawson and Pete Fay have
the capability of scoring over 47
points in the all-around for Cornell,
and this in itself should be enough
of a challenge for the Panthers.

Smash Team Records A

_Walker, Lopez, Reisdorf and Sue»

After breaking every team record
in their ﬁrst meet of the season last
November, how could the Panther-
ette swimmers’ progress any other
way except with great strides?
Well, _that’s exactly how it is going
for ﬁrst year coach Kate Mathi-
son’s swimmin’ women. And after
defeating Penn State (third in the
East) last December, where could
Pitt go from there?

Pitt swam Ohio State and Clarion
over the weekend and lost to both
teams but the answer is not that
simple.
tough enough, but when the com-
petition happens to be Clarion
(second in the East in women’s
swimming) and Ohio State (a more
competitive team than Clarion)-
well, that provides for a demanding
schedule, to say the least.

The Pantherettes swimmers put in
ﬁne performances that broke ten
team records and set two Clarion
pool records only to lose both meets
in the ﬁnal relays. This was the
ﬁrst time that Pitt swam Ohio
State, who won by the score of
68-63. Clarion, an old-time rival,
Last
season Clarion beat Pitt soundly,
76-37.

Notable performances were stag-
ed by Angie Lopez, Pitt’s only
female all-American, in the 50 and
100 yard/' breastroke events (she
now holds pool records at Clarion in
these events) and the 100 yard
individual medley. Team captain
Mamie- Heretick also set team
marks in the 100, 200 and 400 yard
freestyle events, qualifying her for
the National Championships in the
200 yard event.

Other team records were’ set by
freshmen Sharion Reisdorf (100

(yard butterﬂy), Connie Walker (100

yard backstroke) and Lois Gould
(50 yard backstroke). Pitt’s 200
yard_medley and freestyle relays

also set team marks with times of

1:58.45 and 1:46.84, respectively.

Coach Mathison was pleased with -

her swimmers’ performances over
the weekend, although she believes
Pitt could have made a better
showing at Ohio State.
Clarion however, Mattison‘ says,

‘‘I couldn’t ask for anything more
from the swimmers or divers.

What can I say about a meet like‘
that? We’re certainly looking

forward to seeing both teams in" '
