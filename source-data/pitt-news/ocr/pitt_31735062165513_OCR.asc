‘Silent Spring’ at Book Center

By SUSANNE ECKMAN

The Fine Books Room of the
University Book C enter was
crowded_ last Wednesday as Dr.
Peter Gray, head of the biology.
department, evaluated Rachael
Carson’s Silent Spring. ‘

The recently-published,“ book,
according to Dr. Gray, has stirred
sole much [controversy that. it
“makes calm dicussion difficult.”
Nevertheless, he tried a “schola‘r-
lye approach” to the _topic, divid-
ing it into three categories: what
facts the book gives, whether the
author "is qualiﬁed to make state-
ments, and what she uses to back
 the book, ' i

The themefof the‘ book is that
men are doing more harm than
good with the‘ use of modern "pest
controls.‘ This can be seen easily

HIGH TEST, LOW TEST, NOTEST

Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, “Doyou
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being
overemphasized?” (The little woman, incidentally, is not, as

you might think, my wife. My Wife is far from 9. little woman-

She is, in fact, almost seven feet high and heavily muscled.
She is a full-blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world’s
hammer-throw record. The little woman I referred to is some-

one we found crouching under the sofa when we moved into 7
, our apartment several years ago, and there she has remained

ever since. She never speaks, except to make a. kind of guttural
clicking sound when she is hungry. Actually, she is not too
much fun to have around, but with ‘my wife away at track meets
most of the time, at least it gives me somebody to talk to.)

' But I digress. “Do you think the importance of tests in
American colleges is being»overemphasized?” _I said the other
night to the little woman, andthen I said, “Yes, Max, I‘do
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being
overemphasized.” (As I have explained, the little woman does
notspeak, so when We have conversations, I am forced to do

both parts.)

Zéc rac/nit/z/2

To get back to tests—sure, they’re important, but let’s not
allow them to get too important. There are, after all, many

- qualities and talents that simply can’ t be measured by quizzes. ..

Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose gifts don’t happen

to be of the academic -variety? Like, for instance, Gregor ,
. Sigafoos? . S

Gregor, a freshman at the New Hampshire College of Tanning
and Belles Lettres, has never passed a single test; yet all who
know him agree that he is studded with talent like a ham with

cloves. He can, for example, sleep standing up. He can do a"

perfect imitation of a scarlet tanager. (I don’t mean just do

the bird calls; I mean he can ﬂy South in the winter.) He can

pick up B-B’ s with his toes. He can say “Toy boat” three times

fast. He can build a rude telephone out of two empty Marlboro ‘

packsend 100 yards of butcher’s twine. (Of all his impressive
accomplishments, this last is the one Gregor likes to do best
—-not building the telephone, but emptying the Marlboro
packs. Gregor doesn’t just dump the Marlboros out of the
pack. He smokes them one at a time——settling back, getting
comfortable, savoring each tasty puff. As Gregor often says
with 9. Winsome smile, “By George, the makers of Marlboro
took their time "ﬁnding this ﬁne ﬂavor, this great ﬁlter, and by

V George, I’m going to take my time enjoying ’em l”)

_ Well, sir, there you have Gregor Sigafoos—-artist, humanist,
philosopher, Marlboro smoker, and freshman since 1939. Will
the world—so desperately in need of talent—ever beneﬁt from
Gregor’s great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college to stay.

But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Anna Livia
Plurabelle. Anna Livia, a classmate of Gregor’s, had no talent,
no gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was 9) knack for
taking tests. She would cram like crazy before a test, always
gets. perfect score, and then promptly forget everything she had
learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest honors and
degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that she left college
no more educated, no more prepared to cope with the world,
than when she entered. Today, a. broken woman, she croucheu
under my sofa. ' e mm Max shuhn...

And speaking of tests, we makers of .Marlboro put our.
cigarette through an impressive number before] we send

ﬂitgtojthe market. gB_ut ultimately, there isonly one test. ‘A

 ‘The Duke’ Apologizes
~F"or,Satirica| Article

Editor, The Pitt News

Re: ‘Duke’ Blasts University,
October 3rd issue of The Pitt
News. '

.I would like to extend the
apologies of the entire Duke
staff for any embarrassment
.which the Duke article caused
to Pitt University or its admin-
istration. The article was meant
--as a satire,‘ with no malicious
intent. It is neither our policy
not our practice to use our pub-
lication to cause ill-feelings or
anger on our own campus, or on
smother campus. '

Slavic Lecturer Calls
Editorial Absurd A

,Editor, The Pitt News
7‘ The editorial in the October
10 issue of The Pitt News cited
an incident of discrimination by
an instructor of the Slavic De-
partment. Since the reference is
so speciﬁc, I_ feel it is my duty
A to state the facts of the inci-
dent in question.
A trip to California and back
was contemplated by two ma-
ture women and myself; another
male driver wasneeded. In re-
sponse to an ad in The Pitt
News, Mr. Matt Nesvisky met
me and offered his services. But
to the second meeting he
brought a friend who also want-
ed to make the trip.

been too many for so long a trip,
I hesitated. Later, in a tele-
. phone conversation, I told Mr.

A‘ Nesvisky an additional reason
which, however, had absolutely
nothing to do with this second
person's race or nationality. I
,. ‘insist that I did not make the

remark attributed to me by the
editor, Mr. Nesvisky.

As I was not acting in any
capacity as a representative of
the University, neither did I
operate a public transportation
conveyance, I believe it was my
perfect right to choose my
travelling companions for a trip
in my ,own car.

The -same editorial ‘had~a quo-
tation which is very much to the
point in my case: “I feel that
I have been denied a basic hu-
man right —- that of choosing
my companions.” ‘

I- would like to state my back-

"ground so thatthose who read
this slanderous statement in the.

October 10 editorial would be
able to see the unfairness of this
allegation. A ~
First of all I am a naturalized
foreigner; one of the women,
the mother of one of our. grad-
uate teaching fellows, is also a
foreigner. In 1922 I 'was in
charge of the athletic program
in a camp for 1000 Armenian
refugee children in Constantin-
ople. I also taught in the capital
of- Turkey in Robert College,

,whcre students came from all

parts of the Near East.

After having come to the
United States, I was graduated
from the Springﬁeld YMCA Col-
lege, Mass., where students from
all parts of the world not only
study, but live and pray togeth-
er. For over 30 years I taught
and coached in the Westing-
house High School in Pittsburgh;
I made many hundreds of
friends in -that school where
Negroes comprised 85 percent of
the student body. Some of my
closest friends are from the
minority groups.

This is my record. I voice my
strong protest against the ac-
cusation which is ‘absurd, un-
true, unfounded and published
in bad taste in the university
student paper.

 Unimpressive-— Proposal . . .

The Student Government’s
proposal for the foreignstudents

The committee was set up as a
result of an article I wrote for
The Pitt News supplement (Sept.
17 issue), and I was supposed to
be one of the persons on the

'committee. Nancy Roland (and

others I did ‘not meet) advised in
setting up the program. So I
should have nothing but praise
for the program, such is, how-
ever, not the case.

After another article had ap-
peared in The Pitt News and'I
approached the “committee”
through The Pitt News reporter,

Nancy Roland did come and talk ‘

to me; however, she informed me
that she will return after she
talks to M‘iss“‘Renee_ Lichenstein,
foreign student advisor, and
show me the program she out-
lined for. S Gto peruse, «which
she did. My participation in the
formulation of the proposals

Lofty Ideals

The proposals themselves are
lofty in their ideals, buthard to
execute under the desired atm6s-
phere. It has been amply shown
by thefreshmen bigbrother pro-
gra_m that the upperclassmen

program is just a re-hash of an
old unsuccessful program,» and
can not hope to accomplish muc_h

_ Student Organizations

Given Yearly Budgets
‘ By BARRY GROSS

Most students organizations have been given their bud-
gets for this year, according to Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice
chancellor for student and general affairs. The organizations’
budgets are part of his department’s budget,

One third of the budget goes to the University libraries.

Budgets for students publications remained the same.

Those are The Pitt News, Owl;

Cap-su l e, Skyscraper Engineer,
and Ideas and Figures. The Foto
Club’s budget also remained the
same.
. SG Reduced

Campus radio station WPGH
hasn’t received its budget yet. Dr.
Rankin said its requests were
still being studied. The budget for
Student Government has been re-
duced, while that of the band has
been increased, Dr. Rankin said.

‘Pitt Players, Cheerleaders,

Ham Radio Club, and Men’s
Council, received the same

money this year as-last.

“Modest increases went to the
William Pitt, Debating Union, the
Glee Club, the Law School, and
the Graduate Student Organiza-
tion,” Dr. Rankin said.

Budget Doubled

Freshman Orientation’s budget
has been doubled, to acount for
the increased cost of the new sys-

tem whereby freshmen‘ visit the

University in several groups,
rather than all at once, for orien-
tation. —
Midday Series rated a ten’
percent increase in order to pay
for performers for programs"
during the third trimester.
Student. Union. programs will
also have more money. “We now
have more students, and they use
the Student Union," Dr. Rankin
explained. _

Adam Wade
Visits A E Phi

Adam Wade, Columbia re-
cording artist, was the guest
of Alpha Epsilon Phi at its
meeting last Monday night.
President Joni Goldﬁnger and
Vice-president Sally Golboro

had arranged with Marwin Ru-
benstein, a friend of‘ Wade’s, to
introduce the singer to the soro-
rity.

The singer had returned to his

' native Pittsburgh -to appear at the

Holiday House. Three .years ago,
he was a lab technician for Jonas
Salk in tissue culture and in the
“put up lab,” where they make
the media to grow tissue cul-
tures. "
.New York Bound

Wadewent to_New York with
a friend who wanted to get some
songs "published. “I stood near
thestudio singingalon-g while he
was playing. The man who later
became‘my manager walked’ me
back to his office and asked me
if I could sing lounder. I did.

_ He signed me up.”

“In the beginningf’ Wade re-
marked, “the most difficult thing

_ of all was being nice to people
' I didn’t like.

It was all.poli-
tics, romancing, taking a guy
to dinner to wine and dine him‘,
just so they could get to, know
you.” . S .
Now ‘New York is the greatest
city in the world.”

Wade sang “San Francisco” and
“Tell Her For Me” for the group.
He gave them his latest album,

,“One is alonely Number,” signed,

“To AEPhi, the greatest‘ sorority

to remove “any” barriers which
might exist between them; fra-
ternities and sororities inviting
them as guest speakers; and_SG

_and other organizations appoint-

ing them to committees which
might be of interest to them.

This proposal was stimulated by '
Vijay Jain’s article in the Sep— -

tember 17 issue of ThePitt News.
Nancy Roland headed the investi-
gatory committee.
Libary Hours
‘.JoAnn Janos presented thevpro-
posal for the extension of library
hours for approval before it was
taken to the deans of the various
schools. The library is essential
for the University’s-primary aim
of academic achievement, the pro-
posal states. 'l\‘Iore time to use ref-
erences for papers and for sup-
plementary reading, quiet places
to study, and hours on Friday
night to prepare for Saturday
classes are means -to this end.
, The proposal calls for all sec-
_tions of the library to be open
from 8' a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday
thr.oug‘h,Friday, and -from 2 to
6 p.m. on Sunday. Reference
and Reserve Rooms will be open,
on Sunday from 6 to 10 p.m_.
Saturday hours remain the came
——8:30 to 5:30 p.m.

“We hope the approval of these.
influential members of the fac-
ulty will carry weight with Dr.
Rankin and Miss Garlock," Miss
Janos concluded. ,

Steve Gershman reported that
_the Student Directory should be
on sales by the end of the week
of next Monday. “Most of the
pageshave beenrun off; it just
has to be compiled and put into
booklet form,” stated Gershman.

Letters To Be Sent
Letters will be sent to faculty
members inviting them to order
copies. Letters to the students
from the Alumni Association will
be included with each directory.
Joe Seiger reported that he
spoke to Dean Dixon about re-
funds for withdrawal from class.
Dixon stated that each refund
after the first seven days is
personally drawn up by Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld. He reported
that the administration wanted
a two week limit on withdrawal
but that he and Dean Martin
extended it. Illness, he stated,
is the only acceptable reason for
withdrawal.

4 The ﬁnancial penalty, Dixon
explained, is a check on the num-

-ber of withdrawals. When a stu-

dent signs up for a course, a seat
is reserved and an instructor is
contracted. If he withdraws,.the
seat "is vacant and the. teacher
must still be paid.

The senators also discussed
spirit and communication between
SG and the student body.

Advisor N. Ronald Pease com-
mented, “When an advisor has no
advice it means one of two things
-—either he’s bashful or the group
is doing a good job. I'm not bash-
ful."

WARTBURG COLLEGE in Wav-_

erly, Iowa, will increase its en-
rollment fr-om 1,050 to 1,300 in

 ,___Violin-Piano Program ‘Unified’

_ go.-5-BERNSTEIN AND RUBENSTEIN entertained at last Wednesday’s
' Midday Series in Stephen Foster Memorial. Works by Schubert,
Prokoﬁev, Webern, and Brahms composed their performance. Bern-
stein played over 100 concerts for UN troops during the Korean War.

By JUDY ROSENTHAL '

,, Midday Series presented a, uni-
ﬁed performance by Sylvia Rosen-
berg. and Seymour Bernstein,
piano-violin _duo, last Wednesday
in Stephen Foster Memorial. "
During the beginning of the first
piece of the afternoon, Schubert’s
Duo in A Major, the violin

, seemed to be the instrument of

n__*\

 

primary importance, with the
piano, assuming. an almost sec-
ondary role. Bernstein kept his
keyboard instrument in the back-
ground, while the ,volin’s fullness
echoed throughout the _small audi-
torium. ‘ '

As the work neared the third
and fourth movements, the con-
trapuntal effect was clearly rend-
ered by the artists, with the piano
alternating in the ‘deliverance "of
trills with the violin.

Some Weak ' Tones

Although there were some weak

 

low tones emitted in the playing
of the violin, during the last half
of the work’s presentation, Ruben-
stein reinforced ‘ the string sounds

with clarity.

Rosenberg allowed her instru-
ment its deserved fullness at the
commencement of Prokoﬁev’s
Sonata in D Major. This fire-

contemporary piece afforded the
players a chance to perform in
welcome unity, with the piano
meeting and complementing the
tonal qualities of the violin.

A muddled third movement was
balanced by the duo’s realization
of the deserved combined power
of the piano and violin. The in-
strumental partnership was ap-
parent in the last moevment and
through Rubenstein and Rosen-

4berg’s artistry, the individuality

of string and keyboard was re-
tained.

Webern. Contrasted
Webern’s modern Four," Pieces,

Opus 7 contrasted with the fi-'

nal work, Brahm’s Sonata in

D Minor.'The short, contemporary
Webern composition afforded the
audience an interesting listening
experience, and the artists gave
a beautifully coordinated rendi-
tion of the piece.

Brahms’ work was written, as
Miss Rosenberg explained, “in
typical sonata. form.” The fam-
iliar classic harmony and senti-
mental sound was fluidly per-
formed by the two artists.

Bernstein’s ﬁrm touch on the
piano combined with Rosenberg’s
light handling of the violin to
‘produce a wonderfully even tone.
Brahms’ soothing melodies were
smoothly delivered by the violin-
ist, while pianist Bernstein pro-
vided the needed background
strength.

The piano-violin duo of Bern-
stein and Rosenberg joined in ﬁrm
concordance for the Brahms work
and made their last presentation
the highlight of the afternoon’s

performance.

How can you become an Air Force Oﬂicer?

If you are a college senior and not currently
enrolled in ROTC, Air ‘Force Officer Training
School provides an opportunity to qualify for
a wide variety of career ﬁelds. The graduate of
this three-month course receives acommission
as a second lieutenant. As the Air Force
continues its technological advance, officers
with college training will move into positions
of increasing importance.

Among the young people being graduated from
college in these times, there are some who think
and feel—perhaps a little more deeply than the
others—about the world we live in, the future
we face. They ask, “How can I make my career
really meaningful‘? More than just personally
rewarding?”

There was confusion over the
ﬁnal tally. Everyone thought
Cuthbert had scored again, when
the ball appeared to have ricoch-
eted off his forehead and dribbled
in, but the ofﬁcials credited Sam
Donatelli with the shot. The score

 eeson’s Quick Thinking Vital

By

BOB SMIZIK

Ricky Leeson, after having played perhaps the poorest

«offensive game of his college ‘career, was a most happy

fellow in the dressing room Saturday after the Panthers had

just defeated UCLA, 8-6.

Leeson’s game was wrapped up
in one play and that play was the
ball game. After Paul Martha had
scored the Panther’s touchdown
on a six-yard run, Leeson stepped
back to kick the extra point, with
Jim Traﬁcant holding.

“I saw the snap was too high
and I knew if we kicked it would
be blocked,’’ Leeson said. “I guess
Jimbo (Traficant) thought the
same thing because he started to
run with the ball. I had? to make
a snap decision. I could either
block or go out for a pass.

“I ﬁgured the guys up front
wouldn’t know -to go out ‘because
they couldn’t see what was going
on in the backﬁeld. So I ‘went
through the line and cut across

but to the surprise of no one,
especially Panther Joe Kuzneski,
they went for two points.

Crashing from his right spot,
Kuzneski spotted Kermit Alex-

ander‘ slipping out into the flat.
Kuzneski stayed with him, per-

mitted the Bruin back to take the
pass and then nailed him.

Both teams threatened again as
the second half was a direct con-
trast to the dull ﬁrst half. Pitt
marched down to the Bruins two
before Bob Roeder fumbled.

’ UCLA missed a field goal from
the 29 and had another drive stop-
ped when Marty Schottenheimer,
who along with Bob Sorochak and
John Draksler were defensive
standouts, intercepted for the win-
ners. A few plays later the clock
ran out. .

A "justifiably proud defensive
coach Frank Luaterbur admitted
that "‘Schotty deserves special
mention, for his interception, but
it was a team effort all the way.
Both lines were great. It was a
ﬁne two team showing.”

The ﬁne two team showing gives
the Panthers a 3-2 mark to take
against Navy next Saturday.

Dave Eichenlaub Nears

vSchool -Frosh Record

By JINI O'BRIEN
Cross-country coach _C_arl Rees is already exalting his
ﬁne frosh harrier, Dave Eichenlaub, who scored a fighting
ﬁrst place over a triumphant Penn State in the team’s only

outing earlier this month.

'Eichenlaub ran the 2.8 mile frosh course in Schenley
Park in 13:29.6, the second fastest time ever recorded there.

Rees noted that Vince Timon,¢

vwho traveled the same distance in
13:25 a few years ago, was oneof
the finest cross-country runners in
Panther history.
Timon ﬁnished
third in t h e
IC4A c h a m
pionships as a
sophomore.
_ With only a
-half —mile left
in t h e race,

passed one who

Carl Rees

overcame the last man at the
crest of Flagstaff Hill.

He outlasted State’s Geoffrey

Webb, a British import, by 3.4
seconds, and Fred Swanson by 22

_1._.&§}econds. George McCorma_ck was

fourth for the young Lions, who
won, 22-39. _

“Eichenlaub’s a hypocondriac,”
Rees said, “but he’s a good com-
petitor, and he showed me an aw-
ful lot of stuff.” '

Pool Attendance
Increases-—Savs

Coach Bob Lewis

Coach Bob Lewis, the director
of Trees Pool, reports that there
“has been a '-scent. upsurge of in-
terest in the pool which I feel
will continue throughout the win-
ter.”

Recently r e l e a s e d‘ statistics
show the increase. From Sept. 21-
30,646 men and 204 women used
the pool. From October 1-14, 1418
men and 604 women enjoyed the
facilities of the new building.

“I think as the weather grows
colder, more and more people
will use the pool,” Lewis said.
“Now that the weather is warm
and there is still a good bit of
daylight people ﬁnd things todo
outside. But as the days ggrow
shorter and the weather‘ colder
the increase in the pool’s use
should grow stronger.”

The pool is open for recrea-
tional swimming from 8330 a.m.
to 9 p.m. during the. week and
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Satur-
days and from 1-5 p.m. on Sun-
days. On days of home, Pitt foot-
ball games the pool is closed. .

Three students from the

foreign students from Penn-

guests of Clairion Borough
and Clarion State College for
a Global Neighbors Day the week-
end of October 12.

Representing th e University
were Doreen Ryan from Australia,
Vassanth K. Bhat from India, and

,HanNyo from Burma.

_Each of the thirteen students
had a student host for the week-

, end, as well as a family in Clarion

to stay with.
Celebrating Festival
The borough was celebrating its

'.Autumn Leaf Festival and the

college its Homecoming that week-
end.

Highlights of the weekend in-
cluded dinners, a reception with
their hosts and Clarion’s dean

.0! students, Dr. Darrell F. Rish-
el, and a parade in convertibles
before the Clarion-Edinborough
football game.

-“It was the first football game’
I had ever been at,” said Bhat,
“and I found it very exciting,
much rougher than soccer.” Clar-
ion won, 21 to 20.

Attended Dances
That evening the foreign stu-

dents attended dances at the high ‘

school and the college. One high-
light of the colegc dance, HanNyo
recalls, was the singing and trom-
bone playing by the dean-of stu-
dents, Dr. Rishcl.

India, Burma, France, Austra-
lia, West Germany, Virgin Is-
lands, Tanganyika, Japan, Hong
Kong, Spain. Uruguay were re-
presented by students.’

“This is the first time foreign
students here have had a chance
to visit Clarion for the festive
weekend,” HanNyo said.

“I think this is better than just
staying here,” he added. “In ar-
ranging for the visit, our Office
of Cultural and Educational Ex-
