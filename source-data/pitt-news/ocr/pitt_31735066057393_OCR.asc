New public safety director chosen

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

The Department of Public
Safety, without a full—time
director since March
1993, has found its replace-
ment.

Rick Boyd, the former
head of public safety at
Michigan State University
and most recently the direc-
tor for the Michigan Sheriffs

Association, was chosen to
replace William Brennan
and will begin work on
Monday.

Boyd was not available for
comment.

Cathy Klintworth, who
worked with Boyd for over a
year at the Michigan Sheriffs
Association, said she was
sorry to see him go.

“He’s a terrific guy and a
wonderful administrator,”

she said. “He’s very dedicat-
ed and he’s responsible. He
will be a great addition to
Pittsburgh.”

Boyd also worked as
the undersherrif at the
Ingham County Office of
Sheriff, outside Lansing,
Mich., and his co—workers
there had high praise for
him.

Incoming students bring variety of new thoughts

By Marc Miller
Staff Writer

The 1994-95 school year is
upon us, which means a new
group of freshman with a
variety of insights, attitudes
and experiences have begun
recolonizing the University
of Pittsburgh.

What do these freshmen
think?

According to an informal
survey released by the Office

of Public Affairs, “more
than 60 percent of both the
men and women respond-
ing felt that the mother
should be the primary child
caregiver.’’ ‘

Aaron Wevodav, a fresh-
man, felt that “children
should be 75 percent the
responsibility of the woman,
and 25 percent the responsi-
bility of the man.”

The organizers of the meeting are calling
for an end to the U.S. trade embargo and
for the normalization of relations with
Cuba. However, those with differing
opinions are welcome to attend.

according to the survey.

Volunteering
can help to
provide
experience

By Erica Glasspool
For the Pitt News

When Dominick Sciulli
shattered his fibula and dis-
located his ankle in the 1993
Blue—Gold football game. he
also shattered his dream of
becoming a pro football
player.

With four surgeries behind
him and four months until
the start of his senior year.
Sciulli decided he needed to
start working on his psy-
chology major, and his
future. « .

But how can students dis-
cover all the possibilities
that exist in their major and
then decide on one they
could do, and possibly
enjoy, for the rest of their
lives?

One answer is volunteer-
ing.

Sciulli spent his summer
volunteering for Western‘
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic by combining his
major and love of athletics
to help mentally ill patients
play games, exercise and use
weights correctly.

Eight weeks after visiting
the Student Volunteer
Services at WPIC, Sciulli is
now thinking of attending
graduate school for psychol-
ogy and recreational therapy.

“Volunteering has helped
out a lot,” said Sciulli, “you
get to see things done first-
hand and there’s no better
way to learn then that.”

Fifth-year senior Jim
Boots, also a volunteer a
WPIC, agreed.

“Volunteering was the sin-
gle most influential thing
career-wise” for him,
according to Boots.

TV].”

On the other hand, Kami

student, said she agreed that

CAIRO — While agreeing
that the increasing population
growth is a serious problem,
the Vatican told a United
Nations conference yesterday it
will not make major conces-

On the second day of the
U.N. Conference on Population
and Development, representa-

stressed their position against
the use of contraceptives would
not change.

Vice President Al Gore, who

DUBLIN — Irish Prime

The meeting with Adams and
Irish nationalist leader John

called a cease-fire last week.

The agreement by Reynolds
to join the talks represents a
breaking of ranks with Britain,

President Clinton savored the

he prepared to head back to

American intervention in
Haiti has become an increas-

the refusal of Haiti’s military
rulers to honor a U.N.-brokered

Asked about the likelihood of

LOS ANGELES — A myste-

was forced to cut short its Los
Angeles—to-Mexico cruise, and
the U.S. Centers for Disease

Piﬂfrofessor likes large classes, marathons and no notes

By Gigi Potente
For The Pitt News

Mid-life crisis is the opening topic
of the day’s lecture for Dr. Frank
Colavita’s Psychology 0015 class.

Colavita does not drive fancy
sports cars or try to wear
“Generation X’s” trendy clothes, but
with a microphone in his hand and
lively pacing on the stage, he admit-
ted. “I chose to wear love beads, but
I button my collar so no one will see
them.” The class chuckled.

Colavita started teaching for the
University of Pittsburgh in 1966,
and, although he said he has found
his “groove” in Pittsburgh, he is not
a native of this area.

On a track scholarship, he attended
the University of Maryland at
College Park; in his office hangs a
large display of his medals and
awards.

In fact, Colavita said he partici-
pates in The Great Race and the
Pittsburgh Marathon and said he is

professor Frank Colavita

Colavita received his graduate
school degree from the University of
Indiana in Bloomington, where his
three children were born.

Colavita is one professor who is
greatly appreciated by his students
for his unique teaching methods. I

“I have stopped using notes so that
in fact I can be spontaneous, make
eye contact and  demonstrate a
kind of ‘enthusiasm that is not possi-
ble if you’re tied to a set of notes,”
Colavita said.

His preference in teaching is in the
larger classroom.

“I’d rather teach a large class than
teach a small class. It’s a real chal-
lenge to keep [each student] awake,
alert and interested,” Colavita said.
“If I can do that  then [it’s] a real
source of satisfaction.”

“I’m very happy with the way
teaching makes me feel and the
response I get from the students.”
Colavita added.

Colavita said he doesn’t think his
methods are much different than
those of other professors. He said he
always tries to do his best and his
students detect this. Therefore. they
give their best in return.

According to Colavita. he tries to
develop a “mutual respect” with
every student.

Last year, Colavita received his
best teaching evaluation since 1966.
Hesaid that he always receives
“great evaluations,” but last year’s
was “off the board.”

Currently, Colavita is doing
research on teaching and learning

might be a little overwhelm-
ing at first, but it’s actually
relatively easy.

Most of the medically ori-
ented facilities near cam-
pus require volunteers to
attend an orientation, vol-
unteer a minimum of three to
four hours per week and to
receive a tuberculosis test.

To be a volunteer at
UPMC, all you have to do “is
be able to give three hours
once a week and be enthusi-
astic,” said Naomi Herman,
director of volunteer and stu-
dent services at UPMC.

UPMC offers positions in
subjects ranging from med-
ically related areas such as
pharmacy, nursing, sociolo-
gy, nutrition and physical and
occupational therapy to
accounting/finance, journal-
ism, marketing and restaurant
management.

“We have opportunities in
almost any major due to
UPMC being like a small city
unto itself,” said Herman.
“Any student needs to be
exposed to skill-building and
teamwork.”

UPMC offers six orienta-
tions during September
where 250 or more positions
for the fall term are filled.
Orientations are held at the
beginning of each semester.

Currently, there are 53 Pitt
students who volunteer a
minimum of four hours per
week at the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute; 35 work
with patients and their fami-
lies, 15 volunteer in the labo-
ratories and three work in
administration.

Most ‘of the volunteers
choose to work in the Patient
and Family Support program.
These volunteers do anything
from helping outpatients and
their families feel comfort-

able during a visit to instruct- .

ing patients on skin care and
wig-wearing to help counter-
act the cosmetic side effects
of cancer therapy.

A four-hour patient support
training workshop is
required for this program. ‘

‘The Laboratory Research

program gives qualifiedlvo1- _

unteers (according to their
education, experience and
background) the opportunity
to work with experienced
researchers and medical staff
throughout the Biomedical
Science Tower.

Thisprogram is one of the
more sought-after choices,
and there is presently a wait-

Opinions

Peace in Ireland?

In an historic announcement Aug. 31, the Irish Republican
Army declared itself willing to cease its terrorist war and begin
peace talks. This is generally viewed as the most hopeful step
towards peace in Northern Ireland since what the Irish call “the
troubles” began 25 years ago.

The cease—fire has held so far, and there have been other hope-
ful signs. Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds began unprece-
dented talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams yesterday.
These meetings end a long official ban on contact with Sinn
Fein, the political arm of the IRA.

However, not everyone is joining in the exuberance. British
Prime Minister John Major is not willing to talk with Adams
until he has assurances that the cease—fire is permanent.

This is unwise grandstanding on the part of Major. Even if the
I.R.A. were to give such assurances, it would be incredibly naive
to expect_ it actually to maintain a cease-fire if talks break down,
especially after 25 years of violence. And what would John
Major truly gain by getting such assurances? If the IRA did
resort to violence, he could denounce them as liars and gain
political points. But for Major to hold out for possible political
gain in the future, while threatening the best chance for peace in
25 years, is pure foolishness. .

Furthermore, the IRA leaders themselves are under pressure to
produce. Many of the current Sinn Fein leaders gained promi-
nence after a collapsed cease—fire in 19.75 and rose to power by
condemning older IRA leaders for proclaiming that cease-
fire. 0‘

The Pitt News urges John Major and the British government
to meet the IRA halfway and begin substantive talks on peace.

Speak out on Cuba

There is a town meeting tonight on the Cuban crisis in G-24 of
the Cathedral of Learning at 7:30 p.m. The purpose of the meet-
ing is to discuss the United States’ latest policies toward Cuba,
including the interning of thousands of Cuban refugees in
Guantanamo Bay and the tightened economic embargo.

The organizers of the meeting are calling for an end to the
U.S. trade embargo and for the normalization of relations with
Cuba. However, those with differing opinions are welcome to
attend.

“We encourage people with different beliefs to come and find
out what we have in common,” said Lisa Valanti, founder of the
Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition. Speakers include several Pitt profes-
sors and John Cox, the Socialist Workers’ Party candidate for
the U.S. Senate.

This is an excellent example of the opportunities available for

I Pitt students to transcend their academic studies and personal

lives. As college students, we live somewhat insulated lives, and
it is important to find out about and participate in the events of
“the real world.” Strong attendance may bring more events of
this kind to Pitt’s campus.

Too many’ cliques on Pil1's campus

imon and Garfunkel had

the right idea when they

wrote “The Sounds of
Silence,” because that’s how
Pitt sounds about now. There
are things going on, things
not going on and things that
should be going on that sim-
ply are not. But worst of all,
no one seems to care. Why?

.Well maybe, just maybe,

because no one knows —
consciously that is ~—— that
this silence exists. If this is
the case, the problem is easi-
ly rectified.

Now, I don’t know if I’m
the only one who has noticed

I think the underlying ele-
ment here is we need to stop
pointing fingers and realize
one crucial thing: we are all
Pitt studentsll That, and that
we are all members of this
thing called the human race.

OK, maybe being a Pitt stu-
dent doesn’t mean much to
you, but it should. You are
paying money to come here,
you are spending several
years of your life here. When
someone asks you what col-
lege you go to, do you say,
“Pitt, but it sucks.” C’mon,
why did you come here then?

a problem worth addressing.

We need, however. to admit
there is a problem. If we
don’t do that, then the prob-
lem is just as goodas dead
(and we don’t want to end up
like that organization called
Congress, do we?). Noticing
segregation is the first step
toward integration. In the
1940s and back, no one
thought segregation was a
bad thing, if they thought
about it at all, and my fellow
students, that’s where we’re
headed. ,

I realize that sounds a bit

too overused), but here we
are, segregating ourselves so
much that what is left is a
cocky individual or two.
There are the racial cliques
(“black,” “white,”

could go on, but I’m afraid of
reaching the nose—pickers,
non-nose-pickers category.
That’s one place where even I
fear to tread.

Yes, Pitt is a big place, I
realize that. Yes, people will
hang out with the people they
want to hang out with. But to
coin the phrase, “Why can’t
we all just get along?”

why did we all come here?
We blacks, whites, Asians,
etc., only to ignore the fact
that we are all here. Why is it
that I never see any racially
integrated groups of people
on the Cathedral lawn, at a
Frat party, at the “O”? Am I
simply not looking hard
enough, or is it that what I’m
looking for isn’t really there?

If no one else -notices this
problem, maybe it isn’t a
“problem” after all. Maybe
everyone on this campus is
absolutely fine with the situa-
tion, maybe living in the
1800s is swell with everyone.
And yet, if even one person,
one, among this colossal
place we call Pitt, is unhappy,
is feeling left out, then this is

people are
ignored by certain others. I
can’t point out all the
instances, I can only say I
know it exists by virtue of
my few years here as a stu-
dent. Maybe you think it’s
paranoia, and that very well
may be, but don’t ignore
what your eyes can tell you.
If you see what I have seen
during the term, don’t ignore
it. Silence is deadly (I know,
I know, I’m full of cliches).
But we are a campus, not
a bunch of little colonies.
We are the University
of Pittsburgh, and it’s up to
us to make it what we want it
to be. Kum Bi _Yah, my lord

Walton a
teacher
at every
level

OFITICI
Columnist Fm
Tom All-
Schneider American

tight end Joe
Walton began a new chapter
of an intriguing life story last
Saturday when he took the
field as a head football coach
for the first time in five years.
Walton’s return to the side-
lines has garnered much atten-
tion — not just from every
local media outlet, but also on
a national level. USA Today
dedicated a sports cover story
to Walton, and a recent article
in Sports Illustrated examined
him in his new role as coach
of Division l—AA Robert

Morris College in RMC’s first .

year of football.

Watching the former New
York Jets head coach as he
paced the sideline at
Waynesburg College’s College
Field during RMC’s 24-l9
victoryconjured up images of
Walton in his last venue as
offensive coordinator of the
Steelers —— albeit with a few
subtle differences.

There were not 55,000
screaming, “Terrible Towel”
waving Steeler fans surround-
ing every comer of the playing
field. Rather, a modest crowd
of 4,000-5,000 Waynesburg
and Robert Morris fans looked
on, all situated behind the
Waynesburg sideline. Behind
Walton and his band of
Colonials stood a six-foot
high chain link fence separat-
ing them from railroad tracks
running the length of the field.

No loud fanfare blasting
from the sound system at
Three Rivers Stadium, just the
occasional ear—splitting toot
from a passing locomotive.

Despite the considerable
media attention given to this
game, there were not many
recognizable faces in the
booth at College Field 
although the public address
announcer did sound remark-
ably similar to Floyd the bar-
ber.

But those are just material
discrepancies. Football is a
game. It is a game no matter
where it is played, no matter
how many people watch it and
no matter how much money
the players make. That is what
makes it great.

In addition, there are a few
select individuals to whom
football exists not just as a bi-
weekly paycheck, but an inter-

‘nal desire. Those who are

capable of excelling at its
highest level. but happy to
exist at any level. Joe Walton
fits into that framework.

No. 1 Stanford invades Field House

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

The best team in the Big
East the last six years, the Pitt
Panthers, have a chance to
prove to the rest of the country
that their conference is no joke
in volleyball.

Begor is not concerned. ,
“We’re excited,” Begor said.
“It’s always fun to have an
opportunity to play a great
opponent. I don’t think any-
body will back off because it’s
a no-lose situation. We’re not
expected to win, we’re proba-
bly not expected to play them

With the stigma of champi-

“Obviously, we know we’re
playing an exceptional oppo-

Begor said. “Not only are they
probably the best team in the
country, but they may be the
best collection of collegiate
volleyball players to be on one

Although overmatched,

in order to be competitive

“I think they’re [Pitt players]

Move nets
Young
coveted

p/aying time

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

Tyler Young has always
been a Pitt fan. He loves the
school, the city that surrounds
it and even the Steelers.

Therefore, it should surprise
no one that the most memo-
rable moment in Young’s
entire two-year football career
at tradition-rich Notre Dame
was walking into Pitt Stadium
to play the Panthers in
1992.

“Just walking on the field,
being back in Pennsylvania,

being back home, it felt really_

good,” Young said. ,

So good that later in the
same year he decided to trans-
fer from Notre Dame and
come to Pitt, where he can be
content playing on the side of
the ball that suits him best —
defense.

At Notre Dame, Young was
bounced across both sides of
the line of scrimmage. As a
backup to future NFL No. 1
draft pick Bryant Young, the

 

Matt Serlin/Staff Photographer

Young switched from end to tackle during preseason camp.

Irish coaches thought Young’s
best opportunity for playing
time was on the offensive line.
Young never took to the
switch.

When he was moved back to
the defensive line, Young
found himself watching from
the sidelines far more than he
cared to. It was time for a

change.

“I felt like I wasn’t getting
the playing time that I thought
I deserved,” Young said.
“[The Notre Dame coaches]
moved me back to defense in
the middle of the year, and
they never played me. I fig-
ured they weren’t gonna play
me anymore, so I decided to

. ' ¢ ' . , u a » ' 1

 

leave and do something I like
rather than something I don’t
like.”

Notre Dame’s loss has
turned into a plus for Pitt.

When Young left Liberty
High School in Bethlehem,
Pa., where he recorded 103
tackles and 13 sacks in a
senior year that earned him
USA Today honorable mention
All—American status, his list of
college choices narrowed to
Pitt and Notre Dame.

A couple of years later he
realized he had picked the
wrong school.

Under NCAA transfer rules,
Young sat out the 1993 season
at Pitt and was only permitted
to practice on the scout team.
Young bided his time, worked
on his pass rushing technique
and lifted a ton or two of
weight. He increased his
bench press to 400 pounds
(ranking second on the team)
and his squat to 600 pounds
(tied for third).

Young itched to play in live
action with his teammates.

“It kinda sucked,” Young
said. “It was tough standing
on the sidelines, watching
everybody play. But I knew
my chance would come.”

“Someone like that isn’t
your usual scout team player,”
Pitt center Lawson Mollica
said. “Tyler was a challenge
for me every day. There was
no slacking against him or

More practice time on agenda for tennis teams in

attempt to scale Big East Conference

By Vicki Geubtner
and David Saliba
The Pitt News
1
Hard work and more hard
work is needed in order to see
the University of Pittlsburgh’s
1994-95 men’s and women’s
tennis teams climb the ranks in
the Big East conference.
Head coach George
Dieffenbach will be spending
. more time
at the Cost
C e] n t e r

9'  preparing
‘\ -’  forla win-
nin season.

“ I t

is going to

 

take a lot of hard work [to

improve from last year],”
Dieffenbach said. “We are
going to be disciplined this
year, putting in more hours
practicing during the week.”
Putting in more hours is only

part of what will make a very
young men’s team become
successful. After graduating
two of the top six players from
last year, experience is some-
thing that the men need to
gain. ‘

According to Dieffenbach,
sophomores Braden Doherty
and Brad Wade ,respectively,
are the top two players and are
team leaders.

“Braden and Brad were defi-
nitely team leaders last year,
but it was Dave Dumpel who
really got us started in the Big
East championship to start
winning some matches,”
Dieffenbach said.

Dumpel, a junior, is listed
third behind Doherty and
Wade.

“I think we are a fairly cohe-
sive unit,” Doherty said. “It
should be a good year if we
work hard.”

Wade agreed and said that

4‘

'-’i:“..%?;'

individuyal and team improve-
ment over last year is expect-
ed.

“I’m playing well right
now,” Wade said. “I’m looking
to do much better this year.”

For senior Anirban
Mukherjee, this is his last shot
at competing for Pitt.

“I’m the only senior on the
team,” Mukherjee said. “I’l1
try to do my best.”

“We have a good nucleus
coming back,” Dieffenbach
said. “I’m very optimistic
about our year. We’ll have
some new players who will
hopefully contribute.”

The women have just as
much to prove as the men.

They finished with a 10-10
record and last in the Big East.
Despite this record,
Dieffenbach expects them to
“have a winning season and
come out of last place.”

Three reasons for these

in

expectations are sophomore
transfer from Boston
University Tamara Kalesnik,
freshman recruit Fran Davis
and returning No.1 singles
player Alison Baker.

“I’m hungry to do well this
season,” Kalensik said.

She recognized that “one
person cannot carry a team,”
but said the tournament experi-
ence she and Davis bring to
Pitt will help them finish better
in the Big East.

“We’re going to put up some
W’s,” she said.

Senior captain Tammy
Keister agreed. “If the fresh-
men are as good as they’re
supposed to be, they’ll move
into the top spots and take
some of the pressure off us,”
she said.

Keister said this move will
“lay up the line-up nicely.”

last year, said she’ll be “moved
down a few notches” due to
the new recruits.

“I still hope to hold a posi-
tion in the top four,” Zielinski
said.

She said her “drive for com-
petition and being strong under
pressure” will help her game
and the attitude of the team.

Competing "against each
other and hitting with the men
are helpful ways to prepare for
other teams, Keister said.

“Hitting against the guys
keeps up our running pace,”
she said.

Keister said that because
“our hearts are into it more
than past years,” overall they’ll
be a much more dedicated
team.

women open their season at
home this weekend against Mt.
St. Mary’s. The women also
play Sept. 11 against Buffalo.

Walton -

0 From page I 3

As a head coach in the NFL,
Walton coached every game
under the most intense micro-
scope in the world -— that of
the New York City media.

As the Colonials’ new chief,
perhaps the toughest challenge
he has had to face so far is the
mysterious Waynesburg Train,
which locals believe carries
some magical powers that
bring good luck to the home
team Yellow Jackets.

The legend held up on
Saturday, as the spectral loco-
motive’s two passes brought
Waynesburg a touchdown and
a fumble recovery.

Still, there will always be a
contingent of armchair quar-
terbacks who are quick to
point out that Walton is only at
Robert Morris because he was
chased out of his last two NFL
jobs. They will say he cannot
make it in the pro spectrum
and cannot be satisfied with
his new position.

Well, for all those quick to
downplay Walton’s career
move, here’s something to
chew on:

Joe Walton is doing exactly
what he loves most.

How many of us can truly
say that?

Young’s first chance as an
official Panther came in the
spring Blue-Gold game last
April. Playing left defensive

three sacks and five tackles
and forced a fumble.

noticed.

1 i n e In a 11

to utilize his quickness on the
outside. Young had been jolt-
ed again, but it was a positive
move because tackle is his
natural position. , »

“I think he understands that
in close quarters, with his
strength and size, he’ll have a
much better chance to be suc-
cessful than being on the out-
side,” defensive coordinator
Chuck Driesbach said.

Young walked into Pitt
Stadium last Saturday to play
a football game, wearing the
home uniform for the first
time.

He had two tackles against
Texas, both for losses. Yet the
move seems to have bolstered
the defensive line. Pitt collect-
ed: three sacks against? the
Longhorns. Barndt registered
one, and end Mike Mohring
had one that was nullified by a
facemask penalty.

“He’s not a ‘Big Daddy’
Wilkinson from Ohio State
type of player,” Driesbach
said. “He’s just a good solid
football player is what he is
for us.”

The six-feet-four-inch, 265-
pound former Fighting Irish
has made as smooth a transi-
tion off the field as he has on
It

 

Linebacker Tom Tumulty
had met Young long before he
ever transferred to Pitt, having
teamed with him in the Big 33
All-Star game in 1991.

“He’s kinda quiet and to
himself,” Tumulty said. “He’s
a wholesome, likeable kid,
and we’re happy to have him
here.”

“I like him,” offensive line-
man Reuben Brown said.

‘‘I clown around with him
all the time, all those guys. I
think Tyler is a plus. He’s
gonna contribute to our team.
I think he has the ability~to be
a very good football player,
and he is gonna get better
each week.”

For now, Young is just glad
to finally have an opportunity
actually to play the game in a
position where he is comfort-'
able and at a school that’s
happy to have him.

son, we’re just trying to take
care of our side of the court,”
he added. “We’re still trying to
ﬁgure out what our best lineup
is.
“We have no control of how
good Stanford is. We just have
to work hard and prepare in
practice.”

It is no fluke that the
Cardinal are the No. 1 team in

the country. They have signed
the high school volleyball
player of the year the past four
years.

Stanford’s latest signee is
outside hitter Kristen Folkal.
Folkal, as a senior in high
school, spent this summer
playing with the U.S. national
team and started in the
Goodwill Games, in which she
was one of the most dominat-

Now

ing players on the team.
“[FolkaH ﬁsprobablythe
greatest women’s volleyball
player

the most talented player, and
she’s only a kid.”

Folkal will also play basket-
ball for Stanford. She is one of
the highest touted incoming
freshmen in the country.

Begor predicts that Stanford
will have two or three All-
Americans on its roster.

The Cardinal have a tad of
local ﬂavor, too. Sophomore
Nicki Otto is from North
Allegheny High School, in
North Hills.

Regardless of Stanford’s
hype, it is a great thrill to have
the best come to Pitt’s home
court.

‘‘It’s a great opportunity to
play the No.1 team in the
country on your home floor,

win, lose or draw,” Begor
said.

“I don’t care if it’s ping-
pong, people want to see the
No.1 team play, especially
when it’s such a resounding
No. 1 team like Stanford. 1
think naturally there will be
more people to come out and
support us.”

Another reason for the high
expectation of a big crowd is
that there will be several
events taking place prior to the
start of the match. There will
be a pizza party for anyone
who shows up about an hour
before game time.

Also, there will be sorority
events such as volleyball serv-
ing contests between sets.
