terrorist  
attack

Anthony Breznlcan

Editor In chief

Semester at Sea students visiting southern Egypt
have returned to their ship after narrowly missing an
attack by Islamic terrorists who gunned down 58
tourists Tuesday at a temple outside the city of
Luxor. '

A group of 70 SAS students arrived in Luxor
just hours after six gunmen dressed as police
ambushed tourists visiting the Temple of Hatshepsut,
according to Paul Watson, the program’s enrollment
director.

No one on the cruise was injured, though some
have described the atmosphere of the cruise as
“tense” to their parents.

Watson said the students learned of the attack
upon their arrival in the city, and they quickly took
refuge in their hotel room until Egyptian officials
escorted them to the airport the next morning for a
ﬂight back to Cairo. From there, they will travel to
the S.S. Universe Explorer, docked about 100 miles
north of Cairo in Port Said.

Watson and Jill Wright, a Semester at Sea pro-
gramming director, both said second-hand reports
indicate a group of about a dozen SAS students trav-
eling independently may have witnessed or heard
part of the assault while waiting in line for tickets to
visit the temple. '

Numerous attempts to contact the ship to con-
ﬁrm these reports were unsuccessful, though some
parents of SAS students say their children told them
other students were in the area of the attack.

With bullets ﬂying overhead, people dove to the
ground and hid behind ancient pillars as the terrorists
ignored police ﬁre and continued to empty their guns
into the unarmed crowd of tourists outside the 3,400-
year-old temple, according to the Associated Press.

Coroner reports indicate that the terrorists even
stabbed some of the injured people to death during
the gunﬁght which lasted several hours.

Police killed one gunman on the scene, but the
others escaped to nearby hills using a hijacked bus.
Police scoured the area and exchanged fire for sev-
eral hours before killing the remaining ﬁve terrorists.

Police identiﬁed one of the terrorists as part of
an Islamic fundamentalist group that claimed
responsibility for the attack, according to the
Associated Press. In a letter faxed to a Western news
agency, the group claims it wanted to take hostages

500+ students and locals view quilts in union, many in tears

Zachariah Btott

News Editor

Hundreds of students and local
residents, many of whom were weep-
ing quietly into bunched—up tissues,
walked slowly and solemnly through
three rooms full of quilts honoring
those who have died of AIDS.

This was the scene in the
Kurtzman Room, Assembly Room,
and Ballroom of the Union yesterday,
where the NAMES Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt was being displayed
for the ﬁrst of three days at Pitt.

The quilt is made up of over

40,000 12 feet by 12 feet panels, but
only 65 of these panels are being
shown at Pitt. These 65 squares honor
520 people who have died of AIDS.
Each square is comprised of eight

smaller panels that are made for a sin- A

gle person. Many of these panels are
colorful, with pink and green material
cut and sewn to look like ﬂowers, or
have a picture of the person attached to
it.

Among the squares being dis-
played in the‘ union are a few with
celebrities, including Pedro Zamora,
from "The Real World: San
Francisco"; Arthur Ashe, a tennis star

of the '70s and '80s; Freddie Mercury,
the lead singer of the band Queen; and
Ryan White, a young AIDS activist of
the rnid-'80s. I

The Pitt Program Council is
responsible for bringing the quilt to the
University. Katie Fischer, the Arts
Director for the Pitt Program Council,
said it took about a year of planning to
get the quilt at Pitt, but the support for
it was very strong.

“Lots of people were volunteering
to help work [displaying the quilt and
answering visitors’ questions] ,” she
said. “Everyone was more than willing

Staff Writer

Beth Grube listens to the man's
soft voice on the tape and becomes
entranced by his dream—like instruc-
tions.

"Imagine you're walking on
clouds. And they are taking you to
an imaginary forest where you can
hear the sounds of bees from gold-
en, honey flowers ..."

Her whole body is relaxed and
she no longer feels that she is sitting
in her tension control class with
four other students. Instead, she has
temporarily disengaged from her
body, allowing herself to enter the
speaker's imaginary world.

"1 was ﬂoating
around the room," H.’
said Grube, a Pitt
sophomore, who
uses this meditation technique to
enhance her performances at swim
meets. It allows her to be more men-
tally ﬂexible in rough situations.

Meditation is just one example
of a "holistic approach" that stu-
dents are adopting in order to con-
trol the stresses of college life.

Holistic health practices, which

:|‘I

focus on the mind, body, spirit, and"

emotions as one entity instead of
separate components, have been
around for thousands of years, but
have gained recent popularity with
the dramatic results achieved with
chronically ill or injured patients.

The practices are used to treat
all facets of life such as ‘constipa-
tion, asthma, depression, acne,
colds, headaches and PMS.

This article, in a three-part
series, will focus on holistic meth-

ods, such as yoga, t'ai chi, medita-
tiongmassage, acupuncture, aro-
matherapy and diet and herbs, all {

that have improved the overall
health and well being of Pitt stu-
dents and faculty.

YOGA

With Enya's Gaelic verse play-
ing through Trees Hall Dance
Studio, Susan Gillis' yoga class
attempts the various postures of this
ancient practice.

"Just when you think you can't
go any further, take a deep breath l
and you will be able to," Gillis tells
the class as they attempt the "T—bal-
ance" posture. 1

This pose is ,
when the weight is
distributed on one
hand and one foot,
the hips are off the floor, and the
body is parallel to the wall, looking
like the letter "T."

While some students achieve the
pose quite easily, others struggle to
maintain their balance and the even
ﬂow of inhaling and exhaling.

"I love yoga," said Nora i
Romanoff, a junior who has been 1
practicing yoga for over a year. "1
can't really describe it, but it helps
me so much with my everyday life. I
feel more vital, more energetic, and
I have a better sense of myself."

Gillis says this is the exact
result she wants to see from her stu-
dents. .

"My students are really refresh-
ing," said Gillis. "They are so ener— ,-
getic and honest. And I know they if
do go home and practice because I; .

see such a vast improve-

ment."

Jenny Hanlin, a senior,
says this is the most ﬂexible
she has been since she was
4-years old.

"I’m definitely going to
continue yoga once this
class is over," said Hanlin,

who had just shown.Gillis

her new ability to do a back-
bend. "Because of yoga's
relaxation techniques, I'm
able to juggle more this
semester. If I didn't have
this stress relief, I'm afraid
my social life would be
completely pushed out."
Even though yoga
involves a wide range of

practices, such as posture‘

and breathing techniques,
religious beliefs and a vegan
diet, Gillis says she keeps
her class on a simple‘ level
that will not intimidate stu-
dents.

"I had one student ask
me if it was alright if
Christians could do yoga,"
said Gillis. "This class is not
about religion. Yoga is
meant to awaken your spiri-

“tuality, whatever that is, and
to connect students to them-
selves."

T'A| CHI

At age 19, Ben Lo suf-
fered severe internal
injuries, and was given only
a short time to live.

Through the inﬂuence of
his friend and instructor,
Professor Cheng, he turned
to t'ai chi, the power of the
ancient Chinese meditation,

FROM PAGE 2

and was able tojheal his own

body.

Cheng had discovered
t'ai chi's healing powers
when he was in the last
stage of tuberculosis and
given only a few short
months to live. ,

His extreme devotion
and belief in the practice,
though, gave him another 50
years of life, and the ability
to inﬂuence others, such as
Lo. ’

Years later, the instruc-
tion of Cheng and Lo has
passed’ on to Stan Swartz,
who teaches 48 t'ai chi
classes a week to students
all over Pittsburgh, includ-
ing a class at Trees Hall.

"I have been doing. t'ai
chi for 24 years, and it has
allowed me to finally enjoy
my life," said Swartz, 54,
who use to be —a body
builder.

The martial art of t'ai
chi's slow, circular move-
ments are beneficial for
such things as circulation,
concentration, breathing,
and one's mental attitude.

It is not designed to heal
terminal illness, ‘even
though there have been
cases that demonstrate oth-
erwise, such as Lo and
Cheng, but it is meant to
make people aware of their
mind's power over the body.

And it's not an easy task.

"There is no immediate
cure. You devote yourself
twice a day, for 20 minutes
and in time, you will see
results," said Swartz.

Tanya Uram, a junior

/ .

who cross-registered from

Carlow College, said her,

devotion has paidoff.
"When I first came, I
had a ‘lot of lower back pain
and shoulder problems,"
said Uram. "Now I don't feel
any serious pain."
Chris Brennan, a fresh-

man, says even though he '

does not practice everyday,
he still sees the benefits of
t'ai chi.

"Ever since I injured
myself two years ago, I
haven't been able to do
much," said Brennan. "But
t'ai chi helps me to listen to
my body. It doesn't hurt any-
more when I go to sleep.

Swartz says that t'ai chi
is effective for students, not
only for healing injuries, but
as a stress reducer by "cen-
soring their minds."

"Students' minds are
always scattered‘ with
thoughts of class, activities,
jobs and relationships," said
Swartz. "T'ai chi teaches
them to focus on the
moment, to take care ‘ of
things as they occur."

Uram says she utilizes
Swartz's "now concept" and
sees improvements in her
academics and her personal
life. °

"Iusually get into this
frantic mode and think, ‘I
have to do this, and that, and
this,‘ but t'ai chi has taught
me to sit back and do one
thing at a time," said Uram.

"Also, I don't rush right
into conversation anymore,
" she added. "Now, I'm more

aware of the person's com— '

munication patterns and
what they are going
through." I V '

people are all helping.”

Michael Bongiomi, a member of the
team that brought the quilt to the University,
said the Pitt Program Council wanted the
quilt to be displayed at Pitt as a project that
promotes AIDS awareness.

Over 500 people walked among the
displayed sections of quilt on Tuesday, fol-
lowing the opening ceremonies held at
noon. Bongiorni was pleased with the
turnout.

“I’ve been impressed with the sensitiv-
ity of the Pittsburgh students,” he said.
“They were very open about family mem-
bers they lost.’’

Fischer expressed that she too was
“impressed with the turnout,” and said she

Pittsburgh residents coming to the union to

As a supplement to the display, photog-
rapher Joyce Marks displayed about 15
black and white photographs of angels that
were transferred onto a hand-colored can-
vas in the Connie M. Kimbo Gallery at the
union. This exhibit was named “Angelic
Images” and showed the “emotional side of
angels with the emotional impact of AIDS,"
according to Fischer.

The quilt will be on display in the union »

from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Wednesday and
from 11 am." to 6 p.m. on Thursday.

A handful of Pitt organizations have
information tables set up at the display,

Fischer adds that the presentation of the
quilt is free for everyone.

ATTACK

to win the release of Sheik Omar Abdel
Rahman, who is jailed in the U.S.

Egyptian ofﬁcials suspect the attack
was planned to cripple the country’s vital
tourist industry by fundamentalist leaders
who want to oust the secular government
in favor of strict Islamic rule.

Of the dead, Egyptian officials report
that 58 were tourists, two were police
officers and two others were Egyptians.
The slain tourists hailed from Japan,
Germany and- Switzerland. No
Americans are reported wounded or
killed.

Semester at Sea has accounted for all
of its almost 600 students, and awaits the

FROM PAGE 1

return of about one third of the students ’

from other parts of Egypt before leaving
for the island of Cyprus in the
Mediterranean Sea. No students have
asked to stop the trip and come home,
Watson said.

The ship will follow its regular
schedule but has doubled its on—board
security and is currently guarded by
Egyptian police at port.

The program has set up a special web
page that updates parents about the situa-
tion several times a day. Wright said
almost every student’s parents have con-
tacted the office for information.

“A lot of students called home quick-
ly to let their parents know they are fine,”
said Watson. “We’re urging them all to
contact their families as soon as possible
to reassure them.”

Judy Jacobsmeier said her son,
Matthew, called her to say he was back
on the ship and though he was not near
Luxor, he was told “some students wit-
nessed the shooting.”

“He said the trip until this point has
been pretty good,” J acobsmeier said from
her home in Honeyoe Falls, N .Y. “He’s a
little tense, but not frightened. He said he
wasn’t eager to leave.”

Vijaya Rajkotia of Chalfont, Pa., said
her son, Yogesh, a Pitt biology major, was
one of the students who anived in Luxor
shortly after the attack.

“He called us from the hotel in Luxor
to say he was not hurt, but I’m worried
about him. He wasn’t talking much, and I
think he was rather scared,” she said.
Mrs. Rajkotia stopped the interview to
answer a cal1—waiting signal. “Maybe it’s
Yogesh, she said brightly. “I told him to
call and tell us he was all right.”

When she returned, her voice was
soft. “It wasn’t him,” she said. “Any time
the phone rings I am hoping its Yogesh.
Every time it is not.”

But Patty Yaugher of Charleroi, Pa.
the mother of Pitt student Jennifer
McKnight, was more conﬁdent that her
daughter was safe. McKnight was also on
the Luxor trip after the attack.

“She called and said she was fine and
said they had a military escort to the air-
port [in Luxor],” Yaugher said. “I know
she’s safe now, and that’s my only cori-
cem.”

Underage drinking punishment a joke

Alison Novicki’

  Give Oakland homels 
Thanksgiving on Pitt’s tab

Take a “bum” to dinner next week, and make the I

University pay for it.

Did you know that this year, for the first time,
Dining Dollars won’t carry over to next semester? They
used to, when they were called Choice Dollars, but not
anymore.

Lots of students don’t use their allotted funds at the
rate Pitt prescribes. But you don’t have to let all that
money go to waste.

There are many homeless people around Oakland
who don’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving and
won’t have anything to eat. Though it might be a bit
early, you can show someone that you care, and, at the
same time, make sure Pitt doesn’t get a headache ﬁgur-
ing out how to spend your leftover money. Next time
you see a homeless person outside, offer to buy him
dinner. In fact, offer to buy him all the food he can eat

all day long.

You see, the University is certainly expecting to
have a bunch of money left over in the Dining Dollars
pot at the end of this term. But Pitt doesn’t really need
the money. It is already making money with every meal
block you buy, whether you use it or not. Pitt’s peti-
tioning the state for several hundred million dollars to
build a convocation center and a new science building.
With all that money, Pitt probably won’t know what to
do with the Dining Dollars that are left over. After all,

I the University wouldn’t have planned such a devious

and underhanded way of ripping off students, would it?
is * So, next week being Thanksgiving and all, and there
tonly being a week left after that before ﬁnals, let’s all
give thanks to Pitt for regulating our meals, since we
obviously wouldn’t know when we were hungry or how
much we should eat each semester. _

Let’s show Pitt our appreciation by advertising --
by showing outsiders howmuch we love the charred

 hamburgers in the cafeteria, and how much we love

standing in long lines in Schenley while the Pizza Hut
workers realize they .haven’t made any pizzas in sever-
al hours.

Let’s treat some homeless people, to whom we can’t
give any change because Pitt knows we can’t handle the
responsibility of carrying cash.

It is, after all, Thanksgiving, and if they can’t have
a good home-cooked meal, we can at least give them a
free one.

Remember, if you don’t use these Dining Dollars,
you lose them, and it’s not better to have bought them
and lost them than never to have bought them at all. But
then, that’s not really our choice, is it?

ﬁne of $300, and perform 100 hours
of community service. Your other
option would be to enter the new
“Underage Drinking Project” (in
place of going to court) where your
charges are dismissed, you attend a

' Beforelget intothe logistics of

MADD victims impact panel, get a
drug and alcohol abuse evaluation,
go to a few Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings, and either tour the jail or
watch an autopsy.

What would you do?

I would choose the one that
would not show up on my record
for the rest of my life. Even at 16, or
at any age under 21, most people
know enough to want to avoid a
police record.

The goal of the “Underage
Drinking Project” is to deter under-
age drinking and to deter ﬁrst-tirne
offenders from returning to the
courtroom a second time. .

These goals are umealistic and
idealistic because the founders are
assuming two things: that the so-
called “punishment” is tough
enough to deter rmderage drinking,
and that they actually consider the
“project” a punishment

They admit that this program
will not cease underage drinking all
together. Idonotexpectthatitwill
deter any underage drinking
because I think that underage
 will simply be more careful
not to get caught.

I was underage only eight
months ago. I knew where to get
alcohol, where to drink it and when
todrinkitinorderthatlwouldnot
get caught The result was that I
drank illegally ﬁom approximately
age 14 and never got caught.

I knew the consequences. I
knew that I could be ﬁned and lose
my license if I was caught

Why would I continue to break
the law ifI knew that I could get in
trouble? Even though I considered
myself an invincible and all-know-
liiig teenager, I succumbed to

» unavoidable peer pressure, which
‘everybody is subjected to at some

point. ~
Iamnotproudofthis,butat

least I admit it. _ ,

Even if I was caught and
charged with underage drinking, I
would hardly consider the require-
ments of the “project” a punish-
ment. According to the Chief City
Magistrate Wrlliarn T. Simmons,
one ofthe founders ofthe program,
it doesn’t seem like those who went
through the ‘program consider it
much of a punishment either. He
says that most of them “enjoyed it
and beneﬁted ﬁom it” '

That sotmds like the reaction of
someone who just retnmed from the
health spa.

One of the requirements of the
program is to choose to tour the
Allegheny County Jail and meet
some inmates, or to tour the
Allegheny County Morgue and
viewanautopsy.'Ihisis supposedto
make them think that “this could be
me someday.” In a country where
we are bombarded with media hype
about ‘crime and punishment, tour-
ing the jail seems pretty cool. (Hell,
IdiditwithaclubhereatPittjust
for the experience about a year
ago!) In a country where bloody,
gory honor movies make billions of
dollars off the adrenaline rush of bil-
lions of people who pay up to eight
dollars to see them, viewing an
autopsy is like watching to grass
grow for some.

If Magistrate Simmons wants
to reduce the instances of underage
drinking and keep ﬁrst—time offend-
ers from returning to his courtroom,
he’s going to have to think of some-
thing better than AA meetings and
giving free tours. ‘

THE PITT NEWS

Printed media brings tradition
and works in candlelight

Marc Nuzzo

Columnlst

Without electricity, the whole laptop-
loving, Intemet-advocating world of elec-
tronic-media maniacs would be nothing
but a blank screen. And chances are
they’d have to write a letter to get anyone
to ﬁx the problem. Reading print is a rite
this writer calls a right. (And you can
stick that in your hard drive and process
it!)

Help me out here if you can, but I’m
having trouble recalling the last time I
opened the ﬁont page of my moming
paper or the cover of a_ new best-seller and
read anything to the effect of “Sorry, this
server is currently ﬁlled with the maxi-
mtnn number of users. Please try again
later.” Someone please remind me if I’ ve
just forgotten that airlines frequently wam
passengers not to read anything until the
plane is at cruising altitude because offi-
cials aren’t sure if magazines cause the
aircraft’s landing gear to ﬂap uncontrol-
lably up and down and intermittently shut
off the engines during takeoff.

Vlrrthout the printed word, where
would the world be, after all? Well, since
there would be no maps, bus schedules or
airplane tickets, I’m not sure I could tell
you. Granted, I could have all this infor-
mation at my ﬁngertips on a portable lap-
top computer with a cellular hookup as I
stood at the bus stop, unless it rained, or
my battery went dead, or the cellular sig-
nal couldn’t reach _me, or my search
engine took 246.3 hours to ﬁnally locate
anything resembling the information I
needed (if the infonnation even was on
the Internet).

Computers are great for things like
games, statistics homework and end
tables, but they’ll never be as convenient
or as liberating as the primal word.

There are things a newspaper, a mag-
azineandabookcandothatalaptopwill
never be good for. For example, have you
ever tried to swat a ﬂy with a Powerbook
computer? Can you afford to line a small,
furry pet’s cage with computer disks, and,
if you co11ld, would you want to clean that

P It would be feasible that we could
launch an international war between
Great Britain when we deprive it of news-
papers — ﬁsh and chips don’t wrap up as
well in Macintoshes. Mexican pinatas,
made of used computer disks instead of
newspaper, would all qualify as cubist art.
The last European who tried to get rid of
mass quantities of books started a world
war (just check any history book), and we
should learn from this precedent.

There’s also a cost factor to consider

here. Have- y<.>u eve. aeeidéntallx .1~“2f!.a...

Computers themselves wouldn’t
even be around if it weren’t for books.
How do you think all those Microsoft
minions learned how to do all that stuff
they charge $2.99 a minute to teH you

all in perspective, I think it’s prudent to
look at what history would be like if we
didn’t have print media

Electronic media teaes
faster, not nearly as boring

Kris Kissel
Oplnlons Edltor

Let’s face it: Print media’s fate is
on the horizon. Computers are get-
ting smaller and smaller, cheaper
and cheaper, while on the other
hand, we’re‘running out of trees.

A quick calculation on my TI-
819564839000 shows that just the
printing of the “Lose 30 lbs. in 30
Days!” ﬂyers alone that get posted
on Oakland telephone poles will
have completely deforested the U.S.
by the next century. And folks, I
gotta tell you, I don’t care what they
say about algae; I’d be a lot less
comfortable breathing without trees.

Print media has had its time, but
now that is just about up. Books
were nice, but there is something

‘ I I better coming.
We’ll’ all be
switching over
before long.

Computers
and electronic
media are
much more
attractive ' to
y o u n g s t e r s ,
who are pick-
ing up on them
very quickly.
The average computer literacy level
of an eighth—grader is actually high-
er than the average computer litera-
cy level of 40-year-olds. Kids learn
much faster with electronic media.

‘ Of course, this might be because it’s

a lot easier for school kids to press a
“back” button on a web browser dur-
ing his parent-assigned “homework
time” than it is to hide a comic book
inside a math text. Still, you have to
appreciate the learning curve.

Printed media can become very
boring because it’s not at all dynam-
ic. When all you’ve got is one thick
book with a slow story line for enter-
tainment, you’re stuck, and it might
not end up being very entertaining.
On the other hand, when you’re
reading the “Moby Dick” online ver-
sion, a fun game of Minesweeper is
just a mouse click away.

There’s more variety with digital
media because it’s not so easily sub-
ject to censorship. Web sites can
publish pretty much anything they
want, but just try finding a hardcopy
of the “Anarchist’s Cookbook” or
plans to build an atom bomb in your
local library. It’s not gonna happen.

Digital communication has
made it a lot easier to find what you

. ~ ¢ . n u . a . ~ s » r -a r

want without a hassle. Almost
everything online is indexed and
easy to locate, and a modem and
phone line means you don’t even
need to leave your house to collect
it. There’s no library operating hours
for the working person to contend
with. And there’s never a clerk to be
embarrassed in front of when asking
for a copy of Playboy Online forth
ﬁrst time. ~

Many people (mostly women)"

like reading romantic novels. But
that’s all books let you do — read
about it. Find an Internet chat room
and you might find yourself in the
romantic story. How many beautiful
romantic stories have you heard in
the news of two people finding each
other on the Internet and getting
engaged without ever having met in
person (not even counting old men
who send little boys money to catch
a bus and come to live with them).

Online information is not only
catching up to the printed archives,
but it has already been indexed in a
much more user friendly way. Think
about it: search engines with online
instructions, or card catalogues and
Dewey decimal systems you never
learned how to‘ use in grade school?

The World Wide Web has also
fostered a new level of literacy
among young people. Not only are
kids learning to read earlier, but
they’re writing more, too. Before,
everybody knew that only a‘ select
few —— the Michael Crichtons and
Salman Rushdies of the world ——
would ever write something that
would be picked up by a publisher
and printed for the masses. Almost
everybody talks about writing an
autobiography, but few ever would.
Getting oneself" in print was almost
hopeless. But nowadays, all you
need is a service provider and some
disk space and you can build a home
page dedicated to giving everybody
in the world useless ’ information
about yourself, like your favorite
movie, your favorite color and a pic-
ture of your kids.

The fact is, electronic media has
already outdone printed junk in
almost every way. The only thing
books have on computers right now
is quantity. But watch out. Name a
book, and somebody is probably
pirating it right now.

Kris Kissel would like to remind
everybody that The Pitt News
Online edition doesn ’t get newsprint
all over your hands.

 

  Uguhh!
That really
hurts

The Pitt men’s basketball team
won its season opener Monday night,
the first in a string of nonconference
games that feature the likes of pow-
erhouses St. Francis (Pa.), Lafayette
and the always intimidating

‘ Maryland-Eastern Shore.

But before chuckling at Pitt’s
opponents and boldly achieving an
undefeated nonconference season,
consider that Head Coach Ralph
Wil1ard’s squad has a surprisingly
difficult task in front of it.

Last year, early season injuries to‘
Chad Varga and Gerald Jordan stunt-
ed Pitt’s progress and led to a 1-5
record out of the gate. This year is
looking eerily similar to last season,

as injuries to sophomore Kelliig

Taylor and freshmen John Finneman
and Kevin Leslie have decimated the

team and once again caused concern. .

Leslie went down last week with
a torn anterior cruciate ligament and
will be lost for two months.
Finneman is also suffering from knee
problems and will be out four to six
weeks. ,

‘But it’s the loss of Taylor that
will have the greatest effect on the
young Panthers. Taylor, a defensive
specialist who Willard said had
found his shooting stroke in the pre-
season, fractured a bone in his left
foot near the end of practice Friday,
and will be out at least six to eight
weeks.

The absence of Taylor, who was
second in the nation with 101_steals
last season, creates a gaping hole for
the Panthers. Sophomore Jarrett
Lockhart is now thrust into the start-
ing role after starting just two ball
games last season. Although he is a
three-point threat, Lockhart’s
perimeter defense cannot be com-
pared to Taylor’s.

Taylor’s injury also means that
junior point guard Vonteego

_ Cummings will have to shoulder

even more of the load than he was
expected to. Taylor was Cumrning’s
only backup at point guard, meaning
Cummings will be forced to play the
entire 40 minutes per game until
Taylor returns.

In other words, for approximate-
ly nine straight games, Cummings
cannot come out of the game, not for

This is the year for the
Panther wrestling team.

While the team has ﬁn-
ished among the nation’s top
30 in 12 of the past 14 years,
coaches, wrestlers and experts
agree that this could be the
year Pitt cracks into the elite
top 10. ’

‘The biggest thing that we
have this year that we haven’t
had in years past is experi-
ence,” said the head coach of
19 years, Rande Stottlemyer.
“We’ve had the same goalsfor
the past few years. We want to

~ be EWL [Eastern Wrestling

League] champs and we want
to finish in the top 10.”
The team’s goals are clear,

but it’s ironic that the presea-

son polls ﬁnd the Panthers
ranked 11 th in the country and
second in the ‘EWL (behind
Edinboro).

But the Panthers couldn’t
be happier about their presea-
son ranking; it gives them

something to shoot for. Just.

short of the top 10 and second
in the conference is not good
enough for these hungry
Panthers. They thrive on chal-
lenges and want to prove that

they are for real.

“Those are lofty goals,
believe me, it won’t be easy,”
Stottlemyer said, “but we have
a lot of talent on this team. It’ll
be an exciting year.”

The Panthers will wrestle
their toughest schedule in
years this season. They will
take on seven top 25 teams,
plus they will wrestle in the
elite National Duals tourna-

ment in which the nation’s top

16 teams will compete.

But with ﬁve of a possible
10 grapplers ranked in the top
20 at their respective weight

classes, the Panthers should '

ﬁeld their best team in recent
memory. Reaching the top 10
and capturing an EWL title are
very realisticxgoals.

Here’s a weight—by-

Execute, execute,
execute. That’s all that
Pitt football Head Coach

.Walt Harris asks for as his

team begins its final push
toward the Liberty Bowl.
It's all that has been
emphasized this week at
practice in preparation for
Saturday’s game against
Virginia Tech.

“We run our game
plan, wevdon’t bust dur-
ing the game, and we
don’t make mental
errors,” said Harris. “In
order to do that, we pre-
pare better, we execute
better.”

Lack of execution is
what hurt the Panthers as

priming for CI Hokie roast

they watched a win slip
out of their grasp in the
final 30 seconds of
Saturday’s game against
Syracuse.

“Some people would
say we didn’t play 60
minutes, but we didn’t
execute for 60 minutes,”
Harris said, regarding the
speculation that his team
wasn't a
through the duration of
the loss. “We were play-
ing hard and in some
ways we wanted to win
too much. That may be
some of the reason why
we made the mental mis-
takes on offense. I think
we were trying too hard.

' That’s why we lost that

ball game, we did not
execute, so all of our

performing p

focus now is on Virginia
Tech.”

The Hokies come to
Pittsburgh with a potent
offense that includes tail-
back Ken Oxendine and
quarterbacks Al Clark and
Nick Sorensen, but it’s
the defense that concerns
Harris the most.

“Their defense is top-
rated inside and out,
they’ve got depth, so
we're preparing for them
to storm our castle and
maybe attempt to shut us
down completely,” the
head coach said.

“Offensively, they’ve
got a quarterback who
runs the offense well, and
they’ve got a great runner
in Oxendine, and the line-
men, I've watched them

quite a few times all sea- ‘

son, playing against the
talent we’ve played
against, and they may be
as good as there is in this
whole conference and in
our league.”

Defeating Virginia
Tech is the first step on
the crucial road to a bowl
berth, but Harris looks no
farther than this weekend

when considering the
Panthers’ immediate
future.

“The point was made
about you need to give
your team some more
motivation. We’ve been

On Saturday, Nov. 15 the
Pittsburgh women’s swimming and
diving team won 12 out of 16 events
to beat the Dennison Big Red, 190-
110. The victory improved the Lady
Panther record to 3-2.

“We were pleased with the way
that different swimmers swam dif-
ferent events, we gave Dennison
some quality swims,” said
Pittsburgh Head "Coach Marian
Cassidy-Keen.

This meet gave the Lady
Panther swimmers an opportunity
to improve in various areas.
Sophomore Liz Perry, -who usually
swims butterﬂy, won the 200-yard
backstroke in 2:13.73, a full two
seconds in front of her closest oppo-
nent. Perry also placed second in
the 200-yard butterﬂy, with a time
of 2:11.33.

Senior Megan McNallen, a
freestyler, was victorious in the 200
ﬂy, swimming it in 2:10.88.
Successfully competing in the 500-
and 200-yard freestyles were senior
Melissa Burns and sophomore Beth
Grube, who often swims back-
stroke. Burns placed first in the 500
with a time of 5: 14.07, while Grube
won the 200 in 1:55.52. ,

Grube also took first place in

THE PITT NEWS

the 200-yard individual medley. She
won the event by almost three sec-
onds, with a time of 2:12.87.

Winning the 100 backstroke
was junior individual medley swim-
mer Nikki Clifford. She swam the
race in 1:00.80 and was followed by
teammate, junior freestyler Aimee
Crombie who came in second place
with a time of 1:02.45.

“Our team gave Dennison some
quality swims, we really did a nice
job,” Cassidy-Keen said. “This
wasn’t one of our toughest meets,
but meets like these give us the
chance to move our swimmers
‘around and improve them on other
events.”

Many other Pittsburgh swim-
mers gave winning performances
on Saturday. Senior Erin Bissell
took first place in the 200 breast-
stroke, swimming it in 2:24.25.
Also, senior Isabel Dejo won her
event, the 50 freestyle, in 24.57.

Juniors Samantha Chabotar and
Jen Slack also brought in Lady

Panther victories. Chabotar won the

1000 freestyle in 10:22.12, and
Slack took first in 100 ﬂy with a
time of 59.89.

Slack swam the 200 freestyle as
well, and took second place in that
event. Her time of 1:55.59 was just
seven hundredths of a second
behind the winner,

teammate '

  Women swimmers mopup the Big Red  

Grube.

Also taking a second place fin— 1

ish was senior Lindsay Swiderski in
the 500 freestyle, with a time of
5:15.15. Directly behind her was
teammate senior Kristie Opiola,
who took third in 5:15.31. _

Pittsburgh’s women’s diving
also had an outstanding perfor-
mance against Dennison. Both the
one- and three- meter diving events
were swept by Panther divers.

In the one-meter diving event,
first place was taken by sophomore
Jamie Tomazich, who scored
201.60. Taking second third and
fourth, respectively, were freshman
Amber Meek with 169.55, sopho-
more -Cheryl Anderson scoring
163.75, and freshman Erika Nim
totaling 162.20.

Tomazich also took ﬁrst in the
three-meter diving event, her score
there totaling 214.75. She was fol-
lowed by Meek again taking second

with 176.15, Nim at third with _

169.95 points, and Anderson’s score
of 152.35_at fourth place.

Coach Cassidy-Keen used this
meet as preparation for the team’s
upcoming _contest. She explained,
“We will travel to the Indiana
Invitational which comes up next
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I am
pleased with the way that we look
going into that event.”

The Pittsburgh Panthers men’s lacrosse club
defeated Miami of Ohio 14-3 ' and Ohio

University 10-9 in overtime en route to a tour— .

nament victory over Halloween weekend, cap-
ping off its fall season and leaving improving
the Panther record to 3-3. ’

The Panthers started off the weekend with a‘

drubbing of Miami of Ohio. Pitt dominated all
facets of the game and came away with a 14-3
victory. In the other early game, OU beat Penn

State by a 15-2 margin setting up a meeting ,

between Pittsburgh and OU in the ﬁnals.

The Bobcats came into the game as a
nationally ranked powerhouse. They played in
the National Collegiate Lacrosse League Final

Four last year and will probably stay in the top ,

four going into next season.

OU ‘played like a national title contender in
the first half when they took a commanding 6-0
lead over the Panthers.

. “I think we were intimidated in the first
half. Individually they had more talent, but as a
team we knew we were better,” said new Head
Coach Rob Heaps.

Pittsburgh fought and clawed its way back
until the score stood at 9-8 with eight seconds
remaining. Mark Baldwin blasted a shot that the
goalie saved. Just when the game appeared to be
over, John Lambert took a swat at the ball and
knocked it out of the goalie’s stick. 9

The ball crossed the goal line just as the ref-
eree blew his whistle, and he ruled that the goal
counted because the ball was in motion when
time expired. This gave the Panthers the confi-
dence they needed. Marc Poletricci scored the
game-winning goal in overtime to send the
Panthers home overjoyed. -

“Our coach was the biggest part of this vic-
tory. He kept us motivated through the whole
game, and this is something we will look back
to as the biggest moment in the fall season,” said
David Travis, the lacrosse club president.

Coach Heaps, a former Pitt player, has only
been aboard as head coach for this fall season.
The team decided they wanted a change last
year and former Coach Gary Neff stepped down
in accordance with those wishes.

“The team wanted more intensity and
[Neff] was more of a ﬁgurehead,” Heaps said.

Heaps expected to come in to do the job on
a temporary basis, but it seems as if his tenure
will last a bit longer than that. The players like
him and he enjoys his job. ,

He coached for the last two years ‘at Fox
Chapel High School and has played with the
Pittsburgh team for the last three years. He is
getting his MBA at the Katz Business School as
well.

“Next season, I am looking for camaraderie,
school spirit, intensity, and a commitment that
was never there. I want them to play like this is
a varsity sport, not goof off. If we do this, we
should go to the Final Four,” Heaps said.

He expects great things from this team and
they expect great things from him. The team
starts its season again in the spring with the
league schedule.

been to the NCAA tournament twice
already, his experience should make
this weight class a strength for the
Panthers. Promising freshman Blaise
Mucci will provide some much-need-
ed depth. .

, 142 —After being redshirted last
year, Mike Ziska moves back in to the
starting lineup this season. The coach-
ing staﬁ has high hopes for‘ Ziska
afterheeamed22winsasafreshman
two years ago. Redshirt junior Ben
Dings is a quality backup and gives
the Panthers an experienced veteran
to plug into the lineup.

150 — Another of the team’s
NCAA qualiﬁers from last year is
Kevin Johnson. He beat out Mike
Dixon for the starting spot at 150. But
Dixon, a starter last year at 142, is a
skilled grappler and his big match
experience adds to the overall depth

of the squad.
158 -— This is the other weight

FROM PAGE 8

class without an oﬂicially named
starter, but the only real question at
158 is how healthy Jake Schaus’
shoulder is. The redshirt junior’s tal-
ent is not an issue; he put together an
impressive 22-7 record last year and
is ranked as the ninth best 158-
pounder in the country. Schaus
injured his shoulder last year but he
appears to be fully recovered from
olf-season surgery. The other candi-
dates in today’s wrestle-offs are Mark
Gray, Brian Pardini and Josh Drewitz.

167 — Although he has never
wrestled an official match for Pitt,
redshirt freshman Nick Mengerink is
one of the most talented grapplers on
the squad. He was one of the main
reasons last year’s recruiting class
ranked as the 10th best in the nation,
and after being redshirted last year,
most expect Mengerink to step in and
be an immediate force at 167.
Sophomore Fabiano Scuillo will pro-
vide depth.

177 —— Two time All-American
John Vlrrthrow is one of the best
wrestlers in the country (he’s current-

THE PITT NEWS

ly ranked ﬁfth). He will make the
jump from 167 to 177 this year, but
the move shouldn’t disrupt VV1throw
from capturing All-American honors
for a third time. Brad Wood and Dave
Galati would be ready to step in
should Withrow get injured.

190 —— Pitt’s other two time All-
American, Mark Bodo, is also one of
the nation’s best. He’s ranked third in
the nation at 190 and is the Pittsburgh
wrestler with the best chance of
becoming national champion.

Heavyweight -— Injuries forced
Matt Mueller into the lineup prema-
turely last year, but the big guy is
readyforhisﬁrstfullyearasthe
Panthers’ starting heavyweight. The
270-pound Mueller has a wealth of
talent and has added 50 pounds to his
monstrous frame. Freshman Sean
Barkey is the number two heavy-
weight.

The Panthers open the season on
Sunday at 2:00 p.m. against unranked
Slippery Rock in Fitzgerald Field
House.

‘“They’re not an easy team, they
have ﬁve NCAA qualiﬁers,”
Stottlemyer said. “If we go out and
just show up, we could be in trouble.”

the ﬂu (that he suffered from in the opener), not
for a turned ankle, not even for a sip of Gatorade.

If there is one player on the Pitt team who
Willard has the confidence to place that kind of
responsibility on, it’s Cummings. But once teams
realize that Cummings accounts for over half of
Pitt’s points through either scoring or assists, they
will try to shut down Cummings using the latest
defensive trend sweeping college basketball: the
double team.

Once ‘teams double-team, triple-team or
quadruple-team Cummings, Pitt is left with few
other scoring options. To hope that one or two
freshmen will make substantial offensive and
defensive contributions is optimistic. But to
expect them to do so is unrealistic.

The Panthers are going to need the early sea-

 

FROM PAGE 8

' son warm-ups to monitor their strengths — and

assess their losses.

So be happy with Pitt’s early season patsies.
While the Bonnies of St. Bonaventure originally
looked like cupcake city, with all the Panther
injuries and uncertainties, they end up looking a
lot like a godsend.

Ned Schano is senior staff writer for The Pitt
News and because of his lack of athleticism does-
n’t have to worry about blowing out a knee.
