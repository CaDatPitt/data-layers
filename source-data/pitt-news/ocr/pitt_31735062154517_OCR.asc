Lipsitz Prbhoses -.
“ Student Union Plan

Deﬁnite. action‘ on a‘ proposition
made by Herman Lipsitz, _’30,.presi-
dent of the Business Ad.'_ Associa-
tion, to‘ form-a Student. Union com-
posed of-. the various school associa-
tions, was indeﬁnitely; deferred, at a;
recent meeting of administration-
and association heads. . .

The proposal provided for "the
combining of the College",-_ Engineer-.
ing, Mines‘ and Business 5.Ad. asso-
ciations into a. single" organization
to be known as Student Union,
which would serve the whole‘,Un1,-—
versity in practically the same. ca-
pacity as do -the present school.-.asso-
ciations. The Union would prepare
a budget allotting toeachschool, in
proportion to its enrollment, funds-
for social afl’.airs_.and-. student loan
service. I I _: I ' .

Although "the Business Ad. Asso-
ciation‘ favored the.}proposalf through
its president, the other ‘associations
believed thatffor the’ remainder of?
the‘ seniester,’ the '.oi‘ganizations.
should not .change, 1 inasmuch. as each
with an" increased membership has.
already worked out an ambitious so-.
cial schedule. They held that the.‘
future, position of the. associations.
could be’ better _determined after‘
each had, held its first social ‘func-
tion of the semester. Anotlier- meet;
ing of the ofﬁcers and faculty ad-
visers will probably..be"held within
the next two weeks, when it‘ is
planned to1resume.discussion of the‘
g, ‘a Student.

Lipsitz has stated ‘ that the. plan.
was. submitted b him on‘-.hi,s _.o.v‘vn
initiative, and s ould not be’c~oii-
strued as being the attitude‘ of-. the
Business’Ad. As’socia.tion.. He feels
that the Student Union would great-
ly assist. Student Council in at-
tempting ‘to create a better Pitt

spirit and to .r.emedy..the presentrsit-.

“As an alumnus and a trustee, I

A Action OI Y.M.C.A.

-The ‘‘Y_’’ but project contiiiued_a-t'
a standstillthis week with little._1n-
dicationthat any deﬁnite conclusion,
impended. Remodeling plans, _which-
if carried out, would result ‘in the
temporary transfer of offices related
to the deanlof men and student ac-
tivities to the hut, have been neither
discarded nor ﬁnally approved. _

. Don C. Shumaker, “Y” _e1_<eci1t1V.e
secretary, expressed the opinion that
next week may see a Settlement
either favorable or unfavorable to
the suggested changes, but declined
to elaborateupon his pred1ct1on.‘He
said he is undecided whether_ to call
a new conference of the principals
to reconsider_the project in the-1m-
mediate future. A. H. Armbruster,
acting dean of men, when asked
about discussion of the plans‘, de-
clared he has taken no action re.-
cently and is waiting for the Y. M.
C. A. to resume the initiative.

It is -the‘ plans of John Weber,
University b usiness manager, that.
first put the “Y” remodeling“Ipr0-
posal in deﬁnite form and 1ater.pre-
cipitated the disagreement. over the-
proper allotment of space, which re-
mains the only serious obstacle to
starting operations.

Mr. Weber, recently absent -from
the city, said on his return, “The
project. would cost money which we
do not want tospend _unl_e_ss_ both
the “Y” and student activities will
be beneﬁted. I-am leaving it en-.
tirely to them to reach an agree-
ment.”

Spent Twenty-Two Years In
F ar East As Educator,
Evangelist

  
  

 

Probably the best known mission-vi‘
ary in the world today, Dr. E. Stan-I’  
ley Jones, appears this morning bc- A I ' "
fore the first general assembly of , 
the semester in Memorial hall. He -‘ '
has‘ been‘ engaged for twenty-two A
years in intensive religious work :
throughout the Far East. I I

Beginning in India in 1907 as a...‘
missionary of the Methodist Episco-
pal church, Dr. Jones has since led
meetings in Malaysia, China, Japan
and Korea. He has specialized in.
preaching among the high-caste.
Hindus and the educated Mohamme-
dans of India. . _

In 1923- he spent several months I
in the school of Dr. Rabindrath Ta- .:
gore,.Hindu poet and philosopher,U‘.
studying culture and religions of 
India. Dr. Jones counts among l‘l.‘lS'-._ ,»
personal friends Dr. Tagore, Mah'a.t- 
ma Gandhi, leader of the home rule .
movement in India, and a number of -
otfher leaders of India’s thoughtand‘ 
l e. IA

On three separate occasions he has . _ -A I.
turned down offers of a diocese in.  . ,-;i
the Methodist Episcopal church. -
Last May Dr. Jones was actually 
elected to the office during a general _ I’ ’
ponference of‘ the church in Kansas‘ I.
‘City; he resigned, however, within. . _  ~
twenty-four hours, giving as his
reason a desire to continue his evan-
gelistic work. - He has been preach- ‘
ing every evening this week in Trin-
ity church, under interdeiiomination-‘ ’ --
al auspices.

EVXPEC.-T TOUGH BATTLE ‘

 

est Virginia, K-iski and

Wash-J eff ‘ Remain
On Schedule

An undefeated record is the ob-
jective of George Kowallis’ frosh
basketball. tearn~as it prepares for‘
the. last three games of its. 1929
schedule. The Panther cubs annexed

 

their fourteenth victory in an?’ ex-

citing game with the Tartan plebos

at thestadium last Tuesday,‘31 to ‘

Althou h .1‘.he.Tech froshifell _be- t
fore com ortable scores ingthe two. ‘

29

previous contests’ this "season, this
week’s encounter was a real battle.
Neither team was able to hold an

advantage to‘. any great length of -
time, and.the game was’ featured by '

fast ﬂurriesof basket-tossing which
kept the‘ crowd. on edge during the
entire contest. The Pitt men. led. at
the half, 19 to 17, aided by five ﬁeld
goals by S. Kowallis. . .
,; Carnegie Leads

In the third quarter the Tartan

plebes jumped off to a lead after

.Armentrout, Tech forward; started

a scoring spree whichcaused the
locals to call for time. However,
when Wrobleski tossed in two ﬁeld
goals in succession, the Pitt men
recovered their pace and, after ac-
quiring the lead, stalled the ball in
the last minute of play to grab the
final verdict, 31 to 29.

Wrobleski, with ﬁve ﬁeld goals
and four out of six free throws, led
the ﬁeld, with Armentrout, Tech
star, trailing with five ﬁeld goals
and three out hf three free throws.

Only‘ threegames remain on the
1929 schedul and two of the..op-
posing teams have been defeated by
the locals previously .this season.
The Kowallis men clash with the
West Virginia first-year men-, in a
prellrninary to the varsity game, at
Morgantown tomorrow night. The
toughest game of the season is ex-
pected and the cubs will probably
be,’compe'l1ed to show their best in
order, to keep their record clear‘.

In a, preliminary "to the varsity
game between Wash-Jail‘ and Pitt
at Washington, next-Wednesday, the
fresh will encounter ptheﬁrst-year.
Presidents. Ina previous game the
locals found little trouble- in turning
them bacl.<.§37 ‘to 19, arid Kowallis’
gangisl hoping for a similar score
in.‘ the coming game.’ The lastgarnc
of the season will ﬁnd the Cubs. op-'
. osing the Kiskilprep school ﬁve .- at

before the locals,-- 87 to 24,- earlier-

.Vet Mountaineers Favored

In First - Indoor Meet
Of -Season

 

After > putting, in". about six weeks
of more or less serious training
Frank Shea’s varsity ‘Panthers are
ready to engage. in them‘ first track
meet “of -the season. ‘Coach Art Smith
and“his Mountaineers. from--, West
Virginia will play’ -host‘ to“ the? Pan-

thers S.aturday..afte.rnoon' audit will

mark the first appearance offal Big
Four team‘ in the new West‘ Vir-

Despite the fact that Ohio-‘ State-
gave‘ the ‘Mountaineers a rather‘ se-
vere drubbing‘ last Saturday, Shea’s
athletes -willbe hard pressed. to win.
In fact they will be extremely for-
tunate‘ to win. WestvVirginis. will
have a number of veterans perform-

ers to send intoaaction against the .

Panthers.. V _ . 4.
Captain Les llfiontgomery 1s,_‘ a
crack quarter-miler and Coach‘

Smith has developed anew star at
the middle distance. in the person of
Herb Hardy who has beaten the.ca.p-
tain several times in the timetrials.
There are some otherigood men on
the/West Virginia outﬁt. Charley"
Hoult, a good half-miler; Butch
Keefer, Monroe and Ho 6: in the
pling -and
Maxwell. in. the hurdles, Charley Hill
in the quarter - andmwaggoner, a‘
sophomore ﬂash“ in the sprints.
' Glose.Mect"E’xpected

A ‘number of good ‘track and field. .
events are on the program. On the ‘

trackfthere is a seventy-yard dash,
high and low hurdle races over the‘
same distance and a one mile run.
In ‘addition three are. three relays.
The first willqbe’ a ‘mile’ relay. with
each. ,man“-running a. quarter of a
mile, the second will be a sprint
reia‘. with each man runningrone lap‘
or. 1 6 yards, and the ﬁnal will be a‘
two—.-pile affair with each man run-
ning a half.,_’_There will also be ﬁve
ﬁeld events; the shot put; the th_ir;ty—"
six ‘pound weight, the pole vault,

‘broad jump and high jump. '.

Shea ‘has a. combination of vet-
‘eranmaterial mixed up with a num-
ber of good sop'homor‘es.‘While he is.‘
not yet sure just who will compete.
in the different events there are sev-
eral men who appear certain to‘ ap-

ear“ in specialties. Captain Vic‘
,-ickard is sure to be -in the pole
vault and he. will be seconded by
Everette Utterback and Bob Stoup,
both ‘of’ whom are goo" for around
12 feet. - ‘

In the 70-ya1'.d;.dash and the sprint.
relay there are plenty of good men.‘
Pete Bowen heads the list and is a

_- sure bet to take part in both. Jim
« McC_u,1loug«h is the next best bet and
; th_ere‘are several good’ sophomore
..sprinters,

Marshall Lewis, Jay
Doverspike and Goodwin.

Places-on the mile ‘relay team will
not «be so=‘easy to -ﬁll. Again Pete
Bowen is a pretty sure bet, but the
otheiﬁthree places are toss-ups With‘.

the 1929 Panther basketball sched-
ule," will pay their respects to Coach
,Carlson’s-. Phantom. ~ Panthers in‘ a
game at. the new Mountaineefﬁeld
house at Morgantown tomorrow
night. Carlson and. his basketeers,
in\turn, are’ all set to even up the
two-game series by walloping the
West Virginia quintet.

Not only is. the Pitt mentor in-
terested in evening the 1929 score,
but the championship of the district
may hinge on the encounter.‘ Each
team has. three games. ahead of it.
In‘ order to win the title, the Pan-
thers must_‘‘ win the Mountaineer
game, and maintain the same aver-
age on the other two games as does
the West Virginia five on theirs. If
the" Panthers win. the remaining
three games,‘-, and_.,;.th,,e_—'_M,ountaineers

Mountaineers. The localycoach has
been working-. his I men; into‘ high-
speed action at practices. this-"week,
and‘. the. Panthers ‘are evidently set
for‘ the game. Wi_th‘~ the recent ad-
dition of Eddie Baker to the scoring
ranks‘ of the Pitt team, the Mor-
gantown boys‘ will be compelled to
divide“ their attentiorl; between two
of the most consistent scorers, of the
East. ‘- ~ 5‘ _ A. j ,_

honors ‘f‘o‘r“ the evening‘ ‘after he‘

‘--.Carlso}‘1’s Pitt‘ team is given an-

morrow, despite. the fact that the
locals will be ‘playing. on a. foreign
court. The Panther mentor.,has
found stronger list of ‘ ‘substitutes
than he had in the first ‘encounter
with the -Mo‘untain.eers. Ray , Mont-
gomery and Rube Anderson have
both ‘been turning in reputable

cent games.‘ .-
substitutes was decided drag on‘ the
Panther téamin the second half of
West Virginia game last month, and
with this condtiion modiﬁed, the lo-
cals are expected, to find their mark
