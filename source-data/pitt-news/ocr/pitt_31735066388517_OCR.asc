No increase in state funds proposed for Pitt

By Renee Crespy

and Jenna Ferrara
News Editors

The chairperson of the House
Appropriations Committee said yesterday that
Pitt should not receive an increase in its basic
state subsidy because Pitt officials “lied” when
the committee investigated Pitt President
Wesley Posvar’s multimillion—dollar retirement
settlement.

Under the $13.8 billion General Fund budget
for the 1991-92 ﬁscal year, which was revealed
yesterday by House Democrats, the state and
state-related universities, with the exception
of Pitt, would receive a 2.5 percent increase
in their basic instructional subsidies.

Committee Chairperson Dwight Evans, D-
Philadelphia, said last month that Pitt’s requests
for more funding would probably be denied
because Pitt officials withheld information
about Posvar’s retirement package.

According to Dennis McManus, an assistant
to'Posvar and Pitt’s lobbyist in Harrisburg,
“What in fact was misleading was the
information provided to the committee in
response to an investigation of retirement
programs on particular university
administrators.”

McManus said the committee is pressuring
Pitt to be more careful with its funds.

“The message is that they are obviously
concerned and displeased with various reports

the university's earlier response on the

retirement package,” he said.

It is too early for Pitt to respond to the
committee’s recommendations, McManus
said. ’

“We have a tough road ahead of us. The
university is going to try and show that the
funds we receive from the commonwealth
are to support the research, faculty and
education, which they do,” McManus said. I

McManus said he hopes Pitt will be treated

the same as the other public universities. “If

the university had been treated equally in this
particular proposal, we would be in line to
receive $2,964,000 for educational use,”
McManus said. “But for Pitt, it calls for a zero

in the media. They are particularly upset with I
Faculty Assembly calls

Assembly voted unanimously

The assembly passed a
resolution condemning Pitt’s
Board of Trustees for its
“unethical” behavior and
requested that the trustees force
outgoing Pitt President Wesley
Posvar to repay $700,000 in low-
interest mortgage loans. It was

" he told his superiors about deliberate under-

Campus police officer Vernon M. Barkley
filed a lawsuit against the University of
Pittsburgh, Public Safety Director William
Brennan and Vice President for Administration
John Yeager in U.S. DistrictCourt on Monday.
The lawsuit contends Brennan began
harassing Barkley after Barkley complained
to Brennan of departmental rule violations,
underreporting of campus crime and
discriminatory hiring and promotion policies.
According to the lawsuit, after Barkley

revealed the anchor tenant of the
offices would be the UPMC.

“There was a very bad set of

complained, an unnamed sergeant told Barkley
that he should be aware of “which side his
bread is buttered on," and that Barkley should
“stick with Chief Brennan.” The lawsuit also
contends that Brennan promised Barkley a
promotion to sergeant and told Barkley not to
cause problems. ‘ ,
Brennan, with the approval of Yeager‘ and
the university, “engaged in a calculated scheme
of harassment, discrimination, abuse and
retaliation” toward Barkley, according to the
lawsuit. This included denying. Barkley
promotions, reprimanding Barkley for

"allegedly refusing to obey orders and

suspending Barkley for alleged policy
violations.

Barkley also alleged that Brennan visited
Barkley’s law enforcement classes and asked
Barkley’s students whether Barkley had made

any ethnic slurs or derogatory statements"

es Brennan, Yeager

about the university. This caused Barkley’s
students to question Barkley’s qualiﬁcations,
according to the lawsuit. .

The charges of misconduct on Barkley’s
part are false and unsubstantiated, according
to the lawsuit. 1 ‘

Pitt denied Barkley due process by refusing ~.

to allow him to file a grievance about the
suspension, the lawsuit contends.

Barkley’s civil rights were violated, the
lawsuit said, and Brennan's actions are also in
violation of the Whistle Blower Law.

Barkley is seeking the removal of all
reprimands from his record, a promotion to
sergeant and an injunction to stop further
retaliation.

Brennan and Yeager were unavailable for
comment. University relations and Walt
Waters, assistant director of public safety,
refused comment. ‘

Provost
assumes
Posvar’s

job duties  

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pitt President Wesley
Posvar transferred his
duties to Provost Donald
I-lenderson on Monday.
Posvar said in a statement
he ‘would be away on.
several trips in June and

July promoting unspecified

“international and
developmental initiatives”
in preparation for his “post—

presidential service to the -

university.”

‘Posvar was unavailable
for comment. Henderson
said he did not know the
details ofPosvar’s itinerary.

Henderson said he was
surprised with Posvar’s
decision. _

“There was no reason

for me to anticipate it. "I ..

guess that looking at his
schedule, given the fact he
is going to be [traveling]”
the decisi/on made sense,
Henderson said.

John Dennis
O’Connor,vice chancellor
of academic affairs and
provost of the University
of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, will assume the
presidency on Aug. 1.

Henderson, along with 5
other top administrators, '
will be responsible for
designing the university
budget, which has to be
completed by July 1.

At the University Senate
meeting yesterday, a
motion was passed
“endorsing the action of
the board as naming Don ‘
Henderson’ : as being in e
charge of the ‘university’s
day—to—day operation
during the present period
until President O’Connor’s
official tenure. We also

pledge_ our full support of 9 V ‘

Don.”

Philip Wion-, an assistant‘  5’ ;.
professor of English and "_ ~ ‘
‘president of the United fﬁ '
Faculty, said “Provost'
Henderson will be in a"

much better position to see
us through the next few

months than President »

Posvar would have been
—-— given all the recent
revelations of late  such
as the retirement package,”
Wion said.

By Renee Crespy
‘News Editor
. A state House of

Representatives committee has

approved legislation requiring

’ state-related universities to open

their ﬁnancial records to the
public.

The University of Pittsburgh is
among the four schools which
the bill would affect.

Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
universities will also be affected
by the right—to-know law.

An amendment was also added
to include colleges and

universities that receive direct.

state funding, such as the

University of Pennsylvania and"

Drexel University.

The financial records ofthe 1/I
state-owned universities and the
community colleges are already
open to the general publ_ic, but

this proposal would make it
official.

Cowell said that while
mismanagment of funds at the
universities may not be stopped,
officials may be more careful
with university funds in the future.

“When the light of public
scrutiny is involved, university
officials are more prudent in the

_ spending choices they make,” he

said.

Pitt has recently come under
scrutiny from legislators for not
disclosing President Posvar’s
retirement beneﬁts, which add
up to $309,000annually, and his
retirement package, which
includes a lump-sum payment of
$938,000 from $3.3 million he
has accumulated in two annual
funds.

According to Cowell, that
incident, coupled with
investigations dealing with federal

research money at both Pitt and
the University of Pennsylvania,
make the bill even more
necessary. A

“What happened at Pitt 
provided additional support in
favor of the bill,” Cowell said.

‘The House Education
Committee voted 16-6 last
Thursday to send the measure to
the House for a vote next week.

Universities opposing the bill
believe that opening their
financial records to the public
would cause them to be less
competitive in attracting and
keeping faculty.

According to Rep. Ronald
Cowell, D—Wilkins, who first
introduced the bill, administrators
from the schools which were
opposed to the bill could offer no
persuasive arguments against the
measure.

Among those universities are

Cowell Bill one step closer tobeing law

Pitt and Penn State.

Pitt has lobbied against the
bill, reasoning that it is a state-
related university, not a state
agency. '

Penn State is concerned that if
faculty salaries become public
knowledge, it will be easier to
persuade some of them to move
to other institutions.

Universities that receive low
amounts of state aid should not
apply to the bill, officials say.

According to Bill Mahon, Penn
State’s public information
director, Penn State gets about
20 percent of its budget from the
state. ,

Cowell disagreed, stating that
the four state-related ‘schools
together receive a half—a-billion
dollars in state appropriations.

“I think that because of that
alone they should apply to the
Right—To—Know Act,” said Cowell.

Gender sways rts in rigbtfto-a’z'e cases a

By Matt Rettger
For The Pitt News

Court decisions in right—to-die
cases are inﬂuenced by the
patient’s gender, said Dr. Steven
Miles, a speaker at Pitt’s lithics for
Lunch last Thursday.

Miles said the courts considered
men to be rational, reflective and
passionates Women were
considered unrellective, immature
and ﬁckle. Men were depicted as
expressing strong moral
conviction, while women's
opinions were largely ignored,
added Miles.

The courts’ language portrayed
men as being assaulted by the
life-sustaining procedures, while
women were seen as requiring
their nurturing effects.

Ills examination of decisions
shows that the courts’ primary
consideration most often was
arriving at a decision which
respected the man’s personal
autonomy.

But for about half of the cases
involving women, the court

‘deferred the decision about

whether to terminate life-
sustaining treatment to the
patient’s family or guardian. Miles
said this proved that the wishes of
the patients’ guardians is the
courts’ primary concern when
deciding cases involving women.

Miles presented his examination
of 22 state appellate court cases,
8 involving men and 1/: involving
women. In each case, a party

In most right-to—die cases, the patients cannot
speak on their own behalf,‘ so the courts’
goal is to ascertain the patient’s moral
preference by constructing it using evidence

from the person’s life

——-Steven Miles

acting on behalf of the patient
wanted to discontinue treatment.

“In most right;-to—die cases, the
patients cannot speak on their
own behalf, so the courts’ goal is
to ascertain the patient’s moral
preferencebyconstructingitusing
evidence from the person’s life,”
Miles said.

“A gender pattern emerges. The
gender effect is greatest if the
court is given a blank slate to
decide,” Miles said.

The courts used the patients’
previous statements for
determining what they would
have wanted in 75 percent of the
cases concerning men, but in
only two of the cases concerning
women, according to Miles.

, Miles said that right—to-die issues
should not be decided on the
basis of gender. In states that
have right—to—die legislation, the
preamble to the law is free of
gender bias.

’l'he moststriking gender—based
pattern to emerge, according to

99

Miles, is that the courts commonly
accepted the views of the men
and ignored the wishes of the
women. ~

In the case of Mr. Gardner, 23,
adjudicated by the Maine
Supreme Court, the court found
“clear and convincing” evidence
of his preference to have tube
feeding stop after he became
comatose from a fall from a pickup
truck. Prior to the accident, he
told his girlfriend that “he would
want to die” rather than be kept
like the residents of a nursing

home where his girlfriend
worked. ~
Gardner made similar

comments to his mother, brother
and a friend before the accident.
The court found Gardner’s
comments sufficient evidence to
construct his preferencelto die
and remove the feeding tube.
On the otherhand, in 12 out of
the 14 cases concerning women,
the courts did not accept the
preferences of the women.

NEVER EVER

Vndor says Campus
Store violating rules

By Renee Crespy
News Editor

Charles Bonasorte, owner ofthe Pittsburgh Stop, plans to take
legal action against Your Campus Store for altering shirts
illegally after receiving them from the printer and the University
of Pittsburgh. 

Bonasorte, who sells Pitt clothing, including Pitt major shirts

and sweatshirts, said Your Campus Store is illegally altering its
major shirt-,s,a~and Pitt refuses to take action.
- »“I get alllmy stuff from a licensed printer, including my major
shirts, for which Pitt receives all royalties. However, I’m not
allowed to print anything else on them that's not already there
or alter them in any way, which I don’t do,” said Bonasorte.

According to Bonasorte, his printer received a letter from Pitt
stating laws about the decals on shirts, particularly those of the
major shirts.

“My printer received a letter from Pitt saying he’s not allowed
to use transfers of decal letters, but you can walk into Your
Campus Store and tell them what major your want, and they’ll
iron it on right there,” said Bonasorte.

Scott Sabol, manager ofYour Campus Store, said Bonasorte’s
accusations are false. '

“I have no idea what Bonasorte is talking about. I guess he
makes things u p. Everything I get is from a licensed printer, and

we don’t even have a printer in the store, [to iron on decalsl,” -

Sabol said. '

The Pitt News attempted to purchase a T -shirt and a major
iron—on at Your Campus Store. The store owner said he would
only iron on a decal after the shirt was purchased and it no

"longer belonged to Your Campus Store. The iron-on is free of

charge‘; ' ' _
According to Bonasorte, he called William Richter, who is in
charge of trademarks and licensing at Pitt.

“"1 called up Bill Richter  and told him about Your Campus

_Store, and he endedup hanging up on me. I told him the issue

here is, I’m giving you reliable information,” said Bonasorte.
Richter said Bonasorte never called him.
“I know nothing about any of this, and I’m not going to
respond to things that he just said,” said Richter. ‘
The university is treating this incident differently than any

I other complaint because of Pitt’s involvement with Your

Campus Store, which. rents from Pitt, according to Bonasorte.

“I feel the university should protect the copyrights for allof
us. If it would have been any other store, I would have
complained just the same,” said Bonasorte. “The university
store is altering their goods right on Pitt’s campus, and they’re
not doing anything to stop it  My argument is that Pitt is closing

their eyes to the whole’ "situation because [Your Campus Store
' is} affiliated with the university,” said Bonasorte.

Judy Frank, assistant general counsel for Pitt, said, “We can't
comment on the situation because the two parties are in

...Aetivist will travel to Iraq for fact-finding mission

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Most people think the war in the Persian
Gulf has been over for months. Not Jill
Castek.

Castek, a Pitt senior and an active
member of Pittsburgh Students for Peace,
left May 31 to participate in a peace walk
in Israel and a fact-finding mission in Iraq.
A Duquesne University film student will
be accompanying Castek and making a
documentary about the effects of the gulf

 war. The two-month trip is being sponsored

by an anonymous donor.

“It’s all of our responsibilities to find out
what’s going on. Jill is our ambassador.
We can’t all go over there,” local activist
Vince Eirene said. _

“I think any human being could survey
the situation and come "back with
something that could motivate us,” Eirene
said.

Along with S0 to 100 other marchers,
Castek will participate in an international

peace walk from Jerusalem to Amman, a
distance of about 50 miles.

She has not been training for the six-day
walk, which is designed to “focus attention
on the gulf war and the situation in the
Middle East,” especially the tensions
between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
Castek said.

After participating in the peace walk,
Castek will travel through Iraq, especially
the northern region, where the Kurdish
refugees are.

Castek will be photographing the after-
effects of the war in Iraq and speaking
with war refugees, and she plans to write
articles and give speeches about her
findings when she returns.

Castek, who is majoring in French and
Italian, plans to use this experience to
teach independent-study courses in the
political science and history departments.
Castek said she does not have departmental
approval for these courses.

She said she will be assisting the Gulf
Peace Team, an international organization

centered around alleviating the tension in
the Middle East, with distributing medical
supplies.

According to Castek, she and her J

traveling companion “haven’t had medical
training and things like that. We’re there to
offer our support.”

“I couldn’t think of a better person to
go,” said Melissa Moran, who withdrew
from Pitt the day the war began. “Jill’s a
very warm, caring person  Her dedication
to the movement was stronger than
anyone’s I know. She’s strong. I guess
that’s her biggest qualification.” -

“A lot of people have given up hope. I
don’t think she has,” said Darren
Hawthorne, a former Pitt student and a
former member of Students for Peace.

The membership in SfP sharply declined
at the end of the spring semester, according
to Dean Gerber, a graduate student in
geology and an active member of Stu dents
for Peace.

Membership “started to drop off right
around the time of finals. Everybody pretty

much gave up their schoolwork for a few 0

months” and had to catch up, Gerber said.

Other SIP members dropped out of the.

organization because they were frustrated.

Martin Sheen joins Zocalfiglot against toxic waste incinerator

By Davi(1.We.lch .
Staff Writer

Actor Martin Sheen was at the
William Pitt.Union to help kick

off a caravan Sundayin protestof .

a toxic—waste incinerator which
is under construction in East
Liverpool, Ohio.

Sheen and the 50 other
protesters started their caravan at
the union and continued to
Beaver, Pa., with another stop in

‘ft Wheeling, W. Va. The caravan

ended at the incinerator, site..

Sheen, an environmental
activist, said, “This is not what I
do for a living; it is what I do to
stay alive.” He also quoted Robert
Kennedy, “Some men see things
as they are and ask ‘Why?’ and
some see things as they could be
and ask, ‘Why not?”’

The'$128 million incinerator is.
being built by Waste Technology

according to Terry Swearingen of
the Tri-State Environmental
Council, “4.7 tons of lead and

1.28 tons of mercury into the air ,
» each year  These emissions can
travel for hundredsof miles.-They I
never break down, and they d__on’t 3

disappear,” said Swearingen.

But WTI spokesman Vicky
Heidel said emissions from the
incinerator are well within the
limits of the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the East
Liverpool incinerator “is one of
the cleanest stacks on the river,”

“The permit process for the
location of the incinerator was 5
and a half years of scrutiny. We
were issued three types of permits.
One was even appealed but still
approved. It seems the experts
find’ the _location safe,” Heidel
said.

Swearingen said the lead and
mercury “can get into the food
chain. If it deposits in the water,

it can contaminate fish. Three-
tenths of a gram of mercury is
enough to contaminate ‘a 25-acre
lake to the degree" that the fish

. will have unacceptable levels of

mercury,” ‘Swearingen said.
Heidel ‘ad'cl<‘e‘d,"“‘We are“ ‘not
stockpiling waste. We are
destroying hazardous waste. We
go where the waste is, the
industrial Northeast.”
Swearingen’s greatest concern
is that WTI’s -parent company,
Von Roll, is not an American

. company. «-~ ~ ..

“It’s a Swiss company’. Theyﬁare
treating us like a Third'World
country,” she said. She said they
are making their profits in America
at the expense of the U.S.

Environmental activist Vince
Eirene said 90 more of these
incinerators are b'eing"built or
planned‘. ” , ' ~

Just ‘before Sheen and the
caravan ‘embarked on their
journey: Sheen said, “We’re all in
this together. It’s a problem in
our culture. No one gets out of
this until we all do.”

The caravan, organized by
Eirene, first went to Beaver where
Jim Skovran, presidentof the

..;Sout_h_west Pennsylvania;Al.liance 1

ivfolr 'a"Clean lEnviron‘m:e.n't, called
for more action from state
politicians to stop the incinerator
from being completed.
The second stop in Wheeling

  
 

‘O.

 It’s a mind-boggling, hair-raising,

\\ atl scratc\\'\t\%»,
e .

included speeches from West
Virginia Attorney General Mario
Palumbo and West Virginia
Governor Gaston Caperton.
Caperton pledged his support: “I”
will stop WTI.”

At the caravan’s final stop in
East Liverpool, it was announced
that an organization representing
all of the physicians in Ohio has
adopted a resolution, based on
their knowledge as physicians, to
oppose the toxic—waste
incinerator.

Stephen King novel? Dante’s.

By Eric Hayes
For The Pill News

You inch through a pitch-black
corridor, touching the wall to
guide you forward. It is so quiet
you can hear yourself breathe.
Suddenly, you step into a
darkened room and freeze. In
front of you is a circle of purple
lights on the floor. Coming from
the ceiling above the circle is a
cloud of vapor. Something moves

, in its center, familiar yet

 

disturbing. It is a giant blinking
‘eye — and it’s looking at you.
Is this a bad dream? The newest

  

Purgatory? Guess again. This

artwork can be found at the Three"

Rivers Arts Festival in Downtown
Pittsburgh through June 16. The
room is one of a two—part
collaborative installation at the
Wood Street subway station.

In addition to outdoor sculpture
and a juried art show, the festival
features local and national
performers, craftspeople
displaying‘ their wares, a film
festival and many food stands.

Musical performances take
place at four areas, including the
Symphony Stage in Point State

Park and the PPG Plaza stage. All
performances are free,ranging
from the rock group America to
Umoja, a group specializing in
traditional African drumming and
dance.

Associated with the arts festival
is the Three Rivers Film Festival,
which highlights American
independent filmmakers. Two
major ﬁlms featured are Superstar;
subtitled “The Life and Times of
Andy Warhol,” and Poison, a film
of interrelated stories inspired by
the work of playwright Jean
Genet.

In Point State Park, a barge

I through

-  THE rpm News; Wednesday, June 5, 1991

moored close to the fountain
features an exhibit about the Ohio
River and its history. Admission is
$1, and the exhibit is open to the
public from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
through June 6.

Also in the park is a walk-
geodesic-dome
sculpture. Doug Hollis’ public
artwork, “Points of View:
Reconsidered Landscape,”
functions as a giant camera
obscura, letting» in light through

pinholes in-‘each of its exterior-

pyramidal points.
The light comes in as upside-
down pictures of the festival

outside, projected onto the inside
of the dome.

An information booth on Liberty
Avenue, next to the Pittsburgh
Hilton, distributes program guides
for the festival. Film festival
information can be obtained by
calling 471-9700.

This year’s festival faced
funding cutbacks because of the
state—budget deficit. Governor
Robert Casey cut all funding to
the Pennsylvania Council on the

Arts‘ summer programs, but the «

festival was able to receive
increased funding from individual
and corporate contributors.

oversights,” said outgoing Pitt
President Wesley Posvar at a

University Senate meeting.

“We were bidding, and the
development corporation outbid
us, and the principal participant
was the hospital,” Posvar said.

Toby Chapman, associate
professor of chemistry at Pitt,
brought the issue to the attention
of the University Senate.

“The university was outbid by
another part of the university for
the space,” said Chapman. “This
space is absolutely critical to the
future of the university.”

Chapman said he was
concerned that Pitt may be unable
to purchase property adjacent to
the existing campus, making it
difficult to expand.

Thomas Anderson, professor
of geology and chairperson of
Pitt’s Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee, which
oversees acquisitions, said he was
unsure of how the medical center

.1‘; ix . ‘_ V‘ ‘ C.

was able to place a bid on thevsite

without the
knowledge.

“Some employees of Pitt had to
know it,” Anderson said.
“Apparently, they were few in
number. It’s unclear to us who
knew and who didn’t know, and
why things were done the way
they were done.” ‘

Wilfred Daehnick, associate
provost for research, said
although several members of the
UPMC board -'1é3‘fi- trustees are
affiliated with Pitt,’ the ‘UPMC is
an independent agency and may
act in its own interests without
consent from the university.
Daehnick said he was unaware
ofthebid on the mosque. He said
no internal memos had been sent.

“I only hear rumors,” said
Daehnick. ‘

university's

“I suspect that the development
corporation has been retained by
the medical center,” Daehnick
said.

Thomas Detre, president of the

UPMC, said during the senate
meeting that the situation was
very complex, and it merited a
thorough investigation.

“I think the current arrangement
still calls‘ for a sharing between
the university and the hospital,
with the Fifth Avenue side being
delegated to the university and
the back side to the hospital,”
Detre said.

“The university can and should
exercise its option to take a good
portion of the new building, so it_
is not lost, ”‘Detre said.

Detre could not be reached for
further comment.

Chapman said he was worried
UPMC’s greater financial
resources would make the
university a “poor cousin” to the
medical center if there were future
conﬂicts over space.

Posvar said a new
subcommittee of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees was formed to prevent
similar misunderstandings in the

Pittl may lose increase...

Yesterday, the House Appropriations committee
chairperson recommended that Penn State, Lincoln ‘and
Temple universities receive 2.5-percent increases in fiscal

‘ year 1992 in their appropriations from the state. However,

Pitt» should not share in the increase, the chairperson

I .., announced.

The decision was made because Pitt officials “lied”

1 7. when they were questioned about President Wesley

Posvar’s retirement fund. _
The chairperson saw the denial of funds as the only way
to end the mismanagement of funds at the University of

ls’ Pittsburgh.

Dennis McManus, Pitt’s lobbyist in Harrisburg, said,
“The message that the House Appropriations Committee

, is trying to send is that they are obviously concerned and

displeased with various reports in the media. They are
particularly upset with the university’s earlier response on
[Posvar’s] retirement package.” ,

Therefore, once Posvar leaves, the university community
will be punished for his actions — actions we could have

, ' . not prevented.

While The Pitt News can understand the-position the
House Appropriations Committee is forced to take, it" is
outrageous that our tuition will probably be raisedito
compensate for the loss in state funding.  I '

The commonwealth should spend more time
concentrating on punishing Posvar and the Board of
Trustees —— and not punish the innocent students, faculty

 and staff at Pitt.

Faculty callsfor audit...

 The Faculty Assembly has demanded an independent
investigation of university spending.

The faculty has rightfully lost confidence in Posvar and
the Board of Trustees, which approved Posvar’s multi-
million dollar retirement package, which is being
‘distributed at a time when faculty salaries are well below
the American Association of Universities mean.

Faculty representatives want the trustees to prevent
Posvar from receiving parts of his already-approved
package — more specifically, his $309,000 annual salary
continuation after he retires.

_ This call for an audit should be taken seriously by the
. university community. .

” As the district attorney’s investigation of the Golden

4 Panthers scandal has shown, sometimes an outside

investigation is the only way the truthabout internal
university corruption can come to light.
‘The university faculty deserves praise for its decision to

A pursue an investigation of Posvar’s lavish retirement

settlement.

Rem‘ controlcaases homelessness

Last year a man, by the name of I
William Tucker, publisheda book
titled T be Exclua’ed.Americans.
This book is about government.
housing policies and how they
relate to the nation’s homeless
population. Most notably, Tucker
shows how government policies
of zoning and rent control have ‘
resulted in homelessness.

Zoning is a policy in which
local governments decide what
can and can’t be constructed on
land, even when the land is
privately owned. Zoning laws set
limits on the number of units of
housing that can be built on any
particular piece of land. Because
of ‘these restrictions on density,
the per unit cost of construction
is much higher. In addition,
because the supply of housing is
less than it otherwise would be,

"the rent will be higher. By limiting

the supply of housing, zoning
causes prices to skyrocket. This
causes homelessness.

Another government policy
that causes homelessness is rent

5 control. This is a policy where the

government sets the rent that a
landlord can charge for his or her
apartment units. _ _ ' .

These "government-set rents
tend to be much less than what
they would be in "a free market.
This causes a shortage of housing,
which results in homelessness; _

Rent‘ ‘control’ "prevents many
landlords from’ getting enough,
money to be able to properly‘
carefor their apartments. Many
landlords cannot afford to pay:
for heat, electricity and other bills,
and endup abandoning their
buildings. For example, in New
-‘York City in 1989, 11,000
apartment units were abandoned
by their landlords.

    

1
Alman

Rent control also discourages
developers from constructing
new housing. When it comes to
preventing development, rent
control is usually’ a much worse
culprit than zoning.

The U.S. cities that have rent
control, such as New York City
and San Francisco, are the same
cities that have the worst problems
of homelessness. Before
instituting rent control, the
problem of homelessness inthese

cities was not very large. It was I
only after rent control came into _

- populations of these cities ‘started

to swell. ‘ ‘ ' i

Actually, I think I am able to

answer that. On the outside, these ‘.
“advocates” state thatthey wish,‘

to help the homeless._ But in
reality, their desire is to increase
governmental power. Most of
these “advocates” are socialists

‘ and other left-wing loonies who

are against anything that even
remotely resembles private
property and capitalism.
Another peculiar thing about
these people is that they claim
that federal funds for housing
were cut during the previous
decade.
But in T ucker’s book, he shows
that this is not true. These
spending “cuts” are merely the

result of some very creative »

bookkeeping.
For example, at one point in

time, certain kinds of spending .

were planned out 15 years in

advance, and the spending for -

the entire 15 years was counted
for just one year. When this was

‘later cut from 15 years to five-

years, the federal government

' was accused of cutting spending.

In reality, federal spending on

housing actually iricreased during ‘

the 1980s. ._  , . .

Shakespeare Festival's Othello highly recommended.

.ever—heightening ' emotion.

By Mindy Boffemmyer
T be Pitt News

The set of Othello for the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival was
designed (by Ellen Seeling) to
reflect the inner workings of
Othello’s mind.

The floor and fixtures were
constructed to represent the breast
plate of a suit of armor with an
enormous crack running through
the center.

Gauzy sheets of black fabric
ornamenting the set serve as

reminders of Othello’s

vulnerability. » 
Seeling’s and Director W.

Stephen ' Coleman’s

conceptualization of this set is a
good illustration of the artistry
inherent in TRSF’s first production
of the season.

Othello is a brave and
accomplishedwarrior who carries

himself with awe-inspiring;

strength and composure at the
start of the play. ‘ ’ "
But, as an African man living
far from home as a leader in a
white European society, Othello
possesses an internal vulnerability

_ that is invisible to some and preyed

upon by others; His love for the
fair, fair, oh so fair Desdemona
enhances his vulnerability to his
eventual downfall.

Nearly everyone ﬁnds fault with
the interracial union, but the
objection of Iago (who is also in
love with Desdemona) turns into
a nasty, sociopathic obsession.

go (one of Othello’s soldiers
who, incidentally, was not
promoted when Othello was)
develops a twisted plot to destroy
Othello by prompting him to first
suspect, then distrust and finally
murder the only love in his life,
Desdemona.

Iago’s plan centers around the
puppeteering of Desdemona and
Cassio, Othello’s soldier and ally.
Through an elaborate series of
deceptions, ‘Iago manages to
convince Othello that the two are
lovers. ..

The ‘same vulnerability which
draws Desdemona"s love to
Othello also attracts Iago’s skillful
manipulation.

On June 26 the National
" Basketball Association will hold

. its annual draft in New York City.

This year’s senior and
undergraduate class‘ is filled with
-big-time talent and expectations,
as well as its annual share of
busts. The Centers are short in
talent. The guards are enigmas,
but the forwards (particularly at

6 the power position) are the best
-of the bunch. Thus, we begin

with this year’s deepest group.

Power Forwards:

1. Larry Johnson (University of
Nevada at Las Vegas, 6-foot—7),
went from JUCO player of the
year to NCAA MVP, incredibly
difficult to defend in the paint
because of strength, quickness,
moves and good eyes. Ferocious
rebounder who plays taller than
his, height. A winner.

2. Doug Smith (University of
Missouri, 6-130), awesome talent
with tremendous athletic skills.
Extremely versatile player who
runs the floor well and can

. dominate inside with refined

moves and power. A big—time
scorer who likes to take over
games, particularly against a
shorter opponent.. Could be
rookie of the year.

3. Brian Williams (University of

Arizona, 6-11), another super‘

athlete who settled in nicely at U
of A after ﬂoating around at
Maryland and three high schools

’ L ‘ in four years. Give him a home,

and the southpaw can be
devastating. Goes to the boards
hard and has learned how to play
defense; can play center and will
be an all-star.iA;r§i years to come.
4. Anthony Avent (Seton Hall
University, 6-10), excellent senior
season has propelled him into
the elite. Not as talented, athletic
or dominating as the top three,

-Kurri adds new s

(Power forwards: bumpe

but he’s developed a soft touch
in the lane and a nice drop step.

Strictly an inside player who can’t  1'

.defend or score outside the foul
line. Might not need to on the
right team. ~

5. Perry Carter (Ohio State
University, 68), another drop here
in talent levﬁe'l'l'5ut‘Vhot in strength.
Big bruiser with body of Hercules
and hands of (Dwight) Stone.
Could be a nice bench rebounder
until his shot improves, if it ever
does

6. Damon Lopez (Fordham
University, 6-9). WHO? Played
center for the Rams but should
play the power slot in pros. An
enigma because of experience
(only four years of hoops) and
quality of competition. Overall
he’s rawerlthan Kibbee. Played
well in the tournament and at
invitationals, and he gets off the
floor quickly. Sleeper.

7. Mark Randall (Kansas
University, 6-9), smart, sound
player who gives it his all and
plays good defense. Offensive
skills are decent, but he was in
the right place at the right time in
college. Said to be interested in
Europe.

8. Brian Shorter (University of
Pittsburgh, 6-6), real strong with
a good touch from 12 feet and in.
Excellent rebounder for his size.
Remember, he was the best player

. in the Big East two years ago but

struggled in his ﬁnal year. Has
looked impressive in postseason
camps and is worth a look.

9. Pete Chilcutt (University of

.North Carolina, 6-9), a hard

worker with a soft touch and
well-tuned passing skills. A typical
UNC power forward, he’s smart,
has talent and didn’t get the
Chance to display it with 12 other
all-Americans around him. But
remember J.R. Reid, Scott
Williams, Joe Wolf. Derek says
he’s notJoe Wolf, and he’s looked
strong in postseason camps.

10. Marcus Kennedy (Eastern

:90

:-

Michigan University, 6-9). He and
Lopez are the slumber crew here.
An excellent scoring touch and
strong moves. Plays good defense
and can rebound. ' Had an
exceptional NCAA tournament.

Small Forwards: _ .

1. Billy Owens (Syracuse
University, 6-8), all-everything
who had nothing more to learn
from Jim Boeheim. Possible No.
1 pick, regardless he’ll be an
impact player. Doesn’t have
Danny Manning’s knees or
excuses so he won’t bust. No
Pepsi, please — this is the real

‘highly touted Anthony iAven't"(3i2).

 

thing.

2. Chris Gatling (Old Dominion
University, 6-9), former Pitt recruit
who enjoyed the southern
hospitality. Mobile and always
active, he’s a true athlete. Not
physical enough for the power
position but crafty enough to
jump over or around a defender.
Outside touch a little
questionable, has improved
drastically with each year. Might
take a few years, but he’ll be a
player.

3. Stacy Augmon (UNLV, 6-7),

awesome_athlete who made the .

defense. Lanky build and long
arms make him an effective
rebounder, and he can really soar.
His shooting has improved from
bad to streaky, but his ball
handlingis the thorn in his side.
Exciting to watch.

 4. Steve"Hood (James Madison
University, 6-7), excellent
offensive player. Can run in the
open court and can fill it up from
1.ong range. Can ‘play some
defense too, but needs to work
harder. , ' _

5. Melvin Cheatum (University
of Alabama, 6-8), another stellar
athlete" and defender who has
improved each season but still
isn’t the superstar he was
projected to be. Jump shot not
too good, but he is a nice prospect.

. 6. .JifI1mY O1.i.ve.r .. (Purdue.
University, 6-6). Derek loves him,
citing his up—tempo style and
smooth touch. Since he comes
from Purdue, Brian figures he’s
overrated but physical.

7. Kevin Brooks (Southwestern
Louisiana University, 6-7). This
guy can fire the rock’ from
anywhere and can penetrate with
his quickness. He comes from
SWLA, so he knows how to play

‘D. Invite him to the slumber

party.

8. Louis Banks (University of
Cincinnati, 6-6), might be better
at off-guard, but can rebound
well, is-creative with the ball and
has a nice shot. Not a,glaring
weakness, but not explosive.

9. Rick Fox (UNC, 6-7), another
UNC star who might blossom
because of his nice outside shot.
Took over some games for the
‘Heels last season but wasn’t real
impressive in the tournament.

10. Reggie Hanson (University
of Kentucky, 6-7), ‘all-around
underrated player who can play
four different positions. Excellent
athletic skills and his versatility
may earn him a job. '

pice to Los Angeles’ hockey quest

Madonna unveiled her new movie last
weekend to her adoring public, but Los

4 Angeles Kings owner Bruce Mc Nall may

have outdone the glam queen by acquiring
former Edmonton Oiler and five-time
Stanley Cup ring holder Jari Kurri.

Kurri, who skipped out to play in Italy
this season, most likely told Edmonton
and/or any other National Hockey League
team interested in his rights that the only
way he would play is if it were with his
silverware-wearing partner Wayne
Gretzky. Thus, Edmonton, Los Angeles
and Philadelphia hooked up on a three~
way deal that has McNall drooling,
Edmonton wondering what happened and
Philadelphia thrilled.

The Flyers realized that Kurri wanted no
part oftheir organization, so they wheeled
him in an exacta with defenseman Jeff
Chychrun and acquired L.A.’s best
defensive players: center Steve Kaspar

and the underrated Steve Duschene. Kaspar
is a tremendous defensive forward who
plans to follow Mario Lemieux around the
ice, while Duschene has been snubbed
from the all—star game for too many years
now. He should inject much-needed
offense on the blueline and gives the
Flyers the quarterback on the power play
they have longed for since Mark Howe
realized his bones were old. Also back in
Flyer black and orange is tough guy Dave
Brown, who hated Edmonton despite being
a member of a Stanley Cup champion.
Goonie Brown thought that Glen Sather
and Co. weren’t giving him enough
minutes. He thinks he can score; they
knew his return address.

Edmonton gets rugged Scott Mellanby,
who has struggled since being taken off
Rick Tocchett’s line two years ago, right-
handed punching (I think he shoots right
also) Craig Berube and little-known Craig
Fisher. Big deal, right? It seems like
Edmonton was sitting in the middle of the
dinner table for this deal and got to take

I

the leftovers home.

As for L.A., you can’t blame McNall. He
has gone way out of his way to acquire
anyone who remotely had anything to do
with the Edmonton dynasty. First, getting
Gretzky and Marty McSor1ey and now the
flying Finn Kurri. For McNall and the
Kings, the ticket is entertainment. Gretzky,
Kurri, Tomas Sandstrom, Luc “I’m no
playoff ﬂuke” Robaitaille and Tony Granato
give L.A. five legitimate 40-goal scorers.
But L.A. also loses two of its finest warriors,
and the most important player on this
team is none of the above, but the one in

front of the net, Kelly Hrudey. Hrudey had .

a great season and an even better playoffs,
but “Los Angels” was knocked out because
of its lack of depth when Sandstrom,
Robert Kudellski, and Mike Donnelly went
down when Oiler defenseman Craig;Muni
decided to stick out his knee not once, not

twice, but thrice, andthe Oilers skated

away Smythe Division champs.
Maybe McNall.ﬁgures that if they meet
again in that situation, that Muni will be a

“kindler, gentler” player because Kurri is
on the ice. More realistically, the Kings
realized that the karma that clicked between
Jarri and Wayne may be alive. .

If only they could get Madonna to sing
the national anthem.

Other NHL notes;

Mike Milbury finally woke up after a
long season of insults, accusations, and
poor decisions, the ex—Boston player has
resigned as head coach of the Bruins.

Milbury has cited boredom as the reason
for his decision to stepdown, actually he's
attempting to stepup and take General
Manager Harry Sinden's job(Sinden is said
to be headed to the top of the N.H.L. rung
as sucessor to President John Ziegler).
Milbury nowrholds the title of assistant
G.M.How Milbury became bored is
fascinating.Heres the man who accused
Bob Johnson of telling his players to take
cheap shots at the Bruins. during the
playoffs and the man whohad the stupidity
and bias to name the undeserving Chris
Nilan to the all—sta-r team." 7 y I

Pitt President—elect John

increase.”

It’s wrong for the committee to
punish the students for the
wrongdoings of the
administration, said Njugi Nginyo,
a Student Government Board
member. ‘‘I don’t think the_
students should be punished for
something the administration
did,” Nginyo said.

Nginyo said he was
disappointed in the
administration’s reaction to the
committee's investigation. “They
obviously knew how much

money Posvar was going to get V
_ [upon retiringl,” Nginyo said. “The

administration should be more
accountable to students ——they’re
a great reason why this university
exists.”

Nginyo said that it is ironic that
Posvar is ending his 24-year term
amid scandal. “its kind of a
warped way to end a great term.
He did a lot for Pitt.”

Pitt receives about $136 million
in state aid each year. Pitt officials
asked for an increase to $159
million for the 1991-92 fiscal year.
