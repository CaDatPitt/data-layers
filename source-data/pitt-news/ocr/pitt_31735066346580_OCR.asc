Student Union Study Break

RAY HUNTER, Clark Schrock,

and Lyle Sherwin take advantage of the recrea-

tion facilities in the basement

by Senator Bob Rowley. The
Omotion was seconded and passed
A by a vote of 7 to 2, despite objec-
tions from Dave Menzer, Refer-
endum Committee chairman. Men-
zer stated that passage of the mo-
tion was unconstitutional.
Menzer pointed out that though
the constitution did not speciﬁcal-
ly give the vote to graduate stu-
dents, it did provide for the elec-
tion of graduate student senators
to Student Government, and it did
give the right to vote to all. full
time University students.
Amendment Cut Short
Later, a quick ‘motion for ad-
journment by Nate Firestone stop-
ped a suggestion by Menzer that
the Constitution be amended to
allow for the omission of all grad-
uate students from voting in the
referendum.
Following the vote for restric-
tion, Menzer presented a short
report in which he stated that
the format for referendum vote
had been changed. In response
to the feeling on the part of
a few senators that the choice
to retain the present Student
Government should be included
on the ballot, the new referen-
dum now contains four choices
instead of the original three.
On the side of the ballot which
asks “Do you wish to change Stu-
dent government?” the student

.To Use Tapes

.The Language Laboratory
will hold open house Satur-
day for approximately _160
college, high school, and ele-
mentary school educators and
administrators. '

Two speakers will be featured:
Dr. Mario Pei of Columbia Uni-
versity, and Dr. Robert Glaser of
the University Psychology De-
partment. Dr. Pei and Dr. Glaser
will speak on the applications of
teaching machines in modern lan-
guages.

In the afternoon, panel discus-
sions will be held on college, high
school, and elementary
levels, and there will be demon-
strations of the lab in French,
Russian, German, and Spanish

The lab was started last fall,
partly as a requirement for re-
ceiving a National Defense Educa:
tion Act grant for teaching Chin-
ese students, using materials
brought from Harvard by two of
the professors; and by teachers
who have been becoming ac-
quainted with its facilities.

It has a repertoire of tapes
and records which can be piped
from the control panel to the
various booths. At present there
are 17 French tapes in the lab,
running an hour each, which
cover the whole first-year
course, as well as tapes in most
of the other major languages,

There are 30 booths serving the
3000 language students —— the de-
partment would like to eventual-
ly have 200 to 300 places.‘ For
class use each booth can be moni-
tored from a single panel and a
microphone is available for teach-
er-student communication. '

Students may buy raw Siinch
tapes on which the master copy

-and individual responses may be

recorded‘ for later listening and
analysis.

Future plans include putting
material from the Aldred Room
on tape. There are also possibili-
ties for a 12 credit course in
Chinese this summer, with stu-
dents spending‘ three hours a
day in the lab.

Each division of the Language
department hopes to obtain a full
set of tapes for teaching and re-
cording purposes as soon as the
lab is in complete working order.
The lab is open from 9 am. to
9 p.m. Monday through Thursday,
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays, and
from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturdays.

the truly “in" professor has the “buddy” look— Ivy suit, crew cut, Lucky Strikes.

Denf.i'.stryIDept. Co-operates With Association

School to Promote Detal Week

The University School of Dent-
istry is cooperating with American
Dental Association. in promoting
National Children's Dental Health
Week.

With the theme, “A smile is to
keep with good dental health,"
this year’s observance, the 14th
annual one, will be held Sunday
through February 10. 0

Special emphasis will be placed
upon early care of -the child's
foundation teeth in order to pro-
mote a lifetime of dental health.

The foundation teeth serve in
speech, growth stimulation of the
face and jaws, apeparance, and

maintenance of sufficient space for

permanent teeth.

Because dentists feel that un-
treated dental decay is the chief
cause of later orthodontic difficul-
ties, such as drifting and inal-
alignment of teeth, they are pri-
marily interested in protecting
foundation teeth.

THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY is co-coperating with the American
Dental Association in National Dental Week. February 4 to 10.
Kate Curtis and Dr. Edward Zinnser are showing‘ Tom Burne the
proper method for caring for his teeth by daily use of the tooth-
brush. ‘

‘ In the past few years, much stress has been laid on
quality education—-the best teachers, the Harvard scholars,
the willing students. But aside from any classroom situa-
tion, there is a whole realm of education awaiting the Pitt
student in practically any‘ field desired if he will just look
around. ,.

The work that has been done at the University in the
area of outside speakers and stimulating programs has far
exceeded any plans or expectations to accommodate such
programs. The need for a larger auditorium isvnot a new
problem, but it is a constant one which recurs‘ intermit-
tently as evidenced by l.ast Thursday’s capacity crowd for
folksinging Odetta. 

C Nevertheless, using such facilities as are available, the
Student Union Board has been able to present Midday Ser-
ies programs featuring such personalities as ‘Robert Penn
Warren, Yfrah Neaman and Ogden Nash.

PM Series has also followed Midday’s lead with such

performances as those by the Pittsburgh Symphony Sym-

phonetta, and folk singer Peggy Seger. For those who enjoy

‘a Friday night ﬁlm break SUB has again obliged the student

with “Great Adventure,” “Seven Deadly Sins,” “The Whit
Sheik,” and “Citizen Kane.” , -
And although it is the center for such stimulation, the
Union is not the only area that has met the needs of the
mind. ‘Wednesday afternoon book reviews are presented

.Weekly in the Fine Books Room of the Book Center —— or

traveling to the seventh floor of the Cathedral, the art en-

thusiast can examine various means of expression in the

collections and exhibits displayed in the Fine.Arts Room.

Yet these are only a few of the experiences available
to the wondering student. The Philosophy of Science Ser-
ies, Freud and Contemporary Culture lecture series, Pub-
lic Health Seminars——-any of the current plays—all are
oﬁered and hopefully will continue toypresent programs
well worth attending for an education that can not even
be thought of in the classroom.

Latin American Investment

   

By Pedro Tullas

Once again, walls in the major Latin American
cities are being smeared with paint, and the now-
familiar sign “Cuba, Si, Yanqui, No” has re-

‘appeared. Small, but noisy groups have invaded

the street shouting the’ familiar slogan, express-
ing their complaints about the
socio-economic situation and de-
nouncing what they think are
the causes of Latin American

Invariably, “Yanqui Imperial-
ism,” whatever this may mean,

but, curiouslypenough, of all the
forms this “imperialism” may
take, private foreign investment
is the least criticized. The reason
may well be that some people of
Latin America, regardless of social sphere, are,be-
coming more aware of the important role that pri-
vate foreign investment plays in the development
of a country. .

The effects and repurcussions of foreign invest-
ment in Latin America have been multiple. True,
some foreign. companies have engaged in question-
able imperialistic practices, as when half of the
territory of Mexico was in the hands of foreign
concerns; but an objective evaluation would show
that the benefits derived from foreign investment
outnumber the disadvantages.

In general, foreign investment, either in the
formof capital or skills and technology, has been
pumping new blood into the ailing economies of
many Latin American countries. It has helped to
create new capital and to accumulate substantial
savings for reinvestment.

Infernal Spending Encouraged

The latter is helped further by legislation forc-
ing foreign companies to reinvest within the coun-
try a part of their proﬁts at reasonable terms. For-
eign investment has also promoted trade and has
accounted, in as great measure, for the integration
of idle natural resources into the general economy.

All this would be enough to command and en-
courage foreign investment, but there is still more
to‘ be considered favorably. Labor has especially
beneﬁted. The Latin Americans employed in for-
eign companies,ialthough a ‘small percentage of
the total labor. force, receive the best salaries ever
paid in Latin America.- . "

Even more important, this beneﬁt is gradually

Fosfers Heavy Dependency , ,

A prime criticism lies in the fact that foreign,
investment is concentrated mainly in the exploita.
tion of natural resources instead of rnanufactur.
ing, and that most Latin American governments "
depend for their funds on the royalties they re-‘
ceive from the sale of these resources, thus re-S’ 
sulting in a too-close dependency on foreign in-.
terests. When the world is off in a particular in-
dustry, government royalties suffer. Cuts in pro-
duction result in a chain reactionof unemploy-
ment, slackening of internal markets, and reces-
sion. j N

To protect, encourage and diversify their new 
industries, Latin American states have resorted’ _ 
to imports control, traiffs, subsidies and the like.
Almost all Latin countries have passed legislation
requiring foreign companies to grant labor special
advantages. .

We see, therefore, that foreign investments have
both good and bad points. When co-operation and
fairness prevail, however, in the negotiation of
contracts and treaties, it can result in a very prof-
itable and rewarding experience, both for the in-
vestor and the recipient country. Those who smear
walls should keep this in mind.

ion, and Turn Toward Peace, is
joining in a mass demonstration
and peace rally in Washington
D . C. on February 15, 16, and 17.

The group, approximately 45 to
50 strong right now, will join with
an estimated 5000 to 10,000 col-
lege and high school students and
teachers in a demand to the Presi-
dent and Congressmen “for an end
to nuclear testing, an end to
fraudulent civil defense, and a be-
ginning of concrete initiative for
peace.”

Howard Harawitz, president of
the Pittsburgh chapter, estimated
that approximately 100 students
from the University,
Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, and
many high schools in the area will
travel to Washington by bus.
Price for the trip will be about
ﬁve dollars per person.

The chapter is also sponsoring
a rally in the Supper Room of the
Student Union, February 14.
There will be folk singing, ﬁlms,
and two speakers.

Speakers will be Lincoln Wolf-
enstein, a professor at Carnegie

"H Goes On..."

THE GENERAL

No one, except maybe Huey “Kingﬁsh” Long, Adolph Eichmann
and Harry Truman, have been called more names than Brian Gen-
eralovich, the large, brawny young man who plays forward for the
University of Pittsburgh basketball team.

Generalovich was heralded as the “Moose” during: his high-
school days at Farrell, for the earth- quaking clashes which resounded
about the neighboring foothills, when he locked horns with opposing
linemen for the Steelers’ football team.

Generalovich was heralded as an All-American scholastic gridder.

“The 6-4, 215-pound lad was just as adept with a roundball in his mas-

sive hands, and the Steelers, sparked by Brian and Duquesne’s human
trampoline, Wee Willie ‘Somerset, copped the state championship
right in Pitt’s Memorial Field
House.

He was right in Pitt's
backyard, but the gate was
still open. Seventy schools
throughout the country played
musical chairs, bidding for
the services of the versatile
giant. Pitt’s Dental School
was the bait, and Generalo-
vich was hooked.

When Panther coach, Bob

Timmons, saw Generalovich in a
ﬂimsy negligee with tight shorts,
‘looking like he belonged on a
piece of monumental sculpture, he
likened him to the strong-boy of
Dogpatch, L’i1 Abner.
’ One of his teammates this
A season on the varsity, taking note
of his bouyant step, christened him “Bluto,” with rerference to the
tattooed, muscle-bound sailor who is always trying to steal Olive Oyl
away from spinach-eating Popeye.

   

Meanwhile, the label- which has caught the fancy of the pub-
lic and the scribes is simply “‘The General." And that he is. No
athlete at Pitt has commanded the respect of his teammates as
Brian” has. since Joe Schmidt captained the Panther gridders
in 1952.

Much to the consternation of Pitt's football fortunes, General has
shunned shoulder pads and a helmet for good. “He would have been
another Mike Ditka," Coach John Michelosen groans. This is not a
quasi-quote attributed to the tight-lipped mentor. lt’s only said be-
cause Br.i.an isn’1 playing now.

But play basi:ct.ball he does. He’s averaging 16 points a game
for the Pitts, and hauling in about 12 rebounds. In his debut for the
varsity he was assigned to Purdue’s All-American‘ Terry, Dischinger.

After the game, Dischinger’s forehead was a mass of welts. and

he said, “He's like a brick wall that smiles at you!”

For a chaser Brian made his second ‘curtain call against Ohio
State. He must have felt like Samson taking hold of two pillars
when he had to cope with the likes of Jerry Lucas and John
Havlicek. He did an admirable job, too, scoring 15 points, block-
ing out Bob Ferguson’s understudies, and grabbing rebounds.

A‘ “He’s a tough boy,” Lucas admitted. “When a fella’s that strong

.he’s going to cause you a lot of trouble.”

“He’s the best sophomore I’ve ever played against under the
boards,” Havlicek exclaimed. “Sometimes I thought I had good posi-
tion on him, and he just soared straight up and took it right off me.”

Pirate shortstop Dick Groat, who was an All-American at Duke
a decade ago, says, “He’s just tremendous. He can shoot, play defense
and dribble with almost anybody. I haven’t seen many players his
size who can do as Vmany things so well. He should be an Al'.l-Ameri-
can before he graduates.”

The General broods when things aren’t going well. “All those
Serbs are temperamental,” says Doc Carlson, the trat-tongued icono-
clast who once coached Pitt teams. “He frets about his shooting. and
says ‘ah, I can’t hit.’ I told him, ‘listen you big oaf, I’ll punch you
smack in that ﬂat nose of yours if you go around talking like that.”

Eighty-one points in the last three games have done the talking.

Wrestlers Invade Ivy League

To Meet Weal: Cornell Team

By BOB SMIZIK
The Panther matme-n invade’ the ranks of the Ivy League
for a match, at Cornell this Saturday in what could be term-
ed the lull before the storm. .
After facing Cornell, a team that should not give them

«too much trouble, the Blue and Gold move into the toughest

part of their schedule. In a period of 15 days, beginning Feb-
ruary 10, they take on Navy,0
Maryland, Lehigh and Penn State.
A factor that should .im'mea-‘
surably aid the Panthers during
the remainder of the campaign
and which has been a big part of
their success thus far has been
the vast improvement in the 157,
177, and 191 pound weight classes.
Infrequent Wins
Just about the only time Pitt
won in these divisions last year
was when either John Zolikoff or
Daryl Kelvington moved up to 157
pounds or when Jim Harrison
moved into the 177 pound class.
The regulars in these classes
were able to score only two
wins. Augie Arrigone won once
at 157 pounds and Paul Wilson
took a victory at 191 pounds.
Things have been different this
year. With .a greatly improved Ar-
rigone at 157 pounds and sopho-
mores Ken Barr and Tom Jef-
fries at 177 and 191 pounds, Coach
Rex Peery can field a lineup with-
out any “sure losses.”
Barr Undefeated
The 7-3-2 record these three.
have compiled is far better than T
was done last year. Barr is unde-
feated while J effries took his first
loss against Northwestern.

along with six other teammates
should not have too much
trouble with Cornell, whose
only advantage ovel the Pan-
thers is that they have won
more meets. The Big Red have
won six of their nine matches
thus far, most of them against
weak competition. ‘
The two attempts to crash the
big time were disastrous. Lehigh
shut them out 33-0 and Penn
State won almost as easily 22-8.

Cats Seek
Number 10

Squads Improved
Since Last Clash
By ART FLEISCIINER

Coach Bob Timmons'
roundballers will make their
try for win number ten this
Saturday night when they
play twice victorious Carne-
gie Tech. The team from
down the street was no match
for the Panthers earlier in the

year, but since then have shown
deﬁnite improvement.

The Cats will have no excuse
for taking this game as a breather.
All they have to do is look at the
score of the Tech-Penn State
game and look at the results of
their own encounter with the
Lions.

In comparing the two schools,
Tech coach Mel Cratsley said,
“Pitt has the better personnel.
They are more aggressive than
State, and aggressive teams give
usmore trouble."

The Tech men have played
since their seven point loss to
Penn State and Cratsley plans to
“limber them up” during the
week. He has stressed that if Tech
hopes to beat Pitt they will have
to eliminate the mistakes that
gave the Cats a few easy hoops
the last time the two teams met.

“Since we played them last,”
Cratsley continued, “they have
progressed very well. Both Brian
Generalovich and Paul Krieger
seem to have made the most gains.

that’s where we are weak.”

The quick-witted coach man-
aged to add some humor when he
responded to the question of the
type of defense that he plans to
use. Quite seriously he comment-
ed, “I wish we could use six
men."

The Panthers did n-ot practice
on Monday, but they will be hard
at work the rest of the week pre-

tory.

 

What's themost convenient
way to bank in Oakland?

Even though Arrigone is 1-2-1
his two losses have come against
probably the two best men the
Panthers have faced this season,
Michigan’s Don Corriere and
Army.’s Mike Natvig.

According to Pecry, “Arrigone
should have had a pin against
Natvlg, or at least three points for
a near fall, but they didn’t give
him anything.”

Spirited Cat ~S([1lﬂ.%llm«t}ll Bow

To Penn In Second Defeat

By FRED MARCUS

After polishing off the first three Penn squash players,
last Saturday at the Field House, Pitt’s racquetman bowed
to the next six to wind up on the short end of a 6-3 loss.

Joe Brown eased by Bill Reynolds, 15-11, 14-15, 15-4 and
15-4. Brown exhausted Reynolds during the ﬁrst game with

corner and reverse shots of different speeds.
The two battled each other shot¢

for shot along the side walls dur-
ing the second game, but Brown,
showing little sign of fatigue,
breezed by Reynolds during the
ends of the third and fourth games.
0’Loughlin Unbeaten
‘Dave O’Loughlin remained un-
beaten by whip-
ping Tom Else- ,
road, 15-5, 15-7, 1
and 15-8.
Ralph Ma-
son gave Pitt
match num-
ber three by
cauti o u s l y
and tactical-
ly defeating
John Kent,
18 - 16, 15 - 5.
and 15-4.
Coach Bill Summers mentioned
that the reason for the high scores
for the Penn players in their first
games with Brown and Mason was
the length of time until the two
Pitt men could pick up the style
of the others’ play.
Strong Fights
A.:t*t.er the first three Panthers,
Paul Patton and Mike Smith put
up very strong fights. The Quak-
ers’ "Ralph West tripped ~Patt.on,
15-9, 15-10, 8-15, 11-15, and.15-10,
and Larry Lazarus edged by
Smith, 15-11, 4-17, 11-15, 15-8,
and 17-14. A
In other matches, Mike Wood
won over Roger Glaser, who
-had a sore leg, 15-12, 15-12, and
17-15; Phil Heide defeated Stan
Ruskin, 15-6, 15-11, and 15-7;
Bob Carlson won over Jules
Zacher, 5-9, 15-6, and 15-10:
and Mike Viener defeated Hal
Wrigley, 15-12, 15-11. and 15-8.
Coach Summers mentioned that
the big factors in the loss to Penn
were that the Quakers “proved
to be a little more experienced"
and that the Panthers could not
match the speed put on the ball
by the huskier Philadelphians.

NYU Saturday;

Record Now 3-],

By LEN BERENFIELD
New Yorkers are always in a
hurry. The group of lads from the
big city coming to town this week-
end will not be exceptions. New
York University’s swimming team
is bound to be in a hurry to reach
the finish line when they meet
the Pitt squad at the Carnegie
Tech pool on Saturday at 2 p.m.
Leading the Manhattan mer-
men will be Don Galuzzi, who
swims the 220 and 440 yard free
style. events as if a subway were
chasing him. Galuzzi poses a se-
rious thrcat to Panther ace Steve
Ganong, who still remains unde
feated in these events. M
Backstroker Rich Meyer, diver
Tom Gustafson, and breaststroke
specialist Joel Bernal are also ex-
pected to cause the Panthers con-
siderable trouble.
Tough Competitors
On the whole, the NYU squad
is expected to be a tough bunch
01! competitors. “They have a]. ays
provided us with good competi-
tion,” says Pitt coach Ben Grady,
“and this year should prove no
different. Based on the boys they
have returning from last year they
should have a very well balanced
team.”
The Pitt team has broken a '
record in each of their. four
meets. Dennis Mcﬂugh set a
new mark in the 200 yard
breast stroke and Ron Levine
cracked the 200 yard butterfly
record against Penn last week.
Ron had set a record in the 200

Grant: Finances
Magic Lantern
liistriietioii

By BARRY GROSS

The English Department has re-
ceived a $22,000 grant from the
Oliice of Education to finance a
summer institute for college En-
glish teachers.

At the institute, 75 English in-
structors will learn how to teach
through Professor Edwin L. Peter-
son’s “magic lantern” technique,
using transparent slides and an
overhead projector.

The “technique involves the use
of the overhead projector which
projects colored drawings, pic-
tures, and 35mm and lantern
slides onto a 10 by 12 foot screen,
to convey the “feel of writing to
thestudents,” Peterson said.

Three Sessions Planned

Three sessions of _25 teachers

each will be held June 11 through

-I; June 22, June 25 through July 6,
and July 9 through July 20. Al-
though invitations will be sent all
over the country, most of the
teachers will probably come from
east of the Mississippi because of
the travel costs involved.

Along with Professor Peterson,
Professor Abe Laufe and English
instructor Ray Cristina will con-
duct the program. The visiting
teachers will be shown freshman
English classes in operation and
will learn how to make the trans-

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
  

 
 

 

few teachers of Advanced Place-
ment high school courses will also
be invited.

According to Professor Peter-
son the freshmen of a class are
conditioned to screen learning.
With the effect of the movies
and TV, it is only necessary
to flash an image on a screen
before them to command their
attention. “The screen has be-
come a social custom,” he said.

‘_‘We cannot ask the students to
do. what we can’t do ourselves,”
continued Peterson. “Neither we
nor the students can possibly re-
vise a sentence without seeing it.”

However, with the ‘lantern’ a
sentence can be projected on the
screen and dificrcnt colored lights
can be used to point out the mis-
takes. In this manner, every stu-
dent in the entire class can beneﬁt
from the corrections.”
