Blackout lifted on
Pitt-Syracuse game

By Pete Fleming
and Vince Carey
The Pitt News

Because of the phenomenal
protest against the Syracuse
game's blackout, the Pitt athletic
department has decided to lift it.

‘ 

I think it's a good
gesture on the adminis-
tration’s part.

—— Paul Evans

”We felt that the best way to
show our positive support in the
students’ interest was to lift the
blackout,” said Larry Eldridge,
the sports information director.

The athletic department
received such an overwhelming
amount of student as well as pub-
lic interest that they felt a re-
evaluation of their decision was
in order. The volume of phone
calls that was received on the
matter was from a cross section

of the Pittsburgh community. Stu-
dents everywhere called in, as
did businessmen and communi-
ty residents.

”The number of businesses and
communities that called in was
really the tip of the iceberg [sic]
in making our decision to lift the
blackout,” said Eldridge.

”I think for this game that it
[blackout cancellation] is a good
idea,” said Pitt basketball head-
coach Paul Evans. ’’I think the
reasons for a blackout are very
justified and good ones. I think
the people we're protecting are
the people who support us.

”I don't think it is something
that should happen every time
[students] complain about it, but
in this instance with both teams
playing as well as they are and-
with the interest we have gotten
and the fans’ support, I think it's
a good gesture on the administra-
tion’s part," Evans added.

”I’m pleased that they [athlet-
ic department] have done it,”
said Pitt Center Charles Smith. ”I
think everybody should be able
to see this game.”

Pitt's Mortar Board
plans community work

By Greg Keklak

Staff Writer

February 15 through 19 is Na-
tional Mortar Board Week, and
Pitt's Mortar Board has planned
community service events to
commemorate the week.

The Mortar Board is an honors
society that stresses both good
grades and community service. In
order to get into the seniors’
honors society, one must have a
3.0 GPA. In addition to having a
good grade—point average, one
must also be willing to serve the
community.

The national organization was
formed in 1918 and was original-
ly the only women's college
honors society at the time. Mor-
tar Board began admitting men in
1975 nationwide, but the majori-
ty of members are female. Ac-
cording to Julie Majernik of the
Mortar Board here, six out of 24
members at Pitt are male.

According to Majernik, Pitt was
one of the first universities to
have a Mortar Board, but interest
in it waned, and the organization
disappeared until it was reor-
ganized six years ago.

”|t’s [big] everywhere except in
southwestern Pennsylvania,” she
said.

Majernik sees the week as a

way to create interest in the or-
ganization. ”Being a part [of the
week] will help us re-establish
that we with to help the commu-
nity,” she said.

The Mortar Board will raffle off
a basketball autographed by the
Pitt basketball team and will dis-
tribute organ-donor cards as a
part of observing National Mor-
tar Board Week.

Majernik also said that the dis-
tribution of organ-donor cards
was originally a Pitt Mortar Board
project before it became a nation-
al campaign. She stated that the
distribution came about from
Pitt's affiliation with Presbyterian
Hospital and was so successful
that other Mortar Boards partic-
ipated.

Previous projects undertaken
by the Mortar Board have includ-
ed tutorial work in East Liberty,
helping with a Halloween party
at the Ronald McDonald House,_
sponsoring an AIDS lecture in
cooperation with the BAS, and
raising money for the Hand in
Hand project, designed to benefit
mentally retarded children.

The Mortar Board also took
part in the observance of the
200th anniversary of the Consti-
tution by planting a Constitution-
al Tree behind Heinz Chapel.

”Starwars” satellite test succeeds

By Howard Benedict
AP Aerospace Writer

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A
6,000-pound research satellite
successfully tracked 15 mock
Soviet nuclear missiles around
the globe Tuesday in a major test
for the ”Star Wars" plan to build
a missile shield in space.

Seven sensors on the satellite
and hundreds at ground stations
gathered data that could help de-
termine whether it is feasible to
build a split—second response sys-
tem in space and whether it
could distinguish a real missile
from a decoy.

”We believe we had a very
successful mission,” said Army
Maj. Andy Green, the program
manager for the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization, told a

news conference today.

”We successfully deployed all
the objects on time, and the ob-
servations all were carried out,”

he said.

We successfully
deployed all the objects

vations all were carried

—— Maj. Andy Green

Green said the mission ended
today, but it will take about 10
days to assemble all the data from
the satellite and ground stations

before the degree of success can
be determined.

The $250 million exercise be-
gan Monday evening with the
launch of a two—stage Delta rock-
et from Cape Canaveral. The en-
tire second stage shot into orbit
more than 250 miles high. With-
in four hours, it had deployed all
14 simulated Soviet rockets and
began the first of 200 tracking
maneuvers like those that would
be needed for an orbiting Star
Wars battle station.

A 15th suborbital target pay-
load was launched by a small
rocket fired from the Pacific Mis-
sile Range at Barking Sands,
Hawaii. Green said this provided
missile plume data that could
help develop instruments for de-
tecting a hostile missile coming
off a launch pad.

Casey unveils $19.9 billion budget; no tax hike .

HARR|SBUR(‘i  Called sensi-
ble and even frugal by others,
(iov. Robert P. Casey proposed
a $19.9 billion budget luesclay
that holds the line on taxes and
calls for more spending on edu-
cation, human services and regu-
lation of insurance and the
environment.

Included in the overall budget
are $10.9 billion in state
revenues, $1.5 billion in gasoline
taxes and highway fees, $4 rni|-
lion in federal funds and $3} bil-
lion from fees and other sources.

Casey outlined his 1988-89
budget, the first fully developed
by his administration, in a
H-minute address to a joint ses-
sion of the legislature. lie was in-
terrupted by applause 26 times
and drew the most response
when he urged the Republican-
controlled Senate to enact his
stalled Economic‘ Development
Partnership.

Proposing a scant 1 percent in-
c rease in overall spending and a
4.1 percent rise in expenditures
from state taxes and fees, Casey
urged prudent investment in
Pennsylvania's future.

”Because we cannot spend
limitlessly, we must invest wise-
ly,” he said, recomniending $f38()
million in new or expanded
programs.

"( )ur comniitment to improv-
ing the lives of everyone in the fa-
mily of Pennsylvania is limited
only l)y our determination never
to reach too far into the family
pocketbook,” the governor
added.

House Democratic‘ Leader
James Manclerino said the gover-
nor has “charted a sensible,
steady course  a masterful job
of stretching state dollars to ad-
dress the issues facing us."

Putting Gov. Casey's
budget in perspective

P. Casey's proposed $19.9 billion
state budget would fund thou-
sands of schools, build hundreds
of miles of roads and pay for
countless other projects.

With such massive amounts of
money distributed to so many
state agencies, the dimensions of

the budget can get lost.

Stacked in $1 bills, the gover-
nor's budget would reach 1,348
miles high. Stretched end-to-end,
the budget would reach
1,937,871 miles‘.

Casey's proposal calls for state
spending of $631 a second,
55 i7,861 a minute and $54.5 mil-
lion a day.

Moving west, nearly 85 stacks
of $100 bills could be placed
next to the 841—foot USX Tower
in Pittsburgh.

Lawmakers could simplify the
budget process by giving each of
the state's 1 1.8 million residents
a check for $1,686.44.

Soviet officials call for INF during TV session

MOSCOW — Soviet television
brought glasnost to the seat of
Soviet power Tuesday when it
broadcast live a session of the
Supreme Soviet with officials urg-
ing ratification of the treaty ban-
ning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.

In an unprecedented move,
state TV ran two hours of the ses-
sion held in the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament.

Speaking under the gold
hammer-and-sickle seal of the
Soviet state, top officials called
for the treaty’s ratification, but
questioned the trustworthiness of
the United States.

Kremlin No. 2 man Yegor K.
Ligachev, Foreign Minister Edu-
ard A. Shervardnadze and
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov
all backed the document in their
speeches to the Foreign Relations
Commission of the Supreme
Soviet.

Yazov promised the public that
no country would ever gain mili-
tary superiority over the Soviet
Union.

"We prepared profoundly and
comprehensively,” he said of the
treaty. ”Each word and each
figure in it were most thoroughly
studied and checked.”

The commission must make a
recommendation to the Presidi-
um, which has the final decision
on ratification. The treaty already
has been approved by the ruling
Communist Party, so its passage
is assured.

There was no indication when
final action would be taken on
the treaty signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in Washington on
Dec. 8.

Shevardnadze praised the
treaty that eliminates from Europe
missiles with a range of 300 to

   

3,000 miles as a ”balance of
security, a balance of interests.”
The Soviet Union also agreed to
remove such missiles from Asia
because the agreement ensures
the United States cannot put such
weapons on that continent, he
said.

The pact "would not have
been possible if the United States
at crucial stages had not dis-
played a sense of realism and a
willingness to find mutually ac-
ceptable solutions," he said.

But he said the American dele-
gation to talks on a 50 percent cut
in long-range missiles ”is yet to
part with remnants of its old po-
sitions."

The foreign minister said he
hoped to get a clearer view of the
U.S. position during the Feb.
21-23 visit of Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to Moscow.

Shevardnadze said an agree-
ment on long-range missiles can
be reached in the next four to five
months. The two sides have said
they hope to sign an accord on
strategic arms at a Moscow sum-
mit in the first half of this year.

Congressional war on
taxes hurts locals

WASHINGTON — Congress’
war on tax cheats is producing
some innocent casualties: state
and local governments that may
be forced to cut services in order
to pay a federal tax on gasoline.

The gas tax will be refunded by
the federal government, but no
one is sure how long that will
take. In the meantime, states, ci-
ties and counties will lose the use
of the tax money.

”We buy about $885,000
worth of gasoline a year, and the
tax on that is about $80,000," ex-
plained Mayor Wayne Corpening
of Winston-Salem, N.C. ”What

we do is pay that $80,000 to the
government and lose interest on
it. We can't spend the money
where it's needed. And the law
creates a lot of paperwork for us
and for the IRS.”

A similar problem faces farm-
ers who use diesel fuel for off-the-
road purposes. Starting April 1,
they will have to pay the
15.1-cent-a-gallon tax on each
purchase and apply for a refund
when they file their income-tax
return each year.

Officials of Dade County, Fla.,
estimate they will have to pay $1
million a year in tax on purchases
of gasoline for county vehicles.

”The bottom line is that there
is a revenue need by the feds,”
said Susan White, legislative
representative of the National As-
sociation of Counties. ”They
want to curb abuse and don't
mind doing it with our money.”

Congress’ solution, written into
a huge 1986 bill that overhauled
the income tax, requires that the
gasoline tax be paid at the time
fuel is sold by refiners to
wholesalers.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 10, I988

Q: Last summer, I was seeing
a college girl, a 21-year-old, and
we seemed to be in love. I know
that I was in love. I thought it was
the same with her. We had ter-
rific sex. Then, when her summer
break ended, she broke off with
me, telling me that she couldn't
handle college and a serious rela-
tionship at the same time. I was
very hurt, but that was her deci-
sion, and I had to live with it.

I decided that she was too
young to have the intensity of
feeling that I had about our affair
(I am 27). About a month later,
she phoned me and told me she
was sorry, that breaking up with
me was the worst mistake she
ever made, that she realized that
she loved me and hoped I would
take her back. I was amazed, and
this news sure made my day,
week, and the rest of the year.
She was home for Christmas and

we had a wonderful time.

Then I saw her on a weekend,
and she informed me that on
spring break, she intended to go
off with a college boy. I blew up,
but she said she had to go off

with him because she had
promised him. Afterwards, she
said she will make it up to me.
This scares me about our whole
future relationship. What should
I do?

A: Write this one off because to
ask you to be alone all through
her spring break, knowing that
she is spending it with another
guy because she promised him,
is outrageous. Nothing good will
come out of a relationship with
a woman who will ask you to do

that. I know you are in love with
her, and I sympathize. Also, she
is probably not a bad person, and
to some extent, she probably
deserves your good opinion -
but you cannot stay in a relation-
ship that does so much damage
to your feelings.

Maybe when she is older, she
will know better than to treat
someone this way, but that is
only a maybe -— much too shaky
a thing to build a future on. Be-
lieve me, there are other women
in the world who will be pleas-
ing to you and who will also be
appreciative of you and wise
enough to treat you well.

Let her know that you are drop
ping out of this relationship be-
cause you feel serious about it
and she doesn't, or doesn't un-

‘ derstand how to treat a serious

her about this —— simply write her
a quiet letter turning her free to
spend spring break and summer
break and all the breaks she
needs to have, with anyone else
she wants to spend them with.
And start looking around for
another woman.

Q: I room with a guy I have
been friends with for some time.
Recently, his girlfriend and I be-
gan having sex. I am in a quan-
dary. I know you will say to
break it off with the girl, but this
is more easily said than done.
She keeps coming on to me, and
I have no girlfriend of my own
now. Besides, what if she really
prefers me and would give him
up? What should I do?

If the two of you go on pulling
the wool over his eyes, that is still
bad for you. You have to wonder

when he is going to wise up, and .

what will happen then.

Move out, and tell her it is

moved out. I would not count on

her boyfriend's roommate? What
she has done to him, she would
probably do to you, too.

To cheat or not to

By Pete Fleming
Staff Writer

Whether it's due to procrastina-
tion, boring professors or just old-
fashioned laziness, most students
have their reasons for cheating.

Cheating at Pitt is a growing
problem, and many feel it is not
given enough attention.

”I never even studied for my
psychology final,” said one stu-
dent who wished not to be iden-
tified. ”I made sure I had one of
the smartest people in front of me
and the same on both sides of
me."

”It is so easy to cheat. The

 

~.

professor sat up in the front of the
auditorium and read a
newspaper. Practically everyone
in the place was looking through
their notebooks,” said another
student about her economics
midterm.

Most students feel it is very
easy to cheat within the univer-
sity and are confident that profes-
sors are not able to observe
everyone during an exam.

”Cheating is something that
will always be around. I did some
cheating when I was an under-
graduate, and I never got caught.
In the classes where I cheated, it
was pretty much impossible to

catch anyone cheating,” said a
graduate student.
According to Pitt policy, if a
student is caught cheating, the
professor has the authority to de-
cide what charges will be filed
against the student. The unofficial
mandatory rule is that the student
receives an automatic failure. If
charges are made against the stu-
dent, he or she must appear be-
fore the Academic Integrity
Board, which is made up of
faculty and student members af-

’ filiated with the SGB.

The board evaluates charges
made by the accusing professor
and conducts a hearing on those

charges for the student. The
punishments given by the board
can range anywhere from a warn-
ing to dismissal from the
university.

Dr. Reid Reading, a former
member of the Academic Integri-
ty Board said that most cases of
cheating which came to the atten-
tion of the board were plagiarism.

”Unfortunate|y, plagiarism is
very common here at the univer-
sity. At times, it can be very hard
to pinpoint. Examples can be a
student not citing a reference
properly or even two students
with the same paper but different
wording,” said Reading.

cheat — is it a question anymore?

Students have various methods
of cheating. Previous board cases
include one student who once
copied down exam information
on a small piece of paper while
using a magnifying glass and af-
terwards, made copies of the
cheat sheets and sold them to
other students in the class with
plastic magnifying glasses.

Another incident involved a
student who had someone make
a fake university ID so he could
take the test for someone else.

Cheating at the University of
Pittsburgh does run rampant, but
large-scale cheating still seems to
be under control.

Noriega accused of drug trafficking

By Lawrence L. Knutson
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) ~— A
former associate portrayed
Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega on Tuesday as
the driving force behind a ”gigan—
tic machine” that generated
hundreds of millions of dollars
through drug trafficking, money

laundering, gun running and
other criminal enterprises.

Jose I. Blandon, a former
Panamanian intelligence official
fired by General Noriega as his
country’s counsel general in New
York, said also Cuban President
Fidel Castro once personally in-
tervened in a dispute between
Noriega and the Medellin drug
cartel in Colombia.

his dreams, an 11 out of a
possible 10 (the sensational
Bo Derek)! Moore pursues his
ideal, determined to overcome
all obstacles to win her.
Finally, he succeeds, with
unpredictable results.

“A brilliant and ultimately
poignant farce."

“Dudley Moore brings his
character such life and
dimension that ‘10' is a lot more
than a comedy. its a study in
the follies of human nature."

—Andrew Sarris
Village Voice

—Rogar Ebert

 

One cocaine shipment by an
alleged Noriega associate in-
volved an apparent connection to

‘the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in

Nicaragua, Blandon told a Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee.

Blandon also testified that
Noriega, Panama's military chief,
worked closely with the CIA and
regularly received classified
reports on the political leanings
and personal lives of U.S. sena-
tors and congressional staff
members.

The CIA reports, along with
others prepared by the National
Security Council staff, included
information on the activities of
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a lead-
ing Noriega critic, and on Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D—Mass.,
Blandon said.

Sen. John Kerry,’ D-Mass.,
heading the congressional inves-
tigation, said such reports would
be ”reprehensible” and that if the
testimony proves correct, those
responsible should be fired.

Efforts to reach CIA officials for
comment were not immediately
successful.

Kerry said key U.S. agencies,
including the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the State
Department were until recently
either ”duped” by Noriega or
blinded to the nature of his enter-
prises by their interest in Pana-
ma’s strategic importance as the
site of the Panama Canal.

Using a set of charts, Blandon
described a network of people
and allegedly used by Noriega to
profit from drug-running and
money-laundering operations.

He estimated the Panamanian
leader’s fortune at least $200 mil-
lion but said there are some esti-
mates pegging it closer to $1
billion.

The much-publicized blackout of tonight's Pitt—Syracuse game
has been lifted. That was the decision handed down from the
high ”court” judges in the Pitt athletic department offices yester-
day afternoon.

Many were surprised at the decision, as were we, especially
considering Pitt athletic director Dr. Edward E. Bozik’s initial-
ly firm stand on the issue.

Students and other fans banded together in an effort to put
pressure on the athletic department, and it finally forced Pitt
to re-evaluate its decision. Despite Bozik’s former position on
the matter, and the fact that he made such a last-minute deci-
sion, we commend Bozik for reversing his original decision.

The matchup between Pitt and Syracuse is bound to be the
best in collegiate basketball this season. In fact, Pitt's ticket
department admitted it could have sold nearly 40,000 tickets
for tonight's game. Taking that into consideration, Bozik’s con-
cerns of decreasing the market value of the Pitt basketball tick-
et are unsound. Lifting the blackout was a no-lose situation.
From our viewpoint, the fans who bought tickets are not af-
fected one way or the other if the game is blacked out. They
purchased tickets because they like to experience the live ex-
citement of a basketball game. They do not begrudge others
who want to view the game on television. And those who
couldn't purchase tickets no longer have anything to complain
about — at least until the next home game on ESPN.

In a nutshell 

By definition, a writer cannot serve today those
who make history. He must serve those who are
subject to it.

Who now takes the blame?

At the end of the Second World
War, everyone on the face of the
Earth was overjoyed with the fact
that the most evil and corrupt re-
gime ever to exist had been
defeated. When the Nuremburg
war crimes trials convened, no
one seemed upset with the fact
that no longer was everything fair
in love and war.

Only the Germans responsible
for those actions were upset by
the fact that they were being held
accountable for the slaughter of
Jews in concentration camps and
the many deaths of civilians in
the occupied countries. Even to
this day, the world, led by Israel,
takes great relish in tracking
down the occasional Auschwitz
guard turned auto-manufacturer
or the German army liaison
officer turned state president.

Doubtless you've heard the ar-
guments of German apologists
who claimed that they were only
following orders and state policy.
It wasn't their fault, they said, that
they had to shoot 32 hostages —
they had orders to do it (and be-
sides, they had to do something

to scare the partisans from con-
tinuing their guerilla activities).

These same arguments will
doubtless arise again should ls-
rael ever be ”liberated” by the
Palestinians and other Arab coun-
tries in the region. Imagine the
chagrin on the faces of the once-
proud soldiers of the Israel
Defense Force when they find
themselves on the stand facing
charges of executing Palestinian
civilians. It wasn't their fault they
were issued orders to beat up any
Arab shopkeepers who decided
to close their stores down in pro-
test of Israeli occupation.

The severe Israeli reprisals
against Palestinians in the oc-
cupied territories are geared
toward coercing the populace
into peace. But then, so were the
executions of Yugoslavian
citizens by the Germans and
ltalians during World War II. The

Israelis don't have a special
license to enforce their will
through harsh or unjust means,
and neither did the Germans. The
Germans found out the hard way
what the price was for their
methods of ”peace en-
forcement.”

The United States, which pours
billions of dollars into the-Israeli
economy, has a clear-cut respon-
sibilty of calming the Israelis
down and bringing them to their
senses. No nation on Earth
should allow the Israelis to get
away with a policy of beating
Palestinians to keep the peace.
Whatever arguments the United
States is using to justify its non-
intervention in this matter are not
valid enough to overlook the fact
that an extremely inhumane poli-
cy is being conducted by a coun-
try we are closely tied to — and
if Israel is held responsible, you
can be sure the United States will
be blamed for either aiding Israel
or allowing it to follow this stupid
policy.

THE PITT NEWS

By Kirk Swauger
For The Pitt News

They have cruised to the Big
East Conference Swimming and

; Diving Championships in each of

the past five years. Total domina-
tion is a rarity in today's college
athletics, but the Pitt men's swim-
ming team has controlled the
conference like no other in the
Big East's seven-year history.
That could all change.

First-year swim coach Dick
Bradshaw has been at enough of
the championships as meet direc-
tor to gain a keen understanding
of Pitt's complete rule. He be-
lieves, too, that the competition
will be closer at this season's Big
East championships, Feb. 12
through 14 at Trees Pool.

”Villanova, on paper, looks
better than we do,” Bradshaw
said. ”This will be the first time
our team's been challenged to

Panthers prepare for
Big East clash with
Orangemen at Arena

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Some walk down the road with
the sign that reads, ”The biggest
Big East game of the year.”

Others follow the sign, ”Just
another middle-of—the-season
game.”

No matter which road you trav-
el, Wednesday night’s matchup
between the Pitt Panthers (ranked
No. S by The Associated Press)
and the Syracuse‘ Orangemen
(No. 11 by AP) should prove ex-
citing.

Syracuse seems to be picking
up the pace after a slow start. Suc-
cessive national TV victories
against Michigan and St. John's
have shown that the Orangemen
aren’t ready to roll over.

”They’re [Syracuse] playing the
best ball that they have played all
season,” Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said. ”They are very talent-
ed. We have to slow the game
down just a little bit.”

This game sports a lot of mini-
matchups. One of the most im-
portant will be at point guard.

Syracuse’s Sherman Douglas is
considered by many to be the
premier point guard in the coun-
try. Douglas leads the Orange-
men in scoring by putting in 16.6
points per game. As he goes, the
Orange go.

On the other side of the court,
freshman sensation Sean Miller
will control the Panther offense.
After a bit of a mid—season slump,
Miller is back on track. He is
dumping in 9.4 points per game,
and shooting at a 46 percent clip

from beyond the 3-point line.

”A key to the game is stopping
Douglas from penetrating,” Evans
said. ”He may be the best point
guard in the country, so we'll
have to stop him.

”Sean has been bothered by a
little bit of a thigh bruise, but I
don't think it is that serious. If it
is bad enough to keep him out of
the lineup, I'll have to pray for
snow.”

The one everybody will be
watching, though, will be the
clash in the middle.

Pitt's Charles Smith has been
dominating games of late, and is
having what is shaping up to be
his best season. Smith leads the
Panthers in scoring (17.5 points
a game) and field goal percentage
(58 percent). He is second on the
team behind Jerome Lane with
7.7 boards a game.

On the other bench is Greece’s
favorite son, Rony Seikaly. After
a lot of early season hype, Seika-
ly has settled into a groove. He
is second on the team in scoring
(16.4 ppg.), rebounding (9.8 per
game) and field goal percentage
(58 percent).

”We have to move the ball
around and hit the passes on
offense," Smith said. ”We have
to make them play D a little bit."

”Seil<aly has been playing very
good of late,” Evans said. ’’If he
is on the top of his game, it could
be a long night."

If this game were put into book
form, it could be subtitled, ”The
Battle of the Magical Re-

bounders.”
Please see Pitt, page 13

win. In previous years, we were
always the odds-on favorites.”

Villanova lost little from last
year, when it finished second to
Pitt, 865.5-603. Syracuse was
third with 426 points.

The key to these meets, of
course, is depth. You cannot have
only one or two exceptionally
talented athletes. You need a
solid, well-rounded team filled
with versatile athletes.

Pitt and Villanova both possess

Wednesday, February l0, l988

Men's swim team set for Big East tourney

the necessities to win the confer-
ence championship.

The Big East meet has im-
proved dramatically, to the point
where last year, it had its first
men's NCAA qualifier. Jim Emore
of Pitt qualified in the 100-yard
butterfly, and he will return to de-
fend his title.

Other individual champions
back for Pitt are: John Starkey
(1-meter diving); Tim Adams
(100—yard backstroke); Charlie

Fry (1650-yard freestyle); Mark
Dombrowski (100-yard breast-
stroke); and Scott Jeffries
(100-yard freestyle).

Pitt senior Chris Blair is one of
the premier divers in the Big East,
and Charles Lersch is capable of
winning anything from the
200-yard freestyle to the
1650-yard freestyle.

Bradshaw is excited.
He is anticipating the challenge.

Lady swimmers try to keep championship

By Kirk Swauger

For The Pitt News

The problem inherent with rou-
tinely winning the Big East Con-
ference Women's Swimming and
Diving every year since 1983 is
motivation.

It was easy to prepare for the
first one, or even the second, but
constant success soon becomes
expected success.

Head coach David Belowich -
and, in turn, his perennially
talented women's swim team at
Pitt — has to discern a different
motivational means each year to
keep the desire alive.

The Pitt swimmers have relied
upon revenge, upon reaching

1,000 points and personal pride.
All of these methods have been
successful —- never losing a Big
East Women's Championship at-
tests to that.

There was a team meeting held
at the end oflanuary, in an effort
to prepare for the Big East Cham-
pionships, Feb. 12 through 14, at
Trees Hall. Belowich was not in-
vited: swimmers only. But he
does have an idea of what was
discussed.

”They talked to each other
about individual goals,” said Be-
lowich. ”The program itself is
very goal-oriented. For some peo-
ple, it’s going to the NCAAS. For
some people, it’s winning the Big
East. For some people, it’s doing

the best that they've ever done.

”lnstead of merely performing
for mom, dad, coach and the
team, they're performing for
mom, dad, coach, Judy, Marian,
Celeste. The whole of the team
becomes an entity. What is im-
portant to the individual is impor-
tant to the team.”

Therein lies Pitt's thinking, en-
tering the championships.

It is not a given that, once
again, Pitt will simply dive, get
wet and win. Belowich was re-
cently looking over his roster and
noticed that nine swimmers from
last year's team did not return.
That accounts for nearly 300 of
Pitt's 900 points.

Tricia Riclrert (200- and

500-yard freestyle), Sandy Al-
bright (100—yard backstroke),
Laure Walczak (100-yard butter-
fly), Judy Haughton (200-yard
butterfly) and Margie Paulick (1-
and 3-meter diving), are expect-
ed to once again do well.

They were all Big East winners
last year.

”They're all expected to main-
tain their tradition of excellence
by performing well in the events
they won last year.

Seniors Cindy Rose (freestyle)
and Marian Cassidy (backstroke,
individual) and freshman There-
sa Picklos (mile and 500-yard
freestyle), Celeste Makiel
(200-yard freestyle, 200-yard in-
dividual medley), Kara Moxie

(butterfly) and Liz Sari (distance
freestyle) should also significant-
ly contribute.

’’Filling the void of those who
left are the freshmen and a few
others on the team," Belowich
said.

Villanova should provide the
sternest competition. The Wild-
cats finished third a year ago,
three points behind second-place
Boston College.

”There’s no question Villano-
va is a much-improved team from
last year,” Belowich said. ”They
have a new coach, a new attitude
and a new work ethic. And they
didn't lose a person.”

U.S. athletes welcomed at Olympic Village ,

By John Nelson
AP Sports Writer

CALGARY, Alberta —- World
records will fall during the Winter
Olympics, U.S. speed skaters
predict. And Americans Bonnie
Blair and Dan Jansen could be
among those who break them.

With arctic-like cold gripping
the Olympic town of Calgary,
athletes continued to arrive for
the Games, which start Saturday.
The U.S. slalom, cross—country

and biathlon teams were among
those getting into town.

Although many American ath-
letes still have not arrived in Cal-
gary, the U.S. flag was officially
flown over the Olympic Village
Tuesday in a welcoming
ceremony.

”This is the fastest track in the
world,” said Blair, a former world
record—holder at 500 meters and
considered a top medal prospect
at the sprint distances. "I think
pretty much every world record

will be broken once the races
begin.”

Not only is the ice in excellent
shape at the University of Calgary
oval, but because it is indoors,
the skaters will not have to con-
tend with wind. This is the first
time speed skating will be held
indoors at an Olympics.

”If everybody skates real good,
I think they can all be broken,"
said Jansen, who won three of
four races and the overall title at
the World Sprint Speed Skating

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February l0, I988

Championships last weekend at
West Allis, Wis.

Blair won one 500-meter race
head—to—head with Christa
Rothenburger of East Germany at
West Allis, but Rothenburger
won the overall title.

Olympic officials from North
Korea also were in town, and
they said they would not let their
love of the Olympics prevent
them from using the Games as a
tool to help reunite the two
Koreas.

In an exclusive interview with
The Associated Press, Chang
Ung, secretary graeral of the
North Korea Olympic Commit-
tee, said: ”We love the Olym-
pics. But first, we have to
consider our nation's fate.  It is
a sign of the unity of Korea.”

North Korea is boycotting the
Summer Games because of the
refusal of South Korea and the

IOC to allow Pyongyang to be a
co-host with Seoul.

The International Olympic
Committee, meanwhile, voted
during the first day of its threeday
session to delete a rule from its
charter that it considered sexist.
IOC members struck from its
charter Rule 28, which made par-
ticipation by women athletes
conditional on approval by the

IOC or international sports feder- '

ations.

IOC spokesperson Michele
Verdier said the rule was voted
out ”because it was felt to be dis-
criminatory to women and no
longer applies to the present
world.”

About half of the 1,600 athletes
registered for the Games have ar-
rived, organizers said. They in-
clude one American competitor
who has set off a small con-

No. 1 Temple gets readyfor inner-city rival

By Lee Linder

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Temple
Coach John Chaney says intracity
rival Villanova is a tough oppo-
nent under any circumstance.
Now, there is an added reason.

When they play Wednesday
night, Temple will be the nation's
No. 1 college basketball team for
tﬂ first time in its history.

The 16-6 Villanova Wildcats
are ranked 20th.

Chaney, whose team is 18-1,
expects a ”very, very tough"
contest.

His philosophy is to forget the
pressure and ignore the fanfare
generated by the polls.

”We have been in and out of
a pressure tank all year long,”
Chaney said after the 5:30 a.m.
to 8 a.m. practice session that
concentrated on shooting and
Qfense. ”We have been criti-
cized over the years about teams
we beat and teams we didn't, and
we just won't discuss it.

”We have the right attitude.
We practice hard, and we play
our game. Villanova will be a

very, very tough basketball game.
They are always tough. They
have some great players and both
teams always give 100 percent.

’’It is very rarely a one-sided
contest. We played them twice
last year, and one game went into
overtime. I don't expect anything
different this time.”

Villanova coach Rollie Mas-
simino, whose team was the
NCAA champion in 1985, agreed
with Chaney.

”I think it will be close. We are
not going to Temple to shoot and
play marbles,” Massimino said.

Massimino said he is happy for
the exposure the contest will

. provide.

‘'1 think Temple is outstanding
and we're happy to have the op-
portunity to meet them at this
time. We're playing the No. 1
team and we're not even close,
but we will compete,” Massimi-
no said.

Chaney was asked if his play-
ers had any reaction to the No.
1 ranking.

"1 don't go around asking them
about their feelings, and we don't
talk about the polls, ever,”

Chaney said. ”We just don't let
the rankings influence us at all.

”Being first when the season is
over is really what counts. The
only thing that being No. 1 does
at this time is put more pressure
on me.

”Of course, the players know,
but we never discuss it. The play-
ers are kept away from the media.
Sure, they are human and they
have pressures, but it's my job to
handle the questions.”

Although Chaney claims he
doesn’t believe his team is better
than anybody else in the top 35,
he acknowledges a lot of pride by
becoming the first Temple team
ever to be ranked No. 1.

’’Certainly it means a lot to

Temple University,” he said. ’’I ‘

know it means a lot to Temple
alumni, and I know it means a lot
to the fans. And without question,
I know it means a lot to the play-
ers and people out there who are
interested in Temple.

’’I understand that. But for me,
personally, I have to make sure

I don't get caught up in the fren— I

zy of this thing because my over-

all concern is to make sure that I

we do not lose sight of what
we're trying to accomplish.

”More than anything, it was ac-
complished because of five
seniors — Tim Perry, Howard
Evans, Ramon Rivas, Derrick
Brantly and Jerome Dowdell.
They are the ones who got us
started and helped bring us to
where we are now."

 

Chaney is a strict taskmaster.
Every.Monday through Friday the
players assemble in the McGoni-
gle Hall gym at 5.30 a.m. and
practice until 8 a.m. — on Satu-
days and Sundays it's from 9 a.m.
to noon — and then on to tutor-
ing, classes, homework and
library before bed around 10
p.m.

troversy — football player-turned-
bobsledder, Willie Gault.

Gault, a wide receiver for the
Chicago Bears, was named to the
alternate U.S. sled, bumping Don
Lavigne, who postponed his
senior year at Harvard to try out
for the team. Now, Lavigne says
he was beaten out by the name,
not the man.

’’I feel cheated,” Lavigne told
the Albany, N.Y., Times Union.
’’l have taken the risks and made
the sacrifices and commitments,
and presumably had qualified.”

Lavigne’s lawyer, Alan Rose,
said Lavigne was told ”virtual|y
at the last minute” that he was off
the team. Rose, who filed an ap-
peal with the U.S. Olympic Com-
mittee over the weekend, said
C-ault "just seemed to show up
uninvited in January and was
selected for the team.”

Pittsburgh to host

1990 AII-Star

ST. LOUIS (AP) — The NHL
doesn't have any immediate
plans for expansion, according
to Commissioner John Ziegler.

Holding a news conference
in the midst of the 39th NHL
All—Star Game, Ziegler said
Tuesday that expansion could
not be considered until the 21
teams in the league hammered
out their member-club agree-
ment on television sharing.

That contract expires next
yeah

”|t’s board policy not to con-
sider expansion until that con-
tract is in place," Ziegler said.
”Our No. 1 priority is to put
together a member club agree-
ment for TV. We're working
on it daily.”

Ziegler said the new con-
tract could be completed
soon, though.

In other business, Ziegler
announced that the 1990 All-
Star Game has been awarded
to Pittsburgh, and that the
league had approved the trans-
fer of the Los Angeles Kings’
franchise from Jerry Buss to
Bruce McNal|.

Pittsburgh hasn't hosted the
game since joiningthe NHL in
1967 and 1990 will mark the
30th anniversary of the down-
town Civic Arena.

Extensive Civic Arena reno-
vations that will include new
locker rooms, a larger press
box and a new Igloo Club for
season—ticket holders will be
completed by then.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February TO, T988

Panthers continue to
land talented recruits

(AP) — The University of Pitts-
burgh, which earlier recruited
star linebacker Curtis Bray, has
gotten a verbal commitment from
consensus All-American line-
backer Mike Chalenski of Kenil-
worth, NJ.

The 6—foot-5, 242-pound
Chalenski made the Parade and
USA Today All-American teams
and was called the best player in
the Northeast by one recruiting
service.

Bray, from Gateway High
School in suburban Pittsburgh,
and Chalenski were two of the
three linebackers on the USA To-
day All-American team.

’’I chose Pitt because I liked the
coaching staff, and I liked the at-
mosphere,” Chalenski said.
”They have the right defensive

scheme to suit me. It's similar to
what I played in high school.”

Chalenski, who made 106
tackles and had four interceptions
last season, visited Pitt, Miami,
UCLA and South Carolina. He
narrowed his choices to national
champion Miami and Pitt, which
was 8-4 last season. = ;‘

Chalenski also rushed for 3,84
yards as a fullback — including
1,000 yards as freshman —— at
David Brearley High, the alma
mater of Pitt defensive lineman
Tony Siragusa and center Ed
Miller.

"I think there is an opportuni-
ty for me to start [at Pitt] as a fresh-
man,” Chalenski said. ’’I’d like to
leave the school as an All-
American.”

Pitt also has received commit-
ments from defensive back,
Clifford Moncrief (6-2, 195) and
wide receiver Chris Bouyer (6-3,
180), from Detroit's Chadsey
High School. Moncrief also was
Chadsey’s starting quarterback.
Bouyer caught 36 passes for 715
yards and six touchdowns.

Pitt has received commitments
from 24 players who can official-
ly sign letters of intent on Wed-
nesday.

Continued from page 9

‘Pitt's Lane leads the Big East in
rebounding with 12.6 boards per
game. But Orangeman Derrick
Coleman is hot on Lane's socks
with an average of 1 1 each game.
It's just as close in the scoring
department. Coleman throws in
14.5 points, while Lane contrib-
utes 13.6 each contest.
”CoIeman has really picked up

late|y,” Evans said. ”He couldn't
hit a foul shot early in the season,
but in the last couple of weeks he
has put in 18 in a row.”

If there is one thing that could
be bigger than all of the rest, it
may be the play of the benches.

On paper, the Panthers have
the stronger of the two. Coach
Evans has been able to rely on the
play of Bobby Martin (7.4 points

Freshman Sean Miller and the Panther guards will be tested against Syracuse. A

and 3.9 rebounds per game),
Darelle Porter (4.0 points) and
transfer Nate Bailey to give qual-
ity time on the court.

Syracuse has been using basi-
cally two players, sophomore Earl
Duncan (6.8 points) and senior
Derek Brower (3.6 and 2.9).

”We really need the bench to
play well,” Evans said. ”Our
team isn't the type where we rely

  
    
 
  

 

I3

 

on one player. You can't say that
if Charlie Smith has a great game
we're going win. We need a great
game from all five starters and the
bench/’

”This being my first year and
everything, I've only seen Syra-
cuse play on TV,” Martin said.
”But from what the older guys

have been saying, we're going to
have to go in there and play at
our best. Us freshmen have to go
in and help as much as possible
at our positions.”

In a last minute decision, the
blackout will be lifted and the
game will be televised locally on
ESPN at 7:30 p.m.
