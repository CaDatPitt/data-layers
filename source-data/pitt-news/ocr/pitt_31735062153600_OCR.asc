Dr. H. A. LaidlerI,CSecretary of the
IntercollegiateSocialist Society,‘ ad-
dressed the local ‘branch, Monday on
“-Christianity and Socialism.” The
meeting was attended by a large
number of students. S 3

Dr. Laifdler said the two move-
ments, Christianity and Socialism,
are similar in some respects though-
differentiri others. ‘They are sism-ilar
in their sc.ope and both appeal to the
humbler -classes; both are opposed
and misrepresented, and both are
revolutionary. , He said in part:

“While it is not necessary to be a
-Christian in order to be a Socialist,
yet the principles or - Christianity, if

put in.to practice, would lead to a: co-

operative society and universal broth-
erhood. The ISoLci-alist movement is
the one that will most effectively ac-

. complish these ends. If the people of
Europe had harkened to the Socialist.

movement ‘of the last twenty years,
the war would have probably been
averted. ‘ L ‘L I
Socialism, is not anarchistic, or
bureaucratic. -The movement I does

not aim at a complete state ownership if

of all industries with the suppression
of the individual, but rather, Socialism
aims, to give to the individual every
opportunity for free development and
all the private property that she may
use without giving him power over
other inIdividuals.”

After citing‘ some examples of the
lack of feeling of brotherhood among
men, Dr. Laidler closed with an appeal
for a greater study of Socialism, by
all who entertained any esthetic or al-
truistic ideals.

being dainty hand painted cups and
saucers which “stood alone” and-
tucked in the cup, just ‘ like Jack

drew handsome lovers, others great

lightly tripping to gay music furnished
by the Sepp Orchestra in a hall deco-
rated in keeping with the occasion the
FirstkAnnual Dance -of the Beaver
County Pitt Club, held last evening
at the Junction Park Pavillion, New

Fllli [WAL SATURIIAY

,Having passed through} the gruelling

work necessary to the preparation for :
the Penn Relays, the tracli men now 6
face the proposition -of the hard work
that will precede the meet with Syra-

cuse. Thes.m.eet will be-in the nature
or a. return affair as arranged-by the

dual meet agreement-underz which the

‘Pitt team made the trip tc? Syracuse
last spring. , p 2 i O’   it
The comparison of the strength of
the two teams is a bit more favorable
than it was last season. Last‘ year

the Pitt men were downed by ,,the
oorushing. count o£f83+—42. In the” in-

door clash of thnis winter the Salt City.
men were also thevictorseby a score
of ltsometlhing like the one side-d;propor-

tions or*s3-,-19. The team‘ this year/4

will be crippied by; the loss of ‘Mo.-

Mast,er‘but he. will be ably substituted-

Qior by Hugus and Easterday. l Burwell
and Deilart should give Pitta good
bid for the a short , distances while

Grumbling, Albrighti and Livermore
.should‘pu'sh the visitors hard for the

distance places. The weakest point-
in- the Pittdefelﬁce will be in the hur-

. idles, where Coach 3 Kerr‘ is doing his

best to develop a man from the ‘nu-

merous candidates of the ability of
Hastings, Mcclarens and McNulty. The.

department where Pitt stands the best
chance is in the ﬁeld events. a Last

year Sutherland bested.White in the

discus while Fry took the same man
over in the shot put. 7 ' ‘ » 6
Despite . the apparent ‘handicap,
against which the Pitt men will . be
struggling there will be no discount-
ing of the spirit of the Blue‘ and Goid
men upon the entry into therace and
there will be‘ a pronounced attempt,
not only ‘to wipe out past track de-
feats but also to acquire revenge for
the disregard ‘of. the Syracuse base-
ball men for the feelings of our own
-diamondeers. ‘ - »
