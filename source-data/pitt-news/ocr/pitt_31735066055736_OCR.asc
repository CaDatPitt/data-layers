Pitt brings Bard

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

Though the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival will no
longer be spreading the works of the Bard to the Pittsburgh
community this summer, a piece of the festival still lives
on.

The Shakespeare in the Schools program, a surviving
unit of the festival, works to supplement the arts and cul-
tures curriculum in the region’s schools.

It “provides [schools] with something they couldn’t ordi-
narily do themselves,” said Bryn Jameson, artistic director
of Shakespeare in the Schools.

The Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival was canceled last
September when financial burdens and questions about the
direction of the festival made its continuance more of a
cost than a benefit. The Shakespeare in the Schools pro-
gram, however, was seen as an important vehicle for the
outreach of arts and culture, said Jameson. The program
was given a two-year test period to see how it develops
away from the structure of the festival.

This year’s tour is performing Shakespeare’s “Twelfth
Night,” a romantic comedy of love triangles and mistaken
identity. The tour, which started Jan. 23 and will travel to
parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia

Resting on the lawn

until the end of April, presents an adapted version of the
piece to school children from grades kindergarten through
12.

The program’s main goal is to foster appreciation for
Shakespeare’s works.

“It gets kids to think differently about Shakespeare,”
Jameson said. “A lot of kids probably think it’s all just
doublets and swords.”

Though the play is shortened to 45 minutes, enough to fit
into one class period, Jameson stresses that the language
has been left unchanged.

“If you act it well, it should be understandable by any
age,” Jameson said. “I think it’s important to keep [the lan-
guage] pure, because that’s what makes Shakespeare spe-
cial.”

The production has a little help this year in catching the
children’s attention with a bright and colorful set and a
soundtrack by the Beatles.

When one of the chief characters, Malvolio, gets duped,
the Beatles’ lyrics “he’s a real nowhere man” sing
along.

Jameson said it seemed only right to have the sounds of a
revolutionary musical group fill the interludes of a work

Tuesday night, the Student

Representatives of various stu-

the Greek Week organization,
SGB went through the appeals

final recommendations of the
SGB Allocations Committees
and then allowing time for
response and discussion, the
board proceeded in the follow-
ing way. First the original alloca-
tions decision was presented.
Then the student group represen-
tative was given three minutes in
which to respond. Only after this
was the recommendation of the
appeals committee heard. The
Board then put it up for discus-
sion and voted on the recom-
mendations of the committee.

LAZETE, Bosnia-Herzegovina
— As war crime investigators
began their.first search of this
area for evidence of mass
killings, an independent visit to
one of the most important sus-
pected mass graves on their itin-
erary showed indications of
extensive tampering.

The dirt in a large ﬁeld seemed
to have been recently turned and

This is the spot where hundreds

JERUSALEM — Stung by a
tough crackdown by Palestinian
and Israeli security forces, the
militant Islamic group Hamas
called for a resumption of suicide
attacks against Israel.

The call came from a leaﬂet
signed by the armed wing of
Hamas, the Qassam Brigades,
and followed the arrest of hun-
dreds of Muslim militants in
recent weeks and raids on dozens
of universities, mosques and
other institutions said to be
strongholds of Hamas. The crack-
down is in response to a wave of
bombings in Israel that killed 62

people. The New York Tmtes

BEIJING — Under pressure
from Washington and domestic
critics, Taiwan said that it would
postpone for at least three months
a live—fire military exercise on
Matsu Island, the heavily fortified

The postponement occurred
after Taiwan’s Prime Minister

NEW YORK -- A federal

the doctors in New York state
could legally help terminally ill

circumstances, striking down
parts of a longstanding state ban

The unanimous decision by a
three-judge panel of the Second

the second time in two months
that a federal appeals court has
ruled in favor of assisted suicide.

are battling over whether it is a
grave breach of conﬁdentiality —

A complaint being filed in fed-
eral district court in Boston seeks
an injunction blocking federal

The complaint cites an incident

Pitt students witnesses President Clinton's lrelcind speech

By Katie Delaney
For The Pitt News

(Editor’s note: This is the fourth
part of an occasioizal series chroni-
cling the writer’s fall semester
abroad.)

For as many times as I’ve been to
Washington, D.C., in my 22 years, it
took until I left the United States and
traveled to Ireland to see Bill
Clinton, or any American president
for that matter, in person.

I imagine if you’d taken an aerial
view of Dublin’s College Green
between 1 and 2:30 p.m. that day, I
could’ve been spotted in front of
Trinity College and the Bank of
Ireland as the one who was sand-
wiched between (I’m convinced) the
only two tall people who exist in
Ireland (most Irish people are lep-
rechaun-sized, honest).

I’ve never been so claustrophobic,
not even on my transatlantic flight,
as I was a magnet to the two human
towers that surrounded me so that
my face was pressed against the
green knapsack on the back of the
man in front of me.

I’ve never been physically pushed
around so much, not even at a con-
cert. l’ve never exercised my calves
so much by simply standing in one
place, as I was constantly on my toes
trying to catch even a glimpse of
Clinton (or Hillary — I heard she
had a new hairdo).

So there I was, an ocean away
from home, squashed between
80,000 eager people, mostly Irish,

t who came to hear President Clinton’s

words of wisdom on the peace
process. Parents took their children
out of school, adults took time off
work, college students skipped class-
es and shops closed for the after-

noon. All of City Centre, with the
exception of the garda (police force),
shut down.

Some people waved American and
Irish flags in unison while others
held banners or started chants of “we
want Bill.” The crowd seemed
almost devout (giving Clinton a new
dimension in my eyes), some refer-
ring to him as “the most powerful
man in the world.”

I must admit that I was pleasantly
surprised by his decorum. (I an atti-
tude toward Bill right now because
my brother, who is also my best
friend, has

received his “I dOI1’t View the pllI'p0S€ Of aness,

because there seemed to be a prevail-
ing attitude (at least at my college,
University College Dublin) of seri-
ously questioning what makes
American presidents believe that
they can solve the world’s problems.
The word floating around campus
was that it’s like sticking your nose
where it doesn’t belong.

I considered the opinions I heard,
but I didn’t agree with them. I don’t
view the purpose of a speech like the
one given as a mission to save the
world. I view it as a reminder that
peace can only be reached through
together-
and
there’ll be

year as a
result of the

act on the
responsibili-
ties that
-Katie Delaney arise from

peace papers
Clinton signed last week. Certainly I
know it’s not Clinton’s “fault,” but
I’m not above admitting that I need
— or want — someone to blame.)
One of the first things Clinton
greeted the crowd with was a special
hello to all the Americans in the
audience. For a split second, I was
homesick and wondered, if I beg
Bill, will he take me back to the
States with him? But then I remem-
bered that he was on his way to
Germany to see off U.S. troops going

to Bosnia, and I decided I’d like to

stay put after all. Good-byes with my
brother would be too upsetting.

I was leery of the impact Clinton’s
speech would have on the public,

that unity.
Yes, waging peace is risky, yet
reaching out for a new future of
peace is necessary because it’s a
process that involves everyday peo-
ple and changes their lives, “not
because peace is a document on
paper, or even a handshake among
leaders,” said Clinton.

There’s some spectacular patriotic
feeling — pride or maybe exuber-
ance —— grounded in a gathering such
as this. It’s equivalent to hearing the
national anthem at the Olympics ..
chilling in a sense. It’s like the
euphoric emotion you probably felt
if you saw Cal Ripken jog his heroic
lap around Camden Yards in
Baltimore after breaking the record

for consecutive games played. For
those few moments, Ripken was a
figure above and beyond the realm of
the general public, someone intangi-
ble, someone so high up on a
pedestal that you just couldn’t reach
him.

And then suddenly he did some-
thing completely human and down-
to-earth; he walked over to the
stands to find his wife in the crowd
and then kissed her and held one of
his daughters on the field in celebra-
tion. Only then was it clear that the
public raised him that high, not the
public figure himself.

Likewise with Clinton. Somewhere
in the middle of talking politics and
world peace and taking his place
behind a bullet-proof screen, he
managed to come down to earth to
address a small portion of the crowd
that waved Ballybunion placards
about the golf game he had to cancel.

“Let me say that, as a lot of you
know, because of "the events develop-
ing in Bosnia and the prospect of
peace there, I had to cut short my
trip. But there are a few signs out
there that I want to respond to. I will
return to Ballybunion for my golf
game." He also made reference to
the wonderful Irish culture that has
graced the world with the presence
of rock groups U2 from Dublin
(Bono happened to be standing in the
doorway of the Bank of Ireland) and
the Cranberries from Limerick.

The crowd applauded him loud and
clear, and I think it goes to show that
he appears to be the first American
president since Kennedy to be con-
sidered by young people as, well,
kinda cool. Clinton just made life
altogether real.

robbed

The PNC Bank in
Schenley Quad was the
scene of an attempted rob-
bery this past Tuesday. A 5-
foot-8-inch African
American dressed in a blue-
jean jacket waited in line at
approximately 12:30 p.m.
with a gun in a bag. He told
the teller he had the gun and
wanted the money in the
register.

As if this incident were
some late April Fool’s joke,
he ran out without any cash.

PNC security guard G.
Cox said that the assailant
didn’t appear to be a student
and acted nervous when he
was waiting in line. Cox
warned bystanders to stay
calm as the police were on
their way. Ten minutes later
the bank closed to allow
police to investigate the
attempted crime.

Bank teller Lisa Pensiero
said that the man had a gun,
but no one knew what was
going to happen at the time
the bank closed for the rest
of the afternoon.

A report was filed with
the Pitt Police, but no look-
out has been warranted
because of possible FBI
involvement.

Summer language study available

By Rebecca Briggs
Copy Editor

While most students are lazing around
and enjoying the warm weather this sum-
mer, 50 to 60 of them will be participating
in Pitt’s Russian and East European
Summer Language Intensives.

This program, which will celebrate its
10th anniversary this year, provides partic-
ipating students with beginning courses in
nine languages. More advanced students
may also take intermediate Slovak, Polish
and Serbian, as well as up to fourth-year
Russian.

The six-week East European language
courses run from June 24 until August 2,
while the Russian courses last eight
weeks, from June 10 until August 10.

The focus of the program is oral profi-
ciency, or “accelerated intensiveexposure
to the language,” according to its coordi-
nator, John Kachur. Students work on their
grammar, reading and listening compre-
hension skills for five hours a day in class
and eat and converse together at lunch.
They may also participate in a variety of
extracurricular activities such as the chess
club, the cooking club, receptions and
films, all of which are geared to foster fur-
ther cultural exposure.

“You come here as a total beginner and
get a very good background in the lan-

guage,” said Kachur.

Although most students are from the
Pittsburgh area, some come from other
parts of the country. Not all participants
are traditional students. Some are older
adults who wish to brush up on their lan-
guage skills before traveling to Eastern
Europe. According to Kachur, the program
has proved useful in the past to missionar-
ies hoping to spread their message in the
region.

“It is a wonderful way to get exposure
and get ahead in language training without
the distraction of the regular school year,”
said Kachur. “[It provides] a good prepa-
ration for going abroad.”

All students, whether from Pennsylvania
or out-of—state, pay in-state-tuition for the
credits, plus programs fees. Scholarships
for the undergraduate program are avail-
able and are based upon academic merit as
well as financial need. The deadline for
these scholarships is April. 10.
Applications for admission will be accept-
ed until the program starts.

Graduate students may apply for the
Foreign Language Area Stipend, which
provides full tuition as well as a stipend.

For more information about the program
or scholarships, call Kachur or Dova
Wilson at 624-5906, or visit the Slavic

Walkers
play with
fire

By Lisa Williams
F or The Pitt News

We have all been
warned not to play with
fire, but what about walk-
ing on it?

Logic dictates that fire
burns and could be deadly,
but there are actually peo-
ple who can walk on fire
and not get burned.

Al Fitzpatrick spoke
about this phenomenon
known as firewalking
Monday night in the first
floor conference room of
the Carnegie Library in
Oakland.

Fitzpatrick spoke about
the importance of studying
phenomena such as fire-
walking in order to
expand man’s knowledge
of mind, body and the
laws of nature.

Fitzpatrick said this phe-
nomenon baffles
researchers, and not even
the participants can offer
explanations.

“It defies the laws of
physics and the laws of
common sense,”
Fitzpatrick said.

Fitzpatrick is a graduate
of Kent State University
in Ohio. He began his

 3467 Bates st   career as a psychologist,

When the Nursing Students
Association’s budget came up,
Allocations Chairman Brian
Kavalukas said, “We have to be
cutting back budgets for every-
one in order to ﬁnish ahead in
the process,” as a general pref-
ace to the budget denials. When
the funding for trips to the state
and national capitals came up,
the representative from the
Nursing Students Association
explained that the trips were
meant to educate students about
political issues facing nurses
and not to promote any view-
point.

Board Member Lee Bannister
said that the trips looked like
lobbying trips to the board. “We
don't think that student groups
need to be doing [lobbying],”
Allocations Chair Brian
Kavalukas said, “because we do
a lot of lobbying. We thought
they could speak to our office.”

Although music and colorful sets work to keep the chil-
dren intrigued, the actors still have a challenging task in
getting the messages across to the younger crowds.

In the cast of seven, four are third-year MFA candidates
in Pitt’s Theatre Arts program. Jeri Misler, Laura Smiley,
Hillary Haft and Rebekah Slotnick are all part of this
year’s tour, which counts as acting training in place of
their work teaching. Misler describes this semester as
something like an internship that will bridge the gap into
the professional acting community.

Misler, who plays the role of Festes the clown, said that
in acting for children she had to perform her role even
more physically than she otherwise would have.

“Physica1ity is vital to the kids’ understanding the lan-
guage, appreciating it and having a good time,” Misler
said.

The story is what they really want, she said, while adults
may come to revel in the language or the poetry.

She said the fun of acting for children is seeing the pure
enjoyment on their faces as they wait to see what will hap-
pen next.

“We’re looking at them, and they are giving it right back
to us,” she said.

She added that, especially in the grades below seventh
or eighth, their suspension of disbelief is inspiring.

“There is a willingness to commit to what they are see-
ing,” she said. “They leave their skepticism at the door
and involve themselves in what they see.”

nature.

In these lectures,
Fitzpatrick emphasizes the
importance of exploring
these phenomena. He said
that it opens up a whole new
realm about what we still do
not know about the human
mind and the workings of
the body.

“We can all get up and say
it is a nice little story with
little relevance to me, but it
precludes something about
human nature we do not yet
know,” Fitzpatrick said.
“What we think of as hard
reality may only be our per-
ception of reality.”

Fitzpatrick became inter-
ested in firewalking when he
met Vernon E. Craig in Ohio
10 years ago. According to
Fitzpatrick, Craig, whose
stage name is Komar, holds
the title in the Guinness
Book of World Records for
walking on the hottest fire in
1976. The temperature of the

fire was 1,494 degrees
Fahrenheit.

According to Fitzpatrick,
Craig discovered his fire-
walking abilities in his 20s.
Fitzpatrick said that Craig
does not seem highly disci-
plined or athletic, and he
does not connect any reli-
gious reason to his ability to
firewalk. Fitzpatrick said
that Craig does not know
why he is able to firewalk.

Craig’s case is somewhat
unusual, because most fire-
walkers claim that their abil-
ity -is connected to their reli-
gion and occurs during reli-
gious ceremonies within the
community.

Firewalking is a world-
wide phenomenon. However,
the most frequent occur-
rences are in India, Greece,
China, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and Southeast Asia.

Fitzpatrick said there are
many theories that have
been proposed to explain the
firewalking phenomena,
such as extra thick skin on
feet, arranging the coals to
act as a heat conductor pro-
tecting the feet, applying
substances to the feet, or
firewalkers somehow have
the ability to control how
their feet perspire.

Although research is being
done, no theory has yet been
able to explain these peo-
ple’s ability to firewalk.

Fitzpatrick said that con-

" tinuing: the researchand

exploring“ logiic-defying

phenomena promotes peo-

ple’s knowledge of them-
selves, and makes them take
a second look at the world
which science strives to
explain.

The next lecture will be
held Monday, April 8, on the
latest research in Medical
Recoveries. It explores cases
in which people were diag-
nosed as terminally ill and
beat the odds. The lecture
will be held in the first floor
conference room of the
Carnegie Library in
Oakland.

Opinions

Open street brawling

If you have all the answers, don’t ask any questions.

That message is for City Council President Jim Ferlo. Why did
you waste everyone’s time Tuesday night by holding a public hear-
ing on the proposed Bigelow Boulevard closing when you already
knew that you were going to vote against it?

Pitt students (well, around 50 of them), finally shed their apathet-
ic skin and showed up at the hearing. They want Bigelow closed,
and some of them spoke for the closing.

Interim Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke, as did Vice-
Chancellor for Student and Public Affairs Leon Haley. They also
tried to convince the council to vote for the closing, as did the city
planning director, the parking director and other Pitt and city offi-
cials.

Ferlo sat back in his chair and took it all in. But it was clear from
his attitude towards the pro-closure speakers where his opinion lay.
At one point, he asked the city planning director, “Do you have any
other tests, bogus or otherwise?”

Sure, it was only a joke and brought some laughter from the
crowd, but this wasn’t the Funnybone. It was a public hearing,
where at least in principle, the voters have a chance to change
things.

That’s right, Jim. Change things. And if you’re not careful about
how you deal with Pitt, the largest constituency you have, then
maybe the City Council president will change names.

Light ‘em up and sue

Here’s a news ﬂash: Nicotine is addictive. In case any of you
have never smoked or never known a smoker at some point in your
life, 60 law firms are making it their business to make sure every-
one knows it and gets paid for knowing it.

A class action suit is currently in progress, in which 60 firms
across the country are lining up litigants to sue tobacco companies
for concealing the fact that nicotine is addictive and for adding
nicotine to cigarettes to keep all the smokers smoking.

The question is, does anyone out there deny that smoking is

- addictive? The tobacco companies deny that they hid that fact

(which they couldn’t have) and that they manipulated tobacco lev-
els (which remains to be seen). However, the more important ques-
tion is, exactly what do the lawyers hope to gain by filing this suit?

The only possible answer is money.

A huge contingency fee lurks in the comers if lawyers success-
fully sue the tobacco companies. Anyone named as a claimant in
the class action will be financially rewarded for having a bad habit.

If tobacco companies lied, they should be fined -— heavily —— by
the groups that govern the rules of business and sales. But even if
people “knew” (officially, that is) that nicotine was addictive, there
would still be cigarette companies and there will always be smok-
ers.

So smoke ‘em if you got ‘em, then call the lawyer nearest you.

The three drunk chicks and me

So campers, up for a quick
story and a quiz? Let me just set
the tone for those of you who
crave all the smarmy details. On
Friday last, I ended up in an
Oakland establishment that
serves alcohol, with three wast-
ed female companions. (Get
your minds out of the gutter!) It
was a birthday celebration for
two of my companions and I
traveled along as a designated
driver. As the evening pro-
gressed my companions became
more and more intoxicated. To
put it bluntly, they got falling-
down drunk and at approximate-
ly 10 p.m. we departed from
said establishment onto the
streets of Oakland for the jour-
ney home. On the way to the car
I noticed how unsafe and
exposed to attack we were.

At this point those of you who
are still reading are saying, “So
what, Mac? Get to the point or
at least tear into someone.” OK,
the people I’m going to slam are
going to include you. Yes you!
Sitting right there, you unin-
formed, foolish little campers
wandering the streets of
Oakland filled with stress,
spring fever and a few beers.
Don’t worry, the school is just as
much to blame for your igno-
rance about the teeming streets
around you. Remember
Freshman Indoctrination  er,
sorry, I mean Orientation?
When we learned the impor-
tance of diversity and multicul-
turalism and how to access the
Net and respect our differences.
Oh yes, and you got handouts
on VanCall and Sexual Assault
Services and were told to “be
careful out there.” Not that this
stuff is less than vital to fresh-
men, but let’s go ahead and take
the quiz, shall we? (Don’t
worry, if you pass that’s good; if
you don’t, the answers are print-
ed next to the question.)

How many assaults were there
on campus this year? (Twenty
reported, there were many more
than that, I assure you.)

Does travelling in a group
makes you safe? (No.)

Patrick
McKelvey

Whose turf is the “O” on? (It’s
presently neutral territory.)

Did you see a gang member
today? (Would you know it if
you did?)

Are police are always avail-
able to help you when you’re in
danger? (Ask the 20 people
from question #1.)

Are you aware of your sur-
roundings at all times? (Picture
where you are sitting and then
look up to see if it matches your
idea. Not so good, huh?)

You have a friend who knows
karate and she showed you
some kicks and stuff. If you get
into trouble you can handle
yourself if it came down to a
brawl, right? (If you need me to
answer this one  ) If you do
get jumped that canister of
MACE buried in the crevices of
your book bag should do the
trick, right? (Mom said, “It’s an
urban campus honey. Here, take
this, Lord knows I hope you
never need it.”) To be honest, I
hope you don’t need to use it
either. Do you know its range?
Here’s an easy one: Do you
know how to aim it? No? You
might as well take it off your
key chain and leave it at home
with all the rest of Mom’s good
intentions.

In case you are getting the
idea that this little diatribe is
aimed solely at my female read-
ers, and “Anybody jumpin’ me
is in for the beating of a life-
time,” listen up. In the Fall, a
group of six of my friends were
assaulted from behind in South
Oakland and the assailants ran
off. Bing, Bang, Bop —— the lit-
tle thugs were gone. Does the
name Kevin Cecil mean any-
thing to you? How about the
guy who was beaten into a coma
on the Towers steps while some
cowardly fellow students
walked by and didn’t do a damn
thing? Think that it can’t happen

to you, tough guy? Better think '

again, badass. If it sounds like
I’m being harsh here. too bad.

I’d rather see pissed-off
AWARE people around me than
the sheep I see now. All that
aside, we return now to the
Friday night in question.

As I walked along Forbes, I
started to try to think like a
mugger and looked around for
some victims. They were every-
where: an open purse here, two
drunk buddies trying to negoti-
ate the steps outside Bruce Hall,
a lone pedestrian there, the usual
insanity outside the “O” and, of
course, the caravan I found
myself the shepherd of. Today I
tried the same thing again as I
walked to school from South
Oakland (just in case Friday
night was an abenation of your
attention span). Not surprisingly
there are a plethora of you out
there who seem "to want to be
assaulted. The sunshine and
hustle of everyday life seems to
make us all a little careless. The
key here is paying attention.
This is strictly a pass/fail course
and if you fail you may wind up
beaten, raped, robbed or dead.
And all your Mom’s good inten-
tions will be for naught.

There is a solution here.
campers, and I want to share it
with you. When you register for
Fall classes, sign up for a course
called “Self Defense”. offered by
Curtis Smith up at Trees Hall.
The “Buy Yourself A Minute"
class can save Mom’s little
camper from harm. Anyway. it’s
worth the credits and it will
open your eyes in a big way to
what is going on out here. At
worstyou may get a chance to
kick the living daylights out of
me. The trick is to see trouble
BEFORE it comes kicking in
your door. You need to know
what you can or can't do in a
crisis. So stop walking around
like a victim looking for a crime
and start acting like you want to
survive here.

Tennis serves up Eclinor,-0

Team needs just two
victories to set school record

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

Columnist
Sean
Duncan

fter two years of incom-

plete seasons, things

appear to be status quo
in baseball. Barring any unex-
pected player or ump strikes, or
front office lockouts, we the
fans can ﬁnally see baseball as
it really is — the best sport in
the world.

In this column you will not
read anything that’s remotely
poignant. You will not read
anything about the sad state of
baseball. And you will not read
anything about Sixto Lezcano.
But what you will read is the
Top 10 things to look for in the
1996 baseball season. Without
any further ado 

10.) The assassination of
Marge Schott, the grotesque
owner of the Cincinnati Reds.
Through the years,'Schott has
tried her bestto offend as many
people as possible while mak-
ing herself look stupid in the
process. Whether it’s sluning
racial comments at her players
or banning smoking in her sta-
dium only to be caught on tape
smoking, Schott has the uncan-
ny knack of the insanely stupid.
But this time she has gone t.o
far. 1

After umpire John Mcsherry
died of a heart attack at
Cincinnati’s home opener,
Schott treated the situation like
an apathetic Pitt student. In
fact, the only thing that she
cared about was how much
money she was going to lose
because of the game’s cancella-
tion. This is the same Schott
who expected everyone to
mourn the loss of her lucky
dog. I guess a dog is more
important than a person who
invested 25 years in profession-
al baseball — or any person for
that matter.

9.) Sticking with the death
theme, Randy Johnson, the
Seattle Mariners 6-foot-10 fire-
baller, will accidentally kill
somebody with his 100 m.p.h.
fastball. No one has been killed
by a pitch since Ray Chapman
died in 1920, but knowing
Johnson’s tendency to uncork a
wild pitch here and there, ‘96
could be the year of the “Death
Ball.”

8.) Frank Thomas, the

‘Column, page 11

The Pitt tennis team moved one step closer to a
school record with a 9-0 lambasting of a weak -
Edinboro University squad on Tuesday afternoon.

The win improved the Panthers to 10-7, just two
victories short of tying the record. The team has at
least seven matches left, maybe more depending on
how well it performs at the Big East Championship.

But the pressure of chasing a record was barely evi-
dent during Tuesday’s match against the Lady Scots at
Edinboro.

In singles competition, all five Panthers defeated
their opponents in two sets. And only Mandy Ahwesh,
Edinboro’s No. 1 seed, scored more than two points
(she had three) in a set.

.The Panthers also won both doubles matches and
picked up two more wins by default.

“It was nice to have a match where we could go out
there and relax and have some fun,” Pitt Coach George
Dieffenbach said. “Edinboro was down this year.
They’re rebuilding.” ,

Fran Davis, Pitt’s No. 1 seed, defeated Ahwesh 6-3,
6-2.

The other scores looked much the same. Freshman ,
Erin Shalbrack, Pitt’s No. 2 seed, beat Cathy
Kinderman, 6-2, 6-0. Alison Baker won 6-1, 6-0.
Marla Zielinski won 6-0, 6-1. And Jen Bible won 6-1,
6-0.

In doubles, the results were similar. The team of
Davis and Zielinski beat Ahwesh and Kinderman, 8-5.
Later, senior Kristen Siegel teamed with freshman
Courtney Aronowsky for an 8-2 victory.

The match went so smoothly for Pitt, in fact, that Edinboro on Ihesday. Zielinski won her singles and doubles matches.

when Dieffenbach was asked to name Panthers who
played particularly well, he replied, “Everybody played
well.”
‘But then Dieffenbach mentioned Davis, who had gotten
back on track after dropping her past couple of matches.
“Fran Davis was suffering some close losses,” Dieffenbach

gives her more confidence.” ‘

Locrosse levels lowly

Bethany College, 20-l

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

After a weekend of top-notch opponents, the men’s

1 lacrosse team demolished lowly Bethany College, 20-

1, last Tuesday in the mud of West Virginia, improv-
ing its record to 7-4.

“We dominated the entire game,” said Head Coach
Gary Neff. “They were just a horrible team.”

Pitt jumped to a 12-1 halftime lead. It then let up in
the second half, but still managed eight goals.

“We held back in the second half,” said attacker
Marc Polecritti. “After the game was in our hands, we
didn’t try to go one-on-one with their players because
any player on our team could beat any player on their
team. It was almost like a practice.”

Polecritti also said, “We tried plays against them
that we couldn’t attempt against better teams. We only
wanted to score on good passes.”

This match produced some monster stats. Polecritti
led the way with five goals and five assists. Mike
Tanniru led the team in assists with six and added
four goals of his own. Dave Walter chipped in seven
points with three goals and four assists.

Midfielder Rob Heaps netted four and assisted on
two. Pat Shea scored the fifth hat trick of the game
with an assist. Pete Choi had one goal and one assist
to round out the scoring.

“This game was a good cushion after the tough
games we played in the tournament. It got the teams
spirits up,” said Polecritti. ‘

In this game, Pitt adjusted to playing on grass for
the first time this year.

“It’s a slower game on grass,” said Neff. “The ball
does not have a true bounce, and there is more contin-

Lisa Kron is the friendly les-

into mainstream comedy she
noticed that her performance
was excessively alternative to
her audience. ‘‘I’m a big les-
bian that didn't fit in well,”
commented Kron. Following
her heart’s desire to seek a
place in theatre, Kron found
her home in crevices of les-
bian/alternative theatre. Kron
works with a group out of New
York City called The Five
Lesbian Brothers, which is an
Obie-winning theatre compa-
ny. Together, this group tours
around the country promoting
an innovative interpretation
about homosexuality in the
‘90s.

different types of lesbians that
characterize the homosexual
subculture. “There are jocks,
chics, colors, and even profes-
sional lesbians,” explained
Kron. “There is a lesbian for
every type of person.” Some
lesbians are politically active,
and some lesbians use more
creative ways to speak their
minds, as in Kron’s case.
Kron, along with The Five
Lesbian Brothers, was asked
to write a Book of Humor for
Simon & Schuster covering
their pervasive anecdotes on
queers.

“There is an assumption that
there is an abnormality with
|esbians,” said Kron. ‘‘I’m not
going to apologize for who I
am.” Finding stand-up comedy
more acceptable to her freind-
ly persona, Kron pulls the
audience into her fabricated
farces. Kron has a skilled

  

physical presence on stage
that is tremendously comical
and cynical.

Kron’s jovial narrative about
her junior high wedgy that
resulted in a childhood com-
plex makes her performance
easily laughable. Typically per-
forming for open-minded,
straight audiences, Kron feels
that her offbeat satires are
more accepted in the stand-up
comedy globe. “l found a gen-
tle world, open to voices and
points of view.” Kron
entrances her audience with
explicit details and farces that
might be overlooked if it
weren’t for her brilliant presen-
tation. Finding humor in her
personal life, and provoking
the audience to laugh with her,
has created a wave in lesbian
comedy.

The alternative stage is
being characterized by young
acts like Kron’s. Performers
believe that the stage is a
place where artists can come
clean and express themselves

in any way they feel like.
Women in comedy have had
to confront the mainstream
masculine humor that has
dominated the stage for years.
Women like Sarah Felder
(note last week’s article) and
Lisa Kron are setting a prece-
dent for female artists trying to
find their place in the theatrical
world. A generation ago homo-
sexuality was isolated and not
as accepted as it is in today’s
publicized entertainment
world. Bringing new perspec-
tives and young ideals into an
already cosmopolitan commu-
nity is what alternative media
prides itself on.

smiling he stated my duties

This Monday, April 8, at 8
p.m., locals Blunderbuss, ska
giants The Stubborn All-Stars
and Chicago's own decon-
structionist writer/ranter
Wesley Willis and his Fiasco
will appear at Luciano's. This
is a show unlike any other. It's
all there, except for the steel
cage.

Blunderbuss provides the
indie component of the show.
playing their native blend of
noisy heavy, hard-hitting, gui-
tar rock. They'll be showcas-

ing new material written since
their last release Conspiracy
(Homestead Records). If you
like a little noise with your cof-
fee, this is for you.

The Stubborn All—Stars are
the grizzled veterans of the
ska world, having played in
famous bands like The
Toasters, among others, for
years. These guys were play-
ing way back before you even
came to college and found
out those checkered skin-
heads weren't Nazis. To use

the obligatory ska pun, they're
not Skahnny-come-latelies.
Hell, you might even hear
some classic Jamaican—style
riffs before the night is out.
Lastly, Wesley Willis returns
to Pittsburgh with his pop~cul-
ture references and righteous
raves. Wesley really is a men-
tal patient in every sense of
the word (we‘re talking med-
ication here), but his observa-
tions on life, delivered over a
heavy punk musical back-
drop. aren‘t to be missed.

Skip the bootleg tapes and
see him live.

Finally, for all you egghead,
bookworm, artistic types out
there, Daniel Morrow will give
a performance reading of his
work Ondine. Featuring musi-
cians and theatrical elements.
Morrow‘s reading will elabo-
rate on his book about the
Warhol film superstar. It all
takes place at Borders in the
South Hills on Saturday, April
6.

April 4 1 996

I picked up The Truth Hurts
#3 at the free show at
Benedum that was sponsored
by the University Democrats
and the New Youth Culture
anti-hate group on March 15. It
was a pretty decent show, Anti-
Flag, Blindsight and Her Eleven
Cats played. What? You didn't
know about it? That's because
the University of Pittsburgh
didn't want you to know about
it. All posting of fliers was for-
bidden, except for a couple
signs on Benedum itself, which
went up the day of the show.
There was also one small ad
buried in The Pitt News, and
that was it. Think about that.

Anyway, I bought the zine for
a quarter from the editor. On
the front, it says it contains “the
usual zine stuff," and while it is
pretty stereotypical in the type
of stuff in it, the writing and lay-
out are strong enough that the
zine is interesting to read... .

There's some personal writ-
ing about leaving Denver to go
to college (I hope Pittsburgh
hasn’t been too much of a dis-
appointment), getting a tattoo
and why small, independent
shows are better than faceless
corporate rock. The piece
about how welfare oppresses
the poor more than no welfare
would is interesting (through a
handout, the poor are made too
complacent to rise up), and the
tear-out postcards to send to
Proctor and Gamble to get
them to stop animal-product
testing are good, because they
involve the reader. There’re
also a lot of band pictures, and
while the pictures themselves
are pretty good, some of them
are hurt by the photocopied

  

Bertholdo, respectiely, are
particularly skillful in this
respect. Julie Koch’s Dr.
Genoni is notably convincing in
her performance as the judi-
cious and meticulous doctor
and is refreshingly sincere. The
Futurist ensemble displayed an
adequate amount of energy
and verve in the roles — Tim
Golebiewski is especially ani-
mated while promoting the
Futurist mission. Overall, the
show moves quickly over two-
and-a—half hours because of
focused acting and is aided by
the greasy and entertaining
heh-heh-heh’s intermittenly
emanated by John Koch’s
Belcredi.

As I mentioned in the pre-
view for Enrico IV, since uni-
versity theatre is not restrained

reproduction. The zine review
goes into more detail than most
review sections do. It's obvious
that the editor read the zines
closely. Write: 9999 E. Yale
Ave #F-201/ Denver, Colorado
80231. The zine’s a quarter in
person, and three stamps
through the mail would proba-
bly be enough.

Jive lnjection #2 covers the
Buffalo, N.Y. music scene. As
such, I think it is most interest-
ing if you live in the area.
There’re a lot of writing and
reviews and interviews with
bands, and very little else. Most
of the music seems to be in the
alternative or hard rock vein.
As a matter of fact, the only
non-music item in the zine is a
“Horrorscope.” Mine was: “Lady
Luck will smile upon you today.
Unfortunately, that’s all she'll
do. Nothing happens.” Very
cute. I can see this zine being a
valuable resource for the area,
and if I was ever to go to
Buﬁalo, l_,would.9|.a.nCe1hr0U9h
it to see what"s"g6ing on. The
zine’s $1 ppd to: 21 Arnold St./
Buffalo, NY 14213-1908.

show that has the courage to

Cracker

The Golden Age
Virgin Records

l’ve spent the last day and a
half listening to the new
Cracker album, The Golden
Age, and upon first impres-
sion, Cracker appears to be
backsiiding. David Lowry has
gotten too caught up in trying
to be a “Great Experimenter of
Rock ‘n’ Roll” and has forgot-
ten that Cracker was a band
that was born to express the
guts and intensity of the very
talented core of musicians that
came together for the music.

This album, in contrast to
Cracker's last effort, Kerosene
Hat, is over-produced, over-
complicated with unnecessary
instrumentation and a bit weak
in the conviction department.
When he fronted the avante-
folk outfit, Camper Van
Beethoven, Lowry was fighting
to play folk rock in an era
where synth pop and New
Wave were the rule of the day.
Lowry left Camper Van
Beethoven to form Cracker, a
much tighter, stripped-down
rock outfit that kicked ass and
took names in a way that the
lighter, less gutsy Camper Van
Beethoven never could.
Cracker’s first album was a
reasonable market success,
driven by the force of the
“Teen Angst (What the world
needs now)” single that took
college radio by storm. Lowry,
a college radio fave for years,
finally found a voice in which
to speak to larger audiences in
the form of Cracker.

Two of the biggest reasons
for that success were the
amazingly talented and soulful
Johnny Hickman on lead gui-
tar and bassist extrordinaire,
Davey Faragher. Hickman’s
Neil Young-meets-Led
Zeppelin guitar lines created
an energy that, woven into the
tapestry of Lowry’s simple and
catchy melodies, took the folk-
rock genre to a new level.
Faragher’s stripped-down,
funky bass style was an
unlikely, but somehow perfect-
ly suited, match for the
Hickman/Lowry team. Songs
like “This is Cracker Soul” and
“Get off of This” owe their ton-
of-bricks groove to Faragher’s
basslines as much, or more,
than anything else. And it was
Faragher’s ability to create
space, to know when not to
play, and to somehow express
that intangible essence of soul
into even the simplest and
slowest of songs, that helped
create the well-rounded sound
of Cracker. Now, Faragher is
gone and his absence is
incredibly conspicuous on The

 

 

  

Golden Age.

lt’s not that this is a bad
album by any means. It just
does not measure up to the
standard set by Kerosene Hat.
Granted, Lowry set the bar
pretty high for his band, but
somewhere along the way the
soul got lost, or at least dis-
tilled. Somehow, some of the
chemistry went with Faragher.
Bob Fiupe proves to be a com-
petent bassist but hardly wor-
thy of filling Faragher’s shoes.
Faragher just had that special,
intangible and oh-so-rare qual-
ity of soul that can't be
defined, bought, taught, pack-
aged or replaced. Even rarer
was Faragher’s ability to go
into the studio and make that
soul stick to tape. So, in his
absence, Lowry and Hickman
went in search of new fron-
tiers. What they came up with
was an album that tries to
compensate for a drop in the
quality of songwriting and
band unity by overburdening
tracks with endless piano,
steel guitar, keyboard, backing
vocal and string tracks. Lowry
and Co. never skated the line
of Glam rock enough to pull off
a fully orchestrated string
arrangement, and it shows. in
a quest to. be “experimental,”
Lowry and co-producer David
Herring have taken away
Cracker’s anchor of simplicity
and allowed this album to be
washed away in the-tides of
self-indulgence and overpro-
duction.

There are some good
moments. The single for ‘‘I
Hate My Generation” is getting
a lot of commercial airplay and
certainly rocks a lot harder
than most of the candy-pop
grunge bands that are current-
ly littering this nation's so-
called “Alternative” and “New
Rock” airwaves. David Lowry
can still craft a song better
than most guys out there.
Johnny Hickman is one of the
best rock guitarists out there
and he pulls some solos on
this album that leave my jaw
hanging open at the beautifully
simple yet elegant phrasing
that he manages to eke out of
his old Les Paul Eldorado.

Guest appearances by the
likes of Tony Maimone (bass),
David lmmergluck (pedal
steel) and Joan Osborne
(backing vocals) are certainly
nice, and it's good to see a lit-
tle old fashioned music indus-
try nepotism at work, but
there’s just no reason for it all.
lt’s too much. It just seems like
Cracker is trying so hard not to
be pigeonholed by MTV and
commercial radio that they are
caving into the very pressures
they set out to avoid. To make
a conscious effort to make an
album that is markedly differ-
ent from previous material is,

April 4 1 996

in this case at least, just one
expression of the self-con-
sciousness that major label
fame and PR hype can create.
The success of the last album
also gave the band a chance
to rest on their laurels and
plan their next move a bit too
thoroughly. By trying to avoid
expectations, Cracker has
backed themselves into a cre-
ative corner of their own con-
coction. And that’s a mouthful.
Bottom line: There are a lot of
good ideas on this album, but
few good songs. The loss of
Faragher set Cracker back
tremendously. Hopefully this
album will put Cracker’s back
to the wall. it seems to be
where they thrive.

The Drag City Hour
Various Artists
Drag City

Finally available after years
of speculation, rumors,
promises and denial, The
Drag City Hour is essentially a
bunch of fairly stupid skits
linked together by live perfor-
mances by some incarnation
of three of the greatest groups
of ourtime.

Originally broadcast live on
WMBR in Cambridge in 1992,
the show includes songs by
Smog, Palace, and an all-star
jam session with the always-
soulful Neil Haggarty (Royal
Pussy) perpetratin’ some
(ahem.) spoken word on the
mic.

Buy the record for this last
jam alone, titled “Fairy
Godmother.” Anyone who is a
fan of Rolling Stones-quality
PUNKROCK and blissed-out
psychedelia, funked-up with a
white junkie gangsta twist,
should immediately pick up
the entire available Royal Trux
discography, before the shit
gets confiscated by the Secret
Committee of Monsters Who
Run This Planet. l’m tellin’ you
kids, the world is going
straight down the toilet, and
sometimes the only thing that
allows me to make sense of it
is a good old Trux record.

Jennifer Herema is notice-
ably absent from this one,
unless she’s the one playing
the Korg or shaking the mara-
cas, but for some reason I
doubt that. The song is almost
20 minutes long, with basically
one riff playing throughout,
and it is beautiful. Bob “Smog”
Callahan plays on this song
also.

Between-band comic inter-
ludes are provided by The Sea
Note Players, who seem to
suffer from having watched
too much Ren & Stimpy and
Cheech ‘n’ Chong. lt’s all in
the name of fun, though, and
it’s in sharp—as-shit contrast to
the intense sounds produced
by the Smog and Palace
(introduced by Haggarty).

Smog is less intimate and
more rockin’ on this one, and it
works just fine. Palace is as
Palace does, and Will

Pittsburgh really hasn't had
the luxury of a reel celluloid
demonoid on the scene in a
long, long while. Hell, at least
since last Fall when we had not
just one, but two, of the most
important figures in American
cinema working in town.
“Things just haven't been the
same since Sharon and Jean-
Claude left,” Orgone’s Mike
Johnsen tells me. “We’re now
looking at cinema in ways we
never thought were possible.”*
Just kidding, shitty, (lest you
took me seriously, stop reading
and go pick up the City Paper)
because Orgonomic activity
has been ever-so prolific
recently (back-to-back week-
ends of programming are wel-
comed any month).“lf you’re
like me and you missed “X
Films” last weekend (we suck),
you might be able to redeem
yourself this Friday night with
Orgone at the Warhol.

But all you respectable audi-
ences should stay home and
rent While You Were Sleeping,
Bad Boys and Forget Paris.
You’ll like them, I swear. Mr.
George Kuchar doesn’t want
none of ya anyhow. Hailing
from the San Francisco art
scene of the ‘60s, Kuchar has
been. making,inn,ovative films
for decades, and they are now
staples of any experimental
film class worth its course title.
Cinephiles everywhere will rec-
ognize the titles Ascension of
the Demonoids, I an Actress

 

and the extremely funny Hold
Me While I'm Naked as
Kuchar’s mock-ups of the slick
Hollywood look with his keen
camp humor and schmarmy
aesthetics. Ever kitschy, campy
and kooky, Kuchar’s films pro-
vide the lust-of-life that tight-
ass prudes hate and you’ll
love.

But recently, Kuchar has
turned in the Super-8 camera
for a Videorecorder to photo-
graph a batch of films about I-
don‘t-know—what-but-l-trust-
they’re-great. The videos are
all supposedly edited in-cam-
era, and seem to focus on hal-
lowed Americana moments, sit-
uations and holidays. Friday

' night’s program, which Kuchar

will be on hand to discuss,
includes (in George’s words):

Homes For the Holidays is
a 1996 tape celebrating the
Christmas/New Year affair and
the acquisition of a -new home
for my friend, Jerome. We
enter his modern unit and meet
the neighbors as they display
their paintings and idiosyn-
crasies.

Weather Diary 5 has me
holed up in an Oklahoma Motel
as the weather threatens the
residents of that region with
wetness, overheated obesity
and storm-force flatulence. A
study in regional climatology
and crumminess.

Baldies of Burgermeister
Bungalow is about some bald-
ing guys waiting for the meat to
sizzle at a 4th of July barbe-

  

cue. It was meant as a celebra-
tion of patriotic flesh-eaters but
turned out to be a frightening
carnival of carnivores.

Anniversary Schmaltz tips
its hat to the San Francisco Art
lnstitute’s 125th birthday and
drops its drawers to all who
create art and paint rear ends.

Point ‘n’ Shoot — a
Valentine featuring a nice
home with iced drinks and a
hunk in hot water.

As if that weren’t enough
culcha, the Warhol has stock-
piled much of Kuchar’s work
and is ready to unleash it this
April. George Kuchar is quite
the arbiter of bad taste, so
don't miss any of these fine
programs: '

April 10-14: Hold Me While
I'm Naked and Corruption of
the Damned will be shown.
~ April 17-21: Leisure, Moshola
Holiday, -Eclipse of the Sun
Virgin, Color Me Shameless
and Encyclopedia of the
Blessed are scheduled.

April 24-28: I, an Actress and
The Devil's Cleavage will run.

All of these shows will begin
at 7:30 p.m., but call 237-8300
for more information. Friday
night's show will cost you a
mere $3. But be sure to head
before 8 p.m., as show begins
then, at 117 Sandusky Street.
Don't miss George live! '

*This is a complete lie, Mike
Johnsen never said any of this.

Enrico IV

Pitt Theatre
translated by Lina lnsana
directed by David Pellegrini

Madness, the motivation
behind art and theatre, and the
ever-consuming, confounding
nature of language are some of
the issues explored in David
Pellegrini’s production of Luigi
Pirandello’s Futurist play,
Enrico IV. Pirandello contem-
plates madness and all of its
ancillaries, delving into the
meaning of language and its
epistemological bounds
through a Foucalt-like exami-
nation of life and how time's
permanent and indefinite
nature can create labels like
“madman” and “imbecile.”

The show opens with a blar-
ing statement of intent by a
Futurist (Aaron Christian
Harms) and an audio-visual
montage of Squonk Opera-like
movements and sounds that
incorporated an ensemble of
Futurists (Harms, Daniel
Massaro, Bob Reufle,
Dawnelle Stutzman, Tim
Golebiewski and Rachel Wynn)
introducing the Futurist artistic
mission of change and forward

movement in expression.

The story of Enrico IV is as
convoluted as the many ideas
that Pirandello explores; Enrico
IV (Kevin J. Wetmore) is simply
“mad.” After falling from a
horse while riding in a historical
pageant, he believes himself to
be an 11th-century German
emperor excommunicated by
the Pope. This being estab-
lished, the show is then a com-
plex array of analyses of
Enrico’s psychology through
philosophical discussions with
his servants (Howard Williams,
Jr., Joe Manganiello, Tim
Wisniewski, Dennis Pennell)
and different people trying to
understand him, like the metic-
ulous Dr. Genoni (Julie Koch),
the exceedingly Italian Tito
Belcredi (John Koch), Lady
Matilde and her daughter (Mari
Pappas and Lori Sharpless)
and the slick Carlo di Nolli
(Shawn Ebbert). Enrico expati-
ates about the meanings of
words and how labels are
uniquely interpreted by both
the speaker and the listener in
the midst of being psychologi-
cally dissected by the doctor
and Belcredi. He voices many
Futurist and modernist ideas
dealing with death and its com-

 

   

 

mencement immediately after
birth. He also talks of the
pressing problem of time and
its artistic limits; even though
time is impossible to pinpoint,
art always permanently fixes
itself in a certain moment.

Kevin J. Wetmore’s perfor-
mance as Enrico can be accu-
rately described as sincere. He
probes the character of Enrico
carefully without giving in to a
static, hackneyed portrayal of
the stock mad European
emperor. Wetmore shows
Enrico’s human dynamics and
gives his words a meaning that
transcends their stasis. He
stays true to the Futurist mis-
sion of forward movement and
change. When he describes
the death of an individual start-
ing at birth he forcefully dis-
plays the power of words and
their residual effects; he gives
the character the kind of ethe-
real and subtle attention that
the text demands.

Enrico’s servants play their
roles with a balanced amount
of humor and sense of philo-
sophical awareness. Howard

Pennell as Landolpho and

“Despite your eyes, you won’t

Jimmy Silva’s “harvest-core”
mixes traditional sounds like
the mandolin, accordion, har-
monica and ethereal e-bow to
create a very proud, honest,
blue-collar sound that would
seem justas practical in the
19th century as it does in the

20th. The quick fiddle—on“

“Come What May” and the
grass-roots slide guitar on the
aforementioned “Tell it to the

(Editor's Note: The following is a preview of
the American League's West Division)

1.) Seattle Mariners: Since the format change,
the AL West has been a division built on one
name — Griffey. Junior and his teammates took
the pennant last season, winning a rare one-game
playoff against the California Angels on the way
to a classic series with the Yankees and a
respectable showing in the ALCS. However, post-
season raids on the Mariners and rebuilding
efforts by the rest of the West should keep this the
closest division in baseball.

But let’s not be too hasty. Even without some
key pieces like Tino Martinez and Andy Benes,
the Mariners are the favorites to repeat.

The reason —— Griffey, again. Ken Griffey, Jr.
has lead this team since he was a rookie in 1989.
He has kept the team in Seattle despite threats of
relocation. His presence practically won the city
funding for a new baseball—only stadium. And
he’s running for president, sort of.

All this from a guy who hit .258 last season and
is coming off a broken wrist that had some visible
negative effects on his hitting upon his return.
National celebrity has helpedblur his question-
mark status for the upcoming season, and even if
he does return to form, he’ll need some offensive
help.

Enter Jay Buhner. Not a candidate for public
office, Buhner still hit 40 homeruns last season
while batting four points higher than Griffey and
nearly earning a Gold Glove in the process.
Further help comes from the remaining Martinez,
Edgar, who won the AL batting title last season,
hitting at a .356 clip and decimating lefty pitching
with a .433 average.

On the mound, as is Mariner custom, the major-
ity of the work will be entrusted to Randy
Johnson. The Big Unit is coming off an 18-2
record last season, striking out 294 batters and

becoming famous for nearly killing batters with

Also suspect is his support, which consists of
only two ten-game winners from last season.
Sterling Hitchcock, acquired from the Yankees,
and returning Chris Bosio will shoulder the rest of
the burden, with ALCS surprise Bob Wolcott fig-
uring to make a mark. A mix of quality relievers
(Bobby Ayala, Norm Charlton, Paul Menhart) and
some creative managing from AL Skipper of the
Year Lou Pinella should keep Mariner arms com-
petitive.

2.) California Angels: Recovering from last sea-
son’s collapse, the Angels are set to topple the
Mariner bandwagon. Fresh off an off-season that

to buy the
club, the Angels have been able to return nearly
all of their star players for the 1996 campaign.
Leading the charge are a trio of young halos,
J.T. Snow, Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon, who
figure to provide most of California’s offensive
punch. Salmon hit .330 last season, knocked 34
home runs and registered 105 RBI, good enough
for a top—lO finish in all three categories.

The Pitt News, Thursday, April 4, 1996

9 .
Griffey Jr., Big Unit thrust Mariners ahead in AL West

Edmonds is the team’s returning RBI leader with
107, while Snow’s 22-double, 24-homer perfor-
mance may have given the switch-hitter claim to
the first-base spot into the next century.

Mark Langston leads the hurlers into battle,
boasting a 15-7 record despite a 4.63 ERA last
year. Chuck Finley, Mike Harkey and Shawn
Boskie look to fill out the rotation, without an
ERA below four among them.

The strength comes in relief, with the ageless
Lee Smith making a return appearance. If Smith
and his hurling mates can save the team from
another late-season collapse, the Angel bats may
be enough to push the team to a pennant.

3.) Texas Rangers: Lost in the West shufﬂe, the
Rangers may surprise many fans with an improve-
ment over last season’s 74-70 record. The teams
brings a mix of veterans and young talent back to
the Ballpark in Arlington and is one of the many
teams angling for the almighty Wild Card this
season.

Coming off a lOth—place finish in team home-
runs, the Rangers are looking to veterans Will
Clark and Mickey Tettleton to improve on last
year’s combined 48 four-baggers. Although both
veterans are edging closer to permanent DH
duties, the Rangers, who were without a lO0—RBI
man last season, are hoping that their bats
improve with age.

Ivan Rodriguez, lugging four Gold Gloves with
him into this season, led the squad in hitting last
year with a .302 average. The team’s other
young(er) gun, Juan Gonzalez, managed 27 home-
runs last year —— good enough for second on the
team but far from his numbers in two previous
league-leading seasons.

What will probably keep the Rangers from con-
tention this season will be the pitching staff, with
starters Roger Pavlik (10-10) and Rockie refugee
Tim Rumer (10-8) leading the staff by default.
Kevin Gross and Dennis Cook are from the retire-
ment home and the minor leagues, respectively,

Dieffenbach remains loyal to life and Pitt tennis

 

The Pitt News Thursda A ril 4 1996

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

Four months after George Dieffenbach graduated from
Pitt, he became the Panthers’ tennis coach.

That was in 1975, and Dieffenbach was 22 years old,
only a few months older than some of his players. Twenty
seasons later, he remains at the helm, a constant in the
ever—changing world of college tennis.

Consider this: NCAA tennis coaches stay at one school
an average of 3.5 years. Dieffenbach, 42, has exceeded
the average more than five times over.

Explaining his longevity, Dieffenbach said, “The num-
bers tell it all.” It’s typical Dieffenbach, letting actions -
and records — speak louder than words.

With Dieffenbach courtside, the men’s and women’s
tennis teams have posted a combined record of 312-261.

During those matches, he is a relatively quiet observer,
occasionally shouting encouragement or a suggestion to
one of his players. Yet he sees, and remembers, every lit-
tle hitch.

As a player, Dieffenbach was 32-13, good for 13th on
the all-time win list at Pitt.

Dieffenbach, a member of Shadyside Presbyterian
Church and a Sunday school teacher there, admires those
with a Puritan-like work ethic. He names Bjorn Borg as
his all-time favorite tennis star because, according to him,
Borg was a “quiet fighter.”

Dieffenbach attributes his success to hard work and his
20 years at one school — especially his 20 years at one
school.

“I think it’s critical,’’ he said. “Athletes want somebody
they can relate to, not somebody that’s going to come and
go. Look at coaches who are successful in sports. Look at
Joe Paterno at Penn State. Look at Bobby Knight at

George Dieffenbach started his stint as women's tennis head coach back in 1975. 'l\venty years
later, he's still at Pitt, but he's also teaching Sunday school at Shadyside Presbyterian Church.

Those three, Dieffenbach said, have something in com-
mon: a long history at one school.

Since he started coaching,
Dieffenbach has worked for
three athletic directors. He
and Oval Jaynes have now
worked together almost five
years.

“George is an excellent
teacher,” Jaynes said. “He has

a very good demeanor. [And] »

he has an excellent rapport
with the student-athletes.”

Dieffenbach also teaches
tennis classes at Pitt and
Wildwood Gulf Club in
Allison Park during the sum-
mer.

He met his wife, Emma,
while he was teaching tennis
at a local club, putting a dif-
ferent twist on the tennis term
“love.” Today, the couple has
a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-
year-old son.

Emma can play tennis
well, too. In 1986, the couple
was ranked 13th in mixed
doubles competition in a four-
state region. Later, she served
as the assistant tennis coach at
Pitt, but, when the position
and the men’s team were
eliminated last year, she land-
ed a job as a special education
teacher.

Dieffenbach said that the
most important things in his
life are his religion and his
family. Tennis is a distant
third. Golf is fourth.

In fact, he has organized a
charity golf tournament every
summer for the past few
years. This year, the tourna-
ment will raise money for the
recreation of children and the
elderly in his native
Aspinwall.

How long does he hope to
continue to coach at Pitt?

“Until I retire.”

And after that?

“If I was to go into some-
thing else, it would be golf.”

-From page 8
Chicago White Sox behemoth
first baseman, will break the
single-season home run record
en route to winning the ﬁrst
Triple Crown since Carl
Yastrzemski did it in 1967.
Look for numbers somewhere
in the vicinity of a .355 batting
average, 63 homers and 165
RBI.

7.) Ryne Sandberg, fresh out
of his two-year retirement, will
re-retire halfway through the
year after his much publicized
comeback blows up in his face.
The legendary Chicago Cub
second baseman will finally
realize that he’s actually hurting
the Cubs with his quickly
diminishing hitting skills and
lack of speed. Remember,
Sandberg was barely hitting his
weight before he abruptly
retired. I doubt two years away
from the game will help.

6.) Albert Belle will ﬁnally
kiss the media's butt and still
lose the MVP to Frank
Thomas. Last year, the
Cleveland Indians slugger was
the only player in baseball his-
tory to hit 50 or more homers
and doubles in a (strike-short-
ened) season, but still didn’t
win the MVP because of his
bad relationship with the media.

5.) The Cy Young Award will
officially be changed to the
Greg Maddux Award. Maddux,
the only pitcher to win four
consecutive Cy Youngs, will
win his ﬁfth this year — mak-
inghim the only pitcher to it
win five times.

4.) Cecilio Guante will make
a comeback for the Buccos and
save a horrendous pitching
staff. That’s right, the same
Cecilio Guante who could bare-
ly scratch the Pirates’ pathetic
rotation in the rnid-1980s will
win 15 games this year.
According to unconfirmed
sources, Guante has improved
his velocity and is working on a
splitter.

3.) George Steinbrenner will
fire new Yankee skipper Joe
Torre 40 games into the season
and finally do what he has
always secretively wanted —
name himself manager.

2.) The Pirates will sell out
Three Rivers Stadium one time
this year. It’s a far stretch, but
it's a hunch.

_ 1.) There will be quarter
drafts at the ballpark to lure
more fans, and cellular phones
will be outlawed inside stadi-
ums. No more paying $3.75 for
a 12-ounce beer, and no more
sitting next to that annoying
yuppie who yaps on the phone
while you’re trying to watch the
game. If you see someone
using a cellular during the
game, you’re permitted to beat
him senseless with it.

This season will be the year
baseball goes back to its roots

fat chicken sandwiches) and

The As are looking for a dynamo this
season, with Rickey Henderson off to San
Diego and no outfield replacement in
sight. Manager Art Howe will try to
make due with aging Danny Tartabull and
Geronimo Berroa in left and right and
will be forced to dredge the minors for a
replacement center fielder. Jason
MacDonald, a Class A infield prospect,
may be the long-term replacement for
Henderson’s base-stealing after swiping
70 bases in Class A last year.

Pitching problems make the hitting
problems look mild. Dead last in ERA

team’s only 10-game winner returning.

“We had a little trouble scoop-
ing the ball,’’ said Polecritti. “If
we wouldn’t have played such a
bad team, we might have had
problems out there.”

The team will use the experi-
ence of playing on grass in its

upcoming games against
Wheeling and Grove City
Colleges.

“Grove City will be our next big
test,” said Neff. “That game will
be on grass, so it is good that we
get some experience against some
lesser quality teams on grass
before we play them.”

Pitt plays at Wheeling College
