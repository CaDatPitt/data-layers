Pitt’s for the birds! ‘

At least .that’s what a fam-
ily of sparrows has decided.
After making reconaissance
ﬂights of the area, a mama and
a "papa sparrow decided to
build their love nest in a lo-
cation secluded, yet close to
the business district—above
the Fifth Avenue entrance of
the Cathedral.

Early in o r n i ng students
‘ have been all atwitter at hear-
ing the hidden Warblers and
even more atwitter when they
see them. ' i
' The birds help to prove one
thing—that Pitt is fast beak-
coming an institution of higher-
education in every sense.

Dukes Apologize
For Victory Raid

Duquesne University’s Student '

Council has sent a letter to Pitt

students apologizing for the “un-

fortunate and unsanctioned series
of incidents of Mar. 16;” that is,
the Duke victoryrally.

The letter states__ that “less than
one per cent of our students took
part in the raid . . . We are
shocked that this type of person is
enrolled in our university and are

taking steps to see that this ele-

ment is eliminated.”

The Duke Student Council con-
cluded, saying, “. . . we . . . hope
that you will accept our apologies
and our assurance that this type
of thing will not be allowed to hap-
pen in the future.”

During their‘ post—season rally,
the’ enthusiastic Dukes smashed
wastebaskets at Pitt, overturned
lockers at Tech, and marched
through PCW dorms. ‘

, By BOB “TEMPLE
"Probably. onesgof the most val-

---uable contributions the University

_of Pittsburgh makes to its male
student body is thatyof the ‘dean
of men’s Placement Bureau, head-
ed by Paul M. Sherwood.

It is this agency—run entirely
through the dean of men’s ofﬁce——

_ ' that helps many students acquire
'.part—time jobs to help pay the ex-

penses of their education, or grad-
uate students to get started in their
prospective careers. (This does
not include students in professional
schools who are assisted in , this
matter by t h e i r prospective
Deans)-. The Bureau also aids for-
mer graduates who wish to change
jobs. ‘
Supported .1337 University
The Men’s Placement Bureau,

, which is "completely supported by

the University, was ﬁrst estab-
lished at" Pitt about 1927. In July
of 1952, Mr. Paul Sherwood be-
‘came head of the Bureau, who
says “in the eight months that I
have held the position, I have no-
ticed one fault in general with
’ many of the students.” '

“They don’t seem, as a whole,”
he states, “to become interested in
their post—college ‘work until" it is
almost too late. Many students go’
as‘ far as their junior and senior
years, and still, are uncertain about

Should Consider Early

He believes that students should
begin early to consider seriously
the various possibilities the future
may hold for them.

Engineering and accounting, Mr.
Sherwood says, are two ﬁeldsgthat
are the easiest to get students
started in. .,

_A ﬁeld that is over—sought—
especially by inexperienced people
‘—according to the Bureau director,

is that of personnel work.
“It’s not so bad for people with

: some experience in the ﬁeld,” Mr.

Sherwood explains, “but, since I've

H been here, we’ve been ablevto help

only ﬁve or six beginners to _ac-
quire positions.” —

There is a way, the Bureau di-
rector believes, that certain stu-
dents could help in assisting the
bureau to ﬁnd part-time jobs for.
other students.

“Many students—through the
bureau or their own hook—acquire
positions that help their school
expenses. , When they graduate,
they, of course, quit’ their jobs. If

these vacancies, we could quickly
have them ﬁlled by students who
need such positions toihelp them
through school,” he explains.

‘ No Discrimination

One misconception some people
have concerning the‘ bureau--and
one that Mr. Sherwood asserts is
definitely untrue—is that ‘some
students, of a particular race, re-
ligion,por nationality will not're-
ceive sincere aid fromthe bureau}
“The color" of a person’s skin,”
the director states, “or the church
he attends, or the country his mom
and pop came from have nothing
at all to do with our attempt to
help him. We try our best to help
anyone who has. -the qualities to
ﬁll a position we wish to ﬁll.”

As a result of tremendous gains in the .study for a pos-
sible cure for dread infantile paralysis, better "known as
polio, the entire nation is literally_ on its feet shouting
“Hail to Pitt,” and the echo that is heard is “Hail to Jonas
E. Salk.” '

’ Dr. Salk, head of the virus ‘research laboratory here,
last week‘ announced to the nation‘ that after years of
hard, arduous work a. vaccine has been developed that can
produce effective anti-bodies against all three types of

‘polio. At the time he warned against “over—enthusiasm”

but luckily the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
choose to ignore that statement and was enthusiastic enough
to give the University a “blank check” to be used for polio
research. — ~ 
According to Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Pitt can
have “anymen, any equipment from any place in the world.”
That is the extent of the" Polio Foundaltion’si enthu'siasm.
If we stop to consider the broadness of the Foundation’s
grant, and scope of the Chancellor’s statement we might
possibly feel the relief that mothers and fathers all over
the World are feeling today. Dr. Salk'is their hero and

 .-Pitt is truly a Tower of Learning.

A world free from ugly steel braces is a beautiful pic-
ture, and in the hands of abrilliant, young researcher that
picture is being painted. He is using a “blank check” for
a brush, a-vaccinefor paint,,the world for a, canvas, and
straight, sturdy limbs as a subject. Hail to Jonas Salk.

On another medical battleﬁeld more heartwarming
news has been received. Pitt’s Graduate School of Public

. Health has been granted $24,840. for research in heart dis-

ease by the Life Insurance Medical Research Fund. Dr.
Robert E. Olson, who is in charge of the work, also re-
ceived a grant last monthof more than ﬁve thousand dol-

lars from the American Cancer Society for research in’

C8.I1C€I‘. '

This is the heart of America. Thousands of dollars, ‘-

even unlimited amounts, given for medical research. to help
the unfortunate. And Pitt has been recognized as the
leader. ,

Pitt can be proud of men like Dr. Salk and Dr. Olsen
along with the many people who help untiringly with their
unselﬁsh work. And Pittsburgh can be‘ proud of Pitt.

The Meaning‘ of Academic Freedom—First of a Series

By Gene Weinstein

When people are afraid, their
fear reﬂects itself in their be-
havior. Years ago, fear resulted
in far more crude r-estrictions on
freedom than are practical now.
No longer do the fearful burn
heretics at the stake or give wise
men poison, or 
crucify proph-
ets of a new
social 0 r cl e r.
But it would
be a mistake
to assume that

.th e penalties
for heresy in
the twentieth
century are

   

becausethey are s ripp o  y
sical brutality. The Puritans who

burned the witches, the Greeks '

who gave the hemlock __to Soc-
rates, the Romans and Jews who
cruciﬁed Christ—all were fright-
ened men who saw their values
and beliefs in danger and‘ felt
themselves unable or unwilling
to meet the challenge with rea-
son. -

The forces demanding con-
formity today are, it is true, often
less obvious in their expression
than the inquisitions of the an-
cients; but the result is the same:
a society characterizedby a wor-
ship of the status quo built upon
a framework of fear.

Freedom Suffers

The attributes of one of the
most vital of these liberties, those
embodied ingthe concept of aca-
demic freedom, have suffered
greatly.

When people are afraid, ‘one of
the ﬁrst targets is the educational
system. The people who are
usually most_ afraid are obviously
those who have the most to lose.
These people see their old world
disrupted by new forces, disap-
pear, and slowly become set in a

' new form. Invariably they try, to

halt change with whatever re-
sistance they deem suitable.
A frequent method of counter-

attack through the ages has been -
the effort to standardize thought. '

But last evening I.came upon
Mr. Casey Stengel, an actor in

. his own right, who presides over

a group of players that have been
winning at the box-ofﬁce for the
last four years. These people
are called Yankees. They come
from New York.

Mr. Stengel and his players,

No one talks as much or as
fast as Casey. No one gives as
little information. He? has been
confusing writers, umpires, bar-
tenders, and people for forty

years now. That is because he_

speaks in the future past imper-
fect tense and because" he rambles
continuously.

‘the answers to several questions
I asked him. '

they be the dominant propertied
class, political dogmatists, or re-
ligious absolutists will say that
they believe in academic free-
dom, but this seeming paradox is
easily explained by their perver-
sion of the term. Theylinterpret
academic freedom not as the right
of the teacher to search after
what he conceives to be the truth,
but rather as the duty of the in-
structor to teach his students a
certain point of view.

"Beliefs of the Majority"

Thus the student may learn
only what the indoctrinator
wishes him to know, and, in
many cases, he is not allowed to
even be exposed to contrary
views. These conformists do not
understand that knowledge can

. be divorced from morality. They

have embraced William Buck-
ley’s thesis in “God and Man at

Yale” as their manifesto. Edu--
- cation, they say, must indoctrin-

ate the student with the beliefs
of the majority; The alumnae
who pay‘ bills, says Buckley,
must determine what point of
View is to ‘taught. This view of
the conformists as to the mean-
ing of academic freedom should
not be laughed at, for it is fast
appearing as the dominant pat-
tern in American educational
life. '

As the American Association
of University Professors has
pointed out, academic freedom
can be safeguarded, for
teacher, by such methods as ade-
quate tenure rules. The teacher
as he grows older becomes more
valuable in terms of earning
power. It is only natural’ that he
becomes more wary of incurring
oiﬁcial displeasure, and he is gen-
erally quite aware of exactly who
is oleo-margarining his bread.

College Campuses Docile

A fear-ridden faculty can no
more be expected to ﬁnd the
truth thanya fear—ridden people.

There is no real way, however, ,

similarly to protect the student
who, in a time of public appre-
hension, has reached unpopular
intellectual conclusions. He must
either keep quiet, or pay, as they

Fear Impairs Freedom

say on the radio, the conse-
quences. Unfortunately, nowa-
days too many students scent the
atmosphere, and then remain
quiet. Quietly quiet.

A New York Times study of 72
major colleges reported that “a
subtle creeping paralysis of free-
dom of thought and speech is at-
tacking college campuses . . .
limiting both students and fac-
ulty in the area traditionally re-
served for the free exploration of
knowledge and truth.” This
paralysis, the. Times declared,
has resulted in making many col-
leges “barren of the free give and
take of ideas.”

Attacks on "Subversives"
A year later the Times report-

ed on educational censorship
throughout the land.
Bookburning . . . does not

often occur, but the end re-
sult is 'just as serious when
books charged with being sub-
versive or written by suspect-
ed authors are removed from
school,or library shelves.
Some of the books were thrown
out because they presented ma-
terial favorable to the United
Nations. ‘Others were banned be-
cause pressure groups objected
to passagesthat too accurately
described their own operations.
Bookburning, a common char-
acteristic of such regimes as
facist Germany and communist
Russia, is a strange phenomenum
to experience in ‘democratic
America. The bookburners and
the other censors of ideas are the
spiritual descendents of William
Jennings Bryan and the prosecu-
tion for the state of Tennessee,
who years ago, convicted a young
teacher named Scopes of present-
ing a repugnant heresy, one
which offended the ideas of the
state and local authorities._ ‘
Scopes was guilty of teaching
the facts of evolution. To many
of the conformists, anything to
the left of Joseph McCarthy is
subversive and any favorable dis-
cussion of such theories in the
colleges ranks with Scope’s
heresy. ‘

Oath and its Eﬁect at Pitt).

“He’s a good one. Course,
he got this oh—steo—lotus of the

feet, you know. Fine boy, but

he gets injured easy. Last year
I send Jensen to Washington. I
spend three years with him,
showing him. He’s a football
player, you know. We get this
feller Noren. He’s had four good
years already. Once this feller
gets to «Washington he begin to
hit everything. Noren is nothing
for us. The fellers in the front
oﬂice say“ to me, ‘Casey, look at
centerﬁeld, you have nothing in
centerﬁeld, and then I come up
with Mantle. I train that foot-
ball player three years and the
minute he gets to Washington he
hits everything. And that feller
I give to St. Louis goes good,

' too. You know they don’t keep

Casey as manager just because
they think he’s a ﬁne feller, you
know that, don’t you?”

Take Heed Mr. ‘Pope

Casey paused a moment, then
rolled up his pant leg to display
an -injuryhe received last year
while riding in a taxi. Then he
got up, said goodnight to the bar,
and headed for his bed at the
Schenley Hotel, his success secret
still safe. No one had managed
to discover what he had been
talking about for the past two
hours.

So, _you see, Mr. Pope, you
don’t really have too much of a
problem. Simply take that feller
you used in “Oedipus Rex,” and
them two fellers in “Billy Budd”
and trade them to Tech for that
girl and them two fellers over
there. Then‘ go down to the box-

Switches Creates Lineup Scramble
By RUSS FRANKE. .
Coach Red Dawson wasted no time in trying to ﬁnd
out who’s who in the scrambled personnel situation created
by death of two—plat_oon football by plunging half-a-hundred
hopefuls into-scrimmage right off the bat. -—
Tuesday’s opening drill at Trees Field started off a 20-
day session which, this year, more than ever, will be marked
by experiments at various positions. The search for two-way

players, involving the develop-‘

ment of new talents in the old vets '

plus a close look at the inﬂux of
newcomers, is now combined with
the annual conditioning process.

The most encouraging feature
of the present squad, at ﬁrst
glance, is size. The return of four
regulars scheduled for full-time
duty——Dick' Deitrick, Eldred
Kraemer, Lou Palatella, and Joe
Zombek——and the availability. of
others‘ from a towering reserve
assure the Panthers of an econo-
my-size forward wall.

Sarge Disappointed

After successfully disposing of
the Atlantic Fleet Amphibious
Force in the season lidlifter, the
Panthers nosedived and dropped
two games to Norfolk Naval Base
and one to Fort Eustis.

Sarge was disappointed with his
team’s showing in the South. The
Panthers showed a weakness at
the plate and the defensive play
was shoddy. “They seemed dead
on their feet,” was the only way
Mitterling summed his team’s
showing.

Mitterling went on to say that
errors lost both games to Norfolk,
with the lack of offensive punch
not helping. As for the 16-4 lac-

ing the Panthers suffered at the _ M
