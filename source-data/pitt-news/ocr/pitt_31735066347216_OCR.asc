BAS Chairman Cooper
Hits Governing System

BY BILL MOORE’

Black Action Society '(BAS)
Chairperson Kevin Cooper claimed
the present student governance
system at Pitt has outlived its
usefulness, and called for research
into alternate structures. A

Cooper, and other BAS represen-
tatives, met with Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB)-president Barry
Weisband and SGB member Larry
Gleason Friday at Cooper’s request.

‘‘I’m not blaming anything on
your administration, although I do
not agree with some of the ideals of
the Board members,” Cooper said.
“But _Student Government has
outlived its responsibility to‘ stu-
dents, because we are in a more
diversiﬁed campus now. ’ ’

Weisband, who at ﬁrst threaten-
ed to leave the meeting because a
Pitt News reporter was present, told
Cooper he agreed “a lot of changes
have to be made.”

But the two student leaders
clashed on a» number of points,
including how the changes were to
be-developed, and how necessary
they were. ’

Cooper, who stressed from the
outsetthat it “is not a black and
white situation,” accused the SGB
of mediating disagreements be-
tween students and the administra-

The study, conducted in conjunc-

Health Education'Center will also

last year.

tion, instead of backing the students
wholeheartedly.

Weisband told Cooper that
despite the problems which exist,

"the SGB has adequately represen-

ted the student body.

Cooper proposed that students ,.

interview representatives of organi-
zations on campus to pinpoint
trouble spots and begin work on
restructuring student governance.

Police Strike

Some Signs Up, Others Dovvn

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Some campus police returned
to work yesterday, although the
remainder of the force stayed out
as the strike continues into its
seventh day today.

According to Lieutenant Walter
Waters, 23 man shift patrolled the
University yesterday. Walters said
a 15 man shift normally patrols
when the force is not on strike.

The ‘shift was expanded to
accomodate the return of striking
officers to their posts, Walters
said. '

 
   

The rope broke in the first attempt at :1 Homecoming tug of war

Friday, but the resident students came back on the secondtry to win a

hotly disputed victory over the Greeks.
' Doerfler are shown holding the severed end of the ﬁrst rope.

Walters reported approximately

seventy per cent of the striking‘

ofﬁcers were back on duty by
Sunday evening, after almost a
week on the picket lines.

Strike ofﬁcial Chief Steward
John Forgie denied Water’s
statement, reporting over ﬁfty per
cent of the officers are standing
with the Union. ‘ ‘The. University is
trying every means available to get
our people ‘to stop honoring the
strike,” Forgie said.

“Propaganda was distributed to
the striking ofﬁcers on Friday of
this week containing directions on
howito get out of the Union and
back to work,” Steward Ron Gall
reported. ' '

BY RICH HARRY

The former United States Am-
bassador to Canada pinpointed
overpopulation as a major challenge
facing Americans in the future
during a speech at Pitt yesterday.

Adolph W..Schmidt, a McKees-
po_rt native, cited statistics showing
a 53% jump in 'America’s popula-
tion since 1950, attributed in part to .
increased immigration. “Is it any
wonder there is a growing

v consciousness of the overcrowding

in ‘America?’ ' he said.

Pitt Admissions Options Set Up

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

The University could face a
partial loss of its state funding if it
were to tighten admissions stand-
ards, John Yeager Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Planning and Budget
said at a College of Arts and
Sciences Council meeting Friday.

“Speaking. hypothetically, if the
University were to have 500 less
incoming freshman because of a
tighter admissions policy, it could
lose up to $700,000,” Yeager said.

“The state of Pennsylvania would

give Pitt less money if it were to see A

a tapering off i in student credit
hours ’here."_ i f ._ _ - g
The University has gtheﬁchoice of

"either. becoming ’ more selective  __ .

its admissions policy or maintaining
its present level of enrollment, CAS
Dean Robert Marshall said.-

If the present level of enrollment
is maintained, changes in CAS
curriculum, rules, and distribution
of resources and faculty develop-

ment will become necessary,-

Marshall said.

“The CAS Council could decide
to either maintain or tighten
admissions standards, but not
both” Marshall said.

It would be the job of the Ofﬁce
of Planning and Budget to measure
the impacts of either alternative
Yeager said. ‘ 
' “If the. CAS‘ Council» would

, 'specify._its academic standards, we ,
. could ’mC8Sure .the degree ‘which

istucdentsfﬁe, ?“§iniﬁSs' them “ The" , icyrrriculum

we would send our ﬁndings to the
Provost to figure out what
programs are needed to reach the
standards,” Yeager said.

‘‘I believe this institution can
deﬁne what it wants to do and then
do it. It's a question of where we
are going and what do we want to
be,” Yeager said.

If the University chooses to
maintain enrollment it must market
its creative academic‘ alternatives
to the public in the right way, and
plan more skills programs such as
the writing workshop, Yeager said.

Marshall proposed aprogram for
a smaller more select ‘liberal arts
school and a huge day’ timeversion

have joined the union and elect to

withdraw may do so by notifying 

the union in writing...prior to the

signing or effective date of —a

contract, whichever is later.” ,
Cherry reported the memo had

- been requested by Graham in order A 
to -answer strike questions con- ‘ '

cerning the “maintenance mem-
bership’’ of the Union.

Following a 38 to zero vote” to Y 
reject the Univer_sity’s ﬁnal con- , '

tract proposal on Monday the
Campus Police walked off their
jobs.

For the duration of the strike, the

supervisory staff will be working

twelve hour shifts.

The major’ item of dispute,

between Campus Police and the

___Uni_ve_r_§ity is wages, Forgie report- A  _
ed last Monday night." "At“that‘  

time, Campus Police rejected a

University offer of a 78 cent pay g

raise over a three year period. .

Schmidt spoke to. a"”~large

gathering in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral to commemmorate

the 50th anniversary of -the
University’s Nationality Rooms
Program. .

American ecologists claim thed
U.S. is “well beyond the optimum-

level of population,’ ’ and the access
of natural resources has become
limited," Schmidt said.

“For example, enormous quanti-

ties of water are needed to wash  0
industrial '

away human and
wastes," he said.
Schmidt, who has been activerin
international politics, said overpop-
ulation is not a problem restricted to
the United States, but is world-
wide. “Asia, Africa,

high growth rates. There are also

fewer options available for immi- '
gration than there were for our’ f

great-grandparents and grandpar-
ents. ' ' '

In his speech, Schmidt described - _ , ,
as ‘~

the 19 Nationality Rooms.
“unique in the academic world.’_’
“For all the hard work, sacriﬁce,

and talent put into these rooms, 

especially during the depression __

years of the _thirties, we have 
learned to appreciate the richness of v
the motherlands,” Schmidt said. * 

He also pointed out numerous"
diplomats, royaltyand disting_uish_-
ed persons have visited the r00I.ils

and added, ‘ “The-richness of these»;
rooms have been fsharccdi

Schmidt urged greater attention
by Americans to stabilizing the
population.

“Immigration will be more
important than native births in
determining the future makeup of
the United States, he noted.

Another problem. confronting
Americans in the future, according
to Schmidt, is “resolution of the

conflict between socialist and freegﬂ

enterprise economies.”
Schmidt commended the free

enterprise system practiced in the ‘

United States for “creating wealth
on a scale never known before” and
indicated that socialist economies
are marked by governmental
ownership of the measures used to
produce goods.

- “Individual freedom is foremost
in . creating a free enterprise
system," he said. “I hope the on

coming generations retain the basic 9

principle on which the United States
was built—freedom of the individ
ual." .

Cash Survey, Anyone?

One promise made by Barry Weisband when running for-Student _

Govermnent President, was to have the Board conduct a survey of the
Student Bodyto help determine student priorities and set goals for the
coming year. '

Well, neither the results, not the survey have materialized. The job
was assignedto Board member Robin Wertkin last June. Accordingto
Wertkin, he has had trouble dealing with the administration’s
interpretation of the Buckley Amendment, the student’s right to privacy
act. One wonders if this could bethe only cause for delay.

Surely, the Board is’ not working in the best interests of the students
by allowing the survey to drag on this long. -

One group anticipating the survey results is the Allocations
Committee. They need some of the information to infer where and how
students want their activities fee spent. . '

Allocations should not wait any longer for the results of .Wertkin’s
survey. One cannot guess how much longer the delay will continue.
Instead, Allocations should use another path to gather information, and
should seek what they need to know, not just what Student Government
needs to know.

However, they cannot go out and conduct their own survey, they’ d rim

. into the same red tape concerning the Buckley Amendment. Besides,
__ the  Committee has not been empowered by the Board to
  ' their own surveys.

  Do Not Believe Either Side  

BY PETE BUTCH

The best rule of thumb to follow
when a group goes on strike is:
“Don’t believe anyone.”

Management will exaggerate and
tellgfthe public how deplorably labor
is biting the ‘hand that feeds it.
Labor will turn around and point to
how they are working under cruel
and unusual conditions and starving
their children because of manage-
ment. Don’t believe either side. '

The vocabulary is different,

contradictory. -Labor terms its’

requests “proposals,” manage-
ment “demands." ‘To manage-
ment, the union “demands,” they
“propose.” ' -

Recent reports of the Campus
Police strike ‘point’ to the same
things. Management says 70% of
the-force is not honoring the strike.

. = Why not say that? Management
« wants those striking to feel they are
' in a minority, hoping they will rush

back to their jobs, work under any

i conditions, just so they still have a

job. A

Labor- Says 50% of the force are
not honoring the strike. Of course
they would say that. They can't let
their men feel they are a minority or
else they’ll respond the way
management wants them to, and
end the strike.

More often than not labor will

"charge management with a rule

violation or vice versa. Before this

' rumor can be quelled, the damage

will have been done, and this

. violation,_ which did not occur, will

be on tip of everyone’s tongue.
. A source in ' management is
alleging that recent accounts of

g * vandalism; such asdamagedone to
, H‘ emergency.‘ phones, and V tires:
. '  I‘   ‘onuniversity ‘vehicles;  .j:..
L  .Bitt%...the':. 

statement causes one to wonder,
did these acts really occur? And did
labor commit them to harass
management? Or did management

do it to blackball labor, to give them i

a bad image? Was it a ploy to erode

' public sympathy? No one will know

unless the vandal is apprehended.
No group should be pre-judged.

It is ironic, but typical, that labor
ﬁnds sympathizers in those with
blue collar upbringing, and man-
agement in those with white collar
lifestyles. Peoples’ emotions and
prejudices do not cross class lines.
There are those who will not even
listen to the problems of manage-
ment. Others won't hear about

what labor believes to be their right.
The ideal is to listen to both sides,
" and ‘remember that both factions
have much at stake. But this is very
hard to do if you feel sorry for
someone freezing on a picket line,‘

 

 Edginess Felt Last Tuesday  

BY TOM WASELESKI

~ Editor’s note: This is the
conclusion of Tom Waseleski’s
Impressions gathered in the
Terrace Room of the William Penn
Hotel with fellow Democrats las
Tuesday night. ‘ ‘

You couldn’t mistake the edgi-
ness. _

Despite the Schmidt’s, the cheap
sandwiches andthe re-lit cigars, the
Democrats faced another kind of
hunger, and it‘didn’t look as if they
were going to be fed too soon.

There was hell to be paid, and the
Carter people sitting on edge all
night wanted nothing more than to
pay it. The Heinz contingent on the

seventeenth ﬂoor, following the .

not collecting any pay. Or if you are
irate because you can't get a candy
bar or can of cola anywhere on
campus. ‘ A

Unions honoring other union’s‘

picket lines is a way of assisting
those on strike. For the strike is felt
more if other essential services are
missing. This is a‘ move to bring
management back to the bargaining
table quickly.

' But it can soon turn into a siege,

with management still refusing to .

talk to strikers and students caught
in themiddle. Management does
not get its cola from a vending
machine.

A month from now, maybe less
this will all be Pitt history. Some
will be branded heroes, others
villains. The best an observer can

do is not to. fall for such ’

generalizations, and keep a rational
bead. . ' '

same tight margin on TV, sat
nonetheless gingerly, sipping cock-
tails and rejecting the beer for the
most part, like some overflow

ballroom crowd at the Waldorf- .

Astoria on New Year’s Eve.-
After all, the Republicans had

won tight iones before, why get’

worked up over a Georgia peanut
farmer? The country band played

almost in self-mockery of the GOP’ s ‘

regional preference tonight.

After tonight they could very well
call it routine. Three straight
presidential elections! And won by
a party only 29 percent of the

population identiﬁed with. A Ford
victory would bury Watergate and '

invite those tainted with scandal not
only back into the party, but most
certainly back into the government.

Insanity, thought the Democrats
downstairs in the stiﬂing. Terrace

Room. Ifwhatithe Heinz gang had .

was a country band, i -then the
Democrats’ entertainment could

safely be called hillbilly. The Sands ,

Sisters and the Original Dixie
Country Cousins, the same sequin-

tied, big mama-ed group that’

played‘ the Pittsburgh end of the
Carter whistlestop. They twanged a

fair‘ “Happy Days Are Here"

Again,” the unofﬁcial Democratic
anthem, and suddenly there was not

a Republican to be feared. Until

about half an hour later.
It . was around -11:30 when

.Cronkite showed Carter with 208
, electoral votes to Ford's 72. Beer"

was spilled and there was no love

lost between the partiers in this .v
. room and the incumbent about to" be

thrown out.

Yet at the Witching hour of

midnight, Bill Green appeared on
the TV screens unexpectedly, and it
took a few angry threats to shut up
the Sands Sisters. Their male-lead
was struggling through a Johnny
Cash imitation of “Folsom Prison
Blues.” _

Green was conceding to Heinz in
one of the most deplorable ad libs of
political history. If anyone should
decide to catalogue the address, I
offer the title, “25 Different. Ways
to Say, ‘It Appears at This Time
That We Have Lost the Election. ’ ’ ’

It was suddenly like a large
viewing room in a mausoleum. The
Democrats had eyes riveted to the
deceased, and there was only ‘sad,
subdued, idle talk.

Yet there were no tears. Not one
among the Schmidt’s and empty
peanut shells.

' Upstairs, Heinz A was anxious
enough to step before the cameras.
The view from the balcony "behind
and above him was sobering. In a

choice of choreography.

In a‘ minute one of the young
women returns from the lobby with
a sign, made from a felt tip pen, that
she thrusts on top of one of the TV’s.
“Jerry, clean out your desk, ” it
says amid the wild cheers, as she
raises a fist to the crowd and snarlsn.

And they wanted to occupy that‘?

desk so ‘bad they could smell its

At around .1 a.m. Cronkite’s big
board showed them a mere 3

the Democrats came as close to
pandemonium as they would get
that night.‘ Keep in mind this was

’ BYIMATTHEW KENNEDY

“Good friend, for Jesus’ sake
forbear, to dig the dustinterred

_ here

«God bless he who spares these

.  stones, and cursed be he who moves

my bones."

From the tomb of W. Shakespeare.
/

That worn inscription ‘over the
last mortal remains of the Bard were
potent enough to scare off a nation
of Puritan vandals and generation
upon generation of theatre depart-
ment. It’s easy to imagine this

 warning covers literary as well as
skeletal remains, and the doom of

those brave enough to reinterpret
the works of Shakespeare is made of

disappointed Elizabethan fanatics,

and enraged Hamlet junkies.

The Pitt Theatre Department’s
production and reinterpretation of
the Merchant of Venice, this

seasons’ second Mafnstage Pro-E

duction, was an act of courage and
the criticism from‘ the classical
corners will be well-deserved

‘-though hardly relevant.

First and foremost is the stunning
stage design by Henry Heymann. It

breathes elegance and taste, just on

the sunny side of decadence, in

"perfect harmony with the frilly,

jet-set antics of the Venetian crowd
on stage.

Lacking the thrust-stage which
enabled actors in Shakespeare's
time to penetrate the ranks of the

-audience, Heyma_nn’s carefully

metered platforms descend towards

"carry

ierchant': Act  Courage

the audience, generating an illusion
of closeness, more than adequate
for the asides and other close-con-
tact engagements between the
viewers and the actors. Rooms and
landscapes drop, slide and swing
into place with a coordination and
ingenuity making scene changes a
vital part of the motion on stage.

The actors move freely on this
set, an excellent mechanism for the
theatre. Heymann preserves the
flexibility of the naked stage yet
realizes the mechanics of stage
design to trap the audience in the
bubble of a play.

William Wendt as the nefarious
genius Shylock and Kate Young as
the much-pursued heiress Portia
are as good as must be expected

considering their professional ex-'

perience. Their acting creates a
centerpiece to the relative inexper-
ience of the rest of the cast. The
energy of Wendt and Young’s
performance conspires with the
high-speed velocity of action to
the audience from one
moment to the next.

The other protrayals from the
stricken merchant Antonio by Ken
(Jargaro to the bombastic Renaiss-
ance jock Gratiano by Bernard

McKenna'iIl range from subdued -«

and strained to invigorating. This is
again expected. _

The demands of the play and
fielding a large cast obviously
stressed the department's reservoir
of polished talent.

What seems to have been traded

. off, and this will enrage the ranks of

Shakespeare aficionados most
thoroughly, is the imagery and
language of the play in return for
commitment to basic portrayal.
Outside the incandescent spheres of
Young and Wendt, the stimulating,
suggestive and evocative words are
buried under the action, the tension
and the delightful turns of plot’. .

To take issue with the-stillbirth of
so many promised poetries is
absurd from the stance of the total
production. It works. What
imagery fails to illuminate, the
brilliant stage design creates; what
the "cast may lack in polish Wendt
and ‘Young infuse; what the
interpretation suggests, the sheer
moinentum of the action vitalizes.

Director Richard Mennen has
obviously taken close stock of his
resources, and the ﬁnal display
reveals an excellent play, with
compromises balancing achieve-
ments in a diplomatic feat worthy of
Kissinger. The tight-rope walk

A ends in victory for the production

and for the delighted audience.

The use of a Victorian theme for
costuming and stage design blends
well with the rest of the play.
Shakespeare’s times were obsessed
with the requirements of order,
cosmic as well as social: Class lines
provided a concrete barrier for
people, and Elizabethan audiences
were entranced with a play whose
characters struggle in’ their social
worlds to burst indivisible, yet
powerful territorial boundaries.

Clumsy Animals Tramp

Into Ballet's Cinderella

BY LEAH McFA_RLAND

The Saturday night performance
of Cinderella by the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre is an unforgettable
tribute to the hospitality and
resourcefulness of the ballet
company in this city.

The Barnum and Bailey Ringling
Brothers Circus was in town for the
weekend. The main contingent

found the Civic Arena and,’

presumably, put on a wonderful
show. It seems, however, that
several members of the animal acts
got lost and ended up at Heinz Hall.

Not to be inhospitable, the Ballet
Theatre found room and roles for
these poor lost animals in Saturday

-night’s performance of Cinderella.

Sure, there were some technical
problems. Actually, the only
animals extant in the fairy tale of
Cinderella are the birds that help
the poor wench pick up the spilled
peas and lentils, the horses that pull
her magic coach and, later, a few
piddling mice.

Lesser talents rriight have balked
at an indiscriminate reorganization
of the animals in the ‘ballet. Not so
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. With
indescribable zest, Nicolas Petrov
choreographed and the team of
Frano Jelincic and Kenneth John-
son staged the antics of the Barnum
and Bailey performers. ' ‘

First, the group dressed as
_ping-pong-ball-headed polar bears.
it was no trick‘ to write them into-the
“winter fairies” scene. All- they
had to do was lumber’ back and forth
in a rather" furry elephant walk.
And, to really_enhance the magical
mood of Cinderella,’ the Fairy
Godmother wields a battery-opera-
ted glowing magic wand. ’ Why try
‘to capture the magic through a
well-placed spot? It’s special
effects time at" 1-leinz Hall.

One group of the mis-directed
Barnum and Bailey performers
nearly had Petrov and Company
stumped. What to do with the
midgets? Not just your average,
run-of-the-mill midget, either.
These were hairy little buzzards,
looking a bit like deformed
leprechauns or lascivious munsch-
kins. Then, inspiration struck.

“We’lljust have them run around
the stage in a disorderly fashion,
holding the numberals of a
clock—one each. And, since we at
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre have
proved ourselves such wizards with
multi-media special effects in the
past, we’ll make a movie of the little
urchins and show it on a screen on
the backdrop,” they might have

said.

No sooner said than done. The '

midgets were ushered on stage and
did a magniﬁcent job of holding
their numerals at a slant calculated
not to catch the light. And bless that
big-hearted, upper-crust Pitts-
burgh audience. Realizing that the

, poor little tykes were part of‘

Barnum and Bailey’s ensemble,

they laughed and cheered wildly, 

approving the taste and generosity
-which has spurred the, Ballet

Theatre to adapt Cinderella in such ,

a novel fashion. ‘

“If at first you don’t succeed, try,

try agin." It’s a noble motto, and ,

one the Ballet Theatre has taken to
heart.‘ Not having been totally
successful in demonstrating how far

‘one must ‘sink to please a

Pittsburgh audience through the
use of the’ midget screen test, they
went on to try valiantly once more in
the first act. No; Cinderella’s coach

was not pulled by two guys sharing '

a horse costume. She traveled in
style—four poor saps dressed in
reindeer horns pulled the coach.

Ever ride a stickhorse during your
formative years? If so, you have the
reindeer dance down—letter per-

fect. .

Suddenly appalled by the notion

_ that they might be missing some of

the cultural tastes which give
money to the Ballet Theatre on a
regular basis, the group changed
tack in Act Il. For reasons

~ unexplained to the audience, ‘a

number of what looked like walkin g
pumpkins crashed Prince Charm-
ing's ball. Maybe the culturally
astute got it—it’s doubtful. The

' dancing gate-Crashers were [pre-
sumably illustrating Sergei Proko- .

fiev‘s opera, “For Love of Three
-Oranges.” They weren’t walking
pumpkins after all. So much for the
Thanksgiving spirit.

Actually, Prince Cnarming’s ball
was a lot more diverting than one
could have hoped for. Not content
with the ambiguous oranges, the
Ballet Theatre introduced.the Court

Pennsylvania or West Virginia and

“Run To Pitt”

BY BETSY NORMAN

The plight of autistic children and
the anguish the disease can cause
their families is virtually unknown.
Alpha Phi Omega (APO), a national
service fraternity, plans to bring the
problem into focus by making
autistic children the beneﬁciaries of
this year’s “Run to Pitt.”

The “run” will begin at 9 a.m.
this _Friday when West Virginia
University’s» head "football coach
Frank Cignetti will hand last year’s
WVU-Pitt game ball to members of
the WVU chapter of APO. The ball
will be run relay-style through West
Virginia to Pitt Stadium, where, on
Saturday, it will be accepted by
Pitt’s head coach Johnny Majors
just prior to the kickoff of the
Pitt-WUV football game.

The purposes of this year’s
‘run" are to raise money for the
National Society for Autistic
Children (NSAC) and ‘to create
public awareness of the disease.
The money will be split equally
between ‘equipment, such as a
projector for NSAC’s chapter in

workshop training by specialists for
colleges, universities, centers and
schools in Pennsylvania and West
Virginia. Money also will be given
to support research projects into
causes, treatments and education of
autistic children.

Autism is a ‘mystery disease

‘which affects four of every 10,000

children. It is a reaction to a severe
brain disorder which usually shows
up before the age of 2% . Since the
cause of the disease is still
unknown, autism can be identiﬁed

tance to change. But despite their

in the Pittsburgh Press this past
summer. He then obtained the

0 support of his fraternity and then

that of Pitt’s chapter of APO, to

Since then, both schools have been

red tape in the sports department
for us," Walsh said.

“NSAC really needs our help. It

is not the type of organization that '

Panthers Roll Over Army  
  As Purdue Nips Michigan

' BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

“We're number one, we’re
n'umber‘one,” chanted the jubiant
student section at Pitt Stadium
Saturday while the Panthers were
handily defeating Army by a score
of 37-7. And fresh in the students
minds was the announcement that
previously number-one ranked
Michigan had been upset moments
early, 16-14, by a _Purdue team
which has become known through
the years for coming up with the
big wins. '
' The

result--the Panthers

4 SHOULD become the .nation’s top

ranked team, but it won’t ofﬁcially
be known until the polls come out

later today. If the AP (writers and ’
broadcasters) and UP] (coaches) ,

DOIIS have any validity at all, then
the dream of a team, 1-10 only four
short‘ years ‘ago, will have come
true-

' For the ﬁrst time all season, Pitt
coach Johnny Majors spoke willing-
ly about the rankings, especially
the one at the very top.

“Well, I’m not going to turn it
down,” he said, smiling. “I think
we have as much right to that as
anybody right now. We have more
of a claim to it than anybody right
now, but we’ve got to prove it week
after week. _

“It’s something we’ve worked
very hard to accomplish,” he
continued, “and something we’re
proud to have right now and that
we’ve earned and I don't think
somebody can sit on. We can’t
boast about 'it.” v

The Panthers are now 9-0 wit
two more games to_ play, plus a
bowl game, so Majors hasn’t yet
tied a knot around the top spot.

“We've got to scratch and claw:

‘bite, block and tackle—whatever it
'is—to keep our standing. With

West Virginia coming up and Penn
State, we’ll have to be very tough.”
And the Panthers were tough on

Reserve fullback Thom Sindewald digs for yardage in Pitt’s 37-7 win
over Army, which vaulted the Panthers to a possible top ranking, thanks
to the Purdue upset over Michigan. Sindewald rushed for 64 yards in ten

carries.

Sports   

Saturday, both on‘ offense and
defense, against the best Army

’ contingentin several years, led by

the passing of junior quarterback
Leamon Hall, whose 27-yard pass
to Mike Castelli in the middle of the
third quarter broke the shutout bid.

But by then, Pitt was “psych-
ed,” having just heard the
announcement that Purdue was
leading Michigan, 13-7, at the half
on the Boilermakers’ home turf in
West Lafayetteville, Indiana. Early
in the’ third‘ quarter, Michigan
quarterback Rick Leach tossed a

65-yard touchdown pass to Jim.

Smith and the conversion gave the
Wolverines a narrow 14-13 margin.
After Purduerrecovered a Mich-
igan fumble by Ron Lytle, the 3-5
Biolermakers drove downﬁeld, but
had to settle for a 23-yard ﬁeld goal
by Rick Supan-with only 4:20 to
play. Then Michigan drove back to
the Purdue 19 where they were
forced to try a ﬁeld goal attempt‘
from 37 yards out. The kick by Bob

Wood was no good with only 14 '

seconds to go. -

‘ Still, _the Panthers had their own
job to do against Army and were
well on their way to success by the
time the ﬁnal from Purdue reached
their ears and those of the 45,753
homecoming fans who braved" the

40 degree temperature to witness

Tony Dorsett and crew. V
Dorsett had his usual spectacular
day, romping for'212 yards on 33
(there’s that number again) carries
and threetouchdowns. Not only
did he set a new record for career
all-purpose running _(breaking ano-
ther mark of Archie Grifﬁn’s') but

"he also reached the 1,500-yard
‘plateau rushing for an unpreced-i

ented third season. Dorsett now
holds ten NCAA records.

The game also sawthe return of
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh who
broke a bone in his ankle against
Louisville, four weeks ago. With
Tom Yewcic, who may go down in
the books as one of the fevy
undefeated college quarterbacks,
starting, Pitt managed only 3-0 ﬁrst
quarter lead on a 27-yard ﬁeld goal

Players Awaiting Polls

BY RON SIEGEL

When Matt Cavanaugh came off
-the ﬁeld Saturday afternoon in the
fourth quarter, Pitt Stadium

erupted with the biggest ovation of .

the season. Despite his ﬁne
‘performance on his return from
a broken ﬁbula, not all of the
cheering was for Cavanaugh.
. The cheering was because it had
' just been announced that Michigan
hadbeen upset by Purdue, and that
made Pitt the number one team in
college football.
Rated second by both wire
- services and The Sporting News
, going into Saturday’s action, Pitt
will surely move up to first when
this week's results are announced
today or tomorrow.

"going to beat Michigan,” said
: ‘Cavanaugh, who returned to action
after missing three games. ‘‘I

bowl game.” ‘ '

Ev Cavanaugh would n<}t1"..:.riopen1y .

   
 

declare Pitt the best team in the
nation. “Pitt's the best team that
I've seen," he hedged. E '

Tony‘ Dorsett, who eclipsed
Archie Griffin's all-purpose run-
ning record of 6,003 yards, was

more certain. “I've been. thinking -

that all year, ’ '7 he said. ‘ ‘That’s one
of the goals we set four years ago.”

Asked if he would rather rush for
2,000 yards in one season, or 6,000‘
in his career, Dorsett countered,
‘‘I'd_ rather win a national
‘championship. . .

“lf 1 get 6,000 yards,-that's all
ﬁne and well, but if not, there won’t
be any hard feelings. l’ve reached
most of my individual goals. What-
ever I do now is just gravy, icing on
the cake.”

Defensiive end ‘Cecil Johnson,

citing Pitt's extensive depth, said '

“I'm gonna stick with the home
team” when asked to pick the top
club. -

game despite a bad leg, ‘agreed with it '

Pelusi said he deﬁnitely has a
-‘preference for what bowl game he
wants to play in, and he’s going" to
get his wish. “I want to play in‘ the
Pitt Bowl,” he said. “Next

West Wgi;ginia.”
That ind of talk is music to

Major’s ears. He doesn't want his-

Panthers worrying about bowl
games when two teams that beat
them last year remain "on -the

Majors, who casts a ballot in the
UPI poll, was asked who he was
going to voteifor this week. ‘ ‘I think

he grinned. '

Cavanaugh Returns To
Spark Panthers, 37-7   

BY KAREN KADILAK A

A ‘_‘Welcome back, Matt.”

Pitt head coach Johnny Majors
said it outright during the course of
his post-game radio show Saturday
afternoon. The crowd of 45,753 on
hand to watch the Panthers blitz
Army 37-7. said it indirectly when it
twice showered recently injured
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh with
a hearty round of applause--app-
lause so loud that it surely must

have shaken archaic Pitt Stadium.

off its foundation for a splitjsecond.

' Outright or indirectly, either way
it made Cavanaugh, who returned
to the Panthers’ offensive line-up
Saturday following a month’s
inactivity due to a cracked ankle
bone, feel welcome.

“It was great, simply great,” the
junior, signal-caller said by his

dressing stall in a quiet Pitt locker -
room. “To know that vou’re_that 4

welcomed, that admired, it sure has

to make you feel good. Great is _

more like it.”

Indeed it was nice that Cavan-
augh thought so fondly of the
welcome extended him. However,
all Majors and- Saturday's Pitt
Stadium crowd wanted to do ‘by
giving Cavanaugh such a warm
welcome was to repay the
compliment, for “great” could also
describe his performance.

Although yardage-wise he deﬁn-

.itely wasn’t up to par (he

completed eight of 12 tosses for 67
yards), spiritually his return was
devastating, or sofelt quarterback
and receiver ‘coach Bobby Cox. I-
‘‘Not taking anything away from

, .

the victorious scene just outside of
the‘ Panthers’ loc-ker room,
“there’s still nothing like having
your ﬁrst-string quarterback in
there. .

‘‘lt’s.good to see Matt back for‘
that reason,” Cox continued.
"Today, he gave us that spark that
got us going. llm awfully
pleased." -

Evidentlyv ho was Majors.

“What a great job he ‘did,”
Majors said in reference to his
returning quarteback.“He’s one of
the ﬁnest quarterbacks, if not THE
ﬁnest, in the country." '

Not such a far-fetched observe-
ation at all--at"least, not in view of
the strong-armed quarterback’s
showing Saturday. ‘

The good quarterback can be an
instrumental part of nearly- any
. team’s offense whether he has 300
yards passing 'or not. Even 200
yards, forithat matter. It’s the little
things that count, especially in
Pitt's veer offense.

- Big yardage passing days aren’t

essential  long as the Panthers‘
can get their high-powered running _

attack working. Getting the timing
down on pitch-outs to Dorsett,
mixing in a bit of fullback, smashes
off the tackles, or even keeping on
the quarterback option--those are
the keys to making the veer work at
Pitt. Just as long as there’s a little
passing to keep the defense-honest. -

.That’s exactly what Cavanaugh
did on Saturday. From the time

V (2:49. mark of the first quarter) he

came in to thunderous applause to
the time he;left (8:02 remaining. in
the ' contest‘),

ideas of the Cadets scoring in the
ﬁrst half.

The third quarter saw 28 points
'put on the board--21 by the
Panthers and Hall’s TD pass to
Castelli. Dorsett’s ﬁrst carry of the
half for ten yards put him over the

"popped loose.

100-yard mark for the 31st time in
his career (twice more and he will
tie Griffin’s record 33). Seven
plays later, Dorsett took a pitch
from Cavanaugh to the left and
outran the Army defense down the
sideline, just making it inside the
pylon for‘ a TD with 12:11 left in the
third quarter and to give Pitt at
20-0 lead.

Only three minutes later, Dorsett
eased to another touchdown from.
five yards out, after Cavanaugh

raced 49 yards‘ down the right side —

on a keeper off the option.

After Army's TD completion
madelthe score 27-7, the Panthers
oegan a drive at their own 29 and
capped it ‘when Cavanaugh dump-
ed a pass to ﬂanker Willie Taylor,
‘cutting across the middle, who split
the Army secondary and ran 24
yards for a TD with 3:38 to go in the
third period.

George 0’Korn got the ball back
for Pitt on the ensuing kickoff by
recovering a fumble at the Army 38
after Scott McKeel hit Army's
Devon Maness so hard that the ball .
However, the
Cadets regained possession when
Dorsett fumbled a Cavanaugh pitch

- two plays later and"‘Army’s Ray

Beverly fell on the ball.

The fourth quarter settled down
considerably (except for- the
stands), but the Panthers, with
freshman Woody Jackson at

quarterback, added another ﬁeld
goal by Long, this one a 35-yarder
to raise their margin to 37-7.

“I don't know where to put the
praise except on everybody,” said
a delighted coach Majors. “It was
as ﬁne a team victory as.we could
have. This was a great example of
a team winning--in all phases."

And it was also another chapter
in the continuing success story of
Tony Dorsett, who now has 1,525
yards for the season, 5,659 for his
career, and surely, a lot of Heisman
Trophy votes.

“What else can you say about
Dorsett," Majors pondered.
“Amazing, what he’s done. Tony
had a few bruises today too. (He
left the game early in the fourth.
quarter due to a bruised elbow and
thigh.) He has that courage to play
when he’s aching.

“He came through in good
shape--better than he did last
week. Ithink he’s in good shape.
We didn’t want to put him back in

there after he limped off, because
the game was in good shape.”

  Harris Draws Complaint

A Tower B resident assistant has
filed a complaint with Oakland
magistrate Nicholas Diulus against
Pitt basketball player Larry Harris
after the 6-6, 205 lb. junior forward

-reportedly assaulted the RA in a

Tower B elevator last Sunday
afternoon. '
According to police and eyewit-
ness reports, Harris was the last
person to board the elevator which
began buzzing and would not move
with the excess of weight. After
several people had spoken up to

Harris, the RA requested he get off.
Harris allegedly punched the RA in
the eye, causing the victim’s
glasses to break and opening a cut
which required five stitches. It was
also learned last evening that the
victim, who claims to have eight
witnesses, has a broken bone in his
upper cheek and may require.
surgery to repair’ the damage.

The victim, Who was directed by ‘

his attorney to remain silent, said
only that he will not drop the
complaint.

roan VACATIONS IN PALM
~ 1 » SPRINGS

PALM SPRINGS, Calif (AP)-
President Ford arrived at this desert
resort Sunday for a vacation stay
and immediately plunged into an
old routine 8 shaking hands with
welcomers.

Upon emerging from Air Force
One with -members of his family,
Ford immediately headed toward a
music3making high-school band
and a group of football lettermen
holding a yellow-and-black banner
that read, “A sunny welcome to
Palm Springs, President Ford.”

The Ford family plans an
eight-day post-election vacation
with emphasis on golf, rest and
recreation.

U.S. ATTORNEY MARSTON WILL
NOT STEP DOWN

PHILADEPHIA (AP)—;_U.S.
Atty. David Marston, a Republican
appointee, has decided to break
with tradition and refuse to resign
under the administration of Demo-
crat Jimmy Carter.

“I don’t think there’s been a
protocol since Watergateﬂ’ said
Marston. “I think it’s a different

ball game. I think all the rules have ,

changed.” ‘

Historically,‘ a change in the
White House means a wholesale
turnover in the 94 U.S. attornéy’s
office around the country.

In-HouseDirecfory

To Bte»A\/ailablye at Pitt:

 An In-House Directory listing
phone numbers and addresses of
Pitt students will be published in

lieu of the Student Directory that _g

was made available to the
University community in past years.

Students will have the option to
remove their names from publica-
tion in the directory.

The In-House Directory will be
available for use only in a few
administrative offices, according to
Alden Bowen, coordinator of the
‘campus judicial system.

"The data base from which s.uch a .

directory is prepared is less than
50°/o accurate," Bowen said.

‘-‘Also the time necessary to
obtain the correct information
would mean that such a directory
would not be published and made
available to the University commun-
ity before January, l977," Bowen
said. .

Bowen, however, indicated there
is a need for an In-House Directory
to be compiled by the Office of
Student Activities. A

"Offices periodically need infor-
mation regarding students for

release to agencies, organizations-, _

the media and individuals who

7:7‘?

‘l

1%.

7%,

demonstrate legitimate purpose in
their inquiries about students,-"
Bowen said. '

In order for these offices to obtain

‘this information for appropriate

release, the University, according
to _the “Privacy Rights of Parents
and Students” more commonly
known as the “Buckley Amend

ment, must afford parents and
students the opportunity to remove
their names and information about
them from the In-House Directory,
Bowen explained.

Bowen said he hopes few
students will exercise this right
because the types of releases made
by the offices having access to the
In-House Directory generally bene-
ﬁt the student. I

Releases of this information, for.

example, are made to legislators,
groups conducting surveys, lending
institutions and newspapers, as
well as friends and relatives. ‘

Bowen said releases will not be
made to advertisers, insurance
companies and other groups that
might engage in some form of
solicitation.

Individuals who wish to remove
their personal information from the
directory should ﬁll out the adjacent
form and return it to Room 105
Schenley Hall by Nov. 12.
