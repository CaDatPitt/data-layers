One of the peregrine falcons born
atop the Cathedral of  this
year diedlastweekwhenhe ﬂewinto a
Window and broke his neck.

“Birds stnldngwindows is the single
largest] cause [of their] mortality in
North America,” said National Aviary
spokesman Todd Katzner “He was
young and dumb and hadn’t ﬁgured
things out, and he paid for it clearly.”

Katzner speculated that the falcon,
born April 30, saw his reflection in the
Rand Building window before colliding
with it just before noon last Tuesday.

Katzner said that researchers are
working to make cities ‘safer for birds
by developing a  coating for
windows so that birds Won’t see their
reﬂections He said that the small
silhouettes some people putinwindows
don’t really scare birds

Kate St. John, creator of the bird-
watching blog, “Outside My Window,”
and volunteer overseer of the falcons
since 2001, ran to see the falcon from
her woriqolace at WQED and arrived

. within minutes of the accident

“The Pennsylvania Game
Commission allowed me to bury him
but in an unmarked‘ grave somewhere

On her blog, St. John said that the falcon,
posthumously named “Sky” by a woman who
commented on the blog entry about his death,
was still warm when she arrived, but Sky did not
die alone

“Ithinkoneof tl1eotl1erclr1icl<swasti1eretosee

 Sky did not have a name because birds
are not named in Pennsylvania to prevent people
from  of them as pets However, Katzner
explained that sometimes these birds reach a sort
of “celebrity status,” and  them makes
talking about them easier

Despite this accident, Katzner said that man-
made urban nests for peregrine falcons have been
successful. He said that there are fewer falcon
predators like great horned owls in cities, and
falcons habitually take over pre—existing nests

“One unique  about falcons is they don’t
build their own nests They either steal the nests of
other birds, or they scrape depressions into cliff
sides,’ ’ said Katzner

There are ﬁve or six falcon nests on buildings
and bridges in Pitisbutgh, including the one on the
Gulf Tower Downtown, said Katzner.

St John said that these nests helped to remove
the peregrine falcon from the national endangered
species list in 1999, but the falcon population hasn’t
rebounded completely in Pennsylvania.

_ “In the ’70s, peregrine falcons went extinct
everywhere east of the Mississippi [River].

A comprehensive approach

5 Sex-ed should be diversiﬁed to be effective i

Every year, millions of fed-
 eral dollars are allocated to fund
 abstinence-only education pro-
 grams across the United States.
 But during the last two years,

skepticism toward these pro-
 grams has prompted several
. states to decline the grants.

Emily Hajek, policy adviser to
3 Iowa Gov. Chet Culver, told the
: Associated Press that Iowa’s de-

cision to leave the program was

because, “It was just too strict ...
f We believe local providers have

the knowledge to teach what’s
1 going to  help those young
 people be safe.”
‘ As it stands, only 28 states
V including Pennsylvania adhere
A to the program, which was cre-
_ ated in 1996 as a part of welfare
 reform. Criticizing inconsistent
i funding and a lack of proof
about the program’s effective-
ness, the other 22 states have
refused abstinence education
: funding altogether or are plan-
: ning to do so soon.
V Admittedly, there are prob-
’ lems with abstinence-only edu-
E cation. Many critics feel that
it doesn’t present an accurate
worldview because of the lack
of information on safe-sex prac-
tices or that it simply doesn’t
 prevent teens from having sex.
I Data exists to support both ar-
guments, only making matters
more difficult.

However, they don’t neces-
sarily have to be. The teachings
of abstinence education are not
incompatible with a compre-
hensive sex—ed approach. Ab-
: stinence-only programs do give
 teens some effective information
and can’t be discounted out of
 hand.

 Thus, the most obvious solu-
: tion would be to allow schools
A to receive the funding from the
programs without limiting their
j options to teaching just one or
5 the other.
: Under current laws, Title V
 programs — those that receive
 abstinence education fund-

ing - prohibit states receiving
funding from the program from
discussing contraceptives or safe
sex, except to emphasize failure
rates.

Obviously, though, this
doesn’t address the whole prob-

lem. Schools should be allowed 5
to use money as they see fit. 
If they choose to run an absti- i
nence—only program, they could, 
but they could also offer a com- 
prehensive program tailored to i

the community.

This way, the federal govern- j

ment wouldn’t be giving univer— ;
sal mandates across the board ‘

I Ruling protects individuals’ rights

and forcing states to either go
100 percent in or 100 percent
out.

In a perfect world, the schools
would be able to craft their own
programs based on the sur-

1

rounding area while being free i
from pressures from religious or 
_social groups trying to promote '

one style of education over the
other. A

In reality, schools obviously
have to be responsive to the
community as a whole, but it
would still be better for schools
to offer tailored programs — or
perhaps even several classes de-
pending on student preference
— rather than have to comply
with strict federal regulations
just so they can afford to offer
sexual education at all.

Instead, though, these grants
allow politicians to dictate what
students will learn and how they
will learn it. Though Pennsylva-
nia’s acceptance of the grants
can’t be condemned, since the
programs at least have the po-

p tential to work as well as com-

prehensive education.

I

But it can be said that the best 

approach would be to work to— 3
ward a future where these con- I

l

siderations didn’t have to be con- 

sidered at all, and instead schools
and communities were allowed
to use available funding to the
best of their ability to educate
children as best they can.

The Supreme Court affirmed
the right of the individual citi-
; zen to keep and bear arms for

personal defense Thursday when
it overturned the D.C. handgun
ban.

The case was decided by a 5-4
vote, with the majority opinion
written by Justice Antonin Scalia,
who said, “It is not the role of the
court to pronounce the Second
Amendment extinct.”

And as much as it pains me to
put this in writing, I agree with
Scalia. ‘

The notion that the Second
Amendment applies only to
those citizens serving in a militia
is a specious argument put for-
ward by certain segments of the
American Left, which has a com-
mitment to ending gun violence
stronger than its commitment to
republican government.

I respect those supporters of
the handgun ban for their dedica-
tion to public safety, and I under-
stand their arguments.

I was one of them for some
time.

But over time I abandoned my
strong conviction that the Sec-

 
 

ond Amendment was a danger-
ous and racist relic of America’s
slaveholding past.

Let me explain. It is under-
stood in certain political and
historical circles that the Second
Amendment was included in the
Bill of Rights to placate South-
erners Who were less worried
about any physical threat from
the federal government than they
were about the threat posed by
their slaves.

In order to counter this threat,
Southern whites formed militias
to patrol plantations and prevent
slave rebellions. It was these mili-
tias that the Second Amendment
was designed to preserve.

The problem with this inter-
pretation of the Second Amend-
ment’s history is that it ignores
the greater republican history of
the armed citizenry.

The.role of an armed citizenry
in safeguarding republican liberty
and preventing tyranny dates
back to the days of the Roman
republic.

From Rome onward, the
armed citizenry has remained
a constant facet of republican
philosophy.An . armed- citizenry
founded the English republic, on
which this nation is largely mod-

eled, and it only failed when the

Jake Brett / Staff Cartoonist

people of England relinquished
their military power to a standing
army.

Americans today must be wary
that we do not repeat the mis-
takes of the ancient Romans and
the modern Britons. Americans
must not abdicate their respon-
sibility to protect themselves and
their families to the government.

Thursday’s Supreme Court
ruling amounts to an admission
that the government is not able to
protect the citizenry, and as such,
it is a citizen’s right to be able to
protect him or herself.

This is not a radical position:
Article XIII of the Declaration
of Rights of the 1776 Pennsyl-
Vania Constitution states, “The
people have a right to bear arms
for the defense of themselves
and the state.”

The men who wrote the Penn-
sylvania Constitution of 1776,
including Benjamin Franklin and
George Bryan, were not only pil-
lars of their community but also
leading politicians and philoso-
phers. What did they understand
about an armed citizenry that our
society has, forgotten?

Perhaps the answer lies in the
nature of citizenship during the
early republic.

Citizenship was extremely re-

Hate Pittsburgh weather? It hates you, too

    

by Molly Green
‘Co[ummLtt .

    

The city of Pittsburgh is pun-
ishing us. The humidity, the wind
and the ﬁve-minute thunder-
storms that continuously inter-
rupt otherwise beautiful weather:
punishment.

I came to this realization while
I was transporting a pile of cloth-
ing, which was at the time mari-
nating in a disturbingly gray soup

. of  rainwater. I was wet, cold

and shaking like an over-electrified
Furby, and, damn it, I wanted to
know why.

Why, for instance, does sum-
mer Pittsburgh weather always

appear to be hot and sunny until"

the exact second an unfortunate
person, suchas myself, steps out-
side, and then it instantly begins
to pour little day—ruir1ing drops of
devastation? Why so random?
Friends, that was when I real-
ized that I was being played. We
were all being played. Pittsburgh
weather isn’t random. No, it is me-

strictive in the early years of the
republic and so was gun owner-
ship. Both were regulated racially
and economically, and although I
don’t endorse such qualiﬁcations
for citizenship, it is important to
note that such qualiﬁcations made
the Second Amendment a lot less
dangerous to" private individuals

- and society as a whole.

But a lot has changed since
1776. The 14th Amendment es-
tablished birthright ’ citizenship
in 1868 and that made those
protected by the Second Amend-
ment a much less exclusive club.

And that is why I ‘support not

ticulously planned — by the very
city itself, I suspect —-— to teach us
a lesson. To keep us measly pup-
pets in line. You have to under-

stand that Pittsburgh is like the‘

Oprah of the weather world —— it
can be extremely generous, but do
not get on its bad side, or it will get
you back in ways you can’t even
imagine.

. Take this week, for instance.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette re-
ported that the Friends of the
Pittsburgh Urban Forest have
charged the city with abusing its
trees. Apparently we citizens have
been cinching tree bases with rope
and strangling trunks with orna-
mental lights (an attractive and
tasteful year-round decorationl).
The news is made public, and
BAM. Instant thunderstorm. That
is what we call classical condition-
ing. '

And there’s more. A little foray
into the National Weather Service
climate data shows that Pittsburgh

has been up to these tricks for,

quite some time.

for people

that protects the right of indi-
viduals to own handguns but also
the parts of the majority opinion
that reaffirm existing restrictions
on what guns can be purchased

.and where they can be carried.

In effect, the ruling did not
change much. Individuals still
cannot purchase machine guns,

and laws governing concealed‘_
. carry licenses remain unchanged.

In fact, for the ﬁrst Second
Amendment ruling in 70 years,
Thursday’s decision was actually
quite moderate.

Debate t/ye Second Amendment wit/2

Take early May of this year.
Mere days after the American
Lung Association designated Pitts-
burgh as the smoggiest U.S. city,
what should occur but another
massive thunderstorm, effectively
spoiling the week of the Fly Pitts-
burgh Kite: Club’s Big Spring Fly
and ruining the summer of thou-
sands, or maybe even hundreds,
of children.

Or last August when the city
had a massive heat wave — in
fact, Aug. 3 tied for the hottest
day in Pittsburgh history (at 103
degrees). That very day, we Pitts-
burghers foolishly welcomed Ron
Paul into the city, obviously a big
no—no. Coincidence? I think not.
Allowing Libertarians (who, by the
way, hate children) into the city is,
like, the biggest insult ever. In fact,
I would bet that we get an extra
inch of rain annually for every
Libertarian in the city.

Of course you’ll hear some
people say that cities aren’t con-
scious, and they certainly don’t
have omnipotent powers. They’ll

throw around big words like “sci-
ence” and “lake effect.” OK, lis-
ten. It hasnothing to do with this
bogus “lake effect” meteorologi-
cal crap. Don’t you think the city
has already inﬁltrated the weather
stations? Trust me, it was the first
thing it did after. taking over the
National Aviary (for its secret
army of birds). How else could
those weathermen — and weath-
erwomen — afford all the fake
tanning agent and Botox?

The simple facts and statistics
are right there.

After acquiring years worth of
placement in the top 10 dirtiest/
srnoggiest/ most polluted cities in
the nation, Pittsburgh also ranked
in the top 10 cloudiest U.S. cities
in 2006, averaging more than 200

days of annual cloud cover, and is_

the site of one of the most power-
ful strokes of lightning ever mea-
sured, at 345,000 amperes of elec-
tricity, according to the National
Weather Service.

It also ranks seventh for_tor-
nado activity between the last

two weeks of May and the first
two weeks of June, according to
VorTek, a company that develops
tornado assessment software.

So, there is obviously a corre-
lation here between how we treat
our city, and how our city treats us.
Probably this is a causal relation-

ship, because saying so better sup-

ports my argument.

I’ll be the ﬁrstto ‘admit that
Pittsburgh is a backstabbing, con-
niving little city (I didn’t leave my
house for almost a week after the
Great Blizzard of ’93), but it’s not
too late. We still have a chance to
save ourselves. Feed the economy
and buy a bunch of those com-
memorative Pittsburgh incline
magnets. Remove those harmful
(though attractive and tasteful)
lights from the city trees. I promise

you, if we don’t start treating the »

city with more respect, we will end
up like Cincinnati, Seattle or the
entire state of Florida -— yuck!

“Beer is living proof that God loves us and

wants us to be happy.”

' — Benjamin Franklin

 

Celebrating man's, realhest friend

by Dan Vetanovetz
' Staff Writer

What a terrible day to be out-
side. The air is sweaty before it
even hits Mr. Duvel’s skin, and
the clouds look like thugs down
a dark alley waiting to pounce
on "Friendship and drench Mr.
Duvel as he stands in the park-

. ing lot of the Sharp Edge.

Fortunately, Mr. Duvel is
underneath a tent shielding him
from violent rain, and the glut-
tonous beads of perspiration
ﬂopping down his sides are cool.
Because most fortunately of all,
Mr. Duvel is a cold beer in the
Sharp Edge’s annual Euro Beer
Fest.

As Mr. Duvel ‘attempts to

stare down Mr. Guinness from ’

across the shaded asphalt, thirsty
spectators hand more than $50
each for small glasses.

Each glass comes with a tick-
et that has 113 black rectangles
on it, signifying the number of
available beer samples. Duvel,
for example, is rectangle 75, and
Chimay White is rectangle 15.

All 113 beers, from Paulaner _ ,

Hefe at rectangle one to Ot-
terhead Ale at rectangle N (the
numbered rectangles only go

up to 99 and are followed by

letters), are European. Cheap-
thrills drinkers searching for
anything Budweiser or Miller

‘ will have to learn how to drink

all over again. 9

“Having this many high
styles of beer is an educational
thing,” said Reggie Calhoun, a

‘_ wholesales agent from McKees

Rocks. “You have to teach a lot
of people, and it puts a lot of ex-
citement and fun in the job.”
There are quite a‘ few things
to learn about beer, such as iden-

_ tifying myriad subtle tastes.

Attendees are even encour-
aged to show some class by rins-
ing out their glasses between
samples. Water pitchers sit at
each table, and drinkers toss the
rinse water anywhere on the as-
phalt after cleansing their glass-

Mr. Duvel, meet Mr. Guinness. At Sharp Edge’s aumual Euro Beer Fest, great beers from the other side
of the Atlantic tested the palates of Pittsburgh's most discerning drinkers.

es.

The whole tasting aspect
seems to suggest that attendees
take the drinking slowly, and do-
ing so is helped by" the rule that
each sample’ be no more than
two ounces. However, the alco-
hol by Volume for many repre-
sented beers rarnges all the way
up to 9 percent. That means that
two ounces of Duvel will pack
as much punch as six ounces of
the average American light beer.

Still, Sharp Edge owner Jeff
Walewski smiled, saying, “I
don’t want volume drinking  I
want people to taste the beers.”
The beers themselves are divided
into sections based on their local
area distributors or wholesalers.

For example, A.M. Lutheran
distributes -Newcastle Brown,
Harp and Chimay beers.

Sitting and supervising the
pouring process in that section
is Jessica Doran, Rich Ivanoff
and Bob Shope, all wholesal-
ers wearing college-styled shirts
emblazoned with beer logos such
as Guinness and Smithwick’s.

They’re quick to point out

which beer was their favorite.
“The best beer you can buy
is Chimay,” said Shope without

batting an eye. '

They discuss the background
of Chimay as a Belgian‘ beer
brewed by monks and note it
was a more noble beer than
most popular brands because it
isn’t advertised during the Super
Bowl or by neon lights.

When it comes to taste,
Ivanoff said, “Chimay is more
hoppy and sweet —”

“ —— and historic!” said Doran,
cutting off Ivanoff’s description.

Although the festival has its
educational merits, Walewski
knows how difﬁcult it is to pull
Pittsburghers away from all the
other events occurring across the

city during this season. Sports,

visits to parks and events like
BikeFest Downtown all pull
prospective attendees.

“Tl1ere’s only one European
beer festival though, and that’s
here!’—’ said Waleswki.

It’s somewhat of a gamble
on who’s going to show up: sea-
soned veterans or greenhoms?

Mike Vollmer and his brother
Rob are attending the festival for
the ﬁrst time but had the appear-
ance of experienced attendees as
they studied the list of beers in
the program.

“We haven’t been to any festi-
vals before, but we drink a lot of
beer,” said Mike with a chuckle.
“Pittsburgh needs more stuff like
this  it gets people out.”

Another attendee, Keith Mo-

Dead fan

brings his
jams fully
to life

by Dan Vetanovetz
Staﬂ Wrder

Not every long, strange trip is
the work of the Grateful Dead.

In fact; the travels of Deadhead
radio hero David Gans have had
somewhat of an effect on the Grate-
ful Dead. But rather than cashing in
on his associations with the famous
jam band, Gans has gone on to tell
his own stories. ,.

“Just because I’m a Deadhead
doesn’t mean that’s all I’m playing,”
said Gans.

His musical career is temporally
dominated by his occupation as a
disc jockey for “The Grateful Dead
Hour,” but his most recent accom-
plishment is the release of Tu/zlrféd

Pittsburghl -

A lot of it ended up at the Fiick Art Museum
in Point Breeze in its new exhibit, ‘ Pi Panorama of
Pittsburgh‘ Nineteenth—Century Printed Views”
The exhibit takes patrons through the cityfs his-
tory, from its humble  to its short
stint as “Pittsburg,” The event runs until Oct 5.

The exhibit consists of three rooms with
prints  from standard picture frame size
to posters bigger than the average dinner table.
Many of the prints have more smoke billow-
ing ﬁom buildings than clouds ﬂoating about
the sky. The exhibit also showcases small open
books in display cases and plaques that give
the pieces name, origin and painter/printer

Many of the pieces are quite historical, show-
ing the industrial look of Pittsburgh’s smoky
forges  the once open ﬁelds along its
periphery Several of the pieces were provided by

tiresome after a while

pathology,” and that “She
was sure that she wanted me once / But she’s
sure now she don’t.”

The songs ramble on without any worries,
slipping between a country—crooning dialect
and a complex lexicon that borders on science
fiction. The music itself isn’t anything to blast
from a pair of speakers or headphones. It’s
better served by letting it rumble out of an old
car’s speakers with the windows rolled down.

However, unlike in the era evoked by Gans’
music, taking a cruise down U.S. Highway 101
today is ﬁnancially frivolous. Gans, 54 years
old, acknowledges the difference between his
generation and the current college generation.
In his view, modern technology such as the
Internet and other computer interaction has
nudged music aside as the vehicle for social
change.

“Music isn’t really the number one 
anymore,” he said.

The irony buried ir1 this sentiment is that
Gans helped pioneer a Deadhead virtual com-
munity on the Internet; Through a friend ex-
perienced with computers, he was introduced
to an experimental online community, the
Well, and co—founded an online conference of
Deadheads there in 1986. Although the two
applications aren’t common in their functions,
imagine it as the equivalent of Facebook for
Deadheads at the beginning of the Internet
age.
Paired with the central Deadhead dnve to
see the Grateful Dead at multiple concert lo-
cations in a single season and the social func-
tion of  live tapes, the online commu-
nity took off. It’s still functioning today, and
the \Well, aside from holding an important
historical place in the dawning of the Internet
age, is host to many other conferences geared
toward intellectual and cultural discussion.

Yet Gans is modest about his role in the
technological extension of Deadhead culture,
to the point that he could be seen as unaware
of his involvement in the cultural progression.
He serenely views the Internet as a tool and is
more content to use music as his method of
communication with others.

“I’m tryin’ to enlighten people in a_ non-
aggressive way,” said Gans, explaining his
View of the differences in generation outlooks
toward music and technology.

His lyrics can still bite, though, as he sings,
“The man who stole the future / Has an oil
drum for a heart,” before launching into his

July 2, 2008

acts as more of a musi-
cal everyman, and his songs don’t attempt to
grasp anything more. It’s a folksy style without

much ado.

 

   

“The first most important  is song-
writing,” said Gans.

Although he enjoys his music, Gans is
not the type for “travelin’ around like Woodie
Guthrie.” He keeps his main job as a radio
host and chooses his performances accord-
ing to his personal tastes. This clearly plays a
grounding role for Gans, although he has the
experience of the rock ’n’ roll era, he lacks its
ego. It’s difficult to find bombast in what he
says, whether it’s his lyrics or his conversation.

MI-Ige’s “currently slated‘ for July 6 in Pitts-

    
 

      
 

 

   

burgh at the Thunderbird Cafe.

“I’ve always liked playin’ in Pittsburgh,”
said Gans, remembering warm receptions at
small venues across the city.

It might be expected for him to arrive in
town amid a dusty whirlwind with the same
guitar that started his music career in 1970.
But don’t expect it to be a very loud one.

“I’m not foolish enough to think I Q3
change the worl ” said Gans, “but I’m still
out there tryin’ to change the little corners of
it”

Russell Westbrook and the Memphis Grizzlies
picking forward Kevin Love. It was the ﬁrst
time in NBA draft history that the first three
selections were freshmen.

‘ The Thursday draft, however, was remem-
bered for the amount of trades that took place.
The Timberwolves traded the rights to Mayo,
Marko Jaric, Antoine Walker and Greg Buck-
ner for the rights to Love, Mike Miller, Brian
Cardinal and Jason Collins. The big trade took
place when the NewJersey Nets traded former
U.S. Olympian Richard Jefferson in exchange
for YiJianlian and Bobby Simmons.

The Nets, which might be moving to
Brooklyn as early as 2010, have garnered the
interest of NBA superstar LeBron James, ac-
cording to the Associated Press. James has
repetitively said he would love to play in his
favorite city, and the Nets getting rid of Jef-
ferson allows them to offer him the maximum
salary if he opts out of his current contract
with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010.

Soccer

The UEFA European Soccer Champion-
ships ended Sunday with Spain topping Ger-
many in the ﬁnal in Vienna, Austria, to win its
first major tournament since the European
Soccer Championships in 1964.

Spain scored the only goal of the match
when Liverpool striker Fernando Torres
struck a beautiful shot that ended up in the
back of the net in the 33rd minute. Spain won
the match, 1-0.

Tennis

The top two American players in men’s
tennis, Andy Roddick and James Blake, both
lost in the second round of W/irnbledon, ac-
cording to atptennis.com.

Former world No. 1 and two-time Grand
Slam champion Marat Saﬁn has reached the
quarterﬁnals in surprising fashion by beating
four opponents with higher rankings than
him.

Mario Ancic will play Roger Federer in a
quarterﬁnal match today Ancic was the last
person to beat Federer at Wmbledon six years
ago.

' Federefs nemesis, Rafael Nadal, will face

Andy Murray in a highly anticipated show— J

down. Murray is the ﬁnal remaining British
player  Wimbledon.

On the women’s side, Venus and Serena
