After two years of reporting
and editing, Paul E. Pﬁschner C44,
has taken over the‘ job as editor
of the News. Paul succeeds Char-
lie Camarata who left for the
army yesterday.

Last year Paul dictated stories

I Czechs Celebrate

Anniversary in

Foster Hall

To commemorate the ninety-
third anniversary of the birth of
Thomas G. Masaryk, ﬁrst presi-
dent of Czechoslovakia, those
Pittsburghers who knew him will
discuss personal memories of him
next Tuesday evening at 8 o’clock
in the social room of Stephen
Foster memorial.

The meeting is to be sponsored
jointly by ‘the Czechoslovakian
Nationality Room committee, un-
der the chairmanship of 1Vl'.r.
Schramm, and the Czechoslovak-
ian Student group. George Gibian,
C44, is the student president.

The" laurel wreath around the
bronze portrait of Masaryk in the
Czechoslovakian Room is in hon-
or of the occasion.

Masaryk, the “President-Lib-
erator” of the Republic of Czech-
oslovakia, left his home in Prague
and at the age of 65 became a
voluntary exile working with Bri-
tain, Russia, and the United
States for the defeat of the Cen-
tral Powers. This paved the way
for the declaration of the inde-
pendence of Czechoslovakia which
was announced at our own Inde-
pendence Hall in Philadelphia on
October 18, 1918.

Typical of the philosophy of
Thomas Masaryk was his state-
ment that life required’ “not
violence but peace, not the sword

but the plough, not blood but_

work, not death, but life for the
sake of life.”

“Because he was such an out-
standing personality, the Univer-
sity wishes to honor one of the
most important world ﬁgures of
the ﬁrst quarter of the twentieth
century” said Mgs. Ruth Mitchell,
adviser to the nationality rooms.

WSSF Drive
Total Doubled

Contributions to the World Stu.

ycar’s total.

Dr. James Stinchcomb, faculty
sponsor of this year’s WSSF an-
nounced that $432 had already been
collected last Tuesday, March 2.

Dr. Stintchcomb said, “I'm de-
lighted with the results of the
campaign so far. As yet most of

been solicited and it is expected
that their contributions will swell
the fund considerably. The —»work
of the Student Committee has
been outstanding.”

The money will be used to help
Chinese students and to provide
educational and recreational facil-
ities for United Nations prisoners
of war. This money is distributed
by the YMCA war prisoners aid
of which WSSF is a part.

it We   Who Remain. . .

Today a sizeableiigi'o11p of Pitt men are bidding farewell
to the University. They are aboutto begin their period of

A A. training to make them skilled in the an of modern wa.rl’are.
-c The distance separating the soldier from the civilian is so
great that the very thought of army life makes us stop to con-
sider the whys and wherefores for the present train of events.
The soldier  the servant of his country. If necessary

he must. sacriﬁce his liberty,

his health, or life itself. His

life is restricted so that he can nolonger consider himself

his own master.

Nevertheless, it is not with misgivings that we take leave
of the departing men. We know that our cause is just. Our
enemies are threatening our very national existence. They
are indirectly menacing the University of Pittsburgh. Every
, . principle considered ‘fundamental. in the United States and in
the universe is in peril of its very existence. Under these cir-
cumstances and apart from personal :ti'riendsli.ip we are prcnul
that so many of our comrades are contrilduting their .\‘t:‘l"\"lt'6‘.*:

to this war.

We know that they will distinguish themselves  their
new jobs. And we know that they will faitlitully and success-
fully complete every task assigned them. lt is to be hoped
that the students who remain at the University can t'nlt‘ill
their trust as well as the departing men. ‘

‘ AWe students who remain have a real trust to maintain.
It is a trust fully as important as any requiring physical ef-
fort. VV e must preserve intact the spirit of learning, the spirit
of the liberal arts, the spirit of democracy itself. We have been
hard hit by the departure of many of our best young men; yet
our attitude must be one of vitality. Though cut down, activi-
ties must continue. We must 'conduct ourselves as the proud
rear guard of the American university. tradition. In our hearts
we must believe ﬁrmly that every day is one day closer to vic-
V tory, one day closerto the future return to normalcy.
Finally the day" will come when many of the men who
are now departing will returnto the University. Their job
will have been completed. »Wil_l they return to 'a more shadow
of theyinsftitution they left? We refer to ashadow in spirit
=a.nd.no_-t in population. Lotus hope that in the future months
of hardships -ahead the spirit previously referred to will.

’ burn as brightly as ever.

~ VVe who remain must fight this 7war with as much fervor ,’

 -as; a.ny—so‘ldier.’ Cooperation‘ with the war effort is as deﬁnite
' 'a§'ne.cessity as a gun. More subtle is the necessity to be t‘o_lera.nt

SPORTS EDlTOR

As far as we are concerned this is positively going to be
the last word on the amazing Pitt basketball team of ’l.€l—~l2-3.
And ‘We consider it only ﬁtting and proper that Doctor Carlson
should have it. '

“This was a_te2im of character,” begins the Doctor who is
somewhere credited with the statement that. he started the
‘season with a team composed of two ball. players, eight ex-
pendables, and two non-essentials. “Right at the beginning we
had to make a decision. l.-Ve could either let ourselves be kicked
around by the otherteams or we could ﬁght. The boys elected
to fight.
_ ‘Ne made mistakes in the Bethany game that almost lost
it for us. VVe had quite a talk in the dressing room al'terwards.
No one telt very good and I Quoted the boys a few lines from

a poem by Bill Morrell, (the late University Editor)——“there '

are paths beyond the mind where reason never trods.” Those
lines show pretty well how our team. adniittedly deﬁcient in
talent, could go as tar as it did. Those kids had character and
they won because they had the ability to win.”

Of course the Carlson Kids also lost ganies and this is
where the Doctor injects his favorite topic, the fatigue curve.

“We_didn’t have much to_begin with and did not reach. our
peak until the West Virginia game. Now it is an absolute

_ physiological fact that as you work you tire. You may work

up to your "full capacity time after time, but the longer you
keep atit the less you will be able to produce. The boys were
-putting out just as ‘much at the end of the season as at the
‘beginning but tvheresults were always a little less.” - P

. _ As far as the Doctor is concerned the game that packed
the most in thrills was the one played at Army. That was the
32-31 in the last few seconds. But letzhim

_They'missed it, but Malarkey let himself get boxed in and the

"fellow pumped the shot in. That left us just one point ahead.»
.4 Army was awarded two foul shots. Both were _good and we
l were behind one point. There wereone minute and seven sec-

onds left to play, and Army started freezing the ba.1l.‘But -with
exactly twenty.-ﬁve seconds left Artman intercepted a. pass.
He tossed to Swacus who passed to Malarkey. ‘.‘Old Happy
Arms” made it and we won 32-31.”

Equally exciting though was the first Pitt-Penn State

game when the Pitt were ﬁve points behind. With just five

minutes to go Pitt suddenly got‘ hot and ll-’lalarkey made three
field goals, Artman made a foul shot, Jones made a ﬁeld goal,
and Artinan contributedanother ﬁeld goal. Pitt was six points
‘ahead, when State came back to make five points. But the game
ended with the score 38-37.

Strangely enough the members of team consider the first
West Virginia game the most e_\;citino'. The Pitts won this
game easily enough .48-3.3, but then this was the game in which
the Panthers first got their view of the promised land. Un-
fortunately, it turned out to be only a mirage, but as any of
the boys will tell you, it was nice while it lasted and it is prob-
ably better to have had a chance and lost than never to have
had a chance at all. 2

“It. was fun while it lasted." admits the Doctor, “but I'm
glad it’s over.” Since the Doctor has been unoiticially d-ra.§:'ted
by Pitt’s Army, he is now concentrating on making those 7
A. M. inspection calls. So in all probability any freezing he
doesin the near i:'uture will concern appendixes rather than
Basketballs. ‘

By HAROLD LIEBER

Capt. S. M. Rickman of the med-
lcal staff of the Army Air Corps is
line of the oﬁicers working to safe-
guard the health and safety of the
air candidates now quartered in the

.. University. In a recent conference

Captain Rickman stated that the

» aims of the men’s health service

{were to prevent disease and to lose
as few as possible man-power days.
It also strives to make certain that
jeach individual soldier gets ade-
quate personal care, including den-
tal care. The army medical service
provides all forms of health protec-
tion as well as carrying on an ex-
Etensive public health service.

Upon arrival at the University,
each cadet received a thorough
medical examination. After the
examination, a week’s quarantine
was enforced to prevent the
spreading of any communicable
diseases to the students. It is for
this reason that the civilians
have been prohibited from enter-
ing any of the areas occupied by
the cadets. The examination in-
cluded anti-tetanus, small pox,
and yellow fever inoculations.

This extensive program to safe-

guard the cadets’ health leads
from the medical center on- the 34th
ﬂoor to the sub-basement mess hall,

.1’.

cers lnsure Hea

Pitt's Air Crew Cadets

gwhere rigid supervision of all foods '

is carried out.

The _question of a contagious
disease being contracted by the
cadets and spread to the civilian
student body has caused much
discussion. Capt. Rickman, how-
ever, gave his assurance that
such fears have no basis, since
the strict monthly examination of
each individual cadet will elim-
inate any such possibility.

It was stated that when the next
‘contingent of pre-ﬂight candidates
arrive at the University the first

  

33:5! 2;:s::§<!v1l%»-~-‘~.r w‘ 5 ,. W as:

of next month, they will be quar-
antined in a separate group and
prohibited from contacting any
member of the service group that
arrived this month. In this way all
the candidates are freed of any
disease threat and insure the safety
and health of the entire University.
The medical set-up at the Uni-
versity will be centered around
the health service on the 34th I
ﬂoor, Cathedral. In case of added
needs or of an emergency, the
army will have full access to all
the local and suburban hospitals
and medical services. The Old
Marine hospital and the Aspin-
wall Veteran’s hospital will be
utilized in case of any such emer-
gency. While in the Army’s use,
complete military supervision
will be instituted.

Cadets here at the University will
be cared for, and the complete out-
line of their day will be the charge
of the medical department. From
the time of reville at 6 :30 o’clock un-
til lights out at 9:30 o’clock the
utmost health precautions will be
exercised. There will be special
classes in ﬁrst aid and disease pre-
vention. Also in these classes, the
cadets will be taught how to purify
water and to make all types of
health provisions to fit any climate.

Medical oﬁicers wish to express
their gratitude to Dr. Carlson, Dr.
Kowallis and Mr. Weber with
especial emphasis on the unselﬁsh
efforts of Cpl. George Aiken who
has on many occasions worked un-
ceasingly far into the night. -

“It is hoped that eventually a
closer arrangement will be
brought about between the sol-
diers and the civilians at the
University, guaranteeing that all
possible health precautions have
been taken to maintain the health
of both the studertts and the
cadets,” said Captain Rickman.

Jefferson   Ora tor)’ Con testiif
Sponsored At University  

A Jefferson oratory contest is
to be held at the Universiity in
conjunction with the national con-
test which is being sponsored by

the Sun-Telegraph and other
Hearst newspapers.
The winner of the contest,

which is to be concluded at the
University by Monday,'March 15,
will then participate in a local
contest. Should the Pitt repre-
sentative win the local contest
also a national elimination will

follow in New York. Expenses to -

New York will be paid by the
Sun-Telegraph.

Subject of the orations is
“Thomas Jefferson, the Great
American.” A student may focus
on one aspect of Jefl'erson’s life
or use the biography in full. The
facts of his life are appearing
for the beneﬁt of the orators in
the daily Sun-Telegraph.

A local contest will select a

winner from the winners at local
colleges. Seven prizes will be
awarded. First prize is a $250 war
bond; second, a $100 war bond;
third, a $50 war bond; fourth,
ﬁfth, sixth and seventh, $25 war
bonds.

“In view of the fact that there
are seven prizes and only ﬁve
colleges in the city, a student of
the University is virtually certain
to win one of the prizes,” said Dr.
Charles W. Lomas, director of
Men’s Debate. ‘

Students who wish to enter the
contest must do so through the
speech classes or by contacting Dr.
Lomas, or Miss Haun, director of
Women’s Speech Association.

Orations must be original and not
manuscript read. “Bombastic ora-
tory will not be considered,” an-
nounce the judgis. Senator Carter
Glass of Virginia is national hon-
orary chairman of the contest.

Business Results Fall

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict last week lost nearly all the

reau of Business Research.

A decided decline was noticed in
the volume of trade and in origi-
