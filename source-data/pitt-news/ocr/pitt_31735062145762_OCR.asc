Let’s Smash The Machine
NLY THE MOST NAIVE among us will be-
lieve that the political machine which has had
control on the campus for the past few years will
forget factionalism and allow the campus to vote
freely on the ﬁfty candidates presented today. \Ve
expect the same sort of political activity from the
machine that it has exhibited in the past, and up
to this stage of the game this year we have not
been disappointed.

It is imperative that every student on the cam-
pus register his vote next Monday. With the poll-
ing place situated at Memorial hall, it is not phys-
ically impossible for anyone to vote. Bring your
registration card and vote for the outstanding peo-
ple on the ballot. There are at least thirty.

T IS IMPERATIVE, too, that your vote be not

regimentcd with the votes of the organized ma-
chine. It is a pity that the great mass of independ-
ent voters on the campus allow six fraternities to
win every election. This rule must be ended on
Monday. The machine must ﬁnd itself on the
short end of the score. Its abuses have been many.
It has been attacked not only by independents but
by rival fraternities. All these opponents have
right to complain. Like a decadent political ma-
chine in Pittsburgh, its campus counterpart has
abused its privileges. The campus should end
those abuses.

lVitness the old-game political activity of the
machine already this semester. It has been secret-
ly, until exposed in the News, collecting registra-
tion cards for voting purposes. It has regimented
its followers and has succeeded in placing a goodly
number of men on the ballot, after proper political
activity beforehand was accomplished. Its candi-

dates are of the same stripe as its candidates in the
past. Among them are not numbered either those
with highest scholastic average nor those most
outstanding in activities on the list of ﬁfty. The
independent vote on the campus must end this rule
of the mediocre.

Students who have never in their University ca-
reers voted before are strongly urged to vote on
Monday. A larger vote than ever must be polled
if we are to have a decent, upright, straig~11tfor-
ward group in the University assembly.

OTE FOR STUDENTS in your own group.

Tlierc are enough names on the ballot to as-
sure your acquaintance with at least four people.
The two Negro students on the ballot will have
sufﬁcient support. This itself is a praiseworthy
step. forward in governmental conditions at Pitt.
All minorities will be represented.

Vile cannot too strongly recommend the out-
standing people on the ballot. Presidents of cam-
pus wide organizations are listed. Outstanding
members of the debating team, YMCA, YIVCA,
publications, and other campus activities appear
on the ballot. These students, already recognized
as outstanding should be named to the University
assembly.

The Monday election is Pitt’s chance to get a
good student. government. ' It is your duty to vote.
There is NO obstacle which can prevent you from
voting. Vote and smash the machine.

 

Fraternity Futures

FRATERNITIES, unless they “buck up,” are doomed.
By fraternities is meant all social, scholastic, and ex-
tracurricular groups that exist because of the desire of
man to have close social contacts.

Formed originally as drinking clubs, to further formal
debates or for the purpose of fellowship, the modern pro-
totype of these ﬁrst fraternities has lost all sight of the
original objective. In some cases it is just as well, in
others not. Be that as it may the fact still remains that
fraternities today are, in a good many cases, boarding
clubs——a place to ea.t and sleep.

The evil seems to lie somewhat in the fact that when
the fraternity idea took root and began to grow, there
were a good many young men attending college or simi-
lar institutions that were disgruntled when refused by a
certain social group and so set up a. group of their own.
This is particularly true of recently formed organiza-
tions. With the single idea in mind—that of being a
member of a fraternity—v'arious students have set up
organizations of their own. Their'faults are in having
no sound foundation or laudable and worthwhile objec-
tive.

Another slough that the fraternity idea has fallen into
is that of forming organizations for the purpose of ﬁnan-
cial gain. No college or university is immune from this
kind of organization and damage is done to fraternities
as a whole.

Inside these informal clubs, no close bond is woven,
and any activity indulged in is purely selﬁsh and for
those particular members alone. No broa.d program for
the betterment of the college as 3. whole is considered.
A good many of these clubs or fraternities have failed
during the debacle of the last four years, and it is well,
but the harm done to fraternities is irreparable. The
fraternity cause has suffered from the sins of omission
of these the smallest members.

The time has passed when men came to college from
distant parts of a state or section, knowing no one and
feeling uncomfortable and lonely. Nowadays travel,
transportation and communication facilities have welded
huge groups of people into an integral mass which is
familiar with its component parts. College dormitories
and highly specialized groups of students have been the
means of aclimating the freshman to the scenes of his
intended endeavors. Reserve and aloofness have been
broken down and in their places have come a new cam-
araderie which includes large groups of students who be-
come fast friends, without the means of ﬁnancial or fra-
ternal obligations as a solder. The freshman no longer
feels that he can ﬁnd friendship only in the bonds of a
fraternity, or that he needs to seek any more friends
than he usually ﬁnds during the first two weeks of
college.

It is a safe prediction that fraternities will eventu-
ally break down or else they will be forced to evolve
into some other form. The ﬁne system that once stood
for so much, many years Ago, is fast deteriorating, and
some change is bound to take place before many years
are past.——West Virginia Daily Athenaeum. ‘

 

Letters From Readers

 Twenty Years Ago
l Today

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your recent editorial which threw
mud on the general fraternity situa-
tion and especially on the set up at
Pitt was ably refuted by Mr. Vvillison.
In rebuttal you stressed merely the
high cost of fraternity membership.
But I think you have overstressed
this point to the exclusion of all the
ﬁne points that support the fraternity
program at Pitt.

Believing that these ﬁne points are

the keynote in this discussion, I am
setting them down as bona ﬁde sup-
port of fraternities:
1. They are the only perpetual
homogeneous group.
T‘hey supply 75 per cent of the
support of all social aﬁairs.
3. They put all the support and
spirit into the Spring Festival
VVeek.

_l0

4. They are the only living groups I

on the campus. Approximately
one-half of the out-of-town men
are living in fraternity houses.
5. They combine in cliques which
are healthy to campus politics.
They keep interest up where it
would ordinarily be lacking. The
fraternity man in power has an
organized group to back him up.
6. They do the major work in activ-
ities.

nity men.

7. They are always called as an or-
ganized group to put the needed
push into any emergency or cam-
pus drive.

8. They afford, beca.use of the lack
of campus life, the only place
where "college life and Pitt spirit

and tradition can be perpetuated.
9. They encourage s c h o l a s tic
achievement. The All Fraternity
average is always equal to or
greater than the All Men’s aver-
age.
They represent the greatest
alumni interest in the University.
An Alumnus’ ﬁrst and lasting im-
pression of Pitt comes through
his fraternity.
They foster leadership qualities
through an added
that the member holds from an
organized group.
They offer practically the only
common ground where faculty
men and students can get to-
gether on an informal basis.
They sponsor the only organized
intermural athletic program at
Pitt.
They permit certain promising
athletes and scholars a chance to
earn their board and room so that
they can remain in school.
They tend to increase the social
standards of their members.
They have chapters all over the
United States which mean a place
of welcome when the brother is
away from home.
They help to widen and maintain
a member's circle of friends.
They take claim to a member's
prestige . . . and shoulder his bad
points in an endeavor to correct
his faults.

These few pertinent facts do not
comprise the entire scope of the fra-
ternity situation, but they might
serve their purpose if they can show
the reader the signiﬁcance of frater-
nities at Pitt and elsewhere. .

By Irving Terrier

 

The cause of woman’s suff1'a.ge is
advancing at a. rapid pace not only
among the fair sex, but also among
the traditional wielders of the ballot.
Furthermore, in the faculty of the
University of Pittsburgh is to be
found a strong advocate of “Votes for
Women.” This progressive and “up
to the future” professor is 171‘. F. D.
Tyson, of the school of economics.
Not only is Dr. Tyson an advocate of
suffrage extention, but he is an active
worker in the “cause,” holding the po-
sition of secretary of the Men’s
League for VVomen’s Suffrage.

“It’s going to come,” says Dr. Ty-
son, “so youhad better get on the
wagon.”

Many of the students are skeptical
as to this touching sentiment, some
even intimating that we may look for
the doctor’s name on the next ballot
as the women’s candidate for—?

COED’S KITCHEN LAMENT
That steamin dish you laid before me, sir,

Excited me to wonder what’s within,
Some fancy sole or mackerel I thought,

Perhaps a sirloin carved so thin.

Perhaps it was a bit of German food, I thought,

A glass of beer was all I needed then;

Or maybe peppered Spanish food you brought,

Or eggs, the product of some sullen hen.

I didn't want to look. I tried to guess.

Some tasty rarebit Welsh to be correct;
An English pudding or a Danish paste,

Thus into realms of culinary art I did project.
But later, what I thought was some unusual dish
Proved nothing but a plate of good gefulte fish!

Basement Of Cathedral Serves

As Concrete Mixing Workshop

(This is the second of a series of
articles concerned with Cathedral con-
struction work).

 

Delving two floors below the Fifth
avenue ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral,
we reach the lowest level below city
streets and we come upon another
complete workshop under the roof of
the world’s greatest school building.

It is crowded into about ﬁfty square
feet of working space in the hallway
that will some day separate two small
auditoriunis in the basement of our
building, within easy wheelbarrow
distance of elevators that speed thirty-
four floors upward. Yet around it are
stored tons and tons of material, all
of which will be used and more or-
dered——perliaps even before the week
is over.

There all the concrete is mixed that
is used in this immense building, and,
if you are to believe your eyes, you
will agree that thousands and thou-
sands of tons have already’ been made
and forgotten, and that thousands
more will be mixed before the Cathe-
dral is completed.

This small area houses one large
concrete mixer, halt‘ a dozen mortar
boxes, eight concrete buggies
(which are queer huge-wheeled con-
traptions that contractors claim are
much more efficient than wheelbar-
rows in conveying wet concrete) I_na.ny
wheelbarrows, shovels, hoes, mixers
and all the other necessary tools to
keep a big building constantly “on the
build.” _ _ _ _

Trucks make daily trips right into
the basement of the building with
their loads of sand and gravel. Many
supplies cannot be Dl11‘Ch3Sed ‘Tom
Pittsburgh contractors and therefore
are brought in carload lots and stored
at hand in the basement_ A constant
inventory of cement from Birming-
ham, Alabama, and Portland, Oregon,
and equaling nearly 240,000 pounds, ls
stored in bags, making a_ barricade
successful not only in partitioning off
the room, but also in retaining the
heat during cold weather. An immense
pile of white sand from another dis-
tant point stands in what will some
day be a lecture room.

And there it is, a minute part of
the great workshop that is the Ca-
thedral. Yet from this little concrete
“plant” comes all the concrete that
is used in the construction of this
great building. Hundreds_of workmen
depend on it every day, in especially
large numbers on the fourth and ﬁfth
floors, and from the thirty-sixth ﬂoor
to the roof tower, where the laying
of ﬁreprooﬁng concrete structures was
begun last Tuesday afternoon. _

According to contractors and in-
spectors on the job, at the present
rate of construction the Cathedral
will be ﬁnished one year from now,

perhaps in time for the class of 1935;
to be graduated in its incoinparable

Commons room.

Beta Gamma Sigma Elects
14 Students As Members

 

Seven juniors and seven seniors
in the School of Business Administra-
tion, downtown division, were elected
last week to membership in Beta
Gamma Sigma, national honorary so-
ciety in commerce.

Candidates were judged according
to good moral character, high scholar-
ship and promise of marked busi-

Tracknien Point
For Penn Relays

 

Outclass Owls In Dual Meet;
Freshmen Nose Out Erie

Coach Carl Olson is whipipng his
men into shape this week for the
greatest track classic of them all, the
Penn Relays, scheduled for Friday
and Saturday at Philadelphia. Above
all else, the Panthers are out to re-
peat their last year's triumph in the
mile relay event.

Of the four men who brought glory
to the lliiiversity by their great per-
formance last year, only two, Keller
and Kiger, are eligible to compete
this year. The third member of the
present team is Harold Connelly.
sophomore star. Bill Mclvliinii, an-
other sophomore, was originally slated
for the fourth position but a. leg in-
jury has kept him out of action thus
far. In the event that Mt-1\.lunii is
still not ready, either McDonald or
Great will round out the quartet.

She Owls from 'I‘cmp—le didn't give
mm-.li of a hoot when they opposed
the Pitt. trackmen at the Stadium Sat-
urday, for the Panthers were in ﬁne
form and ronrped olt with a 110-25 vic-
tory. Olsons men made a clean
f~‘V"9€’l3 of no less than six events and
niissed first places in only three
eveiits.

Captain Bill Keller tied with Jimmy
Guay for higli-point honors, each win-
ning two events. Keller took both
The Quarter-niile and half-niile while
Giiajv won both hurdles races. Keller’s
time in the lialf-mile failed to break
the University record but the poor

of 1:594 look good indeed.

Show “Real Spirit”
In Spring Drills

Playing Of Marwood Stark, 158-
Pound “Watch Fob” Guard
Impresses Coaches

In spite of four long weeks of hard
football practices the members of the
squad are showing plenty of spirit.
Dr, Sutherland declares “that there is
more spirit and interest shown this
year than any other year.”

The candidates for the line posi-
tions, from end to end are being in-
structed in the fundamentals. The
coaching staff is overlooking no bets
when it comes to selecting guards,
tackles and ends. One of the most
promising looking guards at the pres-
ent time is none other than the 158-
pound Marwood Stark. Although he
is the “watch fob” type he is an ex-
ceptionally ﬁne player, Every man on
the coaching staff will willingly assert
that “StarI<ie” is one of the nicest
follows on the squad to work with. He
plays a particularly ﬁne defensive
game and it not at all mediocre on
the oi'i‘ensive. Dr. Sutherland be-
lieves that in spite of his impaired
noariing ‘Starkie” will play a con-
siderable anioiint of football for the
Panthers in the next two seasons.
When it comes to naming other indus-
i,.1‘l.’)I1S candidates the best method is
to go right through the entire roster
of 50 some candidates. The veterans
of two years; Captain Hartwig, Orin-
iston, K‘liskey, Shotwell, Booker, Hoe],
Oleojinsak, Weinstock, 'Weisenbaugh,
Seiffert, Kutz, Gongloff,
Munas, Vlojcihovsky, Balasia and:
all the others besides the sophomore
candidates, Greene, Stoughton, Mc-
Clure, Baxter, Randour, Shedlosky,
LaRue, Detzel, Glassford, Wol1gle-
ninth, and Rector, all realize the im-
portance of spring worl(—outs as well
as the suicide schedule for next sea-
son and are learning all of the foot-
ball they can right now.

No less than nine candidates are
putting in serious bids for the two
lialfbaclc posts, and as yet no tentative
selectioiis have been made, let alone

positions are three players who have!

been on the squad for two years,
Vveiseiiiiaiigli, Nicksick,
gileone.

The ﬁeld being dry for the last few
days gave the backs a fine opportun-
ity to do some real running_ Practic-
ing on a muddy ﬁeld hindered the
backfield men and forward passers
considerably, and as result their work

was retarded a great deal.

PiI:I: News Sports Editor
Tennis Talk

Nate Ganger, Panther tennis captain, has had a rather interesting court

career, despite his comparatively few years. While attending high school at
Cleveland East High he won the Ohio State Interscholastic championship. In
1929 he represented Ohio in the National Junior championships at Culver,
,losing to Ellsworth Vines, California representative, 6-4, 7-5. His ﬁne show-
Iing against Vines was largely responsible for his being ranked eleventh
Eamong the national juniors that year. With Fred Brace, captain at Michigan
;last year, he was ranked seventh in junior doubles in 1929. In 1932 the Pan-
Itlier captain copped the Cleveland City Piiblic,Park cliainpionship and rep-
§resented that city at the national tournament in Louisville. Last year he and
[his older brother, Mont, won the Cleveland city doubles championships and
Ithe Northwestern Ohio doubles title.
I The Panthers this year have a schedule that is both long and arduous.
iSixteen matches with Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, Navy and Georgetown are
packed so closely together that only once do the netmen get as many as
Ifour days’ rest between matches. Last year the tennis team lost only two
IlI18..tCl1€S, one to George VVashington and one to Navy, and scored about ten
ivictories, including two over the Duke-s and two over Tech. Captain Ganger
gand his mates are aiming high this year. They say they will be satisﬁed with
inothing less than a clean slate. However, it can be counted at. very success-
iful season should they do as well as they did last year. ..

3 Phys. Ed. School No Cure .

 For years and years back Carnegie Tech students and aliinmi have been
yelling for a physical education school. For that many years it has been :3
quaint old custom over at Tech to have many high schoolatliletes come to
good old Carnegie only to have them fall to traverse safely the rough old
. road of examinations. Now, the boys over there argue, perhaps correctly, that
,if the school authorities should ﬁnd it advisable to install :1 school of physical
ieducation, Tech football would go up the scale instead of down. They point
‘out as examples of this to Pitt, Duquesne and other schools whose football is
perhaps a little ‘better than theirs. However, the reasoning that a physical

education school is the solution of football eligibility problems is not on»

, tirely clear.

Carnegie Tech for years had a course in the teaching of manual train-
ing. It seems logical that if some of the football candidates haven’t what it
' takes to pass a course in wood-work they should not rate exceedingly high in
gphysical education. Then, too, a good course in physical education is as dif-
iﬁcult as any other course in any university. Once this was not so. Physical
;education was a. joke. Now, however, America still far behind Japan, Ger-

‘Vﬂke  many and Russia, is becoming more and more conscious of the physical well-
v ' ns,

-being of its youth. High schools are demanding well trained physical di-
rectors. Colleges and universities have responded by raising their standards.
Physical education is no longer the snap course it once was. Tech students
may ﬁnd that a physical education course is not the cure-all they think.

Behind 3-0, Wins 6 Straight

The doubles matches were called off
because of a snow storm, but Pitt in
the singles won ﬁve matches to one
for Grove City. I-Vlien the doubles
were halted the Pitt team of Ganger
and Madden were tied one set apiece.
Grove City was represented in the
doubles by Holstein and Hoburg.

Ganger of Pitt, in the No_ 1 match,
had to come from behind to defeat
Holstein in the opening set. He trailed
three games to none, and then put on
a spurt to take the set, 6 to 3.

The entire Panther team showed to
advantage, the play of James Thomp-
