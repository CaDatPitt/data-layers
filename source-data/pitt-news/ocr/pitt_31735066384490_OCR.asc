Pitt Trustees Vote 22-1 to Increase Tuition

ByJIMLEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
Tuition will be raised begin-
ning spring term, the University’s
Trustees voted, 22-1, yesterday.

The increase, $3 per credit-hour
for undergraduates in the spring ($5
for graduate students) and $50 per
term beginning next fall ($55 for
graduate students), is a result of the
lack of additional state funding by
the Commonwealth, Chancellor
Posvar charged.

“We are doing what the
circumstances are imposing on us,”
Posvar said. “Higher education is
decaying and decaying rapidly—all
we are are simply victims.”

Posvar’s statements came after

~(:)i3oard chairman William H. Rea

said Pitt had lost $4290 a day due to
the loss of income, problem of
cash-flow, and cost of borrowing
over the last eight months while
state legislators delayed in drawing
up a ﬁscal budget.

“This leaves us with a deﬁcit of

the operating budget of $2.8
million,” Rea said. “Our total loss
will be over $1 million.”

The tuition hike puts Pitt close to
the cost of many private schools,
Posvar said.

“We’re already ﬁrst in the country
in tuition charged in a public
sector,” Posvar said. “Not only do
we have the highest tuition, but
studies show that our student
families are the least able to pay for
it. Step by step, Pennsylvania is
backing out of its committment to
public education. There is a very
small cost difference between
private colleges and us.”

Commonwealth Trustee A.E.
Lawson, who was appointed by the
Governor, was the only voting
member to speak against the hike.
He cited confrontation politics as
the best answer to the University’s
problems.

“Confrontation politics is the

Fire Safety

Devices Added
0 &_To Elevators  

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer
Fire safety devices are now being
installed in all University elevators

in compliance with a state law’

effective June 1, 1981.

The code states all elevators
serving three or more ﬂoors or
traveling more than twenty-ﬁve
feet must be equipped with a safety
device that will respond to ﬁre
alarms within the building, causing
the elevator to continue to its
destined ﬂoor and then immedi-
ately return to the ground ﬂoor.
The present system stops the

,. evator immediately during a ﬁre

75;22:ert,«a process that in many cases
necessitates ﬁremen running up
numerous ﬂights of steps to reach
the ﬁre.

Tom Albert, director of auxiliary
services, said the University has
already installed the new devices in
the Lothrop Street Residence Hall
and in some of the Quad buildings.

“We haven’t begun work in the
Towers yet, but we do expect to be
ﬁnished by the end of the year,”
Albert said.

Albert estimated the cost of the

! rrroject at approximately $7,000 per

dormitories alone.

Albert added that this cost has
already been included in the yearly
budget so there will be no increase
in student housing rates this fall as
a result of the new additions.

Alexander Kaminsky, director of
plant services and building main-
tenance, said. his ofﬁce is awaiting
the ﬁnal rules of the code to be
published before beginning work
on other University buildings. The
code, originally slated to take effect
June 1,, 1978, was recently
extended to the 1981 date.

A plan to establish a central-
ized undergraduate advising center
was proposed at yesterday’s
University Senate Council meeting
by Student Affairs Committee
chairman William Lenaghan.

The proposal calls for an ofﬁce to
coordinate all advising activities
such as training of advisers,
pre~admission counseling, adver-
tising for advising and setting
guidelines for the advising
program.

“We need a network to connect

all advising centers so that students
having questions ranging from
ﬁnancial aid to overseas studies can
make one phone call to ﬁnd the
correct information or referral,”
Lenaghan said.

Student Government Board pres-
ident Josh Baylson lauded the
proposal.

“What we are faced with here at
Pitt is not the lack of information but
rather the overabundance of
information,” Baylson said. “We
need this centralized source of
information and referrals.’ ’

 New Center for Advising Proposed

echoed Baylson’s statement,
adding the ‘new center could
possibly take a workload off
advisers by answering basic
questions concerning registration
and ﬁnancial aid, thus allowing
more time for advising.

The harsh winter and the Pitt
energy situation was another topic
discussed at the meeting. The
subject of the Allegheny County
energy alert and its effect on the
University was discussed by
Chancellor Posvar.

U.S. Working on Aid for Students

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Federal Government is
beginning to work on new forms of
ﬁnancial aid and one of two
programs currently under consider-
ation appears to be headed for
Congressional approval in the near
future.

One proposal, sponsored by
Delaware’s Republican Senator
William Roth Jr., would allow a
minimum tax credit of $250 for each
tuition-paying college student. The
credit would increase to $500 by the
student’s senior year.

In a move to head off the tax

credit bill, President Carter last
week proposed a $1.5 billion
expansion of existing scholarship
and loan programs. Carter said the
tax credit bill would be too
expensive, and too much money
would go to students who don’t
need additional aid.

Under Carter’s proposal “basic
educational opportunity grants”
would be made available for more
students; maximum grants would
rise from $1,600 to $1,800; the
amount of the average grant for

_ students in families 'with incomes

between $8,000 and $16,000 would
rise by $200; more students would

be eligible for Federal1y-guaran-
teed loans, and an estimated
280,000 more work-study jobs
would be created for students.

In making his announcement,
Carter said he‘ would veto a tax
credit bill, warning that he would
not accept both tax credits and
beefed-up existing programs.

However, according to an aide to
Representative William Moorhead,
there is still substantial support in
Congress for tax credits.

William Maloni, special assistant
to Moorhead, said “no one disputes
the fact there is a serious problem.

Bus-Trolley Crash Unexpected

By The Associated Press

PIT'I‘SBURGH—The operator of an 18-ton Port Authority Transit
trolley that abruptly turned left before colliding with a loaded bus
has reportedly said the turn was unexpected.

Four persons on the aluminum and plywood PAT bus were killed
and 28 other passengers injured in Friday’s morning rush-hour

collision on a mass transit expressway in the South Hills section of '

the city.

One member of the team probing the crash said trolley driver
Robert Ray, 40, was interviewed Monday after three days of
intense shock, but PAT’s South Hills superintendent Albert DeBor
yesterday refused further comment.

The Pittsburgh Press, however, reported yesterday that Ray said
he was drifting his trolley through a switch at several miles per
hour when the vehicle abruptly turned left.

Meanwhile, a Pittsburgh commuter testified Monday that
Andrew Petrusky, 55, who died at the wheel of the bus, was teased
on occasion for being a cautious driver.

Lynette D. . Talak, 25, a six-year commuter from suburban
Brooklin, gave that testimony in a civil suit aimed at keeping the
South Busway closed until additional safety equipment is installed.

The investigators at ﬁrst focused on the switch thatguided the
trolley across the path of the on-coming bus. The switch worked
when several trolleys were driven over it after the accident.

“I don’t think he intended to turn,” Mrs. Talak testiﬁed when
asked about the trolley’s movements. She suffered cuts and
bruises in the accident.

The busway remained closed Tuesday as PAT drivers called for

' - speedy installation of $110,000 worth of electronic safety signals

included in the busway design.

Carter Calls for Coal Negotiations

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON-—President Carter called yesterday for striking
miners and the coal industry to resume negotiations at the White
House “to end the present stalemate.” He said if that does not
produce a settlement he will take “stronger measures.”

“I continue to support the collective bargaining process,
however, the welfare of this country must be my overriding

concern,” said Carter.
“The negotiations at the White House must be viewed as a ﬁnal

opportunity for the bargaining process to work,” Carter said. “If it

i does not, Iwill have no choice but to resort to stronger measures.”

Asked at the conclusion of his stalemate if the stronger measures
would include invoking the Taft-Hartley Act to order the striking
miners back to work, Carter said it would be “one of my options.”

It was the only question Carter permitted.

World Population Growth Declining

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The rate of the world's population growth has
unexpectedly peaked and is now actually declining, according to
reports from population experts yesterday.

The decline was attributed mainly to “a sizable and generally
unexpected decline in fertility in the poor countries of the world,”
according to Nick Eberstadt, an associate at the Harvard Center for
Population Studies.

“This fertility decline is good news for the world—-especially the

I’

 poor world,” Eberstadt told the annual meeting of the American

Association for the Avancement of Science.

Eberstadt reported that the rate of world population growth had
reached a peak of 1.9 percent per year “somewhere around 1970”
and was down to 1.7 percent in 1977.

“The drop in fertility means that world population will stabilize
sooner and at a lower level than previously expected,” according to
the Eberstadt report.

By the year 2000, Eberstadt said, the world's population may
rise from its present 4.1lbillion to between 5.5 billion and 5.8
billion. Previous United Nations population projections estimated
the world’s population for that year of 6.5 billion.

 Jury Investigates Gas Purchase

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—A federal grand jury is reportedly investigating
allegations that Equitable Gas Co. of Pittsburgh bought natural
gas that had been stolen from its lines.

The U.S. Attorney’s office Monday conﬁrmed that a criminal
investigation is under way as a result of a civil complaint Equitable
ﬁled against Waco Oil and Gas Co. of Glenville, W. Va., an
Equitable supplier.

“We were, in effect, buying our own gas back,” Walter B.
Rogers, an Equitable spokesman, said here Monday.

The suit alleges that the sham occurred over several years at
Waco wells in Braxton and Gilmer counties in central West
Virginia.

Rogers said the value of the fuel has not been determined,

 ‘although Equitable has sued for more than $10,000. .

The suit says Waco illegally tapped Equitable lines and stored
the gas for future sale to the Pittsburgh-based utility.

The ﬁre safety devices are

before June 1, 1975, including the
Law Building and the new nurses

Kaminsky estimated the total

$300,000.

NewgFederal Aid Proposed

(Continued from Page I)
It is "a question of how that problem
is best answered.”

Maloni explained that Moorhead
is “supportive” of the Carter
proposal, but the Congressman has
not yet “thrashed out” the details.

“It’s not a matter of being for or
against either bill. We have to ask
which is more equitable,” Maloni
said.

“But the tax credit bill,” he
added, “would create a $4-billion
drain on the treasury. It also has a
hooker attached that would make
families with students in private
high schools eligible for tax credits.

“At any rate,” Maloni continued,
“we have to keep in mind that any
form of additional aid to college
students gives the schools carte
blanche to raise their prices.”

Maloni also said some form of
ﬁnancial aid bill will probably move
through Congress in time to help
students this fall. A

Pitt’s director of student aid,

Frank Dutkovich, said Carter's
proposal, if passed, would help
most Pitt students, especially those
from middle income families “who
need it most.”

Dutkovich said about 4,000 Pitt
students now receive basic grants,

and about 6,000 students have
Federally-guaranteed loans.

He also said that a considerable
number of Pitt students not now
eligible for grants and loans would
qualify under the program proposed
by Carter. _

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Another Bummer

As a result of yesterday’s Board of Trustees decision to raise
tuition 7.6 percent, Pitt undergraduates will be paying an ad-
ditional $3 per credit this spring and an additional $50 per term
beginning in September. So far.

If the University fails to wrest considerably more from the
Legislature than’ the $60.5 million recommended by Governor
Shapp for this year, tuition hikes could be even further increased
before fall. Undergraduates (and the situation is even worse for
graduate and professional students) have been hit with tuition hikes
to the tune of 15.6 percent since the 1977-78 academic year began.
By September, the numbers could be in the 20 to 25 percent range.

While we, as presumably rational agents, can hardly bring our-
selves to support a tuition hike, it is difficult to work up the
rhetoric to condemn it. The increase has been a foregone con-
clusion for a number of months now—an unhappy circumstance
for which students themselves are largely responsible.

The inability of students to act as a political force is recognized
everywhere from the Chancellor’s office to the Governor’s man-
sion. Despite the fact that the student population in Pennsylvania is
rather large, and despite the fact that nearly every student has legal
access to the voting booth, lawmakers pay no more attention to
student needs than they pay to turnpike speed limits. The reasons
for this are obvious and oft—repeated. 0

Had the trustees not raised tuition now, further debts would have
been incurred that might have resulted in an even larger increase in
the fall. There are those who would have had ‘the University con-
tinue operating at a deficit rather than raise tuition—using that
deficit as a platform from which .to practice “confrontation
pol_itics” on the Legislature—but we doubt that anything would
have been accomplished via those tactics. It has already been
established that as long as the University (i.e., the student, parent,
faculty and staff population) remains politically impotent, the
legislators will remain immune to confrontation from this quarter.

One of the hoped-for results of yesterday’s tuition hike is that it
will somehow politicize students and their parents-—somehow
motivate them to make their displeasure known in Harrisburg in
suen '3 way as I6 make the Legislature raise this year’s ap-
propriation. ‘ —

Unfortunately, history says those hopes will likely go unrealized.
Tuition here has been increasing steadily—-and steeply-—almost as
long as anyone can remember. Thus far, students and their parents

have consistently taken it on the chin, consistently absorbed the
blow, and consistently allow-ed themselvesto be hammered again.

It does, of course, have to stop somewhere. A conscious choice
must be made sooner or later. That choice has to do with whether
we stand up to the trustees in opposition to tuition hikes, or to the
legislators, in opposition to the declining priority given to higher
education.

Given the University community's vested interest in quality
education—and assuming that Pitt does not grossly _misspend the
money it does have——it would seem that the Legislature would be
thebest place to begin.

Today the ad hoc Student Government Board Task Force on
Higher Education will most likely be voted in as a new standing
committee, the Public Affairs/Governmental Relations Commit-
tee. Perhaps an effective student lobbying organization will emerge
from there. It is, at least, a start. I

But a new SGB committee will be just another legislative joke
unless students and other persons interested in tuition costs are
somehow impressed with the need to take an informed, vocal and
voting interest in what goes on in Harrisburg.

Otherwise, we might as well all transfer to Harvard. Tuitions will
soon be comparable, and we might even get a little respect, whether
we deserve it or not.

Letters to the Editor

Pretzels and the Joy of Contortions

Thank you for the article about
Narendra Rathore. Having studied
hatha yoga (not ratha yoga-
Narendra is well known in
Pittsburgh and elsewhere, but I
doubt if this is sufficient for his
having a type of yoga named for
him) with Narendra for the past two
years, I find him to be the most

dedicated teacher I have ever
known.

Narendra carries with him the
kind of humility that I suspect
resulted in your showing, not a
picture of him, but of a student, in
the article. When he helps you to
contort into a pretzel, he moves your
body into positions you never

Making Education

By R. DAVID TIVE

One normally expects a year ti)
last 12 months. Even a ﬁscal year.
That's why it seems to be so
shocking that it is state budget time
again. How can they already be
doing next year’s budget when we
just received money from this year’ s
budget a little over a month ago?

Yes, as depressing as it may be, it
is once again budget time in
Pennsylvania, or, as it has become
known in higher education circles,
“Run for Your Life. ’ ’ If you thought
things were’ tense last year, just
wait until you see what the
legislative version of “Perils of
Pitt” brings us in this episode.

The story is the same, but _the
numbers have changed. Some of the
numbers that is. One new number is
$70.9 million. That’s the amount
Pitt requested from the state for
next year. An old number is $60.9
million, the amount Pitt actually
received from the state this year,
and the amount Governor Shapp
has recommended we get next year.
There is another new number, $10.4
million, which has been earmarked
by Shapp and Secretary of
Education Caryl Kline to be used to
build an animal care facility at
Scaife Hall, for the experimental
animals used by the medical school.

Not only are some of the numbers
the same, but most of the people are
still the same. Governor Shapp still
is there, as are» Thomas Nolan,
Henry Hager and James Mander-
ino, the former senate majority
leader, current senate minority
leader and current house majority
leader, respectively.

A couple of people are gone. One
is Buddy Cianfrani, who, whatever
else he is. was often a friend of
higher education. Another is Bob
Butera, former house minority
leader, who is running for governor
and is therefore portraying himself
as everybody’s friend, a trick of
political sleight-of-hand accom-
plished only by completely ignoring

es" ’

several years of legislative history.

So similar is this year’s budget to
that of last year (one month ago),
that even the quotes are the same.
Chancellor Posvar is once again
saying tuition hikes are inevitable-
which is .an obvious conclusion-
and the people of Pennsylvania
don’t want to see higher education
crippled, a conclusion of doubtful
validity. Student Government
Board president Josh Baylson is
bemoaning the situation of students
being used as political pawns, the
same statement that his pred-
ecessor, Bernie Payne, made many
times last fall. And legislators from
all across the state are dusting off
last year’s press releases about the
necessity of reducing state spend-

ing while still providing for the

needs of the citizens, which is
20th-century America’s peculiar
version of having its cake and eating
it too.

, There is one major difference
.between last year and this year.
Last year, the nature and level of the
state commitment to higher -edu-

cation was never really the issue.

The real issue was cowardice, the
cowardice of the legislators to do the
right thing and raise taxes even if it
hurt a couple of them politically.
-This time, there is ample
opportunity to get the debate
centered on the issue of higher
education. It will, however, take
some effort and initiative on the part
of the schools involved. Last year,
they reacted to a threat that
presented itself, but never suc-
ceeded in making it ‘the most
important issue. If they act quickly
now, they can grab center stage and
force the debate to revolve around
them, not around some phony issue
like a tax hike. It is reassuring to see
Posvar and the heads of the other
universities being so outspoken so
early. Blunt talk and a certain
amount of aggressiveness are
needed to insure that the budget
battle is fought on our turf, in the
arena of a commitment to providing

thought possible, and yet there is no
pain.

One more thing—Narendra is
consistently joyful, a state of mind
which, unfortunately, many of us
experience all too rarely.

quality post-secondary education.
Any strategy has its drawbacks,__

and this one does also. If we expect 4

a high priority for higher education
from the state, we have to be
willing, and able, to demonstrate
our own high level of commitment to
providing education for students.
That demonstration, and in many
cases that commitment, are sadly
lacking or non-existent.

What I am saying is that we must
have our own house in order before
we can cast stones at the Legislature
for trying to tear that house down.
For example, it would seem to take a
fairly high level of hypocrisy for Pitt
to protest being unable to provide
quality education and yet still
accept $10.4 million to build a,

facility to care for experimentfig

animals. If the administration is ‘

really serious about the threat
Shapp’s budget presents to educa-
tion, it would ask the Legislature to
take that extra $10.4 million and add
it to the general appropriation of
$60.5 million. That would bring the
total remarkably close to the $70.9
million figure Pitt initially
requested, and would make life
much easier for both the adminis-
tration and the students.
The quality of education provided___,

to students in Pennsylvania has 

become the main budget issue. If it
doesn’t, we will be nickle-and-
dimed to death in a few short years.
If it does, we will either clearly win
or clearly lose. If we win, we will all
be better off. If we lose, at least we
will know where we stand and can
all start looking for other schools or
states to transfer to.

But we cannot expect more from
the state than we are willing to give
ourselves. If we want a commitment
to higher education from them, we
must demonstrate our own. The

moment the people in Harrisbur A V 1”

get a hint that the universities’ ‘

administrative commitment to
quality education is less than
absolute, they will, justiﬁably, cut
us off cold.

By PATSY GOVERT

Are the winter blues beginning
to get you down? Do you ﬁnd
yourself wistfully looking for a
sprig of green, so you can pretend
that spring is near? It may be time
to start planning your summer.
Having something tg look forward
to may ease the tension of hitting
another pothole the size of a West
Virginia strip mine, or of waiting
two hours in the snow for a bus that

A is too full to ingest you into" its

warm belly.

There will be the usual
swimming, picnics, family reunions
andtennis, of course, but you may
be looking for something new. It
should be something out of the
ordinary, something possibly chal'-
lenging. Most of all, it should
provide an excuse to get out of this
concrete pit we call civilization.
Camping ﬁts the bill perfectly.

There are, of course, many
different kinds of camping. You can
park a trailer or pitch a tent at

- family campgrounds complete with

hot showers and junk food stores.
One of the hazards of such places is
that you never know when you will
be kept up all night by loud radios,
ﬁghts or crying children.

—_—j‘

«J.

It is possible to ﬁnd camp-
grounds that have nice walking
trails, so you feel like you are
actually out in the woods, but this
kind of camping does not provide
much of a personal challenge.

If you really want to get away
from it all, go backpacking. For
those who have not yet experienced
the joys of tired feet, walking in the
rain, gorp and marauding bears,
perhaps it is time to investigate this
rapidly growing sport. You will see
and hear things that very few
people are privileged to experi-
ence, and youwill gain a new
respect for yourself and what you
can accomplish.

You do not have to be Bruce
Jenner to be able to withstand the
rigors of backpacking; if you can
walk, and do not have an extremely
weak back, you can backpack. You
plan your backpacking trip your-

self, making it as demanding or’

relaxing as you wish.

If you want to cover a lot of
terrain, it can be hard work, but the
sore muscles and bland food pale
when compared to the good
experiences.

On a trip to the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park last
summer, my husband and I had our

sBackpackers 0 Plan Escape Fr

ﬁll of tough climbs, but I will long
remember that vacation as the
most relaxing_of my life. We saw an
80-foot waterfall tumbling down
the side of a mountain, so cold and
clean we could drink from it with no
concern about contamination. We
also saw a small group of pileated
woodpeckers—huge birds whose
search for insects in the bark of
trees sent a thunderous noise
through the forest.

Even more thunderous than that
noise was the quiet. We saw few
people, and were not besieged by
the roar or smell of an engine for
almost a week. Life was simple;
nothing to worry about but putting
one foot in front of the other.

The wildﬂowers, the views and
the mountain streams are more
special when you have worked to
see them, as more and more people
are discovering. The number of
backpackers has increased drasti-
cally in recent years, necessitating
the opening of many new trails.
More people than ever are enjoying
America’s remaining wilderness.

There are bad side effects from
this boom. The cost of equipment

~ has skyrocketed. However, good

quality equipment at reasonable
rates still is available; if you drop
appropriate hints, you can outﬁt
yourself via Christmas and birth-
day gifts.

Do not buy higher quality
equipment than you need. For
example, you do not need a
sleeping bag for temperatures of 20
degrees below zero if you plan to do
only summer camping.

There are several good mail
order companies, such as Recrea-
tional Equipment, Inc. and Eastern
Mountain Sports, which offer
quality equipment at about the best
rates to be found. Do-it-yourself
kits are available through ﬁrms
such as Frostline, Inc., whose
high-quality merchandise and rea-
sonable rates make it well worth
the effort to sew your own tent,
sleeping bag or down vest. There

are local stores specializing in
outdoor equipment, where prices
and quality are both high.

Perhaps the most tragic result of
backpacking's newfound popularity
is the toll it is taking on our
wilderness trails. As more people
use the trails each year, an
increasing amount of garbage and
destruction is left behind. One tin
can or granola bar wrapper may
seem insigniﬁcant. but, multiplied
by 100 hikers, a trail is devoid of its
natural beauty.

If you are serious. about
backpacking, observe a few rules in
order to leave the trail as you
found it. First, if you can pack it in,
you can pack it out. Carry a
garbage bag in your pack. After
meals, simply put all your paper
and cans in the bag, and take it
with you. It won’t weigh much; you
have eaten the heavy part. Do not
bury your garbage, thinking it will
decompose. Animals will smell it
and dig it right back up.

om Winter Blahs

Second. don't wash your dishes
or yourself in streams. lakes and
rivers. Never dump food or soap in
these bodies of water; others may
depend on it as a source of their
drinking water. Take a pot or
canteen of water away from the
source for cleaning.

Third, try to avoid having a ﬁre
every evening. There are dozens of
small stoves available that will cook
food more quickly, and a ﬂashlight
or candle lantern will keep the
bogeyman away quite nicely. There
is not enough wood for everyone to
indulge in the luxury of a ﬁre; the
soil on the forest floor cannot be
replenished if there is nothing to
decompose.

If you are willing to follow a few
rules, and do a little hard work,
backpacking may be what you are
looking for. Next winter, you can
reminisce and plan new trips, while
you wait for that lousy bus.
Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst of a
two-part series on backpacking.

Persistance Won’t Pay For Lone Bowling Fan

-By.JOHN RIGHETTI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Last year, 40,000 football fans
ﬁlled Pitt Stadium on fall Saturdays,
screaming at the top of their lungs.
The band was playing, the shakers

, I -re going, the booze was ﬂowing.

' Three-thousand basketball fans.
sat in the Field House, sweating,
cheering, and following the game
with quick-moving eyes.

A Pitt bowling fan sat on the
sidelines, of the Strand Lanes on
Forbes Avenue, waiting, watching,
and silent.

One fan.

Kurt Sipple, a sophomore
majoring in medical technology,
composed probably the smallest
following of any Pitt sport. Unlike

.otball or basketball fans, whose
A “ ain reason for attending sports

events is a deep interest in the
Sipple’s reason was

game,
different.

‘ ‘I went because a team member,
a friend of mine, asked me to go,” _

Sipple said. “I was curious to see
how a college match was con-
ducted.”

Sipple was not always the only
Pitt bowling team fan. A young
woman attended a few matches to
see her boyfriend bowl, but she
hasn’t been at a bowling match in a
year.

Although Sipple was the Pitt
bowling team’s remaining fan, he
wasn’t always alone at the matches.

“Sometimes we’ve had as many
as five people attend home
matches," said Stephen Fendler,
co-captain of the 11-man team.
“Unfortunately, most of them were
people who were working or
bowling at the Strand, and stopped
to watch. There was no tremendous
fan support.”

The low attendence at bowling
matches has one cause, according to
Fendler. “I don’t think the vast
majority of Pitt students or faculty
know there’s a bowling team,” he
said.

Bowling does not receive the
publicity of football and basketball,
and is not even as well-publicized as
the less popular track or gym-
nastics.

“We can’t advertise our
matches, like other sports, because
we’ve got no money to do it with-,”
said Fendler. “We were partially
funded by the Resident Student
Association last year, but we no
longer receive funding because
we’ve permitted non-residents to
join the team. We just aren’t
funded.”

The lack of funds creates a
difﬁcult atmosphere for the bowling
team, both in and out of matches.

“We have to provide our own
transportation to the away matches
(two cars owned by individual team
members), and pay for our games
and our practice sessions at the
lanes,” said Fendler. .“We even
‘had to buy our own Pitt bowling
shirts.”

Sipple admitted the lack of

uniforms was a problem. “Last
year, with almost no funding, the
team didn’t even have bowling
shirts until late in the season,” he
said. “All the teams they played
against did, and I think this
disheartened them a bit. They never
had the spirit the other teams did. ’ ’

When fans aren’t there to cheer 3.
team on, a team~must boost its own
morale. The bowling team does all
its own cheering, but this is not
enough.

“We’d appreciate the support of
fans, especially at home. It’s really
noticeable when you go away, and
see the support other teams have,”
said Fendler. “When we bowled in
Latrobe against St. Vincent’s
College, about 55 people turned out
to support them. That’s support.”

The psychological help of fan
support cannot easily be disputed.
Last year, Pitt won only 15 of 70
points in its matches. St. Vincent’s
College snatched to division
championship.

Although it lacks athletic depart-
ment funding, the; bowling team
hasn’t stopped. It has applied this
ypar for Student Government
funding, and is awaiting an SGB
decision. ,

Interest in bowling is growing,
this year, the team held tryouts for
three days, attracting 28 hopefuls.
With the addition of six newcomers,
the team drastically has improved.
Its current record stands at 20
points out of a possible 56, with two
matches remaining. Team mem-
bers also boast higher scores; at a
recent tournament in Beaver

‘ County, the ﬁrst team ﬁnished

seventh out of 20 teams, scoring
1,007 pins in one game.

But the fan situation still is bad.

Kurt Sipple has stopped attend-
ing bowling team matches. '

‘ ‘I didn’t start following the team
this year, because I didn’t know
whether there would be a team or
not,” he said.

  U WU Plans Arts Festival

By MARTHAH. GARVEY
pm News sum Writer

The feminist movement has
just celebrated its 10th birthday,
but the Undergraduate Women’s
Union (UWU) has just been reborn.

Last year, UWU suffered the
inevitable problem of any student
organization: graduation. Most
UWU members were seniors, so
UWU was left with a name, a
constitution and a small operating
budget.

UWU was reformed at a planning
meeting of the women’s studies
program last November. These
students were anxious to have a
feminist organization for under-
graduates; they were told UWU
existed, but that it had no members.

Since November, students have
been meeting to reorganize UWU,
which operates out of the women’s
studies office in the Cathedral of
Learning, and holds its meetings in
the Women’s Center in Bruce Hall.

“We’re hoping for an office when
we reapply for funding next year,”
said UWU acting co-chairman Beth
Hohl, “so that students who can't
come to our meetings will have a
chance to find out about UWU.”

Because the membership of
UWU still is small, the group plans
one major project, a women’s
cultural festival at the end of March,
for this term.

“We have to shirk our members’
needs right now,” said Hohl.
“What we're trying to do is spread
the awareness of feminism because
there is so little feminist activity on
campus. It’s a lot of work.”

National Organization for
Women president Ellie Smeal will
speak at the festival, and Marge
Piercy, poet and novelist, will
discuss her work. Gloria Steinem
and Margaret Mead are also being
considered for speaking engage-
ments, but “it depends on our
budget—and their schedules,”
according to UWU co-chairman Nan
Sell.

Feminist-related ‘organizations,
including committee for the ERA
and PAAR (Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape), will have displays
and workshops in the Student Union
during the three-day festival. An
all-day seminar, conducted by
women in male-dominated pro-
fessions, also is being planned.

Women in the arts will be amply
represented at the festival. Fem-
inist musician Willie Tyson will give
a concert, and black artist Faith
Ringold will lecture and show slides
on women artists. Photography and
needlework are also planned
festival exhibits.

“We don’t really have enough
members to do anything other or
more than the cultural festival right
now,” said Hohl. “One of the
purposes of the festival is to
increase our membership, so we can
diversify and offer more to the
University community.”

“We are open to all undergrad-
uates—in fact, we welcome every-
one,” said Sell. “UWU has no
speciﬁc political platform, but we
have the potential to be used as a
sounding board.

“We need to get together and
find alternatives to the system,”
Sell continued. “Students can do
that through UWU.”

With those words typed on her

Judy Chimp snoozed peacefully as
her station wagon carried her to the
New York Hospital.

hepatitis B vaccine at the New York
Blood Center’s Vilab II project at
the Liberian Institute of Biomedical
Research near Monrovia.

But last November, her handler
noticed that her mouth was
swollen, and the condition was
worsened. Doctors believe she has
a rare form of juvenile paget’s
disease, a low-grade cancer.

It is not painful. but both jaws
and gums are severly distended.
She cannot close her mouth and
must be coaxed to eat.

“She is a very key element in our
rcsearch. and without the surgery
she will live only a few weeks. She
will starve to death." said Dr.
Alfred M. Prince. director of Vilab
II and head of the Laboratory of
Virology at the New York Blood
Center.

Judy and four other chimps were
immunized almost two years ago
with the Purcell-Gerin N.I.H.
Hepatitis B vaccine. In July, they
will be inoculated with the live
virus. ,

“If she resists the challenge, she
will tell us that the immunity lasts
for two years,” Prince said. 
added that her chances of surviva 
are excellent because at worst, she I
would only develop a mild form of
the disease.

Afterward, Judy, who was
captured in a forest, will be
released to frolic on a breeding
island in Liberia.

‘Medal of Honor”
Vietnam V

By JOHNRIGHETTI

Pittsburgh Public Theater’s
“Medal of Honor Rag,” being
performed alternately with “Slow
Dance on the Killing Ground” until
March S, remembers something
America wants to forget: Vietnam.

It remembers that aspect of
Vietnam we cannot forget, no
matter how hard we try—the
psychological damage that haunts
so many of its veterans. This is the
essence of “Medal of Honor Rag.”

. The basic plot is one familiar to
many Americans. It is not one that’s
new, nor does playwright Tom Cole
treat it in any new way. But it is
enlightening, or should we say,
devastating.

In “Medal ofHonor Rag,” D.J., a
black Congressional Medal of
Honor recipient, encounters a
doctor in the psychiatric ward of
Valley Forge Army Hospital. The
doctor is the supposed miracleman
with the elixir to cure all; bad
dreams, hallucinations and psycho-
logical hysteria. D..I . slowly reveals
all the wounds of Vietnam and the

war. Not only has he seen the
slaughter of innocent Vietnamese
children, he has also witnessed all
his buddies destroyed in a tank
explosion from which he miracu-
lously escaped. He reveals these
through exposition, hallucination
and pitiful regression. He bears
self-inﬂicted guilt: He survived
when all his friends did not. This
guilt hangs above him physically in
the form of three enormous medals
shown dangling about the stage.

“Medal of Honor Rags’
strength lies in the acting, which is
emphasized in this theater-in-the-
round production by keeping props,
makeup and lighting to a minimum.

Robert Nichols is controlled,
patient and determined in the role
of the doctor. Nichols does an
excellent job of storing up the
doctor’s inner feelings that burst
forth ﬁnally in a poignant emotional
monologue.

Damien Leake is superb as D.J.
His submergedfrustration erupts in
his vivid re-enactments of his war
days. When not fantasizing, he

attacks the psychiatrist, the symbol
of the culture and the war he now
despises. The change is so abrupt,
yet smooth, it leaves the audience
agasp.

Harry O’Toole plays the stereo-
typed military-and-nothing-else
person. But this, too, serves a

purpose. As a symbol of the
military, he expresses its views of
D.J., its now-useless pawn, when
he tells him, “To me, you’re just
another nut.”

Through dialogue, the play
touches on almost every experience
of the returning Vietnam veteran:

et Loses Battle Against Apathy

the attitudes of the young and old,
the unheralded return and the sad
job situation. Unfortunately, it does
not delve into each, but emphasizes
the attitudes. It describes the
attitudes of the Vietnamese towards
the American soldier and the
feelings of the yocal youth culture,
and the disgusted patriots. All these
tug at D.J. and, coupled with
comparisons of the heroes’ ticker-
tape welcome of World War II and
the apathetic reaction to the return
of the Vietnam veteran destroy him,
first mentally, then physically.

Since “Medal of Honor Rag”
deals with such an emotionally
draining subject, the bits of comic
relief after each intense scene are
most welcome. They lighten a
burden that might otherwise have
proved too heavy for the audience to
bear. _

Overall, “Medal of Honor Rag”
does a good job of revealing that
part of war we rarely face—its long,
long, lasting effects. In some cases,
they are not eraseable.

Kenny Rankin and Steve Goodman Soothe

Kenny Rankin appeared last Saturday night with Steve Goodman at Carnegie

Music Hall.

By D.F. MAY

Steve Goodman came out on
stage in sneakers, jeans, a worn
jacket, and a shirt, he later told the
audience, he'd kept around be-
cause he knew eventually it would
come back into style. This was
Saturday night at Carnegie Music
Hall; it was a sold-out performance
for Kenny Rankin and Steve
Goodman.

Goodman gets excited when he’s
singing——shaking his head and his
guitar, shuffling around, and
throwing in a few can-can steps. He
reminds you of the little kid who
couldn’t tap-dance at all but had
everybody laughing at the talent
show because his steps were funny.
Most of his songs are slyly
humorous, like John Prine’s lyrical
assessments of life in “The Big
Padded Cell.” Prine and Goodman
are musical brothers; they’ve
worked together and collaborated
on songs. Steve Goodman per-
formed several Prine tunes the
other night. '

Fortunately, their musical kin-
ship ends with their guitar playing.
Prine is a minimal player, but Steve
Goodman is an adept guitarist. His
playing runs through all the
ﬂat-pick folk styles, and there are

many well-executed single-note
run and chord solos. But the song is
paramount. Whether it is a

ABC: TV’s McDonald ’s

By JIM FARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer
ABC is to television what
McDonald’s is to the restaurant
business. Both serve junk, adver-
tise it as delectable and enjoy
astronomical sales. Both take

advantage of some weak spot in I

American life in the name of
making millions.

McDonald’s exploits the typical
American syndrome of having little
money and even less time to spend
it. We wouldn’t wolf down those
hamburgers and shakes had we the
money to get a’ better meal

 A elsewhere.

ABC’s exploitation‘ is not much

 different. Instead of_ capitalizing on
; our.ia_'<.‘k'of time and money, ABC
takes advantage of how dumb and

foolish some Americans have
become.

Prime time programs on ABC are
designed for those television
viewers susceptible to lapsing back
into an adolescent mentality.
ABC’s viewer is a silly, giggily

person who goes into hysterics at
the most trite sexual innuendos,
but can just as well be brought to
tears by an excessive dramatization
of “real life” situation.

This says much about how ABC
programmers view the prospective
audience—minds as deep as the
pencil impressions on the TV Guide
crossword; television junkies as
easily amused as a dog with a bell
tied on’ his tail.

If shows like “Welcome Back
Kotter,” “Charlie’s Angels,”
“The Six Million Dollar Man.”
‘ ‘Operation Petticoat, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Laverne
And Shirley,” “Three's Com-
pany,” “The Love Boat,” “What’s
Happening,’ ’ ‘ ‘ Fantasay Island, ’ ’
“Soap” and “Happy Days” were
scattered over the three networks,
perhaps there would be no need for
alarm. But it seems ABC alone is
trying to transform prime-time
television into the Saturday morn-
ing cartoons by cornering the
market on such shows. If .ABC’s
programming was used torguage

how sophisticated contemporary
American society is, anthropolo-
gists might begin studying Cro-
Magnon man in an effort to learn
something about how to be
civilized.

What makes these shows parti-
cularly bad is their total lack of
substance. A favority ABC formula
employed in shows like “Happy
Days," and “Welcome Back
Kotter” emphasizes light, simple
plots while grossly exaggerating
the importance of the characters.
What the formula yields is a
non-story with jokes that emerge in
the dialogue forming the core of the

A show. Who needsja story line when
you can have Fonzie snap his
ﬁngers and call Mr. Cunningham a
nerd?

This new kind of TV show
demands little from the viewer in
terms of active (or passive) mental
participation. Watching ABC situa-
tion comedy is as easy on the
cerebellum as breeing through the

(Continued on Page 11)

poignant melody about an old
Dutch sea captain fading into
senility or the “Chicken Cordon
Blues” (one man's beef against his
old lady’s health food regime), the
song—-the story—is communi-
cated.

Unusual events seem to occur
when Goodman steps on stage.
Guitar straps come off in mid-song
and refuse to go back on for two
tries. But some kind of chemistry is
working for him and an atmosphere
is created, rather than one
disturbed.

And when the funny man ﬁnally
sings a serious song, the audience
listens even more intently. When
Steve Goodman came back for an
encore, he sang a song for his dead
father, “My Old Man.” And you
could almost, yes, hear a pin drop.

Kenny Rankin opened his set
with “While My Guitar Gently
Weeps.” A wall of applause met
this tune. Rankin fans are sure of
what they hear, and they love it.
Accompanying himself on classical
guitar and some piano, Rankin was
joined by a bassist and a drummer,
notably Roy McCurdy, long-time
sideman to the late Cannonball
Adderly. McCurdy played impec-
cably with brushes and sticks on
almost all of Rankin’s numbers.
The bassist, whose name regret-
tably could not be heard, was solid
and unobtrusive.

Any statement about Kenny
Rankin would be incomplete
without the word “mellow.” But
using the word gives rise to visions
of banality, and Rankin is not
banal. His voice is excellent. He
favors a falsetto and those notes
are fatter and richer than most
singers’ normal ‘ranges.

Kenny Rankin performed mostly
other people’s tunes on Saturday.
His arrangements of Beatles’
tunes, are ﬁlled with rich chord
progressions and melodic twists.
Rankin is one of the few people who
can play these tunes without the

sought to examine reasons for some

held at the Civic Arena. Findings of
the committee showed many faculty

reported they do not own the

“We’re being persuaded to take the

lained. “But the budget is chewed
up by mandated increases such as
welfare and transportation. They
can’t give us more money. There
has to be some vigorous changing of
that policy. Why can’t the
government agree that that should
be so?”

“The public has to become
aroused. The gubernatorial candi-
dates must be convinced the public
no longer stands for ineffective
government, for not changing the
policy of government. Education is
the best public investment.”

The law, medical and dental

these schools did not receive

“will undoubtedly be necessary.”

Ranked Terrapins Expect to Dine on Pantherette Soup

Sports

By MARY s. HUZINEC

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pantherette basketball squad
meets one of its toughest opponents
of the season tomorrow night, when
it faces seventh-ranked Maryland at
the Civic Arena. The game is a
preliminary to the Pitt-Maryland
men’s game.

“Maryland is an excellent
team,” said Pantherette coach Jean
Balthaser. “They’re probably the
best we’ll face all year, and
certainly the biggest challenge
we’ve had since we played
Tennessee."

The 16-1 Terrapins are expected
to move up in this week’s national

poll after clinching first-place in the
Atlantic Coast Conference Tourna-
ment last weekend. They beat
Duke, Clemson and the nation’s
second ranked team, North Carolina
State, to win the title.

According to Balthaser, Mary-
land is a “well-rounded” team with
a strong bench. All five starters for
the Terps are averaging in double
ﬁgures, including 5-9 freshman
forward Betsy Bailey, (13.6 points

per game) 5-6 senior guard Tara
Heiss, (13.2 points per game). The
Terps top rebounders are Kris
Kirchner with 9.8 rebounds per
game and former Pantherette star
Debbie Jones with 8.8 rebounds per
game.

Jones, known as “Big Red” when
she played for the Pantherettes two
years ago, then averaged 13.9
points and 13.9 rebounds per game.
The Sharpsville native isn't a starter

for the Terps, but may receive a nod
for tomorrow’s game.

Currently the Terps are aver-
aging 90.4 points per game and held
their opponents to 63.8 points. Last
season, Maryland crushed Pitt,
82-53.

“Maryland is a running team,”
said Balthaser. “To win we’ll have
to control the boards and stop them
from running.”

The Pantherettes proved the

effectiveness of their running game

when they upset 10th-ranked St.
Joseph’s Friday night at the Field
House, 77-70.

The 11-9 Pantherettes have two
starters scoring in double figures-—

center Wanda Randolph with 15.6
points per game and guard Debbie
Lewis with 13.6 points per game.
Forward Stephanie Stripling is
averaging 9.2 points, Barb Welsh,
8.8 and Mimi Senkowski 8.7.
Randolph leads Pantherette re-
bounders with 12.9 rebounds per
game.

The Pantherettes are currently
averaging 69.9 points to their
opponents 65.7.

PANTHERETTE NOTES: Soph-
omore guard Kathy Paczkowski still
has a sore ankle and won’t be
dressing for tomorrow’s game...
The rest of the team is healthy...
Randolph has 56 blocked shots on
the season...Lewis is leading the
team in assists with 69.

Cagers A wait A rrival of the King

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer _
Pitt will get a taste of Atlantic

Coast Conference basketball,
Maryland-style, when the Terra-
pins arrive in Pittsburgh to battle
the Panthers tomorrow for an 8
p.m. game at the Civic Arena.

Maryland, also known as the
winner of the Albert King
recruiting war, brings a bundle of
individual talent along with a
surprisingly poor 13-9 record (2-7
in the A.C.C.) for a game
showcasing three of the finest
freshmen players in the country.

Along with King, the Terrapins
also landed Greg Manning from
Steelton, Pa., who starts at a guard
position and is averaging 12.6
points per game. The two
Maryland freshmen,_ as well as
Pitt’s Sam Clancy, took part in last
year’s Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic. _

Senior Lawrence Boston leads
the Terrapins in scoring with a 13.9
average, closely followed by the
six-foot seven-inch King at 13.8,
and sophomore guard Jo.I o Hunter,
11.0. Larry Gibson, Boston and
King control the backboards for
Maryland, hauling in 8.9, 7.0 and
6.8 rebounds, respectively.

“Right now Maryland is playing
as well as they have all year,” said
Pitt coach Tim Grgurich. “In their
last three games, they’ve beaten
Nevada-Las Vegas, lost to North
Carolina by only two points and
then went to South Carolina and

_ beat Clemson.”

The Terrapins started the season
like a house aﬁre, winning the first
nine games on the schedule,
including a victory over 15th-
ranked Georgetown in the Tipoff
Tournament. Since then, dissen-
sion among the stars has reportedly
racked Maryland, and the Terra-
pins’ 4-9 record over the past
month could certainly serve as
evidence.

Pitt will have its work cut out on
the defensive end of the floor
Thursday trying to negate Mary-
land's scoring potential and the
tendency _the Terps have to play
rough under the boards.

    Grapplers Sweep Four Weekend Foes Under

Pitljlﬂews Staff Writer

COLLEGE‘ PARK, Md.--The
Pitt wrestling team won four
matches over the weekend, dump-
ing 10th-ranked Cleveland State
(22-18), William & Mary (22-18),
and Navy (26-18) in a quadrangular
meet at Annapolis Saturday and
downing the Maryland Terrapins
(20-15) in a;_.dual meet Sunday.

“Being realistic, I had hoped we
could come"out of the trip 3-1,”
Panther head coach Dave Adams

basketball team on Thursday
because of the type of basketball
they play in the A.C.C.," Grgurich
said. “We also have to play good
defense; we can't afford to give up
85 to 90 points and expect to win
the basketball game."

The Panthers will stick with the
defensive strategy that has worked
for them throughout the year,
playing a variety of zones,
combinations and man-to-man,
using whatever is working best for
the longest periods.

When Pitt is playing man-to-man
defense,Terry Knight will be given
the job of containing King, and
Clancy and Ed Scheuermann will
matchup with Boston and Gibson.
Larry Harris will be playing a guard
position defensively in an effort to
combat Maryland's height in the
backcourt.

King did not practice Monday
due to back spasms. but has been
given a clean bill of health and
should be in the starting lineup
against the Panthers.

Sophomore Bill Bryant, who had
been a starting guard for the Terps
through the first 18 games of the
season, has been benched in favor
of Hunter. According to the
Maryland Sports Information Of-
fice, Bryant was benched “because
he wasn’t scoring and wasn’t
playing defense."

“We’d like to play Maryland at
our place (Field House), and that’s
a disadvantage, but we have to get
used to playing in the Arena
because that’s where the Eastern
Eight Tournament is held," Grgu-
rich said.

For the King and his court to be
dethroned, Pitt will have to play the
brand of basketball it exhibited
against Syracuse, and avoid the
kind played in its last Arena
appearance.

PANTHER NOTES: Harris needs
91 points to become Pitt's all-time
scoring leader, an average of 15.2
for the rest of the season...Lefty
Driesell has won 178 and lost 70
games since taking over at
Maryland eight years ago...The
next Panther victory will give
Grgurich his most as a head coach.

said. “Even 2-2, I might have been
satisfied. But it seemed like when
someone would let down, someone
else would pick up the load—there
was always someone there to do the
job."

Panther all-America Rande
Stottlemyer (134 pounds) and
190-pounder Bill Bailey were there
in every match, winning all four
bouts they participated in and
earning three pins and 39 team
points between them. But with

starting 142-pounder Mike Bond,

Freshman Sam Clancy has become Pitt's man in the middle.

177-pounder George O’Kom and
150-pounder Ed Bredniak sidelined
with injuries,‘ it was timely wins
that earned Pitt the victories.

“We had our dependables,”
Adams adrnitted, “but the other
guys picked’ up here and there and
helped us to;.win.”

The Panthers took the Eastern
Wrestling League lead with a 3-1
record by upsetting Cleveland,
22-18. Pins by" 118-pounder Glenn
Maxwell (his first collegiate pin)
and Stottlemyer and an unexpected

decision by freshman 142-pound
sub Steve Gouletas (7-2 over Greg
Drenik) gave Pitt an early 15-3
lead.

But losses from the 150-pound to
the 177-pound slot put the Vikings
in front. 18-15, with only two bouts
left.

Bailey (190 pounds) kept Panther
hopes alive with a super decision
over Jack Vanadia, 9-1. Pitt led
19-1,8 entering the heavyweight
division.

slot, awarded when Adams decided
to rest Stepanovich for the
ensuing match with William &
Mary.

Pitt again surged to a 15-3 lead
as Maxwell and Stottlemyer each
earned another pin and 126-pound-
er Jose Martinez decisioned his
Navy opponent Terry Ruddy, 8-5.

The Panthers won three more
individual matches: at 158, where
freshman Tom Jones decisioned
Brain Van Baush (8-4), at 177,
where Jim Gordon decisioned Lon
Yeary (5-1), and at 190, where

The Panthers needed most of

The Indians could have won had

comeback.

Martinez and Stottlemyer were
the only two lightweights to
win—Martinez with a 10-5 decision
over Bruce Davidson and Stottle-
myer with a 9-1 super decision over
touted Bill Pincus.

William & Mary built a 12-7 lead
until the 158-pound match, when
Jones pulled Pitt closer with a 4-1
decision over Gary Drewy.

But the Indians surged ahead,
seemingly for good, when a pin at
167 gave them an 18-10 advantage
with only three classes left.

Gordon won in the clutch with an

88-4 decision over Malcolm Hunter,

keeping the Panthers alive at

I 18-13. Bailey followed with an 11-7

decision over previously unde-
feated 190-pounder Craig Cook,
making the score 18-16 and putting
the pressure on heavyweight
Stepanovich.

But ittook only 34 seconds for
Stepanovich to end the match,

pinning helpless Dale Garner for
the 22-18 conquest.

Tired, the Panthers traveled to
College Park and nearly ruined their
streak against Maryland. But,
down 12-8 after six of 10 bouts, Pitt
scored 12 straight points to insure a
20-15 victory.

Again, Martinez and Stottlemyer
were the‘ only two lightweights to
earn team points—Martinez by
decisioning Terp 126-pounder Mike
Meko 3-2, and Stottlemyer by
super-superior-decisioning Jeff
Armstrong, 14-1.

“They did a hell of a job to win
four this weekend,” Terp head
coach Bill Krouse said. “We
wrestled one of our better
performances—-that win would

Meanwhile, Pitt is going upward,
winning nine of its last 10‘ matches
(an 11-3 mark) and putting its
league lead and chances of national
ranking on the line this Saturday

” Plight of the Pitt Hockey Club-Dime Here, Nickel 1'here

\

It’s enough to make you sit down and cry. '

For five years, members, coaches and players of "

the Pitt Hockey Club have been involved in a futile
battle for survival on our big-time sports-oriented
campus. A combination of University red tape and
administrative apathy has left the club where it star-
ted those many years ago-—-struggling for existance
and hoping for a dime here and a nickel there to con-
tinue operations. Five years of persistance has
resulted in a big, fat nothing.

Things were looking better for a scant moment at
the start of this season, however. Promises from the
top (namely the University Athletic Committee), just
when things were looking at their dismal worst, gave
the club advances it had failed to reach in the past.
Pitt’s hockey future looked bright and club members
had high expectations. They should have known bet-
ter.

Under the direction of president Alex Sanchioli,
the hockey club submitted a proposal to the Univer-
sity Athletic Committee .in October that asked for
" future joint funding by the Athletic Department and
the Student Government Board. Student ‘Govern-
ment had been tlfe sole support for club operations
in the -past, but had previously announced it would be
unable to continue that support. That decision meant
the club’s collapse and spurred the initiative to look
for alternative fundings. _

The proposal called for a three-year trial period,
during which the athletic department would allot
$87,000, while SGB would contribute $7,200 per
year. What the club ultimately was hoping for was
varsity status and full athletic department support.

The University Athletic Committee quickly ap-
pointed a subcommittee (comprised of high Univer-
sity officials and two students) to review the plan and
report back to the full committee. The subcommittee
failed, however, to seek out hockey club members
and review the situation first hand.

“No one made an effort to contact me,” said the

Kclub’s faculty advisor, Dr. Harvey Wolfe. “No one

talked to me, any of the coaches or even any of the
players. What’s the use of having a subcommittee if
its-members don’t talk to the people involved?”

Not surprisingly, -the proposal was rejected in

December because its cost was “really prohibitive at '

this time,” according to the subcommittee. The sub-
committee, promised, however, to help the club

 

search for alternative means of easing its ﬁnancial
burden. Don’t hold your breath waiting for these
“alternative funds” to start coming in by the sackful.

Final result: The Pitt Hockey Club was told “no
funding” for the fifth time, only this trip, it took
three months to say no. That denial could mean
Pitt's hockey days are numbered if the club fails to
find some money, and fast.

According to Pitt athletic director, Cas Myslinski,
a member on that inquisitive subcommittee, the
club’s proposal was rebuked for two main reasons.
The University, for one, he said, is committed to cer-
tain programs, and first on that list of priorities is
women’s athletics.

“We are obligated under Title IX to support
women’s sports,” he said. We have to support
them.”

Maybe first on that list should be an obligation to
give Pittsburgh fans what they want. Even the tout
who’s been burned more times than not at the race

track would bet your average sports fan would rather -

watch a hockey game than a bunch of girls running
around making a mockery of the sport Dr. Naismith

‘ invented back in 1891. And you can bet the Univer-

sity would net lots more gate receipts as well.
The second reason—one that Myslinski has
religiously upheld over the years—is that Pitt doesn’t

have a campus ice facility to work with. Even though’ i

the Civic Arena is only two miles down the road,
Myslinski refuses to budge on the issue. The closest
Pitt can come to having an on-campus rink would
have to emerge from Field House renovation. Don’t
hold your breath on that one, either, as word from
upstairs says the only renovation done to the Field
House would accomodate—you guessed it—the
ladies.

What it all boils down-to is that nobody (of impor-
tance) cares about Pitt Hockey. One of Pitt's few
hockey fans found that out last Friday, when she
called the University ticket office to see where the
Pitt Invitational tournament was to be played. No
one knew there was even a game scheduled.

SGB member Dave Hesidence said it best. “The
Pitt Hockey Club shouldn’t be punished for being as
good as it is,” he said. It is good—a winning
organization that owns a 70-28-5 record. And it is
being punished. The club is forced to go out of state
in order to hire decent officials, officials who know
enough about the game to get out of the way of a
sliding puck along the boards. It’s home-away-from-
home games provide yet another chapter in the
club’s book of frustration. Since it had no funds to
make advance commitments at the Civic Arena this
year, Pitt was forced.to play its home games 30 miles

away in Valencia. The Lake Vue Rink hosts evening .

public skating, and its management makes a point to
end all hockey games in plenty of time to prepare, no
matter what point a game in progress may be in. This
situation resulted in Delaware leaving the Pitt In-
vitational over the weekend, and ruined an otherwise
perfect tournament. .

The Pitt Hockey Club is being punished. And its

members deserve better. It’s enough to make you cry. /

Grappler Reserves Responsible for Weekend Success

ByJIMLEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

COLLEGE PARK, Md.-—No one
who witnessed the Pitt wrestling
team’s four-game sweep of a
quadrangular meet at Navy and a
dual contest at Maryland could
agree on the reasons why the
Panthers, severely hit by injuries
and sickness, were able to win.

‘ ‘They have ﬁve wrestles who are
really hard to beat,” offered
Midshipmen head coach Ed Peery
after his team fell to Pitt, 26-18.
“(Glenn) Maxwell, (Jose) Mar-
tinez, (all-America Rande) Stot-
tlemyer, (Bill) Bailey, and (Mark)
Stepanovich are super—they’re
very tough to beat.”

“The guys that really helped
were the guys that were ﬁlling in for
the starters, ” William & Mary head
coach Ed Steers, whose team
bowed 22-18 to the red-hot
Panthers, decided.

Actually, Pitt had no right to
expect to leave the East Coast with a
2-2 record, much less 4-0. With
starters Mike Bond (142 pounds)
and George O’Kom (177 pounds)
out with rib injuries, with subs Mike
Palko (177 pounds) and Kim Smith
(142 pounds) sick, and with
150-pounder Ed Bredniak separat-
ing his shoulder in a match against
Navy's Paul Supchak, no amount of
juggling by Panther head coach
Dave Adams could completely solve
Pitt’s weak lineup problems.’

And the weaknesses showed.
Many times, as in Pitts 22-18 upset
of 10th-ranked Cleveland State and
22-18 victory over William & Mary,
the Panthers lost the lead after
building up an early advantage. In
Pitt’s 20-15 win over the Maryland
Terrapins, the Panthers could only
win half of the individual bouts.

So how could Pitt steal four
matches away from such strong
competition?

‘‘It seemed like when someone
had a letdown, someone else picked
up the load,” Adams explained.
“There was always someone there
to do the job. Before each match, I
had to take the chart for weigh-ins
and match my wrestlers up against
the other teams’ wrestlers who I
thought my guy had the best chance
to do well. I’ve had more talented
teams, but I’ve never had a group of
guys who stuck together and got the
job done.”

Timely wins were the choice of
the day. Although the Panther
lineup was not the strongest Adams
has had this season (an 11-3 year so
far), and although most of the squad
was forced to compete at different
weight classes than accustomed,
Pitt was still able to defeat four
teams who, by all rights, should
have beaten the unstable Panther
lineup. Observers may not have
been able to ﬁgure why Pitt pulled
off the feat, but the wrestlers
themselves did;

118-pounder Glenn Maxwell
(whose two pins helped Pitt dump
Cleveland State and Navy): “We
won all four because everyone
pulled for everyone else all the time.
When one guy wasn’t doing the job,
someone else picked it up.”

126-pounder Jose Martinez (who ’

had three of four individual wins):
‘ ‘Our backups helped. If they didn’t
push us every day, trying to get into
the lineup, we wouldn’t have as
good a team.”

134-pounder Rande Stottlemyer
(who had four individual wins,
including two pins): “If one guy
didn’t come through, someone else
did.”

142—pounder Steve Gouletas (a
freshman sub whose decision
helped Pitt beat Cleveland State):
“Everybody was picking up where
they could. I felt that if I won that
one match (against Cleveland), that
would make the difference more
than against any other team.”

158-pounder Tom Jones (fresh-
man who won three of four
individual matches): “Everyone
had everything together. When
Glenn (Maxwell) didn’t get a pin,
others picked up the slack.”

177-pounder Jim Gordon (who,

Grappler Glenn Maxwell (118 pounds) recorded two pins.

after being moved up from 167 to
177, won three of four): “If the
usual winners didn’t win, others
picked up. As for myself, I wrestled
a little harder to win.”

190-pounder Bill Bailey (who won
three of four, including a pin): “We
wrestled like a team—if someone
lost, someone behind them picked
up the tempo.”

HWT Mark Stepanovich (whose
pin and decision helped Pitt win two
matches): “Everybody just made a
super effort—there were no comp-
laints from anybody, even though

 

Mudrick photo

people had to lose weight for
matches or wrestle above their
weight.”

Others contributed to the cause-
158-pounder Dick McCaffrey and
134-pounder Jackie Kline had to
compete against foes who out-
weighed them so the ‘Panthers
didn’t have to forfeit any matches,
and 150-pounder Wayne Lawrence
had to lose eight pounds in one
night so Adams could make suitable
lineup changes against Maryland,
but basically, as many witnessed, it
was timely wins that gave Pitt four
victories.

Ferraro ’s Flu Fears Unfounded in Pantherette Victory  

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt diver Cindy Ferraro admit-
ted that she was “scared stiff”
heading into the Pantherette swim
team’s quadrangular meet at
George Washington University in
Washington, D.C. last Saturday.

After spending several days in
bed last week with the ﬂu, the
sophomore from Massachusetts
didn’t know how she would
perform.

“I was really sick on Tuesday
andlwednesday,” Ferraro said. “I
didn’t get to practice until
Thursday. I didn’t think I would do
well.. "

“All I could do was concentrate
on my dives and try not to think
about how sick I really was.”

Flu Epidemic and In juries Continue to Confound

By KAREN KADIKAK
Pitt News Staff Writer . '
According to Pitt diving coach A

Coffey, the ﬂu outbreak gripping
both Pitt swim teams could be more
of a problem than most people
believe.

Coﬁey, who. accompanied the‘

Pantherette swim team to Washing-
ton,’ D.C. quadrangular meet with
George Washington, Sheperd Col-
lege and Townsend State Saturday,

That concentration proved to be
enough as she swept a pair of ﬁrsts
in the one- and three-meter diving
competition in the Pantherettes’
win over Towson State, George
Washington and Sheperd College.

According to Ferraro, it was one
of the best and most consistent
performances of the year. It also
ended up being one of the
outstanding showings for the
ﬂu-weakened Pantherettes (4-4) in
the meet.

‘‘It was our first quadrangular
meet of the season,” Ferraro said.
“I had 11 dives instead of six. I’ve
had a couple meets before where I
ended up with a ﬁrst place, but I
always seemed to have a second or
third to offset it.”

Pitt diving coach A1 Coffey,

reported that “50 percent” of the
women’s team has the bug, while
“one or two” of his divers have
been affected by the illness.

“The ﬂu is a problem,” Coffey
said. “We have a practice schedule
we have to follow, but we haven’t

.been able to follow it very well

becaus_e so many of the kids have
been sick.

‘_‘It’s,a problem everywhere,”
Coffey continued. “I understand

dismayed at seeing the decline in

diving scores among both the men
and women divers during the last
few meets, was also satisﬁed with
Ferraro’s collection of first-place
ﬁnishes.

“Cindy did a great job for us,”
Coffey said. “There was no doubt
about that. The way she came back
after being in bed with a
102-degree temperature last week
is admirable.”

If there was one bleak spot in
Ferraro’s performance, it was her
failure to qualify for the NCAA
diving championships to be held at
Duke University in Durham, N.C.
early next month.

Time after time this season, the
former high school all-America has
barely missed. making the na-

that in the dormitories, a similar
fever and virus is running rampant
among the residents. We haven’t
been able to escape it. We’re just
hoping for a little decent weather so
the kids can recover.”

Coffey said diver Cindy Ferraro,
who helped the Pantherettes win
that quadrangular meet at George
Washington, was in bed with a 102
degree temperature for two days
this past week. Chris Mano, a

First Football Recruits Announced

Today is the ﬁrst day that high
school prospects can sign oﬁicial
letters-of-intent, and seven athletes
have indicated a preference for the
University of Pittsburgh's football
program. »

Ricky Asbury, a six-foot-two
halfback from Canton McKinley
High School, was all-everything in
the state of Ohio last season.

Jim Covert was Pennsylvania’s
number one prospect, and the 6-5,

250-pound tackle from Freedom
High chose Pitt over Kentucky and
Penn State.

The Panthers went .to West
Virginia and came away with the
Mountaineer State’s outstanding
offensive player in Rico Cox, 6-4,
210-pound running back out of
Wheeling Park High School.

Montour I-Iigh’s Danny Daniels, a
6-2, 180-pound quarterback, had
narrowed his choices to Tennessee,

Penn State and Pitt before making
his ﬁnal decision. Daniels is the
brother of former Panther quarter-
back Billy Daniels.

Pitt also landed three more area
prospects in Tim “Yogi” Jones, a
6-2, 220-pound linebacker from
Ringgold; Dave Opfar, a tight end
from South Allegheny who stands
6-4 and weighs 240; and 6-3,
250-pound oﬁensive guard Dean
Gillman‘ fromr Monessen High
School.

tionals. Saturday was no different
for Ferraro as her ﬁnal point total
was five shy of qualifying for a trip
to the nationals.

“A lot of times the judging is
unfair," Ferraro said, “especially
at away meets. “It just depends on
how good the judges score. I’ve
come close to qualifying. I’ve
missed making it by five or 10
points many times. Sometimes, it’s
all a matter of one judge giving you
a higher score.”

Ferraro has one more chance to
qualify this weekend, as the
Pantherettes close out the dual-
meet season at Slippery Rock
Saturday. ,

“I’l1 have more pressure on me
than I did last week when I had the
ﬂu,” Ferraro said. “It would be

freshman on the men’s diving team,
also missed some practice because
of the virus.

“It’s hard to say what will
happen,” Coffey said about the
outbreak. “We’re just hoping for
the best. We’re hoping the kids
recover in time for the Eastern
championships. ’ ’

Other problems with his divers
have caused Coffey to see a decline
in his team’s scoring. Pat Green-
weld, the freshman from Tampa,
Fla. who, along with Scott Winkler
and Mano, has qualiﬁed for the
NCAA pre-qualiﬁers at Penn State
next month, has been hampered
with an injured kneecap.

The flu problem and Greenweld’s
injury have prevented the Panthers
diving team, who have one more
dual meet remaining on its
schedule, from doing any serious
thinking about the Eastern Champ-
ionships to be held in early March at
Trees Pool.

‘‘I know the kids are thinking

nice to make the nationals, but I’m
not going to let the pressure affect
me. The Easterns at Penn State
March 2-4 are more important to
me. Right now, we’re working
towards that.”

If it would guarantee her the type
of performance she had Saturday,
Ferraro probably is one person who
wouldn’t mind having a relapse of
the ﬂu.

“It does get you prepared, even
though it makes you kind of scared
about how you’re going to dive,”
Ferraro said. “I think you get
doubly psyched for the meet when
you arenit feeling well, but i I
wouldn’t want to suffer through the
ﬂu again. No way.”

“But we can’t do too much thinking
about them if we a1-en’t both
