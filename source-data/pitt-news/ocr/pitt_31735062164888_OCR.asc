Student Government’s
Spring Term Projects

(Some of the statements’ in Wednesday's editorial concerning the V

apparent inactivity of Student Government (SG) were based on lack
of information and publicity concerning SG’s activities. Members of
SG have been working on many projects which will be finished in the
fall and winter trimesters, but the work itself was not especially
newsworthy.‘ A summary of ‘.S'G‘s activities follows.)

’ Jerry Hogan,,acting Student Government president, ci-ted some of
SG’S projects and positions during the Spring trimester.’

  

JERRY HOGAN
SG Acting President

Rush Names
Vrana as Aid

Helen Pool Rush, vice-chancel-
lor for student affairs, has ap-
pointed John Vrana,.a June grad-
uate of the University, as her
assistant. He "replaces Frank J.
Callanen. - ‘ ‘ _

Vrana will ' be involved with
accounts for student activities

. and the student allocations com-

mittee, among his other duties as
assistant to the vice-chancellor.

Miss -Rush said’ in praising.

.Vrana that .he was a.‘ versatile
and “afvery capable young man.”

An English major while at the
‘University, Vrana was editor of
the -Pol‘ari_s;‘ business manager of
the Owl; .a member of Pi‘ Delta
Epsilon, honorary journalism frae
ternity; _
sophomore men’-s leadership hon-
orary;' tapped by Druids as
Sophomore Man of the Year;
chosen to the Owl Hall of Fame;

. a member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, senior men’s leadership fra-’

ternity;‘ president of Student Gov-
ernment; and tapped by’ ODK ‘as

I Man of the Year.

. Vrana . will assume his post

Regarding SG’s stand on the

secretary of Druids,-

' I-G es

University’s ﬁnancial _ problem,
Hogan asserted that the “con-
sensus of senators present at the
June 8 SG meetingas sympathetic
towards Chancellor Litchﬁeld in
that the trustees should take

some blame. Several courses of.

action were discussed, but it was
ﬁnally decided that no outward
‘show would effect the trustees’

position. Instead a letter of sup-

port is being sent to the Chan-
cellor in behalf’ of the SG as a
whole.” . - '

The Student ID Card Commit-
tee‘ is presently working on an
all purpose student ID card. The
proposed laminated plastic card,
similar to a gasoline credit card,

will include: -the students name,_

' number,‘ and‘ other‘ pertinant in-
_formation; and the student’s pic-
ture with provisions’ for check-
ing game attendance. The card
will "be used in ' the ili‘6rary“’sys-
tem and validated when the stu-
dent pays his tuition. C
Concerning the cost of the
cards, Hogan stated that it is “es-
sential that the-_ card be. of no
cost at all to students. The logi-
cal place for this money is the
student activities fee,” but this is
not deﬁnite because the commit-

, tee still has to apply for the

money.‘ , . -
SG has _ two members on th
Student Affairs Committee which
is now laying the groundwork
for. distribution of the student
activities fee, -therefore eliminat-
ing much basic work in Septem-
ber. V t ‘ ‘
‘~Hogan met in Harrisburg last
April with six other students
from various Pennsylvania uni‘-
versities in response to resolu-
tions passed by student govern-
ments across the state, recom-
~mending that college text books
and supplies be exempt from

Pennsylvania’s ﬁve per cent sales .

tax. The students presented 2,-
200 signatures on a- petition to
the House Ways and Means Com-
mittee and an additional 10,000
signatures -to Governor William
Scranton. Presently- Dr, Cale.

vice-chancellor for development, -

is pursuing the matter.

By ILENE Ranmowrrz

. “A Berkeley in reverse”
was the way Donald Fried-
man pinpointed the aims "of
"a rally held in support of
Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld. Friedman, undergrad-
uate spokesman for the ‘Stu-
,dents for Litchﬁeld, addressed

600 people, mostly students, who,

gathered for the rally in the

Schenley_'Quadrangle Tuesday .

night.

‘Friedman explained the two-

goals of the rally. The ﬁrst was
A" to express public ttudent sup’-
port for the Chancellor. He stated
that "now is the time for students
to recognize mistakes, but also
to recognize achievements.

students how much they have at
stake. V , V -

Effectiveness Doubted  

By BERN] McLEOD _

' Of a number of students questioned,‘ those-,who attend- '

ed the Tuesday night rally were impressed, though unsure

of what it accomplished. '

. Although few people were around the University on a
warm Thursday night, the opinion sample’ was obtained
from those in the Towers, Schenley Quadrangle, and the Stu-

dent Union lounges. ‘

\ Dan ‘Shaw, Liberal Arts ’66,
was quick in remarking that he
_ enjoyed the rallybecause of"‘the

ﬁne impression it created. It w.as ’

not a Berkley,” he added, “nor‘a
bunch of screaming kids.” In re-
sponse to the question of whether
he thought the rally accomplish-
ed anything, he .responded nega-
tively. “If the Board of Trustees
has‘ decided to get rid of _the
Chancellor, I don't think that a
rally would inﬂuence their "deci-
sion.” ' '

Peggy Herold, a senior in edu-

, cation, also felt that the rally’

was well organized and compli-
mented ‘Donald Friedman, under-

the appropriate times. It was not revealed how many of thesignees and

If the movement is reliable’, there must be more action. If a‘high per-

The ignorance of representatives of the

University’s situation was made even more

evident at the Appropriations Committee
meeting" July 7th from which Dr.‘ Litchﬁeld
was noticeably absent therefore unable to
defend himself. Examining possible sources
of income for the University‘, one represen-
tative asked about T‘the income from the
hotel.” “Webster Hall?” asked GWilym'
Price, chairman of. the Board of Trustees.’
“No, Schenley,” replied the representative.

AN OTHER, REPRESENTATIVE ob-
jected to the beneﬁt of state funds which

' out-of-state students receive by attending

the University. He probably overlooked the
fact that Pennsylvanians attend out-of-
state state-supported institutions or as was
pointed out July 7th, many graduates even-
tually settle in Pittsburgh or Pen-nsylvania.

This naturally brings up the students,
whose opinions have never been brought
into any of the meetings. «Only since Tues.

day has. student opinion been felt. Only ,

time will tell the force of their opinions

since all they really have to do is “know '
V how to meet people.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld gambled when he '

17

joined in the trustees’ commitment “to

achieve the highest possible level of excel- -

lence in briefest ‘possible time.” From an
educator’s_ standpoint he won overwhelm-
ingly; from a businessman’s, he l-ost. Here
is the crux of the problem. The University

cannot belooked upon as solely almsiness ._
venture. As Frank Denton pointed out, the

University is asking for money for opera-
tions which "give no monetary return. Ex.
cellent educations have no price tag or
bankable profits. The state must acknowl-
edge the University’s educational contribu-
tions to Commonwealth citizens without the
distortion of the deﬁcit. Having done this,
it cannot but realize that the "University
must be put back on its feet at any cost and
without any political strings attached. '

Philadelphia Representative Eugene
Gelfand argued that aid at this time sets a
bad precedent for -other private'universit-
ies. Representative Martin Mullen, chair-
man of the Appropriations Committee,
agreed but asked not to abandon the Uni-
versity in the meantime.

Ormaybe we should charge the Com-
monwealth 25 cents per graduating senior.

But if this movement does not serve as an impetus to a fervent cam— r

The rally, ‘petitions, and speeches will then be viewed not as true.

If the movement becomes stagnant, the rally will not serve as a V"

Profits Not Major Aim
Of University Press 0

_ By BERN] McLEOD
« In 1890, when the‘ first

university press was estab- '
lished, at Johns .Hopkins

University, its coordinators

A did not discover a new proﬁt.~
.; _ making venture. Even to-

day, the 70 university press-
es‘ in America, including the

,0 University of Pittsburgh Press,

still operate with a great deal of
-school and foundation support.
Money-making, however, is not
thehprimary .aim. As Frederick
Hetzel, University of Pittsburgh
Press editor-director, stated, “We
‘publish valuable scholarly books

,_ that commercial publishers,‘ hop-
v sing for a proﬁt, cannot.”

~ : The University Press as a pub-

lisher acts to receive and eval-»
uate manuscripts, edit them, su- .

pervise book production, and dis-

. tribute publications. .

 ..When the University Press _ﬁr_st
started ‘operations in 1936, the

V; books were largely of a regional
‘nature and were noticeably dif-

-ferent in appearance and sub-

.ject ‘matter, from ones. published

today. Printed on paper of poor-
er_ quality, with brown paper
gjackets, their lack of appealing
presentation kept sales down for
the small-proﬁt operation.“

’l 0. Toda,y,'books_ published by the
University of Pittsburgh Press
have improved marke-dly in, ap-
pearance, best illustrated by the
fact that The ‘First Biography of
Joan of Arc, translated and an-

«' notated by i D._ Rankin and C.
. _Q_uintel, was selected "by the
~.A‘me_rican Institute of Graphic

Arts as one ‘of 50 most attrac-

r tive-.books. _

associate ‘professor of political

science, dealing with Nationalism _

. ; .Manuscripts published by ' the

University .Press .are often the

product of the best research pro-
. duced in colleges and universi-

ties, but because of the special-

-ized' or technical nature of the
 works, they. do not always have
 mass appeal. ,

vastly increased, in reality these
books mainly serve to facilitate
communication among ﬁeld ex-
perts.” ‘’ ‘ _

Cleveland, stating principles of

pected to sell like Gone with the

If proﬁt were the University
Press’ main objective, it could
not continue to publish books of
scholarly nature, because of_the
general inability of such" works
to draw the sales of four to eight
thousand copies that publishers
need just to break even. ThevUni-
versity Press, however, publishes
the research and ideas of schol-
ars that are too valuable to re-
main unrecorded. ‘ 0'

clarifying the issues. Miss Her-
old, however, felt that the rally
had an accomplishment in show-
ing the public that “Pitt students
appreciate the improvements that.
Chancellor Litchﬁeld has‘ accom-
plished for us.”

'Royce Entner, a junior in Lib-
eral Arts, also agreed that the

that “having Representative Horn-
er attend, showed that it was of
some signiﬁcance.”

Of those questioned, Linda Hal-

pern, Liberal Arts_ ’68, was the-

only one disappointed in, the
rally. She felt that ‘.‘the rally
never got off the ground; it didn't

seem like a rally. There was very '

little enthusiasm. I don’t think
it accomplished anything,” she
added, “except publicity.”

  Trustee Statements of Rally

(Continued from Page 1)

Litchﬁeld was possibly guilty,‘

but so might be the Board of
Trustees. "‘The Board "of Trustees
must exert more ﬁscal control,
but that doesn’t necessitate sacri-
ﬁcing the Chancellor,” ‘he said.
Representative Max Homer,
spoke of two kinds of administra-
tors: the lethargic kind who are
content with the status quo, and
the innovators who are not

afraid to take chances. He thought

Chancellor Litchﬁeld belonged in
the second category, and ' had

- done a tremendous job in the

"last ten years. He said that he
was positive that any mistakes

the Chancellor might have made _

were honest and- in the interests
of the University, Pittsburgh, and
the tri-state area.

Homer continued by expressing
his dissappointment that the
trustees made the statements they
did at the legislative hearings.
He thought and hoped that they
did not mean as much as the
public interpreted them to mean.
He believed_:that Litchﬁeld should
have a_ chance to defend himself,
and expressed hope that, his
“great American dream” will be

~ fullﬁilled. The representative con. .

concluded by saying that he

’.“will do everything to give the

$5 million . . . -or any millions to

keep Pitt on the road to suc-_

cess.”

James , Walsh, ‘ the graduate
spokesman, said that the Board
of Trustees was on a- “witch
hunt,” and the students would
be prostituting their position if
they allowed the Chancellor to be
a scapegoat. He. said, “Blame is
not our concern. We must con-
centrate on the hopes of the
future.”

He pleaded thatan intellectual

atmosphere must prevail if the
University is not to become a

“degree mill.” If the students do-'

not make their voices heard and
desires known, -they might be
“cruciﬁed on a cross of debits and
credits.”
