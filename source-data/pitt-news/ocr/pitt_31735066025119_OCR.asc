Faculty Assembly reviews
Senate term restructuring

By Tara Harris
For T be Pitt News

A proposal for revised
University Senate Council bylaws
was reviewed during yesterday's
Faculty Assembly meeting.

Although there are numerous
changes which differentiate the
new proposal from the present
version, seven major changes
were focused upon.

These major changes include
the way faculty will become
members of Senate Council, term
extensions for certain staff
members and part-time faculty, a
new standing committee, which

will be concerned with non-
discriminatory policies, and the
prohibition of faculty running for
election to more than one
committee simultaneously.

According to the proposed
bylaws, each person from the
Oakland campus elected to a
three-year term on the Faculty
Assembly will spend the last two
years of that term on both the
Senate Council and the Faculty
Assembly.

Some who will receive
extended senate membership
include the chancellor of the
university, eight other admin-
istrative officers who are members

Pi Kappa Phi frat
makes a ‘killing’
for PUSH charity

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

People are dying all over campus as part
of Pi Kappa Phi’s assassin game to raise
money for People Understanding the
Severely Handicapped.

Each “assassin” paid five dollars to join
the competition. Last Thursday the
participants received their assignments
and waterguns after watching a five-minute
presentation about PUSH. The object of
the campus—wide game is for contestants
to drench the persons they are assigned to
kill without being killed.

One of the contestants, Jennifer Brodt,
said, “The presentation was nice. Itshowed
that [PUSH] was important to them. I
wouldn’t have participated in Assassin if it
wasn't for charity. It’s fun, though. More
people should have joined.”

The game will continue until only one
of the 80 participants is still alive. The
survivor will win $50.

This is just one of the fund-raisers that Pi
Kappa Phi holds to raise funds for charity.
Their annual fund-raising events include
the Push-athon, in which they push a
wheel chair around the local area for 24
hours and end with a lap around the
stadium before the Homecoming game.
The brothers also have canning days for
PUSH.

PUSH committee Chairperson Bill
Swisher said, “This is the first of our
upcoming fund-raising events. We’re trying
to do more noticeable events, like Assassin,
a dunking booth and a sidewalk climb to
elevate people’s awareness.”

PUSH was founded in 1978 by Thomas
Sayre, a member of Pi Kappa Phi. The
fraternity has since raised over $5 million
nationally, which is the most any fraternity
has raised for one single charitable
organization.

“So far this year we have raised over
$1,000 toward PUSH,” Swisher ‘said.

Over Spring Break, Pi Kappa Phi brother
Todd Firestone is going to Clemson

of Senate Council, four additional
administrative officers designated
by the chancellor, the deans, all
full-time faculty with the titles of
instructor, assistant professor,
associate professor and professor,
all part-time tenured faculty and
all full-time faculty librarians, as
well as several other individuals
elected by the senate.

The new standing committee
will concentrate on a non-
discriminatory policy, which
will encompass all discrim-
inatory actions affecting
faculty and students, including
sexual harassment and
‘homophobia.

in booster scandal

The three men charged in connection with stealing money
from Pitt's Golden Panther Booster Club will stand trial on
criminal charges after being denied placement in a probationary
program for first-time offenders, according to The Pittsburgh
Press.

Robert Heddleston, Emanuel Perry and L. Keith Fammartino
were charged with stealing more than $146,000 from the the
university's food—service program and from the Golden Panthers,
a booster club and financial-aid program for athletes.

Heddleston, former executive director of the Golden Panther

and one count of criminal conspiracy and theft of services.

puts Oa/eloma’
on the stage

By Lou Moorhead
For The Pitt News

Elvira DiPaolo discussed how
she brought South Oakland’s
Italian—American community to
the stage in her play Bricklayers
during a lecture sponsored by
Pitt's English Club.

Her first try at the Play-writing
profession, Bricklayers was the
first play to be performed at the
new City Theater in the South
Side.

“My mother never saw my
writing as something real until
she saw the play performed at
the City Theater,” DiPaolo said.

DiPaolo said the play reflects
her childhood growing up in the
very ethnic South Oakland section
of Pittsburgh.

“As a writer you write what you
know,” she said.

Oakland is definitely what she
knows. After graduating from St.
Paul’s Cathedral High School she
went on to Pitt, where she earned
a bachelor’s degree in English
writing.

“While everyone was busy
writing up resumes, I was doing
stage-manager work in the second
semester of my senior year,”
DiPaolo said.

Upon graduation, she decided
to take a year off to work before
she started any post-graduate
studies.

“I can remember watching the
Oscars with my father the summer
after I graduated, and the category

of screen writing came up. I .

immediately turned to him and

said, ‘That’s what I want to do,”'

she said. ' .
Two months later DiPaolo’s

father died and she was left to

care for her mother. After applying

Summer film classes offered

By Carol O’Sullivan
For The Pitt News

Filmmaking classes will be
available this summer for the first
time since 1990.

“Summer is the ideal time for
students to take production
courses,” said Lucy Fischer,
director of the program, “because
[students] usually aren’t taking a
full load."

Since the film-studies program
first began offering classes
through Pittsburgh Filmmakers
in the mid-'70s, the summer
selections have been “on-again,
off-again,” Fischer said.

Because credit courses at the
Oakland Avenue location cost
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
money, Dean Peter Koehler
explained that to offer or not to
offer the courses is purely a
budgetary decision. “Last year
things were very bad. I was forced
to cutmanyworthwhile offerings,
including Filmmakers’ classes.”

Enrollment within CAS, FAS
and CGS must be at or above a

minimum before classes can run,
so that the groups will break
even, Koehler said.

“We’re banking on the fact
that we will make our minimum
this summer,” Koehler said. “We
hope to keep it 

Production classes cost the
university close to $300 per
student, setting enrollment limits
each term. This summer the cut-
off is 81 students.

Classes are open to film—studies
majors and non-majors, but they
are limited to students in CAS,
FAS and CGS. “We are hoping
more spaces will be available for
non—majors,” Fischer said,
explaining that classes in the fall
and winter usually fill
immediately with majors.

Courses for the summer term
include Filmmaking I, 2 and 3,
Intro to Videotape Production
and Screenwriters’ Workshop.
Independent Study and
internships are also available.
To sign up, see film-studies’
advisors, Fiore Pugliano and
Linda Orbach, in CL 617.

Tm”/eisb suﬂmge discussed

Doug Callahan
For T be Pitt News

Men did not simply hand rights to women in Turkey, but
instead a long fight earned women these rights, according to
Aysegul Baykan, who spoke yesterday about the women’s
movement in Turkey in the early half of the 20th century.

Baykan, a second-year research associate at Pitt who wrote
her dissertation on the transformation of the Ottoman Empire,
said tracing the history of the women’s movement was no easy
task. The Turkish women’s political party formed in 1923 with
500 initial members. It lasted more than five years and has only
two pages written about it in the Turkish National Library.

Citing a chance discovery in an Oakland second-hand
bookstore, Baykan was able to trace the history of the
movement through the records of its founder.

Baykan said the problem with the historical records of the
Turkish women’s movement is that they were compiled by men
who discounted the significance of a “new social construction
of women based on gender realizations.”

Acknowledging that the majority of the women who
championed the cause of the women’s movement were the
wives of prominent citizens and diplomats, Baykan said she
feels that the efforts of women in gaining their suffrage are
misrepresented. She said she also feels the majority of Turkey’s
historical records depict men as “giving” women their rights.

“Women were not passive beings, sitting there like ducks,

‘Former hippie’ makes the transition to computer prof

By Kim Palmiero
Staﬂ" Writer

He’s a former horse breeder
and successful businessperson, a
traveler, a teacher, a student and
full—time employee at the Software
Engineering Institute. But as he
works toward his doctorate, self-
described “former hippie” Michael
Rissman said he came back to
school “because the teaching is
important to me.”

Rissman, a professor in the
School of Library and Information
Science, is in his second semester
of teaching through a fellowship.
Rissman teaches computer
classes, and this semester he is
teaching Programming Design
and Software Tools.

Rissman said his teaching
experiences have been
enlightening ones. “I’ve
discovered new things about the
information and also about how
I judge people.”

He stressed the importance of
the way material is presented to
students. “My goal is‘ to give my
students a way of organizing
information. My courses are never
going to be, ‘Memorize this, and
regurgitate it.’.One can open up
a textbook and write facts up on
a board, but I don’t consider that
to be teaching. What I want to try
and find is some organizing
concept, so that if the students
understand the concepts they’ll

understand the information,”
Rissman said.

Though Rissman, who hails
from Chicago, said he enjoys
being in school now, it wasn't
always that way. He ﬂunked out
of his first year of the Illinois
Institute of Technology. When
his father convinced the dean to
let him go back, he ﬂunked the
second term, too. Rissman said,
“I was 17 years old and very
immature when I graduated from
high school.”

In 1975, after spending two
years teaching himself about
marketing research by reading
books, Rissman started his own
business and developed the
hobby of breeding and training
thoroughbred horses.

But Rissman said the world of
business did not keep him happy.
“I woke up one morning and
said, ‘I’m bored,’ and I realized
that I didn’t even want to do this
for the rest of the week. So I sold
my company.”

Today he is still in business —

sort of. In addition to taking three ‘

classes and teaching one, Rissman
works ‘on new designs for flight
simulators at SE1. He defended
the work done at SEI andsaid the
technology is important.

“SEI was created to address the
software crisis in the [United
States], and even though we're
associated with the military there’s
no reason that our technology is

only useful to the Department of
Defense," Rissman said.

Rissman said the kind of work
that is done at SEI is important for
the safety of the nation.

“I wish that the world could be
totally disarmed. I think that what
has to happen for the world to
disarm is that someone has to
have a vision as to how we have
to redirect this energy that is
going into the military. I don’t
have that vision, so what I say is
that as long as these military
projects are going to go forward,
they ought to be well-conceived.
Because if they’re not, it just
introduces the possibility of us
blowing ourselves up,” he said.

Rissman once took a freighter
to Australia, where he lived for
six months. '

“Their tourist trade tells you
about the kangaroos and the

you is that they have some of the
meanest insects. I was walking

Rissman said his favorite place is
the American Southwest. “I like
waking up next to the mountains;
it just reminds you of how

Rissman said that although he
can see himself teaching at Pitt
after he gets his doctorate, he has
another dream.

“I’d like to go to a university in
a small town in the Southwest
and live in the mountains and
either ride a horse or a motor-
cycle to work — and to spend my
life opening students’ minds,” he
said.

Greeks receive two awards at Northeast Conference

stag‘ Writer

Pitt’s Greeks took home two awards
from this weekend's Northeast Panhellenic
and Inter-Fraternity Conference.

Pitt’s Inter-Fraternity Council won the
award for publications for their newsletter,
Greek Beat, the rush guide, and the
directory of fraternities for first-year
students.

IFC President Gregory Rea said, “We
won this award because of the outstanding
organizational skills of our past IFC

in the conference.

“I’m really happy. We were able to keep
more girls in rush this year, and we raised
our quota by seven. For us, it just keeps
getting bigger and better,” White said.

Pitt’s representatives came away with
many ideas on how to improve the Greek
system here at the university.

“One of the most important aspects we
talked about was the idea of recruiting
minority groups. We should become more
culturally diversified.,This way we can
appeal to a wider audience of students,”
Rea said.

were suggested. “I feel we could diversify
the system by sponsoring cultural-diversity
workshops and by becoming more
involved in other campus organizations
and supporting their efforts,” Rea said.

Rea also suggested that Greeks focus
some rush ads towards minority groups
and commuters.

“These are two areas where we need to

expand our rush recruitment,” Rea said.

There were also discussions with other
Greek councils concerning scholarship
programs and programs to link them to
the university’s faculty.

Both the IFC and Panhel are working on

are faculty teas and a haunted house at

IFC is considering hosting an Easter egg

CWO criticizes college
as ‘privilege for elite’

By Kelli D. Herd
Sta_[f Writer

College is becoming a privilege for the rich and elite, Campus
Women’s Organization member Edith Wilson said at the
general meeting.

According to Wilson, the American educational system needs
to be changed. She said, “There is a lot of criticism, but no
money [is] going into education.”

Politically, Wilson said U.S. House of Representatives
Democratic candidate Marick Masters would be beneficial to
achieving this end. Masters, the director of Pitt’s M.B.A.
program, is challenging Republican Rep. Rick Santorum for the
18th district seat in the House.

Wilson cited that since Masters had headed the M.B.A.
program, its national ranking has increased to 17th in the
country. Wilson also said Masters was solidly pro-choice, and
she felt he was concerned with the economy and bringing jobs
back to this area.

CWO also discussed the “freshman packages” they are
planning to distribute to incoming students next fall.

According to Chairperson Holly Callender, the packages will
include general information as well as warning signs of an
abusive relationship. It will also include phone numbers and
addresses of women’s clinics in the area that give gynecological
exams and test for the HIV virus.

The April 5 March for Women’s Lives was also discussed.

' Buses for the march are scheduled to leave early Saturday

morning and will cost $25 a seat. Cross Currents, a women’s
group, will perform on March 27 to raise money for those who
can’t afford the trip.

Jaynes said Pitt has had‘ a
successful relationship with
WTAE in the past, both as a
broadcaster and as a rights-
holder.

“We are extremely happy to be
able to continue broadcasting Pitt
sports," WTAE Program Director
Tom Clendening said. “For
college sports in western
Pennsylvania, Pitt is definitely
the team to have.”

The agreementalso means that
WTAE will now produce and

Pitt Coaches Show featuring the
football and basketball coaches.

That show is now broadcast at 8 -

p.m. Thursday evenings during
the seasons. I

“We are confident WTAE will
continue its tradition of producing
top-quality broadcasts of our
games and coaches shows, and
we are hopeful the network can
continue to grow throughout the
region,” jaynes said.

of Pittsburgh,” WTAE Vice
Presidentjames Carter said. “We
look forward to more exciting

Goz/ern7nent’s tbe enemy in abortion debate

It is notdifficult to find serious threats to our
existence. Disease, poverty and homelessness
stare us cold every day. One problem that is
extremely deadly is abortion. This will not be
the same old rehashing of the abortion debate,
but it will be a stab at the problem.

The pro-choice side does not appeal to me.
The basic attitude of many, but not all, pro-
choicers is that acts of irresponsibility are
legitimate. They can do whatever they like
because in the end they have “the choice.”

The pro-life side makes me laugh, also. The
attitude here is that all babies must live. This
is fine if one is not concerned with the quality
of life.

I am disgusted at how these two cheer, sing,
chant and march like abortion is a college-
football rivalry! The issue at stake here is
human life, the baby's and the mother's.

A major attack on misinformation about sex
in general is needed. Putting every student
through some type of sex-education class at
an appropriate age should be as mandatory as
math or English requirements. This has proven
to be successful in preventing substance abuse,
and it could be just as successful in preventing
unwanted pregnancies and sexually trans-
mitted diseases. I

I have found one organization that is at-
tempting to educate in order to prevent. This

-is Planned Parenthood. Yes, it is pro-choice,

but its focus emphasizes pregnancy preven-
tion over abortion services. .
Francine Hurwitz is the director of commu-

  Tim
Desmond

nications for Planned Parenthood of Western
Pennsylvania. I recently spoke with Ms.
Hurwitz. Although our conversation was short,
she expressed genuine concern for the human
factor in the abortion equation.

She told me the aim of Planned Parenthood
is to “ provide care and control for all women,
regardless of race or income level.” It believes
that “education is the key to prevention and
that abortion should be safe and legal.” Once
again I will stress that the “safe and legal”
aspect of abortion is not what I’m concerned
with.

Not only does this organization promote
the education of the public, but it puts these
policies in motion. Ms. Hurwitz said Planned
Parenthood has “five administrators that work
seven days a week in local schools and other
community institutions attempting to inform
the students.”

Sounds wonderful. Now here is the catch:
The government provides about $200,000 a
year, which is about 18 percent of Planned
Parenthood’s budget. This, however, will be
eliminated in a couple of months, when
restrictions on Title , X funding are imple-
mented. Anyone who accepts Title X family-

planning money cannot discuss, refer or pro-
vide abortion services. ~

Hurwitz told me, “The government is very
hostile toward the education of sex and is not
committed [to pregnancy prevention." She
said she also believes the research and devel-
opment of birth control in the U.S. is inad-
equate, even inferior to the Europeans’. I have
only one question: Why?

» Regardless of what side you fall on in the
abortion debate, you have to agree that edu-
cation toward prevention is vital.

Eliminating abortion through education may
be an unrealistic or Utopian goal. But then
again, so were air travel and space explora-
tion.

Even the $200,000 received by Planned
Parenthood in the past is peanuts. If our
government committed a fraction of the re-
sources it used in the so—called “war on drugs”
to a “war on unwanted pregnancy," the abor-
tion battle would end.

The absence of an abortion debate would
lead to another problem. The sign-wavers
and cheerleaders would be out of their per-
manent occupations protesting abortion laws.
Maybe someone could organize a “Put ‘Night
Court’ Back on Thursday" group, which could
march on NBC studios. After all, some people
demonstrate professionally. They don't need
a reason.

You are probably aware that

President Bush, speaking for the

Somehow, in the face of our

nomic aid, the “economic” ratio-

for not helping people who are

Porn belittles women

I» am ‘writing in regard to the
editorial “Misunderstanding porn.”
If your idea of “sexual expres-
sion” is sitting around with a
bunch of your friends, a case of
beer and the latest edition of
Hustler or Debbie. Does Dallas
movie, then I feel sorry for you..

Despite what you may think,
studies have shown-that the type
of pornography that links sex to
violence increases men’s tolerance
of sexual aggression (Malamuth
and Donnerstein, 1983). A

Who is to say that this tolerance
does not have-.the..-potential to
become actual aggression?

If pornography functions as a

vent for “sexual expression,” then’

why have attacks on women risen
since the availability of this ma-
terial has spread (Bart, 1985)?

Students slighted

Correct me if I’m wrong. Isn't
your campus newspaper a place
for all of the different student
activities?

Apparently not. Pitt’s English
Club read at Hemmingway’s last
night as part of The
Hemmingway’s Reading Series.
This was the first time for the
undergraduate writers to be in-
cluded in this series.

We came to your office two
weeks ago asking for publicity
and a profile of some of Pitt’s
undergraduate poets. We received
no calls.

Last week another member of
the English Club had an interview
with one of your staff writers and
was blown off.

You did mention the reading in
yesterday's paper, but you failed
to give any names, place, time or
date of function.

Of course no one was there to
review it, either.

We aren’t going to beg you for
recognition. I've also realized why
this wasn't a big deal» to
you.

We aren’t Greeks.

We aren’t Pitt sports.

By the way, the room was
packed last night. Guess we didn't
need The Pitt News’ help after
all.

One of the most important
pieces of advice that I’ve ever
heard was given by Dr. Frances C.
Welsing during her lecture: Never
become angry with your opposi-
tion when addressing the issue of
racism because combative, intense
emotions have never helped to
solve the dilemma of racism, and
they never will. So this editorial is
not triggered by rage; the objec-
tive is rather to provide informa-
tion concerning the origins and
motives of racism.

First, it is useless to rely upon
white-controlled media to fairly
educate society on the theories of
black scholars, speciﬁcally black
scholars whose works have con-
tradicted those of noted white
scholars. It is very useful rather to
attend lectures and to read books,
so you can fairly formulate your
own opinions. Keep in mind that
you are relying upon the same

;media that labeled Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr. a Communist.
George Orwell said it best: Do not
allow Big Brother to manipulate
your mode of thinking. It is ab-
surd’ to place blind faith in the

media to provide information that-

you i‘ will never see televised or
hear in your classrooms because
it is viewed as a “threat” to_ the
masses.

Secondly, Welsing’s theories are
well respected and widely ac-

clair_,ned., Over 20 years ‘ago Dr.’
“Welsing developed’ the “Cress

Theory of Color Confrontation,"
which no psychiatrist/psycholo-
gist has even dared refute. Much
to his regret, Nobel Prize—winner,
nuclear physicist (and racist) Wil-
liam Shockley unsuccessfully de-
bated Welsing on national televi-

Attack racism,

sion. All who have attempted to
refute her have failed.

Moreover, Welsing never sug-
gests the idea of creating a supe-
rior race of people of color. Why
would a black woman who has
dedicated her work to eradicating
the evil of racism suggest retalia-
tory measures to people of color,
such as practicing upon whites
the same evils that whites have
historically practiced upon them?
(That would be called “fighting
fire with ﬁre,” a futile tactic in
which we all get burned.) Welsing
is rather concerned with uplifting
the collective conscious of black
people and combatting white
supremacy in the process.

She is not among the ranks of
racists, who propagate hate
rhetoric with no evidence or
theory to support their hate. In-

stead she specializes inscience ‘

and theory.

Welsing explains in her find-
ings thatnine-tenths of the people
in the world have color and ‘are

— therefore genetically dominant;

the remaining one-tenth of the

. world population does not pro-

ducecolor and is thus genetically

_ recessive Ca theory that’Welsing‘

did not invent). The term “geneti-

’ cally dominant" is not synony-
mous to racist terms like “supe-

rior;” racism cannot be confused
with the science of genetics. When
white rats are crossbred with black
rats and the offspring adopt the

not its Victims  

physical characteristics of the
parent rat that carries the domi-
nant gene, is that racism or the
science of genetic probability?

Welsing goes on to relate the
science of genetics to racism by
explaining that racism is triggered

by a deep—seated fear held by

those who are genetically reces-
sive — a fear of becoming geneti-
cally annihilated by people of
color. Hence, this is why she
views black male genitalia as the
“great genetic annihilator” -— not
simply the “great annihilator,” as
[The Pitt News’ Feb. 171 article
misquoted. Is it not self-explana-
tory as to why white supremacists
would view black—male genitalia,
which contain the genetic mate-
rial capable of “darkening” the
planet, as a threat to their goal of
white—race purity? The long his-
tory of the castration of black
males by white racists demon-
strates this idea.

Also, it is crucial to fully re-
search the history of racism as it
relates to both black people and
white people. The paradigm that
upholds European history is based
onthe assumption that people of
color are intellectually, culturally
and socially inferior to whites
(not a theory designed by

'-Welsing).

Beginning as. early as the
Christopher Columbus era and
traveling throughout “ European
history to the days of Mussolini’s_
fascism, many Europeans (in-
cluding the latter two) who helped
build the framework of European
history into what it currently is
expressed their hatred and fear of
dark-skinned people and prac-
ticed genocide on them.

For this very reason, Hitler can-
not be used to disprove Welsing.
In fact, Hitler best supports
Welsing’s theories. Would not a
crazed, racist leader who, due to
fear, led dark—skinned people to
their deaths and attempted to
develop a superior race of whites
inside of laboratories be a prime
example to support Welsing’s
theory of “fear of white genetic
annihilation?”

Thus it is incorrect to compare
Welsing to Hitler. By simply edu-
cating oppressed people on the
dynamics of racism, Welsing is
combatting the very evil that Hitler
gloriﬁed. The term “racist” is of-
ten used too leisurely; a racist in
our society is someone who has
the political, economic or social
power to implement his/her rac-
ism and thus subvert groups of
people. Therefore black people
who hold racist ideology are as
much a threat to white people as
a man who owns a gun but has no
bullets is a threat to public safety.

Perhaps many people react so
harshly to anti-racists such as
Welsing because they fear strong
opposition to a sick norm. Let us
not blame victims and allow vic-
timizers to go free; let us not
viciously attack slaves and not
slavery. Those ‘humans who are

truly ‘dedicated to the struggle for ’

civil, social and human rights
should unite against the evils of
racism and not against those who

have experienced racism for

hundreds of years and are, still
fighting against it.

“the practice of racial discrimination, persecu-
tion, etc.” So racism encompasses the actions

“to make distinctions in treatment; show«

partiality or prejudice” (discriminate) and “to
afﬂict constantly so as to injure or distress, as
for reasons of religion, race, etc.” (persecute).

Another key word is prejudice: “1. a pre-
conceived, usually unfavorable, idea; 2. an
opinion held in disregard of facts that contra-
dict it; bias; 3. intolerance or hatred of other
races, etc.; 4. injury or harm."

When a black man calls for the overthrow
of the white oppression of his people, every
two-bit journalist in the nation rallies to shut
him up. They make their own cries of racism,
prejudice and hate speech appealing to the
white majority while ignoring the facts. The
facts in this matter revolve around the article
written in Penn State’s The Daily Collegian
under the title “African Americans should not
trust ‘devilish’ white people.”

I've read the article several times. I still find
it amazing that all those denouncing it have
read the same thing! Other than the claim that
AIDS was created as a “diabolical plot to
exterminate black people,” I have no reason
to disbelieve anything that Chino Wilson,
controversial columnist, said.

But even that speculation is backed up.
Wilson quotes Haki Madhubuti’s “Black Men,
Obsolete, Single, Dangerous?," which reflects
the evidence of Dr. Theodore A. Strecker “that
the AIDS vims was created in a laboratory at
Fort Detrick, Md. from smallpox and Hepatitis
B vaccines.” And then he cites the infamous

Joe Babinsack

case of the Tuskegee Experiment, where 400
black soldiers were given syphilis and al-
lowed to return to society unknowingly.
Meanwhile the disease’s effects were studied

. over a period of years when the soldiers

presumably were spreading the disease among
their own people. Many have claimed that this
article is a call to kill innocent white people.
Where? Wilson calls for the arming of a black
militia, something very much constitutional,
and says, “The next time a white person
physically threatens us we should send that
person to the cemetery."

The only way I read the reaction is that
whites refuse to give up some God-given right
to “physical1ythreaten” those of another race.
And considering the amount of people who
bristle at the notion of blacks killing “inno-
cent" whites when the article Clearly states
that only those inﬂicting prejudice will be
dealt with, Wilson’s speculation that 85-90
percent of whites are “devout racists" seems
on target. V

Violence may not be the answer, but I'll tell
you what could be: the threat of violence.
Keep up the clamoring. Keep up the struggle.
The white man has the power, and who
would give up a single thread of control if he
or she didn't have to? Threaten. Scare. Lay
bare the fear, both righteous and physical,
that is under the skin of every racist white in
America. ’

claimed that he would fight a guerilla war
against that city if economic and housing
problems were not attempted to be solved in
five years. The response was similar.

Instead of saying, “Gee, we should try to
help, then no one will be forced into vio-
lence,” everyone, both media and watchers
alike, said, “How can we defend ourselves?,”
and, “How do you justify hurting innocents?"
It seems as though everyone is so ready to
accept the fact that nothing should be done to
solve the problems -causing this reaction.

Only the whites of this nation can solve the
problem through non-violence and peaceful
means. And if we all continue to refuse, don’t
blame the black man for securing his rights
and peace through violence. Whites decreed
that all men are created equal, and Henry
shouted, “Give me liberty or give me death!,’'
when we fought the British for rights. Yet now
we hold back a huge amount of that freedom,
whining and complaining when someone
else requests it.

Amazing how many cry to the black activists,

“But you love Martin Luther King, Jr.; he -

espoused “peace, and you violence!,” and
generally try to shame them into submission.

Is peace working for the black man? No, it's
the status quo._ Peace_only follows a war; it

never precedes it. Peace will not bring about '

Seniors shi

By Brian Gallagher

Now tbat’s the way to say
goodbye to the seniors.

Pitt got a career night from
forward Chris McNeal and brilliant
farewell bows from Sean Miller
and Darren Morningstar while
keeping its NCAA Tournament
hopes alive with a 90-66 thrashing
of Boston College at Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

The win bumps the Panthers’
record to 9-8 in Big East

their own. Miller equalled his
career-best in assists with 13 and
scored 14 points to boot.
Morningstar put on his hard hat
and worked inside all night,
tallying 18 points and nabbing
nine boards. For Miller, the win
was a sweet way to cap off his
five years at Pitt.

“I've watched a few of my

friends leave here on a sour note,
and I wanted to go out on a win,"
Miller said, adding the importance
of the game took priority.
“Especially with being a bubble
team, this was like a tournament

game. That's how we attacked it,
and hopefully it will be a jump
start for the team towards the
NCAAs.”

A key sparkplug for the rest of
the way will be McNeal, who had

garnered career highs in both
points (27) and rebounds (20), as
Pitt used its size advantage to
control the paint area all night.

Pitt hosts EWL championships this weekend  

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer

The Eastern Wrestling League has
symbolized excellence with a streak of
eight consecutive years of producing an
NCAA champion. This league turned out
13 All-Americans last season, the second-
highest number in league history. (Fifteen
in 1987 was the highest.) Nine of those are
still around, looking to grab another berth
in the NCAA Championships.

They and many more of the nation’s
finest wrestlers will battle at Fitzgerald

the 17th Annual liastern Wrestling League
Championship Tournament.

powerhouses Clarion and West Virginia,
along with contenders Bloomsburg and
Lock Haven, in an effort to knock the king
from his throne. The Penn State Nittany
Lions have won the team title the last 10
years, and 13 out of 16 titles overall belong
to PSU. Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said he expects ﬁerce jockeying between
these teams, but he sees a tough task for
seven of the eight schools.

“I think this is gonna be the most wide-
open race —— except for Penn State,”
Stottlemyer said. “Penn State’s got all the
horses. On paper, they’re obviously the
favorite. But the race for the No. 2 spot is
wide-open. Penn State just has too many
horses that are locks.

State’s Tim Wittman, a two-time EWL
champion at 150, and West Virginia’s
Doug Taylor.

“Tim Wittman is going to be the toughest
competition there,” Hovan said. “He’s
already proven that he’s capable of beating
some of the toughest guys.”

Hovan and Wittman locked up earlier
this season at Penn State, with Hovan
picking up an 8-2 decision. He won the
EWL crown with a 14-5 major decision
over West Virginia’s Dave Onorato last
year and will again be the top seed. After
weeks of anticipation, Hovan said he is
just concentrating on the little things now.

“I’m just trying to put everything together,

Angle is a three-time EWL champion.
He did not wrestle when Pitt and Clarion
met because of a knee injury, but he and
Miller appear destined to knock heads.
Miller said he is feeling the pressure of
tournament time, knowing that opponents
will be looking for that big upset.

“They all should be tough matches,”
Miller said. “Plus everybody’s gonna be
really gunning at EWLS, more so than dual
meets.”

Miller was virtually unknown on the
national scene until last year, and his
dominance has taken many by surprise.

Pitt lacrosse pummels Slippery Rode, 1 635

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Sta_[f Writer

After another slow start, the Pitt
lacrosse team continued its high-
scoring ways Tuesday night,
defeating the Rockets from
Slippery Rock University 16-5 at
Pitt Stadium.

The victory for Pitt leaves it
with a 2-0 record. Both wins
came against Allegheny Lacrosse
League opponents.

Pitt started the game, as itdid in
its first, sloppily. The offense was
not able to sustain mu ch pressure,
throwing away passes and forcing
bad shots. Pitt was not really able
to test Slippery Rock’s goalie for
much of the first period. The
Panther defense began the game
strong, keeping the Rockets’
attack well away from the Pitt
goal.

“I guess we are going to be
notoriously slow starters this
year,” Pitt head coach Gary Neft
said. -
Having seen enough of the

l sloppy offense, Neft called a time

out to settle‘ down his team. It
seemed to have worked because
when play resumed, the Panthers
began to play sharper, making
passes that before were errant

and testing Slippery Rock’s

goaltender with good, quick
shots.

The pressure paid off for Pitt at
the 8:17 mark, when attackman
Josh Gochnauer took a pass from
Brian Barrett and put home Pitt’s
first goal of the game. Slippery
Rock almost tied the game two
minutes later, when goalie Shiner
was caught out of his net. But the
shot went wide of the empty
Panther goal, giving Pitt
possession.

Attackman Craig Leslie took
the ensuing pass from Shiner,
raced the length of the ﬁeld and
scored Pitt’s second goal at 1 1:08.
But again Slippery Rock roared
back. On their next possession,
the Rockets hit the Panther goal,
halving Pitt’s lead, 2-1 . That would
be as close as the Rockets would
get all evening.

Pitt wasted no time at the start

of the second quarter, getting a
goal by midﬁelder Dave Kounas
just 14 seconds into the period
and adding two more goals by
Gochnauer and Chad Lehman
just three minutes later to open
up a S~1 lead.

The offense was not ﬁnished,
however. Pitt also got goals from

‘ Lee Stember, Kounas, Eric Kaveny

and Ed Croot to blow open a
previously close game and take a
9-2 lead into the half. Goalie Mike
Shiner was replaced by Scott
Knowles, but he managed seven
saves on only nine Slippery Rock
shots.

Slippery Rock did manage to
stage a mini—comeback later in
the period, putting two goals past
goaltender Knowles, but the
Panthers roared back to quell any
uprising with goals by Stember
and Kounas to take an

insurmountable 14-4 lead into
the game’s ﬁnal period.

With only 15 minutes left to
play and their second win well in
hand, the Panthers relaxed on
offense and fell into a ball-control
style of play, not allowing Slippery
Rock a chance at possession.‘The
Rockets did, however, break
through the tough Panther
defense for their ﬁfth goal. Pitt
came back with goals by
midfielder Chris Rice and Croot
to round out the game’s scoring.

Leading the Panthers in scoring
were Stember and Croot, who
tallied three goals and one assist
each, and Kaveny, who scored
one goal along with three assists.

“We knew we were playing a
weaker opponent, and we just
wanted to beat them into the
ground,” said Pittdefenseman
Pat Condo.

Continued from page 8
“He’s been doing a very nice

- job. He doesn’t have the exposure

that most of the heavyweights in
the EWL have,” Lorenzo said.

Pitt's hopes run much deeper
than just Miller and Hovan. Sean
Gibbs (167) has proven that he is
ready to move into the nation's
elite. Gibbs is 23-5 and should be
the No. 2 seed behind PSU's
Dave Hart. Gibbs lost 9-1 to Hart
at Penn State but said he doesn’t
believe that was a true indication
of his capabilities.

“I just want to get into the finals
and get a chance at Hart,” he said.
“I definitely think that I can beat
him. T here's no doubt in my
mind.”

This is another very strong
division with Bob Benson of
Cleveland State, Ron Coffel of
Lock Haven and Dave Onorato
of West Virginia. But the strongest
division could be 118, with three

wrestlers ranked among the top
15 in the nation.

Bobby Simpson has wrestled
at 126 for most of the dual-meet
season but will drop down to the
118-pound class. The junior is
poised to make a run at Penn
State’sJeff Prescott, the defending
national champion. This is a
brutally tough class that also
includes Erik Burnett of Clarion,
Tim Casey of Bloomsburg and
Mike Elsass of Cleveland State.

Simpson said he realizes his
competition is tremendous. “I
think I'm gonna have to wrestle
my best. I think just about
anybody at 118 can place and
move on,” Simpson said.

Many coaches around the
league said they think sophomore

Jeff Kloiber (190) will be a major
factor, not only this weekend,
but for the next two years. Another
contender at this class is Jason
Loukides of Edinboro, whom

Kloiber tied 1-1. Kloiber (12-6-3) ‘

said be experts Budd and Penn
State sophomore Adam Mariano
to be his toughest rivals for the
190-pound crown.

“I’m not going to the
tournament just to ‘place and go
to nationals. I’m going to win it,”
Kloiber said.

Although he has been injured
for much of the season, junior
Steve Budman (142) cannot be
counted out. Despite the injuries,
Budman is 18-6-2 and will
challenge in another class stacked
with talent. John Dasta of Clarion,
Shannyn Gillespie of Lock Haven,
Tom Shifﬂet of Edinboro and
Steve Lilley of Bloomsburg are all
capable of advancing to nationals.

Lorenzo’s Nittany Lions enter
the tourney as a heavy favorite.
The Nittany Lions (18-4-1, 7-0 in
EWL) have been a Top 5 power
for most of the season, currently
checking in at No. 4 in the latest

NWCA poll. Their lineup is
stacked with talent from top to
bottom, featuring eight wrestlers
ranked among the Top 10
nationally in their respective
weight classes. But Lorenzo said
he isn’t underestimating the
competition.

“I don’t ever go into a
tournament taking anything for
granted, and I hope my guys
don’t either,” Lorenzo said. “Our
goal is to get 10 guys to the
national tournament and as many
EWL champions as we can.

“It’s gonna take a total team,

effort to win the EWLS. You have
to have an intense and complete
effort in this league.”

Penn State could have as many
as four or five wrestlers seeded
first in their weight classes. It all
starts with Prescott, who is ranked
second in the nation at 126 with
a record of 22-1. He will drop
back to 118 for the tournament. ‘

Prescott, along with sophomore
Shawn Nelson (126) and Bob
Truby (134), give Penn State a
dynamite trio at the top of its
lineup.

“I think we’ve been getting a
very consistent performance out
of our first three guys,” Lorenzo
said. “Jeff Prescott has been having
a very consistent season. He’s
very hungry to be a national
champ again, and he’ll be ﬁring
on all cylinders. They have been
a pretty good 1-2-3 punch for us.
They’ve really set the tempo."

Nelson (21—2-2) is ranked
seventh in the nation at 118, but
he and Prescott are flip-flopping
weight classes for E\X/Ls. Truby is
ranked fourth in the nation with
a mark of 20-5-2. Troy Sunderland
(150) is 18-2-2, ranked No. 4 in
the nation and should be the top
seed in his weight class.- ‘

Lock Haven's standouts are
sophomore Gillespie (142) and
junior Dale Budd (190).Gillespie
is 26-7, including a big, 8-5 victory
over the returning EWL champ,

; Dasta, of Clarion, in a recent dual

meet. Budd is 24-4-1 and won the
PSAC Championship at Clarion.
Bloomsburg’s best hopes lie
with 118-pounder Casey,
sophomore Andy Fitzpatrick (150)
and senior Matt Kreider (177).
Head coach Roger Sanders said
he expects five or six of his
wrestlers to place among the top
four in their respective classes.
Casey (21-S-1) is ranked 11th in
the nation at 126 but will move
down, while Pete Rinella will
wrestle at 126 for the Huskies.

Fitzpatrick, 25-5, is ranked 19th. -

If the seedings hold up, this
tourney should showcase some
titanic matchups. The EWL will
send 40 wrestlers to Oklahoma
City and should bring home a
couple more national champions.

“I don’t look at anybody as a
shoe-in to win in this tournament,”

Lorenzo said. “They’re gonna '

have to earn it. From the
quarterfinals right on, you’re
going to see some of the finest
wrestling to come out of
Pennsylvania in a long time. It
just doesn’t get too much finer
than this.”.

Continued from page 2
being symbols of demo-
cratization,” Baykan said.

She cited historical records she
has unearthed in the United States
which document the social and
philanthropic impact women
have had in Turkey since the late
1800s. In modern Turkey, roughly
40 percent of the professional _
occupations are held by women.

Baykan found records in the
United States indicating that the
Turkish Women’s Party was
founded in 1925 with an initial
membership of 500. The party
existed for several years until it
voluntarily dissolved because it
was not enfranchised. The key
members of the party then
established a league in 1928.
Philanthropic and social issues
were discussed by the league.
Women in Turkey were
enfranchised in 1930.

The league disbanded in 1935
because Turkey elected 18
women (5 percent) to its
Parliament to protest to the fascist
political systems of Italy and
Germany prior to WWII,
according to Baykan.

DiPao1o  

Continued from page 1
to New York University and
Carnegie Mellon, DiPao1o decided
that she would go to CMIand stay
with her mother. . 4

At CM, DiPaolo wrote most of
Bricklayers while working on her
master’s in fine arts degree in
play writing. In 1990, after many
rewrites, her play won an
invitation to the National
Playwrights Conference at the
O’Neil Theater in Connecticut.
From there, it was chosen by the
Yale Repertory Theater -for its
1991 winter season. This past
November the play debuted in
Pittsburgh.

About her plans for the future,
DiPao1o said that she is working
on another play‘ as well as. a
miniseries pilot. While not
revealing anything about the

miniseries, she said that the play/ .

she is working on has to do with
her faith. The playhas yet to be
given a title, but if she had to
name it today DiPaolo said she
would call it “S.O.S., like in the
distress signal.”
