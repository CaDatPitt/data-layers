ut has never stayed out of touch

.

Recently he was in New York for a Chemical Convention, but
kept in touch with his staff on every development in his laboratory.

_“The calls between New York and

Pittsburgh were almost like local

calls they were made so often,” he said. -

Credits Associate
Levine credits Dr. Samuel Damishefsky, associate professor in
organic chemistry with much of the work ‘done. Damishefsky, who
haslstudied at the Yeshiva University and Harvard, has worked
closely ‘with Levine on many of his projects. “He is a great mind,”

Levine said.

Levine then went on to explain the mechanism for the drugs,
among which are 2-propionyl thipphene, and perﬂuoro propionyl-

2-phenolymethane, work by a

chelating mechanism, whereby

parts of the molecule act like jaws, and facilitate the transport
of a metal ion to its place of action. This process makes a sub-
stance available for chemical reaction which would not ordinarily

be available for action.

District Attorney Roht. Duggan

Discusses Crime In County

By BILL ROSEWATER

. Robert W. Duggan, district attorney of Allegheny
County, discussed the methods he is using to attempt to
break up organized crime in the county during his talk last
Wednesday evening in the lobby of Tower A. The talk was
sponsored by the Men’s Dorm ‘Council.

Duggan also discussed new policies and procedures he

has instituted since he took olﬁceé

three months ago and the results
his program‘ has produced so -far.

According to Duggan, the Dis-
trict Attorney’s ofﬁce under ex-
District Attorney Boyle “arrested
only two suspects accused of being
active in the rackets during the
entire year of 1963. In the first
three months of this year, 145 ar-
rests have been made in this area.”

However, the District Attor-
ney is certain that these arrests
will do no good unless their is
a co-ordinated effort between
the courts and the District At-
torney’s office to stamp out or--
ganized crime. He does not feel
that he has got this co-operation
now.'. i‘ —

I-Ie“mentioned a case of one man
who has been arrested eight times
for peddling narcotics. Each time
this man "received the minimum
sentence of a $250 ﬁne. The Dis-
trict Attorney feels that this "situ-
ation is disgraceful and wants
the law changed so that.any_ man

0 convicted for the second time of

selling ‘narcotics faces a .manda-
tory life sentence. He hopes that
this measure may help rid Pitts-
burgh of organized crime. '

- Feeling that the District Attor-

ney’s oﬁice under his predecessor ‘

had been extremely inefficient’,
Duggamﬁred about 85 per cent of
the personnel in this oﬁice and
hired people of his own choice. He
now has 24 Assistant District At-
torney’s working under him. So
far this year about 1800 new cases

have been brought before his

office. This was substantially more

than the number of cases brought '

before the District Attorney’s ofﬁce
for the same period last year com-
mented Duggan. “This ofﬁce has

managed‘ to clean up the biggest-

backlog of _cases in the_ history of
Allegheny County so that cases

brought in during the middle of _

March ‘are being tried this week,”
he concluded. ‘

After the meeting Duggan held
a‘ short question and answer ses-
sion. '

  Hitarial: Frustrating Stalemate  

     

 -. . . .

llVl.Ibnclia»$','Ai1ii-nil 5, 1564 T L

 

Controversy over division of labor between Locals 1987 and 5 has

3 stalemated construction of the new language labs. The three-week delay
‘ has kept over 900 University students, not to mention those from the four
regional campuses, from using the facilities at the most crucial part of

the term. ,

This frustrating and needless inconvenience has been caused mainly
by the two unions inability to see any further than their own deﬁned list
of duties. Each one is screaming that they are the ones to do the job, and
in the meantime neither is doing it and the labs lay incomplete.
if Construction of a different "sort was enthusiastically planned at a

Student Affairs meeting two weeks ago. Under the substitute chairman-

ship of Dean Helen Rush, in the absence .of Vice Chancellor of Student
and General Affairs Alan C. Rankin, the group of administrative, faculty,
and student leaders outlined vital plans for student involvement in the

' University. ‘

 

This would include students being explained rationale behind ad-

: ministrative decisions, such as the recent restriction to 17-credit loads of
. all students with under a 2.75 QPA.

More importantly, this would also includeconsulting students and
including them in initial stages of policy planning where it affects them

and where feasible, such as regarding allocations for student organizations.

The student leaders went -into the next Student Affairs meeting
expecting action. Encouraged by the cooperation of Dean Rush and other
committee members, 15 student presidents had met on their own and
were excited at the prospect of increased student—administrative co—opera-
tion. A _ , .

Dr. Rankin had returned from his vacation, and unfortunately,
could not immediately accept the principles adopted at the previous meet-
ing. If anything, he was not quite prepared for the students challenging
and previous scope of the Student Affairs Committee or of their prospect
for participation in decisions. . ‘

He said he had assumed that students were already involved, but

‘when speciﬁc instances were mentioned he appeased inquiry by saying

that these decisions had been quite satisfactory without any element of
student involvement. - '

Thus another action is at a stalemate because it is easier to be safe . ' -

and follow past deﬁnition of.-duties. When ‘progress of the University
plant and of student interest is stalemated because of an unnecessary.
conservatism, the stimulus becomes frustrated —— and there is no time
for this in the growth of a school. « . » _ l‘

 "For A Real SG . . .,

Within the last few
months there has ‘been
quite a bit of- controversy

, ‘ centering around Student
’ Government.

Unfortunate-
ly, most of the discussion

’ - ‘i, has been beside the point.

,..a—..

  

This article is written on S

the assumption that the
function of SG is to govern
student affairs. If this is not
the case, then let’s_ give SG
another name.

Allrealgovernments
have the power of the
purse. That is, they make
budgets, thereby allocating
the resources of the com-
munity. If SG is to have
any meaning, these people
who are selected as student
representatives should de-

‘. cide, in the words of Harold

' Lasswell, “Who gets what,

where, and how.”

In other words, who-
ever decides where student
groups and organizations
get money and how much

,they get, governs student

affairs. Everything else is

‘ window dressing.

All student organiza-
tions which now receive
funds directly from vari-
ous administration
sources, should get those
funds from SG. Funds in
this case would include
subsidies in the form of

- permitting use of Univer-
. sity facilities for meet-
ings or social affairs.
. Student affairs, in other
words, should be run by
the students through
their representatives. '
When all student organi-
zations and groups were
brought under the control

‘ of SG the administration

  

01:! f Auwu'ca'.f

The Power of the Purse H 

could give SG a budget ap-
proximately adequate to

cover’ the current expense _

of- all the various groups.
From then on, however,

SG would beﬁresponsible .

for providing more funds
or more office space if one
organization, such as -The
Pitt News, discovered costs
were going up or they
wanted to expand.

SG would also be re-
sponsible for sutting the
allocations to any speciﬁc
organization. SG would
thus be fairly responsible’
to _the student body, be-
cause if they stepped too
far out of line, they
would have a ﬁght on,
their hands with the
group which they offend-
ed. Likewise, SG would
be responsible to the ad-
ministration because they
would be forced to justify
their own budget.

And most important, SG
would be preforming a
function that should be
their’s.“ They would be run-
ning student affairs.

In addition" to allowing
SG to perform its proper
function of governing, the
plan has the added virtue
of promising to cure an-
other ill in our University
community. If SG is given
the power of the purse, in-
terest in SG will probably
sky-rocket. This is so be-
cause SG will probably
make mistakes, will prob-

, ably step on someone’s toes.

When SG errs because of
pettyness or stupidity, stu-
dents will howl. And the

students will soon ﬁnd -out- - i

that in order to get what

they want from SG they

Grad Student Affacks Lovers

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘At last someone had the courage to
write and attempt to justify necking or
kissing, etc. in public. It should be they
had the “half courage” because they pre-
ferred t0 remain anonymous. And I would
too, for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that the

' letter is full of_ assumptions, statements

which show an uninformed person, and
backs something which is in very poor
taste. I refer to the letter appearing in the
March 25 issue of The Pitt News entitled
“Senior Loves Lovers.” ~

Let’s look at this letter in parts. Right
in the ﬁrst paragraph the writer approach-
es the subject sarcastically. In the second
-paragraph heassumes that many of the
letters written in protest of the subject

were “crank.” "How does he know? He has
no basis for thisstatement. He has the
people who might write such letters in.
catagories which are rather poo’r guesses,
in keeping with the tone of the whole
letter. The second" paragraphends with a
monumental, philosophical, undiplomatic
knock at the probable attitudes or mental
conditions of such persons.

But the third paragraph is where your

correspondent really went astray. True,

how- he or she feels towards the one they

love’ and how they express such feelings _

is. theirihusi es. 319ne,- but)w.h.en;..:do

   

comings which seems to be 3
involved in this plan could
be ironed out.

This plan is not proposed
as a cure-all. But'it is ad-

or the students?”

' public, it is everyone else’s business. And

no one is a_nebnose when a couple insists
on overt displays of affection in public.
The couple deserve all the stares and nasty
comments anyone can muster when they
display their affections ——.kissing, hug-
ging, etc. — in public. .

Let’s face it, Liberal Arts Senior, if
Love is the most important part of a per-
sons total education, then you and I are

Any couple who have respect and honor

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

Next Monday night’s' Academy Awards promises to be‘
one of those wild nights, the type of which belongs to the
American public only oncelia. year. This is the evening when
the stars come out in every way, shape, and form to pay hom-
age to themselves. On. this particular occasion, Jack Lemmon
has been chosen to handlethe reins and there is every indica-

tion that the gifted Mr. ‘Lemmon will not gosour on this occasion._

It’s a known fact that Bob Hope owns the job of MC ‘for the\Oscars,
but Mr. Lemmon’s charm should carry the evening and “follow
stylishly in “Ski Nose’s” tradition. In what follows I hopeto put the
Academy voters on a couch and come up with some ‘sort of analysis.
In other words, I’ll make like Beano Cook'and go “out on a limb.”

We can start with the best foreign ﬁlm, since this seems like one
of the sure things of the evening. Fellini’s .“8‘/2” has garnered ﬁve
important nominations and came close to receiving the best picture
of the year nomination. The only other ﬁlm to be considered would
be the Polish “Knife in the Water” which was a ﬁne motion picture.
The other three ﬁlms haven’t been shown in most of the cities around
the United States. “81/2"’ is themost successful foreign ﬁlm to be
imported and before the serious moviegoer questions my taste, it is
also the best received ﬁlm by all the critics. A deﬁnite win.

In the supporting actor category there is not too much from
which to choose, I chose Melvyn Douglas, “Hud’s” father, as
best_ of the year: Whom the- Academy chooses is another story
and because of ‘the band wagon, Hugh Griffith will win. “Tom
Jones” is too powerful an entry to shun and.Mr. Griﬂith’s Squire
Western will get. the majority vote. ’ The best supporting actress
should, and probably’ will, be Margaret Rutherford, the grand ’
old lady of Great Britain, the Queen Mother excluded. After
thirty-five years and_ so- many wonderful performances which
have gone unheralded by the Academy, Miss Rutherford will
ﬁnally get her due. * S

_ ‘Five actresses "have been nominated for the top accolade. If
Hollywood tradition holds true, Leslie Caron will probably take the

A Oscar back to Great Britain. This will be a shame. Patricia Neal

should have been in the supporting category and then wouldn’t have
had any trouble in winning the Oscar. However, the voters thought
highly of her to place Miss Neal in the best actress category. She

deserves the award’ and to hell with Hollywood sentiment!

The best actor award should provide the voterslwithu many
nightmares prior to the ﬁnalballoting. Albert" Finney, Paul Newman,
Rex‘ Harrison,.'Sidney‘ Poitier and Richard Harris were equally bril-
liant. If you ‘have followed my column then it should be clear whom
I want as this year’s winner. “Paul Newman got ﬁnagled out of a much
deserved award two years» ago when he was “The Hustler.” Now he
is “Hud,” and his performa‘n’ce~was ‘a truly great one. Albert Finney
was wonderful‘ and I won’t be surprised" if he wins. But I will be
disappointed if Newman doesn’t.'

And then. "there was “Tom Jones.” By far the ﬁnest film of
the year. Certainly the best‘ produced from all angles as Tony
Ri'chardson’s best direction award will show. Therefore I won’t
fight the rush and will jump on the “Tom Jones” bandwagon.
This is another sure thing. '

Other names to look for in the winner’s spotlight are James
Wong Howe, who did the photography for “Hud,” and. the Italian
contingent who wrote the top song, “More.” I would like to see “Call
Me Irresponsible” take the prize and even three in a row -for Mr.

Mancini would make me happy. But Hollywood loves to show’ how »

nice-they can-be to our friends overseas and this good neighbor policy
will give the award'”to “More.”

‘‘ Those are my picks and the probable winners ‘by Hollywood’sl
choice.‘ As always, the ‘evening will begin on a notevof nerves and
laughs. After Jack Lemmon has wished America “Good Luck” and
“Happy Moviegoing” the mood will be one of laughs and kisses. There
will also be tears, tears and tears. It happens every year and will
continue so long as Narcissus keeps his hold on the wonderland known
as “Hollywood.” ‘But America loves it and eats up every moment. In
our wonderful country there are reasons for holidays and April 13th
is the day for the'stars to glow.

Eliminates M ulti -Interpretations

IF C Announcesﬂushing Rules

By TONY CHARIOTT. _

I Permanent rules for rushing were set up in the Interfraternity Council meeting last

Tuesday.

5

Jack Koury of Delta Tau Delta, rush committee chairman and IFC vice president,
read the new rules, explaining why permanent rules were necessary and clarifying the

meanings of each rule.

In the past, rules were haistily drawn up during ﬁrst week of fall trimester and often

resulted in misinterpretations, said¢
._ Koury. Many rules were retained
.;from previous rushes, but made

more explicit to eliminate multi-
interpretations‘. Copies of rules
will be sent to parents of new
students during summer.

Changes Made
Some important changes are in-
cluded in new rules. At the ini-
tial smoker only five fraternity
men from each house may attend,
and no other men may substitute
for them. The Student Uni_on
area is deﬁned in detail, and only
those ﬁve men from each frater-
nity are allowed within these
bounds. V
No waiting cars may be

parked within bounds. In the
past, members have hurriedly
ushered rushees into waiting
cars and taken them to parties.
In future this type of rush will
be eliminated. If rushees are
interested’ in a party they must
-wait somewhere off Student
Union bounds to be picked up.
The ﬁve house members cannot
escourt rushees away from the
smoker. If a rushee wants to
return to his room with bro-
chures, he will meet no counter
pressure.

‘Another troublesome spot re-
garding the smoker was also made
clear. The smoker is over for a
rushee the moment he leaves.
There is no speciﬁc time. As
rushees leave the smoker inter-
mittently, time limits to regulate
beginning of rushing becomes im-
possible. '

Party Restrictions

Only ‘stag parties will be al-
lowed on the evening of the
smoker, ending the use of girls to
entice rushees to parties. Cards
will ‘be issued to rushees upon
registration and must be pre-
sented to fraternities when going
This rule. is] an
effort to forstall non-rushees
crashing parties, added Koury.

No alcoholic beverages, in-

eluding "beer", ' will be“ permitted i

from the beginningof Fall tri-

mester till the end of rush. If

'3 fraternity man meets a rushee

in a. bar, neither are permitted

to have alcohol unless they are

not sitting together, nor may a

fraternity man buy a drink. '

§5~.5ggs.e.:g:~:-.'

No time limit curfews rushing
at night, save in men’s dorms.
There, rushees may not be rushed
above the main lobby after 11
a.m. Otherwise, if a rushee wants
to meet fraternity men at late
hours, it is his decision.

New Rush Committee

Jack Koury announced seven
members of his Rush Committee,
noting that not more than‘ one
man from any house was on com-

mittee. Koury can only vote on_

an isue in case of a tie.

The members are Bob Knight
of Delta Tau Delta, Eliot Brum-
berger of Pi Lambda Phi, Jim
Meyerson of Sigma Alpha A Mu,
Jim Jaffe of Zeta Beta Tau,
Frank Goldberger of Phi Epsi-
lon Pi, and Richard Bruni of
Kappa Theta. ,

The Rush Committee plans a
poster contest to advertise the
opening smoker next Fall. A pos-
ter must include time and date,
but’ cannot show the name of an
individual fraternity. The com-
mittee is making up a rush slo-
gan, which must also be included
on the poster.

A Hootenanny is also planned
for the weekend of the first foot-
ball game.

Other Areas Discussed

This summer the sports_ pro-
gram and point system for inter-

. fraternity sports will be discussed.

IFC also passed a bill for the
interfraternity‘ Loan and Schol-
arship Fund, though details are
still not deﬁnite. Interest rates
and exceptions were discussed,
and ‘IFC felt that some loans
might be pro-rated.

One new idea was for an “emer-
gency” provision. If an accident
occurs in a boys’ family, the fund
could loan up to $100 to pay for
plane expenses aiding a boy to get
home.

Some new chairmanships were
announced ‘by Norm‘ Himes, pres-
ident of IFC. George Prussin of
P-hi Epsilon, Pi is Athletic Chair-
man, Jim Moyer of Pi Lambda
Phi is Social, Harry Kolbert of
Sigma’Chi is Pledge Trainer, Ray

Burkett of Phi Gamma Delta is.

Scholarship, and Bruce Martin of
Pi Lambda Phi is Publicity Chair-
man. Bernard Mannheimer of
Zeta Beta Tau is assistant Ath-
letic Chairman.
'l‘uesday’s meeting was the
.last regularly scheduled meeting
until the fall.

include ﬁve literature courses cov-
ering medieval to present. They
may be taken in any order. A
sixth ﬁeld course, entitled “Semi-
nar on Civilization,” must be taken
on completion of the other ﬁve
courses. It will synthesize the
knowledge of literature which
students have acquired in the pre-
ceding courses.

The course will require a “writ-
ten project which will allow each
student to pursue a particular sub-
ject in dep_th,” according to Car-
/dona. The examination at the end
of the seminar will be in the na-
ture of a Bachelor's comprehen-
sive.

.- I May Choose
At this point, the student who

, exempted the 55 and 56 courses by

exceptionally high performance in
the 30, 31 series needs six more

:credits to fulfill the requirement

of 30. He may choose from the

-. three remaining ﬁeld courses, Ad-
‘ .vanced Problems in Grammar, 130;

.Phonetics, '13l; - Civilization, 150,
151, or he may participate inthe
honors program by taking courses
on the graduate level.

The Romance Language De-
‘partment recommends an alter-
nate program for students in the
School of Education. They are
L to take the same core courses as
liberal arts students, but are ad-
vised to substitute 130, 131,‘ 150
and 151 for ﬁeld courses. Car-
dona considers 130 and 131 “of

a practical nature because the; ‘

student will .learn how to teach
grammar and pronunciation, a
skill which they can apply im-
mediately in their secondary
school teaching.” Like Italian
‘majors, education students ma-
joring in French or Spanish may
count the intermediate level (3
and 4) of their language toward
their.30 required credits.

“Students who have already de- .

clared their majors under the old

gram,” explained Cardona. “This
will be true also of those students
whose program has been mapped
out already and for whom the
completion of 30 credits in their
major would entail having to go
to school one extra trimester.”

Therefore present freshmen and
incoming freshmen will come un-
der the new plan of study.

Combination Major

The Spanish department «is now‘

offering a major in Spanish Amer-
ican literature on the undergrad-
uate level as well as Spanish lit
and a combination of the two.

This year the Spanish Amer-
ican literature program ’was
offered only on the graduate
level. The addition of Dr.. Al-
fredo Roggiano, managing edi-
tor of the Revista Iberoamer-
icana, described by Cardona as
possibly the most distinguished
publication concerning Latin
American literature,” has made
the program possible.

The Revista Iberoamericana is

the organ of the International In—_
stitute of Latin American Litera-
ture. “Since the University spon-
sors the Revista and'Roggiano and
the secretary-treasurer of the In-
stitute, Saul Sibirsky, presently di-
rector of the language ‘laboratory
here, are on the University’s fac-

-ulty, for all practical purposes the

Institute is represented by Pitt in
the United States,” Cardona ex-'
plained.

The new program, which Sibir-
sky calls “one of the most com-
plete ones in the country,” is in
line with the special interest the"
University has in Latin America
where the University has two afﬁ1-
iate institutions. ‘

Frosh Players Key  
To Strong Baelcfield’
For Football Team

By BILL CABIN

The performance of the freshman backs will deter-
mine the strength of the 1964 Panther backfield. That’s
how backﬁeld coach Bimbo Cecconi summed up the back-
ﬁeld situation. “We have few experienced players at
each spot and the young kids are going to fill in the gaps.
We’ll be in good shape if they come through. ‘

“Nothing will be deﬁnite till the end of the spring or in the
fall, because anythingfcould happen,” Cecconi said. As of now,
however, the starting backﬁeld has Kenny Lucas at quarterback,
Dale Stewart at left halfback, Eric Crabtree at right halfback

and Barry McKnight at fullback. Lucas
and Crabtree played. with the second
team last year, while Stewart and Mc-
WKnight were third-stringers.

But Cecconi emphasized that the
current ﬁrst team meant little. ‘‘All
positions are open except one,” he said.
“Quarterback? is the only set position.

, Fred Mazurek has" already earned his
spot. As far as Pm concerned his record
‘speaks for itself. He’ll go to fall camp

. as the number one quarterback.”

This puts Lucas, who has assum-
ed Mazurek’s spot while Mazurek is

 

CECCONI .
playing basketball, in an unenviable spot. He has no chance to
move up. from his second team berth of last year, but could move
down since he-is-receiving stiff competition from a trio of fresh-

lmen — Pete Smith, Ed James, and Jim rem.‘ b

Cecconi is currently letting Smith, James and Pohl run with
the second unit a couple of days each. He said, “It’s, the only fair

. way to see who can- handle the team best.”“

Crabtree has been playing with the ﬁrst team while Bill‘
Bodle, last year’s regular, alternates between baseball and football '
practice. While at football practice Bodle ﬁlls in with the first and _
second team. A converted quarterback, Ed Assid, is running with
the.third team in place of injured fresh- '
man Jim Elmore. ~

Running behind Stewart at left half’-
back is another freshman Dewey Ches-
ter. Chester will be pushed from the
second unit job by Jim Dodaro, asopho-
more who saw limited action last season,
and who is currently on the injured list.

The lack of depth is also, pointed

against them. "He belongs on a all-opponent team,” one varsity
member moaned after running up against Flanigan.

Cecconi pointed out the" inexperience that plagues the backﬁeld -
when he said, “The young backs-will be carrying our second and
third backﬁelds. This is a healthy situation because the freshmen
are conscious of the fact and therefore, are working towards that
end.” '

Catcher Doug Chambers Seeks
Starting Role on Baseball Team

By PAT POLLlNO
Catcher Doug Chambers has pitcher

P JohniCarlis1e to thank for varsity exper-

ience he gained last year in his ﬁrst season
with the Panther baseball team. The two
were inseparable as battery mates, and

‘every time Carlisle walked out to the
V mound, Chambers simultaneously got the call to

handle the lefthander’s ' pitches.
The reason for the duo stems from a similar

' arrangement the two entertained while playing

for a sandlot team in Johnstown. Baseball coach
Bobby Lewis explained that Chambers got the
nod to catch Carlisle because “Carlisle felt more

~ at ease with him catching. He threw the ball
. ‘hard, and Chambers had very few passed balls.”

Lewis said Chambers could “anticipate Car-

lisle’s best pitches.”

But with Carlisle having used up his playing

B eligibility, Chambers can no longer claim the
distinction of “spot starter,” nor does he want to.

His goal is that of full-time catcher, and his

‘ competition for that honor is several-deep.

“We have three upperclassmen battling for

A catcher —- Chambers, (Tim) Grgurich and '(Bill)

Bodle,” said Lewis. __“Whichever one shows me
he can hit gets the call.”

Lewis added that three freshmen also are
trying out for. catcherzi Nick Butera, "Randy
Valentine and Guy. Bucci.

Chambers believes, it was his poor showing
at the plate last year which hurt his chances for
a regular starting role. Having batted a meager‘
.167, he blames “turning away from the ball”
and “pressing” as ﬂaws which promoted his
batting woes.

_ “I was taking my eye off the ball when,I
swung,”. said Chambers, “and then I began to
press for hits.”

He vindicated himself as a hitter following -»
the ‘close of collegiate action by leading the
Johnstown baseball circuit in batting with a .400
average and also being voted Most Valuable
Player in the strong junior league there. Cham-
bers credits the Johnstown team’s manager with
pointing out his batting fault and helping him

. to correct it.

Lewis noticed the fault in Chambers’ swing,
claiming he was “swinging up on the ball.” He
said extra work in batting practice could not
cure him of the habit. However, he was quick to
add that “Chambers has been timing the ball
better this spring and meeting it solidly.

If Chambers’ bat should fail to win him a

After Starting Job

starting spot in the Panther lineup, his defensive
ability might atone for it. According to Lewis,
“Chambers possesses a~very quick and accurate
throw, probably the best on the squad in that
respect.” i ” ' C

Excusing the lumps he has received ‘while.
catching, Chambers feels that “playing any other
position would be dull.” A

He recalls an incident that occurred last sea-
son in a game against Ft. Belvoir. The service
team had started a rally and, in an effortito
keep it alive, sent a “midget” up to the plate to,
face southpaw Carlisle. -

“The guy was crouching so low, I had to
almost lie on , my stomach to catch Carlisle,”
said Chambers. “He was up there for a walk,
but John blazed three quick strikes past him.”

Chambers,‘ a lanky six—feet minus his spikes,
isn't looking forward to any more “midgets.”
However, he jokingly pointed out he would
stand on his head -and catch if it meant playing

regularly. A few base hits should be sufficient, ‘

according to Lewis.

Lewis Hopes to M 0179 Baseball  

Team Outside; Pitchers Ready

_ By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Inclement weather kept the baseball team inside last week, but

they hope to move outside today.

The indoor work hindered the

progress of the hitters and ﬁelders, according to coach Bobby Lewis,

but did not_ hurt his pitchers.

Lewis feels this year’s pitching squad will have a depth last
year's team did not have. “Last year we only had two or three good
pitchers, and after that, nothing. This year we have more depth.

“A lot of the pitchers who were on the team last year have come

along real strong this spring, and

job,” Lewis said, ‘9

One of these pitchers is Roger
Johnson. “He said he wants to
belour ace,” Lewis said. “He can
be if he wants.to be. Roger is a
good pitcher. He didn’t work“
—a lot last year, but when he
‘did, he was good. I don’t see
why he shouldn’t bejust as good
or better this year.”

-Another pitcher returning from

last year’s squad is Andy Alex.‘

Alex was a regular two years ago,
but was a miserable disappoint-
mentlast year, giving up ﬁve runs
in the only two innings he pitch-
ed. Lewis is counting on the, curve-
baller this year,‘ and thinks Alex
is ready to move into the Pan-
ther’s starting rotation.

Dave Blyshak is another po-
tential member .of the Panthers’
regular pitching corps. Although
a newcomer to the Panthers, Lewis

is pleased with the lefthanderf

“I’m very impressed with Bly-
shak,” Lewis said.’ “He’s a very
pleasant" surprise. . '
' .“He has a lot of control for
a lefthander, and he is much
quicker than I anticipated.”
Lewis is also happy about Dave
Sauer, who pitched for the Pan-
thers last year. “Dave is coming
along very well," Lewis said. “This

should be a bigjyear for him.".

Rees Calls Sprints Strong Point
Of Track Team for This Season

By HOWARD AINISMAN
“Our strength will be in the
short distances this‘ year,”
said Panther track coach Carl
Rees. “Bill DelVecchio and

Dick Crout will probably be our
highest scorers.

“The 220-yard dasli will be our?

strongest event if DelVecchio is
healthy; right now he is recover-
ing from a pulled muscle he re-
ceived indoors. Crout ran well in-
doors and I’m expecting .a lot from
him in the ".100, 220 and 440-yard
dashes.” _ ‘
Rees plans to use Crout, Bob
Buell and Mike Slutsky in the 440.
Al Thomassey will compete in the
shot pu-t and discus, and a new-
comer to the team, Richard Lay-
ton, will throw the javelin. _

might not do too badly. We de-
ﬁinitely will be better outdoors
than indoors.

“Also, if Friend is sound he can
win’most of his -races, and the
distance men will have to work
hard to win their events. The
‘weather has been so bad that we
have not had too much time to
practice. This might hurt us in
our early meets.”

The Panthers .will open ‘their
season April 18 with ‘Navy at the
Stadium. “It will .probably be our

toughest meet,”__ said Rees. The

Panthers will also face Morgan
State, Penn‘ State, West Virginia,
.Syracuse and ‘Ohio University,
during‘ the coming season. '
