In an effort to obtain increased
educational appropriations from

the state legislature, Student Gov- .

ernment (SG) President Larry Platt
outlined plans yesterday for the
collective mobilization of campus
media and organizations toward
swaying the Harrisburg vote.

The focus of the ‘effort will be a
“Blitz Day," according /to Platt,
utilizing , the aggregate voice of
groups such as the Pitt News, the
Black Action Society, the Pan
Hellenic Association and the Com-

. muter Association.

The speciﬁc plans for Blitz Day,
scheduled for April 3, include the
establishment of information
booths” by SG, to provide students
with addresses and instructions for
writing state legislators; intensive
advertising in the Pitt News and on
WPGH radio; student access to the.
WATS/ Line’ to Harrisburg; and
distribution of information.

"The thrust of our attack will be
coordinated with the administra-
tion," said Platt. “Students as a
group don't wield enough.bargain-
ing power to do this alone;we’ve
got to go through the proper
channels." '

Platt said he's optimistic, that Pitt
can get up to a 12% increase in

appropriations from the state--if

students make legislators aware
that enrollment may drop with
overburdening tuition hikes. -

“This school ‘has a blue-collar.

base," Platt said. “A significant
number of studetns cannot afford

t to stay here if the tuition rises.

These students must personally
alert their state representatives
about this problem.”

Governor Milton J. Shapp, in his
budget proposal released last
week, recommended a $65 million
allocation .for Pitt, leaving the
University far short of its need.

Platt said the administration plans
to do anything it can to raise the
appropriation, especially by _utili-
zing student pressure.

“We've got to make sure;
though," warned Platt, “that all
increased appropriations we help

l

t1 ¢i4i¢¥'té1lY”"‘

      

‘the administration to get will go

toward minimizing tuition in-
creases and not raising faculty
salaries."

Student groups met with Univer-
sity officials as early as February
26, in a coalition of the undergrad-
uate Student Government, the
Graduate Professional Student As-
sociation and the General Studies
Student Cabinet to determine the
best method of action by students
to effect a change in state alloca-
tions.

Muriel Shopp Dedicates I 
New WPIC Child Clinic

BY VALERIESTRUBLE
Muriel Shapp, wife of Governor
Milton Shapp. Was at Pitt Monday

to dedicate the John Merck unit for

retarded and emotionally disturbed
children at Western ‘Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic.-’(WPIC).'

The ten bed unit, created by Dr.
Irene Jakab and funded by the
John Merck Foundation, provides
housing, therapy, and classrooms
for three-to ten-year-old patients
exhibiting symptoms of both
mental retardation and emotional
disturbance.

.“That’s why this program is so
exciting,"‘said Shapp, who has a
degree in family therapy from
George Washington University.
“They’ll deal with both problems
rather than focusing on one and

neglecting the other, as has been ,

done in‘ the past. And,- the
treatment will be fun; the unit
doesn't even look like an institu-
tion.”

The sixth floor

with brightly colored furniture.
Gingerbreadman mirrors and large
circular crawlspaces were designed
for the children.

“It's just beautiful. I enjoy going

Senate Snags on Tax-ciuf  

‘r
/,

Over Oil Loophole Rider

WASHINGTON AP— Senate de-
bate on the largest tax cut in the
nation's history bogged down
Tuesday in a skirmish that indi-
cated failure for efforts to totally
repealthe oil depletion allowance.

However. senators favoring a
reduction in the oil industry tax
break claimed that two preliminary
votes show they have the strength
to pass a compromise. .

Most ‘of the ﬁrst ()‘/2 hours of

debate on the $29.2-billion tax cut,
recommended by the Senate Fi-

nance Committee were taken up by
discussion of thedepletion allow-
ance, which gives a $2.5-billion-a-
‘year tax break to the oil and natural
gas industry. ‘

But one 58-38‘ vote indicated the
Senate generally supports the size
of the » tax cut voted by the
committee, rather than the $19.9-
billion cut approved by the House
and the $16.2-billion reduction
favored by President Ford.

The opening debate on the bill
emphasized that the biggest fight
in the Senate will come over the oil
depletion allowance.

Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
leader of the bloc seeking to totally

repeal the allowance--as the House .

earlier voted to do--ﬁled a petition

. to choke off an expected oil-state

filibluster against repeal. The first
debate-closing votegwill come on
Thursday.’ ' '

In two confusing votes which split
party ‘and ideological lines, the
Senate: ii

——Refused on a 60-35 vote. to
table, or kill, two amendments
aimed at reducing the depletion
allowance.

One amendment. by Hollings.
would repeal the allowance entire-
ly.

The second, by Sen. Alan Crans-
ton, D-Calif., wuld repeal the
allowance for the marjor oil com.-,

panies but permit an exemption for,

the_ first 3.000 barrels of oil
produced daily by smaller; inde-
pendent ‘producers.

—Rejected 49 to 41 an effort by
Hollings to allow a 1,00-barrel-per

day exemption for these indepen-»

dents. ,
It was generally agreed that-any
further‘ efforts to repeal the 22 per

'3

cent depletion allowance outright

will fall. A
‘ Whatever depletion language may
be written into the Senate tax-cut
bill will have to be reconciled in
c"onfer'ence with the outright repeal
voted by the House. »

‘By a 58-38 vote. the Senate...-““5__,.

' rejected a motion by Sen. George

McGovern, D-S.D. ordering the
Finance Committee to reduce the
$29.2—billion proposal tax cut ‘to the

intend to move as fast as I can on
them."

Assistant Student Affairs Vice-
Chancellor Bill Markus also was

,_"/-sleeased with the results of the

 

coiiimission. “A few technical
points will have to be worked out,”
he said. “But none of the ‘

recommendations present anything
we would have to make major
adjustments on.”

WALTER GLAZER

Markus said Student Affa'irs
hopes to meet with leaders of the

three student governments and the '
Pitt News to review the ﬁndings. /

“The complete implementation of

 proposal rests with the

’.\

ag\reement of the principles in-
volved,” he said.

Markus lauded the commission
for the time and effort put intoithe
Pitt News study.
, “The results of the study are very
reasonable. Every recommendation
put forth was grounded in
substance,” Markus stated.

 of the principles Markus
referred‘ to is the undergraduate
Student Government Board. Presi-
dent Larry Platt said the commis-
sion dealt with the major issues. He
was initially pleased with many of
the recommendations.

 

  
   

“Although the Pitt News is a
unique student organization, it still
went through the normal alloca-
tions procedures," Platt explained.
“What was needed were stated,
separate ﬁscal guidelines.

“The paper has to be ﬁscally and
operationally accountable to some-
one," he said.

Platt said the commission’s
suggestions would be reviewed
closely by members of Student
Government pending their meeting
with Moye. '

Study Commission Chairman
Walt Glazer, a history professor,
was pleased with the commission’s
ﬁndings. “It was quite remarkable

-that all members of the commission

ﬁnally signed the report,” he said.

Student Publications Advisor
David Tive, a commission member,
also strongly endorsed the report

and pledged to work toward
implementation. -
“The report is good. It’s

comprehensive enough to deal with

all problems facing the Pitt News,"
he said. “Yet it isn’t so detailed it
doesn't give the Pitt News and the
University room to adapt and
adjust.f'

Former Pitt News Editor-in-Chief
Scott Macleod said the commission
presented a very strong proposal.
Macleod had suggested formation
of the commission to Moye and
served as a commission member.

“We worked very tediously to
bring together all the different
viewpoints and ideas. of the
members," he said.

“Very simply, the proposal frees
the paper from the political
haggling that has characterized its
relationship with student govern-
ment and the administration in the
past,” Macleod said.

If implemented, the proposals
would benefit both the staff of the
paper and the University commun-
ity by allowing the Pitt News to
produce an expanded and better
newspaper, he added.

Alleged Oil Import Fraud
Costing America ~$e Billions

WASHINGTON AP — Possible
oil supply fraud\schemes costing
American consumers billions of
dollars are being investigated by
the federal government, a spokes-
man forjthe US Customs Service
says. ‘

The massive investigation centers
on the rapid rise of prices during
the Arab oil embargo and spokes-
man Mark McCormick said it deals
with schemes “probably involving
fraud.” '

The schemes may have resulted in
overcharges to US consumers of
billions of dollars. ‘

Among the rinvestigatio'ns‘is one in
Los Angeles where, customsagents
are reportedly looking into pur-
chases by the Los Angeles Depart-
ment of Water and Power.

An agent has made three or four
visits to check records of the
department, John Russell, a buyer
for the department, told The Asso-
ciated Press. But he said he “can’t
talk about what the agent was
looking at because it’s part of a
grand jury investigation...’ ’

Russell said as far as he knows the
probe involves only one company in

Los Angeles but he declined to say
which one. '

The Washington Post reported
Sunday customs agents were
checking purchases by the ‘depart-
ment of oil .at $25 a barrel, ﬁve
times.what it had paid before the
embargo.

Russell said there was one in-
stance where the department paid
$25 a barrel for 150,000 barrels of
oil from Peru through Cirillo Bros.
Co. of New York.

The next highest amount paid was
more than $24 per barrel for one
million barrels from Coastal States
Marketing in Houston, he said.

“Another term-contract subject to
escalation was a joint offering from
International Gas Traders of Lu-
gano, Switzerland, and Petrobay,
Ltd., a Bahamas Corporation with
offices in Quincy, Mass. During the

‘height of the escalation, the price
-was more than $24 a barrel, when

you include transportation, which .

77!

we arranged separately.... he
added.

Russell declined to say whether
any of the ﬁrms he mentioned was

the one under investigation.

The US in Africa: A

Hidden Vietnam

,/

Dear Editor:

At long last, after thirteen years of
fighting, tens of thousands of
casualties and at least a hundred
thousand civilians lefthomeless,
the war for Eritrean independence
Eritreans ‘Peoples
Liberation Forces /(PLF) and the
Ethiopian army of occupation has
gained some measure of notice in
the United States.
belated coverage by "most of the
daily US press’ of the war in Eritrea
been marred ‘ by gross
distortions and serious omissions of
facts. A casual reader of even the
most ‘prestigious’ US daily papers,
would conclude the war in Eritrea
is either a civil war, a secessionist
movement, or worse, ‘a ‘religious

war between Muslim Eritreans and -
. Christian Ethiopians, none of
‘E which is true.’ ..
The American daily: press has said
very little about the extent and '
a harshness of atrocities perpetrated
on the‘ civilian population of Eritrea‘
~ of Ethiopia. Also, there has been

almost no mention of the degree of
US involvement, financially -and

politically, on the. side of the
to crush the‘

Ethiopian army
movement for I Eritrea’s indepen-
dence over the entire duration of
the war.  ~ I '

The observation that the current
situation in Eritrea is" either a civil
war or a secessionist ‘war is based
on the false premise that Eritrea is.
and has always been legally and
constitutionally an integral part of
Ethiopia. Yet, anyone who is
vaguely familiar with the recent
African political history will note
that despite Ethiopia’s forceful and
treacherous annexation of Eritrea
in 1962, Eritrea hasalways had-a
separate and ' different political,
cultural and‘ national identity. .

Long before -European colonialists
descended on Africa, independent
Eritrea was known" as ‘rnedre
Bahri’ (Land ;by the Sea).
consequence of the European
scramble for Africa during, the

eighteenth century, Eritrea became —

an Italian colony. It is interesting

‘to note that Emperor Menelik of

Ethiopia, through two ‘treaties of
friendship he signed with the
Italians in 1889 and 1900, recog-

nized Mareb River as the official I

boundary line that “sep'a‘rated

* Eritrea from independent Ethiopia.

The Italians conquered Ethiopia in
1935‘ but "they" lost Ethiopia and
Eritrea in 1941 to the British in the
course of World jWar_’ II.‘ The
British reinstated Haile Selassie in

Ethiopia but ‘.they kept Eritrea-

under British‘ administration‘ until
1952.

Before the British left Eritrea, the A

United Nations debated the issue of
former Italian colonies (Libya,
Somalia‘ and Eritrea).
granted independence to Libya and
Somalia and decided "to temporarily
join Eritrea and Ethiopia under _a

‘ federal charter for a period" of ten —

years. ‘At the end of this period, a

The -‘UN’ ~

 

    Lotte:-to the Editor

A -,.,,..ingah  rcingf g

UN supervised referendum would
be carried out to permit Eritreans
to decide their political future.
According to the provisions of the
UN designed charter, Eritrea
would have total autonomy in its
internal affairs. Furthermore, the
UN-drafted federal constitution
allowed Eritrea all the mechanisms
that make a democratic system of
government work. There was
freedom of speech and of press;
Eritreans were free to form and join
labor unions; there was universal
suffrage. There was a provision
that
members of Parliament and that of
the Chief executive of the State by
popular vote every four years.

-/ However, the new federal charter.

did not make‘ any demands on
Ethiopia to change its feudal and
.monarchical type of government to
correspond to-Eritrea’s democracy.
The role of Ethiopia in the federal’
union was to be limited to matters
of defense, foreign affairs and
foreign trade. In_ hindsight, one
would have to question whether the -
‘UN was really serious in attemp-
ting to graft a federal - union
between democratic Eritrea and
feudal and autocratic Ethiopia.
Perhaps the federal arrangement

was not designed to last very long, ._

at least as far as Ethiopia was
concerned. As the Eritreans soon
found out, Haile Selassie system-
atically chipped away at the federal-
machinery. In 1962, ‘the’ former
Lion .of Judah (who incidentally is
now caged in his own former
pal_a‘ce) consummated the annexa-
tion‘ of Eritrea to Ethiopia by
abolishing the Eritrean Parliament!
Almost ‘immediately, the Eritrean
Liberation‘ Movement was founded .
to wage’ an armed struggle to win»
back, Eritrea’s independence from
Ethiopia. ‘ * .

The argument that Eritrea is now
attempting to ;‘secede’ from
Ethiopia should
untenable in view of these
historical facts. Secession cannot

, be said to exist when there is no
legal _and constitutional link be-
tween two states, as is the case‘

_ between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Ethiopia’s unilateral annexation of
Eritrea has_ rendered ‘null and _void
any ,7 legal claim Ethiopia might.
.have"had over Eritrea. To confuse
the movement for national. libera-
tion as in Eritrea with secession-

, ists’ efforts toward separation‘ as in

Katanga or Biafra is’ to denigrate
the just struggle for self-determin-.
ation’. We can only accept the.
legality and constitutionality of

' Eritrea’s status as one of Ethiopia’s

provinces if ‘we-are willing to view
annexation as a legitimate method
of acquiring additional territories,

in which case, we will be forced to if

consider Mozambique as a pro-
vince of Portugal and ‘ Namibia
(South-West Africa) as part "of
South Africa. I

The war in Eritrea could only be '

considered aicivil war ifait can be
shownthat Eritreans were fighting

Eritreans. ,Yet the war is between :
Eritreans and -outsiders- ' In the, v ‘

final analysis, the war between
Eritrea and the Ethiopian army of
occupation is in no way different
from the recently concluded war
between FRELIMO and Portugal.

The objective of both struggles has
been’ the same--tofree the land
from foreign intrusion and domina-

African country does not make its
brand of colonialism less odious
than Portugal’s--a point distress-

strafing villages in northern
Eritrea, forcing a hundred_thous-

and Eritreans to flee across 

border to the Sudan to" live as '

refugees? Though rarely reported
in the US press, there have been
untold cases of Ethiopian massa-
cres of Eritrean civilians on a scale
far worse than My Lai.

In 1970, over 200 people, mostly
civilians, died in the Ethiopian
bombing of Keren. Last August,‘
250‘ civilians were massacred at Um
Hajer. In December 1974, the
Ethiopians used steel wires to
strangle to death 50 high schbol
students in Asmara. Since last
Februaryvmany small villages such
as Adi Nefas, Adi Segudo and Woki

Duba have been levelled ‘to the T

about “Here”, but for this lack of
precision I stand corrected. In

however, _I was speculating about

talking only about their experi-

I didnot say there should not be

Tried an Issue

Dear Editor; T

After reading some of the dia-
tribes recently in the PittgNews
about how the blacks have been‘ so
downtrodden ‘solely "because of

their color I thought I would write ‘

you a letter and-challenge your
/editorial fairness. I really don't

expect you to print this letter’
because it won’t agree "with many.

of the dogmas, that are passed for
truth these days. C

At any rate, here goes:
have been many stories in our
nation's presses lately about how
blacks are not really less intelligent
but only oppressed. ' This is
obviously a lie._— In this era. of the
scientific the experiment has al-
ready been performed in_ our public
schools._ To wit; ‘in situations where
black children have been pitted
against white children from about
the same cultural background and
blacks have consistently scored at
least 10 l.Q. points below the
whites. I know critics will say I.Q.
tests are weighed against the
blacks or the "tests _don’t measure
what is signiﬁcant but this is
basically a smokescreen to avoid
facing the reality that the tests are
correct-. The critics cannot answer
why it is that the Orientals and the
American "Indians have about the

same I.Q. _ 'Indeed,'the Orientals ,

rscore slightly higher. than the

Caucasian. ,1 don’t hear the whites ,

screaming about how the Orientals
have biased the tests against the
whites, nor do I hear the whites

saying that the tests don’t measure 

what is _important. These are
unpopular facts and they have not
received fair press coverage.

Indeed those people who are brave

enough to comment about them_

a ‘democracy’ where the truth is
s-upposedly held sacred! It seems it
is 'fair to expose our college
students to radical and sometimes
u.n-Americarfviewpyoints "all in the
name of freedom of speech but if
these same protectors of the press
don't agree with viewpoints then
the rules ar;e,changed.

End Research Blues   

BY M.A. CLINTON

With ﬁnals approaching fast and
all of us swamped with term papers
and projects--well, it is. just enough
to make a grown student cry.

But most people at Pitt don’t know
there is a saviour to free us from all
those term-ending research blues.

CBIS--The Campus Based Infor-

'mation System--is a research sys-

tem providing information quickly
and easily on practically any sub-
ject from Socialist Humanism to the
major concerns of the American
people in 1971.

Under the direction of Allen Kent,
CBIS was established in 1970 with

a grant from the National Science

Foundation.

The system provides a student
with the ability to go to any of the
networks’ computersand conduct a
search for information on his
research topic. CBIS will clarify
the questions and indicate relevant

resources to assist the researcher. A

All of this is done faster than an.
individual’s effort to pore through
the tons of abstracts and resources
available elsewhere.

Although CBIS covers only the
last several years, the system is not
limited by its own physicalrcapa-
city. The information available
maybe from oneof the University
libraries--or from a library in
Chicagoor Great Britain.

Technical assistance is offered to
those unfamiliargwith the system,
but learning how to conduct a
search is simple. A student can
make any future searches on his
own at any of the various computer
terminals around campus.

Information Utilization‘ Labora-
tories (IULS) are specific systems
of data bases available to research-
ers primarily in two areas--social
sciences and engineering sciences.

Located in G-12 Mervis Hall and
Benedum Hall’s Bevier Library,

these two IULS provide biblio-
graphic bases, literature and ideas
for proposal writing on topics
speciﬁally oriented toward engi-
neers and social scientists.

Another indispensible IUL is the
New York Times Information Bank.
This computer provides access to
all the"news that has appeared in.
the New York Times. \

Linked directly to the New York
Times office in New York, the
researcher can plug in a topic area
at the computer in the basement of
Hillman Library and _all of the
sources available in any editions of
the Times will appear on the
computer screen. ‘The researcher
then goes to a microﬁche collection
and reads the actual article.

This search on any topic takes
only minutes, cutting hours of
paging through bound volumes of
the New York Times Index.

Data bases are available in other
areas, ranging from chemical ab-
stracts to educational resources.

All the data bases_at Pitt are
named PIRETS, the Pittsburgh
Information Retrieval System. By
going to one of the computer
terminals and getting‘ I a CBIS
Programmer Number, any re-,~
searcher can have access to all the
available data bases.

The CBIS is a service provided
free to all students and faculty
members". This innovative method
of collecting information and utiliz-
ing it in a research project is
available to, anyone interested
enough to visit one of the IULS.

Researching a topic is easy and
quick--although doing research
through ‘CBIS may not cure the
research blues, it certainly can

‘ make it a lot more fun.

For more information on CBIS,
students can either visit one of the
terminals or call x-5218--but only if
they’re serious in reducing their
research time. ‘ -

Ernest Sternglass, Pitt’s ‘director of radiology and author of Low-Level
Radiation. - \

Sa viar
BY BILL HADUCK -

.On a sticky city Indian Summer
morning at seven o’clock, when
half the doctors in Scaife Hall walk
slowly through the corridors with
no white coats, the air conditioning
being off,_ a bed-rufﬂed Ernest
Sternglass softly clicks a classroom
door behind him. - .

“Somebody had the right idea,”
he grins through his light foreign
accent.‘ “Somebody took all the
erasers from all the classrooms.”
He laughs as he wipes somebody’s
leftover "knowledge from the \
blackboard with the palm of his
hand. I . V_

He turns to the eight man class,
slouching at their desks, struggling
to wake open their minds to the A.
mounds of X-ray terminology they
know he is about to pour in. He
laughs ‘again. “All right, who went
down for the coffee and donuts?”

For a _man who ﬁve years ago
warned 1,260,250 Americans their
children might soon be" deadf”
Ernest Sternglass laughs too much.

He doesn’t seem to have the class,
the savoir faire, to have written an
article for Esquire. His hair is short

and oily, his grey flannel suit is
actually the remains of two grey
flannel suits, and his shoes are
brown.

But in the fall of 1969, it was his
article, he claims, that helped turn
the tide against development of a
nuclear ABM system, thereby
saving the world’s children and so
the human species, from the
possible extinction the deployed
ABM's radioactive fallout would
have brought.

‘‘I’m. just one of the assholes who

Ernest Sternglass: Sa viar 0f the Damned

(Continued on Page 7)

at god-awful hours‘. Five o'clock in
the morning. Descartes wasn't
used to that kind of thing, but he
went anyway. A few months later,
Rene Descartes was dead."

Sternglass laughs as if a superior
had told the story. _

Scaife Hall is beginning to come
alive now. Some of the doctors
carry steaming cups of coffee. It
smells good. Sternglass doesn’t
seem to notice.

‘_‘I hate to get up in the morning
and not lay in my bathtub and
think," he says. “There're a lot of
unconscious processes that go on
when you're asleep in bed. You
have to have some time to let them
out.”

For a guy as famous as Sternglass
should be, having appeared on the
Huntley-Brinkley Report, the
Today Show, and the CBS Morning
News with his radiation theories,
very few people acknowledge his
presence in the hall.

His close associate, Dr. Donald
Sashen, sits by a big _desk in front
of a wall-mounted lit-up X-ray
viewing screen. “Yeah, he’s a nice
guy," Sashen says. “Very
courteous. I've been working with
him for about seven years and he’s
a very friendly guy. He was born in
Germany but came over here as a
child. He's basically an Amer-
ican.”

In his small tidy office, Sternglass
sits in front of a sooty window that
leaks some early morning light.

“I grew up in Germany when the
Nazis came to power,” he says,
now with no laughter. “I had

firsthand experience with a gov-
ernment betraying its own people.
No one in Germany really knew
what was going on. No one knew
what his country was really doing.

“I got the beginnings for my work
from my parents," he speaks now
in a lighter tone. “Both my parents
were physicians, my father a
They had x-rays
and ultraviolet lights right in the
office. I couldn't help being
interested and it turned into a
life-long thing.

Sternglass speaks of the course of
his life and the development of
atomic theories as if they were
related.

“When I was a young child, the
atomic theory was formed. The
neutron was discovered when I
became a youngster and when I
was a college student, fission was
discovered. So it developed as I
developed. I couldn’t help being
interested.

“One thing to remember is with
all the plus factors of radiation and
the atom, I heard the negative
factors, too. I heard the dangers of

radiation discussed right at my ‘

father's dinner table.”

Sternglass became concerned
about the effects of radioactive
fallout while working for Westing-
house Research Laboratories in the
fifties.

In the midst of the great national
debate over fallout shelters, the
Pittsburgh Federation of American
Scientists conducted a study of the
effects of a nuclear attack on
Pittsburgh, and Sternglass was
picked to assess the effects of low

level radiation.

“As I continued my work, I found
that for every megaton detonated
on the earth's surface, there would
eventually be_ 10,000 deaths. And
what they were talking about at the
time were 500 megaton bombs.. I
realized the whole fallout shelter
idea was futile.

“I could no longer just pursue my
work, there would be no one to read
my articles. I had to preserve my
audience." Sternglass is delighted
with his way of putting it. “Heh
Heh Heh Heh," his German accent
grows heavier. “I had to preserve
my audience.

“My ideas were unconventional
and they went against what the
governments wanted the public to
believe. It’s difficult to get those

' kinds of ideas published.”

Sternglass‘ head tilts to the floor
and his tone is almost solemn.

“My book tried to bring out in the
open the effects of all this
radiation. You won't find it in the
library, don't worry, it's out of

print." He brings his voice down
almost to a whisper. “And the
publisher burned the remaining
copies." He pauses a moment.
“Under pressure from the govern-
ment and the AEC." The
laughing, joking Sternglass has his
eyes to the floor.

“So when it came out that fallout
shelters were not going to save
mankind, the military tried to
deceive the public with something
else.

“The ABM’s give you the illusion
of safety. They're like seatbelts in
cars. If you have a seatbelt on you
can go ninety miles an hour and
nothing will happen to you, right?
The ABM was the seatbelt of the
military." He returns to his
previous mood.

“Building larger and larger
bombs was all right, they tried to

tell us, as long as we had the ABM _

to knock down the Russian or
Chinese ones.

“They didn't -say the resultant
fallout would end life. It would

have been just one of those ‘Oh,
sorry about that.’ " He rocks back
in his chair, laughing again.

“It's the same with the nuclear
power plants. The valves start
rusting and corroding and radio-
activity starts leaking and you can't
smell it or taste it or see it, so you
just let it "go and the public never
finds out until the milk from the
cows grazing in a field next to the
plant is shown to contain strontium
90.

“People are human, they're too
human and they try to fool
themselves. You tend to believe it
isn't so bad. Nobody wants to be
the messenger of bad news. Kings
used to shoot the messengers of
bad news."

Sternglass looks at his watch,
frowns, but continues. “We have
to get our message across. We’re
creating a world we might not be
able to live in. Remember the
dinosaur? His brain was too small
to handle the events in his world.
We might be just like the
dinosaurs.”

’ BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Today the motion picture industry
is experiencing a renaissance.
Look at the Pittsburgh first-run
houses. They boast of such
superflicks as Earthquake, The
Towering Inferno, The Godfather

/ Part II, Young Frankenstein, Lenny

and Murder On The Orient
Express, all- of which have broken
box-ofﬁce records here, are still
playing and will have long runs.

phenonienon, it is a national one as
well. In contrast to our stagflating
economy, the movie business is

‘ feeling booming times.

Commercial theaters /are not the
only onesfenjoying the new gold
rush. Collegepcircuit theaters also
are boasting box-office block-
busters.

Here at ‘the university, the
Franklin Pangborn Film Society is
enjoying its most successful season
of film programming since the club
was founded in 1970.

Several weeks’ ago, Pangborn
presented Last Tango In Paris,
which was the biggest grossing
The
picture grossed over—- $2,300 in
addition to setting a record for most
advance ticket sales--1,040 advance
tickets were sold.

The Franklin Pangborn Film
Society is a University recognized
student organization founded ﬁve
years ago by Pat O'Brien, who felt

seeing movies or in making them.
Hence, Pangborn serves two
functions--filmmaking and film
programming. Iniprogramming,
the club sponsors the Thursday
night film series that consists
mostly of foreign and art pictures.
The series is screened in Lawrence
Hall‘ at 8:30 pm. Admission is
$1.00. Some notable ﬁlms already

,5“-<-hown have included ilngmar
' g”B'ei‘-gman’s Cries And Whispers,

‘ for its members.

_Fedrico Fellini’s Fellini Satyricon
and Roman Polans_ki's Knife In The
Water.

In contrast, the Saturday~night.

series features popular ﬁlms such
as The Godfather, Bananas and
Butch Cassidy And The Sundance
Kid. These ﬁlms are also shown in
Lawrence Hall at 7:00 pm and 9:30
pm. The admission price is $1.00
or $.75 for‘advance tickets available
at the Student Union Ticket Ofﬁce.

Both series are open to- students,
faculty and alumni of the Uni-

. versity. -
-:’‘-\On the filmmaking aspect, the‘

club provides most equipment and
services necessary to make a movie
The equipment
included three super-eight camer-
as, two 16 mm cameras, lights,
light meters, two editing machines
and a camera tripod, while the

_ services include film processing.

Who is Franklin Pangborn and
why is theclub named after him?
Any connoisseur of good cinema
should be able to ‘tell-you Franklin
Pangborn was an obscure comedy
‘actor in the *1930s and 19405 who
played in numerous W.C. Fields

connected in any way with Marxist
groups today).

According to Pat O’Brien,~ the-

club, Franklin ‘ an'ghor'nt’s., name.

was selected.-?as\..the _club’.s nam

because the name would make the
organization distinguished from
other University clubs and area
film societies. The name would
make the club sound like an elite
group.

Having such a strange sounding
name is no impediment for the
club. With the attendance at
Pangborn's two ﬁlm_ series in-
creasing, the name Franklin
Pangborn has become another
household word around campus
like Wesley Posvar.

“This. term is.a very successful
one for us. We’ve shown a‘ proﬁt

dent, said, “What is surprising

or more obscure type movies that

normally do not have a massi

audience appeal.

‘‘It should be pointed out the.
audience for Saturday night movies
is different from the Thursday
ﬁlms," Choi said. “The Saturday
crowd comes mainly for enter-
tainment purposes, while the
Thursday’ night audience attends to
see pictures for academic
scholarly purposes. These Thurs-
day people have an intense interest
in movies."

Yeager added, “This term nec-
essary and drastic changes oc-
curred in our movie schedules with
the introduction of the old
Hollywood classics such as Howard
Hawks‘ His Girl Friday into the
Thursday lineup and the Hum-
phrey Bogart festival‘ into the
Saturday films.

“The audienceresponse was just
overwhelming and I think indicates
a trend of interest in the old
Hollywood star pictures like those
with Gable, Bogart and Katherine
Hepburn.\

“As a result, we will be including
moreof these old classics into our

fall schedules now being planned." .

was senior John Brugos, who said,
"l think showing these classic ﬁlms
is just an okay idea because you can
see them on television every now
and then." ' .

Brugos, who regularly attends the
Pangborn films, added, “Pangborn
has an excellent selection of movies
and in reality. these films are a lot
cheaper than the ones that play at
regular theaters. The only
difference is you have ‘to wait a
while longer until pictures like Last
Tango In Paris become available to
colleges.” —

Freshman Dave Reeder. who
occasionally attends Pangborn

are generally good,-I like to see
and Pangborn has
already had several comedies that
appealed to me like Butch Cassidy

“I like Pangborn‘s movie selec-

Mass Outdoor Migration 

centrating on Susan Blakely as the 
pretty undercover -and playing up ‘
the sexual angle.

BY M.C. PILECKI

Time now to visit the neighbor-
hood theatres to see what the ﬁlm
industry is putting out to encourage
people to stay outdoors and enjoy
spring. rather than be trapped in a
stuffy old moviehouse.

Right now ’tis the season for the
borderline flicks to be shown. so
pap from the major Easter releases
looks good by comparison. You’ll
be safer sticking to kite-flying.

Report to the Commissioner is a
basically trashy movie that is
mildly, coarsely entertaining and--
if it would have been done with a
little more class--had the potential
to be a first-rate film. The movie is
another one of those realistic cop
epics, slightly better executed than
Supercops, but with a little less
commercial mastery than Serpico.

Like the latter, Report is told
mostly ﬂashback about the making
of a big scandal that rocks the New
York City police force. You’d think
by now the NYPD has had so many
“scandals" that any more occur-
rences would be anything but
“scandalizing. ‘ ' '

So anyway, again like Serpico,
this story is the somewhat factual
account of a young, very idealistic
cop getting messed up in The
System. Only this dude isn't a
“good cop” like Serpico. Just a
naive kid. And by a device that still
doesn’t wash logically, he unwit-
tingly gets himself involved in an
undercover agent’s_ assignment
and seems destined to break her
cover when he accidentally shoots
her.

won awards from the New York-

inees .Gena Rowlands and Ellen
Burstyn--and several directors--in-
cluding Peter Bogdanovich, Arthur
Penn. and John Cassavettes--to
place protest ads in The New York
Times to show how peanut-minded
the ruling was and to pressure the
Board into amending its decision.

The Board’s unanimous vote not
to amend"its rule concerning the
eligibility of television ﬁlms for
Academy Awards’was supported
by editorials in the Los Angeles
Times and the Hollywood Reporter.

The January 28 Reporter editorial
said, “The time to change rules...
must follow awardsnow inthe
works. Let’s not make up new
rules as we go along."

As it stands, the. Board’s ruling
has far-reaching implications.

‘ First, the ruling raises the question

whether it is fair to declare
ineligible for Oscars a movie shown
on foreign television and exhibited
commercially in the_United States.

Further, the ruling cheats such
highly acclaimed film artists as
Bergman out of the recognition
they deserve for their works such
as Scenes From a Marriage.

Most importantly, will the ruling
drive ﬁlmmakers like Bergman
from permitting their works to be
exhibited here commercially in the
‘United’ States? '

Last October, Academy President
Walter Mirish, acting on the advice
of the entire ‘Board, directed the
rules committee to investigate
thoroughly all the. implications of
revising the current ruling.

For the time being, the Academy
appears to be acting like a bunch of

backyard provincials from the Dark ,

Ages.

(Continued from Page 8)
Elwood queries, “Could it be said
that the themes of God, sin and
redemption bring out the best in
science fiction authors?" This re-
viewer can offer only a categorical
“maybe.“

The opening selection, “The
Problem of Pain” by Poul Ander-
son, examines the eternal question
of evil and suffering as they are
permitted to thrive in the universe
by a supposedly benevolent God.
On a planet inhabited by fervent
adherents to “death-pride,". crea-
tures resist the final breath, seek-
ing to “give God honor” through
the extended endurance of great
pain. _

‘Students of social history who
have scrutinized the excesses of

--nationalistic societies are familiar

with various strains. of ‘death-pride

in which the state is the supreme
being. Science ﬁction, however, is _

not indispensable to the issue

portrayed in Anderson's story,
and, therefore, through its inherent
weakness only cheapens such a
digniﬁed philosophical question.
Edward D. Hoch’s “The Wolfram
Hunters” proves to be more satis-
fying to the well-read than the
preceding tale, but the significance
of religion to the plot is only
tangential, to say the least. The
story reads more like a suspenseful
mystery [a murder has been com-
mitted] than theological specula-
tion. ‘ -
An excellent moral discussion, on
the other hand, is maintained
throughout “The Gift of Nothing”
by Joan C. Holly." An exploration
team from planet Earth bargains
with the gentle natives of Kana for
mining settlements. A. member of
the team with a strong Indial
heritage foresees the social and

cultural devastation that lies ahead .
.if the Kanans accept “modern

progress” on their planet.

resplendent in a— metallic coat and

suspicious appearance of the
imprisoned man. So he goes to
fetch a judge. The ensuing trial is
the most bizarre scene of all.
The most appealing aspect of the
show is its staging. Making
audiences wander‘ through the
maze is clever. But the production
uses [the labyrinth in other ways;
performers are hidden’ behind the

innermost ring of sheets. This
really makes the audience a part of

‘the show,’ as does the close

proximity of actors to the theatre-

goers. V
Once again, ’ the acting was
memorable, particularly by the,

_ beer-swilling judge. The trapped

man is caught by his own logical
mind. But audiences of the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre
production can follow the maze to
an engrossing, provocative pro-

‘ duction.

His disagreement with the other
members of the crew projects a
broader struggle between consci-
ence and duty, as the explorers
have been sworn to accomplish

, their mission. Holly also portrays a

missionary responsible for the con-
version of the natives to “Standard
Christianity;” he is a relevant

example of the breed of theologians "

who adjust their religion to com-
plement their personal motiva-
tions.

Significantly, the last story in the
anthology, Ray Bradbury’s “In
This Sign” concerns itself with the
forms of ‘intelligent life on other
worlds and poses a question sel-
dom taken seriously:are all high
forms of - life -necessarily human-
oids? This is analogous to the
situation in which the Old ,World
explorers found themselves pon-
dering whether native Americans
had souls. _

Such a ridiculous question is
readily scoffed at today, but now
we have the vantage point of five
centuries of ethno-history and can

'appreciate the difficulty of the

situation . only when _ ‘confronted
with a similar question of our own.
And Bradbury more than confronts
us with it--he calls it to haunt.
Such excellent speculation as put

forth in “In This Sign” is one_

example of the growing defense
science ﬁction has in its struggle
for acceptance as a mature genre.
Yet there are still too many" tales of
mysterious, devastating weapons
and hideous perversions of earthly
creatures, designed merely to im-
press us with,their sheer fantasy.
Such stories make their -way into
cartoon strips, _not ripened liter-
ature. A J '

mances by ﬁrst-rate international

Ten Little Indians, on the other
hand, has a cast of second-raters in
a third-rate production. This movie
is good proof a ﬂick can’t rely solely
on a good plot. There are also
matters of characterization, set-
ting, direction and acting without
which a movie falls apart. We’ll
have to wait for a fourth edition
before Ten Little Indians ever gets
it together.

Some movies ﬂash through town

them. Such was the case with
Phantom of the Paradise a few
weeks back. For some incalculable
reason, Phantom just hasn’t made
a good go of it at the box office, but
it is not inconceivable to see this
ﬂick eventually coming back as a
sleeper.

Phantom is basically a rock ver-
sion of Phantom of the Opera, with
heavy overtones of The Picture of
Dorian Grey and Faust. Directed
and writtenby Brian DePalma (of
the gory Sisters fame),-Phantom is
in a few instances tight and

seemingly under control, but more -

often than "not comes across with
“the hysteria of a Ken Russel ﬂick,
with little similarit to reality, but
not quite. The rock world is one

that in itself has little similarity to
reality, and tearing it apart and
exposing it on celluloid in such
wild, seemingly random satire as in
Phantom can mistakenly appear to
be pure groundless exaggeration.
Actually, there's a lot more truth in
Phantom concerning the rock in-
dustry than one would think of in a
horror movie. But then, the rock
industry is pretty much like a
horror movie. '

The drugs, the. artist ripoffs, the
denigration of women, the inhu-
man coldness of the business are
all part of the movie as much as of
reality, but they are portrayed so
excessively, so overwhelmingly,
they take on the same air of
overdone ﬁction as the very idea of
the Phantom.

The story, by the way--in case you
didn’t know from the original--con-
cerns a rock impressario, Swan (a

Phil Spector-type), who shafts a '

young composer out of his life’s
work, a rock opera based on Faust.
After various degradations, the
young composer is horribly mutil-
ated in a record press, and ﬁnally
chooses to haunt Swan’s great rock
house, the Paradise, which looks
exactly like a decayed opera house
left o_ver from another phantom.

There’s some’ good music com- 

posed by Paul Williams [who
portrays the evil Swan] used to
good advantage in the opera

scenes. There are a number of
cameo pot-shots taken at some of

. the rock biggies, all of which may

not be apparent first time around.
The movie is made pretty much like
one thinks of a rock opera being
done--excessive, gross and losing
its grip on reality fairly quickly.
It’s this total unconcern with logic
that probably has put off audi-

ences. This isn't a movie you get a
quick impression of. It may take
you a few days--or a few weeks"--to
decide if you liked it or not. It’s a
strange ﬂick that will be good to
catch on the rebound.

The Crazy World of Juliur Vroo-
der wasn't worth much the first
time around. It would have made a
good “now” ﬂick back in 1968--but
it wasn't ready for release until
1974. As it is, it seems hopelessly
dated and naive--like watching a
remake of a 1930s “sophisticated
comedy."

The ﬁlm concerns a young Viet-
nam veteran, Julius Vrooder (Tim-
othy Bottoms looking as impish as
possible), in a stateside hospital
trying to convince everyone he’s
crazy. It’s sort of another Catch-22
in reverse: if you act crazy, you
really can't be.

Naturally, he’s really rebelling
against a world that created a crazy
war in which he tried to save the

‘lives of an old woman and child,

and instead was awarded a medal
for killing them. He spends time in
the hospital being impossibly cute

, and mischievous, with his only

friends [symbolism time, folks] a
World War I vet and a World War
H vet.

He falls in love with a nurse,
Zannie (Zany--get it?), played by

ever. She’s awfully dizzy for a

come the evils of age and the phone

al establishment, and everyone
lives happily ever after.

The only‘ lead the Cats were able
to get came‘ at the outset when Lew

points against Bill McAndrew’s

Friars their ﬁrst lead 6-S‘. Kirk
Bruce countered with an outside
jumper to give the lead back to the '

- Panthers, 7-6, with just two min-

utes gone-in the game.

After a Pitt time-out, Hassett
scored his first basket from well
outside to put Providence back in

an awesome offensive display,
taking shot after shot as the Cats

desperately ‘tried to come up with a *

Pitt also was seriously bothered

Icers’ Coach Praises 5.. ire Teaml

BYSTEVESYBERT

Fresh from an impressive cham-
pionship victory in the -Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hoc-
key League playoffs and looking
forward to the. Rotary Tournament

-in April, the Pitt Hockey Club has

taken some time off to savour its
season success.
Head coach Len Barcalow had

squad, which compiled an overall

19-2-1 record, undefeated at 14-0 in
the WPIHA.

“Everybody on this team puts out
198%." he said. “The other 2% is

when we're‘ changing lines. I would

say that all 20 guys on this year's
team are All-Stars."
The Panthers rolled over every

league opponent to gain their
fourth title in as many years,
running up astronomical scores,

;-A..
7‘'“K

 «such as 20-0, 13-2, 12-2 and 11-1,

over their weaker foes. The Cats
also handled on three occasions
Carnegie-Mellon. the league's only
other respectable team. outscoring
the Tartans 20-11. A

Pitt averaged nine goals in each of
its 14 WPIHA games, a feat
Barcalow had predicted long before
the season was under way.

“I said way back in September »

after our first few practices that
this team would score at least nine

‘ goals or more in every one of their

league games and it looks ' as
though the prediction has. held
up," he said. ‘

But the WPIHA is not exactly the
world's greatest collegiate hockey
league. and if you have ever gone

to the Civic «Arena to take in a’
game, you have probably seen for

yourself. It is ‘basically a league for

‘ hacks who resort to dirty play in an

attempt to beat a superior team like

 

Pitt with sticks. when they realize
they can't win with goals.
“The league’ [WPIHA] is all right

for. mediocre teams, but Pitt is far

from being mediocre,” commented
Barcalow. “Quite a few teams in
thisleague play unethical hockey’,
but there’s just no way these teams
are ever going to beat Pitt.”

if all goes right financially for the
Hockey Club. it will find itself out
of the second-rate league and into a
schedule with independent Eastern
teams already set for next season.
Only‘ lack of funds-can keep the

Panthers from reaching their goal. '

it is hoped that either Student‘
Government of the Athletic De-'

partment will wake upto the clubs
success‘ and lend a hand.

Through vigorous fund-raising
the Hockey Clubvhas managed to
eliminate its debt to the WPIHA
and partially erase several others.

responsible for getting the club out

the group of New York alumni also '

has proven helpful.“

“When the New York alumni.

enthused beyond any word about
our club. Again, for myself and the
guys on the team, we can’t thank
them‘ enough and it’s about time

reasons for the success of the

continued. “Through hishard work
he had a successful campaign and
all of us can't thank him enough.

whfere Juan Marichal, the 37-year-

Red Sox but better know as a San

Old Rival-i—Dadgers

Last year Marichal was shipped to
the American League Red Sox and
many Californians gave a sigh of
relief. But Juan was plagued by
both back troubles (which many
believed could be attributed to his
famous pitching motion kick) and
sore arm troubles. After all,
nemesis or not, he was getting old.

But the Dodgers looked past petty
rivalry and Marichal’s problems of
a year ago when they signed him in
his home in Puerto Rico.

LA Vice-President Al Campanis
said Juan agreed to a very nominal
contract (75 grand is nominal
considering Marichal was making
at least 100 grand in his heyday).

With 243 wins and only 131
losses, Marichal is second in
lifetime victories among active
players to another veteran of many
years,’ Bob Gibson of the St. Louis
Cardinals.

popular lefty reasons. “But it really
doesn’t matter; if you’re gonna

Few people have worked harder at
trying to attain such a difficult goal
than Siegle. Every day during the

 off-season (at Pitt, the off-season is

every month but March, April and
May), he played basketball and
paddleball, and threw frequently to
Olave. V

“If anything goes wrong, it won't
be because I didn’t give 100%,” he
says. He has matched that figure
with his mental attitude as well.

“l’ve been testing my mental
toughness these past two years,”
admits Siegle, mentioning the light
schedule and his arm miseries. “l
won’t'be going berserk. There’ll be
a controlled anxiety and controlled
competitiveness out there.”

Olave concurs. “Don has matured
