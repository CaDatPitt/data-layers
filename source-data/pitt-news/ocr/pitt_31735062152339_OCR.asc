Bi t Game-

Well, it seegiggs that there will be*
a football game at the stadium to-
morrow afternoon between Pitt and
Notre Dame and inasmuch as the
Panthers have not played before a
home crowd for‘ the past three weeks
and inasmuch as theNotre Dame
game is the “biggest” one of the
schedule, plans even greater than
those which attended the welcome
for the Ohio State students last fall
when they came here to see the
Panthers and the Buckeye tangle on
the local gridiron are under way for
this game.

There are no fraternities at Notre
Dame as there are at Ohio State
but this will not stop the Pitt frat
boys from making a big ‘time of it
over the week-end of the big game.
All fraternities have sent out invi-
tations to the members of their
alumni inviting the" latter and their
wives or, sweethearts to attend the
“Homecoming” welcome.

The gay andelaborate decorations
which appeared on the Pitt frater-
nity houses last. year will be seen
again this year even more brilliant,
if possible. This year, however, In-
terfraternity Council did not vote to
give the best decorated fraternity

Five University Men Among

Five applications for the Rhodes
scholarship have been sent by the
University to the state headquar-
ters at Philadelphia, announces Dr.
A. P.'Jam_es, chairman of the Rhodes
scholarship committee. Those who
have ﬁled application are Charles J.
Phillips, a grad, Robert McClui-kin,
Edward Burchard, Robert‘ McEwan,
all seniors, and Robert -Calhoon,
grad. “This is the largest group of
applications that we have ever sent
in at one time,” said Dr. Jones. Dr.
Jones is very optimistic about a
University representative winning
one of the scholarships.

New Method

A new method‘ of selecting can-
didates goes into effect this year for
the first time. A state committee
will assemble to chose the two who
are’ best qualiﬁed from the appli-
cants in their state. This year 'two
will be selected from each of the fol-
lowing states: ,West Virginia, New
York, Pennsylvania, New_ Jersey,
Delaware, and Maryland, swhich
make up one of the eight groups in
the United States. Under the old
plan, each state selected one scholar
twice every three years.

After each state has selected its
two candidates, the district commit-
tee will pick two from the twelve
applicants. Traveling expences will
not be paid by the Rhodes trustees,
who do pay expences to the district
meet.

The Rhodes scholarships may be
held for two years with a stipend
Scholarships
chosen this year will enter Oxford
in October, 1931. Any course of
study may be pursued, as no restric-
tions may be placed on the Rhodes
scholar’s choice of study. An en-
trance examination is not required
since the election is based upon the
student's former record in college.

To be eligible for the Rhodes
scholarshi , the student must be a
male i-esi ent' of the United States
between the ages of 19 and 25, and
must have completed at least two
The considerations
upon which the selections will

ability, fellowship, character and

pation in outdoor sports.

At AMA Conference

Miss Grace Ely, Art Consultant
of the Research Bureau for Retail

Management Association" on
Wednesday, October 22, at their
Consumer Marketing Conference
held under the auspices of Kauf-
mann’s Department Stores, Inc.

Discussing “What Is the Part of
the Retail Salesperson in Translat-
ing Con-sumer Demand into Style
Trends?” ' Miss Ely» criticized the
stylists resent disregard of con-
sumers’ yesires. Styles should be
created to please the consumer, she
said, rather than to interpret the
originality and individuality of the
stylist. Understanding of consum-
ers’ desires, she believes, may be at-
tained. by relying on salespeople to
interpret the results of personal
contact with customers.

To Address Students"

 

 

 

The mainspeaker in the Pep as-
sembly to be held this afternoon at
12:30 in Memorial Hall will be Dr.
J: Hube'C. Wagner, the greatest end
who ever played on a Pitt team. Dr.
Wagner, who is now a physician for
the Carnegie Steel Co., played ‘under
the Gold and Blue colors in 1910,
1911, 1912 and 1913.

When Pitt met Notre Dame at
Forbes Field in 21911, two great ends
faced each other. One was Hube
Wagner of Pitt; the other, Knute
Rockne of Notre Dame. It was in
this game that Wagner completely
stopped Dorais of Notre Dame who
had previously run wild against all
‘opposition. The score of that game
'was 0-0.

All-Time Star

While Dr. Wagner was not men
tioned in Walter Camp’s All-Amen
ican team, he was regarded as such
by many. Rockne regarded him as
one of the best ends who ever played,;
,and James J. Long, sports writer ofi

be'the Sun-Telegraph, chose him for

the all-time Pitt eleven.
The plans to have the two great
ends meet and speak at the assem-
bly this afternoon will be half com-

by J. n. PAULUS

Looking at the Cathedral of
Learning’s massive steel and stone
structure rising in the distance, Dean
J. C. Fetterman, Eng. '96, president
of the Alumni Association, and for-
mer Dean of the College sat mus-
ing at a window of his office on the
thirteenth ﬂoor of the East End
Savings and Trust Company. With
plans‘ for tomorrow's homecoming
activities completed Dean Fetterman
seemed to see the University thirty-
four years ago, when he, as a stu-
dent, attended here.

“Now there’s a school,” he said,
pointing to the Cathedral in the dis-
tance, “there's a school. It was over
on Perrysville avenue back in
ninety-two. The Western University
of Pennsylvania, and what a Uni-
versity. We had only the college and
the school of Engineering. The en-
tire student body consisted of one
hundred. of the ﬁnest fellows you
ever wanted to meet. Wasn't so. big,
to be sure. Notin numbers anyhow,
but we had two, debating societies,
club you'd ever want to hear. We
one was interested in something.‘
Now there was John Trees, the finest
football player that ever lived. He
gave the Trees Gymnasium {cu
know. And we had a track team 0.

gold watch." V

Married First C
“Did you have coeds then, Dr. Fet-
terman?” we asked.

“Well, it wasn't until about the
fall of lnivnet -ﬁve. Two’ sisters ap-

years later they tied for first hon-
ors. You see, I married one.” 4

And with a chuckle. Dean Fetter-
man reclined in his chair to pull’
contentedly at his fat cigar. He told
us that Dean Mccormack roplie-
sied that Pitt’s greatest gootball
rival in the future would be Car-
negie Tech. But backlii Dean Fet-
terman's time it was W. and J. A
week before _the game they tradi-
tional Pitt spirit displayed itself in
parades, bonﬁres, and pe ‘meetings.
But that’s what m e’ football
games, he said, and somehow, his
words seemed to mean’ it. .

_ Talked to Langley .

Laying his - ‘gar, now half
smoked, on the glass ashtray he
pointed to ‘a picture of a bearded,
intelligent looking man on the oppo-
site wall. “See that,” he said. “That's

head of the chemistry department.
I had a funny experience intliere
one day. You, see, I was an in‘-‘
gtructor, then, and a gentleman came
in one day wishing to see Dr. Phil-
llps who had ust stepped out. I
told him that r. Phillips was out
and he replied, “That's -too bad,

changing the subject. “Now thats
the greatest thing for that school
right now,” he answered.” “We need

plan to develo _the _Alumni Asso-
ciation. No mversltv can really
suceed without the help of such
men.”

The fat cigar had -burned to the
last inch or so by now and a cloak
of misty darkness began to envelope
the tall spire of the Cathedral oﬂ’

 

in the distance. Dean Fetterman sat

back in his chair still thinking of
thevmen who had gone on. Men who’
had come and hadwgone just as the
darkness which ‘now fall so quickly.
“Come agaimsome time," he said,
noticing our pre arations for de-

parture. “Come w en we have a lot .

Students, Faculty View Self-Government

knowledge of the subject:

Although the discussion forum on “Do Pitt Students Want Self Government, ’ held
last week, after the regular Student Council meeting, brought out a free expression of opin-
ion on the purposes of student government, the desirability of such government at Pitt, and
suggestions for a deﬁnite program of legislation, because of the small attendance at the forum
the vast majority of student body is unfamiliar with the opinions expressed.

The Pitt Weekly, therefore, presents the fo_1low_lng statements of several members of
the administration and students. It is their conscientious belief gained after a first-hand

women:

“Pitt needs a democratic govern-
ment; a government which uses in
its operation the best leadership
from the students, from the faculty
and the administration, the three
classes inevitably affected by what-
ever form of government is set up.

“Through ﬁne co-operation each
class has opportunity to release its
greatest inﬂuence in reform, in. in-
troduction of new ideas or practices.
or remoulding public opinion. Here

lies the road to the ﬁnest student
government.”

Dean Robert C. Clothier, dean of
men:

“In many institutions student self-
government is an established fact.
In any particular university it is suc-
cessful in the measure in which the
students as a whole are construc-
tively interested in the control and
direction of- their own affairs and
strengthen the hands of their elected
representatives by continuing sup-
port, free from superﬁcial criticism.
Successful student self-government
is less interested in affairs of small
moment than it is in developing a
working relationship with the ad-
ministrative authorities of the uni-
yersity and joining those authorities

ence favorably the life of the cam-
pus and classroom.

“I believe that an exceptional op-
portunity exists at Pitt for the de-
velopment of this kind of student
self government."

Omar C. Held, personnel assistant
to the dean of the College: ,

“The interest, enthusiasm, and ac-
complishment of Student Council or
any other student group is in a large
measure dependent upon the amount
of freedom they" possess to pursue
their objectives. Student groups
must be made to feel that they are
a vital part of the University and
that their advice and recommenda-
tions are valued and sought after.
Otherwise, the organization is pretty
certain to die a natural death in
spite of all attempts to inject the
breath of life into it.

“The following» suggested problems
might well be investigated by Stu-
dent Council: -

Dazzling Blonde Promises
' Pitt Back Three Ties

 

The victory of Knute Rockne’s
“Ramblers” over the Carnegie Tech
“Tart'ans” is no indication to some
Pitt students that the Panthers will
come out on the short end of the
score tomorrow. . _ .

An evidence of this is the wager
made_ by one of the Panthers’ most

blond, Mildred by name, whose resi-
dence is the Kappa House. The bar-
gain is to the effect that if Notre

ame wins, I’ he treats to dinner,
show, and dance.’ And if “Jock’s”
boys come through, madam produces
three $2.00 ties.» .

Emanuel -Fishkin. chairman of the
constitutional committee for the
proposed Men's Self Governing
Association: ‘

“The student body’s ability to as-
sume responsibility is the primary
limitation on government by the
students. However, once this respon-
sibility is established the students
should have control over their extra-
curricular affairs, and a free voice
in determining the curricular policy.”

Charles A. Seidle, chairman of Stu.-
dent Relations Committee:

“The question is not what has Stu-
dent Council done, or what can it do,
or what are its powers, but rather
what WILL it do.

“The constitution
Council says that Council shall have
. .powers. This simply
means that Student Council shall in-
itiate student movements in the ab-
sence of such initiation on the part
of the students themselves. Many
suggestions have been made along
this line, to brieﬂy summarize; work
on the part of the students to help
the Administration in drawing up a
curriculum that will meed the de-
mands of ‘all the students: interest

in vocational guidance; an increased ti

interest in the already established
and well-organized student activi-
ties; a deﬁnite movement toward a
better community.

“I am sure. that the Administra-

tion would welcome an active stu-

dent interest along these lines pro-
viding that the students participat-
ing are sincere in their efforts to

“the establishment, stabilization and
application of Democracy 31110118’
students of the University-”

Charles Edwards, president of Stu-
dent Council:

“I dislike the term Student Gov-
ernment. Our Student Council is not
a government. It is a group of stu-
dents selected by the student body
to work in conjunction with the fac-
ulty in handling certain student at‘-
fairs. This is as it should be. A uni-
versity‘ such as ‘Pitt cannot be gov-
erned by a group of students. It is
too large; it needs a group of“ ex-

, perienced men to handle such af-

fairs.

Robert Kleeb, former member of

Student Council:

“There has been in the past too
much antagonism against Student
Government. Such remarks as ‘What
does Council do? Well, for one thing,
it has dinner at Heinz House every
other Wednesday,’ are absolutely un-
called for. Councillors do not de-
serve such slamming remarks be-
cause they really are serious in their
intent. They realize they are han-
dicapped and their hands are tied in
so far as legislative procedure is
concerned.

“If these groups would be backed
by the administration and faculty,
and if the University would listen
to the representatives of the stu-
dents and co-operate with them, lis-
tening to their suggestions and help,
I believe that the University would

student body."

Carl Hermann Voss, member of Stu-
dent Relations Committee:

“If competent, student government’

is desired, the primary necessity is
a decent comprehensive system of
representation. The placing of deﬁ-
nite and responsible authorityin the
hands of Ca. few well-chosen, depend-
able representatives or even one stu-
dent executive would prove a solu-
on.

“We should not be concerned with
what material legislation 9. student
government can attempt. The real
purpose of student government
should be accomplished. This, I be-
have is an earnest effort to orient
all the students to the many phases

of‘ student life and to act as a guid-
ing inﬂuence on the campus.” '

Coed Glee Club  Members

Gather; Males Entertained

 

The women‘s group announced a:
meeting. in the Activities Building
and a few coeds’ gathered. Yeh, a

few gathered where only one could.

stand. We have seen people crush-
. in subway jams, rammed
against each other in elevators, had
their corns stepped on at rushes on

e rgain counter, even watched
soulful-eyed freshmen get swamp-
ed in the rush at the middle stair-
way at Alumni . Hal], but never

have we seen such a crowd at one‘

place, and -at one time, as this glee
club meeting. S ,

‘To start of with, we dIClti~’¢ know
what it was all about. “A meet-
ing of the Y. W. C. A.” suggested
someone.-1 “No, the Women’s Tem-
perance Union,” argued another.
Bu we had our own suspicions.
Women, and especially in such
numbers, . don't come to the Activi-
ties Building 'ust for a little meet-
ing, or even _or a social visit. The
grea‘ popularity of the glee club
seemed to us little short of incred-

ible. It's a settled fact that there H

ame_n’t that many singers at the
Umverslty. Now why did they
gather? ’1‘hat’s the question. .
Say——What Is This! l

_ There weren't any salesmen giv-
ing away cigarettes and chewing
gum like there usually,are, so that's»
out. Walter Rome was out some-
place, so that couldn’t be it. Now
what was it?

"Well, after snooping around Mrs.
Ayer’s group of future Marion Tal-
leys ‘and Madame Schumann-Heinks
we discovered that the great art of
eethoven and Mozart was not the
reason for this gathering of Pa-
trioian maidens. They had come,
because they wanted the blonde,
curly-haired football players who
are supposed to loaf up here, to
hear them sing. That's it! They
wanted an appreciative audience.
Maybe the singing gand no reﬂec-
tlons at all) mlghtnt have been
exactly just so, so so, but the au-
dience would be appreciative. But
Mrs. _Ayers fooled them. They did
not sing. ’ ,

So we come to the conclusion that,

‘pollen the ‘Student Council next call-is
g.-.9p.ei_i‘forum, set. the place at the

tlvitles Building at dinner time,
and watch the Portias run! Or say
the Heinz House, and all the future
Darrows and Bryans of the campus
will drop their checkers to attend!‘

lclinio Almost

Finished N ow

Work on Exterior to Be Com-
pleted in Ten Days

The white building which has
gradually been assuming shape; on
Fifth avenue, or in other words, the
Falk Clinic, is now nearly complet-
ed. Students are already accepting
the clinic as a Pitt institution, al-
though it will not be_until March 1

part of the University.

The exterior of the clinic is al-
most ﬁnished. In ten days_the, roof
will be tiled and covered with sheet
metal. The wall is receiving its
ﬁnal touches. The limestone walls
are being washed and the joints be-
tween the blocks ‘ ﬁlled in. The
laborers now working from a swing
bridge are getting ready to say,
“-The job's done!” .

The granite. steps on the outside
have been attached. The interior
steps, made of steel, will be inlaid
with either terrazzo or.marble._ The
concrete ﬂoors of the building will be
overlayed with the same material.
Another week will see the elevators
in working order. The boilers have
already been set, but. are not con-
nected as yet. One unique feature of
the clinic is the welding of all the
heating pipes. . _ _

The plumbing is_ progressing with
the rest of the building. All of the
plumbing, as well as the heating
pipes, is being insulated with asbes-
tos. The setting on of the doors has
been stressed in the last. week and
the partitioning of the third ﬂoor is
almost ﬁnished. _ _

Wires hanging from the celhngs
are to be used to suspend a second

the pipes. _

The setting of the window panes
has begun. Every frame: is 9611119995

It would seem that any earnest attempt to ascertain
whether or not Pitt students want self-government must ﬁrst
answer this question. The method by which council performs
its undertakings is not so fundamental as the necessity of de-

. termining what those projects shall be. Once a comprehensive,

deﬁnite program is devised the method by which it may be per-
formed will follow.

Arguments that the foundations of undergraduate sell.’-
government are in constant danger of being washed away by
‘a tide of student indifference are also apparently unduly trou-
bling those seeking to ﬁnd a place for student government. Is

' it not again safe philosophy to assume that with ‘the proper

leadership by members of the governing group, this indiffer-
ence will be transformed into a responsive attitude?

Theorists say that the stimulation in interest toward the
institution and the harmony between faculty and undergradu-
ates which results from student participation in campus affairs
are important factors in the successful working of a large edu-
cational center. They hold that the purpose of undergraduate
political and judicial activity are consistent with the conception
,o£,..»_progressive and intelligent collegiate education. This being

- so, the solution to the problem lies in the improvement, rather

than the abolition of student government.

But to elfect this improvement it becomes nwessary to set
forth‘ the purposes for which a student governing body exists.
That is the task which the present Pitt council has evidently
accepted voluntarily.

What can a student council do? Varied and important are the projects
which undergraduates may sponsor ‘in their university activities. Five
years ago, Miss Thyrsa Amos, dean of women, made a study of the com-
stitutions of governing groups in more than ﬁfty large American univer-
sities. Of the ﬁfty associations, one-ﬁfth simply expressed their purpose
to be that of self government or of an agency to enact and enforce laws

- for the conduct of students. But happily not all did this. A few wished

toigive community training; some aimed to co-ordinate student activities;
dght speciﬁcally said, “to co-operatewith. the faculty,” at very large num-
ber wished to encourage high standards of scholarship and social life;
more than one-ﬁfth spoke deﬁnitely of developing unity and a sense of
responsibility among the students.

One particularly fortunate circumstance about the present quandary
in which the Pitt council ﬁnds itself in attempting to draw up a deﬁmte
program of work, is the fact that members of council are sympathetic
toward the attempt to discover the place for such an organization on the
Pitt campus. ,

There is little use in talking of how can a thing be done or how can
interest be amused until it is deﬁnitely settled what is to be done. That is
the problem the present council and students concerned with self-govern-
meat should determine.‘ '

WHAT CAN A STUDENT COUNCIL DO?

Associallons .
llerll Slmlenl Supporl . . . .

Although both the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. are
on the Pitt campus primarily for the purpose of providing an
avenue of expression for the spiritual side of the student’s life.
they also perform many tangible services which would be lack-
ingto the University without these organizations.

The Y. M. C. A. issues each year more than a thousand
handbooks for Pitt freshmen; a -number of interesting assem-
blies and forums are sponsored throughout the year; it is the
“Y” that provides student leaders for the various Piftsburgh
settlement houses; again it is the “Y” that is ever ready to
give aid to any student, whether he be troubled ﬁnancially or
with the diﬁiculty of making an important decision.

The Y. W. C. A. holds a position of great respect and ad-
miration among women students of Pitt. It, too, sponsors dis-
cussion meetings, holds special classes, and offers aid to stu-
dents.

Because of these very practical services of the two campus
organizations coupled with their power of creating among Uni-
versity students a desire for a life that isn’t found in the
abundance of things, one will be wise to assist the groups in
their campaign for necessary funds next week.

 

Pill Again
Welcomes rad: . . . .

The third annual homecoming day for Pitt alumni opens

tonight with a smoker in the University Club. Tomorrow there

will be luncheons, meetings of old classmates and then all will
go to the Stadium ready to cheer Pitt to a victory over the foot-
ball machine of Notre Dame University.

Although the program and enthusiasm are notas elaborate
as was the case at the Ohio State game homecoming celebration
last fall, a large crowd of alumni are expected to be on hand,
and both George I. Carson, alumni secretary, and the presi-
dents of fraternities, have co-operated in providing entertain-
ment for the returning grads.

Homecoming at Pitt can never have the signiﬁcance of a
homecoming day at many other schools for fully three-fourths
of the alumni body here live within a ﬁfteen-mile radius of the
campus. If this means that much of the frivolity that accom-
panies such affairs in many schools is lacking, little will be lost.

The important thing to get out of Homecoming Day is the
fact that the Alumni have an interest in the school that they
did not permit to die with their graduation.

Bits About

Keeping an Eye on Things-—

In a Senior English class of
twenty-one studious persons, three
wear glasses. In a History class of
twice that number, thirteen students
carry windshields.‘

#

In the Stadium, the ramps_that
csrr the crowds from the lugher
leve have solid concrete walls in-
stead of the customary dangerous
iron pipe railing.

The lampposts on the campus are
usually concrete. A few iron stand-
ards remain, however, but they are
painted a bright 

The “bell” that rings a change of
classes in Alumni Hall is really six
bells. There are two in the Hall on
each foor.

The steam that heats Alumni Hall
is no longer generated in the auto-
matically fed furnaces of that build-
ing. It is piped up the hill from a
central heating plant located in
Thaw Hall which also furnishes the
heat for State Hall. In case the
mercu gets around zero, though,
the bolers in Alumni Hall can be
used to supplement the centrslplant.
Heinz I-louse participaltes in
the warmth originating in Thaw

It is surprising how often, com-
ing into a classroom, one sees little
problems like this, 23x1-1:822, on
the blackboard.

The most original and unusual
necklace we have ever seen a coed
wear consisted of a ld chain from
which was suspen ed three tiny
bunches of green grapes with green
gold leaves. The grapes were fash-
ioned from semi-precious. stone.
(Maybe it was only glass, we can't

be sure). No, we don't know the

Last Minute News-

The new buildin of the Mellon
Institute, Fifth and Belleﬁeld, will
not be started until some time after
Christmas. There is still much work
to be done on the plans for such a
monumental structure.

Somehow, the impression got
around that the October Issue of the
Pitt Panther was to be sold at the
Pitt-Notre Dame Game. Eight pros-
pective salesmen walked into the of-
ﬁce, last Tuesda but had to be
turned awa un red as the next
Panther wil not be sold until next
week. ‘I * .

Editorial-—

The arrival of chillier airs has
practically squelched our campaign
for benches and chairs on Alumni
Hall terrace. We hereby serve warn-
ing that we intend to renew our agi-
tation for these improvements the
next time the temperature reaches
70 degrees.‘

It I 1
Game Slants-—

Only a part of Pitt’s monstrous
big "band belongs to the R. 0. T. C.
and receives the beneﬁt of. military
drill. The majority of the members
are just good musicians and get to
practice the intricate maneuvers
and marching only when the band
as a whole drills, whichis not very
often. Now you know why those
lines aren't so straight as they
might be, and why you can’t always
be sure what the band is spelling
out on the ﬁeld.

Practicin up a few new convul-
sions, the anther, oﬁicial Univer-
sity mascot, is ready to strut his
stuﬁ for Notre llamas.

A letter has been received from
an anonymous Pitt fan in New York.
He pleads for the Panther football
team not to allow its prestige to be
crushed into the sod of its own ﬁeld
by that mighty team of Notre
Dame's.

U neartluly Howls With Origin
In Alumni Hall Not Ghosts,
Only Psych Experiments

Eek--squeeeek—a.re they giving
violin lessons for beginners in
Alumni Hall?

Ouuuuuu—-someone’s suffering in

there. Open that door!
What—-it’s only a honograph rec-
ord. Everyone is flstening so at-
tentively, you’d think it was grand
opera. They're even taking notes on
those ungodly squawks.

The record stops, and the class
relaxes. “Those notes were terrible,”
pipes a brunette in the second row.
So they did know there was some-
thiiﬁ wrong with that music.

“ ake out another chart for the
next test, announces Mr. Munn, tin-
kering with the victrola. “This one
will be on tonal memory.” At last
it clicks, and we know what it's all
about. This is a class in experi-
mental psychology.

A glance at the board tells the
rest of the story. Test for Musical
Ability, we read, and underneath are
listed Sense of Pitch, Intensity,
Time, Consonance, Tonal Memory,
and rhythm.

When they make up the percen-
tiles to draw a proﬁle of their mu-
sical ability, the class gasps, for one
man has an almost perfect score.
And he ﬁnally confesses that he
plays the saxophone.

Dr. Day To Address
Oxford Club Sunday

Sunday night, October 26, at 6:45
the Rev. Albert E. Day, D.D., will
speak at the Oxford Club on the sub-
ject, “Why I am a Protestant.” This
is the address which Dr. Day deliv-
ered in Carnegie Music Hall at the
religious forum a few weeks ago.
Dr. Day is pastor of Christ Church
in East Liberty.

The Oxford Club is a distinctively
student group which meets every
Sunday evening in the social room
of the Oakland Methodist Episcopal
Church. The meeting Sunday night

 

 

 

will be open to all students.

YMCA Secretary Discusses
Purpose, Student Group

By W. W. MENDENHALL
- Y. M. C. A. Secretary

The Young Men's Christian As-
sociationis proud of its mission in
education. It conceives the Univer-
sity. as organized op ortunities for
self education and t e Association
aims to maintain opportunities for
an aspect of education not otherwise
provided for. There is a large group
of students who feel the need for a
sincere and authentic s iritual‘ in-
sight powerful and usefu enough to
give practical help to their every-
day life. (Even the ultra-sophisti-
cated students who live in constant

dread less something shatters the l

-glazed and brittle veneer of their
sophistication have a hunger for
somethin which will stand the

with a common objective ﬁnd great

in. The Y. M. C. A. is a voluntary

This means: (1) Helping the Uni-
versity create a wholesome environ-
ment in all phases of campus life so
that a student will ﬁnd the induce-
ments upward instead of downward;
(2) Awakening in each student a
sincere appreciation of the values
that in the long run cost most (that
is, what religion is about); (3) Pro-
viding the means for realizing these
ideals through meetings, conferences
and other devices for bringing stu-
dents in contact with the kind of
people who can help us; (4) Putting
our ideas into action. There are
plenty of opportunities in every-day
life for men who are sensitive to
things that hurt our common life-—
prejudices of all kinds, war, poverty,
injustice, crime and graft. But we
cannot approach these social situa-

Plan Offices 
In Cathedral

Winifred McKnight to List
A Each Activity’s Needs

This year the Cathedral commit-
tee, of which Winifred McKnight,

Ed. ’31, is chairman, has set down
to practical work on the plans
for the women's floor in the Cathe-
dral and to make deﬁnite purchases
and decisions. Decisions will

made concerning the gifts and me-
morials which will be presented by
the various organizations on the
campus. These organizations will,
in turn, be asked about the require-
ments which they will make as to
the arrangements and furnishings
of their offices in the Cathedral.

During the past three years much
has been done along the line of plan-
ning the interior decorations, types
of furniture, and suggestions were
made concerning various phases of
this particular activity. However,
no deﬁnite plans were made.

It has been su gested that the
alumnae and members of the local
sororities should collaborate in ‘v-
ing a memorial to the Cathedra in
the form of an alumnae library of
which a more deﬁnite announce-
ment will be made later.

Brieﬂy we are a fellowship of
faculty. and students trying to create
attitudes and build a better world.

As a means to realizing the above
objectives we have the following ac-
tivities: ’

We have Freshman Clubs which
provide social, intellectual and spir-
itual development and good times.

A Freshman Handbook, edited by
Charles Seidle with Frank Kallfelz
as business manager, is a useful tool
for students.

. There are religious forums which
provide spiritual resources for daily
wing.

The Free Literature committee is
gathering up the best material
available for students in pamphlet
form and providing forits free "dis-
tribution among all students.

A World Education Institute to be
held by the “Y” will bring noted
speakers on world problems to the
cam_ us. It will be similar to the
Wor d Education Institute held last
year. Franklin Yellig, ’32, is co-
operating with the Y. W. C. A. and
several aculty members in making

the second annual conference even

more signiﬁcant than the ﬁrst.
Will Guide Boys

William Forrester, ’32, is helping
get a number of University students
to guide groups of underprivileged
boys in settlement houses and other
institutes.

A Interracial Committee under the
leadership of Alonzo Brewer, '33, is
gathering together a number of men
interested in helping the "races un-
derstand each other and to discuss
the barriers to friendship.

Dr. King has accepted the chair-
manship of a committee of faculty
men who are planning the develop-
ment of a series of Faculty Forums.

Membership Basis

We welcome into our membership
men of all races and creeds who care
to unite with us in spirit or purpose
and willing to invest time or money
in the program.

-ment.

Margaret Hall, Ed. ’31, the pres-
ident of W. S. G. A., has suggested
that the Cathedral committee work
with the presidents of the various
women’s organizations and come to
deﬁnite and exact conclusions con-
cernin their requirements in the
Cathe ral.

All of the work of the Cathedral
committee on the floor of women's
activities will be approved by Dean
Thyrsa Amos, Miss Helen P. Rush
and Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell.
All plans will be submitted to archi-
tects and decorators.

An Intrascholastic hockey tourna-
ment began this week; every girl
who signed up for this sport has
been placed on a team. Games will

be played on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days at 3:30 o'clock.

The teams are classiﬁed accord-
ing to colors; the captains are:
Alice Eibeck, Ed. ’32, Blue; Doro-
thy Rohland, Ed. '31, Red; Eliza-

Last Year's Issues Honored
By National Board

 

Arrival of a certiﬁcate of All-
American honor rating for the is-
sues of the Pitt Panther published
during the last school year is an-
nounced by William Everett, Col. ’31,
chairman. The certiﬁcates of rating
are issued by the National Scholas-
tic Press Association ofwhich the
Panther is a member; and the All-
American rating is the highest
given.

It signiﬁes a magazine of excel-
lent quality in makeup, editorial
material, and art work, and was re-
ceived by the Panther in-competition
with humor magazines from all over
the country. Arthur Symons, Col.
'30, was editor of the Panther last
year.

A change in‘ the business staﬂ’ of
the Panther is. announced also.
Charles Hugus, Col. '33, has suc-
ceeded ‘Carl Voss‘, Col. ’32, as ad-
vertising manger. Voss resigned be-
cause of excess points.

Contributions from the staff and
from contributors for the Fraternity
Number of the Panther are arriving
in a volume that assures an "extra
ﬁne issue. The closing date for ma-
terial for this issue is November 1.

Point Scale System
Hits Pitt Players

The point scale system has dealt
another blow to several prominent
students on campus. Robert Kleeb,
and Virginia Wickersham, president
and vice president of Pitt Players,
made ublic their resignations from
the o ces of the organization at 9
mass meeting of Pitt Players last
Friday afternoon.

The new officers selected to head
the Dramatic Club for the coming
year are John Har ster, Ed. '31,
president; Josette lrich, Ed. ’32
vice president; Dana Burdette, Eng.
’31, treasurer. Harpster was for-
mer treasurer and his election to the
presidency necessitated the election
of a new guardian of the purse
strings.

We are just a little bit late tonight; the big night for the

Sophomores, and the music has

already begun, the grand march

has started. too, winding slowly across the dark shining ﬂoor
of the Georgian Room. We have to stretch to see to the head
of the line, past the heads of-the committee, sleekly formal, to-

night, to the chairman, Jack McFarland.

smiles and steps lively, almost

as lively as little Vivian Hess, a member of the committee, a
sophomore and Jack McParland’s choice. So Jack, in black and

white, and Vivian in pale yellow%

satin start the evening of another
Soph Hop, and everybody dances.

Some Music!

The music is just right. Not too
loud, not too soft, not too sad and
not gay, just enough of eve hing
right. The right orchestra. very-
body seems to he here, listening and
dancing and talking and laughing.

There is Wilfred Berman, -he is
on the committee, you know, with

comely Isabelle Wechsler on his_

arm. Maybe she is counting the
pieces in the orchestra just as we did
a few seconds ago. Eleven pieces
and what a nice sound they make
together. There is Robert Kleeb
and Sally Rodgers and he is just
helping himself to some more dances
maybe. Anyway he is W1'ltln'8‘

erybody is here. Everybody and
his friend and that's what is so
nice. We just know everybody, just
keep saying hello.

Dance Diﬂerent

You know there are dances and
dances, and every dance is always a
little different, a little more unusu-

al than the last dance. Well, this
dance is different, too, use it
isn't different. And this is why. It
has gone back a few paces to a
lack of the unusual and has gone in
for simplicity. That makes it dif-
ferent. The lights are dimmed, of
course, but not startling in any
lighting effects. There are ferns,
green and subdued, not gilaringly
natural. It all is natural and sub-
dued. Just a lovely night, so far.
The hours are passin so quick-
ly: It seems only an nstant a
t at we inst dashed in through is e
crowded obby. The lobby has been
crowded since with the dancers,
resting between dances, for a ciga-

body has been having so much fun
that is almost time to leave-—al-
most 1 o'clock when the dance will
be over. And so the music goes
on for a little while longer, and ev-
erybody is trying to squeeze in a

w more minutes, but now Dr. and

Van Sickle and Mr. and Mrs. C.
Re ' ald Wilson are getting ready
to -' eave. They are the chapcrones
for tonight. So there is a rush for
wraps, last minute Igood-byes, lights
out, Home Sweet ome, and. an-
other dance is over, another eve-
ning hag ended perfectly and ev-
erybody is happy. And so we, too,
say goodnight and pleasant dreams.

Imposing List

——-——--—

When the Panthers and the Ram-

morrow afternoon, fans will have a
chance to see six potential All-
Americans in action on the same
gridiron. ‘

These six men are Captain Tom
Conley, Frank Carideo, Marchmount
Schwartz, and Joe Savoldi of Notre
Dame and Ca tain Eddie Baker and
Franklin Ho of the Panthers.
Two of the Pitt men and two of
the Notre Dame men will be ﬁghting
for the same position on the mythi-
cal teams. Captain Eddie Baker of
Pitt and Frank Carideo of Notre
Dame are candidates for the quar-
terback berth while Franklin Hood,
burly Panther fullback, and Joe
Savoldi, heart of the Notre Dame
ggtack, are rivals for the plunging

rth. ~

_ Carideo Unanimous Choice

Carideo already has an advantage
over the Pitt captain in the ﬁght for
the All-American quarterback berth
in that he was almost a unanimous
choice for that position on the All-
Americans teams picked last year.

” Wood of , ard and
“Albie” Booth, Yale's mighty atom.
Both boys are back in togs this year
and are giving both Baker and Ca-
rideo a ﬁght for leading honors.
Carideo received his early train-
ing at Dean Academy, Mt. Vernon,
N. Y. After his graduation, he de-
cided to cast his lot with the. Irish.
He served as an understudy to Jim
Bray during his sophomore year but
saw 'a. great deal of action because
of his ability to place-kick the ball
between the uprights. 0' 0
Last year, Carideo won his spurs
as a regular and did his work so
well that he was chosen on all the
All-American teams. -
Baker's career as a football play-
er has not been as brilliant as that
of his Notre Dame rival. Baker only
pla ed one year in high school, his

as etball reputation _ superceding
his footbali reputation when he en-
tered Pitt. I

All-Around Star
He proved his gall-around worth in

the regular quarterback on Skip
Gougler’s, y e a r ling aggregation.
When he entered the varsity ranks,
Jock Sutherland’ tried to shift him
to the center berth to take the place
of Andy Cutler who had graduated
along with “Gibby” Welch,,“Whitey"
Hagan, “Dick” Booth, “Bill” Kern,
“Chet” Wasmuth, “Andy” Salata,
“Johnny”. Roberts, “Dick” Goldberg,
Paul Fisher, and Felix Demoise from
the eastern championship team of
the preceding year. -

. Baker was forced to leave the Pitt
training camp after one week of
work‘ due to serious illness in his
family and Ray Montgomery was as-
si ed to the center ‘birth.
en~ Baker returned to the Pitt
squad, he was placed at his favorite
berth, quarterback, but he was
forced to serve as understudy to
Charley Edwards, who was the regu-
lar quarterback during the preced-
ing season. ,Last year, however,
‘Baker beat out Edwards for the
regular signal calling job and he
‘performed brilliantly even though
he received little notice as an All-
American (possibility, probably be-
cause ~ he 'd little else than call

signals.

‘ Triple-Threat Man
During the present season, how-
ever, Baker has developed into a
triple-threat man and he has been
doing his shareiof the running, pass-
ing, and kicking for Sutherland’s

oys. —
If Baker outplays Carideo, he will
have _a great chance for the All-
American berth. Carideo’s‘ best stock
in trade last year was the fact that
he had the national championship
team to work with, but with the
leading football critics of the land
on hand tomorrow, Baker can win
many followers by outplaying the
Irish star.
At the fullback posts, Franklin
Hood and Joe Savoldi will display
their prowess.
Savoldi came to Notre Dame from
thy _small Itown of Three Oaks,
Michigan, where he received but a
slight knowledge of the football
fundamentals. He played but two
minutes during his sophomore year
but he performed brilliantly last
year as a member of the “shock
WOODS-”_ He has been playing regu-
larly this year and has starred in
every game played to date. His 98
yard run for a touchdown against
Southern Methodist is the longest
run of the present season.
Hood Famed Passer

Hood came to Pitt from Bellefonte
Academy in 1927 with a reputation
as the; greatest forward passer in
the country. He had a great year
9n_ the freshman team that year but
Injuries which he received in fall
training the next year kept him
from going at full speed for the past
two years.‘ This year, however, he
has been going at a great clip and
has been leading the Panthers in the
matter of points scored in the games
date. ,
Hood was injured again in the
Syracuse game last Saturday but
he has shown enough im rovement
in the workouts held t is week
to warrant his seeing action in the
stadium game tomorrow.

In case, however, the big Monaca
boy cannot play, Jimmy Clark, who
served as-understudy to All-Ameri-
can “Pug”, Parkinson last year and

Two Teams Play Scoreless
Tie Before 6,000 Fans

 

 

With six thousand fans looking
on, the Pitt and Carnegie Tech
scoreless tie at the Pitt S ium last
Saturday. There were frequent

breaks.

ther Cubs made a desperate drive
for a- score in the last quarter, start-
ing from their own twenty yard line
and taking the pigskin to the little
Tartans’ seven yard line. Pitt tried
the line twice at this point butdid
not gain an inch. Desperately, they
threw two forward ses in suc-
cession but to no avai .
Complete Long Pass

As soon as the game started,
“Jimmy” Simms made a dash

gained forty-ﬁve yards and put the
ball inside of the Tech ten yard line.
Here the Pitt line was guilty. of
holding and they were penalized ﬁf-
teen yards, thus passing up their
is opportunity to score.

With but _a few minutes of play
left in the second quarter,’ the Car-
negie Tech Plebes opened up with a
dazzling assing attack that put the
ball on t e ﬁve yard line, but the
half ended before another play could
be completed.

Tesser and Hogan with their won-
derful punting in the third. quarter
kept both teams from threatenin
each other’s goal line. Hogan pulle
one kick that was good for seventy

back to the Pitt 30-yard line.
. Matesic Star
Pitt started their drive for the
goal in the last period with Matesic
bearing‘ the brunt of the ball carry-.
ing. Matesic was hurt after a long
gain but Vitelli who replaced him
kept up the good work until the
seven yard line was reached,» where
the Tartans heldfour downs.
Standing out in the Panther line-
up were Matesic, Vitelli, and Sebas-
tian in the backﬁeld and Skladane
and Love in the line. For the Tec

vertisement for the University provided rowdyism is absent; and all
students will be privileged to participate. '

Arguments for the bon. fire assembly are that it would be less
rowdy than a parade; and more real spirit could be shown.

Practically the entire student
body’ from the South Bend school is
expected here for the game. Everg
year, the students from the Ins
school select a game to which they
make their annual pilgrimage. Thesc
Pilgrimages are usual y "made to
Chicago, but last spring, just before
the c ose of the 1929-1930 school
year, the students voted to make
their annual pilgrimage to Pitts-
burgh for tomorrow's game. .
‘All of the seventy odd thousand
tickets_ which were placed on sale
were disposed of on Monday, accord-

erected when the demand for ducats
became great as the time for th
game drew near. "

Pitt Losses Heavy

Pitt’s losses have been just as

greatas those of the Rockne clan,

" as the Panthers lost ten men, ﬁve

of whom were All-Americans with
four others being lettermen and the
remaining player being a. valuable
backﬁeld substitute.

The All-Americans include Joe
Donchess, a unanimous choice for
an end berth; Ray Montgomery, re-
garded by Grantland Rice as even
better than Jack Cannon; “Pug”
Parkinson, who was selected on ﬁve
of the eleven outstanding All-
American teams; Toby Uansa.
hard running, pivoting halfback,
and Captain Luby DiMeolo, one of
the smallest and yet one of the
best guards of the year.

« The other men to graduate Were
Jimmy Rooney, the best punter on
the squad; Charley Edwards, regu-
lar quarterback in 1927 and 1928;
Mai-kley B-arnes, husky center; Red
Carson, a reliable tackle, and Jack
Wilps, a heady back. _

: «Despite these losses which would

teams in the country, both the Pan-

the line and 182 pounds in the back-

ﬁeld according to the ﬁgures in the
program which means that the real
weight avers. e of the Irishmen
.Will be over 1 0 pounds. '

The Pitt line, on paper, averages

‘ 183 pounds per man and the back-

‘ will avera 165 pounds, should
Clark start 9.1158174‘ pounds should

Now that all these facts are be-

‘ fore you, I am ready to make my

prediction as to the ﬁnal result.
_Thus_far, this year . my *, predic-
tions have been very close~to“the
actual ' s-come.‘
off in the West Virginia game when
"i predicted 9. 27-7 victory for Pitt,
whereas the ﬁnal score? was 1610.
I picked the Panthers itch deféat
Western Reserve 47-0. ;.-but the Pan-
thers piled up ﬁve ,,more,» 
And my last prediction was’..- r-
the Pitt-Syracuse ‘game e 7 -
Bear Stories Circulatéd 
‘Predicting these ‘scores was ?much
easier than predicting ‘the’ ‘score
for tomorrow’s game, inasmuch ._,as
the publicity departments of both
schools have been sending “bear”

stories over the ‘wires with regard ‘

to the condition of the men on the
rival squads and ; with regards to
the possible outcome of the game.‘

Pitt has reported that seven of

, ~ their men are unﬁt for duty tomor-

row" and -that the Panthers will be
1\1€kY.to hold the Ramblers to a
two‘ or three—touchdow;n margin.
_Knute Rockne has tried to foil
the work. of the Pitt publicity men
by writing articles in which he_ pro-
fesses to believe the tales that

, have gone out of Pittsburgh and in

which ‘he says that he expects his

. team to beat the Panthers by the

c

  
 
 

same margin as the Pitt public re-
’ lations men insist they will. "

-‘Your scout believes none of these
fairy tales. While it is true that
the Panthers will not enter the
game with their strongest lineup on
the ﬁeld they will be far from the
 o cripples they are reported

.Notre Dame, likewise, does not
stick to the exact facts in their
stories. They, do not expect any
more of a snap in the Panrther
tgéame than they did against the Tar.

The Irish reached their peak in
the Tech game and they will not

Irish were foroedtotaketo the air

best and had not been overconﬁdent
as to the probable outcome of the
game, it Is In belief that Rockne’s
forces would ve been lucky to
come out of the battle with a tie
score.

N otre Dame was likewise ex-
tended by Southern Methodist, a
teamwhichisnotuptoibsusual
high standard this year. Notre
Dame was forced to open up in
both of these games and the Pitt’
scouts were able to gain a fair
idea of the plan oﬂattack which
Rockne will depend upon against the
Panthers.

Pitt, on the other hand, has not
yet been extended this year. Their
opposition has been tougher than
that of Notre Dame and yet 
Panthers have clearly proven their
superiority in each contest.

, Pitt proved that it has tl1e_g‘rea.t-
est line in the country again this
year when the Pan_ther forward
wall outplayed the mighty Syracuse
linemen with a line that was not
as good as the one which Wlil take
the ﬁeld tomorrow. '

Notre Dame has not-f&ed a line
the equal of the Pitt line this year
and when they try to ‘dent the
mighty Panther wall, they will ﬁnd
themselves facing the toughest as-
signment which has ever been
forced upon them.

Notre Dame will not make more
than two or three ﬁrst downs
through the Pitt line and their for-
ward passing attack will hardly be
more effective than their running
attack. —

The Panthers have one of th
best forward passing defenses in
the country. fMost teams try the
Pitt line at ﬁrst and when they
ﬁnd that part of the machine im-
pregnable, the shift their attack
to the air. hey throw so many
passes that they are bound to com-
plete a few of them and. when they
do scomplete them, fans raise their
hands in the air in token of the
weakness of that department of the
Sutherland machine. A

When Pitt opens up tomorrow,
Rockne will learn quite a few new

The Pitt team will be atlts peak

You knew. how those_ Syracuse
boys went around bragging about
their line, and the holes they would
ogen up.‘ Well, take it from me,
t e holes opened up by their line
wasn't enough to squeeze the toes
of their backﬁeld men in, alone try-
ing to push their whole carcasses
thro But that line of ours sure
open up like the Campus Scout’s
month since he was lucky enough to
hit the right score of the game.

Warns

Well, Pm going to tell you fans
a. few things that I shouldn't ‘tell
you about the game, but I believe
my public is entitled to know every-
’ g. 80 here it is’: Before the
game I brought all of the backﬁeld
men over into 9. corner of the dress-
ing room. and told them speciﬁcally
that I‘didn’t want any of them mak-
ing any runs from the kickoﬂ for a
touchdown, as Knuto Rockne had a
couple. of scouts up in the stands.
I had a hard time getting Captain
“Eddie” Baker to. ‘ve in,.but after
I told him that i he didn’t listen
to me, I’d (never give him another
tip like I did in the Western Re-
serve game when he made that long
run of ninety-seven yards due to my
headwork, he gave in and liked it.
Well, tomorrow it's a battle of
wits, me and .“Jock" on» one side,
with Rockne and his band of two
hundred warriors on the other side,
in other words, brain and brawn
pitted against numbers. And may
the best. team win, which I think is
ours. Anyhow, you know “Jock”
has an ‘‘_ace in the hole,” because
“J ock" hasn’t used me in any ames
to date. Last week I to! you
“Jocl§" wasn’t going -to use me, and
he -;d1dn’t. Nobody has seen, me in

I To -Solve Latest Mystery
For “Lost and Found”

A “Nobody loves me and my
_hands are cold,” some little
coed will be moaning ‘one of
- these cold ‘mo:-nings.—-Well, we
can. help her out if she’s the
right girl, and we’ll tell her
here just what to do.——Now
don’t forget, though, she has to
be the right girl, and there can
be_ only three right ones.
These right ones must wear
brown gloves and must have
lost them somewhere near the

campus, for there _are’ six such
“dear little articles” (they

really do look expensive) at the
Lost and Found Department in
State Hall. By claiming the
gloves the lonesome little coed
may get the right “chap.”

 Questions Announced;
Tour Of East Planned

 

 

The ﬁnal tryouts of the Women’s
debating team were held this week,
resulting in the selection of Murie
Hockmuth, Louise Linn, Genevieve
Blatt, Minnie Meyers, Zora Unko-
vitch, Edith Hirsh, Sara Josselson.
Eleanor Korler and Gladys Pyle, all
of last year, and Gertrude Magram,
Jeraldine‘ Alter, Mary Mckmms,
Deborah Miller, Ellenrosann Peters
and Idamae Milles of the freshman
class. .

The questions which MISS Theresa
Kahn, director of woman’s debating
is considering for this season are:
“Resolved, that the ‘emergence
women from the- home into indus-

deplored” and “Resolved, that the
Eighteenth Amendment should  re-
pealed, so that control of‘ the liquor
traific may be left to the several
states.” - . .
The schedule for this year will
include. one long trip, probably cov-
ering one or_two schools in New
the way home. There will be the
and George Washington Seminary,
but whether or not they ,will be he d
at home has not yet been decided.

Spikers Lose
To Buckeyes

Clise' Leads Pitt Runners
' Across Finish Line

Coach Frank Shea’s cross-coun-
try team suffered a. 40-to-19 defeat
at the hands—-or more exactly, the
ﬂashing feet-—of Ohio State Uni-
versity’s aggregation of Red and
Grey harriers at Columbus last Sat-

‘urday.

The Buckeyes took first, third,
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth places, leav-
ing only a well-deserved second for
the Pitt men. Hanover, of Ohio
State, took first place, being clocked
at 22:48, while Pitt’s low point
scorer was John Clise.

It was the home team’s four-mile
course,,laid out on almost perfectly
level ground that boasted but few
obstacles, which proved to be the
Waterloo for the Pitt team. Coach
Shea’s men have been in training on
the uneven terrain of Schenley Park,
and the Columbus course with its
few, if any, hazards for the cross-
country man was too strange a me-
dium for their type of performance.

Frosh Promising

The freshman cross-country s uad
promises to be the best that itt
has ever had. The best time run so
far on the Schenley course by the
freshmen came within 13 seconds of
a previous record made by Gus
Moore. Watkins, Eisenhart, Law-
rence, former city and county high
school champ; Keller, Platt, May and
Kunz, all who ﬁnished in the order
named, are this year’s outstanding
cross-country men on the fresh
squad. .

Tomorrow the varsity and fresh-
men will meet the strong Penn State
team at Schenley Park in their next
scheduled meet.

dents.

Curriculum advice in co-o eration
with the dean and the hea of the

Cornell Grad First To Take
Dean Of Women’s 

 

By ELAINE FORAKER

Magnetic brown eyes and 8 guick
smile mark the personality 0 the
slim girl in whom Pitt coeds will
ﬁnd a new friend at Heinz House
this year. She is Josephine Ross
Hunter, the ﬁrst woman to take the
course at the University for deans
of college women, under the instruc-
tion of Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women.

Before her graduation from Cor-
nell last spring, Miss Hunter be-
came interested in personnel work
through the dean of women there.
She advised her to return to her
home town—-for Miss Hunter lives
in Ben Avon -- and study under
Dean Amos, who is one of the out-
standing deans in the country, and
president of the Association of
Deans of College Women.

Under the guidance of Dean
Amos, Miss Hunter will learn the
theory of the work of a dean of
women and get practical experience
In working with college women. At
the same time, she will acquire a
broad background in sociology and
psychology, v V

Miss Hunter is especially inter-
ested in extra.-curricular activities.
For this reason she will have man
contact with Pitt women. She wil
soon become established as a fa-
miliar ﬁgure in the Heinz House of-
ﬁce. Her present study is that of
women’s fraternities, including a
comparison of the situation at Pitt
with other schools. She will have
the_co-operation of Panhellenic Aa-
sociation in this study. .

From the students point of ‘view,
Miss Hunter knows already a, great
deal about extra-curricular activi.
ties. She was the womcn’s editor
of the‘ Cornellian, a member of Mor-
tar Board, Y. W C. A. cabinet,

Silverman. Returns After .
Extended European Trip

Dr. Alexander Silverman, art in-
ternational authority on glass, head
of the Department of Chemistry, has
returned from Liege, Belgium, where
he attended the congress of the In-
ternational Union of Pure and Ap-
plied Chemistry.

At the congress Dr. Silverman

spoke on the subject, “Recent De-
velopments in American Glass Man-
ufacture.” He was chosen as one of
the ﬁfteen members of the United
States delegation by the United
States National Academy of Science
and the National Research Council.
The United States committee was
headed by Charles L. Reese of Du-
ponts, Wilmington, Delaware.
The International Union meets
every two years in a different coun-
try; Madrid, Spain, has been se-
lected as themeeting-place for the
1932 convention. The congress met
at Liege this year because the Bel-
gian people are holding the centen-
nial of Belgian independence with
expositions at the more important
cities of the country. At Leige were
the technical and scientiﬁc displays.
Dr.‘ Silverman was_ particularly
fascinated by the exhibit provided
by the University of Liege. This
university was founded in 1817 and
is particularly known for the scien-
tiﬁc research carried on there. Their
display included a collection of sev-
eral manuscri ts written by some of
thte first pro essors of the univer-
si y.

The Conservatory of Music at
Liege displayed the manuscripts of
their famous pupils! and also some
of the musical instruments used by
them. Yasay, Deberriot, Radoux,
and Caesar Franc studied at the con-
servatory. _ .

From Liege Dr. Silvei-man went
to Antwerp where the government
had placed the art exposition. In
Antwerp was collected the largest
exhibition . of Flemish art that has
ever been assembled. ‘The Belgian
government borrowed from their
owners the originals of paintings by

This exposition is remarkable in that
it is a ﬁnancial success.

In Brussels where Dr. Silverman
next went, he examined the Anton
Wertz Art Museum which is unique
in that only the work of Wertz is
displayed there. Wertz confined
himself to depicting the effect of
emotions on man. He painted scenes
showing his impression of such ab-
stract conditions as hunger, starva-
tion, and knowledge.

Dr. Silvernian admitted that he
thought Brussels one of the most
beautiful cities of the Old World.
Every home had a ﬂower garden.
making the city a riot of color. The
ﬂowers of the begonias which ranged
in color from a golden yellow to
deep coral, of ‘z-in reached a diameter
of three inches. . _

In Paris, Dr. Silverman examined
the new dormitories which are be-
ing built by the different nations
which send students to the Univer-
sity of Paris. Recently John D.
Rockefeller endowed the American
section. The University City as its
translated French title means in-
cludes dining rooms, nasiums,
and recreation rooms or the stu-
dents. ' _

Dr. Silverman added to his collec-
tion of glass about seven tpieces of
French glass——the work 0 Daume,
Goupy, Lolique, Galle, and Walter.
He considers the French pieces about
the most beautiful he has ever se-
cured. He also bought several
pieces of Dutch glass.

While he was in Liege, Dr. Silv-
erman also attended the meetings of
the Tenth Congress of Industrial
Chemistry.

Dr. Silverman has taken some mo-
tion pictures of the most important
ﬁgures of the two conventions and
the most interesting points of the
exposition. These pictures are at
present being developed and will be
shown at some future time.

“Downtownei-’

The first issue of the “Downtown-
er,” official publication of the down-
town division of the University, was
distributed to the students Monday
evening, October 13. The “Down-
towner” has under one a change of
policy this year. eretofore it was
a subscription magazine, composed
of articles Vvritten by both business
men and students and intended for
both. The paper this year, unlike the
magazine, is free. It aims to be sole-
ly_ a student paper, to obtain con-
tact among the students and “to
assist in the creation of good fel-
lowship, school spirit and loyalty.”

The ?‘Downtowner” is a. four-page
four-column sheet. It will be issued
at least, ten times. this year. H.
Philip Ruprecht is the_ editor, and
Earl A. Zimber, managing ‘editor.

In this first issue, Vincent W. Lan-
fear, director of division, welcomes
the students. “You may be interest-
ed in knowing," he says, “that by
virtue of your registration, you have
helped to make this the largest year
in point of numbers that the Down-
town Division has ever had. . . .I
shall consider it a personal favor if
between or after classes you come
by the office from time to time so
that I may come to know -each one
of you better.”

includes an appropriation of nine
hundred dollars from the University.

Further business included the des-
ignation of the assembly periods of
the first and second Fridays of each
month as the time for Student Coun-
'cil meetings, and the resolution to
conduct student. assemblies during
the assembly periods of the remain-
ing two Fridays. The first of these
assemblies, on the third Friday of
each month, will be conducted by a
member of Student Council, while
the last gathering will be lanned
and conducted by the facu ty.

Student Party

tended the mixer that was held in
