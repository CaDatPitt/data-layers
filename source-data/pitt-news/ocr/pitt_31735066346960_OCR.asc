1 result of this exchange of
ideas, the journalists from
abroad will obtain a deeper in-
sight into American patterns of
life."

The day—long seminars and dis-
cussions will deal with: Char-
acteristics of the social structure.
the role of the ethenic and min-
ority groups. the dynamics of the
economy, labor as a force in
American life, the political pro-
cess, and American myths and
values.

Informal Discussions

"The discussions will be in-
formal and conducted in an atmo-
sphere of mutual goodwill in order
to achieve frank and genuine un-
derstanding." Miss Joshua ex-
plained, “An American consultant
will open each session with a brief
introductory statement about the
subject.

“Two or three other Ameri-
cans will attend each session to
assist in the development of the
exchange ideas. The same mod-
erator will preside at all ses-
sions to assure the continuity of
the whole seminar." 1

The seminars at the Uni\'ersityi
will be followed by a three week
jaunt of the United States, where
they will see speciﬁc examples of
the subjects discussed. Individuals
usually have a choice to the places
that may interest them the most.

Four Years Here

Dr. Grose
Finds Jobs

Two out of every lO0 seniors
who graduate from the
of Education and are interested
in classroom teaching do not find
jobs. ,

It’s not the fault of Dr. C. Her.
main Grose, director of the School
of Education Placement Office.
He and his staff find jobs torthe
other 98 percent. A -

Dr. Crose is well qualified to
head the placement operations‘.
lie has held almost every exist-
ing position in education -- from
clzissrooin tc:i(.-her to college pres-
ident. Students consider him ‘a

"it isn't like moving bricks;
you can't handle people‘ like

as a catalytic agent.
I bring the two elements together
and hope something will happen.”

Besides searching through from
5,000 to l0.000 requests for teach-
ers, the office handles 30 in-ser-
vice tcachcrs, 40 school adminis-
trators, I00 people in higher edu-
cation, and 12 guidance specia-
lists in a year's time.

Since he came to the Univer-
sity four years ago. Dr. Grose has
greatly refined the operations of
his various search files employed

in keeping track of the varied
: projects.
One of his present projects is

‘concerned with placing a student

who is now completing his doc-
torate in English. The student

specified a metropolitan location

in the far west or along the east-
scaboard. He wants to teach
college freshmen composition in a
intergratcd school. Dr.
Grose expects to be able to place
the young man.

NOT CONS!-ZNTING — Senator Seab Cooley. portrayed by Charles
Laughton. speaks against the appointment of Robert Leffingweil
as Secretary of State as Majority Leader Bob Munson (Walter
Pidgeon) looks on. Movie is based upon "Advise and Consent.”

‘Advise and Consent’

t O O

 Movie Follows Book

7, B)’ MATTHEVV NESVISKY

Otto Preminger has a simple formula for making money—
makers: take the number-one novel on the best seller list,
shuffle the pages. smooth over the “dirty parts" and throw
it onto the biggest screen available.

One of his more recent

block-busters was the rather

talky turkey, Exodus. His latest film is the loudly tub-thump-

ed Advise and Consent, now play-O

ing at the Fulton Theatre, Down-
town.

The motion picture is based on
Allen Drury’s Pulitzer Prize-win-
ner, loosely in some parts, more
exactly in others. Wendell Mayes's

V screenplay. however, does follow

fairly accurately the intriguing

plot of the novel.

Submits Name

The President of the United
States (I-‘ranchot Tone) submits
the name of Robert Leffingwell
(Henry Fonda) to the Senate for
its approval as the replacement for
the recently-deceased Secretary of
State. A Senatorial sally begins,
however, when South Carolinian
Seabright Cooley (Charles Laugh-
ton) vows to block the appoint-
ment because of an old personal
grudge.

Seab Cooley throws more
weight around the Senate than
even suggested by Laughton’s
lovable, lethargic carcass. A sub-
committee holds. a hearing, pre-
sided over by Senator Brigham
Anderson (Don Murray). Left-
ingwell is accused of being pro-
Communist (he's an ex-profes-
sor at the University of Chicago.
no less )and the whole nation
is electrified.

Now the plot sickens. As Ander-
son, head of the investigating
committee, decides to disregard
party loyalties and seek only the
truth about Lefty Leffingwell, a
pushy Junior Senator named
Freddie Van Ackerman (George
Gizzard) plans to secure the Presi-
dent’s choice at all costs.

Aekerman obtains proof that An-
derson had been a naughty,
naughty boy during World War II.
He dangles a photograph and a
love letter. Anderson's mistake
s using the male) over the sub-

 

‘committee chairman's head. Help-
less, Anderson slices it off.

Majority Leader Bob Munson
(Walter Pidgeon) finally calls
for Advice and Consent. but the
Senate roll call vote is inter-
rupted when the President has a
fatal, (but convenient for the
plot) coronary. The Vice-Presi-
dent (Lew Ayres) immediately
takes command and ironically
states that he chooses to name
his own Secretary of State-—his
brother-in-law. for all we know.

The story, while somewhat in-
credible and shocking, comes of!
as fascinating as its setting, the
Nation‘s Capital. But it is the
acting of several members of the
cast which really make Advise
and Consent worth seeing.

Charles Laughton is bigger and
better than ever, equalling his per-
formances in Witness for the Pros-
ecution, llobson’s Choice. even The
Hunchback of Notre Dame. As
Seab Cooley, he shuffles, wheezes,
jiggles, blinks, slobbers, blinks to
perfection.

Smaller roles are ﬁlled with big
talent, too. Henry Fonda, Peter
Lawford, Paul Ford, Lew Ayres
and especially the personable Wal-
ter Pidgeon turn in their usually
commendable efforts. And if you
like to hate somebody, George
Grizzard, playing Freddie Van
Ackerman, will successfully draw
your wrath.

$75,000 Grant

Goes to Dentists
The University's School of Den-

grant from the National Institute
of Health. The money will be
used to study tissue reaction to
materials used in implant den-

 

tistry and maxillo-facial surgery.

By Vijay Jain

“The number of students going
to Europe during summer is in-
creasing substantially every year,
the Ofiiice of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange gives several
scholarships and study abroad
grants every year, but many
others travel and study in Europe
during the hot summer months on
their own resources." said Mrs. El-
Wazir.

“We render advice and aid to
not only the students who win the
scholarships but also to any in-
terested student who makes the
effort to come up to our oﬁiice
and solicit it. Very few seem to
know that we can help the stu-
dents to make up their itinerary
and give them helpful tips and
advice on varied topics.

“Students other than those re-
ceiving scholarships have to ap-
ply to the college or university of
their choice and obtain the admis-
sion, but this is usually quite easy
for the summer sessions and
merely a formality in most cases.
We are however, pleased to advise
the student in making a decision
about the right institution if we
know their preference of location
of the college and types of coruses
they would like to take there."
Mrs. Wazir explained.

Scans Catalogues

The first step towards foreign
study is to scan through the cata-
logues of the European universi-
ties for the courses. Most of the
catalogues are available for per-
usal at the OCEE office with Mrs.
Wazir. In certain cases it is nec-
essary to write to the university in
question and ask for it.

“Experience has shown that
admission to the Universities in
Great Britain, Scotland and
Oslo are comparatively difficult
due to lack of adequate facili-

To Collection
T. S. Eliot Writing

Included in Set

Eighty-three letters have been
added to the Darlington Library
collection of original manuscripts.
Some are handwritten while
others are typed and signed.

One of the letters is by T. S.
Eliot, commenting on modern
poetry, and in another Allen Tate
discusses the role of criticism.
Two poems among the papers are
“The Silken Tent" by Robert
Frost (typed and signed) and
“Canto” by Juan Ramon Jimenez,
winner of the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 1956 (in Spanish,
typed, signed in pencil, and
dated 1938).

The importance of the papers
lies in the autographs, the two

“Previously we even made hotel,

with many more going we‘
have curtailed this service." Mrs.
Wazir continued, “travel folders,
and lists bf inexpensive hotcl.<‘are
still very helpful."

“Cheapest means of transport
is by freighter but the infreq-

indefinite nature make this
mode of transport unfeasible.

“The council on student travel

“An international student ident-

Double Anniversary

1787 was a banner year for both the United States of
America and the University of Pittsburgh. In that year the
delegates to the Constitutional Convention hammered out
a concept of government durable and flexible enough to
_make America a world leader within five generations;
founders of the Pittsburgh Academy forged an educational

stitution of tomorrow.
It is ﬁtting that next fall’s celebration should commem-
, otiate both events, for education and democracy have proven
a to be complimentary bedfellows. Symposia on Constitution-
al development presented with Fall Convocation and ad-
vances in the University’s building programshould remind
‘participants of the role the growth of education has played
in the growth of democracy.
But one ingredient is missing or still only vaguely in-
dicated in anniversary planning: the ability to relax and
enjoy themselves which Americans have used to temper the
sometimes rigorous demands of an always-growing nation.
cEven during war Americans have considered it necessary to
occasionally loosen their collars, stretch their legs and
smile. By not striving too hard for international success,
While members of the committee entrusted with plan-
ning details of the anniversary celebration wish to main-
‘tain a scholarly atmosphere throughout the festivities, they
are aware that not all of America’s greatness lies in the
” -"classroom or governmental chamber. They are also aware,
however, that our talent for ingenious relaxation has not
come from the state but from the people——we do not have
recess because someone blows a whistle but because we
feel we can take a break and still reach our ends.
The ‘people’ to whom the planning committee would
prefer to leave relaxation preparations are the student
body. Chancellor Litchﬁeld indicated this recently at a
luncheon with student leaders and suggested that Tom
Olofson, SG President, would be the logical choice to co-
ordinate student—originated events for the anniversary cele-
lg bration. Olofson is a member of the anniversary committee,
has already suggested a student-sponsored dance and wishes
to hear other suggestions from students and student groups.
Participation of all of the University community can
i make next fall’s an event which will commemorate the
emany facets which have made education a driving force
within democracy.

East of the Curtain

   

  

Today's stop on the cheapskate’s tour of Europe
is one of the largest and most important countries
in all the world, Russia; or, as it is also called, the
Soviet Union; or, as it is also called, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics; or, as
it is also called, Slavesville.

That the U.S.S.R. is actually
in Europe is a matter of conjec-
ture; some hold that it is mainly
in Asia, and should not properly
be called a European nation.
Actually, nobody wants to claim
it.

Russia, being such an im-
mense land, offers a wide variety
of climate and terrain. From
one end of the country to the
other, Nature abounds in all of its forms (the Rus-
sians invented Nature). The temperature ranges
from a purple-frigid 180 degrees below zero in the

.. north to a pleasantly-temperate 175 degrees below

zero in the south. The countryside shows rollick-
ing, snow-covered hills, proud, snow-covered
mountains, lush, snow-covered valleys, torrid.
snow-covered deserts and chuckling, snow-covered
seacoasts.

Forced to Huddle .

Because of the cold, the Russian people are
forced to huddle together, for animal warmth is
the only kind of heating system which the various
Five-Year plans have been able to produce. The
people collect (a popular term in the U.S.S.R.) in
cities rich in history. Containing 287.391.632.009
residents, Volgagrad is one of the Peoplc‘s Pari-
disical villages. Volgagrad, as you assuredly are
aware, was formerly called Stalingrad, but, due to
certain political ideologies -— well, actually, Volgo-
grad was really called Petrograd before it was
changed to Stalingrad and then to -- that is, what
we now call Leningrad was originally St. Peters-
burg, which was originally located between St.
Augustine and Daytona Beach, but which is now
referred to as - oh, the hell with it. Let's get
on to Moscow.

The population of Moscow, which numbers
l08,738,634,990,004, is a crowded —— but at least
warm -— conglomeration. Although Moscow is the
capital of Russia, the residents merely call them-
selves Muscovites, never capitalists.

State of the State

The present state of the State came about after
a bloody revolution back near the turn of the cen-
tury. Prior to the Bolsheviks, the Russian people
lived as serfs. or peasants. They were ruled by the
Czar and Czardine, and were not given the right
to vote, own much, or advance themselves. The
Bolshies bumped off the Czar‘s family. except for
Anastasia, who later turned out to be Ingrid Berg-
man, which didn't bother anybody. They then pro-
ceeded to construct a Communistic government.

The result of this was that the peasants were
no longer peasants; they were now prolctariatl.
They could now vote (they're given one party, to
avoid confusion). They no longer have to worry
about owning property; it now belongs to nobody. I
And they don't have to worry about advancing
themselves; the government tells them where they
can go.

Remnants of an Age Gone By
i— The Misﬁt Minority _J
i I By Joseph Greif

You say your parents threaten to pull you out
of school if you don't come up with a 4.0 this term!
And you can’t seem to stay awake in class! And
your teachers laugh when you ask a question! And
you can't seem to stay stay '
awake out of class! And you ’ 4 ‘ '
have four midterms tomorrow!
Don’t blame yourself for all your
problems! Blame the H-bomb
tests. Blame the stars. And
whatever you do, don’t leave
your teachers without a scar.

There are still some so-called
teachers at the University who
are as obsolete for our current
program as are the 1952 entrance
requirements. Ten years ago
they might have been satisfactory. Today these
teachers should be put out to pasture. .

Uninformed they are not. They know more than
enough for their courses. The trouble is that they
content themselves with the off-the-cuff approach.
They are guilty of a crime usually attributed to
students: regurgitating absorbed knowledge with
no attempt at clearly explaining and relating the
facts in their proper perspective.

They know approximately what they are sup-
posed to say in class and they say it. Did the stu-
dents get the point? No??? That‘s a shame. Some-
times, these"‘teachers” even show amusement at
a student‘s failure to_ grasp what to them is funda-
mental.

A teacher who is in school mainly because he
has nothing better to do should be given, as are

people in other endeavors who no longer further ‘

the organization’s aims, an unconditional release.
If he doesn't like teaching, he should not be turned
loose on the students.

Extra-Curricular Activities

Then again, his teaching shortcomings could
come, not from having nothing better to do, but
from having something better to do. He may be
writing a book (or making book), or investigating
’ i th subject of

he should be given an unconditional release.
As an omen of things to come, Dr. Harold
Taylor, former president of Sarah Lawrence Col-

lege, composed this little tale. ,4

p"There once was a professor," writes Dr. Tay-
lor, “who was so important and so mixed up with
helping run the country . . . that he couldn‘t give
a weekly seminar for twelve students, his only
‘¢3¢MlI:' responsibility. He went to the dean and
said, ‘Dean, I'm afraid I can’t make it—I‘ve got
to run the world and all these things. I will tape
what I have to say to the seminar, and the tapes
can be played each week at the appropriate time.’

‘‘The clean agreed. Some four weeks later, the
professor found, himself inadvertently on ‘his own
campus. He thought it only decent to go along
and see how the class was making out. He went
to the appropriate room at the appropriate time
and opened the door. There, an the front desk,
was the tape recorder transmitting his voice. There,

on twelve chairs grouped around the room, were 

twelve other tape recorders.”

An excellent way to dampen or destroy a stu-
dent’s desire to learn is to provide him with teach-
ers who show no desire to teach. And is it not a
purpose of the University to bolster and encourage
this desire to learn? ‘A person who is too enrapo
lured by his own knowledge to exert a conscious
and constant effort towards helping others to
understand the conplexitiesi of thevsubject is not a
teacher. He is masquerading. He's a phony.

Students——and especially students‘ who are pay-
ing dearly to attend a university of a “high academ-
ic character”-——should not be submitted to these
misplaced geniuses to be played with.

An awareness of obsolete parts in a system is
the first Step towards their replacement. In the
tangled web of administrative oﬁices, one cannot be

certain who would be designated to handle this 

Problem. But join me in prayer, fellow sufferers,
that whoever he may be-—-high up there in the
tallest of all school buildings--he will hear this

FLABBERGASTED

Dots and dashes of a weary writer who thanks an un-
known duffer named Dominic Zaccagnini for the following
observation on driving a golf ball: “Never look up when you
drive; you’ll never see a good shot.”

An Eastern athletic director silenced a faculty critic who
wanted basketball abolished from the college program be-
cause of the fix scandals. “If you catch a kid cheating in one
of your classes,” he asked, “do you drop the course?"

Wasn't the publicity surrounding the Jerry Lucas-turn-
ing pro bit nauseating? Lucas did so much
soul-searching about tainting his morals by
accepting pay to play basketball. If he was
so scrupulous why did he reveal his move in
a signed article in Sports Illustrated for some
additional hay?

Carver Chosen

Pitt Athletic Director Frank Carver has
been named president of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Wrestling Association. He will
finish the term of Percy Sadler, former Le-
high athletic director who has retired.
Carver will serve until this December.

Ace halfback Paul Martha’s brother Rich is going to
attent West Virginia University. If he wasn’t going to go. to
Pitt did he have to go there‘? He originally said he was going
to Kentucky and the two schools are in a hectic squabble
about the decision. ‘

It is reported that basketball recruiting isn’t going
good for Coach Bom Timons. Jack Marin of Farrell went
to Duke; Dave Brown of Edgewood is going to Lafayette:
Stew Johnson of Clairton is headed for Wichita. .

Recruiting is getting as silly as the bonus baby hunt in
major league baseball. High school athletes are holding out
nowadays for five and eight year graduate school scholar-
shi s.

pMany of the Pitt recruits and present letter-holders were
seen working at menial jobs at the United States Open Golf
tournament. Thanks to these summer jobs goes to_Beano
Cook who tries to help recruiting in every way possible.
Cope of His Best

The only penalty that Pitt’s baseball team suffered for
playing ball during the spring trimester: they had to go to
school, too.

»Myron Cope, former Pitt News sports editor, has two ex-
cellent articles in current magazine publications. He has
the special story in the vastly-improving SPORT book, and
his story on Cassius Clay, the bravado heavyweight boxer, is
a classic in TRUE magazine. _

Don Gifﬁn, who Cope succeeds as sports editor of this
paper, was in town during the U.S. open. He is the traveling
press secretary of the golf tour. Must be nice to follow the
sun.

 

The syndicated columnists were the only writers who
didn’t watch the Open Tourney. They just sat in waiting
in the press tent and watched the scoreboard and listened
to their younger compatriots.

Baseball is five minutes of action wrapped up in three
hours of listlessness. Baseball is only exciting if you read

the true-to-life diary of Cincinnati pitcher Jim Brosnam in
a book called “The Pennant Race.”

Reports have it that Coach Warren Neiger extended a
gymnastic scholarship to a Clairton boy who danced the
“twist” at half-time of the Bears’ basketball ball games. He
might turn out to be another Earl McConnell. That Eastern
star started out as a acrobatic dancer. _ _

Roger McGil1, the overworked trainer who says his job
would kill any normal man, is slated for the head 30b pretty

S0011.

Joe Brown Among Net Leaders
In Metropolitan Tennis Tourney

“There’s one thing wrong with
Joe Brown, the Panthers’ number
one tennis player,” say his op-
ponents, “he wins too much."

And Brown is at it again.
He has already picked up two

i victories in an effort to cop first

place in the West Penn Open
Tournament. The matches are
held at Carnegie Tech, which
served as home base over the past
few seasons for the Panther net-
ters.

Dave O’Laugh1in, number two
man for the Jungle Cats, and

Brown are still in the, running.

Roger Glaser, number four man
on the team the past season, was
edged out in first round com-
petition by scores of 7-5 and 10-8.

Jack Waltz, who recently came
out tops in the Metropolitan
Open, is seeded number one in
the tournament, and Brown num-
ber two. Brown was the winner
of the Edgewood Country Club
Tournament, and he and
O‘Laughlin, according‘ to their
records at the college nets, should
give their opponents some stiff
competition.

The matches will be held up to
and including this Saturday.

H as Russian Solution

Beano Cook Reviews Action

At U. 5. Open Golf Tourney .

By BEANO COOK
After spending a week at the National Open, it’s now
obvious why the golf beat is the best in the business. Golf
writers live like millionaires without their problems.
The combination of Oscar Fraley, Bob Drum, Bert Mc-

Grane, and Morry Siegel under the same tent is more than
the average fan could bear. President Kennedy should send
this quartet to Russia to negotiate.

for disarmament. Mr. “K” then
could see that the capitalistic sys-
tem does have its problems.

As usual, the television group
was represented. Many times
these guys from New York are

bores and are impressed with
themselves. However, not this
group.

If I ever have a boy and he
wants to be a baseball writer, I
will kill him. Here’s the world's
most boring game. Let him cover
golf, a refreshing sport although
it’s tough to write.

The food at Oakmont Country
Club was a little superior to the
hot dogs and watered-down
beverages sold at many of the
baseball parks. However, so
were some of the prices.

Still golfers are the most tem-
permental athletes in the business.
The greens are tough for every-
body, but each golfer believes
that they are faster for him.

Golf fans are the most rabid
people alive and they are as

They are pushed, shoved, kicked,

and booted. One green looked just
like Custer’s last stand with

 
 

obnoxious as the wrestling group.’

Arnold Palmer playing the part
of the last soldier.

Arnie's Army was loyal to ev-
erybody was rooting for him. The
other contestants must have felt
like Ava Gardner's former hus-
bands.

Dick Sharbaugh, public re-
lations director for Duquesne
and a helper in the press tent
during the Open commented,
“We could be at war and I
would not know it. In fact. I
forget what my living room
looks like.”

So it was during the week of the
Open. A few laughs, a few con
men, a few drinks and many silly
questions. One writer, (female)
asked me where the ladies’ room
was. After this question, I looked
at myself in the mirror.

But the biggest event was that
the Pirates were on the second
sports page one day. Impossible,
and after a seven—game winning
streak. Never thought I would see
the day when this dying sport (in-
side ﬁve years) would play sec-
ond {iddle to anything except an-
other war. Estes was in second
place to the Open. The Open,

however, outdrew Estes’ pcreditfors.
