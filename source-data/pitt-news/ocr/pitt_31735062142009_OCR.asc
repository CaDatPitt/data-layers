Theta Women
Win ln Festival
Float, Parade

With a colorful presentation of
Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,
Kappa Alpha Theta fraternity won
the Spring Festival nursery rime
ﬂoat parade Friday, succeeding
Phi Mu fraternity whose Straw-
berry Blonde ﬂoat won last year.

Depicting a. garden scene, the
ﬂoat consisted of bundles of ﬂow-
ers, a white trellis, and Jean Smull
as Mary watering a bush of roses.

Kappa Kappa Gamma fraternity
took second place with their entry
of Little Boy Blue.

Dr. John Geise, associate pro-
fessor of history, chairman of the
faculty judging committee, said,
“The judges compliment the spring
festival ﬂoat committee on their
work, and we feel that the parade
was up to its usual high standard,
if not above."

In the sweepstakes race, Delta
Tau Delta took first place, Phi
Delta Theta second place, and Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon, third place. Fur-
ther particulars on the race may
be found on the sports page.

Students Retested.

For Tuberculosis

Students who took last week’s
tuberculosis ‘tests and revealed 9.
negative reaction should report
back today, tomorrow, or Wednes-
day for a second strength.

Although the negative reaction
indicates absence of the disease, a
second strength should be given to
assure absolutely that no tubercu-
losis germs are present. «

If a student showed a positive
reaction, he should arrange for an
X-ray. This will be given for $2.00,
the cost of the ﬁlm. The X-ray will
be taken and read by a competent
X-ray technician and physician.

been chosen as one of the 60 best
educational books of 1941.

Dr. Davis collaborated with
John D. Lawther, professor in

$tamp$alesNear$10,000

General MacArthur d-ay was
a smashing success on campus
last Wednesday as members of
the defense stamp committee
aided by the women of Kappa
Kappa Gamma again brushed
aside standing records to rock-
et the campaign’s total close
to the $10,000 mark.

Largest single purchase of the

drive was made Wednesday when,

Phi Delta Theta, social fraternity,
bought $1,850 in defense bonds.

Also aidingain. this tribute to
America’s chieftain of the South-
west Paciﬁc was Omicron Delta
Kappa, honorary activities frater-
nity, which bought $200 worth of
bonds.

Setting a new record in a single
day’s totals, the stamp and bond
salesmen took in $3,201. Bond to-
tals also hit a new high, soaring to
$2,931.25, while stamp sales total-
ed $269.75. A

The -ground ﬂoor elevator lobby
and the stamp sales booth were
decorated with posters and pic-
tures of MacArthur. One picture
showed MacArthur posing with
Chancellor Bowman, and was in-
dicative of a little-known fact,
namely, that in 1932 the University
presented MacArthur an honorary
degree.

Present campaign totals are
$9,752.25, with several weeks still
remaining in the drive. A summer
drive is also being contemplated.

Stamps and bonds will again be
sold on the next regular sales day,
Wednesday, but faculty members
may mail or bring their‘ replies and
money to the committee at any
time. Regular deliveries of faculty
bond purchases will be made on
Wednesday.

Committee members expressed a
desire that other campus groups
and fraternities will follow the ex-
ample set by Phi Delta Theta and
ODK. .

New cadet-colonel, George E.
Jones, M43, will command the Uni-
versity ROTC regiment this sum-
mer and fall, announced Colonel
Edward Kelly, professor of mili-

day when the ‘senior officers left
their posts and formed in single
line facing Col. Kelly. Other tem-
porary junior» officers assumed their
new positions in command of the
regiment at the same time.

In ﬁnal recognition to the seni-
ors who will soon become commis-
sioned officers, the regiment, under
the new officers, was marched in
review before the seniors and Col.
Kelly. _

ﬂag-waving," said Dr. H. C.

Here
is an opportunity to help the
boys in the army, navy, or
marines, by just giving a ht-u
tle of our time for a blood do-
nation,” he remarked.

The donor will experience no dis-
comfort, as a local anesthetic will
be administered before the blood
is withdrawn. There is positively
no danger, as the patient’s blood
pressure, pulse rate, temperature,

and condition of blood are record- -

ed before hand. If the record indi-

cates danger, the volunteer will be ' '

advised not to give any blood.

Afterwards, the donor will ran . A
ceive a free luncheon to help coma '

pensate for the lost blood.

Volunteers may live as usual boa ’;

fore giving the blood, ‘but must

not eat any fatty foods such as A
cream or butter for four hours

previously. ,

The blood is sent to a laboratory
where it is processed into dry plas-
ma, made ready for use as a trans-
fusion, and sent to the army and
navy for distribution. It is used in
the treatment of shock and hem-
orrhage where and as it occurs in
battle.

served for disaster relief work in
the case of hurricanes, ﬂoods, ﬁres,
explosions, or sabotage. Blood plas-
ma may be kept for as long as
live years without deteriorating.

The army has asked for 1,000,-
000 pints of blood. The present ob-
jective of the Pitsburgh chapter of
the American Red «Cross has been
set at 1,150 pints weekly.

“It cannot bé repeated too often,”
stated Dr. Carlson, “that there is
no pain or danger involved." The
anesthetic assures against any pain.
Careful scientific research has
proven that there is no danger."

As a. service to the donor, his
blood is “typed" and he is inform-
ed of his blood group. This infor-

mation may be of great use to thi T

donor in some future emergency-

involving his own life or the life 

of a friend. i

DTD Fine Upheld By

Fraternity Committee

Delta Tau Delta, social frater-
nity has been ﬁned $75 and placed

, on probation for “in effect” hold-

ing an “event ‘which violated, in
spirit, the social rules, of the Uni-

versity.” This action was taken by-

Men’s Fraternity committee on
April 10, following an appeal for
reconsideration of a previous SFA
Social committee ruling by the
Delts.

The reason behind the suspen-
sion concerns a party which the
Delts held on January 16, the night
of the Junior Prom and which they
claimed to have been a private af-
fair. SFA social committee, the
Dean of Men, and the fraternity
faculty adviser had warned, before
the event, that it appeared a.vio-
lation of the social rules.

r But the Delts held‘ the event

violation, and ﬁned the Delts $75.,

The Men’s Fraternity committee
ratiﬁed the Social committee’s de-
cision. Then it turned out that SFA
Social committee had not held a
trial. And so Delta Tau Delta ask-

ed Men’s Fraternity committee to’

reconsider their decision. A

The committee agreed to this,
set aside the previous decisions of
the Social committee, and review-
ed the evidence.

The committee’s ﬁnal decision
was that the Delta Tau Delta event
was »a violation, and “that because

We’re taking on a new sense of values. ‘ .

Properly, we’re deemphasizing certain extracurricular
and curricular activityto make room for the new program--
the war program. We’re going to convert all that energy that
we’ve been giving to elaborate ceremonies, into a more potent,
and——for the present—-—more important strength.

. . One of the steps in our new set-up will be the donation
of blood. ’ i

y , _ For some of us this is an old story; these people will give
their blood without question. For others, it’s like a ,baby’s ﬁrst
step—-—looks frightening but doesn’t hurt a bit.“

N obody’s g_oing to have to hog-tie us into donating a pint
of blood if we’re physically able to do it. We know exactly how
necessary and how valuable such a donation will be; we know

. that, since a mobile blood bank unit will be here today to ad-

minister the treatment, it will take only a fewminutes of our
time.

., Sure we’re busy. But we’re never so busy or so unintelligent
that we need a lot of half-baked, slushy propaganda to tell us

- a what we have to do to win a war.

The Red Cross unit will be on campus three days. It’s true

we’re being honored by having it here, but when we go all out

' for the campaign", it won’t be just to make a good showing for
the University, even though it’s a nice thought.

No‘, :we’re not giving our blood just for the show of it; it’s

, ‘something much bigger than that. It’s a wife and husband

together again, it’s a child alive, it’s a major battle of the big
lﬁght.

 Students and faculty can register today at either one of
tlie health services—the men’s on the thirty-fourth ﬂoor, the

q_Women’s on the twenty—eighth.

We hope they’ve got plenty of needles, because we’ll all

ilebe there.

Bucimell Beats Pitt, 3-6

T, Pitt’s 1942 baseball team lost its
first chance to better last season’s
ﬁne record as they fell before a su-
perior Buclgnell team, 8 to 6, in the
Stadium opener on Saturday.

Some 250 fans were on hand at
the beginning of the game but the
near freezing temperature and an
icy wind that swept over the Stad-
ium combined to leave but a mere
58 fans still in their seats at the

end.

George Ranii started for the Pan-
thers with Zukas behind the plate,
and the Bucknell Bisons countered
with veteran Phil Stamm. It took
little time, however, for the Bison’s
to solve Ranii’s southpaw» sants
and Joe VVilk took over in the third.
\’Vilk lasted until the eighth when

he was relieved by Bill McKee.

~ The Bisons pounded the Panther

moundsmen for twelve hits while

the Panthers, who lived up to their
pre-season rating as-a weak hitting

outﬁt, could collect only six from
Stamm, who went the distance for
Bucknell.

Bucknell got off to an early lead
in the first inning when they scored
two runs after two men had been
retired. Second baseman Willard
Ronk dropped a single in short
right. Keegan, the shortstop, then
doubled to left to score Ronk with
the first run of the game. A single
by ﬁrst baseman Paul Burke sent
Keegan home and the Bisons held
a two run lead, a lead that they
never lost.

They picked up two more runs
in the third on two walks and a
pair of doubles by Keegan and
Ronk, and added three in the
fourth on just one hit, aided and
abetted, however, by errors, a
passed ball, and three more walks.

The Panthers had had just one
hit. going into their half of the

fourth when Johnny Brown sent a

double to center. This, plus an in-
ﬁeld out and a passed ball, gave
Pitt its first run. Pitt added an-
other run in the seventh, but in

Phi Gains Cop l-F Track
Meet; PiKAs, Runner-Up

By MIKE HERMAN

6 Phi Gamma Delta once again has
come up with a championship track
team. For the third time running,
and for the fourth time in the last
five years, the boys from Walling-
ford St. ha\ 3 come up with a squad
strong enough to take the Inter-
fraternity track meet toga. This
year’s outfit which was one of the
strongest in years scored 47%:
points, with runner—up Pi Kappa.
Alpha challenging with 38.

The Phi Cams were, as usual,
well represented, and the final re-
sults showed Phi Gam points in all

but two events. The scorer gave-

them four ﬁrsts, two seconds, a
tie for second, and two thirds.
_ They failed to place in the shot
put and the hop, step, and jump,
but a first and second in the pole
vault, and a first and a tie for sec-

for fourth to give them 38 points
and second place in the meet.

Third place was won by Theta
Chi with 20 points, while Delta Tau
Delta took fourth with 16% and Phi
Epsilon Pi ﬁfth with 16. The Phi
Delts and the SAE’s split sixth
place with 13 apiece, and SAM plac-
ed last ‘with one lone point.

their half, of the eighth the Buck-
nellians got two.

Pitt countered with two in the
same .frame, the main feature of
which was Johnny Brown's double
that soared into the
stands.

Pitt added some excitement in
the last half of the ninth when
they threatened briefly and man-
aged to score two runs. But it was
not enough and Bucknell departed
the winner.

Incidentally it was so cold that
many of the spectators took to
watching the game from the Stad-
ium Press Boxes. Some baseball
fans even brought along portable
radios so that they could not only
watch the Pitt game but keep up
with the Pirate-St. Louis score as
wéll.

Panther Cinsclermen Beat?
Tech in Handicap Meet

Carnegie Tech’s outdoor cinder
men gave Pitt a little opposition
last Saturday afternoon in prepa-
ration for the oncoming Penn Re-
lays next Friday and Saturday
when they copped one of the four
events in a dual handicap meet.

The Panther’s famed mile-relay
team of Carter, Smith, Peretic, and
Stickel gave the Skibos an 80-yard
lead, and easily overtook them in
the time of 3:26.0. This was prob-
ably the only bright spot in an
otherwise dreary, cold afternoon.
“Bullet Bill" led off and closed the
gap to about 50 yards. Smith fol-
lowed by clipping off 10 more,
then Peretic and Stickel edged past
their rivals.

In the 880-yard run, junior Bob
Davis was clocked in at 2:063”), with
the Tartan varsity half-miler close
on his heels.

The only race in which the rival!
from across the hollow won was
the mile run. Coach Olson spotted
the Techites a 100—yard start, but
apparently it was a bit too much
for either Curtis or Allias to over-
come. Curtis overtook three of
the four Tech men on the last bend
to ﬁnish second in the time of 4238.

Bill Curtis, Pitt’s sensational
cross country star, came back later
in the afternoon by winning the
two mile run in 10:18. Curtis and
Allias gave the Tartan tracksters
a 200-yard lead, and ﬁnished well

ahead of their rivals.

Pitt will continue their practice
sessions all this week for the Penn
Relays. Coach Olson is undecided,
at this writing, just what members
of the Panther squad will be mak-
ing the trip.

man from Ben Avon. Bezdek an-
chored his mates to victories in the
two relay events’ and took a third
in the 100-yard dash. Other valu-

claimed that the Phi Gams had not
established immediate contact be-
tween the fourth and ﬁfth pushers.

The rules call for 20-yard zones

to be marked off in which the ex-
change of pushers must be made.
The Phi Gam cart, however, shot
past the ‘fourth exchange post at
such a terrific rate that pusher
Bezdek could not catch it till it
was well past the post. The Delts
protested immediately after the
race, and the judges disqualiﬁed
the Phi Gam entry. ,

The Phi Cams retaliated by
pointing out that the exchange
zones were only 10 yards long,
claiming that Bezdek would have
caught the car had the zone been
20 yards long. I

As things now stand, we have
the Delts in first, timed at 13:02.7,
the Phi Deltsin second at 3:15.5,
the SAE’s third at 3:20.0, the
PiKA’s fourth with 3:37.8, and
the Phi Eps and Pi Lams bringing
up the rear at 23:45.0 and 3:46.15,
respectively.

These results are neither final
nor official, and should the judges
allow the Phi Gains claim, each
team will be moved back one notch

Fourteenth of the nationality

rooms to be constructed in the Ca-
thedral, the French room is sched-
uled to be opened this summer.

The room, a gift of the French
government, is of late French em-
pire design. It was originally plan-
ned by Jacques Carlu, director of
the school of ﬁne arts at Fontaine-
bleau, architect-in-chief of the Tro-
-eadero, and former professor o
architectural design at the Massa-
-chusetts Institute of Technology.

Other outstanding features of
the room will be the highly polish-
ed Versailles-patterned ﬂoor, the
mahogany chairs with green leath-
er seats, and the two large crystal
chandeliers.

A cream and bronze color scheme,
to blend with the mahogany wood-
work and dark green satin drapes,
has been planned‘ by Albert A.
Klimchek, University architect, and
Paul Kret, outstanding exponent
of French architecture in this
country.

A wall painting will occupy the
chief focal point in the room, op-
posite a vitrine containing a collec-
tion of French objets d’art, a gift
of the French room committee.

Money has yet to be raised for
the furniture, but sufficient funds
have permitted work to be begun
in the ﬂooring, plastering,.and wir-
ing. The room has also been en-
larged to include the previously
planned kitchenette between the
French and English rooms in order
to provide a larger classroom.

PlTT'S CONCERT BAN

PI... For Children 2 Plays

At University

Three children’s plays, given last
Wednesday in Foster Memorial,
may be the beginnings of a chil-
dren’s theater at Pitt if the hopes
of Buell Whitehill, director of Pitt
Players, ever materialize.

For several years Mr. Whitehill
has wanted to start a children's
theater here but only this year,
with the aid of three‘freshman
women's units, acting, stagecraft,
and fashion units, has he ever been
able to make any progress at all
toward his goal.

These units combined to produce
three plays from which he hopes
will develop - enough interest to
start a children's theater.

The plays will be presented be-
fore various childrens groups dur-
ing the next three weeks.

Take Form

The plays are: “Little Black
Sambo,” directed by Sidney Siegel,
Ed42; “The Elf Child,” Bill Wil-
son,-BA42, director; “Six Who Pass
While the Lentils Boil,” directed by
Otto Kren, Ed43, all members of
Whitehill’s production classes.

Mary Rita Keenan, Ed43, is ad-
viser to the acting unit; Rica Spie-
gel, Ed43, sponsors the stagecraft
group which has made the sets;
and Suzanne Becker, C43, spon-
sors the fashion unit, which has
made the costumes.

During the next three weeks the
acting group will present their
plays at Frick school, Children’s
hospital, Soho Community" house,
Sarah Heinz ‘Community house,
and in the childrens ward of the
Mercy hospital.
