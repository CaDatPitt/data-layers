Incumbents on Ballot
For Coming Election

Twenty—three nominees of the
Alumni Association will be plac-
ed before the members of the.
as’-sociat'ion onJFricla_v to ﬁll thir-
teen vacancies on the Board of’
Trustees which the alumni
ic].a'in;1 will’be_ open in June.‘ .

elect new members. A

Johnson Accepts

Contrary to the stand of the
Alumni Association, a University
spokesman has pointed out that the
terms of only nine members expire
this year because of a system of
internal classiﬁcation of the mem-
bers of the board. .~

In 1937 the Alumni elected 13
nominees to the board, all of whom
were accepted. This election follow-
ed a quarrel in which former Gov-
ernor George H. Earle intervened
and proposed the plan under which
the alumni would elect members of
the board.

Among. the nine present board
members who are on the alumni
list is Holgar J. Johnson, president
of the Institute of Life Insurance,
who has accepted nomination by
the association although he was a
member of the trustee nominating
committee which proposed an al-
ternate plan of election which
would greatly reduce the powers of
the Alumni Association.

Balloting Conﬂicts with Plan .

This balloting is carried out in
conflict with the plan proposed by
the nominating committee of the
trustees, headed by Samuel A. Tay-
lor.

Candidates for the alumni trus-
tee election are: William C. Ar-
thur, president of Talon, Inc.; E.
V. Babcock,’ former mayor of Pitts-
burgh; Arthur E. Braun, president
of Farmers National bank and Re-
liance Life Insurance company;

Parking Group,

Removes Ban

Unlimited parking on the Univer-
sity side of Fifth avenue is expected
to become effective May 8.

The engineering sub-committee
recommendation to remove the 2-
hour parking restriction on Fifth
avenue between Bigelow boulevard

and Belleﬁeld avenue was passed:

by the Better Traflic committee last
Thursday.

The committee, however, also ap-
proved a no-parking regulation
from 8 o’clock until 9:30 o’clock in
the morning and between 6:30

o’clock and 8 o’clock in the even,-i_ng__

along specific areas on Parkman,
Lytton, and Tennyson avenues and
Bigelow boulevard.

Director George E. A. Fairley of
the department of public safety will
read the recommendations to the
city council today.

“We, expect it (Fifth avenue
parking) to become effective about
May 8,” declares Morris Naumoff,
secretary of the Better Traffic com-
mittee . . . “but the no-parking re-
striction on adjacent streets prob-
ably will go into eﬁect about 10
days later.”_

Naumoff claims that the addition-
al time will be required to paint the
signs and work out details for the
no-parking enforcement.

_ According ‘to the officer in charge
of parking in Schenleyx plaza, Uni-

‘versity students may park their

cars in the center area of the plaza
until 12:30.

Novelty Day Merriment
Calls for Sloppy Clothes

Old coats, old shoes, no ties, patched pants-—it’s not the daily-line-up
at the Friendly Inn, but the expected attire of the Universitystudents to-
morrow as they get ready for a rip-roaring day of fun.“

Novelty Day chairmen, Bill Sherris, BA41, and Bob Shaw, Ed41, hope
that the “old clothes” will be of decided beneﬁt in getting the students
ready for the plans made by the committee for the afternoon’s events,

Starting at 2:30 o’clock a water
battle with real’ ﬁre hoses borrowed
from the city ﬁre department will
be staged in front of Trees Gym.

The opposing teams will be made-

up of fraternity and independent
men. - ‘

A hoop race for girls haslhbeen,

scheduled to begin at 3:10 o’clock.
and will be followed by a tug of
war battle. The ﬁrst team to pull
the marker over the line twice will
be declared the winner.

Saddle shoes ‘Sl_1'0l,ll,d'"'bV£ included
in the day's attire, because -they are
the fee of admission to the shoe race.»
Girls versus boys is the set-up, with
the shoes being divided into two
piles ‘and followed by the wild
scramble to see: whoowns which
shoe. ‘ _

afternoon which, is, expected to
bring the tops in team rivalry is

Bawdy   Politics
I Lowdown on Downlow
Campus M achinations

By S. F. Ayers

You might as well call it a black out on [the campus
politicalifront this week for even the inside politicians
are deﬁnitely in the dark. In the center ofithe. fog are
Interfraternity Council, "SEA executive committee, and
I\/Ien’s Council. _ A I

On the rain"-swept side of the lines, the Independent

partyvvwent into a semi-oﬁ“1cial, between-class caucus
within a matterof hours after elections—and the latest

is that‘ they haveonly one seat on their SFA,;executive A

committee slate labelled "‘certain,” even now.

Parke Set for MC

Political “sharpers”' saw more than one prediction go
out the window last Friday whenthe slated oﬁices in
Men’s.‘ C_ouncil—_ab0ut everyone is ‘now agreed that MC
is no longer a Junior Interfraternityy Council——received
a wholesale reshuf-‘ﬂing over the week-end. Al Ludwig,
Theta Chi stand-by, walked out of the MC presidency
into top IF Council post. This means one thing: Don

‘ Parke, Kappa Sigma, is now deﬁnitely in line for the’
, IF presidency. He was originally slated to be second in

command. Dick Gardner, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, origi-

nally in.the books as secretary, will have to choose be- '

tween that post or vice-president.

There’s just one thing that ‘is certain, the chances
for an Independent president of ’Men’s Council stand
at about 500 to 0. In fact, we’ll give a carton of
Sma.rter’s Little Lover Pills to the. Independent that
walks off with the job.

SF A In Hibernation ‘ :

The fog that has recently descended upon SFA is
really impressive; . That unique -deliberative body has
been ‘in recent weeks afflicted with about as bad a case

V of procrastination as the opening of the Tuck Shop and

the local baseball season.

When the forty members do ﬁnally get together-
probably on Tuesday, May 14-—-to elect six student mem-
bers of the Executive Committee, the current foggy -con-
ditions may clear up considerably. At’ present writing

' the fraternity block seems likely to divide their 19 stu-

dent votes behindtwo slates.

The stronger of these will be composed of Joe Rob-
erts, Phi Gam; Dave Buente, Delt; and Gene Pyle,
Kappa. Hitched to this strong combination will be the
none-too-promising Phi Delta Theta trailer. Rae Young,
Phi Delt; Mary Lewis, Theta; and either Harold Wintner,
SAM; or Jack Glenn, Phi Kap, will ride this second-
mortgage vehicle.

Headaches for GDIS

1 Each member of SFA, by the way, votes for two
men a.nd one woman; it is expressly stipulated that
two women must be included on the Executive Com-
mittee.

First headache for the Independents following last
month’s election was the composition of their Executive
Committee slate. Adele Yorio was conceded seat num-
ber one from the beginning. The “ﬁght” for the two
remaining seats had all but narrowed down to Fred
Robie, Bill McElwain, and Dave Tucker, when a second
affliction came to a head in the party leadership. Under
the banner of “balanced representation” three of the
four Independent junior men bounced up from their
initial success at the polls with a demand for a junior
man on the Executive Committee. This “glorious rev-
olution” ﬁzzled out in two days.

We can’t quite match Dr. Church’s
offer of a million dollars which he

made for the capture of Hitler but

SOS Radio Poll Indicates Low
Level of Collegiate Culture

In the Student Opinion Surveys
of America, it was revealed last
week that Jello’s Benny provokes
more laughs among collegians than
does Pepsodent’s Hope. All of
which proves that Jello dissolves to
a belly-laugh and Pepsodent merely
polishes off a grin. Perhaps Brenda
and Cobina are too subtle for
America’s cum lauders.

The poll also sent Professor
Goodman a country-mile ahead of
Toscannini and his NBC Symphony
orchestra. This fact should make
the ‘ignored teachers of music ap-
preciation more frustrated than
ever. It is proof in black and white
of what they have for so long been
suspecting, but always considered
mere pessimism. The hep-cats are
more numerous as well as noisier
than the Tschaikovsky lovers. The
tuition—paying masses prefer—but
vociferously——“beating it out” to the
digniﬁed crescendo.

And whose to blame? Deﬁnitely,
our educators. They encourage
balls and hops, at which the man

who blows the trumpet loudest and
the man who beats the drums fast-
est feast on the allowances of stu-
dents. An average of about 30
school sponsored dances are held
here each year. The dances are al-
ways well publicized and well at-
tended. Mo-st of the students deem
it an honor to act as dance chair-
men, which means contracting an
orchestra—with faculty aid——and
being pictured in the News.

But what of University sponsored
concerts‘? The student symphony
appears on campus approximately
twice each year, and is seldom well
received. Orchestra stories are ac-
corded a minimum of news space,
simply because there is little inter-
est in what the orchestra is doing.
The ticket take at concerts is in-
variably small.

It is difficult to conjecture on the
ultimate diversion of the current
curriculum consumers when, as is
inevitable. “swing” ignominiously
expires. Of course, they can a1-
ways ﬁght for democracy.

Common Sense

Church Offer Shows
Lack of Understanding

By Gerald Ziskind

Samuel Harden Church extends one million dollars
to any person apprehending Herr Hitler in order that
he (Hitler) may be brought before a court of justice.
The proposition is unsound. First, because the amount
offered is inﬁntesimally small considering the task pre-
sented; for, as we know, the Allied powers will essen-
tially have to spend three hundred billion dollars to
perform this same feat. And second, Mr. Church, by
the implications of his proposal, displays an inaccurate
conception of the motivating forces behind German bar-
barity.

He apparently attributes German aggression to the
one superﬁcial factor of Hitler’s directing the helm of
state. He ignores the uncontrovertible fact that Hitler
is but the end, normal result of a history and national
outlook latent with the love of force and militarism
inﬂamed by the furious obsession of “superiority.”

Not Indicting a People

Let no man accuse me of indicting the German

   

people as such. For Germany, since the .dayS of the
Holypj-Roman Empire, has had no self government_
worthy of mention. She" has been an Aristocracy. - This _
is the Aristocracy of “manifest destiny’-’ which has.
cursed the world with its mad exploits.” This is V the’
Aristocracy which must be" crushed if Germany is to.

enter the realm of civilized nations.

 ‘ The Germany of today, as in thepast, is a’ mere‘ ex-
j pression of this Aristocracy. I cannot quote their num-

ber. Nor can I” identify them all. But they are the

"men whose antecedents had Nietzsche as their ‘spokes-
.- Uman. I They revelled at his pronunciamentos of the
f“Blond Beast.” Their gods were Wotan and the Val-
I kyries. They‘ were the men who later adopted iI§‘ich,te

as their patron. saint, the Fichte who ‘identiﬁed German
blood as containing the minerals and elements of Ger-

_, man ‘soil, the one never to be separted from the other.

They ﬁockedto Bismarck in his ruleiof “bloodiand
iron.” They encouraged the Kaiser who promised his

. people bullets rather than ballots. And now they march

with Hitler. .-
They W’ ant to [Fight

What do these German Aristocrats want‘? Who can
appease them? Do they seek a better life for Germans?
No, these men are not in quest of raw materials, or more
land, or greater “living space.” That is simply their
outward slogan. They are out to ﬁght and wage war
for sport, for expression of their traits of “superiority.”
They are like Nietzsche, an irrational and inhumane lot,
bent on proving the “Great Racial Myth” to the world.

Blame the present war on the Treaty of Versailles

and you are expressing the “acceptc,_d.” opinion nowa- ,

days. But Versailles was lenient indeed if Germany
chose to live in peace and right. She did not pay one
cent indemnities as we loaned her every cent she paid
to the Allies. And what land she lost was inhabited by
alien peoples. Contrast this to France’s immediate re-
payment to Germany of the indemnities imposed upon
herand the giving up of her iron ore lands resulting
from her defeat in the Franco-Prussian VVar.
Chamberlain could not have appeased these Aristo-
crats had be given them the whole British Empire. For
they must ﬁght and ravish and plunder-—-how else can
And Hitler is their spokes-
man. . l -

W/hat Churchill M cans

So when Alfred Duff Cooper or Winston Churchill
asserts “we are ﬁghting the German people” they mean
this fanatical class of -Germans. They are the men, who
with Hitler, must be brought to trial before the con-

science of the world.. _ ,
The Allied powers must rip the last vestige of

,Nietzsche and Fichte out of German life. They cannot

do it by conquering one or two men. They must wage

war to the end. And only out of the smouldering ruins '

of a devastated Germany can there berevived hope for
a better world order. ‘

Miss Hoffman «started her lecture by introducing a

She‘ showed a. series of slides which». were -taken on

material for her series of sculpture of racial types. This

Included in the slides were various types of arma-
tures which can be used in modeling a head.

She also showed the evolution of a statue of Pav-

preliminary sketches to the ﬁnished product, the bronze
cast. ‘

After her slides, she showedlher ﬁlm on the “Mak-
ing of the International Dance Fountain at the,New

showed every difficult phase in constructing this huge
piece of sculpture.

Speaking to those who were just entering the ﬁeld
of art, she said that it was a great thing to be poor, par-
ticularly at ﬁrst. She also said that sculpture tied the
intelligence of the mind to the ﬁngers.

Miss Hoffman disproved all contentions that great
artists are shy, maladjusted introverts.

Split Even
With W. Va.

Kish ‘Wins Friday, 7-3:,
Johnson, Bonelli Drop
Saturday’s Game, 10-8

Playing in the worst kind of
baseball weather, which includ-
ed rain, wind, and uea1"—freezing
temperature, Pitt’s diamond
team still managed to split their
two game series with \V'est \"ir.-
ginia Friday and Saturday.

A four run rally in the ﬁrst in-
ning was all the Panthers needed to
bring them their ﬁrst victory of the
season Friday afternoon when they
downed the. Mountaineers by a 7-3
count. , ‘

Cold weather and rain threatened
to force postponement of the game.
scarcely a- handful of spectators

came out to see Pitt down the vis-

itors.
Katz Hits Triple

- J Pitt went to work -immediately‘ in

the ﬁrst inning when Bush singled,
Katz scored him with a ‘blazing
triple, and Jones tallied Katz with
a single. Two walks, an error and
a scratch single accounted for the
other two runs.

The second time the
tallied more than once _was in the
sixth when footballer Jones singled

with the basesiloaded. . West, Vir-

ginia scored its runs when Criss-
man homered.

Fastballer Ben Kish maintained
the Pitt lead throughout the latter
innings by his almost perfect con-
trol. The Pitt hurler allowed the
Mountaineers an even half dozen
hits.

Sloppy ‘Fielding _

Errors_ and walks predominated
as the Morgantown nine gained a
10-8 decision Saturday. V

~Lefthander Andy Johnson start-
ed for the Panthers and, after
yielding eight hits, seven walks,
and two wild pitches, gave away
to Ernie Bonelli in the eighth.
Bonelli also hit a wild streak in
the ninth, walking three men and
allowing rtwo hits for three runs
after two were out. Johnson was
the losing pitcher, and Johnny Ben-
nett, who was in trouble most of
the game, the winner.

Strause Homers

Two walks and a homer by Char-

ley Strause gave West Virginia
three runs in the ﬁrst, and awalk.
a double and three errors account-
ed for two more in the second. The
Mountaineers tallied once in the
sixth on a walk, a sacriﬁce, and a
single, and once again in the eighth
on a walk, a wild pitch, and an er-
ror. .
Three singles, a base on balls, and
some fancy base-running by Guy
Guadagnino produced three Pitt
runs in the second. Pitt scored two
more in the third on an error, a
hit batter, and Goeltz’s double.

Shortstop _;jGrossman’s two mis-
cues and Hefty Drobneuskfs two

Jones Returns
To Lead Blues
11125-0 Victory

Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones
put in his ﬁrst appearance of the
spring in an intra—squad football
game Saturday, and it seemed to
be just what the Blue team needed
to make up for two previous losses
to the Whites. Charley Bowser’s
ﬁrst stringers chalked up a 25-0
victory.

Jones made his presence felt in
the second period by
across the goal line on an 85 yard
run. When Joe Rettinger kicked
the extra point, the Blues had a
permanent lead. .

Shortly afterward fullback
George Kracum hit centerilor 15
yards, lateralled to Jones, and Ed-
die was away on a touchdown play
that ate up 35 yards.

Although Jones was then excus-
ed to go down to the Stadium and
take part in the baseball game, the
Blues continued to click with fresh-
man Frank Saksa in Jones’ place.

Sophomore Track Men

Outsparkle Veterans

Stickel, Rhoades, J essllp, Elliott, Pile Up Points
As Olsenmen Whi1) Strong I11dia'na._Squa'd', 72-59

By Ben Foote
When Pitt’s supposedly well—established track stars faltered, a crowd
of promising sophomores jumped to the fore to give the Panther cinder
squad its ninth straight dual meet victory, a 72-59 win over Indiana
University’s crack outfit at the Stadium last Saturday. , (Note: Pitt News

prediction, Pitt 69-Indiana 62.

Hampered by the frosty atmo-
sphere and a sl.ow track, the ath-
letes failed to register any out-
standing marks, with the exception
of dusky Hoosier Archie Harris
who tossed the discus 164 feet 11/2
inches.

At the very outset of the pro-
gram, things appeared about as
bleak as the weather for the Pitt
‘team, for at the conclusion of the
mile run and 440 yard dash, the
Big Ten squad led 16-2. Long-
legged Campbell Kane breezed

through a 4:26 mile with‘ teammate _-

Hedges right on his heels, while
Al Boulanger, the highly-touted
Pitt distance ace, trailed in third
place.

Ohl Gives Out

Indiana captain Roy Cochrane
outsmarted Frank Ohl to capture
the 440 yard dash in 49.2 seconds.
The shock—haired Hoosier ﬁyer took
the lead immediately and poured
it on around the first curve while
Ohl struggled on the outside. Down
the backstretch the thrilling duel
continued, but Ohl tied up in the
homestretch. Cochrane had to sum-
mon every ounce of reserve, then,
to withstand the sudden surge
frontward of Jenkins and Pitt’s Bud
Graf who placed second and third
respectively.

After that Coach Carl Olson’s
sophomores piled up enough points
to send the Panthers into the lead.
Happy Stickel, the blonde sprint

star, copped the 100 yard dash in ..

 

10 seconds and the yearling pole
vaulting twins, Dusty Rhoades
and Red Jessup, didn’t have to to

‘take their sweatclothes off to tri-

umph in their specialty at 1.2 feet.
Newman Surprises

Junior Joe Newman surprised his
favored Indiana rivals, Mikulas and
Denny, and streaked in ahead in
the 120 yard high hurdles in 15.3
seconds. Kane came back to beat
Panther Del Anderson in the half
mile in the slow time of 2:00.6.

The Hoosier distance stars Tol-
liver ar:d I-ledges then administer-
ed another sound lacing to Bou-
langer, last year's two mile
satellite. Johnny Bazyk, veteran
weight star, upset Harris, Big Ten
indoor titlist, to win the shot put.
Sophmores Jim Elliott and Rhoades
placed one-two in the javelin, but
Mikulas gave Indiana the high
jump with a mediocre leap of six
feet two.

Stickel Scores Double

Stickel became the ﬁrst spiked
shoe star of the meet to score a
double when he nipped Ohl by
inches in the 220. Cochrane scor-
ed the second double as he romped
over the low timbers ahead of New-
man and Stickel.

In the mile relay Tregoning came
in with a five yard advantage, that
was stretched to 15 by Anderson
and Graf. McKee then held off a
desperate Kane challenge and
breasted the tape ﬁve yards to the
good.

Phi Delts Hope for Repeat Victory
Against 12 Greek Rivals at Stadiuiii
By Alex Zelenski ’
Spring Fe-s.tival’s outstanding contribution to the G-reeks, the I-17 track

meet. will take place tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 o’clock in the Pitt Stadium.
Phi Delta Theta literally ran away with the crown last year as they

scored 11 points more than their closest rivals, the Phi Gams.

Sigma and Delta Tau Delta. were in
third and fourth place respectively.

The title holding"Phi Delts were
largely aided by three football play-
ers, two of whom will not see action
this year due to graduation. Johnny
Dickinson, Bob Dannies, and Curly
Stebbins were instrumental in se-
curing the Phi Delt championsho.
Dickinson won two ﬁrsts. and anch-
ored the 440 yard relay team. to a
third. His victories were in the
hop-step—jump event and the 220
yard dash.

Phi Gamma Delta won three firsts
and two seconds. Vvinning events
for the Fijis were Bobby Thurbon
with his 10.4, 100 yard dash, Earl
Pressel jumping 5 feet 8 inches, and
Chris Watson’s shot put heave of 47
feet 41/2 inches.

Cusiek Runs

Jimmy Kennedy won the only
first for. the Delta Tau Delta track
team by pole vaulting 10 feet. The
cornbinationof Jones, Geiger, l-lawk-
ins, and Hepburn took one point by
placing third-in the 440 yard relay.

Phi Kappa’s Pat Cusick easily
ou’tdistanced the field in the 440
y:ard' run, being timed, in 55.5.

’l‘l.1?7l40 yard relay race, won by
the championship Phi Delt team,
was the most closely contested of
Gregg, Smith. Dan-

nipped the fast ﬂying Phi Gam and
Delta Tau Delta teams. Roberts,
Grosset, Smith, and Pressel made
up the second place winner.

Panther Tennis
Team Favored
Over Grocers

Pitt’s netmen journey to Grove
City, Pa., tomorrow to duel Grove
City’s mediocre shotmakers in the
first battle of a two match home-
and-home series. .

With Beaver county titleholder
GeorgerMcCloskey driving his pow-
erful forehands from the number
one position and two other veter-
ans shooting from the second and
third niches, the Grover strength
lies chieﬂy in the upper half of the
lineup. But the lower section is
very weak.

From numbers two to six, the
Grovers will use Hulton. Giles,
Westergren, Gillen and Weidler.
Pitt will counter with its usual line-
up of Joe Kristufek, Frances Har-
muth. Ed Goehring, Dudley Weiss,
Frank Gaenger and either Bob Mar-
tin or Bob Nickeson.

Last year the rival court crews
tangled twice, with each outﬁt reg-
istering one victory. The Grovers
defeated Pitt 6-3 on the Trees Gym
rectangles in their ﬁrst skirmish,
but the Panthers avenged them-

selves. 5-4 in the season’s last
3:1.”-‘roll, played at Grove City.
The Panthers scored their ﬁrst

win of the season Saturday, wal-
loping Slippery Rock Teachers, 9-0.
Only Bob Martin was extended
more than the necessary sets to
win.

Joe Kristufek and Ed Goehring
took their singles matches in love
sets; in fact, Pitt’s ﬁrst ﬁve men
lost but seven games. Doubles
competition was equally lopsided,
Kristufek and Nickeson dropping
one game, and Harmuth and Goehr-
ing losing three.

Kappa

   

The 880 yard relay, one of the
most difﬁcult and least participated
in events, saw Kappa Sigma win
their only ﬁrst of the meet by nos-
ing out the Phi Delt quartet. Ed-
munds, Conrad, Kracum, and Wuer-
tenberger were the victorious com-
bination.

Champs Return

Last year’s meet was one of the
most successful in the history of I-13‘
track meets. With the return of
most of the entrants from all the
teams, this year’s meet should find
many previous records falling.

Johnny Dickinson, Bobby Thur-
bon, Pat Cusick, Jimmy Kennedy,
