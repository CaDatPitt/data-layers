faculty housing,.due to high
construction estimates. _ Dr.
Edward. B. Cale, assistant
chancellor of ~'developrnent,
liowever, said, “The, University
has not shelved the design we had
in mind for the houses.” -

This designentails a house with

three stories of living quarters,
which are high above. the ground.

"We will ﬁrst try using more con-»

‘ventional building materials to
bring down the .cost,” said Dr.
Cale. “If. that doesn’t lower it,
then we will alter the design.”

The University had intended to
build one, possibly two futuristic
home on the hillside below. the

Stadium as a study. It would like‘

to eventually build, seventy, ultra-
modern houses there for the fac-
ulty.
. According to Dr. Cale, the Uni-
*versity is now, also, considering
the construction of the seventy
buildings at one time. For consid-
erable savings could‘ -be realized
by buying the materials in large
quantity. , '
Materials for the abandoned

houses. were being given to Pitt.-' *

by the Aluminum Company of
America and other Pittsburgh
corporations. Dr. Cale stated
that’ the University was not
guaranteed any free materials
for the re-designed, houses but
hopes to receive them.

According to one of the archi-
tects in the University’s Depart-
ment of Development, the n-ew
designs for the buildings will be
. made public within three or four
months. ’

9 Memories and eulogies of

Dr. John G.abbert-_ Bowman,
former chancellor ‘_of- the Uni-

versity who" died Sunday «

morning, have been voiced by
many members of ‘the faculty
and administration. Dr. W. Geofge

"Crouch, chairman of the English

Department‘ says that he was an
unusually kind man.

“He had _ a, tremendous _ drive
and I never knew a man w_ho~was
so convincing,” Dr. Crouch said.

' “You could walk into his oiﬁce
swearing ‘that you disagreed with
him and after a half hour in there

you .would be agreeing with" his

point of view.” , .
Dr. Bowman waschancellor of
the University from 1921 until he

resigned in February of 1945. At

that time he was appointed pres-
ident of the University.
Cathedral ‘Erected
Durin-g his yearsas chancellor,
_t‘.-: Cathedralof Learning, which
had always ‘been his dream, was
erected. “He was a" combination
of a hard-headed‘ businessman
and an idealist,” Dr. Crouch said.
“It was the idealism in-him that
led to the Cathedral; ‘He hoped
to inspire students, for years‘ to
come.” a '
Through Dr. Bowman’s. ef-
.forts,- $21 million dollars was
‘raised for expansion purposes.
The Cathedral was built on a

co-operation with the admin-
istrative committee in this
area. V

ID cards are needed to replace
invoices which can “easily be-
come ~lost, misplaced, or torn,”
according to SG committee chair-
man Pete Bijur. “Since. the in-
voice is transferable,” he added,

“this is no real means for identi-
ﬁcation.”

The cards would be used for
admission to athletic events, li-
braries, and generpl student iden-
tiﬁcation. Means for producing a
card at no cost to the student are
under investigation‘. The com-
mittee would like to use Univer-
sity facilities rather than com-
mercial production, Bijur reports.

Tells of Red China

By NANCY FUCHS

“Hungry men are danger-
ous when armed,” declared
John Scott, special Time cor-
respondent, in his talk on

Communist China at Mon-.

day’s Midday Series. Unable

to get into China, Scott traveled
throughout countries on its peri-
phery, talking to businessmen,
diplomats, and refugees in his at-
tempts to evaluate its economy
and relations to other countries.

Prefacing his talk on China,
Scott gave a capsule report of
conditions in the neighboring
countries. He said, “Most have a
better economic status than they
did ﬁve or ten years ago, as
shown, for example, by the rise
of free enterprise and a middle
class in Thailand.” ’

Scott ﬁrst discussed the agri-
cultural aspects of ‘Chinese econ-
omy. “Eleven per cent of China’s
land is arable, compared with 25
per .cent of the United States.
Most of the country is too high
and too arid for agriculture, and
the situation has been more,re-

cently complicated by the failure-

of the Chinese to use scientiﬁc
methods of increasing yields,”
Scott stated.
Three Red Programs

To increase productivity in the
last decade, the Communists have
initiated three programs: land re-
form. (‘50-’5-4), collectivization
('54-’58), and communization (‘58-
’6l). Under the land reform pro-
gram big landowners were tried
and evecuted in an attempt to
engage the rural masses in the
revolution.

“Collectivization brought no
Increase in productivity, and the
communes," which broke up
families to substitute argricul-
tural labor for the capital they
didn't have, reduced reasonably
affluent communities to the
verge of complete malnutri-
tion,” Scot point/gd out.

Scott also added, however, that

i there is no evidence of mass star-

  

vation and that although the food
grain yield the last "few years
has not equaled the all time high
of 193 million tons in 1958, food
production will probably go up
in the future.
People Multiplying

Scott’s explanation for China's
invasion of northern India is that
China is seeking more land for her
exploding population —- a place
where her people can earn an
adequate living. He called China
an “Asian Robin Hood who is
tough’ on big India and easy on
countries like Nepal and Vietnam.
In ten or 20 years the Chinese will
migrate northward and westward
as in the past.”

In respect to Chinese indus-
try, Scott stressed the problem
of capital. “In 1961, China pro-
duced ten million tons of steel,
comparable to U.S. production
in 1900, but with very little to

work with. it was quite 9. per-
formance," Scott noted. '

However, China has suffered
serious industrial‘ indigestion be-
cause the gverenment has been
trying to use a cantralized plan
for the economy, and decentral-
ization has always been charac-
teristic.”

Sees No Purging

Contrary to Chinese Nationalist
opinions, the Chinese Communist
Party is very strong. “There is no
evidence of any purging,” accord-
ing to Scott.

“There is a lot of animosity be-
tween Russians and Chinese. This
conflict is likely to become a ma-
jor element in the latter part of
the century, but until the Chinese
get nuclear weapons (within ten
or more years), it is irrational for
China to have a conﬂict with
Russia,” Scott asserted.

“United States’ relations with
Communist China have been am-
bivalent and highly unsatisfactory,
largely because our public is not
well informed on the subject.
Since the Chinese comprise one-
fourth to one-third of the human
race, we’d be doing ourselves a
favor if we treat with greater in-
terest problems surrounding Com-
munist China,” Scott concluded.

Finals Folly Set
As Dance Theme ,

For all academicall secure stu-
dents, the Student Union is hold-
ing a Finals Folly Friday night
between 9:30 and 12:30 in the
ballroom. ‘

Pre-ﬁnal festivities of this last
SU dance of the trimesterwill be
highlighted by the playing of the
Supremes and refreshments I will
be served.

Invoices will be checked‘ at-the
door and a fee of 25 cents for
stags and 35 cents for couples
will be collected.

The tempo will be a twist and
dress is casual.

Kennedy Line
Dehated Here

(Continued from Page 1)

“This money,” said Cantrell,
"can be used for more im-
portant things like touch foot-_
ball ﬁelds and scene.” In- the
course of his presentation,.Can-
trell quoted from" such authori-
ties in the ﬁeld of politics as
Red Skelton, Caroline Kennedy,
and William Faulkner.

—Steve Schlickman, in his cross-
examination, asked what would
happen if Caroline were elected
and suggested that perhaps a coro-
nation would be, more ﬁtting than
an inauguration. He_ pointed out
that there would have to be- a
new phonetic system put into
effect and that most of usvwould
have trouble with it, especially the
South Carolinians.

Miss Carson, in ‘her presenta-
tion of the negative view, pointed
out disadvantages of the affirma-

tive. The plan would be detri-

m e n t a 1 economically because
money would have to be spent on
such projects as revamping the
entire educational -system," switch-
ing for instance from Dick and

Jane readers to Caroline’ and Jun- ’

ior Readers. .. A

“Also,” said Miss _ Carson, “in
most every political monarchy
there has beenvcorruption. Hianis
Port might become the next Ver-
sailles.” ’

Schlickman, in summarizing
the negative view, said that the
plan is bad all the way around.
As a ﬁnal plea, he added, “Let’s
not make Joe the father ‘of our
country.”

Immediately following the de-
bate, Alan Cazen, president of
WPDU presented the trophies and
awards ‘for the tournament.

First place for hte Top Team
Trophy went to Alabama.
Southern Illinois ra na close
second and a University team,
composed of Joseph, Cazen,’

The WPDU B team was award-
ed ﬁrst place in the Affirmative
Trophy competition, but were in-
eligible for the award, so it was
given to Dusuesne. Washington
and Lee was second. ‘First place
in the Negative Trophy division
was Southern Illinois. Second was

The ID Idea

The question of the establishment of student identiﬁ-
cation cards is one which should be considered with care.
Just how great alneed exists for the cards must be evalu-
ated, as well as what they will be able to do that the present
tuition receipt is transferrabl—as transferrable as a dollar
bill. This fact is probably quite irksome to the administra-
tion, as they often have no control over who is allowed to
do What in whatever campus facility under which name. , I

It is doubtful that the easy transferability of the tui-
tion receipt particularly bothers any of the students. In

general," the present identiﬁcation plan seems to adequately

serve well.

In actuality, the only reason presented so far for adopt-
ing the expensive, lamenated ID card is that it will not
“easily become lost, misplaced or torn.” Naturally, if one
is prone to lose things, he can misplace a- plastic card as
easily as a folded sheet of paper. And if physical wear is
the case, we should remember that the ID card would serve
for one’s entire time at college, whereas a new tuition re-
ceipt is issued at the beginning of each term.

’As expressed by the Student Government ID card
committee chairman, the new plan would allow the student
to be better identiﬁed. In just what particular instances a
student would have to be better identiﬁed than he is now
have not been brought forth. Until they are, we ﬁnd this an‘
extremely weak reason for the proposed ‘change.

Last but far from least is the problem of the cost of
the ID cards. The University has expressed its desire, not to
burdent the student body with a new expense——that of the
ID card. But if the card is to be a plastic package contain-
ing a photograph of its owner, someone will have to foot
the bill. Past experience has shown that too often, the stu-
dent is the likely victim of school expense. I

The idea of ID cards as used on other campuses and as
once used here in days gone by has not yet been proven to
be of any considerable value to the student while the less
expensive, more facile tuition receipt plan seems‘ to work
Well enough.

  
  
 

 
 

Self Sufficient Society...

 

 

Being and

 

Americans have in the recent times been too
self critical of the fact that they are a nation of
joiners. Fear has been expressed
quarters that the modern day men and women are
beginning to identify themselves
with their groups‘ or organiza-
tions and are slowly but surely
losing their individuality and
identity.

I think this panic has little
or no basis for support, for be-
longing to some group is the in-
herent nature‘ of man. He has
looked for companionship from
the beginning of time when God
created Adam and Eve. Whether
his group consists of his imme-
diate family, closev circle of friends, business asso-

ciates, or fellow members of social or honorary

in certain

’ group, the individual has to ﬁnd his niche in life.

From the days of the caveman the gregarious

nature in man has made‘ him form societies‘ and

live together, and when not always comfortable in
his surroundings he has tended to form a smaller
group within the larger one. Yet all through the
generations, people have retained their individual-
ity even when belonging to groups. It became lost
only by their failure to assert it.

That's what has prevented us from degenerating
to the lower forms of beings. We may not always

exert our individuality when in a group to the“

extent that may be desirable, but in vital matters
we can not be led against ourbetter judgment into
somethingnot in keeping with ‘our nature.

Some may contend that this is a bad feature,
well, every miracle drug has its side effects and
even the best of serums may give the ailments in-
stead of guarding us from them. The risk is well
worth taking due to the satisfaction of one of our
basic needs.

No Help Needed

No one being complete within himself needs
the help of other people to perform certain deeds
for him. He must be able to cope with and success-
fully culminate business not only with the indi-
viduals he likes or admires but also with those
whom he dislikes and looks down upon. Belonging
to an organiatiozn places him in the situation
where he meets a great number of people with di-
vergent'attitudes and aptitudes on life.

Thisis the best training ground for individuals
to learn the lesson of.’ co-existence that can be
learned, and it must be learned by everyone wish-
ing for any measure of success, in life. If there

were more joiners all over the world perhaps there.

would be less conflict and strife to contend- with.

The group spirit often brings out the better side
of one’s nature and prompts unselﬁshness and to-
getherness among the members of the group. I

Belonging

By Viiay Jain

am not suggesting that just joining a group or or- ”
ganization will make you a "better person than you
are presently, one must be in the receptive mood
of give and take.

If somebody joins a club just for the sake of

having an impressive list of organizations to ac-’,__:

company his senior picture index, he is defeating:
the purpose of joining the group. To truly derive
the beneﬁts from the group, a certain amount of
sacriﬁces must be made and the thought process
must change from one of Self to that of Others.

Even willingness to adjust and a desire to join

an activity is in itself not enough. A particular
interest in the functions of the club must be enter-

tained, and it must be made sure that you can I

assimilate with other members of the group. Minor’
adjustments can and should be made, but no ideo-
logical barrier must exist between the fellow
members.

Can‘? Doubt Usefullness A

The usefullness of the club ‘must not be doubted,
one can not for instance consider that all social
fraternities and sorrorities are parasitic bureaucra-
cies attached to the ‘college and still hope- to be
a successful rushee.

,‘.._...w,.-

On the other hand, one who thinks the world? A

of his pseudo—inte1ligent group, can not be expected
to vote rationally on an issue close to the heart.
Thus proper values must be realized and estab-

lished if an activity is to remain just that and not '

one’s whole life.

It is often by overindulgence in the activities
of the favorite ‘group that one may become in-
ﬂuenced by the oﬁicial thinkingof the club.

Two heads are better_ than one, so "often a"; -..~,._

thought process formulated by your club may"
really appeal to you. I would adopt it and
make it a part of my own philosophy rather than
think of it as something alien to myself.

On the other hand I would under no circum-
stances accept a doctrine‘ no matter how-well sub-
scribed by others if I did not myself approve of it.

Often one is made ‘to feel that a compromise
must be made by the individual for the harmony
Within the society. My philosophy on the matter“
is that any organization that requires me to sacri-

'ﬁce any of my principals is not worthy belonging to.

One is better off without a selﬁsh organization and
with his principals intact.

Not everyone can be or is capable of being a
leader. It is.the'Indiansvthat’make the Chiefs im-
portant, the leader gets in a group to. match his‘
leadership abilities ‘with others and receives a
"chance tomake use of them. The latter in turn ob-
tain a lesson in respect‘ of authority and also some

opportunities’ to observe leadership, potential at:

close, quarters, and thus provide’ somepointers t

' the less aggressive. "

Jim O'Brien

Sports Editor

When a Pitt scout ‘is trying to lure a high school prospect
tofurther hislschooling on.the Oakland campus, he empha-
sizes the cultural advantages of the school. He stresses edu-
cation, education, education. .

Judging by these standards the Panther basketball team
must be the smartest in the country. They’re always learn-
ing. The Panther basketball team lost at home Monday night
to Northwestern, 57-55, with a team that is supposed to be
going somewhere.

Instead they ended up with the athletic department’s
coat of arms — a .500 mark.

But the game was not a complete loss. “We learned a
lot tonight,” said Coach Bob Timmons, quickly thumbing to’
page 23 of his shop-worn cliche booklet. '

Timmons has a team with five juniors that was sup-
posed to be learning last year as sophomores. That theoreti-
cally is the period of enlightenment for a college athlete.

If the Panthers were ﬁelding a team with all gradu-
ate students on the ﬂoor, they would still be learning.
Just what are they learning — how to lose and maintain

Northwestern was not a good club. A loss to them at
Evanstown, Illinois would be bad enough — yet excusable.
But they should have been appetizers at the Field House.

Timmon’s “best shooting club that I’ve -ever had
here” scored ﬁve ﬁeld goals in the first half. The Grimm
Brothers should have been in the line-up. They live in’
their own world, too.

Brian Generalovich, their captain, was caught sleeping
four times in the ﬁrst half as he had the ball stolen from
him four times while nonchalantly bringing the ball down-

Tim Grgurich forced shots and missed. Dave Sauer was
totally ineffective. Paul Kriger did some good rebounding
under the defensive boards, but little under his own. He
scored ﬁve points, not much for a 6-6 center.

Cal Sheffield hit three of twelve shots, the second
time this year that he has been that effective. from the
ﬁeld. He still thinks passes are what he gives his rela-
tives to come to the games. Defense—what’s that?

He has terriﬁc peripheral vision and it centers immedi-
ately around the rim of the hoop.

Dave Roman, the refreshing new recruit from Johns-
town College, was the only effective player. He scored 11
points and the crowd adopted him as their favorite.

And the crowd. For the second straight time they
swarmed into the Field House. They had 1721 at the Purdue
game and 934 at the Northwestern affair.
Duquesne on opening night by 700 and Monday by 200.

They responded to the cheerleaders and yelled like
Pitt students never did. They risked the right to keep
their namesake by pulling for a last-minute victory.

But the Panthers took turns choking at the foul line
with two minutes to go.’ They missed three of ﬁve free
throws, twice on the front endof bonus shot situations.

The Wildcat's coach Bill Rohr learned something, too.
“You won’t believe this,” he said. “But I was walking down
the street and ‘just happened to _pick up a Pitt News. I read
there that Pitt was using the ‘Auburn Shuffle.’ In my 20
years of coaching, I have never gone up against that.

-“So we worked with some coins on the carpet of our
hotel and set up some make-shift defenses. They worked
pretty well.” Learning is contagious.

They outdrew

‘Panthers Hope’

For Comeback

After lst Loss

By ART FLEISCHNER

The Panther Cagers will
travel .to Kent, Ohio tomor-
row to play the Golden
Flashes of Kent State. The
Panthers take a 1-1 record
against Kent’s 0-2 mark.

Coach Bob Do1l’s squad lost to
Syracuse, 36-35, and Duquesne,
62-50, immediately after Pitt
dropped a 57-55 decision to North-
western Monday.

Kent is in much the same situa-
tion as the Panthers: both teams
lack overall height.
will have to depend on 6’-6" sen-
ior center Don Werner who is
trying to fill the shoes of grad-
uated All-Mid-American Harvey
Hunt.

Doug Kramer, a 6’-7” junior is
expected to- start at one of the
forward positions. Kramer is built
much like Paul Krieger, and
should grab his share of rebounds.

Small Team

After these two players, there
is no one else on the squad over
6'-4”. The scoring ‘is done mostly
by a pair of swift backcourt men,
Ty Saunders and Denny Klug,
who also plays forward.

Saunders made some spec-
tacular driving lay-ups against

well. Klug, although only 9. jun-
ior, has been elected captain of,
the 1962-63 team. This stems
from his fine sophomore year
when he averaged 15 points a
gameand hit on 45 per cent of
his shots.

Poor Shooting

After the Northwestern game,
Coach Bob Doll stated that, “Ob-
viously Pitt had a poor shooting
night. I don't expect they’ll be
this cold when they come down on
Thursday evening.”

The Panthers had their cold-
est shooting night in the last
three years, hitting on only 25%
of their shots. Despite this
showing‘, -they still might have
won the game if they had con-
nected on more than 60 per cent
of their foul shots.

Foul shooting is usually the
Panthers strong point as evidenc-

The shot didn’t go in, however, and ‘it proved an omen

against Purdue. Against North-
western, however, Coach, Bob
Timmons boys could only manage
21 of 35.

The Wildcats attempted two less
foul throws. All together there
were 54 fouls called, the last one
cost Pittsburgh the game. With no
time remaining on the clock and
the score tied 55-55, forward Rick
Lopossa calmly swished both foul
shots, having previously made
only two of eight.

The team should be given credit
for overcoming a 15 point deﬁcit

tunities to win the game in the
closing minutes. -

She really has a way with a dish and, as you can see, she’s
