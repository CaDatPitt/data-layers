University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vol. 70, No. 47

Monday,“ January 26, I976  

 

BY BILL MOORE

A formal protest has been ﬁled
by unsuccessful Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) presidential
candidate Barry Weisband over the
alleged irregularities in two Stu-
dent Union voting machines.

Weisband, who lost by 32 votes
last week to Joe Gronsky, said he
has numerous witnesses who saw
one or both of the voting machines
in the S.U. Art Gallery with slips of

- E aper covering his name. “When
éégeople had the choice to vote for a

certain candidate, they did not

have the choice of voting for me,”
Weisband said yesterday.

“It is by no means a personal
attack on any of the candidates, but
I feel that the election was not as
equitable as it should have been,”
he said.

Gronsky issued a written state-
ment yesterday on the election
contest. “I would hope the
Elections Committee would keep
the best interests of the students in
mind while making a speedy and
just decision,” the statement said.

Gronsky took 641 votes of the
1,655 cast over Weisband’s 609.

tial sources that the Board would
be considering four units. '

For the ﬁrst time in the history of
the current Board, there was a
dissenting opinion to the majority
vote by Board chairman Ronald
Schieb. According to some sources
his dissent leaves the door open for
legal objections to the Thursday
decision.

Next in step for the three unions
moving for the right to represent
Pitt faculty is the pre-election
conference ordered for Friday at 11
a.m. Downtown. The -parties will
discuss and hammer out election

 

 
 

procedures such as the positioning
of polling ‘places, as well as setting
the date for the vote. '

So far that date has been set back
until sometime in March because of
repeated delays by’ the Board in

rendering a ﬁnal decision, accord-
ing to some sources.

The three unions vying to lock up
the University are the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP), the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU), and the Pennsylvania
State Education, - Association
(PSEA).

"The reaction from unionleaders
was mixed. According to PPU
president Van Beck Hall the overall
decision was excellent although
there was some disappointment
that the Board did not make a
ruling on the PPU’s case for
graduate students pending litiga-
tion of a similar case at the Albert
Einstein Institute.

AAUP president Seth Spaulding
said he felt the ruling that excludes
chairmen from the bargaining units.
in the Provost’s area. would be
detrimental to Pitt under collective
bargaining. He noted the AAUP
plans to ﬁle objections to this and
other rulings after the elections are
held. . on - ’

decision ignored faculty wishes to

Third-place candidate Larry Cha-

candidate Mark Satinoff (175 votes)
said they would participate in a
new election if the Student
Government‘ Elections Committee
(SGEC) orders one.

Weisband is asking for a new
election, he said, “because that is
the only way the problem can be
resolved. Since there was such a
slim margin, I feel the outcome
could have been different if the
irregularities hadn't existed.’ ’

$ I Football Tickets Approved A  

BY BILL MOORE

A $1-per-game charge for Pitt

students attending I -home football’

games, with a 20% reduction for

__ season tickets, was approved

Friday at a . meeting, of the
Chancellor's ad hoc Committee on
Ticket Distribution. '

The motion passed, 5-3, with
four abstentions, at the end of a
two-hour discussion by the Com-

CAS Board A
Agrees on

sos Credit

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

A new procedure for students '

transferring from the School of
General Studies (SGS) to CAS was
passed Friday by the CAS Council.
The change came at the request
of SGS Director of Student Affairs
Daniel Obara, who reported that
the inconsistencies in transfer
procedure are causing unnecessary
inconveniences for SGS students.
Under the old system, instituted
by former CAS Dean Jerome
Schneewind, students with 60 or
more credits and atleast a 2.0 QPA
in‘ General Studies could auto-
matically transfer ‘to ’ CAS.
Students with 18-59 credits and at
least a 3.0 QPA had to apply
through the Admissions Ofﬁce.

The new guidelines will allow all '

transfers to be processed through
the CAS Office. A 2.5 QPA would
be required for acceptance for
people with 18-59 credits, while the
requirements forstudents with 60
or more credits would remain the
same. .

Obara originally wanted auto-
matic transfer for SGS students
with 30 or -more credits.

’ “I think that if he (an SGS
student) earns 30 credits in General
Studies, that merits consideration

for transferring to CAS,’--’ Obara‘,

said. 7 .. .
.However, Dean of Admissions"

and Aid Kenneth Wenger objected:

Forum Blasts Senate“
Bill I As Dangerous 

BY SUSAN MAPINELLA

Speakers at a public forum on
Senate Bill 1 in Benedum Auditor-
ium Friday night denounced the
measure as the most dangerous
legislation under consideration by
federal legislators.

Esther Hearst, coordinator of the
Washington, D.C., office of the
National Committee Against Re-
pressive Legislation, said “S. 1
represents all that is vengeful in
our criminal justice system.”

Known as the Criminal Justice
Act of 1975, S. 1 is an attempt. to
recodify title 18 of the , U.S.
Criminal Code—that section of
federal law dealing with ‘criminal
offenses and procedures. ' The
present Criminal Code was last

updated in 1909.

S. 1, which represents nearly 10
years of ‘hearings and legislative
studies, is more than 750 pages
long, the longest piece of legisla-
tion ever-considered. It is now
before the full Senate Judiciary
Committee.

In her 20-minute talk, Hearst
presented a history of the bill,
explaining that a National Commis-

sion on Reform of Criminal ‘Laws,

ﬁrst reported to President.Lyndon
Johnson in 1966’ that the U.S.
Criminal Code should be studied
and revised.

A commission headed bylformer-V

California Gov. Pat Brown submit-
ted the results -of its study to
President Richard ._Nixon and

 

JOE GRONSKY

Athletic Committee student mem-
ber Jim Gervase argued. ‘

“I agree it is too much- hassle,’-’ '»
Doerfler said. “I disagree with the. i ‘
whole refund system because I" 
don’t think it is necessary, because ,. -. 
I don’t think it is necessary to pay" *

for tickets.” ‘

Part ofthe reason stated 'by‘th"e
committee for charging students"
was so a deﬁnite commitment.‘
would be made on the part of: g 
students, allowing the athletics ‘» 
department to estimate more‘.

DEATH PENALTY REVIEWED

WASHINGTON (AP)—The

yesterday for a broad review of
capital punishment laws enacted
since the court’s 1972 decision
declaring previous capital punish-
. ent laws unconstitutional.
I _§_!‘he court announced it would
hear arguments March 30 and 31
on the appeal of six men, both
black and white, sentenced to
death for committing murder in
Georgia, Texas, North Carolina,
Florida and Louisiana.

The justices are expected to
decide during the current term
whether the new laws enacted in
those states are constitutional.
This means a decision probably
would be reached by late June.

certain conditions, ‘ for increased
sentences for _‘specially dangerous
offenders, conspiracy or repeated
crime," and for high maximum
penalties.

“Sentencing increases the gross
inequities we already see in our

-system because of different judges,‘
different parts of the country and’

the racial or economic status of
defendants,” Hearst said. “All
these things seem to put the
offender in the position not of
serving time for his own offense,
but for serving as a ‘lesson’ for
society."

James Miller, a Washington
lobbyist for the American Civil
Liberties Union, spoke about a
portion of the act that has drawn
the most criticism——section 1121.

Opponents charge it would
become an Ofﬁcial Secrets Act,
limiting what citizens can learn
about government policies through

_ such offenses as disclosing national

defense information and other
classified information. '

  

 

“The problem with this bill is
definitional,” Miller explained.
“National defense information
could be used to mean anything at
all——in terms of the bill—‘pertain-
ing to military capabilities of the
U.S.’ ”

Although Miller criticized_S.1, he
agreed the federal code needs to be
rewritten because it is obsolete.

“The bill is virtually unamen-
dable, considering the political
makeup of the Senate Judiciary

Committee—seven liberals and-

eight conservatives," Miller said.

“The worst parts of it will be
modiﬁed to meet current law, but it
won’t be good.‘ The most you’ll get
are half-assed compromises.”

The ﬁnal speaker in the forum
was Naisha, a Pitt political science
graduate and a. member of the
Pittsburgh Coalition to Stop Senate
Bill 1.

Naisha charged that “S.l is a
threat to all people,” but especially
to minorities. and maintained that
“only the rich who already control
power in this country will not be
detrimentally affected by S.1.”

Despite that half the committee seats are held by students, a 5-3 vote
with four abstentions was pulled off in favor of a pay system. There .

It should be pointed out, however, that Resident Student Association

Story as Rocist

The Pitt News should not print
articles so foolish and offensive as
Gene Grabowski’s Jan. 12 attack
upon football players. It is
shocking that any University
newspaper can permit such de-
scriptions of students to appear as:
“big hulks," “young brutes,”
“lummoxes,” and those who “play
brutal and offtimes idiotic sports."
Such language treats athletes as
subhuma'ns——athletes whom hun-
dreds of thousandsof students and
other’ people applaud every week-
end. It is. quite frankly, the same
kind of language that fascist—m,ind-
ed people have always used.

lt is disgusting to apply such
terms to anyone. but when, one
considers that many football
players are black, the use of such

 

terms also becomes racist. The
cartoon accompanying the article
was no better, depicting an
oversized “hulk” writing the
alphabet, with beer cans strewn
around him on the floor.

Grabowski’s characterization of
nonathletes at Pitt as, “the more
literate sector of Pitt's student
body" is also questionable, as is
his complaint about “the depreca-

tion (athletes) have_shed’ on‘ our’

hard-earned diplomas. ’ ’ \

,I don’t know how Grabowski
forms his opinions. I teach
between 200 and 250 students each
term, including members of the
football and other athletic teams. I
have noticed no such division
between the intellectual abilities of
athletes and nonathletes. There
are good and not-so-good students
in both categories. Grabowski
certainly cannot be so naive as to
believe-all nonathletes are highly
literate and hard working! (I even
suspect that many nonathletes can
match the alleged beer-drinking
capacities of athletes.)

Finally, it ‘is true’ that many
athletes do receive special tutoring;
I suppose this is why Grabowski
needs to “feel jealous of athletes
because of their special treat-
ment." But ratherthan implying
that such tutoring services should
be denied to athletes, it would be
more constructive to propose they

of these premises. One is ‘that

student leaders must work in a
vacuum, only occasionally getting
aid from a student organization.
But even more important is that
these leaders have failed to realize
that the student body's only
strength is not in “civilized”
negotiation, but in the vast
potential of students for disrupting
the normal processes. of the
University.

Let's get more speciﬁc. The only
signiﬁcant issue that students have
won in the last three years was the
Time Schedule fee of 1974. Though

. this was worked out mostly by the

normal “coffee break” negotia-
tions, there was another signiﬁcant
factor, student a_wareness of the
issue. » ’

Everyone«was angry with the
administration. Student organiza-
tions wrotevletters, and The Pitt
News fervently cruciﬁed those
behind the fee. The pressure had
to be felt, and when a face-saving
opportunity arose; the administra-
tion took it.

The lesson here is not that
negotiations work, but that ad-
ministrators are sensitive to the
mood of the students, when that
mood hits them with a forceful
enough impact. '

What this means to our new
Student Government is this: our
student leaders will have to do
whatever is necessary to make the
administration aware of the stu-
dents’ mood‘. And considering the

‘growing unresponsiveness tc

negotiation, thatmeans mass
action in the form of demonstra-
tions and sit-ins. »

The very mention of mass action
or radical politics makes many
shrink back, in horror,,because it
seems an unnatural thing for the
academic and pseudo-sophisticated
atmosphere of the University. '
Students should study, not strike.
But the unfortunate reality is that

~most student attempts at sophisti-

cation are mirthfully tolerated and
ignored.

Sure, students sit. on Senate
committees and the CAS Council,

tors have to realize is that
demonstrations are as natural to
students as strikes are to labor.

Strikes and the threat of strikes
are the only things that force
management to the bargaining
table. Subsequently, mass action
is the only means students have to
make sure administrators bargain

‘in good faith. The prime example

is last year's controversy over the
chairmanshin of the black studies
department.

The Black Action Society (BAS)__
was consistently denied its legi?  pf,

mate voice in the selection of a
black studies chairman until a
group of 30 or 40 students went to
the chancellor's office and refused
to move until they were dealt with.
The effect of this move is clear,’
because their candidate is now
chairman of the black studies
department.

Our new student leaders must
realize now what the importance of.
well-organized demonstrations can
be. They should begin cultivating
student awareness and involve-
ment this week, even beforethey
get into office. Perhaps sm'4l1_
rallies could be organized arouﬁ
the tuitibn issue, which is sure toﬂ

reappear this year. V The turnout .

may be small at ﬁrst, but if the
2,000 letters of last year’s

START-UP campaign can be .

transformed into 1,000 demonstra-
tors, the net effect would be much
greater. ’ . .

Many“ probably ' will dismiss
these suggestions as those of either
a crank or a senior who has nothing
to lose by popping off. The grim’
reality however, is that nothing
gets done unless someone makes it
happen, and the bureaucratic route
on longer works, if it ever did at all.

A

Letter to the editor

During the next few weeks, the
faculty will be called on to decide
whether it wishes to be represented
by a collective bargaining agent.
The outcome of the elections may
mark a turning point in the quality
of education at Pitt and in our
individual freedom to follow your
academic calling. I believe consid-
erably more will be lost than
gained by unionizing at this time
and urge my colleagues on the
faculty to vote for no agent.
During the past year, we have
received a series of mailings from
. he various organizations which
/hfould like to negotiate for us. They
are supported by some of our fellow
facultymembers who have dedica-
ted many hours to the publicity
campaigns and to hearings before

. the PLRB. It is clear that there are

I

n-

also strongly vested interests in
the outside organizations which
would like to be our spokesman. It
should also be clear that a price will
be paid in self-determination in
returnfor the admitted power of
the collective bargaining agents.
Perhaps we are at a point where the
services of a new bureaucracy are
needed to manage our affairs on
this campus—I do not believe so.
Labor negotiations are conducted
\within a legal adversary system

,f“"§£hich must inevitably polarize the 

vfjampus and institutionalize separ-
ation and distrust between the
faculty, administraiton and stu-
dents. Unionization of faculties is
based on the familiar industrial
labor model where administrators
are “management,” students are
“comsumers” and teachers are the
“labor force.” Its ultimate threat is
collective action in the form of the
strike through which the faculty
declares a moratorium on its
academic commitment to its
students until the union's demands
are met. Those failing to support
the strike vote would be ,barred
._ ‘m their classrooms, laboratories

and offices until their agent had.

negotiated an acceptable deal. Will
we come to that?

Obviously a major question is the
effect of unionization on the quality
of our institution. “Quality”
applies to several factors in our
lives as teachers. Surely, it refers
to excellence to which all of us and
our students hopefully aspire. Far

beyond that, itdeals with many-

elements of education which are
not ultimately quantiﬁable. As
such, quality often. presents a
frustrating limit on the perceptions
of those who think strictly in. terms
of counting things such as

 

,,,-egblications‘, dollars, teaching
‘hours, days of sick leave, years of
seniority, etc—precisely those
terms-negotiated in labor contracts.
The bureaucratic agent deals in
such terms because he cannot
negotiate those factors of attitude,
perception, dedication and integ-
rity which are part of the
qualitative atmosphere of a fine
educational institution.

I believe unionization/‘must
inevitably and irreversibly commit
our University ' to the further
encroachment of the completely
quantitative evaluations which we

    

 

already find so offensive in our
dealings with the state legislature
and some components of the
University administration. If we

‘resort to “fighting bureaucracy

with bureaucracy," we will be the
victims of our own weakness and
lack of commitment to those
qualities which we most value in
our calling and which we most wish
to transmit to our students. Only
the community ‘of scholars can
appreciate and defend the peculiar
combination of sensitivity and

‘tough-mindedness, of individual-
ism and collegiality, of austerity

and open-handedness which fos-
ters the climate of genuin
academic endeavor. '
We doubt if anyone within the
contending bargaining organiza-
tions will openly espouse a position
contrary to the improvement of
education at Pitt. Yet it should be
obvious that the involvement of
union stewards in faculty recruit-
ment and promotion along with the
steady accretion of new procedures
generated by negotiated settle-

Stand for No Faculty Union

ments will further hamper the

"already complicated process of,

faculty development.

Undoubtedly the professional
staffs who have prepared the
expensive, promotional literature
mailed tous can raise arguments to
rebut the separate issues I raise
here. This is their ‘livelihood and
they are well supported by union
dues. Those of us who are
independent and want to stay that
way have had no officially
recognized voice in the proceedings
up to now. I believe that the time
has come for us to speak up or lose

our position ‘by default. We cannot '
rely on, the administration or ,

trustees to fight our battles, even if
they all could see things our way.
A careful examination of. Public
Law 195, under which the
conditions of collective bargaining
in Pennsylvania are defined,
should dispel some of the notions
regarding governance that are
suggested by recent mailings from
would-be bargaining agents. Under
its conditions, the faculty’s voice in

Monday, January 26‘,_1V9.7’6—THE‘PI'I".17 Newsgizdgéis ,  

many matters of vital concern
would be even less than it is now
and the rights of “management”
ﬁrmly established and enforced.

One need look no further than’

the Pittsburgh school strike to see
that not all matters of concern to
teachers /are bargainable under
state law. There is no assurance
that many of the grievances aired
by recent union mailings would be
any more negotiable under Law 195
than they are now within the
present shaky framework of “col-
legiality” at Pitt.

The basic questions cannot be
answered simply in ideological

"terms of being pro- or anti—union or-

of being “liberal” or “conser-
vative.” The real issue is whether
we, the faculty of the University of
Pittsburgh, really need a union at
this time. Clearly, it will not be
hard to get collective bargaining if
we are driven to it by the
administraiton, trustees or state
legislature. Once we have a union,

it will be virtually impossible to get -

rid of it.

The essential questions to be
asked regarding the establishment
of collective bargaining under P.L.
195 at Pitt in the coming year are
the following:

.- 1. Will it really make our campus a‘ 5 ‘ I

better place in which to teach and
to learn?

2'. Will it really help our students to
get a better education for their-
hard-earned tuition dollars?

3. Will it really provide better
protection for capable junior faculty
or will it expose them (as it has
elsewhere) to retrenchment under
last hired-first ﬁred seniority rules?

4. Will it enforce or dilute our '

aspirations for building a great
university?

I strongly urge my,colleague’s to/'
informthemselves as objectively as
possible on the basic pros and cons
of the momentous decison which
faces us. The issues are not
one—sided. I do not see many real
fools or rascals in any of the
contending camps. However. for

my part, I believe strongly that
carefully '

when the facts are
weighed we will lose far more than
we will gain—as faculty, as
students, as a community—by
unionizing at this time.

accurately student attendance, so it
could sell or distribute the unused
portion of student seating.

“The problem with the payment
program is that it doesn’t meet its
goal," newly elected SGB member
Larry Krain said. “It isn’t a very
serious commitment because of the
low cost. but if you raise the cost,

you would be limiting who could,

attend.”

“You can make a commitment in
many ways—by money or by
time,” student Ezra Krieg said,
arguing for »a return to the
first-come, first-served method
used in past years. “I’ve been
going to gamesfor three years
now, and there has never been a
problem.”

Gervase also differed with Krieg,
claiming the long lines were an
inconvenience to students. “We
missed classes, labs and spent the
whole day in line,’ he said. “The
reason I'm for a pay system is that
the students I talk to say they
would rather pay than go through

all that and— then be closed out.”

Committee Chairman Dr. Ken-
neth Metz also opposed a return to
the former system. “What we are
also faced with is the ethics of
setting aside 10,000 student seats
and having a large number of them
left empty,” he said.

Former Interfraternity Council
President Ed Riefenstahl made a
motion to hold the season ticket
cost down to $3, but that was voted
down by all but Riefenstahl,

Gronsky and Doerfler.

The motion approved by the
committee would set season ticket
costs at $4 for a five-game season
and $4.80 for six games.

The committee will meet again
today at 3 p.m. in 119 S.U. to
discuss how the money generated
from ticket sales will be used.

bers include funding bus trips to

While working at Mellon Bank

he could attend college on a

two weeks after enrolling at Robert

became ill and was diagnosed as
having Hodgkin’s disease.

Because the Leskos had two

In a ﬁeld of 39 couples, none
lasted ‘the full 36 hours of the
marathon. Couple No. 1, Mill-
dridge Harris and Phyllis Wood-
ard, were the only ones left on the
floor after 32 hours and were
declared the winners. ‘

“We outdanced‘ everybody,_”

Woodard said. “On Saturday night
around 11 or 12 o’clock, everyone
slowed down, but we were still

The contributions of money and
prizes that the committee did
receive from local businesses

keep the couples dancing and to
raise the money for Easter Seals.

With six shifts of‘ referees to

Rest periods were conﬁned to three

“I was very upset at the apathy
of the different ‘organizations,

“We sought their support for the

work was done by ﬁve people on

Two people who weren’t upset

“Well, I was only gone for an
hour or two——and when I came
back—look, you can see for
yourself,” he explained to the two
policemen.

Before he left his room in Tower
A, he had a brand new Panasonic
stereo-Land a portable television.
His roommate had been the proud
owner of a Hewlett Packard 135.

He didn’t have any insurance,
and his parents’ insurance hadn't
paid enough for him to replace
what had been stolen.

This didn't happen. But it could
be any student living in University
housing or in an apartment. No
one expects to be robbed, and
when it happens and the student
doesn’t have insurance, it’s often
hard to replace what was lost.

The Ofﬁce of Residence Life has
been aware of‘ this problem for a
long time and has‘ found an
insurance policy for renters,
according to Assistant Director Jo
Ann Woodson Gibbs.

Gibbs explained some students
are covered by their parents’
insurance, but those who aren’t
covered are'in trouble when it
comes to replacing stolen property.

“After doing a survey of
universities all over the country, we
ﬁnally found a renters’ insurance
policy that is being used at the
University of Pennsylvania,” Gibbs
said. '

The policy has two plans, an
on-campus plan for students in
residence halls or other University-
owned or University-approved
housing, and a plan for students in
single-family dwellings or apart-
ment houses. ‘

The on-campus. plan gives $1,500
of coverage for $20 per year, with

able up to $5,000. The off-campus
plan provides the same coverage
for $30 per year.

The policy covers clothing,
televisions, radios. stereo equip-
ment, cameras and calculators-
and other property a student is
likely to. own.

University attorney Alden Bowen
said the policy is legally sound and
suggested it would be worthwhile
for students without coverage

under their parents’ insurance.
“It is analagous to a homeown-...E f_

er’s policy for apartment renters,"
Bowen explained. A

Bowen advised students to check
the liability limits of their parents’
insurance to ﬁnd if the renters’
policy would be beneficial for them.

Nationwide, students’ lose up to
$40 million in personalproperty
every year—and $25 million of
these loses are uninsured. So, if
you live in the residence halls, or
off campus in an apartment or a
fraternity house, check with the
Office of Residence life for
information about the renters‘
insurance policy.

Best and Worst

hr A. IRENE SCHMIDT

It was the best of ballet, it was
the worst of ballet. It was a repeat
from, two months ago at Syria

’Mosque, it was a worldpremiere. It

was a triumph and a resounding

, ﬂop.

The four short ballets presented
by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
this past weekend touched all
possible extremes: in quality, in
style and mood. It was fortunate

5 f. ’_ that generally, the best was left for

last.
The Ballet Theatre’s world
premiere of Steel Symphony was

"right in line, as far as Bicentennial

projects go—it was totally off-base.

     

Notwithstanding the program’s

' grandiose explanations, this at-

tempt at ballet misﬁred, as far‘ as
the audience was concerned.

The choreography for Steel-
Symphony was done by Nicolas

'  Petrov, founderand artistic direc-

tor of the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre. Somehow, he managed to
‘miss the point through the ‘entire
ballet. The image conveyed was
more Space 1999 than Pittsburgh
steel’ mills, even though the
program insisted “...there_ %,11'¢
ﬂashes of realistic actions and
situations which the Pittsburgh
audience, especially steelworkers

will recognize. _
- To symbolize metal, the principal

__ dancers’ were dressed in tight-

ﬁtting silvery jumpsuits and hoods.
For TV babies, that meant they
were people from a far away galaxy
encountered in Star Trek. '
Irrelevant as the choreography

"seemed, lighting and special

effects, such as a metallic orchestra
playing on stage, in full view of the
_audience a giant “thunder mach-
ine,” and films projecting glowing

  

‘had been erased.

 

orange and yellow balls onto the
backdrop were interesting and
produced an engrossing atmos-
phere of turbulent movement.

 

The discontinuity which was so
predominant in Steel Symphony
was one of the major problems of
the second ballet, Winterset, when
it was first performed by the Ballet
Theatre in the Syria Mosque, in
November.

The past weekend’s performan-
ces showed signiﬁcant improve-
ment in the ﬂow of this dramatic
ballet. The ballet still needed the
plot explanation in the program,
but much of the roughness which
marred the November performance

were more conﬁdent in their
characterizations, a feeling which
awakened a necessary trust in the
audience.

It’s a shame that the Ballet
Theatre didn’t take the laughter
which greeted the melodrama in
the November performance to
heart. Three characters still die
through pistol cracks so loud they
badly shocked the audience. It
would seem the choreographer
might have considered the previous
reaction and substituted the drama

The dancers "

 Bal|etRepeats & Premieres

the sudden and alarming pistol
shots. The same blindness applies
to a, set change which was
accomplished in the middle of a
scene, by pulling the skeleton of a
house across the stage and letting
two dancers leap through the door.
Once again the reaction" was
laughter, and the Ballet Theatre
had only itself to blame. That’s
called not learning from your
mistakes.

However, the moments of

unadulterated melodrama were not
severe enough to destroy the
touching dance of thetwo young
lovers, portrayed by JoAnn Mc-
Carthy and Gregory Begley. As in
November, it was’ their skill in

 

conveying a number of conﬂicting
feelings through their pas de deux

‘which wrung more than the usual

polite applause from the audience.
Returning to the classical, the
third ballet of the evening featured

McGarrigIe Sisters

Making Music Waves

BY TOM WASELESKI

Kate & Anna McGarrigle,
Kate and Anna McGarrigle.
Warner Brothers Records
BS 2862.

You’ve heard them before. On
Linda Ronstadt’s Heart Like :1
Wheel and Prisoner in ‘Disguise.
On Maria Muldaur’s Waitress in a
Donut Shop.

They’re a pair of songwriting
sisters who've been making slow
but steady headway in the music
world since the beginning of the
seventies.

This is their first album together,
and one that is bound to make some
big waves.

If not for the big numbers
they've writtern for other artists,
then at least for the stark freshness
that abound herein. the Sisters
McGarrigle could very well be the
next telling force on rock music.

Their arrangements are a unique
mix of sixties folk, Depression
blues, French chanson, and Gersh-
win.

Alone, their voices are at best
common. But interwoven as they
most often are, they have a certain

power—vivacious,. reeling, some-

times lamenting.

There’s not a bad song on the
record; the sisters have a sixth
sense for harmony, having been
steeped in music by two musical
parents. While tough to pick the
best cut on the album, one thing
about the better tunes is that they
end up being the most intricate,
which I guess is no surprise since

they sound better as a duet than as_

solos.

' The ﬁrst slice, “Kiss and Say
Goodbye," is as close to main-
stream rock as they’ll get. Carried
by a rollicking piano and heavy sax,
Kate’s lead strongly resembles
Maria Muldaur.

Anna understandably does her
own “Heart Like a Wheel” with
even more feeling than Ronstadt.
With little more than a lonely
banjo, a distant organ, and some
backup vocals just for thickness,

Poor Taste

BY JEFF DUNMIRE

. Instead of starting 30 minutes '

late, the show should have been
cancelled. Some of the absurd
remarks shouted from the audience
while we waited for the “movie” to
start were some of the nicest things
heard for the next few hours.
Those who were foolish enough to
stand in line from the front of the

Saturday night know I’m referring

Q.

 

BY CHARLES W. OGG

“If the aim of the teacher strike
were simply an increase in salary,
the strike would be over now,” said
Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers

(PFT) mcmhcr Fred Eberling
during a teach-in last. week at
David lrmrcm-c Hall in support of

the teachers‘ strike.
“We are primarily concerned
with the quality of education within

the public school system,” Eber-'

ling claimed. He faulted the school
board and the news media for their

alleged avoidance of this issue in '

public debate.

“The present class size allow-
able by contract is 28, plus or
minus six. The PFT supports this,”
Eberling said. “The Board wishes
to increase the size to 38, plus or
minus six. How can you accomplish
anything in a class of 44. The Board-
would have you believe size has
little to do with quality,” Eberling
said. A V

He also cited differences of
opinion regarding job security,
alluding to possible cutbacks in
such areas as specialized reading
programs, music, sports and
foreign languages. ’

The PFT also is ﬁghting to stop_
proposed cutbacks in the number of
counselors. The response by
Common Pleas Judge Donald
Ziegler to such demands has been
to call them a “smokescreen,”
according to Eberling. S

The people . at_ the teach-in,
numbering approximately 40-50,
generally reacted favorably to
Eberling and the other speakers.
The group was a fairly even
mixture of teachers and students.

One person challenged the
teachers on the grounds they were
not always acting in the best

interests of the students. He gave '

as an example the support of tactics
such as paddling.

While Eberling claimed this was

necessary, he also pointed out that

the Board had not allowed any
other form of discipline to be
carried out effectively.

“The board's sole effort has
been to break this union, not
negotiate," Eberling said. “They
could have spent this time going to
the state for money, if that is truly a
problem." Eberling was unsure of
exactly how much money there is
and criticized the present system,
which. he said, makes the disposal
of public funds impossible for the
public to follow.

Joe White, a history professor at
Pitt and treasurer of the Pitt
Professional Union, a campus-con-
stituted group that supports the
PFT, pointed out that if the strike
fails, many Pitt graduates who go
to work in the public sector will be
affected. ‘

“A victory for workers in one
sector affects the strength of
workers in all their struggles,"
White said. He also stressed that
the outcome of this strike will affect
education for years to come, having
such possible repercussions as an
increase in the University tuition
level.

Jose Moreno, a sociology profes-
sor at Pitt and the father of a
school-age child, claimed the main

issue is the priorities with which"

the public chooses to spend its tax
money. ‘ _

“We cannot live with poor
education, and the single most
important thing in the school
system is teachers,” Moreno said.

Against a degenerate and
continually cavorting crowd 'of
sailors, bar girls, burns and other
street people dressed in Western
costumes. the dancing of JoAnn
McCarthy as Frankie and Thierry
Dorado as Johnny was fluid and
wonderfully vulgar. Every gesture
was an innuendo.

In addition to the great charac-
terizations of the leads and a
rotund bartender who leaked, the
news about Johnny and Nellie Bly,
the humor with which the entire
company treated the melodrama of
the ballet was unexpectedly re-
freshing. It was a new light on the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, and a
very ﬂattering one.

It was an uneven slate for the
Ballet Theatre last Friday, but the_
ending was upbeat. Perfection
may bedancing on. the horizon.

niversity of Pittsburgh

As you may already know, the Pennsylvania. LaborRelations Board C
(PLRB) has ordered an election for the University of Pittsburgh faculty and in ’

so doing, the PLRB has excludedthe non-professional teaching staff, except
for research’ associates, from the faculty unit.

a ’ . From the very beginning, it wasgthe position of PSEA/NEA-PITT that
professional staff employees should be included in any appropriate faculty
unit. But the Labor Board's action of Thursday, January 22, 1976, effectively
precludes non-teaching professional employees, except research associates,
from voting in the faculty election. L

Because we believe that professional staffemployees at the University
want collective bargaining, and because PSEA/NEA-PITT made a commitment
to you, wehave, today, filed a petitionwith the University of Pittsburgh and
the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board asking for a separate electionffor
professional staff employees.   . .

dropped the ball softly through

Pantherettes
Sink Ohio St.

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The undefeated Pantherette
swimming team carried off its
fourth straight victory without the
efforts of two of its top swimmers.
Jennifer Price and Kathy Stetler,
who were both out with shoulder
tendonitis, as it sunk Ohio State on
Saturday, 81-50.

The gap was filled by a
sensational performance by Jamie

‘ Conley, who took first in individual

medley, 100-fly, and 500-freestyle,
and joined Christy Elston, Angie
Lopez and Sharon Riehsdorf for a
Pitt victory in the medley relay.

Pitt also took first place in the
200-yard freestyle and 100-yard
back stroke. Lopez had the top spot
in both the 50- and 100-yard,
breaststrokes.

“I thought the kids would come
through," Pitt coach Kate Mathi-
son said. “It gave-our second and
third people a_ chance to swim and
they pulled through well. It proves
everyone contributes to this team.”

Mathison had praise for Conley.

“Jamie is a versatile swimmer;
she can do distance and medleys,
she's an all-around swimmer.
She's on the verge of qualifying for
Easterns for three events," Mathi-
son said.

The other Pitt swimmers invited
to Easterns are Elston, Price,
Stetler, Lopez. Riehsdorf, Nila de
Jesus, Jennifer Brooker and
Connie Hiester.

The Pantherettes’ next competi- -

tion is tomorrow at 7 p.m. when
they take on Clarion, followed by
next Saturday's outing at Bowling
Green. The Clarion contest could

Pin Bloomsburg Foes

BY JIM LEWIS

It would have made a great
Schick razor blade commercial.

Bloomsburg State, in barber-like
fashion, lathered up the Pitt
wrestling team, sharpened its
razors and- gave the Panthers a
close shave.

Surviving the nicks and cuts, Pitt

‘ managed to pull out a super-close

20-19 victory over upset-minded

' Bloomsburg.

Bloomsburg (now 0-4 in the

Eastern Wrestling League)" had
nothing to lose and everything to
gain in beating Pitt—and almost
pulled it off. ‘
A “They (Bloomsburg) wrestled a
very good match,” said Head
Coach Dave Adams. “But we were
rather flat—we had some guys out
of the lineup. We were not near the
level we can wrestle."

Injuries did affect the lineup;
George O’Korn and Rande Stottle-
myer were out of the starting
i‘otatioii. But, surprisingly, Pitt still
had enough to topple State.

. “That’s a tribute to our team,"
Adams said. “Despite the injuries,
we still were able to beat them.”

For a moment there, it looked
like it would be a long afternoon for
the Panthers. After Kevin -Nellis
defeated Bloomsburg’s Dave Mc-
Callum, 8-0, State took the next two
matches and the lead. That is, until
"Pitt's granite-like strength dulled
Bloomsburg's blades.

Bob Bailey, Bill Korth, Skip
Bolin and Ray Dallatore downed
their opponents in consecutive
matches to put Pitt in the driver’s

seat for good. After} a slight surge .

by down-but-never-out Blooms-
burg, Bill Bailey decisioned State’s
Brian Weigle, 11-3, to put the Pan-

thers ahead by seven points and

clinch Pitt’s 10th victory in 11 tries.

Adams had a.lot of credit to
spread concerning the win.

“Kevin Nellis did a ﬁne job,” he
said, “and Bill Korth had a big win
for us (7-0 over Rich Rousa). Skip
Bolin came back to win (10-5 over
Dan Lechner), and. of course, Bill

Bailey clinched the meet with his’
win."

The victory gave Pitt a 2-0 record
in the tough Eastern Wrestling
League. A 7

Pitt’s next match is at home on
Saturday against Millersville State.

‘‘I think Millersville is unde-

_ feated," Adams said. “They beat

Indiana (Pa.) this season. I think if
the fans come out to the ‘have’
matches, they'd like what they
see."

Pitt waliops owls; Rutgers Nexttri

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

As the Pitt basketball players
look forward to winning their next
11 games, it behooves them to
remember that the next team ‘on
the Panther schedule is Rutgers, a
15-0 squad, and one "bent on
revenge for the three straight
losses it has suffered at the hands
of the Pittsburgh team.

Not only is Rutgers undefeated,
but the Scarlet Knights happen to
be ranked seventh in the country.

Although the Panthers should
have a rough time of it, there is no
reason to count Pitt out of the
game. The ‘Cats played tremen-
dous ball against No. 2 Marquette
and nearly pulled off an upset in
Milwaukee.

The Pitt team is definitely
capable. of winning, but there are a
number of things the players must
do accomplish that goal.

First, they must stop Phil
Sellers. If you thought Adrian,
Dantley was something, wait until
you see this man. The 6-5
All-American senior forward is one
of the bestcollege players today,
and to the residents of New
Brunswick, New Jersey, he is the
best. Sellers can shoot from almost
anywhere and score, grab re-
bounds galore and bend steel with
his bare hands. ,

Second, the Panthers, will have
to contain high-scoring 6-4 guard
Mike Dabney. He and Sellers
remember the three losses to Pitt,
especially last season's overtime
contest at ‘the Field House.

«Also, Pitt must learn to work for
good scoring opportunities. The
Cats have been -inconsistent in

Gym Teams Beatenii 1

» Both Pitt gymnastics teams
were clawed by Temple Saturday
afternoon; the Pantherettes were
edged, 89.95 to 89.0, and the injury
riddled men’s team was crushed,

192.3 to 141.2.

The Pantherettes, now 1-2 on the
season, enjoyed a slight lead until
the ﬁnal ﬂoor competition, and
easily could have won the match if
not for Temple’s Roxanne Pierce.

Pierce, who competed in the Pan
Am Games in 1971, was a member
of the U.S. Olympic team in 1972
and probably will compete again
this summer._

She compiled 8.9 points for beam
competition and 9.4 on the floor,
and single-handedly brought in
more than a third of Temple’s point
total. Her dazzling performance
almost completely overshadowed
an excellent effort by Pitt’s Cyndee
Severyn.

Severyn, in her best performance
of the young season, ﬁnished
second only to Pierce with 7.75
points on the beam and 8.25 from
the floor.

“Roxanne won the meet for
them,” Pitt Coach Donna DeMa-
rino said. “We really have a much
stronger team than Temple.”

Despite two straight losses, (the
other was against Kent State
Thursday night) DeMarino has
much cause for optimism. The
Pantherettes have improved 10
points in one week and the
remaining three injured athletes
will be back in action tomorrow at 7
p.m. when Clarion comes to town. I
Also, there is a good chance of
increased point production for
Severyn.

“Cyndee has her routines down .

solid,” DeMarion said. “Now,
we're going to put some riskier
moves in her routine, so her point
total should go tip.”

The possibility of an inﬂated
score is very welcome to the Pitt
team. Clarion, one of the top ﬁve
teams in the country, has a strong
lineup, including two All-Ameri-
cans. '

started ,to turn it around after“ " I

Thursday’s match. We had some
meetings on how to set up workouts
and structure practices. For the
two days afterward, there was a lot

“We have experience, maturity,
tremendous talent and a top-notch
recruiter in Dick Bradshaw.
Tonight we weren’t at our top level
of efﬁciency, but we’re starting to__
peak so we'll be ready for the
NCAAs. It looks as if our
preseason conditioning is paying
off since we’re undefeated in
diving this year,” he said.

The nondiving stars of the meet
were Jerry DeMuro, who won the
1,000-yard freestyle with a 9:53.91
and the 500-yard free with a
4:40.51, and ‘John Schepner, who
won the 100- and 200-yard
freestyles.

Kent State’s only highlight came
when it went 1-2 in the 200-ﬂy.
State Coach Tod Boyle was only
somewhat disappointed by his
team’s performance; the Kent
State season record dropped to 3-1.

“Pitt’s a ﬁne team and they
showed it tonight,” he said. “We

a double winner in the 65-high
hurdles and the 300-yard dash
(33.2). '

Dennis Hobbs ran 6.4 "in the
trials of the 60-yard dash, but
ﬁnished a close second to Walker in
the ﬁnals.

Pitt also prevailed in the ﬁeld
events. Freshman Eric Drescher
won the shot put with a distance of
52-2. Sophomores Keith Taylor
and Dan Goodyear ﬁnished first
and second, respectively, in the
high jump. The winning jump was
6-5. The pole vault was the only
event in which Pitt lost ﬁrst place;
Paul Ciotti came in second. ’

went back on our weight program
and I think it hurt our performance.
But then even our best perfor-
mance probably wouldn’t have
done it,” he said.

Pitt Head Coach Dick Bradshaw
was obviously very happy about his
team's big win.

“This might be our springboard’

since we’ve now won‘ the second of
our four big ones. I was pleased
with our performance, and we're
starting to begin our peaks. This
year’s team has a lot of depth.

‘ “We also have a good senior
class, and the freshmen are our
strongest ever,” he said.

In the next three weeks, Pitt will
face Maryland and Ohio State, two
swimming powers. But after
Friday’s performance ,' one wonders
if the Tankers might not go
undefeated, even if all their
remaining opponents start sporting
“Win, Win, Win” on their
warm-up shirts.

Mel Boyd, Nick Martin and Tom
Herrmann had repeat performan-
ces of the week before and remain
undefeated in their ‘specialties.
Boyd's 9:17 two-mile was sufficient
to win, and teammates John
Heiser, Bob Lee and Ron Wirick
ﬁnished slightly behind the win-
ning mark.

Martin won the mile _in 4:16.9,
followed by Dave McDonald with a
4:18 third place. Herrmann
continued his reign in the
1000-yard run with a time of 2:18.
John Bieranowski and Mark
