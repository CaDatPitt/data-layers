Senior Staff Writer

A single one—and—a-half inch cold-water
pipe was responsible for extensive water-
damage on several floors of Lothrop Hall
yesterday afternoon.

“The pipe has had a temporary repair
made to it, and we’re now checking out
the rest of the system,” said interim Director
of the Office of Residence Life Bob Hopkins
yesterday evening. “We hope to have
water back on lsoonl.”

The rupture began on the 10th floor of
the residence hall, where the water spread
to a depth of nearly an inch before seeping

\ into lower floors, residents said.

Hopkins said he could not speculate on,
the cause ofthe rupture but was not ruling
out work being done by the city on a 16-
inch water main.near the rcsidencehall as
a possible culprit.

Lothrop resident Dana Rodriguez said
the leaking water was responsible for
about $1,000 worth of damage in her
room. O

“When I came in, there was about an
inch of wateron the floor,” Rodriguez
said./"I walked in and just started crying.
Everything was a mess.

“Every pair of shoes 1 have is ruined,”
Rodriguez said. Other casualties included
Rodriguez’s.computer printer.

“You'd think that with the money we
spend for these rooms we wouldn’t have
these problems,” Rodriguez said.

Brenda Batenburg experienced similar
problems. I

“I have a foam chair that is saturated.
That’s the only way to describe it,”
Batenburg said. ‘‘I have no idea if there’s
any damage to any electrical appliances.
Everything’s unplugged, and we can’t plug
it in right now,” Batenburg said.

Hopkins said he was concerned about

Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor’s controversial,
$92,550 installation is just days
away, but the university has
not been able to convince
everyone the spending is
justified.

Much of the money,
according to Provost Donald
Henderson, will come from
reserve funds which could have
beenspent many different
ways, including to establish

student scholarships. Other
funding will come from alumni
donations.

According to university
spokesperson Tim Ziaukas, no
state appropriation or tuition
money will be used.

Some students argue that the
cost of the the installation is
extravagant in a time of
economic hardships. Others say
that as long as the money comes
from private funds the
university is justified in
spending whatever it feels is
necessary.

' invested

Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance co-President ’l'odd
Kinavey said the spending is
wasteful.

“Its a waste of money. There
are better things that can be
done with $92,000. lt’s
outrageous to spend money
on this installation during a
recession, when people like
me are struggling to pay
tuition," he said.

Karen Balls, a junior, agreed
that more money should be
into the student
population. “My friends and l

have been discussing this, and

we think it's outrageous. [Pitt

needs] more dorms and
computers.”

Sophomore David Lutz said
the installation ceremony was
necessary, but he added that

‘Pitt should put more emphasis

on raising money for students.

private source, I think it’s fine.

Marick Masters, administrator of the
Joseph M. Katz School of Business,
formally announced Saturday that he
will run in this spring’s congressional
Democratic primary, saying he favors
affordable education and increased health
care.

University Democrats President Joel
Leonard will run Masters’ campaign.

In his announcement speech, Masters
attacked the Bush administration, saying
the Republican leaders have delivered a
“harsher, colder reality” rather than the
kinder, gentler nation they promised.

Although Masters has never held
elected office, he said, ‘'11 is important
that people who have not chosen politics

University administrator officially begins bid or Cgress

think that if’

as a career enter politics. I believe that
my experience with business, labor and
education qualify me for office.”

Masters is the director of the university’s
master’s of business administration
program and was previously a professor
of business at Pitt. '

“Masters will not support any new
taxes,” Leonard said. “He is in favor of
improving health care and making
education affordable.”

“I support funding of Head Start for
young children, increased student loans
and a domestic health-care plan funded
by prudent, responsible reductions in
the defense budget,” Masterslsaid.

He described himself as a fiscally
conservative Democrat who believes in
“making health carea right rather than a
privilege landl making America first in

manufacturing.”

Leonard said the campaign is “just
getting organized now at the grassroots
level.” Leonard has worked for political
campaigns at all state and national levels.

Masters decided to run when Rep. Rick
Santorum defeated former Rep. Doug
Walgren in November'.i990 for the 18th
congressional district seat.

He described Santorum_ as an
“opportunist” who has “done some things
that are not representative of the people
of western Pennsylvania,” such as vote
against extended unemployment beneﬁts.

In his announcement speech, Masters
said “trickle down economics and tax
gimmicks will not put people to work
[or] make health care more affordable;
nor will they restore our manufacturing
base.”

Coping on Campus

Sexual harassment not uncommon

Many people dispute the
existence, the prevalence and the
severity ofthe problem of sexual
harassment. ()ur experience with
clients at the University
Counseling Center suggests to us
that the issue is real, is not
uncommon and can have far-
reaching effects on the lives of
those involved.

How does sexual harassment
manifest itself in the university
setting? The problem is ongoing
and diverse, and it is not restricted,
as many may think, to women or
to students. Both male and female
faculty members, for instance,

have had their lives severely.

disrupted by students who have
fallen in love with them and
refused to believe that their
feelings were not mutual. These
cases, however, are relatively rare
compared to the instances of
harassment experienced by
female staff members and female
students. Much ofthe harassment
of students that we encounter is

at the hands of other students.
Sometimes this harassment is
exceptionally nasty or stressful
and is a major distraction in the
student's life. At other times it is
a short—lived annoyance that the
student, with a little help, can
handle.

When the harassment of a

woman student or staff member

is at the hands of someone in a
position of authority, such as a
supervisor or a faculty member,
this experience is almost always
traumatic. in spite of the stress

involved in these cases, many of

these individuals are able to
develop strategies for handling

the problem without major '

disruptions in their lives. In some
cases, however, the sexual
coercion is so severe and
persistent that these woman have
had to quit jobs, drop courses,
change majors or even leave
school to avoid the harassment.

Although many recipients of
sexual harassment may feel

   

\.\\a.

r/

 Robe/rt
Gallagher

trapped and powerless, there are
actions they can take. The
university has established
grievance procedures to
specifically address the problem.
People are often reluctant to use
these procedures for a variety of
reasons, but we encourage
individuals who are trapped in

on campus

harassing situations to overcome
their hesitation and to talk to
someone. Formal charges can be
filed through the Office of
Affirmative Action, 901 WPU. You
need to know, however, that in
certain situations this office is
required by law to investigate
reports of sexual harassment. Most
cases, however, are resolved in
an informal manner.

lfyou are uncertain about what
action to take, you can make an
anonymous call to Affirmative
Action (648-7860) to seek advice
or to obtain names of people
who would be willing to serve as
confidential consultants. You can,
of course, also talk in confidence
with a psychologist at the
University Counseling Center, 554
WPU. There are almost always
strategies that can be found to
handle these situations, and there

. are a lot of people on campus

willing to help. I encourage you
to make use of these campus
resources.

You can’t get a job
without experience;  
So, how do you get
experience without a
job?

City’s Heinz Hall hosts
‘Concert of the Future’

By Heather York
Staff Writer

Does the word “symphony” conjure up images of stuffy,
middle—aged adults and somber audiences discussing the pros
and cons of age—old music? If so, the Pittsburgh Symphony has
promised to change the picture.

“The Concert of the Future” is coming to Heinz Hall tomorrow.

The revamped symphony will include light shows, audience
participation and other out-of-the-ordinary additions. The purpose
of the event is to attract a younger, college-aged audience, said
Sylvie Turner, director of public relations.

“lt will keep you guessing all the time,” she said.

The music at the concert will be both classical and
contemporary, selected from surveys conducted at local colleges.
“We want to find out what the college community wants to
hear,” Turner said. .

Gideon Toeplitz, executive vice president and managing
director of the symphony, created the Concert of the Future to
find out what would attract a younger audience to the concerts,
Turner said. Last year’s concert featured light shows, slide
presentations and poetry readings.

“We found that the audience really liked to hear people
talking from the stage,” Turner said. “The audience liked hearing
what the music is about, and now we incorporate this interaction
into our regular shows.”

This year’s program will also add computer interaction. The
symphony will show how 'l'chaikovsky’s “I812 Overture” may
have been written had he used a computer. For the first time in
the symphony’s history, three musicians will have an
improvisational “jam session” with a preprogrammed computer.

Other experiments will include the use of audience
participation, with members choosing selections by applause.
Environmental poetry will be recited with background music.

The concert will be followed by a question-and-answer
period and a reception with symphony members.

Last year’s concert attracted over 1,500 people, and Turner
said expectations are high for Wednesday’s show.

LCI provides cross-cultural training

By Kellie Burkett
For The Pitt News

Imagine you are a Pitt graduate
and a successful business
executive. Your company has just
transferred you tojapan. How do
you know how to interact and
live in Japanese society or greet
your Japanese peers? When do
you present your business cards?
How much do you tip a server in
a Tokyo restaurant?

Learning and Cultural Institute
is a program provided in affiliation
with the College of General
Studies to assist travel-planning
people in the development of
their linguistic skills and cultural
sensitivity in a country other than
their own.

“The LCI provides custom-
designed, cross-cultural training
programs and language-training
programs,” according to Director
Dr. Rebecca Setliff. “Our goal is
to provide a set of realistic
expectations about living and
interacting somewhere else -
wherever somewhere else is.”

The programs and seminars
are open to the, public,‘ and l.Cl
will accommodate for any
country. Training includes
experiences in language, food,
history, economy, male—female
roles and day-to—day living in a
foreign culture. I . ,

Setliff said experts are hired to
give speeches and language
training on a program-to-program
basis. Seminars have been given
on China, Germany, Brazil,_lapan,

Australia, Canada and several
other countries. Seminars on
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are in
the preparation stages.

l.Cl began in the 1970s, when
former Pittsburgh Mayor Richard
Caliguiri asked the university to
prepare him in Chinese. culture

-for an up—coming trip to the

country. Dr. lidward Anthony met
the. mayor’s request, and since
then the program has been
operated and advertised simply
by word—of-mouth.

Setliff, who took over after

Anthony’s retirement in l9‘)(), said
l.(Il primarily trains business
exectitix-'es and scholars.
Currently, l.Cl is assisting an
officer from i\litsubishi lilectric
Corporation (headquartered in
Kamakura,Japan) in an intensive,
four-week, l-Inglish and American
cultural-orientation program to
prepare him for a nine-week
management class at lioston’s
Sloan School of Management.

Aside from the four hours of
linglish and several hours of

homework per day, the oflicer
also attends lL1nC~T_h(!()llS' and
evening activities to meet and
interact with unive.rsity and
business representatives.

In March LCI will be preparing
a family for a two-year move to
Japan in collaboration with the
Council of International Visitors.

l.(Il will present a four-part
series of briefings for traveling
Americans to learn why foreign
cultural consideration is
important.

  IBM

“Culture is a skill that you learn,”
Setliff said.“ “When you meet
people and hear them talk about
their culture, you develop a sense
of how we are the same —— just
like knowing what the differences
are. It makes you more sensitive.
What we do is try to introduce the
skill oflearnin g culture by painting
it into something more tangible -
— like moving from Pittsburgh to
Las Vegas. We then translate .this

understanding into the bigger,

picture. This way, you develop a
keener sense of awareness.”

Since each program has its own
budget, the costs of the programs
vary according to the number of
people involved and the length
of the program. In the past, LCI
has had programs ranging from
$300 to $90,000. Program times
have also ranged from one hour
to seven months.

A businessman from Tokyo
wanted his son, a 24-year-old
college graduate, to become more
advanced in English and
international business.

“For seven months I became

. his mother, friend and teacher,”

Setliff said.

Although LCI is financially
dependant, CGS offers staff
support and advisory services.

“CGS develops many
community-outreach services,
and this is another great
community service,” Setliff said.
“CGS has been wonderful to the
l.Cl, and the program is becoming
more involved with the university.
We think it’s great.”

Van-call shuttle service available to students

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

Door-to-door transportation is
now available for Pitt students
due to the recently instituted
Student Government Board VAN-

” CALI. Service. Students can call

the van for a ride to anywhere in
North or South Oakland or to the
Hill.

l-Zach van has a cellular phone
which can be accessed by calling
either /I91-/IV/\;\’ or 638-6VAl\'.
The vans run until 3 ant. Tuesday

through Saturday and until 2 a.m.
Sunday and Monday. The cellular
phones come on at 7 p.m.

“'l'his service is much more
efficient than the old one. Though
we had to fight tooth and nail to
see our point of view, after seeing
the popularity of the service, they
realized this was the right thing to
do. They had to go along with
us,” board member Jacob Brody
said.

Certain crimes have sparked
student concern toward safety at
Pitt. Because of student reaction,

the SGB contracted from Laidlaw
Transit Co. a shuttle which could

be accessed by cellular phone. ,

This VAN-CALL service operated
from mid-November to early
February and cost approximately
$165 per day. Due to the
popularity of the service the Board
felt that a more cost-effective
service could be instituted
permanently, according to an SGB
report to the university
community.

In the past, a South Oakland’

Shuttle and a shuttle that would

transport students to the Hill was
available, but these shuttles
originated from the William Pitt
Union and followed a route. If a
student was not at the llnion to
take the shuttle, transportation
was not available from North or
South Oakland to central campus.

The two new shuttles have
been transformed into the VAN-
CAl.l. service.

'I‘he cost of the service is
significantly cheaper, and the
board does not have to spend
any student—activities monies,

according to the report.

“Students are basically getting
a free ride wherever they want to
go, but we are adults and we
must take responsibility for our
own safety, and we must treat the
people who provide the service
with respect,” Brody said.

Riders of the van must show a
Pitt ID and fill out the necessary
paperwork before riding.

Any questions or comments
should be directed to Jacob
Brody in the SGB office at 648-
7970.

Alnmnoze estozblis/9 program to support senior women

By George Kopec
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Pitt’s Alumnae Association discussed its
new program, Career Launch, which is
aimed at career development and
networking for senior women, during a
meeting ofits board of directors last night.

“We need to bring senior women in

' touch with the alumnae,” said Dr. Mary

Francis Archey, head of the board's Career
Launch committee. Archey said the aim of

- the program is to help senior women meet

with successful alumnae in their field 0

employment. ‘
Board member Stella Yaksich said the

program is a good idea because, “We can

give them more personal kinds of advice
than what they would get at_ a job fair.
Things like how to deal with employers,
we can let them know about both the
good and bad aspects.” g .

Archey added that the program will also
focus on “tapping into the job market. The
development aspect of the program will
help senior women with the essentials of
being successful: things like applying and
interview skills.”

Archey said she hopes to begin the
program in November at the earliest and
March 1993 at the latest. “We are in the
very early planning stages of this right
now, so we really do need some input,”
she said. In other business, two

members of Pitt’s Women’s Studies
Program were on hand to present their
goals to the board.

Dr. Susan Hansen, program director,
said she has come across many examples
of sexism in the academic world.

She said her favorite example is the
history text she had when she was in
college. “The first chapter was titled
‘America Under ller Native Sons,’ and it
began, ‘History is the story of mankind.
We try to tell thegstory of man in America
from the beginning.’ One looks in vain in

‘books from that era for any reference to

women as thinkers, as artists or as historical
actors in.their own right,” Hansen said.
Hansen said, “The problem wasn’t that

women had done nothing, but that their
accomplishments had gone unrecognized. ”

Dr. Britta Dwyer, research assistant
professor, said in order to make changes,
“Women have to work together and make
more noise, because men are better at
making noise.”

But l-Iansen stressed that “we have a
great deal to offer male students as well.
Men in the work force of the future will
need to understand diverse needs."

Virginia Dunst, president of Pitt’s
Alumnae Association, said the winner of
the association’s scholarship will be

announced in early March. The scholarship ‘

is for up to $5,000 and is awarded to a
junior woman.

Harassment issue continues

 

By Susan Swiderski
For The Pill News

Sexual harassriient was brought to the
forefront ofArnerican media by University
of ()klahoma law professor Anita Hill
when she accused Supreme Court nominee
Clarence 'l'homas,ofinappropriate conduct
in the workplace. But has llill's testimony
helped solve the problem?

‘‘I believe the Clarence Thomas hearings
increased awareness of the problem, at
least temporarily,” said Anne Levenson,
Associate l)ean of the College of General
Studies. “People sat up and said, ‘Oh, that
counts,’ or ‘Oh, l don't have to put up with
that.”

Levenson warned that awareness is not
synonymous with change. Because people
are made aware of the criteria for sexual
harassment does not mean they feel their
behavior is unacceptable.

People become defensive about this
topic because they want to have their
behavior criticized. That sentiment keeps
the ‘-‘Can't you take a joke?" mentality in
the forefront, Levenson said.

“If Anita llill latiglit us one thing, it is to
tell everybody. The harassed person has
nothing to be ashamed of," Levenson said.

“They are not responsible for the harasser’s
behavior, and the situation should not be
allowed to happen.”

The Office of Affirmative Action at Pitt
has outlined a policy which defines sexual
harassment and explains informal and
formal resolutions to combat the problem.

If a formal complaint is filed, a full
investigation of the the situation will be
made. If the accused individual is found
guilty of sexual harassment, disciplinary
action is administered depending on the
severity of the offense. Action can range
between a reprimand and termination of
employment.

“Talk to an experienced university person
you trust. An effort is always made to solve
these problems informally,” Levenson said.
“’l‘he most effective way to stop feeling
powerless is.to take action, even though
feeling vulnerable can be frightening.”

According to Levenson, Anita Hill
showed the country what a dignified
woman can do in standing up for her
rights. In order for change in society to
continue, people cannot just shrug and let
incidents pass.

“The struggle is never over," Levenson
said. “It will take a lot oftough, hard work,
but gains can be made."

money for scholarships," he said.

Sophomore Ken Segarnick disagreed.
He said the installation was a bad move,
politically, for O'Connor.

"1 think it’s quite inappropriate for
him to be spending this kind of this
money. Governor lltobertl Casey is
cutting a few million from the school.
It's bad [public relations]. It’s not a good
way to start out,” Segarnick said.

Pittstudent Adam Novak said some of
the money should have been used for
undergraduate scholarships. \

“I think it’s extravagant. l agree with
Gil Golden when he brought up the
point that the money could be spent on
scholarships,” Novak said.

I-lolly McGarry, a first-year student,
said, "1 still feel that it is an outrageous
amount of money, and it could have
been spent in other ways. Maybe it
could be spent on student activities,
maybe health care."

Junior Kelli Kanhofer said she
understands the importance oftradition
but also sees the financial reality of the
situation. “Even though tradition goes
back for so many years, we didn't liave
the economic problems then that we

have now."

Kevin Jones, a third-year student,
agreed. ‘‘I think it was a little too high.
There should probably be a limit on
things like that because people are
having a hard time,” he said.

Continuing student Terri Dibella said
she can see both sides. “ I think that it’s
important to maintain traditions and to
make significant changes meaningful.
They should be recognized, but I also
think that you should take into
consideration the current economic
situation and whether or not-they are
being extravagant.”

While students may be split, rival
political groups Find themselves on the
same side.

Rob Lewis of the College Republicans
said “lCRsl are for fiscal responsibility,
and we can't seem to find any in the
current administration."

President of University Democratsjoel
Leonard said that although a time-
honored tradition such as installing a
new president should be celebrated,
the university could have spent less.

‘‘I don’t think that $92,000 is an
appropriate amount to spend on an
installation_.”_

‘Changes in the exterior of

These guidelines were designed
to keep the character of the area

Democratic offering

This year’s presidential selection is as colorful and full
of variety as the selection of Kellogg's cereals at the Giant
Eagle.

On the Republican side there are the currently unpopular
President George Bush, frat boy Patrick Buchanan and the
contentious former Ku Klux Klan member, David Duke.
Certainly nothing too interesting on the Republican side.

The Democratic ticket is a bit more upbeat.

Paul ’l'songas, Bill Clinton, Jerry Brown, Tom Harkin
and Bob Kerrey are on the full Democratic menu.

in the last debate televised for the New Hampshire
voters, each candidate was afforded an opportunity to
steal the race. Bill Clinton advanced his accomplishments
as governor of Arkansas.

Ex-Senator Paul Tsongas reminded America that it must
reform economically from within, while Harkin and
Kerrey mentioned the 1992 buzzwords — “trade with
Japanf’ V

Former California Covernorjerry Brown maintained his
commitment to a flat, I3-percent income tax. He also
blasted “special interests.” ’

Capturing extended coverage, the media darling Bill
Clinton offers a plan sure enough to capture the White
House in the November election. A

At the moment, Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, presents the
strongest platform and is the likely choice for the Democrats’
presidential slot. '

Clinton supports a capital-gains tax cut for long-term
investments. He also advances a middle-class tax cut
supported by tax increases levied against individuals
earning over $200,000. V

Clinton's economic strategy incorporates centrist and
progressive initiatives3i~_il«lLiS policy will carryvotes and at
the same time improve the United States’ economic
outlook.

Clearly differing from the present administration, Clinton,
as well as his Democratic colleagues, support universal
health care. Specifically, he backsprev.entative careand

I controlling costs through insurance reform. Unlike the

Bush health-care proposal, the Democrats will capture
more and more votes. The present health-care system,
which Bush constantly apologizes for, fails to meet the
needs of the public.

Clinton is clearly mainstream and reasonable on a
number of issues. Not onlyis Clinton pro-choice, he has
expressed support to end the Department of Defense’s
ban keeping lesbian, bisexual and gay people from
serving their country's military.’ 9

No matter what decision New Hampshire reaches
today, the Democrats should seize the moment. Already
their race has captured the attention of the United States.

’l'his time around the Democrats, in particular Bill
Clinton", finally offer a product worthy of presidential
consideration and backing.

O’Connor’s installation hurts Pitt fundraising

I am a senior who works in the
Development and Alumni Affairs
office. My job is to call alumni
and ask for donations to the
different- departments, such as
CAS and Engineering. Alumni
donations pay 1/3 of the cost of
a student to attend Pitt. Another
third comes from the student’s
tuition, and the final third comes

from state funding. As I'm sure
you know, state funding was
recently cut by Governor-[Robert]
Casey. That cut will cause an
increase in tuition and makes my
job all the more important to
keep a tuition increase as low as
possible.

However [Dr. O'Connor's]

"recent extravagant spending is

making my job more difficult.
Just this past week I have had
many refusals for pledges, even
from alumni who give every year,
and every refusal involves the
subject of your spending habits.
is it really necessary to spend
$92,500 on an installation?
Remembering back a few months
(which alumni haven't forgotten),
was it necessary to spend over
$100,000 on lO'Connor'sl office?
And is it necessary to have a
meeting in the Cayman Islands?

lO'Connor'sl new “budget” is
hurting the students. I wish [he]
could have my job for even one
day, and [he] Could explain to
alumni why [he is] spending
money so carelessly. Is it so much
to ask fora chancellor who spends
Pitt’s money rationally? I think
not.

Serfs revolt against installation

Few lone students can claim
that university officials have ever
heeded their advice, but back in
October, in these same pages, I
urged Dr. O'Connor to start
running the university like a
university and not a business. Lo
and behold, a month ago, citing
exactly those reasons, O'Connor
requested that his title be changed
from the business-like “president”
to the more academic
“chancellor.”

But is chancellor the right title

for our leader? Perhaps the Board
of Trustees should offer him
something that better justifies the
$92,000 induction costs — a title
that really deserves a coronation.

“King” Dennis? Too flashy. "

Letters ’

Perhaps just Prince Dennis or, to
be totally feudal, Lord Dennis.
Perhaps these suggestions are
not academic enough (reportedly
the reason for the initial titular
change), but is spending $92,000
academic at all? With the
university in the, supposed
financial crunch administrators
claim, spending $92,000 on a day
of “festivities” is not academic —
it’s asinine. '

$Once’ our feudal lord is
crowned, who knows what will
come next? Increased tribute
payments to Lord ()’Connor (in
the form of the tuition hike)?
Perhaps a fierce war for increased
landholdings (raiding lCarnegie
Mellonl for
property)?

But as lowly serfs, what can we
do? lRevoltsl will be brutally
crushed (complete with the armed
university police). Reform looks
impossible. (Corruption seems
ingrained.)

'l'hat leaves religion. It worked
well in the Middle Ages —- the
serfs were happy knowing that a
pleasant afterlife awaited them.
For the student serf here at lthel
University of Pittsburgh, the wait
won't be too long — at most, if
your a freshman, four years.

"O" pizza installation option
I hear our president, U .l Dennis
()’Connor, is throwing a $92,550
bash for his installation as
chancellor of our ﬁne university.
This may sound expensive, but
apparently the feeling is that more
money will be brought to Pitt in
donations than the cost of the
ceremony, thus “justifying” the
outlandish price of the party. If
Dennis is really a likeable man,

development .

as any man in his position should
be, he shouldn’t need that much
money to impress other people.
He should be able to impress
them simply on his wit and
qualities as a man, and if it’s still
necessary to have dinner and
throw a party, line. There are
28,120 students at Pitt. With the
$92,550 for his party, Dennis could
buy each one of. us an “O” pizza,
and he would still have $3,409.60
leftover. ,

With that money, he could take
his 350 guests out to McDonald’s
fordinner and still have about
$1,660 left over. With that, Dennis
could get 41 kegs of Bud and a
few bottles of Mad-Dog and throw
a small party right here at my
apartment. If I were to charge $2
per person, I could make, uh,

Student "Health"?

When will common sense and

My daughter, Laura, called for

extremely sore throat to be told
the next available [appointment]
would be in two weeks. They did
advise her to come in and wait —
her turn to see a nurse.‘ Upon
arriving with a fever of 102,
vomiting, she waited for two
hours to have a throat culture
taken. She was sent home with a
prescription for Tylenol and
codeine. The major side effect of
this medicine is vomiting...

Sickening

Anemic 15.6% first-half shooting

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Sports Writer

It may have been a case of the
flu that made Pitt senior guard
Sean Miller sick last night, but it
could just as easily have been the
first-half play of his team.

The 22nd-ranked Pirates of
Seton Hall blew the Panthers away
in the first half and never looked
back on the way to an 82-63
victory in East Rutherford, NJ.
Pitt’s record falls to 15-11 overall,
7-5 in the Big East. Seton Hall is
now 16-6, 8-5 in the conference.

The Panthers seemed to be in
good shape early. Miller was
playing despite the illness. Pitt
trailed 9-7 when Pirate guard
Terry Dehere left the game after
picking, up his second foul on a
charge with 15:04 remaining in
the first half. Then things fell
apart for the Panthers.

Junior guard Daryl Crist,
Dehere’s replacement, started the
run with a three—point shot. That

began a 17-0 stretch by the Pirates. 9

Pitt’s scoreless streak lasted 10
minutes and 14 seconds. Even
worse, the Panthers missed 20
straight shots from the field in
that time and did not attempt a
free throw.

Miller left during the drought
and did not return. His absence
and mounting frustration led to
bad shot selection. Darren
Morningstar ﬁnally ended the rut
with a running, layup and foul
with 5:35 remaining.’ ' ‘

The Pirates extended the lead
to 21 on a three-pointer by first-
year forward John Leahy and two
free throws by Darrell Mims. Two
free throws by Morningstar cut
the lead to 35-16 at the half.

Morningstar scored nine of 16

“Unbelievable! I'm ecstatic!”

“I’m so psyched  This is incredible.”

Those were the reactions of Dave
Bausmith and Stu Yoss of the Pitt men's

_ gymnastics team after they each bested

personal scoring marks in a meet against
Kent State on Saturday.

Bausmith had an all—around total of
54.15 points, and Yoss had 52.95 — the
best scores either man has ever had in the

all-around competition. Those scores gave ‘
them first and second place, respectively,-

in individual all-around.
The personal triumph was especially

v sweet for Bausmith, who has become the

Panthers’ gritty leader in the absence of
Genaro Severino. At the beginning of this
season, Bausmith could only dream of
achieving 54 points in an all-around
competition. Saturday was truly a dream
come true.

“On about three different occasions this
season, I came very close to the 54-point
mark but never quite reached it, " Bausmith
said. “I’m so glad I finally did it  I'm very
happy with my performance today."

Yoss attributed his excellent performance

“The guys on the team are great ..

today.”

The meet itself was a tight battle
highlighted by several sparkling individual
performances by members of both teams.
Despite the accomplishments of Bausmith
and Yoss, as well as the effort of every
other Pitt gymnast, the Panthers fell short
in the end and lost the meet, 269.80 points
to 265.65. Panther head coach Frank
D’Amico, however, said he does not view
this as a setback.

Scbool ’s mfor unsteady Panthers

As the crowd started filing out of Saturday
night's debacle that was supposed to be a
basketball game between Pitt and St. John’s, I
wondered if Pitt head coach Paul Evans was
thinking to himself why the crowd was leaving
early? He has complained about this in the past,

Stephen Flinn

calling it an eyesore for television audiences to
observe and saying it gives a black eye to the
Panther basketball program.

Well, I wondered the same thing Saturday
night, but the shoe was on the other foot. I knew
why the crowd gave up with over three minutes
left; that much was obvious. Rather I wondered
why Evans gave up.

livans chose not to foul the St. john’s players
to stop the clock even though Pitt was down by
13 points with less than three minutes left.

He had virtually nothing to lose because
nothing went right for the Panthers the entire
night. The only thing l-Ivans accomplished was
driving the nail into the Panthers’ coffin when
he got called for a technical foul with 7:17 left
in the game. Bad enough the technical cost Pitt
a much—necded possession; St. John's got two
free throws to boot, making one of them. But
worst of all, livans’ technical was completely
lackluster. llejwas sitting there motionless on
the bench and apparently said something under
his breath just loud enough for one of the
officials to hear. 'l'his was not one of livans’
patented tiratles, which usually serve to fire up

the crowd and sometimes the players. Rather it

was just an added misery to a completely awful
night.

St. john’s got the opening tip-off and virtually
never looked back. The coaching staff never
made any noticeable adjustments but kept
replacing player after player to try and stop the
Redmen’s momentum. '

I thought after halftime that some adjustments
would be made to shake things up a little and try
to halt or at leastslow down St. John’s’ excruciating
pace and almost unstoppable momentum, but
Pitt looked as ﬂat the second half as it did in the
first — especially on defense. Note that this is
Pitt’s second game in the past three that the
rebounding has been absolutely atrocious, and
although Sean Miller and Chris Gant had career-
high scoring games, you win games by playing
as a team — something Pitt failed to do Saturday
night

So the grade I give Pitt’s performance in the 84-
7/1 defeat (it wasn't really that close) was about
a D+; that goes to the players for their lackadaisical
play and the coaches for not making the necessary
adjustments to curb either the Panthers’ awful
effort or the Redmen’s gruelling pace. Pitt’s
assignment for the next game is a crash course in
boxing out and getting position on the boards,
the most noticeable liability as of late. St. John's
outrebounded Pitt 43-26.

And while they are at it, the Panthers better
cram on all the fundamentals if they expect to do
good on their finals (the Big East tournament)
and get accepted into grad school (the NCAA
tournament). But after the way the Panthers
played last. Saturday, it may take a lot of all-
nighters to do it.

on the high bar, and Kyle Macbeth
with 9.1 on the parallel bars.

The team’s next meet is this
coming Saturday against ’l'emple
at Trees Hall, '1 p.m.

Bausmith described Temple as
a “national powerhouse. But this

is the best team I’ve ever been
on, so we’re gonna train real hard
and hopefully give ‘em a good
ﬁght”

D’/\mico said, “Temple is a
much better team than Kent State,
so we are gonna have to train
veryhard to have any chance
against them.”

qualified person to hire at the
time of Johnson’s illness and
subsequent death.

Bowman never asked for the
coaching position, and he showed
a lot of class by taking the job at
such a tough time for the
organization.

What is absurd about the whole
situation is how the players don’t
respond to Bowman as they did
to Johnson.

When Johnson was here, he

practically anything. With
Bowman, it is as if the players are
just going through the motions. It
would be like an employee not
doing his work for his new boss
because he liked his old boss
better. '

In a case such as that, most
people would agree with the
employee being fired. In the case
of the Penguins, though, the fans
want the coach ﬁred. Bowman’s
job is_not that of a babysitter. The
players should respond equally
well for any coach they have, be
itJohnson, Bowman or anybody
else.

Also, getting a- new coach this
late in the season would be
ridiculous because the players
would/have to adapt to yet another
coaching philosophy. It’s time

Women’: Health Services...

for the Penguin fans and players
to accept the fact thatJohnson is
not coming back, and the Pens
are never going to ﬁnd another
coach like him.

So Penguin fans, just get used
to watching Scotty Bowman
behind the bench. Unlike past
coaches like Pierre Creamer and
Gene Ubriaco, Bowman has the
credentials to keep his job as
head coach.

Also, as a word of
“encouragement" to those
Bowman bashers, GM Craig
Patrick wants Bowman back for
next year and years to come.

- By seeing his impressive play
in the Olympics, I wonder if the
Penguins wish they had made an

effort to sign former Pen right V

winger/defenseman Scott Young.
With right wing Jaromir Jagr
suspended and with defenseman
Paul Coffey’s future status here
uncertain, Young surely could
have been a contributor to the
team the past few weeks.

Young's play on the power
play and as a winger could help
this team.

exercises, trailing the KSU squad by 1.4 points.
When all had been said and done, the Pitt squad
would have needed a 47.50 on the Iloor to tie
KSU. Unfortunately, the Lady Panthers continued
their problematic performances during the floor
exercises. Pitt’s floor squadscored 45.55
points, while KSU posted 46.10.

Problem areas for the Lady Panthers on the
floor came from two of Pitt's strongest ﬂoor
competitors: Venezia andJorgensen. During last
week's practices, Venezia started to work a new
tumbling pass into her routine. Her first tumbling
pass is now a frontsomersault into a double back
flip. While she performed this during Saturday’s
competition, she overrotated the double back
and was unable to land it.Yohman said she’d
rather see Venezia overrotate the pass because it
shows that she is really going after the pass.

“I was really nervous about the pass,” Venezia
said, “because this was my first time performing
it. I know I can do it because I've done it all week
in practice.

“I went out for it hard, and I just need a little
more practice on it,” Venezia added.

InJorgensen’s case, illness has been playing a
commanding role. She was unable to practice for
the better part of the week because she has been

fighting with the flu, but according toJorgensen, '

she has been sick since the team's’ return from

the Cat Classic. She also said she performed last
weekend because she wanted to do what she
could for the team.

“With Karen it was obvious that she was just
too weak to perform,” Yohman said. “She’s been
out of practice, and you can see that in all of her
routines — especially on floor. That was the
worst floor she's ever done.

“Karen was out two days [Tuesday and
Wednesday]. She practicedThursday, but Friday
she petered out again,” Yohman said.

During the first two events of the competition,
the Lady Panthers performed rather well. Pitt
tallied a 45.45 in the vaulting exercises and a
45.85 in the uneven parallel bars competition.

“Our vaults were nice," Yohman said. “I was
real pleased with vaulting. All of our tsuks are
better this season. These kids that were here last
year, like Tracy, didn't compete because their
tsu ks weren’t good enough. Her tsuk right now
is very good. '

“Kristin and Karen still have the weak vaults.
We need to upgrade them. Jeannie and Gina are
working on more difficult vaults," Yohman
added.

'I‘he Lady Panthers’ next meet will be on
Saturday, when they will be hosting the Lady
Owls of Temple University. The meet is scheduled
for I p.m. at Trees Hall. Admission is free with
a Pitt ID.

Hopkins Said he was
“very distraught” Over the
inconvenience and

property damage caused
by the broken pipe.

In an effort to prevent
further dainzigc to student

assistants unlocked the
doors ofstudents who were
not in their rooms and
escorted Custodial workers,
who moved possessions
off the floor to higher
ground,l lopkins Said.

He Said Students who
requested dry Sleeping
accomodations for the
night were being placed in
Spare rooms in Lothrop
and Holland halls.

“This is just one of those
things that happens,” Gil
Schaffcr of Housing and
Support Services Said. “You

Something like this can
