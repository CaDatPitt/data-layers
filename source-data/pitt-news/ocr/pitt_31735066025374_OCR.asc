SGB committee decides to put pressure on O'Connor

By John Temple
Staff Writer

During a meeting with Public Safety
Sergeant Charles Grier, the Student

Government Board Public Safety com-‘
mittee said that Chancellor O’Connor-

has not taken enough steps toward
adding two campus buses and three
shuttles to the transportation system
already in place.

The committee decided to send
O’Connor a letter signed by campus
organization leaders urging him to
take action on the campus safety mea-
sures proposedlby the chancellor’s

In addition, the committee decided
to compile a list of several safety
measures which will include the
creation of an escort service, im-
proved lighting on campus and the
additions to the campus transportation
system.

Committee Chairperson Shahla
Eberhardt said that she wants to see
public safety become a priority within
the administration.

“I think our main goal should be to
show them how important it is to keep
this campus safe,” Eberhardt said. “I
don’t want this campus to become
another Temple [Universityl.”

pushing O’Connor to declare a time-
frame for the implementation of the
plans.

“The letter could say we want a
month now or two weeks for you to
study these ideas before putting them
into effect if they are positive plans in
your view,” Grier said.

Eberhardt criticized the difficulty in
pushing ideas into the implementation
stage when working with the Pitt
bureaucracy. '

“This is what happens,” she said. “A
concern comes up from the student
body or administration and a commit-
tee is formed to study it. The commit-
tee does the research‘, and makes the

proposal, and the proposal goes up [to
the administration] and stops.”

The committee also discussed ways
to interest students in campus safety
seminars since they have recently been
unsuccessful in drawing student atten-
dance, despite the increase of crime in
the Oakland area.

“Seminars don’t work,” said
Eberhardt‘. “The only way they work is
if they are mandatory events or includ-
ed in Freshman Studies.”

Eberhardt said that students care
about their personal safety but don’t
want to give up time on their busy
schedules to attend non-mandatory
seminars.

Doctor Starzl and Tl9ePazzle People

By Holly Affeltranger
Staff Writer

Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, the internationally
renowned Pitt transplant surgeon, signed
copies of his new book, Memoirs of a
Transplant Surgeon: T be Puzzle People, yes-
terday afternoon at the University Book
Center.

Dr. Starzl sat in the fine arts section from
noon until 1:30 p.m. autographing books and
chatting with people.

Some of the‘ people who came to see Starzl
were pre—med students, medical students and
previous patients. 9

First-year student Nate Feduska was there to
get his father, who is also a kidney transplant
surgeon, a copy of the book. V

“I bought it because of the accomplishments
that Dr. Starzl has done,” Feduska said.

Starzl’s book details his life from the time he

. was-ta little boy growing up in LeMars, Iowa,

to his work as a transplant surgeon at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“Mainly I wanted to write something about
some ofthe interesting people I’Ve worked
with or treated along the years. And that’s
what I did,” Starzl said.

The whole process of writing this book took
14 months. Starzl wrote the entire book in
longhand and then edited it by himself.

Even though the official release of "the
book is today, the first printing has already
been sold and a second printing has been
started.

When asked about the success of his book,
Starzl said “It’s either surprising or they didn’t
order enough books.”

The profits of Starzl’s book will be donated
to a charity organization called TRIO, a trans-
plant recipient group.

Starzl’s book is now on sale at the
University Book Center. There are signed

copies available.

University library system
director is lorzg overa’ae

By Beth Kovaly

Staff‘ Writer

Despite a year-long search,
the university library system is
still without a permanent direc-
tor. '

Pitt Professor Keith McDuffie,
who was chair of the search
committee, said there were a
number of candidates but not
one was chosen for the posi-

' tion. '

“We had about 100 people
apply, and then we narrowed
this list down to about a dozen,”
McDuffie said. “We conducted
this whole search process and
finally narrowed our list down
to three and presented that list
to Provost Donald Henderson
[in June 1992l.”

McDuffie said that in August
his committee received a letter
from Henderson saying he
would not be appointing any-

one to the director’s position at
that time.

“lHendersonl felt we needed
even more outstanding candi-
dates than we had  and he
would not renew the search for
another year,” McDuffie said.

Delaying the search will leave
Pitt without a permanent direc-
tor of its library system for at
least two more"years, McDuffie
said.

“If you don’t start thesearch
until next fall [1993], it’ll take
another year to conduct it and
to appoint somebody.”

McDuffie said the delay may
also limit the quality and num-
ber of candidates for the posi-
tion.

“We found when we started
to look for candidates that a lot
of people were not interested in
Pitt. People thought there had
been problems between [two

Good as Gold    

SGB president Gil Golden loas two months left to shine

By Julie Sabol
The Pitt News

A daily planner, a pen and sus-
penders. Student Government Board
President Gil Golden says he is never
‘found without ‘any of the three.-

Though he only has two months left

in his term, Golden said he is still-

focusing on being the best SGB presi-
dent he canbe. However, when his
term ends, he will be ready to pass the
gavel. I p

“I could probably stay and do this
job for another year and be happy with
it, but it’s good to have fresh blood.
I’m looking forward to having a com-
petitive, interesting election, because
this year I will be sitting on the side-
lines.”

Though he has learned how to cope
with them, being the SGB president
has had some drawbacks, Golden said.
Often, people assume things about you
before they even meet you, he said.

“\X/hen I was a board member, [peo-
ple -assuming things about me] did
bother me, but now it doesn’t. I’ve

come to expect it. People like to talk,
sometimes it’s going to be good, some-
times it’s going to be bad, but it’s going
to happen.”

Golden said many people assume
that being stand-offish or conceited

comes with the title of SGB president, V

but with him that conception does not
apply.

“It’s easy to say someone like me
would be pompous or arrogant, but
from what I know, I’m not. I’m very
down to earth. I don’t do the kinds of
things I do to be proud of myself, I do
them to get the most out of my experi-
ence here at the University of
Pittsburgh. 1 want people to know
more things about me; “

One of the things most people don’t
know is that Golden is a self—pro—
claimed nature and animal lover. Also
an Eagle Scout, he proudly tells people
that he has always had a membership
to the zoo-and intends to be a life—long
member.

But he really doesn’t have to step out
of his apartment to find exotic crea-
tures. Though he would like to have
more, Golden said his pets now
include two ferrets, two African tree
frogs and two lizards.

“I used to have one ferret, but I felt
bad for it because I would leave for
the whole day so I got another to keep
it company.”

   

  
   

Golden plans to find a good home

for all his animals. He hopes to be,

accepted to medical school and looks
forward to someday working as a fami-
ly physician in a country setting.

“In five years, I will hopefully just be
finishing up medical school and in ten
years I hope to be a successful family
physician  I really like the people
aspect of being a doctor.” '

Before he can crack medical files, he
must settle for the privilege of cracking
a gavel every week at the public board
meetings. But when those meetings
end, Golden will return to being just
an average college student.

“I like to be around people. I like to
go out to a party or out with my
friends. I rarely like to be alone  I
tend to talk a lot so it’s good to have at
least one person to listen.”

A favorite past hangout of Golden’s'

includes the infamous Oakland bar

scene. “I used to go to C]’s all the time,‘

especially for quarter draft night,” he
said with a grin on his face.

And though he does still enjoy the

A medication that may cure
severe cases of social phobia is
being evaluated at the Research
Affective Disorder Clinic, a psy-
chiatric hospital at Pitt.

A social phobia is a fear or
anxiety inhibiting people from
performing normal activities in
public such as eating or drink-
Sing.

The research clinic’s eight-
week study, involving 36
patients, is testing a medication
called moclobemide.
Moclobemide is a medication
known to reduce anxiety in psy-

-w

chologically depressed people.
It is an anti-depressant drug_
aimed at combatinganxiety,
panic, fear and depression. It is
expected to be 10 to 20 percent
more effective and works with-
out the reactions associated with
most medications.

Dr. Johnathan ’ M. I

Himmelhoch, the developer of
the drug, said, “Doctors often
overlook the psychological
aspect of medication. However,
our study expects to teach the
world about possible cures for
social phobia.

-Swab the deck and earn some credits on Semester at Sea

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

While traveling from country to coun-
try on a cruise ship, Pitt students have
the opportunity to have fun and gain 12
credits with the Semester at Sea pro-
gram.

“Semester at Sea takes a global
approach, seeking to expose students to
a variety ‘of cultures and a variety of
political and economic systems with an
emphasis on comparative education,”
Semester at Sea Director of Admissions
and Marketing Paul Watson said. _

The program ‘was started to promote
awareness of global issues and tends to
focus on non-Western countries and
developing nations, according to
Watson. ,

While at sea, students take courses
mostly from the social sciences and
humanities, which are taught from an
international perspective.

_When they’re not in the classroom,

students can learn about countries with
“hands on” experience. The ship stops
at 11 ports of call all over the world at
which students can travel and tour on
their own.

“Some of the best experiences hap-
pen on that kind of travel.When they’re
just going off meeting people  having
those kind of chance encounters  I
think [those] provide the best experi-
ences when you’re visiting another
country,” Watson said. '

The experience of goingon the
Semester atgsea voyage is invaluable,
Watson said- S

“It; "would give‘:  student a definite
edge, definitely for graduate school.
Having that kind of" diverse experience
 would be helpful,” he said.

Because of the need for international
experience, the program is becoming
more and more useful to students.

The significance of this particular trip
is its return to the Ukraine, Watson said.
The last visit to the Ukraine was in the

spring of 1990 but due to the Gulf War
and turbulent situation in the Middle
East, the ship has not docked there
recently.

“We had to look at the political and
economic situation in the Ukraine and
Russia, but by and large because the
breakup was peaceful -- and while it’s
not stable economically —— it is feasible
to go back there,” Watson said.

When confronted with the issue of
safety on the trip Watson said that no
matter where one travels, there is a
chancethat things can take a twist.

“We stay in contact with the State
Department, we actually watch the
news very, very carefully and we’re
always thinking about what our alterna-
tives are,” Watson said.

Often times, the situations in many
Middle Eastern and small independent
nations changes rapidly, according to
Watson. i

“We are ready and able to change the
itinerary if [a situation] is that drastic,”

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Watson said.

The faculty on board are from all over
the country and offer insight into the
various ports, Watson said. “They’re
chosen based on their international
experience so they’re very capable in
teaching that course  from an interna-
tional perspective,” Watson said.

Semester at Sea originated in the early
‘60s when C.Y. Tung, who owned a
container shipping industry, saw other
uses for his ships besides transporting
goods. V ’

The program was ‘originally named
University of the Seven Seas and the
first academic sponsor was Chatlin
Collegein Orange, California. It was
then renamed World Campus Aﬂoat and
between 1975 and 1979 it was spon-
sored by the University of Colorado.
The current program, Semester at Sea,
moved to Pitt in 1981.

In order to be eligible for the trip stu-
dents must be in good academic stand-

Cartoons “Ren and Stimpy” and
“Doug.”

West said that he is not sur-
prised about the success of “Ren
and Stimpy.”

“It is just an old-fashioned
approach to cartoon making,
just like the Rocky and Bull-
winkle of 1961,” he said.

According to West, the suc-
cess of “Ren and Stimpy” is that
there is no message behind the
episodes, it is just a cartoon that
touches on subjects that affect
everyone, such as parents, col-
lege students and children.

Cartoons really don’t cut it
with the public anymore lacking

creativity and inspiration, he

inspire kids anymore. I think
we’re onto a renaissance thing
with this,” he said.

West attributes his interest of

voice to growing up around the
radio. He always imitated radio
and was fascinated by people’s
voices.

was Mel Blanc, who was the
Voice for many of the Warner
Brothers’ 'Looney Tunes car-
toons.

stopped doing drugs and alco-
hol and considered himself a

preceding] directors and the
administration,” he said. “A
lot of people out there in
library land thought it was a
tough job, and you might get
in trouble going to Pitt.”

McDuffie said that a new
administration was changing
such opinions of the school,
but that if a new search was
not started soon, potential
candidates may begin to
doubt,Pitt’s seriousness in
the matter.

A second reason he said
the search should not be
delayed for a year is due to
the upcoming decisions that
have to be made concerning
the future of Pitt’s libraries.

“Right now we’re talking
about a new library,”
McDuffie said. “The sooner
that new director is here, the

ought to be in on these deci-
sions. The longer you wait
the less involved that person
will be.”

The search committee -was
appointed by the Provost,
who was himself an acting
director of the libraries at
one time. It consisted of
12 people including faculty,
staff librarians, a graduate
and an undergraduate stu-
dent. ,

“We thought that we had
presented good candidates,
but that is a question of

better, because that person,

judgement,” he said. “Our
problem was waiting another
year. We felt that the library
needed to _be given the lead-
ership of a new director as
soon as possible.”

McDuffie said he thinks the
Provost hopes to improve
the field of candidates by
waiting ayear.

“[Henderson] didn’t think
that the three individuals that
were named by the commit-
tee had what he called a
‘constellation of qualities’ he
was looking for. It’s such an
important job that if the
Provost is not convinced,
then he has a right not to

‘appoint them,” McDuffie

said.
The director of the univer-

"sity library system assumes

responsibility for the 18 Pitt
libraries as wellas the associ-

ated libraries,_ the ,four- A

regional campus libraries’ and
the medical division, In
terms of books, that is over

0 3.2 million volumes, as well

as microforrns and serials.

The current acting director
of the libraries is Paul
Kobulnicky, who has been in
the position since November
of 1990.

Although Kobulnicky was
originally a candidate for the
position, McDuffie said he
was not selected by the com-
mittee to be interviewed as a
final candidate.

Favoring human rights

As a nation whose foundations were built upon
two of the most important documents ever written —
the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights -—-
American democracy has proved to be the model for
many of the subsequent documents involving human
rights...And as a nation we should be proud of this

'}-‘fact. Congress seems to be; George Bush does not.

President Bush just recently vetoed legislation that
would eliminate ‘most favored trade status with
China. ' _ .

While most favored trade status simply provides for
protection against unusually high tariffs, and in‘reali-
ty, means little -—~ the actions of Congress would
have been a first step towards real action.

President Bush argues that restricting trade to China
’would only hurt ordinary Chinese citizens and the
American companies that sell goods there.

Perhaps this statement would be true’ if it was the
average Chinese citizen who benefitted from
increased trade between the two nations.

The truth is, however, the average citizen of China
has more to lose from Bush’s vetoed legislation.
Whatever China calls itself, it is hardly a Communist
country. , q

As was the case in the former Soviet Union ——- a
very few select elites — not ordinary citizens — are
the ones who will benefit from Bush’s veto. And
moreover, it is hardly ironic that the beneficiaries,
will be the same people who_ were responsible for
the Tienanmen Square Massacre and other notable
human rights violations.

It will simply provide even more leverage for the
elites to hold the people of this country down.

It would be nice to think that the citizens of
China would reap these benefits, but it isn’t going to
happen. Their records on human rights, free trade
and arms proliferation prove that China, not the
United States, is in the catbird seat when it comes
to negotiations between the two nations. And now
we’re going to reward them again, despite. continu-
ous violations. There is definitely something wrong
with this picture. .

A country which is home to one quarter
of the world’s population could hardly survive if it
was shut off from the rest of the world. It has neither

A the means nor the technological capabilities, even if
it were for just a short period of time. And as all
solutionsbreed new problems, American businesses
would surely suffer. ‘ V ,  V V

But we’ do not;-suggest that there isn't a trade—off.

However,-ip-ut’ .ethno._centric interests aside and ‘

Replacing the famous four letter word

- If you are offended by the
legendary “f-word,” please, I
beg of you, don’t read this col—
umn. ~

Oh — you’re still here. I
wonder why. Could it be
because the mere mention of
the “forbidden” word enticed
you to continue reading?

Thirty years ago this word,
when used in everyday conver-
sation, brought about dirty
glares, rude comments and a
slap in the face from mother. It
was always promptly followed

by a “if I ever hear that word

out of you again, I’m going to
wash your mouth out with a
bar of soap” lecture.

I remember the first time my
brother said “f—- you” to me. I
ran into the house screaming,
‘fMom, you should have heard
the bad word he said to me!”
This was when I was eight
years old — hardly old enough
to even understand the concept

. of sex, yet alone this vulgar

term.

Oops..I did it again, didn’t I?
I said it. ,Well at least I"still
have your"attention'.' It?«s";a big

historians have been pondering
this question for centuries._ Let
me add my insight as to where
I believe this word came from.
It probably originated with a
bunch of cavemen sitting
around a pile of sticks. They
were trying to get a fire started
— their attempt was in vain.
These hairy beasts (all men
of course), upon feeling dis-
couraged about their inability
to get the ﬁre started, grunted
in disappointment —- “Ug! Duh-

bog-ul—la! F——!” As one cave-
man heard this grunt he
thought to himself, “Ug. Me
heard this word before.” After
thinking long and hard about

this feeling of deja—vu, he real-

ized that it was from none
other than himself.‘

It was uttered in the heat of
passion the night before.
Hence, the birth of the f-word
and its meaning.

And today in the ‘90s, this
word is still prevalent in many
forms. This campus alone
could keep it around for the

Melissa
Kundek

next .100 years or so. We’ve all
heard it — the infamous con-

versation. “I went to this f—-‘

ing party Friday night, and it
was so f—ing lame. We went
in there and there was this guy.
He,’s;.:been f——ing with me for a
longitirne now, and I just f—-
ing ‘went up to him and told

9 . him to leave me the f—-— alone
mystery where the f-word got.”
its meaning. Philosophers and-

or I would f—— him up.” .

But can’t we use another
word — a word with no sexual
implications as an expression
of disgust, a descriptive word,
an action, etc.?

So now it is my duty and plea-

sure to introduce a new word,
a word with no meaning what-
soever — in other words, a
totally useless word that can
replace vulgarity at .a time
when one is momentarily at a
loss for words. Introducing the
one, the only, the new and
improved f-word. Only now it

is a w—word — WOZ. The ulti-
mate word. It can be used as a
noun, verb, adjective, interjec-
tion or any other part of speech
imaginable. Think about it —— I
woz, you woz, he wozzes, they
have wozzed. Woz! I forgot I

had an exam on 150 pages of I

calculus today! I was so
wozzing annoyed.

But the real problem doesn’t
lie with the word; it is in the
meaning. Woz will never take
the place of the f-word. Why? It
has no meaning. Face it.

The reason the f-word is so.
prevalent in today’s language is
because of its sexual connota-
tions. » ‘

Maybe all college students are
horny, or maybe they feel spe-
cial using a word with sexual
implications. Sex staitles peo-
ple. ,

One last thing to those of-
you who use the f-word three
times in a four-word sentence.
Did you ever realize how vul-

. gar you sound? »

Irealize that people get dis-
couraged and every once in a

fwhile slip up,__but to use this
1 word as the only word in your

vocabulary is "disgusting.

How do you think -the peo-
ple around you feel hearing
this word 40 times in a span of
15 seconds? .

My point isthat the f-word is
not quite as startling as it once
was but hearing it constantly
gets to be bothersome.

If‘ you got that out of this col‘-

umn then good, but if you.

didn’t, then woz it.

announced yesterday that he
will resume his playing career
with the L.A. Lakers next sea-

“I’m back baby,” Johnson
said. “Finally. This is a great
day for me to come back to the
family I once was apart of and
that I lost for just a year. I am
happy to be back.”

Johnson said that he plans to
play between 50 and 60 games,
play only a select number road
games in major cities‘ like
Boston and New York and
avoid back-to—back games. He
said his addiction to basketball
was too strong to resist.

“I’d ask myself, ‘Do I really

really want that?’ And I said,
‘Yeah, I want all of it.”’

He said that he came to this
decision after testing his physi-
cal condition while preparing
for the Olympics in Barcelona.

“The true test was playing
against the players in practice
on the Olympic team and
watching as I was just getting
better and better,” he said.
“Everyday my Olympic team-

‘mates would tell me that I was

coming back. ‘

“God put me on this earth to
play basketball and to do my
thing on the court,” Johnson
said. “So I’m going to do my
thing on that court.”

was a small-risk, but that if I

Johnson said. “If I was going to

wouldn’t be up here. I’d be
saying that I’rn‘still retired.

“My wife and I have been

answered our prayers and It’s

Johnson the “ok” to resume his

ance the only thing that we’ll
know is what happens in the
experiment called Earvin
Johnson.”_‘

Mellman said thatthe amount
of playing time that Earvin can
handle will probably change
from moment to moment.

Johnson realizes that his
comeback tells a greater story
than that of one man with the
HIV virus. He said that his
presence on the floor makes a
much broader statement about
the disease without saying a
word.

“I don’t have to say or do
anything. Once I hit the floor,
all the words are being spoken
because I’m out there compet-
ing, I’m out there playing and
I’m out there trying to win
games,” Johnson said.

Johnson joked with the press

I’m tired of looking at you.
Please go back. [Your family]

There will be no “farewell
tour” similar to the one given
to Laker center Kareem Abdul-
Jabaar upon his retirement. The
only tradition Johnson wishes

to continue is the wearing of

his familiar number 32. A num-
ber that the Lakers discontin-
ued upon his first announce-
ment of retirement.

“When I go out, I’ll just go
out. I think it is a lot easier on
everybody, especially the
team,” Johnson said. “I wanna
just go off into the sunset, and
then I won’t have to deal with
you guys [the press] no more.

“My number is going to stay
up there so I’m not dead by no
means. Number 32 is mine
unless they tell me otherwise.”

It may sound like I’m for

somewhat true, but if a I

play in the NHL, why
shouldn’t she play?

JC star Royster given no place on defensive line

By Mike Johns
Staff Writer

While the 1992 Panthers’ defense
is a unit made up of talented play-
ers, there certainly is always room
for improvement.

Marcus Royster, a junior college
All-American for Fullerton [Calif.]
Junior College, led his team with 65
unassisted tackles and appeared able
to provide immediate help on Pitt’s
depleted defensive line. A unit that
has los_t its two most productive

» players, Sean Gilbert and Keith

Hamilton to the pro ranks. _

Yet so far this season, Royster has
not seen any playing time for the
Panthers.

“When I was coming to Pitt, I was
billed as a quick fix to Pitt’s defen-
sive line vacancies and a person that
was going to come in and get a
chance to play right away,” Royster
said. It has not worked out that
way. Royster’s position coach
explained that his time on the bench
is attributed not to a lifék of talent
but to his lack of knowledge of Pitt’s
defensive scheme.

“In the spring he had a hard time
adjusting to our style of defense,”
defensive line coach Tom Turchetta
explained. “In junior college he was
playing a different style. That doesn’t
mean he’s not a good football play-
er, but he needs a little bit more
time to adjust to this style of‘

defense.

“Talent is not the issue with
Royster,” Turchetta said. “He is
strong as a bull. He also runs well,
but he is just behind [the starters on

,the defensive line] at this point.

There are other kids who are per-
forming just as well, and they have
the defense better understood than
he does right now.”

Turchetta said that Royster report-
ed to Pitt’s football camp late this
summer which contributed to his
lack of playing time. He will not
play until he has caught up mentally.

“[His playing time] would be deter-
mined by how much progress he
continues to make,” he said. “Also
how much ground he can close

between where he is now and the
guys that are being worked. in right
now.”

Royster, however, said that missing
camp did not put him at a great dis-
advantage because game experience
is more valuable than camp training.

“By missing some of camp, since it

"was two days, I did miss a lot of

information,” Royster said. “I don’t

THE PI'I‘T‘NEWS, Wednesday, September 30, 1992 '

Eootball under the lights goes from oddity to routine

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Playing football games
under the lights, as Pitt will
do six times this season,
has become commonplace.
It would take a truly lousy
match—up‘ for the major

attraction of a modern night ’
W football game to be the

lights themselves.

The fact that a football »

game-was played under
lights was the major draw
for the first night football
game ever. This spectacle
happened exactly 100 years

 ago this week, on‘ Sept. 28,

1892.

The site was Mansfield
University, in Mansfield,
Pa., — a small town~in the

mountains of north-centra1_

Pennsylvania. The game pit-
ted hometown Mansfield
against rival Wyoming
Seminary, also located in
central Pennsylvania.
Football was in its" infancy
during this period and vir-
tually had nothing in com-
mon with the game of foot-

ball we know today. A»
group of students who

founded Mansfield’s first
football teamlin 1891 tried
to find a way to show off

E--— STl§.>EN’i‘
<;@vERNtv1EN'r

Student Government Board

this new sport. They decid-
ed that the best way to do
this was to play a football

game as an exhibition at

the Great Mansfield Fair.

One of the oddities in the
early game was no kickoffs.
The team teams just started
to advance up the field
with the ball. Also, team-
mates were allowed to aid
ballcarriers in advancing
the ball. This would include
helping a teammate ‘up the
field or even grabbing on
to straps attached to the
player's pants and pulling
the player to gain more
yardage.

The major attraction of
the fair in 1892 was the
exhibit of the first electric
lights, which would not
actually be installed in
Mansfield for 10 more
years. This was just 13
years after Thomas Edison
invented them. The newly
formed sport of football
was shown under lights to
showcase the two attrac-
tions with one exhibit.

The game started at twi-
light, approximately 6:45
p.m.,The General Electric
Company, which provided
the lights and the genera-
tor, strung lights along the
end zones and sidelines but
oddly hung lights off of a
pole planted smack in the
middle of the field. This
served to be a dangerous
obstacle throughout the
game.

The game of football was
brutal at that time — a time
where people actually were
killed while playing in foot-
ball games. The teams
played a brutal first half
which ended in a 0-0 tie.

The lighting was very
dim, and vision got so bad
that the each team had a
hard time recognizing
which side actually had the
ball. Adding to this dilem-
ma was a field that was full
of potholes and horse
manure. The game was
called before the second
half began,‘ so the first

night game in history ended
in a scoreless tie.

To commemorate its role
in lighting the world’s first
night football game,
General Electric produced a
commercial that debuted on
Monday Night Football this
past week. The 60-second
spot is a before and after
format showing how far we
have come from the first
night football game ever to
a present night football
game .

Also commemorating this
important event in sports
history, a re-enactment of
that first game took place at
Mansfield University this
past weekend. For the pur-
poses of historical accuracy
the same rules and uni-
forms were used during a

12-minute re-enactment of ,

that first game. General

Electric even strung the-'

lights for that game right
down to installing a light
pole smack dab in the mid-
dle of the field just like it
was clone 100 years ago.

So the next time you
attend a Pitt football game
at night, remember this
piece of history. Take a
good look at the lights, and
be thankful that they are
there and allow you to see
the game. -

Because 100 years ago,
the lighting was so bad, the
players could hardly see
each other.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 30, 1992

His players know it. Pirates
management knows it.
Opposing managers know it all
too well. But in a game where
modesty is the exception to the
rule, Jim Leyland will never say
it. He doesn’t‘have to‘.

In 1985 the Pittsburgh Pirate
organization was a mess. A

with a huge void.  ' ~

Jim Leyland was virtually a
nobody in 1985, having never
progressed past double—A in his
playing career and having
served a total of one game as
major league manager. He had
acted as Tony LaRussa’s third

‘ base coach and was highly

thought of around the White .

_Sox clubhouse. But on Nov. 20, .

out-the season benefits not

organization and writers who
get the same chance to do their
job no matter the outcome.

Leyland understands the role
of the bench player, having
been one for so long. He is
not afraid to use a Gary Varsho
or a Lloyd McClendon in cru-
cial, late-inning situations. By
taking the chance on his lesser-
kused players, he continually

be a good game.”

“With each game the
team becomes more
mature, and it has made
the team better,” Furjanic
said about his team early
this season.

Pitt has to keep an eye
out for St. Francis’ for-
wards Barry Bimbi and
Billy Turner. All-North
East selection Bimbi has
nine goals and three
assists this season.

“Bimbi has been their

big gun for the last three ,

years,” Luxbacher said.
“[St. -Francis] is always a
threat with Bimbi.” ’

First—year player Turner
can also be a threat. He
has five goals and three
assists this season.

Both players are from
nearby North Allegheny
High School. Expect them
to want to make this a
special homecoming.

Like the Panthers, who
have first—year phenom
Adam Spitzer in goal, the
Red Flash’s also have a
first—year player_David
Godfrey in net. Expect
Eric Prex and company to
try to take advantage of
the newcomer.

Furjanic is also high on
the play of sophomore
sweeper Ian Briggs from

Tunapuna, Trinidad.
According to Furjanic, he
will be the key to St.
Francis’ success.

Pitt’s sophomore mid-
fielder Eric Prex leads the
charge for the Panthers.
So far Prex has five goals
this season and was
named last week’s co-
offensive player of the
week in the Big East.

“Give a [player] like
him a chance, and he’ll
put it in on you,” Furjanic
said.

But Prex isn’t the only
player the Red Flash’s

should be aware of. Brian

Pelligrino, Bob Dyer,
Carsten Bishop and
Charlie Wasson and keep-
er Adam Spitzer have
combined for four
shutouts this season as
the defensive wall.

Furjanic is not surprised
by Pitt’s early success this
season.‘

“Luxbacher knows the

‘game of soccer,” Furjanic

said. “I knew Pitt could

do well in the Big East.”

Furjanic also attributes

-Pitt’s success to the first-

year play of Spitzer, mid-
fielder Todd Graf and
defender Eric Porter.

. Pitt continues its Big

East schedule Sunday at
Georgetown.

-Speaking of

dug themselves a hole
by trading for all of
Gretzky’s Edmonton
buddies like Jari Kurri,
Paul Coffey and Charlie

these aging players, the

become so depleted of

Leyland

Continued from page 11

in any game, the various mem-
ber of the ‘pen must be pre-
pared for every situation —- be
it pitching with the bases ’
loaded in the ninth or six runs
down in the third.

It is his treatment of star
players like Andy Van Slyke
and Barry Bonds that has
endeared him to the team.
Everyone is treated the same, ’
from someone batting .320 to
s_omeone batting .120. Leyland
makes it a point to say some-

thing to each player everyday,’ '

be it a batting tip or advice on
how to finance a home.

He also takes a very laissez—_
faire approach to his club-
house, allowing players to play
cards, shoot on the miniature I
basketball goal orwatch televi-
sion. Often it is these relaxing
sessions that prepare a team
for an upcoming game or
series. ,

Thisseason has easily been
the greatest job of Leyland’s
major league managerial
career. The loss of Bobby
Bonilla to free agency hurt, but
the trade of John Smiley to the
Minnesota Twins and the
release of 1991 save leader Bill
Landrum left players wonder-
ing whether the organization
was committed to winning or
just keeping an even payroll.
Couple that with the losses of
Neal Heaton and Bob Kipper,
and he had a potential disaster
on his hands.

But instead of publicly com-
plaining‘ about management

‘Leyland had a closed door“ 1

meeting with General Manager
Ted Simmons and dealt with
the issue. ' ‘

  

 

_.

He continued to use his
bench to fill in the holes dur-
ing the season. Cecil Espy was
virtually unstoppable early in
the year, and Gary Varsho has
provided a steady replacement
throughout. It is still hard to
figure out how he used such
weak relief pitching to provide
so many victories. Stan Belinda
has been less than reliable
(and downright ugly in spurts),
and Roger Mason failed to live

‘ I up to the last two-and-a-half

months of 1991.

- Barry Bonds and Andy Van
Slyke have been their usual,
lethal selves, but apart from
them and Don Slaught, most
starters _ have experienced a
fall-off from last season —
most notably Jay Bell, Jeff King
and Orlando Merced. Leyland
has used call-ups Dave Clarke,
Tim Wakeﬁeld and Steve
Cooke to log important innings
when starters were injured or
not doing the job. He also led
the team through two disas-

trous West Coast road trips en '

route to a third divisional title.

In the locker room after the
Pirates clinched the division on
Sunday, while players doused
each other with champagne
and beer, Leyland sat alone in
his familiar rocking chair quiet-
ly answering questions for
reporters. While answering a
question he began to mention
all of the people that took part
in the effort: scouts, instructors,
minor league coaches, club-
house managers, his own staff
and players  and then he
began to

the possibility of red-shirt-
ing him if his progress
does not pick up.

“He is doing the things
we ask him to do, and he
is starting to come along,”
Turchetta said. “We talk
about it everyday, and we
watch film -on him every-
day. Hejust has to bide

.h_is; time at this point.”

_ _.If_ given an opportunity
to play, Royster‘.believes
he could be a productive
football player for the
Panthers. ‘-

“If.I got a chance to
play I would be able to
help the team,”—— he said.
“You cannot do anything
on the sideline. The most
important thing is to be
given a chance to prove
myself on the field.”

The whole-concept of
recruiting a junior-college
player is so that that play-

er can contribute to the
team immediately. A
junior-college transfer has
only two years of eligibili-
ty left so it stands to rea-
son that a coach wouldn’t
recruit him if he was not
going to play right away.

Royster agrees with this
reasoning. ,

“If a person would _‘
come out and see me
practice, I’m someone that 1
people say should be
playing,” Royster said.
“People tell me that I can
play on this level, and
that I have all the tools to
succeedff ,

At least one of his team-
mates agree.

“Royster definitely
should be playing,” fellow
teammate Marcus Harper
said. “At practice he
blows the offensive line-
men off the ball. He is
just so strong and quick.”
