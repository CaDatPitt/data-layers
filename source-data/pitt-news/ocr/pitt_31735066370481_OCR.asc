UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Rally combines music with message

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer ‘

Those who came out to Flagstaff
Hill for Friday's concert simply
looking for a day of relaxation got
more than they bargained for.

Organizers of “Rock Against
Racism" said that the event was
just the right combination of enjoy-
ing the music and sun and ex-
pressing opposition to racism.

“It was the most fun we’ve had
so far,“ said Doug Howell. a
member of Pitt’s Students for a
Free South Africa. SFSA co-
sponsored the concert, along with
CMU's Students Against Apar-
theid. "It‘s good to have fun and
work to free South Africa. and this
is deﬁnitely it. We're planning on
repeating the. event.“

Following a performance by the
rock group ATS. a political refugee
from South Africa addressed the
crowd. Zingie (as she calls herself).
called upon students to continue
working to end apartheid in South
Africa.

“You. as students, have the
future in your hands. and
therefore it is of paramount impor-
tance for you to participate in ac-
tivities that will enable you to
decide the future,“ she said. “Your
participation shows your desire to
elevate yourself above that sick
emotion of hatred of other people
because of the color of their skin."

In addition to ATS, the jazz band
Rod McCoy and Silk and the
reggae—rock band Strikers provided
a variety of musical styles. Al-
though the music was diverse. the
purpose and motivation behind it
strictly concerned divestment, as
featured speaker Dennis Brutus
pointed out.

Politics ﬁlled the air of Benedum
Auditorium Friday night as nationally
prominent speakers assessed the overall
state of the country. Endorsed by the
Faculty for Social Responsibility, the
“Planning for Peace and Prosperity"
symposium tried to evaluate the rela-
tionship between defense spending and
non-defense sectors throughout the
economy.

Michael Harrington, National Public
Radio commentator and one of two
keynote speakers, attacked government
spending for high-tech research. With
speciﬁc reference to the Vietnam War,
Harrington said, “High technology
cannot defeat a structure rooted in a
country’s society and politics.“

Harrington also attacked President
Reagan’s policies, calling for an end
to the Star Wars defense system, im-
plying that it would undermine national
security. The MX missile is of im-
mediate concern to Harrington. “The
Soviets aren’t being paranoid,” Har-
rington said, “but they are absolutely
right to be afraid of a first strike.”

In closing, Harrington also called for
an end to the militaristic actions of

- President Reagan which, in his estima-

 

 
  

Rod McCoy of the Rod McCoy and Silk Band (left) and poet Dennis Brutus, who will become
chairman of Pitt’s black studies department in September, were featured at Friday’s concert.

A South African activist—in-exile
and former political prisoner,
Brutus stressed the need for divest-
ment if apartheid is ever to end in
South Africa and called proﬁts
from South African investments
“blood money."

“Money and proﬁts made out of
racism and oppression is blood
money. and you should be ashamed
to receive it," he said, “because it
comes from the blood, suffering
and broken bodies ofthe victims of
apartheid in South Africa."

Brutus compared investing in
South Africa to ﬁnancing a bordello
or a hit man and said that to proﬁt
from any of these is “immoral.“

Also, Brutus reminded Pitt
students that the board of trustees
will meet on May 29 to decide
“what to do about receiving ‘blood
money.‘ " He urged students to
voice their opposition to Pitt's in-
vestment in South Africa.

“It is time to stop investing in op-
pression, to stop proﬁting in apar-

theid," he said, “and to stop
receiving blood money."

Following Brutus‘ address.
Howell urged students from both
Pitt and CMU to sign petitions
urging the universities to sell all
stocks in South African-related
companies. The most recent infor-
mation released indicated that Pitt
has approximately $19 million in-
vested in South African-related
companies. Howell also urged Pitt
students to attend a rally for divest-
ment on May 29.

3 students
stabbed on
Semple St.

By Craig Pearson
For The Pitt News

Three Pitt students were stabbed dur-
ing a ﬁght on Semple Street. according
to a police report.

Todd Jackson. who sustained stab
wounds to the back as well as contu-
sions and abrasions, was taken to Mer-
cy Hospital by city paramedics, the
report stated. Mercy Hospital ofﬁcials
would not release information regard-
ing Jackson's condition.

The second victim, Percy White,
was stabbed in the chest and back and
was taken to Presbyterian-University
Hospital along with Patrick Anyanwu—
Ebo. Anyanwu-Ebo suffered injuries to
the chest and buttocks. Both are listed
in fair condition, according to a
hospital spokesman. According to the
report, the incident occurred as the vic-
tims were on their way to buy beer.
Two cars containing approximately six
males drove by the victims and parked
in the area of Semple and Ward streets.
One of the unidentiﬁed Pitt students ap-
proached Jackson and punched him in
the face. The ﬁght ensued, and during
it. the victims were injured. The
assailants ﬂed south on Semple.,The
vehicles are believed to be a white
Chrysler Newport and a brown
Oldsmobile.

The police do have a probable sus-
pect and have a warrant for the sus-
pect‘s arrest. However, they are still
seeking the suspect’s address, the
report stated.

peace groups make plans for prosperity

tion, are threatening global security and
world peace.

The evening’s second featured
speaker was Ann Markusen, an
authority on regional economic
development and national defense. In
linking the two, Markusen blamed
many of this area's problems on the
way government funds are spent. Ac-
cording to Mardusen, the govemment’s
huge research projects have caused a
forced migration of workers. By this
Markusen meant that the brightest
minds and their research funds headed
for Silicon Valley and other techno-
logical hotbeds. This has left the in-
dustrial “Rust Belt” states, such as
Pennsylvania, out in the cold
technologically.

On a more positive note, Markusen
said that defense spending does create
jobs. According to her, -though, the
problem lies in the type of jobs it
creates. Markusen cited ﬁgures that
showed jobs were readily available for
those with technical college degrees.
However, the
America erodes when the end products
of this research aren’t produced on a
large scale. As a result, the Japanese
are taking our high-tech research and
turning it into workable products, thus
capturing the market.

ing sectors of the United States is of

The local citizens had a chance to
participate in more in—depth discussions
at the roundtable workshops held Satur-
day morning at the YWCA in down-
town Pittsburgh. The workshops in-
cluded topics such as the federal budget
and how it affects Pittsburgh; Penn-
sylvania economic planning and the
conversion of military industries; social
vs. military spending: the impact on the
black community; and the Steel Valley

Authority and job production. The .

workshops were each headed by
specialists in the various areas
discussed.

In the Pennsylvania economic plan-
ning workshop, Rep. Alan Kukovich
(D-Greensburg), talked 'about the
House bill No. 2097. This bill will
establish the Pennsylvania Economic
and Infrastructure Development Board,
to be responsible for implementing
developmental strategies for Penn-
sylvania. l(ukovich,urged the people to
show their support for the bill.

Dr. Jake Milliones, president of
Pittsburgh’s Board of Public Education
was also present to discuss the impact
of military spending on the black com-

military spending has greatly increased.
social security has slightly increased,
and education has decreased over the
past four years.

“I support social security, but the
money that is available for it should not
be at the expense of the children." said
Milliones, “but rather, at the expense
of the national defense.”

Milliones talked about many of
Reagan’s proposals, such as his sup-
port of private education, and the way

this hurts blacks and minorities.

The workshops and the entire con-
ference were sponsored primarily by
the Coalition to Prevent Nuclear War.
The tone of the conference can be
summed up by co—chairman Jerald
Starr when he said, “Our government
is a bunch of flabby hysterics who
should be put out to pasture as soon as
possible. We need to build a coalition
of working class people, black and
white."

Deaf awareness urged

Pitt will hold its third annual Deaf Awareness Day today from 1 to 4
p.m. in the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

Sponsored by the university's Sign Connection, the event will feature
displays and activities of 25 organizations including books, video tapes
and equipment for and about deaf people. Personalities will include Miss
Deaf Pennsylvania, New York Jets’ player Troy Benson and the signing
groups Signwaves, Beautiful Hands and Breakthrough.

Deaf Awareness Day attempts to bridge the gap between the deaf and
hearing community. The event educates the hearing community about the
problems of the deaf and shows what the deaf community has to offer.

The Sign Connection is a student organization at Pitt that promotes the
use of signing and the awareness of deaf issues.

In closing. Markusen added that in- munity. Milliones reviewed how

Police

WEST BERLIN -— A special squad
of 100 West Berlin police is inves-
tigating Saturday’s bombing of a night-
club crowded with 500 people. A West
German newspaper said security of-
ficials believe Libya was involved in
the attack, which killed an American
soldier and a Turkish woman. More
than 200 people suffered injuries. The
newspaper quoted unidentified West
German officials who said the bomb-
ing was part of a campaign of venge-
ance against the United States for the
recent military confrontation in the
Gulf of Sidra.

Tonga islander
continues seige

Texas -— A 27-year-old Paciﬁc Is-
lander from Tonga continues to hold
his ex—wife hostage in a convenience
store located between Dallas and Fort
Worth. The situation began more than
36 hours ago. The gunman has made
no demands. Bystanders are expressing
the need for action. During a similar
stand—off in Arlington, Texas, earlier
this year, dozens of bystanders outside
a convenience store cheered as a man
holding a hostage shot himself in the
head. The shooting was broadcast live
by a television station.

Mandela outspoken
against apartheid

JOI-IANNESBURG — Black South
African dissident Winnie Mandela
followed Saturday’s outspoken call for
action against apartheid with an interview
published yesterday by the Johannesburg
Sunday Star. The newspaper is court-
ing possible prosecution for quoting a
“banned” person, but it argues that it
is protected by recent legal rulings
against such censorship. In the inter-
view, Mandela accused the United
States and Britain of backing South
African government officials whom she
called “terrorists.” She called for in-
ternational sanctions against Pretoria.

Britain against
Protestant violence

Britain —— Britain’s minister for North-
ern Ireland has a tough warning for
Protestant extremists who launched a
recent wave of violence. Secretary
Tom King said the British government
is prepared to send in troop reinforce-
ments to support police. In the most re-
cent incidents, Protestants attacked the
homes of 16 police officers and fought

street battles with police and firefight-
ers. It is a part of a Protestant campaign
against an Anglo-Irish agreement giv-
ing the Irish Republic a say in Northern
Ireland’s government.

Airlines to
test employees

WASHINGTON —— New federal
rules going into effect Wednesday will
require airline pilots, ﬂight engineers
and cabin attendants to undergo a blood
test if they are suspected of being im-
paired by alcohol while working. The
new blood—alcohol standard is tougher
than the standard for motorists. It also
supplements the so-called “bottle to
throttle” regulation that prohibits
drinking by crew members eight hours
before a flight.

Under 21

Despite efforts by state and local government agen-
cies, underage drinking remains a problem in the
Oakland area. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board
has stepped up their patrols, and, in turn, the bars have
tightened their own security. However, the problem re-
mains. Underage drinkers have sidestepped the laws by
falsifying their driver's licenses. Some of the methods
are virtually impossible to detect and ultimately the bars
shoulder the blame. The state has proposed new laws
that would transfer the penalty from the bar owners to
the offenders, but even those new laws will not deter
underage drinkers. .

There must be an alternate way of dealing with the
problem. Perhaps if the underage drinkers were given
an alternative to the bars, they would not frequent the
establishments. Currently the underage students at Pitt
have no such choice. There is no place for these students
to socialize or dance that does not serve liquor. Other
universities offer nightclubs that cater to underage
students.

However, this solution may not be workable at the
University of Pittsburgh. With the numerous bars in the
area, perhaps the best way to curb the underage drink-
ing problem — and still provide those students with a
place to relax — would be to have some bars allow
underagers into their establishments. They could stamp
the hands of those people and, subsequently, they would
not be served by the bartender. Of course, there are
problems with this plan. Many bartenders may be too
busy to check for the stamps, and the.underage drinkers
will get served. However, many under-21 students just
want to go to bars to socialize. They might not even
want to drink, but they should be allowed to participate
in Oakland’s social life. No one can stop young people
from drinking, but perhaps if more alternatives were
available the desire for liquor would be lessened.

Safety First

I feel really bad for that girl who got
run over trying to cross the street. at
the light, between buildings at her
school. But it makes my blood boil to
see the university pretend there is no
problem. No more excuses: This is a
great wrong. This goes straight to
President Posvar, this is the students’
safety at the university. All we want is
the right to cross the street to our
classes without competition from turn-
ing cars. That is not asking much,
while a girl lies seriously injured in a
hospital bed. They‘re doing lots of nice
improvements to the university for the
big 200th anniversary. That’s great, but
the most important improvement is to
just let us cross without the continual

.hassles and tension from trafﬁc.

The worst part is that they could do
it easily. Pitt gets every waiver and
zoning change it wants for new
research buildings, they get away with
third party real estate deals, but they
refuse to rufﬂe any feathers downtown
to ask for this simple, important
change. The walk signs all around the
Cathedral of Learning, the centerpiece
and main building of this great school.
are all “ﬂashing" walk signs. This
forces students and cars to try to get
through the intersection at the same
time. This is an abomination; since my
freshman year, I have seen several

small but vocal Oakland community 1

groups get the city to put in real, full
stop/walk signs for their people first at
Craig Street and Fifth Avenue, and
now at Meyran and Fifth avenues, both
only one block away from the
Cathedral. and yet, the mighty Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, with all we mean to
the community, cannot get a walk sign
for its students? This is a scandal. Is
Pitt such a laughing stock‘? The
Oakland people's argument was that
the streets were not safe for people to
try to run across, with their high
population of older, handicapped and
injured people. But one block away,
Pitt and the city continue to put up the
same lying argument: “Putting in full
stop/walk signs would throw off the
traffic flow on Fifth Avenue." This
makes me sick. The Oakland groups
don't have anywhere near the weight
of the university. and they got the traf-
fic stopped right in the heart of
Oakland, they even got a whole new
stop light put in with the walk sign at
Meyran Avenue. I submit that Pitt has
not asked the city, has not put up any
pressure on behalf of its students. They
are reluctant to use up this political
favor just for students, rather than on
some developmental plan, but damn it,
this costs nothing: Give us the basic
protection of full stop/walk signs
around the Cathedral at Bellefield

Avenue, Bigelow Boulevard and
Forbes Avenue.
After four years. my school means
a great deal to me, and I'm happy for
all the unbelievable growth I‘ve seen
since '82. But when President Posvar
welcomes visitors here for the 200th
anniversary. I’d like to see him try to
take them across the street to show
them around, on any weekday morn-
ing or afternoon. What an embarrass-
ment. having dignitaries run like eat-
tle across Fifth Avenue. The president
will be remembered for the huge strides
that Pitt has made, there will be a
Posvar Hall or Posvar Towers. and
rightfully so. But I would like him. and
I bet he would like. to be remembered
as a president who cared about his
students. Damn it, make those signs
stop ﬂashing; no more kids in the
hospital.

Open Minds

Bravo to Stephen Morrison. It is so
rare that one hears the sounds of open
inquiry in political discourse. The
university press is more commonly the
home of the tiresome recitations of
ideologues. Mr. Morrison‘s column
addressing the tragedy of South Africa
is sure to be attacked as everything
from racist to just plain wrong-headed.
An open mind is always an easy target
in a climate of moral self-n'ghteousness.

Mr. Morrison recognizes that it is
morally imperative to hasten the end of
apartheid, and yet he does not allow
himself to be swept away by the dogma
of the true believers. That is, the pol-
itically religious, who hold feverishly
to a credo firmly rooted in little but
faith. Stephen seems to be evaluating
a proposed solution to a problem in

plicity. equity and the clarity of goals.
Mr. Morrison also examines the pos-
sibility of unanticipated consequences
of the proposal that might prove to be
deleterious. Through this process of
thoughtful and well reasoned inquiry,
he manages to alienate himself as a
heretic.

The problem is that there is no longer
room for open dialogue in political
forums. On the contrary, political
discourse continues to sound increas-
ingly like a monologue. There was a
time when people felt that the public
interest was not some pre-existing
platonic idea, rather it emerged from
differences of opinion being reasonably
propounded. There was a time when
a person entered a dialogue unafraid to
change his mind, for changing one‘s
mind was a sign of having learned
something.

Young people today find that they
study issues not with the disinterest-
edness of a disciplined imagination.

tions. Whether right-wing or left, stu-
dents are pressured to take a position
and learn the necessary credo to recite
in the face of an adversary. There is
no room for doubt in the new church.
I mourn the passing of those like
Stephen Morrison. Those few who
hold to those old-fashioned ideas of
liberalism. There is no room for the
voice of quiet reason in the age of
religious certainty. There is no room
for the voice which is being drowned
out by the shrill polemics of those who
hate to hear that things might not be as

Choices

I would like to respond to the Letter
to the Editor, “Pro-Choicers Chal-
lenged" (The Pitt News, March 24). I
would like to make it clear from the
beginning of this letter that I was also
at the pro-choice march. I am pro-
choice, not pro—abortion or anti-
abortion. I attended the march because
of my commitment to pro-choice.

The letter in question spent quite a
few paragraphs explaining to all of us
what an abortion was like. I think that
most of us have seen the pictures or
heard the graphic details surrounding
the abortion issue. I also believe that
most people are committed to their
choice of having an abortion or not
having an abortion. The real issue.
which is what the writer never dealt
with, is choice.

Our writer made it clear that he
believes abortion is murder. Therefore.
he didn't want to have anything to do
with abortion. It seems that the writer
has made some choices based on sound
personal experience. I would suggest
that the writer of the letter not have an
abortion. Also, as a person in the
medical field, refuse to perform an
abortion. It's the writers choice.

I am “big“ enough to give the writer
the choice to make a sound commit-
ment against abortion. What I want
from the writer and our government is
the choice that I am willing to give to
the writer. I want the choice to do with
my body what I want.

The main issue surrounding The
March For Women's Lives is the fact
that the Reagan administration has in-
stituted policies that are trying to tell
women in particular. but also men.
what to do with their bodies. If the
Reagan administration is successful. all
of us will lose our rights to choose what
we feel is best for our bodies.

There is one final thing that I would
like to share with the writer of the let-
ter: The one thing that I learned from
the march is that if you're against abor-
tion —- fine. Don't have an abortion!
But, don't deny me the choice that I’m
willing to give to you! Keep your anti-
choice laws off my body!"

Nuclear Humiliation

What do the United Nations, the
U.S. Congress, the Soviet Union and
tha majority of our European allies
have in common? Perhaps only one
thing. They have all been demanding
that the Reagan administration get off
its collective ass and negotiate a com-
prehensive ban on nuclear testing. All
this pressure has put the administration
right up against the wall. What do you
do when the whole world -— except for
England and France — is opposed to
your policy of nuclear expansionism?
What do you do when the Soviet Union
steals the propaganda advantage by
undertaking an eight-month unilateral
moratorium? What do you do when
every nuclear explosion you set off
underlines the hypocrisy of your claims
to be working towards arms reduction?
What do you do when even your own
Congress is threatening to halt funding
for your testing program?

Well, here's what the administration
did. First, they announced a new
testing veriﬁcation procedure, so that
they can keep track of what the Soviets
are up to. Mind you this supposedly
"new” system has been around for

years -- since the mid—70s in fact -
but that doesn't matter. There is only
one group of people more ignorant on
matters of nuclear testing than Reagan
and his cronies, and that’s the general
public —— which Reagan takes as an ex-
cuse for dishing up any old lies that
might help whitewash his stubbornly
uncooperative stance.

The next step was to use this old/new
system to press the Soviets for ratiﬁca-
tion of two existing testing treaties. Of
course, it’s our own Senate, not the
Soviet Union, that hasn’t ratiﬁed these
treaties, but that’s just history. After
all, there’s nothing quite so irrelevant
to Reagan’s disingenuous politicking as
historical fact. What are these treaties
Reagan wants to ratify? Well, they’re
the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty
and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explo-
sion Treaty. Both these treaties limit
testing to 150 kilotons or less. In-
terestingly enough, neither side wants
or needs warheads more powerful than
150 kilotons. Very crafty, Mr. Reagan.
Why don ’t we get together with the
Soviets so that we can ratify two
treaties that both sides have been ob-

serving anyway? Mr. Reagan thinks --
or at least wants us to be fooled into
thinking —— that this is progress. Forget
about the Soviets’ call for an immediate
end to all nuclear testing. Let’s just
ratify some old treaties that neither side
is breaking and neither side is planning
to break. This is Reagan’s answer to
the concerned world. How humiliating.

The third and final step was to invite
the Soviets to come and observe the
next U.S. test. The Soviets undertake
an eight-month unilateral moratorium,
hoping that we will do the same. In-
stead, Reagan invites them to come and
watch our testing. Maybe this is what
he means by “engaging the Soviets in
a constructive dialogue."

It's a pity that while Reagan was in
the business of dredging up red her-
rings. he didn’t read a few of the other
existing treaties. Like, for example, the
1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty. which re-
quires the superpowers to immediately
begin negotiations for a comprehensive
test ban.

The result is that in his pathetic at-
tempt to avoid, at any cost, ending his
cherished nuclear buildup. Reagan ac-

The longer the Reagan administra-
tion continues it policy of deliberately
rejecting the continual Soviet calls for
a nuclear test ban —~ thereby rejecting
the very idea of ending the arms race
— the more the Soviet Union increases
it ill-gotten prestige as the only super-
power which seems to want peace.
Reagan is clearly worried about this
propaganda advantage but refuses to
make the obvious move — that is to
beat the Soviets at their own game.
Even this week Gorbachev announces
that he will meet immediately with the
president anywhere in Europe to
discuss a ban on all nuclear testing.
Reagan, however, in his inﬁnite lack
of wisdom, refuses ~— but he knows,
and the rest of the world knows, that
he has no good excuse. With his puerile
and confrontational attitude he earns
the scorn and increasingly the contempt
of the world community, which, in the
zero—sum game of superpower politics,
translates into gain for the Soviets. It
is about time that Reagan began to
match ongoing Soviet “peace offen-
sive” with some genuine, constructive
peace proposals of his own.

The Gregg Smith Singers to headline concert

By David Zuchowski
Staff Writer

The Gregg Smith Singers, the most-
recorded professional chorus in the
world, will perform tonight at 8 p.m.
at a concert of the Pittsburgh New
Music Ensemble in Chatham College’s
Campell Memorial Chapel.

The Gregg Smith Singers have re-
corded more than 50 albums and are

known for their remarkable discipline
and ensemble sound. They are regard-
ed as pioneers in imaginative program—
ming and in the presentation of new
music. One of their most important in—

novations has been the introduction of

‘ ‘muIti—dimensi0naI sound presentation"
into each concert performance. The

singers are positioned in groups of

various sizes in all parts of the audi-
torium, producing what the Wash-
ington‘Star has described as a “stereo

Civil War music featured

“The Blues and the Grays," a program
of Civil War music, will be presented by
the Dear Friends musical ensemble at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Auditorium at
2:30 p.ni. Sunday. April 13.

In this final concert of their current
season, the Dear Friends will feature music
from both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.
Included will be fervent rallying cries (“Ral-
ly ‘Round the Flag"). typical soldiers‘ com-
plaints (“Army Beans") and poignant songs
of loneliness and death (“Just Before the
Battle. Mother").

“The terrible and dramatic events of the
Civil War were memorialized. as at no other
time, in popular songs which seemed to be

tuned to the pulse of the people,“ said Deane
Root. curator of the Foster Memorial where
the Dear Friends are in residence.

The Dear Friends have recently returned
from Washington, D.C.. where the group
presented a concert at the Smithsonian ln~
stitute. The concert was televised by the
United States Information Agency for
overseas broadcast and was broadcast as
well by the Voice of America. The group
specializes in 19th century American music.

Members of the ensemble who will be
performing the Civil War program are Jean
Thomas. artistic director and Ilutist; Kate
Young. me1.zo—soprano; James Ferla, guitar;
Mark Graf. piano; and Rick Walker, tenor.

Pitt uarterback John Comgemi has grabbed an earld in the battle with

Dave Hooker/TheMPitt News

junior college transfer Sal Genilla for the starting quarterback job.

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

John Congemi makes the most of his
opportunities.

In 1983, as a sophomore back-up
quarterback, Congemi watched Pitt
starting quarterback John Cummings
suffer a broken collarbone during the
ﬁnal play of Pitt’s 13-3 season-opening
win over Tennessee. He then stepped
in and started for three straight years
under former coach Foge Fazio.

Congemi received another oppor-
tunity this spring when he was granted
an extra year of eligibility by the
NCAA, and he, once again, seems to
be making the most of it. Congemi
sparkled in an intrasquad scrimmage at
Pitt Stadium Saturday morning and
seems to be solidifying himself as the
leading candidate to be Pitt’s starting
quarterback next fall.

“It is hard to say ’til I see the ﬁlm,"
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
said,‘ ‘but I thought John Congemi did
a real good job. Probably, if there is
an edge right now, it is his. He got
most of the work.”

Yes, he did. Congemi completed 10
of 21 passes on Saturday for 241 yards
and two touchdowns, a 55-yard strike
to fullback Tom Brown and a 47-yarder
to receiver Darrin Gillaspie.

He and the rest of the Panthers seem
to be adjusting well to Gottfried’s new
system, especially on offense, where
the big stats were produced by some
new faces.

Gillaspie, a redshirt freshman from
Dallas, Texas, led the way, grabbing
eight passes for 107 yards.

“He played really well," Gottfried
said. “He is a young guy that is matur-
ing all the time. He is a good player,
and the more work he gets, the better
he is going to be.”

The Pitt News, April 7, 1986

L Congemi takes lead in quarterback derby

The passing game was a big question
mark entering spring drills for Gott-
fried. He had not decided who his
quarterback would be, Congemi or Sal
Genilla, and the receiving corps was
shallow. Now, with the re-emergence
of Congemi and the development of the
receivers, Gottfried can rest a little
easier.

The same goes for the defense. After
installing the new 4-3 alignment, Gott-
fried knew there would be an adjust-
ment, but he did not know how long
it would take. Fortunately for him, it
has gone more smoothly than expected.

“Defensively, I really feel we are
ahead,” Gottfried said. “We still have
some cracks to ﬁll, but there is con- ~
stant improvement —- we are getting
better all the time."

One area that stands out is the defen-
sive line, anchored by senior Tony
Woods. It is one of the few areas where
Gottfried has depth, and he plans to
take advantage of the situation next fall.

“The pass rush has been good,"
Gottfried said. “We have a very good
defensive front. The‘ thing we will have
to do is play a lot of people and keep
evervbodv fresh."

Pitt has now reached the halfway
point of spring drills. Gottfried has
eight practices and two spring games ,
remaining. He has been happy overall
with how spring drills have gone.

“We are at the exact midway point,"
Gottfried proclaimed, “and I think we
have accomplished what we wanted [up
to] this point."

However, the Panthers do have a
long way to go. It is a long road back
from two consecutive mediocre
seasons.

“Everyone is still trying to learn,"
Gottfried said. “I think you will see a
bigger difference at the last practice
than you did today."

Pitt’s defense: The Year of the Fox

By Tom Danyluk
Staff Writer

If the famous Scottish poet Robert
Burns were alive today, his poem “To
a Mouse” might have a slightly dif-
ferent twist to it. Something like, “The
best-laid defenses of Foge and friends
were often led astray.“

Too many teams have plowed Pitt's
ﬁeld since the departure of Jackie Sher-
rill, so 1985 proved to be the fourth and
last season for Seraﬁno Fazio and his
chicken-fence style of football. This
year belongs to pass~happy Mike Gott-
fried, the ex-Kansas ﬁeld general who
heard the cry “Go East" in his search
for a national championship. This
season the Pitt Panthers will have a
high—tech “run and shoot" offense,
similar to the one devised by the in-
famous Mouse Davis of USFL fame.
But football games are won on both
sides of the ball, which means there
will also be a need for defensive
renovation atop cardiac hill. Gottfried,
as people tend to forget, has brought
a whole new staff with him from the
plains of Kansas to help with the dirty

work, which means he's not the only
guy blowing the whistle at practice and
mulling over miles of game ﬁlm each
evening.

No, teams do not live by the pass
alone, as the NFL Chargers and Dol-
phins will attest. Someone’s got to try

press of the USFL and, hey. there’s
just no end to it. Anyway, the 31-year-
old Fox is now at Pitt, trying to turn
a porous defensive excuse, whose
overall efforts were about as futile as
a game of hackey-sack, into a fortiﬁed
blitzkrieg outﬁt of which even Rom-

average of 315 yards per game to their
ll opponents last season, with 207.5
of those yards coming through the air.
Fox obviously has a lot of funneling to
do before the team's opener against
Maryland.

The Fox has instructed some of the

“All I know is that we '11 be an extremely aggressive, hard-hitting defensive team come
September. The talent is deﬁnitely here at Pitt. We just need to ﬁmnel it in the right

directions. ”

— Pitt defensive coordinator John Fox

and stop the other fellow‘s run if by
land, six if by air. That's why the Pan-
ther 1986 highlight ﬁlm, with a half
serious apology to the sacred devisers
of the Chinese calendar, could easily
be entitled “The Year of the Fox.”
Panther defensive coordinator and
defensive backﬁeld coach John Fox has
built his road to success right across
America. From a steady defensive back
with San Diego State in 1975, to an
Aztec assistant, to U.S. International,
to Boise State, to Long Beach, to Utah,
to Kansas, to Iowa State, to the LA Ex-

mel himself would be proud.

“I haven’t been able to review the
ﬁlms from last year, so I can‘t pass
any judgment on the previous situa-
tion," said Fox after a practice last
week. “All I know is that we’ll be an
extremely aggressive, hard—hitting
defensive team come September. The
talent is deﬁnitely here at Pitt. We just
need to funnel it in the right direc-
tions."

The talent certainly is there. But this
same talent under the Fazio pseudo-
regime peacefully white ﬂagged an

best football players in America while
compiling a coaching resume that sounds
more like a prospective Willie Nelson
tour. Professional kamikazies like Ver-
non Dean, Ten’y Jackson, Herman Ed-
wards and Rick Woods were all under
the direction of this strategist at one
point in their college careers.

He was sharp enough to be chosen
by then head coach John Hadl of the
Express as a defensive pedagogue. Fox
had this to say about the ﬂoundering
league:

“The owners had a good original

concept. The spring football idea was
directed at the fans who were addicts,
who couldn‘t get enough football in
their system. There are deﬁnitely
enough talented players available for
the league to be successful. Then some
of the owners started spending millions
on individual players, trying to prepare
their speciﬁc teams for a merger with
the NFL. It‘s just an anti-trust league
at this stage." He sensed the disorder
within the league and bailed out after
a year and a half, rejoining the Kansas
staff under Gottfried.

Let’s see now. Fox comes from Kan-
sas. Kansas is in the Big Eight (where
mathematics is understood to be Okla-.
homa plus Nebraska equals Eight mi-
nus some ﬁne academic institutions).
Fox is now in Western Pennsylvania,
a location somewhere between 02 and
“I wish I were in Lawrence." Well
what do you know, no more annual
head-on collisions with the Sooners or
Cornhuskers, neither on the artiﬁcial
turf nor in the homes of blue-chip
recruits. Tell us, Mr. Fox, how do
you spell relief?

As I see it

By Jim Brueckner

Japan bombs out; baseball wins

It is Dec. 8, I941.

This is not your typical Monday
morning. A mere 24 hours ago. the
Japatiese attacked Pearl Harbor. The
death oi" 2.335 servicemen means on-
I_\ one thing war. A long and bitter
war.

A saddened old man sits on a bench
outside the local market. In his lap lies
a tolded newpaper which he has just
linislied. He still caimot believe his
e_\ es. He has seen a lot in his litetinie.
Ile has been witness to a great iiiaii_\
triumphs and tragedies, But Iliis. he
believes. is the most tragic happening
ol all.

In a short while. he will hear the
totals. The Japanese attack lasted less
than two hours. But in that short span
oi tmie. the) sank or destroyed I8
ships. including two niaior battleships.
the Ari/ona and the ()klahonia. The)
haxe also demolished 188 planes and
damaged an additional 159. This. in ad-
dition to the loss ot"2.335 lives. has left
a nation in mourning.

Widows. holding their now-t‘ather-
less babes in arms. will never again
hold their husbands. Mothers weep and
repeat over and over. “Why m_\' son‘?
He was such a good boy." Friends
reminisce. still in shock. and now begin
to question their own mortality.

The old man sheds a tear.

As the mourning fades. panic takes
its place. Alter witnessing the blitzkrieg

at Pearl Harbor. the United States is not
wasting any time. Troops are being
mobilized and sent oft‘ to war. Fear
grips the heart as family and friends
watch the young men leave. many
never to return.

Audie Murphy has yet to see his 18th
birthday. Little does America know
that the man who will prove to be the
greatest combat soldier who e\ er lived
is on a larm in Texas.

Americans have no idea olthe heroic
exploits to come lrom Murphy and
others. When a war breaks out. there
is no thought ol heroism. There is one
thought that clouds the mind. l)e'.ith.
l)catli is soon to come to Illitll)
.»\iiiei‘icaiis at the haiids oi‘ the Axis
|ltl\\'L‘I‘\.

The old man suddenl_\ leels the

l)ecember wind grow sharper and

colder.

As he glances up the street. the old
man sees two _voung men enter the
market. Thc_\' seem to be there tor no
reason. just wandering. They seem to
be distracted. Everyone seems dis-
tracted. Strangers stop in the streets and
look at one another. wondering if one
day they'll be comrades. sharing a
bunker.

As the two young men leave the
market. the newsstand lies just outside
the door. The_v‘ve seen the headlines
before. yet they stop and stare. It is as
it they are waiting to awake from this

"Totally by surprise. We never
stood a chance." said the one.

The other shakes his head in dis-
beliet‘. He cannot believe how much so
many lives can be altered by the actions
ota little more than one hour. Just last
month. his wile gave birth to their lirst
son. Now there looms the possibility
oi his being separated lirom this new
bundle oi" lite and cast into a world ol‘
destruction and death.

The new lather chuckles.

it, too.”

“Well, he did deserve it."

“No way. I’m telling you, Ted
Williams got robbed!”

“Tell me that you don’t think that
The Clipper’s record will stand
forever.”

“All right, so he hit in 56 con-
secutive games. OK, so no one will
ever do it again. But what about
Williams? He hit over .400, won the
batting title, led the league in homeruns
and finished with 120 RBIs. If he had
gotten just a few more RBIs, he'd have
won the Triple Crown!"

“Hmmm, a few more RBIs, huh?
Who was it that led the league with
those 125 RBIs, not to mention, set an
unbreakable record?"

“Yeah. I know, it was DiMa in

The Pitt News, April 7, 1986

But still, think about it. Williams came
that‘close to winning the Triple Crown.
The Triple Crown.’ He outhit DiMag-
gio by almost 50 points!”

“Well, maybe you're right  I
guess you are.”

The old man has been listening. He
seems to have found life again. He feels
the blood surging in his veins. He
listens further.

“Speaking of hitting, what about that
Pete Reiser? He won a batting title in
his first season. He‘s only 22 years
old!"

“My grandfather said that he’s seen
a lot of guys come in with a bang and
five years later. nobody even remeiii—
bers him.“

“That's true. I hear the Cardinals
have a new kid that they're impressed
with."

“Yeah, some guy by the name of

Musial. I heard about him, too. He‘s
supposed to be from Pennsylvania."

“He played about 10 or l2 games
last year, and they might be making
him a regular this season.“

“Well, well see."

Something has happened to the old
man. Somewhere in the dark despair

of war, he has found a torch. It is a
torch that he had been carrying all
along, but he had forgotten to light it
when the road grew dark. Suddenly,
the December air isn't so cold. There
is a magical warmth.

Nothing has been solved. But for a
few minutes, the grim reality of war
has been easier to deal with, easier to
face. ‘

A smile emerges on the old man's
lips.

Over the next four years, the fighting
on the four fronts will claim the lives
of many. The "day that will live in in-
famy" has drastically altered the lives
of every American.

But for now, it is as if a thunderstorm
has crashed into the desert. The dryness
and torridity will return. But for now,
there is relief.

Diamonds are not only a girl's best
friend but the old man‘s as well.

The old man began the day saddened
and may very well return to that
sadness tomorrow. But for a brief mo-
ment. however brief. his spirit has been
lifted. And for that moment. there is
peace in the old man's heart.
