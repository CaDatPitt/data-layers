ELECTION 2012

Romney, Obama tailor
messages to suit target
demographics

Gideon Bradshaw
Stzﬁ" Wrz'ter

With polls promising a close race
between the two presidential can-
didates on election night, both
candidates’ respective campaigns
have struggled to gain voters in
order to get any possible edge
over the competition.

President Barack Obama and
his challenger, Republican candi-
date Mitt Romney, have adopted
distinctive strategies to wrangle
in voters for the stretch run, ac-
cording to political experts and
supporters of both parties. While
Obama appears to be following
a similar strategy to the 2008

election, in which he worked to '

register and mobilize new vot-
ers, Romney is seeking to lure vot-
ing demographics ﬁrmly held by
Obama in the previous election.
Gerald Shuster, a Pitt instruc-
tor of political communication
and presidential rhetoric, ex-
plained Romney’s strategy. Ac-
cording to Shuster, female and
young voters proved instrumental
for the president during the 2008
election. In recent days, Romney
has aimed to expand his appeal
in order to attract working-class
Democrats as well as Republicans.
Shuster also said that the for-
mer Massachusetts governor has
been “working overtime” in or-
der to take votes that belonged to
Obama in the last election away
from the president this time
around. According to recent polls,
Shuster said, gaining those demo-
graphics may be all it will take for
Romney to win the presidency.
“I don’t think [Obama] has

    

, istration. I . 

   on/‘eesn  

achieved the same electric sup-
port among the youth as during
his ﬁrst campaign in 2008,” Shus-
ter said. . 1,

Billy Pitman, Pennsylvania
communications director for the
Republican National Committee,
said that Romney’s proposed eco-
nomic policies, through which he
has promised to create 12 million
new jobs, has resonated with
young voters, who have witnessed
a shrinking job market over the
last several years.

He also expects that many
Democrats will choose Romney
over the president because they
attribute the recentyeconomic
downturn to the current admin-

“The message [Romney]
brings really appeals to voters all

- across the board,” he said.

As evidence, Pitman said that
during the primaries, 100,000
registered Democrats in south-
western Pennsylvania — an area
that, unlike the state’s center, has
historically favored Democratic -
candidates — chose to cast their

ballots without marking the name

of the president, who was running
uncontested for the Democratic
nomination.

For Pitman, the “war on coal”
-— as many critical of the Obama
administration’s_ environmental
regulations have called the recent-
ly enacted policies — has led to
thinning support for the president
inthe region. According to these
critics, the emissions regulations
have cost workers jobs due to the
closure of plants that burn coal

and also hurt the coal industry itself.

In order to spread Romney’s message,
the Pennsylvania campaign has used staff
and volunteers to reach both strong sup-
porters and those who are wavering.

But Democrats remain optimistic. Matt
Mittenthal, the Obama campaign secre-
tary for western Pennsylvania, said that
Obama’s campaign intends to turn out more
sporadic voters — those who vote occa-
sionally —— than Romney’s.

In order to reach these sporadic voters, A

Mittenthal said that the campaign has used
phone banks and canvassing in order to
make sure that all of Obama’s potential
supporters turn out.

Because of the campaign’s reliance on
volunteers and localized efforts, he called

October 31, 2012 I The Pitt News I wv\/\/vpittnevveeem

it “the largest grassroots movement in his-
tory.”

The campaign has also focused on reg-
istering new voters, Mittenthal said, cit-
ing an Oct. 24 statement issued byjeremy

K Bird, the Obama campaign’s national ﬁeld

director.

“The plan we’ve been building from the
beginning is modeled exactly for this ——- to
broaden the electorate and make sure as
many Americans as possible have a chance
to take part in this historic election,” Bird
said in the statement.

Mittenthal said that over the last three .

months, 46,111 new Democratic voters have
registered, compared to 26,150 newly reg-
istered Republicans.

When asked about these statistics, Pit-
man said that the Republican campaign
has not focused on registering new voters.

“Our focus has always been on iden-
tifying the voters who are likely to vote

ON CAMPUS

for us and turning them out to the polls,”
Pitman said.

Casey Rankin, president of Pitt College ‘

Republicans, remains resolved that Rom-

. ney can win. Like Pitman, Rankin said that

students were more likely to favor Rom-
ney’s economic policies. ’ V

“[Romney] has offered a plan to get the
economy growing again, and where he has
criticized the president, he has offered so-
lutions to differentiate himself,” Rankin
said in an email.

In contrast, Lara Sullivan, president
of the College Democrats, believes that
Obama’s proposals and record as president
still appeal to one of his major bases of
support, women. - 7

Sullivan pointed out that the Lilly Led-
better Fair Pay Act, named for a plaintiff
who won a workplace sexual discrimina-

.tion case heard before the Supreme Court,

was the ﬁrst bill that Obama signed when

 

he entered oﬂice. She also believes that
the middle class and students will beneﬁt
from his re—election, and that the election
results would reﬂect this.

“I think President Obama is all about a‘
level playing ﬁeld, and we have to have that
social safety net,” she said.

Rankin, for one‘, believes that Obama’s
lead among students has shrunk because
of Romney’s emphasis on creating jobs.

“[The College Republicans] have con-

tinued to make the case that jobs are the _

No. 1 issue for college students and that the
president’s policies have failed to deliver
jobs for four years,” he said via email.

As both campaigns prepare for the ﬁnal
lurch forward to the polls, Shuster said he
does not believe that the American/public
overwhelmingly favors either candidate.

“I don’t see either one of [the candi-
dates] walking away from this easily,”
Shuster said. “It’s going to be a long night.”

Standardized exams notgood
indicators of success T  “

Eric Baldwin
’ Columnisi

It’s Halloween, and I thought it
would be appropriate to discuss
a menacing spectre: standardized
exams. As the deadline for graduate
school applications grows closer,
those of us hoping to attend are
furiously putting together appli-
cations and studying for the MCAT,
LSAT, GRE or one,.0f the other dis-
cipline-speciﬁc exams and hoping
that our scores are high enough to
get us into the programs we’re hop-
ing to enter. . jl ’ ’
Many of us thought that we had
left standardized ‘exams behind us
when we ﬁnished taking the SAT.
But four years later, It’s again time
to have our intellectual worth mea-
sured by an arbitrary and illogical
metric. I call it arbitrary and illogi-

  

cal because after studying, taking.

practice exams andrcceiving scores
that were more diflicult to compre-
hend than the actual exam, I now
question how the GRE,actually mea-
sures my academic-=worth. 

s The exam is divided into ver-
bal, quantitativeiand analytical
writing portions. The verbal and
quantitative reasoning portions

are measured by a ‘computerized

system that uses a process called
equating to assign different values
to questions of varying difficulty.
The written portion is_also digitally
scored, with software that the Edu-
cational Testing Service — the test
administrator —— claims evaluates
and assesses human writing accu-
rately. It is then also read by at hu-
man reader, whose qualiﬁcations
are not released by the ETS. The
exam takes ﬁve hours to complete
from beginning to end. " T
Certain GPA and test—score
thresholds are expected by most
graduatéprogram admission com-
mittees before they will even con-
sider thé other factors in a candi-
date’s application. Some programs,
especially doctoral and master’s
programs, are more holistic in their

1 admissions approaches and consid-

er a variety of factors besides -GPA
andtest scores, while medical and

law school admissions_ are far more

contingent on GPA and test scores.
While I am in favor; of the ._more
holistic approach to admissions,
I understand the rationale behind
using standardized exam scores
as an objective measure. With the

narrow down the applicant pool is
by using objective standards, such
as a standardized exam. It is often
argued that GPA could be used in its
place. The GPA is useﬁil to assess an
applicant to a certain degree, but,
when comparing applicants from
different universities, it becomes a
subjective measure, given that dif-
ferent universities have different
. standards.  ~
The only logical soluti "ii is to

i use an objective measure suchas

a standardized exam. The issue
then becomes the affordability of
the exam and what it tells an admis-
sions committee about a student.
An exam that tests abilities such
as text interpretation and analy§-

' sis, ﬁllingin sentence blanks with

vocabulary words and performing
high ‘school-level arithmetic 
seem to neglect any assessment
of students’ abilities to work in 'a
speciﬁc discipline or their ability to

In what is supposed tobe a meritocratic aca-

uate—program exams test a student’s ability
to spend $175 on the exam itself and possibly
more on tutors, books and special software to
prepare for the exams. Often, undergraduate
studentswanting to go to graduate school
are pressed for cash and have little support

~ from their families. This ﬁnancial barrier to
participation is blatantly contradictory to
meritocratic goals.

What is apparent is that these exams for
entrance to graduate programs do not reﬂect
the breadth .of focus, the depth of analysis
and the emphasis on critical reasoning that
is common in ambitious undergraduates and
required for graduate students. The stan-
dardized exams industry has very little to
do with actual learning and more to do with
testing students on antiquated and inaccu-’
rate measures of one’s ability for;the sake of

maintaining and increasing proﬁts. I

Nationals’ decision

Tyler Pecyna A
Stqff Writer

Teams around baseball could learn a few things i

from the San Francisco Giants, who have be-
come a model franchise over the past few sea-
sons. Their four—game sweep of Detroit in the
World Series marked San Francisco’s second
title in three years.

The championship capped an improbable
run of postseason playforthe Giants, but atthis
point, their success is unsurprising—— especially
when the Washington Nationals, who entered
the playoffs as the top seed and a favorite to
represent the National League in the World
Series, decided to shut down ace staitingpitcher
Stephen Strasburg for the season. -

Mike Rizzo, Washington’s general manager, i

made the decision to protect Strasburg -— who
is two years removed from Tommyjohn surgery
onhis right elbow-— by removinghimfrom the
pitching rotation until the 2013 season after
Strasburg pitched on Sept. 7. Though Rizzo
followed recommendations from doctors, sur-
geons and elbow specialists, his decision is still
under review outside of the organization...

"I was supportive of their decision and am
comfortable that my medical advice was re-
sponsibly considered,” Dr. Lewis Yocum, the
surgeon who operated on Strasburg, told the
Los Angeles Times. '

Yocum noted that the decision was ulti-
mately up to management. ’

Teams all around baseball covet their pros-
pects and young players “more now than they
ever have, so Washington’s decision to bench
the 24-year-old right-hander makes sense for
the long-term.

In 2011, San Francisco faced a similar situa- -

tion with its then-24-year- old superstar catcher,
Buster Posey. Posey, like Strasburg, was an early

ﬁrst-round pick. In Posey’s‘ second year in the
majors, Marlins outﬁelder Scott Cousins bar-
reled him overinaplay at home plate. The 2010
National League Rookie of the Year fractured
his ﬁbula and tore ligaments in his ankle on
the play, an injury just as severe for catchers
as tearing an ulnar collateral ligament —.as
Strasburg did —— is for pitchers?

“Watch a catcher’s ankles during a game,”
one National League athletic trainer told Sports
Illustrated’s Will Carroll. “They’re always in-
Volved.”

Before Posey’s injury, the Giants were six

to sit Strasburg for playoffs lmi

 

galnes over.500 andhadthebestrecordinthe ~  V

NL West division. Without him, San Francisco

I was four games over .500 but lost the division

lead to Arizona. .

The Giants could’ve rushed their starting
catcher back into action in order to make a
last-ditch effort at the division title or wild card,
but they took the conservative approach and
let Posey rehab from surgery until the start of
their 2012 campaign. —

Shortly after Posey’s injury was diagnosed,
there was speculation from doctors and experts
who said Posey would have to abandon catching.
Onjune 1, 2011, Carroll, who focuses on sports
medicine, wrote online in a colunm, “It’s not
news that Poseyis done forthe season. Itis news
that he might be done as a catcher  [because]
the procedure done makes it difficult for many
to think he’ll be able to [catch] effectively.”

Rather than end Posey’s career behind the
plate, the Giants decided to give him sporadic
breaks from crouching behind home. They
didn’t just bench him or tell him his season
would be cut short to prevent excess stress on
his ankles, but instead they kept his valuable
bat in the lineup by playing him at ﬁrst base.
During the regular season, Posey played 29
games at ﬁrst base and 114 as a catcher. His

 

Washington Nationals pitcher Steven Strasburg could have helped his

of their playoff rotation. MCT Campus
.336 batting average was-the best in baseball,

and he’s likely to be given the league’s Most

Valuable Player Award.
The Nationals could have opted to put Stras-

burg, who was compiling Cy Young-caliber
stats, in the bullpen — especially given the ‘

team’s drop-off in performance since his last
start on Sept. 7.

The Nationals were eventually eliminated
from the postseason in the Division Series
against St. Louis, which culminated in a Game
5 comeback by the Cardinals, who trailed by
two runs entering the.top of the ninth. With

_ two outs, St. Louis scored four runs and. held

Washington scoreless inthe bottom half of the
inning to take the series. In the Championship
Series, the Cardinals were bounced by the even-
tual champs. _ r
If Washington had advanced instead of
St. Louis, this year’s records indicate that San
Francisco would have had a tough time dealing
with the Nationals. Washingtonwon ﬁve out of

 

six matchups with the Giants in 2012, scoring
almost eight runs per contest.

But what ifwashington kept Strasburg active
for the playoffs and pitched him every ﬁve days
out of the bullpen, similar to San Francisco’s
move to play Posey at ﬁrst? That way, Stras-
burg would have kept his rotation rhythm but
wouldn’t have thrown nearly as many pitches
in an outing. Washington could’ve used him in
the ninth inning against St. Louis instead of

watchinga season’s work evaporate in a matter .,;;

of minutes.

In fact, San Francisco adopted this idea for
its playoff run. Tim Lincecum won back-to-back
Cy Young awards in 2008 and 2010, but his
velocity has been steadily decreasing in every
year at the Major League level, resulting in a
terrible 2012 season. That trend typically hints
toward some sort of injury or discomfort, but
no serious injurywas diagnosed, and San Fran-

The season started out extremely well for
the Pitt men’s soccer team.

It was undefeated going into the Big East
opener Versus Cincinnati on Sept. 22, and a
berth in the 10-team Big East Tournament
was certainly not out of the question.

But once conference play started, the
team fell apart, failing to beat or tie a single
opponent in its last nine games. According
to Pitt head coachjoe Luxbacher, the disap-

pointing development of what started as
a hopeful season was in large part due to
injuries and an extremely tough confer-
ence schedule.

, “We don’t like to make excuses for these
losses, but when you’re playing top-10

teams every game, those games become.

a lot easier if you’re at full strength. This
year, we’ve missed key guys at key points,”
he said. i '

Starting on Sept. 29 against then—No. 5
Georgetown, the Panthers (6—9—2, 0-8-0
Big East) faced four teams ranked in the
top 10 of the national rankings (including
a road contest with Notre Dame), all in a
three-week span. "

Despite the difficult schedule, the Pan-
thers did have a few notable chances to grab
their ﬁrst Big East win of the year. They let
each opportunity slip through their ﬁngers,

. most notably a game against Providence
‘ during which Pitt fell in overtime, 3-2.

One-goal losses seemed to be a theme
for the Panthers; they held a few of the elite
Big East teams to tight games. I ;

. The most diﬂicult of the losses came on
seniorpnight against the_then-No. 4 UConn

Huskies. Pitt led the contest 1-0 before UCo-
nn scored a goal from 35 yards out in the
58th minute. The goal swung momentum
in the Huskies’ favor, with UConn scoring a
game-winning shot shortly after and even-
tually defeating the Panthers 2-1.

And then there were games on the road
in which Pitt struggled against Seton Hall,
Notre Dame and Villanova. -

Those three opponents dominated the

Panthers, with a combined score of 15-2
against Pitt. '

The most recent of those contests,
against Villanova, ended in a 4-0 defeat of
the visiting Panthers.

Pitt was outshot 24-8 and had just one
attempt on goal. The.Wildcats scored in
the 22nd minute, and they added three late
goals to cruise to “victory. ~ _

However, there were a few bright spots

_v.

for the Panthers this season, as well. The
most memorable was the Sept. 14 game
against Northern Kentucky.

The Panthers fell behind by two goals?‘
-midway through the second half, after al-
. lowing the second goal in the 59th minute.

But freshman midﬁelder Nick Wysong com-
pleted a hat trick — on his birthday, no less
— in front of his family to lead his team to a
comeback victory. After the game, Wysong?’
described the night as “more than he could
have imagined,” and he was awarded Big
East Rookie of the Week for his performance
in that game and his performance against
rival Duquesne in the following match, in
which he collected an assist. ' .“.\.

Nico Wrobel won Big East Offensive Player of
the Week and Eastern College Athletic Con-
ference Player of the Week for scoring three
goals — twoof which were game winners.

These few positives aside, the season
as a whole proved to be a disappointment.
While some of the blame can be placed on
the team’s youth and lack of experience, Pitt
consistently underachieved, mostly because
of poor play from its back line. 4 ,

. Thought to be a strength of the team
coming into the season, the Pitt defense
was extremely inconsistent all season long.
Although the backline achieved a consider-
able amount of success in matches such
as those against UConn and Duquesne,

—. ,_ j . tr
Freshman Graham Smith (

left) ntlfthe Panthes oten looked overwhelmed in the’

extremely bad games against Navy, Notre
Dame and Marquette were peppered with
turnovers leading to sloppy goals and mis-
marked players. .

But the youth that deﬁned this squad
won’t do so next year, according to freshman
goalie Dan Lynd, who started the ﬁnal two
games of the season, against UConn and
Villanova, and saw a total of 229 minutes
this season.

“I don’t consider guys like [defender]

] Kevin [Fielden] and Nick [Wysong] fresh-

men anymore. They’ve all gotten experi-
ence, and that can’t hurt us,” Lynd said.

So as Pitt looks back on the season before
looking ahead to its move to the ACC next
year, one thing should stand out for the
Panthers: This team needs to improve if it
is to compete at a high level during confer-
ence play next season. I

cisco stuck with its formerqace by sticking him
in the bullpen.

In his 13 postseason innings out of me ’pen,
Lincecum surrendered just one run. His success
was critical and certainly boosted the Giants to
a World Series title. -

Strasburg could have ﬁlled the same relief
role as Lincecum, but Washington’s ultra—con—
servative approach prevented him from seeing
any playoff action.

Tanner Wilt, a sophomore pitcher on Pitt’s '

baseball team, suffered a shoulder strainin high
school and sees the. logic from the player’s and
the managements perspectives in favoring the
long—term mindset over the short—term.

“As a fan, it was deﬁnitely disappointing to
see [Strasburg’s season end]. But as aplayer, it’s
easy to understand,” Wilt said. “Them having so
much money invested in him, and him coming

 

off a major surgery, it’s hard to argue.”

Wilt described the pain ofhis shoulder injury
as “shatrp,” and noted that such a feeling can
affect at pitcher’s mindset. — . .

“Even though [the rehabilitation process]
was onlyta few weeks off, it was deﬁnitely a dif-
ferent feel,-” he said. “I can only imagine what
it wouldbe like coming off of a major surgery.
You have to try and block it out of your mind,
but that’s the hardest part.”

But this season came without any reports of

' pain for Strasburg, and his success leaves little

doubt about mental distress, naturally leading
Nationals fans to question Rizzo’s decision.
l Washington is young and should have a

healthy Strasburg for all of next year, meaning ,

this team can be expected to compete in 2013.

Butwith the success San Francisco continues
to achieve with franchise-player Posey, it will
be difﬁcult for any National League team to
compete against the Giants.

The goal of professional sports organiza-
tions is to win championships, and Washin'gton’s
regular season was an indication that it was
ready do so. There’s no guarantee the Nationals
will be as successﬁll in 2013, so assuming that
Strasburgwill regain his 2012 form thenis risky.
But shutting down their ace outright, the team
greatly diminished its World Series aspirations
and helped the Posey-led Giants win another.
championship trophy. i
