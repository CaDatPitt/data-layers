‘Congressonial Election Race On

Center OK  
Hinges on
Supervision

The true status‘ of student faci-
lities offered the Student Christian
Federation by the Grace Reformed
Church was explained yesterday by
Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men.
Earlier he met with Helen P. Rush,
dean of women, and Dick Camp-
bell, chairman of the Student Chris-
tian Federation. ~

"We (representing the University)
are willing to approve the facilities
of the Grace Reformed Church as
headquarters for the Student Chris-
tian Federation,”said Dean Biddle.

SCF Supplies Supervisors

However, the church facilities
should not be thought of as a Uni-
versity student center, since a
sttident center entails supervision
by the University and some mea-
sure of administration by the whole
student body, he said.

The church facilities are not to
supervised by the University, but
by the Student Christian Federation
a single organization within the
the student body.

A May Open April 3
University approval still hinges
on an acceptable staff of super-
visors for the center, all of whom
the Federation must supply. Ac-
cording to Dean Biddle, a schedule
of stipervision already supplied by
the SCF has been approved, but the
Federation has yet to produce the
persons who will do the super-
vising.
iAt- present, added Dean Biddle,
the Federation is pointing for an
opening April 3, with the reserva-
tion, of course, and the supervisory
staff is acceptable to the University.

At Talkathon

It's not every professor who can

but Dr. David B. Rogers of the
sociology department has proved,
his speaking ability.

He gave the same talk three times
in three hours to three groups of
high school students of Herron Hill
Junior High.

Upon arriving at the school audi-
torium, Dr. Rogers found that it
seated only, 500 students at one
time. Since the school has about
1500 enrolled, he gave his talk on
-‘crime prevention three ‘times in
order to reach them all.

The talk was part of a series be-

at the annual Parents Forum which
was held on Tuesday at Stephen

Miss Rush urged the parents to
think together with their daughters
on the various situations that arise
during‘ their senior year. A

"This transition from college to
a position in the field they have
chosen,” declared the deaf! Of
women, "is an adjustment period.
During this time, the student is de-
pendent upon her parent’s encour-

Many problems that confront senior
girls and their parents were brought
out by Dean Rush. She mentioned
the increase of social affairs during
the senior year, the increase of fi-
nancial worries, and last but not
least, the ever iﬁreasing number
of engagement rings.

That some parents consider en-

 PITT NEWS - Tuesday, March 24, 1950 — Page 2

ePhiarmacy’s Place

Apparently, if you take the recent News story which lightly!

C treated the somewhat outdated facilities at the School of Phar-

macy, counterbalance it with a letter to the News from Pharmacy
Student Denny Shaffer which emphasized the seriousness of cer-
tain conditions at the school, then split the two down the middle,

’ you would have an accurate picture of Pitt's least-known branch.

At least that’s the way Dr. Stephen Wilson, assistant dean of

j the school, looks at it. He points out that, far from being over-

looked, the school, which is actually not located much farther
from the Cathedral than Ellsworth Center, has a place in the am-
bitious expansion plans of the University.

Shaffer’s primary reason for writing the letter was to bring out
that, in all the material that has been published on the building
program, "never once have "I seen mention of (the Pharmacy school)
. . ._Perhaps the reason for this is that(people) are misinformed.”

**>|I ***

No, we don’t think this is particularly true. Nor has there
been~a complete absence of mention of the school in stories on
the expansion. It has simply been obscured by the bigger, more
expensive, though not necessarily more important, aspects of the

‘program. When they’re talking about million-dollar science halls,
medical centers, field houses, libraries, the Pharmacy school
tends to get lost in the shuffle. But it has not been forgotten.

_ ~*Current plans call for the pharmacists to move into the pre-
sent Medical School building (Pennsylvania Hall)when the medics
have their new School of Medicine building. This, in itself, is a
reason why little mention has come out with the University ex-

pansion stories. The Pharmacy School is, according to present‘

plans, only to occupy an existing structure, not getting a new

lone. Hence, the publicity, which was involved in fund raising,

barely touched Pharmacy.

I Dr. Wilson points out, too, that the plans, as have many of the
other building plans, may still be changed. For all he knows, the
school might yet end up in a new building. It’s still indefinite as

I to when the Pharmacy may vacate its long-time residence on the

Boulevard of the Allies and join the rest of the school on the

i campus proper.

* * * * * *
Needless to say, Mr. Shaffer’s complaints -- doubtless com-
plaints shared by many others on the Boulevard -- will be realized
and remedied as well as possible when the shift is made. And,

T» I’m sure the welcome mat will be out, as it was when the school

became a direct branch of the University a few years ago, when
the Pharmacy students arrive in Oakland to take a greater part

I in the University life.

Our Error

An omitted word "say" tended to twist a paragraph in Tues-
day's editorial and we apologize for careless proofreading and any
harm that might have resulted. A

We were discussing the consideration that Judge Blair F.
Gunther might have had political aspirations irfmind in attacking

.Ptofessor Marion Hathway. The erroneous sentence should have

read, “While he doubtless has his own convictions on the matter,
Judge Gunther can reasonably be suspected, as (say) Robert X.

’Graham and other faculty members, of using this as a furtherance
I of his political ambitions.”

iUnder Their Noses

Unanimous agreement was reached by the panel at the Omi-

- cron Delta Kappa activities forum Tuesday that activities could

stand a greater degree of participation by the student body. But,

unfortunately, the attendance at the forum itself pointed out a

flaw that must be rectified if greater participation is to be se-
cured. There weren’t more than 50 persons interested enough in
a discussion of activities to sit in on the forum.

_l_s Dink Necessary?

With lfen’s Council embarking on a stricter enforcement of the
dink edict, the time is ripe for another careful look at that feature
of the customs and traditions program.

The dink, in the words of Joe "!"olfe,, chairman of the customs
and traditions committee, is not--repeat,--not a legalized, straight-

think does it really seem likely
that the wearing of a dink will
make a spirited student out of
a lackadaisical one? And will not
an enthusiastic student attack his
college career with just as much
gusto even if he does not have a
dink? A street-car student plus a
dink st‘ill equals a street-car
student.

And can class unity be achieved
or even approached by the mere
wearing of a dink or any other ex-
ternal symbol? Class unity must
rest on class pride, and pride must
be developed by a positive dis-
play of the really good things that
are present at a school like Pitt.

Dink No Influence

Surely it takes a far deeper in-
fluence than a silly, little cap to‘
make a man proud of his school, if
he does not enter with a feeling of
pride in the first place.

But okay, Council wants dinks.
Lastlsemester they were worn for
about a week and after that on a
virtually voluntary basis. And'the
dinks certainly did no harm if they
did no good.

But this semester, Council de ci-

By JACK }»1Am<ow1Tz

ded that the dink edict must be
enforced. Council put into action a
squad of upperclassmen who are to
forcibly see to it that the dinks are
worn. ‘A plan is also being deve-
loped to rope off a special section
of Pitt stadium seats in which the
freshman will have to sit so that a
check can be made on their dinks.

Not Worth Trouble

Surely Council is going too far.
The dink just is not worth the
trouble. The dink program does not
accomplish anything useful, so why
bother with enforcing it, espe-
cially when enforcement “entails the
great amount of time‘; confusion,
and trouble which it will.

Unfortunately, the dink program
has received such universal appro-
val among the members of Comcil,
that when enforcement of it falls

down, the first thing Council does .

is tighten the rules rather than
just sit down and consider again
whether the dink is really worth it.

The ‘result is that Men's Council
appears ridiculous by the use of
what some psople call "gestapo”
methods, and the useful parts of
the orientation program fall into
disrepute along with the freshman
cap .

Therefore Council should simply
forget the dink. Write it off as a
well-meaning experiment, and
concentrate on those aspects of
the orientation program which can
do some good.

Red Controversies

Nothing New for
Many U.S. Colleges

By JACK MARKOWITZ

Pitt is by no means the first

school to be concerned with the

problem of alleged communistic activity on its campus.
The question of how far academic freedom can go and when,

if ever, the safety of the nation

must abridge that freedom has

long concerned the American colleges.

The first major investigation of
college Communism in this decade
occurred in several New York col-
leges in the early part of 1941. The
entrance of the U. S. into the war
on the same side as Russia, of
course, brought to a close such
rather undiplomatic activity.

With the end of the shooting war
and the beginning of the cold war,
new emphasis was placed on Ame-
rican security, and many, feared

that the presence of Communist
teachers in universities consti-
tuted a very real threat to that
security.

At the end of 1948, little Olivet
College in Michigan became the
seat of intense controversy, when
a political science professor and
his librar_ian wife were dismissed
for holding “ultra-liberal views.”

Look to Washington

At about the same time the eyes
of American educators were turned
to Seattle, Washington, where an
extensive investigation of Commu-
nism among instructors at the Uni-
versity of Washington ' was in
progress. '

The outcome of the investigation
was the dismissal of three profes-
sors, two of whom were avowed
-members of the Communist party
and the third a teacher who refused

to say whether or not he was a
Communist, In addition, by the
advice of university president,

Raymond Allen, three other profes-
sors who admitted one-time party
membership but had resigned from
the party, were placed on probation.
Commagor Reports

Henry Steele Commager, repor-
ting on the investigation in "The
New Republic,” wrote that the
majority of the investigating com-
mittee did not believe that merely
belonging to the Communist Party
constituted a‘ just r’eason for dis-
missal”,_

President Allen, however, who
was not held by the decision of the
of the faculty committee, declared
that covert membership in the Com-
munist Party was indicative of a
general lack of good faith and re-
commended the additional dismis-
sal of the two avowed Co unists.

A more recent judgment on Com-
munism among teachers was handed
down in June, 1949 by a 16-man
commission of the National Edu-
cation Association which formally
proposed that Communist teachers
be banned from holding teaching
jobs.

Shortly after the Washington de-
cision, the committee on academic
freedom of the American Ass ocia—
tion of University Professors began
an investigation into the dismissal
of the three professors. This com-
mittee will probably report on its
findings at the convention of the
AAUP.

The rally, planned by the WSGA‘
Education-for-Election Committee,
is the first of its kind, designed
to stimulate interest in women’s
elections.

Gerry Pendro, chairman of the
committee, stressed that class

seven minutes. The skits, plus a
campaign song, will be judged by
faculty" advisors and a winner
chosen. The class presenting the:
most original skit and song will
be given a prize consistent with
the theme of the rally.

The skits should follow the ge-

Devey, Set

To Deliver
At Second

By JOHN MEGELLA

Old Opponents on Pitt’s 1950
baseball schedule may be in for a
surprise this year. Instead of being
tormented throughout the game by
Roger McGill’s rasping tirades as

in the past, Panther foes may get

a sermon.

I Raucous Roger, last year's heck-
ling second baseman, has been
graduated. Among the candidates
for McGill’s vacated post is Dave
Devey.

Devey, a junior in the School of
Education, spent a year preparing
for the ministry at West Virginia
Wesleyan. After his freshman year,
he transferred to Pitt.

‘Refined Pepperpot’

The stocky 160-pounder has made
a hit with Coach Ralph Mitterling
in early drills. A fleet, ‘heady run-
ner, the 20-year-old keystone sack-
er fits in with Mitter1ing’s plans
to field a smart-running team.

On and off the diamond Devey is
serious and soft-spoken. But this
doesn't mean that he’isn’t a hustler
on the playing field. One teammate
called him “a refined pepperpot —
the kind of a guy that gets you by
being nice.”

Snappy Fielder

A resident of Munhall, the five
and a half foot mittman was cap-
tain of the 1947 high school team
which won the Section 15, WPIAL
title. He played ‘shortstop then.

Facts onField House Picture
To Be Revealed in Pitt News

Pitt’s need for a field house has
been on the fire for some time now,
but no astounding progress has been
made in the realization of an ade-
quate sports arena for the Univer-
sity.

How soon will Pitt have a field
house? How is it going to compare
with field houses of other schools?
For what will it be used? Is Pitt
behind the times in field houses?
How will Pitt benefit from a field
house, andwill there be drawbacks?

These and many other questions
are being asked daily, as construc-
tion of the field house is scheduled
to begin.

Presentation of Facts

The Pitt News will answer these
questions beginning in next Tues-
clay’s edition. A series of articles
by Dave Pollock, veteran writer
of the sports staff, will show the
facts.

Pollock has made a study of 44

colleges and universities of Pitt's
size in every part of the country".
He has gathered pertinent informa-
tion
other schools and will present the
facts to Pitt News readers, com-
paring the local situation to cond-
tions in other sections of the na-
tion.

The need for a sports arena with
an adequate seating capacity in
Western Pennsylvania is apparent.
It was more recently emphasized
during the high school playoffs at
the Pitt Stadium pavilion.

Thousands Turned Away

Thousands of fans were turned
away because the seating capacity
of the Stadium (2800) was insuffi-
cient to take care of the crowd.

Dr. H.C. Carlson, Pitt basketball
coach and a strong advocate for a
sports arena here, points out that

If Bill Ford will be good enough to lie down on the couch,
Dr. Sigmund Kopelman will give him a psychoanalytical report on
what he has td do to win the Pit: shortstop berth this year.

I once was on the same American Legion team as Ford and had

an excellent opportunity to observe
him in action, seeing as I spent
nine out of ten games warming the
bench. The big_ trouble with the guy
is that he plays too hard.

When Ford makes an error he feels
like punching Ford in the mouth. A

reason for burying himself in a hole
and staying there until Groundhog
Day. When Ford hits into a double
play I think he is too embarrassed
to show himself in church next day.

Last year it was the same story
with Bill, who, while he held the
regular shortstop job, still worried
the edge off his play, in the minds

IT IS DEGRADING that Pitt's
name should continue to be listed
in the college division of the Knights
of Columbus track meets when the
school should be running in the uni-
versity division. The college divi-
sion is where they seed the weaker
clubs.

Is lack of proper practice facilities
preventing the University from being
just that in the world of track?

If ,so, Pitt track fans will have a
right to expect Coach Carl Olson
to have his clubs where they be-
long when the new field house is

By STAN SKIRBOLL

Bob Brennen is going to play a
lot of football for Pitt next year.

Who says so? Len Casanova,
Herm Meister, Jack Roche, and Don
Fisher are the ones who say so.

On four different occasions, each
of the four, coaches was asked
about Brennen’s potentialities. And
each gave the same answer: "Right
now we're not sure i where he is
going to play-- but he'll play some-
where.”

At Center Now

At the’ present ‘time, the strategy
board has the 6‘l, 220-pound sopho-
more playing at the center position.
Brennen is familiar with the pivot
spot, having played it under the
single wing, and T while in high
school. Brennen’s position at cen-
ter is not a certain_ty, however.
Meister, the line coach, already
has four capable centers in George
Radosevich, John Dazio, Stuart
Kline, and Gabriel Gembarosky.

"If Brennen doesn’t stay at cen-
ter because of the depth at that

spot,” Meister said, "he'll be
shifted somewhere else in the
line.”

It is probable, also, that Bren-
nen will be used as a line backer,
Meister added. '

Brennen Noncommittal

The big, rugged gridder, who
won a starting berth at quarterback
last year is noncommittal about
being shifted around. “Just so I
play,” is his attitude.

Meanwhile, last year’s varsity

Course Slated
In Lifesaving

ment starting Tuesday at Trees

member of the faculty or stiident

body.

The Club finds itself with a
large membership but with little.
interest. Bob Silberstein, presid-
ing over the meeting, grated, “The
Club is in the worst shape since
the start of the organization.”

However, interest was high among
those who were present, and iris‘
expected that through the work of
the lettermen and with the help
of the Athletic Department, the
club can be restored to an effic-
iently functioning body.

Optimism was shown not only

by the members present‘, but
also by Captain Tom Hiamilton.
Captain Hamilton, speaking in-
formally, declared, "The import-

ance of varsity clubs throughout
other universities is high in regard
to school activities.”

He hoped "that the position of
our lettermen club will be the
same.” Hamilton said the Univer-
sity eventually will give the letter-
men a clubroom.

The membership appointed an
executive committee to revive the
lost interest.

In stepping up the activities
of the group a dinner will be held
within two weeks welcoming Head
Football Coach Len Casanova and
his assistants. Chairman for the

ammittee is mittman Sam Shapiro.’

field last week. The goo that
is called Trees ‘Field prevented
much of any workouts during the
mid-week. The time was not wasted
however, as valuable chalk-talks
replaced the outdoor drills.

The junior varsity squad, which
will now work as a separate squad,
has already scrimmaged. As soon
as the weather improves, Casanova
hopes to take the varsity squad to
the Stadium, and keep the junior

As yet, none of the quarterback

 Indoor Track ‘

Season Ends 

Pitt's trackmen attack their last
hurdle of the indoor track season at
Schoonmaker Hall tomorrow after-
noon in the Senior AMA-AAU meet.

The team encouraged by its show-
ing in the Knights of Columbus
games is confident of winning the
meet again this year. Last year the
varsity won the team championship
with a 27 point total.

The entire varisty squad will take
part in the events. A few of the
freshman thinclads are expected to
perform if called upon. The low and
high hurdles, the one and two mile
runs, and the 50-yard dash will fea-
ture the meet. ' '

Trees Pool

Now Ready

Trees pool has been pronounced
ready for use since the repairing of
cracks in the pool bottom.

For an unspecified period of time,
however, a coating of tar-like mas-
tic material will be kept on the re-
paired places to prevent any pos-
sible leakage.

At present, only a negligible
amount of water, if any at all, is
leaking, according to Raymond L.
Coss,
and grounds.

The rejuvenated tank was first
used last Saturday for an inter-
scholastic swimming meet, and
since then swimming classes have
begun to use it.

The only change noticeable is a
slight tarry smell in the water, re-
sulting from the? coating on the
cracks. ‘
