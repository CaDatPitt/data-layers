Seventy wer cent of the pop-
ulation of the United States is
now living in 212 metropoli-
tan areas. Overcrowded urban
conditions have created vio-
lence, lawlessness and degen-
eration which are symptomatic
of a growing cultural, econom-
ic a n d political alienation.
P o v e r t y , unemployability, and
civil rights demand urgent solu-
tion. The nation must satisfy its
needs ior housing. health a nd
medical services through improv-
ed and new kinds of programs.

Urban universities must re-
spond in far more imaginative and
sustained ways to these traumat-
ic changes and needs of urban so-
ciety. The centers of learning
must provide relevant training, re-
search and technical assistance to
government.

Government gives little atten-
tion to urban affairs in contrast
to the attention it gives space ex-
ploration, weapons systems and
production a nd distribution of
food and raw materials. The ma-
jority of these systems were built
with the effective help of institu-
tions of higher learning. '

V‘ In some of its efforts. the Univ-
ersity has received what is equiv-
alent to a mandate from govern-
ment agencies seeking help. Many
programs. however. evolved and
developed because of the Univer-
sity’s commitment to public serv-
ice and to keeping its academic
offerings in step with a chang-
ing age. Thus. the University is
committed to urban affairs not
only to aid the government. but in
order to keep pace with a grow-
ing and changing urban popula-
tion.

Presently. it is difficult to look
into any department of the uni-

or without finding some faculty
member who is offering his con-
sulting services to enhance some
phase of urban living.

Indeed, urban phenomena are
not the exclusive concern of ur-
ban specialists. Ecological studies
by biologists are essential to
man’s control of his environment.
Geographers, economists and so-
ciologists are needed in a city
planning a g e n c y ; biologists,
chemists, statisticians and engi-
neers cooperate in the work of a
public health department.

The University, through liberal
and professional education of stu-
dents, may fulfill its commitment
to urban development. In the fu-
ture, urban problems will be solv-
ed through education of students
and government officials in urban
affairs. ‘

Poor People’s March
Rallies Student Support

Students in the Pittsburgh area
have begun to mobilize in sup-
port of the Poor People’s campaign

Leadership Conference.

The student-designed program
will concern itself with four areas.
according to Shelia Schumacher.
head of the University YWCA.
They are:

Supporting the Poor Peoples
Campaign by ‘distributing infor-
mation and communicating with
others in regard to the needs of
poor people.

A fund-raising campaign to
finance the Mid-West Bus Cara-
van of approximately 6.000 poor
people who will arrive in Pitts-
burgh Wednesday‘ and leave for
Washington Thursday.

A massive letter-writing cam-
paign to Congressmen in Wash-

ington urging them to respond to
the problems and requests of poor
people in Washington.

Recruitment of participants. es-
pecially students. to go to Wash-
ington on May 30 to participate
in a confrontation with the Na-
tional Government along with the
masses of poor people.

A booth will be set up on the
Ground Floor of the Cathedral
Tuesday Wednesday and Thurs-
day from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. In-
formation on all aspects of the
Campaign will be available and
special envelopes will be avail-
able for contributors. Stationary.
stamps. and addresses of Penn-
sylvania Congressmen will be

Choice ’68 Poll Reveals Student
Adversity To Vietnamese Conflict

by DIANE BLOCH

..Students today are as left wing
as the demonstrations seem to in-
dicate. They are as much against
the war as it appears. according
to the results of the Choice ‘68
national campus primary.

More than 62 per cent of the
students who voted in Choice 68
were against the Viet Nam war.
with 45 per cent calling for a
phased reduction of the American
military commitment and 17 per-
cent demanding immediate with-
drawal. Less than half that num-
ber —-30 per cent — favored an
increased or all out military ef-

fort. Only seven per cent support-.

ed the present policy.

 

 

Senator Eugene McCarthy led
in the vote for the presidential
candidate. with Senator Robert
Kenedy coming in second. With
a choice between two major
groups of candidates. the “liber-
als" and the “conservatives."
the students voted over-whelming-
ly. 61.6 per cent to 30.4 per cent.
for the “liberals.” The division
between the two types of candi-
dates is an arbitrary one. Candi-
dates are classified as “liberals"
on the basis of their desire for
some kind of end to the war and
swift. decisive action to deal with
the problerﬁs of racism and pov-
erty. The ‘‘conservatives’‘ are
those candidates with the basic

Vietnam and using force to put
down racial unrest.

The resulting view on the war
in Vietnam and the students’
choice ‘of candidates show that a
substantial majority of students-
almost two-thirds- oppose the
war and want action to bring
black people into full participa-
tion in the society.

The majority of students. how-
ever, are not activists. The results
of the student vote show that the
causes of the activities, rather
than their tactics, have the sup-
port of themajority of the stu-
dents. ‘ A

It appears that the views of

. eminent election had. ..

mary. most University students
still favor Senator Eugene Mc-
Carthy. Kennedy claimed 33 per
cent and New York Governor Nel-
son Rockefeller followed with 22
per cent.

One student liked McCarthy be-

cause “He is somebody who stood
up for his principles.” Marcia

Manovich. a sophomore. likes Mc-f

Carthy’s and Kennedy's ideas, but
scorns Kennedy for “jumping on
the political bandwagon.” Eileen
Pollock. a junior, also liked Ken-
nedy's ideas. but calling him
“power “hungry,” have her sup-
port to McCarthy. McCarthy sup-
porters also like Rockefeller’s ex-
perience. and offer Rockefeller or
Kennedy as their second choice.

Kennedy supporters strongly
supported their candidate. Judy
Hayduk. a senior. believes that
Kennedy is the most realistic
choice. She said, “The Indiana
primary gave Kennedy’s cam-
paign a big‘boost." Judy Frank
echoed Susan Ross‘ opinion that
Kennedy “will end the war in
Vietnam.” Miss Hayduk’s second
choice was McCarthy. since she
does not like any of the Republi-
cans and because “Humphrey
should be forgotten." Miss Ross,
however. liked Rockefeller be-
cause of this experience.

Ingrid Friedemann, a graduate
student, strongly supports Rocke-
feller because “he has more ex-
perience than Kennedy or Me-
Carthy.” As an alternate, she
would choose “any Democrat over
Nixon.” A junior disliked Nixon
because “If you’re going to vote
for Nixon, you may as well vote

nor Ronald Reagan of California.
Those interviewed favored -4; h e
the more liberal candidates and
felt that it is time for a change.
Humphrey, Nixon, or Reagan. ac-
cording to the survey, would con-
tinue the policies practiced by
President Johnson.

From the results of The Pitt
News survey, Senator McCarthy
may be regarded as the choice of
those who were polled. Kennedy

followed as a Presidential choice, .

but since McCarthy and "Kennedy
supporters both favor Rockefeller
as an alternative. he must be con-
sidered an attractive candidate.
A n d three leading candidates,
Nixon, Reagan, and Humphrey,
must make consiperable gains, ac-
cording to those polled,

To Language Requirement

A recent survey taken by the
Liberal Arts Cabinet has shown
that a majority of students are dis-
satisfied with the present language
requirement and grading system
of language courses at the Univer-
sity. Of the 1399 students who
were interviewed. 973 said that
they would not have taken a for-

to be very important. The inter-
est of the" press is an indication
of the lack of interest in student

opinions. Examples are “the morn-

ing after” coverage which was
page 27 in the New York Times.
No mention was made in the
Washington Post.

The long-run coverage will al-
so be minimal. More people voted
in Choice ‘68 than did in the New
Hampshire or Massachusetts pri-
maries. The student vote should
be significant enough to be
brought to national attention.

The indifference of the public
makes the students feel the use-
lessness of their situation. If the
students took the time to voice
their opinion in Choice ‘68, the
public might at least take notice
of them. At the University, ap-
proximately half the full time
students took time out to register
their vote. This was almost twice
the turnout that the Student Gov-

eign language if it had not been
required.

The survey also tested the re-
sponse of the students to systems
of grading other than the present
A, B, C, D, F grading system. Of
the 1393 students interviewed,
only 138 favored the present grad-
ing system. Five hundred students
favored a Pass and Unsatisfactory
Pass System. A Pass grade would

allow the student to advance to _ -

the next regular course in the se-

quence, whereas an Unsatisfac--

tory Pass would require the stu-

dent to take an intermediate course.
in the language before going on to

the next regular course. For ex-

ample, a student receiving an Un-

satisfactory Pass would be requir-

ed to take French 10 after French

I instead of French II.

Over half of the students, 746,
favored an Honors Pass, Pass, Or
Fail system. An Honors Pass
would be equivalent to an A or
B, while Pass would be equiva-

lent to a C or a D. Either an Hon- V

‘ors Pass or a Pass would entitle

the student to advance to the next 2 ’ A

course in the sequence.

In the final results, over 90 per-
cent of the students interviewed
favored a change in the grading
policy from the present, letter
grade system. to some type of Pass.

YMCA needs many students to help B1115 1,311 103115 to pmtestors
with projects during spring, summer

The YMCA needs an unlim-
ited number of University stu-
dents to help others through
friendship, recreation, and ed-
ucation. The ideas and involve-
ment are needed of those who
would work as volunteers in the
spring and summer programs.

A number of the activities cen-
ter around work with institution-
alized children and those who
come form environments termed
disadvantaged. Such children us-
usally have little motivation for
learning.

Project Motivation involves tu-
toring children of various age
groups throughout the city. Its
basic goals are to establish per-
sonal relationships of trust and
friendship to help children learn.

The participants in Reach (an-
other project) work with small
groups of elementary school girls

«from low income neighborhoods

in recreation, arts, and crafts.

Through Step (Subteen Enrich-
ment Program) volunteers will
work this summer with 8-14 year
old girls, teaching them skills
such as cooking, sewing, creative
arts, swimming, dancing. and
dramatics.

. The Y s Service to Handicap-
ped Children is a recreation pro-
gram sunday afternoons at the
Home for Crippled Children.

These children have a variety of
handicaps and supervision for
weekend fun-time must be pro-
vided. Students are also needed
to feed patients at Children’s
Hospital

Through Project Encounter vol-
unteers learn about recreational
therapy by working with retarded
and emotionally disturbed chil-
dren and adults.

The YWCA urges those con-
cerned with the crisis in race re-
lations to join with them in sup-
porting the Poor People’s Cam-
paign. Participants will aid in re-
cruiting others. raising money. or
participating in either the Sum-
mer Task Force or a Work-Study
Seminar in the nations capital.
Through another program. volun-

teers help realize fair housing
practices by locating apartments
in Pittsburgh for those having dif-
ficulty finding housing becasue
of discrimination.

Those in Focus on Action are
participating in interracial dialo-
gue by developing a program
aimed at door to door conversa-
tions with people in the suburbs
about race relations. civil distur-
bance. their reactions and respon-
sibilities. and by supporting pro-
posals for University action on re-
cruiting. admission. and compen-
satory programs.

The play is a series of vignettes

Language Policy?

An overwhelming majority of students at the University
desire some sort of change in the academic policy concern-
ing the language courses. Most of those interviewed specifi-
cally favored a change in the grading policy, through the
alteration of the present letter system to some type of pass-
fail system. The survey was conducted by student govern-
ment’s Liberal Arts Cabinet.

Some 973 students out of the 1399 who were interviewed
said that they would not have taken a foreign language If

it had not been required.

These results must be considered a serious indictment of
the status-quo concerning the language policy at the Univer-
sity. It is with this in mind that we must recommend a
change.

Approximately half of the students polled favored the
Honors Pass, Pass, or Fall system for the languages. The Hon-
ors Pass would be equivalent to an A or B. while pass would
be equivalent to a C or D. In this system, a student achiev-
ing either an Honors Pass or a Pass would be entitled to
advance to the next course in the sequence of the language.

We feel that this alternative is a good one. It will not only
take some‘ of the pressures off “grade making” but will, in
our view, make the learning of a language more of a pleasure
than a burden.

The action of the Liberal Arts Cabinet is worthy of~note

for it is attempting to find out what students want in terms
of academic policy. And we urge its members to conduct

more polls on matters of academic concern.

But we must alwo urge the Administration to give a con-
cerned look to the poll’s results for they reveal a student
opinion calling for a change. We also urge Dean Kehl, to
implement the Honors Pass, Pass Fail systems for languages.

Indiana Significance

In a April 3 editorial The Pitt News mentioned that “Sen-
ator McCarthy will never rasp away the democratic presi-
dential nomination from Senator Kennedy or anyone else.”
We supported our conclusion by citing the overall super-
iority of Senator Kennedy’s political organization as com-

‘pared with the relatively inexperienced cadre of Senator

McCarthy.

. This editorial conclusion, of course, was printed before the
Indiana primary-the first clash between Kennedy and Mc-
Carthy. Today, we feel that Senator Kennedy is in much bet-
ter position. He clashed with McCarthy in Indiana and has
won.

On the other hand, Senator McCarthy has suffered his first
primary defeat even though many of supporters maintain that
his 28 per cent of the vote should be considered a victory. But
Senator McCarthy’s defeat brings with it many serious con-
sequences.

The campaign of the Minnesota Senator. heretofore. has
been against nominal opposition. Thus, Indiana was COIlSld-
ered by most observers as a test case. After garnering 28 per-
cent of the vote as opposed to 42 per cent total of Senator
Kennedy, can Senator McCarthy’s movement continue to
grow? ‘ ‘

Even before the results of the Indiana primary were known,
the McCarthy campaign was suffering from that terminal
disease known as financial insecurity.

Senator McCarthy is now faced with three more primaries:
Nebraska, Oregon, and California, and he still has his finan-

’ cial problems; he still has the problem of organizational

strength; and now he has the added burden of a defeat

I knotched under his belt.

We respect the great courage of Senator McCarthy. But
We feel that his candidacy will not last much longer for he

has lost and will, most likely continue to lose.

Indiana Primary

McCarthy’s Primary Victory

by IVAN ABRAMS
Contributing Editor

Last weekend. along with about
150 other Western Pennsylvania
college students.I went to Indiana
to canvass for Senator Eugene
McCarthy. For many of us. it was
the second trip to the city of
Richmond and we were not look-
ing forward to canvassing. The
last weekend had been a disap-
pointment in that Senator McCar-
thy seemed to derive his support
only from the teaching staff and

students of Earlham college.

As it turned out. we were in for
a pleasant surprise. In my own
experience. which was. I am told.
rather typical. I found that many
people who openly said they had
voted Republican for years plan-
ned to cross party lines and vote
for McCarthy. Others who had
once supported the war in Viet-
nam planned to vote for McCar-
thy because they didn’t feel that
any other candidate could end
that war without more American
lives being lost. And. of course.
many people who have been op-
posed to the war for years now

admitted that the_y were no longer
afraid to show themselves because
of Senator McCarthy‘s campaign.

Thus. as Senator McCarthy him-
self seems to feel. getting 28 per-
cent of the Indiana vote is not a
sign of defeat but of victory. In-
diana is a conservative state and
to make inroads into that conser-
vatism with honesty. as Senator
McCarthy has done. is a major
accomplishment.

But what about Senator Ken-
nedy? Isn't he a liberal? The ans-
wer must be that in Indiana. Sen-
ator Kennedy outdid LBJ himself
in the political game. In a speech
in Richmond. Senator Kennedy
speng an hour talking about the
need for law and order. while in
Gary. in a black ghetto. he
praised the efforts of the poverty
program and promised more mon-
ey. Kennedy tailored his every
word to his audidnces. and unfor-
tunately. some Indianans fell for
it.

Senator McCarthy’s next battle
with the Kennedy clan comes in
Nebraska. McCarthy is from a
Minnesota farm and has long been

a friend of the American farmer.
while Kennedy is saddled with
the image of a typical city slicker.
It is. of course. unwise to make
any sort of prediction about the
Nebraska primary. but I person-
ally would give Gene McCarthy
favorable odds. The Kennedy
brand of hypocrisy does not seem
to go over very well with people
who have been lied to by the gov-
ernment for the past 80 years

The biggest problem that Sena-
tor McCarthy must face. of course.
is the worship 0d the late John F.
Kennedy. Apparently. many Am-
ericans seem to feel that the reas-
cedance of a Kennedy to the Pres-
idency would erase all the prob-
lems that have arisen since JRK’s
death. But Eugene McCarthy has
the courage to face those problems
and tell people not necessarily
what they want to hear. but what
must be said. He did this in Pitts-
burgh and he did this in Indiana.
McCarthy’s honesty is his great-
est asset; it is an asset that few of
his detractors have cared to reckon
with.

and write you this letter. How-

dare you sir. say that you are
representing the most patriotic
people in America when you sup-

not hesitate to send pleas here for
donations from my son. who this
moment stands against the enemy
in Vietnam. He is a graduate of
the University. If he were home.
he. I am sure. would publicly
call you a liar. Any young man
of draft age who is fit for mili-
tary duty and does not feel love
enough for this country in a time
of war and while alumni brothers
are in grave peril of their lives.

It is a very sad affair when a

The Oakland business district probably
detracts more from the University cam-
pus than any other single factor. It is just
plain dirty.

On the other hand. the University ad-
ministration makes every attempt possible
to keep the Campus grounds looking clean
and trim. The Cathedral lawns and shrubs.
along with those of the Student Union and
neighboring facilities are always well
trimmed. This fact permits the University
to be ready. at any time. to extend a wel-
coming invitation to any University visit-
ors. Needless to say. the physical appear-
ance of the campus must also be kept per-
fect if only to impress visiting high school
students along with the many parents of
freshman who come to look over the Uni-
versity.

This is all well and good. In fact. no

one would argue that University grounds
and buildings should be allowed to de-
teriorate. The physical upkeep of proper-
ty is just good business sense.

Somehow, these facts seem to have es-
caped most Oakland business managers.
First of all, people prefer to shop, and will
even go out of their way, to shop in pleas-
ant surroundings. Shadyside is a fine ex-
ample of this. Of course, Shadyside has
its own character which should not be
imitated.

There is something more relevant about
the Oakland business district — its relation
to the University campus. Except for a few
stores. this business district has reached a
point where it acts as a major blot or flaw
sitting on the edge of the campus. An un-
suspecting person might literally be shock-
ed upon entering "downtown" Oakland.

Friday, May‘l0, 1968—THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

Downtown Oakland described as campus disgrace

Generally. the building are in sad need of
a face lifting to destroy a sagging. tried-
outlook.

The problem extends to the upper floors
of the buildings. Often. they are even in
worse shape. No one can deny that these
buildings are relics of an ancient era.
However. a coat of paint would do won-
ders to spruce them up. With the right col-
ors. these old buildings could be trans-
formed into classic examples of past forms
of American architecture.

There are other things that one finds
disturbing. For example, the parking lot
around the White Tower. In some corners,
the rubbish lies more than several inches
deep. If someone doesn’t watch out, Oak-
land may have another fire to its credit.

Down the way. there's a stupendous
park located next to Gus Millers. Although

 

it's small. it's chocked full of goodies;
bricks. broken and crumbled concrete. and
other assorted paraphanelia. Of course.
one might take a different view and say
that this “stuff" makes an excellent ground
cover——it never needs a mowing!

The next best place to look it at your’

feet. The cigarette, butts would make a
grand. holiday for any hobo. There‘s such
a variety of dirt packed into the corners
and curbstones that Oakland florist might
well consider starting their own local
greenhouses. Zinnias might be a good first
choice.

of what can be done in Oakland. It might

\ Gulf of Tonkin Controversy

by PAUL STOLLER, Editor

In the course of four days. De-
fense Secretary Robert S. McNa-
mara had fooled and cajoled so
many members of the US Senate
that the passage of the Tonkin
Gulf Resolution was a mere for-
mality. After. a four year span.
and a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee investigation. it is

- -easy to see that McNamara was
‘« painting a distorted picture of the

Gulf of Tonkin incidents.

Throughout his testimony. the
Defen se Secretary maintained
that the Maddox was on a “rou-
tine mission in international wa-
ters.” The orders cabled to the
Maddox. however. reveal another
conclusion. The Maddox was or-
dered to sample the electronic en-
vornment on the North Vietnam
‘coast. was this routine?

Even the crew members of the’
Maddox thought that its mission
was something less than “rou-
” Andrew Adamick stated:
“We were on a secret mission."

' -.Maddox radioman James Stanke-

vitz described the boarding of a
special communications t e a m
that was supposed to operate a

Vmysterious black box. Stankevitz

reported that the communications
team was isolated from the rest
of thefcrew.

Even Commodore Herrick, the

‘ commander of the Maddox, ad-
mitted that the make-up of the
_ communications team was classi-
fied. When asked about the al-
gleged connection between the
mission of the Maddox and the
National Security Agency (NSA
— a secret communications intelli-

gence Branch), Herrick replied:

.“I don’t know, I can’t commit

myself.”

David Wise and Senator Wayne
Morse maintain that the Maddox
was not on a secret mission at all.
Both men agree that the Mad-
doxwas on a "highly classified
ELINT (electronic spy mission
similar to the Pueblol mission to
gather intelligence from North
Vietnam's radar and electronic
defense. a process involving
ECM‘s (electronic counter meas-
ureslf‘

In light of this evidence. the
“routine patrol" description must
be deemed inaccurate. After all.
how could the Maddox be simply
on a routine mission when its
commander admitted that the
communications team on board
his ship was classified and when
part of the cabled orders of the
Maddox instructed the ship to
“sample the electronic environ-
ment” on the North Vietnamese
Coast? Finally. why didn‘t Sec-
retary McNamara point out these
details in 1964?

But the controversy concerning
the distorted classification “rou-
tine mission” is but a smathering
of the inaccuracies. There is a
great body of evidence suggest-
ing that the Maddox had violated
the territorial waters of North
Vietnam.

The late John McNaughton tes-
tified in 1966 that the Maddox
did. in fact. violate international
law by traveling withing the rec-
ognized 12 mile water limit; Mc-
Narmara claimed that McNaugh-
ton was wrong because the North

 

 

Vietnames had claimed a three
mile limit.

Three men. one of them a mem-
ber of the Defense Department
suggest that the Maddox violated
international law in the Gulf of
Tonkin. Moreover. not one Ad-
ministration official after four
years. has stated the motive of
the North Vietnamese attacks on
a ship that was on “routine pa-
trol in international waters."

From this information, it is
quite easy to draw a parallel with
the case of the Pueblo, another
US ship on a “routine patrol in
international waters.” What mo-
tivated the North Koreans to seize
that ship. The only conclusion
that can be drawn was that both
the Maddox and the Pueblo had
violated the territorial waters of
North Vietnam and North Korea,
respectively, for what motives
could these tiny nations have in
attacking a ship of the United
States —— the most powerful na-
tion in the world.

The Maddox was not at all on
a routine mission. Nor was its pa-
trol restricted to the confines of
international waters. Neverthe-
less. Mr. McNamara still main-
tains that the initial attack on the
Maddox was “unprovoked." This

SU sponsors trip to Fallingwater-

The University Student Union
will sponsor its Second Annual
Spring Excursion to Fallingwa-
ter. the famous house designed
by Frank Lloyd Wright. on Sun-
day. May 26. 5 A
‘Fallirigwater. one of Wright‘s
most widely acclaimed works.

_ wasiidesigned in 1936 for Pitts-

burgh department store owner
Edgar J. Kaufmann. The side of
the famous house was the Kauf-
mann family’s weekend and sum-
mer mountain retreat in the Bear
Run Valley of Fayette County.
Pa.

The key to the beautiful setting
of the Bear Run area is the wa-
terfall over which the house is
built. The Kaufmanns had indi-
cated the area around the falls as
the location for a home. and were
unprepared for the architect’s
suggestion that the house rise
over the waterfall rather than
looking at it. But Wright’s orig-
inal scheme was adopted almost
without change. and was com-
pleted in 1939.

The house is constructed with
sandstone quarried on the proper-
ty. The stone serves to separate
reinforced “trays,” forming lev-
e l s dramatically cantilevered
over the stream.

Tickets for the trip to Falling-
water are now on sale. at the SU
information desk. Priced at $3. a
ticket entitles the purchaser to
bus transportation, a picnic lunch
and the tour of Fallingwater. The
excursion is open to the Univer-
sity Community and guests.

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA

This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
ﬁnal exams looming obscenely close, you don't want jokes;
you want help.

So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all ﬂunking. I refer, of
course, to biology. ..

Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

 

Another popular class of animals is the periphera-a
shadowy category that borders often onrthe vegetable.
Take, for example, the sponge. The sponge is deﬁnitely an
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is deﬁnitely not.

Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people
ﬁnd insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—Tumblz'ng Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Gnats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT.

Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projec-
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.

I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per-
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly, scratchlessly and matchlessly. It is a distinct pleas-
ure to shave with Personna Blades and to write about
them but sometimes, I confess, I ﬁnd it difficult to work
the commercial into a column. Some years ago, for ex-
ample, I had the devil’s own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way I ﬁnally
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle at
Delphi, “Oracle, I have tasted all the world’s pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed.” To which the Oracle replied, “Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blades—but, alas for
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 years.”
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a ﬁt of weeping that
Zeus ﬁnally took pity and turned him into a hydrant . . .
Well sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy ofArts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure.

But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all—-the chordata, or vertebrates. There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal. Generally it is easy to tell them
apart. A ﬁsh, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a ﬁsh that swims upright or a man who never gets out of
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggled
with this sticky question for years before Sigafoos of
M.I.'l1 came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea-
ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it is a ﬁsh, it will refuse.
If it is homo sapiens, it will accept-and the more sapient,
the quicker. .

And now you know biology. And now, for the fourteenth
time, aloha.

* * * @1968, Max Shulman
The makers of Personna, The Electra-Coated blade,
have enjoyed bringing you another year of Old Max.

  Kent Tops Mitters, 10-8

by JERRY L. GRUEBER

The mitters are slated to play Buffalo today and a.doub'le-
header at Syracuse tomorrow, but if they play anything like
the way they played against Kent State last Monday, their trip will

be disastrous.

Kent State won 10-8. and was trouble from the very beginning.

In the first "inning. State second
baseman Tony Nappi singled to
- left on the first pitch, stole sec.-
ond base, and moved to third on

A —- (la ground out. Pro prospect Thur-

mond Munson followed with a
double over centerfielder George
McKenzie’s head, but was out try-
ing for third.

Two walks and a single pro-
duced the second run. and a dou-
ble stealmade the score 3-0. The

, next batter walked and with first

and second occupied, Kent State
pulled off another double steal.
But the lead runner scored when
second basemen Cliff B r o w n
threw the ball away.

By the time the inning ended,
Kent State was ahead 4-0 on three
hits, three walks, five stolen bases
and an error. This is not to men-

tion about three or four mental '

miscues that were not credited to
.—the mitters.

In the bottom of the third inn-
ing, the mitters helped Kent State
score two more runs. Munson
drilled another ball over McKen-
zie’s head for a triple. and scored
on a passed ball. With one out,
Ken Geisselman walked, stold sec-
ond, and scored on a double by
Mickey Fiorentino.

By the fifth inning. Kent State
had a 6-0 lead and seven stolen
bases. while the Panther baseball-
ers had only two infield hits and

sloppy fielding to show for them-
selves.

But before the Panthers finish-
ed batting in their half of the fifth
inning, the laughter of the amus-
ed Kent State players and fans
was silenced, as the visitors scored
seven times with two outs.

Needless to say. the mitters
blew the lead and the game, but
not before producing a few more
laughs. ‘

Kent State got another chance
to laugh when two Panther errors
in the seventh inning enabled the
home team to push four runs
across the plate.

But the mitters were also laugh-
ing. One reason was Dave Welty,
who relieved starter George Med-
ich in the fifth inning. Welty
picked two runners off base, and
just missed nabbing about four
others.

Welty and Howie Menich are
the probable starters for the dou-
bleheader at Syracuse, and foot-
baller George Medich will hurl
«against Buffalo.

“Medich will fly in Friday to
pitch against Buffalo.” explained
coach Bobby Lewis. “and then
he’ll fly back to Pittsburgh after
the game. He has to play in the
blue-gold spring football game
Saturday.”

 

Defense Can
Score Under
New Format

by ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor

Dave Hart’s most produc-
tive spring comes to an end
tomorrow, and the fruits of his
and many others’ efforts will be
on display in the ‘annual Blue-
Gold spring game.
Game time at Pitt Stadium is
1:30 p.m. and admission to stu-
dents is free with an ID card.

One major change will be in
effect this year in regards to the
way the game will be played. In-
stead of dividing into two squads
with an offense and defense on
each’; tomorrow the offensive unit
goesagainst the defensive unit.

“A lot of colleges do it this
way,” commented Hart in refer-
ence to the change. “Alabama,
for one, has 120 ballplayers and
no depth problems, but they do it
this way. We can try various of-
fensive and defensive combina-
tions this way.”

In order to maintain fan inter-
est, a scoring system has been de-
vised to give the defense points
for its efforts. Points will be
awarded as follows: one for forc-
ing the offense to punt, three for

recovering a fumble, intercepting_

for Tomorrow

HARD HITTING has been the main feature of all the spring drills.

Here, assistant coach Bob Timmons (left) gets his share. All the work

ends tomorrow, though, as the annual spring game changes its format.
The offense goes against the defense.

a pass, or blocking a punt or field
goal. The defense can also score
on a safety or with a touchdown.

“It’s a good way‘to score.” re-
marked Hart. “It won’t be boring
for the fans, and this way our best
goes against our best.”

The advantage of the new meth-
od of play is that leading candi-
dates for positions get equal time
under equal conditions. For in-

  
   

“INJURED DAVE Garnett (center) watches glumly as the Panther of-

fense works on plays that he would normally be running at tailback.
Garnett has missed most of spring practice with a bad knee, but might
see limited action in tomorrow’s game.

stance, both quarterbacks, Dave
Havern and Frank Gustine, will
be able to work with the first team
backfield or both with the second
team backfield. Tailbacks Denny
Ferris and Gary Cramer can both
run behind the same offensive
line, giving a more accurate re-
flection of their individual tal-
ents.

Defensively. on the other hand.
there is a wealth of linebackers.
Tomorrow the defensive coaches
can experiment with different
combinations. rather than split-
ting them up.

Mostly, we just want to see if
we can move the football.” said
Hartj “We’ll use a blend of the
pass and run.”

The team had trouble moving
the football in its final pre-game
scrimmage Wednesday. In the
first “-half,” the offense scored
only once — on Joe McCain’s 24-
yard field goal. Otherwise, the
defense stopped them cold.

A few scores came across in the
second, though shorter, “half.”
H a v e r n engineered a 70 — yard
drive, with Tony Esposito scoring
from two yards out. Havern con-
nected for one score with split
end Skip O r s z u la k . Orszulak
scampered 60 yards down th e
sideline with a short pass for one.
and Gustine fired 45 yards into
the end zone for the other.

Hart, his staff, and his players
are filled with optimism for the
upcoming season. They can begin
evaluating the progress of the first
phase of the new season tomor-
row. starting at 1:30.

will compete. Richey will run the mile and either
the half—mile or the two mile. and Salter will try
the high jump. triple jump, and broad jumps. Ban-
ner also expressed confidence in Jay Neyer and
Wayne Bodenheimer.

“Neyer has looked real good in the half mile.
and Bodenheirner has been throwing the javelin
consistently at 215’and 216 feet.” cited Banner.

The coach bases much of his optimism on the
improvement shown this past weekend at Quantico.
He also declares that his strong points tomorrow

  _ . .  ﬂgsgégggydﬁg

  
 

   

the high jump, triple jump, and broad jump. Thus,
quarter-miler Roger Holly, Richey, and Salter bear
much of the responsibility for a successful meet.

Banner said that he has a good squad. but their

overwhelming weakness is depth. For instance. Bob .

McElheny is forced to enter at least five events:
broad jump. high jump. triple jump. javelin. discus.
and possibly shotput.

“We‘re very thin" explained Banner. “We're
going to do a lot of doubling." The coach stated
that he can‘t really map any strategy for Wayne
State because of the depth problem as well as not
knowing which events are crucial.

“I haven’t even talked to their coach." Banner

-commented. “We have absolutely no information

about‘Wayne State." However. he added that to-

morrow’s dual meet will be good preparation for

the rugged quadrangular meet next weekend‘ at
 se. ’

Golf Team Defeats Ohio U. and Indiana State,

Gets Ready for Eastern Tourney at Princeton

by ED CONLEY

I Golf coach Rex Peery has more enthusiasm with regard to
his squad’s ability on the eve of "the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Association Tourney than he has had all spring.

The reason is the double victory the golfers captured Tuesday-at
the Shannopin Country Club course.

“Boy. that was something!" Peery remarked. “You never_saw
what it was like!" '

The excitement generated by the coach came after the team’s two
greatest wins. The three-team match between his Panthers, Ohio Uni-
versity, and Indiana State lPa.) wound up in a three-way tie. The med-
alist system of scoring used to break up such deadlocks was of no help
at all. The low scorers for each squad had identical scores of 73. Thus,
a sudden-death playoff was necessary.

The golfers involved were Greg Moore of Ohio U.. Dave Prosser
of Indiana State. and Pitt's Bill Bryan.

The first playoff hole was parred by all three duffers. Prosser
dropped out of the competition after the second “extra" hole. as he
bogied. The decision came on the third sudden death hole.

. Moore missed a short putt for his par, and Bryan came through
with the shot that meant two 4-3 victories for the golfers. The season
record now stands at five wins, six losses.

A POLlTlCAl. swm Touk
orsueoes  

will be conducted this summer by a professor of international
relations in the gradziate school of a well—known university.
A two week course in contemporary problems (in English)
at the Sorbonne will be supplemented by seminars with
leading scholars and statesmen (such as Ludwig Erhard, Enoch
Powell, MP, Prof. Count Bertrand de Jouvenal, Archduke Otto
von Habsburg) in 10 countries. Social activities with European
students (Oxrord Balls, etc.) will be included in this non.
regimented tour for intelligent students. For moreinformation,

Very pleased with Bryan‘s performance. Peery said. “Don't you
forget that boy. the hero of the day. He was great!"

That he was. and. he and the rest of the squad hope that they can
be just as great this weekend at Princeton. They'll have to be if they
want to come home with any honors.

The tourney, which begins tomorrow, will have 16 teams compet-
ing for the title that has gone to Penn State for the last two years.
Coach Joe Boyle’s teams have claimed four out of the last five EIGA
titles. »

Penn State will have the tourney's co-champs of last year. Frank
Guise and Jim Geiger. returning to defend their individual honors.
and could be considered slight favorites in the highly talented field.
which includes Columbia. Penn. Yale. Harvard. Army. Navy. Syra-
cuse. Temple. and host Princeton. Princeton may have some advantage
playing on the home course and could be a threat.

When asked to pick a possible champion. Peery said that he could
not do it. He did say. ,“Don't expect us to win.“ He added. “But. we
have high hopes of placing some."
