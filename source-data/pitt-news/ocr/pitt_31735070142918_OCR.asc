Oakland service could improve

!. . .1
Q__. ~ ‘

Staff Report

A proposed Port Authority overhaul
would eliminate and consolidate
some bus routes, but the changes
could improve the Oakland transit.

The proposal, part of the Author-
ity’s Transit Development Plan, calls
for the elimination of 15 routes and
the merging or renaming of an ad-

, ditional 58.

“People are concerned that one
day they’re going to wake up and
their route will be gone,”]im Ritchie,
a spokesman for the Port Author-
ity, said.

But, because Oakland is densely
populated, he said, Pitt students
living on or near campus wouldn’t
experience too many of the cuts.

The Authority’s plan calls for nine
new rapid routes, all of which will
run through Oakland. These buses
will run every three to four minutes
during rush hour, every eight to 10

‘ minutes during non-rush hour and

every 15 minutes in the evening.

“You pretty much won’t need a
schedule,” Ritchie said. “Even if you
miss a bus, you know another is com-
ing in three to four minutes.”

Ritchie said the buses will run
faster, because they won’t stop at
almost every comer, as many buses
currently do. -

Eight routes — the 61A through
61D and 71A through 71D — will
continue to run through Oakland
and Downtown. S

The 28X, which currently runs
through Oakland and Downtown
before going to the airport, will no
longer stop at Robinson Town Cen-
tre. The 28X~buses will run every

three to four minutes and will pro— .

vide racks for suitcases and other

One of the largest changes to the
Oakland service is the elimination
of the 59U, which goes to the Wa-
terfront. ' _

for the loss of the 59U, often voted

Proselytizing creates
controversy

Caitlyn Christensen
Staff Writer

enifer Pepling sees herselfas a
doctor who specializes in the
saving of souls.

Some might have seen her
handing out religious pamphlets on
the corner of Forbes Avenue and
South Bouquet Street just before

' school began.

“If you are not Christian, you are
going to hell,” Pepling said. “Imag-
ine a doctor not telling you that you
were about to die because he didn’t

want to ruin your day. If I have the ‘

solution to everlasting life, it would
be uncaring not to tell you.”

To some, her actions are part of a
religious tradition, one aimed at sav-
ingpeople from what they believe to
be condemnation; To others, they
are outdated and offensive.

Pitt professor Adolf Griinbaum,
from the department of history and
philosophy of science, said whether
a church proselytizes — or, to recruit
people to convert — depends on its
conviction about the afterlife.

“Some believe that there is no
redemption otherwise. The Roman
Catholic Church has a doctrine -—
Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus — ‘out-
side the church there is no salva-
tion,”’ Griinbaum said. “Judaism
avoids proselytizing. Islam does
proselytize, so does Christianity,
and both have used the sword.”

Villasenor hopes to
start a local chapter of
National Asian Peace
Officers’ Association

Michael Macagnone
Sta_ﬂ"Writer

Pitt police chief Tim Dela-
ney was looking for someone
like Mark Villasenor to help
round out his department.
Not only does “Officer Mark”
like to chat with the students on
upper campus —— “The worst is
when students go away for break
or holiday. It becomes like a
ghost town up here. I don’t like
boredom,” he said —- but he also
holds a unique place on the staff.
Villasenor, a 38-year-old Pitt
alumnus, is the only Asian-Amer-
ican officer in the Pitt police de-
partment and one ofthree in the
area. Only one Asian-American
police officer works for the city
police, and only one works for
the county sheriff’s department.
Delaney said he was search-
ing for an Asian-American of-
ficer to “bring a representation
that wasn’t there before” to
the estimated 1,300 Pitt stu-
dents who identify themselves
as an Asian or Pacific Islander.
David Harris, a law profes-
sor who teaches about police
behavior and regulation, said
it’s common for police "depart-
ments to try to recruit people
based on their ethnicities. Po-
lice departments value people
with certain language abilities
or cultural knowledge because

they help the department func-
tion more‘ effectively," he said.
“After 9/11 for example, many
police departments recruited
consultants, professional and
volunteer to help relate to the
Muslim community.” he said.
Villasenor added that, “A
police force should repre—
sent the community it serves.
“I don’t think the city of
Pittsburgh is doing a good job
[recruiting],” Villasenor said.
City police Chief Nathan Harp-
er said the city tries “to recruit
across all ethnicities to create a
diverse working police force of
which to better serve and rep-
resent the multi—cultural pop-
ulation of our communities.”
According to the 2000 census,
Asian people comprise 2.7 per-
cent of Pittsburgh’s population.
Villasenor said one of his goals
is to reach out to other Asian of-
ﬁcers in the tri-state area, which
includes Pennsylvania, Ohio and
West Virginia.

He attended a conference
sponsored by the National Asian
Peace Officers’ Association and
hopes to create a chapter in Pitts-
burgh.

The nearest chapter is in
New Jersey, he said, and adding
a local branch could help recruit

age people to host trade shows
and career fairs here, he said.

“Young Asians are often pulled
away from law enforcement by
family members. There’s an
ideology that Asians had to
become doctors, lawyers or go
into the computer field,” Vil-
lasenor said, adding that the
message of officers’ association

Pitt’s lone Asian copreaches out

is that “it’s okay to be Asian
and join law enforcement.”
Villasenor joined the Pitt police
in August of 2008. He decided to
pursue a career in law enforce-
ment after 10 years working as
a pharmaceutical representa-
tive for three different corpo-
rations. He said he did some
“soul searching” before decid-
ing to become a police ofﬁcer.

the Asian community,” he said.
At 37, Villasenor entered the
Allegheny County Police Acad-
emy, where the majority of his
classmates were in their 20s.

“It was mentally and physi-
cally exhausting every day,” Vil-
lasenor said. “People thought
I was crazy to make a career
change at 37 years old. Every-
body thought that I was too old,
but I turned their negative into
a positive, and that’s what kept

me going on every day,” he said.

The difficulty was reward-
ing in the end, said Villasenor.
“There is no typical day in law
enforcement, so it’s not a routine
that you go into the office from 8
to 5 and do the same redundant
thing, day in and day out,” he said.
Villasenor graduated in 1994
from the Pitt’s College of General
Studies with a bachelor’s degree
in sociology. He earned his mas-
ter’s degree in health services
administration from Barry Uni-
versity in 1997.

Religious leaders question evangelists’ pamphleteering

Evangelists 4 1

convert to afaith often do so because of a lack
of stability in their own lives.

“It’s people who feel rootless, who feel they
do not have a ﬁrm footing, who are ﬂoating
on the sea of their lives or feel psychologically
insecure who are often the most willing to
listen when others come with a big message
of conviction,” Griinbaum said.

Although he could not statistically evalu-
ate whether college students are more likely
to experience religious conversions, he said
they might be open to new experiences in
general.

“Presumably, college students are inter-
ested in exploring the world and being open
to new convictions,” Griinbaum said.

Pepling’s convictions, while not necessarily
original, were certainly strong. Her pamphlets
came in the_form of fake trillion-dollar bills,
featuring a caricature of President Barack
Obama and a religious message asking, “The
trillion-dollar question: Will you go to heaven
when you die?”

The pamphlet went on to ask for the
reader’s repentance from lying, stealing and
lust. Anything less will lead to eternal ﬁery
condemnation, it says.

Pepling, a Pitt alumna, said she does not
target a particular demographic with the
church’s message. She said she aims her mes-
sage toward anyone who is not “saved.”

“I don’t want anyone to go to hell,” Pepling
said.

Pepling said she thinks people who practice
Judaism, Islam or any non—Christian denomi-
nation are condemned.

“Before Jesus, anyone who trusted the
Messiah was coming went to heaven. Those
who denied Christ [was coming] went to hell,”
Pepling said.

Pepling’s pamphlets gave contact informa-
tion for the Dorseyville Alliance Church. But
Pastor Mike Brownﬁeld, who works there,
said that the church does not endorse the
pamphlets.

“I am not aware of [Pepling’s] position,
and I wouldn’t be able to reﬁite it or justify it,”
Brownﬁeld said. “If you read the scriptures,
you would see that it says Jesus Christ is the
way to truth and life,” Brownﬁeld said.

Brownﬁeld said the church did not orga-
nize the distribution of the trillion-dollar-bill
pamphlets, but individual church members
organized the efforts on their own.

“We have no formalized campaign,” Brown-
ﬁeld said, adding that he’d prefer the church’s
name be taken off the pamphlets.

The pamphlets are made by an evangelical ’

West Coast organization called “The Way of.
the Master.” According to the group’s website,
the ministry’s purpose is to “inspire and equip
Christians — to teach them how to share the

gospel  the wayJesus did.”

Aaron Weil, executive director of the Hillel
Jewish University Center, called the pamphlets’
message irrelevant.

“There are fanatics all over the world, in
every denomination,” he said. “How do you
relate to a fanatic? For aJew, this message is
an interesting concept, because Jews don’t
believe in hell. If someone says you’re going
to hell, and you don’t believe in hell, it’s not
much of a threa ”

“But I’m being glib,” Weil said. “I believe
her message is outdated, and especially out
of date with modern Christianity.”

He went on to say that Jewish people do
not proselytize because the act goes against
the denomination’s mission. ' '

“In Rabbinic law, if someone wants to con-
vert, the Rabbi should dismiss them three
times. Conversion is not the mission of our
covenant — the mission is that Jews are a
chosen people, not the chosen people, and part
of being chosen was not to be above‘ anyone
and not to try and convince others to join the
covenant. . .. —

“We were never supposed to conquer the
world,” Well said. -

Minister Brett Miller, of the Greater Pitts-
burgh Church of Christ, said that while his
congregation does promote church on Pitt’s
campus, it aims for a “loving” approach, pass-

 

ing out ﬂiers and invitations to Bible study
groups on campus and on Port Authority
buses.

“We welcome converts, if that’s what peo-
ple want, and we welcome those who just want
a place to worship,” Miller said.

His church focuses heavily on self-pro-
motion at the beginning of Pitt’s school year,
especially around the time of the activities
fair. He didn’t want to comment directly on
Pepling’s message, but said he generally ﬁnds
a “hellﬁre—and-brimstone approach inappro-
priate.” -

“I believe there is a heaven and hell, but I
believe trying to scare people with that mes-
sage is not kind, not loving and not helpﬁil,”
Miller said.

The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh practices

campus outreach. The organization was on I

campus before school started, passing out
copies of the Quran to interested students.
Outreach director Imam Abdusemih said
that Islam recruits but does not threaten.
“In Islam, there is nothing that says we
cannot proselytize,” Abdusemih said. “But
we are not going to beat you up with hellﬁre.
You say, ‘I am a good person because Islam

tells me to be a good person. i A
“What we do is indirect,” Abdusemih said.

"‘We show you who we are, we don’t tell. you

who we are.”

Proposal splits 59U into three routes

on which only buses, high-occupancy vehicle
lanes and light rail services can travel — would
receive a color and number according to their
destination. A Pi, P2 or P3, for example, would
run along an eastern busway. ‘

“Rapid” buses will be assigned the letter
“R” and a number. ,

The plan calls forthe Port Authority to drop
the letters on bus routes “wherever possible.”
The 54C, for example, could become the 54
South Side.

The Authority will add six new routes,
one of which will run from Lawrenceville to
Oakland.

Route and-service changes will begin this
March.

The Port Authority plans to add smart
cards andrfare boxes by “this time next year,”
Ritchie said. New fare collection boxes will‘act
more like vending machines, recognizing the
difference between different bills and coins.

- Pitt studentswill be among the ﬁrst people
to use Port Authority smart cards, which will
ﬁinction “like an EZ Pass for public transporta-
tion.” Users will load money onto their smart
cards and then ﬂash them in front of the fare
boxes before they board buses.

_ Ritchie said Pitt students will probably be
able to use their IDs as smart cards.

He said the Port Authority will use data
from smart cards to track which routes are

the most common with the goal of improving
service in the long term.

The Authority also said it hopes to add
transportation hubs where two routes meet,
hopefully sometime within the next three to
ﬁve years. .

“We should have done this a long time ago,”
Ritchie said.

The announcement of these changescomes
almost three years after the state Transporta-
tion and Funding Reform Commission recom-
mended the Authority audit its system, which

has been virtually the same since its inception _
in 1964. Gov. Ed Rendell created the commis-
sion injuly 2005 to study ways to improve the
state’s transportation system.

The Port Authority will hold a public hear-
ing on its plans from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday
at the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center, 112
Washington Place, Downtown. People who
want to testify at the hearing are encouraged
to pre—register by calling 412-566-5437.

The Authority’s board of directors plans to
vote on the proposal by the end of October.

Obama boiled until one House mem-
ber yelled, “You lie!” when Obama
said his plan wouldn’t cover illegal
immigrants. Most others waved the
House Republican health care plan
— closer to the length of a term pa-
perthanthe 1000-p1us—page Demo-
cratic bills. One Republican carried a
sign reading, “What bill?” in protest
to Obama’s claims.

explanation of what he expects from
health care reform. Claiming that do-
ing nothing means death and bank-
ruptcy grazed the scare tactics used
by his predecessor.

But this speech was a big deal. It
is like passing Social Security again.
Maybe bigger.

This will ﬁindamentally alter the
U.S. economy. According to Obama,
it is a $900 billion proposal, though
he said he refuses to sign abill that in-
creases the deﬁcit by even a dime.

Obama promised a lot in his
plan, probably more than is pos-
sible. However, he set a necessary
trajectory in a debate quickly pulling
an albatross. The speech will surely
marshal support and rekindle the
belly-ﬁres of some Democrats losing
the will to be dubbed Nazis for much
longer. Some proposals also reached
out to Republicans — Sen.John Mc-
Cain by name twice — though they
did little to hinder a prevailing air
that the House of Representatives
is devolving into the House of Com-
mons.

Every time Obama proposes

anything, he faces the vipers. Some ,

Their conduct was disrespectful,
often informed —— or misinformed
— by ignorance. Yet, it was inexo-
rably sincere. In their raucous be-
havior, the Republicans showcased
a fever for action.

Obama’s prescription is a re-
newed commitment to bipartisan-
ship and some principles that need
detailing in the days that follow. A
necessary vagueness ran through-
out the speech, as Obama favored
worthy, broad objectives over wonk
talk.

Among them is the requirement
that everyone carry basic health care
coverage, hopeﬁilly made affordable
by these reforms. Many students, the
“young and healthy” as Obama said,
might not think they need coverage
or are already covered by parents’
plans. But how many students or

their parents can’t afford even ba— n

sic coverage? How many lost their
coverage when they lost jobs in this
recession‘? Answer: Enough.

Obama’s bill sounds like it will
help. His speech rose to the occasion.
We’re sold on the idea. Now how?
And how soon?

Letters to the editor

To the Editor, ‘

Last week’s column, “Anarchy

in the U.P.,” by Giles Howard~in- ‘

cludes some laughable moments of
sensationalism and misconstrued
relays.

It’s one thing to disagree with
those who challenge the arrival of
the G-20 Summitin Pittsburgh,
people like state Sen.

Jim Ferlo, D-Highland. Park, in-
ternationally renowned political sci-
entist and author Howard Zinn and

‘ co -founder of Pittsburgh’s Thomas

Merton Center, Molly Rush — not to
mention whole organizations such
as the United Steel Workers, Code
Pink and Iraq Veterans Against the
War,‘ just to name a few.

But it’s another thing to paint a
blurredpicture of people or groups
simply for disagreeing with their
views, as Howard attempts to do
in his piece. ,

The G-20 Resistance Project’s
“Call to Action” never promotes‘ a
“physical disruption” of any uni-
versity’s activities, as stated by
Howard. , I C

It does, however, suggest chal-

lenging the status quo that so many
institutions ofhigher educationtrain
students to accept. This is the sort
of disruption Students forjustice in
Palestine advocates —— a mental dis-
ruption to the molded, proselytized

SJP has sponsored include voices of
radical Israelis who put themselves
on the front line every day as they
stand in solidarity with occupied
Palestinians, or mental disrup-
tions to the status quo by Palestin-

Although this is surely not my
sole criticism, I indeed refused to
answer Howard’s questions loaded
with stock material commonly used
by the not-so-fair—and—balanced Fox
News and the like.

 

This is the sort of disruption Students forjustice in Palestine

advocates — a mental disruption to the molded, proselytized

viewpoints that we are force-fed by
the mass media and many educa-
V tional outlets every day.

This is what we in SJP have been
doing since our inception by offer-
ing alternative viewpoints to the

,Israeli—Palestinian conﬂict, which
are so often silenced and margirial-
ized in the mainstream media an
in higher education. - . . “

' Some examples of these mental
disruptionsto the status quo that

ian businesswomen who challenge
the 60-plus—yearoccupat:ion of their
lands by supporting the Palestin-
ian economy through sustainable
activities.

Howard stated that my sole criti-
cism was that the G-20 “excluded
Iran and Venezuela from member-
ship in the group, even though both
states possessed large international
economies.” '

This is an outright lie.

Howard then began raising his
voice over the phone at me, even
though I kindly asked him to lower
his tone. '

My refusal to answer Howard’s

, question on whether the United

States sponsors international ter-
rorism is irrelevant.

I have traveled to many coun-
tries, always with politics guiding
my way, and the equating of the
United States with international ter-

rorism has been audible injordan,
Egypt, Palestine, Israel, Indonesia
and Mexico.

Because Howard’s tactics were
so elementary, I was unable to relay
this point before the conversation
ended.

Howard calls it “disgusting” that
student activities’ fees fund S]P’s ac-

I tivities. Does Howard, for example,

also ﬁnd it disgusting that these fees
have gone to support Ann Coulter’s
presence on campus —— a blatant
homophobe and Islamophobe who
said, “We should invade their coun-
tries, kill their leaders and convert
them to Christianity?”

SJP’s goal has always been to
“educate students and community
about the Middle East” and to “en—
courage all groups to take part in our
pro-peace organization.”

It seems that Howard has put
forth another attempt at degrading
something with which he simply
does not agree.

Dead Milkmen frontman comes to Pittsburgh

Joe Jack Talcum, of The Dead Milkmen, will headline a three— part concert Sept. 10.

Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer

There are stage names, and there are
bizarre stage names. Then, there are
stage names inspired by baby pow-
der.

Guess into which categoryjoejack
Talcum falls?

The frontrnan of the ’80s punk-
rock band The Dead Milkmen chose
to shed the moniker Joe Genaro in
favor of something a little more eclec-
tic when hewas developingThe Dead
Milkmen in high school.

“I needed some random last name
for the character, andl saw some baby
powder and thought, ‘Hey, how about
Talcum‘? People tookweird last names
then. You had to pick a stupid, kooky
one,” he said. «

The name stuck when it came

. time to release The Dead Milkmen’s

ﬁrst album and has since appeared
on Talcum’s multitudes of recording
projects.

In his current acoustic solo act,
Talcum is touringwith The Bassturd,
whom he described as a “one man
hip-hop electronic extravaganza,”

and Samuel Locke—Ward vs. Darren
Brown, which is a singer-songwriter
performance art duo.

All three acts will make appear-

ances at Pittsburgh’s Rex Theatre '

Sept. 10.

Talcum is currently promotinghis
most recent album, Live in the Studio,
a tribute to live performance.

“We brought in a small audience
to the studio so we could record in
a more pristine environment than a
club but still have that live feel,” he
said.

The 14—track album includes some
new material, as well as several Dead
Milkmen songs rearranged as acous-
tic, including one of its most popular
songs: “Punk Rock Gir .”

Talcum said he enjoyed rearrang-
ing his older music, especially tracks
for which he wrote the music but
didn’t sing.

The remixes are popular and have
been well received by audiences.

“People who know The Dead Milk-
menwould knowthese songs, butalot
of people who come to shows don’t
knowthern atallandstillenjoy them,”
he said.

Dead Milkmenfans will be excited
to knowthat the band has reunited
and isworking on new material, which
Talcum said will be available soon.

Although he always tends to have
a few songs he’s working on, Talcum
said he no longer writes on a regular
basis like he did in the ’8os and ’90s.

“I used to sit down andthinkthat
I’d better have a song by the end of
the day or I won’t feel like I’ve accom-
plished anything,” he said. V

“I’d use gimmicks, like taking a
chord structure from other songs and
changing the rhythm — anything to
meet album deadlines and spur the
creative juices.” '

Writing and performing as a solo
artist made Talcum’s compositions
more self—sufﬁcient.

He said that when he was writing
and perforrningwith The Dead Milk-
men, he would “leave holes, knowing
that thebass would do somethinghere
or thatthere might be keyboardto ﬁll
it out, and then I’d see if the vocal parts
would change it. I’d know it could take

any number of twists and turns with '

other collaborative input.”

Indie — pop albums catchy, but unremarkable

Band: Bad Veins _

Album: Bad I/ez'n.r

Grade: B

Record Label: Dangerbird
Records

Sounds Like: The Fray, Race
the Ghost

Riddle me this: Why would
an album be named Bad Veins
if it doesn’t qualify as “had”
anything?

Tucked away inside a CD
case is the catchy self-titled
release from indie duo Bad
Veins.

Between the two musicians
come 10 songs of interest to
the ear.

The duo’s musical style is

varied. One song opens with a
drum march and another with
a soft, feminine vocal demon-
stration.

Some take on interesting
sounds from multiple instru-
ments, such as the harmonica,
brass and some string instru-
ments.

In the end, each song has its
own ﬂare, but each song also
has the uniting feature of a dis-
tinct and desirable beat.

Keeping up with its instru-
ments, the band’s lyrics are
certainly not of the highest
quality, but at the same time,
they are more satisfying to the
ear than a bad pop song.

Personal tastes will either
give the singers the thumbs-up
or thumbs—down.

At least the instruments
are set.

Band:Fun

Album: Aim and Ignite '

Label: Nettwerk

Grade: B+

Rocks Like: The Format, a less
electric Electric Touch

Fun’s debut album, Aim and Ignite,
belies its somewhat threatening
title — it’s hard tofeel like the
band members intended to aim
much more than a water gun -
and even then without malicious
intent.

. Not so much bubbly as actually
composed of bubbles, this ultra-
light pop—rock group crafts an in-
triguing, yet somehow ultimately
unsatisfying sound. Clichéd beats
and worn-out a cappella intros

take the place of anything fresh
or experimental.

Many songs test listeners’
patience by needlessly repeating
choruses and dragging past the
four—minute mark, like “Take Your
Time (Coming Home),” which lasts
nearly eight minutes.

An eerie and mocking singsong

effect is present in several tracks, '

most noticeably in “At Least I’m

' Not As Sad (As I Used to Be),”

which juxtaposes strangely with
the mood of the album.

The lyrics are discernible and
predominately optimistic, but the
plotlines of most tracks veer to
an extent that’s troublesome to
anyone interested in discerning
meaning.

Aim and Ignite is hardly mu-
sical composition at its ﬁnest,
but any listener would be hard-
pressed to say it isn’t fun.

But neither the country’s small size, nor

to the Future,” Talcum said, “Itwas so much fun!
It feels like music is a huge part of Alaskan lives,
because winters are so long and there’s nothing
to do when it’s dark all the time. So they pick up
violins or mandolins or whatever.

They have a mean acoustic-music scene, and
Sarah Palin is right on the money when shetalks
about how beautiﬁil it is there.”

The Rex Theatre performance will be pre-
sented in coordination with a screening of “Let

Them Know,” a documentary on BYO Records
and the band Youth Brigade.

Talcum was not involved with the ﬁlm, but
said, “I was into the whole indie punk rock scene

The movie will rimfrom 7:30 to 9 p.m., and

r of Panthers make their comeback

After season—ending injuries last season, Matt
Firster and Ryan Brode are back with the team

\

Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

You often hear that injuries are
a part of the game. For the Pitt
men’s soccer team last season, the
Panthers were of the unfortunate
variety.

In the last game of the pre-
season against Penn State, senior

A midﬁelder Matt Firster dribbled
V the ball and said he felt he might

have tweaked his quad muscle.

Hoping it was nothing, Firster
said he learned the following game
that he had endured a tear, which
made him miss the rest of the sea-
son and red shirt.

It was a huge blow to the team,
and three games into the season
against Duquesne, sophomore
Ryan Brode launched for a ball and
came down with what he said felt
like a groin injury.

Brode bought some time, hop-
ing the pain might subside — it
didn’t.

» The next game, Brode said he
felt more bothered with the pain
and ultimately learned he had
pulled his groin, causing the Pan-
thers to add another player to the

injury list. _

“It was very depressing,” First-
er said. ‘.‘I never really got hurt like
that before, but I knew that ev-
erything the trainers were putting
me through would get me back to
tip—top shape.”

As for the team, it managed to
stay aﬂoat in the earlier part of the
season and even catapulted to one
of its best starts in history. The
Panthers jumped out to a 5-1-1 re-
cord, including a 1-0 win over then
No. 20-ranked Rutgers.

But as Pitt ran into a stretch of
competitive Big East conference
games, losing the injured players
started to affect the team’s overall
performance.

Trainers would rehabilitate the
injuries, but nothing could heal the
injured players’ pain of watching
the team struggle and knowing
they couldn’t contribute.

“It was absolutely terrible,”
Firster said.

- Brode agreed.

“I started every game besides
my ﬁrst one freshman year,” he
said. “I played every minute with
the team, and not being able to
help [on the ﬁeld] was awful.”

The injuries to both players took

Tequila said she couldn’t have been

Notebook: i
Boos,
Gunn and

Staff‘ Writer

Redshirt senior Bill Stull and Pitt’s
quarterback situation were popu-
lar topics around the football pro-
gram throughout the offseami
and training camp.

Now, one game and a smat-
tering of boos later, the focus re-
mains on the signal caller.

It didn’t take long for Stull
to receive some sour feedback.
Patches of fans were disgruntled
after Pitt’s ﬁrst offensive series
of the game.

Head coach Dave Wannstedt
stood by his starting quarterback’s
performance when talking to the
media on Tuesday. - -tr‘

“Managing the game, he was
good, getting the plays in, [get-
ting] in and out of the huddle
[with] no delays [or] some of
those crazy things that happen in
early games,” Wannstedt said. “I
was pleased with [Stull]. He didn’t
make any major [mistakes]. It was
a good start for him.”

Stull’s passing numbers don’t
indicate a subpar performance. He
completed 11 of 16 passes for 123
yards, while throwing two touch‘-
downs and one interception —-— an
interception that Wannstedt said
was both Stull’s and wide receiver
Cedric McGee’s error.

After Saturday’s contest,
Wannstedt indicated his disap-
pointment with Stull’s treat-
ment on his home ﬁeld. Tuesday,
Wannstedt said Stull did “ex-
tremely well” while handling a
difficult situation.

“I think he’s been very honest
with what he’s trying to do and His
approach,” Wannstedt said. “He’s
worked extremely hard all sum-
mer and all camp. He’s doing the
best that he can do. That’s what
you expect of him.”

Wannstedt also said he plans to
give redshirt freshman Tino Sun-

during Pitt’s trip to Buffalo. Sunseri went
5-8 for 80 yards and tossed a touchdown
pass to Aundre Wright after getting an op-
portunity to play in the second half against
Youngstown State.

One thing is certain: Both Stull and
Sunseri will get a negative reaction from
stadium—goers this Saturday regardless of
their performances.

Replacing All-American middle line-
backer Scott McKillop can seem a daunting
task, but it’s not the most testing circum-
stance that sixth-year senior Adam Gunn
has had to deal with this season.

When Gunn took the ﬁeld against
Youngstown State on Saturday, it was the
ﬁrst action he had seen since suffering a
broken neck during last year’s season-
opening loss to Bowling Green.

high eight tackles and two sacks for the

Hutchins converted all ﬁve of his

double duty against Youngstown State? V

The scientiﬁc term for what Marquez does is

lets himhit the gloves harder, work the speedbag
faster and hopefully take down Mayweatherjr.

Now, I’m aware of the obscurity of some ath-
lete’s rituals. They are highly habitual creatures
with bizarre superstitions.

I’ve heard of former outﬁelder Moises Alou
peeing on his hands to create calluses to hitwith-
out batting gloves. I let that one slide.

But drinking it? .

_ I know Kevin Costner did it in “Water World,”
but a) that movie was awful and b) he at least
puriﬁed it ﬁrst.

' Ifyou don’t wantto take myword for it, there
are ample clips ﬂoating around the Internet
where you can witness it ﬁrsthand. Trust me,
it’s a treat.

It also begs the question: What other athletes
are doing this?

No way it’s only Marquez. I would suggest"
Merriman, butl already know he prefers another
drink for which Mexico is famous: Tequila.

So, what’s it goingto be? I’m ready for another,

skill out of the lineup, but in Brode’s case, an
element of leadership was missed.

“I guess we lost some seniority [when
I went down],” Brode said. “But I tried to
do whatever I could to help out with the
leadership and bestow whatever knowledge
or experience I had with some of the other
younger guys.”

With both players back in the lineup, head
coach Joe Luxbacher and the other players
said they see the value of depth.

Prior to the season opener last week,

 

Luxbacher emphasized the importance of
having players come off the bench and con—
tribute, which proved to be the case in the
Panthers’ ﬁrst victory of the season.

That luxury wasn’t available last season,
as many players were thrust into unfamiliar
starting roles.

But the Panthers grew stronger from
their adversity.

The 2009-10 season is just getting un-
derway, so both players still have time to
recover and contribute.

In the meantime, both Firster and Brode
said they are conﬁdent with their progress
and the likelihood that their performance
will reveal they haven’t missed a beat.

“I probably have more expectations for
myself now,” Brode said, while Firster said
he’s “not hesitant one bit.” <-

With skill, leadership and undeniabl
toughness back in the lineup, the Panthers
are poised to avenge last season’s Big East
downfall and exceed expectations in the
process.
