Business index
In City, District
Hits 939 High

' iauéihegs activity in the Pittsburgh

district roselast week to the highest
level since November, 1937, the Uni-

versity Bureau of Business Research_

reported today.

The index reached 86.8 per cent _of
;the 1923-25 seasonal average.

1 Improved retail trade and an in-
‘crease in car loadings were responsi-
ble for the increase, counterbalanc-
ing a moderate drop in steel ingot
and electric power production. A
signiﬁcant increase in department
store sales accounted for nearly all
the gain in the trade index.

In a monthly summary bulletin,
the Bureau reports that Pittsburgh
business moved gradually upward
during February, recovering most of
the setback in December and Jan-
uary. .

Paced by a continued increase in
industrial production, the Bureau
predicts that business in the district
appears to be headed for new high
ground. .

Disruption of classes iii the low-
er ﬂoor of the Cathedral, in State
and Thaw halls, and in the School
of Dentistry was the only" concrete
result of the noisy student’ demon-
stration Friday in protest against
the resignation of Dr. John B. Suth-
erland“a’s"‘h’ead football coach. .

Property damage in the Cathedral
to‘ Ray-
of

.',-was ~- negligible, ziccordiiig
‘_mond' L. Coss, “superintendent
fbuildings and grounds. ‘
Police at the Oakland station re-

ficeived no report of trouble of any

‘ikind. Several ofﬁcers from radio’
gears" arrived in the Cathedral long

"after the demonstration had started; .

they took no action. -
No accurate report on the number
of students participating in the dem-

liam Daufenbach, assistant to the
dean of men, was unable to estimate
the size of the protesting mob.

Many students in -the Cathedral re-
fused to join in the demonstration.
In several instances‘, the leaders of
the mob were unable to induce mem-
bers of classes to leave. Afternoon
classes were not affected.

Placards carried by the strikers
carried statements such as “Nuts to
Weber-’s Palace Politics,” “Back to
Iowa,” and “Big John and Little John
Must Go.” -_ ,

Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor
of the University, did not witness the
demonstration. He was in New Jer-'
sey Friday for a speaking engage-'1

ment at Rutgers university.

Independents Schedule

First Nominating Caucus 

Group to Suggest I 

SF A Candidates
At Open Meeting

Members of the Independent party
will meet in 144 Cathedral on Wed-
nesday at 12:30 o’clock to form the
ﬁrst nominating convention ever held
on campus.

Designed for the purpose of select-
ing candidates for junior and senior
seats in the Student Faculty Associa-
tion assembly, the convention will
name 12 men and six women to rep-
resent the party. Persons chosen at
Wednesday’s meeting will then ﬁle
applications with the SFA executive
committee for nomination at the gen-
eral student elections on April 22.

Directing the organizations of the

;.party is its executive committee made
' up of Ed Springer, C39; Jack Hoevel—

er, C40;_J_. Karl S.tark, C40; Clarence
Shepard, BA40; Adele Yorio, C41;
Rugy Aldisert, C41; and Milton Mos-
kovitz, C42._

In a statement made by the execu-
tive committee, the party announced
that the organization has no quarrel
with fraternity men and women as
personalities. -

“We differ only with their ways of
doing things. We disapprove of third-
floor—back-room slate ﬁxing and
nominating condidates,” it declared.

Procedure at Wednesday’s conven-
tion will probably consist of a key
note address by one of the party’s
members, in which the party’s pro-
gram will be reviewed.

“Wedn_esday’s convention marks
the ﬁrst attempt to nominate candi-
dates for SFA which is patterned on
a democratic basis,” states Hoeveler.

The Independent party was or-
ganized in the fall of last year. At
its second meeting it adopted a plat-
form favoring “merit, not political

‘ deals, as a basis of student positions.”

That ‘Morning After’

Hangover Again

T HE tumult and the shoutiilg have died. But the
captains and the kings have not departed.

All is once more quiet 011 the Commons Room
front. “Big John” and “Little John,” as the S3_.V'
ing goes, are safely esconced in their ﬁrst ﬂoor suite
of offices; some faculty members and students have

, slickod back their ruﬁicd hair and rolled down their

sleeves and are back at the old routine; and the

. entire country has read with relish another unsa-
vory chapter in the career of a University which
has been the answer to a city cditor’s prayer.

Now, with cooler heads more abundant, is ‘the
time to appraise the situation and to determine Just
what, if anything the demonstration accomphshed.

.\Ve, whose editorial remarks have been wldely
quoted as the impetus of Friday ’s affair, can see
only the following results:

(1) A tremendous amount of uilfavorable na-
tion-wide publicity. On this score, some suspi-

- cion has been expressed that certain professional
-newspapcrinen played a part in promoting the
wall<o11t' for quite obvious reasons.

(2) A general “steain blowing-off” session,
conducted in immature and inane fashion and
actually about two notches below an ordinary
football strike in manner of execution.

‘ (3) An unnecessary antagonizing of the great

I majority of students and faculty who were on
the same side of the fence, but.‘ who sincerely and
conscientioilsly disagreed with the methods and
tactics of the demonstrators.

’l‘hat. these are all negative results . . . results
which outweighed the positive factors, we have
little doubt. Yet it seems to us a mistake to dismiss

' the incident so liglitly, as far as positive effects and

" importance are concerned.

To tag the dc111o1'1strat.iou as a circulation-get-

- ting scheme on the part of downtown newspaper-
men is to ovcr-simplify the situation. Many sin-
ccrc students were in on the wild doings, honest‘ in

. their bcblief that such :1 form of protest. was the
 only way in which attention could be focused on

2 what Dr. Sutherland calls “intolerable conditions,”
. and what the News termed “blundering and short-

‘ sighted administration.”
Attention, no doubt was focused. But was it

>3? #15

i focused on the vital underlying University-wide

,‘lSSllE‘S, or once more upon the narrow and over-
-‘ worked conﬁnes of athletic policy and clashes of
.pcrsonalitics‘? The answer might be indicated by a
3 cartoon appearing in the local morning paper the

Friday's demonstration. though motivated by
deeper, more fundamental issues, seemed generally
to emphasize the more supei-'f1cial aspects of the sit-
uation. It tended to overlook more or less color-

and shallow issues.
Lasting results can only be achieved by a. saner,
more rational approach to the problems, by at-
tempting to keep the Universit_v’s good eye open
without going to the cxtrcme of f11rtl1er blacken-

The whole ﬁasco. we are convinced, was a result
of diffcreiit. reactions to The same underlying prob-
lem. On both sides. it was merely an expression of
futility . . a spirit’ of mass futility on the part
of demonstrators, of individual futility by those
opposed
It was that old “\Vell, what can we do about
it?" attitude . . . an attitude which seems to indi-
cate pretty well the general state of morale at the
University.
If University officials want honestly to remedy
the responsible conditions, they will not dismiss
‘ Friday’s action as the emotional response of a mi-
_\:nority_ of students; they will rather be alarmed at

this state of apathetic futility, and take immediate
_' steps. to restore conﬁdence and morale.-

Brown Study . . .,

By Robert Brown

It is a crying shame that a few hundred screaming
boobies made the student body the Number 1 laughing
stock of the country, simply because a few gentlemen
who wear eyeshades in the editorial offices of the down-
town papers were short of hot copy.

Newspaper publishers are the most leary gentlemen
in the world when it comes to strikes—in their own of-
fices. But the representatives of
Messrs. Hearst, Howard and Block
had themselves one swell time in
sponsoring one of the most dis-
graceful things that ever happened
at the University.

For the Friday ﬁasco was a
trumped up affair. There was lit-
tle sentiment for a strike. A strike
is legitimate in a coal mining
town or in a sweatshop. It is the
only way these people have to ex-
press themselves.

But a University student is sup-
posed to be a little different. I am granting that every-
one was sore about the Sutherland incident that seems to
be another step in the crazy series of events that have
kept this a merry place for years.

I think I am typical of most students when it comes
to football. I go to all the games. I wolf down hotdogs
and scream loudly when Mr. Goldberg starts to roll off
yards, and at sporadic intervals I look very wise and
comment on a “nice tackle block” or some such gibber-
ish to the dewy-eyed damsel sitting beside me.

I realize what part football has played in building up
the University, and I am sorry to see Sutherland gone.
But I also think a strike was the worst thing that could
help express a resentment felt by practically every one
on the campus.

 

Brown

And to have the downtown papers step in and help it
makes me boil. The stories all last week were colored
up. Photographers were sitting in the Common Room
every morning waiting for something to pop. And they
ﬁnally got a comparative handful to go in for the most
damnable foolishness that has happened since the Ca-
thedral was built.

It was great copy. The nation’s readers must have
gotten a pleasurable kick out of the telephoto pictures
showing urban college students, who wear business suits
and ride street cars and buy 35 cent lunches suddenly
turned into a mob of hooting, uncontrolled lunatics who
mouthed platitudes in the morning and then went down
to see Benny Goodman in the afternoon.

No effort to analyze existing problems. No confer-
ences. No attempt to draw up plans that might lead to
settlement of the difficulties that are here.

It was just a ﬁeld holiday for managing editors and
radio commentators all over the country and a noisy
holiday for a few hundred students who like to open
their mouths and yell.

Perhaps you have noticed the lack of “oh, Jane
how lovely that dress looks” and “where did you get
that darling hat” and ‘‘That’s an adorable compact”

during the past wk. . . . it is all because the gals are

forbidden to talk to the rushecs—they go around now
in silent prayer and a gleam of hope in their eyes. We
understand that the Nancy Hiles, Tykie Grennan and
Betty Teal combine can render “Rocket for Me” like
it has never been did before.

have tagged . . . Mary McCahi1l who smiled on the arm

that Jack Keller, Pitt exit is warbling with Joe Ravelli’s
orchestra currently at the New Penn——they say Jack is

tax. Those two potential campus smoothies, Tom
Hart and Marsh Nesbitt were reported in the vicinity
of the PCW brawl at the Schenley and later looked
longingly at the couples at the I-F . . on Fri. last

. just a case of two heartbreakers at large. I
notice a change to “dunce cap” drinking cups in the
Cathedral . . and wonder whether Building and
Grounds gets a special rate on them if they are for
colleges or am I just self-conscious.

Larry Rothman, the lad who put the corn in Cornet
has been leading the C and G boys in song to cheer them
for the grueling affair of Graduate Club tryouts—while
we hear that the Pitt Band has come out for a specialty

In The lV[ail

Editor, The Pitt News:

“Back to Iowa,” and similar pla-'

cards were paraded around campus
Friday. A mob of students canvassed
floors of the Cathedral, breaking up
numerous class sessions. This, ac-
cording to downtown papers, was
the manifestation of the student
body’s sentiment on the Sutherland
episode. H

Yet, did these striking students
know what they wanted‘? Were they
rational in thought and action? Cer-
tainly not———this was evidenced by the
number of students who saw the fu-
tility of striking, and tried to stay in
their classes.

We all know that the “de-empha-
sis” policy is inconsistent; that is,
that one of the tenets of that code is
non-subsidization and yet practically
every one of the teams on our foot-
ball schedule are schools which open-
ly or secretly subsidize their players.
We all liked “Jock” and hated to see
him leave the University.

But, how are such crises settled,
by force or by logical, clear reason-
ing? The latter, of course, not by
crowding the Commons Room with
students—not by giving the down-
town papers a good chance to in-
crease circulation.

Several activities leaders, who saw
the futility of the strike, tried to stay
in class, and were censured by a
handful of rabble-rousers. We are
in sympathy with the strike’s mo-
tive, but can’t we ﬁnd a more con-
structive way of expressing our lean-
ings?

Sincerely,
JERRY HAHN,» C41.

Incidentally, Michele, this ﬁve-

Piquant and charming, Michele,
who only three years ago ran away
from home to go on the stage, is an
accomplished actress. It should be
interesting to wa_tch her on her way
to international fame.

. PANTHER
. PA TTER

By Bill McElwav'n

Doc Carlson’s basketball team ended another season on Satur-
dav. And once again something seems to have gone wrong with the
Ddctor’s pet slogan, “\Vin ’em all.” The Glamor Boys or Kute Kids
-or whatever you choose to call them deﬁnitely did not win ’em all.

But the season was far from a failure. The untried sophomores
of 1939 at least stayed on the upper side of .500, something the veteran
1938 club couldn’t manage. At times, the Panthers looked just about
the class of the Eastern Conference. At other times, they looked as
though they didn’t belong in the Conference at all.

'I‘hey made mistakes, plenty of them. But the odds are heavily
against a repetition of those mistakes next year. Almost the entire
squad will return to the campus next fall. Of the traveling squad,
only Lawry -will be missing.

F rosh Coming Up

Instead of starting from scratch as he did this season, Carlson
will be able to ﬁgure deﬁnitely on using such keymen as Eddie‘St;ra-
loski, Mel Port, Larry Paﬁrath, and George Kocheran, then ﬁlling
the extra position with Sam Milanovich, Jack Scherer, Jim Klein, Bob.
Johnson, Dan Vjunovic, John Pataky, or Al Reeves.

Then, too, Paul Zelifuss had another strong freshman team the
past year. From it, Carlson should take several boys who are just
-about ready for varsity jobs. With a team two deep in veterans,
‘Doc can push ahead his new men as quickly or as slowly as he cares to.

Two or three of the frosh probably won’t need pushing. Ziol-
okowski looks ready to step into the ﬁrst ranks now, while Collins
and Egan aren’t far behind him. Cohen and Jersie, if they become
eligible, will be valuable people to have around. The former would
provide a -ﬁghting spark that was seldom found in the 1939 Panthers.

The schedule next year will include several clubs not‘ played
this year and drop some of the present crop. The most noticeable
change is the substitution of VVaynesburg and Geneva for Temple
and Georgetown. The clifﬁculties in scheduling the latter two clubs
and the general lack of interest in them around Pittsburgh was the
primary cause for Pitt’s withdrawal from the Eastern Conference
and the loop ’s subsequent el foldo.

Navy On New Schedule

The western trip will as usual include Northwestern but Butler
and Ohio State are back on the schedule for next year. The success of
the Cornell game this year has resulted in the scheduling of a game
with the Ivy Leaguers on their own ﬂoor.

A signiﬁcant newcomer is Navy. \Vhile it is just a possibility,
Pitt followers are wondering whether the game indicates the begin-
ning of a swing back to the Micldies and Cadets in other sports.
Clashes bet'wcen the Panthers and a service team in any sport have
always been popular with local fans.

Missing from the 1939-40 slate is Duquesne. Long a city rival,
the Dukes, until this year, always put on a whiz bang of a game
with Pitt. The 1939 Bluff crew of ﬁve seasoned sophs romped away
from the Panthers as it did from almost everyone else on its schedule.

Carnegie Tech, Penn State, and \Vest Virginia, the traditional
district rivals, will be back as will VVest'minster, a ball club that ’s
always tough. The Tartans will have an almost exclusively senior
brigade next year but State and the l\/lountaineers will lose several
stars by graduation and will have to rely on new men to ﬁll the holes.

Edmunds and Ruskin are teamed
at the forwards. The former has
been an All Fraternity choice for two
years and was a steadying factor in
the Phi Gam attack all year.
RUSKIN SCORING ACE

Ruskin, although playing against

weaker teams than Edmunds, still
was a constant scoring threat. His
best outbursts were 23 points against
the Ramblers and an unbelievable 58
point splurge against Kappa Alpha
Psi.

Jack Glenn led the champion Phi
Kaps in scoring from his pivot post
and is named as center of the All
Stars, while Joe Kristufek and Croker
form the guard combination.

Kristufek,
basketballer, was probably the ﬁnest
performer in any league. Playing at
guard, he managed to ring up plenty
-of points without sacriﬁcing his de-
fensive value.

‘SECOND TEAM PICKED

Second team honors go to Joe Dunn
-of the Newmans, Andy Johnson of
the Ramblers, Pitt C1ub’s Tratar,
George Davies, PiKA ball hawk; and
Don Cerferatti, SAE hot-shot.

Johnson, in addition to his referee-
ing, was player manager of the
Rambler ﬁve and looked good at both
jobs. His fellow ofﬁcials, it should be
said, picked him entirely on merit.

Dunn ran second to Kristufek in
the Newmans’ scoring and was a fair-
ly good ball handler. Tratar, a rangy
boy, combined a certain amount of
scoring ability with neat ﬂoor work.

Ceferatti and Davies both were
high scorers. The latter has twice
been an All Fraternity selection.
Ceferatti’s work alone accounted for
all of Sigma Chi’s victories.-

Duquesne Ice Team Dominates

News’ All-City Hockey Choices

By Kal K8-lwary

College hockey has taken a. hold
here. And because the ice sport
has established itself on a par with
basketball, The News, for the very
ﬁrst time, presents an All—City
Hockey Team, representing Car-
negie Tech, Duquesne and Pitt.

Duquesne’s hockey team, like its
basketball ﬁve, easily was the .most
potent outﬁt in the city loop, and,
consequently, places the most men on
the first or starting sextet. Pitt is
next in line for the All-City honors,
with Tech the weakest ‘entry in the
local league. _

The ﬁrst or starting team places
Dick Friday, Pitt, and Walter McGill,
Duquesne, at wing;
Bill Vance, Du-
quesne, at center; 
Bob Schooley, Pitt, A
and Dick Scully,

Duquesne, at .de- ;
and Fred

fense,

Fieler, Tech, at
goalie.

The second or

alternate team:
Harry Foster and
R o g e r Schaefer,
Duquesne, wings;
Irv Artz, Pitt, cen-
ter; Billy Gold-
smith, Tech, and
Walt Lovett, Pitt, defense, and Alex
Iungerich, Duquesne, goalie.

Two rugged icemen, who could
have been chosen for their splendid
team play alone are, Friday, Pitt and
Vance,‘Duquesne. Friday can be just
as dazzling on solo spurts down the
frozen ﬂoor as any puckman in the
city, but he prefers to spend most of
his energy and talent working as a
team player. He has a ﬁne hockey
heart and is, in comparison to other
district players, sportingly calm and
reserved. Friday is also one of the
fastest skaters in the Eastern League.

The bespectacled, chunky Vance is,
without question, the smoothest skater
hereabouts. With-
out him the Dukes
, would be a decid-
‘ -edly Weaker outﬁt.
Vance handles
himself like a pro-
fessional. His neat
weaving, h i din g
the puck on dashes
and checking is al-
most unbelievable
for a college hock-
ey performer. Be-
cause of his out-
standing superior-
ity and grand com-
petitive s p i r i t
Vance is named captain of this myth-
ical six.

Duquesne’s main goal threat, Mc-
Gill, selected as Friday’s wing part-
ner, is a spectacular type of player.
He even looks good falling down.
He’s a deceptive puck pusher with a
keen net eye.

In Squash Tourneys

By Joe Kristufek

iWilliam C. Swartz, J r., ChE41, is one of the ﬁnest squash ‘players
in the United States. Although he started to play squash just three
years ago, Billy has already played in a national tournament and*has
represented the United States in international competition.

Two months ago he representedthe United States in the Lapham
Trophy Tournament held annually between this country and Canada.

Billy, playing number two, won his
match.

In the National Open, held in New
York early this year, he lost to Tony
Iannicelli, World’s Open Squash
champion, after one of the hardest
battles of the tournament. Each won
two games, then Iannicelli won the
ﬁfth and deciding game by a 15-13
score.

RECORD IMPRESSIVE

Such rapid rise in national squash
competition is unusual, for most ace
squash players are seasoned veter-
ans. The red-headed Swartz has
constantly been called away from
campus to represent Pittsburgh in
tournaments. Besides representing
Pittsburgh twice in National Amateur
tournaments, once -in Baltimore and

a defense berth along with the big,

bobbing Scully, Duquesne. Pitt’s
Captain Schooley compares to -Mc-
Gill, but is more versatile and more
dependable. He
plays either wing
or defense equally
well. He’s the
chance—taker a n d
scrapper on the
Panther team.
Scully joined the
Bluff forces almost.
midway in the
season, but imme-
diately earned the
praise of regular
hockey fans. He’s
older than the
o t h e r collegiate
skaters and his
greater experience tells a proﬁtable
story for the Dukes. He, like
Schooley, ﬁnds himself at home at
wing or defense.

Awarding the goalie post was more
diﬁicult than any other position.
Fieler, Tech, and Iungerich, Du-
quesne, are almost on a par, but I be-
lieve the Tartan has a slight edge.
Fieler, because he is the more alert
of the two, is appointed to the start-
ing crew. Iungerich was of the alter-
nate six to make a strong bid for the
regular team.

ship, the city Class B championship,
and the city Class A championship.
He was also runner-up in the Metro-

politan Club Class A championships
last year.

Several weeks ago he retained his
city championship crown when he de-
feated Dr. Dave O’Lough1in, Pitt ten-
nis coach, in the ﬁnals of the Pitts-
burgh Golf Club Squash Tournament.

Well-muscled, the nineteen-year-
old Panther looks the part of an ath-
lete, and he’s decidedly likeable.
Despite his national reputation, he
has the attribute of being completely
unassuming.

STARDOM PREDICTED

Billy modestly contends that he
plays a terrible game of golf and
tennis, but those who have played
tennis against him predict that he
will be one of the stars of the fresh-
man net team this spring.

He hails from Dormont High school,
and he worked for a year at a down-
town brokerage ofﬁce before enroll-
ing at Pitt. Possessed of a strong
competitive spirit and a ﬁne tourna-
ment temperament, Billy needs only
experience before taking his place
with the best squash players in the
world.

Panther Icers

Play F enn Six,
Near Playoffs

Beaten in the last two starts, the
Panther hockey brigade enters the
last week of the regular season with
nothing to gain and nothing to lose.

With the Duquesne Dukes already
in as city champions, the McSorley-
men will merely be going through
the motions in their last two games
with Fenn and Tech.

The Fenn sextet furnishes the so-
called opposition tomorrow night in
the opener of doubleheader in which
the Dukes play Tech in the second
game.

Pitt knocked off the Fenn team by
a 4-0 count earlier in the season at
Cleveland, and unless Fenn’s coach
pulls a ﬂashy wing or sharp shooting
center out of his hat tomorrow, at
very unlikely possibility, the Panth-
ers should win again by just about
the same score .as that of the ﬁrst
meeting.

Right now, all that really matters
is g8iT1iI'1g' revenge by beating Du-
quesne in the divisional playoffs. Pitt
took a more severe thumping from
the Dukes this year than from any
other league team, and only John
Carroll has a better average against
the Pitts than Duquesne since the
founding of theleague two years ago.

Despite -the record of three losses
and one win over the Dukes this
year, the Panthers are conﬁdent of
a victory in the playoffs. They base
their conﬁdence on the remarkable
series of bad breaks which plagued
them in Duquesne games during the
regular season.

The most important of these breaks
occurred last week when Pitt, obvi-
ously the superior team on that night,
lost a lead to the Dukes on a referee's
decision, than lost the game when
Coach McSorley took_his outﬁt off the
ice as a protest measure.

Should the playoffs be conducted
as they were last -year, there will be
a two-game series with the cham-
pionship being decided on a total
goal basis.

:PittPlayers Chalk Up Creditaiole

THE PITT NEVVS

Feriormances for éﬁrogther Rat’

By Dorothy Hughes

Pitt Players rolled their audiences
in the aisles last Thursday and Fri-
day with their hilarious production
of Monks and Finkelhoﬁ’s comedy of
Virginia Military institute life,
“Brother Rat.” From beginning to
end the entire cast cooperated in get-
ting across every laugh in the racy
play.

The performaces of Earl Riley as

Bing Edwards, the lovably simple 

cadet whose secret marriage and
prospective fatherhood provide‘ the
backbone of the plot, was outstand-
ing. ' . . 7‘
RECKLESS ROOMTVIATE
Clarence Shepard as Billy ‘Ran-
dolph, Bing’s well meaning_but-:reck-
less roommate, -_whose-- quixotic.» ef-

forts to aid Bing.and to enjoy life a_

bit at the same. time provide the p1ot.’s.
complications, was believable, ‘but as
a: boy with four years _of military
drill" in deportinent he left something
to be desired. V ,

John Fullerton as Dean Crawford,
the vehemently practical room-mate
to Bing and Billy, whose loyalty to
them draws him into their scrapes
against his better judgment, turned
in an adequate performance.
HEART-THROB

Gertrude Foreman as Joyce Win-
free, Billy’s heart-throb, was delight-
ful, both to the eye and to the ear,
although at times her interpretation
made Joyce a little to self-conscious-
ly affected.

Phyllis Post as Claire Ramm,
Joyce’s bespectacled roommate ‘and

daughter of Colonel Ramm, whose in- '

telligence and interest in men, de-
spite her adolescent inability to act
like a rational human being when
she is with them, bring her to the
barracks "at midnight to help Bing
with his chemistry, provided one of
the funniestscenes in the play. Like
Riley, she was consistent and in
character throughout the play.
STAGE TEARS

Ruth McGregor, as Mrs. Brooks,
J oyce’s charming grandmother, and
Virginia Hosp, as Jenny, the colored
maid, Were excellent. Dorothy Ann
Carrier, as Kate Rice Edwards, sec-
retly Bing’s wife, was not quite be-
lievable in telling Bing that she is to
have a baby. Miss Carrier does» not
seem to know that tears in real life
cannot be turned on and off like
water and that stage tears are much
improved by following the laws of
nature. The rest of her scene, how-
ever, was sincere.

William Patrick as “Mistol” Bot-
tome, the freshman “rat” who must
obey the harsh biddings of the sen-

Will Tap New Men
At Military Formal

Tapping of new men to mem-
bership in Scabbard and Blade,
national honorary‘ military frater-
nity, will take place at the Military
Ball, March 24, at Hotel William
Penn, according to J. Alfred Ber-
gér, iM39, chairman of the dance
and _ﬁrst lieutenant of the frater-
nity. ,, _

,This year is,-the first time that
the student body‘may witness the
tapping ceremonies at the Univer-
sity. Tapping has always taken
place at the closed dance in Feb-
r'uary,' but this year the Scabbard
and? Blade dance is ‘being com-"
bined with the Military Ball. ’

About 10 men of the advanced
ROTC corps will be tapped. Edwin

.Ellis, C39, ﬁrst.sergeant of Scab-

bard and Blade. is in charge of the
tapping ceremony. Final tapping
for the year will be held during
Spring Festival week.

Only forewarning came from a
downtown newspaper. The songs
were all broadcast over the Mutual
network on the Musical Steelmakers’
broadcast yesterday afternoon. ’

“We hope to hear these songs all
over the country,” Biddle stated, as
he announced plans to make the
songs availaable to Pittsburgh bands
and the records available in places
catering to the students.

Several Pittsburgh orchestras, in-
cluding Bernie Cummins, Al Young,
and Lenny Hahn, are already playing
“Diary of Dreams” regularly.

Military Ball committeemen have
announced that Kay Kyser will play
the Cap and Gown songs at the Mili-
tary Ball and possibly broadcast them
from the ball.

James Lindsay and his stage crew

American Hiistorical Association
Refuses to Convene in Pittsburgh

Because the University had" been
censured by the American Associa-
tion of University-Professor_s for “vio-
lation of the principles of academic
freedom,” the .American Historical
Association has declined the invita-
tion of Mayor Cornelius‘ D: Scully to
meet in Pittsburgh in 1940. '_ p '

The decision and thereason for the
decision were -made known to ‘the
Mayor in a letter from Conyers Read,
professor of history at the ,University

of Pennsylvania and executive secre-_

tary of the association. _’

The place of meeting of the annual
convention is always decided by the
Association at its annual business
meeting, but the Council of the asso-
ciation recommended that’ the.Execu-
tive Committee be authorized to pick
the place of meeting for the 1940 con-_
vention. "

Mr. Read’s explanation follows:

“The matter came up for de-
cision at the meeting of the Exec-
utive Committee on March 5. In
presenting the question "for con-
sideration, the Executive Secretary
called attention to the fact that he
had received a large number of let-
ters protesting against the selection
of Pittsburgh as a place of meet-
ing on the grounds that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburghhad been" cen-
sured by the American Association
of University professors for viola-
tion of the principles. of academic
freedom.

“These letters came from some
of the outstanding members of the
profession and in six cases were
joint letters signed by the entire
history faculties of large universi-
ties. Under these circumstances,
the Executive Committee decided
to decline the invitation» to meet in
Pittsburgh.”

Mayor Scully received Mr. Read’s
letter in his capacity as chairman of
the Pittsburgh Convention and Tour-
ist Bureau.

Homer

Wadsworth, secretary to

that Satisiics with a Capital 

* Radio City’s World-famous “Rockettes’,’ and CHESTERFIELDS

Mayor Scully, when releasing Mr.
Read’s letter, said, “This ilustrates

one of the reasons why conventions
don’t come to Pittsburgh.”

When informed of the decision of

-the Executive Committee, Dr. John

D. Oliver, professor and head of the
department of history, stated that he
was glad that the invitation was re-
fused. He said that the worry and
expense of a convention of this type
are very great.

Dr. Alfred P. James, professor of
history, stated that the hotel situa-
tion in Pittsburgh was bothering the
convention at their last meeting when
the decision to refer the matter to the
Executive Committee was made.

Arther to Address PBI
On ‘Advertising Today’

“Advertising of Today” will be the
topic of an address by William C.
Arther, instructor in commerce and
operator of a Pittsburgh advertising
agency, at the PBI luncheon tomor-
row at 12:30 o’clock at the Y club
rooms, Forbes and Bouquet streets.

Continuance of the series of lunch-
eons will depend on the turnout at
tomorrow’s meeting. Tickets, priced
at 35 cents, can be obtained from
members of PBI, at YMCA ofﬁces,
