Calendar Committee Puts Rules in Writing

University—Wide Events Defined

Student Government President John Vrana has drafted a written ‘set’ of operating
rules for the Student Government Calendar Committee. The Student Affairs Commit-
tee approved‘ the outline Tuesday which has been used in practice since summer to

eliminate any conflict between University-wide events.

The Calendar Committee is responsible for granting approval for sponsorship of
University-wide social events for an inclusive student social calendar and for helping

student organizations plan their own individual calendars.

Vrana chairs the group made up of the seven vice-presidents sitting on the SG
senate——Associated Women Students, Interfraternity Council, Men’s Council, Men’s
Dormitory Council, Panhellenic Council, Student Union Board, and Women’s Hous-

ing Board.

wide event as one that is open

to the entire student body. It
should be sponsored by one of
the seven organizations previous-
ly mentioned which function for
the total student body, with
other student organizations and
dormitory living units sponsor-
ing programs for their own mem-
bers and guests.

Any university-wide events
involved with fund-raising or
charity must be specially ap-
proved by the Dean of Students
and the Committee as well as
any events sponsored by re-
ligious groups. Any execptions
must go through the same chan-
nels.

. Mortar Board and Cwens agreed
to forgo their appropriations in
line with the Committee’s sug-
gestion that no honorary group
come under the Student Affairs
budget. Dr. Rankin suggested di-
viding the $350 into a $250 addi-
tion to Ideas and Figures literary
magazine and $100 to the Men’s
Glee Club, which the Committee
had numbered one and two re-
spectively in priority for any
additional appropriations.

HANDBOOK

A representative of every
student organization may pick
up a copy of the new Student
Handbook at the Student Union
Desk, beginning Monday.

Results of the latest Pitt News
random poll show that Univer-
sity students still overwhelming-
ly favor Lyndon Johnson for pres-
ident.

.However, Senator Barry Gold-
water has chipped away at a ma-
jority which showed 85 per cent
pro Johnson in mid summer to a
76 per cent majority favoring
Johnson this week.

Sour Sixties Theme,
Fighting Irish, Set
For Homecoming

By NANCY FUCHS

With the “Sour Sixties” as the theme and the “Fight-
ing Irish” on the ﬁeld, Homecoming has been set for the
weekend of November 6-7. A concert, dance, and the foot-
ball game with Notre Dame w-ill highliglii-,._the weekend.

A parade of floats,-V queen contestants, and the Uni-
versity band will usher in the weekend festivities. After
a football game between the top two fraternity teams in
the intramural leagues A and B, a pep rally will be staged
on the Cathedral lawn.

The concert at Carnegie Music Hall Friday night will

feature a three part show of varied entertainment: Come-
dia:1 Jackie Vernon, recording star Bobby Vmton, and folksmgers,

the Mandrell Singers. Three fraternities, as yet unamed, will hold
open houses and provide music and entertaimnent after the concert.
Dormitories Open
All men’s and women’s dormitories will open their doors to vis-
itors at 11:30 a.m. Saturday morning, the half-time ceremonies at
the afternoon game will be televised nationally.

Saturday night's traditional Homecoming Dance will be held
at Webster Hall Hotel as it was last year. The Homecoming com-
mittee, however, has rented two ballroms, doubling the available
space last year. Don Wade’s Orchestra which played for IG Ball_
and Greek Week in the past, will entertain in the downstairs ball-
room, «and a combo called “The Pharoahs" will perform upstairs.

“In an attempt to solve the problems of money, time, size, and
irate neighbors, enumerated by Interfraternity Council last year, we
have decided to make smaller ﬂoats this year,” explained James
Smith and Joni Geltzeiler, Homecoming chairmen. “The cost,. size, and
hours spent on the ﬂoat will be cut in half,” Smith continued.

Homecoming Floats

The ﬂoats will be buit on heavy-duty, ﬂat-bed stake trucks, and
the $200 limit of cost is reduced to $100. Live ﬁgures, limited to ﬁve,
will dominate the ﬂoat, with the emphasis placed on originality of

, costumes and beauty. The theme of “Sour Sixties” implies a “satire

of events which have taken place in the 1960’s and which may occur
before the end of the decade,” according to Miss Geltzeiler.
Major construction on the truck is limited to the time be-
tween noon November 3 to noon November 6.

pennies.
“Panties from Heaven”

Another fellow commented on “black pants

girl told her friends, “They’re going crazy! I just
threw out my best slip.”

Meanwhile the senior assistants yelled,

“Screens down!” and “Girls! Girls, time to get

to bed.” Mrs. John Dierst, housemother of H01-
land Hall, is rumored to have gone out into the
Quad and counted windows, but when asked
she replied “no comment.” Mrs. James Buch-
holz, housemother of Brackenridge, remained
inside and directed the senior assistants to keep
the girls from the, windows. (Mrs. Buchholz
doesn’t know of any girls in her dorm who
have been campused.

Bender, assistant director of men’s housing, and

the scene. But,,at 12:30 the wide-awake fellows and
girls stirred up the Quad again. The campus po-
licemen apparently quieted them. However, the
fellows soon started to chant “We want silk” while
ﬂashes and ﬂags appeared -at the dorm windows.

The excitement died down and ﬁnally faded

Raise Up Your Voices
We Can Overcome

, By Nancy Delaney
For a few minutes, Tuesday night, I thought this
school was finally going to turn into a college.
‘ But when all the students fluifed up their foam rub-

. I ,_ber pilows and slipped between their sterile white sheets;
‘ .and Wednesday was just another gray morning with cold

eggs for breakfast. _ ' _
‘ .It takes more than a few songs exchanged between
women" in the dorms and mengathered in the quad to
mold a school complex into a college
community; it takes. more than a
few strains of “Hail to Pitt” shouted
in a sudden burst of spirit to cre-
ate a feeling of school unity; and it
even takes more than ,a red silk slip
tossed out a window into a scrim-
mage of men beneath to distinguish
a _vital student body from a middle-
aged board of trustees. But these
could be a start.

Not that I specifically advocate
  _  ..  .. panty raids,

MISS DELANEY It’s just that I advocate living.

-, AND TO ME, twenty-year-old students whoalready

‘accept “what can’t be changed,” are not living Twenty-

year-old students who don’t even scream out-—let alone

I‘ ‘ fight back—at frustrations, might as well go home at

night to a suburban “crackerbox” surrounded by a white
picket fence, rather than to a college dormitory. Twenty-

. year-old students who don’t get excited about anything,

are already enshrouded. _

Tuesday night the girls sang “We Shall Overcome”
when University police tried to break up the festivities.
And overcome they did——for a while. Why not continue
to overcome? Overcome “the‘approved,” “the accepted,”

 _ “the unchangeable.” Why not care enough to oppose what
’ stands in the way? It’s the privilege—no, the distinguish-

ing mark—-of the college student to oppose. . ‘

If twenty-year-old college students are too passive
to care about discrimination, too dull to examine election
issues, too tired to picket against Goldwater, and toogworn
out to plan panty raids, they are not students — they are
merely involved in job-training programs.

Education should breed protest. V

THREATS 0F punititive action may dissuade full-
fledged panty raids, but they should not curtail efforts

A.  at honest-to-goodness constructive action. If the adminis-
tration refuses to cooperate, throw red slips and chant
2 _ “We Shall Overcome,” If the distribution courses restrict

‘creativity, refuse to. “pull down the shades.” And if the
University offers the second best, demand “We want silk.”

Wednesday morning dawned gray and cold — but
next Wednesday needn’t, nor Thursday, nor Friday. Rais-
ed voices are always loudest “In the Still of the Night.”

   Editorial: nevelopmentalnute   

A Student business managers will look woefully at their appropriati'ons from the
Student Affairs Office this year and with ‘good reason. The ceiling on this budget
hasn't had a significant rise in 10 years.

There is certainly no doubt as to the need for more funds in this area; not only
are operating expenses keeping pace with a soaring national economy but the organ-
izations themselves must continually expand to satisfy a growing, more concerned

student body.

The blame does not rest in the Student Affairs area. This office, like every
other, is given a ceiling figure, and if thisamount doesn't increase, any requests from
student organizations are automatically stalemated at this point. The physical plant
and educational resources must be the ﬁnancial focus now, the students are told. “The
development of the student as a whole person” is not yet ﬁnancially feasible.

So the students have moved out on their own steam. WPGH, desperately in
need of about $3000 to get their organization in full operation, has taken over the U
niversity blotter, formerly handled by private students, with the hopes of meeting
about one-third of their projected goal. Ideas and Figures, similarly, is co-sponsoring
a movie with the Student Union Board to raise funds.

These are only two student operations, both ‘ of which need their membership
to spend time on their product, which have been forced to scramble for additional
money. And in a recent statement concerning the all-University social calendar, any
such event designed for fund-raising must meet special approval of the Calendar
Committee and the Dean of Students.

The students are interested in raising the money, not just in demanding the
administration for it. If we have been presented with an accurate picture of the Uni-
versi‘ty’s ﬁnancial status, screams would only fall on deaf ears. The only way out
at this point may be a student activities fee in addition to the regular Student Af-
fairs appropriations, perhaps with the University matching a certain percentage of
what the student body is willing to contribute. '

A ten dollar fee would mean $120,000 extra in funds to be distributed among
student organizations by the students themselves. The benefits from such a fee, not
to mention the necessity, should be seriously considered if “student development” is

to succeed.

Letters to the Editor  

Cross — Country
Coverage Blasted

By Irate Student

Editor, The Pitt News:

I’ should be accustomed to a
futile situation after more than
three years but, forgive me, I
am not. I'm quite certain that it

is going to come as a prodigious ‘

shock to The Pitt News sports

"staff, but there really are some

individuals who are knowledge-
able fans of the sports of cross-
country and track and ﬁeld
(when in season).

A A I certainly don’t expect any de-

tailed, ,“in-depth” reports be-
cause that requires an iota of
knowledge of the sport. Three
years have been more than enough
time to realize that this kind of
knowledge among the sports staff
is about as abundant as the
pterodactyl. -

I could state a countless num-
ber of examples of inefficient and
blatantly ignorant reporting of
the activities of these two teams,
but that would merely be criti-

lcism of a destructive nature.

Making excuses for a lost» foot-
ball game is very ﬁne and we all
know that football pays the way
for the smaller sports.

I don’t even mind the superior
coverage given to the other var-
sity sports. But when intramural
activities are given three times
the coverage of the only victori-
ous varsityteazn for the weekend,
and an upset victory at that. then
I can only conclude that the
sports page is composed" by a
number of very feeble brain cells
And, gentlemen, the sports page
of Monday, Sept. 28, is typical
and in no way an exception.

But this letter was not written
merely as criticism. I would ask,
on behalf of these sports, that'
even if there is no knowledge, let

Readers Dispute
Concert Review
By ‘News’ Writer
Editor, The Pitt News: ‘

I_ wish to congratulate Mr.
Barryishaw for the rare talent

be displayed in his review of

the Dubow concert.

Being a music lover myself, I
was naturally slow to perceive
the vritty ﬁnesse with which he
tricks the reader to approach his
article in a serious manner, tak-
ing it merely at face value, until
it gradually dawns on him that
border on the_mephistophe1ian,
only a mind whose satiric talents
could have concoted such grotes-
que distortions as the ones‘ to
be found here.

From this new view point his
verbal carricatures assume a
new dimension in the ﬁeld of
critical writing. When the young
lady performer astonishes him
by her talent to follow her ac-
companist “immediately” and “as
expected” and even played either
tenderly or powerfully “where
the music calls for it” (and all
this so “exceedingly wel1”!), then
I can only admit that the author
is in possession of “extreme in-
sight” but not, unfortunately, of
any knowledge of the matter in-
volved. Although the keen eye
for the lady's “ﬂowing body”
(with the charms of Debussy . . .
whatever that means), bespeaks

   

which the bemused reader,appre-
ciates. I certainly cannot “fail to
be impressed” by Mr. Shaw's (but
not Miss Dubow’s!) “assuming
manner”

Could it be that his perfor-
mance “on the Dubow” was done
exceedingly well than hers “on”
Beethoven? For the funniest
story of the year. I recommend
the author for a lifelong honorary
membership in “Mad Magazine”
with one suggestion: Would the
reporter try next time to attend
the concert so that he could at
least mention the titles of the
performed works?

Foreign  Policies      

Highlight Debate

. By SANDY FOX

Student debate about the 1964 election issues, spon-
sored Tuesday afternoon by the Student Union Board,
centered around the question of whether the United States
should restrain its use of force or should deliberately
demonstrate its power in dealing Wlthl other nations.

Richard Bishirjian, state chairman of Youth for Goldwater-
Miller, advocated the latter position on behalf 9f the Republican
candidates; Don Kelly, vice-chairman of the Allegheny County
Young Citizens for Johnson, opposed him.

Bishirjian based his argument on a statement by Hans Morgen-
thau that all political phenomena follow three patterns: to keep
power, to increase power, or to demonstrate power. Johnson he said,
seeks to maintain the status quo, to merely keep power, whereas
Goldwater advocates a show of prestige or a demonstration of power.

Five Johnson Goals Cited

Kelly answered by citing the ﬁve key goals of the Kennedy-

Johnson administration in foreign affairs: to negotiate with other

DON KELLEY, liberal, and Dick ' Bishirijian, conservative, express
their political views in a debate at the Student Union on Tuesday.
By a coincidence in appearances, it seems their political consciences
are misplaced. Goldwater vs. Kennedy, anyone? -

nations, to form and strengthen progress alliances, to support arms
control, to maintain an “area of containment” in Viet Nam, and to
continue in a reapprochement with the Soviet Union.
Reapprochment  not enough, Bishirjian prdtested, “We '
must go forward against an enemy which seeks to increase power
. . . only through strength and a willingness to use it will we
be able "to recapture -the initiative in foreign affairs.”

Kelly, on the other hand, praised J ohnson’s attitude of restraint
in the use of force and his “willingness to be very careful” in deal-
ing with problems .arising in Southeast Asia. Goldwater's foreign
policy, he remarked, consists of “total victory” and “brinkmanship.”

_ Domestic Policies Discussed

On domestic‘ policies, Bishirjian again accused Johnson of act-
ing as the circumstances dictate and of maintaining the status quo.
Kelly countered by calling Goldwater’s attitude on domestic affairs,
.a “do-it-yourself” society; Johnson, instead, pursues the “the great
society.”

_ Responding to a question from Kelly, Bishirjian explained that,
philosophically, nothing connects Goldwater with the John Birch
ociety. - - ' '

In reply to an equally embarassing question, Kelly admitted

stalls parking meters in the area
between Forbes Field and Car-

Men’s Dorm Council opened its first
fall meeting Wednesday night with dis-
cussions ranging from Tuesday’s Quad-

frangle “disturbances” to administration

disapproval of house names. Included was
a unanimous resolution passed in support
of Student Government's drive for dis-
counts at the University Book Center.
John Bender, assistant director of

‘ men’s housing, warned the council_ repre-

sentatives that the near “panty raid” erup-
tion on Tuesday night could have-resulted
in expulsion from the University. He urged MDC
to pass the word that similar outbursts at the
University would not be tolerated.

A President Harvey Lefton told council that the
women’s and men’s dormitories will now be in-
cluded in the spirit award contest and asked

~_that all houses to enter the competition.

He then read’? proposed amendment to the
constitution that houses must get both SG and
calendar committee and dean of students approval
to sanction MDC programs. The amendment grew
out of a University-wide ﬁlm series planned by
one house which was unofficially cancelled by the

‘ calendar committee. Said Lefton, “No house can

‘program for the entire University.” To prevent
outsiders from infringing, Lefton suggested only

three or four tickets per member be sold for MDC‘

events.
Dorms Add Signatures
Vice-president Jim Neubeck estimated that the
dorms added about 900 to 1,000 signatures to the
2,300 collected by SG in the petition drive for a
student discount in the Book Store.
— In other business, MDC assessed the income
from the dry cleaning in the basement at about
$50 per month. Lefton pointed out that MDC’s
the only self-sufficient body on campus.

Council adopted a resolution made by Larry ’

    

 Activities: -  
Improvements at Opening

Kiel that dress for senators be left to the dj,§;;re—
tion of the individual, and then followed with a
dress-up day suggestion at which formal attire
for cafeteria dining was discussed.
Change in Names

A change in house names and addition of for-
merly unnamed houses was considered at the
prompting of administration disapproval of pres-
ent house names. Objection was raised to two of
the houses names, Playboys’ Penthouse and Uncle
Tom’s Cabin.” Lefton made it clear that the choice
of names is up to the individual houses when
many senators raised the fear that the trustees
might decide the name for the houses.

Homecoming, it was decided, will cater this .
year more to the dorm dweller than in previous
years. This year the activities will be conﬁned
to Carnegie Music Hall, Webster Hall Hotel,
and the Tower lobbies. Homecoming tickets will
be sold at a discount to dorm students.

Placement of additional phones in the Towers
brought the narrow defeat of one resolution and
the passage of another. The ﬁrst resolution asked
Bell Telephone to install pay telephones on .all
floors of the Towers. ‘ '

Resolution Criticized
The resolution was criticized by Bender who
said that he and the counselors were against it
because of late calls and noise. A sound resolution
calling for more phones in the lobby was passed.

Cultural Chairman v Bob Boylan announced
tentative plans for a discussion between the
N.A.A.C.P. and the National Association for the
Advancement of White People, sometime before
the election. .

In another committee report, Peter Baer, so-
cial chairman, explained that in" addition to the
regularly scheduled MDC dances, council was con-
sidering a “Thank God It’s Friday” dance series
in the Tower lobby.

. Review:   I €99 F Parody
by Dr. Richard Tobias -
(Dr. Tobias is a member of the English Department faculty.)

Two separate issues of the autumn
 number of Ideas and Figures circulate on
on campus: one is the regular publication,
 with a lush cover and excellent printng,
and the other is a mimeographed parody.
I It might help if the parody issue had been
called Dimwits and Scribbles to distin-
. guish the real from the fake and make my
- job easier. William Bennett is chiefly re-
0 sponsible for theparody but other ex-staff
workers on Ideas and Figures have con-

 

cise. The joke is very rococo (it may take
an hour of study), but the joke is worth
the price of the parody issue. '

The parody ridicules the faults and
extravagances of the original much more
thoroughly than I can here. Bennett is
no longer on campus and he is, therefore,
safe. The parody also praises the maga-
zine. It takes courage and energy to pub-
lish a story just as it takes courage and
energy to go on stage, to go to Mississippi,
or play football. As the football player

Opens with Pep Rally

The Student Government will kick-off its annual
spirit drive with the pep rally at 6:30 this evening on the
Student Union lawn. An award is given to a group in
each category that shows the most spirit at all of the
major events of the school year.

Four categories of organizations will compete for the coveted
awards. Fraternities, sororities, housing units, and all other activities
comprise the four divisions which will compete for the prize in their
respective category.

Division prizes will be based on a show of spirit at varsity games,

The regular Ideas and Figures, under

Sorority Life simwn

   

By Panhel at Review
Monday In Ballroom

Informal sorority rush for freshmen and transfer
women begins Monday with the Panhellenic Preview
scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Student Union Ballroom.

The purpose of the evening is to introduce the fresh-
men and transfer women to sorority life, according to
Beverly Lichter, Panhel president. Three members from

each sorority will stage a skit entitled “Panhel Preview --

Presents.” All sorority members will join in the singing
of the first and last songs of the skit.

Following the program, each sorority will have a
table set up in the S.U. Lower Lounge displaying its

sorority magazine, sorority jew-

elry, and a card which displays
the sorority name, its Greek let-
ters, its ﬂower, and colors. Sor-
ority members will be in the
Lower Lounge following the pro-
gram to greet the new students
during the get-acquainted hour,
according to Miss Lichter.

Receives Handbook

Each rushee attending the Pre-
view will receive a copy of the
Panhel rush ‘booklet which in-
cludes a statement by Helen Pool
Rush, dean of women, a statement
by Miss Lichter, a short sketch
about the. sororities, and a list
of the rush rules.

“It is as much the responsi-
bility of the freshmen; and
transfers to understand the
rules as it is the responsibility
for the sorority members to
know them,” Miss Lichter said.

Tuesday, Panhel will hold sor-
ority education meetings at noon
in 1228 CL andat 7 p.m. in the
SU Ballroom. “This is to bene-
ﬁt the commuter as well as the
dorm student,” she explained.

LONG SHADOWS

AHLTHHOUGH KENNY

LUCAS plays second string
quarterback, he plays in the
shadow of two great roll-
out quarterbacks. Lucas will
always pay in the shadow
of his brother, Richie, an

a few years ago. But this
i's the last year Kenny will
play in the shadow of all-
America candidate Fred
Mazurek.

In the Oregon game, Ma-
-zurek’s shadow was so long,
228 yards long, in fact, that
it almost— entirely blotted
out the junior quarterback.
Lucas got into the game for

with four seconds left to
play in the first half. Lu-
cas threw one pass. It was

Lucas’s backfield coach,
Bimbo Cecconi‘, explained
why Lucas did not play
more in the game. “Freddy
was hot,” Cecconi explain-
ed. “And as long as he was
hot, we figured it was best
to stay with him. It makes
no sense to take a player
out when he is having so
much success.”

ONORMALLY, CECCONI
terbacks, and feels lucky

are very fortunate to have
two good quarterbacks,”
Cecconi said. “Look what happens to some other teams,
teams that have only one quarterback.

“Take Navy,” Cecconi continued. ‘‘All they have is
Roger Staubach. Without him, they had trouble beating

 ~ . William & Mary.” *

Without Staubach at quarterback, Navy led the In-

it ' dians by only 14-6, into the fourth quarter. Staubach then

came into the game. and sparked the Midshipmen to a

played, Navy might not have won.

With this kind of realization in mind, Cecconi feels
he has to keep his second unit quarterback ready for ac-
tion, and the only way a quarterback can be ready, ac-
cording to Cecconi, is to play.

“Normally,-” Cecconi said, “I like to get Kenny in

‘there.’ But against Oregon there was. just no reason to

take Freddy out. Freddy was in great condition. He had
good momentum, he didn’t fumble, and he didn ’t get
hurt.” '

But even if Mazurek did get hurt, the Panthers would
notbe without a competent quarterback. “Kenny is one
hundred per cent competent,” Cecconisaid. “He has the
desire to play, and he works hard.”

BUT MORE IMPORTANT, the quarterback with

A hair that looks like it’s just received an electric shock

believes he can doithe job. “He’s not satisﬁed with sitting
on the bench,” Cecconi said. Lucas came here to play, not
to watch the game from the 50-yard line. “Every time
the whistle blows he’s up getting ready to go into the
game.”

But Lucas still wanted to play against Oregon. “I

our schedule, and that every game wouldn’t be like Ore-

Sets to throw a pass

1.... .. RM...  
Hindering Panthers  

By FRANK SMIZIK

How much has the doing away
with red-shirting hurt the Pitt
football team this fall’? Guard
Josh Novogratz feels that the
lack of red—shirted players on the
Panther squad is one of their
main problems.

“Last year we had guys like
Borghetti, Maczuzak, and Ware
who were ﬁve year men and who
had the extra year of experience
which I think was the big factor
in their’s and the team’s suc-
cess.”

Lack of these men is one prob-
lem, but out on the field the team
doesn’t seem to be playing to-
gether under a team leader. They
march up and down the ﬁeld but
can’t get a sustained ‘touchdown
drive. Novogratz, however, says
a team leader isn’t the reason
for the lack of scoring.

“Ray Popp is a good team
leader and I think he has done
a great job. Wel had »a good
game against Oregon and I
think we played together as a
team pretty well, but the rea-
son we possibly don’t look that
impressive is because we keep
making mistakes, either men-
tal or physica .”

The mistakes cost the Panthers
two games so far, and Novogratz
feels that the Panthers were the
better team in both games. “I
think we were better than both
teams, however, I think Oregon
played a better game against us.”

Josh (he doesn’t like to be
called Joe, which incidentally the
coaches started calling him) plays
guard and middle linebacker.
The same position his All-Amer-

ican brother Bob played in, his _

stay at West Point.

JOSH NOVOGRATZ
Almost a Cadet

“I could have gone to West
Point also, but I wanted a lib-
eral arts school because I have
intentions of going to law
school. I don’t particularly care

for the Army life either.”

Bob was an All-America at .
Army in 1958. Josh, however;

was recruited by Frank Lauter-
ber who had just left West Point
to come to Pitt. Novogratz is

now here, while Pitt lost Lauter- '

ber to Toledo.
Convincing Novogratz was a

signiﬁcant contribution to the \

Panther line. Josh is second
string but isn’t a. poor second.
He plays a position where Pitt
is strong with good men. He
also feels he is improving with
every game.
“I like to play defense a little
better, although it is much more
difficult to play. My offensive

play is my strong point, however,"

experience will improve my de-«.
fensive play.”

Ohio University tomorrow at 10
a.m. at Forbes Field. Thebooters
lost to West Chester. 3-2, last

“They’ve got somewhat the

“They’ve got some veterans,
but they started nine sophomores
against us last week. They played

Lynn Doherty.

Coach Leo Bemis said, "‘I ex-

from the West Chester loss,
and have a. convincing win. We
still have an opportunity for a
good season, and we’ll have to
play Howard and Penn State
before we get a chance to go
to the NCAA playoffs.” A
Although Bemis is undecided
about the starting lineup, it will
probably be similar to the West
Chester game. Ken Lang will be
the probable starter at -goalie,
and Dom Millilio will see some
action: if the booters dominate
play.
Andy McGraw, Jim Cuddy,
and Cal Bonawitz will be the
fullbacks, as they were in the

West Chester‘ and Frostburg
games. George Shimpino will
start at center-forward.

After the West Chester game,
Bemis said, “Our linemen and
halfbacks were a little weak to-
wards the end.” Facing . a fast
team_again this week, Bemis will
be alternating Vince Bartalotta
and Sal Tavares with Joe Meyers

.-and Sam‘Donatel1i at the inside -

positions. George Sommer will
play right halfback while Jim
Snyder and Al Traunsteiner will
be available at left halfback.

Dave Reichenbach and Aldo
Zortea will remain the starting
wings.

Two of the highest scoring
games of intramural softball play
were turned in by Fraternity
League “B” last week, Phi Gam-
ma Delta crushed Phi Kappa
Theta, 20-13; and Zeta Beta Tau

= collapsed under the onslaught of

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 19-13.

Dennie Miller aided his own
cause by hitting a home run in
gaining his second victory of the
campaign. Bill Baloh hit his third
home run in two games for the
FiJi’s. Although the Fi Kap’s out-
hit the FiJi’s 18 to 14, they
couldn’t hold back their time-
ly outbursts. Whittman was the
losing pitcher.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon downed
Zeta Beta Tau behind Ken Fred-
rick‘s two home runs. Winning
pitcher Karl Quinn allowed 13
hits, one a home run to Paul
Ash, his fourth of the tourna-
ment. Dave Kantor also connect-

Pi Kappa Alpha (1-0) play for A

one of the ﬁnalist spots today
while Phi Kappa Theta (0-1)
challenges Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(1-1) in another ~elimination
game.

Uncle Tom’s Cabin and Play-
boy’s Penthouse played in an
all day rain and on slippery
grass before the former won
out, 14-8. Dino Boni was his
third game without defeat al-
though he gave up 22 hits. The
Cabin had 11 hits, one of them
a home run by Bob Codey.
Uncle Tom now moves into
position for the champion’s
laurels. Playboys are eager for
another crack at the Cabin but
must ﬁrst play Random. Both
carry 3-1 records into the con-
test. The Penthouse beat Ran-

Adom, 15-7, earlier in the sea-
son.‘

Other games in _the Dorm
League last week found victories
for the before mentioned teams.

the hands of the Playboys, 12-4.
Lydick earned the victory as Kap-
lan suffered the loss. There were
only two home runs in the game;
Grunner for “B” and Nicholas
for PP. The Playboys h.ad aver-
aged 14 runs and 18 hits per
game before losing to Uncle Tom.

Home runs by Bill Jerome and

to the boys from Uncle Tom’s

Harriers Combine
Drive, Desire, Guts

The cross-country team, in the midst of one of its
most active successful seasons, can point to a rare com-
bination of personal interest, desire and guts for its win-

ning efforts. _

Spearheading its wins over Slippery Rock, 15-50, and

Ohio University and Kent State,
31-35-64, were senior John Bailey,
junior Damien Koch, and sopho-
mores Larry Hubner, Frank Han-
dleman, and Fran Shor.

In his ﬁrst year as coach of
the harriers, Jim Banner had
little to look back to in last
year's mediocre 3-4 squad. “It’s
the boys who have done it,”
said Banner. “They’ve been
running harder and have been
mentally prepared.”

“In our last two meets there
have been less than 30 second
separating the top ﬁve runners,"
continued Banner. “That's the
real reason for their success.
They run so well together and
don't really care who ﬁnishes ﬁrst
as long as they win.”

John Bailey, double-letterman
and team captain, ‘has been term-
ed by Banner as having the in-
gredients of a real distance run-

ner. “John’s been a great cap-
tain,” said Banner. “He has done
a lot to help these boys out. Also,
he has that intense interest to‘
be better than average.”

Damien Koch, the Panthers’

top harrier at Kent, is the only -

member of the squad not on a
scholarship. According to Banner,
the just loves to run. »

X-y is the winning formula that the Panthers are

‘looking for in tomorrow’s game with William and Mary

at Pitt Stadium. X represents a sound pass defense which

V the Panthers must work on and Y is the number of mis-
1 takes the team makes on offense and defense.

‘Twice Bob Berry got around the Panther pass de-

passes. The only mistakes

Weren’t conﬁned to the pass defenders as inexperience
has been taking it’s toll on the Panther squad.

The offensive mistakes were made by Dale Stewart
last week as he fumbled‘ twice and dropped a pass. Also,
mistakes such as roughing the kicker and going ofl'si'des

; 6 resulted in costly penalties for

I 1 the Panthers.
A i W & M Has Problems

William and Mary has prob-

' - lems of their own as they also

are trying to get a formula for

winning after losing 35-6 last
'week to Navy.

The 'Indians played a fine

_ game until the fourth quarter
I ' . and were only losing 14-6. Then
Roger Staubach came 01! the
bench and led Navy to a 21

~ -point fourth quarter.

, ‘Coach Marv Levy’s squad seems
- to lack depth, problem they have
in common with the Panthers.
The weakest spot on the team
seems to be at tackles where only
one man with any varsity ex-
perience is back. Only three tac-
kles are said to be of ﬁrst or
second team quality. Jeﬁf Craig,
Joe Neilson, and Lan'y Harrell.

Inexperienced Line

The rest of the line for the
Indiansfaces the same problem.
I 3 There is no one to back up the
ﬁrst string line. The ends seem

 

  
 
  
    
  
   
   
   
 

to have the most depth with
three proven performers and two
promising sophomores.

The halfbaoks are well rep-
resented, especially with the
presence of Captain Scott Swan
one ‘of the best all around play-

_ ers on the squad. He isn’t very
big «at 5’11"‘ and 180 pounds
but the William and Mary bro-
chure lists him as a “constant

e hustler and a most aggressive
ball player.”

Fullback shows Sam Miller and
converted end Harold Rausch
battling for top position. The
key, however, to the Indian of-

fense is quarterback Dennis Hag~ .

lan.

He is the Fred Mazurek type
of quarterback who loves to roll
out although he is not an effec-
tive passer. If Haglan plays most
of the game the Indians will be
a running club, however, Jack
Becker, a sophomore, may see a
lot of action due to his passing
ability. -
