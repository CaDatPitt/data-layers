Election Developments!

 

To “insure as clean and straight election as possible” Student
Council acted at its meeting Wednesday night to guard against irreg-
ularities and prevent fraudulent voting and vote solicitation by choos-
ing ballot-box watchers from the “supposedly so-called coalition, the
n_on-coalition group and neutral students” groups.

For the first time in years c
on the campus today as the heav
both Independent and “Coalition"

irculars and propaganda appeared
iest student vote was predicted by
observers.

Registration cards will be required of all voters, which will be
crayoned after balloting to prevent any “double” voting.
Votes, for the first time, will be publicly counted at the close of

today's balloting under the direction of the Election committee of
Student Council in the presence of Walter J. Rome, assistant dean

of men, in room 2, State Hall, this

While prepaiations were going on
yesterday to assure an honest elec-
tion, campaigners for the _,various
candidates issued statements in which
they expressed conﬁdence in the ulti-
mate results. For the first time in
years circulars and DI‘0DagaD_d3- We-T9
issued in the interest of candidates.

In the College, supporters of Jules
Green pointed out that his coalition
support assured him of a headstart of
from 60 to 80 votes over Irving D.
Robbins. Supporters of Robbins on
the other hand looked for a heavy
vote to react favorably f0!’ him. They
pointed out that there are 1500
eligible voters in the College, many
of whom will vote for the ﬁrst time
because of Robbins’ announced pro-
gressive D1at’I'0I_‘ID.

Senior Fight Tri-Cornered

The ﬁght for the senior represen-
tative's job in the College seems to
lie among Howard A. Cohen, an incle-
pendent; Ralph Edward KYDer, sup-
ported by an anti-coalition ticket, and
James Danahey. Cohen claims to
have more than 150 votes deﬁnitely
promised; Kyper has been promised
support from several fratern1ties_ ‘not
included in the six fraternity coalition,
but many consider Danahey, the
coalition candidate, to. have the in-
side track. Januska IS said to be
handicapped because of the late_ date
on which he announced his candidacy.
He may, however, draw votes away.
from Cohen. _

'1‘he ﬁght between Pannier and
Turner in the Engineering school
should be very tight’ with partisan
lines closely drawn.‘ l.‘hei'e.wil1 be
no election for a senior candidate.

Fraternities Divide Vote

Paul M. Baker and George Golanty
are expected to divide much of Xide
fraternity vote in the Bus1.ness_ -
ministration elections for JIIIIIOI‘ repre-
sentative with George I. Williamson
as a significant dark horse. Tbléll
senior job in the Bus. Ad. school will
probably be the-closest ﬁght 01’. at
with ﬁve candidates in the running.

The usual ﬁght between Psi Omega
and Delta Sigma Delta will take place
in the Dental school. Derr and Refine
are the Delta Sigma Deltas and
Mikesic and McPar1and are from Psi
Omega.

Women's Vote Uncertain

Competition for the women's berths
in council are likely to be fought Out
along’ the same lines as other wom-
en's elections though there has been
very little evidence so fat, Of the
evils ‘ connected with the general

afternoon.

 

As the heaviest vote in years is
predicted by observers, students in
the six»undergi'adua__l;e schools go to
the polls this morning to ﬁll positions
open in Student Council and elect of-
ﬁcers in the College Association for
the coming year. i

37 Candidates in Office Race

Two candidates, Edward Kyper,
who was nominated for the oiﬁce of
secretary of the College, Association,
and Joseph A. Visokovicz, candidate
for senior representative from the
College, yesterday withdrew their
candidacies, leaving 37 students con-
testing for the 15 positions to be
ﬁlled in today's voting.

To forestall any repetition of voting
irregularities which have character-
ized general elections in the past,
Council acted at its meeting Wednes-
day evening to “Insure as clean and
straight an election as it is possible to
have.”

Extra surveillance will be placed on
the ballot boxes during today's ele-
tion. '  “

Each of the ﬁve ballot boxes will
have three election oﬂicials to guard
against irregularities in voting, ac-
cording to Arthur Goldberg at Wed-
nesday's Council meeting.

“A member of the supposedly so-
called coalition, a member of oneof
the non-coalition groups, and a neu-
tral student" will be on continuous
duty during the day at .- each of -..the
ballot boxes,

‘ Watchers on Continuous Duty

Two shifts are to be provided dur-
ing the day’s voting. The first group
of election officials will be stationed
at each of the ballot boxes from 9:15
to 12:45 o'clock; the second group
from that time to the closing of the
polls at 3:45 o'clock. ..
' Each student to be able to vote,
must present a registration card,
which, when voting has been com-
pleted will be crayoned with a blue
pencil. .

'Watcliers have been’--‘ instructed to
watch particularly for borrowed reg-
istration cards. An attempt will also
be made to keep solicitors from being
too near the ballot boxes or assisting
others in marking ballots. ' ' ,

Ballot boxes will be inspected and
opened by Wm. Daffenbaugh, assist-
ant to the dean of ‘men, at the be-
ginning of voting this morning.

At the completion of voting this
afternoon, the closed ballot boxes will

Dr, Alexander Silverman, head of
the chemistry department, comment-
ing on Dr.‘Noyes, says: “Dr. Noyes is
an example of the" serious individual
who applies science in an exact way
and in turn is exacting upon others.
It is this insistance upon the truth
for which science stands that has’
made his own‘ work outstanding in-
teriiationally and that has brought
recognition to many of‘ his j'fo'r‘m‘er
students. ‘ ‘ “ ‘ l ‘

“In his talk Dr. Noyes will give us,

.1 am. certain, nuclear, logical .-picture

of the situation."

League Demands

Assembly Action

 

Discusses Relief Legislation

 

The Tuesday mefeting of the student
branch, League for Social Justice,
featured a discussion of pending legis-
lation before the State Assembly and
the possibilities of action in regard
to social measures. Among the bills for
which the league demands considera-
tion are adequate, relief, old age pen-
sions, unemployment insurai_ice, min-
imum wage and maximum labor acts
proposed and child labor enactments.

Should the present. legislature fail

lto take action on the bills, now in
sub-committee, the student branch, in .

conjunction with the Pittsburgh
League for Social Justice, will de-
mand a special session to be called
by the Governor.

A letter which the group had sent;
to Governor Pinchot, asking for relféf
measures, was read to the meeting,
as was the reply of the Governor's
secretary, who assured the students
that if Mr. Pinchot makes a ‘stump
tour of the state, asking for legislative
action, he will deﬁnitely speak before a
gathering sponsored by the league.

A report of the Unemployed Citi-
zeiis League, presented by Marjorie
Hanson, Col. '34, stressed the signifi-
cance of the organization of the un-

employed. Thursday, May 11, was
set as the date for ‘the next
meeting. The group will meet at

A plan to continue the Reserve Oiﬁccrs’ Training Corps at the
University without ﬁnancial aid from the Federal Government was
announced yesterday by Lt. Col. Edward J. Cullen, head of the de-
partment of military science and tactics. ‘ '

The plan, according to Col. Cullen has met with the approval of
Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of the University, and John Weber,

 

N 0 oﬂicial action has been taken by the University because of the
absencc of Dr. Bowman and Mr. Weber, who a.re out of the city,
but it is expected that matterwill be subniitted to the Board of

The plan to contiiiue the University ROTC has grown out of

Roosevelt Directs Withdrawal

According to C01, Cullen, “no official
information is available as to the
exact administrative measures that
are to be taken: whether the ROTC
units will be entirely abolished or
whether the Federal Government will
leave all property and personnel at
the institutions and permit the’ insti-
tutions to bear the expense of support-
ing this department."

The plan was submitted to students
in the basic and advanced corps of
the ROTC last week, and in both cases
it was agreed to continue work in the
military department in the event that
the University should decide to con-
tinue military education after the Fed-
eral Government has withdrawn its
support.

Students in the advance corps will
be more affected than those registered
in the elemeiitary course. I

To the juniors and seniors, it will
mean continuing the‘ advance course
without the maintenance of $.30 a.
day w_l1icli they have been receiving,
and bearing expenses to the six weeks
Coast Artillery Corps camp at Fort
Monroe, which cost has been esti-
rgiated by Col. Cullen at approximately
.'2-.3. ‘

To Continue Without Pay

Sophomores expecting to enter the
advanced corps and juniors who have
already had one year of advance train-
ing have expressed willingness to con-
tinue without pay and to defray their
camp expenses. ‘ ’

‘ To students in the elementary
course the proposal will mean com-
pleting their courses in the basic
course. ‘

The plan submitted by Colonel Cul-
lexi indicates “that the only difficulty
whatever to’ be‘ encountered in main-
taining the Pitt ROTC in operation
for the next year or two would be the.
matter of obtaining the consent of the
,Wa.r Department to continue the army
personnel on their present duty at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Colonel Cullen suggested yesterday
that he thinks a similar movement to
maintain the ROTC will take place at
the majority of institutions now sup-
porting a military department.

Commenting on his plan for contin-
uing‘ with the“ ROTC, Cullen said,
“The most remarkable thing has been
the spirit with which the students
havesliown’ their-"willingness to carry
our ROTC ' organization "forward with-
out ﬁnancial ‘assistance from the Fed-
eral Government. The attitude‘ of the
students in understanding the ﬁnan-
cial statns of the country and their
willingness to continue" by carrying
the burden ‘themselves is nothing
short of 'marve1ous.’f‘ ‘

9'i""¢." S.P.99.e5’<.$ 1.-_'-'.“°"*

Colonel Cullen suggests in his plan
that a‘ letter be sent to“the Command-
ins General of the Third ‘Corps area
1"eque_sting that ‘the University‘ be al-
lowed tomaintain its present military
department ‘after all ﬁnancial support
has ‘been withdrawn by the govern-
ment. He says, “I would suggest that
such a letter as may be written
strongly urge, almost to the point pf
demanding, that the University ‘of
Pittsburgh be authorized to continue
its ROTC and to ‘retain the ‘services
of its "regular:-army personnel in their
present status for at least one year
beglnning July 1, 1933." ' ' '

Meanwhile, with ‘plans still hanging
ﬁre, the military department is going
ahead with preparations"‘ ‘for next year.
In the event th_atl’:he‘corps is main-
tained at ‘the University's expense
Cullen expects to have as ‘large’ 8.
corps next ‘year as “at the present

Student Health

Reports Varied Ailmentsi

 

Pitt men play no favorites when it
comes to acquiring diseases, a study
of the Student Health Service rec-
ords reveals. Complaints range from
abrasions to verrucous growths, with
an especially strong sprinkling of cp-
iderinaphytosis and furnuncles. But
those last two terms don’t indicate
that Pitt has been suffering a serious
plague; they're merely the scientiﬁc
designations for such commonplace
ailments as athlete’s foot and common
boils.

Accommodations at headquarters
over in the Falk Clinic are as elaborate
as the records which they keep. Com-
fortable leather chairs and divans,
which the Falk Foundation has al-
lotted to weary Pittites seeking an
excuse for last Wednesday's psych
lecture, make waiting a positive re-
lief. There is only one point to quibble
over, the lamentable lack of reading
material. If you care to peruse yes-
terday‘s paper or glance through a
month-old Literary Digest, you will be
satisfied. But if you have higher aims,
or if you still get a daily paper at
home, you might be inclined to trade
one of those leather chairs or a
couple of up-to-date magazines.

eight thousand calls have been made
for athletic examinations, treatments

Monday and Tuesday are the
lJ11Si<*St days for Dr. Carlson and his
assistant, Dr. Kowallis. An average
thirty patients do their best to throng
the offices then, mostly in the after-
noons. Saturday is the lightest ses-
sion, when an occasional half dozen
or so drop in. Heaviest days this
year came during football season; it:
was a bad day when the gridders
didn’t bring ten or twelve assorted
strains and bruises in for treatment.

Faulty posture, Dr. Carlson believes,
is the most common complaint of the
Pitt student body. To counteract this
he has had posters placed over the
campus comparing good and bad
posture. He hopes they have had
some effect, but he has not seen any

Pat C<:rr,Watcb In Hand,

\\’l1at’s the most cliaracteristic §
thing about Pat Corr? There might
be a (lift‘erc-nce of opinion among peo-
ple who don't know Pat well, but ask
any follow on-the-swimmiiigteam and
he'll tell you it’s those two stop
watches in l’at’s hands.

himself. Back in 1923 Pat held every
AMA swimming record from 40 yards-
to a mile. But that was ten years ago.

A couple of weeks ago Pat raced
Art Straub in a special invitation
race held in connection with the Key-
stone-PA.-‘t interclub competition. Pat
won, but he admits that “he ain’t
what he used to be."

I’at’s chairman of the swimming
committee at the Keystone Athletic
Club, but lately he's been concentrat-
ing on squash.

Coacli Corr graduated from the Pitt,
Law School in 1926 and he's been‘
quite a success as a barrister ever
since. His special forte is pleading
cases before the common pleas and
county court.

former Pitt co-ed. who played four
years of basketball when the women
had varsity teams in that sport.
There are now two rising
swimmers, or are they basketball
players. '

In the ten years that Pat has been
coaching Pitt's swiinining
there have been many outstanding
natators under his tutelage. To men-
tion only a. few, there were Pete
Bowen, Al Mango, Bus VVright, and
Steve Brodie. But Pat’s specialty is
taking a fellow who has the natural
ability, giving him lots of work, and
pushing him to new records. A typi-
cal example of this is Jack Hanna.

big days. In the first place it marks
the end 01‘ his tenth year as coach at
Pitt (Jock Sutherland also celebrated
his tenth year with a clinic.) Then
too. a crowd of 300 or more is as-
surcd. Finally the watches may have
to work overtime. because there's a
possibility that Lenore Kight, feature

lweak another world's record.

Trip With Two

turned to the campus this week.

Pitt holds two victories over the
Michigan runners, defeating them in
the recent West Virginia indoor meet
and the Butler relays, but have been

surpa.-tsetl once by the green “M” run-2

hers, this defeat coming in the indoor
E.',:1lll€S at South Bend last month.

The Panthers made their best time
a;_:ainst the Michigan relayers in the
Butler meet, settiiig an indoor record
to win the relay event in 3:23.-5.

As Ki-.“ll(-‘l‘, Kiger, Watkins and Mc-
Donald have each turned in times in
their trials of fifty seconds over a
-4-'30-yai'd course, this record might be
considerably lowered should the Penn
track be dry for the mile event.

In each of the two relay events, the
Panthers will nndoul;-tedly get the
most opposition from Manhattan, Army

was at Hawaii, where the yacht-

Politics in

The Open

ODAY we elect 3. new Student Council. It is to be hoped that

this time the “we” of that
the usual eight per cent of the

statement will mean more than
entire campus em'ol1ment. But

it is even more fervently to be hoped that today’s election,

whether fraudulent or “clean,’
“new deal” in Pitt politics.

’ will mean the assurance of 3.

There has been enough secret-, under-cover, and wholly un-
ethical political conniving on this campus in recent years to
sicken anyone. The sickening process has been so effective as to
prevent any lasting reform; those students who might have

united in an unselﬁsh house-cl

eaning have not cared to come

within the range of the ﬂying muck.

Because they have had the

necessary internal organization,

and because they have had a. deﬁnite use for the possible re-

wards, fraternities have dominated the political picture.

Itis

inherent in the so-called fraternity system" that the line-up of
“big men” in each house must be maintained. Pledges must be
attracted, and as the competition between fraternities grows,

the struggle for political domin

ation increases. Control in Stu-

dent Council offers any one fraternity or faction the beneﬁts

which it has come to look upon
And so we have had faction

a1 wa.rfa.re in and out of Student
School representation has been
the fraternity relationship. Oc-

casionally, of course, a. lone objector to the system has risen in
protest, only to receive the support of friendly jeers from one

and all.

This is an old story, one that is as familiar elsewhere as
here. Yet, somehow, it has escaped the proper scrutiny, through

,p_ublica.tion,., on our own campus

.. While many have known, and

a. few have boasted, the ambitions of all who have sacriﬁced
personal integrity for personal gain have remained as ha-lf-veiled

secrets.

Let us have a.

frank solicitation of voters’ support on the basis of adequate

We shall have politics as long as there is an elective gov-

action may remove the furtive look from many faces.

 Herron, McEliroy Announce
New Treatment For Anemia

 

By Paul

Dr. William F. Herron, demonstrator
in medicine, and Dr. William S. Mc-
Ellrory, professor of physiological
chemistry, of the University School of
Medicine, recently announced the dis-
covery of__ anpimproved method for
treatment of pernicious anemia in a
paper read at the Pan-American Med-
ical Congress at Dallas, Texas, and
in an article published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
It climaxed a. year of experimentation
and treatment with autolyzed liver in
powder form for pernicious anemia
cases. ‘

Pernicious anemia is a weakness in
blood structure. For some years 1t
has been-, known that _,eating large

vrqiatntitiesllofﬁlivor w‘ttl§“'a?*curerfor - the’

condition. The chief difficulty was
that so much liver was necessary. to
effect a. core that the patient thor-
oughly detested it and often could
not stand 3. sufficient quantity. Last
April Drs. Herron and McE1lroy set
out tofiud :3, new method of treating
the liver in’ order to utilize it in a
concentrated. form. They hit upon
autolysis as the method.

Autolysis is merely the sel1'—diges-

State Co'm,mittee Plans '
For High School Guidance

P. W, Hutson, associate professor of

education, attended the meeting of
the State Executive Committee on
Guidance at Harrisburg last Wednes-
day." .-Mr. Hutson is 3. member of the
committee.

The object or the session was the
formulation of plans and suggestions
for the guidance program in second-
ary schools in connection with the
ten-year program for Pennsylvania
schools. Under the leadership of
James N. Rule, state superintendent
of public instruction, educators over
the state are engaged in collecting in-
formation for ‘the program.

tion of tissue, due to the action of
the enzymes contained in every cell.
The advantage of using this autolyzed
liver powder is obvious. Costing much
less. it is superior in potency and
palatability. For example, it usually
requires from one-fourth to one-half
pound" "of liver daily to maintain a
patient with pernicious auomia, where-
as about one teaspoonful daily of the
powder is sufficient.

When the process has been de-
veloped, tests of the new material
were made on approximately fifty
anemic cases throughout this section
of the country. Dr. Herron, who read
the Dallas report, summarized ‘the
successful results of these tests.

'I‘he process has been submitted for
approval -’~to«-the "Council of «’Ph‘a'rmacy"
and Chemistry of the American Med-
ical Association. Awaiting this ap-
proval, plans have been made for the
marketing of the autolyzed powder
through reputable drug houses to the
medical profession. Since no two
cases of anemia are ever entirely sim-
ilar, .and- since the required dosage
may vary from day to day, the prep-
aration will be administered only by
Dhysicians. '

BY DON EARLY

 

The L('.e‘Sll1g J. Roseuwald collection of ﬁne prints in the Car-
negie Galleries is one of the most interesting and inclusive of the
year. For vvhereas it has been difficult to mass :1. group of paintings
by prominent artists and virtually impossible to get an extensive
collection of masterpieces in oil, the number of copies of great prints
the world over has made it possible to bring together many of the
works of the fine print makers from the ﬁfteenth century forward.

Almost every school and every typee

of print from that time down to our
own is represented.

The exhibition begins with the Ger-
man primitives,’ anonymously exe-
cuted, but showing in their naiveté-. a
deep religious sincerity. These were
intended for the masses of illiterate
for whom pictures had more import-
ance in coiiiniuilicating knowledge
than for us, and we can easily im-
agine the wliole-heartecl acceptance of
the divine in these crude 1‘epre'senta-
tions. ’l‘he earliest block is The Hand
with the Mirror of Salvation, dated

“factum anno 1166,” and colored in-

red, crimson, green, yehow, and
black. It, too, is anonymous.
A number of the Italian masters
were superior in engraving. The ex-
hibition includes some particularly
ﬁne examples of the work of Andrea
Mantegna, probably the most import-
ant and inﬂuential of the early Ital-
ians. His Virgin and Child is a fault-
less piece of platework. But the fin-
est of the Italians is Pollaluolo, and
his The Battle of the Nudes, the only
engraving ascribed to him, is certain-

‘ 1y one of the consummate examples

in the -whole collection.

Many of l;11o""("=.‘«‘ei"u‘1a11 Inasters fol-
low, too numerous to mention. But
Martin Schongauer and Israhel van
Meckeuem ought not be passed up,
the first for his Death of the Virgin,
already foreshadowing Durer, and
the latter for an impre,~;sive Presenta-
tion in the Temple and Ornament of
the Tree of Jessee. In the sixteenth
century, the golden age of engraving,
the great Durer and Lucas van Ley-
rlen are the lnusters. ’I‘l1e-re are m‘.-my
Durers, not a few among the finest;
Adam and Eve, Knight, Death and the
Devil, St. Eustache, the Four Horse-
men of the Apocalypse. In addition,
a. ﬁne portrait of Du1'er’s friend,
Dcsiderius Erasmus, is included. Ley-
den in almost the equal of Durer, and
in the Net.l1er1ands he exerted as
much influence as did Durer in Ger-
many. The Milkmaid is certainly as
ﬁne as anytliing Durer ever did.

In the seventeenth century Van
Dyke and Rembrandt appear. The
work of these two men helps to re-

veal the gains made in the technical

facilities and general freedom of ex-
lecution during the latter part of the

preceding century. Five of Van
Dyke’s po1't1'aits., Erasm us, Fran
Franken, Jan Snelllnx, Lucas Vors-

terman, and the portrait of Van
Dyke himself are among the most
important prints in the exhibition.
The Rembrandts are Iiumerous. The
most superb of these are Beggar in
High Cap, Standing and Leaning on
a Stock, Rembrandt’s Mother Seated
at a Table and Looking Right, Rem-
brandt with Plumed Hat and Lower-
ed Saber, Christ Healing the Sick,
Dr. Faustus, Jan Lutma. the Elder.
The eighteenth century is hardly
an age of great etchers and engrav-
ers. ’l‘o be sure we have Goya, and
Hogarth, and Blake, truly a man of
great genius and origlna.1il:y', but on
the whole, most of the engraving
practiced was in mezzotint reproduc-
tions. It is the nineteenth century
that stands out again. M/e have the
introduction of a new process, that of
lithography .and the masterly accom-
plishment in this ﬁeld is only too well
shown in the works of the French-
men, Delacroix, Duumier, and Raffct.
The French etchers, also, are notable:
Charles Meryon, for his La Morgue

» and L’Abside; Alphoue Legro, for his

Death . of .-the Vagabond.  .In England
W'histler commands. Many of his
etchings are included, several master-
ly portraits, and the amazing, The
Embroidered Curtain, which closely
approaches his supreme achievement.

’ And down to the twentieth century,
A large number of our contempora-
ries aro included in the exhibition
drawn‘ from France, England, and
America. The British are represent-
ed by Gerald Brockhurst, Arthur
Briscoe, Robert Austin, Laura. Knight,
Augustus Johns. Frederick Griggs,
Edmund Blanpied, and Sir Fra.nk
Short. France. has Besard, Renoir,
Matisse, Forain, and America is rep-
resented "by Rockwell Kent, William
I-Ieintzelman, Martin Lewis, William
M. Meyerowitz, Louis Rosenberg,
Walter Tittle, Ernest Roth, and Wil-
liam Auerback Levy. _ p

' Such an "é.xl1ibitio11 affords the
print lovers of'Pittsburgh a rare and
valuable opportunity to become fa-
miliar with many of the great prints
in the history of graphic art.

Edwards To Conduct War
"Poll  ‘University Soon

 

A poll on the Pitt campus regarding

I students’ willingness to participate in

future wars _will be conducted within
the next few weeks, according to
plans being completed‘ by ‘William Ed-
wards, Col. ’33, chairman of the war
poll committee.

The Pitt questionnaire will be one
of many being given in colleges
throughout the -country ‘under the
leadership of the Brown University
Daily Herald, and will indicate three
possible choices for students. The
first blank declares, “I will not par-
ticipate in any war.” The secbnd
choice contains the declaration that
the student will not participate in any
war, "unless the shores of the United
States are invaded.” The final blank
maintains the present question for ad-
mission to citizenship—that the stu-
dent will participate in any war de-

creed by the President and Congress.

Cap-Gowners

To Celebrate‘

Dance Tonight, Tomorrow's
Banquet Close Year

‘While “All to the Point” prepares"

for its final performances at the
Nixon Theater tonight and tomorrow,
members of the cast, the chorus, and
various staffs are planning activity
besides recreating the Pittsburgh of
1789 to gaping audiences.

Tonight, following the performance
for which the greatest number of
student reservations have been made,
the members of the show will retire
to the Nixon Cafe for their custom-
bound annual dance. Tomorrow aft-
ernoon, the cast; the chorus", and staff
members along with graduate Cap and
Gowners, will meet for their yearly
banquet.

After the banquet proper, the award-
ing; of keys will be-made, with two
years’ service the prerequisite for
cast and chorus members, and three
years’ work necessary for “bit” part
men and staff workers. Included in
the entertainment will be the Valedic-
tory of graduating seniors, led by
James Holland, Bus. Ad. ’33, president
of the Undergraduate Cap and Gown
Club. Author G.Nor1nau Reis and the
lyric and score writers of “All to the
Point” will also speak.

Mayor Herron and members of City
Council attended last night’s perform-
ance of the show after being ofﬁcially
invitedby Holland and Russell Con-
nelley, Col. ’35, who play lead roles
and appeared before the councilmen
in costume. Holland is Craig Forbes
and C-onnelley makes up as Melissa.
lvlarbury in the production. Wednes-
day nig'ut’s show included in the audi-
ence members of the Chicago Cubs
and the Pittsburgh Pirate baseball
teams.

The largest cast and chorus in the
four years that VVillia1n F. lvlarlatt
has directed the all-male affairs takes
part in the colonial romance this year.
Twenty-ﬁve are numbered in thecast
alone. Twenty more in each of the
choruses. an octette, and an auxiliary
trio, complete the players’ list. In ad-
dition, approximately twenty-ﬁve men
have worked on" the business and the
production staffs.

“A11 to the Point,” the twenty—sixth
annual extravaganza of the Cap and
Gown Club, is taking all the attention
of group members for the present.
No plans have as yet been made, ac-
cording to club oﬂicers, for. the com-
ing year. That there will be a. 1934
show, however, is practically certain.
