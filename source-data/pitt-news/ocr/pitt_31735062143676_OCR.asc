(Continued From Page One.)

At the supp'er~meeting last night
speakers incluided Dr-. -J. Wallace
Petty, D. D., pastor Oif the First Bap-
tist _Church, and -B. F. Ashe, under-
gradua.te_a.dvisor of, the University.
Music was »furnished by: an orchestra
under the direction of Paul I-Iindered.
Yells and songs ﬁlled out the pro-
" gram. . ‘

Dr. Petty, the principal speaker of
the meeting, gave-_a. stirring address

V I similar to’ the one delivered before

the College "a few Weeks ago. In his
last night’s speech, he urged students
present to get the spirit of the drive.
“If you do, the rest WOIll1d be easy,”
he assured them. '

The campaign is endorsed by all
campus leaders and a number of
faculty heads. It is supported ‘by
such, men __ as _Chancell'or John G.
Bowman, Dr, S. B. Linhart, ‘Dean
Ashe and Lee Frank. Considering the
many» «beneﬁts the students in the
University get from the organization,
‘it is expected" that it will receive
their hearty "pecuniary support.

Panther improved. ,

_ The improvement that the Panther
_ showed over the Carnegie aﬁair two
weeks‘ ago bodes. good» for chances
against ~Wash—Je'ﬁ and State after
the Geneva game has been ‘elimin-
ated.-' The primary defense-threw out
a stiﬁer front. the terminals moved
‘faster, and the backs, on’ the offen-
sive, were willing to run more risks
and threw a heavier charge. into the
. ‘Syrac-uise~1ine when the punch was
needed at the goal. '.The.-play of
1bOth teams, though, suffered from
frequent fumbles by‘. the backs, both
touchdowns resulting and several
’ others failing from errors. Officials’
pienal-ties, drawn frequently for long
setbacks, altered the play by rob-
hing both elevens of hotly contested

' gains. ‘
_ On the other
backﬁeld,  McBride, ranked‘, as
l the east’s leading fullback, failed to
{show all of the speed that it is said
to have the w_ho»le_ quartet showing
» only ﬂashles that were useless, be-

'j   3 cause the Panther ’-backs kept them

from getting into the open,‘ As a
' result, the two touchdowns -» which;
Wsyracuse was supposed to be better

than the Panther didn’t materialize.

McBrid-e,. however, surpheld his own’

reputation with his consistent line

pllunging which brought gain aifter
- gain on a majority "of the team's
plays. His famous ﬁel-d goals, one of

, which ‘defeated Pitt in. the Yankee

  «'Sl_tadiu‘m last year, «could not figure

.n in the scoring, for he blew three of
 gthree attempts. His failure can be
attributed to the sloppy: ﬁeld -and the
 strong ‘wind that "swept it for the

_ whole game. _ ~ » -

A “ , , AF'o|ey.StandS Oult. , .
