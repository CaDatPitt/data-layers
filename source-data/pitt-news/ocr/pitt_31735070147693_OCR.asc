Graduating seniors face

tough job prospects   c

Despite reports of economic re-
covery, Pennsylvania’s unemploy-
ment statistics suggest that tough
times still loom for students who
plan to graduate this May.

Last month, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor reported that last

year the average unemployment
rates rose in 31 states. .
Pennsylvania ‘experienced a
0.7 percent increase in unemploy-
ment from 20091-to 2010. This
places the state’s averaged-for 2010
at 8.7 percent — th’at’s below the
national average,’w‘hich was 9.6
percent. Last yearfis‘ national av-
erage rose 0.3 percent over the
previous year.

 

These ﬁgures caused conster-
nation among a few of the about
3,500 whowill -graduate from
Pitt in May. The ceremony itself

-is a month and a halfaway, and

many students have started the
job search. A  . l

SGB hears student inputabout Corbett budget

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Student concerns over proposed state budget
cuts dominated the Student Government
Board meeting last night in Nordy’s Place.

Gov. Tom Corbett’s budget, announced
last week, calls for cuts that would eliminate
almost $900 million in education spending.
Pitt’s state appropriations would be reduced
by more than half — from $185 million to
$80.2 million dollars. ,

The budget still has to go through a series

of hearings and amendments by the state
legislature before it is passed. The deadline
for passage is June 30. '

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, during a
news conference last week, said the cuts
could ultimately result in tuition increases
for students.

Board President Molly Stieber and gov-
ernmental relations chair Kyle Miller pub-
licized through Facebook that part of this
week’s board meeting would be used as a
forum for students to come and speak on

- the issue.

Stieber altered the structure of the meet-

ing by beginning with allocations requests.
The meeting was suspended at 9:17 p.m. after
all 12 allocations requests were heard and
resumed 40 minutes later after students
spoke about the cuts, so the Board could hear
committee reports. The meeting adjourned
at 10:19 p.m. '

Although the room wasn’t as full as Board
member Ryan Gayman had hoped, most stu—
dent leaders stayed after having their re-
quests heard. Additionally, about 15 students
strolled in after 9 p.m. and sat on the sides
to listen to the discussion, bringing total
attendance to about 35 students.

Hyla Wallis, an out— of—state senior at Pitt,
brought up the issue of how to get students
whose permanent residence isn’t in Penn-

sylvania involved in the campaign to show’

state legislators that cuts would be unaccept-
able. Out-of—state students pay signiﬁcantly

’ more than in—state students, about $24,000 «

compared to about $14,000 for Arts & Sci-
ences students.

Stieber said Pitt students from all states
should get involved, because cuts in Penn-
sylvania could affect other public education
systems throughout the country.

“The country is really looking at us now,”

Cotton Club adds spice, dance skills

Emily Riley
Staﬁ’ Writer

All it takes is_a shimmy to add a little
spice.

Members of Pitt’s Cotton Club, a stu-
dent dance group, learned all about using
shimmying and upper body movement
in Salsa dancing this month. The group
returned from a four-year hiatus last fall,
when it once again received certiﬁcation
from Pitt’s Student Organization Resource
Center.

Shimmying, combined with upper body
movement, is one of the main ingredients
in local Salsa instructor Marlon Silva’s
“Salsa sauce,” which he taught to students
in Pitt’s Cotton Club at its last meeting..

Using the sounds of wooden blocks
to tap out the rhythm, Silva also taught
members of the student dance group how
to Mambo.

Named after a popular New York night-
club that gained a reputation for its music
during Prohibition in the ’2os, the Cotton
Club embraces all types of dance.

The club’s relationship with several
Pittsburgh dance groups and companies
gives its members the opportunity to learn
different dance moves every month. The

dance groups provide instruction for free
and members can learn anything from
Tangos to classic ballroom dances.

Cotton Club vice president Anna Powell
said the meetings receive differing levels
of interest depending on the type of dance
being taught that month.

The Cotton Club will hold its next
semimonthly meeting on March 28. It
will feature West Coast swing, which club
members said is more “contemporary”
than East Coast swing and incorporates
steps similar to Salsa.

“It is a really great way for people to
learn exactly what they want, since the
steps change per month,” Powell said.
“We just want this to be a space for kids
to dance.” ‘

The group usually has more -than a

   ‘P   
 
 latgéstr-P'9i.¢9ti°h screen inthecw     

 

dozen attendees, and the ratio between
men and women is typically conducive
for partner dancing, she added.

‘During the salsa lessons, there were

.enough partners to go around.

After the students learned how to add

some spice to their dancing, the room in

 

the ﬁfth floor of the William Pitt Union 

literallyfheated up as they started the
strenuous exercise.

“You burn about 10 calories per minute
doing this step, so congratulations, you
all just burned 800 calories,” Silva told
the class after it ended. The group did not
have a single break during the 80-minute
session. .

Despite the hard work, many still ﬁnd
the dancing enjoyable. .

One first-timer to the Pitt Cotton Club

 

meetings, Pitt alumnus Ryan Lauer, wiped
the sweat off his forehead as he explained
that his friend convinced him to check out
the dance lesson-.

“It helps me to overcome my own
shyness and to meet interesting people,”
Lauer said. .

Powell explained the dance club pro-
vides more than just the beneﬁt of learn-
ing to dance. : A

“It is a great way to interact. It’s fun
and easy and it is definitely a great form
of exercise,” she said.

Although televised dancing shows typi-
cally feature dancers in extravagant out-
ﬁts, the club’s dress code is more casual.

“Heels are not necessary, just cloth-
ing that you can move around in,” said
Cotton C.lub’s business manager, Bella
Salamone.

She added that most students wear ca-
sual clothing to the meetings. T

The ‘meetings have consistent atten-
dance, but the group is hoping for in-
creased membership." _

Club president and sophomore Victoria
was one ofthe leaders who helped rejuve-
nate interest in the club.

“We hope to see more interest in the
club in the near future. It’s just a lot of
fun. I love it,” Steger said.

High jobless rates mark fragility of economic rec

Economy (1

this summer before focusing on a
long-term job search. One student
in the College of Business Admin-
istration said he — luckily —— had
already secured employment.

Communication major Kyle
McGillivray felt frustrated with
the lack of jobs available to col-
lege graduates.

_ “It’s, like, impossible to ﬁnd
entry-level jobs,” McGillivray
said.

She plans to get an internship
if she can’t ﬁnd a job that actually
requires a college degree. _

V “I don’t want to feel like I
wasted almost $100,000,” she
said. The New York native pays
out—o_f-state tuition, which rose
to $23,732 last "year, up from
$20,686 her freshman year.

She has applied for internships
in New York at the Glimmerglass
Opera and the Saratoga Perform-
ing Arts Center. ‘ ‘

One lecturer in Pitt’s econom-
ics department,]ames Maloy, sug-

' gested that an economic recovery

without substantial job creation
cannot be considered a true re-
covery.

The high unemployment rate _

might be evidence that a recov-
ery is not in the near future, he
said. 1
Injanuary 2011, Pennsylva-
nia had 194 mass-layoff events —
which involved at least 50 people
losing their jobs —— and more than
16,000 unemployment insurance
claims, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.

The only states with higher
claims rates were New York and
California —-with 24,950 and
44,274 respectively. ”

English writing major Kelsey
Ballance said she had yet to start
truly‘ looking for a" job and was
moreconcerned with getting
through the semester.

“I have a summer job lined up,”
Ballance said. “But ndthing after

' that.”

She will teach marching band
kids at a summer camp, which she
saidshe-has been doing the past
couple of years. '

Professor Maloy said he be-
lieved many other students might
continue their education for eco-
nomic reasons. .

“If there aren’t better oppor-
tunities out there and if [graduate
school] can be done at a reason-
able price,” he said, “it’s a decent
option.” ” '

Still, he warned students
against going into debt for a post-
graduate degree without doing
thorough research on the ﬁeld. He
said students should make sure

they will be able to ﬁnd a job that
makes the cost of the degree — a
function of time forgone in the
workforce and debt accumulated
-7 Worthwhile. . I

“More education is not neces-
sarily better,” he added. “If the
cost and time associated with do-
ing an additional degree don’t pay
for themselves, then it is a poor
investment.”

‘Maloy said some degrees are
worse than others, and singled
out law degrees as one such in-
vestment. .

“Right_now people with law
degrees are struggling,” he said,
because they have a huge amount
of debt. ' V

Maloy reminded students who
are thinking of going for a post-

a

graduate degree that under cur- _

rent legislationstudents cannot
generally eliminate their loans by
declaring bankruptcy.

f‘Acquiring student loan debt is
not something to be taken light-
ly,” Maloy said‘ '

Chris Marth, a senior market-
ing and ﬁance major inthe College
of Business Administration, said
he received a job offer from an
internship he completed with En-
terprise, a rental car "company.

“The best advice in the job
search is to broaden your ho-
rizons,” Maloy said. “Apply for
many different things if you can’t
ﬁnd your ideal job.”

Maloy said experience is key
in ﬁnding a position.

“It’s generally easier toﬁnd a
new job if you already have one,”
he added, warning that students
quickly become undesirable by

‘ employers if they sit around with-

out a job.

“Concentrate on showing the
employer what you can offer,” he
concluded, “rather than on what
you think the employer should be
doing for you.” Q '

the club would plan and set a date for the
spring semester event, which she said will
be a dance party. Cervone said that al—

though they haven’t ﬁnalized any details ,

yet, plans are still in development for that
event.

The club members try to create a laid-
back atmosphere when they play at 7:30
p.m. on Monday nights between Posvar
and the Hillman Library, weather per-
mitting. Music usually accompanies the
games, and although the club’s constitu-

ing the club.

“Once you get past the misconceptions
you have about it and get rid of the ex-
cuses and actually play, it’s a lot of fun,”
Khalbuss said. . -

, Khalbuss joined because he walked past
the club on multiple occasions and started
looking into an organization he could join
on campus that wasn’t too strict or selec-
tive with its membership.

Cervone joined because he saw the club
at the activities fair and decidedjthat it
would be fun. A year later, he is now the

of players for unsportsmanlike behaviors;

Cervone said that this is unsurprisingly

not a problem. ’
“Nobody shows up to, like, win 4—square,

or get too intense about it,” he said. For

the members of the 4—square Club, it is all I

about a fun way to relieve stress.

The club isn’t just for people who:

played the gamein elementary school.
While Cervone said he enjoys the nostalgic
aspect of it, the club’s business manager,
Feras Khalbuss, said he had only played
the game about three times before join-

president.
The game is played with a rubber ball

on four numbered individual squares in?

side a bigger square outlined on aihard
surface. The group compares the game to
pingpong: the ball can bounce only once
in your square, and if it bounces twice or
bounces in your square and then out of
the large square, you are out. Somebody
then enters the first square, and everybody

The object of the game is to maintain
the fourth square for as long as possible.
The club refers to this square as the “king
square.”

, Holding that square comes with the
privilege of making your own rule. These
novelty rules last for one game.

Cervone said his favorite rule is the
“Nick Rule.”

“It’s named for a former vice president
[who still plays with the club]. The rule is,
if you don’t get.Nick out, then everybody
is out,” he said.

Khalbuss said he invented his favorite
rule, which he named “Three Kings.”

“Basically how it works is that you put
three people in the king square and then
one person in each other square. I made
it just to create chaos. People were like,
‘What are you doing?’ but it was fun,” he
said.

Khalbuss also likes the rule because he
said sometimes the better players “hog
the king square,” but his rule gives more
access to the top spot.

Yousef based her favorite rule, “Im-
perative Dancing,” on her propensity to
“shake her butt involuntarily” to the mu-
sic. When she occupies the king square,
she demands that the other players shake
along with her.

  ‘Nick Rule’ a club favorite

Her other favorites include “T-Rex
Arms,” where all players need to keep
their elbows attached to their sides, and
the”“Kick the Cup” rule. Kick the Cup came
about as a play on the “Cup Rule.” A cup
is placed at the center of the square, and
if somebody knocks it over, they are out.
Kick the cup then dictates that a player
who is out gets to kick the cup as hard as
he or she can after getting out.

“It’s a nice consolation prize for los-
ing,” she said. I

“I’m not sure this is the type of trend-

Board member Alex Zimmerman added
later in the discussion that the kind of cuts

versity would certainly be cut.

“This is happening to us now, but you

Stieber and Seth Bush, a junior electri-

Stieber said that the media has a short at-

Bush mentioned that students generally

do not turn out in large numbers to the polls,

anything.” i

Riehle encouraged students to use their
“zealousness” and educate themselves. If

Recovery dorms
make sense  

he University goes to consid-
, erable lengths to protect us
from drinking.

From banning alcohol in all
freshman dorms to restricting the
amount 21-year-olds may carry into
their dorms to shooting down alco-
hol anmesty proposals, Pitt’s admin-
istration demonstrably cares about
inﬂuencing the drinking culture in
Oakland. After all, even considering
its socially lubricative applications,
alcohol — when used in anunbridled
fashion — can throw people and uni-
versities into not only embarrassing
situations, but also dangerous ones.
So Pitt’s caring about student drink-
ing behavior is responsible.

We’d like to see Pitt expand upon
its care by adopting new programs,

including more resources ‘for stu— ‘

dents recovering from alcohol de-
pendence, and by helping students
become more aware of currently
available resources.

According to an article in Mon-
day’s edition of USA Today, insti-
tutions of higher education are es-

tablishing formalized on—campus

recovery programs for students who

have suffered from alcohol depen-

dence. Several schools, including
Rutgers University and the Univer-
sity of Vermont, run recovery resi-

dence halls, in which students can

live without the fear of temptation
or an unsupportive atmosphere, ac-
cording to the article.

Considering that more than 32
percent of American college students

might meet the criteria for alcohol.

abuse, according to one Harvard
study, we think more colleges should
be opening exclusive residence halls
for interested students. Pitt could be’
another pioneer.

Alcohol dependence, formerly '

termed “alcoholism,” is deﬁned

' by the Diagnostic and Statistical

Manual for Psychiatric Disorders

as “a maladaptive pattern of alcohol
use, leading to clinically signiﬁcant
impairment or distress.” Criteria in-
clude developing tolerance, drinking
more than intended and experienc-
ing withdrawal effects after discon-
tinuing alcohol use. ’

Pitt spokeswoman Patricia White
said Pitt is already equipped to treat
students recovering fromalcohol

dependence. The Counseling Cen— -

ter features a full-time clinician,
designated the “drug and alcohol
specialist,” who can offer therapy to
“students presenting with alcohol/
dependency issues” and who can
refer more serious cases to outside

providers, White said in an e-mail. .

The specialist also runs a support
group for students who have had
past issues with drug dependency,

but White said the program “is not —

designed speciﬁcally for students
recovering from alcohol depen-
dence.” A

It’s wonderful that Pitt has es-
tablished on-campus resources to
help troubled students recover, but
the University shouldn’t stop there.
Rutgers didn’t, and it’s formalized
on—campus recovery program —
complete with recovery housing —-—
has been catering to student needs
for decades, according to the USA

I Today article. There’s no reason Pitt

shouldn’t make more of an effort.
It’s no secret that students en-

gage in underage drinking — just ‘

because Pitt restricts certain stu-
dents from drinking in dorms and
on Pitt property doesn’t mean they
cannot regularly go out partying.
And for vulnerable students, shar-
ingbathrooms and common rooms
with heavy drinkers can serve as a
constant reminder of the stereotypi-
cal college drinking culture. Offer-
ing recovery housing is one novel
way to help remove temptation and
promote student health. I

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

How to give great text

Cashing in your text=based wooing skills, Moustache-style

   
 

_ Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Striking up a conversation with
a perfect stranger happens often
here on campus, especially in those
enormous Intro to Psychology
courses. You’ll exchange the usual
pleasantries, lying about your high
school sports career if you’re a guy
or secretly critiquing the person if
you’re a girl. By the end, it might
appear as though you’ve found your
next best friend or perhaps even the

. love of your life.

But wait —-— where do you go
from here? '

Partings, which once brought
such sweet sorrow, can now7be

delayed indeﬁnitely thanks to the
_ magic of the Internet. After you’ve

acquainted yourself with this new
pal, you can send him or her a
friend request on Facebook. From
there, though, it can get a bit messy
— and that’s where we stand ready
to help. Now that you’ve made con-
tact, you’re going to need to engage
in some great text if you want to
draw this person into your inner

circle. We at the Moustache Column
of America have more—or-less per-
fected the art of text, and we’re go-
ing to share the hot tips and tricks
that are sure to leave any partner
feeling textually satisﬁed.

Start by getting this person’s
attention. Whether you go for the
gusto by messaging him on his cel-
lular phone or just wait around for
hours on Gmail chat until he logs
on, here’s a great opener:

‘USERNAME1: sup

“Sup” is a very versatile phrase.
It’s_ cool and laid-back, with a hint of
mystery behind it. It’s undoubtedly
the way James Bond would con-
tact a Bond girl if his laser—shooting
wristwatch had a text—messaging
feature. Let’s continue the conver-
sation: —

URNEWFRIEND: nm u _

Hmm, doesn’t seem like much is
happening on your newfriend’s end.
We’ll try to take it up a notch.

USERNAME1: cool

URNEWFRIEND: lol how r u

You’ve got him now! With the »

deployment of a single incongru-
ous “cool,” he’s already laughing

out loud. In response to his query, .

offer some insights regarding the
amazing life into which you’re try-
ing to invite him.

USERNAME1: chillin u

URNEWFRIEND: lol

Oh man, this is escalating fast.
Pretty soon you guys will be braid-
ing one another’s hair at a slumber
party. But play it coy —-— there’s no
need to give the game away yet.

USERNAME1: :D

URNEWFRIEND: lol

Yep, that big smiley emoticon
came at just the right time. It was
getting a bit too tense, and the
mood needed to be lightened. From
here, you’re home free. Time for a
great closing line.

USERNAME1: u wanna hang

URNEWFRIEND: yah ok lol

Although most textual en-
counters will go as smoothly as
this one, some might require a
bit more awesomeness on your

part. Here’s where a storehouse of ‘

clever phrases can really save the
day. Some particularly helpful ones
include “lmao,” if you’d like to push
the hilarity to its highest possible

IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN

 

Freeze production of U.S. nuclear plants

Molly Green
Columnist

Last weekend, japan was rocked,
whipped and literally shattered
into pieces by an 8.9-magnitude
earthquake and subsequent tsuna-
mi. Days later, the country raced to
avertanuclear meltdown after three
nuclear reactors suffered explosions
brought on by the geological ass-
whipping.

Radiation measurements in

Saitama, Japan, are at 40 times nor-
mal levels, and radiation levels are at
10 times normal in Tokyo, according

. to MSNBC. Although not possess-

ing radiation lev_els high enough to
cause harm to humans, countries
like China have begun mass evacu-
ations of their citizens fromJapan’s
northeast.

Now what’s being called the
“world’s worst nuclear crisis since
Chernobyl” has the world question-
ing the future of nuclear power.

It’s a ﬁnicky situation. On the
one hand, the world is dangerously
reliant on fossil fuels. According to
the World Resources Institute, fos-
sil fuels supply about 90 percent of
the world’s commercial energy and

account for more than 80 percent‘

of the carbon dioxide released into
the'atinosphere each year.

Given this, reliance on fossil fu-
els is costly and dangerous, espe-
cially for countries like Japan, the
fourth largest consumer of energy
worldwide, and the United States,
the largest.

Accordingly, many have viewed
]apan’s vast network of 55 operating
nuclear power plants, which contrib-
ute aboutso percent of the country’s
energy, according to the Interna-

tional Atomic Energy Agency, as the _

preferable, more environmentally
conscious option.

In the United States, nuclear
energy has enjoyed a recent spike
in bipartisan support, especially in
the aftermath of last year’s oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico. Last February,

‘ President Barack Obama pledged

more than $8 billion in additional

’ loan guarantees to the construction

of the ﬁrst U.S. nuclear power plant
in nearly three decades, according
to The Washington Post.

And in his 2011 State ofthe Union
address, the president proposed an
expansion of $36 billion in Depart-
ment of Energy loan guarantees for

the construction of as many as 20
new nuclear plants.

Nuclear energy has also received
support from Republican leaders,
such as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey
Graham and Kentucky Sen. Mitch
McConnell, and even from some
environmentalists. A 1

Stewart Brand, afounder of envi-

' ronmental publication Whole Earth

Catalog, explained, “Its not that
something new and important and
good had happened with nuclear, it’s
that something new and important
and bad has happened with climate
change,” according to The New York
Times. .

A March 2010 Gallup poll found
that 62 percent of Americans sup-
ported nuclear energy. Likewise,
according to The Independent,
a survey found that 54 percent of
people in the United Kingdom would
be willing to support the -building

of new nuclear power stations if it .

would help solve global warming.
Of course, that still‘ means that
nearly half of the population was op-
posed to nuclear energy even before
the crisis injapan. A
Bottom line: The energy crisis is a
divisive issue. And it is an incredibly

important one.

These days, it seems like most

Americans are myopic, occupied
with issues like the economy or
foreign affairs — things that affect
them today. Meanwhile, the energy
crisis looms in the distance.
_ And it’s distressing that it takes a
tragedy like the events of last week-
end to have people yet again ques-
tioning whether nuclear energy has
a place in the future of world energy
production.

Already, McConnell and Sen.
Chuck Schumer, D—N.Y., have gone
on record saying that they still sup-
port expanding nuclear power capa-
bilities in the United States, accord-
ing to The Hufﬁngton Post.

But other politicians ﬁnd the
events a cause for concem._ Rep. Ed
Markey, D-Mass., has called for a
moratorium on reactors in seismi-
cally active areas and Sen. Joe Lie-
berman, I- Conn., a leader in energy
reform, recently said on CBS’s “Face
the Nation,” “I think it calls on us
here in the U.S., naturally, not to stop
building nuclear power plants, but
to put the brakes on right now until
we understand the ramiﬁcations of p
what’s happened injapan.”

The fact is, our dependence on
fossil fuels is dangerous, and we
should belookingfor energy alterna-

tives. But nuclear energy is too risky. '

After Chernobyl and the Three Mile
Island accidents, engineers worked
tomake nuclear energy plants saf-
er. And they are safer, but not safe
enough. .

Most of all, I think all can agree
that nuclear power plants should not
be constructed in extremely active
subduction zones, especially on
coasts where they are also suscep-
tible to tsunamis, like injapan — or
on the California coast, where there
are two operating nuclear power
plants and four commercial nuclear
power plants.

Even if it seems ﬁnancially
counterintuitive, the United States

should cease the construction of »

new nuclear energy plants and cer-
tainly must reevaluate the safety of
existing plants, especially those on
the California coast. As for the $36
billion? We should redirect those
funds to wind and solar energy de-
velopment — they are cleaner and
safer options.

you remain unsure about the age

Emoticons are also valuable.
While “:)” is good for most of your
needs, “:/” can come in handy if
you’re trying to seem as aloof and
thoughtful as singer—songwriter
Conor Oberst. “:(“, however, should
be saved for special occasions, such

as when you’re trying to convey the

sort of melancholy found almost

exclusively in Romantic poetry.
Occasionally these stock mes-

I sages won’t suﬂice, as your textual

partner might demand that you
actually take the time to type out
your opinion about something or
someone. This might seem like a
daunting task given your myriad

other responsibilities, but a simple

“sux” or “rulz” can offer closure for .

even the most textually insatiable. _
Check out this example:
URNEWFRIEND: u like the
black eyed peas
USERNAME1: yah peas rulz
Many scholarly big shots have
claimed that texting has under-
mined the art of conversation, but

use ‘sux’

we’d beg to differ. In our humble
opinion, texting has refined con-
versation by simplifying it down
to its barest elements. What bet-
ter way is there to get at a person’s
state of mind than to type out the
three letters that comprise “sup”?
What more is there to say about the
Black Eyed Peas beyond the fact
that they “rulz”? Man might be able

or ‘rulz’

to live without food for weeks, but
textual deprivation is another mat-
ter entirely.

A mass of people taking to the streets

’ to protest abill affecting immigrants
. inspired director Esau Melendez to

create a ﬁlm about the movement.
He believes that when he started
the process four years ago in 20'06,
people didn’t realize how big this
issue would become.

“Half a 'million people marched.
in the streets to stop a bill that would
crirninalize the people,” he said, re-

ferring to proposed and strength-
ened border security,. “...This has to

‘I be the biggest movement in the his-

tory of immigrants, butl don’t think
anyone saw what happened in May
2006. This movement is for people
who are here contributing to society
and who want to be recognized but
are forced into the shadows.”

From those experiences, he came

up with the idea for “Immigrant Na— _

tion! The Battle for a Dream.” The
director will appear at both of the
screenings of his documentary at
the upcoming Carnegie Mellon
University 2011 International-Film
Festival. .

In its ﬁfth year, the ﬁlm festival
will feature a number of ﬁlms ex-
ploring issues related to migration,
explaining what drives people to im-
migrate and the impact the move-
ments have on both the countries
people leave and the countries they

Films highlight complexities of immigration

move to.
Though its theme changes annu-
ally, the ﬁlm festival always brings
in award-winning ﬁlms and docu-
mentaries with “artistic merit” from
around the world, festival director
Jolanta Lion said in an e-mail.
Every year, Lion said she looks
for “independent, foreign and
documentary feature—length ﬁlms
that have not yet premiered here in
Pittsburgh and on occasion that have
not premiered in the United States”
that connect with the festival theme.
Even students can submit through a

. short-ﬁlm competition.

Lion has a strong history in ﬁlm,
teaching in Poland and then at Pitt up
until 2006. Now the director of the
ﬁlm festival, Lion is able to “take part
in the world of ﬁlm” in a new way by
distributing different works to the
audience in a “thematic way.”

“The Word of God: Sandow
Birk’s American Qur’an”
Sandow Birk

Andy Warhol Museum

117 Sandusky St.

412-237-8300

It takes a while to copy 141 chap-
ters of an ancient religious text.
And into grafﬁti? That’s taken
artistvsandow Birk ﬁve years and
counting. ‘

The Andy Warhol Museum
will host the exhibit “The Word

of God: Sandow Birk’s American.

Qur’an” until May 1. It is the ﬁrst
work in a series titled “The Word
of God,” which will exhibit artistic
interpretations of religious texts
created by ﬁve different artists,
eaclf belonging to one of the ﬁve
major world religions: Islam, Ju-
daism, Christianity, Hinduism

and Buddhism.

Birk’s work, reimagines the
Quran — the Islamic holy text —
within modern American society.
The text’s traditional calligraphy
and intricate ink designs, known
as arabesques, are replaced with
graffiti lettering and scenes of
American life. I

Depictions of the Quran can
draw great controversy. Only a
few. years ago, Muslim extremists
in Denmark plotted to assassi-
nate journalists at a newspaper,
Jyllands-Posten, that published

cartoon images of the Prophet.

Muhammad,,an action which is
strictly forbidden by Islamic law.
Birk consciously avoided portray-
ing the prophet in this piece and

removed depictions of Muham-‘ .

mad from other works as a result
of these threats.

To avoid a similar backlash
against the Warhol museum, Tre-
sa Varner, curator of education

Artist pairs American images

for the Warhol Museum, worked
with an advisory committee of
community leaders from each of
the religions represented in “The
Word of God” series.

Among the Islamic delegation
was Luqman Abdus—Salaam, the
director of the Light of the Age
mosque in the North Side. Varner
said the community reaction was
positive, as people understood
that Birk’s exhibit was ‘_‘an art-
ist’s interpretation, not the actual
Qur’an,” and thus not a desecra-
tion of the holy text.

Varner said that of course not
every person could be satisﬁed
with the work. Some raised con-

, cerns that the exhibit was by a

non—Muslim Western artist. But
most understood that Birk’s in-
tent isto show his-personal expe-

rience with the Quran. Part of that V

experience is with the artwork.
, The ﬂowery, decorative callig-
raphy of the Quran was a time-

and Quranic verses

consuming art, especially in the
days before printing presses. Ev-
ery copy of the Quran was lettered
by a scribe who imparted his own
writing style to the chapters. On
his website, Birk describes how
he pays homage to this dedica-
tion by handwriting each surah,
or chapter of the book, in his own
graffiti style.

The Quran has traditionally
been left unillustrated except
for arabesquesalong its borders
because of stigmas against idol
worship. By decorating the Quran

with pictures, Birk is imparting a ‘

new artistic style to the ancient
text. But his methods are not so
new. _ X A ‘

A The Quran is written as the
words of God spoken‘ through the
angel Gabriel to Muhammad. So
the book is a nonlinear work, with
each surah dedicated to a lesson
or idea on which the reader can
meditate. According to his web-

site, Birk reads each surah and
meditates upon its meaning and

_ style. He then transfers the imag-

es in his head to the canvas. This
style of reading draws from tradi-
tional schools of Quran study.
Reading styles vary among
Muslims. Rebecca Denova, a pro-
fessor in the religious studies de-
partment, said in an e—mail that

. along “regional/cultural lines,

[there are] differences of opin-
ion” on the reading of the Quran
and the use of imagery within. For
instance, Youssef Abdelwahab,
a sophomore studying anthro-
pology and a practicing Muslim,

said that he borrows from several

different schools of reading when
he picks up the Quran.
Abdelwahab’s understanding
of written Arabic is limited, so
he reads the Quran in English

when he wants to understand the

literal messages laid out in the
text. When he rereads the Quran

MUSIC COLUMN

Nicki Minaj not first woman in hip-hop

Patrick Wagner
Music Columnist

 

In many cultures of the world, strong taboos ex-
ist concerning who can and can’t play certain
instruments. In some Gypsy cult11res,for example,
women dance and sing while men play chordo—
phones, woodwinds and drums. In these cases,
culture determines musicianship.
Within the realm of Western popular music,
a similar difference seemed to exist in hip—hop
beforefans and critics startedhailingNickiMinaj
as the new matriarch of the genre. Though she’s
graspedthe style ofher male contemporariesatan
unprecedented level— and almost deﬁnedwhat
female MCs can now do with her debut album
Pink Friday —- it’s important to recognize that
women have been contributing to the hip—hop
scene since its inception. I
No one’s ever said thatwomen haven’t rapped
inhip—hop, but it’s always beenamale—dominated
genre —women have most often been associated
with supporting rolls, and perceived misogyny
makes the genre controversial to this day. Minaj’s
great contribution comes inher abilityto interpret
the current modes and styles of genre-leaders like
Jay—Z and herYoungMoneylabel—rr1ateLilWayne

through her decidedly female worldview. In many
ways she broke through hip-hop’s glass ceiling.
In “Moment4Life,” she sings the hookwitha
Rihanna-like intensity overa sample that supple-
ments a rnid-tempo drum break with tinges of

York, shewas bound to pick up other inﬂuences.
Punk rock — the movement Blondie was associ-
ated with — and hip—hop grew up side—by—side
in this environment and, as separate as we tend
to view the genres today, they really ought to be
viewed as parallel eiqaressions of many similar
feelings and ideas. _

Harry and her bandmates made friends with
Fab 5 Freddy, aserninal early MC associatedwith
Grandmaster Flash. When it came time to work
on tracks for their 1980 album Autoamerican,
Blondie developed a song called “Rapture” that

’ included a section of Harry rapping in a distinc-

tively early—1980s style. —
“Rapture” was a huge hit that introduced ava-
riety of audiences to the genre. While The Beastie

Boys were still playing hardcore and Vanilla Ice , .

a multicultural appreciation ofhip—hop.

  l‘Littlerock’ looks at California through a foreigner’s eyes

CMU Film Festival 4 11

Courtesy Cynthia Tam
Mike Ott’s ﬁlm “Littlerock” chronicles the story of ajapanese woman stuck in Littlerock,
Calif., who falls in love with a local and chooses to stay in the area.

in the United States at more than a dozen fes-
tivals and -has won several awards. The ﬁlm,
which was the director’s ﬁrst work in the genre,
has a potential national release planned for
September of this year.

He described the story as “action-driven”
rather than debate- or opinion—driven, using
the stories and voices of people involved in the
movements to tell a larger story. For Melendez,
the ﬁlm isn’t just about the people he followed.
Instead, it’s about a massive rights movement
among the immigrants.

“It’s about the story of these people, who
may be activists or regular citizens, who are
ﬁghting for the rights of the immigrants,” he
said. “So the entire documentary references
that struggle. And there’s no voice— over — it’s
told entirely by people involved.” ,

Melendez spent the ﬁlm—making process
networking and meeting people he could fol-
low to tell the story about immigrants and their
rights in the United States. After following his
subjects for a year and a half, he took time to
carefully put the ﬁlm together.

“It was difficult to get it done,” Melendez,
who spent four years on the 96-minute ﬁlm,
said. “In the beginning, I began in the reces-
sion, and it was so hard to get money for
this.” _

On the other hand, while Melendez spent
years on his project, ‘Mike Ott spent only a

month creating his 84-minute ﬁlm, _and less
than half a year editing it.

A man who “stumbled” into ﬁlmmaking
with no clue about what he wanted to do with
his life after college, Ott created “Littlerock,”
a ﬁctional ﬁlm about two Japanese tourists
stranded in Littlerock, Calif. One of the char-
acters falls in love and moves in with a local,
making herselfat home in the area. The entire
ﬁlm revolves around the characters ﬁnding
ways to communicate without speaking the
same language and dealing with prejudice
against foreigners.

“The initial idea came from traveling
abroad and being in situations where everyone
spoke a different language than me,” Ott said in
an e-mail. “It started making me think about
how daunting it must be when people come to
America and don’t know the language, and how
hard it must be to try and assimilate.”

Ott, however, says the ﬁlm is about much
more than assimilation.

“I think it’s about a lot of things,” he said.
“It’s about how language connects us as well
as divides us, it’s about the American dream
versus the American reality, it’s about examin-
ing America through a foreigner’s eyes.”

Ott also said that the ﬁlm could be about
“young people ﬁnding their way,” making it

~ accessible to students attending the ﬁlm fes-

tival. I

Artist doesn’tshy away I
from controversial issues

American Quran 4 11

in Arabic, he moves, slowly throughthe
verses, enjoying the “aesthetic and tonal
qualities” of the words. Birk’sV work is writ-
ten in English, but his images reﬂect the
contemplative reading that American Mus-
lims like Abdelwahab employ.

Most often, the illustrations are of the
lessons portrayed in modern life. A pas-
sage about‘Noah’s ﬂood is accompanied
by adocked Chinese cargo freighter,--and a
collapsed freeway sits beside a surah about
the great earthquake that marks the. end
of the earth. ‘ , — _'

In addition to Birk’s personal reﬂections
on the Quran, Varner hopes that visitors
can come away with a better appreciation
for the text. With the ﬁery rhetoric sur—
rounding Islam and mosque—building, it is

important for.Americans to understand the ‘

Quran as another Abrahamic text like the
Bible or the Torah, Varner said.

The three texts share much in common,
including the story'of~Noah, and all came
from the same region in a similar span of

Sandow Birk interprets Quranic verses by pairing them with images of daily American
‘ - ' ' life.

"time. “VeggieTales"’land countless other I
portrayals have sought to make the Bible —

accessible in modern American life. By at-
taching common scenes of American life to
the Quran, Varner hopes Birk can make this
text speak to daily experience as well.
Birk doesn’tfocus only on Americans _in
the continental U.S.. Several panels portray
American troops in a desert village, and
one uses an image of the World Trade Cen-
ter burning. Varner explained that these

1 images are not meant to exploit negative

stereotypes or add to the persecution of
Muslims post-Sept. 11, but that they repre-
sent events that have been powerful forces
in the lives of all Americans.

Varner believes that the exhibit might
speak “more to American Muslims than
immigrant Muslims” because the exhibit is
more about the Quran within the terms of
American culture than Islam in general.

The next exhibit in “ The Word of God”
series will be Helene Aylon’s “Liberation of
G-d,” a feminist portrayal of the Torah. I

Lewis, who ran a 4.57 40-yard

more than a 10th of a second off '

his time at the Pro Day, running

at every practice for the ﬁrst threeyears of his

8 college career. Sheaifer was a two—time Eastern

Wrestling League champion in2005 andi2o08 and
All—Americanin2009. He has since graduated and
moved on to be an assistant coach at Clarion.
“Hewas my roommate,”Tomei said. “He really
was one of mybetterfriends. We wouldwork hard
inthe room, but right after, we’d befriends again.
I got to know him right away. We still have a good
relationship. After [Pitt] wrestled against Clarion

he said I pinned his kid [Quintas McCorkle] with '

everything he told _him.not to do.”

In his second season as, a Panther, Tomei
wrestled in 30 matches, placing in ﬁve tourna-
ments including a championship at the Shorty
Hitchcock Memorial Classic. Tomei also wonhis
only two dual meet bouts.

“I decidedIwouldn’tcarewhetherIwon or lost
and just get a chance to wrestle a lot of matches,”
Tomei said. “Itwas abig conﬁdence thingfor me

to go out there in those dual matches and beat
those starters, because notawhole lot ofbackups
would be abletodotha ” ‘

The following season Tomei compiled, a
13-3 record. At the U. S. Open, Tomei took ﬁfth
place, including two key victories over NCAA All-
Americans David Zabriskie oflowa State and Ryan
Gritter of Central Michigan. Zabrislde has since
gone onto beathree—timeAll—American and 2010
National Champion.

“I think he was fortunate to be around some
really good people while he was developin ”
Peters said. “[Matt] Kocher, Keith Gavin, Drew
Headlee were All-Americans so he really got to
watch people in front of him  it.”

In his next competition, Tomei took fourth
place at the World Team Trials, earning him a
spot on Team USA’s freestyle team traveling to
Poland in the summer of 2009. Tomeiwasrft the
only Pantherinwarsaw. Peters, one ofTeam USA’s
two coaches, accompanied him.

“It was probably one of the best experiences
thatacollege lddcanhave,”Tqmei said. “I gotto go

it was great to travel and learn with them.”

What makes a champion? _ 8

We say the Big Dance is unpredictable. With
68 teams in the darn thing, picking a winner
seems best left to a hat and folded up Post-it
notes. -

8 But the tournament has given us a few pat-
terns. .

ANo. 16 seedhas neverbeatenaNo. 1, going
0-104. With that statistic, the bottom-feeders
are out. Boston has a slim chance of hanging
with Kansas in its second-round battle of the
bands, but make whatever hyperbolic bet you’cl
like that the Terriers won’t win ﬁve more.

For that matter, certain conferences have
goose eggs when it comes to Final Four appear-

’ ances since the tournament expanded in 1985.
Onlyahandﬁil of the 31 conferences — or their
prior incarnations — have earned trip to the
Final Four: the six major conferences, the C010-
nial, the Western, the BigWest,the Horizon, the
Atlanﬁc 10 and Conference USA. UNLV made
the Final Four in the Big West but then moved to
the Mountain West, so that conference remains
in it with transfer credits. ’

That eliminates 12 teams from champion-

~.‘,.

ship discussion. Among them: Princeton and
Gonzaga. The Mountain Westtechnicality keeps
Brigham Young and San Diego State in.

Seeding whittles down the thicket of con-
tenders ﬁirther. A team ranked No. 12 orworse
has never made the Final Four, and neither has R
aNo. 7, aNo. 9 oraNo. 10 since the tournament
grew to 64 teams.

That jettisons another 22 programs. Vil-
lanova, Tennessee; Michigan State and UCLA
all bow out here. Better luck in 2012.

Thirty-six states haven’t produced a cham-
pion in the last 30 years. Ohio State, Brigham .
Young, Wisconsin, Texas, West Virginia and
Vanderbilt all say goodbye thanks to that fact.
Villanova’s 1985 championship keeps Pitt
alive. ‘

Where to go from here? The stats show that
all kinds of teams can win. Champions have,
trusted 3-point shooting in some cases, like
Kansas in 2008, and strong reboundingin oth-
ers, such as North Carolina in 2009. '

One useless statistic, though, is steals. As
far back as easy-access Internet statistics go, a
member of the‘top—15 teams in terms of steals
per game has neverwon that year’s tournament.
Perhaps it reﬂects a reckless style of defense, I ‘
don’t know, but I do know that Louisville and

Gray returns to QB position

Thomas, will also practice in a limited capacity
this spring because of injuries.

Graham was also pleased by the perfor-
mance of his quarterbacks, including incum-
bent starter Tino Sunseri, as well as Mark
Myers, Anthony Gonzalez and Kolby Gray.

“The quarterback position really im-

' pressed me today —— how they managed it

and how we threw the football,” Graham said
after practice. ‘

-Sunseri said the quarterbacks started out
well with the new system.

“We were rolling a little bit today, not as fast
as we want to be, but we’re in the right«direc-
tion we believe,” Sunseri said after practice.

Gray, who was recruited to Pitt as a quar-
terback, moved to safety shortly after coming

to the school, but is now back at his original.

position.

“I haven’t thrown in a year and a half and
I’m still kind of getting into the groove of quar-
terback, and I was really excited out there
today. It was like old times in high school,”
Gray said after practice.

Graham also said that on Monday, tight
end Mike Cruz was suspended for a Violation
of team rules and then left the team.

The spring schedule consists of three prac-
tices a week and the annual intrasquad Spring
Game, which will be at Heinz Field April 16
at 2 p.m. I

Free throw shooting separates Duke

Syracuse are somehow doomed by this posi-
tive quality.

In the last 10 years, more than six losses
entering the NCAA Tournament also signals
doom. Sadly, some more Big East programs bid
adieu here, perhaps for the best. Connecticut,
Georgetown and St. John’s all ﬁnally get some
rest.

Eight other teams are out thanks to the Rule
of Six or Less, including Purdue, Kentucky, Ari-
zona and Michigan —— who I’m shocked lasted
this far. .

We’re down to eight contenders from our
original 68: Duke, San Diego State, Pitt, Florida,
Notre Dame, Kansas, North Carolina and George
Mason. Funny enough, that’s two teams from
each region, and four possible Elite Eight match-
ups. We’re on the right track. V

Duke and San Diego State square off in‘a

battle of conference tournament winners. Only
the Blue Devils, though, are among the top—25
scoring teams in the nation — a status each of

the past ﬁve champions has held. The Aztecs A

are 81st. This mid—major falls.

Butwhat about the other mid-major, George
Mason? Somehow the Patriots made it this far
despite a different seed and record from the
famous 2006 Final Four club, whose 27-8 re-
cord, oddly, would have accurately predicted
that they wouldn’t win it all.

Unfortunately, they fall short again, but so
does North Carolina, their Elite Eight opponent.

Both teams lost too many games in Novem-
ber. The past ﬁve champions lost zero games
to unranked opponents in the ﬁrst month of
the season. The Patriots and Tar Heels both
dropped a pair.

Duke, meanwhile, was perfect untiljan. 12.
-It earns a second-consecutive title game ap-
pearance.

Contrary to the belief that rest before the
NCAA Tournament does ateam good, four of the
last ﬁve champions won their conference tour-
nament the year they won the national tourna-
ment. The lone exception, the 2009 Tar Heels,
didn’t playaconference tournamentwinner in
the ﬁnal three rounds. Basically, they weren’t
given the chance to lose.

That mean’s that Pitt, Notre Dame and Flori-
da—also-ransintheir conference tournaments
— are out once they run into Kansas. Only the

Jayhawks endure with Duke. ,

So who wins? Both led their conference in ”

scoring. Both wear blue. Defensively, they are
within a point per game of each other.

It comes down to free-throw shooting, that
rarely discussed but crucial aspect of the game.
Although the teams are mirror images in every-
thing else, Kansas shoots 68 percent from the
_charity snipe. Duke makes 75 percent.

This year, that’s what makes a champion.
Congratulations to the Duke Blue Devils, the
last team standing in the 2011 NCAA Tourna-
ment. I

Careeras wrestling coach
could be in T omei’s future

Tomei 4 16

In 2009, Tomei was ﬁnally able to break into
the Panthers’ startinglineup. Tomei, then ajunior,
took advantage of this opportunity by amassing
a 33-7 record on the season, leading the team to
its ﬁrst EWL team title in history.

“Iwas really excited but kind of nervous going

into the year,” Tomei said. “I was pretty pumped.
When I ﬁrst came here, I was just happy to be on
the wrestling team. After afew years Iwanted to

reallywrestleandbeinthelineup.Duringthatsea— «

son, I was ableto beapartoftheteamtitle. Itwas
one of the best feelings I’ve ever had in my life.”

Attl1eEWLindividual tournamentTomeiwon
allthree ofhis matches onhiswayto anindividual
title after a- pin in the ﬁnals over Brandon Wil-
liamson ofWest Virginia.

Tomeiwas named the toumameﬁts’ outstand-
ing wrestler.

‘ Tomei earned an automatic bid to the NCAA
Championships, where he won his ﬁrst match
of the day over Ziad Haddad of North Carolina.
Tomei lost his next two matches to Mark Ellis of
Missouri and Cameron Wade ofPenn State—both
wrestlers who Tomei has beaten in the past.

“I was ready to go — or at least I thought I
was ready to go — at Nationals,” Tomei said “I
wrestledagoodﬁrst match.Icame uptoEllis and
he’s basically a big lineman, he doesn’t move a
whole lot but he’s strong. Itwas a close 2-1 match,
it didn’t go my way and I was really upset after. I
took it too hard on myself. Iwent on’t0 wrestle
Wade, a guyI’vebeaten several times before, and
I lost that too.”

He added that he’s battled nerves during his
wrestling career, an issue that sometimes costs
himmatches. «

“Thelastmonth or so I’ve reallybeentraining
myselfto get the nerves out,” Tomei said. “I have
been more ableto go out and focus on the matches
and not get stoppedbyrnyhead. Somedays I just
don’t wrestle as myself. I want to always wrestle
my best. The technique is there, I’m athletic, I’m
fast and I’m strong — it’s just my head that’s in
and out. Ifit’s in, there’s a good chance I beat a
lot of guys.” . —

‘ This season, a Tomei win has almost been
takenforgrantedatPitt’s matches, and Tomeihas

   

\\"l .l.;\  (})..\’ ‘r'<f.)I.'l(

won his second EWL individualtitle.

“It reallyhas been nice to have Ryan as an ace
in the pocket heading into the last bout,” Stottle—
myer said. “We have some greatguys here, but if

another team wanted to wrestle one bout for the .

match, he’d be the guy I’d send out.”

. Heading into the NCAA Championships,
Tomei is looking for the chance to make a name
for himself.

“He really is a greatwrestler,” assistant coach
and former All-American wrestler Kocher said.
“He’s gotalotof size, butyou knowtherearesome
big guys thatyou don’tfeel the weight ifthey don’t
know how to use it. With Ryan you really feel that
we’ t.”

Peters agreed that Tomei is a tough athlete to
wrestle against. _

“At this point, we expect Ryan to win every
matc ,” Peters said. “I think he will be an All-
American, but our goal is for him to be the Na-
tional Champion.”

» _ Tomei is currently ranked No. 6 nationally by
InterMat, a leading amateur wrestling website,.
Despite his spot at sixth, Tomei has beaten the
top three ranked wrestlers: No. 1 Zach Rey from
Lehigh, No. zjarod Trice from Central Michigan
and No. 3 Ryan Flores from American.

“You know, I’ve beaten [Rey] before,” Tomei
said. “It wasn’t recently, butl have beaten him. I
have to be smart with him — he’s a big, strong
guythatknows howto gethisway. He’s anice
guy, I’ve got nothing against him, but he needs
to be beaten some time. And Iwant to be the one
that does that.” _

Going forward, Tomei sees himself staying
involved in  after his collegiate career
ends. He’s looking ahead to the Olympic Trials
and to a career as a wrestling coach. Tomei will
graduate from Pitt after majoring in health and
physical activity with a concentration in well~
ness specialization and minoring in ﬁtness. He
has consistently maintained a GPA above a 3.0.
“The bestthingl canthinkoflookingbackis my
friends,” Tomei said. “I’ve met a lot of good guys
here. The coaches and the team have meantalot.
I’m not abig-city person, but I’ve metalot of good
people —— people I’ll know all of my life.” .
