Pittsburgh early next year. The
bank is presently offering 200,000
sharesof common stock to the
general public at $10 per share.

“The thingsthis "man was. saying,

that may uncover serious crimes.
He added, when they donit, the
news media ’doesn’t' criticize them

As an example, Bloice cited the

to visit Dita Beard.

“Here's a guy who worked for the
U.S. Government, for the CIA,

The fraternity system in this

‘ _’.seven lean years. This year there
i. was a startling increase in the
 V number of bids received, 128 as of
September 28, opposed to a total of
147 last year for the entire
. September through April season.
.. There has been an equivalent
increase in the registrations at

CMU and at Penn State’s main.

campus, indicating a large trend in
a return to fraternity life.

Dina Natali, co-cordinator of the

fraternity system at Pitt is not

surprised. “The reason is that the

"fraternity men have gone out to the

freshman student body. lt’s due to

' thepersonal, man to man contact of

I the fraternity brothers.”

Inter-fraternity Council (IFC

President Jay Latterman, says the

freshman class is realizing the

1 '. fraternities offer something more

 . than dorm life. He admits that the

fraternities had to re-deﬁne them-

selves, but have done so success-
fully-

,_ Latterman sees the upsurge as

‘due to, “the attitudes of. fratemi-

ties on this campus,,a_r_nore low key

and friendly atmosphere. The new
philosophy here is to first make a
man your friend...and then your
brother.” 4 /

Both Natali and Latterman cite
the greater independence and
sophistication of freshmen students

as the catalyst behind the new‘

fraternity image. They noted that
freshmen want more than just a
comfortable_ social atmosphere, and
that the community-action oriented
fraternities offer the alternative.

Natali sees this sudden increase
in bids at Pitt as a force for the
strengthening of. the fraternity
system in this college. Latterman,
however, noted that most public
feelings have cycles, and feels the
increase might be just that and
nothing more. A

 Analysis

Univ. Policymaking  

BY
N..l.BROWN
AND
SCOTT MACLEOD

On the 24th floor of the
Cathedral of Learning, Vice-
Chancellor of Operations Joseph
Dutton makes decisions that affect
the daily lives of Pitt students.

Last week, two of those decisions
were reached during meetings at
Dutton’s large oval conference
table with leaders from Student
Government and Black Action
Society.

Thefirst meeting last Monday
sought solutions to the add-drop
fee proposal. It was decided there
would be no fee, but instead they
would seek an improved method of
dispensing course information
prior to registration. 1.

On Thursday Student Govern-
ment lobbied with Dutton in an

effort to cancel the proposed 25
cent fee on time schedules,
ﬁnal result was there will not be a
fee for winter term, but the action
will be put into effect for next fall
term.

So it appears that these solutions
are victories for the students.
However, it" is important to
understand how these V decisions
were reached.

The Administration's apparent
goal was to institute these fees for
the coming winter term. But they
ran into difficulties when the
students arrived back in Oakland in
September.

It seems that once again the-

Administration did not seek stu-
dent input when these proposals
were being manufactured, and
Student Government was not very
happy with the end results ‘of those
proposals. 1

Dutton during the Monday meet-
ing: Would it not have taken
merely a phone call in the summer
when the ideas were in the making
to get Student Government in-
volved? Why wait until September
when there is a conﬂict because of
student resistance? ~

When Dutton’s office was
confronted with the problem of the
waste and abuse in the add-drop
process, their means of correcting
the matter proved perhaps too
practical for the circumstances.

Their solution to the problem
was to attack the effect, rather than
the cause of the abuse. They
forced the problem on the students,
attempting‘ to charge them $5 every
time they wanted to add ‘or drop a
course.

Obviously this would be a
solution. To attack the ‘problem of

.the add‘-drop abuse by charging

money would easily be a deterrent.
But is this the way to attack the

Perhaps Ira Dichter of the

Student Government Allocationsl

Committee had a better solution
when he said at the meeting that

the cause of the problem should be ~

analyzed and not the effect.

The cause of this problem was
not getting adequate information to
students before they register. He
said if they had the information,
they wouldn’t need to abuse the
add-drop process.

Apparently, Dutton thought so
because in the fall, hopefull there
will be a combination information
book. It will include, if it is ever’
constructed, the time schedule, an
improved course description, and
an improved faculty evaluation
section. ' I ‘

When you're young. and you go
wrong in this City. you get put on_
probation. For one hour a month,
maybe. you meet with the
caseworker who is supposed to set
you straight. You might be one of
65 in his Caseload -- he can try with
what time he has. lf you go wrong
again no one is very surprised.‘

That’s the system for probation in
Pittsburgh. Maybe not what it was

meant to be, but just the way it has .
' worked out; kids on probation,

policed by harried caseworkers who
have to split their time among
40-60 kids.

But a couple of guys are out to
change the system. Randy
Metusak and his co-worker. Bob
Reitz. along with the YMCA. are
running Project Probation.

Metusak and Reitz are both Pitt
alumni who work with the
probation system in the juvenile
courts. ‘When they decided to
change things, they came to the
YMCA. and the students of Pitt.

Actually the project is not new. A

pilot program was run earlier this’
 year in March. Starting with 35

volunteers, they screened to six
actual workers, who were then
assignedliids on probation.

Two volunteers dropped out of the
program. but results with the
remaining four were good ‘enough
to warrant starting theprogram

, again.

_ kids

 

The basic idea behind theiproject.
Metusak says. is ,“To show these
an alternative to their
lifestyle...to meet with them on
their own ground."

The program uses only volun-‘

teers, who work with kids in the
first stages
pattern. The workers try to
develop a. relationship with the
youth they are assigned, to be
available in emergencies or during
personal crises. - _

Animation Workshop 2

. i


‘Early in 1973 Robert Brcer won the eleventh
‘ Independent Film Award for “his unique. con- .
tribution to the language of cinema in the‘e:1:-._
ploration of the thresholds of rapid montage.”
From Monda.y, October 1 to Wednesday, October

' 5’ Brccr will be in Pittsburgh to conduct a work-
shop in the essentials of animation. H c will “de- '
mystify” the whole process of single-frame ani-
mation by first showing a series of films to sup-
ply students with an historical background, and
second, by guiding and working with students
as they make films during the course_’of the
workshop. Breer will emphasize the _“simplest,
frcest, and most incatpcnsiiie methods of animat-
my film images.” The workshop is aimed at be_-
ginners but? is so structured that advanced ani-

" mators can pursue their own projects within the
format of the meetings. The class will meet each
eiicning from 7 :30 to 10:30 p_.m. at the.Film

  To’ The Editor: A _
 If there is anything at Pitt that
. ,_. doesn’t need a Major change, it is
_7‘- Q the Pitt Band.” As manv have
wethered the fortunes of the
Panther football team rise and fall
 over the past several years, one
 thing has remained constant, the
' unparallelled performance of the
band. Its proud tradition of
excellence has never wavered
throughout its fine 62 year history
. Spirit is'an important element or
V any’ football program, and this
‘ _ spirit has never been lacking in the
V 'A band. ' We help the cheerleaders at
_, .__,pep rallies by playing music and
 throughout the campus-, inciting
'" spirit and enthusiasm as we move.
Uiilike many other bands, we get
. psyched before a_ performance.
V — _While in the hole before pregame,

/we sing school songs, and cheer the _

, Panthers on. The excitement
builds as the Herald Trumpets
, play the traditional fanefare, which
is followed immediately, by the
thunder of drum rolls. This
culminates in an explosion of
energy as the llunu uuxacb‘ nu...
onto -the field, high-stepping and
cheering as we go.
A Next comes a host of school songs.
Fist we play the Pitt “Victory

—T_It doesn’t really matter all that much. Hardly any

' of us live outside anymore; we liveand work and play
andjstuldy in fairly snug buildings. The only time the \

halftime. ,We would end up with
th,6 Same show every week. Our
shows are meant to entertain the
crowd. They incorporate contem-
porary arrangements with original
formations. A simple show of
school songs would turn many

people -off, especially at ‘away/’

Such shows are better left for_

Baillie’s comment concerning our
uniforms is totally without founda-
tion. Providing a sharp appear-
ance, they are anything but dull.
other bands,-"including Ohio State
wear similar uniforms, besides, the
crossbelts have long been tradi-
tional at Pitt. I guess that we could
wear penguine , suits like Penn
State’s, or blue jeans and T-shirts
like Stanford. .

A final item that I will comment on
is Baillie’s comparison of the Pitt

‘ Band to other universitv bands. In

judging a band’s performance, you
should look at its style and quality.
Last year we visited Notre Dame.’
Their band was amazed by our
discipline and organization. They

wondered how we could put a snow‘
together on four hours practice per‘
1 week when they practice for twelve

hours or more. It was also

remarked that they always come to —

Pitt with their team just to see us
march. '

Similarly, when Syracuse was last
in Pitt Stadium, some of their

band’s members were heard‘ to say
that they wished that they were in

May I suggest for the

Aside from the above matt_er,‘_

Last week I was told that my
weekly Pitt News columns are very
negative, yea, even depressing.
The young lady who made ﬁle
remark claimed.tha my~ constant
criticism turned people off to a
considerable degree.

She contended that I would have
every institution on campus des-
troyed, discredited, or disbanded,
if such were in my power.

This miss even went so far as to
say that people who read my
material hope they never meet me.

Egad. . V E

My reaction at the time was
mixed, especially since I discover-

edwithout doubt that my opinions.

are taking ‘their toll on my social
life. _ .

Still, after-a ‘great deal of thought
on the subject, my real. reaction
was indeed no reaction at all. In
spite of all the hardships I have
heaped upon myself, I feel the
same as I always have.

What is thereto be positive
about?

Besides, ask yourself the quest-
ion: “When was the last time I

read an interesting article about‘

something good?” Speaking for
myself. war. tempest, and hardship
are among the most fascinating of
topics. ’ -

I was recently. encouraged to hold

.my traditional ‘beliefs when I

received_ a letter from a friend in a
far-off institution of higher learn-
ing. Perhaps you.’-ll recall that in
March of this year I wrote of this
very same fell/ow, one Irvis Jarvis
Bartowaik, “Wacky” to his friends

‘ - and enemies.
I. To refresh your memory, Wacky

was quite elated when he wrote me
at that time, due to some

‘ signiﬁcant events in his life.

’ Wacky, who attends the Ernest

»-Nubile College of Business Theat-

rics,' was. particularly happy
because first, his home team had

P just imported Remus Panacea to

lead it to glory; I and secondly,
because my friend was personally

‘accepted into an organization

called Alabama Gamma.

Well, disillusionment. has set in,
and the lad is about as negative
towards -life as I am- I reprint here
an excerpt from his letter":

“Dear George, , . -

. ..“Life is a bowl of rocks."

“No longer will I waste my time
’ supporting the home team. Nubile
U. goes and pays Remus Panacea
1.5 hundred hard-earned‘ Yankee
dollars to come here, and lead the

home team on. Well, Panaceads no‘

"panacea", and he’s not going to "lead
me on any more. i ’

* “When, in the opening game,
the home_ team lost 11-0, I began to
fear thatllhu-mblers were not just a_
score but also a prediction for the
season. Sure enough, I in the
second -game against St. Bean-

‘wic‘k’s, the home team took another“-

step toward an 11-0 season with a
crushing 98-0 loss. ' .
“Coach Panacea was mildly upse
about the whole affair, and
subsequently made the entire team
apologize to the very ugly crowd in
attendance. In addition, he made
all jocks go without a shower for
two weeks afterwards, although

this punishment did have the

benefit of discouraging further
crowds. .

“But enough of this. I also gave
up on Alabama Gamma. mainly

because I realized only too late that '

I was not super‘-masculine enough.
“AG is just chock-full of guys
who have such exploits that I can
nevffr’ hope to match them. For
«example. there's Jebson Smoothe.
who works in a local gas station as a

jack, lifting cars and removing lug 1

nuts with his bare fingers.

“Every night after work, Jeb
flexes his‘ way into the AG house,
telling story after story of girls who
pulled into the gas station just to
proposition him, or atleast to give
his biceps a tug. . 4

“Then he gets tanked ‘up and
eats the beer bottles-, and heads out
on the town to see how he’ll make
out. Who am I to associate with the
likes of Jebson Smoothe?

“And so now, l’ve "begun to
believe that there is nothing in life
to be cheerful about, and I find
I more and more to“’ su
belief. .. ~ ppm my

-“Like the other day, when I '
spotted this chick who was really
the cat’s meow. ,I followed her all
over campus, hoping she would

    Lifellsa Bowl of Rocks

begin the latest_episode of “Man- ‘

hunt” when 11 was near.
“I didn't suspect anything when

she began cracking walnuts with '

her" cuticles, but once she turned
around, I noticed a button she was
wearing which said’, ‘MAN FOR
BREAKFAST!‘ .

“So. that’s all for now about
“,eg3tiVity- Right now I’m going to
the Appleby-Crunwaith All-Slavic
Circus, in hopes-that the clowns
there are funnier than the ones I
must live with every day...”

With this, my friend Wacky
signed off. I can add no more about
my less-than-cheerful writings,
except to repeat the openingline of
the letter. ' '

   Roy Buc  Lives 

BY JIM MALONY
Sometimes a performer’s reputa-
tion races far aheadof the actual

— performance. and the artist is

‘ challenged to live up to that
reputation with each appearance.
The result is that an audience is
often. disappointed with people who
somehow don't fill —the shoes
they’re reputed" to own.’ Roy
Buchanan has quite a reputation...
obscure guitar wizard, paid dues
with Rock, C&W, R&B Bands,
turned down lucrative ‘offers to ipin
Rolling Stones, John Lennon..some
rumor p‘erhap_s,.but a compelling

reputation nevertheless. When he -

first appeared at the Syria Mosque
two years ago, he certainly
, disappointed no one. Friday night.
he returned--‘and proved every’ bit

as dazzling as a"legend'should be.-

The Rhythm Kings ‘opened the
show with a tight rocker‘that
started a few feet tappin’. But the
audience soon lost interest. As-
most supporting acts, they faced
the tough task of warming a

‘restless, audience. impatiently ,'a- '

waiting the star. >

‘What began‘ as an -exciting
treatment of Johnny Otis’ "1958
classic “Willie and the Hand
Jive," turned sour when the band.

insisted on extending the song into‘ .

a frenzied jam withblaring sax and

percussion.‘ This tune, was simply ,

  

‘not meant to be overworkedin thi’s~ .

fashion.

Enter the man. Roy and hi_s band‘ i

opened with the old blues standard
“See See Rider," and he wasted no
time putt_ing the crowd under his
musical spell. The second number
was “Johnny B. Goode"-4 \a
showpeice ‘»for any guitarist--and. it

gave a fine indication of what was 

to come. The audience immed-
iately warmed to Roy's distinctive

'_'guitar playing, and "even to those

who didn’t know a fret from a
Fender. it was clear that he was
something else altogether.

One of the-.showfs high points

came when" Roy steppedto the

mike to introduce a tribute to the
man he called “The greatest
guitar player who ever lived"--the

‘late Jimi Hendrix.‘ Withthat, he

moved: into a haunting version of
T‘Hey Joe.”_' The crowd rose in

A applause--ears and ~ eyes V straining
to follow the rapid-ﬁre guitar runs
that ‘would _h_avemade “The Great ~

One" smile. ' ‘ g t V
In the past. Roy has been critized

for having very limited_ vocalﬂ

abilities. However, .1 didn’t ﬁnd
this a drawback Friday night._ Roy
"knows" his range. and.us_ually has
the sense to stay-withirrit Perhaps
a good vocalist would give the band
a wider" range oflmaterial. but Roy

manages .to communiate~.__veryW

lMass transit in the Pittsburgh
area has been the subject of a lot pf
‘-talk but very little ‘action. The
*_County’s Port Authority Transit
-j(PAT), however, is engaged in one
 project designed to improve mass
‘transit by refurbishing and re-
‘building the trolleys.
 The original trolleys in Pittsburgh
_;_ were. horsedrawn. The first
5 horsedrawn line began in 1859,
_ ,5 running from downtown along
.- Penn Avenue to Thirty-F/ourth
‘P’ Street in Lawrenceville. The first

experimental electric trolley line
began in 1888 along Federal Street

to Observatory Hill in the North,

Side,’ while the first permanent
electric line started in March, 1890
along Second Avenue downtown to
Glenwood.

In the early days, trolleys came in
different sizes and shapes. many of
the older trolleys were double-end-
ers, which had a driver’s- seat on
both ends. When the trolley
reached the end of a single tracked
line without a loop, the meterman
merely walked to the controls at the

 

 

 

rear of the car which then became
the front.

There were also luxury trolleys of S A

club cars, with lounge chairs and
fu‘rniture__ which a group could
charter for a trip. Local frieghts
was even carried by special trolleys
before the days of the pickup truck.

Each transit Company originally
submitted its own design to the
manufacturer, resulting in a variety
of vehicles. But in 1935, transit
company presidents met and
decided to standardize trolley
design. The new ‘vehicle was
named the Presidents’ Conference
Committee (PCC) car, and the first
99 built went to Brooklyn. The one
hundredth came to Pittsburgh.
Streetcars of the PCC design and
its later modifications are the ones
still used in Pittsburgh and other
major cities.

During the heyday of trolleys in

the 1930's, Pittsburgh had a fleet of -

1100‘ streetcars. Since 1951, no
trolleys have been manufactured in
the U.S., although recently plans

_have been made to manufacture

more .

Often a transit company would_

build an amusement park along an
unprofitable line to stimulate
business. Kennywood Park in
West Mifflin began as such a
trolley park, built by the Mononga-
hela Street Railroad in 1898. In
Oakland, there ‘ was Luna Park,
located at the present intersection
of North Craig Street and Baum
Boulevard. "The‘ only present

reminder of that park is the Luna

Bar at the corner of North Craig
and Centga Avenue. Other former
trolley parks were Oakwood Park in

McKeesport.

T_0d,ay. PAT owns 95 trolleys
which runon four regular lines and
one rush hour route in the South
Hills area. Many other U.S. cities
still operate trolleys and it appears
that electrically-run streetcars may
be making a comback.

Partial Meal Plan

 

New Meal Plan Wins Approval

BY MITCH BERRY

The partial meal plan program.
newly instituted in the Towers
cafeteria. seems to have won the
approval of the students partici-
pating in it.

In an interview recently with
several dozen meal ticket holders,
some less-than-candid reactions
suggested that Szabo Food Service

,-,-;.and the University Housing Office

have made a good move toward
fulﬁlling the nutritional needs of
the students.

' Sophomore. Molly Newman, best

summed up student reaction to the
partial meal plan saying, “It’s a
very good idea...the best possible
plan. No one is forced to eat all of
the meals."

However. further comments re-
vealed that the students felt that
the meals are lacking in quality and
that they differ substantially.

Breakfast, it was generally a-
greed, is the best meal, and it was
also judged as being the most

, nutritional.

.-*7“ .
5'». Lunch, however, was considered

to be only_average in quality.
Many students cited the lack of
variety in the menu as the main
problem. They also said pizza and
hamburgers were monotonous
menu items.

. The quality of the dinner meals "

was generally regarded as being
poor. ' _ ‘

The interview also drew more
specific comments concerning the

. quality and variety of the individual

cafeteria meals.
“The food’s pretty bad,” com-

7  plained one student. “I have yet to

have a satisfactory meal.”

Another student suggested.
“Maybe if they'd stick to the same
things we'd have better food-less
variety-but better food."

Other comments were:

“Chicken seems to
popular."

“The food has too much starch.
You feel like you’re full, but you’re
not getting a balanced meal.”

“There are too many fried foods
and not enough fresh fruits. meats
and cheeses."

“Food’s the same as last year."

Concerning the service and
personnel in -the cafeterias, stu-
dents were lessoutspoken. Most,
however, felt that it was satisfac-
tory.

One student, however, remarked,

be very

“I hate all those s.o.b.’s behind theg

counter...bitchy as hell.” Marcie
Dobkin, a freshman, disagreed,
“I’ve worked in a cafeteria; I know
what it’s like on the other side.”
Other complaints and suggestions
were made concerning food and
service in the Tower cafeterias.
“The ‘hours are all wrong for
dinner. Six o’clock is too early to
closefor dinner. It would be nice if
they could ﬁgure some way to have
meals running all day long."
“What happened to steaks? I
heard it was going to every other
week.”
“I’m Jewish and they have pork at
least three times a week. I think
there should be more considera-

tion.”
_“The cafeteria doesn't have a
good dietary plan. I don’t think
students can have a balanced meal
plan." A

Senior. Debbie___Singer,___com-_
plained about the sick tray
situation. .“Students— who are on
liquid diets will need something of
substance, too. I think the
situation of giving just liquids is
very bad. If a person is ill, that’s

when they need something of"

nutritional value the most.”
Furthermore, she added, “The
procedure for getting a sick tray is
too Complicated.”

Freshman, Karol Bowser, a-
greed. “Freshmen shouldn’t have
a full meal plan.” She added the
partial meal plan appealed to her.
“It gives you a chance to go out and
eat other foof." “ ,; 
meal plan appealed to her. “It
gives you a chance to go out and eat

other food." 7

However, Dick Dearden, Direc-
tor of the Towers’ food service, was
’unable to react to the new meal
plan situation at present. .
Asked whether the new plan was
working, Dearden replied, “It’s
hard to tell. With the 19 meal plan
we offered to everyone last year we
always knew where we stood. But
with our present set-up...it’s-
difficult to forecast the outcome
yet. We’re just looking for a
pattern.”

' BY HARRIS LEVY
Bernard Malamud, the author of
six novels, has as his latest book,
his third collection of stories.Rem-
brand't's l-lat will be welcomed by
readers ‘familiar with Malamud’s
other books, which include The
Assistant and The Fixer. for
Rembrandt’s Hat, like most of it’s
predecessors is a.-fine book.‘ The .l
collection which contains fewer but
occasionally lengthier stories than
The Magic Barrel and Idiot's First, ‘
although’ marred by flaws ~ not a
present in those earlier work,
surpasses them in‘ many ways.“
The book‘s,eight stories deal with
familiar‘ Malamud themes and
subjects: death, old age. failure
His characters, often
American and Jewish are portrayed
with Malamud’s rare understand»
ing and care.- Thestories are more
adventurous in style than their

predecessors. but'3 this is not
. necessarily to their advantage.
The» first story ‘.‘The Silver

Crown” is a _mixture of fantasy and
reality present in“‘previous stories.
Gans, a‘ high school". biology

 teacher and a "'very skepticalhman , ‘

actual existence. Gans’. skepticism
outlasts, his patience; he losses f
faith inthe crown, his father dies.

. This brief summary cannot begin to"

do justice to this story. ltis typical
of Malamud’s work in"it’s lack of '

      

story serves the themes and ideas
and not, as in the case of showy and
merely clever authors, the author’s
need to show off. Malamud
impresses usrnot with verbiage but
with understanding.

“ln Retirement" about a retired
man's hopeless desire for a young
woman. like “The Silver Crown"
deals in familiar waysiwith familiar

‘themes to Malamud Readers but is

at least as good as earlier stories on
these themes. ' ' . A

The collection’s longest story, the
66 page ‘fMan in the Drawer”
poses a fascinating ‘situation: A A’
widowed, Jewish American writer
is askedby a Russian, a complete
stranger to. him, an author and cab
driver to smuggle some stories out
of Russia for publication. The story
raises many questions ‘on artistic
freedom. and the difficult situation

of Russian Jews, and describes the

American’s feelings and problems
as well". The most miraculous part
ofithegstory is its end_i_n_g where

’ synopses of four of" the Russians’s

stories are presented. They sound

like lMalamu.d stories,. the reader‘
might say, but they are wonderful

and better in some ways than ‘the

- somewhat rambling story in which

they are contained. ,‘‘Man in the

“My Son the Murderer.” _ The
story’ of ‘a father’s inability to

enhances the story by being at once‘
direct and unspecific [trivial details
are not filled in-they would detract
‘from, the story’s impact and
universality.] ' 
“Talking Horse“ is Malamud at} 
his most fantastical. It ‘is aboutlgr’ C
Abramowitz. a talking horse?
striving to understand “the nature
of his fate." Is he “a man in a
horse or ahorse that talks like a J
man?". Abramowitz' unlikely

EVANSTON, Ill.--Somebody forgot to turn off a sprinkler‘ system
called Lake Michigan here Saturday, and as a result, a light rain fell’
throughout the afternoon at archaic Dyche Stadium. Theonly thing left '
undampened was the spirit of the soggy but jubilant Pitt football team,
which splashed its way to its first victory of the season, and first at Pitt
for new head coach Johnny Majors.

Although it took great effort from the entire squad to ‘pull off a

victory, it was the work of one that shined above everything else. That
one person was Tony Dorsett, and in his third varsity game, he
shattered a rushing record set 43 years ago. Dorsett carried the ball 38
times for 265 yards, eclipsirig the mark Warren Heller set in a game
against Penn State in 1930, when he picked up 200 yards. V
is Billie Daniels. again performed admirably at quarterback, running
well and completing five of 14 passes under less than admirable
"circumstances. Similar to the Georgia game, Daniels had two passes
intercepted after they hit Panther receivers. . Similar to the Baylor
gamé‘, manylpasses were dropped by Cat pass-catchers, although the
wetness of the football was a contributing factor here. -

The big question mark was on the injury-riddled Pitt defense. The
top two middleguards, Gary Burley and Don Parish, did not make '?the
trip, and neither did starting linebacker Kelcy Daviston. The Wildcats
were eager to see if they could run through Pitt the way Baylor did, and

.they found_out all too soon. r r ’

Pitt won the toss but elected to kick off, choosing to have the stiff
wind behind its back, and hopeful of leaving Northwestern in the hole.

' Northwestern moved the ball for a while,'but on its first third.down,
was stopped. The newcomers and healthy starters had indeed taken up
the slack for their fallen comrads. . a

‘Freshman Cecil Johnson ﬁlled in at middleguard very "well, and
Frosh Arnie Weatherington played linebacker superbly, leading all Pitt
defenders with solo tackles, and ten assists. . — ‘

“Johnsonand Weathefington played very well,” said defensive
coordinator Jackie Sherrill, a man who doesn’t compliment players too
freely. “Our ends also made a great improvement over last week.
(Tom) Perko and (Jim) Buckmon played much better.” ,

With Gary Burley not around to keep Northwestern quarterback
Mitch" Anderson company, the honors went to Perko. .The 215-pound
sophmore sacked Anderson four times, and tackled him on running
plays several ‘times also; Perko caused a key fourth-quarter fumble-
that stopped _a Wildcat drive. . ,

' The defense by no ‘means played a perfect game. Any player that
thinks he did will be shown the falacies of his thinking in the films by
Sherrill, The Wildcats’ second touchdown. option keeper by
Anderson, was the direct result of a‘ ‘missed assignment.

“We knew we had to shut them out in the second half, and that’s
what we did,” said a relieved Jim Dyar, interior line coach. Glen Hyde
played a real fine game andDave J ancisin had a great second half after
a poor first one.” _ 7

A pleased Johnny Majors admitted that it felt very good to get that
first win under his belt. “We really needed this win for our players and

reminded, “Too many people want ’to—"breath easy after the first win.

Having just witnessed a 265-yard
performance —by a freshman tail-
back. Pitt defensive line coach Jim
Dyar made it clear that he hadn't
seen a performance like it in many
years. ‘

The highlights of Dorsett's runs
were ‘his twoiscoring efforts. In the
second quarter. with the score tied
at 7-7. Dorsett spun through the
center of the Northwestern line.
refusing to be tackled until he was
in the endzone. With the score tied
in the third quarter. Pitt took over
on its own 20-yard.line following a
punt‘ which landed in "the endzone.
Dorsett swept around left end for
one yard. and on the next play. was
off for 79 yards and a touchdown.

The wetness of the field and of
the tacklers target. Dorsett. wasn't
the only reason that he had
one of the tinest performances in
NCAA history. “I just kept on
pushin." explained a relaxed
Dorsett after the game. “Last
week against Baylor I kept getting
tripped up by somebody lying on
the ground. and I was determined
not to let. that happen again."

Dorsett had a feeling that this
would be the game that he would
excell in. “I had a feeling when we
were watching the films that it was

v. going to be my day,” Dorsett

admitted.

Dorsett almost scored on a pass
play. but caught a Daniels’ pass out
of bounds in the third quarter. “I
had a full head of speed. and the
defender is backtracking. if I catch
that pass. I'm gone." said Dorsett.

showed why in his 79-yard jaunt.
Dorsett had broken into the clear
by the 40-yard line. “I never look
back, but I saw this one dude
comin’ out of the corner of my eye,
he said with a grin. “I just turned
it on and beat him.”

Johnny Majors was bubing over
with praise for Dorsett. “It was the
most fantastic performance I've
seen ‘in 17 years of college
football." he said. “Dorsett is
more poised than any sophomore
I've ever seen. He_ had good
blocking. but a lot of times’ he made
his own daylight."

Backtield coach I-Iarry Jones.

I having just seen Dorsett gain more

yards in one game than he did_’in
five years in the NFL, merely
drawled. “He -wasn't bad."
Actually. Jones was as happy as
anybody about it. “What
impressed me was that he carried
the ball 38 times. but was just as
strong in the fourth quarter as he
was in the first." he said.

the Pitt one-season record of 964
yards, set by Tony Uansa in 1929,
will be broken by Dorsett, who is
more than half-way there in just
three games. The record of 265

it could and probably will be broken

during the game.

' A S000-piece assemblage of high

was canceled due to the rain...
Northwestern installed Tartan Turf
on its field this year, and it’s

first was given to Majors, then one
to Dorsett, and then a third to

BY RICK SHRUM

Shortly after Satu_rday’~s Pitt-
Kent State cross-country meet; the
skies opened and released buckets
of tears on Schenley Park. Not
rain, but tears--as the heavens
were paying their last respectsto
the late Kent State team, which
suffered a painful and instantan-
eous death only a few moments
before.

The Cats silenced any skeptics of
the California win with an
impressive 25-30 victory over the
tough Golden Flashes. With the
season only two weeks old, Pitt is
2-0., and appears headed for a fine
season. ,

“I was pleased with our overall
performance today,” said Pitt head
coach Jim Banner. ‘‘_I felt that the
entire team improved over last
week’s showing. We ran a mile_
more (6 ‘A miles) than we did at

California, and still finished with
good times.”

Nick Martin was one Panther that
didn’t finish with a good time--he
finished with a great time. Martin
led the field wit a 32:22 clocking--a"
time not usually recorded on a wet
course early in the season.

Pitt’s Bob Steele ﬁnished third in
the meet, but it was a balanced
team effort that once again brought

.home the bacon. Although Kent’s-

one-two punch of,Mike Ehrman
and Bill Kirk finished secondand
fourth, it was the CatsT domination
of six of the first eight places that
told the story. No other Keﬁt
runner could finish better than
ninth.

Although Banner admitted his
pleasiure over the result, _he still

‘had some reservations about his .

team’s showing.

“I was pleased with our overall
effort, but not with all the boys. I
know some of them can improve,

least outwardly, and the plane
continued to ascend” The pilot then
informed the team that he was
proceeding to Detroit at -reduced
speed, explaining that Eastern has
no service facilities in Pittsburgh.
After a 30-minute stop in Detroit,
the problem was corrected, and the
plane went on to Chicago’s O’Hare
‘International Airport without fur-
ther incident. O’Hare had been
closed earlier in the day due to fog,
and if the plane had been on time,
it would have been stacked up with
the backlog of incoming ﬂights.

In Irl,tr(t_mur(tl   Play

BY RICK SHRUM

With the intramural softball
season nearing a close, many
league title races remain‘ up for
grabs. Several league flights could
finish tied. and would interfere
with the proposed October 3
opening of playoffs.

Such a deadlock appears

‘imminent in the tough Graduate-

Faculty League's first flight,. as the
Gonads surprised previously un-
beaten Spotwelds, -5-2. last
Thursday evening, to move into a
first-place tie with them.

‘The Spotwelds appeared to be on
their way to their third straight
win, as lead-off hitter D. Jones

"opened the game with a home run.

However, that-lead lasted only an
inning, as the Gonads. pushed two
runs across the plate in the bottom
of the secondf Dan Brooks and
Dave Clark came through with
back-to-back doubles for one run,

and Clark scored on a ground out.
by Frank Altman for the other.

That 2.1 lead held till the sixth,
when the Gonads scored their
winning runs. Ed Jozwiak, John

» Shomard, and George Vasilahis

contributed two runs with consecu-
tive doubles. Vasilahis was thrown
out when he tried to stretch his hit
into atriple, but Brooks followed

‘with a home run.
‘ ’ The ‘way the playoffs are set up,

two'teams from this flight will go

into the ‘Playoffs. ~"The Gonads and-.
