This Trimester

Student Union activities will
continue during the spring tri-
mester despite the fewer number
of students attending school full-
time in this period. The program
schedule has been slowed down
slightlyto match student attend-
ance.

Four Midday performances are
deﬁnitely committed for the sum-
mer months. Leading the list is
the appearance of ,_the Pittsburgh
Symphony String Quartet on May
24. Their featured work will be
Haydn’s Emperor Quartet,” from
which the Alma Mater is taken.

Next will come Pulitzer Prize
winning poet W. D. Snodgrass on

‘June 14. He will do readings and

comments on poetry, and discuss
his own works.

On July 12 artist Grant Rey-
, nard will deliver an ilustrated
lecture on Modern art. The Uni-
versitylst own Antiqua Players,
led by Colin Sterne, will be
playing at a Midday program,
but no date has been scheduled
for their appearance yet.

Four movies will alternate with
the Midday Series at the Wednes-
day noon hour period. The movies
will be comedies featuring the
noted comedians of our time, and
including Alec Guiness and Fer-
nandel. ‘

According to=the director of the
Student Union, William H. Coop-
er, the series of Midday speakers
could extend to six lectures. “We
can move in more programs, it we
can ﬁnd an audience.”

No Friday night dances have
been scheduled. Student Di-
rector Sheila Rinney is looking
for a dance committee chair-'
man. If interest is shown,
dances will be added to the
schedule.

Game facilities for takraw,
shuffleboard, ping pong, etc., are
available, and their use is en-
couraged in this trimester.

Stephen Foster Memorial-
“The Lesson,” according to Ko-

pac, is “an avant guarde, exper-

satirizes education.” The three
main characters in the play are a
professor, his pupil, and a maid.

_. Scheduled for June

The play is scheduled for June
13, 15, and 16 at noon in the Stu-
dentﬁlnion Ballroom. Also an 8:30
performance will be given on June
17.

“So far we don’t have any
parts past, so anyone is welcome
to try out. ‘The Lesson’ should
be a lot of fun because it is
quite different. It’s much like
‘Time of Your Life’ but more
avant guarde,” Kopae said.

McHale’s play “Everyman” was
written by an anonymous author
and will be produced with the co-
operation of the Antiqua Players
and the Heinz Chapel Choir.

“Medieval Allegory”

“Everyman” will be shown on
the lawn between the Cathedral
of Learning and Heinz Chapel on
June 8 and as an outdoor spec-
tacle before the Pittsburgh Arts
Festival at Gateway Center on
June 6.

Describing the play, Mcllale
said that “it is a medieval alle-
gory in which God sends death
to summon ‘everyrnan’ for a
reckoning of his account with
God.

“We have parts for 30 persons
so anyone interested in acting, re-
gardless of his previous experi-
ence, should come to the Mem-
orial or stop at our office, 306

Gregory Kopac, director of Eugene Ionesko’s “The Les-

Final Report on

ﬁnal report to Philip H. Pow-

Powers explained that formulat-

the completion of the investiga-

the report to the Chancellor would
be ready by the middle of April.

In fact, he said that he wrote
to Rep. John T. Walsh. Demo-

1, telling him that the report
would not be ﬁnished at that
time since new information had
been discovered by the commit-

Press Award

The Pitt News scored highest
in the annual Associated Colleg-
iate Press competition for college
newspapers for the winter term,
1960, with an All-American
Award. It was one of ﬁve college
papers throughout the United
States to receive such an honor
in the bi—weekly classiﬁcation.

This is the second consecutive
term that the paper hasplaced in
the top category.

It was judged in comparison

other colleges with undergradu-

ate enrollments of 4000 or more,

with similar methods of publica- ‘
tion, and with the same fre-
quency of issues per term.

‘For the past two years, the
Pitt News has been rated in ﬁrst-
class positions and for the ﬁve
preceding years in the All-Ame_r-
lcan class. An All-American rat-
ing indicates “distinctly superior

Edwin Peterson Uses Modern
Technique in English Lectures

By T. HOYT BRYANT

Professor Edwin L. Peterson
and his “new technique” called
“Peterson’s magic lantern” are re-
ceiving wide. acclaim throughout
American newspapers.

The ”technique” employs an
up-to—date magic lantern, used to
project colored drawings, pictures,
written material, and non-objec-
tive designs onto a 10-foot by 12-
Ioot screen to convey the “feel”
of writing to the students.

“Take a periodic sentence,” he
commented. “No kid knows what
a periodic sentence is any more—-
at least by name.

iBut if you have a design like

an ice cream cone with colored
stars where the ice cream
should be, and you slowly un-

cover it onthe screen, cxplain- -

ing that a periodic sentence
builds slowly and then explodes
like a. Roman candle, and then
---WHAM--you pull the slide
off the cover and shoot off a
pistol, tl1ey_’re likely to get it.”

The class can follow each para-
graph, sentence and word on the
screen, as well as corrections and
changes Peterson makes from his
lectern.

Peterson has worked on the
“technique” for two years but
the current academic year marks
its first use for large classes. Cur-
rently teaching three sections of
.'200,,,stu.dents, Peterson and an as-
sociate, Mr. Abe Laufe, expect
ﬁve sections in the fall with a
combined enrollment of 1,750.

The inability of ::o1lege stu-
dents and graduates to express
themselves on paper has been a
matter of serious concern. If
trained instructors used the sys-
tem in high schools, Peterson
feels colleges could save more
than $10,000,000 in remedial Eng-
lish courses.

"But more important, it could
teach thousands of students the
all-important skill of express-
ing "xeir thoughts in clear and
forceful writing,” the professor
said.

Peterson added that students
are learning almost twice as fast
as they have previously in his

.01? their ﬁnal class

classes, and he is in a position to
know. The professor has taught
at the University for 33 years,
.founding the first writing major
(as opposed to a literature .ma—
jor) in the country in the 1940’s.
Receives Ovation

His students have been pub-
lished in every major American
magazine. Last year, two ex—stu-
dents published their ﬁrst novels,
while a third, Literary Guild win-
ner, Gladys Schmitt, sold her ﬁfth
book. .

One of the first novelists,
Peter Beagle, author of “A Fine
And Private Place”, dedicated
his book “to my mother and
father, and, as it must be, to
Edwin L. Peterson.”

Dramatic as “Peterson"s magic
lantern” may seem, the popular-
ity of “Pete” Peterson was defin-
ed by a recent occurrence in a
Cathedral classroom. At the end
in English
composition, 200 students stood
up and unanimously applauded
their teacher . . . a rare sight in-—
deed in any ‘classroom.

Litchfield, Educators Consider
‘Cdllege Crisis’ On Open End "

By MATTHEW NESVESKY

Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld and ﬁve other top authorities
on American higher education
prob-ed perceptively into the “Col-
lege Crisis” on David SL'5skind’.s-
“Open End” show on WQED, a
few weeks ago.

The program, had as its guests,
along with the Chancellor, Calvin
Hastings Plimpton, President of
Amherst College; John W. Gard-
ner, Carnegie Foundation oﬂicial;
Katharine E. McBride, President
of Bryn Mawr College; Professor
David Boroﬁ, of New York Uni-
versity; Chester M. Alter, Chan-
cellor of the University of Den-
ver. .

College aplications doubling by

',1970 was, unsurprisingly, the first

college problem_ to be debated.
Gardner held that the crux of
the matter is in the need for more
faculty members. Dr. Litchﬁeld
then followed up in a lengthy ex-
planation of the need for “an en-
tirely new re—thinking process”
from all angles to thwart the pop-
ulation explosion’ in colleges.
New Resources Needed

The Chancellor stressed the

.need for a re—examination of

“every available resource,” and he
enumerated building space, time,
ﬁnances and manpower. The re-
thinking, it was agreed, must re-

place Restoration day education which helped rake more facets of. AIISWBPI ' Y€‘S-—--—-—-—- N0v~~-'~——-———-

year and, ultimately, the Tri-
mester plan. Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld pointed out that he did not
believe the “University of Pitts-
burgh Plan, the Penn State
Plan, or any other variation,
was necessarily best,” but he
did emphasize that using time
as a. resource had unlimited
value in ﬁghting crowded col-
legc chaos.

Hand-in-hand with the popula-

tion explosion, it was interjected,
came the knowledge explosion.
The fact thatthere is more to be
learned every day, said Plimp-
ton, should only be “making the
situation of higher learning in
America more vivid to its citi-
zens.” ,
Research’ or Teaching

This brought the educators back
to the subject of faculty. Should a
professor be more concerned with
research or» teaching?

The role of women in college
was brought up, with the in-
evitable reminder that 65% of
Russia’s doctors are females.
Miss McBride of Bryn Mawr
outlined the position of the girl
graduate and the social impli-
cations which have simultane-
ously descended on our society
as a result.

The» question of married stu-
dents logically followed, but was
headed off by Susskind’s ques-
tion: “Is the college degree a
status symbol?” Heated debate
followed, but the heat boiled the
answer down to a lugubrious

' “yes.”

The video—taped program con-
tinued in this manner, with em-
phasis on deﬁning and clarifying
the questions at hand. The parti-
cipants had a wealth of facts and
statistics with them, apparently,

last Tuesday when. they defeated Rep. John T. ‘Walsh’s res-
olution calling for an-investigation into alleged subversive
activity here. i '
During the time interval -from January to the present,
when the Walsh" resolution was pending and the reactionary

‘representative from McKeesport was attempting to boost

his political status in a McCarthy fashion, the investigating
commit’tee appointed by Chancellor Litchfield was working
diligently in assimilating material on Dr. Robert G. Colodny,
associate professor of history.

This committee under the chairmanship of Philip H.
Powers deserves the favorable vote that the 125 of the 194
state legislators cast. 0

They have not been stalling in order to see if the issue
would die, but rather have ’ vigorously ‘supported the
Chancellor in his attempt to wipe away the mysterious
fog that surrounds Dr. Colodny’s politicalfbeliefs. ‘

The disinterested test which Chancellor Litchﬁeld will
take in the near future when he examines the data which
the investigating committee submits, is by far the most
difficult task to be undertaken by the University in this
investigation.

Although there islnoidoubt :in our minds that the .

Chancellor’s interpretation will demonstrate" both wisdom
and courage, his interpretation cannot possibly pacify all
people.

The P'ittsburgh. Press during the past few months im-
pressed the judgment on its readers that the University
houses subversive instructors. No matter how unbiased the
University’s evaluation is, these impressions will remain
stamped. on the reader’s minds for many years.

Despite public opinion, the vicious actions of a reaction-
ary press and the accusations of a political status seeker,
we believe that the Chancellor will formulate his report to
the public with the idea of reﬂecting his own knowledge
and illustrating beliefs which coincide with the character
of a university. We join with the state legislators ingiving

a vote of conﬁdence to the University.

Walking for Peace . . .

Vanguard of Pacifism

By Jim O'Brien
Attention and class participation perked up to a.
sizzling degree the other night in a World Politics
class when Scott Herrick, the vanguard for the

A Committee for Nonviolent Action, was sprung loose

on the newly-assembled group.

Resembling a character out of the pages of Jack
Kerouac, Herrick, a husky, ath- ,
letic-looking evangelist, clothed
in a terry—cloth jersey and chino
pants stimulated the class to

international peace.

After hearing the man, I feel
that the whole world had best
become listeners to his plea,
though advocating academic
freedom, I would caution those
who listen, to sort out what is
logical, and discard what is
radical. V

Herrick asks governments to renounce massive
retaliation, train and organize their.citizens for
nonviolent resistance, take the initiative in dis-
armament, immediatelystart conversion to a pros-

perous economy, and begin generous, large scale,

non-military aid programs.
Class Laughs . .

The class chuckled at Herrick during most of
his. talk, but he reminded them that in European
classrooms, war is not a laughing matter. War is
a real thing; Europeans have already experienced
bombings and deaths of loved ones.

Herrick startled the group when he told of an

' Ohio State iUniversityNstudy that revealed “that

odds are 3-2 that we’ll survive the next ten years.”
I wish that the gamblers could “fix” those num-
bers in our behalf.

One of the reasons that the “-books” are so
lucrative is because in the next decade eight more
nations are expected to have the H—Bomb.

Reward for Help . _ ,

 

Herrick is an odd—ball of sorts, but his ideas are
sound. He has $100,000 in stocks and bonds in New
York, but chooses to have all the dividends circu-
lated in charities, rather than have the government
take their slice. He frowns upon income tax be-
cause one of its uses is the defense program.

Furthermore, he is contented to live on $600 3
year to keep from backing any war progi-amS_
Strangely enough, Herrick once served in the Navy,
but he confesses, “I was a moral idiot. I was an
adolescent stimulated by the comic book versions
of a sailor.” *

“When I left the service, money had very ljtue
meaning. I wanted to find myself. Too many peo.
ple today have the Cadillac ideology. But if we
don't get behind this peace program instead of
steering a big black car, we’re doomed.”

Millions May Perish

' And we well might be, if war ever does break
out, for we all know the lethal weapons of today
could obliterate the face of the earth, and the mil-
lions of faces that live on it. g V

“Khrushchev is afraid of war, but mostof all,
he is afraid of a better idea,” Herrick remarked.
He then elaborated on his program for an intellec-.
tual warfare. ‘

He cited how bad we must have looked before
the world when we backed Franco, the dictator of
Spain, in order to secure an air base. Despite the
fact that his ideology was contrary to ours, we
adopted his cause. ,

Reading books and adopting new philosophies
may be our only means ofsalvation. Shelter areas
and hideouts won’t work. Herrick himself laughed
at New York’s planto have Manhattan evacuated
by taxi cabs. Can you imagine? Have you ever
tried to get anywhere “in, a‘ hurry in New York
my cab‘? , it

As Einstein remarked, “We must have a basic
change of attitude if we are to live.”

“War will not be spelled w-a—r,” Herrick con-
cluded, “but E-N-D.”

n the Line of Duty

By Jim Nelson
Have you ever wondered what it must ‘be like
to be caught in the tempest of a storm, the wrath

of a man to man battle, or the mass terror of wild »
What

would you do‘? Would‘ you run?
Would you hide‘? Would you
watch?

Now think of a panty raid
You are a graduate ﬂoor coun-
selor; your job is to know the »
boys well, to guide them, to ad-_
vise them. ‘You have worked for
two terms‘ gaining conﬁdence,

gang,” a swell. guy. You have
done a good job. .The boys like
you; the University is pleased
with your counseling.

Then on the last night of your responsibilities
somebody starts a riot, Students rally to plan an
attack. Everybody reads about panty raids -
they‘rc really cool. Why not?

Doing Your Job

There you are, just a guy named John, an aver-
age 5—l'oot, l0-inch, male, standing in the stair
well of a dormitory with nothing but your smile
and personality to stop excited football players,
wrestlers, and brutes, from going past you down to
the female section of the dorm to snatch panties
from screaming girls. .

You know these guys well. A few of them have
not stopped to reason that once they step into the
female section, they will be handed their walking
papers on the way out. Some of them are ﬂunking

 

out this term anyway and it would make no dif.
ference. The rest are just along for the excitement.

You put your arms around three of them, smile,
and ask, “where are you going, fellows?”

“Just downstairs, John.” They pick you‘ up and
set you down on the nextstep.

“What f01‘ 1305757 Why do you want to go down
stalls?” ,

“Nothing, John.” (Where did you go? Out.
What did you do? Nothing.) The boys move you
down another step. Your legs are shaking, but your
smile is still solid, unmovable. They move you
down another step.

Buddy to Hie Boys _ .

“Come on John. You’re our buddy. You’re not
like the other floor counselors; you’re one of us
John. We like you John. Thought you liked us.
We’re only having a little fun.”

They are Slipping by you now, one at a time,‘

and you are not sure what to do next. The crowd
is like a ton of dynamite waiting for a match.
You’re losing, sinking, failing. What can you do?

You suddenly realize that you can’t win by be-
mg 8 nice g‘U.V.~—you must play the rugged, stone-
hearted role of an administrator.

Your spine straightens and you shout with every
bit of warning, violence, and authority you can
1‘3U.Y, “Shut up. Get back up here. Go back to
your rooms. Get out of the stair well. I mean it."

They put you down and look at you. Are you
serious? You’re not the John they know. Are you
lust as distant as the rest of the counselors. Just
a bum. The crowd ﬁlters away, looking back in
amazement, disappointed. Finally they are gone,
and You are left alone. You have done your job:
lost a few friends. ‘

Letters to the Editor

Crowded Classrooms

Hinder Education

Editor, The Pitt News.‘
Although there are fewer peo-
ple on campus during ‘the sum-
mer months (as witnessed by the
Tuck Shop void), class sizes

my experience I can readily say

that, when compared to the win- I challenge

ler trimester, my classes have
doubled.
In an English 159 section

(Wednesday night) the room is

jammed with 64 students. -Two
other of my night classes have
exceeded the instructor’s prefer-
red number of enrollments by at
leasiggge factor of two.

This crowding or what should
be class-participation courses de-
feats the purpose of the instruc-
seem to have grown. At least in tor, and rcertainly hinders the
studcnt’s chance to learn.
those
structed this atrocity of course
schedules to justify their actions
in overloading the teachers. It
appears to be a moneyrgrubbing

 

scheme. 9

This creates a case of Why
Cant Johnny Read on the col-
lege level. Instructors can’t pos-
sibly devote the necessary time
which each student in his class
should demand.

And it follows that a Pitt edu-
cation won’t be worth a damn;
if its graduates enter the com-
petitive adult world after being
denied the opportunity for 8
thorough education.

In just a matter of weeks many of you will be gra(luating-

You are of course eager to go out in the great world where
opportunitties are limit-less and deans nonexi.stent. At the same
time your hearts are heavy at the thought of losing touch with
so many classmates you have come to know and love.

It is my pleasant task today to assure you that graduation
need not mean losing touch with classrriates; all you ha,.ve to do
is join the Alumni Association and every year you will receive
a bright, newsy, chatty bullet-in, chock full of informal.-ion about
all your old buddies. ‘

Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone oil the hook, dismiss my chiropractor, put the ocelot
outside, and settle down for an evening “)f pure pleasure with
the Bulletin and (need I add?) a. good supply of Marlboro
Cigarettes. ' .

Whenever I am having fun, a. Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That ﬁlter, that ﬂavor, that pack or box never fails
to heighten my pleasure whether lam watching the television
or playing buck euchre or knitting an afghan or reading Mad
or enjoying any other fun-ﬁlled pursuit you niiglit name——ex-
cept, of course, spearfisliing. But then, how much spearti.~:hing
does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and let
me quote for you the interesting tidings about all my old friends
and classmates:

Well, fellow alums, it certa_inl_v has been a vving—(linger of at
year for all us old gradsl_ Remember Mildred Clieddar and
Harry Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in
Econ II? ‘Veil, t~hey’re married now and living in Clovis, New
Mexico, where Harry rents spearfisliiug equipment and Mildred V
has just given birth to a lovely 28-pound <.lauglit»er, her second
in four months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

.Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to sue-
ceed? VVell, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week he
was voted “Motorman of the Year” by his fellow workers in
the Duluth street-car systein. “I owe it all to my br-akema.n,’,’
said Jr-tthro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!

V. Probably the most glamorous time of all us alums was had by A
Francis Macomber last year. He went on a big game hunting
sa.la.ri all the way to Africa! We received many interesting post
cards from Francis until he Was, alas, accidently shot and killed
by his wife and white hunter. Tough luck, Francis!

Wilma. “Deadeye” Macomber, widow of the late beloved
I~"ranc.i,~'. Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred “S\ireshot”

Co-Captains Douglas.
Martens Lead Cats
To Easy Victories
By BOB SMIZIK
- Coach Bill Surnmer’s tennis
squad will sport a 4-1 mark
when they host Duquesne at
the Taylor Allderdice courts
tomorrow. The netmen added

two victories to their record
last week with wins over Du-
quesne and Waishington & Jeffer-
son. ‘ n i

The Bluffites were easy prey as
they lost 9-0. The Generals prov-
ed to be a bit tougher but were
beaten 6-3.

Newly-elected. captains
Martens and Jack Douglas led the
Cats in their dual victories. Doug-
las remained the teams only un-
beaten player. while his fellow
captain turned in a pair of
doubles victories with help “from
his partner, Paul Kochman.

Summers was well pleased
with the team’s showing against
‘Washington and Jefferson.
“They had a strong team but
our boys played real well,”
stated the coach. The youthful
mentor was also happy about
Dave O’Loughlin’s first win of
the year against Duquesne. “I
think that win will give Dave
the conﬁdencekhe needs to be-
come a. winning player.”

The return match with Du-
quesne should not be too stiﬁ‘ a
test for the netters. The boys from
Downtown have two good players
in Marty Katz and Cliff Harvi-.
son. However, Joe‘ Brown and
Douglas subdued these two last
week. A break in the weather
will help the netmen .im:measurc-
ably.

Panthers Fall to Slippery Roclc;
Shuttcrly Blasted for ‘7 Runs

The Pitt baseball team opened their 196l. home season
at Forbes Field and tried to copy the Pirates notorious Silky
Sullivan ﬁnishes,~but they started their stretch drive too
late, and Slippery Rock overwhelmed them, 8-2.

Starter Ralph Shutterly lasted 1% innings before he
was blasted off the rubber with a seven run outburst by the

rockets. " 5‘

in the second inning. Ralph, the
ace of the Cat’s staff, yielded seven
hits and three free passes.

Reliefer Bill Shay didn’t get
tagged for any runs, but he did
surrender four hits and four walks
in a 3%, innings stint. Larry Carra
was touched for one run in the
eighth inning, and Lauren Guthrie
struck out two batters in the ﬁnal
inning and didn’t allow a hit.

The Panther’s scored only two
runs and both came in the last
of the ninth. Tony DeLuca, the
Rot-.ket’s hurler gave up only
two hits in his six inning per-
formance, and Pitt got only four
all afternoon.

Second-baseman Howie Mallet,
who collected one of those hits,
drove in one, and Mike Supsura
collected an rbi immediately after
Mallet, grounding out to the short-
stop with the bases-loaded. .

Mallet shocked the small but on-
thusiastic crowd of 101 people in
the ﬁfth inning when he fell over
the rail by the box seats. It ap-
peared that he would be knocked
out, but Mallet executed a beau-
tiful somersault. “That boy ought
to be on (Warren) Neiger’s gym-
nastic team,” Coach. Carl Peterson
remarked.

The Panthers now own a 2-0

record.

vfohnny Michelosen was def-
initely not the “most happy

lowing his team’s first seven

V games.

A ,_I;Iis charges had amassed a

"mediocre 3-4 record, and the

roughest part of the schedule lay

ahead. They lost badly to TCU
and Southern Cal.; Syracuse ran
over them, and West Virginia,
iwhich ﬁgured to be a breather on
the murderous schedule, had
turned the tables‘ and dumped

the Cats, 23-15.

 But fortune began to shift the
other way for the Panthers. Jun-
ﬁr fullback Jim Cunningham, and

-l,-Bob Clemens, a sophomore half-
back, worked their way into con-

» dition after early-season in'uries.

: Another sophomore halfbac , Fred

‘Cox, broke into the lineup when
guard Norton Seaman was injur-

. kicking chores for the Michelosen

racked their last four opponents,
had the misfortune to play the
revamped Panthers instead of the
old version. The C-Boys scored
all the points in a crunching 22-

Clever Running
Clemens set up one score with
his clever running, then fended
off a desperation BC pass inside
his own ten yard line as the ﬁnal
gun sounded.

Freddie Cox did the rest. He

. Tennis has often been referred
toyas the “Sport of Kings,” and
this isn’t very far-fetched. Back

in the fourteenth century, leg-
end has it that a court jester in-

nobility. He gave them a small
bag ﬁlled with hair to amuse
themselves with between social
affairs of the castle.

As time went on, the nobles

more durable. They added a string

u Tennis continued to flourish in
the castles and developed into
quite a game. At one point betting

‘was common. Then the roof tell
in. The King of France discover-
ed that commoners were playing
the game. He didn’t like it, be-
cause the game was meant for
nobility. So he issued a decree
outlawing the game.

But this didn’t deter the com:
moners; they took the game

,, “underground,” where it con-

tinued to grow. By the end of
the 1800’s, lawn tennis was be-
ing played in England and
France, with well developed
equipment and rules. It was
played on grass, as some of it is
today. I
When tennis first came to
America around 1900, the cost of
equipment and the inconvenience
of grass courts was considerable,
so the game flourished in the
fashionable clubs on the East
coast.
At one point it was considered

ball. But some went beyond this

pace and speed. They soon found
that this new game of the “idle
rich” was a ﬁne contest of speed,
agility, and skill.

Since those days tennis has
grown into a wonderful sport that
everyone can play, anywhere in
the world. The rules, scoring, and
court size are the same in almost
every nation in the world.

George Izo, Red Mack, Monty
Stickles —— a top unit all the way.
But the C-Boys came through
again, leading the Jungle Cats to
a sparkling 28-13 decision.

All three had a share in the
glory. Clemens broke into the
scoring column early, hauling in
an Irish punt on his own 36 and
speeding his way to the end
zone. In the second quarter,

Cox raced 44 yards with a pitch-
out to make it 14-0.

After a long ND pass had cut
the gap in half, Cunningham cul-
minated two Panther drives with
searing plunges of five and three
yards. Notre Dame drove for a
ﬁnal score against the reserves,
but the season log for Mike’s boys
read 5-4.

Richie Lucas Day

The next Saturday was suppos-
ed to be Richie Lucas Day at Pitt
Stadium. The young man from
Glassport was being hailed as the
best all-around player in college
ball.

Mr. Lucas ran into a ﬁred-up
defensive line that held him in
check, while the C-Boys ~took
care of the scoring punch.

Cunningham gained only 57
yards, but his blocking was in-
fallible. Clemens gained over a
hundred yards, including a 35-_
yard pitchout for a tally. Freddie
Cox carried the ball twelve times,
scored a touchdown and gained
130 yards in the process.

The touchdown came on an
electrifying 86-yard sprint from
scrimmage that opened up the
second half with a bang. Final
score: Pitt ‘22, State 7.

Dr. George Boas Ends

[Wellon Professorship

By SUSANNA DOWNIE
Dr. George Boas, Visiting Mellon Professor of Philoso-
phy, is worse luck for us, no longer visiting. For the past

two trimesters he has been delighting and enlightening the.

fortunate students in Phil. 111 and 130. Next year he will
teach and entertain at Wesleyan (Connecticut). '
Those who knew him ‘at Pitt will remember him not so

4 much for the number of books?
he has written (which is consid-’

erable) nor the impressiveparray
of honors which have been heap-
ed on his scholarly brow but
more for his greatness ata teach-
er, of values as well as facts. Dr.
Boas is a real-live, honest- to-
goodness incarnation of the oft-
proclaimed but too seldom real-
ized goalof all education —- the
Rational Man; and irrational, re-
_latively ignorant undergraduates
in his classes suddenly recall that
this is indeed what they are in
school for. _,

The fact that this goal has been
so widely lost sight of is brought
out in his article, “The _Three
Magic Letters” (see Pitt. March
1961), where he deplores the sup-
erfluousness of a great deal of
modern American so-called edu-
cation. He does so cleverly, but
without being impertinent, (which
he has often been accused of be-
ing) because he is the first to de-
fend the value of knowledge and
the necessity for training in the
basic skills of learning. Behind
the rambling iconoclasm of his
lectures one always sensed an at-
titude of good will, which never-
theless would not tolerate men-
dacity or stupidity. A

Dr. Boas grew up in Providence,
R. 1., playing ice hockey with his
four brothers and conjugating
verbs at the local Latin school.
This was followed by more of the
same, plus Greek, at Brown Uni-

versity, where he “sulked,” wrote
some poetry, and ground out what
must have amounted to millions
of words for English Literature
courses, which, however dull in
the doing. turned out to be pro-
ﬁtable, for it provided him with
a. thorough training in composi-

tion, and resulted in his _fluent
and lucidly written books in
aesthetics, philosophy, and the

history of ideas. -

His friend and colleagues at
of “The Great Chain of Being”)
summed up the more mundane
aspects of his life with the ob-
servation that Boas was the only
man he had ever known who “had
been in both World Wars, in both
the Army and the Navy, and
could milk a cow.”

But Dr. Boas seems to have
transcended these trying experi-
ences —— education, military serv-
ice, cows (he had a dairy farm in
Maryland) and all -— to become
a stimulating and encouraging
scholar, ‘V not simply an erudite
name-dropper, and a great teach-
er, interested in students and
ideas for what he can learn from
them, not because he can mani-
pulate them.

At age seventy, in August, he
will still be What is perhaps most
receptive to new ideas. He is, in

short, a young man, and we are
sorry to see him‘ leave.

Legal Consultants Submit Last
Colodny Report to Committee

(Continued from Page 1)
‘defeated Walshsresolution for a
state investigation by a 125 to 69
vote, following Walsh’s new charge
that Dr. Colodny had stated his

communist associations while par-
ticipating in a radio broadcast in
Chicago in 1938.

Powers said that the commit-
tee was aware of all the inci-
dents cited by Rep. Walsh. Con-
cerning the 1938 radio program,
he said that there was no tape
of the program since at ’ that
time neither tapes nor phono-
graphs were in use.

“We got our information from
Washington sources concerning
this broadcast,” Powers said, “and
it will be included in the report-
to the-Chancellor?)

When Powers was questioned
as to whether the committee was
stalling the investigation in order
that the issue might ‘die, he an-
swered, “not one day has passed
that I have not called our legal

‘ counselors; in addition, our com-

mittee has had weekly meetings
and conferences which consume
many hours.”

Powers said that no one could

i ascertain the exact day when the

Chancellor would issue the report
to the public. It will be up to
him to evaluate the facts and
present his conclusions to the state
assembly and the press.

Whether he will appoint an ad-
ditional committee to help him
evaluate the material submitted,
is not known. ‘
