Micholein’s nomination address
was made by Morton Goldstein,
vice—president of MC, who seems
to be a good-luck charm for coun-
cil aspirants. He delivered the
nomination speech for Allan Rob-
bins two weeks ago and subsi-
quently Robbins was unanimously
elected.

One of the most surprising fea-
tures o_f“ the election was that
Micholein defeated two fraternity
men for the post, something that
has not happened in council for
a long time‘.

As Goldstein put in his nomina-

opinion in Men’s Council. I think
the only fair thing to do is elect
Micholein.” '
Many Activities

Some of the newly elected cou-
cilman’s activities are Engineering
and Mines Society, YMCA, and
Rocket Society.

After the election, Ronald Ecker,
president of MC, said, ‘‘I’m very.
happy to see that MC did not play
politics and voted as -they felt-

Custodian" Hlerei  Years

‘Pop’ Harbison Cares for Chapel  

By ELINORE STONE
When visitors ‘and students
enter Heinz Chapel, admire

thericraftsmanship of the chan-

ble stained—glass windows and lis-
ten to the clear, vibrant organ mu-
sic, their thoughtsiprobably don’t
turn to the practical question of

who keeps the Chapel‘ in its state ‘

of perfection.

‘ Well, a little-known man named
Harry Harbison is ciistodian of
Heinz Chapel. And, he cares for it

- and treats it as he might a child,

. devotedly and lovingly. , -
"‘It’s part of my life,” says Mr.
Harbison, better known as ‘Pop.’
“And I’m very.proud of it.” ’

Came Here. 1942

The Chapel became a part of ‘
- Pop’s life just ten years ago. He-

came here in April of 1942 after 23

years in the grocery business.‘

When his _so_n-in-law. who had

managed the grocery _store with‘ ’

the 69-year-old -custodian joined

‘the service, Mr. Harbison sold out .

and came to Pitt to make the quiet
Chapel his daytime retreat.

glittering, the woodwork shining,
the ' cushions dust-free, the ﬂoor

Plainly, he’s inecharge.
Varied Experiences

Mr. I-Iarbison has seen visitors ‘

from all over the world come and
go, studentspray, choirs sing and
young brides sweep up the aisle
and out into a new life from
Heinz Chapel. And, Pop _likes
‘what he’s seen.

' “Ilike to be among young peo-
ple,” he explains. “It keeps an
old person more active.”

“According to s t a t i s t i c s, I
’haven’t much more time to live,”
he added -smilingly. “But, I’m _in

His good health is one reason
why Pop hasn’t missed a presiden-

this past one. When it comes to‘

“I won’t say whom I voted for.

The other day I located the
,quotation. Here it is:

In solitude, ‘or in society? In the
green stillness of the country,-
where he can hear the heart of

_and say,‘in-.the dark gray town.”

Dr.’ H. C. Carlson’s biggest groan is trying to teach the
\ Pitt cagers his continuity system'and his broken wheel of-
fense in the short time allotted by the new NCAA rule which
outlaws pre-seasontbasketball drills before Nov. 3.

As a result, the usually congenial Carlson coolly refused
to discuss the matter after watching his veteran squad,
which lost only Captain J ohn\Kendrick, stumble through the

ﬁrst week of practice.

"Carlson contends that the new ruling, which in Pitt’s
case puts practice to three weeks, does. not permit sufﬁcient

Reynolds Voices’
Words of Wisdom

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 
 

 

I would imagine that after several_ dozen locker room
scenes one becomes immune to the tears and cheers of play-
ers and coaches. ‘ .

Many times coaches cry the blues while simultaneously
the players, in merrier moods, rejoice. Despite their per-
formances, good or bad, victories are to be celebrated, ac-
cording to the gridders. Rarely does-the reverse take place.

‘ During Pitt’s hungrier days,
unfortunately, even. Murine -could
not halt the ﬂood or tears that
drowned many gridders.

The one incident that I
best recall occurred after
_Pitt and Ohio -State squared
off last year. While the Pan-
thers Were ﬁghting back, Vic
Janowicz put an end to it all
in the third quarter with a
ﬁeld goal.

The dressing room scene that
afternoon, in my opinion, changed
‘a lot of attitudes, and then, as in
many cases this year, Billy Rey-
nolds “set up the play." Billy,
helmet in grip, swaggered "past

the mending tables. on which lay
a few of his teammates.

Usually, the senior halfback ---2» --
keeps the same hard working expression on and off the ﬁeld. Hes
just not-the talkative.type. This time, however,’_Reynolds opened up.

:“Lose, lose, lose, that’s all we do‘ is lose.”~ Short, sweet, and
"to the point the words hit some of the softer heads who, in more
quiet terms, also expressed sorts of discontent over the rut’ that

1

they had fallen into. They weren’t exactly proud of their record—-

one’ win and 15 losses in less than two years. _ H
One gridder, who has since departed, remarked, “Coming
from him it hurts. Bill always puts out his best.” ’

Well, the trend is changing. Since that dressing room'scene, the
Panthers have lost only twice in nine starts. And in the new move-
ment ‘Reynolds has been one of the most outstanding performers.
_ Good enough, in fact, to draw attention from the Writers’ Asso-
ciation of America wh-o pick the most accurate All-American teams
in football. It’s more diﬁicult to make a grid dream team in one
year when‘ your team is outstanding than to accomplish the feat
in successive years of victory.

The only excuse we can give for Reynolds is that his tal-
ents as a runner were camouﬂaged for two years.

Bowling, Badminton Begin _

IM bowling, a sport that in the
past was very popular here, has
become extinct. Bemis hasn’t re-
ceived an entrance blank.

Although a few IF sets have
played a few badminton matches,
all teams will swing into action
next week. Thirteen teams are
competing for birdie honors. All
matches are played at the Stadium
pavilion.

Interfraternity teams will ex-
pand their program Monday to in-
clude bowling and badminton. Leo
Bemis, intramural director, an-
nounced that 16 Greek teams will
be paired off into two leagues.

Bowling matches will again be
held at the University alleys from
4 to 6 pm. Pi Kappa Alpha, IF al-

hope to continue its streak.

Delts Take Frat Lead;

Playoff Survivors -Cut,

to the interfraternity ﬁnals as

they decisively whipped Pi Kappa Alpha, 19-7, Wednesday.
This victory assured, the Delts of at least a second place
ﬁnish in IF competition for the second-year in ‘succession.

They wound up as runnerups to:

Sigma Chi in last season’s exciting
race.

Fritzie Zivic, Monday’s hero,
once again sparked the Delts to
victory. He scored two of his
teams three touchdowns. The ﬁrst
on an end run, and the second on
an inside reverse. Jim Fisher also
hit paydirt for the Delts as he
scored on a pass from Dale Cho-
van.

Bud Spangler Stars
As Sig’s Advance

-Sigma Chi earned a chance to
play Pi Kappa Alpha in the semi-
ﬁnals yesterday as they trounced
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 26-7, at
Schenley Oval. S

The Sigs, last year’s IF cham-
pions,,kept their hopes alive of re-
peating due to the ﬁne all-around
play of Bud Spangler.

Spangler’s aerials connected for
three touchdowns. On the receiv-
ing end of these plays were Tom

Bill Shannon passed to Clark for
the Sigs’ other touchdown.

The gallant SAE’s put up a ter-
riﬁc battle in the ﬁrst half, but
were not able to cope with the Sigs
in the last half. Harry Daugherty’s
heave to Joe Depelhuer was their
only scoring play.

Bands Play
‘Hail to Pitt’

Forty-two district high
school bands _are
“Hail to Pitt” this year at
their -half time performances.
Druids, honorary activities fra-

ternity, ‘this year supervised the

distribution of complete band ar-
rangements of Pitt songs to local
schools. '

According to Elmer Shuster,
president of Druids,’ district band
directors were contacted and asked
if their organizations would be. in-
terested in receiving the arrange-

_ ments. -

' Directors from-‘ 4'2‘schools said

_that they would be interested, and‘

complete "band arrangements in
the Pitt Band style were sent _out.

West View High School’s band,
when it played in the stadium on
High School Day, blared,» forth
with one of the arrangements sent
out by Druids.

While most of_the leg work and

_.

contacting was done. by the Druids,

‘the idea ‘came from Student Con-
gress last year, and was chalked
up to better high school relations.

Money for the project, about
$180, was appropriated by Student

45

Congress. ’ -

Druids and Congress expect to
continue the project in the future.
