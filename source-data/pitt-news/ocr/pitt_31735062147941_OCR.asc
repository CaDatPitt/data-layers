crease their activity fund. The in-
creased fund will be used for the
purpose of giving every member of
the association the privilege of par-
ticipating in the Combined Musical
Clubs—-and each student to receive
exchange tickets for the recital; ob-
taining two exchange tickets for each
student for the Band Concert-; two
exchange tickets for the Cap and
Gown production and ﬁnally, to in-
clude subscription price to the Pitt
Weekly in the Evening School As-
sociation .\ dues. -

This decision will mean much to
the students of the Evening School
and should bring the past relations
between Evening and Day School
Students closer.

In the past, tickets were sold to
the students of the Evening School
for each activity named o-r seat re-
servation, they being treated the
lsame in this respect as was the pub-

1c.

It is the desire of the. Evening
School students to present their mo-

requested to submit it to the Board
of Trustees for their approval. The
present assessment for niembersh.ip

$5.00 a year, payable with the tuition

vide two dances, annual banquet,
smoker for the men and a party for
the girls of the School. The neces-

the privileges before related in addi-
tion to the usual social events is but
$4.00, making the total assessment

Reduction Will be Gradual 
The undergraduate school require-A 

ments for graduation were changed I
from 128 to 120 credits at a meeting  “

of the University Council ‘held last
Thursday, May 19.
Council -deemed this change‘ advisable

to bring the graduation requirememfs. 
at Pitt into harmony with the prac- 
tice of -other large institutions of the A.  ~

country. The commonly ‘accepted
standard for a lbachel-or’s degree has
come to be 120 credits.
versi-ty Council favored -the 120 hour

requirement rather than the 128,  
cause a lighter program of studies‘ 4
will permit more intensive work in  j;

the su-bjects»-carrieid.

The schools effected by the change I 
are College, Education and Eco_no- 
mics. This change does not effect the  
Schools of Minesiand Engineering be- . — I
cause they graduate by courses and D 

not by credits.

By this plan the students are re- A 
quired to complete 30 credit hours;

Students at present in the

University will be required to pre-  
sent 32 credits for each past year’

follows: the present Senior class will  ,
graduate with 128 credits, the Junior   -,9
class with 126, the Sophomore class-'..-:. I
with 124, the Freshman class with 
122 and the new incoming Freshn1.a»n..jw.

he called attention to the fact that
the Frick plot should be hovered with
modern gothic structures and that he
intended to use consideraable energy
in making the buildings a reality.

When he closed, Mr. Williams call-

thing that the doctor had failed to ‘

state and that was that the uni'Vers~ity

the excellent management of Dr.
Bowman.
Dr. L. H. Botkin, as an alumni of

Pitt, was asked.to make a few re-

a"strong ‘alumni and decried the fact
that one thousand young men had
been denied the privilege of entering
the institution this year. The State
of Pennsylvania was doing a wrong
to its youth and "a wrong that could
not be repaired to this ‘particular
youth. He told his hearers that the
work of development was being car-
ried on in the mill and that if a
workman did not ﬁt‘ in one depart-
ment he Was shifted to another with
the hope that he might develop.

J. M. Camp, well-known to many‘ of
Duquesne’s people, was then intro-
duced. The orator was inclined to be
facetious. He claimed that he had
never yet been asked to attend a din-
ner at which he had not -been wheedled
into “trying to make a speech.” He
said that he was “sore” when some
of the other speakers had called at-
tention to his age and in order to
set them right he Wanted it known
that Dr. Botkin was the attending
physician at the time of his (-Camp’s)
birth. In closing he said that he
fully agreed with everything that Dr.
Bowman had said and that as head
of «the educational department of the
Carnegie Steel Company he could say
that men ‘were being trained on the
1-ines*advocated by the chancellor.

of the enrollment was made up of ‘

regular students.

Summer school begins July 5 and
is in session six weeks with the ex-
ception of the courses in science
which continue two weeks after the
close of the regular summer term,
for the convenience of those who wish
to complete a full years’ work. This
makes it possible for pre-medical stu-

dents to fulﬁll the requirements in

any one science during the summer.
The fee for students carrying a

,full program for six weeks is $42.00

and for eight weeks the fee is $56.
Last summer there was an enroll-
ment of 01300. This summer, up to
the present, there -have been over one
thousand inquiries for information
and printed matter regarding the
summer school. There is. expected
to be an enrollment of over 2000 this
summer.

Students are expected to register
prior to the beginning of classes in
order to avoid the loss of time and
the annoyance of a late start. Classes
begin Wednesday, July 5,‘and regis-
tration should be completed July 1
or 3 at the office of the Registrar,
Students from a dis-
tance who are unable to reach the
University before Wednesday, July 5,
will be permitted to register on that
day. All registrations must be com-
pleted by 5 P. M.

At the close of the Summer Session
a graduation convocation; is held by
the University fair granting -degrees
to all undergraduate and -graduate
students completing their respective
curricula ‘at the en-d of the Summer
Session. The convocation for the
granting of degrees at the close of
be held

on Tuesday, August 15.

(By Minnie Z. Buckley, ’15.)
Time to begin to think about the
Sunset Dinner, our annual reunion for
Alumnae only. The more thinking and
talking‘ about it, the better the party,
and, as usual. we want this one of
1922 to be the best Yet. The one ele-
ment necessary 18 a big turnout.
Other factors making it a mile-stone
in Alumnae affairs will be well taken
care of -by the Committee lately nam-
ed: Chairman, Alpha Burkhart, '17.,
Anna Graham, ’17, Marie McSwiga._n,
'19,. Grace Gilson, ’20, Helen MacLeod,
’17, Gretchen Buske, '15, Helen
Schmucker, ’21,. and Mary Thompson,
’20, assisted by the Year Committee.
It is likely that the "party as hereto-
tore, will be a ‘dinner at the Heinz
House followed by a program of
sense and nonsense, chieﬂy the lat-.

will be a genuine -surprise, possibly
even to themselves. Date will be an-
nounced in next Weekly and as Com-
mencement is June, 14th you may
count on the day or so before that
for the Sunset Dinner. Talk about
it to every Pitt girl you see from
now until that day and see to it that
so many send in reservations that we
will have ‘to set tables on the lawn!

Pittites have been ,in Politics‘ in
more ways than one of late: Marie-
Mcswigan, '19, Marion Smith, ’20, and
Helen Hunt, '17, have been elected
City-County Committeewomen in their
respective districts. Marion is much
elated and remarks that "Holding
such an office -as this puts one direct-
ly in line to run for Governor or some
such" office!” As is the way with poli-
ticians Helen immediately plans on
a trip to Europe for the summer, ac-
companied by her aunt (unlike poli-
ticians,) sailing on the Antonia. July
1st to visit England, where they ex-
pect to do a. lot of hiking, France.
Switzerland, Italy and the Rhine
country “if they can -get enough
marks for the nickels they will have
left by that time.” Marie refused to
be interviewed on the subject of poli-
tics.‘ -

Coraopolis Hi‘gh*‘Sc’hool had -three
University girls on its roster of teach-
ers this year: Em-ma. Coombs, Ed
’21, History and English; ‘ Salome
Weaver, Ed '19,, Civics; and Helen’
Schmucker, Ed ’21. Emma z.Coo-mbs
was married last winter to Mr. Paul
Corley.

the summer Alpha is heading ‘.3. party
of 15 mostly members of the same

continent. They will visit London,
Paris, and Oberammergau and the
lake region and mountains of Switz-

Lduise Whitg, Ed "21, writes that
Pitt is well represented at Blairsville
High, with Laura Shaffer, Ed., ’21,
Grace Shontz, ’20, and herself on the

‘ faculty, and with a University man

expecting to be in town for the Sun-

Mary Elizabeth Piersol, ’19, came in
from Bentleyville Saturday for the
tea and gave -us news of her twin
(in name only), Mary, Bentley Pier-
sol, '16, whosailed for Java last Aug-

‘ ust and‘ was later married to E. J.

Bunker, B. S. S. E., '17, living at
Java.

Our lunch. at Iiaufmann-Baer’s on
Primary Day was quite the peptpdest
yet. Each one had her own {little
story of politics in general" and that
election in particular which together,
spiced with bits of humor, made an
interesting hour and a. half. New peo-
ple Were Mary Aiken, Alpha Burkhart,
Gretchen Buske, Marie Mcswigan,
Helen Donaldson, Anna Graham and
“Pete” Berlin. The swim in the eve-
ning showed the same spirit. We
were glad to Welcome back into the

held Saturday. It was the last affair
of which Helen Frost Dice will be

seemed to Want to make the -last the

the sidelights and the mantel. Cer-

sight of the campus had given us,

The final meeting of the club for
this semester was held on Wednesday,

for the study of Greek were analyzed
in the several ﬁelds of Science, Law,
Medicine, History, Philosophy and
Practical Affairs. . Thayer ‘explained

particularly of Chemistry is based e;-E
tensively-on_ Greek roots. ‘ Bishop
showed how the masterly _command
or synonyms supplied by the study of
Greek is indispensable to the lawyer

logic VGX‘cek is analogous = to that of

Greek to secure a thorough mastery

 Hows BANQUET

The debating squad of the Uni-
versity -held a banquet last week, at
which meeting it was decided to or-
ganize a debating association. The
purpose of the association’ is to per-
mit all students who are interested
in debating to participate in debates.
Under the o1d~syste'm, only those who
were competent enough to -become
members of the debating squad were
able to take part in delbates.

A committee was appointed to draw
up a constitution for the association.
The committee con-sists of C. R. Fos-
ter, Chairman’; C. E. Prager, E. H.
Levy, John D. S. Truxall, and Marie
Mes-ser. The debating association will
embrace both men and girls; although
their teams will be kept as separate
organizativons. The adoption "of the
Vconstitu-tion »by the debating squads,
which will -make up the nucleus of
the debating association,’ will place
debating inthe University on a ﬁrm-
erllbasis than in the past, and it is
expectedlthat iﬁlfwill stimulate debat-
ing and increase the prestige of the
University in that ﬁeld. . B

The association -will be known as
the University of Pittsburgh’ Debat-
-ing Associati-on. A meeting of the
association will be held. Tuesday eve-
ning of next week at 7:30 o’clock in
