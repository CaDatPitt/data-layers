dent body concerning activities of

bers of the SFA assembly held

night in 1201- Cathedral.

- Chief result of the meeting was

tions of Al Kairys, BA39, and Ann

Whippo, ‘C39. Elected to take their ,

places were Francis Durkin, BA39,
and Mary Annette‘ Campbell, C39.

Kairys, it was announced, re-
signed his position as committee-
man and SFA vice-president be-
cause of an excess amount of ac-
tivities points, while Miss Whippo
wasforced to give up her post due
to ill health.

‘A report of the largest proﬁt yet
realized fromgthe student book ex-
change project-was reported at the
second meeting of — Men’s Council
last Tuesday at 7:30 o'clock in the
dean of men's office.

According to Sandy McLeod, E39,
chairman of the bookstore project,
the commissions received from book
sales go into Men's Council Stu-
dent Loan fund, available to men
students at the University.

Because of his transferring from
the Schpol of Engineering to the
School of Dentistry, it was an-
nounced that Al Young, '40, had re-
signed and will be succeeded by
Ed Keiper, E40.

Bill Hoeveler, C39, president,
cleared up a m.is-statement which
had appeared in.--The Pitt News
concerning freshman keys. He told
members that no Pantherpins will
be given.

Instead Panther keys will be
awarded to outstanding freshmen
at the end of the first six-week
period. These keys will take the
place of the plaques awarded dur-
ing the last several years.

Another Men's Council plan calls
for_the organizations’ cooperation
with the intra-mural activities.

SFA Turns Down
'No Corsage' Plan

One of the most heated debates
in the history of SFA occurred
during last Tuesday night’s as-
sembly meeting, threatening, for
a time, to completely disrupt pro-
ceedings.

It all began when Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant dean of men
arose unexpectedly to present a
motion in favor of a “no-corsage
movement” for University dances.
Said Biddle, “We haven’t had a
movement on campus for some
time. I suggest we have a no-
corsage campaign. (Applause by
assemblymen.)

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, countered immediately,
“Mr. Chairman, I’m against it!”
(Applause by assemblywomen.)

Said Mary Annette Campbell,
C39“, “A dance is notva dance
without corsages.” ‘

At this point, Leonard S. Levi-

son, C39, broke in to suggest that
Mr. Biddle be established as
leader of the movement. Leo
Griffith, C39, defended the cause
with a long speech in which he
isaid',_“Some people would resent
the no-corsage campaign. I know
several people who send corsages
for any reason.” _ ' '

Sam Whiteman, BA40, next
moved that. “we are against cor-
sages whol1y.” Despite some sup-
port from assemblymen, the» mo-
tion failed to pass.

Independents I-Iold

A call for organization of inde-
pendents for next spring’s political
campaign was issued today by Jack
Hoeveler, C40, minority leader in
SFA. .

Contemplating -intensive pre-
election work, Hoeveler requested
all students in every school to at-
tend the meeting in 149 Cathedral
this afternoon at 2:30 o’clock.

“It will not require time or
money, only interest in a square
deal for independents at Pitt,” he
explained. Freshmen and sopho-
mores are especially invited.

Inquiry Takes
The Lead Again

An innovation in brain-twisters w_ill be
presented this afternoon when, according to
reports, Inquiry Forum will sponsor an essay
contest open to junior ‘and senior students,
on some as yet mysterious “United States
problem.

We have, of course, heard of essay contests
before, but this one promises ‘to be a little
out of the ordinary. No one, it seems,’ will
know what is to be written about until all
candidates are assembled together in some
University classroom, indicated elsewhere in
the News.

Such a situation should be able to draw out
the best minds in the University, who will no
doubt be eager to match their wits on some
“significant subject, and, incidentally to come
‘away with a cash prize.

For many years now, the Forum, spon-
sored by the University YM and YWCA, has
been bringingpromineiit campus, city, state,
national and even internationalauthorities
on all sorts of questions. According to indi-
cations-so far, this year’s group 1S carrying
out the old tradition, having already pre-
sented the Czechoslovak consul and several
other prominent speakers.

That such a contest should be sponsored by
Inquiry Forum, we think,‘ is only a further
credit to an organization which has been one

at the most consistent and worthwhile activi-

ties on campus.

Our own Mr. Biddle went Charley (no
parsley) Danver one better at the last SFA
meeting when he advocated a no-corsage
movement that threatened News and Pan-
ther advertising revenue. Leo Griﬂith, of the
Panther, and" Miss Amos reminded the as-
sistant dean that it was the little things that
made for romance. Has Papa Biddle already
forgotten?

At that same meeting, the same Mr. Biddle
walked into a fraternity set-up when he pro-
posed that new SFA executive members be
elected by a majority , vote instead of the
former plurality. At the last count, the divi-
sion stood at 25 to 5.

Dr. Silverman Lends
Violins to Students

Two violins valued at $650, one a century-and-a-
quarter old, were placed in the hands of two young
violinists recently. They were lent to these students
is prizes at the Musical Forecast program by Dr.
=\lexander Silverman, head of the chemistry de-
oartment.

The older of these instruments came from Ger-
nriny where it was owned by Dr. Silverman’s grand-
father, Alexander Schamberg. Because he thought
‘t was not worth saving, he suggested to his wife
that she “cook a cup of coffee on it.” Instead of
doing that, she had the instrument repaired for their
daughter, Nettie, Dr. Silverman’s aunt, to study on.

It was on this violin that Dr. Silverman took his
first lessons, and it was this aunt who was his ﬁrst
teacher. He studied later under Fidelis Zitterbart.
well-known Pittsburgh musician and composer. At
the age of 18, he was certiﬁed as a violin teacher.

But instead of making violin-teaching his voca-
tion, he worked as a glass research chemist. In his
ﬁrst chemistry position, in 1902, he rediscovered
the process for making alabaster glass, a process
which had been lost about 25 years before. This re-
discovered glass became almost universally used in
place of the less satisfactory opal glass, particularly
in the globes which enclosed Edison's carbon lamps,
the electric light bulbs of that day.

He later considered violin-teaching as a possible
career. His father advised him not to give up his
work in chemistry, and suggested that he take
further work in it. He followed his father’s advice
and spent a year studying at Cornell.

From Cornell he came to the University as an
instructor in chemistry where he has remained for
the past 33 years. A few years ago, Dr. Silverman
stopped playing the violin and ﬁve years ago he do-
nated his entire violin musical library to the Car-
negie Library.

Both he and his aunt, at her suggestion, decided
to give the violins to students who needed them and
would take care of them. The violins were recondi-
tioned and, with the cooperation of the Musical
Forecast executives, were loaned to the two young

‘people who were considered most deserving.

These students may renew the loan of the instru-
ments year after year by giving a certiﬁcate ac-
count of themselves and of the instruments. As long
as they take of the violins and continue to make
satisfactory progress in their music, they may con-
tinue to use them.

You Said It . . .

That’ 3 Different

“Copying one book is plagiarism; copying three
books is research,” says Professor V. Rapport, Con-
necticut state college.

Plea for Tolerance

President Thomas Gates, University of Pennsylvania:
“A university is a ‘place in which tolerance and
lack of bias should prevail. If we and the thousand
other colleges and universities of America do our job
well for the million and a quarter students who are
enrolled in them, our American democracy will be
given its best chances to work and to thrive."

Paving The Way

Dean John T. Madden, New York university:

“The increasing domination of government, the
modern notion that the individual must order his
life wholly according to the whims of those in con-
trol of society pave the way for a dictator.”

THE PITT NEWS
Deans Stage
Btﬁgiim

e n Spr

As usual, the assistant deans of
men are betting on the result of
the fall fraternity rushing. But
this year the stakes are much
higher.

Robert R. Corley will lose his
Panther—publicized mustache if his
guesses as to the number of bids
and acceptances are wrong. Theo-
dore W. Biddle promises to grow a
lip-tickler in case he has ﬁgured
wrong, and if Edward B. Williams
loses his wager, he has to indulge
in exercises to reduce his rotund
form.

Last year it was Mr. Biddle who
approached closest to the ﬁnal re-
sults of 624 bids, 406 individuals
bid, and 181 acceptances. This year
he wagers that 591 bids will be
given, 391 different men will get
these bids, and 169 men will pledge.

Mr. Williams ﬁgures that 610
bids will be offered, 395 men will
get them, and 185 acceptances will
be received. Mr. Corley, who is also
fraternity adviser, sets the num-
ber of bids at 620, with 400 dif-
ferent men getting them‘,*and 173
men deciding to become Greeks.

The results will be compiled and
made public at 5 o’clock on Mon-
day afternoon. How the deans will
look on Tuesday morning remains

to be seen. Watch The Pitt News
for details.

Members Elect Campbell, '

Durkin to Ruling Board

(Continued from page 1)

men and representatives of various
SFA committees presented reports
of their projects. First to report
was Leo Griffith, chairman of the
social committee.

Grifﬁth reported that the social
committee was sending letters to
members of the faculty inviting
them to act as “hostesses” at Uni-
versity social affairs. He also an-
nounced that the committee hopes
soon to start a series of tea dances.

In addition, Griflith outlined a
plan to charge men students more
than the women for entrance to tea
dances, in order to equalize atten-
dance. The proposal brought a
charge of “unfair discrimination”
from Jack Hoeveler, C40, and a
statement by Griffith that “wall-
flowers will always be with us,”
and ended by being left up to the
judgment of the social committee.

Next report was presented by
Mary Annette Campbell, for the
appointments committee, and con-
sisted of a report of the progress
of interviews for the Soph Hop and
Freshman dance. Miss Campbell
further announced that the ap-
pointments committee will hold in-
terviews for the Junior dance next
week, instead of at a later date, as
was formerly planned. Efforts are
being made, she announced, to ob-
tain the services of a “big name”
orchestra.

Demonstration block plans for
future games were presented by
Mr. Biddle in the absence of the
chairman. Biddle asked an expres-
sion of appreciation by the student
body for the work of the group.

Enthusiastic Group

' He also commented on the
“thoughtless throwing around of
equipment,” and declared that “the
committee is moving around with
enthusiasm.”

At this point, Jack Hoeveler in-
quired, “Do you feel that we could
move the block to the other side of
the Stadium, so that the students
can watch the formations?”

The parking situation was then
discussed by Will Sklar, BA40,
chairman of the parking commit-
tee. Sklar discussed parking plans
for Ruskin Field and outlined a
plan to paint “parking stalls” on
streets adjoining the Cathedral in
order to arrive at more compact
parking.

Concerts to Swing

Report of the Concert Hour com-
mittee was presented by Robert
Brown, C39, chairman, who an-
nounced that ‘a series of Wednes-
day afternoon concert hours will
be presented throughout the se-
mester with the emphasis on
“swing.” ,

Brown declared his group plans
to present the history of the dance
0 r c h e s t r a, demonstrating how
swing evolved, and how bands are
built up. Guest artist on future
programs, he said, may include
Duke Ellington, and soloists from
the Pittsburgh Symphony.

Mr. Biddle again took floor to
report for the newsreel theatre
committee. He announced that “we
have everything but the room” in
which to show a continuous pro-
gram of movies at a nominal price
to students. Other matters pertain-
ing to competition with local thea-
ters also ﬁgure, he added.

: Suggested as a. location was
Stephen Foster Memorial. The only
drawback, Mr. Biddle explained, is
that the Memorial doesn’t have pro-
jection equipment.

Vandalism Charged

This brought up the question of
alleged vandalism by students in
Stephen Foster memorial. Dean
Amos, who had declared previous-
1y, ‘‘I have heard some students say
that they would hate to see that
beautiful Foster Memorial changed
into a movie house,” added that
“there ought to be a respect for
lovely things, else we will not have
lovely things to enjoy.”

Leonard Levison, C39, chairman
of pep assemblies, announced that
preliminary arrangements had been
made for a pep rally before the
Fordham game. It will be held dur-
ing the fourth hour, Friday, Octo-
ber 28. Tentative plans include the

/A

I wr-

appearance of the demonstrations
block and speeches by prominent
sports authorities.

“Possibilities as speakers,” said
Levison, “include Bill Corum, Joe
Williams, and Gene Tunney. Of
these three, the least likely to a-p-
pear is Tunney.”

A bonﬁre before the Carnegie
Tech game is also planned, accord-
ing to Levison.

‘Nebulous’ Committee

Ed Springer, C39, chairman of
the High School Relations commit-
tee, spoke of prospective debates
to be sponsored between high
school teams, at the University, on
December 10. He admitted, how-
ever, that his group was still in
“an extremely nebulous state.”

Francis Durkin, C39, reported on
the Scholars’ Day committee, stat-
ing that since the event was sched-
uled for the second semester, no
deﬁnite plans can be announced as
yet. He added also that because of
the Chancellor’s absence, it has
been impossible for the committee
to obtain financial support.

The. committee reports ended,
President John Downie, C39, an-
nounced that the Student Directory
would be on sale soon.

Next matter to be discussed was
post-football-game demonstrations.
It was suggested that SFA go on
record as disapproving of football
holidays or other such demonstra-
tions by students. Dr. Lanfear
made the comment that “this type
of thing is dying out like hazing.
We’ve grown to the point that we
can take a stand with more mature
people.”

Demonstrations Debunked

Bernard Mayer, C39, put the sug-
gestion into the form of a resolu-
tion, adding that SFA should take
any means that they see ﬁt of pub-
licizing their intention. The mo-
tion, though not carried unanimous-
ly, was passed by a majority show-
ing of -hands.

Mr. Biddle warned against dem-
onstrations on rival campi before
games. The president was asked by
the Assembly, unanimously, to
meet with representatives of the
Carnegie Tech Student Council to
attempt to enact an agreement pro-
hibiting vandalism.

The question of The Pitt News
status was brought up, and much
debate followed. However, since
SFA had approved the reorganiza-
tion plan presented by John Weber.
business manager and secretary of
the University, at the previous din-
ner meeting, Miss Amos pointed
out that the group should continue
to “give the plan a trial.”

Dean Suggests Iron

Miss Amos then voiced the opin-
ion that “artistic wrought iron
work should be erected to keep
students from leaning against the
stone in the Fifth avenue en-
trance,” since it had become black
from constant friction. She also
suggested red velvet cushions for
the stone seats in the Commons

Nominations and elections for

Over the objections of Jack Hoe-

a change in voting procedure from

Hoeveler objected on the grounds
that the action was inconsistent

Engineers Hold Spotlight

In Football lnliramurals

As, ,. intramural touch football
completes its second week, the
Engineers seem to have seized all
the glory. The fraternity boys
haven’t gone to the ﬁring line yet,
and the ROTC and Independent
Leagues are several days behind
schedule.

From their showing in the ﬁrst
two games, the Metallurgists rate
the role of the Engineering
League’s outstanding club. The
passing combinations of Mann to
Leith and Mann to Pataky have
earned the Mets two impressive
wins, 13-6 over AE & ME and 13-0
over the Chem Sophs.

However, the highest score for
one game was hung up by the Elec-
trical B team, who downed the
Chem Juniors 19-0. While a team
can not be judged on the basis of
one game, it is probable that the
Electrical B outﬁt will loom as a
very prominent stumbling block in
the Meta1lurgist’s path.

In the Independent loop, the
Newman Club holds first place
with two victories in as many
starts. Johnson and Burke were on
the scoring end of passes as the
Newman boys dropped the Chem
Specials 13-0. The second triumph
was a gift, the Orients forfeiting.

Both tennis and horseshoes have
passed through the second round
and the double elimination tourna-
ment is rushing along full blast.
The team of Bassett and Martin
looked like the class of the tourney
in their ﬁrst two matches, but
should have more than a little
trouble in stopping such combina-
tions as Rau and Kinsey or Burns
and Larimer.

Two teams have dominated the
horseshoe competition. Myer and
McArdle seem to have a slight
edge on Engh and Wyar but the
question will not be settled for
some time. The boys are in oppo-
site brackets, and will not meet un-
til the championship tilts, if at all.

Track Meet

Though not a howling success
from the point of the number of
entrants, the Seventh Annual Fall
Track Meet held last Tuesday at
the Stadium brought to light sev-
eral freshmen who look like great
prospects for Carl Olson’s varsity.

The bright light of the meet was
Bill ‘Carter who streaked 100 yards
in 10 seconds ﬁat, then followed up
with a 23.2 seconds performance
to capture first place in the 220-
yard dash. Another double winner
was Manual who jogged the two-
mile distance in 10 minutes, 31 sec-
onds, then squeezed out a win over
Smith in the 880, going the dis-
tance in 2 minutes, 14 seconds.

Bill Cooper and Len Powell took
turns winning the hurdle races.
Cooper glided over the 120-yard
high hurdles in 16.8 seconds and
took second in the 180 low while
Powell cruised in ahead on the 180
with a 23.5 seconds mark and ﬁn-
ished runner-up in the 120. Warren
Roseborough took 5 minutes, .6
seconds to win the mile, and Bob
Witoski stepped off the 440 in 54.5
seconds. Vaughn and Jessup tied
at 5 feet, 7 inches in the high
jump, the only ﬁeld event of the
day.

SM U Promises

Jam Session

Word from Dallas indicates that
a number of jam sessions are ex-
pected to take place in the Stadium
tomorrow afternoon.

First the Southern Methodist
Mustangs expect to jam the Pan-
ther oﬁense when it gets anywhere
near the SMU goal line.

In the second place, the SMU
swing Band will “get hot” in an
extra special session.

There is some question as to the
possibility of the first proposal.
About the second. there is W
doubt. Or maybe, just a little.

The doubt about the second con-
cerns whether or not the bandmen
will have their uniforms. The band
is already on its way to Pittsburgh.
It will arrive tomorrow and so will
the uniforms——COD. If the Mus-
tangs have the postage cost—some-
thing over $4000-everything will
be 0.K.

Uniforms or no uniforms, at
least there will be music——it is

rumored.

Greeks Start
Touch Grid
Play Today

It’s the old story of Greek meet-
ing Greek!

Tuesday will see the opening
game of the Interfraternity touch
football tournament with Theta Chi
meeting Delta Tau Delta, runner-
up of last year, on Trees Field at
3 o’clock. Other games listed for
Tuesday include Sigma Alpha Mu
against Phi Delta Theta at 4
o’clock and Kappa Sigma stacking
up against last year’s champs,
Lambda Chi Alpha.

The Greeks are using a different
system this year than has been
used in previous years. Instead of
the single elimination, they will
attempt the double elimination.
This system requires a team to
lose two games before dropping
out of the tournament as compared
with one defeat in the past.
Wednesday’s games ﬁnd Pi Kap-
pa Alpha mixing it with Phi Ep-
silon Pi at 3 o’clock and Phi Kaps
challenging Sigma Alpha Epsilon
at 5 o’clock. Pi Lambda Phi plays a
second round game‘ Thursday at
3 o’clock against the Theta Chi-Delt
winner. Other games scheduled for
this week list PiKa-Phi Ep victor
opposing winner of SAM—Phi Delt
contest on Friday at 3 o’clock.

Unbeaten Cross-Country A
Team Races Spartans

Coach Olson’s usual pessimism“x‘r

has just cause this week. His un-
defeated P a n t h err cross-country
team will travel to Lansing, Michi-
gan, in an attempt to bring back
their fourth victory of the season,
and Michigan State, defending In-
tercollegiate Champions, will be on
hand to make the Pitt mission an
unhappy one.

The same team that overwhelmed
Navy thinclads will make the trip,
and this will be the fourth meet on
enemy grounds. The Olsonmen
have not yet held a cross-country
meet on their home track over the
Schenley course.

Walter Sterner will continue in
the number one spot for Pitt.
Sterner led the pack home in the
last two meets against Franklin
and Marshall and Navy. Al Zam-
borski, Al Boulanger, Casimir and
Ben Kopec, Frank McCabe, and
Bill Nurmi will complete the
Lansing-bound squad. ’

Although they have kept out of
the spotlight this fall, the Panther

cross-country runners are one of
the two undefeated teams on
campus at the present moment.
They have beaten Purdue, Frank-
lin-Marshall, and Navy. And each
one of these was a decisive victory
with only two points being sur-
rendered in each one except the
Purdue run, which was a clean
sweep for Pitt.

The Spartans, known nationally
for the prowess of their hill and
dale teams, now -holds the IC4A
team and individual championship.
They were the only team that was
able to beat the Panthers last year,
and they did it on the Pitt home
grounds.

Pitt Meets

Tomorrow  

 Razzle-Dazzle
Threatens'Pantl1ers

. Up from the Southwest come the
Mustangs with a potent dose of
football razzle dazzle that may give
Goldberg,
Merkovsky, and the rest of Dr. Jock
Sut—her_land’s .undefeated Yankee
boys a bitter afternoon when the

Southern Meth_odi_st football team:
crosses goal lines tomorrow with§

Pitt's Golden Panthers
Stadium.

Matty Bel1’s
along their famed aerial circus that
will emphasize wide open football
with long passes, short passes, and
skimpy laterals pestering Pitt. To-
morrow the Panther pass defense
will ‘be given the supreme test.

The air-minded Texans will ﬁeld
a veteran team that has bulk and
speed. The forward wall, paced by
Center Ray Pope is liable to dyke
up the Panther ﬂood of touch-

downs, and force Pitt to turn to=

the airlanes.

‘Skyscraper ends Charles Sprague
and Billy Dewell, who in aggregate
touch 400 pounds on the scales,
ﬂank the Methodist line. Both
reach high and wide for ﬂying pig-
skins and make sizeable targets for
the pass heaving backs. ‘_

Both Methodist tackles are 200
pounders and_cap_able of holding up
under" "off-tackle Panther slants.

‘Tackles. Jack Sanders and Willie
~_-_-__Curik are aided and abetted by
..f.wo burly guards, Clif Matthews

and George Sanders. Coach Matty
Bell will be able to spell off his
front liners with capable reserves.

' The bad boys of the Methodist
backﬁeld are first year men, Ger-
ald Guise at left half and Ray Mal-
louf, quarter. Guise is one of those
whirling dervish halfbacks who
keeps moving forward until he’s
piled under. Mallouf punts, tosses
passes, and occasionally jaunts
goalward with the pigskin. Mal-
louf to Sprague has become Meth-
odist’s best scoring threat.

Fullback Bob Belville and right
half Nolan Jackson, both veterans,
complete the Mustang backﬁeld.
Belville- and Jackson are both
pitchers, tossing touchdown strikes
to the ends or fellow backs. The
first string Methodist backﬁeld
averages little over six feet and
make use of their height in pass-
ing and pass defense.

For the Panthers this intersec-
tional battle will be the ﬁfth.tough
battle in succession_. The Mustangs
will be well rested having had an
open date after their 7-0 loss to
Marquette two weeks ago. After
two easy triumphs against sec-
tional rivals, Southern Methodist
was dumped  Marquette in a
game "termed “upset”. Southern
Methodist, therefore, will be on the
rebound. _

Every ‘time a team wins three
or four games in succession the
coach is usually troubled with over-
conﬁdence. This past week Panther
coaches have been removing any
trace of over-conﬁdence by point-
mg out the Panther faults in the
Wisconsin melee.

Pitt kicking was poor last Sat-
urday and if Southern Methodist’s
line proves as rugged as Wiscon-
s-rn’s the Panthers may spend the
afternoon playing “out of the hole.”
Poor quarterbacking by Wisconsin
caused the Badger to lose the ball
by passing after repeated success-
ful sallies through the Pitt for-
ward wall. ‘_ 

Sutherland will reiterate with

’:the line-up that has started the

fonrearlier Pitt games. Daddjo
and Hoffman. ends; Merkovsky
and R-askowskii tackles; Lezouski
and Pet1'0o guards; and Dannies,

Holding a preliminary contest,
the varsity debate squad will meet
Tuesday, at 1:30 o’clock, in 1617
Cathedral, announces Roy H. Um-
ble, debate coach.

Four college sophomores will dis-
cuss the question “Resolved: The
United States and Great Britain
should form an alliance.” Bob Shaw
and Sam Rodgers will defend the
proposition; the negative consists
of Fred Roth and Jerry Hahn.

The purpose of this debate is to

teams for the question, which will
be debated next month before high
schools and with college groups.

Other questions to be discussed
at later dates, and for which squad

members are preparing at present.
include, “Resolved: The United
7 State government should cease us-
ing public funds to stimulate busi-
ness;” and “Resolved: All labor
unions should be incorporated.”

Meeting on the same day and at
‘ the same place, the freshman squad
will continue their discussion of the
Anglo—American alliance.

Tuesday’s News will carry an
up-to-date list of scheduled debates
before high-school audiences and
with colleges.
