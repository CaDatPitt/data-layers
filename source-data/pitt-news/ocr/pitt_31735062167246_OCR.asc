by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

(Except for this important and factual
story, concerning President Johnson’s de-
cision not to run for reelection, The Pitt
News honors humor today with its annual
April Fool’s parody issue.)

At the conclusion of a national broad-
cast, President Lyndon B. Johnson an-
nounced that he “shall not seek and will
not accept the nomination of my party for
another term for the Presidency.”

“I shall not permit the office of the
Presidency to participate in the partisan
division that is developing in this election
year,” declared the President.

With this rationale, Mr. Johnson told
the American public that he will devote
all of his remaining time in office to estab-
lish peace in Southeast Asia.

In connection with these statements,

the President has instructed Ambassador-
at—Large Harriman to attempt to set up a
conference to establish peace in Vietnam.

This new effort toward peace in Viet-
nam entails a unilateral deescalation of
the Vietnam war. Specifically, this will
include a restriction of the bombing of
North Vietnam. He stressed that the with-
drawal of American military strength
hopefully will include the mutual with-
drawal of North Vietnamese military pow-
er. If this is achieved, said the President,
“we will go anywhere to talk peace with
the North Vietnamese Government.

At the very end of his shocking state-
ment, President Johnson said that “Amer-
ica stands strong tonight; America stands
ready tonight.”

The Johnson decision raises a great
many questions of perplexity and The Pitt

News must review some of these impor-
tant considerations.

> What sort of reactions will the Hanoi
Government have to Johnson’s decision
not to run? .

> Will the decision create a favorable in-
ternational climate that could ultimately
foment a lasting peace in the embattled
area of Vietnam?

> Will the Johnson position create a new
national climate of unity that will answer
the cries for a policy of rational alterna-

‘tive concerning the Vietnam war?

>Can President Johnson’t decision not
to run for re-election be regarded as the
ultimate sacrifice for peace in Vietnam?"
> What sort of effects will Mr. Johnson’s
new position, that of a worker for peace
in Vietnam, have on the presidential can-
didacies of Senators McCarthy and Ken-
nedy?

 

, Questions Surround LB] Decision

> Specifically, what does the decisior
do to the political platform of Sen. Eugen-
McCarthy who has been an open foe to tb
Johnson Administration?

> In this new political climate, what ar
the chances of Senator Robert Kenned
for the Presidency and what effects wi?
the President’s decision have on his estal
lished positions of concern?

.> On the Republican side of the coir
how does Richard Nixon’s views fit int
this new complex state of affairs? Wi.
Mr. Nixon maintain his hawkish view
point of the Vietnam war?

These questions are unaswerable ti
day, and therefore, The Pitt News cannt
take a position on this dramatic turn <
events. A great portion of Wednesday
edition, however, will be devoted to
detailed analysis of the very questior
raised in this story.

‘Pitt News’ Staff Walks Out on Paul Stoller

MRS. KITZES defending Dean Segrams.

Police Riots Provoke

by BROTHER LOVE
Twenty-ﬁve policemen were

arrested last night by Uni-

versity students at the num-
ber four station on charges of
inciting a riot and violations
of the drug abuse laws.

“This was a shameful display
of lawlessness and anarchy,”
said Ken Schueler, who led the
students in making the citizen's
arrests of the law enforcement
officers.

‘-7 Many policemen were shout-

ing obsenities and running ram-
pant on the Oakland streets.
Traffic ca-me to a stand still as
police spilled over int-o Forbes
St. and began an assault on the
quadrangle. “Silk!” shouted one
of Pittsburgh's ﬁnest as scores
of_ them charged on Holland

sity's greatest sneak attack pan-
ty raids,” said David Baer, -an
observer who should know.
Two policemen drifted into
Winky’s and attacked Mrs. Kit-
zes, director of student publica-
tions for the University, and
Dean Sengrnms who were peace-
fully enjoying a meal. “I am sure
they were high on marijuana,"
£_lt_lI'g'(é(l Mrs. Kitzes. “I think
maybe they were only copping
speed," interjected Miss Skewis.
Under the circumstances this is
in highly believable. theory.

'24 Citizens’ Arrests

In all, 25 policemen were ar-
rested in the parity raid. They
were taken to the number four
station to be charged.

“When we got there it smell-
ed kind of funny,” said one stu-
dent. “We walked in and saw

gy Borkowski, and Mayor Barr

Staff Registers Objections,
Denounces Dictatorial Rule

by KEN “ZEUS” SCHUELER

(Editor's note: Schueler had been in an important conference on
Fraternity lmsiness with Stoller at the time of the walkout and was
therefore the only one left in the office to write this story.)

After two weeks of careful consideration, The Pitt
News staff overruled cries of “Give the guy a chance”
and voted unanimously to walk out on newly elected editor

Paul “Benito” Stoller.

“We ﬁgure it's like an im-
peachment,” said George Dies,
associate editor. “It’s about time
we took some action against the
incompetence displayed by Stol-
ler these last two weeks,” he
smiled.

“Dissolving the staff structure
was the only way to remedy the
gross inadequacies Paul Stoller
has been forcing on us since he
took over the office by false rep-
resentation,” Anne Dorn, man-
aging editor, said sweetly.

A key ﬁgure in the rebellion
was Kathy Nagy, who led the
procession out of the news room
down the hall to the elevator.
“Benito" has been repressing
needed reforms too long," Miss
Nagy screamed.

“I couldn't stand Stoller’s to-
talitarian suppression of rele-
vant news in an attempt to use

the paper for his own personal
gain,” bubbled Sheryll Zipupay,
news editor.

Ann Shirey, business mana-
ger, calculated that “Stoller im-
posed .im-poss-ibrle regulations on
the business staff by conﬁscat-
ing money from petty cash for
his frequent binges, reasoning
that the University students do
not need a paper -anyway. How
does he expect us to pay for
the booze cooler we wanted for
the office?”

Dave Tiernan, news editor,
pointed out that “Stoller em-
ploys yellow journalism techni-
ques full time. There’s a limit
to how much yellow journalism
at college newspaper should use.”

Bruce Levenson offered his
reason for walkiing out: “If I
can't be editor, no one should be
editor,” he said sulkily. ( Edi-

BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT

Pa Pitt, proud grandfather
of Mr. Pittt, has announced
that his son and daughter-in
law, the former Miss Pitt, are
the parents of a bouncing
baby. “It is big for its size,"
noted Pa Pitt. The Parents
have decided to name the
child, whose sex is as yet un-
determined, after the infam-
ous Super Pitt, football star
of the 1964-1967 seasons. Since
“Super" has been used as a
name already, the slobbering
child will be_ called “S. Pitt.”

 

Original in Oakland in hopes
that the title of the establish-
ment would serve -as inspiration
for the senators. The meeting
was originally scheduled at the
Kings Court at the request of
SG President Ken Sihoelace but
it was decided that the senators
did not need additional distrac-
tions.

Senatress Kathy C-an dy s on

moved that SG sponsor an in-
ternational affairs poll taking
up such questions as Vietnam,
Red China, and the draft.

Not one to delay action, Westy
Berner volunteered to chair the
poll committee and began call-
ing while the President's report
was being given.

As a truly dedicated Universi-
ty woman should, Senatres-s

ing of Silk Seekers, Mayhem

"canceled but will be held on
the first warm evening of

Next Miss Berner callled Ma-
jor E. Borden, head of ROTC.
“Can I have your views on Viet-
nam, sir?"

“They oughta bomb it off the
face of the eart .”

, “What about Cuba, sir?”

“They oughtta bomb it off the

“And Red China?”

“They ough a bomb -it off the

“Thank you, Major Bord-en,
sir, for your enlig-htening re-
sponses,” Senatress Berner re-
plied.

While the President mumbled
his report, Miss Berner cried,
“My fellow illustrious senators,
what do you think of the draft?”

“I’m innocent,” shouted the

-major as he threw a bottle of

Sc-agram’s at the students.

Mr. Slusser was attired in a
guru suit but was not wearing
shoes or socks. “We were just
having a friendly game out strip

poker,” he told the studenrts.

These four men were prompt- l

ly beaten over the head with a
rolled up Pitt News by Madman
Stoller. “That should teach tho-se
naughty villains!” he yelled.

All 29 men were sentenced to
a ride on the campus bus and
to sit through a University Var-

set at 25 cents a “head.” No one
posted it.

A Tearjerker

The recent walk out of The Pitt News editorial
board hascaused me to get mad. “The rath of ‘Benito’
has never been fully witnessed. But, readers of this

reply will most certainly get a glimpse of it. Let us
observe the motivations of the cu1prits——that miser-
able staff.

’> George Lies—Mr. Lies has many inherent prob-
lems that would motivate him to impeach me. Unfor-
tunately, Lies’ problem centers around delusions of
grandeur. These delusions have reached such magni-
tude lately that our staff psychologist told me that
George had become a psychotic. When Lies accepts
his fate, I will consider his reinstatement.

*> Anne Dorn——Sweetie Dorn has charged that I
took over this office of editor by means of false rep-
resentation. However, Miss Dorn doesn’t define false
representative, and therefore her point is ludicrous.

> Rebel Nagy—Miss Nagy is one the most insidious
members of the staff. She neglects everything. In fact
she is simply a terrible production editor. I was pleas-
ed when she walked out. Who needs her anyway.

>Bubbles Zippay — Bubbles was full of bubbly
when she made her charge. Every deadline, Miss Zip-

. pay is stoned out of mind on wine. Thus, her testi-

mony and subsequent statements have no rationality
or relevance.

'> Ann Shirey—Miss Shirey has insinuated that I
have been bbhfiseating money from the petty cash
box to finance my drinking binges. My reply to this
charge is that there isn’t enough money in ‘petty cash
to pay my drinking bill!

>Dave Tiernan—-Mr. Tiernan’s statement is also
inaccurate. He believes that I employ yellow journal-
ism. I consider my brand of journalism to be Red.

‘Better red than dead, an old sage once said. That's

right folks, I'm a Commie rat fink.

>Briice Levenson—Levenson has such a miniscule

intellectual capacity that I don’t have the heart to

ruin his false image.

> Roy Jacobs——For many a year, battles have raged
between the Editor and the Sports Editor. However,
Mr. Jacobs will never defeat me for I can bear any
burden, fight any foe and defeat any enemy in the
name of ‘Benito’ Stoller.

>Ivan Abrams—“Militancy breeds degneracy.” I
quite agree.

>Dan Marbury———Mr. Marbury has a terrible case
of sour grapes. Little does he know ole ‘Benito’ had
to go through the same hardships. He also doesn’t
realize that if I didn’t eat my bagles, lox and cream
cheese, I would have withered away a long time ago.

'> Barbara Markowitz—The remarks made by Miss
Markowitz have caused me to take a serious re-eval-
uation of my sense of ethics. (Ha ha) However, I
must conclude that Miss Markowitz is naive. One
doesn’t contact mononucleosis by chasing a person
around a desk. In the tale of the hunter and the hunt-
ed, the hunter always apprehends his prey, but his

. task is difficult. In the tale of Markowitz, the hunted

(Markowitz) let the. hunter catch her. Thus, the en-
ticing Miss Markowitz made her own path into the

met overwhelming threats. And I shall not be moved.

Dear Georgia-

Girls Want To Know Why Boys...

by GEORGIA OMOSEX

(With this issue of The Pitt
News, a new lovelorn column be-
gins publication. It will run on
weekdays at the expense of the
letter writers, but on weekends,
it is for free.

Dear Georgia,
Two weeks
ago, I. went to
the Greek Week
formal} My date
got completely
bombed; and so
I left with some
one else. Do you
think I did the gs
right thing?
Wanda Flee

Miss Omosex

Dear Miss Flee,
Undoubtedly you were talked
into leaving. by your girlfriend;

otherwise you would have stayed. ,

I think your action was wrong.
But you’ll probably cop out on
life again anyway.

Dear Georgia,

My boyfriend gave me a dia-
mond ring for our engagement.
Then he asked, “Can we go to
bed now?” What should I do?

Future Bride

  

Dear Future Bride,

Your fiance has a rather ex-
pensive “line.” But -my advice to
you is to- put him off as long as
you want. Then when you're tired
of the ring, return it to him with
deep regret.

Dear Georgia,
I have three boyfriends. Two

, of them are pretty much even; if

one asks me, I go along. I keep
score, and I keep the other one
posted on the running score. My
problem is the third boy. He loves
me and wants to marry me. Can
you help me?
Eva Nite

Dear Miss Nite,
Yes, meet me tonight at 8:30
p.m. at Edwards.

Dear Georgia,

I ’m really hurting. I ’m a sopho-
more coed, I have 16 quarter
hours left for the month, and to-
day is the last day of the month.

-» I want to find out why no one

dates me; I’m enclosing a photo-

Dear Miss Knead.
Look in the mirror. That’s why.

Dea/r Georgia,

I ’m a commuter. And every day
on the Fifth Avenue bus, I see
this girl. I love this girl. But
she doesnt even know my name.
Could you give me some advice?

Pat Dayhop

Dear Mr. Dayhop,

As a start, why don’t you buy,

her a, monthly bus pass. Then if
you still feel the same way, and
if she still takes the same bus.
maybe you could get the bus driv-

er to rope-off a specially reserved

seat for you two.

Dear Georgia,

I am afraid I have an extreme
latent drive. I just love girls.
They always get the best grades
in the English classes I teach.
My problem is that the girls
don’t believe my sincerity. What
can I do?

Dr. May Tab

Dear Dr. Tab

Why not try the boys. And if
that doesn’t work Gut, call 621-

Frank Carver Resigns, Succeeded By Pookum

Former All-American
Assumes Duties Today

by TD! SEX »

In an unpredicted and heretofore unimaginable move,
Frank Carver, under pressure, has announced his resigna-
natiom as athletic director. He is to he succeeded as of today by
Peter J. Pookum, former All-American halfback, baseketball for-

by the ECAC Board of Presi-
de.nts with operating an illegal
slush fund and has thereate.ned
the school with .immediate puni-
tive action as soon as the facts
have been gathered.

The charge was prompted -the
resign-ation of Ritt Athletic Di-
rector «Frank Carver. Wh-en be-

 ing questioned, Carver denied
’ ,knowing that slush funds were
.illeg‘~a.l.

- “Th-e weather in Pittsburgh is
at-rocious,” he began, “and dur-

ing the winter time the-re is of-

ten a tremendous amount of
snowfall in the city. As Trees
Hall and Fitzgerald Field House
are s'i.tu=ated at the top of sev-
eral hills, the dlrivineg to and

7 from work is -extremely dan-
"gerous under these conditions.

“I see no reason, therefore,”
continued Carver, “why the
athletic department can't set a
fund to provide for the removal
of snow and slush from the side-

Awalks and streets. We take ex-

treme pains to see that no ath-
lete be hired to clear the walks,

lest he receive money from the
slush fund. *

“As I understand the issue,”
added Carver, leaving the situa-
tion wide open for debate, “we
are being penalized for looking
after the welfare of our athletic
personnel, be they players,
coaches, or sports information
directors. I just don’t under-
stand how such -a benelﬁrciall fund
can be illegal.”

Apparently they are. Just be-
ing associated vwith the word
slush squashes the athletic de-
p~artment’s plea of innocence.

’ Heads will roll _ probably in

some unshoveled snow.

Pookum Gives
Redshirting OK

One of the first announce-
ments made by new Arthlletic
Director Peter J. P-ookum
shocked a lot of «people in
the athletic department. It
shock-ed representatives from
Penn State, Syracuse, and
VVest Virginia. And it shock-
ed the Pitt News reporter,
mainly because he was dumb
enough to stick his ﬁnger in
a light bulb socket.

Pookum approved treds'hirt-
ing. A

“I see no reason why not
to redshirt,” said the new
» A. D. “Just rbeczause a school's
colors are blue and gold, does-
n't mean it can't wear red
jerseys when they compete
in intercolleg.iate athletic
contests. I think the color red
is prettier and more dynamic.

Welty Tabbed By Lewis;
Will Pitch For M itters

‘ 0

by I. HERL
Sam Welty, an unemployed American draft dodger,
who pitches pennies for a living at his favorite street cor-
ner on the North Side, was hired yesterday by the baseball team.

“We need his talents,” explained baseball coach Bobby Lew-

is desperately. “We need bats.”

Lewis was referring to the ex-
pensive ‘trip the and his team
took to California two weeks
ago.

“We not only Spent all of our
money,” cried Lewis, “but we
also broke all of our bats.”

Lewis’ plan is to economize.
He is willing to substitute Louis-
ville Sluggers for cheapter bats
made in Japan. And that's
where Welty ﬁt.s into the ‘pic-
ture.

“Sam has been pitching pen-
n-ies since -he's so high,” said
Lewis, standing on a la lder with
his hand raised slightly above
the Trees Hlall roo-f. “He knows
his business. Last week, Sam
broke his own individunal record
by winning $9.34 in one week!”

The plan is for Welty to visit
Japan and pitch against the top
penny pitchers in the Japanese
Bat Manufacturing Company.
Welty will be given ‘three rolls
of pennies for his traveling ex-
penses, despite the draft-dodg'er’s
insistance that he only needs
two rolls.

If Wclty wins, he is instructed

to buy the Japanese bats. The.

baseball team is hoping that the

ace will pitch at his normal 

 
 

wooden nickel this year if he

-a cup of coffee for three meals
a day, all of last year, and then
some.

In any case, however, the bats
will be considerably cheaper in
quality and smaller in size.

When asked how small the
bats will be, Lewis replied hesi-
tately, “No smaller than tooth-
picks.”

Terms of Welltyls un-official
contract were not disclosed. It
is rumored that Welty is doing
it for only meal money.

“I won't sign any contracts,”
Welty admitted. “I want to be
considered unemployed, and a
contract would ruin my image.”

“Besides,” the dedicated pitch-
er continued, “Pitchers aren't
supposed to accept money for
playing; that’s college rules,
isn't it?”

Welty is uneducated, but «he
has won the MVPP for the last
three years in succession.

“I’m proud of that,” -boasted
VVe1ty foolishly. “Each year the
MVPP is awarded to the most
valuable penny pitcher in the
country.”

However, Welty is the only
Penny pitcher on official rec-
ords, and he won't be worth a

 

forward, and phantom aardvark.

Pookum leaves his job at US
Steel to return to the sports
limelight after a 37-year ab-
sence. He formerly coached at
Philadelphia Textile, Valpariso
State, and Rensselkae-r Polytech-
nic Institute. However, he nev-
er held any of the jobs long
enough to compile any sort -of
won-lost record. -He has no ex-
perience as an athletic directotr.

“I know in my heart that
Pookyum is the night man to
step into my position,” conﬁded
Carver to an unidentiﬁed source.
“His lack of -experience will only
cause him to bring a new fresh-
ness to the jo .” ,

Carver chose not to elaborate
on the reasons for his resigna-
tion, but instead welcomed the
press to meet Pookum at a.
luncheon in his honor at Win-
ky’s. Many of the local sports
ﬁgures were there, and the
praise for the new AD was sur-
prisingly wide-spread:

D “He’s the only hawk -I know
who walks like a due ,” com-
mented Horse Czarnecki, who
was on his lunch break. “But
why does he smile all the time?”

|>“'I’m sort of sorry to see
Mr. Carver go,” remarked Jay
“Ella-tbu-s'h” Rosens-tein, former
sports editor of the Pitt News.
“He always seemed -like a ﬁx-
ture around here. You know,
like the Cathedral. But judging
by Mr. Pookum’s credential's,
he'll keep u:s moving in the same
direction.”

.‘> Pookum’s my kind of man,”
offered baseball coach Bobby
Lewis. “He's the only person I
know who wouldn't buy a. raffle
ticket."

And that's just a sampling.
Telegrams poured in from all
over the count-ry congratulating
Pookum and wishing Oarverthe
best of luck -in retirement. The
University switchboard was so
busy that Chancellor Posvar
couldn't even be notiﬁed that the
State was putting the Cathedral
up for sale.

Of course, Pookum’s ﬁrst task
was to make a statement to the
press. Because -of overwhelming
-student interest, it is repeated,
in part, here:

“Let me say, ﬁrst, that this
appointment came as a. pleasant
surprise to me. I only hope my
limited experience doesn't set
the athletic program too far
back.

“As for some of the ideas I
expressed in my interview that
I plan to institute, let me say,
I think a big-time football school
can easily operate with 15 or
less scholarships a year. I plan
to close down ’llrees Pool be-
cause it presents a hazzard to
the children of Oakland.

“Furthermore, the bIasket’bal1'

team can operate without a
coach—a.-s it has shown in the
past; so I plan to send Mr. Ridl
back to Westminster. And finial-
ly, since coach Adams «has shown
that wrestling can be a topnotch
sport around here, I plan to
eliminate it from the program."

The new athletic director has
served notice that he intends to
make Pittsburgh, Pooku-In calm.

     

   
 

Ready For Football Season
Construction Okayed For Pitt Stadium Dome

by TEX MAUL

In a secret meeting held
last week in the dark room
domains of Horse Czarnecki’s
office, the Athletic Planning
Commission has decided to put
a dome over Pitt Stadium in
time for the 1968 football sea-
son.

Speaking for the committee
of ﬁve, Athletic Director Frank
(Smiles) Carver, in his last of-
ﬁoial act before being replaced
by Peter J. Pookum, rellelaised
the following statemenrt:

“Due to the tardiness in the
planning and construction of the
much talked about North [Side
Stadium, the University has de-
cided to take a step in the night
dlireotion for the improvement
of Pitt athletic conditions."

According to the chief engi-
neer of the project, Horse (‘Jar-
necki, the dome will be com-
posed of plastics, produced by
the Benjamin Braddock Plastics,
Inc., of Los Angeles.

“Under the dome,” continued
Hons-e between checker moves.
“We willl utilize a type of Astro-
tu-rf, called >P~anther—sod, which
will be made through the joint
efforts of the Engineering and
Chemistry departments in order
to insure its quality.”

Speaking for the coaches, head
fiootball coach Dave Hart indi-
cated that his team’s perform-
ance will probably increase by

“With the dome, our kick-off
and punt return men should be
able to go all the way, now that
the sun won’t ‘interfere in their
catching and holding on to the
ball.

“Also, I can’t forsee any drop-
ped passes by the ends now
that the last of their excuses is
gone,” said Hart deﬁantly.

 

Head soccer coach Leo Be-
mis also expressed joy with the
University's decision. “Now, my
boys won’t have to slip and slide
over a bare ﬁeld while trying to
find the right goal,” said Bem-its.

Bemis also envisions many
new and exciting features that
he can add to the intramural
program in order to spice the
activities of the non-varsity ath-
lete.

 
 
  

THE MOLD for Pitt Stadium’s new plastic dome is shown under

construction at White Plains, New Mexico. The mold will be

shipped to Los Angeles for dome construction, and the dome will
then be frisbeed to Pittsburgh.
