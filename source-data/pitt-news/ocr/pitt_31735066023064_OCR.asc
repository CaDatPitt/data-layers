Los Angeles Rams, the campus
police expect to have their hands

Student Government Board members (from lelt) Martlm Bertocci, Walter Burke, and Janice Faller and president Bill

Chancellor Disappointed

Over Reccomendotion

Chancellor Wesley Posvar ex-
pressed disappointment over the
state board of education’s budget
recommendations for Pennsylvan-

-ia's state related universities-—

recommendations forwarded last
week to Gov. Dick Thomburgh.

The board recommended a 5.9

A percent increase in funding for Pitt,

Penn State, Temple, and Lincoln
universities, while providing for a

/

one percent increase for the state
owned colleges.

Posvar said although he and his
administration will actively pursue
greater appropriations (as they
have in past years) he is not
optimistic that such an increase will
come to pass.

Dr. Frank Slaughter, of the
Mathematics department ex-
pressed his concern over the
probable forthcoming department-

Pitt News Stafl"Writcr

The Student Government Board
yesterday approved an amended
set of guidelines for conducting this
year’s allocation process yesterday
at the new board’s first meeting.

The recommended priority list
accepted was presented. to the
board by Kerry L. Warren,
chairperson of the allocations
committee. ’

This year priorities fall in two
categories: 1) programming and 2)
supplies, according to Warren.

“The reason for the two
categories is the way the budgets
are presented. The budgets are
presented with programming first,
supplies second, so we have listed
the priorities in this manner,” said
Warren.

The social programming priority
was the first major point of

controversy among the board.

The point stated “more consider-
ation will be given to those
organizations which have utilized
the opportunity of PUPC before
coming to the boar .” .

_ “The point of moreconsideration

., should be a strong recommenda-
tion through the liason not a’

stipulation,” said SGB-l president
Bill Abraham. ‘- V
Board member Alan Mele said
Abraham had no valid point. p
Warren said that making the
“more ' consideration” point a
recommendation wouldnot work.
“We have many times in the
past recommended and "stressed

schools. Seen here he discusses it with Provost Rhofen Smith-

/

al budget problems resulting from
the low appropriations.

Slaughter cited the lack of
compliance with what he-believed
to be some
projections in the early days of the
Thomburgh administration” pro-
jections that lead many at the
university to believe that under
Thomburgh some budgetary help
would be on the way.

‘ ‘more optimistic ‘

will travel toharrisburg Tuesday to «

discuss the budget recommenda-
tions.

“I_can’t justify or defend it ,(the
poor funding recommendations
under Thomburgh) but I'm sure

my colleagues and I will take a_

critical position when we meet with
these people face to face,” Posvar
said. » ' .

Posvar also cited the promises of
increased funding made by the

\

organizations use PUPC but they
just ignore us,” said Warren.

After a lengthy discussion the
board voted 6-3 in favor of leaving
the “more consideration” point in
as astipulation. ‘

Two points discussed at length
and amended unaniumously were
the ﬁnancial stipulations were
changed to strong recommenda-
tions and Greek Week would be
budgeted by IFC and Panhellenic
Association. '

The new business which the
board voted on was the proposal to
increase the Student Activities fee

‘for all full and part time day

undergraduate students at Pitt.
The proposal was drawn up by the

Task Force on Student Activities -

fee and presented by Cindy
DeMatteo to the board.

Abraham announced there would
be an office management proce-

‘dure change because of personal

phone calls and improper dialing
procedures, which resulted in $135
worth of illegal phone usage.

The board also voted to accept
the two new members and the two

new alternatives to -the allocation..?"c

committee. The new members are
Kevin Marina and Kristine Mes-
sner and the alternates are Lisa
Schriber and Vincent Ashoff.

The legal awareness committee
presented a .'list of their new
ofﬁcers to the board‘for ratiﬁcation.
The new officers are: chairperson
Mary Curiale, co-chairperson Todd
DeLucca, secretary-Linda Seguino
and treasurer-Mike Langer.

The U.S. is using the Soviet
presence in Afghanistan as a way
to re-establish its prestige as a
global power, according to an
Afghani student at Pitt.

Mohammed H. Sidky, a Ph. D.
candidate in the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA), claims the U..S. is in no
hurry _to see an end to the
Afghanistan situation. Instead, the
government is using Afghanistan
so‘ the ,“Cold War people can crawl
out from under their rocks,” he

fetid.

Sidky‘ addressed about 100
people yesterday, in the GSPIA
lounge in Forbes Quadrangle. The

talk, “Afghansitan: Behind the
Propaganda,” was organized by
GSPIA’s International Develop-
ment Forum.

“Journalistic creativity” and
propaganda techniques by the U.S.
government have been used to
distort what is actually taking place
in Afghanistan, Sidky said.

Sidky said the Soviet~Union did
not have colonialistic intentions
when it entered Afghanistan late
last month. He claimed that the
Khalq (People’s) party of Afghan-
istan ousted and executed Presi-
dent Haﬁzullah Amin. Afterward,
according to Sidky, Soviet troops
were called into the area by the
Khalq party to/‘stabilize’-’ the new

government in accordance with a ‘

the Soviet and Afghani govern-
ments in December 197_8.

At the same time the /Khalq was
preparing for Amin’s overthrow,
Afghanistan was in the—process of
receiving other “Soviet assist-
ance,” said Sidky.

When Amin was ousted, the
“warhawks” of the U.S.’ govern-
ment linked the two events as a
way to create a A “Communist
conspiracy,” basing their accounts
of the Soviet presence on “ﬂimsy
evidence” instead of fact, said
Sidky. The subsequent entry of
additional Soviet military into
Afghanistan——which occured at the
request of the Afghani govern-
ment, according to Sidky—gave,

further credence to the U.S.’s
theory of Soviet expansionism.

“People come up to me and say
they’re _sorry about what's hap-
pening in my country,” Sidky said.
“They don't understand (the
situation) because they’re misin-
formed.” ‘

Most of the. information journa-
lists are receiving about the
situation in Afghanistan is coming
from the rebel‘ forces ‘in neigh-
boring countries, said Sidky. Since
these rebels were displaced from
Afghanistan under" a previous
regime and are interested in as-

information the media has received

Tax Reformers Are I  rning- Battle ;
Stars and Notching A Victory. T e  

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—-Tax reformers
are earning their battle- stars and
notching an occasional victory in
their drive for a Proposition
13-style revolution in Pennsylvan-
ia. ‘

After pushing a constitutional
amendment to limit state spending

_ through the House at the end of the

year, the insurgents are turning to
the Senate. A hearing on the
proposal is set for Thursday.

Still pending in both houses are
bills to reform the prgperty t_ax,
abolish lqcal nuisance taxes and
permit citizens to enact or block
legislation through initiative and

. referendum.

“The power to tax, which has
been so abused by legislators, must
be controlled by those who foot the
bill,”' said Paul Pazery, recently
elected chairman of the Concerned
Taxpayers of Pennsylvania. -.

‘Although outgunned by such
powerful forces as‘ local govem-
ments, the taxpayer groups are
gathering strength for thesiege.

“The problem has been that
although many citizens feel strong-
ly about taxes,

taxpayers,” said James Ferrence,‘
head’ of the Pennsylvania Tax
Limitation Committee. “In ‘a
sense, we have no voice.”

‘His group is building alliances

with other taxpayer and business

organizations a\nd is nfoving
towards hi'ring\a paid lobbyist.

“We’re trying to rally groups

behind a more speciﬁc area rather. .

than just being for it in a benign‘
“We need active
support rather than inactive...It
will have tohappen quickly or it's
obvious it will all fade away.” '

which must pass in two legislative
sessions, would cap state spending

,Ferrence said his forces are
looking beyond Proposition 13, the
1978 California referendum that
limited property taxes.

“We think there’s been a change ,,

of ‘thinking nationwide for consider-
ing the alternative to limit all

said. ' .

NORFOLK, Va.—-The navy re-

0' versed its decision to station two

female helicopter pilots aboard the
oiler USS Kalamazoo because of
laws banning women from serving
in possible combat zones, Navy
officials said Tuesday.

Karen Thornton would have
become the first women ever to ﬂy

WASHINGTON—-—“Do you know
where you are today?” the attorney
asked the gaunt and wrinkled
congressman on the witness stand.
“I don’t know what you mean,”
veteran Rep. Daniel Flood an-
swered softly. .

“Do you know where you are
today?” Alex Kleiboemer repeated
loudly. - A .- ,
a After a pause, Flood lsfared
intently and whispered his ahswer: .
“Washington, D.C.” I

And so after a year of almost
constant hospitalizaion, Flood, 76,

emerged .Tuesday to . help ‘\his '

attorneys try to prove he is

They are assigned to Helicopter
Combat Support Squandron 6 in
Norfolk and ﬂy CH-46 helicopters,
twin-engine, 83-foot long aircraft
used in refueling missions and
hauling cargo from ship to ship. _
They would have joined the
Norfolk-based Kalamazoo in April.

Atlantic Fleet spokesman Lt.
John Alexander said the decision to
send the women to the Kalamazoo

was made initially at _a junior staff A‘
mobile logistics support ship, like a

level during planning stages.

once-powerful and shrewd Flood
ﬁelded questons from his attorney

whether the congressman—a form-
er Shakespearean actor—could-be

‘ playing the greatest role of his life.

_ When Kleiboemer asked:
“What year is this?” Flood’s
response drew loud snickers.

unaware of the out-of-state and

According to Ziccardi and

  Navy Reverses Decesion To Station Females

‘ That decision was recently
reviewed by the Vice Adm. George
E.R. Kinnear, commanding ofﬁcer
of the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air
Force, and Atlantic Fleet Com-
mander Adm. Harry D. Train 11.
“It was readily evident that it
conflicted both with the secretary
of the Navy’s instructions and
guidelines concerning utilization of
women,” Alexander said.

it was.

When Kleiboemer continued the
line of simple ' questions, Flood
interrupted him several times with
frustration in his voice.

‘‘Why do you keep asking me
these kinds of questions? You
never said you were going to do
this to me,” Flood said. . '
C The -Wilkes-Barre congressman,
dressed in a light blue suit, sat

chair. His trademark, a sharply
waxed, moustache, was also at
attention. ’ ’

'-Flood, whom doctors have

combatant ship is normally is
assigned to areas involving a
combat environment. Stationing
women aboard such ships perman-
ently is contrary to laws ‘restricting
the assignment of Navy women.

Another problems, Alexander
said, was the Kalamazoo’s long
Mediterranean deployment, since
the guidelines allow women to be
assigned only tempora1;ily—up to
180 days—to combatant or support
ships. . '

The Navy said the Kalamazoo

queries coherently only to‘ falter
when pressed for details.

He knew the basic federal
charges against him, but couldn’t

remember the possible legal‘

penalty. He remembered several
faces in the courtroom, but forgot
the matching names. p

A former lawyer, Flood knew
there are 12 persons on a jury; but
he couldn’t remember‘ how many

 Ready For
it  The

The January 11 issue of The Pitt News featured the
“Chancellor’s Message—Pitt’s Progressive Past
Readies University for the l980’,” Chancellor
Posvar’s prediction of Pitt’s future ‘in the new
decade.

His message, on the faceof it, is that the university
must adjust to “continued inflation, coupled with
declining educational markets and fiscal constraints”
which will be characteristic of the ’80s. The
institution, according to Posvar, will respond to the
predicted problems by’ expanding its programs,
‘modernizing university facilities through renovation
and new construction, and involving itself iﬁ research

that will meet the world’s current and future needs.

It appears the/'university’s administration is well
prepared to meet the demands of any research
institution during a period of change. That is, to
adjust research programs as the needs of society
dictate. I ’

However, there seems to be an unwritten,

underlying theme of Posvar’s message indicating that

the role of students and their position on the

administrative priority list at the university will '

ir_itell'i’gence and others. In order to conduct such .

research, financial resources and faculty manpower
must be committed to these programs. Obviously,
with funds dwindling due to inflation, more research
projects (needing those funds), the student’s needs
will be neglected.

Although Posvar listed several areas of study that
will attract students, where will the faculty and funds
come from to support these programs?

One obvious answer is tuition. The skyrocketing_,
costs of higher education coupled with Posvar’§5»

prediction of Pitt’s_ future will result in higher
tuit'ion.m, Hence, students attracted to certain
programs may lose their interest“, because of
unaffordable tuition fees.

Posvar also failed to mention the future of the

-Student Affairs division at the university. Year after

year, Student Affairs, budget cuts have hampered

student‘ services, extracurricular activities, and

programming. A - bleak financial future (due to
soaring inﬂation) will most certainly result in further
cuts in the Student Affairs area. . '
Pitt’s future, according to Posvar, seems to lie in
its research function. However, as a well-rounded

The funny thing is that it all
started out so innocently when I
was very youngx In fact, I don't
think I was even in grade school

‘yet.

There used to be a small dairy
store down the road from where I
lived that had a couple ‘ of
bubblegum machines. I remember
pumping penny after penny into
those machines. Not to get at the
bubblegum, I wanted those little
trinkets that were scattered about,
inside the machines.

That got boring fast. It was so
easy to accumulate those little
plastic ﬁgures. It had just become
a matter of having enough pennies.

It was with the next rung of the
ladder, that I started to feel the
pain of my addiction. I soon dis-
covered pinball machines and all
the glamor that surround them.

No longer was“ I pumping
pennies, it was dimes and as time
passed, .quarters. Dollar after

matter. I had to have my daily fix. V

Then it happened, the onslaught

with more sophisticated games.
Fast~paced video games, that at

Here's how to eliminate 18 hours ~

of study time each week.

If your study technique is typical, you spend 26
hours each week buried in your bools. 66-2/3%
of this study time is wasted on an antiquated set
of procedures. Procedures that have remained

_ unchanged forover a hundredyears

What’s worse,  there is nothing
you can do to improve. The prevailing attitude
on campus is “You eitha‘-have it or you don’t!”

What nonsense!

Any student with average intelligence can im
prove his reading and study skills at least 3
times with a) better techniques, b) ecpert coach-
ing, and c) controlled practice.. And he can do it
quickly-in time to dramatically increase his
grades in the current semester .

this is precisely what the Evelyn Wood
course offers, and backs it up with an iron-clad,
no’-nonsense, written guarantee.

'l‘HEGUARAN'l'EE  

. Any ‘student who attends every Evelyn Wood

class, completes the required practice, yet does
not improve reading and study skills at least 3
times will be eligible to receive a-full tuition refund.

Read Slowly?

Most students have no idea what their reading
ability is. If they are typical, they read about 300
words per minute (or onepage of a novel). Why
is it that students read at virtually the same speed,
considering how very different they all are?

The cause can be traced back to the First
Grade. When we were taught to read, we‘were
asked to read out loud, word-byword. Later, in
the Second Grade, we were asked to stop saying

* each word out loud. But we never really did. Fact

is, you're saying these words right now——not out
loud, but to yourself, one word at a time!

I This means you read only as fast as you talk-
about 250 to 300 words per minute. (As if to
prove the poi nt, Guiness’s Book of World Records
lists John F. Kennedy as delivering the fastest
speech ever at 327 words per minute).

How Do You Learn To Read
Faster? With The Same
Comprehension?

At the Mini-Lesson you will ﬁnd out how the
Evelyn Wood course eliminates the habit of read-
ing only one word at a time. How you can learn
to read 3 or 4 words instead of only one. To see
how natural this is, look at the dot in the middle
of this phrase: I

the grass - is green

Try as you may you can’t help but see the-
other words. With training, you learn to use this '

natural, but un—used potential. You learn to see
groups of words simultaneously This will double,
triple, possibly quadruple your present ability

Foul Weather

' DES MOINES, Iowa-Every
four minutes, for more than
half an hour, the forecast on the
national Weather Service’s local
FM radio station was followed
by a" salty expletive.

- “It was very unfortunate and'
we’re very embarrassed,” said
Des Moines Office chief Perry
Baker. “It was a real goof and
we’re sorry it happened.”

Baker said the forecaster
making the tape for broadcast
Sunday made a mistake in the
recording, tried to correct and
then cursed.

“He thought he had it erased,
but he was making two tapes at
the same time and the words got
on the second tape,” Baker
said.

The weather service
broadcasts -forecasts
continuously on tape loops that
repeat the information about
every four minutes.‘ Baker said
someone in the office noticed
the remark after it had run
about 40 minutes.

Baker declined to name the
forecaster.

Hotel Up For Grabs
LYONS, Mich.—The historic

Red Brick Hotel in the central
Michigan village of Lyons will

be given away if anybody wants ‘

it.

There are a few strings
attached. '

The prospective ‘owner must
have the expertise and money to
restore the mid—l9th century

'building, which has been

condemned by the Ionia County
health department. And the
property must be developed
within a time period set by the
village, which also can impose
certain restrictions regarding its
use. ' "

If anyone interested meets
those requirements, they can
have the three-story brick hotel,
two adjacent lots and 12 years

 of tax breaks.

The village has run
newspaper ads in Michigan,
New York and Chicago seeking
possible owners. .

Short Tenn Ofﬁoe

COSHOCTON, Ohio-—New-
ly elected Coshocton city
council member John Roller

. lasted just 15 minutes in office.

. Roller is a bookkeeper in the

_ city garage. He discovered after

the election that because he

works for the city, he can’t

serve on the council.

So after being sworn in
Monday night at the first
council meeting of the year, he
resigned. The council
appointed Leland Cooper, the
opponent Roller defeated in
November, as his replacement.

The Buckley Amendment is
designed to protect the privacy of
students. In order to do so, these
provisions are binding on the
University:

——Individual student records
include only information necessary
and relevant to the educational
purposes of the institution.

—Student records are open for
inspection by students :or their

parents. upon’ request, with the
exception that letters of recommen-
dation written prior to January 1.
1975, remain conﬁdential. Addi-
tionally, specific documents that
students have waived their right to
inspect remain conﬁdential.

—Students have a ‘right to
challenge the accuracy of records.

—The institution may not release
student records outside the institu-

tion without student consent,

unless one of several exceptions
applies.

—Requests external to the insti-
tution for information regarding
students, should be documented, as
should releases of ' student infor-
mation.

—The University may establish
categories of information known as

“Directory Information” and re-
lease this information upon request-

by individuals external to the
institution. This may be done only _
after students are provided the 5“
opportunity to request exclusion
from the Directory.”

information regarding exceptions

Just one short week ago,
when the Panthers were hitting
jump shots against George
Washington as easily as Towers
cafeteria oatmeal sticks to your
ribs, boisterous Pit_t fans
spotted Duquesne basketball
coach Mike Rice sitting at the
press table.

With the game just about
wrapped up, and the Panthers
on the road Saturday, some of
the crowd looked to the team’s
next home contest and began to
chant, “We Want Duquesne.”

Rice and Rutgers coach Tom
scouting the
game——were then the recipients
of patter such as, “We want
Rutgers, we want Duquesne,”

land someone cried out to a

man sitting near the coaches,
“Hey you, do you have a team?
We’ll play them! ”. B

OK fans, you’ve

The Dukes enter tonight’s
game at Fitzgerald Field House
with an excellent 10-2 record
and a 2-0 lead in the Eastern

’ Eight. Prior to Saturday’s loss

to Maryland (which counted in

. the BAA standings), Pitt had

been the league leader.
The 9-3 Panther would like
nothing better than to extend

 

     

their recent winning streak over
Duquesne, but even if both
teams were winless, tonight’s
game would probably still be a
sellout. Forget Point Park and
CMU for now, this is the city
championship series in the City
of Champions. Last season’s
matchups were both contests
where emotions ran at high
speed, particularly the first
game, a Pitt win at the Civic
Arena. v
Many of the standouts have
returned. For the visitors,
leading scorer Baron “B.B.”
Flenory and forward Bruce
Atkins provide the Dukes with
scoring from both outside and

inside. Flenory, not exactly a
favorite among opposing
crowds because of his

occasional tendency to imitate
Oscar Mayer, scored 31 points
against Holy Cross Monday
night in his team’s 103-88
victory.

“Holy Cross wasn’t really a
bad ballclub at all,” pointed out
Pitt assistant coach ' Fran
Webster. “Duquesne showed
once again that it’s a _ great
running team.” '

The Dukes will also be tough
to stop inside, and that’s where
Atkins ﬁgures in the picture.

Saturday’s Pitt—Maryland basketball game was dictated by
erratic officiating, which definitely took something away
from the contest. Maryland, incidentally, won the game, 95-
88. '

It’s a shame that a sport as popular as college basketball is
plagued by_ refereeing that is, at times, so bad and so
inconsistent that it deters from the play of the game.

’ Saturday’s game was an example of shoddy refereeing.

Basketball is a physical game, and is possibly the toughest
sport to control. The Maryland game was a physical,
brawling type of contest in which Pitt’s starting team fouled
out. It is not'uncommon for Pitt. to be in physical, tough

~ games, due to the fact that its best player, Sam Clancy is a
rough and tough performer. It is an injustice however, when
Maryland goes to the free throw lines 40 times and Pitt. is
awarded a measly nine chances. Talk about hometown calls.

Buck Williams, a burly 6’9 forward for the T-erps, threw
more elbows than Terry Bradshaw throws touchdown passes,
but nevertheless was charged with only 2 fouls. Williams
nearly decapitated both Pitt guards, (Wallace and Neverson)
and yet the officials were unattentive. a

Last week, Iona played against Georgetown and it was the
small school’s first appearance on T.V. The game, however,
was over in the first three minuteswhen the refs called 3 fouls
on Iona’s star center Jeff ‘Ruland. The calls were
questionable but killed any hope of an Iona win.’ It really was
another point of how overanxious refs can interfere with the
flow of the game. A _

There is really no solution for the problem of ogrie-sided
officiating, but for the time being, the statistics speak for
themselves. A I in — ‘ A ”  ‘ ’

- Pitt News Sports Editor

The Pantherette gymnastics
team is looking forward to revenge
Friday when they travel to
Michigan State for a dual meet with
the Spartans. Pitt will also face
Eastern Michigan Sunday on this
road trip.

“The girls are really up for it,”
said coach Donna Sanft. “Because
of our budget, we can’t travel to a
lot of schools that are close to our
level of competition, like Nebraska,
Louisville and Louisiana State.

“Sure, it’s nice to have Penn
State come up here,” she
continued, “but they are six or
seven points, above our level. We
need the kind of competition that
(11—th ranked) Statewill give us to
help prepare for regionals and
nationals. The meet will probably
come down to tenths of points.”

As Sanft noted, it is nice to have
Penn State come here once a year
and the more than 2,000 fans that
showed upfor the meet Saturday
agreed. However, the Panther-
ettes .didn’t think that thejfinal
score was so “nice” as they went
down to defeat 142.30-134.55. The
Pitt score sets a new record for the

‘ team since the new scoring system

was‘ instituted two years ago.-
Some highlights of the meet for
Pitt include.the vaulting of Holly

Martino and Roxann Evans and the

floor routines of Bonnie Tressler
and Martino. In the vault, Martino
scored an 8.9 and Evans had an
8.85. They placed fourth and ﬁfth,
respectively, behind Penn State’s
Ann Carr (9.2), Lisa Ingebretzen
(9.0) and Jan Anthony (9.15).
Coach 1 Sanft was disappointed
with the scores that the Panther-

ettes received in the vaulting and‘

said she felt it affected the entire
meet. ' . ’ 

r

“After we saw Anthony score a
9.15, I told Roxann and Holly ‘this'
is great, you’ll score well.’ After
they both did their vaults and I saw
the scores they received, I couldn’t
believe it,” Sanft said. “It was a
real let down and affected our
uneven bar routines. That is why
we fell behind so much so early.”

In the ﬂoor exercise, Tressler
placed third with an 8.9 and
Martino was fourth with an 8.8.
Another respectible performance
was turned, in by Evans who, inher
first competition in the ﬂoor
exercise since her injury, ‘scored an
8.4. Carr and teammate Marcy
Levine tied for first in the event,
both scoring 9.1. "Levine was last
year’s national champion in the
ﬂoor exercise.

V Evans had Pitt’s highest score in
the unevens, an 8.6, while Tressler
(8.65) and freshman Babble Flock
(8.6) topped the Pantherettes in

the balance beam. Carr was first in"

the unevens with a 9.0 while
"Ingebretzen took the beam with at
9. 1 , — followed closely by" teammates
Levine (9.0) and Carr (8.8).

Penn State swept the top three

~ honors in the all-around,_with Carr

topping the field.  36.1 total.
Ingebretzen was second *
(35.7) and Levine third (35.4).

’" Pitt’s Evgns, in her first all-around

competition of the season was the '

high scorer for the Pantherettes,
placing fourth with 34.2 points.
Martino had 33.7. . ‘- ’
_“Thel meet /wasn’t a big

I

hit our highest score despite’

making a lot of mistakes. We really
can’t afford to make those mistakes
‘against Michigan State.”

In sharp . contrast to Sanft’s

umbledlBy PSUI, MeetMichigan St.  

was Pitt men’s coach Frank.‘.‘_"

D’Amico’s. ‘He was disappointed
and didn’t mince words in
describing that disappointment.

“I wasn’t at all satisﬁed with our
performance, especailly in the high
bar and sidehorse,” ' he said.
“Only one of our guys hit on the
high bar and.no one did well-on the
horse.. We actually had only one
routine without any major breaks
on the horse.”

D’Amico also wasn’t impressed
with the Penn State team.

.“Penn State looked very bad,”
“I’d say they were ‘tiff?

State in 10 or 12 years.”
According to the coach, the
Pnathers’ spirits remained high
throughout the meet.
“That was ‘a tough thing to
do-—to ,keep«'our attitude good,”

_ said D’Amico. “It’s hard to keep

pushing when they (PSU) just hit
on routine after routine.”

Several Panthers - did come
through with tough routines in the
ﬂoor exercise, vault- and rings.

In the floor, Joe Femiani scored a
7.9 and would have done a lot

better if it wouldn't have been for a 5’

had break at the end of his routine;
according to D’Amico. Jeff _
McBroom---also had ‘a:-= good A ﬂoor
exercise. and hit. adouble back in
his routine, scoring a 7.9.

Despite a lot of nervousness, the
ring team only‘ missed their
expected total score by one and one -
half points. McBroom had a solid
routine and scored 8.45, while
walk-on Dave Shandelman had a
7.55.

In the» vault, four Panthers
scored an 8.9 or better, to give the

~ vaultinglteam an average score of _

over 9.0. Kris Femiani had a 9.3,

' Bob Besong hada 9.1, McBroom a

PHILADELPHIA — “I never
thought I’d be an athletic direct-
or,” said Penn State’s Joe Paterno,
still sitting in his coach's office.

“I never had an interest in being
an athletic director,” insisted
Paterno yesterday.

“I’ve repeatedly told people no,
when they brought up the
subject,” said the coach whose
Penn State teams in the last 14
years have compiled an .816
winning percentage, best among
-major college coaches with at least

 10 years experience.

Then why did Paterno add the ,
' job of Penn State athletic director
to his already burdensome job of
coaching a perennial Top 20 team?
Paterno was named to the dual
1role Monday. Athletic Director Ed
Czekaj was’ kicked upstairs and
made an assistant for ﬁnance and
operations. Paterno begins wear-
ing two hats March 1. ‘
Paterno said he did not seek the
job, but that Penn State president

 John, Oswald asked him to do both

“I told hiin (Oswald) no,“ -.

Paterno said in a telephone
interview. «

ember conversation with the
university president. ’

Meanwhile, Paterno took his
team to the Liberty Bowl and beat
Tulane. When he got back, the
decision to make a change in the
athletic director’s office was a fait
accompli.

The only question was whether
the new athletic boss would come
from outside the university or from
within the department ranks.

Oswald took another run at
Paterno.

Paterno said the president sent

,/

down a list of reasons why he,

wanted the football coach to take
the additional responsibility..

Paterno said Oswald pointed out
that the coach had been at the
university 30 years, had seen the
athletic program grow, knew the
mistakes that had been made, and
could take positive action quickly.

Oswald, according fo Paterno,
felt that there was’? great advan-
tage in having someone from inside
take over, rather than bring in an
outsider who would have to learn
the university’s personnel and
philosophy.

Paterno also made it clear that he

‘had been assured that Czekaj was

being moved into a job where the

veteran administrator could stay on
top of the university's fiscal
program.
“The athletic directorship is
f more of a leadership position,”
Paterno said. “He sets standards.
You get the right staff and‘the
department almost runs itself.”,
, Paterno admitted that now that
he had made the move he was very

excited about the prospects of the ‘

job.

“Yet, if you talked to me two
weeks ago about this I’d have told
you you were nuts.

How much would the athletic
director’s job interfere with Pa-

terno’s time to coach a big time 1

college football team?

Paterno avoided getting into
percentages, merely said he would
allot his _, time to whatever was
necessary to get the particular job
done. 

“I have to commit to a/program
of 31 sports,” Paterno said. “I also
have to realize that football has a
great affect financially on the other
30.’ ,1 can organize in a way that I
‘can do it or I wouldn_’t have taken
the job A.D. 2‘

“IfI ﬁnd that I can’t do it justice
to both jobs, I’ll back away from the
athletic job and coach,” Paterno

said. T

Paterno said his assuming the
top spot in the athletic department
would not have any affection the
football schedule. He claimed that
nobody in the last five years had
been scheduled without his ap-
proval. . \

This despite a standing joke
about the five game \. series
scheduled with Temple that con-
cludes next ‘season. Paterno,

anxious to play major college

winners—Temple was not a big
winner in those days—inade the
remark, “What drunk scheduled
that series?” ,

“I knew someone would bring
that up,” he said when reminded of
the incident. .

,“The big advantage in being
athletic director as well as coach is
that I can sit down and make plans.
I don’t have to ask people before I
do something,” Paterno said.

He would not elaborate on the
subject‘. , F

Paterno said that he hoped his
new dual role finally would
convince people that he did not
want to coach pro football, and
intended to remain ‘at Penn State.

“I hope to coach 10 more years,” 1

Paterno said. ' ,

Paterno said his wife, Sue, was
excited too about the new post.

“She’s glad all of the uncertainty

that I might leave Penn State and —

get out of coaching is all over. I do '
have a little more control over what
Ido.”

It’s important what Sue thinks.
Paterno once turned down a $1
million offer to. coach the National
Football League’s New England
Patriots, because he felt his family
was happy at Penn" State and did%:\:&r-
want to leave. — I

Wouldn’t the new job inhibit his
football recruiting and his recently
announced intention to get closer to
his players? a

“No, being athletic director is a
good excuse for me to stay home, V
notto go anyplace,” Paterno said.
“Although I’ll always t‘ake.time to
recruit. The only thing really new
is making policy.’_’ _

Didlhe get a substantial raise in
salary with the dual job? a

‘ ‘We haven’t even talked about it
money,“ Paterno insisted. “But
I’m sure the university will take
care of it. I'm not negotiating. I’m
only concerned about getting the
job done.”
