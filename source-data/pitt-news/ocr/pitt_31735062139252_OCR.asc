To Recommend Plans

The committee appointed to study
out plans for the payment of .the
deﬁcits in the various ‘student activi-
ties is hard at work, and has about
coinpleted its investigation. A meet-
ing will be held to-day at 12:30 when
deﬁnite, recommendations will be
made. It is probablethat each mem-
ber ofithe class of 1913 will be as-
sessed $3.25 to pay the debt of the
1913 Owl, which amounts to $700, and
the Universitiylwill be asked 10 col-

‘ lect the $650 from the class of “19l2,

which is due on the l9l2 Owl.’ -

It is planned to meet the $290 PITT
WEEKLY deﬁcit by asking the Uni-
versity to advance ‘the money, and
later some plan will be made .to
raise money by the students, proba-

iblv by "a. tag day.

It has been decided; to make the

Mr. Seibel Addresses
College Assembly

“Thelmportance of Keeping Sanei’
was ably expounded in College chapel
Wednesday.morning, by Mr. George
Seibel, editor of-e “Volksblatt und
Freiheits-Freund.” Mr. Seibel, al-
thpugh not an alumnus of the Uni-
versity, justiﬁed his presence by re-
lating several “inside” stores about

 

the historical pageant given last year,
of which he was the author. After
telling some of the amusing adven-I
tures of the “property man,” Mr.
Seibel grew serious and based his
message on Matthew Arnold’s char-_
acterization of Sophocles: “He saw.

life steadily and saw it whole.”‘ He
said in part: :i . 1 I
’g“Political ﬂurries, gold standard,

tariff reform, ctc., rarely affect the
_individual. But there are three pop-
ular fads that are going a long way
toward destroying our sanity. »They
are: Vaudeville, moving pictures and
sensational newspapers. We must
cultivate and maintain our poise of
soul if we would keep, ourselves free
[from theturrnoil and disorder around
TJxis is the highest duty of edu-
cation. to inculcate a spirit of sanity
and broadmindedness in the coming
generation.” ’ I

As the educational year draws to a’
close,» attention is again drawn to the
increasing generosity of the Univer-
sity in"giving out scholarships among
the honor students of manyiiof the
secondary schools and private acad-
emies of.Western Pennsylvania. Year
after year. the activity along this line
has been increasing, more scholar-
ships being added to ‘the list annu-
ally. This year scholarships valued
approximately at $20,000 will be is-

CAP AND GowN CLUB
‘ PERFORMS AT ALTOONA

 

To a° select antltappreciative au-
ldience. the Cap and Gown Club pre-
sented the “Prince ‘of. Sham” at‘ the
Mischlier‘ Theater in ’ Altoona last
Monday. Two ‘performances were
given one  the afternoon and one

0 in the evening.

‘ ' Rain fell throughout the day, which
put a damper on the town and kept
many people in their homes.
.I-Iowever,'the size of the audience
did not in the least impair the en-
thusiasm that has met, the club in
every theater where it hasperformed.

Several box parties of ladies were en-I

tertained by some friends of the club.

V -The alumni were present in force.

V listeners

Not a quiet moment was noticed
during the whole show save the in-
terval between _the acts. '

Thus, alternating, the company and
formed a friendship that
held them in their seats applauding

after the last curtain hadvvdropped.

School songs and yells held sway for
many minutes. "
j By the assistance of “Doc” Moyer,
whose-.home is in'Altoona, the stu-
dents were placed in the best hotels
in town. The cast and chorus each
in" a separate hotel. . ’ '

‘Owing to‘ a cancellation of the en-

"gagement at Greensburg and Harris-

burg , the men returned Tuesday
morning. Negotiations -are under
way to have the show presented in
the‘ former of these towns next week.

 

I -ENGINEERING SENIORS .TAKE

T SERIES OF INSPECTION TRIPS

 

The senior engineers are taking ad-
vantage-of the ﬁne weather and are
busy visiting the different manufac-
turing establishments. On Monday,
-April 14, the .bunch journeyed to Mc-
Keesport, where they were shown
through the plant of the National
Tube Co. The trip was made in au-

. _.'tomobiles driven by Prof. R. T. ‘Stew-.

' art, C. Snyder and L. Taylor, and was

reported as being a regular joy ride.
Upon their arrival the fellows were
shown through the? plant by ‘the

A heads of departments, and these ex-

perts explained the process of, mak-
ing steel tubes. The engineers re-
ceived the most courteous treatment
and in being allowed admittance to
the works were accorded an exclusive

’ , honor. . v ' . M
On last Monday the class went to

Ellwood 'ty, via the Harmony
Route, whe it visited the plant of

the National Tube Co. 'This plant is
not a large one in comparison, but
the highest quality of seamless tub-
ing is made. The fellows were in-
structed in all the proceages by the
courteous ofﬁcials.

Next Monday the members expect
to go to. the ones and Laughlin
works at South ide and Aliquippa,

where a thorough study of the metal-.

lurgy of'ir0n and.steel will be made.
-These trips are very instructive, and
gives the student an, insight into the
practical work.

This is a b‘igadvantage and shows
that Pitt is the ideal location for an
engineering school, for, as Prof.
Stewart stated this morning, ‘in many
schools» an inspection trip would
mean the outlay of over $100.

STUDENTS TICKETS
To BE COMPULSORY

 

The following letter was sent by
the Board of Control to the Board of
Deans and Boardof Trustees of the
University: . A

“At the last meeting of the Student
Board of Control, it was decided that

adopted by the Advisory Committee,
be recommended to the approval of
the Trustees and Deans of the Uni-
versity. This Student Activities Book
isgto cost" ﬁve dollars, for which the
student ‘gets ,_the Pitt Weekly, the
Owl,’ two admission tickets to the
Cap and Gown, and two admission
tickets to” the .Glee Club at. their
home performance. This will save
each student about $2. Each organ-
ization gets a fair and sufficient part
of the ﬁvedollars, as outlined by the
Advisory Committee. The plan
failed absolutely this year, because it
was voluntary. ,Very few’ students
purchased the book. The only solu-
tion, as is done‘ in many institutions,
is to make the $5 Student Activities
Book compulsory. The support of
2,000 students with a little decrease
per student is worth many times the
support of 300 or 400 students, as at
present. These ﬁgures and state-
ments are a result of the investiga-
tion by the Student Advisory Com-
mittee. The unanimous support of
the entire student body is necessary
to make our student organizations
successful. Their success or failure
have as much to do with the success
and progress of this University as
appropriations. The plan proposed
will prevent the student organiza-
tions from falling into debt, as in the
past. Therefore, we urge that the $5
Student Activities Book be added to

Athletic Book. It is necessary.

STUDENTS, Discuss DEFICIT‘
IN FRIDAY ASSEMBLY

 

Bombs were dropped among indif-
fetzent -‘students last Friday in the
University Assembly, by,Chancellor,
S. B. McCormick. After the truants

from chapel had been vigorously

-ﬂayed, and the attendance question

thoroughly gone over, Dr. McCor-
mick brought before‘ the assembly a
question of vital importance to every-
one——that of the indebtedness of the
various clubs and publications ‘of’ the
University. The chairmanship-of the
meeting was then turned over to R.
H. Wettach, ’13, President of the
Board of Control. The various organ-
izations have deﬁcits as follows; 1912
Owl, $650; 1913 Owl, $700; The Pitt
VVeekly, $536; the 1909 Courant, $90,
and the Musical Clubs, $450.; The
meeting was then thrown open to the
student body and several leading

members spoke, on the question. J.

P. Harvey, ’1{1, Editor of the PITT
WEEKLY, defended the attitude‘ of
the. college paper, and asserted that
it should not be saddledwith debts
of former boards. R‘. K. Patton, ’l3,
expressed the feeling "of many, that
the time has come fora more prudent
responsibility, on the part of indi-
viduals and organizations in assum-

‘ing ﬁnancial obligations. H. R. Davis,
.’13, and VV. H. “Colbert, ’l4, spoke
sbrieﬁy and to the point.

Colbert
moved, seconded by VV. H. Allen, ’l5,
that a committee be appointed by the
chairman of the meeting to take
action on the question and report

back to the student assembly this.

THE .MELLON INSTITUTE
The new Mellon Institute, which
will ado.rn the campus within eight
months, will contain a laboratory
costing $100,000. There will be .a
large force of men of high degrees
continually on the job solving the
problems of high" cost of living. With
these will bea force of 70 fellows,who
will be assisted by students of the
University who are taking work in
chemistry and writing theses.

With the very best chemists in the
country under the efficient direction
of Dr. Robert K. Duncan the beneﬁt
to the University and the community
promises to be most creditable.

The opportunities afforded the stu-
dents who. desire to enter the ﬁeld of

. chemistry are greater here than at

any place in the country. Here we
will have within one year the ﬁnest
equipped laboratory in the world..-

 

eoon SCHOOL SPIRIT

The spirit shown -by the Pitt stu-
dents at times like that of last week,
when the amount of indebtedness of
the past student publications was
made known to them, is deserving of
great commendation.. I

; To have a n_io"tion pass the student
body guaranteeing the amount of a
printing bill totaling seyeral hundred
dollars without one dissenting voice
shows that we are coming to our own
in loyalty and school spirit. It is a
victory for the University because it
shows the character of thestudent
body.as a. unit and a victory for the
University publications in that it
proves the'students are with them
and backing them up. .

The next move is for the students

to willingly abide by the decision of ' i

the ﬁnance committee and immedi-
ately clear up the debt. Let every

, , ‘student do his share for‘ Old Uni.
Pittsburgh, Pa., under Act of March pg » . .

c"

Editor Pitt ‘Weekly: .

It has been reported_that the fac-
ulty after a stormy session has issued
a decree whereby absolutely no cuts
will be allowed. For every absence
a neat little excuse must be given. to
the instructor. What is Pitt coming
to? » Is it to be conducted like a com-
mon grade school? ‘A majority of
the students in Pitt are of sufﬁcient
age to look after their own interests
and do not need to be taken care of
by .the omnipotent faculty. None of
the modern universities "have any such
ruling, and there is no reason why
Pitt should have_ one. The faculty
should.at least grant the freedom of
four cuts. Is not this a matter for
the Student Senate?

An Undergraduate.

 

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir:—I desire to express
through your columns my hearty
commendation of the compulsory ‘at-
tendance at the weekly, student as-
sembly which was put into effect last
Friday. One of the causes for the
so-called “lack of spirit” at Pitt is the
fact that the student body is not to-
gether enough. By’ the compulsory
attendance rule, all the students will
get together at least once a'week, and
as a result school spirit at Pitt will
receive a great impetus.

The Mellon Institute has two main
functions, as set forth in the terms of

First, the prosecution of industrial

Second, the instruction of graduate

University, and pay the regular fees
to the University. The institute will
also‘ accept seniors and other prop-
equi ped undergraduates, for
thesis WOHE, delivering the credits for
such work to the department of the
University concerned. '

The excavating will be, started as
soon as the contractors can get on the
job. The old frame building has been
moved several hundred feet west on

Credit for the whole conception of
the institute must be given to Dr.
Robert Kennedy' Duncan, Sc. D.. its
present Director. ‘ It is entirely the
child of his brain. .--He has been with

' it continually and developed it faith-

fully, until now it is unique among
the educational institutions of Amer-
ica. There seems no reasonto doubt
that when .. mpleted and equipped
the Mellon itute will be the great-
est institute for industrial research in
existence. On the wall of Dr. Dun-
can's office is the pregnant motto:
“_Et quiscunque voluerit piimus
bestruni, sit vester servus.” — (“And

‘ whoever would be'ﬁrst among you,

let him be your servant.” _
The whole work of the institute is

done in this spirit andwith this r_nO-

tive. _ ~,

Muskingum was no match for-the
University of Pittsburgh ‘in a game
ﬁeld. — last
Tuesday afternoon, and the Blue and

"Gold ran -away with the game by the

score of 7-0., Harenski, who was on
the rubber for" the University, made _a
record for himself by letting down his.
opponents without a hit or a run.

_ Such a record is seldom made—espe-

cially‘ so early inthe season-—_a_nd if
Harenski keeps" up that pace until the

end of the season the members of the

big leagues will be ﬁghting each other
toﬁsee who can pay the most money
to get his services. ’

‘ The entire Pitt team played a splen-
did game and there_ was never a

-' chance for the Muskingum crowd to

get in the running at all. Pitt made

~ eleven hits, including a home run and

a two-bagger, and ﬁelded in perfect
style. , The Muskingum pitcher, Dilts,

pitched a fair game for the most part,
.but his support was ragged in spots

and this made the good work that he
accomplished of little importance.

. Dillon and McConahay were the
sluggers for Pitt, each man getting
three hits, but Mac’s hits_ amounted
to seven bases. Some time ago the

’*—~j\,writer said to watch’th_i_s» man McCon-

ahay when he got started, ,and now

that he has started we wish to say

once more to keep your eyes on him.

BASKET BALL “CAPTAIN T0
" BE~iiLEGTED NEXT WEEK

Arrangements for a dinner to the
basketball team, at which time the
captain for next year will be elected,
are now being made. The’ date has
not been deﬁnitely decided, but it
will be held'during‘the coming week
at.C0ach Dr. G. M. Flint’s residence.

_The, dinner‘ will be the payment of
a bet between Coach Flint and ‘Capt-
Campbell on the Pitt—Penn_ game.

Just -before the game last Decem-
ber 28, Capt.,Campbell, who was con-
ﬁdent of victory, and Coach Flint
who, though quite as conﬁdent, made
a bet in regard to the outcome of the
contest. Capt. Campbell agreed to
‘set up a.
lost and Cﬁach Flint agreed to pay
for, it if Pitt won.
team, after a ﬁne exhibition ofbasket
ball, defea'tedACoach Flint’s old team-
mates, and now “Doc” is going to
make good his promise. '

This is the 3rd,year.t'hat Pitt has
had a basketball team. The first
.year Lefty Vi/eger captained the
team through a fairly successful sea-
son. Last year the team showed up
much stronger underthe coaching of
Doc 'Fli_nt and leadership of W. F.
Campbell. ‘These two men‘ served in
the same capacity this year and de-
-veloped one of the strongest-ma-
chines that ever represented Pitt.’ A
hard schedule was played,» but Pitt
succeeded in winning 17‘ out of" the

 

24 games played.

VVith .4 of this year’s team, as mem-
bers and good available substitutes
prospectsare good for a winning
team next year. .

respective managers have decided to
play a series of baseball games (par-
