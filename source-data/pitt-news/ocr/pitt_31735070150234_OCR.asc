Roc the Panther might be calling
in reinforcements to rally Pitt ath-
letics.

And his options include a real 6

panther.

‘ . Alex Murdoch, the business

manager of Pitt’s Student —GQVl¢I"l‘l-V
ment Board, has been campaigning
to ﬁnd a live panther to become the
beloved mascot of the University.
Last semester, he thought of the
idea when he was a First Year Men-
tor.

“I thought it might be cool idea
to possibly pursue,” Board member
Murdoch said. “A full-grown pan-
ther would .be the best. I think it
would be awesome. A lot of students
have -shown support for the idea.”

It’s worked for other schools.

But ﬁnding a panther of Pitt’s

own could be tricky. Although a lion .

in 1968, no other felines have made
a residence here since.

ELECTION 2012

Presidential candidates use music
to inspire, mobilize voters

Shruti Revankar
"For The Pitt News

At a recent Obama campaign ral-
ly in Las Vegas,.cheers erupted
from an enthusiastic crowd, as
ralliersi raised their signs in sup-
port of President Barack Obama.
Amid the roar of the supporters,
pop icon Katy Perry, wearing a
dress that looked like a giant
ballot, warmed up the crowd
before Obama’s arrival by per—
forming her hit songs “Teenage
Dream” and “Firework.”

Music in campaigns is typi-
cal of election season, and as
Nov. 6 looms, Republican presi~
dential nominee Mitt Romney
and Obama are fervently trying
to capture the hearts of voters
through various methods.

Candidates commonly use
campaign ads and rallies in
strategic areas in order to woo
voters. Although these are two
different modes of communica-
tion, they share one major mu-
tual component: music.

Deane Root, a‘ professor of

music at Pitt, said candidates
sometimes get big—name stars
and figures from popular culture _
to join their campaigns and at— -
tract audiences to their rallies.
“It lends tothe candidate the
notion that they are operating at
a very top league that American
culture has to offer,” he said.

Obama
declares Pa.
in state of
emergency

Pat McAteer
Assistant News Editor

Pitt administrators say the Uni-
versity will likely remain open
Tuesday despite heavy rain ‘and
strong winds from Hurricane
Sandy, which made-landfallin
Newjersey late Monday night.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said as of 6:30 p.m. Monday that
there are “no changes” planned
for University operations on
Tuesday. But he added that stu-
dents will be notiﬁed through
Pitt’s Residence Life Office and
website if administrators’ tenta-
tive plans change.

Fedele also said that Pitt’s din-
ing halls and public safety office
will remain open regardless of
Hurricane Sandy’s effects on the
area because the employees in
these sectors are considered “es—
sential employees’? under Univer-

V sity guidelines.

Fedele’s announcement comes
after President Barack Obama
declared a state of emergency in
Pennsylvania and other North-
eastern states. Obama also grant-
ed federal aid to supplement state
and local emergency response
efforts.

The National Hurricane Cen-
ter said Monday evening that
Sandy is a post—tropical storm
and losing strength but still has
sustained winds at 85 mph.

to volunteer for the campaign leading up
to Election Day.

“Let’s give President Obama four more
years in the White House,” he said at the
free 45-minute concert, which featured
songs such as “Promised Land” and “No
Surrender.” Springsteen is no stranger to
using his inﬂuence to help Democrats -
he campaigned for Obama in 2008 and
forjohn Kerry in 2004. .

At a rally last Thursday, rocker Meat
Loaf endorsed Romney before deliver-
ing his own rendition of “America the
Beautiful.”

Music has the power to arouse emotion
in listeners as well, Root said.

“The role of recorded music is not nec-
essarily to just associate the candidate to
star power. It is also to get the audience to
feel good about the candidate,” Root said.
“Positive music makes the people there
feel happy, and they feel less discomfort
from standing up so long.”

Researchers at the Max Planck Society
in Germany have even established that
music seems to be a form of communica-
tion that does not discriminate between
cultures and languages.

This universality entices many politi-
cians to use music during rallies because
of the ever—changing demographic of the
United States.

Vincent Candilora, the executive vice
president of licensing for the American
Society of Composers, Artists and Pub-
lishers (ASCAP), said political communi-
cation teams base the genre of music used
in advertisements on targeted audiences.

“Romney and Obama use music to be
able to identify with the demographic
that they want to gain the vote of,” Can-
dilora said. , ~

Romney often blasts country music at
his rallies to try and give off an Ameri-
cana vibe.

Adriana Helbig, an assistant profes-
sor of music at Pitt, said music at po-
litical rallies is meant to connect ‘with
voters through the words of the artist,
and several factors such as artist political
leanings, gender and genre usually play
a role in a song choice by the campaigns.

Root agreed with Helbig, and added
that music provides a connection to
American values for listeners.

“The music itself carries messages that
connect the listener, whether consciously
or subconsciously, to values,” Root said.
“They are certain messages about what it
is to be a responsible individual in Ameri-
can society.” ,

Republican vice—presidential candi-

‘ date Paul Ryan spoke at the GOP conven-

tion about his diverging musical taste
from Romney. Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not
Gonna Take It” echoed from the speakers
at a few Ryan rallies. ,
“There are the songs on his iPod which
I’ve heard on the campaign bus — and
on many hotel elevators. He actually
urged me to play some of these songs at
campaign rallies. I said, ‘I hope‘it’s not a
deal—breaker Mitt, but my playlist starts
with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin.”’
Earlier this year, Obama’s campaign
staff released his campaign playlist —
both on the ofﬁcial Facebook page and
on Spotify —— which will play at his rallies
leading up to Election Day. The playlist
features songs such as “Home” by Di-

erks Bentley and “Everyday America” ’

by Sugarland.

Root said that when choosing effective
songs, candidates must pick music that
is positive about what individuals can do
to make a change.

“It is a delicate balancebetween seri-
ous and making the audience feel posi-
tive,” he said. ‘

The use of music isn’t a new method of
political communication, however. It’s an
age—old tactic that can be traced back as
early as the 19305, when Franklin Roos-
evelt used the song “Happy Days are Here
Again” from the ﬁlm “Chasing Rainbows.“

But because of newer legislation, many
candidates run into legal ramiﬁcations
regarding the music they use.

Candilora said that in order to avoid
this problem, candidates can obtain a
license from either the copyright owner
of the song or a blanket license from an
organization such as ASCAP.

Despite the apparent simplicity of
these steps, some candidates still have
trouble abiding by these rules. Helbig
said that these types of issues arise when
thereis question between when a song is
“just a song” and when the artist has the
rightto dictate how and when to use it.

The Romney campaign was heavily‘

criticized by rapper K’naan and the rock
band Silversun Pickups for not obtain-
ing permission to use their songs, even
though the Romney campaign insisted
that the use of those songs was covered
under a blanket license.

The problem was later resolved, with
the Romney campaign choosing to use
the Kid Rock song “Born Free,” instead.

Root said music in these rallies and
ads used to promote the candidates are
meant to empower the voters.

“Individuals making a change is what
politicians want to talk about, because
they want individuals to go to the polling
place feeling like they can make a differ-
ence,” Root said. I

Pitt Student Health’s referrals for

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

The stated purpose of the medical

_ clinics behind imissedmyperiod.
com is to “help you get all the
facts before you decide whether
an abortion is right for you.”
For the clinics behind mypreg-
nancycenter.org, their goal is to
“empower abortion-vulnerable
women to choose life.”

To me, those sound like two
different missions, and Women’s
Choice Network — the organiza-
tion represented by both web-
sites —— sounds like a misleading
name for an organization whose
ultimate goal is to convince wom-
en to carry their pregnancies to
term. But Amy Scheuring, the
clinics’ executive director, says
there’s nothing deceitful about
her clinics.

‘‘We’ve been open 26 years,”
she told me over the phone, “and
what we hear from women is ‘I

‘had to get an abortion because I
had no choice.’ We were hearing
that over and over again, so we
felt like somebody in our commu-
nity should be opening the door
for a different choice because if
[abortion] isthe only choice you
have, that’s a slim menu to choose
from. We intentionally use that
word [choice] because we really
want to make sure people under-
stand there is a choice for life,
and it’s much more doable than
a woman thinks.” ~

Women’s Choice Network exem-
pliﬁes a crisis pregnancy cen-
ter — a type of pro-life clinic.
Scheuring dislikes the term pro-
life because she feels it misrep-
resents their mission as political,
but I think it accurately describes
her organization’s belief that
abortion is a preventable tragedy.
They seek to intercept abortion-
minded women and convince
them that giving birth would be
the better choice. Supporters in-
sist that these clinics save lives
and provide compassionate care
to women who otherwise would
have been traumatized by their
abortions; opponents argue that
they often provide misleading
information about the effective-
ness of birth control, exaggerate
the physical.a‘nd mental risks of
abortion, and in some extreme
cases, entrust the care of their
clients to volunteers without
medical backgrounds.

In any case, it seems like ‘a
contradiction that Pitt — whose

‘Student Health staff is largely

pro-choice and aggressively pro-

. safer sex — has resource pack-

ets sitting in the Student Health

» waiting room that advertise the

Women’s Choice Network as a
chain of sexual health clinics
alongside the more obviously
named crisis pregnancy centers
run by the Bethany Christian Ser-
vices . I’ve asked doctors about
the inclusion during multiple ap-
pointments at Student Health,
but their answers weren’t satisfy-

lrepructive ‘services need standards

Pitt Director of News John Fedele
told me that “most literature on
display focuses on wellness, flu,
etc.,” and “we are not familiar
with the Women’s Choice Net-
work.” - v '

The doctors I’ve seen at Stu-
dent Health haveprided them-
selves on their referrals when
they couldn’t provide a service
themselves. And Student Health
does provide most of the sexual
health services you might ﬁnd
yourself in need of, including free
STD testing, birth control consul-
tations, emergency contracep-
tion and one free pregnancy test

l per semester. But that doesn’t

change the fact that with sexual

healthcare as politicized as it is

today, Pitt needs to establish and
follow a clear policy for deter-
mining where it will and will not
refer students. And advertising a
clinic through resource materials
distributed in your office is an
implicit referral.

I don’t mind if Pitt wants to
refer students to pro-life health
centers, as long as Pitt has es-
tablished a reasonable standard
—— competent medical staff, up-
to-date information, honesty and
respect toward clients and good
reviews from students who have
gone there for services — and
found that those clinics live up to
that standard. Iwould also prefer
if Pitt made a point to reveal the
goals and agendas of the clinics
it recommends. That way, stu-

Horror movie franchises take story lines, overdone plots too far

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Insistent demons and physical
and mental torture devices have a
well-established place in cinema.
Each fall, production companies
release a new set of ﬁlms that
seek to frighten audiences on a
whole new level.

But two franchises — “Saw”

and “Paranormal Activity” — 

have replicated their initial sell-
ing points with multiple movies,

working to cement the horror
into cinematic history. Whether
these ﬁlms act as a serious at-
tempt at horror or just a way to
make every teenager keep the
lights on at night, they have deﬁ-

nitely succeeded in scaring the .

sh*t'out of audiences. .

For years, fans of the franchise

Staff Report

Gory movies with terrifying story lines have
come back out of the cabinet and into the.DVD
player to help create an atmosphere reminis-
cent of the fearful season.

These movies are largely segmented by
hands turned into blindfolds and terrifying
journeys to relieve an overworked bladder
for those easily frightened by horror ﬁlms.

Many dread the Halloween ﬁlm scene.
Luckily there are alternatives: parodies of hor-
ror ﬁlms and science ﬁction, such as Richard
O’Brien’s “Rocky Horror Picture Show.”

“Rocky Horror Picture Show”

The ﬁlm follows the misadventures of a
prim couple, Brad andjanet. On an ominous,
stormy night, they become stranded with a
ﬂat tire and are forced to a nearby castle in
search of a telephone.

This castle, as the newly engaged couple

of people scantily clad and in celebration.
While the group’s leader — a transsexual
scientist, Frank — is hospitable enough to
allow the couple into his home, the others
somehow cannot ﬁnd it in their hearts to loan
the frightened couple a phone. Instead, they

soon discovers, houses an outlandish crowd,

are determined to guide Brad andjanet on a
journey ofself—discovery and sexual freedom
— a journeythat leads the audience on their
own path of discovery, both about'themselves
and about Frank and his followers. 

Not toworry, though. Each odd and some-
times horrifying twist is accompanied with an
upbeat performance — “I’m a sweet transves-
tite!” Frank proclaims in song — as a_reminder
that the ﬁlm shouldn’t be taken moreseriously
than the holiday. So, for those of youjust try-
ing to survive until the Christmas movies are
unveiled, try “Rocky Horror.” No one has ever
been too frightened by a musical.

“Night of the Living Dead’? --

Just like the zombies in this classic horror
ﬁlm, “Night of the Living Dead” refuses to die.
V Set in rural Pennsylvania, the ﬁlm follows
Ben and Barbra along with ﬁve others, who are
all trapped in a farmhouse, attempting to fend
off a horde of zombies. Pretty standard, right‘?

Back in 1968 when director George Romeé
ro’s soon—to—be-horror classic premiered in
Pittsburgh’s Fulton Theater, movies starring
our favorite brain-dead villains were not as
widespread as they are today, allowing “Night
of the Living Dead’? to claim the title of zombie
movie pioneer. The ﬁlm also set the tone for

blood, gore and all—around nastiness, earning

fans, along with a backlash from those who

Ultimately, the legion of fans “Night of the

zombies in the ﬁlm, as the independent ﬁlm

/ Pittsburgh is still at the forefront of the .

zombie movement 50 years later, playing host

to the Walk of the Dead, which set the world

record for largest zombie walk with 894 par-
ticipants on Oct. 29, .2006, at Monroeville
Mall. This record was broken shortly after
by the second annual’ Pittsburgh Walk of the
Dead, which had 1,028 participants in October
of 2007. Since then, new records have taken its
place, but Pittsburgh will always be the ﬁrst.

“Halloweentown” t '

When we think about epic cinematic strug-

. gles between good and evil ——]edi vs. Sith,

Gondorvs. Mordor, Will Smith vs. Aliens — we
are mistaken to leave. out the world—historic
struggle between Marnie and Kalabar —— the
town’s mayor 4 that unfolds in “Halloween-
town,” the 1998 Disney Channel ﬁlm.

From beginning to end, f‘Hal1oweentown”
embodies the qualities that made Disney
Channel originals, such as “Smart House”
and “Brink,” excellent forays into made-for-
TV ﬁlms. Following theexploits of 13—year- old
witch—in—training Marnie, this coming-of—age
story captures all of the horrid wit and vague
clichesthat make aterrible movie great. De-
spite itself, it is ajoyto watch.

Although Marnie’s grandmother seeks to
train her in magic, her mother reﬁises to al-
low her to learn the antiquated magical arts.
What follows is amagical journey typical of
the golden age of Disney Channel movies.

Although neither scary nor complex, this
Halloween movie is a classic becauseof its
light—hearted tone and age—friendly silliness.

“Edward Scissorhands”

 

Tim Burton has created many classics over
the years, but this ’90s ﬁlm holds a consistent

' fan base because of its compelling and not-

too—spooky plot.

“Edward Scissorhands” chronicles the
story an unlikely character who happens to
have scissors for hands. Edward Scissorhands
is a gentle man who .was gifted with an un-
usual physical attribute. He falls in love with
Kim while he attempts to acclimate himself
to society. And despite his desperate attempt
to blend into a world where each person has

" skin-covered ﬁngers rather than those made

of shears —— Edward even works ina beauty
parlor as the ideal hair cutter —- the ﬁlm dem-
onstrates that outcasts sometimes remain

_ separate from the rest of the world.

But this ﬁlm isn’t just a quaint attempt to
eliminate bullying. “Edward Scissorhands”
sheds light on frequent misconceptions people
make about others based solely on appear-
ances. Edward’s appearance, although some-
what frightening given his facial scars and wild
black hair, does not reﬂect his personality at
all. Edward is a gentle human with an unfor-
tunate disposition, and those around him are
unable to see past his physical disﬁgurement.

“Edward Scissorhands” isn’t a particularly
scary movie, but the eerie darkness that Bur-
ton evokeslin all of his ﬁlms deﬁnitely reso-
nates from the ghost—like characters and para-

normal features; The fact that Edward comes C
from a dusty old castle —.— not necessarily the —

most comforting of movie settings — along-'
side the other darker elements and themes
thatgplague the ﬁlm helps to create a spooky
atmosphere. Still, the movie has humorous
moments that keep the plot light and make
Edward one of cinema’s favorite misﬁts.

Though the ﬁlm ends on a melancholy
note, this -movie still leaves its viewers with
a sweet taste.

normal Activity” when viewers watched the
frighteningly amateur ﬁlming technique
that director Oren Peli introduced to make
the paranormal.situations seem less like
on-screen creations and more like real-life
happenings.

Because this franchise creates a realis-

tic sense of fear, viewers continue to seek .

this same paralyzing terror, allowing the
ﬁlms to continue into their fourth release
with “Paranormal Activity 4” this October.
And even though the ﬁlms aren’t convinc-
ing enough in their plot, they. present the
audience with seemingly average families
played by lesser-known actors. This false

sense of reality is what keeps audiences V

returning to view the ﬁlms. _ 2
Like the “Saw” movies, these movies
continue the initial story, slowing reveal-

ing more information about the characters ’

with each ﬁlm. They hold fans’ interest
through vague endings and unclear paral-

lels that force them to seek out the next‘

addition to the franchise’s set of movies.
‘If there’s' a broader context to either
set of ﬁlms, it’s deeply hidden. The “Saw”
movies could argue that bad behavior de-
serves punishment, but that doesn’t mean
it warrants a painful death, especially in
the hands of a once-suicidal man who just
wants to play a game.
“Paranormal Activity” has nothing that
logically grounds it to reality, and there
is virtually no underlying meaning to the

film’s plot. With each release, the films‘

continue to show the same terrifying de-
monic actions —— a paranormal version of
the “Saw” franchise. _

If there were more variation_ among
these ﬁlms, they might be able to capture
audiences on a more mentally invigorating
level. Repetitive cruel torture and demonic
inﬂuences don’t create. good television.
These movies inspire nothing but a sick
sense of interest in their viewers, the same
sick sense of interest that keeps the mov-
ies going. V

And even though_“Saw” ﬁnally came
to an end in 2010, “Paranormal Activity”
continues the suburban horrorstory with

its recent release, providing the public with ‘

cheap thrills that thrive in an audience full

With the score tied 13-13 inthe ﬁfth and ﬁnal set,
the Pitt volleyball team relied on its offense to se-
cure the 3-2 victory over DePaul. Kills by Monica
Wignot andjessica Wynn gave the Panthers the
ﬁnal two points that sealed the match win.

According to head coach Toby Rens, the win
was a result of the team’s outstanding playin
key situations.

“We played the pressure points very well,
especially in the close ﬁfth set,” Rens said. “We
established our offense, and I was pleased with
the overall team effort.”

Wignot agreed and added that mental focus
is important in close matches.

“We were able to keep our composure in the
match, and we focused on being aggressive,
which was important to come from behind to
get the win,” she said.

Sunday’s contest at DePaul was a chance for
the Panthers to defeat a Big East opponent and
redeem their 3-1 loss to Notre Dame on the road
Friday. '

Overdramatic stories ruining sports broadcast journalism

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz’ter

It has to stop.

It has to stop today, or I might walk away
from sports and never come back. I just can’t
take it anymore. ‘

You know what I’m talking about, sports .

fans: that constant drone of fake news. I’m
talking about the same story lines being re-
peated beyond redundancy on SportsCenter
each day: journalists digging where there is no
story, articles about nothing but speculation
and rumors and pots being stirred by whistle~
blowers who have nothing to blow about.

Wantto know what I’d watch if I wanted
to hear about A—Ro_d hitting on a fan during a
Yankees game‘? E! News.

But I’m done feeding the machine because I
can’t watch the only true version of reality TV
crumble around me. I cannot be here for the
demise of real sports.

No longer will I click on the article about
whether Tim Tebow or Mark Sanchez will start
at quarterback for the New Yorkjets.

Never again will I follow a link to a story
about whether Lance Armstrong’s third cous-

in, twice removed, saw him take an unusually
long time in the bathroom 12 years ago on
Thanksgiving.

1 just can’t force myself to be interested in
whether Rory Mcllroy or Tiger Woods is the
better golfer when both of them have at least
10 years left on the greens.

So, in an effort to stop it before it starts,
here are my ﬁnal words on stories you’ve heard
and stories that might be coming:

Sanchez vs. Tebow: Guess what? Neither
of them should be starting in the NFL. ,

Thejets should trade Sanchez for a premier
left tackle, give Tebow up for draft picks, ﬁre
head coach Rex Ryan and start over. Sanchez
had his chance,Tebow is ﬁnally where he be-
longs —— on special teams or with a headset
on — and Ryan is nothing more than a large —
both literally and ﬁguratively — distraction.

Lance Armstrong: Wow. Armstrong
doped? Really? '

I’m so surprised when 14 of the last 17 Tour
de France winners have been-accused or con-
victed of illegal drug use.

Ironically, those 13 other winners get a lot
less space on the home page of ESPN.com than
Armstrong. Cycling needs to stop trying to use

Armstrong as a scapegoat and admit that the
entire sport is full 0 “cheaters.”

Do I think a man who started one of the
most productive charity campaigns ever is a
bad person for allegedly doing what all of his
peers did‘? No. Would I have quit ﬁghting too
after spending $5 million to drag my name and
my family through the mud as I fought for my
innocence to be revealed? Yes.

Tiger Woods vs. Rory Mcllroy: ‘Can we
just talk about this in 15 years and let the men
play?

Robert Griffin III vs. Andrew Luck: See
“Tiger Woods vs. Rory McIlroy.”

When Peyton Manning returns to the play-
offs and the Indianapolis Colts don’t: Yeah,
they should have kept Manning.

The man could be the greatest quarterback
of all time. His neck? Yeah, I think his 109
passer rating this season — good for No. 1
in the NFL — says it all. Maybe if Manning
lost an arm or a hand, the Colts should have
considered letting him go.

When the Eagles ﬁred Andy Reid, let
go of Mike Vick and only got worse: Well
Philadelphia, you askedfor it; You’ve been
calling for Reid’s head,gi'ti<;e."_the Eagles didn’t

.’§‘=“*

get it done in the Super Bowl back in 2003.
This is what you get when you sign an
injury-prone, run-ﬁrst quarterback to a ri-
diculously massive contract and try to make->:
him successful in the NFC East and then try
to ﬁx that problem by ﬁring the defensive co-

‘ ordinator on a team whose defense is much

more reliable than its offense.

When Andrew Bynum and Dwight Howard
can’t save Philadelphia and'Los Angeles: memo W
to Philadelphia — you need more than one '
superstar to win in the NBA.

Next time you want to make a blockbuster
deal, do what the Lakers did: Smash four su-
perstars onto one team and see what happens.

It worked in Miami, right? Well, sorry Los
Angeles, but Steve Nash, Pau Gasol, Kobe Bry-‘*1’.

' ant and Dwight Howard are not LeBron_Iames,

Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.

In fact, that all-star core for the Lakers is
headed the wrong direction in age and de-
fensive ability. I’d be shocked if they manage

to get past an Oklahoma City Thunder team --1,

with the second-best player in the league and
the fastest transition offense around. I can’t

VOLLEYBALL

The Fighting Irish (16-6, 9-1 Big
East) defeated Pitt in four sets with
set scores of 25-23, 20-25, 25-11 and
25-14 Friday night.

In the opening set,-the Panthers
managed to gain a10—9 advantage af-
teraﬁve-point run. The scorewas tied
12 times after that point, but three
kills by Notre Dame at the 22-22 mark
secured the ﬁrst set win.

Despite the early setback, Pitt
sophomore outside hitter Mechael
Guess believedithat her team played 2
good volleyball in the ﬁrst set.

“I thought we really came together-
in the ﬁrst set as a team and that we

. carried that momentum over to the

second set,” Guess said. 3

The Panthers jumped out to an
early 7-5 lead in the second set and
were able to extend the lead to its larg-
est margin at 23-17. Pitt closed the set
victory on one of middle blocker]as-
mine Dittrich’s three blocks of the set.‘

Despite leveling the match score
at onelset apiece, the Panthers were

‘ unable to keep the momentum in the

 set. Notre Dame" developed a
16-9 lead and allowed only two more
points as the Fighting Irish took the
third‘ set. For Rens, the third set loss
was the result of inexperience and a

lack of focus.

“We did not come out with the
necessary intensity to play an expe-
rienced team like Notre Dame in the
third set,” Rens said. “To its credit,
Notre Dame did a good job of taking
its play to another level.” ‘ .

The ﬁnal set of the match was as
one—sided as the third, as the Fight-
ing Irish led for the entire frame. The
Panthers came within three points
at 15-12, but Notre Dame closed the
match with a 10-2 scoring run." '

0ffensively,~Pitt had no players
reach double-digit kills, Wynn and

. Wignotﬁnishingthe matchwith nine

kills each.

Senior libero ‘Margy Acton led
the Panthers with 10 digs, while set-
terjennajacobson added eight digs
and led the team with 19 assists in
the match.

The Panthers rebounded from the
Notre Dame loss to earn atightly con-
tested match victory over DePaul (8-

18-25, 2s—7,.,17—25 and 15-13.. _

Wignot led all players with 15 kills,
and she talliedacareer-highllblocks
in the match. Two other Panthers
reached double-digit kills, Guess

Zitzke recorded 38 assists.

In the ﬁrst set, the Panthers pieced
togetheraio-0 scoringrunto obtain
the 12-11 lead that they extended to
18-11. Pitt closed the openingsetwith
a solo block by Wignot.

“Blocking is something that we
have been working on for the past
month,” Wignot said. “It came to-
gether _today, and I was happy with
our team blocking execution.”

After DePaul battled back to take
the second set, Pitt dominated the
third set. The team’s success came es-
pecially from the servingline,where
it recorded seven service aces.

But once again, the Blue Demons
tied the match after claiming the
fourth set.

The ﬁnal set of the match was a
battle, as the Panthers found them-
selves at a 10-6 disadvantage. But

Pitt mounted a comeback built on _

the offensive kills of Guess, Wignot
and Wynn before sealinga 15-13 ﬁnal
set L

“We did a very good job on both
offense and defense,” Rens said af-
ter th‘e match. “Monica controlled
the net and played aggressively all
around, while Mechael’s offense re-
ally opened up a lot of options.”

The Panthers will return to ac-
tion at the Fitzgerald Field House
on Saturday, Nov. 3, as they take on
conference opponent University of
South Florida at 2 p.m. 1
