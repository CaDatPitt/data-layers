Brett Taylor
Assistant News Editor

When Deborah Furka interviewed at
Kent State University for her very ﬁrst police
job in 1983, the chief asked her where she
would like to be in ﬁve years — she told him
his chair looked pretty conrfortable.

Since then she has done just that

She’s been the police chief at Kean
University in New Jersey, and now she’s the
chief at Pitt.

When Furka was 35 years old, she set a
personal and professional goal to be chief
within the next ﬁve years —— two and a half
years later she started her job at Kean.

She has risen to the top in a ma1e—dom-
inated ﬁeld, at an earlier age than most men
do, and she has done so as a single mother.

On a table in Fu1ka’s office are two pic-
tures of her 11-year-old son: one a school
pictme and the other a Little League picture.
In front of the photos sits a small plaque
which reads “Deborah M. Furka, Director of
Public Safety, Chief of Police.”

Although her job keeps her very busy,
Furka said, she sets aside time that’s just
“Ben and Mom”

“You have to make time for important
things, like baseball games and band con-
certs,” she said.

Ben has a good head on his shoulders;
he’s very philosophical and ﬁiendly, though
at times, she said, he acts like an 11-year-old.

He likes Pitt, according to Furka, and is
impressed with Semester at Sea. But, Furka
added, he is really interested in police and

Why do so many students start smoking in college?

His contrasting
goatee and braces, one
symbolizing youth in
the ‘90s, the other
parental care, fought
the image the other
projected.

After the last hard
pull of his cigarette, it
was clear what image
had prevailed.

“I can quit smok-
ing whenever I want,
but not in the near
future,” said Henry
Umansky, a 21-year-
old freshman who said
he smoked to relax.

Now more than
ever, teens and young
adults are beginning to
smoke. Even though the risks are great
and the consequences highly publicized,
3,000 young people begin to smoke
every day.

The curious question is why?

Why practice a habit that’s taken on
the decades of negative criticism in
which it carries?

“I don’t think smokers enjoy 90 per-
cent of the cigarettes they smoke,” said

The Adbusters campaign is meant to show the evils of smoking cigarettes,

recent Pitt graduate Andrea Draper. “The
10 percent that I enjoy are the after work
or after meal cigarettes.” According to
Draper, she can rationalize her pack-a-
day habit simply from the enjoyment of
the 10 percent, even though she said,
“The others are just armoying ﬁllers.”
Draper, like many who begin to
smoke, took up the habit in college. “I
went to a party when I came to Pitt for

with their popular
and effective Joe
Camel campaign.
The once-
secret RJR papers
revealed that a
“comic strip type

might get a much
higher readership
among younger
people.” RJR’s
Camel brand, as a
result of their
aggressive market-
ing, now ranks sec-
ond behind

said.

Now more than ever, the negative
effects of cigarette smoking are being
argued and gloriﬁed. The immoral mar-
keting tactics of the RJ. Reynolds tobac-

retirement, the mar. keting minds of RJR
went back to the drawing board. A new
ad campaign is built around the resur-
gence of the tie dye culture, popular with
teens.

SMOKING

RJR camel logo as an integral part of dif-
ferent tie dye motifs. Draper, who is cur-
rently applying to master’s programs in
graphic design, was quick to find the tar-
get of the ads.

“They are tie dye, trippy ads.
That’s the culture that a lot of kids are
into. I can see why college students
would be attracted to those ads.”

Adbusters, a ﬁrm responsible for
ads that mock RJR’s Joe Camel, wants its
ads to have the opposite effect on young

A people. One ad depicted a bedridden,

emaciated andpale “Joe Chemo,” with-
out his trademark sunglasses, without his

A FROM PAGE 1

trademark smile. The Joe Chemo carn- -

paign, like RJR’s Joe Camel ads, was tar-

-geted at the developing minds of

America’s youth.

Advertisements aside, smokers agree
that the nicotine addiction, more than the
ads, is responsible for maintaining the
habit.

“I’d like to quit, but right now I still
like the taste and don’t know if I could
quit,” said 19-year-old student Dan
Iarnmarino. ’

The nicotine in cigarettes is the
addictive power of the habit. Nicotine is
an addictive drug, similar in that respect

to cocaine and heroin. Draper recalled a
neuroscience class, speciﬁcally Drugs
and Behavior, in which she remembered
the passage, “Nicotine is more addictive
than heroine.” ‘

“'I‘l1at’s a pretty scary thought,” she
said.

The American Cancer Society found
when taken in small amounts, nicotine,
which is actually a poison, produces plea-
surable feelings that make the smoker
want to smoke more.

According to smoke-free advocate
Patrick Reynolds, whose grandfather R.J.
Reynolds began manufacturing cigarettes
at the turn of the century, most smokers
are addicted both mentally and physical-
ly. The physical portion of the addiction

Tuesday, 17 March 1998

is to the nicotine. The psychological part
is the relaxing, familiar sensation of han-
dling the cigarette.

“The addiction is hard to define. It’s
very subtle and very powerful at the same
time. I think about quitting everyday,”
said Draper. She admitted, though, it’s
very difﬁcult. “I tell myself I’ll quit
tomorrow or I’ll cut back.
Psychologically, it’s really har .”

To quit, she claimed to need a total
stress-free environment — one without
commitments and work, applications and
deadlines.

“A vacation would be a good place to
quit. No phones, no stress, just relaxation
 and the patch,” said Draper with a
chuckle. I

FURKA

the  h

“He still has a long time before we have
to worry about that” she said

But if he’s anything like her, she might

mom PAGE 1

need to wony about it. Furka said when she

was 9 years old and in fourth grade, she real-
ized she wanted to be a police officer

“It kind of drove my parents crazy,” she
said “But I set my sights on it.”

As she grew up in Stubenville, Ohio,
policing was a part of Furka’s family. She
had an uncle who was the Butler police
chief, another uncle who was a U.S. marshall
and a cousin on the Pittsburgh police force.

Furka went on to college at Kent State,
andas anundergraduate shebecarnearesi—

idencehallsecun'tyaid.Aftergraduatingin

1979 with a degree in law enforcement and
administration, she remained at the universi-

I ty to work on her master’s degree. A year

later she was promoted to security manager
where she oversaw the operations of all the
security guards.

Then, in 1981 she received her master’s
in educational administration, but continued
to work in the residence halls until January of
1983 when she was hired by the Kent police
department.

She was promoted in 1986 to corporal,
where she was second in charge of the mid-
night shift. 9

In February of 1989, Furka was pro-
moted to accreditation and training coordi-

- nator. This was her ﬁrst administrative posi-

tron.
Accreditation is a self—assessment phase
for law enforcement where the department

rates itself according to a certain set of crite— .

ria, according to Furka.

In 1991, she was promoted to assistant
to the chief, and in June of 1995, at the age
of 38, she was hired as chief of police at
Kean.

Furka said she thinks the combination
of her education and experience helped her
to gain a chief job at such an early age.

She is one of 50 woman police chiefs
out of 15,000 departments nationwide.

Furka said she has had people react neg-
atively to her being in a traditionally male-
dominated profession. But she said she
thinks other people are more taken back by it
than she is.

“Resentment has been there,” she said
“But I haven’t paid much attention to it.”

She said she just tries to work hard,
establish goals and work hard to achieve
them

She carries a tattered old business card
that has a quotation from the late North
Carolina State University basketball Coach
Jim Valvano that says: “Success is simply
ordinary people doing extraordinary things.”

“That is one ofthe things I try to base
my philosophy on,” she said.

When she ﬁrst started getting involved
in the administrative aspect of policing,
Furka said, Kent’s chief came to her and told
her there are a lot of police people who have
egos.
Hetoldhertorememberweallputour
pantsonthesameway,shesaid,andtotreat

every person the way you want to be treated;
although you may not like the individual,
respect the position he or she holds.

“It was tremendous advice,” she said
“And it hasn’t done me wrong yet.”

She’s been fortunate, she added, noting
that a lot of women have not been as lucky
as she. ..

Cyrus D. Hardy, ‘ Furka’s interim
replacement at Kean, said he never saw any
problems in the department that were caused
by Furka’s gender.

He said the biggest obstacle people
found when she got there was the oﬂicers’
getting used to the changes she made.

“She made oﬂicers take responsibility
they didn’t take before,” he said

Hardy said Furka didr1’t change what
the oﬂicers did, she just organized them and
deﬁned their areas of responsibility. He
joked that police oﬂicers are the biggest

complainers around because they have a lot
of free time when they are waiting around
for calls to come in.

But, he said, the officers got used to the
changesFurkamadeandaddedthatallthe
new procedures are still being implemented
even though she’s gone.

Since she got to Pitt on Feb. 1, she’s
been getting to know the department and not
making any real administrative decisions,
but said she will start to m next few weeks.

Her main goal for the department is her
vision to make it one of the premier law
enforcement agencies in the country.

Pitt has the potential to be one of these
departments, she said

“Any changes I make in die depar1rner1t
would be in light of being a professional in
both word and actions,” she said

Furka was an asset, very versed and knowl-
edgeable.

“She’s very personable and a real lady,”
Ronan said “And I mean a lady in quotes.”

Furka implemented a lot of good pro-
grams, according to Ronan, and she helped
the department to grow.

“She’s the kind of person who says,

‘Here’s what we need to do. How do you

think we should do it?”’ Hardy said

She sets goals and then sits back and lets
the people under her contribute to canying
them out, according to Hardy.

‘That’s a good leadership trait,” he said
“She would let other people carry out her
goals, but there was no doubt who was
boss.”

All the while, he said, Furka treats
everyone fairly.

“If you guys get tired of her,” Hardy
said, ‘you can send her back here.”

INDIANAPOLIS '— Ever hear that old line,
“My handwriting’s so bad, I should have been
a doctor?”

Doctors have long been notorious for
poor penmanship. But it’s no laughing matter
if their orders can’t be read or are misunder-
stood.

But now, Indiana University’s School of
Medicine is about to do something about that.
Beginning in the fall, the school will add a
section on penmanship.

As assistant dean notes, “Doctors have to
write fast and a lot,” which leads to sloppy
handwriting.

Those who have to regularly read the
scrawling of physicians welcome the elfort to
improve it.

NEW YORK — Opening statements have
been heard, in the New York trial of a man
accused of torturing a woman he’d met on the
Internet.

Oliver Jovanovic, a graduate student at

Columbia University, is charged with kidnap-
ping, sodomy, sex abuse and assault against
the woman.

A prosecutor says the woman thought it
was safe to go home with Jovanovic because
she thought he was gay.

The prosecutor says instead, Jovanovic
tied the woman up, dripped hot candle wax on
her and beat and sexually abused her for more
than 20 hours.

The defense contends the woman is lying.
Jovanovic’s attorney cited e-mail messages
from the woman to J ovanovic after the alleged
incident, in which she described a sado—
masochistic experience.

The defense calls the woman unstable,
and says she blames Jovanovic in order to
absolve herself from something she likes but
considers dirty.

Small changes for
a safer campus  

Deborah Furka is now ‘in her second
month serving as the new chief of the Pitt
police force. Now that she's had a chance to
settle in, it seems like the right time to make
some suggestions about how to improve cam-
pus safety. These might not make it to the top-
priority list, but they are problems that could

, be easily fixed, and should be.

To start with, the photos on our Pitt iden-
tification cards should be bigger. Much big-
ger.

Right now, the pictures are about 60 per-
cent the size of a photo on a Pennsylvania dri-
ver's license, and only about 40 percent the
size they could be.

Bigger photographs on the ID cards
would provide added security in a number of
ways, not the least of which is preventing
someone from breaking into a residence hall
by stealing somebody else's card, as few of
the guards seem to scrutinize the cards very

‘ carefully.

Larger photographs would add a measure
of convenience, too, allowing those guards
who do check ID cards to do so quickly, with-
out having to squint and stare to make out the
tiny, low-quality images that seem to fade
quickly into obscurity. Nobody will mind the
added security of having their cards checked
if it adds only a second or two to their entry;

' on the other hand, if it adds 10 seconds, that

can become tiresome, quickly.

Other security devices that ought to be
revamped are the emergency phones on the
elevators.

The buttons are often placed either too
high for a 4—foot-9 person to reach, or so low
that they are continually bumped by accident
when an elevator gets even slightly crowded.

The fact that they do get bumped so often
seems to have caused another safety problem:
It often takes far too long for a response.
Members of this newspaper's staff have
already listened to the dialing noise the emer-
gency phones make for more than a minute
before an accidental call was acknowledged,
if at all. »

Make sure the response time is reason-

able. And as far as false alarms are a concern,
we offer two small words: button covers.

One small step for man to protect mankind

Kris Kissel
Oplnlons Editor

If ever there was a good reason to
develop a strong space program 

Last week, the whole planet shud-
dered with the news that a very large
asteroid might be on a collision course
with Earth. Though later, more exact
calculations revealed the mile-wide
rock's path will not actually be a ren-
dezvous with death for us, let's hope the
scare of Armageddon will be enough to
convince politicians to spend more
money» on developing our national
space program -

You see, had‘ the asteroid actually
been on a collision course with Earth,
we had enough warning to do some-

’ thing about it. With 30 years‘ warning,

we could launch a mission to ren-
dezvous with the rock and mount rock-
et engines — tail pipe up —— to the aster-
oid's surface. Those rockets could then
gently nudge the asteroid off course,
guaranteeing that it wouldpass a safe
distance away from our blue bulls-eye.

Butinorderforaplanlikethatto
work, we need to have a space program
that could get us to the asteroid None of
our current vehicles is capable of such a
manned mission, but the technology we
would need is either available or 
our reach, according to many experts:
All we need is a commitment to devel-
oping a space program with that capa-
bility.

And we shouldn't wait too long to
start. Astronomers have identiﬁed and
are eontinually tracking 108 potentially
hazardous asteroids that periodically
sweep across Earth's orbit around the
sun. But they say there are probably
more than a thousand potentially haz-
ardous rocks out there we haven't seen
but that could wreak havoc on our
world ‘~

What kind of havoc? A mile-wide
asteroid like the one in’ last week's news
would probably kill a signiﬁcant por-

tion of humanity, wiping out coastal
cities with several-hundred-feet tall
tidal waves if it hit the ocean or causing
ﬁres, earthquakes and climate changes
if it hit land.

A“ _two-rnile-wide rock would
cause the equivalent of a nuclear—win-
ter, possibly killing the entire human
population.

And though two miles wide may
sound pretty big, in the vast reaches of
our solar system that is measured in bil-
lions of miles, they're much more elu-
sive than needles in haystacks.

But ever since we watched on tele-
vision as a large asteroid crashed into
Jupiter a few years back, much of the
public and the media has been captivat-
ed with the idea of an asteroid hitting
Earth. In fact, the forthcoming movies
Amwageddon and Deep Impact will be
centered around asteroid disasters. ‘

According to The Philadelphia
Inquirer, NASA spends about $1 mil-
lion a year on tracking real asteroids.
Meanwhile, Hollywood spends about
100 times that making movies about
them. '

“With so much public interest in the
subject, you'd think politicians would
be willing to spend more on the scien-
tiﬁc programs. But they have to
appease people like my sixth-grade sci-
ence teacher who once said she didn't
think we should be spending money on
a space program when we have prob-
lems like the homeless right here on
Earth to contend with.

I wonder if she'd be saying the
same thing had last week's news con-

’ ﬁmred an impending doomsday from

above.

But that's the shortsighted mentali-
ty that most people seem to have: If it's
not an immediate danger, don't worry
about it

It's also an incredibly ignorant
mentality.

Consider the fact that the asteroid
which might have killed us in 30 years

THE PITT NEWS

will actually be passing close to Earth
once before that, in ZOCB, at a distance
of just six million miles. A manned
spacecraft travelling at the same speed
we used to put men on the moon would
take just six months round trip to save
the planet by deﬂecting the rock's path.
That could have been the opportune
time to launchvsuch a mission.

But four years is an awfully short
time for us to develop a strong space
program, and it's possible that we

wouldn't even see an asteroid coming’

with much more notice than that.
There's no excuse for us not to be

taking this threat seriously right now. I

Developing such a program wouldn't
be all that fantastic; in fact, the private
sector is already getting into the space
race. Another Philadelphia Inquirer
story from early February described
wealthy entrepreneur James Benson
who wants to start a business mining

‘asteroids for valuable resources that are

rare here on Earth —— deposits of iron,
gold, platinum and other minerals
potentially worth trillions of dollars. He
claims he can get into the business for
just about $50 million, to start prospect-
ing with robot probes. E

Most of the hardware is available.
We still need to develop some technol-
ogy for sustaining manned missions.
Even if such a life-saving mission isn't
necessary anytime soon, that same
technology will enable scientiﬁc
endeavors like a manned station on the
moon, or even a manned mission to
Mars. '

And of course, we need to spend

-more money ﬁmding astronomy to

detect such threats. The earlier we get
started, the safer we'll be.

Computing lab consultants aren't paid to play Doom

Kevin

Carey

I was having diﬂiculty with a disk, or
actually the computer was having a difficult
time reading the ﬁles on my disk The rou-
tine of normal questions ran through my
head What is wrong with this disk? Why
won't this disk work?

I got up from my seat and began the

. journey for some assistance. I approached

the ﬁrst lab assistant. He looked at me as
though one of us were in a daze, unfortu-
nately he was not sure whom. I gave him
the "I need your attention" stare. He missed
the look, and he began to question my sex-
ual orientation.

Me: Excuse me, it seems as though there is
something wrong with my disk. I was won-
dering if you could take a look at it for me?
Computer Guy #1:

Me: What am I a mirage or something?!

A witness of this exchange: Do you mind
if I borrow that line sometime?

Me: No.

Me: (Directed at Computer Guy #1):

Thanks for the help! I couldn't have man-

aged it with out you! ,
I was determined to ﬁnd somebody in_

the lab who would help me. I made my way

toward the second half of the lab. The lab
consultants were sitting around at their
computers doing work of some type.

At this point, my thinking was, that I
had found the hive of workers, and I was
bound to get some help.

Computer Guy #2 was seated and

» working diligently as I neared his desk He

was frantically rolling the mouse around in
what seemed to be a circular motion.
Suddenly he stopped, and with great preci-
sion and might, he snapped his right index
ﬁnger down on the head of the mouse, near-
ly breaking its neck!

It then dawned on me. He was exercis-
ing his mouse! What other explanation
could there be? Instantly Richard Sirnmons'
voice entered my head. "Come on you little
mouse, work it, get some sweat going!" I
composed myself, held back laughter and
took a closer look '

He was playing with his software!

Honestly, the guy was shooting bil-
liards. I wanted to say something, but I ﬁg-
ured I would just let him have some fun. We
all need a little "break" from the hardships
of work sometimes. Whatever the case was,
one faulty disk drive, a laugh or two, and
two lab consultants later, I still had not
received any help.

My patience was dwindling. I looked
across from "Minnesota Fats," previously
identiﬁed as Computer Guy #2, and saw
Computer Guy #3.

Apparently, Computer Guy # 3, as well
as "Minnesota Fats," was chalking his stick
over some exciting software. The two guys
were playing each other in pool via the great
achievements of software and networks. L

The struggle continued I was running
out of lab assistants to make fun of, and I
still had not received any help. Then, just
when I thought the chance of getting any
help was equal to that of hitting the
Keystone Jackpot, I peeped my head into
the printing room and located another
worker. Computer Guy #4! Finally, some-
one that was going to help me with my
faulty disk.

Well, suffice it to say, that my head was
not the only one doing some peeping. It
turned out that Computer Guy #4, now
deserved the alias of "Hugh Hefner," based
on his reviewing skills. Hugh was playing
sorrre pool too, it was just a game of anoth-
er variety.

Neednl say more!?

I never did ﬁgure out what was wrong
with my disk that enjoyable evening at the
computer lab. I did however ﬁgure a few

things out.

Whoever hires these workers must be 4

of the same competence level as the work-
ers themselves. It seems that every time I try
and seek help at the computer lab, I get
heckled Is there an asocial characteristic
requirement that is essential to being
employed as computer lab help?

An interesting component in this situa-
tion is that these employees can understand
Java, Pascal and Cobalt languages, but yet
they fail to understand the least important
language of them all: English! Who needs
English anyway? It is merely the most sig-
niﬁcant tool for communication in this
country. .

Perhaps the second most unique ele-
ment in this scenario is that it is usually the
male employees who provide the hassle.
Thus, I referred to the workers as Computer
Guys. Who ever would have thought that
operating a computer would bring out the
man in you? '

I have just one request for anybody
reading this: If you're employed as a techni-
cal assistant, then be exactly that.

Kevin Carey believes that the library secu-
rity gtiard should swap his walkie talkie for
duct tape.

Harvard. 11

Calling Harvard a reputable bas-
ketball school would be like calling
Penn State the worldwide leader in
all forms of undergraduate educa-
tion. No one in their right mind
would pick Harvard to make the
second round of the NIT, much less
pull off an upset in the men’s cham-
pionship tourney.

Well, they’d be right. Sort of.

While the Harvard men relax at
home, reading Lampoon magazine
and studying until their slide rules
hurt, the Harvard women are still
playing basketball.

Seeded 16th in their bracket, the
Crimson faced off against top-
ranked Stanford University at
Stanford Saturday night.

And on the strength of a 35-
point performance by Allison
Feaster, Harvard bested the home-
town heroines, 71-67.

Arkansas is next on the Crimson
schedule, in a game that finished
too late Monday for consideration
in today’s issue. Although, if the
oddsmakers and selection officials
deserve their jobs, Harvard’s
women should be back on the plane
to Massachusetts by the time you
read this.

But so what?

March Madness, men or women,
is about upsets. And, in a shocker
never before witnessed, the worst
team in a bracket downed the brack-
et’s best.

Unfortunately, said downing
took place very late Saturday night
—— buried deep in the sports pages
that focused on Rhode Island’s stun-
ning upset over Kansas in the men’s
tournament.

For those interested, URI was
seeded eighth. Kansas beat its first-
round opponent, 16th-ranked Prairie
View, by almost 60 points.

Last Saturday night was the
Pitt gymnastics team’s best perfor-
mance of the year in its final home
meet at Fitzgerald Field House.
The gymnasts were nearly perfect
in all four events in the 193150 to
191.025 win over Towson State.

“Team spirit was amazing,”
said 1 Pamela Lieberman. “We
almost went 6-for-6 [referring to
the fact that all six women in every
event were nearly unstoppable] in
everything.”

“This was probably the most
satisfying performance I’ve had in
my career,” said Pitt Head Coach
Debbie Yohman.

Yohman was also pleased with
the student spirit. There was a nice
student turnout that helped to sup-
port the team.

Pitt was up against a talented
and ranked Towson squad. But
evening, the team
showed the strength and determi-
nation they have possessed all sea-
son long.

Lisa Fronhofer led the team on‘

the vault with a 9.6, after she sat
out the last couple of weeks with a
stress fracture. .
Next, the women scored their
highest point total of the meet on

the uneven bar rotation with a
score of 48.575. The Panthers
swept the top three spots with
Samantha Salyers (9.850),
Danielle Alba (9.800) and Janet
Highhill (9.775), placing respec-
tively.

For Kirk Bruce, destiny

came in the form of the
American Basketball
Association.

The 1970s pro league

known for multi-colored basket-
balls and Afros sought out the
former Pitt star shooting guard
and current women’s basketball
head coach, and Bruce reported
for duty to the Utah Stars after
the 1974-75 Panther hoops sea-

Then, the league folded. Faced
with either continuing profes-
sional basketball life via free-
agent camps and tryouts or
returning home to Pittsburgh,
Bruce chose the latter.

“[If the league hadn’t fold-
ed] I probably wouldn’t be
where I am, I wouldn’t have got
married when I did, and I
wouldn’t have the family that I
have,” Bruce said.

Bruce returned home. He’s
stayed here ever since, coaching
area high schools and Panther
basketball teams — men’s and
women’s for over two
decades and bringing a sense of
family to the women’s basket-
ball program.

He came back to the area of
asketball that he’d been a
major player in for almost a

 decade, from his days as

swingman for South Hills
High to his four years at shoot-
ing guard with the Panthers
from 1971-1975. His introduc-
tion to this scenecame from an
expert on the subject —— his
father, Clarence Bruce, who had

a stint with the Negro League

 “He’d go to any game he
could find,” the son said
about his father. “He took
me to see all the games he
could find. If I
was at practice, he’d go
and come back and tell
, me all about it.”

attracted Bruce from
the start. When asked
about it, the coach
paused, then said sim-
ply, “To know that I
would play on the
same court that Billy
Knight played on  I
watched him [play] so
many times.”
Knight, one of
seven Pitt Panthers
ever selected to the
All-American team,
starred for Pitt while
Bruce was in high
school, and played
with Bruce on the
1973-74 team that

won 22 straight games — a
school record.
(Knight’s was the ﬁrst name

of many that Bruce mentioned
when asked about the Field
House tradition, but the coach
was quick to add, “I feel the
same way as Coach [Ralph]
Willard does in terms of what
[the convocation center] will do
for us. The tradition will be long
forgotten when you build a new
building — it’ll build one of its
own.”)

Bruce played in Knight’s
shadow early on, but soon creat-
ed one of his own, leading Pitt in
scoring his senior year with 17.4
points per game.

After his senior year, it was
off to Utah. 7

“I played in rookie and
exhibition games in the sum-
mer,” said the Lady Panther
coach. “We played until
December.”

In December, the ABA was
no more. Bruce went on waivers
after the early days of the sea-
son, and unlike others in the
league who went to Europe or
NBA camps, he, took his game
(and his memories of playing
against Moses Malone) back to
college.

“I could have bounced
around, but I didn’t decide to do
that,” Bruce said. And although
there was no concrete job offer
for the coach upon his return,
“Coach [Tim] Grgurich told me,
‘If you don’t make it, you can
come back here.”’

So Bruce became an assis-
tant with the Panther men the
year after he graduated, helping
Coach Grgurich and the team to
a 12-15 record. That same year,

he took charge of the Clairton
High School men’s basketball
team — a team he would lead to
three playoff appearances in ﬁve
years. He would also teach there
part-time, making use of the
education degree he’d earned at
Pitt.

The Clairton men went to
the playoffs in three of Bruce’s
seven years with the program.
Bruce coached a number of
standout athletes, including
Darrell Gissendarmer, who
would move on from Clairton to
Pitt, letter for the Panthers in
basketball and baseball, then
sign a football contract with the
Pittsburgh Steelers.

When a position opened
under Pitt women’s Coach Judy
Saurer, Bruce applied for it and
got it. And when asked what the

toughest part of the
men’s-women’s jump
was, he naturally
responded that the level
of play was tough to get
used to.
The women simply
played at a higher level
than his high school
team, the coach said.
Even before his year
with Saurer, Bruce had
been exposed to
women’s hoops for
some time -—— he and his
family frequently made
their cross-city sports
trips to see the games of
Kirk’s sister, Jennifer
Bruce.

Jennifer Bruce (now
J emiifer Bruce Scott, married to
a former Duquesne basketball
player) led the Pitt women in
scoring for three straight sea-
sons, including the year that
Bruce started as an assistant.

“That really was a nice
experience for me,” said the
coach. When Saurer left for a
job closer to her hometown of
Erie, Bruce took over, and after
eight years as the Lady
Panthers’ head coach, he
brought in another branch of his
family tree.

Or perhaps an oﬁshoot.

Assistant Coach Anderson

Bruce said.) and has since been instruct-
ing the guards in practice and hitting on
the recruiting trail. with Bruce. _
Anderson was coaching high school
ball in the area -- helping with the foot-
ball and basketball programs at Schenley
High — when he received a phone call.

“He [Bruce] just happened to run .

into a friend of ours ...,” Anderson said,
and two days later, the prospective assis-
tant was meeting with Bruce and then-
Assistant Athletics Director Carol
Sprague.

“I thought that there was a pretty
good connection between us,” he added,
remembering games at Southpl-Iills with
his current boss (Anderson was a senior;
Bruce was a sophomore). “His father
used to come to [Point Park _Col1ege’s]
games all the time. We wouldiplay dou-
bleheaders all the time with Pitt.”

The pair, now friends for nearly three
decades, let their off-court relationship
show at Lady Panther practices and
workouts. Anderson thinks the friendly
atmosphere lightens the pressure on the
team; Bruce can’t remember the last time
he and Anderson went through an entire
day without bringing up some of the
area’s greats — men and women —— that
the two were forttmate enough to play
with or watch.

“Sometimes hollerin’ and screaming
at them doesn’t do any good,” Anderson
said.

The Pittassistant describes Bruce as
“relatively cool,” both pacing the side-
lines during the games and during prac-
tice. The practices the duo put together
show off this coolness and relaxed atti-
tude — a bout or two of team-wide
laughter breaks out on occasion, and
Assistant Coach Carol Morton (Pitt point
guard, class of ‘95) has been known to
join in the team’s scrimmages.

This light mood has been criticized
as a reason for the team’s sub-.500 record

over the past three seasons, including a 6- ,

21 performance in the 1997-98 cam-
paign. The team members don’t see it
that way.

“'I‘hey’re both great guys,” said Pitt
guard Michelle Katkowski. ‘They treat
us like people instead of objects that play
for them. In high school, that’s easy to
ﬁnd  but not in college.”

Those in search of an explanation of
the recent downturn can look in the train-
ing room. Katkowski spent much of her
time there this season, gingerly recover-
ing from off-season knee surgery early in
the year and battling the effects of the ﬂu
in the middle of the schedule.
Katkowski’s backup, guard Tamica
Hunter, injured her back halfway through
the season and missed the rest of the year.
Fellow starting guards Gina Montesano
and LaTonya Blanton also battled knee
injuries. .

our classes,” Katkowski ' said. “And
we’ve done pretty well in our classes this
year.” _,

As for the recruiting trail, Bruce and
Anderson can not start talking to
prospective Pitt players until after the
NCAA women’s tournament concludes.
The Lady Panthers have two spots to ﬁll
next year —— after the early signing of
New Jersey power forward Brooke
Hyman — and are still actively searching
for a post player and a point guard to
complement the team’s returning players.

VV1th the lineup as is, disregarding
any of the players he might have spotted
this weekend at a high school tournament
in Columbus, Ohio, Anderson said that

the Panthers are a 20-win ballclub. Bruce
was less willing to offer a prediction
(‘”l‘hat’s nice to hear,” he said, when told
of Anderson's remark.), but he quickly
added that a healthy Panther team was
capable of such a performance.

And, according to Katkowski, said
healthy team would love to turn in such a
performance for a coach that deserves it.

“He really does care about us,” she
said. .“And he would sacriﬁce anything
just to see us do well.”

Bruce, though, doesn’t think he’s
sacriﬁcing anything to stay in his home-
town. He’s never looked for another job
in his decade—plus stint as head coach,
and doesn’t appear to be bound for Utah
or anywhere else any time soon.

“You never want to say never, but for
me ...” he said, “I personally feel this is
the place for me.” A

Softball team still
searching for home

Alicea Crosby

Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh softball
team is homeless this year
— its first season ever at the
University.

The team currently has
no field to call its own, and
this year, in its only home
game, the squad takes on St.
Francis in the football stadi-
um.

Carol Sprague, senior
associate athletics director
for women’s administration,
said that negotiations are
being made concerning
where the team will play
next year. There is no defi-
nite field yet, but there has
been some talk among Pitt
officials about the _ team

As far as using that field
is concerned, “Nothing is

score, I was watching the next per-
son up,” said Alba.

The final event of the evening
was the floor exercise. Heather
Hanson of Towson won this event
by a fraction of a point (0.075) over
Pitt’s Calli Bodnar and Colleen
Crisi.

Yohman was happy with
Bodnar’s performance because she
has been hampered by a foot injury
for the last couple of weeks.

“We performed almost as good
as we could,” said Yohman.
“Maybe we could have picked up a
fraction of a point here of there.”
The key word was maybe, Yohman
felt it may be almost impossible to
do better than Saturday evening’s
performance.

After the meet was over, the
senior members of the team were
honored before final awards were
given. Seniors Bodnar, Kristin
Bond, Tracey ' Brown and Joy
McElhinny were individually
called out to center mat where they
were met by Yohman. The thankful
coach gave each senior gymnast a
hug and a bouquet of ﬂowers while
her career biography was
announced over the sound system.

The team’s outstanding perfor-
mance could not have come at a
better time. Now, it is preparing for
the East Atlantic Gymnastics
League Tournament next week at
Rutgers and then two weeks later is
the NCAA regional competition
hosted by the Panthers at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Harvard’s upset win makes
Rhode Island’s victory seem
downright. commonplace. The
Crimson celebration marked the
first time in 75 games that a top
seed fell in the first round of a
64-team tournament. Harvard’s
win also broke Stanford’s 59-
game home win streak.

So the Harvard women won
in front of a hostile crowd,
against a national power, and
because the game was late in the
evening and it didn’t happen to
occur on CBS, nobody gave a
darn.

Seems like a good time for
the women—athletes.-are—people—
too lecture, but I’ll spare you.
Besides, after covering Pitt
women’s hoops for two out of the
last three seasons, I’m kind of
biased.

Instead, think about how’
much of March Madness goes
unnoticed by even the most vora- V
cious basketball fan. Late-night
games on the West Coast never
see the front pages of the sports
section, and are relegated to the
depths of the CBS television
schedule. Entire women’s brack-
ets go ignored. High school
championships -— remember, the
other amateur tournaments that
go on this month? — occur all
around us.

THE PITT NEWS

Fans sit in shock when No.1
seeds fall prey to No. 6, No. 3, or
even No. 2. After Kansas fell in
the second round, an audible
shout could be heard across the
land, as those with the Jayhawks
in the finals of their office pools
debated throwing their new ESPN
Magazines out the window.

UNC—Charlotte nearly caused
a similar mass reaction. Instead,

fans watched, nails gnawed down .

to the knuckle, as their office
respect (as far as sports knowl-
edge goes) prepared to crash
down faster than you can say,
“Told’ya Duke ruled.”

Then, a sigh of relief. The
world could continue spinning
about its axis, safe in the knowl-
edge that the best team won and
the office pool still had a shot at
respectability.

That’s the excitement. That’s
the emotion.

And, for anyone paying atten-
tion late Saturday night -—- home
early from a party, finished a late
night on the job, flipping through
channels because professional
wrestling got pre—empted, or
whatever —-— there was a great
dose of it available.

Kevin Lilley is a columnist for
The Pitt News and probably
would have taken‘ Kansas over
Rhode Island in the office pool.
Good thing he doesn’t play the
office pool. '

TRACK

Those victories come at the end of a
season in which Smith competed in few
jumping events. Smith had a long, gru-
eling 1997 season. Lewis decided that
to maintain peak performance, Smith
needed a break, a decision that now

FROM PAGE 9

1 looks pretty smart.

Earl, just a sophomore, had been
ranked as high as fourth in the nation in
the 800 meters during the season. She
improved on that when it counted most,
finishing third in the event at the cham-
pionship meet, earning All-America
honors. Her time of 2:06.09 also set a
new school record for the 800 meters, a
fact Earl credits as much to what she
called an “extremely fast” track at the
RCA Dome as to her effort.

For those of you who think the
NCAA has problems seeding teams in
the men’s basketball tournament, take

Tuesday, 17 March 1998

note. Earl was seeded 17th in her race,
the last person to qualify. That’s not
what was on anyone’s mind once the
race started.

“I had told her that if you go to this
meet, the ultimate goal is to win,”
Lewis said. “She carried out that plan as
best as she could. With everything she

did in that race, she was clearly trying .

to win.”

“That was on my mind the whole
time,” Earl said. “I was kind of nervous
at first, but when they shot the gun, I
said I’m going out to be a winner.”

Earl spent most of the race around
fifth place. With about 300 meters to go,

she started gradually moving up, even-

tually reaching third place.

Hazel Clark, from the University of
Florida, won the 800-meter race in
2:02.53. Georgetown’s Julian Reynolds
was second in 2:04.75. The three top
finishers in the race are all underclass-
men.’

If the University has to use

a number of renovations.

are no bleachers.

Other softball teams in the Big
East have fields that seat 250 or more
people. Rutgers University has a 250-
seat softball field on the same com-
plex as the school’s baseball field. The
University of Connecticut’s softball
team —-— in existence since 1975 —
calls a 1,000-seat field home.

No one knows where the Pitt soft-
ball team will play next year, but we
know that on March 25, 1998, the
team will play at home, in the football
stadium, where seating arrangements
will not be a problem.
