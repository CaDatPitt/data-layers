Residents In Towers
Want Open Visitation

The men of Towers A and B,
in a recent poll, asked to keep
the Men’s Dormitory (MDC) Dry

Cleaning Service where it is and .

have the game room facility in
the basement of Tower B im-
proved; and to allow women in
residents’ room between the hours
of 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. every Fri-
day and Saturday night.

According to Tom Meisner,
MDC president, the petition also
queried dormitory men as to
whether they favored the trimes-
ter system, as opposed to a se-
mester or quarter system.

As reported in The Pitt News,
the petition was answered by 728
men, representing 53 per cent of
the approximately 1,370 residents.
Favoring the trimester were 92
per cent or 668 men,,si.x per cent
or 43 men were for the semester,
and two- per cent or 17 men ad-
vocated the quarter system.

Meisner stated that 81 per cent
of the men who answered the
poll favored the improvement of
the game room, while 19 per
cent favored having the dry clean-
in: service moved to the game
room site. According to Meisner,
“Auxiliary Enterprises has prom-
ised to have _the game room im-

proved by the fall term.”

0 .. 5. ‘ question... of

"that MDC passed a resolution

women’s visitation, the men voted
91 percent’ in favor, and nine
per cent opposed. Meisner said

similar to the one favored in the
poll, “but as a result of discus-
sions-with the administration, the
following proposal was given
back to us. Junior and senior‘
men would live on elevator floors
in the Towers and they would
have the privilege of women’s
visitation at the stated times.”

Meisner stated that this admin-
istration proposal was’ brought
up at the last MDC meeting and
tabled for further study. A

urvey Committee  
Questions Students

Undergraduate students
may fill out questionnaires
regarding state - relatedness
and the trimester next Mon-
day, Tuesday, and Wednes-
day 1O a.m. to 3 p.m. in the

Towers and the Commons Room.

The questionnaire, sponsored by
Student Government (SG) is the
work of the Study Survey and
Analysis Committee, chaired by
Michael Ruxin. An allocation
from the administration will cov-
er the entire cost of the question-
naire.

Ruxin’s committee is a sub-
committee of the SG Poll and
Forum Committee under SG Sen-
ator Gabriele Edwards. The com-
mittee worked closely with Dr.
David Landy, chairman of the
Anthropology Department, and
Dr. Ralph Buchsbaum, professor
of biology. Both are members of
the University Senate Education-
al Policies Committee.

Mrs. Hilda Jones of the vice-
chancellor’s office for planning
and general,_ affairs also helped
the group. The entire question-
naire was scientiﬁcally oriented
under the auspices of Dr. Jiri
Nehnevajsa, chairman of these-
ciology department.

The aim of the questionnaire
is to achieve a stratiﬁed sample
of the University community.
Graduate students will be polled
_through their respective ‘depart-
ments.

The questionnaire, containing
approximately 40 questions, will
take only ﬁve to ten minutes to
ﬁll out. Completely anonymous,
it will include socio-economic
questions of a general nature,
questions on attitudes toward the
trimester, semester, quarter sys-
tems, and state-relatedness. ,,

Undergraduates will use a\vot-
ing type procedure in ﬁlling out

"will be in position to combine

the questionnaire. They must pre-
sent an invoice to be stamped
before they receive it.

The University Computer Cen-
ter will tabulate ‘the results,
which will be coordinated with _
the results from a similar poll of
the faculty. They will be pre-
sented to the Educational Policies -
Committee which will give them
in turn to the University Seiiate
and the Chancellor for considera-
tion in drawing up the ﬁnal plans
for the University calendar.

By BERN! McLEOD

A After two years of teach-
n‘g Eng-lishgand history at
he University of Equador.
,-Dr. Murdo MacLeod, assist-

r7ant professor of history,’ is
la relative “insider” on Equadori-
'5}; life. ~
” In discussing Equador’s unique
,national problems and character-
istics, Dr. MacLeod ﬁrst noted
that the biggest social headache,
‘like in the United States,'centers
around the issue of integration.
‘FEquador has a caste-like divi-
gsionl between the Indians of the
"nterior," said Dr. MacLeod, “and
"the city dwellers, who are large-
Jly of Spanish descent. These In-
:_dians live outside of the economy.
"Unlike city people, who are quite
patriotic, they may not even
know that they live in Equador.”
As ‘in many South American
“countries, the middle-class in ur-
{ban Equador is growing Very
Islo'wly, helped along by new in-
-come’ tax laws and social legis-
lation. Also on the rise is interest
in education and politics. “Politi-
-cal ‘interest, in fact,” noted Dr.
"MacLeod, “is even higher than
in‘the United States.”
In a country where so many
-. people are indifferent toward the
United States, the student group
_.is an exception, Generally anti-
American, they charge the U. S.

with being too materialistic.
“Since students put more em-
phasis on the non-developmental
aspects of life,” said Dr. Mac-
Leod, “they value the humanities
such as poetry and drama. As in
America, Equador ‘has an over-

abundance of lawyers, and most
of éiem can’t ﬁnd work,” he add-
ed. A

Despite such values, more and
more students are going into tech-
nical ﬁelds, and ignoring the hu-
manities. The poorest students, in
fact, are usually'found in the
ﬁeld of education.

In’ the South American tradi-
tion, most of the city people of
Equador are Roman Catholics.
“The Church,” noted Dr. Mac-
Leod, “isn’t very strong, how-
ever, because it has supported
the elites and done very little for
the lower classes.” Speciﬁc rules
of the Church, such as mandi-

tory attendance at Sunday mass, '

are often overlooked, especially
by men. \ I

Culturally, Equador still needs
azgood deal of development. Dr.
MacLeod stated that the library
systems were poor and that the
government, through the Minis-
try of Education and Sports, does
little to improve the general sit-
uation. Despite conditions, soccer,
the national sport, and the na-
tional theatre are very popular
and thriving activities.

enough that the student body is

Wrestling. "
Needs ‘
Help

by TOM SACKS Assistant Sports Editor

  

A shot of heroin in the arm or a sniff of ‘pot’ and the
dope fiend drifts off into a world of dreams and spiraling
fascination. For the wrestling fanatic Pittsburgh will be
his Mecca this weekend with the action up at the field house
being his ‘pot.’ ‘ I

An exciting, evenly contested match starts the adrena-
lin pumping in even the most callous of onlookers. There’s
something about two twisting bodies that brings out the
‘animal instinct in even the most sophisticated.

But wrestling is not all action and groans. In the nine
minutes that is spent on the mat, the majority of time is
passed in maneuvering for position, which in many matches
boils down to a “you shoot first” attitude. When this hap-
pens Friday or Saturday night, the fan who just came up to
see what the sport is all about will soon regret ‘his curiosity.

Collegiate wrestling has been cautiously grooming a
fan appeal for many years now. At several schools, such as
Lehigh, wrestling has established an appeal similar to. that
which football has at Notre Dame. Even the lovers’ lanes
are empty on the night of a home meet in Bethlehem. And
no one can argue the fact that wrestling has come a long
way if it has even succeeded in replacing sex as a source of
stimulation on Saturday nights.

At other universities the appeal has not been so dra-
matic. Rex Peery struggled for sixteen years to generate
a hard core of wrestling fanatics in Pittsburgh; The at-
tendance at. the home meets this year indicates that he
wasn’t wildly successful in his attempt. Many felt that lack
of support was one of the reasons prompting Peery to re-
sign last year.

If cornered Peery might sadly agree. “You can’t use
Lehigh as an example. There’s tradition at that school. I
recognized a mans’ face last year when we went to Lehigh
that I remembered from the days I was wrestling and that
was quite a long time ago. For Lehigh the Easterns are
like a family reunion.” V _

But as Peery indicated, Lehigh is an exception. For the
average person a family reunion is about as appealing as the
war in Viet Nam. Wrestlng needs a shot in the arm. If
facts are needed, look at the attitude of many of the East-
ern athletic directors.

Syracuse won the team title at the Easterns last year,
yet orange coach Ed Carlin‘ recently claimed that his A.D.
was down on the sport. “How can we hope to grow when I
only have one scholarship to work with.”

Panther coach Dave Johnson doesn’t exactly have the
Mellons backing him. When he starts his recruiting tour
later this month, he’ll have three and a half scholarships
in his pocket. If wrestling was a fan drawing sport, the
money for improvements mightmaterialize. Since a mat
struggle has the action potential to attract fans, what is
wrong? .

One of thefaults is that the action seldom materializes
in a nine minute match. “When kids realize they have to
shoot for nine minutes, they try to pace themselves,” says
Johnson. A possible solution ‘for the coaches might be a.
change in the rules from three three minute periods to three
two minute rounds as now exists in high school.

Down in the locker room after the Lehigh match sev-
eral weeks ago a man was saying, “Those kids were stalling
so much I felt like getting up and walking out I was so
bored.” The speaker was Engineer coach Gerry Leeman.
Leeman is in favor of a time change as are Johnson and
Cornell’s Jim Miller. Their argument is that the wrestlers

Lehigh, Middies Top Contenders

For Eastern Team Supremacy  

By TOM SACKS »

Jungle warfare and Fitzgerald Field House hardly ever
go hand in hand, but all that will change Friday and Satur-
day. The ﬁeld house will be the site of the nation’s oldest
intercollegiate athletic event, the Eastern wrestling cham-

pionships this weekend.

The team title will most likely be up for grabs between

Boni Misses

Title Defense

A champion likes to de-
fend his title. A champion
hates to retire. The plague
that has forced many cham-
pions to retire, has also hit
Dino Boni. Boni was the 140-
pound E a s t e r n Intercollegiate
Wrestling Champion last year;
this year he’s injured.

Against West Virginia three
weeks ago, Boni ruptured a blood
vessel and suffered other com-
plicated injuries which add up to
something similar to a hernia. It
was a rough blow to Boni and a
tough break to the wrestling
team which needed Boni in the
line-up to give them any depth at
all.

“I feel doubly bad about not
wrestling now,” said Boni. “All
my relatives came into see me
wrestle and the home crowd has
only seen me once this year.
That’s what really makes me
feel bad.” '

“I’m going to the doctors this
week to see if there is any im-

provement, and possibly I may

be able to get a chance to wres-
tle in the Nationals. I'm still not
sure if anybody’ is -going to go.
There might not be enough mon-‘
ey to send anyone.”

Boni is the second Pitt Eastern
Champion to be sidelined with
an injury in his senior year-. The
same thing happened to Mike
Johnson last season.

TICKETS

There are roughly 200 re-
served seats left for the wres-
tling’ tournament this weekend.
Reserved tickets for the whole
series cost $6.50. General ad-
mission tickets are also avail-

, able with the cost ranging from

$1 for all sessions except the.
ﬁnals to $2_ for thegﬁnals Satur-
day night. The ﬁnals’ session is
expected to be a sellout. Tick-
ets can be obtained «at Fitzger-
ald Field HouSe’s ticket office.

Lehigh and Navy. The Middies,
who are ranked fourth in the na-
tion by an amature polling group,
edged Lehigh, 19-14, in their dual
meet back in February.

Considering the rapidity of a
tournament and the individual
emphasis, the fact that Navy did
win their meet with the Engi-
neers doesn’t make it the auto-
matic pre-tourney favorite. What
most experts are predicting is
just the opposite.

The Engineers are anchored at
the short end by their three
“mighty mites” — Mike Caruso

(123), Joe Peritore (130) and Bill
Stuart (137). Stuart is a senior,
while Caruso and Peritore are
both juniors. In the years that
the three have been wrestling for.
Lehigh, they have compiled a
combined record of 72 wins, three
loses, and three ties.

Stuart and Caruso are the de-
fending champions in both the
Easterns and the NCAA. Peritore
was the runner-up in both tour-
naments last year. Besides these
three, Lehigh is also assured of
p o in t ‘- p r o ducing performances
from Elliott Teppers (145) and
Jon Rushatz (167). Tepper has
dropped two matches this year
while Rushatz has gone unde-

.feated.

Navy’s chances were given a
setback .earlier this week when
it was reported that its 145-
pounder, Bob Sanders, has in-
jured his arm. Sanders’ record
thus far this year is 7-0-1. That
includes a win over Tepper.

Among ‘Navy’s other contend-
ers are Ga-ry Burger (123), Wayne
Hicks’ (137), John Kent (160).
Dave Palmer (167). Guido Car-
loni (191) and John Nichols (un-
limited). Hicks was the runner-
up to Stuart in last year's East-
erns. In their dual meet show-
down this year they drew, 2»2, at
Navy.

- Carloni has been recognized as
possibly the third best 191-pound-
er in the country, behind Bill
Harlow of Oklahoma State and
Iowa State’s Don Buzzard. Nich-
ols, the Middie heavyweight, has
posted 3 9-1 record this year. Six

.. of his nine wins have been pins.

For the Panthers this year‘s

" Forty of the Orangemen’s 65
point winning total was accumu-
lated as Nance and Everling won
the heavyweight and 191-pound
titles, respectively, and Schlen-
dorf, placed second in the 177-
T-pound ‘division. *
W.-Nance, the 235-pound behe-
gmoth fullback now playing for
the Boston Patriots, whizzed
through his opponents pinning
ryone. ‘His quickest pin was
0.49: against Panther Al Traun-
steiner followed by a pin of Rut-
ger’s Paul Goble (4:46) and the
(‘championship decision over John
Illengwarth of Lehigh (3:37);

. Both Everling and Nance had
joined. the team late in the sea-
son, accointing for the Orange's
‘losing record during the '65 dual-
meet season. Everling, also a
football letterrnan, won his title
with a 4-2 decision over Army's
Tom Abraham. Everling scored
points on falls‘ and advance-
ments "in winning the title as
compared to Nance’s 16.
Supplementing the work of the
stocky gridders was the effort of
then-fsophomore Tom Schlendorf.
Schlendorf entered the tourna-
, cut as one of the East's top
sophomores, and used his bull-
adike build to defeat the Panther’s
second-seeded Lee Hall. Gerry
Franzen, the tournament's out-
standing wrestler, thwarted the
jblond-haired bruiscr in the fi-
i3als,‘pinning him at 4:45.

Ijehigh had trailed the Orange-
men‘ as a close second the entire
tournament, losing the title by
only six points. Although the En-
gineers could have won by Illeng-
.warth’s pinning Nance, the cru-
cial blow came earlier when
vS.y_1‘aCuse’s slippery Lew Roberts
urprisingly defeated ‘Lehigh’s
second-seeded captain, Harley
erguson, inthe 167-pound semi-
‘ﬁnals.

After dancing around for a 1-1
tie-.in' the regulation three per-
iods, Roberts entered an overtime
period. Ferguson chased Roberts
for, the overtime, but failed to
catch him as the overtime ended
1-1. The result was a controver-‘
 unanimous referees‘ decision
lacing Roberts in’ the ‘ﬁnals
where Penn State’s Marty Strayer

Five Titleholders Face Challengers
In Eastern Tourney This Weekend

By TOM SACKS

Wrestling is a static sport, or at least that’s
what everybody says. The line-ups are known
weeks in advance, What to expect from the up-
coming opponent is general knowledge, unless he
is a sophomore. But even then, a matman’s repu-
tation from high school has powerful wings.

Coaches will repeat that the Eastern Wrestling
Association is just one big happy family... “Wres-
tling is a sport where it is pretty hard to be sur-
prised,” said Panther coach Dave Johnson earlier
in the season.

Despite all that is said, wrestling reputations A

will be in for a face-lifting during the tournament
this wekendu A

The new faces will’be those of the champions.
There are ten divisions in the EIWA. Of those ten
individual champions declared last year, five have
graduated.'Fron‘i' aglance at Eastern competition
this year, only one of the ﬁve returning title hold-
ers appears to be assured of retaining his-crown.
He is Lehigh junior Mike Caruso -(123).

The other defending champions are Army’s Bob
Steenlage (130), Engineer Bill Stuart (137), Pitt’s
‘ Dino Boni (145) and Cornell’s Jeﬁ Stephens (160).
Bon might as well be stricken from the list imme-
diately. A hernia has already ended his college
career. . _ - A ' ,

Caruso and Stuart are the_ defending NCAA
champions also. The 123-pounder has four matmen
blocking his way this weekend. They are Gary
Burger (Navy), ' Wally Clark (Penn State), Bob
Stock (Cornell), and Saul‘ Shimansky (Franklin
and Marshall). The four combined have a won-loss

“Of all the top names returning, Caruso looks
like he'll have the easiest time of it,” says Johnson.
“I like a wrestler that is cocky,” continues
Johnson, who was a former three‘ time Eastern
champion. “When he's , out on the mat he un-

c nerves his oponent that little bit that counts.”

Two close rivalries have developed in the East
during the past few years. One is between Steen—
lage and Lehigh’s Joe Peritore. The other also in-
volves a Lehigh “mighty mite”—-—Stuart and Navy’s
Wayne Hicks.

In the ﬁnals of_ last year's 130-pound class,

Steenlage decisioned Panther Mike Johnson. On

the way to the title the Cadet,whiz downed Peri-
tore, 1-0, in overtime. Peritore ended up ﬁnish-.
ing third. In their dual meet this year they drew,
1-1. Since they will likely be seeded on opposite
ends of the ladder this weekend, a return match
appears to be guaranteed. -. r ' ,

Penn State’s Jerry Seaman
Combines rai and Brawn

By ALEX WARD
Daily Collegian Sports Editor

Last year Jerry Seaman

was
wrestler in the East. Seaman
was the type who began every
match as if there were no to-
morrow—-—or rather, no third p_er-
iod. Equipped with amazing
strength and a ﬁery disposition,
he would go all out for the ﬁrst
six minutes of his matches and,
if he hadn't pinned his man by
that time, would hang on for
dear life in the third round.

Seaman had pretty good suc-
cess with this system too, until
tournament time rolled around.
Entering the Easterns with a 6-3
record, he was considered one of
the favorites to win the 167-
pound title. But his hell—bent for
leather tactics burned him out
and he lost in the ﬁnals to Jeff
Stephens of Cornell.

This year Seaman has been a
changed man. He’s thinking more
and ﬁzzling out less, you might
say. “I had to do something dif-
ferent this year,” he explained.

- “So I started using my head a

little more.” The added brain-
work has paid off handsomely for
the Penn State'junior.

So far this year he has ripped
through nine straight opponents,
including his old nemesis, Steph-

ens, without so much as break-

ing a sweat. His record has gain-
ed him a second team" All-Ameri-
can rating at 160 ‘(behind Bill
Lam of Oklahoma) and the role

‘of ﬁavorite in this year's Eastern

tournament.
Seaman’s coach Bill Koll agrees

with Jerry on the cause of all

the best two-period,

JERRY SEAMAN
State’s Undefeated Wrestler

this success. “Jerry doesn't try
to outmuscle everyone any more,”
says K011. “He plans things more
now and this is what distinguish-
es him from the normal wres-
tler.”

His new style of wrestling has
also given Seaman 3, new outlook
on tournament competition. “You
have to adjust yourself quickly
in tournaments,” says Jerry. “And
that calls for fast thinking. You
have to size up your opponent in
a few seconds and then make
your move. It's no place to start
getting wild.”

The favorite’s position doesn"t
particularly bother Seaman. In
fact, he claims he doesn't even
think about it at all. “I would
never consider myself as the fav-
orite,” he says. “When you be-
gin to think like that you're on

your way down. Anybody can

win this thing and if I’m lying
around daydreaming it certainly
isn't going to be me.”

The chances of Seaman being
caught in a trance during these
next few days is pretty slim,
however. He's worked much too
long and hard for this tourna-
ment to lose everything over a
mental lapse. “We've been train-
ing especially hard these last few
weeks for the tournament,” he
says. “But actually, the Easterns
and Nationals are something you
work for all year long.”

Although Koll ﬁgures Seaman's
toughest competitor for the East-
ern 160 pound crown will be
Stephens again, Jerry disagrees.
“I’m more worried about the
guys I haven’t wrestled this sea-
son,” he says. “I’ve already been
up against Stephens this year
and I beat him pretty good (9-5).
I’ll admit he's had some tough
luck with injuries this season but
I don’t think he’ll be the man to
beat. Someone I've never heard
of will probably give me the most
trouble.”-

Anyway, Seaman says he’ll be
a little cautious with all of his
opponents in the Easterns.. “I
oan’t make a mistake in this tour-
nament,” says Jerry. “One had
break and I might be out of it.”

K011 concurs, “This is an indi-
vidual thing. If you make a mis-
take there’s not going to be some-
one‘ else on the team to make up
for it. A wrestler is really alone
out there.”

But the Lion coach isn't at all
worried about his star pupil.
“Jerry gives it everything he's
got all the time,” says Koll. “And

,now he’ll be using his head too_’?

Foremost among the prob-
lems that former wrestling
coach Rex Peery faced last
year was finding people to wres-
tle at 191-pounds and heavy-
weight levels. Actually he had
two wrestlers he could use, but
both were football players, and
one got so disgusted with him-

self he quit.

Bill Bodle played halfback and
wrestled as a heavyweight.’ Bill

at 191 before he left the squad.

Peery was desperate for wres-
tlers in those two classes that he
used lighter men, knowing that
they wouldn’t have a chance.
Peery didn’t believe in forfeiting.
M In the Easterns Peery used Al
Traunsteiner (167) as a heavy-
weight. Unfortunately for 'l‘raun-
steiner, he met Jim Nance in the
first round and was pinned in
49 seconds.

The year before, Peery had
recognized what was going to
happen in the upper 'weight—- di-
visions. He went out and recruit-

ed two boys who he hoped would ’

restore some

Their names are Jack Williams
and Terry Hoover. Both are now
sophomores and both will be in
the Easterns Friday. Their com-
bined record is 7-6-2, a_ vast im-
provement over 1-ll.

Williams wrestled at 191 dur-
ing the past year, compiling a
3-2-1 record. Hoover grappled in
the heavyweight category and
came out even?!-4-1.

According to wrestling coach
Dave Johnson, Williams could
very conceiveably do well in 
EIWA. “He has a lot of poten-
tial," Johnson said. “He could be

Wrestler Clair Riley 

Competes with Desire .-

By BILL CABIN

  

(The following article is a feature written after wrestler Clair C
Rileg/’s performance at last year's EI WA tournament. Riley, a senior 
has 4-4-1 record this season and will wrestle in the 152 pound division -..;-_j_J_

in this weekend’s tournament.)

If desire Won wresting matches, Clair Riley would be I 

a champion. Riley has been handicapped mainly by his size
this year, weighing 157 and wrestling in the 167-pound divi-‘V
sion. “But he has made up” an awful lot of that disadvantage 
with heart,” said coach Rex Peery. “He’s a real scrapper.” 

Riley displayed sheer guts while losing a 4-3 overtime 

decision to Lehigh captain Har-
ley Ferguson in the quarter-finals
of the Easterns at Cornell. “The
coach told me we needed the
win," said Riley, “and I was all
psyched-up for the match.”

Although Ferguson had defeat-
ed Riley in-a dual-meet early in
the season and had a ten-pound
weight advantage, Riley's desire
increased. He came out on the
mat wtih mercury-like speed, im-
mediately scoring a predicament
and take down on the befuddled
Ferguson. ‘

“I was up for that match,” said
Riley. “and when he made a mis-
take I got -right on him.” Fergu-
son fought back ﬁercely, tying
the match in the second period.
Riley began the third period with
another burst of speed and re
versed the stunned Ferguson.

Despite Ferguson’s superior
strength, Riley rode him with a
tight waist for two-and-one-half
minutes. Lehigh fans were stupi-
ﬁed and yelled in despair as Fer-
guson failed to elude Riley.

“His size advantage ﬁnally
overcame me,” said Riley in dis-
gust. Ferguson reversed him at
8:30, sending the match into

overtime. Both Riley and Peery —

thought Riley had the necessary
one minute riding time advan-
tage, but he had only 55 seconds.

Ferguson's strength proved de-
cisive in the overtime as he im-
mediately escaped Riley and
scored a take down. Riley main-
tained his desire despite his fa-
tigue. He scored an escape and a
take down in a valiant third per-
iod ﬂurry and Lehigh coach Ger-
ry Leeman jumped up in a state
of frenzy.

“My biggest problem has been
holding a bigger guy,” said Riley,
and that was how he lost as
Ferguson scored a last period es-

 Riley plans to move down. “I

cape. “I had that tight waste on _:;3'i}1?
him,” continued Riley. “but he.  
just outmuscled me in that last __
period.” _  
The loss typified a frustrating  1
year for a determined wrestler.
Riley had an unimpressive 1-5-1
record this season, and gave
away at least ten pounds to each
opponent. Several times oppon-
ents merely overpowered him
and drove his face into the‘mat._
Despite his weight disadvan-
tage and losing record, Riley ‘is V
a skilled wrestler. “He has 
about equal with skills to every-
one of. his opponents,” said Peery.“ I
Riley weighed only 112 pounds"
as a freshman, but has grown six 1
inches since then. “The way_ that
boy has been growing,” C‘ said
Peery, “he’s liable to be a heavy-5 
weight .,by next year.”  - 

 

  
 
   

wrestled at 137 last year and be-‘
gan this year at 147,” he said.‘_
“I’d like to try for a 137 or 147- —-

pound spot next year.” ‘ 

Rules Change

(Continued from Page 5) ._
will shoot hard all the way if they only have to wrestle for’ r

six minutes.

Peery is opposed. “When I started wrestling. we were 
working with the best two out of three 10 minute rounds.
’ Now they want to change it to just six minutes, period. If
that's the way they feel why not reduce the time to thirty ' .
seconds as we now hgavecin gym classes. That way condition-_ -
ing could be eliminated all together.” _ 1

Fans, or lack of fans, speak loudly. Athletic directors,
are known to listen. Look for a rules change sometime in

the not too distant future.

“My problem," Johnson con-
tinued, “is to try to make him
want to be one of the best. The
physical potential is there. But
the desire to be at the top is
somewhat lacking."

The Easterns may be just the
thing that will spur Williams.
Earlier in the season, he drew
with Ellery Seitz in a dual meet
at Penn State. Seitz is a senior
who placed third in the Easterns
last year.

“It was a 1-1 draw,” Johnson
recalled. “But it never should
have been that close. Williams
should have beaten him. It seem-
ed ;that he actually wanted the
draw rather than the win.

‘:‘Sometimes that's the right
way to wrestle,” Johnson added.

hind by 15 points.” " A

Williams missed three meets if
because of an arm iniury. Now ‘
that the iniury has healed for:
the Easterns, Johnson feels that
the competition could be con-'
quered by Williams. He'll be up
against Guido Carloni of Navy;
Bob Buchwald from Cornell, and",
Seltz from State.

Hoover wrestles in a ‘division,
that has no defending champion’
because of the graduation 611
heavyweight king Nance. “Hoov-=
er has come a long way this sea‘,

position will come from John

Dave Shidemantle was the
Panther gym squad’s only
winner 5 in last weekend’s
Eastern Intercollegiate Gym
 nastics League champion-
,__,ships. For Shidemantle, this
;competition was his ﬁfth meet 0f
if the year. After the second dual
" -[meet of the season, Shidemantle
5 dislocated his elbow in practice-

1 Even when Shidemantle return-
ed to the gymnast’s lineup, he
"couldn't perform on the rings.
,. horizontal bar, or side horse. The
V- only events Shidemantle could
jg-work were the trampoline and
;. long horse vaulting. Considering
,;-this, Shidemantle’s victory-in the
long horse vaulting was a great
.accomplishmerTl:— He is unique
among Panther athletes this year,
‘he is a winner.

Shidemantle thought the EIGL
._champiOnShip was a tremendous
meet. “I’ve seen the last three
"championship meets; this has
7-been the best.This was the closest
"competition I’ve ever been in.”

_ Despite the attraction of two
.’of the country’s top gymnasts.

Steven Cohen of Penn State and
Mark Cohn of Temple, and some
of _the best gymnastic squads in
the nation, the attendance at the
EIGL meet was comparatively
poor. Part of the. reason is the
low state of gymnasticsat Pitt.

Shidemantle explained the gym-
nast’s plight this way. “We need
gymnasts to improve. With the
bad season we’ve had the last

i few years, it’s going to be hard.
When you're down it's hard to
get up.”

Shidemantle worked all-around
in high school. He performed
high school gymnastics at Butler,
Pa., High, as did teammates, Jim
Sacco and Dave McKinnis, and

: Lone W

has high hopes for next season.
“I'd like to go back to working
the all-around. If I don't get hurt
again, I should have a pretty
good season. I think the team as

A a whole will have a much better

season. It’s not too hard to im-
prove on a 4-7 season.” ,
In two weeks, Shidemantle, b

virtue of his victory in the EIGL
competition, will be competing in
the regionals. If he wins here,
Shidemantle would go on to the
national championships. “I think
I have a good chance of winning
in the regionals. From what I’ve
heard, the competition won’t be
as keen as it was in the East-
erns.”" 1

WAKE ME WHEN IT’S OVER‘

The trouble with early morning classes is that you’re too
sleepy. At late morning classes you’re too_ hungry. At early
afternoon classes you’re too logy. At late afternoon classes
you’re too hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well
face it—there is no good time of day to take a class.

What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy?
I say no! I say America did not become the hope of man-
kind and the world’s largest producer of butterfats and tal-
low by running away from a ﬁght!

If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then
let's hold classes when you’re not too hungry or sleepy:
namely, while you’re eating or sleeping. .

- Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lec-
turer lec-ture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy
foods. I meanvwho can hear a lecturer lecture when every-
body is crunching celery or matzo or like that? Serve quiet
stuff —like anchovy paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls
of lamb fat.

Now let us turn to the problem of learning while sleep-
ing. First, can it be done? ‘

Yes, it can. Psychologists have proved‘ that the brain is
"deﬁnitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take,
for instance, a recent experiment conducted by ‘a leading
Eastern university (Stanford); A small tape recorder was
placed under the pillow of the subject, ‘a freshman named’
Wrobert Wright. When Wrobert was fast asleep, the re-
corder was turned on. Softly, all through the night, it re-
peated three statements in‘ Wrobert’s slumbering ear:

1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109 and is called
“The Founder of English Eclectic Philosophy.”

h  The banana plant is not a tree but alarge perennial

er .  .

3. The Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 at
Sarajevo by a young nationalist named Mjilas Cvetnic,
who has been called “The Trigger of World War I.”

 

When Wrobertawoke in the morning, the psychologists
said to him, “Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109. What
is he called?” - .

Wrobert promptly answered, “Perennial Herb.”

Next they. asked him, “What has Mjilas Cvetnik been

' called?”

Wrobert replied, “Perennial Serb.”

Finally they said, “Is the banana plant a tree?”

“To be honest,” said’ Wrobert, “I don't know too much
about bananas. But if you gents want any information

I about razor blades, I’m your man.”'

A '."¢"d.:.1.’?...-.~9.:- (1.?  .1.

“Well,” said the psychologists, “can you tell us a blade
that shaves closely and cleanly without nicking, pricking,
scratching, scraping, scoring, gouging, grinding, ﬂaying or
ﬂensing?” i _

“Yes, I can,” said Wrobert. “Personnas” Stainless Steel
Blades. Not only does Personna give you a true luxury
shave, but it gives you heaps and gobs and bushels and

barrels of true luxury shaves—each one nearly as truly lux-

urious as the first.”

“Land’s sake l” said the psychologists.

“Moreover,” said Wrobert, “Personna is available not
only in the Double Edge style blade, but also in the Injec-
tor style blade.” ‘

“Great balls ofiﬁrel” said the psychologists. .

‘‘So why don't you rush to your dealer and get some
Personnas at once?’ said Wrobert. ’

“We will,” said the psychologists, twinkling, “but there
is something we have to do ﬁrst.”

Whereupon they awarded Wrobert an honorary L.L.B.
(Lover of Luxury Blades) degree, and then, linking arms,
they sang and danced and bobbed for apples till the camp-
ﬁre had turned to embers. r

» Losing Season Hurts Szyl<o<wny’sFuture

'~/-

 

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Eastern collegiate basket-
ball hasn’t boasted of so
many exceptional backcourt
men for quite some time. Sub-
merged somewhere in this crop-
is Larry Szykowny.

It’s impossible to determine
where he ﬁts in. The proscouts
probably haven’t noticed him,
and the sports writers who deter-
mine All-East selections probably
haven’t either. That’s what hap-
pens when a ﬁne ballplayer plays
on a team that wins five games
out of 22.

But opposing coaches praised
Szykowny during the season. Mel
Cratsley of Carnegie Tech called
him “a great ballplayer.” Tem-
ple’s Harry Litwack stressed
Szykowny’s offensive ability by
labeling him “a good shooter.”

Lou Carnessca from St. John’s
pointed out that Szykowny was
“a defensive standout.” Bucky
Walters, the ﬂamboyant West Vir-
ginia coach considered him “a
great athlete who nearly killed
us with his scoring.”

Coach Walters indirectely noted
Szykowny’s current problem when
he said “nearly killed us.” The

Panther basketball team didn’t
win.

“I would like to try out for the
pros,” Szykowny said. “But they
look at the record of the team
you’re on, and being on a loser

All Szykowny wants is achance
at the NBA. “It would be tough
to make a team, I realize that,”
he said. “Ca-1 Sheffield had a shot

was a better shooter than I am.”

Of course, Szykowny does more
on a basketball court than shoot.
It’s the defense, the working of
the ball on offense, the general
hustle that makes Szykowny stand-
out.

Playing on a team that lost 33
games in two years, Szykowny
might have had some misgivings
about coming here. “No, I was
happy to start for those two
years,” he said. “It was better
than sitting on the bench”.

U. S. Senate Proposal
Aids Student’s Taxes

A new proposal to ease the
ﬁnancial burden of all col-
lege students will soon be
brought before the United

States Senate. This concept,
explained in the Ribicoff-Domin-
ick bill, has two basic features:
the gift tax credit and the tui-
tion tax credit.

The gift tax credit permits a
credit against the Federal in-
come tax of anyone making a
gift to a college or university.
This money would be used in
maintaining and improving the
physical plant and in setting‘up
scholarship funds. The $500 mil-
lion aid to higher education in
1962-63 could easily be doubled
in future years because every
taxpayer could become a poten-
tial philanthropist if the tax cred-
it was, say, 80 per cent of the
gift.

The second concept, tuition tax
credit, permits a complete deduc-
tion of up to $325 from the Fed-
eral income tax of persons pay-
ing for tuition fees, books, and
supplies of college students. Un-
like the $600 deduction for de-
pendents, this will be a dollar
for dollar deduction from the ac-
tual tax. Since taxpayers will be
allowed credit when they pay
tuitions for any student, new

sources of scholarships will be
created.

Under the Ribicoff Bill, the
credit is based on the first $1,500
of expenses for each student at
any institution of higher learn-
ing. The amount of credit is 75
per cent of the first $200, 25 per
cent of the next $300, and ten per
cent of the next $1,000. The maxi-
mum credit is $325.

SU Offices
Available

Applications for office space
are now available in the Student
Union for use by student organi-
zations during the coming aca-
demic year. All organizations pre-
sently having offices in the Stu-
dent Union must re-apply at this
time in addition to organizations
seeking office space for the ﬁrst
time.

Organizations holding office‘
space must be recognized by the
University Committee on Recog-
nition of Organizations. Space
will be alloted on the basis of
need for an office, the use to be
made of the office, and the or-
ganization’s need for maintain-
ing a regularly staffed office.

Applications for office space are
available at the Student Union
Desk through April 1. Notice of
the allocation of space will be
given at the close of the winter
trimester in order that the or-
ganizations might be located in
an office prior to the opening
of the fall trimester.
