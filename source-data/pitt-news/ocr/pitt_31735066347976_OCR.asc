The original version of“ the
controversial report- on the campus
police has been destroyed, accord-
ing to Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Myron Skra-
bu/t,.who said his office frequently
does not save commissioned stud-
ies once they have been evaluated
and/or summarized.

A three page summary of recom-
mendations culled from the original
approximately 100 page document

 “was released last week.

“We used the document for its
purposes--to advise management--

referring to the complete report.

number of studies in the past_ in
many areas. We took from then
what we wanted and filed them in
the trash.

“This was a common admi‘nistra— "

tive practice, it wasn't an unusual
act," he said. “This case just
happens to be in the limelight
because ‘it's security and concerns
people's daily lives."

Denying that disposal of the
document constituted a cover-up of
any kind, Skrabut told the Pitt
News the report contained “tons
and tons of narrative to back’ up
information contained in the three’
page summary released to the
public.

at first, a survey by the Resident
Student Association later indicated
the majority of residents favored
the continuation of 24 hour securi-

Under the present system in the
Towers, identification must be

‘shown before being admitted past

the lobby, from 7:30 pm to 3:30 am
Monday through Thursday, from
7:30 pm to 5:30 am Fridays and
Saturdays, and from 7:30 pm to
1:30 am on Sundays. Fonseca,
Marcus and Chief of ‘Campus
Police Curt Graham all agreed that
these were the hours when security
is most crucial. I i -. 0
Another factor considered in the

security cutback, Fonseca said, -is.

the high volume of students pas-
sing through the Towers lobby to
the cafeteria below Towers A and
C. Students from the Towers and
the Quadrangle who have food
service contracts eat their meals in
the Towers cafeteria. All of the
residents in both these dorm areas
also pickup their mail in the
Towers lobby. .-
' "Even if the expense were of no
concern, the logistical disadvan-
tages of maintaining. around~the-
clock‘ security would create bottle-
necks in the Towers lobby during
periods of peak activity." Marcus
said. _

While the 24-hour security was in
effect, admittance to the Towers
could be gained only by presenting
an ID to the guard at the door.

however.‘ , _

‘The report named names, and
we know with these things‘ if
they're made public, a page could
easily be lifted out of context and
misinterpreted.

“It was not written in a style that
led me to believe the men ‘who

and specific individuals were cited.

and doing hard work than worrying
about their participles dangling
and getting their syntax straight.

“It was not the impression of this

Action Society (BAS) Chairperson
Graylyn Swilley. _

“Porter has the support of the

The black studies department has
been without a permanent head

‘since the resignatin of Jack Daniel,

over a year ago. Since that timeia
search committee has narrowed
list of hundreds to
applicants to three candidates, on
which Porter appears to the be
front runner. _

“The search committee voted on
the three ﬁnal candidates using a
rating scale,” Swilley said.

“Porter received 19. points, the
person. below him got nine.
faculty also voted in favor of Porter
25-21." A spokesman from the

the easiest solution to a variety of
problems. The claim of privilege is
a useful way of hiding inefficiency,

officials.”

Cox proposed that legislation be
enacted which would provide for
judicial enforcement of a congress-
ional subpoena directed to the
President or any other ofﬁcer in the
Executive Branch in every case in
which either the Senate or the
House votes to override the
Executive’s objections, provided
the information is relevant to a
matter which is actively under
inquiry and within the jurisdiction
of the body issuing the subpoena.

Cox -noted two constitutional
obstacles which are currently under
debate. In United States v. Nixon
Chief Justice Warren Berger stated
that the privilege of confidentiality
is fundamental to the operation of
government and is inextricably
rooted in the separation of powers
under the Constitution to the extent
this interest relates to the effective
discharge of the President’s
powers it is constitutionally based.

Cox stressed the vague language

,of the Chief Justice’s words, and

said, “There are many cases in
which Congress has the constitu-.
tional authority to institute meas-
ures that interfere ' with the
‘effective discharge of ‘a Presi-
dent’s powers’, either by legisla-
tion signed by the President or by
enacting a statute over the
President’s veto.

It is entirely possible, therefore,
that the Supreme Court, if squarely
confronted with the question,
might explain away the assertions
in US v. Nixon or confine them to
situations in which there is no
applicable legislation.

“It is harder to ﬁnd an acceptable
technique for holding that a statute
can impose upon the President a
legal obligation to comply with any
subpoena voted by either the
Senate or the House but cannot
give the same force_~ to any,
subpoena issued by a committee
acting pursuant to a delegation of
power--a measure which I would

‘ regard as exceedingly dangerous.”

Cox suggested the Court might
state although ‘a measure vesting
such a power in a single committee
carried excess threat to the
effective functioning of the presi-
dency and thus threatened the
basic principle of the separation of
powers, still there was no
comparable danger where the
subpoena was voted by the Senate
or the House. In either case, Cox

said, “The pronouncement would
be a judicial tour de force, but
sometimes a tour de force is none
the worse for that."

It is important to emphasize the
increasing power and isolation of
the Presidency--of the White
House establishment--at the ex-
pense of the institutionalized
departments and agencies, Cox
said.

“What had been lacking was a
dramatic symbol of the dangers
inherent in the institutional devel-
opment--perhaps I should say a

-dramatic issue upon which to

challenge the slow but overwhelm-
ing increase of Presidential power
and the. increasing secrecy of
Presidential actions.

Detailing some of the factors that
inﬂuenced his actions as Special
Prosecutor, Cox said, “Who could
say that if one President succeeded
in deﬁance of legal constraints,
others might not follow the
example until ours was no longer a

In the question and answer perio
following Cox’s speech downtown i
yesterday to Pittsburgh law pro- 3.
fessionals and students, the issue
of the constitutionality of Ford’s
pardoning of Nixon was raised.

Several people contended that,
according to Article II, Section 2, of
the Constitution, a president has
the power to grant pardons in all
cases except impeachment.

Cox replied, “The granting of a
pardon in advance was a very grave A
mistake, but I don’t have any real’
doubt that it was within Ford’s
power.

Graham and Fonseca both noted
the role of the urban environment

He cited the traffic in drugs as one
example, where the money in- '
volved in the transactions is an
invitation to robbery and theft in
the dorms. Such drug-relat_ed
crimes obviously cannot be repor-
ted because the victim would be
admitting his own guilt in a crime.
Graham said the students will have
to decide how much, and what
type, of -security will be employed.

A state abortion law which gives
husbands or parents veto power
over a \\'om'.in's desire to have an
abortion has been criticized as

"dreadfully unconstitutional and
discriminatory" by women's rights
groups, but applauded by anti—a—
bortionists as “the first step toward
a human right to life law."

The bill was passed September

activities might jeopardize its at-
tempts to correct the problem.
,Skrabut said his office did not
consider including examples of
such alleged activities in the sum-
mary. “We did not feel making this
public would serve any purpose,"
he said. “We would rather work
to clean up any problems opera-
tionally." "

Campus Police Chief Curt Gra-
ham, one of the few officials to see

ta: the entire report, said it did‘ not

mention any names in the individ-
ual instances. “The report was
done in very good taste,” Graham
said. “It did not name names. I'm
trying to think of an individual
instance where l‘d want to file
charges, and 1 can't come up with
one.

"Commission member Stanley

Gorski, now a lieutenant with the
campus police, could not confirm or
deny any reported illicit activities
mentioned in the study, claiming,
“I just don't remember." Gorski
asserted, however, that no names
were mentioned in the document.
Asked whether he knew of what
the University had planned for the
report, Gorski said, “That's not our
responsibility. Once we turned the
thing in to the vice chancellor’s
office we were done with it."
Executive Assistant to the Chan-
cellor Ray Coble said he hadn’t

seen the report and did not know it
had been destroyed. “This is the
first thing I've heard about it," he
said. "The Chancellor hadn't ‘seen
it to my knowledge. Of course, it
was not commissioned for his use,
but as an internal document for the
vice chancellor’s office.

“lt’s not unusual for universities
or large organizations to destroy
certain things, such as personnel
data and confidential material once
their purpose has been served,”
Coble said.

Skrabut said, “We’ve made tre-
mendous progress in other depart-
ments under our jurisdiction, such
as the registrar and student ac-
counts, streamlining these areas by
bringing in consultants and imple-
menting their recommendations
without pointing a finger at indi-
viduals publicly.

"What makes security different is i

that it's the tip of an iceberg of
operational problems, since it con-
cerns people's daily lives.

“We're laying no blame at the
feet of the men, but blaming
ourselves for any problems caused
by a lack of administrative leader-
ship. This is our responsibility."

The report was compiled by
Gorski, attorney Gerry Bigley and
former Campus Police Chief Robert

. Fadzen over a seven month period;

during which dozens of policemen,
faculty members and students were
interviewed.

l0, when the State Senate and
House over-rode Governor Milton
Shapp’s veto. Shapp had said’ the
bill violated women’s constitutional
rights.

the new law, which becomes
elfective mid—0ctober, aims to halt
the work of illegal "butchers" by
requiring abortions be performed

in hospitals under proper medical,

supervision. It will also forbid
abortion referral agencies from
tidvertising or charging fees.

These aspects of the bill have

ween generally hailed as necessary
and beneficial. The controversial
parts of the ‘bill are provisions that:
1) give the husband, or parents in

the case of women under 18, veto
power over abortions (single wo-
men over 18 would not be affected);
2) prevent the state from paying for
abortions for women on welfare,
. except for health reasons; and 3) (
ban abortions after the fetus is
considered’ “viable" -- able to live
apart from the mother.

“This bill is dreadful and illegal,”
says Leah Sayles, Executive Direc-
tor of Women’s Health Services,
lnc., a non-profit clinic in Pitts-
burgh that has performed over
10,000 abortions in the past 1‘/2
years.

“It circumvents the Supreme
Court decision which prevents gov-
ernmental instrusion into the right
of women whether or not to
terminate a pregnancy.

“Governor Shapp was right when

he called the,bill ‘utterly and
completely unconstitutional.’ Laws
like this have been challenged and
won in other states. Our attorneys
are already working on it.

"This will put the butchers back
in business," continued Sayles. “It
discriminates against poor women,
while the rich can get abortions just
like before."

 Gerald Ford’s anmesty plan granting conditional amnesty
to persons who evaded the draft or deserted the military during the
Vietnam War not only fails to fulﬁll its expressed aim, the uniﬁcation of
e American people, but it is, also, grossly unfair to those who have

Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mark Vemallis, and Fraternity
President, George Kostelnick, had
been extremely influential
through-out the summer in con-

vincing the Student Affairs staff to‘
re-evaluate its position on the case. i

The article further implied that it
was the “hard work” of thes’e,,two
during the summer months that
resulted in eventual rectiﬁcation of
the problem (during the early
weeks of Sept.) This is not true.

From the time that Delta Sigma
Chi ﬁrst became involved in this
controversy in late June, until the

‘ time that school opened in early

September, neither Vernallis or
Kostelnik bothered-to schedule any

meetings with the Student Affairs ‘

staff to discuss this problem, nor
did they bother to send any letters
explaining their philosophy.

The fact is that most of the work in

this case, was done by Pitt News.
' Editor Tom Smith and several
members of the Student Govern-'

ment Board. It was their diligent
efforts through-out the summer,
that brought about the eventual
solution to the problem.

Cmmilmlism on the move

Tl1eVVorst Story Ever Told

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

We woke up one morning to find
a green-eyed _ Changeling in the
White House, grinning and snick-
ering in the President’s chair. Gone
forever was the comfortable, knob
of the Old Nixon.

This new creature had fangs, and
red scaly arms. It gibbered the
fascist lingo of total control, secret
police forces’ and corruption.

No transformation in any gothical
pulp story was quite as horrible and
shuddery.

We had to destroy it. The
loathsome thing squirmed under
the stake, and we wondered how
such a thing ever found it’s way to
the heart of our nation.

The foul transformation had not,

gone unheralded. There had been
omens. One of them came to a
sm_a_ll New England town the night
of the "Watergate burglary in
Washington DC. A few took heed
and moved to Canada...

The police found him in a dead

captured the ess -once of the

later. It was Horatio, spinning in

At exactly the same hour as this

were caught in the act
ransacking the Democratic Head-
quarters at the Watergate Com-
plex.

Thus the ﬁrst granule of the
Watergate Avalanche gathered

force to destroy the dreams of

Richard M. Nixon, the incarnation
of Alger’s smalltown boys who

Just what small town did this kid
come from?

THE WEST AND
GENETIC INSANITY

- Manifest Destiny dragged our
nation clear across an ' entire
continent, over the rubble of
several less vicious cultures, a few
mountain ranges and one or two
thresholds of compassion.

The people who swarmed west
were certainly notrthe stable, the
decent or the normal. They were
the restless, the grabbers, the men
with visions.

These berserk pioneers burst out
into the uncharted wilderness of
this nation in pursuit of More. They
were driven by a hunger for more
more land, more of

the way. They were stripped of
their belongings and the march
continued. \ .

There are a fe_w documented cases

of cannibalism during the Great

Rush West, grim manifestations of
the real American tradition (more
of this , later). Finally, having.
overcome the Spanish, these crazy
visionaries" and grabbers hit -the
Paciﬁc Ocean. T
Luckilyfor marine life, they were

' unequipped with gills, and so this

strange tribe. of nuts and over-a-
chievers was forced to settle down
to boil and churn. on the West
Coast.

The/ﬁncestral craving for More

of-

must be genetic by now. From
generation to generation the
insanity lives on.

Nixon’s California is where little
men become rich men, and little
girls from Oklahoma become movie
stars and commit glamorous
suicide. The atmosphere of mad-
ness and howling lust presses the
landscape. There are cities of
illusion there, ﬁlled with auto-
mated elves and bouncing Mickey
Mouses.

.The population struggles like

restrained lemmings, taking sav-
age joy in knowing someday soon
the San Andreas Fault will slip, and
cast them all into the unlit ocean
abyss. ,

The children of course inhale this
vapour of greed, insanity and
instinctive lust. So how did Ricky
Nixon fare?

A THE HERITAGE or RICKY’
NIXON

Richard Nixon was a success. He
was the epitome of our American
rags-to-riches legends.

The Vikings had Beowulf. The
Romans had Aeneas. And we have
Horatio Alger’s fictional characters
who got to-the top. Nixon’s rise
from the subterranean middle class

' to the Presidency is an epic of the

American free-enterprise system.
If we zoom back to when Ricky

' was a poor kid [as poor kids go] in
’ California,

we hear stories of
ﬁnancial insecurity, about Rick’s
brother dying in his arms. Nixon’s
credentials as a disadvantaged
person are indisputable. '

Unlike some disadvantaged
youths, Nixon determined to ﬁnd a
place in the System. -‘And no
institution means the system like
the Republican party.

Young Nixon wanted to be the
Republican’s Republican--to be on
1. 3 inside. He wanted to join all the
secret clubs .with the funny hats
and handshakes. He wanted to be
behind all the closed doors.

If Ricky had been _born in the
Middle Ages, he would have been a
sorcerer, a harmless dabbler in the
occult. As fate would have it,
though, Richard Nixon became a
politician. ' -

Following his heart’s desire,
Nixon eventually clawed a path to
the White House and became a
president of the United States. The

[dormant monster stirred’  the

heart of the nation. ~ ~ 

How did...‘ e everilet him get so
close? Why did Nixon attempt to
subvert the Constitution, to control
the law as a tool of his ambition and
guilt?

Perhaps a lot of it has to do with
the mental processes of the

on-campus publicity. The club had
requested $2,340.

In a budget presented to the
Allocations Committee, the Hockey
Club predicted expenses for

the year, "including ice rental,
Civic Arena rental, travel expen-
ses, supplies, and publicity, to be
$5,900. The club expected to raise
$3,650 of this on their own-through
admission prices and fund-raising
activities. I

The Hockey Club budget also

included a $1,300 debt held over
from last year.

The $1,040 given the Hockey Club
by SG is meant to cover all of the
expected expenses except the debt.

Charles Hagins, president of the
Hockey Club, was not satisfied with
the partial funding. “The chances
are we -are going to lose the team
this year,” he said.

The lone dissenting vote in the

ballot to fund the Hockey Club
was cast by Board member Bruce

Keeler. Keeler said he was in favor
of funding the organization this
year, but held out for a stipulation
that no funds would be given to the
Hockey Club next year. i

“This,” Keeler explained,
“would put a lot of pressure on
everybody involved to get the‘
people up’ in Trees Hall to fund
this."

Keeler’s proposal was rejected.

After lengthy debate, the SGB
decided to wait until their next
meeingl to acton a request by A

group, for $3,548.

Members of the counseling
organization who were at the
meeting blamed. lack of funds to
properly publicize the program for

their alleged lack of effectiveness.

Furick, along with other board
members, questioned the ability of
this group to function properly
without any formally trained
personnel.

“I have to question whether your
people have the education to
handle a suicide call. You might
tell them something wrong,”
Furick said.

ALHFYF spokesperson replied
that the group holds regular
training meetings along with
intensive training for all rookie
personnel. They also cited
Western Psychiatric Institute psy-
chiatrist,Paul Scotti, the pharmacy
school, and Legal’ Awareness,
as consultants who enable them to
lend professional advice when
necessary.

When asked if the group
duplicates services already offered
by local counseling units, Alexis

‘Samulski, an ALHFYF member,
said the group was the only
organization in Pittsburgh which
will ‘temporarily house out-of-
towners. “There is no other place
they can go to," she said. “We are
the only one to take them in.”

Board member Paul Hertneky
criticized the Allocations Commit-
tee for recommendn g the group not
be funded. --

“I’m embarassed that the com-

mittee would rely on some slip-'

shod survey. We don't know e-
nough about how this organization
functions to decide to deny them
the function of their organization,"
he maintained. Hertneky also cited
the “massive amount of dedica-
tion" in the group, comparing it to
many lesser dedicated groups
which had been allocated funds.

with the French Department.

Suites with kitchen facilities are .

available for coed living.

“They are in the experimental
stage,” Fonseca said, “-But are
working out very well.” More may
be created if students with special
interests request them. ,

Fonseca also wants to “raise the
professionalism" of his staff, which

includes 78 student Resident As-
sistants (RA's), 4 Area Coordin-
ators who supervise the RA’s, and
two secretaries. Assistant Directors
JoAnn Woodson and Timothy Sny-
der will be working with him. I

Fonseca’s qualiﬁcations include
four years experience in the hous-
ing office of Illinois State Universi-
ty at Normal, where he worked in
programming. He received under-
graduate and graduate degrees in,
counseling from the same school.

“Three years ago the Office‘ of
Residence Life was part of the
Housing Office. Now it is under the
Office of Student Affairs under Dr.
Moye,” said Fonseca.

The Housing Office now deals
only with the “operational as-
pects" of residence life such as
food services and the housekeeping
and maintenance of the buildings.

Fonseca’s programming budget is
approximately $1 per student for
about 3500 resident students, but
he said other funds are available.

Fonseca hopes to make dorm life
more comfortable and more rele-
vant to student needs. “I'm inter-
ested in making the dorms‘ more
realistic,” he said. “In this I’m
pointing directly to the Towers --
I’d like to make them'more livable.

“I’d like to create a coed living
unit on the same ﬂoor with maybe a
separate bathroom. I don’t feel the
coed units as they now exist (in the
Towers and MCNR) are really
coed."

' Fonseca is open to student input,
and said he is especially interested

in working with the Student Gov»

ernment Board [SGB], the Resident
Student Association [RSA], and
various other student committees.

7Fonseca had some thoughts about
the relationship of dormitory stu-
dents and the Oakland community.
“Where the school is located in
Oakland does set some overtones
for what goes (in in the resident
halls,” he said. T‘There is no
immediate ,fear of the Oakland
community, but my staff and" I do
warn students to think twice before

going out on the streets at 4 am.”-

Security is necessary to keep out
certain “undesirables” he said.
"We wouldn't need guards if

Oakland was safe. But security is
expensive. We can't secure these
buildings all the time. We provide
security when incidents may occur,
such as when the bars are open.
The security in the dorms is
adequate until proven otherwise."

Fonseca has mixed emotions a-
bout c_ity and county police entering
the dorms for arrests. He said he
recognized the police have juris-
diction to enforce the law on the
campus as well as off it.

“When they take action, they
have no obligation to tell me or the
campus police," he said.

Fonseca views his new position as

“a real challenge.” He said, ‘‘I left
a lot of security at Illinois State
University. When I started, the
interviewing process I didn’t really
care if I got the job. But by the end
I had gone from not caring to
wanting the job very much.”

Fonseca was chosen from a group
of six candidates after a series of
interviews with head residents,
RA's, students, and Student Af-
fairs Officials.

‘‘I’m not sure yet I want to live all
my life in Pittsburgh. But from
what I've heard and what I've seen,
I_ think l’ll like Pitt."

‘Husband’ Abortion Bill:

Liberation vs. /Vlurcler

(Contimzed from Page 3),

Knepper said he voted for the bill
because he felt his constituency
wanted him to. "I yoted the will of
the people, who in my district are
mostly conservative and Catholic..
My vote‘ does not coincide with my
own personal feelings on the issue.
I don't feel we should go beyond
regulating medical conditions.”

Knepper said the provision in the
bill allowing an abortion if the
pregnancy endangers the life or
health of the woman allows for “a
lot of latitude.” ' V '

“All a woman has to do is get a
certified statement from a doctor
that the pregnancy endangers her
emotional health," he said.

Concerning the requirement that
a woman get consent from her
husband, Knepper said,“I don’t
know which way that will go in the
courts._ It’s bad wording, but I’m
not sure it’s unconstitutional "

Forcing a woman under 18 to go to
her parents, step-parents, or foster
parents for consent might. be a
hardship, said Knepper. “A wo-
man shouldn't have to share her
decision with someone who may
not share herconcern."

The ban on aborting a viable fetus
was seen as vagueiand confusing
by Knepper. “The question of
when there is legal life has not yet
been settled by the medical profes-
sion," he said. “There's a lot of
question as to when a fetus is
viable.” ' -

Karen Gentemann, an active
member in the University Wo-
men’s Center, a social and educa-
tional organization for women with
interest in women’s rights, said
“We will support opposition to the
bill. The health standards and the

ban on paid referrals are good, but ;

the rest of the bill discriminates
against married women, women

We’re confident the bill will be
declared unconstitutional.

“The legislators were advised“-the
law would be declared unconstitu-
tional, but they took the easy. way
out and passed 'it to look good,”
she said.

Gentemann added that the W0-

New Pgh. Choral:

Wenk’s Camerata  

A new choral organization, the
Pittsburgh Camerata, will appear
on the musical-scene this fall under
the direction of Arthur Wenk, a
recently-appointed Assistant Pro-
fessor of Music at Pitt. The

M ensemble of 24 mixed voices will

perform a wide range of choral
music from Bach to Bartok, from‘
plainsong to Stravinsky. The
Christma concert,which the group
expects to present a number of
times in the Pittsburgh area, is
titled “O Great Mystery,” and will
focus mainly on music of the
Renaissance period. A spring
program, “Songs of Love and
lnnocence,” will consist entirely of
20th century music.

The Pittsburgh Camerata will
rehearse each Monday evening
from 7:30 to 9:45. Openings

remain fro altos, tenors and basses.

The exhibit is accompanied by a

by Dr. Carl Nordenfalk, Andrew C.

writes, “Although today consider-
ed Sweden’s most gifted 19th

century artists, Hill and Josephson

never saw their endeavors crowned
with success during their healthy
years....The two of them, however,
became doomed while still young to
pay a higher price for their genius
that what was asked of less gifted
talents.”

there were only ten of them.

 Winstan Leads Arkansas

AP --_ “What about Dennis Win-
ston?" someone asked Arkan-
sas coach Frank Broyles after the
Razorbacks’ 22-7 upset of Southern
California Saturday night.
"Dennis got the game ball for
what he did, that's what about
Dennis Winston,” Broyles replied
emphatically.

What Winston did was make 12
solo tackles and assist on four
others as a rugged Arkansas
defense put the clamps on

I. Southern Cal’s high powered

offense. .
For his nerformance, Winston, a

6-foot-2, 218-pound sophomore
linebacker from Marianna, Ark.,
was named National College
Lineman of the Week by the
_Associated Press.

The only people unhappy about
Winston’s play were the Southern
Cal team...a_nd Winston himself.
“I’m not satisfied with the way I
played,” he said. “I missed three
or four tackles. I could have had
Anthonly Davis in the backﬁeld a
couple of times, but I missed him.
I’ll never be satisfied with the way I
play until Coach Horton tells me I
did 100 per cent, the very best I can
do.’

Winston did 84 per cent against
Southern Cal, a ﬁgure that might
rival 100 per cent anywhere else.
“That’s a real high grade for me,” I
said linebacker coach Harold Hor-
ton. “I feel I’m real critical with
grad-es.*_ As far as I’m concerned,
84 percent is a heck of an

‘ accomplishment.’ ’

Winston helped set the tone of the
game early. On Southern Cal’s
first possession, the‘ Trojans

V marched from their own 35 to the

Arkansas six yard line, but.ﬂ
Winston and tackle Brison’Manor "“'

. threw quarter back Pat Haden for a

three yard loss.

The Pitt football team will travel
to Atlanta, Georgia this week to
take on the Georgia Tech Yellow
Jackets in a -Saturday’ afternoon
contest. The Ramblin’ Wreck is
currently rebuilding their football
program under their new» head
coach Pepper Rodgers who has
stirred up a wave of enthusiasm
which is sweeping through the

South and reviving the exciting"

Georgia Tech tradition.

The Panthers will have their work
cut out for themwhen they take to
the turf in Grant Fi_eld,_to‘nlt rrqw.
Georgia Tech ‘is '1-1 this season i_, ,
having dropped their opener to
Notre Dameby a 31-7 count before
coming back last Saturday to”-
overpower South Carolina 35-20.
The Yellow Jackets set a school
record for yards rushing in this
game by compiling a total of close

_to 500 yards running out of the
newly installed wishbone attack
Pepper Rodgers brought with him
from UCLA. » ‘

The heart of Tech’s powerful
wishbone is quarterback Danny.
Myers who completed three’ of ﬁve
passes last week and rushed for 108
yards and two touchdowns. Myers

septtember 20, 

It was generally admitted by most Pitt football authorities at the
beginning season that the ﬁrst two games (FSU and Georgia Tech)
would be the most important for Johnny Majors & Co., primarly
because the home opener is against Southern Cal and the Cats would
need two strong tests and two subsequent victories to be prepared for
the Trojans. ‘ . . G

I had been all prepared to explain how Pitt would win these three
games and,.in particular, tomorrow’s contest against Tech, but in

Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Penn St. [top contenders] or Ohio St. nor
Michigan- ‘ ‘ ~ .A

The teams they play have 20 to 15 .to- 1 odds against. Navy, Army,
Air Force, Syracuse [etc.]! The only challenges are ‘

5 to 1 against Georgia Tech [if it’s hot!]
2-to 1 BEST against U.S.C. ' '
4to1against PITT. ' I ' .

Thursday's mail I received a letter from an unknown Majors fan from

deep in the backwoods of Alabama (of all places.)

So, without hesitation, I present the following literary [?] work,
.untouched by the proofreaders’ pen, so that you might share in the

Bryant’s most ardent admirers.

football philosophy and wisdom _of who has to be one of “Bear”

Dear Pitt--Get in shape you all! [Ya’ll]

, Friends, we consider you all friends because we know and love
Johnny Majors, who was a great football player at U. Tenn. And we
like the Brave way you all played Notre Dame last year. » Your tailbak
[Dorsey?] is great. So is your offensive line and blocking backs.

, The odds against anyone upsetting Notre Dame this year are 10-];

Due to weak scheduling and lack of opposition. —

If you want to upset them you must ‘sparingly use’ your critical
running back Dorsey and‘ offensive key players, ‘till you meet

-. For the first time in quite a while‘
the Pirates are out of first place.
You really can't tell if you visit the
clubhouse. After Wednesday
night's “must” win over the
Cardinals it was business as usual.
The players were joking and
occasionally letting out ear piercing
screams as Danny Murtaugh
quietly rooked in his chair
answering reporters’ questions.
"_While —the Pirates show no
outward signs of distress they
nonetheless are in second place,
playing catch-up with the Cards.
The Bucs fell to that position after a
road disaster which saw the ‘team
lose live in a row in Philadelphia
and Montreal.

'While the Bucs lost five in a row

winning ﬁve. Added_together that
means the Pirates fell from a 2‘/2
game lock on first place down to
second, I‘/2 games out. Losing the
top spot was trouble enough but
even more problems arose. Dock

his pitching hand while Dave Guisti
was sidelined with back problems.

“I would say Giusti is capable of
pitching," said Manager Danny
Murtaugh. Although physically
healthy now, the relief ace was

sorely missed during the losing

streak as the bullpen often
squandered late inning leads. Why
not use starters in tight relief roles?
Murtaugh indicated the season just
isn’t at that do or die state, yet.
Returning home for the biggest
series of the season against the
Cards the Bucs were hoping to take
all three games. That hope was
quickly set aside as an excellent 13
inning pitching performance by
Jerry Reuss was wasted thanks to a
lack of hitting and a base stealer
named Lou Brock. '
The heartbreaking first game loss
merely set the stage for an
outstanding repeat performance by
two of the league’s most consistent
performers, Jim Rooker aiid Al
Oliver. I .

Dorsett was held to 81 yards last
week against Florida State and will
be out to get his first hundred
yards this week and prove that he
hasn’t lost anything over the
summer. But the strong defensive
front of the Yellow Jackets will be
well prepared for the sophomore
All—American.

One weakness in the Georgia Tech
defense could be the center of the
defensive line. Tony Lubischer,
first-team nose guard, was injured

in Saturda_v’s game as was the
back-up man Joe Malta. It is
unknown whether either of these
players will be ready for tomor-
row’s game but if they are unable
to play, the Ramblin’ Wreck‘ will be
weak up the middle, creating a big
opportunity for Dave Janasek to
gain some ground.

The entire Tech team will be fired
up for their game against Pitt, and
the Pitt defense, which played a
superb game last week, will need
another big effort to pull out a
victory. The offense will need an

improved effort because Tech is a
powerful team and will score a lot
of points if they keep control of the
football.

“It's going to take the most
outstanding _ mental preparation
we've had in some time to. prepare
for the wishbone," said Pitt coach
Johnny Majors earlier in the week
as his team practiced for the
coming game. “Also the offensive
team must take the pressure off the
defense because if we give Georgia
Tech the ball enough times, they're
going to put it in the endzone.”

clear the ball out of the goal crease
and finally Bollie scored.

Bollie’s goal proved to be the final
one for the first half. The halftime

"score was 1-1 as the two teams

rested for the second_ half. ‘

At the beginning of the second
half Pitt's John Morahan passed
brilliantly to John Curley, Ibut
Curley’s shot was caught by the

Point Park goalie.

Minutes later, ’ however, Tom
Murphy connected for Pitt as he
had the opposition's goalie enirely
out of position.

The Cats continued to apply the’

pressure to the Pioneer’s goal, and

after several more shots, Pitt got
another penalty kick in front of
Point Park’s goal. Again Wallace
whizzed the ball past the Pioneer’s
goalie. The score was 3-1 for Pitt,
and it appeared the Panthers were
in , good shape. I '
But then the middle of Pitt's
defense collapsed, as Point Park
scored two goals in succession.
Boni Taylor and Shiek“Jagan each
scored a goal during this time,
and as rapidly as the Panthers had
gone ahead. Point Park had come
back. Jerry Luxbacher ‘of the
Panthers noted the reason for the
two quick Point Park goals was “a
defensive miscue on both plays.”

“We simply didn‘t
have enough players back there (on
defense)."

The Panthers weren’t about to
give up, however. John Curley was
smashed in the eye by a Point Park
player, and was given a penalty
shot. He missed the initial shot,
but booted the rebound passed the
Point Park goalie.

Point Park again scared to tie the ,
game for the third time, on Bollie's 
second goal of the ‘night. The goal
came with about four minutes left
in the game, and the_ pressure
intensiﬁed.

The Panthers handled the pres-

Morahan calmly kicked the ball into

The whole Pitt team agreed it was
an extremely physical game,‘ and, ‘

game, and we had one.”

By no means will it be the

BY ANDY BEHREND

He's just a kid. A country kid at’

that, where the high school
all-stars from his area are good
enough to be called All-Anthracite.

When he was 13 and weighed a
’spindly 130 pounds, realizing he
couldn’t take the licks of football
player must absorb, he vowed to
make the professional football
ranks as a place kicker.

As a junior at North Schuylkill
High, he“ was one of Sports
Illustrated's “Faces in the
Crowd,” honored for kicking
ungodly ﬁeld goals of 42 and 51
yards, “the latter an unofficial
state record” to quote SI.

‘By this time he had thighs like
Romanpillars, and his high school
wanted to bronze his right foot
upon departure.

Now, he is being asked to win big
time college football games with
his foot’s thrust, before 60,000
yelping lunatics in South Bend, or
roughly nine times as many people
as there are back home in Ashland,
PA.

And in this era at Pitt-2 AD (that
is, the secondyear of the coming of
Anthony Dorsett), Carson Long
ﬁnds more people know who he is
 and what he does than he ever

 

dreamed. ~

You all know his past at Pitt—the
blown ﬁeld goal that would have
beaten Georgia in last year's
opener down in peach country, the
school record he set against Navy,
bombing three ﬁeld goals, his 50
yarder at Penn State as the first
half ended.

Even fresher in everyone’s

A memory is the less than auspicious

debut Long had in Tallahasse this
year, against Florida State. He
shanked an extra point (his first
miss in a Pitt uniform, except for

poor snaps from center) and
blundered on. two field goals
attempts.

“I was too anxious to see the first
one go through," Carson admitted.

“My form was good; I just lifted
up my head too soon.”

‘‘I settled down in the locker room
at halftime, made the adjustment
mentally. It should be pointed out
that we did win the game on a ﬁeld
goal.” ‘ _

Yes it was, a 39 yarder that,
accompained with a stingy defense,
stifled Darrell Mudra’s fiesty
Seminoles.

“We were over-cautious at
Florida »State,” analyzed Long.
“This week we’re going to unwind

at Georgia Tech. As Coach Majors
says, ‘We're gonna shoot our
pistols from our hips.’ ”

But the state of Georgie leaves a
bitter taste in the 205 pound
sophmore’s mouth, which even
after a year hasn’t been washed
away. ’

Every day Long stares at a plain
white towel, the cloth he used to-
dry himself after last year’s
Georgia game. It has not been
used since; it serves as a
combination reminder and psycher.

“Those Georgians are thinking,
‘Here comes Long, he’s gonna
miss it.’ Well, they're gonna be
wrong.”

So there it is: as Carson pointed
out, it’s a three man team on ﬁeld
goals, the snap from center, the
holder and the kicker. If the ﬁrst
two are on target, Long will be too.
He says so.

Georgia Tech also brings some
fond memories to mind for Johrmy
Majors. When he was a star
halfback for Coach Bowden
Wyatt’s Tennessee'\ Vols in 1956,
they met the Ramblin’ Wreck in a
battle of undefeateds. Tennessee
was victorious, 6-0. Perhaps that

his customary ﬁrst inning run, this
time on a Joe Torre single, Rooker
settled down to shut out the Cards

". the rest of the way for his 13th
victory. Oliver's contribution was a
ringing 2 run double over the head
of Lou Brock in the seventh inning,
which broke the game open.

“I don’t like it, I don’t appreciate
it at all,” said Rooker of the first
inning run which has fast become
his trademark. “Things even out,_
you just can’t think negative
thoughts.”

‘to thrive on the close pressure

games, rising to the occasion even

when __his teamates don’t always
help him. _ _He concedes that
baseball is in his blood.

. “Ever since I was a little kid there

was nothing I ever wanted to do but

play baseball.” He plays it and he
plays it well, reaching his peak at
the age of 31 after wandering
aimlessly in the minors and the big
leagues. « ~ ’
“It took time for me to learn
things,” commented Rooker on his
minor league career. Originally an

 outfielder, he was switched to a

. pitcher and the transition took‘

quite a while. He received very

little help with his pitching in

Kansas City and only when he

reached Pittsburgh did the rug-

gedly handsome lefty get some sort
of personalized instw.€:ti(.m.
That instruction not only made

Rooker a better pitcher but also a

happy man. That happiness
exploded after Wednesday night’s

win as Roker threw the ball into the

stand. “I was happy and ‘whoever
got the ball would be happy.”

Another happy man is Al Oliver,
this season the Pirate’s most
consistent hitter. All season long,
whether it be hitting streaks or
driving in the needed runs, Oliver
has produced. Al feels it’s his job
because of his third position in the
Bucs' batting order.

“I feel basically that the third
hitter on the ball club is the key, he
has to keep the inning going and
avoid the double play.” He added,
“In the last three weeks I’ve hit the
ball real well with men on base.”
That point was proven against the
Cards.

The Bucs open a three game stand
with the Mets at home tonight
before - heading to St. Louis for
another showdown with the Red-
birds. With the season dwindling
to a few precious games it’s up to
players like Jim Rooker and Al
Oliver to continue their consistent
play if the Pirates a're’to make it to
the playoffs.

Perhaps Jim Rooker phrased it
best for players like Al Oliver and
himself. “I’ve given them a chance
and hopefully we can make the
most of it.”- Are you listening

Long himself is quite
