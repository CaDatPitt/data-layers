Star rusher Graham hopes to return from severe knee injury soon

Eric Burrage
‘“ Staﬁ’ W riter

On a chilly Wednesday night last
October, the entire Pitt football
community anxiously looked on
as starting running back Ray Gra-

ham suffered a knee injury and.

was carried off the ﬁeld in the
opening drive of a game against
Connecticut.

To the dismay of all Graham’s
coaches, teammates and support-
ers, the diagnosis of a torn ACL
meant it could be up to a year

 

   

Gmbzzm az gameétime decision for Saturday} opener  

before the star rusher, who was
leading the nation in yards at the
time, could return to the ﬁeld.
Now, nine months later, the
Pitt football team has ﬁnished

its training camp in preparation ,

for the new season, and Graham,
who is listed as a game—time deci-
sion to play in Saturday’s opener
against Youngstown State, has
joined his team back on the ﬁeld,
despite still being on the long
road to recovery.

“The knee is good,” Graham
said. “Physically, I am getting

 

there. I don’t feel quite myself yet,
but I’m feeling better each day in
practice and gaining conﬁdence
every time I go out there.”

Graham’s slow but continual ’

improvement characterizes much

of the rehabilitation process he -

has undergone since “having
surgery last November. He has
demonstrated a relatively speedy
recovery, but taking his time and
not rushing things were always

' his main focus.

“The rehab process was good?’
the senior tailback said. “The

 

 

main thing with trying to come
back was just that coach [Paul
Chryst] wanted to be smart about
it. We wanted to take things slow,
so we didn’t make any mistakes
and risk me getting hurt again.
Coach Chryst has helped me a lot
with things.”

Patience has naturally been an

- important theme in Graham’s re-

covery process, and Chryst, Pitt’s
newest head coach, has served as
a constant reminder of that.

“I think it is about gaining
confidence in what you can do

  Pitt'sp|‘°“df°°tb8“hi$t°TU (Pa9e10

and knowing what you can do.
So if he can just keep moving
forward, it will be very good,”
Chryst said.

Chryst also added that While
the coaching staff is excited for
Graham to return, they won’t rush
him back.

“The one thing we talked
about is I would rather play him
a day later than a day too soon,”
the first—year head coach said.
“We are a better team with him,

Despite failure, ticket sales

on par with previous years

Pat McAteer
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Although former Pitt football head
coach Todd Graham’s “high oc-
tane” offense tanked last season, it
appears season ticket sales for this
year continue to cruise right along.

E._]. Borghetti, Pitt’s senior asso-
ciate athletic director of media rela-
tions, said in an email that season
ticket sales haven’t dipped, despite
back-to-back underachieving sea-
sons.

“Regular-season tickets con-
tinue to sell at a good pace and at a
rate comparable to the two previ-
ous seasons,” Borghetti said, not-
ing that Pitt’s athletic department
doesn’t disclose numerical ﬁgures
for season ticket sales.

After generating a great deal
of enthusiasm among Pitt fans be-
fore the beginning of last season,
Graham struggled to adapt his no-
huddle offense to a Pitt roster'com-
prised of players ﬁt for former Pitt
head football coach Dave Wannst-
edt’s offense, resulting in a disap-
pointing six-win-and-seven—loss
season.

In January, Graham left Pitt for
Arizona State University citing fam-
ily concerns, becoming the third
coach to leave Pitt in two years. Ad-
ditionally, this year’s football sched-
ule includes home games against
Youngstown State University and
Gardner-Webb University — botl1
of whom play at the NCAA Division
1 Football Championship Subdivi-
sion level, a classiﬁcation for small-
er colleges.

But the hiring of former Wis-
consin offensive coordinator Paul
Chryst appears to have re-ener-
gized Pitt’s downtrodden fan base.

Students who purchase a season
ticket package receive a voucher
entitling them to one free T-shirt at
Pitt Stop, a seller of Pitt merchan-
dise at the comer of Forbes Avenue

and Bigelow Boulevard. The store’s

.owner, Chas Bonasorte, said he’s

witnessed unprecedented success
with the Panther Pitt promotion
this year.

“We’l'€ giving away 11,000 free
shirts here on the comer in con-
junction with the athletic depart-
ment, with the free season tickets,
and last year, two days before the
game, we’ll have doubled giving
out the [T-shirts],” Bonasorte said.
“We’ve given out ﬁve- or six—thou-
sand shirts already.”

Bonasorte also said the involve-
ment of Pitt’s Student Government
Board’s Traditions Committee in re-
launching the Panther Pitt student
section has helped generate enthu-
siasm among members of Pitt’s stu-
dent body. ' I

The Panther Pitt is a revival of
a student football fan group that
existed between 2002 and 2006.
The group has begun a social media
campaign in hopes of generating
school spirit and increasing atten-
dance among students at the Satur-
day football games.

With Pitt’s ﬁrst game‘ against
Youngstown State only a day away,
students have appeared to put the
football team’s previous two sea-
sons behind them, and are looking
forward to a new start under Chryst.

Junior Andrew Banks said he
purchased season tickets this year
and cares about the team’s success
“to an extent,” but that he doesn’t
want to have a repeat performance
of last season.

For some students, the game
day experience at Heinz Field,
Pitt’s home stadium, outweighs the
team’s on-ﬁeld performance. Junior
Milsha Reid said she viewed the
games as an entertaining activity on
the weekends.

“I just go because everyone’s
there, and I really like the band.
And it’s just like a social event,” Reid
said. I

nomination for president in Tampa

Republican Presidential nominee
Mitt Romney delivered an impas-
sioned speech on personal free-
doms in the United States at the
Republican National Convention
in Tampa, Fla., Thursday, con-
trasting these founding principles
with the governing philosophy of
President Barack Obama.

As he accepted the Republican
presidential nominee bid in front
of a lively crowd, Romney blasted
Obama for campaigning on sym-
bols of unity during his 2008 pres-
idential campaign but then divid-
ing the electorate as president.

“I wish President Obama had
succeeded, because I want Amer-
ica to succeed. But his promises
gave way to disappointment and
division,” Romney said. “This isn’t
something we have to accep .”

Romney used the event as an

opportunity to bridge the person-

 

A al disconnect between himselfand

middle-class voters by citing his
experience as a husband and fa-
ther of ﬁve children. Preceding his
speech was a video chronicling his
life and business experience.

But Romney’s message of unity
was lost on some voters in the
Pittsburgh area.

Before Romney’s address,
which began at 10 p.m., One
Pittsburgh, an issue—based activ-
ist group, held a counter-rally in
Schenley Plaza. Eric Sharmon, the
group’s press representative, said
One Pittsburgh opposed Romney’s
economic philosophy of cutting
taxes on wealthy Americans as a
method of creating jobs.

“His plan is to cut taxes for
the rich under the idea that that’s
going to create more jobs; if the
rich have more money, they’re go-
ing to have that money to create
jobs,” Shannon said. “We’ve seen
that before — that’s trickle-down
economics — and it really hasn’t

worked before.”

Pitt College Republicans Presi-
dent Casey Rankin, whose orga-
nization endorsed Romney dur-
ing the primaries — the ﬁrst time
the group has endorsed a primary
candidate ——- thought that Rom-_
ney’s appearance at the Republi-
can National Convention provided
him an opportunity to redeﬁne
himself to the electorate.

“Romney’s primary goal during
the convention is to deﬁne him-
self and his positions on his own
terms,” Rankin said in an email.

But Pitt College Democrats
President Lara Sullivan said a
Romney presidency would negate
gains made by the middle class un-
der Obama. V

“Romney and Ryan’s plan for
our nation’s future would simply
take us back — back to a place in
which the wealthiest Americans
prosper and the middle class suf-
fers,” Sullivan said. “The choices
are very clear in this election.” I

Message to Oakland bicyclists: you are

not immune to trafﬁc laws

Claire Eckroate
For The Pitt News

I’ve seen some odd things in Oak-
land, but last Wednesday was the
first time I saw a bicycle with a
pool noodle attached to it. When
I read the accompanying sign —
“This Is What 4 Feet Looks Like”

‘ — I understood.

The noodle atjthe back of the
bike was there to illustrate a rule
that every driver needs to under-
stand: the distance between a car
and a bicycle should remain at a
minimum of four feet. Sadly, this
public service announcement was
made in response to the bicycle
tragedies that occurred earlier this
summer.

According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, the two accidents in-
volving motorists interfering with
bicyclists occurred on Penn Av-
enue during the same week. Natu-
rally, these accidents_ raised nu-
merous concerns about bike safety
in a city that is working to become
more cyclist-friendly. The city is
working with Bike Pittsburgh and
PennDOT to remove some bikes
from the busiest streets and pre-
vent reckless driving by motorists.

' But as with any conﬂict, there
must be room for concessions on
both sides. Bike advocates might
bemoan the overall lack of bike
lanes in the city, but drivers are just
as correct to point out the speed of
and sometimes reckless passing
by bikers on some of the busiest
trafﬁc arteries in Pittsburgh. T

Sorry, cyclists. I have to side
with those irritated drivers. You
make me cringe. My quick list of
grievances:

You are not a pedestrian.

Bikes do not belong on the
sidewalk, regardless of what you
might think. The sidewalk is for
those of us who are walking. This
should theoretically force cyclists
onto the street, where they are to
obey traffic laws. The sidewalk is
too narrow for both walkers and
bikers. The ruling? Act as cars do.
This is the law.

This is often ignored: At four-
way crosswalks — like the one on
Forbes Avenue and Craig Street

-— bikers are often seen crossing

vertically, horizontally, diagonally,
upside-down and backwards ——
any which way they please. This is
very unlike a car’s behavior. I don’t
know what to expect. You are too
unpredictable.

You make one—way streets haz-
ardous. T

Students are more than fa-
miliar with the mess of one-way
streets in I South Oakland. The
setup is conﬁising for cars and
awkward for walkers. But once
new residents get it, they still have
to look both ways. It’s not unlikely
a bike is coming down the wrong
way. Again, this is very unlike a
car’s behavior.

You somehow manage to take
up the entire road.

Just to make me even more ner-
vous as I  not to hit anyone’s side
mirror amid the parallel—parking
zoos of Oakland, Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill, cyclists insist on
riding side by side in a horizontal '
line, taking up the entire width of
the lane.

This isn’t . the “Do-Re-Mi”
scene from “The Sound of Music.”
This is a major road. When people

on bikes weighing in at a mere few
pounds are taking up more space
than my 2oo0—plus pound Honda
Civic, something has to change.
There are those signs that say
“Share The Road” picturing a car
and a bicycle. Sharing is a two-way
street (unlike those described in
grievance No. 2.

So to the bikers: What has giv-
en you this traffic immunity? You
ﬂoat in limbo between pedestrian
and vehicle. As a pedestrian, I’m
pushed aside as you ﬂy past me.
As a driver, I am slowed by your
pedaling eco-friendly health-con-
scious nature, worrying that the
bike’s brakes may fail, causing you
to tumble in the direction of my
car. I am frustrated.

Grievances aside, you do de-
serve a bit of credit. We know that
bicycles provide an economically
friendly alternative to driving a
car for many individuals, especial-
ly those who live in Oakland and
its surrounding neighborhoods.
It’s a great way to stayhealthy as
well, considering that standing
shoulder-to-shoulder on a packed
71A isn’t burning any calories and
is inducing claustrophobia.

At the end of the day, both cy-
clists and drivers alike should fol-
low the rules of the road, whether
by maintaining a safe distance or
going the “righ ” way down the
one-way street. But if you’re go-
ing to make your own rules, the
least you could do while you bike
pastme on the sidewalk is warn
me with a simple “passing on your
left.”

Panther Pitt hopes to  student section at Heinz Field
Assggigigzzritlssggitor related colored shirts (neon green

When the Pitt football team takes
the ﬁeld for the season opener
against Youngstown State on Sat-
urday, a sea of navy—blue—clad fans
will greet it by the north end zone
of Heinz Field.

That mass of navy will be known
as the “Panther Pitt” — the rein-
vented football student section.

An effort of the Student Govern-
ment Board’s Traditions Commit-

tee, the group’s aim is to improve
the football game-day experience.

And according to senior Mike
Osterrieder, who helped organize
the new student section, right now
is an ideal time to tackle such a task.

“This is the perfect time to do
this, because there is excitement
surrounding football now, immedi-
ately because of [new head coach]
Paul Chryst, and then next year we
make the move to the ACC,” he said.
“After that, our schedules are going
to be better, bowl games are going
to be better, game times are going
to be better.

“Overall, within these next
couple years, I think the football
experience is really going to im-
prove substantially from where
it is now and where it has been,”
Osterrieder said.

Student excitement doesn’t ap-
pear to have taken any signiﬁcant
hits after the debacle of last year.
While senior Kahill Liddell says
he’s disappointed that he won’t be
around to see Pitt take on the ACC,
he’s nonetheless hopeful about
Pitt’s football team this season,
especially given its opportunity “to
go out with a bang in the Big East.”

“A new year is a new year. I
will always have faith in the Pitts-
burgh teams,” Liddell said. “I love
my school, and because I love my
school, it’s innate for me to love
my team.”

Since its formation last year,
the committee has moved quickly,
designing a T-shirt that students
will receive when they buy football
season tickets.

Panther Pitt organizers hope
the shirts will add uniformity to the
section, similar to the intense cohe-
sion visible in the Oakland Zoo —
the basketball student section. This

is to combat a lack of uniformity at
football games in recent years, as
evidenced by the wide array of un-

v~--~ ..~—«- on »» .—». ~..,—.-.. .. —un..r

and pink, among others) frequentl
seen in the section. -

Improved transportation from
campus to Heinz Field and back has
been another goal of Panther Pitt
organizers, and additional pickup
and drop—off points, signage and
buses are planned for this fall.

“It will be easier to get to and
from games,” Osterrieder said.

The idea of an organized, uni-
ﬁed student section at Pitt football
games is not a new one. The Pan-
ther Pitt was ﬁrst created in 2003
by alumnae Robin Frank andjulie
Brennan on the same basic prem-
ise as the current one: improving
the student experience at football
games.

Frank said that when she gradu-
ated law school at Pitt in 2007, the
enthusiasm had waned on former
head coach Dave Wannstedt after
his hiring had initially provided
such fervor and helped the group
to grow.

And soon after, the old Panther
Pitt organization ceased.

As for how this incarnation will
pan out, it’s too early to know for
sure.

‘fl can’t really speak on that. We

‘ht

Blue Panther Pitt T-shirts were given to every student who bought season tickets. ohad Cadji | For The Pitt News

can only wait and see,” Liddell said.

To Cam Saddler, an outspoken
senior receiver on the Pitt football
team, the enthusiasm needs to be
revived because of the important
role fans can play.

“Sometimes the games get long,
and just having a student section
that’s ready [and] loud, that can
give you a little extra oomph. That’s
why it’s called the 12th man,” Sad-
dler said. “Sometimes we need a

little help. Sometimes we’re going
through a rough patch. If we get a
big play and the crowd gets into
it, that can get us going a little bit
on offense.”

Perhaps the biggest challenge
the group will face is ﬁnding out
how to counter, if not solve, the
“Sweet Caroline” quandary: the
mass exodus of students beginning
after the popular song is played at
the end of the third quarter at each

home game.

With people leaving in droves,
it’s hard for the players not to see it.

“We notice it on the sidelines.
It’s not something we’re proud of,”
Saddler said.

Section organizers say there
will be more interactive activities
during the fourth quarter aimed

Inside Camp: Freshmen  ust

   
   

to the life‘ of college football

ball trainingcamp throughout August. Luv Purohit | Assistantvisual Editor

Throughout August, new head coach Paul

Chryst and the Pitt football players spent
each day at their facility onthe South Side,

partaking in a grueling training cainp to

prepare for the upcoming 2012 campaign.

The Pitt News is proud to present the ﬁnal

installment of a three-part series titled

“Inside Camp” to give you a close—up of
what life at training camp was like for the

2012 Panthers.

PART THREE: LOW MEN ON THE TOTEM
POLE

As long as senior kicker Kevin Harper
can help it, being the butt of jokes will re-
main a training camp rite of passage for
freshmen on the Pitt football team.

“It’s all good. We all got it when we were
freshmen, and I’m sure they’ll do it when
they’re upperc1assmen,” Harper said. “It’s
just good bonding time.”

As if going from high school athletics to
Division I college football wasn’t difficult
enough, the new players on Pitt’s football
team were often subjected to playful ridi-
cule at the hands of their more—experienced
teammates during training camp — a two-
week—long ordeal in early August that con-
sisted of at least one three—hour practice
every day.

One freshman who experienced the
good—natured ribbing from his new team-

mates ﬁrsthand was defensive backjahmahl
Pardner. A somewhat surprising breakout
performer throughout training camp, the
Rochester, N.Y., native didn’t play quite
well enough to avoid a common practice
on teams in all sports at all levels.

“I got a really.bad nickname already,”
said Pardner, who may vie for playing time
in the secondary as a true freshman. “They
call me ‘Roach.’ That’s my nickname, and
they tell me‘it’s because I look like the roach
from “Men in Black” —— that’s the joke.”

But Pardner knew his teammates were
just being goofy and took the joking in
stride, even the unfortunate alias that
sophomore linebacker Todd Thomas be-
stowed upon him.

“I don’t enjoy the name at all, but I can’t
really do anything about it,” Pardner said.
“I have to shake it with my play. I can’t
really say anything, I just have to take it,
and hopefully if I keep working hard and
get on the ﬁeld, I’ll be in a position to say,
‘Hey, I’m making plays now, you can’t call
me Roach anymore. My name’s ]ahmahl'.”’

The dreadlock—sporting Pardner knew
the leap from high school football to the
college level would be taxing, with the daily
grind of training camp representing the

‘ ﬁrst obstacle in the challenging transition.

“When I got here, it kind of hit me, and
the ﬁrst couple days I was a little over-
whelmed, and I wasn’t playing as well as I
could,” the soft~spoken Pardner said. “Then

For a team many selected to finish in the
middle of -the pack among Big East com-

~ petitors in this upcoming football sea-

son, the 2012 edition of the Pittsburgh
Panthers has the potential to rise up and
claim a conference championship.
Although the Panthers are talented,
the strength of schedule — or lack thereof
—— in the Panthers’ ﬁnal season as a Big
East member could play an aiding role _
in.Pitt’s hopes for competing in a bowl
slightly more notable than the BBVA Com-
pass Bowl. . ,
Here’s a rundown of Pitt’s football

"schedule for.this year, along with some

predictions for howl see theseason play-
ing out. V

Youngstown State

_ The Panthers start their campaign
this Saturday with a classic cupcake game
against the Penguins, Pitt’s lowly Football
Championship Subdivision opposition
from a small school in Ohio.

The biggest threat for Youngstown
State comes from running back Jamaine
Cook, who racked up 1,599 all-purpose
yards last season, but these Penguins
might need Sidney Crosby and Evgeni

Malkin to have a chance in this game.
Expect Pitt to take care of business eas-
ily, as the Panthers prepare for a week-two

showdown with conference rival Cincin- -

nati. -
Pitt beats the Penguins, 34-10.

Cincinnati

In a rare early season matchup with a
Big East conference opponent, the Pan-

thers have an early opportunity to jump .

on top of the conference standings with
a win against the Bearcats in the River
City Rivalry. k

This matchup should favor the Pan-
thers, with the Bearcats having lost quar-

terback Zach Collarosand running back

Isaiah Pead, last season’s Big East Offen-
sive Player of the Year. '
_The Cincinnati defense also lost a num-
ber of talented starters, namely defen-
sive tackle Derek Wolfe, who earned 2011
Big East co—Defensive Player of the Year.
In addition to the personnel losses and
questions surrounding the Bearcats, Pitt

' should also beneﬁt from having played

one game and Cincinnati’s beginning the
season with a bye.

Pitt wins this Thursday-night game in
front of a national audience, 24-14.

No. 16 Virginia Tech

The Hokies pose the largest challenge
to Pitt out of any team on the schedule.

Like Cincy, Virginia Tech also needs
to find replacements for key players on
offense, especially running back David
Wilson, the 2011 ACC Player of the Year.

But after tossing 30 touchdowns and
setting a single-season school record

' with 3,482 passing yards in his first sea-

son, quarterback Logan Thomas appears
primed to become one of college football’s
renowned signal callers.

The Hokies’ defense should be the best
the Panthers will face this season, which
could cause problems for Pitt quarterback
Tino Sunseri.

Virginia Tech shows Pitt what ACC foot-
ball is all about, 3o-‘10. .

Gardner-Webb

After playing the toughest team on
their schedule, the Panthers get a break
before diving into Big East play with a
game against arguably their easiest op-
ponent, FCS school Gardner—Webb.

The Runnin’ Bulldogs (yes, that is
their nickname) will return their leading
rusher from last season, Kenny Little, who
posted 1,107 yards on 200 carries. Even
that should not provide much trouble to
Pitt’s defense, which year-in and year-out
is always stout against opposing teams’

  Analyzing, predicting Pitt’ s entire football schedule for 20 12

rushing attacks.
Pitt cruises, 35-10.

Syracuse

In Pitt’s second conference matchup,
the Panthers will face a Syracuse team that
figures to boast one of the Big East’s best
passing attacks. Quarterback Ryan Nas-

sib returns after passing for 2,689 yards

and 22 touchdowns in his 2011 campaign.
Catching his passes will be a group of
experienced receivers led by Alec Lemon,
who snagged 68 balls for a total of 834
yards and 6 touchdowns last season.
Beyond the passing game, though,
there isn’t much to strike fear in the hearts
of the Orange’s opponents. The running
game is unproven, and there is no clear
starter, while the team that ranked last in
the Big East in total defense last season
will not be much improved.
Pitt pulls away in the end, 31-17.

No. 25 Louisville

In the Panthers’ game representing the
midway point of the 2012 season, they will
take on the Cardinals that many picked
this summer to win the conference crown
at the season’s conclusion.

Several incoming Panthers may see playing time as freshmen

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcyf Wrz'ter

Head coach Paul Chryst’s ﬁrst recruiting
class was a mix of players who were recruited
by Todd Graham and several players that
Chryst identiﬁed as needs for his team.

Now that they’re all in Pittsburgh, several
freshmen have stood out to Chryst as valu-
able enough to see the ﬁeld early in their
careers.

Chryst believes in redshirting a majority
of his freshmen, so expect to see plenty of
Panthers in that position this year. Former
coaches Dave Wannstedt and Graham both
frustrated fans by redshirting only a few
players. ,

While Chryst would like to ﬁll his entire
roster two—deep with upperclassmen, these
six players have proven valuable at training
camp, and will likely be inﬂuential on the
ﬁeld for the Panthers this season.

].P. Holtz, tight end

‘Holtz, once a Penn State commit, per-
formed well at camp and positioned himself
as the third tight end behind senior Hubie
Graham and sophomore Drew Carswell.

Chryst successfully coached several tight

ends at Wisconsin and likes to use three tight V

ends in some formations. Holtz, a graduate
of nearby Shaler High School, should see

signiﬁcant playing time in run situations,
replacing Carswell because of his superior
blocking skills. »

Don’t be surprised if the 6-foot—4,
245—pound freshman catches a few touch-
down passes this year.

Darryl Render, defensive tackle

Render has been getting the majority of
the second—team reps at defensive tackle in
training camp, working behind the talented
upperclassmen.

Although Render has very little chance
of breaking the starting lineup of the “War
Daddies,” a nickname members of the defen-
sive line have given themselves, he should
provide quality depth to a defensive line
needing just that. Render, who can learn a
lot from star junior defensive tackle Aaron
Donald, will give the starters a breather dur-
ing games and could get signiﬁcant playing
time if one of the interior linemen goes down
with an injury.

Bam Bradley, linebacker

Bradley has a problem similar to Ren-
der’s: the upperclassmen ahead of him are
extremely talented. In his case, there are
four safeties who all would be starters for a

New Pitt football head coach Paul Chryst
is understandably receiving much of the
attention of media and fans as the Panthers
prepare for the 2012 campaign.

But one man can’t run an entire football
program.

Meet the 2012 Pitt football coaching
staff assisting Chryst — the men working
behind the scenes to maximize the poten-
tial of the players they are responsible for,
sitting in the coaching boxes and patrolling
the ﬁeld on Saturdays.

Offensive assistant coaches

Brooks Bollinger, a former Wisconsin
Badgers quarterback and eight-year vet-
eran in the professional ranks, enters his
first year of coaching at the collegiate level
with a difﬁcult challenge: to improve the

ﬁcult 2011 season as the Pitt passer, during
which he threw more interceptions than
touchdowns and took more sacks than any
other quarterback in the country, Bollinger
believes his starting quarterback made
signiﬁcant strides during training camp.

“He’s progressing and doing a nice
job,” Bollinger said of Sunseri. “You’re
not seeing the same mistakes he made in
the spring.”

Bollinger played all four years at Wis-
consin from 1999 to 2003. As a redshirt
freshman, Bollinger led the Badgers to
a Rose Bowl victory and earned himself
the honor of Big Ten Rookie of the Year.
He ﬁnished his collegiate career with an
impressive 30-12 record and a 3-0 mark
in bowl games.

A 2003 NFL Draft pick of the New York

Jets, Bollinger spent time with New York,
Minnesota and Dallas before playing two
seasons in the United Football League.

denying that the program has struggled to
regain its status as a national powerhouse
since the early 1980s.

The last time Pitt genuinely contended
for a national championship was in 1981,
when the then-No. 1 Panthers, led by three
future NFL Hall of Famers — Dan Marino,
Russ Grimm and Rickey Jackson — lost
the ﬁnal game of the regular season to
rival Penn State, which eliminated the
"Panthers from title contention.

the team’s South Side facility. ,
Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson stated
that the main attribute the football head coach
search committee looked for was leadership.
“We believed it was important to ﬁnd a
leaderwho gets the very best from his players
while also developing the kind of culture that

’ “ ﬁts the University of Pittsburgh,” Pederson

said. “Paul Chryst is that leader.”

Chryst, 46, grew up watching his father
coach high school football in his hometown
of Madison, Wis., but he moved to nearby
Platteville, Wis., after his dad took over the
University of Wisconsin—Plattevil1e football
program.

After starring at Platteville High School,
Chryst decided to return to his hometown to
play quarterback for the Wisconsin Badgers.
He lettered three times at Wisconsin before
graduating in 1988 with a degree in political

' ‘“ science.

Aspiring to follow in his now—late father’s
footsteps by beginning a football coaching
career, Chryst enrolled at West Virginia and
became a graduate assistant for the Moun-
taineers’ football team.

For much of the next decade, Chryst built
his resume by working as an offensive assis-
tant with Canadian Football League teams and
small colleges. In 1997, he ﬁnally earned his
ﬁrst major collegiate coachingjob as offensive
coordinator at Oregon State.

In 1999, Chryst delved into the National

“I’ve had a lot of great mentors,” Chryst
said of the numerous coaches he’s worked for.
“I’ve been fortunate.”

Although he has coached in alot of places,

followed before Chryst accepted the Badgers’

Chryst wants Pitt fans to know they don’t have
to worry — he doesn’t have family scattered
across the country and other dream jobs like
the departed Graham claimed to have.

“This is a destination job to me,” Chryst
said. “If you can’t live in the moment, then
you’re cheating yourself, and you’re cheating
your players.”

“This is a pretty good gig,” he added.

' During their ﬁrst training camp under
the new regime, some of Chryst’s players ex-
pressed their supportfor the new head coach.

Star senior running back Ray Graham
believes the team’s new offensive attack will
excite Pitt fans who haven’t had much to cheer
for in recent years.

“With [Chryst] being an offensive guy, he
likes to see excitement and offense,” Graham
said. V

Offensive lineman Chrisjacobson, a sixth-
year seniorwho has been at Pitt through all of
the recent coaching changes, said that despite
everythingthe team has gone through the past
few years, the current Panthers have had no
problem believing in Chryst and his coach-
ing staff.

“Coach Chryst comes out here, and he
works us,”Jacobson said after a practice. “Ev-
eryone is buying into what Coach is saying.”

Chryst explained that getting his players
to rally around him begins with showing each
and every one of them just how much he cares
about their football careers, their schoolwork
and their lives.

“Players don’t care how much you know
until they see how much you care,” he said. ﬂ

but I want to make sure we are doing what’s
right for him.” _

Despite all of his improvements, Gra—
ham has also had some difficulty and frus-
tration throughout his healing process.

“The biggest thing was [realizing] that
everybody heals differently,” Graham said.
“You have to go through a certain phase
where you ﬁgure out what works for you
and how your body has adjusted to being
injured and then work toward balancing
those things back out.”

Graham, who has worn a red no—contact
jersey for much of Pitt’s training camp,
says thatremaining positive and trying
to approach everything optimistically has
helped him to learn a lot since injuring
his knee.

“It’s all about your approach to things,”
he said. “I had to look at the injury as a
positive and see how I can use it to grow
as a runner and how it can make me more
versatile. There is more than one way to
be a good running back, and I think this
injury helped me to realize that.”

On the ﬁeld, Graham not only feels
smarter, but more versatile as well. For a
rusher with his slick, quick-cut style of run-
ning, a major knee injury can be devastat-
ing. But Graham has used the opportunity
to develop other aspects of his game, such
as his strength, knowledge and leader-
ship abilities, in hopes of making him even

l3

tougher to defend than before.

“I just started trying to get better at all
aspects of the game and focused on being
smart while I was running,” he said. “A?
ﬁrst, that meant less sharp cuts and lateral
movement, so I was forcing myself to get
better in other ways, but I know I can get
back to being the old Ray once my con~
ﬁdence gets back to being 100 percent.”

Being on the sidelines has also helpec,L_
Graham become a better mentor. Freshman
running back Rushel Shell, who is arguably
the most talented member of Pitt’s fresh-
man class, says he has already picked up
a lot of lessons from Graham.

“You can learn a lot out of the running
back spot from guys like Ray,” Shell said.
“He and [sophomore running back] Isaac
Bennett were telling me little things in
practice that can separate the good from
the great.”

Though it is not over yet, Graham’s .
healing process seems like it has been as.
successful as possible up until this point.
Graham is excited about continuing to get
better and eventually taking the ﬁeld when
the season starts-

He says the Panthers are gaining more
and more confidence each day as they get
ready to begin the season, and the run-
ning back has set a goal to return to the
startingglineup for opening day against
Youngstown State. v

“We want to put on a show for the fans
and give them a good season to look for-
ward to,” he said. I we

cally gifted offense in the conference.

On defense, the Cardinals will return
a number of players from the unit that
ranked 10th in rushing yards allowed last
season. This poses a huge problem for Pitt
because, in the event Ray Graham and the
running game cannot get going, the onus
falls on the shoulders of Sunseri. When Pitt
needs to rely on the pass this season, good
things will not usually happen.

Louisville wins this crucial game, 27-13.

Buffalo

In a rare nonconference matchup in the
middle of the season for Pitt, the Panthers
travel to the home of the Bulls. Fortu-
nately, the game gives Pitt a chance to
recover somewhat after what will likely
be a tough, hard—fought contest against
Louisville. ’

The only true bright spot for the Bulls
is tailback Branden Oliver, who set a
school record with 1,395 rushing yards
last season. Beyond that, fans should not
expect Buffalo to offer up much resistance
against Pitt.

Pitt takes care of business, 31-10.

Temple

In their first year of Big East competi-
tion, the Temple Owls come to Heinz Field
to take on the Panthers in their ﬁnal year
of Big East play. This season, led by quar-
terback Chris Coyer, the Owls will look to
ﬁnd success against BCS competition after
a seven-year hiatus from the conference.

With Coyer posing a dual—threat as
the signal caller in Coach Steve Addazio’s
spread option, the Owls also have depth
at the running back position with Matt
Brown, who rushed for 916 yards as the
second option out of the backﬁeld, Kenny
Harper and Boston College transfer Mon-

. tel Harris.

Defensively, the Owls lose a lot of
contributors from the previous season’s
squad, and should not give the Pitt offense
too much trouble during the game.

This could be close, but Pitt wins, 28-
13.

Notre Dame

Keeping with the tradition of the past
few years, Pitt will play Notre Dame late
in the season, and heading to South Bend,
Ind., will posea challenge for the Pan-
thers.

Offensively, Tommy Rees will man the
helm in the early going, but the team’s
receiving corps lacks depth after the de-
parture of Michael Floyd. After Rees threw
14 interceptions last season, the Fighting

Irish need to ﬁeld reliable targets for Rees.
The defense will be the strength of this
year’s squad, as many key contributors
from last year’s unit will return.
Don’t expect many points in the game,
but Notre Dame will score more, 20-14.

Connecticut

After ﬁnishing last in the Big East in
total offense last season, little should
convince Pitt fans the Huskies will give
the Panthers too much difﬁculty. Leading
the offense is tailback Lyle McCombs, a
freshman All—American choice last sea-
son after putting up 1,151 yards and seven
touchdowns.

But his numbers will decrease if the
passing game does not improve, which
is the biggest concern for the Huskies
this year. . -

Pitt comes ‘away victorious from this
mid-week matchup, 23-14.

Rutgers

Another team that will contend for the
Big East crown, Rutgers may be an ob-
stacle in Pitt’s way toward staking its own
claim to said crown. Rutgers has arguably
the deepest wide receiver corps in the
conference, with Brandon Coleman, Mark
Harrison and Quron Pratt leading the way.

Defensively, the Scarlet Knights will be
possibly the conference’s best teamiin that
respect. They return Khaseem Greene and
the league’s leading pass defense, which
will make games very tough on opposing
offenses.

The Scarlet Knights have a new head
coach, but they always seem to have Pitt’s
number. ‘ 4 -

Rutgers wins, 24-17.

South Florida

Pitt concludes its season on the road in
a matchup that could very well decide the
conference’s champion. Regarded by some
as the biggest threat to the conference fa-
vorite, Louisville, dual—threat quarterback
B._]. Daniels will lead the Bulls.

USF also boasts a strong receiving
corps, led by Sterling Griffin, Florida
transfer Chris Dunkley and Andre Davis.

On defense, the Bulls have experience

"at the safety and linebacker positions,

but they will need to ﬁnd answers for the
line. Although the questions are not as
pressing, USF will require some young
linemento step up and make the defense
even more formidable. This game could

i be won in the trenches.

Pitt ﬁnishes the regular season on a los-

. ing note by falling to South Florida, 31-14.

With that defeat, I expect the Panthers
to ﬁnish the season with a respectable 7-5
record (4-3 Big East). ‘

That won’t be enough to win the con-
ference for Pitt, but Pitt fansshould be
pleased if Chryst can lead the team to a
winning record and perhaps the Pinstripe
Bowl in New York in his ﬁrst season in
charge. ﬁ

Jim Hueber.

egg A 38—year coaching veteran at both the
collegiate and professional levels, Hueber
is coming to Pitt with knowledge of how to
demand the most from his players.

“If you talk to those guys coming off
the ﬁeld, I’m the most hated man,” Hueber
said following a training camp practice.

""‘They’re so sick of me [at training camp]
— it’s ridiculous.”

After playing football at and graduat-
ing from the University of South Dakota,
Hueber began his coaching career as an
offensive line specialist. His career in-

cludes a seven-year stint at Minnesota and
13 years at Wisconsin, where he crossed
paths with Chryst.

Pitt’s offensive line appears thin enter-
ing this season, so Hueber hopes to get the
most out of his available players. -

Also helping out on the offense is run-
ning backs coach Desmond Robinson, a
former Pitt standout defensive end and

linebacker from 1974 to 1978, and wide 

receivers coach Bobby Engram, a three-
time All-American at Penn State. Robinson
played on Pitt’s last national championship
team in 1976, while Engram’s records for
receiving yards and receiving touchdowns
still stand at Penn State.

Joe Rudolph, a Pennsylvania native and

Big Ten coaching veteran, will serve as the
Panthers’ offensive coordinator and tight
ends coach. Rudolph has spent the last
three years coaching at Wisconsin along-
side Chryst.

Defensive assistant coaches

Like many of his offensive counterparts,
new defensive coordinator Dave Huxtable

brings decades’ worth of experience to a '

defense already boasting plenty of veteran
players.

Huxtable’s coaching career began in
1982_ and recently included a seven-year
stint at Central Florida, where his defense
helped produce the best season in UCF his-

tory. He also spent last year at Wisconsin as
a linebackers coach before coming to Pitt.

The defensive line holds perhaps the
most promise of any area on this year’s
team, thanks mostly to star junior tackle
Aaron Donald. Donald and his linemates
are coached by Inoke Breckterﬁeld, a two-
time A1l—Pac—12 defensive end at Oregon
State.

Breckterfield stated that his most
promising defensive lineman is setting
a ﬁne example for Pitt’s younger players.

“His biggest [goal] is to be a ﬁnisher —
to ﬁnish plays — and to set that standard
for the younger guys,” Breckterﬁeld said.

Joining Huxtable and Breckterﬁeld on

sick; of me

coach Jim Hueber

defense are linebackers coach Chris Haer—
ing and secondary coach Matt House.

Haering’s name might ring a bell around
the Pittsburgh area. He coached the Mt.
Lebanon High School football team the
past 17 seasons, garnering 13 playoff ap-
pearances and the 2000 WPIAL Class
AAAA championship. This is his ﬁrst year
coaching at the collegiate level.

House spent the last four seasons in
the NFL assisting the defensive teams in
St. Louis and Carolina. He graduated and
began coaching at Michigan State in 2000.

The faces of the Pitt coaching staff
might be unfamiliar, but with the numer-
ous veteran coaches helping Chryst dur-
ing his first campaign at the helm of Pitt
football, experience and leadership will
be plentiful on the Panthers’ sidelines this
season. I

one day, I just sat down and told myself I
worked hard to get here, and just because
it’s tough right now, I can’t let that over-
whelm me. I just have to ﬁght through it.”
Sophomore running back Isaac Bennett
can remember what it was like when he
made the jump from high school to col-
legiate athletics a year ago and could. un-
doubtedly empathize with his freshman
teammate. ‘
“It just seems like yesterday we were
moving in,” Bennett said. “I see the fresh-
men unpacking, and they’ve got the carts
and everything. I think last year I didn’t
even get to unpack until the second week.”
Though the constant pressure to per—
form at training camp was still an ongoing
battle for Pardner, he kept in close contact
with his family, calling his parents each
day when he had some precious free time.
Pardner also said his roommate and
fellow underclassman Devon Porchia, a
linebacker who was in a similar situation,
could relate to what it’s like trying to ﬁght
for any playing time that. might be avail-
able.

“That’s why he’s one of my better“

friends,” Pardner said, “because we’re in
the same position, and he can just tell me,
like, ‘Remember what you’ve worked for
and why you’re here.”’

Spending nights together during camp
in their room in Sutherland Hall, Pardner
and Porchia liked to watch an occasional
episode of the comedic cartoon “Family
Guy” before bed or, if it was on, “The Shaw-
shank Redemption” -— one of Pardner’s
favorite movies.

And when the weekend came during
camp, it not only offered the players a bit of
a break with just an intra—squad scrimmage
on Saturdays and one practice on Sundays,
but also a chance to eat something other
than cafeteria food. In Pardner’s case, that
usually meant a trip to Oakland restaurant
Joe Mama’s for pasta or another one of his
favorite Italian dishes.

Soon enough, Porchia, Pardner and the
other freshmen will be seniors enduring
the ﬁnal training camp of their college ca-
reers, like Harper and wide receiver Cam
Saddler just did.

“My life was consumed by football these
two weeks, but it’s fun. I feel like that’s the
reason for the camp,” Saddler said. “You
get to block everything out, and it’s just
football.”

Just football, as in no gallivanting
around Oakland and enjoying the night-
life on thevweekends for him and his of-age
teammates?

“Man, that would be nice,” the senior
receiver said. “But, no, we don’t have the
time, and even when you do have the time,
you just want to lay in bed because you’re
worn out from all the practicing.

“It’s like a 16-hour work day. You go to
sleep, you wake up and you do it all over
again,” he said. ﬂ

at rewarding those who stay for the entire
game, such as text-to-win competitions with
potential prizes, including use of a luxury
box for a game.

The ﬁrst major football—related on—cam-
pus event scheduled by the new group was
the bonﬁre and picnic with Chryst and the
team on the Cathedral of Learning lawn on
Thursday. ’

The group has ‘also announced that there
will be ﬁreworks after the season opener
against Youngstown State on Sept. 1, and the
following Thursday game at Cincinnati willbe
screened on the Petersen Events Center lawn.

These events are put on with the assistance
of Pitt’s Athletic Department, but the section
is a student-reared endeavor, according to].D.
Schroeder, vice president of the Oakland Zoo
and member oﬂthe Traditions Committee.

The group’s social media presence on
Facebook and Twitter provides an avenue
to get information to a large number of people

quickly and maintain interest in the team

between games.

At last check, the Panther Pitt group al-
ready had more than 2,000 followers on
Twitter. V

While the Panther Pitt hopes to replicate
the Oakland Zoo’s success, it wants to do so
in its own way.

“We don’t want the Panther Pitt to be a
carbon copy of the Oakland Zoo for football.
It doesn’t work,” Osterrieder said. “The sports
are different, the rules are different [and] the
sizes of the student sections are completely
different.”

That said, both student organizations have
the same aims.

“Ultimately, our end goal is the same [as
the Zoo’s] — to get loyal, unwavering support,

- intense game days and a fun atmosphere,”

Osterrieder said‘. i
If anything, the amount of success the Zoo
has enjoyed shows that the Panther Pitt ha
the potential to work. . v
“That’s proof right there that the Pitt stu-

dent body as a whole is loyal, supportive and T
, cares about athletics,” Osterrieder said. “They

just need something to rally around, and for
