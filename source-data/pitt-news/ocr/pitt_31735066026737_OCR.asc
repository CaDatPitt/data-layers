For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Generations Together program brings the young and the
old together for mutually beneficial relationships.
“The goal is to promote leadership and community and per-

I sonal development. A lot of the time Pitt students aren’t from

the Pittsburgh neighborhoods. and this connects them,” said
Terry Laterza, an assistant program coordinator.

“Not only do the elders serve the youths, but the youths serve
the elders,” Laterza said.

Generations Together started with Sally Newman, the current

executive director, who said she maintained a good relationship '

with her grandmother and noticed other children didn’t always
have strong relationships.

“She initiated the program by bringing kids and adults togeth-
er to work,” said Laterza. '

Today, it offers many programs that cater to youth and the
elderly. 1

WASHINGTON — The
National Cable Television
Association is addressing
societal violence during a
campaign which involves all
of the major cable networks
starting this week.

Over the last several years,
the cable industry has been
criticized for the violent con-

has been pressured to do
something about it.

The association hopes the
week-long look at violence in
society willspur a national
debate that could lead to solu-
tions. ,

will air a nightly special
aimed at providing viewers

WASHINGTON —
Republicans are gearing up
for a tough fight when their
welfare reform bill reaches the
U.S. House of
Representatives.

Many Democrats oppose the
measure because they feel it
punishes the children and peo-

nothing to help people
become wage" earners.

The bill gives the bulk of
responsibility for welfare to
the states and was recently
amended to include an
increase in child care funding
by $750 million, which would
help welfaremothers to get
child care so that they can go
to work.

The House is also expected

to pass a measure which.

would revoke the driver’s and

Professor's dedication to slu

By Jennifer Aranoff
For The Pitt News

There are few seats left in the
crowded lecture room as
Professor Trevor Melia enters
and’ begins speaking.

In the following 50 minutes,
he speaks without notes for the
class, Rhetorical Process, using
modern and humorous exam-
ples to relate concepts to rough-
ly 150 students.

Melia manages to reach stu-
dents because of his dedication.

“If you’re going to be a
decent teacher you have to
know where [the students] are,”
he said. “Youhave to know
what sort of music they’_re lis-
tening to, what sort of sports
they’re admiring, to connect
with them. And that doesn’t
come naturally.” ,

The numbers in the class
seem to prove this. When Melia
put the course together and later
published a book to go along
with it, the class size was
between 300 and 500 students,
though he later cut it to 150.

Melia said he would like to I

teach an even smaller course,
though he sees nothing wrong
with large classes.

“Lots of things don’t happen
in a large course  but it also is
a part of life. [Students] are
going to emerge from the uni-
versity into a large world, some
of the aspects of which are very
large institutions  large cours-
es mirror what society is.”

Melia graduated from Pitt and
taught at the University of
Pittsburgh at Johnstown, Tufts
University and Northwestern
University before his professors
at Pitt asked him to return.
Melia put the course together
after his return to the university.

Rhetorical Process was the
product of the administration’s
request to work on new courses,
according to Melia.

“[Professors] were challenged
to develop general courses, not
intended for people who would
become rhetoricians for all their
life  but courses which would
speak to students.”

He’s had speaking engagements
in several different countries, as
well as traveling around the
United States every few sum-
mers for enjoyment.

I’ve done it on a motorcycle,
I’ve done it thumbing and just

he jokingly calls the “scholar

“I won a scholarship in

Though Melia said he was

quite content with Johnstown,
he did raise funds and helped
plan the expansion of the cam-
pus. In addition to teaching
there, he was assistant to the
president of the college and also
ran the television and radio pro-
gram at Johnstown.
_ In the 25 years Melia has
taught at Pitt, he said he has
seen numerous changes in the
attitudes of students.

“Twenty years ago when I
used to teach [Rhetorical

Process] in David Lawrence

Hall, I remember walking into i

that hall back in the ‘70s  and
there would be an acrid smoke
ﬂoating in. And this was kids

good deal brighter and more

Melia just finished co—editing

a book called “Science. Reason '

and Rhetoric" which he said
will probably be used in gradu-
ate courses. He has also co—edit-
ed a book on Kenneth Burke.
on whom Melia has lectured in
other countries. ,

Melia said he doesn’t see
himself teaching any other
courses in the near future since
Rhetorical Process continues to
draw students. ‘

“The course has been suc-
cessful in terms of numbers.
Students have continued to like
it. which is rather strange to me
because it was designed for a
different time. different place.

.elderly together. Calling All Students To

Learning Exchange involves the elderly visiting
secondary schools to tutor students. The
Yearbook. currently underway, is an intergenera-
tional theater group that performs throughout the
Pittsburgh school district. Mentors and Service to
Youth consists of older adults at the university
level visiting the engineering department.

Bob Faux, a graduate student researcher for
Generations Together, is involved in the program
for the School of Engineering. He said retired
engineers from Westinghouse work with the
first- and second-year students concerning prac-
tical engineering problems.

“Students get a lot out of it,” said Faux. “One
of the retired engineers designed a project for
students to work on. They were actually able to
see the real project. It was very insightful.”

The Youth and Service to Elders program is
the most popular at Generations Together and IS
celebrating its 15th anniversary. Laterza said the
program relieves isolation of the elderly and
reduces fear.

Erin Coffield has been a member of Youth and
Service to Elders since the fall of 1993. Her
social work major requires completion of a cer-
tain number of hours of volunteering. After she
finished her requirement, she said she continued
to volunteer because she loved it.

“I adore the friend I’ve adopted. We’ve
become missing links, and we look out for each
other for moral support,” said Coffield.

Coffield said Anne, her elderly friend, possess-
es values and morals that aren’t present anymore.

“She has lived through the Depression, so she
is like a walking history book,” said Coffield.

Coffield said she reads Anne’s mail to her,
pays her bills and takes her to doctor appoint-
ments.

“Society needs to work with connecting the
younger spectrum to the older spectrum to elimi-
nate barriers. This program allows one to see
positive,” said Coffield. “The emotional reward
that you receive from an elderly friend — you
just can’t put a price on it.”

Family Friends is a nation-
wide program started in 1986.
Its original mission was to
match well-able, active volun-
teers with a chronically ill or
disabled child.

This year, the University of
Pittsburgh was awarded a
grant by the Administration on

Aging in the U.S. Department -

of Health and Human Services
to start a Family Friends pro-
ject at Pitt,. but to limit it
strictly for diabetic children,
making it the first of its kind.

“We sent out news
announcement through OASIS
(Older Adult and Information
Systems) to recruit the elderly
volunteers, and the response
has been very good,” project
coordinator Ruth Drescher
said. “We have eight volun-
teers and hope to have 20 by
October of 1995.”

The children are chosen

_ from the Children’s Hospital

diabetic center.

According to Shari Boyle,
who works in the Department
of Clinical Social Work at
Children’s Hospital, “I think
the children will respond posi-
tively to the program. It will
provide them with extra sup-
port, and they look forward to
meeting with their elderly
friends.”

Marge Stelzer and Dorothy
Shore, two of the elderly vol-
unteers in the project, said vol-
unteering is the name of the
game.

“I never complain about
anything because I find no
time,” said Shore. Other vol-
unteers said they think of these
children and families as their
friends and they want to pitch
in and help.

Stelzer, Shore and the rest of
the volunteers meet weekly to
educate themselves about the

disease and to become trained

in helping the children. The
group also designs activities
for the children.

During the conversations,
Dr. Dorothy Becker from
Children’s Hospital enters the
room to teach them about dia-
betes and its effects. She said
when a diabetic’s insulin is
low, the effects are loss of
weight, increased urination
and increased appetite and
thirst.

After the meeting, some vol-
unteers display a look of fright

on their faces. They think

they’re not sufficiently quali-
fied to help the children.
Others look comfortable and
pleased with the training ses-
sion.

“I’ve been volunteering
since I was a child. l’m lend-
ing a helping hand, and that’s
all that counts.” said one vol-
unteer.

An endowment is a gift
given in which the donor
specifies how the money is
to be used. The gift itself is
never spent. but only the
interest or revenue it gener-
ates — rendering it a gift
that keeps on giving. That’s
why endowments have mini-
mums to ensure that the
amount given can generate
enough money to support
that specific chair or founda-
tion. The amount set must be
able to cover raises in salary
and costs in relation to
seniority and inﬂation.

The minimum endowment
for Pitt is $10,000 for a
scholarship fund. To fund a
professorship it takes $1.2
million, and $1.5 million is
required for a chair of a
department, which is usually
a professor’s position.

With over 700 funds at
Pitt. the largest is the school
of medicine with 136 differ-
ent endowments, totaling in

. market value over $148 mil-

lion.
The year’s return percent-

age for the performance of
college and university

endowments dropped from

13.4 percent in 1993 to 2.9
percent in 1994. A return is
the amount of money one
makes on an investment.
Thisyear Pitt’s return was
1.5 percent.

Although below the aver-
age for this year, Pitt is
above the norm for a five-
year period and a three—year

V period at 9.6 percent.

“The thing is to manage
the money for today and the
next year and the next year,
it has to be a safe invest-
ment. If you’ve made
money, then you’ve effec-
tively implemented the poli-
cy, and [Pitt] has succeeded
in doing that,” said
Stunkard.

Harvard has the wealthiest
endowment fund, topping
the list at over $6 billion. In
relation to Pitt, comparable
schools like the University
of Cincinnati came in just
below Pitt in 45th with over
$383 million, the University
of Houstonranks 94th with
over $200 million and
Temple University ranks
184th with $85 million.

 Who needs ya?  

“I’m back,” Michael Jordan said to announce his return to
basketball. “Who needs ya?” ought to be the reply of the bas-
ketball fans at large. Yes, Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson
has hailed this as an emotional event, but Jordan has simply
proved the validity of an old truism: “When the going gets
tough, the tough get going.”

The going in baseball got tough, so Jordan got going, right
back to the basketball court. The White Sox weren’t keeping
him in the limelight, thus his ability to keep his face on the

According to the Post-Gazette, rookie forward Dickey ,3”; j’ "’

Simpkins was placed on the injured list to make room for
Jordan. That hero worship goes too far in professional sports is
evidenced by the inﬂated salaries of the stars, but this shows
that even if someone works hard and makes it, they can still
have their shot at 15 minutes of fame taken by someone who
could not get his shot elsewhere.

There's nothing positive that can come out of Jordan’s come-
back. He left at the pinnacle of his career. Very few athletes
have ever done that, and the great ones that h_ung around past
their prime were often hampered by nagging injuries or deplet-
ed skills. Jordan is no Kareem-Abdul Jabbar, he won't be
around until he is forty. Centers have more longevity, but
guards lose their games much more quickly.

That would defeat Jordan’s purpose. The one morsel of good
Jordan can salvage by coming back is if he can ignite the
mediocre Bulls to another championship. But that’s unlikely to
happen since he’s been out of the game too long. _

Let the old man retire to the golf course and leave room for
the new players coming up. You don’t build strong teams by
bumping talented young players. If the Bulls aren’t doing well
in his absence. then now more than ever they need to work on
building a strong team, not trying to elevate a glory hound
whose games are numbered. _

The Bulls have l7 games remaining this season. They will
probably do well in this final run up to the playoffs. Yet, the
sacrifice which will be made in letting him return will be too
great a cost.

The lack of commitment he demonstrated to his new sport is
deplorable. The fact that hecan just walk on and take up
where he left off at the expense of other players is injurious to
the rest of the team. Finally, his leaving baseball smacks suspi-
ciously of a financially motivated move, which is capitalism in
its worst form.

It is time America recognizes reality and moves on

bad a revelation the other
day on something I have
been brooding over for
some time. I was sitting in my
Oxford c1assroom.and we
were discussing the dire straits
of John Major’s government.
For those of you who are not
well acquainted with British
Politics, the Conservative
Party has dominated the politi-
cal scene in Britain the last
few decades and has ruled
since 1979. In 1992 Major
won a squeaker election, one
the Conservatives were not
expected to win and won with
a very small majority. Since

that time the popularity of the ‘

Conservatives has plummeted
such that the opposition party,
Labour, is up by over 40 per-
centage points in the polls
(Labour 60+, Conservatives
low 20s and Liberal
Democrats 15-20).

In a two party plus system
(the Liberal Demodrats get a
lot of the vote but very few
seats) this is an unbelievable
lead. It is common between
elections for the ruling party to
lose popularity and then come
back again, but the plummet of
the Conservatives is unprece-
dented in British political his-
tory.

But why is this occurring?
The British economy IS NOT
in a shambles. In fact it is in
better shape than it has been in
years. Since WWII there has
been an index combining such
things as interest rates, inﬂa-
tion, mortgage rates and unem-
ployment. This index has been
used to predict the
Conservative percentage of the
vote and has been amazingly
accurate for 50 years.
According to this index today,
however, the Conservatives
should be around 55 percent.
The political system has been
tamed on its head.

We also discussed in class
the similarities of this phe-
nomenon and what has been
happening to President
Clinton. He has had very simi-
lar problems. The economy is

on the upswing, he has had
some strong success in foreign
policy, yet his popularity con-
tinued to plummet resulting in
the Republican landslide last
November. I have argued since
then that the “shift to the
right” which the news media
loves to hype so much (the
British media believes it even
more than the U.S. media) is
fundamentally inaccurate.

First of all while the swing
in seats was immense, the
Republicans still only won a
very slim majority. Secondly,
the electorate has been under-
going massive mood swings in
recent years. Bush went from
being the most popular presi-
dent in history to being run out
of office, and we also had the
biggest third-party threat in
decades.

Furthermore, the electorate
did not identify strongly with
Republican ideology, but

rather were voting on the basis’

of dissatisfaction with Clinton;
and at long last anti-incumban-
cy is actually being expressed
at the ballot box, whereas 10
years ago the earth would have
to move for an incumbent to
be voted out of office.

Finally, since November,
what I predicted would happen
has. The Republicans are per-
ceived as being in power, and
their popularity has slipped
while Clinton’s has risen.

This voter craziness is by no
means limited to the United
States and Britain. France and
Canada have had massive
electoral swings in their parlia-
ments (the Canadian
Conservative Party going from
ruling to near non-existence).
The always volatile Italian
government is in complete dis-
array, and other European
countries seem to have the
potential for similar occur-
rences to happen in upcoming
elections.

So what is causing all of
this? Back in January, I
attempted to describe the
American phenomenon as a
general voter dissatisfaction

caused by a number of factors
coming to a head in the early
1990s (a combination of the
effects of Vietnam, Watergate,
the end of the Cold War, the
increasing lack of respect the
news media has for the gov-
ernment, sensational journal-
ism in general and a few other
factors). But while I still
believe that this is partially the
case in America, itgdoes not
explain what is happening in
the world context.

What finally came to me as
we discussed this in class was
that in the wake of the Cold
War and the “new world
order” which is emerging (in
what form no one knows), the
“rules” of the political game
are being re-written. This hap-
pened after WWI and WWII
as well. '

The assumptions which
politicians have counted on to
win them elections are being
radically altered. Immediately
after the two world wars it was
a little different — there were
clear beginnings and ends to
these monumental upheavals.
But the Cold War was differ-
ent. NO one can identify
exactly when it began and
when it really ended, expect
that it is most certainly over
now.

This transfers to the “re-
writing” of the political rules.
It is not as clear that it is
occurring, as it was clear after
the two wars. But I believe it
is happening, except in fits and
starts, and it looks as though it
may be a long drawn out
process.

In a two-party system like
the United States’, it is easy to
interpret these swings in the
short term as simple shifts to
the right or left. But this is not
what is happening. It is time
America recognizes that reali-
ty and tries to move on.

Heathcote’s career came to an
abrupt end after his third-seed-

dus to the lowly Weber State
in the first round of the NCAA

I IOUITIEIITICIIIL.

Perhaps all Heathcote’s gut-

prematurely. And with
Heathcote’s failure to advance
his team past the opening
round, so went the opportunity
to get on the back of the Big

ride him deep into the tourna-

15th-seeded Santa Clara, only
the second time in tournament

With Arizona’s departure,
coupled with Florida’s loss

The Pitt wrestling team did
what it, hasn’t done in four
years — have two of its
members qualify for All-
America honors this week-
end at Iowa City.

Pitt’s J.J. Fasnacht and
John Withrow both finished
in the top eight of their
respective divisions to quali-
fy for All-American status.
Unlike in other sports, where
All—Americans are voted on
by the media, only the top
eight finishers in each divi-
sion earn the honor.

Not since Scott Hovan and
Perry Miller in the 1990-91
season has the Pitt wrestling
team had two All-American
qualifiers.

Fasnacht finished the tour-
nament in eighth place of the
134-pound division, winning
four matches and dropping
three.

Fasnacht blew out his first
round opponent Blake
Tompkins of Oregon, 17-2.
A loss in the quarterfinals
and then three straight con-
solation victories pushed him
over the top with enough vic-
tories to claim the honors
despite losing his final two

The Pitt baseball team raised
its season record to 14-2 this
weekend after completing a four-
game home sweep of Davis and
Elkins, Gannon University and
Slippery Rock.

“Each day somebody different
seems to be stepping up,” said
pitcher Gregg Mrochko, who
became Pitt’s all-time winning
pitcher yesterday after a 12-2
win in the second game of a dou-
bleheader against Slippery Rock.

The person who stepped up '

during Friday’s game against
Davis and Elkins was starting
pitcher Chris Bean. The Panthers
won 15-0 as Bean, who notched
his first victory, only allowed
one hit while letting no Davis
and Elkins baserunners to reach
second base.

“My slider was working well,”
Bean said. “I kept the ball down
and worked the pitches in and

I out.”

Bean also said that he had
good control and command over
all his pitches.

“I’m glad to see Bean doing
well now that he’s got the
chance,” said pitcher Murad Agi.

During Saturday’s game
against Gannon, pitcher Donnie
Vasey evened his season record
to 1-1 after allowing one run on
six hits in a 9-1 rout.

Ace pitcher starts season smoking with 5-0 record

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

Pitcher Tedde Campbell
notched his fifth win yesterday
afternoon in the first half of
Pitt’s double-header sweep of
Slippery Rock University, giv-
ing the senior fastballer a per-
fect 5-0 record while establish-
ing him as one of the Big
East’s most formidable threats.

Campbell, a right—hander.
struck out eight in 8 2/3
innings. He leads the team in
strikeouts with 32, averaging
one per inning.

“They actually hit the ball a
lot better than I expected,”
Campbell said, pointing out
Slippery Rock’s two home
runs. “Those two hits and a
couple of errors accounted for
most of their runs.”

Slippery Rock knocked out
eight hits against Campbell,
who gave up an uncharacteris-
tic five earned runs. After yes-
terday’s game, his ERA stood
at 1.97.

“It is pretty good that I_got
hit around a little bit,”
Campbell said. “I guess you
could say it is a wake up call.”

Campbell only had one more
win during all of last season
than he now does two weeks
into the 1995 season, but he
said he does not believe he’s
pitching much differently.

“Last season I lost a couple

Campbell said he hopes for
consistency this season. V

“My fastball is my best
pitch, but that is because I’m
able to spot it well.” Campbell
said. “I believe my other pitch-
es, the slider and [split—finger
fastball], can be just as effec-
tive, but I’m really known as a
fastball pitcher.”

Campbell said his ability to
put his fastball exactly where
he wants will have a big
impact on his success this sea-

“If you spot your fastball
well, you’re going to be suc-
cessful,” Campbell said. “Even

in the major leagues, the key is ’

to work it in and out with pre-
cision.”

In addition to his own per-
formance, Campbell said he is
counting on a strong season
from the rest of the Panther
hurlers. .

“I think we’ve got a great
pitching staff,” Campbell said.
“We have another senior, Greg
Mrochko, who is really a team
leader.”

Mrochko finished last sea-
son leading Pitt with nine
wins. He also won yesterday,
giving him a 4-0 record and
the all—time Pitt record for
wins with 18.

This is how the rest of the
tournament should shape up:

In the Southeast bracket, No.
1 seed Kentucky will take
down Mario Bennett and the
pesky Arizona State Sun
Devils. In the lower half, North
Carolina’s sophomore tandem
of Rasheed Wallace and Jerry
Stackhouse will be too much
for John Thompson’s
Georgetown Hoyas. Led by
freshman point guard Allen
Iverson, the new Hoya style of
run-and-gun won’t be enough
for NC’s athleticism and poise.

Carolina and Kentucky will
duke it out for the Final Four,
setting up a classic coaching
matchup —— Rick Pitino vs.
Dean Smith. Both have been
there before, but this time
Kentucky’s menacing pressure
and endless depth will send
Deano and company back to
Tobacco Road with nothing but
the bragging rights of getting
to the Elite Eight again.

Southeast winner:
Kentucky

The Midwest_is a tad trickier.
Kansas bumps heads with
Virginia, setting up one of the

‘ best matchups of the touma-

ment. Granted, the Jayhawks
have enormous depth and Roy
Williams finds a different man
to carry his team each game,
but Virginia’s hunger will pre-
vail. The Cavaliers’ defense is
stifling. Their three-guard
offense, which is often erratic,
will step up and pull it out.
Although Virginia doesn’t have
the depth to match with
Kansas’ three 7-footers, but
this 22-8 squad has played
underrnatched all season in the

A nation’s best conference.

After eeking a win out
against Syracuse last night,
Arkansas will make fairly easy
work of the undisciplined
Memphis squad. With the same
team as last year, the Hogs
without a doubt have the most
talent in the tournament. It’s
just a matter of time for them
to explode. It will happen.

Midwest winner: Arkansas

The Wake Forest Demon

UMass is just too deep for

There’s always a snippet of
painful history in the -last 10

‘years for UCLA. The Bruins

have talent galore, but Jim
Harrick always finds a way to
mess it up. UCLA dodged a
major bullet last night when

Tyus Edney took the ball coast '

to coast to beat Missouri, and it
will happen again against
Mississippi State.

The lower half of the bracket
is .a doozy. Maryland ‘vs.
UConn. ACC ace against the
Big East beast. The young
Terps and unanimous All-
American center Joe Smith‘
will edge out the multi-faceted
Huskies by a basket.

Again, the ACC’s tough
schedule has thickened the skin
of this Maryland squad that
was in the Elite Eight last year.
The Terps can match UCLA’s
athleticism, and will ultimately
pull off the win over the No. 1
team in the country. Keep in
mind, UCLA is a notorious

choker.

°From page 10
and [junior college] transfers
that they can step in and play
ball here,” Campbell said.
“They have just as much abili-
ty as [Greg and I].”

As far as his goals this sea-
son, Campbell said he prefers
to take them game by game.

“Stats are for the end of the
season. If you look too early,
you lose focus,” Campbell
said. ‘‘I really do not want to
get caught up in that.”

Campbell admitted, howev-
er, he does have a Big East
Championship victory on his
wish list for the offseason.

“My goal is to win a [Big
East Championship] game,”
he said. “Last year I really lost
a heartbreaker.”

After having the best con-
ference record in the Big East
last year and gaining the top
seed in the championship tour-
nament, Pitt was the first team
knocked out of the postseason
tourney. Campbell pitched the
first game in which Pitt lost by
one run after leading for the
first seven innings.

Even though he said Pitt as
a team has had some trouble
“playing within our system”
so far this year, its record does
not reflect too many problems.
and Campbell said the team
will improve.

“Some players are off to a
bit of a slow start,” he said.
“[Tyler] Shantz and [Jon]
DeBarnardis are big offensive
producers. and as soon we get
to playing our type of base-
ball, we’ll be in good shape.”
