move to the University of Illinois

tions, of associate provost of Un-
dergraduate Affairs and director

.55. ment Center, respectively.

Jack Daniel said he decided to
stay after finding he would not as-

said these included involvement
with the budgeting process and_
and decisions on tenure and

The campaign was organized
to fight President Reagan's pro-
posed 46 to 48 percent cuts in
spending for post-secondary edu-
cation for the 1988 budget. Ac-
cording to information gathered

NEW YORK (AP) — Andy
Warhol,lthe pale prince of Pop
Art who turned images of, soup
cans and superstars into museum
pieces, died Sunday of a heart at-
tack. He is believed to have been
58. .

Warhol grew up in McKees-
port, Pa., and attended the Car-
negie Institute of Technology,
now part of Carnegie —— Mellon
University.

One of the most influential and
famous artists of his time, Warhol
died at New York Hospital a day
after undergoing gall bladder sur-
gery. A cardiac arrest team
worked for an hour to save him,
without success.

Slender, pallid and soft-spoken,
instantly recognizable in ‘his
blond wig, Warhol abandoned a
successful career as a commercial
illustrator in the 19505 to gain

with his position.

”Whi|e I was in Chicago, there
were people looking at the
house,” he said. ”I was there to
clarify the specific responsibilities
I would have, but I was unable to

. resolve that.”

Daniel said he had spoken with
President Wesley Posvar and
Vice Provost Donald Henderson
before he departed for Chicago
the last time during the second
week of February.

”Most people were surprised at
my return,” he said. ”But I talked
with both of them before I went
to Chicago and told them I was
having difficulty.”

He said Posvar and Henderson
were awaiting his final decision

by the Governmental Relations
Committee, approximately 75
percent of all Pitt students receive

financial aid of. some type and

may be affected by the proposed
budget cuts.

Among the proposed changes
is the.expansion of the Income
Contingent Loan Program. The
ICLP differs from the existing
Guaranteed Student Loan Pro-
gram in that a student may bor-
row larger amounts, and the
interest on the loan is based on
a variable percentage rate.

According to a memo from the

‘Govenmental Relations Commit-

tee, a student may borrow $2,500
in hisfreshman year, $3,500 in
his sophomore year and $4,000

worldwide fame as the principal
exponent of the Pop Art
movement. - ‘

He won fame‘ in the early
1960s by producing repeated
silk-screen images of common-
place items such as Campbell's
soup cans and went on to estab-
lish himself as the emotionless
recorder of the images of his day.

Warhol was an iconoclast and
an eccentric, rejecting accepted
conventions of art, society and
behavior. ’’In the future,” he
wrote in a 1968 exhibition cata-
log, ”everyone will be world-
famous for 15- minutes.”

But Warhol's fame endured for
decades, through his work in un-
derground film, his creation of
the gossipy Interview magazine,

his portrayals of members of the '

glamorous jet-set in which he

at that time and, therefore, were
not surprised when he decided to
stay.

”This was kind of a big.oppor—
tunity, and we [he and his wife]
were disappointed that it didn't
work out,” he said.~”We were
fortunate to come to the place
where we've had so much suc-

. cess and enjoyment.”

Henderson said he will con-
tinue with his concentrated work
on black recruitment and reten-
tion in all facets of the university.

”|n aboutone or two weeks, I
expect to have a report from a
committee I had formed to study
the status of blacks at this univer-
sity,” he said. ”Before the aca-
demic year is over [I hope] to
conclude a major study on this

‘ issue.”

for each year beyond sophomore
year, up to his fifth year.

Interest on the Income Contin-
gent Loans varies with the
government's Treasury Bills. Un-
like the GSL, interest on the ICL
is not federally subsidized, and
the ‘interest accumulates while a
student is in school.

According to the GRC’s memo,
a student can pay interest on the
ICL while still in school or allow

-the interest to accumulate and

pay itin monthly installments af-
ter graduation.
Repayment of the loans are

ter graduation, with no deadline
for repayment. The GRC pointed

was one of the first people to real-.

ly become a star as an artist, and
once celebrity came, he certain-
ly enjoyed it.” ‘

”He was a serious artist whose
posture was unseriousness,” said
William Rubin, the museum's
chief curator of painting and
sculpture. ”He was a pioneer of
image-appropriating Pop Art, and
the implications of his ideas are
still unfolding in Post-
Modernism.”

Born Andrew Warhola, one of
three sons of Czech immigrants,
Andy Warhol grew up in the in-
dustrial city of McKeesport, Pa.,
near Pittsburgh. A delicate youth,
he suffered three nervous break-
downs as a child.

His fathergdied when he was
14, but he pulled’ together the
money to attend the Carnegie In-

ttsburgh Pop artist dies of heart atack 

stitute of Technology, now Car-
negie Mellon University,
graduating in 1949 with a
bachelor's degree in pictorial de-

sign. He moved to New York '
City, cut the final vowel from his _

name and quickly found success
as a commercial artist.

_ Warhol grew restless in the .
constraints of that work. He be.-

gan showing drawings in 1956
and began to paint in earnest four
years later.

Again, success came quickly. _

In 1961, a Manhattan department
store placed his ”Dick Tracy,” a
giant likeness of the comic strip
hero, in its front window. The
next year was Warhol's
watershed: ’’Campbell Soup
Cans,” the work that placed him
at the forefront of the Pop move-
ment, was shown in Los Angeles.

FAA districts surprised at scope of investigation

PITTSBURGH — The Federal
Aviation Administration, troubled
by a series of fatal crashes of med-
ical helicopters and airplanes, to-
day will begin a 60-day
investigation of all the nation's air
ambulance programs, according
to a published report.

”Our inspectors will be look-
ing at all aspects of their pro-
grams, including equipment,
maintenance, training, pilots’
hours and operations,” said
David Kress, head of the FAA’s
newly formed medical evacua-
tion task force.

Several managers of the 80
FAA district offices said they were
notified Friday of the investiga-
tion and were surprised at its
scope, The Pittsburgh Press
reported in its Sunday editions.

During the past 13 months, two
patients, six pilots and 11 flight
nurses and medics died when
their ambulance aircraft plunged
to the ground in six separate ac-
cidents.

Guerilla groups claim
liability for attack

JERUSALEM — A hand grenade
attack wounded 12 Israeli bord-
er guards and five Palestinian by-
standers Sunday in a crowded
street outside the Old City of
Jerusalem and sent hundreds of
foreign tourists and shoppers run-
ning for cover. Four Palestinian
guerilla groups claimed responsi-
bility.

Dozens of green—uniformed
border patrol guards immediate-
ly converged on the area of stone-
paved streets near the Damascus
Gate and began searches. They
detained more than 70 Arabs at
gunpoint.

The grenade exploded 50 yards
from the gate, one of seven en-
trances to the ancient, walled
city. 7

Police said two victims were in

‘ serious condition.

Ambulances sped to the site,
and bloody bandages littered the
sidewalk where medics gave first
aid.

Most wanted suspects
caught near Orleans

PARIS — Police swept onto an
isolated farm near Orleans and,
without fi ring a shot, arrested four
of France's most wanted terrorist
suspects, the Interior Ministry
said Sunday.

Two of the four were sought in
the assassination three months
ago of Georges Besse, president
of the state-run Renault au-
tomakers.

All four — two men and two
women — are considered leaders
of the extreme left terrorist group
Direct Action. Police said that

with the arrests Saturday night, all
top leaders of the terrorist group
had been caught.

Police also seized a stockpile of
arms, explosives, money and in-
criminating documents at the
farm in north—central France, the
ministry said.

Case is dismissed for

insufficient evidence

PHILADELPHIA —— A man who
spent six months awaiting trial on
robbery charges is free after the
case against him was dismissed
because a prosecutor said there
was not enough evidence.

Although Sylvester Kitchen was
positively identified last fall by a
cab driver who said Kitchen
robbed him at knifepoint and
stole his cab, new evidence
called that identification into
question, authorities said.

A defense attorney turned up
records supporting the north
Philadelphia man's repeated as-
sertions that he had been work-
ing in South» Carolina the day of
the robbery, the Inquirer report-
ed in Saturday's edition.

Floating not only feels good  it is good. Hospital studies reveal ﬂoating is successful
treatment for many physical ailments. It stimulates the production ot endorphins (the body's
own opiates) while reducing adrenal activity associated with stress and heart disease.
Floating has been successfully used in treating anxiety. cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal
ailments. migrane. and tension headaches. hyp'ertenslon and chronic pain. it's the natural,
drug-tree way to better health.‘ Floating has had positive results in behavior modification.
Preliminary research indicates lloating causes a reduction or elimination of habits such
as smoking, drinking and drug usage. Floating is particularly ettective in counteracting
addiction withdrawal symptoms. It can help you through the discomfort of quitting addictive

HTHE PITT NEWS, Monday, FebruaFY 23, 1937s’  I I

Justice, hate — so what

Prejudice is running rampant in
the world again, just ask John
Demjanjuk. Or maybe his name

~ is Ivan the Terible, or maybe

none of the above. See, that's the
whole point of a trial that's being

held in a converted theater in.

Israel.

John Demjanjuk is a guy from
Poland who immigrated to the
United States about 30 years ago.
Since then he's been an auto
worker in Cleveland. He has a fa-
mily and spends a lot of time in
church. A

Ivan the Terrible was a prison
guard at the Treblinka concentra-
tion camp during World War II.
While the camp was busy putting
850,000 people to death, old
Ivan was clubbing. people on
their way to the gas chambers.
That bastard, wherever he is,
should hang. His crimes merit
nothing less than death.

But are John Demjanjuk and
Ivan the Terrible the same per-
son.Ah, there's the rub. We real-
ly don't know for sure. He hasn't
been proven guilty yet. At least,
not officially.

The ,.United States Justice
department thinks he's guilty. A
good many Jews here and in Is-
rael think he's, guilty.

His friends in Cleveland think
he's innocent. Members of his

, church in Cleveland think he's in-

nocent
. So what? Those people, all of
them put together, crying for
what they_ think is right, making
the loudest noise they can
muster, should not be heard in
the courtroom. That just isn't the
way the justice system in any
country should work.
It should be up to the courts in

 

 

MA1"I'HE
THORNTON

Israel to prove him either guilty
or not, based on careful consider-
ation of the facts in the case. Sad-
ly, it doesn't look like a fair trial
has more than an ice cube’s
chance in hell of happening.
Demjanjuk was a citizen of the
United States until recently, when
the government revoked his
citizenship and deported him to
Israel for trial. In Israel, he was
greeted by a fair number of peo-
ple screaming for his blood. Oh
boy, looks like we’ have the epi-
tome of justice in the works here.

If he is guilty, let justice be
done. If not, I have to wonder
what's going totbecome of him.

Are we going to give his
citizenship back with a humbled
speech and a 'sorry guy’? Are we
going to let him be the ‘man
without a_ country? Are we even
going to care?

There has always been a dan-
gerous element -of emotion-that
has sometimes been substituted
for justice. In onea story in The
Pittsburgh Press, a man was quot-

ed as saying that "this is going to
be a curse on them [Jews] and
their children and their grandchil-
dren, just as was the crucifixion
of Jesus Christ.”

He was talking about the Israe-
lies prosecuting the case. Similar
sentiments have been expressed
on both sides, and have even
been brought up in. court. I may
be way off base, but it seems that
one of the things that makes a
justice system work is attention
only to the facts of the case and
not the public’s perception of
them. _

I'm not pleading the case for
Demjanjuk or for the Israelies -
they need to do that for them-
selves in court. I only ask that we
stop to look a little more closely
at our biases. When we hate a
group of people for the actions of
a few of_ them, we are severely
limiting our ability to make intel-
ligent decisions.

If we were all able to judge a
person more often on their per-
sonal merits, in‘ a court of law
when necessary, we would be
much closer to the ideal of equal-
ity we all pay so much lip serv-

ice to. Not that we would be able , I

to_ be fair in all cases. The humans
as a race and we as individuals
have a dismal record there at
best.

John Demjanjuk, if he is inno-
cent, would surely like to see
justice served. If not, he is no
doubt one of the most worried
men on the planet, and with
good reason. We should shy,
though, from ‘the justice of the
mob, which s'eems.t_0‘ make a biz-
zare association between justice
and vindication. Revenge should
stay the hell out of the courtroom.

Condoms from the pulpit

It's 1987, and the word con-

dom is being spoken for the first ,

time on network television.

It'.s 1987, and for years we have
shown men and women having
sexual intercourse on both net-
work and cable television,
whether it be explicit or implied.

It's 1987, and for the first time,

condom advertisements willbe ,

aired on network television.
It's not bad enough we have to

tolerate hemorrhoid commer-.

cials, commercials for post-

menstrual douches and feminine ’

hygeine products like Carefree
panty shields.

I don't, for one minute,.enjoy

J watching a commercial for Tam-

pax tampons with my 69-year-old
grandmother. It's'embarr'assing.

So now, they're going to adver-

tise condoms. I'm going to have _

to make sure when I visit my
grandma, we're either watching

the Disney Channel or engaged ’

in an intense,‘ all-night game of
Yahtzee.

I bet you think that means I am
against advertisement of con-
traceptives. On the contrary. I ful-
ly support the advertisement of
contraceptives on television.
They've been showing us how to
have sex for years; it's about time
they show us how to do it safely.

But the use of advertisements

on network television has been »

defined as an-AIDS prevention
measure, not as a contraceptive

     

  

         

    

. FRANCE
SANSIG

.. ,1-_¢.. .

However, the Catholic Church
has already said the advertise-
ments will encourage immoral
activity. «

Of course, we're dealing with
a group of people who just a few
years ago pardoned Galileo for
insisting the world was round.

Condom ' advertisements
should. be aired on television and
should have been for a long time.
These advertisements do not en-
courage sexual activity. That is
ridiculous. They encourage safe
sexual activity. '

Those who choose to have sex-
ual relations will do so whether
or not advertisements are aired
on the networks. Sex has been a

part of life since the beginning of_

mankind. There were no condom
commercials then. Sex has had
.it's srampant periods, and through
them ‘t

     

 

  

dom commercials. The promiscu-
ous sexual attitude of the '60s has
given way to a more conservative
social atmosphere and greater

‘ awareness of the consequences

of mindless sex. AIDS is partially
responsible for this tide of sexu-
al conservatism, but before that,
there were venereal disease,

’ syphillis, gonnorhea, and herpes.

There were no condom com-
mercials then, either.

So would it be erroneous to as-
sume that advertisements for con-
doms will in no way affect the
instances of premarital and extra-_
marital sex but could perhaps

‘lower the incidence of AIDS, of

unwanted pregnancies, abor-
tions, single—pare_nt homes? Is that
bad? "

Opposing the advertisements
of condoms is an insane cop-out.
Being against the advertisement
of condoms is merely advocating

more of the aforementioned

tragedies.

Instead of criticizing the adver-
tisements, maybe more should be

like the Catholic priest in New

York who passed out condoms at

"one of his church services.

He took extreme action, but
the situation has become ex-
treme. It has merited the attention
it. is receiving. It has merited the
long-overdue and possibly too-
late advertising. We will eventu-
ally get used to it, the same way

our parents got used to watching-

" Dec. 23, 1985. Inside the

  
  

oh my God_.a 
Vanna White—out    

I pulled it out of my desk
drawer and looked at it. It
was a letter, postmarked

envelope was a card with
an illustration of gold pop-
pies on the front.

The message on the card
was hand—written in black
ink. The -writer said that a
column I had written about

 

’\

  ,.., ,.,.,

 

her made her feel "extra
special!” It said, "Next time
I'm in Chicago, perhaps

you'll let me buy you a White Castle, as they are my all- time

favorites!"

It was signed, "Sincerely, Vanna Wnite."

This is all so weird. I just read a wire service story that quot-
ed Vanna's manager as saying that he couldn't get anyone to
take his phone calls until "a syndicated columnist printed a sur-

vey that said that Vanna White was the most admired person 4 .

among young American girls." After that, he said, things start-
ed happening. You know the rest. Vanna is the cultural

“phenomenon of the moment. She was just on the cover of

Newsweek. -

The thing is that I was kidding when I wrote that. In the
column — it appeared Dec. 15, I985 — I said, "Who is emerg-
ing as the No. 1 idol and role model for young American girls
today? Not Nancy Reagan. Not Meryl Streep. Not Gloria Stei-
nem. Not Jean Kirkpatrick."

I said that the No. I idol was Vanna White. _
. I meant it as a joke. I was hooked on Wheel of Fortune, and
I thought it was funny that a woman should have, as her entire
job, the duty of turning letters on a gameboard. I said in the
column, "You might not know who Vanna White is." And it
was true — I couldn't make the assumption that most readers
had heard of VannaAWhite.

In fact, when I called the Wheel of Fortune offices in Califor-.

nia to get a photograph of her in 1985, they said they didn't
even know if they had one. They'd have to hunt oneup. And
when I said that I would like to talk to Vanna, they just gave
me her home phone number. Just like that.

When I called her in 1985, she acted amazed that anyone
would want to interview her. After the column ran, she told
me that a friend of hers in Chicago had called her to say that
there was a story about her in the Chicago Tribune. "My friend
couldn't believe it," Vanna said.

Ah, well. Time has passed. It no longer matters that there was,
infact, no "survey" of American girls and whom they idolized.
Perception became reality, and now it is hard to imagine any-
one who is a bigger star than Vanna. ’ s

The other day, I talked to her manager, Ray Manzella.

"|t's true," he said. "Before that column came out, I would
call people about Vanna, and they would say, 'Who? How do
you spell that name?’ "

Manzell said that even though Vanna was appearing on a
popular game show at the time, "I couldn't get anyone to pay
attention to her.” ‘

I was watching a television news show, and the commenta-

. tor said that she didn't know what the world had come to "when

Vanna White can be- the winner of a survey of whom Ameri-
can girls admire the most."

Sigh. . I

Vanna called me the other day. ‘ - -~

"I still can't believe what has happened," she said. "I go to
the supermarket now, and I see my face smiling back at.me
from the covers of all those magazines."

I asked her if she remembered writing me the thank—you note
after I had written about her.

"Of course," she said. "It was such a surprise when you called
back then and wanted to interview me. It was brand new to
me. When my friend in Chicago called me and said there was
a story about me in the paper, Imade her read it to me over
the phone. I sat down right away and wrote you a note because
I wasn't used to being written about. I still have that column
framed." .

I didn't have the heart to tell her that I had really been kid-
ding around in that first column. Who would ever seriously be-
lieve that a game-show-letter-turner could turn into an idol?‘
Satire. That's what the column was supposed to be. Satire.

It doesn't matter now. There's going to be a Vanna White
book this spring, and she has just signed a contract to license
various Vanna White products. The joke has come true.

I have this vision of Vanna and me sitting in the White Castle
together. Somehow, I doubt that it's ever going to happen.

Panel to submit Contra report to White House

By Merril Hartson

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —- A three-
member panel with few investi-
gators and no‘ subpoena power is
about to deliver what White
House officials concede will be
the harshest report yet on the
lran—Contra affair.

”Hard hits, I'm sure there are.
Bad news, I'm sure there is,” a
senior Reagan administration offi-
cial said of the Tower commis-
sion's report on
arms—and-money connection
scheduled for release Thursday.,

This official, speaking on.

grounds of anonymity, said, ”The
public doesn't want to wait
another six months to find out

.what happened.”

» The panel report may for the
first time shed light on the extent
to which President Reagan was
personally involved in the
decision-makingon the Iranian
arms sales.

Former Sen. John Tower (R-
Texas) who heads the panel had
promised ”a coldly objective” in-
vestigative effort. His commission
interviewed scores of figures in
the case, and itsmembers flew to
Paris to interview two key_
Mideast middlemen in the arms
deal, Adnan Khashoggi and
Manucher Ghorbanifar.

The commission. also inter-
viewed Reagan twice, and ob-
tained from the White'House a
series of_type-written transcripts
of the president's hand—written
notes that Reagan's lawyers con-

the

sidered ”relevant” to the investi-
gation. They also gained access
to thousands of computer mes-
sages known as ”PROFS~” and
other White House records.

On Nov. 26, the day after an-
nouncing the resignation of Na-
tional Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter and the firing of Na-
tional Security Council staff
deputy Oliver L. North, Reagan
said the special review board
should ”look at the ‘manner in
which foreign and national secu-
rity policies I established have
been implemented by the NSC
-staff.”

The board's two other mem-
bers are Brent Scowcroft, nation-
al security adviser to President
Ford, and former Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie.

Scowcroft told reporters on

’ Dec. 1 that ”we’re not looking at

individual culpability for any-
thing.” But he also said the panel
wanted to learn what went wrong
within the NSC. "

The following day, Reagan, in
a brief Oval'Office address to the
nation on the emerging lran-
Contra flap, said that ”no area of
the NSC staff activitieswill be im-
mune from review.”

Tower noted at the time that it
was not the commissionfs chart-
er ”to make findings of guilt or in-
nocence or come. to any
conclusions on that point.”

Asked.about the panel's lack’ of

V authority to compel testimony, he _

said, ”We believe that anyone
we need to talk to who is not in
government will volunteer. If that

Six Pitt students attended the
Pennsylvania Conference on
Graduate Opportunities for
Black and Hispanic Students
in Philadelphia.

The February conference
was initiated by Philadelphia
representative Chaka Fattah. It
was designed to encourage
more black and Hispanic col-
lege students to attend gradu-
ate and professional school, as
well as to stress the impor-
tance of higher education for
minorities.

The conference contained
student workshops designed
to provide the students with
information concerning gradu-
ate and professional process-
es,_ such as test—taking,
admissions, financial aid and ‘
mentoring.

Financial aid in particular
was stressed. Various guest

due to a lack of financial

The speakers stressed that
money should not be a factor
when deciding whether or not
to further your , education,
primarily because of the avail-
ability of fellowships and as- ’
sistantships for minorities in
higher education.

The students also had the
opportunity to speak with and
listen to successful individuals
who further stressed the im-
portance of higher education. ~

Dr. Niara Sudarkasa, presi-

‘dent of Lincoln University in

speakers,- stressed the need for
”creative and innovative solu-
tions to the problem of declin-
ing enrollment of black and
Hispanic students in graduate
and professional studies.

’’In 1982, only 12 percent of

of Hispanic students complet-
ed undergraduate studies,”
continued Sudarkasa.

The speakers agreed that a
primary goal of the conference
was to raise such statistics.

Black enrollment at the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh and other major

universities is on the decline, and

_ this decline is a cause of concern

for many black faculty and ad-
ministrators around the campus.

According to Gail Austin, staff
assistant of recruitment and ad-
missions for the University Com-
munity Education Program, black
enrollment held steady from
1973, the peak year for black en-
rollment at Pitt, to 1980. Since
then, there has been a slight
decline. According to Austin, one

Pitt's black enrollment is on a steady decline .

f'\

reason for the decline is that
financial aid for minority students
has decreased.

”Reagan consistently defended
student aid tests by saying they
primarily affected students who
did not need help," she said;
”However, since 1978, aid
money to white students has in-
creased 8 percent, while aid to
black students has actually
decreased 4.4 percent. Even
when the House and the Senate
have been able to forestall bigger
cuts that the Reagan administra-

tion planned, black students par-I
" ticularly were threatened just by

the notion that there would be

II
c

cuts

Austin said the threat stopped
several black students from going
to school. 9

Donald Frazier, executive assis-
tant of the Black Action Society
said, ”Black enrollment has
decreased due to financial aid. I
have had friends who have had
to leave school due to the lack of
funds.”

Frazier, a junior at Pitt, almost
had to leave for the same reason.
”Money is the biggest factor and
obstacle that black students
face,” he said.

Although the decline of finan-
cial aid has stifled black enroll-

ment, other factors have
contributed. According to Dr.Jack
Daniel, associate provost for Un-
dergraduate Programs, there are
two other major reasons for the
dechne.

”The number of minority stu-
dents that are graduating from
high school is on the decline,”
Daniel said. He also cited a lack
in ”the number of minority stu-
dents in Pennsylvania that have
the admission requirements of
the University of Pittsburgh.”

Daniel added, ”There [are] not
enough funds in the effort ...”

Daniel said the blame is not en-
tirely Pitt's. He pointed to sever-

..

 

al programs that Pitt is
conducting to aid in increasing
black enrollment.

”They [Pitt] have done a lot,”
Daniel said. ”They have scholar-
ship and merit programs based
on need. They've established
several formal programs such as
U—CEP and the Pitt Engineering
Impact Program. They have also
hired many minority recruits.”

Daniel said thjat even with all
that Pitt has contributed, there is
still more to be done.

He added, ”More things must
be done to make the university
more condusive to minority stu-

Psychologist fights charges of neglect

By Maud S. Beelman

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — A psy-
cho|ogist’s fight against a charge
that he failed to report a suspect-
ed case of child abuse could alter
doctor—patient relationships,
some observers say.

The impact, they say, could
come from court interpretation of
a Pennsylvania law compelling
psychologists to report such
cases. Dr. Karl Bartsch of State
College was charged Jan. 28 with
violating that law in connection
with an indecent assault case that
has since been dismissed.

A hearing on the charge, which
carries a fine of up to $300, is set
for Tuesday before District Justice

Clifford Yorks.

”Our plan is to fight this tooth-
and—n,ail,” said Roy Lisko,
Bartsch’s attorney. ”We don't
think that what he did was
wrong. He was protecting the in-
terest of his clients to the highest
degree.” ‘

Among issues psychologists

, want clarified on the law, which

is untested, is whether suspected

past abuse must be reported.
”This is a very important case,”
said Dr. Stephen Ragusea, a State
College psychologist. ”And the
way in which the law is interpret-
ed will affect how mental health
professionals treat their patients
for many, many years to come.”
Lisko has advised Bartsch not

to comment on the charge until .

after the hearing, and Lisko
declined to discuss specifics
about the case until the hearing.

Two weeks ago, Yorks dis-
missed the indecent assault
charge against former judge
Richard A. Behrens, ruling there
was not enough evidence after
the alleged victim refused to tes-
tify. Behrens resigned from the
bench in December.

’’I have no idea why Karl
Bartsch was charged. My bet is
the local police, because they
couldn't nail the judge, were
looking for some way to salvage
a chargeable case out of the in-
vestigation,” said Ragusea, who
also is president-elect of the
Pennsylvania Psychological As-
sociation’s Division on Clinical
Psychology.

State police in Hollidaysburg
and Blair County District Attor-
ney William J. Haberstroh deny
that suggestion. Haberstroh said
he learned Bartsch failed to report
and recommended that police
pursue the charge long before his
case against Behrens fell apart.

State police in Hollidaysburg
claim in their complaint that
Bartsch, 50, failed to report the
suspected abuse of the 16-year-
old alleged victim in the Behrens’
case after learning of it March 9,
1985. The abuse was alleged to
have occurred between Septem-
ber and December 1984.

State law mandates psycholo-
gists and other professionals to
report suspected child abuse only
if they learn of it directly from the
alleged victim, according to an
interpretation by Department of
Welfare attorneys.

The copy of the state police
complaint filed with Yorks said:
”Dr. Bartsch failed to report sus-
pected child abuse [of the girl] af-
ter learning of same from her and
her mother during a visit to his
office.” However, the words

”and her” have two lines through
them, making it read that the doc-
tor learned of the alleged abuse
from the girl's mother.

The complaint was received
that way, an assistant to the dis-
trict justice said. -Lisko said the
copy he received also had the
words lined out.

Hollidaysburg state police Sgt.
Thomas Semelsberger said noth-
ing was crossed out on the origi-
nal complaint.

Ragusea pointed to two issues.
”First of all, if Dr. Bartsch
talked to the mother and did not
talk to the daughter, he is under

«no obligation  to report child

abuse. If he talked to the girl and

"it occurred in the past tense, as

i read the law,'he is not under any
obligation to report [it],” Ragusea
said. ,

The 1975 law, amended in
1985 to include the beefed-up
reportingrequirements, refers to
professionals who have”reason
to believe  that a child coming
before them in their professional
or official capacity is a victim of
child abuse.”

dents.” Such projects needed to
create a condusive environment,
according to Daniel, are: a lec-‘
ture series, other special events
and places for minority students
to hold events.

Another area of need is that of
black faculty and administrators.

”There [are] just not enough
black faculty and administrators
at the university to assist in job
search and act as role models,”

said Daniel. ”We don't do
enough to retain minority
students.”

”|nstead, I have decided to re-
main here under the sametitle
and position with a major priori-
ty in improving black student
recruitment and retention,” he
said.

Austin suggested several other
actions that must be taken to help
increase black enrollment at Pitt.

”The affirmative action and
Civil Rights action of the '60s and
705 must be followed,” she said.
She also cited ”the need for par-
ents to be an intrical part of plan-
ning for secondary schooling.

Parents must influence students
to participate in college and par-
ents must be there to give the stu-
dents the push they need.”

Because black enrollment is
down, the major problems with
minority access to higher educa-
tion must beexplored. According
to Daniel, because the problem

‘is in many different areas, there

must be unity to solve it. ”The
problem is-very complex. There
must be many committed people
to resolve the minority student is-
sue,” he said.

By Susanne M. Schafer
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Congres-
sional investigators will question
the former personal secretary to
Lt. Col. Oliver North who report-
edly helped North destroy White
House records crucial to the Iran-
Contra probe, a member of the
Senate committee examining the
affair said Sunday.

The new report comes amid
denials by White House officials
that Chief of Staff Donald Regan

ter disputes with President Rea-

gan’s wife Nancy and criticism of
his handling of the lran affair.
’’I know of no such plans,”
White House spokesman Dan
Howard said.
_ Dismissing the reports as
rumors, Regan’s executive assis-
tant Thomas Dawson said, ’’I
don't believe they are true.”
Sen. George Mitchell (D-
Maine) a member of the Senate
select committee investigating

the secret sales of U.S. arms to
Iran, said his panel had planned -

to interview secretary Fawn Hall

even before The Washington Post

reported Sunday that she had

helped North shred documents.
TYTY

North's secretary to be questioned

”Obviously this is something
that the committee will look into
very carefully,” Mitchell said.

Hall, North's former secretary
at the~National Security Council,

' has been granted immunity from

prosecution by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and
has told investigators that she
helped North destroy documents
and internal messages in Novem-
ber, the Post reported.

The paper quoted a govern-
ment source as saying that the
statements from Hall and other
NSC aides, as well as the retrieval
of multiple computer communi-
cations, have established ”a clear

case of obstruction of justice.”
Repeated efforts to reach Hall
were unsuccessful, and her attor-
ney, Plato Cacheris, was out of
town.
”The congressional investigat-

ing committees are quite interest- .

ed in talking to her and will do
so at some point,” a source close
to the congressional investigation
told The Associated Press. ”She’s
someone worth talking to."

The source, who spoke on con-
dition he not be identified, said
the committees’ counsels had
been in touch with Hall through
her lawyer.

A White House source said
Hall now works on the Defense
Department.

The Tower board, headed by
former Sen. John Tower (R—Texas)
which has been investigating the
affair, is scheduled to submit its
report on Thursday to Reagan.

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater has said Rea-
gan’s aides expect ”a very criti-
cal and a very tough report.”

A spokeswoman for indepen-
dent counsel Walsh, Gail Alex-
ander, said there would be no
comment from the investigator
about the report that Hall said she
had spent about an hour on Nov.

But that 65—page report con-
cluded with a two—page list of un-
answered questions, including an
acknowledgement that the com-
mittee had not traced the money
trail from the purported diversion
of arms profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels. The congressional inves-
tigations now are in the hands of
select House and Senate com-
mittees.

asked to comment on the report,
said White House officials had no
knowledge of the Walsh's inves-
tigation, nor would they com-
ment on it.

”We just don't know-what
Walsh is doing and it would be
improper to say anything,”
Howard said. The spokesman
recalled that former White House
spokesman Larry Speakes had
said at one point that while some
shredded material had been
found by investigators, it was a
small amount.

North said Sunday, "I have told
consistently anybody that I've
ever worked with that they need
to do nothing to lie, to protect
anybody in this thing. Everybody
ought to tell the truth.”

Lady Panthers finally end losing streak

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

WHEW!

After 16 consecutive Big East
losses, the Lady Panther basket-
ball team beat the Lady Pirates of
Seton Hall Saturday night 77-71.

Pitt is currently ninth in the _

conference at-1-1 4, 7-19 overall.
Seton Hall remains eighth in the

' league while dropping to 3-12,

11.-15 overall.
Most likely, the teams will

’ meet again on Thursday night in

the first game of the Big East tour-
nament at Villanova. The winner

will face conference leader and

top-20 contender Villanova, on

Friday evening. ~
”Before the game, we decided

_ we. were going to win this one for

our two seniors —-and that's ex-
actly what we did,” said Pitt
coach Kirk Bruce.

For senior forwards Jane Plake

and Patricia Paul, the game was
their last in Fitzgerald Field
House. All that lies aheadis the
season finale at Providence this
evening an_d the Big East Cham-
pionships at Villanova this
weekend. ,

‘The team honored Plake, Paul

and center Pam Novosel (out be-
cause of an ankle injury) in the
traditional senior night.

’’I can't say that they [the ho-
noredseniors] were the sole rea-
son for our winning, but they
gave us added incentive,” Bruce
said of his seniors. '

While playing the entire 40
minutes, Plake» contributed 13
points and five rebounds, as Paul
played 25 minutes, scoring five
points and pulling down six re-
bounds. _

Although the seniors were get-
ting the credit, two freshman
guards played like seasoned

veterans.

Jen Shingler led the team in
scoring with 22 points, including
12 of 14 from the foul line. Point
guard Karen Threatt coupled with
Shingler for 12 assists and only
one turnover.

Both Shingler and junior for-
ward Sally Sheerer are ranked
among thetop five free-‘throw
shooters in the Big,East. Sheerer
hit nine of 10 free throws, fourlof
which were made during the fi-
nal minute. She finished the
game leading all rebounders with
12, as well as scoring 19 points.

The Lady Pirates had five play— .

ers in double figures.'Both for-
ward ‘Geraldine Saintilus and

guard Kathy O’Reilly scored 15,  A '

while reserve Sue Kupec added
-14, and Cheryl Greybush and

Debbie Hartnett scored 12 and _ "

11, respectively.
Pitt wasted no time getting on

top, leading by nine points 14-5.

at the 13:25 mark in the first half.
However, Seton Hall outscored
the Lady Panthers 15-1 over a

five-minute stretch latein the half.‘ V

Quick season, huh?

Polish up your vocal chords
and pop on your chapeaus, for
tonight's Pitt-Villanova game is
the last time you'll see the Pan-
thers basketball team live on-
stage at the field house. From
herein, it's ”On The Road
Again,” as Pitt travels to St.
John's, Madison Square
Garden for the Big East Tour--
nament, then wherever for the
NCAA tourney. _

But for now, concentration
is on the Wildcats —— a team
that Pitt fans love to hate.
Hecklers willbe coming out in
droves to see this one. That in-
famous Doug West scandal ig-
nited this mini-rivalry, and the
media threw some gasoline on
the fire. The result was a lot of
smoke and hot air.

Yet Panther coach . Paul
Evans is staying out of it.-”l
don't really believe there is a

_ rivalry. We treat it like any
other game. And with the me-
dia, I've just downplayed it.”

It seems there are other
more important things going
through the Panthers’ minds.

”This is a big game for us
because of the circum-
stances,” said Panther won-
derfrosh Rodney - Brookin.
”You know, we go down to
Georgetown and lose — we
can't afford to have mental let-
downs like that. If we are go-
ing to win the Big East, then
we've got to start playing like

a

we're capable of playing.”
Ah, the Georgetown game.
Had Pitt come away with a
win, their path to the regular
season titlewould have been
a lot clearer. That's twice this

‘And Rollie still has a pompous
air about him even though he
.hasn’t signed a bonafide high
school superstar since the days of
Eddie Pinckney and Harold
Pressley.

It has gotten so bad that Rollie
smokes cigars after games in
which his team loses. That
doesn't seem to make any sense.
A guy who puffs on a stogie after

‘ watching his team lose is far from

a genius. Maybe Rollie’s still
celebrating ’Nova’s 1985 NCAA
Championship. Maybe someone
should tell him that was two long
years ago.
, Rollie even makes fun of
sportswriters who‘ don't under-
stand his coaching decisions. Af-
ter Pitt beat the Wildcats, 58-57,
on Feb. 4, Rollie, puffing on a ci-
, gar, stood in front of a loudspeak-

_er and poked fun at the

Philadelphia writers who didn't
understand his last minute

strategy. .
The sad thing is that th
Philadelphia writers just laughed
even though the joke was on
them. Boy, some guy, that Rollie.
He makes fun of the Philly writers

and still has them laughing.

To top it all off, Rollie even has
the audacity to come to Pitts-
burgh thinking he can control the
student paper. After seeing The
Pitt News”’Five ways to rattle
Doug West,” Rollie cried foul to
the Pitt athletic administration
and Big East Commissioner Dave
Gavitt.

Can you believe it? Wherever
Rollie goes he wants things his
way. What a guy. Rollie’s the
kind of guy who would play a
game in Russia and expect to get
all the calls.

Villanova. So what's wrong with
that? Rollie’s a winner. He'll do
anything to get what he wants. If
he could only remember that
everyone’s not going to like him
as much as I do. V

Boy, I really like Rollie. l’m so
glad he persuaded Doug West to
go to Villanova. West had almost
committed to Pitt at one time, but
he ended up with Rollie.

If West had come to play for
the Panthers then Jerome Lane

would probably be playing else-’

where. You see, Pitt recruited
both players and, since West and
Lane played simliar positions in
high school, the Panthers would
only need the services of one of
the two. ..

So how can you get mad at Rol-
lie?’ He got a good player, but Pitt
got Lane. The Panthers got a su-
perstar, while the Wildcats got
just another small forward.

I'll have to thank Rollie for that
one the next time I see him.

I hope Panther fans don't
scream at Rollie too I much
tonight. Pitt doesn't wantto get
Rollie mad. He might pull his
team off the court and go home.

now, would we?
I guess we would rather see Pitt
build up an insurmountable lead

.and have Rollie pull his starters

out of the game, just like he did
at the field house in 1985. You
don't remember? Well the Pan-
thers were beating the Wildcats
by 30 points or so early in the se-
condihalf in front of a CBS tele-
vision audience, and Rollie got
upset. - ‘

He pulled his four best players
out of the game with 18 minutes
left.

Chipman got pretty upset, too.
It took a lotof the fun out of what
may have been his most satisfy-
ing win at Pitt.

But Chipman didn't under-
stand. Charles Smith was making
Pinckney look bad. Real bad.
Smith dogged Pinckney.

Rollie didn't like that because
Smith almost went to ‘Nova.

Rollie had to pull his starters.
He just had to. Nobody gets him-
mad and gets away with it.

I guess nobody will ever under-
stand. Just me and Rollie.

Boy, that Rollie, what a classy
guy. '

be a good loss if we can get past
Villanova and St. John's. _If we
don't, then obviously it's a bad
one.”

Guard Michael Goodson had a
similar view.-~"We’d been riding
high after we won all those
games in a row. That loss snaps
us out of it — it made us realize
‘Hey, we can still lose!’ I think
that game. really helped us more
than hurt us.”

Earlierthis month, Pitt traveled
eastward and met the Wildcats in
DuPont Arena. The Panthers
were lucky toget out of there
alive as they pulled out a tense
59-58 win. ”They really slowed
down the tempo last time,” Evans

. said. ”We’ve got to take control

this time."

Remember the last time we
played Syracuse (Feb. 9 at the
Civic Arena)? They were down
by a bunch in the second half,
then they just started running,
pushing the ball up the court
whether they had it or not," he
explained. "We're going to move
up the defense and try to speed
up the tempo —— make them get
into a running game with us. We
didn't do that last time.”

As tourney time draws nearer,
Pitt's lack of depth has become a
heavier and much more obvious
millstone. Georgetown’s frequent
substitutions and full-court pres-
sure wore the Panthers down.
And against UConn, center
Charlie Smith spent much of the
day on the bench in foul trouble.
Only a superhuman effort from
Jerome Lane saved that game.
But, Evans may have found him-
self a temporary solution;

Anyone remember Marlon Fer-
guson? The 6-8 fon/vard quietly
put on the redshirt last fall, but is
now back and ready to con-
tribute. -

"We were hoping to get him in
during the last game while we
were ahead," Evans remarked.
”Then things got tight. Tico was
in at the time, but he played bad-
ly —- something like one rebound
in the last seven minutes. We
probably should have played him
then. ’

‘ "He's been impressive in prac-
tice. I think he can help us. He's
ahelluva athlete.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 23, I987

Aiken may be halted by injury [

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

It seems bad luck has come
twice this year to at least one
senior star athlete directly before
his last game. ~-

During the. football season,
quarterback John Congemi was
lost to a back injury, preventing
him from going one last time
against arch-rival Penn State.
Now, during basketball season, a
concussion sustained during last
Wednesday's Georgetown game
may just cripple the plans of
guard Curtis Aiken tonight.

The shame of it is, this is his last
Pitt home game — ever.

”I really can't beleive I might
not play tonight,” said Aiken. ”It
really hurts when you think this
will be the last chance to play
here after four years, but I'll take
it as it comes.”

Aiken, who said he is suffering
from severe headaches, is not to-
tally sure of his medical status for
this evening.

”The doctors are warning me
that I shouldn't play, but I will
make the final decision. It real-
ly isn't easy going into senior
night as a senior and not being
able to play at least a little bit. But
one thing I don't want to do is
screw up my chances for playing

.in the next game [against St.

Johns], and I especially don't
want to be absent in the Big East
Tournament.”

But, in view of this new plight,

Aiken does not feel he really has
anything to be distressed about
concerning this season.

”I’m really [happier] this year
than I have been in the whole
time I've been playing for this
team,” he said. ”I think the emer-
gence of Coach Evans is one of
the best things that ever hap-
pened to our team here at Pitt. He
has brought experience and great
understanding with him, and he
has taught all of us the true mean-
ing of confidence.

”There is just no other way of
saying it — Coach Evans is a great
coach, and you have to give him
a lot of credit for coming in here
and doing the things he has.”

As well, his coach feels the
same about him.

”When I first met Curtis, I

' thought he would be a leader,

and my instincts were right,” said
Evans. ”He has constantly proved
to me that he is a player, and a
winning player at that. He has
never really given me any trou-
ble, and the best thing is [that] he

always tries his hardest at most_

anything.”

Aiken’s percentages this year
show proof of this determination
of which Evans speaks. He has
made a total of 414 points al-
ready, exemplifying his shooting
prowess, which was one of the
main reasons he was brought to
Pitt. This total also heightens him
to the third spot on the team point
list, directly under Charles Smith,
who has a total of 453, and Jer-

ome Lane, with 421.

”I am more than happy the
spotlight is not totally on me this
season,” he said. ”Sometimes
you can feel like a marked man
when you're out there and a lot
of different guys are on you all
the time. With other players out
there with me, I can take the
choice shots, and I don't have to
force any bad shots. It’_s a lot eas-
ier to do this now than when I al-
ways had four or five guys
directly in my face.”

But now, with the season
almost over and an unexpected
injury to battle, Aiken can only
reflect back on his memories.

’’I remember when I first came
here. I just wanted to play basket-

_ ball and learn a lot, and that is

basically what I've done. I have
a lot of very good memories, and
I hope that I have helped this new
group out as much as I could. But
they'll soon have their own good
memories, especially from this
season,” said Aiken.

Aiken himself said that this sea-
son has provided him with "his
own best memory.

”The best feeling of all was
when we had our 20th win
against Syracuse. I have never
been on a team that has gone as
far as this one, and it really felt
good to know that we were in the
No. I position after we had
worked so hard to try and get
there. And with the media hype
behind the game, it really meant
a lot to me,” Aiken continued.

McRae and team victorious 

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 23, 1937

at Big East Championships

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

Men's track coach John Vas-
vary brought a new weapon to
the 300-meter dash at the Big East
Track and Field Championships
in Syracuse in the form’ of high-
powered Lee McRae — his team
came away with a first-place fin-
ish in the meet this past weekend.

Vasvary gave McRae a lane in

_ the 300—meter dash — he came

back with a victory.

The 300-meter dash is not one
of McRae’s usual races, nonethe-
less he won. There was agood
reason for the change.

”We were trying to win every
race we could, as you can ima-
gine,” Vasvary said. ”We did get
five first places.” ‘

Pitt, in scoring 99 points to win,
had to hold off a few other Big
East powerhouses. Georgetown

Panthers wind. up the regular sea-
son at Providence. Earlier this
year, Providence desroyed Pitt
103-68.

”Whether or not we beat Provi-
dence isn't really that important.
lt’_s‘going to be tough, but our
girls learned tonight that they can
win if they want to," said Bruce.
’.’I think we've got the momen-
tumgoing into tournament time
that we've been trying to build.”

4

placed second with 97‘/2, and
Villanova a close third at 97.

McRae’s times were 6.35 at 55
meters and 33.99 in the 300.

Vernon Reed ran the same
races as McRae and‘ captured
sixth in the 55—meter dash with
6.53 and fourth in the 300 with
34.57. _ ‘

‘In the 55-meter hurdles, Pitt
dominated the event, capturing
four of the top five places.

Sophomore Eric Cannon took
first with a time of 736; Calvin
Holmes was second at 7.46; Ge-
orge Ifill finished third with a time
of 7.56, and Jason Harris placed
fifth with a time of 7.63.

In the 400-meter dash, Dave
Price finished in fifth placeat
49.13. Rowan Mighty crossed the
tape in sixth place at 49.26. This

timeenabled Mighty to qualify‘

for the lC4A. .

The next race, the 800-meter
run, was a turning point for the
Panthers. The meet was broken
into two days, so this race had a
good carry-over effect.

”This was the race that got us
mdmentum for the rest of the
meet,” added Vasvary.

Sophomore Dave Moore and
senior Tim Manes finished first
and second, respectively. Moore
was clocked at‘1:50.44, Manes at
1:51.24.

In long distance races, Bob.

Weiner was fourth in the
1000-meter run with 2:26.77;

fifth at 3:14.50.

Turning to field“ events, the

Panthers had two athletes with _

sixth’-place performances: Ifill in
the long jump (22-10 3/4), and
Tim Kulig in the shot put (41-1
1/4). ’ ’

After a big win like this, one
would wonder if any type of let-
down is possible. Coach Vasvary
doesn't think so.

”Every time you win, it's posi-
tive.-We’ll worry about others as
they come along. We beat some
great teams like Villanova and
Georgetown this week,” he said.

Pitt will have two weeks to pre-

' pare for the |C4A in Boston. This

race brings in some of the top
names in track and field. This will
give Pitt ample time to rest. And
they need it.

”There are a lot of -ti red people
after this race. It was a heck of a
lot of work,” Vasvary added.

Injury plagued gymnasts
suffer first lo

By Sharon _Haney
Staff Writer

injuries that have plagued the
Pitt gymnastics team all season fi-
nally caught up with the team as
the Panthers fell to defeat at the
hands of Michigan State this_past
weekend at Fitzgerald Field
House. '

The Panthers (6-1) suffered
their first defeat of the season
272.2 to 245.85. .

”Even _thOugh we lost, I'm [real-
ly] happy with our team,” said
head coach Frank D’Amico.
”Michigan was exceptionally

- strong today. They have more

depth than we do.”
D’Amico remained optimistic

~' ; _ about the progress and potential

of his team after the loss.
"’We have a" very young team,

‘ and our three freshmen are doing

very well,” he said. ”Pat Pollaci
had a damn good meet; Jorge

' ‘Gonzalez has been doing very

well; and Brock Freehling has
had some [really] good scores,
even though he's still injured.”

Junior Jorge Sanchez strained
his knee during the first event, the
floor exercise, and didn't com-
pete for the rest of the meet. Since
Freeh|ing’s ankle continued to
bother him, junior Rob Albrecht
filled in for him on the floor ex-
ercise. .

The men on the team are
equally optimistic and realistic
about the effect injuries have had
on the overall scores.

”Despite all of the injuries, we
did all right,” junior Steve
Powanda said. 1

”The scores would have been
closer if Sanchez hadn't been
hurt,” Freehling added.

The top performers for Pitt in»

the floor exercise were Sanchez,

Gonzalez and Pollaci. High
scores for the Panthers on the
pommel horse came from Gon-
zalez, Pollaci and Mike Mealie.

Dan Tarosky and Marty Comi-
ni were top scorers on the still

‘rings, while Gonzalez, Pollaci

and Freehling were the best on
the vault.

On the parallel bars,’ Powanda"

was the top Panther and scored

a personal best of 9.0, with Gon-
zalez finishing first for Pitt on the

high bar with a score of 9.2.

This weekend, the Panthers
will travel to Temple to take on
Southern Connecticut.

’’If we" pull together, we should
do well,” D’Amico said. ”With
what we have in the gym, we
have been getting maximum

production.” , '

Wrestlers lose meet ,

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

Pitt's All—America Pat Santoro
was set to wrestle last Saturday
against’ClariOn University's Mike
Cole. The match had a little twist
to it because Cole has been a

.thorn in Santoro’s side.

Last year they squared off four
times, with Cole winning three of
them. This time it was another
story. Santoro went out with fire
in his eyes and defeated Cole
10-3.

”This should start Paton a roll.
It was a great win and should gear
him up for the tournaments,” said
Pitt head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. A

The loss drops the Panthers to

11-4 overall and 2-4 in the

Eastern Wrestling League.
”Going in, I thought that 142

and 158 would be the key match-

ups,” Stottlemyer said. ’’If we

could get a few points from these .

matches, we could win the whole
thing.”

’’It was a really tough matchup
throughout,” said Stottlemyer. ’’It
was a real fans delight. They had

Men win bigand set new records

_ First place finisher in the 100m freestyle Scott leffries

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

For the fifth year in a row, the
Pitt men's swimming team has
captured the Big East Champion-
ship title.

Pitt completely dominated the
meet, winning with 856‘/2 points.
Villanova trailedbehind in sec-
ond place with 603 points.

_ Pitt's success was in part due to
the outstanding swimmer and
diver of the meet, junior Jim
Emore and senior Jack Shuten,
respectively. P

Emore won the 200-yard in-
dividual medley and took second
place in _the lOO—yard backstroke.
The event which got him the
most recognition though was the

’ lO0-yard, butterfly.

Emore, ‘ a returning Big East

ionships with a winning time of

49:01 in that event. .
Emore’s NCAA qualifying time
is even more fantastic if taken
into consideration the fact he had
been struck down with strep-

‘throat the week preceeding the

Big East Championships.
Men's swimming-"coach Fred
Lewis felt Emore’s bout with strep

throat had kept him from going .

even faster in the championship
meet. A

Emore shared the spotlight with
senior teammate Jack Shuten,
who was voted the most out-
standing diver of the meet.

Shuten captured first place in
the 3-meter divingvcompetition,
improving on his second—place
finish in last year's championship
meet. ' ' .

Although Shuten is pleased
with winning the 3-meter Big East
diving championship and being
named the most outstanding
diver, he still has goals he would
like to achieve before the season
is over. 0 _

’’I’m really glad I achieved
what I did in the meet,” said

' Shuten. ’’I worked hard for it, but

I haven't‘ accomplised all I've
wanted to accomplish this sea-
son, yet. l want to dive and place
well this year at the National Pre-
qualifying meet, and I also want
to make All-American status this
year.”

amongst fellow swimmers.

Freshman Charles Fry also
stood out in the Pitt line—up. Fry
dominated. the 1,650-yard free-
style, shattering the ;Big East
record and capturing first place.

Fry felt the 1,650-yard freestyle
was ”anyone’s race” and viewed
his teammate Rob Monte as his
biggest competition.

’’I wasvery pleased with win-
ning a first place at the Big East
Championships,” said Fry. ’’I

knew that no matter who took.

first place in the event that their
time would break the record.
Really it was anyone’s race, espe-
cially since Rob"‘Monte and I have
been ?back and forth all year
long.”

"Fry's teammate, sophomore

_Scott\Jeffries, also had a good

championship meet contributing
a first—place finish and Big East
record breaking time in the
100—yard freestyle, as well as a
third—p|ace finish in the 50-yard
freestyle. ' 1’

It is curious to note thatjeffrie
a returning Big-East Champion in
the 50-yard freestyle, never con-
sidered himself "able to swim a
longer race such as the lOO—yard
freestyle. ,

’’I never thought l could swim
the 100-yard freestyle well since
it was a longer race than l was
used to,” said Jeffries. ”l actually
used to dread swimming it. But
breaking a Big East record in that
event, though, gives me consider-
ably more confidence in swim-
ming it.”

Other first—place contributors to
the Panther effort were freshman
Tim Adams, with a win in the
100-yard backstroke, and his
teammate sophomore Mark

Women provide NCAA’s with  _______  

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's.’ swimming
team not only captured their fifth
straight Big East Championship

this past weekend, but they also -

qualified the largest contingent of
swimmers for the NCAA Cham-
pionships this year.

The Pitt women's swimming
team qualified senior Sue Hick-
man in the 50-yard freestyle,
freshman Sandy Albright in the
100-yard backstroke as well as in
the 200-yard medley relay team,
the 800-yard free relay team and
the 200-yard free relay team.

Almost everything that Hick-
man and her teammate Albright
touched turned to gold at the Big
East Championships, including
being honored as outstanding
swimmers of the meet. '

Albright and Hickman, along
with teammates freshman Laure
Walczak and senior O'Neil cap-
tured first place with their win-
ning 200-yard medley relay team
as well as setting a meet record
and going five-tenths under the
NCAA qualifying time.

Next, Albright had an outstand:
ing race in the 100-yard back-
stroke, capturing first place. Her
time of 57:88 not only qualified
her for the_NCAA Championships
but also broke Big East ‘and
school records. She also took first
place in the 200-yard backstroke.

The two teamed up together
again on the 400-yard medley re:
lay team with.O’Neil and fresh-
man Pam Murphy to place first at
the Big East Championships as
well as qualifying for the NCAAS.

Hickman also had a role in the
success of the 200-yard free relay
team. Along with teammates
Walczak, junior Cindy Rose and
senior Tracy Pfister, they shat-
tered the school record and quali-
fied for the NCAA Champion-
ships with their first placefinish.

Pitt women's swimming coach
David Belowich, who was

V named coach of the year by his

peers, was pleased V with the
swimmers’ performances.

”We set out with the goal that
everyone was to aim to do their
best and, as it turned out, every-
one did,” said Belowich. ”A large
percent of the swimmers enjoyed
life-best times in their events. It
