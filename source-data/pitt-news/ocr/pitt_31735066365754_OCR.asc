“I hope to move you tothe
left,” .Dr. Benjamin Spock
said. “In doing so, I will tell
you how and why,‘ I, was
yanked and pushed,» to the
left. Perhaps, you can tell by
my clothes that I was not
born a radical.”

"In an address delivered Thurs-
day _to a‘ large audience here."
Spock.“ the People's Party candi-
date for President. revealed his
motives for actively participat-
ing in a third party movement.

Spock cited industrialization.
pollution. poor medical care. and
the "power grab" in Vietnam as
factors which influenced his
mildly liberal Democratic stance.

He described’ the main pur-
pose of the party’s movement as
“an attempt to help people gain ~
control over those institutions
which control them.”

"United States citizens." he
continued. "are n_ot like insig-
nificant grains of sand. People
must be able to go to the police.
the schools. and the clinics and
be respected."

'These existing factors of life
in America. Spock said. have
forced him to realize’ the need
for the construction of a new
political_party. "We htust take

tency of_the band director end-
ed in apparent deadlock yester-
day.

After an hour‘ clash with ad-
ministrators, 320 band members
maintained that." Band director
Edmund Williams is not quali-.
fied to direct the group, though
administration spokesmen said
a" review of -the charges and Wil-
laims’ qualifications proved" him
a highly qualified musician. '

Lynn Alstadt. spokesman for
the dissatisfied bandsmen. who
he estimated comprise 75 per '
cent of the 120-member march-
ing band,said they have leveled
twotcharges against Williams:

—He ‘'doesn‘t have the profes-
sional abi'lity. and experience
needed to lead a band of this
size.“and_ V 0

—-—‘‘He does not possess the
leadership or administrative"
abilities to properl.y run; the
band.“ ‘i '

“a haphazard selection proce_ss”
in ch_oosing Williams.

Dr. ‘David Powers, Assistant to
the Chancellor; Said that Snow
and Dr. Jerome Rosenberg. Dean
of the Faculty of Arts andvSci-

T ences had concluded the charges

were unjustified. Their decision
had been accepted by Provost
Rhoten Smith who is ultimately
responsible for adacemic person-
nel. “ '

According to Powers. Chance-‘
lor Posvar is satisfied with the
decision and_no further review
will take place. V

Rosenberg said as the meeting ,
opened that the basic problem 4'

was that Williams, in his first
year at Pitt, and the bandsmen
simply have not had time to
adjust toone another.

He also saidi'that two recent
‘policies regarding the band may
have been sources of tension:
jurisdiction for the band was
transferred ‘ from the g Office of

Student«_Affairs to the Faculty

7

The band . further contends, ’

«Alstadt said, that an incompet-

ent director was hired because-

, chairman of the Music Depart

inent Dr. Robert Snow had used

student radicalization

‘ ‘ advantage of the focus of the'72

elections to inspire people to

'start at the grass roots. Local

government must be made more
important than state, government
andstate government more pow-
erful than the national.“

The‘ coalition of progressive

third parties which the 69-year-

old candidate represents is an
outgrowth of a convention held
during
in Texas. The coalition
common ground for radical new
alternatives. The candidates cho-
sen for the 1972 Presidential
election .were Spock. famous for
his influence on the rearing of
children from.1930 to 1950. and’
Julius Hobson. a black educator
in Washington. D.C. I

-The thrust of their movement,
says the Peoples Party,- is not

‘solely to elect the candidates

but -to form a viable political
force. ‘The party is circulating a
to get a permanent
place on the ballot. 36,000 sig-
natures of qualified electors are
needed. '

Spock outlined the major planks
of the Peoples Party for the 1972
election. . He anticipates that
the party will concentrate on a
wide range of problems in their
campaign:

-the immediate withdrawal of
forces not onl_v in Vietnam but
throughout the world;

—speedy disarmament:

-—provisions for the poverty-
stricken. Specifically, a minimal
amount of $6,500 for every fam-
ily of four and, in the long-run,
agood job;

——free medical care:
-—-changes in the enforcement of
15acismlaws:‘ .' ' -

the Thanksgiving holi-

.—prohibition of sexism with_

free day-care centers;

—an end _to discrimination a-

gainst h'omosexua.ls; . H ‘A ~

fits with industry.broken down,

into local components; g

——a ‘voucher system of educa-
uon;and = _

—local control of schools with
"a provision that-' barriers to
housing be eliminated.

Spock added that the party
had written an explicit. plank
reading: ".‘All laws making
crimes for which there is: no vic-
tim must be repealed.” This
plank refers, said Spock, to the
present marijuana penalties. '

i,Allocations-i Committee

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

 j;. The Student Government Board appointed the seven members of
‘a—new Allocations Committee and one alternate member at a meeting

:, ___Tue§'‘day night.
 The seven Allocations Committee members for the upcoming
‘J -.year"are Jeff Pierce, Jeff Pasek, Jerome Peters, Pat Kablach, Al Ma-

ltecko, Donald Sherman, and Joan Poellnitz. The alternate is Gerry

 Velrriéi. I

The seven appointees were recommended by a selections com-
mittee of three SG members. which reviewed all Allocations Commit-

‘ tee applications. . ’  -

-Out of 31 applicants, the committee selected 14 and further recom-
mended seven of these to the Board.

' Selection was based on a review"of a budgetand a proposedmock
"budget of each applicant’s design. Selection was based onefficiency in

 V the proposed budget, applicants’ ideas, and the time expenditures they
_were w_il'ling to make. . r ‘ ' v

.i,.
,.

 

Upon presentation of the recommended seven by the selection com-

mittee, Board member Walt Wills made a motion thatthe Board accept

' the proposals of the committee unanimously. —- .

Other ‘Board members disagreed and argued that a summary of all

- seven was needed.

After a brief’ sketch of the seven recommended. President Tom
Bailey requested that they cover the other seven candidates also.

Following the discussion, the Board voted on all 14, finally arriving

5, at the seven originally recommended by theselection committee.
, ‘A Discussion turned to the Allocations Board by-laws which weige

 tetntatively accepted unless a conflict should arisewith the; SG by-laws

' V _ not yet drawn up. »

Parliamentarian Paul Symczak presented some of the questions of

A‘-the new by-laws to the'Board—offical name of the organization, the pur— -
- pose of the Board, and recognition of standing comamittees. —

', j - The by-laws that are "operational, not jurisdictional” should have

the “maximum input from the Student Government Board," according
to Symczak. . ‘ , V

Symczak agreed upon “urging” from the Board to have the by-laws

completed and ready for approval by the end of March. _
In other business, selection of chairman of the Homecoming Com-

mittee is being set up; interviews began Wednesday.
The Board considered early selection of the Homecoming Commit-

' tee necessary to assure a good program.

Female wages dip comparatively

Younger women are just recently starting out

Provost issues directive

by LOIS LEVINSON

In spite of the development of the women‘s lib-
eration movement and passage of civil rights legis-
lation banning pay discrimination by sex, the imbal-
ance in wages between American men and women
has increased in the last 15 years, according’to a
recent report of the Department of Labor. ‘

The report indicated that the 1955 median wage
of a working woman was nearly 64 per cent of that
of her male counterpart. whereas in 1970. her earn-
ings dipped to 59.4 per cent of a mans salary.

The median earnings of full-time male work-
ers in 1970 was $8.966, according to the study, while
womeris‘ medianwage was $5,323. ‘‘ a

en don’t fill plumbing, draftsmen, and machinists
jobs where they could earn higher wages.

Jan Feagans, associate director for Affirma-
tive Action at Pitt. attributed the lower female me-
dian wage in part to the weakness of agencies sup-
posed to promote equal pay.

“These agencies can gather all the statistics
they want," she said, "but they have no legal clout
with which to implement them."

for women, has no regulatory power and relies on

the Office of Federal Contract Compliance for en-

Feagans said that the efficacy of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW),
which can‘ legally prosecute discriminators is hin-
dered by a manpower shortage.

_ “It (HEW) hasn’t been overwhelmingly effec-
_ tive," she said, “because they are extremely under-
staffed. They have a core staff of 17 to handle 2000
schools. 6000 hospitals, and numerous social agen-
cies." _a
_ Pitt was one of 11 colleges whose funds were
held up by HEW in 1971 for failure to comply with a
federalvorder forbidding sex discrimination. HEW
later cleared Pitt on seven of nine charges of sex
discrimination, forcing the University to make
restitution in the other two cases.

Gayhteachercontests dismissal  R0

UNIVERSITY PARK, PA. (AP)~A plaintiff in a
suit charging Pennsylvania State University with
discrimination against homosexuals Tuesday was
relieved of his student teaching duties at a State
College Area junior high school.

“I’m sure it’s related to my involvement in
the HOPS (Homophi1es of Penn State) case,” said
Joe Acanfora, 21, of Brick Town, N.J.

Acanfora, who expects to graduate in June
with a secondary education degree, said he was in-
formed by A. Madison Brewer, associate dean of
college education at Penn State that the high
school did not want him to complete his student
teaching.

“When I asked why, they, Brewer and George
Weigand, coordinator for student teaching at the
high school said an official statement would
come from the school board's attorney,” Acanfor
said. . A

At a press conference Tuesday night, John Mill-
er, soliciterfor the State College Area School Dis-
trict, gaidz » -

 was the consensus of opinion that the, uni-
versity should be requested to recall Joseph Acan-
fora from his assignment as a student teacher in
the Park Forest Junior High School. .

 and get along with my students.

“The publically announced objectives of the
organization of which Joseph Acanfora is a mem-
ber are not compatible with the educational poli-
cies of the public school.” '

Miller also said that “the administration is
responsible for the conduct of schools and for the
policies and procedures recognized by society to-
day.” . A a

He said heterosexual, rather than homosexual ..
behavior, is accepted by society.

HOPS filed the suit in the Common Pleas
Court of Centre County Saturday to obtain a SI.I.I‘>"
dent activity charter, and -Acanfora, who admits he’
is a homosexual member of the group—it also in-
cludes “straights” or non-homosexuals—said the
high school has no basis for forcing him out.

“My outside activities in no way affect the
quality of my teaching,” he said. “I’ve received
good ratings from the people I work with and _for,
and I’m doing very satisfactory in my classroom

"‘I feel I am completely and totally in the right,
morally, socially, legally and constitutionally.” '

Acanfora said he agreed to be a plaintiff in
the HOPS suit because the group "is educational
in nature’? and that “homosexuality is not a sick-
ness or abnormality.” \

Commissiori 4 suggests .

relaxed spot penalties

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN A
The National Commission on

Marijuana and Drug Abuse, after,

intensive study of commissioned
reports and testimonies, has un-
animously decided to recommend
a relaxation of ‘the present strin-
gent penalties for the private pos-
session and use of marijuana.

A New York Times report
stated that the committee’s re-
commendation to Congress _and
President Nixon did not consti-
tute a proposal for full legaliza-
tion of the drug. Instead, the
year-long study resulted in a de-
cision that is tantamount -to a
“virtual decri.minalization” of
the private use of marijuana.

The existing criminal penalties
for- the sale of the drug, its cul-
tivation, transportation or public
smoking are said to be favored
by the committee.

The commission correlated the
present stiff penalties for disre-
gard of marijuana laws with the
millions of Americans who ille-
gally drank alcohol before the
elimination of Prohibition.

Another consideration of the
committee was the affects of the
harsh penalties on society and the
degree to which they might sur-

pass the theorized dangers of ma--

 

rijuana legalization.

Some of the major points on
which the recommendation is
based were the lack of evidence
that: '

'—~ Marijuana
physically or
harmful;

~— The drug leads to usage of
hard drugs; '

— Usage of marijuana leads to
crime;

is addictive or
psychologically

— There‘ are any beneficial
aspects to date.

While the report awaits finali-

zation and release in March, cri-
tics ‘are assessing the work of the
committee .as an open-minded
effort. On May 2, 1971, tough,
President Nixon said that he would

not follow the recommendation.

of the commission if the conclu-
sion amounted to legalization.

, The commission worked with
groups of high school and college

students as well as doctors, law-_

yers, and teachers who had ex-
perience using the drug.

One case study suggested that
marijuana was "more widely used
and accepted than formerly rea-
lized and that perhaps 24 mil-
lion Americans had used mari-

Forum from printing the document last week, revoked the injunction
'-“against. publication Tuesday. but only after the plaintiffs in the case
i.withdrew‘their objections to the printing. v «‘ " .

 As reported in Wednesday’s Pitt News, Judge_Wentley refrained

solution outside the court.

I

 gf Under‘ the terms of an agreement reached 'by the Forum and the
.:plaintiffs, heirs of the late Dr. Edward Litchfield, former Chancellor
-‘,_('_if.’_the‘University, the Forum has published the “Litchfield Papers” and
‘has “prominently displayed” a statement by the Litchfield family
{in the same issue. ' ' -
 -Considering the highly, controversial nature of the document, the
_agreement is fair and proper. — '

1' A Written by William Rodd. the "Litchfield Papers" were never for-
.“ mally_ approved by Dr. Litchfield, and may very well have contained
 statements and stylistic flourishes which Litchfield f,o,u‘nd objection-
fiiable. 7 H ‘ ‘
 Thus, it is appropriate for the Litchfield heirs to express their
 viewsof the document in the issue of the Forum containing the docu-
I ment itself. . \

L However, though this scheme is an excellent idea, there is no rea-
2-_"7son why it should be mandatory. Such an arrangement, should have
 :been worked out by the Forum and.the Litchfield heirs without the in-
 tercession of the Court of Common Pleas. I »

I‘ The very idea of “prior restraint” is repugnant to those who'be-
_ live in freedom of the press, and it is an unacceptable way of dealing
’ with printed information that maybe misleading or even libelous.

In the recent Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court rejected
the US.’ Government’s petition for "prior restraint" as "unconstitu-
 tional. " '
3 J»  Because Rodd‘s ownership of the document was in question, the
 f "Litchfield Pape’rs“ case involves nuances which the Pentagon Papers
 , case did not. , ‘ l . .
 _. . According to Rodd. the document belonged to him; according to
1'  ..the Litchfield family, it did not. ' g _ -

" tj --Unfortunately, the question of Rodd's ownership was never re-
: ~ solved, so the basis for Judge Wentley‘s injunction has not been tested.

   
   
 
 

-, Despite this uncertainty, however, the spirit of Wentley’s injunc-
, ' tion runs against the grain of the First Amendment-. _ .
f. I As Judge Murray Gurfein wrote in the Pentagon Papers case, "A
f cantankerous press, an obstinate press, an ubiquitous press must be
_*  suffered . . . in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of V
expression and the right of the people to know.” ,,

The solution reachedby the parties in the "Litchfield Papers“ dis-
‘ _pute was equitable and laudable.

But the court‘s role in the decision augurs ill for the future of a
free press. -

by DEBBRA DUNCAN:

Four of the dozen Democratic
candidates for the Presidency will

Hampshire primary with a write-
in campaign for a fifth. Senator
Edmund Muskie of Maine is the

fron_t runner. He is being _chal- .

lenged by Senator George McGov-

v'ern of South Dakota‘, Mayor of Los

Angeles Sam Yorty. Senator
Vance Hartke of Indiana. and
write-in candidate Wilbur Mills.

5 congressman from Arkansas.

L Humphrey, Jackson, Lindsay.
and Wallace have chosen to avoid
New Hampshire for Florida,
where Muskie will be farther
fromvlvlaine. Chisholm also will be

. there.

The real test, then, is Muskie’s
strength.

Traditionally, New Hampshire
is a trendsetter. if only because
it is the first primary. It is here

steamroller or may lose a prema-
ture image of strength.

elusive. in which e se everyone
claims victory, and waits for the
next primary. ‘In any event, the
Florida candidates are sure to
be cheering for the underdogs in
New Hampshire. .
ELECTORATE’S SIZE
A problem for any candidate in
the New..Ham'pshire primary is
the size of the electorate. There

are an estimated 100,000’ regis-
tered Democrats. 160,000 regis-

tered Republicans, ‘and 140,000
independents. As one Muskie sup-
porter has said: “The total Demo-
cratic vote is so small that any-
one who can get a thousand votes
becomes a factor—it all depends

.on how it addsup." A

‘Thus. the more candidates. the
less chance Muskie has ofpulling
more than 50 per cent of the vote.
Collectively. Muskie’s challeng-
ers,‘ just by being in New Hamp-

shire, decrease Muskie"s chances,
for a strong showing. But that _.

does ,.not necessarily help their
own individual chances.

INDEPENDENT VOTE
An important factor in the New
Hampshire primary is" the inde-

 l7ake fire calls endanger lives

 ,  An open letter to resident students:

 I’ When I first came to this University, I had the
;’f' notion that this was the place where you finally ma-
 tured into:-the adult who would then enter. society
' and take his rightful place. Now, I know I was

wrong; as I have been about many other precon-
 ceived notions about college life.

, It has been my experience at Pitt to see.some
of the most childish behavior I have yet to witness. ‘
' Letime cite some examples:

, j _ Ithas been my past experience to know of many

 '.‘,‘young” people that have turned in false fire
alarms. I never would have believed this prank
would be so popular among college students.

But there must be some point where pranks are

no longer jokes. When it comes down to putting

_' other people's lives in danger, itis no longer a joke

and the prankster needs to be stopped. I thought col-

lege students had more sense and more responsi-

bility. Many have none, as can be substantiated by
the number of false alarms this alone.

I cannot recall how many times I have been

told the story of the boy who cried wolf. I guess

= some Pitt students have forgotten that story. It’s

‘useless to explain all the harm and danger involved

in turning in a false fire alarm. We have heard that
story all through grade school,

, This might be interesting to residents—the Fire
Department no longer sends its fire engines to an-

N J, swer alarms from the University, but instead
_  sends a car to check if the report is for real. Ifthere

" were ever a fire, it would take the fire engines twice

 - _ as long to reach the dorms.

 Then, of course, there is the blatant misuseof

ed by residents for play purposes. These same peo-
ple may someday wonder where the extinguishers
are when their room is inflamed. Maybe some _

with an extinguisher that will someday save their

The residents of Tower A from the ninth floor
on down would be glad to tell-anyone how_much fun
it is to flood out a building. It’s so much fun to see a
person's belongings floating around hisroom, orhis
‘stereo submerged under several inches of water.
Cleaning up afterwards is thrilling: too. This inci-.
dent showed how concerned some college students
are about the rights of others. ‘

Another questional friend is the elevator op-
erator. This courteous fellow stops an elevator be-
tween floors so that the Campus Police can have the
fun, of fishing him out. We all know how much of an
emergency it is when the elevator will not stop on
your floor and you have to walk a flight of steps.

After all, the real fun starts when the eleva-
tors don't work at all, and you have to walk up
maybe 20 flights of stairs. I mean that has to be a
real good joke. Ask anyone who has had to walk up
that many flights. '

If you’re really interested, ask the Housing

pendent vote. What makes the in-
dependent vote relevant in New
Hampshire where it would make
no difference in Pennsylvania is

the fact that independents can.

vote in the primary. Totalling as
muchas 140,000 votes of a total
400,000 registered voters, it is
certainly a large potential vote.

Unfortunately for George Mc-
Govern and Congressman Paul
McCloskey of California, who is
challenging Richard Nixon for the
Republican vote, independents
can vote in only one primary.
Ironically, these two candidates
who are allies in‘ opposing Nix-
on’s policies must fight each
other for the independent vote.

New York Times writer Bill ~

Kovach contents “most of those
,,registered independents are. long-.
time residents of the. state who

traditionally take no part in party

    

Or the results Cogldbe incon-if primaries and are‘ expected to

stay out of this year’s voting.”
However," most of the newly en-
franchised 18-year-old
have been registering indepen-
debt. It is here. McGovern and

McCloskey are centering their -

campaigns.

' McCloskey has argued that
"meaningful competition is not. in
the Democratic primary, but in

, the Republican primary, which
offers a direct vote against the

President’s war policy.’‘' In an
appeal to students on the campus»
of St. Anselm’s College in Man-
chester last week, a campaigner
for McCloskey said: "I‘m con-

'vinced a_ strong showing by him
here on March 7 could end the war ‘

this year." If the McC-loskey
forces can. convince young people
this is where they can make the
biggest impression, many may
drop the liberal Democratic cause
to‘ make a direct statement
against Nixon.

NEWSPAPEIPS WEIGHT

Another factor which no can I
I . der who seems to have any chance

ignore is the power of the press.

. William Loeb, publisher of the

Manchester Union-Leader, is
swinging all his influence behind
conservative Sam Yorty. The’
state’s largest paper has con-
sistently run‘ anti-Muskie articles,

 and pro,-Yorty stories on the front
_ page. .

He calls Muskie “flip-flop Mus-

’ kie, the Vietnam war hawk-dove-

chicken” and “Moscow Muskie.”

I Muskie counters, “If there is
anything alien to New Hampshire
and Maine in this campaign, it

'isn't Ed Muskie, it’s the Man-

chester Leader.” Many contend
that what percentage Yorty gets
in the primary is only a ‘measure
of Loeb’»s power which may be as
much as 15-20 per cent.

. INCOME TAX

New Hampshire is the only state
without an’ income or salestax.
The issue is a frequent problem
to the state government and is
threatening to become an issue in
the national race. As much as any
candidate would like to remain si-

voters '

 

 First primary   tests /\/Iuskie

lent on local issues. it hasalready
had some, effect. Congressman
Mills went to New Hampshire es-
pecially to speak for an income
tax. where he previously had not
planned to appear before the pri-
mary.

Yorty has already said that if’
one looks to the McGovern and
Muskie slates of delegates. he
will find the pro-income tax sup-
porters. He is trying to align him-
self with the entrenched state op-
position to broad-based tax. As
large a part economics plays in
today‘s politics, the issue could
become important.

MUSKIE SPREAD THIN

Muskie is one of 12 contenders
running in nearly all of the 23 pri-
maries. Wherever he-‘goes,’ he is

faced with the problem of candi— ..

dates being there and remaining
there long after he -leaves. He is

9. as

quoted on Feb.
"We’re spread so thin over the 50
states its a miracle we hold to-
gether.“

saying,

Obviously. he is at a tremendous
disadvantage, where other candi-
dates can concentrate on two or,
three specific states. ‘

' CONCLUSION

‘If other Democratic contenders
can gather more than 50 per cent
of the vote, Muskie will .not
emerge with the strongfront run-
her image. To convince his pub-.
lic he can make it to the Conven-
tion, he must show strongly some-

\ where early.

With'Wallace expected to win
Florida and Lindsay and McGov-
ern to show well in Wisconsin,

Rhode Island. ‘and’ Massachu-

setts, Tom Wicker contends a
weak showing in New Hampshire
could mean that only in Illinois

' of the early primaries will Mus-

kie have the chance to prove his
strength. . ‘

McGovern is the only conten-

of proving his own strength by a
low Muskie count. He has the best
organization of any of the candi-
dates and has demonstrated
greater strength than the polls
have predicted as shown in the
Iowa and Arizona caucuses.

Mills is entering New Hamp-
shire solely to diminsh Muskie’s
image as front runner. Yorty may
fare well under the shelter of Mr.
Loeb, but nowhere else -will he
receive such royal coverage.
Hartke is very rarely taken as a
serious candidate. ~

Several situations may arise I
from New. Hampshire." 'Muskiev
may look like a front runner, build
his momentum and make it to the

Convention. He may look only fair

and lose momentum. .

In which case a new challenger’ , Q 
could conceivably 1 move up. Or
I the Democratic Party could re-
main divided, in which case Ted
Kennedy will get the call at Mia-
mi. A lot depends on New Hamp-
shire, though not all. '

of bone fractures in horses, which may make it
possible to mend human bone fractures within a
month’s‘time, has been developed by a Pitt pro-
fessor.

The still unnamed method, developed by As-
sistant professor of chemistry, Dr. Dwight W.
Chasar at Pitt’s Johnstown campus, involves in-
jecting a solution containing several chemical
compounds into the fracture and results‘ in per-
fect bone mending within five or six weeks.

Observable mending begins within a week

of the first injection. Following another injec-
tion in the next three to four weeks, X-rays show

, no evidence of a fracture ever having existed.

After a year, the horse, which otherwise would
have been shot, is running races. All of this is ac-
complished without casts, splints, nails, or pins.

All previously-used solutions took from 10-12
weeks for’ healing and often produced adverse
side effects. a

The possibility of using this injectable solu-
tion on humans is still under investigation. “We
have not used the technique on humans for legal
reasons,” explained Chasar. “However, ‘since hu-
man bone structure is relatively similar to that
in animals, it is not inconceivable that the pro-
cedure could be applied to human bone fractures.”

Chasar said that this technique would "un-
deniably revolutionize the medical procedures of
bone mending. A limb could be back in ‘use. un-
hindered by c_asts or splints, in a months time," he
said.

. Chasar sees the next step as possible treat-

ers, skiers, etc.

 for March ’ weekend 6 

“If the solution can mend a bone in a horse’s
leg and the leg can withstand the shock of a
horse's 2,000 pounds without refracturing, then
the technique could work for athletes who return
to the football field or to the ski slopes."

Chasar became involved in the development
of the solution in July, 1971. Glenhaven Farms .
an independent horse farm_was willing to sup-
port the research and contacted him requesting
that he further develop a chemical solution that
would mend bone t_'ractures without side effects.

“Much to our surprise,?’ said Chasar, “within
a short period of time, we developed a solution
which can be made from commercially available
chemicals and produces astounding results.”

The biochemistry behind the process is com-
plex. A bone which is deformed, or put under
stress generates an electric current. When the
bone breaks. the ends become negatively charged.
It has been shown that a negative electrode from
an electrical source, when placed in the bone.
causes bone growthiin the area around the elec-
trode.'

Chasar indicates that this method—using the
new solution—does the same thing. only without
the use of an electrode.

"Our thesis,” he said, “is that the injected
solution generates its own battery or electrical
charge within the fracture site. allowing the
fibers of the bone to reunite perfectly."

The new solution, has been used successfully
to treat at least 15 horses

Contrary to expectations, the
stipends offered next year's Resi-
dent Assistants and Unit Lead-
érs did not escalate the number
of applicants for these positions.

This year, 310 students filed
applications, in comparison to
487 who applied last year.

2 The decline has been attribu-
ted in part to the nature of this
year’s application.

"The application, said _ John
Vrana. Director of Housing,
"was longer than its precedents,
more involved, and required more
time and thought.“

"In the event that a good inter-
viewing process could not have
been devised? he added. “the ap-
plication would te-ll us more
about the student."

The upcoming selection will
be based on a committee de-
cision, with two people respon-
sible for the final selection: Judy
DiMattia, Coordinator of Resi-
dence Hall Personnel, and J0-
anne Woodson, assistant Director
ofHousing.

According to DiMattia and
Woodson, the interviewing pro-
cess will involve several steps.
The group interview will con-
sist of a maximum of seven
applicants. It will be conducted
by two persons, one of whom
will be either DiMattia, Wood-
son, or one of the three current
Head Residents, with the other
to be drawn from a pool of de-
parting Resident Applicants.

"A certain loose structured
process will be employed to
assess the peoples’ personal

qualities and their ability to re-
late to others in a group,” said
DiMattia.

The interview will terminate
with each interviewer individually
assessing the candidates.

Before the elimination, Wood-
son, who is black, will1indivi-
dually interview all black can-
didates, to eliminate possible

' feelings of alienation.

The first elimination will take

place around the second week in»-
.March. It will be based equally

on the group interviews, the
application responses, and re-
commendations. "One strength
of the process,” said DiMantia,
iris that one fantastic or one bad

Pleasing “color games’
enliven Gilliam show

by J. CLINTON KOHBERGER

The stretched and unstretched canvasses of Sam Gilliam made
their Pittsburgh debut last week at the Kingpitcher Gallery for
Contemporary Art at 303 S. Craig St. ‘ .

Gilliam is a skilled artist; he is a painter. craftsman. color the-
orist. and environmental artist, Provocative and pleasing, his canvas-
ses stretched onto beveled stretchers are fascinating color games.

In “jNat.:ural,” themost exciting of his stretched works on dis-

' play, Gilliam uses color as his medium for communication. Large

areas of color merge and flow throughout the six-foot square paint-~

‘ ing. Crystalline images surface in one corner of the canvas and li-

quid forms run into another. -
Gilliam defines planes b_y allowing one color to advance and an-

I other to recede. His control of color is such that one even feels a

temperature change within the painting. .

Quite popular with the preview crowd. the painting seems‘ al-
most a game to discover new forms and movement within the can-
vas. .

Also outstanding are two 13" .x 100“ canvasses in "Gallery A.
“For" and ‘Nimba." Though two separate paintings. they function
well as one work. They are exercises in subtlety, and Gilliam again
uses color to achieve the effect.

“Sticks” is Gilliam’s most overwhelming piece. A mammoth,
comic, lumbering work, it is an unstretched canvas draped over
and around huge floor-to-ceiling poles. It is an environmental art
sculpture and should be‘ seen many times.

It grows, folds, turns, and literally envelopes the viewer. (You

can walk beneath part of "'Sticks" and get the view from under-
neath). The polished wood floors of the gallery become part of this .

piece, as do the white walls and even the lights.

The Kingpitcher Gallery will display Gillia-m’s works for the «

next three weeks. Its hours are l1a.m. - 4 p.m., Tuesday-Saturday.

  Swimmers face
uphill struggle

by STEVEN WILLIAMS

"If we beat Syracuse, it’ll be our season.” stated freshman sprin-
ter Tom Smith. looking forward to the homecontest with Syracuse .‘to;-

morrow afternoonat 2 p.in.

It Will be the _.fiI'St time in two weeks. 8 Span Covering the eXhibi- anllllllllllllllIIIIIIIllIIIIllIIllIllllllllllllllllllllllllll

tion meet at Grove City and last weeks open date. that the
team will be competing. _ '-

“Syracuse," according to Coach Richard Bradshaw.
"is favored to win the Big Four meet in two weeks.” This
is indicative of the Orangemen’s strength and depth.
They are fresh from a 67-46 victory over Bucknell Uni-
versity, who defeated the mermen earlier this season.

Syracuse will invade Trees Hall led by Brian Krause,
Jim Steifel, and Mike Toth, all contenders for, or at pre-
sent, Eastern champions.

Brian Krause, an Eastern champion who holds the

Pitt Pool record in the 1,000. has improved that time of '

10:05 already this season. He is undefeated in every event
he has swum. In fact one of the tricky moves employed
by the. Syracuse coach in defeating Bucknell was inserting
Krause in the 200 yd. freestyle eventagainst NCAA All-
American Peter O‘Keefe.

, In the close contest Krause emerged theivictor with
an outstanding 1:48.1 clocking. better than any time a Pitt

‘ swimmer has posted. And considering his established

credibility in the two long distance events, 500 and 1,000
freestyle, he poses a triple threat in tomorrow’s meet. ’

In a pinch Krause will also anchor the freestyle relay.

Mike Toth will give Martin Staley his toughest com-,
petition of the season. He has defeated some of the best
divers in the East on theqthree meter board, his specialty
and lost only onceon the one meter board. He -will be a
solid contender for the Pool record in the diving event as
will Krause in the freestyle events.

Rounding out the triumphant trio is Jim Stiefel. He is

-V the short distance sprint specialist on the Syracuse team.

‘ Already this season he hasbested 49 seconds with a 48.8
posting in the 100 yd. freestyle. Tom Smith predicted that

. he willswim a 49 second 100 yd. freestyle in.Saturday’s
meet and be in the pool to beat the best Syracuse has to
offer. . A‘ . a _

Mark Cohen isn’t to be forgotten in the sprints. Brad-
shaw explained that he has plateaued ati50 plus,for.the
past several meets and that one of these times he will

‘ break that barrier. Bradshaw is hopeful that tomorrow
will be the day. A . -

IfSyracuse doesn’t swim Krause in the 1,000 and the
500, Fred Lewis will have one of the best races of the
year on his hands. John Holohan from Syracuse is only
swimming five seconds better than Lewis at the present
moment. Lewis meanwhile has been practicing with the
sole intent of upsetting the Orangeman. 1

Ed Cahill said he will be out to betterhis-personal
best time in the 200 yd. backstroke (2:07). John Car-
Vance of Syracuse is swimming a 2:10 and showing signs
ofimprovement. , ‘ . ‘

"I think we’ll do pretty good times,” Ed Cahill said.
"I think'we're in good shape with everybody shooting for
personal bests and the victory."

Cats unable to split Owl zone

 

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

‘After the Temple Owls had whip-
ped the Pitt Panthers (10-10) by a
89-74 score on Wednesday night,
Assistant Coach Fran Webster be-
stowed lavish praise on Temples

coach. Harry Litwack.

"You know, tonight’s the first
time in two years that I felt that
we didn't have a chance." he said.

' "This is the best all-around team
I‘ve seen this year."

partisan crowd of 2,812 at the-

Field House a display of tenacious
zone defense and the art of hitting
the open man underneath for the

layup. '

Temple consistently had the
good percentage shot underneath,
though Coach Buzz Ridl switched
from his usual zone to a man de-
fense midway through the first
half. Sophomore Joe Newman

height advantage getting most of
his 21 points from close in.

Conversely, the quick -Temple
zone forced the Panthers to shoot
from long range Kent Scott was
the only cager able to shoot over
it with any accuracy.-

Scott, now Pitt's sixth all-time
leading scorer dazzled everyone

with a remarkable display of 25',

foot jumpers, canning 14 of 24 for
game honors with 28. ,

Though the Owls were in con- '

trol of the action from the open-
ing. minutes, they stowed , the
game away midway through the
second half. They erased any
hopes for a Panther rally with a
10-1 scoring burst in a two min-
ute period, to more than double
their eight point lead.

ed great discipline at_both ends of
the court. The_Owls passed with

Even Bill Knight, Pitt‘s sopho-
more star had his troubles against
the Temple 3-2 zone. Knight was
unable to hit his usual deadly shot
from the left corner until the
game was out of reach, though he
did pick up 19 points overall.

Mickey Martin was the only
other Panther able to dent Lit-
wack’s famous zone. In his sec-
ond start, Mickey had l7 points
though the accuracy of his start-
'ing debut last Friday wasn’t
equalled. '

Coach Ridl echoed Webster's

feelings after the contest. "They"

played well enough tonight to stay
with anyone in the country," he
said.

Staying with the Little Dukes

point for point through most of .

the first half, the Frosh contain-
ed the same Duquesne offense
that blew them off the court only
three weeks ago. A late surge, led
by highly touted Oscar Jackson
and top scorer Jack Yun enabled
the Bluffites to take a 49-42 mar-
gin into the lockerroom at half-
time.

Recruiting
battles

by MARTY HELLM.AN
Associate Sports Editor

 

afternoon or winter evening. But the majority of crucial ath-
letic battles between the two teams actually took place
months or years ago. with a great expenditure of time.

Results‘ of the annual recruiting wars at an athlete‘s
home influence future teams‘ performances on the field. Even
the best coaches won’t produce a winner without good ath-
letes. -

Convincing the blue-chip prospects to attend a certain
school requires a combined effort of alumni. coaches and ath-

letic personnel. Since many schoolboy stars have a wide vari-

ety of schools to choose from. slight shades of gray may in-
fluence his final decision.

Presently, it seems Pitt’s debits slightly outweigh its as- ’

sets for influencing recruits, though a long range turnabout

'.is beginning to develop. The recent appointment of a full-

time recruiter is one step on the long road back.

After talking with several football coaches and sitting
in on a weekend recruiting session. I realize how many more
steps"Pitt must take before it regainsconsistent prominence
in football and other sports. ’ V, 

Pitt’s last eight years of losing football hurts in two ways-
lack of publicity and recognition outside the Western Penn-
sylvania area. and the ensuing tag of a ‘bunch of losers.‘

Additionally, Pitt does not have a Booster Club as most
other schools do. .Though the Golden Panthers aid in recruit-
ing, they are not organized for that sole purpose. Last No-
vember, Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski discussed his
hopes of establishing such a club. However, assistance from
such a club would undoubtedly take several years before fruit-
l0Il. '

As I followed several football recruits around Pitt Sta-
dium. I didn't notice any of them being" overly impressed
with the facilities. While a coach. showed them the new
weight ‘room’ (a dimly lit converted locker room), I couldn’t
help but guess what the recruits were pondering maybe that
slick new weight room they had seen at Notre Dame. or
that inviting workout gym at Michigan State or Penn State.

Obviously, the" recruit’s performances on the gridiron
won’t be determined by the physical plant. but a glory seek-
ing high school senior may give it more than just a casual
thought before his decision.

Though handicapped by these things, the coaches‘ stress
Pitt’s'numerous advantages to the hilt. Coaches Ralph Jelic
and Foge Fazio repeatedly spoke about Pitt’s phenomenal
record of graduating athletes and the numbers of athletes
who reached professional schools.

Basically. all interested schools offer the same vista for
a recruit. A combination of many small differences will alter
the final decision. He may weigh a broad spectrum of differ-
ences—all the way from the medical or law school’s policy
on accepting that schools undergraduates to the appearance,
of the recruiters and the facilities. » —

The lure of the Golden Dome of Notre Dame and the
Bear Bryant Hilton Dormitory at Alabama and numerous
other obstacles face the Pitt coaches. Though the battle is
uphill. it is by no means unattainable. Winning these battles
now may mean victories for the spectators in the years ahead.

_just too much for

"Munich bound?s2sse

 

by VINCE DI NARDO

Tonight at Madison Square Garden Bill Rea. Pitt's all-time long
jump record holder and premier triple jumper. will attempt to take ad-
vantage of his first big break at the Olympic Invitational.

The Ol_ympic Invitational is the top track invitational in the coun-
try. Rea, the only Pitt trackster invited. is anxious to get national ex-

posure because he plans to repre-
sent the United States in the sum-
mer Olympics at Munich. Rea
views theinvitational as a step-
ping stone to the Olympic trials.

If Rea makes it past the Olympic
trials on June 29-31, his ensuing
trip to Germany would be a home-
coming. Bill was born in Austria.
His father was in the service

' there before coming back to Eli-

zabeth. Pa. At Elizabeth Forward
High School as a senior. Billy be-
gan long and triple jumping for
the first time.

When Jim Banner, head track
coach, recruited jumping Billy,
Rea was long jumping 22 feet,
amazing considering it was his
first year.

The progress that Rea has made
since his arrival at Skyscraper
U. has been more amazing. In his
first jump as a Panther, Rea
jumped 23’1". By the end of his
freshman year he broke Herb
Douglas‘ all-time Pitt record with
a 24’12“ jump.

So far this year. Rea has brok-
en his own record thrice, with
jumps of 24’81/4”, 24’83/4" and 25’
10" (outdoor).

.“Freshmen have to go through
hell in their firstyear of compe-

,tit_ion,” said Banner early last

year, “they may be better athletes
but they have to get adjusted and
spend time behind lesser athletes
until they get the hang of things.”

Rea spent little time getting
adjusted and defied his coach's
words. Instead of going through
hell, he had a hell of a year.

Even if Rea doesn't make the
Olympic team, he plans to be in
Munich to visit his grandmothers. ,
He would much rather be showing
his grandmother the progress
he‘s made since he left Austria.
however. *

The fact that Bill is only a sopho-
more, doesn’t bother Banner. The
last time the Olympics were held
in Germany, John Woodriff, a Pitt
freshman at the time, won the 800
meter event.

“Wouldn’t it be ironic if Rea
won a title as a sophomore 36
years after Woodriff did it in ‘36.
This is the first time the Olympics
have been held in Germany since

,l936_," noted Banner.

"This weekend will be a great
experience for me," said Rea. “_I
think people are beginning torec'-
ognize my name.

Among’ the names Rea would
like to be recognized with are
Henry Heinz of Southern Califor-~
nia, John McAllister of UCLA,
Norm Tate of ’AAU, Ron Coleman
of AAU, and Ralph Boston of
AAU. Boston, by the way, holds
the world indoor long jump mark
of 27’2'/2”.

'-‘McAllister and Tate have both
done 26 feet this year.” comment-

Olympics keep   Rea jumping

BILI REA, Pitt's top long jumper, warms up for meet competition at the
Field House. Rea was the only Pitt trackster invited to compete in tonight's
Olympic Invitational in New York's Madison Square Garden. I

ed Rea. "and Tate and Coleman
both did 27 feet last year. I‘ve
done 2510” in competition but
I've done 26 feet\a couple of times
in practice. My eventual goal is
27 feet.“

Flashes drive for IM title repeat

by PAUL DeVITO

Wednesday afternoon at Trees
Hall, the powerful Black Flashes
continued on their winning ways
by defeating a fine SNAFU squad
by the score of 78-57. Leading the
Flashes was Lance Wall with 22
points.

Highlighting the game was a
hard and spirited play exhibited
by both teams, but the final out-

' come was evident after a few min-

utes of pla_y. The excellent shoot-
ing,‘ hard‘ rebounding, and inpene-
trable defense of the Flashes was
the SNAFU
players. '

SNAFU jumpedto a quick 4-0
lead on two long jumpers by Ron

, Chukta before the Flashes switch-

ed from a man-to-man to a two-
one-two zone defense. Due to its

_ inability to penetrate this defense,

SNAFU was forced to stay outside
to shoot. '

Even though SNAFU hit well
from the outside, the overall
Black Flash attack was too strong
to beat. The Flashes displayed a
devastating fast break, featuring

deft ~ball-handling and accurate
shooting ability.

Along with Walls 22 points.
Phil Ayres added 12 while John
Simpson hit 10 for the Flashes.
Ron Chukta hit on 10 long outside
buckets’ for 20 points and scoring
honors for SNAFU. Paul Parrada
scored 16in support.

The Black Flashes boast a per-
fect 7-0 record while SNAFU con-
tinues with a 4-3 mark. The Flash-
es at this point are making a
strong bid to repeat as IM chain-
pions.

In other IM play, the Zips beat

a weak Aug the Dog squad, 76-41,
while the Jives
56 victory over Brotherhood.

The referees appeared to pre-
sent the Flashes and SNAFU
squads with added p~‘oblems.
Players from the Flashes and
SNAFU complained throughout
their contest about the poor offi-
ciating. (, A ,

At one point. the Flashes called
a time out in order to get a referee
from the IM officials. It seems the
refs would reverse their initial

call whenever the players would

complain loud enough.

. Power volleyball 3.1.1.

spike to sports scene

by VICKY VETERE

Power volleyball is not a sport played by paunchy old men
Saturday afternoons at the YMCA. It is not the volleyball played by
most high schools and colleges in the U.S.

Power volleyball is a game where the.ball travels at speeds ex-
ceeding 120 mph on spikes. It is a game where the serve develops from

a mere means of getting the ball
over the net to an artful. preci-
sioned attack. And seeing such a
serve being received quickly illus-
trated how the word .“dig“ got its
name.

At Pitt. an attempt is being
made to resurrect this sport in
its true form. Wes Sime. a grad-
uate teaching assistant currently
working on his Ph.D. in exercise
physiology, and Dr. Kiselev. as-
sistant professor in the Slavic De-

‘partment, have joined forces in
an attempt to develop a power vol-
leyball team at Pitt with the aim
of reaching varsity status. ’ _

‘Dr. Kiselev explained, “Power
volleyball is extremely popular in
both Europe and Ceentral and

South America. It has been an of-

ficial Olympic sport since 1964.
Here in the United States it is
played largelyon the West Cost
but many Eastern schools ‘also
have teams. '

“So far, due primarily to lack
of.;interest. Pitt has no men's vol-
leyball squad. intramural or var-
sity. There is a misconception

’ about volle_yball which I. think ac-

counts for the lack of interest it
suffers. People think it‘s a sport
for old men who are outofshape.

\

“Because most of thepeople
are from last year’s team, we
-have a lot of potential. Shooting
takes a great deal of concentra-
tion, the right attitude, and you.
have to be inshape.”

The Army ROTC supplies the
Clubrwith much of the rifles and
ammunition. ‘ '

' When the Rifle Club was still
funded by the Athletic Depart-
ment. it was not allowed to have
women shoot on the team. This

’ ruling has undergone change. as

have other aspects ofthe Club.
and women are now permitted to
compete.

They think it‘s a rather slow—mov-
ing. passive type of game.

Much of the volle_yball played in
the U.S. is of this sort. but this is

not real volleyball: it isn‘t power

volleyball."

Wes Sime added, “It’s a bit
ironic that volleyball actually
originated here in the U.S. in the
l890’s at Springfield College in
Massachusetts by a man named
Dr. Morgan, and the sport has not
yet been able to reach its full ca-
pacity in this country.”

Currently efforts are being made
to develop‘power volleyball here
at Pitt every -Tuesday and Thurs-
day afternoon from 4 to 6 at the
men‘s gymin Trees Hall.

Dr. Kiseley stated‘. "We_ are
trying to attract any student in-
terested in .volle_yball who has
either had experience playing
volleyball in high school or who
has general athletic abilities and
would like to learn to play.

"We also invite all foreign stu-
dents who play volleyball to join
us. Our aim is to eventually devel-
op our players.t0'the point where
we can form a varsity team and
compete with other colleges."
