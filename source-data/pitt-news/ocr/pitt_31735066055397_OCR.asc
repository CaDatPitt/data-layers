our-organ
transplant

Erin Lindeman

Senlor Staff Wrlter

The first child to receive a
quadruple-organ transplant is listed in
good condition at Children’s Hospital
after having surgery in August.

Three-year old Brendon Ednie, of
Florida, ‘underwent the 20-hour
surgery on Aug. 21 and 22. He
received a heart, a liver and two lungs
during theltransplant.

The surgery was announced to the
media on Friday, after officials
deemed him in stable condition.

Only a few people in the world
have received this quadruple trans-
plant. Brendon was the only child.

While in surgery, Brendon
received the heart and lung trans-
plants first. Dr. Frank Pigula, director
of pediatric cardiopulmonary trans-
plantation at Children’s Hospital, said
if the liver transplant was performed
first, Brendon would not have sur-
vived. -

“He had cardiac defects that
needed to be fixed first,” Pigula said.

Brendon was born with a rare
genetic disorder called Alagille
Syndrome, which left him without
bile ducts in his liver and pulmonary
arteries to his lungs. He was predict-
ed to live another year.

Now, 3 and a half months after
the the operation, Brendon is in good
condition, and he’s getting better.

Brendon is breathing through a
tube in his trachea, which supplies
him with extra oxygen and air pres-
sure, and he’s being fed a supplemen-
tary diet through another tube.

Because he didn’t eat well before
the transplant, he had a tube put into
his stomach. This was removed so the
surgeons could perform the trans-
plant. The minor surgery to place the
tube back into his stomach is sched-
uled for sometime today.

“Although nothing is ever minor

with Brendon,” Pigula said.

Silence. ,_

That is all that could be sensed in the
Fitzgerald Field House after the Panther
men’s basketball team’s stunning loss to
Connecticut.

“We didn’t say anything after the

game except a prayer,” said Pitt head
coach Ralph Willard. y

Connecticut came into Fitzgerald
Field House ranked No. 1 in the country
and proved why, beating Pitt 70-69 with
two seconds remaining after trailing most
of the game. A

The Panthers came out with ﬁre in
their eyes in front of the sellout crowd to
take a 40-35 lead into the second half.

UConn hung tough, but Pitt had a 68-
62 lead with just 54 ticks left on the clock.

Down the stretch, Khalid El—Amir1
made a three-pointer to bring the Huskies
within three. '

Kellii Taylor missed the first of a
one-and—one foul shot opportunity, giving
UConn the ball. -

The Huskies brought the ball down
the ﬂoor but got a traveling call with 20
seconds left on the clock.

When the Panthers inbounded the
ball, Kevin Freeman immediately fouled
Ricardo Greer, who made one of two
shots at the line to give Pitt a four-point
lead. ‘

On UConn’s next trip down the ﬂoor,

Kappa Sigma will sue Pitl
after losing suspension appeal

Erin Lindeman

Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s Kappa Sigma fraternity
will fight in court a University deci-
sion to suspend it for violating an
on-campus housing policy, saying

the rule is illegal, unfair and
immoral.
However, Kappa Sigma

President Nick Moraites conceded
that by the time the fraternity finds a
lawyer and begins the lawsuit,- the
suspension may be over.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
the University will defend itself .in
court if the fraternity does decide to
sue.

“We believe our policies are rea-
sonable and defensible in court,”
Service said.

The fraternity originally
appealed the suspension but learned
Wednesday that Pitt denied the

_appeal when reporters from two

Pittsburgh newspapers started ask-
ing the fraternity for comments
about the decision.

The rule. states that fraternities

A must liveon campus to be recog-

nized by the University.

Robert Gallagher, the interim.

vice‘ chancellor of student affairs,
said Wednesday the decision to sus-
pend the fraternity is final and
Kappa Sigma has three possible
courses of action after losing the
appeal.

Kappa Sigma can continue tc
live off campus as an independent
fraternity, but that would prohibit
members from participating in
University-sanctioned Greek func-
tions.

The fraternity could also leave

‘its current residence and re-establish

itself in one of the on-campus frater-
nity houses under construction, or it

could challenge the University’s'

policy in a court of law.

Service said the fraternity com-
plex will be built within two or three
years, and the University will work
in conjunction with the fraternities
to design and build the houses they
want.

But Moraites said moving into

an on-campus fraternity house was-
out of the question because Pitt:
expects the fraternities to raise;

$500,000 to buy the houses.

Kappa Sigma learned in earlyfi
November that the University was;
taking away its recognition for vio-5

lating the policy.

The policy was enacted in

February and was prompted, Pitt
officials say, by numerous arrests‘
and difficulties with fraternities. A

Service also said there are two
other reasons the policy was enact-j
ed. Pitt thinks having all organiza-2
tions on campus makes a better all-?
around experience for the

Pitt students support charities
during Christmas season

Frank 

    

For The Pitt N" ,.

When Andre Myer, akes up
Christmas morning, he vs_:(on.~.t bein his
own home, he won’t sit beside his own

Christmas tree, and he may not get to see»-_
-5’: '.?system. The Blue and Gold Society
' donated a much-needed vacuum cleaner,

many members of his own family.

He will wake up_ surrounded by

friends and families he has met only

within the past couple months, friends -he’ .
met at Family House, which he describes .-~ "'

as a warmer and more comfortable place
to stay than any hospital or hotel room he
may ﬁnd himself in. ' '

Family House is a; nonproﬁt organi- _

zation that has provided temporary hous-
ing for hospital out—patients and their
families for more than 15 years. Sonya
Shumway, the development director,
describes it as a temporary home away
from home for peo-
ple who come to
Pittsburgh from all
over the world,
awaiting transplants
and other treatments.

Myers, 21,
needs a heart trans-
plant. He has been
living at Family
House for more than
10 ' months, away
from his home and
his friends in Erie.

On Monday,’
Myers didn’t receive
his new heart, but he
did experience some
compassion from his
peers, through the
Blue and Gold
Society’s Operation
Santa Claus.

This is the sev-
enth year for

Operation Santa Claus, a project through _

which students and organizations pur-
chase gifts for patients, such as Myers,
who live at Family House.

Alyson Wallach, Student
Government Board president, described
the operation as a humbling experience.

“Watching the University communi-
ty come together and bring smiles to the
faces of so many here at Family House is
truly the backbone of Operation Santa
Claus,” she said.

‘Family House resident Gloria
Henken said, “It’s hard enough to be
away from home for the holidays, and it’s
hard to get into the holiday spirit with so
much on our minds all the time. This is
such a nice thing the students do, and I
can’t thank them enough.”

Blue and Gold Society collected
more than 200 gifts for Family House
this season, a little less than in the past.

She Said

   ~ ~ ' blessing,” she said.

— V-George Mongell, Blue and Gold
Society’s special events chairman, said
this year was a little different because
there were fewer gifts, but they were of
better quality. ' '

The residents of Tower B combined
their funds to buy Family House a stereo

and the Black Action Society bought

portable CD players.

‘Shumway said this year’s operation
was incredible.
“It’s really overwhelming, the degree

' of generosity and commitment that went

into this project,” she said.

" Pat Siger, executive director of
Family House, described the operation as
“heroic.”

“I can’t thank the Pittsburgh commu-
nity enough for the happiness and the
warmth that they
brought to the fami-
lies here. It truly is a

For those ‘who
missed the opportu-
nity to purchase gifts
for Operation Santa

Outreach needs stu-
dents to participate in
a Christmas celebra:
tion and‘ dinner on
Dec. >16 at the
F r i e n d s h i p
Community Church
on Robinson St. in
Oakland.

The dinner is
for the students and
families of The New
Beginning Learning
Center, an after-
school tutoring center. “It’s a community
festivity,” said Gwendolyn Thorne, pro-
gram assistant. “It brings everybody
together.”

This ﬁrst community Christmas din-
ner will be followed by the 6th armual
West Oakland Light-Up Night. “The din-
ner should help get more families
involved this year,” Thorne said. “And
nothing attracts people like a free din-
ner.”

Volunteers may also help with a
Christmas dinner for the homeless,
sponsored by area hotels. The hotels sup-
ply the food and the space for the dinner.

“One of the big things for homeless
people is loneliness,” said project coordi-
nator Steve Zupcic. “We need our volun-
teers to not only help serve food, but
more importantly, to greet these people
and give them some company on
Christmas.”

Black Homecoming queen
defies stereotypes

the Delta Sigma Theta sorority; and
the National Panhellenic
Association.

As a senior this year, she ran for
Homecoming queen. She hoped she
could give other black students
someone to look up to.

“I didn’t feel like I fit the stereo-
type for Homecoming queen,” said

Williams. “Everyone associates
Homecoming as a white Greek
thing.”

Williams said she wanted to
break that mold. She said the prereq-
uisite for Homecoming royalty is
each student has to be an undergrad-
uate with at least a 2.5 QPA.

“There hasn’t . been a black
Homecoming queen since I’ve been
here,” said Williams. ‘

When she ran, she promised her-
self she would only spend $10 on her
entire campaign —— but she went over
budget by $2.

“No matter how much candy you
give people, they’re going to vote for
whoever they feel like voting for,”
said Williams.

During her campaign, she saw
everyone making hundreds of photo-
copies in _Copy Cat. Instead of
spending money, she asked . her
friends to make the copies for her at
their jobs.

While campaigning she had to

-balance her responsibilities with all

the groups she’s involved in.
“I do it all with very little sleep

and time management,”_ said
Williams.
Pitt . junior Charles Baxter,

Williams friend for three years, said
he got to know Williams better when
she became a FOCUS leader.

“She’s like the clean-up person,”
said Baxter. “She likes things orga-
nized, and she thinks things
through.” ‘

Baxter said Williams coordinated
FOCUS’ trip to Washington, D.C., by

' herself.

“She’s matured a lot since she
first got here. She’s become a more
communicative person,” Baxter said.

Her communication skills have
helped her become a program direc-
tor at WPTS. V _

“She keeps people in line at the
station,” said Leon Paul, V station
manager at WPTS. ‘

Paul‘ agrees that Williams is

' organized and said she schedules all

the radio’s shows and makes sure
that they adhere to the Federal
Communications_ Commission’s
rules.

THE PITT N Ews

MONDAY, 14 DECEMBER 1998

Carrie Hager
Staff Writer

On Super Bowl Sunday last year,
Theodore Windt received a call from
the media, asking him to comment on
President Clinton’s resignation. The
problems were, Windt said, that he
wanted to watch the Super Bowl
without interruption, and Clinton
wasn’t really resigning.

Windt, chairman of Pitt’s com-
munications department, was one of
three keynote speakers who dis-
cussed the Clinton Crisis in David
Lawrence Hall on Thursday. He was
joined by Peter Shane, a Pitt law pro-
fessor, and Bert Rockman, a profes-
sor of political science.

Windt kept a crowd of about 50
people laughing as he candidly talked
about a very serious subject — the
impeachment of the president. All
three speakers had a different focus:
Windt discussed problems with

"media handling of the crisis, Shane
"focused on what the future might

hold after impeachment, and
Rockman talked about the role of

partisan politics.

Shane opened with what he said
his “crystal ball’’ showed for the
president’s future. “My prediction is
he is not removed from office,” he
said before explaining some of the

Pitt faculty discuss

legal aspects of the impeachment
process. _

The House of Representatives
must vote to impeach the president. If
that happens, the trial moves to the
Senate which must
have a two—thirds‘
majority vote to
oust the president
from office.

But Shane said

the impeachment
process lacks
precedence since

Andrew Johnson is
the only president
ever to be
impeached by the
House of
Representatives.
The Senate did not
endorse impeach-
ment, and Johnson
remained in office.
R o c k m a n
agreed with Shane
on two points:
Clinton will still be
in office this time next year, and the
impeachment process is still unchart-
ed and undefined.
Rockman also said that everyone sees
the impeachment process differently.
“We see it through the lens of our
own partisan spectacles,” he said,

He Said

adding that whatever the outcome is,
it should have general acceptance.

“The majority wants to see this-

process come to an end.”

“It isn’t‘ relevant to people’s
lives, so they don’t
understand why
such a‘
made,” Rockman
said. “Intensity is
what_counts, indif-
ference means
nothing. Most peo-
ple are indifferent

to the . whole
process.”
The process

has made it this far,
he said, becau__se it
is difficult to stop a
legal process once
it has started.
Shane said he
felt the impeach-
ment process was
dragging on too
long. He compared
the ongoing
impeachment process to watching a
baseball game during the rain delay.
He added that even if Clinton
escapes impeachment, his presidency
will still be greatly affected.
“If he is acquitted of, say, no high
crime, he should resign to Gore

fuss is

Clinton impeachment crisis

because he won’t be able to continue
as before.” _

Windt took a different focus,
talking strictly about the negative
effect the media has had on the
impeachment process so far.

“There has been poor journalism
in the reporting of the incident, and
it’s aftermath,” he said.

He went back to the phone call on
Super Bowl Sunday. He said the per-
son on the phone wanted to talk to
him about a resignation that, in reali-
ty, was not going to happen. He said
the media started talking about the
impeachment process before
Congress did, and they started the
rumor that Clinton was going to
resign.

“No one wanted to be left behind.
Everyone competed to get the latest
scoop, rumor, etc.,” he said.
“‘Nightline,’ for three weeks, dedi-
cated every program to the scandal as
if nothing else was happening.”

Because of the problems with the
media, he said people need to have a
strong background in political history
to make sense of what they see on
television and read in newspapers.

None of the speakers felt that
Clinton would actually be found
guilty. “Whatever happens,” said
Shane, “Clinton will be around long
enough to watch.”

The tube will aid Brendon’s fami-
ly in caring for him and feeding him,
according to Pigula.

Pigula said if Brendon’s condition
continues to improve, he will leave
the hospital in 10-14
days for Children’s
Institute, a
Pittsburgh rehabilita-
tion center for chil-
dren who have had a
prolonged stay in a
hospital or who are
physically chal-
lenged.

“[Brendon] has
spent a large portion
of his life in hospi-
tals, both pre— and
post-transplant,”
Pigula said.

He will have to
make frequent return
visits to the hospital,
as well as take med-
ication so he does
not reject the trans-
planted organs.

_This particular four—organ trans-
plant has only been performed on one
other person in the United States. A
few other operations have been per-
formed in the United Kingdom.

atric transplantation at Children’s

reduced number of bile ducts that can
lead to -abnormalities in a number of
organs.

Bile ducts
drain a person’s
normal secretions
from the liver.
Without the bile
ducts, the liver
fails. If a person
has this condi-
tion, he or she
often requires a
transplant, Pigula
said.

Brendon wait-
ed for 10 months
for the donated
organs. All four
came from the
same donor.

Pigula said
Brendon has had
a nice period of
stability. He
requires a little
support from the tube in his trachea
for some extra oxygen and pressure,
but all breaths are on his own.

“He is happy, playful, and acting
as close to a normal child in a hospi-
tal [as possible],” Pigula said. “He
will also live much longer than if he
had gone without treatment.”

IOWA CITY, Iowa (U -WIRE) — As
many people try to avoid the long lines
and crowded stores of the holiday season,
shopping online is expected to be more
popular than ever.

Nearly two-thirds of American adults
— about 131 million people — made a
purchase by mail, phone or computer last
year, according to ﬁgures released by the
New York City-based Simmons Market
Research Bureau.

This nationwide trend of technologi-
cally enhanced shopping has many
believing that gift-giving has never been
easier.

‘There is a lot to be said for the abili-
ty to shop at 3 a.m. in your underwear,”
said Judy Tenzer, a spokeswoman for
American Express. “Using a credit card to
shop online has been proven to be very
safe for consumers.”

Online shopping has been increasing
rapidly in recent years and is expected to
peak around the holiday season, Tenzer
said. In a random survey of 800 people,
10 percent of consumers said they intend-
ed to use the Internet for their holiday
shopping, a 6—percent increase over last
year, she said.

Still, many shoppers are apprehen-

classes are

sive about giving out their credit-card
numbers over the Internet.

University of Iowa sophomore
Malina DeW1ld said she doesn’t believe
the claims that shopping on the Internet is
safe.

‘‘I would never give out my credit-
card number over the Web,” she said.
“Call me paranoid, but I am just afraid
that my number would get passed around
and end up ripping me off.”

Tenzer said using a browser with pro-
tections such as the Secured Socket Layer
and Secured Electronic Transaction will
safeguard the customer. Most browsers
are equipped with these functions that
encrypt or scramble the purchase infor-
mation, she said.

Using a credit card when placing an
online order is protected by the Fair Credit
Billing Act, according to a report by the
Federal Trade Commission. Under this
law, customers have the right to dispute
charges and temporarily withhold pay-
ment in the event of non-delivery or other
types of fraud.

In these instances, credit-card users
are generally liable for the ﬁrst $50 in
charges only, the com1nission’s report
said.

This same organization is what
has helped in her second semester as
an RA, now on the seventh ﬂoor of
Lothrop Hall. She said she hasn’t had
any problems with her ﬂoor.

“I enjoy working with a new RD
and staff. Everyone works well
together,” said Williams.

Williams, born and raised in
Washington, D.C., is an only child.
She attended Duke Ellington School
for the Arts High School. While still
in high school, she wanted to be a
conductor, and during her senior
year, she’ conducted several pieces of
music.

She decided not to continue to
pursue conducting because she “did-
n’t want to get into the competitive-
ness.”

During her llth—grade year, she
was placed in Advanced Placement

history and fell in love with the
course.

Williams said she always saw her
high school as different. She said the
school was small, and during a good
year, the school had 500 students.

“You could walk down the hall
and see people singing,” said
Williams.

Williams said she chose to attend
Pitt because she wanted to be a pre-
med major and Pitt was a good place
to go. Now she’s a history and com-
munications major. After she gradu-
ates, she plans to attend law school.

She advises all students to
“remember how you got here and
while you’re here to get a good edu-
cation. If it wasn’t for our grandpar-
ents’ and parents’ sacrifice, many of
us wouldn’t be here.”

University. Also, community mem-
bers have told Pitt it is important to
residents that all fraternities reside
on campus. '

“We are trying to accommodate
the community, as well,” Service
said.

Moraites questioned whether Pitt
would help residents by revoking the
fraternity’s charter, given that Kappa
Sigma could remain off campus as
an independent group.

“If the community has a problem
with us, wouldn’t it have been
smarter to have the University on
top of us? Now, we have no one to
answer to,” Moraites said.

Kappa Sigma moved. into its

mom PAGE 2

house at 245 N. Dithridge St. in
August, knowingly violating the
policy.

“The policy says that any organi-
zation that wishes to have a house to
live in or a facility to hold meetings
must be located within campus
boundaries,” Service said.

Pitt suspended Kappa Sigma’s
University recognition after two
hearings within the University judi-
cial system. The first hearing was
declared a mistrial because the fra-
ternity was charged under the Code
of Student Conduct instead of within
the Office of Student Activities.
Only individuals can be tried under
the Code of Student Conduct.

tering CPR. They tried to transport
Beitel’s gumey downstairs from the
second-ﬂoor basketball court via ele-
vator, but the elevator was too small.
While carrying Beitel to the ambu-
lance, medics could continue mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation but not heart
compressions, Martelli said.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
the medics told Pitt Police they sus-
pected cardiac arrest as the cause of
death.

Beitel’s fourth roommate, Matt
Scola, said Beitel had an abnormality
in the electrical impulses of the heart
but that it was under control. As far
as Scola could recall, Beitel took
medicine for the problem for about
five years‘ during his teens but never
during college. .

An autopsy proved inconclusive,

so announcement of the cause of
death is delayed pending further
tests, according to the Allegheny
County Coroner’s Office."

Beitel played many pick-up bas-
ketball games last year, Scola said.
The two also lived together then, and
Scola and Smith said they never
noticed any problems with Beitel’s
health. _

Pitt has made counselors avail-
able to Beitel’s family and room-
mates.

Beitel was a junior psychology
major. He was from Springdale, Pa.,
about 15 miles northeast of
Pittsburgh.

Beitel’s ‘viewing was Sunday
afternoon, and his funeral is today at
11 a.m. at Springdale United
Presbyterian Church.

shopping categories, including clothing,
food, toys and sporting goods. -

Iowa freshman Rodney Gray said he
has shopped online for clothing in the past
and had no real problems; however, he
had to place his order more than once.»

“It wasn’t a rip—off or anything. I
think that the company just didn’t know
what it was doing yet,” he said.
“Eventually, I got what I wanted, and it
turned out OK.”

Shopping through reputable compa-
nies that clearly state their policies for

returning and refunding on their Web
page is the safest way to place an order,
Tenzer said.

“If the Web page does not make its
policies clear, then simply go through
another company,” she said. “Customers
should pay close attention to their key
strokes to ensure they are getting what
they want.” ' '

Although Gray said shopping via the
Internet was convenient for him, he would
be hesitant about shopping online for the

. holidays.

“I would be afraid the stuff wouldn’t
come in time or something,” he said.

If the Ku Klux Klan wants police
protection, it should pay for it

Apparently, extremist right-
wing groups feel that government
is a little too big and infringing
on their constitutional rights. So
much so that when they hold a
rally and use police officers to
protect them from irate protest-
ers, they don’t feel the need to
pay the city.

The Ku Klux Klan-refuses to
pay the $49,552 owed to the city
of Erie for the use of 160 police
officers (83 percent of the entire
Erie police force) who monitored
a recent Klan rally. As with pri-
vate security firms, the police
force must be paid for services
rendered for monitoring rallies,
escorting trucks with oversized
loads, and after-hours protection.

Perhaps Klan Grand Dragon
Kay Ryan, who is adamant that
the Klan will not pay the money
owed to Erie, thinksthat because
Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a
donkey with 12 unpaid disciples,
the Klan can walk through Erie
looking like asses and not pay the
160 cops, provided by a govern-
ment it-feels is too big and moral-
ly compromised, monitoring it.

With its inflammatory mes-
sages and penchant for commit-

ting hate crimes, the Klan cer— '

tainly needs the protection of 160
policemen.»But just like every
other organization that requires
the protection of the police, the
Klan should pay for it.

Erie Mayor Joyce Savocchio
fears the city will never be paid,
but she should remember that the
only way the FBI was able to nail
Al Capone was on charges of tax
evasion. Perhaps a hefty fine
would reduce the amount of
crosses and white sheets the
Pennsylvania American Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan would be
able to buy. Perhaps some jail
time, when it’s legal to not pay
for police protection, would help
remind them that even God—fear-
ing, sheet-wearing white folk
need to fulfill their civic obliga-
tions. ,

We value the First
Amendment as much as everyone
else, including the Klan, which
calls any opposition to its pres-
ence an infringement on its con-
stitutional rights. But whenever
Klan members roll into town and
require the use .of the town’s

p police force to protect them from

those ‘offended by their hate
rhetoric, they should_pay for it.

A haunting for the holidays

As a stocking stuifer for the reds in your life,
you may be considering shelling out $13 a pop
for Ve1so’s 150th anniversary edition of “The
Communist Manifesto.” Before you do, consid-
er that you can pick up an International
Publishers copy for $2 at the Carreathers and
Foster Bookstore in East Liberty.

ItistruethattheVersoeditionisinhardback
with a snazzy dust jacket and a pagemarker of
the appropriate scarlet hue, while the IP paper-
back is a mere pamphlet, complete with staples.
But that, you see, is the point. Aside ﬁom an
introduction by Eric Hobsbawm, the Verso edi-
tion has nothing new or different unless one eon-
siders the packaging. It is commodity fetishism
for Marxists. As Alexander Cockburn has point-
ed out, a. spartan pamphlet version is more
appropriate for ﬂrose who are serious about over-
throwing capitalism

The Manifesto was ﬁrst published at the
beginning of a year in which all of Europe erupt-
ed in a revolutionary wave, the likes
of which the continent has not seen '
since without a major international
war to spark it Marx and Engels
were obscure ﬁgures at the time, and
the original had a small press run,
although the two men would go on to gain
prominence as leaders of what would later be
known as the First International.

The Manifesto does not possess nearly the
sophistication of either rnan’s most theoretical
work Its analytical acuity pales before Marx’s
“The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,”
its attention to historical detail falls short of
Engels’ “The Peasant War in Germany,” and
even its polernical sharpness cannot match
Marx’s defense of the Paris Commune in ‘The
Civil War in France.” Nevertheless, the
Manifesto does possess its own charm.

It offers a succinct summation of what the

' two men were later to call “scientiﬁc socialism,”

along with a large dose of exhortation culminat-
ing in the memorable closing lines. It is probably
the greatest piase of political propaganda ever
written (and I use the word “propagan ” in a
value-neutral sense), and it has been translated
into more languages and read by more people
than any other book with the exception of the
Bible. Most who have read Marx and Engels
have read only “The Communist Manifesto,”
but. its popularity should not be held  it.

JOHN

LACNY

COLUMNIST

 

Due to the minor spark of interest which
accompanied its 150th anniversary, “The
Communist Manifesto” has been read or reread
by numerous mainstream reviewers. It is the
reaction of such non-Marxists that is the most
entertaining to watch. They discover that the
inane babbling of American conservatives about
the “breakdown of the family” — which they
attribute to a nebulous and unexplained “decline
in moral values” —— is really nothing new and
thatMarxandEngels wroteacenturyandahalf
ago ﬂrat “by the action of modem industry all
family ties among the proletarians are torn asun-

- der-99

They ﬁnd, to their surprise, that the
Manifesto foresees “globalization” in its descrip-
tion of a capitalist class for whom “the cheap
prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery
with which it batters down all Chinese w .”
They come to understand that this revolutionary
relic of early capitalism is prescient enough to
have something to say about the
nature of capitalism even now.

Spare me the letters about the
“failure of Marxism,” the “end of
history,” ad nauseam. In the bright
new Russia of the Western banks, 40
percent of the population lives in poverty. On a
global scale, according to just-released United

_Nations and World Health Organization devel-

opment reports, the cost of guaranteeing univer-
sal education, basic health care, nutrition, clean
water and safe sewers to the world’s entire pop-
ulation would be roughly $40 billion annually.
This means that the world’s 225 richest people
alone have enough wealth to feed, provide water
to, educate and medicare everyone on-earth for
the next 25 years, even as 1.3 billion people sur-
vive on less than a dollar a day.

One—quarter of children live in poverty in

the United States, which is technically the

wealthiest country on earth. But 40 percent of the
nation’s wealth is controlled by 1 percent of its
population; about the same amount is owned by
the bottom 92 percent of its population. And this
is the system we are supposed to believe is a suc-
oess. There must be something better, which is

why acertaindeterrninedspecterstill haunts the

__'.,-d-v"J"‘ ‘ ‘

world, even after 150 years.

THE PITT, NEWS: OPINIONS

‘I3

I really don’! like Christmas

Mark Campbell

Columnlst I
I have a bit of a confession to make. I

I really don’t like Christmas.

It has nothing to dowith being cynical
or jaded or any of the things I’m supposed
to be as a college student. '

The truth is, ,_I’ve never really liked it.‘
Even as a child, I saw it as an interruption of
my daily schedule. I’d wake up one mom-
ing, and all of a sudden my house would be
home to a bunch of “relatives.” (I was never
really sure I was related to any of them
because Christmas was the only time I_ever
saw them. And I still want a blood test done
on that guy who kept telling me to pull his
ﬁnger.) '

The excitement of seeing all ‘those pre-
sents under- the tree was never there for me.
I was some sort of freak child I always
knew that Santa was just some guy in a suit
making minimum wage and that I’d see
him outside the mall taking a smoke break
and hitting on the elves in 15 minutes. It’s
kind of sad, really.

Christmas has always looked good in
theory but has fallen apart in reality. Sort of
like communism but with a better sound-
track. All that family togetherness sounds

really, really heartwarming —— until you
have to eat dinner with them. At that point,
you remember why the relatives only come
over once a year. And it’s a really nice thing
to give generously, until the credit card bill
shows up. In other words, chestnuts roast-
ing on an open ﬁre really stink up the house
when they burn, and Jack -
Frost nipping at your nose
is not a pleasing sensa-
tion. — .
Now that I’m older "
and in a position to 
about things, I’m begin-
ning to realize why’ I’ve
never had that joy, joy, joy,
joy down in my heart.
Christmas is just the same
damn sociopolitical night-
mare year after year. _
Every year, I get to watch the same religious

types implore the public to “putthe Christ V

back in Christmas” while the capitalists
implore the public to buy Taiwanese plastic
nativity scenes in exciting bright colors for
50 percent oif at Wal—Mart. And the "funny
thing is that they don’t realize that they need
each other to ﬁmction. The religious types
need the capitalists in order to get that warm
feeling that comes with giving a really nice

 

gift, and the capitalists need religious types
to buy said gifts.

I have the utmost respect for people
with the “true spirit of Christmas,” whatev-
er their idea of that is. But the truth is that
most people see it as an obligation these

days. And they claim that it’s a really spiri—_

tual thing for them. They
give to the man with the
bell and the kettle, and it’s
“the Christmas Spirit.”
Giving makes ‘ them feel
good inside. True, but
doesn’t it do that the rest
of the year, too? Or is it
just for a couple of weeks
in December? Let’s be
honest — it’s not the
Christmas spirit; it’s guilt.
, I do it, too. Spending an
hour in the mall maxing out the Visa makes
you realize how much you actually have.
You walk o11t of the mall, and tlrere’s ﬂre
guy with the bell. And it makes you sick to
your stomach that you have so much.

Why should this be just a Christmas
phenomenon? The have and have-not situa-
tion doesn’t stop from January to
November. There are thousands of worthy
charities that need help the whole year. It’s

  Hangin’ outwith seedy Santa Clauses  

Stephen May

Columnist

It’s December once again, and the holi-
day season is upon us. This, of course, means
that Christmas lights of all sizes and colors
are out, ﬂashing and pulsating, making a
neighborhood near you look like some kind
of suburban Las Vegas strip.

And, of course, all the shopping centers
are packed

And, of course, there are seedy Santas
everywhere.

I don’t think I was ever willing to sit on
a seedy Santa’s lap as a child I just never
ﬂrought for a second that the very same
Santa that made a point of sneaking down
my chimney every Christmas morning
would agree to sit in a fake sleigh in an old
hardware store and have Polaroid pictures
taken of himself.

So every year until I was about 5, my
dad (who never seemed to learn his lesson)
plopped me kicking and screaming onto
Santa’s lap (which was always already par-
tially occupied by Santa’s beer gut).

Santa always asked me what I wanted
for Christmas, and I never replied My dad
always tried to coax me into talking  and
after a while, I always said something like “a
truck” just to end the torturous alfair.

It was probably just as horrible for the
seedy Santa as it was for me. He was the one,
after all, who had to entertain screaming,
rmwilling child after screaming, unwilling
child and somehow remain smiling and

“jolly.”

But Santa did have it pretty good com-
pared to the poor “reindeer” that the hard-
ware store kept in an attached barn. T'hat’s
another column entirely, ﬂrough.

And the seedy Santas who get to sit in
fake sleighs generally have it pretty good
compared to the seedy volunteer Santas; the

breed of Santa who volunteers to stand out-

side in the cold in front of K—Marts across the
nation in the name of charity and/or fraud. ~

Those true—blue for-charity Santas have
very big hearts, and I know so because I
once stood next to one, in the cold, in ﬁont
of a K—Mart for a few hours.

I was frurd raising for my high school’s C

freshman hockey team. I’m not sure exactly
what the seedy volunteer Santa’s charity
was, but I do think he was legitimate. He
might have been a Mason. Or a Shriner.

We were standing there for a while 1

before the conversation started ﬂowing. I, as
a matter of personal policy, don’t talk to

someone unless that person talks to me ﬁrst. ’

Unless I’ve been drinking.

Iwas only 13, so Ihadn’tbeen drinking.
Ever. And so the conversation didn’t start
until Santa started it.

“It’s cold outside,” I drink he said

I thought aboutpossible responses. The
obvious “I thought you were from the North
Pole” passed ﬂirough my mind, but I decid-
ed to stick with a standard, “Yeah”

“TJ. hockey, huh?” Santa grunted TJ.
was the high school thatl went to, and I was
wearing a T.J. hockey coat.

The only possible response was “yeah.”
“You a hockey player?” Santa grunted.
The only possible response was “yeah.”

Not surprisingly, the seedy volunteer
Santa lost interest in me and rang his bell.a
few times. Passers-by, K—Mart customers on
their way to a blue-light special or the K-
Mart cafeteria (which was still providing K-
Mart customers with ﬁne _ meals back in
those days) put money in my cup or in his
cup. A few generous or ostentatious cus-
tomers put money in both of our cups.

We did OK, I guess. But I think I might
have made a little more than Santa. Probably
because I didn’t look seedy.

After a while, the seedy volunteer Santa
remembered I was there. “It’s rough getting
up on.these Saturday mornings, huh?”

The only possible response was “y .”

. Santa put his bell down, reached into a
pocket, and pulled ‘out two candy canes.

“You wanna candy cane?”

“Yeah,” I said, even though I didn’t
actually want one.

It was almost time for me to go.

“I’m just about out of here,” I said

VV1th that, the seedy volunteer Santa
reached into his pocket again. This time, he
pulled out a dollar bill. _

“Here you go,” he said, putting the dol-
lar bill in my cup. “Merry Christmas.”

And the only possible response was
“Thanks. Merry Christmas to you, too.”

Stephen May hopes that’ this wasn ’t a cheesy

Christmas column. .

downright hypocritical to recognize this fact
at Clrristrnastime yet not during the rest of
the year. Don’t claim that it’s some sort of
spiritual event when you put your change
into the Salvation Army kettle if you’re only
doing it because it’s Christmas. It’s insulting
to those for whom the holiday really does
have some meaning, and it irks those of us
who realize that giving should happen more
than once a year. '
So I guess that’s_ why...I have issues with
Christmas. I should point out that I do like
certain aspectsof the holiday just so I don’t
sound like a complete Scrooge. For starters,
I really love Christmas music except for that
Bing Crosby version of “Adeste Fideles”

that seems to be so popular in department -

stores. Seriously, the man sounds like he’s
undergoing gallstone surgery while under
really heavy sedation. I really, really like
rum balls and shiny objects.'Christrnastime
seems to be full of boﬂr. And what can I
say? There’s something about a bright fuch-
sia baby Jesus that just appeals to my par-
ticular aesthetic sensibilities.

Ten seconds of mayhem for Pitt

Brad Cuprik
Staff Wrlter

There was nothing to say after
Pitt’s disappointing loss to Connecticut
on Saturday afternoon that would make
any of the Panthers feel better. Isaac
Hawkins reiterated this when asked
what the locker room was like after the
shock wore off.

“Silence,”
“Silence.”

In the other locker room, however,
there was anything but.

After Khalid El-Amin got done

showing the Pitt faithful exactly what
he thought of being called, “fat boy,”
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun pulled

Hawkins replied,

 

screaming and waving the towels given
to them before the game. Fitzgerald
Field House was about to become the
site of the biggest win in Panther histo-
ry. In the 10 seconds that the referee
gathered the ball after the traveling
violation and gave it to Isaac Hawkins
to inbound, the Panthers’ chances of
winning were sucked outside the build-
ing and onto Alequippa Street.

Ricardo Greer made one of two
free throws after being fouled, and Pitt
had a four-point lead with a dozen sec-
onds on the clock.

. “[The Panthers’] body language
showed me that they didn’t think they
were going to lose,” said Calhoun.

It would have taken a small mira-
cle for the,Huskies to win.

Losing has become a disease with
the Panthers when it comes to big
games in the Big East Conference. A
painful one. Players shed tears in the
locker room after the game.

Pitt coach Ralph Willard is still
convinced his team is capable of win-
ning. these types of games.

“It was a war out there,” Willard

said. “A physical war.”

Pitt didn’t lose the war, but it lost a
tough battle.

Panther fans were asked to wear white for Saturday's game and responded
in droves, packing Fitzgerald Field House to yell and scream for the Panthers.

up half an hour early, pick up. my press pass

I knew the Pitt vs. No. 1 Connecticut
game on that day was sold out and that
Fitzgerald Field House wouldﬁll up early,
so I thought I’d show up around 10:45 or 11
am. for the noon game — for which I decid-
ed to sit in the stands so I could cheer outside
of the media stoicism I’m usually forced to
watch games within.

Instead, I had to work another
job until 11:15, and I wouldn’t be
able to show up until 11:20. I ﬁg-
ured I’d still get a decent seat,
though: I mean, most of the games
I attend are vacant until about ﬁve
minutes before tip-oli

I never could have been more wrong.

My friend and I walked into an obvi-
ously ﬁlled—beyond-capacity Field House

One hell of a game in two facets: the

THE Prr'r Naws

Reflection  Panther Iieci rlbrea ks

 

Saturday, the sound returned. . A .
Sitting quietly in front of my room-
mate’s computer, I banged away at the
last long paper I’d ever write as a student
at this ﬁne school. It was 1:57 p.m.,

according to the little clock in the comer _

of the monitor.
Then I heard the scream.
It came from the house two doors

down. It shook the windows. It rattled the ,
ﬂoors. It caught me right in the middle of 

"as very insightful sentence concerning the
behavior of currency traders in respect to
the Malaysian government

I had heard the sound before, and I
knew exactly what to do.

I turned on the television to conﬁnn
my suspicions: The Pitt Panther basket-
ball team had just dropped a one-point
heartbreaker to the Connecticut Huskies.

Immediately, the ﬂashbacks started.
Three years ago, the scream came from
across the fourth ﬂoor of Tower A, as the

. Panther hoopsters ﬁnished off an _over—

time loss to tl1en—No. 1 UMass.

In 1996, it came from all over the
city, reacting to Neil O’Donnell’s 36th
interception in the annual January mas-
sacre known as the Super Bowl.

The scream skipped a year in 1997;
the loudest yelling in the Pitt sports world
came from beneath my seat in the football
press box, as thousands of students staged
a mini-riot, thanks to Pitt’s Homecoming
upset over the Miami Hurricanes.

I haven’t asked the guy two doors
down if he’s been the one doing all the

screaming. I guess it’s a possibility, but .

when you live on the wrong side of North
Oakland’s tracks, talking to the neighbors
can be a bit of an insurance risk.

Memories of plaintive wails past are
what sportswriters are all about.

People don’t read sports stories to get
statistics, to ﬁnd out key performers, or
even to discover the winners or losers. For
readers who missed the game itself, sto-
ries re-create the images, using the
English language in a vain attempt to
describe the emotion surrounding either
athletic triumph or, for example, a one-
point loss to UConn.

Readers who attended the game
already know the score. They saw the key
players play, watched the coaches’ coach,
and sat silently as Khalid El—Amin
drained a last-second bucket, then jumped
on the nearest table and started screaming
at the Panther faithful.

They are reading for an immediate

ﬂashback of their experience. They want 
to know how writers could possiblyf’.

They tell me that thanks to a
December graduation, I can’t provide any
more recall for this newspaper. , While
nothing is ever ﬁnal (I’m sure I have
enough credits. I think. Maybe.
Deﬁnitely. Most deﬁr1itely.), I’m guessing
it’s about time to give up on the fun of a

college paper and concentrate on full-time
headaches at my job at the nearby subur-
ban weekly. ‘

But the ﬂashbacks will stay forever.
Remember the last time Pitt had Midnight
Madness? Remember watching the
Panther hoops team demolish New
Orleans in the ﬁrst round of the‘ 1997
NIT? V

Remember Beale Street in Memphis?
Remember jamming Pitt Stadium to
watch the Panthers scare the heck out of
Penn State?

Remember rushing in and out of the
Carrier Dome so fast that you nearly
destroyed the complicated compressed-
air equilibrium that keeps the structure

and aches-

standing?

If you are a long-time Panther fan,
you’ll never forget any of those things.
Except the last one, but that’s really my
personal legal headache.

More than likely, you’ve already for-
gotten who recalled them in the next day’s
paper. Here’s a hint: He's the one writer
who, for the past three and one-half years,
has never, ever had a good-looking
colunmist photo.

Well, you can’t fault the photogra-
phers, considering what they have to
work with. 4

Women to spend holidays out ‘West

Dan Sauder
Staff Wrlter

The Lady Panther basketball
team will be spending its holiday in
Oakland. Well, sort of. It will actual-
ly be participating in the Oakland
Tribune Classic in’ California, not
Pittsburgh.

After last week’s win against Big
East foe Seton Hall, the Panthers
hope to continue on the winning
track with a victory over the
University of California. The Golden
Bears are their first matchup in the
tournament, which begins on Dec. 20
at 6 p.m. Just before this game,
Colorado State will meet Wake
Forest. The consolation game
between the two losing teams will be
held on Dec. 21, at 2 p.m. with the
championship game immediately fol-
lowing.

First-year Lady Panther coach
Traci "W3,-ites is familiar with the
PAC-10"’-Golden Bears, having faced
them during her days as an assistant
coach at Arizona.

California has a record of 2-2,

with its wins coming against Pacific »

and San Francisco. Its two losses
came against Virginia and the Ohio
State, a team which the Panthers also
lost to on Dec. 2. California has one
more game before the tournament

begins. It will play Northwestern‘

Dec. 17.

The other matchup in the first
round of the tournament is Wake
Forest against Colorado State.
Colorado State has proven itself a
difficult opponent, going 10-0 so far
this season and earning a No. 11
ranking in the Associated Press poll.
It also has the 23rd-ranked offense in
the country.

The Lady Panthers are hoping to

celebrate the holiday season by walk— I

ing away with another tournament
championship. They won the
Pittsburgh Panther Invitational, beat-
ing out Robert Morris and Miami
(Ohio) in their first two games of the
season. They went on to win their
next two games, going 4-0 for the
first time in 16 years.

After their early success, the
Panthers faltered a bit, losing to Ohio
State and Duquesne. Regardless of
what happens at the Oakland Tribune
Classic, the Panthers need to be pre-
pared immediately following the hol-
iday ' break for tough matchups
against Miami on Jan. 2, St. John’s
on Jan. 5 and the No. 1 Connecticut
on Jan. 7. All 17 of their regu1ar-sea-
son games following the break are
against Big East opponents, and the
Big East Tournament is set to begin
on Feb. 27.

Pitt gets heavyweight win over Bloomsburg, 23-12

Brian Knavish

O09000OOOOOOO_

Assistant Sports Editor
Heavyweight Matt Mueller’s pin

L over Bloomsburg’s Phil Yeizk did more

than just help Pitt lock up a 22-12 win
Thursday night.

It ﬁred up the 250—pound monster,
juiced up his Panther teammates, and
ignited the Fitzgerald Field House crowd

so much that this win could give Pitt a,

jolt of momentum that carries through
the rest of the season.

“It’s big,” head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said of the pin. “ It lights up
the crowd. It’s the TKO, the slam dunk.-
It’s what we set out to do in this sport.”

When Mueller took the mat on
Thursday night, Pitt was clinging to a 13-
12 lead. Bloomsburg had the momentum,
winning the two previous matches to
close the gap to one.

If Mueller had lost, Pitt’s chances of
winning would have been seriously jeop-
ardized since just one other match
remained. 1

But Mueller exploded onto the mat.
He manhandled Yeizk, immediately tak-
ing him down and almost collecting the
pin just 30 seconds into the match.

Yeizk managed to avoid the early
pin, but Mueller stayed aggressive and
eventually collected the fall as the buzzer

rang to end the first period, giving ‘Pitt six
team points and making the score 18-12.

It was more than just Mueller’s effort
that ensured the Pitt victory. Several
Panthers stepped up unexpectedly to
make up for other upset Pitt losses.

“If somebody would have told me
before that [Chad] Jesko and [Dan] Stine
would lose but we would win as handily

_ as we did, I would have told them they

were crazy,” Stottlemyer said.

The match started at the 133-pound
weight class, where sophomore Shawn
Amistade managed a 6-3 minor decision
victor to give Pitt an early 3-0 lead. ‘

But the Huskies bounced right back,
picking up two minor decision victories.
Pitt’s Chris DeGuiseppe dropped a 9-2
match to Bloomsburg’s Brett Tullo,
while. Jesko lost 4-2 to Bloomsburg’s
George Carter in the night’s biggest
upset. .
At 149 pounds, Pitt senior Mike
Ziska pulled out a last-second takedown
to give him a major decision victory (a
win by eight or more points). Stottlemyer
explained that the major decision gar-
nered Pitt one extra tearn point, which
could have been huge had Pitt lost anoth-
er match.

“Had we lost somewhere else, Mike
really hustling to get that extra point
could have meant the whole match,” he

said. *
Pitt senior Brian Pardini (165) and
sophomore Nick Mengerink (174) each
picked up minor decision wins to boost
Pitt’s lead to 13-6.

Mengerink, who is currently ranked
third in the nation at 174, was hampered
by a hand injury that has kept him out of
action most of this season. He explained

that his hand is sore, which limited his

ability in the match.

Bloomsburg made it close again with
two minor decision victories at 184 and
197 before Mueller’s pin at heavyweight.

MICHELE JOHNSON/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Brian Legarth won Pitt’s last match in its win over Bloomsburg Thursday.

That pin meant that all 125-pounder
Brian Legarth had to do to win was not
get pinned, but he did much more than
that._ Legarth defeated Bloomsburg’s
Russ Witt 11-6, officially clinching the
Panther victory and leaving everyone in
the Field House with the warm holiday
feeling of victory.

' The wrestling team won’t take much

' of a break over Christmas. On Dec. 29-

30, the starters will go to the prestigious
Midlands Toumament, while the backups
will gain experience at the Wilkes
Tournament.

The Twelve Days of Christmas, sports style

The holiday season is upon us, and
so is the last edition of The Pitt News
this year. The sports staff got together
for our last production night to make a
list of our “Twelve Days of Christmas.”

Some of you may prefer the
Muppets or “Old Blue Eyes” Frank

Sinatra singing the song, but all we _

have to offer is our own rendition. _

On the 12th day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to "us  12
drummers drumming.

Kudos to the Pitt band. They were
the only thing worth listening to
throughout the end of the football sea-
son.
On the 11th day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  11
inept Steelers. .

The offense sucks. It is more than
inept. We have to give the defense
credit, though. Guess we’ll have to
wait until next year for the five Super
Bowl rings.

On the 10th day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us ...’10
wrestlers wrestling.

The wrestling team gives Pitt its
strongest chance at a national champi-
on this winter. ,

On the ninth day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  nine
pinstriped Yankees.

Yeah, they’re really good, if you

didn’t- hear already. They won every-
thing, including the World Series. No
kidding. Thanks for that!

On the eighth day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  eight
rugby players. V

Well, they’re really for our copy
editor, but we had to give her some-
thing for all of her hard work. Enjoy,
Lauren.

On‘ the seventh day of
Christmas, the sports
world gave to us 
seven Panther home
games. 1
They did us no
good, but that did-
n’t matter. We
were all excited
about the home
games until the
team did a little
worse than
expected.

On the sixth
day of Christmas, the
sports world gave to us 
Sixth Man T-shirts.

Another great idea by the Pitt ath-
letics department. It packed the “hi2-
zouse” for the UConn game, and the
was rockin’ and
rollin’. Look for those white shirts to
pop up around campus as the hoops

team keeps improving.

On the ﬁfth day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  ﬁve
Golden Girls.

OK, the sports staff didn’t really
get this, but we’re hoping. They did
win some kind of championship or

something last

year but we real-

ly weren’t pay-

' ing that much

attention. We

were eating in

the press box and

watching them

twirl the day
away.

0 n
the fourth
day of
Christmas, the
s p o r t s

world gave
to us
four awful experts.
Lilley won, but the rest
of us really sucked. We thorough-
ly embarrassed ourselves, so we hope
you didn’t trust us.

On the third day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  three
men in the backﬁeld.

Brandon Williams, Kevan Barlow
and Ike Williams did their best to make

  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 

 

the Panther offense go,’ but behind a
weak line, not too much happened. We
hope that next year we’ll get three big
offensive linemen to help our three run-
ning backs.

On thesecond day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  two
football victories. 6

Couldn’t the sports world have V

done any better? Really, only two wins
— we guess they’re getting a little
cheap, but we know not to complain
about gifts we get. Maybe next year

we’ll ask for an undefeated season in '

hopes of seven or eight victories.

On the ﬁrst day of Christmas,
the sports world gave to us  one
NBA lockout.

Thank goodness for that. We don’t
have to listen to whiny millionaires.
Well, we still do, but we don’t have to
watch them deface the game of basket-
ball.

« As a special addition to the song,
we can’t forget Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa, but there just weren’t
enough days!

The sports staff would like to wish
you and yours good luck on ﬁnals and
a wonderful holiday season. We will
see you back next semester with some
new faces and some old. Keep hoping
for that tournament bid! LET’S GO
DANCING!

 FROM PAGE 1
Isaac Hawkins or Attila Cosby was
to be the safety man on the play: the
player designed to‘ get the ball if the
guards can’t get free.

Cummings did not see anyone‘

open on the ﬂoor after the double
screen, so he lobbed the ball to the
middle of the ﬂoor.

No one was near the ball, and it
ﬂoated into the backcourt. With
eight seconds remaining, UConn
picked up the ball and drove down
the floor. .

The pass came into the paint to
El-Amin, who buried a turnaround.
jump shot over two Panthers to give
the Huskies their one-point win.

This was the first time Pitt did
not hold the lead since the first half.

To start the game, the Huskies
took an 11-7 lead before Pitt came
back on a three-pointer and an assist
from Taylor at the 13:50 mark to tie
the game at 12.

By the 7:47 mark, Pitt had built
a 26-19 lead over the top-ranked
Huskies.

With 1:42 in the half, Pitt

regained the lead, after being down
34-30, on a jumper by Hawkins and
a three-pointer by Jarrett Lockhart.

Lockhart was the dominant force
in the first half with 19 points.

“Lockhart had 19 points without
dribbling,” UConn coach Jim
Calhoun said.

During most of the first half,
Lockhart, who averages 12 points
per game, was able to stand and wait
for his teammates to get him the
ball. .

“I kind of felt it in the first half,”
Lockhart said of his shooting touch.

Lockhart scored four more down
the stretch to give Pitt its five-point
halftime advantage.

The second half started about the
same with a three-point play by
Greer off of a Souleymane Wane
foul and a layup by Vonteego
Cummings.

Cummings was quiet most of the
game, shooting only 2-18 from the
field and scoring just six points.

With 16:44 left in the game, Pitt
had built a 48-35 lead, outscoring
UConn 18-1 from 2:38 remaining in
the first half until the beginning of
the second.

The Huskies kept chipping away,
especially without Cummings shoot-
ing well.

“He’s in a little bit of a slump.
‘Struggle’ is probably very mild in
terms of offense,” Willard said.

UConn-kept fighting back until
the Huskies gave themselves a
chance to win at the end of the
game.
