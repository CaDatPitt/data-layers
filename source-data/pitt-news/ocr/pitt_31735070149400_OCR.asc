t Pitt ﬁles lawsuit against

Pitt ﬁled a lawsuit against the

_ Big East Conference on Friday in Al- 1

» legheny =County.Court_ i_‘r_1'an' effort to- - --
quicken its departure to the Atlantic 0
Coast Conferenceone season earlier »

than permitted by the Big East.
At the root of the lawsuit is the
Big East’s permission for Texas
Christian’ University and West
Virginia’ University‘ to depart
early from the conference for the
Big 12. Pitt, which announced its
intentions to move to the ACC in
September, is claiming that the
Big East surrendered its right to
enforce the 27-month withdrawal
notice because it did not hold WVU
and TCU,-who only announced their
departures last October, to the same
standards as Pitt.

Pitt’s lawsuit
On Sept. 26, 2011, Pitt notiﬁed-

the Big East that it would be with-
drawing from the conference. Pitt"

paid-half of the $5 million exit fee ,

at that time and also agreed to stay
in the conference untiljuly 1, 2014.

Now, however, the University wants _

to depart earlier.
Pitt athletics department
spokesman E.J. Borghetti issued

a statement from the University -

on Friday concerning the 34—page
lawsuit brought by Pitt, saying that

there has been ongoing discussion .

between the. athletics department
and conference officials concerning
Pitt’s departure from the Big East.
Former Big East Commissioner
John Marinatto and Pitt Athletics

Director Steve Pederson met re-

cently to go over the matter, and
there were hints that Pitt would be

    

able to,take.i'tsleave‘early. _ o

-But according to Pitt, subse-‘ ‘

quent efforts to try and move for-
ward with the clepartu.r,.e_haV€_b€€f1,

unsu’cc’esfsful,* ‘University-oﬂiicials, _ ,
state that:M.arinatto claimed that -

Pitt would have to stay’ in the con-
ference through the 2013-2014 sea-
son. Marinatto resigned on May 7,
andjoseph Bailey III,has since taken
over as interim commissionen; , ‘A
“Since the University of Pitts-
burgh made the decision to join
the Atlantic Coast Conference, we
have done everything possible to
move through a smooth transition
with the Big East,” Borghetti said
in the statement. “Though we have
been excluded from governance ac-
tivities, meetings, decision-making

and operations functions of the ‘

conference, we have been positive
and respectﬁil of the Big East.”

The Big East said it is working
with Pitt to try and ﬁx the prob-
lem. Conference spokesman John
Paquette referred to-his quote in
the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette on Sat-
urday as the conference’s statement
on the matter.

“We have stated previously that
The Big East would be open tothe
possibility for Pitt to depart after
the [2012-2013] season and have
reached out to Pitt regarding its is-

sue,” Paquette said. “Pitt’s ﬁling of .

a lawsuit is a disappointing action.”

Pitt is also asking for unspeciﬁed
monetary damages. This includes
more than $500,000 in buyout and
game fees from when TCU left the
conference and about $250,000 in
reparations paid to Central Flor-

Forbes Avenue early Friday morning.
Accordingto city police, the gim-
ﬁght resulted from an attempted rob-

bery outside McD0nald’ .
S Around 2:40 a.m., Jason “Jiggy”

,Woodall, 18, of McKees Rocks, Pa.,

attempted to rob a 23-year-old man
from Pittsburgh’s Momingside neigh-
borhood of abracelet at gunpoint.
The 23-year-old pulled out a legally

registered‘ and licensed handgun in

response and the two proceeded to

exchange ﬁre. _ ,
. Pitt, spokesmanjohn Fedele said
the gunﬁght took place outside The
Original Hot Dog Shop on the corner
ofForbes Avenue and Bouquet Street.

‘Woodall was taken into custody ‘
following the incident, in which the

other man was shot in the stomach.
Woodall was grazed by a bullet and

at Heinz Field this season to allow .

room for TCU on Pitt’s schedule.
It also includes a $320,000 fee
to Gardner-Webb University, which
took 'TCU’s spot on the schedule
after the university departed from

Q the Big East. Pitt claims there will be

a negative effect on game—ticket and
season—ticket sales for the replace-
ment game with Gardner-Webb,
which Pitt called a “less attractive
and valuable opponent from a lower
division as a result of the loss of
the TCU. game on short notice” in
the lawsuit. _ _
Syracuse, which also announced
it was leaving the Big East in Sep-
tember, will not join in on Pitt’s law-
suit against the conference.
“We’ve been trying to resolve
the issue of conference transition
with the Big East,” Syracuse Ath-

letic Director Daryl Gross said on
Tuesday. “We’d like to avoid litiga-
tion, but we’re keeping all of our
options open.”

Big East reconﬁgurations

Pitt isn’t the ﬁrst school to slap a
lawsuit on the Big East for not allow-
ing it to leave. At the core of the Big
East’s troubles is its inability to hold
onto schools, resulting in a domino
effect of other schools leaving for
other conferences.

On Sept. 17, 2011, Pitt and Syra-
cuse applied to join the ACC.

That same month, the Universi-
ty of Connecticut said it was seeking
to join the ACC because the Big East
was starting to appear less viable. ‘

TCU said in 2010 it-would‘ join
the Big East for the’2012-2013 sea-

V son, but the school rescinded that

statement on Oct. 10, 2011, and, in
another blow to the Big East, went
to the Big 12 for this upcoming sea-
son. The school had a quick and

clean departure because it wasn’t
yet a member of the conference and
didn’t have to pay the $5 million
exit fee. 4 ‘

WVU, after watching competi-

   Daryl Gross  

tiori dwindle in the conference, ac-
cepted an invitation to join the Big
12 on Oct. 28, 2011. V

But WVU’s transition also came

with a university lawsuit, followed
by a countersuit from the Big East.

On Oct. 31, 2011, WVU ﬁled a
lawsuit against the Big East. Cen-
tral to that lawsuit was the possible
departure of Pitt, the University of
Connecticut and TCU, which WVU

-said damaged the quality of com-

petition among the conference’s
football—playing schools. UConr_1
maintains that it will remain with
Big East for the time being.

“This lack of leadership, breach
of ﬁduciary duties by the Big East
and its commissioner, and voting
disparity between the football and
non—football schools resulted in the
Big East football conference no lon-
ger being a viable and competitive

football conference,” the lawsuit
’e stated. ’ T

_ The Big East ﬁled a counter law-
suit against WVU on Nov. 4, 2011, in
an attempt to force the university

to comply with the conference’s

bylaws by claiming a breach of
contract.

The two parties ultimately
reached an out-of-court settle-’
ment that resulted in the univer-
sity paying an unspeciﬁed amount
of money and being released from
the waiting period for leaving the
Big East. ‘

The Big East had to scramble
recently to rebuild the conference
after three of its main members --
Syracuse, Pitt and WVU —,—. bolted
for different conferences. In order
to maintain the strength of compel-
tition available in the conference
and thereby keep its BCS automatic-

qualiﬁer status, it brought in Boise-

State, Houston, Memphis, Navy,
San Diego State, Southern Method-
ist University,i'Temple and‘Univer-
sity of Central Florida.
“Beginning with the 2013-2014

' season, the Big East will actually

have four more football—playing
schools and more schools overall
than when we gave notice that we
were moving to a difference confer-

    Jen: awarded $1.3 million in  
gremgts for nuclear energy reseezrc/4

When professorjohn Metzger.be-
gan his tenure as director of Pitt’s
nuclear engineering program in
2010, the certificate program
focused primarily on academ-
ics, placing little emphasis on
research. .

In the two years of his lead-
ership, the nuclear engineer-
ing department considerably
increased its propensity for re-

search, increasing enrollment in .

its graduate program. Last week,
Metzger’s work‘won Pitt grants
totaling $1.3 million from the U.S.

Department of Energy. Through»

the Department of Energy’s Nu-
clear Energy University Program,
Metzger, fellow Pitt professor
Mark Kimber and Pitt graduate
student Rita Patel each received
funding for their respective proj-
ects developing new technology

_ for nuclear energy that could

make the process safer.

The NEUP focuseson the in— c

tegration of researchand devel-
opment at universities, national
laboratories and industry and
on revitalizing nuclear_ educa-
tion in the country, according
to the Department of Energy’s
website. The NEUP also provides
funding for the improvement of
nuclear research infrastructure
on college campuses by improv-
ing their research, development
and educational capacities.

Metzger said the NEUP pro-
gram provides funding for re-
search on energy capabilities
of nuclear power rather than its
use in national defense. For his
own research, Metzger received
a grant of $900,000 to fund sev-
eral projects. ’

‘ In_ his first project, Metzger
teamed with professorjon Long-
tin of Stony-Brook University to
developed a systemthat would
provide.,.p_ower for emergency

backup systems in the case of 7

‘a meltdown at a nuclear power

_ plant. Nuclear meltdowns are

catastrophic accidents that re-
sult from nuclear reactors over-

‘ heating, as happened famously

in the Chernobyl and Fukushima
disasters.
“[We’re] using thermoelec-

. tries to power sites in the case of

meltdown,” Metzger said. “These
could potentially charge batteries
that operate safety—class valves.-”

Metzger said, that the te-
chonology is essentially a back-
up power supply ‘forreactors. In
the case of Fukushima, the plant
lost energy, resulting in the melt-

down‘. Metzger said hiscback-up

system could ‘prevent that. Along

By collaborating with Pitt’s radiology

received in NEUP grants.

Mark Kimber, an assistant profes-
sor in Pitt’s mechanical engineering and

fect the core of a gas reactor’s structural

“We are developing tools to better pre-
dict the generation and transport of heat
in the next generation of nuclear reac-
tors,” Kimber said. According to Metzger,

‘ Kimber’s research could help develop a

method to test nuclear reactors at very
high temperatures.

V First-year engineering graduate stu-
dent Rita Patel also received funding'for
herresearch and development plan. The

N EUP has a separate fellowship program. .

for graduate engineering students.

Patel was among 31 students nation-
wide who received an annual $50,000 sti-
pend over the next three years. The NEUP

fellowship includes a $5,000 research sti-
pend toward a summer internship at the
national research laboratory.

She said in an email that she originally
proposed research based on her work as a

senior undergraduate student last year at ‘

Pitt. She said her work involved studying
the energies of grain boundaries of line
pipe steel.

Patel also said she filed this proposal
before she decided to attend graduate
school at Pitt and that her final proposal
will focus more closely on nuclear engi-
neering.

“I will be working on research related
to the oxidation of metal alloys with my
advisor, Dr. [Gerald] Meier,” Patel said.
“This can be related to nuclear engineering

in a variety of ways. The simplest is that
the casing of the reactors used in nuclear
power plants is partially made from dif-
ferent kinds of alloys, which experience
oxidation and radiation under use.”

Her work would help develop metal al-
loys that could better withstand the wear

put on them by oxygen and radiation, both ’

of which can’ undermine the integrity of
the metals. -  y A . i :3 

For Metzger, Pitt receiving the NEUP
grants speaks volumes toward the progress
made by the nuclear engineering program
since the program’s inception.

“We’re trying to build the nuclear en-
gineering program here, and [the grants
were] a signiﬁcant development for this
school,” Metzger said. I

Rosie McKin1ey,jbr The Pitt News

Coming—outs can be surprising.
Last week, the country was

surprised when President Barack

Obama came out insupport of the

legalizatioln of gay marriage. De- '

spite being a socially liberal presi-
dent, his previously ambiguous sup-
port toward gay marriage made his
outright declaration unexpected.
The announcement was particularly
surprising because of the impend-
ing election, as his new stance could
lose voters 4 especially in swing

states thathave laws banning gay

marriage, such as Pennsylvania.

Another state outlawing gay
marriage is Kentucky. And it is in
Kentucky —- a historically Repub-
lican state —— that Obama might
surprisingly ﬁnd others like him.
South of the Mason-Dixon Line,
the president is just another unex-
pected supporter of the marriage
equality movement.

Of course, I discovered this all
by accident.

Kentucky, as it turns out, is only
seven hours away from Pittsburgh.
All that separates us from the blue-
grass state is really just a sliver of
West Virginia and about 200 miles
of Ohio pavement. Armed with
Google Maps printouts and dream-
ing of handsome southern frat boys,
my roommates and I jumped in
my mother’s old SUV. and headed
southwest for the Kentucky Derby
at the Churchill Downs.

Nine hours and several missed
turns later, we pulled into a Waffle
House parking lot just outside of
Louisville. Over grits and biscuits
we celebrated our successful drive

. and prepared for the next segment

of the journey: getting into the in-
ﬁeld for the Kentucky Derby.

As rookies to the Triple Crown
and horseracing in general, we were

unsure of everything -- all we knew
was to pack some large hats. Vari-
ous YouTube clips of the inﬁeld and

years of watching the race on televi— .

sion had established in our minds
only that the scenewould include
ﬂowing bourbon and a large num-
ber of people in sundresses. But not
even our tickets guaranteed that
we would see any horses. The only
guarantee was that our ﬁrst trip to
the Kentucky Derby would be a day
full of surprises.

The ﬁrst surprise came early, at
the gates. Positioned in front of the
entrance to the derby grounds was a
group of fundamentalist Christians
protesting the gambling, drinking
and general debauchery in which
the rest of us were about to happily
engage. The "group threw various
epithets at us. I was left wondering

dential elections over the last half century

—— and given the particularly acidic context of ,

contemporary American politics —— I wasn’t

surprised by the abrasive presence of this A

particular group.

In the South — where ﬁrst cousins can
get married but gays cannot — I was not
surprised when the group’s leader declared
the damnation of all homosexuals. Rather,
the surprise was the reaction of the crowd. In
immediate response to the preacher’s deroga-

tory comments toward gays, the crowd broke _
out in widespread chants for equality. Various ‘

May 16, 20t 2 I The Pitt News I v\/ww.pitthews.eerh

people chanted, “Tolerance for the gays!” One
man dressed in nothing but a leather jacket
and denim shorts shouted from his tobacco-
ﬁlled mouth a request for the preacher to
“Bring yo’ sweet thang over here!”

The people in this crowd were the people
paying afew hours’ wages to get into the mud-
dy inﬁeld, not the 1 percent sitting up in Mil-
lionaire’s Row. These were the people wearing
denim overalls, not Seersucker suits. These
were the people sneaking bourbon in ﬂasks
and at the bottom of coolers, not buying $9
mint juleps in the stands. Indeed, this crowd
was a group of working—class southerners.
These were the people Northemers tend to
stereotype as backward, socially conservative
hicks. Yet here theyywere, openly support-

"ing the very progressive notion of equality
‘r regardless of sexual orientation.

In immediate response
to the preacher’s
derogatory comments
toward gays, the crowd
broke out in widespread
chants for equality.

With North Carolina’s mostrecent passage
of Amendment One,-the South becomes the
only region in the nation where all state con-

stitutions include amendments that ban gay
marriage. Many — like North Carolina and
Kentucky — include passages that also ban
civil unions. In the face of open discrimina-
tion against homosexual couples, we might
become discouraged about the future of our
nation, or even for all humanity. But if the
unexpected support from a group of southern
frat boys and Kentuckians is any indication,
there is reason for hope. For it is unexpect-
ed support against anticipated critics that
propels society forward. While we can be
discouraged by the ignorant preacher, we
can be- far more inspired by his progressive
challengers. Sometimes, those supporters
come from the Oval Ofﬁce. Other times they
come dressed in overalls.

Elizabeth Weisel, Columnist

Despite its many beneﬁts, reading for plea-
sure has become decreasingly popular among
young people over the past few decades. Ac-
cording to a study by the National Endowment,

' ffsubje I . einterested in
to broaden our knowledge about the world. But
even ﬁctionalbooks can expand our vocabulary
or increase ourstorytelling skills. An awareness .
of the more popular works ofliterature can also
deepen our conversational skills and allow us to
discuss literary topics at a more educated level.

2. Relaxation and stress relief

During the summer, all we want to do is

relax and blow off all’ the stress that has built .

up during the semester. What better way to
do that than cuddling on a couch with a good
book and lounging our days away? Instead of
constantly moving around between places and
activities, it serves us well to sit for a while and
get lost in abook. The simple act of sitting still
relaxes our _bodies and minds, allowing us’-to
focus on only one story rather than on avariety
of different things. I 7
3. An escape - ~
Along the same lines as relaxation, reading
for pleasure can provide an escape from the-
monotonous stress of everyday life. Fictioln
books especially can transport their reader into
another world, complete with richly colored

places and events’ that are unlike anything we _
" encounter in real life. Fictional worlds allow us"

to delve into a story for a whilewithout bring-

" ingour real stresses and problems withus.

Our imaginations grow wider when we allow

' ' ourselves -to’ be taken in by a story and closely

   

{ljencounter the characters.

4. Entertainment

, Books can offer the same gripping, exciting
tales that we ﬁnd in movies and on TV without
the mind-numbing screen. Instead of destroy-
ing your eyesight by staring at the TV to get
your ﬁll of entertainment, why not pick up a
book and save yourself from the physical dam-
age? Reading also keeps your mind active while
you’re being entertained rather than letting
your mind sit idly while watching TV. Often-
times, a book will also give a fuller and longer-

" 7 lasting entertainment experience because there

his more room for character development and

intricate story lines in the pages of a book than

in the limited time span of a movie orTV show.
5. Be part of a larger cultural world
Books connect readers to a larger commu-

Books can oﬁer
the same gripping,

nity of people who have read the same books
that they have, especially when the books have
had a broad cultural impact. For example, all
you have to do is mention Harry Potter in a
college classroom and almost every student
can launch into a discussion about the books
and their childhoods. Even great older nov-

els like “To Kill a Mockingbird” orplays like‘ ‘

“Romeo and Juliet” can spark intelligent and
intriguing conversation between’ those’ who

be performing Sunday, May 20,-at _

Heinz»Hall. Earlier in the week, he
spoke with The Pitt News about
his career, comediclstyle and in-
spirations. ‘ "

The Pitt News: I wanted to talk. T

aboutthe beginning of your career.
How did you getpinto comedy?

Brian Regan: I went to college
thinking I was going to be an ac-
countant, and after a number of
weeks of accounting classes, I knew
_I didn’t want to do that. I remember
talking to my head football coach
at.I-Ieidelberg Collegeand he said
you’re "kind of funny on the foot-
ball team, and recommended the
communication and "theater arts

department. I changed majors,‘

and that’s when I decided to be a
comedian.

V TPN: Had people always known
you as a funny guy?

BR: I wasn’t the class clown. I if

was more like the sma1l—circle-of-
friends clown. I was funny,» but I
wasn’t. super" outgoing. It wasn’t

even on my radar that I could be

that I decided on my own while I l U

 Comedy requires a lot of .

intelligence. Your stulf is observa-
tional humor, and that takes skill

V and a lot of intelligence.

BR: Certain kinds of comedy
that some people just chalk up as

Lewis — I» don’t think people re-.
ally understand what’s going on
there. There’s an intelligence to

~ it. It’s more thought—out than you

would'you say it takes for you to
come up with a bit? ‘ . '

BR: Sometimes you come up
with a new idea and you try it on
stage. Let’s say it does work, then
you could spend as long as a year
honing it. You ﬁnd a word that
works 1 percent ‘better or a mo-
ment that works 1 percent better.
You take a little pause here, a little

' pause there, alittle eye gesture that

from night to night makes it a little

TPN: It’s that intricate? A sim-
ple wnrd can change-everything?

BR: Words and the lack of words
are crucial. I had heard years ago
that Rodney Dangerﬁeld used to
take his jokes and take a black
magic marker and scratch out

solutely crucial to the joke, and I

out there selling their routines on-

How do you feel about pirating and
how it affects your shows and sales?

BR: There’s a beneﬁt to people
out there trying to become fans,
whether they’re buying it or not
buying it, but I don’t completely
condone pirating. What bugs me
is when I look in the audience and
I see a little red light on and they’re
videotaping a bit in its infancy and
then they can post that, and I don’t
want thatversion out there. I don’t
want someone to see a bit and be

it’s not done!

TPN: In regards to your newest
work, All By Myself (exclusively on
a CD available on your website), do
you worry about people pirating

' and releasing that?

BR: One reason I got into com-
edy is because I love it, and I try
not to let it get to the point where I
replace the love with fear or worry.
People are going to do what they’re
going to do. I like the philosophy in
comedy and in life; you can control
what you can control and the rest
you let go..It isn’t something that I
lose any sleep over.

TPN: For a comedian like your-
self, everyday experiences are your
research.

BR: They say a formula for com-
edy is “comedy equals tragedy plus

, time” — tragedy meaning anything
3 awkward or uncomfortable. It’s like

you’re changing a tire in the rain. At
the time, you’re furious and you’re
cursing at the wind and then after
some time passes you’re telling the
story and everyone’s laughing.

TPN: It’s ﬁinny that you say
“cursing at the wind” because most
of your stand-up is completely
clean.

BR:_I like doing clean comedy.
It’s ﬁin for me. I like dirty com—
edy —— I love Dave Chappelle, I love
Chris Rock. Richard Pryor may be
the greatest stand-up comedian
who ever lived, and he certainly
worked blue. So, different strokes

for different folks, that’s all. [5

A5 mmzbgmres evolve, counay muszkmakes oz comeéack  

Emily Horstman, WPTS Contributor

For some, country music has been

placed in a danger zone, unﬁt for ‘
music listeners to enjoy. When

asked a favorite music genre, many
people will answer vaguely, “Every-
thing but country.” This imprecise
answer might help a music aﬁcio-
nado avoid rambling through a list
of genres, but it still implies an aver-
sion to CMT.

But where exactly does country
music stop and every other genre
begin? Is country music so isolated
and irrelevant to other types of mu-
sic? Today, not many self—respecting
artists list Taylor Swift or Carrie Un-
derwood as musical inﬂuences, but

But where
exacuy does
country music

stop and
every other

genre begin?

country music has a much more vast
history than present—day listeners
might think.

Bob Dylan, a hugely inspira-
tional ﬁgure, is a giant in the music
industry, and not only in country
rock. He changed the face of popu-
lar music (and the voice — it’s just
a little bit raspier now), inﬂuenc-
ing artists across genres from Tom
Waits to Conner Oberst (frontmen
bf Desaparecidos and Bright Eyes)
and from Wyclefjean to Nirvana.

Dabbling in folk, gospel, rocka-
billy and classic rock, Dylan’s 1969
Nashville Skyline was an entirely
country record, featuring a duet
with johnny Cash as the opening
track.

; Dylan’s crossover spearheaded
a decade of heavily country—inﬂu-
enced musicians such as Gram Par-
sons, Neil Young, the Grateful Dead
and even the Rolling Stones. Tracks
such as the Rolling Stones’ “Honky
Tonk Women” and the Grateful
Dead’s cover of the country hit “El

Paso” both emulate a Dylan—esque
sound.

Though these songs might seem
to be more ﬁt for a rock genre than
a country genre, there is hardly a
difference in historical context. In
past decades, the two sounds were
more similar than they are today.

Before World War II, country
music was generally referred to
as “hillbilly” music until Billboard

switched the term to “folk/blues” -

and then to “country” in 1949. In
the early 1950s, the term hillbilly
resurged in rockabilly, one of the
earliest forms of rock‘ and roll,
which was championed  famous
artists Elvis Presley and ‘Johnny
Cash. l

The rest is history. Elvis» and his ‘
contemporaries got their music on i

the radio. Then, British music ex-
ecutives and audiences heard the

new genre. The British (ﬁguratively) '
invaded, and The Beatles exploded ' 9

onto themusic scene. This demon-
strates the web.of musical inﬂuence.

Is any of this history relevant
outside of Nashville today? Yes.
Country traditions have not been
forgotten in popular culture.

In their 2002 ﬁlm “O Brother,
Where Art Thou?,” the Coen broth-
ers paid tribute to this rich history
through the use of country music,
revitalizing old hits like “Man of
Constant Sorrow” and reintroduc-
ing popular culture back to country
and folk styles, such as bluegrass.

Ten years later, bluegrass has
begun to gain major popularity with
bands like Trampled by Turtles, a
group that has performed sold-
out shows at Mr. Smalls theater in
Pittsburgh. Another band that has
enjoyed recent success is indie folk
sisters First Aid Kit, whose single
“Emmy1ou” pays tribute to the
sweet country duets of Emmylou
Harris and Gram" Parsons.

Take a look at your own music li-
brary and you might ﬁnd that some,
of your favorite artists,— such as
Elvis Costello, Fleet Foxes and even
Bono — listened to country greats.

With this continuance of the
musical genre, it looks like coun-
try music doesn’t exist in a vacuum,
after all.

Iannazzo pitched ﬁve scor

less innings before allowing three

runs on three hits in the sixth

 

inning. He continued until one ‘

out remained in the ninth inning
before Pitt managerjde Jordano
pulled him in favor of Joe-Har-
vey, who got the last out for the
Panthers. _ , A

“It was a solid series for me,”
Iannazzo‘ said. “I threw well and
saved our bullpen for the double-
header.”

Seton Hall 4, Pitt 1

On Saturday, Pitt played a dou-
bleheader agaihst Seton Hall. In
the second game of the series,
the Panthers hoped to continue
producing the offense that led
them to Friday’s big win.

Despite pickingup 10 hits,-. 1

Pitt couldn’t replicate Friday.’s
performance, as it struggled to
string the hits together in the
same inning and dropped game
two of the three-game set.
Seton Hall scored its ﬁrst run

' off Pitt sophomore right-hander

Ethan Mildren in the fourth in-
ning. ’

Two innings later, the Pirates
had a four-hit inning that pro-
duced two runs and gave them
a 3-0 lead. Jordano then pulled
Mildren, who ﬁnished with ﬁve
strikeouts and zero walks in six
innings of work. *

Ba)/em Murzie/7, Chelsea square ojjriu UEFA C/oampious League Final

Jasper Wilson, Asszstaint Sports Editor

The favorites may not have made it to 
Saturday’s Union of European Football
Associations Champions League Final, _the
most important match in European profes— ‘
sional club soccer, but that doesn’t mean .
the match lacks appeal for the neutral fan.

The Champions League tournament,
which pits the best European soccer clubs .
against each other, is rivaled only by The -
World Cup in terms of prestige. And the
storylines leading up to this year’s decid-
ing match between Bayern Munich (Ger-
many) and Chelsea (England) make this set
to be one of the most intriguing ﬁnals ever.

Although it’s common for Americans ~
to call the Champions League Final the
“Super Bowl” of soccer, the final’s world-
wide viewership routinely dwarfs that of
the football competition. The Super Bowl
is more like theachampions League Final
of American football.

For casual fans that haven’t4folloWed
the season — or soccer in general — thus
far, here’s a rundown of the two clubs set
to compete on Saturday.

Q FROM PAGE 11

WILSN

Chelsea -

The Blues have gone through nine man-
agers since Russian oil magnate Roman
Abramovich took over as ‘club owner in
2003. ‘

‘ p This year’s new manager, André Villas-
Boas, was an assistant at the club from
2004-2007, but that familiarity didn"’t
spare him from the wrath of the Russian.
Villas—Boas was ﬁred in March with Chel-

sea struggling in the Champions League‘

and sitting at a disappointing ﬁfth place

in the English Premier League standings. '

But interim manager Roberto Di Mat-
teo has turned things around for Chelsea.
He led the club to victory in England’s
biggest club competition, the FA Cup, and
now he hopes to win his second trophy as
the Blues’ manager after just two months
in charge.‘ '

r The Blues
aren’t happy  
simply to be-
in thefina|'—'

they want to-

win it.

To make it to the Champions League
Final, Chelsea upset defending champion
Barcelona, a team widely seen as the best
ever for its sustained dominance over the
past four seasons.

But the Blues aren’t happy simply to be
in the ﬁnal —— they want to win it.

Since Abramovich’s takeover in 2003,
Chelsea has won the Premier League ‘three
times. and the FA Cup four times.‘ All of
this success, however, means little to

Chelsea’s Russian owner, who continues ‘

to send the crystal-clear message that he
will not accept anything, less than Cham-
pions League tit1es.- 4
After ﬁnishing sixth in this season’s
Premier League, a defeat would also mean
Chelsea would fail to qualify for next sea-
son’s Champions League for the first time
in a decade. Only the top four teams in the
Premier League standings qualify for,E_u,-
rope’s premier club competition each year.
It is safe‘ tojassume -that if Di Matteo
can’t- guide, the Blues to their ﬁrst Eu-
ropean crown, he too won’t return next
season. ' ’ V '

Bayern Munich

Bayern Munich is the most successful
club in Germany’s history, having won the
Bundesliga title 22 times and the Cham-
pions League four times. _

Munich returns to the ﬁnal after losing
it to Inter Milan two years ago.

Die Roten, which means “The Reds” in
German, ﬁnished second in the Bundes-
liga this season, securing Champions
League qualiﬁcation for next year.

But Bayern Munich enters the ﬁnal
on a sour note after an embarrassing 5-2
recent defeat in the German Cup Final to
Borussia Dortmund.

Like Chelsea, Bayern Munich also upset
one of Spain’s powerful clubs on the way
to the final. R

The German club beat Real Madrid,
winners of this season’s Spanish league,
in tie—breaking penalty kicks during the
dramatic semiﬁnal. V

This Saturday, the Germans will be-

"come just the fourth team — and the ﬁrst

since 1984 — to play a Champions League
Final in their home stadium, the Allianz
Arena in Munich. ' _
Historically, “home teams” are 2-1 in
Champions League Finals, with the lone
loss comingon penalty kicks, so this re-
cord bodes well for Bayern supporters.
With the club functioning as Germany’s
predominant professional team, many
players also play on the German national
team. Joachim Liiw, the manager of Team
Germany, has voiced concern over the ef-
fects that a loss in the ﬁnal might have on
the eight Bayern players who will play for
Germany in the European Championships

A beginning in June. —

If there wasn’t enough riding on the

i - match for bothichelsea and Bayern Mu-

nich, another English team —+ Totten-
ham Hotspur —— will alsobe watching the
match intently. ‘

A Chelsea triumph means the Blues A

will qualify for next season’s Champions
League — and Tottenham, a team that
ﬁnished in the fourth and ﬁnal Champi-
ons League qualifying spot of the Premier
League, will lose its place in the lucrative
tournament. l
Therefore, Tottenham’s players and

fans will be huge Bayern Munich support-
ers this Saturday, because a Chelsea win
would send Tottenham down to Europe’s‘ '

secondary club ‘competition, the Europa
League, next season. " , F T - E E’

The Europa League is soccer’s equiva-
lent to the NIT‘ in college basketballziltyhas
some good teams thatjust missed out on
the big tournament, but that doesn’t make
up for_the fact that the glory  and more

importantly, the money — is lacking. It’s a '

fate I would never wish on anyone, which

is why I’ll be rooting for the Blues to lose. - «

ning when Parente singled in junior John
Peluso, but Seton Hall quickly restored its
three-run lead by scoring off sophomore
pitcherJ.R. Leonardi in the eighth inning.

Pitt attempted a comeback in the ninth

when Vazquez, Evan Oswald and Ronald '

Sucre all recorded singles. But with the
bases loaded, Vranka grounded into a
game—ending double play that killed the
potential rally.

Seton Hall 4, Pitt 3

The ﬁnal game of the series had sopho-
more right-hander Matt Wotherspoon on
the mound as the Panthers searched for
a key win.

Seton Hall took a 1-0 lead in the ﬁrst
inning, but Pitt tied the game up in its half
of the second when Soto singled in Roche.

The Pirates quickly regained their ad-
vantage when they scored another run in
the bottom of the second, and the game
didn’t produce any more runs until the
eighth inning.

After striking out 10 batters, Jordano
pulled Wotherspoon after he walked a
batter.Jordano called on freshman closer
Tanner Wilt, who struggled to ﬁnish the

' inning. The freshman gave up two hits that

allowed the Pirates to take a commanding
4-1 lead.
Fighting for their playoff lives, the Pan-
thers tried to ﬁght back in the ninth inning.
Roche came through with a double that

    

MONDAY-FRIDAY 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM
GASH outvg

 

 

 

 

drove in sophomore Mike Douglas, who
was running for Parente. Vazquez then
scored Roche with another double to bring
the score to 4-3. . ,  .

“Both games ﬁnished with solid come-
back attempts,” Devereaux said. “We just
didn’t get the job done.” ’

With Vazquez on second base and only
one out, Pitt failed to drive in the tying run,
losing the game and the series.

“It was two tough ball games,”Jordano
said of the doubleheader. “Both Seton Hall
pitchers did a very nice job, as did ours.
I thought Mildren did a solid job for us,
and I thought Wotherspoon did a great

, job, as well.”

The Panthers ﬁnished the weekend one
game back from Villanova in ninth place
— the same standing they held going into
the Seton Hall series.

Devereaux believes the Panthers still
have a legitimate shot to qualify for the
Big East Tournament. —

“With Villanova doingfwhat they did last
weekend, it gives us a chance this weekend
to still get in the tournament,” he said.
“We can only control what we do and will
be focused on winning our series against
Louisville.” '

But being behind Villanova by one
game, Pitt doesn’t control its own destiny
when it hosts the Cardinals in the vital
season—ending series this weekend.

“It’s all coming down to this weekend,”
Roche said. “Obviously, we’ll be checking
on what Villanova is doing, but our main.
concern is winning one game at a time.”I

to commit to the school.

“I want to be a part of Pitt’s great his-
tory,” Jones said. “Jamie Dixon is a nice
man, a great coach. I also have a great re-
lationship with [assistant coach] Brandin
Knight and the rest of the coaching sta .”

Kline expressed optimism aboutjones’
potential impact at Pitt.

“Chris is an extremely versatile player
who will play-both the [shooting guard]
and [small forward] in college,” Kline said.

“He is not going to see the floor early, but ‘

will make a great four-year player who
will make a major impact in his junior and
senior seasons at Pitt.”

Jones "participated on the red senior
team in the Mary Kline Classic — an event
that included an underclassmen game and
a senior game, along with skills, 3-point
and dunk competitions.

“The Kline Classic was a great talent

showcase, with some of the best high‘

school players in the country,” said Ali
Aneizi, a Pitt sophomore who attended
the event. “The fact that Chris Jones was
invited and played well shows that he can
compete at Pitt’s level.”

Also representing Pitt at the event was
Anderson, an 18-year-old nativejamaican
who is considered to be the tallest teenage
girl in the world.

She made her appearance as a featured

 

§   i  9th Stet  owmown Pittsburgh
0 www.musnexoiic.com  612-281-7703

judge in the dunk competition and generi“
ously gave most dunks a perfect 10 score.

Anderson, who averaged 23 points, 6.2
rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game at Rut-
gers Prep and has appeared on “The Oprah
Winfrey Show,” ‘will hope to help rebuild
a Pitt women’s basketball program that«.
went winless in Big East play last season.

Along with Pitt’s 6—foot—11 men’s bas-
ketball center Malcolm Gilbert, who was
watching his brother Marcus at the event,
Anderson towered over much of the sell-
out crowd. Z

“Bubbles could be the tallest defender?
Malcolm Gilbert has to practice against at
Pitt,” Aneizi said, joking about the height
of the pair of players.

This was the second consecutive year
that two future Panthers participated in
the Classic.

In 2011, Pitt recruits Khem Birch and
John Johnson put up double—digit points
in the event’s ﬁrst year.

The second annual Mary Kline Classic
raised a total of more than $20,000 for
cancer research — an amount that nearly,‘
tripled last year’s total. l

Kline said that he plans on moving the
event to a bigger venue next year in the
hope of attracting more donations for
cancer research, as well as even better
basketball talent. .

“Next year’s event will feature an even

1 more stacked lineup in the senior and un-

derclassmen games,” Kline said, “includ—
ing whatwe hope to be the No. 1 and_No.

2 rising juniors in the country.” .
