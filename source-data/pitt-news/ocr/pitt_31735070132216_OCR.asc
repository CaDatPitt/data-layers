One of America 3 greatest student newspapers -—i since 1906

An ‘80shair band rocks i the Union

Staff Writer
They wore pleather pants and
cut—off T-shirts, they. threw up their
hands and rocked on, and, yes,_they

‘even had permed mullets.

It was Athe ’80s all over again at
Pitt. . .

Son of Glam, an ’80s hair—rock
tribute band, entertained a crowd of
about 150 students Tuesday night in
the William Pitt Union, playing
covers from bands such as Def
Leppard and Bon Jovi.

' The band’ included lead vocalist
Lincoln Teazer, bassist Mychael St.
Sainte, lead guitarist Mick Likks,
keyboardist Gunner Downe an
drummer Stixx N. Stones.  
A Isabel Musial, the special
events director for the Pitt Program
Council explained that she had seen

A Son of Glam at a programming con-

ference and then wanted to brin

‘ them to Pitt. ‘ .

“I had been thinking of doing
something ’80s—related since I was
elected,” Musial said.

PPC members decorated female ‘

students’ faces before the concert
with ‘80s—style make—up; brightly
coloredeyeshadows, rainbow and
star stickers, and pink and yellow
nail polish. A _

I The show began A with lead
singer Teazer, wearingred, pleather
pants, a.pirate—like shirt and a hand-

cuff. belt, shouting, “Pittsburgh,
how ya doingftonight?” S

The band ‘immediately broke
into its first ’80s cover, entertaining
the students with choreographed

dancing. The audience was stagnant

at first, but by the time Son‘ of Glam
played Bon J_ovi’s “Livin’ on a
Prayer,” they were dancing wildly.
Son of -Glam slowed it down
and played “Every Rose has Its

“Thorn” by Poison, and students

swayed and held. up their illuminat-
ed cell phones in place of lighters.
Other covers included “Rock
you like a Hurricane,” by the
Scorpions, “Pour Some Sugar On
Me,” by Def Leppard, “You Give
Love a Bad Name,” by Bon Jovi
and “._Jessie’s Girl,” ‘ by Rick

Pitt professors addresses race relations in law

LAURA JERPI
Staff Writer‘

Who would have thought that a
middle—class, suburban school such
as Columbine High School could
actually be at a higher risk for
extreme violence than other, more
diverse places, such as Berkeley
High School?

Richard Delgado.

According to him, this is exact— '
— ly the case, and it is because diver-

sity creates-more places for students
to fit in. I .

The Inaugural Derrick A.‘ Bell
Lecture — held on Tuesday evening
in the Pitt School of Law’s Teplitz
Moot Court Room -—- featured
Delgado, a Pitt law professor and a
Derrick A. Bell fellow, and his
wife, Jean Stefancic, a Derrick A.
Bell scholar and Pitt law professor.
Their lecture was titled “Cultural
DNA.” ‘

Delgado and Stef-ancic, who
also share_ the position of co-editor
for the New York University Press
series “Critical America,” have

after taking a two—year, unpaid

Stefancic described Bell as an
“inspirational leader in the struggle

During the lecture, Stefancic
gave a few examples of social injus-

According to her, year after

RACHAEL COUP/CONTRIB UTING EDITOR

Dr. Thomas Starzl, University of Pittsburgh Press’ longest best-selling author,
signed copies of his book at the Unversity Book Centerlast Thursday.

Starzl: accomplished surgeon
and a best-selling author, too

E-RIC SAPQRITO
_Staff Writer

The longest best-selling author
from the University of Pittsburgh
Press isn’t even a writer. He’s a
world-renowned transplant surgeon
pioneer. ,

Situated, between two stacks of
his books, Dr. Thomas Starzl used
his country charm to endear himself.
to h-is autograph seekers at a book-
signing in the University Book
Center last Thursday.

Posing’ with fans -for pho-
tographs and chatting with them
about their lives, ‘Starzl offered
advice to those who came to thank
him for his pioneering transplant
work and to tell him their own
organ transplant stories.

Now in its re-release as a paper-
back, “The Puzzle People: Memoirs
of ‘Transplant Surgeon,”— recounts
Starzl’s life and career, from his

childhood memories to his world-'

wide recognition as a transplant
surgeon. ‘

The book has an added epilogue '

and post-script that brings the book
up-to datewith _today’s medical pro-
cedures.

The addendums also describe
the longevity milestones some of
this first patients achieved, living 40

v engaged physicians,

years as some of the first kidney-
transplant recipients. ‘

0 ‘“Puzzle People” has sold close
to 60,000 copies around theworld
and was translated ‘into seven dif-
fcrent languages. Starzl’s book has

“You’cou1d say that this book,‘

has long—standing legs, considering
how it’s been on the market and [is]
still selling well,’’ Starzl said. 3
At one time, Starzl wrote an
average of‘7.3 papers a week. He
has received more than "175 honors
and awards, and he was placed at

213 in the book, “1,000 Years,-

1,000 People: Ranking the Men and

School in Chicago and, in 1952, he
earned a Ph.D. in neurophysiology
and an M.D. with distinction. He
joined the faculty of the University
of Colorado School of Medicine in
1962 and spent his last eight years
there as chairman of the department
of surgery. . . 1

Starzl left the University of
Colorado for Presbyterian
University Hospital, now part of
UPMC, where he served as chief of
transplant surgery services until
1991.

Starzl pioneered a commoni

organ transplant treatment used
today to prevent a host’s body from
rejecting the newly planted foreign
tissue. '

‘ He combined Imuran and corti-

costeroids to suppress the body’s
immune system. A

Starzl later worked on another
breakthrough drug, this one a com-
bination of anti-lymphocyte globu;
lin and cyclosporine. This treat-
ment enabled patients in the end
stage of organ failure to receive an
organ transplant.

--In 1989, Starzl and his team
from UPMC discovered a new anti-
rejection drug, FKSO6, which is
also known as tacrolimus, or”
Prograf. T A

The Thomas  Starzl
Transplantation Institute ‘is housed
in UPMC Montefiore.

On average, an organ is trans-
planted every 18 hours at any one
of the three hospitals affiliated with
the institute.

Since 1981, nearly 12,000
transplants have been performed at

experience unmatched by any other

“It was so fun; it was a good
change, because we don’t usually

get bands,” said freshman Shannon

Payne’.

At the conclusion of the show,
the band announced that lead singer
Teazer had performed the whole
night with laryngitis.

Students were able to talk to
band members, get autographs and
take pictures after the show. Bassist
St. Saint advised students, “Jack
Daniel’s and beer is not a cure for
laryngitis,” poking fun at Teazer.

“We had a good time; I think people
really enjoyed it,” St. Sainte added.
Sophomores Liz Horzempa and
Julie Sbuscio said they attended the
concert “to rock ‘n’ roll,’’ and added
that the concert was awesome.
Jocelyn Brown, program coor-

dinator for PPC, said the event gave ’

students an appreciation for differ-
ent decades. '

“What’s not to love about the
’80s asked freshman Leigha Smith
as she waited to meet the band.

“I think the event went really
well,’’ Musial said. “I’m glad that

Should politics and football everniix?

CBS is refusing to run a Super
Bowl ad—spot that it considers to be
political advocacy.

The ad, a 30—second spot called
“Child’s Pay,” criticizes President
George W. Bush’s running up of the
federal deficit. It was the winner of
a contest sponsored ,by
MoveOn.org, a liberal advocacy
group. The contest, called “Bush in
30 Seconds,” invited would-be film-
makers to take a shot at the
President, and MoveOn.org would
pay the $1.5 million to $3 million
CBS charges for a 30—second spot
during the game.

CBS claims it wants to avoid
controversy. The network will, how-
ever, run an anti-drug advertisement
from the White House, paid for with
taxpayer dollars, along with count-
less advertisements that could be
construed as offensive for their
beer-shilling junk-food glorification
and overall jiggle quotient.

CBS is an independent media
entity, and can "run or not run what-
ever content it sees fit. But, by car-
rying the Super Bowl, a game
expected to draw nearly 100 million
viewers, CBS is also part of a pub-
lic forum, and thus ought to be a
willing participant in the market-
place of ideas. ‘

MoveOn.org is attempting to
protest CBS’s decision by organiz-

ing a boycott of the Super Bowl.
Even they acknowledge the near-
futility of asking red—blooded
Americans to do this. A great num-
ber of Americans love football,
even to the exclusion of their ideal-
ism. ‘
The network wants to avoid
angering the nearly captive audi-
ence that the Super Bowl usually
draws, but the point is all but moot.
It is highly unlikely that a Super
Bowl viewer, seeing an offensive
advertisement, will throw down the
remote in rage and turnoff the big
game without seeing the outcome.
That’s just not how football is con-
sumed. Most viewers -that tune in
will tune in for the entire game.

To say that Super Bowl viewers
will be enraged by having political

~commentary interspersed with their

clever talking frogs, is to do them a
great disservice and to assume a
bovine complacency on their part.

A common complaint about the
American public is that they are
apathetic and uninformed, especial-
ly in the realm of politics. Perhaps
CBS.should take the stance that,- in
an election year, the greater interest
in having an informed citizenry
should trump concerns over viewers
who aren’t going to tune out any-
way, and have the courage to ‘ruffle
a few feathers.

What went on in'Mumbai (pre-
viously Bombay), India, last week
should act as a good start.

But I’ll get to that later.

In Seattle in—1999, the ideas of _

activism, civil disobedienceand
resistance to the powers that be res-
urrected themselves from the pages
of history and announced that in our
world, there are injustices being
perpetrated on a global
scale and that the powers
responsible should be
stopped.

A movement gained
steam, and a few years
later, anti-w_ar movement
would pull much of its
strength "and vitality from "
the momentum. initiated
in these days of protest
against globalization.

 

Will Minton era of

.Selattle’s momentum moves to Mumbai

tion, unlikevprevious such strug-
gles, is forming concurrently with
globalization itself. It is not a strug-
gle against an entrenched foe.

I’m getting to Mumbai.

Just bear with me a while
longer.

When the struggle against
apartheid began to pick up steam,

apartheid had already been the

norm.

I It was from the past,

‘, an anachronism in a
modernizing country
like South Africa.
When Gandhi and
the Indian people
forced the British out
of India, it was the
end part of a grander

colonial

decline.

But Seattle was
almost_ five" years ago,
and the movement remains stag-
nant

No other protest, at least none
in the United States, has seen the
numbers or success achieved in
Seattle.

Why?

The easy answer is that the
Seattle protests were a success
because they were a surprise. Since
then, cities scheduled to host such
large-scale events have been pre-
pared, and the increased regulations
have discouraged protesters.-

But the problem ‘runs deeper,

than that.
Modern activists like to com-

pare their struggles to those against “

the Vietnam War or the struggle
against apartheid in South Africa.
But the modern struggle is distinct-
ly different from any before it.

The struggle against globaliza-

As for Vietnam, it
suffices to say that
the war wasn’t waged in an effort to
adapt to a changing world. '

Globalization, on ‘the other
hand, is a phenomenon that will
leave its impact on the world no
matter what. -

\_The International Monetary
Fund and the World Trade
Organization are relatively new
institutions. ‘

In battling against them and the

globalization they represent, “it is '9

not enough to simply oppose them. -

India and South Africa could
look» to the other nations of the
world for models from which they
-could build their alternatives.

Ideas like “parliamentary sys-
tem” were already well understood.

The alternative to being in
Vietnam was not being in Vietnam,

back into my shell, comfortable in the
knowledge that I had three people who
understood and accepted me with mini-
mal effort waiting for me back at
Lothrop. It grew apparent that this safety
net had become a bed of nails for me.

I was supposed to be immersed in,

the college experience —— I had always
pictured this_ involving passionate,

espresso-fueled debates about .“what it K
all means” with exotic new friends who

would see in me all the potential to be the
person I yearned to become. Instead, I
was residing in a prison of my own cre-
ation, dutifully scribbling notes Enough
class before grabbing a pizza and Fritos
at the Union to bring back to the room
where my friends and Homestar Runner
awaited me — a far better alternative to

‘the agony of eating alone in public. ,\

It was pointless to try to eat with

' someone I» didn’t know. What would I

say to them after the weather and my
major were politely assessed? I wasn’t
conceived in Africa while my parents
were in the Peace Corps. I’m not a
National Merit Scholar or a prize—win—
ning violinist. I’m a skinny kid with acne
and uninformed opinions regarding Iraq
from a tract town an hour and a- half
away. ‘

I dabbledin some clubs in an effort
to break the ice, but would always clam
up whenever my thoughts on something
were asked, no matter how much I was

screaming on the inside. I determined .

that my problem was_that I was spending
too much time in my dorm room closed
off from the world.

. This led to my spending many a
weekend night pretending to be intently
absorbed in Ralph Nader pamphlets
while sitting_on the couches in Towers
Lobby and wishing I was heading out for
gparty with one‘ of the groups of friends
amalgamating before me. If jealousy is
all the fun you think they’re having, then
I would be green with envy — except
that would distinguish me too much and

rob me of my Pink Floyd destiny, of

being just another brick in the wall.

Protesters need a clearer grip on what they stand for

Minton, page 8

and that was sufficient.

Now, for the first time, a com-
pletely original alternative is neces-
sary.

We have no workable world
trade—regulating body in our history
to appeal to.

To simply say

Protesters are united as to what
they are against, but when asked

“NO

‘ what they are for, respond either in

confusion, or at best, with general
slogans like “Fair trade, not free

I

trade,” which actually have little
relevance in terms of suggesting
feasible changes to policy.

As a result, moderates are left
with the impression that the move-
ment is simply a bunch of idealistic
youths with no clear grip on the
issues at hand.

They’re more likely to view
thosearrested in marches as out—of—
line rioters, than as martyrs for a
cause. They may be right.

Simple anti-globalization
efforts may have been a good step
in 1999, but it has become painfully
clear that that is not enough.

We need fuel for an alternate

globalization plan.

Which brings me to Mumbai
and the 75,000 people who met
there last week. ‘

It was the fourth meeting of the
World Social Forum, a group of
people who get together once a year
to try and do what I just advocated
— effect realchange. A group of
people who, in the past four years,
have done very little.

This year, they welcome two
Nobel laureates: Joseph Stiglitz,
2001’s Nobel Prize-winning econo-
mist and author of “Globalization
and its Discontents,” and Shirin
Ebadi, this year’s winner of the

mother calls her to ask if she’ll be

making it home for Christmas. Kron

uses all of her patience to remind

Her girlfriend, Peggy, provides
the contrast to Kron’s family with

Afterattending one of Peg’s family

But most important to the story '

is her father: a man who lost his

in many ways, the show is as much

Saltunleashes newissue with beer, Donkey Kong

The newest issue of a quirky Pittsburgh mag-
azine is hitting the streets this Saturday, and its
creators want you to be there to witness it —— and
maybe get a little drunk and play “Donkey Kong,”
too. "

According to the mission statement written by
its creators, Salt “is a journal that modemizes and
reinterprets archetypes. Each issue explores a
theme aesthetically, literally, and metaphorical-
ly.”

The latest issue deals with the theme of
robots. And if you think there’s not a lot of cre-
ativity that can stem from something as mundane

and utterly sterile as robots, you are sorely mis-

taken. Salt, The Robot Issue, will contain features

on robot fetishists, Disney’s automatons, original
art, a comic by Daniel Clowes (the creator of
“Ghost World”) and much more.

And, really, who wouldn’t want to support a
magazine whose launch party is billed as “Beer,
Bands and Donkey Kong?” .

The acts ‘slated to perform are Girl Talk, an
exciting group hailing from Cleveland; Hooligan
Ship, a band whose mission is, to make you dance;
and Cory Tveten, a rising rock ‘n’ roll artist.

And if you’re nostalgic for the days when
Donkey Kong reigned supreme, head to Games N
At Video Arcade on the South Side with your
pockets full of clanging change as plenty of the
classic arcade game will be played at Salt’s

release party.

A common complaint among the young peo-
ple in Pittsburgh is that only old people live here
and there’s no way to get involved in anything
exciting. Here’s your chance to enter the vibrant
independent community populated by young peo-
ple who want to improve the city’s image and
make it a better place for our generation to live.

Salt, The Robot Issue will be released this
Saturday, at 9 p.m'. at Games N At Video Arcade,-
2010 Josephine St. Coiier charge is $5. For more
information, call (4.12) 481-2002. ’

The Big Bounce

Starring Owen Wilson, Morgan
Freeman, Gary Sinise, Charlie
Sheen, Sara Foster

Directed by George Armitage

ikikl/2

“The Big Bounce,” from director

‘George Armitage (“Grosse Pointe

Blank”), is a chaotic but fun crime caper
in which everyone’s a criminal, no one’s
a bad guy and “things are exactly as they
appearf’ Based on the novel of the same
title from Ehnore Leonard, this movie
follows the slightly immoral but entire-
ly charming Jack Ryan (Owen Wilson)
— not to be confused with the govern-
ment agent of the same name in Tom
Clancy books. ,

Jack loses his job when he hits his
boss with a pipe in order to stall con-

struction on sacred land by local- develé .
oper Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise). Charges

are dropped in order to ward off bad
publicity, and Jack is ordered to leave

T Hawaii. He declines to do so, taking a

job managing vacation bungalows for
Judge Walter ‘Crewes (Morgan
Freeman) instead. ‘ A

While working at Crewes’ bunga-
lows, Jack meets Nancy (Sara Foster),

girlfriend to his former boss, Ritchie. .

She’s a gorgeous girl with a weakness
for criminal types. The t 0 pair up and
devise a plan to steal $ 00,000 - from
Ritchie. As the movie progresses,’ how-
ever, it becomes clear that not everyone
is playing by therules. The question is:
Who is scamming who?

The answer to that question is never
made entirely clear. Even after the plot
unfolds and the heist takes place, there
are loose ends that are never tied up.

Some characters’_ motivations are clear, -

while others’ are a bit uncertain. The

confusion, however, does not detract

from the fun. A V .

for the most part, eccentric but lovable,

Armitage’s direction is what leads

offbeat character, delivering witty

Foster portrays Nancy with sass and
style. Also shining is Bebe Neuwirth

(“Le Divorce”) in her comical portrayal
of Ritchie’s wife. The rest of the cast
gives fair performances, though many
of the actors, especially Gary Sinise, are
cast in roles too small, given their capa-
bilities. V

they give the film a nice break from
the monotony of the dialogue and

Off the wire: Couple shocks in new MTV reality show

J AYAE SoNi
Michigan Daily (U. Michigan)

(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. -
What happens when bad—boy rock star
Dave Navarro falls in love with former
“Baywatch” lifeguard Carmen Electra?
They make a reality TV show on MTV
that adds to the lineup of superstar
sagas, such as “Newlyweds.” But
unlike Jessica Simpson, Carmen Electra
has common sense, and therefore her
show is just not as funny.

What Navarro and Electrado have
over, other teenie-bopper icons is their
gothic sense of immortality and erotica.
“Til Death Do Us Part” is the perfect

theme for the couple that plans on
spending eternity together. Determined
to share their sense of commitment, the
first episode follows the couple to a
morgue for a nude photo shoot for their
wedding invitations. The series contin-
ues throughout their entire pre—wedding
process. They have a joint bache-

lorette/bachelor party with only female

strippers (because Electra believes male
strippers are disgusting) "and the wed-
ding invite list will be filled with
Hollywood stars.

Viewers may be surprised to see
that Navarro has toned down his habits
and Electra seems down—to-earth.

During the show, Navarro prides him-

self on kicking all of his addictions
(except cigarette smoking). Future
shows hint at the risque behaviorthat
many expect of the couple.

“Til Death Do Us Part” is more
shocking than humorous. The reality
series will answer all those questions
pop culture fans have about the true
lives of mysterious rock stars and wild
cover girls. And though the couple
seeems to have little in common, the
show suggests that they are a match
made in heaven. Though Electra is not
as morbid as her fiance, the two person-
alities seem complimentary and make a
realistic duo — at least by MTV’s stan-
dards.

With Boston College and St.

weeks, it looked like Panther fans
would be able to snooze their way
through that time period.
Unfortunately, it was the Pitt'men’s
basketball team that was sleepwalk-
ing against Boston College on
Wednesday night.

Down‘ 21-13 with 6:23 left to
play in the first half, the Panthers
reinserted starting point guard Carl
Krauser into the .lineup. Krauser had
been out since the 17:19 mark of the
first half when he picked up his sec-
ond personal foul.

Krauser sparked a run that
helped Pitt get back into the game.

The 8-0 Pitt run seemed to give the
Panthers all the momentum, and
then it happened. While trying to
make a big steal, Krauser picked up
his third foul and would have to sit.

While Krauser was "out, fresh-
man guard Antonio Graves stepped
in and ran the offense.

“I just Wanted to be ready, and
come up big for the team,” said
Graves.’

With Graves at the helm, the
Panthers finished the half on a 16-4

Which is better? Philly or the Burgh?

 

Last fall, most Mondays follow-

ing football Sundays found this

campus looking like a sea of green.
The Philadelphia Eagles enjoyed
their third straight successful season
that ended" with the Nation-al
Football Conference championship
game, one step short of the Super
Bowl. Die-hard black—and—gold fans
suffered through a dismal season for
their beloved Steelers. Eagles

chants and McNabb jerseys found"

their way into each-one of my class-
es and constantly forced me to leave

class early before I ran my big

mouth, knowing that, in a fight, I
couldn’t really back it up. -

So now that I _have gotten
through the fluff of that opening
paragraph, let’s get to the point of
this column. The idea behind this
masterpiece is a question, a question
that I pose to you sports fans from
each end of the Turnpike: Is it better
to be a ‘Philadelphia fan or a

a disease,‘ much like cancer or dia-

lions of Americans and, regardless

Pittsburgh fan?

For Philly fans, heartbreak is
something that, lately, they have had
to experience too many times. The
most beloved team from the City of
Brotherly Love, the Eagles, have
caused their fans more pain recently
than any other sports team since the
Buffalo Bills of the early ’90s that
lost four straight Super Bowls.

Three straight NFC champi-
onships, two of them at home, and
the Eagles were outplayed in all
three. Philly is suffering from the
longest droughtwithout a champi-
onship amongst cities that have four
major sportsteams. The Eagles have
never won a Super_Bowl, the Flyers
haven’t raised the cup since ’75, and
the Phillies won their last World
Series in ’80. It has been 21 years
and counting since the Sixers, led
by Dr. J, brought a title back to
Philadelphia. ‘

That means that not one under-
graduate on this campus can remem-
ber the l_ast time the city of
Philadelphia called itself World
Champion. '

In 2001, the Sixers gave fans
hope as they made the NBA finals,
only to fall short. The Flyers, con-
sistently one of the best -teams in
hockey, went to the finals in 1997,
but were dominated by", the Detroit

are an alcoholic, and it is a decision

that has taken him nearly 40 years .

to make.

The real tragedy ‘would have
been if Namath had decided‘ to
sweep the incident under the carpet
and continue on as ifhe did not
have a problem. That would -have
been taking the easy way out. There
was nothing funny or acceptable
about Namath’s behavior while
intoxicated on the Jets’ sideline, but
his decision to seek help for his

addiction "is one that should be’

respected. '

-What is the point of _recruits_ giving
verbal commitments to universi-
ties? I v V ~’

An answer often heard is that
players give verbal commitments in
order to get recruiters off of their

backs. The reality of the situation is.

that this frequently brings onmore
attention. ' _

Penn Hills quarterback Anthony
Morelli and North ‘Hills running
back Andrew Johnson are cases in
point. '

Red Wings invfour straight losses.

This year, the Flyers lead their
division, but it is unclear-whether
they have the reliable goalie needed
for a full playoff run. For the past
few years, three out of four hasn’t
been bad for Philadelphia fans, but
from now on, four out of four could
be the expectation.

After having had their best sea-
son in, years in 2003, the Phillies
have made more off—season moves
this year to make themselves the
front runner in the National League
East. - 

So to sum it up, Philly fans have
four quality teams that, each year,
will be arrfong the best in their sport,
and come playoff time, will have
them thinking this could be the year.
A great possibility of triumph but an
even greater possibility of pain.

For fans from the Steel City,‘

going to the conference champi-
onship game and losing isn’t a new
thing. Steelers’ fans are even one
step ahead of Eagles fans, thanks to
the Steelers’ loss in Super Bowl

T ‘ t etc 0
Both players gave Pi-tti verbal
commitments last summer, yet
recently have stated that they will
look at offers from other schools. ’
Johnson committed to ‘Pitt all
the way back in July, but went on an

official visit to Ohio State. He also
met with University of Miami head

coach Larry Coker when he was in_
town a few weeks ago, and he plans

to visit Florida and Miami.

The star quarterback recently had a

"weekend on an official visit to Penn

The bottom line is that, no mat- -

ter what you hear, "nothing is final

Panthers’ winning streak at

College, the freshman then‘ hit a
layup as the half ended to tie the
score at halftime.

“Antonio had a great. game,”

Dixon said. _“He made a big shot’ at '

the end of the half. He"s fortunate
to be playing with some smart play-

ers.
“I just have to be ready and

’ come up big,” said Graves about
-what he was thinking before enter-

ing the game. “I play hard and do
what I know I can do.”

Graves started the second half
in place of Krauser and helped Pitt
continue its run. The_ Panthers
scored the first 12 points of the half
and looked well on their way to
becoming the first team in the coun-
try with 20 wins.

But with 12:42 remaining in the
game, the Eagles started to chip

away at the lead.

Led by eight points from Agbai,
Boston College put together an 11-
4 run and cut Pitt’s lead down to
three following two free throws
from Nate Doornekamp.

Two more free throws by Jared
Dudley brought the Eagles within
one, and, after a tip—in by Jermaine
Watson, Boston College held a one-
point lead with 3:54 to go.

“We gave them a cushion,”
,Skinner said about the beginning of
the second half. “That was the ball
game. We got close and had the
opportunity.” , A

But like they have so many
times this season, the Panthers were
able to pull out the victory.

“These guys are winners,”
Dixon said of his team. “They
believe in each other, and that’s
why you don’t see one guy trying to
do it all.”

Krauser shows why he is the team leader

foul trouble, Panthers head coach
Jamie Dixon kept Graves in, and his
gamble appears to have paid off.

Graves and the Panthers opened the '

half on a 12-0 run, and were in con-

trol for the majority of the half.

“That run gave them their cush-
ion. That was’, the ball game. We
played’ catch-up after that. Those
four minutes cost us the ball game,”
Boston College head coach Al
Skinner said. -

Until that run, Graveswas most
known for his last-second miss in
the Panthers loss at Connecticut. But
that would change after tonight.

Graves was able to control the

tempo and run the Panthers offense,

which was sluggish to start the
game. He finished the game with
four points, five assists, one
rebound, one steal, and 21 important
minutes for his team.

“Antonio had a great game. He is

a kid who keeps getting better and
better,” Dixon said.

Boston College, however, did
make a run, but the Panthers’ back-
court took control and took over the
game. Guard Julius Page, who had
been struggling with his outside
shooting, hit two big three-pointers.

Page’s three-pointers, along with
the return of Krauser, ended up clos-
ing the door on the Eagles. While
Graves was able to get the clone job
in Krauser’s absence, it was Krauser
who made the final plays. After the
Eagles took a 55-54 lead with three
minutes to play, Krauser showed
why he was the leader of the team.

-Krauser did so by making the next

two Panther hoops to put Pitt up for
good, and added four free throws to
keep the game out of reach.

“My role is to make sure we
win,” Krauser said. “Antonio Graves
came in and stepped up real big. He
gave us great defense, great energy.
He did what we expected him to do”

-Penguins are in financial despair

and are facing the possibility of
folding. -

If the Pens are forced to move, it
would leave Pittsburgh with just
two major sports teams and would
easily make Philadelphia the most
powerful sports town in the
Keystone State.

If the average Pitt student was
born in 1983 and is a Philly fan, he
or she has barely experienced one
world championship. They have
also witnessed at least one champi-
onship series loss from the Sixers,

Flyers and Phillies. To top it off,
they have watched the Eagles lose
three straight NFC championships.
If the average Pitt student is a
Pittsburgh fan, they have enjoyed
two Stanley Cups, one Super Bowl,
five AFC Championships and three
National League Championship
Series.

So what is the verdict? To me,

it’s easy._ If I had to choose a city to_

root for my, whole life, I would
choose Pittsburgh, but if I had to
choose a city to root for currently, I
would have to choose, well,
Pittsburgh.

Why? Because Pittsburgh fans
know the feeling of winning a
championship, and following the
pattern that Philly teams have
exhibited, Pittsburgh fans will enjoy
that feeling again before Philly fans
enjoy it for the first time.

Matt Sortino is a staffwriterfor. The
Pitt News and understands he will
be branded as just another writer
who is jealous of Philadelphia and
he;doesn’t mind that. You can tell
him how jealous he is by e-mailing
him at mbs3@pitt.edu, while he
remembers being alive for the
Penguins’ two Stanley Cups.

the national level.

Following Pitt’s narrow-‘margin
defeat at Connecticut, ESPN ana-
lyst Digger Phelps said that he was‘
surprised by the game’s outcome
and was expecting a blowout.

To be predicting a blowout
seems pretty extreme considering
that Pitt’s 75 wins over the past
three seasons_ are more than any
other Division-I school over the
three-year span. ‘ _

Pitt has been criticized for hav-
ing a weak non-conference sched-
ule that included teams like Albany
and Chicago State, but don’t forget
about the games against Alabama,
Georgia and Florida State. Pitt took
care of business and, after dominat-

ing at Syracuse last weekend, the
Panthers are ranked No. 6 in the
coaches’ poll and are getting the
respect they deserve.

-Jaromir J agr has another new home
and, in his first game in New York
as a Ranger, had a three-point night.
Could Jagr be the missing piece
of the puzzle and bring Lord
Stanley’s cup back to the cash-
happy capital of the NHL?
Probably not, but with the
Penguins holding the title of worst
team in the ‘NHL, hockey fans in
Pittsburgh have little room to criti-

g cize any team.
