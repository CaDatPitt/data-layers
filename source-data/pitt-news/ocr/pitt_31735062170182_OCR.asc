Campus Conservatism

Yet another political, action
group has been formed at the Uni-
versity. The Young Americans
for Freedom (YAF), largest con-
servative youth group in the coun-
try, will have a chapter here for
the first time.

’According to the chairman,

‘Frank Donatelli, junior political

science major, the purposes of
YAF will be: (1) To implement
principles of conservatism as
contained in the Sharon Statement,
(2) To offer a meaningful alter-
native to liberalism at the Uni-
versity, and (3) To educate the
University community about the
principles of conservatism. .

perhighways and military-indus-
trial complexes." perceives
CharlesACrowell, poet and student.

Charles Crowell mused about
his philosophy of life and how it
affects his poetry, emphasizing
awareness.

“If man was really aware of
his place in the life cycle, he would
have no need for the military and
war. If he recognized that we are
all part of the same body, war-
fare would be like severing off a
limb of his ownbody,” he believes.

Crowell’s poetry was influenced
heavily’ by classical mythology
and the Greek approach to reli-
gion. Primal man understood the
order of things whereas modern
man has forgotten it through all
his technology, evaluated the poet.

This blindness of modern man
to his own status in the “order of
things” and his own plight is a
phenomenon that must be over-
come before man can reach a lev-

el of satisfaction and harmony. ,

“Knowledge of the order of things
is equivalent to where the body
becomes void of strife and be-
comes spirit,” said Crowell,

The role of the poet lies in mak-
ingman aware of this natural or-
der of things, “this awareness
that life is death and death is life
in a never ending cycle of re-
birth.”

“Poetry is an educational pro-

cess,” offered Charlie. “I per-

ceive the poet as a priest, although .

this is a difficult position to lay
claim to. The poet has deeper in-
sights into nature. Itis his duty to
relate to man his sense of know-
ledge and order. The poet at-
tempts to relate through allusion.”

One allusion he uses often is the
Earth Goddess._The Earth God-
dess is the embodiment of the
knowledge "of the natural forces
and pattern of movement. “Man

/ keeps pursuing this Goddess, be-

cause she seems to contain the
knowledge that he seeks. What I
write about isthis very pursuit,”

- he continued.

Charles Crowell, the poet, is
reading five of his verses at the
Three Rivers Arts Festival this
Saturday night, one of which is in-
cludedwith this ineterview. He is
also plananing to publish a book of
his poetry entitled My Body With-
in You within the coming year.

“I don’t attempt to assert my
views but rather to relate -them
to see their relevance. There is
the beginning of a movement in
modern man to find relevance in
the natural state of things. Man
has_ lost the meaning of life.

nomics and the chairman of the
Curricular Review Commttee;
Jack Critchfield, vice-chancellor
for Student Affairs; and a repre-
sentative from the Black Action
Society (BAS ). '

In her monologue, Dr. Sargent
emphasized the need for educa-
tion to provide “a comprehensive
view of life and the ability to cope
with reality.” Fostering intellec-
tual honesty rather than merely
communicating knowledge must
become the goal of a university,
she continued.

Dr. Bramhall pushed for a dis-
solution of the traditional univer-
sity roles, rejecting the patient-
doctor analogy that he believes
sets the dominant tone for facul-
ty-student relations.

“The only way to train respon-
sibility is to give it to people,” he
insisted.

Some of his ideas for curricu-
lar reform include machine in-
struction in mathematics and lan-
guages, the exposure of under-
graduates to graduate courses
and the revision of the lecture
system, which he averred is a
holdover from the Middle Ages.

A different rhetoric was utilized
by Jack Critchfield in his descrip-
tion of education. “Education is a
combination of culture'and expert

knowledge in some direction,”
said the administrator.

Critchfield went on to cite to

his audience of 25 examples of‘ '‘

successful curricular reform at
other schools, such as Antioch
and Berkeley, and to propose pos-
sible models.

One he detailed was the cluster-

college complex. This model, said '

Critchfield, increases freedom

and student participation and de- _  A

creases professionalism.

Such a college consists of learn-
ing centers in human studies, the
social and behavioral sciences,

languages and mathematics and I

the natural sciences. There are no ‘

grades in the system and no dis-
tribution requirements.
school would be classified as a»
three-year liberal arts college.

The student from the BAS,lash-

ed out against the false concern
with “relevance.” “If we’re talk-
ing interms of relevance, then you
must define relevance. Because

what is taught in the University 4

today is relevant to society—being
taught to kill and to make money.
Education gets people together
and to go out and do what they are
told to do,” he said. '

Visiting. Mellon Prof.
To Present Poetry ‘_

Octavio Paz, who is currently a
visting Mellon Professor at the
University, will present a reading
of some of his poems June 17.

His poetry reading on June 17
will be held in the Frick Fine Arts

Auditorium at 8:30 p.m. and is’

open to the University and to the
public in general. Mr. Paz will
read his poems in Spanish, and
Paul Blackburn, a young Ameri-
can poet, will read the English
translations.

    

ocnwlo PAZ.

Paz, who has been described by
Samuel Beckett as “one of the
best living poets of the world,”
was born in Mexico in 191-4 His
first book appeared when he was
only 19. Since then he has had a
prolific career.

His books have been translated
into English, French, Greek, Rus-
sian, Swedish, and numerous other

languages including Hindu and‘

Gujarati.

‘In 1963, Paz was awarded the
Grand Prize in the contest pro-

moted by the VI Congress of In- ~.

ternational Poetry in Knokke, Bel-
gium. ~

He has attained international
fame, not only as a poet, but also
as an essayist. His first book of
essays is El Laberinto de la Sole-
dad (The Labyrinth of Solitude -

1950). In ‘the first part of this H

 

work Paz analyzes the personal-
ity of the Mexican people, andin
the second part he interprets the
history of Mexico by using this
analysis. These two themes are
tied together in the well-known af-
terward, “The Dialectics of Soli-
tude.”

Riggle And The Racket

by_BILL NAAB

The University’s number
one tennis player during the
last few matches of the season,
Mike Riggle, isn’t exactly addict-
ed to the net sport.

In high school, Riggle was also

the number one man on the team,
and many observers considered

him one of the_ better players in.

the entire state of Indiana.

When Riggle came here two
years ago on a basketball scholar-
ship, he planned on capturing a
spot on the net squad. But Riggle
never joined coach Pope’s squad
until the end of last season.

According to Riggle, there’s no
‘real reason why he suddenly de-
cided to jump the famed second
team (quality players at the Uni-
versity, who for a variety of rea-
sons are not participating in var-
sity tennis) to join the netters.

“I just felt like playing; before
I didn’t,” said Riggle, who won
one of the three matches he com-
pleted in. »

“There’s no real obligation,” he
continued. The coach couldn’t
even gather a full squad for prac-
tice. Usually only three guys
showed up. The others were work-

mg. - .

No one could blame Riggle fo
being a bit disappointed and pessi-
mistic, despite the sea of respect
Pope has awarded him. Afterall.
the record of the tennis team was
a miserable 0-13.

In addition, Riggle’s basketball
status is uncertain. Coach Buzz
Ridl starts only two big men in
hisisystem, and Riggle (6’4”) has
doubts whether or not he is step-
ping on firm ground. Sophomore
Paul 0’Gorek and three seniors
will be his chief competition next
December.

Some people suggest, however,
that tennis and not basketball may

There’s someone on campus who feels that Jerry Richey
doesn’t run fast enough.

The critic is a guy named Richey.
“‘I don’t have the natural speed,” said the Panther thinclad.

With or without that natural speed, Richey will compete in the
mile-run this weekend at the Na-
tional Federation Meet. It’ll be a
change for the track star who has
been entering the longer races
this spring. ‘

“I haven't done any training for
the mile outdoors,” he said. “I’ll'
be bothered by the lack of speed,

“That depends on whether or
not I go to graduate school. If I
do try, the event will depend on
what I do in the next two years.”

The memory of missing the last
Olympics can’t be very pleasant;
that’s for sure.

Why
Welcome home
Away from home for

If we in Americal can manage it, you'll never have to
leave home. We provide a way of living (or at least
breathing) at a variety of centers we maintain. Call them
what you will— home (mommy. and daddy) high school,
university, family, career, marriage (husband and wife),
retirement, federal penitentiary (for our crooked ones),
hospitals (regular and mental: for our crooked ones).
They’re all part of our extended plant, Americal, a highly
developed construct of centers where you may be detain-
ed, entertained, or more probably will detain yourself.

Why
Welcome

To our prison.

We call this particular branch the University of
Pittsburgh. Its reputation is improving, you know, and
we’re proud of the facilities and personnel. We hope you
will make use of your stay here. Be productive. Of course,
we can’t expect too much joy; a prison’s a prison, but we
hope you don’t spend too muchtime crying over your fate.
It’s a minimum security plant and we know you’ll make

A the most of the time you must do here.

Must‘?

Oh, you know, in Americal we don’t need bars and locks
and coercion. In Americal we do indirectly what is done in
other countries by direct coercion. That’s how General
Hershey puts it. He’s from another center (maximum
security I hear: penalties range from forced in-
stitutionalized apathy to death). Our centers are
independent (who needs conspiracies when we have US?)
but somehow, so horrible and beautiful—all the centers fit
together in a coherent whole. Maybe Mussolini would have
been proud. v "

* * * *

Some of the professional people in Pittsburgh, many of
them from the University, are worried about some of us
going to prison for the draft and/or grass. They think we
have an utterly romantic picture of prison life and that we
will be horribly affected by years in the penitentiary. We
try to explain to them that we arequite realistic about the
whole thing, not quite Gandhian in our exubrance at the
thought of jail, and that we know quite a bit about what
we’re getting into. We plead with them to translate thier
concern about our imprisonment into terms which we, the
ones going to jail ‘are anxious for people to understand. We
tell them about all sorts of jails in Americal. We tell them
that they often do some imprisoning themselves.

But many do not understand. Their’s are split
personalities: they function with one set of imperatives as
religious folk and another set as professionals. They are
alienated from their own true roots. They are US, normal
men. A British shrink,.R. D. Laing, describes them:

LINES WAITING. Not because you have to but because you) think or think you should
think you have to. Waiting: for college, to leave home, for graduate. school, for career,
for marriage (to screw?), for children to grow up, for retirement, for death. Waiting.
There is a good time to stop waiting. Freedom: now.

‘Students Are Niggers

by GERALD FARBER
Teacher, Cal. Institute of Technology

Students are politically disenfranchised. They are in
anacademic Lowndes County. Most of them can vote in
national elections——their average age is about 26—
but they have no voice in the decisions which affect their
academic lives. The students are, it is true, allowed to
have a toy government of their own. It is a government
run for the most part by Uncle Toms and concerned prin-
_ cipally with trivia. The faculty and administrators decide
what courses will be offered; the students get to choose
their own Homecoming Queen. Occasionally, when stu-
dent leaders get uppity and rebellious, they’re either ig-
nored. Dut off with trivial concessions, or maneuvered ex-
pertly out of position.

faculty member “Sir” or “Doctor” or “Professor”—and
he smiles and shuffles some as he stands outside the pro-
fessor’s office waiting for permission to enter. The fac-
. ulty tell him what courses to take (in my department,
English, even electives have to be approved by a faculty
member); they tell him what to read, what to write, what’s
true and what isn’t. Some teachers insist that they enour—
age dissent but, they’re almost always jiving and every
 student knows it. Tell the man what he wants to hear or
' he’ll fail your ass out of the course. '
‘Jump Boy’
When a teacher says “jump,” students jump. I know
of one professor who refused to take up class time for
. A exams. and required students to show up for tests at 6:30
A in the morning. And they did, by God! Another, at exam

 coercive grades or examinations.

M The Open University which was set up last year by Concerned Stu-
E dents and Faculty sought to give people the room to create their own
classes. If you came to class, it was because youiwanted to. If you want-
ed to sleep, read, listen to music, make love, you went elsewhere; We

even pulled it all off in the same room.

Consider the possibility of conducting an English or history survey

' lecture in these settings. Who would pay attention to what?

No one can begin to think, feel
or act now except from the starting
point of his or her ownhalienation.
. . . . We do not need theories so
much as the experience that is the
source of the theory.

—R. D. Laing

   

A student is expected to know his place. He calls a V

WHAT’S A CLASS? A place where there are chairs in rows, teacher in
the front, raised a little (consider why), authority generating from one
person designated ahead of time, with power to punish and control? Or
the creations of real students, people who get together voluntarily,
/without coercion, to discuss problems. With some people having done
more reading than others and therefore helping to direct——but without

time, provides answer cards to be filled out—each one en-
closed in a paper bag with a hole cut in the top to see
through. Student stick their writing hands in the bag while
taking the test. The teacher isn’t a provo: I wish he were.

He does it to prevent cheating. Another colleague
once caught a student reading during one of his lectures
and threw her book against the wall. Still another lectures
his students into stupor and then screams at them in a
rage when they fall asleep.

Just last week, during the first meeting of a class,
one girl got up to leave after about ten minutes had gone
by. The teacher rushed over, grabbed her by the arm, say-
ing, “This class is NOT dismissed!” and led her back to
her seat. On the same day, another teacher began by in-
forming his class that he does not like beards. mustaches,
long hair on boys, or capri pants on girls, and will not tol-
erateany of that in his class. The class, incidentally, con-
sisted mostly of high school teachers.

‘Discouragement’

Even more discouraging than this Auschwitz ap-
proach to education is the fact that the students "take it.
They haven’t gone through 12 years of public school
for nothing. They’ve learned one thing and perhaps only
one thing during those 12 years. They’ve forgotten their
algebra. They’re hopelessly vague about chemistry and
physics. They’ve grown to fear and resent literature. They
write like they’ve been lobotomized. But, Jesus, can they
follow orders! Freshmen come up to me with an essay

and ask if I want it folded and whether their name should

be in the upper right hand corner. And I want to cry and
kiss them and caress their poor tortured heads.

Students don’t ask that orderslmake sense. They give '

up expecting to make sense long before they leave ele-
mentary school. Things are true because the teacher says
they’re true. At a very early age, we all learn to accept
“two truths” as did certain medieval churchmen. Outside
of class, things are true to your tongue, your fingers,-

the Trustees.

your stomach, your heart. Inside class, things are true by
reason of authority. And that’s just fine because you don’t
care anyway. Miss Wiedemeyer tells you a noun is a per-
son, place or thing. So let it be. You don’t give a rat’s ass;
she doesn’t give a rat’s ass.

The important thing is to please her. Back in kinder-

garten, you found out that teachers only love children
who stand in nice straight lines.‘ And that's where it’s
been ever since.

What school amounts to, then, for white and black

kids alike, is a 12-year course in how to be slaves. What‘

else could explain what I see in a freshman class? They’ve
got that slave mentality: obliging and ingratiating onthe
surface but hostile and resistent underneath.

‘Black Slaves’

As do black slaves, students vary in their awareness
of what’s going on. Some recognize their own put-on for
what it is and even let their rebellion‘ break through to the
surface now and then. Others — including most of the
“good students” — have been more deeply brainwashed.
They swallow the bullshit with greedy mouths. They’re

pathetically eager to be pushed around. They’re like those

old grey-headed house niggers you can stiii Ilnd in the
South who don’t see what all the fuss is about because Mr.
Charlie “treats us real good.”

The saddest cases among both black slaves and
:student slaves are the ones who have so thoroughly intro-
jected their masters’ values that their anger is all turned
inward. At Cal State, these are the kids for whom every
low grade is torture, who stammer and shake when they
speak to a professor, who go through an emotional crisis
every time they’re called upon during class. You can rec-
ognize them easily at finals time. Their faces are festoon-
ed with fresh pimples; their bowels boilaudibly across
the room. If there really is a Last Judgment, the parents
an: tltlaachers who created these wrecks are going to burn

We are aware that to avoid platitudes we must ‘ana-
lyze the concrete conditions of social order. But to direct
such an analysis we must use the guideposts of basic prin-
ciples. Our own social values involve conceptions of basic
-principles. Our own social values involve conceptions of
human beings, human relationships, and social systems.

We regard men as infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for reason, freedom, and love.

. . . We oppose the depersonalization that reduces hu-
man beings to the status of things. If anything, the brutal-
ities of the 20th century teach that means and ends are
intimately related, that vague appeals to “posterity’.’ can-
not justify the mutilations of the present . . . . . _Loneliness,

, estrangement, isolation, describe the vast distance be-
tween man and man today. These dominant tendencies
cannot be overcome by better personal management, nor
by improved gadgets, but only when a love of man over-
comes the‘ idolatrous worship of things by man.

—SDS Port Huron Statement

To be radical is to grasp things by the root.
But for man the root is man himself. . . . Man ,
is the highest being for man,,hence . . . the
categorical imperative to overthrow all con-
ditions in which man is a degraded, enslav-
ed, neglected, contemptible being.

' —Karl Marx

   

..      Oakland:

Like universitites everywhere, Pitt has an ambivalent
relationship with its surrounding community. The local
businessmen welcome each new freshman class, its

' pockets filled with Daddy’s money which will soon be re-
distributed along Forbes Ave. Higher education in Ameri-
ca provides economic mobility in’ many ways. On the
other hand, for many Oakland. residents, students are-the

' objects of open contempt and hostility. This gets express-
ed most crudely as hassle on the street. Many long-haired
students prefer toavoid Forbes Ave. on a warm evening

aftera losing Pirates game‘; The students are not alone‘

,” '2 here. Recently a professor was knocked down as he walk-
ed past the Briar Bowl.

The’ friction also takes other forms which are less
obviousbut equally damaging. If you live near school, you

s _likely pay extortionistic prices for some of the worst
housing in the city. If you live a little farther away, you
have your choice between extortion and bad housing.
Your neighbors are likely to be unfriendly and even
closed-minded. A year ago a group from the University
tried to obtain a building on Bates Street to house a co-op,
inwhich membership would be open to the community.
They required for this a zoning change, which the com-
munity defeated with a vicious, anti-Black, anti-Semitic,
anti-student campaign. Incidents such as this one (have
 made it clear that our bad relations with Oakland go be-

’ yond the traditional college’s difficulties with the town.

The deeper trouble begins with the fact that Oakland
is a predominantly working-class community whose mem-
bers have religious, social and political values which con-
flict with those many of us hold. Since we tend‘ to wear
our own, values openly, our very presence is disruptive.
Moreover, since Pitt was a commuter school until a do;-_
en years ago, our presence is still fairly new. Oakland,
then, is a well-established community which the Univer-
sity knocked out of equilibrium. ‘

Tl-IE DEGRADING SYS'l‘EM—To create uniformly
acceptable behavior is the administrator’s burden and he
has a huge apparatus to bring it about. The main gear in
the machine is grades. Psychological studies show that
grades not only do not motivateanyone to learn, but they
have no positive correlation between one’s performance
of a job after college. Grades are positively detrimental
to education because they shift the emphasis in a course
from the teacher’s ability to stimulate his students to
think (which might lead to unpredictable “irregularities”
of behavior) to his power to advance or -fail the students-
a condition exacerbated in large classes. If there is any

Who's the bull goose loony here.

human connection between the professor and the student,
grades pervert it: the reward of a grade merely rein-
forces the’ sense of a thing accomplished to please one’s
judge. Ask your teacher why he grades. Ask him why his
evaluations are in such non-human pseudo-objective
terms of letters (A, B, etc.) or numbers (99, 65). If he’s
honest, he’ll tell you he can’t help it, the orders come from
above. Then ask him if that means he’s only a cog in the
machine, and that he must do something he finds objec-
tionable. Is be aware, does he remember, the pressures
created by grades, the enormous destructive weight
grades place around the necks of college students? May-
be he must be taught: to rebel. '

Not only has Pitt caused a cultural dislocation in Oak-
land, but it threatens physical dislocation as well. The
University is Oakland’s largest landowner, and the land
will eventually be used for university expansion. Even
now, though, with no action by the university itself, peo-
ple arebeing forced out of Oakland. The renovated build-
ings which are everywhere were all rebuiltduring the last
few years. They are designed for students and other uni-
versity people, and the rents are scaled accordingly. The

old residents are unable to move back in. This process of. ’

renovation and displacement has substantially reduced
the availability of older housing in Oakland while increas-
ing the size of the market, so rents have gone up all over.
The University has indirectly,_imposed an economic bur-
den on everyone in Oakland who does not own his own
home. -

But ultimately it all comes back to you. 

ABS'I‘RACT—-

Abstract yourself from everything artificial, from 1'
all the institutions and values which are not your own, ‘and -
you will find yourself frightened and alone. Free. ’ ‘ 

That’s education. -

It might not be so bad for some to propel themselves",
out of the morass of what is not them, to face some of the .
loneliness, dread, fear of the 20th century. You’ll read a. '
lot’ about people who have—Buber, Marx, Silone, maybe 1
even Dylan (liberals will impress you with their withit- 5
ness). But your teachers will have much trouble com-H:
municating to you the need to internalize and personalize j
what you read, for many of them have never done it (that’s '
how they can be such cogs). ‘ ~

You must define your own education. You must pick
your own books. People can suggest things, as we have-'1

Has Pitt brought its troubles with Oakland upon‘ it-ll,
Self? C€I‘t3_lI11y there is a good case to be made that we , ,
have been irresponsible in ignoringour social and e'co- 
nomic effect on the community. This irresponsibility is 
likely to continue, unless students’and other members of ». V
the university insist "that "the administration commit it-“H 
self now to meaningful community relations policies? 
which will improve our relations with Oakland, and pre- ' ' 
vent repetitions of Oakland in the Hill, Shadyside, _and  *‘

the administrative machinery to enforce them on our--~
selves ‘constitutes a minimum University community

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. The central ner-
vous system (CNS) is more markedly affected by alco-
hol than islany other system of the body. The question
whether alcohol is a “stimulant” has long been debated.
Laymen in particular view alcoholic drinks as stimulat-
ing. However, there seems little doubt that alcohol is not
a stimulant but, like other general anesthetics, is a pri-
mary and continuous depressant of the CNS. The apparent
stimulation results from the unrestrained activity of var-
ious parts of the brain that have been freed from inhibi-
tion as a result of the depression of inhibitory control

, mechanisms.

The cortex, however, does not seem to be the part of

the brain that is the most sensitive to the action of alcohol.

» Electrophysiological studies (see Kalant, 1962.) suggest
that alcohol, likebother general anesthetics (see Chapter
3), exerts its first depressant action upon »a more primi-

‘- tive part of the brain, namely, the reticular activating

system. This seems to be the system that is responsible
for much of the integration of activity in the various por-
tions of the nervous system (see French, 1960). Ethanol
depresses this system; the cortex is thus released from

. its integrating control with the result that the various pro-

 Yo: The Touch   0 The'“Bul*leti-

cesses related to thought occur iri a jumbled, disorganiz-

' ’ ‘ed fashion and the smooth operation of motor processes

becomes disrupted. The first mental processes to be af-

.‘»fected are those that depend on training and previous ex-

perience and which usually make for sobriety and self-
restraint. The finer grades of discrimination, memory,

. y i concentration, and insight are dulled and then lost. Confi-
' r _dence abounds, the personality becomes expansive and

vivacious, and speech may become eloquent and occasion-
ally brilliant. Mood swings are uncontrolled and emotion-

— al outbursts frequent. These psychic changes are accom-

panied by sensory and motor disturbances. For example,
spinal reflexes are at first enhanced because they have

‘been freed from central inhibition; as intoxication be-

comes more advanced, however, this first phase of en-
hanced reflex activity is succeeded by a general impair-
ment of nervous function and a condition of general anes-
thesia prevails.

Carefully performed experiments have shown
that, in general, alcohol increases neither mental nor

' physical abilities. Although the individual often firmly be-

lieves that his performance is greatly improved, psy-

chometric tests involving typewriting, target practice,

and complicated mental problems indicate that effici-
ency is, in fact, decreased. Familiar and habitual tasks
requiring less skill, thought, and attention are less mark-
edly affected, especially if they are mechanical in nature
(see Jellinek and McFarland, 1940). However, alcohol
may cause some improvement in performance in special
circumstances; for example, if a person's mental inhibi-
tions prevent him from carrying out a task at which he is
normally skilled, moderate amounts of alcohol, by reliev-
ing the inhibitions, may allow him to function more effec-
tively.
CONTRAINDICATIONS

In hepatic and severe renal disease, alcoholshould
probably not be used. Ulceration ‘of the gastrointestinal
tract and hyperacidity associated with digestive com-

’ plaints are also contraindications. Alcohol should‘ not be

taken by epileptics because it may precipitate convul-
sions. In infections of the urinary tract, alcoholic bever-
ages are to_be avoided. Alcohol should be forbidden abso-

' lutely to patients who had once been addicted to it (see

Chapter 16). In general,_ the_i_ise-of alcohol in the pre-

_‘sence of any particular disease is a matter that vthebphy-._

alcohol, drugs, and you.

PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS IN MAN

When the drug is taken by inhalation of its smoke, ef-
fects occur within a few minutes and the duration of ef-
fect is relatively short; after ingestion, usually of the
more purified resin, one—half to one hour may elapse be-
fore onset of effect, and the influence may persist for
three to five hours. There are no lasting ill effects from
the acute use-of marijuana and no fatalities have ever
been reported. On smoking the drug, there is usually an in-

crease in "pulse rate, a slight rise in blood pressure, and

conjunctival vascular congestion; blood sugar is slightly

elevated; there is urinary frequency without diuresis;.

and dryness of the mouth and_throat as well as nausea,
vomiting, and occasional diarrhea have also been noted.

‘ A marked increase in appetite (especially for sweets) and

hunger are said to be characteristic. The acute physio-
logical effects of marijuana were studied comprehensive-
ly by Allentuck (1944).

The subjective effects of the drug are expuisitely
dependent not only on the personality of the user but also
on the dose, the route of administration, and the specific
circumstances in which the drug is used. The most com-
mon reaction is the development of a dreamy state of al-

terec consciousness in which ideas seem disconnected,
uncontrollable, and freely flowing. Ideascome in dis-

- rupted sequences, things long forgotten are remembered,
and others well known cannot be recalled. Perception is‘
disturbed, minutes seem to be hours, and seconds seem to ~

be minutes; space may be broadened, and near objects

may appear far distant. When larger doses are used, ex-"

tremely vivid hallucinations may beexperienced; these

I are oftenipleasant, but their coloring, sexual or other-

wise, is more related to .the_user’s personality than to spe-
cific drug effects, There are often marked alterations of
mood; most characteristically, there is a feelingof ex-
treme well-being, exaltation, excitement, and inner joy‘-
ousness (described as being “high”). Uncontrollable
laughter and hilarity at minimal stimuli are common.
This is often followed by" a moody reverie, but occasional-
ly the depressed mood may be the initial and predominant
reaction. With the larger doses, panic stated and fear of
death have been observed) the body image may seem dis-
torted; the head often feels swollen and the extremities
seem heavy. Illusions are not uncommon, and the feeling
of\/being a dual personalityimay occur. Even with the
smaller doses, behavior isimpulsive and random ideas
are quickly translated into speech; violent or aggressive
behavior, however, is infrequentx When the /subject is
alone, he is inclined to be quiet and drowsy; when in com-
pany, garrulousness and hilarity are theusual picture.
Given the properly predisposed personality and high

enough dosage, the clinical picture may be that of a toxic ’

psychosis. In studies on cases of prolonged use, subjects
became indolent and nonproductive and showed neglect of
personal hygiene; they quickly lost interest in both assign-
ed vocational tasks and recreational pursuits (Williams
et. al., 1946).

The influence of marijuana on intellectual functions
and on emotional reactions and general personality struc-
ture was studied by Halpern (1946), who concluded ‘that

basic personality structure is not changed and that
thoughts or emotions totally alien to the individual are
not aroused by the drug.

It is difficult not (to) be struck with the remarkable
similarity between the descriptions of the behavioral and
subjective effects of large doses of cannabis and similar

1. descigiptionsl of the psychotogenics such as -LSD, mesca-,
.*l_ine,’§and psylocibin. This is especijallytrugezwhen the more _
:. potent synthetics ‘aroused rather than marijuana itself .,_ 

PATTERNS OF ABUSE

In the United States, marijuana is taken by inhaling
the smoke from cigarettes called “reefers.” Marijuana is
also known as “tea,” “Mary Jane,” “pot,” or “theweed.”
Depending on the purity, it usually takes only one or two
cigarettes to produce the desired effect. Most users limit
their intake and avoid the unpleasant hallucinatory ef-
fects of high dosage.

Since 1937 cannabis has been listed separately un-
der the federal narcotic control laws and its illegal pos-
session or _distribution is subject to the same severe
penalties as are now prescribed for violations of the nar-
cotic laws. It must be admitted that at the time of the pas-
sage of these laws histories from some, but not all, heroin

users indicated that the use of marijuana had preced as

the use of heroin. However, the casual relationship be-'
tween these two events has never been substantiated. In
‘spite of the once-heated interchanges among members of
the medical profession and law enforcement officers,
there seems to be a growing agreement within the medi-
cal community, at least, that marijuana does not directly
cause criminal behavior, juvenile delinquency, sexual ex-
citement, or addiction.
