have to excede and do z-lmvc and
beyond what would be ‘done on any
other campus. Our record do~::3ri’t
tell us we’ve done very well and we-
want to improve that record.”

. Brown said he has “looked at the
possibility’ of competitiveness of
voting.” He said it might be
possible to arrange some kind of

’ contest to give awards to a group or

a dorm hall that has the best voting
percentage.

‘He said other ideas under

consideration are designing a
campai button or having some-
body named “Sidewalk Sam” do
sidewalk chalk drawings at polling
sites to attract attention.
‘ In addition to the goal of
increasing voter turnout, Milani
listed his top priority as “to design
a. pmcess to encourage as many
students ‘as — possible to run for
government office.”

According to past elections

a committee chairman Ron Long,

some ﬁfteen names were on last

year’s SGB ballot—three for,

president and twelve for the board.

Brown said he would like to
increase that number, and he is
trying to reach potential candidates
with advertising, letter to org-
anizations, and the distribution of
handbills.

Three different handbills are
being circulated——one to attract
resident students, one to attract

Greek students and one that

TEHRAN, Iran—Hundreds of thousands of Iranians  A
surged through the heart of Tehran yesterday in a,

mammoth anti-shah protest, a “referendum in the
streets,” that ended without the violence many had feared.

The great march demonstrated that the people want “to

put an end to the dictatorial, authoritarian and corrupt '

regime,” said a key opposition leader, Karim Sanjaby. He
said it was “the best evidence that force cannot stop this
national movement.

Estimates of the number of marchers varied. The army
said 300,000 paraded along the 5‘/2-mile route. March

organizers claimed up to 2 million people took part in the "

six-hour procession. The official Iranian news agency

estimated the crowd at 400,000, but said the march was in v g_ __ .
honor of World Human‘ Rights Day, which was yesterday. . v

The protesters carried thousands of banners . and
placards, many written in English for the benefit of foreign

By The Associated Press

MEMPHIS, Tenn.—Vice Pres-
ident Walter F. Mondale warned
Democrats yesterday that inﬂation
is the Vietnam of the 1970s that will
drive them from power if they fail
to deal with it.

“The Democratic Party in 1978

has to face up to, the problem of
inﬂation..or it will be driven out of
office just as our predecessors were
in 1968 by the Vietnam war,
Mndale told the closing session of
the Democratic midterm conven- ‘
tion. * ‘
Before the ﬁnal session, party
leaders moved/to resolve remaining
disagreements and bring the
convention to a close with a show of
unity, behind the policies of
President Carter. 6

But budget priorities and the
question of who in ' American
society should bear the brunt of the
anti-inﬂation campaign blocked all

attempts to complete the show of -

unity-
“If we don’t lick inﬂation it will

' blunt all-of our efforts at social‘

progress, ’ ’ said ,Mondale.

spectre of inﬂation, Mondalemade

the strongest statement at this
convention of the administ ration’s
case for its determination to reduce
, federal spending. ’'
Trying to bring home_ the
political danger of inflation,
‘Mondale told the delegates that
everyone who campaigned in 1976
got the message from the people to
6 “get, control of inﬂation. Make the
dollar worth a dollar. We’ve got to

respond to that overwhelming

plea.” . Behind the scenes, the
Carter administration earlier yield-
ed to pressure from Sen. Edward
_ M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and
endorsed early enactment of
national health insurance. _

The president spent 18 hours in
Memphis, addressing the opening

session Friday: night and then -

attending panel discussions
Saturday morning on arms control
and inﬂation.

Carter tried to affirm his

commitment to Democratic social
program, but he was unable to
satisfy factions who demanded
more than promises that urban and
poverty programs would not bear
the brunt of his campaign against
inﬂation.

“IT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE." 4 q \ 

Harrisburg and

J The Students .

State Sen. James Romanelli told members of the

0 Pennsylvania Student Association for State-Related
-Universities yesterday that student Lobbying and

writing’ personal letters to state senators and

lb V representatives can help influence the legislature. His

comments make good sense. Letter writing and lob-

» bying makes student visible in Harrisburg and helps

remind legislators that students are part of his con-
stituency that could possibly lead to his deafeat at the

‘ polls.

The addendum that the good Sen. Rommanelli
failed to include is that students must exert them-
selves to write or lobby; students cannot expect
someone else to do the work for them. Such an ef-
fort is rarely forthcoming form students across the
state, who seem content to listlessly accept whatever
fee increase results when the politicians in Harrisburg
decide again and again that higher education is not
that important an item in Pennsylvania’s annual
budget. Politically, students seem to be like solar
energy. They have great potentialas an energy sour-
ce, but no one seerns to be able "to utilize it.

If students again show little interest in the‘ ap-
propriations proceedings in Harrisburgh this year,
the price students are going to pay for their lethargy
could well be the mutilation of the University’s
budget next year». Already, the -statements about
money for Pitt by some legislators can be described
as optimistic and hopeless. If the words of
Represenative-Jelect Rick CheSS,_. Dem.-West End,

can be taken as typical of the feelings of other in the

house, Pitt can look forwardgto rough times during
appropriaton hearing this spring. Chess has said that
Pitt cannot expect any increase in funds from
Harrisburg unless the expenditures of the funds are
not more fully explained. . '

The rhetoric ﬂowing from the Governor-elect’s en-
tourage is not encouraging either. During the guber-
natorial campaign this fall, William Scranton III,
Richard Thornburgh’s running mate, had some
misleading words of cheer with _a Catch-22 attached
for university students. Scranton saidgthat Thorn-
burgh wanted to try to keep Pitt’s budget even with
inflation, but added taht the first concern of Thom-
burgh’s was to correct Pennsylvania’s budget crisis’.
If we read between the lines, we get the message:
Don’t hold your breath waitingsfor an appropriations

Page 6—Monday, December 11, 1978

increase from Harrisburg for the next few years.
Politicans across the state can continue to have the
attitude that they can ignore students when they wish
as long as.students fail to be an effective force at the
polls. If the’ political efficacy of most studentsis what
it seems to be among most Pitt undergraduates,
legislators will never have to worry. Most Pitt
students seem more concerned about the ups and

downs of the Panthers football team on Nov. 2 than '

the outcome of the state elections.

Although students here and ‘elsewhere seem ‘as
deeply asleep as Snow White, there is_no handsome
prince to rescue them in’ this case. Students have to
awaken themselves to the fact that legislators will
continue to underfund the’ University as long as
students are politically moribund. I

If students would wak up and learn that they must
write their representatives and. senators and visit
themto push for more funds for Pitt hey might be
able to end the recent history of tuition increase at
Pitt. When they take this step, students can be
proud that they have finally tried to save themselves
some money. Students could take the first step
toward awareness this Christmas by finding out who

0 their representatives are while they are ‘at home

during the holiday break.

By The Associated Press

0 PITTSBURGH--Snow, bitter

, cold and slippery roads apparently

put the brakes on highway violence
in Pennsylvania » and Ohio yester-

, day as a strike ‘by independent steel

truckers ‘entered its ﬁfth week.
“Right now I don’t believe

. there’s much happening,” a state

police spokesman said from Harris-
burg. “I don’t know if it’s the bad

weather in the western part. of the -

state or not. Maybe that will keep it

“There’s ‘not’ a thing. We’ve got

‘:.snow on the ground,” a police

spokesman said.

Meanwhile, several major steel
companies resume testimony toda
in a suit against FASH. 1'

The suit’ seeks $3 million in
damages from the Pittsburgh-

-- based association in addition to a
$10,000 per day fine for the
duration [of the strike and ﬁnes
against FASH officers and
members.

On Friday, Bethlehem Steel Co.
executive Richard Adams told a
federal jury that a FASH. represen-

tative predicted violence if the

company would not negotiate

higher. rates with its independent
drivers. V B

Adams said he refused an offer

by FASH spokesman Fred Mensing

"and Robert W. Raub to bargain a

new shipping agreement for the
independent haulers servicing

- Bethlehem. - ‘

“Youpeople are taking food out
of our mouths and off our tables,

and money out of our pockets,”"

Adamsltestiﬁed Raub told him.

“Somebody is gonna get hit, and-

somebody is gonna’ get hit hard
with a pipe,” he quoted» Raub "as
saying on a picket line. ’

Adams testified a convoy of‘

trucks leaving the Bethlehem plant
the next day were .‘attacked by
pickets, one of whom tried to hit a
driver. with a pipe..
FASH_chairman William J. ,Hill

took the stand, Friday and testified ‘

that he didn’t" imew M'ensin’gan'd
'didn’t think he was a member of
FASH..

. Hill called‘ the strike in an effort.

to win bargaining rights for an
estimated 30,000 steel haulers who

own and operate, their own trucks.’

Hill, who also seeks streamlined
.road'rules, contends independents
_must now work for rates‘ agreed to
by the Teamsters.

Steel industry attorneys hope to ‘
prove that the current FASH _

organization is the. same one that
called a similar strike in 1970.
U.S. District Judge Louis Rosen-

v  '- The wrong performer headlined

last Thursday's Chaka Khan/Al
Jarreau concert.

, ~ At least that's what much of the
_audience projected during Chaka

Khan's closing set. Several times
as she tried to joke between songs,
a back row voice would scream,
‘-‘Al Jarreau!’.’ This comment was

eventually joined by others like,

“Put Al back on!” or “Rufus!”

' Clearly, Khan was no match for the

spell ‘Jarreau’s performance had
cast.

Jarreau’s set was limited to
about 40 minutes—including an

 _encore—but in that short time

period he used his entire range of
vocal magic. Accompanied by two
keyboards, bass‘ and drums.
Jarreau’s voice supplied the rest of
the music.‘ He's obviouslv influ-
enced by jazz scat-singers like Ella

' Fitzgerald and Jon Hendricks, but

‘Graf Oederland ’

where their scatting imitates saxes
or trumpets, his usually resembles
a Hendrix-like guitar or Afro-
Cuban percussion. This was
demonstrated most effectively
during the encore number, “Take
Five,” where J arreau duetted with
drummer Joe Bell, sounding at
times like’ congas, maracas and
cymbals.
Songs like
Home” and “We Got By” were
transformed into dramatic vig-
nettes, with Jarreau as the lead
actor, pouncing on lyrics and
draining every drop of meaning
from them. The constantly shifting
stage lighting enhanced the effect.

.Iarreau’s between-songs con-
versation added to the rapport his
singing established with the
audience, and he received a
standing ovation after every
number. Khan, on her first solo
tour, couldn't keep up the energy’
level.

By DAVID MAYHER

Graf Oederiand .

’ Directed by Doug Farrell

Pittsburgh Studio Theatre

“Graf 0ederland” is a crime
story in 12 scenes written by Max
Frisch. The play’s ominous tone is
felt from the very beginning, as the
audience enters with a public

. is , isolated _
w surrounded by a number of

in his study and
black-gowned phantoms who man-
ifest themselves throughout the
entire play.

’ By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE

The play’s major theme is a man
atoning for his wasted life,
searching for his identity by
breaking away from the ‘too ordered
world, and ﬁnding freedom.

Frisch succeeds in making his
point by ironically parallellmg the
lives of the public prosecutor and
the murderer. Both. are frustrated-

with their world because it is so .

difficult to do what each really
prefers. ‘

The public prosecutor, portrayed

rehearsed and powerful, so power-
ful that they often overwhelmed
her as she once overwhelmed
Rufus. On one number, she even
stepped back and sang back-
grounds while her brother (the
bassist) sang lead. When Khan did
take center stage on a ballad called
“Roaming Through" the Rushes,”
her voice was deep and mellow,
just as it was during a Rufus
medley of “I’m A Woman,”
“Sweet Thang” and “Everlasting.
Love.” But the audience -responded
lukewarmly-to nearly every song,
probably because of her somewhat
insulting stage manner.

, Early in the set, Khan‘ called the
audience “Philadelphia,” and
mumbled something about Legion-

naire’s Disease. She then found '

-- herself confronting hecklers and a

steadily emptying theater. The
performance seemed to end ab-
ruptly, but there were no encore
calls, just a ﬂood of bodies in the
aisles and out the doors.

hewingl all obstruction with his tiny
ax. ‘

Reilly's acting is enthusiastic
and forceful. He is confronted with
several monologues ' and demon-
strates all through the play that he
_has mastered his character.

The] murderer, played by
Michael Joy, comes across a bit like
the title character in Camus’s “The
Stranger.” Throughout the perfor-
mance, one catches many existen-
tial undertones. . S ' B

Nugent -- aT‘Weekend Warrior’

C’ By M. PATRICK MONAHAN ' "

Ted Nugent " ‘
“Weekend Warriors”.

~ Epic Records

Detroit rocker Ted‘Nug‘ent has a
musical reputation, deserving as it
is, of being one of the hardest-
rocking and crazed guitarists in the

world. i

From his’ day‘. as leader of the
Amboy Dukes‘, a Motor City and

Midwest favorite for years, to his

currently successful ‘solo career,
the energetic Nugent has played
nothing but relentlessly _driven,
high-energy rock ’n’ roll both on
record and in concert. ~

\

His new , album, “Weekend
Warriors,” breaks ,no i musical
ground but will please his group of
hardcore fans. With a new band in
tow, Nugent blazes‘ through new

‘cuts, which feature Nugent’s

trademarks-—-screaming out clear
vocals, tight bass and drum
rhythms, and brutal yet interesting
guitar excursions. ' ‘

Surprisingly," the album's best
song, “Good Friends and a Bottle
of Wine,” captures Nugent in one
of his few mellowmoments.

His music, when played in
concert, drive people eitherto love
him or hate him.

From listening to Nuge-nt’s
animalistic, macho lyrics,’ one
would guess that the musician
must be ,a reflection of his art.

Nothing could be further than thc>—“3'

truth;‘ Nugentis a family man, who

lives aratherquiet life on a farm 
- outside of Detroit. ‘

Nugent, also, has expressed his

views on drugs. ' T

“People always see me cruising

through airports with my long hair '

and strut, and they say ‘There goes
another dope-smoking,’ hippie rock
star,”’ he said. “Man, I hate
hippies, and I’ve had maybe seven

mic Concert for Pitt Students‘?  

g§.

Pitt News Staffwritcr

If you had to judge a concert by the events that
happened before it, the Sea Level concert, sponsored
by the Pitt Union Program Council, probably would
have gone down in the books as one of the biggest
busts in history.. ’

The stage in David Lawrence wasn't set up in time,
people were forced to wait in the rain for more than
an hour and, to top everything else, the Program
Council was not even sure there would be a concert

‘ until late Wednesday afternoon.

Fortunately, you cannot judge a concert before it P

ll3P_PenS. because, all things considered, Sea Level,
, in front of ajammed auditorium, was simply amazing
last Friday night. - _ 

The Macon, Ga.-based band, led by former Allman
Brothers pianist Chuck Leavell, dazzled an audience
of study-weary Pitt students with its style of music, a
blend of jazz and country with a smattering of rock
'n' roll with soul.

Playing tunes from its two albums, “Sea Level”
and “Cats on the Coast,” Sea Level opened the show

with a bluesy tune that highlighted the work of .

Leavell on keyboards and Jimmy Nails and Davis
Causey on electric guitars. From there, Sea Level
remained in same mellow mood, as it performed
“Livin’ in a Dream," which featured Randall
Bramblett on the ﬂute. ,

The concert took on a change from there—the band

‘slammed’: into a song with a tropical beat that
described ,tl,1c ,vi1:tu_es .,of _drinking Pina Coladas.  ._ i_ 

_th'_orougl_1ly, .er_1te_rt_'ained.’ _

Throughout the restlof the evening, the audience

was entertained with an array of musical endeavors

that covered the realm of the world of music within
the decidedly original style of Sea Level. Upbeat
songs that showed roots of jazz, country, soul and
rock '11’ roll. had the crowd on its feet and
surrounding the stage’ by'the c_oncert’s end.

Leavell was the star of the concert. His dazzling
work on the piano and electric keyboard instruments
combined with his vocal work and his fine rapport
with the crowd.

In short, the performance of Sea Level was nothing
less than superb, and the Program Council, even
with the difficulties in the seating arrangements, can
hold its head‘ up high, '

as 1,200 people were

1 Wavelength
Van Morrison V
Warner Bros. Records

Ten years ago the name Van,
Morrison was known by anyone
whoowned a radio. With hits like
“Brown-Eyed Girl” and “Dom-

ino,” he played a major role in the
shaping of modern rock music.
But like Dr. Frankenstein, what

he helped to create was a major

factor in his decreasing popularity.
With: hard-driving rock on the rise,
Morrison’s relaxed style was
pushed aside.

But old stars never die; they just
disappear for a while. They always
come back, whether they continue.
to put out albums or whether they

wait for their annual appearance on
greatest hits of‘ the ’60’s records.
As long as there is somebody
listening, these, late greats will .
continue to record. , .~

For the few remaining Morrison
groupies, his newest release,
“Wavelength,” should give them
something to listen to. It’s‘ not one
of the best albums of the year, but
it also isn’t one of the worst. -

The album is highlighted by

unique vocals. Singing in ‘‘King-:

dom Hall,” Morrison draws from a
raspy, exciting voice that works to

_ become a part of the lyrics. Helped
. also by sweet backg_r_ound- vocals,‘

the V _album rotates ‘around the
singing. ' A  j '

The Stones, after slumping in
recent years with releases like
“Love You Live” and “Black and
Blue” showed they can still rock
harder and better than anyone with
“Some Girls.”
vocals are back to form, his‘ lyrics
still scathing. Best moments on the
album, however come from that
inimitable combination of Bill
Wyman’s bass and Charlie Watts’
drums—as executed in the quasi--
disco cut “Miss You.” “Shat-
tered” and “Best of Burden” are
also excellent tracks.

Billy Joel turned in two album in
the poll’s top ﬁve—“The Strang-

and “52nd Street.” The former
spawned ﬁve top forty singles for
._Ioel—“Just the Way Your Are,”
“Only the Good-Die Young,” “The

Stranger,” “Always a Woman,”
and “Anthony’s Song.”

“Running on Empty” is an
album taped on the road and deals
with the frustrations of _toiii:ing.
Jackson Browne, premiere balla-
deer of the California outlaw school
of music, is the perfect west coast
counterpart of ‘Joel.

released last year, too. And as

album with material good enough

jazz effort of the year by ﬂugelhorn
virtuoso Chuck Mangione. The

New Year’s is a time to ring out
the old and ring in the new; Pitt
seemed to catch the approaching
holiday spirit as it‘ wrung out
Robert Morris College, 100-68, at
the-Field House Saturday night.

At the same time, the Panthers

(4-3}, wereintent upon ringing out
old memories of some not-so-happy
December basketball games in
years past, which for a while
included the annual double-loss in
the now-defunct Steel _ Bowl
Classic. '

The new is ushered in by a team
that doesn’t have to rely on one

. man for all the scoring, that seems

to know what to do with a lead once
it is established and that can draw a
crowd of 2,395 on a snowy weekend
before ﬁnals.

L The outside shooting of Terry
Knight, Dave Olinger and Wayne
Williams pushed Pitt out to a quick

'10-point lead, ‘a margin" that grew 4‘

to 18 before the Colonials’ Hose
Champine went on a scoring
rampage to keep the game from
becoming a total embarrassment
for -Robert Morris by halftime.)
Champine, a one-time Duquesne
Duke who has found stardom in
Coraopolis, was cheered on by an
enthusiastic blue-and-white
pompom-shaking crowd of Colonial
fans seated across from the Pitt
bench. His 34 points (half of the
Colonials’ output) was all the group‘

.could cheer about; no one-else

scored in double ﬁgures, and three
players fouled out of the game.

_ Although both teams averaged
well from the ﬁeld during the first
half (Pitt, 63.6 percenti. Robert
Morris, 50 percent), the Panthers’
superior rebounding, particularly
onoffense; allowed them to take
the high-percentage shots.

“Those second shots by  Pitt
were what killed us,” said Colonial

coach Tom Weirich. “I was pleased‘-

that ‘we shot 50 percent during the
ﬁrst. half, which is our best all
season, but we were beat on the
boards.”

Once again, Sam Clancy pre-
sided as “chairman of the boards,”
where he collected 14 rebounds and
was followed by Knight with 10.
Clancy, who said he was still upset
about his mother being‘ in the
hospital, took out his frustrations
on Robert Morris early in "the game
when he slammed an attempted
Colonial shot to the floor.

Although those rejections gener-
ated enthusiasm from a generally
quiet crowd, they couldn't match
the uproar caused by Panther subs-
Dave Underwood and Bobby Jones,
who combined to sink Pitt's ﬁnal
six points of the evening.

“I was happy with the way they
(the substitutes) went out and
really moved the ball around,” said
coach Tim Grgurich. “They
weren’t afraid to shoot, and they
handled Robert Morris quitewell.
Our freshmen have been proving
themselves. I really believe that

before this year isiover, they are

going to be ready to see a lot" of
action.”

Sam Clancy makes ‘his move“ to the glass.

Two of those freshmen, guards
Scott Grevey and Duane Wallace,
scored seven and six points,
respectively; Wallace also had
three rebounds.

The Panthers, have yet to be
outrebounded this season; the
Colonials did well against the taller
Panthers, however, "and pulled
down 38 rebounds, nine less than
Pitt.

So what’s new about the Pitt
Panthers this year? Just about

‘everything. New regulars, inclu-

ding ‘Sammie Ellis and "Carlton
Neverson, a new, balanced scoring
attack (12 players registered points
against Robert Morris), the fact
that the team is winning the games
that in years past they should have
but didn’t. What more is there to
say? ‘

Happy New Year.

 Victory Over Colts Leaves Steelers Home for the Holidays

Pittsburgh claimed .the home-ﬁeld advantage for the
duration of the playoffs by burying the Baltimore Colts,

Tonight: Cincinnati at Los Angeles

41,9S7._who scorned the warmth of their living rooms and
came out to see Pittsburgh raise its record to 13-2 with the
season ﬁnale to be played at Denver on Saturday.

This was the week the Steelers were supposed to be
primed for an upset. The divisional crown was in the bag,
Earl Campbell now knew what was meant by DEE-Fense
and the'blue-and-white pompom was put out to pasture
along with Bum’s ropes. The opponents were the lowly
Colts,‘ winners of but ﬁve games duringthis elongated
season and forced to play without their version of “the
franchise,” quarterback Bert Jones.

Then there was the weather.

None of this made any difference, however, for the
Steelers racked up nearly 400 total yards without the
beneﬁt o'f skiis; Terry Bradshaw completed 11 of 18 passes
for 240 yards and three touchdowns, which meant bettors
who bought the letdown theory and took the Colts with the
points should be hearing from their bookies shortly.

“Being from the South, I found out real quick here one
year that you can have some fun throwing the ball in the
snow if you can hold onto it,” said Bradshaw. “We threw
everything at them. Every play I called was wide open.
What happens is you get hot and everything keeps
working.” M

Mainly, what has been working for the Steelers this year
is a changed attitude. Gone are the days of bickering and

complacency. The team that has tasted the glory afforded .

champions wants to return to the pinnacle it occupied in
1974 and 1975. ._ '

“The thing! like is that we had such a physical game at
Houston last week, and we seemed to bring it back with
us,” said Bradshaw. “We very easily could have sat down,
but I think everybody was excited about playing.”

\

For middle linebacker Jack Lambert, the excitement
doesn’t stop, even though the division and the home ﬁeld
have been clinched. If the Broncos expect to have an easy

time of it next week, they are in. for a rude‘ awakening, . 1

according to Lambert.
‘ ‘ ‘From the feeling I get around this locker room, there is
revenge on our minds,” said Lambert. “They took it away

. from us last year. We could be playing Denver later in "the

playoffs, so it’s important to keep our tempo going.”
Bradshaw isn’t adverse to playing the spoiler role,
either. '
“Denver always has beaten us before, and I'm sure they
will need this game more than we will,” said Bradshaw.
Early in the season, the offense seemed to be able to
score at will while the defense was getting adjusted. Then,
Bradshaw and the rest of the offense went through a minor

slump, but then the defense picked up and began ,

slamming the door like the Steel Curtain of old. Lately,
everything seems to be coming together.

“We’re playing well as a team,” said Bradshaw. “We
lose the ball, and,we know we're going to get it back.
Nothing seems to bother us. You have to have that kind of
conﬁdence, and we have it right now.”

STEELER NOTES: Kick returner Larry Anderson is the
ﬁrst dangerous man the Steelers have had receiving
kickoffs for some time. With the score 28-13, Anderson
returned Toni Linhart’s kick 57 yards and set up the
Steelers at the Colt 18. Bradshaw hit Randy Grossman with
a 12-yard touchdown pass three plays later...Pittsburgh
will have a two-week rest before-its ﬁrst playoff game

I either Dec. 30 or 31. The AFC Championship game will be

played Jan. 7 in Three Rivers Stadium if the Steelers win
in the ﬁrst’ round.

between them, Hebert said. Pitt
and Rutgers each won two matches

 

Hebert’s squad then played its best
match of the ‘tournament in a
comeback win over host Alabama
11-15, 15-13, 15-11.

“That was an” important win,”
said Hebert. “There was a big
crowd and Alabama was ranked
ninth  a preseason poll.”

Pitt then played 10th-seeded
Texas-Arlington and lost 15-8,
15-13*. “We didn.’t play particular-
ly well-,” said Hebert. “It was a
disappointing loss.”

San Jose was the Pantherette
next competion and, according to
Hebert, “Pitt didn’t play well at
all” in losing to the Spartans 15-4,
15-8. “They were the first
California team we'd ever played, ’ ’
said the coach, “and perhaps the
girls were intimidated by them.”

At Pitt, only two things could
make a victory against Robert
Morris something other than a win
by forfeit: a small amount of sweat
and a great deal of fun.

The only sweat generated by the
Panthers at the Field "House
Saturday night seemed.to be the
resultof slam dunks, and a fair
amount of fun (capped by the
second group of substitutes’
rousing last-minute rally) ac-
companied Pitt’s cruise past the
Colonials, but there was little
back-slapping in Pitt’s locker room
after the game.

And that is a good thing for Tim
Grgurich’s Panthers, who are quite
unlike any Pitt team of recent
years. ' _

The most-.. noticeable difference
involves play. This team per-
forms— and, through four games,
has won—as a team. Despite Sam
Clancy's menace and Terry
Knight’s productivity, no Panther
has been or wishes to be a star.
Instead, the Panthers are content
to shine collectively and that

Pitt now faced second-seeded
"Hawaii, a magnificant team,
according to Hebert, and the
Pantherettes were shut out in the
ﬁrst game 15-O. “If you can lose
15-0 and still feel that you played
well...well that’s what we did,”
said the- coach. “We weren’t
psyched out. We played well, but
they were just that good.”

In game two, Pitt changed its
defense and actually jumped out to
a 8-2 lead before the Rainbows
came back to tie the game at nine,
and then take control, winning
15-9. This loss dropped Pitt’s pool
record to 2-3 and all hopes of
championship play vanished.

In the -two previous years, the
two Eastern teams together won
only 2 games (not matches)

and four games. ,

“The East traditionally ﬁnishes

last at nationals,” said Hebert.

“We (Rutgers and Pitt) ﬁnished

The players of this team may not
possess the boundless potential for
individual brilliance that belonged
to players such as Larry Harris and
Sonny Lewis. 2

But they own four easy wins and
the prospect of many more.
Why? “No one here has his
suitcase packed,” observed Pete
Strickland, a guard whose. sight is
as keen off-court as it is during a
game. “We’re a team.”

The difference, thus, -between
the’basketba1l teams of Pitt and
Robert Morris was as pronounced
as the difference between the
Cathedral of Learning and a mangy
downtown office building (such as
the one that houses Robert Morris
College). .

Mick Morton, 6-8 forward who is
one of the Colonials’ big guns,
went to high school with Strickland,
and Morton has gone to college
with many other people. This is
Morton’s ﬁfth year of school, and
Robert Morris is his ﬁfth college.

Perhaps more talented, though
just a bit less travelled, is Hosea
Champine, whose 34 points’ gave

Robert Morris half its scoring.

Champine and Morton would
have been excellent additions to

  Wrestlers Place Second in Eastern Eight Tournament

WASHINGTON, D.C.——Pitt
wrestlers Glenn Maxwell (‘I18
pounds), Ed Bredniak '(150) and
Jim Gordon (167) won - their
respective weight championships
to pace the Panthers to a
second-place ﬁnish in the ﬁrst
Eastern Eight Tournament last
weekend.

Jose Martinez (126 pounds) and
heavyweight Steve Smocharski
placed second in their weight
classes to earn Pitt 119‘/2 points,
10‘/2 less than winner Penn State in
a down-to-the-wire ﬁnish.

“We had a poor start,” Panther
head coach Dave Adams said. “But
I thought our guys came back
pretty well. We just fell short.”

After the ﬁrst half of the
four-session event, the Nittany
Lions led by 20 3/4 points and
seemed sure of clinching the team
title. A _ *

In the ﬁrst round, all but three

  Pantherette Tankers Destroy MSU

By LINDA VENZON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s swim team
ﬁnished the preseason with a 3-1
record by defeating Michigan
State, 90-41, Saturday at Trees
Pool. The Pantherettes won 11 of
15 events and broke three team
records with its expected victory.

“This is the best team we’ve
ever had,” said head coach Dick
Bradshaw. “We’ve never had four
all-American swimmers on the
team combined with some fresh-
men who have the potential to
make all-American.”

Five swimmers won at least two
individual events, and two of these
were freshmen. Pantherette Judy
Klotz won the 500-yard freestyle

and 100-yard backstroke, and Linda A

Frankenbach won both the 50-yard

backstroke and 200-yard freestyle.

The Pantherettes are stocked for
the upcoming season with all-
who
qualiﬁed for nationals while win-
ning the 50- and 100-yard butterﬂy
events, Suzanne Pulley ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the 50-yard breaststroke

American Kathey Stetler

and 100-yard individual medley,

and Patty Davis won the 50- and

100-yard freestyle events. _

Michigan State showed its
strength by winning both diving
events and the 100-yard breast-
stroke. Even though the swimmers

were permitted to choose most of

their events, the Pantherettes were
as powerful as ever.

‘ ‘We switched the lineup to try to
get the girls to make national
qualiﬁcation times,” said Brad-
shaw, “and we’ve made more

national times this year than any
other.”

especially since she's a walk-on,” V

said Bradshaw. “Almost all of our
freshmen have been recruited.”

V caﬁ within seconds of earning the

chance to tie Slippery Rock after a
dramatic comeback in the second
round of the Pitt Invitational
‘Saturday. _ After Slippery Rock’s
unsuccessful free-throw attempt,
the Pantherettes gained control of

the ball but their time ran out. The
game ended in a 67-65 loss for Pitt.

The momentum changed hands
throughout. The Pantherettes
were able to gain control a number
of times, except when it was
needed most in the ﬁnal three
minutes of playing time.

The Pantherettes had problems
putting theball in the hoop in the

ﬁrst half, although they displayed
an aggressive defense. Pitt came

Tankers Scale Major Obstacles

By.KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

According to co-captain Bob
Clemmer, Pitt’s swim team (1-0) is
“over its major obstacles” and
prgbgbly is only a meet or two away
fro’?! another undefeated season.

“Barring unforseen injury or
illness, I don’t think anyone is
going to stop us,” said Clemmer, a
senior from Philadelphia. “We
defeated North Carolina and
ﬁnished first at the Penn State
relays. Those probably were our
two toughest meets of the year.

“Ohio State (Jan. 13 at Trees
Pool) and Maryland (Jan. 27) could
give us some trouble, especially
Maryland since we’re meeting
them at their pool,” Clemmer
continued. “But I still don’t see us
losing a meet this year. When
we’re right, no one can stop us.”

Clemmer cannot seem’ to say
en@h about his team.

“We’re cocky—no, make that
conﬁdent in a good sort of way. We
know what to do and we go out and
do it, but we also are very
intelligent. We can detect when
something is wrong. '

“We will be nationally ranked,”
Clemmer concluded.

Pitt was 10-0 in dual meets last
season—its best record in 30
years—but did poorly in the NCAA
Championship and_ consequently
was not ‘nationally ranked.

freshman Sandy Pidgeon and Mark

Pitt’s last all-America in swim,-

“We have some excellent

looking forward to making all-
America in the 400-yard medley
relay. “Talent-wise, we all are
close. We can stick another guy

into an event and probably still
win.” _

Clemmer and Mark Schuman,
also part of the 400-yard medley
relay team, are team captains.
