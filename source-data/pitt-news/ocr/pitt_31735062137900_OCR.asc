Dome - Of - Plaster Feature
Requiring Stereopticon Stage
Sets Among Changes Made

A The ﬁnal plans for the stage of the
Stephen Collins Foster Memorial, over
which there has been considerable dis-
cussion, have ﬁnally been ﬁnished and
approved, according to John Weber,
business manager of the University.
Carl B. Cass, director of dramatics,
was one of the early objectors to the
original plans for the stage. He claim-

ed the stage would be too small for
large musical productions as the Cap;
and Gown, and utterly unsuit'ab’le for?
productions of the Pitt.--.Players.

A small dome of plaster-in the mid-{
dle of the sta.ge wasthe leading faulté
in the stage design. This shell-like‘
structure required the use of project-;
ed scenery through stereopticon slides 2
on its walls. Using this type of scen-E
ery, furniture and other stage accesso-
ries could not be used inside the pro-]
jection line as they would cast:
shadows. The actors would have only
about eight square feet of st.age in
which to perform. If they went down
the stage, they would break the con-
tinuity of the scenery; it being pro
jected on their costumes.

Inadequate lighting facilities from
the auditorium of the theater for spot-
ting the stage and the excess back-
stage space taken by two stairways
were other objections to the original;
plans for the theater, -' f

In the ﬁnal plans as now approved
all these objections. have been re
moved. Although the original size of
the stage has not been altered much,
the new plans present a type of stage
more suitable to general dramatic and
musical productions. The dimensions
are, proscenium, 27 feet wide; height,
40 or 50 feet; width of stage, 54 feet,
and the depth about 34 feet.

Criminologist Assails Police
‘Torture’ Methods As ‘illegal’

 

Dr. Root Scores “Social Condemnation Of Sex” As Cause
Of Robert Edwards’ “American Tragedy” Case

By Roman Lapica

Branding the third degree as a “sub-
stitute for brains,” Dr. Vvilliam T.
Root, criminologist and head of the
department of psychology, assailed the
entire American system of crime pro-
cedure in an interview yesterday.

“The policy Of lining up a. prisoner
and attempting to coerce him into
answering questions until he drops
is illegal,” Dr. Root declared. “Tor-
turing a prisoner into confessing a
crime does not necessarily prove his
guilt. I am in favor of eliminating
the third degree from our system of
criminal procedure.”

Lack of intelligence on the part of
police, laxity of judges and district
attorneys’ willingness to secure con-
victions on any grounds were the
causes Dr. Root gave of the wide-
spread use of the third degree.

“The jury was instituted to try the
case for the ﬁrst time publicly and im-
partially,” Dr. Root stated. “By using
the third degree police assume their
prisoner guilty and secure evidence
which is illegal and often forced out
of the prisoner who wishes only to es-

cape further physical torture.”

Commenting on the present Haupt-
mann case, Dr. Root said:

“The kidnaping has been played up
so much that the public demands a.
conviction. Police will move heaven
and earth to fasten the crime on some
one, and I’m afraid that little cour-
tesy will be used.”

Blaming the Robert Edwards case
on “social condemnation of sex,” Dr.
Root declared:

“VVere sexual irregularity treated
sympathetically as well as being con-
demned by society, Edwards might
have had the courage to discuss his
difficulties with an older person and
perhaps this tragedy may never have
occurred.”

Despite the state’s willingness to

sentence a person to death on purely
circumstantial evidence, the same
thing may happen again under similar
circumstances, Dr. Root said. He
added:
, “How can emotional adolescents be
expected to abide by laws and rules
when the same acts are committeed
daily by mature persons?”

‘Mayor For Month’
Reveals Secrets
At Forum Today

“McNair Needs No Defense,’ ’
Director Of Public Works
Johnston Says In Interview

Declaring that he learned more in
three weeks as Mayor of Pittsburgh
than he did in four years at Yale,
Leslie J. Johnston, director of public
works in the City, comes to the Uni-
versity today to describe his experi-
ences to the Inquiry forum.

Mr. Johnston, who was appointed
deputy mayor during William N. Mc-
Nair’s absence in September, will “of
course say something about the pres-
ent mayor.”

“But I will not defend the mayor,"
Mr. Johnston said. “He needs no de-
fense.”

According to the public works direc-
tor, Mr_ McNair is the “best man
Pittsburgh had in the 32 years I’ve
been here.” He added:

‘‘I’m not a single taxer.”

Pertaining to a matter of “vital” in-
terest to University students, Mr.
Johnston said: '

“Certainly I was responsible for
sending policemen to ‘clean up’ the
rotten immoral conditions in Pitts-
burgh parks.” .

Commenting on today’s address Mr.
Johnston said:

“My talk will include a discussion
of various functions of city govern-
ment. One must realize city govern-
ment is a great billion dollar business
and not a political institution.”

The Inquiry forum will meet‘ at
12:30 o'clock in Room 107, Alumni

Eesiearch Workers Battle
Valiantly At Science
Of Shoe Tossing

"Where none admire, ’tis useless to
excel.”

This vainglorious philosophy is not
prevalent, however, among a certain
indomitable little group of Mellon “In-
stitute research workers who spend
countless hours daily “excelling”—-
also sweating—on the lot at the rear
of their building at Thackeray and
O’Hara streets.

VVhen a reporter from the l\Iews ac-
cidentally and unintentionally ven-
tured near the spot, he was attracted
by intermittent, metallic “clinking”
sounds, which he imagined were
caused by Institute inmates throwing
test tubes at each other in moments
of pique. Upon further investigation,
he discovered that the sounds issued
from the center of a group of Institute
horseshoe aspirants. He watched dis-
passionately at ﬁrst, but his passive
interest was soon converted to ad-
miration_ He was astonished at the
unerring, even diabolical accuracy
with which those scientiﬁc gentlemen
could hurl horeshoes, and he felt con-
strained to write a feature. Two
trip-le-ringers in an hour's time is no
mean accomplishment.

One erudite participant, explaining
the phenomenal pitching, said, “Scien-
tists have the best natural qualiﬁca-
tions in the world for this sort of
thing. Accuracy is a trait common to
the species. That’s why we're all so
damn good.” He then proceeded to
throw a fluke into the grandstand.

Incidentally, these stellar perform-
ers issue no challenges because they
feel they are “too good to bother with
amac‘n_oors.”

Club, Riﬂes

According to William E. Brinker,
coach of the cheerleaders, a special
cheering section within the student
section will be reserved for the mem-
bers of the Pitt Riﬂes and the Men's
Glee club for the coming U.S.C. game
at the Stadium Saturday, at the inde-
pendent request of these organiza-
tions. They promise to p-ut on an ex-

Stanley Rogaliner, BA, will be
chairman of the Sophomore Hop, the
executive committee of the Univer-
sity Assembly decided late yesterday
afternoon.

Chosen from a group of 22 ap-
plicants for the position. Rogalinor
was one of three selected in the first
eliminations to appear before the ex-
ecutive body. The other two choices
of the committee on appointments
were Harvey Goldstein, C‘, and Robert
McClellan, C.

Monday afternoon, the appoint
ments body, consisting of Don Camp-
bell, ‘C35, chairman, Leonard Marks,

C35, Jane Booth, C36, Joseph Rodgers,
C36, and Robert Ayars, professor of
accounting met to interview all appli-
cants for the position. -

 

“Why do you think that you are

Stlldentsz qualiﬁed to act as chairman?” was

participated in the YM-YWCA retreat; the wading question asked of each
held Saturday and Sunday at Trinity ; candidate,

Manor, according to the report of Ed-
ward Brethaucr, C35, co-chairman
with Beatrice Foster, C35. The re-

treat was led by VV. W. l\’Iendenhall,'

executive secretary of the YMCA, and
Dr_ Ve-tnon Pauck, of the Chicago
Theological seminary,

The purpose of the retreat, accord-
ing to Mr. Menclenhall, is to provide
a limited number of students with the
opportunity to talk at leisure in dis-
cussions with a man of outstanding
ability.

The program included a series of
open forums led by Dr. Pauck, periods
for recreation, and informal teas and
suppers. In the sessions with Dr.
Pauck an attempt was made to obtain
an intelligent approach to present so-
cial, spiritual, and personal problems
with which students are confronted.

On Sunday morning a worship serv-
ice was led by Sarah Marie \Vood,
C37, a member of YWCA cabinet.
This was followed by the ﬁnal discus-
sion period with Dr. Pauck at which
time he stressed the necessity for
students to cultivate a sense of con-
tinuity, a historical perspective,‘and
a religious attitude.

The students returned to Pittsburgh
carly Sunday evening to attend Dr.
Bernard C, Clausen’s service at the
First Baptist church.

 

University Libraries Use
Munn’s Psychology Texts

Dr. Norman L. Munn, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology, today has two
psychological works in the libraries
of universities throughout the coun-
try, The second printing of Dr.
Munn’s “An Introduction to Animal
Psychology” was issued recently. The
volume, first published by Houghton
Mifflin company, has since been ac-
cepted for use in 30 universities and
colleges.

The University bookstore published
“A Laboratory M,anual gin Exp-eri-
mental Psychology” by Dr. Munn.
The manual is now use-d in the
psychology classes at the University,
at the University of Vermont, Clark
university, University of Virginia, and
Skidmore college.

Dr. Munn’s treatise on “Color-
blindness in VVhite Rats,” given as a
talk at Columbia university on Sep-
tember 8, will be published in the
December issue of the “Journal of

give the participants a background for
maintaining their present positions as
successfully as possible, to provide
experience in solving daily problems
and to furnish them with methods of
work and goals of achievement. The
meetings are held on the eleventh
floor of Kaufmann’s, Monday evenings
from seven to nine o’clock in the form.

hellenic freshman reception is to take
place in the evening; in previous
years the reception was held in the
afternoon following classes.

Other queries, including those on
previous experience, campus activi-
ties, and committee choices of the ap-
plicant, were part of each interview.

The new system of choosing dance
chairman is a departure from that of
previous years, when Student Council,
without interviewing prospective lead-
ers, voted upon their choices through
a preferential ballot.

Junta has about 35 members and in-
cludes every woman president on the
campus. The first meeting of the
council will be announced soon by
Miss Hel‘en Rush, assistant dean of
women.

This is the story of Benny Harris,
a freshman who wanted to be known
as a regular guy, and how Benny led
with his bankroll in the ﬁrst round of
his hectic encounter with the frater-
nity boys and subsequently went down
for the count.

Benny owned 3. Plymouth roadster,
boasted the most complete collection
of mauve and yellow neckties on the
campus, and ﬂaunted an allowance of
25 dollars a week above expenses. All
of which served to raise him to the
level of deity, or at least as close to
deity as a freshman can get without
dying before his year is up. But
even the gods know moments of hum-
bleness, and Benny was nothing if
not humble when Joe Slocum, whose
calling card with the initials of honor
societies strung out after his name
resembles the Roosevelt recovery pro-
gram, spoke to him in the following
manner:

“Benny, I’ve been watching you
ever since you ﬁrst set foot on_the
campus and I think that you’re a
pretty regular guy. Because of this,
I am going to invite you to the game
Saturday. I'll buy the tickets and the
gas and get you a date with a beauti-
ful blond who is just dying to meet
you. I am doing this, Benny, ’not be-
cause I am trying to get you to pledge
Psi Psi, which happens to be my fra-
ternity and is the best on the campus,
but because I think you're such a regu-
lar guy.”

Embarrassed, Benny looked down
at his size ten feet and somehow man-
aged to gulp his thanks.

The, following Saturday, Benny
picked up Joe, and together they
went to get the girls, When they got
there, J'oe said, “Benny, I'll go in and
see if they’re ready and you go
around the corner and get some gas.
Get the tank ﬁlled and I’ll pay you

Senior Woman
Takes General
Assembly Seat

Marion Epping, Member Of Now
Defunct Student Council,
Fills SFA Position

 

Because of constitutional incom-
petency, the Executive committee of
the University Assembly yesterday
postponed the appointment of a mem-
ber of the general body to the vacan-
cy in the executive group. The ap-
pointment was accordingly referred

to the meeting of the University As-
sembly_

Marion Epping, C35, and a member
of -Student Council last year, became
a. member of the Assembly, however,
as the Executive committee moved to
ﬁll the vacancy in the larger group.

A change in the previously an-
nounced date of the ﬁrst meeting
of the University Assembly was de-
cided. A dinner meeting at which
Dr. John G_ Bowman, C'hancellor of
the University, will speak, has been
arranged for October 23 instead of a
date earlier in the month.

Turning to the other business be-
fore them, the committee then inter-
vlewed candidates nominated by the
Appointments sub-committee for the
chairmanship of the Soph Hop.

A report of the Social committee,
lead by Charles Herald, C36, and
plans for the Friday pep assembly
were considered.

The assembly will occupy the fourth
hour, during which all classes have
been suspended. Mr, Harrison will
speak shortly after 11 30 o’clock and
will go directly from the assembly to
greet the arriving Southern California
squad at Pennsylvania station.

According to a message received
yesterday by Mr_ Biddle, at least one
Southern -California rooter will be
present; although the main body of
Trojan players and rooters will not
reach P‘ tsburgh in time for the as-
sembly. Dr. Ludovic Fleishacker,
known in his undergraduate days as
“Strangler” and in 1915 captain of the
coast school’s football team, will pre-
sent a strictly Vvestern point of view.

‘Fogbound’---A True Tale
Of A i7‘reshman’s Social Woe

Benny Harris Finds That Being ‘Regular’ Entails Buying
Gas, Tickets; Toting Dumb Blondes To Games

 

 

when you get back.”

Benny got the gas, parked his car,
and waited, For 25 minutes he
waited, reﬂecting that if punctuality
were the virtue of kings it had, by
some metamorphosis known only to
lexicographers, become the vice of
co-eds, But, eventually they came.

As Benny helped Sally Witz into
the car he could not help noticing that
she was blond only by the grace Of an
abounding op-timism—an optimism
that owed much of its potency to fre-
quent dilution with peroxide. There
was a cluster of freckles about Sally's
nose as if she’d been splashed with
mud and she didn’t wear the seams
to her stockings straight. But Benny
was a philosopher: when he met a.
situation that he could do nothing
about, he did it.

All the way to the game she raved
about Cab Calloway, which griped
Benny considerably——he preferring
Jan Garber. Then, too, Joe said noth-
ing about paying for the gas and,
when they arrived, was equally neg-
lectful of the tickets.

Once they were seated, Sally con-
tinued to gobble about Cab Calloway
and Benny got so confused that he be-
gan to yell, “C’mon, Cab, we want a
touchdown.” It happened that the
rivals had a halfback of that nick-
name who was pounding the line with
all the blithe abandon of an hydraulic
hammer, and so Benny got a storm of
glowerlng looks from the upperclass-
men ot‘ his school who were in the
grandstand.

Everything considered, he didn't
have a very good time and it wasn’t
any wonder that when Benny got to
bed that night all he could do was
toss around and moan. His moans
resolved themselves into phrases
just like this: “Just a regular guy.
Just a regular guy.”

A Contemporary Fever
BOUT ONCE EVERY autumn
students of the University in-
terrupt the regular custom of
Monday classes to form long
cheering queues on the campus.
The demonstration is apt to occur
on the ﬁrst Monday after the last
Saturday on which the Panthers
have won a brilliant football
game.

Although each occasion differs
from another, the necessaries of
this rite seems to be: fair weather
(dampness inhibits), not to say a
tinge of frost and a smell of
fallen leaves, as well as the popu-
lar belief that the most glorious
of all possible victories has been
won two days previous.

It is the one day, seemingly,
when the watchers in the grand-
stand can identify themselves
with the lettermen; and seventeen
new students apply, belatedly,
for the freshman football team.

Of course there is room for
only one celebration like this in
any year’s cycle. Sometimes the
campus has shot its wad for an
impressive victory, only to feel
like one who has eaten too many
hors d’oeuvres when a more im-
pressive victory occurred the fol-
lowing week. This may cause
emotional frustration.

Only the deeper logic of mass
instinct determines these occa-
sions, and yet it is probable that
anything like a Pitt victory over
Southern California will set off
such a Monday holiday. There is
a feeling that the Trojans in
other years have failed to appre-
ciate the brand of football played
in this valley as much as the
burned-out East does.

There is a feeling that forgets
the rest of Pitt’s schedule and,
for one thing, overlooks the threat
of Minnesota’s greatest team.

This question of when we shall
eat our cake—now, then, or after
the season is over——might proper-
ly abide with the University As-
sembly. Not later than Friday,
we think, it should announce a
football holiday for Monday,
“win or lose.”

 " As Others See It

fl-IO‘SE WHO lL;OOK to the Unive.r-
sity of Chicago for leadership in
educational experiments will be sur
prised to see occuring this week what
appears at ﬁrst glance to be a step
backward.

After three years under the new
plan, using a grading system com-
posed only of the letters S (satisfac-
tory), U (unsatisfactory), and R (in-
sufficient evidence to justify a grade),
the university has decided it had bet-
ter go back to the very old-fashioned,
A, B, C, and E method.

‘This has been done, we are assured.
not because students or faculty were
dissatisﬁed with S’s and U’s. On the
contrary, ‘a poll of the campus last
year showed that new plan students
were well content with the new mark-
ing system. Since the performance
of a student in any individual course
had no bearing on his degree status,
the grades recorded were only for his
own information. Even a S or a U
probably told him too much for his
own good.

The trouble was that other colleges
and universities. not yet having seen
the educational light, looked askance
a.t Chicago’s meagre ratings, and stu-
dents who wanted to transfer from
Chicago (if there could be any such)
got into difficulties "that must have
been harrowing. So the university
brought back the elsewhere-respected
ABC’s.

This introgression in method will,
of course, have no effect on the spirit
of the new plan at -Chicago. Eventu-
ally, declares the Daily Maroon, grades
will be modiﬁed throughout the coun-
try, and the whole new system will be
universally adopted. But the univer-
sity has found what it means to play
a lone hand; somebody else can do
the pioneering for awhile.-——'1‘he Mich-

Orozco’s Dartmouth Murals
By Herrymon Maurer

 

HE SEPTEMBER COPY of the Art Digest carries an attack, not

digniﬁed by any analysis or reason, upon the Mexican artist, Jose
Clemente Orozco, and upon Dartmouth college.

Orozco has painted vital, moving frescoes; Dartmouth hired him

to paint them; and that portion of the art world that looks with

horror upon such vitality and with especial horror upon a painter

who has identiﬁed himself with an American civilization far older
than English North-American civiliza-9

tion began to proclaim the unsuitabil-
ity of the frescoes and their lack of
true artistic qualities before any of
the work appeared.

In the Art Digest article of analysis
or reason, as I have said, there is
none; of polemicizing and proclaim-
ing there is much. Orozco is attack-
ed because something he has spoken
about, art does not agree with the
opinions of the author of the article,
Mr. H. M. Vvatts. His color is too
high, his forms uu-American (Forms
of the oldest Americans are 'l.lI1-AIllel'-
ican! What is meant is that the
writer of the Art Digest article con-
siders the forms at variance with his
conception of what is suitable for the
tender minds of European inimi-
grants.) '

Besides, Orozco has attacked the
sacred and nourishing idea of nation-
alism and has not represented Jesus
with proper docility. Finally, the
frescoes are unsuited to quiet, passive
New England.

In the October issue of the New
Republic, Mr, Lewis Mumford, a writer
and critic who demands attention be-
cause of the organic unity of his
thought, has disposed carefully and
thoroughly of the last objection. He
shows how the invitation to Orozco
came out of a tradition opposed to the
dead tradition commonly associated
with New England. The tradition
which nourished Emerson, Thoreau,
and Hawthorne “has never hesitated
to go elsewhere for elements that are
lacking in its local scene . . . In
seeking this distinguished artist from
Mexico to paint its ﬁrst murals,
Dartmouth honored the great New
England tradition; while by his mag-
niﬁcent painting Orozco ha.s honored
that hospitality even as he has made
a precious addition to the tradition
itself.” Mr. Mumford does not con-
cern himself with the rest of the Art
Digest diatribe, with its passionately
blind prejudices and its cheap scur-
rility. I mention this attack here
merely to illustrate the method in
which those nourished by traditions
productive of social chaos and spirit-
ual death cry down any effort to cre-
ate order and vitality.

But the Dartmouth frescoes are
more than an effort; they are a work
of art, and a work highly important

for its sincerity, its depth of analysis,l
and its creativeness no less than for;
its strictly technical excellences off
efilective form and color. In these.
frescoes, which the writer was fortu-
nate to see while they were in prog-
ress as well as in their completed}
form, Orozco has by the effective use:
oif line and color and by his sincerity!
analyzed convincingly the whole pano-l
rama of American society. 
THE TVVO PANELS on the easti

end of the long room in which
the frescoes are to be found furnishi
the setting for the ﬁrst section, which‘;
deals with pre-conquest Mexican civil i
ization. The ﬁrst panel presents the
migrations of peoples in search of;
new lands—peoples whose couragegl
whose need is understood and ex-l
pressed; migrations which were uni-I
versal to all ancient peoples. The sec-'
ond panel, Ancient Human Sacrifices,i
points to the satisfaction of the ideals
of ancient religion and of nationalism_
Here is the framework. VVithin that
framework we see a spirit of cooper-a
a.tion and essential goodness, personi-
ﬁed by the-ancient man-god Quetzal-
coatl, displacing superstitions which
dull man‘s sensibilities. A Golden
Age is achieved, in which agriculture,
sculpture, science show how high a
degree of spiritual vigor the pre-
Columbian civilization reached even
within its limited backgrounds. But
that civilization, as all others. decays

driving out Quetzalcoatl, Quetzal
coatl’s arm, pointing in dramatic
prophecy, carries us across the space
occupied by a library desk to the sec-
ond series of panels, those dealing
with post-conquest civilization.

Here again is the same interrelated
ﬂow of events. The peoples conquered
by the sword-and-cross-bearing Cor-
tez are fed into a machine. Here is
clearly suggested not only the speciﬁc
relation between modern power pro-
duction and the older martial regimen-
tation, but also the cultural unity of
the modern scene. The panel on the
machine is cold, repellent. The ma-
chine has blotted out personalities
and ideas and activities. The specific
situation is analyzed. Anglo America
is cooperatively regimcnted; perhaps
it is almost. too much of a single-thinlv

ing unit; Hispano-America is individ-
ual, protesting against the oppressive
actions of strikingly painted lovers of
war and money; it is individual but

{ not collective enough to build success-

fully. The last of the series on this
wall strikes clearly and cleanly at the
acquirement of knowledge for its own
sake. VVl1ile the world burns, sterile
academicians watch a loose—jointed un-
gainly skeleton give birth to a dead
embryonic college graduate. This
panel cuts deep into all those who
hope for vitality and interestedness
in education. Only through the ef-
forts of these persons, whether they
be educators or students, can educa-
tion face the ﬁre of a burning world
and ﬁght it. The oppressive aspects
of nationalism are strikingly presented
in a panel corresponding in theme as
well as in position with with the
Ancient Human Sacrifice panel at the
east end of the room. Finally, there
is a picture of Jesus aggressive and in-
tense, active in mind and action
against the superstitious and militaris-
tic features of a society which calls
itself Christian. Like the orchestra-
tion of a symphony, throughout all
the panels color is used to build up
an emotional crisis, reached in these
last two panels which are brilliantly
high in color.
AKEN ALONE, the last series of
panels might be said to be dis-
couraging. But the possibility of ef-
fectual creativeness carries over from
the Quetzalcoatl section through'the

_second section and furnishes emotion

sufficient to rebuild the ruins. Fur-
thermore, Orozco has painted conclud-
ing panels. showing buildings in prog-

l

l

ress of construction, and men reading
and conversing in their attempts at
rebuilding.

In his Dartmouth frescoes, then,
Orozco has analyzed with understand-
ing. sympathy, and clarity ancient civ-
ilizations, usiug the 13-re-conquest civ-
ilization as a base. He has pointed
out the interrelatcdness of certain
malevolent cultural organizations of
our day. He has expressed the need
for a. coming-together of the emotions
and ideas of Anglo and Hispo.no-Amer
ica. He has given us hope for a gen-
eral rebuilding. Orozco has used
warm and expressive colors or cold
colors to express his attitude towards
certain subjects; he has used color to
express intensity of emotion. His
lines portray the emotions represen-
ed. The design is effective. It car-
ries on and on from one panel to an-
other; aided by the repetition of col-
ors, it welds the whole fresco into the
unit in which shape Arozco wishes it!
to be considered.

VVords cannot convey completely

the emotions which painting can cre-
ate, This much however, can be said.
No one can look a.t Orozco’s frescoes]
without being affected. There can be;
no passivity about the Dartmouth‘
frescoes. They have the dynamic.
power of changing people’s minds and
opinions. I speak from experience;
they changed mine.

Southern California Up;
Minnesota Men On Deck

It is not at all hard to pardon the keen spirit which is being
built. up around Saturday ’s game with Southern California... On that
day, Panther followers see a golden opportunity to ﬂing right back
into the faces of divers sports scribes those all-too-memorable scores,
To be very precise, it was indeed on
the first day of the new year following the dates given above that
the Trojans administered those lickings to surprised Pitt outﬁts.

Now, once again, there is to be ¢

reckoning. The men of Troy have be-
come our guests and visitors, It is
up to us to treat them in the same
ﬁne manner that they treated us. ‘We
may become righteously enthused
about it all.

The fact that the walls of Troy
have already been crumbled by Wash-
ington State’s huskies brings out two
signiﬁcant points. One, that Southern
California will hit Pitt on the rebound
from a bad day out west and will be
just that much tougher_ The other
point is that beating Southern Califor-
nia isn’t going to do us any great good
when comes the payoff of naming na-
tional champions. For no matter what
happens against the Trojans, Pitt’s
problem lies in taking care of the
Minnesota Gophers. And from a
casual glance at the score of the Min-
nesota-Nebraska game of last Satur-
day we may be pardoned for observ-
ing that such will be quite a problem.
Running over three touchdowns
against the Cornhuskers at this early
date is no mean feat.

Let us then, oil up the war-drums
for the Southern California boys, but‘
let us be sure we can keep them
beating long enough and hard enough
for the men of Minnesota. For beyond
the Southern California Alps lies the
Minnesota Italy and take it from me
those Swedes are tough. .

To players, rooters, coaches and all,
we say: Trounce the Trojans, smear
the Swedes, and then, by all that is
sacred to football, we ought to be in
good enough form to nose out the
Titans of Westminster!

For New Women

Freshmen, Transfers Will Be

Guests In Second Annual
Affair At Heinz House

The ﬁres of the Heinz House hearth
will be kindled for the ﬁrst time this
year tonight at 7:30 o'clock, at the
Hearth ceremony sponsored jointly by
the YWCA and the YWHA. This
ceremony, which was initiated last
year, is symbolic of the purposes of
the two organizations and of the
friendship and cooperation existing
among the women on campus.

All freshman and transfer women
will be welcomed and formally intro-
duced to Heinz House. Because of
the limited seating space, only senior
mentors, women of the faculty, and
men of the faculty who are interested
in either the YWCA or YWHA are in-
vited to witness this traditional cere-
mony. Members of the combined cabi-
nets who are not participating in the
ceremony will serve as ushers.

The pageant, which was written and
is being directed by Miss Thyrsa VV.
Amos, dean of women, is patterned
after an old Roman ceremony. For
this purpose, Heinz House is trans-
formed into the House of A1nicit.ia
whose hearth is festively decorated
in celebration of the lighting of the
hearth ﬁres of friendship. The ushers
