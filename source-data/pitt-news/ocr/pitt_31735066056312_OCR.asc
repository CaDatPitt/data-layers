These words, spoken by

 student government person-

Brody said the retreat was
necessary to familiarize the
new members with the
responsibilities of their
offices.

Fufillo said that the SGA
at Syracuse is a volunteer
organization and that is the
way members are treated.
All events, including SGA
luncheons, are paid out of
their own pockets, she said.

Penn State’s Undergrad-
uate Student Government,
which represents the largest
student body in the state -
39,000 students, does not
hold any retreat at all.
According to President Rob
Kampia, the only “confer-
ence“ activity paid for by
student funds is a trip for
two people to the Big Ten
Conference seminar three
times a year.

“We may send one repre-

tal conference or seminar,”
Kampia said, “but we don’t
have the funds to hold any
retreats for ourselves.”

The Student Admin-
istration at West Virginia
University holds a leader-
ship conference, but does
not find it necessary to
leave campus. _

“We have a retreat in
August before our term
begins,” —said Booth
Goodwin, attorney general
of SA. “We are able to ori-
ent newcomers to proce-
dures and goals in one day.
It’s held in our student
union and we use less than
$500 in Student Activity
funds.” ’

At Ohio State University,
the 20 members of the
Undergraduate Student
Government Cabinet meet
in the fall for one day. This
government body repre-
sents 54,000 students — the

for new Pitt business school

By Stacy Browning
For the Pitt News

Members of the Faculty Assembly
criticized Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor for approving the establish-
ment of an undergraduate business
school.

“I’m surprised of the chancellor’s
action,” assembly member Philip Wion
said.” I’m also appalled by them.”

After Provost Donald Henderson
wrote a letter to O’Connor recom-
mending he move ahead with the Pitt
undergraduate business school,
O’Connor then sent a letter to the
Board of Trustees recommending their
approval of the plan, said assembly
President James C. Holland at
Tuesday’s assembly meeting.

“The provost recommended
approval with the reservation that out-
side funds had to be found to cover
the extensive start-up program,”
Holland said.

Professor Edward Symon said there

needs to be a more extensive ﬁnancial
analysis of the building. He said the
building, operating and staffing costs
still need to be taken into account, as
well as the implications this new
school would have on regional cam-
puses.

“For them to take this action with-
out going through the Planning and
Budgeting system is bad for the uni-
versity and suggests that shared gov-
ernments and collegiality lasts,” Wion
said.

Assembly members also voiced con-
cern over spending $70 million to
expand Hillman Library. The state
approved this proposal and granted
money through Project Jump Start.
The university is matching the State’s
contribution.

Along with the library extension, the
building committees are also under-
way in discussing the plans for a mul-
tipurpose academic center, a new
convocation center and renovations to

St.A.R. seeks new recruits against racism

By Thanita Adams
For The Pitt News

Students Against Racism
(St.A.R.) is now actively
recruiting new members for
this semester.

StA.R., founded in 1990, is
dedicated to countering “bad
racial relations,” a St.A.R. fact
sheet stated.

Joe Babinsack, president of
the group, is enthusiastic
about this year’s activities. He
stressed the fact that St.A.R. is
going to be much more active
than in previous years and

that “this is not the same old
St.A.R.”

While the organization
began mainly as a discussion
group, the emphasis is now
on action. “We are reforming
the group and establishing a
good foundation  We want
to be more visual. We want to
be seen on campus,”
Babinsack said.

“Action speaks louder than
words,” stated the fact sheet,
which reaffirmed Babinsack’s
goals.

. The restructuring of St.A.R.

will mean more residence hall

activities, more forums and
more campus participation.
Planned for the semester are
presentations at local area
high schools and a St.A.R.
questionnaire, which
Babinsack said he hopes will
“force people to think about
their own attitudes on
racism.”

Other possibilities for the
semester, which have been
successful in the past, include
symposiums and guest speak-
ers, the removal of graffiti
around campus and films that
explore the issues of racism.

force was used for purely
moral reasons, said the editors
of the New Republic Magazine.

Croatia. The former Yugoslavia
was torn by war as leaders of
the European Community and
the United States wondered
what to do. Brutal crimes and
ethnic cleansing have conjured
up images not seen since the
likes of World War 11. Despite
economic sanctions, it is safe
to say that there is, for the
moment, no end in sight.

Recession constipates tbe world

While the American media
screamed about the dire eco-
nomic circumstances of this
country, it was felt by the
whole world. Recession spread
to geo-economic powerhouses
like Japan and Germany.
Japan’s stock market fell 26

percent and high interest rates
in Germany, as a result of
reuniﬁcation, caused turmoil in
the European monetary system.

Arab/Israeli Peace Tal/es

For the first time in a long
time there was a dim light in
the troubled Middle East. The
Arabs and Israelis engaged in
peace talks, which have
proved to be largely symbolic.
Syria demanded the Golan
Heights while Israel offered
only a partial compromise. The
election of Yitzhak Rabin saw a
change in policy toward the
treatment of the Palestinians as
Israel offered restricted self-
government for the displaced

peoples.

Europe completes tbe internal
mar/eet

In 1985, Lord Cockfield of
Britain introduced his White
Paper explaining the 285 direc-
tives necessary to complete
Europe’s internal market. In
December of 1992 the comple-
tion of the market was intro-
duced and most barriers to
trade were removed. Europe’s
540 citizens are now a part of
the world’s largest single mar-
ket, with a Gross National
Product which exceeds Japan
and equals the United States.

Earth Summit in Rio defaneiro

In an attempt to solve press-
ing environmental problems,
the world joined together in a
summit attended by the most
heads of state ever. Viewed
with mixed feelings by those
on both sides of the political
spectrum, treaties on global
warming and bio-diversity
were signed. The United States
was ridiculed by environmental
activists and other nations for
gutting the treaty. The presi-
dent claimed that jobs were the
issue.

The North American Free Trade
Association

Canada, Mexico and the
United States signed a treaty
allowing free trade between
the three countries. The NAFTA
treaty will eliminate tariff barri-
ers between the three countries
but will allow them to maintain
separate tariffs against third-
party countries. Proponents
argue that it will increase the
economic welfare of the coun-
tries involved, while opponents
in Canada and the United
States say that it will cost jobs.

The Royal Family
Scandals ripped through the
British tabloids and

Buckingham Palace as 1992
was the worst year in the histo-
ry of the royals. Princess Diane
and Prince Charles separated
after 12 year of marriage.
Princess Sarah Ferguson and
Prince Andrew separated after
only two years of marriage. To

Students serving on stu-

Assembly

Continued from page I
Bellefield Annex, Holland said.

Each committee will be hold-
ing open forums later in
January so people will be able
to voice opinions on the use of
these buildings.

Other issues addressed at the
assembly meeting include:
-Approval of proposed amend-
ments of guidelines for the per-
formance review of academic
administrators including deans,
regional campus presidents and
heads’ of other academic
responsibility centers.
-Holland read the Hearing
Board’s results on the charges
brought before Professor
Herbert L. Needleman. The
board found no evidence of
fabrication or falsification of
data, procedure or analysis of
Needleman’s research that
would bias the results in
favor of finding the harmful

effect that lead had on the neu-
ropsychological development
of small children.

Needleman expressed his
concern to the assembly about
the expense of his legal
fees as well as not being heard
by the university.
-Chairperson for the Health
Sciences Committee, Julius S.
Younger, went over his report
on the post of senior vice chan-
cellor of Health Administration
and the method by which the
post was filled; the relationship
of the senior vice chancel-
lor of Health Administration to
the senior vice chancellor for
Health Sciences; and the rela-
tion of the University of

The assembly members dis-

For Brody it's strike two

It’s the bottom of the ninth, nobody on and
President Jacob Brody is at the plate. The cheers of
his fans suddenly change to jeers, as the pitch is
delivered. It’s a $5,000 fastball, and with a mighty
swing of the bat Brody misses. “Stiiiiii-rike one,”
they scream from the bleachers.

“Strike two is coming,” scream a few voices from
the background. No sooner is it said than done.
Once again Brody has swung hard and missed. For
the sake of our team we hope he can recover. But if
he can’t we hope some leadership will come from
somewhere.

Monday evening, at the first Student Government
Board meeting of the year, President Jacob Brody
nominated newly-elected board member Ted
Schroeder, president pro tempore.

This job is important because when the president
is absent from a meeting the pro tempore assumes
the president’s responsibilities.

According to SGB’s constitution, any member of
the eight-member board can assume this position.
However, traditionally the position has been grant-
ed to the member with the highest number of votes.
This was Jacob Brody in 1992 and Gil Golden in
1991. It should be Brian Bolton in 1995, he received
1,044 votes this year compared to Schroeder’s 996.

The reasons for appointing the member with the
highest vote count is obvious. For one thing, that
person is the choice of the constituents. In any case
— whether in the absence of the president or not
— this is who the people want as their leader.

Secondly, if for any reason (say just for an exam-
ple impeachment) the president cannot fulfill his or
her duties, then the SGB member who received the
highest number of votes finishes out theterm. Since
president pro tempore enables an individual to
establish key leadership skills, it is only logical this
position should be awarded to the highest vote—get-
ter.

Aside from the pragmatic reasons, Schroeder’s
appointment raises some important ethical ques-
tions. Not only is Schroeder a fraternity brother of
Brody, but he is also the president’s ‘big brother.
Seeing how the last two pro temps were elected
president, one must wonder what Brody based his
decision on.

While Brody is the primary one to blame, he
shouldn’t accept all of the heat. The SGB members
who voted in favor of this decision are also at fault.

Perhaps it may seem that we’re being a little
rough on President Brody. First the “$5,000 ques-
tion,” and now this. Through it all, though, we real-
ize that everybody makes mistakes. Even us. After
all, we did endorse him for president.

Call a cop, We've been robbed

Something smells in Oakland.
And for once it is not the bath-
room in Zelda’s.

I am, of course, referring to the
extravagant $10,000 retreat taken
last weekend to a mountain

resort by the Student
Government Board.VAnd I am
outraged.

To be fair, the newly-elected
SGB had no say in where it
would go for the retreat and are
not to blame. In fact, many of
them share my anger. The blame
for this act of betrayal of the stu-
dents’ trust and outright robbery
of the students’ money falls upon
the shoulders of the board’s pres-
ident, Jacob Brody.

His arrogance and total disre-
spect ’ for the Allocation
Committee’s repeated requests
for planning a more economical
retreat translate into a disrespect
for the students that he is sup-
posed to be representing. Every
other student group has no
choice but to adhere to alloca-
tions’ decisions regarding their
requests for funds. Brody, on the
other hand, ignored the commit-
tee’s request and the general
opinion of many on last year’s
board, including former president
Gil Golden.

Brody decided to go to
Nemacolin anyway and in effect
has stolen $5,000 from the
Student Activities fee —- a fee

- that all of us pay into but few get.

concrete beneﬁts from. Especially
such benefits like steak and lob-
ster dinners, two-story, two-bed-
room condominiums with king
size beds, washers and dryers
(what would they need those
for?) and a housekeeping service
that picks up after you in your
room and folds your dirty
clothes. 0

Brody’s actions have destroyed
the credibility of the SGB mem-
bers and more specifically
Allocations Committee Chair Lisa
Waslo. Her committee must
decline requests from other orga-
nizations for money totalling
much less than $5,000 because
the committee is trying to be fair

a.o...«._..-nu-wueaacuur v

and to stay within their budget.
What was Brody thinking about
when he asked for an emergency
allocation of double what the
SGB retreat was originally allocat-
ed? How could he possibly
assume that the request would
be approved with no discussion?
Brody was elected on the basis

 

Lakely

that he would be looking out for
the best interests of Pitt’s 15,000
undergraduate population. With
this act, it is clear that Brody was
only looking out for his own best
interests.

As could be expected, the
excuses are coming in droves.
Ted Schroeder, newly-appointed
SGB president pro tempore, said
in an interview with Chad

Devinney on WPTS yesterday .

that when the second denial
failed to reach Brody “Student
Activities stepped in and said the
retreat would go forward where
it was at. No one really had a
chance to make the change.”
That is completely false. Brody
has always had the power to
either stop the trip or postpone
the trip until the board could
reach agreement on the location
and prices.

_ And just to remind us all that
we indeed elected politicians to
the SGB, Schroeder said, “I really
hope that we won’t be judged
too harshly on this, especially
Jacob  I think it is a mistake
that we’ve all acknowledged. At
this point it’s not important
where we should lay the blame.”
He added that the SGB will learn

--a.p..»...-4--o.-1..-.

...~-.1 u--v.---.-.n.~a-'-i-. ....,.,._

from this experience and prevent
it from happening again. 
This is classic political weasel-
talk if I ever heard it. Brody and
the members of the Student
Activities office,‘ who were
responsible for planning the trip,
just used extremely poor judge-
ment and wasted student monies.
When the fair allocation of our
money is your prime responsibili-
ty, how else are you to be

‘ judged’

Beyond the outrageous price
tag on the trip, there is the fur-
ther question as to whether a
retreat was necessary at all. The
54,000 students of Ohio State, the
largest university in the U.S.,
seem to survive just fine without
their student. government going
on a retreat. Penn State’s build-
ings aren’t crumbling to the
ground because its student gov-

V ernment doesn’t go on retreats

and its student population is sig-
nificantly higher than ours. But
our wise and considerate presi-
dent deﬁnitely thinks it is neces-
sary. In fact, he feels it is essen-
tial.

“I never assumed that we
wouldn’t be going on a retreat,”
Brody said. “The trip is necessary
for the workings of the board. If
it doesn’t happen, the board does
not work.” Brody further
explained that the trip couldn’t
even be postponed when it was
clear that the approval of the trip
would not be voted on. “We
would lose too much time,” he
said. “We would be trying to do
things with members who don’t
know how to or what to do.”

Well, I hope the board got our.

money’s worth and now know
exactly what to do. I hope the
steak and lobster filled your
stomachs and the discussions
filled your minds. ,Because for
the money, we will expect a lot
from you. And Jake, if you feel
another retreat is necessary, my
apartment is available for rent for
the low price of $5,000. Snacks
included.

Eric Mobley, shown here against Miami, slammed his way to 14 points last night against UConn.

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

His final statline seemed as harmless and
reserved as his on—court demeanor —— four
points and nine rebounds in 29 minutes of

action.

But to the 15th-ranked Connecticut Huskies,
Pitt forward Antoine Jones’ last stand in the rau-
cous Hartford Civic Center bellowed with the
power of a symphony orchestra — a one-man
ensemble that echoed the sweet sounds of a

Panthers’ victory.

Jones’ soaring rebound and layup over

Huskies’ star Scott Burrell as time expired vault-
ed the Pitt basketball team to a dramatic 80—78
victory over UConn last night, silencing 16,294
roaring Husky faithfuls, as well as an untold
number of college basketball critics who said
they couldn’t win a big road game.

Thirty—six seconds after UConn guard Brian
Fair’s three-pointer tied the game at 78, Jones
out-jumped the preseason All-American forward
Burrell, converted a missed shot by Pitt forward
Chris McNeal and like an emergency brake on a
careening 18—wheeler, abruptly stopped a furi-
ous, uptempo Big East battle — and recharged

Penguin superstar Mario
Lemieux was diagnosed
with a lesser form of
Hodgkin’s disease, a form
of cancer, according to an
Associated Press report.

Doctors removed an
enlarged lymph node
from Lemieux’s neck, and
the report said that the
disease is only in the
node.

Lemieux will undergo
radiation treatments for
the next month. Team
officials said he will be
out of the lineup for four
to six weeks.

This news comes in the

middle of what had been
a season of relative health
for Lemieux, who missed
the team’s last three
games due to his chronic
back problems. Until that
time, he had been making
21 run at Wayne Gretzky’s
NHL record of 215 points
in a single season by scor-
ing 104 points (39 goals,
65 assists) in 40 games.

Success breeds expecta-
tions.

But Pitt wrestling head
coach Rande Stottlemyer
wouldn’t have it any other
way. After guiding the
Panthers to a Top 20 finish
last season in both dual
meet and tournament rank-
ings and sending four
wrestlers to the NCAA
Tournament in Oklahoma
City, Stottlemyer faces the
challenge of keeping his
program at that prestigious
level.

Losing All—American stal-
warts Scott Hovan and
Perry Miller to graduation
does not make the task
any easier. However, last
year’s recruiting class was
considered among the best
in the nation, and
Stottlemyer now looks to
that blossoming young tal-

-ent as the foundation of

Pitt’s program over the
next three or four seasons.

That stellar recruiting
class included heavyweight
Pat Wiltanger, J.J Fasnacht
(134), John Richey (126),
Joe Plouse (158), Greg
Budman (142), and Shawn
Kennedy (167-77) — all of
whom will contribute in
varying capacities this
year.

Stottlemyer’s Panthers
always face a brutal sched-
ule, and 1993 will be no
exception. The Panthers
are facing another difficult
task this weekend with
Clemson coming to
Fitzgerald Field House
Friday and Pitt traveling to
Lock Haven for its Eastern
Wrestling League opener
Saturday. The EWL current-
ly boasts four nationally-
ranked teams, including
Lock Haven.

Pitt gymnasts vault into season after injury-plagued '92

By Todd S. Rimer
For the Pitt News

1992 was a year in which the women’s
gymnastics team was expecting to have a
successful season.

It had four established seniors with a
strong supporting cast. Unfortunately, the
hope of a winning season was tarnished
with a multitude of injuries. In fact, only
Kristen Brown competed in every event
in each meet. The Panthers finished the
season with a record of 7-10, leaving
strong individual performances as the
highlights.

Head coach Debbie Yohman said she
expects her young ‘93 squad to bounce
back from the setbacks of last year.

The Lady Panthers are led by co—cap-
tains Brown and Alisha Friend. Brown is a
seniortwho was voted the team’s MVP for
the 1991-1992 season. But her results over
the years show that she is a perennial top
performer and has always shown leader-

0 ship skills.

Last year Brown qualified for NCAA
Northeast Regional competition, was the
top all—around competitor as a first—year
student and she has made the top ten list
a total of 10 times.

“[\X7ith her] being our number one all-

arounder and with her experience, I look
to Kristin to be a key leader,” Yohman
said.

Her leadership may be more necessary
this year than any year in the past
because the team is so young. It would
be hard to imagine Brown getting any
better, but Yohman stressed the impor-
tance of Brown being healthy and as long
as her wrist heals properly and complete-

ily she may have the best season of her

already all-star career.

According to Yohman, Friend “is neck
and neck with Brown in competing for
the position of number one all-arounder.”

Despite missing half of the 1992 season
with tonsillitis and though only a sopho-
more, Friend made a big enough impres-
sion on her teammates and coaches that
she was named the Panthers’ co-captain
for this season.

“Her beam is improving at a fast pace,
and she can probably do a vault in her
sleep,” Yohman said.

If Friend continues to rebound from
back problems suffered in the fall semes-
ter and remains healthy, she has the capa-
bilities to put up some highly-competitive
scores.

Karen jorgensen is the only senior on

the team other than Brown. Jorgensen

was named to the ECAC All-Conference
Team for her performance during the
1990 season. In the same year, she was
given the honor of ECAC Gymnast of the
Week and tied for second in the ﬂoor
exercise at the ECAC championships.

Jorgensen has been a consistent per-
former year in, year out.

“Karen is someone we have always
depended on because she gets the job
done,” Yohman said.

The bad news for Yohman and the
team is that Jorgensen will not be an all-
arounder. She will not be able to perform
on the uneven parallel bars because of an
elbow injury she suffered last season. .

Three sophomores other than Friend
are Shannon Brown, Michaelene “Mikie”
Myers and Heather Halovanic.

Brown was not able to compete all last
season because she was sidelined with a
knee injury.

“Shannon’s status has greatly improved,
and she will be able to compete on the
uneven parallel bars in the first meet,”
Yohman said.

Brown does well on the vault and is
competitive on the ﬂoor and‘ beam, but
her consideration for all-around depends
on how well the healing of her knee pro-
gresses.

Myers is another highly-talented gym-
nast who has been limited in practice due
to a back injury. If her back continues to
strengthen and she remains healthy, she
will be able to demonstrate the skills that
made her a former elite gymnast.

“Myers is being evaluated on a day-to-
day basis,” Yohman. said. ‘‘[For now} she
will perform bar, and if her back permits
her to tumble then she’1l compete on
beam. She has the potential to be one of
our best all—arounders.”

Halovanic performed as an all-arounder
during the second half of last season
despite a nagging ankle injury. According
to Yohman, her ankle did not heal as well
and as quickly as expected, and she will
be out indefinitely. Yohman said she may
be out for the year.

Yet another victim of injury, last year

and this season, is junior Margaret “Meg” “

Johns. Early last year Johns injured one of
her ankles, and as it was healing her
other ankle was injured, sidelining her for
much of the season. Johns did manage to
compete on bars twice.

Now she is suffering from back prob-
lems. Yohman said, “Meg has been doing
some heavy conditioning. Yohman added
that she might be able to compete in two

Nebraska Open on Saturday.

Until Stott1emyer’s young
guns kick it into high gear,
Pitt will fall back on its big
three, seniors Sean Gibbs and
Steve Budman and junior Jeff
Kloiber.

“Our biggest guns are
gonna be our two returning
NCAA qualifiers,” Stottlemyer
said. That would be Gibbs
and Kloiber, both of whom
appear capable of monster
seasons. Gibbs (167) won 25
matches a year ago, en route
to a second-place finish at the
EWL Tournament.

“lGibbsl did a great job last
year; he had a tremendous
year,” Stottlemyer said. “We’re
expecting him to be a big
leader for us.”

Kloiber (190) started slowly
this season, missing signifi-

cant tournament action while
recovering from September
knee surgery. His sophomore
performance was up and
down. But when Kloiber is
on, he can beat just about
anyone.

“He really didn’t come
around until halfway through
the season,” Stottlemyer said.
“We expect him to be a go-to
guy. He’s gotta be what Perry
and Hovan were last year,
and he and Gibbs and Steve
have to be that now.” ,

Budman (150) ended last
year on somewhat of a disap-
pointing note, hampered _by
injuries most of the year and
suffering a concussion in the
opening round of the EWL

Tournament. Motivation is

strong for the steady senior.

expect that.”

Every other wrestler in the
current Panther lineup owns
one year or less of collegiate
wrestling experience. In addi-
tion, Stottlemyer said true
first-year wrestlers Brett
Gould (142) and John
Gibeaut (167) could con-
tribute immediately.

“As a coach you’re really
fearful. We’re gonna take our
lumps early,” Stottlemyer
said. “The most important
thing is that they improve —
and this crew has a lot of
potential. There’s a lot of
room for improvement

because this is a very talented
group.”

Encouraging glimpses of
that lofty talent have already
surfaced, as evidenced by last
weekend's gritty perfor-
mances.

The lower weight classes
often turned frustrating for
Pitt last season, but the talent
is in place for a drastic turn-
around.

Redshirt sophomore Mike
Moore (118) has returned
after sitting out last season
with a dislocated finger and
made his presence felt with
an impressive run during
tournament action and a pin
4:16 into his bout against
Lehigh. A

Richey, a gifted redshirt
freshman, steps into the 126
slot. Stottlemyer is hoping
sophomore Fasnacht will step

up following a rookie season
in which he wrestled incon-
sistently and sometimes
lethargically.

“J.J. had a tough year last
year, but I hope he can learn
from that,” Stottlemyer said.

Fasnacht showed maturity
and determination in a pivotal
3-2 decision against Lehigh.
That match was perhaps the
key point of the entire meet
and proved Fasnacht could be
a big-time contributor this
season.

The latter weights should
be kind to Pitt again.
Stepping into the large shoes
of Miller, Wiltanger brings
enormous potential to the
heavyweight class and the
invaluable experience of
dueling with Miller many
times in practice.

to three weeks.

“lWhen johns is completely
healthy] she has the potential to
be one of our all-arounders
because she is such a hard
worker with a lot of talent,“
Yohman said.

The remainder of the team
consists of a talented, hard—work—
ing group of first—year students
— Christine Battista, Deena
Daller, Tracy McKenna, Jennifer
Pfetzing, Brenda Stevens and
Bethany Toellner.

Battista is a walk—on to the
team this season

“Her number-one event is the
vault,” Yohman said. “We need
her to come through for us on
this event.”

Battista came to Pitt as the
1992 Pennsylvania State Champ
in the floor exercise and on bars.

“Christine is a good dancer
and performs difficult routines.
When she becomes a better tum-
bler and builds her confidence,
she will be a competitor for the
all—around,” Yohman said.

“Deena lDallerl has come a
long way in a short period of
time, in gymnastics and in the
transition from high school to
college,” said Yohman.

Vault and ﬂoor are her present
strengths, but the all-around
might be right around the cor-
ner.

McKenna is a hard worker

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, January 13, 1993

with a lot of leg strength. /

“Tracy possesses a tremendous
amount of talent.” Yohman said.
“Tracy is going to be great on
bars, a strong competitor.

"She may become one of the
team’s strongest all-arounders.”

Pfetzing, like Battista, is anoth-
er walk—on to the Panthers’
squad.

Pfetzing has talent on all
events but Yohman said that her
strength is her vaulting.

Stevens is one of the best
of this first—year class.

In December, she injured her
ankle and that has kept her from
tumbling.

“Brenda’s bar and beam are
perfect, and she will perform
excellent on floor and on vault if
her ankle allows her,” Yohman
said.

Yohman said that Stevens will
compete for the all-around once
her ankle does heal and she is
able to improve on her tumbling.

Toellner has been limited by a
back injury suffered last semes-
ter.

Due to her lack of practice
time Yohman said, “She may
have difficulty in her first meet,
but over time her performance
will improve greatly, allowing
her to reach her level of poten-

. tial.”

“She may end up being an all-
arounder going into the first
meet,” Yohman said.

Kristin Brown was the MVP of the Pitt gymnastics team last season.

Yohman expressed concern
about the Lady Panthers’ first
meet this Friday at the University
of Michigan.

“We are not completely ready
for this meet,” Yohman said.
“We are leaving out some skills
and ‘watering down a lot of rou-
tines.”

This is because many of the
injuries from last year and last
semester have caused setbacks
in preparation.

“The team must realize they
are going to make mistakes and
the first meet may not go as well
as first meets usually do,”
Yohman said. “I expect a great

Continued from page 9
the Panthers’ hopes of a chal-
lenging for the Big East title.

“This is one helluva win for
us,” Evans said, “especially on
the road — considering all the
trouble we have had. With
Connecticut playing so well
and the great crowd here, we
were very fortunate to get out
of here with a win.”

Even more fortunate for
Evans and company was the
fact that his buzzer-beating
hero even played the game.
Jones missed practiced the past
two days with a strained
Achilles tendon, and his status
was unknown until pregame
warmups. But when the game
started, Jones was there. And
when the game was on the
line, Jones was there.

For Jones, a 6-foot-7-inch
senior from Baltimore, his last-
second putback was his finest
moment as a Panther.

“Definitely the biggest
[rebound] of my career,” Jones
said. “I didn’t think I played as
well as I could  but we got
the win. That’s the important
thing.”

While Jones’ offensive num-
bers on the night were under
his season average of 12.4
points per game, his contribu-
tions to Pitt’s biggest win of
the year go far beyond his final
basket.

As Pitt’s best man-to-man
defensive player, Jones drew
the assignment of shadowing
the man he scored his winning
over — Burrell.
Guarding arguably the best
athlete in the Big East —
Burrell came into the game
averaging 17.7 ppg —— Jones
quieted the 6’6” senior, limiting
him to just 13 points on four-
of-13 shooting and five
rebounds.

“I was just trying to lay a
body on him  because he

roams and goes to the board
hard. Coach [Evans] told me
[before the game] that I
wouldn't get too much help on
[guarding] him -— that I had to
really concentrate on him —
and I tried to do so.”

“I think I did a pretty good
job.”

“I thought the defense was
pretty good tonight,” Evans
said minutes after the buzzer-
beater win. “We did a pretty
good job on their superstars —
Donyell Marshall and [Scott]
Burrell. They both struggled to
get their points  that may
have gotten them out of sync
mentally.”

Pitt (10-3, 3-3 in the Big East)
did a pretty good job staying in
the ballgame early on, trailing
39-38 at halftime despite suffer-
ing from a recurring bout of
turnoveritis —— 13 in the first 20
minutes.

When Pitt wasn’t being chari-
table with the basketball, the
team was downright produc-
tive — getting strong half—court
and full—court offense from the
corporate trio of Chris McNeal,
Eric Mobley and Jerry
McCullough.

For the game, McCullough‘

and McNeal led the Panthers
with 19 — Big Daddy coming
on an array of mid-range
jumpers, Ice’s by way of three-
pointers and foul shots.
Mobley did his usual dunkfest
— slamming his way to 14
points while grabbing 11
boards.

UConn (7-3, 2-2) was led by
Fair’s 19 points. Donny
Marshall added 15.

Pitt’s next game is a matchup
with the best of the Big East —
Seton Hall. The Pirates visit the
Field House this Saturday for
an 8 p.m. date with the‘Field
House Fanatics, Panther Paul
and 6,798 faithful ready to rock
the rafters.

“He’s still a freshman. He’s lacking a lot
of experience. But he’s got a. lot of talent,"
Stottlemyer said. “He’s got a great work
ethic. But it’s a different situation this year
because the pressure is on, and that does
funny things to some people. But if any-
body can handle it, it’s Pat Wiltanger.

“I’m sure there’s gonna be times where
he stubs his toe, but there’s gonna be times
where he’s gonna be a hero too.”

So far Wiltanger’s been the hero. With
the outcome of the Lehigh meet riding in
the balance, Wiltanger stepped up with a
resounding 7-0 decision.

Now that perennial EWL king Penn State
has departed for the Big ‘Ten, the league
race should be wide open. Stottlemyer
feels that any team is capable of winning it.
Foremost among those teams is Lock
Haven.

“They had a young team last year and
came on real strong at the end. They have
a lot of kids back,” Stottlemyer said. “...
Every group is a lot like us — a mixture of
youth and veterans. We have more youth
but we have quite a bit of talent.”

Stottlemyer is a coach who has been
around a while and knows all too well the
value of experience.

sive tackle Jerome Brown
was killed, along with his
12-year-old nephew Gus, in
a tragic automobile accident
June 25 in Brooksville,
Florida.

In a year that starkly
reminded us all of athletes’
mortality, this was the most
shaking example of all.

Brown, the loveable
and fun-loving heart and
soul of a close-knit Eagle
club, died when his black
Corvette skidded off a

rain-slick road in his home-
town.

Ironically, it was just
last season that Brown’s
enormous gifts both on
and off the field had begun
to reach total fruition, with
his children’s football
camps in their inaugural
summer.

7. Ashes

After finding out that it
would be revealed anyway,
former tennis star Arthur
Ashe disclosed on April 8
that he has AIDS and has

known he was HIV positive
since 1988.

He was later named
Sportsman of the Year by
Sports Illustrated.

send the Braves to the

World Series.
9. Jordan Rules
Michael Jordan racked up
the honors again in ‘92. He
won a gold medal as a mem-
ber of the “Dream Team”
and was named NBA MVP as
he led the Chicago Bulls to
an NBA title.
10. Bon Voyage Barkley
Seven-time All—Star for-
ward Charles Barkley was
traded from the Philadelphia
76ers to the Phoenix Suns
for guard Jeff Hornacek,
forward Tim Perry and cen-

ter Andrew Lang.

A superstar of Barkley’s
magnitude getting traded has
become a rarity in sports,
but this deal ended the
tumultuous relationship
between Barkley and Sixers’
owner Harold Katz while
giving the dynamic Sir
Charles a tremendous oppor-
tunity for new life and an
NBA Championship in
Phoenix.
