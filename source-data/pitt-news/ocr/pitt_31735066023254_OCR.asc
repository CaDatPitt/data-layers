In 1972 an -overwhelming major-
ity of mail referendum votes
created the Graduate Professional
Student Association (GPSA); The
vote was practically eight to one in
favor of forming the organization.

The Office of Student Affairs,_

under the‘direction of Dr. Alfred
Moye, dean for student‘ affairs at
time, began work with
interested graduate and profes-
sional students to organize the
GPSA. '

Pitt granted official recognition
to—G_PSA'on January 23, 1973; and

urged graduate and professional

students to utilize the organization

to express their concerns on such ,

matters as inadequate housing,
health insurance,’ job banks and
income tax regulations.

“The GPSA is primarily a service
organization concerned with im-
proving the life of graduate

9+ professional students in. the com-

 

 graduate status,”
" Hughes, chairman of GPSA. Both

munity,” said Gerry Musinsky,
administrative assistant of GPSA.

“We have serviced ‘over 2000
students in the past ﬁve months.”

Presently the association pro-

- vides K general information concern-
ing job opportunities, counseling

and housing. They operate Xerox

and binding services for graduate

dissertations, and they act as

mediator between graduate stu-

dent. organizations, Musinsky said.

“We would like to see more
employment and improve on
said Lamont

Hughes and Musinsky emphasized
that GPSA is in advocacy of the
I‘ students--‘that is,,: a representative

of the students to provide. ‘them,/.

Currently the GPSA is working

on the Interdisciplinary Resource

Chancellor Comments on Funding 

Although Governor Richard
'I'hornburgh’s proposed budget for
ﬁscal year 1981 allocates a small
budget increase for Pitt, the
university actually needs in state
funding, according to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. -

“While the increase is modest,
we are gratiﬁed that in a year in
which the commonwealth faces
continued financial constraints,
Governor Thornburgh has given
high priority to higher education,
and has been responsive to our
request for equity in the allocation’
of available funds,” Posvar said in
a press release to the university’s

ever, falls far short of the increase
necessary to’ sustain academic
programs and to meet financial

needs in the coming year as we

attempt to cope with inﬂation and
‘to hold dowfn tuition charges,” he
added. '

In his proposed budget, Thorn-
burgh recommended that Pitt
receive $71 million, an increase of
$3.5 million over the 1980
appropriation.

Included in the budget proposal
was a $62.9 million appropriation
for educational and general pur-

. poses, a six percent -increase over
’ last year’; appropriation. . Thorn-_

i-Nevv Telephone System Reduces LongDistanice Calls   '

J

p By MIKE DEMORATZ

=_ Southern Paciﬁc Communica-

— tions, a subsidiary of the Southern

Paciﬁc Railroad, recently took
advantage of revolutionary changes
in the federal telecommunications
policies. The company has
announced it is making available to
consumers low-cost telephone ser-
vice that can reduce long distance

costs by 25 to ‘more than 

percent. -. ‘

This new inﬂation-fighting ‘V ser-
vice, a variation of the SPC Spring
V business service now being
enjoyed by more than 35,000
businesses throughnout the U.S.,
is called Sprint LTD. Designed to
meet the needs of individuals
during the periods most often used
for personal calling, Spring‘ LTD is
now available to the general public
in ‘70 metropolitan areas nation-
wide (see map).

V _ According to Dennis McCue,

account representative for South-
ern Paciﬁc, Spring LTD service is
available from S p.m. to 8 a.m.

daily and all day Saturday, Sunday

and legal holidays.

The rates for the service are as
follows: There is a $10 per month
charge for the special code used to
gain access to the service. Then,
there is an eight-to 12-cent
cost-per-minute charge. The rates

. for the service are lower than those

of the phone company if one makes
at least 90 minutes of long distance
calls ‘per month, said McCue.

Sprint LTD allows an ordinary
push-tone phone to be used without
any new wiring or installation of
equipment.

Users merely dial a special

   
   
    

phone number to gain access to the .

Sprint network and their conﬁden-

tial authorizatign code and number ~

in the ordinary fashion, according
to McCue.

The use of the Spring LTD

 

I

service does not in any way

interfere with normal telephone
service. . Students in the dorms
could also take advantage of’this
system just by buying a converter

FAIRMONT, W. VA.——With a
furious squeal of tires and the bark
of hissiren, patrolman Paul Pyles
has raced to the scene of crimes
and accidents-only to be anxiously
asked when the police will arrive.

Pyles has a robust sense of
humor and a strong, easy laugh,
which is just as well, since he

I spends his workingdaysbehind the

wheel of what must be one of the
few Honda Civic patrol cars

/"~ 
"§ around.

-“People are always asking ‘Do
you have a magnet you throw out
front when you’re chasing some-
one?”’ said Pyles, who traded in

his motorcycle for the Honda and a
lot of teasing as part of an
efficiency drive.

“It’s cleaner on the uniforms and
easier on thedry cleaning bills,”
Pyles laughed. “But getting
prisoners or suspects in the back is
something else.”

The midget patrol car has
presented problems when Pyles
has tried to get up to four suspects
into the vehicle for questioning.
Figuring out how to get everbody in
takes a while and even then its
“elbow-to-elbow,” Pyles says.

The car, painted a metallic blue,
has all the normal equipment of
more conventional police cruisers,

from the tiny blue light on the roof
to the shiny gold police badge that
barely ﬁts on the side.

But stopping wayward mortorists
or suspicious characters on the
streets of this northern West
Virginia city can often be as trying
for Pyles as the protesting drivers
he pulls over to the side of the
road——or tries to.

“They always say ‘I didn’t know

you were a policeman,’ or they ask,
me

if I’m from the water
department or something,” he
said. “They look at the car and ask
‘What is that?”’

/—

Pyles’s colleagues, who gleefully
shoot past him in their hulking
cruisers, delight in teasing him, he
ruefully "admits,

“They say thingsilike ‘Get your
lollipops and go take care of the
crossing guards,”’ he said.

Pyles spends most of his day
supervising Fairmont schools and
the city’s traffic crossing guards.
But he’s on‘ call like any patrolman
and routinely handles emergency

-calls and. traffic accidents.

He just wishes people would
believe their eyes when he arrives

in response to _their calls for help.
“They want to know where I work.

They want to know what depart- ~

ment I work with,” Pyles said.

Not that Pyles isn't fond of his
patrol’ car, which he takes home
with him every day and lovingly
tends to.

“I wax it and wash it and look
after it. . .I’m the only driver. Ijust
like having my own car,” he said.

‘But off duty, Patrolman Pyles
drives a large van.

“I like the change,” he conﬁded.

  Carter Appoiniees Among Campaign Contributors

WASHIN_GTON—President
Carter’s re-election campaign is
getting thousands of dollars in
contributions from government
officials who owe their jobs to
him including his ambassadors to
France, Russia, Australia, Sweden,
Norway, and Panama.

-Reports on file at the Federal
Election Commission show that
through last Dec. 31, Carter’s
campaign received $91,365 from
159 ofﬁcials in high-level jobs
or members of the families.

Among the contributors are
Carter himself, giving $1,000, and
his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who
gave $1,000 and listed her
profession as “homemaker.”

Thirty-two members of the
White House staff are listed as
contributors as are all members of

the Cabinet except the secretaries
of state, agriculture, commerce and
education. Attorney General
Benjamin Civiletti and his wife,
Gail, both are $1,000 contributors.

Among ambassadors, Herbert
Salzman, Carter’s envoy to Paris,
gave $1,000 and so did his wife and
their son, Jeffrey, a Stanford
University student.

Other ambassadors who con-
tributed are Rodney Kennedy-
Minnott, Sweden; Lewis A. Lerner,
Norway; Ambler H. Moss Jr.,
Panama; Thomas J . Watson, the
Soviet Union; and Philip H. Alston
Jtj., Australia. Each gave $1,000,
the maximum permitted by law.

Alston, an Atlanta -lawyer,
helped raise thousands of dollars
for Carter in his two‘ campaigns for
governor of Georgia and he and his

family contributed $10,000 to those
campaigns.

As a candidate in 1976, Carter
castigated the practice of appoint-
ing ambassadors on grounds other
than merit. He recalled the
“sickening experience” of visiting
foreign countries and ﬁnding “fat,
bloated, rich incompetents sitting
there as ambassadors for making
political contributions. ”

It is customary for a president’s
appointees to chip in at election
time- Gifts from office holders
violate neither the spirit nor the
letter of the law, but they show one
of the advantages of incumbency.

Carter’s gifts from appointees
constitute only a small fraction of
the $3.9 million the Carter
campaign received by the end of
1979.

The Federal Election Campaign
Act requires contributions of more
than $100 to be reported by name
and occupation. Some ad-
ministration ﬁgures used general
terms to describe their positions.

For example, Treasury Secretary
G. William Miller, who gave
$1,000, is listed merely as “G. W.
Miller,” a 9 ‘federal iofﬁcial.” Sec-
retary of Housing Moon Iandrieu,
who have $500, is listed as a
“government employee.’ ’

From outside the administration,
contributors to the Carter cam-
paign included Adm. Hyman
Rickover, Carter’s former Navy
mentor, and Mrs. Rickover, $1,000
each; Dean Rusk, former secretary
of state, and his wife, $500 each;
Democratic National Chairman
John C. ,White, $1,000; Robert

Strauss, Carter’s campaign man-
ager, and his wife, $1,000 each‘;
South Carolina Gov. Richard Riley,
$300, and his wife, $250; and Mrs.
John Rockefeller III, $1,000.

resident hall policies. Suggestions like this one A
shows ignorance of the issues and a lack of
realistic reasoning. ’

Perhaps now is the time to step back and take a
long look at what,has transpired over the last two
weeks. ' ~

The network news team used the story as a
kicker. That is, the story was run in a humorous
light rather than depicting the seriousness and
concern of students at Pitt. The story did little for
the IRB in terms of presenting its case to the coun-

ry.

The first observation that can be made is that
the Inter Residence Board of the Resident Student
AsssOciation_ has learned the value of
organization. In just a short time period, those
students have organized their forces, evolving
from a disorganizedigroup of voices into‘ a solid
- ' . organized opposition to the proposed policy.

I

The administration should learn a lesson from“
their“actions concerning the‘ proposed ' visitation
policy revisions. When it comes to policy changes
that will directly effect students, proper student
inputshould’ be obtained. On this issue, the ad- ‘
ministration chose to take the matter into its own
hands, studying the issue much_too quickly and
not preparing students for the bombshell that
resulted from its proposal.

Thursday’s IRB meeting showcased this newly
found organization. Atthat meeting, the IRB an-
nounced that it had hired an attorney to represent A
its case should the need arise. Also, instead of a
scattering of reasons for opposing the proposed
policy, the group presented a more rational list of
grievances. The IRB-contends that the proposed

‘ policy violates provisions in the Student Code of 4 y

\ C°“d“°t- . V 7 Now it is time for the board of trustees to act.

‘ ,We/ hope the board will listen to student view-
points on a matter that will directly affect their
lifestyles.  I

Does Anybody Really Know What They Are Fighting For?

By _NICK ARNETT

A few weeks ago, after interview-
ing a member of the Anti-
Imperialist Student Union and
hearing her complaints about how
Carter and other Imperialist devils
were treating Iran poorly, I asked
her what the organization favored.
Irecorded several minutes of silence
as she pondered the question.

“Ymr do support something,

don’t you?”

“Yes...”

“Communism? Socialism?”- ’

“No!”  ‘

This seemed to be a novel
idea—what DO- the Anti-
Imperialists support? Though
eager to spout an over-abundance
of negative" dogma, she lacked a
script for what seemed a reasonable
query. '

There are a number of groups

Here in Pittsburgh, we have the

It would be hard to pronounce.

We mustn’t leave out the anti-
busing people. A bunch of them
recently lost their seats on the city
school board. High school students
are going to schools far from their
homes. It seems only fair to give
them buses. -Otherwise, they’ll
hitchhike and get mugged orraped.

lt’s typical of bureaucrats to

l

favor integration which sends a stu-

_, dent fifteenimiles away, then cut off

his transportation. As a commuter,
I firmly favor busing. '

Last, but not least, there are the
anti-war people. I’m not so sure
where to stand on this issue. I’m
tempted to say I’m wholeheartedly
behind burning villages, men,

swomen and children; seeing blood

and vein, guts and gore. In Arlo’s
words,”“Shrink, I wanna kill!”

Maybe I should be pro-war. It
would certainly demonstrate I’m an
individualist. There are few people
around who like to see entire na-
tions madly throw- nuclear sticks
and stones at one another.

Since it’s entirely unclear to me I

that anything in this world is clearly
good or bad, I’m not sure if it mat-
ters where I stand. I-Iowever,~I
think as far as war is concerned, I’d
better stick to my guns and say I,‘

people, and the Anti-War group?

I’d say it’s democracy, abortion, A

steel company ethics, and school in-
tegration for the first fOur—thing's
which don’t appear in their names.

For the anti-war people, I’d say ’

they’re‘ anti-reality. They’re cer-

tainly not ‘Pro-Lifers if they don’t

consider their own life worth
fighting for.

Each of these causes seems to

Playing before a boisterous
crowd of 15,728, Pitt kept at the
Dukes until a 20-foot jumpshot by
Carlton Neverson ﬁnally gave the
Panthers a 62-61 lead at 4:17.

It was a short-lived lead,
however, because Duke Bruce

Winkler set new Pitt and pool
records in the one- and three-meter
diving events while Greenwell
placed second in three-meter
diving.

“The best thing about this
weekend was the diving of Scott
Winkler and Pat Greenwell,” said
Pantherihead coach Fred Lewis.
“Theyrwere really tremendous.”

Bob Lambert of Pitt finished
third in three-meter diving to
complete a sweep of that event for
the Panthers. Meanwhile, Olymp'ic

In pressure situations, the cream

rightly so. If the loss of a Dwayne

Notre Dame became another Top
'1 7.'5’enty team victimized by the

ACC, dropping a 63-55 decision to -

North Carolina State.

“It doesn’t help us in the
conference,” said North Carolina
State Coach Norm Sloan, “but it
sure helps our conﬁdence; it helps
us psychologically.”

Hawkeye Whitney led the
Wolfpack offense, scoring 23
points. North Carolina State _put
the game away with a torrid second
half, shooting 75 percent from the
ﬂoor after intermission. .

“Because both teams played
with such defensive intensity,
perimeter shooting was the most
important factor,” said Notre
'Dame Coach Digger Phelps.
“North Carolina State shot well

Then -

Meanwhile, the inexplicable
,ACC continued .in turmoil as
Georgia Tech stunned No. 18
Virginia 62-61, and No. 16 Clemson
pulled off a 90-81 upset over No, 7
Maryland.
The ACC wasn’t the only

conference with its share of upsets
Saturday. In the Big Ten, Purdue,
the nation’s 12th-ranked team, was
beaten by Iowa 74-59 and Illinois
routed 20th-rated Indiana 89-68.
Elsewhere, No. 1 De Paul
escaped with a 65-63 victory over

Dayton; No. 2 Syracuse walloped
St. Bonaventure 105-80; No. 3
Louisville stopped Providence 79-

tripped Arizona 73-63; ﬁfth-ranked
Kentucky turned back Alabama
72-63; No. 6 Louisiana State

Also,

from the top of the key over Sam
Clancy. It was Atkins who also
pulled down Neverson’s missed
shot seconds later and _secured the
‘Duquesne victory..

“We are starting to see, Bruce.
Atkins assert himself,” said a
smiling Duquesne coach Mike Rice
after the game. “The problem
before (earlier in the season) was
that he_ wanted to do too much at
once. Today he looked like he
wanted to score.” '2 ‘

Rice continued, “We were afraid
of Ellis going down the stretch,

. especially when he really wants to
score. When he fouled out,-it
wasn’t the crucial foul, but itwas
important.’ ’ _ I
’ Clancy and Atkins turned in

15 points and 16 rebounds, Atkins
with 14 points and 14 rebounds.
Arnold led all scorers with 25
points, followed by Duquesne’s
B.B. Flenory, who had 17. It was
Flenory who ﬁnally put the game
out of reach by hitting both shots in
a one-and-one situtation with two
seconds remaining. A Clancy slam
dunk at game’s end was ineffect-
ual. ‘ ,
Throughout the first part of the
game, Clancy put on a one-man
offensive show by scoring 10 of
Pitt’s first 12 points and turned out
to be the only‘Panther to play the
entire 40 minutes. To say that some
players were in foul trouble would
be like saying ﬂorists do a fair
amount of business around Valen-
tine’s Day. The officiatinglof Brice

consistently close for both sides,
but at times unjustiﬁed. A total of
56 personal fouls were called.

Rutgers’ overtime win against.

West Virginia University _Saturday

«had put the Panthers in the position
j where they can secure a home-

court advantage in the opening
round of Eastern Eight tournament
play by beating Duquesne. With
the Duquesne game history, Pitt
must now win one of its remaining
games with West Virginia, Rutgers
or Villanova. Although yesterday’s
contest is indeed history, it won’t
be forgotten.

“It (the win) gave them the
advantage. going into the playoffs,”
said Clancy, speculating on a
possible rematch in the tourna-
ment. “But it also made us a little

FREE THROWS: Pitt shot an

unspectacular _39 percent from the __

floor, and 68 percent from the
free-throw line...several Panthers,
including Clancy and Lennie
McMillian, wore gray T-shirts
underneath their uniform jerseys: '
“Eight people‘ had the flu already
and it’s so cold in the Arena,”
explained Clancy...Tiger Paul Aus-

lander said before the game that he ,
would attend, but not cheer, out of .

courtesy to the Duquesne cheering
contingent...it’s nice to kn!-w Duke
fans still haven’t forgotten how’
many words _rhyme with "Pitt”...
Duquesne also won the p: e'.iminary
game, the fourth anntai “Rust
Bowl,” played between former
Panthers and Dukes; among the

Panthers were Wayne Williams, L

  Concert Promoters:

  THEBIG THREE

By SCOTT MOWRYT
His modest office is located in the South

whether renting to children's shows like the

' upcoming “Pinochio,” or musicals such as

“Man of La Mancha,” or sponsoring
special theme events like a St. Patrick’s Day
gala featuring _The Clancey Brothers, or
pushing, of course, just plain old rock
n’roll.

For Kresky and Engler.-the concert half
of DiCesare-Engler Productions—the
telephone is their pipeline into the world of
rock‘ and entertainment. Information-is
gathered, attractions are secured, datesare
confirmed and deals are transacted.

On Engler’s desk sit two red phones,

looking not too unlike hotlines to the‘
Crf‘Ei*em1in- while Kresky’s is a large multi-

buttoned job that lights up non-stop
throughout the working day. '

While both men are unique and in-
dividual, their approach to the business
contains many similarities.

At the age of 33, each man has grown up

with rock n’ roll from its birth and they can
trace its development along with their
respective careers.

/3. rnorerS_ AS landlords of The Stanley, they rived in this city, and later the combined

forces of DiCesare-Engler, Kresky has held
his own in the six years he has been a part of
the Pittsburgh concert scene. He sees his
persistent attitude-and aggressive nature as
keys to his success.

“Basically, ‘I don’t like to take “no’ for
an answer...it’s just the refusal to accept
‘no’ or ‘I doubt it’ for an answer when you
want a ‘yes’ and a ‘yes’ is possible. Now
there will be timeswhen I will try to secure a
‘yes’ from somebody for something and I’ll
go through the ringer to get a ‘yes’ out of
them and it’s just not there. When it’s just
not happening, you go through all the mo-
tions to make a ‘yes’.come about and if it’s
not there, you do find it out and you go on
to the next subject—the minute you get a
‘no,"don’t sit there and drool about it.
Take five seconds, kick yourself in the leg

9 and go on to the next thing. There’s too

many barids working today that those that
don’; wish to work for you or can’t work
for you at a particular time, shouldn’t cause
you to stop trying to make a living,” sum-
marized Kresky.

keen business sense honed and ready,
Kresky is surprised at the turn of events that

an agent selling to a promoter buying——the

Ingenuity. and shrewd calculations have

But Kresky shuns the term “innovative,”.
preferring to_ point out that he is doing what
is necessary to stay in business.

“Innovative, maybe on a local level but
really I’m just copying what I’ve seen done
elsewhere. I’m not the creator. Clubs have
been going on alot longer than I have been
in concerts. I see what has been done in
other cities where the concert business has

' been great and I do my best to put a tracing

ter of factly. _ V I

As a transplanted Southern Californian,
Kresky’s conversation is woven with the
memories and antecdotes of a west coast
America lifestyle during the ~1960’s. He
parallels his career with that of rock’s
monumental events (Monterey Pop
Festival, the Hollywood Bowl concerts)
that not only shaped history but his life as
well. .

Having been involved with “a few thou-

- . sand concerts,” either as a promoter or a

spectator, he speaks as not only a pro-
sperous business man but as a true rock
n’roll fan. His knowledge’ of the artists and

their music is vast and accurate. He’s anx-

ious to cite his favorite shows——The Band at
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, David
Bowie and The Spiders from Mars at the
Long’ Beach Auditorium, Van Morrison at
the Syria Mosque in 1973 and Pink Floyd at
Three Rivers Stadium in 1975.

“Pink Floyd blew .me _ away,”
remembered Kresky. “It was one of the
best things I’ve ever seen done in this
business. The crowd—and I know the
crowd loved that concert probably better
than any concert that they’ve seen in this
town because there were 48,000 people who
were cheering. There was a time period

was cheering again. It was one of the best
shows I’ve ever seen,” recalled Kresky. with
great enthusiasm. _ ;

For Rich Engler, the road to success was
equally rock n’roll oriented. From playing
with, managing and husting deals for. his
-own bands, and other local groups in his
hometown of Creighton, Pa., Engler in-
augurated his initial full-scale promoting
activities in places like Erie, J ohnstown and
parts. of Maryland in the late ’60’s and early
’70’s.

Then th'e_call came from an overworked
Pat DiCesare, offering a long term partner-
ship‘. _DiCesare-Engler Productions, Inc.
was launched in 1973. _

In 1976, after laying down a cool $1.35
million, DiCesare and Engler became the
owners of the Stanley Theatre and its
monsterous maintenance costs. To their
credit, they have turned the Pittsburgh
landmark around from a dying Cinemette
theatre‘ to a thriving entertainment hall and
an almost profitable investment.

“I would say the theatre has been a good A

thing for Pittsburgh. As for us, we don’t

really feel that way yet because it’_s_,s,till_

financially a great struggle to keep people
interested," said Engler.

“We try to make the Stanley Theatre a
well-rounded theatre and try to bringin acts
Now, when we try to
broaden that scope of talent, that’s when

. we start to stepping on thin ice, a lot of peo-

we

ple... .

“Alot of people who come are in the au-
dience, if they are down in front they may
think that the place is full but there are alot
of seats in the theatre and these artists want
a lot of money. We would bring more
diverse types of attractions in but if people
would support them but, hey, I understand.

If you don’t want to go you don’t want
to.”

For The Stanley Theatre and DiCesare-
Engler Productions, national" recognition
has come concretely, thanks to Billboard
Magazine, the Bible of the multi-million
dollar music industry. Billboard recognized

’The Stanley on the basis of statistics, profit
and loss figures as the top concert

» auditorium (under 6,000 capacity) in the

nation for the second year running.

“It’s quite an honor, it really is. We real-
ly didn’t set out to break any records or get
any awards. We just wanted to.basically
pay the" bills. And we did so—I guess being
kind of unconscious aboutit,” said Engler
of the award. . ~ .

“This is the best thing that you can
possibly get. That gives other people across
the nation something that will stick in their
minds. The next time a manager or
someone similar comes to Pittsburgh they
say,‘ “Hey, let’s go‘ down to the Stanley
Theatre, everybody’s been going down
there.” People are accustomed to going

~ there and -audiencestrapparently like to go,

there. It’s the thing to do in Pittsburgh. It
really points out that the Stanley not only

brings in good talent and the people in Pitt-‘

sburgh are supporting good talent, but it’s
now recognized nationally. Recognition is
the whole key,” answered Engler.

But besides The Stanley receiving atten-
tion from Billboard, DiDesare-Engler was
voted as the third best promoters in the
country behind the more nationally active
organizations of Bill. Graham Presents in

Oakland‘, California and Monarch Enter: '

tainment of New.Jersey.

Engler views his achievements as a result
of alot of hard work and the right deci-
sions. “We stayed on top of the business.

I Just knowing what acts are out, when

they’re in our direction. Not onlybegin
knowledgeable, but building" more
knowledge for the future on not only new
acts but knowing when to bring back the
old acts. Trying to make the right decisions
is what it all comes down to because there
are a lot of shows out there and we could
have a show in here every night of the week.
But which ones are going to sell and which
ones are not?” _

“The first year, in‘ ’78, that we won the

award we took a lot of chances which did

not really pay off in a lot of the categories.
In .’79 we were a little bit ‘more cautious,

had less shows and we really thought

that,after winning the award the first time,
wedidn’t think that we would get it again,

L -because we were more cautious. So, I guess

everyone else was a little more cautious

around the country,” said Engler chuckl-__ .

ing. In terms of Pittsburgh is it easy or
difficult todetermine what will sell here?

' “In certain categories it gets a bit harder.
With the rock audiences, if the acts are be-
ing played on the major stations in town
and they seem like a concert attraction it

would probably be a good idea,” theorized .

Engler.

“A few types of music are very strong
here,” replied Kreskky Country rock, and
by that I mean, Charlie Daniels, The
Outlaws,the Henry Paul Band, the Mar-
shallTucker Band, Blackfoot, Molly Hat-
chet—these groups all do well in this town.
I’d say that it is one aspect of Pittsburgh
that is different than a lot of other eities.”

It seems that in a town where the British

hard rock once dominated, the country or "

southern rock has become even more
popular. Is that a fair assessment?

“No,” said Kresky, “when Led Zeppelin '

or The Who come around or if it’s the
Moody ‘Blues or Robin Trower—these acts
all do well in this market also.”

‘V‘I think -it’s torn in half,” were
Engler’sthoughts. I think the Cheap
Trick—Bob Seger—Rush audience is very,

very much so, there. I feel that a lot of the '

same kids like the country.” .
As a promoter, is every show a gamble
for you? ' ‘

“Guaranteed gamble. Just like throwing"

the dice, every time. None of them are con-
crete and a reader will look at this and say,
“Aw c’mon, anybody knows that Bruce
Springsteen has got to sell out!” But their
deals are so tough and you've got to sell all

promoters used to make a good amount of

‘money but now the deals are so tight that

wouldn’t get all that money. We'd have to
split it with the act because almost every act
is on a percentage plus a guarantee. From
the promoter’s standpint, the goal is always
to brek even and whether it be the Civic
Arena, The Stanley, The Syria Mosque or
The Decade, Kresky and Engler hope for a
minimum average of fans that will pay the
expenses. Anything beyond that is clean

’ profit for the artist and the promoter.

“Then if it’s a great show and it sells out
or it sells out and ‘it’s a great show,
whichever comes first, because sometimes
great shows don’t,sell out. But, if the show
sells well enough to where we’ve made a
good profit—everybody’s happy.
Everything doesn't sell out all the time and
what we want is just not to lose a lot when
we’re going to lose. If we win, usually we
win big,” stated Kresky. '

Ironically, the record for the largest in-
door crowd was a ’79 show promoted by
Electric Factory Concerts of Philadelphia.
The Outlaws and Molly ‘Hatchet drew
17,524 country rock fans to the Civic Arena
last November. 

Electric Factory often rents dates in the
Stanley (Blondie, The Grateful Dead) but
Kresky, particularly does not appreciate
their business practices in Pittsburgh and
has filed an anti-trust suit against the com-
pany. _

Both Kresky and Engler arequick to
point out how the business has changed
even since their involvement. Artists con-
stantly demand more of the gross, acts and

’ equipment continue to grow larger and all

the auditorium unions charge overtime.
“Before they used to pull up in vans and

contracts that will spell out everything from
limousines to how the meat should be sliced
for the catered dinner.

“Usually at least two pages about food,”
says Engler.

So- what does it take to be a good pro-
moter.

“You have to have the courage to hang in
there on a lot of different projects. You
have to take a,lot of risks,” says Engler.
“You have to do a lot of homework and
research an act, you have to know how to
buy advertising and then -know to sell it to
an audience and know what to say in a
radio spot to try and sell it and after the
people are in there treat them right. See
that the show starts on time, have the peo-
ple feel they got their money’s worth and

make the artists feel that they were produc-

ed by the right people,” recited Engler.
The 1980’s like the ’70’s and the ’60’s will
find concert promoters around the world
pulling out their hair at guessing what will
be the next big thing. Kresky and Engler
are no different but they are calmly confi
dent that whenever the next big thing hap--
pens, they will be quick to realize it. ,
“Maybe the B-52's will be the biggest
thing to hit America.-..but I won’t know
why...said Kresky. And maybe Devo, will
make their dent on America, and I won’t
know why. And I differ these groups from
Kiss, who made it real big but it was more
than, their musical presence that made it
worthwhile for the people who like Kiss.
But in the case of Devo or the B-52’s, not
only do they have a weak visual, in my opi-
nion, but musically they’re very weak. Kiss
was strong musically, whether we critics like
Kiss or not, they were strong musically and
they were strong and dynamic on stage. I
don’t think that groups that are weak will
make it, let’s put it that way. Now, if Devo
came out with a great record, it wouldn’t
matter what they were wearing whether it
be yellow rainsuits orwhatever the hell they
wear. I don’t think that matters. They’re
just tryingto makeit publically‘ A) first
through a visual and B)'th‘rough a musical
and if they don’t make it musically they’re
not going to makeit visually. Whereas, you
could make it musically and you don’t have
to make it visually.”

that can perform real good are going to
make it and I think a- lot of groups are going
to come and go. One example of that right

We stopped accepting applications
for the chairperson positions, but
we’re still accepting applications for

Giangarlo and many student com-
mittees are leaving today on a five-
day convention sponsored by the
National Entertainment and Cam-
-pus Activities Association to take a
look at prospective entertainment to-
’review for next fall’s programming.

“At past conventions,, Redd

Simon and Garfunkel...As a matter
of fact, Earth, Wind & Fire, before
they were big, were charging only
$500 a show.

Films have been one of the most
successful programming operations
at Pitt. One person especially
responsible has been Torn DeSantis,
chairperson of the visual committee.

“I’d say that 90 percent of my
committee's job_is the arranging of

dates, popular films, and space for
the films to be shown. The number
of students in attendance to our
feature films has doubled, and in
some cases, tripled over just last
year. You could call me a
‘numbers’ man, because I pick"
mostly films that were or are
blockbusters in the theatres. We
show three different films per week,
and we usually stick with a winner,
said DeSantis.

three PUPC committees: Enter-’
tainment, Cultural Arts, and Lec-
ture._ Their Chairpersons, Joyce
Berkowitz, Sheila Jones, and Ron ‘
Story respectively have all en-
countered some student apathy, or
problems in programming events
due to Pitt’s lack of sizable
facilities. ‘

‘‘I look at my job as having the

‘purpose of providing a well-
balancedcalendar of entertainment
that students are familiar with,”
said Berkowitz. “I try to program
entertainment which provides
students with the opportunity to at-
tend programs which they couldn’t

they had out “My Sharona” which was a
great record. e If a group like, Journey, for
example, had a “My Sharona,” we’d sell
out THREE nights at the Civic Arena.” .

Engler sees things with a slightly different _.

perspective-

~“All the standard stuff, of course—the

Linda Ronstadts, the Bruce Springsteens,

the Bob Segers and all the acts that are
already established- will,- I think be very

for something really new and different,”
Engler’ prophesized.

“I would guess: that electronic
music—-synthesized and -computered,
bizarre, outrageous, probably something
that will be rejected by society inthe begin-
ning like The Beatles and Elvis Presley.
Something that the kids are really into and
the adults. negative towards. " I think in
order to succeediit will have to defy society
somehow.” ‘ - -

What lies ahead for DiCesare Engler. Pro-
ductions and Danny Kresky Enterprises in
the ’80’s is basically,what they have ac-

« complished in the ’70’s. Bothhave express-

ed strong interests in managing a local act.

A DiCesare-Engler plans to promote concerts

out of the state and out of the country while
Kresly will continue his business ventures
from Michigan to Kentucky.

Wherever their interest takes them, Pitt-

Duquesne To Ilost lforbert -’

By SCOTT MOWRY

'1 ne Duquesne Universtiy ~Pro- '
gram Council and Danny Kresky
Enterprises have joined forces, to
bring Steve Forbert for a concert
appearance on Monday, March 25 _
at the Duquesne Ballroom. Kresky,
who has been committed to bridging
the concert‘ gap between the Stanley
Theatre and the Decade, selected
the 1,800 seat Ballroom as an obvious

‘but experimental choice. A

“I want to be able to utilize the
facility for the purposes that the
school wants the attractions, which
is to give them the type of entertain-
ment that they are seeking,” said
Kresky. “And in the process be
building an act, like Steve Forbert,
to where, if next time he appears in '
town, based on his performance and
success at Duquesne, can come back
to play the Stanley Theatre and"do
the same with other acts so on
down the road,”_ he added.

Forbert, backed‘ by a five piece
band, will be making his -second, —~
visit tothis city after performing at
the Decade last January on the heels
of his brilliant.debut album Alive
on Arrival. Since then, he has
broadened his country-boy-meets-
the-big-city image and his. fresh
Dylanesque music with the more
pop/country direction of his latest. '
LP Jackrabbit Slim. .

The cut, “Romeo’s Tune,” em-
bodies the feeling from the new
album which has been received less
favorably by critics but very en-
thusiastically by record buyers as '
well as both AM and FM "radio.

Forbert’s forte has always been
hisability to blend his wry, off-the-
cuff street humor with basic, mostly
"acoustic instrumentation put across
with his gravelly charming vocals‘.
On Jackrabbit Slim, however, he
has added the sweet, soulful
background singing of the Muscle
Shoals sisters and lush ‘horns which
combine to form a record» of love
songs. '

“The secondalbum is not so
autobiographical as the first was,”
said Forbert of Jackrabbit Slim. _

A “Where Aliveon Arrival hadthe

' theme of a country kid in a big city,

this is more straightforward collec-
tion of ‘songs with no underlying

we took the same approach as on

instrumentation nice and “simple.”

Providing the Forbert date is suc-
cessful, Kresky and the Duquesne

additional concerts. Future shows

women goes somewhat further than the in-
itial feeling elicits. '

Beverly Hills becomes an almost silent V

place, its beauty extending from trees and
lawns and architecture to the men and
women. Julian’s adversaries who pop up
throughout the film are characteristically
baldj or overweight or pimply. Schrader’s
point, however, is not to over-hype but to
insist a depression of a doomed character.
The houses and groves and even people on
the streets are filmed in a hypnotic way.
The silence in subsequent sequences is

’ almost deafening, and the protagonists are

heaped with an intentional falsity.

Julian is being framed for a vulgar sex
murder that he did not commit. But he has"
trouble fighting his way from the
framework of his own making. The

_ vitreous footage hassucked him in, and

toes,” runs without anidea of where to go.

with his feelings over the love of a senator’s
wife (Lauren Hutton). Schrader wants us
to believe that after all these years of pro-
viding favors ‘without extending any mode
for reciprocation, Julian can make the ad-
justment to accepting the love of one
woman. Their love-making is painfully am-
biguous, purposefully on Schrader’s
behalf, and Julian, as well as his environ-
ment, becomes a. fog of perversions and
twists. The audience loses touch with his
earlier seductive boyishness, and he sudden-

A ly becomes a bastard struggling for his very _

existence. Does love, or the threat of bear-
ing a murder rap, change him and blanket
his, character with the undesirable?

It seems that toward the ending, Schrader
himself becomes frustrated with the entire
idea; the director bails Julian out in a
disgusting work of making some fine gaps

Schrader’s film gets to a point where the
ﬁlm-goer feels that it might even transcend
the satire of “Shampoo” with its waxy
bleakness. But the picture’s.entire credibili-
ty drops off toward the end, and we're left
with something that should never have
taken place. Hutton provides the only
shine as a woman manipulating in a little-
lost-po1itician’s-wife way, while Gere is
more of a" fleshy robot who moves as
soullessly as the walk-throughs and cars
around him. His character is much too in-

animate for Schrader to pull the ideal

switch that he does at the end.

‘Sex’ At The Studio

“Sexual Perversity In Chicago”

" Directed by Stephen Wyman

Studio Theater
i
By STAN MOYER

Billed by Dr. Attilio Favorini as “an
experiment in—late~night theatre,” the

‘City Theatre Company, in conjunction

with the University of Pittsburgh, is
producing David Mamet’s, “Sexual
Perversity in Chicago”. Directed by
Stephen Wyman (also in the cast) and
staged in the Studio Theater, the
production is referred to as “late-night”
because of its 11500 showtime Friday and
Saturday nights. and ‘because it's
“an experiment”:in its attempt to ﬁnd an
audience for this play and others that may
follow.

If there isanything that stands out in
this play, it is the unique structure. Just
as the slides of the Chicago skyline at
night that are projected onto the two
screens above the stage left and right. the
play is a group of short scenes or
“snapshots” arranged in chronological
order. The interesting quality about
these “snapshots” is that each one is an
entity in itself. that reveal theabsurdities
that individuals go through in their
personal relationships with both sexes.‘
V Bernie Litko (Joseph Pdato) and Dan
Shapiro (Stephen Wyman) are buddies‘
trying to make it with women. Dan is’
somewhat innocent and pliable to

» ‘_Berni_e:s_ arrogant. —yet.likable, super stud » »'

  

personality. One day Dan meets Deborah.
Solomon (Katie Karlovitz) and the two .
begin to date. Deborah’s friend and
roommate. Joan Weber (Helena Ruoti) is '
a stern feminist who constantly harps on
Deborah -about the
relationship with a man, while'Bernie
condemns Dan .for getting “too serious”
with a woman. _

One cannot help but sympathize with.
all the characters in this play despite their

sometime hate-filled moments. They are ,_

all caught up in the same problem-
“what do words mean and how do-] know
you mean what I mean even though we use
the same words?” And this dilemma is

complicated further when there is an at-.  ‘

tempt to verbalize emotions; misunderstan-
ding and mistrust usually follow.
Wyman’s innocent yet fast-learning.
Dan and Karlovitz’s sincere Deborah are
both funny and touching. Their moments
together are natural, witty and provoking.
Ruoti’s Joan, the embodiment of every
woman hurt deeply by a man, is
convincing and funny. And, Pilate shines
as the arrogant Bernie, keeping up the
laughs with the enthusiasm and comedy
of his character's actions and stories.

Live Snapshots Accompany

The Music And Memories  

‘ The Concerts

‘By Laurie Lewis

Text by Robert Christgau
Paper Tiger/A&W Visual Library

By SCOTT MOWRY

Every picture tells a story, doesn’t it?
Certainly rock ‘n’ roll has attracated its
share -of the written word. Philosphers,
critics and historians alike have loaded
the book racks with their biographies,
encyclopedias, guides and prophecies.
But, “The Concerts” by Laurie Lewis
prefersto let the pictures do the talking
rather than the words.

Containing well over 200 different
photographs, most in living color and
many at least a full page in size, “The
Concerts,” is rock’s answer to Life
Magazine. _ ,

Lavish, glossy and sometimes bombas-
tic, the book falls somewhere between
loosely documentary and lushly aestetic.

_ Filmed in the United Kingdom in 1974
' 4 through 1978, British photoist Lewis has

assembled an impressive roll call
collection of some of rock's most
luminary, most dangerous, and most
unusual’ ﬁgures.

A strong point of “The Concerts’ ’, is its
commemmoration of the gloriously
anarchistic era when English punk

enjoyed its “hey day,” 1976 through

1977. Lewis has captured a great many of
the punkers in their most primative
times: Elvis Costello sporting a shaved
head, members of Generation X looking
all of 18 years of age, and. the Clash
political and

Pitt Jazz Ensemble

powerful. Also junk punk opportunists
like the Adverts. the Lurkers and the
Killjoys. Lewis also catalogued two
separate “Bunch of Stiffs” tours that
featurd the likes of Nick Lowe, Wreckless
Eric, Lene Lovich and the intimable Ian
Dury and the Blockheads.

Most of the big names are here too.‘ But
Lewis appears to own a particular
fascination for The Rolling Stones and
Pink Floyd whose images are scattered
throughout, including the curious front
cover shot which ﬁnds Mick Jagger
fronting the Floyd. Unfamiliar names,
(Hawkwind, Hatﬁeld and the North,
Vinegar Joe, and the Steve Gibbons
Band), at least to U.S. audiences can be

found and the list is split fairly evenly

between’ the superstars and the new
wavesters—-a clear reﬂection of the
musical upheavels «underway during the
mid andlate ’70s. -

For all of Lewis’ commendable
intentions, -“The Concerts,” unfortuna-
tely suffers from a lack of inherent drama
or impact. The photographs must be best
appreciated for their recollection rather
than as statements by themselves.

If you've seen these groups on stage
you will more easily identify with the
book's concept. But sadly, too few ‘of
these bands have made any signiﬁcant
appearances in the U.S. After leaﬁng
through this package, one can't help but
feel slightly envious towards Lewis’
proliﬁc concert attendance.

Without question, Laurie Lewis pos-
sesses a‘ precise talent for color,
composition, portraiture, and action. But

a little more thought and preparation

 

This photo of Joni Mitchell is among many which appear in ”The

Concerts." “'

seems warranted for a project the.
proportion of “The Concerts.” A big
asset would have been locations of
gigs—some are recognizable, most are
not—and exact dates. The arrangments
of the photos, in terms of pace and flow is
haphazard and too often confusing.

Robert Christgau’s introduction helps but
a more structured format throughout is
needed. The $12.50 price is nohelp.

‘-‘The Concerts.” is a good tr)’ but
clearly the rock visual market has _not
been exhausted—yet.'

‘Pitt Jazz Ensemble And Guests Shine At S«.U.

Student Union Lower Lounge

February 1, 1980
By D. ELISHA STUBBS

Last Friday some 250 people had the
pleasure of witnessing a truly remarkable

~ evening of jazz by the Pitt Jazz Ensemble. '

The two part, two-and-a-half hour set
featured some surprising solo work but, not
because it was of such high quality but
rather the quantity and intensity was very
high.

The Pitt Jazz Ensemble consists of
students and instructors of the university’s
jazz program under the ever-so-cool direc-
tion. of Dr. Nathan Davis. The tunes in-
cluded were some straight bop material
“Along Came Betty” to blues “Black Cof-
fee” and even a mid-eastern bop hybrid

“Vijay.” But the special parts of the even-
ing were the featured guests soloists.

Even though the sound system didn’t do
her justic, Mona Riscoe did a great job of
vocalizing on James J ohnson’s arrange-
ment of the night club blues sounding
“Black Coffee”, and the standard bop tune
“All Of Me.”

Marshall McDonald was the featured alto

. saxophonist. Though he seemed a bit ner-

vous on the second tune (“Along Came
Betty”), he got it all together on James
J ohnson’s “Sidewalk” and absolutely hurt
“Lil’ Darling.”

The -real treat of the evening was the
piano work of Geri Allen. Throughout the
evening Allen’s solos "were the highlights of
the music. Rough and intricate on‘ “Along
Came Betty” and Miles Davis’ “Nefertiti”

and just plain marvelous on McCoy Tyner’s ‘

“For Tomorrow”, her touch is similar to

More P.U.P.C.

(Continued from page 4)
- PUPC.”

Sheila Jones felt that her commit-
tee (Cultural Arts) had spent a great
deal of time and effort programm-
ing activities which were good in
and of themselves, yet felt disap-
pointed. by the poor turnouts to
some of the Cultural Arts Commit-
tee’s programs. “The ‘Leon Bates
program of classical music was just
one of the most promising activities
we had this year. It’s sad that
students pass up the chance to at-
tend modern arts like dance, and
traditional arts like chamber music
when most of the events are either
free or inexpensive,” noted Jones.

Ron Story, who chairs. the lecture
committee, saw the possibilities of
expansion bright and hopeful. ‘‘It
only cost the PUPC $2,700 to spon-

A sor Carl Bernstein last term to
speak on a highly relevant topic, _
that of the direction the media is_

 going in. That's how we pick lec-
turers, first from the topic, and

then from what our pocket can af-
ford. If the new student activities
fee is enacted, it will mean more
money for the PUPC and that will
give Pitt students the chance to see
faces they’re more familiar with,
although the emphasis is put on br-
inging articulate speakers, because
cost is secondary,” said Story.

Chris Rasmussen, chairperson of
the Recreation committee, is respon-
sible for coordinating leisure sports
activities and games although occa-
sionally he programs entertainment-
geared events. An example which is
most current is the performing of
an escape artist. _ -

For the most part, student atten-
dance has been the indicator used to
determine whether or not future
film programs, concerts, readings,
lectures, or tournaments are held.
all chairpersons see the future of
Pitt programming dependent upon
active involvement by the students
to be a part of the planning of ac-
tivities on the various committees.

Chick Corea with the harmonic insight of
McCoy Tyner.’

The ninth song of the set was a real ‘I

delight. It featured» Indian sitarist Vijay
Bazaz Razdan. Davis composed aspecial

_Mid-eastern sounding tune appropriately

named “Vijay” especially for the everring
concert. Razdan played an elongated sitar
solo and was later joined by Davis on
soprano sax. The overall exchange left the
audience in awe. . ,

As if all of this wasn't enough, there were
two more guests. The first was tap dancer

S Saxy.Williams who tapped and shufﬂed

through three tunes including “Bo J angles”
and “Sweet Gypsy Rose.” '

The final guest was well known studio
trumpeter, Lew Soloff. He is formerly of
Blood, Sweat & Tears. The six tune set with
Soloff and the Jazz Ensemble rhythm sec-
tion was highlighted by impromptu versions

of “Someday My .Prince Will Come,”
Charlie Parker’s “N ow’s The Time,” and a
marvelous duet of Rogers and Hart’s “My
Funny Valentine,” performed by Soloff
and Allen. Soloff revealed to the audience
that they had never practiced the tune
together and promised that the perfor-
mance would be very spontaneous and it
was. Soloff was more than adequate and
once again Allen left the audience
mesmerized.

For those of us who. witnessed this per-‘
formance there was nothing to be desired.

with every-appearance. If you missed this
performance and would like tohear the

ensemble, they will be appearing at the First‘

Center stage, Combo Tactic, formerly
theAShakes, excites its audience to move
with pulsating and melodious rhythms.
Tracy, Hugh, Bill, and Michael challenge
their audience to realistically assess modern
living in 19805 America, with crisp lyrics
that make a difference...They are a cooly
radiant mosaic of impious wholesomeness,
collective individuality, and directed tur-
bulence. They are a band to be taken.
seriously, with a sense of humor.

What is most impressive about Combo
Tactic is their versatility. They all write.
They all sing. Best of all they can all play
each others’ instruments. “One person
writes a song to begin with, and then each
person adds his own part. But the final
product is always a mix of what everyone

’ wants to put in it,” explains Michael. Com-.
bo Tactic together creates their own
category of New Wave music.

When asked to define this ‘category,’
Hugh retorts, “It began as Progressive
Bubble Gum, evolved to Neo—Psychedelic
Jiffy Pop and simultaneously No Pop. Jiffy
Pop came from a desire to be ready in a
hurry, play faster, and taste good.”

Hugh Esten was born in Washington

. D.C., lived in Silver Spring, Md. until he

was 18, when he came to CMU where he is a
directing major.. He’s been writing songs
since he was. 12, admitting, a“. . .only the
words, I had trouble putting them to
music.” At 14 he began actingand study-
ing dance and ‘mime. It wasn’t until five
years later that he learned to play guitar.
Even then it was slow in going _until Michael
and Tracy began helping him. The three of
them met as freshmen at CMU in 1976, and
Tracy and Hugh began writing songs
together in the fall of ’78. As a trio their
first collaboration was in January of the
following year when they performed “Bob-
by Angel” at the Theatre Express with
'Michael Kaniecki and Jimmer Podrasky
who are now members of the Rave-Ups.

“Bobby Angel” was a theatre piece writ-
ten by Hugh, involving narration, a rock
band, and live stage action. Tracey,
Michael and Hugh did the musical ar-
rangements. As Combo_Ta_ctic,. they "still
perform three songs from the play; “Bulls
Eye,” “Pumping Gas,” and “Bobby
Angel.” ‘

On stage, Hugh projects the appearance
of Aryan austerity with authoritative eyes
and terse movements of controlled spon-
taneity. On lead guitar, he offers a pro-
vocative performance with spanky, spicy
riffs, all part of a clean, hard-driven sound.

ba beats, and
I would play “Raindrops Keep Falling on
My Head” all day long at the mall. I was 16
at the time. . .,” Tracy recalls. Michael in-
terrupts, “just right for those middle
aged. . .,” Hugh completes his sentence,
“people who need new organs.” Tracy con-
tinues, “I still have an affection for those
organs and I would like to use the rhythm
generator part of them. I_t’s really'a subur-
ban sound and I really associate it -with
those things that I would like to incorporate
into our music. Andshe does.

In two of Tracy’s songs, “The Pledge
and The J oy.” and “Man Club,” her lyrics ,
her voice and her sneering synthesizer reveal
a sense of suburban suffocation. “Go to
work in Daddy’s big corporation/Lots of
money is your motivation/Break some
fingers on the corporate ladder/Can’t step
lightly now that your so much fatter.”

Tracy likes the energy one gets from per-
forming. “I like‘-the idea of being physical-

, ly there when presenting something.” Yet,

behind the keyboards her wide-eyed preoc-
cupied stare makes one think she’s
somewhere else and her pull pouty mouth
makes one think that she wishes she ‘was.
Still she is there, adroitly interspersing hum-
mable harmonies with daring discordance,
sometimes’ even allowing the synthesizer to
play without her. There is a vital sassiness
in her voice, contrasting and harmonizing
nicely with the other three.

that “simple
and he acknowledges the importance of

. cooperative effort using everyone’s ideas to

determine what is best.

From the pre-war suburb of Shaler_

Township, Michael has been playing bass
for fifteen years. In high school he played
in a band with Tom Moran, now with The
Dark. Michael and Hugh began working
together while Hugh was directing the Ger-
trude Stein play, “Every Afternoon.”
Together they created an “audial environ-
ment” for the play. .

Physically intense and resolute, his per-
sonna enhances Combo Tactic’s visual ef-
fect of a squad of _Eastern European
soldiers. More importantly, he heightens
the musical bite of the band by providing a
strong, ﬂuid and funky bottom. _

remarks, “We are the first generation to be
nannied by the TV. ‘We spent more time
watching TV than we did talking to our
mothers. And the mall got really boring. I
like to think my music has been influenced
by TV commercials.” Hugh adds, “We use

It is important to Combo Tactic that
their music be original and danceable.’ Not
only because they like to dance, but also

‘_ because, “It’s so healthy for people who

If ‘you get a load of Combo Tactic, you’ll

Styx/The Babys
Civic Arena
February 4, 1980

People were scurrying around outside the
Civic Arena on the freezing night of
February 4, trying to secure tickets to see
"the 1979' Peoples Choice Awards Best
Band—Styx. The concert was a sellout,

 ' even after 1,200 last-second additional seats

‘ A» , keyboardist

- were hastily added,‘due to the fact that fans

still held on to their tickets from the original
date of October 30, when Styx was forced

  it  toicancel because of the labor strike at the

Arena. .
From their ten albums Styx concentrated

 on the music from the “Equinox,” period
’ on.

“Borrowed Time,” “Great White
Hope,” “The Grand Illusion,” “Lady,”

‘C-1 and “Lights” were played to the singing
‘ crowd. The band was tight, but paused in
’ between most of their songs for some

unknown reasons, making the crowd a bit
edgy. However, on the majority of the
“AM” pop-rocker, the audience was
treated-to a pleasing performance.

Styx took command of the crowd mid-
way through the show, when the tiny power
pack of the group, Tommy Shaw got the
audience to clap out a beat to the acoustic-

A “guitar of “Crystal Ball,” and then had

everyone rocking to “Renegade.”

The other main ingredient in the group,
and lead vocalist Dennis
Deyoung was nothing short of great, as he

A showed his wizardry on the ivories for the
‘shows finales, “Babe,” and “Come Sail

Away.” V
Styx rushed through 15 songs in less than
two hours possibly because its major North

- American tour had been completed. After

a long ovation, they came back for one en-
core of substantial duration. They also

paused to give the audience a glimpse of '

their award which they deservingly receiv-
ed.
From the U.K. to Pittsburgh, the Babys

I opened up the show with basic rock n’ roll

that touched the new wave.
