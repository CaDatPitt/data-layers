‘Human Relations Problem’

Prejudice Discussed

According to Robert Happs,
chairman oi‘ the Human Relations
Committee at the University, “the
prejudicial attitude of many stu-
dents is the primary problem fac-
ing the University in the area of
human relations.” '

Following the first. nieeting of
the Human Relations Commitee,
Hepps met with Bernard Adams.

special assistant to the Chancellor.’

Adams agreed with the commit-
tee that the Men’s Conference and
Women's Seminar programs should
be implemented in an attempt to
change prejudicial attitudes. How-
ever, like the committee, he was
not sure that this attitucic
be changed. or it’ it could. lmxv.

Encourage Grant Attempts

The report stated that. “qu.aii-
ﬂed Negro students could be en-
couraged to apply to the Univer-
sity by sending small group:-' of
our interested students to llltll‘
high schools."

This, Hepps and Adams feet.

could ‘

could help erase the “discrim-
iﬂatory myth” about the Uni-
versity. They want these in-
terested students to encourage

qualiﬁed Negro students “to ap-
ply for scholarships which they
now mistakanly believe ti) be
beyond their reach.”

Adams stated that both football
coach John Michelosen and Stu-
dent. Aid Director Earl Fielder
were going to take action on the
attitudes of some football players
toward Negroes and other minor-'
ity groups.

Michelosen said he woulcl “do-
everything possible to correct this
situation——it‘ necessary by impos-
ing severe penalties.”

Fielder said he would “not hesi-
tate to use his power to bring
about more favorable conditions."

The Human Relations Commit-
tet had met to discuss the reasons
for the scarcity of Negroes at the,
University. . |

How TO BE A Bwoc

Ladies, let me be frank. The days of the college year dwindle
down to a precious few. And some of you—let's face it—have
not yet become BWOC’s. Yes, I know, you've been busy what
with going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,
becoming a BWOC is so easy if you’ll only follow a. few simple
rules.

The first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very

careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is A

bound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,
“HEY! LOOKIT ME!” Don't you make such a horrid gaffe.
On your placard put: “ZUT! REGARDEZ MOI!” This, as
' you can see, lends awhole new dimension of tone and dignity.

Once you have been ndticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make
distinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you cry, “Whippoorwilll” you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers. V A

V\’e come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BW()C—-
indeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the
BWOC clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,
it is not too much to say, a way of life. °*

This spring t-he “little boy look” is all the rage on campus.
Every coed, in a mad eilort to look like a. little boy, is wearing
short pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BW()()‘ is doing
more. She has gone the whole hog in achieving little boyhood.
She has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her

upper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot. —

All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic fem-
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only

by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely '

coiiied, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail. Her

    

 

Uarzz’ )@g_l /ac dcéicf/Orr;/ﬂdfé/zél.

daytime sneakers have been replaced by fashionable high
heeled pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to
the movies. , ,

After the movies, at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will mrer, izmrer, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttonyand can only cause one’s date
to blanch. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is class and is
the hallmark of the true BVVOC.

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigaret-to vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, “Marlboro,
of course!” For any girl knows that a. Marlboro in one’s hand
sta.mps,one instantly as a person of taste and discernment, as
the possessor of an educated palate, as aconnoisseur of the liner,
lof tier pleasures. This Marlboro, this badge of sa.2>oir-fmirr>,
comes to you in ,flip—top boxes that ﬂip, or in soft packs that are
soft, with a filter‘ that ﬁlters and a ﬂavor that is ﬂavorful, in all
ﬁfty states of the Union and Duluth. o iuoz Max Sllulma-I

Board Discuss ‘
‘Assistance’

An agreement that the Stu-
dent Union Board and the
staff of radio station WPGH
could be of assistance to each
other was made at a meeting
of both organizations.

The Union will allow WPGH to
tape their future programs and to
have free use of their records for
the station's music program. SUB
will announce in its Pitt News
advertisement the coming pro-
grams that will be heard on
WPGH.

The staff of WPGH is consider-
ing a ﬁfteen-minute show to an-
nounce what activities are going
on in the Student Union.

Meets With Saga

In addition, the possibility of
using the Hunt Room for organ-
ized social functions of the Union
was discussed in a meeting with
A Saga Food Service.

A series of entertainment pro-
grams will be planned which in-
cludefolk singers, jazz, small
dance combos, poetry reading,
and one act plays. The Hunt
Room will be transformed into
a club atmosphere with table-
cloths and candles. Students can
come with or without dates.

The Union is trying to obtain a
new player piano to replace the
one that is presently in the Hunt
Room.

Response Test

Three of these programs will be
planned for this trimester to test
students’ response. They will not
be replacing the regular Student
Union dances, but will supple-
ment them.

Jerry F. Johnson, public rela-
tions director of the Student Union

Board, told the Ritt News, “The

tivities is part of what we feel is

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS

‘;..a.v'

After. Dinner What? . . .

Romanticism

Romanticism is difficult to discuss nowadays be-
cause we have reached the point where it is be-
neath serious argument. In these stern times no
red-blooded man would admit to being a romantic

By Bill Mawhinney ‘

 

“I will life up mine eyes unto the hills,” thereby '

giving both the scene and the psalm more vivid
meaning. “‘

The romantic submits that it is be_tter to ‘lift up '

any more than he would confess a liking for poetry.
Romanticism in its "deepest
sense is the conviction that man
is’ ‘fundamentally higher" than
the other animalsbecause he has
a soul——“man does not live by
bread alone.”

“Christianity is not unique in 3
this in s i s tie’,-n c e on spiritual I

‘values; many religions identify
man with God,’ .'£t,is-n’t even es— _
sential to put spirituality on a
reli.gi_ou_s basis at all. Many: an '
agnostie is, s.piI‘itua,.l; he, may
prefer the term “ethics’,’———but he’s still expressing
the human aspiration to be -a_ rung above the cow
in "the ﬁeld. .

Is it really so preposterous to feel the imme-
diacyiof a ﬂower in a wall? Can’t we admit the
bare possibility tllat, as Tennyson said, if we could
understand, we really" -would know? what God and «
man is? Hold on a minute, I hear the practical
\7OiC§:s. cry, what you are talking about is escapism.

‘ We got over that years ago. That stuff doesn’t put
a buck in your pocket or a steak on the table.
Does Not Stop Eeoﬁng

Granted. The romantic d.oes not suggest that
we stop eating. Obviously the senses are a pre-
requisite to the enjoyment of beauty, and the senses
are a function of being alive, which in turn depends
upon eating. The romantic has no monkish abhor-
rence of'the physical satisfaction. On the contrary,
he enjoys them all the more because his imagina-V
tion gives them a spiritual depth beyond the mere
titillation of neryes and the sating of appetite. He
will go even further and agree with whoever it
was who said that the greatest symphony ever

. composed can’t compete with the dinner bell.

But having eaten dinner, the human being can
turn to other things. And the other things are pre-
cisely the things that distinguish man from the
brute animals. Unlike the animals, he is capable
of feeling an emotional responseto the sight of
mountains with the sun rising behind them. In
such a moment he might recall the 121st. Psalm;

our eyes untother hills than to scrabble in the con-
tents of the garbagegcan at our feet. Although the
miracles born of man’s genius. have been trans-

Basis of Civilization . . . .-

The real strength of democracy lies in the in.
destructible human spirit that rises above all the
waves of total_itarianism’s transitory triumphs. All
great civilizations have been based on strength of
spirit. When the spirit weakens, when corruption
replaces ideals, the barbarians sweep down from‘
the ‘hills and take over. And every time we laugh
over a crooked’ politico and forget it, -every time
we abandon an ideal, we chip another stone out
of our citadel of strength. '

  Room at tlm Inn

Four years ago almost every magazine in the-. country
speculated on the college boom. “When your child is ready
for college, will college be ready for him?” was the major
problem facing anxious education-minded parents.

Today that predicted Jorood of door—pounding enthusi-

‘ asts can scarcely be heard as college doors all over the
‘country swing open in an attempt to attract more and
‘better college material.

One look at Pitt’s recruitment program belies the myth

that there is no room in the inn. More and more ways are
. produced daily not only as an incentive to attract students,
but to keep them here once they are accepted.

‘In additionto two well-known methods of recruitment
—— athletic scouting and the opportunities presented by a
good press — Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary
fraternity, and Phi “Eta Sigma, freshman honorary, re-
cently added their aid in the competition for better students.
Student- conducted tours around campus are arranged
through the Dean of Men’s ofﬁce for any prospective fresh-
men and their parents. Through these informal conversa-
tions, it is hoped that students as well as administrators will

_ be able to sell the university. ' -

WELL --l-lA6N‘T GMOKEP FOK A WEEK.’

The romantic doesn’t wander around with a lily
in his hand reciting poetry. He simply has faith
in sentiment, imagination and idealism, all of which
are anthema to the totalitarians. He’s the stupid
guy who volunteers, the guy who falls on the
grenade to save his buddies, the guy who thinks
there may be something more important than his
own skin. ‘ 4

The romantic goa, beyond ethics?--romanticism
is the icing on the cake of the human spirit. He‘
feels that even living ethically and observing high- *'
er standards the brutism of the world is not
enough. The complete human being must also savor
the beauties of the world in terms of the spirit,
consider the violet as well as the sirloin steak. Any
dog can enjoy a steak. It is only man who can en-
joy a violet.

SPECIAL REPORT
WPGH will broadcast to-

BY JACKI KATZ
N. Ronald Pease, associate

‘V dean of men at the University,

is alsoadvisor to the Inter-
Fraternity Council and one of
three advisors to Student
Government.

As advisor to SG, Pease serves
primarily in a functional capacity.
He works with various commit-
tees such as Homecoming, Kiski

Day, and Recognition of Student’

Organizations.

Working closely with IFC is his
major responsibility as advisor to
that group. Pease helps establish
policies regarding pledge proce-
dures» Dublish -the fraternity
handbook and newspaper, and
serves on the Greek Week ‘com-
mittee.

Deﬁnes SG’s Purpose

Pease feels “that any univer-
sity campus should havean or-

ganized s t u d e n 1: government
whose purpose is to serve the

I students. “The primary problems

in American colleges today is
making this organization work,”
he said. “The basic responsibility
of SG rests with the individual
student. If there is not an inter-
ested student body then there
cannot be an effective SG.”
Concerning the new SG, Pease
stated that students should not
think that the transition from
a moderately eﬁective SG to an
exceedingly _ effective SG is
made possible. just by the
change. “The most important
thing is the interest of the s-tu-
dent body and the caliber and
efﬁiciency of the individuals
who make up the new SG.”

The responsibility of IFC is to

evaluate their progress along
with their shortcomings, and to
deﬁne their weaknesses and plan

'for proper action. Pease stated

“that IFC has grown in strength
in the past year. IFC members
have grown by virtue of experi-
ence gained carrying out respon-
sibilities within the framework.
“One of the biggest reasons for
having any student organization
on campus is to serve as a learn-
ing experience, and to know how
to co-operate, "participate, and at-
tain the ability to carry out re-
sponsibility,” he concluded.

HECTIC ACTION IN 130-pound class shows Pitt’s Sherm Moyer
on bottom of pile, maneuvering to escape from Lehigh’s Pat Smartt.
Moyer lost the match, however, where a win would have won the

of it. We felt that we would have
a much better chance of heat-
ing them if they were in a man-
fgor-man defense. It would have
worked if the boys hadn't got
sloppy late in the game.”

For the night, the Panthers shot
as well as any pro team hitting
on 19 for 41 from the ﬁeld and
15 of 17 from the foul stripe.
They lost the game from the foul
line as Westminster took twice
as many charity tosses.

Cal Sheffield, who started the
game on the bench, turned in a
ﬁne performance, connecting on
ﬁve of seven from the floor and
seven for seven from the foul
line to lead the Panthers with 12
points. Dave Sauer added 11 for
a total of 33 in his last two games.

Champions

Two sectional titles have al-
ready been decided in the Uni-
versity Intramural Basketball
League. Holland Nine has notch-
ed their dorm section already,
with an unbeaten 4-0 mark. The
Schenley Division winner is the
Drifters with a perfect 5-0 mark.

Both of these teams automatic-
ally qualify for the round—robin
tourney at the culmination of di-
vision play when the different
sectional winners will meet in
play-offs to decide an over-all
champion. ‘

In the Independent League the
Pitt News Owls hold forth in the
Southern division with a 3-0
mark. They meet the Hawks
(2-0) this week in an important
match which could decide the
loop winners.

The NADS are one game away
from clinching the Northern Di-
vision crown with a 4-0 record.
Apartment “C” (3-0) are the onl_'(
serious challenger to their bid.

Few games have been played in
the Western Division and it’s still
_anyone’s title. The Dent Sophs
(2-0) beat the Dent Frosh, 45-31,
last week to challenge the P.H.
Colt/s ‘(3-0) for the lead.

The Buckeyes (4-0) beat the
Hunters, ~ 73-57, for the latter
team’s ﬁrst loss, but the Hunters
have issued a protest because of
the Buckeyes using players that

The Civils (4-0) are tops in
the Engineering League and both

Then disaster struck. Tom Jeffries’ apparently safe 4-2

lead over Chuck Moore, which if
held would have given the Cats
the win, quickly evaporated and
for all intents and purposes the
match was over. The ﬁnal tally
read 17-14, Lehigh.

Moore’s win pulled Lehigh to
within two points of the Pan-
thrs, 14-12. From the start of the

heavyweight match it was obvious
that it was only a question of
Whether the Engineers’ John
Burns would decision or pin Jeff
Ware. He did the latter as Ware
was no match for his speedier
and craftier foe.

Big Crowd

The largest crowd ever to wit-
ness a home Pitt wrestling match,
3,810, saw the Panthers jump off
to an early lead and hold it until
the ﬁnal match.

After Rich Martin had easily
pinned Bill Ottinger and Pat
Smartt had downed Sherm
Moyer, to make the score -5-3,
John Zolikoff and "Curt Alexan-
der took the mat for an exciting
bout

Zolikoff appeared headed for
his first loss of the season when
Alexander reversed him with 45
seconds remaining to take a 2-1
lead. Zolikoff fought furiously for
the remaining time and was re-
warded with an escape with ﬁve
seconds left. He picked up an-
other point for riding time to
win, ,3-2.

Kelvington Wins

The teams exchanged wins in
the next two matches. Daryl Kel-
vington dominated Doug Koch to
win 4-1 and Kirk Pendleton out-
classed Augie Arrigone to score
an 8-2 triumph.

Panther hopes skyrocketed in

the 167 pound match when Jim

hind, scoring a reversal and a
take down for his four points.

With a commanding 14-6 lead,-«

the Panthers, needed just one
more win to ice the match. It
never came. Ken Barr lost his
ﬁrst match of the year to Eastern
champion Jim Detrixhe, 2-0.

Almost Won .

It looked like Pitt had the bad-
ly needed win when J effries scor-
ed a take down against Moore to
go in front, 4-2, with 38 seconds
left. But, Moore battled from un-
derneath and reversed Jeffries
with 15 seconds remaining and
then put the'Panther in a near
fall position, to rack -up ﬁve
points. Jeffri-es’ reversal in the

closing seconds only made the

score close.

It was all over in less than
four minutes of the ﬁnal match
when Burns “showed Ware the
lights.”

A sad but not completely de-
jected Pitt team sat head in
hands on one side of the locker
room while on the other side
Lehigh coach Gerry Leeman

Leéman was critical of his op-
ponents. “Pitt has a good team

DePasqua expressed some.of the sensitive points of Pitt’s
- recruitment program. “A lot of kids like to go where they know
they're not going to have to work hard. They have a fear of
Pitt’s academic program.

“Our biggest complaint,” he exclaimed, “has revolved around
 our campus. There’s not enough grass and playthings. But we’re
 able to overcome this because of our ﬁne rooming facilities. The
 acquisition of the new dorms has eased our burden quite a bit. The
 new dormitories will be an even greater improvement.”

C Cecconi interjected a comment, saying, “They complain about
being too near their homes, but we show them that the average dis-
tance of our ballplayers from home is only 36 miles. All of these,

,, other guys can’t be wrong, we tell them.”

  

At P&G, it is not unusual for men in their late twenties and early thirties to
reach a level of management where they are responsible for a sales force of ,
