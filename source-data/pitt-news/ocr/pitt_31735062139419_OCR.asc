Cromie Discusses
European Affairs
At Inquiry Forum

‘ ‘ Hungary Received Dirtiest Deal,’ ’
Declares Council Secretary
At Wednesday Meeting

Discusses Alliances

Leonard J, Cromie, traveling secre-,
tary for the Intercollegiate Council,’

discussed recent European political
movements and the -zonﬂict between
Hungary and Jugoslavia at the week-
ly meeting of Inquiry Wednesday in
Room 107, Alumni hall.

“Hungary's grievance dates from
the World war when in the peace set-
tlement she received the dirtiest deal
of all the nations,” Mr_ Cromie said.
“The Little Entente composed of
Jugoslavia, Rumania, and Czechoslo-
vakia was formed largely from her
territory. Italy is backing her for
economic reasons.

“A sore point with Jugosla.via,” he,
the attempt of Italy to‘

added, “is
make of the Adriatic sea an Italian
lake. As this is the only sea outlet
which the Jugoslavians have, it is a

tions. France is backing Jugoslavia
mainly because she wants no revision
of the post-war treaties.”

In regard to the political situation
in Europe as a whole, Mr_ Cromie
said, “It is a vicious trend of little
eddies which has had its greatest in-
crease since Hitler came into power
in Germany, Hitler began persecuting
the Communists which led to a break
between Russia and Germany, and an
alliance between France and Russia
as opposed to Poland and Germany.

“A second inﬂuence of Hitler has
been to divide European countries in
regard to their internal policy and to
unite them in their foreign policy.”

Trustees Accept
Relics Oi Foster

Lilly Donates Rare Collection To
Composer’s Memorial '

Josiah Kirby Lilly’s Fosteriana, the

finest collection in the world of
Stephen C. Foster's manuscripts, pub-
lished works and relies, was accepted
as a gift from Mr. Lilly to the pro-
posed Stephen Foster memorial by the
University board of trustees early this
week.

The material is. now housed in .a
stone church-like building called Fos-
ter Hall, on the farm of Mr. Lilly in
Indianapolis. When he ﬁrst learned
of .the effort in Pittsburgh to construct
a memorial to the great composer he
contributed liberally toward the fund,
and promised that if the project was
to go through he would give to it his
entire collection of Fosteriana, for

which he has spent more than $160,- -

000. As soon as plans for the shrine
were completed, and the necessary
funds raised, Mr, Lilly offered his col-
lection.

This collection will be housed in
the hexagonal shrine which is about
40 feet in diameter and which is con-
nected with the main Foster Memorial
building by cloistered passages The
shrine is to contain mural paintings
illustrating various Foster songs, and
the windows will carry symbols of the
spirit of Foster. The shrine will be
open to the public. Among the funds
raised to complete the memorial was
$7,000 raised by Pittsburgh school
children.

The material in the collection given
by Mr. Lilly includes: a book of
original manuscripts in Foster’s hand-
writing of the ﬁrst drafts of almost
all his songs written between 1851
and 1860; an account book with rec-
ords of his royalties; personal corre-
spondence by and to Foster; letters
and documents of the Foster family;
personal possessions of the composer;
portraits of Foster and members of
the family; all of his works so far
discovered; all editions of Foster's
works ever published; biographies of
him; and all newspaper clippings,
books, magazines, etc., which contain
accounts of Foster’s works_

Mr, Lilly is also sending Fletcher
Hodges, curator of Foster hall, to the
Memorial for a period of two years.
During this time Hodges will train
some one to take permanent care of
the collection.

At Dr. Wright's

Dr. Verne C. Wright, assistant

in the Yuletide festivities of his
household.

MFS. Wright presented him with
a seven-pound, ten-ounce baby

explorer explained From Alaska to
Tokio is half the distance from Hono-
lulu to Tokio. He described Charles
A. Lindbergh's recent ﬂight to Asia
as being questioned by newspapers
because of the “roundabout” route
the ﬂyer had chosen.

“Lindbergh saved 3,000 miles by
ﬂying north to Alaska, across the
Bering Straits then south to Japan,”
he said. He also explained that a
route directly east to Paris from New
York was longer than the northern
a.rc-like route Lindbergh had chosen
in his first ﬂight. .

“Yet the Arctic ocean is not an
ocean but a sea,” the explorer said.
“From Pittsburgh to Japan by a north-
ern route, there would be but 40
miles of open sea water_ The Arctic
most of the time is a frozen waste.” ’§

Finally Dr. Stefansson blamed news-
papers for so inaccurately describirig

‘Gates’ Divided _
Evenly Between 
Pitt, Visitors

Gate receipts from the Southern
California, Minnesota and Notre Dame
games this year were divided evenly
between the athletic departments pf
the University and of the visiting:
schools, according to an interview
yesterday with John Weber, business
manager of the University, clarifying
newspaper accounts that showed an
apparent difference in receipts.

“The University athletic depart-
ment naturally paid certain direct
costs of the games played in the sta-
dium, however, which were subtract-
ed from the U11iversity‘s share of the
receipts,” Mr. Weber said. It was ex-
plained that similar arrangements
were made with VVest Virginia, Ne-
braska and Navy. and that these

schools paid costs of games Pitt
played away from home this year.

Separate arrangements were made
with Carnegie Tech, VV. &. J., and
Westminster.

Coeds Compete
For Sing-Song
Cup And Glory

\Vho will win the Interclass sing?

three times, the winning class will be
awarded a new trophy each year.

ﬁcers of the ROTC will oiiicially tap
the honorary coed cadet. captains.
After the ceremony, the ofiicers and

under arches of sabers.

The criteria. for judging are the
same as last year: class spirit, 30
points; cleverness and originality of
presentation, 25 points; originality
and cleverness of words, 20 points;
musical ability, 15 points; and num-
ber of class in attendance, 10 points.

The judges chosen by the commit-

tee are Dr. John Geise, chairman;
Miss Ellen Geyer, Dr. Lotte Lobs-

By Charles B. Holstein

The third regular meeting of
the Asseinbly of Student Faciiliy
Association Tuesday evening,
which was attended by a sizcable
number of interested spectators,
resulte(_l in the discussion of the
following nieasuresz

(1) A motion to define and
specify the powers and functions of

the Executive committee,

(2)

Acceptance of new forms for

 the Organizations and Appointments
, , _ i committees.
HO VVILL RECEIVE her comm1s- 

(3) Adoption of new rules and

(-1-) Embarkation on a program of
freshman customs for men and a dif-
ferent system of freshman orienta-
tion.

(5) Decision of SPA to sponsor a
series of afternoon dances at the Ho-
tel Schenley at moderate prices.

(6) Organization of a second-hand
book exchange to take over the func-
tion previously carried on by VVSGA.

(7) Rejection of a motion to co-
operate in a proposed national ‘Who's
Who for college students.

(8) Acceptance of a proposed in-
tramural basketball league.

(9) Approval of a suggestion to
meet regularly every three weeks, in-
stead of monthly, wherever changes
do not conﬂict with the University
calendar. _ '

(10) Favorable decision on the
suggestion of establishing a Univer-
sity newsreel theater which would be
a start toward visual education.

(11) Approval of a plan for a sub-
freshman week in the spring.

Between 60 and 70 members and
spectators attended the meeting in
the Hotel Schenley Sun room.
The session was somewhat long and
drawn out, but was marked by inter-
ested discussion and debate. Leon-
ard Marks, C35, chairman of the Exec-
utive committee, presided.

The motion to deﬁne powers of the
Executive committee included four
points and definitely designated the
lﬂxecutive body as the administrative
organ of the Assembly, which still
retains all legislative and judicial
functions as originally granted by
the Constitution. The motion was in-

troduced 337 Helen Milliron, C35,
chairman of the Constitution coin-
mittee.

Favor Freshman Customs

Charles Herald’s customs commit-
tee submitted a report favoring the
adoption of customs for first year men.
The plan of his committee is still ten-
tative, but includes the identiﬁcation
of all freshmen with -no idea. of lead-
ing to hazing. The present orienta-
tion course and program are also
slated for revision by this group.

Jack Hammerschmidt, C35, pre-
sented his plans for the sponsoring
by SFA of a series of afternoon
dances. Hammerschmidt was ap-
pointed an ex-officio member of the
social committee to supervise a dance
about the middle of next month. A
moderate admission price will be
charged.

Enlarge Book Exchange

The new book exchange may be
granted space in the Cathedral, and
will attempt to aid both undergrad-
uate and professional students in pro-
curing nsed texts. WSGA formerly
conducted an exchange of this type,
but expressed a willingness to have
SFA take over its supervision.

The newsreel theater was ﬁrst sug-
gested by Miss 'I‘hyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women, who investigated a like
theater at the University of Minneso-
ta. Theodore VV, Biddle, assistant
dean of men, has been authorized to
determine its potentialities on this
campus. So far, preliminary arrange-
ments to present both current news-
reels and educational features at a
nearby theater have been discussed.
The project is considered feasible
only if it can be run by charging only
a negligible sum of money.

To Visit High Schools

Israel 7.. Goldberg. C36, chairman of
the speakers extension bureau, ro-
uorted that numerous engagements
have been secured at district high
schools for the glee club quartet, and
that a list of student speakers for
high school extension work is being
prepared.

Leslie Wilkins. C35, has been ap-
pointed to work with Frank VV.
Shockley, director of the extension
division, in an SFA sponsored sub-
freshman week in the spring, to
which high school students within ap-
proximately a 200-mile radius would
be invited to become acquainted with
the University. Wilkins suggested
the project, which was received fa-
vorably by the Assembly.

0 Special Plates To Aid
Blind Constructed
By Zoologists

A set of reproductive plates, to be
used by blind students in zoology
courses, is being prepared by the do-
partment of zoology under the direc-

tion of Dr_ Robert T_ I-Iance, professor

and head of the department.

There will be 25 reproductions, each
on a large black cardboard. Liquid
solder, powdered aluminum, small
aluminum wires and plaster are used
in making them.

The illustrations represent a pro-
gressive picture of the development of
the organism from the typical cell up
the invertebrate, including the
amoeba, paranieciuni, cuglena, sponge,
hydra, planaria, tapeworm and others.

The plates are reproductions of the
ill.I1Si,;‘3.i;lOl1S compiled by George J.
Dambach, graduate assistant in
zoology, in the "Zoology Notebook” by
Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor of
zoology. '

well, and iiisinuations even elicited

triumphed in. “Say there, Jay, how

even he enjoyed the meal. VVe proper-
ly serenaded the Dream Girl, despite
a cracked tenor, and laid her to rest.
Dinner was over, laughter, laughter,

laughter!
After dinner we meandered
from the room, still talking, the

pledges trailing behind. An hour re-
iiiained before time to go to the game;
so the boys smeared themselves
around the house. In a corner of the
living room, four set up a. card table
beneath a yellow—shaded lamp, and

started to “teach you how to D133’

Jack followed me into the living
room and turned on a lamp across the
room. Rose light streaked red on the
polished cups i'esting' “D011 the man‘
tie and red checkers on the tile be-
fore the fireplace_ The music ﬂowed
in ripples, suggesting strange -thoughts
of coniradely things. “Ah, rosa M10

. .” a sturdy voice replaced the vio-
lins for a moment.

I sank into a deep armchair under
the rose lamp, and looked at the boy
reading the paper beside me. “Jack,”
I said. and he lowered the paper-
"'Yeh‘.”’ he answered, and then seeing
I wanted to start a bull session,
dropped the pages in a heap alongside
the chair. “Yell?”

I settled down a little deeper.
“How did you like the freshie dance?”

“Swell!” he exclaimed, a.nd I was
surprised at his vigor_ Jack is one of
those boys who must be in a game
or a jovial mood before he lays his
dignity aside. “Swell!” He snapped
his ﬁngers in rhythm to the tango.
“How did you like it?"

I lay no claim to dignity; “Best
time this year——and I’ve been to every
dance but the niiners’,” I replied with
the same gusto that he had said,
“Swell!” VVe smiled at each other,
thinking pleasant things. Jack
stopped his snapping. “Wonder what
it was. Younger crowd?”

“Lots of things.” Then, in ﬁtful
outbursts, “the freshies’ enthusiasm

saving human life,” he said. “In
many cases ﬂiers have been forced
down on ice cakes or in the interior
of the country. They landed safely
and were ﬁnally rescued. It is only
the open bodies of water in some parts
of the northeast section of the Arctic
where death is the price of a forced
landing.”

“Ice is a great disadvantage if you
want to sail or perliaps swim,” the

explorer commented_ “But it is a
mighty good convenience if you want
to walk.”

Dr. Stefaiisson took part in three
extended explorations of the North the
past 28 years, spent ﬁve solid years
there at one time and wrote seven
books on the country besides learning
the Eskimo language. He spoke ex-
tensively on the future of aviation in
the North.

Shiiting of airlines so that planes
may ﬂy as much as possible in ex-
treme cold was one prophecy the ex-
plorer made.

“Only in temperate climates do we
ﬁnd fog and the danger of ice form-
ing on wings,” he said_ “In the cold,
snow is dry and forms no icy surface
on a ﬂying plane. Far above the sur-
face of the ground it gets as much
as 70 degrees warmer, contrasting
with the increasing cold as planes
climb higher in temperate zones.”

The increased “pay load” a plane in
the north can carry, and of extreme
importance, the extent of landing
facilities on lakes in summer and
frozen ice in winter, increase the ad-
vantages of ﬂying in frigid zones, he
believes.

“In ‘Canada, Alaska and Siberia a.
lake can be found every ﬁve miles,”
the explorer said. “The ground never
thaws, preventing drainage. Thus a
pilot rarely is in trouble when he
must make a forced landing.”

Completing his discussion, the ex-
plorer pointed out that hencefortli—
due to the ease of covering the North
——the United States has not two but
three froiitiers to protect.

“ li—huh!” I nodded and looked

“Did you notice the decorations,

take away at the inteifraternity sing?”
We smiled at each other, and sat
quiet for a long two or three iniiiutes.
Jack yawned and reached for the pa.-
pers. Oii the radio a new program
came on, I awoke with a start and
lleartl a band playing “Over there,”
rapidly, briskly, solidly.

Iabout these remarks that I write this

 but rather to attempt to enlighten my
gcxtremc censors, in the vulgar
‘maneuvers of the Communist Party.
Contempt For Communists

The truth of the niatter is, to phrase
it openly, I have a good deal of con-
tempt for the Communist party as it
functions in America today. It takes
something more than propaganda to
attach to a movement incl’fa.ceable
Stigmata which, I believe, everyone-
even Commuiiists—links up with the
tactics of the Communist party. I-Vhy
is it that so many people’s remarks
are “Oh, those old Communists!”
Strange to say, I have heard this re-
mark from many people who are a
great deal interested in social justice
and who would -be willing to take a
few steps further than soap-box orat-
ing.

I need cite only one act—-—and there
are many more—on the part of the
Anierican C-omniunist party to exem-
plify its technique:
clalist party and a number of trade
unions assembled 20,000 men in Madi-
son Square garden to protest against
the killing of Austrian workers by
Fascists. The meeting, in addition,
was to protest Fascist expansion in
the United States. The Communist
party deliberately burst into this
meeting, and, for no good reason at
all, disrupted it so completely that
the assembly culminated in a most
heart-reiiding riot! VVorker battled
worker; Communist fought against
Socialist No intelligent individual
can support a party which fosters a
vulgar act like this,——an act which
mimics the tactics of Fascists. To
this party can one turn with assur-
ance of leadership in periods of
crises? VVe might forgive this one
crime, were it a. single instance of
ignorance. But it is not so.

Impotence Of Radicals

The Communist party has shown
itself incapable of and unreliable in
coping with the revolutionary situa-
tion. At a time when Fascism is
spreading at an almost irrepressible
pace in Germany, in Austria, in Jugo-
slavia and now in America, the land
of the free; at a time when it is op-
Dortunc to unite workers against this
growing disease; and when it would
be tactful to make some signs of revo-
lutionary leadership, now, in the criti-
cal, momentous depression in which
America ﬁnds herself, the Communist

I know many men among the pro-
fessional groups, doctors and lawyers
especially, with some degree of revo-
lutioiiary proclivity, whose antagon-
ism toward the Communist party of
the United States is grounded on an
act, such as this one, And this dis,-e-

they are wholly sophonioric, and are

, By Raymond E. Pearlman
 E, TOO, TURNED away from me with an acidulous expression-

wliich has recently marked the end of several coiiversaliioiis on
fwhy I remain aloof from revolutionary parties. From time to tiinc
,during our coiiversation, he branded me as a Phariscc, a liypocritc

Party indulges in, and commits not

  

more in keeping with liberal clubs on
the campuses of American colleges.

No wonder it is difficult to approach
professional men on the subject of
revolutionary parties. ‘Hooligan acts,
as I said above, and this is something
I believe worthy of repetition, under-
mine all conﬁdence in parties which
zicclaiiii themselves as t.he leaders of
the new civilization.

What America lacks today is a revo-
lutionary party which can make some
semblance of leadership and intelli-
gent guidance—a party, perhaps,
which should embrace the higher iii-
tellcctual sti'atum_ Deﬁnitely, there
exists no such party in America now.

The newly formed Aineric-a.n \Vork-
ers’ party headed by notables like V.
F. Calverton, Sidney Hook, Arnold
Iolinson and others claims to under-
stand the nature of the revolutionary
change that can save our society from
its coiitinuing and iiicreasiiig disin-
tegration. Nothing has come of this
party; its leaders are suffering from
intellectual menopause.

Iron Grip Of Fascism

Father Coughlin with his 5,000,000
—to be got—wil1 soon be crying that
they alone understand the needed
revolutionary change which will be the
saviour’s cross from the iron—gi'ip of
militant Fascism.

The Socialist party, alas, is to an
ever-increasiiig extent sere and iii-
effectual .

Thus, we see that the situation on
the American front is gloomy. Capi-
talism is trying and will continue to
attempt to save itself at everybody’s

expense. And yet-——and this is the dis-
heartening fa.ct—in the Eastern hori-
zon, we can see no illumination rising
to steer our civilization away from its
inevitable decay,

America needs a new revolutionary
party to which is attached no stigma,
even though false. Intellectual work-
ers of the world, unite!

Panther Cagers
Oppose Wildcat
Quintet Tonight

Northwestern’s Record Shows
Victories Over Strong Carleton
And Marquette Teams

Meeting the ﬁrst of its three
mid-western foes on the annual
“suicide” trip, the Panther bas-
ketball team will attempt to
change the “suicide” part to
“slaughter” when they take to
the floor tonight to tangle with
the strong Northwestern quintet at
Ev-anston.
and his Golden Panther squad ar-
rived in Evanston late this morning.
Plans call for a stay at the Orrington
hotel until time to battle the VVild.-
cats.

Past records show that the mid-
western trip has always been one of
the hardest and usually one of the
most disastrous series of games that
the Panthers face each season, and this
year will prove no exception as to
the difficult games. In the next four
days the Panthers meet three of the
strongest teams in the mid-west,
opening tonight with Northwestern,
battling Iowa at Iowa City tomorrow
night, and ﬁnishing the trip with a
game with Butler at Indianapolis
Monday night. Last year the best
the Panthers could do was to win
one out of three games played, the
lone victory being against North-
western.

In the game with the Wildcats to-
night Dr_ Carlson plans to rely on
the same starting lineup that trounced
Bucknell a week ago. “Skippy”
Hughes and Ted Roderick will start
at the forward posts, Pete Noon
again at center, with Claire Cribbs and
Ross Emrick at the guards.

Frank Loucks, by his ﬁne showing
in the second half of the Bucknell
game, is still very much in the run-
ning for a starting position, but un-
til Dr. Carlson has a chance to see
his present varsity in action against
real opposition, he is content to stand
by the same starting lineup.

Wildcats Are Powerful

The Northwestern team in its two
showings thus far this season has
shown that it again will place a good
team against the Panthers tonight. In
the two games they have played the
VVildcats defeated Marquette, 27-26,
and Vvabash 35-22, Two regulars,
Kowal and Mercer, from last season's
varsity form the nucleus for the
Northwestern varsity. Both are fast,
accurate shooting players. The re-
minder of the VVildcats’ varsity is
made up of Fisher, Vance and Mac-
nelly, the latter two having, been
reserves on last year’s squad.

The probable starting lineup:

Pitt Northwestern
Hughes . . . . . . . . . .F . . . . . . . . . . . Kawal

Meet Iowa Tomorrow
After the game with Northwestern
the Panthers will leave immediately
for Iowa City to meet Iowa tomorrow
night in the second game of the mid-
western trip. Pitt and Iowa have

met three times in basketball since.

1928, but tomorrow night the Hawk-
eyes will still be shooting for their
first victory over the -Golden Pan-
thers.

The Hawkeye varsity promises this
year to be one of the strongest teams
In the mid-west, shown by the fact
that the Iowa varsity decisively
beat Carleton la.st week, 39-22.

Two members of last season’s var-
sit)’, John Barko, forward, and high-
scorer last year, and John Grim, all-
Conference guard, returned this sea-
son, The other three varsity mem-
bers are A1 Bobby, reserve forward
last season, Ivan Blackmer, substitute
center last year, and a soph guard, A1
Buss. The starting lineup has an av-
erage height of six feet, one inch,
matching the height of the Panthers.

One of the features of the game
will be the tip—offs between Pete
Noon, six feet, ﬁve-inch Panther cen-
ter, and Ivan Blackmer, six feet, four-
inch 'Hawkeye center.

 

Faculty Members Spend
Monday Evenings Bowling

While their pupils pore over the as-
signments on Monday evening, the
faculty members are busy counting
their strikes, spares, and misses at
the Strand Bowling Alleys on Forbes
street.

Last Monday, the league got under
way with 13 teachers participating in
the fun. The teams captained by
Dambach and Batchelder respectively
split even in the four matches played.

Next Monday evening at 8 o’clock,
the teaching staff will again gather at
the Strand and hopes to see more of
its members out for an evening of
exercise and pleasant recreation.

Wrestlers Notice

Earl Oster, wrestling coach, is mak-
ing a second call for candidates for
the coming season's varsity and fresh-

Sports Staff Muffs Scoop;
Fails In Hunt For Boy.

lllagazine-Sellers

This might. have been a. good story.
But after all these years of getting
out of the bathtub to go down and
tell the kid pounding on the door that
no magazines were wanted —- the
sports staff couldn’t ﬁnd a magazine
boy Wednesday_

Missing from the above consensus
team is the one compiled by Grant-
land Rice. It ﬁrst appeared today in
Collier’s but that did us no good
yesterday. Someone had an idea
that the little magazine boys get
their copies well in advance of the
sale date and perhaps we could ﬁnd
one

With apples, candies, cakes and
free passes to a local theater, the
sports staff roamed the streets, look-
ing for a kid who had that sa1esman’s
gleam in his eye. But the only sales’
men uncovered were gelling nothing
more than dollar boxes of Christmas
cards, of which the sports staff now

has two boxes.

There were a dozen who could “get
you last week’s” and many others
could supply every other magazine on
the list_ But they couldn’t get that
single magazine.

A lad reported to be selling maga-
zines was ﬁnally located in Clairton.
Instead of holding the kid up to the
phone, his mother did the talking.
But the magazines hadn’t come yet.
It was a spirited conversation, none
the less, and no one will know how
well the phone company made out
until the Panther office gets its bill
next month.

One by one the sports staff strag-
gled in, eating what was left of the
enticing apples, cakes, and candy by
which no one was enticed.

It was then that someone sat down
to punch out a few lines to the effect
that Captain Doc I-Iartwig with seven
votes, gets a place on the consensus

team, regardless. And that is the
most important thing.

Bowling League Frays bl/ith Victories

 

Greek bowlers in League “A” were
in mid—season form at the Center-
Neville alleys Tuesday as the Inter-
fraternity bowling tourney got under
way, Four ﬁne bowlers on the Phi
Delt ﬁve stepped far out in front of
the pack as their consistently high
scores thrice put the Phi Delt score
over the 600 mark.

Pi Lambda Phi was on the receiving
end of this terriﬁc Phi Delt onslaught
led by Baxter, Glassford, Carnahan,
and W'right.

Kappa Sigma, after being buried
deep in the 400’s for the ﬁrst two
matches, came to life and climbed
into the 600’s in the third and ﬁnal
match of play against Phi Gamma
Delta. The Phi Gams still held the
upper hand, however, by virtue of
their clean-cut victories in the ﬁrst
two matches.

Led by Kingsbacher, with a 151 for
second highest individual scoring hon-
ors of" the evening, Phi Epsilon Pi
nosed out a lighting Lambda Chi Alpha
team by a score of two matches to
three. After dropping the ﬁrst match
by -.-I 603-500 margin, Lambda Chi ral-
lied to eke out a four-pin victory in
the second match_ In the ﬁnal match,
however, the Phi Eps registered a
576-551 comeback victory.

Baxter walked off with the indi-
vidual high score of the evening,
smacking the pins down for a 173
total. The third match of the Phi
Delt 3-0 victory was the best team
performance in the ﬁve-man play.
Baxter's 143, Glassford’s 135, Carna-
han’s 146, IVrigl1t's 150, and Prince's
87 totaled the 661 high. This per-
formance was b11t one pin better than
the preceding one when the Phi Delts
scored 660 points_

Tonight at 7 o’clock competition is

again scheduled for six League “A”
