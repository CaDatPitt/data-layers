Keys let
outsiders
access 
Towers

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ“ Writer

Three weeks ago Chris
Schwartz was sitting in a
neighbor's room in Tower B when
two men identifying themselves
as resident assistants stepped into
the room.

But according to RA Emilio
Mazza, these men weren’t RAs.
, “Those two unidentified
individuals were on a floor that
they were not even supposed to
have access to,” Mazza said.
The men used their room keys to
gain access to several ﬂoors in
Tower B.

“They were on girls’ ﬂoors
where they had no business
being. This is what I find to be
really ridiculous,” he said.

The towers operate on a “house
system” in which each resident
can get into the elevator floor

. nearest their room and the ﬂoors

directly above and below the
elevators. .

According to Mazza many
students have keys that will open
several ﬂoors in the towers.

“lSomel people can get into
any floor in the towers,” he said.

This situation has prompted
concern from the Office of
Residence Life, which last year
requested that the locks in the
towers be changed. Mazza said
that Housingtturned down their
request and told them it was, too
expensive.

“Security is an issue with
Housing, and this is a security
problem,” said Amy Ambrosia,
the Resident Student Association
adviser from TowerA. “They want
us to feel secure. We don’t feel
secure; that’s a problem.”

Mazza said, “People pay
enough for housing so that the
girls should have some security.”

Repeated attempts to contact
Housing were unsuccessful.

RSA representatives from
Towers A and B are also trying to
get something done about this
situation. Their most recent
proposal is to change only the
locks on the security doors, not
the rooms. Residents will keep
the same room keys, and they
will be given new keys for the
security doors. ,

The RSA will be sending out a
petition in the towers next week
to ask for this new plan to be
implemented. They are also
considering getting parents
involved.

Cyclist crosses the country for homeless

By “Marietta Pacella
Staﬁ“ Writer

Ronald “Mac” MacDonald has
dedicated his ‘time to riding his
10-speed bicycle across the
country in an attempt to open
people’s minds to the nationwide
homelessness issue.

p “I’ve never done anything like
this before,” he said. “This comes
from the kindness in my heart.
I'm setting an example of love.”

Yesterday MacDonald stopped
at Pitt to promote his cause.

MacDonald’s trip began this
year on June 22 in Los Angeles.
He will soon be reaching his
destination in Newjersey.-T his is
the first time that he has attempted
a trip of this kind.

Before beginning his trip, he

decided to get into the frame of
mind by giving away all of his
belongings.

"1 felt I had to live by faith, l.,.l
like an Apostle,” he said.

However, the one belonging
he didn't sacrifice was his Holy
Bible. He travels with his Bible
opened to Matthew 7:7, a passage
that states: “Ask, and it shall be

ﬁnd; knock, and itshall be opened
unto you.”

MacDonald said, “I believe in
the Bible and have had a lot of
teaching on religion. The higher
powers are around me, and I
expect a greater result because of
that.”

However, MacDonald feels that

IFC warns fraternities
to I watch liabilities

When university housekeeping entered the Sigma Chi House
to investigate a fire alarm malfunction last week, they found
two inches of water on the first floor and one inch on the
second, Interfraternity Council Advisor Bridget Guernsey told
last week's meeting of the IFC.

IFC president Tony Spinola urged fraternity representatives
to warn their brothers about the danger of accidents resulting
from wet floors, and the resulting liabilities.

“In claims against fraternities, l...] injuries that occur from falls
due to slippery floors make up a large portion of suits against
us. Be careful. Take the time to educate your brotherhood,”

Spinola said.

With the end of the rush period, Spinola also reminded
representatives of the broad definition of hazing,

homelessness.

“Churches are closed to the
homeless, but the Bible says to
give to the poor,” he said. ‘

MacDonald was inspired to
begin his “crusade” when he first
saw the brutal treatment the
homeless people of Las Vegas.

“The _Union Pacific sent a
bulldozer through a homeless
camp,‘ destroying the few
possessions [the people] had,” he
said.

“The death of Mitch Snyder la
homeless activist] also convinced
me that this was what I should be
doing. When I saw his death in
southern California, I knew what
I had to do. I had to take his place
and keep his example going,” he
said.

He has stayed at homeless

shelters throughout the country
during his extensive trip.

“There are a lot of shelters, but
what these people need is
counseling and low-income
housing so they can be self-
supportive when they leave the
shelters. A person feels
dehumanized in theshelters. The
people are housed worse than
the army and worse than the
criminals in jails,” he said.

According to MacDonald, the
food in the shelters does nothave
good nutritional value.

“The food is loaded with
carbohydrates. Nothing else.
That’s understandable for a
person who works out a lot, but

"it’s not healthy for them. They

Instrument collection
shown after fouryears

By Tammy Poole
Staff Writer

A collection of musical
instruments from around the
world was on display in Hillman
Library last month for the first
time after four years of storage in
the University of Pittsburgh
warehouse.

Sylvia Cunningham, a 1970 Pitt
graduate, donated the 300-piece
collection to the University of
Pittsburgh in 1986.

Cunningham said most of the
instruments in the collection were
purchased at antique shops within
the United States. Others, she
said, were given to her by family
and friends.

Cunningham, a Pittsburgh
native, said she collected the
various instruments because of
her love for music and desire to
have a museum.

When the collection became
too large for her home,
Cunningham decided to donate
the instruments to the university.

“I’ve always hoped it would be
on display so students could see
the collection,” she said. “Maybe
through this exhibit, students will
gain more of a culture
background.”

Through Cunningham’s travels,
some of which include Eastern
Europe, a place she considers to
be her “old world charm,” she

Shoplifting on the rise for Oakland businesses

By Aimee Wolﬁnger
Staﬂ“ Writer

With the return of students to
Oakland in the fall, many local
shops become victims of
increased shoplifting.

“Shoplifting is universal,” said
Rich Forsythe, manager of The
Essex. “It is a problem all retailers
must contend with.”

According to Forsythe,
shoplifting increases when
students return. to school and
around the Christmas season.
“There is an increase when we
are busier which is because of
high traffic,” he said.

In order to reduce shoplifting,
The Essex has a baggage check at
all entrance points and prosecutes
shoplifters. “We train our staff to
be aware of what is going on
around them,” said Forsythe. “Plus
we have specific prevention
methods.”

Products that are frequently
shoplifted have been eliminated,
said Forsythe.

At Oasis Music and Video,

shoplifting is a year—round
problem, according to manager
Ray Schlachter. But he said the
problem grows when students
return to school. “We have an all
year problem, but it seems to
worsen when the students are
back [in Oakland]. In the summer
we have a lull,” said Schlachter.

A police officer is in the store
every night to prevent theft, and
a security system will soon be
installed. Oasis- looked into
acquiring a lift system similar to
the one atjukes in Station Square,
but Schlachter said it was too
expensive.

Shoplifters rip open compact
disc and cassette packages and
just steal the disc or tape,
according to Schlachter. “We find
empty boxes in the back of our
store,” he said. “Sometimes one
person will come in and set [the
merchandise they want to steal]
up in the back, and then later
someone else comes in and takes
it out.” _

Rap music and pop/rock are
the biggest target for shoplifters,

said Schlachter. “With the rap
music we keep the CD or tape
behind the counter and put the
empty boxes on display. If you
want to buy the tape or CD we
give them to you at the counter,”
he said. “Singles are also a hot
item for shoplifters because they
are so small.”

Because of the lift system used
at Jukes, they have a theft rate of
zero, said assistant manager Jim
Edgar.

“All the CD5 come into the
store in shrink rap, and then we
take them out and store them
behind the counter. We display
the package and if you want a
selection we fill it at the counter,”
said Edgar.

According to Edgar, the only
theft is a result of young kids who
steal inserts from the CD package,
but they are usually apprehended.

Avalon Vintage Clothing
experienced an
shoplifting in late spring, said
assistant manager Donna Berardi.

‘‘It may have been because we
started carrying more new clothes.

increase in .

The majority of the clothes that
were missing were new, therefore
we especially watch those items,”
Berardi said.

As a result of the theft increase,
Avalon now monitors the dressing
rooms. “We started a number
system,” said Berardi. “It seemed
that girls were wearing long skirts
and putting clothes on under
them.”

T 0 further deter possible theft
all patrons must check their bags.
“Backpacks are a possible vehicle

for shoplifting,” Berardi said. “If

we see someone who looks
suspicious, we ask them if they
need help. That often stops
possible shoplifters.”

Thrift Drug loses a lot of

merchandise to shoplifters,
according to assistant manager
Rich Drozol. Although he said it
is a year-round problem, crowds
seem to draw more prospective
shoplifters. “When the store is
really crowded shoplifters are less
afraid to come in,” he said.

A security guard is in Thrift

said thatshe has gained a broader

understanding of her culture and
important knowledge of her roots.

“I have a long history of
musicians in my family,” said
Cunningham.

She mentioned that her two
sons, Stephen and Thomas, also
Pitt alumni, play instruments such
as the guitar, violin, bass and
viola.

“In 1973, my family and I were
voted America’s Musical Family
of the Year by the American
Music Conference. We’re very
active in the community,” said
Cunningham.

When asked how she felt when
Christine Zarnich, administrator
of the music department, asked
permission to put her collection
on display, Cunningham said, “It
was very nice. I thought it was
very, very nice.”

Zarnich said she first heard of
Cunningham’s collection from co-
workers six months ago when
she became administrator for the
department and manager of the
music building.

“Although I had only heard
about the instruments, I had never
seen them,” she said.

“I felt that after three or so
years, it would be nice to do
something with the collection,”
Zarnich said.

Zarnich went to the warehouse
and spent three days cleaning the
instruments in order to get them
ready for display.

“I chose the particular 48
instruments to use at the art gallery
because of presentability. That
doesn’t mean that there aren’t
many other ones at the warehouse
that wouldn’t be presentable for

show, it’s just that these were the '

ones that caught my eye,” she
said.

The collection was on exhibit
at the William Pitt Union art
gallery from Sept. 17 to 24.

Nicole Vitale, arts director for
the Pitt Program Council, was in
charge of arranging the exhibit
once it arrived for display.‘

“They are very nice pieces,”
she said, “and I’m glad that the
school gets to keep them.”

When the union exhibit closed,
the instruments were placed back
in storage at the warehouse.

Professor Don Franklin,
chairperson of the music
department, said when

Cunningham donated the
collection, there was the idea to
display the instruments in the
Bellefield Annex lobby.

“Since itwasn’t quite clear what
the university was going to do
with the building, and the
administration of the building
changed, the context to display
the exhibit got lost,” said Franklin.

“We are still looking for a
permanent place for the
collection,” he said.

Franklin noted that, in the
future, he hopes to use the
instruments for performances and
student instructional purposes.

doing something. This is our main
priority,” Ira Horowitz, Tower B
RSA president, said.

Besides the security problem,
residents are also worried about
vandalism. Since students have
access to floors they aren’t
supposed to get into, the residents
on that floor have to pay for any
damagethey do. During the first

week of school, seven light covers
on the 12th floor of Tower B
were broken by a group from
another ﬂoor. Because nobody
actually saw them do it, the 12th
floor is responsible for about $280
in damages. Mazza said that he
has had to escort people off of
the 12th floor.

“Them being here leaves the
risk of vandalism,” Mazza said.

Americans need to learn more about the
Vietnamese people before they can understand
the Vietnam War, according to David M. Berman,
Ph.D., assistant professor in the School of
Education.

“The textbooks in secondary education contain
little, if any information about the Vietnamese
culture, history or life,’’ Berman said at a lecture
entitled Vietnam Revisited yesterday.

Berman recently participated in a program
called the U.S./Indo-China Reconciliation Project,
where educators from the United States went to
Vietnam to learn of its people and the effects the
Vietnam War had upon them.

He said the people of Northern Vietnam are
still loyal to their government, whereas in the
south, people are more open-minded and critical
of their government. The government of Vietnam

recently pulled out of Cambodia and the.

relationship between the United States and
Vietnam is growing friendlier, he said.

Berman encouraged this type of relationship
and said that he hopes the University of Pittsbu rgh
would form ties with the‘Vietnamese government
like it did the Chinese. He felt that the university

Education key to Vietnam War

could greatly be enriched by this exchange.

This was the third time that Berman had
returned to Vietnam. He served in the Vietnam
War from 1968 to 1969 in the central highland,
dealing with the war refugees, or as he called
them “flotsam” and “jetsam.” He also participated
in the reconciliation project in 1986.

Before his trip, Berman wanted to talk to some .

of the Vietnamese veterans from the Vietnam
War. During his trip, most ofhis interviews were
cancelled because the government was weary of
CIA agents that may have entered the country.

Berman said that he not only learned that
every village was affected by the Vietnam War
but every family as well.

One veteran said that he had only one aunt
and four uncles remaining. In the war, he lost 17
brothers and cousins.

Berman recalled the time when his town’s
veterans had to raise their own funds to build a
monument honoring the five U.S. soldiers from
the county who died in the Vietnam War.

Berman’s biggest surprises were the
monuments the Vietnamese dedicated to the
war dead in each of the tiny‘ villages. On top of
the monuments read, “The fatherland remembers
the sacrifice of the fatherland,” or “T he fatherland
remembers the dead of each fallen hero.”

and nothing that is truly healthy

is supplied for them.”

“These people need to be
treated similar to the treatment of
a small child. They have never
been taught the self-assured ‘go-
_for-it’ attitude. They need support,
an ego-boost, love, appreciation
and most of all a friend,” he said.

According to MacDonald,
people who declare their lack of
sympathy for the homeless simply
do not understand these peoples’
situations. .

“You don’t know what the
homeless went through. You
don’t know their backgrounds
until you talk to them for yourself,”
he said.

As his journey for awareness
winds down, he will be visiting
other colleges in an attempt to
open students’ minds to the issue.

“Psychology students could
study [the homeless]. There is so
much they could [earn from [such
a studyI,” he said.

The main problem, according
to MacDonald, is the fact that

people in the community are too

afraid to reach out to strangers.

“The thing is, we have just as
many criminals as good people.
A man on the street with nice
clothes could be just as likely to

be a murderer as someone with
torn and tattered clothing,” he
said.

MacDonald said that many
people have helped him during
the trip.

“I have had very good
experiences [during the trip]. I’ve
seen people all over the United
States turn around by giving a
little bit of love. Americans have
a lot of faith, kindness, good will.
[However], leadership is lacking.
A reform is due in the
government,” he said.

In St. Louis, Mo., a group of

_ men stole a towel from his bicycle.

MacDonald said people who read
about this theft in the paper and
saw [MacDonald’s] picture in the
papers, learned about what he
was doing, and read about the
theft. The next day, 30 people
were watching over his bicycle
for him.

MacDonald’s most memorable
experience was in a park with a
young girl and her child.

“I saw a girl with her child in a
park one day, and she asked how
I felt about women’s issues. I told
her I supported‘ their equality.
She then told me about her life.
She was sexually abused as a
child by her father. She ran away

Campus Store, said that most
shoplifters steal anything they
can get a handful of or the most
expensive products. “Shoplifters

know what costs the most, and
that is what they go for,” said
Sabol

Sabol said it is often easy to
pick out potential shoplifters by
their clothing and attitude. “When
someone walks in with an ‘I’m
bad attitude and just try to mess
with me’, you know to keep your
eye on them,” he said.

“When four people come in
and Mr. Friendly is at the counter
asking questions to keep your
attention, you just about know
the other three are stuffing their
bags and coats with sweatshirts,”
said Sabol.

He also said that the people
trying to rob a store often do not
feel that theyare in the wrong.
“When we "ea'tch— s’ome'7o‘rré, they
expect us to take back the product
and not prosecute,” said Sabol.
“Their mentality is that you got
your product back, so what’s the
big deal.”

What angers Sabol the most is
when shoplifters steal an entire
style of a specific item and then
sell the items for less than retail
cost.

Tower B needs new locles. ..

In a big city,‘ crime is a constant problem which
cannot completely be stopped. It is not uncommon,
therefore, for students attending the University of
Pittsburgh to take measures to prevent this crime. It
does not help their effort that they cannot be assured

 of the security of the building in which they live.

This is a problem over which students living in Tower
B have no control. There are people who have keys
that unlock security doors in Tower B. These people
live not only in Tower B but in other dormitories.

Wlgen the probleqighabs beenraddressed,  housing 5;
department informed the resident assistants thatlock
changes would be too expensive. . _ . I

5 Along with their guarantee for on-campus housing, L
the university is promising a secure. livingarea. But this
promise cannot be adhered to unless the housing
department changes the locks on the doors. This
problem has become a security hazard to all who live
in the towers.

Right now, the major problems that Tower B students
must deal with are theft and vandalism. But the
Oakland-Shadyside area is currently dealing with a

‘ ninja—style attacker and has recently encountered a

""‘ serial rapist. These multi-access keys are not only
causing students to worry about their possessions, but
their safety as well.

Only at ‘token ’ gesture. ..

The city of Pittsburgh finally took a step yesterday
toward curtailing smoking among minors.

City Council, after a debate that lasted for months,
passed a bill that will change all vending machines which
sell cigarettes and other tobacco products from accepting
coins to tokens. Various amendments, such as security
measures to stop people from breaking into the machines,
were revoked by council.

These tokens will be available to the public at a place
in the establishment with the machine. Before selling
,_ these tokens,the establishment will have to check for ID

if the person looks to be under 18.

This bill shows that the city is at least attempting to
educate the minors of Pittsburgh that smoking is wrong
and that they should never get started.

While this is a step in the right direction, it is not enough.
The city needs to educate minors about the hazards of
“smoking. Though keeping the cigarettes from them helps
their cause, they will still want to experiment unless they
know that cigarettes can eventually kill them.

Around the world, one woman
dies every three minutes from a
self-induced abortion. This is
according to‘ Molly Yard,
president of the National
Organization for Women. Yard
spoke to a crowd of over 150
people last Thursday evening
about the issues concerning the

 'nda,_mental»~ right to privacy,
‘ wh'ich includes abortion and the

problems young, poor and rural
wojmenhave in gaining access to

. ‘abortion ;ser_vices_ and birth

control counseling.

In this country, laws have been
passed in Indiana, Michigan and
other states that require a minor
to have the consent of her
parent(s) before she may have
an abortion.

In the video Abortion Denied-

Young Lives Shattered, parents,
friends, spouses and other family
members reminisce about the
women in their lives, who for
reasons of tough parental-
consent laws, laws prohibiting
abortion or inaccessibility to
abortion clinics, self—aborted and
died.

Think about that for a moment
—— pregnant women are killing
themselves rather than bearing
unwanted children. It's a chilling
thought, isn’t it’ Women shouldn’t
have to die trying to control their
reproductive organs. More
information on how to find birth
control and other options to
pregnancy areneeded. Abortion
is still legal, despite the efforts of
the “pro—life” (a misnomer if I've
ever heard one) movement, and,
for now, I can still write and talk
about information concerning

access to one.

If a woman suspects that she is
pregnant, then she ought to see
her family doctor or a
gynecologist immediately. Be
warned: according to Molly Yard,
legislation recently passed in
Pennsylvania that allows a doctor

the legal right to withhold
information about .a woman’s
health or pregnancy that may
cause her to seek an abortion.
If that is the case with your
doctor, than look up “abortion”
in the yellow pages; there will be
a listing of services and agencies
that provide birth—control

; counseling. In choosing a clinic,

make sure it says in the ad
“abortion services;” otherwise
you’ll get a pro—life clinic, where

 

Lisa
Oshop

they perform home pregnancy
tests and will only inform you
about adoption or parenting
options.

There are both profit and non-
proﬁt abortion clinics. Non—profit
clinics will list this status in their
ad. In terms of the quality of
health care, there is no difference
between the two. Both offer
reduced rates for women on
Medicaid, but only non-profit
clinics will never turn a woman
away from an abortion if she
cannot afford one. Far from being
the big- business industry that
the pro-life movement portrays
abortion to be, non—proﬁt abortion
clinics sacrifice $800 a day to
ensure that no woman who asks
for an abortion is turned down.

Also in the ad is a toll—free
number. A woman may call if she

  Make sure abortion is safe

wants to talk to a counselor about
her pregnancy. If she wishes, she
may schedule a .pre—abortion,
problem-pregnancy counseling-
session '
at Women’s Health Services.
During this counseling session
a woman is counseled on all
options, according to Mary

Litman, the marketing and}?

information coordinator
Women’s Health Services.

“The woman has to make her '
own decision,” she added. “That”.
decision includes informed
consent on adoption, abortion or '
parenthood." V

After the woman's counseling
session, she sees a patient
educator who talks to her to
ascertain that the woman is not
ambivalent and has not been
coerced into having an abortion.
If the woman is certain about her
decision, she may schedule an
appointment to have the abortion
that day.

When a woman goes in for her
abortion, no matter what clinic
she chooses, the staff will test her
for pregnancy and will examine
her before the procedure. Three
weeks after the abortion, the
woman should be examined to
make sure that no complications
or problems have arisen. These
follow—up tests are free of charge,
regardless of whether the
procedure was performed at a
proﬁt or non-profit institution.

Though I sincerely hope that
no woman reading this column
ever needs to have an abortion,
realistically many of you at some
time in your life will have one.
Let’s hope that, should this occur,
the abortion is a safe and legal
one. Let’s hope that at least one
woman’s life is saved because
she knew where to go for help
with an unwanted pregnancy.

Sept. 25 —— A student locked
his Cannondale mountain bike to
the aluminum railing on the
patio in front of the Chevron
Building. When he returned, his
bicycle had been removed by an
unknown person(s). A campus
police officer informed the student
that the aluminum rail is not a
secure nor permissible place to
lock his bicycle.

police of two males who were
attempting to steal two bicycles
from the area around the Chevron
Building. The student told the
officer that the actors fled up
Parman Street. The officer and
student observed a male at
Schenley High School who had a
bicycle that he claimed he found.
Since he could not open the lock
of the bicycle, it was confiscated.

Sept. 26 Two officers
observed an intoxicated man on
the corner of Fifth Avenue and

I don’t believe that Bullet
Lavolta playing Pittsburgh three
times in one year is a mere
coincidence. Either the people
here really dig the band, or the
band really grooves on
PitLsburgh’s hip club scene. (l’m
being sarcastic, of course!)

At the very least, give Lavolta
credit for such a hardworking
attitude. They’ve been on tour for
what seems like an eternity in
support oftheir 1989 debut album
The Gift on Taangl Records. And
not surprisingly, no one has gotten
tired of it yet.

Bullet LaVolta churns out a
viscous mixture of hybrid rock
with the urgency of bygone punk
and the spastic energy of ’70s
rock circa AC/ DC and the Stooges.

Vocalist Yukki Gipe sets this
cataclysmic quintet in motion,

OF YOUR CHOICE?

Bullet LaVolta rocks Pittsburgh a third time

flailing his long hair and half-
naked body about the stage like
a possessed mongrel. Bill Whelan
(bass), Todd Philips (drums), Ken
Chambers (guitar) and Clay Tarver
(guitar) are the main vertabrae in
the backbone of this humanoid
music machine.

For someone who doesn’t eat
meat, Gipe really knows how to
convey a carnivorous attitude.
His pulsing testosterone and thirst
for blood must be instinctual. His
name, by the way, is his own
creation. He chose Yukki for the
obvious pleasant images it
conjures and Gipe from a
tombstone in a graveyard he used
to hang out in.

Boston has always had the
reputation as being a very “artsy,”
borderline~wimpy town, a
reputation that has been
overturned with the likes ofGang
Green and most recently Bullet
LaVolta.

LaVolta offers a raw, pleasing
show, not to mention momentary
loss of hearing. They’re loud and
fast, but most importantly, they’re
succinct and musically together,

qualities that most other
neo-thrash bands fail, to even
acknowledge.

Be the first kid on your block to
see Bullet Lavolta three times.
They’Il rip your face off!

Bullet La Volta will be
performing at the Upstage Lounge
this Sunday, Sept. 30 for an all-
ages sbow starting at 730 pm.
Opening bands include locals Ylae
Kelly Affair and DC. ’5 jawbox,
which includes former members
of Government Issue.

Head Husker Mould returns

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Since leaving Husker Du in

_ 1987 amidst whirling accusations

and rumors, Bob Mould has
become a virtual one-man band;
singer, songwriter, guitarist,
producer.

The suicide of their manager
David Savoy in late 1987, an
artistic power struggle between
Mould and Grant Hart and Hart’s
ever deepening obsession with
heroine would become the major
reasons for the band’s demise.

The parting was anything but
amiable, both members blaming
the other in print. The power
struggle turned into a competition
of sorts, with Mould and Hart"in
a race for dominance in their solo
careers.

Mould’s A first solo release,
Workbook, on Virgin Records, sent
him straight to the top with the

critics. Mould was finally free
from the constraints of Husker
Du, and it showed in the diverse,
almost pensive tunes on
Workbook.

Black Sheets of Rain came as a
response to audience reactions
of his Workbook tour. Their
exhilarating approval pushed
Mould to be a bit more raucous
with this album.

While Workbookcapitalized on
Mould’s tortured, passionate past,
Black Sheets of Rain mimics a
very now attitude. lts songs are
more fast paced, yet no more
urgent in their message than
previous tunes.

Teaming up with drummer
Anton Fier of the Golden
Palaminos and bassist Tony
Maimone of Pere Ubu, Mould is
able to convey powerful ideas in

melodious terms, unlike the
naked aggression that Husker Du
emphasized.

Mould has gotten over the initial
insecurities of his solo career and
first album. His steadfast
determination and self confidence
in his musical abilities are obvious
on Black Sheets 0/‘Rain. He seems
more comfortable with the
success he has achieved so far.

The only obstacle in Mould’s
way is the decision to shoot for
mainstream success or remain an
underground celebrity, especially
in light of the fact that album-
oriented—rock stations are starting
to take notice of Mould’s work.

Bob Mould will be performing
an all—ages show along with Ultra

Dos and Don'ts while enjoying CMU's A Chorus Line

By Jenna Ferrara
Slaﬂ‘ Writer

“One... singular sensation...
every little step she takes..." I’ve
seen the show on Broadway; I’ve
listened to the soundtrack
regularly since I was I 1, and I 
left Carnegie Mellon University’s
Kresge Theatre with “One,” the
closing number to A Chorus Line,
ringing in my headas if it was the

first time I’d ever heard it. Small
wonder that after a 15-year run A
Chorus Line closed in April 1990
as the longest running musical in
Broadway history. A
Conceived by Michael Bennett
with a lot of gegy unrecognized
help from other dancers, A
Chorus Line chronicles the joys
and struggles of dancers
auditioning for a Broadway
chorus line. “This show is

 

dedicated to anyone who has
ever danced in a ChOl'LlS or
marched in step — anywhere,”
according to the program notes.
Ironic, that, because Bennett’s
inspirations for the most
successful musical ever basically
bared their souls for a pittance.
The play evolved through a series
of workshops in which a group
of Broadway dancers told Bennett
their life stories in taped sessions.
These sessions became A Chorus

dancing. DeLuca was directed
by Bennett in the national
company ofA Chorus Line and
also appeared on Broadway in
The Mystery of Edwin Drood
and Bob Fosse’s Domain’.

The show opens with dancers
(some good, some appropriately
atrocious) vying for a part in
director Zack’s Broadway
musical. He calls several of the
aspirants back for a second look
but is not satisﬁed to review

emotionally charged celebration
of the dance mingled with the
revelation of the pain behind the
polished movements.

The confusion and wonderment
of adolescence is explored in a
montage “Hello, Twelve, Hello
Thirteen.” In “At the Ballet,” three
female dancers tell of the difficult
childhooids that motivated their
escape into dance.

The company is effective at
showing both the bonding and the
hostilities that erupt during such a
long, rigorous series of auditions.

Mark Brettschneider as Zack is
at turns commanding, tough and
vulnerable. I ’d never pictured Zack
with a blond pigtail, but it certainly
works. I

Nastascia Diaz (Cassie) sings
“The Music and the Mirror” with
intensity, artfully balancing her
plea for a role in her ex-lover
Zack’s show with an expression
for her sheer love of dance.

Natalie V. Belcon is sexuality
incarnate as Sheila, whose bitchy
comments and toughness are at

turns both funny and pathetic,

Tami Tappan is a passionate,
riveting Diana, explaining earnestly
“What I Did For Love” of dancing.
Lovely, powerful singing and acting
distinguish Sherry Boone (Maggie).

Chorus

Continued from page S-4

As Bobby, Jack Plotnick is
engagingly bizarre, showing great
delight in recounting stories of
his twisted youth. Ty Taylor, who
has the widest grin l’ve seen on
the stage in a long time, is
ironically very riveting as the
tortured Paul.

In “Sing,” Greg Stuhr (Al) and
Ashley Cruz (Kristine) are funny
as a husband/wife team, although
Cruz’s portrayal of Kristine’s
inability to sing is screechingly
overdone a bit.

W. Ellis Porter (Richie) is, so
wonderfully exuberant in “Hello
Twelve, Hello Thirteen,” that he
literally almost bounces off the
stage.

I enjoyed the professionalism
of CMU theatre immensely. The
sound, lighting and set design
accented the emotional peaks of
the show, and where they found
so many theater students who
can sing, act and dance, I’ll never

 
 

know.

Regardless of how good a

a lot to “ruin it for the rest of

Showcase Editor

NEW YORK—The New York
Film Festival has always
celebrated the cutting edge of
cinema. This year is no exception.
which began
previewing Sept. 18 and runs
through Oct. 4, is screening 27
programs of shorts and features
from around the world.

The festival’s lineup was
amazingly diverse, featuring ultra-
violent thrillers, tragic slices-of-
lifefrom Siberia, China and East
Africa, funny cartoons, surreal
shorts and even an experimental
narrative on menopause!

Located at the Lincoln Center
for the Arts in mid—town
Manhattan, the festival is run by
the New York Film Society, a
privately funded group which
promotes the cinematic arts and
supports new filmmakers.

Though screenings are playing
to the usual sellout crowds, the
film society expects to lose
$300,000 on this year’s festival.

The society’s dedication to art
is a stark contrast to the
commercial-oriented climate of
most American cinema. When
the New York Film Festival was
founded 28 years ago, this country
had a thriving “art-house” movie

scene which supported directors

like Jean-Luc Godard, Francois
Truffaut and Bernardo Bertolucci.

In the wake ofl.ucas, Spielberg
and the ’80s, the prospects for
non—mainstream films have

dwindled. Next to those pretty
women and ninja turtles, most of
the movies shown at the festival
have a slim chance of success.
Still, there have been plenty of
success stories. The festival is a
golden opportunity for unknown
filmmakers. Michael Moore’s
Roger & Me and Pedro
Almodovar’s Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown are two
recent examples of festival entries
that have reached bigger
audiences. ,
Film festivals in Cannes, Berlin

. and Toronto are enormous events,

where filmmakers, stars and
studio execs come to schmooze
and strike deals. The New York
Film Festival, on the other hand,
is smaller and emphasizes
selectivity.

The festival is a scene for
celebrities, New York high
society, the press and camera-
snapping paparazzi. It is also a
place where distributors and
theater owners go shopping for
movies. Above all, it is a ﬁlm
buffs heaven.

What follows are some
highlights of the screenings and
press conferences during my
week at the festival. A few of
these movies -— Miller’s Crossing
and King of New Yorle will
definitely play a theater near you.
The others will probably,
hopefully, come to Pittsburgh
within the nextyear via the Fulton,
Playhouse, Carnegie Museum or
video.

Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney in the Coen Brothers‘ gangster pic Miller's Crossing.

First shown was the Joel and

Ethan Coen’s eagerly anticipated A

third ﬁlm, Miller’s Crossing. Set in
an unnamed big city of the 19303,
the ﬁlm concerns a gang war
between Leo, an aging Irish—mob
boss (Albert Finney), a rival Italian
(Ion Polito) and their cynical,
clever intermediary (Gabriel
Byrne). The directors have gone
to great pains to create a pulpy,
neo-gangster film ambience. Call

Miller's Crossing has stunning
effects and the trademark Coen
dialogue, (“You wanna kill him?”
one gangster asks. “For starters,”
the other answers.), yet it’s
emotionally empty. There’s none
of the fun, redemptive kitsch of
Raising Arizona. This time, the

ending. They fall short because

the characters are the same old

At their press conference, the
writer/directors spoke earnestly
about Dashiell Hammett and their
duty to the “gangster genre.” It
became clear that, like Blood
Simple, Miller’s Crossing is a film
about other ﬁlms. It’s easy to see
why one Village Voice critic

Festival

Continued from page 5-6
in The Freshman where NYU
film—school geeks diligently
analyze The Godfather II.

Far more controversial was The
King ofNew York, a manic drug
thriller by New York—based
filmmakers Abel Ferrara and
Nicholas St. john. Christopher
Walken plays a superhuman,
coke—dealing Robin Hood. He
and his racially integrated crew
(led by a psycho B—Boy played
by Larry Fishburne) wreak havoc
on Manhattan, murdering cops,
Mafioso and Colombians, then
donating proceeds to poor
hospitals and housing projects;

Amidst all the guns, dope and
fuckin’ in the streets, King ofNew
York gives a startling glimpse at
the social, racial and economic
tensions tearing the Apple apart
in 1990.

The film provoked furious
reactions from the crowd. “Why
did you make this?” someone
asked the ﬁlmmakers. Others
complained about the drugs and
the violence. Some told them
their ﬁlm was “empty.” Some
criticisms were downright
ridiculous. “Wouldn’tit have been
a better ﬁlm ifyou had used more
classical music and less rap
music?” one man said,
commenting on the Vivaldi and
Schooly D soundtrack.

The King of New York had its
fair share of outspoken admirers
as well. An enthusiastic writer
from the Pittsburgh Courier

proclaimed the movie “American
as apple pie. Violence is accepted
in this culture unless it’s political
. If that had been John Wayne
with a flag no one would have
complained about it. 

The man had a point. The
same crowd that complained
about King of New York had
applauded the equally violent
Millers Crossing. Seems a violent
film set in some mythological
gangland is a bit less threatening
than one set on the streets outside
the theater. It reminded me of the
furor over Do the Right Thing at
Cannes. Nothing like a movie
about the real world to scare the
socks off of aesthetes.

From the Soviet Union came
Freeze-Die-Come—to—Life, a
flawed, beautiful film about two
child delinquents in a Siberian
town bordering a gulag.

The film is set in bleak years
following World War II, but
director Vitaly Kanevski said, “I
am depicting the past, but also
the present reality. A lot of this
has remained."

‘‘If it weren’t for perestroika, I
wouldn’t have shot this,”
Kanevski said. But he also
explained that the Soviet Union’s
economic problems are nearly as
crippling as the old censorship
problems. “We have no ﬁlm stock,
no equipment. That’s why I am
looking for foreign collaborators.”

The most interesting revelation
of Kanevski’s press conference
came near the end when he

Dope fiends in The King of New York.

mentioned casually that he had
been in prison. When asked about
this, he initially replied: “I’ve done
quite a few bad things in my life
— I probably deserved it.” After
pausing, Kanevski continued:
“Actually, it all started when I
wrote this script. 

The director then told how his
idea for Freeze-Die—Come— Tolioe,
which involves the children of
gulag prisoners, had shocked
fellow students and teachers at
the film school he attended.
Shortly afterwards, Kanevski says
he was arrested on charges of
rape. While in prison Kanevski

discovered that the arresting
officer never signed the papers
charging him. The woman whom
he “raped” was forced to write
denunciations of him and did so
under protest. While in prison,
the woman attempted to get him
pardoned. Sounds like Kanevski
has material for his next film. 

American writer/director
Yvonne Rainer has created what
must be the first feature-length
fiction on menopause. Privilege
centers on the recollections of a
middle—aged dancer who
confesses, “The biggest problem
with hitting middle age was

SI|BWAY’S

Pitt News File Photo

realizing that how I looked was
the lynch pin of my identity.”

Her account is interrupted by
interviews with women, facts"
about menopause, and sexual
politics and old health movies.
Privilege is occasionally preachy,
but always unpredictable and
fascinating.

“What I am attempting to do,”
Rainer said, “is cast questions on
how the position of women in

‘society rests on how they age

differently.  All women have a

different point of view [about

menopause]. Some feel freer;

When I first saw Fantasia, I
was all ofsix years old and scared
to death. Those horrendous
dancing hippos and the devil
conducting an orchestra of
demons literally made me cry at
night. (I thought the devil was
under my bed.)

Now, with my fear of the devil
quite subsided, Walt Disney
Pictures has again brought
Fantasia out of its vaults to
frighten another set of six—year-
olds, this time with new_sound
and color restoration.

Celebrating its 50th anniversary,
Fantasia is hitting the screen in a
restored version which was struck
from its rejuvenated original
negative. A

Leopold Stokowski and the
Philadelphia Orchestra worked
with Terry Porter to bring the
soundtrack up to a new standard
of excellence, while YCM Labs
re—colored the film.

people who attended the film in
the ’60s would drop acid and
then trip out on the visuals.
Animator Ollie Johnston says he
was straight when he worked on
the movie. (Johnston was
responsible for drawing the
female centaurs in the Pastorale
scene.)

Fantasia has heard its share of
fundamentalist grumblings over
the years because of its overt
occult themes. The scenes with
the devil, the sorcerer (Mickey
Mouse played his apprentice) and
the Pan figures that play the pipes
in the Petrarchan settings have all
been under fire for glorifying a
pagan theme.

This film, which won two
special Academy Awards, will be
released on Oct. 5 across the

SOUNDINGS

I an ear for the finer things in life

 

Prince
Graffiti Bridge
Pasley Park

Prince’s latest, Graﬂiti Bridge,
the soundtrack for the upcoming
movie of the same name, is a
double album that’s all over the
place musically yet manages to
keep a consistent level of quality
and lyrical maturity throughout.

Aside from 10 new solo Prince
songs, the album features four
songs by the newly reformed
Time and guest vocals by George
Clinton, Mavis Staples and Tevin
Campbell on three others. It is a
fine return to form after last year’s
disappointing (but commercially
successful) Batman soundtrack.

The album begins with “Can’t
Stop This Feeling I Got,” one of
its many highlights, The upbeat,
guitar—based song has Prince
singing excitedly, “Only we can
change the world.” And from
what follows, you could almost
believe that he may do just that.

“New Power Generation” kicks
in next, offering some unusually
harsh lyrics. “We’re sick and tired
of you telling us what to do” and
“I hope they bury your old ideas
the same time they bury you” are
not things one would expect to
hear coming out of Prince’s
mouth. But he does have a habit
of giving his fans what they least

expect. “Growing Old” even has halfthe ALL CORDMLLY INVITED‘ , .‘,,...«

steamy vocals with a truly soulful
guitar solo, perhaps one of his
best yet. “Tick Tick Bang,”
featuring layers of instrumentation
over a furious beat, is the catchiest
thing this side of “Kiss.”
The album isn’t without faults,
though. “Thieves in the Temple”
(the current single) is a little on
the boring side, and the ballad
“Still Would Stand All Time” is
downright tedious.
All in all, however, the good far
outweighs the bad, making

A conversation with Pitt novelist Reginald McKnight

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Reginald McKnight claims to be

challenged and affected by the

 

literary submissions of his Intro

For someone who has, herself,
taken Intro to Fiction, this
statement is somehow hard to
swallow —— especially coming

stories, Moustapba 3 Eclipse, and
has since published his first novel,
I Get on the Bus.

Who are your favorite
authors and who do you feel
heavily inﬂuences your
writing?

Just about everybody, from
comic books to Proust, but I’d
say some of my favorites are John
Edgar Wideman and Tony
Morrison, John Williams —-— not
the john Williams who wrote The
Man W190 Cried I Am, but the
john Williams who wrote Stoner.
There are two different john
Williams, one’s black, one’s white.
The white guy, I think, is the one
I’m talking about. There are so
many. It’ll probably sound sort of
insincere to the readers, since
MargaretAtwood chose my stories
for the Heinz Prize, but before
this happened, Margaret Atwood
was an inﬂuence on my work.

When you have a student
who has been published or, in
your opinion, has the
potential to be published, do
you feel compelled to spend
additional time working With
him or her?

Usually if someone is a good
enough writer I try to do all I can
to stay out of his or her way. The
way I look at it, you really can’t
teach anyone to write. If
somebody comes to you with
that much talent, what you want
to do is interfere with it as [little]
as possible. You teach a few of
the general rules that you would
teach any student and then get
the hell out ofthe way and let the
student do what he or she canldo
naturally. I will, though, suggest
that the student send the story
out to a particular magazine. I
had one like that last semester.
She didn’t get the story published,
but it’s a publishable storygand
somebody’s going to take it. So,

in a sense, I might do even less,
because I don’t want to mess
with what already seems to work.

Do you feel that teaching
creative Writing courses
affects your own writing -—
the interaction with other
Writers?

Definitely. Not only do you
sort of find outwhatyou shouldn’t
do as a writer, once you start
seeing mistakes in your work,
you just sort of learn and grow. I
never really thought of my work
in terms ofa codified set of rules.
I mean, I knew the basic
fundamentals — rudiments, that
sort of stuff, but it helped me to
sort of develop a personal esthetic
for my own work. And sometimes
there are students who do certain
things much better than I do, and
I can learn from them.

Do you feel that a person
can be taught to write fiction?

You know, a writer by the
name of Helma Walitzer has a
saying that you can only teach a
writer how to write. And in a
sense, she’s right, because
somebody who loves language
and reads voraciously and
intelligently and who has a good
ear for the human voice can tell
a story. It’s what parents do and
what schools do, and before a
student reaches the college age
that is all the important ingredients
that make up a writer. All I can
really do is help people refine the
skills they already have, or let
them know that they have skills
that they are unaware of. But as
far as being able to teach someone
how to write, at times I have my
doubts. ~

At What point in your life 44’:

did you realize that you
definitely wanted to be a
writer?

It sort of came in funny stages.
I really wouldn’t call myself a
writer until well after I started
publishing stories. It was just too
fancy of a word for me, and thus
I would call myself ‘a guy who
writes.’ or ‘a person who likes
stories,’ or something like that.

I started writing'poetry at eight,
and I wrote a couple short stories
for kicks. And then I wrote a little
bit of fiction at 14. I didn’t really
begin to take it seriously until I
was 21, and I certainly didn’t say

Continued from page 5-10

“I want to be a writer.” It just
seemed like too big and too
pretentious a thing to ask of
yourself. So I guess it sort of was
a slow accumulation of things. I
can’t remember at a particular
point where I said, “Ah, this is my
destiny.” 4

You spent some time in
Africa. Did you pull your
experiences from that and put
them into I Get on the Bus?

Yeah, although I wouldn’t call
the novel autobiographical. It’s
n_otbecause I’m trying to distance
myself from some of the
reprehensible things that the
major character does and says.

 

itt ew File Photo

It’s just that in everything I’ve
written, whether I’m writing from
the point of view of a female
graduate student in chemistry or
whether I’m writing from the
point of view of a 70-year-old
Alabama store owner who
happens to be white, that’s all my
personal insights and visions. So
everything I do is
autobiographical in that sort of
general sense. It all comes from
my sensibilities and my emotions.

I went to Africa and I saw it in
a certain way, I experienced
certain things. I realized at certain
times that there are people who
go there and don’t see the things
that I might and interpret it in an

entirely different way.

But if you’re talking about, ‘did
I have malaria?’ Yeah. And did I
suffer maybe a spiritual and
intellectual crisis? Yeah. But it’s
not the same experience that I
write about. I think I’m still
grappling with, in a certain
theoretical language, my reading
of Africa. It’s something that’s still
with me and I can’t articulate that
—— the real experience. Butl can
create another character, who
has roughly similar sensibilities
and attitude, to a certain degree,
but an entirely different
background and a different
purpose, and write a story about
that.

Rainer gets due recognition for
this ambitious piece ofwork. But

The festival also featured a new
film from one of the founding
fathers ofthe French New Wave,
Eric Rohmer. Rites of Spring
continues Rohmer’s obsession
with young women talking each
others ears off. The film boasts a
flawless cast, some enchanting
scenes and is much more
satisfying than Rohmer’s last, '1he
Adventures of Reinette and
Mirabelle.

Other highlights included the

Chinese ju Dou and the African
T ilai. Coming from completely
alien cultures, the films spoke to
me on a less personal level. Still,
there was much to enjoy in these
beautifully filmed depictions of

human joy and suffering and .

The lyrics are deep and

the melodies. Susie I-Iug’s vocals
are so natural, it’s almost as if

she’s just speaking the words. ,

Her voice is surprisingly far from
shrill even when she carries-the
highest of notes.

The Katydids’ first single in
Britain was “Lights Out (Read My
Lips),” which is a good song

except for the monotony of the
chorus. Cuts to look out for are
the melodic “Dr. Rey” and “Stop
Start,” which has a hip beat like
something coming out of

The Katydids gave up nothing
for their record label. They wanted
to produce a record that sounded
“alive,” and ‘with producer Nick
