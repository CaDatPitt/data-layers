Pitt Lacrosse player
is seriously injured

By Michele Quinn

Staff Writer

A University of Pittsburgh stu-
dent was seriously injured at a
Panther lacrosse gamegThursday.

Bob Mankowski, a senior com-
puter science major, was listed in
fair condition after. fracturing
three vertebrae and undergoing
surgery Monday morning.

”They don't even know exact-
ly what else is wrong right now,”
said Craig Jackson, vice president
of the lacrosse club. ”They aren't
really giving any percentage as to
his recovery because they just
don't know. Hopefully, they will
know something by the end of
the week.” '

According to Jackson,

‘Mankowski was in surgery for

four hours on Monday morning.
Surgeons replaced the fifth ver-

tebra with a wire and a bone from

Mankowski’s hip. .

”The bone is supposed to grow
around the wire and fuse the ver-
tebrae together,” said Jackson.
”They didn't even know that the
fourth and sixth vertebrae, were
fractured until they ,went in
there.”

Jackson said that they only
worked "with the fifth vertebra.
Mankowski’s doctors want to
wait and see the results of the first

surgery before they operate again '

on the fourth and sixth vertebrae.

”They are hoping that maybe
the fourth and fifth will heal on
their own,” said Jackson.

A nerve test was performed,
and surgeons discovered that
there was no damage to the spi-
nal cord, _said Jackson.

At this time, Mankowski para-

The results of a University of
Pittsburgh study on when reading,
failure begins states that many of
those surveyed" experienced read-
ing difficulty when school read-
ing tasks changed.

According to the reading histo-
ries study, half of those surveyed
blame themselves for their inabil-
ity to read, while one—third of
those who remember when they
learned to read described the ex-
perience as negative. The results
of the study, which was conduct-
ed by Pitt and the Coalition for
Adult Literacy, were released
yesterday. .

The study examined the read-

lyzed from his waist down.
”He can move his arms and
fingers but not his legs. However,
he can feel them when the doc-
tors touch them. They say that is
a good sign,” said Jackson.
The accident happened on

Thursday night when the Panther,

lacrosse‘ club played the
Washington and Jefferson
Presidents.

’’It was a freak accident. No
one was at fault,” said Jackson.
”He was playing defense when'a
player on the other team jumped
up to get the ball. Bob hit the

guy's hip with his head. That

jarred his neck.

”No one even tried to move
him. He was conscious the whole
time. At first he couldn't feel any-

thing,” said Jackson. A
~ At this time, Mankowski is be-
ing kept immobile.

”He can move his arms, but
not the rest of his body. They
want to keep his spinal chord im-
mobile,” Jackson said.

Jackson also said Mankowski

_ has a very good attitude_.. H I __ 
”Bob said, ’We’ll wait”’tiI the"

surgery and then go from there.’
He already is trying to figure out
how to keep up with his classes
and what to schedule for next
term,” said Jackson. A

Joyce Ciangarlo, acting direc-
tor of Student Activities, said that
she has already been in contact
with the College of Arts and
Sciences concerning
Mankowski’s classes.

”He was supposed to graduate
in December. I called CAS, and
they pulled his schedule and are
sending letters to all of his profes-
sors,” Giangarlo said,

ing experiences of 128 Pittsburgh

metropolitan area adult poor’

_readers enrolled in reading im-
provement programs.
Shirley Biggs, Pitt professor and
principal investigator of the
study, said, ”Poor readers seem

to have difficultywhen reading‘

tasks shift from a decoding*em-
phasis to one of comprehension
and when they are presented
with more complex reading
material.”

According to thestudy, survey
participants blamed themselves
for their reading difficulties and
cited a lack of interest in reading
as the reason.

The regional investigation be- '

According to Giangarlo, the
outcome of the university hearing

According to the researchers,
the family did not play as big of
a role as expected in shaping the
reading habits» of survey par-

Shultz says Chinese social reforms will continue

BEIJING — Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, after almost
seven hours of talks with Chinese
leaders, said he was con_vinced
China would not abandon its
open—door reform policy.

Shultz, speaking at an evening
banquet, said the two nations had
”reaffirmed our common interest
regarding some of the major
sources of tension within the Asi-
an region,” including the wars in
Afghanistan and Cambodia.

He said he had been assured
that the Chinese would not scrap
the reforms he said have brought
”unparalleled successes” during
this decade.

Prisoners can reduce
time for clean slate

HARRISBURG — The Senate
Judiciary Committee approved
legislation that would allow state
prison inmates to reduce their
sentences, and possibly prison
crowding, through a so—called
earned—time program.

Under the legislation, many in-
mates with maximum sentences
of two years or more would be
able to earn six days of ”good
time” for each calendar month
completed without violating pri-
son conduct.

A prisoner serving a life sen-
tence wouldn’t be able to ac-
cumulate earned time unless the
sentence is reduced through a
commutation. In addition, no in-
mate serving a mandatory mini-
mum sentence could earn good
time.

Sen. D. Michael Fisher, an Al-
legheny County Republican who
sponsored the bill, said Pennsyl-

Riot police fire tear
gas to stop marchers

SEOUL, South Korea — Tens of
thousands of riot police firing tear
gas on Tuesday blocked an
opposition-sponsored ”peace
march” commemorating a dissi-
dent college student who died
under police torture.

There were no immediate
reports of clashes in six other
provincial cities where similar
marches were scheduled to take
place simultaneously at noon.

The clashes in Seoul broke out
as thousands of people tried to
march along sidewalks marking
the 49th day after the death of
Park Chong-Chul, 21, a Seoul Na-
tional University student who
died by police torture Jan. 14.

UP]sets fund raising goal at $8.7 million

JOHNSTOWN, Pa. —- The
University of Pittsburgh at John-
stown recently announced plans
for an $8.7 million capital-giving
campaign and received a $4 mil-
lion lead gift from Frank I.
Pasquerilla, honorary chairman
of the fund drive, for the con-
struction of a performing arts
center on the UP] campus.

The campaign is being held in
conjunction with the branch’s
60th anniversary and the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh's bicentennial. . _

Pasquerilla, who is chairman of
the board and chief executive
officer of Crown American Co_r-
poration, Johnstown, announced
his gift to the branch at a lunch-
eon last week.

”The Pasquerilla Performing

_ Arts Center will be an exciting

catalyst in developing a creative
atmosphere in our area,” he com-

mented. "The center will be a .'

way for us to share UP] with the

entire community.  The produc- ‘

tions and programs will immeas-
urably add tothe quality or life at
our UP] campus and to the Great-
er Johnstown area." '

Plans call for the structure to’

house facilities for the presenta-
tion of theatrical and musical
productions, as well as art and
photography exhibits, by mem-

bers of the UP] and Johnstown ’

communities and by touring
professionals from across the na-
tion and around the world. A

’’I am so happy and pleased to '

be able to do this for the people

of Johnstown and for UP],” the

Jonhstown businessman said.

Pasquerilla summarized his
past involvement with both the
branch and the university. During
the 1960s, he was instrumental in
developing and completing the
present campus" in suburban
Richland Township, served on
both the branch’s advisoryboard
and the university's board of
trustees (the latter as a common-
wealth trustee- appointed by

How can   Reagan

regain popularity

The Tower commission report blasts Reagan and continues

 to haunt him in his choices for high-level positions. Donald
T _ Regan lost his job, and we are still left with a vacant director's

office in the CIA.
The most important question we can now ask ourselves is
this: What does Reagan do to regain the popularity lost in the

Iran scandal, or maybe, more appropriately, is there anything T

he carido to win back the people's trust? ,

The answer must be that there is nothing he can do but wait
and hope the people he has appointed are more capable of
running the government than he has been. Reagan will address
the nation tonight at 9 p.m. inorder to discuss the Tower com-
mission report and_ the political fallout it generated. ,

Short of coming to the nation with a resignation, there is lit-
tle that could be accomplished in a speech to refute the mud
the public has been forced to see over the course of the inves-
tigation. A recent poll showed that Reagan's popularity is at
an all-time low and that there is a significant portion ofthe
American population who feel that voting for Reagan was a
mistake. , V
- In the face of such opposition, what's a poor president to do?

I At this point, his only option seems to be doing what he does

best’ —— nothing. ’ .

For months, we have heard that most of the current political
problems in the White House stems from Reagan's lack of in-
terest in doing — or ability to do — anything at all.

Maybe then he should do just that and let politicians with

at least a thread of competency and understanding do the job

he was elected to perform.

Cathedral light-up
needn't be constant

.  "Look, up there in the sky! It's a scene from a sci-fi movie.

No, it's a huge, lighted monolith, covered with Christmas |i.ghts.
No, butlook, it's really the Cathedral of Learning.
- We have to wonder why, in the dark environment of energy

. conservation, the Cathedral remains lighted night and day. Why

are we witness to such a blatant display of commercialism and
largess? What purpose is served by keeping the Cathedral lit,
especially in the daytime? .

One could suppose that the impetus for the.decision_stems
from the celebration of the Pitt bicentennial, and that the light

. on the Cathedral merely symbolizes the festive feelings we all
‘have — or should have.

The Cathedral used to be lit when there was a special event
at Pitt, when we had something to celebrate, not to seemingly

Wjcelebrate the coming of each new day and night.

There is..always the possibility of overkill for any good idea,
and the waste of electricity on the Cathedral would seem to

' _be a blazing example. When we use our tallest building to ex-
press elation on the part of the student. body, we should be

careful that we truly have something worth celebrating. Possi-

" bly we do, but every day?
It is time for the administration to tone down the gala por--

trayal of the university and be festive with reservation. It will
mean a lot more to all of us that_way.

‘  PITT NEWS, .Wednesday, March 4, I987. ;. 

7;‘. There is an old Rogers and Hart

song most of our grandparents
probably used to dance to called
"Isn't it Romantic?”

Let's change that title a little,
shall we? For this day and age,
let's call it "Isn't it Convenient?”

In lieu of the recent events hap-
pening in and around Washing-
ton, D.C., this title not only fits,
but may just go as far as being the

/-

-Onational anthem of 1987.

Gee, what a coincidence that
not one day before he is sched-
uled to appear before an inves-
tigating committee, CIA director
William Casey is rushed to the
hospital with a brain tumor. Trag-
ic, yes. Unfortunate, yes. But isn't
it convenient?

Let's look at some of the other

characters. We have Fawn Hall,.

‘.,,\who listens to every word her

boss Ollie issues and shreds
papers thinking the outcome will
be shipped to starving Third
World countries to be used as
fiber for peoples’ diets; Robert
McFarland, munching down
Valium tablets like candy while
watching the late show; Admiral
John Poindexter, who, while
weeping over his autographed

rt portrait_of Ike and himself in the

good old days, accidentally
scalds his tongue on coffee or
something so that he just can't
say anything even if he wants to.

And, of couse, good old Don
Regan, who obviously subscribes
to the idea: "If it starts getting too
deep, just quit.”

Isn't it convenient?

And, last but certainly not least,
because of those nasty little
carcenoma polyps invading his‘

$5 rectum, Ronald the Washington

Rustler gets a nice whoopie
cushion for the chair in his office.
Isn't that convenient?

PoorJohn, poor Don, poor Bill
and poor Ron. Fawn loves a Con-
tra, and Ollie doesn't know a
thing about it. He's too busy buff-,
ing his green beret.

If someone had told me these

Col I e ge ,

I imagine many of you will en-
tirely disagree with this at first,
but these are the best times of
your life. Really, they are. Believe
me, I was a skeptic at first too.

says that obviously didn't go to

It doesn't sound like the best
times of a person's life, does it?

That's what I thought. So, I
talked to some graduates, people
who have been out of school
anywhere from a few years to 20.
They all said the same thing.
"Yes, Kathy, these are the best
times of your life. Enjoy them
now before you have to deal with
real pressures.” As if college was
one big party for me.

I consulted a few psychologists
on the subject. To my satisfaction
they agreed that the college years
were probably the most stressful
in a person's life because we
young adults are faced with so
many "new situations and deci-

- sions. Ha, I thought, wait"til-I tell,
my parents this. Maybe now f

characters were in a script by.

Stanley Kubrick or in a novel by

Philip Roth, you can bet I-would v-

rush out and pay any price to ac-
quire them. What satire! V

But they're not satire. They're
not even fictional. These charac-
ters are real — so real, they are
vehemently trying to control me,
you, the lives we all lead and the
lives our children will lead.
' Usually, I scoff at anyone who
will condemn the presidency for
the sole reason that they simply
do not like the person who is fill-
ing the position. I feel that even
if someone does not like the per-
son, respect must be held for the
office itself and the position it
represents — at all times.

But now, it is getting hard for

even me to do this. This is going
too far.
_ From reading what I already
have written, many have proba-
bly labeled me a liberal. This is
not true. But on that same hand,
neither am I a conservative.

My -beliefs are looked upon
nowadays, regretfully, as pre-
historic. I, along with Gerald
Ford, Gary Hart and Robert Dole,
am a moderate. What I like to see
is strong midd|e—of-the-road
ideals — ones that help the popu-
lus internally as well as protect it
externally. The procedures of the

1'‘! ..__—:.._u; ...»

current administration I see as
nothing but goofy, right-wing
fanatacism. A

Just after the 1984 elections,
The New Republic did a cover
story on Reagan titled "Is He All
There?” I extend to you this same
question to ponder. The reports
of his attempts to relive his old
movies were funny in the early
'80s, but the idea has lost its hu-
mor. The man supposedly run-
ning our country thinks he's in a
rerun of The Gunfight at the O.K.
Corral. ’

So, while Ronnie is in la—la
land, eating his jelly beans and
playing with the horsies Louie B.
Mayer gave him, in step his aides.

But now, they have been
caught. The Teflon president has
a scratch in his coating. The
"sleaze factor” has finally
returned home. Add all the new
names to the list containing such
distinguished players as James
Watt, Anne Burford, Edwin
Meese, Michael Deaver, David
Stockman  Again the list goes
on. . I

The situation has gotten
ridiculous. And the newest chap-
ter in the fiasco, appointing the
truly great Republican Howard
Baker as chief of staff, only fur-
thur proves they will do anything
to try to cover their tracks and
preserve the "you’re an American
if you wave a flag and toot
’Yankee Doodle’ out your ass”
image.

I'm sure Reagan is a nice man, _

but if his facilities are not func-
tioning, plainly and simply, he
should not be the leader of the
land. And, in the same respect,
neither should his henchmen.
In this case, only a man with
the intelligence of a Robert Dole
or a‘ Gary Hart will be able to
straighten the whole mess out. It
seems strange and at the same
time disheartening that the new
Iran-Contra scandal makes
Watergate seem like "a mis-
demeanor. .

KATHY sum.

they'll be a little more sympathet-
ic. Wait till I tell them that the sui-
cide rate‘ is increasing for college
students. -

Why? I know we're facedwith
a lot'of new situations and deci-
sions  but suicide?. Nothing can
be that bad, can it? Why would
anyone put that much pressure
on themselves? '

And then it hit me -— OK it J

wasn't like a bolt of lightning, it

just crept up and hit me. We are ‘

unneccessarily placing stress
upon stress on ourselves.

I think what it comes down to
is that we young adults are being
wimps. These college years are
the first times many, though not
all encounter real stress. I'm talk-
ing about financial worries,
careeer decisions and such.

But it's not that bad.

So what if you have a paper
due. So what if you're broke. So
what if you don't have any idea
what you'll be doing five years
from now. Think of it as an ex-

— change for oneof the best learn-

ing experiences you'll ever have.

And" I'm not talking academic. _

Years from now what doyou
think you'll remember aboutyour
college career? There are certain
incidents that come to my mind
instantly. I remember my very
first week of school. I was attend-

_ ing Pitt at Johnstown. My room-

mate and I lived on a floor with
all sophomores and we were
mortified because we were stay-
ing in on a Friday night. We
didn't know where to go. We ac-
tually turned out the lights in our
room and pretended that we
were out.

I can't even count all the times
in the past 4 years,|'ve stayed up
all night trying to learn two
months of work in 12 hours. But
with some friends, munchies and
lots of coffee, it wasn't that bad.
In fact, it was even fun. Can you
imagine, studying being fun?

I remember living in a quad in
Holland Hall. I never thought I'd
live through the term.

I" think of all the friends I've
met. People I know I'll never for-
get. I remember countless discus-
sionswith them about the future,
about our goals, our dreams-

But that's just it. This is my time
to learn, to experiment, to dream.

not the real thing

What you are about to V .
read is an interview with
Susan Stafford.

You say you don't know
who Susan Stafford is? Su-
san Stafford is the woman
who turned the letters on
Wheel of Fortune before
Vanna White was hired.
Stafford began when the
show began, in the
mid-'70s, and quit in I982.
Vanna White was chosen
to replace her, the show be-
came the biggest hit in the

 
   

AL . l  
BOB GREENE

"When we taped the pilot, the host was Ed ’Kookie' Byrnes,"
Stafford told me the other day. "But when the show actually
went on the air, the host was Chuck Woolery. After Chuck left,
Pat Szljak replaced him. Pat had been the weatherman at the
local NBC station in Los Angeles.''

Stafford. said that even though she was making a good living
on Wheel of Fortune by 1982, «the job was starting to make her
question -her priorities.

"I mean, for seven years I stood there and turned letters,"
she said. ''I had to ask myself if that was any way for a grown
woman to live her life." P

So she handed in her resignation. The first thing she did after .

leaving the show was to work at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston,
specializing in pastoral care education and working with dy-
ing cancer patients. Since then, she has written and hosted a
health—oriented show on cable TV, has done documentaries
about leprosy and has studied psychology.

Naturally the questionlcomes up in her ‘mind: What if she
had stayed with Wheel of Fortune? Right after she left, the show
added a nighttime, syndicated -‘version to its daytime slot on
NBC. It was the nighttime version that made Wheel of Fortune
a phenomenon, and that made White a megacelebrity. If Stafford

had stayed, maybe it would have been her photograph on the

cover of Newsweek instead of Vanna's.

"Do I kick myself?" Stafford said. "No, I like myself too much
for that. Do I miss the money? You bet I do." She said that she
was financially "just getting by." .

As for the stardom that has come to Vanna White, Stafford.

said, "The success of Vanna? I'm amazed, but I think it's fine.

"I broke her in. When I was leaving the show and she was
joining the show, I showed her what to do. It's not like you
have to teach somebody a whole lot. I just showed her how
to turn the letters_and told her that she should be grateful for
this opportunity.

"What do I think of her? She's got a good body and wears

pretty dresses. She's a harmless, sweet girl that doesn't mean .

anybody any harm. When I was showing her how to turn the
letters, she was [really] grateful. Her eyes got real big. She was
so happy to be there. It reminded me of how I was at the be-
ginning. But let's face it, no matter how much money you make

or how famous you become, you're still just the’ girl on the game

show turning the letters."

Stafford said that she has only watched the show once or twice .l

since leaving. "|'ve never felt nostalgic," she said. "I'm surprised

they haven't changed the format. Actually, when I've watched -

the show, I have felt a sort of relief. Relief that I don't haveto
do that anymore."

At one point, when Vanna had to miss the show for a week
because of the death of her boyfriend, the producers of Wheel
of Fortune called Stafford and asked her to fill in. She agreed
to do it. ' .

''It was easy," she said. "It's a pretty simple job. Going back
to it was apiece of cake."

Thinking back to her years on the show, Stafford said that
two dominant thoughts used to fill her mindas she stood by"
the puzzle board and turned the letters: "I was thinking a com-
bination the contestant will win and how sore my feet were."

Stafford, who just turned 40, said that she hopes other op-
portunities will develop for her. When pressed, she admitted
that, had she known what was going to happen with Wheel
of Fortune, she might have stuck around. .

"But I didn't,’and I'm happy with who I am," she said. "The

one thing that bothers me is when I tell people what! used to ’

do, and they say, 'You mean you were Vanna White before Van-
na White?’ That gets a little annoying. But I put up with it. It's
just part of life." I

CMU grad takes over econ center

By Lisa Hallman
Staff Writer 4

A Carnegie'Mellon University
graduate recently assumed the
duties as the director of the
University of Pittsburgh Graduate
School of Business’ Center for
Economic Education. ,

Dr. Annette L. Giovengo, 25, a
specialist in regional economic
development, will oversee all ac-
tivities of the center's communi-
ty outreach programs. These
programs are designed to im-
prove economic literacy in the
Pittsburgh region.

Economic literacy is essential
in the Pittsburgh area where high
technology plays a key role.

”The biggest problem in any
kind of planning or development
work is that the people who live
in the area have to really under-
stand the economic system and
understand what's happening to
them in order for them to do well
in any kind of transition,” she
said.

A Pittsburgh native, Giovengo
said the center's varied programs
are directed primarily toward

area school districts, teachers and
students. Giovengo estimates be—
tween l00 and 150 schools in
the Pittsburgh area are involved
in the programs.

The center conducts a Student
Stock Market Game twice a year
in conjunction with the Pitts-
burgh Post-Cazette Educational
Services Department. [Student
teams are given an imaginary
$100,000 to invest in the stock
market. The center advises the
students, and the winning team
receives a one-day trip to Wall
Street.

The Center for Economic Edu-
cation also conducts" the Berger
Engstrom Essay Contest, which
awards a cash prize to the student

' who writes the best essay on eco-
nomics. The topic is provided by
the center.

Giovengo said the goal of the
center is ”to train students to un-
derstand our economic system so
they can become better workers,
consumers and citizens.”

’ A major project at the center is

Giovengo said DEEP ”is a more

ly with the teachers and their cur-
riculum. ‘
Presently three area school dis-
tricts. —— Pittsburgh Public
Schools, . Pittsburgh Diocese

Giovengo noted, ”Over time we
would like to have virtually all of
the districts in the region in-
volved.” V

Nationally, DEEP has been suc-

cessful. Giovengo said she hopes
this will hold true in Pittsburgh.

The non-profit center, founded
in 1979, is associated with the na-
tional Joint Council on Econom-
ic Education and the Pennsyl-
vania Council on Economic Edu-
cation.

Funded by grants from PPG in-
dustries, H.J. Heinz Co., the Wes-
tinghouse Education Fund, the
Walker Foundation and the
University of Pittsburgh, the
center is one of 170 economic
education centers nationwide.

”We want to grow and main-
tain our quality as we grow,”

Greek funds to go
to Harmarville  

By Michele Quinn
Staff Writer .

This year the money raised
during Greek Week will be
donated to the Harmarville
Foundation, a local facility
offering complete medical re-
habilitation for people who
have had disabling accidents.

”We really think we are go-
ing to reach our goal of
$62,000 this year,” said Linda
Wolf, overall Greek Week co-
chairwoman. ”We inter-
viewed a lot of charities. Har-
marville was the one that
really seemed to want to get
involved to try to help us raise
the money.”

Harmarville, a 200-bed fa-
cility, is one of the largest re-
habilitation centers in the
country. '

”We treat patients who have
had strokes, accidents, ampu-
tations, head or spinal inju-
ries,” said Janet Sinberg, vice
president of the Harmarville
Foundaﬁon.i

Greek Week overall chair-
men Linda Wolf and Ken
Kumer have been working
with Sinberg to organize
events which will raise money
for a-new sports program to be
instituted at Harmarville.

”We would have had to put
this program on the back burn-
er for about five years without
the aid of Greek Week dona-
tions,” said Sinberg.

Wolf said the money will be
going toward HEALTH-

— HEALTHSPORTS will be the

SPORTS, a program which

will help the severely
disabled. '
According to Sinberg,

first type of fitness, wellness 7‘
and sports program of its kind
in the region. ‘

”The program will provide
a range of possibilities to the
disabled person. We will offer
basketball, track and field and
swimming,” said Sinberg.
”We are also going to try to
have outdoor camping.

”We aren't trying to make
athletes out of all of the pa-
tients. We're trying to provide
a range of opportunities that
will enhance their physical fit-
ness as well as allow them to
reintegrate into activities with
able-bodied people,” said
Sinberg.

‘Harmarville’s eventual goal
is to go into community-based
organizations, such as the

YMCA, and to help establish es,

similiar said
Sinberg. ,

”We are not only raising
money through Greek Week,
but we are also having the Pitt
students involved actually see
what Harmarville is all about,”
Sinberg said.

Since the beginning ofJanu-
Greek members have
been visiting the facility and
learning about the rehabilita-
tion process. ' — j-._

excuses,

what comes next?

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ With

stretched arms, the Temple
University student claimed he
was late for class because he
stopped to help a cat who was
stranded in a tree.

Another said his tardiness was
caused by a flat tire when some-
one suddenly hurled a bottle un-
der his car. Stillanother said her
car caught on fire.

These are some of the excuses
used by enterprising students

turning in term papers or anxious
to leave for spring break, accord-

ing to Temple journalism profes-.

sor Hiley H. Ward.

Ward cites these and other ex-
cuses in his article, ” ‘I Couldn't
Get to Class Because...’ Some of
the Greatest Stories Ever Told,”
in the spring 1987 edition of
Campus USA magazine.

”Student excuses form a great
body of American lore,” Ward
observes, ”and some day, some-

body is going to pull them all
together and sell a handy how-to
booklet, ‘All the Excuses You
Should Know and Hav,en’t
‘Tried.’ " ' ;

Ward has made a start withrthe
collection. Among excuses used
by students at Temple and other
colleges and universities: I

A Temple student told his
professor he had to leave early for
spring break because his sister
was getting married..Suspicious,
the professor asked where the
wedding was being held. ’’Fort
Lauderdale,’’ said the student.

At the University of Santa
Clara, a student told her market-
ing professor that her dog ate the
computer diskette containing her
papen

A junior at Central Michigan
University informed his skeptical‘
professor that he missed class be-

cause of an allergy attack he had

while dragging a deer out. of the
woods on a hunting trip.-

’’I got this terrible reaction,” he
said. ”My nose was running._l
went to the doctor, and he said
I was allergic to fur."

A young woman claimed she
left her term paper at her aunt's
house, went back to retrieve it
but accidentally set off a burglar
alarm and was arrested.

A journalism student at the

University of Kansas told her

professor she had to leave early
for spring break because ”My
father is flying "me and some of
my sorority sisters to the Virgin Is-

lands in his corporate-jet. He‘

doesn't want to have to pay the
pilot overtime, so we have to
leave early in the morning.”
An experienced listener to ex-
cuses, Ward has some avuncular
advice for students who must do
some fast thinking in the class-
room. ’’In telling and presenting
an excuse,” he said, ”it’s impor-
tant to be convincing.” -
Asalast resort, there's always

the truth-. Ward tells of one stu-
, dent who wrote this explanation

The purpose of the program, as
well as similar programs, was-to
see if the dosage of the medica-
tion could be reduced and to
check for side effects.

Many of these drugs are used
by the elderly and by those who
care for them. The goal of the
pharmacy school was not only to
test the drugs but to educate
those people using _and ad-
ministering them.

the second award. Kalp said this

money will go to help pay for her’

‘ By Laura Siyufy

For The Pitt News

The thought of abandoning our
Western lifestyle and living a sim-
pler life seems to be a welcome
thought for many people. Dr.
Richard Scaglion, a legal anthro-
pologist and professor at Pitt, re-

cently had the opportunity to do
.-just this. - 0‘

For the past several years,
Scaglion has studied a tribe in
New Guinea known as the
Samukundi Abelam. The Abelam
tribe is located in a lush tropical
rain forest in the Prince Alex-
ander Mountains.

Scaglion chose the Abelam be-
cause he was*curious to see how
the introduction of Western cul-

ture and courts would effect the
tribes lifestyle.

He said, ’’I wanted to see how
Westerners went about telling
people what the courts were all
about, what the problems were
and why they didn't use them.”

In his studies, Scaglion initial—
ly tried not to disrupt the Abelam
by precipitating change.

”In the beginning when I went,
I tried not to disrupt them at all,”
he said. ”So I lived in exactly the
kind ofhouse they lived in, I ate
exactly what they ate, and I did
exactly what. they did.”

Later, Scaglion decided to
make a lifestyle that suited him
but only allowed himself things
which the Abelam could obtain

didn't think I was in danger, and
if there was going to be some
danger, you would get a signal of
it, and you could take off into the
jungle.”

Initially, Scaglion had the ex-
pected fears of living in un-
familiar circumstances. He was
wary of reacting unfavorably to
unknown customs and social
practices.

”One day, I saw oneof my
Abelam friends slip in the mud.
I was tempted to laugh but real-
ized I might offend him,”he said.
Scaglion could not suppress his
laughter, but his friend un-
derstood.

Scaglion wrote in a recent pub-
lication that he was convinced

Anthro profconcludes studies in New Guinea

that the traditional way’ of life of
the Abelam was rich and ful-
filling.

Unlike some of the Westerners
who were trying to modernize
the Abelam, he said, ”I did not
feel that their rejections of certain
development projects [were] due
to ignorance. It seemed rather
that they were concerned about

maintaining their traditional cuL’\

ture and were resistant to disrup-
tive elements.” ,
Scaglion said, ”I don't just
teach anthropology; I try to live
it. There isn't a right way and a
wrong way to do things. There
are different ways to do things.

Open-mindedness should "relate r

to all people, not just the tribes
in New Guinea.”

Family House
offers moral support

By, Karen Barzilay

For The Pitt News A

Family House, at 233 McKee
Place, is as important to out-of-
town patients as the hospital fa-
cilities, state-of-the art technolo-

_ gy and medical_ talent.

People come to Pittsburgh from
all over the United States and
several foreign countries in hopes
of receiving cancer therapy, ‘trans-

‘ plants, neurological surgery and

other treatments that require ex-

- tended care, accordingto litera-
’ ture distributed byFamily House.

Family House offers patients
and their relatives a place to stay;
More than a hospital waiting
lounge or lonely hotel room
could provide, it is intended as a
”home away from home.”

According to a newsletter,
those who reside at Family House
agree that its warm atmosphere,

comfort and understanding resi— A

dents help patients and theirfa-
milies withstand the pressures
that come with a serious illness.

If patients have to worry about
their family's mental stamina or

their fight, but it's also the net-
work of families that provide the
strength and spirit of the house.”

In the same film, the Rev. Les-

House as ”a community of sup-
port that surpasses anything that

able to do for them.”

People in similar situations can
share feelings and discuss their
problems in a peaceful environ-
ment. There are no counselors,
doctors or nurses, just others who
develop friendships and bonds of
understanding.

In the film on Family House, a
patient reflecting on his stay said
that prior to his surgery, two of

the friends he made at Family

House came up to the hospital
and spent time with him.

what that meant to me," said the
former resident.

The past resident manager of

in a farewell message in the Au-

newsletter said, ”Family House is
a place where people minister to

when they're low or by doing the
laundry for someone who has

Soon there may be a second

White House fighting Reagan’s ‘AWOL’

By Terence Hunt
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Battling
suggestions that President Reagan
is losing his grip on his job, the
White House is mounting an ex-
traordinary campaign to portray
him as in charge, on top of events
and not ”an AWOL president.”

In his first appearance as Rea-
gan’s new chief of staff, Howard

' Baker volunteered: ”I’ve never
seen Ronald Reagan more ener-
getic, more fully engaged and

’ more in command ofdifficult cir-
cumstances and questions. ..
He's never been better.”

Meanwhile, the administration
pressed a Search for a new
nominee to head the CIA after
agreeing; to a request by acting

ﬂZZ3[3E7

IPW Aw!»/S 6613’ Amuwi

    

director Robert M. Gates to with-
draw his name.

Gates acknowledged there was
a widespread belief in the Senate
that action on his nomination
should be delayed until the
Senate Intelligence Committee
completes its investigation of the
secret sale of arms to Iran and the
possible diversion of profits to
Nicaragua’s Contra rebels.

While praising .Gates as a
remarkably talented and dedicat-

ll

, ed man,” Reagan said, ”It is clear

that at this point confirmation
proceedings would not be in the
interest of the CIA or the nation.”

Baker said the selection of a
successor to Gates was ”an ur-
gent item on the president's
agenda/’

Speculation about possible

candidates focused on both form-
er National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft and former sena-
tor John Tower (R—Texas) both
members of the Tower commis-
sion that investigated the Iran
arms affair, along with Bobby R.
Inman, a onetime CIA deputy
director; U.N. Ambassador Ver-
non Walters; and Army Gen. Wil-
liam Odum, head of the National
Security Agency,

Tower, contacted by The As-
sociated Press late Monday,
declined comment on a report in
today's Washington Post that he

had been offered the CIA post
-and turned it down.

When a new director is named,
Gates will return to his job as the

— Independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh asked a fed-
eral court to dismiss a lawsuit in
which Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North is seeking to halt Walsh's
investigation. As long as North's
suit is pending, ”It invites poten-
tial witnesses to withhold cooper-
ation.  The mere pendency of
this action may irreparably injure
the ongoing criminal investiga-
tion,” Walsh said. North was
fired from the White House Na-
tional Security Council last
November for his alleged role in
the Iran—Contra affair.

—— President Reagan's popular-
ity is at its lowest level in more

’ than four years, a poll taken after

release of the Tower commission
report said. The New York Times-
CBS poll found that 42 percent of

image

those surveyed approved of Rea-
gan’s handlng of his job, down
10 points from a similar poll five
weeks, earlier.

Approval, of Reagan’s handling
of foreign policy wasat an all-
time low 4 29 percent approval
and 58 percent disapproval. Fifty-
two percent of those surveyed
said the Tower report was fair to
the’ Reagan administration, 22
percent thought it was too easy,
while 8 percent said it was too
hard on the White House.

For the poll, 1,174 people were
surveyed by telephone Saturday
and Sunday. It had a margin of er-
ror of three percentage points.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 4, I937

Remember disco?

I don't know what brought it
up, but a few nights ago, a
couple of my friends and I sat
at the kitchentable in my
apartment till four in the morn-
ing talking about disco music
and other memorable things
from the '70s.

There was certainly a collec-
tion of strange ”music” com-
ing out when we were
growing up. To wit:

I love the night life
I love to boogie
On the disco round!

The singer would scream the
”round” making it all but
decipherable. But that was all
apart of the era, and_it didn't
really matter. You could dance
to it — thatmattered.

Knowing what was being
said was not the point. The
point was to boogie. A lot of
junior high and high school
dances were populated by
boys and girls living a slice of
the life portrayed by John
Travolta in Saturday Night

Feven

The more daring guys wore
some form of gold chain, ad-
ding sparkle to a ha|f—buttoned
shiny polyester shirt revealing
a hairless chest. The girls
dropped the neckline on their
dresses and danced alone

while the guys were off some— _

where acting like tough men.

I think Saturday Night Fever
was the first movie in which
music and scenes captured and
changed the culture of Ameri-
ca. Travolta, in his own way,
was an American hero.

Burn baby burn
Disco inferno

When'| recall this song, I in-
variably think of the film, The
Towering Inferno with O.J.
Simpson leaping into a major
role. He later went on to leap
suitcases and fly through air-
port terminals‘ for Hertz Rent-a-

Car. A sports hero gone awry.

theme song. You get the feel-
ing somebody was listening to
it one day in the clubhouse
and one of the players said,
”Hey I like that song.” Some
reporter heard it and before
we knew it the song was blar-
ing in the background of every
story on the team. An Ameri-
can tradition cheapened in a
way.
Night fever
Night fever
You know how to do it

Ah, yes, the Bee Gees. To
think that they started the
whole thing. Also remember
Donna Summer. A real come-
back by either of these bea-

V cons of disco would be
impossible — and just a bit
nauseating.

Whatthe ’70s meant to us

Overweight teen shoots

Associated Press Writer

‘DeKALB, Mo. — A seventh
grader who frequently was teased
about being overweight and had

dents pulled a gun from his gym
bag and killed a classmate and
himself in class Monday, police

. said.

Nathan D. Faris, 12, of Rush-

handgun from the gym bag when
the tardy bell rang at the start of
history class and went to the front
of the room. -

”Kids teasedehimand asked if

his buddy, and Faris shot him
twice. By this time, all the other
kids were out ofthe classroom,
and the Faris boy apparently
turned thegun on himself.

’’I heard he was a loner, and
they teased him,” Anderson said.
He did not know where Faris got
the weapon; ' .

Five shell casings‘ were found
in the room in the red—brick, one-
story school that houses both
junior and senior high school
students. ’

Billy Couch, a seventh grader
in a nearby classroom where Per-
rin ran and collapsed after being
shot in the arm and side, said
Faris had warned his best friend
last week ”not to come to school
because he was going to shoot
everyone.”

Joe Hawkins, a ninth grader,
said Faris told him last week that
”he was suicidal.”

”| just told him he was a little
strange,” Hawkins said.

Couch and Hawkins said they
could not explain the shooting
but that Faris was often teased by
his classmates. I

’/Everybody always teased him. b

He was overweight, and they
called him chubby,” Couch said.

Principal _-Mark Harpst said’:

Faris was anhonor roll student,
”a quiet, reserved student.-”

”We don't have those kinds of
problems here,” Harpst said. ”A
major problem here is three
tardies. You don't walk in and ex-
pect this. It’s totally devastating,
totally shocking. There's not a
safer place for a kid to go to
‘school than here. That's why it's
so scary.”

Classes were dismissed after
the shooting, but Harpst said
school would reopen Tuesday
with counseling offered to
students.

as consumers of the cultural
medium resulted in little more
than a desire to follow the
music of ‘another era. I find
myself listening to the music of
Bob Dylan, Neil Young and
Jackson Browne more often
than not.

There is also the music for
those ”who dare to be differ-
ent.” It’s not a difference so
much as a-hatred for the re-
hashed drivel of Lionel Richie,
Journey, Bon Jovi, etc.

If nothing else, the music of
the '70s allowed us to dance.
Unfortunately, it disallowed
the challenge of thought-
provoking material. Some say
there are better mediums in
which to provoke thought than
music. But I don't think any
are as entertaining.

Nixon wants compensation
for National Archives papers

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ An at-
torney for Richard Nixon argued
in federal court Monday that the
government should compensate
the former president for what he

’ called the illegal taking of private

presidential papers now held by
the National Archives.

The Justice Department, oppos-
ing the move,‘ said any compen-
sation would be ”a windfall to
former President Nixon.” A
department lawyer added that
”the United States has already

paid for the production of these

papers.”

Nixon lawyer Marty/Minsker _

said the 1974 law passed by Con-

P gress to expedite release of the

Nixon papers deprived the for-

mer president of private property
rights that other chief executives
have always exercised over their
files.

Regulations promulgated by
the Archives to enforce the law
‘also deprive Nixon of his
property rights over the papers,
Minsker said.

”The result is to eviscerate a
basic constitutional right of all of
us,” he said.

Minsker did not say how much
compensation Nixon might seek
for his papers. ‘ '

He made the arguments at a
court hearing on Nixon's lawsuit
to win monetary compensation
for the 42 million pages of docu-

ments plus 4,000 hours of_ record-
ings held by the Archives.

The governmentcontends that

March  my-A 

 

Nixon does not have exclusive -

property rights to the papers and

that ownership is a joint partner- \

ship between him and the
government. -

Justice Department attorney
Neil H.‘Koslowe'argued, ”There
is a sharing of rights of presiden-
tial materials which has evolved
over the course of time.”

When Nixon resigned on Aug.

' 9, 1974, he took personal papers
_ from his office which have never

been turned over to the govern-
ment, Koslowe said, and the rest
have remained in government
buildings.

Pittsburgh — A new drug de-
veloped bytthe Upjohn Com-
pany for the treatment of

Western Psychiatric Institute

Adinazolam, containing
both anti-anxiety and an-
tidepressant properties, has
been tested in other studies
throughout the United States;
The study’at WPIC is the last
trial before Upjohn and_the
Food and Drug Administration
decide to make this drug avail-
able on the market.

The effectiveness of

depression is being tested at.

Adinozolam will be measured
against the effectiveness of Im-
ipramine,
tidepressant medication.
According to other studies,
Adinazolam appears to be as
effective an antidepressant as
lmipramine. The drug has
helped some patients who did
not respond to or could not
tolerate lmjpramine.

Depressed individuals tak-
ing part in the study will
receive one of these two
drugs; however, they will not

McRae building on great success

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

All—Big East. ‘All—American.
All—Wor|d.
Lee McRae, the junior from

Pembroke, N.C., seems to-be All-

Everything these days. With each

day that passes, he continues to

prove that he is the fastest human
in the world.

McRae owns the world indoor

record in the 55—meter dash

(6.00), and he holds the Ameri-
can collegiate record in the
50—meter dash. He is a four-time
All-American, twice indoors and
outdoors and is owner of six Pitt
records. It is only a matter of time
before he adds to this list.

”My main goal is to win the
World Games [Championships]
and go on to win the NC’s
[NCAAs] the weekend after,” said
McRae.

It wasn't too long ago when

track was his only love.

_ In his sophomore year at
Wesproverson High School
McRae had difficulties with the
baseball coach. This spurned him
to turn to track because it was in
the same season.

At Wesproverson he participat-
ed in baseball, track, basketball
and football. It was in track and
football that McRae had greater
success. One season he rushed
for 1,500 yards and was the state

champion in the 100-meter dash .

and was runner-up in the
200-meter dash as a junior.

It was this success that led:

McRae to Pitt, especiallyfor foot-

ball. This was soon to change.
”They wanted me to gain 30

pounds, and I thought 30 pounds

was too much to run with,” said.

McRae, who then left the team
and devoted himself to track.

The footballteam’s_loss was the  

PIease—see McRae, page 16 .. .

Tomorrow, the 1987 Al|—Big
East team will be presented. to

ing nam_ed All—Big East really

Pitt will send its best nine wres-

proven themselves the worthiest
throughout the regular season.

Evans doesn't mind playing in afternoon

By John Enright

Sports Editor

Pitt plays its first round game of
the Big East tournament on Friday
against Seton Hall at 1 p.m. That
early starting time may cause a lot
of people to miss the game. Pan-
ther coach Paul Evans isn't com-
plaining, though. ’’I’d rather play
first. lthink it gives us a little more
rest and takes away having to sit

around in a hotel all day,” he
said.
* * *

Evans, who has been called for
his share of technical fouls this
season, was surprised to hear that
he was picked in a Newsday poll
as the fifth toughest coach on offi-
cials. ”I don't think I am,” said
Evans. ”You never know where
those things come from. It could
have been one or two officials. I

think it's kind of a bush thing.
We're [coaches] supposed to
keep our mouths shut and not say
anything about officials, and they
get a two—page spread.”

Week Award and guess who the
winner is? Yes, Jerome Lane. Af-
ter Pitt beat Connecticut at Fitz-
gerald Field House on Jan. 31,
Lane was asked about some of

‘ Pitt’s tougher opponents on the

schedule. One of Lane's replies
was: ”Yea, when we play George-
town down there in Ohio we just
can't seem to beat ’em.”

In all seriousness, though, I
have no doubt that Lane knows
where Georgetown is really lo-
cated. This is his first year under
the media spotlight, and Lane
likes to talk. He just has to learn
to use better judgement before
opening his mouth.

* * *

Lane continues to receive high
praise for his exploits on the
basketball floor. Seton Hall coach
P.J. Carlesimo had this to say: ’’I
think Jerome is one of the most
improved players in the country

because he channeled his ener-
gies and talents into rebounding.
He's made that the focal point of
his game, and its made him a bet-
ter player and Pitt a better team.”

Carlesimo said he put Lane on

the second-team of his NABC‘

(National Association- of Basket-
ball Coaches) All—America ballot.
* .* >l<

Pitt was 11 points away from
having six players average
doub|e—figure scoring in Big East
games.

Lane (16.9), Charles Smith
(15.4), Rod Brookin (10.6), Mike
Goodson (10.4) and Curtis Aiken
(10.0) all were above 10 a game.

Surprisingly, Demetreus Gore
finished at only 9.3.

In fact, both Aiken and Gore's
scoring averages have gone
down__drastically since confer-
ence play began in early January.

Evans knows they will have to
get hot if the Panthers are to be
successful in post—season play.
”We need outside scoring.

Brookin has given us that,” said '

Evans. ”But we're waiting for De-
metreus and Curtis to make their
move.”

No matter what happens the
rest of the season, here's the five
most surprising stats (both good
and bad) on the Pitt basketball
team this year:

0 Lane's average of 13.8 re-
bounds per game. You simply
can't downplay that one — it's
unbelievable.

5 Gore's league scoring aver-
age of 9.3 points, while shooting
a miserable 37 percent from the
floor. He's improved as an all-
around player, but something is
still missing.

0 Aiken’s 3-point field goals in
the league (12).

0 Lane and Smith's combined
free throw stats —— 311 made in
448 attempts.

0 Freshman guard Pat
Cavanaugh’s average of 9.6
minutes per game in the league
and his shooting percentage of 68
percent (13-19).

Looking for a tournament dark-
horse? Providence seems to fit the
bill. ”Providence could be a
problem. They're disruptive,”
said Carlesimo.

Added Evans: ”lf Providence
plays with wildness and loose-
ness they can beat anybody. They
get you rattled and play so
loose.”

Actually how much of a dark-

horse is Providence? The Friars
have beaten St. John's twice and

Georgetown once this season.

And then there is Villanova’s
National Championship team.

Pinckney has been mentioned al— -

ready. Dwayne McClain played
one year for the Pacers before be-
ing cut. Gary McLain and Dwight
Wilbur are both out of basketball,

and Harold Pressley is doing very V

little for the Sacramento Kings.
These teams were coached to

their success. Georgetown’s John

Thompson is a great coach and

.a great recruiter. Villanova’s Rol-

lie Massimino is also a good
coach.

Boston College was successful
because when they had no talent
at all because they had Coach
Gary Williams, who has since left
for Ohio State.

Lou Carnesecca of St. John's al-
ways gets the most of his players
— always. .

Roy Chipman was called by
many the worst coach in the Big
East. That's not too bad if you
look at the company he had.

The bottom line is this: While
you are watching Mark Jackson’s

keep in mind the man who is be-

‘THE PITT News, Wednesday, March 4,1987 '

By Sharon Haney

Sta ff Writer

Pitt senior gymnast Mike
Mealie has’ been a little disap-
pointed this season.

While warming up befo_re the
Eastern Michigan meet at Trees
Hall on Jan. 17, Mealie, a co-
captain, tore a ligament in his
knee. Now he's only competing
in one event, the pommel horse,
but he might be able to compete
in a few more soon. - . -

”Right now I'm doing rehabili-

tation on my knee — trying to

strengthen it,” said .Mealie,
whose injury has limited his abil-
ity to compete. ”It’s very disap-

pointing. I was going to compete ,

in four or five events. I am trying
to help coach where I can,
though. But I feel like some-
thing.’ 5 been taken away from me.
It's hard watching the other guys
do the floor exercise and the
vault, because I want to get out
there with them. But I know I
can't.

”This is the first major injury
I've had that's kept me out of a
seasonsince I've been in gym-
nastics.” -

Mealie has still been able to
find a silver lining in a dark

. cloud. He has continued to com-

pete in his favorite event — the
pommel horse. ”|t’s been my best
event since my junior year in
high school,” said Mealie.

As is the case with many gym-
nasts, Mealie, who is from Free-
dom, Pa., got started in
gymnastics when he, was in

seventh grade. ”My Phys. Ed.
teacher was also the gymnastics
coach. If he saw someone who
had potential, he'd asked them to
try out for the team. And he asked
me to try out.” , ‘

A good choice, indeed.

The person who influenced

Mealie the most was his high
school coach, Dale Meddock.
”He helped me a lot because.he’s
pretty strict, and he made us work
hard,” Mealie said.

Mealie won the state champi-
onships on the pommel horse
during his senior year at Am-

-bridge High School. ”I knew I
could win it if I hit my routine,
and everything felt right. That was
a big thrill," said Mealie.

But he soon learned that high
school thrills and college thrills
are two separate experiences. At
Kent State three weeks ago,

Mealie was part of another great

victory. ”They had been scoring ‘ '

higher than us. We went there as
underdogs, and everybody hit
their routines, and we won the
meet. It was the best feeling since

everybody got together.”

Mealie has his own personal
goals. ”One of my goals this year
is to break the school record on
the pommel horse. I would also
like to make Nationals,” he said.

At thejames Madison Invitation- - '_
al, Mealie reached one goal by  1'

winning the pommel horse.
Mealie and the Panthers will
compete this weekend at the
Great Lake Championships at
Kent State. Mealie, for one,
doesn't mind the weekend rigors
of collegiate gymnastics. ”It

keeps you training hard — you '

don't let up. You can getinto a
rhythm and get better and better
each week.”

As a senior, one hopes toen-

joy personal and team satisfaction’ --

in his/her last year of competi-
tion. Mealie isn't any different.
”This year has been the best year
as far as‘ everybody‘ getting
together as a team and cheering

each other on. Being a senior,‘ 
you feel as thoughyou shouldtry ’ i

and be a leader. I think this team
can score in the 2605,” Mealie
said. . '

Mealie,’ a communications ,

major, teaches gymnastics at

Gym Dandy’s. ”I enjoy teaching.-

I feel like I'm helpingithe sport
out. I get a feeling of satisfaction

when I teach someone a new 

trick," -he said.

 Friedrich making him

Without wasting any time, Pitt

' I freshman Paul Friedrich has

made a name for himself among

in - Big East distance runners.

At the Big East Indoor Track
and Field Championships held

‘ ' two weeks. ago in Syracuse,
' Friedrich scored a sixth place fin-
 Fish in the 3,000-meter run by
‘ ’ turning in a time of 8.27.
f The time converts to approxi-.
« J mately 9.04 for 3,200 meters, an
'event'Friedrich is much more
familiar with.

While attending Bethel Park
High School, Friedrich estab-

lished himself as one of Pennsyl-
vania's premier 3,200-meter
runners by running 9.16 and
finishing second at the PIAA Out-
door Track and Field Champion-
ships last year.

Friedrich also excelled in cross-
country for Bethel Park —— last
year's PIAA cross-country cham-
pions with a program ranked
among the best in the country.
Friedrich has brought that excel-
lence to Pitt.

This-season he finished 25th in
the Big East Cross-Country Cham-
pionships, making him one of the
top freshmen in the league. "I
think that running for Bethel
helped a lot," Friedrich said. ’’If

coach Steve Lewis, who also
works with McRae. ”He has a

Vasvary shares Lewis’ thoughts.

”Lee's attitude for the team,

McRae has nothing but a great
deal of respect for his teammates,
and it shows.

”The team has been great. If we
keep doing the things we do best,
everybody does what they do
best and to the best of their abili-
ty, we'll go farther," boasts
McRae.

Not only does McRae admire
his teammates, but his opponents
such as Calvin Smith and Carl
Lewis as well.

’’I feel on any given day any-
one can win. We just have to see
who the better man is tonight,"

’ adds McRae.

McRae, a 5-9‘/2 education
major, looks to m_usic as a means
of relaxation. He enjoys different

types of music but lists jazz and _ in

reggae as his favorites.

One would think that having
world recognition at such a
young age would be tough to

country season, and even placed
first for the Panthers at the IUP In-
vitational where he finished 14th
overall. He modestly replied to
this, saying, ”Everybody else just
had a bad race.”

”During cross-country, I was al-
ways chasing Bob [\Neiner] in
workouts and races, but now I
work mostly with-Glenn Rhines,"
Friedrich said.

Rhines, who transferred from
Pitt Johnstown, has also had an
excellent first season for the Pan-
thers. He finished fifth in the
5,000-meter run at the Big East
championships, running 14.52.
This is 50 seconds better than last
year — a landmark improvement

already J

at that distance.

Friedrich respects and appreci-
ates Rhines' ability and hard
work. ’’Glenn and I are so close
in workouts that if I'm having a
tough day, he pulls me through,”
he said. ’’It works both ways,
though, I think I do the same for
him.”

Although Friedrich "had no ex- ,

pectations” when he came to Pitt,
he now has two definite goals: ’’I
want to make it to nationals
[NCAA championships] individu-
ally in track and go to cross-
country nationals as a team.”
He knows that, "Neither will
be easy, but if they were, they
wouldn't mean anything.”

COLLEGE PARK, Md.'(AP)
— University of Maryland for-
ward David Gregg has been
suspended from the basketball
team for a year, retroactive to
the start of this season, for al-

Tuesday's editions of the
Washington Post reported that
the Student Judicial Board sus-

although he didn’t play this

familiar with the case.

Gregg, who will have three

TAMPA, Fla. —— Ray Dan-
dridge, who starred in the Negro
Leagues in the 1930s and 1940s,
was elected on Tuesday to the
Baseball Hall of Fame by the
Veterans Committee, which

‘ again bypassed P-hil Rizzuto, Leo

Durocher and Joe Gordon.

The infielder, now 73 and a
resident of Palm Bay, Fla., also
played‘ in the American Associa-
tion and finished his career in
1953-in the Pacific Coast League.
He never played in the major
leagues. ’

Ed Stack, president of the -Hall
of Fame and secretary of the
Veterans Committee, said others
receiving support from the

will. ' .

”Tracy will stay with a similar
type of training, as she missed
workouts in the fall and has had
a relatively .short season since she
started" practicing in December,”
said Belowich. _

Belowich went on to explain

that in order to compete at their_
~ best times, the swimmers have to

taper their Iworkouts. He said,

. ”That’s why everyone'is on a
different kind of.‘ training -4-_

they’ve been practicing for the

He cited Tricia Rickert as an-

example. _« .
”lnstead of going 500 and 200
yards,- she's ‘focused on the

100—yard freestyle, so we're ‘

changing. her,‘ approach a. lot.”
Belowi_ch also said that in ad.-

dition to changing what they ‘do

also changing what they do in the

Belowich explained, ”We have

training. I like what I've seen
there and I think it will be a big
help.” '

Belowich said he cannot ex-
press enough that he expects
everyone to -swim attheir bests.
However, he is hesitant to predict

how" theLady Panthers will do .

points-wise.

’’I can't predict how any other

teams will do,” he said. ’’I think
we're going to swim really fast,
and, if we do, I think we have a
good chance for some of the
women to achieve All-American
status."

Albright also expressed high
expectations for the meet. .

really like to finish in the top
eight,” she said.

Rizzuto, Richie Ashburn, umpire
Al Barlick, Babe Herman, Tony
Lazzeri, Carl Mays, Red Schoen-
dienst, Vic Willis and Mel
Harder.

All members of the Veterans
Committee were on hand for the

‘voting. It takes at least 14 votes-

for selection to the Hall of Fame,
and only Dandridge was able to
poll enough votes in the two bal-
lots allowed. _ .

Dandridge played for Min-
neapolis of the American Associ-
ation from 1949 through 1952
and was the league's Most Valu-
able Player in 1950, when he hit
.311 with 11 home runs and 80
runs batted in.

He also played with the Detroit
Stars, Newark Dodgers, Veracruz
of the Mexican League, the Ne-

wark Eagles, the New York
Cubans and, in 1953, Sacramen-
to and Oakland of the Pacific
Coast League.

The Veterans Committee,
which includes Hall of Famers
Ted Williams, Stan Musial, Roy
Campanella and Monte Irvin, can
elect up to two persons and has
selected at least one every year
since 1951. Bobby Doerr and Er-
nie Lombardi got the required 75
percent of the vote last March.

In January, the Baseball Writers
Association of America elected
Billy Williams and Jim ”Catfish”
Hunter to the Hall "of Fame.

The recent elections by the

BBWAA of Pee Wee Reese and

Luis Aparicio, both sparkplug—
type shortstops in the 19505

whose career averages were un- '

/

der .270, had generated specula-
tion that Rizzuto also would be
admitted to the Hall of Fame.

Rizzuto, 68 -and a Yankees’
broadcaster, actively has cam-
paigned for his election the past
few years. When his No. 10 was
retired at Yankee Stadium in
1985, he said it was ”_the biggest
thrill of my life, much better than
getting into the Hall of Fame.”

Those eligible for election are

0 players who have been retired at

least 23 years, former executives,
managers and umpires who have
been retired five years —— or six
months if they are over’65 -— and
players who spent 10 years in the
Negro Leagues prior to 1946 or
whose combined Negro League
and major-league experience to-
tals at least 10 years.

of taking the national title. He's

only a sophomore, so he'll only
improve next year.”

Next up is senior Gary Bolin.
”Gary has been hampered by in-
juries all year,” said Stottlemyer.
”He has had a good year,.. but
winning the EWL can make it a
great year. You can never count
him out.”

The only other senior starter on
the team this year is Eric Wertz,
weighing in at 158 pounds. ”He
has had a fantastic year,” said the
coach. ”He trailed off a little at
the end, but he has had a little
rest and should be strong going
into the Tournament. He has
been a great team leader and
probably the best captain that I
have-ever had.”

Representing Pitt at 167 will be
Mike Tongel. Stottlemyer has
been pleased with his year.

”In the beginning, we played
a lot of games with him. We
moved him to 177, then 167,
then back. Yet he never com-
plained and did whatever we
asked. I really feel that he has a
good chance of making it to the
finals. This is where he can prove
it to everyone else.”

There is still some doubt as to
who will be at 1 77 for Pitt. Either
Mike Rossi or Bill Lewis will be

filling the position. ”We will have

these two guys wrestle off at prac— .

tice to see who will go,” said
Stottlemyer.

”Bill has had a good freshman
year. At the start of theseason, he
was a fourth team 158, so hehas
worked himself up,” he con-
tinued. ”He is going to be a good
one before he's through.

”Mike has done a good job

. wherever we put him. He could

work more on his offense. I think
he'll be more of a contribution
next year,” Stottlemyer said.

At the 190 position will be
another freshman, Chris Nufher.
”Chris has had to‘ wrestle guys
who have been much heavier
than he is, so he's had a tough
time,” said Stottlemyer. ”He is a

great kid who will work hard to '

get better.”

The tournament will take place
at Penn‘ State, and the top three
finishers in each weight class will
then go on to the NCAA tourna-
ment in Maryland.

”Don’t count any of our guys

out," said Stottlemyer. ”Every—

body has ‘worked hard for this,
and [we] are all looking forward
to it. We are going to fight our
hearts out in every match and let
the chips fall where they may. I
have confidence that we are go-
ing to do well.”

Pitt Pantherbasketball 

The 1986-87 basketball season hasbeen one of the best in Pitt history and — no matter what happens to. the Panthers in
the Big East and NCAA tournaments — it has been a year to remember. . _ _ _

These photos capture the essence of the Pitt team. Obviously, photos of each player's great individual play couldn't fit in
this paper. But these at least give one a sense of what this Panther team is all about: Charles Smith slams one home against
Connecticut (left), while Jerome Lane (bottom), the Panthers’ best all-around player this season, drives to the hoop against Robert
Morris. '

 nothing else in town is more exciting  

One of the true testimonies to the Panthers’ .suc—
cess is their new found ability to win without. stel-
lar performances from all of their star players.

Demetreus Gore is shown here slamming one "
home against Seton Hall at the field house in Janu-
ary. Gore was Pitt's leading point-producer last sea-
son, but this year hehas found himself in a scoring
slump for the majority of the season.

The man responsible for bringing the Panthers
together is first-year coach Paul Evans. Mike Good-
son gets a taste of how serious-minded Evans can b
in this photo.

Leyland trying to find A

right infield for season

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —-— General
Manager Syd Thrift said that three
months ago the Pittsburgh Pirates
might be persuaded to trade se-
cond baseman Johnny Ray be-
cause minor leaguerlose Lind ”is
ready for the big leagues right
now.” ‘,

Ray, one of the National

A League's top hitters last season,

remains a Pirate, so Managerlim
Leyland must decide whether the
acrobatic Lind is too talented to
remain in the minors or too valu-
able a prospect to waste on the
Pirates’ bench.

”There’s no doubt he's got ta-
|ent,” Leyland said.'“—Syd and I
have been talking every day
[about] which way togo with
him, whether he needs more
playing time.’ It's a question
we've still got to answer/T

Leyland had plentylof infield
questions to answer last spring.

He didn't know if veteran Jason
Thompson or Sid Bream would
Open the season at first, which of
three shortstops — Sammy Khali-
fa, Johnnie LeMaster or Rafael
Belliard —— would start or whether
rookie Denny Gonzalez was
ready to play every day_at third.

Bream finally won the job at
first and went on to hit .268 with
16 home ‘runs and 77 RBI.
Thompson was traded to the
Montreal Expos and is now out of
baseball. Belliard, a third—teamer
last spring, won the shortstop’s
job‘ by default in May after

. LeMaster was released and Khali-

fa bombed at the plate.

And not only did veteran Jim
Morrison beat out Gonzalez, he
supplied much of the Pirates’

' power with career highs in home

runs (23) and runs batted in (88).

Leyland’s primary infield con-
cern this spring is whether Bel-

— liard, a slick fielder but only a

.233 hitter, can keep from be-
coming too much of an offensive

liability.

Because utilitymen Bill Almon
and Mike Diaz can play a num-
ber of positions, Leyland may
keep only one infield reserve. He
will definitely retain a reserve
shortstop for when Belliard is lift-
ed for a pinchhitter. A

That reserve could be Khalifa,
Lind, who has mostly played se-
cond base in the minors, or Onix
Concepcion, a non-roster short-

. stop who played six seasons with

the Kansas City Royals.

”We’ll look at Jose at shortstop
in the exhibition games,” Leyland
said. ”We want to take a good
look at_him. We want to make
the right decision.”

Lind, 22, has batted as high as
.301 and as low as .207 in four
minor-league seasons. He hit
.263 with one homer, 33 RBI and
29 stolen ‘bases at Class AA
Nashua last season and struck out
only '28 times in 520 at—bats.

But his defense attracts the

‘most attention. .Fluid and grace-

ful, he seems to glide across the
second-base bag while taking
double-play throws. -

Then there's his leaping abili-
ty. Thrift swears he has seen Lind,
with not much of a running start,
leap over a player standing on se-
cond. Khalifa has seen him hur-
dle a car. .



Leyland might be more im- "I

pressed by those feats if he were‘

a basketball coach, but. he ..is
more concerned about opening
the season next month with the
right 24-player combination.

"I draw up lineups and combi-
nations every night,'and some-
times everything looks fine,” he
said. ”Then you look, and maybe

- I'm not keeping enough hitters. It

takes a lot of work.”

He doesn't labor long filling in
the names Bream, Morrison and
Ray, who batted .301 with 78
RBI.

”That’s made my job easier,”
he said. ”You know those guys
are going to be solid and be in
there almost every day.” I
