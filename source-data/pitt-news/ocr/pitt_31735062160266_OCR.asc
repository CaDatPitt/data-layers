Allende Commits Suicide After Chilean Coup  

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

“I cannot comment on the death
of this man, Allende.”

This was the reaction of Pitt
Professor Hugo Nutini, resident of
Chile for 20 years prior to 1950, on

the suicidal death of Chile’s
marxist President, Salvadore
Allende.

Allende’s death followed a
violent coup when a four-man
military juanta took control of the
government and declared a state of
seige, according to a late reportof
the Associated Press.

The coup capped weeks of unrest

‘in Chile where the armed forces

ﬁnally asked for Allende’s re-
signation, the report said.

In his last public statement,
made by radio as two air force jets

umveasmr
mrrsfoncu

§\l///4

screamed over his downtown
government house, the report
stated, Allende said, “I will not
resign. I will not do it.”

Moments after the deadline
passed, the AP said, two air force
jets dropped bombs and fired
rockets, severely damaging the
fortress-like presidential palace.

“’i saw it coming about two or
three months ago,” Professor
Nutini said after hearing the news.
.“I knew it was just a matter of time
before it broke. I’m not
surprised.”

Nutini remembered Allende back
when he was a Chilean Senator.
“As a Senator he was always a
leftist, but he was never very
influential until the coalition of
leftist parties won the election in
1970.”

68 Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

/

Early reports from the As-
sociated Press said that the air and
ground assault on the presidential
palace in Santiago forced Allende
and a band of his armed supporters
into surrendering about eight hours
after the military revolt began.

However, a 7:30 EDT report
showed that Allende, rather than
surrender, had committed suicide.

Allende’s slumped body, the
report said, with a bullet through
his mouth, was reportedly found in
the presidential palace after a
20-minute attack by the military.

According to reports, the chief
photographer for the Santiago daily
El Mercurie said he saw Allende
lying dead in the anteroom of the
palace dining hall.

The coup was the first time in 46
years that the traditionally non-

political Chilean military had
overturned a civilian government.

Chile now becomes another on a
growing list of South American
countries to fall under military rule.

Allende took over the presidency
in 1970 with the goal of turning
Chile into a Socialist state. But his
efforts were aborted by an
opposition Congress.

The 65-year-old physician had
spent much of his life seeking the
presidency. He was elected only on
the fourth try in 1970, and only
after Congress confirmed his 36%
plurality at the polls.

Despite Chile’s slide into econo-
mic chaos, Allende never wavered
from his determination to stay in
command and socialize the Chilean
economy.

But army General Heman Brady,

according to reports, said in an
off-the-record interview September
2 that, “I’m afraid the armed
forces are going to have to take
over. This situation can’t go on.”

Norman Gall, a journalist for The
New York Times, has pointed out
the crisis of the Chilean left
controlled by Allende.

He_ cites three cental points; of
conﬂict with Allende regime; 1) the

tremendous inflation_ attacking the ’

economy, 2) the severe food
shortage, 3) and the critical interest
conflicts within the govenmental
colition.

Socialist Alliance, feels the United
States was directly involved in the
overthrow.

UFW Borters with Univ.

Over Lettuce Boycott

BY SHARON SEXTON

Members of the United Farm
Workers (UFW), Pitt students and
faculty members confronted the
administration Monday with the
allegation that the University had
broken a verbal agreement to use
only black eagle, or union lettuce.

Graciela Cisneros, a spokesman
for the UFW explained that in
February 1971, and again last
Spring, the University had. made a
commitment to the UFW to ban all
“scab” or non-union lettuce from
University facilities.

Last week a Pitt student,
sympathetic to the UFW cause and
the Pittsburgh lettuce boycott,
found several cartons of non-union
lettuce in the Tower’s cafeteria.

Thomas Albert, Director of Food
Services, and University spokes-
man at the meeting, admitted that
the food service has been using
non-union lettuce.

Albert said that he was unaware
of any agreement with the UFW
regarding the purchase of lettuce.
He explained this was probably
because the food service had
changed hands since February,
1971.

Although Albert maintains he is
interested in “getting quality for
our dollars," he said he is not
adverse to using only union lettuce.

He explained however, that 'he
could not administrate a ban on
non-union lettuce but that such a
ban would have to come from the
students.

“I can’t make a decision for
3,100 students. The question will
have to be taken to the students on
a referndum to see whether or not
they will support the UFW.”

At Albert's suggestion, the
group appointed a resident student
representative to the soon to be
formed Food Standards Committee
of Student Government. Albert
suggested that the committee,
advised by the UFW representa-
tive, could compile‘ a questionaire
which would inform the students of

the issue and determine whether
they were sympathetic to it.

In response to a question from
Rabbi Philip Sigal, of the
University Chaplains’ Association
and the Hillel Foundation, as to
whether or not Albert would
purchase union lettuce until the
refendum, Albert replied, “I think
you have my support.”

Until the referedum Albert
agreed that no. “scab” or non-
union lettuce or "grapes would be
purchased for University use.

Albert explained that there are
two suppliers in Pittsburgh who
carried union lettuce which he can
purchase with little difficulty
and only a slight price increase
over the non-union lettuce.

Block Studies Choirmon Resigns

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

Dr. Fela Sowande, acting chair-
man of the Department of Black
Community Education, Research,
and Development (DBCERD - or
Black Studies) resigned last week.

The move has heightened an
ongoing controversy in the depart-
ment over his appointment, and
according to Professor Rollo
Turner, has resulted in several
faculty members moving their
offices from the department in
protest.

According to department mem-
bers, the controversy began when
Jack Daniel resigned from the
position of Black Studies Chairman
last spring.

Upon his resignation, Daniel
proposed to Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) that Curtiss E.

B/eok Prospects Seen
for Block Professionals

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

A survey commissioned by the
U.S. Labor Department has reveal-
ed that the prospects of advance-
ment for black professionals in
private industry are bleak, accord-
ing to The New York Times.

Recruiting Management Consul-
tants, Inc., administered the study
in the summer of 1971 to discover
what the long-term status of black
male college graduates has been
upon joining a predominately white
company.

Five hundred blacks, majoring in
science, business administration,
engineering, and law were can-
vassed. and the responses of 61
white supervisors were also sub-
mitted in the firm's report.

The probe divulged that a large
number of those blacks interviewed
“were in staff rather than line
(command) positions and few had
supervisory or managerial re-
sponsibilities. About three-fourths

were technical specialists.’..only
23% were supervisors,” and “4%
were employed at managerial
levels.”

The consultants acknowledged
limitations inherent in their study,

conceding it was not an in-depth -

examination and that similar
statistics for whites had not been
compiled. Nevertheless, according
to The Times, the company
reaffirmed its belief in the
representativeness of the survey.

Measuring advancement on the
basis of average salaries, the study
perceived that earnings for black
professionals with only nine or ten
years of service remained virtually
unchanged following an additional
tenure of six years or more.

The firm hinted that the results

should be interpreted with dis- .
cretion since some of the indivi- 5

duals were drawing $25,000 or
more annually.

(Continued on,l’age 3)

However, the _

Porter, then DBCERD_ Director of
Program Development, replace
him as acting chairman.

Daniel’s proposal, according to
Porter, was accepted by an 11-4
faculty vote. Two weeks later
however, Dr. Sowande.'- was
appointed acting chairman by Dean
Rosenberg.

In response, Porter charged
Rosenberg and several DBCERD
faculty members with “irregular
handling of the matter.”

He said such activities on the
part of the Dean serve to “deprive

the departmental collective in
Black Studies of its human,
academic, and professional
rights.”

He also stated that the appoint-
ment of Sowande was “denying the
faculty of Black Studies its right to
academic freedom and its will in
directing its own affairs.”

Rosenberg replied that a
chairman is not selected by
popularity--but that it is the dean’s
responsibility to select an acting
chairman for the department.”

With the statement, the issue
was brought to a temporary
standstill, and Sowande had

66

remained acting chairman for the
past two months. '

Last week, a faction of the Black
Studies Faculty met in Chancellor
Posvar’s office to oppose the

He added that he was “dis

BY DEBBIE POPP

The“ Student Government Board
held their first open meeting in the
iower lobby of the Student Union
iast night, in an attempt to involve
the undergraduates in the workings
of Student Government.

Prior to introducing the Board
and giving a run down on their
committees, Rege Kaufman, Pre-
sident of the Student Government,
asked for some feedback from the
fifty attending students on the 1:00
a.m. restriction for non-residents
visiting the dorms.

mLis\ted -below is a random

selection of concerns voiced by
those criticizing the proposed
security system beofre Kaufman
closed the discussion, surveying

that no one present was in favor of
the system.

“The University is not at-
tempting to cure the problem. The
moon does not have to be out for a
rapist to be around.”

“No attempt was made to attain
student opinion. The University
does not benefit by trying to
implement costly things that the
student does not want.”

“The sign in procedure should
just be continued after 1:00 a.m.

During the discussion, Sue
Ruffner, board member, interjec-
ted that a petition sponsored by
Student Government and Panhel-
lenic Council is circulating among
undergraduate students which
supports an escort system after 1

a.m. for resident and non resident
guests.

These opinions and the opinion of
the Board summarized in the
following statement by Kaufman
before the meeting will be
presented to the Chancellor at the
Student Affairs Advisor committee
(SAAC) on Wednesday.

“We critize the 1 a.m. restriction
on non resident guests as unjust.
The University owes a commitment
to better security. A lack of
commitment is on the part of the
desk attendants who letvagrants in
and not by student negligence.”

Moving from the security issue,
Kaufman outlined three other goals
of this year’s Board which is
attempting to narrow its scope to
bring about major successes rather
than inefficiency.

Student Government is support-
ing the idea of a new Student
Services building. This would turn
space in the Student Union
currently used by Student Affairs,
Counseling, and Placement over to
the students.

Considering the urban setting
of Pitt which limits athletic
activities, the Student Government
Board intends to make better use of
the $300,000 allocated to the
intramural program. They hope to
have permanent storerooms with
sports equipment installed on the
all purpose and auxiliary fields.

Because of their concern with
academics, the Student Govern-
ment Board has created a student
advisory committee with the
Provost to deal with such issues as
class conflicts and the advising
center.

The next open Student Govern-
ment meeting will be on October 2,
at 2:00.

LeB|cmc Stresses Power

to the People of Forum

BY BILL HADUCK

Paul LeBlanc, discussing “How
to Make a Revolution in the U.S.,
stressed that “only the power of
masses of people will form the
opposition capable of ending
capitalism.”

LeBlanc, speaking at a Young
Socialist Alliance forum, said that
the problems of political corrup-
tion, drugs, inadequate housing,
absence of child care, and others
are directly related to capitalism.
He,feels these issues should be a
basis for a change to socialism.

According to LeBlanc the change
could not be “the gift of some some
smart revolutionary elite. You
can’t get freedom as a gift, You
have to take it with your own
hands,” he said.

He said the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA), has been active in
getting the move to socialism
started. “We’ve had speakers
relate the antiwar movement and
the struggles of the working man to
the need for socialism”, he said.

Discussing his candidacy for
Mayor of Pittsburgh, LeBlanc
admitted he has a slim chance
against the forces of Pete Flaherty.
He sees his candidacy a more of a
“part of the -revolutionary pro-
cess".

He feels, however, that there is
“more potential now than at any
time in the last thirty years” to win
such an election because of the
present dissatisfaction with the
government.

According to LeBlanc, one of the
troubles with our present system of

    

Paul LeBlanc _
government is that it has turned
into a “Capitalist Dictatorship”
with “Political cows like Pete
Flaherty following the Mellons”.
He cited increased military spend-
ing “to defend the Mellons.’ Gulf
oil interest in the Middle East”.

Concerning current government
scandals, LeBlanc said there had
been “Little Watergates” going on
all the while. He added that
government has been “bugging
YSA phones and harrassing our
candidates”.

According to LeBlanc, the YSA is
in the process of suing the
government, specifically the FBI
and CIA, for $27 million dollars.

EDITORIAL

Jekyll info Hyde of lam ?

The Office of Residence Life last week announced the implementation
of a new security system supposedly designed to limit the inﬂux of
vagrants or non-residents into the dorms. After 1 a.m. all
non-residents will be prohibited from entering the residence halls; only
resident students with proof of residence will be admitted.

The new program, developed by the administration without student
input or consent, is chockful of loopholes.

The plan, as defended by Marian Hirst, Coordinator of the Office of
Residence Life, cannot possibly curtail the number of vagrants
wandering through the residence halls either before or after the local
bars have closed.

As our system stands, all guests -- residents, non-resident students,
and non-residents, must be escorted into the residence halls by a dorm
student. Non residents or vagrants, cannot, under the present system,
legitimately gain admittance to the residence halls, they must be
escorted by a dorm student.

' Under the new system residents will no longer be able to exercise their

, judgement in selecting guests after 1 a.m. At that time all residents
become acceptable guests and all non-resident students and
non-residents become unacceptable.

This «plan, implemented at the inconvenience of the residents. and
their guests, does not accomplish what it was designed to accomplish.
As with the present plan, vagrants will continue to frequent the
entrances of the dorms waiting for a momentary breach of security; if
and when they find it, they will slip into the dorms unaccounted for.

The new plan makes the basic assumption that all residents are
potentially harmless and all non-resident students and non-residents
are potentially dangerous. This generalization and the lumping
together of non-residents, both student and non-student, is
unjustifiable. Careful scrutiny of previous criminal offenses in the
dorms will show that most offenses were committed by non-resident,
non-students.

‘What we need in terms of security is the system we already have
which leaves the selection of the guests up to the students and which
controls the inﬂux of guests by an escort system. The only problem
with this system aslt presently exists is that it is not being *-enforced.

Last night two security doors in the Towers, both designed to be
opened only by residents with keys were held open by clumps or paper
in_ the keyholes. Any potential criminal, resident, non-resident
student, or non-resident could have easily gained access to the dorms.

Last night was no exception. This example of a breach in security
occuisfrequently —- either because nobody has the time to make sure it
doesn’t or because nobody cares to make the system work.

The escort system, if supplemented in the Towers by desk attendants
like those in the quad dorms, can function to adequately control the
traffic in the residence halls.

What we do not need in terms of security is this new plan of the
administration’s, instituted as a cost of $35,000 and the students’
freedom.

We can appreciate that the administration is under pressure from
Harrisburg, from parents,’and from alumni to strengthen the security
of the campus. Our desire for tight security is even more intense.
However, we do not want a half-thoughtout, costly and potentially
worthless security plan foisted upon us by the administration. We
want a security plan which meets our needs without senselessly
infringing upon our mobility.

Column and a Half

BY JOHN METCALFE

If you were present at our last meeting you know
that I consider a recent piece of proposed legislation
by Pittsburgh Council Member John Lynch to_b€ an
example of raving lunacy. He wants to make it illegal
to pick up a hitchhiker in the city.

He claims to be acting on behalf of the victims Of
rape and suchlike crimes. He imagines that crimes of
this general nature are caused by women
hitchhiking. Before I go on, I will digress.‘ _

Politicians are, by their nature, very sensitive to
expressions of public opinion. This is not because
they love you and me more than anyone else does.
but becaue they hold their offices by election, and the
public is allowed to vote. When politicians get
letters, they read them, or at least get their staff
members to read them. They probably assume that
every constituent who bothgrs to write represents a
few hundred who did not write but think in much the

” same ways. If you disapprove of the prohibition of

thumbing, write to Mr. Lynch. Better yet, find out
who the candidates for November’s Councilmanic
election are, and write to ask them their views on the
subject.

Back to the subject. Mr. Lynch is swimming
upstream, as salmon are known to do at certain
seasons. He proposes that the law discourage the
sharing of private automobiles, however informal, at
a time when the one-passenger car is on the point of
choking the city’s streets all the way to death. He
wishes to eliminate an alternative form of
transportation at a time when the Administration of
the city is busy crippling any proposal for working
mass transit which comes its way. (Write to him.)

Last October, in this column, I got to worrying
about hitchhiking--not about its safety, but about its
efficiency. The efficiency is awful. I will quote
myself:

“Hitchhiking in the city was always a handy way to
get around...Getting to Pitt is fairly simple; a large
fraction of the traffic in the city seems to pass
through Oakland...getting home is another trip
altogether. I

“When I raise my thumb and a driver stops, some
information is exchanged, but not enough. He knows
I want a ride, but not where I want to go. I know he’s

willing to help me along, but not where he’s going...

“Here comes the proposal.

“I suggest that somewhere on campus, possibly in
front of the Hillman Library or along the driveways at
both ends of the Student Union, a series of signs be
posted. They would indicate general areas of the

city, with emphasis on the sections with the highest _

student concentrations.

“(These would be easy to identify in a
computerized institution. Just ask the computer for a
breakdown of the student population by zip-code
areas.)

“Drivers would know where prospective passen- ‘

gers wanted to go, and students could solicit rides in
a dignified and restful manner, without the athletic
waving and cursing the current system demands.”
I have quoted a lot of last year's article because the
idea is still pretty good. I had thought so all along,
but an Associated Press story last month convinced
me. Here it is: J
“Edmonton, Alberta (AP) -- »
“Hitchhiking is legal in this city if one stays on the
sidewalk, but motorists say that an outstretched

thumb doesn’t provide much information for them. I

“The thumb indicates that a ride is sought, the city
council was told, but not where to.

“So the council agreed to a request by the students
council of the University of Alberta to help solve the
problem and approved the establishment of two
‘hitchhiking’ zones near campus.

“The zones are to have individual signs naming
various districts in the city. A person seeking a ride
to a certain district merely posts himself underneath
the appropriate sign.”

I do not seek praise for anticipating this
development in the wilds of Canada, thdugh I will
accept it. lam using the news story as an illustration
to the fact that thumbing is a valid form of urban
transit.

It won’t be easy, but I will try to ignore actions by
our civic politicians which work against hitchhiking.

More than that, I will not mention the fact that our
student government, supported by the fees we are all
required to pay, has done nothing about my
suggestion of a year ago. If our city is more
backward than Edmonton, Alberta, why shouldn’t
our SG be even more torpid?

Abortion

Dear Editor:

In order for anyone to come to a
rational, well-grounded decision on
abortion, both sides must be heard,
including pro-life. Before charges
are leveled that pro-life unfairly
pushes morality, we state what we
do is exercise our right of free
speech (which in our case includes
a moral point of view). How often
pro-abortionists forget that they
advocate their own moral point of
view!

In line with a “dying woman
petitioning an unsympathetic
legislator” vignette‘, attempted
evocations of septic abortion
image-collages are occasionally
made, trying to crudely convince
the public that there is safety and
humaneness in a jiffy-quick,
economical (???) abortion with
white-frocked attendants rather

Here new-found validity products,
irrationality’s children at their
best, stumble about trying to
hoodwink the public.

The Council of the Royal College
of Obstetricians and Gynaecolo-
gists in Great Britain, on March 26,
1966, unanimously made the
“Those
without specialists’ knowledge,
and these include members of the
medical profession, are influenced

in adopting what they regard as a’

humanitarian attitude to the
induction of abortion by_ failure to
appreciate what is involved. They

tend to regard induction of abortion '

as a trivial operation, free from
risk. In fact, even to the expert
working in the best of conditions,
the removal of an early pregnancy
after dilating the cervix can be
difficult, and is not infrequently
accompanied. by serious complica-
tions. This is particularly true in
the case of the woman pregnant for
the ﬁrst time. For women who
have a serious medical indication
for termination of pregnancy,
induction of abortion is extremely
hazardous and its risks need to be
weighed carefully against those

I involved in leaving the pregnancy. _
Even for the relatively healthy

W0m_8n. however. the dangers are
considerable.’ ’ -

In the respectable British med.
ical Journal “Lancet” (Dec. 4,
1971), Stallworthy, Walsh, and
Moolgaoker commented on the
earl)’ Physical complications of
legally induced abortion: “The
incidence of the complications
described  the severity of some
of them are disquieting. Some may
claim that termination of preg.
nancy is much safer in their hands.
If 509 they are to be congratulated.
The Present ﬁgures represent the
combined experience of five
consultants and a serious of

experienced lecturers, senior re-
gistrars, and registrars. It is
perhaps signiﬁcant that some of
the more serious complications
occurred with the most senior and
experienced operators. This
emphasizes that termination of
pregnancy is neither as simple nor
as safe as some advocates of
abortion-on-demand would have
the public demand.... Septicemia,
peritonitis, and paralytic ileus are
potentially fatal complications, and
the risk of death increases if they
occur after the patient is dis-
charged from hospital and there is
delay in diagnosis.”

Julius Fogel, psychiatrist-
obstetrician, who admits to having
performed hundreds of abortions,
remarked (from: “A Psythological
View of Abortion”. A Commentary

by Colmin McCarthy. St. Paul
Sunday Pioneer Press. From the
“Washington Post”, March 7,

1971): “Abortion is an impassion-
ed subject.... Psychologically and
emtionally we are only beginning to
learn something of its effects on

, the women involved. I think every

woman -- whatever her age, her
background, or sexuality -- has a
trauma at destroying a pregnancy.

destroys a pregnancy; she is
destroying herself. There is no way
it can be innocuous.”

Although not claiming mental
illness follows an abortion, he
adds: “Often the trauma may sink
into the unconscious and never
surface in the woman’s lifetime.
But it is not as harmless and casual
event as many in the pro-abortion
crowd insist. A psychological price
is paid. lcan’t exactly say what. It
may be alienation, it may be a

abortoriums are not the prestigious

Truly, why should a girl have to

Unions Vie for Position

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

(Editors Note: This is the second
in a two part story dealing with the
two unions (AAUP and PPU)
bidding ‘for recognition as the
bargaining agent for the faculties
of the University.)

“It will be at least seven or eight
months,” according to Van Beck
Hall, before a union can be selected
as a" bargaining agent at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Hall, professor of history and
president of the Pitt Professors
Union (PPU), attributes this to the
lengthy process involved in or-
ganizing the initial vote of the
bidding unions.

The PPU is preparing to send out
another mailing sometime next
week with questionnaire cards
enclosed, hoping that more faculty
members will be responsive.

When 30% of the faculty have
returned the cards indicatingtheir
desire to have a union represent
them, the Commonwealth Labor
Relations Board will vote to
determine the bargaining agent.

Hall commented that the PPU
has “gone a little more than
half-way” to that goal, with 17% of
the faculty cards received to date.

Right now, Hall says, the PPU is
primarily interested in going to the
Labor Board with cards of the
mandatory 30%.

“There are a whole series of
problems within the University that
must be worked out,” Hall
explained, “and this is such a
lengthy process that many issues
may change in the next seven or
eight months.”

Hall expressed concern for the
young faculty members who have
not received tenure. “And we’re

Dr. Van Beck Hall

interested in TA’s and TF's--we’re
disturbed that they haven’t re-
ceived pay raises.”

Hall wasn't concerned as was
AAUP President Ray Richman,
over the Law School vote to act as a
separate unit.

“Separating the Law School
won’t make very much difference

in terms of forming a strategy,” he’

explained. “It makes no difference
to me.”

Another time problem involved
in unionization, Hall added, is the
right of the University to appeal the

case when it passes the Common- ‘

wealth Labor Regulations Board.
Temple University is currently
involved in this kind of legal suit.
Hall feels that the AAUP and the
PPU are both interested in the
same things, namely the power of
the faculty in certain defined areas.
“We need the kind of organiza-
tional background to give us some
leverage in Harrisburg...and to
enforce the contracts at home.” ‘

Righl—io-Know Bill

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

‘Urban colleges have always had
more problems than their rural
counterparts, especially in trans-
porting their student to and from
the campus area.

From the days Pitt was known as
the “streetcar college”, Pitt
students have complained of

' lengthy hours on buses and wasted
. time spent at transfer points.

In a step towards a greater

 awareness of student’s needs, the

Port Authority Transit System

_ “ . (PAT), in cooperation with the
‘ ‘University has just inaugurated a

new transit program for the
Oakland area.

According to 'a PAT spokesman,
“The plan has been devised to

develop an effective transit pro-,

gram speciﬁcally for commuters
traveling into the Oakland section.

He added,“If more people were
to take advantage of the new

'0 system, it would not only ease

traffice congestion, but would also
cut down the pollution level in the
area.”

The new plan has been called the

Ohio Valley, McKnight Road,

Students from those areas will
avoid the congestion of downtown

quicker service to their destination.

agreement was a payroll deduction

agencies will come before the legislature again this fall.

Supporters of the right-to-know bill say there is wide spread backing
for the measure which would open the doors of most government
agencies to the public. The bill is ready for final consideration by the
House. '

HOwever, the influence of some opponents may delay final House
passage and Senate sentiment is still uncertain.

The bill would stiffen an open meeting law which sent into effect in
1957. The new legislation covers “every element of government I
could think of,” according to chief sponsor James W. Knepper.

could take place at a meeting that was closed or where public

Valerie is telling me about working
in London--the atmosphere and the
actors.

She is saying that actors in
London are “not so wrappd up in
their stardom...but more involved
in their love for the profession.”
She is telling me of a young
people's theather group directed
by Lawrence Olivier, and a
discussion group in which Vanessa
Redgrave and amateur actors Ieam
together.

Rick and Valerie are agreeing
that “children in America are not
offered as much good theater" as
in London. Valerie explains that
when children are offered “good
theater" they are very receptive to
it, and very vocal in their
criticisims: “that's how children
are--y'know". I

Rick and Valerie, along with the
rest of the Godspell cast, are in
town for their month long
appearance at the Nixon. I ask Rick
who they play in Godspell. He

Sen. Schweiker Opposes
Minimum Wage Bill Veto

PITTSBURGH AP -- U.S. Sen.
Richard Schweiker, R-Pa., said
today he will join congressional
efforts to override President
Nixon's veto of the minimum wage
bill.

Schweiker told a gathering of
United Electrical. Radio Machine
Workers UE here that. by any
economic tests, the current mini-
mum wage should be increased to
at least $2 an hour.

Nixon has rejected, for what he
said was inflationary reasons, the
measure which would have pro-
vided an immediate increase in the
minimum hourly rate from $1.60 to
$2, with an additional hike in one

year to $2.20.
‘ﬁuching on a variety of economic
issues, Schweiker called for a

“reordering of American priori- .

ties" in order to feed. clothe and
educate Americans first, “before
playing Santa Claus and police for
the world.”

Schweiker’s appearance followed
a sharp attack on the Nixon
administration's domestic track
record by Gov. Milton J. Shapp on
Monday.

Shapp said the current ad-
ministration has produced “the
worst economic, if not social chaos
this nation has experienced since
the depression.”

WASHINGTON AP -- Atty. Gen.
Elliot L. Richardson Tuesday
showed an FBI wiretap report to
senior senators in a move that
could ease the confirmation of
Henry A. Kissinger as secretary of
state.

“Everything worked out smooth-
ly,” said Sen. Clifford P. Case,
R-N.J., one of two members of the
Foreign Relations Committee who
met at the Capitol in late afternoon
with Richardson and his acting
deputy, William D. Ruckelshaus.

Case and the other .-member,
Sen. John Sparkman, D-Ala., said
they planned to present a summary
to the committee on Thursady.
They indicated they did not think it
would alter plans to vote next
Tuesday on Kissinger’s nomination
to succeed William P. Rogers.

Kissinger attended the session,
as did Carl Marcy, the committee
staff director. It lasted close to two
hours.

While declining to discuss the
substance of the report, Case sai
“The question is his {Kissinger’3
role in the process." N

Meanwhile, Sparkman told re-
porters that he did not expect delay
in the vote, tentatively scheduled
by the chairman, Sen.J.W. Ful-
bright. D-Ark., for Tuesday.

Case last week proposed that the
committee take no action on the
Aug. 22 nomination until the FBI
submitted a summary of the
wiretaps reportedly made between

1969 and 1971 with Kissinger’s
acquiescence. Thirteen Nixon
administration officials, including
members of the National Security
Council staff. and four newsmen,
were the targets of the wiretaps.

Kissinger defended the “bug-
ging” as a painful but necessary
step to plug leaks of sensitive
material to the press. He declined
to furnish details.

On Monday, the committee
voted unanimously to seek a
summary of the wiretap infor-
mation from Richardson. The
attorney general agreed.

Three copies were supplied
mid-afternoon Tuesday to Case and
Sparkman, acting as a sub
committee, by J.T. Smith, a Justice
Department official. Then the
senators and Marcy met in private
with Richardson, Ruckelshaus and
Kissinger while a platoon of Capitol
policemen and Kissinger’s body-

guards patrolled the corridors
outside the meeting.
Kissinger and Richardson de-
clined to talk to reporters when
they left the Capitol Building.
The session followed a third day
of testimony from the nominee
during which he assured the
committee that he did not
participate in a plot by White
House “plumbers” to connect the
late President John F. Kennedy to

the 1963 assassination of South"

Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem.

“It is a very dangerous business
for one administration to begin
investigating its predecessor,” he
said.

Fulbright announced after the
3‘/2-hour session that the hearings
will resume Friday with testimony
from public witnesses. The
chairman said Kissinger would be
quizzed again Monday in secret.

  ' Freshman Fall Weekend

“Losing " Experience

BY J 0 ANN PACINELLI

“Something was crawling a-
round outside our cabin all night.”

“It was me.”

I feel like a dope. I never
thought that Freshmen Fall Week-
end would be anything special to
remember, but to be a highlight
myself was never my intention.
Nobody else got lost.

At 4:00 a.m. Saturday morning
while two hundred Pitt freshman

é

campers, wrapped in sleeping
bags, were dreaming of softball
games, “Turkey” skits, and
toasted marshmallows, I had begun
my second hour of wandering in the
wilderness. All I ever found was
cabin 40.

“Where’s cabin 35?”

“I don’t know. I don’t live here.
But if you find out that a party’s
going on, come back and tell me
where it is.”

Camp Kon-oKwee seemed to
need a party every hour, either that
or a sabotage in the pool. And
that’s where I got my watch
broken. Freshman Fall Weekend

cost me fifteen dollars for
aggravation and sour milk.

Still the search continued. I was
tired of falling into ditches and
walking into tress. I wasn’t about
to scream hysterically or sit down
and cry. Now since the stars were
slowly fading from the sky, I had
absolutely no source of light to
guide my way.

5:45 Saturday morning I finally
retired to wait for the sunrise on
the floor of the faculty rest

     

room--this being the warmest spot
within a ten mile radius of the
camp. I settled onto two old chair
cushions, my feet wrapped in paper
towels, and snuggled up to an extra
curtain I found in the lounge.

“What do you think might have
been crawling outside cabin 40 last
night?”

“I don’t know. I don’t live here,
but it could have been me.”

The report of my adventures
brought much laughter and dis-
belief, but the remainder of the
Weekend brought me fun and

friendship.

“".‘:...L..... — - -r . -

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO .

In August the Pitt News revealed
that according to a study by John
Vrana, director of University
Housing, approximately 5,186 stu-
dents live in off-campus housing.
A further breakdown show 2,048
living in the Oakland and Shady-
_s' e area and 3,138 from all other
zip ’codes.

At this time, Tim Ging, president
of the Pitt Tenants’ union, which
acts as a mediator between student
tenants and landlords, noted that
there were fewer students looking
for rentals this year than last--
based on the fact that the Union

   

age the “philanthropic” landlord.

There are many bonafide land-
lords, but the Bureau of Building
Inspection encourages students to
clear any rentals with their office in
the Public Safety Building to make
sure their safety is insured.

When asked if therelare any
further plans for the construction of
more student housing, Ging cited
program suggestions in the discus-
sion stage.

One program, proposed by
Community Action Pittsburgh,
called for an equitable housing
complex to be constructed in
Hazelwood in hopes of reviving the

hadn't received that many inquires
to date.

Ging emphasized that relations
with the five major Oakland
landlords are improving: “We’ve
established‘-',a good relationship

I with one of the landlords, another

has come up with new leases, and
we’re in contact with the other
three.”

According to Ging, one of the
biggest problems encountered by
the off-campus residents is people
who rent out floors in their homes.
“The tenants are not sure of their
rights and live by the lease;
ignorance on both parts makes
things difficult,” he stated.

Sources from the City's Bureau

’of Building Inspection maintain

that the problems that may arise in
the Oakland area are common to
other areas which off-campus
rentals for students.

Zoning is a problem where
over-density is encouraged, as in
the case of the “philanthropic”
landlord whose eagerness for more
rentals sometimes results in safety
regulation violations. A,

community. Port Authority Transit
(PAT) was asked to provide a
shuttle -service from the Hazelwood
to the Oakland area, but they
maintained that if such a service
were created other areas would
soon demand similar service.‘

Another suggestion was the
construction of an apartment

. complex in the Panther Hollow area

to house 30-40 students with the
option to buy an apartment at an
equitable rate. But the question of
who would build the complex
presented a problem.

Ging believes that these ideas
and others must go through a
“series of moves” if they are to be

realized. But what does a
prospective tenant do until
then?

Patrick Kader, a native of Detroit
and a senior majoring in psycho-
logy and art, feels that “persever-
ance”, if nothing else, is needed if
a student is going to find what he
wants.

Kader, who did not seek the
assistance of the Pitt Tenants’
Union, began his search for an
apartment in April. He highlighted
some of his discoveries while
conducting the search.

Kader stated that, as most
students do, he first considered
rental price, secondly the location

transportation to Pitt and other
critical places was considered), and
finally the type of district where the
apartment was located.

“Actually I found apartments in
the East Liberty section to be the
least expensive, but you'd end up
taking a bus in to Pitt. The
cheapest and closest place to Pitt to
rent is in Squirrel Hill. I know kids
who rent 5 whole house at $300 a
month and share the costs, but you
won’t find any to rent in Oakland,”
he said.

He found the most common
practice in the Oakland and
Shadyside areas to be the renting
of floors in homes at about $70-75 a
month if students share the rental
costs.

Kader pointed out: “Of course,
you can always get the luxury
apartments in the Oakland-
Shadyside area with wall-to-wall
carpeting, two bedrooms, and
cheap wood paneling at $300 a
month; but, in most cases you have
to sign a lease, put down a month’s
security payment in advance, and
you aren’t allowed to have any
pets--not even goldfish!”

He maintained that the main
disadvantage to a lease is that it

commits one to a year’s rental,,

usually September to September.

“Most students aren’t around in
April, but if they have a lease they
have to pay the rent anyway. Even
if they sublet they loose money

because since most students aren’t 7
around they have to make deals if

they get a prosepective taker. They
end up losing money,” he stated.

Kader, who now lives in the
Atwood Hilton, wasvasked if there
is any advice he would offer
aspirants: “If they haven’t found
an apartment by now--they pro-
bably won’t find one. The best
time to look is around the middle of
August, unless, of course, they

‘want the luxury apartment. Then

they can just sign a contract in
April.”

Kader added that the security
locks in apartment complexes are
only as good as the people in the
building. “A lot leave the door
open carelessly,” he claimed. He
also warned students to “read the

Wednesday, September 12, l973——THE PITT NEWS——Page 11

lease” carefully, maintaining that
there are many “tricks” involved.

Thomas Young, a senior major-
ing in physics, was originally from
Penn Hills before finding an
off-campus residence to his liking
in Munhall, but it was a long and
problem-ridden search.

Young, who feels a “good
landlord” to be one of the primary
considerations when looking for a
residence, alluded to a situation
which arose while he was living in
Monroeville: “I had a landlord
who wouldn’t do anything. First,
the back steps collapsed and then I
was having problems with the hot
water. My lease stated that if
minor plumbing trouble occurred I
was to take care of it, but any major
problem was the landlord’s re-
sponsibility. ’ ’

Young sought help from the Pitt
Tenants’ Union which referred him
to “Allegheny County Health
Department Rules and Regula-
tions.” “The rules stipulated that
plumbing was the landlord’s
responsibility, but when I showed
him the book he told me I was out
of my mind and that it was not his
responsibility. I then contacted the
Health Department which sent
representatives within a couple of
days. They got some things done,
but I finally left the place because
of ﬁnancial reasons,” he stated.

‘Pill Student--Tenants, Landlords--Money

Young recommends that-a tenant
having difﬁculty contact the Health
Department and read its rules and
regulations. “What they should
know is that a lease is often
over-ridden by Health Department

rules, as in my case,” he
emphasized.
After leaving Monroeville,

Young searched for a residence as
close to both Pitt and his place of
employment in West Mifflin as
possible. He noted: “You can
often get a whole house for much
less than an apartment in Oakland
if you share rental costs.” He

 spotted a house in Swissvale with

three bedrooms and thought he
would get someone to live with
him, but upon inquiry he learned
that the landlord wanted a married
couple or women residents--not
single males--thinking they
wouldn’t “keep the place up.”
Young then looked in the papers.
He found most residences to be
either furnished or unfurnished;
very few were semi-fumished with
a stove and refrigerator. He finally
settled in an unfurnished house in
Munhall, conveniently 15 minutes
away from both school and work, at
$150 a month.
“I have a good landlord who
‘takes care of everything. It makes
a big difference!” he concluded.

Landlords that rent floors of houses like this one sometimes rent only to

women or marrieds.

Rights Awareness Seminar

“Seminar on Student Tenants‘
Rights and Responsibilities” is the

, title of a program sponsored by the

Tenants’ Union. The seminar will
be presented on Thursday, Sept. 13
from noon to 4 p.m. in the
Kurtzman Room of the Student
Union. The purpose of the seminar
is to-make student tenants aware at
the beginning of the term of their

M rights and responsibilities and how

to execute them. Many problems
occur simply because people are
not aware of how to handle a
situation.

Tim Ging, chairman of the
Tenants’ Union, says of the
seminar, “It‘s an opportunity for
students to get any problems

i answered at one time. If they don't

have problems, we can give
students information to keep it that
way."

The Tenants’ Union has ar-

ranged for many guests to appear.
The guests include officials from

’ the Sheriff’s Department to speak
— on evictions and lockouts,

and
representatives from the Board of

Health and Bureau of Building

Inspections to inform about illegal
apartment conditions, violations of
the health code, and the enforce-
ment of the statutes. The attorneys
that the Tenants’ Union keeps on
retainer will also be there.

Printed material on tenant

problems will be available free of
charge.

that two quite separate museums
occupy the Carnegie Institute
building and that their membership
in the Institute helps support two of
this country’s major museums.
Dr. M. Graham Netting, Director

of Carnegie Museum of Natural’

History, explained further that
since 1895 the Museum has
become widely known in many
countries, initially through the
presentation to ten national
museums of replicas of Diplodocus,
the first giant dinosaur to be
excavated and erected for public
viewing, and subsequently through
scientific studies carried out by the
staff in many parts of the world,
and reported upon in international
publications.

The research activities of the
museum covers in a broad way the
entire field of natural history,
including anthropology in all its
subdivisions such as archeology
and ethnology. For the local
museum-goer, however, the name
Carnegie Museum can be confus-
ing, and it is not unusual for the
general public to call Carnegie
Museum for information concern-
ing art, without realizing that the
Museum of Art is a separate
museum at Carnegie Institute. It is
therefore in the interests of clarity
and better public service that the
Board of Trustees has decided to
enlarge the name Carnegie
Museum by adding “of Natural
History” to the official title.

Bullet Extends Touring  

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
will bring its productions to over a
dozen cities during the 1973-74
season. This will mark its first
extended touring engagement.
After opening its new season here
at Heinz Hall October 12, 13 and 14
with three performances of Pro-
koﬁev’s “Cinderella”, the com-
pany will pack a varied assortment
of props, scenery and costumes and
begin its out of town appearances
at the University of Delaware. The
company wil perform Cinderella
during a one-half week residence
under the NEA Residence Touring
Program. In addition it will give
master classes and lecture’ de-
monstrations. Three additional
residencies under the NEA spon-
sorship will take the company to
Detroit, Michigan; Fredonia and
Binghampton, New York.

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
rather unique offerings of full
length classics make it desirable to
a large number of communities.
For instance, Romeo and Juliet will

be performed twice in Slippery
Rock and twice in Indiana, Pa.;
twice in Detroit and once in Terre
Haute, Indiana; Nutcracker twice
in Buffalo, New York, once in Mt.
Lebanon, etc. The company is also
touring with other selections from
their wide repertory. The
extensive touring is scheduled in
between the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre performances at Heinz
Hall. The popularity of Nutcracker
has made it necessary to augment
to seven the number of perform-

ances at Heinz Hall during the
Christmas season; they are sched-
uled for December 27, 28, 29
matinees and evenings and Decem-
ber 30 matinee.

Tickets for all Heinz Hall
performances are on sale at Heinz’
Hall box office. A number of
subscriptions are still available by
contacting the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre new offices at 244
Boulevard of the Allies or phoning

Explorer to Lecture

Mr. Stanton Waterman, a noted
explorer and photographer, will
present his ﬁlm about Polynesia at
Carnegie Music Hall, Carnegie
Institute, on September 23, 1973.
The film, “The Call of the Running
Tide,” is his record of the year he,
his wife and three children spent
living in the French Polynesian

islands. He narrates the events
himself and accompanies his
widely acclaimed photography with
an original music score containing
recorded music from the islands.

Mr. Waterman is best known for
his full-length ﬁlm, “Blue Water-
White Death”.

 Dl‘ClmCl Therapy Workshop

Volunteers are being sought for a
drama therapy workshop, or-
ganized by Franklyn Wepner, a
graduate student in the School of
Social Work.

According to Wepner, volunteers
need not have experience in the
arts or therapy to participate in the
program, although such experience
would be useful.

The techniques to be used in the
workshop include environmental
theater methods of Jerszy
Grotowski, director of the Polish
Laboratory Theater; hatha yoga
and chaotic breathing meditation
music, theater, and .dance im-
provization; and verbal and
nonverbal group dynamics.

Wepner, 32-year-old long-term
student with a background in
science, education, therapy, music,
and theater, is uniquely qualified
for conducting such a project.

Consultants to Wepner for the
workshop will be Alvin Landy,
MSW professor of Social Work at
Pitt, Dr. Eleanor Irvin, a thera-
peutic activities worker at the

Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center,

Dr. Richard Mennen, a theater arts

professor at Pitt, and Dr. William

Borrero, a psychiatrist.

The positions of his four
consultants in this project, says
Wepner, are symbolic since they
represent a bringing together of

the duties of social worker, arts
therapist, theater director, and
psychiatrist which in tribal times
were all performed by the shaman,
or medicine man.

Those interested in participating
in Wepner’s workshop may call I
him between 9 and 11 p.m. at
681-1019 or write to him at 745 S.
Millvale Avenue, Pittsburgh 15213.

THE 1974 OWL STAFF invites all those per-

sons interested in working on this year's

Yearbook to come to a General Meeting on
Thursday, September 13th, at 8:00 p.m. in
Room 400 Schenley Hall. We need typists,
writers, photographers and layout and design
help. Everyone is welcome to join the staff.

Old Times Scheduled For Revival at Foster

ARTS EDITOR

EDITOR’S NOTE: This review is
a reprint of an article that appeared
in the June 5, 1973 edition of the
Pitt News. The revival perform-
ances of Old Times are scheduled
for Sept. 13, 14, and 15 at the
Stephen Foster Theatre. For more
information, contact the theatre
Dept, Univ. of Pittsburgh.

Gillette Elvgrin once studied
theatre arts in London, and during
the course of these studies, he was
fortunate enough to view one of the
first productions of Pinter’s Old
Times. After the performance, he
realized that the man sitting in the
next seat was Harold Pinter

production of Old Times, currently
showing at.Stephen Foster, I might
go as far as to say that a little bit of
Pinter must ,have 1 rubbed off
during that evening--Old Times is
excellent.

Strange, that I should open this
review with a memory, for that is at
the center of Old Times--memories.

The hazy, half-faded memories we
tend to hold, dead though they be,
as sustance for life in the present.

The story itself is quite simple.
Anna (Mary Robb Jackson) comes
to visit ex-roommate Kate (Julie
Quinio) after 20 years. In the
interim, Kate has married a man
named Deely (Daniel Chodos).

When Anna arrives, a subtle
struggle ensues--both husband and
old friend vie for the Kate they
once knew, a sensual, dreamy girl
who now appears unaffected by the
obvious wooing of her attentions.
Their tale is always of how she was
and at one point, Kate remarks that
they speak of her as though she
were dead. As the drama unfolds,

JULIE QUINIO portrays Kate and Daniel Chodos portrays Deeleyin the Uni-
versity Theatre production of Harold Pinter’s Old Times.

we see that memories are not what
they appeared to be.

Pinterian drama, especially Old
Times, is a subtle interplay, not
only of conversational communica-
tion, but of physical communica-

characters talk around, through, at,
and over each other. What they
say is not necessarily what they
meant.

This presents special problems
for the director and actor. Both
must be sure that the true meaning
of the dialogue becomes clear
through these minute gestures,
pauses, and expressions. Elvgrin
and his cast have handled these
aspects quite well.

Chodos and Jackson are fine in
their run around mono and
dialogues. The pauses and
innuendoes are perfectly timed-—

situation becomes more and more

Heyman. And, as I praise the

All in all, Elvgrin has achieved a
complete impact through his
meticulious direction of Old Times.
I think that had Pinter been sitting
in the audience opening night, he
would have been very pleased.

“This is a venture into the
unkown,” said the coach, describ-
ing Saturday’s Pitt-Georgia football
game. Contrary to the immediate
conclusion one would reach, those
aren’t the words of Johnny Majors.

_hat was Vince Dooley, the
‘ ‘eorgia coach talking, and he’s not
expecting the game to be an easy
victory. “A new opponent with a
new coach is double trouble,” he
added, referring to the fact that the
two schools will be facing each
other for the ﬁrst time. p

Not to be undone, Majors
replied, “It’s more of venture into
the unknown for me than it is for
him. At least he knows what his
team can do.”

The occasion was the ﬁrst of the
weekly Pitt football luncheons held
yesterday at Frankie Gustine’s
Holiday Inn in Greentree. Majors
spoke in person to the members of

“The enthusiasim worries me,”
admitted Dooley. Pitt’s a well

' coached team, and we don’t know

anything about their recruits.”

It doesn't sound like the coach of
a heavily favored team talking, but
that is what the Bulldogs will be
when they take the ﬁeld Saturday.

Many of those new recruits will
be seeing action in the ‘ game,
according to Majors. “We’ll play
as many people as we can,” he
said, citing two reasons for that
strategy. “First, the heat is going’
to take its toll, and second, we need

referring to the many freshman and
junior college transfers who will
probably be making the trip.

Majors can instill fear into the
loyalest of Pitt rooters as he
explains the plusses Georgia has
going for it. “Their staff has been
together for ten years,” he stated.
Georgia is in the Southeastern
Conference, and even though
they’re not picked to win it, they’ll
be real strong. There are -a lot of
tough teams in that conference,
and there are about six contenders
for the title. They are the biggest

southern team I’ve seen.”

Their main strength lies with the
defense, he went on. “Their front
four people are all experienced,
and their linemen are big. People
do not run up and down the field on
Georgia.”

Commenting on the strengths
and weaknesses of the Panthers,
Majors said, “We need good
people in the “skill” positions to
break some plays for touchdowns.
That’s the only way to win. You
need strength up front to establish
the attack, but it takes speed to get
that long pass or running play.”

Majors has no way of knowing
how good or bad his charges are at
this point. “lt’s like not being able
to see the forest because of all the
trees,” he analogized, pointing out
that when you play yourself, you
don’t know if the offense is good
and the defense is bad, or
vice-versa.

When you ﬁrst meet him, Ray
Rex seems like a very easy-going
type of guy, but you couldn’t prove
it by his performance on the soccer
ﬁeld.

“When I get on the playing field,
I get really intensely involved in the
game and in what I'm supposed to
be doing,” says Rex, “and once
the game starts the soccer ﬁeld is
may whole world, with nothing else
to distract me.”

It's this intensity, plus Ray’s

great speed and experience that_

convinced Coach Bemis to convert
him from the wing position to plug
up the hole left by Gary Midock,
the heart of the Panther defense
last year.

Ray Rex does not see himself as
just a replacement and does not
feel that he is there to fill Midock’s
shoes.

“I don’t look at it that way,”
says the Fox Chapel High alumnus.

“I think that with my speed and
overall experience that I can be
making a great contribution to the
team." ~

The transition from _wing to
defense will not be exactly smooth,
especially with the lack of practice
the Panther booter has had, but
Ray has a lot of help near the goal.

“It’s also nice to know you have
a good goalie behind you,” admits
the letterman, “but the way I try to
play is that I want to be able to stop
as many of the opposition’s attacks
on goal as I can and take that
pressure off Bill Haines.”

“It’s also a matter of pride,
“says the elder of the Rex
brothers. “I would also like to have
a shot at having the least number of
goals scored against us this season,
and that’s a job for the whole
defense. I want to be an important
part of that.”

This is Ray’s last year of varsity
soccer and he has a few
reservations about that. Although
he would like to continue playing
after -his senior year, his plans for
law school won’t let him do that.

“I really love the game and wish
I could play it more, ifjust to stay in
shape." Rex comments, “butthe
only thing is that my schedule for
the years to come won't let me.”

Ray is disturbed by the attitude
towards soccer in this country and
of the lack of enthusiasm for it.

“I don’t see why we can’t pack

When Johnny Majors and Co.
took over the fate of Pitt football
last winter. a lot was said about the
leftovers from last season's 1-10
squad. Majors brought with him a
lot of new faces and there was wide

. speculation that quite a few of the

old faces on the Pitt squad weren't
going to be seen.

But Majors knew that a total
change of personell wasn’t going to
bring immediate victory. Last
year’s Pitt team did have talent
into this year's
program. Stan Ostrowski is a
perfect example.

Last season Ostrowski was Pitt's
leading rusher with 514 yards in

 140 attempts. From his backﬁeld
1 spot. he ran for three touchdowns

and hauled in 18 passes for 255

A yards and on TD.

In drills last spring, it was
obvious that his days as a running
back had ended with that disas-
terous season but it was also

evident that he was not expendable

regime. Ostrowski had the look of
the natural athlete, the football
player. He was going to play for
Pitt and the new coaching staff
didn’t waste time finding the right
position to suit his abilities.

good hands make him a quarter-
back’s delight to throw to and his
running experience will come to

light after he pulls in the ball.

“Playing tight end? Yeah, it’s
all right." Ostrowski said through a
half smile. “You always like to
carry the ball. This just means I
won't be getting it that much. As
long as I'm playing..."

Actually, his pass catching days
began back at Canon McMillan
High where he was one of the
outstanding backs in Western
Pennsylvania. Besides being
named to the AP and UPI All-State

combination to acquire
picture-perfect touch.

“It's just a matter of getting
used to Bill or anybody else that is
there," the senior. two year
letterman remarked. “Eventually
I'll get used to them."

One thing to remember is the
difference between a tight end and
a wide receiver. Ostrowski’s
primary patterns won’t take him on
a fly the length of the ﬁeld. His
size and strength, along with his
ability to find the ﬂoating opening
in the defensive secondary will be
the things to look for.

“My patterns are basically
crossing over from one side of the

ﬁeld to the other and delays,"="-:7

don‘t have too many patterns.”

Another responsibility delegated
to any tight end is the routine
blocking of a lineman. Ostrowski
has put on some extra pounds since
spring and feels that he ﬁts the bill.

“I’ve put on 15 pounds since last
year and I feel a lot stronger,” he
claimed. “My blocking’s improved
since camp and Coach Roper has
been teaching me a lot.”

Ostrowski will have quite a time?»

with the Georgia Defensive secon-
dary. one of Bulldogs strongest
points. At 6-2 and a solid 205
pounds, Pitt won't be giving much
if any size away.

“We believe that we won’t beat
Georgia in any one particular
method," Ostrowski said, his tone
now drifting into the uttermost
depths of seriousness, “but we do
believe that we’ll beat them and
that's something important; be-
lieving in yourself.
what we do here."

Jackie Sherrill was idly talking
with a bystander in one of the Pitt
Stadium endzones Monday night.
In a smooth continuous motion, his
left hand was twirling his coaching
whistle. From his right hand,
Sherrill was drinking .a cold can of
7-Up."

Football practice had just ended
and so had the conversation. Now,
Sherrill was making his way into
the coach’s locker room. His
whistle never missed a twirl, but
the empty can of Uncola was no
longer in existance--it had been
reduced to a mangled mass of
twisted aluminum by Jackie’s
strong right hand.

Since being named Assistant
Head Coach and Defensive Co-
ordinator on John Majors’ football
coaching staff in January, 21 lot of
stories have been circulated about
Jackie Sherrill. They all conclude
that he is a mean man.

With this in the back of his mind,
a certain writer instinctively
cleared his throat as he prepared to
confront Sherrill one-on-one for the
first time to ask him if he was
mean. V

The coach’s face lit up with the
doggondest, friendliest southern
smile ever to be seen in Pittsburgh
when the question was posed.

Jackie Sherrill   Isn’t Mean

“No,” Sherrill said, “I’m not
mean.
“I didn’t take the easy way out

growing up. I have always believed '

in dedication and hard work,” he
solemnly said, his face reverting
back to its serious appearence--an
appearance which has apparently
fed fuel to the rumors of meaness.
“I’m tough, but I’m not mean.__
The 135 or so athletes, who have

been associated with Sherrill since ,

his arrival, will readily agree that
he is tough.

And, when Sherrill says that he
didn’t take the easy way out, he is
telling the truth. For, Sherrill
played his college football at
Alabama, for George ‘Bear’
Bryant.

Sherrill began his amazingly
successul football career at Biloxi
High School in Mississippi, where
he gained All-State selection and
honorable mention to the high
school All-American team. At
Biloxi High, Sherrill also player on
two scholastic Shrimp Bowl
Games--games which pitted two of
the South’s best high school teams
against each other. .

From there, Sherrill enrolled at
Alabamaiand played on the 1964
and 1965 National Championship
teams. During his stretch with the
Crimson Tide, Sherrill played in
the 1964 Sugar Bowl, the 1965

Orange Bowl, and captained his

, team’s 29-28 win over Nebraska in

the 1966 Orange Bowl.
Sherrill began his coaching
career as a graduate assistant

' under Bryant after graduation and

moved to Arkansas in 1967. He
joined Majors at Iowa State in ‘68
and was promoted to Assistant
Head Coach and Defensive Co-
ordinator in 1970. ‘

Ironically, it was while Sherrill
was a scholastic star at Biloxi that
he first got to know Majors.

“Coach Majors was an assistant
at Mississippi State and he came to
my home to recruit me,” Sherrill
remembered with a widening grin.
“But I didn’t go with him because
my brother was at Alabama and the
Tide was the No. 1 team in the
country then. Alabama also had
Bear Bryant.”

. By not recruiting Sherrill, Majors
missed out on a real blue chipper.
In his collegiate‘ career, Sherrill
played seven different positions--a
thing unheard of in college football
‘today. In his first three varsity
games at Alabama, Sherrill played
offensive and defensive end,
fullback, tailback, center, line-
backer, and nose guard.

“One day ‘Bear’ came to me and
asked me ifl could play tight end,”
Jackie recalled. “I told him I would
try. He said that he knew that, but
that he wanted to know If I would,
not could.” 7 .

The next game found Sherrill
playing tight end. Because of this
versitility, Sherrill was quite a story
at Alabama.

“I remember when a newspaper
did a story on me. They had a
picture of me with seven-jerseys
laying around my feet. . I was

standing there hold the ‘quarter-
back’s jersey and the caption with
the picture was a big question-
mark,” Sherrill said. A
got

Jackie never that job,

because a man by the name of Joe
Namath was seeing to that.
However, Namath and Sherrill
became good friends.

“Joe was really a great guy,”
Sherrill says of the New York Jet
sensation. “You know, Joe wasn't
the wild guy they pegged him out
to be. He was well behaved in
bars."

Had Namath not been there,
Sherrill could probably have done
the QB job, because he seems to
know so much about how to stop
them. His defensive platoons at
Iowa State were second in the
nation, over a five year (1968-1972)
period, in causing turnovers. The

Cyclone defense caused 203 turn»

overs in that stretch and’ in 1971
alone they forced 50 mistakes--a
4.4 average per game. ‘

“It takes a different type of
athlete to play defense,” Sherrill
noted. “It takes a mentally
tougher person. On offense you
can make it through a year without
injuries. Not so on defense.

“I think there's a possibility that
we can have a good defensive team

 

   
   

COACH JACK SHERRILL paces his troops during preseason camp

this year. I guarentee you we will
play with pride andenthusiasm and
that we will chase the ball. If a
player doesn’t do this,” Sherrill
said, “he will be fired and someone
else will be put in there.

“I haven’t watched last year’s
game films and I think it’s helped
me in «formulating my opinions of
the athletes on what they have
done in front of me. That’s why

keep proving himself every day.

“The most important thing for us
though will be to remain sound,”,
he said.

How would Sherrill react if‘ his
defense gave up 30 or 40 points to j ,3
Georgia? “I would be highly
disappointed. ’ ’

Sherrill further disproved his
meaness by admitting that football
should be fun.

“You’ve got to have fun playing
football. If you don’t win, it’s no
fun and the only way to win is by
surrounding yourself with winners
and by being tough. There is a
difference between being tougli,§,, ;,
and being mean. ‘3 I ll
