Turner, reading a prepared
statement, cited personal reasons
beyond her control that would limit
her time for SGB activities.
, resignation is due to
-"personal family reasons which will
require my time for the next two
months,” Turner said. “It is not a
reflection on the newly elected
board or President Barry Weis-
band.” A

She said she planned to spend as .

much time as possible working with

Student Government after the
two-month period.
According to Weisband, the

Board will accept applications until

Student leaders demandedmore
student input in the beginning
stages of administrative decision-
making at yesterday's Student
Affairs Advisory Council (SAAC)
meeting.

Re"ident Student Association
(RSA) Chairman Marty Doerfler
..§;ited recent controversy over the
-residence hall housing contract as
one area in which students should
have more input.

“We were initially given only the
power to work on rewarding of the
contract after it was already drawn
up by the Housing Office,"
Doerfler said. “We could only

Five of the six remaining Board
members must agree on who will til
the vacant SGB seat.

Also at last night’s meeting, the‘
SGB turned down an Allocations
Committee recommendation to
reject a budget modiﬁcation for
funding of the engineers’ Sham-

rock Ball.

The budget modification ‘re-
quested $742 be transferred from
other engineering programming
activities to offset the cost of the
Shamrock Ball, scheduled for the
Red Winds Room at the Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport.

The engineers’ funding request
already has been returned to the
Allocations Committee twice this
year, and according to the SGB
Constitution, the Board cannot
return it a third time.

“At this point, the Board has the
power to approve the budget
modiﬁcation or can make a ﬁnal
rejection,” Weisband said.

Discussion on the engineers’
request was tabled until an

adverse to our concerns.”
Doerﬂer mentioned speciﬁcally a

clause in the contract that failed to -

outline explicitly the responsibili-
ties of the University to the
resident.

Vice Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joe Dutton said the
University's obligations to the
resident were outlined in a
pamphlet distributed to all resident
students and did not have to be
outlined explicitly in the contract.

Doerfler said the RSA was

planning to institute a committee to
work withthe Housing Ofﬁce to
discuss further student input into

The University Housing Ofﬁce ‘

has set a limit of 2,200 upperclass-
men who will be able to return to
the dormitories next year but
expects no problems in accomodat-

ing students who wish to return in-

the fall.

The unprecedented move was_a
result of last fall’s unexpected
heavy demand for housing that
forced the Housing Ofﬁce to place
students at the Webster Hall Hotel,
Carlow College and Point Park
College.

“Last year really caught us off
guard, and this plan is an effort to
avoid that happening again,” a
Housing Ofﬁce spokesman said.

. “We never know how many
‘students will seek housing until
summer,” Jo Ann Gibbs, assistant
director‘ of the Ofﬁce of Residence
Life, said. “We have 3,800 rooms,
but some of them must be reserved
for incoming freshman and relocat-
ed students.” '

The Housing Ofﬁce has never’

received 2,200 applications from
returning residents, but more than

-2, 100 students applied last fall,'and

that number is rising. _
“This plan will beneﬁt both

students and the various ‘offices  If
_ concerned with this matter,” Gibbs I
said. “It will allow the students to

know exactly what their status is
and will gave the Housing Ofﬁce

a better idea of what they’re faced A

’ with. ‘ -
“This issue of space allocation ;

has affected a lot of University. 7

97

offices, she continued, “and has
been widely discussed at many
levels.” '

The Housing Office will keep at

r_unning count of room requests for‘ '_
the .ﬁrst time and reject any-
application received after March 3 ‘
or after the 2,200-student limit’_is_'

reached. _
“Acceptance of the $100 prepay-
ment that must accompany an

application implies the guarantee I

of a room,” Gibbs said, “and we

don’t want to give any false.

impressions.” , P

The Housing Ofﬁce"s oldpolicy  _
was to accomodate every student‘

who wanted housing.

Student Loan Bankruptcies Up

BY DENNIS KELLY

Pennsylvania student loan bank-
ruptcies jumped 254% in 1975,
according to officials at the

‘ Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency.

The number of cases rose from
113 in 1974 to 391 last year, causing
a Congressional subcommittee
investigating the matter to consider
a ﬁve-.year ban on bankruptcy after
a debtor leaves school.

Ofﬁcials at Pitt, however, expect
little will result form the election.

“I don’t think anything will come
of the proposal, at least nothing
punitive for students,” Assistant
Director of Governmental Relations
Lou Tronzo said.

Pitt has ﬁnalized a deal with the
First Trinity Evangelical Lutheran

Alequippa and Morgan Streets

Pitt paid $115,500 for the land

A director of University Legal Ser-

vices. said 6,360 bodies had to be

that the law compels Pitt to

compensate the relatives of the
deceasedfor the necessary reloca-

Both parties agreed on Mt. Royal
Cemetery in Shaler Twp., as the
relocation site, Jackson said.

Jackson said the relocation
process cost $1.5 million. Included
in the sum is $400 paid to the
relatives of each of the deceased.

Other expenses, he said, were
the purchase of 849 new head-

the housing contract and other
related areas.

Doerfler also said students
should have the option of seeing a
budgetary breakdown of the effects
of releasing fres_hman from the
mandatory 19-meal plan.

Doerfler said the Housing Office
had informed the RSA that without

I the mandatory base for freshman,

the food service could not operate.

Dutton said releasing freshman
from them mandatory plan could
result in higher prices for the food‘
service. - _

‘‘I’d like the students to be able
to make the judgement of what is
most equitable,” Doerﬂer said.

Student Government President
Barry Weisband also requested
more student input in the initial-
stages of the decision-making
process, speciﬁcally in the areas of
tuition and budgetary planning.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar count-
ered that students have members
on the standing committees of the
University Senate, including the
Senate Budget Policies Committee,
which deals with University budget
procedures.

Posvar said in the event of a
tuition hike due to a low state
appropriation, students would be
briefed on all options. V

“It’s impossible to say if there
will be a tuition hike at this time,”
Posvar said. “It depends on the
appropriations from the state.”

Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs William Markus
said it would be premature to
discuss a tuition hike until the
availability of state funds is known.

STABBIN G SUSPECTS GRABBED

PITTSBURGH (AP)—-Police ar-.

rested two Pittsburgh men Tuesday
in the death of a man who was
stabbed and thrown from a
downtown parking garage.

Charged with murder were
Charles J. Goldblum, 25, and
Clarence Miller, 40. They are
accused of stabbing George Wil-
helm on the eighth floor of the
garage late Monday.

Wilhelm was stabbed repeatedly
with garden shears, police said,
then thrown over a guard rail. He
landed on a ledge one floor down
where his cries for help attracted
garage employes. '

Police did not give a motive for
the slaying, although robbery was

ruled out. The coroner’s office said 6

there was evidence of ‘sodomy
involved.

Greenspan also indicated the
best is yet to come. He said
unemployment could be lower this

"70 -Years of Collegiate Jot_I_rnga/ism at the University of Pittsburgh ”

I Now on to

Harrisburg

The recommendation by Gov. Milton Shapp to cut Pitt’s requested

 state appropriation by "nearly $10 million puts the University in an
adversary position similar to last year’s. . _

g g It was only natural that Chancellor Wesley Posvar pledged a

 vigorous campaign at Monday’s Senate Council meeting for increased

-'7-funding from Harrisburg.

.  Spch a campaign must include a cross section of participants——mem-
 bersof the major student groups, faculty and administrators.
" . Coming ‘off last year’s 14% tuition hike, students are particularly

" wary of the parallel circumstances

that may bring about another

:7 increase this year. The only way to satisfy students is to ask them to

I assist in the Harrisburg effort.

L’ 4 This could mean a two-pronged attack.
‘ The governor is more vulnerable to public opinion this

year because

 of his campaign for the presidency. Since he likes to consider himself a
liberal, some sharp criticisrnof his cuts in education may have their

‘. » On the other hand, the University

must reach the members of the

A General Assembly who increased last year’s funding by 12.5% when

"Shapp favored only 3.5%. Since

some legislators derided the

- letter-writing lobby and its end result amounted to nothing, such a

- tactic cannot be repeated.

. Many state legislators, like Shapp, are’ seeking votes this year.
4 Though it’s hard to say at this point how much effect this pressure
could have, it's at least one avenue we didn’t have open last year.
M And" we stand to’ open even more roads of opportunity and pursue
' them all the more successfully if students and faculty, along with the
Chancellor’s task force, could participate in a stepped-up campaign in

_ Harrisburg.

i...And-Their Other Bosses  

BY BILL KALMAN

Throughout the , current unioni-
zation drive, the Pitt Board of
Trustees and the administration
has frantically churned out tons of

Relations Board. has determined

held, anti-union activity-is being

derision or else hint of pity.

What the white lamb thinks no
one knows or cares- As long as
he’s got that brick.

Aline of pledges with the blue
and white crescent around their

, necks traipse in like a pack of

cross-country runners in the middle
_ of a ract. They halt and hail'some
brothers in semi-unison. All that
can be made of the shouted salute
is the last ;?'V'vord'——the dubious and
self-serving: ‘ ‘Incorpor'ate'd.,’ ’

They’re sent outon another job,
perhaps for pizza or something that

‘ requires a troop of errand boys to
even a lesser degree.‘ In a rigorous
train they scamper out—crescents

' pulling at their necks—to do the
bidding of yet one more man.

The lamb sees this out of the
corner of his eye, remaining rigid
and unerring throughout the entire
rite. He will hold the brick until his

. brothers accept him, not as ‘a
master accepts a slave, but as a
man accepts another man.

Yet throughout his well-earned
time as
remember somewhat painfully that
he had to submit to them, to dote
on them, to play nigger to those he
held most high. Just as the-black
man had to be content with
bondage under the whitemaster
for 300 years, so did he have ‘to lick
the boots of someone who just may
have had a desire to impose a
master-slave relationship of his
own and see what it would be like
to own a man, even if he happened
to be a brother. '

When history repeats itself, it,
does so with ever subtle irony.

steppedup. ‘There is one recurring
theme in all the University’s
arguments: Unions areoutsiders,
coming in and telling Pitt employes
what to do. This would destroy the
concept of the “one, big, happy
family” that we enjoy at Pitt. The
University proposes that employes

' work out their problems with other

members of the family.

To understand why the Board of
Trustees constantly uses this
argument and to understand why it -
is fighting tooth and nail against
unions, we must examine the
composition of the Board and the
role it plays in the University.

According to the University of _
Pittsburgh Commonwealth Act, the
job of the Board is to direct “the
entire management, control, and
conduct of the instructional,
administrative, and ﬁnancial af-
fairs of the University.” This is
quite a big job.’ You would think
the people doing this big job would
be democratically elected by the
University community. And since
Pitt is a big, happy family, you
would expect to find equal
representation on the Board for all
sections of the University, includ-
ing faculty and students. But we
all know that this just ain’t so.

The Board of Trustees, which is
the highest policy-making body in
the University, does not represent
the interests of the Pitt faculty,
staff and students. Instead, the
Board represents the interests of
the ruling rich in Pittsburgh: the
bankers, ﬁnanciers and industrial-
ists.

These people are not like us.
They’ do not ride buses, worry
about rent or eat at McDonald’s.
They do not have to experience
over-crowded classrooms, rising
tuition -costs or inﬂation-shrunk
paychecks. If these people are not
like us. then what are they like?

The economicelite who sit on the
Board of Trustees at Pitt also sit on
boards of other, institutions in
Pittsburgh. For example, each of
the 12 charter trustees serves as
director or ofﬁcer on at least one of
50 corporate bodies, including the
Equitable Gas Company, the Scaife
Art Gallery, WQED, Presbyterian
Hospital. Dollar Savings Bank,
Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh
Plate and Glass. the Pittsburgh
Symphony and the Pittsburgh’
Ballet,‘ Mellon Bank, the Pitts-
burgh Regional Planning Associa-
tion. Pittsburgh National Bank and
the Civic Light Opera. I know of no
faculty member or student who
helps rule Pittsburgh as do these
gentlemen. .

Consider ,, for- a moment "the
enormous economic power the
millionaires on the Board wield—-
millionaires like Henry L. Hillman

 
   
 
 

_ among others. .  , '
, ’ .x-. - ' - -. .. \.

(yes. of Hillman Library fame)’, who
is a director of Pittsburgh National
Bank. National Steel Corp., Global
Marine. Inc. and Calgon Corp.,

 
 
 

Millionaires like L; Falk, Jr.,
(director _of Duquesne Light,
National Steel Corp., Pennsylvania
Industrial Chemicals Corp., among
others) and Leslie B. Worthington
(director of Greyhound, U.S. Steel,
-Westinghouse Airbrake and Mel-
lon Bank). The'Chairr_nan of the
Board, William H. Rea, is
president and chairman of the
Oliver Tyrone Corp., as well as
director of -Crucible Steel and
Mellon Bank. ' ~

Then we come to the celebrity on
the Board: Robert R. Dorsey.
Dorsey used to be president of Gulf
Oil and a director of 54 Gulf
subsidiaries in 54 different coun-
tries. That was before the
‘revelations came out about the
millions of dollars in illegal political
bribes that Gulf had spent here and
abroad. In a ﬁne display of

“corporate morality,” Dorsey re- V

signed his position. But as of this
writing, he is still a Board member.
Wonder if Dorsey will keep his seat
on the Board as long as Frank
Mazzei did..'..

These are the people who are on
the Pitt Board of Trustees. And
they couldn't care less about ‘the
legitimate interests of faculty and ’
students. Now let us look at who is
not on the Board.

While capital is amply represen-
ted on the Bo_ard, labor is. not.
There is but one ‘representative
from organized labor out of,36'
trustees. , And he recently
distinguished himself by being the
only Trustee to vote against last
year's tuition hike. '

While administrators are repres-
ented on the Board, faculty and
students are not. Faculty

members, who know far better than '

administrative bureaucrats how a

school should be operated, are I

under direct control of the Board.’
A The Commonwealth Act states,
.“Thc-power of appointment and
the. correlative power of dismissal
of any member of the teaching staff
arc...committed to the Board of
Trustees." Faculty unions would
protect their members from the
arbitrary use of this power.

There are more students at_ Pitt

than there are of anything else, but _

there is no elected student
representative on the Board.
While it is true that Gov. Milton
Shapp created a special student
seat on the Board, it must be noted
that Shapp appoints this person;
students do not democratically
elect their representative. And
students considered for this great
honor are thoroughly screened. so
the most “responsible" are select-
ed.

The overwhelming majority at
Pitt. faculty and students, are ruled
by :1 Board that does not represent

been wondering: Harry Paras did
I _ not die. Here’s the story of his near
demise.

BY HARRY PARAS

After you pay your $580 tuition,
the one thing you don’t want to do
is get sick. But that is what I did.
My suspicion is that “playing” too
hard over Christmas vacation is a
likely culprit.

Three things to watch out for are

 colds, of course, viral infections
._and mononucleosis. Of this lot, I
, came up with mono. But watch out,.

cold (runny nose, cough, sore
throat)just like you. And I doctored
myself with aspirins, nose drops
and Sucrets, and valiantly contin-
ued to go _to school.

After two weeks of walking
around this way, I developed more
symptoms: fever and chills, a
throat so sore it hurt to swallow and
an increased tendency to want to
stay in bed.

A blood test revealed that I did
have mono. The doctor said to me,
“Son, this is no laughing matter, if
you don’t take care of yourself, you
can kiss this term goodbye.” Sick
humor. Fortunately, though, I was
allowed to continue school, as long
as I got plenty of rest.

“Classes took on a new dimen-
sion. Medium-boring classes be-
came incredibly boring, and boring
classes I couldn’t handle. During
one class of only 10 people, I
became feverish and started
sweating. After class, the professor
asked me if I, really thought his
lecture was that exciting, '

Finally, I was ordered to bed. I
was truly an undercover reporter.
Staying in bed for days is usually a
treat, especially when the doctor
relieves all guilt by ordering you
there. But with mono, it’s just no
fun.

I would fall asleep only to wake
up an hour later soaking wet with
sweat. I even smelled sick. Then,

from the Puritan Age. Then it
dawned on me that New Year’s Eve
at midnight must have been the
time. For several females, stran-
gers to me, had come up andkissed

However, my doctor informed
me that mono was caused by a

virus, and you could catch it just‘

like any other virus. I took this to
mean they didn't really know how
you caught it. However, the doctor
did say that if someone got right up
on top of you and kissed you
intensely, then there was a good
possibility of catching mono if that
someone had it.

Mono is popularly known as “the
kissing disease.” Strangely
enough, my eye doctor, of all
people, told me mono was a virus
and that this kissing disease
nonsense was just so much

‘bullshit.

performers in his unﬁnished work.
The story, of course, is of the
gallant, imaginary ﬁgure Cervant-
es has dreamed of becoming—Don
Quixote. With Cervantes taking the
lead role. the prisoners don their
costumes and the audience is taken
into the adventurous world of the
great warrior.

Quixote is a brave knight, living
in the glory of an era that ended
200 years ago. As such, he is
recognized as an old fool who is
going insane. But Quixote is blind
to 'all things except those he wants
to see, and in his steadfast way, he
gains the sympathy of those who
knew him and convinces the
woman he chooses for his maiden
that he is, in fact, a brave knight.

Quixote as a princess whose honor
he will defend. He recognizes the
inn as a great castle where he will
ask to be officially dubbed a knight
by the innkeeper, who is, in his
eyes, the lord of the castle. So, he
becomes the “Knight of the
Woeful Countenance.”

David Atkinson as Quixote
performed with the vigor, charm
and dignity that gives the famous
knight such an endearing quality.
He gently squeezed every drop of
sympathy from the audience and
made us want to believe in
Quixote’s dream, even though we
knew it could not come true.

Alice Evans as the bargirl

portrayal -as the hard-nosed woman
who scoffs at this “insane” knight
when she first meets him. But she

him in the courtyard and hears him
sing “The Impossible Dream,” she
is transformed into a believer of
that dream, as is the audience.

The singing of Atkinson and
Evans was strong and rich.

The stage setting was a
combination of blacks and grays,
overshadowed by the dominating-
drawbridge that ,served as the only

access to the prison. Bleak though’
the setting may be, Quixote
warmed the stage with his loveable

transformations, as several exper-
ience liberation from various types
of mental slavery and vestiges of
the black past. The setting is
unmistakably the 1976 Hill District
of Pittsburgh, with. references
made to Homewood: Walt Harper’s
and Bedford Avenue.

The “play” is composed of two
movements, each with an average
of 17 “impulses.” During each
impulse. one particular activity is
highlighted, while in other spaces,
actors involved in peripheral
activity “freeze."

The participants plow through

the‘ turmoil of everyday existence,‘.‘..,_,."

dealing with problems of ﬁdelity,
personal goodness, adultery, lone-
liness, self-awareness and the real
problems of the microcosm.

From their activity emanates a
sense_of purpose and a feeling of
immaculate strength. Perhaps
Durise (Dianne Hart) sums up the
meaning ofthe work when she says
toward the end, “It’s a new day.
Old days are gone for ever and ever
and...”

Slow Lives on a Humdrum is the
movement out of a certain conﬁned
existence; It 1s the new appraisal of

life and the determination to make
a future different from the past.

This is the one it’s all about.
‘After long weeks of practice and
battering opponent after opponent,
the Panther swim team finally will
get a chance to sink its teeth into
the type of competition for which
it's been waiting all season. The
Buckeyes of Ohio State will visit

A victory in this meet would
mean a lot to the lean- and hungry
Panthers. They've already estab-
lished themselves as the No. 1
team in the East, but this contest
could give them somethingevery

"BY TOM HALL

':{.:’MORGANTOWN, W..Va.--Question: Have you ever tried to play
basketball in a”zoo? If you haven’t, and you happen to be from Pitt, you
might try the West Virginia Coliseum. \

What struck me as soon as I entered the arena was a sign that read:
“If there’s one thing I HATE, it’s PITT.” Not very hospitable.

With the 10,058 Mountaineer partisans screeching ‘their quaint
colloquialism, “Beat the hell out of Pitt”; the din in that acoustically

perfect structure’was deafening. ‘

If that isn’t enough for some of you diehards, a close call against the
home team brought an appropriate reaction. The barrage of litter, ice
cubes, etc. that blanketed the Coliseum court was a disgrace and a

hazard to the players and officials.

Speaking of the officials, I might commend the team of Covert and
Shample—almost meaningless names at the bottom of a stat_
sheet—for keeping the players and fans under control, under
circumstances that could have turned the game into a vicious brawl.

ON SATURDAY EVENING, the Panthers will entertain the South
Carolina Gamecocks at the Field House.

Hotshot South Carolina is just that—-one of the best-shooting teams
the Cats will face this year. The Gamecocks are making just under 50%
of their field goal attempts, their 72% from the foul line is equally

impressive.

With the Panthers’ “amoeba defense” their main asset, it looks to
be a matter of the unstoppable force opposing the immovable object. ‘

Gamecock star Alex English leads South Carolina in scoring (22
points per game) and rebounding (10.2 rebounds per game). English
has an excellent 53.3 percent ﬁeld goal attempt record.

South Carolina, 13-6 going into last night’s contest with Fordham,‘
boasts two other double-ﬁgure scorers in forward Nate Davis (17.1) and

Mike Dunleavy (14.6).

the _butterfly——not a very pleasing
thought for the owner of sore
shoulders.

They (Ohio State) are better than
us in the first half of the meet,”
said Bradshaw, the man who has
turned the Pitt swim program into
the winner it is. “But if we can stay
close.enough in the first half, we
have a good chance of beating them

- in the second half of the meet,

where we-are stronger.”

One sore spot for the Panthers is
their relay results. All season‘ those
have been consistently
lower than those of Ohio State. The
Cats will have to win one of those
two relays, or the 14-point
advantage that comes with winning
both relays will be tough to
overcome. -

And then there’s the divers.
Ohio State has a tradition of having
the best divers in the country, and
if they are not the best this year,

‘they sure are close. Tom Fatyol,

Jeff Miller a-nd Dave Reeder have
to twist and somersault into the
water better than they have all
year.

It all comes down to one thing.
The difference in racetimes is not
that great_ between the two swim
teams and therefore an upset is
possible. , -

So if you read in the paper that
Pitt has beaten Ohio State, don’t be
too surprised—just be happy.

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.——-To
say the Pitt Panthers (8-14) lost to a
much better team Wednesday
night at the Coliseum would be to
make a questionable claim. To say
that the ﬁnal 85-72 score was
indicative of West Virginia’s (11-9)
dominance of the contest, would be
inaccurate. ’ .

“We were flat as a pancake,”
Coach Tim Grgurich said about a
game in which only the statistics
were relatively close.

The game started out even—a
15-footer by‘Larry -Harris knotted
the score at 6-6. But from that
point, the Mountaineers began
inching away, until Joedy Gardner
made the move of the game.

With 10:00 left in the ﬁrst halt,
the WVU coach inserted Warren
Baker into the lineup. For the next
ﬁve minutes, the Mountaineers

controlled the boards and fed‘ Baker

8 Hip Check Not Lost Art

BY STEVE SYBERT

‘Mike McDermott doesn't look.

like a- defenseman. He isn’t one of
those six-foot 200-pound guys who
instill fear into opponents by
merely looking at them—he’s got
other ways. I

At a time when the board check
has taken over as the chief
defensive tactic.’ in hockey, Mc-
Dermott believes in sticking to the
fundamentals and is one of the few
remaining players to use the tricky
hip check.

The hip check is not a bruising,
devastating check. .It is more
artistic, with timing, agility and
quickness all coming into play. An

attacking skater may think he is all
alone at the blue line, when...
boom, he is nailed by the crafty
defenseman.

“The hip check is a-balance type
of thing,” McDermott said. “If I
get down low enough, I can knock a
heavy guy over. But if I hit him
standing up’ and his weight is
against me, I won’t do as well
there.”

At only 5-10 and 143 pounds,
McDermott is small for a back-liner ,
but has the best-hipcheck on the
Pitt team. Against Ohio University
the senior social work major dealt a
perfect check,on an unsuspecting

opponent.
“He made the first move by

trying to go left,” McDermott said,‘ _

“but I spotted and got my left hip

into his.knee. It felt really solid '

when I got him.”

And how. The Ohio player had to '

be carried from the ice ,with a knee
injury, keeping 'him away "from
more than aperiod of action.

-“It was a National League hip
check,” said Coach Len Barcalow.
“Mike’s not a real heavy guy, but
he executed it perfectly.” .

McDermott insists he developed
the check not from watching the
pros (You rarely see one anymore
in the NHL), but on his own since
becoming a defenseman at age 12

“I really just started doing it
myself,” he said, “because I don't
pay that much attention to the pros.
I tried it and it worked, so I kept at
it. But I only use it when I'm 2oi_ri2
backwards and a guy’s coming
down the ice on me.”

Executing a hip check takes a lot
of brainwork. The defender must
allow the attacker to commit
himself, for if the defender moves
first, he may ﬁnd his opponent
behind him in’ one step and set up

WT" for a good shot at the goal.

“You lose about half of the ones

you try,” McDermott said. “I feel.

very capable, but there is the
possibility of missing. When I see
him make his move, I can se if I
have the possibility of making a hip
check."

- _ “Mike is a fine, smart-thinking

hockey player,” Barcalow said.

“He’s always thinking ahead. If all‘

hockey players thought like Mike,
you wouldn’t lose a game and the
defense would be fantastic.”

Like most dedicated defensemen
who don't score much and rarely
get any glory, McDermott gets
satisfaction’ from performing his
specialty well. '

“A really nice, clean hip check is
almost like a goal for me,” he said.
‘‘I don't get too many points, but I

get some good hip checks in the

games.” ‘

Club will travel to Penn State on

Cats Off and Running

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt track team is preparing

‘for its confrontation with Indiana

(Pa.) tomorrow afternoon at the
Field House. .

Two Pitt athletes already have
qualiﬁed for the NCAAs and the
rest of the team .hopes the
competetive atmosphere at the
meet will produce more exceptional
performances. Nick Martin and
Karl Farmer have qualiﬁed in the
mile and 600-yard runs respective-
ly, ' and Farmer will run his
specialty, the 600, while Martin
tests his speed and endurance in
the 'l,0O0-yard run tomorrow
against some worth opponents.

Head Coach Mike Agostinella,
commenting on some of the
changes in the lineup, said,
“We’re going to try some new
things, giving some of the guys a
faster race for the speed and also
changing the order of the relays to
ﬁnd the best combination.

“A few of the freshmen will get
their ﬁrst chance to run, and others

__to‘ change events;

“No one should take this meet
lightly. Indiana has a good team
and would enjoy nothing better
than a chance to run over Pitt.”

Pitt's ﬁeld competitors will be
Paul Ciotti and Greg Arsenua in
the pole vault, Eric Drescher in the
shot put and Dan Goodyear, Keith
Taylor, Don Maydak and Tom
Ward in the jumping events.

The Panther Relays will be as
strong as ever. The combination of
Farmer, Don Betterly, Willie
Walker and Kieth Keckenby will be
aiming for a sub-3:20 performance
in the mile relay. In the two-mile
relay, Martin, Tom Herrmann,
Rich Moore and Ron Morris are
hoping to run in the low 7:405.

Dan Schuerle and Kevin "Car-
penter will be running _two events
each, the 50-yard dash and 50-yard
high hurdles, even though Keith
Bookert and Walker will give Pitt a
strong sprint ﬁeld.

The Pitt distance runners are

expected to continue their domin-,

ance of the longer races this
Saturday. Bob Lee and Terry_ Wile

will set the pace in the three-mile-\

Featured in the two-mile run Will
be John Heiser, Mike McLaughlin,
Ron Wirick and Pitt’s premiere
two-miler: Mel Boyd.

Panthers Dave McDonald and
Mark Studinicki will compete in the
mile run‘.
