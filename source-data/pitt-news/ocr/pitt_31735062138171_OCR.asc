came clear from that Soullhern city to
see Pitt win. He said he had been
hearing so much about Georgia Tech
forthe past three years that he. was
crazy to see the Panthers trim them.

The action of Alumni Council was
‘based upon a recommendation of the
iUn_iv'ersity’s Publicity-Financial Bu-
reau, consisting of K. E. Davis, Carl-
ton G. Ketchum and J. -Steele Gow, all
members of Council. The -plan which
they presented at this meeting had
previously received the approval of
the Board of Trustees, and at last
week’s meeting was supported by
many Council members in talks em-
phasizing the extreme need -of just
such a. ‘building, after which a resolu-
tion declaring Alumni Council's sup-
port of the projection was adopted, the
terms of the resolution providing that
Council act as executive committee
for the campaign and devote all its
energy to the successful prosecution
of the task. . I

During the next few weeks an or-
ganization will be eﬂected among the
alumni which will include ‘representa-
tives of every class and school, as},
well as a secretary in each fraternity
and men from every district in which
there is a. group of alumni. The Pitt
Clubs will, of course, be included.
Through these alumni it is planned
that everyone calling himself a Pitt
man shall be reached and pledged for
a subscription. -

 

BELGIAN RULER
RECEIVES DEGREE

 

(‘Continued From Page One.)
its first university faculty, more
lt1han_ 100 years ago‘, had as its pro-
fes.sor of modern languages the first
parish priest of your‘ faith in Pitts-
burgh, the Rev. Charles B. McGuire,
founder of St. Paul's Church, now
the Cathedral Church, a graduate
of the University of Louvain.

“Perm-it me to recall to you that
in this University the late Prof.
Samuel P. Langley began his re-
searches in aeronautics which have
led to the conquest of the air. The
University is the cradle of the sci-
ence of aeronautics. More than
4,000 of the alumni and undergrad-
uaths of this University entered -the
military service of this country dur-
ing the late war and served on be-
half of that cause which you with
ineffable devotion served. Many of
them sleep their long last sleep on
the battlefields of France and Bel-
gium, '

“Mr. Chancellor, it is my distin-
guished honor on behalf of the
trustees of this University, including
the Governor of the Commonwealth
and the Mayor of the city, to pre-
sent to you for the highest academic
honor which we can bestow, His
Majesty, Albert, King of the Bel-
glans.”

Chancellor McCormick in confer-
ring the degree said:

“The University in conferring up-
on you the highest degree within its
power honors itself as much as it
honors you and, in obeying the ma.n-
date of the board, I feel that I am
obeying the highest mandate of the
great American people which, long
ago, enshrined you in their hearts
as their conception of a kingly and
heroic man and a heroic and manly
king.”

The king" responded brxeny and
spoke so low that the audience
leaned forward to catch his words.

“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he start-
ed, “I feel deeply the gift you make
me here today. Allow me -to utter
my heartiest thanks to Mr. Holland
and the chancellor for the very‘ kind
words they have addressed‘ to me.
It is with pleasure that I have wit-
nessed the progress of the institu-
tions of higher learning in your
country. Everywhere colleges are
springing up, and I see in this of
yours no small part of that system.
I appreciate the honor you have con-
ferred upon me. I have watched
the wonderful expansion of your
country, and your city has won, by
its accomplishments, as well as by
its culture, a great and growing
place in. the world.’’ a

The conclusion of the speech was
marked py much cheering. Led by
his majesty the party walked off the
-stage to the right

At 4:35 p. m. Pitt students again
viewed the royal party at Forbes
Field. A cheering contest between
Pitt and Tech students occurred
when the king and his party appear-
ed on the ﬁeld. The king remained
here for 15 minutes.

Other places visited by the king
during his visit here were: The
Carnegie Institute and the Carnegie
Library, the Duquesne mills of -the
Carnegie Steel Company and Expo-
sition Hall.

Famous San Carlo Basses in Great
Open-Air Productio~n at sheeps-
’ head Bay, N. Y.

 

Among the distinguished singers
selected for the mammoth, open-air
production of Verdi's opera, “Aida,”
at the famous Sheepshead Bay Speed-
way, New York,  ‘Saturday, August
16, last, were. the leading basses from
the San Carlo Grand Opera Company
—f—Signors Pietro DeBiasi and Natale
Cervi. These two many-fathomed
signers had, as their worthy co-stars
in the big spectacle, Mme. Marie Rap
pold, former Metropolitan ‘soprano;
Miss Cyrene Van Gordon, contralto,
and Sig. Riccardo ‘Stracciari, baritone,
both of the Chicago Opera; and Man-
uel Salazar, the Spanish tenor, from
the San Carlo.

Some 30,000 people witnessed this
stupendous event,_ without question
the greatest throng ever assembled
for an operatic performance in this
country. The total cast participating
numbered upwards of 1500 members,
and included a chorus of 800, an or-
chestra of 200 andaballet of 100. Be-
sides these were hundreds of extra
supers, while camels, elephants, oxen
and beautiful horses served to lend
realism to the Egyptian pageant, all
providing a scene of incomparable
beauty and, inspiration. From a clear
and ideal sky a brilliant moon shed
traditional rays down upon it all and
reminded one of the great-presenta-
tion of the Verdi masterpiece staged
at the foot of the Pyramids in Egypt
a few years back. .

The basso roles of "Ramﬂs” and
“King” were superbly sung by Messrs.
DeBiasi and Cervi, both of whom are
now on tour with the San Carlo. The
organization comes to the Pitt on
Monday, November 3rd, for its sixth
annual Pittsburgh engagement.

 

THE‘DAV|S

 

Keith vaudeville at the Davis Thea-

ter during the week which begins
next Monday afternoon, November 3,
is to present as 9. special dramatic
feature the distinguished legitimate
actress, Valerie Bergere, and her
company. in “The. Moth,” a. comedy
drama in four- scenes, by Emmet De-
voy. Miss Bergere’s supporting com-
Dany includes Herbert Warren, Ivan
Christie, Violet Barnes and Eiﬁe Bor-
dine. The playlet is ‘an entirely new
treatment of the time-honored tri-
angle. Mr. Devoy is said to have de-
vised an original dramatic construc-
tion, leaving his audience wholly in
the dark as to the developments be-
fore they occur. Miss Bergere is well-
known on both sides of the theater
world. She has starred under David
Belasco’s management in “Madame.
Butterﬂy,” succeeding B1anche.Bates,
and in “Naughty Anthony.” Vaude-
ville has known her as one of its

most lavish producers and most gifted _

players‘ in one-act sketches.

Among the eight other attractions
that will surround Miss Bergere and
her fellow-players are Phil Roy and
Roy Arthur, ‘in their comical juggling
sketch, entitled “A Chinese Restaur-
ant.” Jack Ryan and Eddie Healy,
with a lot of smart songs.

Seats for Bergere week will be
placed on sale next Mnoday.

THE GRAND

 

It is rarely that the villain of ‘a
story is the principal character. Such
is the case, however, in Eric "Stro-
heim’s dramatic achievement, “Blind
Husbands,” the latest big Universal
production, which will be presented as
the feature attraction at Pittsburgh’s
New Million-Dollar Grand all next
week, starting Monday morning, No-
vember 3. It is a story of domestic
diﬂiculties—almost domestic tragedy
—treated from an ultra-modern view-
point. It is original, fast-moving, with
many unexpected twists ' and turns
leading through tense, thrilling mo-
ments to an astounding climax.

Eric Stroheim has g ined wonder-
ful success by his work as a screen
villain. His acting has been so power.
ful, in fact, that helhas gainedwith
ease the title, “The Satan of ' the
Screen.” Few who saw it can forget
his wonderful picturization of the vil-
lain, the Hun oﬂicer, in “To Hell With
the Kaiser,” which played to immense
audiences at the Grand. No less ef-
fective was a similar characterization
in the astounding photoplay, , “The
Heart of Humanity.” “Blind Hus-
ands” is in no way a war ﬁlm, but his
role is as stupendous and destructive
a one as in the other pictures.

Mack :Sennett’s all-star comedy,

‘ “Salome vs. Shenandoah," will also be

on the program. In its cast are Ben
Turpin, Charles Murray, Louis Fazen-
da. Charles Conklin, Marie Provost,
Ford Sterling, Phyllis Haver and Har.
riet Hammond. Shown as well will be

the bankers of the town united to
pay honor, to their distinguished
associate, Mr. Howardj".‘Dunlap.

But the bankers. were paying
tribute to much more than a s1A1c- A.
cessful banker last night—-they .A
were honoring’ ‘something more-
fundamental than a great ﬁnancial
institution or a successful .life. A
They were really paying tribute
to a. successful American “home.

And twopeople have «made that

ﬁt, But in spite of this, ‘Pitt followers were predicting victory‘ seemingly, on?
, V a hunch. On paper, 9. _Tornado.win seemed entirely within. the bounds’ of
’ probability, but it must be remembered that the real strength of a Panther
team cannot be ﬁgured from a. dope -sheet, There must always be taken into
account two factors, namely, the -strategy of the’ “Old Fox” and ﬁghting spirit,’
of his» team, and these two things are what did the trick Saturday. Warner
knew that there was 8. punch left in his outﬁt and he also knew thag there
was, no better time to put that punch‘ over than at the very’ start "of the
game, before his crippl_ed warriors had spent theirtstrength. After this plan
of attack had pl'.oduced16 points, ,the Panthefs fought like, demons to retain
the lead, meeting the onslaughts "of the really powerful Southern backs in
a manner thatidid not‘ disclose the much-talked.-of weakness in the Pitt line.
' ' _ JJSTUDENT GETTING THE SPIRIT A A i

For the past several seaso s, football followers who have attended games
at Forbes Field have been wont to commentzon theapparent lack of spirit’
among the Pitt -students. But this yearthe bad -impression seemsin a fair
way of being dispelled. VNever beforehas-I Pitt cheering‘ approached‘ that
shown by the Panther students this fall.< Last rsatvurday, Cheerleader “Jim”
_ Scott launched {an innovation that went big. with the crowd in the stands.
The hand movements of the students whilethe ‘band played brought forth
rounds of applause that seemed to be .prol:npted’by real admiration on~the
part of the outsiders- A new wrinkle like this, combined ‘with lusty cheer-P
ing by the students,‘ always adds.colo-r to a. football game and puts the
crowd in the proper frameaof mind. Scotty is to be congratulated on the
success of‘his effort, ‘ ’ ‘

In the rest, of the quarter the

' The second _half showed the Cubs
to-a better advantage, but Kiski got

est fault on our side. The boys all
showed up well as a team but Hen-
drian the former-,Detroit High lad,
and {Hlolleram stood out in the back-
ﬁeld. On the line Bill Edgar was the
stellar performer. His work was the
biggest feature of the game. He

“As usual “Pop” Warner’s ﬁne hand
was much in evidence throughout , _ 
the game. V~ ‘ , DAVIES AND STEIN . _

~ , In the Tornado ‘game Saturday, two .of the Panthers. stood out most
prominently as factors in the victory. In the way of backﬁeld play, the,
performance of Tom Davies has probably not been surpassed on Forbes Field
for many seasons. The little wizard did everything that could be expected

,, of a real back.’ He plunged, kicked, passed, and skirted the ends gill -a
manner that was wonderful to behold. And, although he pads only a little

over 150 pounds’, he took the whole category of hard knocks and trotted off

the ﬁeld at the ﬁnal whistle in good shape. ’  I . _ j
c In the line,,Herb Stein was-the main strength‘ of the Panther defense

and it is not idle talk to say. that he held up. his end in Bob Peck style.

Like the famous Bob, he plays a roving center, being in a position, to diagnose

the opponents’ attack and--throw himself into the breach to check an advance.

The work of the big center is exciting favorable.-comment among all who

‘attend Pitt football games regularly. ’ ' _ ‘ * _

»  ,  THE»W.&J. GAME. W , -
When Syracuse upset the Panthers in such decisive fashion ‘on October

18, "predictions came thick and fast from the experts in the East that the Big

Orange, would have their pictures on the first page of Spaulding’s. Oﬁicial

Guide this winter. But the dope often goes awry. Last Saturday a team

from Little-Washington romped 311 over 0’Neill’s men. and nowV:..the eastern

championship is in a muddl,e. Whereas the contest between Pitt and W.

& J. has always been a big event on the schedules of the two schools, this

. year it promises to be a factor in determining the disposition of the national

title; 4 If Pitt should be victorious,‘ the Panthers cannot be declared out of

the running and the matter wi1l.beV more.‘ complicated than ever. On the
other hand, if defeat comes our way, our ancientrivals will have a just claim

to supremacy on the gridiron this fall. ‘ — ' ‘ 1'

NEW MEMBERS AT IIAME

Between halves of the Georgia
Tech game,’SaturdaY» the Hi-Kockeys
initiated three new members into
their club—Upham, Mines; Schlegel,
Economics and Gregory, Dental. .The
ceremony, which closely resembled
one of those “pre—breakfast settin’-ups"
in the army, intemningled with coo-
coos, brought loud applause fromthe
cheering section. The initiated men
are, underthe ,club’s_ classiﬁcation,
.“yokes,” and for the next ﬁfteen days
will be “recognized by the large yellow
streamers, which they will wear. The
initiated will then go through two
more stages and, at the completion _of
these periods, will be regulars.

  AT FIIRBES FIELD
SATURDAY

The next game onnthe Cub schedule
with Indiana Normal, looms. up as a
hard one. Indiana always has a big
heavy team and in the lastfew years

Lentz,» Harrick, Putts and Jones. This
year they have done well defeating
the W. Va. Reserves and holding the
undefeated State Yearlings‘ toa '13-0
séore. Indiana is out of its class with
Normal Schools and must, take, on
teams like our Freshies in order to
get a good -game. Their teams are
well coached and: fast, though heavy,
and undoubtedly will give. the Fresh
‘a good game- A large number of In.

L diana rooters will be on hand as there

are many of them‘ in Pittsburgh and
the Yearlings will be well supported
as usual. The game starts at three
and will be played at Forbes ﬁeld."
