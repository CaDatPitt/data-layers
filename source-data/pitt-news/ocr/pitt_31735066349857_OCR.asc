Nixon Stumps Senate

W3For Draft Law Passage

-WASHINGTON (AP)—President

 Nixon put pressure on Congress

yesterday to pass military draft
legislation, which is scheduled for

, aSenate vote today.
 The bill combining a two-year

r

 draft authority,

 extension of draft authority and a
 $2.4 billion pay raise for mili-
 tary personnel has been passed by
the.House but stalled in the Senate.
Vietnam war critics and senators
 opposed to any draft law say they

 will fight it.

If Congress fails to continue the
which expired
last June 30, Nixon said the result

_ would make the United States “the

 second strongest nation in the
 world with all the implications
 that has.”

Nixon said at a news confer-
ence that scuttling of the draft
legislation.would jeopardize in-
ternational negotiations in which

,?,,the United States hopes to reduce

"’East-West armaments on a has-
is of mutual agreement.

At the Capitol, Sen. Gordon Al-
lott, R.-Colo., told the Senate that
the President‘ has agreed to sup-
port separate legislation to boost
the pay of servicemen in the low-
est grades more than the bill pro-
vides.

This dimmed the chances for
passage of a motion to table the
draft legislation, which Sen. Mike
Mansfield, D.-Mont., said that he
will offer today.

A key issue is an amendment

: sponsored by Mansfield calling

for withdrawal of all U.S. troops
in Indochina in nine months, pro—

‘?-ayided U.S. prisoners of war are

released. Senate-House conferees
watered this down to call for an
end of U.S. military operations in
Indochina at the earliest practi-
cable date.

\ Allott said he will offer an
amendment to the military pro— '
curement bill, slated to be
brought up in the Senate after the
draft legislation, to add some $300
million to pay raises for service-
men, in addition to the increase
in the draft bill.

2 Meanwhile, Army officials re-

ported that less than one fifth of

their recent “true volunteers”
scored high in intelligence apti-
tude tests, leading them to doubt
that the United States can field a '
qualified all volunteer force.

Press Appears

Ready to Roll

PITTSBURGH (AP)—The Pitts-
burgh Press Co. which prints both
the city’s daily newspapers. said
qcﬁsyesterday that barring any fur-
ther labor problems it plans to
resume publication with Monday

morning editions.

City area residents have been
without either the morning Post-
Gazette and the evening Press for
more than four months as a re-
sult of a succession of labor dis-
putes beginning with a marathon

strike by printers May 14. _

The Press announcement came
hours after a tentative agreement
had been hammered out with its
engravers union during an all-
night session that ended about

dawn Thursday.

 Apparently only the approval of

, the engravers’ rank-and-file is
needed to start the presses rolling

, . Sunday night. Approval by the en-

. _. H I,“
, _ .

gravers would mean that the
Press has either contractural or
working agreements with each of
its 11 craft unions.

On Wednesday, the Press was
given assurances by its stereo-
typers union that its ‘.‘.‘u.€¥l‘:i)‘,-‘.l“?.
were prepared to return to 
even though they haven‘t _'~,‘e!.
reached a contract agreement.

In announcing v tans for resump-
tion of publication, a Press
spokesman said Monday’s edi-
tions of the Post-Gazette should
be on the streets by Sunday night
and that the Press should be out
on schedule Monday afternoon.

He said employes are being call-
ed back as they are needed.

Both papers have lost tens-of-
thousands of dollars so far in
business and advertising as a re-
sult of the extended strike.

The University has finally
reached a definite agreement with
the Oakland community concern-
ing the setting aside-of a section
of Panther Hollow for student
parking.

In return for the right to lease
the land from the B&O Railroad,
the University has ensured that
trees and grass will be planted on
the strip bordering the lot. Land-

scapting was scheduled to begin’

yesterday. A
According to landscape archi-

tect Dan Pasquarella, the new lot‘

will accommodate approximate-
ly 140 cars. The original Uni-
versity estimate had been 270
spaces, and the Commuter Asso-

ciation (CA) had approximated‘

180.

The lot will be surfaced with a
special type of slag that is ex-
pected to minimize dust and mud.

CA President Torn Gainan said

‘ that the lot would be ready for use

in about A a month. At present,
about 60 spaces in Panther Hollow
are being used by commuters.

Negotiations are currently un-
derway to have the campus bus
routed through Panther Hollow. -

Gainan also noted that the for-
mer Oakland Lutheran Cemetery,
expected to provide about 200
spaces for students and another
300 for faculty members, should
’be ready at that time.

It has not yet been decided
««ll9l.l1e1“ parking fees will be re-
:.'.gui':-ecsi on ;: montiily or daily basis.

In ;=ul.§.*. the Physical Plant Di-
‘Asian had informed commuters
‘was.’ 410 extra parking spaces
would be available by Sept. 2, how-
ever. none of these materialized
atthat time.

Members of the CA met with a
number of University administra-
tors last Wednesday to consider
the formation of a formal Univer-
sity policy on student parking.
Also discussed was the possibil-
ity of obtaining 250 spaces in the
Forbes Field area for next fall.

The CA is also urging all inter-

ested commuters to sign up for a‘

commuter car pool Sept. 23.
Registration will be held from 12
noon to 3 p.m; in the SU Ballroom.

 

in an American prison in at least
a generation.

The State Corrections Depart-
ment set the bloody Monday
death toll at nine hostages and 32
convicts.

A 42nd fatality, ‘prison guard
William Quinn, 28, died from in-
juries when inmates took over the
prison. ‘

Originally, eight of the Attica
hostages—guards and other pris-
on employees—were said to have
been killed by convicts who slit
their throats with makeshift
knives. A ninth hostage’s death
was attributed to gunfire.

However, a medical examiner’s
report 24 hours later ascribed the
eight deaths to gunshot wounds
and said there was no indication
of throat slashing on the bodies.

Though there was no immedi-
ate official explanation of the
source of the gunfire which killed
the hostages, State Corrections
Commissioner Russell. Oswald
admitted to newsmlen that the
throat slitting reports were false
and indicated the hostages could
have been subjected to gunfire
from state troopers.

The hostage victims" reportedly '

had been stripped of their own
clothing and forced to don inmate
garb. Oswald said this could have
confused trooper marksmen.

Remaining unanswered, _ how-
ever, were how the reports of
throat slittings originated, the
origin" of false ‘reports that some
of the hostages were killed before
the Monday assault, and that at
least one had been castrated, and
what were the precise instruc-
tions given the assault forces.

Oswald had given in to a long
list of demands from Attica riot-
ers. But he balked at insuring
them total amnesty, in light of

still retains the death penalty for "

Eighty-five per cent of Attic’s
prisoners are black or Puerto Ri-
can. During the rioting, some of
them indicated an adherence to
the militant Black Panthers or
the Black Muslims.

Rockefeller attributed the trag-
edy at Attica to “the highly or-
ganized revolutionary tactics of

‘ militants,” and said he would

seek to determine “(the role that
outside forces would appear to
have played. ”

Attica rioters had demanded .

nor was criticized in some quar-.__—i'. 0‘

stead, he left the talking to Os- 

wald.

Unrest generated by the Attica-*

riot spread to other prisons in ;;:- 

New York and elsewhere.

State troopers stood emergen-if-2:"-i~

fixtures and lights, and .plugged_

The mix-up began when SA
Social Commissioner Lenny Kla-
vonic asked the Athletic Depart-
ment in April for special seat-
ing arrangements for Fitzgerald
Field House, where the con-
cert will beheld later this month.

“It was our understanding,”
said Athletic Department Busi-

“Open-Admissions”. although
not fully defined, is a policy
of admitting any qualified stu-
dent who applies to a University.

The policy was recently insti-
tuted at the City College of New
York (CCNY) and now any High
School Graduate from New York
City is admitted to the college
regardless of his high school
grades. Consequently, 40,000
freshmen are now enrolled at

was placed against the back wall.

Klavonic allegedly verbally
instructed the Department to
dismantle the bleachers, though
he issued no written work order.

Klavonic and the Athletic De-
partment had overlooked the fact
that installation of a banked track
and mechanical baseball appara-
tus since Kennedy’s appearance
made similar seating arrange-
ments unfeasible.

Referring to recent discussions
of the policy here, Kenneth J.
Wenger, Director of Admissions,
_said, “It is impossible for Pitt,
at its present state to consider
open-admissions.”

Wenger cited the inability of
the University'to accommodate
the larger amount students as
the main evidence against such
apolicy.

Admissions hopes to incorporate

“That was the logical question
to ask,” he said, “but no one
seemed to ask it.”

Lederman said that 108 man
hours, at five dollars an hour, had
been devoted to dismantling the
bleachers, and that an equal num-
ber of hours would probably
be necessary to restore them. He
estimated that the cost to the so-
cial commission for labor could
go as high as $1000.

cerned the instructions he had

partment in April.

dents. ‘

Ms. Leslie McNamara, admin-
istrative assistant for the De-
partment of Admissions, and
Wenger bemoaned the lack of
communication between 1 high
school seniors and guidance
counselors. They also cited the
need for college students to keep
applicants from their former high
schools informed of activities and

‘ policies at their colleges.

“It would make it more per-
sonalized,” said Ms. McNamara,
"if high school seniors could
hear the news first-hand from a
person they might know.”

Wenger hopes to include col-
lege students in the admissions
program before December. “By
utilizing the college student it
would be much easier for us to
answer the questions ‘how do
we get at them’ and ‘what do we
do ‘to interest them in Pitt.”
Wenger said.

As its brochure points out,
"Providing a good lunch at mi-
nimal cost” is one way the Cen-

lunch program at the Center,”
it says, “grows out of the philo-
sophy which sees service to per-

tence of the Church”.

The pastors of the Center,
Charles Carlson and J. Paul Bal-
as, are not only concerned with
satisfying the appetites of the
diners, but also with “creating

- an. atmosphere of openness, un-

derstanding, and acceptance; an
atmosphere in which real‘com-
munication and interchange can
take place. ‘ ‘

The lunch program began five
or six years ago when students
asked if they could use the
Church’s facilities to make cof-
fee and soup at lunchtime. The
coordinators decided to organize
and facilitate a luncheon program
for the University Community.

The major cost of the lunch
program is subsidized by the
Lutheran Church; however, do-
nations of 60¢ are required in or-
der that the Center can buy
food for the program and not go
into bankruptcy: The food pro-
gram is completely a non-profit
arrangement.

Cooks are rounded up on all"

volunteer basis. The major por-

tion of the cooking and serving

is done by workers from local
Lutheran congregations.

During the 1970-71 year, the
Center served approximately 12,-

000 lunches to students and Uni-

versity. The Center serves be-
tween 100-130 people a day. (And

that’s alot of soup and sandwich- , 7

Scientists Link Pot,

Animal Brain Damage

WASHINGTON (AP)—Two scientists reported Wednesday the
first evidence of brain damage to animals exposed to marijuana over
long periods.

They stressed that they do no know yet whether results with rats
are applicable to humans but they urged doctors to be alert for symp-
toms in long-time users of the drugs. -

The researchers said the rats showed bizarre reactions resulting
from the brain damage presumably caused. by the administration of
marijuana. And they suggested doctors watch forsigns of tremors and
convulsions in patients known to be longtime marijuana users.

They stressed that the amounts of the drug used on rats were 10
times as high as those believed to be consumed by most chronic mari-
juana users. They estimated it would require smoking about 50 mari-
juana cigarettes daily for an undetermined period of time to learn
whether effects on man would be comparable to those shown in the
rats.

 Nevertheless, one of the scientists in reply to a news conference
(‘question said doctors should be on the alert for early signs among
marijuana smokers of the bizarre reactions that was noted in the ro-
dents. He said detection of such early warning sings make possible
quick treatment to forestall permanent brain damage.

The findings were submitted to the 162nd annual meeting of the
American Chemiqal Society by Dr. Harris Rosenkrantz, a Ph.D. and di-
rector’of bio chemistry of the Mason Research Institute, Worcester,
Mass., and researcher Yugal K. Luthra, also of the Mason Institute.

They said the studies were done under contract with the govern-

ment’s National Institute of Mental Health which furnished the mari- '

juana chemicals used.

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
    

    

HARRISBURG (AP) - The
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA),
said Wednesday it mailed notices

of scholarship awards to 91,705
students.

Executive Director Kenneth R.
Reeher estimated the value of the
grants at $56,255,675.

The Agency is awaiting addi-
tional information from 17,500
other students_before processing
their applications, Reeher added.

He said cancellations, dropouts
and students who never enroll will
bring the cost of the 1971-72
scholarship program down to

_$55.4 million, the amount appro-

priated to it by the Legislature.

Some 21.700 students were
being notified that they did not
qualify for scholarships, Reeher
said.

This year, the program was re-
vised to assure that students re-
ceive no more than one-third of
their need through state scholar-
ship funds. The maximum ‘grant
is $1,200. The new system is ex-
pected to give the biggest bene-

fits to students in private colleges. .

“We must fill the existing va-
cancies in our private colleges
or finance more buildings at the
state supported schools to handle
current enrollments,” Reeher
said.

 Senatorial Scholarships:
   Expediency Triumphs

The University of Pittsburgh pays a price for its state-relatedness.
Each year Pitt surrenders half a million dollars. its integrity. and its
virtgus, leaving a veritas that is keenly disappointing.

Last year, the University awarded $493,972 worth of "senatorial
‘ scholarships” to students who were,not required to demonstrate fi-
nancial need, despite an official policy of “helping students based on
j“needf'
s The half-million dollars accounts for one-quarter of the total schol-
' arship money- allocated by the University, according to Charles Dees,
 director of Student Aid.

 Contrary to popular suspicion. funds‘ for senatorial scholarhips

. ‘come not from the State Legislature but from the University. Thus. the

];'_; _ awards represent not merely an inequity but a drain on the University‘s
_,finances.

   
  
  
  
   

 Apparently, the University is under no legal obligation to award
_-senatorial scholarships. Lieutenant Governor Ernest _Kline, a former
’ state senator, explains that the “practice is traditional.

An 1895 statute requires the University to entrust senators from-'

 

 ‘mining districts in Pennsylvania with scholarships, but no other legal ~

requirements seem to exist.

 U , However, the University, which depends on the State Legislature
‘?>~i--irfor a large share of its budget, feels it must gratify state senators and
 “continue the practice, for fear of antagonizing the state senate

 Editorial

_ i J ' According to State Senator Robert Fleming of Aspinwall, senatorial
 scholarships were instituted “with the idea that they wou1d’make the
—:_ Legislature more favorable to colleges which needed _the state s help.

   . Each of the state’s 50 senators can currently award to students of
;. _,tIieir choice half-tuition scholarships to Pitt, Temple, Penn State, the
.f-] fllniversity of Pennsylvania, and Lincoln College in Chester County.

, Every year, each Senator is entitled to award 48 new single term
scholarships, 24 new one-year scholarships, six new four-year.scho1-
'i _,arships, or an appropriate mixture of the above—to each of the five in-
,-‘3'sititutions of higher learning. Old scholarships are continued until they
, jgfexpire.

H, A senator can, if he cares to, stockpile scholarships. In short, he
rfneed not award 24 one-year scholarships in any particular year; he
5 ‘jean, instead, award 12 one year and 36 the next.

A senator can also allot scholarships to a colleague, if he chooses.

A Philadelphia senator, for example, might allot several Pitt scholar-
ships to a Pittsburgh senator for distribution, or vice versa. I

Some senators are scrupulous in allotting their scholarships. Sen-
ator Robert Fleming, for exampleghas turned the distribution of his
scholarships over to a board of three educators.

But, according to the Lieutenant Governor, who was prudently
cryptic, “senatorial scholarships are used by senators in various
ways." The imagination need not run wild to conceive of an obvious use
of such scholarships—as a reward for political favors. ”

“I think most of the senators try to give the scholarships out on the
basis of need,” Senator Fleming contends.

But can the University trust to the prdbability of state senators?
Or must it realistically evaluate the likelihood of the usage of sena-
torial scholarships as political plums?
The University boasts that it awards scholarships to students on
the basis of financial need. ‘

But one-half of the University’s scholarships (senatorial ‘plus'athle-
tic) are not contingent on financial need. Out of $2 million in scholar-
ships, ‘$1 million is not based on need! -

Bluntly, the University is perpetrating a public relations fraud of
the highest order. It claims to have taken great strides toward elimin-
ating scholarships not based on financial need.

That claim is blatantly specious.

Pitt’s scholarships system reeks of hypocrisy and smacks of in-
consistency. ~

Prison Tragedy I

pression’ Slain

'-I

by BOB GING
"Prior to this week, few people

It. were aware of the existence of

‘-:<

 Attica State Prison. Now, Attica

ff  ,is_- spoken by many ‘in the same

'1' j“: light as Kent and Jackson State.

'1  'fThe real truth surrounding the
1’ riot at Attica in which one thou-

7. sand prisoners took place and 42
 men died may never be known, for

already attempts have been made
to prevent the public from ever

7 knowing what happened.

_ For three days prior to the as-
sault by state police and members
of the National Guard, a semi-of-
ficial group of negotiators had
been meeting with the prisoners

A ' to work out some type of peaceful

settlement.
Of the 40 demands made by the
prisoners, 38 had been agreed

— upon but one major demand,

amnesty for those involved, was
denied by, Wyoming County DA
James.

For his stauncherefusal to grant
amnesty, he received the congrat-

', ulations of Gov. Nelson Rockefell-

 

er and 41 men died.

Intthe aftermath of the Attica
bloodbath, officials, specifically
the Commissioner of Correctional
Institutions for New York, claim-
ed that the nine guards who had
died as hostages had been killed
by the prisoners.

In_ a news conference, Commis-
sioner Oswald stated that the hos-
tages had had their throats slash-
ed and their bodies mutilated at
the beginning of the assault.

Monroe County Medical Examin-
er Dr. John Edland, who perform-
ed the autopsy on eight of the nine
hostages, claimed’ that not only
were none of the bodies mutilated,

j ' that all -had died from gunshot _

    

While some zip-guns had been
found after the riot, Dr. Edland
claimed that the wounds could not
have been made by these guns,
and Gerald Houlihan, an aid to
Commissioner Oswald claimed no
other firearms had been found.

One is not even curious to know

why this attempted coverup was
made.

In the wake of this disaster and
with the truth beginning to seed
out, Rockefeller received the sup-
port of President Nixon for the ac-
tions taken at Attica. It must have
been a great consolation to Rocke-
feller to know that the senseless
deaths of 31 prisoners and nine
guards were lauded in our na-
tion’s capital.

”f hose who
cannot be

stifled
are killed”

 

Not allﬂof this country's leaders
are so blind to the value of hu-
man life, however. Senator Ed-
mund Muskie condemned the use-
less slayings saying, “The Attica
tragedy is more stark proof that
something is terribly wrong in
America.”

The deaths last year at Kent
and Jackson proved fruitless, for
the American war machine grinds
on taking more lives each day. The
slaughter at Attica will probably
be doomed to the same fate and
prison reform will again be shad-
owed by such crisis as the value
of Almighty American Dollar._

   

  

dent, however. In prisons through-
out the country, inmates turn to
violence after all other means of
attempting change have failed. A
striking example of this is West-
ern State Penitentiary here in
Pittsburgh.

 The Pltt News
OPINION

“West Penn is a penal lnSlll’.lltl0nF

where 50 to 60 per cent of the in-
mates are black. There are no
black administrators. '

Recently, attempts at reform
were made there. Allyn Sielaff,
head of the Bureau of Correction
in Pennsylvania, appointed
Charles Austin, director of treat-
merit at West Penn, last year. Aus-
tin,although white, was reform-
minded. .

During his term there, Austin
worked toward programs such as
a furlough program, whereby in-
mates could go home to see their
families, and encouraged the pub-
lication of Vibrations, a prisoner’s
newspaper. Austin has since been

transferred out of West Penn’

and back to Harrisburg.

Vibrations met with a similar
fate. Because it eased racial ten-
sions and gave both black and
white prisoners a sense of unity
and aeforum for expression, it is
no longer printed. Many of the
prisoners who had worked on the
publication have since been trans-
ferred to- other correctional insti-
tutions. ‘

The prison system in this coun-
try is one of the most glaring ex-
amples of a festering, racist stat-

v_ _ us quo. Thosewho speak‘ out are-
stifle'd;athos9r,wh9.'i.¢g,_iinqt%.be.-stiiigg t

 

 

  

edare killed. ,
The tragedy at Attica should do

..more than makeon aware of pris-

on reform, for prisons are only a
reflection of the greater society.
As Mayor Kenneth Gibson of New-
ark put it, “We see the same

face of racismewhich caused, and.

them put down with force, civil

disturbances in the country’s
ghettos.”
What Attica signifies even

more, is the fact that no longer
will our government stop with the
genocide of minorities, such as
theiblacks, and the Vietnames.

Now it is willing to sacrifice
even its own agents of repression,
to shoot its own prison guards,
to keep the people in their place.

Draft Registration Continues; 

In the second in their series
on military obligations and al-
ternatives Pitt News reporters
Zych and Frisbie explore both_
the draft bill pending in Con-
gress. V

by STEVE ZYCH &
SONDRA FRISBIE

Although Congress has not yet
passed a new Selective Service
law, young men must still reg-
ister for the draft. 0

Because Congress has extend-
ed the President’s authority to
conscript young men, registra-
tion is still mandatory; but Pre-
sident Nixon haslindicated he

will not exercise that authority.

until Congress passes new draft
legislation.

“Young men must continue to
register for the draft, carry their

"draft card, and report any change

in status to their local draft
board," Dave Curry, assistant
U.S. attorney, explains. “In the
event of a manpower shortage,

. the President has the authority

to draft those with“high num-
bers,” stated Curry.

‘ Curry went on to note that
college student deferr/nents (2-
S) would be abolished in the new
selective service bill, heldup in
Congress ‘since June 30. The.only
exemptions will be» for medical
and divinity students. However,
if a divinity student leaves the
ministry, he is -eligible for the
draft until he is 35 years of age.

Dental Dress Code 4  

Reforms Accelerated  

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Robert Laurenzano, president
of the local StudentAmerican
Dental Association, '(SADA)
claims heis making headway in
his campaign to revise the Den-

T tal School dress'code.
The code regulations , enacted-

over the summer, forbid hair-
styles extending to the collar or
falling below. the eyebrows on
men,_ and require women with
long hair to tie it in the back."
Sideburns below the earlobe
and beardsare not permitted,
and females may not wear V-
necklines nor bikini underpants.

Laurenzano maintains that
these rules are‘ “embarrassing”

and that no need for them ex--

ists. “The SADA recently met
with the Committee on Profes-
sional Ethics,” he said, “where
it was agreedthat students will
have a chance to review, amend,
and delete parts of the code.”

The SADA, said its local pre-
sident, is , cooperating closely
with the faculty and administra-
tors. Laurenzano said that at a
meeting of the entire school, he
said, the Dean, (Dr. Edward For-
rest) declared a one—year mora-
torium on the code.

Laurenzano said he is pushing
for “total revision of the code,
turning it _into a code of ethics

instead. Emphasis,” he said, T

“should be-placed on the doctor’s

Anthony Stakis, president of '

the Dental School sophomore
class said he has collected “lit-
tle feedback” about the code
from fellow students. “I can’t
really say that there is an en-
forced code,”. he remarked.
“Since the Dean has announced
a moratorium on it, there has

- been_a relaxation of tension.”

. Commenting on Laurenzano’s
efforts, Stakis» praised him for
“doing a good job.» He is ex-
tremely organized, and has been
able to mobilize interest in SA-
DA.” . . '

“The main issue,” he contin-
ued, “is that in a professional

     Energy Lab Studies  Human E

by HEIDI LEVIN

A Cardiac Rehabilitation Program,
sports medicine seminars, and research
into perceived exertion are among the con-
tinuing programs at the University’s Hu-
man Energy Research Laboratory
(HERL). '

HERL was established at Trees Hall in
1965 and is currently under the direction
of Dr. Bruce.J. Noble, assisted by Dr. Ken-
neth F. Metz. Besides its research pro-
jects, HERL is responsible for the scienti-
fic foundations courses offered physical,
education majors, and offers graduate
study in areas such as sports medicine
and exercise physiology.

In January, in conjunction with the West-
ern Pennsylvania Heart Association, HERL
initiated a Cardiac Rehabilitation .Pro-
gram. Post-cardiac patients are referred
to the program by their physicians for
carefully designed exercise programs.

Each participant is stress-tested to de-
termine his exercise tolerance level.
HERL then prescribes an exercise pro-
gram on‘a level safely below the individ-
ual’s maximum tolerance point.

The exercise programs are’ conducted
at the YMHA, the Golden Triangle Y, and

vania, and Pitt's School of Medicine, and
is designed for economically disadvan-
taged cardiac patients who might not
otherwise be able to participate.

HERL offers a Sports Medicine seminar
each winter. Seminar instructors include
professionals from the departments of
physiology, medicine, and physical educa-
tion. The seminar is designed to study all
aspects of sports activity, from the effects
of playing conditions to the physical condi-
tion of the atheletes involved.

Noble expressed an interest in HERL‘s
working with the Department of Sports
Medicine. The opening of the new depart-

Counseling Center Awaits Customers

by BILL MADARA

The arduous task of planning
one’s future seems easy until the
student is confronted with it. The
student may ask, “Where do I go
for help?” The Educational and
Vocational Counseling Service is
the answer.

This service is organized to aid
the student in deciding upon a ma-

, jor, directing him towards the

correct course of study. It also
aids him in obtaining information
about his career, gearing his
studies towards his future.

However, the center remains
virtually unused after the masses
have completed registration, and
the Add-Drop panic has subsided.

The Center expedites registra-
tion and helps make certain

Solutions for some of the criti-
cal problems of air polution con-
trol in the metals industry will be
examined in a special eight week
course offered by the School of
Engineering.

The course will meet on Mon—
day evenings from 6:30 to 9 p.m.
Sept. 20 through Nov. 15 in
Benedum Hall.

The University has received a
valuable Japanese painting and
scrolls from General Matthew
Ridgway, Supreme Commander
for Allied Powers in Japan in 1951-
52. _

-The painting, “Green Pine in
the Prohibited City,” the work of
Seiho Takeuchi, was given to Gen.
Ridgway by the Japanese people.

The scrolls, in Japanese brush,
includes letters of appreciation
from the government and people
of the Amami Islands for the as-
sistance of the Allied civil gov-
ernment in the period following
the Second World War.

schedules do not conflict. How-
ever, it goes beyond these serv-
ices, aiding the student in solving
personal problems concerning
their education and future.

The Center recently had its en-
tire structure revamped. The
staff was enlarged and several
additions were made to the pro-
gram; these changes concentrat-
ed on serving each student as an
individual, and doing it as effec-
tively as possible. The center has
40 advisors who handle 120 stu-
dents each. Formerly fewer advi-
sors were available and each han-
dled a greater number of stu-
dents.

Advisors are required to be
graduate students with one year

of study and must attend an ex- «

Activities

This group and its parent or-
ganization, Citizens‘ for McGov-
ern, both have their regional of-

fices in Pittsburgh. The groups for '

McGovern in this area are being
coordinated by Harris Miller, a
senior political science/philoso-
phy major at Pitt.

Both the Citizens for McGovern
and the Student and Youth groups
were formed in the spring of this
year, following the Senator’s an-
nouncement that he would be a

candidate for the Presidency. They 1

have been active in the voter reg—‘
istration drive period which ends
Sept. 20 and will resume that ac-
tivity following the fall elections.

_The major focus of the groups
presently, however, is being di-
rected toward a rally here in
Pittsburgh Nov. 14, at which Sen-
ator McGovern will speak.

To acquaint students, youth, and
the community with the objec-
tives and position of the Senator,
and to organize support for their
effort, the Students and Youth
group will sponsor a picnic in
Schenley Park Sept. 26 at 1 p.m.,
near Flagstaff Hill. All those in-
terested are invited to attend.

tensive three week training pro-

advisors to assist students in
planning courses for any major.

Advisors are also kept inform-
ed of any new programs, courses,
and other services, by attending
frequent “brush up” meetings.
Most advisor’s,also maintain a
list of information vital to many
students, such as, “cake” courses
and the .best liked and easiest pro-
fessors.

Recent additions to the Center
are Pre-Law and Pre-Med advis-
ing, Pre-Professional Advising

ninga related course of study.

The Pre-Professional Advising
Committee covers dental, medi-
cal, and opthamological fields. It
assists students in applying to
graduate and professional schools,
organizing tests and interviews,
and so on. They are generally con-
cerned with the student who
would like a career in these areas,

but is discouraged by the nature

of courses and the competition.

The Center. is the coordinator
for UCEP advising. It handles
cases concerning minority group
programs, career plans and so on.

The Center, located on the ninth
floor of the Cathedral, serves 6-8,-
000,students per year. including
freshman, sophomores, and trans-
fer students. It is open from 9
a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m. How-
ever, each advisor maintains his
or her own schedule and is avail-
able 15 to 20 hours a week,
several hours a day. Individual
schedules may be checked at the
receptionists desk on the ninth
floor or you can call the Advising
Office at ext. 7265.

rituals of movement and unity of
‘a trio of dancers. Tucking his
camera into every conceivable
cranny, Ed Emshwillerf examines
the dancers ‘who merge through
the vehicle of the dance.— V

Froma tentative, classical be-

physical contact of the dance.

As the dancers become more in-

“Gollee," drawls Miss
Dixie, “Ah always let mah boy
friend think he's best, ’cause
that’s the way it should be.”

The film is an effective plea,
for women’s liberation, minus the
grating rhetoric of the move-
ment. ' ,

Some of the film—makers dote_
on their own innovations, paying
little attention to the finished pro-
duct. Thus, in Grateful Dead, Rob-
ert Nelson falls all over his cam-
era trying to give us different pic-
tures of the dead, most of which
are simply boring.’

Fortunately, each of the eight
films was short; new techniques
that bombed weren’t allowed to
become tootedious.

Steve Savage, co-ordinator of
the Series, predicted that “some
people are going to be turned off

Out

‘ By STEVE ZYCH
Eighty-nine thousand dollars for a home for the Pro- .

vost but not one cent for “marginal sports” like ice hockey
and rifle. This is the way of life at Pitt.

i Last week the Athletic Department dropped the rifle
team from its budget and refused “to in any way fund”

the ice hockeyclub. By its

actions the Athletic Depart-

ment has literally sealed the coffins of these two “margin-
al” sports. In the case of the hockey club, it was swatted
down before it was ever allowed to attain varsity status.

I The rifle team has already disbanded and it is diffi-
cult to envision the hockey club, a much ‘more expensive
proposition, from being able to avoid a similar misfortune.

In one case of the rifle team this will mean that West-

ern Pennsylvania’s largest rifle range will fall i
‘as even the R.O.T.C. people rarely ‘ "
go up there anymore. The rifle team
however generated little, if any,

fan interest.

The hockey club‘ though, in only
its first year, was averaging more
funs to its exciting matches than?
any other Pitt team’except for foot-=

ball, basketball, and wrestling.

The rationale used by the Ath ‘
letic Department for the refusal t .

Fine, but why eliminate a few in favorof the major-
ity when there is no need for such drastic measures. In-
stead why not cut away’ a little in all sports instead of sing-
ling out the ones that cost the least?

The total budget for the rifle team last year was $2,-
100, of which $600 was returned at the end of the year.
This meant an expenditure of only $1,500.

Fifteen hundred dollars! The cost of “laundry money”
and other minor allowances provided for the football play-
ers on athletic scholarships (the rifle team never received
‘any scholarships) for one semester alone mustbe several
times that. “Well football pays for itself” is their retort.
Somehow I was always under the delusion that college
sports were an honorable and pleasurable pastime meant
mostly for fun and enjoyment rather than profit. Evidently
the athletic program at Pitt is as much as business as it is
at U.C.L.A., Ole Miss, Texas or any other pro football fac-

tory in the country.

If this is the cas'e,,then I fail to perceive how the de-
« partment can justify spending thousands of dollars on such

annual losers (financially as

well as statistically) as the

swimming, gymnastics and tennis teams while refusing to,
budget one cent for rifle (divisional champs two years
ago) and ice hockey (4-3-1). Or are some of these “margin-
al sports” also being readied for a similar fate on the
financial chopping block imposed by Posvar on the Athle-‘

tic Department?

Oh. well at least Athletic Director Casmir Myslinski '

_ is keeping his promise when he came here “that there will
be no suchthing as minor sports at Pitt.” Of course there

ble for play due to a mixup and
misunderstanding with Dean
Dunkelberger of C.A.S. Theo-
filos will be missed the most
as Bemis described him as "a
potential All-American."

Theofilus proved it this past
summer when» he scored all six
goals in a 6-1 rout of one of
America’s best amateur teams.
He also scored twice Against
a German pro team at Three
Rivers in June.

Also a problem for Bemis may
be the goaltender’s position
which was vacated by the grad-
uation of Kerry Krause. Steve
Fibel, a junior, is listed as the
starter but he is having knee
problems. If he’s incapacitated
sophomore Bill Haines will be
given the nod‘. Haines is a form-’
er fullback from Washington,
Pa. '

The fullback and halfback
positions are strong with. eight
of the nine eligible. defenders

being lettermen. The only ‘non-.

letterman is junior Larry Skal-
ski of Fox Chapel who is a half-
back/fullback. In all Bemis has
ten returning lettermen he can
count on in his small fifteen man
varsity lineup.

‘Bruins. , ‘

He remembered the jolts that made his weak-
ened knees give way, causing him to miss most
of the 1968 and 1970 seasons, and he wondered if

it might happen this year, too.

By the time the game got ‘underway, Cin-
drich managed to put aside hisfears, saying to
himself, “I really have nothing to lose. If it hap-

pens, it happens.”
He recalled later,

suddenly it went away.”

The Panthers upset UCLA, 29-25, and Cind-
rich was named Lineman of the Week by the As-
sociated Press, the first one in the young sea-
son. He was credited with eight tackles, four as-
sists and two recovered fumbles-which the Pan-

thers turned into touchdowns.

In 1969, still a sophomore because he receiv-
ed an injury red-shirt, he made 13 tackles, again
against UCLA, and went on to lead the Panthers
in tackles in eight of 10 games.‘ He was named to

the AP’s All-East team.

Last year — once again against UCLA — Cin-
drich injured his other knee on the first defensive

play of the game.

He tried to come back three games later and
played the first half against Navy — he was nam-
ed. to the Middies All-Opponent team — but the
knee had to be operated on and he missed the

rest of the season.

“I guess I’m a little afraid to look ahead,”
the 6—foot-1, 228-pound senior said. “I don't want _
to think.what might happen. But, you know some-
thing, I never got injured when I was hit.

“They’ve come from trying to adapt to the ar-
tificial turf. I think I-’ve found something that

“On the first couple of
series I was nervous, scared to get hit. Then

Coach Craig Reynolds of
Bucknell can counter with twelve
lettermen out- of a roster of
twenty-five players. The Strong
spot on the squad according to
Reynolds is theoffense which he
rates as "my strongest offense in
years. They are capable of scor-
ing and only need experience.

“I’m hoping for a team ef-
fort up front and looking for a
good distribution of scoring.
For the _first time in years
we’re not counting on one man,”
states Reynolds.

Weak spot on the team may
be the defense as two of Buck-
nell‘s backfield booters are in-
jured including captain Larry
Greenwood, a halfback. and full-
back Mike N ovak.

._ »‘

Thus it appears as if the game
will be a contest between Buck- ‘
nell’s explosive offense (which
beat St. Francis 8-0 last week)
and Pitt’s stingy defense (in- ’
tact except for the goalie) which
only allowed an average of 1.6
goals per game last year.

If the Pitt defense can .play
as well as they did last year and
the offense can score some goals
then the booters will finally
beat Bucknell for the first time
in four years.

The game is at 2 p.m. iii‘ the
Stadium and admission is free
and open to everyone. Soccer
Coach Bemis and his booters‘ are
hoping that they finally get
some student support this year
and invite all sports fans to the
opening - game of their 1971
season.

This weekend at Warren, Ohio.

the Pitt road racing team will
.,,continue their quest for an invita-
" tion to the ‘American Road Race
of_,Champions.
 "The American Road Race of
S" Champions is the World Series in
7-the sport car world, and Bob Fry-
 er, the driver of the modified Ca-
gﬁmaro. would like very much for
T the team to go.

. "The crew (all the students who
_ are active members of the club)
5- deserve an invitation to ‘the Race’

 have done."

Due to chronic engine problems,
 he Pitt team has fallen to fifth
' place in the standings. Before the
“race at Bryan, N. H., the team had
"a firm hold on second place. At
that time they were unable to
. compete in the race and three
.— other racers moved ahead of them
. in the standings.

Larry Dent still maintained
“ first place in his B. F. Goodyear
Firebird. Warren Agar, 1970
f Rookie Driver of the Year, moved
_.into second place with 25 points
* well behind Dent‘s 35. Ed Glanz
A and Kent Fellows moved ahead of
 the team with 23 points apiece and
- tied for third place. The Pitt team
' maintained their 19 points but fell
from second to fifth.

,_ The engine has been the biggest
' single detrimental factor to the
5 performance of the car the past
five weeks according to Fryer.
” "We qualified for,the pole posi-
: tion four out of the last five races
 but had to drop out of the race in
, all five due to engine failure.”

This problem might have been
alleviated due to an engine
change. The car will be powered
by an engine from Auto Research
Engineering of Troy, Mich., rather
than the Greenwood Corporation’s
. engine which was responsible for
the previous five failures.

THE UNIVERSITY of Pittsburgh Road Racing Team's Camaro will be competing this weekend in an-

other National Championship race in Warren, Ohio. Needing points to better their present fifth placei

standing for a post season invitational promises to make this race even more exciting for the Pitt team.

The engine will have to be up to
par because the best competition
in the Northeastern division will
be competing over the course of
the four final races. Fryer men-
tioned that "everyone will be out
for points for an invitation to
Atlanta.”

This week’s race at Warren,
Ohio, and another race also in
Warren next weekend will be fol-
lowed by the final two in Indiana-
polis, Ind., and Winchester, Va.,
the next two weekends.

“Ifwe have as much good luck
the next four races as the bad luck
we have had the lastlfour, hope-

fully we’ll get an invitation,” he
remarked.

Sue Power, public relations di-
rector, stated that the team is
taking a bus to the race this week-
end. The transportation is pro-
vided free with students being
picked up at the Towers lobby this
Friday the 17th at 6 p.m. Lodg-
ings have been arranged at the
Korb Guest House, "Kent State
University, for $3 a person two
people to a room.

A three dollar admission rate
has been arranged for Pitt stu-
dents rather than the five dollar
charge at the track. She added

that “the interest and enthusiasm
is fantastic of the new members
of the Road Racing Team. In the
recent membership drive more
than 200 people have filled out
applications along with the pre-
sent membership of 100 people.”

“I believe there is more than
adequate talent to compete with
the finest racing teams in the
country right here on this cam-
pus," Fryer interjected. “Experi—
ence.has been developed when
they have worked themselves out
of many difficult situations during
the races. A lot has been done but
there is still a need for more
help."

(AP.)~The Pittsburgh Pirates
moved another step closer to the
National League Eastern Divi-
sion title Thursday night, defeat-
ing the second—place St. Louis
Cardinals 6-1 behind the com-
bined seven-hit pitching of Luke
Walker and Ramon Hernandez.

The Pirates lead the Cardin-
als by 91/2 games and any combin-
ation of three Pirate victories
and three Cardinal losses’ will
clinch the pennant.

In the thire Jerry Reuss walk-
, ed both Walker and Rennie Sten-
nett with one out and Gene
Clines singled to load the bases.
Roberto Clemente drove in one
run with a sacrifice fly and
Manny Sanguillen singled in
another run. '
A three-base error by center
fielder Jose Cruz paved the way
for two Pirate runs in the fourth.

A1 Oliver was hit by a pitch
and Jack Hernandez singled to
center but the ball went through
Cruz to the wall as both runners
scored. Walker drew another
walk and Stennett singled.

Hernandez replaced Walker,
9-8, in the sixth with the bases
loaded and one out and retired
the side with a run scoring on
an infield out by Lou Brock.

The Pirates matched that run
-in their seventh when Clines
singled, stole second went to
third on a passed ball and scor-
ed on a double by Bob Robert-

Two Panther gridders are on
the verge of breaking two all-
time Pitt career records although
they have played just little more
than two seasons.

Dave Havern, senior quarter-
back for the squad, needs only
17 more passing yards to surpass
Ken Lucas, who was the Pan-

coach John Michelosen, Lucas

When Havern was a sopho-

for 1,810 yards. Last season when
he split the signal calling duties
with John Hogan, Dave racked
up another 638 yards.

With the 93 yards Havern

” Steelers Clash With Chicago;
Four Rookies Slated To Start

by MARK SIGMON

Opening their 1971-72_ Nation-
al Football League season this
Sunday against the Bears in Chi-
cago, the Pittsburgh Steelers,
fresh from a 3-2 exhibition slate,
will probably have four rookies
in the starting defensive lineup.

Dwight White, Glen Edwards,
and Mike Wagner are three
first—year men~sure to test the
bruising Bear offense, Line-

backer’ Jack Ham is the possible

fourth freshman starter.

White beatout veteran Ben Mc-
Gee to earn the defensive right
end spot. Edwards and Wagner
moved out last year’s incumbents,
Mel Blount and Chuck Beatty, at
the right and left safety posi-
tions.

Despite a solid performance
last'Sunday against the New York
Giants, including three pass in-

terceptions, Ham is not assured
of taking the field at Chicago
as the Steelers’ left linebacker.
Veteran Henry Davis, sidelined
for a couple contests with a

~ shoulder injury,-. is ready to re-

sume action. Coach Chuck Noll

r-I‘

 

must decide who will get the
starting nod. 

_ Quarterback Terry Bradshaw
directs the balanced offensive
attack. Bradshaw hit on 54 or 98
passes for 749 yards and eight
touchdowns during the Steelers’
exhibition season. More impor-
tant, the Louisiana Tech gradu-
ate only hurled four intercep-
tions in the same five game per-
iod. .

Meanwhile, running backs
John “F_renchy” Fuqua and
Preston Pearson grounded out
494 yards in the pre-season tilts
to complement Bradshaw’s aer-
ial exploits. '

The only new face for the
Steeler offense from the 1970
starters is tackle Jon Kolb. Kolb,
an All-Big 8 performer for the
Oklahoma State Cowboys, switch-
ed from his former center po-
sition. ‘

Three Bear starters who miss-
ed most of the team’s six exhi-
bition games, Gale Sayers, Dick

Tulane’s Green Wave may have
a tough time stopping Georgia’s
sophomore quarterback Andy

‘Bulldogs, led by the passing of the
rookie, totaled 56 points against

One of the main reasons for the

the 400- total yards for WVU on
offense, Wood accounted ‘for 214

Bears were clobbered by Arkan-
sas, 51-20, in the first game,
California was leading 13-7 late in
the first half before the Razor-
backs gained momentum.

Florida State,_who will be Pitt‘s
final foe this fall, battles intra-
state rival Miami. Finally, Okla-
homa, tenth ranked in the coun-
try, runs up against a Southwest
Conference club, Southern Metho-
dist. The Sooners start the year
with 16 returning starters from
last season.

Navy football coach Rick For-
zano didn’t promise any miracles
for the game with Penn State Sat-
urday, but he did assure his week-
ly‘ news conference that Navy
would try to play “a respectable
game" against the Nittany Lions.-

It will be the season opener__f_c_)£

Penn State and Navy is rated a
28-point underdog. -

The Midshipmen were tromped,
55-7, in last year’s game.

Navy squeaked by Virginia, 10-
6, last weekend in a game marred
by fumbles and interceptions, and
Forzano had some harsh words to
say about criticism he has receiv-
ed concerning that victory.

“I get the impression some-*

times that, you know, people feel
sorry for us when we lose, but
they kinda’ resent us when we
win.

“People talk about a crummy
game and everything else, and I
think they're kind of downgrad-
ing kids. '_

“‘You can downgrade me any-
time, because that’s my profes-
sion. But when you downgrade
kids-and it seemslike some peo-
ple just want to take a potshot at
Academy kids and military young
men today-— really feel that that’s
all wrong. And when you talk
about a crummy game, why, heck,
it was played under crummy con-
ditions.

“Let me put it to you this way.
That field was terrible because it

was wet. Virginia wasn't to blame '

for that.” -

This little slipstick
could increase your

typing speed
by two or three days.

Students will be elated over a completely new
_way to correct typing errors: Liquid Paper’s® new

When you're typing the big one, the 30-page
paper you've been sweating for weeks, that's when
mistakes bug you the most. So you slo_w _down.
And the closer you get to the bottom of the page,
the more you clutch up. Mess up now and you’ve '
got a whole page to retype.

When you’ve got a slipstick handy, you don't
worry about mistakes. One easy touch releases a
special fluid that buries the mistake and leaves a
clean new surface like the paper itself.

So you type relaxed. And make fewer mistakes.
On the big assignments, Liquid Paper's new slip-
stick could put you days ahead.

ASK FOR LIQUID PAPER SLIPSTICK AT YOUR
BOOKSTORE OR ORDER DIRECT WITH THIS COUPON.

Liquid Paper slipsticks @ $1.25 ea.
