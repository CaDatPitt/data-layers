Search committee looking at l 3 candidates
for dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences

Kris Kissel

Contributing Editor

Pitt is searching for a new leader for
its biggest school —— someone to replace
Peter Koehler who has served 'as Faculty
of Arts and Sciences dean for 12 years.
Thirteen applicants were selected as can-
didates for further review, including two
internal candidates from Pitt.

The committee will narrow the ﬁeld
to three to ﬁve candidates by Jan. 1,
according to search com-
mittee chair Edward
Stricker, at which time
Provost James Maher will
make the ﬁnal decision of
who becomes the new FAS
dean;

This search is one of
the most important issues
happening in the University

Maher.

"It's really the central
academic unit," he said.
"The professional schools, I
think without exception, are
based on academic work
that ﬁnds its home in Arts
and Sciences."

Stricker agreed that the
search is of the utmost
importance to the
University community.

"I think the search for
the next dean is something
that is terriﬁcally important
for the University of
Pittsburgh and for the
Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, and therefore for
everybody in CAS, includ-
ing the students," he said.
"It should therefore be of
keen interest who this next
dean is."

Current FAS Dean
Peter Koehler, who
announced his resignation
last fall, will remain in
ofﬁce until this summer,
when his replacement will take over.

Koehler said that 12 years as dean
have been enough.

"It's time to move on to other things
and to give new leadership to FAS," he
said. "You can do things your way for so
long, and then a new approach is need ."

He said

The search for a new dean began last
spring when the provost formed the search
committee of 11 members, including eight
faculty members, four of whom were cho-
sen by a faculty vote and four who were
appointed by Provost Maher. Stricker was
elected by faculty vote and then was asked
by the provost to chair the committee.

"They're all very respected profes-
sors," said Maher of the faculty members
on the committee. Commenting on those
he appointed personally, hesaid, "I was
looking for very good profes-
sors who would balance out
the committee." ,

Though members of the
committee seem to represent
a broad range of University
departments, Stricker says
they're not there to represent
departments at all.

"Departments were not
chosen; people were chosen,"
said Stricker. "They were
speciﬁcally asked not to rep-
resent their departments. The
committee represents the
University, and you're sup-
posed to leave your depart-
mental afﬁliations at the door
when you come into the com-
mittee room and speak as a
citizen of the University
about what you think would
be in FAS‘ best interests."

In addition to faculty
members, Maher also
appointed to the committee
undergraduate student Justin
DalMolin of the Student
Government Board, graduate
student Chris Briem from the
Graduate Student
Organization, and Babs
Mowery of the Staff
Association Council.

Once it was chosen, the
committee placed ads in six
periodicals that Stricker said
are likely to be seen by acad-
emics throughout the country.
Stricker also sent a letter to
the faculty on campus inviting them to
apply or to nominate somebody else for
the position.

The search committee also sent hun-
dreds of letters to provosts of other univer-
sities, asking them to nominate persons at

Vandals strike Columbus
statue in Schenley Park

Brett Taylor
News Assistant

"Murderer!"

"Stolen land!"

On the eve of Columbus Day,
these were the words vandals spray-
painted on the base of the 50-foot-tall
bronze statue of Christopher
Columbus near Phipps Conservatory
in Schenley Park.

The vandals bombarded the statue
with glass bulbs containing bright red
paint. The bulbs, which hit the statue's
hand, face and stomach, left dripping
red paint resembling spewed blood on

the artwork's body and base. Chips of
broken glass bulbs and streamers of

red paint ﬂoated in the fountain water
surrounding the statue.

Although nobody knows when the
vandals struck, the graffiti was there
when members of the
Columbus met at the statue to dedi-
cate the opening of a new Oakland
chapter on Sunday.

Monday afternoon, workers from
the city graffiti team, the Phipps
Conservatory grounds crew, a few
city department supervisors and some

part-time city workers gathered
around the statue to assess the damage
and determine a plan for cleaning it.

John Radcliffe, city Construction
Division supervisor, said it could take
as many as 10 days and cost the city
nearly $20,000 to restore the statue to
its original condition. ,

"It [$20,000] might be a little
high," Radcliffe said. "But after labor
and materials, it will be close."

According to Greg Daley, the
Fourth Division park superviser, a
crew will go to the statue on Tuesday
to set up scaffolding so the workers
can reach the 50-foot heights of the
statue. .

Then, he said, the city's graffiti
crew will start cleaning the statue on
Wednesday. The difficulty the work-
ers face is that the statue itself is
bronze and the base is carved granite,
so the crew cannot use a sand blaster.

Henke spearheaded the crew who set
up sprinklers that will runy24 hours a
day and keep the statue perpetually
wet.

"The water keeps the paint moist,"
Daley said. "It makes it come off eas-
ier." . '

Henke waded through the thigh-
high water of the fountain to secure
the sprinkler heads on the statue's
base, to be sure the water could reach
the sculpture's highest points.

According to Daley, the graffiti
crew, consisting of three or four work-
ers working eight hours a day, will
begin cleaning on Wednesday and
continue until the statue is cleaned.

The statue, which was made in
1958 by sculptor Frank Vittor, was not
the only Christopher ‘Columbus statue
to suffer the wrath of vandals this past
weekend.

Across the Nation

PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. — Federal
investigators are looking for clues into
the plane crash that killed singer John
Denver. Folk singer Mary Travers
says ’Denver’s songs helped
Americans heal the wounds left by the
Vietnam War.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The John
Denver song “Take Me Home,
Country Roads” has become an unof-
ficial state anthem for West Virginia.

The. phrase from that song,
“Almost Heaven, West Virginia,” is
close to the hearts of thousands of res-
idents.

Lena Rideout of Hurricane, W.Va.,
says whenever she heard the song, she
would stop _and think of home.

A The song was co—written by Taffy
Nyvert and her then husband, Bill
Danoff. Nyvert says Denver took the
spirit of ‘‘loving and giving” that
existed in the early 1970s and con-
nected it back home.

She says that she and her husband
toured with Denver as the record
became popular. They would open the

show for him, and come back to join
in “Country Roads” as the encore. She
says it was “quite spectacular and
fun.” -

GERLACH, Nev. —— Close, but no
cigar in the first effort yesterday to
break the speed of sound on land.

A British jet-powered car raced

_ down a 13-mile track in the Nevada

desert — and the car’s owner, Richard
Noble, says there was actually a sonic
boom.

But initial timing reports show
that the car missed achieving the
speed of sound, around 760 mph, by
just a tiny fraction.

The driver says this morning’s run
was a smooth one.

- PHILADELPHIA —— Nineteen peo-

ple are being treated for mostly minor

injuries following an accident involv— I

ing a city bus in Philadelphia. The
crash occurred just before noon at the
intersection of Washington Lane and
Thouron Street, in the city’s West Oak
Lane section. Witnesses say a Septa
bus was hit by a small, private bus
traveling erratically down the street.

their home institutions who might be consid-
ered appropriate candidates.

The committee chose the current group of
13 candidates from a much larger pool that had
applied for the position. Stricker said the num-
ber of applicants exceeded his expectations.

"When we ﬁrst started to send out letters,
we guessed how many responses we expected

to receive, and this number is 50 percent high-

er," he said.

Stricker was quick to note his happiness
with the quality of the candidates.

"It's not just numbers — the quality of the
people who applied is very good,” he said. “We
invited 13, but we could have invited 26. We've
already had to eliminate people who are prob-
ably very good candidates, but we think we
have ones who are even better."

The invitations Stricker spoke of consti-
tute the second phase of the search. Candidates
will come to Pitt for a three-hour interview
with the search committee. _

Based on those interviews, the resume and
cover letter that applicants submitted already,
and letters of recommendation from persons
selected by the candidates, the search commit-
te'ewillcutthegroupagaintosixtoeightcan-
didates. Stricker said the committee will make
the second cut by the second week of
November.

After the second cut, the remaining candi-
dates will be invited to spend two days on Pitt's
campus meeting several faculty members,
administrators, staﬁ and students. Stricker said
the visit will allow the committee to evaluate
the candidates further, and also allow candi-
dates to evaluate the University.

At that time, the names of candidates will
be available, but until then, the committee is
keeping the list of candidates secret.

"This is a conﬁdential process," said
Stricker. "All of the candidates for this position
have a job. If they were to let it be known that
they are looking to leave, that would destabi-
lize the situation at their home position."

Stricker added, "Almost none of the peo-
ple who apply for the position will get it —
only one person will get it. If those people are
going to continue to function well at their home
position, it will be easiest for them if nobody
knew they had ever applied in the ﬁrst place. If
they are willing to let us evaluate‘ their creden-
tials, the least we can do is not to tell anybody
that we didn't think they were good enough."

FROM PAGE 1
Though he says he does not know who the

candidates are, Provost Maher declined to .

comment on who he thinks might make good
internal candidates. ‘

"It really wouldn't be appropriate for me to
suggest names," said Maher. "I've tried very
hard to protect the integrity of the search
process and the responsibility of the search
comrni ." ,

When the six to eight candidates come to
campus for the second round of interviews,

however, their names will be released to the

public.

Of that group, a third cut will be made,
reducing the group to three to ﬁve candidates.
Stricker says the last out will be made by Jan.
1, and then the selection will be in Provost
Maher's hands.

"Once the committee gives me a short list,
it's really a list of people whom I am authorized
to recruit," said Maher.

Although Chancellor Nordenberg is the
highest—leve1 administrator at Pitt, the deans are
selected by the provost since he will be the per-
son to whom the new dean will answer.

Candidates will, however, have met with
both Maher and Nordenberg by that point in
the process. ‘

"The ﬁnal candidates will have met with
both me and the chancellor," said Maher.
"Candidates wouldn't want to continue the
process by that point if they hadn't." _

Maher says he is very happy with the state
of the search committee's progress. "There
have been periodic updates to me through the
chair," he noted "From what Edward Stricker
has told me about the search and the candidates
who have applied, I'm very optimistic about
ﬁnding a good dean."

Stricker says he, too, is pleased with the
search up to this point. ,. I

"At this stage in the process, I can tell you
that I'm very optimistic that we will not only
have a good group of people to give to the
provost, but the provost will be able to make
his selection, and the next dean will be in place
by next summer," said Stricker

Stricker said he is very happy with current
prospects.

"We're likely to see some terriﬁc people,
and that should make everybody feel as opti-
mistic as I am that the next clean is going to be
quite a good person. We're on schedule, and
things look very promising right now."

In-your-face approach scares homophobes

Alison Novickl

 

Norclenberg should
give back the bonus

Pitt gave many Sutherland Hall residents a “bonus” in
the form of over-refunds and then asked for it back

Well, it’s time to ask Chancellor Norrlenberg for his
$30,0()0 bonus back.

Nordenberg already makes $232,00(). His bonus is gra-
tuitous. He should give that money back to the school, and
back for the bettemrent of the University.

The criteria for which the trustees supposedly awarded
the bonus are vague, and we see no evidence that four of
the ﬁve criteria were even met. ‘

But Nordenberg can do something with that bonus to
showusthathewillmeetatleastoneofthosepoints.

If he is seriously in pursuit of undergraduate excel-
lence, he can put that bonus into a scholarship fund and use
it to get even more money from the Pitt community.

Nordenberg should challenge alumni and other
investors to help the pursuit of undergraduate excellence.
The next time he meets with wealthy supporters, he can say,
“I’ve given $30,000 of my own money to a scholarship
fund for Pitt students. I challenge you all to do the same.”

Admitting extra freshman this year and cramming
them into dorm rooms does not constitute a pursuit of
undergraduate excellence, regardless of what their average
SAT scores might be. SAT scores tell you what students did
before they came here, not what this school has enabled
them to do while they were here.

IfNordenberg really wants Pitt’s undergrads to achieve
excellence, he should help them to attain it instead of wav-
' g it off by giving everybody some weak explanation that
he did his job by appointing others to take care of things.

If he wants to show that he’s serious about undergrad-
uate attainment, he can start by using his bonus — extra
moneythatcametohimlikemarmafromheaven—todo
some good

If you as students and faculty agree, we urge you to let
the chancellor know, directly.

Send letters to the chancellor at 107 Cathedral of
Learning.

Or call the chancellor at 624-4200.

Tell the chancellor you want him to prove that he’s
worth a bonus, so that perhaps next year he’ll deserve it

Conservatives have their own form of ’’political correctness”  

Micheal Berqust
Columnlst

One of the most irritating aspects
of the right-wing establishment is its juve-
nile delight in yelling and carrying on
about “political correctness.” It says that
the “politically correct” thought police sti-
ﬂe criticism and rationality everywhere. If
you’re a conservative, the establishment
whines, the PC. police are going to take
you away.

Unfortunately for them, however,
conservatives have their own slight prob-
lem with Big Brotherism as well. They
have shown a remarkable willingness to
attack their own members for independent
thought and criticism. Criticize Speaker
Newt in print? You are a dupe for the lib-
eral media. Dare to deviate" from the party
line? You are a traitor. Welcome to Big
Brotherism for the 1990s.

I’m always amused to hear peo-
ple talk about how much the media and
the liberals love President Clinton. Ha!
The truth is that the media hates President
Clinton. Notice the extraordinary amount
of airtime the media gives to stories about
the president’s personal life over stories
about his policies. During the last election,
‘The Washington Post and The Nev\\>- York
Yimes issued tepid endorsements of the

president, and The Nation magazine, the_

current bastion of pure liberal thought,
endorsed left-wing consumer advocate
Ralph Nader. Liberal media? Please!

' Unfortrmately the right-wingers
in the media use the “liberal media” as an
excuse to act as the Republican leader-
ship’s mouthpiece. George Will, for exam-
ple, coached Ronald Reagan prior to a
1980 presidential debate and then went on
television to lavish praise upon his perfor-
mance, failing to note that his assistance to
the Reagan campaign was a rather serious
violation of journalistic ethics.

But those conservatives who

deviate from the party line and speak their

minds are ostracized for their indepen-
dence.

“[Conservatives] really do labor
under the delusion that liberal commenta-
tors never criticize liberals, which is non-
sense,” notes Robert Novak, a prominent
conservative. ‘To be a columnist or com-
mentator is not to be a cheerleader. Maybe
I’m working under roughly the same ide-
ology-as the people I’m writing about, but
I’m not on their team.” When Novak
wrote a column criticizing Gingrich’s
position on affirmative action, Gingrich
angrily responded at a dinner that he was
“infuriated” with Novak. Infuriated over
what? Expressing his opinion? Last time I

checked, free speech was part of the
Constitution.

A few months ago The Wall
Street Journal declared that Newt
Gingrich was in danger of being “inconse-
quential” (actually, that happened a long,
long time ago). Gingrich responded by
sending every member of the newspaper’s
editorial board a stern note telling them
how very, very disappointed he was with
them. When The Weekly Standard maga-
zine ran an article portraying Gingrich’s
speakership as being in disarray, Gingrich
called into Rush Lirnbaugh’s radio show
to attack the magazine’s editor, William
Kristol, complaining: “I’ve concluded that
he thinks he has to make news by pander-
ing to the liberals every week and has
become sort of the most destructive ele-
ment on the right  I don’t know of any
conservative who is a serious person, who
isn’t, frankly, worried about what’s hap-
pening at The Weekly Standard and
Kristol’s passion for destroying
Republicans.”

But the right’s capacity for intel-
lectual Stalinisrn gets worse. Just a few
years ago, David Brock was the right’s
golden boy when he wrote a book brutally
assailing Anita Hill. Then he broke the
story in the pages of The American
Spectator about the Arkansas state troop-

ers who claimed to have evidence of
President Clinton’s philandering during
his time as governor of Arkansas. Just as
quickly as Brock rose, he suddenly fell
again, becoming an outsider for failing to
sufficiently slander Hillary Rodharn

' Clinton in a book he wrote last year, and

for questioning the journalistic ethics of
his fellow right-wing media cheerleaders.

Disgusted at how hypocritical his V

own side had become, Brock complained,
“Because they had partied at my house, I
was expected to parrot their prejudices and
cover up their secrets.” He went on to note
that compared to liberals, “my side turned
out to be as dirty as theirs.” Brock specu-
lated that the fact that he is a homosexual
also undoubtedly played a part in his
ouster from the right-wing media’s estab-
lishment.

It is ironic that for all of its hatred
of communism, the right-wing establish-
ment has shown itself to share an abiding
trait with authoritarian regimes like that of
the USSR: hatred of any and all kinds of
dissent. Step out of line, and the thought
police will come to take you away. Watch
out fellas. Big Brother is you.

Michael Berquist wants conservatives to
take a good, long look in’ the mirror before
they talk about political correctness. '

Martha Stewart is something of a genius — and a crook

Heather
Barnett

Do you feel that there’s something
missing in your life, an empty place in
your soul? Maybe you write it off to a nag-
ging sense of personal failure, or a lack of
religious conviction, or an overwhelming
sense of helplessness against the immense
problems facing’ the world.

All these possibilities notwithstand-
ing, the real cause of all your problems is
much simpler.

You lack a pair of $45 cookie cutters.

Welcome to the world of Martha
Stewart, variously known as the
“Doyenne of Domesticity,” “Martha
Dearest” or “June Cleaver on Acid.” It’s a
place where simple pleasures like home
cooking and a comfy bed get blown WAY
out of proportion. It’s a place where you
can pass entire days of your short life
painting various bits of plant life an unnat-
ural gold. T

Oh, yeah. It’s also a place where you

‘can get scammed.

Martha, no longer content to ﬂeece
her adoring followers through her broad-
cast and print enterprises, has now
launched herself onto the web. For those
of us who always thought that Martha was
virtually unbelievable, it seems appropri-
ate that you can now get virtual Martha at
her new A website, modestly addressed
www.marthastewart.com.

‘When you reach the site, you are
greeted by a photo of a front door, all
draped in garlands of pine. A letter from
the Boss herself reinforces the not-so-sub-
tle attempt at creating a sense of warmth:
“We want you to move easily from our
front door  to all the ‘rooms’ in our
house....” Martha is trying to convince you
that she is doing you a big favor by allow-
ing you into the privacy of her site. She
considers you a dear friend, after all, and
even signs her letter “Cordially.”

Ifyou continue on, you can ﬁnd tons
of fascinating facts about Martha.
Someone asks what skin-care products
make Martha’s complexion look so “radi-
ant” on TV. The real answer is, “A soft-
focus lens that would make any given
member of the Rolling Stones look 18
again,” but such honesty is forbidden in
Marthaland. (Martha is “an advocate” of
Mario Badescu products, in case the sus-
pense was getting to you.) Martha’s TV
clothes come from‘ The Gap and J. Crew.
And you can get chickens like Martha’s
from the Murray McMurray Hatchery.

Chickens?

Yes. Araucana chickens, actually.

This is where it starts to get truly sur-
real. Once you get to the “Martha by
Mail” merchandising section (and you
will, which you rapidly realize is why a
plebe like you is being allowed to track
dirt all over Martha’s nice, clean cyber-
house), you discover that for $18, you can

get a poster of Martha’s chickens, direct
from the “Palais des Poulet.” (Depending
on whose translation you trust, this means
[either “Chicken Palace” or “Crazy
Martha’s House 0’ Hens.”) If you were

She said

foolish enough to think
that all chickens were
pretty much the same the
world over, and fairly 
plain of face at that, the   1
breathy description will 3}] _i j. 5:; . 
set you straight‘ “With   _4 ,
their astonishing color   E  ‘C
and speckled, iridescent   A.
plumage, the apparent 
personalities of Martha’s I '
chickens range from 
stately and majestic to
downright cornic....”

(NOTE TO SELF: “The Majestic
Chickens” would be a great name for a
band.) .

“Aha!” you say. “Where’s the scam?
These chicken posters might be weird, but
they sure are reasonably priced!”

Granted, Martha has the best price
going on poultry pinups, but it all goes
downhill from there. There’s a seemingly
endless array of the aforementioned 2/$45
cookie cutter sets. A collection of cake-
decorating equipment that would run
about $30 max at any kitchen—goods store
goes for $65. You don’t even want to
know about the $99 Garden Tool Bag Kit.

After all that baking, gardening, and

2
i

 

tending to small livestock, you’re going to
be a bit mucky. Never fear! Martha is
ready to meet all your cleanliness needs
with three pounds of unscented glycerin
soap for just $24. Tl1at’s right — for about
the same per—pound price
as fresh jumbo shrimp,
you too can have  soap!
The site has been a suc-
cess so far, if the number
V of visitors is any indica-

over half a million hits
per week since its launch.
How many of these are
paying customers
remains to be seen.
Martha herself is wildly
optimistic; she is quoted
in the Oct. 6 issue of Time as believing that
an audience of 20 million (!) should yield
about $1,000 in sales each (!!), bringing
her $20 billion gross (! ! l).

The phenomenon of Martha Stewart
is remarkable to say the least. If nothing
else, shehas succeeded in creating a pret-
ty cushy living for herself.

Seemingly without reason, she has
garnered a remarkably small amount of
bad press. For a dissection of the reasons»
behind this, watch for a future column.

It’ll be a good thing.

Kicking game
  kills the  

p Panthers

What was the worst aspect of
Pitt’s loss to the Fighting Irish on
Saturday?

Well,_ it wasn’t the offense. It put
up 21 points. .

It wasn’t the defense. It played
against a Notre Dame offensive line
that averaged close to 300 pounds.
The Panthers were undersized at
nearly every position on the field.

It wasn’t the coaching. Walt
Harris and company had a good
game plan, but big plays by the Irish
and mistakes--. by Pitt sealed the
Panthers’ chances of beating, Notre
Dame for the first time since 1987.

In a game where you-are under-
sized and athletically ovenmatched,
there can be no mistakes on special-
teams plays.

And the special teams (more
specifically, the kicking game) were
disgusting. Itwas an obvious disad-
vantage for,Pitt all game.

And it began on the ‘opening 1
kickoff. Right-footed Paul Ruzila.

started the game with a line-drive
squibber that bounded off the turf

and then off Irish return specialist’

Allen Rossum. It looked like a
decent kick, but then he scooped it

upand went unmolested for a 93-

yard touchdown.

A kickoff should do exactly that
— go “off” of the ground, at least
more than 15 feet in the air, and land

I somewhere behind the 10-yard line. I
If Ruzila meant to squib it, he ’
should have kicked away from the ~

returner, notright at him. The liner
right at Rossum gave the would-be
tacklers little time to get down field,
and converge on the ball. After
Rossum dodged the first man, it was
easy going because no one else was
in position to make the play except
for Ruzila, who made a feeble dive
at Rossum’s jockstrap.

The kickoffs were lackluster,
and Chris Ferencik’s miss of a 32-
yard field goal was not only unbe-
lievable, but also was a tremendous
shift in momentum for Notre Dame
that Pitt couldn’t afford.

After giving up two early touch-
downs, Pitt’s defense stiﬂed Notre
Dame on its next two possessions.

Lady Panthers down Rutgers,

Staff Wrlter

Panther Women’s
Volleyball Head Coach
Cindy Alvear believes that
the » University of
Pittsburgh can strike fear in
opponents with its tradition
alone. She tries to instill
that idea in her team before
matches.

It worked this past
weekend. The Pittsburgh

to 9-7 with a pair of come-
from-behind road wins
against Seton Hall and
Rutgers. .

“Before the Seton Hall

Lucky bounces, a few good breaks

1 and plenty of bruises capped off the Pitt

hockey tearn’s opening weekend of
play as the Panthers traveled to Indiana
University of Pennsylvania to compete
in the school’s season-opening tourna-
ment.

Competing in the tournament were
Pitt, IUP, Rutgers University and the

‘Pittsburgh Junior Stars. The Panthers
were scheduled to play Shippensburg

University Friday night, but upon arriv-
ing in Indiana, they discovered that
Shippensburg had dropped out of the

9 tournament because the school’s hock-

ey team had folded. Shippensburg’s
entry was replaced by the Stars, a
junior “C” team consisting of 18- to 21-
year-old players.

Pitt didn’t underestimate the Stars,
as evidenced by the 5-4 score of the
ensuing Panther victory. The Stars
played a tight offensive game, and it
took a come-from-behind effort to give
the Panthers their ﬁrst win of the sea-
son.
Andy Mecs opened scoring for the

Panthers, winning a face-off in the
Stars zone and putting the puck in the
net for the early lead. The Stars jumped
out to a 2-1 lead, but forward Bill
Maclean scored the Panthers’ second
goal on a sound pass from Dave Fryer,
who skated from the comer boards and
dished the puck off to Maclean, who
tied the game.. Fryer finished the game
with two assists.

Both teams took the 2-2 tie into the
locker room after the second period,
but the Stars jumped out to a 4-2 lead in
the third. When Pitt could have given
up, it instead rallied with a strong phys-
ical game and lots of shooting, begin-
ning with Kris Getzik’s~ goal, a slap
shot that bounced off the goalie’s arm
and into the net. Ryan Moore's power-
play conversion, a slap shot from the
top of the face-off circle, tied the game
at four.

The Panthers capitalized on the
power play once again near the end of
the game. ‘A lucky shot by wing Jake
Polachak bounced off the post and into
the net, giving the Panthers the victory.

“It was our ﬁrst game of the sea-
son, we were down going into the third
period, and luckily we got a power play

Pitt hockey splits season-opening matchups

and came back on it from being down
two goals,” Moore said. ,
The next afternoon wasn’t as fruit-

' ful for. the Panthers. Pitt took on rival.

IUP and got exactly what it expected: a
tough, physical game.

The score of the 6-0 whitewash,
Pitt’s ﬁrst loss of the season, didn’t
indicate the full intensity of the game.
Contrary to the score, Pitt gave IUP a
tough challenge, but mostly a physical
challenge. The physical game, IUP’s
bread and butter, combined with the
offense, gave IUP the all-around edge
in the contest.

“We hit well, we came out and we
were all over them, but we just didn’t
shoot,” admitted Moore. “Against IUP
we didn’t have it together. We came out
of the game all bruised up. They were
really physical, and they just outplayed
us.”

The shooting game is what made
the biggest difference. IUP took 55
shots in 60 minutes, compared to Pitt’s
anemic offense, which managed only
13 shots.

In two periods of play, Pitt goalie
Pat Kenny faced 37 shots, but made a

Irish quarterback Ron Powlus want-
ed to show the Pitt fans what
they’ve been missing for the last

~ four years, and heaved a ball down-

field while on the run.

Unfortunately for Powlus, no
one was open, except for defensive
backs John Jenkins and Hank
Poteat. They reverted to their child-
hood by playing a quick game of
“hot potato” that ended in a Poteat
interception and a return to Notre
Dame’s 8—yard line.

Now, Pitt is down 14-0 and is on
the doorstep of scoring a touch-
down. After a couple of question-
able calls, namely a fullback sweep
to the short side of the field, and a
dropped pass by tight end John
Jones in the back of the end zone,
Ferencik jogged in to miss a
straight—ahead 32—yarder that would
have at least put Pitt on the board."

Ferencik had just one attempt on
Saturday. His miss was his second
of the year, and he is now 4 for 6
with not one attempt of more than
37 yards.

Up to this point, Pitt’s kicking
game had cost the Panthers 10
points (a missed field goal and a
kickoff return) in a 14-0 game.

On the opening possession of
the second half, Pete Gonzalez was

sacked for more than 10 yards. This X

forced a punt from inside the _10—
yard line. In this situation, a team

needs a booming kick to get some"

field position back and to give the
defensesome room to play.
First—year punter Grant Coffield

= took the snap-and shanked a wobbler

into the air. It traveled only to the
Pitt 40-yard line. This put the Irish
in immediate field goal range; they

 converted a 22-yard kick seven

plays later.

There’s another three points, so.

now‘ the total is up to 13 points in a
17-0 game. The travesty is that Pitt
would then march down the field for

a touchdown. The score was” 17-7, '

but with some better kicking, Pitt
should have been up 10-7 midway
through the third quarter.

The final insult committed by .

the kicking game was Ruzila’s
onside—kick attempt, which resulted
in another Irish return for a touch-
down. That’s a 20-point difference
due to the kicking game.

Perhaps the football team should
stop the ads in The Pitt News for
offensive and defensive linemen,
and should instead plaster the news-
paper with ads for kickers and pun-
ters. Someone on this
should be able to consistently punt a
ball farther than 30 yards.

Davis nels 100111 career win versus Clarion

Robert J. Kidwell

Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers tennis
team cruised to a 9-0 victory last
Friday over Clarion University ‘to

move to 5-3 on the year, but the win 1

was only a sidebar to the history that

was made on the courts at the Cost»

Sports Center.

With her 6-2, 6-1 victory at her
newfound No. 4 singles seed, Fran
Davis forever imprinted her name in
the Pitt record book, becoming only
the second woman in Panther history
to eclipse the 100-win mark for com-
bined singles and doubles play.

“Fran is now part of an elite
group,” commented Coach George
Dieffenbach.

A group, according to the record
book, whose only other member is

1993 graduate Julie Coprinzi, who

holds the school’s all—time record for
wins with 116 since the team’s incep-
tion in 1975. .

The ex—Panther closest to the
“100-win club” is 1995 graduate
Marlo Zalinski, who finished her
career here at Pitt with 93 match vic-
tories.

“Fran brokethis record because of

her balanced approach to the game.

She was equally successful in singles
and in doubles, which means she got a
lot of points for the team, which is
what it all comes down to,” said
Dieffenbach.

With her 100 wins, and her “bal—
anced approach to the game” Davis is
slated to break Coprinzi’s record early
in the spring semester, according to
Dieffenbach.

“There are a lot of matches left,
and she has a good shot at it,” added
Dieffenbach.

Playing lower in the lineup, No. 4,
than in years past, Davis’ chances of
reaching this milestone are even
greater because she now faces lower-
ranked opponents.

“Reaching this mark is definitely
an honor because only "one girl has
ever done it before,” said Davis. “My
next goal is to pass [Coprinzi] in total
wins, and playing lower in the lineup
should enable me to get more singles
wins in addition to my doubles wins.”

Her doubles wins were what got
her to this prestigious level, according
to Davis.

L “Doubles was how I got most of
my wins. [Team] matches oftentimes
come down to the doubles matches, so
they are very important. Singles is
also very important, but is also very

difficult, especially at the top of the __
lineup,” said Davis.

Davis gives much of the credit for
her success to her past and current
doubles partners.

“Last year I teamed a lot with
Dana" Shalbrack, and we were very
successful. We were almost able to

"claim an Eastern Regional ranking,

but fell just short. This year is much
the same, although I’ve partnered with
a couple different girls,” said Davis.

Davis’ breaking of the record was
a surprise to her. She noted, “I did not
even know about it until just recently.
But it is a big deal.” .

Asked about her chances to break
the record, Coach Dieffenbach said
that “Fran definitely has a good
chance of breaking the record as long
as she keeps improving and working
hard.”

Davis has about a month to bask
in the glory of her accomplishment.
She and the rest of the Lady Panthers
are not slated to compete until the
Rolex Invitationals held at William
and Mary University at the beginning
of November.

That tournament will precede the
Pitt Invitational, to be held in mid-
February, before the women resume

only three goals. Kenny left the game
with less than six minutes left in the sec-
ond period after sustaining a mild con-‘A
cussion.

“The guy came in on a breakaway,
and from what I was told, I stopped the
puck, and it was under me,” Kenny
explained. “There was a collision, my
helmet ﬂew off and as I fell I hit the
back of my head on the crossbar. It was
a bad situation.” I

Kenny was replaced by Dave
Ciarletta, who gave up three goals on 18
shots in the third period. Kenny’s team-
mates gave the injured goalie much
credit for his performance.

“The best part of Saturday’s game
was our goalie’s play and the hitting
aspect,” Moore said, agreeing with his
team. “But IUP was tough. We played
them real well, and they were tough,

“Everyone is beat up right now,”
said Kenny. “They were a much bigger
team..We have to start hitting and send
the message that we’re not going to be
pushed around.”

Pitt will face IUP two more times
this season, in the home opener on Oct.
26, and on Dec. 12, at IUP. The first
home game is at 9 p.m. at the South
Side Neville Arena.
