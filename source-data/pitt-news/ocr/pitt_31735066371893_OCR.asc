Student Government Board
overrules Allocations decision

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
overruled an Allocations Commit-
tee recommendation and passed
their budget Wednesday by a seven-
to-one margin. The decision not to
accept the modifications suggested
by the Allocations Committee gives
the SGB an additional $1,000.

Submitted for review two weeks
ago, the budget contained three
items that were disputed by the Allo-
cations Committee.

The first item, the allotment of
$2,000 for unrestricted travel, was
approved last week by the board
after a planning session with the
Allocations Committee. In that ses-
sion, an agreement was reached that
the funds would only be approved if

they were accounted for and not left
unrestricted.

The second and third items of dis-
pute regarded the budgeting of
$1,000 for the President’s Discre-
tionary Fund and the Contingency
Fund. Allocations recommended
only $500 for each of these funds.

The President's ‘Discretionary
Fund, according to Allocations
Committee chairman John Ben-
choff, is for the president’s use when
the allocations process is not func-
tioning normally, such as in the
summer.

“It [the discretionary fund] is for
things that need to be done quickly,”
said SGB president Luke Kluchko.
Kluchko added that the fund covers
any underestimations that may have
been made in preparing the budget.

Benchoff said that his committee
argued the amount because the
funds had been misused in the past.

“They [past presidents] thought

discretionary meant for their own
discretion,” Benchoff said. “It has
been used for other things that
should not have been bought.”

Although the Contingency Fund
should be used when the allocations
process is not quick enough, it is
primarily for the incoming president
who takes office in January.

Avery Abrams was the only board
member to vote against the unmodi-
ﬁed budget.

In other business, the board
announced that packets on their
letter-writing campaign will be dis-
tributed on April 2 and 3. The goal
of the campaign is to get students to
write their congressmen about Rea-
gan’s proposed student aid cuts.

Judicial Board chairman Jay
Nally also announced that applica-
tions for next year’s Judicial Board
positions are now available. The
deadline for application is Monday
at 5 p.m. .

to the apprehension of this accused
rapist. There are no suspects at this
time since the case was only assigned
Tuesday morning.

According to Hahalyak, this inci-

Faculty calls final
plan reasonable

in

By Vicld Zeltner
The Pitt News

The Pitt administrations final
recommendations for the universi-
ty’s Five-year Plan are much more
reasonable than previous recom-
mendations, according to Pitt
faculty who spoke at yesterday's
public hearing on the provost’s plan-
ning process. However, the faculty
expressed concern that the planning
process involved little consultation
with faculty, thus resulting in inac-
curate departmental evaluations
and faculty divisiveness. .

Professor Edward Powell and
Professor Virgil Cantini, represent-
ing the studio arts department, ques-
tioned the legitimacy of the
recommendations made toward
their department, which may face
decreased funding, administrative
merging with other departments or
elimination.

Cantinicharged that it was an

insult to rush through such a reor- ‘

ganization plan without full partici-
pation of faculty. Powell claimed
that no one had met with him or any
other member of the department to
discuss the recommendations.
Powell pointed out that the “plan-
ning committees and faculty are not

really aware of what studio arts is
and what it does.” Powell and Can-
tini said they found it paradoxical
that the fine arts departmnt, which
in most schools is a sub-department
of the creative and visual arts,
received highly positive , support
while studio arts was recommended
for possible elimination.

“The new provost walks in here
and in one year's time claims to
know our university!” Cantini said.
“Creativity is the foundation of a
great university. It should not be
buried in books and paperwork.”

Jerome Siuda, a professor at the
School of Pharmacy's Department
of Medicinal Chemistry, also noted
the limited faculty input into the
planning process. He suggested that
the planning process itself be bette
planned. -

Siuda said that one reason he had
welcomed the planning was the rat-
ing given to the School of Pharmacy
prior to the issuance of the planning
document. The National Accredita-
tion Committee rated thesehool
among the top four in the country
and gave it another seven years’
accreditation.

“One big mistake," Siuda

- charged, “was to attack the school’s

quality. The effect of such public

criticism was overwhelming.” He

said that statements made about the

University and City Ministries to be razed

to make room for modern office complex

By Karen Frost
The Pitt News

The University and City Min-
istries building on the corner of
Belleﬁeld and Fifth avenues will
be demolished this summer to
make room for a modern eight-
story office structure.

When the new structure is
complete, the ministry will con-
tinue its service, operating from
three ﬂoors of the new building.

The National Development
Corporation of Pittsburgh will
own the new building, which will
be named Belleﬁeld Towers. The
bell tower will remain as a monu-
ment to the old church.

“Financially, the church can't
afford to stay in this building,"
Dr. King, a minister at UCM,
said. “The building is in need ofa
lot of repairs. To repair the roof
would cost $100,000, and the
heating bills during the winter
months were $5,000.

“The Pittsburgh Presbytery

- cular section of the building and

was interested in saving the
church as an historical land-
mark. Unfortunately, no one is
willing to invest the money that's
needed."

The estimated cost of the new
structure is $6.5 million. Water,
electrical and sewage facilities
will be increased, and ceilings
will be raised to nine feet, instead
of the standard eight feet and six
inches. With these accomoda-
tions, NADCO hopes to attract
computer-oriented and medical
and research ﬁrms.

The church will occupy the cir-

the sanctuary will be on the street
level. Classrooms and offices will
be located on the first and second
floors, and a kitchen and dining
area will be located in the
basement.

Dr. King is excited about the
plans for the new church. “This
has never been done in Pitts-
burgh before,” she said. “We’ve
shown that it can be done.
Maybe other churches can fol-
low our example.“

L.A. study receives Mellon grant

By Jon Williams
The Pitt News

The Andrew Mellon Foundation
has recognized Pitt’s educational
superiority in the field of Latin
American studies by awarding the
program here with a $250,000 grant.
A recent survey by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education ranks Pitt as one
of the top four programs in the
country.

 

The money is in the form of a
challenge grant to Pitt in order to
bring an additional $500,000 to the
program. In return, Pitt’s Latin
American studies department will
receive an annual yield in the form of
interest.

Dr. Carmelo Mesa—Lago, director
of Latin American studies, said,
“The fund will be used to continue
the research we have at Pitt. This
includes our visiting professor pro-
gram, our library and the lecture se-
ries we are presenting.”

involved in Latin American studies
include history, political science and
human fine arts. The program has
centralized its studies on two coun-

tries in particular: Bolivia and Cuba. - .

Pitt maintains one ofthe world’s fin-
est collections of Bolivian work in
art and history. It also is the home of
some of the best contemporary stu-
dies of Cuba.

In the interest of developing their
study of affairs in Latin America,
Pitt has sponsored a visiting profes-
sor each term since 1980. These pro-
fessors hold seminars on Latin

SUCCESS

Music blared and balloons
filled the main ﬂoor of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union yesterday, draw-
ing attention to Health and
Wellness Day, sponsored by
Pitt's Student Health Service.

Two years ago, the event was
just a health fair, according to
Shirley Haberman, coordinator
of the event. This year’s was
bigger and better than ever
before.

“What we did,” Haberman
said, “was to have more interac-
tive exhibits where students
could participate.” Students had
the opportunity to measure their
percentage of body fat, travel the
building confined to a wheel-
chair and ask questions about
topics such as high blood pres-
sure and contraception.

The most popular display was
the “Convincer,” sponsored by
the state police, where students
were given the opportunity to
feel the impact ofa car collision
at l0 miles per hour through sim-
ulation. According to Haber-
man, “Convincer" did exactly
that — many of the students
walked away realizing the impor-
tance of wearing safety belts.

In the ballroom, Pitt’s Dance
Ensemble and Jackie Sorenson’s
Aerobic Workout were featured,
as was Beautiful Hands, a group
demonstrating the use of sign
language.

“The day turned out to bejust
fabulous,” Haberman said. “The
people involved with this project
did a beautiful job."

The Pitt News, Friday, March 29,

Final plan called unreasonable

continued from page one

school's faculty and quality were not
true and can easily be proven false.
The amount of support which conse-
quently surfaced from the students
and politicians was surprising he
said.

Commenting on the overall evalu-
ation process, Siuda said, “All the
criteria seem to disappear except
cost. If you can make a buck or be
self-supporting, you can continue.”

Professor Philip Wion, a member
of the Department of English and
head of United Faculty, said the
planning process as a whole was not
a result of consultation [but rather
was] imposed by the administra-
tion." Wion reiterated the point
made by others that the process
served to divide the faculty and pit
the units against one another.

Wion expressed concern that
tenured faculty might lose theirjobs.
He said that President Posvar had
told him all tenured positions would
be secured in writing but then later
said the faculty “would be given the
opportunity to find other positions
in other departments.”

Professor Joseph W. Eaton,
representative of GSPIA, suggested
that the university administration
and faculty adopt a “dissent chan-
nel” to facilitate open communica-
tion between faculty and
administration. In reference to
"GSPIA, Eaton said that the original
proposal to restructure or eliminate
the school was also based on admi-
nistrative rather than academic
difficulties.

“GSPIA enjoys a national and
international reputation,” Eaton
said. “Most faculty retained promi-
nence despite administrative disin-
terest.” He suggested that the plan to
downsize GSPIA should be frozen
until a permanent dean has been
appointed.

The proposed elimination of the
Economic and Social Development
program, Eaton said, is “a contra-

AT

diction of the criteria on which the
planning was organized.”

“ESD remains the most cost-
efficient unit of GSPIA," he
claimed. “If it be abolished, there
would be a sizable lack of generation
of soft revenue.”

Eaton said ESD ranks quite high
compared to the performance of
other university schools and is sup-
ported by legislators in Harrisburg.
Eaton strongly urged that ESD be
continued as a subunit of GSPIA.

Professor Richard Blackett from
the black studies department was
“pleased to hear of affirmative
action on the planning document.”
Blackett strongly suggested that
mechanisms be thought out so that
those aims come to fruition.

“Each unit,” he charged, “Must
describe in detail the affirmative-
action goals and directives to
achieve those goals.” He pointed out
that the hiring of black junior
faculty has been dropping consis-
tently and that there will soon be a
need for “new blood."

“Excellence and equity are not

dents enrolled in this university are
in the School of Social Work, the

' School of Education and the Black

Studies Program.” These three pro-
grams face either-decreases in fund-
ing or elimination in their present
form.

Patricia Crosson, a professor
from the School of Education, gen-
erally endorsed the recommenda-
tions to restructure the school.
However, we pointed out that the
“faculty aren’t at all happy" about
the 25-percent reduction in its
budget.

“The only way to implement such
budget reduction,” Crosson said, “is
to reduce the size of tenured faculty.

This will weaken rather than
strengthen the quality of the
school.”

Crosson said there was no oppor-
tunity for a formal review of the
School of Education, and that real
faculty involvement is needed in the
planning proces. “It is imperative,"
she maintained, “that faculty have
primary responsibility for the reﬁne-

antithetical concepts,”BIackett said. , mem of academics within the
“Over 50 percent of all black stu- departments."

Play Ball

Spring is in the air. and soon those magic words —
“Play ball!” — will reverberate in Three Rivers Stadium.
But the Pittsburgh Athletic Company is up for sale. The
Pittsburgh Athletic Company is the Pittsburgh Pirate
baseball franchise, more affectionately call the “Bucs.”
The news sent shock waves through the city.

After severval disappointing seasons, both in terms of
attendance and games lost, the Galbreath family decided
they had lost enough money on the baseball team. It
seems that horse racing is a safer investment.

But it was not the fact that the team was for sale that
shocked the city so much, it was the news that the team
could move to another town. Several Sun Belt cities are
actively pursuing the acquisition of a major league base-
ball franchise. '

So, the hype campaign began. Bold headlines in both
Pittsburgh papers suggested the horrifying possibility
that the team would move south. The Pittsburgh Press
ran a series of front-page stories detailing the importance
of the team to the Pittsburgh economy. Mayor Richard
Caligiuri scoffed at the idea, saying the franchise is obli-
gated by the team’s lease with the city stadium authority
to stay in town. I

But those in the know suggested that the lease could be
bought. The almost I00 years of Pittsburgh Pirates base-
ball may come to an end. The team could move to Tampa
and not even change the name. The town already has the
football Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a Tampa Bay Pirates
baseball team would not be so far-fetched an idea.

But the city is rallying to prevent the unthinkable
possibility. Local businessmen have banded together,
announcing their intention to buy the Bucs in order to
keep this vital part of our economy in Pittsburgh.

There was a similar crisis recently in Minneapolis. The
Twins went up for sale after several years of disappoint-
ing attendance. The town rallied, crowds increased and
the team stayed in Minneapolis. If they can do it, so can
we, the Pirate boosters optimistically say.

So the Galbreaths announced that attendance must
exceed one million this year, or the Pirates will be a
memory in Pittsburgh.

Last year’s public relations urged “Let’s go see the
Bucs.” Perhaps this year it should be amended to “Let‘s
go see the Bucs  or else.”

You’re Kidding!

I would like to take this opportu-
nity to respond to the March 13 arti-
cle, “Heyward lost to probation." In
this article, Allan Sodomsky, Hey-
ward’s attorney, believed that Dr.
Conney Kimbo’s ruling was too
harsh.

Too harsh! You've got to. be kid-
ding! Heyward hit someone in the
face, knocked him out and then’
broke the crutch over another per-
son's back, and Sodomsky thinks
that the ruling is too harsh. How
insane!

Anyone, I repeat anyone, who
acts in this manner should be thrown
out of the university, football player
or not. This was not a mere ﬁstfight.
A weapon was used.

As far as the intent issue goes,
Sodomsky said that it was not
shown by the Judicial Board that
Heyward presented intent to hurt
anyone. If he didn’t intend to hurt
anyone, then what does it mean that
he walked into his room‘ got the
crutch and then started swinging it?

Since Heyward swung the crutch
hard enough to knock someone out
and hard enough to break it over
someone else’s back, then it would
appear that he intended to, cause

injury.

Underlying Causes

1 was dumbfounded by the igno-
rance and lack of understanding in
the letter from Miss Burke on the
subject of the Greeks’ fund-raising
activities. Greek Week's major cause
was to raise money for Eye and Ear
Hospital, but there also exists some
underlying causes to Greek Week
that I feel Miss Burke failed to look
at.

Greek Week is a time for all
Greeks to work together for a com-
mon cause, to have a good time and
to show some of their spirit at the
same time. You see, Miss Burke, the
secret to fund raising is to make it
enjoyable enough so that the work-
load behind it seems small. This
includes your so-called “Barf-a-
thon.” I'm sure the Eat-a-thon cost
Roy Rogers money, but have you
ever heard the phrase “It takes
money to raise money”? Besides, I’m
sure the Greeks raised more money
than it cost Roy Rogers, and I'm
also sure that Eye and Ear Hospital
could use the money more than a
truckload of hamburgers.

To answer the question of “What
about a volunteer-a-thon_?" is sim-

require their pledges to do volunteer
work during their pledge period.
Unfortunately, volunteer work
takes time, which many people have
very little of while going to school,
especially when many work if they
wish to continue their education. So
instead, the Greeks set aside one
week in which to raise money for
charity.

Now, Miss Burke, I'm not saying
the Greek system is perfect, and I’ll
never argue that point. But the
Greeks did raise $50,000 for Eye and
Ear Hospital.

What have you done for charity
lately?

The Issue of Taxes

I have been followingthe develop-
ments of the Farrakhan controversy
in the opinion pages of this paper,
but I have yet to find anyone who
has discovered the real issue.

The real issue is not freedom of
speech. Mr. Farrakhan has the right
to say or print anything he wishes.
The problem lies with those student
activities taxes (er, I mean, fees)
which are, as Luke Kluchko states,
university funds. These are not
generic university funds; they are the
$24 paid by each student speciﬁcally
earmarked for the SAF.

Enter the SGB. I think this stands
for Student Government officials,
and they decide how money will be
spent, like government bureaucrats.
Like their U.S. government role
models, who allocate tax money to
opera companies and dulcimer mak-
ers, it's they who allocate SAF
money. Although I enjoy opera and
I even own a dulcimer, I would
rather use my tax money at this time
in my life for other things.

Can I get the SGB to allocate
money to pay a speaker that only I
and two friends want to hear? I
really don’t know whether I could or
not, but if requests outnumbered
funds, then allocations would
become a game based on numbers.
And I don’t fault the SGB. How can
they possibly be fair to everyone
individually?

The answer to that rhetorical
question is — they can't. The student
activities fee should be abolished,
and everyone can save the $24. The
members of the BAS can use their
$24 to hear Farrakhan, and other
groups can get speakers oftheir own
choice.

Self-brainwashing

The quotes attributed to GSPIA’s
actinggdean (March 20) indicate the
extent to which an institutionalized
form of self-brainwashing can lead
to the rewriting of history and can
unintentionally make things in the
future even worse. To analyze only
one such quote: “We can  begin to
do what we think needs to be done in
order to make this a high-quality
school.”

The “quality” of any school or
department is no more and no less
than whatever its reputation makes
it out to be; because there are no
completely accepted standards, any
reputation is open to question.
According to a number of published
rankings, GSPIA had, until last
year, a very high reputation in this
region, in the country and overseas.
This data was available to all of
those involved in the provost’s plan-
ning process.

Why they chose to ignore the evi-
dence, publicly ridicule the school
and, in the process, denigrate the
entire university as well is known
only to them. From the first
announcement that the school!
would be demolished until recently,
nobody involved in the planning
process and no GSPIA administra-
tors have suggested ‘that thescorn
heaped upon the school was a high-
level administrative blunder of con-
siderable magnitude (as were similar
statements about other parts of the
university).

When the acting dean‘ now
declares that the school will beginto
change itself into something of “high
quality," he perpetuates the fiction
that the school’s reputation is mean-
ingless. But reputations have more
to do with attracting students than
anything else. Students considering
graduate study are less concerned
with the future than present quality,
so the acting dean's assertion merely
makes a deteriorating condition
even worse.

The phenomenon of institutional-
ized self-brainwashing is well-
known, although it has many titles
— Orwellian doublespeak is another
version. The rule is, “Because the
leaders can make no errors, all their
statements are truth; if history must
constantly be rewritten, so be it.”
Those so brainwashed cannot cor-
rectly be accused of making inten-
tional misstatements, for they
usually believe what they say. They
deserve our sympathy, not our
support.

The Pitt News, Friday, March 29, 1985

Parting Shots/ Bryan Lee

The ﬁnal recommendations are in
regarding the administration's Five-
year Plan, and I can remain silent no
longer. Ever since the preliminary
recommendations were announced
last fall, the Pitt News opinions
pages have been glutted with letters
and editorials decrying the Five-year
Plan, the administration and, no-
ticeably, Dr. Benjamin and Dr. Pos-
var.

Letters have proliferated from
angry GSPIA and School of Educa-
tion students. The argument has
been put forth that the administra-
tion has. lost the signiﬁcance of
higher learning and (shudder) is try-
ing to run the university like a
business.

Let's be grown-ups here. Does
anyone out there really think these
people are horned monsters out to
gut the very meaning of the word
education?

The argument is one of idealism
vs. practicality, the lofty ideals of
education vs. no-nonsense dollars
and cents. What these Chicken Lit-
tles don’t stop to think about is that
if the university doesn’t stay solvent,
there won't be any university at all,
let alone a GSPIA or School of
Education. '

The administration is simply com-
ing to grips with a looming crisis in

education. Every year, there are
fewer and fewer potential college
students. The baby boom is over.
Grade schools and secondary
schools all over the country are clos-
ing because there are simply not as
many students. In two or three
years, that phenomenon will be

affecting the institutions of higher-

learning. Fewer students mean less
tuition money. The schools within
the university will have to be self-
supporting.

And it’s not just a matter of tui-
tion money. Every year since Pitt
became state-related, the percentage
of Pitt‘s expenses covered by money
received from the state has declined.
Massive tuition increases have
reflected this fact.

The situation doesn‘t get any
brighter when the federal role is con-
sidered. The new limits in aid to col-
lege students are just the beginning.
The Reagan administration's view
on guns-and-butter issues is all too
clear.

The university administration is
simply coming to grips with this fact
by emphasizing the sciences,
because that is where the federal
money is.

Cuts in the School of Education
are unfortunate, but they simply
reflect the reality of our society. No

‘ A Lone Voice in the Wilderness

one is going to become a teacher
when starting salaries are so ridicu-
lously low. There is no need to invest
in a school that few will attend.

As to USPIA, even the founding
dean of the school intimates that
GSPIA does not enjoy the high
repute it once had. When Donald
Stone left the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs in
the early 1970s, it benefited from
more than a million dollars external
income in grants and subsidies. Last
year GSPIA had an income of only
around $45,000. A school held in
high regard will generate its own
income.

The administration should be
commended for the foresight it has
shown with the Five-year Plan. Pitt
is one of the few schools in the coun-
try trying to anticipate the inevitable
fiscal crisis that will soon confront
all schools of higher learning all
across the country.

Those wishing to complain about
the situation would do better to
voice their opinions to the state and
federal governments, for in reality, it
is their policies toward education
that are forcing the hand of Pitt‘
administration. A

and Chicago University. Pitt’s pro-
gram is peculiar in that it is the only
one which presides in an area with-
out a significant Latin American

Mesa-Lago said: “President
Litchﬁeld had great interest in
regional studies. Dr. Cole Blaiser, a
political science professor, was able
to convince Litchﬁeld to develop a
Latin American program here at
Pitt.”

Mesa-Lago added that President

“You cannot have studies all over

pass 10

by Bryan I. Fischer

NEW YORK — "We're not like
David Bowie or Hall and Oates,”
explains Scott Kempner, guitarist,
singer and chief songwriter of New
York City's Del-Lords. "They know
what they're doing through the end
of '86 —- which film project, which
record they'll be working on. We're
sort of thinking on our feet.”

If the past six months are any

\ indication, Kempner and his band-

mates - guitarist Eric Ambel, bass
player Manny Caito and drummer
Frank Funaro — might do well to
continue their standup routine.
Since the November release of the
band's debut lp, Frontier Days, the
Del-Lords have laid the ground-
work for what may yet be a
considerable following. A positive‘
reaction from the likes of Rolling
Stone, Musician, The Village Voice and
even- Time magazine certainly hasn't

A ‘done anything to hurt the band's

chances of achieving a sizable lis-
tening audience.

  

Dave H00ker/ The Piiit News

l_ ‘.33
Guitarist, singer and chief songwri-
ter of the Del-Lords, Scott Kempner

 

Seated in the sparsely populated
barroom of New York City's Irving
Plaza nightclub, Kempner fits in
easily with the crackling pool balls
and droning television that blares
the news from its perch behind the
bar. Born 31 years ago in nearby
Bronx, Kempner is affable in con-
versation -— a task made easier, no
doubt, by the band's current brush
with success. Dressed down in
sweat pants, a Ring magazine

' sweatshirt and a bandana, only a
- prominent Stratoca ster tattoo on

his left arm offers any indication
that Kempner is a veteran of rock
'n’ roll’s survival-of-the-fittest
wars.

"I went from being a teenager off
the street into a band and had a
record deal before I had ever played
in front of an audience," Kempner
explains, recalling his original tour
of duty with the Dictators. A
seminal punk outfit that emerged
from New York more than a decade
ago, the Dictators paved the way
for hardcore and furnished
Kempner with his first battle scars.
"I was 18 when the thing started,
25 when it ended, and yet I was
still 18 when it was all over. I had a
lot of catching up to do.” _

After completing a rap sheet that
read four years, three albums (a
posthumous live cassette la ter sur-
faced) and two record companies,

The Del-Lords look back to create

was three years before anything
akin to what would eventually
become the Del-Lords came about,
allowing time for Kempner to
"recover.”

''I used to try to write songs all
the time. Every night I'd be up until
the sun came up, trying to write
something I could live with," he
remembers. "When the Dictators
broke up, I realized I was really out
there on my own." I

Left to his own devices,
Kempner's persistence helped pave
the way along his comeback trail. I
Working with a local band, Helen's
Wheels, he started to gain the
confidence he needed to start put-
ting together a new band. Having
played a negligible role in the
Dictators’ musical shenanigans -
which were dominated by songwriter
Andy Schernoff — he" faced the
transition of becoming a singer and
songwriter in addition to his accus-
tomed role of playing rhythm gui-
tar. To this end, not only was
Helen the first person to start
liking songs Kempner was writing,
but working with her in the "studio
provided a creative revelation.

"Helping audition musicians for
Helen's band gave me the confi-
dence that even though I might not
be as good a guitar player techni-
cally as a lot of guys, I knew if I got
them onstage, I was gonna send
them home crying."

Any tears shed at a Del-Lords
show are sure to be drowned by
dancing, jumping about and an
abundance of the key ingredient to
a festive rock 'n’ roll atmosphere:
movement. Counted among the
many bands tagged with the vacu-
mis label of "New American
Music," a list of the Del-Lords’
influences range far and wide but
never stray from the birthplace of
rock 'n’ roll. Theirs is a sound
unmistakably born in the U.S.A.,
which Kempner considers more of
a privilege than a predicament.

an interview if he had heard the

that seem to draw on Creedence
[Clearwater Revival] as an influ-

ence, and he said, ‘Well, you know,

maybe those people had the same
Bo Diddley records I had when I
was growing up.’ And that is exactly
the case."

Calling to mind everyone from
Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash to
the Band and CCR, one name that
frequently punctuates Kempner's
conversation is Bruce Springsteen.
The two first met in 1975, and the
encounter still evokes a certain
amount of awe from Kempner,
who maintains the somewhat dis-
tant friendship. Springsteen did a
guest spot on the Dictators’ last
record, Bloodbrothers, a favor
Kempner repays with a revved-up
version of Springsteen's "Johnny
99" as part of the Del-Lords’ live
show.

the future

Influences aside, the Del-Lords
are anything but imitators.
Although most of the familiar com-
ponents of the band's sound date
back more than 20 years, they still
manage to meld it all together into
a driving, uncluttered sound that
makes for an encouraging contrast
to the generally complacent music
of 1985. Best of all, the Del-Lords
accomplish their clean sound with
no stylistic string.s attached.

"We don't break guitars, and we
don't come on stage wearing girls’
clothes," Kempner says, acknowl-
edging that the band's blue jeans
and workshirts don't offer much
hope for fashion-conscious retail-
ers. ''It makes it a lot harder
because people lilce that stuff, but I
think bands like ourselves, Los

'Lobos and the Blasters, for
instance, have something deeper --
and more lasting."

Neil Simon

by Bryan I. Fischer

Last year, Daryl Palmer hit only 17
home runs, but this season he is
already well on his way to breaking
Roger Maris’ all-time record of 61.
Playing his home games in Fulton
County Stadium’s famed ”Launching
Pad" has certainly aided Palmer's
chase, but it's another pursuit that
has made the difference. Her name is
Debbie.

Debbie is a rock ’n’ roll singer who
transfixes Palmer at the Limelight, a
glitzy high-tech nightclub in Atlanta.
Temporarily stalled in his pursuit of
Debbie, Palmer's persistence eventu-
ally pays big dividends in both rom-
ance and round-trippers, which begin
to rocket off the young Atlanta
Braves outfielder’s bat.

The Sluggers Wife is a bittersweet
love story that draws on the purely
American inventions of baseball and
rock ’n' roll to create an often hilar-
iously funny film that offers an
exceptional return to form for Neil
Simon. The theme of a mismatched
couple —— a favorite of Simon's — pro-
vides the backdrop for The Sluggers
Wife, with Simon updating the
dilemma and giving it a breadth of
emotion unseen in such past efforts
as The Odd Couple or Seems Like Old
Times.

Michael O'Keefe shows remarka-
ble agility as Daryl Palmer, a gifted
ballplayer whose competitive spirit
occasionally boils over into brutality
in his efforts to save his marriage.
Rebecca DeMornay's portrayal of
Debbie Palmer requires less emo-

The action moves right from the

‘Forever Man’ lopes toward longevity

BEHIND THE SUN
Eric Clapton
Warner Bros.

Eric Clapton had the same
dilemma as Mick, Pete Towns-
hend and Paul McCartney. Hav-
ing attained a comet-like
eminence in the rock arena early
on, he could either plummet
with the weight of the/‘rock ’n’

.roll lifestyle," kamikaze fashion,
or switch gears to adopt a more

restrained existence and make a
furtive attempt at longevity.
Two things can happen with
this choice. You can diversify,
get smart and mature with
refinement (Mick and Pete), or
you can become a slow-motion
parody of yourself, a treacly-
sweet ”stylist” in the worst
sense of the word. Such is the
case with Mr. McCartney.
Clapton has done a little of
both, if his new record is an indi-
cation. At its worst (”See What
Love Can Do" or ”It All
Depends”), Behind the Sun mimics
the easy rock of Dave Mason.
Gently Caribbean, with congas
and island girls singing backup,
it's never threatening, never
arresting.iAt its best (”Tang1ed
in Love" and "Something's Hap-
pening”), the raspy voice and

fluid guitar style are grafted
onto crisp polyrhythms, proba-

bly influenced by the record's

principal producer, Phil Collins.

Two songs, a straight blues
vehicle (”Same Old Blues”) and
an r&b classic (”Knock on
Wood”), are stripped of their
urgency by production errors.
Why replace horn charts with a
synthesizer? Why the chorus of
female backup voices? The
arrangements call attention to
themselves and make the tunes
puffy and impotent.

On the good side, the single,
produced by ex-Doobies pro-
ducer ‘Ted Templeman, churn;
along just fine and has the req-
uisite angry guitar solo.
”Tangled in Love” uses synth to
good effect, adding a buzzing
jumpiness to the "Layla"-style
voicing. Again a memorable gui-
tar solo. ”]ust Like a Prisoner”
has drummers Phil Collins and
Jamie Oldaker in each channel

of your stereo, playing off of

each other remarkably.

When this record doesn't
work, it still smokes agreeably.
But like rotten wood, it's too
sweet and won't crackle when
put on the fire. When it's good,
it generates a little heat and
plenty of fire. Well-seasoned
wood does that.

  ERIC CLAPTON‘

FIRST RECORD
The Offs
CD Presents

With a healthy mixture of
soul and punk, the Offs’ First
Record resembles, the later work
of The Clash sans socio-political
pretensions. Lead vocalist Don

Vinil's raspy Strummer-esque A

delivery establishes the punkier
core of the album, and the addi-
tion of playfully crude saxo-
phone’ and trumpet provides a
'60s soul backdrop.

The opening track, ”You Fas-
cinate Me,” rolls with a Tijuana
Brass feel, adding a bit of spirit

to Vinil's hoarse crooning.
Much of the album sounds like
the work of a slightly neander-
thal party band, guys who
learned to play their respective
instruments while still in high
school and discovered at one
point that making their own
music was a lot more] funthan
reinterpreting Irving Berlin.
These arrangements, how-
ever, show off the band's musi-
cal skill. ”Why Boy," the
wrap-up track to side one, pre-
sents more of the omnipresent
brass but this time with a feel
more akin to the easiness of the
Style Council. The lighter tunes

on the album are effectively bal-
anced by the blaring horns and
raunchy guitar of "True Story”
and the screaming ”One More
Shot," which employs even
more of Billy Hawk's ragged
‘guitar work.

Basically, this album is a lot of
fun but little else. So for those
of you who are looking for mind
expansion or insights, steer
clear. But if you are in a pleasant
mood and ready to chuck the
day's hassles, the Offs could do
you well. And you won't even
have to shave your head or wear
leather to fit in with these guys.

ALIVE AND DEAD IN INDIANA
by Michael Martone
Alfred A. Knopf

”I>know what you're thinking. You
think that if you slice through a life
anywhere, you'll find the marbling
that veins the whole cake. Not true,"
writes Michael Martone in his first
book of short stories. Alive and Dead in
Indiana presents eight thin, but far
from meager, slices of life all linked
together by theme, treatment and
locale.

Martone fictionalizes historical
people who have led visible public
lives, inviting his readers to take part
in some very private encounters.
Among those explored are Alfred
Kinsey, Ezra Pound, Colonel Sanders
and Iames Dean, all of whom have

I had some connection (however

slight) with ‘the state of Indiana.
”People are always going through
Indiana,” writes Martone.

The author doesn't attempt to
account for public lives by creating

private ones, yet there do seem to be
those "marblings” or hints of historic
fact drizzled through the fiction.
Without trying to explain away the
facts, Martone simply and subtly
intensifies the unknown and perhaps
the mystery about what famous and
infamous people are really like.

Martone’s constructions of reality
employ varying forms of narrative
convention, though all eight stories
are written in the first-person point
of view.

Other stories are told by a detached
narrator, but one who has had some
particular attachment, whether casu-
al or formal, with the famed. The
author's strategies provide a sensi-
tive contrast between the ordinary
and extraordinary, between past and
present and between fact and fiction.

Though fiction about real people
may have become an exhausted
trend, Martone’s tales are refreshing
and even enthralling,‘ considering
their extremely short length.

CONVERSATIONS WITH AMERI-
CAN WRITERS
by Charles ‘Ruas
Alfred A. Knopf

Piecing together a book of inter-
views with noted writers is a mon-
strous undertaking not only from the
standpoint of the time involved but
more so from the standpoint of scope.
Too often, such projects are
approached by people with, either
limited knowledge or insight or min-
imal compassion when dealing with
the complex and often eccentric
minds of their subjects.

What Charles Ruas has accom-

plished with this book is a cohesive"

set of portraits that not only paint a
believable picture of the writer as an
artist but, more importantly, depict
the writer as a human being.

Each interview is supplied with a
brief introduction that sets the tone,
time and place for each, offering a
setting for the familiar and concise
bits of background for the unini-
tiated. Through the atmospheric de-
scriptions, we come to appreciate

STUDENT APARTMENTS — Immediate vacan-

 

..,..,..,........, .,....... .,.

divergent personalities — the laconic
nature of Capote, the cerebral quali-
ties and existential inquisitiveness of
Norman Mailer, the lively good
humor of Paul Theroux, the trials

_ and tribulations of the writing life for

Scott Spencer and the soul-searching
of Toni Morrison.

The book, though sensitive to the
writers’ need to explain, is by no
means simply an unchallenged forum
for their opinions and perspectives.
Ruas, an astute scholar in his own

right, pursues lines of questioning‘

-that serve to press the authors on
touchy issues and inconsistencies in
their writing and rationale. With the

‘exception of the detailed discussion '

of the Norman Mailerllack Abbott
fiasco, the majority of the informa-
tion is fresh and thought-provoking.
For aspiring writers and avid readers
alike, Conversations With American Writ-
ers is an informative and interesting
guide book, an eloquent depiction of
those people whose thoughts and
words continue to evaluate and

. define our time.

Upward nobility

by Michael Selz

An eccentric British nobleman titil-
lates himself by hanging in his under-
wear from a noose (with a chair
underneath him for safety purposes)
and accidentally kicks the chair away.
Exit the 13th Earl of Gurney. Enter
his son and heir, lack, a paranoid
schizophrenic who prefers to be
called ].C. — short for Jesus Christ.

Peter Barnes’ satire, The Ruling

Class, is currently being performed by -

the University of Pittsburgh Main-
stage. A complex and nimble comedy
on one level, it is also a dark indict-
ment of English (or more generally,
human) society. The richness and
variety of characters and the theatri-
cality of the play make it an ambitious
undertaking for any college theater

, department.

The story line is enticing enough.

After the 13th earl dies, his brother -

Sir Charles (Richard Ewing) has a
plan for begetting a new generation
of Gurneys. He has his own mistress
seduce the lunatic Jack (Steven
Brown) so that she can marry him
and bear a son, and then the family
can have Iack re-committed. Stand-
ing in the way of this scheme is the
German psychoanalyst (Michael
Herd), who is trying to curetlack, and
the loyal Tucker (Mark P. Steven-
son), the family servant.

The first act goes slowly, probably
because until you know the motiva-
tions of the characters, their broad
self-parodies aren't very entertain-
ing. They're just silly. '

Sir Charles is so stiff and pompous
in‘ his movements and delivery (”The
strength of the English people is in
their inhibitions," he says later in the
play, referring, I guess, to himself)
that he becomes irritating. His wife
Claire (Hazel Carr Leroy) similarly is
such an exaggeration of the de-sexed
Englishwoman that her love scenes
(and there are several — none with
her husband) are completely implau-
sible. Sir Charles’ brother-in-law,
Bishop Lampton (David Tabish),
looks perfect for the part but recites
his lines like they're just that —— lines.
The same can be said of the psycho-

’ analyst. He has a clipped rational tone

probably intended to be a German
accent that he never relinquishes
even though his character calls for a
great deal of emotional range. His
patient calls him ”a Teutonic midget"
near the play's end. He's not too far

off base. It's not clear whether these .
problems were the result of bad cast— ‘

ing or bad direction.

The play's savior is Jack, a long-
haired, bearded messiah in a white
three-piece suit and sandals. He has a
manic, kinetic quality that is always
engaging. His brand of Christianity is

:;ry—]o Kelly and Steven Bown star
in The Ruling Class.

all fun, noguilt, no fear — just love.
He says things like ”I put on my
glasses because I am cold” and
lounges on the cross for relaxation.
He is a walking ad campaign for God,
warning people, ”Pléase remember,
you are talking with the big one,” re-
ferring to himself also as ”the holy
roller." . ’

Brown makes remarkable use of
his body in this role, particularly his
hands. With his fits, his evangelizing
and his devastating metamorphosis
into a murderous ”blend of God-

given condescension and arrogance,"

 

the character is very physically
demanding. This role is Brown's
M.F.A. thesis, and he is riveting.

Also excellent was Mary-Jo Kelly
as Grace Shelley, the bawdy mistress
of Sir Charles turned devoted wife of
Jack. Her transformation from an
opportunistic tart to righteous Lady
Grace was believable, as was her
unexpected love for her lunatic hus-
band. Her wedding night stripteasel
monologue, performed not for her
husband but for the audience, was
incredible. A list of good performan-
ces must also include the role of
Charles’ son Dinsdale (James Bond),
an obsequious invertebrate whose
loyalties flutter with the wind, and
his antithesis, the loyal dog of a ser-
vant Tucker, whose comedic pres-
ence was sorely needed.

Probably the play's best-staged
scene was when the doctor brought
the Electric Christ (another person
who believed himself to be God) to
meet Jack, hoping to shock him out of
his delusion by confronting him with
another with the same affliction. The
stage was one grand trinity —— the
crucifix looming at the back center
with two caryatid bedposts on either
side forming a triad of verticals, two
Gods running around below and the
shrink playing emcee with his tape
machine and microphone. And then
the eight-foot beast (the Id?)
appeared. This scene succeeded.

The play itself and the acting of
some of its characters make The Ruling
Class worth seeing. It is a powerful
and complex drama disguised as a
comedy.

Pitt sets stage for-gymnastic regionals show

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The NCAA Northeast Regional
Women's Gymnastics Champion-
ships will be held here tomorrow
evening at 7 p.m. inthe Fitzgerald
Field House. Participating teams
will include Penn State (182.97 sea-
son average), Ohio State (182.76),
New Hampshire (178.15), Pitt
(177.02), Bowling Green (176.02),
and Rhode Island (175.12). A win
for No. 4 Pitt would mean a guaran-
teed spot at the nationals, which will
be held on April 12-13 at the Univer-
sity of Utah.

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team has been concentrating this
week on perfecting their routines
after some especially tough work-
outs the week before.

“Last week, we went super-hard
and did lots of sets and repetitions,”
explained sophomore Alisa Spector.
“This week, we’re resting up a lot so
we can be relaxed for Saturday. The
competition will be tough, but so
will we." Spector placed second on
the floor exercises and third in the
all-around last year at regionals.

The gymnasts, who hold most of
their practices and home meets at
Trees Hall, have spent some of this
week’s practices familiarizing them-
selves with the conditions at Fitzger-
ald Field House.

“We’re working out at the field
house to get used to the atmos-
phere,” stated Jackie Calderone.
“We’re just trying to go through
exactly what we’re going to do for
the meet. Penn State and Ohio State
are really tough, but I can’t say it’s
impossible for us to beat them. If we
hit our routines, we should have a
good chance. We should give them a
run for their money.”

Women’s coach Donna Sanft is
cautiously optimistic about the pos-
sibility of winning the competition.

“Penn State and Ohio State are
definitely the favorites to win -
Penn Stateis ranked sixth in the
country,” said Sanft. “I think we’re

Beth Waters

all set to have a very good meet. We
had an excellent meet in the field
house ‘when we met the Japanese,
and I think the girls are in the same
frame of mind now.” ‘

Although the team is just one step
away from nationals, they are focus-
ing all of their attention on perform-
ing well as a unit tomorrow.

Kristy Pieters

“As a team, our best shot to make
nationals is to hit regionals,”
explained Sanft. “Our season aver-
age score isn’t high enough to help us
out much. It’s a long shot but not
impossible.” V

The gymnasts will also have the
opportunity to individually place
this -weekend for a position at
nationals; but according to Sanft,
their main concern is‘to win as a
team: “I don’t think any of the girls
are going into the meet thinking they
want to get a good all-around score
just so they can make nationals. I
think they're going in thinking they
want to hit their best routines to help
the team.” '

Last year, the regionals were held
at Penn State with the Lady Lions
coming out on top with 184 points
over Pitt’s 181.90. This year, the
Lady Panthers hope to gain an edge
with the home team advantage.

“As long as we do ourjob we’ll be
fine,” said Spector. ‘‘If a lot of peo-
ple come out and support us, it will
help a lot."

“Penn State and 0hio\State are really tough,
but I can ’t say it’s impossible for us to beat
them. We should give them a run for their

money-”

Kingdom links Davis
to Kennedy’s dismissal

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Elbert Kennedy was all set.
Meeting last September with the
women's athletic director, he
learned of the apparently new
emphasis to be assigned to the
Lady Panther cross country and
track team.

Ever since the NCAA’s

,national convention in January

1984, schools wishing to attain
Division 1 status have to meet

_ new guidelines beginning Sept. 1,

1986. Previously, schools only
had to sponsor eight male varsity
teams. That is amended by eight
female varsity teams having to be
spawned by 1988 and six by
1986.

The Pitt athletic administra-
tion was ready to have six teams
by September 1985. With basket-
ball, swimming, tennis, gymnas-
tics and volleyball already in
Division I, cross country/track
was pegged the newcomer.

Knowing that, Kennedy, who
is enteringhis fourth year as the
coach of the women’s team, rec-
ruited so heavily that he esti-
mated that he could have signed
14 high school standouts by
June.

He’1l never know. Last Thurs-
day, meeting with women’s
athletic director Carol Sprague
and associate athletic director
Dean Billick, Kennedy was fired.

His dismissal marks the second

women’s team vacancy within
the week. (Basketball coach Judy
Saurer resigned for personal
reasons.)

The details surrounding
Kennedy’s departure remain
clouded. He admits that he is
frustrated and is unsure whether
he is to blame. A longtime friend

and disciple, track star Roger’

Kingdom, disclosed that athletic
department officials have
wanted to oust Kennedy ever
since internationally renowned
Clinton Davis decided to attend
Pitt but not compete for the
Panthers. Women’s athletic
director Carol Sprague com-
mented that the firing was “in the

best interests of the program,”

refusing to elaborate.
“I never asked to resign,”
Kennedy said yesterday.

‘‘I would get people to run
cross country,'and it wasn’t a
priority,” Kennedy said. “When
women entered the NCAA
[I982], they wanted me to take
track money and share it with
cross country. But I didn’t want
to take from track because it was
our bread and butter. Then
recently we were going to build

up the program. 1 probably”
would have had 20 people
combined.”

For Kennedy, founder of the
prestigious New Image Track
Club in Pittsburgh, that’s all he
wanted: the funds and support to
back a winning cause. Now he
contemplates legal action against
a department he believes unduly
relieved him of what was a part-
time position.

The odds, Kennedy said, were

against him. He said he began .

with 10 track members in Sep-
tember but only had four (Sue
Torre, Amy DiFrancesco, Dana
Roberts and Lisa Williams) last

- week. A variety of injuries, nota-

bly a broken foot to star Renee
Henderson, and dropouts reﬂect
the lacking depth.

' Kennedy’s biggest recruitment
would have been Peabody High
School’s Tania Stevens, consi-
dered one of the top sprinters in
the country. Now she is one of
several whom Kennedy is help-
ing even further.

‘‘I’m in the process of helping
get [probable Pitt recruits] ‘into
other schools,” Kennedy said.
“I'm not saying, ‘don't come
here,’ but the men’s program has
taken over right now.”

The team is under the direc-
tion of Coach John Vasvary and
will continue to be until Sprague
meets with Athletic Director Ed

Bozik and Billick next week to”

find a replacement. That may not
be necessary, though, as Sprague
admitted that Pitt might followa
nationwide trend of combining
men’s and women's track
programs.

Kennedy, meantime, contends
that he never put his 12-year-old
track club ahead of Pitt interests.
“It's not in my interests to over-
shadow Pitt,” Kennedy said.
“New Image, when it came to
time and effort, took second
place. In other people’s eyes,
maybe it was this way — too
much success breeds contempt.
I’m not saying that’s the case
here, but there has been a nega-
tive reaction in the past.”

Furtherriiore, Kingdom
asserted there were other reasons
behind Kennedy’s dismissal.
“They said that he was following
me to track meets,. bypassing
obligations to the team to coach
me at these meets,” Kingdom
said. He included the Vitalis
Olympic Invitational at Brendan
Byrne Arena and the Athletic
Congress meet, both in Febru-
ary, as well as New York’s Mil-
rose Games in January.

Kennedy is unsure of his next
move — “I don’t think 1 need to
see Carol [Sprague]; I'm not try-
ing to talk my way back in” —

admitting that “there are a lot of
things 1 can say later that 1 can’t
say now."

The Pitt News, Friday, March 29, 1985

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

At the start of this year’s men‘s
tennis season, head coach George
Dieffenbach commented that pro-
ducing better than a .500 record at
the end of the year would make him
“the happiest coach at the University
of Pittsburgh."

As the season approaches the
halfway mark, Dieffenbach’s goal
may very well be within reach as the
squad currently boasts a 6-5 record.
To some, such a mark would indi-
cate nothing more than mediocrity.
However, in considering the caliber
of the schools Pitt has faced this
year, the 6-5 mark is outstanding.

The facts:

0 The Panthers’ opening road trip
to Tennessee in early March resulted
in a 3-2 record to begin the season.
To many schools, such a stint would
indeed be tiresome. Nonetheless, the
Pitt men produced.

Midseason
Update

0 Many of Pitt’s opponents carry
heavy loads of highly recruited for-
eign players. The majority of the
Panther squad is composed of in-
state players.

0 Most of the strongest teams Pitt
has faced placed heavy emphasis on
their tennis programs, with many of
their players receiving scholarships.
Squads such as Tennessee Chatta-
nooga, Middle Tennessee, Blooms-
burg and Penn State are just a few
names that fit into this category.

Considering this information,
Dieffenbach’s squad is by no means
a mediocre team.

Mid-season highlights:
0 March l0 at Middle Tennessee:

man Greg Campbell and sophomore

,,;,, ,j,,,;'1 Tennis team oaly ‘OK’

Rich Monteleone produced a mild
upset against the Blue Raiders’ tal-
ented No. 3 duo.

0 The Panthers have managed
their share of shutouts during the
season’s opening nalf with impres-
sive 9-O victories over Maryville Col-
lege, Tennessee Tech, Tennessee
State and Lycoming. Other wins
include matches against West Lib-
erty State (7-2) and Robert Morris
(6-3).

0 The men’s victory against the
Robert Morris Colonials was a key
upset for the Panthers this past
Tuesday, as this match pushed Pitt
above the .500 mark.

“The Robert Morris win was a
very important one for us,” said

,Dieffenbach. “There is no question

that they have a very strong team as
most ‘ of their players are on
scholarships."

In terms of building confidence,
the Robert Morris match may have
marked a turnaround for freshman
Greg Campbell. Campbell began his
first collegiate season strong but has
hit a mild slump since the March 16
match against Bucknell.

Since then, Campbell has accum-
ulated a 2-4 record in singles, a mark
he feels could have been better.

“I've been in slumps before, but I
always managed to break out of
them,” Campbell said after the
Robert Morris match. “This one,
though, has been an ongoing process
because whatever it is I’ve been
doing wrong has been hard to
pinpoint.

“In the Robert Morris match, I
lost the first set but still kept my
head and won the next two,” he
added. “The thing that upsets me the
most is my single matches against
Bucknell and West Liberty because I
probably should have won both of
them.”

One key addition to the men’s ten-
nis program was the transfer of
sophomore Jeff Dadowski to the

— squad this season. Dadowski played

for Bloomsburg during his freshman
year and has compiled a 7-4 record
at Pitt since assuming the No. 2 sin-
gles position. Dadowski faced his
old school on March 18, when the
Panthers traveled to Bloomsburg
University. He lost a tough match to
Mike Casari, finally yielding in three
sets 6-7, 6-0, 6-1.

“The Bloomsburg match was
good because I had a lot of fun.
Mike is such a strong player that I
really had nothing to lose,” he said.
“In looking at the season as a whole,
I would have to say that my doubles
play with Dave Johnson has picked
up since the beginning.”

The Panthers’ next team match
will be held today at 3 p.m. on the
Trees tennis courts. The men’s squad
will then face St. Francis in an away
match on Saturday. Pitt should win
both matches fairly easily.

One of Pitt's strongest tests will be
Sunday’s home match with Slippery
Rock, another highly talented squad
on the Panthers’ tough schedule.

“The Slippery Rock match should I

decide whether or not we have a win-
ning season,” Dieffenbach stated.
“We’re really going to be up for Sun-
day because we lost to them last sea-
son in a tough 6-3 match.”

One bonus for the Pitt team
would be increased attendance at
their home contests. Thus far,
attendance at the men‘s home
matches has been minimal. How-

"ever, as in any sport, faithful fan

support can often be the deciding
factor in serving as the margin
between victory and defeat.

The Pitt News, Friday, March 29, l985

Final Four Preview
The long road to Lexington ends this weekend

Memphis State is led by All-
America Keith Lee and point guard
Andre Turner. Lee averaged over 20
ppg during the regular season and
carried the Tigers through the Metro
conference into the tournament.
Since the tournament began, how-
ever, the Tigers have shown that
they are more than a one-man team.
William Bedford‘s play throughout
the tournament when Lee got in foul
trouble, along with Turner's shoot-
ing, which featured jumpers that
beat UAB and Boston College at the
buzzer, provide the proof. Judging
from the trouble that Georgia Tech
gave Georgetown with their big
front line, Memphis State, with 7-0
Bedford and 6-H Lee, may be the
only team that can stay with the
Hoyas. ‘

Villanova is the Cinderella team of
the tournament. After their destruc-
tion at the hands of none other than
Pitt (85-62) on March 2, the Wild-
cats have turned a then grim Rollie
Massimino into now jolly Rollie.
The Wildcats have knocked off Big
10 champion Michigan and ACC
power Maryland on their way to the
Final Four. Villanova boasts an
impressive front line in Ed Pinck-
ney, Harold Pressley and Dwayne
“D-Train” McClain. They can jump
with the best of them. The backcourt
of Gary McLain and Dwight Wilbur
is quiet, but they get the job done.
Perhaps the only glaring weakness is
the lack of a deep bench. If Pinckney
gets in foul trouble, Villanova could
be in trouble.

ODU
heads
women's
tourney

The final four teams in the
NCAA Division I women's bas-
ketball playoffs will take the
next-to—the-last step to claim the
national title in Austin, Tex.,
tonight. Old Dominion (29-3)
takes on Northeast Louisiana
(30-1) at 7 p.m., while Georgia
(28-4) battles Western Kentucky
(28-5) at 9:30 p.m.

ODU won the Eastern
Regional by‘ defeating Ohio
State 72-68 on March 23. In the
Midwest Regional held March
24 in Monroe, La., Northeast
Louisiana knocked off Louisi-
ana Tech 85-76. Georgia reached
the Final Four by defeating Long
Beach State 97-82 March 23 in
Los Angeles in the Western
Regional, and Western Ken-
tucky won the Mideast Regional
over Mississippi State 72-68
March 24.

Nancy Lieberman, who led
Old Dominion to the national
championships in l979 and l980,
explained the pressures involved
in competing in the Final Four in
a story for yesterday’s USA
Today. “Pressure is the hype, the
crowds, the competition, fans
and media. How coaches and
players handle it determines who
wins the game,” said Lieberman,
who played on the 1976 and I980
U.S. Olympic women’s basket-
ball teams and who now plays for
the Dallas Diamonds of the
Women‘s Basketball League.

“My advice to the teams and
players is try to block out most of
the hype and distractions. Don’t
spread yourself too thin off the
court, and play for you and your
teammates, not necessarily for
the crowds or media,” Lieber-
man said.

“Remember: This is where you
wanted to be the day all those
coaches came recruiting you in
high school."

Georgetown was everyone‘s choice
for pre-season No. 1. After perhaps
not playing their best ball early in
the season, the Hoyas have come on
of late. The Hoyas suffered back-to-
back defeats to St. John's and Syra-

cuse during the first half of the

season but then came back to blow
out both teams twice. All-America
Patrick Ewing has combined with
the quiet support of David Wingate,
Michael Jackson, Reggie Williams
and Bill Martin to create an awe-
some starting ﬁve. Team them with
the deep Hoya bench, and you have
a virtually unbeatable combination.
The only weakness the Hoyas have is
their foul shooting, around 60 per-
cent as a team, but even that looked
good in their victory over Georgia
Tech. The Hoyas may be
unbeatable.

St. John's has the privilege of being
able to say that they defeated
Georgetown, but they were also
defeated twice by the Hoyas. The
Redmen are led by All-America
Chris Mullin, who can simply do it
all. Mullin has scored 20, 21 and 25
points in the three games against
Georgetown this season, but he will
not be the key for a St. John's vic-
tory. lf the Redmen are going to beat
Georgetown, they must get some
kind of play out of Walter Berry and
Bill Wennington. Berry and Wen-
nington must at least stay with the
Hoyas on the boards if St. John's is
even going to have a prayer. Mullin
will get his points, but he must be
complimented by Berry and Wen-
nington for St. John's to win.

Panthers

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The wind and rain that stopped to
pay a visit at Trees Field did not
dampen the enthusiasm of the Pitt
baseball team on Wednesday.
Thanks to a shower of home runs,
the Panthers defeated St. Vincent
20-7, improving their record to 3-3.

“Everybody hit well,” said Coach
Bobby Lewis. “We are swinging the
bat well and scoring a lot of runs."

Senior Paul Westwood led the
Panther attack going four for four
with two home runs, a double and a
single and five RBIs. Junior Ed
Nowicki went three for five with two
home runs and two RBIs, including
the game-winner. Senior Tom
Horew went two for four with a
grand slam, while Snuffy Everett
also added a home run.

“It was a good team perform-
ance,” Horew said. “Georgetown
and the other Big East teams are
going to be a lot tougher, though.
That's when we are going to see what

The Pitt News, Friday, March 29, 1985

‘n b’
we are made of.”

The home run hitters were not the
only ones who were hot. Senior Ed
Bodnar went three for three with one
RBI, and Joe Murray, another
senior, went two for three with two
RBIs. Freshman Dave Westwood
was two for four with a double and
one RBI.

The Panther pitching was also
good. Freshman Rich Gavran got
the win, making his record I-I on the
season. Gavran gave up three runs
on six hits with seven strikeouts.
Relief pitching was provided by
Mike Shannon, who gave up three
runs (only one earned) on two hits.
Freshman Rich Lowman pitched a
perfect inning, retiring three straight
batters, and Mark Wasielewski gave
up one hit and one run in one inning
pitched.

“The game helped us a lot,” Lewis
said. “We got out in front early, and
that gave us a chance to put in subs. I
was pleased with the way Gregg
Lamanti plafyed, getting three assists
in one inning. Also it was good get-
ting a chance to see Rich Lowman
pitch. We are going to be using him a
lot more as the season progresses.
