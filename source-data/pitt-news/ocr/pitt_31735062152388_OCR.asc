Dean Clothier
Regrets Frat
“Ethics Code”
Dean Of Men Urges

Greeks To Report
Rule Violations

 

A discussion of Dean Robert C.
Clothier’s letter to members of In-
terfraternity Council concerning a
so-called “code of ethics” prevent-
ing fraternity men from reporting
infractions of rushing rules, a re-
port by Carl H. Voss on the work
of the fraternity committee, Robert
Kleeb’s social chairinan’s report, and
the presentation of the horseshoe
tournament cup to Sigma Pi consti-
tuted the business of a short In-
terfraternity Council dinner meeting
held last Tuesday evening at the
Theta Chi house.

The recent violations of rushing
rules which were reported to the
Fraternity Committee and immedi-
ately dealt with, caused several
members of Council to complain to
Robert C. Clothier, dean of men,
that a “Code of Ethics” among fra-
ternity men on the campus pre-
vented them from reporting all
cases of infractions. In response to
this excuse, Dean Clothier wrote a
letter to members of Council
through Ferd Arens, Bus. Ad. '31,
expressing his keen regret that such
a situation should exist.

Clothier’s Letter

Dean Clothier said in part, “No
plan of fraternity control will prove
eﬂective unless it is supported in
spirit as well as in letter by the fra-
ternities themselves and by their
members. The existing plan on the
Pitt campus is no exception to this.
If the fraternities and the individual
fraternity members are genuinely
intolerant of infractions of the
rules, and believe that proven in-
fractions should be penalized, if
each fraternity member is willing to
assume his own personal responsi-

,bility to refrain from breaking the

rules and to report apparent infrac-
tions by others-—if these things are
true, then there is no reason ',why
the existing lan for the control of
, , A  on our campus
should ii “”func"tion ‘effectively . 

“If one man fails to report an
infraction by another through fear
of recrimination, he is governed by
an impulse of guilt on his own part,
or ‘of cowardice, which it is rea-
sonable to assume does not exist on
our campus. V

“If he fails to report an infrac-
tion because of a “Code of Ethics,”
he_ obviously has failed to grasp a
mature sense of values.” The mem-
bers of council seemed quite back-
ward‘ in voicing their sentiments.
Only three opinions were given,gand
these pointed to the truthfulness of
the situation, that such a “Code of
Ethics” has for swine time and does
at the present time exist.

In his report of the fraternity
co.inmittee’s work, Carl Hermann
Voss, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, stated
that the work has been fairly han-
died and is encouraging. In his opin-
ion, the undergraduate. members of
the committee were heartily in ac-
cord with this committee's work and
sanctioned all its decisions, with re-
gard to violations of Council rules’
and routine fraternity matters.

Ball Tickets

Robert Kleeb, Phi Kappa, ap-
pealed to the various fraternity rep-
resentatives to open an active
campaign ‘to sell tickets for the In-
terfraternity Ball. The’ dance for
which Paul Specht and" His Record-
ing Orchestra have been engaged
wil be held at the Hotel Schenley
Ballroom Friday, January 16. The
admission is $5.50, and attractive
favors are promised.

The cup of the Horseshoe Tourna-
ment was presented by Arthur Nei-
dig, Dent. ’31, Lambda Chi Alpha,
to representatives of Sigma Pi.
The results of the bowling tourna-

ment now in progress were with-.

held, pending the results of the con-
solation tourneys.

sandstone is used for the base
course because it is not so porous
as limestone, and is, therefore, more
resistant to water. Limestone is
being delivered to the Cathedral for
facing the ﬁrst three floors of the
building at the rate of about 3 car-
load of the ﬁnished stone per day.
Most of the stone is of a particular
delicacy and beauty of carving, as
it will be easily seen from the

Sigma, Xi Club
Gets Charter

National Group Installs New
Chapter on Campus

One of the ﬁrst ranking honorary
fraternities of the United States
will take its place on the Pitt
campus when Sigma Xi, national
honorary’ scientiﬁc fraternity, for-
mally installs a chapter here on
February 11.

At the same time that recognition
was given the Sigma Xi Club. of the
University of Pittsburgh, the peti-
tioning body who automatically be-
come the charter members of the
new chapter, a similar grant was

made to Harvard,University. These ‘
two universities were the only ones .

considered by the national organiza-
tion at its convention in Cleveland,
during December.

Installation exercises will be con- '

ducted under the supervision of G.
W. Stewart, Professor of Physics. at
Iowa State University, national
president of Sigma Xi, and Edward
Ellery, professor of chemistry and
Dean of the Faculty at Union Col-
lege, national secretary.

Installation

The installation exercises will be '

followed by an organization meet-
ing of the new chapter members,

probably be held. The lecture will
deal with some ﬁeld of scientiﬁc
interest.

Members are elected to Sigma Xi
on the basis of their achievements
in scientiﬁc research. Those who
are thus eligible are the faculty
members and the graduate of sci-
entiﬁc departments of the Univer-
sity. Associate memberships are
also open to those undergraduates
who have shown some capacity for
scientiﬁc achievement.

Club Programs

The Sigma Xi Club of the Univer-
sity has been sponsoring lecture
programs and generally promoting
interest in science and scientiﬁc de-

0 velopment for several years on the

campus. The group is made up of
Sigma Xi members who were elected
to chapters in other schools, and
who, since coming to Pitt, have been
interested in having their group re:
ceive the sanction of the fraternity
in the form of official recognition
forchapter installation. ‘

Dr. Davenport Hooker, professor
of anatomy in the School of Medi-
cine, is president of the Sigma Xi
Club, Dr. Robert T. Hance, profes-
sor and head of the department of
Zoology, is secretary, and Dr. 0. E.
Jennings, professor and head of the
department of Botany, is treasurer.
, Elections will probably be made
early in the year, at which time a
number of faculty members and
graduates of the various scientiﬁc
departments will become active
members of Sigma Xi.

Cathedral Christmas
Lighting Commended»

In the Christmas Lighting con-
test sponsored by the Civic Club of
Allegheny county, the brilliant
white star which sparkled so bright-
ly on the top of the Cathedral dur-
ing Christmas week was awarded a
certiﬁcate of honorable mention. Es-
pecially did the idea of the white
star on the eak of‘ the high build-
ing receive he commendation of
the club. It is the intention of the
University to place the star on the
Cathedral every Christmas from
now on.

The star was composed of an
aluminum framework set with white
glass panels and illuminated with
electric lights.

troit, December 27-31. More than
700- delegates from schools in all
parts of the country attended the
conference.

Delegates from Pitt were, Dr. S.
B. Linhart, secretary of the Univer-
paity; J. G. Quick, registrar; Miss
Isabelle Anderson, assistant to the
fdean of women; Robert C. Clothier,

senting Student Council.

Problems arisin from the entire
aspect of University life were dis-
cussed during the conference which
was fostered by the National Stu-
dent Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.
organizations.

Reach Conclusions
. Among the conclusions reached
during the conference were:

(1) Greater progress is made In
undergraduate organizations. by
a minority group using force and
coercion than by a discussion
group.

(2) The present fraternity sys-
atem ha: disadvantages in that it
“makes for false exclualveness, ad-
ditional expense and forces men
to enter extra-curricular activi-
tied.

(3) The fraternity system may
be beneﬁcial by reason of its per-
sonal effect on the members.

(4) College, students exhibit
more interest In “extra” activities
than the regular curriculum.

(5)..'l‘lie desire for prestige is

'the greatest nIotl1'at«|ng».1or~ce«tot..
students entering extra-currlcu-
lat activities.

(8) ‘Students do not want to
discipline themselves, especially
when it come: to passing on net:
that demand expulsion.

(7) The present system of
grades-marking-Itandlngs vitally
affect: the practice of cheating.

(8) Military tralnlng In schools
is largely a part of a program
calculated to keep the public in
llne and get it used to the mili-
tary idea of obeying orders. .

(9) Students should be educated
to the evils of race-discrlmina-
tlon.

(10) A new faith will spring up
from the conflict between science
nnd religion, having its inception
among undergraduates.

. The conference w s addressed by
a number of leadin‘ educators and
students of world problems includ-
ing Norman Thomas, Sherwood
Eddy, Hon. J. Stitt Wilson and
Reinhold Neibuhr. I

The Detroit conference marked a
signiﬁcant project, nation-wide, for
the ﬁrst time, in creating co-opera-
tion between student and collegiate
administrators and in Working‘ Out
plausible relations of religious ac-
tivities on the campus.

Faculty Club
Moves Jan. 14

Will‘ Start To Raze Old
Building In February

Next Wednesday, January 14, will
be the last day the Faculty Club
will be housed in its present quar-
ters, the old Porter homestead. Ar-
rangements have been made for its
continuance in two club rooms in
the basement of the Schenley Hotel.

Two weeks will pass before the
actual work of tearing down the
building will begin, according to Dr.
Goldberger, president of the Facul-
ty Club. The University has re-
served this time for the removal of
the valuable hand-carved oak pan-
els and anything else it may want.
The carvings will be put aside un-
til they can be used in the Cathe-
dral of Learning.

Both Faculty Club members and
students regret the necessity of
tearing down the old red mansion——
the scene for many years of nu-
merous social functions. Here meet-
ings, smokers and dances have been
held at a very reasonable cost. Now
the erection of the new Presbyteri-
an Hospital necessitates moving to
temporary quarters in the Schenley
Hotel until the Cathedral of Learn-
ing is ready to house the club.

The new quarters in the Schen-,
ley Hotel offer an attractive environ-
ment. There is both an interior
and exterior entrance to the club
rooms. The. hotel accommodations
willbe available to the members at
all times. .

The recommendations of the com-
mittee on the future of the Faculty
Club to accept the proposition of-
fered by the hotel management were

For Fraternity

One week from tonight, Paul
Specht, _international bandmaster,
raises his baton, his eleven musi-
cians pause momentarily, and as his
baton descends, Sally Rogers, Col.
'34, and Robert Kleeb, Col. ’31, start
down the ballroom of the Hotel
Schenley, leading the grand march
of the Interfraternity Ball.

This orchestra leader has to his.

credit an enviable record of musical
performance. He ﬁrst gained na-
tional prominence when he startled
the musical world with a syncopa-
tion of the works of the old masters.
His success was instantaneous and
since that time, he has had under
his supervision at onetime as many
as forty-two orchestras, scattered
throughout the world. In addition,
he has played before European roy-
alty on many of his eighteen trans-
Atlantic trips.

Decorations
With the aid of a huge silver ball,
which will diffuse multi-colored

lights throughout the ballroom, a
decorative effect will be achieved,
promising to set a standard for fu-
ture University affairs.

9 To complete the elaborate appear-
ance of the ballroom, colored leath-
er streamers will be suspended in
festoons from the chandeliers and
from the ceiling. -

The committee has already select-
ed the favors for the frolic and has
granted the contract to the .L. G.

study of the 1928 freshman class
with the purpose of getting a com-
prehensive view of the student's in-
tellectual achievement after two
year; of college work.

More than 700 Sophomores of the
University took the examination

_ and the tests were given to 4,390

groups such as are sponsored by the
Y. M. C. A. and by Council.

Called upon by John Bowman,
Col. '32, Teitelbaum explained the
purposes of the club. It is to pro-
vide “information and discussions
on important contemporary prob-
lems in economics, politics, and so-
cial studies which interest students,
and which cannot be completely sup-
plied by any other agency on the
campus. Its intentions are wholly
serious as it is designed to help stu-
dents educate themselves.” He fur-
ther stated that the constitution

ovided for a committee of three

ulty membcrs to advise and cell-
sor the actions of the club.

‘ Organize Soon

After a short recess, due to the
variance of opinions of Council
members, a motion was passed which
authorized the student relations
committee to accept the petition of
the club. After the decision Teitel-
baum announced that the group
would hold an organization meeting
in the near future.

The remainder of the student re-.
lations report which “recommended
that it be given permission to con-
sult with Mr. Rome and some of the
members of the Freshman Class re-

time and the unusual character

' of this dance, they also request that

they have the power to appoint the
chairman, and in other details, to
be responsible,” was accepted im-
mediately. ;

Shortly after this report Council
granted the request of the co it-
tee to appoint the chairman and to
be responsible. After conferring
- Mr. Rome, graduate manager

of student activities, Seidle ex-

. pressed the belief that the Student

Re-lations_ would appoint a number

Step On The Grass? “No,”

Say’ Bug Catchers, “Not
Wken’n0ﬂicer’sNear!’3

“Zoologists are not Botanists” it
has been said time and time again
and if youshould stop around and
ask the burley guardian of law
and order who sees that the grass
on that little plot at the entrance
to Schenley Park is not trod be-
neath the feet of the lowly zoo-
logiits, Ile’ll conﬁrm this rather
controversial statement.

The interest which Pitt students
have in Zoology, despite opinions
otherwise, has made the officers
job at that point a huge one. The
Zoology students so hate botany
and anything botanical that they
tramp all over the grass com-
pletely disregarding the sign silt-
ing them to stay oil‘.

Furthermore the Zoologists, as
zoologists go, are wise. Wise by

rtue of experience When a cer-
tain burly entleman with a Blue
uniform an aAJack Hoxie pistol

‘standing near by the gentlemen
scientists (and gentlewomen too)
are the perfect law-abiding citi-
lens. They’d rather walk a mile
, than step on the beautiful green-
grsss, they say. But watch them
some morning when His Majesty
overslept or was called away and
neither law, order not botanical
respect can stop them.

Want Speakers

Fishkin announced that he was
attempting to secure Will Durant,
noted philosopher, and Norman
Thomas, socialistic nominee for
president, to speak to the students
during the coming semester.

John Reeder, Dent. ’31, announced
that the investigations commit-
tee had made it possible for any
organization‘ to secure rooms in
Alumni or State Halls by applying
to the oifice of the registrar. He
also stated the University Bookstore
was being conducted upon the most
economical and efficient plan pos-
sible. . -

Following the suggestion of
Enamuel Fishkin, Council adopted
the plan of appointing a committee
which will interview all students
who present petitions for the chair-
manship of the senior invitations
committee. Their ﬁndings will be
reported to Student Council before
ﬁnal action is taken by that group.
This change in the appointment of
chairmen to major University,func-
tions, came as the Aresult of student
discussion.

No More Rules

Council formally abolished all
eshman regulations for the incom-
in- fresh of Eebruary, since the
handling of such regulations had
iailed.

attention that gambling was current
in the Activities building, they
-passed a rule which abolished all
card playing in that building, and
designated the Men's Floor Com-
mittee to enforce that action.

cording to C1-powder, a double ballot,
or “change of opinion” vote may} be
taken by the club audience. his
method provides for two ballots
from which the majority decision is
taken.

Following this, the debaters will
return to the campus, arrivin in
time to present their third de te
of the day, the main feature of a
forum on unemployment insurance
scheduled to be held in the Heinz
House at 3:30. Robert C. Clothier,
Dean of Men, has been named as
chairman in charge of the forum
program. This program will im-
me ately follow the debate be-
tween the two university teams.
Members of the teams will remain
to answer or refute the questions
and arguments of -the students at-
tending the forum.

Tireless Students

At 8:00 _p. m., the tireless stu-
dents of argumentation will present
their fourth and final debate at the
East Liberty Y. M. C. A., on Whit-
ﬁeld street, bringing to a close the
most exhaustive day of forensic
competition in the history of both
Western Reserve University and
our own Men’s Debating Associa-
tion. Arrangements may be made
to provide for a single judge to re-
view the arguments of both teams,
probably some one recognized as an
expert on unemployment problems
and their control.

Parrish Talks

Professor_ William M. Parrish,
men's debating coach and head of
the Public Speaking department,
does not favor the old practice of
collegiate debate juding whereby

three or more ‘udges name the
winning team. his usually makes
the decision seem mor important

to the audience than t e informa-
tion revealed by the discussion.
Professor Parrish favors either an
audience decision or none at all.
And this is the interpretation of in-
tercollegiate debatlng that is be-
_coming more and" more popular
among college debating societies,
states Professor Parrish. ,

The present function of debating,
as debating is ‘encouraged at the
University b the coaching stall‘, is
not to prov do the means for the
establishment of an impressive rec-
ord of contests won and lost, but is
or two more important ‘things.
First, to give students practice and‘
training in speaking. before large
public audiences of every class. And
second, to give the general public
the latest authentic information on
current problems, thus creating in-
terest in questions of national im-
portance that they may eventually
be called upon to decide for them-
selves by vote at the polls.

Style For Gridders

The stalwart football players
are not so stalwart when cold
weather comes. Those huskies
who played non-collegiate football
in the ranks of the physical educa-
tion classes have taken to the ﬁeld
of battle now that Pitt's Blue and
Gold gridders have left the laurels
of the ﬁeld to lesser players.

Far be it from us to lower the
courage and the inttepidity of our
stalwart pig-skinner: (not literal,
please) but why should football
players wear gloves on the
chalked ﬁeld? For Io--in the pur-

suance of our duties today we saw
ﬁfteen of Pltt’s many sons play-
ing the old game of Rutgers, Yale
and other small colleges with
gloves. Of all things.

Upon questioning Mr. Miller of
the physical education department
it was disclosed that the boys re-
fused to go down on the field with-
out gloves. They would go with-
out headgear and without football
jogs. Their little runningtrunks
would suﬂlcc. But take away their
gloves lmdjnnry a one would ven-
ture down. *

We are in no position to know
whether or not the wearing of
gloves seems to add anything’ to
the possibilities of better playing
--or better passing but it would
seem that such is .§_he case. It
might start a new fall for the foot-
ball boys and should we see Notre
‘Dame parading on the ﬁeld with
white calf-skin gloves next we’d
expect the army to come out in
Gold stripes and shoulder epon-
lettes. Anyhow--that's what the
best dressed football men will
wear.

Of E_n_gineers

Claims - W e I din g Replaces
Riveting For Building

Members of the Inquiry Club
were given an insight into “the un-
employment situation in Pittsburgh”
by James Mill of the “Helping
Hand,” when he spoke on the cam-
pus Wednesday.

The “Helping Hand” is a chari-
table organization maintained for the
beneﬁt of the unemployed, of whom
more than 5,000 are registered there.
Food, clothing and lodging are given
to the jobless, while an effort is
made to secure jobs for the men.
Thousands of dollars worth of food,
clothing and equipment have been
donated by industrial corporations
and business men.

Most of the unemployed taken
care of by the organization are not
skilled workers but common labor-
ers who are mainly past 40 years
of age. “It is these men who con-
stitute the greatest problem, ac-
cording to Mr. Mills, for not only
have they been replaced by labor-
saving devices, but because of their
age, they can not secure work in
corporations who hire no workers
past 35. “The big problem _of the
‘Helping Hand’ is to take care of
the man who has been used up by
industry and who is of no further
use to them. There is no place for
this man, despite the fact that at 40
he is probably at his best."

Of the unemployed taken care of
by the “Helping Hand,". approxi-
mately 54 per cent are white, 38 per
cent colored, 65 per cent citizens,
and 82 per cent non-married.

Mr. Mills was the ﬁrst speaker on
the economic situation of a series of
four being held by the Inquiry Cl_ub.
Future speakers include Mr. Thild-
er of the Housing Bureau; Dr. F.
D. Tyson of the Sociology Depart-
ment, and Dr. Ralph H. Watkins of
the Economic Research Bureau.

Then came the yawn. and when it
was over so were the Christmas hol-
idays, with nothing left for us to re-
member but a little tragi-comedy of
three acts, that we saw. The name
of the play was _
Age” and the theme song was “Hit-
tin’ the Bottle.” All the characters
were drawn from dancing fools be-
tween the ages of sixteen and sixty.
Act One took place in a hot spot of
the night known as Coﬂee Dan's and
lasted for about ﬁve hours.’ A short
intermission, while the audience and
actors grabbed some sleep. Then
Act Two, in the Hotel William Penn
at the Intercollegiate Ball. A long
sleep after this scene and then the
ﬁnale, A New Year’s Eve, 1930-1931.
The ﬁnale was kind of blurred be-
cause of the smoke in Pittsburgh or
something. The players_had fallen
asleep on their feet by this time and
by the time they woke up it was
Monday, January 5,_ and another
day at school.

.___°___

Speaking of Christmas, E. A.
Batchelder, Asst. Registrar, other-
wise Endicott, gave Hermine Ruoff a
doozy of a compact-—you know, that
“something to remember me by."
. . .xAnd Gertrude Doitch arrives in
our midst with the squirrel coat
which isn’t her sister's after all, and-
a new black and white hat, which is
the nertz, as Cart Grocott would
have it. Also Gertie is wearing a
nice black dress with insets of close-
clipped fur at the neck. All in all,
we think it's a ood et-up. And
gives everyone ese a ‘tide old in-
feriority complex. . . . Marty Fallon
shows his beaming countenance
around, but the countenance is
slightly marred by some superﬁcial
wounds about the forehead and chin.
Marty ran into a door.

_.0_.

Another rumor—that the Commit-
tee for the Junior Prom is consid-
ering havin Austin Wylie to make
our music t at to-be-lived-for night
of February 20. We advise that
after you put the ﬁve simoleons in
the sock-for the Inter-frat, you bet-
ter salt away about ten more and
get ready for another great day,
cause Austin Wylie is no set-up. And
maybe a supper, too, If the money
comes in fast enough. See what you
can do. . . . Adelaide Hunter dances
every year at the Intercollegiate
Ball. We might say that this dance
is really a feat and requires a lot of

stamina, for the audience is the least’

appreciative in the world.

....Q.._.

The Delts are needin money
these days, we see, for t ey have
decided to part with their radio, al-
most a brand new one. In plainer
words, the Delts are having a raffle,
and the radio goes to the bird who
punches the lucky number. This
doesn't mean that the Delts must
part with the radio, necessarily, but
then, we're sorry to put crooked
ideas into a racket thats sure to be
on the up and up. ’

Boy, oh boy, talk about the spiﬂy

spent the holidays in the West In-
dies, and comes back with a ‘beauti-

in January? And whatever is the
matter with the boy, he swears that
he read 400 pages of a textbook

And so that's almost all, except
we must come through with a Girl
of the Week. Pretty smooth and
bright as all the rest of the school
put together, and about the only girl
around here who has no enemies.
Flo Luman. Her old stamping
grounds are the Owl oﬂlce and
vicinit , and 0u’d be glad to be
aroun here I everyone was like
Flo. She's, looking particularly at-
tractive since the B. F. from Texas
took an aeroplane and came up to
visit Flo for Christmas. Now if
there were about a hundred Flor-
ence's we wouldn’t always have a
hard time ﬁguring out this girl of
the week problem.

I wish I had remembered to make
some resolutions. Now I have to

Bob McChesney made New Year
resolutions. . . . Bob was in Detroit
for a while that with the Y. M. C. A.
Conventioners . . . and Gene Pry was
in San Antonio, Texas, for the Phi
Gam Convention. . . . Are there any
more conventions in the audience?
Bill Beck was in St. Petcrsbur ,
Florida, and while he was there-Its
family had to use Bill's middle name,
which happens to be Freer (2) be-
cause every Pelican in Florida, and
there were plenty in St. Petcrsburg,

College Humor chose for its ‘sport

Fails Of Goal

University Contributions Are
Given To Charities

 

Although the Welfare Drive
sponsored by the W. 8. G. A., Stu-
dent Relations Committee, Yuletide
Festival Committee and M. S. G.
A. met a generous response from the
Universlt , the amount of goods and
money co acted failed to reach that
desired, according to Hermine Ru-
on’, Phys. Ed. '31, a member of the
committee for the drive.

Lsckcd Publicity

Miss Ruoif stated that had the
students been better informed as to
the intention of the workers, no
doubt there would have been more
material donated for the _.poor fam-
ilies of Pittsburgh. Since Friday
was the only day in which the stu-
dents could bring bulk ds, those
who forgot their contri utions had
no further opportunity to donate to
the cause.

The total amount in cash collect-
ed was $12, while three cases of
canned goods and a number’ of sep-
arate gifts equaling about an addi-
tional case were the bulk 'fts. The
drive began Thursday nig t at the
Yuletide Festival where Santa
Claus received donations -of money
during the Grand.‘March.

The donations of food, clothing
and money have already been given
to worthy charity organizations of
this city.

’S a terrible “raquet" tryin to think up something new to 

each week—so we'll just say “hel o”

and save the rest of our energy to

tell you about all our bargains, et eetera (we learned how to spell that
over the holidays). Well, let’sr ﬂic‘l<er: .

CLAIRE TIMLIN

A GIRL friend of mine the other
day asked me where in Pittsburgh
she could get good chile con carne-—
can you guess where I sent her?
Yes, you wi-.n—-the University store,
of course. Their chile is homemade
you know, and it certainly tastes
good these cold evenings. The Uni-
versity store serves regular evening
meals, too, priced at 50, 65 and 85
cents, at any time from ﬁve to eight
o'clock.

C *

I'VE HEARD a lot about poise--
but it seems to me nothing can give
you more of it than a little bank
account, put aside against the ro-
verbial “rainy day." The Oakand
-branch of the Peoglaes Pittsburgh
Trust Company, For s and Meyran
avenues, will be glad to talk to you
about starting an account there. It
wouldn’t be a bad idea, you know,
to save a little of all that money
you got for Christmas.

I V I

WITH the dawn of a new semes-
ter just around the corner, it is
time to think about your next se-
m-ester’s textbooks. Meese’s Book
Store, 3811 Fifth avenue has a com-
plete line of both new and used text
books at very reasonable prices.

I 1 I

FOR STATIONERY—-the very
latest thing--notebooks, and other
school supplies, as well as artists’
materials and drawing instruments,
try C. M. Stauft, 3806 Foiibes street.

0 l I

DO YOU have a gorgeous. ring
that belonged to your great-great
aunt or somebody, and which you
can't wear because the setting is out
of date? Well, your worries are
over—-Rockey and Volmrich, jewel-
ers and diamond setters, 505 Clark
building, will set it in a beautiful
modern setting for you. And you
can depend upon them, too, for they
do much of the engraving for the
University’s organizations.

WELL, I discovered something
new—-—I dropped in at the. Werme
School of Music, 220 Stanwix street
(across from the Jenkins arcade,
in case you aren't acquainted with
this town), on last Sunday after-
noon-—they have their orchestra
practice there Sunday afternoons,
you know—-and I was fortunate
enough to hear “Society's Synco-
pators,” the orchestra which is to
play at the Peabody High School
dance at the Hotel Sch-en-ley on Jan-
uary 22. I thought I was getting
too old for high school dances but
I think I'll crash this one, because
no matter what else, they certainly
will have a good orchestra. And the
nice part about it is that you can
be just as good as the boys in the
orchestra by taking the Werme
course in music. I could rave on all
day about their teaching, but I want
to keep you in some suspense, so
more about this next week. Just
this, though——if you are looking for
a good orchestra for some of your
rushing affairs, just drop in to the
studio and give their orchestra the
once over.

iii Sense Of Values

 N A "CAREFULLY PHRASED, logical and

  _ helpful letter addressed this week to Inter-
J 1  f_rate1'nity Council, Robert C. Clothier, dean of
5  A3.-~1"1AleIl, says that no plan of fraternity control
  prove effective unless it is supported in
I spirit as well as in letter by the fraternities
  and their members. He further points out that
1 _ ishouldwfraternities hesitate to bring to Inter-
, , , fraternity Council or the Fraternity Commit-
‘ ,3 ggtee of the University evidence of infraction of
r ‘ rules, Pitt's plan of fraternity control can not
1 :3 ‘succeed.
.  ‘With, this reasoning in mind, the action of
 " the group which shortly before the Christmas
1-  gvacation charged two other fraternities with
G * 1:5 ifviolation of rushing rules will
2  all fraternity men and observers alike.
"*7-Should’ fraternities refrain from reporting ap-
 parent infractions by other fraternity men,
Ajji = partly from fear of recrimination or because of
:-’:a,. so-called “code of ethics” which prevents one
;_,man _ from reporting another, "the purpose. of
  regulations becomes lost.
.  Dean jClothier emphasizes this point by ask-
sfing if [fratemity men have grasped a mature
 sense,Aof*,;values. He says, “All of us value loyal-
f 1. ty as a;pr_.ime essential of friendship. However,
,  we deméind that a man to whom we grant our
loyalty; shall be worthy of it. And certainly we
 are loyal to our University and fraternity
 rathergthan to some one who is willing to in-

J. H. Smith, associate-professor
of Civil Engineering, was one of
twenty engineering professors from
eastern universities to attend a. con-
ference on welding in New York
from December 29- to December 31.
The conference was sponsored by
two branches of the .American So-
Clety of Welding, the National Re-
search Council and the American
Bureau of Welding, to get together
some of the instructors from the

to bring to them through lectures
and trips to modern—equipped con-
cerns_1-ecent progress made in gas,
electric and thermic welding.

Professor Smith upon his return
to the university says he was con-
siderably surprised by the rapid
progress of welding recently. Be-
sides saving money for steel com-
panies by replacing the rivetin of
heavy machinery I to cast 1I'0Il
frames, it is eliminating much of
the noise made in the erection of
large steel construction work. Some
engineers Aalready advocate‘ its re-
placing riveting in bridges. One
New Yorker has paid eight dollars
more for each ton of steel needed
in the construction of his building to
have the joints welded instead of
riveted, thus _eliminating most of the
noise otherwise produced.

At the General Electric Company
in Schenectady, New York, welding
has reduced the cost of the produc-
tion of the General Electric refrig-
erator considerably.

The steamshovel is the noblest
work of man. Its strong steel arm
conquers all things and clears the
way for man's progress toward that
unknown esoteric destiny toward
which he has advanced since the
Stone Age. How I thrill when I see
its mighty jaws chew a huge bite
out of Mother Earth! In strength it
seems to rival the giants of old.
Its sinews are stronger than the
muscles of the toughest football
player. They are made of bright
steel. Never tired, the steamshovel
keeps on working when puny men

By WALTER B. JONES, PII.D.,
Research Professor of Education

We asked 656 of the present jun-
iors to answer the questions: (1) Do
the new-type examinations appeal to
you as being more or less desirable
than the usual ten-question essay-
type examination? (2) What, In

  Hungerford

F a c i l e Fingers, Monologue
Earn Rousing Applause

 

 

When “Cy” Hungerford, cartoon-
ist of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
spoke to sophomore women at their
get—together Wednesday, January
7, he responded to his introduction
by turning to his easel and swiftly

drawing the cartoon of a smoothly-
pated gentleman (representing him-
self) bowing, then bowed himself, to
show his appreciation of the ap-
plause. .

“I suppose I should begin by an-
swering the question asked cartoon-
ists most often about their wor ,”
he said, “that is, ‘Where do the ideas
come from?’ I couldn't ﬁgure out
the answer myself, so I asked the
person who should know most about
it--that is, Mrs. Hu_ngerford——and
she told me-—” To illustrate Mrs.
Hungerford’s answer, he drew a
precocious-looking _child about one
year old, clothed in 9. single gar-
ment which was attached to its
wearer by a huge pin-1nc1d_ental_ly
the nearest thing to a fraternity pm,
he added, that a cartoonist ever
wears. The child had a_. small stub
of a pencil clasped in his hand, and
was kneeling on the floor drawing
the picture of an object called “b1-
sickle” by its creator. “I’m told
Henry Ford began the same way—
but I suppose that's where I made
my mistake.”

Then he drew what we thought
was a. paint brush, but a few more
strokes and presto! there stood a
Scotchm-an. “I suppose I've gotten
a few places by being‘ a cartoonist,
anyway. I went abroad a few years
ago, and while in the mounta1n_s_m
the northern part of the British
Isles, saw quite a. few _Scotchmen.
You know, these (pointing to the
paint brush) are real}y pocket-
books.”

A few more strokes of the crayon
and the well-known ﬁgure of the
jovial colonial gentleman known as
“Pa” Pitt was on the board.‘ “The
rotundity of this old fellow is due,
probably, to apples rather than to
prosperity,” he remarked.

After Mr. Hungerford had ﬁn-
ished, there was a scramble for the
cartoons he had drawn, and of
course, quite a few requests for au-
tographs. He had been afraid that
the applause at the beginning of
his speech was premature, but the
applause after he had ﬁnished was
louder still! _

dent of the sophomore class, pre-

Johnson Present At
Sociological Meet

During the Christmas recess Pro-
fessor Roswell Johnson, head of the
Oil and Gas school, attended the
meetings of the American Sociolog-
ical Society in Cleveland, Ohio.

Dr. Johnson has been invited to

 

contribute an article on positive

eugenics in the race betterment
number of the “Survey Gra.phic.”

On January 5 he spoke on the
subject “New Russia” to the Men's
club of the First Presbyterian
Church. _

He spoke on “Student Life in the
Soviet Union” Friday night, January
2, to the Civic Club Scholastic of
Awards at their second meeting in
the club rooms located in the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel.

Professors Sherrill and Layton

ieraged ﬁfteen pages in length, with

the exception of the general culture
tests which contained 42 pages and
a professional education test of 36
pages. The members of this class
were therefore well fitted to have an
opinion on the subject. In addition
they had, at least in part, partici-
pated in three other testing pro-
grams of the Pennsylvania Study.

Type of Test Preferred

The type of test preferred by the
junior class as a whole was the new
type test. A preference for this type
of test was expressed by 65 per cent
of the 656 students, while 28 per
cent preferred the essay-type test,
and 7 per cent expressed no opinion.
A number expressed a desire to have
both types of questions included in
the examination.

When the results were classiﬁed
by schools of the University, it was
found that the new type test was
preferred by 61 per cent from the
College, 68 per cent from Education,
71 per cent from Engineering and
Mines and 73 per cent from Busi-
ness Administration. This seems to
indicate that while the majority of
students from all schools preferred
the new type tests, proportionately
fewer students from the college
preferred this type of test than from
the other schools of the University,
while the largest percentage of pref-
erence was found in the School of
Business Administration.
Preference by A, B, C, D, and F

Students

The replies were next classiﬁed on
the basis of grades made by the
student in the combined test._ Re-
gardless of the quality of their test
performance, as indicated by the
letter grades, more than 50 per cent
of all grade groups expressed a
preference for the objective tests.
Omitting the 7 per cent who state
no preference, the _percentage of
each grade group indicating a pref-
erence for the new type test is as
follows: 79 per cent A's, 74 per cent
C's, 68 per cent B's, 65 per cent D's,
and 56 per cent F’s.

Advantages and Disadvantages of
The New Tests

The answers which the juniors
gave to the question concerning the
advantages and disadvantages of the

new type tests were interesting.
The three advantages listed most
often were: (1) The newtype tests
are more comprehensive; that is,
they jgrovide a. wider sampling of the
ﬁeld eing tested and “therefore, in
their judgment, are fairer. Students
are not conﬁned to a few questions
on a limited part of the field of
knowledge; the questions cover the
ground more thoroughly, thus giv-
ing more variety. (2) They believe
the new tests to be more economical
as to time required to take thetests
and to mark them, as well as the
amount of writing required. (3 The
next feature emphasized was t e ob-
jectivity of the test, in which the
students recognized impartiality -in
grading They also stated that these
tests are more concise, clear, speciﬁc,
and exact, qualities which make for
objectivity.

Among the other advantages men-
tioned by members of the group W9-S
that the new tests evaluated a stu-
dent by revealing his stren h and
weakness and by measuring’ his
achievement relative to large groups.
It also evaluates the educational
system by showing weaknesses V in
teaching, what should have been
taught, and by acting as a check on
high school standards. The new type
test is said to aid recall. measure re-
tention, and, in addition, to be a
good review. A better chance for
getting good grades is afforded be-
cause of the length of the test. ll-S
wide range and many choices. S9In_e
existing evils are said to be (3111311-
nated, such as bluifing and necessity
for cramming. A number feel that
the new type test is iAmparti_a_l. Some
that it measures native ability 
should take the place of ‘intelli-
gence tests, and others that it helps
students relatively weak in English
to get a fair grade. ..

Disadvantages

‘The disadvantages are also listed
in the order of the number ocf_.t1mes
mentioned. Students seem to feel
thatit is unfair to question them on
anything not studied recently in
their courses. They felt that the
range of the best was boY°ﬂd that
of the courses taken and. that in
some cases ‘ too much time had

ied to permit students to do justice
to the examination. It seems to be
a rather sad commentary on Amer.
ican education when students feel
free to forget the subject matter of
courses after the semester examina-
tions and are piqued if questioned at
any later time on what they might
have learned previously. (2) The
tests are too long, and therefore
monotonous, tiresome and fatiguing.
(3) The students felt that the tests
encouraged bad student attitude and
performance, such as guessing,
cheating, and lack of seriousness.

Other disadvantages listed were
too many unimportant details are in-
cluded; that the tests are too gen-
eral, i. e., cover too wide a ﬁeld; and
that some of the questions are not
clear, even “tricky.” The students
Oblected to disregarding the per-
sonal equation; that is, that no op-
portunity is iven for self-expres-
slon or origina ity, no chance for ex-
planation_s, that thought questions
are not included, that it is a test
for facts only.

It should be pointed out that the
three advantages most frequently
stated. are inherent and basic to new_
type test procedure, while the three
most frequently mentioned disad-
vantages are not criticisms of new
type_ tests in general but of these
particular tests.

Of the 656 students, 37 stated that
the new type test does not permit of
originality, self-expression, organi-
zation, or explanation and is lacking
in thought questions. This is un-
doubtedly a valid criticism of most
of our present tests, although test-,-
makers have made studies in which
they‘ have found that in spite of the
fact that less opportunity is given

for expression there is a close rela-'

tionship between the latter and high
achievement on new type tests.

While this poll shows a majority
in favor of new type tests there is a
sufficiently large minority who be-
lieve otherwise to indicate the de-
sirability of having a. combination of
the two t es in most subjects in
order to ave a thorough testing
«program.

Panther
Chatter

By non LYTLE

Doc Carlson and his up and going
Panthers leave today for the “Big
City,” where they meet a fair outfit
from N. Y. U. The Violets are
noted for strong football teams and
rabid goal post-pulling supporters,
so mayhaps their ﬂoormen will be
capable of pushing the Panthersl
through four interesting periods of
passing, pivoting and shooting.

 

After the Indian; game everyone
(except a few sane people) got out
his hammer and proceeded to knock
the Pitt team, system and Coach
Carlson to a sweet fare-thee-well.
The Panthers were pictured as
weak, wobbling shadows of former
Blue and Gold stars; no one on the
squ was given credit and the sea.
son was just about over as far as.
Pitt was concerned. All this com-
ment was directed at a team which
had just beaten Dartmouth, Syra-
cuse and Purdue in successive
games. The whole thing is rather
amusing but just as ordinary as a
Pitt football team winning a. game
in November. - ~

_Csrlson’s team is in a real win-
ning mood and that system is click-
ing as well as over. All during the-
h ids season the Panthers worked
like c ampions and right now they
seem to be going through the -re-
mainder of the schedule with the
same galloping pace. .

New Stadium Range To Be
Scene of First Firing

 

In conjunction with the plan of
the University to enlarge the ath-
letic competition, the much-talked
of and much-discussed riﬂe" team is

-to become an established fact. The
entire male student body is eligible
for the team. ' '

The new range has been com-
pleted, and the first step in the

elimination of contestants will take "

place in the stadium on January 12.
Members of the team will be picked
solely upon the scores made with
the regulation riﬂe upon the targets
which will be given 0 each ‘man’.
To date, no complete nor regu-
lar schedule can be deﬁnitely an,-
__nounced. The R. 0. T. C. depart-
ment, however, is doing its best. _to
arrange, matches with various col-_
leases and a deﬁnite schedule, will
be announced at a later date. -
The riﬂe team sponsors, after un-
dergoing much trouble, expect a
large number of contestants to at-
tend the practices and they are con-
ﬁdent of turning out a team that
will do credit to the University.

Tennis prospects at the Univer-
« sity of Pittsburgh for the 1981 sea-
son are very bright. With Captain
Edward Jacobs to play number one
-singles and also to play in tho
doubles, there is no doubt that Pitt
will be the leading net team in the
East.
The other men on the team will
j be Milt Cohen, Irwin Goodman, Wal-
ter A_d‘,er and “Billy” O’Loughlan.
-captain of last year’s frosh team.
mTatala and Zola. Alpert may be
other boys on the squad.
Fresh Stars
. The outlook for the freshman
team is very encouraging due to the
fact _that stars like Nate Gsnger,
ranking junior in the middle West,
and Bill Jacobs, 1929 winner of the
Junior indoor title, are enrolled
here. Frank Shields, rated as the
Jutiiandins layer_ in the country,
may enter t e University next se-
mester. Albert Schwartz, a Brid e-
P01'l- Connecticut product, will aso
be a candidate for the team.
As edyet no schedule has been at-
rang for either team, but it is‘
understood that the Pitt varsity

WJ_ll_compete with the outstanding
tennis teams of the ‘collegiate
world.

A Cagers A Win

Three More

Dartmouth, Purdue, Orange
Fall Before Panthers

 

 

Having run up three victories out
of -four starts on their annual mid-A
western invasion, Pitt’s Golden Pan-
thers continued their onward march
It the stadium court bystaging a
great basketball carnival at the ex-

‘ pcnse of thecountry’s “big shots,”

namely, Dartmouth, Syracuse and
Purdue. Indiana was the only quin-
tet to mar the Panther record dur-
mg the elaborate. holiday card.

Coach Carlson’s dribblers went
basket shopping. on the night of De-
cember 23. and rovided a surpris-
ing spectacle to t e fans by burying
a worthy Dartmouth foe under a
lop-sided 39 to'24 score. The Pan-
thers opened up with plenty of ﬁre-
works, shooting‘ and passing bril-
hourly, and" were never headed. A
sudden scoring s lurge in the sec-
ond quarter cut itt’s lead to a 14-.
13 margin, but the locals were equal
to the occasion and soon pulled out
of danger. -—

Syracuse Loses

An old score was settled with the
redoubtablc Orangemen of Syra-
cuse when the cagemen of Pitt sped
so. furiously through the Orange
that they succumbed by a 31-28
count. Coach Lou Andreas pre-
sented the same outﬁt that trounced
Charley Hyatt and his gang‘ last
season, but the present Panther edi-
tion was right there all the way.

The Panthers struck again. This
time the Purdue Boilermakers were
the victims of one of the most hec-
tic and excitin ﬂoor battles ever
played on the S1
The ﬁnal score stood Pitt 24, Pur-
due 22. Last year's Big Ten champs
showed pllenty of skill in handling
the leat er sphere and kept the

crowd in a turmoil until the fortieth bo

minute of the tussle ticketed itself
out. After trailing 12 to 6 at the
half, the Hoosiers rallied futilely as
the great contest drew to a close.
Nevertheless, .Dr. Carlson’s bas-
keteers always managed to keep in
the front. Don Smith's all around
work featured th~ locals’ play.

A smooth working Indiana ﬁve
finally stopped the sensational win-
ning streak of the Oaklanders with
a 27-19 New Year’s downfall. Evi-
dently, the tough encounters with
Dartmouth, Syracuse and Purdue
took their toll. Indiana’s zone de-
fense checked the Panther attack
to such an extent that Pitt did not
register a ﬁeld goal until the last
period was well under Way.

The Panthers to date have chalked
up six wins against three losses and
hope to get off on another run when
y tingle with New York Univer-

ew York Saturday night.

Reveal Gate-
Crashing Fads

Sutherland, Karl E. Davis
Review Incidents

 

 

The methods used by great gate-
crashors may now be published
without hurting the boys’ feelings.
It is generally conceded that “One-
.Eye” Connolly is the best crasher,
but compared to some of the “crash-
ing,” his doings are amateurish.

The “guy wholknows the coach”
and the “guy from the coach's home

‘ town” always will tell you that he

can ﬁx you up. There is the story

about Dr. “Jock” Sutherland. While
he was visitin some friends, he re-
marked that ig they ever wanted to
see the Pitt team play, he would be

' glad to sepd them tickets. Noword
-came until the week before the

Notre Dame game and then the re-
quest was for four tickets. Suther-
land, of course, sent the tickets and
thought no more of the matter un-
til ,a note of apology came from his
friends. The tickets hadn't gone to
them at all. A third party who had
overheard Sutherland’:-1 invitation
hit upon the idea of requesting the
tickets, giving his own nearby ad-
dress and ‘signing the name of the
family with whom the Panther
coach was acquainted.

‘ Nerve Wins Out A
Karl E. Davis declared that the

guards
goes to a young man whom e en-
countered in Pittsburgh when he
was graduate manager of athletics
at Pitt. This young fellow could
get into the stadium whenever he
desired “without paying admission.
It became so bad that when Davis
would see him outside, he would
motion him to come through, as he
knew that he would manage it

—~ somehow. Davis liked the fellow on

account of his lierve.

The “gag” of wearing press
badges is worn out and many a
school reporter has been thrown
out when stating that he is repre-
senting a certain paper. Another
fuse is the “left at home" gag. The
time for the kickoff is near._ Late
comers are pouring through the
gates when suddenly, a fellow
rushes into the ticket office. “My
tickets!” he pants, “I left them at
home. ‘Please do something for
me.” This type scorns at the idea
of asking for reserved seats; but as
punishment for his error, he is will-
ing to take any ticket. He walls
and cries over the fact that he had
been waiting for this game. It is
up to the oiﬁcials to tell this fel-
low something, and, as a rule, they
tell the scout to buy other tickets.

 

Frosh Victory
String Broken

Cub Cagers Lose First Game
In Fifty-One Starts

 

Pitt’s freshman basketball team's
victorious march was ﬁnally halted
at the stadium pavilion New Year’s
night when the Scott High team of
North Braddock scored a 28-22 vic-
tory over the young Panthers who
were attempting to cop their 51st
straight victory.

The Pitt yearlings had been un-

defeated since the earl part of the
1926-1927 season and t elr record is
a remarkable one when considera-
on is made of the fact that the
personnel of the team was entirely
changed four times during the
string of victories.
Previous to this game, Kowallis’
ys had won three games this sea-
son over South High of Pittsburgh,
Johnstown Junior College and Eric
Junior College.

Macamant Out

The freshmen were handicapped
dllrlng these ‘tilts because of the
fact that Don Macamant, captain of
this year’s freshies and also cap-
tain of the Sharon Hi h team, state
scholastic champions ast year, was
unable to play due to illness.

Durinrr Macamant’s absence, Russ
Ochsenlilrt, a Perry high graduate,
was acting captain. Ochsenhirt led
the yearlings in scoring in most of
these games.

Kowallis’ lads will continue their
schedule tomorrow evening when
they play the Erie Junior College
team in a return engagement. The
-Uniontown Junior College team will
be the attraction here next Thurs-
day night.

Says Carlson

 

Dr. Carlson’s “Golden Panthers" with six victories in nine
starts, leave for New York tonight where they will encounter

Coach Cann’s New York University courtmen tomorrow night 

at the 102nd Regiment Armory

to take on winning ways since their defeat at the hands

Indiana last Thursday night.

This is the ﬁrst meeting between the two schools-in

sort of athletic competition and the
Panther courtmen are anxious to
make a good impression with the
New Yorkers. N. Y. U. is coached

by Howard G. Cann, who graduated
from there in 1918. While playing
basketball, Qann was considered one
of the ﬂashiest courtmen who ever
were the‘ Violet colors. He is as
good a basketball coach as a player,
say New York sport writers, so
Pi t will have to s ow ﬁne form to
conquer his team. The New York-
ers have already played ﬁve games,
meeting such teams as Rutgers,
Ifafayette, Toronto, Stevens and

‘ Violets Strong

In their lineup they boast “Jerry”
Nemecek, who was captain of the
football‘ team, and who is also the
skipper of the basketball team.
“Jerry” is reputed to be one of the
fiashiesft guards in the East this
year. Monty Banks has 19. ed a

Dr. Carlson is conﬁdent that his
courtmen will down New York but
is still worried over the injuries of

Carlson says that  Kowallis will

last year’s squad and Thiessen, a
sophomore, will run in these races
for the Panthers.

Utterback is the lone Pitt hope
in the high jump and in the broad
jump since Cooper left school. He
can be counted upon to win these
events in every meet but seconds
and thirds will be few for Pitt.

The Panthers will be weak again
in the pole vault this year even
though last year’s entire brigade is
back. McConnell and Connell are
hold-overs from the varsity while
Ericcson is a sophomore. None of
these men can clear 111/. feet with
regularity and this height will not
win in many meets. ‘

Weights Real Problem

Coach Shea’s real problem lies in
the weight events where all but
two of the performers are football
men. Johnny Luch is Pitt’s best
bet in the discus and in the hammer
throw. Weiler is the lone non-
gridder who can be counted upon to
place in the discus. Luch is a prob-
able ﬁrst place winner in both of
his events and without him, the
Panthers would be in a sorry plight.

The same condition also holds
true in the shot put where Jim Mac-
Murdo and Weiler are Pitt's best.
If both Luch and MacMurdo are
able to compete in the weight
events, that department will be the
strongest it has been since the
graduation of “Gibby” Welch.

In the javelin throw, Shea will
have Ray Kopnicki and Joe Tormey,
a member of the football squad.
Last year was the first in which
Kopnicki attempted tp throw a jave-
lin, and he won the “Big Four”
championship with a toss of 169
feet. Kopnicki is expected to im-
prove this year and he should co_p
ﬁrst place in at least half of his
dual meets.

Two indoor meets have deﬁnitely
been scheduled for the -Panthers
with a third being tentative. One
of these meets will be held in Mor-
gantown the latter part of Febru-
ary while‘ another will be held at
the same place early in March. Ten
men may be sent to Cleveland for
the third indoor meet.

Ten Meets Scheduled

The outdoor schedule includes five
dual meets and ﬁve championship
affairs. The duals will be held with
Ohio State, West Virginia and
Army, abroad, and with Carnegie
Tech and Penn State at the stadium.
The championship affairs include the
Ohio Relays, Penn Relays, I. C. A.
A. A. A. championships, N. C. A.
A. championships and the “Big
Four” meet.

The complete schedule follows:

April 18——Oh.io State, Columbus.

phia.

Mortar Board Lists
Outstanding Women

The recognition list, put over
every year by Mortar Board, will
be announced and distributed next
week. The list will be given out
by members of Mortar Board who
will wear their symbolic caps dur-
ing the week. The list will appear
in the form of a pamphlet which
every University woman will get.

Much interest will be displayed in
this recognition of prominent wom-
en on the campus. The group is
being selected from approximately
900 women attending the University.
This includes all in professional
schools, besides those in the under-
graduate schools.

The selection is based on the in-
dividual’s scholastic record, a C av-
erage, with no failures or incom-
plete Work for 1929-1930.

Activities are the second basis of
selection. The person must have
been active on campus, and her
work well done.

The women are not selected ac-
cording to requirements for mem-
bership to Mortar Board, but in ac-
cordance with the policy of the fra-
ternity, which is to foster student
activities.

In co-operation with the various
settlement leaders in the city wom-
en from the physical education de-
partment are spending their leisure
time in the afternoon andevening
by teaching classes at the settle-
ment houses. The work in classes
varies from athletic sports, ‘as
basketball and volleyball to various
formal drills and recreational play.

“The recreational side of settle-
ment work done by the majors,”
states Mrs. Tracy, teacher in Phys-
ical Education, “ought to help the
settlements considerably because if
children are appealed to through
their play instinct, they will gradu-
ally become interested in other
worth while things carried on by the
settlement workers.”

The physical education majors do-
ing the work are: Alice Aibeck, Ed.
’32; Kate Clark, Ed. ’34; Margy
Kline, Ed. ’33; Mary Kovac, Ed. ’32;
Isabelle Murphy, Ed. ’34; Peggy
Perkins, Ed. ’34; Marie Wall, Ed.
'33, and Virginia Witﬁeld, Ed. ’32.

The classes which they teach vary
in size each week according to the
weather. Virginia Witﬁeld of Kings-
ley Settlement states: “Some weeks
I have all the way to thirty in my
class while other times there are
only seven; this makes it impossi-
ble to have any deﬁnite schedule ar-
ranged.” ‘

The majors ﬁnd the work very
worth while and beneﬁcial. Miss
Wall, working at Soho Community
house, states: “I am learning how

Pitt Group Will Present
“Captain Applejack”

Clarence Sober, Dent. ’31, is rap-
idly assuming the blood-thirsty
shape of Captain Applejack under
the direction of Carl Cass, director
of the current Pitt Player Produc-
tion. He plays the part of a coun-
try gentleman who gets tired of
stagnating on the family estate and
decides to sell his farm. Then he
hears of an ancestor, a pirate who
terrorized the neighbors; and the
play results when Mr. Applejohn
“reforms” and becomes Captain Ap-
plejack.

The cast is Elaine Blauvalt, Col.
’34; Mary Agnes Vitchestain, Col.
'31; Barbara Ann Hartmann, Col.
’33; Ruth Drum, Col. ’34; Carl
Swartz, Col. ’34; Roy A. Magram,

Herbert D. Fine, Mines ’34;‘George

“Captain Applejack” promises to
contain all the thrill and romance
of life in a pirate camp. This “Ara-
bian Night's Adventure in Three
Acts” will be presented February
10 at the Y. M. and Y. W. H._A
auditorium. The technical staff, un-

Phi Eps Award Cup 9
To Leading Chapters

At its twenty-sixth annual conven-
tion held last week at the William
Penn I-Iotel, Phi Epsilon Pi, nation-
al fraternity, awarded its annual ac-
tivities and scholarship cups to
Lambda and to Alpha Gamma chap-
ters, respectively.

Lambda Chapter, Rutgers Uni-
versity, had among its members the
captains of four varsity sports and
the managers of three varsity
sports. ‘The Miami Chapter was
also well represented on its cam-
pus, having many of the officers of
the different class organizations as
members. 

Alpha Gamma chapter, University
of Michigan, headed the list of chap-
ters that maintained exceptionally
high scholastic averages. Seven
chapters of the fraternity excelled
all other fraternities on their re-
spective campuses in scholastic at-
tainment. Of the ten members of
the Johns Hopkins chapter, three
were made Phi Betta Kappas in a
total of eight students selected for
that honor.

to teach games and at the same
time more about children.”

The women like the work and find
it very interesting. Miss Clark, at
Brashear Settlement of South Side,
says that, “although the gymnasium
is very bare and there is little
equipment I like my work because I
feel that I am receiving response
and my girls work hard.”

To all doing the work it is very
new to them. Althouglf Miss Kline
is very new at the game she states:
“I would like very much, some day,
to head a settlement. Since I have
been working at Soho Settlement, I
have learned the true signiﬁcance of
such work.”

Every worker ﬁnds the children
who come to the settlement houses
eager to play. At two of the houses
the children who do not have gym
shoes are willing to play _in their
stocking feet.

One of the majors, Miss Kovac, is
so interested and enthused about
settlement work that she is doing
the work at two houses, Soho and
Brashear. Miss Kovac states that
she is anxious to apply to_ her Work
the theories she has received from
her Pitt training. _

Alice Walton, Ed. '31, president
of W. A. A., agrees that the settle-
ment work for the women majoring
in physical education is very good
for them; she states: “It gives them
special training which is very.he1p-
ful to them and something which in
their theoretic training they would
not rebeive.”

Profs. Amés_‘s-l.217~
Lrsted In Directory

If you think that the profs and

administrative officials are the only

ones who make up the University
of Pittsburgh’s organization, read

the University directory. You'll ﬁnd

that over two hundred persons
whose occupations include glass-
blowers, mechanics, photographers,
clerks, stenographers and curators
are connected with Pitt.

According to the directory, out of
the 1,217 people listed, 851 are mar-
ried. Two hundred and sixty—nine
wpmen are employed by the Univer-
Sl y.

There must be quite a strain of
Scotch among Pitt"s officials, facul-
ty and clerical assistants, for ﬁfty-
ﬁve names beginning with “Me”
are listed.

Jones heads the list as a popular
name, with a total of thirteen, fol-
lowed by eleven Johnstons, ten
Smiths, seven Whites and six
Browns.

Sixteen hundred copies of the di-
rectory were printed and distributed
this year.

 

Free Literature On

Racks Placed By ‘Y’

Inaugurating a new method of
distributing free literature among
students, the university Y. M. C. A.
will install racks in all campus

 

0 buildings next week.‘ The literature

will be of a religious or character-
building nature, and will be supplied
to the students.

The pamphlets and reprinted
magazine articles will be of a.high
quality. Some of the-authors of the
literature to be distributed include
Robert A. Millikan, the Nobel prize
winner in hysics; Harry Emerson
Fosdick, li eral minister; Michael
Pupin, physicist; Shailer Mathews,
philosopher; Edwin B. Frost, astron-

- omer, and Samuel C. Schmucker and

Edwin G. Conklin, biologists.
Rather than deal with an estab-
lished concern, the Y. M. C. A. or-
dered the racks from the Good Will
Industries and thus provided some
work for the unemployed to which
that organization gives training‘.

.’3l Owl Motif

Cathedrals and Manuscript:
Will Provide Theme

A medieval manuscript, with all
its color and its quaint and beauti.
ful art work, is the motif that has
been embodied in the designs for the
1931 Owl. Sample
pared by the artists of the S. K.
Smith Company of Chicago, 111.,
foremost in the ﬁeld of yearbook d
signing, have been submitted to the
editorial board of the publication.

Division pages for the book are
being prepared after designs of
French Cathedral windows. Artists
of the Bureau of Engraving of Min-
neapolis are drawing these pages.
Inserts, dedication page and other
features of the book are being rap-
idly completed by the engravers.

This year’s book will feature a
Campus view section of sixteen
pages to contain eight steel etch-
ings that have been made by Brad-
bury of the bureau. Another inno-
vation will be a twenty-four page
section devoted exclusively to the
three junior colleges, Johnstown,
Erie and Uniontown. Lé

The 1931 Owl will include for thé
ﬁrst time a picture and paragraph
of every senior who subscribes.
