fEx1'§ KS AT PITT

 

Summer, 2008 ‘ The Pitt News 0_ wvvw.pittnews.com

The goal of our Universi-
ty’s founder, expressed when
Pittsburgh sat at the edge of
the American frontier, was to
establish: a school‘ that would
serve a”s’\"“a‘ lite in/the forested
wilderness.” Though the West-
ern. Pennsylvania wilderness
has long been gone, our shared
need for “learning’s light” re-
mains every bit as intense as it
was in 1787, and you are about
to join an academic commu-
nity with a proud 220—year-old
tradition grounded in teach-
ing excellence, pioneering re-
search and' a deep commitment
to advancing the public good.

Each of you is a gifted in-
dividual with your own unique
set of talents, experiences and
ambitions. During your time as
a student here, you willhave
special opportunities to live
and learn and grow._You will
enjoy the many satisfaetions

of a stimulating college expe- I

rience, even as you build the
foundation for the much longer
life that lies beyond your un-
dergraduate years. Let me of-
fer the following bits of advice
in the hope that they will help
you take full advantage of ev-
erything that awaits you here.

Set your sights, high. Our'

goal is to provide all our stu-
dents with the chance to be
the best they can be in every-
thing they do. In the process,

On behalf of the Student
Government Board’, I would
like to welcome you to the
University of Pittsburgh.

During the next four years
(five if you’re like me) you
will be exposed to thousands
of different opportunities. I
strongly encourage you to take
advantage of as many of these
as you can, whether it’s study-
ing abroad, participating in an
incredible co—op or as ‘simple
as a road trip to an away foot-
ball game.

The best advice I can give

we know that some of our best
will become the best that any-
one can be. As our record of
producing Rhodes, Marshall,
Goldwater,'Truman, Udall and
Churchill ‘scholars so clearly
demonstrates, Pitt students
can compete effectively with
the very best students from
this country’s ﬁnest universi-
ties. You would not be a part of

this class if we did not believe V

that you have the ability to ex-
cel, so set ambitious goals and
work hard to achieve them.
These years of your life are too
valuable for you to settle for
anything less.

Learn from each other. You
and your classmates are “in it”

together, and you have a lot to V

offer each other. You probably
have the most to learn from
your interactions with students
whose experiences and per-
spectives are different from
your ow_n. The largerworld is
multicultural, and Pitt is a mi-
crocosm of it..By immersing
yourself in the diversity that
exists here, you will be better
preparing yourself for the ex-
periences that await you in the
real world.

Take full advantage of all
your professors have to of-
fer. Pitt is a large and com-
plex institution charged with
advancing multiple missions.
However, our most fundamen-

Student body

.you is to make sure you have
fun and enjoy your time here.
The.University lets you study
what you want to study, so
take classes that you enjoy.

Go -to athletic events.‘ Our bas-

ketball team is coming off of —

a Big East Conference" Cham-
pionship, and they look still
more promising this year.

Our football team ended
last year’s season with a huge
win against West Virginia, and
they are capable contenders
coming into the conference
this year.‘

tal responsibilities involve our
work with those as who are cur-
rently enrolled as our students.

There is a strong cultural com—'

mitment to teaching here, and
that commitment extends far

beyond the formal classroom V

hour. Our faculty members are

scholars because they are dedi-I
cated to advancing understand— -,

ings of their own disciplines.
They are teachers because they
want to share their knowledge
and insights with you. Make
sure you give them the full op-
portunity to do so.

Get to know your new home. '

Our Oakland campus includes
buildings that are historic and
buildings that are modern.
Structures like the Cathedral

of Learning, the Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial, Heinz Chapel,
Alumni Hall and the William

Pitt Union are architectural’

treasures that could never be
replicated today. The campus
also includes new, state—of—the-
art facilities, some of which
are classics in their own right.
From the magniﬁcent Petersen
Events Center to our new hill-
top residence halls to our new-
est Biomedical Science Tower,
Pitt is growing for the future.
Explore life beyond the

A campus. As exciting as life in

Oakland can be, the larger re-

gion has additional things to

offer, and capitalizing on West-
ern Pennsylvania’s many assets

should be one of the beneﬁts of '

living and learning in a great
city like Pittsburgh. Without

. ‘having to look very hard, you

can_ﬁnd museums and art gal-

, leries’, jazz and classical mu-

sic, opera and ballet, theater
and professional sports. You
can plan your own excursions
or participate in local events
on a low—cost basis through
the Pitt Arts program. And in
thinking about life-altering

_ ways to expand your horizons,

you should seriously consider

making a study abroad experi-

ence a part of your education.
Begin planning your fu-

ture. Be forward thinking in

planning that much-longer

- portion of your life that will

follow your years here at Pitt.
Though your life’s map almost
certainly will change, it never

is too early to begin shaping.

your life’s goals and charting
the course to achieve them.
We have programs that are de-
signed to integrate academic
and career planning by helping
you assess your own strengths
and weaknesses, inventory
your interests and position
you for internships or service-
learning experiences. Each of

these can be an important step .

in creating a well—conceived
plan for the future.

Take care of yourself and
have fun. Among our most
fervent wishes is the hope that
you will be healthy and happy
throughout your years at Pitt.
Youth, too often, carries with

it a false sense of invulnerabil—. C
ity. In fact, you need to take _

care of yourselves. And in the
midst of the "very real satis-
factions that come from hard
work and the achievements
that work can produce, _you
also need to have fun. Take the
time to make friends and to do
the things that are fun for you.

These ought to be great years

in every sense —— and we all

A look forward to sharing them.

with you‘.
Welcome to Pitt!
-Chancellor Mark Nordenberg

president says hello

Make sure you explore the
city. Pitt is located in an urban
area and the city of Pittsburgh
is your campus. _

Take advantage of campus
life. My "freshman year at Pitt

was one of the best years of my I
life. I lived in Towers, which I.

realize does not initially look

like the greatest place to live. ~
- However, I_wish I could h-ave

lived in Towers ‘all four‘ years
of college. While in» Towers
or other residence halls, you
are going to meet tons of new
people, some of whom you

will start 1ife—long friendships
with. ‘ ' ‘.
You have the opportunity
to join a‘ fraternity or a soror-
ity at Pitt, or if that’s not for
you, there are also hundreds of
different student organizations
that you can participate in.
Pitt is greatabout offering
activities that cater to all kinds

._ of different interests and back-

grounds. . .
I loved the four years I hav
spent here and am thrilled to
have one more semester. There
are many opportunities that I

didn’t take advantage of, but I

am pleased to -have been a part

of those I did.

I wish you well as you be-
gin this chapter of your life.
Take advantage of'what Pitt
has to offer, study ,hard but,
most importantly, have the
time of your life because the
opportunity to do so is there.

‘ATHLETIC

Summer, 2008

Class of 2012, meet

Congratulations, you’ve made it
to page four of The Pitt News New
Student Guide. Only 128 more to
go!

It’s a lot of reading, I know. But
what you’re holding in your hands,

V this meager pile of newsprint and

paper, may be one of the most help-
‘ ful compendiurns of knowledge
you’ll run across this summer.

Long before I became editor in
chief at The Pitt News, the summer
before Pitt christened me a college
student, I read this baby cover to
cover. And I learned a lot.

In the pages of the New Student
Guide, you’ll read where to ﬁnd
Pittsburgh’s hottest hangouts, who
the most inﬂuential administrators
and student groups are on campus
and how to deal with the delicate is-

. sues of student life.

Our hardworking news desk,
the creative folk from over at A&E,
a troop of veteran columnists, our
home team of sports buffs and a
meticulous group of editors, page
designers and business ‘staffers
came together to bring you these
pages.

_Not only did we deliver to you
this issue, but we’ll also be the news
source throughout your time at Pitt.
During the fall and spring, we put
out a paper every day, Monday
through Friday, and about l4,0()0
issues ﬁll up newsstands around
-campus and in the city. This sum-
mer, you’ll see a new edition every
week on Wednesdays.

About 150 dedicated students
sit on our editorial staff and provide
ouroriginal content, and about 25
students on the business side take

care of selling the advertising (more

than $1 million worth of it every
year) that keeps us an independent,
student-um organization.

Impressed? If you’re not, pick
up a copy of The Pitt News off the
rack on your way to class or surf
into www.pittnews.com, our online
edition, on a regular basis. You’l1 at
least have a fresh, clean Sudoku or
crossword puzzle to ﬁll out during
lectures. _ ,

If you don’t like what We’re do-
ing, that’s all thebetter. Let us know,
and we’ll listen! If there’s anything
you’d ever like to comment on, any

  ‘ The Pitt News

article that really tickles your funny
bone or pisses you oﬁf, or the fact
thatwe might be missing a comma
here or there, give me a call at 412-
648-7985. I’d love to hear what you
have to say.

You also '_ Could send your
thoughts on any ar11'cle we print or
any issue we comment on to our
lovely Opinions editors at letters@
pittnewscom. Your words might
wind up as a letter to the editor in
the Opinions section. Or in the pa-
per shredder — just kidding.

.If you like what you see here,
we have a better option for you. You
should work for us.

We’re always accepting applica-
tions for writers in our News, Arts
and Entertainment, Opinions and
Sports Sections, for illustrators, car-
toonists and graphic designers in our
layout department, for sports and
news photographers to bring you
the visuals to brighten up articles,
and for a Web tech genius to work
on our online staff. Don’t worry,
you don’t have to be an expert jour-
nalist or even have taken a writing
course. We’ll teach you everything
you need to know, as long as you’re
excited and willing to learn.

Once a Pitt News staifer, you

' can get a head start strengthening

your writing skills, you’ll garner
sweet clips of your name in print
to add to your blossoming resume,

_and you might even make some V

friends. Plus, we’ll pay you for your
hard work. »

That’s right, working for The Pitt
News is a real job, and it’s deﬁnitely
more fun than bagging groceries or

' ﬂipping burgers. «

R Stop by our ofﬁce on the fourth
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union to
say “Hi” anytime or to pick up an
application — our business staff and
I are here every dayinthe summer,
and the newsroom buzzes on Tues-
day nights with our team of editors
hard at work. We’d love to meet
you, Class of 2012.

Have a relaxing summer and
a fantastic four (or more) years in
Oakland. _ ‘

And always, hail to Pitt!

by Drew Singer
New Editor

As an incoming freshman, you’re
almost deﬁnitely going to call the
neighborhood of Oakland home this
year. While Oakland might appear
quiet — perhaps even quaint —— for

_ ,a city neighborhood, don’t  fooled.

There is far more to Oakland than
meets the eye. _

You are entering an-Oakland di-
vided, a neighborhood. in the midst
of a silent civil war.

To the untrained eye, Oakland as
an entity issirnple: ‘two big streets
—— Forbes  avenues —with
apartments ar1d_U_niversity buildings
littered  a single community in
aperfunctory'existence. '

Oakland is divided into three
parts. What most ‘students refer to
as South Oakland _—- the streets in
between Forbes Avenue and Bates
Street —I is actually Central Oak-

land. Beyond the glamour_ of Forbes I

Avenue, South Oakland -‘consists of

mostly off-campusihousiirrg, with the ‘

exception of BouquetGardens, Pitt’s
answer to apar1rnent—styleliving. I
South‘*;Oakland residents usu-
ally don’t choose to live there for the
luxmy. These apartments are close
to campus,’an'd there is a special ca-
maraderie South Oakland residents
share. I '
While generally less expensive
than its northern counterpart, you
will often awake to ﬁnd the streets

' of South Oakland littered with trash,

broken glass and inebriated stu-

. dents.

North Oakland, while just on the
other side of Fifth Avenue, is a totally
dilferent world. If neighborhoods

.54.": ,;_

were people, North Oakland and

South Oakland would be the bitter ‘

relatives that don’t talk at Thanksgiv-
ing dinner and make it awkward for
the rest of the family. ,

North Oakland apartments vary

  campus,-ranging-~ 

from “acceptable” to “acceptable
when the temperature is more than
35 degrees.” North Oakland is usu-
ally quieter, cleaner and more expen-
sive than the south.

Speaking of quiet and. clean,
many fraternity houses can be found
in parts of North Oakland.

The real South Oakland lies be-
yond Bates Street. Generally, “The
Forgotten Oaldan ,” as I just now
decided to nickname it, consistsof
more locals as the walk to campus
starts to get a bit lengthy. '

While navigating Oakland, a re-
sourceful student can use his or her

surroundings to help lead the way. I
 Avenue travels into the city —

remember the in “Fifth” goes in

' 4 while Forbes Avenue leads trafﬁc
' out ‘— remember the “o” in “Forbes”

goes out — while both streets are

I one-way, Fifth Avenue has a bus lane

traveling against trafﬁc, so be careful
when seeking the right bus stop. ‘
The -Cathedral of Learning. is

viewable from almost everywhere 

Oakland, be it north or south.
No matter where in Oakland
your travels might take you, and no

matter which side of the civil war '

you inevitably back, take solace in
knowing that to the untrained eye,
it’s all just‘ Oaldand Outsiders will
never understand. ‘

South Oakland has itall

by Lewis Lehe_ ’

Colum/ztitt

   
 

I grew up in Birmingham,-

Ala. Ever since, I’ve preferred
-the soulful and dilapidated‘
Southern ‘side of ‘ anything.
South Oakland is -no excep-
tion. It’s nothing to write home
about, but after a semester,
it will be your. home. Today,
I’ll mince the myths and‘ tell
you about the many meritsof
South Oakland!

Segregation. Sou_th -Oak-
land suffered from segregation
in the past, but today North
Oakland has more segrega-

tion. All of South Oak1and’s_

college kids go to the same
school: Pitt. But in North.Oak-
land, some kids have to attend
a dismal little institute called

’ Carnegie Mellon, blocks from
' anything

awesome. There,
they getuseful technical train-
« ingebut miss out on the liberal

‘learning it takes to get ahead
“ in-‘thefworld. ‘? = ' A ‘- “  

Cuisine. South-‘Oakland is
famous for delicious and greasy .

foods. During your visit, don’t
forget to loosen that belt a few
F notches for one of our famous

$5 pizzas at Antoon’s or Sor-

rento’s. Other South Oakland
faves include -Rice—A—Roni,

Hamburger Helper, turkey ba-.

con and Eggo Waffles.

Rude Police. Sadly, here is
a legacy that has yet to fade.
A_t Halloween, an officer gave
me a citation for disorderly
conduct. The whole time she
kept asking all about what
kind of fancy college I went to
and whether the hens and dan-

dies that went there were good

at anything besides prancing
at masquerades and festooning
antique wardrobes. If , you’re
stopped, reply, “No, and not
one of the lotof us can change
a daggurn tire, for Pete’s sake!”
The officer wants this answer.
Distance. Everyone thinks
South Oakland is far away.
But it’s actually where all the
action is. Wisely, Pitt’s forefa-
thers founded Pitt’s capital on

the boundary between North’

and South Oakland,‘ on the
Forbes—Fifth. line. We’re no
fartheraway than the North-
erners, and we have less .traf-
fic. ' ’
Immigration. South Oak-

‘ ‘~"~?"-land',is host‘ to ‘several’ vibrant

immigrant communities. In re-
cent years, vibrant Hispanics

have been arriving across the ,

border with Mexico. We also
enjoy the company of vibrant
Indians and vibrant Middle
Easterners. It’s a melting pot
of countless traditions side-
by-vibrant-side!

Hospitality. South Oakland-

Michal Heaterl Photo Editor

ers are famous for their hospi-
tality. Walking the lazy streets
on a steamy afternoon, don’t
be frightened when locals
call from their front porches.
Theyjust-"want to say, “Hello,
ya’1l!” In the fall twilight, it’s
easy to catch them lined up on
busted, old couches on peeling
front‘ porches, while crooning
Neutral Milk Hotel and strum-
ming acoustic guitars. North
Oaklanders, on the other hand,
don’t have porches, since they
live in cramped apartments.
They just want to bump into
you and say, “I’m walkin’

here!” on their way to classes ' '

Station

by Estelle Tran
Aadiutarzt New Editor

Though there are no longer

trains turning into Station Square,

1 the old train station is now the place
to turn to for unique tours, diverse
restaurants and specialty clothing
stores.

Station Square is a historical and
commercial attraction for locals and
tourists. It’s a family attraction by
day and a hot spot by night

To get to Station Square, stu-
dents can ride any inbound 71, 61

or 500 bus Downtown. Or after a "

short trek to the “T” station atWood
Street, students can catch one of
Pittsburgh’s light rail trains to Sta-
tion Square. Once aboard a 47L,
47S— or 42S train, the ride to Station
Square takes about ﬁve minutes.
People who aren’t familiar with
Pittsburgh might enjoy a guided
tour of the city.

sightseeing excursions ﬁve times a
day, Monday through Friday. Ho —
ever, in May, September and Octo-
ber, there are weekend cruises for
$11 a ticket. The Gateway Clipper
also has other cruise options, often
with themes and concerts.
Walking and bus tours are pretty
common, especially during college
visits. Boat tours might not seem
like a novelty either, but how about
an amphibious adventure?
On a Just Ducky tour, 30 people
can ride in a revitalized World War
II DUKW. The amphibious trucks
take riders on a one-hour tour of
Downtown’s business and cultural
districts before plunging into the
Allegheny River.
The ticket booth is located in front
of the Bessemer Court. For $19 a
person, passengers can explore the
city’s streets and three rivers. '
After your DUKW docks, it will
probably be time ‘for lunch. The

Oakland's off-campus eats

by Giles Howard
Contributdzg Eaitor
Sometimes, the. meal plan just
doesn’t cutit.
Market Central is only open so

many hours of the day, and 3 am.

isn’t one of them. But there’s more
to Oakland cuisine than what’s pro-
vided by the University. Infact, Oak-
land is home to food at good prices if
you’re willing to venture away from
your meal plan.

A lot of Oakland eateries have

. late night deals.

The new Souf Oakland Steaks
shop on Atwood Street specializes
in cheesesteaks, and between 1 and 3
am. on Thursday, Friday and Satur-
day, they’re only $5.

Just up the street are two pizze-
rias that offer $5 deals of their own.
Sonento’s Pizza Roma operates a
$5 large cheese pizza deal every day
after8p.m. andalsosellsanumber
of other Italian food items. Antoon’s
Pizza is well known for its $5 large
cheese pizza —— no time constraints
onthispizzaplace’s price — and, like
Sonento’s, olfers other food items in-

cluding great-priced hoagies.

The McDona1d’s on Forbes Av— A
_enue is another late-night stop. It’s

in a convenient location, between
Oakland and Atwood streets, for Pitt
students and olfers fast food to Oak-
land’s college population 2Al7. .

But Oakland also offers a number
of food options if you’re looking for
arestauranttositdowninatareason—
able hour.

Prirnanti Brothers is a local
chain with one restaurant located‘
on Forbes. It is known for its unique
style of sandwich building in which
coleslaw and ﬁench fries are served
not on the. side but rather between the
two pieces of bread in the sandwich
itself. This Pittsburgh tradition was
started back in the day when min-
ers didn’t have time on their lunch
breaks to eat their fries, so they put
them right inside their sandwiches.

Another eatery that’s made_ a
nameforitselfin the city isThe Orig-

inal Hotdog Shop, also located on

Forbes. The O, as it is known around
Oakland, is famous for its hotdogs

but also prepares french fries, pizza-

and a variety of other greasy-spoon
staples. For people of age, The O
hasaselectionofbeerfor sale until2
am. ' .

_Pamela’s on Forbes Avenue is
another Pittsburgh instiurtion. It’s the
place to go for breakfast in Oakland,
but be prepared for a wait, as there is
sometimes a line stretching outside
the restaurant on weekend mom-
in§iS- _

Like Pamela’s, Uncle Sarn’s Subs
has a number of locations through-
out the city of Pittsburgh, and one of
them is on’Oakland Avenue, seconds
from Forbes Avenue. .

' As the name suggests, Uncle.
Sam’s is a sub shop, but it’s also a
Pittsburgh establishment Oakland is
home to a Subway and a Quiznos as
well, but only in Pittsburgh can you
ﬁnd an Uncle Sarn’s.

Five Guys Burgers and Fries
might not be unique to Pittsburgh,
but it is a favorite of Pitt students.
Located next to the 0, Five Guys is
your destination if you’re searching
for large quantities of fries, famous
burgers and free peanuts. While

Kathy Humphrey

by  Remizowski
Senior Staff Wrder

Kathy Humphrey has two

sons —— twin O16-year-old boys.’

She worries about them like
any mother would, especially
now that they’re in the process
of getting their drivers’ licens-
es.

But when herphone rings at.

3 a.m. alerting her of a mishap
or injury, it could be any one
of the thousands of kids who

depend on her. _

“I don’t know every student
here, but I’m responsible for

-them,” said Humphrey, Pitt’s

vice provost and dean of stu-
dents.

This two-titled job descrip-
tion alludes tohow busy she
is.

Humphrey spends her days
managing Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Stu-
dent Affairs, which includes

an organization on just about
every ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union.

Her other duties include
helping Pitt reach its retention
and diversity goals, recruit-
ment and reviewing faculty for
tenure, among other things:

She even teaches a student
development theory class.

If a student needs her, Hum-
phrey ‘will "change her day’s
plan without ﬂinching.

“If anything happens to a
student, I’m there,” she said.
“No day is" typical.” . I

Humphrey likes

‘‘I’m not a lay-on—the—beach
kind of person,” she said of
how she handles what little

minutes of TV every night, or
rather, it watches me.”

Downtown  

by J essel August Costa III
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh’s Downtown is
packed with'250 years of his-
tory and heritage, but it also
has a lot to offer the students of
the surrounding high schools,
colleges and universities.

Downtown—pronounced
“Daahn-tawhn”. by those who
have lived in the city long
enough to learn its unique
—houses some of
Pittsburgh’s largest and most
important businesses, govern-
ment ofﬁces and even a sports
arena.

Traveling down Fifth Av-
enue on the way into town, the
ﬁrst thing that comes into View

is the home of the Pittsburgh '

Penguins, the Igloo, Mellon
Arena.

Here, students can buy leftover
Pens tickets for $20 if they’re

willing to stand in line for.

hours before the puck drops.

If hockey isn’t cool enough
for you, there is plenty of shop-
ping available Downtown as
well.

For starters, there is an

enormous Macy’s. department_

store in the center of town, not
to mention a Saks Fifth Avenue
(which is, oddly enough, locat-

ed not on Fifth Avenue but on
Smithﬁeld Street), a Burling-
ton Coat Factory and countless
other shops, boutiques and even
some high-end clothing retail-
ers spread throughout the city.

A If you’re looking to turn a
shopping trip into an all—day
adventure, then, it is helpful to
point out that'Downto_wn Pitts-
burgh is also the location of an
incredible number of restau-
rants guaranteed to suit even
the most discriminating diner.

Seinfeld fans out there might
be interested to know that there
is even a soup shop themed af-
ter the famous Soup Nazi “No
soup for you” episode called
The Original SoupMan.

Broke? Why not enjoy the
priceless architectural beauty
of the city itself? The city of
Pittsburgh’s ‘Grant and Ross
streets strip is the home to some
of the oldest and most aestheti-
cally pleasing buildings in the
area. *

Take the city’s, courthouse

and juvenile courthouse (for-
merly the _city’s jail), for ex-

ample. These buildings, with
their 100-plus-year-old stone
ediﬁces, stand opposite each
other connected by a stone
bridge above the street.

Built by H.R. Richard-
son, the architect behind such
amazing buildings as the Mar-
shall Field Store in Chicago
as well as the Trinity Church
in Boston, the courthouse and
juvenile courthouse are both
recognized as historical monu-
ments. . *

With more than 260. acres ‘ of
shopping, restaurants, clubs and
‘other entertainment venues, the
Waterfront outdoor "mall in Home-
stead remains an exciting hot spot
for young people in Pittsburgh.
No matter what Pitt’s students

‘need to _buy, with more than 70"

stores, the Waterfront is equipped to
satisfy anyone’s shopping cravings.

Students can try on designer Ver-
sace, Prada or Ralph Lauren shades
at the Sunglass Hut or browse shoes
on the clearance rack at DSW or
New Balance Pittsburgh.‘They can
experience innovative electronic
media at Best Buy or Radio Shack,
upgrade old cell phones at Sprint or
Verizon Wireless or pick up work
supplies at Ofﬁce Depot .

To discover the latest fashion
trends, students can turn to 15 dif-
ferent, clothing stores including
Abercrombie & Fitch, American
Eagle Outﬁtters, Ann Taylor Loft,

_Express, Old Navy, V1ctoria’s Se-
cret, Limited Too, Dress Bam, The
Men’s Wanehouse and Wet Seal.
The Waterfront is also home to
ﬁve additional department stores:
Filene’s Basement, Macy’s, Mar-
shalls, Target and TJ Maxx.

If students are looking for a
more relaxing atmosphere, they
may curl up with a book or maga-
zine at Barnes and Noble, pamper
themselves at the Venetian Salon
and Spa, sample Moonlight Path
body lotion at Bath & Body ‘Works,
throw a football at Dick’s Sporting
Goods or sip an espresso at Star-
bucks.

Although students can spend
entire afternoons traversing through
the Waterfront’s lighted walkways,
the mall’s buzzing nightlife draws

. crowds of young people every

weekend. , .

\V1thin the AMC Loews Theater,
students may watch movies on one
of the theater’s 20 screens. Tickets
cost $9 at the door or one may pre-
order them online at Fandango.com
or MovieTickets.com.

For those 21 and older, Dave

' and Buster~’s video game arcade,

bar and restaurant is a popular adult
playground. VV1th games like‘ Day-
tona USA, Dance Dance Revo-
lution and Spin—N—Wm, students

might easily lose themselves in the

scene. The Improv Comedy Club
also hosts regular and visiting co-
medians throughout the week who
are sure to keep guests hunched
over in their chairs with laughter.

in Pittsburgh

by Liz Navratil
Stzzﬂi Writer

In high school, it was sim-
ple. There was always a par-
ent or a teacher hovering over
you telling you what to do and
what not to do. With college
comes the added responsibility
of watching out for yourself.

But don’t fret. Pitt Police
chief Tim Delaney said it’s
easy to sum up how _to stay‘
safe.

“Please use common
sense,” said Delaney. “Some
[students] have it and some of
them don’t.”

Pitt police ofﬁcer Ron Ben-
nett expanded upon the idea.
He said the majority of crimes
on campus occur because peo-
ple are careless.

Bennett said many times
people will leave their laptops
unattended or leave their dorm
rooms wide open because they

think they’re on a closed cam— 9

pus. Thieves, he said, often
take advantage of these situa-
tions. ‘ I . I .
Crimes on campus aren’t
always opportunistic like this,
though.‘ I P . I g ,
The U.S. Department of

, Justice estimates that drug use

is a factor in at le 41 percent
of all violent crimes involving
college students.

Violent crimes and thefts
aren’t the only situations cam-
pus police deal with, though.

“We know there are situa— 3

tions where [underage drink-
ing] occurs,” said Bennett.

“Some people can actually
control their portion, and some
can’t.” A

Web sites like RUPissed.
com and mystudentbody.com

by Liz Navratil
Staﬁ’ Writer

The year was 1969. Crowds
ﬂocked to Woodstock, the Unit-
ed States started withdrawing
troops from Vietnam, and Pitt
police chief Tim Delaney took
his ﬁrst steps into the Allegh-
eny County Police Academy.

He would go on to join the
Pitt police as a guard in 1972.
Years later, he would become
the chief. ’

The decision to become an
ofﬁcer, he said, was a fairly
simple one.

Delaney said he was follow-
ing in_hisfather’s footsteps. He
is the second of three genera-
tions of Delaneys to be afﬁliat-
ed with the University. His son
attended Pitt’s School of Law

wasn’t just a part of his blood.
Working forPitt allowed Dela-
ney to improve his communi-

' ty.

“I’m a product of the ’60s,”
he said. “When you’re young
and you’re looking togmake a
change, you become the sys-
tem.” ' ‘

Since joining I the force,
-Delaney said one of his hardest
‘tasks has been keeping the Pitt
police up to date with the day’s
problems.

It’s a challenge he’s particu-
larly prepared-to meet.

“I’ve always been open-

' minded to new trends, and [I- I
, haven’_t] been afraid totryp new‘
things,” said Delaney. “That

mental approach helps.”

‘ I’m_ the -chief of -police,
’ » DelaneyL‘7‘iI7rm very open”,

He said he once tried to in-
troduce Segway scooters into
the force and then decided
against it. Instead, he intro-
duced bicycles.

Delaney said the Pitt police
were skeptical about the bikes
because it rains frequently
in Pittsburgh, but he took the
chance.

.He took a bicycle from the
lost and found, painted it white
and assigned an ofﬁcer to it.

“[The law] encourages free-
dom of thought and freedom of
speech, and there’s no reason
why I shouldn’t do the same,”
said Delaney.

The demands of Delaney’s
job occasionally change dra-

The Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill is open 24 hours a day, for when you
just can't wait until sunrise for your groceries.

by Eli Dile
Staﬂ W/riter

The eclectic neighborhood
of Squirrel Hill is a perfect
place for students to eat, shop
and explore without having to
go far from campus.

Ever since the immigration

boom of the early 20th century, .

Squirrel Hill has been home to
a large Jewish community.

Visitors will quickly‘ re-
alize this once they see the
many synagogues and au-
thentic delis throughout the
neighborhood. Many students
who want to live off campus
choose to make Squirrel Hill
their home. /

Students can take the 59U
or any of the 61 Port Author-
ity buses on Forbes Avenue
to Murray Avenue, the“ main
artery .of Squirrel Hill, in just
about 10 minutes.

For those who grow tired of
Pitt’s dining halls, the Squirrel
Hill Giant Eagle is the closest
grocery store to campus. Sev-
eral srnaller, ethnic grocery
storesdot either side of Mur-

ray Avenue as well.

Squirrel Hill’s two movie
theaters draw students to the
neighborhood. .

The Squirrel -Hill Theatre,
located on Forward Avenue,
typically plays the standard
Hollywood fare, while the
Manor Theatre offers more
independent and lesser—known
films. 1

There are a number of fine
restaurants featuring domestic
and international cuisine, in-
cluding Chinese, Middle East-
ern, Thai and pan-Asian.

Gullifty’s, which showcases
live jazz every Wednesday and
Friday night, is a neighbor-
hood favorite, voted the best
dessert in Pittsburgh several
years running. _

Dozen is another must for
those wishing’ to satisfy their
sweet teeth. This small bou-
tique bakes its own gourmet
cupcakes with ﬂavors ranging
from milk chocolate to Diva
Delicious Red Velvet.

Squirrel Hill is Pittsburgh’s
place for pizza. Located on

Murray Avenue are Aiello’s,

Napoli and Mineo’s, which is
regarded by "many as the baker
of Pittsburgh’s finest pie.

Bowlers will be surprised
by the number of lanes avail-
able in the practically hidden
Forward Lanes, a bowling al-
ley located on the upper ﬂoor
of a building not far from the
intersection of Murray and
Forward avenues.

A Clothing shoppers have a
number of different options to
look forward to when visiting
Squirrel Hill. Cheryl W. sells a
variety of clothes, jewelry and
purses.

For men wishing to class up
their wardrobe, there’s London
Dock, which is a bit on the ex-
pensive side. For bargain hunt-
ers there’s,Avalon Exchange, a
consignment shop that’s full
of surprises.

' In October, Avalon stocks
up on all kinds of kooky Hal-
loween supplies, so when it’s
time to buy a costume, stu-

dents should make a point to
‘see what it has to offer.

pavement, weary shoppers can

Has life in Oakland left you
in retail withdrawal? If the idea
of trying your luck at catching
a 59U to the Waterfront seems
too daunting or time-consum-
ing, Walnut Street can certain-
ly fulﬁll your craving. ‘

Set amid a combination of
college student-ridden apart-
ment complexes and mansions

alike, Walnut Street is the main ,

avenue of Shadyside.

Just a bus ride or a half-hour ‘

walk down Fifth Avenue, and
picturesque Shadyside will be
upon you.

Walnut Street is the home of
stores like J Crew, Banana Re-
public, Gap, Coach, Sephora
and White House/Black Mar-
ket, among other boutiques
and shops.

Just the slightest bit of sun-
shine guarantees an eclectic

mix of families and college
students roaming the street in
search of a good deal or a side-
walk seat at one of the street’s
many eateries.

For Thai food there is Thai
Place, China Palace forChi—

’ nese, Sushi Too for Japanese

and several delis and cafes for
classic American cuisine.

But if it’s not food you’re
looking for, Shadyside’s night-

priced mojito or a $5 pitcher.
Some college favorites on or
around Walnut Street include

Shadyside  

Cappy’s Cafe, Shady Grove
and William Penn Tavern. All

‘ of these places also offer food.

But if a more club-like scene
is the desired destination for a
night out, Alto Lounge is the
place to be, though the drinks
are often pricier. I L

For those willing to wan-
der a few blocks off the beaten
path, Ellsworth Avenue also
offers a plethora of restaurants,
bars, coffee shops and shop’-
ping.

And if money is tight, but

lege students — ‘many from -you’re still looking for enter-
tainment outside of Oakland,‘

just sit back and take in all that
is Shadyside.

A stroll through the neigh— .

borhood, no matter the season,
provides for a people—watch—
ing, mansion-scanning day.

To get to Shadyside from
Oakland, take a 500, 71A, 71C
or 71D bus and get off at South
Aiken Avenue.

Hung 1' with the I same nos-
talgia deserving of ‘a pair

of boxing gloves worn in a

championship bout, a pair of
old raggedy dress shoes —

their solesworn through like 9

those of a hobo — grace the
wall above city councilman
Patrick Dowd’s desk.‘

Their leather -deeply
scuffed and creased irrepa-
rably, the shoes are material
evidence of Dowd’s unlikely
ascension to his new post
where he represents District

97 in the city legislature. 1

During his campaign for

the school board in 2003,,

which chastened his later
run for council, the virtu-
ally unknown Dowd relied
on the oldest strategy in the
election playbook: walking

door to door through Law- ,

renceville, Highland Park
and Spring Hill_and asking
voters directly for their sup-
port. Dowd alone canvassed
3,000 homes in little more
than three months, and the
shoes look the part. 4

“That’s what I do. I knock

on doors,” said Dowd.
_I_t pai_d_'off.’Th‘ou,gh "he lost
the Democratic N Party en-

dorsement 83-4, which nor-'

mally assures its bearer a win,
Dowd beat both the endorsed
Democratic party incumbent
and the endorsed Republi-
can ‘candidate by about 300
votes, an incredible upset in
an election that only includes
around 3,000 ballots.

A Post-Gazette cartoon-

ist was so mystified by the

outcome that he portrayed
Dowd’s win with a takeoff on
the Dewey Defeats Truman
newspaper‘ headlines‘ fol-
lowing the 1948 presidential
election. ‘ A

As if to let the public know
that-it wasn’t all a dream,
Dowd piloted an even more
daring come-from-behind
campaign to unseat incum-
bent Len Bodack, D-District
7, from his city council seat

-last fall. Bodack came from

a political family and had the
strong backing of the Demo-
cratic Party.

But again, Dowd buckled

turned the tide.

But that would be a far cry
from the truth. The fact is that

ployed as a teacher just last.

fall, and he would have been
happy to retain thatposition
if he had lost the election.
Politics never happened
to be part of Dowd’s aspira-
tions. Rather, politics seemed
to have happened to him.
And on top of that, even if
his future did lie in politics,

the insider nature of Pitts-I

burgh»’s machine would be a
rebuff to most outsiders like
Dowd,‘ a native of Missouri.
But then again, Pitts-
burgh happened to Dowd,
also. , ' ‘ ‘
, Like so many young steel
city transplants, Dowd had no
plans of staying here ‘when he

arrived to do graduate work‘

at Pitt in the fall of 1991. ‘

_ “I figured I would get my
degree and leave,” he ‘said. “I

age [of it].”
That image of steel and

3.’-soot changed upon his first

arrival.

The summer after gradu-
ating with his bachelor’s de-
gree in history, Dowd drove
to Pittsburgh for’ an interview
with Pitt’s history depart-

ment. It was his first trip to

Pittsburgh.

“I came up the backside of
whatil now know as Mount
Washington, and it was this
beautiful, beautiful May
night. And I had to stop and
get out, and I was standing at
what I now know as the over-
look at Mount Washington,
and I was saying to people,
‘Is this’ Pittsburgh?”’ said
Dowd, recalling his amaze-
mentvat the city’s nightscape.

Dowd didn’t know it then,
but this was the first moment
in a series that would suture
him to his adopted city.

Looking back on his. years
at Pitt, Dowd is certain of
one thing: He neverhad the

‘slightest idea he would end

up in politics.
Though he had only taught
at private schools, his inter-

est in Pittsburgh’s 9 public _

education system grew as his"
,4 children — he now had six —

entered theclassroom one by
one.

“The public school system
was the critical thing. If pub-
lic education wasn’t good in
Pittsburgh, by our standards,
then we were leaving. There
was no way we would be
able to afford tuition at Win-

chester [-Thurston] or Ellis,”

said Dowd.

Dowd had kept up on city
news all through grad school,
and now in the classroom, he
frequently peppered his lec-
tures with rants about state
and local politics, especially
as it pertained to education.

“On a lark,” he decided
to run for the 24th Pennsyl-
vania State House seat. He

4 wasn’t overly serious, admit-
‘ ting that his students sort of

pushed him into it, but he did
the legwork regardless. He
knocked on doors and, to his
surprise, found many, people
as excited about education as
he. And he began to hear the
same refrain.

“They would say, ‘you

should run for school board,’”

said Dowd. .

After working for Pitt’s Tele-

serving as an ofﬁcer for Engi-
neering Student Council and
later as SGB member in 2007,
Link decided to run for presi-
dent.

The engineering—major-

Columbia, S.C., won students
over with a priority of getting a
fall break for Pitt students. He
said the initiative is possible for
the fall but unlikely to be sched-
uled until following calendar
years. ,

“Compared to other schools,
Pitt has a much longer summer
break than other schools,” said
Link. “However, we get a day
off on Labor Day, and the next

_ _ break isn’t for nearly another

three months.”

As an out-of-state student,
he said it was difﬁcult for him
to go home before Thanksgiv-
ing break. Although only a
slight majority of an online poll
of 3,500 students favored fall
break, Link said the .number

Clubs: all that and a bag of Brazil Nuts

by Estelle Tran
A4./iatzznt New E2)[tor

At the University of Pittsburgh’s
Activities Fair Sunday, Aug. 24, stu-
dents might expect to see hundreds

of student organizations ranging.

from the 4—square club to the Brazil
Nuts Portuguese club.

Pitt’s approximately 350 student
groups bring together students with
common academic interests, politi-
cal views, athletic abilities and pret-
ty much any other similarities you
might think of.

Some of Pitt’s most popular stu- .

dent organizations are Black Action
Society, Asian Student Association,

a Rainbow Alliance, Hillel Jewish

University Center, Campus Wom-

en’s Organization, Co11ege.Demo- _

crats and College Republicans.
New to the list of student organi-

zations are Cricket at Pitt, the Gael-

ic Athletics Club,_ History Club,

Persian Panthers and Humans vs. a

Zombies.
Humans vs. Zombies is a ‘cam-
pus—wide game of tag with a zombie

theme. Participants are identiﬁed by
bandanas on their arms if they are
humans andon their heads if they
become zombies. ‘Shane Price, the
vice president of HVZ, said that
anyone who enjoys shooting with
Nerf guns or foam noodles can
play. . y

“I think one of the things is that
when_you reach college, you try to
reach your inner child again,” said
Price. “It’s pretty much like back in
grade school. It’s  tag but it takes
two weeks to play it.”

In addition to HVZ, Pitt has
many other recreational clubs.
Many of Pitt’s student groups give
student athletes the opportunity to
play the sports they love without the
pressures of NCAA—level competi-

tion. However there are a few cases .

in which clubs are the only option
for athletes at Pitt. A

Pitt’s club tennis team is an ex-
ample of one such club. The club
tennis team is the only option at
Pitt for men. The University has a
women’s team, and the 25-member

North Side    

Co/ztriﬁuting E9itor

Perhaps no other neighborhood
in Pittsburgh offers more variety in
entertainment than the North Side.
Located north (surprise, surprise)
of the Allegheny and Ohio rivers,

this residential and ‘commercial

area is a scintillating smorgasbord
of science, art, history and birds.

‘ Originally an independent city
known as Allegheny City, the North
Side was annexed to Pittsburgh
in l9()’7. Cultmally diverse, it was
founded by immigrants from Brit-
ain, Germany, Croatia, the Czech

  

Republic and a laundry list of other
countries. Remnants of this unique
mixofculturestillremainsandis
reﬂected in residential areas like the
British—founded Manchester and
Gennan—populated Allegheny Fast,
also known as Deutschtown.
Arguably the best known of
these historic neighborhoods is the
Mexican War Streets. Filled with
beautiful architecture and nation-
ally renowned gardens, the area
was laid out by former Allegheny
City mayor, William Robinson Jr.,
who named each street after battles

The commercial area of the
North Side offers something for
just about everyone: the sports fa-
natic, the nature lover, the science
butf and the art critic, alike.

For those who can’t get enough

of the black and gold, the North

Side is a veritable sports heaven.

‘ Mark Nordenberg

by Katelyn Polantz
E3itor in Chef

The massive, wooden door
swings open to reveal the long, dark
room tricked into a corner of the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning.

There are wrought-iron chande-

, liers, an enormous stone ﬁreplace

and bookcases along the walls that

' stretchtotheceiling.

This is the oﬂice of the chancel-
lor at the University of Pittsburgh,
where Mark A. Nordenberg has

conducted his meetings for the past '

13 years.

As he walks around the room,
Nordenberg, with his wide, boyish
smile and carefully parted gray hair
capping off the traditional navy suit
and blue—and—gold tie, ‘points out
the moments caught on ﬁlm now
framed and ﬁlling the bookcases’
shelves.

“This is one of my favorite pho-
tographs,” he says, pointing to a
photo of Nkemjika Ofodile, Pitt’s
Homecoming queen in 2002, em-
bracing Nordenberg on Heinz Field
withherarmsfullofrosesandatiara
on her head “They said when they
armounced she won, she hugged
me so hard she picked me up off the
ground.”

-Through the years, Nordenbeg
has celebrated with students, hired

new faculty, resuscitated the athletic
department and pushed Pitt into
the top numbers for rankings and

~ﬁnances among universities across

the country, all while keeping the
tradition of Panther pride alive.

Just as Ojodile’s reaction at the
Homecoming football game was
unexpected, so has been Norden-
berg’s career path. \V1th initial plans
to practice law overcome by his de-
sire to teach, his rise up the ladder
into the top administrative position
of chancellor was swift and un-
plarmed Nordenberg never stayed
more than a few years with one title
at Pitt, jumping ﬁorn professor to as-
sistant dean to provost before land-
ing the title of chancellor more than
a decade ago.

“A lot of my life has been a mat-
ter of chance,” he said “I never had
ambitions to be a college or univer-
sity president.”

Nordenberg moved to Pitts-
burgh from Minnesota his senior
year of high school when U.S. Steel
brought the Nordenbergs to the area
until they moved to Chicago four
years later

lnsteadofleaving Pittsburgh with
his family, Nordenberg stayed in the
area and attended Thiel College, a
small, private school in Meadville,
Pa. There, he ran on the cross coun-

Panther Card not

by Jordan Fremuth
Staﬂ Wrder

It tells you what you’re eat-
ing. It gets you around the city.
It tells you how much money
you have. It gets you home. In
short, it holds just about ev-
erything you need as a college
student at Pitt. What’s better?
It fits in your pocket. What is
it? Why, it’s the Panther Card,
your Pitt ID, of course.

Your Pitt ID is in many
ways the key to your college
experience at the University of
Pittsburgh.

For many of the residence
halls on campus, it’s your way

just a room key   P

in. You use your Pitt ID both to

' swipe into the residence hall as

well as getting into your own
room. _.

’_ It also houses a great deal of
vital information necessary for
a successful year at college.
Perhaps most importantly, it’s
your way to eatlat such popular
campus eateries. as the Cathe-
dral Cafe and Market'Centra1.

The Cathedral Cafe _is a
dining facility located on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral

of Learning. Market Central is‘

ity located within the Towers

complex. Both of these offer a

Next was the University of Ms-
consin Law School. In his ﬁnal year,
heservedabriefstintasaNavy
JAG officer and then practiced law

» for two years in Minnesota.

Capital University in Columbus,
Ohio, gave him his ﬁrst teaching
position in 1975. Two years later,
the faculty of Pitt’s law school wel-
comed Nordenberg as an assistant
professor.

“'Ihe only thing I’ll say without
false modesty thatl was really good
at was teaching,” he said.

Teaching awards sit on the upper
levels of the bookshelves in the of-
ﬁce and support his claim.

“Mark was a fabulous teacher,
he really was. The students loved
him,” said Barry McCarthy, a pro
fessor at the law school whose ten-
ure predates Nordenberg’s. When
Nordenberg ﬁrst came to Pitt, Mc-
Carthy and he were close personal
friends as well as colleagues, hold-

ing season tickets to the Pirates and ‘

attending the World Series together
in 1979.

“He still looks boyish, but
back then, the students called him
‘Sparky,’ a real term of affection,”
said McCarthy. “He always got a
huge emollment in his class.”

In 1985," the year Nordenberg
received the Chancellor’s teaching
award, he became associate dean of
the law school, before his promotion
to dean two years later.

The beauty of attending an
urban university is that there
is always something to do
and somewhere else to go for
a change of scenery. Though
Pitt boasts the city’s name in
its title, there are several other
universities in the ’Burgh, all
worthy of "exploration.

Here are a few within or
just outside of Pitt’s Oakland
neighborhood: ‘

Every year it seems that
more students move beyond
Oakland. _

They voluntarily rely on Port
Authority buses for their daily

commutes, forfeit the assurance ,

that they will live no more than
100 feet from the nearest party
and make anything on campus
a general inconvenience.

Yet living outside Oakland
might be worth it to those look-
ing to reside in one of Pitts-
burgh’s many other culturally
resplendent neighborhoods.

Three of the most popular
places for Pitt students to live
and visit are Bloomﬁeld, Law-
renceville and Garﬁeld, all
known as long—standing ethnic

enclaves and new—blooming ar-

tistic havens.

coed group must compete with Pitt
women’s temris for players.

President of Pitt’s club tennis
team, Pat Sweny, said that it’s a
little problematic holding practice
because Pitt doesn’t have tennis
courts. The club practices three
times a week at Monroeville’s Club
4 Life. A

“I bet most people at Pitt don’t
know we have a club team since we
don’t have courts on campus. Most
of the schools we compete against
have courts because interest in ten-
nis is so prevalent,” said Sweny,

Despite the obstacle of Pitt not
having tennis courts, the dedicated
members of the temiis club gave
Pitt the best showing ever of any
rookie team at last year’s sectionals
at Lehigh University, placing sixth
out of 20 teams. '

A few of Pitt’s other recreational
clubs are the Badminton Club, Pan-
ther Paintball Club and Hooligans
Soccer Club.

Some other Pitt organizations
focus on advocacy. Among these

groups are Facilitating Opportu-

nities for Refugee Growth and

Empowerment, Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur and Amnesty
Intemational. ’

Amnesty Intemational members
often petition politicians about hot-
button issues, but the group is also
known for holding the Jarrmesty
concert and movie screenings, said
President Alexandra Schrnittlein.
The group works to release people
who’ve been imprisoned for their
beliefs, race,. religion, etc.

‘‘This makes people feel like
they’re a part of something. Obvi-
ously, one person doing something
won’t make a lot of difference, but
we write letters to authority ﬁgures
and petition. That’s what matters,”

! said Schrnittlein.

Complementing the advocacy
groups are the service groups. Pitt
has 32 services groups. Many of
these are local chapters of national
campaigns, such as One, Engineers
for a Sustainable World, Red Cross
and the environmental ’ group Free

team

the Planet.
Pitt also has 22_religious student
organizations " including Comer-

stone Christian Ministry, Chabad’

House and Some of God’s Children
Gospel Choir. .

Most groups receive at least
some funding from the Student

Government Board, which allo-

cates about $2.4 million to Student
Organization Resource Center,‘ or
SORC, groups. SGB receives that
budget ﬁom the student activities
fee all students pay with their tuition
bills. I .

SORC employee Natalie
Swabb said the only requirements
to form a student organization are
10 members, a full-time faculty ad-
viser, a president, a vice president,
a business manager and a constitu-

tion; , _ _
For those unsatisﬁed with the selec- ‘

tion of clubs at Pitt, the requisites
for new student groups are not de-

. manding. As a result there are new

organizations fonning at Pitt every

Foridessert, students may create
their own ice cream at Cold Stone
Creamery by choosing ﬂavors and
toppings and watching the employ-
ees mash them together behind the

Throughout the upcoming sum-
mer months, the Waterﬁont will
host additional special events that
are open to the public. On Thurs-
day, May 15 from Bob Allen from
the Dale Carnegie System will

If you need something to satisfy your
sweet tooth, stop by Fort Pitt Candy, Mon
Aimee Chocolat, Fudgie Wudgie Fudge
and Chocolate Factory or Klavon’s Ice
Cream Parlor and indulge in some sugary
goodness. T

In addition to delicious food avail-

able on everycomer, the Strip District’s

many artisans and craftsmen add an un-

deniable element of eccentricity to the
neighborhood. Streetside stands offer you .
everything from abstract oil paintings and

black—and—white photographs to Steelers

1- jerseys in trademark black and gold.

Vendors selling ﬂowers, kettle—cooked
popcorn and kebabs lend a bohemian at-
mosphere to the Strip, and it’s a feeling
you won’t ﬁnd anywhere else in Pitts-
burgh.

But come to the Strip after dark, and
you will ﬁnd it to be a completely differ-
ent place —— in a good way. The bars and
nightclubs that go unnoticed during the

a major destination for party-goers and-

revelers.

DejaVu Lounge offers an extensive A

drink menu and is known for its laid—back
atmosphere. Firehouse Lounge has quick-
ly sought to establish itself as one of "Pitts-

"' burgh’s most elegant and classy bars, and

with its candlelit and antique tables sur-
rounded by modern art, it has succeeded.
Mu1laney’s Harp and Fiddle brings a little
bit of Ireland to the Strip, and live bands
offer the perfect complement to that pint
of Guinness. V

Privilege has also become one of Pitts-
burgh’s hottest nightclubs, and its swanky,
minimalist decor creates one of the city’s
most unique atmospheres. Pure is also
an exciting and upscale club at which to
spend a Friday or Saturday night. C

To experience all the fun and energy
that the Strip has to offer, hop on the 54C

time. ,

Two. years ‘ago, Student
Life started several commuter
student programs to help com-
muters feel more connected to
Pitt: On the ground ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union,» Student
Life created a new lounge for

commuters to study, relax and

socialize.

Another campus organiza-

tion,‘ Student Volunteer Out-

reach, stresses the importance
of civil responsibility and en- _

gagement, Bonner said.

With programs like Jump-
start Pittsburgh and America
Reads Challenge, Bonner be-

lieves students can use these

experiences to understand how
they can directly affect and
inﬂuence the community as

individuals. SVO also spon—,

sors_ alternative spring breaks
at service sites across America
to allow students to ‘work on a

Pitt-S Activities   Fair 

week-long service project and

reﬂect on their experience, he
said.» ' -

Besides working with ‘stu-
dent organizations, y Bonner
plans to make more“ oppor-

tunities available to students

through better utilization of

technology on campus. Student ‘
. Life is currently working onthe

installation -of ‘digital displays
in the lobby of the Union to dis-
play upcoming events, he said.
Bonner also works to main-
tain the Union’s facilities and
said he hopes ‘that by continu-

-ing to improve thfe,,;._,,building,

more students will come there
to socialize. Student Life is
looking to.create an area on-the
ﬁfth ﬂoor for students to hang
out, he said. i '

If incoming freshmen want
to get involved on campus but
do not know. how or where
to start, Bonner advised that

they attend the Activities Fair,
scheduled for August 24 during
New Student Orientation, to get
a feel for-the kinds of organiza-
tions offered at Pitt;

After going to the Activi-
ties Fair, freshmen should try to
narrow down their interests and
attend some of the organiza-
tions’ meetings and events with
friends to see how the groups
operate, he said.

While Bonner believes it is
important for freshmen to iden-
tify whatthey are comfortable
doing, he also suggested that

' students try something new and

different to. explore new inter-
ests. A A .

No matter what students
choose to pursue, however,
Bonner acknowledged that all
students have a better experi-
ence at Pitt and possess lasting
relationships with other , stu-
dents after they graduate if they

are involved on campus.

Campus engagement helps: '

students learn to manage their
lives and employment oppor-

‘ tunities, Bonner said. Students

can take advantage of these
out-of—classroom experiences
to network and discover avail-
able resources on campus.
“Involvement
propriate level also helps with
overall retention in school,”
said Bonner. “Many of the stu-

-dent leaders are doing well aca-

demically.”

Most importantly, Bonner,‘

said student organizations help

‘prepare students for life after.

ing for people with experience

Delaney
looks out
for Pitt  

Delaney, page 18

ney. often introduces himself to recruits
and their parents while they’re touring
Pitt.

“That little touch that I like to call
‘Pittsburgh? goes back [with them],”
said Delaney. '

He also takes the opportunity to lec-
ture students on the emergency notiﬁca-
tion system. Students, hesaid, should be
sure totsign up, and they should list their
parents as their third contact number.

“I "don’t think any of the students
wanted me to do that,” he said.

“They’re your parents. But when

people [are] in California and some- .

thing happened in Pittsburgh, they want
to know what’s going on.”

Delaney said he also uses the depart-
ment’s .Web site to keep in touch with
the University community.

He said he can’t tell who is looking at

_ the Web site, but he does know that, on
. average, more than 900 foreigners visit

the site every month._

“You may not be able to see me or
ﬁnd me, but you’re still in contact with
me?’ said Delaney.

Delaney said his job gives him the ,

opportunity to meet all sorts of people,
including celebrities.
He’s met politicians Hillary Clinton,

. Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama and

actors Bill Cosby and Mickey Rooney.

He’s also met a prime minister of P0-
land inthe 1970s. P

Delaney said the diplomat and his
family were touring the Nationality
Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning
when he realized the couple’s teenaged
daughter was missing.

One woman from Pittsburgh found
the girl and was trying to talk to her, but
the prime minister’s security was so re-
strictive that they held herback.

After .a few minutes, the security‘ 0‘

guards realized the woman was speak-
ing Polish to the girl. She was just try-
ing to help. . ‘

Delaney called the incident “ironic”
and “kind of ﬁtting”and said that inci-
dents like that keep him fresh. V

“Something’s always happening
here, always,” said Delaney.

“That’s what keeps me young. You
can’t get stale in. this environment.”

One word: outlets. Lots of outlets. It 

is the exact opposite of Posvar Hall in
terms of outlets.

This is good news for students us-
ing their own laptops — Wireless Pitt-

Net connects here -— and there’s tons of 3

space to spread out with modular fumi-
ture, comfortable couches and chairs and
long tables. ,

The lounge also branches over into
cubicles‘ — the ultimate in distraction
elimination — and a windowed, open
meeting area for when the idea of spend-
ing all day in ‘a basement computer lab
makes your soul cry.

As with any study space that isn’t a
bug—free, temperature-controlled deserted
island, the ﬁfth ﬂoor has itsdrawbacks.

For one, a reliable person to watch
your belongings while you take a break
is not always available.

But more than this, as "the headquarters .

of a number of student organizations, the

ﬁfth ﬂoor leaves one vulnerable to noise A

ambush.

There is no way to know who (as in ‘

what organization, sorority, step group,
etc.) is meeting there and when.

Few things are sadder than setting up 
A shop, getting comfortable and cracking 
open a diet soda only to be chased out 
mere seconds later by a sorority bridal 
shower taking place in the common. 
room. Study—wise, there’s no coming 

back from that.

The Cathedral Commons

Why? Because it’s just like a church 
without all that distracting stained glass 
or preaching. The imposing pillars and 3;
weighty Beowulf chairs give the Cathe- 
dral commons room an ambiance condu- 

cive to diligent working.

It’s quiet, there’s a lot of desk space 
and always a previously unknown nook_ 

or cranny for the ﬁnding.

The Cathedral is best, however, for .3
paperwork, as outlets are hard to come by 
during peak hours. Also, the low lighting i
is straight-up depressing during spring ﬁ— f
nals when the rest of Oakland is sunshine S ;_,
and tank tops and bunnies and rainbows. 4

on drinking, there are several steps
they can take to minimize the chances

emphasizes the importance of knowing

‘personal limits before drinking.

It also advises staying around close
friends while drinking. V

“Research shows that more than
70,000 students between the ages of 18

S and 24 are victims of sexual assault or

date rape each year,” according to the

Web site. .

“Over 50 percent of all sexual as-
sault cases involve alcohol consump-
tion by the perpetrator, victim or both.

To prevent sexual violence, avoid be-"

ing alone with another personif you’ve .

been drinking, be aware of your sur-

roundings and avoid empty hallways or-
isolated parts of bars and houses where‘

someone could easily pull you into a
bedroom or closet.”

But these rules don’t just apply
when you’re under the inﬂuence. The
Arlington Virginia ‘Police Department
told reporters at nbc4.com that people
should stay in well-lit areas, and they
should avoid traveling alone. ‘

Students may call 412-648-2255 to ‘

request a shuttle ride. To use the ser-

vice, studentswill need their Panther

Students may bring one guest with 

them on SafeRider, but they must tell
the operator how many passengers are
accompanying them when they call to
request a shuttle. S

Pitt also offers a number of self- ff;
- defense classes. The University offers A

personal defense, a class that “offers
physical conditioning and self-defense
through the application of Judo,” ac-

S cording to its course description.

Bennett said the University also of-

fers a course called “Buy yourself a ‘Ti

9

minute,’ which-teaches students how
to gain extra time while they’re try-
ing to fend off attackers. However, the
course couldn’t be found in the course
catalog.

Additionally, the Pitt police offer a ‘

self—defense awareness and familiariza-
tion exchange program and a rape ag-

gression defense course at no charge to 

students.

Interested students -may call the Pitt 
police. Bennett said they will generally ‘
run a course if they have a minimum of A

six people interested in it.
No amount of training will prepare
people if they’re not on their guard.

Bennett said students must trust their ~

instincts. V
“If something doesn’t seem right,”
he said, “it probably isn’t.”

ed at the conﬂuence of three rivers: the

Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio.

When viewed from above, they form
what has been aptly dubbed the Golden
Triangle.

At the tip of this triangle is Point
State Park. At the point,-a student can
stroll along the river walks, enjoy wa-
ter sports — boats and jet skis are con-
stantly zipping down the rivers during
summer months —— or just soak up the

sun in the newly renovated Point State
Park. The multi-million—do1lar project
is expected to be completed this sum-
mer.

Still haven’t touched on anything that
tickles your particular fancy? Why not
take a trip to the city’s cultural district,
located on Penn Avenue Downtown?

From the Civic Light Opera to off-
Broadway productions to 1ong—running
plays and musicals to concerts and op-

eras —— many of which offer a discount

to students — the Cultural District has
something to offer anyone and everyone
that is interested-in the ﬁne arts.

Finally, Downtown plays home to
many of the city’s most popular and
well-attended annual events.

One of these events is the Pittsburgh
Arts Festival, where local artists, musi-
cians and artisans meet to show and sell
their wares in the summer.

lines aren’t particularly long at Five Guys, this
establishment allows you to call your order in
advance to eliminate wait times.

Like happy hour at the local bar, a number
of Oakland’s restaurants olfer half—ofI" specials
on a portion of their menus to keep the tables
full as the night wears on.

Joe Mama’s, on the comer of Forbes and
Oakland, is one of these, and from 11 p.rr1. to
midnight, certain items from its Italian menu
are half-price. Joe Mama’s has been in Oakland
for a while, and its staying power is a result of
the great Italian food it continues to serve to

Oakland’s population. Unknown to many, Joe _

Mama’s also offers a solid breakfast menu.
Next to Joe Marr1a’s on Oakland Avenue is

_ Fuel and Fuddle. Like Joe Mama’s, it operates

a half—olf menu every night after 11. Fuel and
Fuddle describes its cuisine as “wildﬁre food,”

I which translates into burgers, pizza and a num-

ber of other items. Fuel serves brunch from 11
am. to 2 pm. every Sunday. ' V
I Atwood, previously mentioned for its two

A pizzerias, is also home to two Mexican restau-

rants. La Fiesta and Mad Mexare both located
on Atwood and each operates late-night spe-
cials. _

Another Oakland restaurant that olfers late-

Cheap eats on orbes

night specials, India Garden serves authentic
Indian food that you really can’t get on your Pitt
meal plan. -

If you’re willing to venture away ﬁom the

heart of Oakland in search of good food, it‘

would be worth walldng down to Craig Street
Still a part of Oakland but closer to Carnegie
Mellon than Pitt, Craig Street is home to a num-
ber of restaurants including some of the best
Asian restaurants in town.

LuLu’s Noodles is a popular pan—Asian res-
taurant on Craig Street that specializes in, obvi-
ously, noodle dishes.

Of course, if you’re looking for traditional
‘rice dishes, Little Asia is just up the street ﬁom

' LuLu’s on Craig. Little Asia serves Asian rice

and noodle dishes as well as a variety of sushi.

Ifyou walk down Forbes past Craig Street,
you will also ﬁnd Orient Express. No one is left
out by Orient Express ’s menu, which olfers
noodle and rice dishes with meat and vegetar-
ian options. The prices are easy on the average
college student’s budget, too.

As you will see, Oakland has something for

everybody when it comes to food From wild- S

ﬁre food to Indian and everything in between,
sampling what foods Oakland has to offer is an
education in and of itself.

ing. Why read about the physics when you
can experience its effects ﬁrst—hand? The Sci-
ence Center also boasts a four—story theater,
known as the Omnimax, where museum—go-
ers can become visually immersed in topics as
diverse as the deep sea and outer space. See,
learning really can be fun.

But wait, there ’s more! If the Science Cen-
ter didn’t satisfy your cravings for knowledge
and discovery, why not take a trip to the near-
by Allegheny Observatory? This astronomical
research institution and historical landmark is
more a center of ongoing research than a tour-
ist attraction. However, it is available to Uni-
versity students, and some professors even
hold their classes  the building. But if
research and classes aren’t your thing, you
can learn and proﬁt ﬁom the work of others
instead by taking a tour of the observatory
(open from April until October).

For those with a ﬂare for the artistic, the
North Side has several greatart museums, in-
cluding The Andy Warhol Museum, devoted
to its namesake, a Pittsburgh—native and con-
troversial artist of the 60s, 70s and 80s, and the

Mattress Factory  Museum, a contempo-'

rary art museum with a focus on interactivity.
For those looking to create art themselves, the
Manchester Craftrnen’s Guild is a multi-disci-
plined arts and learning center that focuses on
anything from ceramics, visual art and pho-
tography to performing arts and jazz music.
But conceivably the most delicious of
North Side attractions is the National Aviary.
Housing more than 600 individual birds, it is

' the nation’s only independent indoor nonprof-

it aviary and also the nation’s largest aviary.
It houses more than 200 separate species of
birds, many of which are threatened or endan-
gered_ Visitors can enjoy various programs
sponsored by the aviary, including trainer

_talks, bird presentations, and feedings.

To gain access to all these magical places
and more, simply board a 500-line Port Au-
thority bus. Just be prepared to be enchanted
and amazed. The North Side is just that good

the fall and spring programs last for a full
semester, and the summer program spans 10
weeks. Students take classes onboard the ship
between port stops, and during their stops
they have the opportunity to take additional
ﬁeld trips and explore on their own. '
Although Pitt no longer sponsors the pro-
gram, there are still scholarships available to
help defray the costs to students. Tuition and
room and board for the program can reach
around $18,000, which can be a high price
for many students to pay, especially when
many of the side trips have additional costs as
well. Generally, about 40 percent of students

receive aid, and the program has more than
$2 million to grant.

Despite the cost, though, the Semester a
Sea program claims more than 45,000 peopl
as alumni on its Web site and 734 studen
cuirently taking the voyage. The minimu
GPA required to be eligible for the program
is 2.75, levying some exclusivity to the pro

such as the Red Star Tavern, Joe’s Crab Shack
and the Hard Rock Cafe.

In the heart of the Bessemer Court, there’s
the Waltzing Waters Liquid Fireworks Show.
To the tune of the “Macarena” and other up-
beat dance hits, hundreds of water jets create
a multicolored, swirling spectacle. On a bright
surnrner’s day, there’s sure to be kids nmning
around t_he fountain and dancing to the music.

Before leaving the Bessemer Court, make
sure to take in the view of the city. However,
there will be a giant black object in your way.
It’s a IO—ton Bessemer converter commemo-
rating Pittsburgh’s steel industry.

To continue the history lesson, you might
mosey on over to the Pittsburgh and Lake
Erie Freight House, which is now referred
to as the Freight House Shops. The restored
building houses quaint stores that sell soaps,
socks and fudge. For all of your Irish fashion
needs, there’s also St Brendan’s Crossing.
Hometowne Sports, also located in the Freight
House Shops, carries merchandise to support
Pittsburgh sports teams. I - I ' .

‘Popular restaurants" such as TAl"1e,Melt'—
“ing Pot, Sesame. Inn, Houlihan’s arid 

Japanese restaurant alsoreside  the Freight"

House. , - .
Next to the Frei t House food court re-
sides the portal for the Segway in Paradise
guided tours. A two-hour tour and training ses-
sion costs about $60, while a 45-minute ses-
sion costs about $25.

A short walk down West Carson Street from
the Freight House is the Monongahela Incline.
Take a free ride to the top with your Pitt ID and

enjoy what “USA Weekend” named the sec-

ond most beautiful View in America at Mount
Washington. ‘

With allthe PG—rated fun Station Square
has to olfer, one might forget about the attrac-
tions for the2l-and-older crowd. I
People who are looking to laugh away their
stresses are welcome to visit The Funny Bone
comedy club, located near the Bessemer Court.
Adjacent to The Furmy Bone is the Green

Room, a night spot where karaoke is ‘part of ’

the atmosphere.

Station Square is also home to numerous *

themed clubs, such as the Saddle Ridge cow-
boy bar, Margarita Mamas, Matrix nightclub
and the new Asian—inspirediclub Zen.

soon), Urban Outﬁtters and Forever 21.

On a budget? No problem. The Goodwill
store is right around the comer. It serves as one
of the most popular choices around Hallow-
een time when poor college students need to
ﬁnd a costume for literally under $10.

The South Side Works movie theater also
attracts many students, especially on $5 Mon-
day movie night. " '

So plan a day out with the grouprbrowsing,
eating and watching a movie or two. Just make
sure to get back to the bus stop before mid-
night or your carriage will turn into a pump-
kin. Actually, you’ll just miss the last bus back
to campus and end up calling Yellow Cab.

wide array of foods fo_r students, and all
you need to take advantage of them is
your ID. There is also an all—you—can-
eat dining facility in Sutherland Hall.
~Your ID keeps track of your meal

plan — a combination of dining passes,
Dining Dollars and Panther Funds. De-
pending upon which dining facility you
attend, you can use any of these three
options.

Michael Heaterl Photo Editor

Port Authority buses are always free with your Panther Card. This 54C outside of .
Alumni Hall is on its way from Oakland to the Strip District. A -

64

There are also several smaller con"-
venience—store—type locations, which
only accept Dining Dollars and Panther

‘Funds. So, if you’re ever feeling hun-

gry, it’s important to have that ‘Pitt ID
waiting in your pocket. S
Your ID can also double as a debit
card. Pitt, working with PNC Bank,
allows students to switch the banking
information from their PN C debit cards
over to their Pitt IDs. It works just like
a debit card_ but allows you to carry
around one less card. But with a deb-
it card masquerading as a Pitt ID, it’s
more important than ever to safeguard
your supercard. , .
For some students, Pitt IDs are most
valuable off campus. One of the ID’s
several features is that it grants you
access to many of the local museums,
such as the Carnegie Museum of Natu-
ral History and the Carnegie Museum

of Art. It is also your free ticket into '
the Mattress Factory, a museum of con— ’
temporary installation art in the North‘

Side. - R . V -P
With a flash of your Pitt ID, you can
visit the closest thing to Eden around

Pitt, Phipps Conservatory and Botani-

cal Gardens, free of charge.
History buffs can also get in the
Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Region-

_ al History Center and step into a 17903

n

log cabin or rediscover the west with
Lewis and Clark.

Not only can, your Pitt ID get you
into places for free, but it can also get
you there. - '

Pitt provides its students with free
public transportation into and around
the city. This might not sound like
much, but that $2 fare each way might
get a little tiresome. Not to- mention
almost everything you might need and
can’t find on campus is just a bus ride
away. I '

Students may also ride the “T,”’

Pittsburgh’s light—rail train system, to
such popular destinations as the South
Hills and Station Square. From Station
Square, students may ride the Monon-
gahela or Duquesne inclines to a glori-
ous view of Pittsburgh’s skyline.

Whether you’re on your way to the
airport or The Andy Warhol Museum,
be sure your Pitt ID is by your side.

- Humphrey is constantly trying to
ﬁnd ways to make student life more en-
« , , joyable. ?

Her most recent project is the trans-
formation’ of the Union’s ﬁfth ﬂoor into
a “stress—free zone.”

Though plans are still in their earli-
 "*= ,  est stages, Humphrey’s face lig-hts up as

she describes the virtual video games

and massage chairs she envisions stu-
dents getting the chance to use.

She calls herself a super—sized resi-’
dent’s assistant with the goal of devel-
oping community at Pitt.

Before coming to Pitt in 2005, ‘

Humphrey worked at Saint Louis Uni-
versity, the school where she received

her doctorate. .

.The biggest change, though she
stresses loving her students at both

_ schools, is Pitt’s commitment to its un-
dergraduates. , _

“,[Chancellor] Mark Nordenberg
loves students,” she said. “It makes my
job easy. I was always having to ﬁght
for students in the past.”

Now, when she has an ideaabout
how to improve student life, she said,
Pitt’s administration is almost always
receptive._

This probably has to do with the type
of students Pitt breeds, said Humphrey.

“Our students are so accepting and
so willing to engage and make a differ-

s ence,” she_said. , I

And it might go without saying, con—
sidering her role at the University, but
Humphrey’s advice for new students at
Pitt is to get involved immediately —
and to hit the books, because though it
might feel like it, it’s not high school ‘
any more. ' V ‘ _ ,

“Study from day one,” she said.

“And be good.”

as a landlord evaluation survey for off-
campus students and the panther statue
project, where members from the 2006-
07 board bought 10 ﬁberglass panther
statues for student organizations to paint
in preparation for Homecoming this fall.

But Link_ said the main project for
SGB this year was “Pitt Make a Differ-
ence Day,” when, hopefully, more than
2,000 students will do community ser-
vice around the Pittsburgh area — within
one day.

Currently, Link and the board mem-
bers are arranging different service sites
for Pitt students to go to on a Saturday in
October. That evening, participating stu-
dents will celebrate with entertainment
and activities.

Link said the focus will be Oakland,
but students will reach out to all parts of
the Pittsburgh. ,

“One thing Pitt claims is that the city
is your campus,” said Link. “We want to
give back to the city and have Pitt stu-
dents do community service.”

The involvement in the project would
reflect a change in attitude toward stu-
dent government". Link said that change
is one of his goals for his term, as well

as what he’d like to see SGB accomplish 

after he graduates in December.

“If you look at SGB, there has been
some disinterest and more apathy [within
the student body] toward SGB in recent
years. In the past two or three years, turn-

out has declined along with the number 

of students running,” said Link. “I really
want to see an increase in people voting
and running in elections. '

Link said he wanted students to per-
ceive SGB as more than just a “money-
giver” for students. 3

‘‘That’s only one aspect of what_ we
do,” he said. '

Link said the best part of his role is
meeting many people and seeing the di-
versity of the campus, which made up
for the “late nights and early mornings”
he spent working during his campaign.
He said he was in touch with students
through student organization meetings,
which showed the “vast dynamic” and
“diversity” at Pitt.

“We’ve got something for everybody,
and if we don’t have that, you can go cre-
ate it,” said Link. “There are all sorts of
different cultural and activity organiza-
tions on campus. Whatever students like
doing, you can ﬁnd an organization on
our campus.” '

Dowd lost the election,
but kept in touch with
many of the people he had
‘met while campaigning.

""' He ended up co-orga-
nizing a community ac-
tion group with the goal of
electing a progressive rep-
resentative to the school
board. The group coalesced
around November 2002 and
began formulating ideas
for public education in the

city.iBy January they need?

ed to find a candidate to
begin campaigning for the
iipcoming election in May.

At first, he wouldn’t
even consider it.

“I started off saying,
‘Look, I can’t do this. I
teach at a private. school.
It’ll be a loser campaign.” .

And beside his own
weaknesses, Dowd‘ was up

  
  

 

against the school board

president, a well—connected

Democrat named Darlene
Harris who would reunite
with Dowd on.city council.

But eventually he "gave
in and became the group’s
candidate. On a “freezing,

early January, 120 group
members convened‘ at the

Liberty and formally nomié
nated Dowd to run for Dis-

Nordy, page 50

“Morale on campus was low, and we were
ngt attracting the numbers we wanted as stu-
dents,” said Nordenberg about the l994—1995
school year.

To tackle the problems, he focused on
University. fundraising and building the en-
dowment, a saving that builds interest dollars
neoessary for today ’s private and semilprivate
universities to thrive. Pitt is technically a state-
afﬁliated university and only receives a small
portion of funding — about 11 percent of its
budget .— from the state.

 

Since Nordenberg came to ofﬁce, the
University’s endowment has ballooned from
$460 million as of June 31995 to almost $25
billion as of the same month last year, said Pitt
treasurer Amy Marsh.

Thanks to such resources, Pitt has ranked
for the second consecutive year as one of the
top seven research universities in the country,
the Pitt Chronicle reported in March. ‘

In 1997, Nordenberg launched the unprec-
edented $1 billion capital campaign for private
donations to the University. Last June, he an-

Where you

 

nounced the completion of that goal and set
the University’s sight on earning a total of $2
billion in the campaign.

Steve Pederson, now the athletic director,
had visited Pittin 1992, four years prior to
when he took the job, and was less than irn—
pressed by the status quo and community at-
titude, or lack thereof, on thecampus, he said.

He interviewed for athletic director a year
into Nordenberg’s administration, and after
that visit to the Oakland campus Pederson

said he told his wife, “This is a whole diﬂ°er-

    

brought a better Pitt

ent place. You would not recognize Pitt if you
came here now.”

Pederson still stands by his word.

‘The secret of a great coach is to get ev-
eryone playing together, and that’s what he’s
done,” he said.

But Nordenberg’s leadership of Pitt hasn’t
been completely without weaknesses.

One of Nordenberg’s main focuses has
been on strengthening Pitt’s athletics programs
and facilities, and the University came under
scrutiny last spring when the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette unearthed audit reports for building
the Petersen Events Center. The reports noted
that gross cost overruns, ﬂawed designs and
sub—par workmanship all marred the project.

“It was a state-managed project,” said
Clark. When asked if University adrr1ir1istra-
tion took any missteps with the project, Clark
responded, “No, none.” r

Now, the Pete is one of the trademark
buildings on campus, the ﬂagship of the ath-
letic department and one of the joint triumphs
of Nordenberg and Pederson.

This December, when Pitt men’s basket-
ball upset Duke at Madison Square Garden
with a 3-point shot at the buzzer, Pederson
and Nordenberg headed to the locker rooms to
speak to the team together.

Even in the excitement of the win, N orden-
berg stopped before he reached the team and
took Pederson to the athletic training room to
see ﬁeshly injured player Mike Cook, Peder-
son said. ,

“A lot of people would have been high-
ﬁving the ones who won,” he said.

Weaving the Pitt community into the fabric
of the surrounding city has‘ been a goal sinoe
N ordenberg came to Pitt.

Although occasional travel takes him out

' of the ofﬁce for scholarship presentations,
. alumni dinners and Pitt sporting events, Nor-

denberg dedicates 12-hour days to his job.

He said he comes into the ofﬁce at about
6:30 am. and leaves after 6 p.m. each day, of-
ten working seven days a week A

“It may not be until 7 or 8 o’clocl;, but we
still have dinner together every night,” said

The premise of this lounge is essen-
tially a living room parked in a cathedral.
Accordingly, it’s quiet, cozyand easy to
nap here.

Indiscriminately warm in all sea-
sons, the lounge and its comfortable fur-
niture are welcome respite in winter but
roasting in spring.

_ Luckily, the large fan stashed in
the comer for just such an issue creates
some excellent

ambient noise to study by, stirring up
the air into a soft whirr that scrambles
sounds and neutralizes distraction.

Hillman Library ‘

Hillman is great for “studying”
-— i.e. talking with friends, using the wire-
less Internet for unproductive pursuits and
maybe printing some assigned reading.

The reading rooms are use-
ful when it gets down to the wire: quiet,
comfortable and decorated so they don’t
pulse with the stark ﬂuorescent lighting of
prisons, hospitals and the ground ﬂoor of
Hillman. '

Still, it’s best not to let the word
“library” fool you — it doesn’t bear the
nickname “Club Hillman” for nothing.

Of course, there are excellent

‘places to study at Pitt beyond those listed

here — many of which those of us not en-
rolled in science courses can only dream
of — but the point is, don’t wait until the
last second to ﬁnd a spot. After all, your

Learn to Cope with disadvantages of comimuter life

by Elhanr Khatami A 5;; .

Fmancial limitations, a desire to
remain close to family, privacy or
overbearing parents — no matter
what the reason, living oﬁ" campus
and commuting to school is an option
that many students have to consider.

Irr many ways, commuting is
an advantageous option Students
are able to save money thatwould
otherwise be spent on rent or room
and board. Those who live at home
with family generally do not have to
wony about when or where to eat.
And studying and staying focused on
schoolwork is often much easier in
the comfort of one’s own home.

But commuting also has its dis-
advantages. Students ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to get involved in campus activities
or to attend parties late at night. Get-
tingupearlyinthemomingisamust
forthosewhoneedtocatchthebus
to campus. And, without roommates,

making ﬁiends can be a daunting ex-

perience.
As someone who has commuted

to and from campus for the majority of

 

ege career, I have experienced
these advantages and disadvantages
ﬁrsthand I’ve also learned that amid
the independent and sociable college
environment, commuting can force
you into a bubble where you will in-

. evitably ﬁnd yourself detached from

campus life. And unless you take the
initiative to do something about it,
your college experience is bound to
be rmpleasant.

Here are seven tips that will help
ease your commuting qualms:

1. Getacampus job.Acarnpus job
will not only allow you to make sorrre
money, but itwillenarre your involve-
ment and integration into the Univer-
sity atmosphere. During my ﬁeshrnan
year, I got a job as a student worker at
the Biomedical Science Tower where
I did simple clerical work and made
deliveries all over campus. The posi-

tion allowed me to become familiar ‘

with campus buildings and Oakland
in general. In short, I felt that I was a
part of Pitt even though I didn’t live
nearby. V

2. Visit the Commuter Student
Lounge in Nordy’s Place in the base-

'ment of the William Pitt Union This ‘

is a great place to meet fellow com-

muters and make ﬁiends. Meeting
other commuters can also open the
door to carpooling opportunities.

3. Get involved Ikrrow, easier said
than done, right? Those of us who rely
on the bus to get horrre know that it
is next to lI’1’lpOSSlblC to match your
extracurricular schedule to your bus
schedule. On top of that, many ac-
tivities and group meetings are held in
the evening, forcing students to either
stay on campus for hours on end or to
shuttle back and forth between horrre
and school many times a day.

But unless you are content with
secluding yourself from campus life,
you’re going to have to endure these
diﬂiculties and try to get involved de-

‘ spite them all. Oftentimes, you’ll ﬁnd

that, as a commuter, you’ll have to go
out of your way to get involved But
that’s all part of the commuting pack-
age. If you cannot attend late meet-
ings, speak to fellow group members
and try to participate in a different
way. Attend the events that do meet
your schedule and follow up on the
ones that don’t. Who knows? Your
enthusiasm might compel the group
to change its meetings to a more con-
venient time.

because you still live at home doesn’t
mean you should stay there. One of
the best ways to feel part of the col-
lege atmosphere is to come to campus
on the weekends, whether it’s just for
studying at Hillman Library or to at-
tend weekend events like the Bigelow
Bash in the spring.

5. Takethebus. With limited park-
ing and high -gas prices, public trans-
portation is the smartest commuting
option. For Pitt students, a ﬂash of
yourlDwillgetyouafreerideto
anywhere the Port Authority buses
will take you These long bus rides are
also perfect for catching up on read-
ing, homework or simply relaxing
with headphones on.

6. Take a load olf and use the
lockers. The average college student
usually doesn’t need to lug all of his
or her books to every class. But for a
commuter, more than two classes a
day translates into a two—ton book bag
full of the day’s textbooks, notebooks
and binders. What most commut-
ers don’t realize, however, is that the
"University offers lockers to students
who need them Getting a locker is as
simple as visiting the ticket window at

7. Get some sleep. Early to bed,
early to rise. For most college stu-
dents, Benjamin Franklin’s advice
falls on deaf ears. But for a college
commuter, it’s everything. Because
many commuters take the bus, they

often have to wake up as early as -

6:30 in the morning to. make it to
the stop on time. Because of this, I
sometimes found myself getting less
than six hours of sleep a night While
this might not seem like a big deal to
college students who have the option
of taking naps at their dorms or apart-
ments in between classes, it’s a huge
problem for commuters. For com-
muters, lack of sleep means you must
either make up for it in class orsettle
for looking like an over—caﬁ’einated
zombie for the entire day. Try to ar-
range your schedule to ﬁt an adequate
amount of sleep. Oh yeah, and stay
away from a]l—nighters.

While commuting can be diﬁicult,
it doesn’t havetobe an impedimentto
enjoying college. But it ’s your respon-
sibility to make it work

Summer, 2008

For many college students,
freshman year comes with a host
of important realizations. Perhaps
the most universal and undeniable
of these shared experiences comes
from purchasing and selling back
textbooks. Allow me to give a brief
summation: It sucks.

According to an article in The
New Yorker, the ﬁve largest text-
book retailers control 80 percent
of new college textbook sales in
North America. And in the past 22
years, the average textbook price
has risen 6 percent annually —
twice as much as the average rate
of inﬂation. *

So what does this mean for your
college experience? It means it’s
not uncommon to spend upward
of $500 in less than an hour in one
of the carnpus—owned bookstores.
It also means you’ll see only a
tiny fraction of what you paid for
the same books when selling them

 

back at the end of the semester.

Most students reluctantly wipe out A

part of their checking‘ accounts be-
lieving they have no alternatives.
If you’re willing to do a little
legwork and some searching, you
might be able to redirect all that
textbook money you were putting
aside and have a little fun with it.
For starters, ﬁnd out what text-
books you’ll need for your classes.
Now, I’m not talking about getting
a list of all the books your profes-
sors have listed associated with the
class. As you’ll ﬁnd out, only half
of them you’ll actually need, and
some of them you’ll never use in
the class’ at all. Don’t buy them.
Go to class for two weeks, see
how the system works, and then
detennine what you can and can’t
get away with buying. If you’re
worried about falling behind right

away, don’t be. If you’ve been at-

tending your.class, picking up the
textbook a week or so late won’t
leave you behind for the rest of the
semester.

to buy, I would heartily "recommend
anything that is not a campus book-
store. A report by Business Week
stresses the monopolistic policies
that these stores can get away with.
Common proﬁt margins at these
places run around 40 percent for
used textbooks, generating $11 bil-
lion in annual revenue. If you’re

looking to save some money, just

cut out the middlemen.

Web sites like Amazon.com
provide a large selection of obscure
textbooks, often for sale by other
students who have already had a
class using the same book you’re
seeking. Take advantage of this —
there is no markup, and ideally all
the money involved in these trans-
actions will stay between fellow
students. If Amazon doesn’t have
what you need, try looking around
online for some other options, such
as Chegg.com. Chegg was started
by a student at Iowa State Univer-
sity in 2001 and has been merging
with like—minded Web sites and
businesses to cut into the market of
overpriced texts and save you real

money 4- so let them.

If, however, you’re truly
strapped for cash, there’s one little-
known altemative that just might
allow you to eat for part of the se-
mester, too — the library systems.
This has a few cons associated with
it and can be a bit chancy, but if it
works out, you can get what you
need for straight As without drop-
ping a dime on books all semester.

Assuming you’re close to carn-
pus, there are two main library sys-
tems at your disposal: the Hillman
Library and the Carnegie Public
Library. Signing up at Carnegie
is easy: just bring a photo ID and
something with an Allegheny
County address on it, and you’ve
got your library card. Now you’ll
have access to everything in the
Carnegie system, which covers
about 25 separate libraries within
the area.

For a course textbook, your
best bet is the Hillman Library. In
addition to the main library, there
are about a dozen other libraries on
campus that are subject—speciﬁc.

  When buying books, it pays to shop around

Frick Fine Arts has a library con-
taining books about the ﬁne arts.
Eberly Hall has one that is speciﬁc
to chemistry. From the library’s
Web site you can do a search for
the books you need. A few minutes
for a search and a small trek up the
Upper Campus hill could save you
from the need to purchase a‘r$100
book.

If that doesn’t work, give Hill-
man Library’s E-Z Borrow system

a try. It will actually search through _

other college libraries’ systems
from all over the state to ﬁnd what
you need. Truth be told, it’s one of
the best—kept secrets on campus
for saving some serious cash. Just
check out PittCat —— the library’s
search page —— and you’ll see a link
for the Palci/E-Z Borrow seafeh.

It might take a little bit of ex-
tra work in the beginning of the
semester, but saving hundreds of
dollars for an hour or two of library
or Internet searching is something
nobody can afford to pass up.

For campuses,
urban beats, grass

by Richard Brown
Amt. Opt’/zio/2.1 Editor

Walking around Pitt’s campus, you
might notice something strange about it:
It’s really not much of a campus at all. Uni-
versity buildings share walls with bars, re-
tail stores and hospitals, a stark contrast to
the open green lawns and winding paths of
most traditional college campuses. _

Many people whom l’ve talked to think
that this is a bad thing a that an urban cam-
pus like Pitt’s can’t compare to the tradi-
tional green vistas and wide-open spaces of
a closed campus.

When I ﬁrst came to Pitt, my friends and
relatives said things like, “But Penn State’s
campus is so pretty! Why would you choose
Pitt?” Part of this was because I lived deep
in Nittany Lion country, but a lot of it was
that people simply don’t see the appeal of an
urban campus.

Unfortunately for these na1row—minded
Lions fans, there are a lot of advantages to
an urban school, and they’re things that are
easy to take advantage of and enjoy.

For instance, having an urban school-

means that you’re close to just about every-
thing. On a traditional campus you have to
walk way off campus to get to the nearest
coffee shop or pizza place that isn’t run by
the school, but in a school like Pitt, there are
stores and restaurants literally right across

‘ the street.

Need a new pair of shoes? There’s three

‘shoe stores within walking distance. Want

some Indian food? Take your pick of one of

the many Indian restaurants within a quar— -

ter—mile. A city campus means that you’re
close to everything that you need.

And for those things that aren’t right next
to you, there’s convenient transport as well
because the buses run right through campus.
Students at suburban schools sometimes
must rely on stringent shuttle schedules to
go anywhere outside the campus bound-
aries.' But with Pitt you have "an extensive
public transportation network and free ac-
cess to it with your Panther Card.

Urban campuses are ‘also convenient in
another way: Everything is close together.
On a traditional campus, buildings are sepa-
rated by acres of lawn and paths and narrow,
obnoxious streets for the people daft enough
to try to drive around campus. But all those
lawns and paths really only mean one thing:
more space between places that you have to

'be.

For instance, Penn State’s campus is

 

more than 1.5 miles across. If you want to
go from, let’s say, their engineering build-
ing to their indoor spoits facility, then you’d
better prepare yourself for a 1.2-mile hike
across campus. Now imagine that you had
to do that distance in the time you have be-
tween classes, and you start to see a prob-
lem.

But with Pitt, no building is more than
three-quarters of a mile away from any
other, and most.of them are clustered within
the same quarter of a mile. That means that
if you have 10 minutes to get from one class
to another, and they’re in different build-
ings, you could actually do it with time to
spare. '

And in case you ever want to move off
campus, which you probably will, you’ll
ﬁnd that off campus is pretty much on cam-
pus without dorm life. Most of the houses
that students live in are so close to Pitt
they’re basically dorms only without the
H)—swiping and security guards. And there’s
a staggering variety of housing from which
to choose as well, from single-room studios
to eight-bedroom monster houses with mul-
tiple kitchens.

Probably the best thing about being on
a city campus is the atmosphere. I think
of most campuses as kind of like cages —
they keep stuff out, but they also keep it in.
People only venture off campus when they
absolutely.have to, and they miss out on all
the exciting things that the surrounding en-
vironment has to offer.

But with an urban campus, the surround-
ing environment is the campus. Pitt not only
feels like a university but like a city as well.
There are helicopters whizzing overhead
and motorists doing their best to bend every
trafﬁc law known to man. You can go out
to your favorite restaurant or local bar and
then turn the comer and be basically back
on campus again.

With most campuses, there’s a hard bor-

der between being on campus and off cam-
pus, but here the line iskind of blurry.

You could walk for a mile in any direc-
tion and never really be sure when you’ve
left campus behind, and if you get lost, the
Cathedral is always there to guide you back
again. _

Sure, a traditional campus is pretty and
has lots of space to lie in the sun or play
Frisbee, but if you want a never-ending vari-

ety of choices, possibilities and excitement,

then there’s no better choice than to live in
the heart of it all on an urban campus.

Say goodbye to your   old friend Sleefi  

if ing _a fresh box of Wheat Thins
. while ‘sitting on my living room

by Katelyn Polantz
Eaitor in Chief

   

“We need to talk,” I said a
few nights ago as I watched
the glowing green numbers on
my alarm clock flick to 2:59
a.m. As much as I wantedto go
to sleep, I knew now, entering

_ into my senior year of college,

that it was time to end the re-
lationship.

Sleep and I officially broke
up after seeing each other ev-
ery night since the day I was
born and after three years of
riding a roller coaster of young
college love.

In the beginning our prob-
lems were simple. Sleep knew
that freshman year would be
difficult and that we’d be to-
gether less and less because
of work for classes, making

_, new friends and the wonders

of surfing the Internet late at
night getting in the way. I told
him I was unavailable because

I didn’t have enough time dur-
ing the day. Sleep understood,
and he didn’t visit on nights I
was too busy. p
Instead, I’d pound away on
my laptop, working on the 20
pages due the next morning for
a 9 a.m. class or sipping a cap-
puccino over a textbook in a
cozy chair at Hillman Library.
As tough as it was to put our

relationship on hold, getting

through college wasn’t too bad
without Sleep. I got used to the
adrenaline buzz that follows a
night of insomnia, and I liked
the numb feeling that comes

-from watching back—to-back

episodes of “Next” on MTV
until the sunrise. Besides, col-
lege and sleep just donft mix.
Distance put a strain on the
relationship, too. Back in high
school, Sleep and I were close.

As for weekends, that’s the
time for socializing. How could
Sleep and I possibly see each

to go to, people to meet. »

After 21 years, our‘relation-

bled.

“It’s not you, it’s me,” I

said a few months ago when I
realized that Sleep and I were
growing apart. We‘ tried _ to

to sleep earlier — to no _suc—,

The pain of the breakup was
too much to bear. I walked to
my bed —- lonely, awake — to
lie there until the sun rose. Just
one more night with Sleep, I
hoped. But no — it’s over.

Maybe we’ll get back to-

Don't be afraid to sniff your roommate

by Josh Green

Cola/nmL1t
‘W’

 

Moving into the dorms for the
ﬁrst time canies plenty of stresses.
Did I bring everything I need?
Will my RA be a tool? Will I get

_ 2?foot fungus from the communal

bathrooms? _

Is someone going to draw male
anatomy on my dry erase board?

The answers, respectively, are
no, maybe, probably not and yes.
But I don’t want to discuss the
petty worries of dorm life. The
most important thing to learn from

ﬁeshman dorms is whether or not ‘

your roommate is just a roommate
or is a friend.

9 Believe it or not, it can often
be difﬁcult to determine wheth-
er to introduce a roommate as
“my roommate” or “my friend.”
Thankfully, I have compiled the
criterion on which to judge this.
Just by asking myself questions, I
can conclude whether or not a per-
son would be a good roommate or

a good friend.

At some point in the summer,
students receive a housing- letter
that contains-the name of their fu-
ture roommate. A quick visit to Fa-
cebook can help in getting a sense
of the person. Is my roommate a

member of every group to which -

he has been invited? That means
he is a follower. What does her
proﬁle picture look like? Is it with
friends or did she take it alone in
her bedroom in front of a mirror?
My ﬁrst proﬁle picture was of
me dressed as Jesus. It was a Hal-

" loween costume. I imagine that

my roommate got pretty excited
about this since my name is Josh-
ua, which in Aramaic is Jeshua,

‘which was Jesus’ name. There

would probably be many perks
to being roommates with Jesus. I
wouldn’t know. You’d have to ask
my roommate.

Does my roommate have a lot
of pictures of people from home
set up on his side of the room? If
so, this means the person has many
friends and enjoys showingvthis to

people. There is nothing wrong
with that. If the eyes are scratched
out of the photographs, there is
probably something wrong.

Does my roommate spend
most of his time playing World of
Warcraft or Unreal Tournament?
If so, he is a great roommate. He
is quiet,_ non—confrontational and
almost a level 50. This person will
surely be a good roommate unless
I’m trying to bring biddies back to
my room. If he leaves, then he is
also a good ﬁiend.

' Does my’ roommate have a
nickname he received in prison?
Something like Hobbit or Bull-

dozer or Jackrabbit? Is J ackrabbit,

giving people tattoos in my com-
puter chair? Does Jackrabbit not
technically live in my room ac-
cording to Panther Central? If so,
then I know this person will make
a great friend but probably -an un-
reliable roommate.

What does my roommate smell

like? This will determine both the 0

quality of his friendship and room-

"rnateship. I don’t mean simply if

he smells  or not. Speciﬁcal-
ly, what does he smell like? Cin-
namon? Eggs? Cough medicine?
It may be hard to tell sometimes,
so wait until he is asleep and sneak
over to his side of the room. Give
him a nice long sniff. If the smell
is pleasing, it will be a beautiful
relationship. ‘

Does my roommate tryto smell

mewhile .I’m sleeping? This hap- .

pens moreoften than one might

‘think, so be prepared — just like

that song that Scar sings in “The
Lion King.” '
Somewhere between 3,000 and
4,000 freshmen students come to
Pitt each year. All of the students

who live in the dormitoiies are_

anxious about what kind of room-
mates they will receive. It’s a bit
like an arranged marriage. A bit.

’ It’s mostly not like an arranged

marriage. But a roommate is ei-
ther the easiest person to become
ﬁiends with or the easiest person
to loathe. What they say about re-

‘ lationships is also true about room-

mate paiiingz Opposites attract.

A funny person needs a room-
mate who thinks a lot of things
are funny. A loud, talkative room-
mate needs a quiet, good listener.
A person who takes a long time to
do things needs a patient, under-
standing roommate. A person who
listens to a lot of country music
needs his own room.

Unfortunately, it comes down
to the luck of the draw. Even the
housing surveys that ask questions
about different tastes cannot match
two people perfectly. The ~» dorms
are haunted with housing horror
tales about roommate matches that

just didn’t make sense. “I thought I ,

wrote that I don’t like jazz,” some-
one once told me. “But my room-
mate thinks he’s Duke Ellington.”
The questions I ask myself in
this piece can only help so much.
The most important piece of ad-
vice is this: Keep an_open mind.
And the snifﬁng. You really
have to sniff your roommate.

Summer, 2008

* by Giles Howard

Columrzidt

Freshman year was, for me, ex-
tremely exciting. It was full of new
friends, new experiences and new
challenges, all of which made me
a stronger person. ‘ I

But at the beginning of my _

freshman year I wasn’t sure that
everything was going to turn out
so Well. .

I wasn’t happy with a number
of my classes, and, although I had
a great group of friends, it became
rather boring hanging outwith the
same people doing the same things
day in and day _out. I’d wake up,
eat, go to class, eat, go to class, eat
and then end the day with a game
of poker in the dorm. The ﬁrst few

weeks of ﬁeshman year were bor-

ing and formulaic.
And then I started to become

A more involved on campus.

I suppose it all started with the
Activities Fair. The Activities Fair
occurs a few weeks into the ﬁrst

 

- semester of every year and is a

great way to meet people and get
involved in any number of student
groups on campus.
. I’d encourage everyone to, go
down to the fairwith a few friends
and spend maybe an hour check-.
ing out the various tables set up by
campus organizations. It doesn’t
take long, but it might be the most
important hour of your freshman
year. I

I remember .the experience as
somewhat chaotic and overwhelm-

ing, but I did leave signed up for _
four campus groups that interested

me. -

This eventually proved to be
too many, and an important piece
of advice that I’ll give right now
is not to become involved in too
many extracurricular activities. Of

the four groups I signed up for, I

dropped two after about a week.
Signing up for four was a good
way to ﬁgure out what exactly I
wanted to spend my time on, but
to have been involved in all four
throughout the ﬁrst semester of my

just to spend some time getting to
know the campus, meeting new

people and exploring the city. In-

volvement in campus organiza-
tions is, in my experience, a great
way to do this, but it’s also impor-
tant to avoid too many comrnit-
ments. ‘

Thankfully, it worked out that
the two groups I stuck with as a
freshman gave me plenty of oppor-
tunity to get involved on campus
while also leaving me with enough
free time to do some exploring on
my own. A

When you do settle on one or
two campus organizations to stick
with, it is important to become
truly’ involved in their meetings
and activities. Sure, it’s possible
to be a member of an organization
and just attend one or two events a

month, but I only really started to '
get anything out of my extracur-
ricular activities when Istarted to .

contribute more of my ‘time and

energy to die groups .1, had joined.
Be prepared to sacriﬁce a few
hours of the weekend to a group
activity, and don’t be afraid to ap-
ply for a leadership position as a

_ freshman. The more you put into

a campus organization, the more
you’ll get ou_t\of it.

Another. important" realization
that I’ve come to while looking
back on my freshman experience
is that participation ' in student
groups on campus taught me just
as much or more about myself and
the subjects I was ‘interested m as
did my academic work.

Student leaders of the organiza-
tions I was involved in were often
there to give me advice or help me
out with a problem I was having as
a freshman. Their help made fresh-
man year not only bearable but
also rewarding and enjoyable.

Don’t be afraid to turn to stu-
dent leaders on campus for advice
as a freshman. In my experience,
they are some of the best resources
on campus because they survived
the same things you are experienc-

  Activities can save your social life”

' great a demand on my time.
As a freshman, it’s important ‘

mg.

My ﬁnal point is that campus
organizations provide a great 
of community. Work and social
activities often go hand in hand at
student organizations in a way that

forms strong bonds between group

members.

Many of my_ best friends 
Pitt are the people that I lived with
in the dorms as a freshman, but
even more of my friends are people
I worked with in student groups.
It is important to develop these
friendships because their support

-will make the difﬁcult times of

freshman year easier and the good
times .of  year better.
Don’t let these opportunities
pass you by as a freshman. Attend
the Activities Fair, jointthe groifns
that interest you, and get involved

- as early as possible. The activities

that you take part in as a freshman
are part of the foundation for your

success during the rest of your ’

years at Pitt.

Visit Pittsburgh's
many neighborhoods

by Giles Howard

Ca/zmz/2zL1t

Oakland offers some great eateries,
shops and cultural experiences. It’s pos-
sible to spend all of freshman year ex-
ploring what Oakland has to offer but to
do so would be a mistake. As a fresh-
man, I spent my ﬁrst few. weeks almost
exclusively in Oakland, and I had a great
time. It’s a beautiful neighborhood and,
like I said, it has a lot to offer.

But eventually it becomes time to
branch out and start experiencing the
rest of what Pittsburgh has to give as
well. Sure, Oakland is wonderful, but
many different communities make up
this city and each is worth visiting when
new to the area.

Bloomﬁeld is a great example. It’s
a neighborhood known as Pittsburgh’s
Little Italy, and if you spend a few min-
utes walking through it, you’ll know
why. It’s home to some great Italian eat-
eries and shops, and every year it throws
an Italian festival complete with great
food and live music. I stumbled upon
the festival by accident as a freshman
last year while looking for a bookstore
in the area, and I enjoyed it so much that
I intend to go back next year as a sopho-
more. »

Squirrel Hill is another neighbor-
hood in Pittsburgh that every freshman
should check out. It’s the center of Pitts-
burgh’s Jewish community and is home
to a number of synagogues and Jewish
schools. It’s easily accessible by bus and
is a great place to go out to eat or spend
a day shopping. It’s also home to a mov-
ie theater that can be easily reached by
public transit. Squirrel Hill is so close
that there’s no excuse not to check it out
one weekend as a freshman.

Spending a day in a neighborhood
with a strong ethnic heritage is a great
way to learn about Pittsburgh’s past. Our
city has a rich history that isn’t always
reﬂected by Oakland, because Oakland
is essentially a college neighborhood.

Mt_. Washington is a neighborhood to
the west of Oakland and across the river,
and although it doesn’t offer the same
cultural history as either Bloomﬁeld or
Squirrel Hill, it does offer some unique
attractions. The nighttime view from

Mt. Washington was rated the second of ‘

10 “Most Beautiful Places in America”
by USA Today in 2003. It is nothing

 

short of stunning and probably serves as
the best introduction to the city of Pitts-
burgh.

You can‘ also get a great view of
the city from thetwo inclines that run
up and down Mt. Washington, and Pitt
students have free access to these with

the use of our student IDs. The neigh— .

borhood is also known for a number of
ﬁne restaurants, and these, combined
with the great view, make it the perfect
neighborhood to take a date.

The Strip District might not provide
as attractive a view as Mt. Washington or
as intriguing an ethnic history as Squir-
rel Hill and Bloomﬁeld, but it is one of
Pittsburgh’s more interesting shopping
districts. '

The Strip District is also home to
the Senator John Heinz History Center,
the largest history museum in the state.
There is no better place in which to learn
about the history of both the city and the
region whether you’re new to the area or
have lived here all your life.

These are just a few of the neighbor-
hoods that make up the ‘city of Pitts-
burgh. There are obviously a lot more
than the four that I have brieﬂy men-
tioned, and they all are worth visiting.

Don’t get me wrong: I love Oakland.
It’s a wonderful neighborhood, and I
spent most of my freshman year trying
to get to know it better. But Oakland is
only a small part of Pittsburgh, and it’s
important to experience as much of what
Pittsburgh has to offer as possible.

And although I know that I talked a
lot about whatone can “learn” from all
of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods, it’s also
important to be able to take a day during
the weekend and go have fun. Spending
a day shopping in the Strip District, go-
ing to a movie in Squirrel Hill or eating
dinner at a great restaurant on Mt.‘Wash-
ington can make the stress of freshman
year disappear at least temporarily.

I wish I could say I learned something
from B1oomﬁeld’s Italian festival, but
all I really remember is the great food
and the live music. It was a new experi-
ence, and that’s why I’m at college: to
gain new experiences, many of which
are‘educatioinal"and some of which are
just fun.

Every neighborhood in Pittsburgh is
full of these -new experiences. My ad-
vice is to explore as many as possible.

My friend Max is a Ken doll.
He’s not literally a Ken doll, just

metaphorically metaphors
are something you’ll learn about
now that you’re in college — in
the sense that he looks good in
pretty much anything. When you

‘ go shopping with him, you really

just want to dress him up. Max is
one of those annoyingly inspir-
ing people who thinks that just

because he can wear whatever he '
, wants because he will look good,

and thus feel good, everyone’
should do the same.

The other day, Max and I-
went window shopping and saw
a charming little outﬁt that was a
little kooky. Max, in hisidealistic
way, said that if someone were to
like said outﬁt, they should just
buy it, regardless of what other
people might think. In fact, Max
insisted, if he wantedto wear, say,
a Batman suit that day, he should

have‘ been able to without worry-
ingabout societal implications.
This idea ‘tickled me pink, if
only because I have always want-
ed to have a friend who wears su-
perhero costumes. .
Unfortunately, though, College

V World does not really accom-

modate or welcome ‘outrageous
and free—spirited fashion choices
into its ivory—tower arms. There
is a middle ground of fashion
that covers the majority of stu-
dents, but like abell curve — also
something you’ll learn about in
college, if someone strays more
than plus or minus a few stan-
dard deviations from the mean,
that person might be teetering on
the edge of two dangerous situa-
tions.

The ﬁrst source of trouble for
the garmently adventurous comes
when someone dresses to show

is the easiestiand fastest way to

‘- get something across about your-

who she is, and it turns out she’s _

not really like that at all. While I
certainly don’t encourage inno-
vative fashionistas to dial down
their style ‘to sheep-like, fashion

self, and it’s important to make
sure that you can back up what
your acid-washed strait legs are
putting on the table.

Take the case of the pseudo—in-
tellectual -professorial type. If this

person decides to don tweed, cor-,

duroy pants, a sweater vest, loaf-
ers, non-prescription specs and a
pipe all at once, he better be able
to speak Greek and tell me the
similarities between Zen Bud-
dhism and Wittgenstein, or else I
will call him a big, fat faker. Then
again, if he can do all of those
things in the short amount of time
my attention span grants our con-

versation, I will probably call him,

a big, fat pretentious person.

The second danger is the risk
of being unfairly stereotyped.
College is full of judgmental,
shallow people. Sure they’re
good people, but let’s face it,
we’re all human, and we all make
silly little judgments about pure
strangers. And since fashion is

the easiest and fastest way to put
something out about one’s self, it
is also the easiest and fastest way
to garner clues about a" person

without having to actually talk to p

him.

Say you encounter a Pitt News
columnist who i just happens to
put a lot of stock into the idea that
you are what you wear.

If you were wearing a Batman

suit, she would probably think

that either you are a superhero,
or that you are crazy, or that you
want people to think you don’t
care that they think you are crazy,
which, to this Pitt News colum-
nist, seems kind of silly, because
if you weren’t wearing the Bat-
man suit in the ﬁrst place, she
wouldn’t think you were crazy.
And that just makes the colum-
nist think you might be a little
insecure.

On the ﬂip side of that, though,
the columnist has probably also
made a number of base judgments
about people who don’t make an
effort to have any kind of indi-

Be sure to have an individual style

vidual style. So, if you’re sitting
next to someone who is dressed
pretty similarly to you or taking
a stroll with yourboy toy in your
matching sweater sets, she will
probably force you into an unfa-
vorable category of clone.

There is simply no way 

, with this columnist, just as there

is no way to win in college -
something else you are soon to

‘ learn. ’

V ‘ Although it can-be dangerous
to be fashionably extravagant, it
can also be dangerous to be fash-
ionably monotonous. So perhaps
when choosing your ensembles,
you should just wear whatever
the heck you want. And if you
feel -inclined to wear a Bagnan
suit, please do. Come and ﬁnd
me, I will be your best friend and
make you cupcakes. But beware,
because if the bat signal does go
off from the top of the Cathedral
of Learning, it’s up to you.

Nllf there’s only one piece of
information new students should

remember before starting at"

Pitt, it’s that college-is not high
school.
,_In many ways, I’m sim-

_ply stating the obvious. A high

school education is something
most people in the United'States
have access to, while college is
more of a privilege and an ex-
pensive one at that. Most college
professors don’t require you to
ask permission before leaving
the lecture to visit the restroom.
And few public high schools in-
volve dorms and roommates.

-.-But despite the countless dif-
ferences, many new students
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to shed their high
school skin. Being successful in
college both academically and
socially means leaving your
high school days behind.

First of all, try to wean your— _~
. self from the high school “clique

mentality.” Remember the jocks

 

and the cheerleaders, the drama
dorks and the computer geeks?
In ~most high schools, these
groups never mix.

They eat at separate lunch .ta-
bles and sitin separate areas of
the classroom. While‘ there are
groups in college who tend to

stick together, individual people’

generally have no problem mix-

ing and mingling with new fac— ‘

es. The days of popularity and
“dorkdom” end at the hallowed
gates of college.

Second, college is hard work.
No, I’m not stating theobvious
again. Many new students, fresh
from the lax scholastic lifestyle
of high school, have no idea what
they are getting themselves into.
It might have been easy to get
straight As in high school with-
out breaking a sweat, but in col-

lege, only hard work and effort '

will get you the good grades.‘
Also, college professors have
much higher expectations than
high school teachers. Your high
school teacher would probably
cut you some slack if your dog

ate your homework. But before
you start college, you should ei-
ther think of much better, elabo-
rate excuses or actually do your
work. Depending on the class,
professors generally do not ac-
cept late work. Missed the ﬁnal
because you accidentally slept
in? Good luck passing the class,
because you probably will not
be able to make it up.

When it comes to large lec-
ture courses, it can often be dif-
ﬁcult to ﬁnd the motivation to at-
tend class, let alone do the work.
Unlike high school, where some
teachers will continuously pes-

“'_ ter you’about repeated absences '

or late work, most college pro-
fessors simply do not care.
They’ don’t and won’t learn
your name, and whether or not
you attend class makes no dif-
ference to them. This means you

have to take the initiative if you '
want to succeed. High school is ‘

a teaching environment, :w.hile
college is a learning environ-

ment. Because of this, you have

to learn to be a self-motivator.

 
 

In high school, watching
what you eat is usually a piece
of cake. For one thing, students
only have to worry about what
to eat for lunch and, if you were
lucky, your high school provided
you with nutritious options.

And since .most high school
students live at home with their
parents, they are able to consume
healthy, home—cooked meals on
a regular basis. But college is a
completely different story. The
many restaurants and grocery
stores in and around campus are
enough to tempt any freshman to
eat as much as he can. But if you
want to avoid the Freshman 15,
you should make sure you stay
away from too much ice cream
or those late-night pizza orders.

Many new college students
sometimes go crazy with their
newfound independence. After
living in that high school bub-
ble for four years, some fresh-

‘men ﬁnd themselves partying

more than they should. Don’t
go overboard. There’s nothing

wrong with a night of fun every

  You're not in high   school anymore

_once in a while, but make sure
you don’t make it a regular oc-
currence. Otherwise, you’ll see
your grades slip and your oppor-
tunities for success decrease.
Similarly, doing well in col-
lege has a lot to do with how
well you manage your time.
In high school, most students
have their schedules already
planned out for them: school,
after school activities or work,
home, sleep. It’s not so easy in
college, because classes do not
always ﬁt in the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

time frame. So, it’s largely your _

responsibility to organize your
study, activity, work and class
schedule in the most responsible
way.

Clearly, the differences be-

tween college and high school
are inﬁnite. To ensure your tran-
sition into college is smooth, it
is essential to leave your high
school days where_ they belong
— in the past.

Give your room its own unique style

by Brandon Pfeffer

Columnidt _

    
 

If this is your ﬁrst time -at
school, it might also be your ﬁrst
time living away from home. Nat-
urally, you’ve checked all those

online lists telling you what you ,

need to bring with you: storage
units, linens, Depends. What they
don’t tell you on those lists is that
everybody is reading it at the same

time you are and packing the same "

stuff you are. ‘If you don’t want
your bedroom to resemble every
other donn space in your hallway,
here are a few substitutions you
can make to your lO—by—8 cell, uh,
I mean room, to give it a‘little ﬂa-
vor and set it apart.

1. Rasterbations instead of post-
ers. Forget the annual poster sales.
Sure, it might be a rite of passage,
but the massive campus poster sale
is also the reason why everyone
you know on campus has the same
exact Salvador Dali poster hanging

C over her bed.

 

Y<>r:"sZ—.«:-' uV-v””f%W“~\/ 

Rasterbations allow you to use
any image you can ﬁnd on the In-
ternet or one you’ve uploaded to
create an enormous,_black—dotted

poster by blowing up the image .

to whatever size you choose. Not

"only is it unique in letting you

choose any image you want, but
it serves as an interesting cross be-
tween posters and wallpaper. Just a
few of these printed out will cover
any white space in the room, and
when it’s time to move out, just
tear it all down, no money lost. For
those who are feeling motivated,

_try printing one out in black and

white, then coloring in the white
space with crayon or colored pen-
cil. If you’re interested in the idea,
check it out at homokaasuorg/ras-
terbator.  -

2. A hammock instead of a bed.
This is a no—brainer, except for the
difﬁculty of ﬁguring out how to ac-
tually hang the hamrnock up, what
to do with the bed and how to treat
some potentialback problems that
might deyelop through a lack of
back support during sleep.

Still, a comfortable new harn-
mock can be found online for $50
to $100 and will cut_down on wast-
ed room space, which — especially
if you live in Towers -— is already
at a premium. When you need to
practice your yoga routine, just
roll your’ hammock up, problem
solved. If you and your roommate
both agree to hammocks, you’ll
have space in which to squeeze" a
foldable pingpong table.

3. Mood lighting instead of efﬁ-
ciency lighti/ng. Don’t worry about
getting a three—pronged twisty lamp
that can maneuver around two cor-
ners and light up a textbook. There
is plenty of time for studying later.
As a new student, direct your light-
ing ambition toward some ambi-
ence. , ‘

Candles are usually prohibited
in dorm rooms, so you’ll have to
search elsewhere. Fluorescent
black lighting is always guaran-
teed fun in a box, but the effect

will spook some guests who might

take offense to the illumination of
certain stains ontheir clothing.

Allow me to recommend lava

' lamps. Invented by Edward Craven

Walker in the 1960s, lava lamps
_are still used for their soothing
and trance—inducing glow. It won’t
help you see anything clearer, but
stress release is equally important
in achieving academic success.

If you still ﬁnd yourself stuck
using the standard ceiling lights
in your dorm room, any type of
translucent—colored, non—ﬂamma~

ble wrapping material will work’
' as a cover over the light, thereby

changing the hue of the bulb.

4. Fish instead of a roommate.
While short on conversation skills,
you’ll ﬁnd that ﬁsh are more agree-
able, don’t interrupt Very often and
will.never leave you locked out in
the hallway staring at a Scrunchie
on the doorknob. Fish don’t tend
to blast Last Call with Carson Daly
at 1:15 in the morning or eat your

‘brownies when you’re not there.

All things told, they make an ex-

cellent substitution for roommates. _

How you drive your roommate off
is up to you.

C

If your attempts fail, however,

‘ and you ﬁnd yourself unable to

make the trade-off, keep a few
things in mind. \V1th your hous-
ing contract, you have essentially

‘signed away any privacy for the

next few months, so get it in while
you can. Erect a divider of some
sort, perhaps a tapestry or sheet
that -drapes from ceiling to ﬂoor.
This. way, you don’t have to con-
stantly look awkwardly across the
room at one another. And if you
went with the harnmock/pingpong
table combination, don’t A worry:
You can simply pin the tapestry up
whenever you want to get a game
in.

There you have it: a few easy
ways to give your living space
some personality. Remember,
you’ll probably be stuck there for
at least eight months, so make it
livable and move big stuff around
while there’s still some open
space.

don at bkp3 @pitt.edu.

Dos and Don'ts
for riding the bus

by Molly Green
Columniat

There are those who scoff at public trans-
portation. It’s crowded. It’s loud. It’s dirty.
Those people make outrageous claims,
things like “the buses never seem to get any-
where on time” or “my legs always stick to
the seat?

These .are lies ‘— most likely propaganda

‘spread by the campus bicyclists (watch out

for them).

In Pittsburgh, the bus system is called
the Port Authority, and it is a treasure to be
cherished by all. Picture this: 22,000 pounds
of assorted metal alloys and rubber waiting
for you with open doors, ready to take you
anywhere within the great land of Allegheny
County like some giant gas—powered stallion.
Thrilling, right? A

Oh, yes, it’s hard not to get excited about
the bus system, which has countless advan-
tages that no car —— and certainly no bike —
can oﬁer. "

The most important perk: It’s free — after
you pay a mandatory student transportation
fee — for Pitt students. Just ﬂash your pretty
little Panther Card at a bus driver, and you’re
in." You don’t pay for gas. You don’t pay for
extravagant city parking fees. You don’t pay
for anything. You’re a bus kid now, which
means you roll fo’ free. ‘ ‘

It’s convenient. Buses run approximately
every half hour, depending on where you
want to go. This is especially useful if you
live off campus and need a fast, efﬁcient way

6 to get to class. Also, the buses are a great way

to explore the city. Pittsburgh is a beautiful
and interesting place, and the surrounding
neighborhoods of Oakland all have their

own greatshops, restaurantsand other attrac- I

tions. There are several buses that run on both
Forbes and Fifth avenues that go anywhere
from Shadyside to Downtown to the North
Hills. ”

It’s good for the environment. Yes, you’ve
heard it all before, but using public transpor-
tation as opposed to a car reduces gas usage,
which reduces greenhouse gas emissions,
which reduces global warming, which re-
duces the melting of polar ice caps, tropical
storms and certain impending doom for us

It offers endless entertainment. It’s an

‘excellent time to catch up on‘ reading, and

there is a great chance that on any one given
bus, there is at least one crazy person. Once,

I heard a man scream into his cell phone, “I'

will destroy you and your family.” It was like

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnevvs_.com

 

a really intense, real-life version of “The S0-
pranosf.’

Port Authority also has a distinct bus eti-
quette that must be followed with great dedi-
cation. As your tour guide into the illustrious
world of the Port Authority, I thought I’d give
you the dos and don’ts.

DO ﬁgure out when to show your Panther
Card. This is a delicate matter. The general
rule is -that when going inbound (going to-
ward Downtown), show the card as you get
on. When going outbound (going away from
Downtown), show the card as you get off.

DO pull the little yellow wire running It

across the top of the bus to designate your
stop. This might seem like common sense
but, before you judge, just know that some
life-experiencedeprived people — myself
included — did not know this little fact before
coming to our semi—urban campus, OK?

DO ﬁgure out the bus schedule in ad-
vance. The buses are never really on time, per

I se. But you can become very good at predict-

ing when a bus will come. If you come about
10 minutes prior to the scheduled stop time,
the bus will probably arrive soon. . _

DO give up your seat for the elderly when

_ the bus is full. This is just a common cour-

tesy, and if you don’t do it, you will get well-

deserved mean looks from the rest of the pas- ‘

sengers.

DO NOT sit by loud people on cell
phones. Sometimes, it’s entertaining. Usual-
ly, it’s just armoying. Sony, I can’t really give
any advice on how to avoid these people. I
would recommend bringing an .mp3 player
and headphones just in case.

DO NOT take the wrong bus. LoolE‘care-
fully at the name of the bus you are”board-
ing. A lot of buses have similar names, for

pr ‘example the,_71B and the~71D. Ona sunny
"day,,:tlie'letters' kind of blur. And though they

go in the same general area, you can end up
quite far away from where you intend to go.
DO NOT miss your stop. Make sure you
are aware of your surroundings at all times.
For example, you could be entirely absorbed
in reading a gripping article in The Pitt News
— and who could blame you! — and the
next thing you know, you could be miles
away from where you are supposed to be.

Follow these rules, and you should have -

an easier college — and urban — experience.
If not, there is an unfortunate possibility that

someone will ﬁnd you in a ditch somewhere _

with tread marks nmning up ‘and down your
body. Goodluckl "

Sleeping in can be both good and bad"

by Dan Vetanovetz
Columniat

 

You know it’s bad when sleep-
ing in becomesia moral problem

Many students might ﬁnd that
it’s the best way to capitalize on a
Saturday morning. Without classes
to attend and plenty of time to do
work after noon, it seems like it’s
a logical course of action. Students
see it as a reward for a hard night
of partying and, in rare cases, a
hard week of studying. However,
I asked myself one Saturday after-
noon why I had rewarded myself.

First, as you will ﬁnd in many

‘introductory psychology and biol-

ogy courses, you should know that
your body uses sleep to recover
from the previous day’s work and
to prepare for the next day. It var-
ies depending on the person, but the
average amount of sleep an adult
body needs is eight hours a night.
Although co-workers usually ac-
cuse me of being immature, I am‘
technically an adult, so I should

technically be getting eight hours
of sleep every night in order to keep
good productivity. .

Second, you should know that
there are some students who take
studying to a moral level. When we
don’t study, we feel we have been
bad. ’ However, we haven’t been
bad like an employee who doesn’t
iron his collar or a lone driver using
the carpool lane. On the contrary,
we will still feel bad about the re-
mission the following week unless
we’ve somehow made up for it

So students sleeping in might
fall into two categories: sleep-
ing otf a hangover or sleeping off
late—night studying. If a student

is sleeping off a hangover every '

morning, it seems he’s drawing out
his proper exit from college. Either
he ﬁnds classes so easy that he can
drink every night, and so he should
go to grad school or get a job, or he
doesn’t ﬁnd his classes so easy, but
he also doesn’t care about them, and
so he’ll be getting the old heave—ho

from the university soon enough. - .

A student could also be sleeping

in because she was studying late
the night before. In this case, sleep-
ing in becomes a reward. American
society is built around the 9—to—5
workday, and I’m sure many stu-
dents are familiar with being told
that we’re sleeping the day away or
the day is halfway over if we sleep
until noon. One way to wriggle out
of criticism for sleeping in is to ac-
knowledge that we’ve earned it.
I’m not saying that someone’s
got it wrongif he earned a sleep-
in by partying really late the night
before. I’m just saying that it’s un-
likely to help his grades very much.

On the ﬂip side, as I saw it for the -

ﬁrst few years of college, I was re-
warding myself for a hard night of
studying.

However, this became a prob-
lem, as I could eventually feel just
as good about myself staying up
late and staring at a book as I could

if I was studying really hard. I got“

caught up in bragging about how
little sleep I got, which was always
a good measure of prowess or
something sirrrilarly ridiculous.

By losing sleep during the week,
I was cutting down on cognition
abilities, and the improved grades
I was supposed to be getting from
studying all night were compro-
mised by not knowing what was
going on in class. Ifl were really
serious about how it was morally
good to study and that losing sleep
showed I was studious, it’s absurd
that I would reward myself with
more sleep on the weekends. Re-

ally, if it were as serious as I pre-

tended it was, I would have realized
that I was rewarding myself for in-
consistent study patterns. A
However, there are hopefully
few people who have such a weird
relationship with classes. Whether
I were a dogmatic studying freak
or not, there are other things I was
missing out on by sleeping in,
which I was only able to discover
because I had stayed up all night,
rather than got up early.
Sometimes I would take early
morning walks_ in a studying-
induced daze and ﬁnd Oakland
eerie and quiet, except for birds.

Early morning garbage collec-
tors were replaced by commuting
coffee—shop workers. Then came
the breakfasters, who had lines
traced under their eyes rather than
gouged.

When I forced myself to get up
early for registration shenanigans,

breakfast suddenly became a lot I

more tempting. After breakfast, the

day becamepeculiar and large in
. front of me. While studying late and

sleeping in all came on borrowed
time, I felt ahead of it all when I got
up early. The only drawback is that
I felt like I was turning into my par-
ents.

It occurred to me: Maybe sleep-
ing in isn’t always a good idea,
but it’s not because it steals time
from studying. Mornings can be 5'
terrible time to -miss,—especially in
Oakland. Maybe I could be bad
for studying too little, but I could
also be bad for studying too much.
However, I think I’m better off not
making it a moral decision at all.

Learn to ask  

by Dan Vetanovetz
Colu/n_/ullt

I could be a national hero. I could
introduce a new philosophy that would
solve the problems currently plaguing the
world.

Now if onlyl could get out of bed
the ﬁrst time my alarm goes off. If only
I could write an argument that didn’t
degenerate into name—calling. Now that
I think about it: I don’t know any great
leaders, or at least any leaders I’d want
to be, that rely on generalizations, rnini—
mal use of facts and liberal application of
leaps of faith like I do.

It would be a pretty terrible existence
if it weren’t for all the students who are
similar to me in those respects, who I ﬁnd
to ‘be comfortable companions. We were
the ones who marched to the ticket booth

- in the union when we heard that Karl Rove

would be speaking because we were go-
ing to bring him down. We were the ones
who sat in philosophy class and believed
it when philosophers claimed there was
no way to prove the world really existed.

We’re the gullible ones. It only recent-
ly occurred to me that if Ihad been less
willing to simply believe a lot of things,
I could have accomplished a lot more.
I’ll admit, it’s nice to dream about doing
great things, and it’s nice to have a differ-
ent understanding of the world opened up
by learning something new. However, this
becomes a big‘problem when we imagine
that no one before us has tried what we’re
doing now. L _ _ .

That tired workhorse of college stu-

dent canon, “South Park,” offered an._il- *

lustration of this dilemma when college
students swarmed the town for a concert.
Befriending the two chief protagonists,
the students offered them knowledge that
was like, totally awesome.

Which could really change the world,
man. Pumped up on dogma, they didn’t
see any necessity to approach any situ-

ation with a line of skeptical questions.

They instead operated on intuition and
good feelings alone.

As it was pointed out in a column in
The Pitt News on the day of Rove’s visit,

students asking questions of him should -

have acted like journalists. That means

‘asking questions based on known facts

and building up to an answer that might
not be earth shattering but would rather be,
another weight that could tip the scales.

 

questions Wisely

That means calm and level-headed
questions that must be grounded in as
many stabilizing practices as possible,
such as research. And research doesn’t
mean looking up Karl Rove on Wikipe—
dia, reading an article about him in The
New York Times and calling it a day.

We knew there was some other way to
go about it, but there ‘were a lotof ques-
tions we were all just itching to ask. As a
friend put it, everyone who went up to the
podium was thinking to their self, “I could
be the one to take down Karl Rove!”

My knowledge of my own gullibility
was given another dimension when a pro-
fessor pointed out how often students ac-I
cept what philosophers like Descartes ar-
gue at face value. We’re willing to claim
that we can’t prove that the world around
us is real, since if it really wasn’t real
there would be no way to tell.

Think of it as something like the Ma-
trix: If we were in it, could we tell that
we were in it or that it was different from
reality? iWhen my philosophy class end-
ed, many students would leave the room
wearing glum expressions, feeling hope-
less because they couldn’t tell whether or
not our existencewas real. ~

I could easily ﬁll this entire paper with

‘arguments stemming from the one above,

but my real point is, why believe that this
worldmight not be real in the ﬁrst pl-ace?
Why be so willing to accept such a crazy
idea? I was able toaccept thisworld just
ﬁne for 18 years until I came to college,
and I_ discovered all the solutions to the

world’s newly discovered problems.

So the next time a fellow student en-
lightens me by yelling. that freedom of
speech is everything, I think I should
reply ‘calmly that it’s worth very‘ little if
there isn’t anything intelligent to say. And
if I feel the desireto‘ shout a mantra" of my
own, I’ll ask this very simple and unas-

suming question:'What do I know about

what I’m saying? -
- It’s no good to operate on the belief
that we’ve found that one universal an-

swer and that the only trick is to show it

to everyone else. In retrospect, it ‘seems

- silly how easily I believed I had found the

one answer to, anything, when a healthy
amount of skepticism would have saved
me a lot of trouble.

Now, with a question that I’m sure is
part of a budding tradition: If only I’d
known that when I was a freshman.

Tips for doing Well in the classroom

by Shane 
Columnidt

Coming into my freshman year at
Pitt, I was more concerned with the
social aspects of college rather than
academics. Unlike my parents, who
were constantly asking me ques-
tions about what classes I would be
taking and other academic-related
topics, my mind was on the 2006
Pitt football season, going to parties
and gettingout of my house, rather
than wondering how to succeed in a
territory so unfamiliar to me.

Although I will not deny ‘that
college is truly an experience that

~ you must learn through both your

failures and triumphs, it never hurts
to get a little help, a concept you
will deﬁnitely need to remember
throughout your four years at Pitt.
Accordingly, I have put together a
few tips for succeeding in the class
room at Pitt. '
First, build a relationship ‘with
your professors and advisers. Com-
ing into college might be viewed
as the ultimate rite of passage ﬁorn

  

‘cause “shut up 8: t it yoursel”
wa too longicaind sounded funny.

childhood to adulthood, but it is
nevertheless an experience that is
initially unfamiliar to all.

When I ﬁrst came to Pitt, I
thought I knew exactly which
classes I wanted to take and exactly
what I wanted to major and minor
in. I thought I knew the exact path
I would take over my four years
at Pitt Oh, how wrong I was. As a
freshman, you will surely begin to
deﬁne what your interests are and
maybe, and more importantly, ﬁg-
ure out what you don’t like. Balanc-
ing this relationship is incredibly dif-
ﬁcult but fortunately one you do not
have to resolve alone.

Both your academic advisers
and professors are there to help you
ﬁgure out what your interests are
and how to eﬂ’ectively chase those
interests. The University requires
students to meet with an academic
adviser twice a semester, but I en-
courage you, as freshman, to de-
velop a strong relationship with
your adviser. By going and talking
to your adviser and sharing your in-
terests and non—interests with them,

 _ FRIENDLY LITTLE FOODIOINT.

On 0aklanc__l_A”ve..
Just §outh of“ Forbes
,3 682—-fire
FUELANDFUDDLE.COM

they will be able to more easily de-
velop a plan for your academic fu-
ture at Pitt.

And incidentally, you will be able
to determine what your interests are
and what you would like to pursue,
both academically and profession-
ally. _

-Upon entering Pitt, I was a po-
litical science and philosophy major.
Although there is nothing wrong
with either one of those majors -
both programs are very strong here

at Pitt — I now ﬁnd myself, after,

just completing my sophomore year,
on a completely different track as an
urban studies and communication
major. By going to diﬂerent profes-

sors’ ofﬁce hours and talking with ,

professors after class, I was able to
have more thorough discussions
about the topics of the courses and
their related majors.

Although it might be intimidat-
ing atﬁrst — atleastitwas forme
—- virtually all professors are more
concerned with seeing their students
succeed than anything else. Build-
ing relationships with professors

enabled me to develop my interests
ﬁirther, particularly in the urban
studies and communication majors,
and allowed me to determine what
I wanted to pursue over my remain-
ing years at Pitt and beyond.

Last, and maybe most important-
ly, become an active and involved
student in the classroom.

_ Often in the large lecture classes
you will ﬁnd that very few people
volunteer. I will admit that in the
large lecture classes I have taken, I
did not volunteer often during my
freshman year. But volunteering
and being an involved student in the
classroom is one of the most irnpor—
tant things you can do. It not only
familiarizes your face with the pro-
fessor, something that will deﬁnitely

beneﬁt -your grade when it comes 5

‘time for professors to distribute
grades, but it also aids your overall
education.

In the classes that I did not par-
ticipate in and relied more heavily
on the  and assignments, I
found myself gaining less out of the
actual class itself and not enjoying

the class. In the classes where I was
engaged, I gained much more out of
the courses and did not need to rely
on lecture notes, readings and other
assignments as much in order to do
well and enjoy them.

Before I came to college, both
my grandfather and my father gold
me that the reason “you go to("col—
lege is to learn how to think” In
order to stimulate your mind, chal-
lenge your preconceived beliefs and
get the most out of the educational
experience at Pitt, it is so impor-
tant that you engage yourself in the
classroom and build relationships
with your professors and advisers.

Ultimately, a piece of paper that
says the University of Pittsburgh on
it and your name won’t get yogi, or
help you keep,‘a job. It is the intellect
demonstrated at that position that
Will help your career. Going to class,
doing the work and basically just
“getting by” might be the path that
will help some get the grades, but
the value of the class will be lost.

Usethe entirety  
of your  meal plan

by Dan Carnarda

Colummidt P

To those who know-me, it might seem

ironic that I’m giving advice on how to‘

wisely use meal plans. There I was in April
doing my biarmual ﬁnals week hurry~up—
and—spend-my—Dining

Dollars-so—my-mom—won’t-kill-me
shopping at Market Central’s Quick Stop.
My last receipt reminded me of the $257
Dining Dollars_ left in my account. I loaded
my basket with 36 Whatchamacallit bars,
four boxes of Cheerios,—three bags of Twiz-
zlers. and two bags of Bugles, adding prices
in my head and scanning the tiny aisles for
the remaining $197 worth of groceries I
needed.

And I wasn’t alone.

Quick Stop was ﬁlled with other stu-
dents carrying around snack foods in
amounts usually only seen at Costco." As I
waited to check out, I lamented that with
$257, I could have downloaded the entire
Three 6 Maﬁa discography or bought Pi-
rates season tickets. ‘ »

‘From my meal .plan mismanagement,
I learned fromlmy mistakes and can offer
decent advice. Meal plans might seem triv-
ial, but with the tuition for Pitt at $12,106

a year, not including room and board, stu— '

dents should maximize every dollar spent
onitheir educations.

It’s crucial to understand how your meal
plan works. It wasn’t until halfway through
my ﬁrst semester at Pitt that I realized my
Dining Dollars didn't carry over to the next
semester. Pitt provides students informa-
tion about meal plans in their freshman ori-
entationmaterial, and you should actually
read it. ’ ‘

I The easiest way to avoid under-using or
over-using your meal plan is to understand
how they work.  students residing in
residence halls are required to purchase one
of the offered meal plans. They range from
the Ultimate Access Tier at $2,325 to'Din-
ing Pass Tiers starting at $1,550. If you’ve
purchased one of the Ultimate Access Tiers,

you’re able to eat at Market Central or any O

other University restaurants on campus that
accepts meal _passes as much as you want
throughout the semester. 0 4 l 0‘

Ultimate Access Tiers come with few
Dining Dollars, meaning that you’re limit-
ed to eating almost exclusively where meal
plans are accepted and will have to pay out
of pocket if you choose to go to Pizza Hut
or Burger King. ‘ .

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Make sure you actually eat’-at places
where you can use your mealsor Dining
Dollars. Oakland might have a wide variety
of restaurants, but limit the amount of mon-
ey youspend on eating out. You’re wasting
your money by eating at India'Garden ev-

_ ery day. or buying a coffee at Starbucks. Try
to ﬁnd a balance between the various eater— 0
ies in Oakland and the University—provided

restaurants.

- To avoid getting sick of eating the same
food every day, vary the places you eat. Pitt
offers a wide array of places to buy and eat
food, such as Pizza Hut in the William Pitt
Union to Einstein Bros. Bagels in Posvar
Hall, both of which will allow you to pur-
chase their food with yourmeal plan, leav-
ing you with cash to spend on more impor-
tant things. _ ‘

It wasn’t until halfway through my ﬁrst

of decent food at Market Central. Usu-
ally I’m an extremely picky eater, staying
within a very small comfort zone. Once I
branched out, I found that I loved stir—fry

is food service, so it’s designed to appeal to
as many people as possible.

As you enter your freshman year at Pitt,

Tips for atrendy,nottraSl1y first year

by Tom VanBuren
Aunt. Arty a/23
Eﬁertai/2Incnt'E3itor

   

Get excited, freshmen, because it’s time for
you to move in to your very own dorm room!
No parents, no curfews, by God, we’1l liv
like kings! Right? -

__«_,,Not exactly. Donn life isn’t always easy,
and unfortunately, the secrets to getting along

with others and living on your own for the ﬁrst ~
time are ones you have to discover for yourself. _

There are some useful dos and don’ts, howev-
er, to help keep your regrets about this ﬁrst year
to a minimum ‘

DO  your room. This is your space
— your one and only sanctuary for the entire

year — so spice it up a bit Give it some per— A

sonality by buying some posters at the Univer-
sitﬁiposter sale this fall or get a cool calendar
so you can keep all your social engagements in
order. -

DON’T give yourroom toomuch personal-
ity. An empty bottle of Jack Daniels looks cool
on the bookshelf, but an underage citation from
your RA doesn’t. Ladies won’t be impressed
by your Playboy centerfolds wall calendar, and
even though bongs are both practical and deco-
rative, you best not take your chances

 

92

DO get creative in the kitchen, Panther
Central might not let you have a hot plate in
your roorn_, but don’t.let the man keep you
down. Did you know that you can make a

grilled cheese sandwich on a clothes iron? ‘Or

scrambled eggs in the microwave? You might
not win any culinary contests, but you can cer-

' tainly do better than a cup of ramen and cereal.

DON’T, however, set ﬁre to your room.

‘Roasting hot dogs over an open ﬂame is fun

but not when the ﬂame has been’ set in your
wire mesh garbage can. Remember, you want
to  your regrets, not increase them,
and making a name for yourself as “the kid
whose microwave exploded” isn’t the best

.'waytodoso.

DO leave your door open. The best way to
make friends in your dorm is to be proactively
social — invite people in, let them see who you
are and hang out for awhile.

DON’T leave your door open when you go
to class. Your stuﬁ will get stolen, and you’ll be
stuck wearing that same stupid “COLLFBE”
T—shirt from “Animal House” all semester.

DO have fun. Underage drinking is illegal,
butthefactofﬂrernatteristhatmanyofyou —
if not most —— will still do it At that rate, you’re

- better off doing it with a small group of friends '

rather than at a giant house party in South Oak-
land ‘

 

DON’T be stupid about it To reiterate,
underage drinking is illegal. If you get caught,
enjoy having your name on record in The Pitt
News’ police blotter for the rest of your life.
If you get sick, have ﬁm getting the smell of

urine. and vomit out of your University—issued _

mattress. And those alcohol awareness classes
they make you take if you really go too far?
Boring. S - «

DO make friends with your RA. The resi-
dent assistant on your floor can be either your
man on the inside or a thorn in your side, so
be careful not to burn any bridges too soon.
The RA might write you up for any number of

‘ things, from having too many extension cords
‘ to making too much noise. Why not make
one more ‘little social connection and just be

friends? It can’t hurt '

DON’T make the RA feel bad for doing
his or her job. It isn’t easy or fun-to be an en-
forcer to your peers, but if you pass out in the
hallway with 40s of beer duct taped into your
hands, the RA doesn’t have a choice whether
you’re friends or not. Have some class. A

DO get out of there! Campus has an excit-
ing social scene, and the rest of the city even

‘more so. Nesting in your cozy little room is an

easy thing to do, but if you get out every now

and then, you’ll realize how much you can _

miss out on. Besides, if you really wanted to

"go to an overpriced state school where there’s

nothing to do, you would be at Penn State.
DON’T be afraid to stay in sometimes.

College life is often frenetic, and if you don’t .

take a little “me” time every now and then,
you’ll be having nervous breakdowns by mid-
terms. Kick backwith an Antoon’s pizza and
anight of cable, play some pool or just walk
around and see what everyone else is up to.
Remember, doors open!

DO use the lounge. If you live on a ﬂoor

with a communal lounge, take advantage. Take A

some X—Box 360s in and have a ﬂoor-wide
tournament — you know at least four people
on the ﬂoor have one. Build a fort.iPlay poker.
Ifthe mood strikes you, study.

DON’T abuse the lounge. Other people
want to use it, too, and it’s adequately deco-
rated without your empty pizza boxes and
half-eaten chicken wings. Like all community
resources here, you don’t want to ruin it for ev-

eryone else. Remember the rule about having

some class.

Living in the dorms is a new and unusual
lifestyle for almost everyone. Having no one
around to keep you in check might be liberat-
ing, but don’t forget to keep an eye on yourself
-— otherwise you could be in for a long ﬁrst
year.

'Burgl1 a bevy.of

entertaining trivia

by Justin Jacobs
/lrld a/29 E/ztertai/z/nc/zt Editor

You live in Pittsburgh now. Say goodbye
to that little hamlet an hour north or south of
the city or that area “outside Philly” where
you spent 18 years —— this is your new home.

That being the case, it would suit you well
to know a bit about our ﬁne city’s history. No,
I’m not talking about our actual political and
social history — that would be the news edi-
tor’s job to explain. I’m the A&E guy — ‘rath-
er, it’s time to explore Pittsburgh’s past in the
arts. And what a glorious past it is.

1864 —- Steven Foster dies. Oh, Pitts-
burgh, don’t you cry for Steve. One of the
city’s ﬁrst famous musicians, Steven Foster
was the songwriting genius behind “Oh! Su-
sanna,” “Camptown Races” and “Old Folks
at Home (Swanee River).” He’s known as the
father of American music, and he grew up and
lived much of his life right here in Pittsburgh.
Though his work today would have made
him rich, Foster died in New York City with
38 cents in his pocket at the page of 37. Three
plus seven is 10 — exactly the number of let-

‘ ters in the word “Pittsburgh.” Add a heart icon
and you’ve got 11, which is three and eight, »

or 38. Clearly, Steven Foster hearted this city.

1964 4 The Beatles play Pittsburgh,
enough said. While nowadays we’re stuck
with tired acts like Bob Dylan (last fall) and
Tom Petty (this summer) — kidding, kidding
— we had a taste of greatness a few decades
back. The tour, called “The Beatles Show,”
stopped at Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena on a Mon-
day night, and tickets were — getthis — $5.90.
You can’t even buy a beer at a‘ concert forthat

much today, and back then that price got you’

the entire show . . . of The Beatles. Here is just
one example to be tucked away in the‘ “Things
Were Cooler Before We Were Born” ﬁle.

1978 — George Romero releases “Dawn
of the Dead,” starring tons of gross zombies
and the Monroeville Mall. Way back before
we- were born, honor movies were scary
(another example for the ﬁle). At least that’s
what ﬂicks like “The Exorcist,” “The Omen”
and “Night of the Living Dead” would sug-
gest. And three decades ago (as of Sept. 2),
a certain master of horror named George A.

‘ Romero began a Pittsburgh trend that’s lasted
until today: the forever intertwined duo of ,

Pittsburgh and zombies. It was then that he
released “Dawn of the Dead,” the second

zombie movie in his seemingly never—ending ’
series, which began with “Night of the Living '

Dead” and convinced the world that people
from Pittsburgh were cannibalistic half-
corpses and that nearby Monroeville Mall had
some- great sales.

1980 — Christina Aguilera is born. She
shortly thereafter moves to -Wexford and
boosts Pittsburgh’s average talent per person
signiﬁcantly. Though Aguilera was born in
Staten Island, after her parents’ rocky divorce
her mother packed up her sister and her and
moved out west — to Western Pennsylva-
nia, that is. The (eventually) happy trio lived
in Wexford, just outside Pittsburgh, while
Christina rose to local fame —— she sang the
National Anthem at Steelers, Penguins and Pi-
rates games. The girl must have talent to pull
011“ a hat trick like that —— clearly the pinnacle
of her career.

1993 —- Jeff Goldblurn, Pittsburgh native,
stars in “Jurassic Park.” The city starts believ-

ing in dinosaurs. Even Carnegie Museum of _

Natural History has gotten on board — have
you seen “Dinosaurs in Their Own Time?”
Add a few velociraptors and Sam Neil, and
the exhibit is straight out of the movie.

2006 — Sienna Miller refers to our be-

loved Pittsburgh es “S***sburgh.” A city of 
locals is unimpressed. Two years ago when 

the English actress was ﬁlming the still—unre—

leased“MysteriesofPittsburgh”(based on the 1

book by acclaimed Pittsburgh author Michael
Chabon. How ironic.), she defarned the city
in an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine.

The comment caused a minor uproar in the I

media, and Miller laterapologized, hoping for
some sympathy by noting that her father grew
up in Western Pennsylvania. As karma would

have it, Miller’s subsequent releases, includ— 
ing “Interview” and “Stardust,” were both 1
pretty seismic failures: “Stardust,” with a huge “

budget, actually lost $50 million. Clearly, this

proves one solitary and indubitable truth: No 

one messes with Pittsburgh.
2008 —— Bret Michaels, of Butler, Pa,

chooses the groupie of his dreams on “Rock 
_of Love 2.” Yes, that’s right The Aquanet- 
loving, whiskey-swilling, unexplainably and 
apparently attractive Bret Michaels, former 

singer of Poison, is from the area Sure, Butler
is a bit north of Pittsburgh, but the genius who
is Bret Michaels radiates past county lines. The
man responsible for such hits as “Every Rose
Has Its Thorn” and, um‘, several other less
memorable songs in April of this year chose

Ambre Lake to be his rock of love. Given that 
Bret’s average relationship with a fan/woman 
lasts the approximate, time it takes to walk 
from the stage to the tour bus, this is a big step 

for Mr. Michaels. Butler and Pittsburgh, nay,
all of Western Pennsylvania applauds him.
There you have it, a far-from—complete list

of awesome A&E—related Pittsburgh happen— 
ings. Now go forth, new students, and become 

famous, so I have some new ones to write
about next year.

Pittsburgh is not generally viewed as
a fashion capital — at all, really. It’s bet-
ter known as a working class town that’s
idea of fashion is somewhat stuck in the
glory days of the ’70s when the Steel
%urtain reigned supreme and the Pirates
actually had winning seasons. Which
explains why you might see teased
bangs, mullets and other remnants of
this bygone era when Pittsburgh was
known as the “City of Champions.”
We’ve ﬁnally got that one for the
thumb, and Pittsburgh is transform-
ing into a more fashion-friendly city.
While those from Philadelphia or New
York might see our small city as lacking
/selection, I’m here to ‘assure you that
‘there are ample shopping opportunities
in Pittsburgh. With new boutiques crop-
ping up in every neighborhood along
with some new big names entering the
area, there’s sure to be something for
everyone in the Pittsburgh shopping
scene.‘
Pittsburgh shopping is best explained
by breaking it down into neighbor-

hoods, so I’ll list a few hot spots within
bus-riding distance.  '

South Side: A quick bus ride on the
54C or the 59U drops you off in a cool
juxtaposition of old and new, commer-
cialized and independent, ‘ gritty and
glossy shopping areas. The older sec-
tion of the South Side is less commer-
cialized than most modern shopping
centers. Along this more eclectic "and
independent strip of East Carson Street
packed with bars and eateries, trendy
boutiques like Original Cin, Jupe, De-
cade and Pittsburgh Jeans Company
make this area worth a shopping trip or
two. ‘ 0

Southside Works on the other hand, a

newer shopping center with more com?

mercial retailers and a more upscale
feel, features a wide range of stores an-
chored by the Cheesecake Factory and
Southside Works Cinemas. At Southside
Works you can ﬁnd national retailers
United Colors of Benetton, Urban‘ Out-
ﬁtters, Forever 21, American Eagle Out-

ﬁtters, Nine West, Puma, Steve Madden, '

BCBG Max Azria, White House Black
Market, Ann Taylor LOFT, H&M and

Cole Haan, along with local boutique

ate a mecca for dormroom shopping,
while other mall favorites like Express,
Joumey’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Hol-
lister, American Eagle, Victoria’s Se-
cret, Gap‘ and Wet Seal complement
the open—air shopping center. If you’re
a bargain hunter, don’t forget to check
out Marshall’s, Filene.’s Basement and
Old Navy for some cheap but chic ﬁnds.
When you’ve worked up an appetite
from all your shopping, there are plenty
of restaurants to satisfy your tired taste
buds. ‘

Shadyside: Shadyside is a greatplace
if you’re looking for a lmore reﬁned and
upscale shopping experience. The best
shopping in Pittsburgh can be found in
boutiques and Shadyside has no short-

age. Men’s clothing store Moda, wom— s

"City's shopping Choices varied, Stylish  

en’s stores Choices,_ e.b. Pepper, Max:
alto and Pursuits, shoe stores Footloose
and Ten Toes and vintage store Eons are
sprinkled throughout the neighborhood.
Next to these locally owned stores you
may also ﬁnd Banana Republic, Ameri-
can Apparel, J. Crew, Coach, Sephora
and the Apple store. Shadyside is a
refreshing and lovely area to stroll the
streets and’ stop for a bite to eat while
browsing, but you might want to bring
your parents along to foot the bill.
Lawrenceville: If you’re a little
more Joss Stone than Posh Spice, Law-
renceville is a bohemian and up—and-
coming neighborhood in Pittsburgh
with two stand—out stores: Sugar and
Pavement. Sugar owner Katie Bulger
stocks the shelves with local and emerg-
ing designers. A favorite of mine is the,

‘Neighborhood Teaze line, which pokes

fun at Pittsburgh neighborhoods with
slogans like “South Side: No Parking
Available Since 1942” and “Shadyside:
Pastries, Pubs and Preppy Since 1963.”

Pavement offers the latest in shoes
as well as the clothing line Free People
and unique accessories from designers

and artists across the country. Law-

lt’s no secret that college kids are

‘strapped for cash. From necessities like

food and laundry to obligations like books
and school supplies to the fun stuff for
Friday nights, everything costs money.
You enter college and you have to face it:
Life is expensive when you’re a student"

But luckily for Pitt students, there’s a
remedy for some of '/these life expenses.
It’s known as the library, or more speciﬁ-
cally, the Carnegie Library. While you
won’t be. able to alleviate all of your ﬁ-
nancial burdens here — it’s doubtful that
building managers will be pleased to see
you washing your whites in the bathroom
sinks — just about anything school relat-
ed and hordes of things that aren’t can be
found at the Carnegie. All you have to do
is take a little time to explore.

The Carnegie libraries of Pittsburgh
boast 17 locations in and around the city,
so you’re never farther than a short walk
or bus ride to a bountiful selection of
reading materials, videos, music, maps
and_ more. I

The main branch in Oakland is the
hub of the operation. Here you can ﬁnd
‘three ﬂoors of ﬁction, nonﬁction, foreign
language, teen and children’s literature
as well as ‘a substantial selection of pe-

Both an architectural masterpiece and a bastion of literature, the Carnegie Library in
Oakland is a favorite (albeit tucked away) place to sit,,grab ajbook and relax.

 

riodicals and ﬁlms.‘ Should you need a
book for a class paper or one simply for ’
pleasure, you’re sure to ﬁnd it in the vast
expanse of reading materials held within
the aweeinducing stone ediﬁce that is the
Carnegie complex. And if by chance you
don’t ﬁnd it here, you can order it through
the inter—1ibrary loan system. ‘ i
The library, however,‘ is more than
just shelves full of Faulkner and Dickens.
On any given day, there is a myriad of
events taking place to suit palates of all
types. You can write and record your own
song with the MusicMakers series, speak
a little French or help others learn Eng-
lish with Le Club Francophone and Let’s

Great college ﬁeld

trips in City's museums

by Tom VanBuren
A.’/aiata/zt A/‘ta a/13 E/ztertai/2/ne/zt E9£tor

Remember how much fun ﬁeld trips used
to be? You and your friends skipping the
day’s classes, permission slips in hand, and
going to a museum for the sake’ of an activ-
ity that could be —— believe it or not — both
fun and educational. Now that you’re here,
you’ll ﬁnd that Pittsburgh has a wide variety
of destinations for planning your own private
ﬁeld trips — no permission slips required.

Oakland is-the perfect place to start, home
to the Carnegie Museums of Natural History
and Art. Don’t let the “Natural History” name
fool you a this isn’t just some collection of
ancient tree bark and igneous rocks. Your Pitt
ID gets you free admission to dozens of ex-

. hibits.

You can take a trip through ancient Egypt
and see mummies, a rustic canoe and a tomb
fully stocked with burial treasures. Or you
can visit the arctic, complete with polar bears
and walruses. Have you ever wondered what
it would be like inside an igloo? Now you
can ﬁnd out, though the museum’s air condi-
tioning might not accurately reﬂect the tem-
perature inside its replica shelter. -

Yet this museum’s main attraction isn’t
the mummies, nor is it the igloos. It isn’t

even the hall of birds, hard as that may be to 

believe. No, the true crowd pleaser is clear
just by looking at the statue in front of the
building: Folk music artist and Pittsburgh

native Stephen Foster! No, wait, the other ‘
statue in front of the building —— Dippy the

dinosaur!
Dippy the diplodocus stands tall and

— their natural habitats.

the_hall’s renovation of “Dinosaurs in their

of the prehistoric beasts in recreations of

“Dinosaurs in their Tune” also includes
a display’ of not one but two tyrannosaurus
rexes. Experts disagree as to whether or not
these ancient carnivores were predators or
scavengers. Experts do agree, however, that
they were totally awesome.

To see the experts in action, check out the
exhibit’s PaleoLab, a working facility. where
you can watch paleontologists working with
fossils and skeletal remains.

If you prefer historical artifacts of the
manmade variety, adjacent to this museum
is the museum of Art, also ﬁee with your ID.
Here you can visit the Hall of Architecture
or see ﬁrsthand the works of masters like
Pollock, Van Gogh and Picasso.

If Van Gogh’s sunﬂowers bore you,
maybe you’d prefer a Campbell’s soup can.
A trip Downtown — just hop a 500 bus on
Fifth Avenue — will take you to The Andy

a collection of art by Warhol himself, a Pitts-
burgh native and pop artist. For those unfa-

PittArts: cheap Seats
  for great shows

by Colleen Counihan
Staﬁ’ Writer

In celebration of the weekend, a group
of 30-students set out on a cultural excur-
sion through the city. The Friday night
began with free dinnerand dessert at Pitt’s
local Italian restaurant, Joe Mama’s, and

ended, with complimentary seats at one of i

the New Hazlett Theater’s latest modern
dance showings. The event, centered on
an Alice in Wonderland—inspired dance
called Feed Your Head‘ Cafe, also includ-
ed’ a round-trip bus ride for the students

’ and a post-show talk with the artistic ex-

ecutive director of the dance. T
This virtually costless trip is an exam-
ple of what Pitt Arts, a student-friendly

Y organization located on the top ﬂoor of

the William Pitt Union, calls its “Arts _En—
counters,” " or _all—expenses—paid visits to
Pittsburgh’s cultural hot spots.

Kristen Delevich, Pitt junior and neu- .

roscience major, chose to come to Feed
Your Head Cafe. alone, but she believes
these ‘sort of art-related adventures are

’ also meant to be enjoyed with others.

_ ‘“It’s great_for free dates. Just to get
some culture instead of getting stuck in
Oakland — it’s incredibly easy, too,” she
said. “I hadn’t seen a dance through Pitt
Arts yet, it was my last chance" before the
semester was over.” '

During the 2007-08 school year, Pitt
Arts offered 116 of these “Arts Encoun-
ters,” and the number increases every
year. A student gets involved by signing
up on the Pitt Arts e—mail list and then
applying for a spot'_or1‘ thetripsthat suits
one’s personal tastes. '

Annabelle Clippinger, the director at

Pitt Arts,Wtakes pride in the ‘many oppor-

_ tunities her program grants to students;

» “The ﬁrst idea of Pitt Arts is to get peo-
ple off campus and allow them to become
acculturated in the arts, whether it be the
ballet, the symphony or the opera,” she
explained. “But the free arts encounter is
the crown and jewel of the program.”

Though ‘Clippinger notes The Pitts-
burgh‘ Cultural Trust and the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra to be two of the
most commonly, used organizations, each

offering more than 10 ‘shows annually,
_r she is sometimes surprised by the types
of programs students will be most enthu-

siastic about. .

T F “Undergrads'_ love the opera more than
anything,” she said. f‘We’ll have 40 tick-
ets, and 100 people will want to go.”

Pitt freshman Kasia Mikoluk saidrshe
signed up for Pitt Arts within the ﬁrst
week of getting to school.  ?

“You just sign up, come, and you don’t
have to worry about a thing. They choose
the top events in the city, not_uninteresting
choices,” said Mikoluk. “The best part is

t that they get you there —‘ no waiting for
buses.”

The “Arts Encounters” trips are only
a piece of the pie hat Pitt Arts offers,
though. “Cheap Seats” and “Free Vis-
its” are two other programs that students
"take part in when they’re not hitting the
books.

“Cheap Seats” means low—priced tick-
ets for Pitt students, faculty and staff to

performances at Pittsburgh’s cultural.

venues. A student is allowed up to four
tickets per show, and thesecheap seats are
offered by a variety of Pittsburgh organi-
zations, ranging from the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre to the Guitar Society of Fine Arts.
According to Clippinger, Pitt Arts
gave away more than 10,000 cheap seats
this year, an appropriate number since
Pitt Arts was also celebrating its 10th an-
xniversary. 7
The “Free Visits” program also gives
students the chance to attend cultural hot
spots, but in a more “hands-off” fashion.
Sponsored by both Pitt Arts and a variety
of other ‘school organizations, students
are given free access to many‘ of the city’s
museums. _ .
Using their school IDs, Pitt students
- can visit The Andy Warhol Museum, the
Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural
History, the Mattress Factory Art Muse-
um, Phipps Conservatory and the Senator
John Heinz History Center.‘ '
Clippinger said that Pitt Arts receives a
lot of funding from the ofﬁce of the pro-

: vost because the program- gives prospec-

tive students more of a reason to go to Pitt
and stay at Pitt. _ P

“Wehelp the retention rate’ because we ‘

keep students engaged,” she explained
while referencing the highly‘ skewed

number of white females engaged in Pitt‘

Arts to be an example of how far the pro-
gram still has to go. ‘

Clippinger hopes to up thenumber of
males . and increase the involvement of

African Americans, “seeking to really try .

and push’ the boundaries of what ‘multi-
cultural means” for all students.
“We’ve been trying to mix things up a
little,’’ she said. “We want to get every-
- one involved.”

If you’re searching for a logical begin-

njng to Pittsburgh’s expansive art scene, the

North Side’s The Andy Warhol Museum
is a good place to start.

A fearless innovator, Warhol is widely
considered to be the man who made the city
a hub of artistic culture.

The Andy Warhol Museum is the most
comprehensive single—artist museum in
the world. A Pittsburgh native, Warhol re-
shaped the face of the modern art scene by
mass—producing silkscreen canvasses, dis-
carding notions about the mutual exclusiv-
ity of ﬁne art and popular culture. Boasting

V a collection of more than 12,000 works, the

galleries are lined with the eye—popping silk
screens and black and white photographs
that comprise the core of Warhol’s creative
genius.

The museum also includes a kind of"

time capsule, packed with Warhol’s inspi-
rational materials and preliminary sketches,
allowing visitors an opportunity to glimpse
the inner workings of Warhol’s vast imagi-
nation. ‘

The Warhol Museum also regularly hosts
temporary exhibits, displaying the work of
revolutionary artists from around the world.
Currently on display is the work of Dutch
abstract painter, Piet Mondrian. Mondrian
is best known for his Neo—Plasticism move-
ment, which gave birth to the famous “Com—
position with Yellow, Red, Black, Blue and
Grey.” Twenty-eight of Mondrian’s geo-
metrically oriented paintings will be show-
cased at the museum through August 31.

The museum’s vegetarian—friendly base-
ment cafe is the perfect dining experience
to kick off or wrap up your Andy Warhol
experience. ' '

If the contemporary is what you seek,
look no further than Downtown Pittsburgh’s
Wood Street Galleries, which will keep you
on the artistic community’s cutting edge.

 Recently, “Urban Living” came to Wood

Street, offering up ultra—modem environ-
mental and domestic concepts to viewers.

1. Fraught with wires, neon lights and robotic
— dogs, the installations sought to suggest so-
. lutions to urban consumers and homeown-

ers of the future.
Wood Street’s sister gallery, Space, is
also focused in the contemporary. Just a

.' block away from the Wood Street Galleries,

Space is one of the city’s newer artistic fo-

 rums and is currently showcasing art from

seven Pittsburgh locals. Photography by

0? Deborah Hosking and sculptures by Lowry

Burgess and George Lipchak are among the
works that will be on display at “Pittsburgh

All NOW,” which runs through June 13.

Located on Pittsburgh’s North Side, the

Summer, 2008

Mattress Factory Art Museum creates a
space for installation art, which is created
on site by artists from - across the nation.
Room-sized spaces allow artists to envelop
viewers entirely within their visions, creat-
ing a unique sensory experience.

Diverse works from 18 different contem-
porary artists are currently on display at the
Mattress Factory through June 15. Among
the exhibitors is doll maker Jennifer How-
rson,

who has created a childlike dream

world by imagining bowling pins into a for-
ested landscape of white, green and gold:

The Mattress Factory’s 16 permanent
collections include work by Japanese artist
Yayoi Kusama, who works with polka dots
and mirrors to explore the obliteration of the
self. ‘

Once you’ve hit up the city’s better-
known galleries, making a trip to the small-
er hives of Pittsburgh’s art scene can be an
invigorating cultural adventure.

I Popcorn aplenty at
, Pitt's   many theaters

by Andres Miguel
Staﬂ Writer

Like most major cities, the Pittsburgh
landscape is dotted with a wide variety of
movie theaters. Pittsburgh offers a good

balance of huge multiplexes and smaller,_
- more intimate and independent cinemas -

and almost all are easily accessible via the
Port Authority bus system.

Perhaps the largest theater in the area
is the 'AMC Loews at the Waterfront. This
crown jewel of the outdoor mall atthe Wa-
terfront is a sight to behold, looking more
like a palace than a movie theater. The in-
sideisno different, hearkening back to the
days of classic Hollywood with retro archi-

' tecture and -decoration. The theaters them-

selves are quite modern, though — large
and comfortable, even featuring premium
seating. I V  I ..

j ‘Loews offers the most screens of any of

. V. I  E. thetheaters featured in the Pittsburgh area
' " C but "offers little beyond‘ the latest big-name

releases. Occasionally some smaller ﬁlms
will appear there near the end of their runs.
For the car—impaired, a number of buses
will whisk you away to this theatrical ex-
perience: The 59U will take you right to the
front doors, while the 61C", 61D and 61F all
stop right past the bridge hanging over the
Waterfront, within easy walking distance
of Loews. '
The other major theater close to Oakland
is the Southside_Works Cinema at South-
side Works. While not quite‘ as large as
Loews, it is otherwise quite similar, down
to the sprawling interior and comfortable
stadium-seating theaters. However, the the-
ater offers a number of advantages over its
larger competition: On Thursdays it offers
$6 student tickets with a valid school ID.
This theater is nestled in the center of the

Southside Works, a slightly more upscale

outdoor mall than the Waterfront. Trans-

portation is slightly more of an issue. Street ‘

.Plan a romantic date on a student budget

i
!

by Anton Skerl
Staff W/riter 7

Everybody in a relationship has an
idea of a perfect date, and be it candle-
light, a wine—and—dine affair or just
walking through the park, Pittsburgh
has some great places for the “Romeo
and Ju1_iet”-style lovin’ to fully bloom.
For a price.

Let’s face it: We’re college students.

2-.~~..When we’re not shelling out the dough

_;_.for textbooks, it’s going toward a week-
Hnd bender. And unless you’ve got the

msilver spoon dangling from your gob,
. money remains tight. Suddenly you

ﬁnd your date has gone from a hopeful

candlelight‘ romance to sitting in Me-
',onald’s sharing a Big Mac.

 But don’t worry. The perfect date
doesn’t have to drain your wallet. In
fact, many restaurants and sights cater

-.-to the college demographic, ensuring

that you and your signiﬁcant other will
have not only a good time, but also a
surprisingly frugal one. One hint: Your
Pitt ID doubles as a bus pass, so enjoy

free bus trips throughout your college‘

' career.

‘ Take the Spice Island Teahouse on
Atwood Street. It is consistently ranked
as one of the more romantic spots the
’Burgh has to offer. It doesn’t hurt that
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette has rated it
favorably for its charming atmosphere
and inexpensive food. One of the bet-
ter qualitiestis that it’s non—smoking,
slightly dim-lit and BYOB, so you can
bring along some of the bubbly if you’re
celebrating an anniversary.

Or there’s the movie theater, a classic
staple in romances the world over. No
better way to get closer than to cuddle
when the scary moments come up, like
trying to watch Keanu Reeves act.

Two theaters in particular stick out:

the AMC Loews Waterfront Theater ;

and the Southside Works Cinema. Both
are relatively easy to ﬁnd using Google
Maps and offer many restaurants within
their respective vicinities — the Cheese-
cake Factory by Southside Works is of
particular,«yet pricey, interest.

Phipps Conservatory and Botani-
cal Gardens has been listed on about.

7 com as one of the more romantic spots

throughout the city. It has plenty of lush
expanse to make the rainforest sweat

T . and will soon boast even more with the
Completion of its tropical forest conser-—

vatory. A visi.t runs at $9 with your stu-
dent ID.» i '

rently hosting “Chocolate! A Tasty

Summer, 2008

New Exhibit” from now until Novem-
ber, and it’s exactly what it sounds like.
Willy Wonka suggested that chocolate
releases endorphins that produce a feel-
ing similar to love. Besides weddings,
chocolate sounds like the ultimate aph-
rodisiac.

But enough about spending money.
Sometimes the best dates are free —- or
at least close toit.

One spot popular among students
and tanning enthusiasts is the Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial lawn. Boasting

greener grass than the suburbs and a
huge. expanse, why not just take a blan-
ket and a picnic basket? It’s also close
to a 7-Eleven convenience store if you
ﬁnd you need some last minute sup-
plies.

Schenley Park is also popular with
students, boasting 456 acres of green
grass and possibilities including walk-
ing trails and small alcoves that show

off a the immense Pittsburgh scenery. C

One of the best dates I’ve been on was

just walking through the park, shooting .

the breeze as the breeze shot past us. It’s
simple, it’s effective and most of all, it’s
free. ’

But the possibilities for romance in
Pittsburgh are endless. The easiest way
to ﬁnd a nice romantic spot? Just ask
around. Make friends and see what they
do when they feel like making romance.

Finally, look for The Pitt News’ “Besit
‘ of Pitt and the ’Burgh” issue in Novem-

ber. Ranging from the best place to hook
up to the best place to wake up, you’re

' bound to ﬁnd something interesting.

Many students who come to a city college
from a rural hometown do so simply because,
well, there’s just a lot more to do. Similarly,
many students from urban homes do so be-
cause the thought of a tiny college town with

«little more to do than attend com—hole touma-

ments fails to excite. If you fall into either of
these categories, rest assured,«Pitt is the city
school of your dreams, with more to do than
you could ever ﬁt into four years (“So that’s
why some students take ﬁve or six years to
graduate?” you ask. Well, not quite).

At the forefront of the city’s possible ac-
tivities is its vibrant music scene, with -more

bar joints where you’H be able to see some of
the country’s biggest and most well—kr1own

This guide to Pittsburgh’s best music venues
will lead the way. Here goes:

Mr. Smalls Iﬁinhouse, Millvale: This
club, one of the cornerstones of Pittsburgh’s
music scene, is quite literally a godsend.
Converted to a concert hall from a church
not so long ago, Mr. Smalls still holds all the
aesthetics of a house of God, just minus the
pews and, well, any Cruciﬁxes.

. Located at the top of a hill in Millvale, just
across the 40th Street Bridge (check Google
maps), Mr. Smalls can ﬁt up to 650 sweaty
fans, making the club big enough to house
wild dances and brutalmosh pits but small
enough to maintain a truly intimate musical
setting. In addition to a near-perfect atmo-
sphere, Smalls also packs each week with
enough varied and exciting shows that it’s

hard not to ﬁnd something that piques your '

interest This year saw such varied acts as the
Bouncing Souls, Citizen Cope, Dinosaur Jr.,
State Radio and ‘Rusted Root (whose mem-
ber Liz Berlin actually co—owns the club).

I ﬁts in perfectly among the used record shops

and quirky boutiques of the South Side, and
it’s only a bus ride away. Hop on the 54C,
ride down East Carson, and youill eventually
see a classic—looking theater marquee: The

- Rex. Opened as a movie theater more than
.90 years ago, The Rex is not only a place of

rock but also history.

The 550—person wide—open space pro-
vides plenty of room to get down, and you’ll
be amazed how much more of The Rex there
is behind that tiny street—front ticket booth. A
balcony provides some space for those who
can’t take the heat, as the theater often brings
some of the most hardcore acts around to
town, as well as both indie and mainstream
favorites. The Rex hosted acts like Aesop

Go green in Pittsburgh's many parks

by Alison Smyth
Staﬂ H7/'iter

Pittsburgh’s parks create a unique ex-
perience for those who wish to take in all
that Mother Nature has to offer. Point State,
Schenley and Frick parks have not only

your run~,of—the—mi1l park activities but a g

variety of delightfully unusual ones as well.
going green never felt so good.
Downtown’s Point State Park is cur-
rently being renovated in honor of Pitts-
burgh’s 250th anniversary. Construction
is scheduled now through May 2009, and
the end result will be worth the wait. The
improvements will rejuvenate the park and
mold it into the “major center of urban life”
that everyone in the Pittsburgh community
can enjoy. _
Nature lovers will be able to see a con-
cert on a brand new stage and lawn. The

“area is being transformed into a festival

ground and will accommodate vendors and
concessions. This will improve events like
the Three Rivers Arts Festival (coming this
J une), the Three Rivers Regatta and the

Pittsburgh Marathon to Point State Park, as,

patrons will ﬁnally be able to utilize all its

Point State Park, and with the proposed
renovations, cyclists will ride farther than
ever before. Through a series of intercon-
necting bike trails, Pittsburghers will be
able to travel all the way to Washington,
D.C.

The fountain is an attraction that often
draws visitors to the park. This widespread
appeal is understandable, as, amazingly, the
fountain reaches 150 feet in height. It was
dedicated at the completion of Point State
Park by the Commonwealth of Pennsylva-

nia in 1974. For the city’s 250th anniver- .

saiy this year, the Fountain will be restored,
and seating and a touch pool will take the
landmark to a new level.

Point State Park is a historical landmark,
and its history is explored at the Fort Pitt
Museum on its grounds. The museum edu-
cates on frontier history, offers seminars
and hosts presenters on the French and ’In-
dian War. Admission to the museum is $5,
and it remains open, during" construction.

Another historical attraction.‘  Point

lie, and admission is free.

Schenley Park has the usual park fare
and more. Located on the borders of Oak~
land and Squirrel Hill, it might be the clos-
est option for Pitt students looking to get in
touch with nature — or just ﬁnd a spot to
relax. The park has its share of bike and hik-
ing trails, and it also -houses a public pool.
A lake adds to the picturesque scenery. The
Schenley Park,Golf Course is a sporting
option for those who do not wish to take
advantage of the cycling, swimming, jog-
ging or hiking.

Schenley Park is set apart from Pitts-
burgh’s other parks with its unique events.
There are movies screened every Wednes-
day and Sunday night on Flagstaff Hill, and
the park hosts the Race for the Cure and the
Vintage Grand Prix.

The park has an iceéskating rink, which
is a popular whiter activity for Pittsburgh
students. There are theme skates, like last
year’s Mascot Skate, Skate with Santa and
Valentines on Ice. There are special college
ID discounts on certain days, which shave
a dollar off the regular admission price.
Schenley Park’s varied seasonal and year-

round activities are sure to please any visi-

tor or Pittsburgh native.

Like Pittsburgh’s other parks, Frick
Park has your garden—variety nature activi-
ties. Patrons can hike,—bike and swim in the
public_swimming pool. There are even ten-
niscourts for a change of pace. The park’s
Blue Slide Playground is perfect for your
visiting younger siblings or for yourself if
you feel» like a day at the playground for old
time’s sake. ' T

One of Frick Park’s most interesting
attractions is Frick Park Bowling Green.
The public lawn bowling green is the only

one in Pennsylvania. The Frick Park Lawn .
Bowling Green Club offers free lessons to‘

beginning bowlers, if you would like to
leam how to play without those inﬂatable
blockers in the gutters. The bowling green
has eight lanes and a clubhouse, perfect for
any aspiring bowler.

Point State, Frick and Schenley parks
make Pittsburgh a unique place to live.
Other cities have parks, but few hold within
them the wonderful and unusual amenities
that our parks offer. Where else but Pitts-
burgh can one ﬁnd a bowling green, ice
rink, weekly outdoor movie screening and
historical museums? These parks might be
green, but the activities they offer to Pitts-
burgh residents are pure gold.

Strategic spots for studying sessions

by Dan Vetanovetz A
Staff Wrtler

Make studying adventurous this year

by stepping out of the normally packed
destinations.

During midterm and ﬁnals week espe-
cially, the normal haunts for Pitt students
are quickly inundated with cramming stu-
dents. Destinations like Hillman Library
and the Cathedral of Learning become
packed, and the subsequent increase in
noise can be brain deafening. , '

What most students don’t know about
are possibilities a little farther away, in-

cluding coffee shops and even Camegie
_ Mellon Universi_ty’s campus. '

Frequently, students will gather around
sources of caffeine. Rather than giving up
hope after failing to ﬁnd a seat in the main-
stays, students might instead try destina-

tions a little farther out. i

Foremost of these are Crazy Mocha’
South Side location, 61C Cafe in Squir-
rel Hill or Coffee Tree Roasters in either

i Shadyside or Squirrel Hill.

Crazy Mocha in the South Side features

 a shop more expansive and moodily lit
‘ ‘than its Oakland branch but with the fa-

miliar quirkiness in its drink selection and
varied food options, from cookies to veg-
etarian sandwiches.

WiFi is also available for students who

 are as dependent on the Intemet as they are

on calfeine. Crazy Mocha has a wide ar-

-. ray of additional Pittsburgh locations with
- another close one in Shadyside.

61C Cafe, a Squirrel Hill cultural ﬁx-

 ture since 1993, serves up espresso in a
‘ more traditional marmer. Students will ﬁnd
’ enjoyment in ﬁnding a seat next to the fog-
; gy windows in winter months with a mild
ye latte and a copy of Kant’s “Critique of Pure
.5 Reason” as easily as a chemistry textbook.
 In addition to ﬁne baked goods, 61C offers
' free W1Fi. ' —

The Coffee Tree—Roasters is another

_' excellent coffee vendor to settle into for
‘ extended studying time. VV1th the scent
_ of a diverse selection of coffee roasts and
? ﬂavors hanging in the air, it’s easy to drift
A‘ away while sitting at the snug tables and
ii Chairs arranged across the cafe. Offering
' free WiFi and baked goods of their own,
7 both Roasters locations are sure to meet
i students’ needs.

Students hoping for something a little

‘ closer to campus could try places adjacent
' to Schenley Plaza , .

Although the Frick Fine Arts building

 is on the right track, its seating is limited,

and savvy arts majors know how excellent

 of a place it is for studying. In the event
‘ that all its high-value study seats are tak-

Summer, 2008

en, "students can jump across the bridge to

. Phipps, which has a cafe of its own. More

importantly, students can go into the botan-
ical gardens for free with a Pitt ID, and it’s

. amazing how refreshing it can be to stroll

through the greenhouses for a study break.
The Carnegie Library is another ex-
cellent place to study, where students can
slip into nooks hidden throughout inside.
In addition to studying inside a historical
philanthropic‘ cornerstone, students will
ﬁnd the erudite atmosphere encouraging to
studying even subjects like economics.

iWith the extent of cooperation between
Pitt and CMU, including the opportu-
nity for students at one institution to take
courses at the other through cross registra-
tion, it seems natural that we should share
studying locations, too. However, students
rarely utilize their neighboring campuses.

Conveniently, CMU ﬁnals week for the
spring semesterbegins more than a week
after Pitt ﬁnals haveended. Pitt students
looking for a place to study the week be-
fore ﬁnals might instead try ﬁnding a desk
or table in CMU’s ﬁnals—removed Hunt Li-

brary, located at the back of the mall on its
campus. Its vertical exterior columns are

‘ coincidentally Hillrnan-esque but are made‘

of steel rather than concrete. Although
Hunt’s ﬂoors are smaller than Hillman’s,
there are more of them, and each one is
packed with desks and tables. One ﬂoor is
even designated for quiet studying.

c There are still other options available“
for students, but the only way to ﬁnd them
is to explore a little. A lack of good plac-
es _to study is a pretty lame excuse when
you’re a student in Oakland.

Study abroad Without
leaving the Cathedral

by Katie Blemler
Staﬂ "Writer

The Cathedral of Learning _— the epicenter
of Pitt’s campus — distinguishes the Univer-
sity not only nationally but also internationally.
The Cathedral remains the tallest educational
building in the United States at 535 feet. It
stands only second in height to Moscow State
University’s main building, which -is more than
787 feet tall. . --

The 42-story building exists today thanks to
the vision and determination of John G. Bow-
man. Bowman, chancellor of Pitt from 1921 to
1945, led the proposal to build on a then-vacant
14-acre plot of land, called Frick Acres. He was
aiming to create a building Pittsburgh natives
would be proud of and, as a result, send their
children to college while staying in the city.

‘ Bowman used his determination to gain
support from local residents in ﬁinding for the
proposed building. More than 1000 Steelwork-
ers, their families,  and schoolchil-
dren contributed to the plan. Although each
donated small amounts, collectively Bowman
raised the necessary $10 million to begin con-
struction.

In 1926 Bowman’s dream became a reality T

as_ development of the Cathedral commenced

‘Upon its completion in 1937, the Cathedral

stood tall with its Gothic—inspired exterior. The
interior of the massive building celebrates the
cultural diversity of Pittsburgh with its Nation-

‘ ality Rooms.

The Nationality Rooms represent unity
among Pittsburgh residents who immigrated
to the city from all across the world The class-
rooms symbolize the different. cultures that
contributed unique ﬂairand ﬂavor to the city in
the late 18th century.

The rooms were not only embraced with
enthusiasm in Pittsburgh, but as news spread

' across seas, international supporters lent archi-

tects and materials to add to each Nationality
Room’s authenticity. '

_Each room is dedicated to a speciﬁc nation,
and the contents of each clearly mirror those in
the actual countries. The Nationality Rooms

1 ﬂourished under the leadership of Ruth Craw-

ford Mitchell, who oversaw the production of
17 rooms upon her retirement in the late ’50s.
The 19 -year span from 1938 to 1957 saw the

~ creation of. 19 rooms in total, with seven more

between 1987 and 2000. y _ o

- Crawford ’s successor, Maxine Bruhns, now
directs the Nationality Rooms and Intercultural
ExchangePrograms. Bruhns held this position

The current 26 Nationality Rooms are
housed on the ﬁrst and third ﬂoors of the Cathe-
dral, with the majority outlining the perimeter
of the entire ﬁrst ﬂoor.

The cultures represented by National-
ity Rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor include Chinese,

Czechoslovakian, English, French, German, in A

Greek, Irish, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian,
Polish, Romanian, Russian, Scottish, Swedish,
Yugoslavian and Sy1ian—Lebanon (which -is
one of the two disp1ay—only rooms). '

Those on the third ﬂoor are the African,
Armenian,.Austrian, Hungarian, Indian, Israeli,

Japanese,’ Ukrainian and Early American (the '

other display—on1y room) rooms.
. The newest addition, the Welshroom, is set
to open by June 1. The Welsh room is to be fol-

‘ lowed by eight additional rooms.
Along with the Welsh classroom, those to .

come include Danish, Finnish, Korean, Latin
American, Filipino, Swiss, Thai and Turkish
rooms. ‘

Each classroom encompasses distinct char-
acteristics native to each culture. For example,
the Austrian Nationality Room includes Ro-
man mythology ceiling paintings ' and two
hanging chandeliers.

The German classroom is made almost en-
tirely from walnut and oak, of which much is ,
carved or painted, and also boasts stained-glass
windows.

The Greek classroom is a vibrant red with
a single long table replacing individual desks. ‘

Students in the Greek classroom sit upon 

wooden chairs carved with names of Greek
islands and towns and are surrounded by au— :
thentic columns. Perhaps the most impressive

aspect of the Greek room lies inits colfered -
ceiling — made up of a collection of omarnen— 1.

tal tiles decorated with a sunburst pattern.

’ The Indian classroom is unique in its setup 

as the desks are concentrated along the ‘outside 
of the classroom, unlike the setup of typical }

classrooms where the desks are aligned in the 

middle of the room. The walls and ﬂoor of the V
Indian classroom are made entirely of brick, 
which is also a distinct characteristic. H I
As these four rooms show, each National-
ity Room required intense research and -labor
in order to achieve authenticity. The designs of
each act as succinct replicas of typical class-
rooms from each nation. ‘
Since all but two ofthese rooms areusedto

hold classes, many lucky students can actually _ 

learn from inside one of these unique rooms.

Each is breathtaking in its own way. The

breakfast? Of course you have, and The War-
hol is the place to see all that and more. Slight-
ly less abstract are Warho1’s famous prints of
icons like Marilyn Monroe and Mick Jagger,
all on display in a tribute to the pop culture
that fascinated Warhol and inspired his art.

You’ve seen bones. Architecture. War-
hol. But it’s all old, passe — you want to see
something by a living artist. What if the art,
however, was the living artist himself? Tom
Sarver has opened the doors of his home to
museurn—goers, offering up his daily activi-
ties as art —— though it isn’t as mundane as
it sounds. Sarver’s house,_ dubbed The Tom
Museum, features puppets, paintings and pa-
per chains as parts of an engaging and theat-
rical experience. Part museum and part fun
house, The Tom Museum is guaranteed to be
unlike any art exhibition you’ve seen before.

Now» you’re getting into the deep philo-
sophical stuff. What about the left—brainers
out there, though, just looking for a good time
with something less abstract than experimen-
tal puppet shows? Look no further than the
Carnegie Science Center, located next door
to Heinz Field. The Science Center combines
fun with education — yes, it’s possible — with
activities like tours of a submarine and hands-
on experiments with rockets, lasers and wind.

Even though you don’t ride the big yel-
low school bus anymore, and attending el-
ementary school didn’t require thousands of
dollars in loans each year, you can still get a
bit nostalgic and-take yourself out on a good
old—fashioned ﬁeld trip.

night owls, the library closes most days
at 8 p.m., other days at 5 p.m. — or even
search the catalog should you want to
make sure they have the book you want
before you trek to check it out.

By the time ﬁnals come around, Hill-
man will be packed with overstressed co-
eds cramming for their tests, so if you’re
seeking some refuge from the maelstrom
of madness, the Oakland branch is a good
option._Crazy Mocha nestles a little cof-

each branch has computers with Internet

‘ On the other hand, if you’re tired of
staring at Oakland all'day,~head on out to

the Squirrel Hill branch. The renovated‘

library is smaller than the one in Oakland,

' but it provides a bright, modern feel and

lots of open space for studying. Two walls
with ﬂoor—to—ceiling windows and wide,

cushioned seats allow you to overlook the

bustling Forbes and Murray intersection .

the latest Rolling Stone.

Granted, you’re, not privy to all this
marvelousnessof the library unless you
procure that magic little library card. For
those students who live on campus, go to
the ground ﬂoor desk at Hillman Library
where they can print out a sheet conﬁrm-
ing your address in the city. For those stu— .
dents who live off campus, simply take in
a utility billor a piece of ofﬁcial mail with
your Pittsburgh address on it and they will
issue you a card. Once you receive that, ‘
you’re golden. The card allows you ac-

College can mean a lot of things, most
of them cool, some of them scary, one of

check the bus before you get on.

The Squirrel Hill area offers two smaller
but more easily accessible theaters. Featur-
ing only four theaters, the Manor Theater
on'Murray Avenue is among the smallest
in the city. However, it is one of the few ha-
vens for smaller releases and independent
ﬁlms in Pittsburgh and is signiﬁcantly less.
expensive than the multiplexes. The other
is the Squirrel Hill ‘Theater, only a few
blocks further down on Forward Avenue,
which offerssix theaters and a slightly more
mainstream selection. The theaters in both
are somewhat small but clean and of decent

quality. The best part is the easeof access ,
/. to these theaters — any of the 61 buses will

stop at Forbes and Murray, within ‘walking

‘distance of both theaters, and the 61C, 61D

and 61F in particular will stop steps away
from the Squirrel Hill Theater. "
Finally, the smallest theaters in Pitts:

for city's film buffs

‘burgh — each showing only a single ﬁhn

at a time — are a trio of theaters run by
the Pittsburgh Filmrnakers. The Melwood
Screening Room is close to campus in
North Oakland. The Harris Theater is in
the heart of Downtown, accessible by al-

at the branches that

most any bus going down FifthiAvenu,e. 

Finally, the Regent Theater is probably -the f

least accessible of the three — you’ll have
to get on any of the 67 line of buses and
make a signiﬁcant walk. The ﬁlms showing '
at -these theaters change quite frequently
and are almost neverimainstream releases.
The theaters show everything from student
ﬁlms to independent releases to time—hon—
ored classics. Schedules are available at

Pittsburgh offers something for every—

as football, but you need to put in a re-
quest for a ticket before you can actual-

need to go to the earlier games in order
to acquire loyalty points. Although, it
is very common that someone who has
never been to a game can get a ticket

Last year, running back Mc-
Coy thrust himself into the mid-

a freshman. He astonished fans
with his quickness and ability to
evade would-be tacklers.

McCoy ﬁnished his rookie
campaign with 1,375 yards and
14 touchdowns, which broke the
school record for rushing touch’-
downs by a freshman, previously
held by Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett.

Along with fellow running

the Panthers’ rushing attack
should lead the offense once

By now it’s old news.

Everyone knows about Pitt
football’s 13-9 win at West
Virginia last season. And most
know that the defense spear-
headed the charge in that game.

Returning is nearly the entire
Pitt defense, which was ranked
among the best in the country
throughout almost all of last
season.

Leading that ‘defense is line-
backer Scott McKillop, a pre-
season All-American selection.

With such a strong defense
returning, it’s going to be up to
the offense to get the team mov-

Tourney success

by Tony Ferraiolo

Pitt basketball is headed to-
ward uncharted territory. An
improbable run through the Big
East tournament brought lofty
expectations to Pitt entering
last year’s NCAA Tournament.
Different, however, from the
type it will face entering next
season.

The Panthers ripped off four
wins in four days at Madison
Square Garden to become just
the second team to accomplish
the feat (Syracuse also did it in
2006). As a No. 7 seed in the
Big East tournament, Pitt beat
three ranked opponents on its
way to capturing Big East hard-
ware, in the process perking up
Panther perception throughout
the country.

However, a little pressure
comes with that type of hype.

Although Pitt is known for
its men’s basketball dominance,
a little—known tidbit slipped
through the cracks in Oakland’s
sidewalks this March.

The women’s basketball
team was better.

After taking quite a while to
gain respect on a national scale,
the Panthers won their way to
prominence in the 2007-08 sea-
son.

One year after advancing to
its ﬁrst ever NCAA Tournament
and winning its ﬁrst game, Pitt
made a run to the Sweet 16 be-
fore falling to eventual runner-
up Stanford.

Coach Agnus Berenato’s
Panthers achieved the‘ most
successful season in program
history, going 24-11 and ﬁnish-
ing No. 16 in the national rank-
ings.

, Included in those 24 victo-
ries were Big East tournament

triumphs over Villanova and
Notre Dame and tough wins
against Wyoming and Baylor in
the NCAA tournament.

Seniors Marcedes ‘Walker
and _Mal1orie Winn provided
leadership and results for the
young Panthers.

Walker, a 6—foot-3 center,
averaged 13.6 points and 9.4
rebounds per game in her ﬁnal
campaign. Her presence in the
middle drew added attention
and opened up the outside game
for point guard Winn and shoot-
ing guard Shavonte Zellous.

Zellous’ jump shot took over
several games by itself. The red-
shirt junior paced the Panthers
in scoring with 18.2 points per
garne.'Zellous’ ability to create
her own shot was vital in many
of the team’s victories.

When Zellous performed her
best, Pitt won games. During
the club’s season-high ll—game
winning streak in December
and January, Zellous scored at

1 by Nick LaMantia 1
Staff Wrz'ter

Pittsburgh sports teams have seen as
many ups and downs in the past 10 years
as Danny Bonaduce’s acting career. _

Pittsburgh fans have seen their favor-
ite teams suffer through near relocations,
years of failure and periods of inconsisten-
cy as well as the building of new stadiums,
an inﬂux of young talent and champion-
ship seasons. 1

lVILB
The baseball_ team in the region, the
Pittsburgh Pirates, has been the most dis-
appointing of the city’s storied black—and-
gold franchises. ,
Part of the ’Burgh since the 1880s, the
Pirates have held a losing record for 15
consecutive seasons. This one isn’t look-

ing too promising, as their se1f-proclaimed '

strength — the pitching — has been every-
thing except Mr. Olympia.

The Pirates have some productive
young players, such as Nate McLouth and
Ryan Doumit, but the team needs to decide
whether it wants to trade stars Jason Bay
and Xavier Nady. ,

They have been rebuilding for as long
as they have owned a losing record. One
would think they ‘should have quite the
skyscraper of talent, but instead, with ev-
ery few losing seasons comes new man-
agement and more demolition.

Will new _manager John Russell and
general manager Neal Huntington be any
different from the past regimes?

Who knows, but there surely will be an-
other foundation built.

NFL

The Steelers, on the other hand, have
been the staple for consistency the past 40
years. They’ve had only three head coaches
during that span and have won ﬁve world
championships, the most recent coming in
2005 underlprevious coach Bill Cowher.

Cowher has since retired, and Mike

“Dude,” _I said to my friend,
after I hugged some other kid,
“Greg Lee is on pace to catch

My dad was there, too. My

in the nosebleeds (he likes to
watch the whole play develop
from atop his perch), he saw it
from the same angle. V

“That was easy,” he thought.
“Maybe they are as good as
people think they are.”

Pitt was then ranked No. 23
in the preseason, coming off a
Big East championship and a
BCS bowl. Palko-‘to-Lee might
as well have been Young-to-
Rice. I .

Seven points into the sea-
son, Pitt was building a pro-
gram stronger than the Nile is
long.

,“Then,” as my dad deadpans
years later, “the dam broke.” -

The final score:
Notre Dame. Pitt’s 2005 sea-
son record: 5-6.

It was tough on all of us. I
called my dad after the third

quarter of that fateful game

against Brady Quinn and the

 9‘

Pretty Boys. v

“I don’t want to be here
anymore,” Isaid.

He paused on the other end.

“Neither do I.”

The next year, the 2006 sea-
son that Pitt opened 6-1, it fin-
ished 6-6. _ .

The things I did to vent
my frustration made Darrell
Strong’s “obscene gesture” to
South Florida fans look like a
thumbs, up. ’

This‘ past season, per my
mom’s request, my dad moved
their season tickets.from the
upper decks to the lower level.

Back down to Earth — where
the Pitt program“ settled before A

a 13-9 spectrum in the Mor-
gantown, W. Va., sky launched
high hopes for Pitt football yet
again.

Thus goes the cycle. And
as an incoming Pitt fan, you’ll
know it better than any of the

generic .gen—ed material you’ll _

inevitably be forced to memo-
rize.

See, I’ve had it this way my

' entire life. My dad went ‘to Pitt.

My mom got her teaching mas-
ter’s from Pitt. They were both
here the last time the Panthers
won a national champion-
ship — in 1976, in the thick of
Pittsburgh’s glory days.

It seems like I was born
wearing a royal blue Pitt sweat-
shirt, which switched to navy
blue in 1997, which I wore on
the field in 1998 when Pitt lost
to Temple.

Think about that.

Remember Matt Lytle? If
you do, you get it.

L If you don’t, well, you don’t
want to get it.

But you just might. One

_ thing I’ve learned over the

years is to never be surprised.
With anything any Pitt sports
team does. For familiarity’s

sake, I’ll say “expect the unex-

pected.”

I use football as my main
example because Pitt football
is my favorite team anywhere.

    

Are you a Pitt fan? Prepare to be surprised

I’ll watch Pitt over the Steelers,
and anybody who grows up in
Pittsburgh knows the gravity
of that enthusiasm or concern
or love, whatever it is.

That said, I’ve followed this
program for years and have
been there through times both

murky and clear. And believe ,

me, there have been plenty of
both.’

But for every loss to Ohio,
there’s a historical upset of the
No. 2 team in the country on
its coronation night. Your bit-
ter rival speechless — there’s
no better feeling.

Mike McGlynn was right, if
a bit jazzed on that cool night
in Morgantown. '

“We shocked the world,” he  

said. V '
And we did. Maybe not the
whole world, but our world.
It’s certainly not the first
time, and I know it won’t be

u the last. Pitt will shock our
‘world once again. And again.

And" again.

Past Panthers ﬁnding glory in professional leagues

by Zack Chakan
‘/laazlatant Sparta Eaitor

Budding stars like LeSean
McCoy and Sam Young will
showcase their talents in the
upcoming year for Pitt’s sports
teams.

In the seasons to come, Pan-
ther fans might follow their
progress in the professional
realm and watch them excel at
the highest level possible.

But McCoy and Young won’t
stand alone. Pitt develops some
of the ﬁnest athletes in the coun-
try year after year, with the NFL
standing out as the primary resi-
dence for professional Panthers.

Here are some of the Pitt al-
ums who currently collect their
paychecks in the ranks of the
elite.

Larry Fitzgerald (Wide Re-
ceiver, Arizona Cardinals)

Topping the list as the pre-

' mier Pitt Panther in professional

sports, Fitzgerald delivered an

two seasons in Pittsburgh.

‘ After a year at prep school,
Fitzgerald enrolled at Pitt in
2002 and paid immediate divi-
dends in the squad’s passing
game.

‘In only two seasons, Fitzger-
ald caught 161 passes for 2,677
yards and 34 touchdowns.

All of his numbers rank near
the top of Pitt’s all—time list,_ and
had he remained in school, most
of the receiving records would
have fallen.

Fitzgerald ﬁnished second
in the Heisman Trophy voting
in 2003 and was drafted by the
Cardinals with the third pick in
the 2004 NFL Draft.

The 6—foot—3—inch wideout
played his way into two Pro
Bowls in his four—year career
and has twice eclipsed the 100-
catch mark.

This past season, Fitzgerald
tallied 100 receptions for 1,409
yards and 10 touchdowns.

At only 24 years of age,

rise and, if he keeps up the tor-
rid pace of his early years, he
might have a Hall of Fame ca-
reer ahead of him.

Darrelle Revis (Comer-
back, New York Jets)

The ﬁrst-round selection of
the New York Jets in the 2007
NFL Draft, Revis enjoyed a pro-
ductive rookie season in New
York’s secondary.

Revis totaled 87 tackles
while forcing one fumble and
grabbing three interceptions.
He also recorded 17 passes de-
fended.

NFL analysts love Revis’

. potential and believe he could

wind up in a Pro Bowl in the
near future.

At 5—foot-11 and a shade
more than 200 pounds, Revis
has exemplary cover skills on
the outside.

After attending nearby Al-

iquippa High School, Revis.

lasted three years at Pitt before

All-Big East selection as a soph-
omore in 2005 and a Rivals.com
third—team All-Americem as a
junior.

Gerald Hayes (Linebacker,
Arizona Cardinals)
Hayes emerged as a produc-

Itive starting linebacker for Ari-

zona the past two seasons after
sitting out in 2005 with a knee

injury.

  
 

A third-round draft choice in
2003, Hayes joined his former
college teammate Fitzgerald in
the southwest. E

While starting his career on

' special teams and as a primary
backup, Hayes broke out in

2006. with 93 tackles and three
interceptions.

Hayes built on that season
with an improved 2007 cam-
paign that featured 98 tackles

In 10 years as Panthers skipper, Jor-
dano and the Pitt baseball team have only
had two losing seasons. More frequently,
Jordano experiences Big East touma—

P ments, hanging strong amid the top of the
conference and leading his teams to some

« _ ,.the most successful seasons in the pro-

’ m,’s history. _ .

Even with a 2008 campaign. that has

, 11 many injuries and a losing record,

 grdano won’t let his team lay down.

if , ‘_We’re not satisﬁed with where we’re

- at._=today,” said Jordano. “But we’re out

1,. pounding the pavement everyday and

 
 
  
 
  
 

 fjght way.”
A. That never-say-die attitude exempli-
gﬁes a Panther baseball program that J or-
 dano has helped to establish as one of the
best in the Big,East year in andyear out.
Despite playing on what Jordano calls
; "the worst facility in the conference, the
. program has turned out ﬁve 30—win sea-
sons in the past decade, has been nation-
ally ranked three times and last year sent
six of its players to the professional level,

working to represent the University in the p

category, hopes to join those four once
his career at Pitt is up.

Though he has enjoyed an illustrious
span on the diamond, starting nearly ev-
ery game in his four years, Conley has
also enjoyed an evolution off the ﬁeld.

“Each year I can feel myself grow-

I ing and becoming a better person,” said

Conley, who loves the tight—knit com-
munity that permeates Oakland.‘ “Every-
one on campus seems like they’re you’re
friend.”

And Conley isn’t alone in his love for
the Pitt community. Danny Lopez, who
was lured to play for the Panthers from
Queens, N.Y., agrees that the welcoming
atmosphere only helps the team,,encour-
aging them to work even harder on the
ﬁeld.

I “I was accepted right away,” said the‘

shortstop, who is dedicated to academics
in addition to his work on the ﬁeld, feel-
ing a strong responsibility to represent his
teammates well through good behavior
and grades.

Jordano landed recruits like Conley

Women’s tennis

_Last season, the women’s tennis
 beat its bitter rival West Virginia
 the first time in team history:

P’ Then, when it came down to the
’__«e, the Panthers beat the Mountain-
 once again to finish ninth in the
 East Championships.
 It was Pitt’s highestplacing ever.
And aside from winning for the first

 
  
  
  
 

i  against West Virginia, Pitt won

t‘vi,/:o_matches at the championship event
for the first time. -

, Returning for her fourth season is ”

standout Kristy Borza, who owns the
»school record for career wins. She’ll

 to -lead the team to even more

fiists in the upcoming season.

7.'f_ Coach George Dieffenbach just fin-

ished his‘ 31st season guiding the Pan-

L thers.

C “We have a strong nucleus, and our

C top four are coming back,” said Dief—

fenbach. “This year We’ll have the most
challenging schedule in the history of
the school, playing more Big East teams
than ever (nine). We’ll try to work hard

 and stay intense and continue to ex-
, eel.”

Men’s and women’s soccer
The men’s soccer team just couldn’t

~i put it all together last year.
But after finishing its season with a

win against Marquette and returning a

. solid group of young players, there’s
' hope to improve upon a 3-13-2 record.

Forward E.J. McCormick, one of the
key players on the Pitt roster, returns

._ for his senior year after leading the

Panthers with four goals last season.

The women’s team recently finished‘
~ up its spring season with an undefeated
' record of 4-0-1 and 10 goals scored.

It was the best record the team has‘
 had since coach'Sue-Moy Chin arrived ~
3 five years ago.

That might have’ been expected, since

. the Pitt ladies lost just three players to

graduation.
Ashley Habbel returns for her junior

E Year after scoring six goals in the fall.

She’s joined by senior Jennifer

, Kritch, who scored five goals on the
season.

Volleyball looks to rebound after missing championships

Swimming and diving

After enjoying great success last
season, the Pitt swimming and diving
teams look to return for an even bigger
season next year. "

At the 2008 Big East Champion-
ships, the men (10-4) placed third and
the women (11-3) ended fourth over-
all.

Returning for his senior season will _

be"diver Alex Volovetski, the reigning
Big East Most Outstanding Diver and
 East champion in both the one— and
thifee-meter diving events.

:After placing eighth in the NCAA
Championships in March, Volovetski
became just the fifth Panther of all
time to be named All—American.

{Captains Stacie Safritt and Ruth
Seiffert, both seniors, continually con-
tributed to last year’s season.

Safritt led with several multiple-win
meets against Virginia, Cincinnati and
Notre Dame. 1

.i§Seiffert was named “Performer of
the Meet” against West Virginia, placed
ninth overall at the Big East Champi-
onships in the 200—meter breaststroke
and won the 100—breaststroke at the
ECAC Championships.

Additional talent can be found in
the underclassmen with Andrzej Dubi-
el and Cookie McIntyre, both of whom
garnered second— and fourth—place fin-
ishes in their first Big East Champion-
ship meets.

Gymnastics .

, Pitt’s Gymnastics team is returning
all but two members of last season’s
roster.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
they’re leaving behind two athletes
who competed at the NCAA Regional
meet during this past season.

Sophomores Molly Moyer and

Shannon Vafiadou both had their best. 1

events on the ﬂoor exercises at their

_ first NCAA Regional meet, registering '
\ scores of 9.675 and 9.625.

Next season, senior Anya Chayka,
the reigning East Atlantic Gymnastics
League champion, will join them in the
balance beam event. -

Cross Country

Pitt lost five seniors at the end of this
Past season, leaving the cross country
team hobbled. Still, there’s a lot of tal—_
ent in the underclassmen.

Joshua Christopher, now a sopho-
more, led the team last year. Chris-
topher came in fourth in his first two

‘meets at the collegiate level and was

the first Panther across the finish line
at every meet last season.

Christopher finished 71st overall at
the NCAA Championship meet.

Anna Yoney, also a sophomore, re-
turns to continue her successful career
in running at Pitt.

Last year Yoney turned in several
high—scoring races for the Panthers,
including a 46th—place finish at the
NCAA Championships.

Track and Field

, The track and field team loses sev-
eral key seniors, including Pitt’s two
All-Americans, Mike Wray and Sam
Bair.

Both took home gold to help the»

Panthers to a seventh—place finish in
the Big East Indoor Championships
last season.

The women’s track team earned a
fifth—place finish at the Big East Indoor
Championship meet thanks to members

Janessa Murphy and Mycaiah Clem-
ons, both of whom return this coming
year.

Women’s Volleyball

Women’s volleyball started on a tear
last season but missed a berth in the
Big East Championships after a disap-
pointing second half.

This season, coach Chris Beerman’s
team is looking forward to change.

Who says you haveto be on a Divi-
sion I team to be a competitive athlete?

N 0 one.

Pitt offers a variety of club sports for
dedicated athletes who don’t want the
pressures or demanding commitments
required. of students in big—time univer-
sity athletics.

Men’s rugby captain Andrew Mlynar-
ski said that iswhat got him going.

“Playing a club sport is a great way
for former high school athletes to stay

active without the pressures of a Divi-~~

sion I schedule,” said Mlynarski.

The Pittclub teams travel around the
nation to compete with other teams at
other schools. _ .

For some, the competition against bit-
ter rivals is the best thing to do. -

Former Pitt defenseman and current
Pitt ice hockey coach Toki Barron said
there are many reasonsto join the clubs.

“One of the biggest beneﬁts of play-
ing in a club is that you get to represent
Pitt against other teams at rival schools
like Penn State and West Virginia,” he

said.

Club sport teams have competitive
edges, ﬂexible schedules, and for some,
no experience is necessary. The key to
becoming part of a team is to know your
options. V

Pitt club sports include, but are not
limited to, men’s and women’s lacrosse,
men’s and women’s soccer, ice hockey,
ﬁeld hockey, rugby, ultimate Frisbee,

'vo1l‘ey‘ball“an‘d baseball.

The men’s and women’s lacrosse
teams are loaded with competitive play—'
ers.

Women’s lacrosse captain Margo
Goldberg is one of them. ‘

“We’re very competitive, and we look
for people who "love the sport,” she said.

The women’s lacrosse team has been

to nationals three of the past four years.

This past year they won regionals, and
they often place in the top 10.

The men’s lacrosse team is also a top-
ranked team.

Men’s and women’s soccer make up
two other competitive squads.

The men’s soccer. team travels the
northeast regionand has qualiﬁed for the
regional conference the past three years.

Also, let Forbes Avenueftsiiiteseiliéiiow you are t

Both the men’s and women’s teams look
for experienced players who like to stay
active and practice hard.

On the ice, the men’s hockey team
ranked No. 24 in the nation out of more
than 150 teams in the American Colle-
giate Hockey Association. The team’s
accomplishments are a combination of
on— and off-the—ice preparations.

Anyone interested in sports manage-

ment, athletic training or playing is wel— ,

come to take part in any of the many di-

. visions of the team.

The Pitt ﬁeld hockey team hangs on
thelist as well. Like many of the club
teams, the ﬁeld hockey team practices at
the Cost Center, which is just north of
the Petersen Events Center.

As competitive as any sport, ﬁeld
hockey provides a great opportunity for
students at Pitt. Since the University
doesn’t sponsor a varsity team, the club
hockey team is all Pitt has.

Other intense ‘ﬁeld action includes
the men’s and women’s rugby teams.

the men’s team won two tournaments in
2008. The men’s team travels the Mid- '

ing to join a physical contact sport.

And speaking of physical sports, ’

Pitt’s ultimate teams land toward the
top of that list. The men’s and women’s
teams look for natural athletes who are -

dedicated and willing to put in time and ,

not only can he run the team from
the point, but with the game on
the line, pressure certainly won’t
get the best of him.

In a game on Dec. 20 at
Madison Square Garden against
Duke, Fields hit a 3—pointer with
just more than 4 seconds left in
overtime to give the Panthers a
dramatic victory over the Blue
Devils.

Young led the "Panthers on
their unbelievable run in the Big
East tournament last year. Be-
coming only the second team in
the toumament’s history to win
the entire thing while playing in
each of the four rounds, Young
was awarded Tournament MVP.

He also earned the Big East’s
Most Improved Player award
last year.

The two seniors are joined by
Blair, who was co-rookie of the
year in the Big East last season.

Blair, who comes from local
Schenley High School, gives the
Panthers an aggressive center
needed to win in the always-

physical Big East.

Women’s Basketball
Shavonte Zellous, Xenia
Stewart and Taneisha Harri-

A son

It seems that every year in

recent memory the Women’s

basketball team continues to set
records and advance to places
for the ﬁrst time.

Two years ago it was the

NCAA Tournament and the pro-
gram’s ﬁrst ever NCAA Tourna-
ment victory. Last year it was
the Sweet 16.

Although the Panthers are
losing a few great players who
helped build the program, coach
Agnus Berenato and the Pan-
thershave enough talent to con-
tinue to shake up -the current
records.

Last year Zellous led the
team in scoring with 18.2 points
per game, making her ﬁfth in the
Big East.

Stewart A provided the Pan-
thers with not only scoring but

rebounding and assists, too. The
senior scored 8.8 points a game
to go with‘ her 4.2 rebounds a
game and 2.5 assists per game.

Harrison saw a lot of play-
ing time as a freshman last year
and scored more than six points
a game. This year both her play-
ing time and production should
increase.

Wrestling

Zach Sheaffer and Jimmy
Conroy '

Sheaffer returns for his senior
season as the Eastern Wrestling
League’s heavyweight cham-
pion. V

It was Sheaffer’s second
EWL title in his career '— he
captured the title in his freshman
season in 2005.

Conroy also won the EWL
title in his weight class, the 133-
pound division. It was the ju-
nior’s ﬁrst EWL crown.

Volleyball

Meagan Dooley, ‘Michelle

Rossi and Kelly Campbell
Although the Panthers missed
out on the Big East tournament
last season, they retained most of
their players and appear primed
for a run toward the postseason.
Rossi led the conference in

digs last season, and Dooley ﬁn-
ished in the top 10 in blocks.
While both - Dooley and .

Campbell had good seasons last
year, they will have the tough
task of ﬁlling in for graduated
senior Diana Andreyko.

Wide receivers

Talk about depth.

Pitt returns All-Big East_ performer
Derek Kinder from injury and all of last
year’s top receivers as well. ‘

Cedric McGee, who received the Ed
Conway Award in the spring as one of the
team’s most improved players, is physi-
cal enough’ to take a pounding. Maurice
Williams and TJ. Porter also had great
springs, and both will be big—time targets
when the season rolls around.

Oderick Turner also returns.‘ Turner ,

was Pitt’s leading receiver last year with
Kinder out, and he showed an increased
ability to catch the ball in trafﬁc this
spring. A

Setting up next to the line will be tight

make plays with the ball or down in the
trenches. _ G

Offensive Line

The offensive line’s inexperience and
lack of depth has been one of Wannstedt’s
biggest worries throughout the year.

Junior-college transfer Robb Houser
looks to have nailed down the starting
center position, while tackle Joe Thom-

as handled his transition from guardrto

tackle better as the spring progressed.

Still, there’s no doubt the offensive
line has the most question marks lurk-
ing over it. Only time and health will tell
what’s to happen. But if the line holds
up, it could be the X-factor and lead the
Panthers to some wins.

season.

The Panthers’ Big East title
catapulted it to a No. 4 seed
in the NCAA Tournament, im-

T probable considering the Pan-

thers were just a seven seed in
their conference tournament.
Overnight, the Panthers be-
came a “trendy pick.” All of a
sudden Pitt was a sleeper and
talking heads like “the General”
Bob Knight got excited about
the prospect of the Panthers

working deep into the NCAA’

Tournament for the ﬁrst time
since 1974 — when there was

"; just a 32—team ﬁeld — and pos-

sibly winning more than two
games in the tournament for the
ﬁrst time in school history.

It didn't happen. Most ig-
nored the fact that Pitt emptied
its tank in New York.

Perhaps a successful season
this year means it must happen.

Despite its inability to be-
come a presence in the NCAA
Tournament, Pitt is a national
power. But a strong showing
during March Madness would
take Pitt to prestigious promi-
nence.

Pitt has compiled a 189-51
record, or a .788 winning per-
centage, the last seven seasons,
which ranks the Panthers among
the nation’s top-ﬁve winningest
programs, best in the Big East
during that span. But immersed
in the luminescence of the ex-
citing NCAA Tournament, the
Panthers have been respectable
at best and irrelevant at their
worst.

Looking ahead to next
season, relevance might be
achieved only by a deep run
into March and maybe even
April. _

 has grit. It always will. Playing

toughness will become Panther buzz
muflrds in October.
 " ut the Panthers will have more than

tations that are inevitably going to be

 returns considerable experience
faqd depth. Sam Young's decision to
 out of the NBA Draft in June gives
the Panthers a 1egitimate.go—to scorer.
Young, the Big East's most improved
lyer, averaged 18.1 points per game
 year and was selected to the All—Big
 ﬁrst team. This year, Young Will
ceitainlyi get consideration as the pre—>
season Big East Player of the Year.

~When healthy, Levance Fields is ar-
guably the league’s best point guard,
and Deluan Blair was the confer-
ence’s top freshman last season. Gilbert
Brown also showed steady progression
throughout the season and down the
stretch became a huge contributor for
the Panthers. ' »

Out goes Cassin Diggs and in comes
highly touted junior college transfer
Jermaine Dixon from Tallahassee Com-
munity College. Dixon is the brother of
NBA player and forlner Maryland great
Juan Dixon. Dixon gives the Panthers a
physical guard who can create his own

There is still an outside chance that
Mike Cook will be granted another year

 

 

  

i  eligibility, so Dixon will provide

considerable insurance at.the<off—guard
position in the event Cook’s career as a
Panther is over.

Pitt has the personnel to garner the
lofty expectations, but what's going to
make the club especially tough enter-
ing next season is its experience dealing
with adversity. Many teams in the coun-
try have as much, as or more talent than
the Panthers — Jamie Dixon has never
recruited a McDonald’s All—American
 but few have gone through the same
trials as the Panthers. ,

'._ Last year was a season of ebbs and
ﬂaws. Fields’ off~the—court issues prior
to the season left the Panthers’ status as
one of the conference’s elite in question.
 legal problems were settled, and _an

impressive win against Duke left no
doubt that the Panthers were primed to
scale the polls. *

However, the big win against Duke
at Madison Square Garden didn't come
without consequence — the Panthers
would lose Cook for the season to .a torn
ACL — but true to its ‘stigma, Pitt had
plenty of toughness left in the tank. The
team would need it when Fields broke
his foot against Dayton the next game,
once again surfacing critics. '

Many overlooked Pitt's grit and dis-
counted its ability to win without its
ﬂoor general, but Ronald Ramon took

the reigns and steadied I the ship in‘

Fields’ absence. In fact, Ramon’s 2.6
assist-to—tumover ratio was 15th best in
the country. Pitt held on, and the return
of Fields primed the Panthers for their
remarkable run through the Big East
tournament.

All its talent and experience could
make Pitt a consensus top—1O team en-

tering next seasonf It could also make
anything less than a Final Four appear-

ance unacceptable to the Panthers faith— .

ful.

With great hype comes great pres-
sure. Pitt will be out of style come
Toumament—time next March. Big East
Championships are great, but it’s time
for Pitt to step into the next realm.

Looking forward to next season, the
Pitt basketball program may never look
back.

"z

46, with 8 minutes, 39 seconds
remaining in the game. Stan-
ford took control at that point
and went on to victory, 72-53,
Pitt’s season was undoubt-
edly a success, but now the fo-
cus turns toward next year with
hope for further advancements.

Pitt loses three players from

last year’s squad. Walker was"

not takenin the WNBA Draft
but landed with the Houston
Comets as a rookie free agent.
Winn, who missed. all of the
2006-07 campaign with an
injury, averaged 8.3 points a

game as Pitt’s primary 3-point ‘
-threat. Backup point guard Kar-

lyle Lim graduated as well, and
she plans to play professionally
in Korea. \ .

Although the Panthers lost
plenty of talent, they arguably
return stronger this coming sea-
son. . ‘
Zellous will anchor the scor-
ing from the shooting guard
position as a senior. Slasher
Xenia Stewart was a produc-
tive fourth option last season,
and this year she will move to a
more important role. Sophronia
Sallard didn’t play much until
late in the season but emerged
as a vital cog with an outstand-
ing NCAA Tournament.

Perhaps the biggest wildcard

and most important factor will
be the type of production Pitt
receives from J ania Sims.

' A speedy 5—foot-7 point
guard, Sims started most of
Pitt’s games last year until she
was ruled academically ineligi-

ble. She missed the remaining .

21 games of the season, allow-
ing Winn to ofﬁcially claim the
starting spot.

If Sims can return to form

5- she was third on the team in

scoring average — the Panthers
will cause a lot of problems to
opposing defenses. i
Chelsea Cole should slide
into the starting center spot left

‘vacant by Walker. Cole put up

respectable numbers as a fresh-
man with 4.5 points and 5.0 re-
bounds per game. She also led
the team in blocked shots. Cole
is more mobile and quicker
than Walker and could have a
big season if she becomes more
consistent offensively. _
The Panther bench could be
as deep as the Allegheny River.

 

128’

    

Taneisha Harrison\ improved
immensely as her freshman sea-
son went on and should be the
ﬁrst off the pine. Forward Shay-
la Scott will get major minutes

. after ﬁghting through injuries
-last year. Ashleigh Braxton can

hit the outside shot, while Syl-
vie Tafen battles for rebounds

' under the basket.

Selena Nwude could help
Cole and Tafen in the front-
court, but she has to get on the
ﬂoor ﬁrst. Nwude missed all of
last season following a knee
injury suffered in the 2006-07
campaign.

At 6-foot—5, Nwude’s height

and rebounding would only

strengthen the Panthers’ re-
serves.

Two incoming freshmen add
to the recipe as well.'Shawnice
“Pepper” Wilson and Kate Pop-
ovec both ﬁt into Pitt’s equation
at center and might be asked to
play substantial minutes in their
initial seasons. Wilson will be

’ Pitt’s tallest player on the roster

at 6—foot—6. _
The teaching and maneuver
ing falls on Berenato, who en—;
ters her sixth season with the:
Panthers. Berenato has orches-3
trated a massive, turnaround L '
from only six wins in her ﬁrst ’__
year at Pitt to three consecutive 
seasons with 22 wins "or more. 1:

Berenato’s career coaching 8

record stands at 372-330, 89-9

66 at Pitt. She’s also coached:-at 1

Gray gains Valuable experience as backup for Bulls

Pros, page 116
and four sacks.

Andy Lee (Punter, San Francisco

49ers) , ~

. Punters usually don’t gain much rec-
ognition, but Lee stood out in a huge way
last season.

Lee punted a whopping 105 times in
2007 and averaged 47.3 yards per punt.
He booted 42 of those kicks inside the
20-yardline, and his net average stood at
41 yards a punt. _

,,That performance earned Lee a bid to

his ﬁrst Pro Bowl in the NFC. San Fran-

V cisco picked Lee in the. sixth round of

V the 2004 NFL Draft, and he has held the
starting position. since his rookie year.

A, Aaron ‘Gray, (Center, Chicago
0' Bulls)

A prestigious career at Pitt helped
Gray become a second-round draft pick
inthe 2007 NBA Draft. '

y The primaiy backup at center behind
. Ben Wallace and-then J oakim Noah, Gray
gained experience from the many veter-

ans on the Bulls such as .Wallace, Luol ,

Deng, Ben Gordon and Drew Gooden.

' In his rookie season, Gray averaged
4.3 points and 2.8 rebounds in 61 con-
tests. He shot 50.5 percent from the
ﬁeld.

The Bulls disappointed this year, fail-

V 3. ing to make the playoffs even though they

-L were expected to be one of the top teams

' in the East. Gray looks to take an active
part in the team’s turnaround, combin-

f ing with the young talent of Noah, Tyrus

don.

I ,7 In’the ﬁnal game of the season against
5,0 the Toronto Raptors, Gray achieved his
only start and delivered a phenomenal
j; outing. He set career-highs with 19 points
_  and 22 rebounds in 35‘minutes.
 ?7Gray scored 1,109 points and pulled
*  down 790 rebounds during his tenure at
42 Pitt. He was named to the A1l—Big East
team as a junior and senior and also
 earned Third-Team/All-America honors
. in his ﬁnal season.

 
  

Mark Blount (Center, Miami Heat)
E, Aside from Gray, Blount is theionly

 NBA. A second-round selection in 1997,

Jim Negrych (Second Baseman,
Pittsburgh Pirates Minors)

Although not reaching the major
leagues just yet, Negrych is turning
heads for the Pirates’ Single—A afﬁliate,

the Lynchburg Hillcats. ,

The fourth-round selection for the Pi-
rates in the 2006 MLB Draft out of Pitt,
Negrych is off to a rocketstart this sea-
son. Through 29 games, Negrych is bat-
ting .414 with 22 RBIs in 111 at—bats.

At only 23 years old and in Single—A,
Negrych probably has a few years left

until snifﬁng the majors. But if he con-

tinues to smack the ball, he might be the
ﬁrst Pitt productto reach the majors since
Jason Conti last played in 2004.

Walker wasn't chosen in April's
WNBA Draft, but landed in the women's
professional league anyway.

The former Pitt center latched on to

the Houston Comets and hopes to make

Walker has produced so far in pre-
season contests. She's scored 18 points
