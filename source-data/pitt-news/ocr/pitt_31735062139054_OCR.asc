NEW—COURSE -STARTED ’

I The advertising course in the. Even-

’ ing School began on Wednesday, Feb-

ruary 5th, with a lecture by Mr. W. T.
Mossman, advertising manager of the
Jones and Laug-hli_n,Steel Company.
Mr. Mossman sketc-hed brieﬂy the his-
tory of advertising from its mytholog-
ical beginnings, showing that it is no
longer conducted in a -‘haphazard way,
but has been placed upon a scientiﬁc
basis. He gave much credit to mod-
‘em inventions——-the printing press, the
‘telegraph, tele-phone, and transporta-
tion facilities-—for the large develop-
ment of advertising. This lecture is
but oneof a number to be included in
this.course.

VALENTINE PARTY

The “co-eds” of the College are

'.very busy of late preparing for a val-

entine party to be given next Thurs-
day evening in the gymnasium. This
promises I0 be one of the ﬁnest social
events "ever held under the auspices of
the college department. Invitations
have been sent out to the men of the
College and a number of professors
and their wives.

_ COLLEGE GETS NEW MACHINE

The College has purchased a stere-
opticon, to be used in room 107 Thaw
hall, and a method of darkening the

room has been devised, so that illus-

DR. THORPE ADDRESSES '
' . A COLLEGE ASSEMBLY

“Only as your mind becomes a unit
with the great minds of the past, will
you find a place among the great of
all ages,” said Dr. Francis ‘Newton
Thorpe, professor of Political Science
in the School of Economics, in closing
his address to the ‘College assembly
Wednesday morning, on" “The Cul-
tural,Va1ue of the Classics.” ’ '

Dr. Thorpe drew an extended par-
allel between the practical aspect of
life typiﬁed by John D. Rockefeller,
and the culturally inclined View point
of Macaulay, whose nephew and biog-
raplher, George Macaulay Trevelyan,
was an intimate friend of Prof.
Thorpe and imparted to,hi_m much
personal information about the great
essayist. Mr. Rockefeller, according
-to Dr. Thorpe, will, in the future. be
regarded much more kindly than at
present, and will be looked upon as
the greatest philanthropist of the age.

Every candidate gave a well‘

This is the important question of
the hour among the students of the
University of Pittsburgh. This might
be called‘“a foolish question, for who
could miss Qhe greatest social event of
the sc-hool year. The committee is
planning to hold a “Prom” that will
linger in the memories of those who
attend for years to come.

Very elaborate preparations are
being made and everything is being
done that could possibly add to the
success of the affair. ,

A number of patronesses have al-
ready been secured among the promi-
nent society people of Pittsburgh. All
the members of the faculty are asked
to subscribe for patroness tickets and
it is expected that they will all sup-
port the junior class at this time.

Invitations are being sent out as
fast as names are handed to the com-
mittee by the alumni and students. It
is necessary that these names be
handed» in as soon as possible as the
committee desires to have all the in-

‘ vitations out" this week.

' PROMISES

As the time for the election of head
cheerleader and three assistants ap-
proaches, much enthusiasm is evident.
Richard Johnson, ’l4,‘ head cheer-
leader last year, has "handed in ‘his

nomination to the Board of Control,
and it has been accepted. '

“Dick” gave good service last year,
although his task was most difficult,
because it is hard to get students to
root for a losing team. Under the
new rules laid down by the Board" of
Control only one other man in the
University, who is a candidate for the
position, is Clyde Hazlett, a junior in
‘the Dental school. “Pop” displayed
much enthusiasm while assisting
Johnson last year.

All nominations for assistant cheer-
leaders mus-t be in by Tuesday, Feb-
-ruary 18, and any students expecting
should get their

THE APITT WEEKIIY

COUNCILMAN M’ARDLE ‘ ,
SPEAKS ON CITIZENSHIP
, .. . .

Mr. ‘P. J. McArdle, member of the
Pittsburgh Council, addressed the
members of the School of Economics
at their weekly assembly in Thalw hall
Wednesday morning. He spoke on
“Citizenship.” ’ ' I

Mr. McArdle de.clared~that,he be-
lieved many evils now existing in mu-
nicipal, state and national govern-
ment were due, in large part, to the

. lack of every day interest on the part

of many citizens in the affairs of their
governmen_t. Mr. McArdle said: _
“Too many people understand their

constitutional rights and clamor for.
-protection of these rights. but have

no sense of their duty to t-he govern-
ment. These people make no contri-
butionto the betterment of govern-
ment.” ’ _

Mr. McArdle urged the college man
to go forth into the world with a de-
termination to take more than a pass-
ing interest in the government of his
city, his state and his nation. On this
point the speaker said in part:

“My message to you this morning,

A young men, is brieﬂy this:

5‘ ‘Go out from your University im-
pressed with the idea that you have a
duty to perform in the government of

. your, city, state and country, that can-

practically no debts topay and

not be fulﬁlled by a one-dayinterest

. in governmental affairs, but a‘duty

that requires a constant. every day in-
terest. This is the only way to get
anywhere in bringing about more ef-
ficient government.’ ”

MANY CANDIDATES TRYING
FOR CAP AND GOWN

TheiCap aiid\Gown Club has started
the season with the brightest pros-
pects in its history.

With several trips already assured,
an
unusual large number of candidates, a
very successful season -15 evident.

A-bout sixty men have reported for‘

parts in both the cast and chorus. _ All
parts are being awarded on a strictly
competitive basis and every man_ is
working hard .for a place. Dancing
master, Dr. F. D. Tyler, who has"been
drilling the candidates for the chorus
during the past‘nionth, claims that it
is the most promising‘ material that
has ever reported to him. Candidates
for the cast have also been working
hard. Two or more men have been
assigned" to each part and with the
able coaching of experienced men
should be able to produce an excellent
show. E

Anunoﬂicial report states that two

trips are sine and several others are
still’ being arranged. Two perform-

ances will be given at home.

The Cap and Gown‘ Club ‘enjoys the
distinction of b-eingthe ﬁrst student
activity to be entirely self-suzpporting.

The executive committeetook action‘

last fall to eliminate advertising from
their programs. This action means a
loss to the clu.b, but it will also be a
gain :to ‘the other student activities. ~

There is still an opportunity for
candidates to se-cure places, and all
students having any ability are asked

fto report_ at the rehearsal every Tues-

day. evening at 7:30 o’clock. _

ENGINEERING CHAPEL"

 

Prof.-Nesbit delivered the second of
a number of lectureson “The Diesel
Oil Engine,” last Wednesday morn-
ing, to a combined audience of engi-
neersand miners. The details of the
engine were discussed very t-horough-

' . ly, slides being used to illustrate the

various sections of the machine. The
‘speaker then pointed out the many
advantages of this .kind of engine, of
which the fact that the oil used is just
as it comes from. nature, is of. greatest

ONE  GONE.

The first week of the campaigii ‘to
raise $1,000 for the Owl has gone and
there still remains a- great amount
of the. needed sum to be collected.
About $250 ‘has been collected to
date, lellvillg $750 to be raised in ap-
proximately ten days. This means
that there. must be $75‘ contributed
each day from now on until the time
limit is up, if t'here is t_0 be an Owl
this year. .

Students who have not yet paid»

their money for this plll)llCatlOll to
one of the. managers of the Owl
should make -the payments at once
and not put the matter off until it is
too late to be of any service to the
Owl. This is especially applicable to
the members of the junior class of all
the departments of the University,
as.-they must of necessity be the i)ark-
bone of the Owl. , .If the jlllll)l‘S fail
to make payments on their own‘ book,
they can not expect ‘the other classes
to rally to its support as readily.

, Not let us all get together and
make the next week a good one it. r
the Owl fund. By the next issue of
THE PITT WEEKLY the entire
fund ought to. be in the hand of the
managers and the success of the Owl
made certain.

ANOTHER STEP FORWARD

The competitive system has been
adopted by another organization of
the University. Recently the Ath-
letic Association, through Director
Miller_ and Graduate Manager .l'):.vis,
announced they had, adopted the com‘-
petitive. system as the best means to
make selections for student managdrs
of the various lines of sport in me
~University. ‘Men who desire to be-
"come student inanagi-ers will report to
either Director Miller or Manager

Davis, they will be given work io do_

along the particular line 3f sport that
they desire to be connected with, and,
if they show ‘that -they have the
ability, they .will be given a position

' as manager or assistant inanaigcr of

one of, the organizations. Every man
in the University, no matter what de-
partment ‘he belongs t*i,‘lias a chance
to become a student manager, if he
shows that he merits The position .
THE PITT WEEKLY has always
contended that the coiiipetitive sys-
tem ‘is the only system that will pu-t
men at the head of every student ac-

position. The man_ that has shmi-n
himself to be the ‘best man in fair
competition with other students is.un—-
doubtedly, the man that ought to‘bq
put at the head of the activity with
which he is connected. We hope that
the day willsoon come wher every
student uses the competitive system
in the selection of oﬂicers.

» Dear Mr. Editor-,—I think that the
Director of Athletics and the Graduate
Manager are to =be commended. on the
introduction of a" competitive plan for
the appointment of student manager.
It means, I take it, tihat_Pitt_is to
have a system of undergraduate man-
agers and that these managers are to
be chosen on the basis of merit.

It is up to the students to show

their appreciation of this move by cre- '
ating some real competition for the.

positions that are now. open,
Here's success to the plan!
Yours for Pitt,

,Coach George M. Flint’s speedy
crewof ﬂoor artists are making the

- collegiate basketb.all_world sit up and

take notice as they have lost but
one game this year and that one by
a, very close margin, and have’ added

,t-he"sc.alps ofiisieveral bigiteamis to '-

their swelling list of victories. The

the team is out to win all the games
remaining on the card. - A . * C G

A The work of all is of the best,’ but
that of Johnny Baker, Pitt’s fast for-

~ ward, shines above that of the rest.

He leads in scoring by a.big margin
and deserves this position as he is
not a “basket hanger,” nor do the
rest of the team “feed” the ball to
‘him on all occasions. He often drib-
=bles ‘the ball the length of the ﬂoor
and"tossesi a*ﬁeld goal and- unlike
most stars he will pass to a team-

_ mate who is in a better position to

than himself. Capt.‘ Walt.
is doing great work at

shoot

ponent even while he scores a few
ﬁeld goal-s himself. Reese looks like
.a ﬁxture at center and Ochsenhirt has

‘ demonstrated that he is as good at

guard as he was last year at center.
Fris-hman was recently shifted to for-
ward from guard to make room for
Ochsenhirt and has played a fast,
consistent game at this position.

 Union Defeated.

The Pitt ﬁve easily defeated the
fast team from Mt. Union College last
Friday evening at the Trees Gym bv
a score of 43-21. The Buckeye team
started a fast pace but before the
ﬁrst half was over Pitt had braced
and were safely in the lead. After

V this it was merely a question of how

large the score would be, as the Gold
and Blue team seemed to" outclass
their opponents at every angle of the

' game. .Ochsen‘hirt starred on defense,

while Baker carried off honors on rl-e
offense, scoring’ ten ﬁeld, goals for
Pitt. Capt. Blythelooked to be the

best of the vﬁitors. The lineup:

SWIMMAS LOOK Goon

 

' The University swimming team‘ is ‘

practicing daily and according to“
Coach John T.iT.aylor, the men, al-
though green and inexperienced, show
promise and he expects the team to
surprise some of the critics. Nearly

thirty men have reported to Mr. Tay- ‘

lor for workouts and several of un-
usual excellence have been uncovered.
In Linn, Taylor has a plunger who in
his ﬁrst time out plunged nearly six-
ty feet nd should add several more
with a ittle practice. Hallock and
Bovine, two of the sprint candidates,
are to be entered in the swimming
mat to be held at the Pittsburgh Nat-
atorium next Tuesday. Other promis-
ing candidates include: Tanney
Winters, O.psion, Baker, Levy, Sweeﬁ
and Schmertz.

AGROVE ANNOUNCES GAMES

Baseball Manager.R. E. Grove re-
cently announce-d that he has ne.arly
completed his schedule and that by
the next issue of the PITT WEEKLY
he would have it in shape for publica-
tion. ‘

Among the games signed up to date
are two with West Virginia Universi-
ty,'one with Bethany and one with
Penn State. Grove claims ~ that the
1913 schedule will be the best ever
arranged for ,a Pitt nine and if the
three above games are only given as
a “starter” his assertion will certainly
prove correct.

‘E H FENCERS DO WELL

 

Roney and Bernard, two members
of the Pitt Fencing team, gave a good
exhibition of fencing between the
of last Friday’s ~basl_<etb.a1l
‘game at, Trees Gym. The bout was
won by Bernard, "3 to 2.

If other bouts of this kind are given
it would be well for the ofﬁcial in
charge to explain, to the audience
wh.at constitutes a«“touch” and to give
the score when the fencers change
sides and also at the end of the ex-
hibition. Few of t'ho'se present knew‘
who the winner was at the end of the
bout and very few knew what ‘a

“touch” was.

 _ FRESHMEN DEFEAT

High School as a preliminary to the
Pitt-M-t. Union game and the game
was greatly enjoyed by the large
croyvd. Coach Provin’s ﬁve showed
greatly improved form and deserve
much credit for their uphill ﬁght.

With but afew minutes’ remaining,
the opposing team was several points
to the good, but the freshmen rallied
and before the contest was over had
turned‘ the tables on the High boys
and ﬁnished ahead.‘

Capt. McCollough, Chartner and

J. Clarke did best ,work for

..._ __ ._—a

Director Chas. S. Miller is working.
hard with his track mater.ial in prep-
aration for the big indoor meet to be

held by the Y. M. C. A. at Exposition;

hall on February 22. The events of
this meet include dashes, distance-
runs, relay races and‘speci-al events
"for collegiate, scholastic, Y._M. C. A.
and industrial teams.

The most interesting event to Pitt
men will be a mile relay race between
teams from Ptitt, W. & J. and Penn
State. The Gold and Blue relay team
looks particularly strong in’ this event’
as three of last year.’s quarter-milers
are eligible to compete. Capt. Rosen-
fthal, Marshall’ and Hazlett were on
«the teamt-hat broke the relay record‘
at Pitt’s intercollegiate meet’ last
spring, and the fourth man will be
chosen from a wealth of material."
Among the most promising/of the
latter are McKinney, Shoff, Winters,
Thomas and McDona'lﬂ. '

About twenty runners will“represent
the Gold and Blue in other open
events and Pitt should have a substan-
tial total when the. ﬁnals come-in.

O

The track schedule is still far’ from '

corn-plete, but present conditions point
to a good list of track events. A team-
will be sent to the Penn relay games
in Philadelphia on April 26_th,and the
four or ﬁve men will be picked from
the winners of the quarter mile event
in the inter-department meet to be
held _on April 19th. ~ ’

The Penn authorities have classiﬁed‘
the colleges .in.to ﬁve groups and have
placed Pittsburgh in the second group.
Other important contenders in this
class are Carlisle, Penn State, Lafay-
ette, New York University, Haver-
ford, Amherst, ’ Toronto University
and Swarthmore. v

5 THE PITT WEEKLY -

in Praising Tuxedo Tobacco

HE history of Tuxedo tobacco is unique in
many respects. The now famous “Tuxedo
- ' process”——by which all the bite and sting is
removed from the best old Bur1ey_tobacCo——was
discovered by Dr.‘ R. A. Patterson," a physician of
Richmond, Virginia, the founder of the R. A. Pat-

terson TobaccoACompany. *
Many of Dr. Patterson’s friends, because their

mouths and throats were so sensitive, were com— _

pelled- to deny themselves the comfort and satisfac-
tion-tof pipe smoking. Like all other men, the
Doctor realized that complete smoke, delight was

possible only with a pipe. So he put his scientiﬁc

mind to wor_k on the problem.

,He'originat‘ed the ndw famous “Tuxedo pro-

.cess”‘ of treating the mildest, sweetest, most
a thoroughly aged Burley tobacco—and the result was

demand for Tuxedo. Now increased facilities make it possible for
every man to smoke this best of tobaccos.
