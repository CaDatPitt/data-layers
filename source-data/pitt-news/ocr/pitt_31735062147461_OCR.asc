No Permanent Peace

Q ‘I

C. Douglass Booth
' ANADIAN ~P-UBLICIST, who told
Inquiry Forum members Wednes-
day that present European policies
' will eventually lead to war.’ ‘

Inquiry ' Speaker
  Analyzes Tariffs

Booth Blames Unscientiﬁc Trade
Barriers For Economic Slump

High, unscientiﬁc tariff systems, re-
sorted to as measures of desperation,
rather than economic measures, have
played an important part in the pres-
ent economic depressions of the na-
tions of the World, stated Dr. C. Doug-
la.ss Booth, traveler and publicist,
speaking before Inquiry Forum, Wed-
iiesday. His subject was, “Removal
of Trade Barriers—a Condition of Re-
covery.”

“Also,” D1‘. Booth stated, “many of
our present troubles in Europe can
be traced" directly to economic ‘stu-
pidity on the part of certain naiiiioiis
after the l/Vorld VVar.

“Certain nations deﬁnitely exhibited
a lack of foresight, when they divided
the‘ Danubiaii empire into Austria,
with a population of six million peo-
ple, and 94 per cent of its territory
mountainous; Czechoslovakia; Jugo-
slavia; Hungary; and Roumaiiia.

“As soon as these countries were
establisliec,” Dr. Booth continued.”
“they immediately set about estab-
lisliiiig highly unscientiﬁc tariff walls.
Personally, I don’t think that it
ispossible to establish scientiﬁc bar-
riers with the existing internal an-
archy in certain countries in Europe."

Archaic Notions Hinder League

“Much in the way of stronger iii-
ternational cooperation,” Dr. Booth
continued, “is the constant struggle
going on between those maintaining
international power should be su-
preme aiid such men as Hitler and
Mussolini, who maintain that nation-
al power should predominate. The
latter group is ﬁghting to enforce its
ideals on the other nations. while the
former is ﬁghting to gain even great-
er international supremacy.

“The archaic notions of national su-
premacy a.re certainly no aid to the
League, and as long as this condi-
tion exists, no matter liow great the
sacriﬁces on the part of individual
nations, no one among them can per-
mmiently stay out of another war,” he
said.

“Some nations have already taken
advantage of the League, and the
disappointed nations tend to draw
themselves into an isolationist frame
of mind,” he added.

“Although En,glr4nd does not "roc-
cupy its great position of the past.
it may be that it is taking on a. new
historical role in which it is more iii-
terested in dominating the world
culturally, rather than imperialistical-
ly,” he said.

“Italy might look forward with
eager anticipation to taking over
Ethiopia, but England in her imperi-
alistic days looked Ethiopia over
thoroughly, and found its resources
not all they were played up to be,”
Dr. Booth added humorously.

In concluding. Dr. Booth said that
America would not likely turn to
fascism, because of the sectional dif-
ferences so characteristic of America.
“Altliough there may be spurts of
fascism at certain times, the move-
ment will not become uniﬁed to the
extent of becoming a nation—wide
movement.”

Pastor Chooses Sermon
Text From Current Song

“The Gentleman Obviously Doesn’t
Believe” will be the text for the ser-
mon of Dr. Bernard C. Clausen, pas-
tor of the First Baptist Church, Sun-
day evening at 8 o’clock.

The sermon will be in accordance
with Dr. Clausen’s practice of taking
his text once each year from what he
believes to be the current jazz “mas-
terpiece.”

A forum for the open discussion of
his sermon will follow the sermon.
and a.n hour of entertainment in the
banquet hall of the church will close
the service.

E. R. Bowen To Talk
At Community Forum

 

The Pittsburgh Community Forum

will hear "E; R. Bowen, genera'l"'sec="'

retary of the Cooperative League, na-

tem, Mr. Bowen has since become an
integral part of the cooperative move-
ment and feels that it is the only way
out of our economic impasse.

‘Student In A Whirl’
May Now Prove True

Boys and girls at the University
can now start going around to-
gether in the Cathedral. It’s an
old gag, it’s true, but it again ap-
plies, as the Fiftli Avenue entrance
is being groomed with a great big
revolving door. Give it a whirl.

Maybe some one in the Buildings
and Grounds department "discov-
ered that it’s plenty hard to force
open one of the regular type d_oor;z
a.t that entrance while the wind
sweeps up from the distance. Re-
sult: that door. You’ve probably‘
noticed it already. ‘ '

No other entrances will be so
equipped, at least for the present.

GroupOf Faculty
Considers Tenure

Body To Submit Recommendations
Guaranteeing Greater Security

Should college professors be ap-
pointed for life? Some fear this will
remove the stimulae to good teaching
and research. Will it?

Would it be better to appoint pro-
fessors for a deﬁnite period, reappoint-
ment depending oii the quality of
service rendered? Vvhat procedure
should be followed in dismissals?

These are among the questions for
which a committee of the faculty of
the University of Pittsburgh is eii-
deavoring touﬁnd, answers. .

For some time, the Board of Trus-
tees of the University has been con-
sidering liow under present ﬁnancial
conditions more security could be
guaranteed the faculty. Welcoming a
suggestioii of Governor George H.
Earle, the Board asked the Univer-
sity faculty to elect a committee to
submit deﬁnite recommendations.

Two main problems confront the
comniittee: (1) What would be an
ideal policy under ideal conditions?
(2) How close an approach to this
ideal is possible at the University of
Pittsburgh? The committee has an-
nounced that it welcomes advice and
suggestions from all members of the
faculty.

The members of the committee are
as follows: Dr. E. T. Sage, professor
of Latin, cliairinan; John A. Dent,
head of the department of mechanical
and aeronautical engineering; Dr. H.
H. Collins, professor of biology; Dr.
A. M. Goldberger, professor of educa-
tion; and Dr. Asher Isaacs, associate
professor of economics.

Meeting At Fifth Hour
To Feature Dancer
Ruth.St. Denis

In observance of the 40th year since
the entrance of women into the Uni-
versity, University women will meet
today at 12:30 o’clock in the ballroom
of the Hotel Sclienley to celebrate
Woman’s Day.

This is the eleventh time that the
women will have celebrated their en-
try into the University. All Uiiiver-
sity women students, women graduate
students, women faculty‘ members’
secretaries in University offices, and
mothers have been invited.

This year the guest artist will be
Ruth St. Denis, famous dancer. Miss
St. Denis is to speak on “The Temple
Beautiful,” "after which she will do
“Studies in Stained Glass” composed
by Saul Cohen which includes “The

‘ Nativity, The Dedication, The Cruci-

ﬁxion, and The Aniiunciati'on.”'

Miss’ St. Denis is an American, born
in- New Jersey and educated in this
country. She-has traveled, ﬁlled en-
gagements throughout Europe and the
Orient and has been dancing ‘profes-
sionally since 1906.

She; is the head of her own school
of .dancing, founder of the Society of
Spiritual Arts, founder of the Society
for the Friends» of the Dance, and au-
thor of a book of verse, “Lotus Light.”

Of Woman’s Dali’, Miss Thyrsa VV.
Amos, dean of women, says “Every
year I take great satisfaction in the
celebration of Women’s Day, for I
think it is ﬁtting that women in a co-
educational school do remember that
their presence here today was won by
the courageous efforts of the women
who pleaded their cause years ago.

“Men Profit, Too.” ,

“The nature of the celebration is a
distinction in itself because it is al-
ways interesting whether it is a per-
forinance by undergraduates or by a
prominent woman as it is this year.

“Woman’s Day really should be cele-
brated by the men since men have
proﬁted as much by it as the women.
Max McConn, dean at Lehigh Univer-
sity, has said this about it, _‘Under co-
education the mere fact that a man
works with a girl, at intellectual
tasks changes his whole conception of
the other sex, raises it somewhat al-
ways, and frequently very far away
from the plane of.the frivolous and
physical, in the direction of the social,
the serious, the intellectual, the civil-
izec.’ ”

The University first became coedu-
cational in 1895. At that time Chan-
cellor Vvilliam J. Holland presented
the petition of the Misses Margaret
and Stella Stein for permission to
study in the College to the trustees.
Permission was given and women
were admitted to the University more
than 160 years after its founding.

Vvomen are wearing little tags to
remind them of the occasion today.

The chairman of the WSGA Tradi-
tions committee whose duty it has
been to plan the affair is Elinor Scott,
Ed37. Her committee inc-ludes Harriet
Lewis Ed37I; Ione Williams, C38; Irene
Kocerha, Ed36; Helen Walko, Ed37;
Martha Bedswortli, C37; Dorothy Lang-
guth, Ed37; Ruth Recht, Ed37; Renet-

er C36;, Jean Barnes, C38; Grace El-
lis, C38; Virginia Luckliardt, Ed36;

Greeks Criticize
‘Hell Week’ Ban

Decision Delegated To Fraternities
After Council Debate Tuesday

Intei-fraternity Council, after a heat-
ed debate. has referred the subject of
the abolition or modiﬁcation of Hell
Week to the individual fraternities.

This action was taken at the IF
Council meeting at the Theta Chi
house Tuesday, after Edward Durkiii,
C36, president of council, and N. Rob-
er: Seidle, assistant to the dean of
men and fraternit.y« adviser, had re-
ported upon the resolution passed last
week at the National IF Council meet-
ing in New York. Joseph Rodgers,
C36, William -Harvey, C36, and Morris
Rosenblooin, C36, were strong in their
defense of Hell Week. All fraterni-
ties denied promiscuous use of the
paddle, a poi.nt of great contention
with the National Council,

Preparations for the interfraternity
informal dance 011 December 16 have
been completed, according to l.Villiam
Schenck, BA37, chairman. It was de-
cided to rename the dance the Inter-
fraternity Yuletide Festival, and to
make it an annual ﬁnal school dance
before the Christmas holidays.

Upon the suggestion of Durkin, the
group, by a close vote, agreed to rec-
ommend that the fraternity committee
permit transfer students to be initiat-
ed if their credits and grades at their
previous schools are equivalent to the
University requisites for initiation.

Immediately before adjournment, a
communication from VVSGA concern-
ing the entertainment of coeds un-
chaperoned in fraternity houses was
read and discussed, but the council
felt that no action was necessary.

Improve Your Sock

THOSE AMONG us whose Pitt spirit is even slightly
indisposed at the present time would do well to read
over the article by Dr. John B. Sutherland and William
S. Maulsby in the current issue of the Saturday Eve-
ning Post. The piece is called “Yea Pitt, Sock It To
’Em” and it has all the vitamins anyone needs to become
respirited about the University.

The philosophy of the article points out that the Pan-
ther football team, and the Pitt students likewise, ﬁnd
keenest delight in perfecting their. methods so that
they need not seek for weak points to attack, but rather
to assail the strong parts of their opposition. This, is
course, leads to the conclusion that victory so gained
is much more sweet than other sorts of victory.

It’s a yarn which you can hardly read all the way
through without wanting to pack up bag and baggage
and head for that great University in Pittsburgh.
Whether those of us who are here fully appreciate that
spirit which is Pitt and that tone which is Pitt is some-
thing else again. Spare yourself a few minutes and take
another dose of loyalty.

To be sure. the authors could11’t have known, when
they wrote the article some time ago, that on a certain
Thanksgiving afternoon the cheerleaders, who are de-
scribed in fairly glowing terms, called for not more than
three cheers from the student sections during the entire
second half while the Pitt team was out there trying
doggedly to hit its real stride against its most bitter
rival. Dr. Sutherland and Mr. Maulsby couldn’t have
foretold that any more than the fact that none of the
cheerleaders was “blessed with curly hair” this year.

Do1i’t let these minor discrepancies stop you. You’ll
stick your chest out an inch farther and hold your chin
several degrees higher when you read the article and
ﬁnd that you belong to a “Sock it to ’em” institution.

Forty, And Still Thriving

ODAY VVOMEN in the University are 40 years old.

And this is one time when there is no danger of their
understating t.liat age. Each year the women students
join together in a Woman's Day program to celebrate
the entry to feminine students into the University, Today
marks the 40th anniversary and brings with that rounded
number special celebration.

It goes without saying that in their twoscore years
here the women have made tremendous advancements in
curricular and extra-ciirricular Work. Starting from
scratch, they have devised a series of customs programs
which, for beauty and impressiveness, can hardly be
matched the country over. They have built up their
activities and supervised their organizations with an
excellence which justifies hard work and eager ambi-
tion over many years.

Dea.n Amos has said that by having women working
along with him a man almost always ﬁnds his appreciation
of their abilities and capabilities tending to grow. Argu-
ments may last from now until doom’s day concerning
the relative merits of co-educational schools and those
with all-male or all fe-male enrollments, but it seems
only natural to believe that a mixing of boys and girls
in work and in play will help tremendously when they
meet as men and women "of the world.

VVe hope they’ll all enjoy Woma11’s Day today, and
take no notice of those who might ask “When does Man’s
Day come around?”

Clinic To Clinic

R. H. CLIFFORD CARLSON swaps his work at the

Falk Clinic tomorrow to run the sixth annual Uni-
versity basketball clinic. To the layman, it may seem
odd that thousands of coaches and players will stay all
day up at the Stadium pavilion to observe what makes
basketball teams tick. It might also seem odd that the
various coaches care not a whit about presenting their
ideas and systems to one and all, without regard toward
covering up their own personal “secrets of the trade.”

The mushroom growth of clinics of this type in all
branches of sport certainly proves that those near the
top in athletics are eager to help bring better results to
those farther down the ladder.

The Good Doctor, as he is popularly called, deserves
no small credit for the energy and effort he has put
into making this clinic perhaps the outstanding basket-
ball affair of its kind. And we have an idea that the
Good Doctor will feel amply repaid if someone of the
c1inic—goers comes along and whispers in his ear a siire-
ﬁre-method for bringing victory to the Panthers every
time in that tough 26-game schedule they face this sea-
son. '

New Floor Offense To Show

Continuity, ‘l+‘igni°e 8’ Styles

Changes In Cage Rules
Bring Request For
New Systems

Many requests have come for new
offensive ideas to compensate for
comparative loss of pivot man activ-
ity. These requests have come from
practically every state in the Union.
The theme generally includes contin-
uity and “ﬁgure 8” offense. This
style can be used in the grade and
junior high school for the foundation
of subsequent offensive systems.

The system will involve the con-
tinuity of three men, with the possi-
bility of one of the three men being
replaced at any time by either of the
two men not included in the continu-
ity. The bases of the system can be
covered in two rules. The passer al-
ways cuts toward the basket in from
of his receiver. If there is no return
pass, the passer replaces his receiver
when the receiver passes to a third
teammate. .

The continuities may be over em-
phasized at ﬁrst with the understaiid-
ing that they are the sparringS‘f01‘
openings. The scoring possibilities
come with breaks in the continuities,
via return-passes. A pass to .a.II1aU
under the basket presents the best
bet. Alman freed under the basket
with" the ball makes‘ ‘the system stand
out:"'**‘ ‘“

__,0__ff__eﬁsive system Described

Tlfréiiflmen carry the action, Willi
two men having comparative rest. Of
course there is an interchange of men
at work and at rest. The modus
operandi is in interchange of “ﬁgure
8’s,” on either side, or near end and
mid-lines, and the on diagonals.
There are six possible “8’s,” each
utilizing three men and allowing two
men to rest. The continuities are ﬁrst.
established as such.

The scoring opportunities come
with breaks in the continuity by the
receiver returning the pass to the
passer cutting for the basket. This
return pass can be used on the side
line “8” with the passer cutting to-
ward the basket for a two-man tri-
angle or pass with return pass.

Development Of Offense

The ﬂoor may be divided into four
quadrants by an imaginary line from
basket to basket, which bisects the
new mid-liiie cross court. Three men
and a ball may be placed in each
quadrant in an arrangement stimulat-
ing the ﬁrst series of diagrams. This
will allow for the practice of. contin-
uity iii the side “8’s.” The D'<1~SS€l‘
cuts for the basket. He next replaces
his receiver when the latter passes to
a third man and cut for the basket.
The positions assumed correspond to
the numbers and are only relative in
order to clarify the action. The
groups may interchange sides to ac-
custom them to the action of each
side.

 

Passer Replaces Receiver

The ﬂoor may be divided another
way to give four division by a coii-
tinuation of the foul lines toward both
side lines. This will give a. division
to practice inside and outside “8’s.”
Three men can learn a continuity in
each division and then trade divisions
to practically repeat what they have
practiced. To reiterate, the passer
cuts for the basket, and, if he does

not get a return pass, he replaces his‘

receiver when the latter passes to a
third man.

The diagonal “8’s” are least used
and they cut down the number of men
practicing simultaneously. The same
rule applies viz the passer cuts for
the basket and later replaces his re-
ceiver in case continuities are con-
tinued. Again, the places assumed
are only relative but at this stage the
passer always cuts for the basket.

After the continuities are estab-
lished, ﬁve men may be placed in
each half of the court for offensive
practice. Proceed slowly at ﬁrst and
allow the passer to pass to any team-
mate and cut for the basket. The
passer will be replaced, as he cuts,
by the teammate who gave him the
ball.

Expressed another way, the passer
replaces his receiver in any continuity.
The team continuity is now establish-
ed. The scoring possibilities must
come with breaks in the continuity
through return passes.

Flexion Pass 13
New One To Try ,
On Your Cagers!

Most one-hand basketball passes
have been along the lines of a base-
ball throw. The action here presents
extension at the elbow, i. e., a straight-
ening of the arm. There has developed
other passes with the same action as
the hook pass. This latter action is
the opposite of extension at the elbow
since there is a tendency to have the
arm bent at the end of the action.
While most of the force comes from
the shoulder and body muscles, the
pass.may be called a ﬂexion pass. To
differentiate it from the extension
pass, the ﬂexion pass can be develop-
ed from any level, while the extension

pass must be expressed from above
the hip.

In addition to wider territory ver-
tically, it has other advantages. On
extension or baseball passes the ball
must be projected only from in front
of the-body. With the ﬂexion pass a
basketball may be projected forward
from behind, with the body as pro-
tection. The ﬂexion pass can also be
projected in any direction equally as
well. Fundamentals are as follows:

Catch the ball with either hand and
extend the other hand for protection.
'I‘hro_w the ball by ﬂexion passes with
either hand, underhand, side arm, and
overhead. On passes, anchor the foot
of the same side as lhe passing hand
and ﬂoat the opposite foot toward or
away from the side of the ball, as
well as pointing the free hand and
looking in the same direction as the
ﬂoater foot.

Practice Counts

Sure reception will come with prac-
tice. Hard, accurate projection to
either side of the receiver, with the
ﬂoater hand at work. is the ﬁrst ac-
complishment desired. The use of
the peripheral vision, and the ﬂoater
foot, and pointing. in the development
of deception is of secondary import-
ance to speed and accuracy.

Practice may he started at variable
distances and speeds. Pass alternate-
ly to left and then right. The ﬂexion
pass can be made by either hand to
either side of the receiver. Both the
passer and the receiver should utilize
the ﬂoater hand. At ﬁrst the passer
looks, points, and steps directly to-
ward the receiver. The latter learns
to protect on either side with the
ﬂoater hand and steps toward the ball.

Increase the speed for reasonable
distances but aim for accuracy to
either side at all times. The receiv-
er should try to conceal the ball uii-
der the shoulder by pressing the ba.ll
against the upper arm and by stand-
ing sidewise toward the opponent.
The ball may be held in this fashion
on top of the shoulder with the ﬂoater
hand always in action.

Floater footwork, pointing, and per-
ipheral vision come after accuracy
and speed have been developed, with
either hand. Slide away the ﬂoater
foot, point away with the ﬂoater hand.
look away from the ball, and pass
with side arm or underhand ﬂexion
passes by air. The bounce pass will
come later. Cross the ﬂoater foot
and hand over toward the side of
the ball and look beyond the ball and
make an overhead ﬂexion pass at ap-
proximately right angles to the orig-
inal position of the body.

Later this pass may be practical at
a greater angle. Instead of directly
ahead of the original position of the
body, the pass may be in the oppo-
site direction from the side of the
ball. This last pass will necessitate
more help from the shoulder, spine.
and hips. About twelve passes will
cover the deception by slides and
crosses of feet and passes by both
hands.

The practice for the dribble and pass
will follow the same sequence as the
pass practice. Each hand can be util-
ized but for description and a.n easier
creation of the desired picture, the
right hand action will be described.
The ball is caught with the right hand,
the left hand is the ﬂoater or protec-
tor.

Game Of Basketball Provides Student
With Mental And Physical Training

 

The use of a basketball, without any
shots for a goal, may be the medium
for a game in any physical education
class either for boys or girls. The
continuity of interchanging “ﬁgure
8’s” will give both mental and physi-
cal activities and emphasize coopera-
tion rather than competition.

Mentally, the ‘individuals will make
many decisions, must act, and enjoy
many triumphs because of having
made decisions and actions. Physical-
ly, there will be rhythmic as well as
dynamic action of large and small
muscles. The individuals can learn
to think while in action. They will
learn to look peripherally and direct-
ly. They will learn to run and stop,
to catch and pass, and thereby estab-
lish the“basic skills for many games.

The starting lineup can show three
players lined up near the basket with
one at the foul line and one at either
side line where the foul line, if con-
tinued. would intersect the side line.
The other two players, could stand
nea.r the mid-line, equidistant. from
each other and the side lines. There
would be only two rules to the con-
tinuity in general.

First, the passer passes and cuts

toward the basket. Second, the passer
replaces his receiver after the latter
passes to/a third player. Individually
the receiver in this game never re-
turns the ball to his passer. Therein
is the basis for individual rhythm.
The receiver catches the ball on the
count of one, he makes a motion to
return the ball on the count of two,
and then on count three he passes to
any of the other three of his mates
and then runs toward the basket.

The game may be started by the
man at the foul line. He passes to
anyone and moves toward the basket.
He replaces his receiver when the lat-
ter passes to another player and runs
toward the basket on the count of
three.

After the various “ﬁgure 8’s” are
mastered and the relative positions
are assumed, the interchange of “ﬁg-
ure 8’s” is a rather easy process. This
interchange, with an observance of in-
dividual rhythm, the decision to
whom to pass, the use of peripheral
vision, and physical activity, will all
contribute to the welfare of the par-
ticipants. The players will liave es-
tablished a basis for late.r basketball
cooperation and competition.

Panthers Meet Prexies
In Grand Finale;
Freshmen Play

 

Remember a few weeks back when
the Pitt footballers walloped the
VV&J’s, 35-0? One of the better radio
sport reviewers in announcing the out-
come wagged, “You crown kings, and
you inaugurate presidents, but the
Panthers took matters into their own
hands today, reversed the tradition
and “crowned” the Presidents, 35-0.

Well, another of VVash-.l'eff’s ath-
letic squads, this time the basketball
team, comes to Pittsburgh and the
Stadium tomorrow night, and this
time Dr. Carlson’s varsity cagers will
attempt to do the crowning.

It's the opening game of the district
basketball season, and the closing
ceremony in Carlsoii’s sixth annual
cage clinic at the Stadium.

It has been a long time since the
Presidents have had what it takes to
teach the Panthers to say “uncle.”
Last season, it is remembered, the
Pitt cagers hung up their highest
score on W&J in a 57-30 battle. That
was the only meeting of the two
schools in basketball last year.

The game tomorrow night offers
the Pres_idents__anoth-er opportunity to
beat the Panthers. It’s'hould be an
evenly-matched pair of teams which
line up at the starting whistle. Both
outﬁts have been hit hard by gradua-
tion and loss of last year’s stars. Out
here in Oakland, Dr. Carlson has had
trouble ﬁnding a suitable starting
combination. As a result, probably
only one player, Captain Ted Roderick,
will be in the lineup tomorrow night

’ who started the opening game in the

1934-35 season.

Of the other four positions, three
will be ﬁlled with players having no
previous varsity experience. Teaming
with Roderick at the forward post
will be Bill Jesko, a letterman who
served last year in the role of substi-
tute. Joe Garcia, six foot, two-inch
center, will start his ﬁrst varsity game
for the Panthers. Two sophomores
will take care of the guard posts, Ed
Spotovitch and Bob Johnson. Both
of these boys were stars on Dockey
Kowallis’ crack freshman team last
year.

The varsity game tomorrow iiighl.
will" start at 8 o’clock with the Pitt
freshies taking on the W&J frosh ﬁve
at 7 o’clock in the preliminary battle.

Talks, Demonstrations,
Will Feature Sixth
Annual Affair

Before an expected crowd of 3,000
scholastic cagers and coaches, Dr.
Carlson, aided by the Pitt, Tech and
Duke basketball teams, will ring up
the curtain on his sixth annual cage
clinic in the Stadium tomorrow morn-
ing.

Starting at 9:30 o’clock in the
morning with the usual routine reg-
istration, the. Carlson cage circus
runs one continuous all-day perform-
ance, ﬁnally winding up with the Pitt-
Washington and Jefferson freshman
and varsity basketball games in the
evening.

There will be plenty doing the en-
tire time. A program of events has
been drawn up by Dr. Carlson, and
there will be events ranging from
talks on basketball subjects by promi-
nent cage authorities to demonstra-
tions by the Tech and. Duquesne var-
sities. Chick Davies, Duquesne varsity
coach, and Max Hannum, Tech coach,
will personally direct their boys in
the demonstrations.

The morning proceedings will in-
clude descriptions and demonstra-
tions of one-hand- passing, an intro-

‘dllCtlO,l1’l'.0_ a new game to be played

in physical education" classes ibyigiiade
students from the Friendship School,
and at 11 o’clock two high school
teams will be selected by lot to dem-
cnstrate new offensive systems.

Here, there is a brief lull in the
clinic program with the guests mov-
ing down to the University Cafeteria
for luncheon. At 2 o’clock the after-
noon session starts, the Tartans and
Dukes taking the spotlight to exhibit
various offensive and defensive tac-
tics. These two teams have been fea-
tures of the last two clinics with their
demonstra'tions. Along with the Tech-
Duquesiie affairs, there will be inter-
pretations of the new and old rules
by the college coaches and officials.

At the dinner served at the Univer-
sity Faculty Club, talks will feature
the program. Speeches will be given
by Mr. A. T. Grover, coach of Ohio
University in the Buckeye Confer-
ence, Mr. Ted Peyseur, of Northwest-
ern in the Big Ten, and Edward VViclit,
of the PIAA.

At that time the clinic will adjourn
until 7 o’clock when the Pitt freshies
battle the W&J frosh.
