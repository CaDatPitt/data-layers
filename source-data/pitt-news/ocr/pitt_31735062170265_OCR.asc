the Board of Trustees’ activ-
ities?” asked Sharon Novak, stu-
dent member of the Board of Trus-
tees, at the Student Government
Board (SGB) meeting Thursday
.. night. ~

Novak is a graduate student at
Pitt. She views her dual position
as a unique opportunity to repre-
sent the student body on the
Board. Complaining that her pre-
vious attempts to confer with SG
had been futile, she visited the

f,§GB’s weekly meeting to initiate

some form of communication to
help her express the views of stu-
dents on establishing long-range
policy of the University. She
urged the SGB to take a position
and to make it known to the Board
because ‘.‘they are very much in-
terested.” ‘
._ SGB President Tom Bailey and
Board member Dave Bluey, who

attended the last Board of Trus- ‘
A tees meeting in May, said, “The

Board of Trustees seemed like a
non-functioning body. Everything
is done in committee and there is»
nothing to be done at meetings ex-
cept rubber stamping.”

Novak'retorted that the Board,
meeting only three times a year,
relies_- on the experience of its
members to make judgments on
their respective committees and
the committee’s recommenda-
pons is considered substantial
backing for a decision.iRubber

The first.music therapy pro-

35 former music education ma- '

According to Richard Gray. the
director of the program. the stu-
dents will be taught to “effective-

help correct psychiatric and phy-
sical disabilities."

A relatively new field, music

was ‘Rubber Stamp’

by JOAN EASTBOURNE

"Why hasn’t Student Govern-
ment (SG) Shown any interest in

stamping is not the right term—
the Board is sharp and not close-
minded.”

Stressing the function of the
Board of Trustees as determining
long-term policy and planning for
the University she said. "the
Board wants feedback." which
she feels SG can give her to com-
municate to them.

She requested they compose and
submit a position paper so the stu-
dent voice can be heard. Board
members agreed this to be impor-
tant and an attempt will be made
to do so.

Bailey again brought to atten-
tion the increasing danger in
crossing the streets around cam-
pus unmarked by traffic signals.

Says Labor'Bui/t Pittsburgh

Shriver Woes Ethnic Groups

by SHARON SEXTON
Campus Editor

R. Sargeant Shriver. the Demo-
cratic vice-presidential candi-
date. made an appeal for support
to a group of 1,000 gathered at
the Ethnic Fair in Niagara Park
on Sunday night. ‘

On his way to the stage. Shriver
stopped briefly at several stalls

, where he munched on gnocchi. hot

dogs and sauerkraut and soul food
and intermittenly fielded ques-
tions from the press.

He shook hands, smiled fre-
quently and encouraged everyone
to register and “get out there and
vote.”

His progress to the microphone
was interrupted by a member of
the Lebanese dance troups who
demanded, “Why did McGovern
blame the Lebanese people forthe
incident in Munich?” .

Shriver replied, “He never said

that."

As‘ ‘Shriver mounted the stage
the members of the Italian dance
troupe stopped their dance to
greet him.

Shriver took off his coat, then
his tie and began to roll uphis
sleeves. ” .

Somone demanded to know what
else he planned to take off.

“My pants!” he exclaimed.

One woman, a member of the
dance group shouted gleefully.
“Okay. take it all off! "

She broke into a lively and fes-
tive version of the Tarantela and
Shriver joined in.

Reforms Stressed at

lege, Duquesne University, Point
Park College, and the University
of Pittsburgh, was termed by
Pittinger as “one of the best ways
to achieve inter-university coop-
eration.” - '

Pittinger made several refer-
ences to the report made by the
Carnegie Commission as he out-
lined three major types of reform
for our system of higher educa-
tion: shorteningthe’ quantity of
time spent in earning given de-
grees, broadening the use of new
teaching methods made possible
by modern technology and main-
taining a tighter system of eval-
uation of teachers by both their
colleagues and students.

He distinguished between these
kinds of reform, which are orient-
ed toward efficient utilization of
staff and facilities, and “retrench-
ment" which is general cutting
back and lowering of standards at
all levels of an institution.

There was excited applause
when the Secretary of Education
announced that Senate Bill 30 had
been passed, for the “measure
will givea rational direction for
growth” to higher education in
this state, where, “elementary
school teaching is a good deal bet-
ter than a lot of what is going on
at the higher levels.’-’

Giving schools this new “direc-
tion" will be difficult by the fac-
ulties of the different institu,tio_ns,.

For the next five minutes Shriv-
er stamped his feet’, clapped his
hands, and waved his arms in the
air to the frantic rhythm of a
tamborine.

The crowd reacted spontaneous-
ly by crowding around the stage.
clapping and cheering loudly.

After five minutes of fun he
stepped to the mike. breathless
and drenched with sweat and ad-
dressed the crowd.

THE BEST way to learn Spanish—hablar con el gente.

[Field Trip Successful

; . Last April, a group of Pitt students embarked on a two month field
trip to Colombia, South America. The crew included students from all
grades and departments with varying capabilities in Spanish. Spon-
A tsored by the Latin American Studies Center and financed through the
‘ ‘ "University and the National Science Foundation, the group—at almost
';;no personal cost—was able to visit the capital city of Bogota for two
eeks, stop at the coast for two days and study in a small town for six
weeks. ’

s. ' The field activity was preceded by a seminar, held winter term.
designed to familiarize the students with Colombia. The actual field
w.ork was carried out in Guarne, a small town about 15 miles from
;Colombia’s second largest city, Medellin.

! Each student'Iived with a family in the town. Living in a Latin
American cultural environment, the group had the chance to compare
their own observations about the culture with the general observations
‘about’ Latin American culture foundiin literature. They also had the
‘opportunity to design a project and field test for simple hypothesis.

1 w I Responses were optimistic and enthusiastic; no one could deny the
‘fact that this program provided an invaluable learning experience and
_.a much better insightinto Latin American culture and humanity.

} -The Latin American Center is now making plans for next year’s
activity which will follow the same format as last year’s program. In-
Jterested students should go to the Latin American Studies Center (216
, bocial Science Building) before, Oct. 6 and fill out an application for an
‘ inter‘-viebvv. ‘Students in any major are -welcome to apply and fluency in
‘Spanish is not required because living with a Latin family will teach
more Spanish than any University course can.

  Music Therapy

(Continued from Page 1)

Through music therapy, retard-
ed children have l_earned to speak
and to move with coordination.
Exercising to music is involved in
strengthening muscles and im-
proving coordination in many nor-
mal and handicapped people.

The program itself is composed
basically of music education
courses. In addition, each student
receives a solid background in so-
ciology and psychology along with
a series of practica.

The_latter are still in the pro-
cess of being set up, but their pur-
poses will be to expose the stu-
dents to many of the settings in
which music therapy may be use-
ful. Examples would include work
with distrubed youths, drug abuse
cases, the mentally retarded,’ the
blind and deaf, the physically dis-

, abled, and inter-city youth.

Gray cited as one example an
emphysema group where a mu-
sic therapist worked with a chap-

-lution and anti-consumer policies, This author be-

by, we hope but do not really expect, the city ad-
ministration to do something.

So we sit‘and sit and sit. . The pollution be-
comes worse, employers still discriminate and stores
persist in gyping their customers.

What is needed is a coalition of concerned citi-

zens, lawyers. _ scientists. students and ‘other, work--
ing together to bring about changes and put pressure on .

the polluting industries; identify and boycott the anti-

_ consumer dealers; sue the discriminating businesses.

In its first year. the Public Interest Research

Group of Western Pennsylvania (PIRG) is such an or-'

ganization. With city chapters at Pitt, C-M U. Du-
quesne and Chatham, they define their purpose as
 . . participating in research projects to bring about
necessary legislation or remedial action resulting in
tangible social change.” '

Oregon State PIRG (OSPIRG) is the oldest and
most effective of the 26 student PIRG’s in this coun-
try. Their accomplishments are many. For’example,
they investigated auto repair dealers in their county
and found “62 percent of the shops quoted prices for
apparently unneeded and unnecessary repairs and
replacements.” Other probes varied from examining
Oregon’s Department of Agriculture-meat inspection
to studying water qualities of local rivers.

The idea of‘ student public interest research
groups _was first suggested by Ralph Nader, the fa-

He, with his own Washington based firm as living
proof, toured college campuses telling students they
could combat the problems that beset them. To estab-
lish such an organization, he advocated a mandatory
invoice-return system. By this, he meant the college
should invoice students for an additional two dollars.
This money would be the funds for a student PIPtG.~
In September, those students that did not agree with
the billing could have their money returned. '

The administration of this University would not
permit such a billing. Thus, Pitt’s PIRG has had to
resort to a direct mailing to raise funds. This past
week, letters were sent to most of Pitt’s students ex-
plaining PIRG’s objectives, and requesting a donation
of $2.00. . '

Is $2.00 a semester too much to pay for cleaner

1 air, for an end to discrimination and for consumer

protection? Of course, the ills that plague Pittsburgh
cannot be cured by this one organization, but this is a
beginning. A union of students paving nrofessional
people as investigators will hopefully solve some of the
the city’s problems. No more relying on an innefec-
_tive city government; no more waiting. We have the
means to constructively change some of the inade-
quacies of Pittsburgh.

The muckraker’s of Pitt’s PIRG need _vour two

dollars. Will you contribute this meager sum. in this
way helping to produce effective change? Or will

by JOHN METCALFE

One of my friends has an exaggerated opinion
of the moral force a college newspaper writer
owns. She has asked me several times to make a
declaration of support for the candidate we both

fa-vor. By different margins, I will, but not just-

now. First I'd like to mutter’ about voter regis-
tration.

It is silly to argue politically with those who,
through choice or laziness, are ineligible to’ play
any part in selecting the politicians who will
serve us themselves, and their friends, for the next
four years. '

These people are not registered to vote. Some
of them have invented or borrowed philosophies
which prove there’s no point to participating in
an already corrupt System. — - '

This ploy does save them the trouble of going
to the registrars and filling out a simple form.
It also spares them the trouble of figuring out a
ballot "or a voting machine; in fact, they are
exempt from choosing among the alternatives
presented to them, and can criticize all of them
equally.

I do not suggest that all alternatives are pre-
sent on the average ballot. But anyone who can-

not tell Nixon amd-McGovern apart is probably

asleep or dead.

If we assume that it is possible to choose
among scoundrels, then it becomes an‘ obvious
personal obligation to register, if not to elect the
best possible men, then at least to exclude the
worst. 1

This attitude may seem pessimistic; it just
,might be. But for several years of my middle and
late adolescence I was out of the country, and
not exposed to the language of our native poli-
ticians. As a result, when I hear one now, I lis-
ten. I no longer have that defense mechanism that
tunes out soap commercials and political state-
ments. When I listen, I frequently hear what the
politicians are saying, and I am amazed that the
multitude does not rise up and tear them to bits
for taking such liberties with the truth.

Some“ offend more than others, though an ideal
world would be rid of the whole tribe, and we must
content ourselves with the least offensive of those
presented to us.‘ The alternative is to accept self-
proclaimed leaders, and their record is even
worse.

It is necessary to register. I personally am
registered as an Independent. This saves me from
accepting wholesale the opinions of either large
party; it also prevents me from helping either
group select candidates. This is not entirely a
handicap. In the spring I did not especially want
any of the members of either party to represent
me—this approach has lately become respectable.
and I still favor it. But there are some I desper-
ately want to see excluded from the business of

,government, and, being registeredﬁl can vote
against them.

Sometimes this feeling is evenhanded. For
instance, if McGovern should be elected. we
would lose one of the finest senators we have

' ever .had,, withno guarantee of getting a great
« ;presiden,t,e.in‘_, return.“ On the other hand,

   

A can keep

.it."W0l_l1d. honest. .:  

  

you do nothing, thus prolonging the discomfort of pol-
lution and discrimination? '

Elect a Friend  

be grossly unfair to deprive Pepsi Cola of one
of their best lawyers by tying Mr. Nixon" down
to four more years at a fixed income.

Either candidate for the presidency might
very well prove a disaster for the country. As
no realistic third possibility presents itself,. we
must’ try to choose the smaller of the two dis-
asters.

For this reason, I favor McGovern.

Nixon has had four years to show what he can
do. The fact he faced reelection may have re-
strained him somewhat, though that is hard to
imagine in the face of what he has accomplished. ,
Admittedly, he inherited a war, One analysis sug-
gests he inherited it from himself, as he was
vice-president when it began. At any rate,‘ he

. seems to have shrunk it. However, he uses figures

which ignore the one hundred and ten thousand
troops and airmen outside the Vietnamese bor-
ders who are engaged in hostilities. He is. using
explosives on a scale not even approached by the _
World Wars of this century. This may be partly
because he has access to unprecedented powers-
no doubt Attila or‘ Stalin would have used them
too—but the comparison is hardly flatter)ing.

Mr.Nixon may be personally immune to high
prices, at his income level, but he has not hesi-
tated to raise food prices for the rest of use.

He has cleverly . bypassed the traditional
checks on executive power. The catalogue would
go on.

x I prefer to take a chance on the devil I don’t
know. The one I do know has my country as deep
in Hell as it can get, and I’m ready for a change
of devils. '

So much for that. Those who do register, and
do show up to vote will find they are faced with
more than a choice between Nixon and McGovern. .
A great multitude of smaller offices must be
filled. In many cases, neither candidate will be
known to the voter. Sometimes the offices they '
seek will seem to have been made up on the spur
of the moment. Here I take a different view of
political processes.

To me, most of these minor politicians are
vermin. They affect our lives on the local level,
cast votes in our names, make decisions and-

spend money supplied by the public, but rarely’-1“?

do us the courtesy of introducing themselves.
They come to our attention first as names on the
ballot. ‘ '

-Here is a chance for the long-suffering voter
to feel a sense of power. Do not vote for strangers.
Vote for a friend, or for yourself, or for nobody
at all. Eliminating these free rides might create
a more conscientious breed of politician at the
local level; as their elders die off they could
replace traditional politics with a human ap-
proach to government.

No matter, I shall vote for McGovern, and
those other candidates in my district I recognize.
I won’t bother warning agairrst straight party
voting.

We might not be‘ able to "eliminate the in—_
competent and unfit. from public o_ffice,»b_ut we

    Letter to the Editor

Editor,

Last Friday’s issue of the Pitt
News contained two references to
comments I made. Since one‘ of
my remarks was misquoted and
the other taken out of context.
I would like to set the record
straight.

In a front page story on Stud-
ent Government’s free concert
I was quoted as saying that Stud-
ent Government acted improper-
ly by not submitting a “budget
modification form” to the Alloca-
tions Committee. I

I do not nor ‘have I ever felt
that Student Government acted
improperly in any way by not sub-
mitting a budget modification
form.

The whole. idea that policy de-

cisions should be ‘subject to the L

whims of the Allocations Com-

‘ mittee seems absurd. The Alloca-

C

  

tions Committee does .not have
the knowledge or concern to tell
organizations what is best for
them. Moreover, the Allocations
Committee meets so irregularly
that emergency decisions cannot
be made. ‘

If these accusations appear "a
bit strong, consider the wisdom
shown by the Allocations Com-
mittee is some of its.past deci-

sions. PIRG’s budget was cut 63 ’

cents because members of the
Allocations Committee did not
think that PIRG needed to spend
18 cents’ for a letter opener and

45 cents for a staple remover. ’

The budget for_the Skyscraper En-
gineer has not been reported out
of committee even after 1 regular
session and two emergency ses-
sions of the committee; this des-

pite the fact that the Skyscrapr
has not been able to spend any
money since July 1. This delay by

' the Allocations Committee has al-

ready delayed Skyscraper’s con-
tracting with a printer for its first
issue. Further delay could cause
Slyscraper to lose several hun-
dred dollars in advertising in-
come.

The point of my remarks con-
cerning a budget modification
form was not to criticize either
the Student Government Board
or Bob Emanuele, Chairman of
the Progra Board. The place
where blam lies is with the ab-
surd rules of the Allocations Com-
mittee which are neither realistic
nor enforceable.

The second'point of correction
concerns a statemet in the edi-
torial which implied that student
seeking legal advice through the
Legal Awareness
would be charged $5 per half
hour. This is factually incorrect.
Any student needing legal advice
may obtain free professional
counsel with an attorney through
the Legal Awareness Committee.
Without the services of the Leg-
al Awareness Committee, consul-
tation fees couldrange from $5 to
$25 per half hour.

I feel that it is important that
students know they can get free
legal counsel through the Legal

Awareness Committee so that they

can solve any legal hassles before
it becomes necessary to pay to
go to court.

Thank you for the opportunity
to set the record straight.

Sincerely,
Jeff Pasek

i Undergrads Break Into Teaching -

Student: “I, think that as machines do more of
our work, we’ll lose parts of our body because we

and yet, my children will have all of their fingers.”

More people begin to voice opinions. All have

“The whole thing started ‘when some faculty

some guidelines so that students wouldn’t be

the money.” Jerome Schneewind, Dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences, continued, “I’m quite
pleased.” '

The CASC decided that they would approve a
course proposal, requesting the use of undergrad-
uate aides, if it adhered to the following guide-
lines:

(1) If the proposal states “the functions to be
performed by the students and why the depart-
ment feels these functions will improve the ed-
ucational experience . . .”

used for the selection and evaluation of teaching

“Brandy” is great, butthis album
isn't. They've tried to incorporte
too mny different styles into
their music and sound like they

§"\could’t decide whether tobe the

Rascals or Poco. Another “nice”
album; good to study to because’
it doesn’t require concentration.

Lighthouse—LIVE (Evolution-)—
This 10-man Canadian group is
sort of an across-the-border Blood.
Sweat and Tears. but with a little
extra——strings and vibes. For a live
album, the sound quality is quite
good; production work is excel-
lent. Best tracks are “One Fine
Morning” and 13-minute ver-

V sion of "Eight Miles High.”

.;1ac Davis—BABY DON’T GET
HOOKED ON ME (Columbia)-

5_ ./\“As a long-time-lover of Mac’s

songs, I was most disappointed

_ that he let Rick Hall (who produc-

es the Osmond Brothers) have free
rein and overnroduce all of Mac’s
beautifully simplistic songs.
They’re mostly written for his wife
Sarah; she’s a very lucky wom-
. an—the songs come from the
heart. The title track, “Lonesom-

est. Lonesome,” and “Poor Boy‘

Boogie” are tops.
Leon Russell—CARNEY (Shel-

ter)——The cover says it—Leon in
white-face——"all the world’s a
stage, and we are only players.”
And listening to this. one gets the
distinct impression that Leon is
tired of being a player. Listen to
"Tightrope" or "This Masquer-
ade”—his soul is laid bare. An in-
trospective album based on the
"carnival” theme. but lots of good
rock ‘n’ roll.

The Partridge Family—-GREAT-
EST HITS (Bell)—Don’t laugh, this
is really a good album. It’s bubble-
gum, but somehow has a way of
growing on you. And the songs
are innocuous enough to be good
to study to—nice background
stuff. Note some of the Fifties
influence—like “Echo Valley 2-
6809” equal “Beechwood 4'-5789.”

Simon & Garfunkel——GREAT-
EST HITS (Columbia—It doesn’t
include “Fakin’ It” or “Dangling
Conversation" and a couple
others I can’t remember. but there
are fourteen biggies here—all-
the ones that made S&G household
words through the late 60’s..Even
though you’ve probably got "Mrs.
Robinson” and “America" and
"The Boxer” and "Emily," it’s nice
to have them all in one place.

Jefferson Airplane — LONG
JOHN SILVER (Grunt) Somehow,
they’ve never regained what they
lost when Marty Balin left-
though the two lovebirds, Paul
and Grace, do pretty well. The

Three Dog Night— SEVEN SEP-
ARATE FOOLS (Dunhi1l)——This
bunch could do an album of com-
mercials and they‘d still sell a mil-
lion._ But this collection is another _
in their string of hits—a truly good
album. Their current single “Black
and White." Randy Newman's
"My Old Kentucky Home" (which
ain't whatcha think it is) and
Russ ("Liar") Ballard’s "Chained
are the top listening bets. The
deluxe package also includes sev-
en 7“ x 10"’ playing cards to decor-
ate one’s walls.

RASPBERRIES (Capital)-—The
best thing about this album is the
sticker on the front cover that
smells of raspberries. The only
good song is “Please Go All the '
Way,” a Top-40-type tune that
is about exactly what you think it .
is about. A generally inoffensive
album for listening without con
centrating. ’

Dillards ROOTS AND
BRANCHES (Anthem) —- Another
goodie fom one of the older
“folk” (for lack of a better wrd)
groups, though not quite up to
the quality of some of their ear-
lier albums. Their single “One
AM.” is especially good; their
interpretation of “Man of Con-
Jstant Sorrow” especially amateur-
fish. Don’t waste your money un-
lless you’re a Dillards freak.

Thesbions to Present

J.P. Sartre’s ‘No Exit’

Jean Paul Sartre’s “No Exit” will
be presented on Friday. Septem-
ber 29 at 8:30 p.m.. in the Studio
Teatre. Someone sitting in the
audience not familiar with the
play might find its setting rather
unique—it all takes place in hell.

Sartre’s idea of hell, however,
is miles from that held by many
people. The playwright offers a
vision of hell as a French drawing
room with Second Empire furn-
ishings, and a perfectly balanced
group of three “in-mates.”

_ Layne Williams, student director
of the play, speaks freely about her
interpretation of Sartre’s master-
piece: "the play is based on bal-
ance-—everything is balanced. The
characters are balanced. The set-
ting is balanced.

“But this symetry does not bring
order to their existence. It reminds
me of a quote from Bernard Mal- '
amud. something to the effect of:
‘Madness does not upset the
world conscience does."

Layne also points out that the
play is a statement of Sartre’s bas-
ic belief that “you are what you
do, not what you intend.” Through-
out the play, each of the char-
acters tries to face-up to himself-
to his own actions-—but fails.

Dates for the show are Septem-
ber 29 and 30 at 8:30 p.m.. Octo-
ber 1 at 2:30 p.m.. and October 6
and 7 at 8:30 p.m. Admission is
$1.00. Reservations may be made
by calling ext. 314, weekdays. 3-5
p.m. The Studio Theatre. a stu-
dent organization for Pitt stud-
ents, is located in the basement
of the Cathedral.

 

album is a disappointment musi-
cally; of course, to me, nothing
comes close to Volunteers. The
lyrics here are all_ strong, though,
and incisive—especially “Eat
Starch Mom” and “Easter.” Gra-
cie’s wails are a bit much, unless
you like Gracie’s wails. The cov-
‘er folds into a nice stash box.

J Stern Displays

By ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Due to his worldwide reputa-
tion, the name of violinist Isaac
Stern is one which is known even
"by those who have never step
foot within a concert hall. During
this past weekend, the renown-
_ ‘ed Stern made one of his frequent
_ appearancs with the Pittsburgh
Symphony under William Stein-
,. berg, offering two divergent con-
 certi from the repertoire.

' Beginning with the Mozart
. “Concerto No. One”, Stern spun
/  a tone of pure gold as he made his
 way through the three short move-
 ments. Included at the end «of
each section of.the work was a
 concise cadenza which was bea'u-
”*tifully proportioned in regard to
_§2 its respective movement.

, . While we were certainly grate-
' jgful to hear one of the rarer Mo-
zart concerti, the overall charac-

- _ ter of the work was so reserved
 .. that an almost dreamlike atmos-
- 1 phere pervaded the hall. Quite
_ . unlike the fiery nature of the well
A’ known “Turkish Concerto"
which was written in the same
year (1775), the “First Concerto”

 pecting virtuosic gymnastics. It
 admittedly requires precision and
 careful thought, but hardly makes
“7, ‘great technical demands upon the
artist. '

. Stern’s second offering was one
of the treasures of the atonal re-
_pertoire, the Berg “Violin Con-
erto” of 1935, More accessible

 and more digestable than many '

 works inspired by the twelve tone
’ '-.X_I‘OW_, the composition is almost

lyrical and is laced with passages
of tranquil beauty.

/Although there were. instances

ed a less-than smooth rendition of

  

3 iiagé 8;-THE‘ PITT NEWS—Monday, September 25,1972

I-disappoints those who are ex-‘

some phrases, Stern proved him-
self a match for the intricate tech-
nicalities of the work.

Perhaps the most disappoint-
ing aspect of Stern’s appearance
was his dependence upon music
rather'than memory. A virtuoso
with a music stand before him cer-

_ tainly seemsless impressive than

one who has no need of one. The
shock is all the greater when one
of the world’s greatest violinists
requires music for not only a sta-
ple of the modern repertoire but
for a Mozart concerto as well.

As I have never heard Stern
perform these two works in the
concert hall prior to this pro-
gram, I assume that he has done
them without his musical “crutch”
sometime in the past.

-Not surprisingly,‘ there was no *

standing ovation following Ster'n’s

-performances. This, of course, in .

no way reflects an unsatisfactory
rendition on the part of the sol-
oist, but rather reflects the de-
meanor of Pittsburgh audiences. ,

Had the audience heard the

= Beethoven or Brahms concertos,

it would have jumped up at the

first opportunity; but even after’

almost 40 years, the Berg concer-

to falls uneasily upon Pittsburgh- ,

ers’ ears.

The concerti (which came at the
middle of the program) were flank-
ed by two concert hall favorites
which have been heard on our
symphony programs more often

.,than we would care to admit. Op-

ening the concert was a rendition
of Mozart’s “Jupiter” Symphony
which exuded little warmth due
to an overly “academic” approach
on the- conductor’s part. Only
with the finale did the opus ulti-
mum of the Mozart symphonic
catalogue show any signs of bright-
ening. ‘

  Virtuosity

   

Ravel’s “La Valse”, a work which
becomes more worn with each
hearing, closed out the program.
If one questions how such
“schmaltz” finds its way onto
our symphony programs,one
need only gauge audience ap-
plause after the performance of
such a work to know the reason
why.

Pittsburgh audiences know what
they like and it is because of their
unimaginative tastes that we all
must suffer such worn composi-
tional attempts as this.

Shriver Speaks ’_

(Continued from Page 1)

Shriver referred to a bill which
Plashinsky had introduced into
the House. Shriver praised the
bill as an attempt to encourage
ethnic pride.

“And it should be no surprise to
you to know that Plashinski is a
Democrat. It should also be no
surprise to you to know that every,
Pole in the House with the ex-
ception of one, is a Democrat, and
every black representative in the
House is a Democrat.” ‘

Shriver explained that the rea-
son for this was simplistic.

I “The Democratic party always
had open membership. We have
always solicited membership
from all races, all creeds.

We ~don’t want to re-elect the
rich and snooty. We want to put
the people back in the White
House. Everyone register and
vote in November for McGovern
and Shriver.”

Shriver moved quickly off the

.stage, flanked by secret service

agents.

McLaughlin,t orchestra
Delight Music Devotees

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Friday at 6:33 P.M. the sun arrived at the first of Libra as it cross- V

ed the northern equinoctial point at the intersection of the ecliptic
and celestial equators. Saturday night, about 27 hours later, John Mc-
Laughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra appeared at Soldiers and Sail-
ors Memorial Hall.

It was not insignificant that McLaughlin and company were here
so shortly after the autumnal equinox occurred. Both represent dis-

4"?’

tinctive evolutions—one seasonal, the other musical, but both mental I

and highly majestic.‘

Indeed it is beyond-comprehension that any music enthusiast’

could attend a McLaughlin and Orchestra concert without undergo-
ing a spiritual progression. From the moment the group began with

' “You Know You Know,” everyone’s mind was captivated.
McLaughlin displayed brilliance whether he performed on his

electric double neck or on his six-string acoustic. He showed that he is
more than a good guitarist but an artistic innovator.

But the Orchestra works as a functional unit, so people who‘

came to see solely McLaughlin were also enthralled by the other
members as well.

Jerry Goodman may be the best violinist in avant garde music
today. He plays faster than any electric fiddler on record and even in-
vents his own scales. Particularly arrestingwere his dialogues with
pianist Jan Hammer, an outstanding keyboardist, in which Goodman
would pick his fiddle in a bluesy-jazzish fashion, and Hammer would

’ respond with his energic dynamics. _

Drummer Billy Cobham has gained a reputation for being as good
a percussionist as Tony Williams and Carl Palmer. He was most im-

pressive with his solo in “You Know You Know”, during which he‘

exhibited amazing speed and rhythm.

Rick Laird demonstrated that he is more than just an ordinary bagj

sist. Not only did he provide a firm foundation to support upper the
layers of music, but he also came to the forefront for imaginative leads.

Together this combination of geniuses performed extended sel-
ections from their first album, The Inner Mounting Flame. They were
sensational in whatever they played, but most fascinating were the
rock-bluesish oriented “Dance Of The Maya”~- and “Meeting Of The
Spirits.” _ '

In‘ their presentation, the Orchestra utilized no gimmicks, but
rather they simply performed their material. Theyneed no trivial dis-
tractions, for their ability to emit waves of warmth and love is suffi-
cient.

Unfortunately, the acoustics were less than desirable, and the
musicians were constantly plagued with technical difficulties. Neverthe-
less, with their all-pervading power and splendor, they were able to
transcend these imperfections. / ' .

“We fumbled the ball right off

continued fumbling the whole

team’s humiliating loss to Air
Force.

The air tended to make an Oakland sports writers throat
raw. The scent in that air, though not quite describable, made

his eyes wa ter.

Amist this post card- atmosphere, the Pitt Panther foot-
ball team did their darndest to prove they were not a good
football team, despite some admirable play in their first two

contests.

i_ At the foot of Rampart Range. in Falcon Stadium -dug
into the ground like a Roman Colloseum, the Panthers played
what was supposed to be their first win of the 1972 season.

Saturday’s ballgame as bad as American stategians have
handled a most unpopular war in South East Asia.

Turning the ball over with great consistency, the Pan-
thers played the role of the helpless Christian in the big bad

city of Rome.

“I.still believe we can have a good football team—pro-
viding we get .maximum effort out of the personnel we

have in there,” said a relaxed Carl DePasgua enroute back to

Pittsburgh. “It would have been a much closer gamehad we
not committed so many mistakes. We are going to continue to
coach them into eliminating these things. That’s all coach-
ing is repetition, nothing but repetition.” .

To DePasqua’s dismay, his players followed his phil-
osophy, different then the coach would have liked. They re-
peatedly fumbled, fumbled, and fumbled again.

It was not DePasqua that. committed those turnovers. Carl
wouldn’t wish that upon his" worst enemy._ They happened
nonetheless, and the Pitt players lost the game.

Maybe if all those Pitt runners realize that this is the"

thirdgame of the season, the improved Pitt defense could get
a rest now and then. Maybe if one of the quarterbacks would

decide to take over, the offense could

As the third quarter of the game came to a close. and
the same sports writer looked out above the stadium. he real-
ized that his eyes_were becoming even more waterv.

This time, however, it was not the Colorado air that was

iga/using the discomfort. It was the feces likeodor ascend-
ing from the floor of Falcon Stadium, made possible by the

needless Pitt play.

i Even though no one really knows what to expect thsrest of
the season, the head coach is not giving up on his term. He
realzes that things could fall apart, but he also knows things
could turn for the better. It could have just been a bad day.

- A win against a Northwestern team this Saturday could make

a lot of amends.

It will be the Pitt gridders who will do it though, one
way or the other. It will be they who will have to put on
their jock straps for the rest of the games. If they are foot-
ball-players like their name implies, they will start acting like
the team they have shown they can be. '

After nine plays the Falcons
were unable to penetrate the Cat’s
defense and settled for a field
goal which put them on the boards
for the first time of the after-

The other extremely disasterous -

Bill Englert fumbled on the Pitt

Steve Heil to "grab, and within
minutes the Falcons had an-

The fumble also worked to de-
stroy the Panthers’ own scoring

  West Chester Ties Pill :0
On Rare Penalty Kick

by.li3art Mack

It took a goal on an infre-
quently called‘ penalty kick for
West Ches-State College to come
from behind and tie Pitt in a
game that went into double over-
time at Pitt Stadum Saturday.

The call was made at the 25
minute mark of the second half
with Pitt in the lead, 1-0. The
officials ruled that Denny Kohl-
meyer played a shot on goal
with his hands, thus giving West
Chester the free kick.

Panther goalie Bill Haines had
absolutely no chance on the shot
which went up into the top of
right hand corner. After the
game, Kohlmeyer refuted the
vofficial’s call, claiming "that the
ball played him” and that he
did not intentionally play the‘ ball

’ with his hands.

20 Minutes earlier, Joe Lux-
bacher gave the booters a 1-0
lead after being frustrated con-
tinually by the West Chester

‘Ben Martin described as “our

134 yards rushing on 30 attempts
for one TD and flagged down two
aerials for a total of 23 yards.

Only one of Pitt’s TD’s threat-

' ened the Air Force’s supremacy in

the game. John Hogan com-
pleted two passes to ou Cecconi
who broke away for a 74 yard
run and a touchdown. This was
accomplished with only 1:30
left on the clock in the second
quarter and narrowed the Fal-
cons lead to 13-7.

DePasqua had very little ‘to

defeat at the hands of the Fal-
cons. ‘

“They (Air Force) controlled
the football in the third quarter

to get back in the game (dur-
ing one drive in this period the
Falcons consumed 7:17 minutes

mendous opportunities in .the
first half but couldn’t capitalize
on them.

Pre-game predictions ca_me true
in the opening minutes as both
squads came out hitting. But the
Panthers proved that they could
play West Cheaters type of game
and A made their presence felt
whenever they could.

West Chester started out with
strong offensive pressure for a
few minutes it seemed as if
the booters were in for a long
afternoon. But the veteran Pitt
defensive unit played brilliantly
and the Panthers came right
back. ’

Both squads then continued to
exchange the momentum through-
out the remainder of .the first
half. Al Jutca had a golden op-
portunity with only one minute
to play but couldn’t find the
range. '

Luxbacher finally found the-nets

with an assist from Bob Kohlmey-v

er at the five minute mark of the
second half. Kohlmeyer took the
ball into the left wing and headed
it over to Luxbacher. who was
cruising in front of the net. Lux-
bacher wasted no time and fired
it into the left corner.

West Chester battled back im-
mediately with fierce pressure

that lasted for over 10 minutes. -

Their best chance came on one of
their few challenging shots on
Haines.

Pitt began to gain back the mo-
mentum but then the penalty
kick was called. The goal capped
the West Chester attack and the

In Letter

Editor's Note: The following is a
letter to the sports editor. We hope
that Mr. Bemis and the intramural
supply an answer.
Also, we hope for further letters,
whether announcing a gripe or
making some point.

Dear Sir:

I was just going to accept the
fact that the Pitt intramural pro-
gram is run incompetently. Rath-
er than voice my objections. I
thought I'd just shrug my should-
ers, and walk away. However.
your article on Mr. Bemis
prompts this letter. Mr. Bemis is
incompetent as head of intramur-
al athletics. Scheduled to play a
softball game at 7 p.m. we await-
ed the “turning on of the lights“
until 8 p.m. The game was played
in semi—darkness which set in at
7:15 and the opposing team walk-
ed off the field at 7:50 because it
was impossible to see. Why was
the game scheduled if the lights
weren’t functioning? Where was
Mr. Bemis? What decision will be
made concerning the outcome of
the game? By what procedure?

I must admit Mr. Bemis is con-
sistent. The basketball program
is run with the lack of skill. I play-
ed in three games last year where
but one referee was present. He
found the games very interesting
by watching them from midcourt
with his arms folded. Perhaps he
lacked the propensity to gather
his breath together to blow his
whistle.

The Pitt junior varsity team
lost its opening game of the sea-
son against Virginia. but in the
long run. they probably will bene-
fit much more than the baby
Mountaineers. The final-score
was 17-13‘.

“I told the boys it didn’t matter
‘ how they played. as long as they
won." stated WVU Coach George
"Duke” Henshaw. He proceeded
to use only his top team. and it did
manage to squeak out a victory.

Pitt opened the scoring with a
76 yard. scoring drive, aided by a
WVU fumble of a Bob Viellette
punt. The 11 play drive was high-
lighted by repeated long gains by
Don Siegle, and was climaxed by
Mike Mehalik’s four-yard TD run.
Greg Luther added the extra point.

M'|KE MEHALIK
‘Scored TD for JV’s

The first quarter ended with no
further scoring, but West Virginia
tied the score with a touchdown
of their own in the second period.
The score was set up by a 44 yard
punt return by Mark Burke, to the
Pitt 30 yard line and six plays-
later Mountie quarterback Ben
Williams, Jr. snuck the ball in
from the one-yard line.

Soccer style kicker Emil Ross.
who almost won the varsity job.
added the extra-point to tie the
score. The half ended scoreless.
with Ross missing a 39 yard field
goal at the gun.

Pitt received the second half
kick—off, and with Don Herold re-
placing Rich Washinko at quarter-
back, the Cubs marched 75 yards
for their second touchdown. with
Herold going up the middle from
one yard out to score. The extra-
point attempt was wide.

Siegle injured his left arm in the ‘

first half, but Cal Branch and Ted.
Berrien teamed up to take Pitt
down the field. The two even team-
ed up on a fumble to pick up seven
yards, with Berrien fumbling and
Branch recovering on the WVU
one.

Neither team was able to mount
much of an attack as ‘the third
quarter ended and West Virginia
finally pulled close when Ross
booted a 35 yard field goal early
in the fourth quarter.

, With Washinko back at quarter-
back, Tom Florence intercepted a
-pass, the only pickoff of the game.
With the ball on the Pitt 27 after
the interception return, Williams
swept around right end to score
on third and goal from the four.
after several attempts were stop-

 

 

ped cold.

“Williams begged me to run
that play,” enthused Henshaw, “I
told him that if he didn’t score not
to bother coming back to the
bench. His replie was “Watch me
coaeh.”’

Pitt tried to rally. but couldn’t
get the passing game to click. Fin-
ally. late in the game. Herald
threw a pass to Mehalik. who was
smashed by a baby Mountie just
as the ball got to him. The official
amazingly called it a fumble.
which West Virginia recovered.
Even the admittedly biased WVU
press box couldn’t believe the call.

_The Baby Mounties could not

score though, but time ran out on
Pitt. The game ended with WVU

on top, 17-13, and with the statis- '

tics just short of amazing.

West Virginia ‘running back
Dwayne Woods carried the ball 33
times, yet netted only 71 yards,
barely two yards per carry. The
only other Mountie to carry the
ball was quarterback Williams,
who ran 11 times fori 56 yards.

The WVU passing was‘ similar.
with Williams throwing almost
exclusively to wide receiver Brad
Haines, who caught just four of 16
passes. Williams passed 25 times
but due to excellent coverage by
the Pitt secondary, was only able
to complete seven.

Washinko and Herold passed
only 11 times, with four comple-

 

  Baby Mom-es Edge Jayvees, 17-73 

tions. Don Siegle had a perfect
passing day. one for one. throw-
ing an option pass to Mehalik.

Pitt concentrated much more
on the ‘running game and used
many different players to amass
a total of 170 yards on the ground.
Just like the varsity, several of-
fenses were used, including the
Wishbone.

West Virginia got their wish.
winning the game. but Pitt got all
of their players into the game and
got much more of what junior var-
sity games are for. experience
and a good look at many players.

CREATEVE .

We evaluated about 20 brands of lowcost speak-
ers by the same critical standards we use for
our high end lines. The creatives delivered it
all the best.

SHERWOOD 7050

Virginia University were bitten by the audio bug. like many audiophiites, we were
‘unable to find any st_ores where we could really rap about all the products and still
receive swinging prices when it came time to buy. As a result, we found ourselves
going out of state for the best deals.

Having gone the route ourselves, we were determined to change all of this with
the Audio Warehouse. Unlike most Warehouse operations, ours would offer com-
plete demonstration facilities and professional guidance. Yet, with only a few ex-
ceptions, the prices you pay would be the some or" gthan the wholesale prices
the small dealer pays for equivalent quantities.

If you come to the Audio Warehouse and inquire about a component or system,
you'll receive sensible guidance. If the product you ask for is not in_our opinion the
best value, we'll inform you of a better alternative rather than making an easy
sale—yet we feel theultimate decision should rest with the customer and there-

fore, we don’t believe in pushing our customers into buying our choice of compo-’

nents. Everyone of the Audio Warehouse is iust as willing to spend time with the

,. person looking for the best $200 system as we are with those looking-for the best

$2000 system because we can all remember the excitement of selecting our first
system and who knows, if we can make that $200 system exciting enough you
may be bitten by the audio bug like we were. .

       
      

We need audio salesmen full and part-time. If you're already into hi-fi or have some
knowledge and a desire to learn more, you may be the one we're looking for.

If you'd like to arrange for an interview, call 884-8797.

The EPI 50 loudspeakers are compared with 14

The Sherwood 7l0O A provides unmatched per-

SHERWOOD 7200

If it sounds like we’re on a Sherwood kick, it's
because we are. Sherwood’s goal with their
new '73 line was to provide the best value in
each price range. What other receiver priced un-
der $300 can deliver 40 RMS/channel with a 1.8
FM sensitivity and includes a walnut case?

This receiver combines tuner and amplifier per-
formance that could easily form the heart of a
system that would sell for $100-$200 more, and
combines with the creative speakers offers a
level of performance distinctly superior to com-
parably priced Sony or Panasonic compacts.
