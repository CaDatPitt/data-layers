LCB, bars admit problems  

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

Underage drinking in Oakland bars
has been a problem for quite some
time, but in recent weeks it has drawn
more attention. '

Earlier this month, both Peter’s Pu
and the Sanctuary were hit with suspen-
sions by the Pennsylvania Liquor Con-
trol Board. Peter’s Pub was given a
10-day suspension, and the Sanctuary
was closed from Dec. 27 to Jan. 3. In
both cases, the closings were due to
charges stemming from the sale of
alcohol to underage patrons.

The suspensions of the bars,
however, give rise to several questions.
Do the sanctions reﬂect the true con-
ditions in the establishments? And, are
the penalties fair?

According to Robert Ford, press
secretary for the LCB, the answer to
both these questions is yes ——.a definite
yes. _

"There is an obvious problem with
underage drinking in the area.” said
Ford. “But also there is a problem with
enforcing the penalties once we have
given them out. Getting from the en-
forcement to the final action is
somewhat difficult. -

“We think the penalties are fair, but
many times the decisions are overruled
by the courts,” said Ford.

Ford, cited several examples. The
Sanctuary was given a 14-day suspen-
sion by the LCB, but it was reduced

Dean Rosenberg to retire soon

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, the current
dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS), will resign from his
position on July 1, 1986, after serv-
ing 17 years at Pitt as dean.

Rosenberg started at Pitt in 1953
as a faculty member in chemistry. By
the summer of ’69 he was the chair-
man of biophysics and microbiology.
Then, in the fall of ’69 he became
the FAS dean.

Rosenberg and the FAS started at
almost the same time. The FAS had
been formed in the fall of ’67 and
was just starting to be fully
developed. Prior to Rosenberg’s
becoming dean, there were three
separate divisions in FAS: the natural
sciences, the social sciences and the
humanities. Each department had its
own dean.

As the dean of FAS, Rosenberg
worked to merge the three divisions,
which together form the intellectual
and artistic core of the university.
Rosenberg is in charge of over 30
academic departments with 580 full-
time faculty serving 8,000 full-time
undergraduates and 1,300 full-time
graduate students.

Jeanne Martin, Rosenberg’s ex-
ecutive secretary, has worked for
him for 17 years and said she knows
him better than most. She describes
herself as a ‘ ‘sort of troubleshooter. ’ ’
She is in (“barge of scheduling ap-
pointments and making various ar-
rangements for Rosenberg. .

 

The undergraduate dean of CAS,
Irwin Schulman, and graduate dean
Elizabeth Baranger, also work with
Rosenberg on a regular basis.
Rosenberg is the senior of the three
deans and they must go to him with
questions regarding policy making
and budget requests.

“There is a lot of interaction
among the three deans,” said
Schulman. “We have separate duties
but we’ see each other at le_ast three
times a week. We are all aware of
what the other is doing. I guess you
could say we work together
harmoniously. ’

“I think in our case we are lucky
because it just worked out that the
three deans get along extremely well.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but
we are, I think, good friends,” said
Schulman. “We have differences of
opinion, but we resolve them well.”

Rosenberg has many respon-
sibilities as the top dean of FAS. He
provides and allocates resources
among the departments and helps
them plan academic programs. He
also presides over the faculty and ap-
points each department chairman.

The amount of "responsibility that,

comes with being the dean of FAS
is immense for one person.
Rosenberg said that when he first
became the dean he had considered
having three executive deans under
him in the divisions of natural
science, social science and
humanities.

“I decided that there were too
many important advantages in hav-
ing only one dean,” said Rosenberg.

“Someone would ultimately have to

make the decisions and having ex-'

ecutive deans would only add layers
that the faculty would have to go‘
through.

“I think that the dean can use help

‘to perform certain’ functions,”

Rosenberg said. “Maybe the ‘next
dean will find it to his advantage to
have deans under him in the different
divisions, but I did not choose to do

’ it that way.”

“Rosenberg has interests in all
three divisions,” said Martin. “He-
knows. what’s going on in all of
them. He never drops the ball on
anything.”

Jim Maher, chairman of the dean A

search committee, agrees ‘with Mar-
tin. “Rosenberg keeps a close con-
tact with all three divisions. It’s in-
credible what all he can cover,” he
said. I

Rosenberg said he feels that put-
ting together the three divisions has
led to a good intellectual mix. He
views this as one of the important
changes which occurred in his ad-
ministration. Rosenberg can also
recall many other changes which
have occurred.

Early in the ’70s the curriculum
became less structured. Many re-
quirements were abolished, such as
the foreign language and writing

requirements.
“I feel that this was due to the ac-
tivism of the times,” said

Rosenberg. “The whole mood of the

country was changing. Students felt

that their rights were being violated
continued on page 3

to seven days after a lengthy process
in the courts.

Also, The Wooden Kegfnow known
as C.J. Barney's, was given suspen-

' sions on two separate occasions — on-

ly to have both overruled by the courts.
In 1983, the LCB gave the Keg a
20-day suspension. It was reduced in
the courts to a $500 fine. In 1982.

“There is an obvious
problem with underage
drinking in the area. But
also, there -is a problem
with enforcing the
penalties once we have
given them out. ”

— Robert Ford, LCB

the Keg was hit with a 10-day suspen-
sion that was completely overturned by
the court, which cited a technicality as
the reason.

Ford would not speculate on why the
courts tend to overrule so many of the
LCB’s citations. However. he did say
that the constant superseding of their
judgments does present a problem for
the LCB. ,

“Any time we revoke a license of a
bar, the courts can automatically
supersede,” said Ford. “The licensee
can appeal to the courts, and we can’t
do anything until it is appealed by the
courts.

“There are a lot’ of cases in
Allegheny County where the decisions.
are reversed. We’ve had cases where
there are deﬁnite minors getting caught

and the courts supersede.”
According to Ford, although the
LCB is sometimes handcuffed in its ac-
tions, the district attorney’s office is not
bound by the same constraints.
“The district attorney has power we
don‘t have."said Ford. “If people are

upset enough about a bar, they can go .
. to the D.A.’s office, and he can take

the establishment to court right away;
the judge can padlock the place the very
next day.

“There is a definite need for an ac-
tive local district attorney and active
assistants."

However, according to the
Allegheny County District Attorney’s
Office. the responsibility for enforcing

the legal drinking age falls in the

jurisdiction of the LCB.

“It is the LCB’s responsibility to in-
vestigate and enforce the laws,” said
Robert Vincler. a spokesman for the
district attorney‘s office. “We don’t get
involved with the rules and regulations,
but we do act as legal advisors and get
involved with the violation of state laws
— such as operating without a license
and corrupting the morals of minors.”

So. while the question of whose
responsibility it is continues to be ban-
died about, the burden ultimately falls

on the bars. To some, however, ‘that g _ A

responsibility is too great.

“The LCB wants us to do their job,”
said Bob Bonesso, manager for Peter’s
Pub. “They want to put all the polic-
ing on the bars, but we can’t do
everything." ,

Bonesso believes the job of keeping
all underage drinkers out of the bars is
much too difficult for the bars to han-
dle alone. And, with the advent of im-

Bicentennial plan

under way

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Come next February, the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh will be celebrating its
200th birthday. The event does not
figure to go unnoticed, according to
David Schwartz, the coordinator of the
Bicentennial celebration.
already on the drawing board, moving
along quite rapidly now,” Schwartz
said.

“One of the events will feature the
association of American Universities —
Dr. -Posvar has invited this group
[which is comprised of representatives
from the 56 most prestigious research
universities in the nation] to hold their
next meeting at Pitt next October, ” he
said. “We’re also planning a Bicenten-
nial Ball for Feb. 28, 1987 (Founder’s
Day). In March, Phipps Conservatory
is dedicating its Spring Flower Show
to Pitt.”

The Bicentennial department has a
few somewhat tenative plans for the
third round of activities, which are

scheduled to occur as late as May,

1987. During the week of Commence-
ment,-‘ Schwartz hopes to be able to

“Much is .

for 1987 

coordinate a Global Restoration Sym-' ,

posium, in which the international
economic effects of the shift of com-
merce and industry to the U.S. West
Coast will be discussed. ,

How all of this will be paid for, ac-
cording to Schwartz, appears uncertain
at this time.

“At this point, we are exploring all
sources of funding,” he said. “We
hope contributions from various
sources will take care of this. These
grants might come from anywhere '—
the alumni, major corporations, etc.”

Schwartz also pointed out-that all
events are scheduled to occur during
the 1986-87 academic year, despite the
fact that the University’s actual 200th
birthday is not until February, 1987.
He believes that concentrating the
festivities will make things appear more
consistent. '

Other departments also are prepar-

ing for the celebration. According to A

maintenance director Ken Soergel, one
of the motivations behind the Depart-
ment of Physical Plant’s renovation of
the Cathedral grounds was the forth-
corriing anniversary. “With the univer-

._ sity’s Bicentennial coming up,” said

Soergel, “we wanted to add a bit of
new landscape to the campus.”

Philadelphia Orchestra  
invited to perform in U.S.S.R.

PHILADELPHIA — The Soviet
Union has invited the Philadelphia Or-
chestra to perform four concerts there
this spring, making the musicians the
first American orchestra to receive an
invitation since the Geneva Summit.
The invitation comes as a result of the
series of cultural accords signed by
President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev during last
November’s summit. The agreements
marked the beginning of the exchange
of cultural events that had been stopped
in response to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan in 1979.

Judith Karp, spokesman for the
Philadelphia Orchestra, said the or-
chestra, under the direction of music
director Riccardo Muti, has been in-
vited to play two concerts in Moscow
and two in Leningrad in May and June.
The last time the orchestra visited the
U.S.S.R. was in 1958 as a part of the
cultural exchange program negotiated
by President Dwight D. Eisenhower
and Nikita Khruschev.

Italy issues
warrant for Nidal

ROME —— Italy moved against
Palestine guerilla leader Abu Nidal. An
international arrest warrant has been

issued by a prosecutor in Rome, charg-
ing Nidal with responsibility for the
Dec. 27 attack at Rome’s airport that
killed 16 people. Nidal was aboard the
Egyptian airliner that U.S. jets forced
down over Sicily after the Achille
Lauro hijacking in October, but Italy
refused to detain him then.

Reagan pushes
sale of Conrail

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan geared up for a fight to gain
a Senate OK for the proposed $1.2
billion sale of government-owned Con-
rail. Reagan told a group of business
leaders that the planned sale of the
freight line to Norfolk Southern is a
“test to see if Congress is serious”
about cutting the deﬁcit. Reagan has
called Conrail a costly activity that the
government should never have gotten
involved with in the first place.

Reagan’s pitch for approval of the
Norfolk Southern bid was countered
yesterday by Morgan Stanley, a New
York investment banking house that is
also seeking to buy Conrail. Morgan
Stanley intensified its efforts to derail
the sale to Norfolk Southern by an-
nouncing changes that sweetened its
$1.4 billion offer to Conrail.

Militias challenge
Gemayel stronghold

LEBANON — The mountain
stronghold of Lebanese President
Gemayel was‘ the target of tank assaults
by Syrian-backed leftist militias yester-
day. The Lebanese army was able to
force the tanks to retreat. One thousand
militia fighters had massed for what
they called the “decisive battle” to
force Gemayel out of office. Mean-
while, the signers of the now-defunct
Lebanese peace agreement met in Syria
for further discussions.

Space probe
reaches Uranus

Scientists are making new
discoveries about Uranus as the
Voyager 2 space probe closed to within
one million miles of the planet.
Engineers sent a series of key com-
mands to Voyager’s computers to
prepare for a rendezvous with the
planet and its many moons today.
Voyager sent back pictures yesterday
showing the first clouds ever seen in
the planet’s atmosphere and well-
organized spots that scientists say
resemble immense storms.

Panel urges
tighter security

WASHINGTON — A Senate panel
called for reform in security clearance
procedures concerning “secret” and
“top secret” papers. The Senate Per-
manent Investigations Subcommittee
said sweeping changes are needed in
the way the government grants securi-

v ty clearances. In a long-awaited report

issued Wednesday, senators urged the
White House to cut the number of peo-
ple with clearances by one-half within
two years. Currently, 4.3 million peo-
ple have some access to the nation’s
secrets.

The report also called for periodic in-
vestigations of those with security
clearances and a decrease‘ in the
number of classified documents
stamped “secret” and “top-secret."
The ‘committee held hearings on the
subject following the arrests of a
number of government employees on
espionage charges last year.

The newly-elected Student
Government board met for the first
time Wednesday and discussed
Pitt’s involvement in the Alliance
of Pennsylvania Student
Governments.

The recently—created coalition
consists of student government
representatives from seven Penn-

Pitt’s SGB joins state alliance

sylvania- schools, including Penn
State University and Temple
University. The first meeting of the
alliance occurred in Harrisburg in
mid-December. At that meeting,
SGB member Andy Bacallao was
elected to the position of vice chair-
man for the alliance.

“The purpose of the alliance is
to collectively voice higher educa-
tion issues,” said Bacallao. SGB
President Jim Mum_ma added that

inounced the recommendation of

the alliance will provide a more ef-
fective lobbying tool in the state
legislature.

. In other business, Mumma an-

Randy Meck for the position of
chairman for the Student Relations
Committee. which oversees the
SGB’s publicity and public rela-
tions. The board subsequently ac-
cepted the recommendation
unanimously. "

Rosenb

 

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg
by having to take required courses.

“Then, when the Vietnam War
wound down, students became con-
cerned with national and social
issues. In the ’80s there was a rever-
sal and more courses were added to
the undergraduate curriculum. I feel
that this helps the students to broaden
their horizons and become better in-
dividuals,” said Rosenberg.

Many new departments have also
been added over the years. To start
a new department, initiative must
first be shown. Rosenberg said that

the administration cannot create a-

department on its own. ‘ ‘We send the
proposal to the university council,
then it goes to the president and then
to the board of trustees,” said
Rosenberg.

For example, in the spring of ’69,
during a student protest movement,
a challenge was brought to the ad-
ministration to develop a black
studies program.

“This was unusual because it hap-
pened under such fiery cir-

cumstances,” Rosenberg said, “but

it was approved and now we have the '

Department of Black Studies.”

Another new department, which is
the only one of its kind, is the
Department -of Crystallography.
Rosenberg feels that this ‘program
has made a lot of progress since it
originated. '

There is also the new Department
of Religious Studies. “We worked
over a period of four to five years
and now we have a small but in-
teresting -department,” said
Rosenberg. .

Another change occurred when
the small Department of Astronomy
was merged with the larger physics
department. Rosenberg said that this
has led to an improvement in the
astronomy department.

Three departments in biological
sciences have also been merged. The
result, according to Rosenberg, has
been a better quality in teaching and
research. . .

Some departments have also been

split off or eliminated. The history
and the philosophy of science
became separate from the regular
history department. Theater arts was
separated from speech and theater
arts, and the geography department
was eliminated.

All the departments are required to
be involved in research or creative
activity.

“Each department has the dual
mission of creating as well as of
teaching,” said Rosenberg. “A
department is never stronger than its
faculty, and the better the faculty, the
better the quality of incoming
students.”

Regarding the question of how the
budget is distributed, Rosenberg
said, “I allocate the money where I
see it to be needed.”

Rosenberg still has a number of
goals for FAS. He feels that there is
too much fragmentation in the
literature department and would like
to see a graduate study program
there.

Rosenberg would also like to
highlight the humanities to make
them more visible. “The natural

~ sciences have their labs and separate

buildings, the social sciences have
their common concerns but the
humanities are scattered,” said
Rosenberg. “It’s also harder for the
humanities to receive outside money.
They don’t receive government
funds like the two sciences."

Rosenberg plans to stay on at Pitt
after his retirement as the dean of
FAS. He will be back in the fall to
teach an upper-level undergraduate
course in biochemistry. '

Provost Roger Benjamin came to
Pitt two-and-a—half years ago from
the University of Minnesota and has
enjoyed working with Rosenberg.
“As far as I can tell, the university
owes Rosenberg gratitude for the job
he’s done over the past 17 years,”
said Benjamin. “The quality of the
departments in structure and research
has improved.

“Since I’ve been here, not only
have we had a good relationship as
dean and provost but he’s also helped
me as an outsider by giving me ad_—
vice,” said Benjamin. “It’s my job
to sometimes challenge the deans and
he has responded graciously. I would
say that he’s deﬁnitely a class act.”

Campus Of
. The Future

Last Friday the Mellon—Pitt-Carnegie Corp. was

I ofﬁcially awarded a grant of nearly $40 million.

This grant is part of $70 million that has. been raised
to build the proposed supercomputing center.
Although there is nothing wrong with owning the
fastest, most powerful and most expensive computer
going, Pitt’s enthusiastic involvement in this enor-

mous endeavor sends yet another confusing message

to the university community and those involved with
it. , -
In addition to the Campus of the Future, expan-
sion of Pitt medical facilities and more visible ex-
cesses like landscaping the Cathedral lawn, we will
now have supercomputers. Supercomputers, accor-
ding to President Posvar, are “yet another strong
indication of the increasing prominence of the
University of Pittsburgh and CMU as major
American research universities.” Statements like
these tend to leave your average student either with
stars. in his eyes and another bit for the letter home,
or with a question or two about how and when Pitt’s
new and now apparent prosperity will ﬁlter down
and improve the quality of education.

On the one hand we have grossly overcrowded
classrooms, not enough professors and severe fund-
ing cuts for every department that doesn’t turn a
profit. On the other hand we see a vast facade of
expensive gloss and technology. While much of this
equipment is also useful, it occurs to one quickly
that our university has vastly underestimated the
long—term worth of a well—developed human mind.

As things stand, each new supercomputer release
in the press is not so much an object of pride for
us, but a slap in our faces. Ironically so for those
in Pitt’s computer science department who, accor-
ding to a recent evaluative report, aren’t likely to
turn out people who will know how to use a super-
computer, let alone develop the next one.

Evil

I am writing this in response to the
editorial “Eternal Vigil." You state
that the Soviet Union is a passive power
similar to the United States, but have
you heard of a small backwards coun-
try called Afghanistan? The passive and
friendly Soviets have, in the last ﬁve
years, systematically wiped out six
million people there — roughly half of
that country’s population. For what
reason? Not because they are in any
way threatened by them, but because
it is a stepping-stone to Iran, which has
the warm water- port that the Soviets
haveicoveted for years.

This is all in addition to the missiles
sitting peacefully in Cuba (less than
three minutes from the Florida coast)
courtesy of our good friends — those
nutty Russians. I might even mention
the peaceful way that the Soviets shot
down the Korean Airlines ﬂight last
year, but we all know thatthey were
just protecting themselves from all
those fiendish tourists and  gasp 
businessmen. The Russian-backed
Khadafy regime and the missiles in
Syria are still another example of the
peaceful policies of the Kremlin.

The. truth is that the present-day
Soviet Union has a history of expan-
sionism dating back to the year 988
with St. Vladimir, continuing through
Alexander’s western expansion to the
Balkans in 1817. This expansionistic
tendency is still very much alive today.
To the “logic—twi,sting” individuals
responsible for the editorial in question,
I can only say: Get a grip on reality and
start paying attention to what our well-

Woes Snowball

Last Monday about two or three.

fraternities up on the hill engaged in
an innocent snowball ﬁght to com-
memorate the ﬁrst heavy snowfall. For
a while, everyone was having a hell of
a time until one of the participants was
arrested by an ofﬁcer of our illustrious
campus police on the charges of
“creating a public annoyance and
alarm by throwing snowballs into the
street at passing cars, and throwing a
snowball at an officer. ” As a result of
this childish game, one of my frater-
nity brothers was arrested and will have
to face the Judicial Board.

There were roughly 30 students who
witnessed the above mentioned inci-
dent. I feel confident that I speak for
all of them when I tell you snowballs
neither were thrown at cars on the
street, nor was a snowball directly and
intentionally thrown at the arresting
officer.

The incident illustrates just how
fouled up the campus police’s priori-
ties are. While the school’s officers
have been worrying about small. trivial
things, we, the residents of the frater-
nity houses on the hill, have had our

property stolen on three different oc- ‘

casions and have suffered numerous
violent assaults in the last two years.
The campus police should have better
and more important things to do than
bust students having a fun time with
each other. When will the campus
police start doing theirjob and ensure
security in an area that could be said

Frats’ Good Deeds

I would very much like to comment «

on the article “University Sanctions
Fraternity for Hazing.” I believe the
actions which occurred were very
unbecoming, but the situation must be.
brought into sharper focus.

In various articles over the years,
there has been an overemphasis on il-
lustrating the so-called “evil” sides and
failures of Greek organizations. Ar-
ticles ranging from the abolishment of»
fraternities to the presentation of
“animal house” atrocities have graced
the news pages. The puzzling thing is
that these observations came from peo-
ple who had no ﬁrsthand basis on
which to make such allegations.

During my educational experience,
critics called “frat” members arrogant,
imperial and showboats. But respect
was obtained in the long run for
achievements and accomplishments
which, to many within the university,
were overlooked. Those on the outside
looking in did not understand the
methods behind these striving con-
tributors to mankind.

Let the fair measure of an organiza-
ti0n’s value come from its good deeds
and contributions to the community,
rather than from the magnification-of
its shortcomings. There is never a men-
tion of the innumerable service projects
performed by these organizations.

Recently, several local and na-
tional groups have been trying to
deny women the right to have abor-
tions. They believe that abortion is
nothing less than murder. Are they
right? And if they are right, should
we, as a society, enact laws making
abortion illegal?

Those against abortion, or pro-
lifers, argue from a moral stand-
point. They say that in some stage
between conception and birth, in
the prenatal development of a baby,
life begins. After this point, abor-
tion is murder. However, there is
disagreement as to just when life
actually begins.

. Accordingly, those for the right
to have an abortion, or pro-
choicers, are quick to point out that
there is no conclusive scientific
evidence as to when life begins.

Most insist that in the early stage_s
of pregnancy, the fetus has not yet
developed the-physiological struc-

rures that deﬁne a living being. Will

The Devil ’s Advocate/Charles Ward
Abortioni A Moral Dilemma

this have any deleterious social
ramifications? Surely, countless
women would die of the type of il-
legal back-alley abortions that
disgraced our past.

But a pro-lifer might emphatical-
ly cry: Why should the unborn
child die for the mistakes of its
parents. In response, the pro-
choicers would say: How many un-
wanted children will this produce?
Think of it! If abortions become il-
legal, thousands of unwanted,

- unloved children will be born. Cer-
tainly some will be adopted, but by
and large most will never know the
safety and love of a real home. Is
that what we want?

Another tragedy that will come.
if abortions are outlawed, will be
the plight of women who become-
pregnant as the result of rape or in-
cest. What about them! If you were
or are a woman, would you want
to bear the child of your rapist?
Haven't you been hurt enough
already? Are we. as a society, to

say that these women must give
birth to these children? Surely not.
And what about women who will
die going through the process of
childbirth. I know that if my wife’s
health were in grave danger, and
that she might die giving birth to a
baby, we would both think serious-
ly about an abortion. There are no
easy answers to these serious
ethical dilemmas. To take away a
woman’s choice to have an abor-
tion will be creating more problems
than allowing abortions to continue.
Pro-lifers say that abortion ,is
murder. Pro-choicers recognize
that there is uncertainty as to where
life begins, and that if abortions are
outlawed there will be signiﬁcant
and terrible social consequences.
Before you decide which position
you should take, ask yourself: How
many unloved, unwanted children
will be born and how many women
will die of illegal abortions? By
making abortions illegal, would we

The Ritual Dissent/ J3

mes M. Crary

God, Guns And Rock ’n’ Roll

Power and the relationship of power
to the mind is a study almost inherent-
ly radical, because most conclusions a
person could reach about the state of

_ consciousness involved in power are

going to be negative and generally
away from popular tastes. The limits
of_the undertaking are minimal in
metaphysics, where conclusions have
their own validity, but great in public
forums, where the majesty of power
figures tends to override the con-
sciousness of the listeners; hence
biblical lies, Mick Jagger‘s excesses
and Weinberger’s instructions have
more inﬂuence than any operative con-

_science. This being the norm, in-

terested persons, for whom Power as
such is not considered a virtue, must

Sim_ply tS:peaking/ Tim van Gelder

find ways of stimulating autonomy in
the public, and thereby diminish the
potential for manipulation by key
authoritarian ﬁgures.

In Bedic mythology the god/ goddess
Shiva/Kali is considered the harbinger
of ruin, the destruction preceding ho-
ly renewal. It is said that this ﬁgure ap-
pears to “dance cities into dust.” As
an archetype, this religious ﬁgure ﬁnds
similar forms of expression in records
like KISS’ “Destroyer,” Bowie’s
“The Chant of the Ever—Circling
Skeleton Family” or the promise of
destruction in the New Testament or
new Pentagon budget reports. Indeed,
the temper of the times tends to be one
which welcomes the sense of imperil-
ment attendant in stockpiling lethal

nuclear arsenals. For some horrifying '

reason people seem to feed from and
thrill to the bellicose posturing and rav-
ing of military leaders and their big
bombs. It is generally conceded that
there is no virtue to doomsaying; yet
our culture thrives on the threat.
The metaphysics of military industry
are the metaphysics of rape. The no-
tion that you must demand what you
want because it isn‘t going to be given
to you is the founding father of taxa-
tion, extortion and rape. In a society
where government threatens the live-
lihood of its citizens by reckless
spending on superﬂuous bombs, the
charge looks ever more like rape with
intent to kill. Legitimate taxation, like
genuine love, is a process of

maintenance and marriage, with the
purpose being preservation of a good
life. Truly legitimate government
spending would be governed by a
voluntary tax allocation, where the
public individual chooses which
governmental departments his money
goes to.

The metaphysics of Heavy Metal are
the metaphysics - of rape. The
belligerent rantings of Motley Crue are
the howls of sexual frustration and
adolescent demands. The gross insen-
sitivity of such music reinforces insen-
sitivity in the personality of the listener.
In many Heavy Metal songs, the lyrics
are quite explicit in their libidinal
excesses.

And, of course, the metaphysics of
many religions are, sadly, the
metaphysics of rape. It generally is ac-
cepted that religious conversion is
something one should press on other
people, with or without their consent.
Why children are allowed to be forced
into church is beyond my understand-
ing. .
Until the individual mind is regarded
with the same integrity and decencies
with which we construct laws for the
protection of property, the demands for
louder music, bigger bombs and more
arcane rituals of religious relief will
grow, for when there is no inner peace
the noise around us must be loud in-
deed to drown out the noise from
within.

Libya Merely A Scapegoat In U.S. War Against Terrorism

Two things worry me about the cur-
rent U.S. outrage against terrorism and
the selection of Libya as a suitable
target for that outrage. First, it is very
unclear just what the United States
hopes to achieve through its sanctions
and threats of military intervention.
One week we apply economic
measures, and when they supposedly
fail, we threaten military action. But
what would have constituted the suc-
cess of those measures? A Libyan an-
nouncement, such as has been made by
at least some other Arab nations, that
it will no longer support terrorism?
Clearly, that alone is no worthy object
of American foreign policy; it is on a
level with President Reagan’s desire to
make Nicaragua say “uncle.” The real
aim is to cause Libya to actually give
up its support for international ter-
rorism. The trouble, however, is that
all the “evidence” for Libyan support,
to which administration ofﬁcials con-
stantly refer, either is classified or
otherwise unavailable in the media.

We, as mere citizens, just cannot know
the extent of Libyan support for ter-
rorism, and, critically, whether Libya
is or is not continuing that involvement
despite American pressure. We cannot
know, in short, just what the American
policies are directed against and
whether they are having any effect.
These are conditions under which we
should be very wary of the ﬂexing of
American military muscle.

Of course, Khadafy has openly
declared his support for Palestinian ter-
rorists, so I am not doubting that there
actually is at least some Libyan in-
volvement. But even so, it is not clear
that the United States can use this to
justify anything so extreme as a
military strike within Libya. The
Nicaraguan Contras commit terrorist
acts at least as terrible as anything per-
formed by the Palestinians, and the
Contras are openly supported by the
United States. Would that justify a
Nicaraguan)military retaliation within

the United States? Surely not — but
then, to be consistent,‘ we cannot ap-
prove an American strike within Libya.
There is clearly an implicit double stan-
dard at work here, a double standard
which the administration is taking full
advantage of in its self—righteous stance
on Palestinian terrorism. This sort of
double standard continually clouds our
thinking about terrorism" and what
counts as a terrorist act. I fully support
the aim of abolishing terrorism, but we
have to realize that this entails con-
straints on our own conduct as well ——
constraints such as not supporting anti-
Sandinista terrorists, and not hijacking
civilian jetliners even if a criminal we
want happens to be on board.

The second worrying feature about
the current focus on Libya is the
American attitude towards the Euro-
peans. Secretary of State Schultz sug-
gested not so long ago that one reason
the Europeans were not immediately
following thelAmerican lead vis-a—vis

Libya,‘ was that they had not looked
long and hard enough at the effects of
terrorism. This, it seems to me, is ar-
rogance and insensitivity. Most acts of
terrorism occur in Europe, and it is
outrageous to suggest that the Euro-
peans are not sufficiently aware of its
horror. Surely the recent massacres
received at least as much prime televi-
sion time in Europe, where they actual-
ly occurred, as they did in America.
If the Europeans did not immediately
join, en masse, in the American sanc-
tions, they must have reasons of their
own, and we should respect those
reasons". Obviously there is the fact that
their economic relations with Libya are
more important. But we also should
allow the possibility that they simply
do not believe that the isolation of
Libya is an effective way of ridding the
world of the evil of terrorism.

The increasingly familiar truth is that
the best method of reducing terrorism
is removing its underlying cause, which

in the current situation amounts to pro-
viding a solution to the problem of the
Palestinian homeland. As long as this
fundamental problem persists, Palesti-
nian extremists are likely to continue
their attacks; and it is to this problem
that our efforts and attention should be
devoted, not to the highly public
scapegoating of Libya. Various
features —— the fact that the extent of
Libyan involvement is veiled in
secrecy, the very public and highly
moralistic nature of the American posi-
tion, and the failure of the Europeans
to automatically’ join with us — all sug-
gest that what is really at stake is a
highly visible public relations exercise,
designed to enhance both U.S. power
in the Middle East and the administra-
tion’s moral prestige. That is, the ad-
ministration seems to be treating ter-
rorism and its Libyan support as a sort
of new Grenada, but with the advan-
tage that this time there is unlikely to
be anyone around to dispute the
legitimacy of their stance.

proved fake identification cards, the
task becomes that much harder.

"A lot of kids get their driver’s
licenses laminated or get a Polaroid
taken of it and change the date,” said
Bonesso. “And it is almost impossible‘
to tell whether the license is real or
not.”

Bonesso said that the problem of the
fixed identification cards could be
lessened if the individual were held
responsible for his actions instead of
the establishment.

“One night we carded everyone who
came into the place but when the LCB
came in they took away seven girls
because they couldn’t produce a
license," he said. “They had fake
I.D.s and didn’t show them to the of-
ficers —- and we were blamed because
they were in our place without any
identification. ‘

‘.‘If the responsibility were put on the
individual and not the bar, they would
think twice before coming into a bar
with a fake ID.”

Bonesso thinks that if a sign is posted
outside a bar stating that only persons
21 years of age or older are permitted

. inside, it will discourage underagers

from trying to go into bars.

-“I think they are old enough to take
the, responsibility on themselves,” he
said. "‘It’sjust like speeding — if you
go 80 mph down Forbes Avenue and
you get caught, it’s your fault. I don’t
think-all the blame should be put on the
bar.”

Nina Thompson, an assistant
manager at the Sanctuary, believes the
problem of fake identiﬁcation stems
from another source.

“I don’t think they should have done

away with the LCB card,” she said. L

“Kids get away with ﬁxing drivers
licenses, and in the past they wouldn’t
have been able to do that.”
‘Bill Siple, manager at C.J. Bamey’s,
also sees fake I.D.s as a big problem.
“It’s a big problem, and we do the

battle, and they’re always coming up
with new ways to get fake I.D.s, but
we are trying.”

Thompson sees the LCB as doing
their job. but not to the extent that they
should be doing.

“I think they’ve been harrassing the
Sanctuary and Peter’s Pub, and I'm not
sure why,” she said. “If they’re go-
ing to make raids they should do it to
every bar in the area. Just because this
is a college neighborhood, they tend to
concentrate on :us. There is just as
much underage drinking in bars in
Shadyside and downtown as there is
here, yet they’re not paying attention
to those areas.”

Bonesso doesn’t feel as though-
Peter’s Pub is being harrassed, but he
does feel that the LCB’s demands are
excessive. '

“As I said before, the LCB is ask-
ing us to do their policing and our
customers feel as though they're being
harrassediby us,” he said. “Then the
LCB comes in here like a hit squad and
blames us for not doing their job.

“I feel the LCB should be allowed
to raid bars, but the bars shouldn’t be
held responsible for the offenders in-
side — the individual underage should
be the one held responsible.”

Ford. however. disagrees.

“Obviously some places do make -the
effort to patrol their bars while others
don’t,” said Ford. “Last year we ap-
prehended 13,075 minors for underage
drinking in the state of Pennsylvania,
and a_lot of those kids were 13, 14 and
15 years old.

“The bars should take full respon-
sibility for the kids drinking there. The
people that run those places know the
laws and the rules, and these repeat of-
fenders should get out of the business
now.”

Bonesso said Peter’s Pub is not in the
business to sell alcohol to minors.

“We don’t intentionally go out and
get minors drunk,” he said; “We’re
here to serve our legitimate customers

and try in every way to justeserve

Pittsburgh—

By Adam Eisenstat

The Residents, those aggressively
avant-garde obscurantists with eyeball
heads, have always trod in the upper
stratosphere of cult mythology. After
13 years, 20-plus albums, singles and
EP and some dazzling innovative
videos, their satirization "of the
mythologizing process and its atten-
dant visual-symbol manipulation
(usually perpetrated by pop moguls)
has merged with their own thoroughly
unique status as symbol-laden, pop art
titans. ‘

Formed in 1972 along with their own
San Francisco-based company, Ralph
Records, The Residents subscribe to
the “theory of obscurity.” The theory
here is that by" remaining anonymous

(as they steadfastly have), they protect ’

themselves from medialaudience
manipulation and create original music
that is a product solely of their own
whimsical desires. They have sus-
tained this anonymity by wearing
disguises, rarely playing live (and even
then behind screens) and using a front
organization called the Cryptic Cor-
poration to act as their conduit with the
public world. It all sounds quite uncom-
promising and loaded with artistic in-
tegrity, but the overwhelmingly gim-
micky appeal of this obscurity must be
a fact not lost on these underground
mavericks. The concept of being
anonymous in show biz is no less than
brilliant. But the fact that they are
anonymous sometimes overshadows
The Residents’ funny and original
music.

The Residents, like any avant-garde
artists working in a context strongly
connected with pop culture (in their
case, rock ‘n’ roll), thoroughly disman-
tle recognizable pop entities (songs),
molding and distorting them into their
own style. In The Residents’ version of
guerilla warfare on pop, certain key
features of the attitude and instrumen-
tation of specific rock songs are exag-
gerated to an absurd degree. Their
version\ of “Satisfaction” (done two
years before Devo’s) grinds, plods and
stutters and stops with the sexual con-
gestion that Wyman and Richards
merely hinted at before. Their
“Jailhouse Rock” takes Elvis’s'ob|i-
quely cute, hothouse boogie stance to
undreamt-of dingy corners. One of
their best-known (popular?)albums,
Third Reich and Roll, contains over two
dozen '60s hits and includes a sleeve
picturing Dick Clark as Hitler. Cultural
fascism indeed. ‘

-Judging from their severely mutated

  MEET THE RESIDENTS

remakes, their unconventional, often
grating, use of synthesizers and
fabricated instruments plus their ex-
treme distance from their audience, it
seems that The Residents are con-
sciously employing Brechtian distan-
cing strategies for goals beyond mere
entertainment. German dramatist and
theorist Bertolt Brecht’s so-called
“alienation effect” is, in a nutshell, the
transformation of the familiar into the
strange, thereby compelling the au-
dience to analyze and recognize the
arbitrary, man-made nature of received
conventions. Bowie and Zappa are
mainstream rock’s foremost practi-
tioners of the alienation effect.
Unlike Zappa, The Residents are not
cold, overintellectualized propagan-
dists. They have a keen sense of
rock’s inherent tribalism and ritualism,

   

Vol. 8, No. 17 January 24, 1986

which manifests itself most strongly in
their distinctly‘ un-MTV-like videos. On
film, they cavort and romp to heavy
dirges and bombard the viewer with a
panoply of apparently free-floating
symbols like swastikas, Klan garb,
pentacles and of course Judeo-
Christian imagery. What it all amounts
to is anyone’s guess. Consistently
pier_Cing thrpughthedensenessand ar-
cane formal manipulation, though, is
their unique brand of childishness and

naivete, qualities The Residents claim 

to admire above all. y

MASTER HAROLD...and the boys
Pittsburgh Public Theater

By Susan Washburn

Racism, oppression and social in-
justices currently dominate the U.S.
media as attention is focused on the
harsh policies of apartheid. Pittsburgh
Public Theater, in sync with the public
conscience, is running its production
of Master Haro/d...and the boys— a
play set in Port Elizabeth, South Africa
in 1950.

Master Harold opens with two black
workers cleaning the floor and prepar-
ing the tables of St. George’s Park Tea
Room. They are simple, uneducated
men working for a meager salary;
however, instead of resenting their ex-
isténce, they remain confident that
someday things will change. They
believe that oppression will be

 

NUTS
City Theater

By Michael Blunt

Luckily, in this day and age, a per-
son cannot be committed to a mental
institution without having convinced a
psychiatrist that he is dangerous to
himself or to others. Even» if the doctor
is convinced he is “nuts,” he cannot
be held for any extended period of time
without a hearing. If he is found to be
a threat by the court, then he’s got
problems. What the City Theater in
Oakland has (at least until Feb. 16),_is
a professional cast with a warped

‘ script — in other words, a script that

is dangerous to itself and to others.

What we the audience have is a
visually pleasing production that
makes a night at the theater worth-
while. While an experienced
theatergoer might be displeased with
some of the staged antics, all in all;
Nuts is fast-paced and witty.

Helena Fluoti plays a woman on trial
for her sanity. Whichever way the case
turns out, she will be faced with emo-
tionalupheaval. Even though Ruoti
delivers in some places, we walk away
wondering where her motivation real-
/y lies. She moronically jeopardizes
herself at first and is totally sane later,
without any noticeable transition, when
the audience should be kept wonder-
ing. What Ruoti does do is make us
feel uncomfortable as hell, which is
very, very good. Although she delivers
fine technique “on cue,” she ulti-
mately lets the play down as a whole.
All is not lost, however, because the
rest of the cast makes up the
difference.

’ What has happened is that the direc-
tor, G.A. Elvgren, has unleashed his
able cast with such a melodramatic
thrust that the whole production is
turned into a veritable plea for the au-
dience’s pathos. Elvgren goes almost
as far as to ask the audience to la-ugh,
cry, feel pain and fetch a stick. The ac-
tors come through it, however, and are
very believable in their roles.

The law dictates that the alleged
“nutso” be allowed counsel, and Pitt’s
own James Bond (from the play Cloud
9) fits the bill. Bond gives a convincing
portrayal of an inexperienced young at-

torney making a fine display of his ef-. g

r

defeated and blacks will live among
white men as their equals.

William Jay (Sam) and Robert Jason
(Willie) have developed a rapport be-
tween the characters that works in
both the comedic and poignant bits.
This relationship is believable because
of the sincerity of William Jay’s actions
and his excellent sense of timing. His
love for his co-worker and for his young
Master Harold is expertly conveyed. it
is quite easy to feel his hurt and feel-
ings of betrayal when Harold turns
against him.

The relationship between Sam and
Harold resembles that of father and
son. Harold turns to Sam as a father
figure because his own father is a
crippled alcoholic. As a young boy
Harold spent endless hours with Sam,
not noticing the difference in color be-
tween them. However, as he matures
and prepares to take his place in soci-
ety, Harold struggles with his ideals of

Nuts: Chock

forts to get his client released from her
emotional jailors. Bond displays great
energy and youthful charisma_and
proves his skill as an actor. The avid
theatergoer would do well to watch for
him in upcoming productions.

‘x.

 

Ruoti) in NUTS

The prosecuting attorney, William
Cameron, treats the whole ordeal as
“another old case,” feeling sorry for
the defendant but prosecuting anyway
because “it has to be done.” Cameron
energetically yet effortlessly defends
the “people” as though he has been
doing it for years. All of this, along with
a proper amount of compassion make
Cameron a notable and important
member of the cast.

A case cannot stand without the

—<Jazz and modern dance: Two peas in a pod?>—

By David Zuchowski '

On Feb. .1, 1986, the Pittsburgh
Dance Council will kick off its spring
season at 8.p.m. with a live on-stage
concert at Heinz Hall featuring the
Murray Louis Dance Company and the
Dave Brubeck Quartet. What makes
the concert especially appealing is that
it unites two art forms indigenous to
America — jazz and modern dance.
The Brubeck/Louis gig is believed to
be the first real collaborative effort of
live musicians and live dancers on
stage at/the same time. According to
Tom Rees; manager of the Louis

dance troupe, the idea for putting both .

groups on stage. together has proved

to be such a huge marketing success V

“what a good white man should be”
and his love for Sam. He wants a world
where both can exist but realizes that
this dream is impossible.

This conflict is expertly written and
the script has incredible potential.
While watching this production,
however, I did not feel the scene had
its deserved impact. William Jay cap-
tures the emotion present in his
character as he tries to explain the
situation facing Harold. But at times,
it appeared as if Jay was directed to
stand in one spot while delivering the
speech, although he instinctively
wants to move. And giving the speech
to Harold’s back takes away from the
potential impact because Harold can-
not see the pain in Sam’s face.

In my opinion, the scene could have
been explosive" if Harold had to face
Sam. Facing Sam would have trig-
gered more emotion in the characters.
Instead, Harold sits in a chairtrembling

proper witnesses, all with their life
secrets bubbling inside them. More im-
portantly, a case cannot be built
without expert medical testimony. For
that we turn to Ben Tatar, a beguiling

  
     

of the symptoms of his patient. Self-
assured and very stuffy seems an apt
description of his character. Tatar had
this part down pat before it was
created, and in this production he
enlightens the role with verbal and
physical precision. ,
What of the judge played by Allan
Pinsker? Here we see an older man
who is quite personable and allows
enormous freedom in his courtroom.
Would you let a psychiatric patient

since their first concert in February
1984 at the City Center Theater in New
York, that he foresees many more
similar efforts between dancers and
well-known musicians in the future.
The program starts off with the
dancers performing to the taped music
of Brubeck in a set called “G|ances,”

choreographed by Murray back in ‘

-1976 to music arranged by Brubeck’s
son, Darius. Following “Glances” is a
solo number called “Frail Demons,"
danced and choreographed by Mr.
Louis himself, scored by Mick Loper.
Anna 'Kisselgo|f, New York Times
reviewer, said, “ ‘Frail Demons’ is a
solo seemingly danced through the
ozone of the soul, ‘a smog-laden, in-

ized the severity of the situation.
J. Mark Diamond, who portrayed

Harold, creates an endearing yet con-_
fused young man. He displays the =

problems of maturing and the conflict-
ing feelings toward his father with ac-
curacy. The fault in the production
though, is that the emotion in the last
scene is too weak for such a powerful
situation. I attribute this flaw to the
director, Larry Arrick.

Overall, this production of Master
Harold...and the boys is stirring. The
cast worked to create an understand-
ing of the conflicts that the young

master must learn to cope with in .
' manhood and conveys the hope of the

black workers that someday they will
live as equals of white men. When this

occurs, friendship such as the one be- '

tween Sam and Harold will proliferate
without the threat of intervening racial
predjudices.

awaiting trail for manslaughterjump up
on the bench with you? I doubt it
seriously. It is an example of the direc-

tor’s overstated influence.
Melodramatic flaws such as these are
literally and ostensibly used for their
shock value and are not very effective.

Although Nuts is quite predictable

and utterly commercial, there are two A V B
notable points of interest along the '_

way: namely, the performances of.

parents of the alleged “nuts.” We
witness Mogg as a mother who is so

that within 10 minutes she displays ’

anger, denial, fear, acceptance and
guilt — the five stages of dying. It suf-
fices to say that Mogg was a tough. act
to follow. Bravo to Ms. Mogg and her
fine gifts.

. Of course, the bailiff (Jack Price) and

the stenographer (Linda Smythe) carry

themselves nicely and also deserve to '
be included within the ranks of this -

distinguished cast.

Nuts by Tom Topor is now running

at City Theater in Oakland. Despite the 
author’s sophomoric and predictable 
script, the cast overcomes its foibles _

and offers a rich blend of emotion and
wit that undoubtedly has_ a little

Frank Zappa has always been an.‘

' A LONG TIME COMING (A

CHANGE IS GONNA COME)
Evelyn “Champagne” King

I I was in a_ deviate mood. I asked a
friend of mine to blindfold me and play
two different albums by two of popular

. music's most promising young rhythm

and blues starlets. I was hoping to
prove the difference between the
voices of Evelyn “Champagne” King
and Stephanie Mills. The results:
There is a difference, however slight.

King’s voice is the more mature one.
Though it reaches its height of feeling,
it’s also like a hybrid of a Gladys Knight
and a Gloria Gaynor. Unless she’s
weeping and wailing, her style
becomes unoriginal, and her best
‘vocal qualities begin to wear thin.

_ ‘Stephanie Mills, though, has the bet-

ter voice. |t’s candy-coated and pop-
oriented, a little-girl kind of shrill with
her delivery winding into the higher

' notes as if she's going triple-speed on

the ferriswheel.

Now I blindfold my friend. And I turn
off all the lights. We indulge in a few
rounds of vodka and cranberry juice,

brook. Probably the most dynamic of
the instrumentals, however, is “What’s
New In Baltimore?” which shifts from
a bright, quick-moving opening into a
high-powered, bluesy guitar solo.

Indictments of different lifestyles ap-
pear throughout, most notably in
“We’re Turning Again,” an attack on
the often thoughtless, drug-filled ’60s
youth culture, and “Y0 Cats,” a look
at a get-rich-quick musician with no
credibility.

If one wonders where Dead Ken-
nedys’ singer Jello Biafra picked up his
vocal style, one need only hear Zappa
crooning, They've got nothing to laugh
about including themselves on “We’ re
Turning Again.” “Yo Cats” surprising-
ly contains one of the album’s
mellowist musical accompaniments;
the band manages to sound as if
they’d just returned from playing a ses-
sion with Mel Torme.

The record’s centerpiece, however,
is the 12-minute long montage of ex-
cerpts from actual Senate hearings on
this “outrageous filth” we know as
rock music. “Porn Wars” jumbles
statements from the hearings,
speeding them up and slowing them
down, and adding Zappa-devised
vocal interruptions and music. The
track fades with pig-like snorting ac-
companying the various spoken
words. My only disappointment here is
that Zappa 'didn’t include more of his
own testimony; the section of the track
where Zappa answers Senator Paula
Hawkins’ question about the toys his

.children grew up playing with, with an

invitation to Come on over to the house
is hilarious. “Porn Wars” is intriguing,

I tell my friend to feel free to get up and
dance whenever he hears the music
beginning to tantalize his feet. We
begin with Evelyn King’s “Chemistry
of Love.” Neither of us feels the need
to dance. My roommate walks in and
wonders what the hell is going on. We
offer her a drink and she joins the
review.

have had by ignoring some of the
PMRC’s more ridiculous comments
and much of the event’s humor.

. Frank Zappa proves true. to his aim
on Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of
Prevention by offering totally new
music which displays, again, his
musical and creative genius. This
latest album represents no great land-

hungry, so I ask my friends another
favor. We’re still sitting in the dark,
they are still blindfolded (I have
become an expert at turning records
on the turntable in a pitch-black room).
I ask them to judge the -ballads and
rate them on a scale of emotional im-
pact. They like Stephanie Mills’ “Just

. b You,” but it’s clearly Evelyn King who

wins this category. Not that Stephanie
Mills can't be successful with a ballad,
its just that what she needs is a well-
written love song thatshowcases her
talent. ‘‘If I Let Myself-Go” is a big hit

for King, as is the title cut“ A Change

Is Gonna Come,” which must have
been pretty special since my friends
cried and danced.

Is there a lesson in all this? Yes. If
you wanna hear rhythm, get out on the
dance floor. If you wanna hear blues,

buy a Tina Turner album. One of the.

reasons why both Stephanie Mills’ self-
titled album and King’s A Long Time
Coming (A Change Is Gonna Come) are
disappointing is that they’re over-
produced. And why so many pro-
ducers? The most fortunate moments
for both singers are sometimes lost in
the hands of excessive production
technique: manic techno-pop strums
and overblown synthesizer thumps.
Another reaon to ignore these mild
efforts by both artistsis that Evelyn
“Champagne” King and Stephanie
Mills have consistently released one

album every year for the past seven or’

eight years. Maybe we can all get
together this time next year, have a
few drinks, turn out the lights and cry
and dance.

  

mark, nor shatters any preconceptions
the listener might have had of music's
limits and boundaries. But it’s unfair to
always expect so much from Zappa.
As evidenced here, even a relatively
average Frank Zappa album proves
engaging and far surpasses most new
music for performance quality and
originality.

The Hickoids, who pose as white

(they wear ten-gallon hats and have
horseshoe tattoos on their biceps),
play an obnoxious and puzzling blend
of hardcore and hillbilly music. The
lead singer,whose voice grates on one
like the sound of a tortured mule,
shouts about vittles, goats and
altruism. The lead guitarist ‘rapidly
pumps out neat, occasionally cornball
Country and Western riffs. And when
the whole band harmonizes — which
sadly, is not too often —— they sound
uncannily like the _Rolling Stones cir-
ca Exile on Main Street. Awful produc-
tion contributes to the confusion of this

it’s hard to tell if the Hickoids are be-
ing sarcastic about the whole coun-
try/punk thing, or if they really mean it
when they sing We ain’t no slick band

is.This chorus is from “Beautiful

the Spruce Goose takes the opportuni-
ty to really showcase the Steel City.
The city in turn demonstrated its pride
by packing the Fulton at this premiere,
which doubled as a benefit for Abraxas
and the Vocational Rehabilitation
Center. Abraxas members work with
juveniles troubled by such difficulties
as drug and alcohol abuse, emotional
disorders and physical/sexual abuse.
The Vocational Rehabilitation Center
helps thousands of disabled persons
find jobs through counseling, work
training and evaluation. The benefit
raised over $10,000.

FAMILY REUNION
By Ogden Nash
Little, Brown and Co.

By George Kresak€._

It is with great fondness that I recall
those days of long ago when l was but
a child, a mere lad of 10 years. On
Sunday evenings, the family gathered
expectantly together in the trim, little
front room of our hquse in the woods.
My brothers and sisters and I, silent in
reverential attendance, arranged
ourselves in comfortable little piles on
the floor and humbly denied ourselves
the impish delight we sugkled from
such happy endeavors as disembow-
eling the family dog or splattering each
other with globs of corrosive battery
acid. Father, sober for the first time in
a week, puffed contemplatively at his
pipe as he reclined on the sofa and
prepared to be ill.’ Next to him
snuggled Mother, looking deceptively
gentle and tender, the banshee that
possessed her and so often filled the
family with anguish then at full
respose. Near the hearth, Grandpa,
that fierce, grim-faced old man who
forgave little and reviled much, sat
stiffly in a hard-backed chair and
abruptly coughed a spiral of phlegm in-

  ., Ta king Off

Post-adjournment, Larry and Lynn in-
vite a fellow SPFC couple over for

drinks. in their stupor, the foursome’

proceeded to play “Texas one-card
showdown,” commonly termed strip
poker. Card after card, the Tynes free
their bodies, until Larry, completely
nude, decides to sing “Stranger in
Paradise,” tabletop, for his fellow
jaybirds. Unknowingly, their daughter
Jeannie returns that night and inter-
rupts his bemused solo. Then the film
ends abruptly as Jeannie brings her
runaway mate/boyfriend home for din-
ner, Larry returns to his nicotine addic-
tion, and once again sings “Strang-

; «MI 1' .

The Flight of the Spruce Goose
follows the form of a classic love story:
Two people meet, they fall in love after
surmounting several obstacles. But in
the end, fate forbids the film's vitality.
Essentially, a Pittsburgh coalminer
falls head-over-hills for a local model
who happens to be in search of suc-
cess and has little time for much else,
including this roughish Romeo. Dan

O’Shea dynamically stars as Adam, »

the conservative, determined
coalminer. In Flight of the Spruce
Goose he is determined to get his girl
at all costs.

Jennifer Runyan as Terri plays the
young Pittsburgh model whose
somewhat pushy mother (Karen Black)
has badgered her into believing that a
vibrant career should be her primary

goal. As such, little time remains for‘

the affections of this home-town boy.

Additionally, in light of the film’s
premiere, it is Dan O’Shea’s first
movie experience. A native New

' Yorker, he has spent most of his time

to his lap, prefatory to commencing the
evening’s solemn task.

And so Grandpa read to us from the
family’s volume of Ogden Nash’s col-
lected works. Grandpa’s voice became
surprisingly florid and lyrical for a man
of his demeanor as he opened with
“The Return,” a powerfully moving
verse bewailing the lossof innocence

on Broadway; however, he can cur-
rently be spotted in a commercial for
Miller beer. He’s the one in the sailor
suit. In the movie, though, he performs
well, evolving from a naive, rather timid
pursuer to the dramatic, determined
go-getter.

Runyan is also relatively new to the
movie scene, with credits including
Ghostbusters and two small parts in
Falcon and the Snowman and Up the
Creek. _

In other respects Flight of the Spruce
Goose brings many of Pittsburgh’s
strong visuals to the screen. Contain-
ing many gorgeous scenes of the city,
it includes a sparkling view from Mount
Washington, the PPG building, the
Point and even the old Oyster House
in Market Square. In case anyone has
forgotten what beauty lies in Pitts-
burgh, this film will revive his apprecia-
tion. According to producer Michael
Hausman, people who have seen the
film ‘can't believe it’s “really Pitts-
burgh.” Hausman’s other productions

nundrums from among those treating
of the strange and beautiful beasties
encountered on the plains and the
meadows, under the brooks and
oceans, and in the forests and-the
jungles of our most bountiful and good-
natured planet. These were of par-
ticular interest to the kiddies; the rid-

d_|es revealed through Nash’s clever A

. and cursing the spasm of creeping

cynicism. Father became maudlin as
the simple yet evocative pastoral im-
agery moved him to a tearful
divulgence of the disillusionmentof his
romantic ideals and his self-imposed
impotence.

When father was once again still,
Grandpa, registering disapproval in his
deep-knit brow, read doggedly on. He
recited a number of Nash’s little co-

turns of phrase made us squeal with
such unremitting delight that the
youngest of our clan wet herself and
became quite flatulent.

Unperturbed, Grandpa resumed his
inexorable plod through Nash’s beguil-
ing verse, while little Margie squirmed
uncomfortably and dodged the blows
Mother directed at her frail head. We
were gently herded through the foibles
of the family experience, grimacing

Another interesting aspect to watch
is when Adam “lets loose” and kid-
naps Terri in a daring daylight
escapade, highlighted .with Pittsburgh
musician and songwriter Norman Nar-
dini’s “Burnin’ Up.” Also this particular
scene shows off the directing ability of
Lech Majewski, aman who trained at
the State College of Film, Theater and
Television in Lodz, Poland._ A

Apparently many of those involved
in the execution of Flight of the Spruce
Goose found Pittsburgh an enjoyable
place to work. Michael Hausman,
when asked what he thought of work-
ing in Pittsburgh, exclaimed, ‘‘I want

to come back; I love it here.” The «

chances of Pittsburgh’s becoming a
major part of the movie industry are
looking better. .
Editor’s Note: Flight of the Spruce
Goose is currently fielding offers for
distribution.

 

gden Nash returns with his family reunion

and guffawing at Nash’s vivid
representation of the idiosyncracies of
parents in relation to their children and
vice versa. We listened all agog;
Nash’s sharp wit and clear insight im-
pressed us with the skill with which he
dissected the family unit where parents
vacillate between pride and anxiety,
children alternately enrage and
endear, and spouses pepper their love
and affection with grievances and
annoyances. .
When Grandpa had at least finished
his captivating recital, little Margie,
ever the dissenting intellectual, tried to
argue that Nash’s portrayal of the fami-
ly, in light of rampant divorce rates and
the general deterioration of the family
in modern times, was no longer valid.
She was quickly rebuffed by Mother
with an arching left hook to the jaw that
sent her sprawling. “Nash’s work,”
declared Grandpa, "‘far from being
sophisticated poetry, is verse for the
common man.” None could deny that
there were any more common than
ourselves. It fell upon us, then, to love
Ogden Nash and his charming verse.
A-nd we did  with all our hearts.

ers’’ for his adoring family and guest.

Though this film uses the ’60s edi-
ting style of intersplicing extraneous
footage within the narrative, the end
result is surprisingly "comical. Begin-
ning with Jeannie’s audition for a
musical, the entiretyof the film is ac--
cented with _short musical interludes
from the likes of Carly Simon and
many Joan Baez and Janis Joplin im-
personators. But the most dynamic of
these sequences is when Larry ex-
c.laims, “She’s out having fun. That’s
what we ought to do — go some place
and have fun, goddammit.” What
Larry and Lynn resolve to do is attend

a nightclub performance of the Ike and
Tina Turner Revue. With Tina and her
three lkettes “ponying” around the
stage, Tina blares “Goodbye-so long”
with a vocal ease and intensity still
prevalent in her current performances.

Following the completion of Taking
Off, Forman began to create four of
America’s most-awarded films: One
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Hair,
Ragtime, and Amadeus. It is thus
justifiable to alert audiences to
Carnegie lnstitute’s first screening of
the film in nearly 15 years. Forman’s
consistent analysis of social interaction

in combination with dynamic musical
scores undeniably situates him as a
conscientious and master director.
Taking Off may be considered a lesser
work in view of his latter attainments;
but in itself, Taking Off is the film that
oriented America to his unique style
and successfully raised Forman to
become one of America’s foremost
filmmakers.

Taking Off, in conjunction with the-
Section of Film and Video’s Milos For-
man series, will be screened at 8 p.m.
on Sat., Jan. 25 in Carnegie lnstitute’s

A Museum of Art Theater. »

ME IS MONEY!
.-  i ran" Lt

By G.B. Patterson

I hope all you female readers have
something to do this Sunday. it’s not
that you wouldn’t already have some-
thing to do, but just plan to do
whatever you were doing with your
girlfriends. You see, there will be no
men around on Sunday. They will all

be huddled around TV sets, engaging .

in one of the most important rights of

‘ American manhood — the Super Bowl.

What is this social phenomenon that
causes time to stand still for four or five
hours on the .last Sunday of every
January? I personally take part in this
ritual every year, but still I don’t know
why. Though I do know that there are
a few things in a man's life which take
precedence over all other things, the
Super Bowl being one of them. But still
— why? if you go out today and ask
any guy what he’s doing on Sunday,
he’ll look at you funny.'The question
is not “what” he’s going to do on Sun-
day, but rather “where” he’s going to
do it, how much beer will be supplied,
what kind of munchies will be pro-
vided, and who will win the prestigious

. title of “Super Bowl Champ.”

What’s the cause of all this hoopla?
Well, you’d think that we'd all be sick

of football, having watched it on Sun-'
day and Monday nights for the past
few months. But, why would anybody
start to watch pre-game shows at 10
a.m. when the game doesn’t start un-
til late in the afternoon? Why would
anybody guzzle brew for a couple
hours without making a trip to a
restroom for fear of missing the
decisive play? Why would people
watch ‘‘all those huge men run into
each other,” as my friend Debbie
asked? |’l| tell you why, mister 
because we’re men. Not only that —
we're American men. I know I sound
like a guy you’d meet at the tractor

pulls, but it’s the only rationale I can
find for participating in this annual
ritual. You know, I even feel a little red
around the neck when I watch the
Super Bowl. I guess that’s part of the
whole experience, letting the Rambo
in us all escape for a few hours.
Now let’s get away from the psycho-
logical reasons for not only enjoying,
but actually taking part in the most im-
portant game of the year. Just look at
the cast of characters we have taking
part in this game of gentlemen. First,
there’s the Bears. They've got Jim
McMahon, the coolest passer around.
He’s got a shotgun arm, reads well

among the downtrodden: I pity the man
who fucks with my brother, I pity the
man who don ’t help him out/Time to be
a brother. This band does not play or
sing straight hardcore very
remarkably, so they should just stopit.
They are also guilty of employing the
once-amusing but now tiresome hard-
core gimmick of using cover versions
of popular songs as filler. The theme
songs from both Bonanza and Hee-
Haw are included here for a cheap
laugh as is a speedy rendition of
“Burnin’ Love,” actually pretty good
due to some cool, twangy guitar leads.
“Lead a Horse to Water,” a weird, fun-
ny, country ballad about being respon-
sible for your own alcoholism, is
another bright spot amid the throw-
away songs and manic tributes to the
wild West.

“Corntamination,” like several other
songs on the album, is about the

.iHickoids themselves. Here, these

rootin’ tootin’ guys sing: Some folks
thinks we're cool, some folks think
we ‘re bumsx The Hickoids know the
seed is sown and someday it will grow/

’ People gonna-wanna shake our hands

everywhere we go. If they cut someof
the cowboy/farmer jokes and dropped
the hardcore cliches, these guys might
actually be left-with enough substance
to put out a good second album and
justify their rowdy conceit. Until then,
it’s probably best to see them live
where their slapdash songwriting,
hyperactivity and tendency to perform
in nothing but their underwear and
cowboy boots might be more gratify-
ing than this record. '

On the other side, there are a bunch I

watch the Super Bowl, and that many
girls do watch the Super Bowl. May the
former burn in hell, and may the latter
be congratulated.

By Adam Eisenstat

Last year saw rock infested with the
stink of altruism, manifested by
brigades of coke-stoked, glitter-
bedazzled stars and starlets flaunting
their talents and newfound do-gooder
status in grandiose charitable spec-
tacles for the likes of bloated-belly
Ethiopians, local seed-sowers and the
anti-apartheid cause. I think this is a
noxious trend which produces corre-
spondingly noxious music (with the ex-
ception of the Sun City tune).

Anyone, especially masses of
nouveau‘ riche rock stars claiming
totally unselfish motivations for their
do-goodedness, makes me suspicious.
Art, of which pop/rock is a loose
representative, is most effective when
it remains true to its origins as genuine
self-expression. When, I see pop
nobodies like Bob Geldof and Stevie
Wonder receiving ordinarily costly
press exposure as a direct result of
their involvement in some safe,
popular cause, I wonder if altruism is
really the compelling force here. In
showbiz, exposure is like oxygen is to
a normal person: it’s absolutely
necessary for survival. Otherwise,
people will ask, “Whatever became of

7..

Besides the dishonesty at the root of
pop altruism, it is also invariably
marked by a high degree of reduc-
tionism and naivete. It seems that in
their frenzied efforts to be (seen) at the
front of politically correct causes and
scale new heights of se|f-congratula-
tion, these megastars have diverted at-
tention from the complexities of such
involved and difficult situations as the
Ethiopian famine. They also create
within themselves and others the delu-
sion that any problem, regardless of its
scale, can be solved just by throwing
money and concerned, stellar per-
sonalities at it. Not always so, I fear.

While dredging the depths of
popular consciousness, it seems only
fitting to mention Bruce Springsteen,
who, along with Rod Stewart, ranks as

 

   

rock’s most staggering example of
how great talent can be perverted by
total, unequivocal mass adulation.

I used to really love this guy’s work.
His first four albums, along with some
stuff from The River and Nebraska, are
high points in the last two decades of
rock. What happened? For reasons
probably destined to remain unknown
to small, stained minds like my own,
he embraced a formula he had only
touched on before: totally sincere
representative of the working class,

totally committed to uplifting the

masses with solid rock ‘n’ roll. Sounds
simple and commendable, right? A bit
too much of both. A man who once
wrote songs that were subtle and
poetic word collages on top of ir-
resistibly gutsy playing has stooped to
simplistic (that word again) and redun-

dant social realist cartoons to the point"

where the man himself is a cartoon, an
utterly unself-reflexive pop icon whose
artistry and complexity have been
swallowed by the masses’ appetite for
easily digestible and familiar homilies
of home, hearth and hungry heart.
Bruce has become a-K-tel populist,
cashing in on over a decade of hard

work and image building. His next
record will indicate whether he accepts
and affirms the farce or can create
some distance from the masses who
make millionaire myths. out of_ mere
mortal men.

I’m convinced that pop music, true
pop music that gets played to millions,
has been usurped by the relentless
pursuit by Hollywood moguls for sure-
fire images, which translates into
caricatures of whatever main attribute
a star has. For example, Madonna is
more a cultural artifact than a pop star.
In her exaggerated (and ultimately

numbing) version of female sexuality, '

certain male masturbatory scenarios
are ritually enacted daily. Of course
none of this has any bearing on the
throbbing, utterly convincing sexuali-
ty of someone like Howlin’ Wolf, whose
vocal presence had eons of vaginal
oomph long before Ms. Penn made
The Enquirer for the first time. Of
course none of this really means much
of anything for the struggling
business/engineering student floun-
dering through four years of acute
commodities poisoning. It's all so very
much obliviousness masquerading as

Chubs, who exploit them and deny
them their culture. Tunes explores the

underground music and the Chubs’

a titanic struggle; when last performed
on stage in the early '80s on the West
Coast, itincluded elaborate props and
theatrics and of course the ever-

obscure Residents playing their in-
imitable dirges and ditties.

The Residents haven’t played live
very much and never in Pittsburgh; so
whatever transpires Wednesday night
at Graffiti will be somewhat new and
different for most people in atten-

/dance. It may sound like they intend
to bludgeon everyone with some
vaguely metaphorical musical concept,
but the best way to take these sonic
surrealists is probably just to sit back
and enjoy the weirdness.

tranquility, we boy toys of the print
medium who slay the pop icons framed
and foamed on in front of us so as to
assuage our guilt at following the lure
of ever-comforting superficiality and
plastic sensuality. But let me digress 
I saw an old man on a park bench
‘ and he was humming the theme from
The Brady Bunch. “Old man," I said,
“how be it such pop sludge had in-
filtrated your mind?”

“Well,” he drooled, ‘‘I once listened
only to Vivaldi and Chopin and read
only classics like Faust and Oliver
Twist, but cathode fumes and moppets
in ribbons poisoned me somehow. I
couldn’t walk into a drug store without
being bludgeoned by jailbait god-
desses staring at me from the covers
of Seventeen and Young Miss. When
I got a Dio haircut, well, that sealed it.

- It was, like, inside out.’_’

When I walk by a magazine rack
these days, I can?t help the feeling of

- moppet-hardbody-sex-queen-rock-

goddess anomie. Anomie, by the way,
is the feeling one gets in a world in
which he is told he should have this,
that and that, but it’s either inaccessi-
ble or non-existent for people of his ilk.
I truly will die a failure if I don’t become
a rock star. Deal me in on that
decadence doll; draw me a blood
doris; dish out some dole queue dar-
ling and make him a glam Johnny Rot-
ten; feed the fire of that ice blue blood
blonde, tell her a story; tell her to
remember it and put it in a safe place,
like with her Barbi Benton records.

If I may cut a swath through this

mass cultural wet dream, any one out
there with a mild sense of musical
adventure or maybe even overwhelm-
ing avant-garde pretensions should
catch guitar virtuoso-madman-
experimenteur Eugene Chadbourne at
the Electric Banana tonight. He’s tru-
ly one to expand one’s conception of
what constitutes music. These kind of
performers are few and far between in
the Steel Pity.

 Sports

Smith takes it to BC again  

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

It was a quiet gesture. One that went
unnoticed by most of the sellout crowd
in Fitzgerald Field House Wednesday
night. But it was pridefully elegant and
told the story of the night. After a first-
half dunk, the normally stoic Charles
Smith turned upcourt and fired his fist
in the air. It was a celebration, but .it
said so much.

It said that tonight the Pitt Panthers
were going to have a little more; that
on this night, they simply would not
allow themselves to lose.

And so it was that when the clock

. was empty the Panthers had a 64-62

win over Boston College. It may be a
little soon yet to talk of must games for

. Pitt, but this was nothing less than very

/‘+1
"\ 4.’

 

  

important for the Panthers if they hope
to have any chance at all of finishing
among the upper echelon of the Big
East.

“Balance, as much as anything,
helped us win the basketball game,"
Panther coach Roy Chipman noted
after the game. “I was pleased with the
way we‘ hung in there. That was a
tribute to this team.” , .

Pitt trailed most of the game, but
hang on it did, never letting the score
get beyond six points in the Eagles’
favor. Aside from tenacity, Chipman
credited the win to outstanding defen-
sive play by his troops and the clutch
shooting of Darryl Shepherd.

“We played excellent defensively,”
Chipman said, “And Darryl Shepherd
was superb. They played a box-and-
one in the second half which bothered
Charles Smith, but anytime you use a
gimmick defense like that there will be
holes, and Shepherd was able to step
in and fill the seam.

Shepherd scored eight of his 18
points in the ﬁnal 4: 10 of the game. In- _
cluded in that stretch were critical
jumpers, which put the Panthers up for
good, 56-54, and later gave Pitt a six-
point bulge at 60-54 with less than two
minutes to play. It was also Shepherd
on the receiving end of a crucial in-
bounds pass from Curtis Aiken with 10
seconds remaining. Aiken sailed the
ball down court over the arms of
Boston College defenders and it was
Shepherd who made a leaping grab to
pull the pass in and keep possesion for
Pitt. '

“Everyone had confidence in me and
Joey [David] was getting me the ball

 Shepherd said, leaving the
sentence .to be completed by anyone‘
who saw his gem ofa game. “Against
teams like Boston College, they’re a
scrappy team, they move from side to
side a lot and that gives players like me
a cha-nce to do something."

An important aspect of the Pitt win
was shooting from the ﬂoor. Or lack
of it in the second half for the Eagles.
In the first half Boston College shot a
slick 57.7 percent, taking most of their
shots from outside 10 feet. But in the
ﬁnal 20 minutes BC went cold, hitting
only 40 percent from the floor. Part of

‘the reason for thatwas Pitt’s defensive

adjustments at the half, and part was
due to the fact that the Eagles’ Roger
McCready,failed to connect on most of
his shots.

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

Pitt forward Charles Smith continued his feast on
Boston College with 20 points’ and 10 rebounds
against the Eagles on Wednesday night.

McCready is the catalyst for Boston
College and one of the outstanding
players in the league, but he managed
only 4-11 from the field, and went a

dismal 2-7 in the second half alone. It.

was that kind of night for the Eagles.

And it was the kind of night the Pan-
thers have been coming out on the short
end of in league games this season.

“That’s the kind of game we ex-
pected,” Tico Cooper said after the
game. “It was good that we won a
game like this.” Cooper played six
minutes and did not score, but despite
the lack of offensive prowess from the
junior transfer, he is gradually becom-
ing more and more an integral part of
the Pitt game plan.

“It takes a burden off Smith,”
Demetreus Gore said. of having Cooper
in the lineup. With Cooper in, a
defense has to contend with one more
large body underneath, freeing Smith
to get open for better shots.

It helped on Wednesday especially,
with Smith again atop the scoring

‘leaders with 20 points for the evening.

One problem the Panthers ran into

all night was moving the ball around
against Boston College’s press.
“We’re_rotating so many guys that
sometimes it hard to pick things up
when you come into ‘the game,”
Cooper said of the Panther difﬁculties.
-Indeed no fewer than seven Pitt players
saw at least 23 minutes of action, com-
pared to four for Boston College.

One of,the pleasant surprises of the
night for Pitt was the availability of
Joey David. The guard was injured in
the Duquesne game Monday and suf-
fered a hip pointer. David was not ex-
pected to be ready until at least this
weekend.

“Joey was 80-85 percent of playing
capacity,” Chipman remarked. “And
he said ‘If you need me I can play.’
And we needed him, especially on
defense.”

The win moves the Panthers to 4-3
in the Big East and 13-5 overall. For
Boston College, their record drops to
11-6 overall and 2-4 in Big East play.

Pitt continues its home stand this
Saturday against. St. John’s in a na-
tionally televised contest beginning at
3 p.m. The game is sold out.

Home fans asked
to tone it down

Letter To The Students:

The atmosphere at Fitzgerald Field House was fantastic
Wednesday night, and the exuberant crowd certainly con-
tributed to Pitt’s heart-stopping two-point victory over Boston
College. . .

Our students were especially supportive and demonstrated
tremendous spirit and enthusiasm and, most of the time, good
sportsmanship. That’s as it should be, and it’s one of the reasons
KDKA’s John Steigerwald says the Pitt field house has the best
atmosphere of any sports facility in Pittsburgh. ‘

But we can get better, beginning tomorrow with St. John’s
in a 3 p.m. tipoff that will be nationally televised by CBS. It’s
an, opportunity to show ‘off Pitt at its absolute best.

It’s become a tradition at Pitt basketball games to respond
to the Panthers’ first field goal by tossing blue and gold
streamers onto the playing floor. That’s fine, and it lets the
visiting team know it is playing on the road and it’s going to
be a difficult game. '

But the throwing of objects onto the floor must stop. Any fur-
ther displays of that nature can result in a penalty to the home
team for delay of game.

Worse yet, the other night one of our students tossed a coin

. — a darned dime - onto the floor to protest a controversial

call by one of the officials. It didn’t strike the official, however.
It just landed on the floor, hardly visible. ‘

Charles Smith found it, the hard way. He stepped on it, slip-
ped, and wrenched an already troublesome knee. That’s why
he had to leave the game and go to the locker room for treat-
ment in the second half. He was able to return to play, but it
gave us all a big scare. C

It could have shelved him for the entire game. How about
the entire season? How about a career-ending injury? Just
because some student showed contempt for an official by ﬂing-
ing a coin onto the floor.

Let’s confine ourselves to throwing -streamers onto the floor
— rolls of toilet paper aren’t appropriate, either —- to the first
field goal of the game. Then let’s showour spirit with good old-
fashioned cheering. .

Tomorrow, the Department of Athletics will be passing out
blue and gold shakers to all fans at the game. Shake those
shakers and show off the school colors to a national audience,
and let’s knock off St. John’s. Do not throw the shakers onto

the court at any time.

Shake those shakers. Shake up St. John’s. Let’s clean up our
act and be the best kind of fans we can be. Let’s go Pitt!

Pitt student section

getting out

For the past four days I have
been trying to sort out my feelings
about being a part of the student
section during Monday’s Duquesne
game at Fitzgerald Field House.
Finally, I can put it into words.
That game was the first time in my
life that I havebeen embarrassed
to be a Pitt student.

The crowd that night -was
disgusting.

Bob Travers

Their behavior ranks right up
there with the kid who beats a
chained dog while standing just
beyond the reach of the chain. For
the benefit of those of you who
were lucky enough not to have
been at the game, some students
thought it would be funny to yell
“Rapist!” every time Duquesne
player Emmett Sellers touched the
ball. Sellers, you remember, was

ofhand 

one of the Dukes charged with the
rape of a Wilma Boyd student in a7
Duquesne dormitory. Sellers and
the others were cleared of all rape
charges in a criminal court case last
year. But some people thought it
would be clever to call Sellers
names. .
Oh you nutty, crazy, college
kids! '1 ..
I realize that not all of the
students in the Field House were '
involved, but enough were to be .
heard easily on Fifth Ave. Not.
everybody was involved, but the
ones who were yelling were
wrong. Maybe it bothers me so
much because I don’t understand.
the purpose of screaming at
Sellers. If they were trying to be
funny they missed by a mile. '
As everybody knows, the No. 1
rule of good comedy is to always"
have the element of surprise. Call-
ing Emmett Sellers a rapist was,
unfortunately, expected. Those of

Wrestlers keep streak alive

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

CANTON, Ohio —- The Pitt wrest-
ling team has pawed another victory
from the clutches of defeat. The Pan-
thers have stretched their unbeaten
record to 5-0-1 on the season, but it
was hardly an easy win.

Wrestling away from the friendly
confines of Trees Hall turned out to be
a tough task, in spite of winning seven
of the 10 matches. Pitt tenaciously
escaped the grasp of the Kent State
Golden Flash, scoring a 22-15 victory.

With Pitt holding tightly to a slim
19-15 lead, junior Curtis Conner found
himself with the match’s outcome
resting on his shoulders. If that wasn’t
enough added weight to carry through
the bout, Conner was giving up 51 lbs.

to Kent’s Paul Litzinger at

heavyweight.
With their match tied 9-9 at the end
of the second period, Conner let it all

out to put the Panthers’ fifth victory‘

away for good in the third. Conner
scored two escapes and a takedown.
along with a riding time point, to win
the match 14-11.

“I think Conner deserved a lot of
credit,” said assistant coach Stan
Mousetis. “He hung in there tough,
even though he was outweighed con-
siderably.”

“All of the coaches are very proud
of him,” added Coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer, “as was the entire team.”

For the hero, Conner was just re-
lieved to have the match finished. “I
was relieved about the match. I knew
everything was riding on my match,
and I felt very good about it for me and
the team.”

Pitt got off to a rough start. losing
the first two matches. In the second
match, senior John Hnatli, wrestling at
126 lbs., was in the lineup despite his
fighting the flu. It did show, however,
as Don Homing scored a technical fall
and Pitt was quickly behind 9-0.

The Panthers fired right back. win-
ning six straight decisions, including a
four—point team win by senior Joe
Bond. After Brent Coldiron was dis-
qualified for stalling, that set the stage
for Conner and the icing on Pitt’s vic-
tory cake.

‘continued from page I
you who did the yelling, you saw
the obvious joke and took it. The
worst part of it was that you actual-
ly thought you were beingfunny.

You weren’t even close. The ob-
vious joke is never funny. No,
rather than being humorous, you
were being stupid and showed
everybody how unfunny you real-
ly are. I know most of you consider
yourselves to be pretty amusing
fellows, but sorry_kids, you blew
it on Monday. The only thing you
did was make total fools of
yourselves. »

But maybe you weren’t trying to
be funny. Maybe some of you were
just doing it out of meanness or
pent-up frustrations over your be-
ing in the stands while Sellers is on

the court Is your life really that

miserable that you have ‘to take it
all out on such an easy target as
Sellers? Did you get some kind of
perverse pleasure out of hitting out
athim like that? Remember the
jerk in your class in sixth grade
who used to bully the first graders
while the teachers weren’t around?
Ring any bells? It should. How
many of you would call Sellers a
rapist to his face? Ah,- but there is
safety in numbers, isn’t there?

_ It’s anonymity that protects you
when you’re in a crowd. And it is

‘ that facelessness which will protect

the idiot who threw the dime that
Charles Smith slipped on in
Wednesday’s Boston College
game. Smith was lucky, he came
out of it with a minor knee injury,
but a little twisting either way and

over —— because some total loser
thought he was tough and tossed a
dime onto a basketball court. I
wonder if it "would have bothered
him had Smith been hurt serious-
1y. I doubt it.

It’s one thing to yell at opposing
players and coaches -— that is a
normal, expected part of playing in
the enemy’s gym — but lately, Pitt
fans have been coming dangerously
close to crossing the line to com-

K plete boorishness and tastelessness.

It is possible that by bringing at-
tention to these fans in this article
that it will only encourage them.
But I’ll take the risk. It is more im-
portant that they understand they
were being jerks. And what really
hurts is they weren’t even being

all.

Bears’ Ditkawas perfectfor Pit

By Jim O’Brien
Special To The Pitt News

Editor’s note: Jim O’Brien is a
former Sports Editor of The Pitt
News. He currently holds the position
of Assistant Athletic Director for
Public Relations/Sports Information
Director here at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Mike Ditka has always personiﬁed
Pitt football at its best.

Ditka and Pitt just go together

somehow, like the mythical Joe

Magarac and Steelworkers in
southwestern Pennsylvania. They are
throwbacks to another era, when
smoke was rising from the mills in
Ditka’s hometown of Aliquippa and
everybody took it for granted.

Don’t get me wrong. Tony Dorsett,
Hugh Green, Danny Marino and Bill
Fralic were terriﬁc football players in
their Pitt days, as well as their pro
days, but Ditka has been doing it
longer, that’s all.

It’s been a quarter century, in fact,
since Ditka was a senior at this school.
He was an All-America end during that
1960 season, more feared for the
ferocity of his defensive play than his
pass-catching and blocking abilities
during the days when players went both
ways. - «

Now he is the NFL Coach of the
Year, the winningest coach in-the NFL
with a 15-1 regular season record as
head coach of the Chicago Bears, has
two playoff victories and the favorite’s
role against the New England Patriots
on the eve of the Super Bowl to decide
the NFL championship.

An image of Ditka from that 1960
season still remains in the mind. It’s
seeing Ditka on the Fifth Ave. porch
of the Student Union, wearing his crew
cut hair and his dark blue varsity jacket
with the gold “P” on his breast, school
books under his arm, looking every bit

I the Big Man on Campus which he was,

indeed, in his senior season;

That was the year — my freshman
year — that the Pirates defeated the
mighty New York Yankees in seven
games of the World Series — winning
the ﬁnal game in the ﬁnal inning on Bil-
ly Mazeroski’s magnificent home run
over the left field scoreboard — just
across the street from the Student
Union at old Forbes Field.

It was a difficult year for the Pitt
football team. It was a ﬁne team, but
the schedule was a murderous one. The
Panthers posted an odd 4-3-3 record.
They defeated Miami (17-6). West
Virginia (42-0), Syracuse (10-0) and
Notre Dame (20-13). They tied

. Michigan, TCU and Army, all by 7-7

scores. They lost to UCLA (8-7),
Oklahoma (15-14) and Penn State
(14-3). ' ~

Pitt’s assistant athletic director Walt
Cummins was a coach back then, an
assistant to John Michelosen, and he
remembers Ditka well. “He was scrap-
py, always competitive, always ready
to go all out,” said Cummins. “He
liked to practice hard, and complained

I if we weren’t hitting hard enough. He

always came to play.”

Ernie Hefferle handled the ends for
Michelosen. Hefferle, who retired two
years ago after serving as the pro per-
sonnel director on the NFL’s New
Orlean Saints, said of Ditka: “He was
the damndest player I ever came
across; you get one like him in a
lifetime, if you’re lucky.

“He used to forearm our own guys
in practice. He used to complain that
our practices weren’t tough enough. He
wanted more hitting. All he wanted to
do was hit, hit, hit.”

Said Bob Timmons, who coached
Ditka in football as well as basketball
at Pitt: “He’ll hit the ﬁrst guy he sees."
That was in both sports.

Ditka lettered for three years in foot-

ball, and two years in basketball and .

baseball for the Panthers. He’ was an
outﬁelder in baseball and an enforcer

in basketball, saving his best board-

work for the annual grudge games with
West Virginia. He was also the in-
tramural wrestling champion at Pitt.
Rex Perry, who coached the varsity
wrestling team and the U.S. Olympic
team during his days at Pitt, once said
Ditka could have been an NCAA
wrestling champion.

He was named ﬁrst team All-
America as a football player in 1960,
and was joined by the elite likes of Joe
Bellino of Navy, Ernie Davis of
Syracuse, Bob Ferguson of Ohio State,
E.J. Holub of Texas Tech, Danny
Larose of Missouri and Bob Lilly of
Texas Christian.

He was also named the winner of the.

Charles C. Hartwig Award as the
senior who did the most to promote the
cause of athletics at Pitt. ’
Ditka was the No. 1 draft choice of
the Chicago Bears‘. He came back to
Pittsburghduring the 1963 season, and
starred for the Bears in a 17-17 tie with
the Steelers. The Steelers were coached
by Buddy Parker that year, and
quarterbacked by Bobby Layne. They
were good, ﬁnishing with a 7-4-3

A young Mike Ditka
record and losing out on a playoff berth
in the ﬁnal game of the season. But the
Bears were better, and won the NFL
title that year.

Ditka made a run and catch that day
that I will never forget. I had an
unusual view of it, from the auxiliary

 

press box atop the right ﬁeld stands,

so I saw it from nearly directly
overhead. Ditka bounced off about a
half dozen Steelers on a fantastic run
of 40 or some yards, but ran about
twice that distance as he dodged one
tackler after another, stiff-anning this
one, breaking a tackle against the next
guy. It was unreal.

Ditka still prides himself on being a
Bears player, as well as an all-pro
caliber tight end with the Philadelphia
Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys during

‘ his 12 years of NFL play. But he also

cherishes his roots in Western Penn-
sylvania, and especially his Pitt
association.

“Looking back to my college
career,” Ditka once declared while
participating in a Pitt golﬁng outing at

the Pittsburgh Field Club that raised

$50,000 for the local Leukemia Socie-
ty, “Pitt means to me my whole life
— what I am now. As a kid growing
up, I wanted to go to Notre Dame. But
they didn’t get interested in me till late
in the summer after my senior year at
Aliquippa.

“When they ﬁnally invited me to
their campus, I had to turn down an in-
vitation to meet my boyhood idol, Stan
Musial. It came down to choosing be-
tween Pitt and Penn State or, really, the
recruiting coaches, Jack Wiley and Joe
Paterno. I loved them both. I 1

“At the last minute, I decided I
wanted to be a dentist, so I went to Pitt.
I owe Pitt so much. They played the
ﬁnest schedule, and they gave me a

publicity guy on my side in Beano ,
Cook, and he helped me become an

All-America.

_ “Johnny Michelosen may never go
down as one of the greatest coaches of
all time, but he had a lot of character.
He taught you how to play basic fun-
damental football. We tried to double-
team everyone on the ﬁeld, but, of
course, you couldn’t do that.

“I never thought .I was a good
athlete. I‘ thought I was determined.
That’s what I’m looking for with the
Bears — people with the right at-
titude.”

It appears he has found them. Ditka
deserves to coach such a team.

As I see it  
One more forgotten hero — Jack Johnson

It amazes me how many people there

' are who have never heard of Jack

Johnson. It also saddens me that many
people do not know about him, for Jack
Johnson was a true hero in every sense
of the word. He was the first black
heavyweight champion in boxing

' history, and his actions while in the

spotlight were to 

Well, here is his story.

Jack was born in Galveston, Texas,
in 1878, just 15 years after the Eman-
cipation Proclamation.

After quitting school in the ﬁfth
grade, Jack held many jobs. But it was
his job as a janitor at a gym that in-
troduced him to boxing. When the gym
closed each evening, Jack would stay
behind and work out on the heavy bag.
He practiced this new—found skill by
walking down the streets of his black
community, with two pairs of boxing
gloves, challenging people to informal
matches. Word spread of his prowess,
and Jack was hired as a sparring part-
ner for some area fighters.

At age 17, Jack got his big break. In
winning a boxing battle royal in Spring-
field, Il1., he highly impressed pro-
moter Johnnie Connors, who began to
arrange ﬁghts for Johnson.

Johnson fought so often over the next
10 years that he claimed that there was
no complete record of ' all his ring
battles.

Johnson beat almost every contender
around and still was denied a shot at
Tommy Burns’ title because it was con-
sidered in poor taste for a champion to
face a black man. He chased Burns all
over Europe, and Burns refused even

I to meet with Johnson!

Finally at age 30, Johnson was

granted a shot, but only if Burns‘
manager acted as referee, and Johnson
received $5,000, as compared to
Burns’ $30,000. for the fight.

Nonetheless, on Dec. 26, 1908, in
Rushcutter‘s Bay Arena in Sydney,
Australia, history was made. Johnson
won the fight via a 15th-round TKO.

A few weeks before the ﬁght, Burns
initiated a confrontation with Johnson.
Burns began to become obscene with
Johnson and use profanity despite the
presence of a seven-year—old girl.
Johnson became furious and promised
Burns: “I’ll remember this when I get
you into the ring.” When Johnson did
get him the ring, he drew out the end
of the fight by battering Burns
senseless, time and time again, only to
let him recover. before he would throt-
tle him again.

Many well—respected newspapers
disgraced themselves by running
stories that called the Johnson victory

‘a tragedy, and the search was on for

a “white hope." But Johnson toyed
with all of these men and no one could
even put up a good fight against him.

"He was unbeatable — and was hated

for it.

Blacks were expected to act inferior
to whites and Johnson made headlines
by refusing. He was proud of his
achievements. He walked with his head
held high and he usually could be seen
sporting a big cigar and even bigger
smile.

He became one of the wealthiest
black men in America and ﬂaunted it
openly by always wearing the most
stylish clothes and dazzling diamonds.
He opened a nightclub, The Cafe de
Champion, which ﬂourished, making

him a totally independent black man.
a rarity.

The white public had wanted former
undefeated champ James Jeffries to
come out of retirement for a long time.
He finally consented and a match with
Johnson was set for July 4, 1910.

Johnson won every round of the
15—round TKO. The ﬁght, which was
hyped by many newspapers as a battle
for racial supremacy, was suddenly
referred to as meaningless by those
same newspapers.’

Riots broke out everywhere, most in-
volving whites extracting revenge on
the blacks. Amazingly, there were only
19 deaths among literally thousands of
injuries.

Teddy Roosevelt called for the’aboli-
tion of boxing and ﬁlms of the fight
were suppressed because of the threat
of further violence. The fight was
viewed by the black community as a
second emancipation.

Early heartaches with black women
had caused Johnson to swear off them
forever. Aside from marrying three
blondes, he often traveled to his fights
with white women. Belle Schreiber was
the woman accompanying Johnson in
his travels around the time that he
fought middleweight champ Stanley
Ketchel.

Ketchel was the hardest—hitting mid-
dleweight ever, but he was just too
small for the masterful Johnson.
Johnson had been carrying Ketchel (to
give the fans their money’s worth)
when Ketchel caught him off-balance
and dropped the surprised champion.
Deciding that it was time to quit playing
games, Johnson rose from the canvas
and KO’ed Ketchel with one punch.

It was about this time that Johnson
was arrested forviolating the Mann
Act, a ridiculous law regarding men
and women traveling together. Many
opposed it, and Johnson had the guts
to stand up to it. However, he was
convicted.

An appeal was scheduled, but his
mother did not trust the authorities
because of the unfair trial that Johnson
had received. She told him that she
-would rather he ﬂee from the country,
never to return, than to trust “the
law.” He objected, but she insisted. He
sailed to France. ‘

Johnson surprisingly found many

-friends abroad, although he was never

at a loss for enemies.

Johnson toured Europe extensively,
visiting virtually every country. He met
with, and was well liked by leaders of
industry, science, politics, literature
and art. He was quite popular with the
upper echelon because of his oft-
overlooked intelligence. He was a self-
taught man, in the manner of Lincoln.
He was very well-read, and did this
reading in three languages. He was
conversant with all the works of
Shakespeare and was known to quote
the classics in everyday conversation.
He especially admired Alexander
Dumas and Victor Hugo.

He also was an avid fan of classical
music and a fair bass viol player. He
played many theater engagements
where he would act, box exhibitions or
discover yet another talent within his
vast arsenal.

He made a few title defenses and had
become happy with his new life, but
tragedy struck.

His mother had grown ill and

Johnson’s longtime friend and pro- .

moter Jack Curley told the champion
that the authoritiis had agreed to drop
all charges and let him return home,
if he “lost” his title to the latest “white
hope,” Jess Willard. He agreed.

He was 37 years old,land much
smaller than the 6-6 252—lb. (but clum-
sy) Willard, but still could’ve easily
defeated him. Johnson hammered
Willard for 15 rounds, assuring his
supremacy, but making sure never to
knock him out.

Finally, in the 26th round, Willard
hit Johnson with an ordinary punch and
down he went. Supposedly knocked
out, Johnson lay there with his right
arm held in the air shielding his eyes
from the sun. Immediately after
Willard was proclaimed the winner,
Johnson sprang (check the ﬁlms) to his
feet and left the ring.

Sadly, Johnson had been lied to; he
could not return safely.

Johnson spent some time in Spain
and became, of all things, a bullﬁghter.
He also took up wrestling and, as usual,
mastered both.

Despite his horrendous treatment by
the United States, Johnson was eager
to work as an*American spy during
World War I, investigating German
submarine operations off the coast of
Spain. -

He went to Mexico for a brief period
in 1919, before ﬁnally consenting to
return no matter what the conse-
quences. He now gladly served his
sentence (which was shortened to 8

A months for good behavior) to be back

among family and old friends.

After leaving prison, Johnson fought
occasionally, but spent most of his time
with a new career, lecturing. His
standing—room-only crowds were
evidence of increasing acceptance,
although he never was completely
accepted.

During his prime, Johnson was vir-
tually, and maybe even literally,
unbeatable. He not only beat top con-
tenders, he toyed with them.

The son of a slave, he stood up to
the white man and challenged the un-
written laws of society. His success
gave others courage to do the same.

Johnson didn’t break the color line.
He grabbed it by the throat and tore it
to shreds! _

In a life ﬁlled with big cigars, ﬂashy
smiles, beautiful blondes, diamonds
and defiance, Jack Johnson not only
changed the course of sports, but he,

more importantly, changed the status

of the black man forever. '

The Pitt ‘News, anuaryv  

Swimmers take win streaktoWVU

’.“~By Gary Geller

Staff Writer

Last weekend, the Pitt women’s
swim team improved its record to 9-0
after a decisive 79-61 victory over
Division II power Clarion. More im-
portantly, the Panthers dominated
every aspect of the swim meet, choos-
ing to invoke an NCAA rule which
allows a team to declare events as ex-
hibitions. According to Coach David
Belowich, Pitt did not need to destroy

: ‘the spirit of the other squad. “There

was no point in running up the score.
We swam very well. We’re not out to
destroy anyone,” he said.

The win was Pitt’s 18th straight dual-
meet triumph, a streak which began in
the 1984-85 season.

Belowich experimented in the
Clarion meet by putting swimmers in
different events. Belowich said, “We

gave people an opportunity to swim
other than their usual events. It makes
it a little more interesting. I think the
team responded well.”

Pitt took an early lead over’ Clarion
as the Panthers won the first event, the
400-yard freestyle relay. The team of
junior Tracy Pﬁster, senior Wendy
Morgan, sophomore Judy Haughton
and sophomore Cindy Rose swam the
relay in a time of 4:06.73, and gave the
Panthers a lead they did not relinquish.
In the 1000-yard freestyle, Chris
Kaucher took first with a time of
10:52.48 and Kathy Bates swam sec-
ond in 11:04.88. Similarly, in the
200-yard freestyle, Tracy Pfister and
Jody O’Neil came in ﬁrst and second
with times of 1:54.71 and 1:55.61
respectively. The score after two
events was a resounding 23-2.

In the 200-yard backstroke,
Clarion’s top freshman, Terry

Messenger, swam a good race and
ﬁnished first with a time of 1:01.66.
Pitt’s Marian Cassidy came in second
in 1:01.83 and NCAA All-America
Sue Hickman finished third in a time
of 1:01.84. It was the first time that
Hickman swam that event this year.
Belowich felt that it was a good idea
to “give her a chance to swim
something else, other than the 50-yard
freestyle.”

Pitt continued its assault against
Clarion as Belowich had an opportunity
to see his top freshman perform.
Maureen Cleary won the 100-yard
breast stroke in 1:08.54. “Maureen had
a really good swim. All of the freshmen
responded well, Belowich said. “I’m
happy with the freshman class, they’re
doing a good job.”

In a close race, Judy Haughton
edged out Clarion’s Elisa Woicicki for
first place in the 200-yard freestyle,

On Saturday, Jan. 25, both the
women’s and the men’s track teams
will be going to Boston University -
to attend the Boston University In-
vitational. The men ran there two
years previously, but had taken only
a relay team. This year, they will
be taking the full team to get a look
at their competition in the con-
ference championship. Head coach
John Vasvary is hoping to use this
meet as a building block for the
conference championship and as a
chance to turn in some good times
due to the strong competition and
good track.

Leading the men will be Lee

Track teams head to Boston

McRae in the 55-meter dash and
Dave Moore in the 800-meter run.
One low note to the meet will be
the fact that Tim Manes will not be
able to compete due to a sprained
ankle. In fact, he will be out of
action for the next two weeks.
The women, on the other hand,
have no injuries, but will be taking
only eight competitors. They will
feature Gloria Azeke in the
800-meter run and the mile relay
team. In addition, the women will
be competing in the 55-meter dash,
the 200-meter dash, the 55-meter
hurdles and the 500-meter dash.
Head coach Steve Lewis is hop-
ing that this will give the women a
good chance to size up their adver-
saries in the Big East conference
since a good many of the teams

from the conference will be in at-
tendance. Lewis also is hoping that
this will give the women a chance
to work on their overall perform-
ance, and a chance for the mile
relay team to improve itself.

 

‘I  '

with a time of 2:07.83. Another
freshman, Tricia Rickert, took third in
2:10.71.

Belowich singled out his divers for
top performances when he said, “I
really can’t say enough about the
divers. They have done the job and
have met the challenge of the competi-
tion.” Junior Tricia Ney, from Chal-
font, Pa. , won the one—meter’and three-
meter diving contests with scores of
242.40 and 259.80.

Belowich also thought that the
seniors performed well in their last
home meet. He said, “I think the
seniors went out in fine fashion.”

When the score became decidedly in
Pitt’s favor, Belowich thought it was
best to swim the ﬁnal two events as ex-
hibitions. He said, “At that point, with
the score 78-46, you have the meet
won. There’s no point in destroying
Clarion on paper. There’s just no point

  

to it.”

Tomorrow, Pitt will take on top-
ranked West Virginia University in
Morgantown at l p.m. Belowich thinks
Pitt has a depth advantage over WVU,
but also thinks that the Mountaineers
have strong performers. “I think we’ll
be in for an interesting meet,” he said.
“We’ll have to overcome their home
field advantage.”

Pitt must contend with WVU’s All-
America Kim Kaufman, in the breast
stroke, and also Ruth Horn in the
100-yard and 200-yard butterﬂy.
Belowich described the rivalry between
the two neighboring schools when he
said, “There’s a lot of internal motiva-
tion to do a number against WVU, Pitt
and West Virginia just don’t like each
other.

“The team has designs of going
undefeated. We don’t want to get
beaten by WVU.”

Pitt women play in

Wednesday night, the Lady Panthers
basketball squad lost to the Villanova
Wildcats 62-53 in a Big East game at
Villanova. The loss dropped Pitt to 7-8
overall and 3-5 in the league while
Villanova improved their record to
12-4 overall and a league—leading 7-1
in conference play. The game marked
the midway point of the Big East
schedule for both teams.

Guard Kim Gannis tied her career
high with 23 points and center Jenny
Tyner contributed 12 points and a
career best 13 rebounds for the Lady

Panthers. Villanova’ was led by

superstar Shelly Pennefather, who :

scored 26 points and pulled down 12
rebounds.

Tomorrow at noon, the Lady Pan-
thers host the Providence Lady Friars
at Fitzgerald Field House. Going into
a Wednesday night contest against
Georgetown, the Lady Friars were
11-4 overall and 5-2 in league play.

Providence has a balanced scoring
attack led by forwards Britt King and
Mary Burke and guard Doris Sable.
King is fourth in the Big East at 17.6
points per game, while Burke places
sixth at 14.7 ppg. Sable, last week’s
Big East Player of the Week, is eighth
in scoring at 14.5 ppg. '
