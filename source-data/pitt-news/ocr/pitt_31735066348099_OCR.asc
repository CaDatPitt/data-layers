§g..Pitt Student Poll Reveals Pm 

Rocky, No VP Fcivorite i 

BY TOM WASELESKI
An overwhelming dissatisfaction
with Nelson Rockefeller as a‘
possible vice presidentwas re-

vealed Saturday in a random poll,

taken on the Pitt campus.
Of the 50 persons interviewed

only 16% expressed approval of the.

former New York governor.
“He shouldn’t be conﬁrmed. If he

r*'I{~is, there’ll be too much‘ big’

 business at the top of the
government,” said Ollie Bennet, a
_Pitt self-designed major.
' His companion, Andy Luck, felt
Rockefeller’s interests “wouldn’t
include poor people. He’s too
narrow-minded; he doesn’t know
what it’s like to be poor.'.”
Speculating that Rockefeller’s
j_number two spot in the government
‘i..-» could become a foot in the door of
the Oval Office, Quince Reynolds
remarked, “If he becomes presi-
dent, I‘ don’t know what will
happen to this country.”
When Rockefeller was nominated

.conﬁrmation problems as

by President Ford three weeks ago,
his conﬁrmation by Congress as the

nation’s 41st vice president seemed _

certain. But recent disclosures
made before the Senate Rules
Committee concerning private gifts
and back taxes
reduced ,Rocky’s chances for
approval. _
The veep-designatefs most dam-
aging release came, Friday night
when he admitted to owing the
Internal Revenue Service $952,718
in back taxes. _ '
One Pitt student saw Rockefeller’s
“a way
for the ..Democrats to block a
Republican stronghold that can be
gained in the ’76 elections.” She
hoped to see him given the nod.
Member of the College Young
Democrats, Joseph Bacon, saw
Rocky unfit to be vice president

-“because of what he did against

Arthur Goldberg and the way he
handled the Attica revolt.” Rocke-

Pitt’s decision to shelve the
“Greenburg Proposal,” a plan to
turn the University’s Greensburg
campus into a two year upper

division institution, came in the-

wake of a disagreement between,
Pitt and the State Board of

Education which claimed more

studies were needed. before‘ the
switch could be made.

Greensburg campus will remain
two year lower division school
enrolling first and second _year
students ‘as do Pitt’s other four
extension campuses. M

Greensburg Campus President
Albert B. Smith, pointed out the
proposal was never really turned
down by- the State. “The sugges-
tionto make us an -upper division
college was made by the University
to the State Board of Education.
But the plan wasn’t refused, the
State simply didn’t act,” he‘ said.
“They claimed they wanted to
make more studies into the subject,
but the Chancellor felt we had
made enough.”

The three major issues faced by
the University Senate this year deal

with tenure, -faculty unionization.

and budgeting,_ according to new
Senate President Frank Slaughter.
“Each year of the Senate’s life is

characterized by ‘involvement in
specific issues,” Slaughter said.

“This ’ year they are" the tenure
commission’s -recommendations,

the unionization issue and the
"question of how budgeting is done.
“There is this question of making

 

Senate Chief Talks Issues

a'.r:ailablel.to the faculty the working
of the budgeting process. In times
of ﬁnancial stringency, theU'niver-
sity needs to planvery carefully
how it spends money. In order to
do that, an institution must look
very carefully at itself.”

Slaughter alluded to the contro-
versial Faculty Activity Plans, part
of which would require teachers in
the School of Education to deﬁne
and fulﬁll goals they would specify
each school year. . The plan’s
opponents blasted it as an attempt
to stiﬂe academic creativity.

“The_ faculty Senate is beginning
to be concerned with the question
as to what degree the administra.;
tion should ask a faculty member to
predict how he is going to make use
of his professional time, and what
his output will be.”

The problem, according to
Slaughter, is one not necessarily of
performance, but prediction of that
performance.

A 34 year old math professor,
Slaughter described his ascen-
dancy to the presidency of the
Senate as a “through the ranks”
process, a succession of ofﬁces, the
most recent being vice-president
until he took on top post October 3.

“The view from the number one
seat,” he said, “is very different
from the view from the number two
seat.

"The most significant difference

elves Greensburg Plans

Consequently, as Chancellor Pos-
var told the University Senate
several weeks ago, the plan was
just put_ “on the back burner.” I

Smith said he " was neither
“particularly surprised or unduly
perturbed that they didn’t act. It
looked like it (the plan) would be
bogged down, ‘so we simply
decided not to pursue this
altemative.”

Executive Assistant to the Chan-
cellor Charles Coble,

piness about the proposal’s prema-
ture death. “Of course we’re
disappointed in a sense,” Coble
asserted. “We spend a lot of time

' studying the problem and trying to

put it through.” He agreed with

Posvar that enough studies had
been done on the proposal. “I feel
we used the best data available and
did exhaustive studies on the whole
idea," he said.

The reality of the situation that
had to be faced, Coble believed,
was “we had someaopposition to
the proposal. So we'll just have to

put it on the shelf for now and _

perhaps when the time looks right
we can propose it again.".

He declined to speculate on the
proper time. ' U

Coble explained the proposal,
which is now suspended in
administrative animation, was de-
signed more as a public service
than as an expansion of Pitt.

“What we had in mind was that
Greensburg would be the equiv-

alent of Pitt’s upper two years, kind ,

of a reverse junior college,” . he
said. “In no way were we going to

‘change the character of the

Greensburg school, we wereisi:»t:ip_-ly
going to change it from a lower
division to an upper division
school.” ‘

Coble termed this an “innovative
idea” which he maintained “would
have been, in our concept, a public
service. We didn’t feel we were
causing any problems for the
other schools."

In fact, according to the president
of Greensburg campus, the plan
was designed specifically to come
to the aid of the many adjacent
schools. “The Greensburg campus
is surrounded by six other lower
division schools,” Smith pointed
out. “The transformation of our
school to an upper level division

would have served the needs of_'

students at the Penn State and
Community College campuses,” he

"said. .
Theireasoning is these students

would then be provided with a
insititution where they
could complete the second two
years of a four year education if
they desired. ‘ .

smearing Goldberg, a former
Supreme Court justice, when he
opposed Rocky in the 1970
gubernatorial election. Rockefel-
ler’s ordering of a police assault
during the Attica prison uprising,
which left 43 persons dead, is also
being scrutinized by the Congress.

A Carlow College freshman, Lynn

Coletta said, “and he doesn't seem

“I like him," Simko told the Pitt
News. “Why wouldhe be a crook
in ofﬁce——he’s so rich."

Dana Bilohlavek called Rockefel-
ler a “political instigator, a big
capitalist.” Another student men-

tioned she didn’t like Rockefeller
“because he’s rich.”

“I think this operation on his wife
came at a good time,” she
observed, wishing to remain
anonymous. “He'll be confirmed. a

be a toss-up. “Too many people in
Congress don't agree with his
handling of New York State.” A

bungling as governor: “I never

‘House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice studying the

? ’s intention to deternine whether both agreements were

However, as Congresswoman Hizabeth Holtzman of New York
indicated during her questioning period, the structure of the hearings
ipteverited the resolution of those doubts. No witnesses were called
' ‘or to the President’s testimony, no preparatory study was done, and
mmittee members were permitted only ﬁve minutes both to ask
questions and receive answers to them. As a result, sufﬁcient time to
=question the President was not available, and the background

Additionally, information revealed in the President’s testimony that

exander Haig had met with Ford eight days before the Nixon
resignation and that the possible pardoning of the President was a
bject of their conversation only served to reinforce the many doubts

‘ The investigations into these issues should be continued when the
Congress reconvenes after the elections. The subcommittee’ of the
 Judiciary Committee should call as witnesses Alexander.Haig,
and even the former president.
conversations relevant to the investigation should be turned over to the
subcommittee by President Ford, and if he fails in this responsibility
"those tapes should be subpoenaed. Also, the Committee should send a

not go unsaid due to time restrictions. -

-1 As President Ford said-during his testimony, it is mandatory that the
business of the Watergate be in the past and not the present. Only in
 way will the most important problems facing this nations today,
including the deteriorating economic condition, be resolved. But,
Watergate cannot be swept under the rug. Even these last vestiges,
the Nixon pardon and the tapes agreement, demand a full hearing, so
the American people's conﬁdence in their political leaders and
governmental institutions can be restored.

US Senate race

On Unconditional Amnesty

BY CHRISTINA ADACHI

The recent actions of President
Ford regarding amnesty provide a
further illustration of the true
nature of justice in this country.
Each day, it is increasingly ap-
parent that there are indeed two
standards of justice: one for the
rich and one for the poor.

At his new conference on Septem-
ber 16, Ford claimed that both his
pardon of Richard Nixon and his
granting of “conditional amnesty”
to Vietnam war resisters were to
“heal the nation’s wounds.” His
lumping together of the war crim-
inal and gangster Richard Nixon
with those who resisted service in
the war was a’ cynical public
relations move. Nixon was respon-
sible for massive death and de-
struction in Vietnam. The war
resisters refused to participate in
that carnage. . '

While Nixon received a total and
unconditional pardon, the war re-

sisters got no such t_hing.According '

to Ford’s proclamation, war resis-
ters will be allowed back into‘ the
country if they agree to a-two-year
stint of compulsory “alternative
service.” Even after serving this

forced labor sentence, resisters will

have to go through the rest of their
lives with the stigma of a “clemen-
cy discharge" -- a less-than-honor-
able discharge. _All “deserters”
will lose the right to Veterans
Adminstration beneﬁts.

Ford resorted to the “amnesty”

ploy to help him weather the storm
of protest over his pardon of Nixon.
Nixon. It was an attempt to patch

I up his growing “credibility gap,”

which is widening after less than
two months in office. Ford needed

Advice to Abortionliights Coalition  

' tion— but worse still when we see

tactics and statements that offend
us" as Catholics...

It is an old, old tactic to, try to
isolate the Catholic church and its
position on moral issues, and then
to say that it is trying to impose its
views on others. We hope this
tactic, which is unworthy of the
ACLU, does not work this time._

Our advice to all the members of
the Abortion Rights ‘Coalition
would be to debate the issue on its
own merits, and not to slander
Catholics and others who disagree
with their position. We would give
this same advice, of course, to
members of the pro-life groups,
that they debate fairly and not, for
example, refer to their opponents
as “murderers.” ‘

We wish_ the ACLU did not render
itself insensitive to the rights of
fathers and the rights of the
unborn...and we regret that ‘this
great organization is being carried
in a wrong direction at this moment
on the abortion issue. Hopefully, it
will be more consistently for human
life.

We will at Tuesday’s board
meeting raise the issue of
anti-Catholic aspects to the stand of

the Abortion Rights Coalition and
we will ask the ACLU, at a
minimum, to disavow itself from
that approach. We will also object

the headlines about his so-called
amnesty order to try to balance out
the blatant injustice of his cover-up
for Nixon’s crimes.

The hypocrisy of American justice
goes beyond the amnesty issue,
however. “Justice” under capita-
lism means that the real punish-
ment is directed only at those who
resist or challenge the right of the
rich to keep the rest of the people ,
living in poverty and insecurity. Its
purpose is to force the masses of
people into accepting the inequality
of this society.

Consider the Attica massacre in
1971, where 43 people were mur-
dered on the direct order of then
New York governor Nelson Rocke-
feller. Why ‘were the Attica
inmates murdered? Because they
were fighting against the inhuman ‘
conditions under which they were
forced to live. And yet 61 of- these
men, who were standing up for
their dignity as human beings, are
now on trial for the Attica revolt. At
}he same, not ‘ a ' single prison
guard, state trooper, National
Guard, or government official faces .
any charges stamming from the
bloody massacre.

Thousands of ‘people "whose only
crime was trying to survive are
rotting'in jail. George Jackson, for
example, spent years in prison for
allegedly stealing $70 and was .
ﬁnally murdered‘ because of *-his
political beliefs. The real “crimes”
of such people are the poverty,
unemployment and desperation
which this system breeds. /

Compare this with the enormity of
Nixon’s crimes. Taking over from
his predecessors Johnson and
Kennedy, he carried through the

people. The lives of 50,1)00 young
Americans and perhaps a million
Vietnamese were snuffed out.

Nixon used the huge power of
government institutions -- the In-
ternal Revenue Service, the CIA,
the FBI -- to harass, disrupt, bur-
glarize and even murder those who
dared dissent against the govern-
ment. I

Nixon’s entire administration --
‘from\the two highest offices in the
land to the head of the “Justice”
Department itself -- was. revealed ’
to be a den of crooks and gangsters
in the pay of the biggest corpora-
tions. 

Nixon free.. Spiro Agnew is free. ,

» And the few of Nixon’s cronies who
have gone to jail serve out short
sentences in country club prisons."
TheVYoung Socialist Alliance and}
the Socialist Workers party are
fighting this corrupt system of
injustice. As the Socialist Workers

Pennsylvania, I call for ‘total'and-
unconditional amnesty for all Viet-
nam war resisters -- including
those who were “dishonorably”
discharged because they stood up
for their rights while. in the service.
' For there to be real justice in this
country, working people and the
oppressed need to take the power
out_ of the hands of the tiny

wield it ‘in the interests of the?
majority. Then we could take over
the half-hearted Watergate inves-
tigations (as well as launching a
.few of our own). We could root
out and bring, to justice all the
corporate thieves and snoopers and
lay the groundwork for a truly
democratic society.

  Senate Chief Talks Issues  

(Continued from Page 1)

I perceive right now is in terms of
planning for the development of
the Senate’s business. That
planning is the responsibility of the
president.

“I have the total planning
responsibility and the responsi-
bility to make the sort of instant
decisions which any._ presiding
individualhas to make.

“I’ve been impressed with what
that entails. My baptism came at
the October 3 meeting when I was
unprepared and unfamiliar with a
major piece of new business.”
[That-business was the controver-
sial Faculty Activity Plans.]

Concerning his idea-of what a
University is about’, Slaughter
described the roles of three distinct,
groups--faculty, students and -ad
ministration. ’ A p '

“The faculty and students are
really what a University is about,”

' Slaughter said, “with the adminis-

tration being.the underpinning’ that
facilitates the faculty’s and student
body’s getting on with the main
business of the institution.
“Most administrators at Pitt who

I’m familiar with see themselves as .-

facilitators rather than principals
which dominate the institution.”

Slaughter said he is not a member
of‘ any group currently vying for
recognition as a bargaining unit
should the faculty vote in favor of
un-ionization. He would not
comment. on his position concern-

ing the issue, calling any such‘

.91,’ _ 

5.‘.

. statement inappropriate in light of

his position as president of the
Senate. '

“I have an obligation to preserve
the University Senate as ‘a forum
for competing points of view on,
among other things, unionization
‘versus nonunionization, and one
bargaining group versus others.”

While admitting he hasn’t given
much thought to speciﬁc problems
of liberal arts colleges, Slaughter
was not as pessimistic as some

 

forecastefs who view the rise. of
vocationalism as an economic
necessity and a harbinger .to liberal
arts disaster. '
“Programs are not justified only
in terms of products they turn out,
that is, undergraduate students.

The response will not be a simple‘ t

minded one.

“The School of -Engineering did
not cease to function becausevthere -
was a_ drastic drop in the number of

applicants a few years ago.”

Trips, depending on the weather
and demand, average one per
week. A member announces at a
meeting he would like to ‘go
camping and asks if others
approve. If he gets no support or if
transportation isn't available, they
design a new trip.

Equipment Chairman Tim Swee-
ney described a typical Robin

basically crazy, will do anything,
once, is not afraid to get dirty, is
ingenious and is involved in 1500
things at one time.”

canoeists from the Merrie Band
found themselves in the middle of
the same run used by the White

boats ﬂipped several times and the
members finally had to use a teapot
to hold one of the canoes together.

Robin Hood is planning a trip to
Allegheny State Park during
Christmas vacation. There will be
downhill and cross-country skiing,.
tobogganing, ice-skating, and
“anything else you can do in the
snow.” Total cost of the trip is $28
for eight days and the money must
be paid this week.

Kline's Son Emphasizes

Grass Roots

BY BILL HADUCK

Claiming a state politician's best
advice is to stay as close to the
people as possible, Gus Kline,‘ son
of imcumbent lieutenant governor
candidate Ernest ‘Kline, said he
was keeping out of the political
limelight in order to get things
done on a “grass roots" level.

“I’d like to get it across that
whatever little bit a ‘person does for
the campaign is important,” he
said in a informal visit Friday at
Pitt’s College Young Democrats
(CYD) office.

Kline, a student _at Duquesne
University Law School felt more.
people don’t get involved in politi-
cal campaigns because they think
their efforts would be of little
consequense. _

“Nojob is less important than any
other,” Kline stressed. “It’s
unfair to think that the state
democratic chairman has a much
more important job than, say,
general groups atthe lowest levels.

People in organizations like CYD
have a much better feel of local
politics."

‘ Kline, said his father,‘ and incum-

bent Governor Milton Shapp are

running on a platform of demon-
strated leadership.

“Everything’s not perfect in the
state, but we’ve done a decent job
and we feel we can continue doing
it.

“One of the things the Republi-
cans have brought up is that Mr.

P O O '0
olitickmg
\

"Shapp didn't pay any income tax in
’69. Itiwas due to his business
losses. but they tried to smear him
for it. l'd like to know what Drew
Lewis (Shapp’s gubernatorial op-
ponent) would do if Snelling and
Snelling had any business losses.”
Lewis is president and chief execu-
tive of Snelling and Snelling Inc.,
a national job placement company.

“I think the Democrats will win
and you might well see the Demo-
crats recapture the state legisla-
ture. That will probably be a
national trend."

Kline didn’t expect the lingering
shadow of Watergate to effect the
gubernatorial elections to any great
extent.

“I don't think my father and Mr.
Shapp need the dilemma of the
Republican party to help them get
in," he said. .

Kline refused to-speculate of the
possiblity of his father running for
governor in 1978. A visible trend in

the past has been for a lieutenant .

governor to seek the governorship
when the man he had served under
leaves ofﬁce. “We have this
election to worry about first,” he
said. - ,
‘Concerning his own political fu-
ture, Kline seemed uncertain.

“Politics is such a diverse ﬁeld,”
he said, “Ireally don’t know what
I'll be doing. I have to get through
law school first. Whatever I do
politically probably wouldn’t be in
the forefront.

* Taylor, Crwenaugh Lead

Cubs Past Keiii State_

BY RON SIEGLE

“Hey up there on the varsity-—

you better make room for me.”
That thought is undoubtedly go-
ing through the head of freshman
speedster Willie Taylor, who scor-
' ed five touchdowns‘ Friday to lead

the Pitt junior varsity to a 46-27
. \ trouncing of Kent State.

Taylor got into gear early, fielding
a bouncing kickoff. that three.of his
teammates should have covered
and bursting through a.hole on the
left side untouched for an 84 yard
touchdown romp. I

The Panthers missed. a two-point
conversion, and when ‘(the first
quarter ended without further scor-
ing, thoughts of a high-scoring
game were unfounded. 4

But Taylor and quarterback Matt
Cavenaugh had other ideas. Fol-
lowing two second quarter touch-
downs by the Golden Flashes that

“E
/

gave them a 15-6 lead, the Cubs got ’

into gear.
The second KSU touchdown ’came
“with 2:07 left in the half, but Pitt
coach Bob Leahy-wisely elected to
 go for a score rather than run out

the clock. It only took 22 seconds to .

score, as Cavenaugh uncorked a
57-yard pass to Taylor, who pulled
it in on the ’left sideline and
scampered into the endzone. Tom
Sindewald’s two-point conversion
left Pitt behind by one at the half.

The Cubs came out flying in the
second half, with Sindewald scor-
ing before three minutes elapsed,
putting Pitt ahead to stay.

Before the third quarter ended,
Cavenaugh found Taylor of an
82-yard touchdown pass, giving
P,itt a 26-15 edge that seemed safe
in view of the way the Cub defense

-r‘“' was thwarting the Flashes, but had
Pitt stopped scoring there, it would
have lost the game. ,
Perhaps tired of watching Taylor
.cross the goal-line, Cavenaugh, a
613” freshman from Youngstown,
rolled out ‘and scored. himself, then

 
    

1:to'ok’ the :.cojnv'ersi'oi1. in,’ himsel_f_.[ to.

    

    

MATT CAVANAUGH

put Pitt up 34-15. - . e
That score was the ﬁrst of four
touchdowns in’ a span of 68

seconds, 80 yards for a score, but
Davenaugh countered with a 43-
pass to Taylor, who made a fine
leaping catch behind his defender
and scampered into the endzone.
Ownes completed the ﬂurry with a

‘ 60-yard touchdown-run" after some

fancy footwork at the line. Paex
rounded out the scoring by hitting
Taylor with a 14-yard TD pass.

Booters Meet Talented WI/U  j

\

BY SPAN OS

The Pitt and West Virginia soccer
teams clash Tuesday evening at 8
pm at Pitt Stadium, and on paper it
appears the Panthers will be
outclassed. Three All-Americans
are back from last year’s WVU
squad, and the Mountaineers‘ also
boast two Junior College transfers
who were All-Americans at the J .C.
level last year. - -

Center fullback Joel Okhakhu will
do his best to intimidate the
Panthers and his 6’3” frame will
help him tremendously. Jack
Cordoso and Manny Matps, the two
other all-Americans, provide the
bulk of the scoring punch for the
Mountaineers. ,

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

That second half last week against
West Virginia was no» fluke, fans.
The improving Pitt Panthers put
two halves just like it back-to-back
Saturday, and the result was a
35-11 cakewalk over‘ outclassed
Boston College. L

And Tony Dorsett’s return to 1973
form a week ago was no fluke
either. T.D. romped for 191 yards
and three touchdowns, including
eye-popping sprints of 61 (and 74
yards that buried the Eagles.

“Excellent. excellent, excellent,”
raved head coach Johnny Majors.
“I’m very, happy with the entire
performance of the team.” The
Panthers dominated the game both
offensively and defensively, aver-_
aging 7.0 yards per offensive play
while. limiting Boston College to
3.6. ..

Dorsett’s first breakaway, ‘in the
mid-third quarter, came on a single
sprint-action play to the right of
Mike Carey’s center position.
Carey opened a crack of daylight,
and the All-American needed no
more. _ I

Dorsett "nearly. left the crowd of
32,149 in shock as he spun away
from a tackle and danced backward
into the Eagle secondary. T.D. left
everything—even part of his jersey
—behind him on a 61-yard dash
that put Pitt in command, 21-3.

He also scored from 74 yards away
in‘the fourth quarter to end the
scoring. “I never saw ‘anybody turn
it on like he did when he hit that
hole,” Majors said of the play.

Dorsett’s BC. counterpart, All-A-
'merican tailback Mike Esposito, sat
out the ballgame with a.combina-
tion strain and bruise of the right
knee. But even All-Americans
can't run through people, and on
this day the Pitt defense probably
could have stopped anyone.

Before the game, Majors called

the BC offensive line “possibly. the.

best we’ll face all year.” But the
P’anther defensive front, led as
usual by Gary Burley yet out-
weighed by 19 pounds per man,

A neutralized the Eagle charge and

enabled linebackers Arnie Wea-
therington and Kelcy Daviston to
dominate. ’

The first time the Panthers got the
ball, Daniels drove them 80 yards
in 10 plays. Dorsett, who got
terriﬁc blocking all day, followed
fullback Bob Hutton over left end

they were going out of style,” Pitt
coach Leo Bemis said of Cordoso.
If in that statement it appears
Bemis is worried about WVU, he
is, to a degree.

“They are an excellent bunch of
soccer players with a lot of skills,"
said Bemis. Yet being worried
about WVU doesn’t mean that
Bemis feels the Cats can't win.

“We’re working very hard in
preparation for this game. Our
team isn’t awed by West Virginia.
If our defense can hold up, we can
take the ball to WVU.-”

for a four-yard touchdown, after

using a well-executed I crackback’

block by Karl Farmer to spring for
16 yards earlier in the drive. 5
BC cut Pitt's lead to 7-3 after one
«quarter -when left-footed Fred
Steinfort, a native German, dropp-
ed a 52-yard field goal just beyond
the crossbar. _Steinfort’s kick tied
the Boston College record he
himself had set against Navy last
year, and was his third success
from 50 yards or farther this year.
Early in the second frame, Pitt

‘launched a 59-yard, seven-play

drive that ended with Daniel’s
11-yard pass to flanker Bruce
Murphy on a difficult wrong-way
rollout. Dorsett’s -16-yard sweep
and Elliot Walker’s 21-yard burst

up the middle highlighted the drive ,

the West Chester game which they
lost 7-1 in the rain, and don’t
expect WVU to have a cakewalk on
Tuesday evening.

Two developments which oc-
curred in the past week may affect
Pitt, however. Frank Bucci, Pitt’s
starting goalie, sprained his left
ankle, and John Wallace, who had
been starting on the offensive line,
quit the team for personal reasons.
Fred Dohrmann w-ill replace Bucci
in goal, and Bemis will ‘have to

rearrange his team to accommo-
date Wallace’s departure.

Pitt has played well in the past
four games, and "if" the trend
continues against West Virginia,
the Panthers could possibly leave
the stadium with a victory.
Defense has been the forte of the
Cats in the last four games this
year, having yielded only four goals
during that stretch, while the
offense has scored a mediocre five
' goals. Against West Virginia, Pitt

will need as much of both as they.

PITTSBURGH AP--Safety Glen
Edwards intercepted a desperation
fourth down pass by Mike Phipps
in the waning minutes to preserve
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 20-16 win
over the Cleveland Browns Sunday
in a National Football League
game.

Cleveland faced fourth down and _

seven at the Pittsburgh 17 yard line
with 2:23 to play when Edwards

snatched Phipps’ toss over the -

middle and returned it 59 yards to
help Pittsburgh boost its record ti

“ 4.1.1.

Phipps, who marched the Browns
54 yards before his last ditch toss,
had also guided two Cleveland
touchdown drives in the ﬁnal two
minutes of the ﬁrst half that had
pulled the Browns, 15, to within
one point at intermission.

Although Pittsburgh quarterback

_ Joe Gilliam completed just ﬁve of

18 tosses for 70 yards, the
punchless Steelers survived with
the help of second half ﬁeld goals
of‘31 and 26 yards by Roy Gerela.

GereIa’s first boot came early in
the third quarter and capped a 58

- On the opening series of the
fourth quarter, Don Cockroft
booted a 21 yard ﬁeld goal for the
Browns to pull them within 17-16.

But Gerela added an insurance
kick a series later on a 54 yard drive
that included runs of 29 and 13
yards by Franco Harris.

Trailing 14-0 with just two
minutes left in the second quarter,
the Browns erupted for two
touchdowns before intermission to
pull to 14-13 at the half.

Quarterback Phipps scrambled 18
yards for the ﬁrst Cleveland score
with 1:57 left in the half to cap a 50
yard drive that began after Billy
Lefleur’s 41 yard kickoff return.

With eight seconds left, Phipps
passed 14 yards to Milt Morin and
the Steeler lead was preserved only
by the ensuing deflection ’of
Cockroft's extra point try by
defensive end L.C. Greenwood.
Morin’s score was set up by a 46
yard pass from Phipps to Gloster
Richardson. The play helped the
Browns to a 134-98 edge in total
