Premeclitation?

Neighbor beaten, strangled, and
dragged through hole in cellar wall

Anthony Breznican

New evidence indicates the brutal
murder of a South Oakland resident by
her neighbor may have been premedi-
tated, as police confirmed today that a
small tunnel was found leading from
Ann Hoover’s home into the house
where she was found dead.

Lawn Street resident and one—time
Pitt student Roy Kirk may have broke
into Hoover’s home by boring a hole
through a com-

 

the hole to his building,” Freeman said.

 “He was wrapping her severed parts

when we found him, and we believe he
was hoping to get them out of the
house and dispose of them.”

Kirk was discovered chopping
apart Hoover’s dead body yesterday
morning after both failed to appear in
court over a lawsuit filed against Kirk
by Hoover and several other neigh-
bors. The suit alleged Kirk’s crumbling
rowhouse was causing water damage
to their adjoining homes and attracting
vermin.

FBI says bearing of black youth I
may become federal case

Around the World

JERUSALEM — Israeli newspaper
Yediot Ahronot is questioning whether
or not Friday’s bombing was a suicide.

Investigators asked whether
Islamic militants gave the man the
bomb and told him to plant it in the
cafe. The report says the militants may
have set off the bomb by remote control
while the man was still in the cafe.

The bomber’s personal profile does
not match that of previous suicide
bombers. According to Yediot Ahronot,
Islamic militant groups usually choose
unemployed, young, single men for
bombings. The Friday bomber was
married with four children.

The blast killed him and three
Israeli women.

TOKYO — An earthquake has injured
at least 16 people in southern Japan.

Police say falling objects hurt some
people. One man was burned while
cooking during the earthquake.

The quake caused landslides and
damaged homes. It had a magnitude of
6.2 and struck about 560 miles south-
west of Tokyo. The quake was followed
by a series of aftershocks, but officials
say there is no danger of tidal waves.

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — A cable TV _

study warns that the new TV rating"
aren’t effective in keeping kids away
from restricted programs. The study
says the ratings can actually draw
kids to programs with sex and vio-
lence. It encourages parents to pay
even more attention to the programs
their children are watching.

CHICAGO — A brutal racial beat-
ing in the city may become a federal
case. -

Three white teenagers allegedly
attacked a black youth on his bicycle
last Friday. The victim, 13-year-old
Lenard Clark, remains unconscious
at Cook County Children’s Hospital.

The FBI says it’s reviewing the
attack for possible civil rights viola-
tions. Rev. Jesse Jackson and other
ministers have visited the boy. They
urge the public to pray for his recov-
cry.

The witness who identified the
three suspects has received threats
and has been placed under protec-
tion.

Many students struggle daily with
weight problems. Fad dieting doesn’t
seem to work, at least not over the long
term. However, the key to losing
weight may be easier than any diet cre-
ated.

According to Student Health dieti-
cian Debbie Luffey, the best way to lose
weight and keep it off is to eat nutri-
tiously and exercise regularly. March,
which is National Nutrition Month,
seems the most obvious time to start.

“March is a good time to evaluate
your diet and make permanent changes
that you can stick with,” Luffey said.

Fad dieting, a common practice
among dieters, often turns out to be an
exercise in futility, according to Luffey.

“Most people gain the weight back
that they have already lost within a
year,” Luffey said.

One of the newest fad diets to come
on the scene, the fat—free—food diet, can
also backfire. According to Luffey, fat-
free foods generally aren’t as ﬁlling as
regular foods, causing a person to eat
more. Since fat—free foods aren’t calo-
rie—free, you might not lose as much
weight as you think.

“If you eat a whole box of fat—free
cookies, it doesn’t matter that they’re
fat—free, because you just took in 1,000
calories,” Luffey said.

Contrary to popular belief, in order
to lose weight, a person must watch

Thursday, March 27, I997

 

both fat grams and calories. According
to Luffey, for the average woman to
lose weight, she should shoot for a
daily intake of around 50-70 grams of
fat and 2,000 calories. As for men, the
ideal range is about 75-100 grams of fat
and 3,000 calories per day.

According to Student Health edu-
cation administrator Shirley Haberrnan,
it is dangerous to completely eliminate
fat from your diet. The human body
requires essential fatty acids to function
properly, Haberman said.

Eating nutritiously to lose weight
does not mean that you’ll never eat
another sweet again. According to
Luffey, the key is moderation.

“If you generally choose fruit and
pretzel sticks, but occasionally splurge
on a candy bar, it won’t make much of
a difference,” Luffey said.

As students, it is often impossible
to eat right. Three meals a day is just a
luxury which scheduling doesn’t pro-
vide the opportunity for it. The best
way to compensate for this is to eat
many healthful snacks throughout the
day, Luffey said. Carrying an apple to
class with you is just as easy as stop-
ping at the vending machine for a bag
of chips.

“The key is variety and moderation.
It’s kind of hard to overeat on fruits and
vegetables,” Luffey said.

If students have any additional
questions about losing weight through
nutrition, call the Health Education
Office at 383-1830.

already ﬁll all four lanes on the block.

“I’m worried a funnel could be
worse [than a closing],” said O’Connor.

Jen Molluso, director of the Student
Government Board’s Bigelow Task
Force, agreed with O’Connor.

“I’m glad that [City Council]
acknowledged the compromise still
needs a lot of wor .” said Molluso.
“Students realized trafﬁc really will be
congested.”

Molluso said the city needs to take
steps to accommodate for the traffic that
would be created and rerouted by a
pinch. She added that she wants city
council to recognize students as a factor
when making these decisions.

Molluso said the Bigelow Task
Force will sponsor a demonstration next
Wednesday at 12 noon outside of the city
council chambers in opposition of the
narrowing.

“I want [council] to know we have a
voice and can’t be disregarded,” she
said. “Whatever their next step is, I want
to make sure they come to us.  We’re
still pushing for a complete closure [of

Bigelow.]”
The rally that SGB had planned for

yesterday morning didn’t happen.
Instead three members of the board, and
two members of SGB’s governmental
relations committee went down to the
city council meeting. Board Member
Christa Douaihy said that some mem-
bers of the Campus Women’s
Organization had planned to show their
support, but were unable to attend at the
last minute.

SGB President Justin DalMolin said
that because of the short‘ amount of time
between the announcement of the rally
and the city council meeting, SGB decid-
ed to use this time to scope out the lay of
the land and plan their next move.

“Next week we’ll have all kinds of
people,” DalMolin said. “Our plan is to
have everyone speak at the council meet-
ing and basically annoy them until they
give us what we want.”

DalMolin went on to say that anyone
can speak at the council meeting for up
to three minutes, and he planned to have
at least 30 students there to use that time.

“They aren’t low, but they’re not com-

petitive for admission into medical
schools,” said Georgine Matemiak, the

I center’s director. “That, I think, is a real

good demonstration of how we’re not talk-
. ing about people who cannot read.”

To do better, Materniak said, students
need to focus on critical reading and think-
ing skills, and on being analytical. A spe-
cialist, she argued, could help teach read-
ing techniques to hone those abilities.

Jeanne Christy, the pre—med adviser,

? agreed. Her ofﬁce implemented a new pro-
gram last year to help reduce the anxiety
levels of pre—med students by helping them
learn how to prepare themselves for the
test. Students can join in weekly MCAT
study sessions and take practice tests on
selected Saturdays which will be sent off,
scored, and returned to students, who then
will know which areas they are weakest in.

Christy called the program a success
and backs this up with this year’s numbers.
The national average in verbal reasoning
was again 8.5. Pitt’s average was 8.7. The
national average for those accepted rose to
9.6, and Pitt students accepted topped this
with a 10. Christy said most medical
schools are looking for 10s in all areas.

Even with the program in place,
Christy said, she wants Pitt to hire a read-
ing specialist to help pre—med students and
others. “[Students] need to be concentrat-
ing on actually comprehending what
they’re reading and doing it quickly. 
Reading comprehension is not scientiﬁc,
and that distracts some students.”

Phillipa Benson, a writing specialist
who teaches W—courses in psychology,
agreed that training in reading is weak.

“People aren’t trained to read in the
way that is valued in those kinds of tests,”
Benson said. “Basic training in reading
and writing, at least for science students, is
extremely weak. Not that they’re not
exposed to good opportunities to learn aca-
demic reading and writing skills, but to get
any training to read and write for real-
world rhetorical situations, training is min-
imal.  Learning how to deconstruct a
Madonna video is not going to get some-
one very far in the real world.”

Benson said the duties of a specialist
should include teaching teachers how to
infuse literacy and critical reading skills

' into the curriculum, including science and
engineering courses.

“[Most instructors] don’t know how to
teach you to get from bad writing to good
writing, but they can’t even recognize bad
reading,” Benson said.

Student responses

Most students seem to think that the
addition of a reading specialist would help
undergraduates get more out of their class-
es.

“I think it would be very beneﬁcial. I
know I would beneﬁt from it,” said Rene
Alford. a junior in the College of Arts and
Sciences. who said she would work with a
specialist depending on how much time
she had.

 

THE, PI'l"I' NEWS 5

 ROM PAGE 1

Daniel Carr, a sophomore in the CAS,
said that even people without reading
problems could beneﬁt from having a spe-
cialist on campus. “[That person] should
have quick tips for speed reading, teach
skills in general, and maybe have some
answers if somebody has a lot of problems
with distractions  like [attention—deﬁcit
disorder].”

Students also expressed concern about
where the money would come from. “It
really all depends on where the funding
comes from,” said Nathan Bedford, a
junior in the School of Engineering. “It’s
not a question of how beneﬁcial it would
be, if we have to cancel other programs.”

Lisa Foster, a CAS sophomore, said
she probably wouldn’t need a specialist
either, but that some people she knew
might be interested. “I think it could be
helpful to some people.”

A number of students worry that high
schools aren’t teaching students how to
understand the books they’re reading.

“I think that a lot of people in high
school aren’t taught what the most effec-
tive ways to study and to read are, not that
they can’t read,” said Jason Gilmore, a
CAS junior. “The University should do
whatever it can to help students who might
not have the best classes in high school to
make their transition easier.”

Sharmon Gemberling, another junior,

"agreed. “I think everyone should have a

chance to excel at school, and any way
[Pitt] can help would be good.”

Funding challenges

If the center is to get any additional
funding, it will probably be decided when
the provost and chancellor agree on next
ﬁscal year’s budget.

Any additional funds will probably
come from reallocations, meaning the
money will be shifted to the center from
another area; one unit has to lose funding
for another else to get it.

“I know that when we vie for funding
for support services, that that funding is
coming out of the same pot of money that
is set aside for instruction,” said
Materniak. “I’m very aware of the balance
in the decisions being made. Those are
tough decisions.”

In September, Provost James Maher,

announced his plans to spend $1.25 mil-
lion to improve the “quality of life” for
undergraduate students. That money
includes plans for hiring an LD specialist,
putting computer-network ports in every
dorm room, improving the registration and
ﬁnancial—aid processes, and experimenting
with living-leaming dorms.

Even staunch supporters like
Professor Maureen Greenwald and
Matemiak are forced to acknowledge the
risk of taking funds from one program to
give to another.

“What we have is a pie that is only so
large that we have to borrow from Peter to
pay Paul.” Greenwald said. “How do we
enhance undergraduate education while
reorganizing and downsi7.ing?”

other properties around the area owned
by Kirk. Freeman had no further com-
ment about the case, but said he will be
publicizing new findings in the next few
days.

Those who knew Hoover and Kirk
are still reeling from the news, and say
there was never any indication that an
argument over property could take such
a grisly turn.

“[Kirk] was always very nice,” said
Phillip Cossack, who lives on the other
side of Hoover’s residence. “He used to
help Ann out with her own renovations
whenever he could.”

Cossack pointed to some reﬁnished
porch beams stretching from Hoover’s
home to Kirk’s.

 

repeatedly took him to housing court,
which resulted in nearly $50, 000 worth
of fines.

“She brought in on herself,” said
Mary Ellen Cossack.

But other neighbors strongly dis-
agree, saying Kirk was always negligent
and uncooperative.

“Sure, [Hoover] was always asking
him to fix his home and renovate his
other properties, but she was reasonable.
What he did was inhuman,” said Chris
Fromme, whose home overlooks Kirk’s.

Maury Burgwin and his wife live
several houses down from Kirk’s build-
ing and were also involved in the law-
suit against him, but said his brutal reac-
tion to their suit had nothing to do with

How to rally the right way

The Student Government Board attempted to have a rally to
close Bigelow Boulevard during yesterday’s Pittsburgh City
Council meeting. They cancelled it yesterday morning, realizing
that there was not enough time between the announcement and the
actual event for anyone to show up. For future reference, we would
like to give them some advice about how to properly pull off a rally.

First, planning is everything. Let people know what you want
and how you want to go about getting it Have sign-making meet-
ings before hand Line up some rousing speakers. _

Second, advertise the rally. How are people going to know to
show up if they don’t know is going on in the ﬁrst place? Take out
some advertisements in local papers. Hang up ﬂyers all around
campus andthroughoutOak1and PutitintheCampusAlert, and
talk about it in your open meetings.

Third, get other groups and organizations to sponsor the rally
with you. They can help you get people to attend They can share
the burdens of organizing and advertising it. Have the Pitt adminis-
tration sign on; it beneﬁts them the most. Ask teachers to excuse stu-
dents from class while they see how the First Amendment works.

Also, make sure the people from your own organization are in

 Present a united front If you can’t get your own people

 

L to care, how can you expect to get other people to care?

Fourth, get a charismatic leader to champion your cause. You
need to have someone out front that people will follow, someone
who can articulate your needs and wants. This person doesn’t have
tobeJ.F.K, hejustneedstobealeader.

Fifth, make sure the media will be there. This means inforrn—
ing more than one source of media You want as many people to
know about it as possible, not only the people who are in atten-

 Try to get print, radio, and TV coverage. The purpose of a
rally is to let people know what you want, that other people want

the same thing, and how you intend to get it.

y Last but not least, you should have a rally on campus to bolster
the one you are having off campus. Some people, due to class and
work schedules, will not be able to make it oﬂ"-campus to show their
support Give them a way to participate as well.

Now that you have a handy set of guidelines, there is no rea-
son why you can’t easily plan your own rally, and raise attendance
and awareness at the same time. Happy protesting!

The problem

 

Here is a simple math prob-
lem:

Let’s say someone was to
offer you 450 dollars’ worth
of debit which you can only
use for a period of nine
months, which you have to
pay $570 for up front, and
any of the $450 which is not
used at the end of this time
period is forfeited. Would
you take this deal? No? Well,
how about if you also could
only spend this money on
their product and service
which are priced at their dis-
cretion? Still no‘? Well, how
about if the product and ser-
vice were considered below
average, and overpriced with
poor and often rude service? I
thought that might change
your mind.

As you probably guessed,
I am referring to our wonder-
ful food-service contracts. I
am not going to write about
how poor the food quality is,
or how slow or bad the ser-
vice is, mainly because some
people may actually enjoy
our cafeteria food and selec-
tion. I’ll discuss the real
problem with our food ser-
vices, the fact that we are get-
ting ripped off. It wouldn’t be
so terrible if we all had the
choice to choose whether we
get ripped off or not, but the
University actually forces
students who live on campus

with food services isn't
the food; it's that they're ripping us off

to purchase a meal plan.

How does the food ser-
vice department rip you off?
First, they charge you for a
set number of blocks, which
you have to use or you forfeit
them. They set the cash
equivalency value at a price
which is substantially lower
than what you have already
prepaid. They justify this set
price by pricing the meals in
the all-you—can-eat cafeterias
at a much higher rate. They
do this knowing full well that
rarely do students ever pay
cash at such places. An exam-
ple of such an inﬂated rate
would be the 1997-98 dinner
price as $8.00. Now, I ask
you, would anyone ever pay
$8.00 for dinner at a cafeteria
when he could walk down the
street to Hemingway’s and
get dinner for the same price
or less? Not if it is his money.
This $8.00 is also a little less
than a 20-percent increase in
price from this year’s special
$6.75 rate.

Now, I was curious as to
approximately how much
money you get ripped off per
meal plan, so I decided to do
the math and also looked
ahead to how much you will
get ripped off next year. Here
is what I found.

The figures for actual
value were estimated by sim-
ply multiplying the amount of
blocks by the cash—equivalen-
cy value, and do not even
account for the usual circum-

stances of unused blocks or
underutilized blocks (spend-
ing one block on a value less
than $4.50). If these were to
be accounted for, the money
that you lose would be much
higher. 8

It would not be so terrible
if you were getting ripped off
like this, and you had the
choice to purchase the plan,
because then the loss of
money is due to your own
stupidity or carelessness.
However, it is completely
unethical for the University
to force students to get swin-
dled like this. This kind of
behavior has often been justi-
fied that it ensures that fresh-
man or on-campus students
get enough meals; however,
this explanation shows us
that the University is treating
such students as juveniles
who need baby-sitting instead
of young adults at an institu-
tion for higher learning.

By these practices, I
would like to know exactly
what type of higher learning
this University is instilling
into its student body. I always’
thought that you save money
by buying at a bulk rate, at
least that is what I learned in
class at this University.
Maybe it is time for the
University to practice what
they teach.

rue hm NEWS

Affirmative action needs to be fixed,

 

Whenever people ask me what I care
the most about, I usually respond by saying
that economics and foreign affairs interest
me. Anyone who reads my columns would
be hard—pressed to remember the last time I
talked about social issues. This week, how-
ever, I was spurred into writing down how I
felt about aﬁinnative-action programs after
I ﬁnished reading my latest issue of
Newsweek.

Entitled “Black Like Who?” the mag-
azine’s cover story this week dealt with the
schism in the Afiican—American communi-
ty between the younger and older genera-
tions. After reading the article, I was both-
ered by the rampant pessimism of younger
African—American males. Despite the
advances African-Americans have made
over the last 30 years, many black men felt
they were still battling a system stacked
against them without the support of their
elders. One ‘man in his 20s remarked that his

parents “feel like because I don’t have to sit '

on the back of the bus  racism is gone and
our generation is on Easy Street. But it ain’t
that simple.”

It is ironic that there is such pessimism
over the future in the Aﬁican-American
community. The civil-rights programs of
the last 30 years have done much to allevi-

ate the problerns facing African-‘Americans.
A few years ago Hemy Louis Gates, the
head of Harvard’s Aﬁican-American
Studies department, said that “never before
have so many blacks done so well.”
Economist Peter F. Drucker noted: “In the
last 50 years since the Second World War,
the economic position of African-
Ameiicaris in America has improved faster
than that of any other group in American
social history — or in the social history of
any country. Three-ﬁfths of America’s
blacks rose into the rniddle-class incomes;
before the Second World War the ﬁgure
was one—twentieth.”

Which brings up a good question:
given how well African-Americans seem to
be doing economically, should the govem—
ment eliminate these programs altogether?

It is important to remember that these
programs have done a lot to help prominent
African-Americans. Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, for example, was adrnit-
ted to Yale Law School under a 1971 affir-
mative-action program (ironically, critics of
these policies have held up Thomas as a
shining example of how minorities can
work hard and succeed without govemment
help. Radio windbag Rush Limbaugh
called him “a man who has escaped the
bonds of poverty by methods other than
those prescribed by these civil-rights orga-
nizations”). In 1983 Thomas praised aﬂir-

rnative-action programs, saying: “But for
them, God only knows where I would be
today. These laws and their proper applica-
tion are all that stand between the ﬁrst 17
years of my life and the second 17 years.”

Afﬁmiative action is a powerful issue
with voters. In California Pete Wilson
bashed afﬁrinative-
action programs in his
successful quest to get
re—elected as governor
of the state in 1994.
Recent polls show that
African-Americans and
whites disagree heavily
on whether or not aﬂir—
mative—action policies
ought to be continued. 
When asked “Do you beheve that where
there has been job discrimination against
blacks in the past, preference in hiring or
promotion should be given to blacks
today?”, 42 percent of the American public
said yes in 1985, against 46 percent who
said no. Ten years later the gap widened to
the point where 33 percent of the public
agreed against 55 percent.

I was discouragedto read an editorial
by an afﬁrmative-action proponent in USA
Today over the weekend which advocated
that since African-Americans contribute 30
percent of all box office receipts in the
movie business today, they should also get

 

Thursday, March 27, ‘I997

not trashed

30 percent of the Oscar nominations. That
sort of insistence in the equality of the result
over the equality of the opportunity is a rot-
ten idea. In 1871, famed abolitionist
Frederick Douglass attacked the idea of
racial quotas, calling them “absurd as a mat-

ter of practice,” and ridiculed the idea that

African-Americans
“should constitute one-
eighth of the poets,
statesmen, scholars,
authors, and philoso-
phers.” Douglas said
that quotas “might
serve to keep up the
very prejudice, which
is so desirable to banish
 by promoting an image
of blacks as privileged wards of the state.”
So what should be done? I consider
myself a part of what columnist Jonathan
Alter calls “the mushy middle” on the sub-
ject. I think that it would be a mistake to
both end these programs altogether and to
continue them in their present form. I agree
with what President Clinton said about
affirmative action: “Mend it. Don’t end it.”
I.et’s keep the programs that work, but
remember that they ought to be only tem-
porary. .

  
   

Michael Berquist thinks it is time to rethink
aﬁ‘irmative—acti0n programs.

Kevin Willard slam
is out of bounds...

In my more than ﬁve decades of asso-
ciation with the University of Pittsburgh,
and as a former feature editor of The Pitt
News many years ago, this is the first time
I have felt compelled to write a letter to the
editor and comment on a recent column by
your sports columnist.

The column [by your sports editor] that

. appeared last week  dealing with Kevin

\Villard was the most uncalled-for and vit-
riolic column I have read, even surpassing
Mr. Smyzik’s blast a few days earlier. If the
intent was to criticize the Pitt basketball
team, or even Kevin Willard, it could have

, been written in a sensible and nonpersonal

manner.

Let me call your attention to the recent
situation at Harvard Law School, where a
potential lawsuit against their newspaper
was just recently settled. A professor
claimed that a columnist generated emo-
tional distress and he sued. The case was
settled subsequently. If your intent was to
generate emotional distress on a young
man, I am sure that you succeeded.

To have been fair, you might examine
all the games in which Kevin played and
become instrumental in helping Pitt win.

Your position as sports editor, recog-
nize, gives you the power to write and say
anything you want, and this is supported by
freedom of the press, but to attack an ath-
lete who has contributed is completely

uncalled for and irrespon-

sible.

...Way out

I carmot and may
never be able to express
my disappointment in 

The Pitt News. The article “Daddy
Dearest: The Kevin Willard Story,” print-

ed in the  March 13 edition of The Pitt
News was horrendous.  Hopefully, [the
student body] won’t take the opinion of
someone who can only ﬁnd the negative
‘within a team that has had an amazing
season....

. As sports editor, you are the one to
surely be discredited if you are reporting

unfounded statistics on the team.  Mr.
Grove, you are the authority for [The Pitt
News] on sports. Tell us, where did you get
the stats  that Kevin Wﬂlard was number
one in the assist—tumover ratio for the team?

You go on to pull Willard’s score ‘from
the Duquesne game. “He “even went off for
11 points in one half.”‘You say this as
though it was pure luck.  [Eleven] points
against Duquesne in college basketball was
nothing but hard work 

[You] are nursing delusions if you
think Trees basketball is in the sarrre league
as the Pitt Pantlrer’s basketball team.

One must question your motives for
voicing such an article. Pitt basketball has

 

player, especially the
coach’s son (a direct
reﬂection on the coach)
reﬂects badly on the
team....

I can certainly say that fortunately, the

intended target of your article, Kevin .

Willard, will only beneﬁt from your igno-
rance and hostility. He will be a stronger
person and most certainly better for it.

I hope that in the future you willtake
into consideration the responsibility of your
position. Many turn to the Sports page in
search of valuable, credible sports perspec-
tives. I must warn the student body — you
will not ﬁnd it in Matt Grove’s column.

Editorial molests SGB

This letter is in response to the editori-
al which ran in Pitt News

on Monday, March 24 titled, “Closed door,

meetings are raping the student body.” Not
only was this editorial personally offensive
 it was not justiﬁed in certain areas.
Primarily, your segment on the SGB’s
“closed doors” is erroneous. Every
Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. the student gov-
ernment board has a meeting open for any-

one to attend. Furthermore,  the Student
Government Board has  monthly “town
hall meetings,” where the students can talk
directly to us and  administrators. Now,
while we may have a plamiing session that
is speciﬁc for only the elected oﬂicials (for
us to talk about our own personal agendas),
that does not limit the power of the individ-
ual student who [can] visit our ofﬁoe ﬁve
days a week, usually from 9 a.m. until 10
p.m., and attend the weekly meeting or the
town hall meeting to voice their concerns.
Also, the fact that  actions by Student
Government Board can in any way be cor-
related with “Raping the student body” is
appalling. As journalists, don’t you realize
that simply throwing around phrases and
words like, ’ “rape,” “molestation,” “strip-
ping down naked and raping...” is danger-
ous? By trivializing those words you have
most likely offended anyone who has ever
been affected by sexual assault.
Furthermore, you are mitigating the severi-
ty of such hostile actions 
Lastly, I ask you to remember the ﬁght
for student representation on the Board of
Tnistees back in February. The time and
energy invested in  lobbying the adminis-
tration to keep students on the [trustee]
committees  was not in vain. SGB  feels
as though students should be priority 
And while I applaud The Pitt News for
their initiative to hold the governing institu-
tions at Pitt accountable — rnisinforrnalion
is not appreciated.

Just a couple of
thoughts from
  a lonely guy

 

Some random thoughts from a
very random guy:

- The catchy tune goes a little
something like this:

“Giant Eagle, so simple for you,
fe fr fo fum, blah, blah, blah.”

If you live in or around Pittsburgh,
Giant Eagle is a way of life. Every kid
grows up loving the Steelers,‘ Pens,
Bucs, and his or her Advantage Card.

I have never worked in a grocery
store, therefore I am not l00—percent
qualified to judge just how exciting
and lavish working at the Dirty Bird
may be, but that could all change soon
for a 58-year-old clerk from nearby
Lower Burrell.

Charles Ireland entered a Gillette
sweepstakes at the store, and he will
be in Indianapolis this weekend with a
shot at winning $1 million.

The 6’3” former Etna High
School hoopster will battle two others
later this week for the right to knock
down the 3—pointer Saturday at the
Final Four.

“I’m Irish,” he said. “When I get
lucky, I get real lucky.”

Ireland plans to practice on his
backyard hoop built years ago, and he
doesn’t plan to get help from a coach.

Who said nice guys finish last?
Ireland is guaranteed at least $5,000,
and the trip to Indy for him and his
wife is all—expenses paid.

Not to be a cynic, but don’t be sur-
prised if some small print with the
words “employees are not eligible”
pops up.

Either way, good luck, Chuck.

in Atlanta put on a show for the whole

It’s time for the ”Stairwciy to Heaven” at the '97 Dance  

Kentucky-Minnesota

In the second game of Saturday’s Final
Four doubleheader, hoops fans nationwide
will see a much closer contest than antici-
pated. The Kentucky Wildcats will defend
their national title against the Golden
Gophers of Minnesota. While they match
up closely in the numbers department, only
Kentucky’s Head Coach Rick Pitino has
what it takes to lead his team to back-to-
back titles.

Here’s what to expect:

Frontcourt ,

Kentucky’s 6—foot—6 superstar sopho-
more forward Ron Mercer (18.3 ppg 5.3
rpg) will most likely be the focus of their
offense. Look for Minnesota’s big man, 6-
foot—9 junior center Sam Jacobson, to have
his hands full with Mercer, and with 6-foot-
9 sophomore forward Scott Padgett (34.2-
pct 3-pt fg), who is a threat underneath and
outside the basket. If Jacobson can get help
from 6-foot-7 sophomore forward
Courtney James (12 ppg, 6 rpg, 4 apg) it
may ease the burden of trying to contain
Mercer, a future NBA draft pick.

The Wildcats’ 6-foot—10 freshman cen-
ter Jamaal Magloire may be the Achilles
heel of Pitino’s front court. Although he
leads the team in blocks (75), he does not
have the experience to dominate the boards,
especially when matched up against the

Gophers’ senior center John Thomas. If the
6-foot—9 Thomas continues his outstanding
tournament play, prepare for a lot of bump-
ing and  and a lot of foul shots. For
both teams, the deciding factor may be
which trio can stay out of foul trouble, and
whether or not experience will play a role.
Backcourt

I might have to give the backcourt
edge to Minnesota for one reason, senior
guard Bobby Jackson. Jackson (16.1 ppg
6.7 rpg) is one of the hottest players in the
Land of 10,000 Lakes and the rest of the
country. If the Gophers hope to make it to
the biggest dance of all, Jackson not only
needs to be on, he needs to be in, around,
underneath, and in between the Wildcats’

Whether you like it or not, players and
coaches are not the only ones who can

their second national title in a row. And
with the genius of Rick Pitino, Minnesota
will have to play the best game of their

Former Cardinal set to run Pitt back to the top

 

Pitt football’s new assistant
coach for running backs, Vincent
White, knows what it takes to reha-
bilitate a slumping program.

White played" for Stanford as a
running back from 1979 to 1982. He
was recruited by two coaches who
later went on to coach in the NFL.
You may have heard of them: Bill
Walsh (49ers) and Dennis Green
(Vikings). He also played with one
of the greatest quarterbacks of all
time, John Elway. He led the nation
in receiving yardage as a running
back in his senior season at
Stanford.—

White was a sixth—round draft
pick of the New York Jets in 1983.
He chose instead to play for the
Denver Gold of the now-disbanded
USFL for two full seasons. His
coaching career began in an unex-
pected manner.

“I tore a rotator cuff, and that
ended my career in playing,” said
“There was a coach who
coached with us at Denver that I
became friends with while he was a
coach at Stanford. He got a job at
Oregon Tech, and I ended up going
with him there being his offensive
coordinator and running the run-
and—shoot offense.”

J SMU received the

White moved to Tennessee-
Martin in 1989 as their wide-
receivers coach. White first met Pitt
Head Coach Walt Harris when he
became the wide-receivers coach at
Pacific in 1990.

White spent three of the last
four seasons as wide—receivers

coach and academic liaison for

helped to create an environment
which allowed the players to enjoy
a degree of success not measured on
a statistics sheet.

“Every day I had a positive atti-
tude with those kids,” White said.
“That’s been my approach ever
since then  I think I became a bet-
ter coach because I was positive
every day.”

It didn’t take
much convincing
on Harris’ part to
get White to
become part of
the program.

“When Coach
Harris offered me
the job it was on

as a result of the the telephone,”

“But we tried at
SMU not to even
talk about that.
But if you go
back and look at
that place — the facilities, to the
way they run their academic pro-
grams —everything has been_totally
changed because of the death penal-
ty. And they’re still reeling from
that now.”

White is

respected by his
colleagues in the

lighted by the fact he was the first
coach hired by Harris. His work
ethic and discipline are noticed by
all those who work with White.
“Coach White is an outstanding
football coach,” said Jim Earle,

Pitt’s assistant athletic director for
football operations. “I think his
work ethic, his work habits, his dis-
cipline are probably the key to his
success. Not just as a football
coach, but with everything he’s
done. You don’t graduate from
Stanford in four years while playing
football unless you’ve got a great
work ethic.”

White sees a great deal of
potential among the players at Pitt
this season. Since the beginning of
spring practice, White has seen a
change in the team. ,

“I like to go to practice,” White
said. “It ﬂies by. We’re moving

-around. There’s some enthusiasm

out there, there’s some effort out
there. They might not execute it
perfectly, but they’re having fun out
there practicing and getting after
people.”

The motivation for White to
continue in coaching is probably his

' most telling characteristic, both as a

coach and as a person.

“You take some guys that are
just high-school kids, who don’t
really know, and you see them
mature and grow as they get older,”
White said. “I could care less about
[them getting to] pro football, just
as long as they graduate and get a
degree. There’s no question that’s
why I’m still coaching.”

Here’s a look at how they match up:
Frontcourt

Arizona’s front court of 6-foot-11 A.J.
Bramlett (8.5 ppg, 6.9 rpg), 6-foot-8
Bennett Davison (10.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg), and 6-
foot-5 Michael Dickerson (19.8 ppg, 4.5
rpg) are undersized compared to Carolina’s
7-foot-2 center, Serge Zwikker. Fortunately
for the Wildcats, though, Zwikker’s skills
are questionable (see also Shawn Bradley),
and Bramlett has done a ﬁne defensive job

in the tournament against the likes of

Kansas’ Scott Pollard.

. The Tarheels’ 6-foot-8 Antawn
Jamison (19.1 ppg, 9.4 rpg) will present dif-
ficulties for Arizona because of his athleti-
cism and in—your—face dunks that make him

 

Dick Vitale’s favorite sophomore.
Carolina’s other starting forward, 6-foot-8
Ademola Okulaja, will have problems
guarding the speedy Dickerson, who has a
considerable speed advantage which he’ll
exploit for fast-break baskets and double
teams on Jamison. Expect Dickerson to
score 20 points, his season average.

The biggest question of the game will
be if Davison can contain Jamison like he
did Providence’s power forwards, Austin
Croshere and Derek Brown, in the
Southeast finals. If not, expect Jamison to
score 15 to 20 points in the first half.

THE PIT NEWS

Mike Bibby (13.1 ppg, 5.3 apg) showed
basketball fans nationwide that they are the
only guards capable of outrunning Kansas’
J acque Vaughn, Inc., previously considered
the nation’s speediest backcourt.

But they’ll have to match up with
Carolina’s Vince Carter (12.8'ppg, 4.4 apg)
and 3-point standout Sharnrnond Williams
(14.4 ppg, 4.4 apg, 43 percent 3pt). Look
for North Carolina to make more passes
around the perimeter than usual, in hopes of
wearing out Arizona’s track team dressed in
basketball gear. In the end, though, the
Tarheels’ guards will be busy watching
Arizona run up and down ﬂoor with ease.

ed No. 2 Utah. To top it off, they beat North
Carolina by 11 points in the beginning of

the season, without the services of starting .

shooting guard Miles Simon.

Carolina has beefed up their inside
game since that November 22 encounter,
though Jamison can dominate a game if his
guards hit their threes, spreading the
defense out. Zwikker will need to make his
presence known early if Carolina is to con-
trol the paint.

Look for Carolina’s Dean Sn1ith—a-
thon to end in Indianapolis. Arizona has too
much steam for the Tarheels to keep up. My
prediction: Arizona 90, North Carolina 8].

John Iliffe, left in September, and now
their chief officer, Mal Hemmerling, is
gone.

The SOCOG announced that
Hemmerling left to “pursue other
career interests.” '

In Outback lingo, that stands for,
“I’m not going to be involved when
these games blow.”

but her highness has slithered past

Prosecutors have dropped the case
against Graf, and as a result she will

In making his movie Private Parts, radio leg-
end Howard Stern takes off his stereotype shock-
jock mask to reveal the face of a surprisingly inti-
mate and compassionate person. The movie mixes
many of his autobiography’s facets into single,
event-packed scenes and races through rather shal-
low character developments. Private Parts blurs
the line of truth enough to leave long—time, Stem-
leamed fans wondering who the real Stem is, but
convincing Stern virgins that he really is just a mis-
understood, sensitive guy.

Though Private Parts maintains a superﬁcial
air about it, the jockumentary lifts Stem’s trade-
mark sunglasses enough to peer beyond his radio
persona. Still, it remains a largely fan—geared ﬂick
with cameo appearances by several of the “Stem
Show” regulars.

His thrill of the hunt for the average —— or not-
so—average — person’s admiration is constantly
ﬂashed on—screen throughout the movie. Stern
goes so far as to actually state that he wants people
to “understand the man, not the myth,” and sets out
to prove that he does indeed grow on listeners like
a fungus.

The movie begins in his Roosevelt, N. J.,
hometown with a look at Stem’s rough—and-tumble
youth in the largely black community. He follows
his father to work at WHOM, a New York City
radio station, where he decides at an early age that
the wheels are in motion for what would eventual-
ly be a highly controversial radio career. The sec-
ond we see a young Stem turning a public puppet
show into a pornographic playset, the snowball of
shock begins its roll.

Following him through high school and col-
lege, Stem eventually meets up with the love of his
life, Alison (Mary McCormack). Their love breaks
out as fast as the pace of his present-day radio
show, and he begins his career at a Hartford radio
station, WCCC. Here the then-whiny-voiced DJ,
dudded out in full ‘70s style, fails in his ﬁrst shot at
radio success. He makes enough money in a man-
agerial position to marry Alison, but soon after
quits his job to pursue a DJ career.

As we follow his whirlwind on-air life
through Detroit, Washington, D.C., and ﬁnally his
long—time dream of New York City, Stem evolves
slowly but surely into the se1f—conﬁdent, self-pro
claimed “King of All Media.”

Along the way, Stern is teamed up with his A

present-day partners of Fred Norris, Robin
Quivers, and the legendary Jackie “the Joke Man”
Martling, who are all played by themselves.

Fred Nonis, Stem’s sound-effects wizard, is a
nearly mute tagalong throughout the movie. From
the beginning, the viewer is shown a reclusive,
ominous guy with an uncanny knack for imper-
sonations and sound mixing. Stern is forced to
leave Norris as he moves on, but later sends for him
from his developing D.C. shock show.

Quivers enters Stem’s radio scene just as he
begins to create his Washington airwave empire.
Private Parts offers a fair development of her on-
air chemistry with the radio sensation. But the
movie skims the surface of the characters’ conﬂicts
and developments to make room for as much
shock material as possible in the two hours of
screen time.

Martling shows up in one of the radio-show
scenes after his move to WNBC in New York City,
and the plot runs on, dragging the rest of the Stem
east along, expecting the audience to already know

Howard Stem has forever changed the
face of autobiographies with the creation of
his book, Private Parts (paperback ——
Simon & Schuster, Inc. $7.50) His 657-
page debut into the world of written media
does a better job of revealing what’s really
behind the bad boy of radio than anything
else on the market today.

Exploitation is what Stern does best,
and in “Private Parts,” he deﬁnitely exploits
the luxury of print to detail an unprecedent-
ed description of his life.

What makes “Private Parts” so easy to
swallow is Stem’s skillful insertion of inter-
esting vignettes throughout the text. The
book is cleverly punctuated by short anec-
dotes and quotes written by his wife,
coworkers, or whoever else Stem happens
to be writing about at the moment.

 

THE MOVIE

three years since the book saw print.

it Media,” so we thought we should too.)

 

Stem’s autobiography is loaded with
dozens of photos. In many cases, the bor-
derline burlesque photos of his behind the
scene antics speak more than 1,000 words.

Stern also slips in mountains of repro
duced hate mail, reviews, and documents
that give the bestseller a real scrapbook—type
feeling.

Naturally, Stem starts the book with a
story risque enough to scare off the faint of
heart and it sets the mood for readers in seek
of his trademark shock. From page one, cut-
ting through his I8 chapters of Stem history
is a breeze.

After a short introduction, Stern
plunges into his childhood and begins a
graphic no-holds—barred picture of growing
up as a white minority in Roosevelt, NJ.
Here the reader gets a detailed look at his
parents, his schooling, and the neurotic
over—protective world he always claims to
have come from.

Along the way, he’s candid and arnus—
ing in revealing much of his sexual past ——
including a brief homosexual encounter in
his youth — as a disappointment.

Like ﬂipping through the Stem family
album, the elaborate description of the more
traumatic events in his youth put the story
into context and allow the reader to see the
whole picture of Stem’s story.

Occasionally breaking from the
straight narrative, Stem cleverly cuts
between his past and the present to discuss
an issue without disnrpting the ﬂow of the
book. More than once, for example, does
Stem bridge a story about his “three-sec-
ond” sexual endurance in college to a simi-
lar story in the present day.

After his sexually-barren Boston
University underclassman years, Stem
ﬁnally meets Alison, the love of his life and
future wife. “Private Parts” offers an excep-
tional and very personal look of what

makes, and almost breaks, Stem’s 2(}some-year
marriage.

Moving from city to city zmd station to station,
Stem takes readers with him every step of the way.
Slowly, Stem describes the events that set into
motion his stylistic revolution and decision to pursue
a format that ﬁts his unconventionality. He insight-
fully relates his experiences and relentless marital
support to readers as honestly as his radio show is
shocking.

From Israeli radio station managers who tell
Stem he’ll never make it as a disk jockey to the pow-
erful producers at WNBC, Stem’s narration is enter-
taining. His use of abrmdant dialog and decent
description lift the cast of Stem’s life oﬁ” the page.

At the point where Stem has established his
New York radio empire, “Private Parts” subtly
becomes more like a diary than a narrative. Stern
begins to insert chapters dedicated to topics on
which he’s become somewhat of an expert on dur-
ing his radio career.

In one chapter, entitled “Celebrity True
Confession,” Stem relates some of the more inter-
esting stories of famous people he knows.

His stories about such celebs as Joan Rivers,
Bob Hope, and Jessica Hahn are as candid and
revealing as his own. Famous ﬁgures who have
spilled their guts to Stem may have made a mistake,
because this chapter is long and very revealing.

In other chapters, Stem humors readers with
his uninhibited thoughts on US foreign policy, our
European neighbors, and other matters, often with
offensive answers.

One chapter focuses his character creation:
Fartman. Stern details the entire concept-through-
creation of the pot—bellied, spandex-suited, and bare-
assed superhero who ﬁghts for freedom with his
powerful ﬂatulence.

Stem spends a decent—sized section cataloging
the many members of his radio show "Whack Pack"
— a gmup of infrequent regulars whose bizarre acts

have made them part of the Howard Stern show’s
history. Here, people such as Vinnie Mazzeo —- a
man who set his testicles on fire to be on Stem’s
show —— and Rachel the Spanker — famous for her
ability to smoke a cigarette in a highly unique and
unusual manner —— are detailed by the self—pro-
claimed “King of All Media.”

Stem writes about everything — from his heat-
ed wars with other prominent entertainers to a chap-
ter detailing the embarrassing interviews by
Stuttering John Melendez, the Howard Stern Show
intem—tumed-entertainer.

Reflecting on everything from his grandfather
—— who Stem said he considers to be his sexual guru
—— to his “uncontrollable habit” of masturbation, the
raunchy radio jock delivers a hefty load of tongue-
in—cheek tales. Unusual and borderline voyeuristic
stories keep curious readers turning the pages.

The latest reprint of the paperback edition
includes an additional chapter.

Stem claims he added the extra chapter,

a good deal about them. From that point on, his
radio team members fit into underdeveloped and
awkward movie roles.

As Stem‘s characteristic deep voice of
invective emerges, the ratings wars with compet-
ing jocks and battles with managerial bureaucra-
cy become hotter and harder. Stem spices up the
movie with some of the titillating (and sometimes
tasteless) talent that listeners have come to expect
from him.

The movie places Stem’s wife Alison on a
pedestal, and her devotion to him, despite his out-
going and racy personality, makes for the single
thread of dramatic unity throughout the movie.
Often criticized and questioned by people for her
marriage and devotion to Stem, she ﬁnally
receives the public respect she deserves from the
man who more than once pushed the envelope
far beyond the holding strength of most ordinary
marriages — including an on—air ridiculing of her
miscarriage. In Private Parts, we deﬁnitely see a
side of Stem that he has never before revealed.

 

 

Stem offers some scenes that are touching but
never very emotionally charged.

Nevertheless, there are things that even
Howard Stern wouldn’t sell for $7 a pop, and that
includes an unﬁltered examination of himself.
Though funny enough to justify a movie ticket,
Private Parts doesn’t sufficiently answer the
question of who Stern really is.

Private Pants shows once and for all that
Howard Stern holds nothing sacred. It also shows
that everyone, at some point or another, hates him
and what he does. But Private Parts conﬁrms
that in turning away, most everyone comes back
stronger than before, making his foes, as well as
his fans, interested in listening to his program just
to hear what will happen next.

The look of the movie is just as entertaining.
The Ivan Reitrnan production incorporates odd
angles that subtly and subconsciously take the
viewer into a Stem—like mind. Translucent
images of angry producers and other characters
can often be seen in the engineering-room win-
dow while the camera focuses on a scene of the

Hardcore Festival
Thompkins Square Riot Gathering
March 28-29 at CM U Drill Deck

CMU hosts a two-day hardcore festival
this weekend. Twenty-eight bands will.be
playing. So here’s a handy time Chart to help
you sort your life out. No one could possibly
give all the bands their well—deserved sup-
port, but try to check out as many as you
can. A musical gathering of this magnitude
is a rare thing; with DIY bands, it’s better
than Lollapalooza; and with hardcore, it’s
cheaper, too: $6 lets you check out Friday’s
bands, $9 dollars for Saturday, and $10 for
both days! Do the math.

I guess some band banter is in order.
Locals Shale and Jumbo are both awesome.
Moloch are also from Pittsburgh and I’m
sure they rock too.

Franklin, from Philadelphia, is rad, as
you probably know by now. But check out
the weird, hour-long Moloch set before
theirs. Rumor has it that the elusive Atom:
the sequencing man may be on hand. This
scheduling inconsistency may be prophetic
of his appearance. Atom often plays with
Franklin running his sequencer through
their gear either before or after their set.
With only himself and his sequencer, Atom
makes poppy little jams. You may notice
some songs from your favorite bands in his
set. You may also wonder why he makes
light of them. But don’t take it personal; he
doesn’t “like any band,” including yours.

Besides, being a one-man band and poking
fun at songs that some people hold sacred is
pretty damn hardcore. Some love him, some
can’t even stand him. But have a sense of
humor, because maybe we can expect him to
show up somewhere during Moloch’s gen-
erously allotted time slot.

Braid puts out some melodic stuff with
an emotional feel. F rodus is heavy as hell.
Ethyl Meserve come from State College and
are also a great band. Good thing we don’t
have to deal with any lame town rivalry in

this supportive musical environment. Trivial -

rivalries seem to generate a lot of hoopla
and may attract more people, but who needs
those people?

Education

Various political discussions will also
‘be going on Saturday. So when you feel the
need to get away for a while, check out
some of these educational forums. They
shouldn't be too far from where the bands
are playing. -

The two-day festival will beneﬁt the
CMU Substance-Free Organization. The
organization helps the growth of all positive
social and political groups on the CMU
campus. Funds will help toward future edu-
cational and musical events at CMU.

Thanks goes out to Nathan, who helped
compile much of the information in this arti-
cle.

Book

“because my editor convinced me that the people
who bought the hardcover will msh out and but
this new edition if there are a few more pages.”

__ In the added section, Stem throws 63 pages
of both beneﬁtting and boycotting reviews made
after the ﬁrst release of “Private Parts.”

Any person with a sense of humor — and a
shred of humility —— will ﬁnd themselves howl-
ing through most of this easy read’s pages and
may ﬁnd themselves putting it down more than
once to take a breather from laughing.

“Private Parts” is Stem at his best — which
many may consider his worst. His candid, Lenny
Bruce—like approach to life in America touches a
nerve in everyone at Sonic point, but also man-
ages to soothe the pain with laughter.

For the ﬁrst time ever, Howard Stern
explains clearly and comprehensively the man
behind the shock-jock console. His philosophy is
shown with exceptional clarity as Stern talks to
— and not down to — book readers.

The book is written with his radio and TV
show fans in mind. For fairs, “Private Parts” is the
complete encyclopedia of Stem. It provides any-
one who has ever wondered about the story
behind one of Stem’s jocular jabs an inlet to the
radio shows jokes.

Stern stands beside, not behind, the First
Amendment, and his book is a searing testament
to that.

“Private Parts” is not for the easily offended.
Following in the spirit of his radio shock jock
image, Stem takes every opportunity to talk about
sex, lesbians, deviants, and other offensive mat-
ters with every ounce of his “discriminating”
taste.

Howard Stem has shown the ability to

mom PAGE 19

 

make it in yet another medium, which doesn’t ’

come as any surprise.

From start to ﬁnish, “Private Parts” is pure
mental masturbation — and I’m not ashamed to
say thatl thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.

Now, with the Stern movie out of the
way, a look at three ”serious" films...

When We Were Kings
Directed by Leon Gast

Phat irony. That’s how it is with
Leon Gast’s Oscar-winning documen-
tary When We Were Kings. Gast and his
talking heads make much of Ali’s hero
status among the people of Zaire (where
this “Rumble in the Jungle” was held in
1974), and Ali, Don King, and a few
other brothers wax [poetic about this
being a return to Africa and a celebration
of blackness. Peace, brotherhood, self-
respect, and self-knowledge — all the
usual hype and rhetoric punctuated by
Ali, time and again leading Zaireans in
cheers of  Bomaye,” which trans-
lates to “Ali, kill him,” referring to his
opponent in the Rumble, fellow African-
American George Foreman. Real broth-
erly, ain’t it.

See, big George wasn’t the lovable,
cheeseburger-eatin’ mufﬂer salesman
you see today. Pre-Rumble, Mr.
Foreman was a true badass. He flicked
up Frazier good and made Kenny Norton
cry, while both those guys had previous-
ly beaten Ali. So the matchup of a nasty
25-year-old Foreman and a 32-year-old
Ali, who appeared to be only half the
ﬁghter who beat Sonny Liston 10 years
earlier, looked like a blowout But that’s
why Ali is Ali: the world’s most recog-
nizable athlete of all time had come to do
the impossible.

Gast originally came to Kinshasha,

Zaire to film what Don King and music
promoter Stuart Levine wanted to call
the “black Woodstock," a musical gath-
ering of black performers both American
and African big enough to draw world-
wide attention, and provide a prelude to
the ﬁght. Music and footage from James
Brown’s performance provides the
soundtrack for an extended montage in
one of the ﬁlm’s hottest moments. Gast
captures the heat and sexual energy of
the crowd of natives and foreigners
packed together and seeking release
from the anticipation of the delayed ﬁght.
This footage gets woven into the ﬁlm
nicely and creates a feeling for the size
and scope of the event itself.

While ﬁlming the concert, Gast
sent cameras to follow the ﬁghters
around, catch Don King spouting bull-
shit of Biblical proportions, and get
footage of the impoverished dictatorship
that was and still is Zaire. This is where
the irony comes through constantly and
often, it seems, unintentionally.

Besides “Ali, kill  we hear the
Greatest speak of the need for black men
to respect their women and families. Ali
gets off the plane with his official wife,
after we’ve seen him in training camp
with his mistress. The women inAli’s life
get progressively lighter-skinned as time
goes on —— a thomy hypocrisy I’ll
respectfully skip commenting on, though
I would’ve enjoyed hearing a black
woman’s take on all this. Especially after

James Brown chimes in on the ‘black is
beautiful thing’ while sitting around with
King and Co., then proceeds to get off the
plane with his white girlfriend. Too bad
the only African-American Gast uses as
a 20-years—later commentator is Spike
Lee. And even at that, Lee only gets. a
few quick snippets.

Speaking of talking heads, the near-
ly unbearable Norman Mailer (who’s
always a fervent supporter of any latent
homosexual activity) goes on and on
about the mythical proportions of this
ﬁght. In many ways, the Rumble was

' truly an amazing drama, but a huge laugh

comes when the ﬁlm shows, full screen,
a black-and-white photo taken the
moment Ali knocks Foreman out. We
see Mailer and George Plirnpton, per-
haps the whitest white guy on the planet,
with eyes bugged and mouths agape in
shock at what they thought was impossi-
ble.

Perhaps the most ironic moment is
a montage sequence near the ﬁlm’s end.
The corny, supposedly uplifting music of
the title song, “When We Were Kings”
tries to tie the ﬁlm’s events into a positive
package, while another montage of pho-
tos and footage ﬂies across the screen. In
the midst of “togethemess” lyrics, stills
of punches thrown and heads in mid-
snap — moments of undeniably obvious
and incongruous not-togethemess —
produce another strangely amusing

moment in the ﬁlm.

With all this in mind, maybe When Were Kings
fails to be convincing with its feel good efforts but
succeeds in doing what a documentary should do:
show events and people in all their problematic
ambiguity, revealing in the end that even the extra-
ordinary folks like Ali are full of human failings.
I’m not sure I want to give Leon Gast total credit for
this, but his ﬁlm ends up doing it beautifully.

Crash
Directed by David Cronenberg

"With James Spader and Holly Hunter

With all the controversy surrounding the
release of Crash, David Cronenberg’s latest sojourn
into the realm of human depravity, naturally I was
curious to check it out. It seems Her Majesty’s
Royal Censorship Committee ﬁnally decided that
the ﬁlm is not too gnarly to be seen in England, but
it may not be shown to minors, as is also the case
here in the States (the last country, incidentally, for
theﬁlmtobere1easedin).Ihavereadacoupleof
reviews (the Post—Gazette’s one-star rating being
among the most superﬁcial readings of the ﬁlm) and
some interviews with the always-eloquent
Cronenberg. I was prepared for pretty much any-
thing, and I’ll admitl was alittle grippedbythepre-
release hype before I paid my $6.50 Sunday night.
Iwon’tsaythatIwishIhadgonetosee When We
WereKings instead,butIwil1saythatIalmost
wished I had. by the ﬁ1m’s (ﬁnal) climax.

From the beginning, Cronenberg has been
obsessed with the concept of transformation and
mutation of the human body, and the relationship
between such transformations and the nature of
institutionalized (medical, societal, or otherwise)
control. From Rabid (starring pom queen Marilyn
Chambers) and I/ideodmme through the bigger-
budget ﬁlms The Fly and Dead Ringers, this theme
has pervaded his work. Sometimes the results are
amazing (see The Brood, one ofthe greatest honor
ﬂicks ever), sometimes they are a bit more dull
(Dead Ringers). Either way, Cronenberg’s ﬁlms are
always intelligent and worth the viewing.
Unfortunately, much of Crash falls into the latter,
duller category.

I still liked the ﬁlm; it reminded me more of his
earlier ﬂicks than his more recent ones. I think the
actors all had a ﬁrm grip on what their characters
were all about. which is not too much at all. They
are desensitized. and need to experience pain in
order to feel pleasure.

Crash is chock full of sex. yes, but it is not
quite as mindless as the P-G would have you think.
There were some interesting ideas going on in this
adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s “unﬁlmable” 1973
novel. Once again, Cronenberg has mariaged to
mold the spirit and intent of an author (as he bril-
liantly handled translating VV1lliam S. Burroughs’s
even more unﬁlmable. nonlinear novel “Naked
Lunch” into ﬁlm) with some of the same thematics
that he’s been exploring in his ﬁlms all along. The
thing is, he barely scratches the surface of what I
would consider to be the central idea behind the
ﬁlm: that of a “reshaping of the human body by
modem technology.” Instead, he offers us some
sexy shots of crash victim Arquette wearing a mesh
body stocking beneath her leg braces. some cool
driving scenes, and a whole bunch of fucking.

Those who protest the bleakness of
Cronenberg’s vision simply need to either get a clue
about the meaning of art, or else go check out Liar,
Liar instead. This guy is a true auteur. and he has
never abandoned his particular obsessions, even
when he managed to pull a candy-coated hit ﬂick
out of them, as he did with The Fly. This movie is
dark as hell, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
holding too much hope for the future. Cronenberg
and Ballard may feel that there is some sort of lib-
eration inherent in their characters’ existential
embracing of their own mortality, but it doesn’t
exactly come through that way in this ﬁlm. I guess
the idea is that only in facing death, can we truly

appreciate life. Hence the fact that the characters in
Crash morbidly ﬂock to re-enactments of famous
car crashes like the one that killed James Dean.
They caress each other’s scar tissue in the heat of
sexual passion. Only in the ﬁlm’s ﬁnal, truly dis-
turbing scene, do we begin to see any real compas-
sion between the characters.

If you can handle it Crash is deﬁnitely worth
the watch. I just wish Cronenberg would have run
with the philosophical ball a little further, instead of
reducing his ﬁlm to a series of predictable sexual
couplings (“o.k., now the two girls are gonna do it
 o.k., now it’s the guys’  etc). I don’t think his
basic premise, that of people getting turned on by
car crashes, is tenibly shocking or unrealistic. I
think the real problem that most Crash—bashers
have with the ﬁlm is that they refuse to accept that
this stuff already happens, which it deﬁnitely does.
David Cronenberg does not glorify or romanticize
any of the sex or the car crashes. He simply gives us
a slightly skewed look at the world we already live
in, which is a pretty terrifying place to be.

Donnie Brasco
Directed by Mike Newell
With Al Pacino and Johnny Depp

Donnie Brasco is probably the bleakest ﬁlm
that has been .made since The Deer Hunter. If that
means nothing to you, then let’s just say that this
rnoviehasnohappyending,andintheend,noone
walks away a winner. But that’s the point which
makes this movie perfect for all of you who prefer
torootfortheundendogratherthanbetonthestne
thing.
Thefocushereistheacting.JohnnyDeppand
Al Pacino deliver some of their ﬁnest performances,
and the supporting cast. including Michael Madsen,
the infamous Mr. Blonde front Reservoir Dogs,
give performances equal to Depp and Pacino.

The purpose of this ﬁlm is show you those
people that are chewed up and spit out by the orga-
nizations which they pledge their lives and alle-
giance to.

So, the plot is not one full of twists and turns.
Instead, the movie is a character study, that shows
how different kinds of people react when placed in
extreme situations.

In this ﬁlm, we get to see Al Pacino play a
character, Lefty, who is the antithesis of Michael
Corleone. Rather than being the clear—headed mob
boss with nerves of steel. he plays a jittery hanger-
on to a mob culture that he will never be able to get

ahead in. His is the tale of a man standing on the out— ~

skirts, watching the kids that he brought into the
family pass him by.

At first, Lefty is painted as a wheeler/dealer in
the mob. We see him through the eyes of the feds
and Donnie Brasco. lefty takes Brasco under his
wing, and in the stance of a mentor, teaches Brasco
how to move up in the mob.

As Lefty, Pacino exudes a weariness and
weakness that will not be seen in his earlier mob
films, The Godfather and Scarface. In fact, he is
closer to the Dustin Hoffman character Ratso Rizzo
from Midnight Cowboy. He’s the type of guy who
dreams of going to someplace warm, saves up his
pennies, then dies en route.

Depp as Donnie Brasco is not much better off.
He starts out as a young, idealistic FBI agent. His
innocence soon fades as he goes deeper and deeper
into mob life only to find that the FBI isn’t the pro-
tective organization he thought it was, and that the
mobster lefty takes care of him better than the Feds.

Perhaps the moral is that friendship is where
you find it.

The true beauty in this movie is its grit. It cel-
ebrates those people who are more likely to fall
through the cracks than save the world. It might be
dreary, but it’s a pleasing change of pace to spend an
evening with the people most would like to pretend
don’t exist.

Miss Dessa
Directed by Eileen J. Morris
Kuntu Repertory Theater

The Black American theater possibly has its
most famous roots in great plays like “Blues for
Mister Charlie” and “The Amen Comer” by James
Baldwin. The current discourse conceming the
Black American theater also includes classics by
writers such as Baraka, Shange, Wilson, probably
hits a high note with Pitt’s own Rob Penny, and is
somewhere in an uplifting syncopated rhythm with
Shirley M. Hardy—Leonard. Hardy-Leonard wrote
Kuntu Rep.’s latest, “Miss Dessa”, which closes out
Kuntu’s season of “A Celebration of Women."
“Miss Dessa” is a story, as is indicated in the direc-
tors notes. about L.O.V.E. Although it gets a little
trite at times. or even a bit pretentious, the show
allinns that love is really what makes the world go
around. ‘

Miss Dessa (Karla Washington) is a single,
middle-aged schoolteacher in Chicago who has a
son about to graduate from high school and two sis-
ters, one sexually explicit and the other hypocriti-
cally pious. Althea (Chanel Smith), the sexually
explicit one, is married to a hard-working house-

, painter, Buddy (Morin Washington). Althea, Buddy.

Dessa, and Dessa’s son, Gene (Esrick O.
McCartha), all live in the same house with Amanda,
the hypocritically pious sister visiting once in a
while. Dessa is getting older and cares about educa-
tion and knowledge and noble things and isn’t nec-
essarily looking for a husband. But, enter John
(Franklin Westbrooks), a strong, good—looking
steelworker looking for love, into the picture and
the story starts to get interesting. The play then goes
into a complex exploration of relationships between
Dessa. her sisters, her son, and her possible beau.
Hardyleonard has won several awards for
playwriting, many from the NAACP, as well as a
Chicago Emmy for Channel 5 in Chicago. “Miss
Dessa” will be rewritten as a screen play by Hardy-
Leonard within this year. Eileen J. Moms, who was
invited by Dr. Vemell Lillie, took some time off
from her post as artistic director of the Ensemble
Theater in Houston to direct the show. Morris has
appeared in JFK. the film. and won awards for her

' work in “Two Trains Running” and ‘The Piano

Lesson."

With all these accolades on the company‘s
shoulders, one would expect a pretty solid show. A
solid show is what I saw, as Hardy-Leonard has
written a story that engaged me and most of the
audience for most of the evening. If it can be com-
pared to an uplifting, syncopated rhythm, the story
went up and down, the characters bounced off each
other; at the end of the show I felt pretty good.
Although at one point the show drags the audience
into anticipatory torture with the “sisters—getting—

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

v

drunk" scene, “Miss Dessa” is written well enough
to make me laugh and thoughtful enough to portray
a realistic story that transcended overplayed stereo-
types by showing simply the kinds of things that
people go through. V

Esrick O. McCartha was blazing and dancing
with energy as Eugene Wamette and maintained
interesting situations with Karla Washington’s
Dessa. The overall energy of the show was enough
to draw me into the world created. Chanel Smith’s
enticing Althea was sizzling and dynamic; Franklin
Westbrook’s John Fortney was strong with focus,
and his trumpeteering was especially engrossing.
Yet again, I have to mention energy and more ener-
gy as Linda Hunt’s Amanda was alive with passion
but at times became overcome with a stasis of pre-
dictabality. I enjoyed Monn Washington as Buddy
Long as he interestingly countered his spunky wife,
Chanel. The company was strong and. as a self—pro—
fessed lover of James Baldwin, the play displayed a
likable “Amen Comer” feeling of togetherness and

repartee, something that can only be achieved by"

strong actors.

With shows like "Plyin’ West,” “Boppin’ Vlfrth
the Ancestors,” and “Traces,” Kuntu has shown that
they are committed to quality black theater. “Miss
Dessa” stays consistent with the notion of quality by
incorporating a talented cast to perform a pretty
fuckin’ good show.

Miss Dessa runs tonight thm April 5, 1997 in the
Masonic Temple Auditorium, across from the
Cathedral of Learning, 4227 F iﬁh Ave. Shows run
Tuesday thru Saturday at 8 p.m., and Sunday mati-
nees are at 4 p.m.. General tickets are $12, $8 for
students.

Pitt Theaters Workshop Production for the
semester previews tonight and opens this weekend.
Karel Capek, a Slovakian playwright of the early
20th century, wrote “R.U.R.” which stands for
Rossunfs Universal’s Robots. It’s a show about
robots and how technology can potentially fuck
things up. It should at least bring out those disap-
pointed postmodemists who attended the Sokal-
Aronowitz debate last week; maybe something
about science and its pomo and metaphysical fac-
tors will actually be discussed. “R.U.R.” is being
directed by Ph.D. student Gwen Orel, of
Unidentiﬁed Human Remains and the True Nature
of Love fame, and stars ﬁrst—year M.F.A. Bryan
Gill, Tim Wisniewski, Sarah Morgan Peters, et al.

R. U.R. previews this evening at 8 p.m. at the Studio
Theater, basement of the Cathedral of Learning.
Tickets are $6. The show opens tomorrow night at
8:00 and runs through April 5, with all perfor-
mances at 8 p.m. and a 2 p. m. Sunday matinee.

morning masters of the airwaves forging their
trademark impromptu skits.

Ironically. “Stem Show” producer Gary Dell’
Abate makes cameos only during several scenes
inserted throughout the movie to signal another
Stem exodus to a new city and a new station. Dell
‘Abate unfortunately never enters the plot because
the movie ends somewhere in the late ‘80s with
Stern still at WNBC. Dell ‘Abate’s scenes are
packed with thonged women, transvestite men.
stripping housewives, and even a donkey —— all
holding name cards for the new city and being
prodded by the relentless Dell’ Abate. These jump
scenes are funny and characteristic of the “Howard
Stem Show.”

Humorous commentaries are inserted
throughout by Stem’s wife, his mother, and an old
producer. These all help the viewer to puncture
Stem‘s mysterious bubble enough to shed at least
some light on what Stem wants his audience to see
of him. Private Parts doesn’t spin on the
“Howard Stem Show"; rather, it spins on Howard

 

Stem. Devout fans may be upset not to see more of
the regular show members at some point during the

two-hour ﬂick. Crackhead Bob, the Kielbasa ‘

Queen, and Stuttering John Melendez — all Stem
regulars, but mainly introduced in the ‘90s ~— pop
up for only several moments into the ﬁlm in Stem’s
attempt to leave room for a sequel. By leaving
enough space for a follow-up, Stem loses impact
by leaving the viewers stuck in the 80s.

The movie neglects to show‘ Stem’s ﬁnal
move to K-Rock (formerly his father’s station,
WHOM) in New York City, where he still main-
tains his throne of radio raunch. He has come along
way since his ﬁrst great success and, neglecting the
larger half of the last decade, misleads those who
don’t know much about Stern and cripples his
movie’s punch. While Howard Stem may be a
modem-day Lenny Bruce, Private Parts is no
Lenny . The gush Stern has received in the
Hollywood scene is still deserved.

Replete with lesbians, big breasts, sexual
innuendo, and bigotry, Private Parts is a relatively
soft introduction to those who know nothing about
him, a decent satisfaction for long-time fans, and
more fuel for enemies’ frustrations.
