Pitt researchers to start testing new anti-AIDS drug

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

Pitt has been chosen as one of
45 testing sites for a new anti-
AIDS drug, and is expecting over
2,500 nationally recruited subjects
to take part in the study, which
will begin in approximately one
month. ‘

' “[Pitt] is one of the 45 clinical
trial groups around the nation,”
said Cindy Zagiebogylo, Project
Coordinator for the Pitt Treatment
Evaluation Unit.

The drug, dideoxyinosine, or
ddI will be made widely and
readily available while the
effectiveness and safety testing is

still in progress. “This is the first
time in the history of drug-testing
trials where the drug is on an
expanded release system,” said
Zagiebogylo.

Dideoxyinosine will be tested
head-to—head with the drug
zidovudine, or AZT. A list of 70
people who are interested in
being involved in the procedures
has been released.

AZT ' has been reported to
cause anemia (reduction in red
blood cell count) in its users.
Although ddl does not seem to
cause anemia, many of its side
effects are still unknown. ’

Officials at the Public Health
Service, a division that includes
the FDA and National Institutes

of Health, are calling the concept
of availability a “parallel track,”
meaning that a drug would be
made available to people with
AIDS in clinical trials as well as to
people who are unable to
participate in the trials.

Pitt’s testing plan will also make
the ddI drug available to those
people who cannot take the AZT
drug because it is too toxic. “The
drug will either be used by itself
or in conjunction with AZT, ” said
Zagiebogylo.

Of the three stages involved in
the drug-testing process, the first
one is a test—tube phase. During
this phase, blood is taken from
subjects and is tested with the
drug in a test—tube environment.

The second stage is referred to
as Phase I. It involves a small
group of people who fully
understand the risk of a new drug
and are kept under close
supervision for side effects.

The third stage is called Phase
II-Phase III and involves a larger
group of people beingitested.
These people are also closely
watched. Phase I results have led
to an observation of subjects
complaining of pain in their feet
as well as their hands during
Phase II—Phase III.

“The fact that AIDS is such a‘

critical disease is helping to speed
up the process of the [three]
phases,” said Zagiebogylo.

For those who are unable to

use the AZT drug, ddl is currently
available to them through their
private physicians. “Right now
there is [no other type of drug] for
these people,” said Zagiebogylo.
“They need to be using
something.”

Pitt’s Treatment Evaluation
Center is funded by The National
Institute of Health. The University
has been involved
research since 1986.

In addition, the Pittsburgh AIDS
Center for Treatment, which is a
joint program of Pitt and
Presbyterian Hospital, offers
clinical services to those infected
by the AIDS virus.

The new volunteer program at
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
offers Pitt students another
opportunity to become involved
in the work of the nationally
recognized clinical research center.

In 1984, PCI was established by
the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Mellon University, and
six hospitals associated with the
Medical and Health Care Division
at Pitt.

In August of this year, the
institute began a volunteer

wgram, which is open to students
he university. The duties of

se volunteers will range from
guiding tours for national and
guests to

her Resident Assistants in honor of "Bosses Day," in the Towers Cafeteria yesterday.

Students to work at cancer institute

comforting patients and their
families along with a wide variety
of other duties, according to Amy
Webber, the coordinator of
Volunteer Services at PCI.

She said, “I would like to
welcome» the students of the
University of Pittsburgh to join this
new program.”

Twenty—three members of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity have
already signed up for volunteer
service. Webber said, “I am looking
forward to having the members of
SAE join the volunteer program.”
However, more volunteers are
needed. She encourages the
participation of all interested Pitt
students.

In addition to volunteer work at
PCI, Pitt students are involved in
several other levels of service. Ray

Felgar, a student at Pitt who is
presently studying for his Ph.D.,

is working with several other

students as a,research assistant.
His work under Dr. Hiserodt,
who recently received the
President’s Research Award,
involves studying innovative
cancer-fighting approaches
known as biological response
modiﬁers. He said, “We are
looking at ways to alter the
immune system to fight cancer
cells in culture and in animals.”
He believes the most interesting
aspect of his work at PCI “is being
confronted with new problems
and having to solve them knowing
that they may lead to better
therapy for cancer patients.”

. Crowds cause ’rninor

problems’ at games

Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

College football games often
seem to evoke images of
drunken maniacs and violent
fights.

But according to Walt Waters,
first assistant director of public
safety, the troubles the Campus
Police encounter are “basically
minor problems.”

Although there have only
been two home games, Waters
believes that student conduct
is “somewhat better,” than
previous years.

“We try to have two city
officers or Pitt police in each
section; that way we can react
to the problem quickly and
keep it under control,” said
Waters.

One problem they do have
is the drinking of alcohol at
games. i

“We try to control the alcohol
by conﬁscating it at the gates,
but of course some gets past
us. I don’t mean to say it’s all
the students either,” said
Waters.

Another problem that Waters
does anticipate is fans throwing
objects onto the ﬁeld, although
he did say that they haven’t
had a problem with that yet.

“I’ve heard about things like
batteries being thrown at
professional games, I hope
that’s not a trend.”

Waters also noted that the
violence at the games has also
seemed to be minor.

“We have an occasional fight,
but we’ve been rather
fortunate,” said Waters.

“Another problem we’ve had
through the years is car thefts
and break-ins. We started
sending [unmarked] cars

around the area. That problem
has seemed to decrease too,”
said Waters.

Overall, Waters is not too‘
worried about the behavior of
Pitt students during the games,
and added that there hasn’t

‘been a problem with fans

from the opposing teams.

The real problem, according
to Pat Scanlon of the South
Oakland Citizens Council, is
the exceptional number of
parties before and after the
games.

“The citizens of Oakland
want to welcome the students
as an [intricate] part of the
community, but we want them
to behave properly, as if their
parents lived [across] the street
from them,” said Scanlon.

Scanlon doesn’t expect the
students not to party, but said,
“We urge people to party
responsibly; the community
deserves that. We don’t really
mind a few hours of loud
music,ibut it’s the after-party

behavior that is a problem.

We're sick of these people
crapping on porches, urinating
in our yards, and saying that
they’re going to rape our
daughters.”

Another problem that
businesses complain about is
people hanging around in
Oakland after the games.

“Night games can especially
present a problem, because it
puts more people in the Forbes
[Avenue], Bouquet [Street]
area,” said Waters.

“We will hold a lot of the
ofﬁcers over after the game
until we see what the situation
is like. Then we start to send
them home if there is no real
nrnhlem ” Waters said.

International Living Unit offers cultural exchange   _‘

Byjenifer Crook ‘
Staff Writer

An empty bottle of Bacardi
sits on the window shelf beside‘
a table strewn with physics books
and notes that Pitt senior Ajay

Patel is mulling over. His suite, —

1-1E Bruce Hall, that he shares
with three roommates, looks just
like any other campus housing
facility with colorful posters
neatly covering the graying walls.

But there’s something that

separates Ajay and the others on V

his floor from most Pitt students.
For one, the posters are written
in different languages; and on
one living room wall two ﬂags

hang side-by—side _— not the

standard stars and stripes — but

. the green and red ﬂags of India

and Malawi, a central African
country that Ajay moved‘ from
three years ago to attend Pitt.
Ajay is one of the foreign
students that live in Pitt’s
International Living Unit located
on Bruce Hall’s 11th ﬂoor.
Established by Pitt in 1978 to

help international students better I —

adjust to college life, the ILU
ideally houses a 50-50 mixture
of foreign. and American
students in its 51 places. This
year, according to Joan Lucas,
an adviser to foreign students
with the office of International
Services, there are slightly more
foreign than American

undergraduates‘ in the V unit I
’ coming to Pitt from such diverse I
— countries as Syria, Japan, Korea,

Iraq, Switzerland, Germany and J

England.

For the foreign students, living I
in the international unit makes .

their adaptation into American
culture "a little easier.

“You get to helplieachother

out. Americans already” know
their way of life, butlforeilgners

:7, don’t know American culture

right away. And you don’t really
know any other foreigners at
first. But when you move into
the International Living Unit, half
of the people are foreigners also,
so you get to explore the new
culture in a group. It’s very
helpful,” Patel said.

“It’s a lot of fun up here,” said
Matt Cadi, a freshman originally
from France. “We just talk
informally sometimes about our
different religions, values and

 traditions.“ You get to hear

everyone’s life stories. But we’ve
all become prettyAmen'canized.”
Ajay’s cousin Avi Patel, who
came to Pitt from India, said,
“You’re kind of forced to bind
together. I learn a lot from them,
and they learn a lot from me.”
“It’s not a fraternity, but in a
lot of ways we all hang out
together like one,” Cadi said.
While they feel "that living
together with other international
studentshelps them out at Pitt,
all of the students interviewed
agreed that it’s important they
also make and keep friendships
with Americans.
“At first I thought living here
hindered my assimilation into

::i)’itt. I wanted to live in the

Towers because I wanted to
‘experience’ American culture,”
said Philippine-bom sophomore

Publio Briones. “But after a
while, I made friends with the
people up here and realized I
have the best of both worlds. I
made friends with people in my
classes, and I got to know these
guys and learn about their
cultures. But Ican’t see myself
hanging around on this ﬂoor all
the time. What’s the use of going
to school in the States and
hanging around with foreigners
all the time?"

“I still have my American
friends. You just have to learn
how to balance your life and
meet “people,” Avi Patel said.

Cadi said, “When you get here’,
you don't get to meet too many
Americans if you just stick around
this ﬂoor although there are
some living here.” ' A

Vi Morgano is an American

4 who waslplaced in the ILU by

the housing office the second

semester of her freshman year.

Now a junior, Morgano has kept
living there by choice.
“I didn’teven know this ﬂoor

existed befofe I got placed on

, it,” she said. “But I’m glad I was

placed here. Everyone gets along
so well; we all know each other’s

business. Everyone helps each

other out. p x
“You find out about so many
people's cultures. You learn

about all these countries that -

you’ve heard of but may never
get to go to,” she added.
“People always’ ask me ‘why
do you want to live with all the
foreigners?’ and it’s really hard

, to explain. I just like it up here,”

said Morgano’s roommate
Stephanie Roth, who chose to
live in the ILU this year. “I’m
getting an extra education
outside of the classroom.”
Paula Knezevich, resident
assistant for the ILU, said she

sees the advantages it offers

Pitt’s foreign students.

“I think the way it’s set up is
very helpful because there are
Americans up there. If it [were]

‘just international students, it

would defeat the purpose. But

they get the chance to interact
with Americans as well as with
each other,” said Knezevich.

“I was kind of nervous about I

being in charge of the ILU
because I knew there might be

some problems. At first, we did»

have some communication

problems because not all the

residents can speak ﬂuent
English. But so far, things are
great. Their floor has a lot of
energy, they like to do a lot of
things together,” added
Knezevich.,

Jointly sponsored by the Office
of Residence Life and the Office.
of International ‘Services, ILU

residents are selected by an I

application process and are
required to write an essay at the
end of the year describing their
experiences, Lucas said. The
residents also participate in many
group activities “throughout the
year, such as a January open
house for the public to come up
and see what they’re all about;

“What we’re really aiming for

iscampus awareness. Sometime
in the future we want toexpand;

the number of ‘applicants is '

increasing each year. As of yet,
we aren't big enough to take in
everyone that applies, but we
hope to be in the future,” she
said. I ,
“It’s a tight-knit group,” said
Lucas. “During diversity week,
the residents have a ‘hotel party,’
where each room has food,
money and different symbols
from all different countries. Many
of them are also active in the Pitt
International Student
Organization, and they play
intramural sports and do other
activities together.” . _
Lucas added I‘ that anyone»
interested in the ILU. should
attend the January open house
and contact the office of

Abortion inﬂation?

It appears that every bill before Congress these days

concerns abortion.

V The newly proposed Abortion Control Act of 1989»calls
for a 24-hour waiting period, bans all abortions after 24
weeks of pregnancy, requires a woman to inform her
spouse of her intended abortion and prohibits sex-

selection abortions.

This current addition to the clutter of bills on Congress’

desk would ultimately mean an increase in the cost of

abortions, mainly because of the proposed waiting period
which requires a doctor to orally inform.-a woman of the

possible hazards 24 hours before she has an abortion. ’

Since this is unlikelyto change anyone’s mind (most
women already.know the potential hazards before mak-

” /ping such a decision), the price hike would serve no other

purpose than to allow the doctors to become a little richer.
“Wealthy women will always be able to ‘get safe
abortions,” stated Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, executive
directorgof Planned Parenthood. “It’s the lives and families
of poor women that will be hurt the most.”
So, in essence, the bill would promote discrimination

‘ against poor women. If the price of having an abortion

were to go up, a woman without the money to pay for a

_ safe, legal abortion would have limited options. She could

have a ‘‘back alley” abortion that would be neither safe

nor legal, or she would be forced to have a baby thatshe B

cannot afford — pregnancy tends to ‘be very expensive,
that is, if she even cares enough about the baby she is
being forced to have to take propercare of herself.
Thus, a bill that would make it next to impossible for any
woman to have an abortion is a step in the wrong
direction. The right to choose should not depend on the

size of on_e’s pocketbook.

District Eight includes North
Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill,
Friendship and a small portion of
Point Breeze. North Oakland is a

key part of this area. People in‘

Pittsburgh, typically do not vote
in vast numbers, and neither do
university students around the
country. Thus, one wouldn't

‘ expect a great voter turnout from

Pitt students who live in North
Oakland. If the students do have
a “good turnout, however, they
could really affect which direc-
tion the campaign ‘takes. In light
of the fact that it takes about 10
minutes. to vote, there is little or
no reason for all eligible Pitt
student voters not to express their
right to vote. , ' '
There are some important is-
‘ sues that affect Pitt students such
as the parking ‘problems in
Shadyside and Oakland, city wage
taxes, taxes on small businesses
andthe drug problem. The two
candidates certainly know that
students could be the difference
in the election, so some students
can expect to be contacted by

passively sit by and let others
define us for us is helping in the
unconscious and conscious plan
to destroy the culture of the Black

\ THE prrr NEWS, Tuesday,’Octobe1-17, 1989

Soviet-Alien relations improve

There’s‘ been a decent amount
of media attention in the past
week over a UFO sighting in the
Soviet Union. Some of the re-
porting has been serious, but
most has been sarcastic. The

Soviet news agency T ass reported "

that tall, extraterrestrial creatures
with little knobby heads landed
in a park in the Russian city of
Voronezh. Personally, I’m quite
skeptical. Not because I deny the
possibility of alien life visiting
Earth, but my doubts surface
when I consider the irrationality
of their choice of country to visit.
Of all the beautiful, eventful and
cheerful places on the ‘Earth,
why would intelligent alien life
(or any type of life for that mat-

 

Vter) choose the Soviet Union?
Let’s assume that the aliens
actually landed and, for the sake

V of sensationalism, that they met?

with Gorbachev. Also, we should
assume that the aliens, being so
intelligent and technologically
C advanced to travel such vast dis-
tances, have been intimatelv I
monitoring life on earth very
closely for a long time — with
expert eyes. Picture the conver-
sation: ‘ C .
“Welcome, com-

age?” , .

Aliens: “Greetings. Actually, we
had trouble -pinpointing the So-
viet ‘Union. Our navigational
equipment was deceived by all
the Soviet military equipment and
advisers in Afghanistan — we

almost accidentally landed there

instead. Nevertheless, we come
in peace.” V I’
Gorbachev: “And I offer, peace.“

_ In fact, I keep offering arms re-

duction proposals here on earth, .
but President Bush keeps reject-

ing them!”

Aliens: “Bull. Bush offered the
conventional arms forces reduc-
tions to achieve parity between

I’ the Warsaw Pact and NATO. You

offered shady, asymmetrical
missile reductions that would only
benefit your side.”

Gorbachev (realizing he had
underestimated their intelli-
gence): “Hey Yuri, get those damn
cameras and -microphones outta

here. (Yuri: “Sure, Boss.”) Maybe

so, friends; but everybody loves
me anyway —— I’m a great guy.
Ask the Washington Post. Ask the
West Germans, I have a 93 per-
cent approval rating in that pros-
perous country!”

Aliens: “The West Germans are
among the same idiots that first
loved Hitler and started WWII.”
Gorbachev: “Enough of this bick-
ering, cornrades. Why have you
come to this ‘workers’ paradise?”
Aliens: “We wanted to thank you
for the fuel we -borrowed‘ a few
years back.”

Gorbachev: “Fuel?”

Aliens: “Yes, from that nuclear

explosion‘ at Chernobyl —‘ it»

helped get‘ us back to An-
V dromeda.” : ‘
Gorbachev: “Ho, ho, "ho —- that
little spill?”
Aliens: “Little spill — we're still
using it!”
Gorbachev: “Well, what might
you give. me in return?”
Aliens: “What do you want?”
Gorbachev: “How about if you
make sure that the US. doesn’t
build an -anti—rnissile defense
system?” '
Aliens: “You /don’t need our help
there. The U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives‘ already hastaken care
of that. ”v T ‘

Gorbachev: “True. Well, how

- about if we have some -dinner

and thinkit over? A little bread
and water maybe? — sorry, but
there’s nosbutter‘.”~

Aliens: “No thanks. We don’t have
the time to wait in line for six

hours.“
Gorbachev (scratching his
splotch): “Well then, let me think
— I know -—- how about $14
billion in hard currency to fi-
nance our external hard currency
debt?’{
Aliens (laughing facetiously):
“Won’t perestroika take care ,of
that problem?”
Gorbachev: “Just between me
and you guys: I’m not letting
perestroika go far enough and
therefore it’s failing, but it does

, make great headlines in the US!”
Aliens: “We’ll think about it. We
might be back.”

Gorbachev: “Do you have enough I

a room on your aircraft to take the
people of the Baltic states with
you? They’re really becoming a
big headache and I might have to

. pull a “Tiananmen Square” to
stop them from protesting — and

that would be bad for my public ,’

relations campaign and great
image in The New Yorle Times. If
not them, then how‘ about Cas-
tro? I can’t afford him anymore!”
Aliens: “Those are your prob-
lems, pal," not ours.”

Actually, this imaginary con-
versation‘ could have the mak-
ings of ’a great modern-day

American sitcom: it’s stupid and I

non-believable. It could‘ be the
pilot for _a classic sci-fi series -
maybe we could call it “My Fa-
vorite Russian” or “Flash Gor-

'g bachev‘.”/ A movie sequel would

be easy: a frustrated Gorbachev,
upset with the arrogance of his
alien visitors, “mistakes” their \

aircraft for a Korean airliner and A ,

shoots it down —— maybe we
could call it “The Evil Empire
Strikes Back,” opposite Ronald
Reagan- In the spirit of glasnost

and for the sake of his P.R. cam- .

paign, I think Gorbachev should
jump at this opportunity.

Bush is keeping up with tradition

Alright, I don’t want to hear
anymore George Bush cracks. If
his performance at last Friday’s
press conference doesn’t extin-
guish all of your doubts concern-
ing his presidential prowess,
you ‘re hopeless! Mr. Bush ducked,
dodged and diverted every ques-

_ tion as well as any sharp-witted

 

politician.

In particular, his answerto the
ﬁasco that will surely become
known as Norie-gate proved he
can B.S. the American people
with the best of them. The ques-
tion posed was this: after all the
clamor, pomp and circumstance

QML Bush has been spewing out

about wanting Panamanian dic-
tator Gen. Manuel Noriega ousted

from his office, isn’t it a contra-
diction for him to have “wimped
out” (no pun intended) when the
opportunity arose? Sly George
replied that no, it wasn’t. Al-
though he Wanted Noriega out, it
did not imply a carie blcmche on
his part to allow force in any

given situation."Now Who could _

better draw attention away from
an issue as serious as this by
tossing in a cute phrase like carte
blancbefthan our very own be-
loved Mr. Bush? Ignore the fact
thathe wouldn’t have bad to use
force since Noriega was already
in captivity. Clever, Mr. Bush.

When asked why he wouldn't
allow federal  to be allo-
cated to help poor victims of

. incest or rape ﬁnance an abor-

tion, although he permits those
victims who are ﬁnancially able
to afford them to do so, he cir-

cumvavigated the topic, saying ,

he had no intention of changing
his position on’the issue. ‘When

askedto clarify his position, he
said that everybody ,knows what
his position is —— because ithasn’t
changed. He’s taking advantage
of the fact that nobody paid
enough» attention to his bold and
clear standpoint when he leaked
it to the public. We were all still
starstruck with that “thousand
points of light” bit. Very clever,
indeed, Mr. Bush. '

And, when the reporters started
to get restless," he put to use the
po1itician’s greatest tool, the
“important meeting” that started
five minutes ago. Which meeting
is that, Mr. Bush? Oh — the really
important one! a

Good answer.

Yes, Mr. Bush has got it all
together all right. And,’ you were

This friend is Respect, and

Respect plays a very impor-

And not only .has Respect

I am asking for others to ac-

The more ‘people that are
devoted to finding Respect,
the better our chances are that
we will be able to convince
him to come out of hiding. In

In the past few months, there
has been quite a bit of contro-

‘The liberals argue that they do .

their view would be a clear vio-

lation of the rights that the First V

Amendment guarantees. They
also assert that it is wrong for the
government to determine what is
art and what isn’t. I agree with
this 100 percent. I fully support
free speech and would not want
the government to interfere with
it in any way.

On the other hand, conserva-

tives state that they do not want u

they consider to be obscene art.
Without even stating what con-

with this 100 percent. ’

‘ So, wait a minute. How can I
believe in two conflicting state-
ments? Actually, these statements
are not conﬂicting at all. The
truth is that the government never
pays for anything; the taxpayers
do. Every one of us is forced to
pay taxes.

The government should imme-

lowered accordingly. This way,

Thus, everyone should be free _ _

to produce any type of art that

about?

Pizza Contest to benefitjllarc/9ofDz'meS F1001‘

By Toni Crary
For The Pitt News

Pizza is the word of the week
as the ﬁfth annual Best Pizza in

Town contest kicks off to benefit
the March of Dimes. One hundred

and forty pizza shops in‘ the‘

Pittsburgh area are competing
for. recognition as the area’s prime

The contest, sponsored by B-

194. ..FM, Coca—Cola and the
' Pennsylvania Macaroni Company,

is_ hoping to raise $10,000 to aid

the Pittsburgh chapter of the

March of Dimes. ‘
“We raised $8,000 the last time

we did this, but we're stretching-

our goal this year to $10,000,”

. said Michelle Frennier, director

of the event.

Businesses will collect votes of
25 cents, with the top 10 “vote-
getters” competing at the Grand
Taste-off on Nov. 19 at the

Galleria. Celebrity guests and food
experts will select a winner who
will be recognized as the area's

Sports Editor

Lots of amazing, new and strange things
happened in the world of sports this
weekend. Here are the leftover notes:

0 The biggest news — Wayne Gretzky
broke Gordie Howe’s NHL scoring record
that stood for over 10 years. Gretzky now
has 1,852 points in just over 10 years (780
games). Howejscored 1,850 points in his
26 NHL years (1,767 games). It’s only
ﬁtting that Gretzky broke the record in
Edmonton, where he scored most of his
points while playingwith the Oilers —- not
hard to ‘see why he’s called “The Great
One.”

0 Howe was considering coming back
to play hockey in the NHL again to play in
a record sixth decade. He dropped it,
thank God. I can understand him wanting
to get the record, but at 60+ years old, he
obviously isn’t good enough to play in the
NHL again. Why should a team make an
exception and let him on the team just so
he can be personally satisﬁed and break a
record. Sure he gavea lot to the sport, but
if he (or anybody) is not good enough to
contribute, why play? Maybe Jim Brown

needed

will consider playing in the NFL again. Oh.
yeah, he did that already. ,

0 Speaking of hockey, the Penguins (2-
2-1) are three games out of first place in
the Patrick Division. The N.Y. Rangers (4-
1) are on top with eight points. Mario
Lernieux scored on Sunday, breaking his

personal four-game goalless streak. They ,_

lost the game, however, 4-2 to the first
place Rangers. They ‘

so far, and they’ve been doing it ‘with

unlikely heroes. Neither Mark McGuire ‘

nor Jose Canseco have hit the long ball

yet, but “power men” Walt Weiss and

Terry Steinbach have provided the dingers.
The series goes across town to Candlestick
Park today for game three.

- The Pitt Panthers had 13 penalties in

their 31-14 win on Saturday against Navy,

the most penalties

beat Montreal 2-1 in
overtime on ‘Saturday.
The Pens take on the
Toronto Maple Leafs

 

against Pitt since they
had 14 against Rutgers
last year. Pitt is
averaging" almost
eight penalties a game

tonight at the Civic
Arena. ’

The Pens have scored just 17 points in
their four games; only two teams have
scored less. With all the high scoring
threats the Penguins have, they should be
among the leaders. They are one of the
best teams in the league, and if they want
to be serious contenders for the Stanley
Cup, their scorers have to startdoing what
they do best.

0 Shifting gears to baseball, or bays ball
as it’s called at this point, Oakland looks
determined not to lose their second straight
World Series. They have a 2-0 game lead

that win to stay

Brister didn’t play the second

: this year.

0 Pitt proved that they have two great
tailbacks in Curvin Richards and Adam
Walker. Richards saw limited time against
Navy but still had 66 yards on just four
carries. Walker ﬁlled in more than
adequately for Richards as he gained 105
yards. Walker only saw limited time before
the Temple game. If only Pitt could get
those two in a game together or utilize
their talents more than they have.

0 The Steelers beat the Browns on
Sunday, proving they are impossible to
ﬁgure out. They looked like a Little Gridder

team the first two games but looked like a
good pro team the last four. Other teams
impossible to ﬁgure out because they look
like a Super Bowl team one week and a
cellar dweller the next: Indianapolis, Tampa

Bay, LA'Raiders and Buffalo. No, not the ‘

Lions, because they ﬁnally won. They are
still terrible, despite having Rodney Peete.
- Herschel Walker had a successful

’ debut for the Vikings. His 148 yards rushing
in a 26-14 win over Green Bay were the

most by anyone in the NFL on Sunday. He

adds a running game to the sfloundearingl

Viking offense, something they-*'haven’t

"had in years. Last week the Vikings leading . 

rusher was Rick Penney, who had
thirtysomething. Walker and the Viking
defense are going to be hard tobeat this
year. ‘a

0 The 1989 football debut for Bojackson
was also a success. He had 85 yards on 1 1
carries and a touchdown.

0 One more note — Tony Dorsett’s
NCAA rushing record was broken by Texas
A&I’s Johnny Bailey on Saturday. Bailey
had 172 yards rushing against Central
State giving him a career total of 6,085.
Dorsett’s record set from 1973 to 1976 was
6,082 yards.

The real Pittsburgh Steelers
showed up at Cleveland Stadium
on Sunday, the ones that slapped
the Browns 17-7 in a ﬁt of revenge,
not the ones that were publicly
executed 51-0 by the same
Browns five weeks ago.

Or were they?

The talk around Pittsburgh prior
to the most recent contest was
that the “real” Steelers were going
to show up for the game in
Cleveland, not the irnposters that
bungled around on the Three

time, so the “real” Steelers must’ve
showed up this time. Nice of
them to do so, right. The team

competitive in that sardine can
known as the AFC Central.

Well, I don't buy it.

What if I came up with the
bizarre notion that the men in
black and gold that won 17-7
were the very same football
players that lost by half—a-
hundred?

Crazy? Indeed. But to continue
to capture the attention of the
fine readers of this fine
newspaper, somebody has to
come up with the silly concepts
and cornball comparisons that
have been known to fill the spaces
between the advertisements.

Sooo, they were the same
Pittsburgh Steelers.

Okay, so quarterback Bubby

time around. Neither did guard
Craig Wolﬂey. RB Tim Worley
and CB Rod Woodson, two of the
team’s more talented players; they
were knocked out of commission
early in the first quarter. Wide
receiver Louis Lipps screwed up
his hamstring late in the second
quarter and wasn’t much of a
factor.

But aside from those minor
inconveniences, Pittsburgh pretty
much ﬁelded the same team.

Let’s start with the game’s
external variables, for
completeness’ sake and to set the
mood: Both contests started at
4:00 EST. Gametime temperatures
were exactly 81 degrees at kickoff

Lady Panthers successful against Mid-American

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Lady Panther volleyball team
themselves temporary
members of the Mid-American
Conference last weekend as they
traveled to battle permanent
members ‘Bowling Green State
and Western Michigan. ‘

The trip was successful as the

1 Lady Panthers won both ma_tches
and improved their record to 15-

4.

Pitt arrived in Bowling Green

on Friday not knowing what to; -

expect against the Falcons. As a

result, the Falcons took the Lady

but

Panthers to five games (15-13, 6-
15, 5-15, 15-13, 15-9) in a match
that lasted two hours and 15
minutes. i

A “That was not one _of our better
matches, ” said Pitt head coach
Sue Woodstra. “We hit a .108 [kill
percentage], and we had 41 hitting

' errors.”

“Bowling Green played great
defense! It seemed like they dug
out all the balls that we hit over,”
Woodstra said.

Pitt trailed 9-4 in the last game
but started a comeback that was
sparked by a substitution mistake.
“I put Heather Hollands in one
rotation early; she had to play the

Hollands blocked three balls in
a row up front for points, and the
team picked up momentum and
the last 1 1! points to win the

} match.

Pitt arrived in Kalamazoo, Mich.,
Saturday evening thinking they
would be in for another tough
match against Western Michigan.
Pitt had beaten the Broncos less
than a month earlier at a

tournament at Notre Dame, but

the match went to five games.
Pitt had an easy time of it as
they took this one in three games,
(15—9, 15-10, 15-8). i

[from the last time we played
them], and the team handled it
well,” Woodstra said. “The games
were _closer than they look; it was
tight at 9-9 and 10-10, but we
took off from there.”

“We didn’t make a lot of errors;
we had only one time where we
lost three points if in a row,”
Woodstra said. A 5

A race /oome- ,.

built car
snaﬂonaﬂy

By Rob Codispot
For The Pitt News

A group of eleven Pitt‘

mechanical engineering students
designed, built and raced a Grand
Prix-styled

race car earlier this year as a
senior project.

The Pitt car finished 4th out
of 11 first—year competitors in the
annual Formula Society of
Automotive Engineers _ (SAE)
Competition held this past May
23-26 in San Antonio, Texas. Pitt
finished 21st out of 36 in the
overall standings. ‘

Pitt’s car, whose builders are
members of Pitt’s student chapter

‘ of (SAE), was built with a 60-inch

wheelbase and has a 48-inch track

width. The car is powered by a 4- 8

cylinder, air-cooled 600cc
Yamaha engine. Steering is
controlled by a custom fabricated
rack and pinion unit. The car has
4-wheel independent suspension
with outboard ‘ mounted disc
brakes in the front and inboard
mounted disc brakes in the back.
The fiberglass body, fabricated to
cover the chassis and driver, was
painted blue with a yellow Pitt
logo adorning the front.

The car, which cost.$8000 to
build, was sponsored by General
Motors, Mobay, PPG Industries
and the . Pitt mechanical
engineering department. It was
designed and finished in only 9
months, with construction taking
place in the sub-basement of
Benedum Hall. According to Pitt
SAE President Scott Pardi,
constru ction was more than just a

A 9-to-5 ‘job.

“Whenever we were working

on the car after finals were over,”,

Pardi said, “we were working
days at a time without sleeping.

= We went 40 hours straight one

time.
“You build ninety percent of

A the car and it’s the last ten percent

that kills you,” added designer

‘£9

Dave Sisca. “It took three weeks I

[to finish the car] before we left
for Texas and it was like all "night
getting everything right.”

Well, not quite everything.
Designing and building the car
‘took so much time that the
engineers were unable to run
any kind of testing on it.

“We were out the day before
we were supposed to leave
behind Benedum,” Pardi said,
“and our president last year took
off down [O’Hara Street], turned
the wheel’ and broke‘ the steering
column. That was the extent of
our testing.” ‘

And so they were off to Texas

their car would run properly.
‘We went to Texas the day

‘before [the competition] and we

were still unsure as to whether
everything was right,” SAE
secretary Ed Morgan said. “We
got down there and still had
things to conquer.”

Conquering the engineering
and performance events wasthe
task at hand for each school at
the SAE competition. Schools
were awarded points for car
design and sales presentation in
the engineering portion of the
competition. The cars’
performance was judged in
acceleration, fuel economy, skid

ipad, manueverability and

endurance tests.
And. when the engineers

"weren’t competing, they were

spending their timein the machine
shop working on the car.

“The big challenge,” Morgan
said, “was getting the things that
broke on us fixed in time for the
next event.”

The race received national
coverage from On Track
magazine. ‘

“[On Tracks article] said
something about some school’s
cars not making their first turn
until they made it to Texas, that
there was a lack of testing," Pardi
said. “That was us.”

_ Pardi and the rest of SAE’s

’ J members plan toenter next year’s

competition in Detroit, Michigan.
Competition rules prohibit
school’s from entering the same
car two years in a row and plans
have already been made for

\. modifications to the geometry,

chassis suspension and engine of
the car as well as building a new
body. 0 V

“[The car] will look a lot better
next year,” Pardi said. “We're
hoping to do better, too.”

in each. Eerily enough, the winds

were were 10 mph right out of
the Southwest.

This is how a rematch should
be played, under comparable
circumstances. Now the cold, hard
statistical facts that should really
spell this one out: '

-The Steelers longest run from
scrimmage in game one was 12
yards; the team’s longest in the
rematch was 13.

-Steeler passers threw for 10
completions in game one; Steeler
passers threw for 10 completions

’ in the rematch (yes, Rodney Carter

is must be considered a passer
since he threw one off the
halfback option, and yes, Todd
Blackledge is considered as a
passer merely because he plays
the quarterback position).

-The Steeler defense gave up

16 completions to Browns
quarterback Bernie Kosar in game
one; it conceded just 15 inthe
rematch.

-Defensive end Aaron Jones

A made his tackle of 1989 in game

one; Jones had a brilliant stop of
the Browns’ Eric Metcalf, just
moments after, the airborne
running back had sprung into the
end zone for a touchdown in the

rematch. (Granted, a bit of a

reach onthat one.)

oLipp‘s had one reception in
both games.

-Kosar was denied a
touchdown pass in both games.

-Cleveland was forced to punt
five times in game one, six times
in the rematch.
the dramatic

So why

turnaround, you ask?

Consider this invaluable data
collected from each game onthe
all-revealing “Which foot is the
shoe on this time?” statistic, for
the key lies within:

y-Pittsburgh gave up eight

turnovers in game one; Cleveland A

had seven in the rematch.

-The first scores in both

contests were scored by the-

winning team and were the direct
result of turnovers.

-In game one, Brister, the losing
home quarterback, completed a
batted down pass to himself for a
loss of 10 yards; in the rematch,
Kosar, the losing home
quarterback completed a batted

‘ down pass to himself for a lossof ,

seven yards.

0 Brister threw three

interceptions in game one; Kosar
threw 4 in game two.

oIn each game, the winning
punter placed two, punts inside
the opponents 20-yard line, while
the losing teams only placed one
—— a semi-telling statistic as far as

field position goes. Believe me. .

-The winning teams held a

time of possession advantage of
over 10 minutes in each game.

That spells it all out —— for as
poorly as the Browns and Bernie
Kosar played, they deserved what
they got.

As for the Steelers, they ran

0 the same conservative offense, '
played the same Rod Rust defense, ’

and this time got all the breaks
when there were breaks to get.

And sometimes that is the ,0

luckiest break of all. .

injury was more serious. He is On

crutches, and it is doubtful that
he will play in Wednesday’s game.

Regardless of the injuries, the
Panthers were able to hang on
against the Wildcats. Villanova
pressured the Panthers in the
second half, scoring with 15
minutes remaining in the game.

The Panthers’ record is now 6-
4-2 (1-2 in the Big East) after last
week’s games.

Last Wednesday against
Carnegie Mellon, the Panthers
allowed a goal with eight minutes
remaining in the second half to
tie 2-2.

CMU defender John Stivoric
scored off a set play. He slipped
past the Panther defensive wall
and headed a pass from Chris
Kasabach. Panther goalkeeperjay
Kapusta was able to get a hand
on the ball, but it found the net.

“I think we had the wall set
right [on the set play],” said co-
captain Sam Lanza. “We've had
trouble all year on those set plays.
We didn’t stay with our men.
[Coach] Joel keeps harping on it,
and we keep screwing it up.”

CMU took a H) lead 15 minutes
into the‘ game when J. R.
Vakubisiov took a shot from the
right side off Steve Gardner’s
throw-in and beat Kapusta.

Both Panther goals were scored

by freshman forward Huy T ran.

Both of T ran’s goals were
scored on headers. The first goal

came with 10 minutes to go in the
first half. Co-captain Mike Blatz
took a corner kick and found
Tran in front of the goal.

“Blatz gave me a good ball, and

I got into space, and there was no .

one marking me,” said Tran.

T ran’s second goal came with
18 minutes left in the second half
to give Pitt a 2-1 lead. Pak made
a crossing pass to Tran who
headed the ball over CMU keeper
Glenn Hoogerwolf and into the
net.

“Heinz made a nice pass; they
just left me unmarked,” said Tran.

The two goals against CMU
completed a string of four goals
in three games for Tran.

“lCoach Luxbach/er] wants me
up there [at the forward position]
for my speed,” said Tran.

Lanza, who broke his nose in
practice two weeks ago, was hit
in the face by a ball and received
a bloody nose. He had to leave
the game but returned and’ said
the broken nose has not affected
his game. _

The Panthers have five games
left in the season with one Big
East game against St. John’s at

home next Saturday at 1:30 pm.’

Luxbacher said the Panthers
may still have an outside chance
at making the Big East playoffs at
the end of the season. The Big
East invites the four top teams in
the conference to its playoffs at
the University of Connecticut.
