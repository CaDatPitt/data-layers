Room Shortage
Still. Affects
Pitt Students

“A shortage of apartments for
married students is our greatest
worry,” William F. Saalbach, as-
sistant to the dean of men, and
head of the University Housing
bureau, stated yesterday.

Summarizing the s u c c e s s ful
program of housing single men,
Saalbach continued, “We have a
list of 408 available single rooms,
we have six
rooms that can be had in exchange
for work.”« Saalbach added that
in addition, he has 27 rooms avail-
able for negro students.

Saalbach‘ also pointed out that

there is still a backlog of 133 re-
quests for apartments which are
needed to accommodate Pitt’s
married students.
— For single men who are dissat-
isﬁed with their rooms in outlying
areas, the housing bureau can
sometimes arrange for rooms in
Squirrel Hill, East Liberty and a
few in Oakland.

For_the married students, the
bureau has record of two apart-
ments which are vacant because

of five houses that are for sale.
Neither the apartments nor the
houses, however, were considered
desirable in view of the prices
asked. ‘ ‘

“The success already achieved
by the bureau has been largely
the result of an intensive housing
campaign,” Mr. Saalbach con-
cluded. .A canvas was conducted
of “everyone who had ever offered
apartments or rooms to Pitt stu-
dents, advertisements were placed
in city and local papers and wide
publicity was given the campaign
through newspaper and radio.

The apartment waiting list re-
vealed that of the 300 couples who
originally applied, only 133 are
still in search of apartments.

YMCA To Mail Cards .
To Local Churches

Names and addresses of more
than 13,000 Pitt. students will be
mailed by the YMCA to 50
churches in the vicinity of the
campus before November 15.

Churches will then contact the
Pitt students who are living tem-
porarily in Pittsburgh.

In the 1945-46 school year, from
a total of 7100 students, 777 had
no religious preference, two were
undecided, one.a Hindu and an-
other a-Sikh. '

Jewish students numbered 960
while 5358 were Christians. Of
the Christians, 3284 were Protest-
ant and 2074 were Catholic.

1946-47 Registration  
Nearing 20,000

Registrar J. G. Quick predicts that 20,000 will be the com- ~
plete total for 1946-47 registration at the University of Pitts-5
burgh. This is 2000 more than the original estimate. 

Counting the 3,432 summer students who did not re—regis-
ter this fall, the grand total, since July 1, already has reached
18,726. When the fall ﬁgures are complete and the new Feb--
ruary registrants are added, the year 9s total will come to 20,000. jj

 
 
    
     
    
        
      

 

 
 
   
     
        
     
     
    
     
    
   

The announcement
Registrar’s: Olﬁce stated, “The
number of students now register-
ed at the University of Pittsburgh
is far in excess not only of any
previous comparable total but al-
so of any ﬁnal semester count
on record.”

At the close of the first day of
classes, September 23, the com-
bined total in the undergraduate
and graduate day and evening
classes was 13,084. This compared
with 7,375, the ﬁnal registration
ﬁgure for this group registered by
November 1, 1945.

The undergraduate day group
of 8001 ‘compares with the ﬁnal
count of 3157 last year. In 1945
there were 163 graduate day stu-
dents; this year there are 660. The
afternoon, evening, and Saturday
group now includes 4423, an in-
crease over last year’s total of
4005. -

When the 1310 students enroll-
ed in the professional schools and
the 844 registered in the Johns-
town Center are added, the total
for the present semester will
reach 15.284. Oi’ these 8531 are
veterans.

The_ . combined - undergraduate
freshman class in the College and
th e Schools of Engineering,
Mines, and Business Administra-
tion, is 3795. Of that group, 1447
new students are enrolled for the
first time for the regular fresh-
man programs.

 In the opening days of the

stands has been proud of the
showing of our young, inexper-
ienced, but nevertheless eager
and ambitious, team in the
games against Illinois, West

Virginia, Notre Dame, and
Temple.
A Our band, aided by a

‘$10,000 shot in the arm, has
been restored to its pre-war
‘stature and has thrilled every-
one with the strains of “Hail
to,Pitt” and with the intrica-
-cies and cleverness of its ma-
neuvers.

, However, there is one dis-
cordant note. The Pitt Panther
has appeared in its old, bat-
tered and moth-eaten outﬁt.
Certainly this can not be per-
mitted to go on. The Panther

:‘a ragged eyesore.

Pooaﬂdc/sect‘   /km.‘/ae In

1946 season it has been clearly

demonstrated that the University_ of Pittsburgh is on the way
‘backas a football power. Every Pitt man and woman in the

“WI” //I W \‘4‘/

always‘ has been one of the most colorful attractions at our
games. When it appears at contests away from home, it evokes
much favorable comment by the spectators. Indeed, it has in-
spired ‘many of our rivals to imitations.

(As an example the following is reprinted from the Daily
Athenaeum, student newspaper at West Virginia University-:
‘-‘Seeing the “Panther” riding his bicycle in Pitt Stadium last
week made us wonder when the traditional “Mountaineer”
will put in an appearance. No one seems to know. The “Moun-
taineer” is as much a part of the show a-s the band. . . ”)

P We,don’t know how much a new Panther skin would
cost, but it is obvious thatwe need one to maintain the pres-
tige of the fellow of the funny antics. The sum could "be
‘raised very easily through a » dance or a series of small
tea dances sponsored by Student congress.

. Like the many of our returning servicemen, our Panther
needs a new suit of c1othes—and badly——to complete the bright
new football picture of post-war Pitt.

source of pride to all of us rather than permit it to continue

I was reading the -paper when m’ lil cousin—-I call her that
because she is my cousin. She is only four-and a half years old
-—well, anyway, she, in’ lil cousin, burst in the locked door of my
room. Actually, the door wasn’t locked. If it, the door to my
room, had been locked, she couldn’t have burst in.

“Whatcha doin’?” says she‘, “Oh, just reading the‘ paper,” says
I. “Why?” says she. “To see what it says,” says I. “It don’t say
nothin”” sas she. “ . . . . ,” says I. What could I-say?—I was
reading the Pitt News. '

And so, that is what convinced me that I should inform
you about something. That which follows is the result. This

it should certainly provide a. waste of time for these who aren’t
interested. ' «

And now-—How to write a theme: The ﬁrst step, it seems is to
sit down and—-—think. No, don’t go yet, it gets easier. Of course, you
won’t be able to think of anything. Your mind will be a blank, if
you are normal. This is a natural situation which probably won’t
bother you particularly; however, the true student at this point
will begin to think about-what he was thinking about when he wasn’t

thinking about anything-——and he will take notesion it. The finished’

product will be approximately 1000 words of nothing. Call it “What
I Do When I’m Not Doing Anything” and have Major N. English,
one of those Five-Dollar scholars, organize it for you.

Now, all you have to do is become friendly with the reader who
My own advice: drop English.

Pitt engineers are quietly campaigning for an engineers lounge at
the bottom of the steps leading to the Bigelow entrance. If the
Democrats plan to make it an issue in their campaign, even Bilbo
can have this vote. Some of the women at Pitt seem to be going
along with the ruling in a patriotic spirit.‘ Or perhaps hitch hiking
during this power strike is more difﬁcult than it seems?

Meanwhile, no one can agree on anything. Mueller and Du-
quesne Light ‘can’t agree. Byrnes and Molotov can’t agree. The pro-
fessors and the students, of course, never could agree, but the men
at Pitt are unanimous———-there aren’t enough women here. The women
are happy about the whole thing. They have only one suggested im-
provement—more men.

Favored Pitt Eleven
Held To Scoreless
Deadlock by Owls

Pushing and shoving each other
around on a sloshy and rain sat-
urated quagmire, Pitt and Temple
played to a 0-0 tie, last Saturday.

It was a dull. uneventful scrim-
mage, brought about by the all
day downpour that limited the
crowd to sixty some thousand em-
pty seats, and about 2,500 hud-
dled, drenched and disillusioned
onlookers.

Aside from one or two threats
to threaten, the majority of the
playing time. was spent chasing
punts between the two 30 yard
lines. It was‘, cautious football at
its best, with both ‘temple and
Pitt afraid to try anything that
might result in a score.

Pitt brought the student body
to its feet only once, when Bill
Bruno almost broke away on a
39 yard punt return. All of the
Panthers’ offensive tricks were
stalled by the treacherous footing
and the Owl forward wall. ,.

Statistically, the Felser squad
was superior, making seven ﬁrst

"Teflon/’ Product of Group

Research, is Solving Diffi-

cult Problems in Radar,
Television and Industry

5 A group of Du Pont research men
were looking for a new refrigerant of
a particular type. These men found
what.they were after; but, as so often
has been the case, they found some-
thing more—this time an industrial
plastic whose unique qualities make
it invaluable in many ﬁelds.

During the study, the chemist in
charge proposed a route to the syn-
thesis of HCFZCFZCI via tetraﬂuoro-
ethylene, CF,,,=CF.,. In working with
the latter, a chemically reactive gas
boiling at —76.3C./760 mm., it was
learned that it polymerized to form

. a resin having unusual properties.

After evaluation by organic and
physical chemists, physicists and
electrical experts, at suitable process

. for the difficult manufacture of this
product was worked out by the chem-
ists in collaboration with chemical
and mechanical engineers.

Structure and Properties
“Teﬂon” is made by polymerizing
gaseous tetroﬂuoroethylene to give
a solid, granular polymer:

or properties. For this reason it may
have yvide use in such applications as
tubing and piping for chemical plants
and acid-distillation equipment.

Because the dielectric loss factor
is extremely low, even at frequencies
up to 3000 megacycles, it is an ex-
cellent insulating material for cur-
rents of ultra-high frequency. Its
heat—resisting and aging qualities
suggest immediate uses as a dielectric
in coaxial cables for color television,
and in radar and power ﬁelds.

Forms of ”Teflon” Available

By use of special techniques the new
plastic can be extruded as rods,
tubes or wire coating. In general, its
extrusion rates are low in compari-
son to other thermoplastics because
of its resistance to softening.

products which represent the work
and skill of Du Pont men, who, work-
ing as a team, contribute toward a
better America for you andall of us.

The ﬂuorine atoms in the molecule
impart exceptional properties of re— ’
sistance to heat and chemicals. I ‘

“Teﬂon” has unusual heat resist-
ance. Having no true melting point,

* “Teﬂon” decomposes slowly to give
the gaseous monomer and a few
other gaseous ﬂuorine derivatives at
around 400°C. Under certain condi-
tions small amounts of ﬂuorine-con-
taining gases have been observed at
temperatures above 230°C. Because
of its heat resistance, gaskets and
wire insulation for jet engines are
now made of this plastic. It is also K
used in aircraft ignition systems near
sparkplugs and in high-temperature
heating systems.

The chemical resistance of “Tef-
lon” is such that it withstands the
attack of all materials except molten
alkali metals. Boiling in acid (aqua
regia, hydroﬂuoric acid or fuming
nitric acid) will not change its weight
