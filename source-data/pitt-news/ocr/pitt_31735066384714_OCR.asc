Pitt Still Paying Interest, Posvar Tells Council

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staffwriter

Pitt continues to pay some
$2,000 per day in interest charges,
Chancellor Posvar reported to the
Senate Council yesterday.

“We are still spending $2,000 a
day in interest because the state is
late in payments to the University,”
Posvar said.

The state is currently $20 million
behind in state aid payments to the
University.

On a more positive note, Posvar
reminded the Council that the
General Assembly has advocated a
four-percent increase «in aid for next

year.

“We are not assured of getting
that increase, though,” Posvar
said.

He indicated that the legislators
tend to “overfund” initially, then
make cuts as the budget deadline
approaches.

Campus Police ambulance ser-
vice will be stopped as of June 30
because of a lack of state funding,
Campus Police Chief Curt Graham
announced yesterday.

“Because of the budget handed
down by the state, the University is
forced to cut back on a lot of
programs,” Graham explained.
“This is one program Campus
Police provide that we felt could be
picked up by another organiza-
tion.”

Posvar added that the primary
races have slowed down proceed-
ings on budgetary matters in
Harrisburg for the time.

“We (the University) cannot act
on the budget until after the
primaries,” he said.

Posvar also reported on the
outcome of the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board (PLRB) hearing
yesterday to decide possible
unionization of Pitt’s clerical and
technical staff members. The PLRB
confirmed a June 7 election to
decide whether staff members will
unionize. The last time an election
was held (1976) the motion was
defeated by morethan 62 percent.

In other business, the Council
decided the Student Affairs Com-
mittee of the Council will reevaluate
the University Review Board
(URB). According to Sue Thomp-
son, School of General Studies

take over the Campus Police’s
emergency calls, including more
than 300 patient tranfers from

the Student Health Center,”
Graham said. “And persons can

Lack Of Funding Cancels Campus Ambulance Service

until the ambulance arrives. All of
our first-aid equipment will be
carried in the patrol cars——we’re
just getting rid of the three vans and
stretchers. ’ ’

Despite the abolishment of
ambulance service, no Campus
Police employees will be laid off
because of the move, Graham said.

“We have 35 officers trained at
the EMT 1 level, and we’re going to
keep them trained and certiﬁed at
that level,” he said. “We’ll still

maintain them—no other officers
were hired over last year, and we
lost 10 for different reasons. That
brings us exactly to the level of
police manpower we must have.
There will be no layoffs.”

Alternative program cuts were

‘considered, Graham claimed, but

were not feasible.

“We could have taken officers
out of the dormitories, for
example,” he explained, “but city
police wouldn’t replace them.
Ambulance service was one of the

Srakocic photo

things that could be replaced by
someone else.”

Graham believes the absence of a
Campus Police ambulance service
will not ‘affect emergency situa-
tions, such as the Langley Hall
explosion in January 1977.

‘ ‘The only effect on an emergency
situation will be that the Campus
Police won’t be ‘ one of the
organizations to take emergency
victims to hospitals,” he said.
‘ ‘It's not that we’re not coming—we
just won’t bring an ambulance.”

On Webster sale

Variety Of Customers Converge

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Approximately 5,000 people
have passed through the doors of
the Hotel Webster Hall in the past
month, spending close to $200,000
on furniture, carpeting and other
fixtures of the former hotel that has
served Oakland since 1926.

The sale comes as the ﬁnal move
in paving the way for an $8-million
rennovation project that will convert
the 12-ﬂoor hotel into a shopping,

business and apartment complex,
scheduled for completion in 1980.
According to night manager Bob
Artman, the plans for the complex
call for a three-ﬂoor shopping mall
complete with bank, restaurants,
boutiques and other specialty
shops, with the remaining nine
ﬂoors reservedifor two- and three-

“bargains” on any of the wide
variety of furnishings, while others
possessed more nostalgic views and
curiously scanned displays, seeking
souvenirs of the hotel that for years
played host to some top-name
sports and entertainment figures.

Convention Focuses On Middle East Politics

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

Hearing speakers such as Senator
James Abourezk (D-S.D.) and
Ghasan Tueni, the Lebanese
ambassador to the United Nations,
some 700 members of the National
Association of Arab Americans
(NAAA) met last weekend at the
William Penn Hotel for their sixth
annual convention. .

The group participated in lect-
ures, receptions and panel dis-
cussions focusing on the political
situation in the Middle East and
problems facing Arab-Americans.

The NAAA, with its main office in
Washington D.C., lobbies in both
Congress and at the White House-.

Members at the convention voted
on political position the Association
will take.

Alexander Simon, NAAA vice
president, said those issues include
“occupation of southern Lebanon,
the sale and use of CBU’s (cluster
bombs) to Israel and the rights of
the Palestinians to have their own
homeland.”

Simon said the Association
supports President Carter’s contro-
versial plane sale because “of the
overriding political. significance of
the sales to Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.” He added that the NAAA
is unhappy with the planes for Israel
but is willing to accept it.

The proposed sale, which is now

creating controversy in Congress, is
a $4.8-billion package that would
send 50F-SE fighters to Egypt, 60
F-15 fighter-bombers to Saudi
Arabia and 75 F-16’s and 15 F-15’s
to Israel. The F-15 is regarded as
the world’s best combat plane.
“There is no basis for danger
from selling F-15’s to Saudi
Arabia,” Abourezk (who is of

Lebanese background) said at a -

press conference Saturday.

Saudi Arabia, he said, would not
attack Israel, and added “the
Saudis are not suicidal.”

Abourezk also said a “greater
balance in American foreign policy
concerning the Middle East is
slowly taking,pl,ace.” I y

-  ~« ~ -~,..{‘./;

“I want to take a stand that will
benefit the United States, not Israel
or the Arabs,” he said.

Tueni said his country cannot be
blamed for its civil war.

“Lebanon can be built into a

_harmonious society as in the past,”

Tueni said.

Tueni added that Lebanon
supports the “Palestinian revolu-
tion” but criticized them for
associating exclusively with leftist
elements.

“The Palestinians should have
sought the support from all
Lebanese,” he said.

Referring to Israel, Tueni said:
“Peace cannot come from security

T SGB Begins Spring Work

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The proposed change in the
State’s drinking law, and the Pitt
Glee Club were discussed at the
first public Student Government
Board meeting of the spring
session.

Board member Stan Galanski
drafted a resolution stating the
Board’s support for a Senate bill
that would lower drinking age in the
state from 21 to 19. The bill is
currently under debate in the
House. At the same time, the Board
voted to urge state legislators to
defeat a House bill that would
eliminate the Pennsylvania State
Store system.

“It (the current liquor control
system) provides a mechanism for

the enforcement of Pennsylvania’s

alcohol staus,” the  reS01llti0n
reads. “We question the safe-
guards on age restrictions available
under the package store system.”

“The Board has always advocat-
ed the 19-year-old drinking bill,”
Galanski said. “We want to insure
that responsible drinking patterns
emerge.”

The board also voted to support
the Pitt Glee Club in it's effort to
gain more funding and a full-time

music director.
Arguments were presented by

club members Warren Hutchinson,
Scott Derco and Joe Mclntyre.

According to Mclntyre, the glee
club’s touring budget has been
reduced more than $4,000, and
rehearsal time has been cut in half
in recent years.

 

SresitiJosh Baylson (lettl,and board member J; Med if at yester-

“We should have some increase
in funds, ” Hutchinson said. “Since
we are an accredited group, I feel
we should also be able to have a
full-time faculty member as music
director.”

In other Business, the board
reviewed the newly drafted by-laws
of the Public Affairs-Govemmental

Government but tabled final
-approval until Thursday's meeting.

Thornburgh And Marston
Seek Pittsburgh Votes

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—With United States Senator H. John Heinz III
tagging along, candidate Richard Thornburgh shopped for votes
here yesterday for the upcoming Republican gubernatorial primary.
So did an opponent, former United States attorney David Marston.
His wife tagged along.

“Would you like to meet Dick Thornburgh? ’ ’ Heinz asked anyone
in earshot. “We need a great Governor and Dick Thornburgh will be

that Governor.”

They were surrounded by newsmen and cameramen as they
handed out brochures to the crowd.

Heinz endorsed Thornburgh last week, several days after the
state’s other United States Senator, Richard Schweiker, endorsed
Marston. Schweiker was to hook up with Marston today.

Two other major Republican gubernatorial contenders, Arlen
Specter and Robert Butera, spent the day shoring up votes in the
Philadelphia area. A fifth candidate, Senate Minority Leader Henry
Hager campaigned in Altoona.

Heinz, who nipped Specter in the 1974 United States Senate
Republican primary, told a newsman: “I don’t think the race is
between Thornburgh and Specter.” -

At every chance, he touted Thornburgh’s record as a federal
prosecutor, saying: “He’d be a compassionate, concerned
Governor and that’s what our state needs after so many years of
mismanagement.”

After shaking hands at a bus turnaround in Pittsburgh, Marston
campaigned in Washington, Greensburg and Ligonier.

Hager, who got into the race late, has concentrated his campaign
in the state’s small cities and towns. His campaign manager,
Donald Schearer, said today: “We need a turnout of 65 percent or
better in ‘Hager Country’ to beat the other candidates.”

Rosalynn Attends Latin

Am erican Inaugaration
By The Associated Press

a SAN JOSE, Costa Rica——Rodrigo Carazo received the symbolic
presidential sash yesterday to become Costa Rica’s 36th president,
then told a crowd of 20,000, including Rosalynn Carter, that this
Central American nation would cease harboring “international
delinquents.”

The new President pledged in his campaign to expel fugitive
American ﬁnancier Robert Vesco.

Carazo, 51, repeated the oath of office administered by the head
of the National Assembly after outgoing President Daniel Oduber
surrendered the red, white and blue silk should sash at a ceremony
in the national soccer stadium.

Mrs. Carter heded the delegation from the United States, one of
67 nations represented at Carazo’s inauguration for a four-year
term.

Cheers and applause erupted when the American delegation was
announced and the First Lady, accompanied by seven Americans,
crossed the ﬁeld behind three Costa Rican high school students
carrying an American ﬂag.

Thunder and lightning punctuated the four-and-a-half-hour
ceremony, and rain began pouring into the open stadium shortly
after Carazo began to speak. Mrs. Carter and other dignitaries were
protected on the covered stand. 7

Carazo said his government was created by a “free, frank and
open” election, adding that “the people were true to their
democratic vocation and we are ready to fulﬁll these hopes and
ideals.” V 7

Costa Rica has a 79-year-old tradition of democracy. It has no
army and is one of the few nations in the hemisphere where the
literacy rate exceeds 90 percent. On arrival yesterday, Mrs. Carter
said in Spanish here visit showed “U.S. backing of the democracy
that exists here.”

in borders but will have to be an
attitude of (mutual) acceptance.”

However, when asked if Lebanon
would talk directly with Israel, as
Egypt's President Sadat has done,
he replied: “No comment.”

Other topics covered included
media treatment of Arabs and the
Middle East, American foreign
policy and interests in the area
human rights and Arab-American
legal issues.

John P. Richardson, NAAA
directors of public affairs, said
while NAAA members hold dif-

fering views on the Middle East,
“everyone has hope that there will
be movement toward peace.”

There were. varying opinions
expressed at the conference,
particularly on the Palestinian
issue. While the Association
supports Palestinian rights to a
homeland and the idea of a “ secular
state, ” a term that is interpreted by
many to mean Israel’s destruction,
it has not endorsed Israel’s
destruction. _

One speaker, Najeeb Halaby,

talking on American interests in the
Middle East, said he is ‘ ‘looking for

a more moderate PLO voice.”
“We see peace proposals from
Sadat, the United States and Israeli
Prime Minister Begin. I’d like to
see a peace plan from the
Palestinians,” he said.

“Raiding Israel and then having
Lebanon invaded and having
hundreds of people killed is not the
way,” said Halaby. “We don’t

want to wipe anyoneoff the map.” '

Halaby told the Arab-American
audience that they should “support
President Carter and Secretary
Vance 100 percent.”

Webster Sale In Fu|lSwing

(Continued from Page 1)

(one of the few items not for sale).
“It’s sort of sad in a way that it
won’t be around anymore,” she
said. “I guess that’s partly why we
came here today, just to take a last
look and see if it still looked the
same after all these years.” -
In the lobby, an elderly man and
his wife stood, watching merchan-
dise being carried outside. They
reminisced about some of the
baseball stars who occupied Web-
ster during the Forbes Field era.
“Those days sure were ex-

1 citing,’’ the man said. “I’ve lived in

this area all my life, and I saw the
stars and the big-league baseball
players come and go. I guess I'll

never see it again though, at least

not at the Webster Hall.”

Artman said that many attending
the sale in the past four weeks were,
in fact, “-souvenir seekers” who
wanted to buy anything reminiscent
of the old hotel.

‘ ‘In the ﬁrst week, "we had a lot of
people who came more to look than
to buy,” Artman said. “Most of the
people were really shopping for a
piece of furniture or a ﬁxture at a
reasonable price, which was shown
by the profits.”

A number of Pitt students housed
on the second, third and fourth
floors of the hotel reportedly
secured souvenirs in an unorthodox
manner before their housing

contract expired April 26.

“We had sections of carpets
removed from the rooms and also
some outright vandalism like
wallpaper being ripped from the
walls and furniture being broken.”
Artman said. A

According to Artman, no action is
being planned against the students
assigned to the vandalized rooms or
against the University, which
contracted the rooms from Web-
ster.

The liquidation sale is scheduled
to end May 18. Employees"of the
hotel, many of whom have up to 30
years service have been placed in
other hotels throughout the city by
their union. ‘

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Budget Cut Victim

Insufficient funds have killed another University program, forc-
ing the cancellation of the Campus Police’s ambulance service, ef-
fective June 30. This handy program provided emergency trans-
port for students and others on campus for several years, but ap-
propriation cuts by the State Legislature have forced Chief Curt
Graham to trim his budget and sell the three vans used as ambulan-

CCS.

In this instance, city agencies can fill the gap left by the loss of
the ambulances with Emergency Medical Services facilities located

near the Pitt campus. When emergency situations arise, campus‘

officers can still provide first aid and even transportation’ when the
case involves injured people able to sit. Police must call Emergency
Medical Services only when someone must be moved by stretcher.

Cancellation seems only-a minor inconvenience to the Pitt com-

Cutting.the ambulance service still raises a dangerous precedent

established funding areas must be eminent unless the State

Legislature’s attitude toward supporting higher education changes

drastically.‘

of belt-tightening administrators, no other government body can be

Letters to the Editor

A Simple ‘Thank You’Notg Enough ,

My family and I want to express
our deep thanks and appreciation to
the University community for all of
its kindness and support during our
time of sorrow. Your prayers and
expressions of kindness and
concern helped to sustain us during
this very difficult time.

Though _the burden life has
placed upon us appears awesome,

i we are comforted by the breadth

and depth of sincere concern you so
heartfully expressed. All the words
for thank you seem inadequate for
the deep feelings we have for‘ you
-and the outpouring of love you
extended toward. us, but we know
you understand what your concern
has meant to us and will continue to
mean to us in the still difficult times
to come. I ‘ ’
Please accept our humble res-

i
i

l

ponse to all of you who donated
blood, money, clothing and letters
and cards of inspiration. You
cannot begin to understand what
those things meant to us. But we
do. Also, we must give a very, very
special note of appreciation to Gus
Reinecke, assistant vic_e-chancellor
for human resources.
 Gus spearheaded and coordin-
ated the response you made to us/in
"an hour of need. We must also
thank Josh, Baylson, Student
Government Board president, the
Greekorganizations and the hun-
dreds of students who did‘ whatever
they could to assist us. , —
‘Words cannot really express our
gratitude to them and to you. We
were not surprised by your
generosity; we believe people are
basically and intrinsically loving.

Though we sometimes, get so
caught up in “making it” from day
to day, whenever a situation arises
necessitating‘ human warmth and
compassion, there is always an
abundance of love forthcoming.

, Bless each and every one of you for

reafﬁrming our beliefs.
Finally, let us all approach the
difficult days ahead with this

_ beautiful thought: “Lord, grant me _

the serenity to accept the things I
cannot change...the courage to

change those things I can...and the

wisdom to know the difference.”
Again, though the words seem

insufficient, thank you from the '

bottom of our hearts. ‘You are truly
wonderful people. —

.   PennDot Graft

andPotholes: Nonsense

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Bob "Casey, the 'former auditor
general seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, blames
PennDot’s inability to maintain our
state roads on corruption within the

‘ department. His campaign adver- '

tisements promise to stop granting
contracts to “fat-cat” political

, “contributors.

The flock of candidates pursuing
the Governorship echo Casey’s
feelings about PennDot. Republi-

. can Arlen Specter proposes to use

the “Missouri plan” to remove
political inﬂuence from the trans-

portation department.
Lieutenant Governor Ernie Kline is
brave (or foolish) enough to
advocate a liquid fuel taxdncrease to
help better road construction and
repair in the state.

Blaming corruption for our
pothole-pocked state highways and
the suspension of new road

construction in Pennsylvania seems’

a popular avenue to political
stardom, but it shows pitiful
ignorance about the dilemma
challenging the Department of
Transportation.

The problems faced by PennDot
ofﬁcials result from chronic under-
funding of maintenance projects

Only

over the last two decades. New
highway construction has instead
been pushed by the state and
Federal Government. Pennsylvania
has paved more and more miles of
land without worrying about monies
for resurfacing, surface treatment
and snow removal.

Debt service on the bonds paying
for Pennsylvania’s past construc-
tion projects bleeds a sizeable
amount of state revenues. One
quarter of the Motor License Fund
presently supports debt service as
state law requires. These mandated
expenditures for bond issues plus
those for state police highway
patrols decreases available funds
for road maintenance and construc-
tion, which must also be supported
from the license fund.

As a result. resurfacing and

surface treatment of the 45,000

miles of state roads has been wholly
inadequate for many years. Penn-
Dot ﬁgures show only 4,000 of the
8.600 miles of highways requiring
resurfacing were repaved during
the 1976-77 ﬁscal year. From July
1977 to July 1978 only 16 percent of
the roads needing to be paved can
be repaired. Estimates by the
Department of Transportation pre-
dict 28 percent of state thorough-
fares requiring surfacing can be
fixed over the 1978-79 fiscal year.
Last winter's storms and the
spring thaw probably leaves the

state road system in worse condition
than ever PennDot expected, and
much more than the estimated
amount of highways now desperat-

dom. ”

ely need to be repaved or patched.
No greater funds exist for repair
work, however. '

While Federal estimates show
highway maintenance costs increas-
ing at nine percent a year, revenues
from gasoline tax grow only 2.6 per
year at the current nine-cent tax
rate. Since the Pennsylvania
Legislature defeated a proposed
liquid fuels tax increase last year,
there is no chance that tax levels can
keep pace with spiralling repair
costs and make some real gains on
maintenance deﬁciencies.

Unless car owners enjoy the
present road conditions, increased
gasoline taxes seem to be the only

answer to PennDot’,s problems.

Governor Shapp’s suggested three-
and—a-half cent increase in the
gasoline tax with a sliding scale to
compensate for inﬂation funding
deficiencies. ‘

Meanwhile the wolf pack of

-gubernatorial candidates play on

post-Watergate voter attitudes and
blame every Pennsylvania crisis on
corruption. Certainly, PennDot
contains incidences of graft, but
contributing PennDot’s financial
troubles to only mismanagement
and contract kickbacks is misrep-
resentation of the facts.

Any honest politician must
recognize extra money is necessary
to improve our highways, and the
only source of this money under
current law is gasoline taxes,
highway users taxes, license and
auto registration fees and limited
Federal funds."

If the various candidates for
gubernatorital nominations want to
better our state road system,
restructuring of the funding for
maintenance and construction
should be their worry, not
sensational claims about supposed
rampant graft. Until candidates
recognize’ this and .propose new
funding procedures, as well as root
out PennDot corruption, car owners
can look forward to many more
years of playing dodge the pothole.

.After appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former

Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger endorsed the increase of plane sales for

Israel.

By The Associated Press

WASHlNGTON—Former Secre-
tary of State Henry A. Kissinger
urged yesterday that the admini-
stration increase sales to Israel in its
Mideast jet ﬁghter package amid
growing signs that a compromise
along that line was under discus-
sion.

Kissinger appeared before the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, which decided to delay until
today a planned closed session for
further discussion of the admini-
stration plan to sell ﬁghters to
Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia..

Asked about the signﬁcance of
the pstponement of the private
session, Senate Minority Leader
Howard H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.)
replied: “You might assume
something was going to happen.

promise was in the ofﬁng, -White

Beleagured State Representatives

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—The General
Assembly, its image tarnished by a
disastrous budget performance last
year and continuing allegations of ‘
corruption, faces a rather tame state
primary.

More than 700 names will appear
on legislative primary ballots across
the state. And constituents are
unhappy with everything from
potholes to pensions for convicted
felons.

Of the 25 Senate races, there are
only three districts where both
parties have contests. There are 11
districts where both sides have
candidates with no opposition.

In the House, where all 203 seats
are at stake, -there are 94
incumbents who face no primary

opposition. And there are 74 House
districts where both parties have
candidates who are unopposed.

There are more than 150
Republicans and more than 100
Democrats running unopposed in
the House primaries. There are 11
House districts where one party or
the other hasn’t even bothered to
put any candidate on the ballot.

That’s not to say there aren’t a
few interesting contests.

In each of two Allegheny County
House districts, there are 10
Democrats ﬁghting to replace
departing incumbents, Thomas
Flaherty and Robert Geisler.
Anotherseven Democrats hope to
take Michael Mu1ten’s seat in that
county.

-.9 Face Primary Election Tuesday

Four Senate incumbents are not
running for re-election this year,
and there are 20 House districts
with no incumbent on the ballot,
including seven where the incum-
bent is quitting to run for another
political ofﬁce.

Another four House members are
running for the House and for other
political ofﬁces at the same time.
They include House Majority
Leader James Mandering (D-West-
moreland) who is another House
Democrat, Joseph Petrarca.

In Erie County, State Repre-
sentative Robert Bellomini is in a
ﬁght because he faces Federal
extortion charges. Three other
Democrats and three Republicans
are trying to replace him.

Kissinger Announces Support
for Added Jet Sales to Israel

said at a brieﬁng that President
Carter “made it quite clear that the
proposals before Congress will not
be altered."

But he added: “What is_possible
outside those limits remains to be
seen,” an indication the Ad-
ministration does not preclude
committment for an additional sale
of jet ﬁghters to Israel separate
from the sales proposals already
before Congress.

At the State Department,
spokesman Hodding Carter refused
to disclose details of negotiations
underway between Congressional
leaders and the Administration, but
noted changes in the numbers of
planes for each country could be
made in the present package if the
White House and Congress con-
sent. '

Elsewhere, Saudi Arabian oil

minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said
his country does not see a direct
linkage between Saudi oil sales and
the purchase of the American
ﬁghters. But he said it would be
“naive” to think that a rejection of
one would not affect the other.

The former secretary of state
strongly endorsed increasing the
number of planes slated for Israel.

He said the 75 F-165 and 15 F-15
jet ﬁghters were “at the very lowest
end of the spectrum of the numbers
discussed during the Ford Ad-
ministration.

“The numbers requested while I
was in ofﬁce were several orders of
magnitude above this,” Kissinger
added.

In addition, Kissinger said that
the earlier figures were not
discussed in the context of sales to

Rivers F lunks ‘Test’ in Directorial Debut

By PATTY T ASCARELIA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Rabbit Test
Directed by Joan Rivers

Actually, “Rabbit Test” could
have been a very funny movie. But
Joan Rivers wrote and directed it,
and it isn’t. Not that Joan Rivers
can’t be funny—she simply insists
on hitting the audience over the
head withevery one-liner until the

.whole film is one big headache.

ARTS

A headache might have prevent-
ed the whole plot—Billy Crystal
'(“Soap’s” Jodie, the resident
switch hitter)—plays an innocent
young man who becomes pregnant.
Once the news gets out, a horde

of gypsies proclaims him as their
messiah. Imogene Coca heads the

troupe and is rather amusing until .

her accent starts to smother out her

lines. And even the president of the.

United States gets into the act.
George Gobel is easily‘ the best
thing in the film. First, he wants
Crystal to have an abortion, then he
wants to make him an ambassador.

But when he is dressed as Porky Pig

for the White House Halloween
party, it’s the only time laughter
isn’t forced.

Excessiveness is the problem
with “Rabbit Test.” The lines ﬂy
fast and furious but make no
ultimate impact. From Coco’s
goulash accent to Paul Lynde as the
snickering obstetrician to the hero
himself, Crystal, “Rabbit Test”
ends in overkill.

Crystal, saving the last, is so
abnormally nice, so Charlie Brown-
ish, as wholesome as a Hallmark
card, that he translates the whole
mess from satire to blandness. He
is completely artiﬁcial and so banal
a mainstay that whatever a chance
“Rabbit Test” might have had, it's
failed. Crystal was not the original
choice for the role, but that still
doesn’t excuse his performance.
Imagine what, say, Chevy Chase
could have done with the part.

Back to overkill, though, Rivers
even used more of it in selling the
picture than she did in making it.
The full-page advertisements and
the talk show appearances are
admittedly all part of selling a film
to the public. But why does Rivers
have to plunk her own picture
(with a very coy smugness stretched
across her face) next to Crystal's in
the billings? Maybe she wanted to
play his part in drag. And maybe it
would have been an improvement.

For Grateful Dead A

 

Rock Stardom Not What It Appears to Be

By CINDI EVAN GELISTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Everyone dreams of becoming a
rock star at least once in his lifetime.

Being one is not what it appears
to be, however. In a backstage
interview at the Civic Arena, guitar
aces Bob Wehr and Jerry Garcia
reflected on some of their
experiences—good and bad-—as
part of the Grateful Dead.

One would think that a rock star’s
dressing room would be large and
accomodating—not so. The Grate-
_fu1 Dead were given straight-back
chairs in a small, sparsely furnished

‘room. But, they’re used to it; small

dressing rooms are part of the deal.
Wehr and Garciajust shrugged it
off and aimed their discussion

) toward the press.

“Interviews can get pretty
tiring,” Wehr said.

“Yeah,” Garcia agreed. “Espe-
cially after the fourteenth-billionth
time, you know? The same thing

over and over...”

“It also depends on who is doing
the interview,” Wehr said. “We
can’t stand interviews with ugly old
reporters. Having a nice reporter
always makes the interview more
pleasant and tolerable.”

Bill Kreutcma, the Grateful
Dead's drummer since 1964, felt
slightly more animosity toward
interviews. ‘

“Questions! Questions!" he
screamed. “How can so many
questions ‘come out of a little guy
like you? Man! Questions!"

Garcia agreed with Kreutcma and
decided to join him in a disturbing
silence and refusal to answer
logically. Instead, the two sat back
and listened to the tape deck, which
by then, had repeated Warren
Zevon’s new hit, “The Werewolves

of London” for the 13th time.
The group burst into fits of

howling wolf calls and laughter. .

Garcia prodded Wehr to tell the
story of why the group liked the
tune.

Being a rock star Wehr explain-
ed, means traveling--from the
airport to the hotel to the stage-
and an aggravating tension in the

players from being shuttled back
and forth constantly.

Once, the groups’s chauffeur was
driving “too slow.” The band
members began to chide the driver
into going faster at which the
chauffeur replied with sarcastic
remarks about the group's “un-
couthness.”

When the chauffeur decided to
drive even slower, the Grateful
Dead decided to dump him and took
off with the limousine, Wehr behind

the wheel. “Werewolves” then
came on over the radio and the
group rode around listening to the
song and howling out the windows.

Outside,
grew restless; the group was taking
too long for a break between sets.
During the concert, the Grateful
dead took five to 10 minutes
between each song, even though
each number was done well.

“Let them go,” said Wehr.
“They’re always like that.”

the Arena audience.

But they had already knocked
down the first two rows of seats,
trying to get to the front.
“Sometimes the audience is okay,”
Wehr said. “But when the crowd
gets too destructive, I’d rather just
walk off.

“It’s good to get a little craziness
into the audience, though,” he said.
“Then you just sit back and let the
m-a-a-a-dness take over!”

A stage hand came into the room '

and announced: “Okay you guys,

it’s time to go. Two minutes!”

‘ ‘Already?’ ’ Aww no!”

“Not yet!”

Wehr stood up and headed for the
door.

“Come on,” he said.

99

“We better
go.
They reluctantly stood up and
walked down the aisle to the stage.
Then, as they walked onto the
stage, Wehr took a deep breath.

‘ ‘Awwoooooo! ’ ’

The Grateful Dead was back to
finish the second half of a concert.

Members of the rock group Grateful Dead hate being interviewed. “The same thing over and over...” guitar ace
Jerry Garcia complained to The Pitt News.

Scherich’s Record Spurs Pantherettes in EAIAW Meet

ByBOBLABRIOLA
Pitt News Staffwriter

Paced by the performance of
Carmen Scherich, who became only
the third Eastern champion in
Pantherette history, the Pitt
women’s track team ﬁnished in a
ﬁfth-place tie in last weekend’s
EAIAW Championship meet at
Slippery Rock.

Scherich set a new Eastern record
in the javelin with a heave of 152-3,
which was 11 feet better than her
closest rival, Sharon Hagerich of
Slippery Rock. In winning the
event, Scherich joins two-time
winner Martha Suhayda as the only
Pantherettes to win an event in the
EAIAW meet. Suhayda won the
shot put and the discus before
transferring to Maryland with
basketball player Debbie Jones.

Penn State finished ﬁrst in the
team competition, outdistancing
second-place Maryland by 60 points
for the title. Rutgers placed third,
followed by Delaware State, with
the University of D.C. and Pitt tied
for ﬁfth. 0

Gwen Murray earned all-East
recognition (ﬁnishing second in the
200-meter dash, won by Liz Young
of the University of D.C.) as did
Marie_Ribik and the members of the
mile relay and the 880-yard medley
relay.

Ribik cleared the necessary
height to finish second in the high‘
jump, but ended up third on more
misses at that level. Paula Gervin of
Maryland, a memberof the 1976
United States Olympic team, won
the event.

Both the mile relay (Leslie

Palmer, Linda Mitchell, Murray
and Lisa Haupt) and the 880-yard
medley relay (Louise Carlson,
Mitchell, Murray and Haupt) came
in third and will compete in the
National championship meet at the
University of Tennessee during the
last weekend in May.

The Pantherettes were somewhat
hampered by the scheduling of the
events, since several individual
qualifying heats were held at the
same time as the relays. The time
conflict caused Murray to miss the

Panthers Drop Twinbill To
Lose Eight of Last Ten    

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Playing its ﬁfth doubleheader in
eight days, Pitt’s baseball team
(11-15-1) lost, 15-8 and 4-2, at‘
Indiana (Pa.) Sunday.

The Panthers, winners of only
two of their last 10 games, close out
the season with single contests at
Gettysburg, Bucknell and Temple
this week.

“The kids were tired,” Panther
coach Bobby Lewis said after
Sunday’s doubleheader loss. ‘ ‘Five
doubleheaders in eight days is a lot
of ball.”

In past seasons, Pitt could count '

on a doubleheader cancellation or
two. The Panthers have had no such
luck this season; only a few of their
games have been cancelled or
postponed.

If Pitt plays its three remaining
games, this year would mark the
ﬁrst time in more than a decade a
Panther team would have played 30
games. Having played 27, this
year’s Panthers have already

played the most games since the

91971 team played 26.

‘.‘We’ve been lucky so far this
season as far as the weather is
concerned,” Lewis said.
more games you play, the better it
is. But I still think our kids would
have welcomed a break last week. ’ ’

Indiana State, which earlier
accepted an invitation to play in the
National Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics playoffs later this
month, collected ﬁve runs in each of
the ﬁrst three innings to win the
ﬁrst game.

Pitt starter Jim Boyle, pitching
two-thirds of an inning, gave up all
ﬁve of the Indians’ ﬁrst-inning runs
before leaving in favor of reliever
Tony DiSaia.

The winners rapped out 14 hits in
the game.

“I don’t want to take anything
away from their hitting,” Lewis
said. “They have a nice hitting ball
club. But I don’t think our pitching
was that strong, either. Playing so
many games in such a short period,
we had trouble ﬁnding an untired
pitching arm.”

“The I

The situation was so bad that
Lewis had to use reserve inﬁelder
Neal Fanelli and backup outﬁelder-
catcher Rich Fenoglietto as pitchers
in the ﬁrst game.

Fanelli surrendered ﬁve runs in
the two innings in which he pitched.
Fenoglietto, pitching in the final
four innings, didn’t give up any
runs, prompting Lewis to say “he’s
the only one on our staff with a
perfect earned run average.”

“I hope we can ﬁnd an untired
arm or two to pitch the last three
games,” Lewis said. “If we don’t, I
might have to pitch.”

Indiana State nicked starter Mike
Luciow for all of its runs in_the
second and third innings to win the
second game. Settling down after
giving up three runs in the third,
Luciow went the distance for the
Panthers. -

.“It was funny,” Lewis said.
“They got those four runs in the
ﬁrst couple of innings and that was
it. After that, Mike didn’t have any
trouble with them. He went on to

pitch a strong game for us.”

100-meter dash qualiﬁers. Project-
ing Murray’s times at that distance
with the times registered in the
100-meter ﬁnals at Slippery Rock,
the Pantherette sprinter could have
ﬁnished second or third in the
event. -

Also scoring for Pitt were Palmer,
who took ﬁfth in the 100-meter
hurdles, and the 400-meter relay
team (Lisa Sciullo, Pam Shaw,
Michelle Bressant and Mitchell)
that ﬁnished fourth.

Record setting was kept at a
minimum by the 45-degree temper-
atures and gusting winds that
prevailed at Slippery Rock. The
track, normally a decent facility,
was made somewhat substandard
by puddles of water that collected in

lane one as a result of two days of
rain.

Joining the two relay teams at the
National Championship meet will
be Scherich, Ribik, and Murray.

  Paterno Pulls No Punches in Proclaiming Lion Power

By The Associated Press

~ STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Penn
_ State coach Joe Paterno isn’t
pulling any punches.

‘ ‘We’ve got a really good football
team,” said Paterno after complet-
ing spring practice last week with
the annual intrasquad game. “And
we have a schedule that should
show just how good we are.

“I’m not claiming any particular
place in the ratings,” Paterno

, explained. “If we’re as good as we

can be, whatever happens
happens.” _

Penn State has the squad to make
Paterno’s dream of being the best
college football team in the nation
come true in 1978. He’s not making
that claim, but you get the
impression he wouldn’t be sur-
prised if it happens.

The Lions’ coach says such things
as:

—“We have great people at the
skilled positions...I don’t think any
team in the country has better
skilled people.”

—“Chuck Fusina is the best
quarterback we’ve ever had...We
never had a quarterback who had a
bett spring. Idon’tthink he threw
ﬁve d passes all spring.”

—“Matt Suhey (junior running
back) is a great athlete. We think
he's quicker than Franco, not as
smooth, but quicker.” (Franco is
Franco Harris, former Penn State

star and Pittsburgh Steelers’
runner.)

—“This will be an exciting,
explosive team...An exciting team
to watch. We’ll make a lot of big
plays. We have a lot of big-play
people on that offensive team.”

—“In Bruce Clark and Matt
Millen we have outstanding down
linemen. There are no better
people.”

Paterno admitted that he had
some problems, but he said they
were “good problems.” He has so
many good people he has to decide
where to use some of them and how
to get the most out of them.

Penn State’s kicking game is
intact. Placekicker Matt Bahr is
back and so is his backup,’ Tony
Capozzoli. Scott Fitzkee, a
spectacular wide receiver, returns
to handle the punting. Paterno does

have to develop a center for long I

snaps, a job handled last season by
all—America middle guard Randy
Sidler.

One of State’s biggest losses via
graduation is ﬂanker Jimmy Cefalo,
and Paterno says, “Tom Donovan
gives us the same kind of
performance as Cefalo. He’s in that
class. He and Suhey will return
kicks, an art in which Cefalo led the
nation in 1977.”

Paterno also lost tight end Mickey
Shuler, recently drafted by the New
York Jets. Is Paterno concerned?

He switched Irv Pankey from tackle
to tight end. Pankey is a 6-4‘/2,
250-pounder, blocks like a tank, has
excellent hands for pass catching
and can run with the ball.

If Penn State has a question mark
on this 1978 team, it is the defensive
secondary.

“We need our secondary to take
charge of the game...something we
haven’t had the last couple of
years,” Paterno said. “I’m
encouraged, but we’re not there
yet.”

As of spring practice, Paterno is
sure of only three defensive
backs——Mike Guman, Mike Gilsen-
an and Pete Harris. But he has
great ' potential in Joe Diminick,
Tom Wise, Grover Edwards and
karl McCoy. If he can, Paterno
would rather use Guman on offense.

Guman is a solid runner, one of
the best to come out of Pennsyl-
vania’s Lehigh Valley Bethlehem
High, but State needed help last
season on defense, and Guman was
switched to comerback. He helped
the team to an 11-1 record,
including a Fiesta.Bowl triumph
over Arizona State.

“I guess if I use Guman on
offense it will keep me from getting
600 letters from the Lehigh Valley,’ ’
Paterno jested. The area was up in
arms over one of the best runners
ever developed winding up on
defense. '

“Mike Guman came to me after
the season and told me, ‘I want you
to know that I don’t care where I
play, but I’d like to start and stay

there,’ ” Paterno said. “I told him

I’d try.”

What bothers Paterno is that he
has three ﬁne running backs in
Suhey, Bob Torrey and sophomore
Booker Moore. He needs a fourth,
and Guman would be perfect if the
Lions can get along without him in
the secondary. Rich Milot and a
couple of other younger players
might just step in and take care of
that additional runner. _

On the offensive line, Paterno has
available such people as tackles
Keith Dorney and Jim Brown,
center Chuck Correal, guards Eric

Cunningham, Jim Romano and’

Marty Sierocinski.

On defense, in addition to Clark
and Millen, the Lions have tackle
Tony Petruccio, middle guard Frank
Case, linebackers Rick Donaldson,
Craig Coder, Gene Gladys, Steve
Grifﬁtlis, Lance Mehl and Paul
Suhey.

Paterno is high on this team
despite a spring he wasn’t too
pleased with, because he rushed the
20 allowable days within four weeks
instead of ﬁve. This was necessary
because the spring game had to be a
week earlier, in Hershey, since
Penn State’s stadium expansion
work wasn’t ﬁnished.

“Maybe I worked them too long
and too hard,” Paterno explained.

“As a result it wasn’t as productive. :j

I blame myself. They were tired
and so were the coaches. But we
should have a better football team
than we had last year. We have
more experience in key spots. But a
key injury could mean problems. A
lot of things have to come together. I
don’t want to see headlines that I
said we’d be No. 1.” _

But the bottom line is that the
Lions will be better than a team that
ﬁnished 11-1 and ﬁfth in the nation
last year.

PLANS FOR PHASE II
OF A MASTER PLAN

Plans for Phase II of a
master plan to renovate the
Field House were announced by
University ofﬁcials last week.

Phase II includes installation
of a third basketball court,
increased seating capacity to
handle 10,000 fans and opening
of new women’s locker room
facilities in compliance with
Title IX.

The Pitt Golden Panthers
have pledged $100,000 to the
University for the project.

flight (well, maybe middle—f1ight) college basketball
facility will begin to be realized this summer.

‘"§1\nother floor is to be added, as will be additional

seats and locker rooms . . .

ball coach Jackie Sherrill, who still can’t figure out
what a Pitt football team would have to do to fill Pitt

Stadium at a time when the basketball team is asking
for——and getting——more seats . . .

 

1/ It has been reported in print that Pitt could lose
Darrell Gissendanner, the first guard signed by Tim
Grgurich this year, to the baseball draft. It also has
been reported, by local baseball folk, that worry
about that is much like me worrying about how much
to sign for when the Sixers draft me as George

The Pittsburgh, Pirates were
losers on the road in 1977, but
Manager Chuck Tanner ﬁgures the
law of averages is ‘on their side in
the first major road trip of 1978.

‘ ‘I think we're going to have a real
good road trip,” said the over-
optimistic Tanner, who’s arithmetic
includes a recovery for slumping
leftﬁelder Bill Robinson.

The Pirates were idle yesterday in
advance of a 13-game road trip to
the West Coast and Montreal after a
weekend series with the Los
Angeles’ Dodgers at Three Rivers
Stadium.

In winning two. of three Dodger
games, the Pirates nearly matched
their total 1977 win output against
Los Angeles in three days.

They were 3-9 against the
Dodgers a year ago, and all three
victories were recorded at home.

Indeed, when the Pirates were
winning enroute to second place in
the National League East last
season, it was generally at home.

Pirates Hit Road To 5

The club's record was 58-23 at home
and 38-43 in other cities.

“Last year we played .700-
something at home,” said Tanner.
“We haven’t played that well at
home this season, so I think we'll

The uncommon happened Satur-
day as Pitt (11-15-1) and Penn State
(15-4-2) played to a 4-4 tie in the
second game of a doubleheader at
Trees Field Penn State
won the ﬁrst game, 15-10, behind a
20-hit offensive display.

With the score tied, 4-4, and one
out in the top of the 11th inning,
Penn State had the bases loaded
and Kerry Brown at the plate
waiting for the _payoff pitch.

Deciding that he couldn’t see well
enough, the home plate umpire
called the game because of
darkness.

Pittsburgh is 8-7 at Three Rivers

so far in the still-young 1978 season,
and 4-5 as a traveling team.

‘‘I think everybody is starting to
get more relaxed, getting in‘ the

groove of playing,” said Tanner,

Panthers Tie Lions A fter SI

The tie became official and the
complaining started.

“First our bench started com-
plaining, then they (the Lions)
started,” Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis said. “It was a terrible way to

‘end a baseball game.

“In my 24 years of coaching
baseball, I don’t think I’ve ever
been involved in a tie game, at least
not one like this.”

V Lewis said he talked after the
game with “one or two” Penn State
players who thought the payoff
pitch was a strike.

Penn State had a 4-3 lead in the
seventh when Panther Art Bortnik

hed Losers’ Label

whose team was third in the
National League East after’ Sun-
day’s games.

Robinson is one player who
ﬁgures in Tanner’s optimism. After
a slump that took his average from a
high of .318 April 15 to a low of .238

ugtest

hit a leadoff home run to send the
game into extra innings.

The ﬁrst game wasn’t-nearly as
controversial as the second. Penn
State, trailing, 4-3, took advantage
of a four-run third inning to take the
lead for good. The Nittany Lions
belted ﬁve home runs in the game,
three in that decisive third frame.

PITTCHES: It was Penn State’s
second tie of the year...Lewis
marveled at the way the Lions hit.
“l’ve never seen a team hit the ball
as well as they did on Saturday,” he
said...Mark Stevens, hitting in the
lead-off spot for the Panthers, had
eight hits in 18 trips to the
plate.

SHEDIAAVH

S

May 7, Robinson is hitting again.

“All he has to do is relax,” said
Tanner. “Bill is so concerned he’s
trying too hard.”

Robinson was hitless in four
games before the start of the Los
Angeles series. He was two for
three Sunday, and raised his
average to .253.

The Pirates’ ﬁrst stop on the
West Coast is a three- game series in
San Francisco, where they won only
one of six games last year.

Next, they travel to San Diego for
four games. Pittsburgh was un-

beaten in six games on the Padres’ t
I

home field in 1977, but is two It.
three at home against San Diego
this year.

The final West Coast series is in
Los Angeles, where the Pirates lost
six games in 1977.

After a day’s rest, the club travels
to Montreal for its ﬁrst meeting with
the Expos. Pittsburgh was 5-4 in
the Quebec city last year.

Bullets Win,
Denver Fouled
in Playoff Tilt:

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—The
super-studded Philadelphia 76ers,
touted as the best team money can
buy, appear to be coming apartat
the seams like a cheap pair of pants.

“We just lost our composure out
there,” forward George McGinnis
muttered after the Sixers blew an
11-point lead over the Washington
Bullets yesterday and lost 121-105.
“We had opportunities on the
break, but we made errors. We had
people open, but we lost the ball,
threw it away.”

McGinnis’ partner at forward,
Julius Erving, added, “It loci‘

Tglum. It’s all uphill now.”

Now trailing the Bullets 3-1 in
their best-of-seven National Bas-
ketbal,LAssociation semiﬁnal play-
offs, the Sixers must win at home
Wednesday night to stay alive.

“I’ve been down once before like ,

this, with the Nets in 1975,” Erving
said of his old American Basketball
Association team. “But that club
didn’t have the potential this one
has.”

Lately, however, the Sixers have -
been accused of feuding more than
playing team basketball.

For example, Darryl Dawkins
kicked over a chair during a timeout
yesterday and argued with M;‘Gi*
nis over an offenisve pattern;

‘‘I could see them talking
back-and-forth. . .You know, bicker-
ing,” said the Bullets_’ Mitch
Kupchak. “I wouldn’t like that if I
was on their team.”

Ofﬁciating was the‘ dominant
topic among the Denver Nuggets
after they lost 121-111 to the Seattle
Super Sonics here Sunday. It
squared their National Basketball
Association playoff series at 1-1.

“I thought we had control of the
game early, but we got into fit
trouble,” said Denver Coach L-”ry
Brown. “We couldn’t estaklish
anything. We weren’t getting to the
line enough.

“We tried to take the ball to the
hoop and I saw bodies ﬂying—but
we just weren’t getting the calls.

‘ ‘I told the refs that I was ‘tired of
this crap.’ That’s how I got my
technical. Referee Ed Rush would
have been tired, too, if he had been
sitting where Iwas. All our big guys
had four or five fouls.”

It marked the second straight

game the Nuggets were whistled for

a rash of personal fouls. In 
series opener Friday night, Seattle
went to the line 62 times and hit a
record 47 free throws. Sunday the
Sonics hit 35 of 49 to Denver’s
modest 21 of 26.

They're afraid the
