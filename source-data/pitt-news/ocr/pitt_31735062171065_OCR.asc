The Cultural Enviironmentj Pro-
gram (CEP-) is a newly-approved
interdisciplinary program -that

will allow Pitt students to become ‘
‘more involved in the ever-increas-

ing recognition of environmental
problemsand crises. '

The program is under the direc- A
' tionfof Dr. Arcadi Nebolsine, as-

sistant professor“ of the Slavic
Department and executive direc;
tor of the Italian Art Land_scape
Foundation. ‘Assisting him in the
development -of . this .program
were" recent graduates Kathy
Stackhouse and Charles Kostecki.

CEP' is similar to many en-

vironmental studies programs of .
-other academic institutions, but
"according to its founders, isuni-i

que in “one every important as-
pect.” .While including the disci-
plines traditionally asociated
with‘ environmental studies’, it
takes into account_ humanistic per-
spectives as well. _ 0

_ , Dr. Nebolsine believes that this

is a "very rai-‘e..concept" and is
“a vital approach” to’ an under?
standing of man's relationship to

his environment and how he can -

better control it.

"The program is concerned not
only with conservation, but also
with the protection of landscape.
architecture,'and art treasures."
said Nebolsine, adding that there
is a "desperate need to train peo-

ple to_ protect the threatened land-' '

marks _ and. 'art' ,masterpieces. of

per attitudes toward the environ-
ment, and the training for those
students who wish to explore the

While last weekthere was a lot of speculation.

a lot of whispering in corners, today students. fac-

(of their inter-departmental conflicts and working to
get the school moving in a positive direction.

The past week, however, has broughtgtolight
several previouslyunknonw facts concerning How-

Contrary to initial reports, Howard had made
an offer to resign. In a letter to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, Howard had agreed to submit his resignat-
tion if the Chancellor brought in an outside group ,

' to ‘investigate GSPIA’s internal affairs.

Provost Rhoten Smith acknowledged that the

Communication Ctr. Feels

by MONICA CIROCCO

University budget-trimming
plans. comprising an "across the
board” six per cent figure. have
reached the Communications
Center in Hillman Library. Ac-
cording to Dr. David M. Cross-
man. assistant director of Uni-
versity Libraries, a proposal has
been made to the Provost which
involves the closing of three posi-
tions in the Center: supervisor of
instructional production, media
producer in instructional produc-
tion. and photographer in produc-
tion of graphics.

Crossman stated that the Cen-
ter’s budget is scheduled to be re-
duced from $368,265 to $323.888. A
reduction, he emphasized, of ap-
proximately 12 per cent: "We are
actually being asked to doubly
reduce . . . over and above the six
per cent figure we are to sustain."

In anticipation of the cutbacks,
Crossman said that money which,
the Center has accrued over the
past months for audiovisual serv-
ices will now be used to purchase
equipment previously planned for
next year. However, a portion of
the money will be used for audio-
visual services. He feels this is a
“reasonable kind of approach” to
take. ’

Crossman has protested the _
proposed cuts, but noted that the

Director of University Libraries I

entire library is under cutback
plans and that despite protests.

 expects the proposals to be ac-

cepted.

He pointed out, however, that
because of cutbacks, the Center
will receive more‘ “student dol-
lars” than in the past which he
feels will help. a little, but said
that library users will still feel
the effect of the budget trim.

 at Carnegie Museum

 
  

By EUGENE SANDERS

"I was always interested in
rocks,” said Albert Oswald, as-
sistant curator in Minerology at
Carnegie Museum. “I grew up
in the Rocky Mountains where
rocks are all around.”

In the~1890’s rock collections
from all over Pittsburgh were
brought to Carnegie; A bank
clerk from Philadelphia donated
three box cars full of rocks.

“Sometimes,” said Oswald,
“we get rocks from prospectors.
Some guy comes in with three
specimens of agate and wants
25 dollars for each. If I want that
price I take it, if I want lower.
I try to bargain with him.”

Oswald has done some prospec-‘

.ting himself. “The museum has
sent me to northern Canada,

Brazil, England. Sometimes I
prospect on my own around
Pennsylvania.”

“To prospect,” said Oswald,
“you have to get a general idea
of where the rocks you want are
located. Then you ask people
around the location, find the spe-
cific spot, and start digging.”

Oswald also said that you can I

tell when a rock or mineral has
been cut by man. “There’s a
white bang mark on the rock, if
it’s done with a hammer.
of course, if the surface is
smooth it was done by a saw.”

The rock collection of Carnegie
hasn’t been shown ‘since 1948
due to both a lack of money and

‘to ex—museum director Stewart
who,‘ says Oswald. "wasn't to
crazy about rocks."

A Mineral Hall is now under
construction, and Oswald is mak-
ing preparations for it.

“I catalogue the rocks, then
pick the ones that are pleasing to
the public. I look for geological

And -

shape, and large size. Then I
wash the dirt off the rock and
cut the bottom so the rock will sit
up straight.”

Some of the rare rocks are lava

.from Peru, cave pebbles, zinc

mineral, and marble eggs.

There is also a radioactive zinc
mineral which will be shown
with two geiger counters. “The
rock is not very radioactive,” said
Oswald. “If you sit on it for five
hours you might need a doctor.
If you touch it, you'll have to
wash your hands.”

Minerals which aren’t on dis-'

play are saved for the scientists
or university students who may
need them for research projects.
There is a special research col-
lection which -has minerals of
the most perfect types.

By GEORGE ZRUSTI

. It seems that women’s lib has
finally come to my own front
door——literally.

Some time back I wrote a let-
ter to a company complaining
about a certain service I had paid
for. Nothing really unusual. save

« for the fact that the language I

used was’ not threatening, andjat
one point ‘was even complimen-

tary.

There was just one small thing.

I did not know the name of
the person in charge of customer
relations, but I still had to put
a salutation on my complaint.

So I followed a common prac-<
tice of mine and took the path
of least resistance. The salutation

— was “Gentlemen: 

uperior, while subjectinganother race to mass inferiority complexes, ~ -

It was quick and easy, and ap-
pealed -' to my own, chauvinistic
male tendencies: . ‘ ‘

The snag came when I receiv-
ed the reply. The reassuring let-
ter was signed by-you guessed
it—a‘woman.' ' '

I hope some liberated woman
informs me how to cope with the
problem ' of the unknown- addres-
see. With my luck, if I were to
head a letter ‘_‘Dear N_Iadam:”,

I would find out that “madam”
was a 250-pound ex-Marine drill
instructor who doesn’t like his
masculinity questioned.

Perhaps my sin against femin-
ism can be absolved on the
grounds that lately I've been
trying to temper the chauvinist
in me. In my writing I use “per-
son" more often, and I try to
accompany references to anony-
mous “he‘s" with “she's“.

Iladmit that I still wince when-
ever I see the clenched fist sym-
bol inside the circle-and—cross.
but I’m working on eliminating
that reaction. I have tried clos-
ing my eyes with a-fair degree
of success. ‘

Granted. I‘m not yet doing.

much for the femalerights cause.
However, when ‘I consider how
opposed I am to the movements

loudmouth speakers and senseless_
symbols, I'm, surprised that I do

as much _as I am. _
. The explanation is twofold.

First of all, I am quite partial ’.

to the “meat” issuesof women’s
lib, like equal -pay and equal

-opportunity. I’ll accept my cru-

sader medal later, please.

Secondly, I saw a movie in ‘my
childhood that had a .profound.

    women's Lib TookA ciantsiep

though belated. effect on me. It
was a science fiction film about’
a 50-foot tall woman. Bigger than
lifeasitwere; '

My little soul was struck with
terror, but I didnt know why.
Only later. when I began to un-

derstand life, did  know.

As it stands, women dominate
men even though most females.
are about 1/5 the size of the mov-
ie female. When I saw health
charts in grade school that gave
girls a height and weight advan-
tage over boys, I began to worry.

And with reports that succes-
sive generations of Americans
are growing taller, the threat of
legions ofi50-foot women became
too much for the brain. Give

them their rights now before they '

really get mean.
The movie,’ for all its signi-

'__ficance, ‘has probably been over-.

looked by the women’s liberation
crowd. Made in the latter half

.of the 1950’s,' the film“about a’

truly dominating female’ was un-

_ doubtedly a giant step forward for

sex equality. b

With all of this in mind.‘ I_-ap- _
‘ologize to the lady I wrote‘ to as

a "Gentlemen”.

“I know that some smaller col-

over the last five years. Caught
in the squeeze. farm owners sell
out to developers—and more land
becomes concrete. '

To relieve the burden. the leg-
islature would be given the right
under the amendment to enact
laws that will tax farmland at
different rates than other land.
The constitution before required
that all land taxation be uniform.

While there was little contro-
versy over the amendment, a

battle is expected over legislative '

attempts to implement it.

One reason is that similar laws/
in some other states-27 tax farm-
land differently—have turned into
a land speculators‘ dream and
have done little to stop the en-
croachment of suburbia on
farmland.

Bills already introduced in the
legislature would tax farmland
on its value as a farm and not as
a potential commercial develop-
ment site.

Another reason for opposition
is that any tax break given to
farmers ultimately means high-
er taxes for nonfarmers. A‘ study
of a 9-year-old ‘New Jersey law
found it shifted. an additional
$48 million in property taxes from
farmers to nonagricultural land-

 /"Non-spiritual meditation was discussed in lectures at Pitt last
',eek~byVJohn Allon, a teaching representative of The Students In-
ernational' Meditation Society. The lectures were a prelude to a
‘ itirse which is available from the Society.

_'lDefined, transcendental meditation is a non-religious, systema-

fifacti-ice is different from other types of meditation because it does
of‘ involve any control over the mind. According to Allon, the medi-
tation’ involves two daily sessions of 20 minuteseach which results in
hanges of the human physiology. This has been tested and proven
 many research corporations, including the Scientific American.

.Th_epchanges are lowering of the heartbeat rate, changes in the
reath rate, increased activity in brainwave patterns, and a decrease
m_—skin sensitivity. Apparently, these physiological and psychological
hanges, which occur during the meditation period, result in‘ in-
reased aesthetic analysis of the familiar wqrld.

Cigarette smoking is going un-
derground although it may be
less harassing to try to kick the
habit than to find places where
one can smoke in private.

So says Jacquelyn Rogers of
Phillipsburg, N.J., a heavy smok-
er for 22 years, who is helping
other smokers to resist cigarettes
using a program she had devis-
ed for herself.

The California legislature, for
example, is considering a- “l973
Nonsmokers’ Bill of Rights”
that would establish nonsmoking
areas in public buildings.

“Smoking became a cultural

‘ thing and it has come full circle

—— it is~no longer considered nice

, to smoke. Many people, especially

intellectuals, are going to great
pains _to conceal their identity

with cigarettes — even hiding‘
.them in other people’s desks,”

Rogers learned in conducting her
seminars for Smokenders, .the
organization founded five years
ago by her and her husband Jon.
a dentist.

Housewives often are heavy
smokers because they are more
successful in squeezing in smok-
ing time at home, and they are
likely to find it harder to give
up than most smokers, she ex-

plained...

garde “if such a thing can be
said to still exist.” _

"We see the magazine as not a_
goal in itself, but the vehicle,’’
concluded Marhoefer, “by which
at the end of the year perhaps
someone should be able to do
some ‘minor surgery on the state-
ments like “Pittsburgh is a city
more interested in working than
in protesting.”

Rogers has worked with more
than 1,800 people and she has
given additional training to stud-
ents who have helped another
6,000 in seminars conducted in
the Northeast, although now they
are expanding to other states
and a chapter has been formed in V
Arizona.

"Smoking is more than a nasty
little habit,” she remarked.

"A number of students say they

continued after several heart
attacks and warnings by doctors.
They simply couldn’t stop. In-’
volvement may bephysiological.
psychological, automatic and so-.
cial. But it can be dealt with. .”

A significant test for cut-off
potential that might be tried at
home is this one: Go 5 or 10‘
minutes without the usual ciga-
rette-and coping with the delay-
ed action may put you on the
road to ending the habit. '

“But one shouldn’t feel sorry
for oneself eyeing cigarettes and
watching the clock during the
time the urge is being delayed.
Self-pity must be avoided. The
‘person should do something-—'
play with _the dog, play a re-
cord, clean out a drawer . . .” -

On one occasion she added in
class . . or take a shower. . 
but one man rose to say that he
always had to smoke in the
shower.

-That is why one of the first
aims of the smoking seminars
is “to break the conditioned re-
sponse.” They find out what trig-
gers smoking — answering the tele-
phone, applying makeup-, drinking
‘cocktails or coffee.

Some people must have a ciga-

' rette and coffee the moment they

get out of bed. Many have told
her they drink quantities — 30
cups for one man — of coffee
because it makes cigarettes taste
better.

Others think they smoke be-

A cause it makes the coffee taste

better. For some winning the
cigarette battle has helped cut
the intake of coffee.

Some students do not realize

what triggers their heavy smok-

ing until they chart the course
of eating, smoking and drinking
habits in a day. After that the
problem, is more easily tackled

and delay periods can begin.
Rogers explained.

“For example, a man may not
realize he is driven to smoke at
certain times by frustrations. He
may smoke more at home ‘my
mother-in-law lives with me’ or

he may smoke more in the office A

‘I work with the boss’s son and
I don’t like him’.”

Highly successful people often
feel they cannot do a good job
unless they are fortified by cig-
arettes, she says. And creative
people often correlate their art-
istry with cigarettes. When they
cut off they are quick to find the"
opposite is true, she says.

On the other hand people who-

work with their hands do not
smoke as much as they think they
do. For one six-pack-a-day hair-
dresser it was merely light up
and let burn out, the chart re-
vealed. '

The course concentrates on po-
sitive aspects of cut-off‘; . . the
satisfying feeling of improving
one’s self image, she remarked..
The 35-to 45-year age group is
the most -receptive and best moti-

. vated ‘to the program because

“they are just beginning to no-
tice their vitality is ebbing on the
tennis court and /in the swim-

.ming pool. . .”

A youthful—looking earnest wom-
Rogers is sympathetic to
the pangs suffered by her stud-
ents. She had tried every method
of quitting cigarettes including
psychiatry and hypnosis. . ’

She_wasn’t even fazed by the
laboratory horror pictures of the
lungs and digestive system
brought home by her husband,
she says. But when her children
were teenagers — three are now
in college, and one is 12 — she
began researching every availa-
ble.book and pamphlet on the
subject.

She finally found ‘out why she
smoked — “it just made me feel
more comfortable.” She didn’t
enjoy it, she says, and she began
devising her program of self-

 Act of “Tristan and Isolde’’, '

William Steinberg, Music
Director, returns to conduct the
final concert of the 1972-73 Pitts-

The concerts star soprano Eileen
Farrell, tenor Jon Vickers, mez-

zo—soprano Brigitte Fassbaender’

and Ara Berberian, bass, in an all-
Wagner program.

Dr. Steinberg, internationally
acclaimed as an authority on
Wagnerian interpretation, has
selected a concert of excerpts
from three operas. The program
begins with the entire Second

featuring _Vickers ‘as the hero
' Tristan, Farrell as his lover Is-

Marke, Isolde’s husband.
Fassbaender will sing the’ role
of Brangaene, Isolde’s maid who
aids the lovers to arrange meet-
ings. Robert Calvert will port-
ray Melot, a friend of King
Marke’s who, when the lovers
are discovered, kills Tristan to
avenge his king. '

For years Farrell had resisted

Cries--Dark Flowing Stream

as well as physical responses, but
I could not apply a general mean-
ing to connect all the scenes.

Next, I thought Bergman had
failed. He has the writer, direc-
tor, and producer did not pro-
vide me with enough informa-
tion or dialogue to build a cen-
tral theme or meaning.

Then, I was advised to read an
article in the October 21 issue
of The New Yorker. In a trans-
lated letter addressed to “My
Dear Friends”, Bergman talks
about Cries and Whispers as the
“movie we’re going to make to-
gether.” ‘

He says, “As I turn this pro-
ject over in my mind it never
stands out as a completed whole.
What it most resembles is a
dark flowing stream—'—V faces,
movements, voices, ‘gestures,

lights,-shades, moods, and dreams.

Nothing fixed, nothing really
tangible other than for a mom-

ent and then only an illusory _

moment.”

= This article relieved my an-‘

xieties. It meant that neither
Bergman nor I had failed, but
we both had succeeded. I, as
a member of a movie audience,

had sensed with -Bergman the

same “dark flowing stream” in
the cries and whispers of bitter-
ness, insolence, frustration, and
agony of his four main,charac-
ters.

The audience visually senses
this “dark flowing stream” in the
setting of the 18 century mansion
and garden and in the costumes
worn by the women. Reds, white,
and black are the only colors
used to create an evocative atmos-
phere. ’

Bergman explains he used red
for all the interior scenes be-
cause, “since my childhood I
have pictured the inside of the
soul as a moist membrane in
shades of red.”

The four women playing three

sisters, one who is dying, and a I

maidservant, are Swedish actress-
es. Live Ullmann is the one most
known in America, but that does
not mean her performance in

H Cries and Whispers is superior.
In fact, all the women were ex- '

cellent.

,   Errors Ho

By JOHN SMITH
Arts Editor

This season. the Playhouse has
seen its very good times and its
very bad times. With the opening
of Shakespeare's The Comedy of
Errors, it sees its mediocre times.
and it is usually these times that
turn out to be the worst times of
all. A

This undertaking. directed by
Dr. Maria Ley—Piscator. sheds
little new light on the produc-
tion of Shakespeare. The so-
called modern techniques em-
ployed have become cliched.
No. it is -not that any points of
the play are particularly offen-
sive. and this just might be where
the problems lie, as a little of-
fense might have been used to
spice up an otherwise drab show.

The opening of "the play isla
lively little frolic, with all the
players dancing from the entrance
of the theatre ontothe stage,
singing and evoking a generally
happy, comic atmosphere. A nice
beginning for the show about to
begin—-nice but . . . . So, with
that as the beginning, the twin

,Dromios proceed to introduce
the actions about to take place.
They explain that it will be in
the tradition of Plautus, so, let the
action begin. ‘ '

—Hum of Playhouse

If you don't know the story. it
is basically the same as many
of the Shakespearian comedies-

mistaken identity, romances with «

the wrong men pursuing the
wrong women at the wrong times.
and some general drunkenness
and letchery thrown in for good
measure.

OK. this is the stuff that
comedy is made of. or at least ac-
cording to Shakespeare. But just
how far can any acting troupe
pushit? ‘

Within the last year or so, I
have seen three Shakespearean
plays produced here in the city.
Every one of them have been
comedies. The first was the Ox-

ford "and Cambridge production

of As You like It. Excellent.
The second was Twelfth -Night
done by the CMU Theatre De-
partment. Here was one that was
so poorly done that I walked out
halfway through.

So now the Playhouse has jump-
ed on this comedy bandwagon and

given nothing exceptional as far .

as innovation goes.

The staging was done inithat:

primitive—bare type style which
has become standard for today‘s
Shakespeare, with Elizabethan
costumes. There is a point where

this type of set
doesn’t show originality, but
seems to be a lack of anything
better to fill its place. This is
what has happened here.. The

construction 

costuming however was good for

what it was.

The saving graces of the show
were some very good perform-
ances by the students at Point

‘Park. Notable were the two Dro-'

mios—Randy' Zotter and David
Novich. Also well cast were the
two Antipholus parts, played by
John Danielich and Janus Pur-

ins. All did their best to throw‘

some zest into the show.

So. I want to end this fairly.

mundane review of a mundane
play with a plea. That is, Shakes-
peare has so much more to offer.
and the field of hisgreatest dra-
matic achievement as well as his
greatest entertainment lies not in
his comedies, but in the tragedies
and histories. I've had his hum-
or shoved down my throat, in too
many unpleasant forms to
this annoyance escape comment

-\j

let- ’

any longer. I_ want more Shakes-l

peare, Shakespeare showing us
the deepest parts of menssouls.
Light Shakespeare could just as
easily be Neal Simon. and Sim-
on isfar easier to understand.

is our greatest aid," explained ‘Banner. "One coach will tell
another about the track meet at. Pitt, and ask if he’s going: and
soon I receive another call asking for an invitation.” ,

‘-Banner picked’ a perfect -time to schedule a meet of this

type. “The entire .rr_ionth~ of April is_ relays, and most,track;peo-_

ple are sick of ‘relays by now. Besides,'"it gives-_them a good

BALTIMORE (AP) — Trainer
Buddy Delp wouldn’t go out of his
way to run Ecole Etage against
Secretariat, but he thinks the con-
ditions are ripe for a shot at the
Kentucky Derby winner in Satur-
day‘s $150,00-added Preakness
Stakes. —

"I’m not kidding myself," Delp
said Tuesday at Pimlico Race
Course. “Secretariat is a super
horse, and probably Sham is; too.
Although we’re looking for a mir-
acle, we are not conceding any-
thing.”

Ecole Etage was projected into
the Preakness picture when he

won the Preakness Prep last Sat-

urday in 1:42-1/5, the fastest 1-
1/16 mile clocking of the current
Pimlico meeting.

/

“He had to win the Prep to even
consider the Preakness,” Delp
said. “But after that impressive
performance and because of the
small field anticipated, we had to
go.”

The expected field for ‘the 98th
running of the Preakness remain-
ed small Tuesday, despite the
addition of Our Native, the third-
place, finisher in the Kentucky
Derby, and two longshot local en-
tries: the Lark Twist and Deadly
Dream. Our Native finished 101/2
lengths behind Secretariat in his
record-breaking Derby perform-
ance. I

The Lark Twist, owned by Lar-
ry Boyce, a wealthy Baltimore
man, has earned $5,262 while win-
ning one of 14 starts this year. He
was sixth in a 1-1/16 mile allow-
ance race at Garden State on
Monday.

Deadly Dream from the Wide
Track Farm of Frederick R.
Menke of St. Michaels, Md., has
won four of nine starts this year
including the Allegheny Stakes
and the Militia Handicap at Lib-
erty Bell. In his last start, the
2,000‘yearling won a 1/16 mile
allowance at Penn ‘National on
May‘5.

With Cup Bearer out of the
Preakness and headed instead for

finishers Secretariat, Sham, and
Our Native, plus Torsion, Ecole

‘Etage, the Lark Twist, and Dead-

ly Dream.

With seven starters, the Preak-
ness would gross $193,400 $130,-
000' going to/the winner.

Ecole Etage, running for the
Bon Etage stable of Baltimore
real estate developers Robert and
Harry Meyerhoff, can be expected
to go for the lead at the start of
the 1-3/16 mile Preakness, '

"It looks like we could be the
rabbit in the race,” Delp said.
“But that could be up to Pancho
Martin—he has a fast horse Sham.
Going out front is all right with
me. My colt likes to run that
way.”

Delp, noting that Ecole Etage
ran sixth on an off track at Pim-
lico April 28, and wasfifthon the

Woodlawn Stakes on May 5, said
he was hoping for a fast track on

   lcemen Maul Tigers,

by ROBERT MACK
Associate Sports Editor

Five different players shared
the scoring honors as the Pan-
thers brought their summer hock-
ey record to 3-1 by defeating the
Tigers, 5-1. Monday night at the
Alpine Ice Chalet. A week ago the
skaters lost a 2-1 decision to the
Washington Indians with only six
players and a goaltender to han-
dle the entire contest.

On Monday night. however. the
Panthers rebounded from that de-
feat to trounce the Tigers for the
second time this season. The Pan-
thers came out on top of a 9-0
score in their first meeting. '

Joe Testa got things rolling
midway through the first period
when he fired a shot from 20 feet
that beat Tiger goalie Ed Dyck.
Dan O’Shea put the Panthers out
in front to stay with a goal only

minutes after Testa‘s tally. It
looked like another walk away
for the Panthers but Gus Kyle
brought the Tigers to within one
in the dying moments of the first
stanza. '

Kyle came in on the left wing,
one on one with Panther defense-
man Al Moidel. He cut for the
boards to draw Moidel out of posi-
tion but then cut back across the
ice and fired a shot from 15 feet
that beat Panther goalie Bart
Mack along the ice on his stick
side.

Whe the second period started.
it was once again obvious that the
game would only turn out to be a
"bean boiler." that is, just one
period of close competition. Brian

like it at the time. Play was quite
ragged and the Panthers were

Tiger blue line when Testa picked
up a loose puck and squeezed
through the Tiger defense to deke
