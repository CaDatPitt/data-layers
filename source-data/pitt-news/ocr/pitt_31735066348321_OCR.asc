“There ain’t no such thing as a
free lunch," the famous “Freid-
man's Reiteration" of economics,
is an accurate summary of -Dr.
Milton Freidman’s discussion of
the causes and cures of inﬂation at
Pitt last night.

Speaking for the annual Alex
Walker Lecture at David Lawrence
auditorium,‘ the University of
Chicago professor and economic
expert stressedthe sole solution to
inflation as a cutback in govern-
ment spending and ‘ printing of
money. ‘i , A i -

According to Freidrnan, the

immediate resultsof suchfa policy

would be a mini-recession, with its
encompassing unemployment and
decrease in production.

"There has never been a
long-continued inﬂation ‘without a

, are all scapegoats.' .

rapid increase of the quantity of
money relative to production
output," Freidman said, “no other
economic theory is supported with
such a quantity of’ empirical
evidence." . .

“The consumer price level ha
always danced to the tune of the
quantity of money,” he said._

To overcome inﬂation. according
to Freidman, the amount of money
available for spending should be
decreased, the US Treasury must
"put its foot on the brake,"

The US has experienced several
cycles of inflation and related
recessions over the last decade as
political pressure forced govern-
ment into increased spending,
resulting in spiralling increases in
costs and incomes.

“inﬂation before the Civil War
was caused by the discovery of gold
in California, but now we’re off the
gold standard} Nowadays, inflation
is made in Washington and
nowhere else.

“Of course no government wants

to take the responsibility. We have ‘

been blaming inflation on the Arab
oil sheiks. labor unions, , and
grasping business men, but these
Govei'nments‘ generate inflation
for several reasons. one being
political pressure to spend money
on projects for special interest
groups‘, Freidman explained. ‘ t
‘iln our capacity as citizens we

told Washington to spend more,
’ but we also said not to raise taxes.

Inﬂation is a form of taxation
without representation, no con-
gressman has to stand up and say
‘I'm for inﬂation.’ "

“l’ve calculated that in 1973 the
government got a minimum of 25

of _ hidden taxation.’ ’ .- ‘

 Applause rose from the audience

when Freidman stated the big oil

. companies had not bencﬁtted from

inﬂation.

brought to this country," Freidman
stated.

In an inflationary economy many
people benefit, such as home
owners, and some people lose. It is
when the rate of inﬂation changes
that we get the problems,” he said.

Tarr listed the handling of

Police as an example of officers‘
limited rights. _ “The procedure is
completely unconstitutional," he
said. “You get a letter stating
you've been terminated for conduct

unbecoming a police officer. They.

Tarr also maintained that “super-

rules and procedures, but when
you take away the officer's
discretion, if he can't do what he

the parents, not the students; some
parents don’t want their child to
know what they make.”

Student status is acquired when
the pupil starts attending classes,
Bowen commented as he clariﬁed
who was covered by the new bill.

Bowen discusses University
efforts to implement the legisla-
tion. “Offices t-hat maintain

records should set up specific
_ times’ when students can see their
"§,).~.-tiles,” he suggested.

if Students could sign up at any time
for the specific hours under the
system which Bowen maintained
would prevent problems caused by
' numerous requests. The legisla-
tion provides the University with 45

days to comply with requests.
The Buckley -Amendment, an
addition to the Elementary and
Secondary School Act, was moti-
vated by vocal parental objections
to experimenal governmental
teaching programs that involved a
questionnaire‘ touching on the
student's home life and racial and
sexual attitudes noted an August 2

F'~‘;,\New York Times story.

nu/"g

- Buckley also thought civil rights of‘
parents and students were violated
in denial of the access to their
records that was granted to
organizations. .
Thelegislation provides that:

—-federal funds will be withdrawn
from any institution denying
students the right to see their
official files and records;

--students may request a hearing
to challenge allegedly inaccurate
contents of their record; 1

--personal information may be
released without the student's
assent only 1) in connection with
applications by the student for
financial aid 2) to other institutions
where the student has applied for
admission 3) teachers and school

officials with valid educational
concerns 4) to government
agencies auditing federal pro-
grams.

Bowen observed unclear language
in the bill has created problems.
“Assurances have been given by
Buckley's office and HEW that the
difficulties will be ironed out with
guidelines and amendments.

“The legislation was intended for
secondary schools and didn’t
address itself to young adults,”
Bowen said.

On December 3, Senator Buckley
and Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI)
revealed they would offer amend-
ments to the new legislation. The
suggested alterations aim to
restrict student access to parents
ﬁnancial statements and insure the
confidentiality of letters of recom-
mendation filed before the law took
effect.

(Continued from Page 1)
Popular support of a cure for
inﬂation, which must include cuts
in federal spending, a check on
economic growth, and decrease of
money available to the public, is
not forth coming in the immediate

. future, Friedman stated.

“Inflation is perfectlycurable, but
I doubt we have the will-power to
cure at the moment. In time,
however, Ibelieve we will generate
It.

“The reason we do not have the
will is because inﬂation is like
alcoholism, the good effects come
first, and the hangover comes the
next day. i

.“But when you try to cure
alcoholism, when the alcoholic tries
to dry out, the bad effects come
before the good. -A

“When you start inﬂation there is
a euphoria, an economic boom.
The initial effects of an inﬂation
cure is recession.

“What it comes down to is a
choice, unemployment without
inﬂation or unemployment with
inflation.”

Freidman suggested continued
inflation in this country could be
postponed by measures such as
wage and price controls, which he
described as “political" in nature.

However, the inevitable results of
the wage‘-price controls is contin-
uing, creeping inﬂation, “which
eventually explodes, the economist
said.

“They (wage and price controls)‘

can repress the symptoms ,-of

inﬂation _for perhaps a year and
half. Some politicians might want
to buy that much time.”

Tanaka in Japan and Heath _ in
England were both deposed be-
cause they represented the inﬂa-
tionary-style of economic politics,
according to the economist. A
The change will‘ come with a
revisionof American fundamen-
tals, one of these being the public
conception of government as God,
Freidman said. '

AFree Press at Pitt? C

_ questioning of Pitt News intramural coverage policy . at
'Wednesday’s Student Affairs Advisory Committee (SAAC) meeting
borders on an infringement of the free press, and raises serious
questions concerning the motivation of the Student Government.

iPittNews‘sportseditorBartMacklmdbeenaskedtoattendthe
 Atthattime, SGPresidentMikeFin-ickandBoardmembers
‘ Keeler and Paul ‘Hertneky presented him with petitions
 intramural coverage. The paper was alsoaccused of ignoring
University sports in favor of state and national events, and the sports
 was asked to explain his priorities for coverage.

(Such a confrontation was out of place for several reasons. Most
importantly SAAC is simply not the appropriate forum for resolving
differences among students or between student organizations. The

oouncilis intended to provide an opportunity for communication among
students and administrators.

 Student Government felt they had the right to intervene in the
paper’s policies, why was the sports editor not asked to attend a
Student Government Board meeting? Perhaps, because they felt more
pressure could be exerted by holding Pitt News policies up for criticism
in the presence of several administrators including the Chancellor. In
any case, this SAAC meeting was not the time or place to change the
policies of Pitt News editors. T .

_-The selection of this meeting for a protest of sports coverage was
completely Iniiustiﬁable, since the, proper, formal clmnnels for
comnnmication with the Pitt News sports department had never been
 Student Govermnent’s creation of a public controversy out of
a matter on which the sports department had never received a single
letter from an “interested student” certainly seems suspect.

At the meeting, it was revealed that there had been incidents of
students who had signed the intramural petitions at Trees Hall under
the impression they were signing up for paddleball courts. Thi's raises
' serious questions concerning the validity of the other signatures. Yet,
., the SG members continued to defend the petitions as concrete reason
.}for a Pitt News policy change. We hope our representatives have not
fdecided that the end will always justify the means in such cases of
 dubious honesty. . ‘

But beyond the unethical means and methods to which student
:. government has stooped to inﬂuence the content of the Pitt News lies

0 set its own priorities, free from governmental pressure, then Student
Government's attempt to force an editor of the paper to defend his
 policies at a public meeting is absolutely inexcusable. Such an attempt
;’has nothing to do with student input, which we as a newspaper have
‘solicited. x ’

,, Whether or not it hides behind an impressive list of student
3;’ signatures (obtained by any method possible), the intent is coercion of
jar free press. Too had our elected representatives have not learned
enough about a free society yet to avoid embarrassing themselves in
""'this~fashion. . ‘ ‘

Apparently, the‘ University administration is bowing belatedly to the
demands of Oakland residents by moving all student programming
Q ' _l activities from the Student Union Annex back "to the Student Union.
f ThequestionofprograrmningintheAnnexhasbeen unresolved since
  the city ordered the closing of the Annex for all progrannning
>' activities’. The city, spmred on by Oakland residents contended that
. the building permit did not allow musical events such as have been
‘ held at the Annex since its opening in January. The residents also

V ‘Oakland residents have failed to take any constructive action relative
. to solving the district’s crime problem. They have not yet fomially and
 publicly petitioned city government for increased police protection, as
. ‘we have said they should. ' _
‘ . Recently, however, Student Government representatives successfully
negotiated with residents to permit prograrmning in the Annex. And
now after many months of doubt when it seemed so near to being
resolved, the Student Affairs Office is considering closing the annex to
; programming activities. "
 lheycouldhave savedagreat deal ofstudents’ time had they nnde

However, the decision has not yet been ﬁnalized. Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs Bill Markus says the change, if made,
_' would be done so the sensitivities of Oakland residents would not be
offended. Though we appreciate the concerns of area residents, their
attempts to color the Annex as the primary perpetrator of street crime
i is under no circumstances justiﬁed.
' And while we think the administration's efforts at appeasing local
.-- residents are admirable, their ﬁrst and paramount concern should be

Letters to the Editor

An Invitation
To Ca/lo Wines

To the Editor:

As students, and therefore part of
the largest pop-wine market in the
United States. we would like to
reply to the letter submitted to the
New Sun by Bart Pio, District Sales
Manager for E and J Gallo Winery.
He made several points which
require, immediate response. 1.(
When the United Farmworker
(UFW) contract with Gallo expired,
no election was held, although the
UFW made several requests for
one. The contract with the
Teamsters was signed when 130
out of 150 permanent Gallo workers

were on strike in support of the_

UFW. 2) The UFW backed a bill in
the California legislature, A-B.
3370, which provided for secret
ballot elections. The bill was
defeated through the lobbying

efforts of the California growers. .

The UFW does wish to be covered
by the NLRA, but not by the Taft
Hartley amendment which restricts
the right to boycott and provides
for “cooling-off” periods of 90
days, allowing sufficient time for
crops to be harvested and therefore
for workers to lose their bargaining
positions. 3) UFW membership has
fallen not by request of the
workers,,but because the California
and Arizona growers have signed
contracts with the Teamsters
without‘ the consent of those

. employees.

Beyond these points, however,
the fact. that Mr. Pio took the
trouble to write in the first place
indicates his concern that the
public be aware of the issues
involved in the UFW conflict with

the Gallo Winery. For that reason, ~

the Pitt Farmworker Support
Committee; invites Mr. Pio or
anyone else from Gallo to engage in

Closing the SU Annex,

a public debate with representa-
tives from the Pittsburgh Boycott
staff. We think that an open
discussion would provide a better
opportunity than would the written
word for people to get an
appreciation for the UFW and Gallo
positions.

To facilitate, arranging such a
discussionwve ask Mr. Pio to inform
us within two weeks if he or any
other Gallo representative would
be willing to participate. If we do
not receive any response, we must
assume that Gallo has something to
fear from open discussions about
its policy towards workers and that
its experienced concern for arriving

-at the truth in this matter is less

than sincere.

Abortion
irresponsibility

To the editor;

After reading the Oct. 14 articles
by Denise M. Gower (“Abortion
Rights:-- Free Choice" and “Abor-
tion Rights Coalition Rallies A-
gainst New Law") l'm assured that
those fighting for’ the right to
choose abortion are as irrespon-

appealing to students’ tastes.

Any movement of these musical events to the Student Union, though
physically possible, would have a number of limitations. First, the size
of the Pine Room is not conducive to accomodating the number of
students who nomially attend similar programs in the annex. Certain
areas in the Student Union also do not provide for the security
necessary in programming activities. Though locks could be installed’
on the Pine Room, other union areas like the Lower Lounge have
obvious security problems for technical equipment. This is no problem
at the Annex since the building, itself, can be locked to prevent any

possibility of stolen equipment. -

Before the Student Affairs Ofﬁce nukes a ﬁnal decision on this nutter
they should consult publicly with Student Government representatives

And it is for these reasons we think the Student Affairs Ofﬁce should
maintain the Annex as the center of Pitt’s musical programming

And really Christina, isn’t it some-

CAS Report
On Finals

Dear l:Llll0l'Z L

As lmals period approaches, CA5
students lace problems at“ times
with the dates and numbers of
exams. We'd like to discuss two
prevalent problems.

lhere have been times when a_

student walks into class and finds
out that his final was changed to a
new day. lie considers it incon-
venient, but doesn't know what to

_do. ‘lhere is a rule in CAS- that a

professor cannot change the date
and time of the final without the
prior agreement of the class and
the Dean. ll" a professor changes
the final without consulting the
class, report it to the Dean. If he
does have prior permission from
the class and the new time is very
inconvenient for you [e.g. you have
a job J, talk to the‘ professor about
an alternate testing time. if that

doesn't work, the Dean’s Office is ,-A’..‘_
the place to go, [917 Cathedral; '

()2-l-0481]. ,

Another prevalent problem is
when you have a number of finals
on the sameday. li.is common CAS
procedure that, when you have .3 or
more lmals on the same day, at
least one is given on an alternate
day. lhe i'irs1\lhing you do is talk to
the professor involved to see if one
will voluntarily switch the test date,
(many will). ll" not, Contact the
Dean's Office.

lhe Dean's Office will know the
extent of the problems only if

students report them, so if you'r;aa~§,

hassled, let them know. We of the
CA5 Student Cabinet hope we shed
a little light on the subject. Good
luck in December!

lo the Editor,

Fred Grimes‘ letter of December 4
is typical of the misinformed atti-
tudes of people who think they are
opposed to the goals of Feminism.

The National Organization of Wo- _

men is sophisticated enough to
realize that with equal rights come
equal responsibilities. We are
seeking both. ‘One of the most
objectional of sexist ideas is that
women are incapable of assuming
the responsibilities that have tradi-
tionally fallen on men.

 Perhaps Mr. Grimes is correct in

saying that men “need an econom-
ic advantage as long as they are
expected to pay courting expenses
and stand legally responsible fora
lamily." These are exactly the
sexist traditions that NOW is
fighting. Feminists are not sitting
around looking pretty,. waiting to
bc courted. We're asking for and
paying for dates---we're taking the
right as well as the responsibility.
And we've been fighting long and
hard in courts and legislative
ollices for legal responsibility. I
Yes, Mr. Grimes, I do pity the
poor housewife trapped at home

_/5;-.‘day after day with nothing more

interesting and challenging to do
than housework and childcare. And
I pity her poor husband, saddled

7*‘ Feminist Goals and Sexist Ideas

with the worries and toil of provid-
ing for a family single-handedly.
Feminists would like to see the
pleasures and pains of both these
roles shared by husbands and
wives. Neither partner should bear
the entire burden either of diapers
and 2 am feedings or of bills and
taxes. Nor should the joy of baby’s
smile of a child's kiss or the
excitement and fulfillment of a
career to unknown to either part-
ner. ‘

Mr. Grimes might be interested to
know that the National Organiza-
tion of Women is already fighting
not only for the rights of women,
but also for men’s rights, father’s
rights, and children’s rights, ‘just
as he belatedly recommends.

Clearly, Mr". Grimes is the one
who needs to have his conscious-
ness raised. And 1 suggest he do so
before he further reveals his ignor-
ance in .additional uninformed
statements on Feminism. Perhaps
the cure for his "sickness" would
be to stop “prattling" himself and
attend the next meeting of the
Oakland NOW—Thursday,
December 12, at 7:30 in the YIKC
Building on Bellefield Avenue.

Thank you,
Margaret A. Ellis

Responding to ROTC Credit

, Dear Sir:
This letter is in reference to the

concerning academic credits for
ROTC courses. Mr. O’Brien, in a
very strong letter points out some
“facts” in support of his stand
against credits for ROTC. We
would like to clarify a few
misconceptions he has of the ROTC
program at the University.

First, all ROTC cadets do not
receive $100 a month, only

,._.scholarship students and juniors

and seniors .\enrolled in the
program. Likewise, only scholar-
ship students have their tuition
paid [after they have agreed to
serve in one of the Armed Forces as
a commissioned officer after

- graduation, so they are not getting

a “free ride” at the taxpayer’s
expense].

Second, since Mr. O’Brien,is not
enrolled in any Aerospace or
Military Science courses at Pitt, he
is not in the position to evaluate the
“easiness” of the courses. we
invite Mr. O’Brien to enroll inone
of these courses so he might
object-ively evaluate the program.

Third, Lt. William Calley ﬂunked

out of Palm Beach Junior College in
1963. He enlisted into the Army in
July 1966 and was selected for
“Officer's, Candidate Scho/ol." LT
Calley NEVER received a'commis-
hsion through ROTC, contrary to
what Mr. O’Brien informs us as
fact.

We are very much disturbed that
Mr. O’Brien failed to research
some of his “facts” before
commenting on the ROTC program
at -Pitt. We feel he has let his
emotions make the decision in this

 case. Mr. O’Brien has been totally

unfair and incorrect in his remarks.
We, as many others associated
with the military, are appalled at

the incident at My Lai 4. This act’ '

violates the principles upon which
our country is based. But the

actions of a few men should not -be ,

P. O’Brien’

used as a general statement of
character. We are very much
dedicated to the principles of this
country, and have selected to serve

through the Armed Forces. For «

this, we do not feel that we should
be made to over-load our college
schedule /because of ROTC’s
non-credit status.

We invite any comments from Mr.
O’Brien, personally or through
correspondence, but let’s get the
FACTS straight!

Sincerely,
Richard L. Bodnar, Jr.
Greg Arseneau
David M. Lavely
Donald R. Green

Cettin g ROTC
Facts Straight

To the Editor: ,

Your recent editorial, Rallying
Round ROTC, contains ﬂightsof
rhetoric that are at least excessive.
Let me respond to several points:

1. “Issue of Pitt control...no
longer valid”--It is certainly true
that the rigidity of the l960’s has
disappeared from the current mili-
tary courses. The lesson plans are
still laid out in day by day fashion,
but deviations are actively en-
couraged in the light of special
student or local faculty interests. It
is important to note, however, that
the local faculty consists of five
captains, two majors and two
colonels who are on active military
duty and fully expecting to leave
ROTC for other assignments and,
hopefully, promotions. Those
career pressures would affect deci-
sions of any rational person--they
would surely affect’ mine.

2. *‘Violates students freedom of
choice.'..(ROTC students) suffer
immeasureably.” There are many
pay-offs for students who freely
choose_'to join ROTC. They all
receive $1,000 for each of their
junior and senior years; about 40%
of the cadets receive full tuition and
textbook expenses in addition. A
six weeks summer program brings
them another $600. For these
benefits they take one 3 credit
course each term, limited just to
their junior and senior years if they

wish. Even ﬁgured on an hourly .

basis, that is very good pay. If the
academic load is excessive, the
entire credit deﬁciency can be
made up in one spring term.
“lmmeasurable suffering” just
doesn’t seem like the appropriate
phrase. '

3. “An invalid (faculty) deci-
sion." Very few subjects which
have been considered by FAS have
been voted upon by as many as
42% of the faculty members.
Those who feel involved in an issue
are the ones who- show up to vote.
The losing side traditionally seeks
comfort by knowing in their heart

that the silent majority was with
them. Ihave done so myself. Such
conviction, however, does not in-
validate the vote.

4. “Credit was revoked as a result
of an anti-militaristic attitude.”
The military is not just ‘another
profession. It is an honorable
profession that, by its very mission,
must encourage submission to
authority, learn facility in the use of
force and ultimately prepare itself
to use weapons of mass destruc-
tion. It is impossible to imagine .
our world right now without these
professionals. They are frequent“!-

men and women of good will and?
keen insight regarding human .'
relationships, but this profession is:
antithetical to the humanitarian ‘
goals of’ the liberal arts tradition.-i . ,
The liberal arts exist in a state of ,1
tension with the military. I iseief
little need for FAS to pretend'tha‘t"
the tension is not real when, in.my‘ 7
view, that tension coupled with ‘Ida-2;
continuing dialogue is our best'‘_
hope for survival. , ;,

“Don’t compromise yourself, its
all you got," reads a sign in 205
Student Union. But. it's only half
true for. according to the people
that occupy this room four hours a
day, you’ve got them to help you
too--just A Little Helplfrom Your
Friends.

Approximately 25 student-volun-
teers who man the telephones in
205 every night from 8pm to l2pm--
ready with peer-to-peer counsel-
ling, orito refer serious cases to
professional agencies.

rather have people come up to see
them and talk.

Unfortunately, in A Little Help’s
short four-year history, some
people have not thought the
endeavour as worthwhile as it
sounds. It happens these are the
ones with the money desperately
needed to keep the program going.
Right now, A Little Help and SGB
are looking for ways to fund past
Little Help phone bills.

Four years ago, Pitt operated a
24-hour hot-line program designed
by the YMCA banked by federal
funds from MHMR [Mental Health
and Mental Retardation[ and
staffed by professional psycholo-
gists and doctors.

But MHMR wanted A Little Help
to keep detailed and extensive

records of people who called_. and
felt the group might be duplicating
services provided by the Counsel-
ling v Services.

A Little Help saw no need to
record all calls and felt itg was
important to keep all calls

confidential.

“We realized that we weren't as
professional as the Counselling
Center, but we felt our type of
help—-peer to peer—-was important
for certain situations," says Laurie
Barnett. now co-coordinator of the
group.

The money A Little Help had then
was only an emergency fund
anyhow. only to be used to get the
organization on its feet, then
withdrawn. So, all funds were
recalled. and A Little Help from
Your Friends moved from what is
now the Linen Exchange Room to
the Counselling Services; 205 SU.

Even though A Little Help is
located in the Counselling Service
room, they are not affiliated with
them, and receive help, but no
funds there. The members then
went to Student Government’s
Allocations Committee last March
for funding for additional services--
speakers for training sessions for
the members, workshops on
problem-solving, and setting up
health-testing services similar to
Student Health’s.

From then until this September, A

prove their worth as a student
activity. and to prove they are
serving a certain need in order to
win any money.

“They wanted us to prove our
uniqueness," said Samulski, “to
show how we were different from
other groups that they felt were
doing the same thing as us, such as
the City Ministries and Karma
House. We stressed how we are
the students‘ peers and that they
are more willing, many times, to
talk to people who are going
through the same problems as they
are." _

According to Allocations, it
seemed the group was stressing
how many suicide and drug
overdose calls they received as a
basis for providing that students
were calling them rather than the
other places.

“If they were handling such
serious problems, we felt that there
should be some professionals

involved, and we questioned the .

students’ responsibility in handling
these situations,” states Lorayne
Seman, Allocations Committee
advisor. '

Todd Allshouse, A Little Help
staffer, said he felt Allocations was
also afraid the group was taking
calls and seeing people that were
not students.

“If we weren't helping just
students“ they thought we
shouldn't be provided with stu-
dents’ money. '

Earthquake is a lot easier to take.-

But even if all you're expecting is
a great Hollywood extravaganza,
Earthquake is a little disappoint-
ing. The biggest mistake of the
flick is the earthquake itself. As
anyone who was ever a kid knows,
it’s_ fun to break things. And what
one wants to see in Earthquake is a
lot of destruction, all those steel
and glass monuments to modern
man being totally destroyed by
nature's wrath.

' That would have been a lot of fun,

seeing Los Angeles buildings,
freeways, etc. being ‘utterly des-
troyed. It is not fun watching the
population getting hurt and mangl-
ed. And a lot [of-the gore, like the
glass imbedded into a won1an's

some, like a tragic elevator scene,
There's a vast
difference between destruction and
violence, and the failure to realize

Outside among men where the

but here among the trolls, the

‘Troll, to thyself be enough’

well for the more ambitious and
less successful‘ Preservation.

The Hollow Crown is an anthology
of songs, speeches,‘ letters, play
fragments and journal excerpts
dealing with the Kings and Queens
of England. . John Barton, who
devised the entertainment missed a
real opportunity: the play had no

”development, it didn't reflect the

changing role of the monarchy‘ in
English life over the past millenium
+=—the play's skits existed in a
vacumn and game little sense of
the period. The only sketches that
really conveyed the tone of, an era
were the Victorian ones.
The acting was like the play:

clever but shallow. Working _with a

BY DOUG GEBHARD‘
As a

reviewing concerts for anum er of

obvious and not so obvious

reasons. One of which is I don’t
have to sit in a crowded hall and
take notes in the dark as I miss the
best solo ‘of the evening.

You see, a lot of folks don’t know
or understand what goes in
criticism (or at least in mine) so

’ quite a bit of writing gets passed

off as schlock and dismissed as bad
journalism. I want to explain how I
have gone through reviewing
elpees and show and how I'm going
to change this policy in a small way
to abide the reader and make it
easier for one to pick up a review
and know right off what's
happening. 4
I generally listen to albums for»

their production, engineering and
musical ability. Working with

Page l0—THE PITT NEWS—Frida_v, December 6, 1974

on Record Criticism

music and studying it you pick up
an ear and knowledge of “good”
sound when the engineering and
production is done. As for musical
abi1ity...well, I’ve studied and play
so I consider myself as fair a judge
as any when referring to rhythm,
tempo, chording, technique or
whatever it is to do with theory.

Therefore my pieces have come
off as an analytic approach to music
more than a generational, ﬁst--
clenching cheap shot at sounding
cook

I think these things, are important
and would hope others do too. I
must also point out that I try to gear
my reviews to everybody...getting
a feel of the concert to theory of
struc_ture...but with an admitted
bias to the academic rather than
the emotional.

Beginning in the new year I’ll
follow a policy similar to Downbeat
(for anyone who takes criticism

seriously, should read their works
for an example] pioneered by the
tremendous Nat Hentoff. They
give the albums a point value in
terms of stars. I’ve seen similar
things done with grades (A,B,C...)
and even numbers. I want to do the
same thing...it would give the
reader a visual stimulus in either a
positive or negative reinforcing
way and hence lets -the reader
decide at that moment what they’ll
read. '

I would appreciate anyithoughts
you, as readers might have
concerning how you would see it
envisioned and comments on
reviews are always more than
welcome. One mustpknow what is
going on with the readership to
accurately reﬂect the attitudes of
that body.

the end, but there’s more..."

not told exactly what the services
would entail. When they found out,
they raised the bill," ‘A Little
Help’ member Diane Linheart
explained to the Board.

After hearing the explanation of.

various ‘A Little Help’ personnel,
the Board agreed to meet the
increased expense. “We did make
a committment that we would
handle this thing, and the only
difference is that the price went up.
We’ve granted groups things
before and then when the price
went up, we still took care of it,”
SGB member Bruce Keeler said.

The Board also discussed an
additional $100 answering service
charge to ‘A Little Help‘ which has
not been paid.

man Bill Barker told the board
neither ‘A Little_ Help’ or SGB were
responsible for the bill. “It was due
to the answering services negli-
gence," Barker said, claiming the
service had been requested to
remove the phones before last
summer. I ,

The SGB had earlier agreed to
loan ‘A Little Help’ the money to
cover the $100 charge, but
rescinded Wednesday night upon
hearing Barker’s explanation.

In other business, the Board
tabled a motion to deny recognition
to Mortar Board, a honorary’
student organization, on grounds
the organization discriminated
against male students by maintain-
ing an all-female membership. The
matter wil be reconsidered later‘
when a Mortar Board representa-
tive can be present, the Board
decided.

The SGB also agreed to turn over
to a previously formed Constitu-
tional Review Committee which
would alter procedures of the SG
Allocations Committee. ,

A recommendation the SGB
secretary receive a salary-raise was
also agreed on by Board members.

where content is sacrified for
t'orm...where the awkwardness and
self-consciousness of the format
has alienated the artists from the
depth of feeling 'in their earlier
records...

Why this defensiveness...this
compulsion to minic more critically
esteemed art forms? The Beatles
and Bob Dylan, rock’s most admir-
ed artists never had to result to
artifical forms...(they could say
what they wanted in three minutes
anyway.)

1 never thought that this miasma
would affect the Kinks. Their
albums Arthur, Lola, and Muswell
Hillbillies are among the best of the
concept albums...they have a real
understanding of ‘people and mo-
dcrn life without the confinement
of a tight plot. -'

Davies...bantering with the au-
dicnce...guzzling beers...encou-
raging the crowd to- join in the

The second half was Preserva-
tion...material from their last two
records complete‘ with story, cos-
tumes and a laughably inept slide
and film show. Preservation is
about characters while Arthur,
really close thematically, is about
people. Davies acted several roles
competently but it was like seeing
his personality once removed...why
bother to use inhibiting personae
when he’s such a likeable, natural
entertainer. Preservations cold-
ness put a chill on the audience...
there was no encore. A
Most disheartening waslthe im-
pression that the Kinks played
their great old songs as a sop to the
fans...their real interest was Pre-
servation. It’s too‘bad.
Contrivance and rigidity have
replaced the qualities that make
rock special...the spontaneity...the
affinities between the musicians
and the audience. It doesn't seem
that rock stars (or ﬁlmmakers like
Stanley Kubrick)‘want to step down
to works of normal dimensions
after ambitious works...the Kinks
will probably make more shallow
Preservations. ,The world gained
another rock opera...and lost a
damn good band.

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

As everyone knows, December is
the month for drenching the public
in Christmas music, both good and
bad. I think that this time_of the
year marks some of the finest, and
some of the very worst, music of
the entire year.

The radio will test our gag
reﬂexes with such doggerel as
“The Little Drummer Boy” again.
All those old chestnuts will be
dragged out of the closet to be
roasted on the open fire for the
umpteenth time. _

The enterprising masochist can, if
he really tries, hear that much
over-worked, over-rated, and over-
done oratorio, The Messiah by
Handel, at least twenty times in the
course of this month -- each
performance worse than the last.
All in the name of tradition, of
course. Some communities have
had their annual Messiah sings
going for more years than most of
us have been around. .

Once again this year, the
Pittsburgh Symphony has opted for
mediocrity‘ in doing the same old
abbreviated Messiah instead of
something new and different. A
minor musical institution, such as
the Butler Symphony Orchestra, an
institution which can rightfully take
considerable pride in the fact that it
exists at all, can also take pridei n
presenting a traditional Messiah
every year.

Another group in town has’

attention to Georg Handel’s com-

Mood With Concert

The Heinz Chapel Choir will give
its annual Christmas concert Dec-
ember 8 at 3:00 pm in Heinz
Chapel. Admission is free.

Selections for the concert, though
featuring works from several dif-
ferent lands, will reflect the prefer-
ences of the choir’s director. Dr.
Don Franklin, whose major area of
interest is medieval, renaissance
and ‘baroque music. The major
work on the program will feature
the women of the Choir, and
harpist Paula Page in “A Cere-
mony of Carols,” by Benjamin
Britten. It is a modern composition
in medieval style, based on very old
English poetry. Page is a member
of the Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
chestra.

The concert will also feature an ’

English-version setting _of “O
Magnum Hysterium,” by Pitt Mus-

“Disaster Film":

Also, the “acting” (and I use the
term loosely) isn’t even up to par
for Hollywood extravaganzas. No

one could believe that Lomei

Greene is Ava Gardner’s. father,
and it’s hard to swallow that
Charlton Heston, 7 leading man
is in so much demand. George
Kennedy plays a cop in pretty
much the same way , that he
portrayed whatever he was in
Airport. The best performance is
from Walter Mathau in an unbilled

- bit part as a sodden drunk. His

best scene is during the earthquake
when, ignoring all the -tragedy
around him, he tries to negotiate
his drink from the table to his lips.

The film’s gimmick, Sensurround,
is really a letdown if you've ever
been to a rock concert and sat too
close to the speakers with a very
energetic bass player.

Soccer Program
Receiving Aid

, BY ANDY BEHREND _
One of my favorite people, while puzzled over a predicament, would
iinzvariiabtliy wind up uttering this statement: “Let us peruse the

'situation:. "" I
A . And! now, with football out of the way, is as good a time as any to take
a l-‘on-g... close look at the situation involving one of Pitt's more poorly
_liuin=ded’ sports, and certainly a “minor" sport. soccer.

' The good news is that more money will be pumped into the program,
an; action which will probably save soccer from dying a slow death.
_Coach Leo Bemis is pleased with Athletic Director Cas Myslinski’s
 pledge to “give a little bit more scholarship help."

No matter what amount. that means $$$. the one missing facet for a
., ' bigger. more successful program. The green could bring in the two or
‘ » three high school stars that would help the Panthers -turn their losing
ways completely around.

An alarming pattern has arisen the past two seasons. The booters
have proven they can stay with their NCAA “big program" schools
(Bucknell. Temple. WVU. PSU). but usually succumb. while defeating
State Conference teams (Gannon. Grove City. and sometimes Edinboro
and Slippery Rock.)

The proposed aid from Myslinski can do more for the squad than
purchase players. Bemis reminds the money will go to other imperative
‘needs. .

Both the home and away uniforms. jersey and pants. are shabby. The
pants look like they were worn by Civil War vets, and many of the
4‘ shirts were stolen near the end of the season; the ones that remain
have holes in the armpits.

 Also. more lights have been proposed for the stadium. enabling less
shadows for night games. Furthermore. the bulbs could help promote
. I. possible tournaments. or invitationals, drawing people but more

A importantly, adding gamesito the schedule. I

If not engaged in a night game, Bemis and the players‘ would like. to
‘see other home tilts switched from being played afte'r the football
7 games to before them. It is demeaning to have 40,000 fans exit the
stadium as the soccer game begins, a situation that occurred at
Homecoming. What fans would want to sit 5 straight hours? But people
coming to get a good seat would catch part of the soccer game, and it’d
be nice seeing more than 38 people in the stands.

All that is required now is the badly needed support of Assistant AD
Walt Cummins. and to get student government behind the team.
Cummins has a major voice in deciding when the home games will be
played. and SG support means a great deal to any University function.

lguess Bemis‘ encouragement stems from the, fact that “I was
assured of not getting any cuts in the budget." But standing pat with
the‘ same budget would have been just a_s,;fat»al_as a cut. That Myslinski
realizes this is aboon to Pitt's soccer fortlunes, and indeed a step in the
positive direction. ' I '

The 1974 Steel Bowl opens tonight if

7:15 pm and the big inter-city
rivalry between Pitt and Duquesne

Many experts feel that this year’s

ence and Oregon is expected to be
one of the front-runners. They will
come into the Steel Bowl with a 2-0
record while the Nittany Lions will
be in their first action of the
season.

The Ducks were a young squad
last year and have ll lettermen
returning from the team that upset
UCLA Sb-51. They play with
intensity showing a sturdy defense

~ and a hustling offense.

Ron Lee, a 0-4 guard who aver-
aged over 18 points last year as a
sophomore will provide much of the
Oregon offense along with 0-8

 center Gerald Willet, 10.8 average

last year. Coach Dick Harter will

Penn State, led by head coach
Johnny Back, is a mediocre basket-
ball team at best. The Lions rely on
a tough defense, which was 12th in
the nation last year, to offset their
lack of speed, height, and shooting
ability but sometimes have a
tendency to foul themselvs right

  Wrestlers Host Owls

BY G. W. STEVENS
The Pitt wrestling team will see
their first dual meet action of the
season tomorrow afternoon when
they meet the Temple Owls in a 2
pm match in Fitzgerald Field
House.
The Panthers were scheduled to
wrestle Michigan on Monday night
in Ann Arbor but the bad weather

forced a cancellation of the match.
So, the only action the Pitt squad

haspseen thus far this season was In.

The Cats won the tournament
placing wrestlers among the top
four in eight of the ten weight
classes.

Crown Defense Sunday

BY STEVE SYBERT
Fresh off an impressive tourna-

-' ment victory over Purdue, the Pitt

Hockey Club will embark on its
Western Pennsylvania Intercolleg-
iate Hockey Association title
defense against Indiana State
Sunday 7 pm at the Civic Arena.

The Panthers, 3-1-1 in exhibition
play and on a three-game winning
streak, will be running at full speed
in opening their 12-game league
schedule.

The “Goals Incorporated" line of-

Charlie Hagins, Rick Vernon and
Denny Browne have scored eight
times already with Vernon leading
the team with ﬁve tallies.

Left winger Browne ‘suffered a
bruised back in the Purdue
skirmish but, although still black
and blue. is expected to perform
against the Indians on Sunday.

Coach Len Barcalow’s skaters now

' also have a strong line to back up

their top trio. Centered by Jeff
Saunders, with Bill Gedeon and
Chuck Crisanti the wings, the
second line has knocked in five
goals for the Panthers so far this
season. ‘
Gedeon, with two goals and four

assists, shares the team scoring ~

leadwith Vernon .despite having

      
 

Jumpin” Johnny DeFazio is
playing consistently in goal with a
current 2.75 goals against average.
The Panther netminder has turned
away 79 of 90, or 88%, of the shots
he has faced and hopes to better his

' records against the WPIHA com-

petition.

Much can be said for the play of
the Pitt defensemen, especially for
Bob Arturo, John Finney, Russ

..Stump and Mark Stuart. The

excellent checking of the Panther
back-liners makes DeFazio"s job
easier to return.

Indiana State is 0-1 by way of a 3-2
defeat at the hands of Edinboro.

Top scorer Marty Sanders, a
sophomore, leads the Indians’
attack.

Face-off at the Civic Arena is set
for 7:00 pm with Duquesne and
Carnegie-Mellon completing the
college doubleheader at 9:00.

PANTHER PUCKS: Interviews by
Greg Benedetti with Pitt players
and coaches will be aired tomorrow
between the first and second
periods of the televised Penguins

also concerned Athletic Director

Pittsburgh with a 2-2 record. They
opened their season last week in a
quadrangle meet with Princeton.
Lycoming. and Montclair State.
They defeated Lycoming 19-18 but
were soundly beaten in the other
two matches. losing to Princeton
23-8 and dropping a 35-9 decision
to Montclair St. And. on Wednes-
day night. the Owls overwhelmed
the Univcrsity of Rutgers at Cam-
den 51-0. ,
temple has a young squad, much

like the Panthers, with eight of ten‘

regulars returning from last season
when they .compiled a 9-4-1 record,

. including a 25-15 loss to Pitt. But

second year coach Dave Steiler

feels his squad should show
marked improvement.
“We’ll still be young,” said

‘Steiler. “I have only two seniors on
the team and most of the boys will
be freshman and sophomores. But
most everybody has had some
collegiate experience and this will
help, especially in the Easterns at
the end of the year.” _

With his wealth of young players,
Steiler isn't sure who will be in the
starting line-up tomorrow. Three
wrestlers which are almost sure
bets to be in action are Ty Hamilton-
(134), Lou Rivera (150-158), and
Duane Daly (190).

Hamilton could be paired against
Pitt's All-American Rande Stottle-
myer in possibly the feature match
of the afternoon. The -sophomore
Owl currently holds a 2-1 record
and is a team tri,-captain. he was
injured most of last year and was
only able to record a 4-4 mark but
he is one of the most experienced
members of the squad.

Rivera is currently 3-1 wrestling at
both 150 and 1'58 where he went 6-6
last year.
weight class he will see action in
tomorrow but he will face either
Skip Bolin at 150 or Ray Dallatore
at 158.’ Bolin is a freshman who

_ The Lions must put their faith in
several returning lettermen such as
Randy Mcister, a (3-9 senior who
averaged 12.4 points per game last
year. He will get some help from
guards Tom Doaty, who played in
20 games last year while averaging

eight points, and forward Kevin"

Burkc who averaged six points last
year.

But the big game of the night is
the city-championship between the
Panthers and the Dukes. The
teams are similar in several re-
spects and the game should move

' lhe Dukes new head coach, John
Cinnicola, must have been taking
lessons from Pitt coach Buzz Ridl.

in their game against Wheeling
College on Tuesday, Cinnicola used

almost his entire squad as his,

players combined a tough defense
with a run-and-shoot offense to
gain a 76-74 win.

Oscar J-ackson, Pat Nixon, and
Rod McLane are the team leaders
and combined for much of the Duke
offense in the first game. Cinnicola
used several freshmen in the
opener and was pleased with their
performances.

Pitt is currently l-1 coming off a
loss to West Virgnina by an 82-78
score.’Pitt is the defending Steel

_Bowl champion and last year’s
championship started the Cats on
the road to the NCAA Eastern
Regional finals.

The Panthers also play tough

lom Richards, Kirk Bruce and
Bob Shrewsbury have done well so

Hill is expected to get back on the
scoring track. But the biggest story
in the Panthers play so far has been
o-7 freshman Melvin Bennett who
has shown that he can supply the
fast break with much needed
rebounds.

The Panthers badly need a pair of
wins in the Steel Bowl because with
the quality of the competition
coming up on the schedule, the
Panthers can't afford to lose to
teams like the Dukes if they are
going to return to the NCAA
tournament. But a win over
Duquesne will not be an easy
accomplishment, and a win over
Oregon in the finals could be even
tougher.

tournament and could be a big plus
for the Panthers this year. '

Duane Daly has compiled a 3-1
record thus far. He is just a
freshman and was a two-time
Pennsylvania regional high school
champion out of Milton Hershey
high school. Daly is filling a huge
gap caused by the graduation of the
Owls top wrestler last year, Lynn
Hershey (13-1), but he has ﬁlled in
nicely so far. ‘

Other possible starters for the
Owls are Randy Hamme at 118 and
tri—captain Rich Acierno another
senior who will wrestle at the 177
pound class.

Hamme was 6-6 a year ago but
hasn’t been too successful in the
opening matches. Nevertheless,
Hamme’s experience should be a
big test for Pitt’s freshman Kevin
Nellis who has been impressive in
preseason action.

Acierno is one of the top wrestlers
on the Temple squad. He was 9-4
last year although he got off to a

slow start this season. He will also
be a good test for another Pitt

' freshman, Bill Bailey.

Gary Osborne will probably ﬁll
either the 150- or 158 spot
depending on Rivera’s duties. He
was 8-1 last season including three
pins, and he is only a sophomore.

Other possibly starters tomorrow
are Chris Ianacone at 142 who was
5-3-2 last year and placed ﬁfth in
the EIWA tournament, and Dean
Sizemore, a sophomore heavy-
weight wrestler. Sizemore was
2-1-1 last season but should wrestle
much more this season.

The match with Temple is very
important from the Panthers
standpoint. Head coach Dave
Adams is counting on this match to
provide him with some valuable

and respectable hockey? I
Nobody wants to take the blame,
but everybody has to take the
responsiblity. The easiest, if not
the most obvious, place to begin
nit-picking is with the goalies.
Gary lnness was second fiddle to
the pugnacious, maskless Andy
Brown last year, and played in 20
NHL games to rack up an average
of 3.26. Brown jumped to the
Indianapolis Racers of the money-
ﬂashing WHA, and lnness hopped
into the net for Pittsburgh. _
lnness thus far has played 18 full
games, winning two of six games
on shutouts. But he’s lost nine
games, and tied three. The record
is no small cause for alarm,

considering that he’s the . guy
supposed to spearhead the Pen’s
drive for a Stanley Cup playoff in
the James Norris Division.

Coach Marc Boileau insists “The
goalie can only do as good a job as
the guys in front of him." That
dubious hockey axiom finds favor
with lnness. “When I try to cover
up for somebody else's mistake, I
tend to flop a little more. That gets
me into bad habits that are hard to
break once we're playing well."

lnness‘ flopping tendencies are a
major concern of Penguin-watch-
ers. He‘s garnering an unwanted
reputation as a “wanderer," a
goalie who plays the man instead of
the puck. following the action
instead of guarding the crease. He
admits, “I'm trying to be more
stand up than I have been."

his own troubles, and, like lnness,
offers an explanation but no justifi-
cation for those troubles. “You
start getting bad habits if you try to
change your style to adapt to
mistakes that the guys made.”
lnness refuses to characterize or
compare himself with any esta-
“I play my own
game no matter what happens."
But Johnson says he admires Roger
Crozier of Buffalo for “his spread
leg style. “It gives you a lot more
lateral mobility.‘ it works for me
because I can get up faster and
start moving. But the danger is

that shots can go between my legs

or over my shoulder. You can be
easily’ beaten on shots from the
short side."

Any goaltender has trouble doing
his job if he’s been out of the nets
for a while. Boileau has an

The Pitt invitational, tonight,
tomorrow and Sunday, will tip off
the 74-75 Women's Basketball
season. Coaches Jean Condo and
Jan Kasnevich are looking forward
to a good year.

“This is our first time coaching
college students and we’re enjoy- .—
ing the challenge,” coach Condo
commented. “We have a young
team, in fact, all but one member
for the Invitational are freshmen.
All together we only have four
veterans.”

A very competitive schedule for
the season is in store for the team
withchallengers such as Slippery

-s:

Rock, Duquesne, Frostburg and ‘sq;

Penn State. Duquesne. whom the
Pantherettes will meet in the first
round of the tournament today
have been described as "very
aggressive." and Frostburg played
in a Canadian tournament a few
weeks ago. —

What the team lacks in height,
having only one girl taller than six
feet, they intend to make up for in
spirit, hustle and teamwork.

"We have a good group, that
practice hard and show good
' said Coach Kasne-
vich. "They know one of the,ma“in
functions of a team doing well is
the dependence on one another.
We want to create a positive image
and instill pride. Executing‘ the
fundamental swell and progressing
from every game are going to be
our key objectives."

The team will play under experi-
mental rules this season. Instead
of having 8 minute quarters, as last
year, 20 minute halfs will be
introduced. Also, after the attack-
ing team crosses the halfway line of
the court, they must shoot within
30 seconds. —
Pantherette Bounces: The Invita-
tional begins at 6 pm tonight, Pitt

«and Duquesne in the first round.

Tomorrow Edinboro and _Fr0stburg
battle at 10 am and Penn State will
take on the winner of the Pitt-
Duquesne match at 11:30. A
consolation game will be played at
2:30 and a game between Slippery

“Supt-r’ ’ Steelers?  

(Continued from Page 17)

Maybe Noll’s seventh season will bring Pittsburgh its first Super Bowl
trip, but I for one just can’t see it happening this year. Of course, the
Pittsburgh defense is right’ amidst the NFL’s best, and it is defense,
largely, of which dampions are made.

But the Miamis and the Oaklands not only have comparable defenses.
but powerful offenses as well. When was the last time a Steeler QB
completed 86% of his passes in a game, like Ken Stabler did last year?
And how often does Pittsburgh score on its first possession, like Miami
seems to every damn game? i

' How long has it been since the Dolphins or Raiders were held to 84
yards in total offense, like the Steelers were last Sunday  by
HOUSTON?
Not only does Pittsburgh lack a championship-calibre offense, but
also it has the problems generated by the lack of a clear-cut number
one quarterback. I guess no one really knows what it is about
platooning QB’s that hurts a team so much. It could be mental, with
each player inwardly preferring one of the QB’s and playing more ,.
loosely and poorly for the other. It could simply be physical, with
players failing to adjust to different styles and psychologies.
But whatever it is, it’s for real, despite Noll’s claims to the contrary.
Noll is using a time-honored" explanation: that his team is in no way
bothered by the changes. at quarterback. He’s following a long line of
head coaches with similar situation: the Redskins’ George Allen
(Kilmer/Jurgensen, ’73), the Cowboys’ Tom Landry (Morton/
Staubach, .’70, the Vikings’ Bud Grant. (Cuozzo/Kapp, ’69), the
Raiders’ John Madden (Stabler/Lamonica, ’70), the Giants’ Allie
Sherman (Tittle/Conerly, ’61). A
The list goes on and on. But in fact, I was just three months old the
last time a team won a championship behind a quarterback tandem.
Bob Waterﬁeld, who was ending his career, and Norm Van Brocklin,
who was starting his, combined to lead the Rams to the 1951 title.
Yes, the Steelers will win as Noll takes hisicircus to Foxboro this
Sunday. The Pats, with receivers Reggie Rucker, Randy Vataha and
Bob Windsor out of the lineup and signal-caller Jim Plunkett at about
50%, know they need an unprecedented miracle to win the wild-card
playoff spot, a miracle that only begins with a Miami loss to Baltimore.
Pittsburgh should have little trouble. They might even beat Buffalo, if
the Bills come here for a first-round playoff.

But a playoff win over Miami or Oakland? Wait till next year. Chuck
Noll obviously has been all along.
