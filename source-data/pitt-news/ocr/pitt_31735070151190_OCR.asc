The Student Government Board
Judicial Committee came together
with members of the Board on
April 4 to hold a hearing for the
ﬁrst time since the early 2000s.
The committee adjudicated the
infraction ﬁled by Elections Chair-
man Aaron Gish against Board
President Gordon Louderback.

The jury, which consisted of
thejudicial Committee members,
voted in favor of Gish based on
the evidence presented by both
parties. The ruling declared Loud-‘
erback had “presented undue in-
ﬂuence on Chairman Gish and his.
role as Elections Chair” in viola-
tion of Article 1, Section V of the
Student Government Constitution.
Judicial Committee Chairman
Joseph Kozak said a recording
and transcript of the hearing will
hopefully be available to the public
upon request by the end of this
week. Also, a folder containing the
evidence and statements of both
parties will be available in the SGB
office by Tuesday. 9 ’

In the infraction complaint i

sent to the Judicialycommittee

~on March 31, Gish also charged

Louderbackwith attacking the
Elections Committee’s autonomy.
The Judicial Committee deemed
this portion of the complaint void
because it was in reference to the
Code of Ethics, a voluntary docu-
ment.

, While standing on top of the piano

he was just playing, Twenty One Pi-
lots’ lead singer Tylerjoseph began
clapping along to his own music,
encouraging the crowd to do the

same. The singer then proceeded .

to do a backﬂip back onto the stage.

‘ “On this very ﬁne afternoon,”
Joseph yelled, “Who’s happy to be
alive?” _

The 400 people in attendance
Sunday seemed to be just that as
they answered-with cheers during
this year’s Bigelow Bash, Pitt’s annu-
al spring concert. Aside from bands
Red Hook Winery, Twenty One Pi-
lots and headliner Neon Trees, the
festival — hosted by Pitt Program
Council — included free activities
for undergraduates, including an
airbrush T—shirt stand, a caricature
artist, cornhole and a photobooth.

On one of the ﬁrst warm days for
Pittsburgh in months, the students
were happy to ﬁnally don shorts
and sunglasses while they enjoyed
the day of free music and activities.

“These free events are always so
fun, and Pitt did a nice job of getting
a variety of acts for this year,” said
Greg DeGeorge, a freshman engi-
neering major. “And what abeautiful
day for itf’

Although the planning for Bi-
gelow Bash proved to be arduous
and started months ago, PPC under-
stands how important the event is to
the students.Junior Taylor Steffey,
the arts and ﬁlm director of PPC
who introduced the acts for the day,
said a substantial amount of plan-
ning occurs behind the scenes for
Bigelow Bash.

“You have to negotiate con-

tracts with the artists, talk to the
city about closing down the street,
renting carnival booths,” Steffey

Neon Trees lead guitarist Chris Allen and vocaiist Tyler Glnn jam during Pitt Program Cuuncii"s annual Bigeiow Bash. Sheldon Satenstein |

said. “There is so _much that goes
into planning that people ‘at Pitt

don’t necessarily know about. But"

it’s all part of the programming.”
The ﬁrst opening act, Red Hook
Winery, was the winner of PPC’s
Battle of the Bands event held a few
weeks ago. The band’s 30-minute
set started off the day and pumped

A up the audience for the acts to fol-

low.

As the day continued, more and
more students piled onto Bigelow
Boulevard to hear the bands per-
form on the stage, which took all
weekend to set up.

Those in attendancealso sat on
the benches and grass outside the
William Pitt Union as well as on the
banister of the Cathedral stairs.

V The popularity of opening act
Twenty One Pilots at last year’s Bi-
gelow Bash prompted'PPC to invite
the band back to open this year.gBy
the reaction of the crowd, the band

failed to disappoint, and its energet-
ic, 45-minute set helped to highlight
the afternoon of performances.
“No bomb threats this year,
huh?” Joseph jokingly asked the
audience, to which he received a

big laugh from students who re-

called the string of bomb threats
last spring that, thankfully for those
who attended, -didn’t disrupt the
concert.

The band proceeded to play a
mashup of cover ‘songs on a uku-
lele, involving one-audience mem-
ber who they allowed on stage to
sing a_snippet of “Call Me,-Maybe”
by Carly Rae Jepsen. The constant
jumping and bouncing around pro-

vided an exciting and lively prelude

to Neon Trees.

Twenty One Pilots ended its set
by arranging the audience into a
circle around the band’s members as

Correction: Tuesday’s story, “Student facing vandalism charges for Cathedral grafﬁti incident,” stated that the graffiti would orginally cost the University $65,000
to $100,000. That ﬁgure, recorded in the police report, was provided by Pitt’s maintenance and was not accurate. The actual cost of removing the grafﬁti is $365,

according to Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele. The Pitt News regrets the error.

HEARIN

Kozak said the code is voluntary so that
the committee can accept portions and work
to change other portions if they so choose.
Because it is a guideline, Gish’s complaint
was rejected. 1

“We can’t hold anyone to that standard,”
Kozak said. ,

Gish ﬁled the infraction as he met re-
sistance from the Board while working to
institute changes to the Elections Code
that included eliminating the mega-slate“
endorsement system. This system allows
two slates — groups of two to three stu-
dents running for SGB positions, which
can include a presidential candidate —— to
endorse each other and pool campaigning
resources. .

In his proposed changes to the Elections
Code, Gish called for a system that pro-
moted more diversity among the Board. He
expressed his concern that the Board was
primarily comprised of Druids —— members
of a secret organization that carries out
anonymous actions across campus — to
committee liaison Board member Amelia
Brause. Brause reported the comments to
Louderback, who then suggested Gish re-
frain from making such comments as they

presented bias against a particular group.
To clarify any instances of bias and de-
termine the appropriateness of Louder-

back’s response, Gish ﬁled his infraction.’

Louderback said he never intended to ﬁle
against Gish ‘as he did not have cause _to
do so.

Kozak said he decided to hear the com-
plaint because he felt the issues brought up
by Gish deserved a hearing. ,

According to Kozak’s statement, former
Elections Chairwoman Annie Brown sub-
mitted a statement and text message con-
versation between her and Gish as evidence.
Board member Amelia Brause, ‘Elections
Committee member Hans Kessler, Board
member Thomas Jabro and Board member
David Rosenthal served as witnesses during
the hearing.

Gish requested that the verdict be a
public statement as a resolution to the in-
fraction. .

Gish felt that the results of the hearing
were fair, saying that he was glad he could
get his points across to an unbiased group.

Gish believes the hearing has furthered
his resolve to fulﬁll his duties as Elections
Committee chairman.

“I think the Elections Committee is go-
ing to make some even bigger changes, and
we aren’t going to compromise,” Gish said.

The new proposed changes include elim-

inating the entire slate system and reducing
the number of votes for each student dur-
ing elections. Students can currently vote
for six of the nine Board members, includ-
ing ﬁve Board members and a presidential
candidate. ”

Louderback said in an email sent to Gish
on Sunday that he plans to continue to work
with Gish and would like to “continue [their]
momentum into the summer.”

“While I believe I was fulﬁlling mylsworn-
in duties of Student Government Board
president, I respect the Judicial Commit-
tee’s decision and will do all that I can to
address the issue,” Louderback said.

Louderback also requested the opportu-
nity to “reach out to [the Judicial] commit-

‘ tee to clear the air” and continue their roles
and relationships within the SGB oﬂice. ' '

In reaction to Louderback’s email, Gish

said, “I like that he has decided to respect _

the Judicial Committee’s decision and that
he’s willing to talk through these issues
now that we’ve had an ofﬁcial assessment of
‘them, and I understand if there’s a dispar-
ity between what he believes and what the
assessment was.” , ‘V
According to the verdict statement, the
Judicial Committee will meet as a public
tribunal to clarify the role of the Election’s
Committee chair position. Kozak currently
remains unsure of the tribunal date. I

for an impromptu drum solo that had audience
members pulling out their camera phones to
record the creative musical entertainment.

Afterthe band’s ﬁrst few songs, lead singer
Tyler Glenn grabbed the microphone and
looked out to audience. A

“This is what college is all about,” Glenn
said. A .

The band performed for about an hour,
playing hits including “Animal,” “1983” and
“Everybody Talks” while causing the invigo-

rated crowd to jump and sing along. During its -

last, and arguably most famous, song, “Every-
body Talks,” Glenn jumped into the audience
of mostly students and crowd surfed for as
long as security would allow him.

As the band continued to play, Glenn
walked around the side of the Union and

thedral. As he disappeared around the side of
the Cathedral, the 2013 Bigelow Bash came to
an abrupt, yet entertaining, end. I

THE STAMATTACK

You give me ten minutes, and I   I
make the mayoral race interesting  

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opz'nz'ons Editor

I bet you are having a really tough
time following the mayoral race.

The weather is getting really nice.
Everybody looks pretty. Without a
national pundit class to commen-
tate, it’s hard to differentiate between
candidates. To the outside observer,
it just looks like two somewhat quali-
ﬁed candidates speaking.

But right now, I would like to
make a plea to all my fellow Pitt stu-
dents. Try to stop concentrating on
the nice weather. Just read the next
paragraph. Then stop if you want. Or
keep reading — whatevenjust read
the next paragraph.

Please go vote on May 21, and
pleasevote for Bill Peduto.

I know it is very hard to under-
stand why this is important. There
is nothing sexy about local politics.
Nobody changes their proﬁle picture.
Nobody is going to tweet a picture of

’ the mayor playingwith a little kid in

the oval ofﬁce. .

Further, most elections really
don’t feature candidates with huge
differentiations. Other times, posi-
tions actually don’t matter. A race
between Mr. Red and Ms. Blue for
city comptroller probably doesn’t
deserve too much attention.

But this is different.

First of all, the mayor matters.

Mayors initiated‘ many of the
large civic projects this city enjoys
today. While a mayor might not take
part in the typical left-right politics
that are sofamiliar to today’s voters,

, an enthusiastic mayor can create and

advocate developments. Different
potential mayors will direct their
enthusiasm and energy in different

directions.

So don’t think about gay mar-
riage. This election has nothing to
do with that. It’s about ﬁguring out
which candidate has energy and
vision directed toward meaningful
projects.

Of the four candidates, two —
Jake Wheatley and A.J. Richardson
— lack the constituencies or funds
to even be competitive. Thus, the
distinction has to be made between
the two main competitors, Peduto
and Jack Wagner.

Admittedly, it is not easy for the
average voter to distinguish between
local candidates. It’s hard to judge
where you stand on issues, and dif-
ﬁcult to determine what should drive
city government.

But just spend ten minutes on the
candidate’s websites and the choice
becomes much easier.

On one hand we have leader ex-
traordinaire Jack Wagner. Wagner
comes to this election as an estab-
lished ﬁgure in Western Pennsyl-
vania politics, having served as a
councilman, council president and
state auditor general. His website,
jackwagner.org, features no speciﬁc
platforms. From what I can tell, he
hasn’t spoken much about speciﬁc
plans on the  4

Jack Wagner just sells Jack Wag-
ner. And leadership. Not just any
leadership, but, according to his
campaign website, “leadership for
our future.” And not just any kind
of this leadership, but “roll-your-
sleeves-up” leadership.

Peduto, on the other hand, comes
at the election with 100 speciﬁc pol-
icy proposals —— 100. And while no
politicianwill ever meet every prom-
ise, if he even meets a fraction of his

goals, he has the potential to change
the city in ways not seen since the
mid-2 0th century. T

Among these plans are a shuttle
service to connect nightlife destina-
tions, a commuter ferry and tech-
nological solutions to the city’s poor
snow-plow service, street paving,
parking and traffic control.

This speciﬁc vision would be key
to a Peduto mayoralty. It takes cut-
ting edge policies of modern urban
planning from other cities and tests
them in Pittsburgh. —

As a councilman, he has alread
initiated some of these projects with-
in his district in the East End. These
include variable, demand—sensitive
parking management systems and
early efforts to start a bike-sharing
service in Shadyside.

But as mayor, Peduto would have
the ability to take these ideas and
experiment on a larger scale. These

_ experiments could have as large of

an effect on our perception of the
city as Point State Park and the riv-
erfront trails.

So before you get lostin ice cream
cones and porch drinking this sum-
mer, please look at these two candi-
dates’ websites. Within ten minutes,

. you will see that the two main candi-

dates are not copies of one another.

One is a man with proven ca-
pabilities of initiating community-
transforrningprojects and reforming
government: a man who has big goals
and the ability to accomplish them.

The other is a guy whose name is
Jack Wagner. —

Please, registered Democrats
within the city, make the right de-
cision. I

GYMNASTICS

Panthers finish fifth at NCAA

Tyler Pecyna
Staff W riter

After a brief moment of praise
from the public address announc-
er, the Pitt gymnasts stopped wav-

ing their Terrible Towels and sat ‘

back on the center mat.

After ﬁnishing in ﬁfth place
at Saturday’s six-team NCAA re-
gional meet in Gainesville, Fla.,
the Panthers looked up at the host-
ing Florida Gators, who huddled
around the ﬁrst—place sign across
the mat.

The Gator gymnasts, arms ex-
tended outwardly with one hov-
ering over the other to resemble
their mascot’s powerful jaw, are
GymInfo’s No. 1-ranked squad and
will compete in the NCAA nation-
als. Minnesota, which ﬁnished sec-
ond at regionals, will join Florida
from April 19-21 in Los Angeles.

For Pitt, however, the season
ends after its 194.775 score was
not one of the top two totals at
the meet. The team’s season ends
about a month after the Panthers
recorded the third-highest mark
in school history. Coming into re-
gionals, Pitt ﬁnished no worse than
third in its last ﬁve meets.

“Our expectations were to
come into regionals, do our job,
be competitive and see where the

cards fell,” Pitt head coach Debbie
Yohman said.

The cards fell unfavorably for
the Panthers, who started the eve-
ning on balance beam.

and tumbling on a 4—inch—wide
beam is difficult enough in the
abstract. Now put that slender
platform in one of the sport’s most
intense competitions and in front
of 7,137 screaming fans, many of
whom" gestured with the gator
chomp in support of the country’s
top-ranked team.

Though the young Pitt squad
tallied just 48.2 points, the low-
est score among the six teams,

‘Yohman said she does not believe

the environment rattled the team.

“Our kids did an amazing job
holding their focus,” she said. “The
noise level and the gator chomping
was unbelievable. So we opened up
a bit rough on beam but then got
on track with the rest of the lineup
and remaining events.”

Freshman Laura Kummerle’s
9.8 score on the balance beam tied
for the 12th mark among individiial
performances. ‘

The Panthers’ night improved
only slightly, as they ﬁnished ﬁfth
in each of the remaining three
events: 48.8 on vault, 48.875 on
uneven bars and 48.9 on ﬂoor.

But even the tempered progres-
sion was acceptable for junior Kori
Macdonald, who received a 9.700
on vault.

“We were the lowest ranked
school in our region,.so to go in and
beat [Bridgeport] was abig accom-
plishment in itself,” Macdonald
said. Alyssa Adrian, the lone Pitt
senior, stood out among gymnasts
from each school at regionals.

The new “catholic league,” as some have
called it because of the religious affiliation
of the majority of its members, will keep the
Big East name and include some Big East
giants such as Georgetown, Marquette and
St. John’s. '

But it will never be the same.

tainty seems indicative of the future of col-
