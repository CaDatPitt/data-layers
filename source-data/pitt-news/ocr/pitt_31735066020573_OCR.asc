Theologyand business combined

The Pitt News

Will the day come when our
nation’s churches have a pastor,who
works a full-time secular job during

‘ the week and ministers only on the

weekends? Dr. €.S. Calian, presi-'

dent of the Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary, sees this as a future possi-
bility. « '

Calian. anticipates that by 1990
there will be a signiﬁcant number of
churches unable to afford the servi-
ces of a'full-time minister. There-
fore,. he said,'today’s ministerial stu-
dents may need to receive more than

pastoral skills. . »

To- address this modern-day‘ reli-
gious issue, Calian and Dr. H.J.
Zoffer, dean of the University of

_‘Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of ‘

Business, have designed a four-year
program leading to a joint Master of
Divinity and’ Master of "Business
Administration degree. This unique
program is the second of its kind in
the nation.

Emory University’~s Graduate
School of ‘Business and Candler
School of Theology in Atlanta
began the model program in 1983 at
the urgingof a student who wanted
to acquire both business and theo-
logical knowledge. Dr. George M_
Parks, dean of Emory'Univers1ty’s
Graduate School of Business, said,
‘‘It was seen as very pragmatic to

integrate the‘ two disciplines, there
being advantages for both schools.”

The business] religious. program

-ideahad been discussed in local’ aca-

demic _ci,rcles but was brought to
fruition when Edward V. Clarke Jr.,
senior executive vice president of the

Westinghouse Electric Corporation,

introduced Calian and Zoffer. They
pursued the program’s acceptance
and designed a course outline which
was approved by the schools’ facul-
ties. The program implementation is
scheduled for the fall of 1985..

At the last meeting of the Student
Government Board for the semester,
the board members gave their ﬁnal
reports and included their thanks to
each other. A majority of the newly-
elected board members were pres-

Karen Frost.

Pamela Hart mentioned in her
report that she attended the Provost
Planning Committee meeting. Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin is planning an
open student forum to discuss the
university’s plans, to be held on Jan.
8 at 4 p.m. in Dining Room B of the
William Pitt Union. The forum is
open to the members of the High
Nine and any interested students.

Hart also mentioned that Provost

SGB appoints     
8 for allocations

By Louise Marshall
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
has appointed eight new members to
the Allocations Committee. The
1985 committee includes: freshmen
Fiora Bohem, Phyllis,Rotman, Kyle
Sugarman; sophomores Bryan
Kaplan and Tim Oskin; juniors Pete
Ficarri Ill, Pam Underwood, Victor
Wilboro Ill and alternate Dave
Benado, a senior graduating in 1986.

Newly-elected President Luke
Kluchko, Allocations Chairman
John Benchoff, board member
Avery Abrams and Wendy Pekich
and Allocations Committee member
"Keith Christian interviewed the 49
Pitt students who applied.

The applicants were judged on six
important factors: time (the average
allocations member must work 18
hours a week), objectivity, interpre-
tation of policies, self-evaluation,
conditions of policies and interper-
sonal skills. The role of the alloca-
tions member is to keep in touch _
with student organizations. Alloca-- '
tions provides student organizations
with a -link to the Student Govern-
ment Board. .

According to Allocations Chair-
man Benchoff, the committee
members deal with a diversity of ~
people and problems». “Each organi-
zation is unique however small it is; _

it is important to the people involved I - ‘

with it,” said Benchoff.

“I've learned to respect people's
opinions and their diversities,” said ‘

Final advice for freshmen

By Greg Evanlna
The Pitt News

Well, it’s that time of the year
again. The semester is winding
down. But by no means is it over
until we lay down our pencils after
that last final. Most college students
will agree that the final exam period
is one of the most frustrating and
pressured times of the school year.

Every" upperclassman has expe-
rienced a college final exam. But
freshmen, who are just out of high
school, really do not have an idea of
what is in store for them in the up-
coming few weeks. One thing every-,
one will have to put up with is long
hours of hard work. But unless stu-
dents make the most of their study
time, they probably will not fare
very well on these important tests.

So that a little insight might be
gained on the subject of preparing
for finals, The Pitt News asked some
upperclassmen to break down and
give the freshmen some of their
hard-earned knowledge about
studying for finals.

Since time is so important to stu-
dents, they obviously cannot afford
to waste it. Toni, a senior anthropol-
ogy student, advised, “One of the

I most important things is to learn to

organize your time efficiently. Just
get a calendar, write down what you
have to do each day and follow that
schedule. If you’ve set enough time

aside, you really shouldn‘t have too A

many problems with finals.”

Janet, a fourth-year occupational
therapy student, concurred with
Toni’s idea of good organization,
but had this to add: “Start studying
early. A lot of people cram, but I
can’t do that. I have to study a little
bit each night.”

Now, freshmen, once you’ve de-
cided what you’re going to study and
when you’re going to study it, you
must choose where you kwill study.

warned: Studying at

Jan, a senior majoring in communi-
cations, had advice for freshmen liv-
ing in the dorms. She said, “If you
live in a dorm, you have to get away
from there if you’re going to study.
There are just too many temptations
in the dorms.”

If you’re a freshman, you might
ask, “Where should I study?" Since
this is probably your first semester,
you might not be very well ac-
quainted with all the nooks and
crannies of Pitt. However, seniors,
simply because they’ve been here for
four years, have located some excel-
lent spots for studying. Out of the 50
polled, here are some of their favor-
ite study places: Benedum Hall
classrooms, anywhere in Forbes
Quadrangle, the Law Library,
Scaife Library and WPIC Library.

To be sure, libraries aregood pla-
ces to study. However, freshmen, be

Library is almost always detrimental
to your grades. All of the seniors
who were polled agree that, because
of the large number of people who
study at Hillman, the odds are that
you will see at least two people you

know. The odds are even greater

that you will strike up a conversa-
tion with these people and take away
precious time/from your studying.

Now, once you’re all prepared to
hit the books, you have to decide on
the right parts of the material to hit.
Greg, a senior economics major, ad-
vised, “It all depends on whether the
material is cumulative. If it’s cumu-
lative, you concentrate on the main
points of the material throughout
the term. The only thing to look at in
great detail is the most recently-
covered material.” ‘

Another senior, Jim, who majors
in electrical engineering, said, “I
don’t reread my books. Mainly, I
just study my notes because they
give me a good idea about what I've
learned all semester.”

Now that you’ve picked out all the
right information to study, you’re
well on your way. But studying does
take a lot out of you. John, ajunior
in engineering, said, “IfI'm studying

for anything, I have to take a break 3

for about 10 minutes every hour. It
helps clear out my brain and lets me
relax for a little bit."

Louise, a senior in political
science, said that she tires easily dur-
ing studying. In order to cope with
fatigue, she said, “Some of the best
advice I could give to freshmen is to
run down to the store and get some
caffeine — any type will do. Coffee
and No-Doz are my two favorites.
And if you smoke, make sure you’ve
got enough cigarettes to last you.
Food is another thing I make sure I
have before I leave to go study. Now,
these things don’t make you any
more intelligent, but at least you
won’t fall asleep on your books with
exhaustion or starvation.”

Now that all the preparation and
studying are past, the day of your
final "exam rolls around. You’re
really anxious because you don’t
know what to expect. After all, this
test might make the difference
between your getting a new car or a
lump of coal for Christmas.

Like most of us, Troy, another
veteran student, has been in the
same situation. He said, “Before one
final, I got so nervous that my mind
went blank. I couldn’t think right,
and I didbad on the final. My advice
to freshmen is not to get nervous. Do
something to release your energy —
jump.up and down if you have to.
But try not to be nervous —- it really
can hurt you.” »

Well, freshmen, here you have it
~— the knowledge learned from years
of going through finals. If you fol-
low what is contained in this article,
then you shouldn't have too many
problems. But just one more thing:
Don’t do like this reporter did before
one final and forget to set your
alarm clock before you go to bed!

  
     

     

 
    
    
  
  
   
 
   

Pitt educates tea

ty‘s elementary and secondary
school educators are prepared to

and research program relating to the
use of computers in the schools."
The courses will focus on microcom-

puter training, instruction, curricu-

lum development and computer
software evaluation. Courses are
available at all grade levels, kinder-
garten through 12th grade, in all

teach in a technology-geared society'*‘”'subject areas this winter term, Nous‘

- is the aim of the School of Educa-

tion’s new Regional Computer
Resource Center (RCRC).

To achieve this goal, the center
hopes to increase teacher knowledge
in computer-information technol-
ogy as well as assist local school dis-
tricts in acquiring, utilizing and
upgrading computer hardware and
software. _

The Pitt RCRC officially opens
Jan. I_, 1985, and will be located on

the first ﬂoor of Forbes Quadrangle. '

Dr. Albert Nous, director of the
center, said, “The Pitt RCRC pro-
vides a complete educational service

said.

Pitt’s Computer Resource Center,
along with 12 other resource centers
across the commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, became possible on July 9,
1984, when Governor Thornburgh
signed into law the Information and
Technology Act. The act also pro-

P vides for the allocation of $28 mil-

lion over four years to support the 13
RCRC’s throughout the common-
wealth.

In additon to the teachers and
administrators of Allegheny Coun-
ty’s 43 school districts, graduate stu-
dents at Pitt are also eligible to take

the basic and specialized courses.
Four courses will be offered at the
center. Tuition will be paid by the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA).
Classes will be taught by Pitt’s own
grad school professors, and students
who complete the course will earn
three graduate credits.

When asked how Pitt acquired the
center over Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity, a collegiate leader in compu-
ter science research, instruction and
technology, Dr. Nous said, “It was
our [Pitt’s] earlier success with the
Science Teacher Education Pro-
gram.‘f STEP was also a PHEAA-
funded program that helped
secondary teachers improve their
science and math teaching through

the use of microcomputers. PHEAA

.Executive Director Kenneth R.

Reecher, legislators, elementary and
secondary school teachers lauded
the STEP program,” said Nous.

chers in the use of computers   

“Our strong belief in researchand ’ ..
development is stressed with the ce_n-' " w

Another major reason why Pitt
acquired the center, he said, was a
clause in the lnforrnation and Tech-
nology Act which requires the coor-
dination of the new RCRC activities
with the existing Science Teacher
Education Program.

Dean James Kelly Jr. said that the "1 '

establishment of the.RCRC is con-
sistent with the School of Educa-
tion’s mission to provide assistance
to local school districts in areas such
as computer-based instruction.

Other objectives of the RCRC
include teacher training in computer
education helping to design
computer-oriented curricula and
assisting with software evaluation so
that schools may purchase software
wisely. These objectives will be met
through the use of multiple resour-
ces which will be developed to meet
the needs of students and educators,
said Nous.

Additional resources will be imple-

duration of the center. Some future
resources include school district
linkages with the center and a video]
disk/ tape library of technology.

“Our philosophy is that in order . H

to serve _iustly the legislative intent

and promote educational equity, we  —

center can be obtained by calling Dr.

If you would like to get a sense
of what is __a,vant-garde at Pitt,
you’ll want to check out “Project
X” on Sunday (Dec. 9) at 8 p.m.
in the assembly room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. “Project X”

promises to be a concert of multi-
media compositions by working
artists. These artists, Tom Beik-
man, Tom Papandakous, David
Lezek, Rex Nordheimer and Jim
Lovendusky‘, have put together a

work that combines the forces of

video, film, sound, noise, art per- -

formance and theater.

“It's different from what usu-
ally goes on on campus,” said
Papandakous about “Project

X." “It's not a movie, not a reci-
tal, not a hand; it's not standard
entertainment." The different
fare has a lot to do with these
artists‘ interests. Claiming to be
influenced by such artists as

Laurie Anderson, David Bowie,
Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno, Stock-
hausen, Dahli, Cage, Pollack
and Picasso, these artists are'try-
ing to interrelate many arts.

Common Ground

This is not an editorial on the commercialization of Christ-
mas. Contrary to popular opinion, the writers whose creations
fill these pages are not insensitive, nor do they deem themselves
unworthy of criticism. None of us would be living at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh if we held the solutions to life’s problems.
We are here, hopefully learning, because we want to better our
understanding of ourselves, of others and of the inﬁnite myster-

,ies of our existence. We care. This is our common "ground.

Striving to meet organizational requirements, working to
earn and sustain a modest standard of living and various forms

' of competition often pit us against one another in a battle over

material possessions, superﬁcial, and hence, temporary
rewards. Rather than become enlightened dynamic beings, we
sometimes become victimized by the very sources that should
be resources under our control. As a consequence, we not only
miss the underlying meaning of the things we do and the
reasons behind our doing them, but also lose touch with what
we are. We lose sight of our common ground.

Obvious problems arise from this loss. Individuals drasti-
cally misunderstand the intentions and motivations of others.
Groups of individuals ﬁnd themselves unable to deal with
conﬂicting perceptions of interests and nations fight wars they
never really seem to win. Little is gained, at least in the long run,
by such activity. If so little is to be gained in the long run, who is
to say we’ve grown?

If we recognize the real value ofeducation, then growth is, or.
should be, our ultimate goal. Growth is not measured by the
amount of data we’re able to regurgitate, nor by the number of
“points" we acquire on some scale of success. The value of a
human being should not be evaluated quantitatively at all, but
rather, by the quality of one‘s experience. Such quality is

achieved through the empathic understanding of other human

beings and the situations in which they find themselves.
The main problem threatening our civilization today is the

' _ huge discrepancy between the rate of our technological growth

and that of personal or spiritual growth. Many of us are like
children playing with adult toys. We’ve been taught to divide
ourselves up into teams, large and small, according to a variety
of criteria, to compete for “prizes" we know not what to do with
once we’ve “won" them. We use each other, and ourselves, as

- instruments to attain objects we label desirable and necessary.

The amount of value we give to these objects rarely matches
that of the time, effort and care —— the human elements —— that
made those ends attainable.

The holiday season is, to us, time given apart from our
periodic activities to pursue, or at least think about, the quality
of our lives. In this holiday season, we sanctify the value o_f

.—family, friends, health, joy, sorrow, and through these things,

ourselves. It is real Thanksgiving, one which people of every
nation observe in one form or another. But the Christmas
holiday is not just time given or spent; it is a true spirit, an
attitude or state of mind. It is realizing that which all humans
share — the gift of a giving spirit, the gift of love. Nothing can

‘ be of more value. Nothing exceeds its quality.

Letters to the Editor

Mercy I
of

Sandinistas

The Dec. 5 issue of The Pitt News,
carried Mike Nicol’s report on the
talk which Bob Norman and I gave
to the Pitt Arms Race Study Group
relating our recent experiences trav-
eling in Nicaragua. Nicol’s piece is,
for the most part, more or less close
to what I actually said, and the dif-
ferences are not worth quibbling
about except for the last sentence.
Nicol quotes me as saying that the
Nicaraguan revolution is “not com-
plete till the regime [Somoza] is
totally suppressed." This is a drastic
misstatement of what I said and
seriously misrepresents my expe-
-rience of Nicaragua.

The statement I made about revo-
lutions against brutal regimes came
in the context of‘ responding to a
question about the repressiveness of
the current Nicaraguan government.
I was asked what evidence of repres-
sion I saw while I was there. I an-
swered that Nicaragua was the only
Central American country in which
one can travel by bus without being
subjected to frequent ID checks and
pat-down searches. In Honduras, El
Salvador, and Guatemala, each of
which is an American “ally,” these
searches are common. Among these
four Central American countries
where I traveled, it is only Nicaragua
in which internal security is not a
concern. The people travel any-
where in the country without being
molested by the police or army. In
fact, in Nicaragua, unlike any of the
other countries, the militia and army
ride the buses, armed and in uni-
form, shoulder-to- shoulder with the
people. In Nicaragua, the army and
popular militia are defending the
country.against foreign aggression.
In Honduras, El Salvador, and Gua-
temala, the army and police serve to.
secure internal order and protect the
government in power from the peo-
ple it governs. The difference strikes
me as rather telling on the question
of repression, and yet among these
governments it is only Nicaragua

. which our president chooses to

accuse of totalitarianism. .

I went on to explain that in Mana-
gua I talked with Mary Hartman, an
American nun (from Altoona, Pa.),
who is director of Nicaragua's Com-
mission to Protect and Promote
Human Rights. From, her I learned
that 4,000 ex-Somoza, National
Guardsmen were imprisoned during
the year after the revolution. None
of those imprisoned, were killed
(since in Nicaragua, unlike the other

' , " Central Americ'an‘c_ountries, there is,
‘ 

 
  

  

‘Sin this,r¢.po‘r_t

  

  

last four years, 2,000 of these ex-
Guardsmen have been released
under legislation known as the Laws
of Grace (Leyes de Gracias), which
instituted a body of lawyers to
review all the cases of those impri-
soned. The rationale of the law is
that during the first months after the
revolution, feelings ‘against those
who cooperated with Somoza ran
inordinately high. Mary told me that
700 more were scheduled for release
after the elections in November. A
few of those released go north across
the border to Honduras and join
with the contras. The government
knows that thi s happens and yet
acceptsvit as a necessary price of
commitment to its principles.

It was in this context that I com-
mented about the Nicaraguan revo-
lution and was misquoted. I said
that the Sandinista leaders were
smart people with an awareness of
history. It. is part of the program of
their revolution to understand that a
.revolution against brutal repression
is not successful unless brutality
ends ' when power is gained. The
revolution is not complete until
government is just and humane and

maintains power without coercion.‘

Carlos Fonseca, founder of the
FSLN and its acknowledged
spiritual-philosophical leader even
now (he fell in combat in 1974), for-
mulated this principle in a slogan:

“implacable in combat, generous in» ‘
- victory.” In my statement, I meant

to call attention to this quality of
mercy, which is formally a part of
the Sandinista program for Nicara-
gua. In perhaps any other violent

revolution in history, Isuggested, ,

the ex-Somoza guardsmen would no
longer be alive, there would be no
question of whether they have been
granted due process. The issue of
repression in.Nicaragu‘a should be
considered in this context.

At no time did I say the Nicara-
guan revolution is “not complete till
the regime is totally suppressed.”

police thing for once and. for all.
First, the Pitt police do not run all

-over the city and state “needlessly A

duplicating services," Does an) one
in their right mind actually think this
is what is happening? What the
-officer, who has been badly mis-'
quoted, saidwas that if a crime is
committed on campus, they can
arrest the criminal anywhere ‘in
Pennsylvania, not that they patrol”
the streets of Pittsburgh and Penn-
sylvania and run all around Pennsyl-
vania making arrests. You have to
be a fool to think that the University
of Pittsburgh is ‘going to pay for a_
police force to patrol the City of
Pittsburgh and the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.

Also, Alva Myrdal’s Dec. 5 letter
falsely stated ‘that Duquesne and

- CMU do not have detective squads.

First, Pitt has only three detectives. I
called CMU and Duquesne police;
CMU has an investigator and

‘ Duquesne has a crime unit. I know-

several other colleges and universi-
ties that also do. In fact, the Pitts-
burgh public schools have a security
force with policing powers.

Finally, I don't think the Nov. 2
Pitt News article was “very reveal-

ing” as Dorricn Tuchmann-said. I ’

think it was irresponsible_ and
stupid. It showed that the writers

write before they check the facts. It is '
quite obvious that all the people who - ’

On the Light Side /Kate Piatek
The Spirit of Christmas  

Christmas. Silence in the bios-
phere under three inches of new
snow. Little kids making a snowman
out in the backyard. They have red
cheeks and red noses; they laugh and
chose a longer carrot to stick it
where the snowman's nose should
be. An old daddy's hat goes on the
head and a red scarf around the neck
— but drug stores are closed Christ-
mas day, so where will they buy
Dristan to relieve snowman's l2 cold
symptoms? ‘ -

Inside the house Mom checks th
Christmas turkey in the oven. She is
in a hurry; she still has to wash the
kitchen windows, dust the furniture
in the living room, clean the carpet
in the bedroom and bake three pies.
Oh, yes! She has to go to the store to
get a new bag of pretzels for her
children.

A tasty fragrance from the oven
fills the kitchen. It stimulates scent
receptors in the noses of two college
kids sitting in the living room watch-
ing TV. “Mom,. could you pass
potato chips?”

The colorful lights on the Christ-
mas tree set warm highlights around
the darkened room. One might think
that it is Christmas time. From the
discription, yes, it should be. But the
inhabitants of this-house don’t know
what Christmas is all about. It's
about Christmas spirit.

I know a different kind of Christ-

is
E
O
‘N

mas that occurs in a faraway land.
No, not at the North Pole. The rea-
son for this might be that Saint
Nicholas, as he is called here, doesn’t
come during Christmas; he comes
on the night of Dec.6 and really, I
don’t know where he lives, but it's
not at the North Pole for sure. So,
OK, they don't get presents under
the tree. But they have something
special — I would say even more
special than presents — they have
the Christmas spirit.

Preparations for Christmas start
late, but that depends how many
days off mothers and children get
from work and schools. Yes, women
work there, just as men do, full-time.
Once cleaning starts, everybody
helps. Kids dust the furniture, clean
the carpets and arrange back their
bedrooms. Moms might do the
heavier work, but that also depends
on the age of the children. If they are
college age, they usually chose the
heavy work. You know, the kind

‘ where the macho image gets to be

shown off. I don’t know about men;
I think it is an individualdecision if
they help or not. But from what I
know about the customs in general, I
believe they help outjust as much as
they can.

The day before Christmas, Moms
cook the “supper of the year,” I

’ would call it, because so much prep-

aration goes into it and so many spe-

cial, traditional dishes are made. A
fried carp is a must. Traditional
Christmas Eve dinner should consist
of I2 dishes; however, only the old
people might (only might)
remember what goes into such a
dinner. Anyway, it's a great feast.

The day before Christmas is espe-
cially reserved for Christmas tree
decorating. Usually, the children do
that. When everything is ready
(Christmas tree and the dinner)
someone watches for the first star to
brighten up the sky. That‘s the signal
for the dinner to begin. Everyone
comes to the table and they start
with breaking of the Eucharist
bread. Everyone is with everyone
else, and while doing it, they wish
each other happiness. Then they sit
down and eat. By then one feels that
special Christmas feeling. It is as if
all the worries, troubles and angers
went away and only only love
remained behind.

One wants to be extra nice to eve-
ryone else; ,one wants to give and
share; one wants to show one cares. I
believe that stems from working
together for_ that special day; and
notice, it's not even Christmas yet.

On Christmas day everyone sits
around watching TV and eating
cheese cakes, poppy seed cakes and
other goodies. The pleasure is dou-
ble — you work hard together and
relax together.

About Town /  Lewis

Death at an Early Age

We are all minorities. We are
black, white, cream, tan, gold, yel-
low, brown and peach. Some of us
are Catholics or Buddhists or some-
thing else. But we're all different, so
we're all minorities.

Look into a crowd of 100,000
British miners and see one crowd.
Look deeper into the one crowd and
see 100,000 British miners who have
individually decided to go on strike,
who have made a choice based on
the sum total of the facets of their
individual lives today. Don't think
that the police who are ordered to
fire jets of water at them are any
different. They are singular individ-
uals to a man, each with a separate
past and a separate present,
gathered on the scene for their own
personal reasons.

Think about your earliest
memory. Yourﬁrst date. Your first
real kiss. Your first fight. Your first
hangover next to Mum in church on
Sunday morning. You probably
have more memories than there are
actors to act them -out or meters of

_film to film them on, and the only

one who can really know them is
you. ‘

I recently heard a woman say that
the whole of a black person's exist-
ence is politics: how to get by, passed
over, helped out or moved on by the
white man. What an easy and

squeaky clean world we would live
in if this were true! The white man is
this way here, and the black man is
over here reacting. There. Simple.
All we have to do now is dash about
shouting racially patriotic gibberish.
Adolf Hitler said that Jews and
blacks were not human beings
because they had no homeland,

ruddiness or other European back--

ground characteristics. That man's
definition must, empirically, be
ﬂawed; a human being is a mind —
not more, not less.

Every black man and woman has
memories — some good, some bad
—- just, like every white man and

- every engineering student, Russian
man or bald man. Maybe there is a.

tragic amount of black men and
women whohave more bad memo-
ries than good because of the lives
they've led, but that fact does not
have to be a fact forever because
we're all human beings with
thoughts, feelings and minds! If all
of us individuals decide individually,
though, that the brown‘, cream or
yellow fellow across the room is way
“X" and there's nothing I, he or the
.gods can do about it, and so I might
as well be suspicious of him before
we even meet. That's the tragedy,
because it's a lie. If we lie to our
children, the lie might live forever.

The Pitt News

'“Merton:

“Writing is 95 percent tenacity
and 5 percent talent,” stated author
Paul Wilkes, who is a visiting writer
and guest lecturer at the University
of Pittsburgh. In a recent interview,
Wilkes gave some advice to those
interested in becoming writers.

“Tcc many’ students are con-
cerned with job security," began
Wilkes. “Too many of them end up
in p.r. [public relations] jobs instead
of going for news or magazine. They
have low opinions of themselves -4
too many sell themselves too short.”

His advice: “Don’t sell out too
early. There are jobs for those who
try — if you want to do it. Don't take
jobs if you're not inspired by them.
Remember, writing can be done part
time. You know, there are millions
of newspapers and magazines just
dying for the stuff."

Paul Wilkes should know. He is a
producer, director, author of six
books and a “jack of all trades”
newsmarf The list goes on —— he was
the host‘, associate producer and

director_of the acclaimed PBS televi- ‘

sion series, “Six American Fami-
lies," which won the DuPont-Co-

lumbia award for documentary

excellence. His film credits include

the recently released documentary
A Film Biography of
Thomas Merton.” Additionally,
Wilkes‘ has written for numerous

national magazines and is a former_

reporter for the Baltimore Sun and
the Boulder Daily Camera and he
was the editor for Harper and Row
and Harper’s Magazine Press.
Perhaps the most obvious ques-
tion to ask now would be, “How did
all this begin?” Wilkes seems to sense
the question and immediately begins
to rattle off his history as 2. writer.

“My ﬁrs’. writing was done for the-

high school newspaper in Cleveland,
Ohio," he stated, matter-of-factly.
“From there I went to Marquette
University forjournalism. But it [his
real desire to write] didn’t quite
click, though.”

Wilkes received his B.A. in jour-
nalism from Marquette and was
drafted as an officer in the Navy in

' 1960. It was there, while stationed in
.Pakistan, that Wilkes knew he was

meant to write.

“I read their newspapers, and I
knew it was a complete lie,” Wilkes
stated frankly. “I wanted. to tell the
truth. That set me on my way.”

After Wilkes returned to the Unit-
ed States, he went to graduate
school at Columbia University in
New York, and received his Masters

— in journalismfln both graduate

school and college, he was a medio-
cre student, averaging around a 2.34
and spending long hours at work in a
factory. His attitude remained one

ner gives advice t

of “just stick with it and go after it."

“I always wrote feature -— I didn’t
like news stories,” Wilkes said in ref-
erence to his newspaper assign-
ments. “Then I launched my
freelance career.” The tale behind
how his freelance career began is
interesting and it is clear that he is
proud to tell it.

“Dustin Hoffman had to come to
town [Baltimore] for a show. The
whole time he was on stage, I noticed
that he kept his hand in his pocket —
the reason was that he had cut it.”

Apparently, from Wilkes’descrip-
tion, there was some confusion when
those with Hoffman realized the
situation. Wilkes, thinking quickly,
mentioned tlxat Johns Hopkins Hos-
pital was nearby, and that he would
take them to it. He was able to ride
with Hoffman in his car, and get a
good interview in the process. The
story appeared later in “New York
Magazine.”

From then on, he worked as a
freelance writer. At first, the going
was slow, so he took afull-time pub-
lic relations job in New York. As the
freelancing increased, he cut his job
to part time, in order to do the work
he enjoyed. “I feel lucky over the
years to be able to write about the
things I want to,” Wilkes reflected.

Wilkes has since then written six
books. For one book, “Try Out the
Dream," he lived with an American
family for one year.

“It is essential for an in-depth
story to live among those you are

explains his reason for this series.

“My idea in 1972 was that some-
thing had happened to the tradi-
tional American family. I wanted to
capture what’s happening, so it was
like a history documentary.”

Perhaps his most interesting expe-
rience was living near a group of
Trappist monks for one year. Wilkes
confides that he had once considered
that way of life, while following
rather closely the life and career of

Persian

Gulf war
to be won   .

By Joel A; Bloom
The Pitt News

“The United States leans more
towards supporting Iraq than Iran
in the Persian Gulf War,” com-
mented David McGiffert, former
assistant secretary of defense on
international security affairs.

McGiffert’s comments came in an
interview following his speech Tues-
day which he insisted be off the
record. His sneechiwas the latest in a
series of talks on “Security in" an
Independent World." His topic was .-
the United States’ security interests
in the Persian Gulf and the Middle
East. ‘ ' A . A

“It isn’t so much that vjve[thefU.S.]lj
love Iraq, or hate Iran that much.
But it would be moredesirable for

' the United States to strive towards

preventing a total Iranian victory. It
wouldn't be good for either country
to dominate the other." i S -

As for. the possibility of Soviet

intervention in the area, McGiffert "
~ said, “I don't think that there is any
. real threat of intervention and/ or

domination of -either country. We

, don’t have a whole lotto fear from

them in this respect."

What about Lebanon? McGiffert .

Calian also noted that pastors
should know how to market the
churches’ services, deal with a
budget and raise money for church
support in order to keep the church
in step with the increasingly com-
plex world of tomorrow. “There are
basic marketing principles," said
Calian, “known to thebusiness com-
munity which might be suggestive to
church leadership." '

“As a v pastor," said the Rev.
Cameron Malcolm‘of the Bentley-

ville United Presbyterian Church, “I .

amobligated to ensure that there is
adequate funding for our youth pro-
grams, the purchase of a van for our
elderly and wisely planning our
budget resource utilization.” Mal-
colm, however, "sees personal evan-
gelism as the best way tomarket a
church’s services," not the use of busi-
ness techniques. _

The idea ofa pastor engaging in a
vocation outside the ministry during
the week is bound to stir controver-
sy. Malcolm-said that a part-time
minister would be unable to dojus-
tice to the needs of a congregation.
Calian, however, believes that it is a
practical solution to a co ntem_porary
dilemma. ‘ ‘

Calian said that he found a bibli— ’

cal basis for his stand on receivng
skills from both the secular and
"sacred worlds in the New Testament.
The Apostle Paul was a tent maker
so that hercould sustain himself to
preach the gospel. Calian .sees the
Master ‘of Divinity/M.B.A. joint
program as a modern “Tent Making
Ministry.”

Parks of the .Emory School of W

Business said that the joint program
offers benefits to the business stu-
dents as well as the seminary stu-

dents. The classroom discussions f or‘_

ty/ M.B.A. joint program, business
students would be encouraged to
think as broadly as possible, not just
in terms of maximizing profits. In
addition, Zoffer said that teaching
management of people, resources,
information and strategic planning
can be the business world’s contribu-
tion to society. ' , —

Zoffer said, “Those of us in rriajor
business schools have a certain mis-
sionary zeal in having applications
of business principles taught to var-
ious sectors of society. The various
social institutions require the same
kind of managerial competence that
businesses do."

The joint program also provides
the opportunity to combine the busi-
ness faculty and the seminary

faculty. “A behavioral thrust is used ‘

in both curricula and it is fundamen-
tal that students in both areas learn
to respond to people and reduce
conflict. Through this program
many insights can be shared,” said
Zoffer. -

program is not a’ watered—down ver-
sion of the standard requirements of
either school, according to Calian. A
joint-program student would be tak-
ing computer, accounting and eco-
nomics courses along with the
traditional theology subjects. A first

term student would take, among ’

other classes, such courses as “Inter-
preting the Bible” and “Computer-

second year student would be com-
bining such classes as “Christology’
and “Managerial Accounting.”

Although applications have not
yet been made for the Master of Div-
inity/ M.B.A. program, Zoffer fore-
sees that there will be between five
and 10 students entering it next fall.

Forty percent of the students at
the seminary are attempting to
establish a second career by attend-
ing the seminary. Calian said that
they probably would not be inter-
ested in the joint degree program
because many of them already have
business experience. The remaining
60 percent of the student population
are recent college graduates to
whom this religious/business plan
should appeal. Calian" feels the

cially attractive to . women and

exercise
can be

safe say
doctors

By Steven H. Shussett
The Pitt News

With appropriate clothing and
health precautions, university health
experts say exercise and physical ﬁt-
ness activities can be continued
safely throughout the colder
months. Among the factors empha-
sized are environmental conditions,
clothing and pre- and post-exercise

preparationas well as the actual ‘

exercise.

According to Philip Kanfush,
former athletic trainer for the foot-
ball and men's and women’s track
teams, winter exercise is, in a sense, a
matter of the environment.

“Humidity predisposes one to
physiological stress, with heat. ,With
winter, it’s stress of a different sort
— cold and its effects.”

That sentiment is shared by Dr.
Kenneth F. Metz and Irene Dunny.

Metz, chairman of _the Health,
Physical and Recreation Depart-
ment, emphasized the chilling that
can lead to a low resistance to illness.
This would make the body more sus-
ceptible to respiratory problems.

There are also the added problems
of falling or slipping on ice and early

nightfall, both of which are good »

reasons to take extra care, said Ms.
Dunny, a registered nurse of staff
with the Student Health Center.

There is not a lot of evidence
about the effects of temperature
when exercising; common sense is
the advice Metz gives.

“Pittsburgh area temperatures are"

never really too cold,” he said,

“although once -it's sub-zero, it _

might be best to exercise inside. If

one -has a good fitness level, one can ‘

be comfortable outside. To start
training when in an unfit condition
isn’t recommended. You would be
better off in the field house."

All three noted the effects of frigid
air on breathing, but emphasized
that it is mainly a personal matter
based on comfort. .If breathing
becomes uncomfortable because of
the cold, they advise-covering the
mouth and nose with anything from
a scarf to~a 3M respiratory mask.

Clothing precautions involve
keeping the body warm but prevent-
ing overheating. This can be
achieved by wearing clothing that is
not too tight around the neck or
wrists, because that will trap heat
and perspiration, said Metz. This
trapping causes chilling when the
exercise ends. , \

Dr. Bob Robertson, director of
the Human Energy Lab at Pitt, sug-
gests layering garments “to provide
an insulative barrier, ’ or micro-
climate, which can also be removed
if overheating." _ .

Ms. Dunny also recommends
gloves, warm socks and a hat. Along
with risks of frostbite, she said that
upwards of 60 percent of the body's
heat is lost through the head.

Warming up and cooling down
periods are vital for physical well-
being during winter exercise. With-
out these, soft tissue damage such as
muscle pulls; strains or soreness are
morelikely. It isgadvised by Metz.
that people warm up inside before
immediately beginning a stimulating
activity such as running or skiing. If
warming up outside, however, be
sure to wear heavier clothing than
the clothes that will be worn during
the activity.

' The cool down‘ is necessary to
bring the body back to a resting con-
dition and to offset metabolic by-

products, such as lactic acid, which

causes muscle soreness,

Exercises that were suggested
_include running, cross country ski-
ing, walking and continuous _ice

V skating. These develop the aerobic.
and ca dtovascular systems, which

Hollywood Christmas:

Dudley Moore and Amy Irving in Micki and Maude.

Dudley's double dilemma j 

by Jeffrey Sewald V

"For a long time we looked for some-
thing to put Blake and Dudley back
together," explained producer Tony
Adams of Micki 6: Maude, the first pairing
of director Blake Edwards and Dudley
Moore since the enormously successful
10. Opening in time for the holidays, the
film is much as one might expect being a
vehicle developed specifically to showcase
Moore's comic abilities and warm screen

presence.

"This was one of the reasons that Blake
accepted this script he hadn't written. I
think he went into it with a lot of confi-
dence, and as the casting kept progress-
ing, he got more and more excited about it
and its possibilities."

Once again ‘we see lovable Dudley
Moore wreak havoc with the order of
things, getting himself into an incredible
predicament. A television reporter of
some modest stature, Moore's Rob Salin-

ger is happily married to wife Micki, a
lawyer and devout career woman (played
convincingly by Ann Reinking). But Rob
is a sensitive chap. He wants a family, a
little baby to smother with love. Micki
wants to be a judge.

Enter Amy Irving as Maude, a beautiful
cellist, at Rob's most vulnerable moment.
An affair. Oops! Guess who gets preg-
nant? But Rob is happy. He'll finally get to
be the father he's always longed to be.
Things are looking up. Alas, the prover-
bial monkey wrench. Just when he thinks
he has his wife pegged'as an incurable
career chaser, Micki decides to put every-
thing on hold. She loves Rob. And she's
pregnant. ‘

This wonderfully intricate plot is

woven together tightly by screenwriter .
- Jonathan Reynolds. But regardless of the

quality of the script, it is sincerely doubt-'
ful that the film would have ever made it
into production without Dudley Moore.

"I can't think of another actor who
could have pulled it off," stated co-star
Amy Irving at a recent press conference
in New York. "None have that kind of
comic talent, kind of lovable and under-
standing, to get away with that. There
just aren't many that good.”

There is little doubt that the success or
failure of Micki ér Maude rests solely. upon
the public's like or dislike of Rob Salinger.
Take a close look at the social issues that
are raised in this film. Infidelity, worse
yet bigamy, career vs. parenthood,
sexism.

"I think the movie does make a social
comment in terms of whefe society is
going. Dealing with two working persons
in the home, relationships. I think there
will probably be some controversy raised

. by the Moral Majority," predicted Adams.

Such a reaction would truly be a shame,
since the film isn't actually about adultery
or mistrust. It is about love and responsi-
bility. Part of the complexity of Moore's
challenge is that he must get the audience
to break firmly ingrained thinking habits.
He must succeed in making us believe
that he does indeed love both women-and
that nothing sordid is going on. That he
does. . / J .

Producer Adams: "The audience is just
as divided as the Dudley Moore character.
Basically, it becomes the audience's
dilemma as well.”

What is he to do? He can't tell his wife
of his situation with -Maude. She's already

‘ had _one miscarriage and he's been told

that such a shock may adversely affect
her pregnancy. Rob paces, brow fur-
rowed. He's perplexed. As he explains his
problem to friend Leo Brody, "we're all

a gem and a lump of coal

getting what we want! It'll all work out! I
love them! Don't you get it?"

Supporting Dudley Moore in the film
as Leo Brody is Richard Mulligan, of
"Soap" fame, who tries to be the voice of
reason, balancing Rob's indiscretions.

"When it comes to value judgments,
Rob is right up there with Custer and
Nixon."

’ "Richard Mulligan was chosen,” offers
Adams, "obviously because he's done a lot
of films with Blake and he's always there
in the front of his mind when he's casting.
But Richard is such a great reactor. His
reactions to what is going on around him
are wonderful."

The ensemble acting in Micki &Maude is
playful, spontaneous and most .of all
warm. Amy Irving explains.

"What Blake does is set up the scene. He
shoots them_all very loosely so you can
get the spontaneity, and just lets» the
camera run. We felt that the actual scenes
were an extension of the good times we
were having.'I think that Blake feels that,
to do comedy, you have to have that tone
on the set. Most of it was fairly scripted
but we really didn't rehearse that much.
The attitude and acting was pretty
unplanned. The words are pretty much
Jonathan Reynolds. When I read the
script, I thought immediately 'I'd like to go
see that movie.’ "

Producer Tony Adams could not reiter-
ate enough how important ‘Blake
Edwards was to the making of the film.
"He brought out those qualities in Dudley
that are so wonderful. I don't think there
is any director today that is as good at that
kind of physical comedy as Blake.

"It's rehearsed improvisation. He'll
improvise and improvise until it comes
down to where it's really no longer
improvisation, but that's where it's
based."

Amy Irving shares theadmiration. "It
was a relief for me that we were lucky
enough to get some things in one shot.
Whatever it was, we wouldn't have to be
funny again or do that again."

Blake Edwards is an extremely compe-
tent director. He knows immediately
what he has captured on film andhe
knows what he wants. He wastes no time.
What he captured at times were some of
the funniest and most touching moments
to come out of Hollywood in recent
memory.,The film itself is an off-beat,
full-forced redefinition of love.

"I happen to think," suggests Tony
Adams with a smile, "it was the perfect
kind of marriage - Dudley and Blake at
that time with that script. It's just one of
those fortunate happenings."

by Jeffrey Sewald

"Orson Welles once said that there are
two kinds of science fiction; one is the
kind of social, political and religious state-
ments; the other is lobster men from
Mars. I like lobster men from Mars."

With such credits behind him as the‘

thrillers Halloween, The Fog and Christine,
director John Carpenter is ready to
release his first love story, Starman.

Casually dressed in a gray sweater,
jeans and tennis shoes, Carpenter
expressed his apprehensions about the
film. "I think the concern is that people
understand what they're coming to see."

There is no mistaking it. This isn't the
run-of-the-mill lobster men from Mars
sci-fi flick. It has its share of serious over-
tones.

Sometime in the recent past, mankind
sent up a sort of space time capsule.
Among its contents was a recording of
greetings in 54 earthly languages as well
as a spoken invitation to all extra-
terrestrials from United Nations’ head
man Kurt Waldheim. Aliens, drop on by.
Well, in drops Jeff Bridges as the visiting
alien who has come to observe life on
Earth and becomes stranded near the
Wisconsin home of widow Jenny Hayden
(Karen Allen). He is to meet his people at
their mother ship in three days at Meteor
Crater, Arizona, more than 2,000 miles
away. =

Cloning himself in the form of Jenny's
‘ecaased husband Scott, the two embark

iross-country journey in an orange
arm’/"./‘lblack 1977 Mustang, first as kid-

—-napper and hostage and then ultimately

Starman

, "It's a good old-fashioned film," said
Carpenter, sipping a glass of water. "I
really thought that this was a good chance
to show a kind of romanticized view of a
trip across America. There hasn't been a
road movie done in a long time. Just two
people on the-road who are goingto some
destination and they have some conflicts
in the beginning and then fall in love."

The opening of Starman is so eerie that it
is bound to grab one's attention, as we
witness the alien's glowing arrival and
subsequent "'symbiotic transformation"
into a handsome clone of Jeff Bridges, the
handywork of special effects king Dick
Smith.

"We cast a 15-year-old boy who looked
a little like Jeff and took a life-size mask of
this kid and a life-size mask of Jeff, and in
between he made 150 separate heads. He
sculpted each one as a stage in between
and then shot it with an animation
camera. It took him 7 months to do it."
Net cost: $60,000.

Other than the costly special effects,
the most admirable aspect of Starman is its
positive sentiment, showing off the
beauty of America and what is inherently
wonderful about the human race.

The alien speaks to Mark Shermin, a
National Security agent (played by Cha-
rles Martin Smith), and offers his apprai-
sal of mankind. "Shall I tell you what I find
most beautiful about you? You are at

. your best when things are worst."

it lacks diversity. He will miss the wide
range of people he has encountered dur-
ing his visit. It is too bad he left before he
recited the Lord's Prayer and sang a few
bars of "God Bless America." What ever
happened to subtlety in popular cinema?

Duringthe opening sequences, we see
the alien becoming more and more
humanized. He learns gestures, how to
eat, how to make love ~— the essentials.
But a problem arises when he begins to

  

4' .’

  
    
  

use the gestures ‘properly, in contexts he
was never taught. But Bridges'character—
ization —— _jerky movements and clipped
speech were convincing enough, and
humorous.

"He did a lot of it himself. He studied
dance and mime right before we started
shooting. I think_a part like this for an
actor could really be disastrous. You can
be boring or you can go overboard and not
be believable." ‘

About three-fourths of Starman is inter-
esting. You begin to anticipate the alien's
little discoveries and learn to appreciate
his insights into human nature. But the
heavy-handed patriotism makes the film
almost laughable at points. Carpenter
doesn't see this as a problem.

"I think there's a romantic move back to
traditional valuesjljthink the country
preceded the filmmak‘ers.’The country
has taken a big swing to the right.
Whether it's true or not, we all want to
believe we're better off and we're all
happy and let's all go jogging and make
lots of money. It's the filmmakers

respondingio what the public's changes _

are. '

Starman is essentially a fairy tale. His
technology is magical and fanciful rather
than scientific.

"Film itself, because of the editing pro-
cess, tends to be like your mind. Very
close to the emotional editorials that you
make with other people and things in
your life, so you tend to identify with
people on the screen. It's an emotional
response _more than anything
intellectual." \

Supergirl

 

Finding a superhero in the

by Richard Sater

The elements within her — intact.
She flies, leaps tall buildings with sin-

gle bounds, has X—ray vision and’

impressive strength. Sounds familiar
— except for gender — but even
that's explainedin three little words

delivered with sincerity and complete _
gravity:

"He's my cousin.” The
speaker: Kara, aka Supergirl -
blonde, wide-eyed, pretty, in space
and on earth a veritable innocent
abroad.

Kara, though, makes a decidedly
bargain-bin superhero; unlike cousin
Superman's, her name implies a cer-

_ the object, which has (in the interim)-

fallen _to earth — specifically into a

bowl of cheese dip at a picnic.

Whoseppicnicz Selena’s. An evil,
ambitious“ lady who says, ”Such’a
pretty world. I can't wait till it's all

mine," and ”I'm considering nothing
less than world domination". An
Omegahedron is exactly the catalyst
she's been seeking. But wait — who's
that in the tights, and what does the
”S" stand for?

Helen Slater offers Ivory Soap
freshness and trusting simplicity as
Kara. To her credit, she seems quite
comfortable on screen — zooming
around on earth or exploring the
cotton—candied fantasy of Argo City.
Peter O'Toole lends his considerable
talent to the proceedings —'a reason-
able enough excuse to hang around
almost until‘ the end of the film. Still
remarkably good looking if alarm-

What's really the matter with the pic-
ture is the near-fatal lack of humor.

bad sells nothing new. The do-and- .

WORD OF MOUTH
The Kinks
Arista

Ray‘ Davies is 40 years old
now; he's been doing rock ’n’ roll
for something like 23 of those
years. Word of Mouth — new
from his band, the Kinks —
alternates rather schizophreni-
cally between the doubt and
confidence of Davies — who
seems to be, on the one hand,
weary of grinding out the prod-
uct yeardafter year, but on the
other, anxious to dispel any
rumors that he can no longer do
it. The probable cause of Davies’
state of confusion is his breakup
with longtime girlfriend Chris-
sie Hynde of the, Pretenders
(who was married recently, but
not to Davies). Word of Mouth
seems to point directly at her,
but to its credit, the album
extends a philosophical and
bewildered ”farewell/best-of-
luck, mate” instead of vicious
name-calling and recrimination.

« Whatever the inspiration,
though, Word of Mouth is good.
Like most of the Kinks’ albums
since the late 1970s, this one has
its share of prime, classic-caliber
compositions. The rest? ”Typi-
cal Kinks" — a euphemism for
the not-bad and well—performed
but hardly inspiring songs that

”Do It Again,” a potential hit
single, kicks off the disc. ”Days
go by/ You wish you were a dif-
ferent guy,” Davies says, fully
aware of the futility involved —
a gritty rocker and a highlight.
In the skating—close-to-
technopop—but-no-harm-done—
department: ”Good Day,” fea-
turing light keyboard passages
and a bluesy harmonica coun-
terpoint -underscoring the lyr-

ics’ desperation; and ”Too Hot,” I

with carnival keyboards and
horns —— a neat dance number.
”Think of all the fun we had in
1984,” Davies comments drily
on England specifically and the
world in general.

”Massive Reductions,” a
decent pounder, deals rather
obviously with the economy
and goes nowhere in particular
lyrically. The hybrid ”Going
Solo” laments, ”_She just decided
to go on and make it alone,” and
then sabotages the mood with
upbeat girl group/1960s hand
claps. Plaintive, gentle ”Missing
Persons” asks, ”Has anybody
seen thatlittle girl of mine?” —
a wistful ballad. Lead guitarist
Dave Davies contributes two:
the better ”Living on a Thin
Line,” self-explanatory, and
”Guilty,” as in ”until you're
proven innocent” — his high,
wailing vocals a distinct con-
trast to his brother's compara-
tively relaxed efforts.

But Ray Davies has the elo-
quence and the last word as
well. He wears his heart on his
sleeve often, but somehow, and
fortunately, he can put across
sentiment that moves without
growing maudlin. ”Summer’s
Gone” reminisces, ”Dad looked.
at 'us/ Then he looked at his

What a difference a year makes

CYNDI LAUPER
Civic Arena
December 4, 1984

by Jeffrey Sewald

"Money changes everything,”
she sings from atop the speaker
cabinets with conviction. So goes
the ascendant career of Cyndi
Lauper, pop-rock's supergirl.

Tuesday evening's performance
at the Civic Arena marked Lauper's
long—awaited return visit to Pitts-
burgh, her first since last December
when she played feverishly to a
small but packed house at The
Decade. The past year has had a
dramatic effect on Cyndi Lauper
the performer.

Last December’s show was raw-
edged, gripping, with a sense of pas-
sion that only inspired talent could
produce. Her return, pleasant as it
was, pandered more to the MTV
crowd, the young teens, sacrificing
much of the gut-level impact of
which she is capable.

After catching Lauper's perform-

_ ance at Cleveland's Blossom Music

Center in September, it was evident
that warning signs were beginning
to surface. Cyndi Lauper is gradu-
ally becoming the caricature that
she's fought so hard all her life to
avoid. A wonderful and warm per-
sonality (enter thewsounds of busi-
nessmen licking their chops) has
become big business.

Opening with a sensuous rendi-
tion of Prince's "When You Were
Mine," the show promised at least a

   

semblance of intimacy. What
occurred was a dilution of Lauper's
naturally warm qualities, due in
part to the size of the hall and in
part to the sterility of the presenta-
tion — a huge, sparsely arranged
stage area, too large for any per-
former to work. The set lacked the
joy and the heartfelt frustration
that were present a year ago when
Lauper-mania was still in its
cocoon. Perhaps the best number of
the evening was the spirited revival
of an old Blue Angel tune, "Maybe
He'll Know," a shaking '50s-style
rocker that appeared to leave most
of the audience unmoved (no video
or airplay to draw upon for refer-
ence, I suppose). '

The set was short, no more than
90 minutes (though the sound was

 

 naanV1 I(INAZ)'

excellently clear), and offered only
one encore, the ebullient ”Girls Just
Want To Have Fun," during which
Cyndi, once again, scaled the
speaker stacks and displayed a sign
procured from the audience that
proclaimed ”Pittsburgh Girls Just
Want To Have Fun.” The sign was
silver glitter on white poster board,
much like the signs you learned to
make in grade school, which isn't

surprising given the large number '

of pre- and early teenagers on hand.
With the house lights fully up,

Cyndi belted out the smash single .

and that was that. Short, sweet and
professional. And disappointing. It
appears that another marvelous tal-
ent may be on the waneas a result
of hyper-exposure and corporate
influence.

At one point in the show, Cyndi is,

handed a flower wrapped in a paper

, cone. From it, she pulls a letter, to

her pleasure, and reads portions
aloud. We learn that the letter is
from ‘a young girl named Dana who
is upset because her mother won't
allow her to wear her hair like Cyn-
di's or adopt Cyndi’s dress code
because it's "too punky." Lauper's
reply: "It doesn't matter what you
wear; it's who you are.” She chuck-
les at her own modestly profound
response, giving the reason, "I

guess it's because the space.

between the back of my head and
my mouth is getting smaller." My
concern is that the space between

her tremendous talent and her '

media persona is getting far too
wide.

Fralic

By Man: A. Sindler
The Pitt News

HOUSTON —— It wasn't supposed
to end this way, not for Bill Fralic;
then again, many things weren't
intended to end the way they had for
the Panthers in l984. ‘

Last night at the Houston Rotar-
ian 15th annual Lombardi Awards
presentation — given each year to
honor the nation's top lineman'_—
the_ University of Texas’ Tony
Degrate received the 40-lb. block of
granite honoring the late coach
Vince Lombardi.

Earlier yesterday, as well as last
night, Fralic's thoughts focused on
what befell Lombardi and not the
award presentation before a crowd
of over 1,000 at the Shamrock Hil-
ton Hotel. For it was yesterday that

Fralic witnessed the burial of his _i

uncle Chuck Mahalik.
If Fralic so desired to win the
imposing trophy engraved with bold

letters with the word “Discipline,” it‘

was first for his uncle and secondly
for those close to him — those that
took a large degree of heat generated
by a 3-7-1 season. » . A
“The thing that .disappoints me
isn't [losing]," Fralic said last night.

I b As ﬁnals draw near, the Pitt wres-

tling team is finding it hard to field-a
team to compete .this weekend at
Lock Haven University’s.Mat Town
Invitational.

“We don’t usually compete in this
tournament because of ’ finals," said
head coach Rande Stottlemyer.

"them. However, it's just one of those
deals where the professors are
rescheduling their ‘finals’ and we
can’t expect the guys to give up their
academics. After all, that's why
they're here.

“We have 12 wrestlers slated to
compete, yet two of them are still
questionable’ at this point," con-
tinued Stottlemyer. “We'll just have
to do the best we can with what we

have.“ - * ~

Because of ﬁnals, theteam will be

lis as well as fierce competitors like”
John Throckmorton and Jack
Uppling. Also, as a result of an

goes unnoticed  

“As far as I'm concerned, there are a
lot tougher things I'm going
through. I would’ve liked to have
won this for everyone I'm associated
with, my friends ‘basically. It
could’ve also put the University of
Pittsburgh in a better light."

Last night, however, two glaring
stadium lamps shone on Degrate, a
hometown boy from Snyder, Texas.

“When I set my goals at the start
of the season, I walked into [Fred]
Aacher’s office, and he wanted me to
write down goals for the season,”
said Degrate. “It said to be named.
All-America. Then he said, ‘Just
that? What about the Lombardi?’-"

“I said, ‘Well, with Bill Fralic and
[Clemson's] William Perry, I didn't
figure I had much of a chance. By the
end of the season, I_ thought, ‘I guess
I could do it.’ "

That shouldn't serve to downplay
Fralic's unparalleled exploits as ‘a
lineman at Pitt. The three-time All-
America, only the second freshman
starter since Tony Dorsett, has
missed only two starts in four years.
The accomplishments read as if
from a scroll of parchment. Yet, a

degree of humbleness tempers the .

glory‘ of it all. -
“Everyone here would've.liked to

have won it," Fralic said. “Things
don’t always happen the way you
want them to. Everyone here is
rightly deserving of [the Lombardi].
It takes a lot of toughness dealing
with an uncle passing away after
something like that happens  "

The thought then switched to
something not as abstract. “Winning
football, that’s all I came to Pitt for.
We didn't win many this year. That's
what I felt disappointed about.
Tonight, this is what it's all about.-
Being with great people for a great
cause."

As for this past season, coach
Foge Fazio, also in attendance, said,
“Through badtimes and good times,
I'll say this: 1 don’t think we could
have made it without Fralic. Losing
doesn't bring out character, as they
say. The character shows when you
are losing. Bill Fralic is a fine exam-
ple for everyone. I want to thank

him for four wonderful years."’

Last night, Fralic squelched any
rumors that he hooked up with
noted sports agent Leigh Steinberg.
Though allowed to do so, Fralic
hasn't decided to sign with anyone as
the April 30 NFL draft approaches.
He said, “I really have no control
over it. The control I had coming
into the year was how I played."

The ‘Big Game’ is here 
for the Pitt hockey team

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News '

What do you want for Christmas?
The 6-1-l Pitt hockey team will
attempt to make the holidays a little
brighter Sunday by outshooting,
outplaying, and most importantly,
outséoring their toughest opponent,
10-0 Duquesne. None of the players
on Pitt's roster have seen a win over

'Duquesne but they hope to change
that this weekend.

“In all of my years of college
hockey I've never been on a team
that beat Duquesne. This will be an
emotional game for us,” said left
wing Jack Murphy. This game will
be especially significant for Murphy,
who after four years on the team,
will be playing his last game for Pitt
on Sunday before graduating later
in the month. ‘ ,

“It's going to hurt us a lot when he
[Murphy] leaves," said right wing
Roger Oldaker. “He's a real quality
player and he scores a lot of points."

Duquesne’s biggest threat to Pitt
lies in its strong offensive line. “They
have an excellent offense," said left
wing Jim Owens Jr. “Two of their
centers, Conway and Rupp, were on

"the All-Star team last year."

“Their offense is alittle better, but

think the teams are matched up
really equal. It'll be real close but I
think we're going to win," said
Oldaker. '

The Panthers have been anticipat-
ing this game since the beginning of
the season and concentrating on a
strategy to effectively utilize every
available resource against the
Dukes. “We know their strong
points,“ said co-captain Damon
Brown. “As long as we can execute
what we tried out in practice for. the
past few weeks we should be OK. We
know they don't like physical play,
so we're going to go out there and hit
them hard." -

“We'll all have to play together

and really play well," center Jim
Lang stated. “We won't get away
with just playing OK for a while and
then hope to pull out in the end."
Lang is a senior who has‘ never seen
Pitt defeat Duquesne, and he thinks
it’s about time. ' -

Young runners raise hope
for Pitt women’s track team

Byllllary Dalgle

ThePIttNews

As a rule. freshmen don‘t get
respect, but the freshmen on the Pitt
women's track team seem to be
exceptions to that rule. According to
Amy DiFrancesco. a junior on the
team, the team has a lot of new peo-
ple who are really making a
difference.

We‘ve got a very talented fresh-
man class.“ she said. “They are all
hard-working girls.“

The rookies got their first oppor-
tunity to “show their stuff" in a col-
lege meet this past weekend when
they traveled to Morgantown to
compete in the WVU Developmen-
tal Meet.

The team fared well in their initial
meet of the season. Marcella Duck-
ett, a freshman from Philadelphia,
took first in the 300-meter run, and
freshman Lisa Williams took second

in the I000-meter run.

The two-mile relay team, consist-

-ing of junior Sue Torre and fresh-
men Delilah Jackson, Dana Roberts
and Marcella Duckett, took second
place.

DiFrancesco contributed to the

meet by taking first place in the
I500-meter run.

Although the Pitt athletes enjoyed
much success at the meet, they still
felt the absence of senior All-
America Renee Henderson; During
the Thanksgiving break, Henderson
pulled a ligament in her foot.

“We expect that she'll be out for a
couple of weeks. We think that she
will be ready for the Big East Cham-
pionship in February,"DiFrancesco
said.

Henderson has been named the
Pitt team MVP for the last three
seasons. In addition, she has set
eight individual school and eight
meet records, including four Big
East Conference records.

With the exception of Hender-
son's injury, the team’s morale is
higher than last year, according to
Sue Torre.

Third-year head coach Elbert
Kennedy said, “It takes time to build
a program that has character,
growth and consistency."

“The new girls should do well if

theirifirst performance is any indica— '

tion for the rest of the season,”
DiFrancesco said.

Klafter beset by injuries

By Bob Travers

me Pitt News

 

Maybe the trick is simply not to
publicize Pitt's athletic elite. Pick

the football team to be No 1 -’- " ' ‘
cnatin" ° ""'

M, ,_ .. in {he
.-.. uuu tney go 3-7-l . Talk about
impending greatness from the has-
ketball team and they turn around
and lose to Xavier. And mention
gymnast Mark Klafter as an All-
America candidate and he caps an
injury-riddled 1984 with a torn rota-
tor cuff that will sideline him for a
month.

And xsv‘-' , v
_ __.. mien the books are laid
aside, Klafter ﬁnds time enough to
devote three hours a day to gymnas-
tics. What‘s a typical workout ses-
sion for him? “Well, I come in from
the beach, go through stretching out
exercises and some light warmups

for each event. Then, if voi_x‘;-3 gci- .
..£"_18. T¢ad.§’ TC? 3 ineet, I'll work on my

routine."

When it's finally iiﬁit 19 2'1! Elli‘-
work of endless afternoons in prac-
tice to use in a meet, the nervousness
hits. “The moment before you go out
there, right before you start your
routine, it's nerve-racking. But once
you start, your body takes over and
gives your mind a break. You want

events like the pommel horse, that
require a lot of control. But in the

floor exercise you don’t necessarily '

want to channel that energy, you
want it all for the routine.”

It is Klafter’s ﬂoor routine that is
"16 CFOWH j‘3‘.’-'51 of his performance.
it's {I}: one he went to Nationals
with last year and the one that is
expected to propel him there again
this year. It is pure energy. Klafter
on the floor exercise is Eh‘: §.mb0di-
ment of all that sport is supposed to
be. A brilliant, gifted athlete at his
best. When Klafter is on a roll he isa
work of art; he is poetry in motion.
But for the next month anyway, the
poet will not have much reason to
move at all.

my

to control all that nervous energy in
By the luck of the schedule, Pitt ‘ ‘ V
has only one meet_during that time,
the Buckeye Invitational this week-
end. The Panthers arenot in action
until Jan. 12, and Klafter expects to
be ready for that meet.

“Right now, it’s all more or less
experimental. I've had suggestions
for orthoscopic surgery, but there is
the possibility of this injury healing
just by resting it,” said Klafter.

'It‘s been that kind of a year for the
junior from Long Island, N.Y. Klaf-
ter is just now getting over the effects
of a sprained ankle that limited his
action during last Friday’s meet with
the Japanese team. '

“The ankle is OK now,“ he said,
but the shoulder has been a time
bomb, just waiting for the right
spark to set it off. The spark ignited
and the cuff tore. “The shoulder has
been bothering me all semester and
we just weren’tvcareful en.o‘ugh with
it. We let it go too long."

Any time an athlete suffers a
major injury there are also the men-
tal side effects that go with the physi-
cal problems. Will Klafter’s mind be
ready when his shoulder is? “I think
initially when I come back, the
injury will still be bothering me ,a
little bit. _It’s difficult worrying about
physical‘ pain 'while 'ti§?ihg also to
concentrate on a routine. I've been
careful to try not to think about
injury when I’m doing my routine;
You can't do that.”

Its a long way from the beaches of
Long Island to the snowy streets of
Oakland, but Klafter feels it was a
journey well worth taking. ‘‘I’m very
satisfied with Pitt," said the biology
major. “The university provides a

The Pitt News

Of the 28 teams that qualiﬁed for
NCAA championship tournament

'in women's volleyball. 27 will end

their seasons on a losing note. Last

. weekend Pitt lost to Nebraska (No.

7) and ended what was far from a
losing season for the three seniors on
the team, Pat Belcher, Ulana Kahu-
tiak and Cathy Rupp.

These spikers ﬁnished in the top
l0 percent of the nation's 240 Div-

ision 1 teams by winning 30 of 38‘

(.793 winning percentage) matches,
including 12 of their last 14 and a big
East Conference championship.

  

The Pitt News, Friday, December 7, 1984

They won 92 of I24 games in the
best-of-five matches. and defeated
then No. 7 Penn State and won the
prestigious Louisiana Classic.

With no seniors last season. the
team fared well but not extremely
so, ﬁnishing 3l-ll and failing to
retain the conference title from the
year before.

Nor was there any reason to bid
adieu to graduating players, as there

said Coach Shelton Collier.

with the team two years after
transferring from Ohio, where she
was discontented with the program,

“That’s got to be the neatest thing —

Hainessuffered a knee injury. Now,
after a total reconstruction of his
knee, the team is happy to have him
back, and hopes that he can obtain
the form that he exhibited as a
freshman.

The teams competing in the week-
end’s invitational include Lehigh
University, Michigan State, Ohio
University, _Old Dominion, the Uni-
versity of Tennessee and William
and Mary, as well as those teams
that they met at last week’s tourna-
ment: Penn State, Morgan State,
Slippery Rock, Temple and West

- Chester University.

“There will be a lot of good teams
competing in this invitational, which
should make it comparable to last
weekend’s tournament at’ Penn
State,” said-"assistant coach Jack
Spates. “We’re disappointed that we
can’t field" our ‘best team, because
once again an invitational like this

serves as a good opportunityrto“

gauge our progress.

“We have been working hard on
the thingsthat we_saw we were defi-  

cient of,” continued Spates, “and
now the guys are ready to go and

There’s no doubt that the Pan-
thers- are going to put all they have
into Sunday’s game. Defenseman
John Petit will be playing Duquesne
for the first time and he knows how
important this win is for Pitt. “If we
beat them, we can show that we’re
really pretty good,” Pettit said.

The Pitt skaters are optimistic and

feel that they have the talent to over- V '

come the Dukes. “We’ll have a good
hard practice Saturday and we’ll be
ready Sunday," said Owens. “Every-
one will be worried until that puck
drops. Duquesne is worried about
winning, too. This game will show us
who is the best. I think we’re going to
win —.— I can’t see them beating us.”

The Panthers will be playing on

their home ice at Lakevue on Route ‘

‘ 8 in .Valencia, which is also
Duquesne’s home ice. “lt’s a big dis-
advantage playing at Lakevue,
because that place is so far away. I
don’t think a lot of people even
know where it is. If we win this, it
could easily be our biggest win of the
season,” said Lang.

The Pitt women’s basketball
team dropped it's second deci-
sion of the year to West Virginia
Wednesday night. West Virgi-
nia’s front line proved to be too
much for the Lady Panthers as
WVU prevailed 77-63.

WVU was lead by forward Oli-
via Bradley who scored 18 points
and‘ pulled down 22 rebounds.
Georgianne Wells also chipped
in 18 points and 16 boards.

Pitt was lead by Jennifer Bruce
who tossed in 24 points with 15
rebounds. Kim Gannis added 12
off the bench and Lisa Fubio
chipped in with 10. '

The Lady Panthers dropped to
3-2, while the Lady Mountain-
eers upped their record to 5-1.

The University of Pittsburgh
plays host to the Colonials of Robert
Morris College this Saturday at 8:00
p.m. at Fitzgerald _Field‘I-louse.

The Panthers are 2-! so far this
year and will be looking for their

eighth consecutive victory over their

cross-town rivals. A

The Colonials are a young team
under first-year coach Jarrett Dur-
ham. Durham took over for Matt
Furjanic, who left for greener pas-
tures after building the program to
respectability.

Robert Morris is led by 6-6 senior
Tom Underman. Underman was a

factor in Robert Morris’ three con-
secutive post-season performances.
Joining Underman is Mark

Dobbs, a 6-5 senior, Roland Shan-

nonhouse, a 6-0 sophomore, Kenny
Williams, a 6-4 junior, and Fred
Cunningham, a 6-5 freshman.

Missed willbe the guard tandem"

of Chipper Harris and Bay Grant.

'Pitt will look to exploit the inexpe-

rience at guard and take advantage
of the size differential.

The Colonials are coming off a
five-point loss at West Virginia,

. while the Panthers are fresh off an

80-66 victory over Lafayette.
