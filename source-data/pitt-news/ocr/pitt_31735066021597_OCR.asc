Though his retirement settlement was a “sound

Posvar said he decided to give back over $1
million of his beneﬁts because he “deplores the

Trustees approve Posvar settlement

Yesterday the Board of Trustees compensation
committee, which was granted authority over
the matter by the full board, approved a settlement
with Posvar over his controversial multi—million
dollar retirement package.

The agreement calls for Posvar to pay back
$740,000 in low—interest mortgages by Jan. 31,
1992 andlowers his lifetime salary continuation
from $201,000 per year to $141,600 per year.

It also calls for Posvar to give the university
approximately $100,000 in cash from an insurance
policy purchased by the university to cover the

lock darmgﬁre scare

By Megan Bertino
Asst. News Editor

Ninth— and 10th-floor residents
of Holland Hall were shocked to
find the emergency—exit doors
locked when they attempted to
evacuate the building Monday
night after fire alarms were
activated.

The emergency door to the
catwalk from Holland Hall to
McCormick Hall failed to open
because “there was a malfunction
in the system  The alarm went
off and reset itself, causing the
fire doors to relock,” according to

.. Gary Moses, assistant director of

campus-‘police.

The fire alarm on the ninth
floor of Holland ‘Hall was
activated at 10:03 p.m. Monday
night. Campus police are unsure
of what caused the alarm, but
they suspect smoke from a
resident making popcorn, Moses
said.

Resident director for Holland
and Amos halls,’ Bernadette

/

Comfort, said sh'e_did not believe
the cause of theﬁre was popcorn
because the resident had prepared
it 45 minutes before the alarm
was activated. .

Comfort said she was unsure
what the actual cause was.

According to Comfort, the
building was evacuated, and
when she was informed that the
electronic door had
malfunctioned, she immediately
went to the 11th floor, where the
door is located.

She instructed a group of about
20 residents to evacuate down
the stairs. -

Comfort said she was not aware

of any similar ‘alarm mal-~

functions in the past, and she
immediately informed the main
Towers desk that the door failed
to open. ,

An engineer from Support
Services was immediately sent to
investigate the problem.

Documentstie Marous to Posvar package

By Megan Bertino

A Asst. News Editor

Chairperson of the Pitt Board
of Trustees John Marous denied
having full knowledge of former
Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
$3.3 million retirement package

but received and signed over a"

-dozen memos detailing the
settlement, according to the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

The ‘newspaper obtained 165 .

pages of confidential Pitt
“documents indicating thatJohn
Marous was aware of the details
of Posvar’s retirement fund.
_In 1987 Marous received a
memo from Towers Perrin, an
executive-benefit ﬁrm, listing
benefits Posvar received during
his tenure including salary,
retirement benefits, mortgage
benefits, deferred compen-
sation, insurance, club
memberships and the terms by
which Posvar’s retirement salary
would be formulated, the
Gazette reported. ‘
Marous told the Gazette that

BiGALA 

allege harassment

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pitt Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance members claim they
were‘ verbally threatened by Pitt
undergraduate Kevin Docherty
last week. =

They allege Docherty shouted
“Die fags” at them as they were

leaving the William Pitt Union

on Sept. 16. Docherty, who is
vice president of the College
Republicans and a member of
Students for Life, has denied the
charges.

‘‘I’d never say‘ something like
that,” Docherty said. “This is a

case of militant homosexuals '

trying to make a case against me.
I'm hurt.” ,

“The CR3 are not connected
with this in any way,” said CR
President Jacinta Dvorak.

BiGALA officer Mark Smith has
filed charges with Pitt's
affirmative—action office, said
Elaine Frampton of affirmative
action. Frampton said the incident
could be resolved‘ by informal
discussion between the two
parties, but Assistant Vice
President for Student Activities
Dennis Donham said the matter
could also be resolved by the
student judicial board. Frampton
said there is no written record of
the complaint.

“I think it_’s a positive way to

[register the complaintl," said

Director of Student Activities Joe

he did not recall seeing the
memo.

Also among the documents
were letters Marous had written
to Posvar, including one sent in
January 1988 giving Posvar a
$55,000 raise retroactive to July
1987.

The letter also told Posvar his
low—interest mortgage from the
University of Pittsburgh had
been increased to $740,000.

In 1989 Marous sent Posvar
another letter confirming the
mortgage benefit and wrote that
Posvar should use all of the
available mortgage funds
because he would ‘never have
to repay them.

Marous said he began to
question the full extent of
Posvar’s retirement package in
1989 and asked for a list of
Posvar’s benefits. Marous
claimed Posvar never provided
such alist.

The Gazette reported that in
1990 Marous authorized another

_,$5S,O00'raise for Posvar,

bringing his annual salary td

Cavalla. “It has nothing to. do .

with the’Republican club. [The

 

complaint] is against that student. 

But of course he’s innocent until 4
proven guilty  It’s one person’s

word against the other.”
BiGALA political-action chair

and Pitt graduate student Greg

Spicer said that Docherty said

“Die fags" ina “very angry tone of ‘
voice’’ last week as a group of six"

BiGALA members were leaving
the student union on the Fifth
Avenue side and Docherty was
walking in , I '
“I’m not making any judgments
about the College Republicans.

based on their membership. This .

is about being free to walk across

campus without being maliciously

verbally assaulted.” Spicer said.
Smith said they didn't know

who the assailant was until he  
recognized Docherty yeste‘rd'ay.'- ‘,-

at a CR voter-registration table. 9‘ , 
He said he updated the complaint L i ," ,

he made with affirmative action

on Sept. 16 by providing the 

name of the alleged defendant.
After BiGALA members
allegedly heard Docherty say,
“Die fags,” Spicer, Smith and Pitt
graduate student‘ Todd Keeler

 
 

followed Docherty into the‘ '

student union, where they found
him looking at the Jazz Hall of

Fame display. Pitt first-yearrf
student Matt Kittredge and the 9

other two members of the group
joined them soon after.

$325,000. .

According to the Gazette, 9
Posvar’s retirement salary would
be based on his earnings in his '
final three years as president,
according to the letter from
Towers Perrins.

Marous told the Gazettewhen
he gave Posvar the raises he did _
not consider the impact a salary
raise would have on Posvar’s
retirement fund.

Marous said that while all

benefits of Posvar’s retirement '
package were presented to him,
he failed to read some memos
he signed.
. Marous also said he did not
fully realize the entire
retirement package because it
was not all presented to him at
once.

General Counsel of Pitt and ,1  0.

secretary of the Board of
Trustees Lewis Popper said he
was not shocked because “Mr.
Marous had said in June that he
did not know the full scope of
the package but that he should

have and wished he did.”

university IDS to use Macintosh
computers at Pitt computing
labs. ‘

“We have converted all Macs
to a self-booting system,” said
Daniel Temple, director of
Academic Computing.

Before the new system, Mac
users had to wait in line for lab
operators to give them start-up

* disks in exchange for university
AIDS.

Now students can go
directly to a Mac and use it
without going through an
operator.

“We think it’s friendly to the

programmers can be converted,
and [students] can get print—outS
faster,” said David Schatz,
manager of Computing Lab

Services.

“The machine boots slower.
But the question is ‘IS it slower
than having to stand in line?”’
Temple Said.

“lltl deﬁnitely gives us more
time for consulting work, in
addition to filing the output,”
said Hugh Docherty, a David
Lawrence lab operator.

“One of the big disadvantages
is there’s no waiting list. So if
you are lucky enough to be by
someone who’s almost done,
you can get in sooner than
someone who’s been waiting
for a long time,” saidjon Ramsey,
another David Lawrence
operator. ,

Schatz said he did not know if
crowding around computers
would be a problem but hoped
students would “act like ladies
and gentlemen. The machines
at [Carnegie Mellon] are all self-
booting, and there haven’t been
any problems.”

“I think it’s working pretty
good so far  You can look
around. There’s open computers
everywhere. There’s even
computers up at Scaife [Hall] 
When everyone has to write a
mid-term paper, that’s when it’s
really crowded. But like now,
because things are just getting
Started, it’s not so bad,” said
George Zula, a fourth—year Pitt
pharmacy student.

“No one has come to me with
problems,” said Sharon Swaney,
a computer—user advocate for
students.

_ Although students do not
need a CAPS account now or a
global account to access a Mac
or to print from a Mac, such
procedures may be required in
the near future.

For the present time, users
may simply click cancel twice at
the -global-network account
screen.

“We don’t really have a Set

schedule yet, but we encourage
students to get an account,”
Temple said.

“I’m waiting until they start
enforcing it because otherwise,
when this first screen comes on,
you just hit cancel,” Zula Said.

’ “The start-up disks are locked.
The drives are also locked. There

haven't been any problems with

people interfering with the
software,” Hillman Lab
Supervisor Della Williams said
about non-university users
having access to Macs.

The original purpose of the
self-booting Mac system was to
allow Macintoshes on the

CGS president strives to change negative image of  

By Sandy Lasswell
For The Pitt News

Marcie Roberts lives in two
very different worlds.
‘ At home she trains horses for a
livingand takes care of her three
children. At Pitt she is a full—time

' College of General Stu dies student

and president of the CGS Student
Government Council.

Roberts, 32, said she is actually
grateful for the hour—and—a—
quarter drive from home to school
because it provides time to shift
from training horses to working
with students.

‘She started as an External
Studies student at Pitt in 1989,
when she was pregnant with her
third child. Once she even
brought newborn Matthew to a
workshop.

Although she started out as a
part—time student, most terms she‘
has taken at least 12 credits and
maintains a high honors average.

Since her major is legal studies,
many people ask her if she wants
to go to law school.

“I don't think I_want to be a
lawyer, but I would like to go to
law school just to do it,” Roberts
said. “I would love to have the
education and degree.”

After her graduation in August
or December 1992, Roberts may
try to land a job in county
government. If she does decide
to go to law school, it will have to

‘wait until Matthew begins first

grade, she said.

Last Monday Roberts arrived at
Pitt about 11:30 a.m., had a
meeting with members of a
student organization in Langley
Hall at noon, went to class in the
Public Health Building at 1:00,
met with a Senate Council
committee at 3:00, attended a
reception in Bruce Hall at 5:00
and went to class at 5:45. ' \

At home she doesn’t get to
sleep until midnight.

Up again by 5:30, Roberts puts
in a load of wash (even though
she says she doesn't do
housework), sends Robbie, 12,
and Adam, 6, off to school and
-’hits the books a little.

. She explains‘ that she has

‘ learned to study whenever she

has a spare minute, using
cookbook stands to hold
textbooks so she can read while
doing something else.

“I feel special to be able to live

and work where I do,” she said. I

“Highview is on a ridge, which is
the highest open point in Li gonier.
You can see all over the highlands
from there. It is absolutely
beautiful country.”

Hi ghview not only has 50 horses
and numerous cats but also a
herd of sheep, which is kept for
training dogs.

The summer she was pregnant
with Matthew and started school,

she played midwife to 12 mares.

Often she spent the night curled
up in a sleeping bag next to a
mare which was about ready to
give birth.

Roberts was due to have her
third child in July and one of the
mares was due the first part of
August. '

Bets were placed as to which
one would give‘ birth first. It

~  NEWS, Thursday, Septemberl26, 1991'

  

turned out that a very pregnant
Roberts helped the mare to deliver
in July and Matthew wasn’t born
until August.

“Sometimes I want to put a sign
at the end of our long, driveway
saying, ‘We Deliver,”’ said
Roberts. Although Robert’s job is
to train the show horses, her
husband, Bob, is the farm
manager who takes care of the
hay crop and runs the operation.
Bob also takes care of the kids
while Roberts is away.

“He has been very under-
standing and supportive,” she
said. '

‘‘I couldn’t do what I do without
his help.”

Roberts first got involved with
student organizations when she

became a charter member of‘

Lambda Alpha Epsilon, a
nationally recognized American
Criminal Justice Association.

She has served as both vice
president and president of that
group. ”

She has also sat on the Judicial

Review Board and is currently a
member of the Provost Committee
for Undergraduate Programs. She
estimates she spends 20 to 25

vhours a month in committee

meetings. ~

As president of CGS Student
Government Council, Roberts
sees her job as relating the
needs and concerns of CGS
students to the administration as
“effectively and diplomatically”
as possible.

“I love to talk to people,” she
said, “I like to feel as though I am
being heard.”

She said the non-traditional
student population at Pitt is
decreasing because these students
are more concerned about how
their money is used than students
who came to college directly from
high school.

“Now that we have ‘a new
president, we have a golden
opportunity to improve the
perceived status of CGS within
the university community,”
Roberts said. 9

Spicer asked Docherty if he

' had threatened them outside the

union, and Docherty denied it,
according to Spicer, Smith and
Keeler. Spicer apologized, and
Smith said “Maybe he’s the wrong
guy,” when Docherty admitted
he had made the comment,
according to Spicer and Keeler.
“We were about ready to go
when [DochenyI perked up and
said, ‘Yes, I said, “Die Fags,””’
Keeler said. ' ,
According to Spicer,
“IDochertyl said, ‘What if I did
say it? It’s free speech.’ And later
he said — I remember this

' verbatim — ‘All youse fags are

going to die of AIDS.’ We started
raising our voices; he was
obviously very angry. I asked
him, ‘Why are we going to die?’
‘Because you're fags,’ [Docherty]
said. ‘It’s against nature, and it’s
against God  I agree with what

— Hitler did [to homosexuals]  I

wish he had killed you all,’’’

Spicer said. A
“It was threatening. It was
blatantly hateful," Kittredge said.
“I definitely felt threatened by
what he said,” Spicer said.
Kittredge and Smith told 7bePitt
News similar versions of Spicer’s
and Keeler’s accounts.

Docherty said he did speak ,

with the BiGALA members in the
Jazz Hall of Fame, but he didn’t
meet them outside the union and
say “Die fags.”

“No I didn’t, but people are

- allowed to say whatever they

want,” Docherty said. “We did
exchange words, and I was
verbally accosted. I was looking
at the [Jazz Hall of Fame], and a
big guy [Spicer] comes over and
said, ‘Did you just say something
to us?’ and I said, ‘What ifI did?”’
Docherty said.

and one of me. I felt physically
threatened. I said AIDS is killing
a lot of homosexuals. I didn’t say,
‘Die homos die.’ I don’t
understand the whole thing,”
Docherty said.

Docherty said‘ that he felt
threatened by the BiGALA
members.

“The main guy that was in-my
face [Spicer] was 6’4" and 250
pounds. What could I do? I walked
away.” Spicer said he is 6’2" and
weighs 225 pounds.

“There is a sign on the BiGALA
office door that says, ‘Queers

threatened. I thought it might be

' hetero_—bashing. ” ‘

According to Spicer and
Kittredge, Docherty Said, “You
guys don’t even belong here.
You shouldn’t even be here.”

Spicer said after the
conversation ended, Docherty

walked quickly away as the

BiGALA, members shouted.

“coward” and “bigot" at him.
Dennis Donham, assistant vice

president for student affairs, said
' that penalties for the alleged

offense could range from “a
warning or reprimand to dismissal
[from the university], depending
on the full nature of the
circumstances.” I

If either party does not agree
with the affirmative action office's
decision, they can appeal to the
judicial board, Donham said. “My
reaction would be to send [the
matter] to the judicial board. I
feel that such behavior is
unacceptable.”

“Free speech is encouraged by
this university,” Donham said,

noting that the student code of

conduct enables students to
“engage in discussion.”
But the code prohibits “threats,
‘ intimidation or coercion  as
well as discrimination on the
basis on sexual orientation,”
according to Donham. .

“Someone’s going to have to
rely on the First Amendment. I
don’t think people can hide under
the FirstAmendment about things
like Iharassmentl,” he said.

Docherty said the incident is
indicative of a nationwide
“political correctness” crackdown
on free speech.

“If we're not even allowed to
engage in conversation without
fearing a reaction, this is
dangerous,” he said. '“A few
subversives are undermining the
system to their benefit. If people
aren’t allowed to talk, what kind
of country are we living in?”

Spicer, Kittredge and Keeler
said Docherty’s alleged comment
did not represent legitimate
“political discourse” because
Docherty did not intend to engage
in a debate about the issue of
homosexuality.

“He didn’t confront us,”
Kittredge said. “He looked down
as he said, ‘Die faggots.’ He wasn’t
saying, ‘Look guys, can I talk to
you about how much I really hate
homosexuals?” “It’s not
valuable political speech,” Spicer
said. “The campus community
has a stake in creating a space
where people don’t feel
threatened  if they’re walking
in front of the student union. For
him to disagree with us is fine.
For him to tell us we deserve to
die at least deserves to be
confronted  If we don’t say
anything, his comments can go
unattended, just like Hitler.”

 ‘Board of Trustees Chairperson John Marous thinks it will

« .n..4...-v-u . .-7 2

workfor him, too.
A’ “I don’t know, “I don’t recall” and “I don’t remember”
have become the anthemsvof officials who attempt to hide

 information they don’t want anyone to know that they ‘
 were aware of.

After the specifics of ex-Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s

1' retirement’ package were announced, Marous sent a letter
to “the university community” in which he stated that “I
« should have been more questioning.”

Quite an ironic statement for someone who knew all
and asked nothing. _

165 pages of Pitt documents concerning Posvar’s package’
dating back to 1967 that were signed either by Marous or
other Pitt officials were obtained by The Pittsburgh Post
Gazette and presented to Marous on Tuesday.

Even after reading (or re-reading) the memos, Marous

still claimed he didn’t recall seeing the documents at any '

other time. He also said, “neither did any of the other
people on the board  or they would have said something
to me.” '
Perhaps someone did say something. Perhaps the
reason Marous did nothing to stop Posvar’s plundering of
Pitt funds for his own benefit is because Marous did not
realize the full impact the package would have on not

, only the Pitt community but the city of Pittsburgh as well:

Marous_ has’ more power at the University of Pittsburgh
than is indicated by his title. In fact, he has even more
influence and input regarding what happens at Pitt than

 even President O’Connor does.

Is it possible, then, for someone so untrustworthy to
lead us into the “new era of openness’_’ Pitt so desperately

A needs?

Sadly, no. His half—truths have been mounting and are
becoming more asinine as the days go on. “I could swear
on a stack of Bibles, of all the'ad hoc committees we’ve
had on salary, we've never talked about retirement or the
impact of any decision on retirement.” Marous also
told the Post-Gazette that he didn’t know all of the
retirement perks until the public announcement in June.
Are we to believe this, too?

With all of the controversy surrounding Pitt, one would
think that Marous would at least be a little more subtle
about the whole situation.

If one dollar were taken off each Pitt student’s tuition for
every half-truth that has been told to us by the administration
in the past six months, tuition would no doubt decrease
substantially. For a school as large as Pitt, this is a very
pathetic (yet hopeful) dream.

The Bill of Rights is under attack, and I’d bet that
most of you don’t realize it. As Iwarned last spring,
the passage of the Brady bill has given gun-control
advocates the green light to introduce legislation
that would totally ignore the Second Amendment.
There are bills in Congress right now that would
grossly restrict gun ownership, implement full-
scale registration and set the stage

sary

to get permission from the government to.hold a
protest? When was the last time you had to get
permission to have a fair trial? I’ hate to break it to
some people, but the Second Amendment is just as
important as any other. '

The biggest crock is the myth about gun control
reducing violent crime. Years of FBI and police
statistics have proven beyond a

Gun-control advocates base

their arguments on a -totally

fallacious view of the Second

Amendment. The Second
Amendment states, “A well—regulated militia, being
necessary to the security of a free state, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.” Gun- control nuts say that this only
applies to organizations such as the National Guard.
But this lie becomes apparent when you look at
some of the writings of the Founding Fathers.

“Firearms stand next in‘ importance to the
Constitution itself. They are the American people’s
liberty teeth and keystone under independence 
“ That quote didn’t come from the National Riﬂe
Association; it came from George Washington.
Samuel Adams said that the “Constitution should
never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent
the people of the United States who are peaceable
citizens from keeping their own guns.” So the
argument that the right to bear arms only applies to
an organized militia is totally false.

Another approach used by gun-control loonies is
the one about the right to bear arms being a
privilege. How can it be a privilege when it is a
constitutional right? Many have been conned into
thinking that it wouldn't be such a bad thing if
people had to get permission to buy firearms. But
think about this: When was the last time you had

citizens are banned from owning
or carrying firearms to defend themselves. The
murder rate there is absolutely horrendous! You
don’t see wholesale slaughter in cities like Pittsburgh,
where citizens are permitted to keep and bear
arms. One study asked 1,900 inmates of federal
prisons about armed victims. Almost 60 percent
said that they wouldn’t even consider bothering
someone if they thought they were armed.

The real problem is with foolish liberals who
scream whenever they think any other amendment
is under attack but believe that the Second
Amendment can just be ignored.

The foolishness and the blatantly obvious liberal
bias of the media keep the American people in the
dark about the realities of gun control. The American
people have a right to defend themselves because
it’s obvious the police aren’t doing the job. The
problem lies with criminals. Let’s do away with
today’s lenient, slow-moving judicial system and
replace it with something that deals with criminals
swiftly and effectively. Something is drastically
wrong here because we are the only country in the

. world trying to restrict our own Bill of Rights.

The women's tennis team had
been rolling and the ‘men had just

‘had a rough tourney, but both

teams came away’ with victories
over Youngstown State
Wednesday at the Cost Center.

The women’s team stayed
undefeated, improving its record
to 7-0, with an 8-0 win over YSU.
In singles action, Julie LoPrinzi
cruised overJulie Lemay 6-0, 6-0,
and Erika Devins had a tiny bit of
frustration but came away
victorious, defeating Tarra
Pavlosky 6-3, 6-2.

Raquel Cepeda won her match

6-3, 3-0, when her opponent,
Cindy Lane, retired in the second
set due to an aggravated toe injury.
“The trainer let some pressure off
the toe earlier this morning so we
could get her ready to play,” said
YSU Coach Don Getz,” but the
toe started to bleed in the middle
of the match, and we didn’t want
to damage it any further.”

In other singles action, Jennifer
Jacobs won easily, beating Jen
DiPasqua 6-0, 6-1, while Colleen
Kujawski used consistent
backcourt play to defeat Jill
Haniford 6-1, 6-1. There was no
sixth match because YSU only
brought five players.

In doubles action, pro-set

matches were played because
Pitt swept the singles matches
and both coaches agreed under
the rules to speed things up.
LoPrinzi and Devins Continued
their reign by trouncing Lemay
and Pavlosky 10-1, while Gwen
McIntyre and Chris Orie saw
action, beating DiPasqua and
Haniford 10-2.

Coach George Dieffenbach said
that the dramatic turnaround from
last year’s loss to YSU (S-4) can
be attributed to the fact that “they
stayed the same, and we got
about twice as strong,”

This weekend unveils not only
a new golf course to a worldwide
audience but also a renewed effort
by the United ‘States to regain its

supremacy in the international '

golf community. ,

The winner of the Ryder Cup,

power in the game of golf.

designed specifically for this
event. It features a view of the
ocean from 16 of the 18 holes. It
is planned in a links-style format,
a departure from other Dye
layouts.

The competition itself is scored
on a point—per-match basis, with
one point awarded for a win and
half a point to each opponent for
a tie.

The. contests began: in‘ 1927

_ Chris Bouyer has emerged as
the “salty veteran” of Pitt’s

a receiving corps.

, This from a wideout who had

. 10 career receptions for 97 yards

and 0 touchdowns entering the
1991 season.
That’s right. The redshirt junior

A from Detroit was expected to

provide leadership and stability
for a young and inexperienced
crew, and he has done just that.

‘“I’ve wanted to prove to the J
 coaches and players that I could

play. I just needed the chance,”

E . V Bouyer said.

Bouyer has ﬁlled the large shoes

3 I of Olanda T ruitt as the featured

receiver in the Panther offense

‘ by grabbing eight passes for 158

yards and three touchdowns in
the first three games. That’s an
average of 19.8 yards per catch.

“I've waited a long time for this
opportunity to come,” Bouyer
said. “Redshirting my sophomore

5 year messed up my rhythm. The

yearl sat out, I lost conﬁdence. I

 thought I had a pretty good camp
this year, and I’ve‘ got a lot of

confidence back.”
At the end of fall camp in ’89
Bouyer suffered an ankle injury

6 that lingered on until he was

redshirted early in the season.
Last season he played in all 11
games, serving mostly in a backup

‘ role.

Unsure Gopher defense

faces Pitt this Weekend

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Minnesota defense gave up 38 points last week.

That should be good news for Pitt, but head coach Paul
Hackett is still worried. A

“We mightbe getting setup,” he said, referring to the tendency
of a humiliated defense to rebound at home. This is precisely the
case this weekend, when Pittfaces the Gophers in the Metrodome.

Humiliating is one way to describe Minnesota’s defensive
performance against Colorado last Saturday. “Disastrous,” said
Minnesota Coach John Gutekunst. “We have to face up to
reality.”

The reality of Gutekunst’s defense is that it has given up 78
points in two games, allowing 34 in the second quarter alone.
Minnesota’s opponents have rolled up 1,075 yards in total
offense, an average of 221 yards on the ground and 316 in the
air. -
“Colorado beat us with the play-action pass,” Gutekunst said,
“and we fell behind early.” Indeed, when the Gophers keyed on
the option attack led by Darian Hagan, they got burned in the
secondary. '

“They simply overplayed the option,” Hackett said. .“It was

not an indication at all of their defense.”

Potentially, this defense can be successful. It has several
outstanding individual performers at linebacker and in the
secondary. The unquestioned leader is senior strong safety Sean
Lumpkin; Big, fast and experienced, Lumpkin has 18 tackles (17
solo) and two pass deflections. “Sean is very intense,” Gutekunst
said. “He sets the tone for our defense."

A four—year starter and second—team All-Big 10 member last
year, Lu mpkin is considered a pro safety prospect, with his size
(213 pounds) and tackling ability. ‘ .

The rest of the secondary has been victimized this season. As
a unit, the‘ defensive backs have made nearly as many tackles
in two games as Pitt’s secondary has in three games.

The linebacking crew is also high on the tackling list, and in
a 4-3 defense like the one Minnesota employs, this is not a great
sign. Andre Davis is the team’s leading tackler from his middle
linebacker spot.‘The outside ‘backers, senior Joel Staats and
soph Russ Heath are opposites. Staats isn’t especially quick, but
he is a steady player, while Heath is small (218 pounds) but
quick. . .

The front unit isgunusual for a 4-3 setup. The largest member
istackle Gary Isakson, a 277-pound senior. Ben Williams, a
converted linebacker, is a pass-rushing end who has good

' lateral speed but only weighs 245 pounds.

4 The smallest person on the line is tackle Dennis Cappella,
who is all of 223 pounds. The Minnesota line has its work cut
out for itself this weekend. They have yet to register a sack, and
they face a unit which has yet to allow one. ~

weather should be nice in 
Other than that, we don’t advise
watching this ‘game, only laying
cash on it. A

If magic could be captured in

a bottle, the Pack would be a-

playoff club, but their Majik has

‘ all vanished, leaving Coach Lindy

Infante with big trouble. Don
Majikowski agave Miami Coach
Don Shula his 300th win on
Sunday by fumbling the ball in
his own end zone, with no
Dolphins even close to hitting
him, and basically-looking like a
real stiff. He was 19 of 36 for 238
yards last week.

The Pack rushing attack may
even be worse. Majikowski led
them with 33 yards rushing against
Miami, andhe ain't no Randall.
Keith Woodside and Vince
Workman tote the ball for this
club, and they could very well be
the worst backfield in 10 years.

The Rams are also sad. Jim
Everett has set a new league
record by going from the league’s
best passer two years ago to now
being one of the five worst. Four
games into the year and Everett
has 0, repeat, 0 touchdown passes}

_ He has thrown for only 601 yards,

including a stellar 71-yard effort
two weeks ago vs. New Orleans.
He should forget about the elite
for now and worry about
surpassing Schroeder as the best
QB in LA. The running_game
should be fine, but the injury to
burner Flipper Anderson will
ground him and the awful Everett
passing game for at least four
weeks.

Defense begins with tackling,

something LA doesn’t do very

well. Maybe they were never
taught properly, but they missed
so many tackles in the San Fran
game that defensive coordinator
Jeff Fisher is probably begging to
go back to Philly. After a
promising game with the Giants
they are ranked No. .18 right now
and are ready to revert to the
matador style they’re known for.

After ripping into both--(clubs,

we like LA. Why? They have a '

running game capable of handling
the Packers, and they’re at home.
As bad as Everett has been, five
weeks without a TD for him is
stretching it a bit. Gary is returning
to form, so trust us on this. Just do
not watch this game, butTakeI.A

Since its inception in 1955, the United States lost in the
biennial competition only twice, in 1957 and 1975.

In recent years, however, the Americans claim as the world’s
power in golf can be debated. The 1985 United States team lost
to the Europeans 16.S~11.S. The Europeans successfully defended
their crown in 1987, 15-13. The cup stayed in Europe another
two years after the two battled to a draw at The Belfry in
England in 1989.

This year’s matches have not even begun, and the controversy
has started. ‘

Before the Europeans left for America, they threw a few snide
comments directed toward the U.S. team. Woosnam questioned
the leadership of the American team, which is comprised
mainly of younger players.

Stockton has taken most of this in stride. He responded in the
Charleston (SC) News and Courier by saying, “The Europeans
have two or three players who think they are the team leader.”

Also, Wednesday night three limos carrying players were

involved in an accident. American team member Payne Stewart '

was taken to a Charleston area hospital to be examined.

*' "“I had no clue anything like
 this would happen. I wasn’t
. guaranteed a starting position. I

wasn’t guaranteed anything,” the
native of Scott Township said.
As for his size, Prex believes

his smaller stature can be an
- advantage at times.

He said he is “pretty quick,”
which allows him to get around
people. But to become a stronger
soccer player, Prex knows he has
to work hard.

“Over the summer I lifted a lot

more. I actually put on about 10
pounds,” Prex said.

“He’ll get bigger and stronger,"
said Luxbacher. "He’s never been
on a weight program before, so
he’ll only get better.”

Prex will need the extra bulk to
survive the rugged Big East
schedule. ‘According to Prex,
playing soccer in college is very
different from high school.

“In high school you have a lot
oftime to control the ball. You’ve
got to be quick here. Ifnot, you’ll
be laying on your back,” said the
Chartiers Valley graduate.

Prex, however, had help in
adapting to his new surroundings

at Pitt. He credited sophomore
linemate Ted Noethling,, with
helping him gain confidence.
Between the two of them, they’ve
accounted for over 60 percent of
Pitt’s goals.

Prex was one of Pitt’s top
recruits coming out of Chartiers
Valley High School. Not only did
he lead the \X/PIAI. in scoring last
year, but he also broke the
school’s record for goals in one
season (47) and career goals (101).
He was named All-State and a
regional All-American in his senior
year

was closer to home and it was the
“best deal.” He received a partial
scholarship from Pitt.

“Also, a lot of other coaches
called me all the time. I had to
leave the house just to get away
from it. Coach Luxbacher wrote
me letters and told me to take my
time. He was very nice and didn’t
pressure me like the others,” Prex
said.

Luxbacher thus far has to be
more than pleased with the play
of his prized recruit.

“Eric remains calm in any
situation. He doesn’t get flustered.
He’s very good at keeping his
cool,” Luxbacher said. “But he’s

not going to score all those goals
here (like in high school). He still
has a lot to learn.” _

Prex cites defense as the area
he must work on most to become
a better player.

“Deﬁnitely defending,” he said.

Prex will have to continue to
improve if he is to reach his goal
of becoming All-Big East and
reaching the NCAA tournament
someday. With Prex’s start,
Luxbacher believes his future is
promising.

THE PITFVNEWS, Thursday, September 26, 1991

 

lllinoi‘ze’ uglies’ infectuous grooves 

Continued from cover
the practice of tongue waggling)

and an endless assortment of

drug-soaked on—stage hilarities.
Hell, they’ll probably be hitting a
tree-trunk-sized bong throughout
the‘ entire show. Cum laude
graduates of the sex, tons of
drugs and punk—rock school of
thought, The Didjits have been
hot-rodding and statutory raping
their way across our country’s

“ . lands, air waves and turntables

since the early—mid ’80s. No
stranger to drunken fist fights,
endless touring and consumer
apathy, The Didjits are finally
getting their full due — and they
deserve it, too, bubba.

Their first Touch ‘n’ Go release,
Hey judester, stands as one of the
best pure punk-rock records of
the ’80s, maybe (gasp) ever! A
mammoth three—chord (with the

monster, judeslerstands as a total
and complete snarling paragon;
a-model, as it were, ofwhat three
bored guys with extensive late
’70s punk—rock record collections
can accomplish. Not much brains,
hell, talent, for that matter. Just
three dirty minds and one overall
misanthropic attitude. Kudos!
Ric, Doug and Joe’s return to
the table, I-Iornet Pinata, proved

-to be more of the same, only

more so maybe. A louder, more-
sonic attack even! Nice song titles,
too: “Sweet, Sweet Satan,” “Mr.
Policeman” and “Evil Knieviel.”
Of course there’s even less
diversity in H0r'netPthan in their

previous effort, but so what’ It all

sounds like one song to you; the

‘only variance being that Rick

P llllNl Flllllllll Pliiitlllill llllll
Slllll lllllllllll llllllflll llllililll ' Hlllllfl JANE

swinging solo) ‘

sometimes takes the same
chord(s) up or down an octave or
two for each new song, you say?
Well, let it be all one song then;
a song that says, “hey, back up,
little trooper, and take a hit. It’ll
be okay.”

Though I would have to confess
that the Didjits’ newest, Full
Nelson Reilly, has seen the least
amount of rotation of their four
total records, Reilly is the loudest
and most raucous of the bunch.

It’s also pretty sloppy. Whereas
the Didjits used to amaze you
with their tight, in- control guitar
workmanship, their stop—on—a—
dime rhythm changes and their
almost jazzy solo flourishes, the
Didjits have (since Hornet
Pinata, one could say) slowly
evolved ,(de—evolved, if you will)
into a less polished, more noisy,
loudish approach. It has a lesser,
yet just as much on—the—edge feel.
And this ain’t bad. Songs like
“'l'lie Haunted House On The
Hill" and covers like “Mr. DNA”
are really done up strong,
crunchy. Like as ifyou could bite
into ‘em. Niiiice. »

Anyone who’s ever heard a
Didjits record or even read one of
their lyric sheets can attest that
these three goofs have a pretty
considerable appetite and
aptitude for wine, women and
drugs (mostly weed, it would
seem). And they like cars. Loud
ones, with engines the size of
Trump Towers.

And that’s what they sing about
— getting wasted and having sex
whilst speeding down the road
really freakin’ fast. Yeah! Car/
drug/girl- related songs like “Top

endless references (especially on '

Reilly) to that substance do grow
pretty tiresome after about two
minutes.-But as for the songs
about booze, girls and cars 
thumbs up to that totally.
Nobody whose opinions matter

would ever consider the Didjits

to be less than a must—see live..
Simply put, they’re kinda great.

One hour’s worth ofbarelyl

controlled mayhem, coupled with
a pretty severe contact buzz, is
definitely more than the
equivalent of the price of a ticket
and maybe a T-shirt.

By Rob Pugliesel
Sla‘[]"WriterI ‘

Once again, this is it; turn it up.
The city of Pittsburgh could have
its foundation shattered on Oct:2
when rap demigods Public Enemy
and thrash-metal kings Anthrax
blow into town with cyclone
force. In addition to the co-
headliners of this “Bring the
Noise” tour, the audience will be
treated to (or probably be
sickened by) the alternative
sounds ofPrimus and the rhyming
style of Young Black Teenagers.

Public Enemy and Anthrax go
back many years, and the
superpowers recently colla-
borated on a new version of
Enemy’s classic “Bring The Noise”
cut from their 1988 LP It Ta/E2e5A
Nation Of Millions To Hold U5
Bac/e. On the new version,
Anthrax applies its icy metal edge
behind Chuck D’s rhymes, with
Anthrax rhythm guitarist Scott Ian
assisting Chuck with some
rhyming of his own on the last
two verses. The track appears on

Anthrax’s latest release, Attacle of 4

the K1'llerB’s and will also appear
at the end of PE’s forthcoming
release Apocalypse ’9J.- The
EnemySm'/eesBlac/e, due out early
next week. '

Public Enemy is widely
regarded as one of the most
powerful forces in the entire world
of music. They entered the scene
in 1987 with the debut LP Y0!
Bumrush The Show, which gave
us only a taste of their brilliance
on tracks like “Miuzi Weighs A
Ton,” “You’re Gonna Get You rs,”
“Time Bomb” and, of course,
“Public Enemy No. 1." However,
critics and fans alike were not
overwhelmed completely until
1988 brought us the highly
acclaimed and controversial
Nation 0fMz'll1'0ns . .. , the best rap
album of all time, in my opinion.
Chuck D., the lyrical terrorist and

messenger of prophecy, hitstrong ,

and explosive, political blasts on
everything from racial persecution
to black militancy to false media
hype. His voice is a deep rumble,
an automatic weapon, dropping
science-like bombs from a B-52.
This album produced the classics
“Rebel Without A Pause,” “Night
of the Living Baseheads,” “Black
Steel In The Hour Of Chaos” and
“Don’t Believe The Hype,” but
absolutely every song on this
record is slammin’.

The hard rhymer’s sidekick is
Flavor Flav, one of the silliest
characters to grace the industry,
complete with gold tooth, massive
clock draped around his neck

and his own dances. Chuck is the
bass and the Flav is the treble.
The sound provider is Terminator
X, known to PE fans as the assault
technician. Terminator X cuts it
up and scorches the turntables
like no other DJ on the planet.
Scratch from EPMD, Richie Rich
of 3rd Bass and Eric B are the
only Djs who even come close.
Check out “Terminator X Speaks
With His Hands” from the debut
album. The heavy sound, laden
with boomin’, dense beats,
background noise, sirens and lots
of creative sampling, comes
courtesy of production crew, “The
Bomb Squad,” composed of
Chuck D., Hank and Keith
Shocklee, Carl Ryder and Eric
“Vietnam” Sadler, although others
have worn the Bomb Squad hat.
These guys get major props for

totally reshaping the hip-hop
world as we know it.

The militant reality of PE is
exemplified with their security
force, The Security of the First
World. The S1Ws, dressed in
military camouﬂage or black and
gold PE jackets, add another
intimidating dimension to an
unbelievable stage show. Their
former leader and minister of
information, Professor Griff, was
dismissed from the group shortly
before the album Fear OfA Blacle
Planet was released in 1990, due
to anti—semitic-comments he made
to Washington, D.C., reporter
David Mills. Chuck D. defended

' Griff originally, but he later asked

him to leave.
Many skeptics hollered that this

end for the Enemy. Wrong they
were. The next single, “Fight
the Power” for Spike Iee’s movie
“Do The Right Thing," became
an anthem. Fear Of A Blacle
Planet had the unenviable task
of following up Nation of
Millions, but came through in
strong fashion. The first single,
“Welcome To The Terrordome,”
is one of the loudest, fullest PE
songs to date. According to

‘ Chuck D., “Terrordome” is about

his view of the world entering
the 19905, as seen through the
eyes of a black man. Hestarts
by saying, “I got so much trouble
on my mind/ refuse to lose” in
response to all of the controversy
that had nearly engulfed the
band. He then makes. it clear
where he stands on the Griff
and anti—semitism issue, dissing
the critics who put aside his
apology as insincere.
“Crucifixion ain’t no fiction/ so-
called chosen frozen/ apology
made to whoever pleases/ still
they got me like Jesus.”

Other cuts that did serious
damage were “Brothers Gonna
Work It Out,”,a call for unity
among blacks, “Burn Hollywood
Burn,” shredding the movie
industry for false portrayal of
blacks and “Who Stole The
Soul?”

Anthrax’s Attacle of tbe Killer
B’sis a compilation of live tracks,
covers, b-sides and previously
unreleased songs. This is
Anthrax’s seventh full-length
release since its debut-in .1983.
In addition, they released an EP

entitled I’m The Man in 1987. 0

Hailing from New York City,
Anthrax is Ian, Dan Spitz on
lead guitar, Frank Bello on bass,
Charlie Benante on drums and
Joey Belladonna on vocals. It all
began with Fistﬁtl ofMetal, the
debut in ’83, followed by Armed
and Dangerous, Spreading 772e
Disease in 1985, Among the
Living in 1987, State of
Euphoria in- ’88 and Persistence
of Time in ’90.

Anthrax’s brand of metal is
angry, ﬁerce, layered and LOUD,

complemented by socially-
conscious, in-your—face, blatantly
honest lyrics that hit where it hurts.
Ian and his mates have never been
accused of pulling any punches.
Anthrax is a high—powered metal
machine, supercharged with heavy
riffs and has a faithful legion of
followers moshin’ along with them.
Those who aren’t familiar with this
bunch may wonder about their
style on a tour with PE. Well, they
don’t fit any of the metal
stereotypes. Besides, Ian being
down with Chuck and Flav, racism
has been one of their prominent
targets over the years in songs
such as “Indians,” “Schism,” “One
World” and “H8Red.” They preach
about respect for others, love for

fellow man and the hatred that.

racism arouses in their minds. In
“Schism,” Belladonna sings
“prejudice is an unnatural thought/
it’s not inherited; it’s taught.” But

nowhere is the theme stronger

than on “Keep It In The Family.” “I
try to understand what the hell is
going on/ I can’t imagine how
things got so far gone/ you
separatists say you want your own
state,’ I’ll give them a state, a state
of unconsciousness.”

Primus is impossible to
categorize. The trio from San
Francisco blends progressive,
punk, thrash, funk and whatever
else they want into a sound that
can’t really be compared to
anything, save possibly the Red
Hot Chili Peppers.’ Their latest
record, Sailing the Seas of Cheese,

.is their third release. The 1990 LP,

Fizzle Fry, was one of Spin
magazine’s albums of the year.
Honestly, Primus is not for
everyone and requires a couple of
serious listenings before even
grasping their music.

Young Black Teenagers are five
white rappers from New York City
who developed their concept with
the help of the Bomb Squad’s
Hank Shocklee. In 1990 Shocklee
signed YBT to his newly created

label. The lyricists of the group are

Union Station moving Without over-sentimentali

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pitt senior Marta Efﬁnger’s well-
written Unz'onStationexplores the
power of the extended black
family to transcend the pain of
failure and crushed dreams. Kuntu
Theater premieres Effinger’s
American College Theater award-
winner. ‘

Union Station is moving
without verging into
sentimentality; Efﬁnger’s use of
language is simple and eloquent,
and most of the acting is excellent.

The play takes place in 1978 in
Washington, D.C. (Effinger’s
hometown) in the jointly shared
home of the Averys and the
Jacksons.

~ Rutherford Avery (Angelo Reid)
is a parking-lot attendant
absorbed in his dreams ofstarting
his own bakery.

The play opens with his family
busily mixing batter and icing
cakes.

His wife Cecilia (Andrida
McCall) is a talented sculptorwho

hasn’t been able to leave her.
government job and support!

herself through her artwork.

Their’ young daughter Chloe
(Vanessa Lynn Doss) is addicted
to the radio, and their son Booker
(Kerry Beckley) spends most of
his time reading autobiographies
of great black Americans like
Frederick Douglass.

The Averys live with Hamlin
Jackson (Bob Gore) and his
daughter Alberta [Linda Hunt].
Hamlin is proud of his dedication
to hisjob as a porter in Union
Station and gets in a few jam
sessions in his spare time with his
friend “Jellybean” Douglas
(Clifford Sykes).

Alberta leads a basicallyjoyless

life, lashing out with a well-placed
snarl from time to time while
silently struggling with the
deaths of her mother and her
husband. ‘

McCall and Hunt are strong
and passionate as the female
leads.

McCall’s soliloquy about her
frustrations in finding a purpose
to her life is especia1ly»moving.

Hunt effectively portrays the
pain barely masked by her
coldness.

The joint families’ problems
intensify when Rutherford drains
the family budget trying to make
his business work, and the Averys
despair of ever making enough
money to support their family in
comfort. Hamlin hurts himself at
work and worries about losing
his job.

Rutherford begins to spend less
and less time with his children,
and eventually Cil and Booker

enlist Vernon, a Howard
University student (a fine,
understated performance by
Conrad Cosey), to be Booker’s
“big brother” through a program
for fatherless boys. The families’
difficulties build to a conclusion
which is uplifting without being
contrived. .

Jean-Pierre Nutini’s light design
is subtly effective, especially the
spotlights used‘ during Hamlin’s
conversations with his dead wife
Alma.

The set, scattered with Cil’s
Africa—influenced artwork,
doesn’t work as well; at times it
was difficult to tell when an actor
wassupposed to be outside or
inside the house.

Vernell Lillie’s direction came -

apart at times when the pace of

. the show slowed but moved

toward a powerful ending.
Gore and Sykes turn in solid
performances as the nostalgic

DJ profile

  

 

By Ross Pasquale
Senior Staff Writer

Fresh from nearby Monroeville
comes the Ivory girl of WPTS, the
accommodating and fascinating
Laura LaFave. Her show on
Fridays is something ofa mix, but
that’s just indicative of her
willingness to help — by playing

anything anyone wants —~— and

her diverse interests.

Peer pressure brought self-
proclaimed conformist LaFave to
the station, where she holds the
position of continuity director.

“I was forced into it by my
peers,” LaFave said, recalling the
fateful day when a group of
unidentified “older students”
introduced the innocent, Red

Riding Hood-like_ Laura to the
big, bad, wolflike WPTS.
“They told me I’d be a lame-o

if I didn’tjoin,” LaFave said. Rather‘-

than suffer such horror, LaFave
conceded and has since become
a favorite of the ‘PTS crew,

oblivious to the power struggles .

and known as “kind of quiet” by
various staff members.

“Everything” is the word she
used to sum up what she likes
about being a D], noting Toad
the Wet Sprocket as one of her
favorite bands to play. She also
writes public—service announce-
ments for the station.

Her majors are mathematics
and philosophy, and she came to
Pitt to be an economics major,
until she found out that she didn’t

like the department very much.
LaFave attended Gateway High
School, where her good grades
and charm snagged her a
Chancellor’s scholarship here at
Pitt.

On the differences between
her two majors, LaFave said,” I
like the concrete side of math
and its applications through
economics. Then philosophyjust
seems to take it all, the underlying
logic of everything, away. It also
makes you think. You say to
yourself, ‘Why does this work?’
You begin to see the symbolic
logic of everyday life. I talk with
my hands a lot,” she motioned.

She does hope to go to graduate
school  someday.

“Long—term goals: I do want to
go to graduate school but maybe
not right away. Oxford has a
math/ philosophy program, but I
can’t see myself going to Oxford.
I don’t know. I’ve never been to
Australia; I’d like to go there.”

However her real goal is simply
to help anyone who needs it. She
was once a secretary in the math
department “just to help out. I
like to help people.”

For a dose of the refreshing
Laura, listen to 98.5 FM every
Friday from 2 to 4 p.m.

THE PIITINEWS, Thursday, September_26, 1991

 

 

Fat bag ofgreen

from Cypress Hill

Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill
Ruff House/ Columbia

Like most young Americans,
regardless of color, Cypress Hill
likes to “feel the effects of the
high.“ Now what they do and
what you do with “the high” are
probably different things. But
judging from this South Central
L.A. debut effort, The Hill likes to
groove, and groove they do,
throwing down thick-ass bass
lines over dense, dense sampling

‘that gives the record a drivin’,
serious, underground street feel.

The lyrics are as deep as the
beats and probably will gain
attention for their hard-core
gangsta verses on cuts like “Hand
On The Pu mp” and “Hole In The
Head.” C.H. even rallies on the
boys in blue. in “Pigs.” But don’t
discard C.H., as some two—bit,
N\X/A—wannabe group, jumping
on the shoot-to—thrill tip, this
record is heavier than NWA’s and
worthy of attention on beats
alone, something NWA knows
nothing about, except

counterfeiting ‘em.

B.Real and Sen Dog team up
with massive style to blast yer ass

‘back to reality. “People ask why I

do you sound so funny/ they
must be talking about my funky
nasal vocal money/ I take control,
no need to blow my nose/just
kick on the chumpy and feel the
funky ﬂow,” kicks the nasal-drop

wonder, B.Real, on “The Funky v

Cypress Hill Shit,” a serious
grinder on side two.

Sen Dog’s Latin—llavored tongue
combined with B. Real’s nasal

ﬂair comes out as ruthless and .

refreshing as the blunts they/
you/I smoke. On “How I Could
Just Kill A Man,” C.H. drops
science for all to consider:

“Say some punk tried to get
you for your auto/ watchal one
time gonna play the role model/
no, I think you’ll play like a thug/
next you hear the shot of a
magnum slug/ hummin’  comin’
at ya/ and you know I’m gonna
gatcha/ so how do you know
where I’m at, when you haven’t
been where I been?” Good point;
better beat.

The wax blasts off with the
nasty nursery rhyme, “Pigs,” and
sets the tone for the album’s
urban-jungle theme. The rest of
the first side is pure dope. “It’s
just another of those funky
Cypress Hill jams, you know what
I’m sayin’.”

“-Hand On The Pump” features
a sweet sample of “Duke Of Earl”

. as an intro, then moves with as
running sample and scratch of ‘V

“Cypress Hill.” “Light Another” is

just about that, smokin’ the I

buddha ty, which C.H. has a
deep affection for. It includes a
fresh-ass horn loop. The first
single, “The Phuncky Feel One”
is real phat.

Side two proves just as deep,
beginning with a bumpin’ low
bass in “Real Estate.”
“Psychobetabuckdown” contains
a host of '70s Parliament samples
to swing with, and “Something
ForThe Blunted” is about a minute

, and a half full of potent herbs, the

funkiest minute in hip-hop (with
the possible exception of Maseo’s
verse in‘ “Bitties in The BK.
Lounge”).

“Latin Lingo” pays homage to-
the roots with a real, heavy, dark
groove, complete with congas in
the background, while “Born To

Get Busy" describes to a tee what

this vinyl slaps.
Major props go out to the
production crew of DJ. Muggs

_ andjoe “The Butcher,” who serve

a most impressive debut. It is fair
to say that this crew has emerged
as a force to be reckoned with, as
far as underground, fat beats are
concerned.

While the production is kept to
a_ minimum for effect, it is vaguely
reminiscent of the Bomb Squad’s

style, with a lot of background .
- noise and patented siren/screams.

The hooks aren’t as crisp but
they’re power-packed and way

I in there.

Everything about tha wax is
top notch. Hard as hell, with a
dope team of MCs. It ain’t too
much to say this is the rap world’s
best LP 0’ tha year. Phat! -

Crepes and death with Les T

By M.C. Lingo
Staﬂ“ Writer

Sometimes if my expresso is a
little too strong, l’ll dump all that
blackness into a small bowl and
infect it with that dire white
substance that most smart tuffers
pass by in their dairy section.
That’s usually as francais as I can
deal.

Well, actually I have a friend
who smoked hash and drank

_ cheap wine in Lorraine, and I do

know a girl that allegedly can
stretch and bake a mean croissant

N ordan

Continued from page 5-6
while digging under his porch
with an army surplus entrenching
tool. We are never quite sure
whether it is real or just one of
Sugar’s flights of fancy. He goes
on a second honeymoon with his
parents to the Gulfcoast just after
it has been hit by a ferocious
hurricane, and its beaches are
littered with dead fish and animal
carcasses. He is present while his
father administers a lethal dose
of morphine to the local druggist
just after having saved him from
swallowing his tongue. His father
warns him, “The delta is filled up
with death,” and proceeds to
contribute his mite by occasional
suicide attempts: an icepick in
the sternum, a knife in the belly.

As in so much fiction based in
the American south, Nordan’s
book contains sordid characters.

' There are abusive fathers, slutty,

alcoholic mothers and fat, semi-
literate storekeepers. The town
of Arrow Catcher is small, poor
and populated by strange
characters” Children witness all
the vices and mistakes of the
adults without serious ill effects.
Nightlife consists of drinking and
dancing at the American Legion
Hut or watching Sammy Davisfon
the tube. Yet there is a particular
sweetness in Sugar’s child’s—eye
view of his world which relieves

,1 much of the sadness with laughter
and memories of closeness and A

love. ,

There is also a timelessness
about Music of tbe Swamp.
Several generations of a family
may live together, and the culture
of the grandparents often intrudes
on the culture of the children. Its
memories range from the Baptist
hymns still sung at public baptisms
to the songs of Elvis and Jimmy
Rodgers or from radio baseball to
afternoon cartoon shows. But its
main theme, the love and loss of
love and lack of love between a
father and son, is one of the most
timeless of all.

The poetic prose of Nordan’s
stories will enchant you; the
startling memories will haunt you.
More important, they will charm
you, enabling you to see the
beauty and nobility behind the
sordid behavior and squalid
conditions in Arrow Catcher.
Sugar’s incomprehensible love for
his father and stolid devotion to
his friends make Music of the
Swamp sing‘ to even the most

cynical listener. And since Nordan A

is a creative writing prof here at
Pitt, you can praise him in person
and get him to sign your copy.

dough. Yet is there more? Sorta. I
certainly don’t subscribe to that
“europas and their bands suckkit”
a1l—encompassing attitude of
Southern Americana. Hell, Mark
E. Smith and Crass made many a
teen year more bearable than I’da
thunk at the time. European
money does tend to be often-
wise when it comes to signing/
touring bands from our lovable
regime— Glitterhouse and
Resonance, sucking up okey—
dokey American bands to thrill
the Euromasses.

And within all this we get to the

point of the matter: Les Thugs.
Greatly more pleasing to these
ears than the dumb-numb-
dumbness of similar toadies as,
say, the Angry Samoans or Naked
Raygun.

Les Thugs brand of rock dates
back to Rocket to Russia—era
bugsbunniecore. Big, phat riffs
with big, quick beats. Singles on
Glitterhouse and Sub Pop, the
European release Dirty White
Race, late ’80s domestic releases
and now a new LP, I.A.B.F., on
Alternative Tentacles are among
these Frenchies’ recorded output.

Tesla
Psychotic Supper
Geffen

In this day and age of off—the—
wall kind of music, with
everybody and their brother trying
to do something new and
inventive, it’s good to find an
honest—to-goodness rock ‘n’ roll
band. I mean, innovation and
new ideas are good, but an honest
rock ‘n’ roll band is great to have
around.

Tesla has avoided the trap of
trying to sound like themselves
which other bands who have met
with success have done, i.e. Van
Halen from_ their Van Halen 11
until 1984.

Jeff Keith’s vocals are back in
full force. His Scratchy/throaty
sound is perfect for rock ‘n’ roll.
Frank Hannon and Tommy
Skeoch give their best guitar
performances to date. Brian
Wheat gives us just the right

amount of bass, and Troy
Luccketta really works the drums.

The_opening song, “Change In
The Weather” could be called
standard Tesla, but it has a touch
of difference about it that really
Sets up the album.

Tesla has some fun in the song
“Do De—Rock Me.” If given to
Metallica or some other metal
band, it would be a hard-core, in-
your—face thrash song, but these
guys play it at about 3/5 thrash
speed and volume for a nice
twist. It is really a standout song.

The guys have put a dedication
song onthe album to a guitarist
they respected. The Song is “Song
& Emotion,” and it is dedicated to

for   the newest Tesla

the late Steve Clark, who was a
guitarist for Def Leppard. At over
8 minutes long, it might turn
some people off, but it is a great

song. It has a nice Slow acoustic
opening, then they kick it in. The
only problem is that the guitars
sometimes overpower the vocals,
but the interesting musical end
makes up for that.

One of the" funniest/most
unusual tracks is a 58-second
ditty called “Government
Personnel.” lt’s an acoustic folk
song that sounds like something
Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs might
have written if they had gotten
together. 0

The ‘radio ballad’ song will
probably be “Stir It Up.” It has a
nice intro and is extremely well-
thou ght—out and played. Although
it is a good ballad, “What You

Give” is even better, but it is over

7 minutes long, so most stations

probably won’t play it.
Tesla has finally hit a home run

with a studio album. Mechanical '

Resonance and The Great Radio

album clears the fence. A definite
