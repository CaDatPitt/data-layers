News Presents
One-Act Drama
On Lytton Ave.

Reporters Investigate
Strange Case of Black
Coupe Near Campus

Immunity from enforcement
of the two-hour parking restric-
tion on Fifth avenue and Lytton
avenue is evidently a privilege
of Pittsburgh Athletic Associa-
tion membership.

That’s what a reporter and a.
photographer from the Pitt News
decided yesterday.

For not only were they witnesses
of a condoning of a parking viola-
tion by the PAA-paid police officer,
but the photographer was prohib-
ited from taking a picture of the
act.

It all happened yesterday morn-
ing when they noted from the win-
dow of the Pitt News office that a
black coupe, license number 463C8,
was parked in the wrong direction
(illegally by any law) and was jut-
ting out into Lytton avenue direct-
ly in front of the PAA.

Noticing that the PAA-paid of-
ﬁcer was not tagging the car, as
he has been tagging student cars
ever since the enforcement cam-
paign went into effect, the News
dispatched a reporter and a pho-
tographer to check the actions of
the police. They saw three office-rs
calmly watch the parked car with-
out tagging it. They watched until
the driver came out of the PAA
to remove the vehicle.

lvieanwhile the following action
took place: a lieutenant and a mo-
torcycle officer, rode up from the
station, reconnoitered along Lyt-
ton avenue, rode back and confer-
red with the PAA-paid officer.

The three men converged on the
News representatives:

Officer: What are you doin’ with
that Camera. 1

Photographer: Takin’ a picture.

Officer: Of what?

Photographer: (hesitantly)
these cars parked here.

Officer: For what?

Photographer: The Pitt News.

Officer: You better fold up that
camera and put it away. (Action
takes place) Better be careful,
you’ll have the FBI investigating
you. (This very sincerely) Does the
dean know about this?

Reporter: The dean hasn’t heard
about this affair. The News is
a strictly student business.

The driver of the illegally park-
ed but untagged car then came out
of the PAA and drove away. The
three officers watched, then left.

The reporter and photographer
returned to the Cathedral.

ROTC to Drill
At Ruskin Field

The ROTC will drill on Ruskin
Field Monday, announces Colonel J.

ed, according to Dr. John Weber,

‘secretary of the University, who

said owners. after he “had explain-
ed the situation,” decided to permit
the ROTC to use Ruskin Field for
drills until further notice.

The University was requested last
October to pay for the use of the
ﬁeld by the Schenley Farms. com-
pany because of the heavy tax bur-
den. Dr. Vi/'eber then told the
company ofﬁcials that the Univer-
sity was unable to pay for the use
of the area because all grants for
military appropriations had already
been made.

Sutherland Expresses Views
On Alumni-Administration Crisis

A new voice was heard in the
latest alumni-administration crisis
this week when Dr. John B. (Jock)
Sutherfand, former head football
coach, declared that he was “heart-
ily in accord” with the present pol-
icy of having the General Alumni
Association elect 15 “nominees” to
the University Board of Trustees.

The latest flare-up broke- across
the alumni-administration front
last Monday night when Chancellor
John G. Bowman submitted to a
closed meeting of the Alumni
Councilva proposal calling for the
nomination of 30 candidates by the
alumni,‘-‘ 15 of which to be actually
elected by the=~Board.

Speaking in Newark before a
joint’ meeting of the New York and
New Jersey alumni clubs, Dr. Suth-
erland denied «that he was a candi-
date for membership on the board.
“I have repeatedly been asked if I

Reviewer Praises ‘Dido and Aeneas’

By Denton Beal

On Tuesday night, Foster Memor-
ial was the scene of the ﬁrst of
three performances of Henry Pur-
cell’s “Dido and Aeneas,” the ﬁrst
opera ever to be given by the stu-
dents of the University, and the ﬁrst
presentation in Pittsburgh of this
greatest of all English operas.

The cast was for the most part
an admirable one, the pricipal solo-
ists exhibiting great talent and mu-
sicianship. Miriam Goldstein, as
Dido, Queen of Carthage, brought
to her part a superb voice and a re-
strained, sensitive interpretation of
her dramatic role. As beﬁts the
role of queen, she became the cen-
ter of each scene in which she ap-
peared.

Georgetta Davis, as the Sorceress,
played the most colorful part in the

opera with both dramatic force and
vocal ability. Her clear voice and
easily understood diction were of
great aid in clarifying to the audi-
ence the action of the entire opera.
Louise Margolis made a convinc-
ing Lady-in-VVaiting, and gave a
very pleasing performance.

The male roles in the work are
relatively less important. But Wil-
liam Schneider, singing the part of
Prince Aeneas, managed, in spite
of rather stiff acting, to create with-
out exaggeration a sense of perfect
sincerity and deep emotion by the
artistic use of a well-trained voice.

The only other solo part for male
voice is that of the Sailor, and was
sung by R.obert Bosler with a hearty
gusto that was received by the au-
dience with great pleasure.

The faults in the performance
were of a minor nature: the chorus

occasionally forgetting to watch the
conductor, causing, with one or two
false entrances on the part of some

of the minor characters, a momen-
tary confusion. Most of this can
be laid to “ﬁrst—night nerves.”

The settings by James Lindsay
provided a masterful background
for the singers. Chorus costumes
and movements were designed to
give balance of color to ﬁt the at-
mosphere of the scene, and the set-
tings were of the utmost simplicity
and effectiveness.

The witches’ cave with its dark
mystery and severe dances by girls
of WAA, and the rolicking scene on
the water-front in which members
of the football and basketball teams
received special applause for their
terpsichorean ability, were particu-
larly enjoyable.

am to be a candidate,” he said.
“My answer is no.

“I am certain that my name on
the ballot would be misleading and
might infer that this is an athletic
issue, whereas it is an issue of far
broader implications . . . However,

I am heartily in accord with the’.

principle of alumni selection of 50
per cent of the Board of Trustees
as agreed upon by the Common-
wealth and the University some
years ago,” Dr. Sutherland de-
clared.

While the alumni crisis was mov-
ing toward a head here this week,
Eugene Burkhart, ’36, alumni sec-
retary, was telling alumni groups
throughout - Pennsylvania, New
York, and. Virginia of the latest
wrangle. While on his tour Mr.
Burkhart continued to endorse the
arrangement by which h.alf of the
board is chosen by the University’s
organized alumni.

“We feel that this is the biggest
single step that we may take for
the assurance of continued pros-
perity for the University and for
the assurance of good common
sense administration of the Uni-
versity,” he said.

Debunking That
‘College Boy’ M yth

If the glamorous atmosphere of the University ‘s
new “Katliedral liitclieiiette” represents the ro-
mantic aspect of college life, We believe that a little
debunking of the niytli of the easy life of the aver-
age Tuck Shop Tonim_v is in order. Most Pitt stu-
dents should give a rousing second to this editorial
from the daily Dartinoutli, reported by Associated
Collegiate Press:

“lt’s about time soinebody tried once and for
all to dispel the myth of the carefree college boy.
The college boy, people who are out of college, or
have never been there, will tell you, lives a life
which runs the gamut from pu.re joy to the ul-
timate in rhapsodic existence, and the Sunday mag-
azine sections picture liiini with glass in hand, his
lips creased in a gay smile, while a number of beau-
tiful women parade past him like so much beef on
the hoof.

“The college boy may seem that way at times,
to prolong the life of this popular ﬁction, and
thousan.ds of young girls who stand on their feet
all day behind the counters from VVorcester to
Oshkosh ﬁnd their own particular heaven in watch-
ing some clean cut god of the Tom Brown species
cavort through a land overﬂowing with evening
clothes and eXciti.ng football ﬁnishes, strewing his
fraternity pins behind him. _

“The college boy may seem that way at tune,
and particularly when he begins to reminisce for
the beneﬁt of the liomefolks during vacation peri-
ods, but that is because he is learning that the only
way‘ to please is to give people what‘ they expect,
and that no one will believe, much less listen to
him, if he tries to tell the crowd that he is doing a
serious job of going to college, and that he has a
lot’ of things on his mind.

“Tliie fact is that college boys work hard. take
a Saturday night off for relaxation, like to sit by
the ﬁre and read the newspaper, are ugly or good
looking as the case may be, have their domestic
troubles with their roommates, get broke, argue
with the trafﬁc cop, do or do n.ot like their eggs
ﬂopped over, and call Mr. Roosevelt names, even
as any average citizen who lives uphill and goes
to work on Main Street.

‘..‘Just the same, We hope the day will come
when some stranger will tell us that he’s working
in such and such a place. and we can reply that
We’re going to college, without catching that ‘oh,
college boy’ look in his eye.”

The Bawdy Politic
By S. F. Ayers I ~

One week from today, the University campus will be
littered with handbills, lollypops, and little colorec “slate
cards” as Pitt students go through the colorful side-
show business of the spring election.

Before we got too excited about this political busi-
ness, we decided to analyze Pitt’s student government
to see just what this shouting is all about. Here’s what
we found on Pitt’s most important student govern-
ment organization, Student-Faculty Association:

SF.A includes representatives of all of the under-
graduate schools on the University campus, plus the
School of Dentistry, and some faculty and administra-
tion members. The SFA Assembly has 30 student and
10 faculty members. Students will be elected next Fri-
day at Memorial Hall. Faculty members are appointed
by the Chancellor. I

SFA's Powers

SFA’s powers include, technically, anything not re-
served to the faculty by the Board of Trustees. Actu-
ally, SFA does nothing without administration sanc-
tion, either direct or implied.

The presence of the deans in the assembly gives
the administration viewpoint plenty of opportunity to
be represented. Faculty members, other than admin-
istrators, are usually uninterested; some faculty mem-
bers seldom bother to attend meetings.

Concretely, here’s what SFA sponsors: ﬁve large
"University dances, Spring Festival week, a football
banquet, free student movies, concert hours, several
football pep assemblies, a scholarship assembly, an
activities award assembly, and the Stadium. football
demonstration block. '

Committees for SFA have investigated building and
-grounds improvements and parking and trafﬁc prob-
lems in recent years. The SFA social committee acts
as "a clearing house for all student social affairs and
adrninisters a set of social rules which are largely the
work of the deans’ ofﬁces. I

How They're Managed

Officers or special committees of SFA request state-
ments of University policy from the administration at
the request of the assembly. The last important in-
vestigation of this type, which was no investigation at
all.—-merely an interview with the business manager of
the iUniversity—was conducted by a committee which
obtained indeﬁnite statements on athletics, building
program, and publications.

To ﬁnd out just h.ow student activities are managed,
we. talked to the student leaders who ﬁll the “big jobs”
on campus.

The University administration, we were told, does
not openly manage any student activity affair; however,
it gets all the supervision it seems to want by having
faculty members judiciously placed on SFA committees
and by practically requiring students who manage any-
thing from an assembly to a tea dance to see an admin-
istrative oﬁicer for social registration, or for the ne-
cessary appropriation.

llio Old Roman Game

Much of the weakness of Pitt student government is
caused by the way in which the activity budget is run.
Activities funds are apportioned by the University’s
business manager through the deans of men and women,
and faculty advisers of other organizations.

No government group gets more money than will
pay for its usual quota of assemblies, banquets for the
members, and perhaps a few keys for the officers.

Student-Faculty Association has absolutely no con-
trol ovcr its own budget or over the budgets of the
individual student activities. The size of student ac-
tivity budgets depends on how important the Univer-
sity administration wants these student activities to
be. In student government, as in anything else, “no

The Pitt News

Drivel - -

By Robert Hamilton

We are not one to criticize Lellow-columnists, but
our colleagues of Weak Tea and Common Sense colla-
borated last issue in striking a note which seems to be
the main theme of a song too many people are singing
nowadays. Its popularity is really strange, for it is
out of tune.

This note is, one of pessimism and discouragement,
which is, to use the slang phrase, a helluva note for
Americans to be singing‘. In one paragraph Kal claims
that the government is still run by the middle class,
meaning, by and large, you and me, and then a little
farther on he blows off about fate against youth, etc.
ad nauseam.

'Pouring It Out’

Of course, no one takes the Senator seriously, but
judging by what happened to Bill McElwain quite a
few people do believe in Kal’s writings, so we felt we
ought spend a little more time on it rather than pour-
ing it out to meet a deadline.

What the youth of today needs is a little more cour-
age; and determination, not to mention pT'i'i”LCipleS. Too
many kids today recognize they're afraid, assume that
they are cowards, and give themselves over to fear.

Now we happen to be something of an authority on
fear, and probably no one in the school has been scared
oftener or more completely than we have. So it is
with the voice of experience that we can say that cour-
age consists not of a lack of fear, but of controlling fear.
The guy who wrote “Better a live coward than a dead
hero” utilized some of the most decadent thinking we’ve
encountered. Which brings up another problem, viz.,
pri.ncip1es.

A Peaceful Guy

Now take us, we’re a peaceful guy, and don’t get
any great enjoyment out of strife. You leave us alone
and there’s never a ﬁght in a carload. But, we adhere
to certain principles, and if we are provoked beyond a
certain point we are willing to kill or die for those prin-
ciples. So far we haven’t died. Personally, we prefer the
killing viewpoint as being a lot more virile and active
than a passive willingness to die. Dying for a cause
never did it half so much good as killing for it, which is
the same thing as saying living for it.

Take war, as every other columnist does. We’re a
paciﬁst to a certain point. If we don’t think the war’s
the right thing, no one’s going to make us go. At pres-
ent, our principles are outraged to the point where wc’d
just as soon go to war against England. as Germany,
and teach the meddling Britishers to keep hands off
U. S. mail.

Register a Protest

However, we may in time come around to pulling
for U. S. aid to the Scandinavian coontries. We’re not
going to be stampeded by any fool propaganda though,
or fear of this, that and the two green things in the
corner, but if we go to war we’re going to register a
violent protest while we last, or as long as the oppos-
ing army holds out. We think the latter is more
probable.

We could go on for a volume or two more, but we
won’t. However, we do think it high time that Amer-
icans once again assumed the following motto, which
ought to be framed and hung in every home, “Say ‘May
I’ to the weak, and ‘I will’ to the strougf”

From an administrative standpoint, the whole busi-

power or money; so student government can’t cause
trouble.

It’s a perfect illustration of the old Roman game of
“divide and rule.”

The Spectator
Speculalos

Editor, the Pitt News:

This is to announce the return
of the Spectator. lVIy ﬁrst subject
is a certain article by “Senator Zis-
kind” in Wednesday’s News.

Senator, if you were to be walk-
ing down the street and came upon
a couple of college gladitators, strip-
ped to the waist and pummeling
each other viciously, and you hap-
pened to know both of them--what
would you do? If you show as
much “Common Sense” as you
would like us to believe, you would
keep your nose clean and settle
down to watch the fun at a safe dis-
tance without attempting to enter
the squabble.

As countries are not merely vague
soulless corporations, as we are apt
to think at times,‘ but strips of land
given individually by the people
who inhabit them, we might well
liken warring countries to ﬁghting
college boys. (A rather homely
comparison, Senator, but I want you
to be sure and understand what I
am talking‘ about.)

Did you ever stop to think that
Great Britain became a world pow-
er by the same tactics that Hitler is
applying today?

Do you remember a certain Amer-
ican revolution against the tyranny
of the English‘?

And now, a hundred years later,
Germany is doing the same sort of
thing. Senator, surely with your
knowledge of economics you do not
believe that Great Britain declared
war on Germany in the interest of
democracy? I am quite sure that
even you will agree that this is a
battle for economic control; a con-

trol that Britain has exercised in

the past, through the same kind of
tyranny that Germany is attempt-
ing now.

In the cause of money versus hu-

manity, I am peculiarly inclined to
favor humanity, believing that
money was invented as a medium
of exchange and not as a god to
which man might be sacrificed.

In brief, senator, it is my humble
opinion that the United States might
best serve herself and her sons and
daughters if she showedva vicious
disregard for the suffering that Eu-
rope has brought upon itself. and
concentrated on the minor home

"problems. such as unemployment.

And if the United States takes it
upon herself to lend even economic
aid. to the allies, it is my treasonable
opinion that she will do so in the in-

As sure as we start sending war
supplies to the Allies, one of our
ships will be sunk, and the loyal
American pub1ic—-such that it is,
will forget the countless Veteran
hospitals in the country-—and de-
clare war on a nation who means
only to protect itself against outside
aid to the country with which it is
struggling.

As a parting thought, let me quote
something I overheard in the Tuck

“I’ll ﬁght like hell for a woman

Nominee Opposes
SFA Nomination

Editor, the Pitt News:

As one poor, innocent, student by-
stander, I am thoroughly disap-
pointed with the practices used by
our esteemed SFA executive com-
mittee in appointing, without ask-
ing permission, certain of my broth-
er students, as well as myself, to po-
sitions on the ballots in the forth,-
coming elections. This was done to
pad the ballots to have enough
names on them.

Without any Knowledge before-
hand, we have been placed on the
ballots with no possible chance of
placing in the elections.
are we on the spot, but why should
we draw votes away from our
friends whom we wish to support.

It appears that ten fraternity men
and two independents were nomin-
ated. Something stinks! ! Social
justice has been total.1y lacking in
this smelly affair. I hope something
will be done about it.

Pitt Nine Gets
Season’s First

Outdoor Drills

Mitterling Transfers

F oliart to Shortstop
As Part of Shakeup

Pitt’s faltering baseball team went
through its most intensive outdoor
drill of the season Wednesday after-
noon as coach Ralph Mitterling
sought to correct the numerous
faults that plagued the Panthers on
their Southern trip.

Prior to the Wednesday workout,
bad weather kept forcing the Pitt
nine to hold almost all its practices
indoors. The “quarantine” drills
showed their effects in the gloomy
performances of the Panthers on
their recent Southern invasion.
Coach Stressese Defense

Coach Mitterling stressed defense
in both the outﬁeld and inﬁeld drills.
Both departments were extremely
weak and unorganized in the four
defeats charged against the Panth-
ers.

Mitterling’s ﬁrst move to bolster
the wobbly inﬁeld came when he
shifted third baseman Bob Foliart
over to shoststop. The new third-
sacker has not yet been determined.

Leading candidates for Foliart’s
vacated position were footballer
Ernie Bonelli, Snuify Hughes, and
Larry Katz. The latter has shown
considerable improvement and
should be a serious threat for the
job, according to Mitterling.

Another weak spotin the Panther
baseball armor is ﬁrst base. Here
the battle rests between Lefty,Drob-
nuski and catcher-ﬁrst baseman
Guy Guadagnino.

Cager To Help At First Base

The Pitt coach is not altogether
down.cast at the ﬁrst base difﬁculty
since basket baller Lefty Ziolkow'-
ski will probably report for base-
ball latzerlin the season.» Scholastic

troubles‘ reportedly are preventing"

Ziolkowski from donning a uniform
at the present.

Edgar Jones and Ernie Bonelli,
backﬁeld stars of the varsity foot-
ball squad are dividing their time
between baseball and spring grid
practice.

Perhaps the only note of optimism
in the Pitt baseball camp is that the

catching cho-res had been admira-”

bly handled on the Southern tour.
“Gabby” Hartman came through
both in the ﬁeldand at the plate
and appears to have the catching
situation well in hand.

Trackers Open Outdoor Season

Olson’s Cindermen
Compete in Spring
Handicap Contests

By Ben Foote
Coach Carl Olson brings his
squad of track and ﬁeld men down
to the Pitt Stadium for their initial

appearance on the outdoor lanes in
the annual Spring Handicaps tomor-
row afternoon.

This event pits varsity and fresh-
men spike-wearers in opposition to
each other, marking the only com-
petition of the campaign where up-
perclass men and ﬁrst year men
meet. Although this test always
springs surprises on account of the
large handicaps accorded some dark
horses, the scratch men usually
dominate the score sheet.

Stars Start From Scratch’

Naturally, the cinder aggrega-
tion’s top-notch performers must
take the back seat for the start of
the afternoon. Heading the list of
scratch performers, Happy Harold
Stickel and Bullet Bill Carter must
dig their holes a yard behind their
nearest adversary in the 100-yard
dash. With these-sensational soph-
omore sprint twins battling the full
century together, this duel should
produce the feature race of the aft-
ernoon.

Veteran Frank Ohl, the Pitt out-
ﬁt’s most heralded thinclad, gives
his mates anvadvantage in both the
220 and 440.

Ohl A National Standout

There is ample reason, for Ohl
recently received a post on the 1939
National Collegiate honor roll for
his feats in the 220 last season, and
he essayed the leadoff duties (he
handed his usual ten-yard lead to

Parks Declares College Men

Display Little lnterest in Golf

College boys don’t play enough
golf!

So declared Sam Parks, Jr., for-
mer Pitt captain and National Open
champ, who is currently presenting
a series of free lessons to faculty
and students.

Parks feels that college boys
should become interested in golf be-
cause it is the game they will play
as long as they’re young enough to
swing their arms—long after they
have given up baseball and football.

The ﬁrst four lessons which he
has given have instructed his pupils
on how to drive, a ball. They start-
ed with the grip, advanced to the
address, then to the backswing, and
ﬁnally to the downswing and fol-
low-through.

Today at 4 o’clock he will begin
lessons on how to use an iron and
next week the remaining clubs will
be dealt with.

Parks believes that a course of

golf such as he is presenting is in-
valuable to the beginning golfer as
well as to the one who has had
golfing experience.

The course teaches short cuts to
golfing proﬁciency which have been
developed by the leading golfers of
all time and which would take
years of the trial and error method
to perfect. Parks himself took les-
sons from Gene Sarazen before he
ever played a round of golf.

He doesn’t expect to produce any
champions in this short period of
instruction but he does feel that the
boys who are availing themselves
oil‘ this opportunity will ﬁnd them-
selves better golfers on the course
this season. -

This season holds many opportun-
ities for Parks. He hopes to do a
come back in the National Open to
prove that his ﬁrst championship
in 1935 wasn’t beginner’s luck. In
addition, he plans to enter numer-
ous other tournaments in the East.

Mushball Rivalry in Spring Intramural
League Reaches ‘White Heat’ Stage Today

Mushball holds the key spot on
this week-end’s intramural sports
program as the title hopes of the

fraternity teams get early-season’s
tests.

Today at 5 o’clock the intramur-
al champion, Sigma Alpha Mu, open
defense of its crown. The Sammies
are slated to tangle with the hard-
hitting Delta Tau Delta team on
Field 1. Lou Mendlow, SAM’s
“one-man team,” will be throwing
the strikes against such hitters as
“Bing” Benghouser, Emil Narick,
varsity gridders, and Crunkleton,
Jones, and Young.

Last year’s second place Phi Delt
squad is pitted against the Theta
Chi team at 3 o’clock. The Phi
Delts, a strong offensive ball club,
will be favored, for Theta Chi will
be without the services of stars Lar-
Iy Peace and Bill Daddio and must

pin their hopes on Murphy, Jones,
and Fitchko.

Kappa Sigma and Phi Epsilon Pi
will do battle today at 3 o’clock on
Field 2. The Phi Ep’s brilliant
showing of last season gives them
an edge but the Kappa Sigs have
Kish, Kracum, Bonavita and several
other vterans on deck.

The top clash tomorrow will be
waged by the SAM nine and the
ﬁghting Phi Delt team.

Another strong contender, Phi Ep-
silon Pi, may meet an obstacle in
Jay Silverberg, veteran
Phi Ep, and Murphy, returning reg-
ular of the Theta Chis, will be the
probable pitchers.

Pi Lambda Phi makes the ﬁrst
start of the 1940 season tomorrow
at 2 o’clock against Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. Bert Jaffe, all-fraternity
pitcher last season, and Hilliard

Kreimer, are the Pi Lam mainstays.

Blitzkreig Commentary

Lunden Reviews War Situation

“Germay has opened up . . .
but the Allies will gain in the end.”
Thus Dr. Walter A. Lunden re-
viewed the invasion of Denmark
and Norway by the German legions
this week. Dr. Lunden, assistant
professor of sociology, spent his fall
leave of absence in Germany, Nor-
way, Denmark, and Sweden and
saw the countries preparing for war
there.
Germany, he believes, will have a
big problem on its hand to fortify
unfortiﬁed Norway. Although for-

tiﬁcations were started when he was
still in Norway, the extent of the
protection was not enough to cover
the entire country. As th-e result,
the Germans will h.ave to ship goods
to Norway to protect it, Dr. Lunden
explained.

With Iceland and the Faroe is-
lands in its possession, Germany
will now have three important ad-
ditional sea bases from which to
attack England, he said.

Primarily, however, the taking
over of the Scandanavian country

Nominees Protest SFA
Group’s Election Lists

Students Resent Executive Committee Move
Of Placing Unpetitioned Candidates on Ballots

Announcement by the SFA executive committee of the 60 names to
appear on the voting machines in next Friday’s elections brought protests
from several nominees who were added to the lists by the committee.

Objections to having their names placed on the machines without their
permission or knowledge were voiced by the unwilling candidates on

several points.

Zane Donaldson, BA42, stated:
“Not only are we on the spot, but
we are drawing votes away from
our friends whom we wish to sup-
port.”

A number of the men selected by
the executive committee sought to
have their names removed from the
machines, but their protests were
in vain. It was explained that their
names’ were on the machines and
nothing could be done about it.

Another of the “candidates who
are not candidates,” Irving Kauf—-
man, C41, claimed that it is unfair
to pad the lists merely because
enough people did not I petition for
SFA. “This forced participation is
bad enough. But worse is the fact
that we”‘ﬁll-in’ students have no
chance of winning or of even mak-
ing a respectable showing.”

Tom Westermann, BA42, declar-
ed: “If I wanted to be a candidate,
I would have petitioned for the
post. I am supporting the candi-
dates of the campus political party
to which I belong.”

Ralph Detwiler, E42, and Robert
Quick,’ E42, expressed unwilling-
ness at being considered candidates
for SFA.  Said Detwiler: “I appre-
ciate the honor conferred upon me
by being nominated for the posi-
tion, but _I have outside work which
makes "it impossible for me to ﬁnd
the time.”

Quick declared that his activities
in his fraternity and on campus take
up the majority of his time so he
is unable to be a candidate.

HERE THEY COME in a hurricane of ﬂying
dirt and squirting oil. You can almost hear the
high whine of the motors and the shriek of
brakes and burning tires as they streak into the
sharp unbanked ‘curves. They may call ’em
"midget racers,” but there’s speed to burn under-
neath those toy-like hoods. Leading the pack

$Iower- Burning Camels GiVe the Extras

WITH BOB SWANSON, it's always a slow-burning Camel.
"That slower burning makes a big difference,” says Bob. “Camels
are milder-—easier on my throat. They don’t bother my nerves.
And they never tire my taste. They give an extra amount of
smoking, too.” Yes, speed is fine in the right place, but millions
have learned that in cigarettes the coveted extras of coolness,
mildness, and full, rich ﬂavor go with slouv-burning Camels.

likes a slower pace in his off-time. Fishes a lot.
Smokes Camels a lot. He explains: "I don’t like
overheating in my cigarette any more than I like
it in a racing motor. I stick to Camels. I know
they’re slower-burning . . . milder and cooler.”

In recent laboratory tests,
Camels burned 25% slower
than the average of the 15
other of the largest-selling
brands tested—-slower than
any of them. That’ means,
