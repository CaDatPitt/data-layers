UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

. Posvar’s
freeze

unpopular
with FAS

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

There may be new hope for
Pitt faculty members upset by the
university hiring freeze
announced last week, according
to Oxanna Kaufman, secretary of

- faculty assembly.

“lLate last] Wednesday we were
in a strategic planning sub
committee meeting. [Vice

President for Administration] John ‘

Yeager and [University Provost]
Don ’ Henderson both were
. present. Yeager said off the record
that it seems that there was
something mistranslated between
the time that [he] crafted the
lpresident’s update memo on the
hiring freeze] memo and the time
it got out,” she said yesterday
during. the faculty assembly
meeting in Forbes Quadrangle.

Kaufman offered this
information after several faculty
mernbersiioiced their anger over
the time and money spent on
recruitment efforts to fill positions
that would no longer be open in
accordance with the freeze policy.

According to Kaufman,
Henderson stated that recruitment
efforts that are currently underway
and had been approved by the
appropriate Dean would be
continued and honored. She said
that this is directly contrary to the
president’s memo.

Carolyn Redmond ,vice
president of the University Senate
Council, began the meeting with
a statement from James Mauch,
University Senate president, who
could not attend.

“We the officers believe that it
is a prudent response to the
financial uncertainties. It is also a
way to stop growth for a bit until
the strategic planning effort yields
more information on the most
critical areas for growth," said
Redmond.

When Redmond finished her
statement, hands in the assembly
shot up.

“I myself am uncomfortable
with the view that this is seen as
a prudent act. I want to go on
record as chairman of the
department that I have already
expressed my concerns with this
hiring freeze,” said Dennis Brutus,
chairman of the Black
StudiesDepartment.

Monday, the department
Chairpersons of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences met with Pitt
President Wesley Posvar and cast

Gays and lesbians fight campus bamssment .

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

As Mark Smith pins a ﬂier to a
bulletin board in the Towers.
Lobby at 12:50 p.m., most of the
horde of students rushing by don’t
notice. However, three boys
sitting nearby look at each other
after reading the ﬂier and begin
to laugh.

Smith continues to pin the
notices throughout the lobby and
then moves to the bridge over
Forbes Avenue. A girl walks by
staring at the ﬂiers and then
quickly looks away. Another girl
looks, stops and looks again, and
then continues, shaking her head.

The tape Smith is using is
making a cracking sound that
breaks the silence on the bridge.

A man walks by and stares at
Smith as if he were from another
planet. Two more male students
break into loud laughter as they
pass Smith. Several of the passers—
by look at the posters and wince
as if looking at a dead animal
close- up.

Smith then returns to the
Towers Lobby to assess the
damage. One of the posters near
the ﬁrst three boys has already
been torn down. Smith turns to a
girl who is sitting at a table,
selling T—shirts for her sorority,
and he asks her if she saw anyone
tear down the poster. She says
no, and Smith puts up another
ﬂier before he leaves. The girl
turns to the three boys behind
her. They laugh as one of the
boys tears down the second ﬂier.

‘Bisexual
, Alliance. “I heard one of [the

“This doesn't surprise me,” says
Smith, co—president of the
Gay and Lesbian

three boys] say ‘faggot’ when I
put the first one up. I could have
a staff working 40 hours a week
just to keep our ﬂiers up."
According to Smith, some of
the most common forms of
harassment of Pitt’s homosexual
community include tearing down
ﬂiers, sending hate mail, and
making snide remarks. Three
weeks ago, Smith caught a group
of Allderdice high—school students
vandalizing the BiGALA desk in
the William Pitt Union. Smith
chased them and called the
campus police, but the vandals
have not been caught.
‘'1 don’t report everything that

happens, because if I did, I would
not be able to function at this
university,” Smith says. “I'd just
be filling out reports. No one has
ever said anything to my face, but
these other things happen. The
greater our visibility, the greater
the harassment. Prejudice is very
weird.”

Some other members of the
organization have been verbally
harassed as well. Last September,
Donald Ainslie, a Pitt graduate
student, was followed as he put
up ﬂiers. '

“I was putting up signs in the
Towers lobby, and these two
kids started following me,” Ainslie
says. “One of them said to me
‘That’s really sick!’ I left and
walked toward Fifth Avenue.

Pitt group to aid Guatemala orphanage

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

While most people will be
celebrating the end of classes in
late April, a group of Pitt students
and faculty will be heading for a
working project in Central
America.

On April 29, 12 people will
head for Guatemala to make
repairs on an orphanage. The
group, known as the Agua Viva
Project, will spend nine days in
the Latin American country.

George Nixon, a disc jockey at
WPTS, is co—directing the mission.

“The main thing that we will be
doing down there is painting the
walls of the orphanage, both
inside and outside,” Nixon said.

World Opportunities, a
religious group based in the
United States, runs the orphanage
and a school for the kids and will
be helping the group. Nixon said
that the organization buys food
from food banks in the United
States and then sends‘ it down to
the kids. “Along with teaching
the kids,” he said, “they also
desire to teach the children part
of our culture." ,

One of the major problems that
this mission faces is lack of funds.
Cindy Fish, the other co-director
for the trip, said that they are
attempting to get money from
both corporate and private
sponsors to cover some of the
costs.

“We need about $14,000 per

person to pay for the trip,” he
said. “Among this will be $100 for
each person which is needed for
entry into the country. Strange as
it is, the Guatemalan government
requires it. “Alongwith that,
most of the money will go to
buying supplies like food, clothing
and books," Nixon said. He also
said that many of the books will
be in English. “World
Opportunities feels that the
children should learn English
because it’s such an important
language,” he said.

Nixon talked about one of the
infants in the orphanage. “A
newborn girl was born to a
Guatemalan prostitute," he said.
“Soon after the baby was born,
the mother attempted to slash its

throat in the middle of a
marketplace. A crowd stopped
her before the baby was hurt. Six
months later, the baby was
declared a ward of the court and
given to the orphanage.”

But Nixon said that the trip
won't be all work. “We will be
playing with the kids as much as
possible when we are done
working," he said. “We will have
crafts for them, and we will be
playing some games. And near
the end of the trip, we hope to
venture north to visit some ancient
Mayan ruins for a day.”

He also noted some of the
problems they will have. “There
are language barriers to worry
about," Nixon said. “Many of the

a unanimous vote of no-

confidence, saying the freeze had
halted their recruitment plans to
hire top—notch faculty. In
response, Posvar held a meeting
yesterday to explain his decision.

English Professor Philip Wion,

president of the United Faculty,
said that Monday's events did not
surprise him.

“First of all I [do not think] that
the chairpersons of FAS took [the
vote] lightly. I think that they
need to be taken seriously. I
think that they have found it

impossible to do their jobs,” he
said.

Wion said that their actions
were not solely based on the
problems with the hiring freeze.

“I think that this hiring increase
is not the only consideration in

BiGALA
Continued from page 1
They followed me out, yelling

‘faggot.”’

Ainslie went to Pitt’S Affirmative
Action Office to ﬁle a report.
“They were somewhat helpful,
but they didn’t have anyone
specializing in gay and lesbian
harassment,” he says. “That’s a
shame, because they should.”
Ainslie was told to keep filing
reports so that Affirmative Action
could keep track of the
harassment. 0

However, Ainslie is not
impressed. “The university is quite
passive. I think that the university
has to take responsibility for these
things.” Ainslie points to Rutgers
University, which is in the process
of starting an Office for Gay and
Lesbian Concerns.

“I think Pitt should take action
like that,” he says. “More positive
action should be taken so that
things don’t happen.”

According to Smith, the main
problem is that there is not enough
communication between the Pitt
administration and BiGALA. He
says he is upset that the university
hasn’t reached out to him, but he
adds that he is willing to take the
first, second or however many
steps it takes to make contact.

Last week, Smith met with Joe

Cavalla, director of student
activities, to discuss his concerns.
Cavalla told him to come back
with something in writing so that
he could take it to the vice
president of student affairs.
Monday, he gave his report to
Cavalla, who did meet with acting
Vice President for Student Affairs
Dennis Donham about the
problem.

According to Cavalla, these
issues may be discussed at the
Student Affairs Advisory
Committee meeting next week.
SAAC meetings are held so that
Pitt President Wesley Posvar can
meet with the leaders of student
groups.

Cavalla insists that his meeting
with Smith is just the first step in
creating a dialogue.

“What we need to do is uncover
the things that Mark [Smith] said
are being done,” he said. “We
have to create an awareness that
we do have a gay population,
and it isn’t going to be easy.”

“I have no problem with talking
to them,” he said, “They are a
group of students here, and no
one should be taking potshots at
them.” .

Smith has also said that the
SGB, especially the allocations
committee, has been helpful.

“The allocations committee has
done as much as it can [for
BiGALAl,” he says. “They have
allocated money for special ads
for our group.”

According to Gil Borok,
allocations chairman, “The
allocations committee does not
discriminate on the grounds of
race, sex, sexual orientation or
any other orientation, and I try to
offer all groups equal service.
Therefore, I treat BiGALA with
the respect I would give any
other group.”

However, other problems
remain. Many gay and lesbian
students who are dormitory
residents live in constant fear.

“I felt very uncomfortable in
the ILitchﬂeldI T owers,” saysjason
Weaver, a freshman who moved
out of the residence halls after
two months. “No one on my
floor ever said anything to me,
but people started giving me
weird looks. I hated living there

Once, Weaver was on an
elevator with some friends. As
they got off on his ﬂoor, they
heard some girls on the elevator
say “queers.” Another time, he
found “Fag” written on the pad
on the door of his room.

Weaver decided to move out
of the dorms for his own safety,
but found that it was difficult to
break his housing contract.

“I told a woman in the Housing , ‘

Office, ‘I’m gay, and it’s scary

living in the TowerS,”’ he says. '

“She didn’t seem convinced until
I told her I couldn’t pay my bill.
It’s expensive, but I could have
paid it, though it would have
been tight. It was a second reason
for me.”

Weaver says he feels that the
housing forms should have sexual
orientation on housing contracts,
so that gays and lesbianswill not
be forced to live in hostile
environments.

Hiring freeze sends chills

Pitt President Wesley Posvar has announced that the university
is suspending employee hiring and replacements, thus indicating
Pitt’s first hiring freeze since 1975.

University Executive Vice President Jack Freeman noted that
the President was concerned that the summer state appropriation
for Pitt may not sufﬁce the university's ﬁnancial needs. A low
ceiling on a university tax hike, along with the speculated low
appropriation, could result in a deﬁcit as high as $12 million.

Cutting the deﬁcit through a hiring freeze is a more attractive
alternative than slicing crucial funds from developmental or
technological programs within the university. Freeman stated

that the hiring freeze was the most practical way for the university

to hold back spending. He pointedly argues that nearly 80
percent of the budget “is in people,” and that the hiring suspen-

. sion “is the best way to adjust right now.” We should also keep

in mind that the university could always get the needed money
to fix the deficit by booming next year’s tuition; an alternative that
never goes over too well with students and parents.

At first glance the hiring freeze may sound a bit severe, and
even an odd way to remedy the school’s budget deﬁcit. It is.
Despite the fact that a large deﬁcit requires prudent action,
completely eliminating hiring for the next year is too large a
measure.

The university employed a total of 9,373 people in the fall
semester of 1988, the last available ﬁgure. Pitt is the largest
employer in the city of Pittsburgh, annually hiring roughly 300
faculty and 1,500 staff members. Salaries for faculty range from
$36,100 to $61,200. Multiply the median salary by the 300 faculty
members and you get nearly $15 million. ’Ihat’s almost $3 million
more than the university believes it will need to eliminate the
deficit. Tag on the 1,500 staff salaries and Pitt has saved itself quite
a bit of money, certainly more than necessary. Other large
employers cut back on hiring when faced with the same type of
problem. A university is no different. A 9

This fact has to be obvious to the university administration,
including the budget committee, the president, vice president
and members of every board. So why is Pitt instituting this
unfavorable procedure? Money and necessity. Any student who
has been here for more than a year knows that the university will
get funds wherever and whenever it can, be it from Governor
Casey's Challenge Grant or the soon-to-be $110 “computer fee.”
If it means not employing competent people, so be it.

But even that is covered under the freeze.‘ Posvar said that
exceptions to the policy would be made “under extraordinary
circumstances,” such as, Freeman said, “That might relate to the
opportunity to hire a world—class scholar or the situation where
you can demonstrate that leaving the position open will cost the
university more than hiring someone would.” As always, Pitthas
all the angles covered.

On February 5, Posvar received a vote of no-conﬁdence on his
hiring freeze from the chairmen and program directors of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. One chairman said that the freeze
was “the straw that broke the camel’s back.” Being that the
numbers prove that some hiring cuts would reduce the deﬁcit,
and that current professors won’t lose a penny of their paychecks,

there is really no explanation for their opposing the freeze, other 

than perhaps personal animosities towards Posvar.

Every now and then a striving university must stop to fill the
potholes. Only in this way can Pitt continue to drive along its road
to a prosperous and competitive future. It seems that the
university brain trust, however, doesn’t want Posvar driving.

Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland

"Cover me. ” —- Bruce Springsteen

"Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. ”

I was touched by a snowﬂake for
the very ﬁrst time three months ago.
Having spent all of my life in sub-
tropical Miami,.the notion of a bliz-
zard always seemed absolutely dread-
ful. Even the thought of a light snow-
fall made me appreciate the virtually
year-long summer that I had come to
take for granted. My aversion to
snow was reinforced every winter, as
thousands of “fortunate” northerners
ﬂocked to South Florida to escape
nature’s wrath.

Having grown acclimated to the

' Pennsylvania winter I now face every
day, I ﬁnd that nature has delegated
my attitudes toward the northern
climate to a most enlightening proc-
ess of cognition. Now I ﬁnd it diffi-
cult to imagine why anyone would
migrate south in order to pass up
nature’s spectacular show.

While being in the midst of a heavy
snowfall isn't always the easiest
experience (although it is rather
amusing to observe a street ﬁlled
with people who appear as though
they have giant dandruff pellets in
their coifs), the results are incompa-
rable. There’s nothing quite like a
fresh snow cover. It is soothing, and
may very well be the most comfort-
ing of all nature’s decorations.

Stephen Holden, discussing Irving
Berlin’s classic song “White Christ-
mas,” describes a snowfall as being a
“-womblike blanket of comfort, faith
and love." Looking out the window
after a fall — or better yet, venturing
out into the cool air to chap one's lips
and be an eyewitness to the marvel
—— would certainly afﬁrm these

' beautiful words. While a postcard
rendition of a snowfall would most ,_

likely feature a patch of woods or a
country vision, this writer would
have to contend that even in the
cruelest of inner cities, the snow
maintains her power, beauty and

, grandeur.

After a heavy snowfall, a rusted
and boarded-up shack becomes a
luminescent white sculpture. A beat-
up and abandoned car becomes a
serene and shrub-like ﬁgure on the
winter horizon. A street, pockmarked

with potholes and grafﬁti, is trans-
formed into a dreamy path. Snow
provides beauty in otherwise ugly
and harsh environs.

A heavy snowfall reminds an
indifferent world that nature is
indeed supreme. Intersections,
lawn and property divisions,

Michael
Moore

markers and parking spaces —
all symbols of Man’s arbitrary
manipulation and division of the
land — are erased. All territory is
once again claimed by the,heav-
ens and her magical snow. Until
the snowplows and shovels are
put to work, we are called upon
to stop to worship the debilitat-
ing beauty. Snow piled on the
earth is a euphoric paralysis.
Kids love snow by the inches,
as it provides them with relief
from school and the opportunity
to frolic in the playful powder.
Snowmen claim the earth, re-
placing the busy pedestrian off
to work. Sledding and snowballs
whisk children away from their
Nintendo sets and their condemn-
ing call to automated play. What’s
more, snow equalizes the oppor-
tunity for fun: even the children
without expensive toys can en-
joy the wonderment of winter.

Nature reminds us of her pu-
rity with snow, challenging us to
ask ourselves if we are truly ap-
preciative of living in the mighty
domain that we continually
abuse. It is Man who turns
mountains of snow into piles of
ﬁlth. Soot mixed with snow re-
sults in an illustration of our
mistreatment of the land, and
invokes a challenge of anag-
norisis.

Nature claims lives with disas-
ters beyond our control and
deprives others of vital resources,
yet she always soothes us with a
crisp, white comforter after a
snowfall. When we cry out in

painful confusion and become
alienated over analyzing our re-
lationship to nature —— there ar-
rives the snowfall. A week after

I Ceausescu’s assassination, snow

descended upon the city. In
Romania, this writer would sug-
gest that a very memorable “White

Christmas" was celebrated by the 1

people. After a red bloodshed, a
white blanket; after a terrifying
murder spree, a calm cast. Vio-
lence-torn Romania —- like .the
northern inner city —— is not
forsaken of beauty and serenity.
Snow, like life itself, is but an
ephemeral enterprise. Just as soon
as the coatingof comfort is placed
upon this world, a process of

disappearance and ugly removal «

soon follows. Here in the cityof
Pittsburgh, ‘a grand pre-Christ-
mas snow melted at the passage
of the new year. Just as soon as
the splendor faded, an unfortu-
nate event of ironically opposite
proportions occurred: the spill-
ing of oil into the Monongahela
River. Once again, the harsh
imperfection of life was thrust
upon us. The news continued its
telling of stories of ugliness,
misfortune, violence, deception,
abuse, apathy and manipulation.
With her whipping wind and

0 occasional frozen rain, the sky

here produced very little in the
way of snow. Gray and dreary
became the weatherman’s most
hackneyed words. Itwas the stuff
that aggravates seasonal disor-

ders and helps drive people into,

deep depression, rekindling feel-
ings of sadness, loss and loneli-
ness.

But suddenly a work of glory
captivated the city: a snowfall to
be measured by a ruler and reali-
zations of beauty. Ah, what a
magniﬁcent sight it was, with
rays of sun yet, that reflected
upon the white blanket. It was
quite a wonderful rejuvenation
of hope.

Let it snow, let it snow, let it
snow.

their minds. I think what
happened at the meeting is simply
a result of a long series of actions
which repeatedly have shown an
insensitivity to faculty and faculty
concerns of continual demands
to “trust us” but a refusal on their
part to put any trustinthe faculty,”
said Wion.

Psychology professor Donald
McBurney said that the freeze
itself was not what angered him,
but rather the way in which the
administration handled the issue.

“Buget policies commitee meets
every weeek and part of the
agenda every meeting is the
budget cycle report by Mr. Yeager
where he tells us what is going
on with respect to Harrisburg,
prospects in funding, budget
changes and the like. Budget
policies met on January 26th at
which Mr Yeager made the
customary report and did not
breath 21 word of any hiring
freeze,” he said.

McBurney said that he believes
the hiring freeze decision was
made on January 24th and that
Yeager’s actions are typical of the
administration.

“ I think it tells us a great deal
about the budget policy
committee’s role in the budgetting
process. I think it shows how the
president and the administation
treats the committee. They say
that we are consulted and that we
have full access to the
administration but here is a
decision made without our

consultation and without even

an opinion given,” he said.

The assembly passed, by a vote
of 15-7, a resolution urging the
administration to reconsider the
hiring freeze.

Georgetown coachjohn Thompson's play calling will have to be right if the Hoyas are to stop
Panther Jason Matthews, who leads the Big East in three point accuracy.

Win streak
in jeopardy
at G'toWn

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

When Pitt faced
Georgetown at the Civic Arena
on Jan. 8, the Panthers’ season
was sinking fast, and few
people were giving them a
chance to resurface.

After the Hoyas beat them,
87-71, things looked even
worse. Their record dropped
to 0-3 in the Big East and 5-8
overall. Everyone claimed that
without a solid bench, Pitt
didn’t stand so much of a
chance to even out their overall
record.

Now, less than a month later,
thanks to the Panthers winning
four of their last five games, a
win at Georgetown tonight
will balance their record at 10-
10 and make them 4-5 in the
Big East. Georgetown is now
17-2 overall and 7-2 in the
conference.

As for the lack of Pitt’s bench,
Pitt is basically playing with
the same rotation, with little
exception. One small change
is center Darren Morningstar’s
performance. In the last two
games, Morningstar is
averaging nine points (up from
his season average of four)
and continues to mix it up
with the other big men of the
conference.

Pitt starting shooting guard
Jason Matthews, who averages
over 38 minutes per game,
appreciates any help he can
get, no matter where it comes
from. “Every little bit helps.
whether it’s from off the bench
or from Darren or whoever.
Hopefully Darren is coming
around and getting more

Seton Hall Warm—up for ladies’ upcoming challenges

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Kirk Bruce doesn’t know the meaning of the word depression.

The Pitt women’s basketball coach has had to deal with a 1989-
'90 team which boasts a roster of five freshman out of eleven
players.

The only seniors returning from last year are Jen Shingler and
forward Lorri Johnson, who is one of the top players in the Big
East. Johnson, however, has suffered from arthritis in her knee
which has kept her from being at full capability throughout the
season, and Shingler is coming off two bad sprains of her right
ankle.

But Bruce can wake up tomorrow morning with a legitimate
chance to move into the upper echelon of the Big East Conference,
a creditable accomplishment due to the fact that the Lady Panthers
found themselves in the cellar of the Big East last year.

The Lady Panthers face a talented Seton Hall team at the Field
House tonight (7:30 tipoff), and with a win, can almost certainly
dream of climbing out of the dregs of the Big East Conference.

Throughout it all Bmce has been the ultimate optimist, and his
patience may have finally paid off with the help of one of the best
recruiting classes in years at Pitt.

“I think looking at our schedule that it favors us,” Bruce said.

Pitt has four of their last six games at home, including three of
the favorites to win the Big East - Syracuse, Connecticut, and
Villanova.

The Lady Panthers have lost to those aforementioned squads on
the road in the first part of the season, but Bruce feels that the
experience that his freshmen have gained could make a difference
in the upcoming rematches.

“Freshman sometimes have the great moments and the not—so-
great moments, and I think we’ve seen that from all of them this
year,” Bruce said. “But they’re all doing fine.”

Bruce praised frosh forward Turia Ransom for her strong inside
play against Providence, which is in second place in the conference
and got out of Pittsburgh with a 101-90 win last week. Ransom had
21 points and 16 rebounds against the Lady Friars.

Maureen McConnell (9.6 points and 4.7 assists per contest) has
started every game so far this year at the point guard position,
while Jill McElhinny (7.6 ppg) and Lisa Fessler (6.4) ppg have been
forces. Forward Tiffany Fingers also has seen action.

Johnson (19.2 ppg) did not play in the Providence game last
week because of her knee, but Bruce said that she had one of her
best practices of the year yesterday and will most certainly be
ready to go tonight against a 16-4 Seton Hall team. .

address
problems

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Be happy you’re not in Darryl
Strawberry’s shoes. In the 10 days
before he admitted himself to the
Smithers Alcohol Rehabilitation
Center in New York last weekend,
Strawberry was found to be the
father of an illegitimate child of a
woman in St. Louis and was

 

arrested for alleged assault with a
deadly weapon after a dispute
with his wife.

Cincinnati Reds outfielder and
Strawberry’s longtime friend Eric
Davis said that he feels Strawberry
is not an alcoholic and is only at
the rehab center “to alleviate some
of his other problems.”

While we may never know
whether Strawberry had an
alcohol problem throughout his
career, or even if he has one now,
one thing remains certain:
Strawberry needs help, and an
alcohol center was probably the
only place he could turn to.

The above incidents were just
the latest in a long line which has
plagued Strawberry throughout
his career:

-The “Straw” man has been
fined ﬁve times in ﬁve years for
showing up late to batting
practices, workouts and photo
sessions.

oTwice he has charged the
pitcher's mound after being hit
by a pitch in spring training.

-He has criticized his manager
and teammates throughout his
career, and even took a swing at
teammate Keith Hernandez last
year after an argument.

Baseball has treatment plans
for alcohol and for drugs, but no
programs exist for athletes who
have trouble in society. While it’s
true that drugs and alcohol are
directly related to criminal
behavior, nothing is done to help
athletes avoid committing crimes
or mining their family life, which
in the long run might help prevent
relapses.

It’s time for the owners (in all
sports) and the players’
associations to set up mandatory
programs to teach athletes about
societal dangers that can devastate
their lives as well as their careers.
Lessons in such subjects as
marriage relations, sex education,
money management and stress
management would help to take

Gymnastics teams host meet

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

If you enjoy watching gymnastics and have
been waiting for the team to host a home meet,
you’re in luck. The Pitt men’s and women’s
gymnastics teams will be co-hosting this
weekend’s meet against Temple and Kent State
at Trees Hall on Sunday at 2 p.m.

Debbie Yohman, the head coach for the Lady
Panthers, says that meet will offer a different
atmosphere for all of the teams competing
because of the the number of events going on at
the same time.

“It’s exciting, because the [members of the
men’s team] are not just in the stands cheering
for our team, they’re actually on the ﬂoor,” said
Yohman. “When you have time, you take a look
at what the guys are doing, and you cheer for
them. When they have a break, they'll look over
and see what you’re doing, and it becomes like
a three-ring circus.”

Yohman said that the meet will have at least
three events going on at any given time. “The
guys will have at least one event going on, while
the women will have at most two events at one

time,” said Yohman. “If [men’s coach Frank.

D’Arnicol gets four judges, then the guys will

have two events going on at one time."

The present plans are that the men will
participate in one or two events at a time, and
two of the women's teams will compete together,
while the other women's team will be given a
by-pass.

The meet will run at a fast pace, and there will
always be an event in progress throughout the
meet.

“The announcer doesn't have the time to
announce the scores and the running scores, so
nobody in the audience knows what's going on,
unless they are catching the scores being ﬂashed
and recording them themselves," said Yohman.

Yohman is anticipating a close meet with
Temple. “T emple is scoring the same as [we are].
It will be two evenly matched teams, and
whoever hits the best, whoever has the fewest
mistakes or the fewest falls, will take the meet,”
said Yohman. “I have not heard any scores from
Kent this year, but I have heard that they’re not
doing well. They’re a rather weak team.”

Yohman is anticipating a large turnout for the
meet. “We always have a big crowd when we
have a meet with the men because we have the
people that are interested in our program and
the people that are interested in the men’s

program.”

conﬁdence,” said Matthews.
Morningstar will have his hands
full tonight against Georgetown’s
huge inside game. Alonzo
Mourning (6—foot—10) and
Dikembe Mutombo (7—foot-2)

' make their living swatting shots

and generally just being nuisances
to other teams’ inside games.
Mourning is sixth in scoring in
the Big East averaging 18.3 ppg.,
and Mutombo is fourth in
rebounding, collecting over nine
per game.

“They have a bunch of trees;
it’s up to us to go down there and
chop them down," said Pitt sixth-
man Rod Brookin.

Pitt counters inside with All-
everything Brian Shorter and
Bobby Martin. Shorter leads the
Big East in scoring (21.3 ppg.)
and is third in rebounding (9.6).
After Pitt defeated Arizona on
Jan. 27, Wildcat Coach Lute Olson
said that he couldn't imagine
anybody being as good as Shorter
is at his height, which is 6—foot—6.

Both teams also boast
exceptional back courts.

Matthews is third in the league in
scoring (19.1) and leads the
league in three-point ﬁeld-goal
percentage (.487). Matthews’
three-point shooting adds more
to Pitt’s game that just points.

“If I’m hitting from the outside,
it just opens it up more for Bobby,
Brian and Rod Brookin," said
Matthews. f‘But in Rod’s case, he
can play inside or outside."

Pitt point guard Darelle Porter
is the conference leader in assists
at 8.1 per game.

As for the Hoya guards, Mark
Tillmon does the scoring, and
Dwayne Bryant does the handling
and passing. Tillmon scores more
than 20 points per game, good
for second behind Shorter in the
Big East. He is also second behind
Matthews in three—point field-
goal percentage.

“Tillmon is having a great year
so far, and Bryant is an excellent
ball handler. I expect them to
make a few changes because I
think we showed them in the
second half of our first game that
we can come back and play with
them,” said Matthews.

Strawberry has as much_ raw

I won't say that Strawberry
should not take responsibility for
his own actions, but some blame
should also be attributed to the

Panthers/eiers place second

I A lack of snow prevented this weekend’s National Collegiate
Skiing Association Invitational from being held at Snow Peak
Lodge. After‘ rescheduling the meet at Seven Springs, only an

impressive performance by Penn State prevented Pitt from — 0

winning the NCSA team title.

The Panther Ski Racing Team finished second out of 14 -

schools and lost the overall title to the Nittany Lions.

Pitt was pacedby three racers who placed highly in the giant-
slalom standings. Carl Skylling led the Panthers with a second-
place finish, Rob Alarcon ﬁnished fourth and Tony Carestia

took ninth. The highest Lady Panther ﬁnisher was Karin Helm, ‘_

who captured fourth.

“If our team continues to be aggressive, we have a good
chance of going to regionals for the first time," said David
Freeman, co-president of the Panther squad. ‘
