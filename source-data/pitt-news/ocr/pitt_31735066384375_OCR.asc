Shapp '3 Budget: No Increase for Pitt

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG——Education and
We1fare—the biggest spenders of
state money—are the primary
losers in the Shapp Administra-
tion’s 1978-1979 budget.

The $5.77 billion general fund
budget unveiled yesterday also
carries no provision for a salary
increase for state workers and
maintains state colleges and
universities at current spending
levels.

Pitt’s appropriation for last year

was $60.5 million and it requested
$70.4 million for this year.
Education consumes almost 50
percent of the‘ general fund, the
state’s day-to-day spending plan.
Health, economic development and
welfare programs take 33 percent
and the rest goes for recreation,
corrections and other programs.

Shapp, saying his hands are tied
by legislative mandates, proposes
to drop the state's basic instruction

, subsidy from $1.293 billion to

$1.243 billion.

The school » aid decrease was
attributed primarily to the declining
birth rate, which means fewer
students are attending public
schools.‘ The subsidy formula is
partially based on student enroll-
ment.

However, the total Education
Department budget increased from
$2.6 to $2.7 billion. Most of the
additional spending is for aid to the
handicapped—up almost $11 mil-
lion-—and pupil transportation—up
more than $28 million.

Spending on the handicapped has
increased dramatically since the
state agreed to expand special
education training in 1972. Shapp
wants $109 million for special
education programs, compared
with $85 million two years ago.

For welfare recipients, the
administration recommends a $15.4
million cut in some medical
beneﬁts, including less money for
drugs, dental and other services.

Total state spending for the
Welfare Department goes from
$1.715 billion to $1.947 billion.

Minority students now compose nine percent
of Pitt’s undergraduate population, according to
a report on enrollment at the Pitt campuses
released this week by the University’s Office of
Affirmative Action. .

Of the 19,109 students attending the Oakland
campus, 1740 are minority students. Fourteen
hundred and ninety-six, or seven percent, of
these 1740 students are black students, the report
shows.

According to Maryann F. Bishop, University
Affirmative Action director, the report, which

registration, is more accurate that a similar
report released last year which used information
collected from students who voluntarily returned
questionnaires sent to them by the Office of Af-
firmative Action. _

Response rate to the’1977 study was 80 per-
cent, while only 20 percent of the student
population responded to the 1976 study, Bishop
said.

The low response rate to the 1976 survey
caused some inaccuracies, reported Bishop, who
commented that there are no reliable statistics on

tion, she contended that more must be done in
the area of affirmative action in the future.

‘ ‘We haven’t made as much progress as we had
hoped to have by this time, but I’m not at all
ready to give up yet,” Bishop commented.
“While we’ve made some progress, there might
be much more we can do in the future, given that
we all try a little harder.”

Bishop attributes Pitt’s gains in affirmative ac-
tion partly to the support accorded by Chan-
cellor Posvar. “Chancellor Posvar, since he has

Lightning
Gauge Made
By Engineers

~ By PATTY TASCARELLA

‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt engineers have developed
an instrument that measures the
force and pattern of lightening
strikes in electric power systems.

The device, resulting from study
conducted in 1975 by the University
and scientists from General Elec-
tric Corporation’s test laboratories
in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, will
be used to aid the development of
utility hardware that will reduce
power shortages and blackouts
caused when lightening bolts strike
electrical power systems.

According to Pitt electrical
engineering professor George Ku-
sic, the device is a small
rectangular box mounted on a pole
with a probe extending to the
lightening arrester.

ODI Forum Explores ~
Area Redevelopment

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Area residents participated in a A
public forum Monday to discuss
Oakland redevelopment plans.

The forum, held at the First
Baptist Church at the corner of
Bayard and Bellefield Streets, was
sponsored by Oakland Directions
Inc., (ODI). Goals and objectives

= for future improvement of the
‘ Oakland area were discussed.

The meeting was termed ‘ ‘a joint

-planning process” by ODI Presi-

dent James Ray, a Presbyterian
minister with the University and
City Ministry.

Representatives of Urban, Design
Associates, a consulting ﬁrm hired
by ODI to explore and formulate
goals for renovation in Oakland
were present at the meeting.

Senior partners David Lewis and
Ray Gindroz presented a slide show
with maps of traffic congestion,
residential areas, and institutional
(University and hospitals) areas.

Interviews involving 300 stu-

dents, residents and workers in
Oakland were conducted by the
firm this past year.

The interviews showed that
Oakland residents were most
concerned about litter, parking and
traffic problems, as well as
institutional and business expan-
sion into residential areas.

Lewis and Gindroz pointed out
the main areas of concern were the
residential “edges” and “por-
tals,” or those areas closest to
business, institutions, and parkway
exits. ‘

From the interviews and their
own investigations, UDA presented
the following goals for redevelop-
ment:

—stabilize and upgrade residen-
tial neighborhoods

—upgrade the business district

—promote self-renewal of Oak-
lands institutions in response to
change and pressures from growth

—develop a total transportation

Pitt's Medical Volunteers

By SUEMcFARLAND
‘Pitt News Staffwriler

Minutes after last January’s
Langley Hall explosion members of
Pitt's Peer ‘Medical Aide Program
(PMAP) were on the scene,
administering life saving cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and
assisting in the control of the
panic-stricken crowd gathered
around the blast site.

Although not all emergencies
handled by PMAP are as severe as
the Langley Hall disaster, this
group of selected student volun-
teers sponsored by the Medical

‘Action Committee of Student
- Government and certiﬁed by the

American Red Cross and the
American Heart Association says it
is prepared to handle any emergen-
cy situation.

Members of PMAP are chosen on
the basis of an interview with
present members of the organiza-

tion and Student Health educator
Bob La Civita.

At least one semester of campus
living is required, but no prior
knowledge of emergency health
care is necessary for membership.
Some but not all PMA’s are
interested in pursuing a career in

the health professions. Candidates *

are required to successfully com-
plete an intensive 40 hour training
program which involves legal
liability, shock and its manage-
ment, obstetrical emergencies,
control of hemorrhage, CPR and a
variety of first-aid procedures.
“We are not trying to take the
place of the doctor, we’re not
trained for that,” said PMAP
student Co-Director Marcie
Goldberg, “but instead we are just
trying to do the best we can,
whether it is talking to a student or
helping them with a health problem
that they might not feel right in

AUDITIONS TO BE HELD

Performances of Brahms Reqium,
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the
music of Rodgers & Hammerstein will be
presented by the MENDELSSOHN
CHOIR OF PITTSBURGH this spring.
The choir will hold auditions for new
members on Sunday evening, February
12, 1978. Those interested should call

calling the campus police about.”

Goldberg said members are
frequently called to the residence
halls to administer care for minor
injuries.

“We deal with all types of
medical emergencies ranging from
someone falling and spraining an
ankle to alcohol and drug abuse to
birth control,” Goldberg said.

Under the Good Samaritan Act,
PMA’s cannot be held liable for
assisting in medical emergencies
unless gross negligence or intent to
perform a harmful act can be
proven.

LaCivita stated that PMAP
governs and trains itself, thereby
making it one of the few
health-oriented student organiza-
tions in the nation. PMAP members
are not reimbursed for services they
render to the residence halls.

The role of PMAP extends
beyond that of administering
emergency medical assistance.
Since the group’s inception in
September of 1976 they have
conducted a series of workshops on
such topics as CPR forresident
assistants and other interested
students. At the present time,
LaCivita has engaged the assistance
of the Peer Medical Aides to
distribute the results of the Student
Health Risk Proﬁle, a survey mailed
to all incoming students this past
summer. The survey asked ques-
tions pertaining to the student’s
lifestyle and a multitude of
questions pertaining to the
student’s work and leisure time
activities as well as his psychologi-
cal feelings toward himself.

From the results of these surveys
a calculation was made to determine
whether the individual’s personal
habits and history increase or
decrease the student’s life ex-
pectancy.

These results are now available at
the Peer Medical Aide offices in the
ground floor of Holland Hall South
for inspection by any new student
who mailed his form to the health
service before Sept. 10, 1977.

Peer medical aides will be on duty
on the weekends to explain the
results of the survey and make
suggestions as to how the student
might improve his lifestyle, thus
increasing their health and life
expectancy.

La Civita said that from the
results of the survey it was
discovered the majority of the
student population at Pitt is in good
health.

that has a lightening arrester,”
Kusic said. “The ﬁrst project was
to put them on distribution lines
that bring power to houses.”

The device recently passed a
number of tests in the Pittsﬁeld
laboratory. Scientists are currently
waiting for contracts enabling them
to test the device in the ﬁeld.

“Our work has essentially been
done since we developed the
instrument and delivered it to the
Department of Energy,” Kusic
said. “But we will continue to
study the project.”

Kusic said a test device had been

set on top of the Cathedral of
Learning for almost a year.

“We’ve taken it down now to
convert some of the currents." _he
said. ‘‘It is also winter. The device
is only-useful during the lightening
seasons.”

The Department of Energy now
is testing the instrument in areas
that receive a large amount of
lightening, such as Arizona and St.
Petersburg, Fla, where the best
data are obtainable. Also, these
regions are where the device will
likely be pressed into widespread
use.

wants to fulﬁll when the Univer-
sity’s budget is in effect being
cut,” she said.

Every department and every
school of the university operates its
own affirmative action program,
recruiting minority students and
faculty members for each area.
The ofﬁces of afﬁrmative action,
admissions and student aid coor-
dinate all affirmative action by the
various schools.

The Admissions Office recruit-

ment program includes visiting ‘V

communities and cities where
minorities attend school; contac-
ting high schools through period-
ical visits to administrators and
faculty of schools with minority
populations; attending recruitment
meetings designed for ‘minority
students, and inviting prospective
minority students and their parents
to sessions specifically about Pitt.
Dean of Admissions and Student
aid, Kenneth J. Wegner, stressed
that giving personal attention to
possible minority students is a
major part of Pitt's drive to attract
minority students. “I think we have
given a lot of minority students
personal attention for such a large

school.” said Weneer.
In the past ﬁve or six years, we

have had a very nice increase in the
number of minority students in the
freshman class," he concluded.

LOS ANGELES—A man claiming to be the Hillside Strangler
said in a letter made public Tuesday that he killed a dozen “evil
ladies" because his mother told him to.

Police, stressing that they did not know whether the letter was
authentic, said the writer gave them “another week or so” to meet
his call for help in turning himself in safely, and threatened
“something serious” if authorities failed to respond.

Assistant Police Chief Daryl F. Gates read reporters the ﬁrst
page of the pencil-printed, six-page letter mailed last month to
Mayor Tom Bradley. The lined school notebook page said:

“Dear Mr. Mayor, ,

“PLEASE listen to me. I am very sick, but I do not want to go
back to that place. I hate that place. My mother told me to kill
those evil ladies. It’s not my fault.. .Mother makes my head hurt.
That’s why I kill her. But I can’t get her out of my head. She keeps
coming back. That’s why I hate her.”

Gates said the writer claimed to have a particular item that
would prove he is the strangler. Gates refused to identify the item
but said if the writer did have it police would be inclined to believe
he is really the killer.

Blackmailers Foiled
By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—Two Allegheny County men were indicted
Tuesday on charges that they éonspired to blackmail
Commissioner Robert N. Peirce Jr. with photographs taken at a
suburban motel. I

The seven-count federal indictment alleged McKeesport
residents Edward Reddington and bail bondsman David Wander,
both 62, induced a woman drug defendant to compromise Peirce in
March 1973.

Peirce, a Republican, was clerk of courts at the time.

The woman, identified as Michael Lynn Currie, 27, of Florida,
was threatened with conviction and jail, and told she would lose
custody of her child unless she cooperated, the indictment said.

Ms. Currie knew Peirce before the incident, said U.S. Attorney ,
Blair A. Griffith. The relationship was not personal, he added.

Griffith said the plot was designed to inﬂuence Peirce's official
duties as collector of forfeited bail bonds.

Wander, whose agency writes about 30 percent of all bail bonds
in the county, owed Allegheny County for bonds forfeited when
defendants failed to appear in court, Griffith noted.

There was no evidence that Peirce complied with the alleged
blackmail attempt, he said.

Community Relations

The goals outlinedat Monday’s meeting of Oakland Directions
Inc. (a local community group) should be duly noted by the ad-

ministration.

According to a survey commissioned by ODI, litter, parking
space, traffic, congestion and institutional and business expansion

top the list of concerns within the Oakland community. In respon-

se to these and other problems, ODI hopes to see community action

~ directed toward stabilization and upgrading of residential areas,

renewal of the Oakland business district, improved transportation

. facilities and greater personal safety. .

These goals, if realized, can only benefit students and employees
here. But they can only be realized with the close cooperation of
Oakland’s ubiquitous University community. 5

The greatest burden for this cooperation falls on the ad-
ministration. The period of University expansion—which, in many
ways, has been detrimental to University/ community relations——is
said to be over. It is time for Pitt to accept its responsibility for the
massive intrusions it has made into the non-University community

here.

Working in close cooperation with ODI and similar groups
(South Oakland Citizens Council, for instance), the administration
should seek to help Oakland develop according to the wishes of all
the citizens here—and not just according to what is convenient for
or beneficial to the University, as has often been the case in the

past

I would like to clear up the

the case. I believe that this

that this is an unjust and slanted
view of the proceedings. How an

-beyond comprehension. It is my

opinion that it was The Pitt News’
obligation to get all the facts on the
story. Simply ask Karen Kadilak or
any of the CAS Council members.
I do not wish to go into detail,
refuting all the statements that the
column made. But I ﬁrmly believe
that if the writer had been truly
interested in the issue, he/ she
would have taken the time to get the
story. I am sadly disappointed to
see that after all our hard work to
straighten out (he issue, a
prestigious and quality paper such
as the Pitt News muddles up the

Our request for accreditation is
not only based upon a tale of

much, much stronger than that.

Letters to the Editor

Negotiations and the Palestinian Problem

In response to the column of Julie
Graham, “Israeli Expansion &
Palestinian Rights,” Jan. 23, 1978,
a number of points need to be
clariﬁed.

1. Israel realizes and accepts the
rights of the Palestinians for
self-determination as has been
expressed by Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, (see the Prime
Minister’s self rule plan as read to
the Knesset (Israeli Parliament)
points 19 & 21, dealing with the
establishment of a joint adminis-
trative council). But Israel does not
recognize the PLO as the authorized
representatives of the Palestinian
people. This is based on the
following facts: V

a) The PLO is a self-proclaimed
body. Palestinians have not duly
elected the PLO as their represen-
tatives.

b) The PLO .is a terrorist
organization which rejects the

ledged principle of Israel’s right of
existence. In fact, parts of its
charter call for. the destruction of
Israel.

2. All territories that are now
under Israeli administration be-
came such during wars waged
against Israel.

3. Israel is ready to compromise
in order to establish true peace in
the Middle East, but the parties
have to realize that it has to be
achieved through negotiations. The
recent suspension of the talks was
on Egyptian initiative. Egyptian
Foreign Minister Kamel wanted to
dictate the terms of the negotiations
from the moment he stepped foot in
the Israeli airport.

4. Israel gaveback territory after
1956 in the hope of establishing a
peace agreement. It did not bring a
lasting peace, and in 1967 another
war was imposed on Israel.

5. Everyone refers to President
Sadat’s trip to Jerusalem as a
mmnmmise to be construed as part
of the negotiation. Actually the trip
to. Jerusalem signalled only the
recognition of Israel (which is not a
part of the negotiation process but
only a precondition to negotiation).
In the past all the Israeli leaders

Reader Objects to Recent Letter on Israeli History

In a recent letter to the editor,
Diana Ellis bemoaned the ‘ ‘tragic. . .
rewriting of history by Zionist
apologists.” However, in decrying
what she considers distortions of
history, she fails to enlighten us
with her own supposedly correct
version of the history of the Middle
East.

She proceeded to impugn the
judicial "system of Israel for trying
and imprisoning spies and terror-
ists. But the mere fact that a man
like Adolf Eichmann was able to get
a fair trial in Israel and that his
hanging was the only execution in
the history of the country belies

Arab countries and gave an open
invitation to Arab leaders to have
direct peace negotiations.

6. The origin of the Palestinian
refugee problem is not of Israel’s
creation. Since the inception of the
state, Israel has repeatedly offered
Arab residents full equality and
citizenship. The continuation of the
refugee problem is the direct result
of Arab insistence on maintaining
the refugee camps as political
pawns and Arab refusal to
repatriate these people or to use all
the opportunities up to now to
create an autonomy for the region.
For 19 years the West Bank was in
Jordanian hands (1948-1967); a
Palestinian state was never estab-

lished. At the same time Israel has

taken the full responsibility of
Jewish refugees from all over the
world without ever asking another
country for help with their
refugees-—and there are some Jews
living in Arab countries that don't
even have the right to become
refugees. What then gives anyone
the moral right to assume that the
destiny of its refugees is the
responsibility of another govern-
ment?

7. The writer refers to Arab unity,
unfortunately the tragedy is that the
only real Arab unity expressed has
been unity against Israel.

Comments on Prof. Burkoff’s Column,
Which Warned of Dangers in Convention

This letter is in regard to a
statement made by John Burkoff in
the article of Jan. 23, “Senate
Testimony on Constitutional Con-
vention.”

Burkoff states that the United
States Constitution serves to
protect individuals who are not in
so powerful a position that they can
protect themselves adequately in
our political sysgem. It’s obvious,
however, that the least powerful.
and yet the least protected
individuals, in our country today
are unborn children, so frequently
lost to abortion.

For this reason, legal steps,
including passage of House Bill 71
must be taken to ensure their
protection from conception to birth.

Mary. Luthy

The crux of Prof. John Burkoff’ s
testimony regarding House Bill 71
was apparently his question:
“What can the Congress or the
courts or the states do about the
Convention after the fact?” This is
not a rhetorical question. It is
disappointing that, not even a
self-serving answer was given.
Based on information provided by
our legal counsel, I suggest the
following reply:

(1) Congress can take possession
of a Convention’s work and discard
it. This power was available to the
Continental Congress in 1787.

(2) The courts are available to
redress any misconduct by a
Convention. This is the expert
opinion of the prestigiousAmerican
Bar Association. See 1974 Final
Report, ABA Special Constitutional
Convention Study Committee. ,

(3) The states can reject the
Convention’s proposal. The 1787
Convention was almost rejected in
this way.

Yoga Teacher Bends Student Bodies, Minds

Concentratlon seems to be the key to this yoga student's pretzel-like pose.

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Relax. Relax," the dapper
instructor says to the class
reclining on the matted ﬂoor. The
students lying comfortably on their
backs, breathe deeply, listening to
Narendra Rathore’s modulated
voice.

And another yoga class at Pitt
begins, with graduate assistant
Rathore leading 30 students
through the exercises of Ratha-
yoga.

While his students twist their
bodies into the contorted positions
of yoga, Rathore stands at the front
of the class, intently watching their
efforts. Seeing a student struggling
to gain thercorrect position, he
walks quietly to her, and moves her
feet and torso into the correct pose.
He bends over the student,
whispering a few words of advice or
encouragement. In thickly accented
English, Rathore tells the class to
rest, then commands them to
assume a new position.

Rathore, a trim Indian with
bulging shoulder muscles and an
intense, searching gaze, brings
years of experience with yoga to his
students. At the age of ﬁve he
began learning yoga from his
father, a landlord of farmland in
Rajasthan and a member of the
Kshatriya (warrior or ruling) class.
In India, yoga was a required
course of study for Rathore.

When he was forced to study
yoga, Rathore rebelled, promising
himself he would quit yoga when
he was older. After not practicing
yoga for four or ﬁve months,
Rathore found he was less flexible.
He began practicing yoga again,

teaching himself to enjoy the
discipline.

“When yoga was compulsory, I
didn’t like it, and I decided I was
not going to do it when I was
older,” Rathore recalled. “When I
went to college, I did many sports
besides yoga, but I realized my
body was not completely in tune.
So, I started yoga again.”

After earning an M.A. in
political science in India, Rathore
left India for Europe. He lived for a
year with friends of his family in
Paris, the French Riviera and
Switzerland, while teaching yoga
classes.

Another friend of Rathore’s
family, a doctor in the Pittsburgh
area, sent him an application for
admission to Pitt’s physical educa-
tion graduate program because of
Rathore’s interest in physical
education. In 1975, after being
accepted for admission to Pitt.
Rathore came to the United States
for the first time.

When Rathore first began
teaching yoga at Pitt in winter term
1975, there never had been a yoga
class at Pitt.

The demand for the class now is
overwhelming, according to
Rathore. “I originally asked that
the class be limited to 20 people,”
he said, “but there was so much
interest, there now are 30 people in
the class."

Students attracted to the class
for diverse reasons—to learn to
relax, to lose weight, to increase
conditioning, to learn discipline-
ﬁnd that Rathore creates a relaxed
atmosphere in which learning the
positions of yoga is easy.

“He’s super encouraging, but
he's not'demanding,” senior
English literature major Barbara
Beggs said about Rathore. “It’s
(the class) not competitive at all. It
doesn't matter if the person beside
you can bend into a pretzel.” '

‘Ken Isaacman, a junior chemis-
try major, said he believes
Rathore’s voice contributes greatly
to the class’s relaxed atmosphere.
“His voice is just so melodious it
almost puts you to sleep,” said
Isaacman. '

Student also say they enjoy the
no-pressure atmosphere created by
Rathore. “I don't have to feel
embarrased or anything in the
class, and it makes me try harder,”
said Rose Mary Colecchia, a junior
mathimajor. “If I do an exercise, I
do it because I want to do it."

Rathore shows great concern for
every student in his class, inquiring
about students‘ progress and
asking them if yoga is helping them
reach their goals. such as losing
weight. During the class, he always
helps students to assume the
correct yoga pose when they have
trouble.

“He (Rathore) stopped me one
day after class and asked me if I’m
losing weight." said freshman
Kathy Modany. “He's always
worring about an overweight girl in
the class. or asking a girl in
volleyball if yoga is helping her
game."

‘ ‘Narendra seems concerned,”
said Isaacman. “He encourages
people to practice on their own, and
helps them in class. but he won’t
push them to a point they do not
want to reach.”

Although Rathore coaches ﬁeld
hockey at the Ellis School and also
teaches soccer and ﬁeldhockey, he
loves to' teach yoga. Rathore
conducts classes at the Jewish
Community Center, the YMCA and
area libraries.

“Whenever I get the chance to
teach yoga, I will teach it,” said
Rathore. “I teach it every day
somewhere.”

Rathore said he loves yoga
because he is convinced it is the
best possible method of physical
conditioning. “My aim is to spread
yoga and to teach yoga," he said.
“It is the best possible exercise for
all ages.” Rathore, cited a
72-year-old man who attends his
classes as proof that a person of any
age can use yoga for conditioning.

The slow and deliberate move-
ments used in yoga are far superior
to other more energetic and
strenuous types of physical condi-
tioning, Rathore contended.

“When we do things slowly we
are more aware of what we are
doing and how it is affecting us,”
said Rathore. “When we do
exercises quickly, they are not as
effective, we jerk our muscles and
are sometimes injured. In yoga,
there is no jerking and no hurting
because the body can signal us to
stop when we move slowly. There
is no injury if it is done in the
proper way."

Rathore urges members of every
sports team to use yoga in their
training. Increased agility, better
flexibility, more stamina and
greater endurance are the benefits
athletes can gain from yoga.
according to Rathore.

“Those who are taking part in
any sport teams are very stiff—so
stiff that they can’t bend,” said.
Rathore. “They may be strong, but
they aren't ﬂexible. Yoga makes
you flexible."

Besides improving the body,
yoga increases a person’s mental
control, Rathore said. “You learn
to control anger, to quiet yourself
and to enjoy yourself through
yoga," said Rathore. “Yoga

’ teaches everything."

Evaluations written by Rathore’s
former students state that pa-
tience. self-discipline and relaxa-
tion are a few of the beneﬁts of
yoga. “I have learned to relax in
almost any situtation." wrote one
student. “I also generally feel
better about myself."

“I have learned to have patience
with myself. mentally and physical-
ly. and with other people," another
student wrote.

Knowing he brings both physical
and mental ﬁtness to his students
through yoga satisﬁes Rathore. “I
know people are getting beneﬁts
(from yoga), and that I am giving
them health in their lives," he said.
“When people are healthy. they
are ready to do whatever they
want. and can enjoy themselves."

“House of Blue Leaves ”Has Leaks

By LISA KELLY

The steps creakg as you duck
beneath boiler pipes that zig-zag
above your head. You wind down
narrow corridors of cinder block,
past the furnace, past a make-shift
lounge, past the workers’ time
clock. Only the usher stationed in
dark corners reassure you that,
yes, you are in the right place—The
Pittsburgh Playhouse Downstairs
Theater. A

This catacomb atmosphere
seems to say that Pittsburgh is a
city so busy with theater that
performances must take over and
convert whatever space they can
ﬁnd, even the basement of an old
playhouse.

Unfortunately, “The House of
Blue Leaves,” currently being
performed through Feb. 12 by the
Point Park College Theater Depart-
ment. reveals the disadvantage of
such quantity of material. Some-
times the search for new material
ends in the discovery of a play that
has good reason for not being
overdone or too well-known.

When you enter the little space
set aside for this production, you
step into someone’s livingroom in a
Meyran Ave. or Atwood St.

apartment, one of the last ones to
be rented in the fall. You see a dirty

one-armed sofa, a plastic television
set with a hanger antenna and a
tiny stove, refrigerator and table
shoved in the back of the set. There
are only ten short rows to ﬁll and
they are pushed so close to the set
that members of the audience keep

To some, the prospect of

attending an art exhibition is as
appealing as going to a Ladies’
Auxiliary Flower Show. But the Art
Nouveau exhibition in the Univer-
sity Art Gallery, Frick Fine Arts
Building, is more than just an art
show. It is a capsule of a most
appealing time period, a time when
the artistic imagination was recep-
tive both to change and to
experimentation, yet also clearly
possessed with romantic notion. A
spectrum of styles emerged that,
whatever their aesthetic value may
have been, nonetheless was the
connecting link to twentieth century
modern art.

Whatis Art Nouveau? A tough
question. Faced with such a
nebulous inclusion of decorative
and fine arts, it is easier to say that

Unfortunately, the characters are
written so that they very rarely

And the author expects the

ARTS 

Art Nouveau at F rick 1

seeing one Tiffany lamp is worth a
thousand deﬁnitions. Or one
Toulouse-Lautrec poster. Or one
Beardsley illustration. The forms of
expression and their media are as
varied as the artistic traditions from
which Art Nouveau borrowed:
Japanese, Gothic, Rococo art,
medieval poetry, legends and fairy
tales—all were unabashedly incor-
porated into new styles. The Art
Nouveau artist had eyes for the
ornate and the exotic, the lushest
of flowers and vines, the most
beautiful of animals. Everywhere,
the woman appears: represented
from high on the pedestal of
ethereal idealization down to the
frankest renderings of eroticism
and decadence.

The Art Nouveau exhibition at
Frick is a cross-section of the styles
and materials that this movement’s
artists presented. The show is
incomplete only in that a few

important figures in the movement,
notably Gustav Klimt, are not
represented. But this is because all
works were donated, and certain
artists’ works could not be had. The
exhibition is successful, though, in
providing a variety of examples
that, when taken as a whole, lend
definition to the term Art Nouveau.

When you go, be sure to viewiiilgér
rear room where the poster and
illustrative art is displayed. These
media of printmaking were enjoying
a golden age at the time
corresponding to Art Nouveau.
They, and other two-dimensional
works in the display, may have
stolen the show.

The exhibition’s ﬁnal day is
Sunday, Feb. 12. Hours are 10 a.m.

and his wife play two characters, Renaldo and Clara, who are examined
in relationship to each other. The ﬁlm includes 22 Dylan songs, as well as
‘:Hava Nagila” and Baez’s “Diamonds and Rust.”

 Will Mountaineers Try to Put Pitt in Box? 

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt gets a chance to prove
exactly what type of basketball team
it is when the Panthers travel to
Morgantown to battle West Virginia
tonight.

It is an old basketball axiom that
says a team’s quality may be
measured by the way it performs
after an embarrassing defeat.
Sunday’s drubbing at the hands of
Duquesne certainly qualiﬁes as that
kind of loss.

Pitt takes a 2-2 "league record
(11‘-7 overall) to Morgantown for the
rematch with the Mountaineers,
having won the first game, 71-66.
West Virginia, (3-5 in the league;
7-11 for the season) on the other
hand, needs a victory if it is to move
up from seventh place in the
Eastern Eight.

The question of whether the
Mountaineers will copy Duquesne
and employ the box-and-one
defense on Larry Harris is a major
point of interest surrounding
tonight’s game.

“After the success Duquesne had
with the box-and-one, it's a
possibility that we will see it in
Morgantown,” Pitt assistant coach
Fran Webster said. “If the other
fellows are putting the ball in the
hoop, the defense doesn’t work, but
we hope to be better prepared the
next time we see it.”

Pitt will be looking to return to
form in two important facets of its
game, rebounding and defense.
Prior to Sunday’s disaster, the
Panthers had been limiting their
opponents to just better than 71
points a game, while enjoying a
ﬁve-rebound-per-game advantage.

“The last game (against Du-'

quesne) was the first time we totally
broke down defensively all year,”
Webster said. “You have to keep
ahead of the offense so you are
dictating what happens, and
Duquesne just forced us to do some
things we didn’t want to.”

In the battle of the backboards,
Pitt will be facing the league’s
leading rebounder in the Moun-
taineers’ Maurice Robinson (11.5

player never ends, Pitt’s brother

per game). The Panthers will have
to stay out of foul trouble (easy to
get into in the Coliseum) to prevent
West Virginia from dominating the
inside. ,

“When any player picks up quick
fouls as (Ed) Scheuermann did
against Duquesne, it reflects on the
other players,” Webster said.
“They become hesitant underneath
because they see someone in foul
trouble and don’t want to get into
trouble themselves.”

Defensively, Pitt’s major area of
concern will be the Mountaineers’
six foot-one inch sophomore, Lowes
Moore. Moore is West Virginia’s
leading scorer, averaging better
than 19 points a game, while hitting
53 percent of his ﬁeld goal attempts.

“Our job will be to stop Moore,”
Webster said. “If we do that, and
get off to a good start, we”can come
away with a victory.”

Wayne Williams has been the
man opponents feel can be
pressured into turnovers, as the six
foot-two inch junior will be playing
point guard for only the eighth time
in his career.

“It’s just a matter of time before
Wayne gets into the groove as a
point guard,” Webster observed.
“He may not handle the ball as well
as many feel a major college point
guard should, but the other facets of
his game more than make up for it.
He’s the hardest worker on the team
and does all the things you would
want a player to do.

“We always tell the players to
keep their hands in their pockets
when we’re playing away from
home. You just don’t reach for the
ball unless you’re sure to get a piece
of it.”

Ultimately, it will be Pitt’s ability
to avoid reaching on defense and
groping on offense that will dictate
the outcome of the game.

Pitt News Staff Writer

In a penalty marred game, the
Pitt Panthers downed the Indiana
Indians, 5-3, as both teams were

whistled for 24 minor penalties, two
ﬁve-minute majors and one game

misconduct.

The game, which took three and
a half hours to play, had the
Panthers jump to an early 2-0 lead
before Indiana scored. Dave Elson
scored Pitt’s first goal at 6:31 of the
first period on passes from Curt
Hetz and Russ Stump. The Stein
brothers teamed up for Pitt’s
second goal, as Bob Stein passed
the puck to brother Rick, who
carried it behind the net and shot it
into the crease. The puck hit a
defenseman and deflected into the
net with goaltender George Collins
helpless to defend.

Indiana then answered with two
scores on Larry Newell who played
half the game, facing 20 shots.
(The other Panther netminder was
freshman Tom Silvka, who faced 14
shots and allowed one goal.)

Pitt then jumped to a 3-2 lead
when Tom Sherwin stuffed the
puck into the net at 17211 of the
second period for the Panthers’
first power-play goal. Russ Marks

~ scored the game winning goal 36

seconds later on passes from

throughout the year.

Ed Schourmann must stay out of foul trouble for Pitt to win.

“Back home, soccer is a big
event,” recalls Mark. “Stadiums
were full, but when we came to Pitt
we found just the opposite. There
were empty stadiums because of
little support from fans who knew
nothing about the game. When I
ﬁrst came to Pitt, the team played
kick-and-run, now it has developed
into a complex, sophisticated
game.”.

The Nigh brothers are two key
factors in the progression of Pitt
soccer. Along with senior goalie
Frank Bucci, Mark, a junior, and
Karl, a sophomore, were team
tri-captains. Both were essential in
raising Pitt’s record to 7-7-1 from
the previous years’ 4-7-2.

Both have been starting for Pitt
since their freshman year. Mark’s
three years on the team have been
spent playing a number of
positions, with his first two seasons
at halfback, receiving Most Valua-
ble Player honors his sophomore
year. This past season he played
wing and fullback, scoring four
goals and adding nine assists to lead
the.Western Pennsylvania Confer-
ence in that category.

As a freshman, Karl saw more
playing time than any other Panther
besides senior captain Tom Mur-
phy, playing the sweeper position.
Being the last man between the
opposition and the goalie, the
sweeper is, along with the goalie,
the last line of defense and the
director of the defensive unit.

The Nigh brothers play soccer
From

September to November, collegiate
ball is in season, and immediately
following are senior leagues (18 and
over), National Challenge Cup,
World Cup games and summer
leagues.

“We come from a very close
family,” said Karl. “We always do
everything together, practice, play
on the same teams and work
together in the summer. We each
consider the other toibe our best
friend.”

Besides participating in indoor
competition at Pitt, Mark and Karl
are members of a senior league
team in the Lehigh Valley. This
team is coached by Willie Ehrlich,
the same man who will coach the
Pennsylvania Stoners when it
becomes the American Soccer
League’s newest pro team in June

Pantherettes Win First‘

The Pantherette swim team

by defeating West Virginia Uni-

All-America Kathy Stetler fin-
ished first in three events, setting a
pool record in the 100-yard
butterﬂy with a time of 58.59
seconds. Stetler placed ﬁrst in the
50-yard butterflv (26.74) and in the

With the loss of only 2 seniors and
