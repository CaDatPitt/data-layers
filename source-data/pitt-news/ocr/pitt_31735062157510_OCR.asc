ANOTHER SIGN OF NORMALCY

Things are getting back to normal, all right.
Last Saturday the Pitt football team scored an upset over

Piirdue and yesterday there wasn’t even a hint of an attempt’

to stir up a victory rally. That_’s just as it should be.

It was getting to the point where everyone regarded a
Panther win as nothing short of a miracle. The attitude was a
natural outgrowth of the past few seasons -where grid victories
have been few, far between, and of little signiﬁcance.

But things have changed this year. We have a team that
has demonstrated its ability to win consistantly- In fact, they are
now assured of. compiling the best record of any Pitt team
since 1941.

We’re not opposed to victory rallies as’ such. It’s just that
there is inherent in such gatherings the notion. that the team
accomplished something totally beyond its powers—somet.hing

. it really didn’t have the ‘ability to do. ‘-

There you probably have the reason for the absence of
feeling for a rally yesterday. Even we students are beginning
'to realize that" the team is good.

OUORSERROR, OR‘ is IT?

In an editorial in’ last Friday’s news we picked up a con-
fused bonﬁre 1‘-ally situation andpassed it on, confusion and all,
to- you. Now we’d like to clear up some of the confusion and
give you what seems to be the real story. ‘

Last Friday we said that the bonﬁre ‘rally scheduled for

.Thursday night was so scheduled because the deans refused to

give permission for a classes-dismissed pep rally during the
day time. . . , I

It now develops that the deans were never asked to dis-
miss classes.‘ Such class dismissals are contingent upon the spon-

 soring body, in this case Student Congress, obtaining an alter-

  
   

.EDITOR 

News:

~Finley,

 

:om'ce Staff: Elaine-‘.Martin. same," Harrold,-'

nate indoor location capable of seating 1000 persons should
weather ‘prevent the rally from being held outdoors.
Student Congress made no such preparations. And, feeling
that under the circumstances its request would be refused,
Congress did not petition the deans for a Friday morning class
dismissal. ‘
So much forthe correction of the facts. Our stand on the

‘matter is still the same. In our opinion an evening bonﬁre

rally, particularly one held‘ on Thursday night, is a mistake.
VVhether the responsibility rests with deans, as we ﬁrst re-
ported, or whether, as it now appears, it belongs to Student
Congress, makes no difference. It doesn’t alter the fact that the
time isinconvenient and makes it virtually impossible for a
large percentage of the students to attend. ‘

Furthermore there’ll be no band. That further damages the
chances for a successful rally. Once again, it appears that that
is Student C0ngress’s doing. They felt that the rally could
succeed with just the bonﬁre, the cheerleaders, a11d the students.

We’d like to believe that Congress is right. But past ex-
perience shows differently. The two night rallies held in re-
cent years have both been miserable failures. .\Ve’ll concede
that the bonﬁre rally last year could have been a succses but
for the failure of the public address system, but, on the other
hand that rally was on a Friday night.‘ VVe doubt if they will
on Thursday; , ~

For once we hope we’re wrong. Not particularly for the
sake of Student Congress, but for the team. They’ve played well
this year and deserve a boost. Let’s hope that in spite of bad
planning they get it. ' ‘

LeH'ers to
The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News?

I cannot attest to the quantity
and quality of scholars in our
grand institution, but I can say
that we are apparently well_-
stocked in grade A hypocrites.

Something smells when it takes
only four seconds to four minutes
to persuade a student to laude our
team for a great victory by tak-
ing a sweet little vacation from
his scholarly pursuits, and yet
four days isn’t sufﬁcient notice to
tear him from his feverish home-
work—doing fo_r an hour to help
bolster the boys’ morale, after a
crushing defeat, by seeing them
off to an away game.

The fact that our team_ beat
Purdue on Saturday in spite of,
and not because of, us c_an best
be illustrated by a remark made
by one of the players as he looked
over the crowd of eighteen well-
wishers, who turned out on Thurs-
day night, and quipped, “Well I
hope it’s a pleasant trip, any-
way.’ "That the team went onto
win shows that they’re well’ con-
ditioned by now to the "ﬁckle ways
of their erratic ‘supporters and
don’t let events like Thursday
night bother them too much.

Where were the cheer leaders?
Where were the missing eleven
members of Student Congress,
which had sponsored the rally?
Where, even, were the 50 or 60
paranoids who had insisted on a
holiday after the West Virginia
farce. And where were the three
thousand students who cheered
themselves hoarse at Soldier’s and
Sailor’s Memorial after. the great
Indiana victory? _

If this is really indicative of the
kind ‘of support we offer our
team—-dynamic in victory but
lethargic in defeat——I say we don’t
any more deserve a revised ath-
-letic policy with all the trim-
mings than does the stranger de-
serve an answer when he asks,
pointing-to the Cathedral, “What
big building is that,‘ sonny?”

Transporfafion -Needed

It seems there is a concentr§-
tion on the wants" and needs of
the student body lately. Since The
Pitt News has been instrumental
in bringing about many beneﬁts
for the students, I would like to
make a suggestion:

Why not have a special section

of the bulletin board'devoted to,

transportation opportunities? Here
automobile drivers, going home on
certain weekends and holidays,
who are willing to have students
share expenses in return for a
ride, could indicate where and
when they are going. '

This would bebeneﬁcial not on-
ly to the rider, but to the driver
as well. This plan is now in suc-
cessful operation at a number of
colleges and universities.

Why don’t we give it a try here
at Pitt? P. F. Smith.

Chancellor Extraordinaire

By PAT SEGER.

.Head man of this University might easily be named Chah-U

cellor Extraordinaire. Even then the naming would be inade-

quate, for it falls short of the truth. Chancellor Rufus H. Fitz-—;

gerald is much more than Chancellor Extraordinaire. . ‘

 

He ’s the man who invited 1400 parents of freshmen

dents to the University last Friday. And the guestshad su'eh,;
a good time, and found the hospitality of the Chancellor and.

the University family so warm, they were reluctant to -1ea.y{:e.'
The University family, of course, mer_ely reﬂectts the person‘ 'i
ty and feeling of its head man. “ 
' The Chancellor is a friendly man. And students shoul‘
feel that way toward  Some time ago, the Chancello
spoke to a group of senior "mentors and »upperc_lass coun‘
sellors. At one point of the conversation, he expresse’
concern over the friendly spirit of the student, body.‘-
, seems that in his daily jaunts to the Tuck Shop for a-.cu_
of coffee, Chancellor Fitzgerald meets and greets man.
‘students en route; Sorry, the Chancellor can ’t- say as nine
. for many of the studentswho walk by him. "with, head
almost deliberately turnedin an opposite direction. 
It was at this-point in the conversation that Chancell‘o
Fitzgerald expressed worry over -the fact that students do
seem too friendly sometimes. Students should u'ndersta.nd"~tli
formal introductions are not in order; most students‘ know
Chancellor to see, and when they "see "him in the hal1s,,a-‘sh

Even during these days of much concern-‘over thejbuild

Mentor Phase
Ends Friday For
Frosh Coeds

Stepping up a rung, Freshmen
coeds move into the. Guild period
Friday at the Guild Assembly,
slated for Foster Memorial at 3:30

p. m.
Known as the formal end of
Mentor Period, this assembly

marks the‘ ﬁrst time frosh coeds
participate in some activity other
than those scheduled for them by
the Customs committee.

Program for the afternoon in-
cludes an oral thank—you to men-
tors from a freshman woman, and
another thank—you from a mentor
to freshmen.

Guild Assignments Ready

Martha Duffy, chairman of the
Customs Committee will formally
close the customs period for the
class of 1952. Beginning with the
green armband ceremony early in
freshman week, the customs pro-
gram aided fall entrants for eight
weeks.

. Guild Chairman Barbara Wolff
will keynote the program with a
talk introducing the coeds to the
Guild program of WSGA. Follow-
ing this, brochures listing the re-
spective guild assignments for
each freshman woman will be
distributed. '

The Guild Chairman reminds
guild applicants that all preferen-
tial choices were considered be-
fore ﬁnal assignments were made.
Correlating free hours of appli-

assignments which are other than
ﬁrst choices, Miss Wolff observes.

tend the assembly Friday may call

importance. Each guild is. pre-
sided over by a representative of

‘that guild’s parent activity.

Disabled Vets
Get Increases
In Subsistance

Veterans who are receiving war
- incurred disability of 60 or more
percent and who have dependents
are entitled to increased beneﬁts
under Public Law 8'77.  ‘

According to the Veterans Ad-
.ministration, this law went into
effect Sept. 1, 1948. Men who are
eligible should submit their evi-
dence by Dec. 1, to get full bene-
ﬁts.

Veterans who are receiving pay-
ments under another law adminis-
tered by the Veterans Administra-
tion, such as Public Law 16, are
not eligible under the new law.
However, a disabled veteran may
choose the law which provides the
most compensation.

The new law provides for the
following monthly increase for
veterans who receive 100 percent
disability:

1. Has wife but no child--$21.

2. Has a wife and one living
. child——$35.

3. Has a wife and two children
living—$45.50.

4. Has wife and three children
1iving——$56. '

5. Has no wife but one child

' living——$14. ,
 6. Has no wife but two living

- children—$24.50. _
I 7. Has no wife but three living

I children——$35. -

8.. Has dependent mother or
father—$17.5-0 for each dependent.
For those veterans who receive
less than 100 but more than 60
percent disability, the above rates
are directly proportionate to the

T" .percentage of disability.

  

Peacetime veterans will receive
20 percent less than those with
war incurred disability.

Debate Team Shows Promise
In Western Reserve Series

Although the recent Pitt debaters meet was merely an exhibi-
tion, according to shift-of-opinion ballots passed throughout the aud-
iences the team returned home with the satisfaction of an edge over
Western Reserve. ‘

William Karasko, team manager, Robert Dickey, and Harry
Green took the afﬁrmative side of the question for the Pitt team
which was: “Resolved: That the UN should now be revised into a
World Federal Government.”- '

Smoker Slated
For EE Frat

Eta Kappa Nu, honorary elec-
trical engineering fraternity, will
hold a smoker this evening at 8
p. m. in the social room of the
Foster Memorial.

Purpose of the smoker is to
acquaint new pledges with active
members. Movies of the 1948
Olympics will be shown.

/ .

The fraternity has also an‘-
nounced that it will hold its an-
nual initiation banquet at athe
Faculty Club, 17th ﬂoor Cl, on
Dec. 2 at 5:30 p. m. ’

Melvin McLeod, president of the
fraternity, has appointed Edward
Rent and Frank Formosa to head
the committee in charge of the at-
fair.

James M. Wallace, head of the
switch and gear division of West-
inghouse, will be initiated.

The Pitt team contended that
the present UN power is insecure.
They stated that if Russia were to
attack us today, the U.S. would
have no assurance that our allies
would go along with us. Because,
for example, Germany who had
made an non-aggression pact with
Russia in’ 1940, attacked her six
months later.

Also, with a FWG, all arma-
ments of the nations belonging.
would be controlled by one cen-
traliauthority, the Pitt team main-
tained.

Western Reserve, taking the
negative side of the question, stat-
ed that Russia would not join the
FWG if it were established be-
cause they had already vetoed
the Baruch Plan for Atomic En-
ergy Control. The Baruch Plan
was in itself a form of federal
government on a limited scale.

Frank Gold, Reserve debater,
said, “Russia used the veto in the
UN for the protection of her own
interests.”

The teams debated before eight
diﬁerent high schools throughout
Northesatern Ohio. Approximate-
ly 4000 students attended the’ de-
bates. .

Robert Dickey, publicity direc-
tor for the Pitt team, stated that
the University debaters wiwll be
a powerful factor in the National
Intercollegiate Debates this year.

Mt. Mercy will meet the Pitt
team on Nov. 17 in a Novice tour-
ney.

Aroused Panthers May Mar
Lions‘ Undefeated Record

By BOB VAN ATTA

Every autumn aboutithis time, Penn State’s football Lions
roar out of State College, down Mt. Nittany, over Bald Eagle
Ridge, and across Western Pennsylvania to the once-smoky

metropolis of Pittsburgh.

The object of State’siundefeatged footballers is a trio of,

‘ ‘ seconds.” . -

In Saturday afternoon ’s annual stadium battle between the
Panthers and Lions, Bob Higgins’ invaders will be seeking their

second straight victory over Pitt, their second consecutive un-'

beaten season, and their second Cotton Bowl bid. «

Nittany’s legions have not lost‘

since their 1946 ﬁnale against
Pitt at the Stadium. Wes Fes-
ler’s Panthers upset the prog-
nosticators with their 14-7 suc-
cess ov_er previously once-beaten
Penn State that year.

Petchell Stars
Followers of the two rivals—-

and State mentor Higgins—are
aware that a properly aroused
Pitt eleven could again spring the
unexpected. This time, the cost
to State would be large.

Cotton Bowl aspirations would

-suffer as well as the 17-game un-

beaten skein. V
. On the optimistic side of the
State College picture is the phe-
nomenal work ‘of halfback El-
wood Petchell, the “Flying Frag-
ment.” Petchell’s passing and will-
of-the-wisp running have been
instrumental in every State game.
State Favored

Abetted by Wally Triplett’s
gains on reverse splays, Fran Ro-
ge1’s bull-like plunges, and
Chuck Drazenovich’s 1 bruising
blocks, the State eleven is an odds-
on favorite to get past Mike Mil-
ligan’s Panthers- "

Such stellar holdovers from last
year’s topﬂight defensive line as
Negley Norton, tackle, J oe‘Drazen-
ovich and John Simon, guards,
Chuck Beatty, center, and Sam

-'Tambu_ro, end, measure up to a

ﬁrst rate forward wall.

In addition to Petchell, Rogel,
Drazenovich, and Triplett, Hig-
gins sports depth and experience
with backs Bill Luther, Larry
Cooney, Captain and punter Joe
Colone, and sophomore sensation
Vince O’Bara, a younger brother
of Pitt’s Joe. *

State has decisively beaten
Bucknell, 35-0; Syracuse, 34-14;
*West Virginia, 37-7; Colgate, 32-’
12; and Temple, 47-0; and tie

Michigan state, 14-14. S

Frosh Squad
Has Kickers

Both ends on the ﬁrst-string
line of Pitt’s freshman "football
squad have something in com-
mon. ' ‘

Ends Chris Warriner of Taren-
tum and Paul Chess of Meadville
used their feet for something be-
sides support during their hig
school football careers. *

Warriner did most of the punt-
ing for Tarentum, while Chess
.. kicked e x t r a
p oi n t s
Preston Ditty’s
M e a d v il l e

team.
In his ﬁrst
year on t h e

en, the latter
athlete played
at end. The
following sea-
son, he switch-

 

Warriner ed to quarter-
back and then moved to, half-
back. V

Frosh coach Ted Schmitt has
completed the cyc-le by returning
Paul to a terminal spot.

A_fter_ the 1946 and 1947 cam-
paigns, the 6-foot, 180 pound grid-
der rated honorable mentions on
the All-WPIAL Class A selections.

‘He recalls the 1947 contest with
Sharon as, his most eventful high
school game. In the tilt, which

ended in a 20-20 tie, the blond_
‘scored "one

Meadville halfback
touchdown and kicked an extra-
point. .

Other sports in which the 18-
year-old freshman competed in-
clude track and basketball.

As a member of the track squad,
he entered high.-jump, shot—put,
and broad-jump events. On the
basketball team, -he divided two

. years of activity between forward

and center.

ous round of applause from a hightly partisan crowd of 30,000
spectators, chilled ﬁrst by the temperature which hovered in

A
V

Garns spotted the losers a ﬁrst
period score before going on to
win. The Delts had -whipped the
Fijis before, 25-O.

Kent Thorpe, speedy Delt.ha1f-
back, took the Phi Gams’ opening
kickoff on his Own ﬁve-yard line
and raced the remaining 75 yards
behind perfect blocking for- a
touchdown. A Bob Hughes-to-Bill
Weber pass added the extra point.

Rally Brings Win

The Delts appeared to -be on
their way to another rout, but the
Phi Gams drove 60 yards -from
the. next kickoff to tally on a 25-
yard aerial from Bill Thompson
to Marty Frame, whose pass catch-
ing throughout the contest was a
big factor.

Late ‘in the ﬁrst period, Rog

Garris intercepted a Delt lateral
on the Delt 5, and two plays lat-
er, Skip Rebele passed to Frame
for a score. Frame also added the
extra point to give the Fijis a
13-7 lead at the quarter. ‘

The second and third periods

were scoreless.

An injury to their ace,- Kent
Thorpe, seemed to rouse the los-
ers vainly ‘as they knotted the
score early in _the fourth period

on a pass from Jim Hawkins to I

Bill Weber. .

With two minutes remaining,
Bob Horner threw a 30 yardpass
to Bill Lyman in the end zone to
put the Phi Gams in front to

stay. .Dean Carey intercepted a '

desperation Delt pass in the ﬁnal
‘minute and ran 40 yards for a
touchdown to ice the game, 25-13.

lM.PIayoffsNear Completion:
Winner To Meet Tech Champ

By the end of this week, the 1948 Pitt intramural touch football

champ should be determined.

As soon as playoffs now in their ﬁnal stages reach completion,

the Pitt IM titleholder will meet

Carnegie Tech’s IM Winner. This

may take place by the middle of next week, Leo C. Bemis, head of

A
T‘

the IM realm here, revealed.

Last December, Pitt’s PiKA six
humbled Tech’s Theta Xi‘ sextet,
19-7, for the Oakland intermural
toga.

From outward appearances, the
Tech representative’ will meet

._,either the Locals or the Phi Gams.

Both are formidable contenders.
Bob Wicks leads the Locals, In-
dependent League winners this
year and runnersup in the ﬁnal

_ last autumn.

Locals Favored

The Locals are rated by some
observers as a slight favorite in
the ﬁnal, with last year’s team
back.

The Greek lads enjoyed the clos-
est race in two years, which fea--

gtured the dethroning of PiKA.

In comparing the relative

strength of the Locals and Phi

Gams, many IM fans have over-
looked a possible dark horse in
the Engineering loop winner,
Resistance Block. ,

Psi Omega, Professional League
top-notcher, has been overlooked
but is still in the race.

Vade Mecum

Lois Hite has been named editor
for the 1949-50 Vade Mecum,
coed’s handbook. She will be as-
sisted by Marilyn Knisely, Brenda
McCauley, Peg Evans and Ginny
Fausler.

A new editorial policy was in-
augurated two years ago. Instead
of having Vade Mecum merely a
collection of articles about the
University, WSGA, etc., the entire
book was integrated with a theme,
last year’s being “The Keystone.”

The new editor says she plans

to continue this policy,'but as yet
hasn’t formulated any deﬁnite idea
of what the theme will be.

The staff for next year’s Vade
Mecum is now being selected so
that" work on the handbook will
not have to be done during the
summer.
