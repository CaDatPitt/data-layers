Papal Idea

_An exhibition designed to il- _

luminate the spirit of the papal

encyclical Peaceon Earth (Pacem
“ in Terris) by means of more than
100 photographs and textual ex-
cerpts is located in the SU Mar-

view through July 25.

The unique papal document,
which the late Pope John XXIII
addressed to“‘all men of good
will” in Easter Week 1963, j’us'-t/
two months before his death, has’
been described by John R‘. Loch,
director of the SU, as “an ediﬁce
ofpeace’? in the atomic age.

It was the first papal. encycli-
7:‘ calever to be addressed beyond

the limits of the Roman Catho-
lic community, and has been
widely accepted as a basic state-
ments of the rights and respon-
sibilities of man in the conduct
of life and the achievement of ‘
peace on earth. .,

Highest Faculty Post,

Clinical Science, newly establish-
ed successor to the department of
the same name.

In making the announcement,
Dr. David H. Kurtzman, acting
chancellor of the University, said,.
“The appointment of Dr. Mirsky
to our highest faculty position re-
ﬂec-ts the University’s regard for
his outstanding contributions to.
clinical research and teag/‘hing.
Through the establishment, of the
Laboratory of Clinical Science
"we seek to eliminate the admin-
istrative encumberances associ-
ated with a departmental chair-
~ manship,. and to provide Dr. Mir-
sky with the optimum environ-
ment for, a successful continua-
tion of his scientiﬁc endeavors.”

Among the 34 professional or-
ganizations in which he holds
membership, Dr. Mirsky includes
the American Association for Ad-
vancement of Science, the Amer-
ican Chemical Society, the Amer-
ican Medical Association, and the
American Psychoanalytic Asso-
ciatlon.

His scientific publications con-

cerning physiological and psy-

, chological problems number over
270.  ' ‘

Pitt Watching and Waiting   
On State] Relation Crisis    

By FRED FRANK

“Watching and Waiting”
will be the University’s Ha.r-
risburg policy for the next
weeks, according to Acting
Chancellor David Kurtzman.
Dr. Kurtzman said that the
earliest he hopes that the Gen-
eral 'Assembly_might P855 State‘
related legislation for the Uni-
versity is the middle of August.

“While the legislators are ap-
preciative of the University’s

problems, the ﬁrst issue for them:

is passage of General Appropria-

'tions. The Republican controlled

State Senate has refused to act
on any non-preferred appropria-
tions (the Pitt bill) until the gen-»
era_1./ appropriations —- for state
operations—areA passed by the
Democratic-controlled House.

In an interview with The Pitt
News Dr. Kurztman answered
these and other questions about
state-related legislation and the
University’s future.

VSEARCH FOR CHANCEL-
LOB: The Chancellor Search Com-
mittee continues to search for a
‘person of “national reknown.”
Dr. Kurtzman stated that mem-
bers of the committee have nar-
rowed down the list of possibil-
ities, but the committee‘is»“not

affair.

DR. DAVID KURTZMAN
State-Relation Discussed

going to ‘settle on next best just
to have a chancel1or.’_’

While the search is on for a
good administrator, _the ability
to “capture the imagination of
the community” is also desired
in the next chancellor.’

At Orientation

Frosh Please Advisors

By BERN! McLEOD

With four orientation ses-
sions down and four to go,
the freshmen Liberal Arts
advisors have had a chance
to meet many of the incom-
ing fall students. On the
whole, they are very pleased
with what they see. '

The advisors, graduate students
from a wide variety of academic
ﬁelds, meet with prospective
freshmen during each three-day
orientation period to help them
schedule fall classes and solve
any particular academic prob-
lems. They remain advisors to
the same group of students for
the next two years.

Bill Hallidy, a Ph.D. candidate

in physics, describes the fresh-‘

men that he has seen as “optimis-
tic, interested and clean-cut. Al-
though I haven’t seen too many
beatniks, or cynics,” he remark-
ed, “it might be interesting to
run into a few.”

“They ask me every question
imaginable,” he continued, “from
-how to get into the choir to any-
thing else entirely divorced from
strict academic advising.’’'

Frank Farmer, a Ph.D. candi-
date in geography, is impressed
with the absence of “duds”
among the students he meets.
“They are all prepared with at
least a tentative fall program.

,Dave Hart should also be com-

mended,”. he remarked, “all the
athletes seem to be pretty good
students.” V

The only criticism that Jim
Marino, a Ph.D. candidate in
English, had to level against the
freshmen.was “they didn’t ask

enough questions.” “We have a
lot of information to offer them,
that I wish I had when I ﬁrst
entered college. We didn’t have
advisors and I needed one.”
This “information” comes from
both the experiences and aca-
demic backgrounds of the advi-
sors as well as from an intensive
two-week training pt-ognam that

. they all attend.

Dave Powers, chairman of the
Liberal Arts Advising Center, in-
structs the advisers in the step-
by-step procedure of registering
students. Representatives from
the Dean of Men’s office, Dean
of Women’s office, student rec-
ords, physical education and the
Medical School also speak to
them about situations affecting
undergraduates. During the two-
weeks they have four tests ,in-
cluding the periodic “test” of ad-
vising Dave Powers who takes
the role of a capricious student.

The advisors generally feel
that they meet students needs.
“The program may not be per-
fect,’.’ says Bill Hallidy, “but
through trial and error we’ll
learn how to make any improve-
ments.”

BOOK DISPLAY_
The problems of immigrants in
America was the subject of 13

‘novels and non-ﬁction books by

Louis Adomic. These books and
a bust of Adomic are on display
in the Darlington Library, 601
Cathedral of Learning.

The bust of Adomic was pre-
sented to the University by Mat-
te Bor, president of the Associa-
tion of Yugoslav Writers. Acting
Chancellor David Kurtzman ac-
cepted the bust.

Acting Chancellor
In recent weeks some students have expressed

/boncern over the direction the University is tak-

ing. The feeling seems to prevail that we h‘ave
abandoned the “big picture” in favor of the ‘lit-
tle picture.”/’ _ ' _

To be sure, Pitt still has‘ its big dreams.‘ We
are still just as interested .171. ational recognition
as we ever were. At this time, we simply need to
take stoclo—making sure we aren’t bending so far
in one direction that we overlook the excellence
existing under our noses. _

I had hoped to clear up any confusion on this

point in my commencement remarks. But students

rarely hang on every word their eh.ancellor puts
forth at commencement. To make matters worse,
the loud speaker didn’t carry the sound to all sec-
tions of that vast lawn. With these things in mind
-I would like to use this column space, so kindly
afforded me by The Pitt News, to reprint_s_ome
excerpts in the hope that will clarify our position.”

“A decade or more ago, in critical self-

. evaluation, this institution found an ur-

gent need to broaden its horizons, to be-
come both national and international in

‘scope, and to move outward from its long-

standing concern for its immediate geo-
graphical home. And so it undertook to ex-
amine" its role in relation to the larger,
world-wide academic community, and it ini-
tiated programs that would make a contri- _
bution to that larger community and bring

- recognition from it. The success of that ef-

fort has been remarkable in the past dec-
ade. I need not remind you of all that has

I ’ — been accomplished. You yourself——students,.

 

 

 
  
 

faculty, Trustees, and friends of the Uni-
versity——have been a part and a product of

I that accomplishment.

“But now, in more recent days, we have
undertaken a reassessment. We have begun
to look at ourselves in terms. of where we
have been, where we are, and where we

plan to go. And perhaps we have begun to '

‘realize that there is much close at home
which we may have overlooked in our/out-
ward ﬂight. The Pittsburgh region has
made enormous strikes in industrial devel-
-onment, in civic progress, and in education
at all levels. Business has taken a new hold
in the region and businessmen are more
optimistic about the future. We are on the

‘verge of what could be the largest urban

redevelopment project in history. Our
schools are pace-setters for urban educa-
‘ior'ial"s“ystems across the country and, I
may ad'd’,"“our school administrators are

' much sought by other urban centers. The

men whom we honor here today are repre-

-sentatives and leaders of this to us, but be-

cause theyvare a source of strength. That

 

     

      
  

July 1»

proach to‘ the larger world of scholarship.

' to discover what the community needs and

  
   

is really the lesson of recent days, a lesson
that we are only beginning to learn: name-
ly, that the local community and, in par-
ticular, the local academic community, as a I
whole, is stronger than the, sum of its parts.

“SO, IN A SENSE, today we embark on
a new era. While we continue to look at the
larger world of affairs, we do look inward,
to examine how our local strength can be
employed to fuller advantage in our ap-

“There is nothing contradictory between
a sense of responsibility to our home-re-
gion and a desire to achieve excellence on
a national scale in education. Many ﬁne ed-
ucational institutions——Michigan, Califor-
nia, to name just two———have shown that it
is possible. An, institution can be both re-
gionally oriented and nationally renowned.
There is no reason why Pittsburgh, given
the will, cannot do the same. I would like
to suggest, therefore, that this be our con-
cern in the days ahead—to develop a re-
gional educational institution of high qual-
ity and national repute—and to do it by
better utilizingthe strengths inherent in
our local community.

“I also would like to suggest some ap-
proaches. I

“WE LOOK to an era of greater cooper-
ation with our sister institutions. Already
we have begun to« explore with them the
possibilities of cooperative undertakings. In
recent months we have joined with ﬁve of
our sister institutions in establishing a
council, which has been meeting regularly,
discussing mutual problems. The spirit of
cooperation is now upon us, and we all have
the highest hopes concerning where this
path will lead. 7

“We must also examine with them how
we can share the work load in higher edu-
cation. Clearly there are’ many things we
can do together which any one of us could
undertake individually. And, conversely,
there many things which we require in com-
mon, and we dissipate our resources by try-
ing to'reproduce them separately.

_“Finally, the ‘University must re-ex-
amin_e its re_sponsibilities to the local com-
munity in light of its own resources and
goals. We must look beyond our own wishes

how those needs should’ be provided. This
does not mean that the University will un-
dertake [programs to solve every commun-
ity problem. ‘But it does mean that we will
be concerned with community problems and

expectations, and that; we will have the

‘Reagan’s Political Acting

Ronald Reagan began mak-
ing grade B movies 20 years
ago and his acting ability
still has not improved. His
latest display of ineffective
acting came before a gather-
ing of newspapermen in
Washington, D. C. Reagan
had just won the Republi-
can gubenatorial nomination

« in California and was begin-

ning to spread “Creative So-
ciety”'campaign propaganda.

Reagan’s intent was to
convince the journalists that

the was not an extreme con-

servative‘ of the Goldwater
or John Birch category. In-
stead of performing his poli-
tical strategy, Reagan’s per-
formance convinced the as-
tute critic that he was in-
deed an extreme conserva-

tive. His criticisms were di-

rected at students and offi-
cials at the University of
California at Berkeley, the
recent liberal rulings of the
Supreme Court, and Negroes
and unemployed people in
California. ,

AFTER s,tating that ‘he
was an‘ ordinary citizen who.
desired to bring the “fresh
air of common sense” to
public issues, Reagan criti-
cized the causes of seeming-
ly unordinary citizens. He
claimed that Berkeley ()ffi-
cials had appeased the “ﬁl-

will to solve those that we
can solve and fulﬁll those
that we can fulﬁll. I
“In sum, we must help de-
ﬁne what the community re-
quires, examine how the
work load, ought to be di-
vided, and cooperate to pro-
vide that which we are cap-
able of providing. Only then
will We have discharged our
responsibility to this region
and,.in the process, enhancecfl
our approach‘ to the world 0
scholarship.” I

thy speech advocates” whose
activities “violate every code’
of ethics and morality and
are too shocking to talk
about.” He followed these
comments by claimi_ng
staunch opposition to any ac-
tivity on campus that inter-
feres with education. Such
statements are not only typ-
ical of the extreme rightist
viewpoint, butare contradic-
tory. .

In his criticism of the Su-

, preme Court, Reagan show-I

ed that his knowledge of
social issues is only as great
as that of his speech writers.
He said the Court was help-
ing spread the philosophy
“that it’s the criminal who
must be protected from so-
ciety, not the other way
around.” In essence, he was
echoing the “Impeach Earl

_ “Warren” cries in more so-

phisticated language.

REAGAN next criticized
that favorite target of the
conservatives —— minority
groups. He claimed many
Negroes and unemployed
persons in Los Angeles found
it “too easy to go back on
the welfare rolls,” instead of
replacing _expelled Mexican
braceros as orange pickers
in California. His comments
were not directedat the so-
cietal factors causing the
plight of the unemployed.
Instead he felt the Negroes,
and unemployed should ac-

tent was to convince the au.
