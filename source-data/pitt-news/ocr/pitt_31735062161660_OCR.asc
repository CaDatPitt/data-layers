OFFICIAL STUDENT 1‘R*-WEEKLY PUBLICATION on THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By RUGY ALDISERT
Returning home one week

Volume XXIX Z653

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA MONDAY, MAY 2, 1933

Number 79

 

ago today, 17 delegatesto the
Intercollegiate Conference on
Government told a story of the
success of the conclave just
held in Harrisburg. V

And -a great occasion the
had to tell about. They told a
story of" attending one of the most
unique events on any student’s
extra-curricular list: where fra-
ternity men were given full Op-
portunity to show off their log-
rolling experience; where debat-
ers had the chance to see what
practical results their oratory
could obtain.

But the delegates could have
told another story. A story show-
ing that compared to leading
schools participating in the con-
ference, the University delegation,
as a whole, was nothing to write
home about.

On Our Side

Of course they would be keep-
ing in mind the following facts:

1. The ICG movement orig-
inated at this University.

2. Its executive director is a
member of the University facul-
ty.

3. A University student was i
the ﬁrst successful student-
chairman, elected by the assem-
bly.

4. Other schools in the con-
ference seem to look up to the
Pitt delegation as an example.

What was wrong with the Pitt
delegation? Well, it isn’t that the
group going to Harrisburg was an
inferior lot, but that the Univer-
sity “has the stuff here but won’t
send it up.”

Too few" students really inter-
ested in the work of the ICG can
afford the luxury of the Harris-
burg trip under the present set-
up. In fact, students most vital-
ly interested in the problems of
current government are, many of
them, on NYA work.

On Other Side

As it stands today, the Univer-
sity contributes $50 to conference
expenses. All of which would pay
the complete bills of four stu-
dents. But fortunately, or maybe
unfortunately, more than four are
interested.

Seventeen students went this
year, each receiving 2 dollars to
cover three days of living at the
Penn-Harris, where single beds
are $1.50 a night, and to pay for
such extravagences as three meals
a day.

It is strange then that Univer-
sity delegates have to shoulder all
of their expenses. Especially
when schools like Slippery Rock,
Theil, California, and Shippens-
burg, can send as many as 20 del-
egates, trained by the faculty of
the school, with expenses paid.

Temple Takes Lead

’Or take a large school, one like
Temple. This Philadelphia uni-
versity sponsored special weekly
courses for prospective delegates,
taught by the faculty. The 26
best qualiﬁed at the end of the
course were delegates to the con-
ference with full expenses paid.‘

Besides their own expenses, in
order to further Philadelphia in-

lems, they sponsored three repre-

Pennsylvania. We cannot even

On the other hand it may be the

dents are not interested in what
happens in state government. If
that is true, why have education?
Is not one of the aims of educa-
tion to teach people how to govern

themselves better?

Research Bureau Announces
Further Decrease In Business ,

Business activity in the Pitts-¢

A burgh district registered_a further

decrease in the week ended April
23, according to the Bureau of
Business Research.

The Bureau’s weekly’ index fell
from 65.2 per cent of the 1923-25
average in the week ending April
16, to 63.8 last week. This point
represents a new low in the cur-
rent depression, and the index now
has receded to the level‘ of Decem-
ber, 1934. This time last year the
mark stood at 118.7. . A V

ACCOUNT FOR DECREASE

Last week’s loss was accounted
for by sizable decreases in indus-
trial production and shipments.
In trade--there was a greater-than-
seasonal gain._ Only three of the
14' series which go to make up the
weekly index recorded increases

8 ‘last week.‘ These were depart‘n'ient'

store sales, street railway andibus
trafﬁc, and carloadings of iron and

. steel.

Iron and steel operations for the

week fell more than the decline
usual at this time of year, although
activity was maintained in sheet
and strip production. A consid-
erable restriction of‘ production
schedules was made in the dis-
trict’s pipe mills.
COAL SLUMPS

Bituminous coal production and
river‘ trafﬁc slumped more than
any other important line of activ-
ity. The seasonally adjusted coal
index fell nearly 10 per cent as a
result of restriction of both do-
mestic and industrial markets.
Decrease last week was greater
than the increase in the preced-
ing week.

‘Department store sales were
seven per cent lower in the four
weeks ended last Saturday than

'in"thefour"weeks» ended April 24

a year ago; for the comparable
periods new motor cars registra-
tions showed a decline of 65 per
cent.

A Note On
Commencement

T IS OUR belief that graduating seniors

should have something to say about the
speaker to appear at their Commencement‘.

To our knowledge, in the past they have
never been consulted on who should make this
ﬁnal University address for them.

And so, the seniors listen to a hand-picked
orator with complete apathy. The speaker
ordinarily will make the usual speech which
follows this formula (a) Coi1grat.iilations (b)
W'hat you will have to face in the world. be-
yond (c) 'What you, as college graduates must
offer the world beyond (d) Now go out and do
it . . .

Our suggestion is that in selecting a speaker,
we get a man who has done something, who
will say something beyond the usual formula.

Who would we suggest? ‘Well, there is John
Dewey, of Columbia, great educator and philo-
sopher. There is John L. Lewis, foremost l.abor
leader in America today. There is Maury
Maverick, fast-talking. effective and liberal
Texas congressman. There is J. \Varren Mad-
den, a former professor here, now at the head
of the National Labor Relations Board, an
agency which has done wonders in the labor re-
lations ﬁeld, under an enlightened policy.

There are numerous enlightened men whom
graduating seniors would enjoy hearing. \Ve
repeat, it is our feeling that the Commence-
ment speaker should not be hand-picked from
among lesser educational lights who have noth-
ing new to offer. _

And if it is at all possible, we should like to
see the seniors have a voice in choosing him.——

Labor Shows

Overconﬁdence

HE STEEL VVorker’s Organizing Coniinit-

tee (SVVOC), baby of the CIO, took a ter-
riﬁc shellacking in an election conducted by
the National Labor Relations Board last week.

Taking place at the American Rolling Mill
Co. (ARMCO) plant at Butler, the election was
SVVOC’s first real test in ‘collective bargaining
in the steel industry, since the Jones and
Laughlin victory early in 1937.

Final results as tabulated by the National
Labor Relations Board agents was 1443 votes
against unionization, 402 for, a margin of about
3% to one.

Everything about the election  favorable
to the union. Only one union was placed on
the ballot, and the ballot was a simple yes and
no question, a situation always favorable to a
union. The union, not the company asked for
the vote; the SVVOC asked for certiﬁcation be-

 

- cause they said they had a majority of plant

workers enrolled in the union. The election
was handled in the usual efﬁcient, fair manner
of. NLRB collective’ bargaining elections.

And still, S\VOC took a beating. \Vhy?

It seems to us that SWOC is pursuing, and
for the past several months has been pursuing,
entirely the wrong tactics. They are overcon-
ﬁdent; "‘l?,ll€‘.}' have completely ‘lost their per-
spective. They were so sure of themselves in
the ARl\ICO election that they actually asked
NLRB to conduct the election inside the plant,
something which is almost invariably fatal due
to worker psychology.

It is. the SVVOC contention, too, that if an

election were tobe held today at the Wleirton.

Steel companies’ plants, SVVOC would win

every lab_oi*'economist' that if that election were

SVVOC, it appears to us, has its head up in
the clouds. It is barely possible that the
AR.MCO‘,election will be a good thing for the
union. They may begin to take a realistic view
of the situation. They must realize that Amer-
ican public opinion today, is unfortunately,
anti-union‘, and that union tactics must be
changed enough to realize this situation.

In‘ worker education, too, S‘NOC has failed.
The ARMCO election was strictly what/is com-
monly known as a “bread and butter” vote;
that is to ‘say, company coercion, taking "the
form of “we'll have to close the plant if the
union wins" was effective, but should not have
been so, and might not have been so if the
workers had been properly educated to their

Analyst Sagerson
Predicts Future

By Bill Colker

For years. a man who prefers to be known only
as “Sagerson", has been forecasting futures‘.

iCh.-ia.i*act’e_r's give forth a, spiritual essence that
seem to tell him of their destiny. As he describes
it, it is a sort of entering without knocking at the
door of the subconscious.

Sagerson believes that anyone canydo what he
has don’-e provided they possess sincere, sympathy.

This state. called the occult, is'dire'ctly_ at the back.

fofthe’ obvious. iThe outer material hulk may be

penetrated by sympathy and the real individual
reached and directed.

“The ﬁrst requirement is to know yourself. Most
people are total strangers to themselves and yet
they ought to understand their own impulses. This
is not conceit or selﬁshness. One must be recon-
ciled and companionable to one’s own motives and
reactions, for nothing can separate you from your
own personality.

Advised Actors, Actresses

“It is for the development of these ‘great, un-
tried capacities’ that I try to help people. I have
discovered I can tell peoplepof their hidden capa-
bilities and weaknesses and thus guide ‘them ‘to
their ultimate success.” ' L if T

stage and screen, 7 are people Vvliose, patihs crossed.
that of Sagerson and whom he enciouraged to step,’
ahead. A A 0

Warner Baxter, a discouraged young actor, got
on the same elevator in a hotel in iwiashington, D.
C., with Sagerson one night. He had," been in a
show called “Mom” which had just closed after a
brief run.

Sagerson spoke to him and insisted that he go to
Hollywood instead of trying Broadway again. War-
ner Baxter was too discouraged to take heart at the
predictions of Sagerson. But the character analyst
made the sales talk so convincing that the actor
turned to the screen—-and fame.

Maxine Elliot, Edwin Ca‘-.‘ewe, Ian Keith, Elsie
Janis, Katharine Cornell, Joseph Schildkraut and

, Lenore Ulric are some of the stage people to whom

he offered advice and predictions of stardom.

“It was here in Pittsburgh that I first met Lenore
Ulric,” Sagerson mused. “I was then director of a
play at the Lyceum Theater. She came to the the-
ater one afternoon and asked if she might see the
show, explaining she was a member of another com-
pany, then in Pittsburgh.

“When she thanked me at the end of the show, it
came to me suddenly that this girl would some day
be a personality in show business. She laughed
when I told her, because she was then in a minor
part with Nora Bayes’ “Little Miss Fixit.” But I
was right, and 17 months later my words came
true.”

Men Are Idealists

Sagerson has made some interesting observa-
tions, from his many character readings and close
study of women and men, as to the differences be-
tween the sexes.

Man is an idealist, he says, while woman is a
realist. Women aid the progress in the world.
Men are satisﬁed with three squares a day and :1
bed to sleep on. Women must have more. It is
their little nagging qualities in their eﬁorts to get
more that make men more- progressive.

Men never lose their childlike qualities. Women
never have them. Men are more sincere than
women. Women depend upon little tricks, upon
things which are not themselves, while men as a
rule are more natural.

The money that has eluded him hasn’t bothered
him. Gentle and unassuming and with a serenity
of expression that bespeaks contentment, this inter-
preter of human destinies who prefers to be called
just Sagerson by his friends “watches the race of
men go by.”

Writer Says Coalition
Will KeepUnited Front

This questidn confronts “leaders of the powerful Independ-
ent-Dental—Fraternity coalition today, now that their pre-elec-

Ayers

g resulted in a smashing 27-3

victory for their Student-Faculty¢
Association candidates at the polls
last Friday.
First, test of the unity of the
Coalition which swept all? but three
members of its ﬁve , slates ‘into of-
ﬁctfe comes at the first meeting of
the new SFA Assembly, on Tues-
day, May 10, when the President
/and members of the Executive
Committee will be elected.
Unless an almost unbelievable
political revolution occurs before
that date, the six Coalition mem-
bers who have been privately
slated for the Executive Commit-
tee will. be electedwithout opposi-
tion. And certainly the Coalition
candidate for President cannot be
defeated unless the impossible oc-
curs. ‘
HONOR-—-NECESSITY—BOUND

Bound together by pre-election
agreements, the 27 Coalition mem-
bers who have been elected to
SFA will be certain to vote for the
organization candidates for Execu-
tive Committee and President,
unless they wish to commit poli-
tical suicide.

And no Coalition member has
anything to gain by joining the
three lonely Independent-Inde-
pendents in SFA. '

Election of SFA’s President will
be conducted this year under the
new procedure which allows the
entire Assembly to vote. In for-
mer years, only the six students
and three faculty members of the
Executive Committee made the
choice of President. The change
was made last December by
amendment of the SFA Constitu-
tion.

Story behind the change is that
every time the voting for Presi-
dent took place, the student mem-
bers of the Executive Committee
were split into rival groups, leav-
ing the three administration mem-
bers, Deans Lanfear, Amos, and
Assistant Biddle with the balance
of power. This situation meant
that the administration in reality
selected the SFA President.

CAN’T HAPPEN AGAIN

But that can’t happen again.
This year, the President, who must
be a member of the Executive
Committee, will be elected by the
entire Assembly. Under the pres-
ent set-up, the Coalition man,
whose name will be revealed later,
is a certain winner.

Of the Coalition members who
were electedfto SFA, 16 represent-
ed elements of the old Fraternity
party, winners of last year’s elec-
tion by a close margin. The other
11 Coalitionersare Independents,
Dents, and women who belong to
fraternities which were parts of
the old Independent party. Three
Independent-Independents and ten
Faculty members complete the As-
iembly roster.

Thus, even if a split in the Coali-
tion shculd occur, some faculty
votes must be swung by the in-
surgents in order to elect the SFA
President. But it may be predict-
ed with safety that the Coalition
won’t split for the election of Ex-
ecutive Committeemen and Presi-
dent. For reasons best known to
Coalition insiders, promises of po-
litical plums may be translated
into votes. .

And Coalition leaders Al Barr,
Les Hamburg, and Ernie Rose are

Minute
Interviews

By Messeroff and Akselrad

We’re going to fool Dick Klemer,
C30. Dick says that interviewers
never put in anything that’s true
about the fellow they interview,‘
but we’re going to turn the tables
and put in everything that Dick
said, did, and didn’t.

“Flatbush,” as he’s called be-
cause he comes from the Flatbush
part of Brooklyn, is an “all Amer-
ican something or other.” He’s
not a football player, but he did
once play football; he’s not an
artist, but he’s painting aipicture
of a certain young Pitt Players
Miss.

Dick talks slowly, deliberately,
and let’s every word sink in. They
gave him six lines for the show
“Accent on Youth,” and Dick is
as proud of those six lines almost
as he is proud of Brooklyn.

“Flatbush” learned about wo-
men in Wooster college, Wooster,
Ohio. He worked in the lunch-
room of the girls’ dormitory there,
and “Flatbush” thinks girls are
fussy, but much better mannered
than the fellows. He was conﬁ-
dent, while working there, that
he’d never get a roll thrown in his
eye, or a dish broken over his
head.

This interview should take a
minute, but as we said before,
Dick Klemer can talk. He wants
to be a radio announcer someday
in the future. To prove he’s all
around, “Flatbush” takes care of
two boys’ c1ubs—Peabody I-Ii-Y,
and Forest Hills Panthers.

Before he left, Dick came out
with the outrageous statement that
the Brooklyn Dodgers will win
the National League.

Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

Franklin Field, Phila.delphia—When you are pointing out
things of pride on Pitt’s Frick Acred campus, please remem-

ber that Pitt has a track team.
000 people on the University of

And there’ were more than 40,-
Pennsylva.n1a’s study and play

grounds these past two days wh.o realize that when you have a
track team such as Carl Olson has, you really have soniething.
If vou want, in addition to that chest-ﬁlling sensation, the

thrill nostalgia, there is also Pitt’s¢

track team for appeasement.

It may seem somewhat askew to
recommend to thrill-seekers a
sport that most of the villagers
in Smogville suspect has as many
pulsating moments as the Daught-
ers of the American Revolution
have liberal members. But, after
sitting in this allegedly—fraternal
city, and watching the week-end’s
track and ﬁeld events, I am con-
vinced that this Pittsburgh atti-
tude towar s track i.s nothing but
a giant provincialism.

There is no greater thrill than
watching the boys from back home
come out and show the world how
to come out in front, and do it in
a track meet. This supplied the
background for the thrills we had
in Philadelphia.

It ﬁrst came Friday afternoon
when Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara, Dick
Mason, and Johnny Woodruff, won
the sprint medley championship.
In speaking about this race the
Thursday night before at dinner,
Frank Ohl said, “All we want to
do is to be sure that we get that
baton to Johnny.”

MASON GOES AHEAD

Well, Frank started that race,
running the ﬁrst leg, which was
440-yards. He had to run against
Jim Herbert of NYU and in ad-
«dition was slowed somewhat in
starting. Anyway, he ﬁnished
‘among the ﬁrst five in a ﬁeld that
'was overloaded with entries.

Al Ferrara grabbed the stick
from him and clung to that ﬁfth
‘position in his leg, a 220-yard af-
fair. Captain Dick Mason was
‘waiting for Al and, in spite of the
fact that in the short 220—yard
sprint it is extremely difficult to
gain any ground, Mason passed
two men.

Johnny was still behind two
men when he started to run, but
when he ﬁnished his half-mile leg
«of the medley, there was ﬁve yards
between he and Borck of Manhat-
tan. Johnny’s time for his re-
lay part was 1.49.9, three-tenths
of a second away from the world
mark for that distance.

Perhaps the other apex of ex-
citement during the meet came in
the next to last event in the Car-
nival. It was the one mile relay,
and being that the mile seems to

strike the American fancy it is the
featured event of every track
meet. So it was that the mile re-
lay was the] event over which
most newspaper speculation was
involved. It seemed that the New
York writers couldn’t quite decide
who should be made the favorite.
There appeared to be little to
choose from, to them, between
NYU and Ohio State. ,

Being so much the feature, it
became the event which the Pan-
thers seemed to have their hearts
on. But, after the sprint medley
championship, anyone would have
agreed that that was enough titles
for any team.

WINNING DOUBTFUL

Particularly, after the same boys I
went out and won the half-mile,’
affair, in which each of them aver- I
age of 21.6] for 220-yards, the
chance of winning seemed to dim.
First of all, Ohl, leadoff man, had
run two 220’s and taken twelve
broad jumps, and he certainly had
been deprived of some energy in
this action. And then, three pla-
ques would be too much of a grand
slam to be true.

There also developed the feel-
ing among the other teams that
the team to beat was Pitt. The
attitude became. “Get Pitt.” Thus,
when Ohl, straightened up into a
running position after his crouch-
ing start, an elbow smacked him
in the Adam’s apple, sending a
sharp pain right] down to his
stomach. A few more elbows
blocked his path and coming out
of the ﬁrst turn he fell into the
nestto last position.

‘His ﬁght didn’t give out. With
a sudden accleration he battered
his way up the track and as he
started the second bend, he started
passing. He went by at least three
men. But, they put the box on
second man, Ferrara, too. He still
passed one more man.

Then came McKee. Before the
race, Olson] said to the team,
“Let’s win a watch for McKee.”
The others had already won two.
Instead of doing this, McKee won
the watch himself. He ran his
quarter in 48.6 and handed the ba-
ton to Johnny three yards ahead
of the field. Johnny loped in.

It was all guts that won. It was
all thrills watching it.

Sweep Penn Relays

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports ‘Editor

Franklin Field, Philadelphia
~—After as convincing an exhi-
bition of team running as the
Penn Relays has seen in con-
temporary years, the Pitt
'stick-carriers will bring back
enough in the way of plaques to
mural the Commons Room.

Nudging its. way in among the
-Cloisters that traditionalize the
Penn Relays, the University of
Pittsburgh, virtually an upstart in
track and ﬁeld, earned per-
manency in the] history of this
Carnival and a position of prestige
among the ranking collegiate
teams of the nation by winning.
three relay championships in yes- ]
terday and today’s competition.

Running before more people in
one afternoon than have attended

the Pitt dual meets in Pittsburgh
in the lastgten years, a crowd ofi
approximately 40,000, the Pitt]
mile relay team ran into the tape]
well ahead of Ohio State and‘,
New York University to win]
watches and a plaque for the third
time in the 44th annual running
of‘ these games.

Late Friday, the Pitt quint
medley team of Frank Ohl, Al Fer-
rara, Dick Mason, and Johnny
Woodfuff smattered records into
the cinders as it won the event
in the time of 3224.5, bettering the
record making time that had won
for Pitt the preoeeding year by
almost two seconds.

Early Saturday morning, the
same foursome, each running a‘
220—yard leg, equalled the Penn
Relay riiark "of 1.26.6, as anchor
man Johnny Woodruﬁ easily out-
stro-de Indiana’s, Hick‘ to the fin-
ish line.

‘And then, in one of the feature
events of the two-day program,

best outdoor mile quartets with
the ease of a Woodruff stride.’

‘Play Ball’ Cry Resounols
At Stadium Today As
Campus Baseball Begins

By BILL McELWAIN

Baseball, most popular of all outdoor sports, gets its first tryout
at Pitt today after a long absence when the Olsen Swedes, a Senior
Phys Ed Major team, tangles with the Pre-Dents at 11:00 on the Sta-
dium ﬁeld.

Though the game was originally scheduled between the Swedes
and the Junior Phys Ed Majors, the Juniors notiﬁed Frank Carver
of their inability to play at that time, and the Pre-Dents were sub-
stituted.

The Swedes have a roster studded with former basketball and
football stars, including Frank Patrick, Ted Schmidt, Heinie Adams,
Miles Zelesnick, Ed Spotovich, Joe Garcia, Rags Radvansky, Bomber
Shaw, and others. Patrick is said to be better-than-average at the
diamond sport, having played sandlot ball in Chicago during the past
several summers.

Dents Work On Phys. Eds.

The ﬁrst evening game of the season will be played at the Sta-
dium at 5:00 with the Dents meeting Phys. Ed. Service Team 1. The
Service boys, including such former high school stars as Bill Schil-
decker, Ed Sable, and Sims, will have a fairly strong‘ team. The
Dents, powerful politicians and excellent rooters at football games, are
still an unknown quality as baseball players.

Immediately following the first game, Service Team 2 faces the
Chem Specials. Included in the Chem Special lineup is Rudy Tom-
marelli, captain of the wrestling team.

Tomorrow ﬁnds the Phys. Ed. Sophomores going to bat against
the Phys. Ed. Juniors in the morning game. Both teams, but especi-
ally the Sophs, have men on their squads who were prominent in
other University athletics during the past year.

At 5:00 the Chemistry Seniors scrap with the Engineers, and the
Diables take on the Seals in the second game. The Diables-Seals
Diablos take on the Seals in the second game. The Diablos-Seals
game is the result of a schedule change, the Diablos originally having
the Caputos as their opponents.

One of the most important features of the new season is the ten-
point eligibility code, the text of which follows:

Eligibility Code

. All students carrying normal academic schedules at the Uni-
versity are eligible for competition.

. Players can compete for only one team.

. Teams must consist of at least twelve men.

. Games will start at 5:00 P. M., except when set otherwise in
schedule. .

. Games to be six innings. In case of rain or darkness, four and
one-half innings will count as regulation game.

. When a team cannot play as scheduled, its manager must notify
officials 48 hours before sest time. Failure to show or notify in
advance of inability to show will count as forfeit and drop team
from league.

. Players on dropped team who still wish to play may be registered
to other teams by committee.

. The Pitt News will be the official publication of the league, and
team managers will be responsible for notifying members of any
change in schedule.

. If a student signs up for more than one team, he must remain with

the team for which he ﬁrst plays.

No player can shift from one team to another, unless that team 

disbanded, and then it will be the duty of the committee to assign

10.

Howard Baum’s
Band Will Play
At Hotel Schenley

Thirteen fraternity cups, rang-
ing from ping—pong to basketball
trophies, will be awarded at the
Spring Festival Dance at Hotel
Schenley’s Terrace Garden dining
room, according to Robert L. Cor-
ley, assistant to the dean of men.

The dance, with admission at
$2, will feature a Mardi Gras
ﬂavor with favors suitable to the
carnival decorations. Howdy
Baum, who has been playing for
dancers at the Hotel Schenley for
the past few months, has been
booked for the event.

Setting a precedent in that the
Senior Ball is for the ﬁrst time be-
ing combined with the Festival
Dance, the affair will last four
hours, from 9 to 1 o’clock.

Tickets are on sale and may be
obtained from the following com-
mittee members:

David Grossman, BA38, business
manager; Oscar Goodstein, C38;

Coeds Sponsor
Old-Fashioned
Sports Friday

Chairman Emphasizes
Individual, Not Group
Participation In Races

The faculty may have their
baseball game, the fraternities
may have their sweepstakes, but
the women would rather indulge
in such good old-fashioned sports
as hoop-rolling, roller skating,
scooter racing, and potato rolling
during Spring Festival.

According to Ruth Burry, Ed38,
chairman,, any coed is eligible to
participate in the races, to be held
Friday. Individual competition
will prevail rather than special
organized groups.

Miss Elizabeth Rearick, assist-
ant professor of physical educa-
tion, will act as head judge; and
Miss Ruth Anderson and Miss
Helen Frentzel, instructors in phy-
sical education, will assist her in
deciding the winners.

Contestants must bring their
own scooters and roller skates. Po-
tatos for the potato race, however,
will be furnished by the Univer-
sity.

Women interested in the races
may sign up on the bulletin board
in the twelfth ﬂoor women’s
lounge and at Trees Gym. All en-
tries should be posted by Friday
evening.

Assisting Miss Burry are Joy
Hartman, C40; Mary Kenngott,
C39; and Lillian Zinsser, C40.

Students Will Celebrate

Spring Festival Weelt

(Continued from Page One)

ager, predicts will be the largest
turnout in band concert history
with a number of solos and several
novelty numbers.

Two events will be featured
Thursday afternoon. One, a base-
ball game, is a new Festival fea-
ture. It is to be played between
a representative team from the in-
tramural league and an all star
faculty team under the direction
of Robert Corley, assistant dean of
men. The umpire will bawl,
“Play ball,’’ at 1:00 o’clock on the
new Stadium diamond. Immedi-
ately after the last “out,” the fun
baton will be passed to the frater-
nity men whose track meet will
provide the action for the re-
mainder of the afternoon. Wal-
lace Hirsch, C41, is chairman of
the meet. _

CARNIVAL NIGHT

“After the gang returns from
supper,” says Jack Goleman, BA40,
chairman of the Thursday evening
carnival, “they will ﬁnd the usual
Carnival Night fun done up in
grander style than ever. Remem-
ber what’s included. Free danc-
ing tolthe nation’s top—notch or-
chestr.as,7{.' a record number of
an fraternity-inde-

tainment, prizes, and plenty of
food.” 

Among the booths will be a
weight guessing establishment
sponsored by Druids, a bingo
stand by the Pitt News, a fortune
teller, a rat race and many others.

Spring Festival Tap Day, ac-

A
cording to the customs of the past

will provide the Friday morning
highlight on the outside steps of
the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial
Hall. Highlight of the ceremonies
will be the coronation of Senior
Queen and the announcement of
the women’s choice for Alma
Mater. The outstanding Senior
man, the Junior Spoon awards and
the tappees to most of the non-
scholastic honorary fraternities
will also be revealed at this time.
Thoma-3 Smith, C39, is general
chairm“ n .
FESTIVAL DANCE

The busiest afternoon will be
Friday p. In. Included on the list
of activities are the annual ROTC
parade, the women’s fraternities’
competitive ﬂoat parade, the wom-
en’s sports events with Ruth Bur-
ry, Ed38 as director, and the men’s
fraternity sweepstakes.

The course for the latter has
been changed this year and is the
toughest of any yet proposed. The
cart drivers will begin their thrill-
ing run at Bouquet and O’Hara
streets, will hustle to Lytton ave-
nue, then up Lytton to Parkman
and from there out to Tennyson
street and back down Tennyson to
Bayard. I A A '

With Howard Baum playing the
music, the Hotel Schenley dining
room and Terrace, the site, Steve
Rooney, chairman, and the price
two dollars, the Spring Festival
dance will for theﬁrst time in his-
tory combine with the Senior Ball
as Friday night’s climax to the
we_ek’s’ activities. . .-

TPA’ s Entertain

Province Delegates

If the TPA’s aren’t up to their
usual pep, whim, and wigor, it’s
because the whole province was
conventioning recently at the
Pitt chapter house. This
meant a reception Friday night,
meetings and meals on Saturday,
topped oh’ by a formal banquet’
that night at Graystone Manor
and followed by dancing at the
house afterwards, and then all
the finishings on Sunday—but
the girls were too tired to go
into detail at that point. We
gathered that everythingz; was
very, very successful.

At the same time, would you
like to hear about next year’s
officers for Theta Phi Alpha?
Mary Louise McClain was elect-
ed prexy, assisted by vice-presi-
dent Mary Jane Gross; secretary
Pat Franklin; treasurer, Mary
Lou Walters; house manager
Dorothy West; historian, Mer-
cedes Shiring; Panhel represen-
tative, Betty Fagan; rushing

ity, Betty Wallace; social chair-
man, Nora Kelly; and corre-
sponding secretary, Rita Smith.

Lambda Chi’s Feast
On Founders’ Day

lHad you been in and about ho-.

on the Lambda .Chi’s banqueting
there that evening.

It seems that April 30 is the
date reserved annually by the fra-
ternity to celebrate its founding at
Boston College. This banquet
never fails to draw a crowd of
alumnis and actives from Pitts-
burgh’s neighborhood.

Perhaps you wondered why
the ZTA’s were blossoming out
