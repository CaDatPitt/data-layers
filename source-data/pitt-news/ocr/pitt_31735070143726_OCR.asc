Pitt has rushed back to the
times of the ancients, with an
event last night introducing inde-

pendent students to the philoso-'

phies of greek week rush.

The greek organizations on
campus were out last night for an
event in the \X/illiam Pitt Union
called _Meet the Greeks. Repre-
sentatives wcre present from the
37 fraternities and sororities of
the Interfraternity Council, the
National Pan—Hellenic Council
and the Par_1—Hellenic Council.

“We want to introduce the new 5

‘students to greek life here at Pitt,”
said Steve Laboon, president of

the IFC. Megan Geary, president 

‘of the Pan—Hellenic Council, said 

that the event is a way for inter— l

ested students to “see what we’re
all about” and “get a taste of each
house” that is represented.

The presidents of the three 
greek governing bodies and rep- 7
resentatives from the Office of 1
Cross Cultural Leadership and ;
Development welcomed all the 
students in the Assembly Room. :

Sen. Barack Obama leads Sen.
John McCain by 3 percent in Penn-
sylvania, according to the latest Quin-
nipiac University poll released today.

According to the poll, Obarna is ’
still up 48 percent to McCain's 45 per— ‘

cent after the two party conventions,

compared to 29 percent to 42 percent -

from an Aug. 26 poll.

The shift is  credited to Mc-
Cain's vice presidential choice, Gov
Sarah Palin -

Clay Richards, assistant directo
of the Quinnipiac University Poll-

 Institute, said he believes the vice
presidential picks inﬂuenced the latest .

numbers, but the impact will only be
temporary.

"There are a lot of unhappy
women and 'Reagan'Dernocrats' who
switched to McCain snictiy because
of this strong, extremely conservative
VP candidate that just happens to be a
woman," he said

But 61 percent said that the vice
president has no ‘effect on who they
vote for, and [as] we all hear their

. stances on the issues, that number will

grow ‘

No cash? Put it on credit!
This sentiment is all too famil-

you go a couple of months past
due, those interest rates com-

being swallowed by debt.”

Now, with the Association’s
recently compiled list of six im-

students may be less inclined to

unwittingly fall into a credit card

deal that could leave them high
and dry  and broke.

Included on the list are annual
fee, annual percentage rate (APR
for short), grace period, cash ad-
vance, credit lirnit and other mis-

A icellaneous fees.

But for the uninformed con-
sumer looking to trade in a wad
of cash for a plastic card, even
these six don’t mean much.

“To be honest, I have -abso-
lutely no idea. I’ve never been
told about anything but the dan-
gers, never what to lookfor in a
credit card,” said Charley Murray,

Before committing, get  

to know your credit Carcl

Credit card, pagel

a credit card—less Pitt freshman.

Katie Fricchione, another freshman,
agreed.

“I’m independent, I’m 18, but I don’t
want to screw up my‘ credit now for down
the line when I’ll want to take out loans for
grad school,” she said. “I’d look for [a cred-
it card] that’d give me good rewards and
interest rates if I couldn’t pay my bill. But
I wouldn’t feel comfortable going [to sign
up] by myself.”

Thankfully, the Association wants to

keep students out of the red, and knowing ‘

what terms to watch for can help.

Let’s start from the beginning.

A credit card’s annual fee is simply a
membership fee paid once a year. Often,
companies offer credit card deals that give
people with good credit histories a card

with no annual fee. As a cash-only student,’

however, you currently have no credit his-
tory, and so an annual fee will likely be in
the cards.

A card’s APR is often the downfall of
the uneducated user, and it can go hand in
hand with a card’s grace period. The APR
decides the interest you’ll pay on your pur-
chases for.a certain length of time, whereas
a grace period is an alldwed free time be-
‘-tween the time of purchase and when said
purchase will be added to your balance.

+App!ications available in 434 WPU

A bit confused? Many students are, but
according to the Association’s Communi-
cation Manager Karen Klugh, the impor-
tance of understanding how your credit
card works cannot be understated.

“The biggest trap that students ﬁnd
themselves in is making impulsive deci-
sions, signing up for spur of the moment
deals based on a giveaway,” said Klugh.
“We suggest that you explore at least three
offers and actually- read all the disclosures
and documentations. Know if there’s an
annual fee, know what the rates are. You
shouldn’t just make a split—second deci-
sion.”

Rounding out the Association’s top six
factors are a card’s cash advance, or know-
ing the interest rate on money borrowed
against your line of credit, and credit limit,
which is simply the total amount of credit
(or money) you can charge on the card.

It’s important to be aware of any other
fees that you may encounterfor exceeding
your credit limit or late payment.

But even knowing what to look for
doesn’t mean that it’s high time to get a
credit card. For many students, a meal plan
and a savings account are enough.

“I think I’m responsible enough, but
the debit card works for me right now,”
said Fricchione.

IFC and asked them questions about their
experiences.

Laboon, who also headed one of the
discussions, asked who had seen the TV
show “Greek.” About 10 of the 12 men he
was talking to raised their hands.

He then proceeded to tell them that that
was a poor representation of greek life. In-
stead he related his Greek experience to the
movie “Revenge of the Nerds,” saying that
his brothers are there to support him, and
they are willing to do a lot for each other.

Laboon also addressed the issue of haz-
ing. He said, “If a person is willing to get
hazed, we don’t want them in our organiza-
tion.” _

He said that the members of IFC be-
lieve that you have to give respect to get it,
and hazing is not only looked down upon,
it’s prohibited.

IFC will continue its formal rush with
four nights of fraternity showcasing in
Nordy’s Place next week.

Four different fraternities will be pres-
ent each night to answer questions and
meet independent men who are interested
in going through the recruitment process.

Students leaving the event at the end
-of the evening were busy looking through
their pamphlets and flyers. Liz Morse, a
sophomore transfer student who lives off
campus, said she came as a way to meet
new people.

"I liked how people were there ready to
talk to you, but it was a little intimidating,”
she said. Morse plans to go through at least
the beginning of the Pan—Hellenic’s recruit-
ment in order to “get a better feel for it.”

Andrew Thompson, a junior, said his

» roundtable session with members of IFC
was “very informative but not intimidating I

 "Bonusgate" moves closer to court

 Activist pushes to end alleged abuse of public funds

Pennsylvania taxpayers footed
 the bill nearly two years ago, when
 several state House Democrats
 allegedly awarded themselves
 more than $1 million in bonuses.
. And taxpayers footed the bill
months ago, when those House
Democrats hired lawyers to de-
fend themselves against the sub-
5 sequent corruption charges ﬁled
by Republican Attorney General
Tom Corbett injuly. As it stands,
House "Democrats have used
a more than $1 million in public
 money for defense purposes, ac-
 cording to the Pittsburgh Post-
 Gazette.
 This corruption scandal,
 known as “Bonusgate,” has gone
 on largely unnoticed for far too

 long.
i But political activist Gene
’ Stilp is determined to stop it.
 Stilp recently asked the Com-
‘ monwealth Court to stop House
5 Democrats from using public
 funds to defend themselves in
 court. Stilp also demanded that
those accused refund the money
they used to taxpayers.

Stilp claimed, according to
the Post-Gazette, that House
Democratic leader Bill DeWeese
has spent at least $1.4 million in
public money to defend his cau-
cus members against Corbett’s
.charges..

Those charged are Rep. Mike

Veon of Beaver County and Rep.
§ Sean Rarnaley also of Beaver
 County.
i In addition, 10 current or for-
 mer Democratic House staffers
 were charged, including Michael
 L. Manzo, former chief of staff
 to DeWeese and Brett W. Cott, a
5 top aide to Veon.

We commend Corbett and
Stilp for their efforts in bringing
those charged to court.

As public money is being
wasted on funding the personal
causes of those charged, Penn-
sylvania is losing money. that

could be used toward bettering;
its infrastructure, its transporta-i

tion systems and more.

The money used was intended
for more pressing initiatives, not
the bonuses and court costs of
our elected officials.

The “Bonusgate” crime probe
has been going on for nearly two
years. But it is likely that many
Pennsylvania residents i haven’t
even heard of it. This is the glar-
ing fault of the news media.

As the government’s watch-
dog, the news media have the
responsibility to inform the pub-
lic of»-the-.mishaps«9f.-.elected of-
ﬁcials and to act as a check to the
government’s power.

But for a corruption scandal
that has lasted so long, the news
media hasn’t done nearly enough.
With the exception of front-page
stories in the Post—Gazette and
Tribune Review when the news
first broke, we have not seen
consistent day-to-day coverage
since — the kind of coverage
that would bring the trial to its
knees and get the public fully in-

vested in the circumstances.

When the Post—Gazette broke 
the story of the West Virginia;
ini

University degree scandal
April, articles appeared on the
front page in the newspaper day
after day for months.

The same coverage needs to_

happen here from our regional
news powerhouses.

Dear Editor,

In the Sept. 11 editorial "A legacy of exploitation," The Pitt News editorial board, claims that partisan
politics must be set aside in order to heal the nation. Yet the board manages to commemorate the anniver-
sary of such a tragic event with a veiled political piece. The board manages to attack the Iraq War effort
on two occasions, attacks Republican Rudy Giuliani and criticizes the Bush administration for the passage
of unconstitutional legislation to limit civil liberties. Yet nowhere in the editorial is it mentioned that those
brave men and women serving in uniform have been the ones responsible for preventing another attack on
American soil.

Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama have vastly different political views, yet they managed to put
politics aside on this tragic day. It is a shame that the editorial board of The Pitt News wasn't capable of

putting country above politics, even on the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history.

Students for Concealed Carry on Campus is a nationwide group
comprised of college students, faculty, parents and citizens who are united

in support of allowing those who obtain concealed carry licenses to have’

the right to carry their weapons on college campuses.’ The national group

in both Utah and Colorado have amended their policies to allow concealed

their position on guns, gun culture and concealed carry on campus.

H obsess over outﬁts for speciﬁc events weeks

in advance, but we have to live with the fact
that we can’t undo the gruesome outﬁt we
threw on yesterday as we ran out the door.
Which brings me to my next point.
There always seems to be that one girl who

. . appears to look perfect at all times. I’m sure

you know her. Versions of “that girl” exist
everywhere — in high school, college, work.
Whether she’s in class, in the grocery store
or in Sorrento’s after a night of partying, she
always has it all together.

She’s eternally accessorized to perfec-
tion with her jewelry, her bag and her shoes
matchirig just enough to look polished and
put together, but not so much as to appear

 

, boringior too thought out. It’s all ﬂawless,

impeccable and ultra annoying. Her outﬁt
repeatedly, puts yours to shame.

I especially contemplate this on weeks
like this one when I’m  meetings,
class, ‘work, homework and an internship.
It’s a miracle I’m awake, let alone dressed
decently. I’ve barely given clothes a passing
thought this week —— and too bad, consider-

V ing it’s Fashion Week in New York.

But it would be no problem if I was
“that girl” because she always seems to-have

A an hour or two to shop and keep her ward-

robe fresh, extra minutes in the morning to
curl her hair just right andendless hours to
plan perfectly executed outﬁts. And when
she walks out the door, her look is unpre-
tentious and not one bit contrived. It’s as if

1 her closetthrew up a few items, and she said

“OK” and put them on.

My feelings of frustration and longing to

be “that girl” were validated in Harper’s Ba-

zaar this month. I read an article titled “The I

Secrets of Effortless Dressing” and, while it
preached about why you must own of—the-

moment items,_it also dispelled myths that
these girls who  off this so-called “ef-
fortless dressin ” roll out‘ of bed looking"
fabulous. It also conﬁrmed that this term is,

a bit silly because, in fact, in order to look ef- A
fortless a lot of times, you must put in time‘

and effort. «
' And this is bad news. A

The only  I can hypothesize about i

these impeccably dressed people is that they

must not own one ugly item of clothing. I_

think it’s like dieting. If you‘ikeep junk food
in your kitchen, you’ll end upeating 
food, but if you remove the temptation

‘you’ll be forced to eat healthier. So if you

remove all the bad articles. of clothing from
your wardrobe, you’ll never make a bad,
clothing choice when you pull something
out of your closet half asleep and'sleepy-
eyed in the morning. , '
So I think that the moral is that you must
start with the  blocks‘ of a good
quality«wardrobe if you want good qual-

V ity outﬁts. And it’s important not to. waste-

your money on fast fashion items that are

made poorly and only match one thing in
your closet.‘ We don’t have money to waste
on heaps of poor quality throwaway items
when you can buy a couple gallons of gas
for the price of one shirt at Rue 21.

And say you wear that ridiculous se-
quined Forever 21 number only once, but

_ you wear something that costs ﬁve times as

much almost daily. Right there, your cost
per wear is already way lower. So go ahead
and buy those expensive shoes. It will save
you money in the long-run — and you’re
 the economy  to ratio-
nalize a purchase of fabulous shoes).

OK, so let’s get back to basics. What do
you need to ensure that when you  out
the door, you’re in style every time? Well, I’d
say a good pair of ‘dark denim, a nice pair of
leather, ﬂats, a. chic bag to hold everything, a
ﬁtted blazer thatcan go from work to play,
comfy and colorful cardigans to layer and,as
the weather, gets colder, a_ coat in an interest-
ing color and shape to top everything off.

And as for “that girl,” well, from now on,

she’ll be taking style tips from you.
