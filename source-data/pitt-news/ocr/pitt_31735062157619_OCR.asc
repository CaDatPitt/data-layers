Senior Women VotingforiQueen    

. v’.

, Four and a half hours remain for senior women to
select their queen from seven women named nominees

S Wednesday at the Rose Tea. The polls close today at

5:00 p. In.

Polls have been set up_in the ﬁrst ﬂoor office of
the dean of women so that the voter may name her
choice quickly and quietly without the inconvenience
of travelling to the twelfth ﬂoor, as has been the policy
in former years.

Lenore Mussoﬁ, Virginia Reynolds,- Barbara
Shropp, Margaret Kostelnik, Jean Ditz, Eugenia.
Captain, and Pat Seger comprise the list of nom-
inees. '

The voting today will decide which of these senior

women will be queen. Runner-up will be named Alma
Mater.

Not until Tap Day will the names of the two lead-
ing senior women be disclosed. Coronation will follow
later in the spring. ,

Success of today’s balloting depends largely upon
a heavy vote, WSGA spokesmen observe. One WSGA

,oﬂ‘icial put it this way: “Every senior woman must vote

today; walk, run, or carry your lunch to the polls, but
vote!”

It has been approximated that voting will take
only a few seconds. Before voting, voters should
identify themselves at the ballot box in the first
ﬂoor office of the dean of women. Names of senior

women will be checked off as they vote.
At the Rose Tea Wednesday, attendance far ex-
ceded the turnout for the event in former years.
“Women of the class of ’49 are showing a real interest

in this election,” one court representative stated,” but

the election today will tell the real tale of interest.”

The nominees were named by a group of senior
women selected by the presidents of women’s organi-
zations. Dr. Demas Barnes of the history department
acted as faculty advisor to the group.

Members of the nominating committee included Mae
Lawson, Anna Lou Flaherty, Peggy Dailey, Eugenia
Captain, Celester Cook, Audrey Golomb and Emily Bitt-
ner.

olétta. to

Editor, The Pitt News:

Before this semester's assign-.
ments pile up too heavily, why
not look over some of the many
interesting new books "which have
been added to the Alldred collec-

"tion since the close of the last

semester.

Fiction heads the list with. 18
new titles, divided as usual be-
tween historical novels, and those
dealing with the complexities of
modern life. Of the former, -two
have their locale in the Holy
Land. Howard Fast’s “My Glori-
ous» Brothers” and “Bold Gali-
lean” by Le Gette Blythe. “Eliz-
abeth, Captice Princess,” by Mar-
garet Irwin, deals with the girl-
hod of Queen Elizabeth; Annie
Parrish’s “A Clouded Star” is
based on the life of Harriet Tub-
man, and “A Goddess to a God”
consists of imaginary letters from
Cleopatra to Julius Caesar.

Of the world of modern life,
two have to do with education.
“The Hickory Stick” by Virgil

,Scott deals with the professional

problems of the teacher, and “The
Golden Net,” by Ruby Redinger,
deals with faculty life in a uni-
versity. Also just arrived are the
latest novels of‘Betty Smith, John
Dos Passos, and Aldous Huxley.

On the more serious side are

“Great Soul,” an estimate of

To aid in personal adjustment
are “How to Think ‘About Our-

“A Guide to Conﬁdent Living” by

others have to do with science
and life: Lancelot Whyt_e’s “Every

There are new picture books,

Seiise—Les

By LES GALLAGHER

Well, I read the Student Con-
gress Report last week. I showed
it to my friend, Asa O’Toole. He
read it, too. “What do you think,”
I asked? ‘Lot of meetings,” he
said. “Yeah,’ I said. “Lot of com-
mittees,” Asa said. “Yeah,” I said.
“Lot of good men,” Asa said. I
agreed. “Too bad,” he said.
“Yeah,” I said. “What can you do,
though?” I agreed with him,
“What can you do, though?”

“The way I see it,” Asa said,
“the faculty, or the deans office,
or somebody decided to give the
student body a toy to play with.
They called it Student Congress
and let the students elect to of-
ﬁce the top men of any given
year. Whoever it was that gave
the permission for such an organ-
ization in the first place made
certain that limitations would be
applied to the group" and that
most of the bodies plans and pol-
icies could be controlled.”

“OK,/that’s the way it should
be. Every young group should
start slow. Give a child some ﬁre
and_ he hurts himself. People can

‘ scream and holler and act bored

with Student Congress all they
want but Congress is making pro-
gress. Think of. the years that
have gone by and look_ at some of
the proposed amendments of the
past; ice water in the fountains,
coat hangers in the heads. I hope
you don’t think they were’ good
ideas.” '

'No' to NSA ,
“This year Congress decided on
no National Student Association.

- They agreed against the “demon-

stration block.” “So what,” you
say. ‘So what,” I say, it was just
business they had ‘to clear. But
they deserve a pat on the back
for their proposed plan" of‘ more
and better trained- student. ad-

visors. This is the only drawback

thathl can see with the University
of Pittsburgh, and even then some
of the blame falls‘ to the students.

The faculty advisors don’t seem
to know how many-credits a stu-
dent must have in this or that or
in this or’ that ﬁeld. If Student
Congress can clear up this situa-
tion they will have ﬁlled their of-

ﬁce over and above and far to the ‘

left of the call of duty.” __
“To continue,” Asa said, “I
don’t think that there is much left
around this school that needs ﬁx-
mg or cleaned up or bettered. So

-how can Congress be asked to do

much. I think that under their
Dresent set-up here at the Univer-
$115)’; What with the limitations
on their amendments, plus the
procedure that they must employ,
in addition to business layed in
their laps for stymie_reasons, Con-
gress is doing right good; they’re
growing.” .

With -Tear in Eye

“Another student,” Asa said,
wants to know ‘why Congress
d‘oesn’t quit messing around with
the little things and try to pro-
mote a student union?” “It’s a
fair question . which doesn’t show
much. thought. Congress could ag-
itate from now till dooms day,
they could signpetitions and take
polls, make speeches, have parades,
demonstrations, burn the Chan-
cellor in effigy, and plant weed-
seed in the lawn but it wouldn’t
do any good.

“When the trustees and the fac-

.ulty and whoever else it is in

authority thinks that there should
be a student union and sees that
there is money in the bank to
buck the cost of hammer and nails,
thereill be a student union.”

There was a tear in my eye as
I recalled to mind what Asa had
said, “There ain’t nothing wrong
with this school, just some of the
students.” I wonder if you cbuld
be one of those students. I know
it ain’t me.

Beer Proposal  
In Congress

(Continued from Page 1)
approval will rest with University
oﬁicials and the Board of Trustees.

Under present University so-
cial regulations the sale of al-
coholic beverages at a University

social function is expressly for-

bidden.

Student Congress also passed
an amendment to change the
membership of that body from 15

students to 18 students. The three

additional members, instead of be-
ing electedby the student body,

‘will be two senior men and one

senior woman, chosen from the
previous year’s membership.

Another resolution passed by
Congress set the term of the Stu-
dent Congress representative to
the Athletic Committee to run
from June 1 of one year to May
31 ofvthe following year.

At the same time the body de- ‘

cided that next year’s representa-
tive should be appointed by the
incoming Congress.

On phoning Nick’s room, the re-

porter learned that Nick was
dressing like .mad and would be
there just as fast as his Oldsmo-

At 11:58 the phone rang in
Carlson’s ofﬁce. It was-the down-
town paper calling- to say the
photographer could not make the
appointment. At‘ 11:59 Nick’s
phone- rang and the person ‘who
answered it was. able to stop the
football player just,as he was get-
tingsinto his car. '

The reporter does not know
how Nick reacted to this last mes-
sage. He is not anxious to. ap-
proach Nick to ﬁndout. In fact,
the next time someone ' asks

for picture—taking; he is going" to

A successful foul shot after
nearly» 45 minutes of play spelled
victory for the Pitt Collegians last
Friday evening. ‘

The free throw, made by Chad.
mers (C1131) Stewart, gave the

Collegians a hard-earned 39-37

victory over the Munhall Indians.
The Collegians qualiﬁed to rep-
resent the American League in
the intramural playoffs with the
win. A

At the end of the regulation 32
minutes, with the game tied, 34-
34, it was decided that, in order

to win, a team had to be two full
points ahead. ' ‘

Bill Downey gave the Munhall

boys a one-point advantage by"

sinking a free throw. However,
Johnnie Ribar’s long set shot en-
abled the Collegians to take a
36-35 lead. -Ed Szekely’s two foul
shots for Munhall were nulliﬁed
by Bob Sullivan’s two-pointer.
