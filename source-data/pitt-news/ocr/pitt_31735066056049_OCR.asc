Public hearing discusses the Bigelow closing

Charisee E. Merchant
For The Pitt News

Members of the City
Council and other community
groups held a public hearing last
Thursday night to discuss altema-
tives to closing Bigelow
Boulevard.

It has already been voted
upon to close Bigelow for a 30
day trial period. However,
according to Councilwoman
Valerie McDonold, There will be
no majority vote on a permanent
closing.”

Fred Reginella of the City of
Pittsburgh Engineering and
Construction made two sugges-
tions as alternatives to the clos-
ing. First, he brought up the pos-
sibility of narrowing Bigelow
Boulevard from a four lane street
to two lanes. Second, he suggest-
ed looking into building a traﬁic
tunnel.

“We felt that a tunnel might
have some potential. We retained
a consulting firm,” Reginella
said.

According to Reginella, a
contract with local architecture
ﬁrm Pashek and Associates has
already been established.
Reginella said that $16,000 has
already been authorized by the
City to be used in the project.
The council members at the hear-
ing knew nothing of such an
agreement and were outraged.

 

Councilman Sala Udin
responded, ‘Then what the hell
are we doing here?”

This confusion was due to

the fact that the mentioned con- 9

tract did not follow proper proce-
dure. A contract is usually enact-
ed only after alternative ideas are
presented and voted upon by the
council. To enact a contract
before the public hearing made
the hearing a waste of time,
according to council members.

“That was a violation of
home-rule charter. Any money
spent has to come through coun-
cil,” said Councilman Jim Ferlo.

Jay Roling, Pitt’s director_of
local governmental relations,
stated several reasons for closing
Bigelow Boulevard, including
more green space, elimination of
metered parking on the block,
reduction of vehicular traﬂic, and
improved pedestrian circulation
and safety.

“The university had already
agreed to bear the entire cost of
the traﬁic studies,” Roling said.

University oﬂicials feel that
such a closing would beneﬁt stu-
dents and residents of Oakland.
However, several Oakland resi-
dents who spoke at the public
hearing felt differently.

“It’s time to blow the whistle
on Pitt,” said Jan Markowitz of
Dawson Street, who is strongly
against the closing, temporary or
otherwise. “If I owned Oakland
and owned hell, I would rent out

Reginald Plato, another

Oakland resident, held similar

views: “[Bigelow Boulevard]

should not be disturbed. If it ain’t
broke, don’t try to ﬁx it! The stu-
dents are only here for four to six
years, but we live here.”

Chance of no
students. on
Trustee com- S
miﬂees grows

Benjamin Jackson
Editor-in-Chief

Searching for a chancellor
is not the only thing the Board
of Trustees is doing. There are
changes afoot in the structure
of the Board, including the
probable elimination of stu-
dents, staff, and faculty from
their committees. '

On June 11th, the
Nominating Committee of the
Board met to discuss changes

in the composition of the full 5

board. It is the nominating
committee that is responsible
for nominating new members
to the board and determining
the committee composition.
The nominating committee
also handles the re-election of
current members to the board.

V At this time, the committee
received the recommendations
of the Ad Hoc Committee to
review the current Structure
and Composition of the Board
of Trustees. The committee
was created in order to review
the recommendations of “The
University of Pittsburgh
Review,” which is popularly
kno’wn as the Fischer Report.

Currently, if a person is not
a Trustee or the Chancellor,
then the only way he could be
part of the Board of Trustees is
to serve on one of its commit-

‘tees. The Ad Hoc Committee,

in response to the suggestion
that “memberships on the com-
mittee be limited to Trustees,”
resolved that the Chairman of

the Board should appoint a spe-
, cial committee to examine the

board committee structure.

The resolution of the Ad
Hoc Committee comes out in
favor of the proposal to limit
the membership to trustees. It
says that the third Special
Trustee Committee should
speak with the Presidents of the
University Senate, Staff
Association Council, Student
Government Board, Graduate
and Professional Student
Association, and College of
General Studies Student

Government Board to fin‘d ‘

“alternative mechanisms for
facilitating appropriate partici-
pation and exchanges of infor-
mationand opinions.”

Wuertele met with Board of
Trustees Chairman J. Connolly

Davis honored for jazz conlribuﬁons

Lisa McClendon
Staff Writer

Pitt Jazz Studies Director

‘ Nathan Davis’ name became a

permanent ﬁxture of the Senator
John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional
History Center last Wednesday in
honor of his contributions to jazz
in Pittsburgh and across the coun-

Mellon Bank, in celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the
Mellon Jazz Festival, dedicated
the Mellon Jazz Festival Honoree
Walkway to pay tribute to a
decade of Festival honorees.

“This is an important event
for Mellon because the Mellon
Jazz Festival Honoree Walkway
gives permanent recognition, not
only to Mellon’s commitment to
jazz and Pittsburgh’s heritage as a
jazz center; but most importantly
to the jazz greats, who year after
year really make the Mellon Jazz
Festival come alive,” said Sandra
McLaughlin, senior vice president
and head of Mellon ‘Bank
Corporate Affairs, at the dedica-
tion ceremony.

The walkway features a com-
memorative floor tile for each
Festival honoree. The display will
be visible in the History Center’s
Great Hall. With each dedication
of a new Festival, future honorees
will be added.

“This year is being dedicated

and on

to George Benson, but back then
they dedicated it to me, which
was a little bit unusual since I
[wasn’t] born in Pittsburgh,”
Davis said. “One of the reasons
why [they said they chose me]
was because of the fact that not
only am I a musician that’s played
around the world and made
records, but I waspdoing some-
thing a little bit different. I was
prominent in the academic side of
jazz. We were the pioneers
[because we] were jazz musicians
who came from the actual world
of jazz to teach.” ,

A strong believer in education
and jazz music, Davis has earned
a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from
Wesleyan University in
Connecticut and a B.M.E. from
the University of Kansas, in addi-
tion to bringing jazz all over the
world.

Since 1969, Davis has ‘served
as director of Pitt’s Jazz Studies
program. One year later, he
founded the annual Pitt Jazz
Seminar andAConcert, where top-
name jazz performers from all
over the country travel to
Pittsburgh to speak and perform
for younger students.

“I am very passionate about
[jazz and it’s history],” Davis
said. “As long as I teach, I want to
teach a jazz course to introduce
people to this. This is American.
Jazz was born, bred, thought of
right here, and I think it’s very

appropriate and significant that
they honor jazz greats — past and

present.”
Davis is most proud of his the
University of Pittsburgh

International Academy of Jazz
Hall of Fame. He remembers the
recognition the Hall of Fame
received from Alex Haley, “[He
said,] ‘I walked through the stu-
dent union and I saw that tribute
to jazz there. I am invited to speak
at universities all over the world,
and I have never seen such a trib-
ute to our great jazz heroes like
this.’

“I have done something his-
torically signiﬁcant. That recogni-
tion on the wall of these people,
these great musicians, these
instruments, the private letters
and photographs —~ that is what I
am most proud of,” Davis said.

The other Festival honorees
are Maxine Sullivan (1987); Ray
Brown (1989); Billy Strayhorn
(1990); Mary Lou Williams
(1991); Stanley Turrentine
(1992); Billy Eckstine (1993);
Ahmad Jamal (1994); Joe Harris
(1995); and George Benson
(1996).

ing, Wuertele said Connolly
told him that the suggestion of
the Fischer Report would be
followed, and thus students,
staff, and faculty would be
removed from the committees.
The Ad Hoc Comrr1ittee’s
resolutions were approved as
an entire package by the
Nominating Committee of the
Board. Their other recommen-
dations include retaining the
title of the Chancellor for the
time being, and that when the
new chancellor is selected, the
title change could be consid-
ered. At the same time, they
recommended that “the

Chancellor/President also be '

known as Chief Executive
Officer of the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Trustees will no longer be
required to retire at the age of
70 under the resolutions
approved by the committee.
This also requires that the by-

laws of the University be
changed.

The Compensation and the
Conﬂict of Interest Committees
will remain as they are, and the
Executive Committee will also
be left unchanged. The next
chancellor or president, what-
ever his or her title may be,
will be informally evaluated by
the Compensation committee
each year. Every fourth year,
there will be a formal evalua-
tion.

In other business, the com-
mittee approved a resolution
recommending the re—election
of J.W. Connolly as Chairman
of the Board. Resolutions for
re-electing the executive com-

In New Business,
Committee Member James

that he was concerned about

There are 14 special trustees
who have all the duties of other
board members, but they do
not have the right to vote at
board meetings. Roddey said
that he thought that a founda-

conﬂict. The foundation board

would give attention to institu-

raising, and it could be concur-
rent with the board of Trustees.
No action was taken on this
idea at the meeting, and it was

The search for the chancellor

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 19, 1996

Priorities for new chancellor pile up even before lhe vote

Ben Jackson & Cesca Antonelli
The Pitt News

After the new chancellor eats
pretzels and talks with The Pitt
News, he or she will have a line of
people waiting to advise him or her
on Pitt’s priorities.

According to the “University of
Pittsburgh Review,” also known as
the Fischer Report, the chancellor
needs to involve faculty and admin-
istrators in “strategic planning to
clarify the University’s mission and
priority goals,” as well as to identify
the resources to meet these goals.
Many search committee members
agreed.

“Well, I suppose the first thing
you’ve got to do is make it clear to
anybody who works for the univer-
sity that you’re going to depend on
them for support and want their help
and are going to be open to contacts
about ideas,” said James
Cunningham, a member of the

search committee and a social work
professor. “Secure the home base
and begin to take steps necessary to
raise more resources for the univer-
sity so it can avoid layoffs in the
future.”

The Fischer Report also urges
the new chancellor to strengthen
relations with university, student,
and community groups, as well as
the media, to raise the university’s
profile and address concerns of fac-
ulty and students.

“Make a strong commitment to
student services that affect us out-
side the classroom —- things like
residence life, food services, and
student computing,” said Andy
Wuertele, SGB president and search
committee member.

Randy Juhl, the dean of the
pharmacy schoo1"and member of the
committee, said that the chancellor
needs to spend some time getting to
know the expectations of the Board
of Trustees.

“Our board has become very
active the last two years, and I think
that will benefit us,” Juhl said.
“They have some very definite ideas
about how we should move and
position ourselves in the coming

century.”
James Holland, a member of the
Senate executive committee,

brought up an issue that has started
to plague Pitt in recent times, that of
Pitt’s relationship with the Med
Center and the problems in fundrais-
ing that stem from the confusion.

“UPMC—S [System, the system
of hospitals] is a separate corpora-
tion, and it needs to be recognized
that way,” Holland said. “The con-
fusion of authority has to end.
UPMC buys a hospital; Pitt
announces layoffs. It’s not the same
thing.”

Committee members also
emphasized the need for the chan-
cellor to review aspects of the uni-
versity that directly relate to educa-

  

tion.

“There needs to be strong sup-
port for the emphasis on quality
teaching to bring it up closer to the
attention given to research,”
Cunningham said.

Whatever the specific tasks our
next chancellor faces, there is some
commonality to running any univer-
sity.

“Whoever is incoming chancel-
lor will be advised by many people
about the great challenges that he
will face,” said John E. Murray,

‘president of Duquesne Univeristy.

“All presidents face these great
challenges. My feeling is that there
will be a candidate who is chosen
who is more than up to the chal-
lenges. Whoever it is needs to rec-
ognize this entire community sup-
ports a new chancellor because of
the importance of the university
here and around the world. I think
the new chancellor should come in
feeling very good about that.”

search committee and dean of the School of .

Pharmacy.

According to Roddey, the committee voted
on each candidate, and each of the finalists
received a majority vote. None of the tallies
were unanimous, and some members voted for
two. One member voted for none of the candi-
dates, but Roddey did not release that mem-
ber’s identity.

Members of the search committee have
been working since last fall to narrow the pool
of candidates which began with nearly 160
nominees. Now, like other students, faculty, and
staff, they can only wait and make speculation.

“I don’t have a clue who the trustees are
going to elect,” said Christina Paulston, amem—
ber of the committee. “It’s not really our con-
cern to say what our preference is. Anybody
honorable on the search committee that you ask
should say that it’s not in our place to state our
preference.”

Paulston and other committee members
emphasized that Nordenberg does not necessar-
ily have an inside advantage.

“I always did like outsiders, but tl1ey’re all
three competent,” said James Cunningham, a
committee member and professor of social
work “Sometimes it’s good to get new blood,
but Mark Nordenberg has a lot of momentum.
The team of Nordenberg and [Provost] Maher
has shown to be rather effective, and that team
will be able to do a great deal. Of course, out-
siders offer the chancellor [position] a great
change and new things. You get a tradeoff
there.”

According to committee members,
Connolly and other board members will sit
down tomorrow and make a decision based on
the direction that they feel is right for Pitt to
move into in the next century. a '

“[The candidates] are very different,” said
SGB President Andy Wuertele, who was on
the search committee. “There is a very different
choice here in what direction they want to go.
Do we want to go with the larger Penn State,
Florida State model, or a smaller Ivy League
atmosphere?”

Members of the search committee are also
pleased with the dilferences between the candi-
dates for this search and the search that ended
by naming J. Dennis O’Connor chancellor ﬁve

be prudent for me to go any further in this
process.”

So, with the trustees’ meeting rapidly
approaching and the job of the committee ﬁn-
ished, what can Pitt students take away from
the long search?

“Students need to understand that the peo-
ple whose names went forward as well as
many individuals whose names didn’t make it
to the ﬁnal list were a very well-accomplished
group of individuals,” Juhl said “Pitt is viewed
as a plum job; there were lots of people inter-
ested in having this job. That’s not the percep-
tion I had when I was a student. It’s very evi-
dent by the interest that Pitt is viewed as a top
university.

‘There are things to be ﬁxed, but every
once in a while, it’s good to look back and say
what we are doing right.”

MARK A. NOR-
DENBERG:
Nordenberg has
spent the past 20
years working at Pitt
He became interim
chancellor in August

. of last year and was

dean of the law
school for eight years.
In his time at Pitt, he
has eamed ﬂre respect
of many faculty
members and students.

“I strongly favor Nordenberg,” said James
Holland, an executive committee member. “He
just has it all. He can talk to all the groups
involved His heart and soul is with this univer-
sity. He understands the university; he is able to
make all the kinds of changes and meet all the
needs of the university. He hasn’t just been a
caretaker; he’s made moves and changes.”

According to Holland, Nordenberg has
communicated well with the community and
the Board of Trustees, as well as earning the
respect of many faculty members with his
“cooperative management style.”

“You’ve really got to build support and
consensus at Pitt,” said Keith McDufﬁe, the
president of the University Senate. “I should
point out that Nordenberg has experience with
us. He’s been a teacher, a dean, a chair of a vari-
ety of committees. I think it would be hard to

years ago. hold a candle to that”

“Last time, r _ ‘ McDuﬂie has been

“That’s a big differ- “[Nordenberg] is

ence. [Presidents] are much more involved in
fundraisers, state relations. Provosts are not
chief ﬁmdraisers. They’re really the chief oper-
ating ofﬁcers. To move to chancellor, that’s a
different situation.”

v Disclosing the names of the nominees has
also lifted some of the mystery surrounding
other possible candidates like John E. Murray,
the current president of Duquesne University.
Throughout the search, faculty and students
have speculated about the possibility of his
applying for the position.

“[Murray] never said he was a candidate,”
said James Holland, a member of the executive
committee who met with the ﬁnalists. “He may
well like where he is; he certainly got some
very good results there.” ‘

Murray worked at Pitt as a professor and
as dean of the law school prior to assuming his
position at Duquesne.

“I feel a loyalty to Pitt, but my ﬁrst loyalty
has to be Duquesne,” Murray said. “I had
reﬂected on this and decided that it would not

very much a known quantity, and he could hit
the tarmac nmning,” McDuﬁie said. “There is
some objection to him by those who think we
need to bring in some new blood from outside.
In this particular case, I don’t think it is ideal.
What we need more than anything else is
someone who will  move us forward.”

McDufﬁe feels that Nordenberg is a con-
sensus builder who has both campus and com-
munity support, but not all involved with the
process shared the same feelings about
Nordenberg.

In a letter to the search committee, Richard
Tobias, a member of the executive committee
who met with the finalists, opposed
Nordenberg. Tobias mentioned a law suit
against the university that names Nordenberg,
then-dean of the law school, in seven of its 22
counts, including discrimination and violation
of conﬁdentiality.

Nordenberg joined Pitt’s law school in
1977 and became dean in 1987. He left that
post in 1993 to serve for one year as interim

provost and senior vice chancellor for academic
aﬂ"airs. Prior to coming to Pitt, Nordenberg was
a faculty member at the Capital City Law
Center. He received his law degree magna cum
laude from the University of Wisconsin in 1973
and completed his undergraduate work at.Thiel
College m. 1970. ’

SHERRY H. PENNEY:

Penney has been an administrator for 23
years. She has served as the chancellor of the
University of Massachusetts’ Boston campus
for eight years now, coordinating a $125 mil-
lion budget, over 12,000 students, and 600 fac-
ulty.

“Penney seems like an excellent chancellor
and has experience that is very relevant to us,”
said James Holland, a member of the executive
committee who met with the ﬁnalists.

Penney has faced budget crunches while at
UMass that have
included numerous
budget cuts and has
still managed to
increase enrollment,
a feat Pitt would like
to repeat. In recent
times, she success-
fully completed a
$70 million fund-
raising campaign.
She has helped to
increase the number
of grants UMass receives until now, the univer-
sity follows just behind Harvard and MIT in
the state.

In 1995, she served as interim president of
the entire UMass system, which consists of

58,000 students, 14,000 faculty, and a $1.3 bil-

lion budget.

Penney has initiated programs at UMass to
strengthen admission standards, improve SAT
scores, and strengthen Honors Programs, other
features that search committee members at Pitt
thought were particularly important

Many faculty and search committee mem-

bers noted that Penney had been willing to 3
have her name made public early on in the .

search.

“I would say that a candidate who is com-
mitted enough to the search and willing to
undergo broader public scrutiny is certainly to
be commended for that step,” Mark Ginsburg
said. “I wouldn’t use just one factor, but it’s cer-
tainly a good sign on her part that she was a
participant that I think ﬁts better with the values
of the University of Pittsburgh.”

Penney was recently among two ﬁnalists
in a presidential search at Northeastern
University in Boston. The search there selected
Richard Freeland of City University of New
York

Members of the search committee
expressed concern about whether or not she
would be able to be as successful in Western
Pennsylvania, a more conservative area, and
able to transfer her success to Pitt, a much larg-
er institution. Pitt has almost 32,000 students,
20,000 employees, and an $800 million budget.

Penney was named chancellor and profes-
sor of American studies at UMass in 1988. She
has served as a vice chancellor at the State
University of New York and as the associate
provost at Yale. Penney received her Ph.D.

However, many people
involved in the Search don’t think

that his experience in governmen-

lack of experience with faculty
and students. Reed became a
chancellor without ever having
been a dean, department chainnan,
or even a full professor.

Previously, Chesler said
that not publicizing the names
was a matter of being discreet
and following the candidates’
wishes. He went on to say that

informal checking by faculty .

and staff who had colleagues
at the candidates’ home uni-
versities would provide infor-
mation about the candidate
that the search committee may
not have been able to access
otherwise. There were also two
firms hired to do background
checks on the candidates.

Once the names were
released, Chesler said, “[Since
the names have been released]
the networking now is really
for faculty, staff, people in the
university community, and
friends of the people in the
university to do some check-
ing.” .
Committee members stress
that putting the names forward
will not impact the search.

‘‘I don’t think the release «

changes anything,” Christina
Paulston said. “[The Search
Committee’s] work is ﬁnished.
If any of these three candidates
have any black skeletons in
their closets and somebody
comes forward with it before
the board meeting, that may
change something.”

“I was definitely pleased
to see that there was an
announcement of who the can-
didates are,” said Mark
Ginsburg. “I’m concerned that
the announcement comes so
late in the process, particularly
if the plan is to announce who
the Board of Trustees appoints
this week. It really restricts
any opportunity for public dis-
cussion and further informa-
tion gathering by students,
staff, faculty, or the larger

community.”

 Opinions / Editorial

A chancellor for all seasons

Shortly after 8:30 A.M. this Thursday, Pitt will likely
have a new chancellor. Throughout the week, the mem-
bers of the search committee, the Board of Trustees, and
the University Senate have all been talking about who
ought to be chosen.

The group that hasn’t been heavily involved has been
the student body. There has been some student input in
the form of various student group leaders on the commit-
tee, but the secrecy surrounding the search and the fact
that this search is drawing to a close while most students
are gone have given them very little say in this process.
The summer is an excellent time for the administration
to make end runs around the students and leave them
with no recourse when they return in the fall.

As the board considers who will be named as the
chancellor, it must consider the students whose lives will
be drastically affected by the action or inaction of the
next chancellor.

Any university worth its salt places education as its
firstpriority. Educating students is why the university
exists. While Pitt considers its mission to be three—fold
— education, research, and service — providing well-
educated, thinking people for society is the best service
that this or any other university can provide.

Pitt needs someone who will put good teaching first.
There has been much talk about political savvy and
fund-raising, but good work speaks for itself. Instead of
good advertising, a good university should be built. The
students will be the best recommendation to people con-
sidering giving money to Pitt. Success breeds success,
and the students will share their success with Pitt as
alumni —- if they see Pitt as being responsible for their
success.

Pitt needs someone who will work with students at
all levels. We need someone with hands—on experience in
the classroom and on campus. We need someone who
understands the need for direct student, staff, and faculty
representation at the highest levels of Pitt’s administra-
tion. Pitt needs a leader who understands the difference
between substance and appearance.

The next Pitt chancellor should be someone who is
willing to move around on campus and personally find
out what is happening at all levels‘ of the campus com-
munity. Give us a chancellor who occasionally eats
breakfast in the cafeterias so that he knows what it is
really like for the students.

We can only know after the fact if the board has
made a good decision. But it is only then, when we have
to live with the consequences. As Thursday approaches,
we hope the trustees will keep the students in the fore-
front of their minds.

Don't take the trust out of ‘trustee’

 

Andy
Wuertele

On Thursday, the Board
of Trustees will hold its sum-
mer meeting to make a num-
ber of decisions which will
vastly affect the future of our
university. The final selection
of a permanent Chancellor
alone should be enough to
attract a substantial crowd of
interested onlookers. Among
other items on the agenda,
though, is a proposal to initi-
ate a process that will remove
students, faculty, and staff
from the committees of the
Board. This is a move specifi-
cally designed to eliminate
communication links between
the students, faculty, and staff
and the Trustees themselves.

You see, the Chairman of
the Board, J.W. Connolly,
believes that whomever they
name as the next permanent
leader of our university
shouldn’t be affected by what
the people she or he is hired
to lead, employ, and educate
think of the Chancellor or
about where Pitt should go
and how it should get there.
He has indicated that any
information shared between
those ‘above’ and those
‘below’ the Chancellor would
keep her or him from making
sure that Trustees, students,

faculty, and staff didn’t know
any more than was - good for

. them.

, Of course this isn’t a
unique problem; most univer-
sities struggle with the vari-
ous relationships between
their participants. In fact, ﬁve
or six years ago this was a
considerable problem at Pitt.
Students, faculty and staff
constantly pushed for more
involvement, going as far as
to request that they have rep-

resentatives on the Board of

Trustees itself. In attempting
to find a compromise, the
administration suggested and
the Board agreed to include
students, faculty, and staff
and changed to the committee
structure that we have today.

That didn’t solve all of
the problems. We are still an
institution notorious for poor
inside communication. But
the relationship between the
Trustees and the rest of us
isn’t talked about much here
because we have a forum
where the voices from differ-
ent perspectives can come
together and share ideas,
goals, and objectives. Instead
of questioning why Penn
State and Florida have
Student Trustees and Pitt does
not, we seek to use our pres-
ence on the committees to
best represent our needs. It’s a
win—win situation.

On the other hand, I can
see how someone could win
with Connolly’s suggestion.
As Student Government
President, I don’t want any of
the people whom I represent
to tell my advisor when I
could use help in some area
or that they don’t agree with
how I thought the activities
fee should be allocated. And I
certainly wouldn’t want any-
one to say something bad

about me in front of my con-
stituents. My job would be
much easier ifI didn’t have to
live with the decisions I made
or worry about doing the
right thing.

Perhaps I should talk to
the Trustees about arranging
some deal like this for
myself. We could start by get-
ting rid of the Allocations
Committee altogether and let-
ting me take care of the
money decisions alone.
Though I wouldn’t be able to
do it very well without their
input and expertise, it
wouldn’t matter. Nobody
would have to know when I
made a mistake. As long as I
told the administration that all
of the students were happy
and told the students that the
administration made me do it,

everything would be perfect. ‘

Especially for me.

Sound good to .you? I
didn’t think so. Taking this
kind of approach to gover-
nance and leadership is inap-
propriate, and worse, it’s inef-
fective. Let’s face it, the
University of Pittsburgh has
hit a low point, and all of us
are going to have to work
together over the next several
years to put it back on the
road to the top. Instead of tak-
ing this broad step back-
wards, Pitt should look for
ways to get even more input
from the student customers
who provide it with a reason
for being. Excluding students,
faculty, and staff from com-
municating and working with
the Trustees can only hurt the
chances of achieving that
which is best for us all. ~

ports changed my life

— really. A story

about my salvation as

a reformed couch potato
and how I got a real job:

When I first put on a

pair of ice skates and real-

ized I could be an athlete, I

was a graduate student in
theatre. My days were spent
in dark theatres. One of my
professors asked the class to
define the difference
between sports and theatre.

So I started thinking
and writing about sports.
Anteditor asked me to write
for his magazine. Yet writ-
ing wasn’t enough. In the-
atre we were taught you had
to do theatre, to create the-
atre, to write about theatre.

As a remedy, I started
skating. Before that, I
couldn’t make it through a
volleyball match.

Since I started skating,
everything haschanged. My
schedule now revolves
around practice time.
Putting on sneakers has
taken on elements of a reli-
gious ritual. I have_ discov-
ered I can perform physical
feats -— like climbing the
Cathedral stairs — that
once had been impossible. I
read everything I can on
weight training. I now know
something millions‘of boys
already knew: Sports is fun.

I have fallen in love
with sports, and most
important I learned to like
and appreciate my body and
its newfound muscles. It’s a —
lesson important to any
woman. Just last week,
female obsession with thin-
ness made the cover of
People magazine. As any
boyfriend can attest and
numerous surveys have
documented, most women
think they need to lose
weight and that part of their
value comes from being
attractive.

Sports can change that
perception. Friends, par-
ents, and teachers praise
boys for hitting a baseball

For the last four years,
two words could be men-
tioned whenever talking
about Pitt’s track & field
team — N ajuma Fletcher.

However, as the spring
season unfolded, culminating
a long year of competition,
several other athletes rose to
the occasion, giving Pitt an
exciting finish to another suc-
cessful year. .

One such athlete was
freshman sensation Trecia
Smith.

Smith’s improvement
throughout the year suddenly
skyrocketed near the end of
the spring season. She earned
a birth in the NCAA Outdoor
Track & Field

Championships for the long
jump, triple jump, and hep-

spring season at the NCAAs,
placing second in the nation
in the triple jump and sixth in
the long jump.

“A new star has been
born on this team,” head
coach Steve Lewis said of
Smith.

Pitt also sent Fletcher and
runner Angie Martin to the
NCAAs. Fletcher, bothered
with a hamstring injury, won
the high jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships, but
could not overcome her
injury and failed to earn a
high place in her final com-
petition as a Panther. Martin
failed to qualify for the finals
of the 800-meter run.

The meet before the
NCAAs, the ECAC/IC4A
Championships, probably
ranks as the best overall meet

Pztt News F tle Photo

The highlight of Panther hurdler Jay Murphy's 1996 track 8:

field

season came at last month's lC4A Championships,

where he placed fifth in the ll0-meter high hurdles.

with over 80 other universi-
ties, the Pitt women placed
third and the men finished
ninth.

“This is a meet with
schools from Maine to
Florida, all over the East
Coast,” Lewis said. “This is
the next best thing to nation-
als.”

Smith finished first in the
women’s triple jump and the

‘heptathalon. To round out

one of the best individual
performances in Pitt history,
Smith also garnered a third
place finish in the long jump
and eighth place in the shot
put.

“Being a freshman,”
Lewis said, “The response by

Trecia is beyond anything»

you’d expect. She had a fan-
tastic meet.”

On‘ the men’s side,
speedy sprinter Jay Jones and

-~hurdler Orrel Green contin-

ued strong seasons at the
ECAC’s. Jones finished third
in the 100-meter dash with a
time of 10.47 seconds, just
shy of qualifying for the
NCAAs. He also finished
sixth in the 200-meter.

Green placed. second on
the 400—meter intermediate
hurdles, normally fast enough
for the NCAAS, but not this
year. Jay Murphy edged out
Green in the 110—meter high
hurdles, placing fifth. V

Championships saw Fletcher
earn the women’s Most

Sports Editor Smith highlighted the Competing against a field setting Big East meet records

in both. Smith took home
first place honors, beating
Fletcher in the long jump.

The men didn’t fare as
well at the Big Easts, but Jay
Jones did win the 100-meter
dash (Pitt has now won this
event for three straight
years).

Besides dominating two
home events against weaker
competition,‘ the Panther
Relays and Pitt Invitational,
the team got to travel to
places like Miami, Fla.,
Alabama and Jamaica to
compete in various relay
meets one of Pitt’s
stronger areas.

At the Alabama Relays in
March, Tonya Mullins led the

way for the women by partic-

ipating on "two winning relay
teams and was on two other
teams that nearly won.
“[Mullins] demonstrated
her leadership and the impor-
tance of her to this team,”

Lewis said. “Anything we did '

of importance involved her.”

Pitt began the 1996 out-
door season at the Jamaica
Relays, in Kingston, Jamaica.
The meet serves as a tune-up
for the Jamaican National
Championship Meet, and Pitt
was one of only eight schools
in the U.S. invited.

Fletcher and Smith, who
hails from Jamaica, high-
lighted the outdoor opener.
Fletcher won the high jump,
and Smith placed high in sev-
eral events.

Next fall, Pitt will again
look forward to a good year,
with athletes Smith and Jones
returning to ‘tear up the
tracks.

Bulls now rest with basl<etl3all’s all-time best

Mike Kovak
Sports Editor

As the inevitable approached for the
Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan rushed
the court with his teammates. Jumping in
celebration, he clutched the ball and
didn’t let go.

Jordan’s outpouring of emotions,
much of it attributed to the memories of
his murdered father, climaxed the relent-
less pursuit of his fourth NBA title in the
last six years.

“I never doubted that I could get
back this moment, and the fact that it
happened on Father’s Day makes it even
more special,” Jordan said at a post—game
press conference, moments after the
Bulls defeated the scrappy Seattle Super
Sonics 87-75 in Game 6 of the NBA
Finals.

However, Jordan’s performance was
rather disappointing, scoring 22 points on
a dismal 5-for-19 shooting performance.
For the second time in the series, the
Bulls turned to Dennis Rodman to pro-
vide the spark.

Rodman continually frustrated the
Sonics, this time with his physical play
instead of the ususal mental torture.
Rodman tied his own NBA Finals record

with 11 offensive rebounds (Elvin Hayes
also shares the record) and nine crucial
points.

Rodman officially put the Sonics out
of the series when Jordan found him run-
ning the lane on the fast break. Rodman,
not known for fancy moves, did a reverse
lay-up that ignited the sold-out crowd at
the United Center and put the Bulls up by
double digits with under seven minutes
left to play.

“I don’t know who the MVP of this
series is,” Sonics head coach George
Karl said. “But I do know that Dennis
Rodman won two games in this series.”

Jordan, not Rodman, did take home
Finals MVP honors for the fourth time in
his historic career, becoming the first
player to do so. He averaged 27 points
for the series, finishing the playoffs with
a 30.7 points per game average.

Scottie Pippen, who has been com-
plaining of ankle problems throughout
the playoffs, responded to media criti-
cism by contributing 17 points, eight
rebounds, five assists, a game—high four
steals and three 3-pointers.

The most telling stat from Game 6 is
not an individual achievement; it’s in
team rebounds. Chicago completely out-
muscled the Sonics on the boards, out-

a 4-2 series win over the Sonics.

rebounding them 51-35, including a
whopping 24-12 advantage on the offen-
sive end, and forced 20 turnovers.

After losing the first three games in
convincing fashion, most people wrote
off the Sonics. However, Seattle added
drama to a lifeless series by winning
games four and ﬁve at home.

Despite losing all momentum, history
sided with the Bulls. No team in the his-
tory of the NBA lost a series after gain-
ing a 3-0 lead and no team ever lost the
ﬁnal two games of the championships at
home to lose a series.

or scoring a touchdown. The
same adults then praise girls
for being pretty. We gain
attention through our looks,
not our actions. Even when
we rebel, coloring our hair
purple or putting earrings
through our noses, girls speak
through how they look —— not
how they perform.

Sports transforms women
and girls into active perform-
ers through the ability to
attempt to catch a football,
the ability to attempt to land a
salchow onto a sheet of ice

using just a quarter inch of
steel, and the opportunity to
kick a ball into a soccer net.
All of a sudden it doesn’t
matter how our hair looks.
What’s important to an ath-
lete is that her hair is out of
her face and that the clothes
she wears allow her to move.

This new enthusiasm for
sports spilled over from my
hobbies into my graduate
work. One free-lance article
led» to another. My side-line
soon began to look like it
could become a vocation. In
September, I walked into The
Pitt News. -

Next week, I start on the
staff of small Ohio newspaper
— as a sports writer. I can’t
say I’ll miss Pitt, but I will
miss The Pitt News. I learned
a lot this year about athletes,
athletics, and the role they
can play in our lives. I
learned that theatre was not
the only place for people with
vision to give birth to their
dreams. Sports, as well as
theatre, furnishes a stage for
the performer’s passion to
change the audience’s per-
spective and touch their
hearts. I.love seeing pony-
tailed, baggy t-shirted women

with big beefy thighs dive for
the ball at women’s world
cup soccer.

I especially enjoy the
wide-eyed look of little girls
watching the athletes. The
girls don’t judge the size of
the athlete’s thighs; they just
want to see if she gets that
ball where it belongs.

Sports gives all athletes a
sense of purpose and keeps
enthusiasm as a part of their

lives. Sports writing isn’t for =

everyone, but participating in
sports is. I compete a few
times a year. Gold medals
hang on my wall.

I’ve even thought far
enough ahead to plan to com-
pete in track and field at the
senior Olympics. I saw a spe-
cial on a 65- year-old woman
who taught herself to throw
the javelin. If she can do that,
so can I.

College — and even more
the work world —— can envel-
op purpose and convolute
ambition with mundane
responsibilities. We can for-
get what makes us passionate
and proud. So it is important
to always make time for
sports. Whether it is a round
of golf or a quick game of

tennis in-between classes,
sports can change your life.

Nichole wants to thank the
copy desk staff, her editors,

athletes for their help and
inspiration in finding her

Directed by Jim Mallon

Starring Trace Beaulieu, Michael J Nelson
and Jim Mallon

You know the scenario —— a man, two
robots, and some inconsequential b-ﬁlm —-
and you know their purpose: to cram as
many one-liners as possible into those
cheap ﬁlms of yesteryear, the kind that
were so stale, so low-budget, they co11ldn’t
possibly have afforded to buy a joke for
their own scripts. As far as watching people
watch things goes, Mystery Science Theater
3000 has made postmodern passivity about
as funny it could be (unlike those two on
MTV, uh huh—huh).

‘This time ‘round the punching bag is
This Island Earth, a movie about some
alien nation whose atmosphere has run out

of uranium, and the leaders are
inviting/abducting the best scientists on
Earth to produce uranium. Because This
Island Earth was made in the ﬁfties and
also seems to have been made for under a
hundred—grand, it’s the typical and perfect
ﬁlm for MST3K’ s barbed wire assault.

If MST3K wears thin after, say, the
eighth Star Trek reference, then you’re like
me, and that’s why we never watched the
show for more than a half-hour at a time on
cable. But wait the ﬁlm out for those juicy
turd jokes, when everything gets really
ridiculous with killer cockroach-looking
security guards and lots of seemingly ad-
libbed lines, and it will all seem worth those
several tedious moments (When waiting to
be depressurized in what looks to be a
smoke-ﬁlled bong on some spaceship, with
that giant-sized insect thing attacking, dia-

 Mystery Science proves...spacemen pee!

logue like such is overlayed: Cal: “I just
farted.” “I farted.” I farted, again.” Dr.
Ruth: “Now I farted.” Hmmm...maybe you
just have to see this scene to get it in all its
magniﬁcence.)

MST3K: The Movie is an encyclopedic
joke book of ‘70s TV show references,
drug taking references, and Keanu Reeves-
isms, plus umpteen jokes about ﬂimsy ﬁlm
props, the Jetsons, Naa—Nuu Naa—Nuu,
Flock of Seagulls, blah, blah and blah. So if
sophisticated postmodemship is your bag,
then MST3K will seem ﬂat and less smart
than silly. That’s what makes it so weird.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie
runs at The Rex theater, South Side today
AND tomorrow. But you can also ﬁnd it at
a few cineplexes.

R.L. Burnside
A Ass Packet of Whiskey
Matador Records

In 1996, no one lives (or
plays) the blues like R. L.
Burnside. He’s the baddest gin-
soaked, pistol—packin’ guitar
player north of the Delta, and
he’s been tearin’ shit up recent-
ly, touring like a madman here
in the States, in Europe, and in
Japan. Nothing could get in my
way last Thursday night when I
found out (almost too late) that
R.L. was playing out at
Moondog’s in Blawnox. Tone
L. Glue and I loaded up on
ammo, booze, and dope, and we
were on our way.

R.L. Burnside hails from
the hills of Holly Springs in
northwest Mississippi, and has
been playing the blues for forty-
something-odd years. He was
taught how to play the guitar by
his neighbor, the legendary Fred
McDowell, who was first

recorded by Alan Lomax in
1959. After touring with the Jon
Spencer Blues Explosion last
fall, Burnside was picked up by
Matador Records and A Ass
Packet of Whiskey, which was
just released yesterday, features
the playing of the entire Blues
Explosion on every track, and
reﬂects the inﬂuence of their
New York City funk sound.
Having Jon Spencer on board to
scream and moan, and emulate
R.L.’s trademark “Well, well,
well...” vocal expression doesn’t
hurt, either.

At Moondog’s, R.L. and his
homeboy Kenny Brown got
down for at least an hour of
Real Life Blues and Boogie
Shakedown, much to the delight
of the denizens of Moondog’s
and.the twenty or so white kids
from the city (like myself) who
were ﬁrst exposed to Bumside’s
magic last September when he
played at Graﬁtti with the Blues
Explosion. Needless to say,
R.L.’s blues is not at all the
same blues played by Spencer
—— I doubt R.L. has spent much
time doin’ the scumfuck shuffle

Tone L. Glue/For The Pitt News

He plays the blues...and pool. .

Tone L. Glue/For The Pitt News .

or hangin’ out with disease—n'd-
den postpunls and funk junkies,
but hell, who knows for sure?
Bu1nside’s blues are the tradi-
tional blues of longing and lust
and love and drink and sadness.
Spencer’s blues are obviously
quite a different creature entire-
ly.

But when they get together
on A Ass Packet of Whiskey ,
recorded live one afternoon in
February» in Holly Springs, the
results are absolutely rockin’.
The ﬁve-piece band (consisting
of Burnside, Kenny Brown,
Judah Bauer, Russell Simins,
and Spencer) stomp through
classic Burnside gems like
“Goin’ Down South” a11d
“Shake ‘em On Down,” and lay
down some new tracks, like
“Tojo Told Hitler” and “The
Criminal Inside Me”, both co-
written by the Blues Explosion.

Simins’s beat-box-style
drumming really lends itself to
Burnside’s electric groove. As
usual, Kenny Brown lays‘down
one mean lick after another, ﬁll-
ing in the generous spaces that
R.L. leaves for him to play

within. The double guitar attack
of Spencer and Bauer is unpar-
alleled, and when these two
gentlemen start in on the har-
monica, Theremin, and ever-
trendy Casio SK-1, the chaos
implicit in the blues really
begins to take hold in much the
same way that the Royal Trux
cook it down on Twin
Inﬁnitives.

This record is a triumph of
inter—generational blues-and-.
noise union and youthful aban-
don, kickin’ mo’ ass than don-
key spurs. I would highly rec-
ommend it to any fan of living,
breathing blues reality. It might
be a good idea for anyone not
already familiar with R.L.
Burnside to pick up his 1994
release Too Bad Jim on Fat
Possum Records before listen-
ing to this collaborative effort.
Unless, of course, you are a
Blues Explosion fan, in which
case you’re probably already
salivating at the thought of lis-
tening to this masterpiece of
American music.

Pomo For Pyros
Good God’s Urge
Warner Brothers

Like most kids I know who
grew up listening to Jane’s
Addiction, I had pretty much
given up any hopes of frontman
Perry Farrell making any more
good music in these, his Golden
Years. His band Pomo For Pyros’
debut album was essentially an
ego—propelled piece of half-assed
funk, served complete with a
good healthy portion of glistening
Videodrome-style manipulation
and bad sexist humor. I was con-
vinced that old Perry had sunk
too far beneath the surface of a
gold—rimmed swimming pool
filled with champagne, cocaine,
heroin, and caviar. In my mind,
lV[r. Farrell was about as close to
the essence of PUNK ROCK as
that schmuck from Bush is.

None of this explains why I
willingly picked up the new
Porno For Pyros album a few
days after it came out, nor why,
surprisingly enough, I love it.

Certainly Perry Farrell is not
as much of a down and dirty

PUNK ROCK hero as he used to

be. He never really claimed to be
one, either; he made it clear from
the beginning that he was after a
lot of money (of course, so did
the Sex Pistols, and now Johrmy
Rotten is doing Mountain Dew
commercials, but that’s another
matter), and a whole lot of drugs
as well. The thing is, he kept beg-
ging to be considered an artist,
for his efforts, and I’ll grant that
he was (and is) something of an
artist, though certainly he is not
exactly the Postmodern conquis-

tador that I think he sees himself
as being.

Good Gods Urge is certain-
ly more of an Art thing than a
Punk thing, and that is precisely
why it succeeds. If Jane’s
Addiction had tiied to get away
with the use of samplers, loops,
and other techno-inspired
devices, as Porno does on this
one, I probably would have
balked at the thought of it. As it
stands, however, the combination
of technology and guest musi-
cians really works in the band’s
favor.

The opening track, “Po1poise
Hea ”, is my fave. The members
of Love and Rockets help the
band out on that one, and PUNK

’ ROCK legend Mike Watt (of

Minutemen/ﬁrehose fame) plays
bass on half the album. Let’s not
forget the fact that former Jane’s
axeman Dave Navarro plays a
“guitarintro” on “Ocean”, on
which his new partner ‘Flea also
plays bass.

Getting past the hype,
Fa1rell’s lyrics are actually sort of
poetic once again, and the fact
that he has pulled out of the
Lollapalooza Scam also indicates
that he might have his head
straightened out again. He has big
ideas for his new ENIT Festival,
which include a sit—down meal
for two-thousand, and a celebra-
tion of sex and drugs.

’ Good God’s Urge succeeds
insofar as it is a whole hell of a

lot better than the last album, and _

it proves that too much crack-
smoking does not necessarily
destroy the creative spirit. Fans of
Side B of Ritual De La Habitual
should enjoythis album. Let’s
hope Farrell and company can
continue to age with such grace
the next time around.

Metallica

0 from page 10

entitled Metallica) was so
successful it is a wonder that
they would want to change
anything. The new album,
however, seems to go in every
direction and falls short every
time. “Ain’t My Bitch” is a
truly -insipid tune that kicks
off the album and is a clue to
the listener that this is “not
your father’s Metallica.” It
drags on for a few minutes
until finally and mercifully it
finishes.

“Ain’t My Bitch” is the
worst song on the entire
album, making it a poor song
for the lead—off track. Then
again, nothing else really
sounds much better. “2 x 4” is
almost as dragging as the first
track, and it seems as if the
band doesn’t know whether to
go hard—core or alternative.
Instead it just meanders a bit.

This is not to say that the
album is without the good ol’
fashioned Metallica style.
Around the middle of the disc,
there are three or four pretty
decent tunes in a row. “Hero
of the Day,” “Bleeding Me,”
and “Cure” bring back some

of that nostalgic Metallica, A

but then the listener is herded
back off to graze on some
insidious country song of all
things.

Did I say “Ain’t My
Bitch” is the worst song on
the album? Maybe I need to
qualify that remark. “Mama
Said” is very close to tying it
for that dubious distinction.
Pure and simple, this is a
country song (a bad one at
that) that has some distortion

along with its twang.

Metallica probably
released this album hoping to
please everybody, but in the
end, they please nobody. Old
Metallica fans will be totally

.put—off by the band’s move

away from the thrash metal
days, fans gathered from the
Metallica days have gone on
to other things in their long
absence, and the altema-fans
they were hoping toigain just
can’t accept listening to band
called “Metallica”. In other
words, when Metallica comes
back with a new album in a
couple more years, this one
will still be circulating the
bargain bins.

“On the Verge”
written by Eric Overmyer
directed by Jim Prescott

 

You’re about to enter a
dimension of sight and
sound. “On the Verge” is a
surrealistic comedy that
resembles the deranged
motif of the twilight zone.
Three American women
from the Victorian era slip

through time exploring odd-
ities of history. Author Eric
Overmyer has taken the
personalities of actual
female explorers and sent
them into a warp of comical
terrains.

The cast is made up of

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 19, 1996

Point Park faculty members
Kathryn Aronson, Nancy
Chesney, and Shirley
Tannenbaum. Multifaceted
Fannon Holland performs
the various characters that
the trio runs into on their
quest.

Director Jim Prescott
says that Holland’s charac-
ters represent the mythical
unknown. Holland believes
that the plot is the mystical
element, and the characters
are more down to earth.
“They are on a voyage of
self discovery,” said
Holland. “The women are
ahead of their time and
don’t fit in 1889.” Without
explanation, the women are
zapped into an array of
anachronisms.

The message that the
performance portrays
through its chronological
antics is that the future is
now. Holland also believes
that the theme urges people
not to waste time. “The
actual women didn’t come
back from their treks and
were lost,” said Holland.
“Let’s say they moved on

and got lost in time.”

When asked why the
playwright chose women
explorers, Holland com-
mented that people are

already acquainted with
adventurous males charac-
ters. “The characters are
strong women who are held
back by their own‘time,”
said Holland. “This is a
very feminist play that lets
the audience know that
women can be strong and
still survive.”

The set looks like a
space—age junkyard. Odd
artifacts dangle from poles
along with three TV moni-
tors added for special multi-
media effects. The screens’
messages interact with the
plot by flashing excerpts
from the actual journal
writings of the characters.
The connection between the
surreal play and the real
stories of these women is
their search for freedom. A
central idea is that there is
territory left unexplored.
This last frontier may not
be physical but rather the
discovery of finding one’s
strength.

On the Verge marks the
end of the Pittsburgh
Playhouse ’s season. It will
run Wed—Sun till June 30.
