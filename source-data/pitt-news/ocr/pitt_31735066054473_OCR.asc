New said, because they want

New Pitt buses, with wheelchair lifts, help  improve capus shuttle service.

New shuttle buses, route changes
improve Pitt’s transportation system

Isadora Murphy

  

For The Pitt News

As part of continuous upgrades in
transportation, Pitt recently acquired big-
ger shuttle buses that facilitate the handi-
capped.

The old‘ Transmark buses, which
were retained as backups, didn’t all com-
ply with the Americans Disabilities Act.
The new buses, built by Bluebird, have
wheelchair lifts and tie-down seat belts
that hold wheelchairs ﬁrmly in place.

“I think it’s great for students to have
nice new buses out there,” said Jerry
Kvortek, of the Security and
Transportation Department.

Pitt’s shuttle buses run 21 to 23 hours
a day, with a total of 32,000 hours of ser-
vice last year. Buses have a four- to ﬁve-
year life cycle and get worn down easily
from usage. Last year, more than 1 mil-
lion people took advantage of the bus sys-
tem.

The new North Oakland bus can ﬁt
more people and is more accessible for
students.

“The seating is better because it’s
easier to get in and out as opposed to the
old ones, which were more like school

buses,” said Jennifer Kells, resident of .

North Oakland resident.
Though there are no new routes, the

I North Oakland bus has added a new stop

at Forbes Avenue at the Forbes’-Craig

Apartments and, as a result of student
requests, the ‘bus will now stop at Center i
' Plaza at all times. 1

The Sutherland, Express shuttle has
eliminated a stop at the Eureka building
by Magee-Women’s Hospital. After 9

p.m., the bus goes ﬁ'om a 20-minute loop.

to a 15-minute loop.
“We adjust the routes every year
based on what the students tell us,” said

G. Robert Harkins, director of parking
and transportation. “If the students have
any concerns, they should send us e-
mail.”

Decisions on transportation go
through the transportation committee,
which has representatives from the
Student Government Board, the Graduate
and Professional Student Association, the
College of General Studies and the
Resident Student Association.

Study shuttles, which link all resi-
dence halls, computer labs and libraries
together, will continue to run Monday
through Thursday 9 p.m. to 2:10 am. Van
Call, a bus escort system for the evening
and early morning, will still ﬁmction
within the same boundaries.

No University bus travels further
then Moorewood Avenue in North
Oakland, past Craft Avenue in Oakland,
or past the Biotech building in South
Oakland. The bus that goes to Chatham

College will no longer stop on Fifth.
, Avenue.

The fact that Pitt shuttles operate
side—by-side with Port Authority buses is
not a problem, according to Harkins, who
said there is no competition between Pitt
and the Port Authority. -

“This year is an evaluation period for
with PAT, but we haven’t seen anything
astonishing the ﬁrst week of school with

the Oakland shuttles,” Harkins said. “If .

we have less ridership somewhere we’d
modify it for some where else.”

A smaller adjustment, but one just as
helpful, is the new shuttle-bus map.
Instead of having each bus schedule on a
separate sheet ‘ of paper,
Transportation Department made one
booklet with additional times, phone
numbers and Port Authority information.
Students can get the maps at the informa-
tion desk in the Wﬂharn Pitt Union. .

Correction: The Pitt. News. reported in Tuesday's edition that the‘
Carnegie Museum used to print 4,000,000 passes that students could
buy. The museum used to print 400,000 passes.

BAS event aims to help minori
students succeed in college

Christal Hall
V Staff Writer

The Black Action Society will
hold its 30th annual Indaba
Celebration Friday to help freshmen
learn to avoid falling into traps that
plague many minority students.

The Indaba is an informal rap ses-
sion where African Americans can
come together to talk about issues that
can inﬂuence their academic success,
according to Shavon Ogunleye, BAS
president.

“We’re going to talk about both
the positive and negative things to
expect on the Pitt campus,” she said.

Ogunleye said that she and BAS
vice president Esrick O. McCartha
will give .we1coming speeches in
which they will dispel all stigmas
about BAS. '

“BAS is willing to help increase
retention and recruitment among the
African American community——not
only to freshmen, but to sophomores,
juniors and seniors too,” Ogunleye
said.

She said that she wants the fresh-
men to feel like Pitt is a homeaway
from home.

Ogunleye said the first Indaba, in
1968, was designed to help minority

p freshmen adapt to campus life by hav-
ing older students and alumni talk.

about their experiences at Pitt.

“The older students can tell the
younger students which classes and
teachers to take and not to take,”
Ogunleye said. “Like a big brother/big
sister type of arrangement.”

Ogunleye said the theme of this
year’s event, “Level One: Avoiding
the traps,” is in conjunction with the
BAS’s theme: “Advancement through
enhancement; taking you to another

level....” A

“This year’s theme is meant to
take the African American community
one step higher than it was last year,
and as the years progress the level of
improvement will get higher and high-
er,” Ogunleye said. _

‘She said she hopes this year’s
Indaba helps Pitt’s African American
community unite.

“I want students to know that they
can come to BAS for everything—like
we’re an information station,”
Ogunleye said.

She said she hopes to see young
leaders emerge from the event.

“Once Esrick and I leave, we’ll
need new leaders, and the freshmen
are going to be our future leaders,”
Ogunleye said. ' i .

She added that she wants students
to know what the BAS is really about,
and that she wants BAS to» be assess-
able toall students. ,

“We have a 13-member steering
committee that is working’ hard every-
day to see that their goals and their
future dreams come true,” Ogunleye
said.

Indaba will be held‘ 7 to 10:30 p.m.
Friday in the Ballroom of the William
Pitt.Union. From 10:30 p.m. to 2:30
a.m, there will be an after—party for the
students who attended.

Ogunleye said the keynote speaker
will be Lynnewood Harrisjformer res-
ident director of Lothrop Hall. Harris
will talk about the .traps that many
African American students fall into.

Other speakers will be_ Darryl
Wiley and Justin Lang‘ of the African
American Cultural Center. Natalie
Solomon of the Blood Bank will also
give a lecture on donating blood, and

'theBlack Dance Workshop will per-

form.

Binge drinking death forces changes at MIT

James Y. Stern

Harvard crimson

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (U—WIRE)
— Last fall, MIT made national
headlines when a first-year student
died from binge drinking at a cam-
pus fraternity party. I

His fraternity brothers allegedly
left him in the basement to choke on
his own vomit, and the family is
threatening to sue.

This year, the elite science and
technology school is taking drastic
steps to prevent another tragedy.

In a letter this summer announc-
ing the most drastic in a series of
changes, MIT President Charles M.
Vest said that in the fall of 2001 all
first-year students would be housed
on campus.

For the nearly 2,000 MIT under-
graduates who participate in the
school’s Greek system, the death of
Scott Krueger has meant a dramatic
change in their residential lives.

Before" Krueger’s death, says
Iido Gilon —— who presided over the
MIT’s Inter-fraternity‘ Council last
year — “fraternity life was very
social and a lot of fun. Very upbeat.”

But Gilon says that is no longer
the case. Pressure from the MIT
administration, in the form of disci-
plinary action, has reshaped Greek

life at MIT. Students live in fear that
they will suffer the

consequences for the actions of a
few.

“Students have become aware
they have to become a lot more
careful,” Gilon says.

MIT now finds itself struggling
to redefine how students will live
and spend their time with a residen-
tial system that has a cherished his-
tory but a reputation for disaster.

Fraternities don’t know how
they will revamp the pledging
process, but they are guaranteed a
significant drop in income. It is
possible first-years, no longer
driven to fraternities for lack
of campus housing, might
choose never to pledge.

Vest’s housing plan
will go into effect as
soon as MIT’s new -:
$25 million dormito-
ry is completed. The
building will hold up
to 350 students.

Vest said the new
housing system was
part of the MIT’s
desire to “enhanc[e]

The MIT president chose his
words carefully, recalling‘ the vision
outlined by his own Task Force on
Student Life and Learning.

Now a cliche among MIT
reformers, the “educational triad” of
education, research and community
is a battle cry for a more integrated
academic and social life — ending
the traditional divide between frat
and classroom.

Police suspect foul play in death of priest who stole $1 million

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

PITTSBURGH Allegheny
County Police are investigating the
possibility of foul play in the death
of a priest accused of stealing more
than a million dollars from two
parishes. County Police
Superintendent Thomas Sturgeon
says a man and a woman were seen
in the Rev. Walter Benz’s room
night at a suburban
Pittsburgh nursing home. A nurse
responded to an alarm that Benz’s
IV had been pulled out.

’ WASHINGTON — With the inde-

pendent counsel’s report expected
in the next two weeks, President
Clinton is reaching out to Congress.
He invited Democratic Party leaders
in.the House for a private session

yesterday and plans to meet House

and Senate leaders from both parties
today. ' '

White House spokesman Mike
McCurry acknowledged a major
topic is likely to be the independent
counsel’s report on the president’s
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

That issue has caused some
democrats to distance _themselves
from the president. Maryland Gov.
Parris Glendening decided to stay
away from a.Clinton school event

yesterday, and he’s canceled an
October fund-raiser with the presi-
dent. _

McCurry said the governor is
entitled to his opinion, and added
Clinton “probably understands the
way the governor feels.”

WASHINGTON — Democrats may
be in some trouble come November.
A new poll suggests the gender gap
has almost been wiped out. ‘It finds
Democrats with only a four-point
lead among women, while
Republicans have a 12-point lead
among men.

Support 0 among women has
worked in the Democrats’ favor in
recent years.

The bipartisan “Battleground
1998” poll_suggests that Democratic
voters are so disheartened by
President Clinton and the Monica
Lewinsky case that they just might
stay home on election day. And that
could help Republicans in some ‘key
races for Congress.

It took Feinberg more than nine

THE P111 NEws

WEDNESDAY, 9 SEPTEMBER 1998

Bovcorr

employees in his classes, engineer-
ing professor James Cobb was the
only member to vote against the
proposal.

Nabisco will close its plant on
Penn Avenue in East Liberty by
Nov. 20, putting 350 people out of
work. The Pittsburgh plant is the
company’s oldest and smallest oper-
ation.

Despite the wide margin by
which the measure passed, some
members of the assembly voiced
concerns about the boycott’s effec-
tiveness.

“Unless it’s a nationwide boy-
cott, I don’t think it’s going to make
a difference,” said Ann Sutherland
Harris, a professor of art history.
“Nabisco makes a lot of awfully
popular products.”

Mike Gumpert, Nabisco‘ issues
coordinator for the East End
Neighborhood Forum, said commu-
nity groups fighting the plant clo-
sure hope Pittsburgh will be the first
part of a wider-ranging boycott
effort.

“We hope to use Pittsburgh as a
springboard to other cities,” he said.
Nabisco is also losing plants in

FROM PAGE 1

Buena Park, ’Calif., Houstonand

Philadelphia, and Gumpert said he
hopes to see residents of those cities
start similar boycotts.

Gumpert, a Pitt alumnus, said he
knows some people at Pitt will still
buy Nabisco products, but he feels a
boycott can still be successful.

Nabisco talked about closing the’

East Liberty plant in 1982," but
threats of a boycott —— in conjunc-
tion with an agreement that workers
would boost productivity — helped
keep the plant open.

A boycott could also tarnish

Nabisco’s reputation, Gumpert said,
“especially when [parent company
RJ Reynolds] has serious tobacco
litigation it’s facing right now.”

To coincide with the boycott,
Gumpert said community groups
hope to plead their case before
Nabisco’s board of directors and are
trying to find a buyer for the plant.

History professor Van Beck Hall
agreed the boycott may not be com-
pletely effective but said that the
University should take a stand on
the issue.

“I think it’s an action we have to ,

take to defend our communities, our
city from actions of this type,
because if we don’t, actions of this
type will continue,” he said.
Nabisco said it will transfer pro-
duction of Chips Ahoy cookies and
Ritz Bits crackers from Pittsburgh,
the company’s most efficient plant,
to Atlanta, its least efficient plant.
In the process, equipment from
the East Liberty facility will tem-
porarily be used at a co-packing
plant in Ohio, where several compa-
nies combine operations, while the
Atlanta facility is prepared for extra

production. The Ohio plant is

staffed by non—union personnel.

Gumpert said he sees such a
move as a sure sign of corporate
greed.

“Co-packing plants are corpo-
rate America’s opportunity to cut
costs rather than ship [perishable
ingredients] to third-world countries
for processing,” he said.

Gumpert said he doubts the
equipment from Pittsburgh will ever
leave the Ohio plantbecause labor
there is so much cheaper than a
unionized facility.

“We think they’re lying,” he
said of Nabisco’s intentions. “This
has been their pattern, to shift to
non-union employment.”

PHEAA

in all its glory yesterday as students
filed in and out of Bruce Hall with-
out a break amid the incessant ring
of phones. ’

In between questions about work
study and the types of state aid avail-
able, Kim Buckwalter, loan coordi-
nator in Pitt’s financial aid office,
said the trick is getting students to
know about the website.

“It’s super-easy, super-friendly,”
Buckwalter said about the updated
site. “Even someone who doesn’t
have too much experience with the
computer and the Internet can use
it.”

Logging onto the site, students
can click on a tab entitled “students
and parents” to access information
on managing student loans, project-
ing the growth of their savings and
finding answers to frequently asked
questions such as when the right
time is to start repaying loans.
Visitors can search a national data-
base on scholarship information,
which has links to other reliable
sites.‘

FROM PAGE 1

The site also provides a glossary .

of financial aid terms and the ability
to download software programs and
various financial aid or loan docu-
ments — a help to the half a million
students in the tri-state area who
secured loans last year.

In Pennsylvania alone, 152,000
students secured $240 million in gift
aid from the state grant program last
year, with another 350,000 getting
Stafford loans from the federal gov-
ernment. _

New hopes the website will fun-
nel some of these frantic students
away from the phone lines and onto
the computer, a desire Buckwalter
also shares.

But she said the website will not
help everyone. .

“We can actually tell students
quicker than PHEAA about loan sta-
tus since we have to approve the
loan,” Buckwalter said. “So, for stu-
dents who need to know right away
(Pitt’s financial aid office) would be
the place to come.” _

She also said most financial aid
applications are turned in with errors
or questions and sometimes it’s easi-
er to get the answers from a person
than to search for them on a website.

“Students have to know when it
would be helpful to log on to the site

and when it wouldn’t be useful,”

Buckwalter said. “A lot of it has to
do with when the application was
received by PHEAA. We don’t want
to frustrate the students more.”

Loan counseling via the Internet,
however, is now available and is set
to become one of the site’s most
popular uses, New said. Students can
access it at their leisure where before
they were required to attend a face to
face session with a ﬁnancial aid
administrator prior to obtaining a
federal or state loan.

“With this technology we have a
responsibility to do as much as we
can to help the students,” New said.

To PHEAA this means updating
the site as needs arise and enhancing
the appearance once every year.

“It’s a stellar decision on the part
of PHEAA to put information like
this on the web,” said Flora
Sweeney, director -of Pitt’s student
association, which lobbies at the fed-
eral and state levels on issues affect-
ing college students. “Many students
don’t know about the aid that’s
available and some don’t go to
school because they don’t think they
have the money to go. Maybe this
website will convince them other-
wise.”

“It’s kind of boring.” L
Freshman Phu Nguyen
agreed he had too much
free time and he expressed
his disappointment with the
weekend activities.

“Parties are too crowd-
ed and hot,-” he said.

Many students praised
Pitt’s urban environment.
Nguyen commented on the
metropolitan campus.

“It ‘s a city atmosphere,
but it doesn’t feel like it,”
he said. “The people are so
nice. I really like the fact
that we have free bus ser-
vice too.”

Anderson, who is origi-
nally from Washington,
D.C., echoed Nugyen’s
comments. '

“It is so different from
D.C.,” she said. “The peo-
ple are so_ nice and willing
to help you.”

Some students, like
freshman engineering stu-
dent Josh Lindsey, had,pos—
itive first impressions of
Pitt.

“I love it,” Lindsey

said. “There is always stuff .

to do, and_ the work isn’t as
hard as I expected. I want
to join clubs: skydiving,
kickboxing, young democ-
rats. I am really trying to
get . a good education,”
Lindsey said.

Other students were not

-as sure of their goals as

Lindsey. Erica Lauris
decided to give herself
some time to sort out her
goals.

“I am here to figure out

what I want to do with my
life. I want to find out
what I enjoy doing,” she
said.

Students expected col-
lege to be a time when they
achieved the milestones of
their lives, such as attain-
ing a degree, a better sense
of themselves, a strong
peer group and, in some
cases, a spouse.

Anderson said she
thought she would meet her
future husband in college.

Other students didn’t
take that notion so serious-
ly, and were more reluctant
to make‘ such an assertion.

When asked the same
question, many students
replied that ‘ they hadn’t
thought about it at all.
Others, like Phu Nguyen
simply replied, “Maybe.”

A Images of Yeltsin scrambling  

after McGwire’s record homer

It’s ﬁnally happened: Mark
McGwire got his 62nd home rim and
broke Roger Maris’ record last night
at Busch Stadium. Before the game,
there was a lot of talk about what the
fan who caught the ball would do
with it, with budding capitalists say-
ing that they would sell it for $1 mil-
lion or more.

With Russia’s economic and
political crisis deepening and with
the International Monetary Fund
insisting that they stay on the rocky
capitalist road, why not charmel this
capitalist baseball spirit directly into
Russia’s depleted coffers?

Consider this for a scenario:

Russia is a nation of the vodka,
by the‘vodka and for the vodka. In an
effort to promote beer overseas,
Anheuser-Busch invites Russian
President Boris Yeltsin over on a pro-
motional tour. (The Russian
Parliament keeps rejecting Yeltsin’s
nomination of Vrktor Chemomyrdin
as Premier because it was V1ktor’s
suggestion that they go with
American beer and not Irish beer.)

On Sept. 8, Yeltsin’s Anheuser-
Busch delegation stops in St. Louis
to inspect the region’s ale (in order to
try generate wealth in the capitalist
spirit and prevent a communist resur-
gence, fresh inebriants must be intro-
duced into the Russian economy). As
part of the trip, Yeltsin is given a seat
in the bleachers near the storage area

behind the home rim wall (as a lesson
to Yeltsin, in a free market, those with
money get to sit in luxury boxes).
Throughout the game, Yeltsin
chugs down beers (on top of the St.
Ides he acquired earlier that day in a
trip to Fayette County, Pa.), until the

- fourth inning when the ball is sud-

denly hit by McGwire in his direc-
tion. Yeltsin, unable’ to judge distance
in his condition, leaps to the side and
attempts to grab the ball, but falls
over the railing. Landing with a
thump and looking around, he real-
izes that he has just earned himself a
$1 million ball. His secret service
police run to his aid, and he runs
from Busch Stadium with the ball,
hops on a plane and escapes back to
Moscow.

Meanwhile, American fans are
desperate to get the ball back. But
Yeltsin, having learned from his cap-
italist American experience decides
to up the price of the ball to $10 mil-
lion. Outrage ensues.

However, this scenario did not
occur (except Yeltsin’s drinking).
McGwire got his ball back, and
Russia is still in ﬁnancial disarray.
The value of the $1 million ball
plummeted like stocks on Wall Street
did last week, and Chemomyrdin is
still not liked by Russian Parliament

The capitalist system may be
best for baseball, but the same can’t
be said for Russia ‘

Right now I can only imagine the amount

of perverse joy I’m going to get out of saying,
“Man, capitalism just doesn’t work; look what
happened in Russia.” N o doubt the ideologues
will then respond with pieties about the need
for a “long and difﬁcult transition period” —
in which the “remnants of the discredited old
regime” have to be “ruthlessly purged” —
before we reach the lofty paradise of “full cap-
italism.” Although it will accomplish little, this
polemic promises to be vastly entertaining.
The confusion affecting the partisans of “actu-
ally existing capitalism” is proof—positive of
the adage that the ironies of history occur most
pungently to those who don’t believe in them.

While on the subject of irony, consider the
case of one Osarna Bin
Laden, who was among
those dubbed “Afghan ,_"
freedom ﬁghters” by the ’
CLA during_ the 1980s. ' n
Bin Laden is as violent
and brutal as ever in his
pursuit of a theocratic
reactionary utopia; it’s
just that lately he’s
switched targets. By
doing so, he has earned
the enmity of Wﬂliarn
Jefferson ‘Clinton, who
has denounced Bin Laden for “cloaking terror
in the guise of righteousness.” I scarcely need
to repeat the clichés about pots calling kettles
black, not to mention dogs biting the hands
that feed them. .

The mainstream media were par for the
course in failing to bring up any of the ftmda—
mental’ issues surrounding the U.S. attacks on
Bin -Laden’s camps in Afghanistan and on a
civilian pharmaceutical facility in’ Sudan.
Discussion of the topic was conﬁned to the
inane controversy over whether Clinton may
have timed the attack to distract attention from
his sex scandals; to a man,6 every hack com-
mentator of the major media accepted without
protest the right of the U.S. to unilaterally
bomb targets in two sovereign countries with-
out even bothering to consult the United
Nations. (And this from journalists who no
doubt would have ridiculed the crude propa-
ganda of Pravda during the Soviet attack on
Afghanistan 18 years . ago.) Certainly, none
bothered to point out that if the U.S. has the
right to attack “terrorist training camps” in

other countries, then Cuba, for example,
would therefore have the right to bomb

 The onanistic fascination with the‘
, chief executive_’s sexual escapades was an

unorthodox way to conﬁne public discussion
within acceptable parameters; nevertheless, it
worked well.

The London Observer has reported that
the United States knew that the Sudanese facil-
ity was civilian when it attacked. Whether it
was or not, the U.S. has asserted its right to
bomb anything it sees ﬁt if it has deemed that
the_target in question is a -“cherr1ical weapons
facility.” In other words, the United States. is
preparing for its next target, which is Iraq.
When things start to heat up, look for the more
orthodox method of constricting public

winger will say, in

ly need to do is bomb
country X and kill a
few thousand people.”
Some liberal will then
reply, in effect, f‘Gee,
that sounds great; .I’m
just not sure we can
pull it off.”

Our local liberals
have been hard at
work lately. The Pitt News, reliably liberal on
matters from race to homosexuality to
'women’s rights, weighed in with a Sept. 3 edi-
torial against the Nabisco boycott This is not
very different from the attitude of liberals
nationwide, who loudly declare their distaste
for Rush Limbaugh, the religious right and
Newt Gingrich but always end up saying
essentially the same thing as the right: We all
must assume the fellatio position toward glob-
al capital.

. This statement from the editorial in ques-
tion is worthy ' of . . . er, a Nabisco intern:
“Rather than fretting over 348 lost jobs, the
residents of Pittsburgh should cheer the arrival
of 10 times more.” This is a dichotomy whose
brilliance is no doubt lost on the 348 people
whom Nabisco has laid off. Perhaps what The
Pitt News is trying to say, essentially, is, “If
you don’t like it, go to Russia.”

Fascinating women in politics:
Phoolan Devi, Margaret Thatcher,
Sarah Michelle Gellar.

No, your eyes are not deceiving
you. Buffy the Vampire Slayer herself is
one of the 20 most fascinating women
in politics, at least according to the
September ‘98 issue of George maga-
zine (Noticeably, none of the two other
women I mentioned are included, prob-
ably because they don’t look good in
Guess Jeans.).

“[She] represents real girl power,

the kind that can kung—fu the undead

back into oblivion,” writes Debbie
Stoller. “Seen in this light, Gellar, who
also fought good fights in horror ﬂicks
like “Scream 2” and “I Know What You
Did Last Summer,” might just be what

the doctor ordered [for girls’ plummet-A

ing self—esteem]. She’s a heroine who’s
tough as nails — sparkly blue ones at
that.” _ _

. George -— the political magazine
for people who don’t like politics, as
“The Daily Show’-’ puts it 4- is further
blurring of the boundaries between pol-

itics and celebrities. While I admire

Sarah Michelle Gellar, and all she has

. . done to make my trip to the cinema

worthwhile, I hardly View her as a polit-
ical ﬁgure. Fascinating, yes. A political
tour de force, no.

Though I won’t go so far as to
describe her as my one libidinous friend
does (“an ass-kicking piece of ass”),
Gellar does attract huge amounts of fas-
cination. (Oddly enough from men — I

to do with politics. Judging by
some of the other suggestions
offered by the magazine’s con-
tributors, George seems to take
this list seriously. Gellar is
offered up along-side Elizabeth
Dole, author Lisa Palac, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, New York Taxi

that the accompanying piece is written

writer yet?). Though she has every right
to be on a top—20 list of dominant
female politicians,’ George should’ve
found someone other than her husband
to write a piece about her. What was
Bob’»s motive anyway? Since he’s been
on Viagra, does he need to soften her up
so she can give him more sex?

The piece on Monica Lewinsky is
written by none—other than embarass-
ment-of-the-’80s Patty Reagan Davis.
For all she has to say about the presi-
dent’s fascinating (if I were president,
I’d go for an intern who looked like
Sarah Michelle Gellar) semen recepta-
cle, I suspect that there is some jeal-
ousy. Davis might be asking herself,
“now why couldn’t I have caused so
much of a stir?”

So with these people in mind, I pre-
sent to you The Pitt News 20 most fas-
cinating people in politics (past and
contemporary): —

Patrick Swayze, Katie Holmes,
Michael Jordan, Maurice Chevalier,
Fyodor Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad,
John Milton, Treat Williams, Fabienne
Barthez, Nelson Mandela, Tamerlane,
Ron Jeremy, Friedrich Engels, Viktor
Chemomyrdin, Waqar Younis, Michael
Atherton, Benjamin Disraeli, Harold
Wilson, Margaret Thatcher and Randy
Travis.

Make any sense? Of course it does.

ical list compilations as the editors of

Last Thursday, the cable in my apart-
ment was shut off. I’d been getting it free for
a while, and then suddenly, it was gone. I
crossed my ﬁngers as my apartment-mate
hooked up the antenna he’d somehow
acquired last year, one that looked some-
thing like a cross between a portable ham-
burger grill and a piece of modern art.
Maybe, I hoped, we’d get all four of the

» major networks. Maybe we’ d even get UPN

or WB or whatever it is Channel 22 is call-
ing itself these days. That would have been
broadcast television nirvana. But it wasn’t to
be. When all of the ﬁddling was over, only
one of those channels, WXPI (Charmel 11),
was serni-clear. ~

(It’s unimportant to note that, with
some antenna ﬁddling, we do also get VCC,
the knife-and-gemstone-peddling Video
Catalogue Channel, and The Box, the poor-

man’s MTV, which plays on average one

complete music video every two hours. We
also get PBS, inexplicably on two channels.
PBS is good primarily for the Orwellian

brain-mush that is “’I‘eletubbies,” which airs
weekdays at 11:00 am.)

I had the misfortime Sunday night of
catching the ﬁrst two hours of the 33rd
annual Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy
Association Telethon on our lone real chan-
nel, WPXI. Jerry was there, and so was his
good friend Ed McMahon, as well as a
smattering of other Hollywood personalities
and the audience, of course.

The audience. I confess that I don’t
know the ins and outs of the Jerry Lewis
telethon; I’ve never watched a making-of-
tl1e—telethon special, but it seems to me that
the whole affair is broadcast live. That
seems like the only logical way to do it, con-
sidering all the updates of the grand total
and all. '

But what about the audience? Does a
new audience replace the old one every sev-
eral hours, or are the audience members
locked in the studio for the duration of the
telethon? If so, when do they eat and drink?

When do they go to the bathroom? One.

more audience question: Are the audience
members paid to clap enthusiastically with
each new update of the grand total and

laugh‘ hysterically at unfunny comedian
after unfunny comedian?kI doubt it. That
means they must have very big hearts
and/or very comfortable chairs. Or they
must be masochists. Or they must be very
easily entertained. -

I, for one, am not easily entertained But
it was late, and having already read my
roommates’ Playboy, Pontiac and Glamour
magazines cover to cover, ‘and being as
American as fake cappuccino, I had

absolutely, positively nothing’ better to do _

than watch television. Nothing better to do
than watch my lone channel.

Sunday night, I wanted more than any-
thing else to be a Bill Gates-caliber billion-
aire. I wanted to call the telethon’s donation
hotline and donate $1 billion to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association on the
condition that the whole horrible alfair be
called off.

Jerry would have obliged He would
have been thrilled, I’m sure. Finally, after 32
years, he would actually have had a chance
to sit .back and enjoy the day oif that is
Labor Day. Maybe he would have done
something crazy like go to the Hollywood

long, long way

wave pool with his good friend Ed. And I
would have been a hero twice over. The bil-
lion dollars would have gone a long way
toward ﬁnding a cure for muscular dystro-
phy (Jerry’s~cause is as noble as his telethon
is aggravating). -

And I also would have_saved all the
poor souls in the United States whose only
unfuzzy channel was taken over by Jerry
Lewis (cable expensive, and the cable
guys are nmning about two months behind,
anyway) the misery of having to sit through
a whole day of . family—friendly stand-up

"comedy, telephone numbers, drum rolls and

false kindness. A wonderful dream indeed.

Another semi-related dream of mine is
to give the pitiful, acoustic-guitar—playing
street performer that frequents the
Oaldand/Squirrel Hill sidewalks a $1000
bill on the condition that he stops playing
“Knockin’ on Heavenfs Door,” packs up his
things’, and goes home for the day.

But I don’t have $1000. I don’t even
have cable.

Bible not sexist and should not he used for sexist agendas

Ramesh

Reddy .
This past summer, the Southern Baptist
Convention decreed in Salt Lake City that
“wife shouldsubmit graciously to her hus-
band.” There have been opinions eolinnns in
major newspapers by Southern Baptists reit-

erating this. V

Theirdefenseisthattheyarejustfol-.

lowing the Bible. In writing, the worst trav-
esty ofjustice is when anything is taken out
of context, or as journalists call it, when the
sin of omission is committed It is committed
when one side leaves out pertinent facts from
the other side to make their own side favor-
able. '

This is exactly how I felt about this
issue. It is right in saying that Genesis 3:16
says “and thy desire shall be to thy husband,’
and he shall .rule over thee,”- and that
Ephesians 5:22 says, “VV1ves, submit to your
husbands as to the Lord”

However, critics of Southern Baptists
err when they say the Bible is in favor of sex-
ism. By omitting important scripture from
the Bible, they dissuade anyone from believ-
ing that God or his-wordis not sexist.

Ephesians 6:21 says, “Submit to one
another out of reverence for Christ.” This

verse states that wives and husbands should
submit to each other and should be in an
equal partnership, with Christ being the cen-
ter.

Husbands who feel they are superior to
their wives may point to Ephesians 5:21-24,
which says, “VV1ves submit to your husbands
as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of
the wife, as Christ is the head of the church,
his body of which he is the Savior. Now as
the church submits to Christ, so also wives
should’ submit to their husbands in. every-
mg’),

If we -relied just on the previous, verses,
it would seem that the Bible is blatantly sex-
ist in its view of married women.

Ephesians 5:25 says, “Husbands love
your wives, just as Christ loved the Church
and gave himself for her.”

Wives are told to submit to husbands,
and husbands are told to love their wives.
Love gives submission a whole new mean-
mg. . -
' One Corinthians 13:4-7 says, “Love is
patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does

not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is .

not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it
keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not
delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It
always protects, always trusts, always hopes,

always perseveres.”

Men who use the Bible to think they are
on a pedestal when it corrres to their place in
the maniage contract, are extracting parts of
the Bible at their own convenience.

If this argument does not dispel any-
one’s view, including the Baptists, take this
to mind: It is true that while in Genesis we
read “and thy desire should be to your hus-
band and he shall rule over thee,” God gave
this edict as a consequence of sin because it
was‘ Eve who ﬁrst disobeyed God and
tempted Adam to disobey God. Adam even-
tually gave into temptation and into Eve.
However, both were ruled because of their
individual shortcomings.

Judges 424,8-9 says, “At that time
Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth,
was judging Israel. Barak said to her, ‘If you
will go with me, Iwill go; butifyouwillnot
go with me, I will not go.’ And she said, -‘I
will smely go with you; nevertheless, the
road on which you are going will not lead
you to glory, for the Lord will sell Sisera into
the hand of a woman.’” , .

V This instance doesn’t involve a hus-
band-wife relationship, but Barak, a high-
ranking military oﬂicer, takes orders from
Deborah, a female judge of Israel

Tmsmanisnotevenwillingtotakea

step unless Deborah accompanies him. She
tellshimthehand ofawomanwillbring the
enemy down. There are numerous dominant
female ﬁgures in the Bible, and worrren have
been biblical leaders, too. God’s appoint-
ment of judges was hardly sexist
_Letusremembereverymanthathas
come into the world would not be here if a
woman did not bear him in her womb at one
time. God gave that responsibility to women,

and it’s not up to women to say, “well, I did .

not ask God for that responsibility.”

Women, it was given to you, and it’s up
to you what you do with that responsibility.
But with every choice we make we have to
face the results of those choices.

Every feminist who believes God is
sexist and the Bible is sexist should read the
entire Bible before making a judgement
based on hearsay.

And chauvinists who believe that they
alone should be in control of their wives
should also read the entire Bible carefully.

A relationship is a two-way street,
where love gives “submission” and
‘inequality?’ a whole new meaning, with
Christ being in the center. .

Ramesh Reddy believes there is more to the
‘Bible than meets the eye.

 

Villao s Pitt’s
p warning shot

Matt Lytle spoke the Panther party line

-perfectly Saturday evening.
. At the post—game press conference, .
Lytle sat at the from table, stared at the array

of cameras, and said 

 and I quote 

“A win’s a win.” »

Lytle threw four touchdown pas
before he uttered that phrase. He read the
Vrllanova defense well all game. He used
receivers that some fans didn’t know Pitt
had on the roster. He showed leadership, tal-
ent and poise. V T

So one should not be quick to criticize.
Especially not one like yours truly, who
thinks Lytle has a chance to be a better quar-
terback than Pete Gonzalez. And not just
because he’s left—handed, like most talented
people. . ‘ _
But in this instance, Matt Lytle is
wrong. And the Panther fans who agree with
him are wrong.

This win was not just a win.

This win was a warning.

In the old movie Westerns," the bad guy
would ride into town early in the picture and
stare down the sheriff. He would ﬁre his
guns a few times, make lewd remarks at the

townfolk, and threaten to pretty much kill '

everybody.
After his speech, he would ﬁre a single
bullet.

_ Sometimes it hit the sheriff ’s hat.
Sometimes it hit the wall. Sometimes it hit a
bucket or a bottle above the bar, which was
always ﬁlled with something and always
emptied onto some hapless character—actor
standing in the corner.

It was a warning shot.

The Panthers got one Saturday. They _

were just lucky that V1llanova’s aim was a
tad off, or the season might be dead already.

Now, with 10 days to prepare for a
N ittany Lion onslaught, Pitt has to circle the
wagons and address the two glaring prob-
lems that allowed Villanova to reload ‘multi-

After a scoreless double—over-
time draw with Duquesne
University on ‘Friday, Pitt’s Reagan
Bender had two goals and an assist
to lead the Panthers to a 3-0 shutout
over the Quinniapiac Braves on
Sunday.

In. the match with Duquesne, the
Panthers held the Dukes to only two
‘shots through regulation and both
overtime periods, but they couldn’t
capitalize on their own 20 shots.

Friday’s ' scoreless contest
sparked a'change in the Panthers’
offensive attack. _

Coach Joe Luxbacher decided to
run the offense with three forwards
instead of the two‘ he’d used in the
previous matches. _

.“On Friday we weren’t finishing
chances. [Sunday] we finished our
chances; we put ‘three up front
instead,” said Luxbacher.

For The Pltt News

The Pitt Panthers are off to a
good start V after beating the
Villanova Wildcats, but the team
received little support from its
special teams.

Head coach Walt Harris was
pleased with the kickoff returns,
but he still thinks there is work to
be done. The players are now
more aware of what to expect in a
game situation. The Panthers
could have contained Brian
Westbrook better, but overall
they had a good day.

Pitt’s first touchdown was.

scored by Kevan Barlow with
6:56 to go in the first quarter.
Paul Ruzila nailed the extra point
to give Pitt a 7-0 lead.

After this score, Nick Lotz
booted a 58-yard kickoff that was
returned for 29 yards to the
Villanova 36-yard line.

Matt Lytle completed a pass
to Latef Grim for a touchdown
after an interception, making the
score 13-0. Ruzila attempted the
extra point and missed, showing
the beginning of Pitt’s special
teams woes. ‘ ‘

After the second touchdown,
Lotz kicked the ball 61 yards, and
Villanova returned it 41 yards.

—Westbrook then ran 48 yards,

leading to a Villanova touch-
down. Casey Hannon nailed the
extra point to make the score 13-
7.

Villanova kicker Chip Ashby,
had an impressive 56-yard kick-
off with a 12-yard return after the
Wildcats’ first touchdown.

Villanova had yet another
good series of passes after Pitt’s
offense sputtered and was forced
to punt. On the .50-yard punt by
Greg DeBolt, Westbrook had a
25-yard return.

Westbrook took a 15-yard
touchdown pass, and Hannon’s
extra point was good to make the
score 14-13 in Villanova’s favor.

The Panthers’ Hank Poteat
ran the ball back 16 yards on the
Villanova kickoff. After Pitt’s
offense was forced to punt again,
Westbrook r-acked up 10 more
yards on the return. . '1

Lytle’s pass;J;o_Bar1ovt_g;j__s'cored
a 60-yard touchdown, angtslijuzila
added the extfa point tof‘;?‘g‘1,_ve, the

again Ruzila’s point is good,
making the score at halftime 27-
20 in Pitt’s favor.

After the Panthers scored
early in the third quarter,
Westbrook came right back with
an 89-yard kick return for a
touchdown. Hannon’s extra-point
attempt was blocked by the
Panther defense.

The special teams had a dis-
mal day with all of the mistakes.
To add to the kicking mistakes
and the returns, Villanova had a

fake punt that turned into a
touchdown.

The fake punt could have
deﬂated the Panthers and taken
them right out of the game, but

Pitt stayed alive with strong play‘

from the offense and the defense.

Overall, Harris was pleased
with the way the team played, but
there is still room for improve-
ment. The Panthers have an off
week so they can practice and
prepare to play Penn State in two
weeks. 6 '

‘ If you’ve ever seen “Forrest Gump”. or
the Energizer Bunny commercials, you can
relate to the University of PitIsburgh’s cross-
country team. It just keeps running and rum-
ning and nmning. , , ' p

Cross-country is a sport in which the
season only lasts a few months, but training
takes place year-round.

“In cross-country, there is a very direct
relationship between how well you work
and how well you do,’~’ head coach Dave
Sobal said

A runner needs to physically train, but
it’s important not to overlook the mental
aspect of running.

“It’s not so much a skill sport at all, but
more of a mentality sport,” Sobal said.

The mental aspect is easily understood,
considering it can take years to build up
one’s endurance.

The importance of endurance cannot be
underestimated in a sport where the men I'l1Il
ﬁve miles and the women run three miles
across terrains that can be less than ﬁiendly.
The surface ofacoursecanbegrass, dirtand
bark, while the path itself could go up and
down a series of hills. _

With these ldnds of hardships, the sight
of a teammate can be encouraging. And
when it comes to scoring, team effort is what
cross cotmtry is all about. Individual accom-

plishments usually go urmoticed if the team
ﬁnishes last, which is why a total team effort
is imperative.

- The women’s team this year has the
potential to be successful. Despite losing two
seniors who were team leaders, three sopho-
mores look to ﬁll these leadership voids.

“The excitement started welling up in
July and now I’m really excited about work-
ing with the women,” Sobal said “I’m excit-
ed to see people accomplish things they
haven’t accomplished before. The women
have potential to do greatthings this year.”

Like every year, the Big East looks
toughthis season.Asuccessful seasoninthe
Big East would be impressive since it is “by
far the toughest conference in NCAA for
women,” according to Sobal.

The Big East is also among the nation’s
top conferences when it comes to track and
cross country for men. According to Sobal, it
is comparable to any other conference in the
country. Unfortunately, that could spell bad
news for the men, whose team is relatively
small this year:

“If you look up “thin” hr the dictionary,
we would have a team photo there,” Sobal
said. “The men’s team has never been high
in numbers and right now we barely have
enough.” .

Although the success of both teams
doesn’t ride on early season meets, the hopes

“The level of conditioning
an athlete comes in on will
determine improvement,”
Sobal said.’ “An athlete will
never approach their limits if
they don’t have themental atti-

and believing they can.”

Despite the small numbers,
the men’s team, too, has some
potential for success.

“The team, collectively, is
working harder than anyone
else in the past four years,” said
Sobal.

Hopeﬁilly, the work will

“They are a dangerous team. I
feel we defended them well,”
Luxbacher said of Quinniapiac.

The Panthers have not given up
any goals in their first three match-
es this year. This weekend’s perfor-
mances improve their record to 2-
0-1. .

The team goes on the road
tomorrow against Robert Morris
College.

Carolina or even Temple (who, despite
reports to the contrary, would beat the living
crap out of Vllanova—they’dbe too scared

to do anything else) puts a fake punt past the '

Panthers.

Through proper preparation, this issue"

can be addressed ‘ , _

The second problem is a bit more
messy.

In front of a home crowd and against a
Division I-AA offensive line, the Panﬂier
from seven got shoved around like a prep-
school honor student lost in a mosh pit

Westbrook ran through gaping holes.
Even Phil Clarke —— a potential All—America
linebacker — was shoved out of the way on
some nmning plays and lost his battles with
Vrllanova guards on pass rushes.

Chris Boden stayed safe behind center
for almost the entire game. Pitt’s Kody

every down.

Say what you will about Penn State’s
quarte1’oack—cal1himano-talenthackora
Mike McQueary warmabe — but ifhe gets
the kind of protection that the undersized
Vrllanova line gave Boden, he’H look like
Joe Montana on Creatine supplements.

The Villanova game was a win, to be
sure. ,
But it was not a good win.
It was not an impressive win.
Itwas not“awinis awinis awin,” like
everybody else thinks it was.
It was a warning. And the Panthers will
heed it. '

_ With any luck, when Penn State rides
in, Pitt will get oﬂ the ﬁrst shot.

Then we can thank Villanova for the tar-
get practice, not for the victory.

Kevin Lilley is the senior football writer .

for The Pitt News and thinks Lytle can repeat
his four-touchdown performance against the
Nittany Lions. Hes lqi‘-handed, you know.
