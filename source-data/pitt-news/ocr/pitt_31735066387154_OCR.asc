Maya Angelou has been rec-
ognized throughout the world
as one of contemporary litera-
ture’s most inspirational poets.

A sold—out Carnegie Music
Hall crowd greeted Angelou,
who delivered a lecture last
night and inspired her audi-
ence, to say the least.

“She was the most incredi-
ble person I’ve ever listened
to,” said Pitt student Kristi
Dixon who attended the pro-
gram. “She can just talk to
everyone on every level.”

Student Monica Hiller said
she was still awed by
Angelou’s performance after it
had ended.

“I’m just stunned, and I’m
still not quite over it,” Hiller
said. “She has the ability to
penetrate my soul with words,
and not many people can do
that.”

Angelou’s primary message
throughout the night was the
importance of realizing that
one is never alone in their
struggles for a better life.
According to Angelou, poetry
can help people learn this.

“You need to know that
someone was there before.

world.

Someone was lonely before
you. Someone was neglected
and rejected before you,”
Angelou said at the Pitt
Program Council-sponsored
event. “And yet, miraculously,
that someone has survived.”

“This poetry says [life] really
is all right  you can survive,”
she said.

According to Angelou, an
important part of understand-
ing survival is learning about
the past. She encouraged stu-
dents to actively read African-
American poetry and other
forms of minority literature
which are often overlooked.

“I would discourage you
from leaving this institution of
higher education without
learning
American poetry and prose,”
she said. “There is a world of
difference between being
trained and being educated.”

Angelou said her education
in poetry at a young age
helped her find her identity
and see her importance in the

Eu reconsiders leaving Pittsburgh for Penn

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
physician Dr. Freddie H. Fu, a national fig-
ure in sports medicine, has decided to “stay
home at Pitt” one month after announcing
his decision to leave the university to
become chair of orthopedic surgery at the
University of Pennsylvania.

Fu, who is the chief of the division of
sports medicine at UPMC, said hundreds of
cards and letters from friends and patients
at Pitt made him realize he should stay in
Pittsburgh.

“I am a logical person and a very hard

worker. Going to Penn seemed like the cor-
rect move for my profession,” Fu said. “But
I guess I really didn’t consider the emotion-
al side.”

Fu, who planned to leave Pitt in
September for the position at Penn, said he
had time to reflect on the move during a
recent vacation to Europe and Turkey.

“I realized how much Pittsburgh meant to
myself and my family,” he said. According
to Fu, when he retumed from his vacation,
there were many letters and “phone calls
everyday” from prominent people, friends
and patients from Pittsburgh.

According to Fu, Pittsburgh will remain
his home because of the people.

“No matter how much power, prestige or
compensation there is for any position,” Fu
said, “I would never be able to find this
kind of caring anywhere else. Staying here
is the right thing to do.”

Fu is the director of the Pitt’s Center for
Sports Medicine and is head physician of
the Pitt Athletic Department. He was instru-
mental in establishing the sports medicine
program which has flourished at Pitt.

In an interview last month, UPMC ortho-
pedic chair James I-Iemdon credited Fu with
“playing a large part” in moving Pitt to a
national leadership position in sports medi-
cine.

Fisher
will not
appear at
hearings

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Pitt physician Dr. Bernard
Fisher, under fire for unknow-
ingly including falsified data in
a major breast cancer study, will
not be testifying today before a
congressional subcommittee as
planned.

According to the New Yorle
Times, Fisher, 75, requested to
be excused due to the physical
strain of the appearance. In his
letter, Fisher said the strain was
undue in light of his age and
distress caused by recent
events.

Fisher was expected to testify
about the lengthy delay in
his re—evaluation of the study
without flawed data and
the possibility of further falsi-
fied cases included in the
study.

This development is a further
disappointment to physicians
and patients around the country
who have been involved
in the treatment of breast
cancer through the radiation
treatment which was given
credit in the study directed by
Fisher.

Published in the New
England journal of Medicine in
1985, the study concluded radi-
ation treatment along with a
lumpectomy is just as effective
as removal of the entire breast
in certain cases of breast can-
cer.

The findings have led several
thousand women to choose the
simpler treatment of radiation
and lumpectomy.

Fisher requested administra-
tive leave as chair of the
National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project, the
group which conducted the

members bring to the organiza-

questions about President
Clinton’s health care reform

Staff Writer

After discussing health care
reform with an assistant of
Senator Harris Wofford, the
University Democrats ended
their final meeting of the_year
last night 'with the election of
new officers.

Hayes Davis was re-elected as
UD President and said he has
had “a lot of fun being presi-
dent. I look forward to doing
it again in the fall.” Davis,
a junior, said he plans to contin-
ue with the committees that

year

“lThe committees] seem to
have been fairly effective, espe-
cially in the area of public rela-
tions,” said Davis, an English
writing major and political sci-
ence minor. He said active
membership has also increased
in the past year.

Because of a voting tie, elec-
tions for vice president were
postponed. Current vice presi-
dent Greg Marchand said his
goals included structuring the
committees and following
through with ideas that new

Opponent Eric Scholtz said
increasing club membership
“will be top priority on my list.”
Scholtz said he would also like
to schedule more speakers.

Junior Laura Dennis, a politi-
cal science and sociology major,
was elected secretary, and Jon
Scott was elected treasurer. Dan
Corle was re-elected director of
public relations.

The first half of the UD’s ban-
quet last night in the William
Pitt Union focused on speaker
Chip Peters, who answered

plan and explained Wofford’s
position on the issue.

“The Senator believes the
Clinton [health care] plan is
a reasonable start,” said Peters,
a Wofford employee for one
year.

But, he said, Clinton’s plan,
though “conceptually very
easy,” is not necessarily the best
plan the nation collectively has
to offer. “Maybe it’s a little too
detailed at this point.”

Peters said any type of health
care reform must focus on six

goals: security, savings, simplic-
ity and maintenance of choice,
quality and local control. He
said Wofford wants to “stream-
line” the health care package
without losing sight of those six
objectives.

To do this, Peters said, the
senator plans to simplify and
modify certain sections of
Clinton’s package. “A lot of
solutions [Clinton] came up with
are really useful and ingenious,”
said Peters, “but they don’t nec-
essarily need to be in the health
care plan in that [fOI‘III of] minor

Festivalfeatares Latin, Carrtbean
lively S01/tn6l'S,fOOd, colorful sights

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

The smell of authentic food
and the sound of live bands
greeted those_who attended
Saturday’s Latin American and
Caribbean Folk Festival at Trees
Hall.

A wide variety of food from
Chile, Argentina, Peru, Jamaica
and other Latin American coun-
tries was available for students
to purchase.

A musical group composed of
violins, guitars and a vocalist
performed lively music while
the crowd of spectators clapped
along.

Recordings of different types
of Latin American and
Caribbean music were also
played.

The musicians also performed
traditional dances from different
countries, including a dance
which is popular at beaches on
the Venezuelan coast.

Many vendors brought goods
ranging from silver and beaded
jewelry to wool and hand-
crafts from Bolivia to the
festival. Scarves, woven purses
and belts were also available for

purchase.

A large star-shaped pinata
was featured as entertainment
for children who attended
the festival. Children also partic-
ipated in face and plate paint-
ing.

Along with food and festivity,
the festival hosted several politi-
cal and health-related groups.

The Department‘ of Health
sponsored free medical evalua-
tions to test participants for
blood pressure, cholesterol,
blood sugar, sickle cell and car-
diovascular risk.

They also made literature on
safe sex and drug abuse avail-
able in both English and
Spanish.

Political literature, brought by
the Pathfinder Bookstore, was
for sale.

“We carry a Cuban newspa-
per and The Militant which dis-
cusses different political move-
ments. We also have a lot of lit-

- erature on the women’s and

black struggles that are going
on in other countries,” said
John Cox of Pathfinder
Bookstore.

Representatives from the
Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition were
at the festival to offer literature
about the situation in Cuba and
explain the goals of the group
to festival goers.

“The Pittsburgh Cuba
Coalition is involved in a cam-
paign to get the U.S. to end
the economic embargo with
Cuba and to end travel restric-
tions that prevent ordinary citi-
zens from traveling to Cuba,”
said representative Sandi
Sherman.

“We are here to offer a differ-
ent point of view on Cuba,
and we believe that the U.S.
doesn’t have the right to eco-
nomically block and starve a
country into submission,”
Sherman added.

Fraternity, sorority

‘stride’ for charity

By Tahnee Rygielski
For The Pitt News

Pitt Greeks put on their
walking shoes this weekend.

Over 100 members of the
Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and
Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority
joined Saturday in a stride
for charity.

The Walk—a-Thon, spon-
sored by Pi Kappa Phi,
raised over $1,000 for PUSH
America.

PUSH — People
Understanding the Severely
Handicapped — America, is
a nationwide organization
established by the Pi Kappa
Phi national fraternity.

“The PUSH America orga-
nization plays a large part in
our fraternity,” said Pi Kappa
Phi member Sean Snyder,
chair of the Walk-a-Thon.
“We use this organization to
do something good for char-
ity.”

Throughout the past few
weeks, members of the fra-
ternity went door—to—door
asking Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill residents to
sponsor the walkers.

According to Snyder, the
proceeds will benefit PUSH
America’s outreach pro-
grams which aid handi-
capped children.

Pitt researchcenter issues series of
reports on three local industries

By Lauren Gavlak
For The Pitt News

The University Center
for Social and Urban Research
at Pitt issued a series of re-
ports last month stating that a
permanent Regional Develop-
ment Planning organization
in Pittsburgh could in-
crease productivity and
employment in three area
industries.

Ralph Bangs, a research asso-
ciate at UCSUR, targeted phar-
maceuticals and chemical pro-
duction, water and sanitation

services and air transportation
and aircraft equipment manu-
facturing to benefit from a
regional development plan for
two reasons.

They were picked because
they are already in place in
Pittsburgh and show the most
promising opportunities for
future growth in both produc-
tivity and employment.

As part of the blueprint for a
Regional Planning
Organization, UCSUR has out-
lined a structure for the organi-

zation which will center on

increasing jobs and income in

the Pittsburgh region.

The reports, the result of a
year-long study sponsored by
the Allegheny County Planning
Department, were compiled by
Bangs and regional economist
Jake Haulk.

“After ayear of work involv-
ing 59 interviews with develop-
ment experts in the region,
analysis of industry data
and case studies on develop-
ment organizations and strate-
gies in other regions, we have
concluded that the region
should have a development
organization to coordinate
strategies, and it should focus
those strategies on the three
recommended industry
groups,” said Bangs.

In preparation for their
report, the researchers conduct-
ed interviews with industry offi-
cials and key decision makers
in the Pittsburgh area who are
concerned about regional
development.

According to the UCSUR,
one goal of a Regional Plan-
ning Organization Would be not
only to keep more jobs in

more jobs and higher incomes

Angelou

Continued from page 1

“When I embodied poetry
[and] when I let it begin to seep
into me, it began to straighten
me up,” Angelou said. “It
allowed me to see that I was a
member of the human race.”

Angelou also recognized Pitt
professor Dennis Brutus’ work
as an important part of contem-
porary American poetry.

“I am delighted to be in his
presence,” Angelou said. “The
people who keep us alive and
who keep the starch in our
backbones are these men and
women [poets], young and old.”

Angelou said people must
make sacrifices for their future
generations, much as their
ancestors did.

“Whether our ancestors came
from Ireland  or Germany 
or Eastern Europe  or Asia 
or South America  or Africa
 they have paid for each of us
already,” she said. “All you real-
ly have to do is prepare your-
selves so you can pay for some-
one else who is yet to come.”

Pitt senior Jacob Brody said
Angelou’s viewpoints on life
can help anyone who needs to
feel a sense of self-worth.

“She was very inspiring [how
she told] everyone who has
ever felt alone that they should

_) ..-...'n~‘n~-.

4 . NEWS, Wednesdax, A2111 1;, 1224

look toward their inner strength
and work with the abilities they
have,” Brody said.

“There’s more to life than
what society deems to be true
happiness,” he said. “Inner
strength and peace are true
happiness.”

PPC executive board director
Leslie Tullio said Angelou’s
down—to—earth style of poetry
makes her understandable by
anyone.

“I think a lot of [her work] is
so real,” Tullio said. “It’s not the
lofty kind of writing people
usually associate with poetry.
You find a lot of yourself in all
of her work.”

Student Government Board
President Ross Pasquale said
people dealing with adversity
can find inspiration in
Angelou’s work.

“I think she’s a living, breath-
ing example of how adversity
builds character and empowers
[people] to go out into the
world and make people better,”
Pasquale said.

According to Pitt Assistant
Director of Student Activities
Tom Misuraca, Angelou has a

Another aspect Wofford
believes needs modified,
according to Peters, is the func-
tion of “federalism.” He said the
plan could give states more
controltlhan what Clinton’s plan
allows.

Peters said that with health
care, “the action is going to be

on the state level, not on the
federal level.”

Peters concluded by saying
that Republicans and other
opponents to the final health
reform package would be “mak-
ing an unwise choice” by fili-
bustering the plan and then run-
ning for re-election.

breast cancer studies, in late
March amid reports of further
suspicious research in the 1985
study.

The National Cancer Institute,
which has funded Fisher’s work
for 36 years, had been auditing
Fisher’s ﬁndings.

When he left his position as
chair, Fisher said the audit
would fully conﬁrm the validity
of the findings.

In 1991, it was found that
Dr. Roger Poisson of St.
Luc Hospital in Montreal
submitted falsified reports

in 100 case studies.

However, the NSABP
concluded after “multiple
reana1yses” there was

no change in the study’s find-
ings based on Poisson’s ﬂawed
data.

In recent weeks, Fisher has
stood by the integrity of the
study but has declined requests
for interviews so he could give
the subcommittee a full
account.

According to the New York
Times, the subcommittee staff
interviewed Fisher two days
last week and would not

require his appearance tomor-
row.

Pitt physician Dr. Donald
Trump was appointed to
replace Fisher as -chair of the
NSABP.

Three independent statisti-
cians, appointed by federal offi-
cials, are reanalyzing the study’s
results without the confirmed
ﬂawed data.

According to the NSABP,
more than 5,000 physicians and
484 medical centers and com-
munity hospitals in North
America participated in the
study.

Once again the breakthroughs of medical technology
are bringing another round of ethical dilemmas to be
debated and solved by both the medical and mass
community. Genetic testing is now able to predict who
is likely to develop breast, colon, ovarian and uterus
cancer, Huntington’s disease, Tay—Sachs disease and
cystic fibrosis to name just a few.

Although this new information could help lead to
cures for such diseases, dangers of the testing process
must also be considered.

A pioneer of genetic testing, Dr. Jorges Yunic told
Glamour magazine of how his initial concerns over
testing were brought to reality when a delegation from
the Chinese government arrived at his laboratory and
wanted his testing information on fetuses which
revealed small defects, such as cleft palates and IQs
that were slightly below average. It was essential the
only child couples had was as close to perfect as possi-
ble. Couples wouldn’t want to “waste” their only child
on an “imperfect” one; This exemplifies the dangers of

‘this new technology.

It is true that genetic testing would allow for more
preventative care, though many of the illnesses tested
for have no known cure. This leads one to question
how beneficial the information would be. Some say
they would rather be prepared financially and emotion-
ally for such a disease while others point out that one
may die in a car accident tomorrow and there would
be no benefit to knowing that today. This makes it
essential that testing is left up to the individual, and
that guidelines are in place to protect those who do
choose to be tested.

Without guidelines in place, those obtaining genetic

. testing could ‘feasibly be at risk of losing their health
} coverage, or possibly never be able to obtain it if tested
A at birth and found to be likely to acquire a serious dis-

ease. The implementation of universal health coverage
would help in preventing such discrimination, IF it is
stated clearly in the Clinton plan that testing can not be

. used to deny one coverage. .

More information must be gathered on how people
will respond to genetic-testing information. Just as
many clinics testing for AIDS make it mandatory that
those having the test receive both pre— and post—test
counseling, similar requirements should be made
mandatory for genetic testing. Never should such test-
ing be required or mandatory.

Testing should be optional only for those who have
been thoroughly informed of the procedure and ramifi-
cations involved.

Without guidelines in place, discrimination against
those showing the possibility of acquiring a disease is
almost guaranteed.

When I first heard the news of the death of
Kurt Cobain I became numb — numb to the
point that I am still amazed I didn’t cry at all. I
had the misfortune of getting the final event of
his life from Friday’s “Hard Copy” in a Squirrel
Hill laundromat —— not the time or place to get
word that an idol of yours had killed himself.

He represented something to me that will
always stand as an iconoclastic ideal to revere
—— never let success permeate your motives, no
matter their unpopularity. Tragically, the success
got to him not in the classic sense of self—indul-
gence, but in the mortal sense of death.

The rock star success that he disdained and
fought to fend off eventually led to his demise.
In his final Rolling Stone interview with David
Fricke, Cobain said that he didn’t know how to
deal with his life. “If there were a Rock Star 101
course, I would have liked to take it,” he said.

But Cobain was more than a rock star because
of the effect he had on main-

Cobain was more than a grunge rocker

Cobain and Nirvana kicked in the door to the
mainstream world for all of the ensuing bands
that came later, from the laughable Pilots to the
packaged Nymphs. What became “grunge” start-
ed with Cobain and Nirvana. Pearl Jam frontrnan
Eddie Vedder said this past weekend, “I don’t
think that any of us would be here tonight if it
weren’t for Kurt Cobain.” Cobain not only pio-
neered the commercial movement, but he estab-
lisheda solid ground for the rest of Seattle to
follow.

Then the question that remains to be asked is
“Does ‘inﬂuence’ automatically translate into
‘genius?”’ In this case it does. Cobain was a
genius amongst a legion of wannabes, an unmis-
takable talent who left his mark on music in a
way that Sid Vicious did years before with the
Sex Pistols. They took punk to a level that
Cobain and Nirvana later eclipsed.

In his interview with Cobain, Fricke drew on

stream music and how it changed

comparisons between Cobain and
John Lennon made as far back as

the way punk rock is revered. He Jason 1992, when Michael Azerrad
essentially was Nirvana. Taking linked broken childhoods and
nothing away from bassist Krist Brame marriages to equally controversial

Novoselic or drummer David

Grohl, Cobain wrote virtually all
of the material and held the creative pulse of the
band in the palm of his diminutive hand. He
took the brunt of the bad press, gloried in the
good and made all the rest.

“Maybe when they grow up a little bit, they’ll
realize there’s more things to life than living out
your rock and roll identity so righteously,” was
his reply to the minority of “17-year—olds who
labeled him a sell—out.” He extended his middle
finger in numerous Musician, Advocate and
Melody Maleer interviews to follow, leaving criti-
cal readers and fans stymied. Because of his
constant “f-—— off” to critics, the band as a whole
didn’t deal with legions of bad press. This lack
of criticism and glut of praise exists for a reason.

Maybe Cobain didn’t pioneer the era of
scratchy guitar, but he damn-near perfected it.
His cookie-cutter songs set the tone for the
Seattle scene. Influenced by the Melvins and the
Raincoats, he took the swirl of ﬂying guitars and
crashing drums and amalgamated it into one,
powerful product — “better than a majority of
the commercial sh— that’s been crammed down
people’s throats for a long time,” he once said.

Better yet, he made it commercially viable
without losing any of its sneer. Neuermind,
unlike Bleach before it, possessed enough
power-pop to make it playable on the radio.
“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” which will go down as
the anthem for our generation, galvanized the
19905 and Generation X like none other.

In hindsight it becomes increasingly clear that

and Courtney Love for Cobain.)
Socially, Lennon and Cobain were on different
levels. Between his bed-ins for peace and his
‘60s, All—You-Need-Is-Love simplicity, Lennon
stood more for a change in society than most of
his contemporaries. Cobain’s attentions were
more narrowly focused toward homophobia and
rape — continuing problems in ‘90s America.
Once being quoted as saying he could have just
as easily been gay in a former life, Cobain kissed
Novoselic after a performance on Saturday Night
Live “to spite homophobes.”

Unlike from “Rape Me,” which has several dif-
ferent interpretations, Cobain’s dark entry “Polly”
was solely about rape. He addressed homopho-
bic fans of his in the jacket of Insesticide, telling
them to stay away from his music if they hated
women or gays. It became obvious that Cobain
cared more for the outside world than he let on.
His love for tweaking the noses of critics and
fans alike received more attention than his polit-
ical beliefs. And, unlike such contemporaries as
Axl Rose and Glen Danzig, his destructiveness
was directed toward self, not others.

Because of the twisted times that we live in
where heroes and villains are debated on a daily
basis, Cobain will simultaneously go down in
history as a martyr to his cause of f——k-the-norm
change, and a waste of bottomless talent.

Nevertheless, he was, and will always remain,
one of my biggest heroes.

Mid—week blahs
cost Panthers

another defeat

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

WE ARE FAMILY.

That has been the motto for
the 1994 Pitt baseball team, and
the Panthers have used it to
propel themselves to a 9-0 Big
East record and the early inside
track on the conference cham-

pionship.
It was also the theme for the
1979 world champion

Pittsburgh Pirates. And just in
case the Panthers fear copyright
infringement over use of the
Bucs’ old rallying cry, there is
another, more logical one they
can use.

WAKE ME UP THIS WEEK-
END.

Those five words best sum up
the Panthers’ recent non-confer-
ence, mid-week performance,
which has been a vast departure
from their play in the Big East,
where they have swept
three consecutive weekend
series.

“We just can’t get [the intensi-
tyl up during the week,”
Panther designated hitter Jeff
Montgomery said. “We don’t
know why. We can’t find the
answer.” ’

Chalk up another lackluster
non-Big East performance for
the weekend warriors, who
played themselves out of a
game against Youngstown
State yesterday at Trees Field,

ference game, 10-6, to the
Penguins. o

A six—run sixth inning in
which the Penguins batted
around the lineup spelled doom
for the Panthers, who dropped
to 19-7-1 overall.

The loss was -their‘-second P

straight non-conference defeat,
and gives them a 1-3-1 record
in their last five games
against non-Big East competi-
tion.

The Pitt pitching staff, which
has a 4.19 team ERA in the con-

ference, has given up an aver-
age of nearly seven runs per
game during this stretch, includ-
ing nine to Geneva College
of the NAIA and 14 to
Duquesne in a doubleheader
split. 

Pitt starter Jamie Goettler (1-
2) pitched well early on, but ran
into a roadblock during the
middle innings. He was eventu-
ally saddled with the loss
after giving up five runs, all
earned, in 5 2-3 innings —
his ERA up from

 

rence game

434 to 4.93.

The relief pitching of Matt
Skokowski and Curt Vollmer
did little to stop the damage.
Skokowski came in for Goettler
with two outs and two on base
in the sixth, but quickly
returned to the dugout after giv-
ing up back-to-back home
runs and not recording a single
out.

Vollmer came in and got the
final out of the sixth, but gave
up two runs in the game’s final
3 1-3 innings.

At the plate, two excellent
performances from a couple of
non-starters left Panther head
coach Mark Jackson with a few
decisions to make before filling
out the lineup cards for this
weekend’s three-game set with
Georgetown.

Designated hitter
Montgomery, starting in place
of regular DH Tyler Shantz who
played catcher for this game,
was on fire in his first start of
the 1994 campaign.

Montgomery accounted for
half of the Panthers’ run pro-
duction yesterday, with two
home runs in four at-bats. They
were his second and third hits
of the season.

“Jeff played well out there,”
Jackson said. “We’ll play the
guys who help the team, and
Jeff helped himself out there
today.”

Left fielder Kurt Womelsdorf,

with only eight starts to his
credit before Tuesday, went 3-
for-4 at the plate with two RBI
and a run scored. In 18 appear-

ances this year, Womelsdorf is

Field house goes from ‘new home’ to retirement plans 

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Pitt’s basketball teams will soon be
competing in a new complex. A long-
awaited convocation center is clearly on
the horizon as plans are being finalized
and construction should begin soon. The
following quote is taken from the Pitt
yearbook:

“A new field house rises out of our
imagination  A new home for Pitt
champions  a hardwood basketball
pavilion with seating in the thousands,
equipment for every college sport
strong minds in strongibodies . . the
awakening of the potential strength of
our nation ;.. the development of good
sportsmanship and fair play.”

It seems fitting in analyzing the current
situation of Pitt’s basketball needs. This
description surprisingly appeared, how-
ever, in Pitt’s 1951 yearbook, and was
referring to Fitzgerald Field House,
named after the chancellor responsible
for its inception, Rufus Fitzgerald, and
completed late in that year.

The field house served to answer the
prayers of Pitt’s administration, students
and fans in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s in
the same fashion as the new convocation
center promises to do upon its comple-
tion later this decade.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran an
article on Feb. 1, 1949, that described
plans for a new field house at Pitt as part

knocking

of an overall program initiated by
Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald. The expan-
sion plan was to consist of eight new
buildings.

In addition to the field house, plans
were discussed to construct a new stu-

dent union, science building, library, '

gym, medical school, nursing school and
clinical labs.

The total eight-building expansion
plan was estimated to cost nearly $20
million.

The expansion was hard-pressed
because the university was facing a
major lack-of—facilities problem in the
late ‘40s as people returning from World
War II were pouring into colleges
nationwide to begin or continue their
education.

The university was coaxed into selling
the property where its former basketball
site named Trees Gym and a track build-
ing called the Old Track House once
stood to the federal government.

The government built the Veteran’s
Hospital on the site, leaving the city with
a medical structure to help serve veter-
ans, but at the same time leaving Pitt
with inadequate athletic facilities. Due to
the destruction of the old athletic facili-
ties, Pitt faced a major problem of
acquiring a gym and athletic facility or
facing losing qualiﬁcation to teach physi-
cal education.

The Panthers also played basketball in
an indoor arena called the Pavilion,

Fitzgerald Field House will be replaced as the primary home of Pitt hoops

field house that brought great anticipation.

(nicknamed “the hole,” among other
things) at that time, which was crammed
under the seats of Pitt Stadium near Gate
One.

But capacity was only about 2,000
people.

Fitzgerald, who was provost at Pitt
from 1938 to 1945 and served as chan-
cellor from 1945 to 1955, in addressing
the need for expansion, placed a new
field house at the top of the list. And in

Zittle gut)/5’ shine in Pcmt/oer [055

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Sta.[7'W1-iter

Everyone knows the big
names. They get all the publici-
ty: magazine covers, radio inter-
views, “Sportscenter” highlights,
etc.

But what about the little men?
Well, say, “Hello!” to junior
infielder Jeff Montgomery and
junior outfielder Kurt
Womelsdorf.

Yesterday at Trees’ Field,
Montgomery broke from obscu-
rity and led a comeback for the
Panthers that fell short against
the Penguins of Youngstown
State University.

Montgomery, playing in his
seventh game of the season,
went a modest 2-for-4 with two
not-so—modest home runs and
three RBI. For a player who was
1-for-6 on the year (.167),
Montgomery’s day was phe-
noinenal.

“Jeff [Montgomery] played
well today,” Pitt head coach
Mark Jackson said.

Montgomery started slowly,

striking out swinging in his first
plate appearance.

“In my first at-bat, I was press-
ing a little bit because I wanted
to prove something,”
Montgomery said. “Some of the
guys just told me to relax and
just have fun so I did.”

His next time up, in the bot-
tom of the fifth inning,
Montgomery got a hold of a “fat
one” and drove it over the fence
in left center field.

“I took a good cut on the first
pitch and missed it, but it felt
real good,” Montgomery stated.
“The next pitch was right there
and I just hit it out.”

Montgomery was the only
Panther to figure out
Youngstown St. starter Gary
Gubanich, who stymied the Pitt
attack over seven strong
innings.

“Their pitcher wasn’t throw-
ing hard at all," Montgomery
said. "He had a good change-
up, but that’s what I hit for my
second homer.”.

came in the bottom of the sev-
enth inning, and it was a
towering shot over the left
field fence that drove in two
runs.

This second blast of the game
brought the Panthers to within
five runs, but they never did
catch the Penguins.

“Right now, we just can’t get it
up during the week,”
Montgomery said about the Pitt
team. “We can’t find the answer.
We don’t know why.”

Montgomery said that he is
ready for an everyday starting

Against Youngstown State,
Womelsdorf helped himself
with three hits in four at-bats
with two RBI, one run scored
and one stolen base.

On the year Womelsdorf is
now batting .409. He has 13
runs scored, 10 RBI and is sport-

Womelsdorf was also part of

one of Pitt's problems
against the Penguins —
baserunning.

stolen a total of 140 bases this
season but against YSU the
Panthers only managed to

when he was picked off at third

batting .409 with 13
runs scored in just 22 at-bats.

In the early innings, it
looked as if the fans in atten-
dance at Trees Field would
be in for a pitching duel

between Goettler and
Penguin starter Gary
Gubanich.

Goettler was cruisin’ along
through the first four innings,
pitching his way out of jams
in the second and third
frames to give Pitt’s more-
than-capable offensive unit
some time to score a few
runs.

However, the Penguin bat-
tery of Gubanich and catcher
Brad Ziegler was doing more
than its fair share of
work in keeping the
potent Panther attack under
control.

In each of the first three
innings, a Panther baserun-
ner was either picked off by
Gubarich or gunned down

by Ziegler while attempting
to steal.

Those early judgmental
errors kept the Panthers off
the scoreboard for the early
part of the game.

The YSU batters finally got
to Goettler in the fifth inning.
After getting Penguin DH
Jason Triveri to pop out and
first baseman Mark
Birkmeier to strike out,
Goettler walked catcher Joe
Ayette, then gave up a
two—run dinger to right field-
er Nick Meiring.

Meiring’s blast gave YSU a
2-0 advantage.

The Panthers answered
with a run of their own in the
bottom half of the fifth
when Montgomery hit
his first round-tripper of the
day over the wall in left-cen-
ter, cutting the Penguin lead
to 2-1.

Pitt lost a chance to tie the
game later in the inning,

however, when Womelsdorf
was caught leaning a little too
far off third base and was
picked off by Ziegler to end the
inning.

The sixth inning was where
the Penguins took full control of
the game.

Their six—spot in the sixth all
began after Goettler had gotten
the first two batters out on a
ground ball to short and a fly
ball to center.

His first mistake was the two-
out walk he gave to third base-
man John Silvey.

Three singles, three home
runs, two stolen bases, one wild
pitch and two passed balls later,
the Panthers found themselves
on the short end of an 8-1 ball-
game.

The Panthers inched their
way back with a three—run sev-
enth inning to cut the Penguin
lead to 8-4, but two more YSU
runs in the final two innings
nullified a two—run eighth by
the Panthers and gave
Youngstown State its sixth win
of the season.

tour of the country’s premier
athletic facilities.

Hamilton’s fact—finding tour
included stops of the Big Ten
facilities graded as top-notch at
that time, and included Illinois,

Ohio State, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Iowa and
Minnesota. -

At first thought, plans were
drawn up for a combination
field house/gym complex to be
located near the entrance to
Schenley Park where the Frick
Fine Arts building now stands.
The plans progressed as far as
obtaining permits from the city,
but were later scrapped due to
exorbitant cost over—runs
expected.

The university ﬁnally decided
to build the athletic facility on

_top of the hill above Pitt

Stadium, where it now stands.
The cost of the shell was
$360,000 with the final comple-

tion from start to finish totaling
almost $15 million. The field
house stands 50 feet high with
dimensions of 370 feet long by
160 feet wide.

Chancellor Fitzgerald was
quoted after its completion that
the field house proved to be
one of the premier basketball
and athletic complexes in the
country.

He also thought that universi-
ty expansion was contributing
to the city’s efforts of a rebuild-
ing and improvement plan of
Pittsburgh.

On Dec. 12, 1951, Pitt’s bas-
ketball coach, Doc Carlson, led
local media on a tour as
the new field house was uncov-
ered.

As Carlson led the reporters
onto the court, he proudly
exclaimed, “Well boys, here it
is!”

The dedication ceremony
took place on Saturday, Dec. 15,
1951 at 8:00 p.m. and was offi-
cially christened Pitt Memorial
Field House.

Field House was renamed
Fitzgerald Field House follow-
ing the assassination of John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, the field
house was indeed later named
in honor of Chancellor
Fitzgerald.

In his dedication speech,
Chancellor Fitzgerald said, “The
plans of the university will
make this more of a campus
university with an increasing
number of students participat-
ing in extracurricular activities.
With this development will
come a. spirit which will com-
mand a loyalty of students,
alumni and friends.

"This great field house, which
we are dedicating tonight, is
an important step in that direc-
tion. ,

This field house is dedicated
to the health and strength of
young men. It is dedicated to
the development of character
through clean competition and
clean living.”

A basketball game followed
the dedication in which the
Panthers beat the previous
year’s Eastern Champs —
Columbia University.

There have been many
improvements to the field house
in the 40—plus years since its
inception. The track-that encir-
cles the basketball court was
originally dirt, as were the pole
vault pits. The track
was replaced with a hard sur-
face.

Upgrades were also imple-
mented in the seating area as
the caliber of Pitt’s basketball
program improved throughout
the years.

There have also been count-
less memories from sporting
events.which have taken place
at the field house over the last
40-plus years.

“My most memorable experi-
ence in the field house was
when Jerome Lane broke the
backboard slamming a dunk
against Providence.” Paul
Hipp (known as Panther Paul)
said.

As plans for the new convoca-
tion center are unveiled and
completed, the Panther basket-
ball and other teams may be
moving from Fitzgerald Field
House, but memories of events
held in the field house will
never be forgotten.
