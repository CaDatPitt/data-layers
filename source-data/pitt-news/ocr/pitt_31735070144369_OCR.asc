Pitt’s greek community over-

County to host forum for
anti-discrimination bill  

by Becky Reiser
Staﬁ’ Writer

As Allegheny County gears up

to vote on a new civil rights law, an

interest group from outside the area
is rallying to ﬁght it.

The Allegheny County Council

A will hold a public hearing Jan. 15 at

, 5 p.m. at the Allegheny Courthouse

on Grant Street Downtown to de-

. hate the bill, which protects individ-
uals against discrimination within
the county ' i

If passed, the bill would protect.

against prejudice in business, em-
ployment or housing on the basis
of “color, religion, national origin,

ancestry or place of birth, sex, gen-
der identity or expression, sexual
orientation, disability, marital status,
age or use of a guide or support an-
imal because of blindness, deafness
or physical disability,” according to
the County Council description of
the bill. The bill would also provide
a means to resolve conflicts of this
nature.

\While the city of Pittsburgh al-
ready has a similar law in place, indi-
viduals are not necessarily protected
outside of city limits. '

The American Family Asso-
ciation of Pennsylvania, an interest

group based outside of Allegheny -

County that calls itself a “statewide

traditional values group,” opposes
the bill. The group has vowed to
speak out on the ordinance, which
would enable people to buy houses,
use bathrooms or become em-
ployed while being protected from
discrimination by-law
‘ The organization, which is
based in Franklin, Pa, nicknamed
the bill an “Ordinance to Allow
Men in Women’s Shower Facilities,”
according to a news release, and it
disagrees that the ordinance should
include the phrase “sexual orienta-
tion or gender identiﬁcation.”

The president of the associa-
tion, Diane Gramley, said in a news
release that the American Fam-

efforts between the Interfraternity

Conference fraternities, National

Panhellenic Conference sororities
and the historically black National
Panhellenic Council" organizations.

After a general introduction in
the Union ballroom, the confer-
ences ’ divided into ‘three rooms,
each using a distinct recruiting ap-
proach.

The NPHC fraternity and soror-
ity members dressed to impress for
a formally structured panel session.

After brief background intro-
ductions from each organization,
recruits sitting in the audience were
offered note cards to present ques-
tions to the panel anonymously.

On the more casual end, most
IFC organization members wore
jeans and sweatshirts.

Students enjoyed pizza as they
browsed and chatted with repre-
sentatives from each of Pitt’s 17
IFC chapters.

Taylor Smith, the IFC Vice presi-
dent of recruitment, explained why
the spring recruitment is different
from the one in the fall.

“Spring recruitment is generally
smaller and less formal, because
students tend to already have ideas
of which frats theyfre interested
in,” said Smith.

The Panhel sorority members
dressed professionally for the
event, relying on the structure of
the meet—and—greet to set the tone
for the recruitment process.

“In the spring, there is a lot

and December 5.

more responsibility and self—reli—j

ance for the recruits because by the
spring even freshmen tend to have
the system figured out,” said Chel-
sea Zimmerman, the vice president
of programming for Panhel.

Students who attended the event
last night received a list of upcom-
ing events held by each greek orga-
nization. '

Some of the events are less for-
mal in the spring. Rho Gammas,
Panhel's recruitment leaders who
give recruits unbiased information
about each sorority, do not attend
the events for regulation purposes.

The fall recruitment process,
which usually takes place the third
week of school, involves dividing
recruits into groups that are re-
quired to visit each house of a re-
spective conference to ensure that

each organization receives equal‘

attention, said Panhel chief justice
Lucy Matz.
Because of membership caps,

not every sorority can take in re- '

cruits in the spring, making bid day
and visits less formal, as well.
During the spring, recruits are
not required to visit each house or
chapter. At the end of recruitment,
accepted recruits receive a phone
call from interested organizations,

I instead of an official card offering

them the option to bid, said Matz.

"It's still very competitive," she
said. — —
This spring’s bid day is Friday,
Jan. 23.

ily Association said the Boy Scouts, Salvation
Army and Catholic Charities were discrimi-
nated against because of their beliefs.

Nikolai Condee-Padunov, the political ac-
tion chair of Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, said he
believes that the group is  to restrict citi-
zens’ iights, even if it does not directly affect
them.

“Look at the Mormons in Utah who spoke
out about Proposition 8 in California. It’s an
external force  to localize an issue,” said
Condee—Padunov. _

OUITS.

Root said Pitt has held events in remem-

brance of Foster since the 19303, when the
school built the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Not only was Foster one of the na-
tion’s first professional songwriters, said
Root, but he was “the ﬁrst person, through
music, to get people to understand the
needs of everyday life.”

Root said Foster’s music speaks of the
challenges of everyday life, and that “itgot
people to realize the need for individual,
human dignity,” when the nation was stuck
in the midst of the Civil War and debating
the morality of slavery.

Root gave a presentation on Foster at
an event held yesterday afternoon at the
Pittsburgh High School for the Creative
and Performing Arts, Downtown. Students
in the school’s chorus, orchestra and band
performed.

CCAC’s free tuition good

Last week, the Community
College of Allegheny County an-
nounced a plan to help residents
weather the worst of the reces-
sion by extending tuition and fee
waivers to any person who has

_been laid off from work within
the last two years.

To be eligible, an applicant
only has to apply for ﬁnancial
aid and to provide some form
of proof that his lack of work is

the result of a layoff. Participants V

can enroll in one of five high-
demand certiﬁcate or degree

programs: information technol- «

ogy, basic electronics,‘ phleboto-
my, EMT training or nurse’s aid
training. CCAC will pay for up
to 36 credits in any of these pro-
grams that aren’t covered by the
student’s ﬁnancial aid.

Programs like this could be
part" of the reason why Pitts-
burgh has a reputation as a “re—
cession-proof” community. Not
only has the city been more will-
ing to invest heavily in emerging
industries andtechnologies such
as health care’, education and
computer technology, but it has
invested in programs to re-edu-

’ Cate workers, in these ﬁelds. '

According to the CCAC Web
site, 92 percent of graduates
' from the school’s~programs work
for local employers, meaning

' that a trained CCAC student will

almost deﬁnitely end up work-

° ing in the county. This serves

_to keep unemployment low and

puts more money back into the '

economy.

CCAC’s strategy ‘for dealing
with the recession is also sig-
niﬁcantly different from Pitt’s.
Last month, Chancellor’Norden-
berg wrote an open letter to the
school detailing his plan for the

  for students and community

hard economic struggles ahead.
The letter details the progress
Pitt has made in the last few
years, the fact that the state will
be providing nearly $11.3 million
less to Pitt than in previous years
and that the school’s endowment
has lost nearly 22 percent of its
value. It’s clear that this is, at least
in part, an attempt to justify the

6 percent tuition increase for in-_
state students and 4 percent for

out—of—state students.

Of course,the goals of the

two institutions are completely
different, as are the costs — one

credit-hour costs $534 at in-state '

rates at Pitt, versus $85.25 for
an in-county resident at CCAC.
However, their widely differing
strategies also speak to the idea
that Pitt is primarily concerned
with increasing its standing and
reputation, while CCAC is mak-
ing an effort to help laid-off
workers improve their situations.

That said, there are still a few
issues with the proposal. CCAC
continues to operate at its nor-
mal costs, even if the school
might be losing money on tu-
ition.

There should be a reliable
plan in place for ensuring\ the
cost of lost tuition doesn’t be-
come too heavy or cut into the
regular operating budget of the
program. It would be a shame to
lose something this helpful over
nothing .more than monetary

. COIICCIIIIS.

Overall, CCAC’s program
should be commended. Not only
is it an active and progressive way
of helping the residents of the
county stay active in the work-
force, but it makes the economy
of the entire region stronger as a
result.

Tuesdays With Molly

Inaugurating on a shoestring

by Molly Green
Colum/zidt

It appears as though the presi-
dential - inauguration ceremony
believes itself to be above this eco-
nomic recession. I don’t know’ who
it thinks it is, or why it thinks it’s irn—
portant enough that the American
taxpayers should spend $40 million
dollars, the total estimated cost ac-
cording to an Associated Press re-
port, on what is clearly a second-rate
Macy’s  Day Parade. .

The thought of dropping this

much money on an unimportant .

event like a presidential inauguration
is absolutely devastating, especially
when the government could alter-
natively use that money to buy out

-something important. For instance,

the now-bankrupt Steve & Barryfs, a
clothing chain cherished by Amanda
Bynes fans everywhere.

While the era of Steve & Barry’s
and its $10 jeans has tragically passed
—— we’ll never forget you! — it’s not
too late to save some other ﬂoun-
dering, probably—crappy—to-begin-
with business. As such, I’ve devised
a few ways to cut down on this so-
called inauguration “celebration.”

According to the report, the in-
auguration ceremony has employed
quite the staff, including 432 staff
members of the elusive Presidential
Inaugural Committee. -The origins
of this shadowy group are difﬁcult
to track down, though I suspect it’s
largely comprised of rejected con-
testants from “The Bachelor” who
are desperately  to relive the

 

  opinions

extravagance of their champagne
and roses days. Only a former con-
testant of the “The Bachelor” would
realistically request not one, not two,
not even ﬁve, but 10  balls.

vWhat’s more, this committee is
completely unnecessary — no ac-
tual planning for this event is even
needed, as ‘President-elect Barack
Obarna could simply borrow all the
necessary ideas and designs from the
movie ‘The Wedding Planner.” If it

is good enough for L0, it is good‘

enough for our future president.

The inauguration ceremony also
calls for 8,000 District of Columbia
police ofﬁcers, 550 Metro transit
police, 10,000 National Guardsmen
and 58 law-enforcement and other
agencies working on security. I had
a good laugh when I read that, be-
cause, if it’s  smartly, theo-
retically the government doesn’t
have to employ anyone. If we en-
slave- the population of Ohio, we
could not only save a tremendous
‘amount of money but also. pave the
way for Pennsylvania to claim Cedar
Point as its own.

Sure, there are trust issues -—- af-
ter all, these people are from Ohio

— but, according to the US. Census

Bureau, the state does have a popu-
lation of about 11.5 million people
(something it’s very vocal and brag-
gy about during election times), and
this could cover not only the secu-
rity staff, but the cooks, hotel staff,
janitors, etc

There are other  that could
use a cutback or two, as well. For

example, the Metro is printing two -

million inauguration subway maps
—— ew. What a waste of money and
paper. Clearly, this ceremony has

budg/et
no respect for this coun s cur-
rent economic or environmental
situation, with one grimy hand in
the bank and the other one happily
cutting down trees and  dol-
phins

In general, the plans for this in-
auguration are just riddled with un-
necessary luxuries: 112 streetlight
bulbs, 4,100 portable toilets, 10,000
square feet of inauguration stage,
12,000 eggs. I’ve never heardcrazy
talk like this before. Food, electric-
ity and toilets, while nice, are hardly
necessary to have a pleasant inaugu-
ral experience. And while I see the
importance of a nice big stage, why
not instead employ Ohioan slave la-
bor to build it free of charge?

Finally, there is the issue of tick-
ets. In- what is no doubt some ploy
for public image —— perhaps by
some rejected bachelorette 
for her own show — it has been de-
cided that there will be 240,000 free
tickets handed out to various mem-
bers of the American public

And here I was  this was
a country based on capitalism. We
are in a recession, people. Instead of

throwing another $40 million in the 0°

hole, the government could turn a
proﬁt-on this event;

In fact, ‘not only should it charge
admission to the actual event (and
this includes Obarna’s ticket, as well
— no handoutsl), the government
should  those watching it on-
line or on television as well. Trust
me, we’ll all be smoking $100 bills
again in not time.

of Sderot, have become moot
as people claim that Israel has

Gaza. The current war is defen-
sive on the part of Israel, as the
rockets launched from Gaza have
been reaching farther into Israel
proper than ever before.

As the presidentof the Zionist

dents to stand strong and educate
themselves on the truth about
what is currently going on in Isra-

available to educate people about
the history of this conﬂict, and
I believe that it is imperative to

Theater bare A

by Kieran Layton
Staﬁ’ Writer

Metamorphoses

Jan. 15 — Feb. 15

Produced by the

Pittsburgh Public Theater
O'Rei|ly Theater, Downtown
412-316-1600

$15.50 through Pitt Arts

If you’re searching for a way
to get your ﬁll of classical Greek
mythology without having to read

The cast of Public Theater's "Nletamorphorses" seems to have forgotten their costumes --

a textbook or sit through a classics
lecture, Pittsburgh Public The-
ater’s newest production might be
the answer to your problems.

In Mary Zirnmerman’s “Meta—
morphoses,” mythical characters
enact well-known stories for the
audience around the production’s
centerpiece, an on—stage pool of.
water.

Adapted from Ovid’s famous
poem of the same name, the play
revolves around appropriate myths

O
that focus on the idea, as implied
by the title, of change. Ultimately,
through depictions of themes like
love, heartbreak, greed and the
fragile human condition, the play
reminds the audience of classical
mythology’s timeless quality.
Some of the more well—known
myths performed include Midas
and his cursed golden touch, the
tragic story of Orpheus’ descent
into Hades to find his beloved
Eurydice and Phaeton’s ill—fated

  'emorphoes'

steering of Apollo’s chariot.

The on—stage pool of water
presents an interesting element to
the play for the actors, the tech-
nical crew and the audience, said
Monica Bowin, the director of
production and operations.

Throughout the show, charac-
ters use the pool to represent spe-
cific features of each myth. For
example, a scene with Narcissus

. sees the pool as his mirror, while

another has the pool act as the

 

 
 

thank God for the sheet-like stage curtain!

River Styx of the underworld.

“I’ve never done a show like
this before,” said Bowin. “\Y/ater
does provide a lot of challenges.
It’s a live element, it’s dynamic ——
it certainly isn’t static. It can evapo-
rate and cause humidity problems,
[and] it has to be kept clean with
chemicals — and there’s the issue
of leaks, spills and tracking water
on the set.”

She added, though, that the
cast has been remarkably ﬂexible

American Idol: New judge, same lack of talent

by Tony J ovenitti
Staﬂ IV/‘its/‘

The epic reality show "Ameri-
can Idol" is back for its eighth sea-
son, and this year there are some
changes. There is a new judge on the
panel. Kara DioGuardi will join Si-

mon,‘ Randy and Paula in critiquing
the singers’ talent—— or lack thereof.
The auditions begin tonight at

8 on FOX, and this is the chance
for America to get a glimpse of
what’s to come in the new season.
It’s the first look at the great tal-
ent of American amateurs who have

struggled all their lives to achieve
their dream of becoming  OK,
who am I kidding? Nobody watches
the auditions for the good singers.
They watch for the W/illiam Hungs.

If there’s onethingthatTV—watch—

ing Americans love, it’s train wrecks.

This year viewers get to see

the worst singers from eight dif-
ferent cities —— East Rutherford,
N.]., Jacksonville, Fla, Kansas
City, Louisville, Phoenix, Salt Lake
City, San Francisco and San Juan,
Puerto Rico. Sure, some of the
good singers appear in the audi—
tion phase — but that is just so

viewers’ ears don’t start bleed-
ing from an excess of screeching.

The producers are treating au-
diences to nine full hours of audi-
tions + the ﬁrst seven episodes
— which ensure at least 90 train
wrecks. Happy New Year, America.

Not only will there be hilari-

Like B_ettis, ‘Ledger a 5“

by Tom VanBuren
Senior Staﬂ Writer

 

A Like most good Pittsburghers, I spent
Sunday night glued to the TV in anticipation,
ﬁngers crossed and heart a-ﬂutter — because
the Golden Globes were on, of course.

The first two months of the year are a spe-
cial time indeed for both football fans and ﬁlm
nerds —— months of speculation and anticipa-
tion pay off in a few choice evenings of our
favorite celebrities dressing up and hoping to
win an award or two. \V1th the Golden Globes
come and gone, movie ‘buffs can look forward
to next Thursday’s Oscar nominees’ armounce—
ment And if the Globes were any indication
(and they often are), every fanatic who pores
over the weekend box office returns instead
of playing Monday morning quarterback can
breathe a  of nerd relief —— Heath Ledger
posthumously won a supporting actor award
for his role in “The Dark Knight”

I think he deserved to win, but like any
good little sycophant, I have long worshipped
at the altar of “The DarkiKnight” So while I
agree that Hollywood awarded an unparalleled
performance, I must also acknowledge that

_ it accomplished that most basic task that has

always been at the heart of its existence: It told
a story. i

Just like audiences ﬁnd a thrill watching Bat-
man save Gotham City, they love a story of tri-
umph that takes place in the real world -—— one
without theattics like vigilantes in capes and
cowls. People like a story of a person worldng
hard,  great sacriﬁces and  the
respect of his peers. It sounds cont:-_ived,'but
it’s a familiar and convenient story model that is
unlversaly appealing

Over the course of the next season, the

to the Super Bowl, and on a cold February
night, they beat the Seattle Seahawks in Bettis’s

McCoy's
decision  

delayed

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

Running back LeSean McCoy spoke to
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt today to tell
him that he’s not yet ready to make a ﬁnal
decision on whether to stay in school or
enter the 2009 NFL Draft.

McCoy, Pitt’s leading rusher and a first-
team All—Big East selection the last two
years, said in December that he planned
to return for his junior year. However, re-
ports came out last Thursday night that
he ‘was leaning toward declaring early.

McCoy met with Wannstedt and de-
cided to take the weekend to speak with
his family and decide. When he spoke to
Wannstedt this afternoon, he informed
the coach that he needed more time.

Wannstedt told McCoy to take as
much time as he needs for the decision.
But the deadline for underclassmen to ﬁle
paperwork to enter the draft is Thursday,

so the decision must be made in the next '

two days.

If he decides to enter, McCoy is ex-
pected to be a late ﬁrst—round or early
second—round selection.

 

 

Weight Watching for vvrestlers

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬂ Writer

Before Tyler Nauman steps onto the
mat for a wrestling match, he needs to step
on a scale to check his weight.

Like the rest of Pitt’s wrestling team,
Nauman must maintain a certain weight if
he wants to bothwrestle in his weight class
and perform at his highest ability.

“Maintaining a weight is very important
in the sport of wrestling,” said Nauman,
a redshirt freshman. “You always want to

be as strong as you can be when you’re out .

on the mat. So, by maintaining your weight
as close to the weight class you wrestle
in, you’re able to keep as much of your
strength as possible.”

Every weight class is different in
wrestling, but if a wrestler overeats or
loses too much weight, his weight class
will change. And for some wrestlers, the
change will not allow them to perform
successfully. '

Or at all. .

Diana Connor /‘enior Staff Photographer

Pitt wrestler Zach Sheaffer attempts to bring down an opponent earlier this season.

 

“An hour before a match, the wrestler
weighs in,” said Pitt coach Rande‘
Stottlemyer. “If ‘ [the wrestler] is over, he
will not be allowed to compete.”

Junior Ryan Tomei said pressure comes
with the sport, but experience will ease the
stress.

Still, both Tomei and Nauman agree
that a healthy diet is necessary to stay in
their weight class. Watching what and how
much of something they eat only adds to
the pressures of a wrestler.

“Most wrestlers watch their diets,” said
Nauman. “Our lifting coaches provide
us with diets to suit our body and weight
classes. All the goodies most students eat,
like chips, cookies, beer and pizza, wrestlers
can only enjoy at certain times.”

Tomei, a heavyweight, might have
an easier time when it comes to weight
management, but that doesn’t stop him
from staying healthy.

“Considering my weight class, I do
not need to watch what I eat,” explained

Tomei. “But I do make sure Ileat the rightc

food most of the time and exercise a lot.”

All of the healthy eating, however,
needs to be turned into muscleand energy.
Tomei and Nauman explained that on top
of team practices, most wrestlers work
out every day. And it can take a toll on the
team. .
“It takes so much hard work and time
that some days, other than practicing, all
you’re able to do is sleep,” said Nauman.

Still, coaches don’t want to see their
players fall behind. The players can do so
much to maintain their weight, but coaches
are also there to support them.

Men's Basketball _

Pitt retains top rank

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

For the second straight week, Pitt is on
top of the world of college basketball. And
from the looks of things, that’s where it
wants to stay. '

After earning the nation’s No. 1'-ranking
for the first time in school history last week,
Pitt claimed the No. 1-spot in both the As-
sociated Press and ESPN / USA Today polls
once again yesterday. The Panthers didn’t

play last week but maintained the nation’s

top spot in the polls after a convincing 90-

67 win over St. _]ohn’s in the Petersen Events

Center on Sunday afternoon.

“I was proud of how we responded [to
the ranking] during the first week,” said Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon yesterday afternoon. “I
thought we practiced well, and I thought we
handled it we .”

Wake . Forest, Duke, -Connecticut and
North‘ Carolina round out the top five in
the AP poll, while Duke, Wake Forest, Con-
necticut and Oklahoma fall behind Pitt in
the ESPN / USA Today poll.

Pitt (15-0, 3-0 Big East) earned 70 of the
possible 72 f1rst—place votes in the AP, with
Wake Forest (14-0) grabbing the other two
after taking down North Carolina on Sun-
day night. -

Pitt also earned all but two of the votes
in the ESPN/ USA Today poll, with Wake
Forest taking. the other two, as well.

Dixon said that getting the team’s first-

ever win as the nation’s top team was nice, p

but it doesn’t change Pitt’s goals for the sea-
son. A
“There was - very little talk about it

ing for second straight week ”

amongst our team,” said Dixon. “There was
no real difference of how we acted or in our
behavior in any way.”

While Pitt stayed as one of three unde-"
feated teams left in the NCAA and held its
position in the polls, the Big East — which
had nine teams ranked in the Top 25 last
week — did see West Virginia drop out of
the rankings after a 22-point loss to Mar-
quette, giving the conference eight spots.

Pitt plays South Florida at home on
Wednesday night before traveling to Louis-
ville on Saturday. ’

Sims out for season, Popovec to miss 2-4 Weeks

by Zack Chakan

Coming off two disheartening defeats
in the last week, the Pitt women’s basketball
team must deal with two losses of another
kind.

The Panthers announced that junior point
guard Jania Sims will miss the remainder of
the regular season with bilateral tibial stress

The 5—feet—7—inch junior averaged 9.6
points per game last season and 6.9 points in
her 48 career games.

Sims will apply for a medical redshirt be-
cause she only played in one game.

Former point guard Mallorie Winn, who
started on Pitt’s Sweet 16 squad last year, was
awarded a medical redshirt after missing all
of the 2006-07 season froman injured knee.
