Activities Office Action Pitt Policies Watched inD.C.
Postpones SG Election

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Student Government
election has been postponed for
one week by the Office of Student
Activities due to alleged improprie-
ties in a Student Government
Judicial Board (SGJB) hearing that
upheld a previous ruling not to
permit board candidates Michael
Bates and Sally Shoup to appear on

the ballot.

The election
originally was
scheduled for
Wednesday
and Thursday
of this week.

 

aecnom 

ordered the Student Activities staff

to create a mechanism for Bates to ’

appeal the SGJB decision, because
there is no existing mechanism to
process an appeal of a SGJB
decision.

According to sources close to the
incident, Bates’ request for a new
hearing rests on his claim that SGB
President Barry Weisband said
something to -the members of the
Judicial Board prior to Wednesday
nights’ hearing that may have

prejudiced their decision-against he '

and Shoup.

Weisband denies involvement in
any improper activity prior to th
hearing. ‘

Both Bates and Shoup appealed?

to the SGJB following the Student
Government Election Committee
(SGEC) ruling that denied them
certiﬁcation because their tran-
scrips were not turned in by the
petition deadline of 4 p.m. Friday,
January 7. ‘

Bates is challenging the Judicial
Board decision on the basis that an
impropriety in the proceedings may

~ have prejudiced the Board against
his case.

Shoup has decided not to appeal
on the basiseof improprieties in the
Judicial Board hearing, according
to the Young Socialist Alliance
campaign manager Tom Twiss,

‘ although she has officially" declared
herself a write-in candidate.

According to Associate Director
of Student Activities Terry Milani,

the Activities staff determined the

election should be postponed to
allow Bates the opportunity to
appeal the decision.

“There was enough “of a
potential case to warrant another

' hearing," Milani said.

Milani said the Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs Alfred Moye

The College Young Demo-
crats (CYD) and the lnterfrater-
nity and Panhellenic Council
announced their endorsements
for Student Government Board
yesterday.

The CY D endorsement in- .
cludes Bernie Payne for SGB
president" and Dave Hesidence,
Chip Hubbard, JoAnne Levison
and Cleo Sumpter for board.
IFC and Panhell announced a
combined endorsement of Ber-
nie Payne for president, Ahmie
Baum, Dave Hesidence, Tyrone
“Chip" Hubbard, JoAnn Levi-

son and Gary Tweed.

‘ Milani said the appeal, if ﬁled by
noon today, will be heard Wednes-
day night by members of the
campus judicial board moderated
by Al Bowen, the Campus Judicial
coordinator.

Milani said the charges would not
be ﬁled through the judicial system,
and the members of the campus
judicial board would simply act as,
an impartial hearing board.

“This does not set a precedent,”
Milani said. ‘ ‘We are not providing

Pitt’s hiring and firing practices
are under Congressional scrutiny
that could lead to a formal House
investigation, according ‘to a
Washington source involved in the
inquiry. .

This preliminary investigation
was sparked by the case of M.
Oskoui, an associate professor of
pharmacology at Pitt who faced
dismissal more than a year ago due
to charges of alleged incompetence.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar inter-
vened, postponing a decision until
June of this year.

Oskoui, who is tenured, charges
“harrassment, interference and
discrimination,” according to Edi-
son Montgomery, associate vice
chancellor for the health profes-
sions. .

Vicki Assevero, legislative coun-

. sel to the House subcommittee on

equal opportunity, sent Pitt a
letter dated Dec. 20 requesting
inform.ation on the Oskoui case. A
reply’ from Vice Chancellor for
Health Professions Nathan Stark
was “unsatisfactory,” according to
Assevero, who added that inquiry
will continue with the threat of
formal investigation.

‘ ‘We got a reply which denied any
wrongdoing but which was unsat-
isfactory and there will be further
inquiry,” Assevero said. “I am not
entirely convinced they (Pitt) have
been entirely straightforward in
their replies.

“We_ were informed that there
were discrepancies in hiring at the
University of Pittsburgh, especially
in the Slavic department,” Assev-
ero said. She also said Oskoui was
the only person whose case was
mentioned in the Dec. 20 letter to
Pitt’s administration.

Stark, who is chief administrator
for six health professions schools
including the School of Pharmacy,

Coffee Prices Boiling Over

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

Pitt students will probably
have to pay more for a cup of coffee
in the near future whether they
make it themselves or buy it on
campus.

Coffee increased 80 cents for the
standard three-pound can in the
past few weeks and now sells for
$7.80 a can. This represents a one
hundred percent increase in the
past eighteen months.

Still, people seem to be buying
as much, or possibly more, than
they ever did.

“Too many people are afraid to
go without coffee,” said one local
supermarket manager. “As the
price of coffee started to increase,
there was a substantial drop in our
coffee sales but they picked back

up again. Coffee is too much of our
lifestyle to do without.”

On campus, where the cost of
coffee hasn’t increased, sales are
booming.

“We’re having the best coffee
sales we’ve had in a long time,”
said Leslie Frank of the Bev-0-
Matic Company, which services the
coffee machines on /campus. “The
cold weather really helped to
promote sales, plus the fact that
people are realizing that 20 cents is
a real bargain for a cup of coffee
these days.”

The chances that the price of
coffee will decrease or even remain
stable in the near future are slim,
however.

“As far as I can tell,” said "a
spokesman for the Giant Eagle
Company. “The price of coffee will

continue to rise until people stop

buying so much of it, or until the
supply increases. I think a boycott
of coffee would work if people
would actually carry it out, but I
don’t think they will. When it
comes to coffee, people are nuts.”

“If the price of coffee goes up,”
said Frank, “then we’ll probably
have to raise the cost of our coffee
from 20 cents to 25 cents. We're
going to try to avoid this as long as
possible. We feel we have an
obligation to our customers to keep
the price down as long as
possible."

The reason for the increase in the
price of coffee was a frost that
wiped out 70 percent of the
Brazilian crop, reducing the supply
to the United States. The price of
coffee will remain high until at
least 1979. when the Brazilian crop
is expected to be near normal levels
again. ‘

said he knew nothing about the

A inquiry or the case. “I don’t have

any knowledge of it,” he said
Friday. “I’ve not heard any details
and I can’t recall anyone who might
have ﬁled a discrimination charge. ’ ’

“It’s possible the matter has not
come to my attention,” Stark said.

Montgomery said yesterday that
Oskoui’s case had been under
consideration for some time. ‘ ‘Over
a year ago,” he said, “the Dean of
the School of Pharmacy recom-
mended, with the vice chancellor’s
endorsement, Oskoui’s dismissal
for incompetence. The Chancellor,
after considering the case, decided
not to take any steps at that time,
but rather to wait until June, 1977,
in order to give Oskoui a chance to
improve his record.

“This current year is his year of
trial, but he will not cooperate.. .will
not submit to any evaluation
procedures,” Montgomery said.
“To date, he has done nothing to
change our recommendation. He
has, however, taken steps in several
courts. Andmostrecently, there’s'
this letter from Washington.”

Oskoui, according to Edison, was
researching marijuana’s effects on
cats under a National Institute of
Health (NIH) grant.

Assevero, who works with the
House committee on Education and
Labor’s subcommittee on equal
opportunity, said any institution

receiving federal money (in this"

case NIH funds) is enjoined from

discriminatory practices by law, as a.

condition of those grants.
“Recipients of federal money,

NATHAN STARK P

including NIH funds, are bound
under law not to discriminate in any
aspect,” Assevero said. “That’s.a
condition attached to the money.

“It is not a formal Congressional
investigation at this point in
time—that depends on the results
‘of our further inquiry. The entire
matter will be investigated further,
against the threat of a formal
Congressional inquiry,” Assevero
said.

“We would hate to see a
Congressional investigation be-
cause it would be a waste of the
taxpayers’ money,” Montgomery
said. “But we would welcome it,
too, because we would be
vindicated completely. ’ ’

Co-op May Resume

Revisions Necessary

BY MAGGIE McKAY

The Student Government food
co-op, stalled since November due
to organizational problems, hopes

‘ to resume operation soon, after

structural changes have been
instituted, according to co-op
member Pat Gorley.

Some of the changes include a
reorganization of the co-op into
committees responsible for sched-
uling, buying, preparing and selling
the goods that are purchased in the
strip district.

Last term the co-op, which had
about 40-50 care workers, relied on
a loosely structured system of
volunteering where individual
workers signed up for speciﬁc
duties.

“The problem last term was that
no one was ever sure who was
supposed to be doing what. Hope-
fully, with committees, we’ll get
more people involved in decision
making so that they'll know how the
co-op works,” Gorley said.

Evans ordered the co-op mem-
bers to come up with a formal

method of assigning duties after the
co-op shut down the week before
Thanksgiving, and her decision on I
the new plan is expected on
Tuesday, according to Gorley. As
part of the reorganization, the co-op
will function with a faculty advisor,

Alberta" Sbragia, an assistant '-

professor in the political science
department.

.The co-op will eliminate the
pre-bagging of food orders-if the
new plan is approved, and make
future student food pick-ups more
of a market-type operation. _

A general meeting will be called
soon, Gorley said, to sign up new
members for the committee work.

‘ ‘Committees will make the co-op
more permanent. When people

leave, there will be enough workers V

who know how to make the co-op
run so that it can continue,” Gorley
said. p

All full-time undergraduate stu-
dents are considered members of
the co-op “because it is partially
funded by the student activities fee.
Part-time and graduate students
can become members for a $2 fee.

Panhellenic Elections
Scheduled For Tonight

BY BARB THOMAS

The Panhellenic Association’s
(Panhel) slating committee recently
picked ten Panhel members to run
for the five offices in Panhel’s
executive officers election tonight.

The slating committee, consis-
ting of the present executive board
and a representative from every
member sorority, reviewed all the

2 applications in a closed meeting and
decided which applicants were
suited to run for each of the five
ofﬁces.

A candidate for president of the
executive board must have a 2.5
grade point average and a candidate

9 for the board must have a 2.0 grade
point average.

No two__can~didates for thew_sa_1ne_

ofﬁ_ce could come from the same
sorority, Panhel president Diane
Kennedy said.

Graduate assistant to Panhel and
the InterFraternity Council Dan
Leifield said the method used to
pick the candidates for Panhel’s
executive offices was unnecessary.
“However,” he said, “if Pitt wants
to be a member of the National
Panhel Association it must run its
elections with the slating process. ”

The ten candidates include:
Chris Herrick and Kathy Faba for
president; Marcella Ricci and Gwen
Reichman for internal vice-presi-
dent; Debra Berzinski and Faye
Gershwin for external vice-presi-
dent; Ruth Hoffman and Cynde
Frederick for secretary; and Liz-
anue Gulish and Melanie Muslin for
treasurer.

    SGB|nput the Key  

As the years have passed, Student Government administrations have

’ accomplished less and less. An endless circle has evolved. The

government has become less responsive to student needs. Because of
this, students became apathetic; they ignored the govermnent and
provided no input. Without that input, the government lost track of
student needs and accomplished less and less.

This endless circle was not initiated by the inherent structure of the

seven-memberiboard. Actually, it was started by some of the people I

who ﬁlled the positions. Those who did nothing,  they
‘understood student needs or not. Those who skipped meetings, delayed
projects. Past boards have always had a few members hke that. They

_ crippled a board's effectiveness.

StudentGovernment president Barry Weisband has proposed,  the
form of Va referendumseeking student approval, the restructuring of

. Student Government.

If all members worked as hard as they could, the present system
would work. Asimple solution, then, would be to elect a board full of

7 , hard workers. But voters are not mind-readers and when an ineffective

board is elected the student body has to “wait ’til next year.”'

 Weisband has proposed a new system. The idea is to move away
from a system that is dependent on how hard-working the seven board
7 members are. The plan is to add a student assemblythat will keep track

of issues and advise the Board to provide input for decisions.
I I Essentially, this idea will help those lazy board members. No longer

    they have to go out and seek studentinput. The input will come to
/ them. The mountain now comes to Mohammed.

It’s an improvement, but not a panacea. Even with input provided, if 7

 skip meetings, delay projects and are generally lazy, all
the input in the world  will  nothing. ‘

Day‘? ’

The real reasons for the special
treatment of Martin Luther King
Day are two-fold. First of all,’ the
University Administration is beset
with a terminal case of “radical
chic" that compels it to go out of its
way to accomodate the “liberal"
elements of the community.
Second, the administration fears
that if the holiday is phased out. a
small number of agitators on
campus might be induced to start
trouble. It should be remembered
that a few years ago, a raucous

demonstration and sit-in were held

that resulted , among other things,
in the initial declaration of the
holiday.

If the administration wishes to
commemorate Dr. King's birthday,
let it do so, but only if other great
men and women are given the
same recognition. A modern
University should be open to all
views, not just those of a small but
vocal minority. Hopefully, the
situation will

omecoming Members

Needed Next Year

Coach Majors and the players on
the team have done their job in
boosting the name and spirit of
Pitt. We the Chairpersons of the
1977 Homecoming Committee are
challenging the students here to
duplicate that spirit by joining the
Homecoming Committee.

Being a member of the Home-
coming Committee isn’t a position
which should be taken ‘lightly.
Even though most people see
Homecoming as a one-week affair,
many months of behind the scenes
preparations are necessary for that
one week to be a success.

We’re not seeking just one type

of person, but individuals from all
sections of the student body.
Whether you are an active member
of anotherorganization or not, we
are looking for people with new
ideas and imagination to create a
unique Homecoming next fall.

We sincerely hope you will think
about this challenge and realize
that you have the capability to
make a change and add your
personal input into next fall’s
Homecoming.

Bron PELLEGRINI

There is something about foreign
cars that seem to make them

. popular among college students.

Oakland's parking lots seem to be
breeding grounds for Volkswagons,
Datsuns, Volvos, Toyotas, ~<,
Triumphs, Fiats and other cars of
that ilk.

Foreign cars, as we have been
toldin countless commercials, are
sporty, economical and cheap to
buy. They will run all day on an
eye-dropper of gas. They are sexy
and ingeniously designed, and
handle far better than those

. exercises in mediocrity put out by M

Detroit.
On snow, they sputter along in
places where Cadillacs and Fords

i fear to_ tread. And their ability to

squeeze into legal, unmetered
parking spaces can bring a tear to a
meter maid’s eye.

, By driving a foreign car, a student
shows that he is not willing to accept
the products of the American
system just because they are, in
fact, American. By driving a
foreign car, he shows that he is
willing to look at different, even

un-American ideas. Oldsmobiles
be damned! The college student is
a thinking individual. _

All of this was on my mind when I
recently purchased my ﬁrst car, a
used Volvo that seemed to be ‘in
excellent shape. ,

I’ve always liked Volvos. The car
has a modest elegance about it that
doesn’t go out of style after a few
years. The commercials for the car
show the U.S. Government (no less)
sending new Volvos careening
headlong into brickwalls. Insurance
companies offer discounts to Volvo
owners. -

Ihad pictured the car as having
some vague sports car quality about
it, but soon found out that what I
had was, after all, a Swedish family
car. It handles beautifully, gets
good gas mileage, is indecently

comfortable». and is built like a
tank—but unfortunately, acceler-
ates about as well. ‘

It was about two months after I
bought it that I decided to get the
car inspected—the ungodly sound

’ coming from my tailpipe (as well as

several complaining neighbors) told
meiI’d probably need a new mufﬂer.
I really started to worry when the
inspecting mechanic began to
giggle as he crawled under the car.
As he moved from the rear of the car
and advanced toward the front, the

Hints For Foreign Car Owners
Do You DriveA Lemon?

This proud owner of a new Mercedes Benz has a
contented smirk on his face. And why shouldn’t he?
He just bought himself a stylish, elegant foreign

car—the sleekest machine on the block. But give this

giggling got louder and by the time
he reached the front end, he was
laughing hysterically.

“Kid,” he said, as he wiped his
nose on his sleeve, ‘ ‘You need a new
left tie rod, left idler arm, whole new
exhaust system, lower ball joints,
and upper dental plates.”

“How much?” I whimpered.

“I ain’t really sure. I never could
afford to drive a Volvo.”

Someone once wrote that all
knowledge was painful. Whoever it
was must have owned a foreign car.
After quite a bit of ﬁnancial pain,
I’m beginning to learn how to cope
with the mechanized invaders froms»
abroad.

The ﬁrst thing I learned was the
If-You-Can’t-Pronounce-It-Don’t-
Buy-It rule. Or, simply: buy
American. Frankly, I've never been
too fond of American cars, yet when
my father recently sold his Dodge, it
had 115,00 miles on it and still was
going strong. It’s kind of hard to
argue with that kind of perfor-
mance. (Of course, most cars don’t
do that well, but when my father
needed a spare part at least he could

find it without sending away to
Goteborg, Sweden). .

Still, it is possible to maintain a
foreign car without much hurt by
doing a few simple things.

First, ﬁnd a good, honest
mechanic who knows how to work
on your particular make of car.
When you find him, be his friend,

buy him a drink, introduce him tog’ .

your sister, and.if‘possibIe, marry
him into your family. (If you’re
female, you could do a lot worse
than to have a mechanic for a
husband.)

Many foreign cars are, in fact,
ingeniously designed but that very
fact makes ﬁnding a competent
mechanic akin to ﬁnding the Holy
Grail. How many mechanics can
work on the computer-controlled
fuel injection system in a .Datsun

. 280Z or the power gull-wing doors

on the Canadian-made Bricklin?
Most mechanics spend an hour or so

» trying to find the engine on a foreign

car. _

If you ever meet a mechanic who
airily announces that all cars are the
same to work on, immediately know

him for the liar and braggart that he
is.

Next, be careful about buying
new parts. You might as well
resolve yourself to paying through
the nose for new parts. A quick
survey of ten automotive supply
stores in the area shows that parts
for foreign cars are two to three
times more expensive than compar-
able American systems.

Things like carburators, exhaust
systems, and electrical systems are
sometimes even more. Not only are
parts expensive, they are hard to
get. On all Volkswagons, the

carburetors run about $125 and take

over a week to obtain.

Some parts can be purchased only
at new car dealers’ who have a
sweet little parts racket going on
the sideline.They have a monopoly,
know it, and price accordingly.
This is especially true of Japanese
cars, the Mercedes and (alas‘
Volvos.

How to you get around it? If you
have time, there are some
mail-order companies that sell parts
at about two-thirds the price of a

dealer. If you use this service, you
had better know what parts you
need before you send away.

Mistakes will result in a few more .

weeks delay. Also, if you order

catalog number #5023h thinking it’s

an air ﬁlter (really hard to ﬁnd for
,some foreign cars) you may end up
: getting pink seat covers.

One of the better ways to get
parts is to buy them used. Usually,
you can get parts that are, for your
purposes, just as good as new ones
for less than half of the cost.

I needed a set of door-locks—the
originals had salted shut. New locks
would have cost me $78 (and this is
only a two-door model). But, I
heard that a man had a wrecked
Volvo in his garage and was selling

I quickly offered the
owner ten bucks, which he gleefully
accepted.

Instead of scavenging wrecked
cars yourself, there are used parts
places that do it for you. When I
needed myleft tie rod and idler arm
to pass inspection, the local Volvo
dealership wanted’ around $90 for
both parts. I picked them up used
for $30.

If you’re going to buy used parts,
make sure they are in good
condition. If you are going to install
the parts yourself, be extra careful
about the quality and if you have
any doubts, don’t buy them. A new
set of ball joints may be expensive
but not nearly so expensive as
having the body rebuilt (the car’s
body, as well as your own).

If you’re going to have a

mechanic install the parts for you, u

buy them on the stipulation that
you can return them if he doesn’t
like the quality of the part. Most
used parts places are happy to do
this; provided you show 3 receipt.

A foreign car owner has got to
treat his car as well as, if not better
than, his kid brother. He must have
the instinct of ' a vulture in
scavenging for parts. He has got to
get the most out of his dollar.

But this is a small price to pay in
order to experience the pleasure of a
good driving machine.

So, I'm going to ﬁx my Volvo until
it’s in mint condition, look at it with
prid‘e——and, then sell it to the first
sucker ‘that comes along, and buy a

‘Playing Straight And

Questionable Theatre

BY MREA CSORBA

They blow in from Milwaukee:
free'spirits of the theatre circuit,
bringing no props but their talents
with them, to release the fantasy
The Wreck: A Romance upon 99
cent Floating Theatre’s viewers
next week.

They’ve been in existence eight
years in a collective effort at
imaginative, effective drama, play-
ing the straight and the question-
able to audiences across America
and selectiveparts of Europe.

Theatre X. The name suggests
bizarre (or at least restricted)

H viewing. It is not.

The troupe uses good scripts:
The Measures Taken by Brecht,
Endgame by Beckett or Mister
Punch presented with an All in the
Family slant. They act in a physical
style, settingthis off with extreme
uses of light and shadow. This gives

I for a compelling visual piece.

Theatre X’s actors slip in and out
_of the available theatre media:
song, dance, and mime. This
contributes ﬂuidity to the produc-
tion. But the topping to their
repertoire is improvisation of the

already-memorized storyline. This .

brings the production to life. It is
also what the “X” in their name
stands for: the miscellaneous
elements in each presentation that
weren't part of the show in
rehearsal. _
_ Often noted for shearing drama,
the gift they bear for next week’s
(Thursday, Friday, Saturday and
Sunday, 8 p.m. at the Stephen
Foster Auditorium) audience is a
fantasy “about love, faith and the
problem of heroism in the modern
world.” ’
The Wreck: A Romance is a story
within a story, one of two ghosts
who inhabit the wreck of a ship. The
second tale enacts the dream of a
ﬁsherman. Together, the three go
diving for the ship’s treasures. The
ﬁnale of the play focuses on the

 

ﬁsherman and his claim to, and
possibility of, a sense of heroism
within his existence.

The Wreck: A Romance is the
second production of this season’s
99 cent Floating Theatre, being
presented in conjunction with the
Pennsylvania Repertory Theatre.
Their season’s initial offering is
G.B.S. in Love, a one-man show by
Canadian actor-scholar Dan Laur-
ence. It is based on letters
exchanged between George Ber-
nard Shaw and Alice Lockett.

just received a grant from the
Pennsylvania'Council on Arts to set
up a liason service between other
area theatre programs to bring in
innovative drama. It is not

‘Songs’ Key To Stevie’s Life  

BY TOM WASELESKI

Songs in the Key of Life, Stevie
Wonder.
Tamla Records, T-13-34062.

Last year when Paul Simon
picked up his Grammy for the
superb Still Crazy After All These
Years, he offered the traditional
thanks, then made the now famous
remark that he was most grateful for
Stevie Wonder’s not releasing an
album.

Stevie’s dogged presence in the
charts and at award nights has
been something for rock perform-
ers to contend with in the last
dozen years. For a star of Paul
Simon’s stature to let loose with
such a quip only underscores Stevie
Wonder’s formidable inﬂuence on
contemporary music.

lt’s almost a routine: a new
Wonder album, a couple of singles,
and in two or three years Muzak
and Andy Williams have a few new
standards to pick up on. Stevie’s
appeal is as broad as his quality is

consistent, and Songs in the Key of
Life ﬁnds the master in a lively key
indeed.

Paul Simon will be pleased he
didn’t put out this year, as Wonder
has two-and-a half album’s worth
of material here with which to best
‘him on Grammy or just about any
other night.

Anyone who hasn't already
heard the catchy “Sir Duke” or the
funky “I Wish” just doesn't own a
radio. The air play given this new
release is amazing, and, for once,
quite deserved.

Among the well-worn tracks over
the FM waves these days is “Isn’t
She Lovely,” a celebration in song
for his daughter. Although
somewhat marred by meaningless
background noise, Stevie’s blaring
harmonica solo in the second half
shows him in characteristic form.

Also high on the play list is “If
It’s Magic,” beautiful for its
simplicity in vocals and lyrics, and
“As,” a light. Wonder-ful rocker.

“Saturn” is one of four cuts on

4
=3»:--.

the extra 7-inch disc included in the
two-record set. A slow, plodding
song, it uses heavy bass and
well-placed synthesizer to add a
futuristic touch to the lyrics that
speak of a utopia called Saturn
“where people live to be two
hundred and five.”

On the ﬂip side is “Easy Goin’
Evening (My Mama’s Call),” a
cool, lazy, blues tune. Stevie sears
on mouth organ, as always.

Strong drumming with a Latin
ﬂair is featured on the eight-minute
“Another Star” by Nathan Alford,
Jr. on assorted percussion and
Carmello Hungria Garcia on
timbales.

On the other cuts_, too, Stevie
amasses ﬁne backup musicians,
some of the bigger names being
Herbie Hancock, George Benson
and Bobbi Humphrey.

The prim and sugary orchestrat-
ion in “Village Ghetto Land"
mocks the tragic conditions sung in
the lyrics, while the students’

company, who appeared in Pittsburgh last Friday night. Wagoner ‘

company.
for breath, and watched Regan Frey
solo to nature’s sounds——water,
rushes—-as if that’s all he ever
wanted to do.

For openers, a woman in a dinner
suit read numbers at exact intervals
from the Pittsburgh Press...one...
seven. . .six. . .ten, followed by front-
page stories and Donald Dingbat’s
weather forecast.

Meanwhile, the dancers, wearing
what probably were Danskins,
struck alert poses, wiggled and
leaped like fauns. A lot of the moves
were repetitious but later became
easily identiﬁable with the emotions
at which they hinted throughout the
evening.

The forms, asymmetrical with an
irregular tempo, raised tension to a
climax, then petered out like a
visual sonata, independent of the
sequiter readings.

“Songs,” like the other dances
choreographed by Wagoner, was
well executed, with vivacity and
energy, “by his company: Christo-
pher Banner, Heidi Bunting, Robert
Clifford, Regan Frey, Sally Hess,
JoAnn Jansen and Diann Perrelli.

Split asunder by the more serious
inclinations of life, the dances
stopped short of lightheartedness
and emphasized the heartbreaks

that come with any form of love to
music from Mendelssohn, Grieg,
Brahms and Dvorak.

“A Dance For Grace and

' Elwood,” was dedicated to Wag-

oner’s mother, Grace Runion

 

ii

Wagoner, and to his 96-year-olg ..,
father, Elwood H. Wagoner, living 8

in Springﬁeld, W.Va. The dancers
became ‘ ‘down-home country child-
ren” posing for family photos,
romping and strutting at a
hoedown.

When Dan Wagoner and Dancers

began to emerge in 1968, Wagoner

had danced with Doris Humphrey,

Martha Graham and Merce Cun-

. ningham and toured the world as a

leading soloist with the Paul Taylor
company.

In addition to regular concerts in 9 ‘—’-‘

New York, the company has made
two visits to the Teatro Municipal in
Caracas,» Venezuela. Under the
auspices of the Department of State
and the United States Information
service, it toured India and
Pakistan, in addition to touring the
United States.

The performance, sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Dance Council, was
dedicated to Cecil Kitcat, one of the
council’s founders, who died Dec.
30.

You don’t have to look very hard to see the worried look of Pitt head
coach Tim Grgurich, who has seen the Panthers with the larger

scoreboard number only three times this season.

BY CRIS HALL

PHILADELPHIA—-It was a
long, class-free weekend for Pitt
students because of Friday’s
University holiday, but don’t tell
that to Tim Grgurich and his
Panther basketball team. They had

to suffer through more lessons than.

they would have liked.

the Pitt track team as it successfully

The Panthers started their clean
sweep in the mile run, where Tom
Herrmann captured the top spot
with an excellent early-season time

'» of 4:13.4. Herrmann was closely

followed by second-place ﬁnisher
Ron Wirick, with his best iniletime

Living up to tradition, the mile-
and two-mile relay teams each
captured ﬁrst place. The winning
mile relay team of Bud Cooper,
Larry Shippen, Carpenter and Keith
Leckenby had a time of 3:26.5. A

The two-mile relay turned out to

‘ be a competitive battle between the

two Pitt teams, with the non-scoring
“B” team coming out on top. The
team of Terry Wile, McDonald,
Boyd and Rich Markley nosed out
the team of Tom Fitzgerald, Roger

Saturday. “I think we got off to a

we got killed...when they pressed,
we were lost.”

Lost they were. Add bewildered,
hapless and ineffectual, and you get
the picture of how easy a prey Pitt
was. ~

“We played weird,” said Grgur-
ich. “We played some very weird
basketball.”

Villanova, last year’s Big Five
co-champ and a member of the
EIBL’s Eastern Division, was the
benefactor in a very “weird” ﬁrst
half. ,Pitt shot an astounding 65
percent in the opening 20 minutes-
but took only 20 shots. The
Panthers had trouble putting two

idribbles together in the backcourt,

and a completed pass was rare. And
when Pitt did get within shooting
range but missed, Villanova cleared
the boards. Pitt had just two
offensive rebounds in the ﬁrst half.

As a result, Villanova, which shot
only 43 percent, took a 39-28 lead
after one half and 17 Pitt turnovers.

Also, as a result, Pitt’s two top
scorers missed their averages by a
mile. A strong ﬁnish gave Larry
Harris 14 points to tie him with Mike
Rice for Panther honors.

But perhaps the most startling
thing the Panthers learned is that
Sonny Lewis, one of the biggest
plusses in this so-far minus season,
is still a freshman and—incredibly
—can go scoreless for an entire
game. Sonny took one shot, had it
blocked, and didn’t shoot again. He
picked up ﬁve rebounds and four

‘assists.

Despite the offensive thrusts of All-Agnerican Larry Harris, shown
scoring against Cleveland State, the Panthers fell to their eleventh

defeat in 14 outings on Saturday.

In his latest heroics, Stepanovich
dominated, Lycoming’s Bruce
Driver, 12-0, to assure the Panthers
a still-perfect season.

“The team kept patting me on
the back and urging me on,"
Stepanovich said. ‘‘I couldn’t
afford not to give it my best shot. I
hope we can continue to come back
like that in our remaining
matches.”

“I thought I, could take ‘him

“but the coach and I didn’t want to

‘ take chances on trying a take—down

and losing.”

That tie, along with another
standstill by Panther Bill Clara"
(118)., proved crucial.

“Those two ties - were im-
portant,” Adams agreed. “If Clark
or Arndt were to have lost Ila"
match, we would have lost.”

After Gordon got the ball rolling,
Slip Bolin (167) kept it going by
destroying helpless Tom Spruill,

at 19-11.

“I ﬁgured we wouldn’t be
behind as far as we were," Bolin
stated. “Their guys were stalling,
trying to hang on for the win.”

By this time, Lycoming (6-3)
must have felt its luck wasn't
exactly booming. And a tie by Pitt’s
Don Arndt (177) didn’t help the
visitors feel any better. ‘

Arndt battled back from 2-0

Parsons, whose‘ blatant stalling

“He kept covering up the stall,”
Bailey explained, “by making on

Gymnasts Short-Changed

Considering the fact his team had

“just been the victim of two scoring

changes, each of which could have
prevented a loss to a favored Navy
team, Pitt men’s gymnastic coach lg
Perez was a calm, happy man after
his team’s 180.70 - 180.50 defeat to

Trees Hall.

But when one thinks about the

be pleased with. The Panthers
Woutclassed West Virginia Univer-
Vity, 180.60 - 150.55, Friday night,
then came back with a ﬁne
performance against Navy, almost
pulling out a win. .
“It was such a fantastic meet,”
Perez said after the Navy encoun-
ter. “When you consider each man
has 11 moves, with each man
judged on ten points, and each of
the ten points is divided into tenths,
what are the odds of two teams tying

iv like that?”

In fact, Pitt and Navy did not

. able was an incorrect one, and it '

just enough to win the meet. After
Pitt’s Keith Wipperecht completed
his routine on the high bar, Navy
coach Bill Savering spoke to Head
Judge Kenneth Chieffo. A meeting
of all four judges ensued, the result
being Wipperecht’s score was
lowered by three-tenths. After the
meet, the Pitt coaches complained
that Savering had inﬂuenced the
score, a clear violation of the rules.
A protest by Pitt is likely to be filed.

“The question is a technical
one,” Judge Chieffo explained. “It
is whether or not a coach can come
out and determine a score. But the
score is ofﬁcial as ﬂashed.”

Despite the controversy, Perez
still had much to be happy about.

“The outstanding thing was the
performance of Keith Wipper-
echt,” the fourth-year coach said.
“He has had about four percent
success lately on his parallel bars
routine but he had an incredible
performance in both meets. He was
the MVP of the West Virginia meet.

[Saturday Keith repeated his

performance, which is nearly
impossible. It is like giving a
freshman the ball for the ﬁrst time
in a football game and having him
run 100 yards with it.”

Leading the Panthers in the two
meets was senior Rob Pasterick,
who grabbed the all-around title
both nights with scores of 48.70
against WVU and 49.20 Navy.
Against the Mountaineers, Paster-
ick placed ﬁrst on the rings, parallel
bars, vault and high bars, then on

the following night took the ﬂoor
exercises and repeated his high bar
win.

Other Panther winners against
West Virginia were Tom Biers in the
ﬂoor exercises and Don Stevenson
on the pommel horse. Stevenson,
the second Panther all-arounder,
after Pasterick, was injured on
Saturday night but, according to
Perez, still turned in some fine
performances.

‘ ‘Don did an outstanding job with
a sore shoulder,” Perez said. “He
put together _a high bar routine he
hasn’t practiced in a month. He did
a great job considering the pain he
was 1n.”

Navy managed to edge the
Panthers by relying on individual
performers, not on their all-
arounders—a direct contrast to
Pitt. Navy captured the pommel
horse, rings, vault and parallel bars
each one taken by an event
specialist.

What none of the officials
discussed was what the result will
be if the Panthers win their protest
over the Midshipmen. ’

“It is so technical,” Perez said.
“The ‘rules are so complicated I
don’t know what will happen.”

There is one thing of which Perez
is certain. Next Saturday his
Panthers will travel to Philadelphia
to visit a powerhouse Temple team
in another tough test for his
gymnasts.

Panthers Tumble Again,
Facing Tough Road Card

(Continued from Page 10)

Also working against Pitt
throughout the game was a hot
Herron half—a 16-point ﬁrst half by
6-6 junior Larry Herron, and a
17-point ﬁnal period by senior
brother Keith. Larry finished with
20 points and seven rebounds, and
Keith totalled 22 points, with five
rebounds.

Though the Panther offense
gained most of the attention in
Philadelphia, the defense was
noteworthy, also. The amoeba,
Fran Webster’s prize product that
carried Pitt teams to the NIT and the

NCAA Eastern Regional finals, has

been mutated. Not junked
completely, but simplified enough
to give Pitt’s younger inside players
a chance Tintil they can learn it and
put it to devastating use. K

“We aren’t pressing as much as
we used to,”

said Scheuermann.

“And we’ve been working a lot
more on the zone. In the games,
we’re coming back- into the zone a
lot more...of course, that's one
option of the amoeba, but that's the
one we’re using most of the time.”

The Panthers’ tutors in the near
future will be learned professors
with impressive credentials. Syra-
cuse, which beat West Virginia by
15 ‘Saturday, is next, with Pitt
traveling there for a ‘Saturday
contest. Then it’s off to South Bend

' to meet previously second-ranked

Notre Dame before a University
Park date with Penn State. And
after that it’s second-ranked
Cincinnati at home. And later, at
West Virginia and Maryland. And
after that...

“I just wish I knew when it will
end,” said _Grgurich. “We’re
learning, but I don’t know when it
will end.”
