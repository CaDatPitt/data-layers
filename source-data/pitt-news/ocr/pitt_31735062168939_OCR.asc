(Editor’s note: This is the first llment of a two-part series,
analyzing not only the new Black Action Society which appeared on
campus in the months following the ,assassination of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, but also the inner-workings of the University.

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

Hardly any individual believes that this nation’s university
campuses are hotbeds of racial inequity and white racism. But
this is certainly the case. Consciously or unconsciously profes-
sors, administrators, and students live and participate in a cam-
pus atmosphere that exhumes the stench of white racism. And

no university is really an exception to this disturbing rule.
The University fits into this national pattern. We are a

1 medium sized university dedicated to the concept of academic

excellence -and community service. In this sense, the Univer-
jsity’s‘complex racial situationhcan serve as a valid case study
"in extracting the forthcoming racial patterns on the nation’s

‘university campuses.

For the past 12 years the University has been expanding.-

Dormitories have been constructed. The size and quality of the
faculty has increased. And student enrollment has increased.
But with all of this expansion, no provisions weretmade for
black people. No programs were initiated that -might improve
the racial inequity that presently exists.

The University is state-re-
lated. Consequently much of
the University’s financial aid
must be passed by a vote of
the Pennsylvania State Legis-
lature. This adds a financial
dimension to the race prob-
lem, for the State Legislature
in Pennsylvania is not known
for its progressive ideas.

Even with thisdire situation,
th e administration headed by
Chancellor Wesley Prosvar has
made some serious attempts to
combat white racism. In a recent
meeting of the University’s Fac-
ulty Senate, Vice Chancellor of
Finance Edison Montgomery stat-
ed that he wanted “to hire all
qualified ‘Negroes’ even if a bet-
ter qualified white candidate was
available.” He reported that “ev-
ery effort has been made to give
priority to Negroes in our hiring.
This policy has been implement-
ed by actively working with 10-
cal employment agencies with
systematic visits to high schools
attended primarily by ‘Negroes.’ ”
Montgomery said.

N 0 Progress

1 With all of this effort, the Uni-

- versity has not moved ahead. Out

of approximately 2,000 faculty
and professional staff, the Uni-
versity now employs merely 71
Blacks. Out of a pool of 1,031
technicians only 97 are black. Of
39 security personnel, four are
black. There are three black em-
ployees in the Craft Union, and
most significantly, there are 272
blacks in a semi-skilled worker
pool of 811. While the University
has attempted to equalize its
white-black employment ratios,
the largest percentage of Black
employees is in the semi-skilled
worker pool.

Furthermore, the University
uses discriminatory selection de-
vices for employment. The Per-

sonnel Department at the Univer-'

sity requires that the Wunderlich
Intelligence Test be taken by all
job applicants. University Social
Psychologist Aubrey H o 1 la n d
rightfully m a i n t a i n s that the
Wunderlich test is culturally bi-
ased, and that “too high a cut-off
point on the Wunderlich can re-
sult in ruling out for job consi-
deration Blacks who in fact may
be very well qualified for a par-
ticular job.” -

The University has also made
attempts at increasing Black stu-
dent enrollment. By law, the Ad-
missions Office cannot ask the
race of an applicant. Thus, as one
admissions officer explains, its

next to impossible to predict the
future percentages of black stu-
dents. The statistics concerning
black students reveal the difficul-

— ty the University has had in at-

tracting a more equitable racial
balance in the overall student
population. Vice C h a n c e l 1 o r
Montgomery points out that black
students comprise one per cent
of the total student population. In
numbers, this means that present-
ly there are only 170 Black stu-
dents enrolled at a University
whose total student population
numbers 16,000. These figures
point to the past‘ failure of the Ad-
missions office to attract a signi-
fica‘nt number of black students.

Set Up Committees

The students, faculty, and ad-
ministration continued to make
proposals and set up committees
to study various plans to combat
the racial inequities but there
was no real impetus to implement
these liberal programs. In short,
the University was floundering-
it needed a jolt to awaken it. And
the jolt was unfortunately the as-
sassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. After Dr. King’s tragic
death, a great many proposals
were issued. Medical School Pro-
fessor Dr. Henry Finck issued a
list of demands to the adminis-
tration. The demands called for
the establishment of a Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. endowed
chair, the creation of a black
studies program, the inclusion
into the library of a Martin Lu-
ther King collection of books that
highlights black culture and
black history, and a full scaled
attempt of the University to in-
crease black enrollment and em-
ployment.

In response to Dr. Finck’s list

of demands the University initi--

ated a study to combat white ra-
cism. Dr. Donald Hugh Smith,
an eminent black scholar on in-
ner city problems, was hired as
head of the University’s Office of
Community Education. Universi-
ty Provost Dr. Charles Peake an-
nounced that some 20 programs
“which have as their goal improv-
ing the educational level of the
disadvantaged are planned.” But
Dr. Peake admitted that “to date
these programs have not been co-
ordinated in any significant fash-
ion.’’

In addition to the programs af-
fecting the University, Dr. Peake
also announced the planning of a
program in cooperation with 10-
cal school officials and leaders
of the Pittsburgh Black Commun-
ity. Dr. Peake_said, “This, pro-

 

‘CURTIS PORTER
Black Action Society Program Chairman

gram is designed to provide a
stimulating environment to pre-
school ‘children from disadvan-
taged areas.”

It should be noted that most of
these proposals w ere initiated
within the administration. That‘
is, the proposals were initiated
without, for the most part, a black
man’s perspective; without a black
man’s advice. Here, an unconsci-
ous white racism was evident.
University Faculty members list-
ed their demands to aid the black
man in his quest for true equality.
The white power structure of the
University was lending its help-
ing hand ‘to the black man- And
this spirit of the white man’s bur-
den to aid the “underprivileged”
is at the core of whte racism.

Black ‘s View

But how does the black student
perceive the University; what
does he see? Well, black students
here maintain that white racism
is built into the structure of the
University — it is the result of cur-
riculum, enrollment figures, and
the unconscious attitude that de-
picts the missionary spirit of the
white man’s burden. In an inter-
view, 25 black students felt that
the University is not place
where a black is called a “nig-
ger.” At the University there is
what Joe McCormick; a black stu-
dent from Washington, D. C.,
calls “institutionalized preju-
dice. This type of prejudice,”
says McCormick, “is not really
blatant name calling; it involves
incidents that constantly occur.”

A case of this unconscious but
essentially hostile racism centers
around University Housing Ad-
ministrator Miss Lorraine Sibbitt.
Three black co—eds enrolled here
requested through Miss Sibbitt’s
office permission to room
together. Miss Sibbitt told the
three students that their request
was out of the question. One of
the black co-eds objected to Miss

Sibbitt’s reasoning citing . racial
prejudice as the primary factor
in her decision. After relucantly
blurping, “Oh for heavens sake.”
Miss Sibbitt granted the request.

Miss Sibbitt did not call the

black co—eds “niggers.” She mere- ‘

ly felt that she was doing her
duty by helping these black co-
eds to make‘the proper roomate
choice — a choice that would

BLACK ACTION SOCIE’I‘Y—-sitting at meeting. .

rightfully expose them to white
living patterns. She did not con-
sider the sentiments of the black
co—eds.

At one time this unconscious
racism was the cause for a great
deal of apathy on the part of
black students. One very arti-
culate black student stated: “I
don’t believe that any black is.
really accepted. We aren’t ac-
cepted in totality by Pitt’s ad-
ministration, faculty or by our
white peers,” This apathy caused _
black membership in the Hill Ed-

ucation Project (HEP) —- an organ-‘

say that the white man’s heaven
at this University is the black

in the minority at Pitt, and it is
a minority that the white major-
ity at the University looks upon
with great sympathy — the sympa-
thy so very well depicted by the
missionar zeal of the white man’s
burden.

This was the overall situation

burgh riots engulfed this city. Be-
fore the riots the black commun-
ity on campus was a silent dis-
possessed minority. But after the
riots a new fervor of black iden-
tification became evident on cam-
pus. More and more black,stu-
dents were rejecting the old term
“Negro”; they were rejecting the
old fashioned motherhood and ap-
ple pie paternalism that had been
exhibited by the administration.
The result of this new trend of
sweeping black identificationand
pride was the formation .of the
Black Action Society (BAS). The
BAS has become, in the short
span of three months, the basic
representative of the black com»
munity on campus. They reject’
the old ways of black «humility
and the “wait and see” method-
olgy.

by GERALD FARBER

Students are niggers. When you get that straight, our
schools begin to make sense. It’s more important, though, to
understand why thy’re niggers. If we follow that question
seriously enough, it will lead us past the zone of academic

"bullshit, where dedicated teachers pass their knowledge on to a

new generation, and into_ the nitty-gritty of human needs and
hang-ups. And from there, we can go on to consider whether
it might ever be possible for students to come up from salvery.

First, let’s see what’s happening now. Let’s look at the role
students play in what we like to call education.

At Cal State L. A.. where I
teach the students have separate

and unequal dining facilities. If I

take them into the faculty dining
room, my colleagues get uncomfor-
table, as though there were a bad
smell. If I eat in the student cafe-
teria, I become known as the edu-
cational equivalent of- a nigger
lover. In at least one building.
there are even rest rooms which
students may_ not use. At Cal
State, also, there is an unwritten
law barring student—faculty love-
making. Fortunately, this anto -
miscegenation law, like its South-
ern counterpart, is not 100 per
cent effective.

Students at Cal State are pol-
itically disenfranchised. They are

in an academic Lowndes Coun-

ty. Most of them can vote in na-
tional elections — their average
age is about 26 — but they have
no voice in the decisions which
affect their academic lives. The
students are, it is true, allowed to
have a toy government of their
own. It is a government run for

r ‘ the most part by Uncle Toms and
_concerned principally with tri-

via.» The faculty and administra-
tors decide what courses will be
offered; the students get to choose
their own Homecoming Queen.
Occasionally, when student lead-
ers get uppity and rebellious,
they’re either ignored. put off
with trivial concessions, or maneu-
vered expertly out of position.

A student at Cal State is ex-

. pected to know his place. He calls

a faculty member “Sir” or “Doc—
tor” or “Professor” —— and he smil-
es and shuffles some as he stands
outside the professors office wait-
ing for permission to enter. The
faculty tell him what courses to

. take (in my department, Engnsh.
-even electives have to be approved

by a faculty member): they tell
him what to read, what to write,
what’s true and what isn’t. Some
teachers insist that they ecourage
dissent but they’re almost always
jiving and every student knows
it. Tell the man what he wants
to hear or he’ll fail your ass out
of the course. -

‘Jump Boy’

‘ When a teacher says “jump."
students jump. I know of one pro-
fessor’wh‘o refused to take up class
time for exams and required stu-
dents to show up for tests at 6:30
in the morning. And they did. by

, .God! Another, at exam time. pro-
3 vides answer cards to be filled out

.— each one enclosed in a paper
baggwith a hole cut in the top to
see through, Students stick their

.writing hands in the bags while

taking the test. The teacher isn't
a provo: I wish he were.

"He does it to prevent cheating.
Another coleague once caught a
student reading during one of his
book
against the wall. Still another lec-
tures his students into stupor and

2 then screams at them in a rage

when they fall asleep.

 '.Jus_tM.lastA week;- during'the.first 

meeting of a class. one girl got
up to leave after about ten min-
utes had gone by. The teacher
rushed over. grabbed her by the
arm. saying. “This class is NOT
dismissed!” and led her back to
her seat. On the same day. another
teacher began by informing his
class that he does not like beards.
mustaches, long hair on boys. or
capri pants on girls. and will not
tolerate any of that in his class.
The class, incidentally. consisted
mostly of high school teachers.

Disco uragement

Even more discouraging than

.this Auschwitz approach to edu-

cation is the fact that the students
take it. They haven’t gone through
twelve years of public school for
nothing. They’ve learned one
thing and perhaps only one thing
during those twelve years. They'-
ve forgotten their algebra. They’re
hopelessly vague about chemistry
and physics. They’ve grown to
fear and resent literature. They
write like they’ve been lobotom—

ized. But,‘Jesus'. can they follow .

orders! Freshmen come up to me
with an essay and ask if I want it
folded and whether their name
should be in the upper right hand
corner. ‘And I want to cry and
kiss them and caress their poor
tortured heads.

Students don’t ask that orders
make sense. They give up expec-
ting to make sense long before
they leave elementary school.
Things are truebecause the teach-
er says they’re true.‘ At a very ear-
ly age. we all learn to accept “two
truths,” as did certain medieval
churchmen. Outside of class.
things are true to your tongue.
your fingers, your stomach. your
heart. Inside class, things are true
by reason of authority. And that's
just fine because you don’t care
anyway. Miss Wiedemeyer tells
you a noun is a person. place or
thing. So let it be. You don't give
a rat's ass; she doesn’t give a rat‘s
ass. . -

The important thing is to please
her. Back in kindergarten. you
found out that teachers only love
children whose stand in nice
straight lines. And that’s where
it’s been ever since. ‘

What school amounts to. then.
for white and black kids alike.
is a 12-year course in how to be

slaves. What else could explain

what I see in a freshman class?
They’ve got that slave mentality:
obliging and ingratiating on the
surface but hostile and resistent
underneath. ' ‘

Black Slaves

As do ‘black slaves. students
vary in their awareness of what’s
going on. Some recognize their
own put-on for what it is and even
let their rebellion break through
to the surface now and then.
Others —— including most of the
"fgood students” — have been

‘more deeply brainwashed.‘ They

mouths. They‘re pathetically ea-
ger to be pushed around. They're
like those old grey-headed house
niggers you can still find in the
South who don’t see what all the
fuss is about because Mr. Charlie
“treats us real good.”

College entrance "requirements
tend to favor the Toms and screen
out the rebels. Not entirely. of
course. Some students at Cal State
L. A. are expert con artists who
know perfectly well what‘s hap-
pening. They want the degree or
the 2-S and spend their years on
the old plantation alternately
laughing and cursing as they play
the,game. If their egos are strong
enough. they cheat a lot. And. of
course. even the Toms are angry
down deep somewhere. But it
out in passive rather than active
aggression. They’re unexplainably
thickwitted and subject to fre-
quent spells of laziness. They mis-
read simple questions. They spend
their nights mechanically outlin-

ing, history chapters while me“c-,

ulously failing to comphrehend
a word of whats in front of them.

The saddest cases among both
black slaves and student slaves
are the ones who have so thorough-
ly introjected theirmasters‘ val-
ues that their anger is all turned
inward. At Cal State. these are
the kids for whom every low grade
is torture. who stammer and
shake when they speak to a pro-
fessor, who go through an emotion-
al crisis every time they’re cal-
led upon during calss. You can re-
cognize them easily at finals time.
Their faces are festooned with
fresh pimples; their bowels boil
audibly across the room. If there
really is a Last Judgment. the

parents and teachers who crea-

ted these wrecks are going to burn
in hell.

So students are niggers. It’s
time to find out why, and to
this. we have to take a long look
at Mr. Charlie.

The teachers I know best are
college professors. Outside the
classroom and taken as a group,
their most striking characteristic
is timidity. They're short on balls.

Working Conditions _

Just look at their woriking con-
ditions. At a time when even
migrant workers have begun to
fight and win, college professors
are still afraid to make more than
a token effort to improve on their
pitiful economic status. In Cali-
fornia state colleges. the faculties
are screwed regularly and vigor-
ously by the Governor and Legis-
lature and yet they still won’t
offer any solid resistance. They
lie flat on their stomachs with

. their pants down. mumbling catch
phrases like “professional digni-.

ty” and “meaningful dialogue.”
Professors were no different

when I was an undergraduate at

UCLA during the McCarthy era;

it was like a cattle stampede as

they rushed to cop out. And in
more recent years, ‘IA-foundathat
' ' " I‘ 'it.- -- .-Q. “‘

 

  

brought fromgmy colleagues not so

- much approval or condemnation

as open-mouthed astonishment.
“You could lose your job! “

Now, of course. there’s the Viet-
namese war. It gets some oppos-
ition from a few teachers. Some
support it. But a vast number of
professors who know perfectly
well what’s happening, are cop-
ping out again. And in the high
schools, you can forget it. Stil-
lness reigns.

' I'm not sure why teachers are so
chickenshit. It could be that aca-
demic training itself forces a split
between thought and action. It
might also be that the tenured se-
curity of a teaching job attracts
timid persons and, furthermore,
that teaching, like police work,
pulls in persons who are unsure
of themselves and need weapons
and the other external trappings
of authority. -

At any rate, teachers ARE short
on balls. And. as Judy Eisenstein-
has eloquently pointed out, the
classroom offers an artificial and
protected environment in which
they can exercise their will to
power. Your neighbors may drive
a better car; gas station attend-
ants may intimidate you; your
wife may dominate you; the State
Legislature may shit on you; but
in the classroom, by God, students
do what you say — or else. The
grade is a hell of a weapon. It
may not rest on‘ your hip. potent
"and rigid like a cop’s gun. but in
the__ long run its more powerful.
At your personal whim — any time
you choose — you can keep 35
students up for nights and have
the pleasure of seeing them walk
into the classroom pasty-faced
and red-eyed carrying a sheaf of
typewritten pages, with title
page, MLA footnotes and margins
set at 15 and 91.

General Timidzty

The general timidity which
causes teachers to make niggersof
their students usually includes a
more specific feat — fear of the stu-
dents themselves. After all, stu_-
dents are different like black peo-
ple. You stand exposed in front of
them, knowing that their interests,
their values and their language are
different from yours. To make mat-
ters worse, you may suspect that
you yourself are not the most en-
gaging of persons. What then can
protect you from their ridicule
and scorn? Respect for Authori-
ty. That’s what. It’s the police-
man’s gun again. The white
bwana’s pith helmet. So you flaunt
that authority. You wither wisper—
ers with a murderous g‘:mce. You
crush objectors with erudition and
heavy irony. And worst of ‘all, you .
make your own attainments seem
not accessible but awesomely re-
mote. You conceal your massive
ignorance - and parade a slen-
der learning.

causes, some of which are bet-

ter described in sociological than 

psychological terms. Work them_

out, it’s not hard. But in the mean- ‘

time, what we’ve got on our hands
is a whole lot of niggers.
what makes this particularly grim

is that the student has less chance 
than the black man of getting out L

of his bag. Because the student
doesn’t even know'he’s in it. That,
more or less, is what’s happening

in higher education. And the re- *

sults are staggering.

For one thing, damn little edu-
cation takes place in the schools.
How could it? You can’t educate
slaves; you can only train them.

Or, to use an even uglier word, I

you can only program them.
Oppression

Educational oppression is trick- ,

ier to fight than racial oppres-
sion. If you’re a black rebel, they

can’t exile you; they either have - I

to intimidate you or kill you. But
in high school or college, they

can just bounce you out of the ‘

fold. And they do. Rebel students
and renegade faculty members get
smothered or shot down with dev-
astating accuracy. In high school,
it’s usually the student who gets
it; in college, it’s more often the
teacher. Others get tired of fight-
ing and voluntarily leave the sys-
tem. This may be a mistake
though. Dropping out of college,

for a rebel, is a little like going e

North, for a Negro. You can’t real-
ly get away from it so you might
as well stay and raise hell. ' ‘

How do you raise hell? That’s

a whole other article. But just I

for a start, why not stay with the
analogy? What have black people

done? They have, first of all, ‘

faced the fact of their slavery.

They’ve stopped kidding ..them— ‘

selves about an eventual reward
in theat Great Watermelon Patch

they’ve decided to_ get freedom

Students, like black people,
have immense unused power.
They could, theoretically, insist

‘participating in their own educa-

freedom bilateral. They could
teach their teachers to thrive on
love and admiration, rather than
fear and respect, and to lay down
their weapons. Students could dis-

cover community. And they could ,

P-Bus)’ Themse1Ves In Unawareness

Well . . . . after explaining to
Jeff Bauman that The Pitt News
reserves the right to cover student
organizations through a journal-
istic analysis; rather than be spoon-
fed by each group’s publicity
chairman . . . he soon left.

But when he left, the words
“student power” resounded again’
and again in the office. Student
power; yes SG President Ken
Schueler had said the very same
thing. Student power; two words
which haven’t meant much at Pitt
in a long long time.

For the only two realisms, facts
of life, around here are:

(1) The sun doesn’t shine very
often, and

(2) Students don’t know what’s
going on.

Pitt students seem to be in a
state of unawareness; precipitated
by the ethnic orientated preju-
dices of this University and this
entire area. Each student has his
clique; and to get what he feels
is either campus status or joyous
fulfillment, he is willing to cut
the throat of any person in an-
other clique.

Blood runs swiftly and quietly.

At a large University, such as
this, maybe cliques are best. Se-
curity-wise, there ‘is no doubt it
is. But cliques screw themselves’.

‘ Each one works towardthe same
goal, through different means. But
each one is always waiting and
looking to see what it can gain.
When the golden ring is before
them, each one grabs at it; and
then retreats. ~.

And once more, the University

‘returns to its rigid way of life.

We’re Not (Sic) Stereotyped

When Dr. Richard Rubenstein began French 180

:We are contented. We identify with a small’

we criticize or show prejudice toward those who
are not like us. We "all think our way is .t'h‘e."b’est’

going to raise holy hell this year. They can’t turn

 C. R. Faces Racial Problem
And Proposes Suggestions

I

/Q P- . by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The summer months witnessed

_ ‘ . scores of racial incidents_ ignited
" “fby dissatisfaction and a lack of-

communication between races.

Q ,_-’But at the University, the problem

_.of racism was being faced square-

-. ly and alleviations suggested.

 ‘ This was accomplished by the
 establishment of the University
7' _ .Committee on racism (UCR) com-

,  posed of faculty and administra-

’ tion members. The UCR was set

up in response to a petition pre-

. . sented to the faculty Senate on
' June 3 by Dr. Henry Finck, pro-
’ lfessor of Anatomy.

Black Action Society (BAS) assis-
ted the faculty members. Recent-
ly established, the BAS, accord-
ing to its charter, “is the organi-
zation of the Black Community
on the campus of the University
of Pittsburgh. ”

Almost immediately, the tac-
tics of the UCR were effective in
gaining an increase in black stu-
dent enrollment and black facul-
ty members at the University.

..Changes in curricula and texts
were also promoted. Courses in
Afro-American history, art, an-
thropology and other areas of

V, study have been or are in the

Signed by eighteen faculty mem-

bers, the petition read:

' "A “We the undersigned faculty

members of the University of

‘ Pittsburgh recognize that the Uni-

versity has been and still is a
racist institution. We are pledged
to correct this situation immedi-

‘ ately.”

The first four meetings of the
UCR worked out its membership
and organization. By June 24,

;,the ranks of active participants

had’ doubled and a program of
five task forces was taking shape.

O The areas covered by the re-

‘ spective task forces included:

Academic Programs at Pitt.
Pitt and the Labor Market.

‘ Pitt and the Public Schools.
Involvement with the Commun-

4' ity in other Problem Areas.

The University's own Problem
of Racism.

Throughout the organization of
the task forces, members of the
local black community and the

process of being coordinated.

Plans of the Book Center in-
clude the addition of a section
“devoted to blacks by blacks.”

By its meeting of July 8, fur-
ther proposals had been discussed
and adopted. Dr. Robert H. Gib-
son, doctor of Psychology and
secretary of the UCR, termed the

changes “small, but significant
victories."
One immediate accomplish-

ment involved abandonment of
the Wonderlic “quickie” Intelli-
gence Test used in job screening.
The test was thought to be “cul-
turally-biased against hard-core
people, both black and white.”

Other proposals were aimed at
cooperation with the BAS. One
involved commissioning the BAS
to work with the Admissions Of-
fice for recruitment purposes
and another was an offer by fac-
ulty members to provide counsel-
ors for the BAS on a man-to-man

basis.

Also planned is “further exami-
nation of the curricula and cur-
rent departments by faculty mem-
bers in light of their recognition
of the relevance of the Black Cul-
ture.”

Both the ranks and the endeav-
ors of the UCR had swelled by
July 22, the seventh meeting of
the group. ’

Dr. Gibson reported that “we
now have upwards of 90 names
of interested people. Some refuse
to come to the general meetings
on the grounds that most of the
work is accomplished in outside
workshops.”

Task force chairmen informed
fellow faculty that Reading Labs
for special students and training
films for faculty members had
been set up. A series of future
sessions with the Dean’s Coun-
cil wasalso tossed around as a
possibility. .

By this point, the faculty mem-
bers had reached a first name
basis with one another. The infor-
mality encouraged open discus-
sion' and an atmosphere in which
some faculty members felt free
to wear shorts and other sports
clothes to the meetings.

New Visual Experience

Pittsburgh’s next light show will
take place October 4, at the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel despite pressure
from various groups. Earlier in
the summer, organizers of the
show printed a pamphlet adver-
tising it as a “chance to come
together physically” and “exper-
ience your first visual orgasm.”
These pamphlets were distributed
on the street in Oakland, Squirrel
Hill, and "Shadyside. Many people
were offended by the language
and complained to the Hotel.

“The William Penn H o t el

pite the fact that we had signed a

made us tear up all the circulars

If there is no more trouble, the
light-show will be “an event in
a City of no-events.” They will
use over 12 projectors and a var-
iety of strobe lights and colored
slides. The changing lights will
mix together on the walls and
move in time to live music. Over
a’ thousand people will come to-
gether and “experience something
that people in Pittsburgh have
never experienced before.”

for five months.

Businessmen were demanding
more private enterprise. From
longer haired students came pleas
for more Western_music: the Bea-
tles and the Monkees. Those who
lived in the interwar period of
the first Czechoslovakian Repub-
lic remembered old freedom and
cautiously thought of the new
ones. They spoke of the Commun-
ist era as a dark age, and the
Nazi era as no age at all.

Jan Kozl, the middle-aged man-
ager of a state owned super mar-
ket did not hesitate to discuss
controversial men in Czech his-
tory. In fact, he specifically drew
attention to his right to say what-
ever he pleased. It was a newly
won freedom.

During the 12 year tenure of
the Stalinist Antonon Novotny

. Czechs spoke carefully with for-

eign visitors. Now, Kozl’s voice
raced excitedly as he noted the
changes enacted by the new
leadership in his country. All
newspapers could truly write
what they pleased. No holds were
being barred on criticism of the
Soviet neighbor.

served as the last foreign minis-
ter of his country before the So-
viet take-over of 1948.

However, there remained a
pessimistic tone in Mr. Kozl’s
conversation. Democracy, more
precisely a non-totalitarian form
of government, was a thing which
he had known. He recalled the
years before World War 11.
Though he was required to learn
the Russian language, he and his
friends wanted to learn English.
For one speaks Russian only in
the Soviet Union, while English
is rapidly becoming the Interna-
tional language. He wished that
news from the West would come
more quickly to Brno. He knew
of Sen. McCarthy and he wanted
to know how the students exer-
cised power in the United States.

To him, the future looked
bright. Dubcek had made pro-
mises and would try anything pos-
sible to fulfill them.

dreams of freedom are being
strangled by a Soviet straight

R Rabbi Rubenstein-I

‘Theologian’ — Not Atheist

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

« The Rabbi Richard L. Ruben-
"stein, the University Chaplain
of the Jewish Community, has
been accused of being an atheist.
“But according to the eminent
writer and lecturer this definition
of his philosophy is way off the
mark. In an. interview, he dis-
cussed the role of religion in the
modern world and his own place
asaleader.

_ “I basically consider myself a
theologian. ‘This is something
very new and different in the
Jewish Community.” he explain-
ﬂed. “Traditionally, the Rabbi has
been a teacher. The theologianis

‘interested in understanding hu-
‘ manexistence in terms of reli-
_ _vgion'.”.

serves as director of the B’nai. _ .-

"filled. with books, photographs

who “sported tortoise—shell sun-
glasses throughout the interview,
Dr._ ‘Rubenstein took an oppor-

A tunity to offer an evaluation of
* ~ g. religion.

g“Historically, religion has had

ly, religion is a way of sharing
crises and helping follow humans
to celebrate together.”

“The first function of religion
has disappeared. But the other
two are as alive as ever in the
modern world,” the Rabbi com-
mented.

As for atheism, Dr. Ruben-
stein believes that since the lat-
ter two functions of religion are
“indispensable”, atheists are a
permanent minority.

sophistification of normal people.” V  I.
Dr. Rubenstein is a Rabbi with- I I  ‘V

out a synagogue and he prefers
it that way. ‘

“I like to work in the Univer-
sity for a twofold reason.” he
said. “First, the University is the
place for the freest exchange of
ideas. It respects and encourages

_intellectual endeavor. Secondly,

one half of the United States is
under 28. The turned-on world is
the young world.”

The Rabbi also discussed “Es-
tablishment Judaism,” from which
he is estranged. Surprisingly,
Dr. Rubenstein considers those
of the establishment his
frients”. “My job is paid for by
them,” he jested. “I also have
an advantage with youth when I
am rejected by the -Establish-
ment.” -

Dr. Rubenstein has been invit-
ed to‘ speak on more than 50 col-
lege campuses this year. He is
now in the process of complet-
ing his third book. How has all
this notoriety affected him?

“I’m under more pressure to
make myself clear and to stand
criticism,” he said. “I’m also
more mobile; I spend part of
each year abroad. As well, I get
a chance to meet people and find
out what’s.going on.”

closed several changes and inno-
vations in the Greek system to

include new fraternities on cam-

Greene also said that two com-
mittees have been strengthened.

more coherent system for hear-

Anyway, this is part of our living room-
the bedroom and dinette look just as sharp.
How can a couple of college guys like us
afford all this loaded luxury stuff, you ask?
Nope—we’re no Rockefeller kith or kin—just
typical students, nursing our ﬁnances along.

When we first rented this place we
figured to scrounge some furniture from the
folks, maybe get a piece or two from a second-
hand store and ﬁll in with a couple of orange
crates.

Then we read in the newspapers that
Sheffield rents furniture!

Know what we found out in a hurry?
We found we could rent three whole rooms

of beautiful furniture with no strain! My

bucldy, Jeff, and I split the tab—$l2.50 apiece
a month, to be e..\'act—and we have -.1 place to
bug our friend.’s eyes outl '

Sure . . . you can do it, too . . . whether
you're students, or anybody! Just check in
with Sheffield Furniture Rental at 1200 Cha-
teau St. and pick out the furniture you like.
It’ll come to maybe $25 to $30 a month in all!
Live in the lap of luxury like we do without it
knocking the old wallet for a loop!

P. S. If you want, they can also rent you a TV . . . a
rug . . . a portable bar with stools . . . extra lamps, chairs,
pictures, paintings . .- . almost anything you need!

Do you make these ﬁve common mistakespf

1

about selecting diamonds?

TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE. IF YOU ANSWER ALL FIVE QUESTIONS RIGHT, YOU’RE AN EXPERT.

1. The ﬁnest diamonds are_ ,_ __ .
A. White B. Slightly yellow C. Blue-white
D. Colorless

2. When a diamond’s clarity is not marred by any scratch,
spot, cloud or other blemish, the gem can properly be
described as____.

_ A. "Ideal” B. "Perfect” C. “Flawless”

3. When professionals refer to a diamond’s "cut” they mean

A. Its general shape, such as round, oval, pear, marquise
or emerald.

B. The extent to which the angles and proportions of its
many sides, or facets, conform’ to the ideal for its par-
ticular shape.

C. The diamond’s ability to scratch other hard surfaces,
such as glass or steel. '

4. The value of a diamond is determined by its ,. 
A. Carat weight B. Cut C. Color
E. Price

D. Clarity

5. Aside from differences in the price ranges of various prod-
ucts, selecting a diamond is most like choosing._.___,__ _._ .
A. a watch B. Savings bonds C. a steak D. a new car

Here’s bow to score your answers. (But
please, don’t read any furt/oer until

you’ve answered all tbe questions to /////I-:-_—_;

.,""ll// _
;t/ae best of your ability.) 1"” '/ T‘ 

   
     
  
  
    

\ \

1. If you checked answer "D,” you’re abso- 9%?
lutely right. The ﬁnest diamonds have no /
color of their own whatever. They merely blaze I
with all the colors of the light that enters them.

If you checked "Blue-white,” be careful. The term
is fraught with ‘many meanings and loopholes. It is
used as a sales aid by some jewelers to help sell diamonds
of inferior color. Because "blue-white” is inexact and mis-
leading, we forbid the use of this term in referring to any
diamond at Hardy & Hayes.

\
\

2. If you checked “flawless,” you’re right again. A ﬂawless dia-
mond is not necessarily a “perfect” one, however. The Federal

// ,
////////////////

(l

V

   

Trade Commission’s ruling on the use of this term states that

besides being ﬂawless a diamond must not be of inferior color or
make. There really is no such thing as a “perfect” diamond.

Like the term “blue-white,” the term “perfect” is forbidden
at Hardy & Hayes.- ' '

3.«You are right if you chose answer "B.” Diamonds are cut in
different styles, such as round, oval, etc. There are Ideal angles
and proportions for -each style. ‘
When a professional refers to cut, he is talking about the
human factor of a diamond’s beauty. Just how well has man done

‘ his job? If the cutter deviates from the precise angles and propor-

tions of the Ideal, your diamond would have less beauty and
should therefore cost you less than a more precise cut.

4. If you chose any one of the four Cs, you’re partly right. A
diamond’s value is determined by all four. ‘

The price you pay for a diamond includes more than the value
of the gem itself; the value of the ring or other setting, for in-
stance. A portion of the seller’s cost of doing business also is in-
cluded, as is his profit.

Because all Hardy & Hayes diamonds are obtained directly,
via New York cutters, from the London sights of the Central
Selling Organization (marketing arm for all jewelry diamonds
in the world) our price does not include the proﬁts and expenses
of intermediate brokers, wholesalers or agents. For this reason,
you often pay less at Hardy & Hayes than you would elsewhere
for a diamond of comparable quality.

Judge foriyourself. We’ll give you a booklet* that explains
how the various characteristics of a diamond are rated and
how the professionals compare one diamond with another. It’s a

 

/

  

clearly written little booklet, easy to un-

may have _and, if you have time, show you
examples of the characteristics you’ll want to
. watch for. -

, Then shop around.
5. Buying a diamond has something in common with all
four possible answers, of course. Watches and automobiles,
being manmade, can be standardized, however. You can usually
expect one new car to perform as well and ride as comfortably as
another of the same make, model and_ equipment. But nature
never does-anything quite the same way twice._

Savings bonds have but one variable—their size, or dollar
value. You look at the denomination and you know what each
one’s worth. Not so a diamond. t

Selecting one is thus most like choosing a steak. No two are
quite alike. Price per pound (or carat) is only one of several
considerations. Color and clarity are as important in a diamond
as tenderness and ﬂavor in a steak. And cut, certainly, is vital to
both. , >-

Of course, one way to be sure of getting a good steak is to go to
a good butcher. We’ll spare you the rest of this analogy. '

If you got four of tbe ﬁve questions rig/at‘, your knowledge of
diamonds is above average. But even if you missedonly one, it
would be wise to ﬁnd out all you can about diamonds before
you actually invest in one. We’ll be delighted to belp you learn
as mucb as you care to. Don’t feel you'd be imposing. After all,
tbe more you /enow about diamonds, tbe better for us.

booklet the day we get your card.

Pallow, Discusses Po1iceman’s Role A

by DON MARBURY

“This is one of the misconcep-
tions that most University stu-
dents have about the campus po-
liceman,” said patrolman Wil-
liam Pallow. “They feel, he went
on, that we are here merely to
police them, and to enforce the
regulations of the University, but
this is not our fundamental pur-
pose at all.” Patrolman Pallow
said that the policeman’s main
function on campus is to actually

m 

protect the student and his prop-
erty.

Patrolman Pallow mention-
ed that he very rarely has had
trouble from University students.
“From what I’ve seen of Pitt stu-
dents, they are a very well be-
haved, well mannered group of
young men and women. They’ve
never given me any lip or any
trouble at all,” he went on to
say.

Pallo finds his profession very
interesting, and admits that it is
a great job for a girl watcher. “I
guess that’s why they only put
old marriedimen down here,” he
quipped. He remarked that
through his job, he has met many
interesting people and has made
lasting friends.

Pallow has not from his obser-
vations noticed too much racial
prejudice on campus. “It’s a sad

fact,” he commented, “but where ,

ever you go you are going to run
into racial prejudice. I’ve no-
ticed that most of the various eth-
nic groups keep to themselves,
but as for out and out racism I
don't see any more here at the
University than anywhere else.”

“I have never had to use my
gun,” Pallow said. “Actually,” he
continued, “the express purpose

 
 

T T T T
\:" 'u.. .2‘--.

L
T

of the gun is not its usage. It is
really just a reminder to anyone
that might have any ideas that
we do have a means to suppress
them.”

Pallow pointed out that in the
April riots, the campus police
were alertedto the possibility of
trouble, but that none of the po-
licemen actually anticipated hav-

ing to use their guns.

Pallow was not disturbed over
the recent accusation th a t th e

campus policemen were rejects ,

from the city policemen. “I’m not
saying that we are or we aren’t
better than the city policemen,
but most of the campus police-
men are men who have passed
the maximum age for city police-
men which I believe is 34. So
what you mainly have in a cam-
pus policemen is a very adequate,
just, mature man.” ~

The first meeting of the En-
gineering Cabinet will beheld
Sept. 17 at noon at 506 Engi-
neering Hall. The meeting is
open to interested students who
are not elected representatives. '

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Our draft system must be re-
vamped.

This is the opinion of New York
lawyers Henry Mark Holzer and
Phyllis Holzer, and Sen. Mark
Hatfield (D. Ore.) These people
filed separate reports criticizing
theconscription laws. The Hol-
zers’ call the laws unconstitu-
tional and contradictory to the
idea of government by the peo-
ple. Hatfield feels that the pre-
sent system is out moded and im-
practical, asserting that a volun-
teer army is more feasible.

“The -power of Congress to con-
script manpower for military
service is beyond question,” sta-
ted Chief Justice Earl Warren
May 27, when the Supreme Court
upheld the prosecution of draft
card burners.

The Holzers’ report,_ written in
the October and November 1967
issues of philosopher Ayn Rand’s
The Objectivist, questions the un-
questionable. Government, they
maintain, does not have the right
to initiate force against any of its
citizens. The government, there-
fore, cannot determine what a
young man will do with two or
four years of his life.

“When the Constitution was
drawn up, the power of Congress
to conscript was neither denied
nor granted,” stated the Holzers.
“Congress was expressly given
the power ‘To declare.war . . .
To raise and support armies . . .
To provide and maintain a navy.”’

Constitutionality
Tested

But the issue of Constitutional-
ity was not tested until Woodrow
Wilson signed the first conscrip-
tion law May 18, 1917, to provide
manpower for the first World War.
Ten men, indicted for failing to
register for the draft, in challen-
ing its Constitutionality before

the Supreme Court, raised every
Constitutional objection — except
what the Holzers call “the funda-
mental one.”

One major argument was that
Congress lacked the power to es-

V tablish a law that forces men to

fight. The highest court felt that
the right to conscript was guaran-
teed in Article 1. Section 8; “As
the mind cannot conceive an army
without men to compose it. on the
face of the Constitution the ob-
jection that it does not give pow-
er to provide for such men would
seem too frivolous for further
notice,” The Court discounted the
alternative of an army composed
of volunteer enlistments.

“This,” reasoned the Court,”

. challenges the existence

of all power, for a governmental

power which has no sanction to it

and which therefore can only be

exercised provided the citizens

consent to its exertion is in no
substantial sense a power.”

The Court, according to the
New York attorneys, was really
saying that if it cannot use force,
it has no power at all. Article 1,
section 8; also give Congress the
power to provide post offices and
post roads. -Men to fill the post
office functions were hired to
work for a monetary incentive.
“lt apparently never occurred to
the Supreme Court that an army
could be raised by the same me-
thod,” wrote the Holzers.

The separation of church and
state amendment of the Constitu-
tion formed the basis of another
argument. The religious exemp-
tion clause of the Selective Ser-
vice Act was attacked as conflict-
ing with this amendment. “Once
again,” found the Holzers, “the
Court skirted the-issue: ‘We pass
without anything. but statement
. . . . because we think its (the
argument’s) unsoundness is too ap-
parant to require us to do more.”’

Thirteenth Applied

The Thirteenth Amendment,
which bars slavery and involun-
tary servitude, was employed for
a further challenge. This con-
tention is “refuted by its mere
statement,” evaded the highest
court once again. This conflict-
ed with a 1911 Supreme Court
decision (Bailey vs. Alabama):
“The Thirteenth Amendment . . .
was a charter of universal freedom
for all persons, . . . The plain in-
tention was to abolish slavery of
whatever name and form . . . to
render impossible any state of bon-
dage.” Nevertheless. the Court
held that induction was not in-
voluntary servitude if some im-
portant duty to the state was invol- '
ved. “What duty?” and “to
whom?” asked the lawyers from
New York.

The Court’s political philosophy.
they said, showed that “freedom
and the draft were mutually ex-
clusive. “This endorsement of
statism as an element of American
Constitutional law . . . . was the
work of nine men who were un-
willing to meet, and unable to
discredit, valid legal arguments.”

To strengthen their argument,
the Justices of the Supreme Court
cited that 33 nations, as of 1918,
had used a conscription system to
people their armies. “Could our
Supreme Court really have be-
lieved that American citizens
were no more immune from gov-
ernmental force than were the help-
less peasants under the whip of
Japanese feudal barons?" asked
the lawyers Holzer.

The “fundamental” Constitu-
tional objection that was not used
is the most important argument.
according to the attorneys. This
is the Ninth Amendment which “re-
presents the most effective Consti-
tutional defense against conscri-
ption.”

The Ninth Amendment simply
states that, “The enumeration in
the Constitution of certain rights
shall not be constured to deny or
disparage others retained by the
people.” -

- Draft Rapped fromTwo Viewpoints

Amendment
Guaranteed Rights

This little used amendment was
originally intended to guarantee
to our citizens all of the rights
that were not specifically mention-
ed in the Bill of Rights or Con-
stitution.

“Our precious rights which this
law sought to protect and preserve
were slipping away,” wrote the
Holzers, “. . . . rights were being
transformed into privileges.”

People acted only by permis-
sion of the government. in ignor-
ing this vital amendment, and
could count only on the enumera-

’ ted rights of the Bill of Rights

and Constitution.

In defense of the present draft
system, Gen. Lewis Hershey, dir-
ector of Selective Service, feels
that conscription is the only me-
thod of meeting military manpow-
er needs.

“A voluntary military recruit-
ment program is not only econom-
ically feasible and capable of pro-
ducing” the necessary number of
recruits.” contradicted Sen. Hat-
field in introducing the Armed
Forces Improvements Act on
March 14, 1967, “it can also pro-
vide the quality of military per-
sonnel that is vital to the sophis-
ticated and technical nature of the
armed services.”

In this report. the Junior Senator
from Oregon tried to present the
system of military manpower re-
cruitment that best meets today’s
realities and needs. He-based his
opinions on the following criteria:
“First. preserve the maximum a-
mount of individual liberty and
freedom from unjustified intru-
sion by the government; Second,
be fair in its application so that
every young man receives equal
treatment and no young man is re-
quired to make sacrifices that are
not demanded of his peers; and
Third, the system must provide
for maximum national security and
must economically provide the
armed services with the needed
quantity and quality of men.”

“The current draftvsy.stem,”j;;
Hatfield stated, “does not ade-I

“Anytime a man is forced, a-
gainst his wishes, into»military.
service, his individual liberty and

Sen. Hatfield feels that the sur-‘~
render of one’s liberty can pos-
sible be justified “when their is no r
other alternative to conscription
and when it is absolutely neces—* *
sary for national survival.”

ment. He pointed out inequities -.

titude in interpreting and adminis- I ,
tering draft regulations. This lack
of clear and nationally uniform~ --_'
standards has led to situations ’
where cases with similar circum-
stances have been handled en tire- '- .
ly differently in various parts of
the country.” i

The most fundamental inequity ‘
of the present draft laws, accord-
ing to Hatfield, is that a smal-
ler and smaller minority of young " .
men carry the burden of national ‘
defense. The principle of sharing ~
the national defense responsibility
is now a “transparent falsehood.” ,
Only 46 per cent of men reach- "
ing age 26 have military expers : .
ience. Under present crisis con-
ditions, only about 300,000 men
are drafted annually our of a draft— ~
eligible pool that totals nearly
twelve and one half million.

“We cannot tolerate the injus-
tice of a system that capricious-
ly requisitions two years out of the.
lives of some young men while al-
lowing others their liberty,” Hat-
field concluded.

The present draft law fails the - 
third criterion. too, that of provid-
ing the necessary quantity and
quality of men needed for max-
imum efficiency. The current sys-
tem, the Senator concedes, has
the correct number of servicemen,
but they are extremely lacking in
quality. This is due to the high,
turnover rate of the draftees —
those who have been taken from
civilian life against their wishes
— which is 95 per cent. .

The cost of training a foot sol?-
dier is $6,000. This money is ex-.

Pancho, Cisco and Diablo:
Or Happy Hidden Valley Story

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

The sign said “Happy Hidden Valley Condo-
miniums"; but that was all wrong. Things weren’t-
happy, there was no hidden valley, and the people
would die before they could pay off their apart-
ments; But I was glad that there was a place like
that, so the old people would have somewhere to
go while they waited for death. I passed “The
Valley” everyday on my way to work and some-

how, the thought of two thousand men and women _

living together in a constant death watch made me
feel happier. I very rarely saw anyone; no one in
fact, ex“.-cept Pancho, Cisco, and Diablo.

There wasn’t anyone named that of course, but
on my way to work everday, I would see three
men walking along the side of the road together.
They were old, gray, and feeble, and they had
“ready to go” stamped all over them; but they
were the only ones brave enough to leave the
guarded walls of that incognito cemetery. Every-
day they were there, and everyday as I drove by I
whispered hello to Pancho, Cisco, and Diablo. Di-
ablo always walked in the middle, with Pancho on
the left and Cisco on the right. And every morning
they waved a guarded type wavefas if they were
saying hello for that instant. ,

‘While I was in my office I thought of them con-
stantly. I wondered what they did when they

. were’t walking in the morning. I wondered if they

lay in their beds all day so they would have enough
strength to take their evening walk as I drove
home from the office. I would have given anything
to go inside the walls of that place, but I wasn't
allowed. You had to be old and empty, and I was
young and full, I prospered and took everyone I
couldffor everything they had. And Pancho, Cisco,
and Diablo were always there in the morning and
evening to remind me how wonderful my life was.

But one morning I was on my way to work and
something went wrong. I mean something was

wrong. There was something missing, someone
missing; it was Pancho. Cisco and Diablo were
taking their walk, but no Pancho. They looked sad-
der than usual, and I knew Pancho had gone, dead,
fini. I whispered hello to the two remaining little
Indian boys, but they didn’t wave back. They
walked slower, knew death was nearer; and I felt
better.

At the office I tried to think where I had seen
that same type of scene before, and after I had
foreclosed a mortgage, I remembered. I thought of
a movie where John Garfield was going to the gas
chamber with a priest at his side. That’s what Cis-
co and Diablo were like. I thought that it would be
a kind gesture to send a priest over to “The Val-
ley,” but I’m certain that they were all religious
over there; peopleare like that near the end. I
could almost hear them pleading with God,

“Oh Lord save me,” or,

“Oh Lord welcome me into the kingdom of
heaven,” or,

“Oh Lord have mercy on my soul.”

It was pathetic, and I’m glad I could only al-
most hear it, because if I was there I would either
laugh, vomit, or both.

I’ll tell you this date so that you’ll have some-
thing to remember: March 32. Keep it in mind. I
woke up that morning to go to the office and it was
cold, cold as hell I thought. I put on my black
suit, —didn’t kiss the wife goodbye because I had

never gotten the urge to have someone sponge off.

me in the name of love, and drove to work. The
wind was howling, and down th_e road I looked
for my two dying friends. But now there was only
one, Diablo. He walked slowly, almost not moving
at all. His head slumped on his chest and he was
not watching anything. I knew that Cisco was
gone. I thought of the deals I would have to make
today, and slowed the car down. When he heard
the sound of my engine he slowly lifted his head
and began to wave. But it was a wave that ordered
me to stop. He walked over to the car with a smile

Columnists: Telling It Like It Is

“Helpful

- For Frosh” 

You freshmen have probably
been bombarded with tons of sug-
gestions as to what you should
do here at the University. I have
compiled a list of helpful hints
which are designed to ease your
problems here at the University.
The freshman who puts these
hints to work don’t have a worry
— he'll probably ﬂunk out of
school. Well, here they are.

1) Books. It is always helpful to
have books, especially when
they are required for your
courses. I suggest you buy
them now, because the big
rush for books starts during
the last. week of classes. If
you get your books now, you’ll
have the last week of school
to read them.
Stock up on ‘sleep no-w — in
fact, if you have time, sleep
a week or two now so you’ll
have some saved up for finals.
3) Favorite campus drinks; good
to know for all social occa-
sions. Try some milk of mag-
nesia and vodka-—it’s called a
Phillips Screwdriver and is
guaranteed to keep ‘you going
at both ends. Also, become

acquainted with the Nip and
Tuck (seven parts gin, ten
parts bourbon, nine parts of
lighter fluid). One nip of it
and they tuck you away.

4) Get a roadmap for Hillman
Library.

5) Bimbo’s Bar is not a Univers-' -

ity classroom.

6) Purchase a respirator for the I I

mountain climbing tours to

Pitt Stadium or if you’re plan-, I

ning to climb Mt. Mercy.

7) If you smoke Marlboro or in 
Winston, change brands—the‘. ;

machines are out of them.

8) Contrary to popular belief, , 
there ‘are no trees in ‘Trees 

Pool. (I chopped them down

last week.) . 
9) Yes, Virginia, there is a Wes 

ley W. Posvar.

By following any or none of

these suggestions, you will prob-

ably find life at the University 
say,:v .'
splitting atoms with your bare 
hand. All seriousnes aside, it is '

a little more easy than,

tions. And remember; a man nev-

“You have your choice,” he

And he laughed while 1 ‘

expended every two years when
new soldiers replace those who
have fulfilled their obligations.
Therefore. the draft provides the
needed quantity only at a great

. expense.

Quantity Does
Not Mean
Quality

0/  ‘Unfortunately, this tremendous

expenditure cannot buy the neces-

' sary quality of military person-
' nel. Large numbers of men, Hat-

field asserted, are no longer re-
levant for today’s highly tech-
nical and sophisticated weapons.

A 1967 report to President Eisen- -

hower recognized this new char-

acter of the military:

 Reduced to its simplest terms,
the personnel problem appears

.' . to be a matter of quality as op-

posed to quantity‘. . . . It is
foolish for the Armed Forces
— to. obtain highly advanced.wea-
pons systems and not have men
of sufficient competence to un-
- derstand, operate, and main-

‘ 0 _ tain such equipment.

. . The solution here, of

course, is not to draft more men

"to stand and look helplessly at
~ the machinery. -

=Hatfield feels that a smaller,

V highly trained, professional force

would be of greater efficiency than
the present one. The high degree
of weapons sophistication de-

‘ _.mands a more specialized per-

sonnel. The draft does not satisfy
but frustrates this need.

The tremendous turnover of
draftees undermines our military
strength and weakens the national

security, according to the Sena-

- tor. '43 per cent of the Army at
‘ any one time has less than one year

of experience. “By.the time a unit
is sufficiently experienced and
"able to operate as a team, the
trained men leave, are replaced

by green trainees and the cycle
starts all over again.”

As a result of this tudy. Sen.
Hatfield proposed a volunteer
program to replace the present con-
scription laws. A voluntary re-
crutiment system best satisfies the
Senator’s criteria.

Voluntary Army
Meets Criteria

First, a volunteer system pro-
vides maximum individual liberty
and freedom of choice because no
one would be forced to serve a-
gainst his will. Secondly, the in-

justices and inequitieswould be _

eliminated. Those men defending
the country would do so willingly.
The final criterion of efficiency,
economy, and maximum national
security would also be met.

The reduced _cost of high turn-
over could be the greatest econom-
ic benefit of _a voluntary program.
Present turnover of draftees is
nearly 95 per cent, but for career
men only 15 per cent. If the 85
per cent re-enlistment rate of car-
eer minded people could be main-
tained, the savings in the cost of
training new inductees would be
staggering-.

Other economies would include:
a reduction in the size of the mili-
tary forces, a _reduction in the
number of men necessary to train,
a reduction in the number of in-
structors and training facilities
needed, and a substitution of civ-
ilians for military men in non-
combatant positions.

Represent Rhomas Curtis (Mo.)
has estimated that the Govern-
ment spends $18,000 to keep a
soldier for one year. Ir would
not only lower expenses but fur-
ther reduce the number of men
necessary to recruit. This propos-
al would also allow those volun-
teers who are rejected because
of slight physical handicaps or
educational deficiencies to serve
in some capacity. With proper

training, Hatfield ascertain: that
these men could become produc-
tive menbers of the armed ser-
vices.

In conclusion, the Oregonian
Senator stated that a volunteer
army would be more responsive
in an emergency than the pre-
sent army. 43 per cent of the For-
ces at any given time have less

than a year’s experience, accord- '

ing to Gen, Lynn Smith. Due
to the significantly lower turn-
over rate of present volunteers,
a wholly volunteer army would
be far more experienced and there
fore better qualified to meet a cris-
is situation than the present For-
ces.

To accept a voluntary military
manpower recruitment system,
“We must be willing to accept
the challenges of new realities
and have the foresight and confi-

    Movement   

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Student Government will fo-
cus its attention on -the student
power movement during the
coming academic term.

“We want everything that af-

pletely into student hands,” ack-
nowledged SG President, K en
Schueker.

SG ‘will concentrate on three

student rights, educational inno-

dent’s role in society.

Schueler feels that University’

students have been disenfran-
chised. He -advocates active stu-

ceiling. Though Brother-hood is
billed as a male boutique, it is

not like any other. men's store

The shop is owned. built, and

West Coast Sounds Evolve

by JOE ANDERSON

For the past three years the
West Coast subculture has been
responsible for some of the most
exciting developments in Rock
music. Never before has one spe-
cific area been so fructuous. And
yet what is even more amazing
is that each group to come out
of this area has maintained an
independence of sound, a dis-
tinct style all their own in spite
of the fact that they share a com-
mon origin. Because of the di-
versity of the West Coast audi-
ence, a demand for musical ecle-
'ticism has arisen which insures
a high degree of dissimilarity a-
mong groups. It is this element
that makes the West Coast sound
so challenging both to the artist
and the audience. This summer’s
harvest of the California rock field
further substantiated the claim

that the West is the best.

Probably the most imaginative
group to come out of the West
Coast rock revival is Country Joe
and the Fish. Released this sum-
mer was their third album enti-
tled Together. Two of the songs on
this album (The Streets of Your
Town and The Harlem Song) are
aimed at the horrors of New York
City and everything it stands for.
. The hate and the despair. The pov-
erty in the face of affluence. The
biting satire of The Harlem Song’s
travel brochure is hard to forget.
The most important song on this

album though is Joe McDonald’s
An Untitled Protest. Although the
theme is the old horrors of war
cliche, the imagery and descri-
ptions make it a very ‘impressive
piece.

The two most commercially suc-
cessful groups from the West
Coast, the Jefferson Airplane and
the Doors, both had new releases
this summer. TheAirplane’s
Crown of Creation is really a

_ masterpiece, especially after their

last fiasco, After Bathing at Bax-
ters. Some of the groups bestworks
can be found on this album. Grace
Slick is in complete command of
all her marvelous resources when
she relates the sad tale of ‘poor
Lather who “was thirty years old
today” and “they took away all his
toys.” Poor Lather, is left alone
to wonder if he’s still young. A
really fine piece of what might
be called “experimental” music
is accomplished by Spencer Dry-
den in Chushingura. The lead vo-
cal of Marty Balin is simply
superb on such songs as In Time
and If You Feel. It’s his voice
that was missed most on the Bax-
ter album. The House at Pooneli
Corners is probably the song on
this album which the Jefferson
Airplane consider to be the most
significant. And yet because of a
certain childish fixation with feed-
back and noise, the song 10393
most of its effect.

\

The sound of the Doors in a
paradox of style. Their lyrics have
a strange fascination with primi-
tive naturalism, almost to the point
of being paganistic and yet their
musical accompaniment is so in-
tellectual and elaborate. This is
especially evident on Waiting for
the Sun where songs like Not to
Touch the Earth and Yes, the Riv-
er Knows are perfect examples.
This is not to say that this parti-
cular style is bad. To be sure it
is the secret of the Doors’ success
but nonetheless I find songs like
My Wild Love and those of the
Doors’ first album much more
appealing.

It’s been a long time between
the first Big Brother and the Hold-
ing Company album and this their
second album, Cheap Thrills.

During the time lapse between
the two their popularity has never
wane. The secret of their magic is
of course the vocal of sweet
Janis Joplin, the best female white
blues singer in America. Of no
less importance is-the group itself
which from all appearance and
sound have been playing the
blues since birth. The best cuts
for Janis, are Summer Time and
Piece of My Heart. The only way
to judge an album of this nature
is by its sensuous appeal. Just
listen to the opening rift on I
Need a Man to Love. If it makes
you feel good then you know you-
’ve got it.

Anthem of the Sun is the second
album by the Grateful Dead and
in comparsion to the first it is
rather dissappointing, though giv-
en a certain amount of time and
patience the album does improve.
The question is whether or not the
listener should be expected to de-
vote that much time. The struc-
ture is basically that of experi-
mental music with a- few moments
of sanity interspersed. If you can
take unpatterned time changes,
atonality and a lot of improviza-

. tion then Anthem of the Sun is

your thing.

on Vietnam have been published this year. Yet he speaks witl£* 

freshness and authority.

He is a professor at Columbia University teaching the first

the affairs of Vietnam since his first meeting with Ho Chi Minh

in 1946.

Mr. Schoenbrun attacks the issue of Vietnam with well-docu-i

The captains of American in-
dustry claim to need young men
processed -to occupy another set
of cubicles as well, those of
the Pentagon and its many ex-
tensions around the world.
Whether this need arises only
because ‘of the “extravagance”
of constructing more cubicles
at home is not clear; in any
case -the University has taken on
this other production job with
equal zeal. Its processing of ca-
reer military officers is an ex-
ample of behavioral processing-
which must evoke admiration in
any psychologist.

ROTC is a larger source of
career officers than the military
academies and officers’ candi-
date schools combined. However.
the entering, student is not in-
formed of this objective of the
program. He is given‘ the im-
pression that he is only being
trained to be a reservist subject
to two years’ active duty. and

drafted and have to serve as-
a private. (This, is also untrue.
There are a number of draft
classifications besides 1-A.)

fully baited hook, the green ca-

det is then exposed by the Uni-

versity to the hazards of a grad-_

Dr. David Houston, is Asso-

at -the University. He‘ earned
his degree from the University
of California at Berkley.

Welcome to the University.
You have just entered or re-
turned to America’s greatest
brainwashing, consciousness con-

The forms of this process in-

-the beginning of the junior year

he is asked to sign a one-way ‘

contract, -to commit himself to
accepting any’ reserve commis-
sion offered to him despite the
fact that the military makes
no guarantee to offer such a
commission. As an added induce-
ment the cadet is even paid to
take ROTC after signing this
“bargain.”

‘During the remaining two
years he might find time to eval-
LIate society off campus or con-
sider what a “purposeful life”
might be, and he might have
qualms about serving in the mili-
tary. But it's too late, The Uni-
versi-ty and the military have
conspired against him and now
deliver him to the Army, another
package processed by the Uni-
versity. ~

dress, speak, and think so as
to take your place comfortably
in a society only slightly more
rigid, with lives only a little
bit ’emptier‘, and houses only
somewhat more filled with junk
than those of your parents.

Those of you who are “good
students” will learn he mean-

“meaningful dialogue,” “concen-

will acquire all the paraphern-

You will learn how to say

is the greatest finishing school
in history, and -most of you in
all too short a time will be

  Improvement

Expected
In All Areas

by Art Rosenganten

This is “the year the Pan-
ther begins to growl.” It has
been five long years since
‘the Pitt fans have seen a winner
and this year's squad may just
be able to give them one.

“We’re better.” said third year
head coach Dave Hart comparing
this squad to his last two, which
\\'on a total of two games while

 
 

 

   
     
   

  

"l’ou'r<' 200 per (‘cut iIIl])l'()l‘(’([ Iliis _l/(’(lI'. bu! you .s'I(IrI('(I 1000 per

“This is the season the Panther should turn the corner and
break downfield to greener pastures. This is the season that has
already_been two years in the making. But even Dave Hart is
the first to agree with the above-quoted Pitt fan.

“There is a lot more pressure on us to win,” he remarked
the other day, “but, then, our chances of winning are greater

  

ing any predictions, but I’ll be
certainly disappointed if we're
not 5 and 5."

“We're certainly much better
than last years squad, but so
;what‘.”', he continued. “To say
 that we are better is a fact, but
§so'are our opponents and they
i are the ones that we must prove
 it to.”

The big question surrounding
 the-varsity squad is whether the
iso-called “Super Sophs” will be
 able to overcome their total in-
 experience and jell with the vet-
 erans into one cohesive unit. “I’m
gextremely pleased with the
§squad’s execution of plays, but
imost of these men have .never
 been tested under playing condi-
§ tions. This is where we will see
 how really good they are,” stated
 Hart.

Going along with the guarded
; optimism of coach Hart is that of
Ehead offensive coach Howard
 Weyers and head defensive coach
 Dan Sekanovich. Weyers has been
 with the team since the Fall of
1967, while this is Sekanovichs

   
        
       
   
  
   
  
    
  
    
   
    
  
     
   
  
    
  
 
  
 
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
    
    
  
     
    

  

  

“It’s like this. If you have a chance at a jackpot, but it’s
a one in’ ten chance, you figure, oh well, I don’t have much of
a chance. But when they eliminate eight and it’s you or the
other guy, then you’re in a contest.”

Most assuredly, the Panthers are in ten contests this season.
While they may not match every team in personnel, experience,"
etc., they are capable of matching anyof the ten in any given
contest. ‘

“Let’s not try and come out of these games with just rex-
pectability or satisfaction with the job we’ve done.” argued
Hart. “Let’s come out with points on the scoreboard in our fa-

The last two and a half years have brought great changes
to the football picture here. Pitt was in a losing syndrome
through the mid—60’s and it wasn’t until the change in the foot-
ball program in fall 1965 that the other sports began to rebuild

Dave Hart vanguarded a new type of coach for the Univer-
sity. Now there’s also Dave Adams and Jim Banner. Go-getters.
Hare-nosed recruiters. But for all his hard work, Hart is not to-
tally satisfied with his progress to date. ‘

“I suppose that on a regular time table we’re about on par,”
he commented. “But my personal time schedule was to win that
first year. I w-anted the chance to win right away.

. “My contract’s for four years,” he continued, “but that’s
just for security. I wanted things done immediately, but I see

 

But Hart has wrought changes — hopefully winning
changes - in many areas of the program. More personnel, more
coaches, better facilities, and a better attitude. He spoke of the
change in motels for the squad on Friday nights before home
games as. if the fact that they now have a nice place to relax
outside on lounge chairs could push an extra six points across
against West Virginia. Maybe it can.

“The improvement in personnel is the most dramatic change
since I’ve been here,” Hart observed. “but no matter how good
they are, if they’re not right mentally about everything. when
they take the field they don’t produce.”

The point about mental attitude raises several key issues if
the upcoming season is to be a successful one. First. after the
big build—up given the sophomores. aren’t some of the upper-
classmen liable to be resentful?

“I*don’t think so,” said Hart. ‘_‘The kid who wants to win,
wants good football players around, just so they can be with
them. Eddie Gallin’s the best linebacker we have right now and
the hardest worker on the defense. People know he’s doing a
great job.

“And the junior class — our first group of recruits - has sort
of been lost, too. But a lot of them are playing for us still. Last
year was the first group we had a full year to recruit. And when
you get fellows like Cindrich. Weston. and Pilconis. you feel
proud and don’t mind sounding off about them."

But what happens to the big build—up if UCLA smashes
the Panthers decisively? Hart doesn’t think it can happen and
neither does this writer.

“This year I feel like the kids can do it - despite the fact
that UCLA.will be favored,” viewed Hart. “But I'm glad that
West Virginia’s next on the schedule because regardless of the
UCLA game we should get sky high for that one.”

"This is the year Hart should see some results from his hard

work‘. It's a long way back from 1000 per cent behind. and the
best IS yet to come. ‘

Phoio by Bob Donaldson-
SPLIT END Harry “Skip" Orszulak (80) works on his blocking with
an assist from Chuck Winters (14). Orszulak, a tri-captain, is the
front-runner at his position _while Winters only recently switched
from quarterback to wingback.

LINEBACKER COACH John Rosenberg works on
improving the reactions of one of his charges. Ros- _
enbergfs job is a lot more pleasant this season than
in the past because‘ of anuabundance of lineback-

first season with the Panthers.

Coach Weyer’s offense is made
up mostly of veterans, especially
up front on the forward wall. Ev-
en though his squad is mostly
experienced players, Weyers has
found something new among
them.

“This year all the kids really
believe in themselves, more than
they ever have,” he states proud-
ly. _ '

The offense will utilize a ver-
sion of what is called a pro-type
offense. “This type ‘of offense
makes use of two wide receivers
and it is designed to fit our type
of personnel,” explained Weyers.
“Our offensive strength lies in
our outside running and our pass-
ing game,” he continues.

The passing game isggoing to
be led by the surprise "of the
spring and fall camps, tiny soph-
omore quarterback Dave Havern.
Havern. who stands 5’8” and
weighs almost 155 pounds drip-
ping wet, is a roll-out type of
signal-caller. He can pass while
rolling in either direction and can
scramble if the situation calls for

-it. Havern also has improved his

throwing from the pocket and
his reading of defenses.

.When Havern hands off, he
will have a host of backs to

choose from. Fullbacks Jeff Brown
and Tony Esposito provide the‘

punch up the middle, while taili

backs Gary Cramer, Deimiy Fer-
ris andiDave Garnett have the
ability to turn the corner for
the long gains. Along, the air
route, Havern can choose from
tight end George Medich, wing-
backs Joe McCain and J. D. Lew-
is, and split end Skip Orszulak.

When the offense takes a rest,
Coach Sekanovich"s defense‘ will
take charge. Even though most

of them are without any playing 

experience, Sekanovich feels that
with their desire and aggressive-

ness, they can overcome. any of?‘

fensive threat.

“The boys reported ready‘ to 

play and they realize that mis-"
takes will occur, but that the
best way to prevent them is for

all eleven men to get to the ballgi

and hit hard and aggresively” he
said.

Sekanovich believes that in or-

der for a defense to be truly- '

5011nd. they must be able to do
certain things. “The boys must
be able to show both lateral and
vertical containment and be able
to cover the flats, when this is
done all of the 17 offensive zones.

(2ri:.:.I('(l V('!t'ran

When Dave Hart handed out
the first team blue jerseys to

the defense last week, senior tri-

captain Ed Gallin got the first
one. '

Gallin, a 5’l1”, 225 pound line-
backer from Buffalo, is a two-
year starter and letter winner for
the Panthers. At the beginning of
spring drills in April, however.
Gallin had his work cut out for
him. An outstanding crop of soph-
omore linebackers. including
three Pennsylvania Big 33 pros-
pects, wanted that blue jersey.

After a fine spring, Ed had not
only earned his starting spot once
again, but was elected by his team-
mates to captain the team. His
experience and leadership should
be a steadying influence on the
young defensive platoon.

Heralded as one of the hardest
tacklers on the team, Gallin was
a fullback at Riverside High
School in Buffalo. He was named
All-Buffalo for two years, All-
Western New York, and honorable
mention All-American.

ship to the offensive line.

Whittaker, a senior tackle from
Mineral.Ridge, Ohio, was a steady
performer for the defense last
year after lettering as an offen-
sive tackle in 1966 as a sopho-
more. This season he moves back
to offense where he should open
some big holes ‘for the Panther
backs.

Last week. however. the offense
received some bad news when
Easy’ went down with a knee in-
jury during a scrimmage. He'll
be out of action indefinitely with
torn ligaments and is possibly a
doubtful starter for the-opener at
UCLA. September 21.

The offensive line has been
cited by some observers as the
weak spot of the squad and the
loss of Whittaker for an extended
period of time will be a big one.
Junior Rod Fedorchak, a conver-
ted end, has moved up the tight
tackle spot.

Named to the all-Ohio team in
high school, Whittaker won four
letters in the grid sport and three
each in basketball and track. He
won honorable mention all-state
honors in basketball and set the
school discus record in track. He
should win a few more honors‘

SKIP ORSZULAK W
Prrmiising Seu.s-on .-llwad

Skip Orszulak was healthy
this spring. He won a starting
spot on the Panther offense and
was selected tri-captain by his
teammates, If Skip stays healthy
this fall, he should be a favorite
target for the aerials of_quarter-
backs Dave Havern., and Frank
Gustine.

Plagued by a variety of leg.
shoulder and finger injuries, Or-
zulak spent most of the past two
seasons watching the action from
the sidelines. failing to realize
the promise he displayed at West
Mifflin North where he was an
All—American and All-State half-
back.

As a sohpomore in 1966. Skip
caught 16 passes for 167 yards.
Last year he missed most of the
season and was on the receiving
end of two passes. .

This spring, the coaching staff
moved Skip from the backfield to
the split end spot. He was im-
pressive in spring drills and edged
out sophomore Bill Pilconis for
the starting job.

At 6.2“, Orszulak lacks the size
of the 6’6“ Pilconis, but he posses-
ses the speed, the moves and the
experience. As an ex-halfback. he
knows what to do once he gets

Kokor Will Coach Recruits
On Separate Practice Field

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Another freshman football team, clothed in blue and

gold, full of new faces, and headed by newly appointed
head-coach Karl Kokor, will have its own ﬁeld when it starts practice
today. It’s not exactly what you would expect a promised land to be
like, but it’s a good enough substitute.

In the past, the'-athletic program provided just one .practice field
for both the varsity and freshman football squads. Although provisions
for a new field have not yet been made, something has been done to
eliminate the cleated traffic jam on Trees Field. '

This year's talented recruits will make the best of either the
Little League field near Forbes Field or the utility ﬁeld behind
Veteran’s Hospital.

“Now the freshman will be able to develop as one uin-it,” ex-
plained Kokor optimistically. , '

“But of course, a separate field has its disadvantages also,” he
realized. “They might not mature as fast because they won't be
hitting as hard as when they play with the older boys.’’'

Overall however, the decision to have the frosh practice separate-
ly has to be beneficial to the University's football program.

I “This -year,” rationalized Kokor, “the freshmen don’t fit into the
varsity plans as they did last year.”

, And so this year, the new recruits will benefit from more indi-
vidual attention than past Cub players have had in the mass confusion
at Trees Field. ' '

A number of highly publicized players are involved. Pittsburgh
bred Bill Donovan (6-3,220, halfback), Jack Dykes (6-0, 216, center-
tackle), and Joe Carrol‘ (6-1, 200, end) are among. the highly touted

crop of high school players sought by numerous schools, andsnagged

by Coach Dave Hart.

Kokor plans to handle his personnel differently than last year's
frosh coach Darrell Lwis.’ As] Lewiss .is assistant last year, Kokor has
learned from the mistakes of last year’s program. i

“This year, each boy is going to learn how to play two positions,”
explained Kokor, “one defensive position and one offensive position.”

Kokor hopes to develop all around-football players, instead of

limiting them to the machine-like functions of one position. ‘He
realizes the fact that some of his players might be handling positions
inappropriate to their abilities. Watching his players at differen

, positions could prevent such mistakes. -

Kokor’s intended innovations will keep him and his staff busy
with more players than he ever expected to have. The fresh now
lists sixty able bodies due to an unexpected number of w_alk-ons.
Just how able the walk-on‘s are remains to be seen, and Kokor has
his doubts. ’

“Some of them may never show up, and only five or six are
above 200 pounds,’-’ rationalized Kokor, “but I’ll be more than happy
to have a squad’ of 40 players.”

Kokor will also be more than happy to develop his players into
a winning unit, and he has seven short weeks to do it in, in the

Freshman Footballers Start Practice Today   
Frosh Coach Welcomes i  
Surprise Opportunity  

Karl Kokor has found unexpected opportunity froinl“

the strange functions of an education system.  I  .
During the winter trimester, the University was in need of a..,.

his position to go to greener
pastures. Before long however,
Ned Mervos, an ex-football play-
er at Youngstown was hired.
The frosh gridders start prac-
tice today, but Mervos is not di-
recting the activities. During the
summer, Mervos accepted the
position of principal at West Milf-
lin North High Schoollwith the
stipulation that he was to engage
in no other outside activities.

Frosh Aides Announced

Karl Kokor is not alone
in sharing the responsibility
for the freshman football-
ers and the Cubs’ fall pro-
gram. Three assistant
coaches round out his staff.

Recently pack from service in
Vietnam is Andy Dzurinko. Andy,
who hails» from Monessen, Pa.,
_is currently teaching in the spe-
cial education program at West-
inghouse High School. He played
his college footbal at Bucknell
and will handle the freshman of-
fensive line as well as the defen-
sive tackles.

Fred Philips brings coaching

experience to his job as coach
of the offensive and defensive
backfields. A f t e r graduating
Bowling Green University, he
served as an assistant at Massilon
High in Ohio‘, a perennial high
school powerhouse and later as
an aide at Bowling Green.

In his second year at Pitt is
John Rosenberg, who formerly
played football and coached at
Harvard. Rosenberg also serves
as assistant director of ﬁnancial
aid at the University. He works
primarily with the linebackers,
but with the defense in general.
John also handles a good portion
o-f the scouting for Head Coach
Dave Hart.

-New Facilities

Griclclers Dress to Soul

“Is it the downtown Hil-
ton? No! It’s Pitt’s new
locker room,” shouted tac-
kle Art Alois as he entered the

  

 

 

 

newly renovated football quar-
ters in Pitt Stadium.

Gone is the old grey cement
ﬂoors and in its place is a navy
blue wall-towall carpetingi Blue
and gold lockers line the walls.
Stereo soul music is piped in. And
the piece-de-resistance stands
tucked away in the trainer’s
room, a sauna bath, big enough
for eight sweating hulks.

In one locker at the end of the
room hangs the new uniforms
that the Panthers will wear this
season. The home jersey is a
deep, deep’, almost black, navy
blue jersey with gold numer-
als. The football pants, made of
lightweight, top quality material,
are a gold, ala Notre Dame, and
the hemlets are an irredescent
gold.

The majority of these improve-
ments was paid for by the inter-
ested Pitt alumni and Panther
football fans. The University did
pay for the new uniforms and the
painting of the locker room.

All TAE additions and improve-
ments are part of a subtle plan
to create a new winning attitude
among the players. During the
summer there was also a new
tartan track laid in. the Field
House. A good attitude is the ﬁrst
step to a good team; and -while
many of the players might not
be —overtly enthusiastic over the
“new locker room, inside they
have to feel at least a little lift
out the dreariness of the past
two seasons.

 UCLA Sept. 21

 "A Opening their 50th year of football, Tommy Prothro’s
7 UCLA Bruins appear to have been hit hard by the gradua-
tion of 22 lettermen, ten of whom were starters. Most of the football
_ prognosticators have overlooked UCLA in the preseason Top Ten
-‘polls, but as Prothro says, “We at UCLA always expect to have a
A good football team—and this year is no exception.”

 Gone is The Great One, Heisman trophy winner Gary Beban, and
the7direction of the Bruin offense is being turned over to Beban’s
understudy, junior Bill Bolden. Bolden doesn’t seem to have a strong
passing arm and because of this, the Bruin offense will turn to the
ground ga-me, with Bolden frequently resorting to the quarterback
option. Joining Bolden is the backfield are lettermen Greg Jones,
-junior tailback, and seniorfullback Rick Purdy, the 1-2 rushers of
 last year’s nationally ranked team. ‘

:. When Bolden travels the air route, fleetfooted Hal Busby and Ron
» ‘Copeland will be the men to look out for long, while right halfback
";lGeorige Farmer is the short receiver. Anchoring the offensive line will
'”be*.iunior tackle Gordon Besserman, the lone returning starter. De-
fense will be centered around All-American candidate Mike “Cat"
Ballou, and tackle Larry Agajanian.

With an inexperienced offensive line and defensive secondary_to
.worry about, Prothro enters the season optimistic but reserved. He
looks for the winning spirit of the Bruins to carry him through an-
other extremely successful campaign; but on the other hand, he feels
. gthat graduation may have taken too great a toll to recoup in one

--William 6; Mary.

. Coach Marv LeV.y’s Indians will be hard pressed to
keep up the winning tradition that they have established
overthe last four seasons. This year's squad is missing many of the
--:»regulars that brought William and Mary three straight winning sea-
sons, and a tougher schedule doesn't help the situation.

" The offense has several good runners and two fine receivers. but

Continued improvement will mark this year’s Moun-
taineer squad. Coming off a 5-4-1 season and a Southern
Conference Championship, third-year coach Jim Carlin hopes to blend
the eagerness of a bumper crop of sophomores with the experience
and leadership of 23 returning lettermen into a winning combination
for WVU’s initial outing as a major football independent.‘

Defense is the backbone of WVU football, with the leadership
being supplied by senior linebacker Baker Brown, and middle-guard
Carl Crennel, the only sophomore selected to last year’s AP All-
American team. The defensive secondary will be manned mostly by
sophomores and may prove vulnerable to a strong passing attack.

The offensive signal calling will be split among quarterbacks Tom
Digon and Garland Hudson, who together completed 58 per cent of
their passes last year. Seven lettermen return to the offensive team,
but they will be hard-pressed by sophomores for their starting jobs.
The kicking is handled by possible All-American Ken Juskowich, who
last year kicked a record five field‘ goals against Pitt.

The success of Carlin’s Mountaineers rests heavily upon his sopho-
mores, and how far the team will go depends on the speed with which
these grecniplayers can become gridiron veterans.

Oct. 5  

 

-::the main problem lies in who will direct it. Four men have a good
shot at leading the Indians, but no one candidate has proved to be
‘-truly outstanding. Most of the ball carrying will be done by veterans
Jeff Lund and Terry Morton, while the ends will be All-SC Jim Cava-
naugh, who pulled in 48 passes last year and Ted Zychowski.

“ Defensively, the Indians must rely on their heavy crop of sopho-
vmores, which means that the defense should get stronger as the sea-
son progresses. Safety Jimmy Barton and Steve Howard will be the
* only experienced men in the defensive secondary. Most o-f the de-
 '_fense’s depth will be composed of sophomores, which will put an
added strain on the few lettermen around.

. William and Mary on ‘paper seems to be a decisive underdog,
S ‘but Coach Levy has a knack for getting his team up and the Indians
will pull a good number of surprises, as they did last year in upsetting
Navy and tying West Virginia.

at Navy Oct. 19

Optimism is the word at the Naval Academy. Bill
Elias, the Middies mentor, has a tremendous rebuilding
job ahead of him. Gone are the explosiveioffensivc duo of quarter-
back John Cartwright and split-end Rob Taylor and returning is most
of a defensive unit which surrended 205 points last fall.

The search for Cartwright‘s replacement has developed into a duel
between junior Bob Paccntu, a graduate of Navy’s junior varsity,
and Mike McNallen, the starting passer for last year’s Plebes. The
main target of these will be Captain Mike Clark, the top returning
senior. Rushing seems to be the offenses strong point, with a quartet
of proven ball carriers at Elias’ disposal.

Defense is one big void which Elias must fill. He has a group of
returnees to work with. but their performance must improve over
last year, if Navy is to win. If there is any defensive strength it is at
the tackles, where Tom Cleverdon and Tom McKeon are exceptionally
strong.

The upcoming season appears to be bleak for the Midshipmen
from Annapolis, but Coach Elias isn’t about to write the season off.

Air Force Oct. 25

The Falcons of Air Force begin a new chapter in Pitt
football history as they meet the Panthers for the first
time this season. Coach Ben Martin, the dean of the academy coaches
beginning his 13th season,-will bring a small but spirited crew to
Pitt Stadium. '

The main strength of the Falcons will be their offense. A majority
of -last year's tarters are returning and with the added experience
should be able to rev up an offense which only spurted last year.’

The brunt of the attack will rest upon the passing arms of veterans‘

Steve Turner and Gary Baxter and their mobility out of a flexible
T formation.

The _defensive platoon was decimated by graduation, except for
the tackles, where Ed Epping and Barry Cline lead the way. Most of
the other spots will have to be filled by players with little or no var-
sity experience, and could prove a tremendous handicap to any Fal-
con success. . ‘ _

Coach'Martin expects a tough season of rebuilding, but he feels
that his offense will be able to put quite a few points on the score-
board" to offset the mistakes of his inexperienced defense.

at Miami Nov. 1

Defense is the major asset of the Hurricanes of Coach’ ‘

Charlie Tate, ‘and the backbone of that defense is everybody’s
All-American, defensive end Ted Hendricks.

Hendricks, shooting for his third A11-American rating, will lead a

’ veteran defensive squad through a schedule that is one of the toughest

in the nation. Backing up Hendricks is record breading middle guard
Jerry Pierce, linebacker Bob Czipulis, and defensive backs Tony Sch-
wartz and Bob Abbott.

The offensive problems seen to remain the same as last year, the
lack of an effective passer and a strong offensive line. Handling the
reins once again will be David Olivio, but behind him there is very
little depth.

On the ground the Hurricanes look strong with runners such as
John Aeuff, Vince Opalsky and sophomor Bobby Best. Of course, the
will be only as good as the line that opens the holes for them. ’

at NotreDame

The Fighting Irish once again present a strong‘ obstacle

for any college squad to overcome. With size, speed, and ‘

numbers, they have everything it takes to be a pigskin powerhouse.

The only dent in the Irish armor is a defense that is going to
present some problems‘ to head coach Ara Parseghian. Gone is the
strong secondary of Tom Schoen, Tom O‘Leary and Jim Smithberger,

three of the starting four linebackers, and the All-American tackle

Kevin Hardy. The fate of the famed Irish defense
will rest with the sophomores, especially in that all
important secondary. Sophs Tony Capers, a tackle,
and defensive right halfback Ernie Jackson are 7
highly touted by Parseghian. f V

Whatever the defense lacks in greatness, the 
powerful offense should more than overcome. The

at Syracuse

For the first time since Coach Ben
Schwartzwalder and Syracuse football got
together, the Orangemen will ‘be witho-ut the ser-
‘vices of an explosive runner, such as Jim Bro-wn,
Ernie Davis, Floyd Little or Larry Cso-nka.

To offset the absence of a strong running game,
the Orangemen have turned all their efforts towards
defense. Last year, Syracuse ranked second in the
nation against rushing and fourth in overall defense.

All-American candidates Tony Kyasky, a deft
defensive halfback, and Art Tho-mas, a bruising
tackle head up the veteran defense. The front four
of Lou Gubitosa and Steve Zagalia at the ends,
Thomas, and middle guard Gerry Beach all played
together last fall, and once again seem to spell trou-
ble for opponent runners and quarterbacks.

“Our most serious problems are depth and

quarterbacking,” says. Schwartzwalder, as he pre-

men. Syracuse lost its top three rushers, its top
passer and its top four receivers due to graduation.
A good deal of question marks remain as to who
will fill these spots.

The quarterback slot has been given to Paul
Paolisso, a junior who had :1 total of ony four of-
fensive plays last year. Behind him is Ron. Trask,

a, boy who had never played the position until,

spring practice. The magic number 44, worn by
past Orange heroes, will be worn by Rich Pan-
czyszyn. who was injured in last season’s first
game and remains a question mark for this one.
The offensive line is young and inexperienced, nei-
ther of which will help the quarterback situation.
Schwartzwalder talks this season of respectabil-
ity rather than overpowering success. With a deci-
sive lack of depth, any key injuries will play a

big ipart-in det.ermining whether .or not Syracuse.

The offensive line has only two returning letter- 

men to bolster it. One of these is tight end Gary

_, Steele. one of the better blocking ends in the East.
Tackle Bill Ivany provides the other experience
up front. Linebacking seems to‘ be the Cadets
strongest'point with All-American candidate and
captain Ken Johnson leading the way. Tom Whee-
lock has been given the General assignment and
will team with Johnson at one of the other line-
backing slots.

It doesn’t seem that there will be many sopho-
mores able to break into the Black Knights’ start-
ing lineup. This might prove costly, if injuries be- I

On paper, it appears that the Cadets "will be the

Bemis Toughens Workouts,  

Looks for Improved Bwooters

by ED

Vince Bartolotta has just returned from six ‘Weeks
,Marine training and his presence should be felt on the
varsity soccer practice field. The former Pitt soccer star and second-
year law student is assisting Coach Leo Bemis in a physical condi-
tioning program that is intended to bring about a reversal of last

fall’s poor performance.

The squad wound up last season with a 2 win, 7 loss, 2 tie record

and Bemis still can relive each
loss in what was his first losing
season in quite a while.

“We were a pretty good ball
-handling team, but there were
no blooded scorers,” the coach
mentions.

There were practically no
scorers last season. Dave Shim-
peno led with four points. The
team tallied only eight points
throughout its eleven-game sea-
son.

Bemis will have to fin-d the
scoring punch somewhere else
this fall. After a practice ses-
sion Shimpeno has ,de'oidedi.to
call it quits. ’

‘‘He’s just pl.ayed a-ll'he wants
to,” Bem.is relates. “He gave us
three fine years.’-’

As for the new conditioning
program, it is tough. The coach
states this as the reason he will
be fielding, in numbers, one of
the smallest Pitt -soccer teams
ever.

Bern-is says, though, “At this
time we look better. We’ll have
a good young team.” ,

He has had‘ the -booters on
double practice since August 30
and now plains one workout a
day lasting lain h-our or two, as
much as they can get in.

The practice -sessions start out

with a mile run. The goal set for

every player is a 5:30 mil-e.'They
are to keep at it until they can
make it. Thus far only three
players have. .

.Afrter the runrning, the group
jogs for about three, mlinutes,
-then there is a ball handling ses-
sion scheduled to lastten min-
utes. Eight 220-dashes follow
with a m-inute rest peniod in be-
-tween. ’

This followed by a 32+second
space and then a ‘ten minu-t-e ball
control session. Then, there is
one more Ithing—a»not-her try at
the mile.

This sounds like a lot of work,
and it is. But Bemis says that
they have reached this schedule

gradually.

“They began lightly last win-
ter and were told what to be
prepared for this fall,” the coach

comments.

He "adds, “It helps us to do
just what we have to do.'If we
work an hour,-it’~s going to be

\vo1‘k.”’

.Who are these men who are
working so. hard? One of them
is Len Harmon. Harmon is. t‘ie
captain and the .squad’s only
goalie, but he works as hard as

anybody else. «

No-rm Roux, a letterm-an; re~
turns at Middle Full Back. Mike

Schalk and Wayne Kaiser also

look like .s=tro_«ng candidates for

fullback positions. '

Kaiser is also being 7consider-

ed as a possible half back. Other
‘returning halfbacks are Bob
Qu-ienl-in and Angelo Stoylas.

Two linemen regarded highly

by Bemis are Ian Baguley and
Bob Trexler. Stoyas, also, can
play the lineman’s spot.

Besides these‘ returnees, the
coach is -h'opin-«g ﬁor some fine
. sophomores. ' —.

He doesn’t know yet what
sophs he can rely on, but is
very confident that he  have
some good ones.

He will need all that he can
get, too. This falls schedule is
as rough as ever.

The top-notch opposition is led
‘by Temple, the number one

n-ey- representative last year.

Last year it looked like the football career of
Denny Ferris was over. He couldnt see out of one
eye. At the time George Lies. now Associate Edi-
tor. wrote about Ferris‘ dramatic story. In light of
Ferris" comeback this season. the story is all the

more dramatic.

The ball was on the Blue’s
39 yard line, second down, one
yard to go. Bob Bazylak jammed
the ball into tailback Dennis Fer-
ris‘ gut and Ferris bounced off
tackle for 31 yards. Six plays
later. Baz called on Ferris again:

month that Ferris can see out of
the eye.

Objects still appear fuzzy to
him and sometimes he sees
double. When he goes outside,
he must wear his brown rimmed,
dark glasses because his right pu-
pil is dilated. The doctors want no
strain on his eye.

And it‘s a sad. very depressing
scene watching him stand along
the sidelines during football prac-
tice. “I feel terribly sorry for him
because he wanted to play so bad-

to live up to even before I put on
a uniform again,” said Ferris
as he stabbed at the turf with his
cleats.

His depth perception. not com-
pletely restored yet, creates prob-
lems for him at times. In the cafe-
teria when he goes for milk, he
sometimes spills the milk on the
table instead of in the glass. In
hallways. he walks into people
who weren’t there. On the field,
he can’t catch a thrown football.

He tries to laugh it off. But

Monday, September 9, 1968—'I‘I-IE PITT NEWS—Page 31

Ferris’ Recovery Highlights Dramatic Comeback

deep inside he can’t. He feels
like a cripple. He feels he’ll be
laughed at; the other players will
kid him but it doesn’t affect him
until he’s alone in his room.

And all he wanted was to play
football for the Panthers. “I wan-
ted to play against UCLA and
Notre Dame, I wanted to beat them
for Pitt. I didn’t care where I
played, halfback or defense. I
just wanted to play for Pitt,” said
Ferris.

Each day Ferris goes up the
hill to practice. He jogs around
Trees Field to keep in shape. Then
he walks around. H_e talks to spec-
tators and friends. But he always
watches the field.

He stays for an hour or longer,
then before the other players
leave the field, he heads for the
Stadium and a warm shower.

And all the time, in his mind,
he knows he can’t let down all
those people who said he’d be
great.

long track season that started last August. But he wouldn’t

Before then, though, Richey
would have -to survive prelim-
imaries Saturday, which will
eliminate four runners, and
semi-finals Sunday, which will
cut two more.MThe six man field
Mexico City Stakes goes off
Monday at approximately 4:30
Lake Tahoe, California time.

Jerry is one Pitt sophomore
press clippings. But despite his
past achievements, he is not over-
Iy enthusiastic about his chances
for the Olympics. Granting Ryutn
and Dave Patrick of Villanova
spots on the team, Richey rates
his own chances at .one in
eight. ,
“Roscoe Devine and Marty Li-
quori look real good, too,” add-
ed Richey. “Devine lost to Ryun

by only two seconds and Li-
quori only lost by six-tenths of
a second.

“Last year Ryun was six sec-
onds better than anybody,” he
continued, “This year, it’s only
two or three. If he’s bothered
by his mononucleosis, it’s not
noticeable. But he doesn’t have
to worry about making the fin-
als or making the team. He just
concentrates on winning the gold
medal.” .

Ricl1ey’s not in‘that position.
But all along, he’s been point-
ing towards next weekend. He’s
run several trial races, but he
doesn't take them very seriously.

“I didn’t,taper f_or any of
those races like some of the
other guys/‘he reported. “I just
ran right through them. I didn’t
do too badly. I finished third a
couple -times.” * -

tapering lS that, for Instance,
he ran one race the day after
a 15-mile workout. Ryun recen-t-
ly tapered to a 3:43 1500 clock-
ing. Richey’s best at Tahoe is
an unpushed 3:55. That was
some time back, and he is con-
fident of having lowered it sign-

ificantly since that time.

Jerry stopped l1om e for a
couple days last week, but ad-
mitted that he wasn’t really
homesick and that it was just
part of his training.

“It’s good to go up to the
high altitude, then down for
awhile, and good to go back
again,” he explained. “I went
down to Los Angeles for a
peek, too.

“I don’t like high altitude
running,” Richey admitted, “but
it’s really not -any worse than
regular, ‘except you can’t work
as hard.”

For the most part, the hard
work is behind Jerry Richey.
This Week he’_ll do some light
training, sharpening work, and
he'll relax for a couple days.
It’s been a long season, but
maybe it’l1 stretch a‘little long-
er.

Talented Newcomers
Steal Spotlight From
Only Senior Harrier

The case of Ken Lawton,
cross country runner, in
many respects is similar to
that of this year’s football sen-
iors. He is one of the last recruits
of a former coach, and little no-
tice is taken of him because of
abundance of talented sopho-
mores.

Lawton’s career has hardly been
spectacular, but as the team’s
only senior he merits more rec-
ognition than he’s going to get.
He’s a pretty happy-go-lucky guy
who doesn't care much about pub-
licity, but by the same token he’s
the type of kidder who can keep
the. younger members of the team
loose.

KEN LAWTON
Lone Senior Ifarrier

GIRL’S GYM

Women’s gymnastics practice
will begin tomorrow at 6 p.m. in
Trees Hall gym. All girls inter-
ested should report to the gym.
Miss Santillo is the coach.

Ken spoke of pride. too. Pride
in himself and pride in the team’.
“It’s going to be a good season
for the team,” he predicted. “I
hope to be in the top ﬁve . . .
somewhere. I don’t plan on being
pushed out. But there’ll be a lot
of switching around among num-
ber 3. 4, and 5 men.”

Even if he were to finish out of
the first five, Lawton explained
how the number 6, 7, and 8 men
can help while not contributing
to the score. If any of the extra
men finished ahead of the other
team’s first five, it helps to push
up their score, and the low score
wins.

Normally, the top senior on a
team wouldn't have to consider
ﬁnishing out of the running, but
this year’s edition of the harriers
is special and Lawton is consid-
ering anything he can do to help.
As a result ‘he doesn't feel the
usual pressures on a senior.

“The Dressure’s 011?,” he admit-
ted. ”There’s enough good run-
ners around that nobody is look-
ing at anybody else. _

“They all know what they want
to do,” Ken added, “and it doesn't
make any difference what I want‘
to do. We’re just a small, close
group and we don’t need to set
examples for each other.”

Ken joked about going out in a
blaze of glory, but as he ticked
off the names of Nolan. Rodgers,
Vornhagen, and Richey, the pros-
pects became a bit dimmer.

But Lawton hardly considers
his efforts fruitless. He expects
to-.and most likely will help the
team. And in the winter, when
the squad moves indoors, the out-
look is even brghter. Lawton
hopes to break a record or two
as part of the two-mile relay. It
might even get him noticed,

Sophomore Strength KeyTo
Banner’s High Expectatins 

By BILL NAAB

If the cross country season turns out to be a sweet
success, coach Jim Banner will be the least surprised.

Although only two members of his squad, Paul Zink
and Ken Lawton, return this fall, Banner still has reason to sound
optimistic. His many fine sophomores are expected to provide sta-

bility to the squad.

As freshmen last season, they went undefeated in eight meets.
When they defeated Penn State and were barely edged out by George-
town in the IC4A freshmen championships, the frosh demonstrated

their powerful capabilities. In

fact at the present time Banner

can not single out one or two, or

even three of his runners who"

might be considered the heart of
p the nsqiiao.

“Paul Zink, Greg Rodgers,

Kenny Lawton, Mike Nolan,

John Aiken, and Mark Vornha-
gen all have been running well.
And if sophomore Jerry Richey
rejoins the squad from the O-
lympic trials, it'll be whipped
cream on Sunday,”
Banner.

commented

MIICE NOLAN
Prornising Sophomore

 

By September 14, Richey will
know if he will join the Olympic
team or the Un.iver.sity cross
country squad. Banner stated,
“Richey has a good outlook on
the Olympics and hes got an
open mind. He knows it’s a real
tough field. They’re no easy ones
there. If he doesn’t make,thc
olympics and rejoins ou-r squad
next week, I don’t think that
he'll suffer a letdown.”

Even though Banner believes
that he has a good squad, _he
also realizes thiat he will meet
stiff -competition. “There are
many good track teams on the
schedule, tougher teams every
year,” the coach remarked.

Banner’s squad will compete
against the likes of Kent State,
Ohio University, Penn State, and
West Virginia. In addition, they
will enter the IC4AAs - and the
Notre Dame Invitational. On
September 21 the distancemen
will meet Ohio University and
Kent State in a rugged triangu-
lar home meet.

Banner stated that he can’t
really rank his team with his
-competition, since he actually
doesn’t know much about his
opponents. Still, he realizes the
beginning of the season will be
a difficult challenge.

Spring Sports In Review

Spring sports repeatedly get
lost in the shuffle at a Uni-
versity where the majority of
the students go home in April.
The overall spring picture was
-pleasant. although not outstand-
mg.

For instance. the baseball team
finished on a happy note. winning
its last seven games in a row.
George McKenzie signed with
the Cincinnati Reds and proceed-
ed to hit .375 in a rookie league.

But the promise the team show-
ed in winning three games in the
Riverside Invitational Tourna-
ment in March was washed away
in the early-April showers. It
took too long for the mitters to
untrack themselves, and any tour-
ney hopes went out the window.
The season did include double-
header sweeps of Syracuse and
Penn State.

Track was another bright spot,
largely due to sophomores Jerry
Richey, and Bryant Salter. One or
the other was continually break-

ing school records. The team’s—

high point was a second place
finish in the annual Quadrangu-
lar Meet with Penn State, Syra-
cuse, and West Virginia. Actual-

ly, the thinclads took the most
first places of any team, but a
lack of depth cost them a chance
at first place.

In May. Richey became the
first Pitt runner to break four
minutes in the mile. He clocked
a 3258.6 while finishing fourth
in the IC4A’s championships in
Philadelphia. Later he placed in
the NCAA’s 1500 meter class.
and he’s currently trying for a
berth in the 1500 meters on the
Olympic team.

The golf picture was fairly
bleak. A couple rainouts cost Rex
Peery‘s charges a chance at an
even split; but in the larger tour-
naments. the duffers fared even
worse.

Rainouts cost the tennis team a
plus season, too. The netters fin-
ished 7-8, with two sure wins can-
celled by the weather. The out-

look for next season is not good,
though. Four of the top six play-
ers graduate. Sophomore J.D.
Lewis showed flashes of brilli-
ance when he played, but spring
football prevented him from get-
