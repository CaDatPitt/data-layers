Bulletin!

vice yesterday with instructions to report to Parris Island. South Caro-
lina, on Oct. 25. They are End Chris Warriner, Halfback Jim Campbell,
and Tackle Bill Gasparovic - all regulars. The three will see‘ action

against Rice and Northwestern.

Thus far, the Marines have called six Panthers, the first three

By WILL DOERGEL
The Cotton Bowl champions, the Rice Owls, help the Pitt Pan-
thers open their 195O home football campaign when they clash
with Len Casanova’s new "T” team at the Pitt Stadium tomorrow.
Kickoff time is 2 p.m. Odds-makers have the Owls a 13-point

favorite over Pitt.

Jess Neely’s Rice team is again rated one of the top teams in
the Southwest Conference. They are one of the few undefeated
major collegiate elevens in the nation, while Pitt is still seeking

its first win.

25,000 To Watch
A crowd of better than 25,000 is expected for the game. High
school day should attract five thousand district high school stu-

dents to the Stadium.

For the first time this season,
Casanova will resort to a two-
I' platoon system.
Casanova ex-
plained his
move this way.
"Instead of
‘dividing up the
players prac-
tice time be-
tween offense
and defense,
we can concen-
trate on de-
fense with one
group and of-
fense with an-
other.

“We expect to have an offen-
sive and defensive line to throw
§_ against Rice, but we don’t have
 _the backfield material to be ex-
g clusively a two-platoon team.”

Plagued by the lack of a suitable
meeting hour that will conform to
everyone’s schedule, Men's Council

still managed to have 20 members
at its meeting Tuesday at one time
or another.

In an effort to solve the attend-
ance situation, Ralph Thorne dis-
tributed forms to the members so
that an idea could be obtained as
to the best possible time for a
meeting.

Several of the men had only three
or four free hours during the week.

After a heated discussion, Vic-
tor Kasmierski, bus ad junior, was
elected to the council to replace Al
Goldberg, who resigned recently.

Saalbach is New Advisor

William F. Saalbach, faculty ad-
visor replacing retiring  .\lcln-
tosh, was present at the meeting
and stated that he was "pleased”
with things in general. \lcIntosh
was honored at a dinnerin his honor
at the Phi Epsilon Pi house Wed-

Saalbach was attending his first

when he was a member of the group.

Varsity Band to Unveil
New Show at Rice Game

Pitt's 120-piece varsity marching band stages its home debut

football scene in a new and im-

sitting in the pressbox of Ohio
the Pitt band’spre-game routine

was "one of the finest things I've
ever seen.”

During half-time, the band will
pay tribute to Pennsylvania.

The band sings “Surrey With the
Fringe on Top,” dances to “Penn-
sylvania Polka,” and marches
through six intricate formations.

Opening formation of the half-time
performance is a keystone. The
state emblem is followed by a lib-
erty bell that swings to and fro,

Next is the surrey (picturesque
mode of travel in Lancaster county)

with revolving wheels. This ex-
plodes into a pick and shovel with
the band playing "Whistle While
You Work.”

Five circles are then formed. The
middle one plays as the other four
dance the polka. The circles then
become the wheels of industry.

Pitt will offer a greatly curtailed program for High School Day

COIHOITOW.

High School Day itself will give the high school students the
opportunity to attend the game at a reduced rate. The pre-game
rally and the traditional post-game tea dance will not be in the

program because the remodeling

of Syria l-losqueis not finished,

Clinics Planned

The University High School Day
Committee, to make up for the cur-
tailed program, will work closely
with the publications office in
arranging clinics and conferences
for interested high school students
later in the spring.

Besides acquainting the high
school students with the inner
workings of University activities,

orientation will be given on the
social side of Pitt campus life.

“The idea of the program is to
interpret university life to the high
school students,” said T.W. Biddle,
chairman of the High School Day
Committee.

Band Entertains

The Pitt Band will entertain with
a special "Pennsylvania Week”
half-time show.

The YMCA, in cooperation with
the dean of men's office and the
Hi-Y Clubs of Allegheny County
will hold a rally at Stephen Foster
Memorial at 10:30 a.m. for Hi-Y
members only. Jack Morgan, chair-
man of the Hi-Y Rally and members
of the YMCA will put on a skit
dramatizing Pitt activities. H. C.
Carlson, head basketball coach,
will speak on “Students in Extra-
curricular Activities.”

"No, my dear fellow, l said we're going to BEAT Rice
tomorrow."

Unconcerned or Dumb?

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Does Your Newspaper
l.ook_Different lately?

This edition of the Pitt News, undergraduate student news-
paper of the University of Pittsburgh, obviously represents a de-
parture from the normal 8000-copy distribution to students and
faculty of the University, since an additional 30,000 copies are
being distributed throughout downtown Pittsburgh today.

__ Its primary purpose is to publicize tomorrow's opening home
football game with Rice University at Pitt Stadium, with the se-
condary aim of making Pittsburghers aware of the Pennsylvania
Week celebration proclaimed by the Governor for next week.

It is in no way an attempt to supplant the Pittsburgh daily
newspapers, although ‘outside’ news is being run as a service
to our regular readers, When the dailies resumepublication, this
special service will be discontinued.

Wanted: $2 500

Does anyone happen to have 32500 they can spare?

That’s about what it will cost to put the Pitt band on the
field at Notre Dame Nov. 11, where a sizable number of Ameri-
cans can get a look at the country’s Number 1 collegiate band,
either directly or on their television sets.

The University, scrimping along on a tightened budget,
doesn’t have it. The Pitt News certainly doesn’t have it either.
But somebody has it, even if it's 5000 undergraduate students
who own it collectively in the form of half dollars.

A lot of people would like to see the band get to South Bend
one way or another; George Conley, the receiving room agent,
swears he’s gaing to stand outside the elevators with a hat.

We don’t have any suggestions, but we’d like to hear some.
Got any ideas?

Either the American college student of today feels he is too
lily white to mess with ugly politics, or he‘ is too damn dumb to
know what is going on around him.

It used to be that college students were known as radical
political thinkers who could be counted on to whip up an or-

ganized protest at the drop of a
reactionary pin. The political red
necks Vere especially prevalent
in Europe, but they were not lack-
ing in the United States, by any
means.

Sure, the college boys were too
immature, too unqualified to know
what they were screaming about.
But at least they were concerned,
and they were thinking.

Retiring Individuals

Today, in the midst of a full-
scale purge on free thinking, there
has been scarcely a murmur of or-
ganized collegiate thought, either
pro or con. Apparently Joe College
has become a retiring individual

who, while taking great sartorial
care before his morning mirror,
neither knows nor cares if his poli-
tical pants are being stolen off
his unconcerned hide.

Last month Congress passed
the Communist Control Bill, a
piece of legislation dedicated to
the proposition that allcampaign-
ing Congressmen should get lots
of votes this fall. President Tru-
man called the bill a method of
“thought control.”

At the University of California
the Board of Regents is currently
trying to enforce a demand that
faculty members sign non-Commu-
nist oaths. The action is an af-

front to the loyalty of the faculty,
and 163 professors have been
fired for their refusal to comply.
Please Picket Anybody

Now in those two developments
there certainly should be sufficient
meat to stir living and breathing
college students into picketing
somebody -- anybody. But appa-
rently we cannot assume that
collegians are living and breath-
ing anymore.

Outside of the Young Progres-
sives, there hasn’t been a genuine-
ly important student political
group on the Pitt campus in this
post-war era. And the Young
Progressives were not student-
born. They were projected by
the Commie high command.

So it seems as if the innards
have disappeared from the Ameri-
can college man. The only way to
get him excited is to change the
styles in sport coats.

Uneditorially Speaking

Some of the effects of the Pittsburgh newspaper strike are

being felt around Pitt.

Last Wednesday only about 200 people turned out to hear
Robert Frost, New England’s great nature poet, at the Carnegie

Museum Lecture Hall.

Lack of publicity combined with bad weather knocked attend-

down to the point where the crowd
barely filled the seats in the "pit”
of the lecture hall.

Frost, a kindly grandfather type
with expressive, ever-moving hands,
charmed the crowdwith his intimate
chat about history and poetry.

And at the University adjustments
to the strike are also being made,
Professor Robert X. Graham is con-
sidering offering a new course in
his journalism department.

New Course Proposed

After consideringthe wages which
the mailers on the Pittsburgh
papers make at present and the new
increases which they are demanding,
Mr. Graham offers this proposal:

He will teach a one-credit course
in wrapping newspapers (which is
what the mailers do). The class
will meet once during the semester.
Half the class period will be used
for smoking and kibitzing. In the
other half he will teach the class
members all he knows about news-
paper wrapping.

Just for this issue, which appears on the eve of one of the
most crucial football contests of Pitt's post-war gid history, I’d
like to step down from the editorial ivory tower, discard the
editorial ‘we,’ and invade the iron-curtained regions of the sports
department. I do this at the risk of drawing criticism from genera-

tions of editors and sports editors
who have scrupulously observed the
unseen but nevertheless rigid bar-
riers that separate their respective
spheres of coverage and comment.

The greenest sports reporter on
the staff is more familiar with Pitt's
position and immediate future on the
gridiron than I, but it is not with
strategy or conditioning or depth
of the physical factors that make a
winning football team that I am
concerned here.

‘The Old College Try’

My subject is that indefinable
something that makes collegiate
football the least predictable major
sport in the world; the spirit that,
ranging from grim determination
to almost religious zeal, was
labelled many years ago as ‘the
old college try.’

Pitt football fans have seen that
spirit work in Pitt's favor several
times in the last few years: against
Ohio State in 1947; against Penn
State in 1948, and again in 1949;
against Northwestern and in the
final minutes of the Pennsylvania
game last year. They saw it work
against us last year also, when a
game Indiana team swamped the
high-riding Panthers whose only
other losses were to ropflight Ohio
State and Minnesota.

Several thousand Pitt spectators
saw the absolute absence of that
spirit last week when Ohio State's

/

varsity and reserves trampled Over
a demoralized Blue and Gold team
in Columbus. ‘

No one, least of all the players
themselves, can adequately ex-
plain why the Pitt team lost so dis-
astrously a game they should have
been ‘up’ for.

Where Was It?

But it can be said that, apart from
other factors, the lack of the slight-
est trace of anything approaching a
winning spirit characterized the Pitt
team throughout the game. Why that
should be so on that part’ ular day
is something for psychologists to
debate.

A victory tomorrow could go far
to wipe away the disappointment of
last week's exhibition, and lay the
groundwork for a season like the
last two, when a spirited bunch of
players demonstrated that sheer
guts and determinationcould humble
teams packed solid with superior
ability and material.

A defeat,on the other hand, could
make the inevitable beginning of the
blackest football year in the last
decade.

And the balance lies in that in-
definable something that can't be
trained into anyplayer by any coach,
that can't be bought by the richest
school; the thingthat scientists call
‘psychological drive’ and that edit-
orial writers call spirit.

It’s that most hackneyed of‘

cliches, the ‘Old College Try.’

Let's Have It

Someday those same scientists
who now define the thing will dis-
cover a sure-fire method of creating
it, and football coaches will develop
variations of the methodjust asthey
now use variations of formations
and conditioning practices.

Unfortunately, Len Casanova has
to put a spirited team tomorrow,
and his abilities at arousing that
winning spirit are no better than
any coach’s. He does know, how-
ever, that an eager, shouting,
10,000-voice crowd of fellow stu-
dents can help create it, help be-
fore and during the game.

The only block in the way of
getting that crowd is the small
group of prematurelymellowed wise-
acres who label anysuchdemonstra-
tion as ‘rah-rah’ stuff, success-
fully shrinking all but the least
inhibited fans into a muttering state
of self-conscious silence.

I say (backed by Captain Tom
Hamilton, Coach Len Casanova,
and the guys who have to do the
fighting on the field) that if such
rah-rah enthusiasm will help win
games, let's have a large order of

all his money on an education.
With his knowledge of the techni-

que of wrapping newspapers he
will be able to leave school and
get a job which will pay him con-
siderably more than reportingwould,
says Mr. Graham.

Picturesque Poly Sci

The political science department
has something new to offer in the
way of text books.

Although I haven't started read-
ing the books yet for Mrs. Lutz’s

through the table of contents.

If the table is any indication the

listed are "Picturesque Peru,”
"Cultured Columbia," “Volatile
Venezuela,” "Exotic Ecuador,”

“Utopian Uraguay,” “Primitive
Paraguay,” “Bleak Bolivia,” and
"Crossroads Cuba.” Next in line
is the completely prosaic “The
Island of Haiti.”

It appears that "public service”
is becoming a full-time job any more
so we might as well get in on it
too.

Nears Pitt
Record

District fans who attend the
home opener of the Pitt Panthers
against the Owls of Rice Institute
at the Stadium Saturday may see a
new record Written into the Pitt
books.

Nick Bolkovac, veteran left
tackle from Youngstown, Ohio, is
near the all-time Pitt record for
points after touchdowns during his
career at Pitt. Thus far, Bolkovac
has made 34 of 41 attempts and
now is only two short of the Pitt
record of 36, set by Andy Hastings
during 1914-15-16-19.

Bolkovac entered this season
with a mark of 31 in 38 attempts
and converted twice against
Duke and once against Ohio
State to move close to Hasting’s
mark.

The Rice Owls come to the Stadium tomorrow sporting an 11-game
winning streak. The Owls won their last nine games last year, and have

started off this season with two wins.

LSU spoiled Head Football Coach
Jess Neely’s bid for an unbeaten,
season in 1949 with a 14-7 win.

Rice's opening victory this year
was against Len Casanova’s old
alma mater, Santa Clara, 27-7.

at at II

of the entire 56-man Rice foot-
ball squad, only one player is not
fran Texas. The lone exception, is
Bud dyEdwards, a sophomore tackle.

Edwards comes from Texarkana,
Arkansas. He was born several
hundred yards from the Texas bor-
(lot, which separates the town.

If you’re wondering why Little

Monday Program Starts
New Hamilton Policy

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
The Athletic Department, in a move to place added emphasis
on the physical education and athletic participation of its under-
graduate students, has taken far-reaching steps toward interest-

ing freshmen students .

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton recently proposed the "Phys
Ed for All” plan which, if enacted, will commit undergraduate

students to gym classes five days
a week for four years. The plan,
although not yet enacted, is under
careful consideration.

Annual Affair

Now, Ben Grady, varsity swim-
ming coach, and Leo Bemis, intra-
mural director, with the backing of
Hamilton have proposed another
plan.

The program, labled the Freshmen

All-Campus Athletic Week Sports
Program, will be an annual fall
activity under the direction of the
IM Department.

Three Purposes
its purpose can be broken down
into three distinct categories:

1 - To secure recognition for
frosh students as athletic champ-
ions in their class.

2 - To introduce new students
as potential members to the honor-
ary athletic fraternity, Sigma Delta
Psi. '

3 - To give freshmen the opport-
unity to display their talents before
athletic coaches and to pit their
skills against that of their class-
mates.

competition for football, basketball,
track, and baseball events. Trees
Pool will host the tankers and

Schenley Golf Course will host the ,

golfers.

Bemis hopes that a plaque bear-
ing the names of the eventual title-
holders will be placed in the new
field house now under construction.

Events included in the sports
program are:

Mon.. Tues.
Football (Throw for distance, kick for
distance.)

Baseball (throw for distance, fungo hit-
ting for d stance)

Wed.. 'l‘hurs.

Track (50-yard dash, 16-pound shot for
distance, running broad jump

Basketball (obstacle drib ling, foul
shootin

Golf (drive golf balls for distance)

Swimming (40-yard free style, 40-yard
backstroke, 40-yard breaststroke)

Triple-'l‘hreat Grid Hero
At 129 Pounds

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

The announcement that high school students will be admitted
to the Stadium tomorrow at cut rates is of interest not to the teen-
agers alone. No, it sets at least one other heart to pounding.

You see, it was on High School
Day of 1948 that Kopelman, who
exists at 129 pounds, five feet
five inches, was mistaken for a
gridiron warrior and swamped by
several dozen of America's auto-
graph-crazy youth.

Maybe Sinatra

Now it is possible to imagine
Kopelman being mistaken for
Sinatra, but it takes one helluva
mind to picture him as a football
gladiator. The last time he played
football he was flattened by a 240-
pound mass of humanity, and im-
mediately subscribed to the theory
that the healthiest exercise for a
shrimp is a long hike in the woods.

Yet to the kids, he was a col-
lege player, no less.

Here is how the confusion start-
ed that Saturday afternoon in ’48.

It is "High School Day” at the

Stadium and the Pitt players are
busy establishing themselves as
heroes in the eyes of several thou-
san_d youngsters by beating Mar-
quette. After the game, about 35
kids gather outside,the dressing
room in the hope of getting somd
autographs.
- Kopelman, it develops, is the
first to emerge from the room,
having gone in merely to have a
few words with the winning coach.
To these urchins, however, he is
the first bite of the day, and they
cheerfully procede to reel him in
by his sleeves, the back of his
coat, and any other apparel they
can get their hands on.

It does not do him any good to
deny that he is Bill McPeak or
Nick Bolkovac, because the kids
know, of course, that he is only
trying to dodge the penalties of
fame.

To make matters worse, a crowd
of adults begins to collect, and

 

their facial expressions plainly
say, "Who is'this punk who has to
boost his ego by posing as a foot-
ball player?”

The kids, meanwhile, are still

tugging at Kopelman’s clothes,
scraps of paper are being thrust
under his chin, and the old folks
are giving with the cold stares.
Thus embarrassed, the only al-
ternative is capitulation.

The idol does not give out any
signatures, however, but simply
signs the paper with an “X,” for

he does not wish to pose as a

player.
Makes tr Break

Some of the kids seem saris-
fied with the mark, probably be-
cause it is a common notion that
football players can do nothing
but grunt and dig coal, anyhow.
Others walk away, downright
disgusted. With the tension eased,
Kopelman decides to make a break
for the street. A couple of youths
doggedly hang onto his coat, but
he shakes them loose and dashes
across DeSota Street.

When they get a look at his
running form they give up the
chase, probably thinking that it is
no wonder Pitt is no longer a for-
midable gridiron power.

At any rate, Kopelman sur-
vived and is now awaiting with
anticipation the observance of
another High School Day tomorrow.

A mist of secrecy surrounds this
afternoon's grid battle between
Phi Mu and Alpha Epsilon Phi so-
rorities, as both groups conducted
secret workouts earlier this week
in preparation for the battle.

The game is set for 3:30 p.m. at

Unofficial reports from the Phi

halfback from Homestead, will
carry the brunt of the attack.

State Harriers

Face Unbeaten Panthers

Any fears that cross country
coach Carl Olson may have of los-
ing tomorrow’s meet with Penn
State are well—founded.

At 11 a.m. on Flagstaff Hill,
seven veteran Penn State per-
formers will toe the line against
the Panthers. To compete with this
seasoned array, Olson has a team
looking forward to its third victory.

Ken Mahanna, a junior, and
Bernie Luterancik,-, a sophomore,
will be the chief hopes for Pitt.

Mahanna ran the 4-mile course last
Saturday in 23:26 to finish first.
This will be Penn State's first_
competition of the season, one in
which the Lions have high hopes
of finishing undefeated. Pitt has
already defeated Westminster and
Geneva in a triangular meet and
Slippery Rock in a dual affair.
Following the varsity meet the
Pitt frosh will meet the Penn State

frosh in the opener for both squads.

Commons
Dance

By JOHN KULAMER
Student Congress has renewed

its efforts to secure approval of

Commons Room dances.

In their meeting last Monday
the legislators approved a mo-
tion to appoint a committee to
investigate the possibilities of
holding dances not only in the
Commons Room, but in Stephen
Foster Memorial as well.

The question was brought to
Congress’ attention by visitor
Ralph Thorne, Men’s Council,

who originally proposed that the
High School Day Dance, previously
cancelled because of the un-
availability of Syria Mosque, be
held in the Commons Room.

McKinley Appointed

The initially desultory discus-
sion rapidly snowballed into full-
scale debate on the whole Com-
mons Room question, disappeared
for a time in a thick parliamentary
haze, and finally emerged into the
clear air of decision with the ap-
pointment of the investigating com-
mittee. Vice President Bill Mc
Kinley is its chairman.

Congress rejected, however, the
High School Day Dance idea.

Last year there was consider-
able agitation for the unrestricted
use of the Commons Room for
dances and other social functions.

Traditionally it has been used
only for highly formalized affairs
such as Coronation, but last fall,
Dick Kovar, then Student Congress-
man, suggested that it would be a
nice place in which to hold the
annual Christmas Dance.

Students in Favor

Student and faculty reaction to
the idea was said to be favorable,
but it was then too late in the sea-
son to take any action.

However, Congress did approve
a resolution expressing itself in
favor of holding 1950’% Graduation
Dance and Christmas Dance there.

Nothing more was done about
the matter, however, because of
strong opposition from University
authorities, who objected on the
ground that Commons Room danc-
ing was a violation of school tra-
dition. They also feared that it
would jeopardize contributions
to the projected Student Center,
in that it would eliminate the need
for a dance floor in that building.

Jacob Elected
Other business transacted by
Congress included the election of
Earl Jacob as senior representa-
tive by a vote of nine to seven.

Special Train
Seats Going

An overwhelming demand for tic-
kets to the Notre Dame game on
Nov. 11 has forced the athletic de-
partment to squeeze out 100 more
accommodations for the Panther-
lrish Special, including absolutely
the only tickets left to the game.

Of the 100 tickets, 70 are now on
sale at the Student Desk and the
other 30 have been given to the
Alumni Association.

Since there are now 800 traveling
to South Bend, organizers of the
trip are contemplating splitting the
Special up into two trains,the Blue

'__Panther and_'Gold Panther.

If you don’t want to get lost

As of today, appointments have
been filled to Oct. 19, he remarked
and over 300 books have been
sold. Many students, he added,
are trying to beat the Nov. 17
deadline, when Owls go from $6 to
37.

Picture appointments for those
in schools outside the Cathedral
may be made by calling the Owl

salesman at the Student Desk.

Poet Frost’s

Talk Spans

,   Years, Hits Many Topics

BY ROBERT FLANIGAN
Time moved forward and then nearly backward on Wednesday

evening in Carnegie Institute’s

lecture hall as the 75-year old

poet, Robert Frost, made the audience almost want to become
little boys and swing out on the limbs of birches when he recited

his poem, “Birches.”
When Frost said, "Your the boy

that can make the words say that .

you mean it,” he gave the answer
to his own success. When he was
17, Frost sold his first poem, “My
Butterfly,” to a magazine, “The
Independent,” for $15. Then he
just made common words tell what
he wished to convey. Later, he
used ‘this formula and won the
coveted litzer Prize four times.
"I have lived in poetry from child-
hood,” he asserted.

Poetry and Science
In plain English Frost stated
that there shouldn't be any issue
between poetry and science. In his
poetry he admitted that he craved

for something different. “Validity
that’s what you stand or fall by,”
Frost expressed. He believes that
poetry deals more with belief than
unbelief. To stress this point he
referred to poetry as, "another kind
of truth.”

"I got a distaste for ghost writ-
ing,” Frost declared as heclenched
both his fists. To some people it
didn’t matter whether Roosevelt
wrote his own speeches or not, but
to Frost it did.

Frost asserted his dislike to-
wards critics who read his poems
and took hints from them when he
hadn't written anyhints there.Some—
times when he inserted hints they

A either ignored them or else didn’t

see them.

Can Horses Talk"

Frost made the audience laugh
heartily when he told them how he
lectured before another group and
recited one of his poems in which a
horse seemingly could speak. “Can
a horse ask questions?”a Harvard
professor inquired. F-rost looked
towards his.friend,_ Frank Dobie,
who answered for him. “Yes, better
than most professors.”

Frost pleasantly chilled the and-
ience when he recited a group of
his poems. There wasn’t even a
cough until he finished a poem.
Then the people applauded heartily.
and readied themselves for the next
one.
