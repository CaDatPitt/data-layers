Q?

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Recent reports from the College
of Arts and Sciences (CAS) iifdicate
the University will be facing some
fundamental decisions about ad-

. missions policies, decisions that
could» ‘change the fabric of the

institution. 0
A published report to the faculty
of the College‘ outlines what are
3 seen as grave disparities between
the kind of students Pitt ‘accepts,
and the yardsticks by which they are
measured, the programs in which
they are taught and the tenure
structure that - produces their

" teachers. ‘ - A ,

The options facing the Univer-

sity, the report stated, are either to A

' toughen admission standards for
' incoming freshmen, or to provide
the kinds of academic services
needed by incoming students under

' the old criteria. _
Dean of CA5’ Robert Marshall

_ recently stated the‘ last thing _he

173 tickets that have been sold is a
dismal amount for a facility that
accommodates 3,000 people,” SGB
member Larry Krain said. “A free
concert is attractive ‘ to many
people.” '

The concert, to start at 8 p.m. in -

the Field House, will be open
exclusively to persons presenting
University identiﬁcation and a free
ticket secured at the Student Union
ticket office.

Musician Freddie Hubbard will
headline the show, which has been
a center of controversy since SGB
authorized the Student Govern-
ment Programming Committee to
produce the show on behalf of the
Black Action Society (BAS). In past
years, BAS produced its -own
concert, but this year BAS imput
_was to choosing the act and
handling advertising. .

Discussion at Wednesday
meeting focused on reasons for the
low- ticket sales. BAS members
said they did not order black
students‘ to boycott the shown to
protest Student Government Board

- (SGB) involvement, and linked the

low ticket purchases with the
original ticket price of ~33. They
said some black students may feel
strongly ‘ against .the_ SGB’s
handling of the concert. g 
“BAS has successfully produced

its. own ‘Black Week concert in the‘

past three or four years,” BAS
programming chairman Joy Wilson
said. “Black students may view

decision, for moral as ‘ well ‘as
philosophical reasons. _

“We (Pitt).act as if we have a
highly selective student body when
in fact we have about 1000 kids on
probation, and considering grade
inﬂation you could probably add
another 1500 to that number by
standards ten years ago.

‘‘I’m not proposingthat admis-
sions policies be toughened. The

— CAS Council is simply ouﬂining a

problem and telling the faculty what

“ might be possible solutions,

assuming everyone agrees there is -a
problem in the ﬁrst place.”
According to Marshall between

tone-fourth and one-third of last

year's incoming ' freshman class
were below the national average in
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores.

' . “Remember, that’s an average
taken from every high school kid in
the country, going to Podunk U. as
well as Harvard. In our curriculum,

Government Programming concert
instead of their own show;”

Carl Redwood, a member of the
BAS steering committee, explained
black students have encountered
ﬁnancial problems and added,
“Giving tickets away free would
increase attendance for sure.” .

Krain announced a possible
restructuring of Pitt Programming

that would include creation of a ‘

steering committee to exercise
financial authority within

Ciw'sTicket PowerDeb°*ed

BY PAUL Mkrnnws

Pittsburgh City Council President
Eugene P. DePasquale said rec-
ently tickets issued by city meter
maids are illegal, although the
Mayor’s office and the City Solicitor
claim there is nothing‘ wrong with
the current ticket procedure.

DePasquale said according to a
1973 city ordinance, tickets can only
be written ‘by policeofﬁcers and
specially designated members of
the Public Safety Department.

Meter maids are employes‘ of the
City Treasurer's Ofﬁce and there-
fore have no authorization- to write
tickets, he said. p .

No one, not even DePasquale,
can announce a law is one way or
another, said Executive Secretary to

‘ Mayor Pete.Flaherty, Bruce Camp-

bell.

“I have been in touch with the
City Law Department and they
agree to theillegality of the current
procedure, so as far as I’m
concerned, people who have tickets
shouldn’d pay them,’-’ ‘DePasquale
said. V s

The "present ticket procedure,
contrary to DePasquale’s statement
has been reviewed by the City Law
Department, and they have issued a
written statement supporting the‘
meter maids authorization to write
tickets, Campbell said. «

The Mayors Oﬁce’ ‘ and the City

Solicitor's stand, as well as the Law "

Department's written statement is a
ﬂagrant example of Nixon stone-
walling, WIIC Action Line reporter
Wayne Van Dyne said. “-I’ve been

said.

and see for themselves that meter

DePasquale said.

BY BOB rnunenmi

Since Nobel laureate Linus
Pauling claimed massive doses'of
vitamin C prevent the common cold,
some‘ ‘ Pitt students may have
crammed vitamin C into themselves
with hopes of escaping the winter
sniffles.

A recent study by Pitt medical
faculty ‘shows, however, such
efforts are probably in vain. The
study conducted with 868 Arizona
Indian children, indicates vitamin C I
has little, if any, value in preventing
the common cold, according to .
faculty and research team member
Dr. John Coulehan. '

. Since the Council report was

 ‘ ‘Although my personal views are
not important here, ’ ’ Marshall said,
“I happen to feel happy with our
current student body. I think the
spectrum of students we admit each
‘year is good for the institution.

‘ The question is what happens to
-those students once they get into
the University?” Marshall said.
.A‘ ‘Some of them just aren’t making it
and we here at Pitt have to.make
some basic decisions as to what kind

Although vitamin C doesn't work,
there are ways to reduce the risk of
getting the common cold, accordin
to Coulehan. .-

' _ “Students who are in good
health, eat a well-balanced diet, and
get’ adequate rest have better
resistance to colds than those who
stay up all night studying, don't get

' any exercise, and eat every day at

McDonalds,” Coulehan said.
Once a cold starts, Coulehan said,

‘ the only thing a person can do is

work directly on the_symptoms by
taking aspirin to relieve painful
joints and a decongestant to ease
breathing.

While Coulehan said he doubts
the beneﬁts of vitamin C, he also
said there are no ill side effects from
it. .

Admission Policy Clarified  

‘‘If we decide we’re here to serve
a broader based student population,

then we’ll have to make some
adjustments in our educational
policy and philosophy,” he added-
" The admissions policy issue may
touch on some ‘of the basic
structures of the University.
Marshall said, primarily to;-the
weight given to student instruction
as opposed to other academic
pursuits.

“This isn’t anew issiie for the
school by any means,” Marshall
said, ‘ ‘but you can go around taking
positions till doomsday, and unless
you ﬁnd an issue that brings things
to a head, nothing will happen.”

As chairman of CAS Council,
Marshall has called for changes in
Pitt policytowards faculty promo-

Another" 31% were ;$atisﬁed with

the student activities on campus,
while the remaining students
offered no comment. The $12
activity fee is used to fund various
student activities.

Of the 55 students who consider
student activity funding ineﬂicient,
most cited lack of diversity in the
programs and a scarcity of activities

1 sponsored this term.

“M/hen you think of all teh
students paying $12 each, you’d
think we’d be getting a higher
return of programs than we are
now,” senior biology major Robert
Turner said.

Grace Jivens, a senior majoring
in sociology said, “The programs
are not diversiﬁed enough.‘ They
should be more involved with the
black students. By consolidating
this year’ s Black Week Concert with
Student Government, they took
away input from the Black Action
Society as a whole.”

Senior psychology and economics
major Sharon Marlowe said Pitt
should sponsor lecturers who are
more interesting for the students.
“Whey ‘can’t Pitt get Jimmy
Carter?” she said. “He goes to

other colleges. What makes Pitt so‘

different? I’d be ecstatic if he came
here.” I .

Bill Kalman, a senior in political
science, said he believes most
decisions concerning the $12 fee are
made by a “student bourgeois who
collaborate‘ with the administra-
tion," and called for an increase in
Student Government membership.

Friday, November 12, 1976—THE, PITT NEWS—Pagé'pi3 .1    

Activities Fee Use Inefficient 

‘-‘I’m not opposed to the way its set
up now, but Ithink an apparatus can
be set up to determine how students
can democratically voice their
preference as to how the money
should be used.” _

“I know the movies shown here
are - certainly diversiﬁed,.” ,Rick
Luisi, ' a sophomore engineering
student said. ‘‘I knovivgwthey
wouldn’t _ pick events students
wouldn't be interested in.”

Awarding to junior pre-dent
student Dave  , “Pitt
has already sponsored enough
speakers to warrant the spending of
$12. Ralph Nader, Jerry Brown—in
my opinion they were all excellent.
Pitt has deﬁnitely been eﬁcient in
securing programs for students.”

Debbie Wallace, a sophomore in
business administration said, “I

like the movies. Ithink they provide .

a nice relief from studying.”

Darryl Codgill, a sophomore in
economics said he likes all the
activities. “Football games,
movies—they’re all very exciting.
Especially the football games,.
because Pitt’s number one.”

The cancelled Homecoming con-

’ cert, that would have brought Ian

Matthews to Pitt, surfaced often
during the interviews, with stu-
dents leveling blame on various

Student Government committees

for the mishandling of the event.

“The mneellation of the concert
was the failure of the Student
Government system itself,” com-
mented, Jeﬁ Leaf,’ a freshman
engineer. “The organizations
responsible for securingan act were
not lending guidance to one
another. The heads of the
committees should have discussed
together plans for a concert to help
resolve the lack of communication. ’ ’

One student, who requested to be
unidentiﬁed, said “It’s the Student
Government's Board (SGB) fault.
Evidently, Barry Weisband (SGB
President) is not motivating the
people under him. I don’t think he’s
living up to his campaign promises,
either.”

Arthur Weinblum, a senior in
economics, said, “The Student
Government is inefﬁcient and
nasty. The only thing I look forward
to is :1 Homecoming concert and I
didn’t get any this year.
shafted.” '

Brad Edelman , senior psychology
and economics major, commented
“There deﬁnitely wasn’t enough for
Homecoming, especially this big
year with Pitt number one and
everyone ﬂying high. Except the
bonﬁre, that was pretty good.”

, Most commuters, who comprised
about 25% of the students
questioned, felt they were not

. beneﬁtting from the $12 fee, and a

few‘ admitted they were unaware of
the fee’s purpose. '

I feel _

“I’m not complaining, but ' P

commuters get the short end,”'
freshman Matt Rind said. ‘‘Every- ‘
thing’s scheduled at night. But’
there’s really nothing you can do

about it since everyone has class ‘
during the day.” ‘ ‘

Charles Kﬁatz;«’;senior economics
major, commented, “Since com--
'muters are -tied to their communi-
ties, they come to the University
and stay only for.a while. It’s hard
to get an organization formed
because commuters aren’t around
enough to get involved. I don’t

think the $12 is serving commu- 

ters.”

And what if the fee was raised?

“The price of ' college is high
enough,” sophomore advertising
major Craig Lindstrom said. “Now
we have to pay that mandatory
health fee. To me, the $12 is a good
price.”

Jo Ann Frangone, a senior in
business education said, “I would
resent an increase. What would we
get? Certainly not diversiﬁed
programs—they’d probably appeal
only to the rock concert element or
similar types.” ' .

Sophomore Linda Krivosh said,
“I wouldn’t resent an increase, but_
my mother would.”

Despite the overwhelming major- .

ity speaking against an increase in

JEFF LEAF

student activity fee, one student,
who refused to identify himself,
called for a boost in funding.
“Make the students pay $40
eac ,” the student said. “If we
have to ﬁght the Administration and
stop tution hikes, we need money
behind us, and that’s one thing
Student Government lacks. We
don't have enough money, to bribe
legislators to lobby for us.”

Revolutions of the most dan-
gerous kind often start in the
dustiest corners. Take for instance
recent suggestions in some legal
circles that the concept of a
ﬁctional person (the one that now
bolsters the existence of every
major corporation in the world( be
applied to certain natural objects:
forests, lakes, deserts, and national
parks. - '

Through this ingenious bit of
‘legality, the Monongahela River,
for instance, would be able to sue a
steel company for dumping chemis-
try into it. If the river won,
damages taken-from the offending

corporation (another ﬁctional en-’
tity) would be applied. directly to.

the Mon for correcting its
problems.

Schenley Park could sue,
through the same technique, the
City of Pittsburgh for non-support.
Yellowstone could" sue the govern-
ment for allowing too many tourists
to come in and muck up the place.

Fields and streams could sue the

state for allowing strip mining.

Bald Eagles could sue trigger
happy farmers for assault and
battery. By a species of ‘class

action, all things great and small
_ could sue corporations, nations and

individuals for generally fouling
things up.

Right nowit all seems very clear.

Right now it all seems very

clever. The stuﬂ’ that whimsical

The ﬁrst reaction on hearing
such ideas (and they are danger-

' The problem with this view is
that so many‘-hundreds of years
ago, the‘ same argument and
snickers could be applied to the

- idea of enabling corporations to

exist as ﬁctional people in the eyes
of the law.

In fact, once the sniggers died
down, and theilaw was enacted,
corporations ﬂourished. We live
with. the results now. A world
totally transformed-, a world where
legally there are giants and ants,
corporations and individuals. A

“ world where the only power the

United States government nom-
inally retains is that of military
monopoly.

Because of those dusty statutes,
corporations now make their own
diplomacy, their own “national”
rules, and their own power. Right
now IBM, a mere ﬁctional entity,
can master more legal power than
the very government of this
country. .

 Chatham College, and certain
ifthings that happened in that house
 on_Halloween Eve.

‘graveyard. So this year he insisted

,-his ghost that supposedly roams

night. »

. Equipped with sleeping bags,
‘ﬂashlight, and some Copenhagen
isnuff (to calm the nerves), Matt and
. I trudged up to the massive door and
rang the doorbell. _ We were‘
accompanied by Chas, my faithful
photographer (and part—time con-
spirator). .

WA ﬂock of coeds came to the
door. They knew about my devious
plan, and did their best to play along
with it. “Come on in," a cute blond
:with a New England accent said.
You must be the guys who are

going to sleep in the cellar tonight."
“We ‘stepped into the dining

quarters, and an ancient attic
cluttered with primitive ﬁre extin-

"Don’t you think these girls are
getting carried away," Chas
whispered after an hour of touring.
He‘ was right. We had some

i spooking to do.

We made a final stop at the ﬁrst
floor landing to stare at the

_ forbidding oil paintings of Todd
and his parents which lined the
stairwell, and headed for the
basement.

thing. 'Ihere’s a ghost in here.
Please don't provoke him.”

The cellar was a maze of 15 or 20
rooms—some locked for years,
some the resting places for the
-millionaire’s old fumiture.

We were to stay in an old storage
room at the end of the darkened‘
marble corridor.

Discarded rubble was scattered
on the ﬂoor. ,

“I wonder where this leads to,”

- Chas said, pulling at an old folding

door in the far corner of the room.
The door had no handle, but he
jiggled at the lock until it creaked
open.

“My God—it’s an old bowling
alley." We all stepped into the

cob-web-covered room, and shone
our flashlights around.
Matt didn’t know Chas and I had

    

been there earlier in the day,
making some preparations.

THE HAUNTED
BOWLINGALLEY

It was like something out of an
Alfred Hitchcock movie. TWO Old
wooden lanes stretched down into
the darkness, with _a thick oaken .
bench, resembling a pew in a Gothic
Cathedral, ‘lining the wall nearest‘
us.

Chas took a few quick‘ pictures,
shook our hands, and headed for the
door. “Good luck gentlemen," he
said with a grin. “If you have your
hearts set on seeing a ghost, this
looks like the right place.”_ He
slammed the door behind him.

We scouted-out the room from
top to bottom. “I can’t believe this
place," Matt said, sitting on the
long bench. “Looks like nobody’s
been in here for years."

Time for surprise number one. I
casually played the ﬂashlight along
the bench for a few minutes, until
Matt spotted one of the hinges.

“Holy...these benches open,"
Matt said in disbelief. He carefully
opened the ﬁrst hatch. It was ﬁlled
with hats; old, musty, decaying
hats, fashioned for a period of time
that was long gone.

"Unbelievable. These must have
belonged to Todd's mother." He
moved to the next section and
ﬂipped open the lid. More hats.
Matt poked through all of them,
mumbling and ‘muttering.

“There’s still one more com-‘*4

partment,” ‘he said, shining-the
ﬂashlightV_on_”_the fat-,_end of "the '

  

   
  
  
  

.’....;'.,..‘..'..'..».-

Matt threw openthe last hatch,
rustled around in the hats for a
second and suddenly froze in terror.
His shaking hand trained the beam
of light directly on the object in the
corner of the bench.

“Oh my God," he screamed, and
slammed it fshut. ' .THAT’S A
HUMAN SKULL.”

We ran out of the bowling alley,
and into the storage room. A sick,

putrid odor ﬁlled our nostrils.
“What’s that foul smell," I yelled,
covering my mouth.

Matt threw open the door and ﬂed
down the corridor to thevsafety of a
light and a Pepsi machine. I was
right behind him. v

“We're going upstairs to call the
police," he said, his voice shaking.

‘ ‘That skull shouldn't be there. And
that smell—what was it?"

So for a half an hour we sat there.
Matt chain-smok;:d.,cigarettes, and,I,,
begged him nottti  T 
stay in the house‘-by calling the“
police.

In the closet behind us, my
accomplice, Kambo,» sat motion-
less. He passed his time by ﬁddling
with the half-empty vial of
liquid—one of the foulest-smelling

jchemicals ever whipped up in a

chemistry lab. All was going as
planned. _q I i
“As long as we don’t bother
anything, nothing’s going to bother
us,”»I kept assuring Matt. He
ﬁnally agreed, reluctantly, to go
back_ to the bowling alley.

Keepingfar away from the _skull’s

,_ y/

 

resting place, we traipsed down the
cracked bowling lanes to a spot big
enough for both our sleeping ‘bags.
I climbed under my covers,
yawned, and lay back on theocold
wood ﬂoor. It was raining outside,
and a steady stream of water
pounded at the basement window.
Thesound was almost soothing. I
started to doze off. '

“You aren't going‘ to sleep are '

you?” Matt was sitting up, looking

suspiciously into the darkness.
“Huh—what? Oh. No,” I_.

grumbled, and rolled over.

“Wait.  you hear some-
thing?"
"Nothing but the rain.”

“Wait. Listen.” -
A soft, eerie organ music ﬂoated
into the bowling alley. It only lasted

' for a few seconds.

“Did you hear that?”
asked.

“Sounded like music—weird
music," I answered, silently
commending Kambo on another job
well done. _

Matt was on edge for another half
hour. “What time is it?” ‘

I looked at my watch. “It’s after
midnight." .

As the rain pounded and thewind
whipped through the trees outside,
our eyelids got heavier and heavier.

We streaked out of the bowling

took a quick look into the corridor
and slammed the door shut.

‘especially after a few shots of

whiskey, he could hardly be
mistaken for a ghost).

"I thought something like this -

nervously lighting a cigarette. “It

trying to sound serious.

“I just don't know,” he said, and

when he noticed it—a thin line cut
out in the wall. I couldn’t believe it.
We had stumbled upon a secret
door.

This was something I hadn't

planned on. I was anxious to try to
open the door. It might be a great
discovery- I started picking at the

the top of the stairs was a group of
females with shocked expressions
on their faces. One was crying.

“Okay. we want to know right
now. Who was that up in the
landing window?” They were dead
serious.

STRANGE HAPPENINGS

“What are you talking about,” ‘

I asked, totally amazed. They
pointed to an open window on the
ﬁrst floor landing, below the
portrait of Todd and his family.
"1 came walking down the stairs
just now, and thought I saw aface in

‘the window,” one of the girls

sobbed. “l was sure it was my
imagination. So I stopped and
stared at it for a few seconds.”

The girl stopped for a minute, on
the verge of tears. “There was a
face looking at me through that
open window. I saw it plain as day.
IT WAS TODD’S.

I had a lot of explaining to do,
fast. Iexplained to Matt that we had
spooked him. And then I tried to
explain to the girls that neither me
nor my friends had climbed 40 feet
from the driveway up to the landing
to stare in the window.

They wouldn’t believe me. Was I

gotten the better of him.

Whoever it was who had walked

“It must have just been our
nerves,” Matt began his dramatic
half-hour monologue (He thought
he was going to trick the people in
the wall). “We really didn’t see
anything-” .
He quietly grabbed an iron
dumbell hanging on a rack, and
waved it at the wall with a wicked
grin. He ‘ leaned over and

ing the dumbell‘ against hishand as
if _ he were smashing, someone’s

"I think we’ll just wait here until

loudly.
It was spectacularly funny. But I .

,wasn’t about to stand around until

sunrise, waiting to beat the brains
out of  people in the wall.

[ﬁnally convinced Matt that we
should leave and come back the next
day. We didn’t wantto get hurt, did

But they were. They told tales of

And of books ﬂying across the
rooms. ‘ -

‘ ‘Wait a minute, ’ ’ Mattbutted in.
“I still don’t know what's in that
secret door downstairs.”

‘ ‘What secret door,” they asked.
Nobody had ever noticed it before.

Linking arms, we all headed fo{
the basement. We weaved down
the stairs, through the marble

Matt used acoathanger to pry a
little square piece out of the wall. A

“It really does open,” I choked,

Goodbye

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

American hard rock bands have
always taken a backseatto their
counterparts across the Atlantic.
Now, group’s like Boston's Aero-
smith and New York’s Derringer,
are starting to change this radically.

The two groups appeared Wed-
-nesday night before a sell-out house
at the Civic Arena unleashing three
hours of modern American rock n’
roll to prove that the British don’t
have a patent on hard rock,
charisma, or energy.

‘The headliner, Aerosmith, is one

' of the hottest groups of the 70’s. In

the last three years they’ve sold

- over six million albums without the

beneﬁt of airplay and critical

acclaim. They've made it by word of

; mouth—getting up onstage night

after night, and winning fans on
sheer power of their live show.

.Unlike’Kiss, Aerosmith is not a
theatrical group. An occasional
ﬁreﬂash nere and there, but no 4th
of July extravaganza. They’re
"basically a no frills, kick-ass rock n’
roll band that’s not afraid to work up
a sweat.

Steven Tyler (looking like a cross
between Mick’ Jagger and Carly
Simon), is the ﬂashy, prancing

=_:-,; A H frontman-lead vocalist, but not the
i ~ -. [only star in this tight band.

 

J   siizdied-rower chums’--nd’xrindin:

 

 Dark-haired and sullen, lead .
  guitarists, Joe Perry and Brad"
 '- Whitford, are excellent heavy metal.

I  rockers. —~ 1 Their brutal English-

 

During intermission, Jay inform-
ed the audience that anyone who
was “uncomfortable” could leave.
Considering my obligation, (one of
my ﬁrm pagan beliefs,) I stayed to
relate the evening’s events. During
this time, cards and pencils were
passed out to collect addresses.

After the break, the subject of the

’ Bermuda Triangle was broached

and discarded as hokum. No
consideration was given to the
startlin, recently published ac-
counts 'of the strange recorded
messages from ﬂight pilots before
their planes vanished.

Jay performed his own version of
the triangle, stepping into a Kole
exclusive, three-sided contraption

_while eerie music" played.

Phosphorescent tubes, which ex-
tended from the end, burned bright
as strange waves generated from a
tuning fork device at the apex of the
triangle.

Jay folded himself inside the
structure. A little black door shut
him off from audience’s view. One
of the several attendants folded the
flaps with the tubes over, until they

a _closed in on the pyramid. When the

aide opened the door, the audience
saw only gleaming tubes criss-cros-
sed inside the triangular form. . Jay
had vanished. But later he
returned.

cataclysmic runs are the heart of the
band’s exciting. sound. Bassist Tom
Hamilton and drummer Joey
Kramer make up the simple, but
energized rhythm section that
propels this wrenching metal
machine. -

After seeing Aerosmith in concert
for the third time, it seems likely
that they will be the Stones of the
70’s.- Tyler, like Jagger, is
undoubtedly the ladies’ man, but
other band members are loaded
with personality and stage charis-
ma, too. Tyler seduces'the girls;
Perry, Whitford, Hamilton, and
Kramer win the boys with their
arrogance and punk swagger.
Aerosmith has presence.

But, presence aside, the band can
play some of the loudest, most
raucous rock n’ roll this site of a
buzzsaw. And with song titles such
as “Lord ofthe Thigh,” “Lick and a
Promise,” “Big 10 Inch_ Record”
and “Rats in the Cellar,” the effect
is slightly different than watching
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

Aerosmith has reached; the
pinnacle of rock n’ roll in less than
three years, and in the process, lent
encouragement and respectability
to other American hard rock groups.

No longer is it necessary to have an
English accent, a love for tea and
Elton John as your ,’ buddy;
Aerosmith is proving that you can

pay homage to your English idols,-V .
» but play’ modern music on you 

 -American terms.

 

” Tricks, Magic, And 

That was the - essence of the
'Bermuda,',I'riangle. A nice trick, but
it barely touched upon the mystery.

On this blessed of -nights, the

audience learned thatghosts do not ‘

exist, but devils and goblins do. (in
addition-tofangels of course). But
Jay didvnot describe their visible
tell-tale signs.

Finally, we learned the ﬁve of the
27 disasters predicted in the Old
Testament which tell of the end of
the world and the return of Jesus
Christ.. Jay, while sticking ﬁve
brass’ links together, gave accurate

‘ scientiﬁc data and Biblical accounts

of the increase in earthquakes,
famine, overpopulation and discord
in the Holy City.

Equatin g Jesus Christ with magic
and deception—let alone present-
ing them on the~same stage—is a
curious way of bringing him into
focus. Someone outside the
Judeo/ Christian traditions might
well believe Jesus is the work of evil
spirits, as evidenced by Andre Kole
and his world-roaming hooligans.

I am almost certain that, had
Jesus Christ viewed this spectacle
performed in his name, his holy
ashen face would have turned violet
with shame.

Jogger, Hello Tyler

Opening for Aerosmith, was
Derringer, a relatively new band
headed by ex—McCoy’s, Johnny
Winter Band’s, and the Edgar
Winter Group’s lead guitarist, the
tiny Rick Derringer.

Derringer‘ is another unasham-
edly American band weaned on the
likes of the Stones, Led Zeppelin,
and the Who. They play simple
hard rock-pop that is fresh and
infectious.

Derringer with rhythm guitarist/

vocalist Danny Johnson and bassist .

Kenny Aaronsen are a bubbly
bunch of guys with a zest for rock
n’roll. During “Sailor,” “Across
the Universe,” “Rock n’ Roll
Hoochie'Koo” and “Let Me In,”
the three of them bounced around
stage like little kids at Christmas,
while drummer Vinny Appice beat
the ‘sticks with asimuch gusto as his
legendary brother, Carmine.

Aerosmith and Derringer; ~two
Americanbands that are standing
up and being counted. Let’s hope
this current trend continues.

Derringer: ‘

    Rock Star

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

I don’t think I’ve ever met a more
friendly and outgoing rock person-
ality in my life than Rick Derringer.
The tiny, S’5” Derringer is an.
American hard rock guitarist who

I "absolutely bubbles with the enthus-

iasm of a high school boy. A radical
change from the typical big-headed
rock burnout.

“By nature I’m a pretty positive
person,” Derringer said, placing
his feet up on a chair backstage at
the Civic Arena. “And I don’t think
I’ve ever felt better about my music
or the band I’m in_ than now. I feel

« great.’ ’

/ Derringer appeared last Wed-
nesday night with” Aerosmith at the
Civic Arena. Both bands are
integral parts in the rejunvenation
of interest in American hard rock.

“The kind of music that English
bands create isn’t the same as most
American rock,” Derringer said.
“American rock has been mostly
exempliﬁed by the Southern bands
like the Allman Brothers, and two

‘guys I’ve worked with a lot in" the

past, Johnny and Edgar Winter.
“I think Aerosmith is oneof the
few bands that . is taking music
innovated by groups from Britain;
but they take it and put it into a
modern context. I think that’s the
kind of band Derringer is too.”
Derringer has one well-‘received
album to their- credit, and tourediit
the whole summer, trying to make a
name for themselves out on the
concert stage. .1 agree : with Rick

when he says it’s’ healthy for-

American bands to grow on their

’"""?,“_¥1_'.S;id_¢.8'~°e1a1¥§ .min,e.. vsr_exe- all just

      

believing/ You'll bet by/ Bad days
will hurry by”.

“A Thousand Conversations” is
a melancholy tune about a lost love
by a forlorn person, itc. etc.
Unfortunately John’s technique of
emotional catches in her voice gets
obnoxious after a while and this is
only the second cut on the album.
Also the La La La’s that substitute
for the end of the song.are too trite
to be swallowed by_ yours truly. I
just can’t see where an original,

the general public garbage such as
La La La’s and fade-outs for song
endings. How lazy can you get?

Some decent poetry was also
featured in the next song
“Compassionate Man” of which
the following is a sample: “Love,
my whole life was a desert/ Then
gently your love fell like rain/ We
lived for awhile in a. garden/ But

now I’m a desert again.” It’s very‘

land and the deep bass of Hursheye,

Wipginton whose last memorable
song was “Let Me Be There”. The
contrast between John’s breathy
high notes and Winginton’s gritty
bass forms a nice combination
which is best not overdone and
here it’s not.

‘The Nicest

I've Met"

“The heavier songs are heavier,
and the rockier songs are more
rockin,” Derringer beamed.”
American bands are playing
rock—now rock like Aerosmith-
more than ever before. There’s no
reason to sell-out, because what
we’re doing it good.”

‘Being a ten year veteran of the
music business, Derringer is
amazed by the success of his

. headlining friends, Aerosmith.

And quite frankly, so am I.

‘ ‘I think they owe their success to
just building an audience,” Derrin-
ger said taking a small-, sip of
Heinekin. “You start ‘doing

it

it

something, and you try to do a good .

job. I know these guys: I toured
with them all summer, they work
hard.
' “They’re a band whose, individ-
ual members might ‘not be the
ﬂashiest soloist on his instrument or
whatever, but ‘you put them all
together and they become an
unbelievably strong band. And
there’s not too many like that left.
Since he left the McCoys in the
late 60’s, Derringer’s name has
been synonomous with the Winter
brothers. Edgar and Johnny. He
played in groups headed by them,
produced their albums, becoming
a close and integral member of their
musical family. A But Derringer

decided to leave the Winters’ /

shadow, to make it on his own.
“Edgar’s last band, the Edgar

Winter Group, got to the point

where it wasn't working live that

-much,”-Derringer said, ‘ ‘and in the

studio, ~gEdga'r’s ideas’, Dan. Hart-

easier than what it’s going to take
to keep it when the ﬁnal balloting
arrives after the bowl games.

Johnny Majors continually states,
the Panthers (9-0) are not looking
that far ahead and are taking each
game one at a time. lt’s certainly a
wise game plan, what with
arch-rivals West Virginia (Saturday
at Pitt Stadium, 12:50 p.m. kickoff)
and Penn State waiting to pull an
upset, just as Purdue did to rival
Michigan last week.

Though West Virginia is 4-5 after
pulling out a last-minute 32-28 win
over Tulane last Saturday in the
Superdome, the Mountaineers

"might just as , well also be
9-O--records don’t really matter in

such a rivalry. And the Panthers V

remember every vivid detail of last
year’s stunning 17-14 loss down in
Morgantown, when placekicker Bill
McKenzie’s 37-yard ﬁeld goal at
the buzzer embarrassed Pitt on an

I ' ABC regional telecast.

“I think we've got a lot of

Wilson photo

reasons to get ready this week--not 4

just to pay back,” Majors said.
“We’ve got to get ready because
we’ve‘ got an objective in mind--
that's to remain number one and to
play like a championship football
team should play. '

“You have to learn how to win,”
he continued, “and you have to
learn how to play like champions.
Our team has been through a lot in
three and a half years or sojand
we’re still a hungry team. This
team hopefully will not lose, but,
if it does, I don’t think it will be
because of overconﬁdence. We
have no reason to be overconﬁdent
Saturday, because that team
(WVU) beat us last year.’-’

The Panthers are favored by at
least three touchdowns over the
Mountaineers, but it will take more
than the wisdom of Jimmy the
Greek to carry Pitt to its tenth win
without a loss. It will take the
outstanding play which has been
carrying the team all along--the
running of Tony Dorsett andlﬂthe
blocking, tackl
blocking, tackling, intercepting,
kicking’ and punting which have
paved thé"way for College football’s
all-time leading runner. . ‘

At last count, Dorsett had 1,525
yards for the season (5.8 per carry)

 

 

and 16 touchdowns rushing. For
his career, he has gained 5,659
yards--or 341 yards from the
never-before-reached 6,000 yard
plateau. If Dorsett gets 356 yards
in the next two games, he will also
pass the single season‘ rushing
mark of 1,88,l'."yards set by, Ed
Marinaro of Cornell in 19'/"1r.__"'
With n’1’_i,1_e'f'NCAA ‘records

already, Dorsett can also reach '

Archie Grifﬁnfs’ records of "most
100-yard games in a season (11)
and a career (33), Marinaro’s mark
of most 200-yard games in a season
(ﬁve) and career (ten), Steve
Owens’ record of touchdowns
rushing in a career (56), and Army
great Glenn Davis’ record of 59
career touchdowns and 354 total
points.

Dorsett currently has scored 54
touchdowns overall, 50 of them
rushing for 326 career points. It’s
almost appalling what Dorsett, who
also holds 27 ‘Pitt records, has
done.  ’

“Dorsett ’ is in a class by
himself,” - agrees Mountaineer
coach Frank-Cignetti. “He can
completely dominate a game or
break it open any time. He is the
best running back in America.

BYJIMLEWIS
True or false: the Pitt soccer

I team will host Penn State tonight at

in Pitt Stadium.
' Answer: none of the above.
4.: Confused? Actually, things ‘were

a bit confused around Pitt coach-

Leo Bemis’ ofﬁce yesterday as to
whether or not the Panther Nittany
Lion soccer match would be held.

You see, the wondrous weather-
men predicted heavy snows for
tomorrow night, snows that would
have altered the playing surface in
Pitt Stadium for football Saturday if
two soccer teams trampled on it the

’ night before.

“You don ’t want to mat the snow
down, or you will pack it into ice
.and it won’t be able to melt in time

8' for Saturday’s football game,”

Bemis said. “But if you leave the
‘snow alone it can be. swept off.

- This canhappen on-any turf.”

But now, -things are looking

_ sunnier for Pitt's ﬁnal match of the-
 year to ‘go on “as scheduled:

getting a heavy snow," C|1mmin5'

explained. “At one stage, we were

hearing talk of four to six inches.
Right now, we’re not anticipating
any problem. The only thing that

» would put a crimp in the game is
heavy snow.”

So for all intents and purposes, it
looks like the game is still on. -
However, one wonders if that is a
blessing or a curse.

Penn State (6-3-0) is ranked third
in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-
Delaware Conference and already
has accepted a bid to the NCAA

playoffs in Philadelphia, where the 1

Lions will meet Philadelphia
Textile Monday afternoon. ‘ At one
time, they were ranked number-
one, until losses to Temple (2-1),
Hartwicke, and Navy dropped them
a bit.’

’ “They have good talent,” Bemis
admired. “Everybody still recog-
nizes them as a tough team. _
They’re _good and that's it.” '

Pitt, jomeanwhile, has 8 lost four 8'
' . .-gam;es/,in,a row (the last three_ were

   
     
  

to last year’s (S-7-2). But that
would be quite an accomplishment,
considering that this year’s team is
one of the youngest in the country.

Boasting only three seniors on _
-the .entire roster (Kim Blasko,

Mark Gannon, and Tom Murphy),
the Panthers have shown promise.

Three freshmen (Karl Nigh, Rick _

Roccon, and Todd Wawrousek)
have cracked the starting lineup,
not to mention a. slew of
sophomores that are too plentiful to
count. .

And who knows, a victory
against powerful Penn State could
set the ball rolling for the situation
between these two clubs to turn
someday—history - has repeated
itself.

“When we were in the NCAA.
playoffs back in 1965,” Bemis
reminisced, “we had a game
scheduled for a Saturday up at
Penn State that was postponed and
couldn’t be rescheduled. ‘I guess

" -  you! could say. this is tit for ta.”

keeps it up. Kendra completed
seven of 12 passes for 96 yards in
last year’s WVU win. His only bad
point is in the interception category
where he has thrown 17.

“I’m very much impressed with
their running, expecially Kendra,”
Majors said. “He is a very
quick-handed operator. He has
quickness and will take advantage
of the run when he has it. He also
has a great passing ability.”

Kendra’s favorite target is junior
split end Steve Lewis, who has
pulled down 36 passes so far for
604 yards. The bulk of the running
is handled by fullback Paul Lumley,
a native of Butler, Pa., who has
rushed for 493 yards and three

touchdowns. He had his best day 7

last week against Tulane with 122
yards and two touchdowns.
Lumley, however, is “question-

_“‘We’ve made a lot of errors
offensively,” Cignetti admitted.
“Most of them have come trying to
play catch up football. We’re a
young football team and we’re
getting better.

“Playing Pitt is a tremendous
challenge and opportunity for us.
But we’ll be going up against a
great football team and out-
standing personnel. You don't get
to play number one every day.”

And for the Panthers, who don’t
get to be number one everyday
(and haven’t been so since 1937),
West Virginia, along with Penn
State on Nov. 26, will also be a
challenge and a chance to prove

their number-one ranking is no
ﬂuke.

GRID NOTES: Majors quipped

at Tuesday's luncheon that he’

“might even send Purdue a
Christmas card" for upsetting
previously top-ranked Michigan
last Saturday...The Mountaineers
have only six seniors playing to any

Harriers’ Fall Season:
What Went Wrong?

_ BY DAVE McDONALD

With the Pitt football team playing its best season in history and the

basketball team preparing for a_ similarly good year, a question still
‘remains in the minds of many coaches,’ runners,- and fans about this
year’s Panther cross-country team—what went wrong?

How could a team, that was undefeated in dual meets and won every
invitational in which they ran the previous year, suddenly turn sour with
a 2-3 dual meet record and dismal ﬁnishes at big meets? .

How could a team that lost only one man out of the top seven develop a

losing season?

The head coach was the same, the workouts were similar, the air was
the same as was the weather, the personnel on the team was like last
year’s, but yet something happened. The team just wasn’t the same. It

wasn’t a -winner. 1 .

The pre—season Panthers had high hopes of going to the NCAA’s, but
along came Allegheny Community College to knock them oﬁ at the Cal
S tate Invitational in "mid-September. V The Panthers regained their
hopes for the NCAA’s and ran -over a weak West Virginia squad. -

Looking toward the Nationals, Pitt was smashed by good team efforts
from Kentucky and Ohio State in October and, weeks later,  a poor‘ _ —
showing at the Central Collegiates at Kent State. By that time the hopes
for an NCAA bid were extinguished. To make things worse Penn State
rubbed it in with a 19-38 win over the excuseless Panthers. _

Where did they go wrong? ‘Did the teams the Panthers face suddenly
improve drastically? Did every team beside Pitt improve their training
programs and recruit foreign athletes? No, all the other teams were
basically the same. No team was unbeatable.

~ Bob Lee, a sophomore, who was injured for the majority of the season,
has some time to sit back and take a go\od look atthe team and offered his

impression.

“Our workouts were mostly centered around team leader Mel Boyd.
Since our traiing was centeredilaround Mel, the beneﬁtted the mo_st,
while the other runners on the team di_dn’t.”

Lee theorized that all runners are

As The Saying Goes. . .

' so quick. so it gives us a better

BY STEVE SYBERT

Pitt cornerback LeRoy F elder has
his own version of the old football
cliche, “The best offense is a good
defense.”

“The offense draws the crowds,
the defense wins the games,” says
the 5-11, 185-pound junior from
Baltimore, Md. . _‘.‘I think that’s
true." _  .

So far, in 1976-, that has been
very true. On many occasions, the

Panther defense has come through ’

with key interceptions, fumble
recoveries or tackles which have
turned the ball over to the offense

Aﬁin excellent ﬁeld position.

From there, the offense has
taken control and vaulted the
Panthers to among the top ﬁve
teams in the nation in scoring. It is
this togetherness and understand-
ing between the offense and
defense which has enabled Pitt to
achieve" its undefeated (9-0) record
and current number one ranking.

-‘-‘They (the offensive_ players)
feel good about us getting the ball
for them in good ﬁeld position,”
Felder said. “We’re making it
easier for them. They’d much
rather drive 30 yards than 90
yards.”

Though the entire Panther
defensive unit is among the ﬁnest
in the country, much has been said
in particular about Felder and his
three partners—Safety Bob Jury,
Monsterback Jeff Delaney and Left
cornerback J .C. Wilson—in" the
defensive backﬁeld, which has
already pulledjdown 19 intercep-

M "tions on the year.

Stadium, living up to remarks by
Cadet Coach Homer Smith who
saidof Pitt, “My gosh, some of
their defensive backs are ready to
start in the pro league by our
estimation.’ ’ ~

Independence

Felder feels it is the cohesive-
ness of the defensive backﬁeld
which has made it so successful
this season.

“I think we worked good as‘_a

‘unit because now we’ve played a

whole year together and we’re
beginning to feel for each other,
know each other, and just react to
each other well.’ That's our biggest

. asset-7;reaction, and being in the

right place at the right time.”
Felder, who was named the
winner of the Ed Conway Memorial
Award as the most improved player
during Pitt’s spring football drills
back in April, saw action in every
game as a sophomore and started
in half of them. He registered 26
tackles and intercepted two passes,
one in the end zone versus Duke to
stop an important Blue Devil drive
in the Panthers’ 14-0 win.
“LeRoy’s progress has been
most pleasing,-” Head Coach
Johnny Majors said. “He made
great progress last year and seems

. to have matured into a fine overall
defensive performer.”

Besides his ﬁve interceptions so

far in the 1976 season, Felder has L‘

compiled 25 tackles already from
his right defensive halfback slot
and has recovered a number of
fumbles, including one'last Satur-
day against Army.

“This year, I think I've been
having a really good -year,” Felder
said, f‘Mainly because I’ve been

healthy this year; whereas last‘

year, I got a lot of minor injuries._
But being healthy is the main thing
that's helped me:” ' __
Felder, who is known as the
hardest hitter in the Pitt ‘secondary,
attributes much of the success of
the defensive backs_to the linemen
and linebackers—-the men‘ up front
“who-make our job easy.’ _
“They get the big pass rush all
the time,” Felder said. “They’re
applying the pressure on the
quarterback_and he has to release

beginning of the season-' was that they were playing with. false
conﬁdence———which made them play independently instead of like a

team. *

Pitt’s cross-country team ran into the same problem. _.Instead of
running like ateam, they ran independently of each other; therefore not
beneﬁtting from good team running as did Ohio State, Kentucky and 1

Penn State. :

Just because they went to the NCAA’s the yearbefore didn’t mean
they were going this year. The Steelers ﬁnally realized they weren't
going to the Super Bowl for the third time because they did the previous
two years. Now they play each game one at a time and are winning in
style. (Though it may be too late now for the Steelers). .

The Panthers‘ also found out too late in the season that if you want to go
to the NCAA’s you have to start at the bottom and work up. The more

you win the harder you are to stop.

If the team leames iiom its mistakes, possibly by running more
distance, holding different workouts for different runners, running each
meet at a time, and with the NCAA’s in the back of their mind instead of
the front, the National Championships will be a reality for the team,
instead of for just Boyd.

left tackle’s vibrant personality has
ﬁgured into the number-one ranekd
Panthers’ plans as much as any of
the other factors mentioned, if not
moreso in defensive line coach ‘Jim

To Dyar, the 6-3, 248-pound
Parrish is the epitome of Pitt
football this year for reasons other
than his more noticeable attributes
of size, speed, strength, quickness,
and intelligence. \

“His biggest contribution has
been his attitude in general,” Dyar
explained exuberantly. “Every

joker and I gotta admit, he may be
the best joker in the world. ‘

“He is so typical of this football

compassion for his teammates. He
loves what he’s doing. Without

At least last Saturday it wouldn’t , _-

have been. Nothing that transpired? ‘ L I L
_ along‘ the Pitt bench last Saturday '

could have quite matched Parrish’s

reaction to the news that previously I‘ ' I".
number-one ranked Michigan had  

been defeated.

The scene when the news was .
announced at last weekend’s Pitt
game was evidence of Parrish’s
boyishness. . ~

Arms upraised, helmet in padded 7 7

up and down for a few minutes"
before coming “down to earth” to

_ hug teammates. ,

“It’s like an early Christmas " 

gift," Parrish said in reference to
the number-one ranking. , I
One Saturday, however, does not 1

a fun-loving football player make, at
least" not in Parrish’s case.
Although last Saturday’s jubilation

brought the little boy out of most of  I

the Panthers, ‘according to Dyar

jubilation is a day-to-day thing in

the life of Parrish. .
“He loves what he’s doing,”

/Dyar stated. “He enjoys what‘he’s

doing. He tries his best. Most
importantly, he does his job -well."
Indeed he does. To date, the
