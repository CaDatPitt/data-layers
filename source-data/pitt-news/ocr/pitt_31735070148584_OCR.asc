John Eshenbach sits atthe bar, intense-
ly gripping his Miller  Life as he
watches Pitt’s homecoming game on
Saturday afternoon. He’s been”com—
ingto Primanti Bros. restaurant nearly
everyweek since heﬁrstvisited in1994
on a middle school ﬁeld trip. A 2008
Pitt graduate, Eshenbach returned to
the Oakland location for homecoming
festivities and ﬁne manly dining.

The Primanti Brothers’ almost-
famous restaurant has become quite
famous over the past few years, and
has recentlybeenvoted“Manliest Res-
taurantinthe Mid—Atlantic Region” by
readers of Men’s Health magazine.

In March, the magazine asked

readers to nominate the manliest res- .

taurant in the country, using criteria
such as portion size, protein content,
cocktail and beer choices and overall
manly dining experience to narrow
down the top nine most-manly res-
taurants in the U.S.

Paul Kita, associate editor ofMen’s
Health and founder of the magazine’s
Guy Gourmetblog, said that the maga-
zine purposely did not deﬁne what a
manly restaurant should be,

“We got thousands of responses
with a large variety of deﬁnitions of
what a manly restaurant is. We asked
ourselves, were these places we would
goto or we would recommend to our
ﬁiends? Then we turned the voting

back to the readers,” he said.
Primanti Bros. was ranked one of
the manliest restaurants  the nation
for its sandwiches, which can come
with their side dishes stuffed inside
them. .AJuly article by Men’s Health
magazine calledtherestauranfs iconic
dish a “bicep -buster of a sandwic .”
“It’s mostly chicks thatrun this .
store,” said -Meghan Powell, one of
two female managers at the manliest
restaurant inthe Mid—Atlantic. “We’re
considered a ‘manly’ place because

"we have the biggest sandwiches in

Oakland. I mean, we’ve  been
prettyfamous.We’re deﬁnitelyatoutist
stop for anyone that comes into Pitts-
burgh-” .

A typical Primanti Bros. sandwich

is stacked with sliced meat, cheese,

french fries, coleslaw and «tomato,
Which all comes slapped between two
pieces of fresh Italian bread.

Powell hustled around behind the
counter on Friday as she handled the
cash register andtook orders from the
swarm of customers before shouting
the one-word selections to the cooks.

“You have to be able to handle an
intense work environment,” she said.

Out of the top nine nominees, one
will receive a national title designating
itthe manliest restaurant. Theﬁnalde—
cisionwillbe announcedinthe Decem-
ber 2011 issue of Men’s Health, which
will be out on newsstands Nov. 22.

turned into a paying job that would
be the start of her career.

“I certainly\didn’t know at 19

that I wanted to be a journalist. But
now, I couldn’t see myself doing
anything else,” Morris said.

To get an internship, Morris said
that an applicant must act “conﬁ-
dent, but not cocky,” -show that he
or she is willing to learniwithout
appearing inexperienced and, of
course, know how to spell.

Morris said that in her experi-

Marcus said that students who are seek-

company they wish to work for and then tailor -

their resume, portfolioand cover letter to
speciﬁcally address that company.

“I think students tend to be passive. You
can’t sit around and wait for things to come
to you,” Marcus said about the way students
should act once they attain an internship.
“Come up with ideas to present to people. It
mightmzean working extra hours or coming
in early to show thatlyou are energetic.”

The importance of the internship experi-
ence was echoed by Cindy Skrzycki, a profes-
sor in the English writing department. She
said that experience is key for students who
wish to succeed in the media world. Students
should aim to work at multiple internships
and take advantage of the many opportunities
on campus to gain professional experience.

As for tonight’s event, Skrzycki recom-
mended that students attending the discus-
sion stay for the entire program, ask any
questions they might have during the Q—and-A
segment and bring a resume and cover letter
if they are actively seeking an internship.

“Look around and ﬁnd as much informa-
tion as you can, and then follow up,” she said.
“[Don’t] leave early and miss the opportunity
to meet someone.”

Hinton, a former columnist and managing
editor at The Pitt News, also moved from an
internship to a paid, permanent position.
After completing school, Hinton landed an
internship at Talking Points Memo, a web-
based political news organization, as a vid-
eo—editing intern. Two months later, he was
hired as a tech fellow before being hired as a

' full-time programmer for Talking Points in

November 2010. - ‘
This September, Hinton left the Memo
to take his current position at The New York

Times. He said that there is more to getting an ‘

internship than just having a nice portfolio,
and he plans to elaborate on this tip during
the discussion tonight.

“Good clips are incredibly important —
and that’s how you are going to get a job,”
Hinton said. “But there are tons of people
who are great writers and there are tons of
people who have worked harder and longer
than you have. What will set you apart is be-
ing interesting.” I

Pitt should offer
LGBTQ housing  
accommodations

It’s one thing to come out to family,
friends and peers. But What about
declaring your sexual orientation
on college applications?

’ Elmhurst College recently be-
came the ﬁrst university in the na-
tion to ask its applicants about their
sexual orientations. The idea is that
assessing the size of a school’s LG-
BTQ population could help admin-
istrators better ﬁt their students’
needs, which could include ﬁnding
tolerant roommates and providing
appropriate health-care.

But we think it’s a practice that’s

not exactly fair.

 after surveying its stu-
dent‘bo‘clj‘r;i‘a.s(.fhool found that only
1 percent of its students reported

being LGBTQ? Of course, that per- A

centage’s accuracy ‘wouldn’t be
precise, but a school could see that
number and cut back funding for re-
sources such as LGBTQ-specialized
counseling. And those cuts might
not necessarily be in the student
population’s best interest.

Although Pitt is a large school,
the exact size of its LGBTQ popula-
tion isn’t very clear. Fortunately,
the Student Health Service offers
specialized services and nondis-
criminatory health care. It could
improve its housing accommoda-
tions, though, by employing an
Elmhurst—esque survey of students’
preferences.

But instead of adopting an ap-
plication questioning policy like
Elmhurst, Pitt could survey en-
rolled students on their housing
applications. ‘

By waiting until a student en-
rolls in a particular university to ask
his or her orientation, schools can
avoid any discrimination or affir-

. mative action-like decisions. With

orientation questions on applica-
tions, admissions oflicials would be
able to use a prospective student’s
sexual orientation to further diver-
sify a campus or decline him or her
because of it, whether consciously
or subconsciously.

We don’t think sexual orienta-
tion should have any bearing on
a student’s admission to a univer-

sity.

When it comes to housing choic-
es, though, discrimination and fear
are far different from roommates
simply not getting along. Polling
students on their sexuality, toler-

ance and gender preferences could

allow"Pitt to house students in

- places that are a better ﬁt for their

lifestyles and preferences. It’s all
about comfort and happiness, and
if a college doesn’t meet students’
needs to the best of its ability, it
should undertake more effective
procedures.

-For example, transgendered
students might not know exactly
where they standlon the gender
continuum, but they should be
able to choose to’live where they
feel comfortable and free from ha-
rassment. '

Because students can’t exactly

choose where they live at Pitt, a less- .

effective way of handling housing
issues is to wait and see if a problem
arises and then allow a roommate
switch, if necessary. _

In former Rutgers student Tyler
Clementi’s case, the way his room-
mate and ﬂoormate treated him
drove him to suicide — all because
he was gay.

We think universities across the
nation should see this unfortunate
event as a sign that they must ac-
commodate members of the LGBTQ
community. Too many tragedies in-
volving bullying are preventable.

We think sexual orientation
does not directly correlate to how
well a student can function under
certain living conditions, but there
are still prejudiced and judgmental
people who mightijlae unwelcoming
or uncomfortableivvith certain liv-
ing arrangements; —

Perhaps withﬁiew roommate-
matching system,;i;_1>itt could do its
best to prevent bullying and provide
the most comfortable experience
possible for its students.

Sexual orientation is part of a
person’s character, just like race,
religion or gender. Isn’t it time for
colleges to start catering to students
as distinguishable people? .

GOING MENTAL

Getting Help Part 3.5:

Debunking meds myths

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

I would be utterly remiss if I wrote
about psychiatric_ medication with-
out any mention of myths or side
effects. I’m not a doctor, but I am
someone who has had experiences
with depression and antidepres-
sants and consulted with my psy-
chiatrist about them. Distinguishing
fact from myth when it comes to
meds can make all the difference
between recovery and stagnation.
Here are some things that are

not true about antidepressants. First ‘

of all, they are not a miracle cure.
You will not feel better the day you
pop your ﬁrst pill. You might not
ever feel better on the ﬁrst type of
pill you take, and you might have to
try another one after a few weeks.
Even if the ﬁrst drug you try works
with your body chemistry, you likely
won’t perceive a noticeable differ-
ence for about a month.

Furthermore, meds are no sub-
stitute for therapy, self care and re-
ﬂection. Your antidepressants might
make living feel more bearable, but
they won’t give you self-esteem. Your
anxiety meds might quell your panic
attacks, but they won’t magically
transform you into someone who
feels OK in situations involving large
crowds. Those are things that often
-take months or years of work. My
life didn’t become as good as it is
now after just a few weeks on Paxil.
But I’m not sure Iwould have worked
so hard for those years if Paxil hadn’t
brought a reprieve from the periodic
two-week episodes during which it
was a superhuman struggle to stop
crying and leave my dorm.

On the ﬂip side, your medica-
tion is not going to wipe out your
personality. You will not talk, think
and act like a Stepford Wife or a Care
Bear, and it will not make your life
an endless expanse of sunshine. If
your meds are working, you will be a
happier, more-‘capable, less-anxious
version of yourself. In fact, one sure
sign that your meds are working is
friends remarking that you actually
seem more like yourself. You will
still feel sad when it is appropriate

to feel sad, and sometimes when
it’s not. You will still, in short, be
human; and you will still be you.

Meds also won’t quash your cre-
ativity or your spirit of rebellion. It’s
true that manygreat artists, writers
and musicians struggle with mental
illness, but even though creativity
and mental health troubles often
coincide, treating one won’t remove
the other. I’m a writer -— a nonﬁc-
tion writer by occupation, a ﬁction
writer by nature and ‘a poet by ill-
advised foray into the genre — and
I’ve never felt less creative as a result
of my medication. _

Never has it been suggested to
me since beginning treatment that
the quality or originality of my work
has declined. You can, in fact, have
your poetry cake and eat it too with-
out putting your head in the’ oven
like Sylvia Plath.

The number-one legitimate rea-
son that some people decide against
medication is because of side ef-
fects. Side effects of antidepres-
sants vary widely in severity and
character, but the most common
ones include headaches, nausea or
vomiting, insomnia or hypersom-
nia, vivid dreams and weight gain.
Sometimes the side effects subside
after the adjustment period —- the

« time it takes your body to get used

to processing the drug -— but some-
times they persist, and many people
ﬁnd them disruptive enough to dis-
continue usage of the drug. On the
other hand, many people experience
a withdrawal syndrome when they
begin to wean themselves off their
antidepressants. Thesyndrome can
manifest in ﬂu-like symptoms, trem-
ors, sleep disturbances and a multi-
tude of other aggravations. Usually
these symptoms fade a few days or
weeks after withdrawal is complete,

‘but on rare occasions‘ they can last

for months. This dissuades many
people — very understandably —
from taking antidepressants in the
ﬁrst place. L ‘
Some of the most common side
effects of psychiatric medication are
sexual. Consumers of most major
brands of antidepressants frequent-
ly report loss of libido, problems
with erection or lubrication and

difﬁculty reachin orgasm. Many
people suffer these effects for far too
long because they’re embarrassed
to call their psychiatrists and say,
“Since taking this medication I can’t
reach orgasm, and that’s unaccept-
able.” This is BS..If your medication

is having sexual side effects that are , ‘

affecting your quality of life, get over
your shyness and tell your doctor.
You deserve to enjoy your sex, life
just as much’ as you deserve to be
healthy and happy.

Most antidepressants carry la-
bels advising users not to consume
alcohol while taking them. These
warnings vary by brand --— and you
should always ask your doctor —
but usually such labels just. mean
that you will get drunker faster than
before you started taking meds.
They don’t necessarily mean you
will get horribly sick. If you‘ could
usually have two beers and be ﬁne,
this will likely be out of the question

‘after you start taking antidepres-
sants. Be cognizant of this, and limit
your intake accordingly. '

Thoughts of suicide are another
commonly reported side effect of
psychiatric medication. This should
go without saying, but for the love
of God, if you begin taking meds
and you feel like killing yourself, tell
your doctor- right away. He or she
should make an appointment for
you immediately if the situation is
that urgent.

I was very lucky with the meds
I was prescribed. Theeffect on my
mood was transformative, and
my only signiﬁcant side effect was
drowsiness. But despite my suc-
cess up to this point, I live with the
knowledge that I could be in for a
world of upsetting withdrawal ef-
fects when I choose to discontinue
use. ' .

If this sounds like a mixed bag, it
should. I concluded that the beneﬁts
of medication were worth the risks,
and that was the right decision for
me. I made that call for myself, but
with extensive deliberation and the
constant support of a doctor. If you
ever have to make the same deci-
sion, keep this method in mind.

It’s cheaper than
you might think
to join the grow-

ing number of Pitts-
burgh cyclists.

Far from a typical bike shop,
Pittsburgh’s Free Ride wants to
teach you how to build and maintain
a'bike on your own .— for free.

Tucked away in the middle of
an old repurposed warehouse in
Point Breeze amid islands of old,
shrink—wrapped televisions and
piles of construction lumber, hun-
dreds of recycled bikes and bike
parts in various states of assembly
hang from the rafters and walls.
Assorted tools, chairs and deﬂated
tires occupy much of the ﬂoor and
counter space.

It doesn’t look like your tradi-
tional bike shop, and it sure doesn’t
operatelike it either.

Billing itself as “Pittsburgh’s
Do—It-Yourself Recycled Bike Col-
lective,” Free Rideoffers a variety
of programs for bicycle-interested
folk. One of them, called Eam-A-
Bike, is precisely what it sounds
like: Rather than trade hard—earned
cash for two—wheeled transporta-
tion, program participants donate
their time during the shop’s weekly
volunteer nights.

Earn-A-Bikers start by creating a
contract with the shop. They choose
a recycled bike to repair —— each
one has a set value, usually between
$20 and $150 — and for each hour
volunteered, Free Ride credits $8
towards the purchase price.‘

At abike shop, models typically
run $300 or more inorder to bal-
ance quality and proﬁt, Cory Can-
non, service manager at Biketek in

Squirrel Hill, said. For students and

' others on a budget, he suggested

Craigslist, Toys “R” Us and Dick’s
Sporting Goods as alternativeplaces
to make economical bike purchases.
“If you’re a student, there’s no need
to buy a thousand-dollar bike to
ride to and from class,” he said.

As for building your own, it usu-
ally takes participants eight to 20
volunteer hours to earn their new
rides. During that time, they’re also
required to attend two educational
classes at which they’ll learn about
a variety of bike maintenance'is—
sues, ranging from ﬂat—tire repair
to derailleur adjustment.

But employees at other local bike
shops said there are advantages to
getting a bike the traditional way.
Cannon emphasized Biketek’s qual-
ity guarantee. “You know you’re
getting a bike that’s put together
right,” he said. . _

At Iron City Bikes in Oakland,

manager Steve Kurpiewski voiced

some concern about bikes not

built by trained mechanics. “I’ve

seen plenty of stuff that people do
wrong, and it’s unsafe,” he said. He
added that consumers can also save
time by having a professional work
on their bikes, rather than trying to
ﬁgure it out themselves.

Yet both men spoke encourag—.

ingly of Free Ride..“It’s a great pro-
gram,” Cannon said.
Earn‘-A-Bike is one of Free- Ride’s

mostpopularprograms, and it’s not , ‘

hard to see why.
Joe Russino, an Oakland resi-
dent and ﬁrst—time participant, said

the program was a way for him to '

get an inexpensive bike after start-

ing a new job. But there are other
i beneﬁts to the program
‘laslfwell. ,

.',Biking is “a nice way to
 in shape, and it’s nice
for the environment too.
And recycled bikes are in

Se spirit of that,” Russino

_ said. “I like learning how
to take care of a bike while
_. I build it.” A

Will Wedler, a Free
Ride staff member and
instructor who ﬁrst par-

I Y  ini‘2,005, emphasized that

recycling and education are central
to Free Ride’s goals.
“It goes to the idea of reusing

and repairing instead of getting F

[something] new,” he said. “You
learn a lot through the do—it—
yourself mentality. Fixing things
up yourself, refurbishing things
-—- these are the sort of things you
learn at Free Ride.” A

Free Ride’s volunteer coopera-
tive structure and emphasis on
recycling allow it to maintain very
little overhead, Wedler said.-All of
its revenue comes from donations
and small sales of bikes and parts,
which afford it the ability to. main-
tain programs like Earn-A—Bike.

Free Ride is all about reusing materials. Scattered around its

Free section on Craigslist full of pitfalls

By Brian Dollard

All I ever wanted was a pool table.

Growingup, Ibegged forbilliards, .

but my parents bought me a foosball
table. Try and name one person who
has ever looked cool dominating a
foosballtable. Did Paul Newman gain
fame spinningknobs orscoring goals?
No, because foosball is, and always
will be, lame.

But long after I had given up the
search, there it was, the object of my
desire. Not in any storefront but on a

page of awebsite, Craigslistorg, a site _

that permits users to post and respond
to each other’s ads for goods, services
and personal connections. Better yet,
the posting was in the site’s free sec-
tion —-— basically a cyber garage sale

‘where everything comes free with

only a few conditions.

The last few days I’d been scouring
the site, having made it a personal
mission to decorate my room with
free items. I’d heard urban legends
of friends who had successfully scav-
enged for wares, and — considering
my bank account was as pitiﬁil as my
empty room — I had few other-op-
tions.

But-the tempting premise quicky
translated into rejection and disap-
pointment. My search proved dif-
ﬁcult and largely unsuccessful as a

widespread redecorating method.
But the search wasn’t totally in vain
- sharing my experience of ﬁnding
a variety of niche items could help

- penny—pinching students navigate

Craigslist’s free section and avoid
my pitfalls. .

The couches, tables and chairs fea-
tured in the section are reminiscent
of the type sitting on South Oakland
porches or burning after Backyard
Brawls. This makes the free section
ideal for students who do not mind
slightly scratched or used furniture
— particularly those who plan on
inflicting their own battle scars.

A rnini—fridge, 1950s bar stools

A and, of course, pool tables were just

a few examples of items I contacted
sellers about during my hunt for new‘
home furnishings. These items were
in wonderful condition from what I
saw in pictures — ideal for myapart-
ment. But I ran into one issue almost
immediately — the email reply.

I was rejected by nearly all of the
sellers I approached inmy search. The
large majority of my emails went un-
answered, leaving me clueless as to
the availability of the items I sought
The sellers’ lack of ﬁnancial incentive
provided no reason for them to pro-

vide timely or: informative responses. '
Craigslist works as an avenue of con- ‘

venience for the posters to remove
clutter, and giving detailed replies to
every s11-angerwith an email address

is most certainly not convenient.

Additionally, time is a commod-
ity on the free section, and while you
might think you are important, the
sellers will not be holding out for the
opportunity to give their junk to you.
I learned this the hard way from “CD
tower storage shelf” inBrookline. The
seller sent me an email saying another
shopper, picked up the shelf on the
same day it was posted. In the world
of Craigslist, speed dictates a large
portion of your success ratio.

And sometimes it’s up to the
“buyer” to make the object valuable.
The most common items Ifound were

i ‘ pianos, record players and outdated,

bulky televisions. Almost any elec-
tronic or musical device required

-repair or modiﬁcation.

Whereas other shoppers might
posses the DIY spirit to repair these

items, my personal technological in— '

competence led metoviewthese items
much like the owners did — as junk.
My friends in the engineering school
found the Craigslist free section far

more useful given their aptitude for -

electronics. A technological skill set
greatly increases objects’ values.
Although the Craigslist free sec-
tion contains awealth of potential for
home décor, afew items are necessary
for potential buyers totakefull advan-

- tage. of the service. The ﬁrst is physi-

cal strength or,for those of us who
maintainanunfortunately low bench

press max, muscularfriends. The bulk
of goods found on the free section re-
quire self-hauling by the purchasers,

and the ﬁeeprice tagis often based on
an owner’s lack of desire or ability to

remove an item himself. Additionally,

access to my roorr1mate’s lovably large

Chevy truck widened the variety of
products I could target online.

But there is a dark side to Craig-
slist. And it’s not murder — there was
a real killer who utilized Craigslist to
ﬁnd women he robbed and murdered.
However, Iam a personaltestament to
the website’s large murder-free com-
munity. Nearly all parties involved in
Craigslist dealings are only interested
in selling or trading goods. Though
you should always use caution, most
need not worry over personal safety
issues — that can be saved for those
seeking escort services.A far more
real and prevalent threat to users is
spamming. As a result of my ﬂood
of emails to sellers, I have recently
received more life insurance and
printer-toner deals than I thought
possible. One such junk—mail mes-
sage is a particularly touching email
fromjon C. abouthowlcanpay off my
house in 5 to 7 years. Unfortimately
bothjon C. and my “house” are ﬁc-
tional .— the products of spam email
writers. S  I ‘ ’ <-

The trick these spam artists pull is

posting afake adand then addingthe ~ ‘
_ email addresses those who reply to

aspam list. Many users, myselfinclud-
ed, discoverthis rouﬁne ﬁrsthand. My
technological incompetence blinds
me from speciﬁcally knowing which
faux—sellers deceived me orwhat traits
to look for in spam ads.

But from my courageous act of 

email account self-sacriﬁce (see: stu-
pidity), I learned an important lesson:
Create an email account exclusively
for Craigslist The simple step will help
you avoid both contaminating your
personal email account and limiting
the products you inquire about for
fear of spam.

After acquiringall this knowledge
and at least three missed chances to
bringhome my prized pool table, op-
portunity presented itself. I received
a timely email from a seller agreeing...
to the time frame I listed and even
a personal phone call guaranteeing
ownership of die table if arrived at the
stated time. I could almost caress the
red felt in my hands. _

But like an errant sinking of the
eight ball, my promising lead turned
to defeat. I overlooked the location of
the table —- Bellwood, Pa. I assumed
it was an obscure Pittsburgh suburb
when in reality the town is closer to
Penn State than Pitt. With my room-
mate understandably unwilling to..~_
drive the multi-hour distance, I was
forcedto regretfully cancelthepickup.
My pool-shark dreams are deferred
until the next table posting. I '

VOLLEYBALL .

 

Panthers fall in

Backyard Brawl  

Torie Wytiaz L

Stayf Writer

For the second year in a row the WVU

Coliseum became a site of heartbreak
for the Pitt volleyball team. _ J __

In the 2010 season, the Panthers

fell to the Mountaineers 3-2‘ in a hard-

-‘ foughtmatch, andonsaturdayevening,

nearly the same scene played out. The

Pitt team lost to WVU after ﬁve com- .

petitive sets.

“The Big East is a tough league,
and there are no easy matches on the
schedule,” head coach Toby Rens said.

~ “We knowthatwestvirginiawill always
present us with a challenge.”

For WVU head coachjill Kramer,
the WVU-Pitt matchup is alwaysfullof
emotion, whichcanhaveanimpact on
the players’ performances.

“In a rivalry match like this one, it
is ahigh-stress environment,” Kramer
said after the match. “Sometimes you
make somelerrors you wouldn’t nor-

mally make. But we fought through ‘

together, and that’s how we got the
win’) '

Inthisyear’s editionofthevolleyball
Backyard Brawl, the Panthers (13—9,

3-4 Big East) came out strong in the ‘

Vopenerandearnedthe 25-19 victory Ac-

cordingtoseniormiddlehitterLauren V

Hartman, starting the match strong
is something the Panthers stress each
weekin practice.

“Coming out early and win-

ning the ﬁrst few points is essenti ,” '

Hartman said. “When we are able to
do that, it sets the tone and keeps us
focused for the rest of the set.”

In the next two sets, how-
ever, the Mountaineers (5-J3, 3-4 Big
East) were able to gain control of the
match with 25-23 and 25-21 wins. Pitt
reboundedinthe fourth setaﬂzertaking

to a25-21ﬁnal score. 5

The ﬁfth set summed up the fre-
quentchanges inmomentnmthattook
place throughoutthe match, which saw
31 ties and 10 lead Changes.

“The entire match was a game of
back and forth,” Harunan said. “The
ﬁfth set showed the battle that both
teams went through.”

At the half-way point, the Moun-
taineets led 8-5,butthe Panthersputto-
gethera7—4runto tiethe score at12.

Then the Mountaineers put to-
gether their own run, scoring three

consecutive points for the 15-12 win
and the overall matchvictory. ,

“I have to give West Virginia credit
for their poise in the ﬁnal-set,” Rens
said. “They were able to push through

and get the key points when we were .

not able to do so.”

‘ Despite the loss, Rens was pleased
with the defensive efforts of his team,
which tallied 88 total digs. Pitt also
out-blocked WVU 17-8 thanks to se-
nior rniddleblocker Kiasha Leggs, who
earneda season—high 8 blocks.

“Evenin defeat, I could see that our
passing and especially our blocking
were strengths,” Rens said. “The solid
defense gives us a foundation to build
up our offense.” ’ -

That offensewas ledbysophomore
outside hitterMonicaWignot, who ﬁn-
ished the match with 16 kills and 20
digs in her ﬁfth double-double of the
season. _

W1gnot’s. all-around play has been
consistent in the Panthers’ 2011 sea-
son.

“Monica is a six—rotation starter
who has an immense presence‘ on the
court and at the net,” Rens said. “Her
totals against Westvirginia showthat,
and she had a great match despite a
loss.” . V

Freshman setter Lindsey
Zitzke also recorded a double-double
performance as she distributed 41 as-
sists and contributed a team-high 23
digs. «
For Hartman, the difference inthe

RAIN OF Al_J_Ll L

A coaches fantasy smackdown

Jim Harbaugh, who coaches the San Francisco 49ers, is known for his emotional style

Isaac Saul

Assistant Sports Editor

As the clock wound down during
Sunday’s NFL matchup between the
Detroit Lions and the San Francis-
co 49ers, a rare post—game scuﬁle
broke out on the ﬁeld. .
Players ﬁghting out their frus-

' tration is common during the ﬁnal

seconds of a game, but this quar-
rel was a rarity: It involved two
coaches.

Tensions escalated when San -

Francisco head coachjim Harbaugh
gave Lions head coachJim Schwartz
a dismissive and aggressive hand-

shake as he galloped around the

ﬁeld in celebration of the 49ers’ vic-
tory. Schwartz, not appreciating the
gesture, ran Harbaugh down and
bumped into him before players and
referees separated the two.

Although no punches were
thrown, this little scuffle got me
wondering: What coaches would I
like to see face off, and what would
happen if they did?

The Family Feud: John Har-
baugh vs.Jim Harbaugh

Height: Unknown.

Jim Harbaugh —— San Francisco"

Fighting career: Harbaugh has

~ ing career, most notably at former

NFL superstar and Buffalo Bills
quarterback Jim, Kelly. Harbaugh
broke his hand by punching Kelly,
and so missed a big portion of the
Colts’ season that year. _

Winner: John Harbaugh has the
“older brother” thing goingfor him,
butJim seems to be the one with the

temper and the experience. When _

prompted on Sunday at the press
conference about the post—game al-
tercationjim was involved in,John
said he “used to win some” when
they were younger. Comments like
that don’t inspire conﬁdence —— I’ve
got Jim Harbaugh taking care of
business for all the younger broth-
ers out there.

Winner: Neither of the two
belongs in a ﬁght, but they both

boast the stoic and stone-cold faces 1;
of truly weathered NFL coaches.

Coughlin played running back at
Syracuse, the rough kind of upstate
frigid area that makes me think
he’s a hard-hitting cookie. I’ll take
Coughlin in this one. -

Andy Reid — Philadelphia Eagles

Age: 53

Weight: My best guess? 380 lbs

Height: Probably around 6’Fighting ca-
reer: Reid is as soft as the Pillsbury Dough-
boy. 3 '

Rex Ryan — New YorkJets

Age: 48 . , .

Weight: Last January, the New York Post
reported that Ryan ingested 7,000 calories a
day and weighed about 350 lbs. .

Height: Doesn’t matter

Fighting career: Ryan has a few things go-
ing for him: 1) He’s a big—time Ultimate Fight-
ing fan. In fact, he infamously gave a fan the
ﬁnger at a UFC ﬁght and had a picture taken

of him as he did so. 2) He spends time with

these UFC guys. Ryan hosted UFC lightweight
champion Frankie Edgar atJets facilities this
weekend to give a motivational speech. It was
the second time he’s done that. 3) Ryan has a
brother, Rob, who coaches with the Cowboys.
Rob is about his size and the boys deﬁnitely
fought growing up.

Winner: It has to be Rex. He’s meaner,
tougher, more experienced and. a lot more
energetic than the monotone and soft-spoken
Andy Reid.

The Celebrity Showcase: Mike Ditka

‘vs.Jon Gruden

Mike Ditka - Formerly with the Chicago
Bears, New Orleans Saints

Age: 71

Height: 6’3”

Weight: 228 lbs

Fighting career: Ditka, an Aliquippa, Pa.,
native and ‘University of Pittsburgh alum,
has a reputation for being Mr. Tough Guy. As
a coach, he’s feared by his players. He even
broke his wrist after punching a locker during
a halftime tirade. He’s also had his fair share
of incidents from responding to or engaging
hecklers in the stands.

Jon Gruden— Formerly with the Oakland
Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Age: 48

Height: 5’1o”

Weight: Unknown

Fighting career: Grudenis known more
for his facial expressions than his physical
prowess. Nicknamed “Chucky” for being able
to muster a frightening stare saved speciﬁcally
for referees and players, Gruden has never
been praised for his kind ways.

Winner: Gruden has youth, but that’s about
it. Despite Ditka being 71 years old and one
heart attack deep, I think he’s just too mean
and too big to let a guy like Gruden toss him
around. I’ve got Ditka in what would probably
be a quick knockout. I

Consecutive losses to’West Virginia and
Connecticut have put the Pitt men’s soccer
team on the outside of the Big East Cham-
pionship looking i_n. But the Panthers have
an opportunity Tuesday to climb right back
into postseason position when they host
the Providence Friars at 7 p.m. at Ambrose
Urb‘anic Field. _ _

The winner of Tuesday’s game will
hold a spot among the Blue Division’s top
six teams, which qualify for the Big East

V Championship.

Notre Dame and Providence (7-5-1, 2-2-1
Big East) currently hold the last two spots
for the conference tournament with seven
points each. Pitt (4-9-1, 2-3-0 Big East) sits
in seventh place, one point behind.‘

“We are treating this game as the big— '

gest game of the season,” sophomore Pitt
defender Alex Harrison said Monday. “By
winning this game, we would be very con-
ﬁdent about making the playoffs.” '

The Panthers and Friars each have four
conference games remaining.

Friars forward Greg Davis had‘ a hat
trick in the game and now leads the team‘
with ﬁve goals this season.

Providence, though, isn’t the most of-
fensively minded school in the Big East.
Despite their breakout game against Seton“
Hall, the Friars attempt on average the least
shots (1Q.46) and earn the second—fewest

_ corners per game (4.08) in the conference.
Pitt’s offensive production is comparable; '

after facing two stifling opponents in West

per game. They’re averaging 10.7 shots and

goals-against average and .750 save per-
centage.

On Pitt’s side, the turbulence early this
year in goal appears 'to.have steadied un-
der freshman goalkeeper Lee Johnston,
who has started ﬁve straight games since
returning from a concussion. .

Johnston had several highlight-reel
saves Saturday against Connecticut (13-
0-1, 4-0-1 Big East). Pitt lost 1-0 in front
of 4,995 fans at the Huskies’Jos'ephJ. Mor-
rone Stadium, butJohnston was exception-
al against the No. 1 team in the nation.

“Lee Johnston is one of the best goal-
keepers I have seen,” Harrison said. “He
has been unbelievable this season, and I
think as a freshman this year he is one of
the best in the Big East-.” _ 1

In the 50th minute, Johnston stoned
Andrew Jean-Baptiste with a diving save
on a low, hard shot from 12 yards out. The
rebound went right to Jean-Baptiste, and
he let off another strike from close range,
butJohnstondove back across his body to
keep that out, too.

The freshman ﬁnished with six saves as
the Huskies out-shot the Panthers, 21-8.

Huskies forward Allando Matheson
scored the only goal of the game, his third
of the year, on a goal-line scramble in the
61st minute. y

Connecticut has allowed three goals in

14 games this season and is tied for the '

Big East lead with 23 goals scored. With
UConn’s success this season in mind,
even a loss against the Huskies can in-
spire hope.

“We’re feeling confident coming off the
UConn game,” Brode said. “We played very
well. We think if we can carry that over
against Providence, then we should have
a lot of success.” ﬂ ‘ ‘
