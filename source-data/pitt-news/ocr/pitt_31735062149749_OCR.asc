This course of a.ctlon. was deter-
mined at ineetiiigs of the execu-
tive committee and asscnibly of
SFA Monday and yesterday after-
noon. In addition to these plans for
student action, the group drew up a
personal plea to be addressed to Gov-

, ernor Arthur H. James.

House action on the cut took place
Monday evening, and the following
telegram was sent to important lead-
ers in Harrisburg in the effort to
block the cut:

“Don’t hurt students of Western
Pennsylvania by cutting Pitt appro-
priations.”

Gertrude Broido, C40, and Clarence
Shepard, C40, are supervising the
distribution of petitions and post-

The following telegram was sent
to the legislature by Mayor Cor-
nelius D. Scully:

“May I request on behalf of the
student body of the University of
Pittsburgh that you make no out
in the appropriation to that institu-
tion for 1939-41. Since the appro-
priation is a matter of great. civic’
moment, I wish to add my personal
appeal that the requested appropri-
ation be approved.

Cornelius D. Scully,
Mayor of Pittsbu_rgh.”

Miss Broido has
announced  text of the petition as

‘ follows:

“We, the underszigned, being mem-

bers of the student body of the Uni‘-

versity of Pittsburgh do hereby peti-
tion the Senate of the state of Penn-

Students are asked to sign their

full name, school, and year on the

petitions which will be circulated by

rooms today.

A. list of the members of the state
senate will be prepared according to
their districts to enable students to
communicate directly with those who
represent them.

Dean Thyrsa V1.7. Amos states that
the cut is setting the University back
ten years in regard to appropriations
and 25 years when new developments
are considered.

SF A Sends Appeal to Governor
To Stop Reduction in State Gran

Below is the text of the letter to¢
Governor Arthur H. James which
was drawn up at a meeting of the
SFA Executive Committee on Mon-
day afternoon:

The Honorable Arthur H. James,
Governor of the State of Pennsyl-
Vania,
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
Dear Sir:

At the direction of the student
body we are writing you in ref-
erence to the recent recommenda-
tion of the House Appropriations
Committee concerning the proposed
reduction in the University of
Pittsburgh’s appropriation.

We believe that the committee
fails to realize that if the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh appropriation is
cut, the slash will be felt by those
persons for which the University
was principally established.

There will be fewer scholarships '
available to deserving persons.

There will be less new reference
books purchased for the Library.
During the next two years scien-
tiﬁc research will be curtailed and
valuable members of the faculty
will be forced to resign and inex-
perienced graduate assistants will
take their places.

In short, Governor James, the
persons whose best interests you
have at heart, will bear the full
brunt of this curtailment.

The student body of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, of which I am
the elected president, sincerely
hopes that you will use your pow-
er as Governor of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania to grant us
the same appropriation as we have
received in the past. _

Respectfully yours,
Student-Faculty Association,
University of Pittsburgh,
Patrick J . Cusick, Jr.,

Engineering ’40, president.

WEDNESDAY, IVIAY 24, 1939

Editor’s lliary

T is with the customary regret that we open
our d.iary to ﬁnd only one blank page remain-
ing.

As we leaf through the preceding pages, we no-
tice that some of them appear neat and clean-cut;
others are somewhat blotched. On some the writ-
ing is precise and careful; on others it appe‘
hurried a11d scrawled. hit every page is jammed
with ‘the
Memoirs of a Memorable Year . . .

In. our diary, we have recorded news of resig-

nations, “strikes,” investigations, censorship, and ‘

other unpleasant things. We have not suppressed
facts; rather we, have reported many events which
have been disagreeable, and have voiced s~mn:—?
opinions which may have not always coincided
with official opinion.

Because of this, we suppose, we shall lie call-
ed by some “disloyal.” in sonic eyes, the total ef-
fect of our efforts has been to bring disrepute to
the University.

iWe challenge this judgement. If loyalty means
being a “'_ves-man,” than we prefer to be ‘termed
“ disloyal. ”

There have been happenings about the ‘Uni-
versity this year that no one, with any sense of
intellectual honesty, could blindly pass off. And
we,  the only coherent medium of student ex-
pression on campus, have considered it our duty to
stop and reﬂect and advise.

For we see in the l,7niversity of Pittsburgh :1
University with great potentialities. destined for
a top place among the finest institutions of the
land. \Ve see a mature, intelligent, experienced
studeint body, a capable and progressive faculty.

But there are. we feel, certain obstacles to be
overcome before Pitt assumes its rightful position.
Vile have continiiou.-ztly pointed out these obstacles
in line with our desire that this institution be
inaintained as some-tiling more than an ordinary,
run-of-the mine institution of higher learning, to
make it more a symbol of the dynainic_. virile cul-
ture that is Pittsburgh. Yet

We Have Not Merely Criticized . . .

An inspection of The News’ ﬁles will reveal inany
editorials and news stories praising and encm1r-
aging certain actions of the lTn.ivei-sity administra-
tion and others connected with the school. ‘We
have tried to recognize and applaud all that we
thought would beneﬁt the lbiiversity mill would
add to its reputation and prestige. ‘.-Ve have. like-
wise, not shut our eyes to opposite developnients.

All year long, after our discouraging start. we
have ever been on the alert to avoid censorship of
news and opinion. \Ve have insisted that  strict
line bedrawn between an advisory system and cen-
sorship, that. students be permitted’ freedom of ex-
pression on both student and outside affairs.

To the average layman, we may have appeared
a little batty over this issue. But we have :merel_v
upheld one of the cardinal principles of any self-
respecting newspaper, especially in a llniversity,
where, above all places. enlightenment is presum-
ed to reign.

During our short term of office. we have tramp-
ed on some toes, have barked a few shins. That,
however, is unavoidable. is in fact necessary if a
newspaper is to have any deﬁnite editorial policy
and'min.d; of its o_wn. An editor who would please
everybody would certainly be a wisliy-washy jelly-
ﬁsh of an individual.

It Has Been Our Policy . .

to champion every cause which we thought just
or progressive or hunianitarian, and to add our
small voice in the ﬁght‘ against forces of reaction.
In doing so, we may have been wrong at times;
we niay have gone overboard on occasion.

VVe have, however, attempted as much as hu-
manly possible to sound out student opinion, and
be giiided by it. In many of the large issues that
came up, we are certain that we were reflecting the
student opinion. In others we found ourselves on
the other side, and heard about it from our reatlers.

VVl:1ether our efforts have ﬂopped or have been

successful. is not for us to judge. \Ve do know that

we, of the outgoing staff, have tried to make of

The News a live, interesting, readable paper, to

make it more than a bulletin-board or house organ.

And we believe that next years very capable
staff will carry on and accomplish much more than
we have been able to do. So, with stiﬂed senti-
meritality

W'e Write “30” . .
at the end of our diary, and turn it over to the
competent hands of Bob Adams, who will take
over the editor’s chair after this issiie, _

 ‘We will trade-in our editors eyeshade for
a cap and gown, our copy paper for a sheepskin,
and our editorial columns for a “situations want-
ed”'ad. ' _ T

Al

* ly al‘fect every liniversity student is the cause
for the petitions and postcards being presented on
campus today by Student-Faculty Association.

It is possible that the state legi.-lature will pass
and Governor Arthur H. James sign an. appropria-
tion bill which includes an $88,ll()() reduction in
the University grant from the C‘ominonwealth.

SP-‘A is asking for the signatiires of the student
body in order to point out to state authorities the
opinion of the people who will be -most seriously
affected by the proposed reduction in the grant.

With the appropriation bill scheduled for pass-
 by the legislature this week, immediate action
is necessai-y if this cut  to be prevented. The peti-
tions and post cards prepared today will be sent
to TH:-m.'risln1rg to show that students realize that
this loss will have serious effects upon the liniver-
sity. This pressure niay have some effect in hav-
ing the illniversit-_V‘s appropriation urned to its
normal ainount .

"if this $88,000 reduction in the grant is pass-
ed, it will aft'ect the operation of every division of
the lfnivei'sit,v, and of services which beneﬁt every
student. As SFA president Cusick points out in
his letter to the governor. this cut will force cur-
tailmeiit of teaching salaries, scholarship aid. li-
brary :l‘acilitie.s, and research.

Obviousl_\f, it is doubtful whether or not the
petitions and cards sent to Ha rrisburg by SFA will
be effective in helping to restore the l7i‘iiv'ez‘sity’s
grant from the state.

But as students at the lJ'nivei'sit_v of l’ittslmrgli,
we owe it to ourselves to do everything; within our
power to prevent this reduction from being passed
by the legislature. \\=’e will lose too much if it is
enacted.

Technique

The Freshman Times, a product of the women’s
publication unit, seriously discusses lawn lolling at Pitt
and reaches deﬁnite conclusions. .

There are, conclude the freshman editors, three kinds -
of lawn lizards: the inexperienced, the experienced, and
the blase veterans. Those shrinking on the lawn
fringe, expecting‘ to be tossed off at any moment by Bill
and his marshals, are the rookies.

The experienced take to the trees, and make them-
selves at home ’ne-ath the shady oasis of a tree. The
veterans are casual about it all and grab off choice
chunks of lawn with the ease of Adolph grabbing oﬁ
chunks, of Europe. They take possession of anything.
The wnly thing that they haven’t done yet is pitch a tent
and camp overnight. Maybe they haven’t thought of
it. Or maybe they haven’t got a tent.

DESK CAN WAIT

The desk can wait until Saturday;
I will write the column now. It
shoulclynot be hard. From all over
,the t‘oi.i;n.try, the last exchange papers
lirom the other colleges and univer-
sities are coming in, and in all of
them, their student columnists are
bidding rather tearful farewells to
their devoted readers.

Almost without exception, these
columns are highly lugubrious in tone
and content matter. For it seems that
the student journalist, along with the
rest of his classmates who will short-
ly doff the cap and gown, is scared——‘
badly scared.

In some respects, he is justified in
.his fear. One does not need a de-
gree to know that the world is some-
what sick. It seems impossible to get
work. Once you have it, you must
sweat to beat the other fellow out.
And just about the time you are get-
ting along, some crank in the crazy
continent across the Atlantic is liable
to start the great drums of war beat-
ing again, and then all the weary
hours spent in a library or over a
tracing board will be of little use

WELLIAM C. BAKER, Grad:
No. There always is more effort
to protect the rights of property
than the rights of man. In an in-
dustrial age, the right to bargain
colectively ought to be one of the
, most important items of a new Bill
of Rights. Collective Bargaining is
often nulliﬁed "where the closed

us great names and has showed how
these names have contributed to the
long stream of lllSl.*0.l'3' that has come

news story, the methods of deter-
mining the tensile strength of a
beam, the way to run governments
which men have tried and found
good.

But above all, I hope, it has given
us idealism. Idealism is a funny

everyone is afraid of it. But it is

Krustufek should have no trouble
repeating his 6-1, 6-0 win over Mc-

and—cold southpaw. Hartman and
Harmuth, at No. 2 and No. 3, lost a

‘Gardlock, and Smith will try to re-

Speeds to Win

In Sweepstakes

With a motorcycle escort clearing
the way, Johnny Dickinson pounded
across the ﬁnish line in a burst of
speed to complete a winning drive for
Phi Delta Theta in the fraternity
sweepstakes, Monday. Phi Gamma
Delta was second and Delta Tau Del-
ta third. ,

Running in the third heat, the Phi
Delts got just enough competition.
from Pi Kappa Alpha to make them’
“put out” all the way and whip home
in two minutes, 53 seconds, a goodl
eight seconds better than the run-}
ner-up Phi Gams. :

The champs showed a well-bal-l
ancel (and well-built) squad of foot- 
ball players as they pushed Bob Ben- 5
jamin into the lead. Gregg, Andrews, j
Stebbins, Dannies and “Dicksot” kept 3
up a steady race all the way. '

Bobby Thurbon, number 5 man for 5
second place Phi Gamma Delta, was‘;
just about out on his feet at the ﬁnish I
of the tough, grind. The Fijis’ burly [
crew, Edmunds, MacNeill, Pressel,l
Ray Dimit, and Thurbon, were thei
early leaders, as they turned in at
3201.6 time under the whipping;
tongue of “coxswain” Bittner in the;
first heat. 

Real tough luck team of this year’s 
scramble was Delta Tau Delta. The}
Delts, who ﬁnished just a little over:
10 seconds behind the winners’ time, '
turned completely over as they spun
a:ound a corner. The loss of time
pdobably cost them a victory.

Though two-car races may have‘
le‘ssene'd"the thrills, the poor condi-
tion of the streets and the parked
cars left Director Potts no other al-
ternative.

Butch Hurts Ankle

Sliding into Base

If baseball coach Ralph Mitten
ling knew Sain \\'hite1nan he
would join in Saminy lament
that “times are so had.” but since
he doesn‘t, he will have to be con-
tent with. merely bemoaning the
fate that has given him two crippled
regulars at once.

For just when the boys seemed to
be learning a little of the ﬁne points
of the game, two of them, Al Hol-
brook and Al Butch, had to be put
on the doubtful list.

CASUALTIES HIT

Holbrook was the ﬁrst casualty,
breaking his right fore-ﬁnger in the
ﬁrst game of a double-header with
Penn State. The injury threatened
to bench him against Indiana State
Teachers, but healed sufficiently to
allow him to play. Fielding was no
problem, but Al was unable to grip
a bat and went hitless.

To top that, Al Butch, speedy cen-
terﬁelder, broke for second in an at-
tempted steal against Indiana and
came up out of the
dust with a.badly
s p r a ined ankle.
While the extent
of the sprain is
uncertain, it is
quite probable
that Butch will
miss at least one
of the two games
at West Virginia
on Friday and
Saturday.

But two devel-
opments of the In-
diana game have
helped lift some of
the gloom settling around Mitterling’s
head. namely, the improved hitting
of catcher George Hartman and the
continued swatting of ﬁrst baseman
Lefty Drobnewski.

DROB, GABBY SLUG

Both boys clicked off three hits in
four times at bat, Drob including a
triple and three runs in his contribu-
tion. ‘Should the pair keep up their
slugging, they will go a long way to-
ward offsetting the weak stickwork
of the once heavy hitters, Straloski,
Foliart, Goelz, and Butch. Goelz

 

Al Butch

.reached such a low Saturday that

after he had appeared at the plate
twice, Ed Kieper took his place in left
ﬁeld.

Once the weakest point in the
Panther’s attack, the pitching has be-
come a strong department with the
recent work of Lee Holt, Eddie Law-
TY. and Andy Johnson. Johnson has
been the squad’s top hurler all year.

Ted Meredith, former Penn middle
distance king. won both crowns two
years in succession, his junior and
senior years, but John equalled this
mark last year. In his quest for his
third successive two-event slam,
Wcodruff faces his toughest opposi-
tion in the quarter. There are no
half milers entered who rate in
Woodruﬁ’s class.

Edwin Miller, leading 440 man on
the west coast, and runner—up to
Long John last year, heads the list of
competitors in the two furlong event.
Miller has hovered close to the 47
second mark all season and may
force Johnny to better the 47 flat
ICAAA mark he share-s with Bill
Carr. The Trojan speedster negoti-
ated the quarter-mile route in 47.4 in
the Paciﬁc Coast championships last
Saturday.

In addition to trying for his third
straight quarter and half togas, John-
ny will anchor Pitt’s Penn relay
championship mile quartet in what
is expected to be the most thrilling
race of the two day program.

Although the brilliant Trojan four-
some of Jim Lytle, Ed Grubnock,
Howard Upton, and Miller covered
the distance in 3:13.7 in the West
Coast Relays, the Pitt combination
had little competition in the fast
Penn relay ﬁeld when they toured

the four laps in the record shattering
time of 3:l4.8 seconds.

Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara, Bud Graf,
and Woodruff, the winning outﬁt in
Philadelphia, will
probably go to the
post in Saturday's
ﬁnal. The match
between these two
great relay teams,
the initial appear-
ance of the event
on the champion-
ship programs
should produce a
record which will
withstand many
years’ assaults.

Ohl, the winged
sprinter, is the

Joe Newman class of the 220
ﬁeld, according to the comparative

 

tCarl Olson caught Larry in 21.3’ for
[second place at Indiana behind Ohl.
tom. svma IN 220

Another coast star in the 220 is
Brambacher of California who has
been clocked in 21.6 seconds. Ford-

ham’s Wes Wallace was credited with
a 21.1 performance at West Point last
week-end, but since he had never
even approached that ﬁgure previ-
ously, he is not likely to repeat. Ohl
and Tregonning, who will surprise
eastern critics, are sure place winners
in the 220.

The same duo are among the top-
,flighters in the 100 yard dash, but
‘Willy Greer, Michigan State’s de-
fending titilist, must be ranked ﬁrst.
The Spartan ﬂash has clipped the

‘century off in 9.5 seconds this year.

A

Ken »Clapp_,of Brown, has also topped
Ohl’s. 9.8 second effort, and Herb
Weast of Columbia and Willis have
equalled it.

The busy M1‘-. Ohl also ranks with
the leading broad jumpers. The 24
feet, one’ inch leap,.that surpassed
Everett Utterback’s old University
~ mark by half an inch, places‘ him in
the upper bracket that includes An-
son Perrna of Princeton, (24 feet. 91/4
inches), Don Blount of, Dai'tr;iouth,
(24 feet, 6% inches), and Kido, Cali-
fornia, (24 feet, 11,/4 inches). '
THREAT IN TWO-MILE

Another sure point getter for the
Pan'thers is sophomore Al Boulanger,
!two-nnler deluxe. Four men whom
he opposes Saturday have turned in
better times, but Louis Zaznperini,
the Trojan NCAA champ and con-
queror of Chuck Fenske, will proba-
bly concentrate on a new ICA.’-XAA
mile mark.

The other stars in the field are
Penn State’s Stranse and Henderson,
and Sadaj of Southern California.

Husky Johnny Bazyk is another
sure place winner. His 50 feet. six
inch s h o t p u t
heave has been
outdistanced by
only two national
opponents. Francis
R y a n , Columbia
ace and Don Mc-
Neill, Trojan foot-
ball captain, have
pushed the iron
ball 52 feet, 91/2
inches, and 50 feet
10 inches, respec-
tively.

Sophomore Dave
McDowell ra nks
sixth in a strong
high jump ﬁeld that includes three
Trojans: Wilson, Mallery, and John-
son, and defending champ Ed Burke
of Marquette. Joe Newman, the
ﬁfth sophomore member of the trav-
eling spiked shoe brigade enters a
classy hurdle ﬁeld. Al McKee, junior
quarter miler, tries for a place in the
event in which he failed to qualify by
Ione—tenth of a second last year.
