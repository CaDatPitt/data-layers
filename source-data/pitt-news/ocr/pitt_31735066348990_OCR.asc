The taping of Student Affairs
Advisory Committee (SAAC) meet-
ings has been discontinued after
Pitt administrators said the prac-
tice was unnecessary.

The discontinuation follows by
two weeks the revelation of alleged
taped inconsistencies in a presen-

order was given to end the taping,
done until recently by the secretary

‘but all agreed the practice served

no useful purpose.

The last SAAC meeting to be
taped, on September 5, was the
special session in which the
administration unveiled the coupon
exchange football ticket system to
student leaders. Students who
later listened to the session on the
Student Affairs tape found alleged
inconsistencies made by Myslinski
and called for his removal.

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Alfred Moye denied char-
ges from student leaders this
weekend that he does not solicit
adequate student input when

Government Board (SGB) and Jim
Datovech, chairman of the Resi-
dent Student Association (RSA)
were unwarranted.

“Moye runs a closed shop,"
Datovech said. “He tends to be
‘hardlined to students about his
decisions. ‘ -

“A lot of times he makes up his
mind on something, and immedi-
ately he assumes a defensive
position,” Datovech said. “He
doesn't discuss his views with
students, he defends them.”

The selection of a Duquesne
University student to the Pitt
Marching Band Majorette Corps
two weeks ago has sparked
criticism from former Pantherettes
and others who competed for the
position. ~

Students who complained asked

to remain unidentified.
« Jacqueline Stott, pa Duquesne
student, was selected to fill the
position left vacant by one of the
majorettes. ” '

Criticisms range from the fact
that Stott is not a Pitt student to
allegations that she should not be
permitted to fill positions rightfully
belonging to Pitt students. It was

also pointed out that Stott was one

according to Band Director Donald
E. Hower.

Stott has cross-registered in the
Pitt Marching Band.

“It’s quite legal to cross-register
for the band,” Hower said. “One
earns credits for being in the Pitt
Marching Band, and Duquesne
students pay tuition for it.”

“We try to put the best on the .

field,” Hower said in reply to the
criticisms. “It’s basically sour
grapes. Someone tried out and
didn't make it. ,

“If one of Mr. Cervi’s assistants
made the corps, then she must
have been the best,” Hower said.
“Would it be fair to deny her the
right to try out because of that?
Besides, there were four directors
and two students who were judges
and all decided on Jackie as the

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The spectacle of a high-energy
union battle for the control of
campus faculty bargaining unit is

PPU and PSE_A all will compete

. against one another, along with the
no-union option in the first
election.

If, for instance the PPU and the
no-union option are the two that
survive to the final run-off election,
it'may be almost impossible for the
PPU’ to draw upon the faculty that
supported either the AAUP or the
PSEA.

The impact of this division may
well be uppermost in the minds of
union organizers as they heat up
their separate campaigns for the
coming elections, which some feel
are just around the corner in
November.

The attempt to combine union
forces is a strategy that has proven
successful in other institutions,
avoiding the possibility of division
and fragmentation that could lead
to a defeat. if no-union survives to
the run-off election.

Pitt Unions May Be Snuffed

AAUP, in which the AAUP won as
the sole bargaining agent for the
faculty.

The Pitt combination proposal
made good military sense it seems,
but ideology, a highly ﬂammable
topic anywhere let alone on
academia, proved to be an
impassable bridge.

Faculty adminstrators and stu-
dents alike can probably look

“forward to a sudden jump in the

energy. of the union campaign,
already picking up speed.
Differences in national policy
between the PPU and the PSEA
probably eliminates any chance of a

combination there, particularly I

after a confidential memo from the
PSEA was received by AAUP
officers proposing combination
excluding the PPU.

Thus _it might seem that every —

union must now stand on its own,
although it would be wise to wait
before burying unionization at Pitt,

CORRECTION

In a story on veneral disease
carried in the September 24 issue,
it was incorrectly stated that VD
originated in the Americas and that
penicillin shots for the disease are
given in the arm. Actually, there
are indications that VD was spotted
in Ancient Greece and China, and
shots for the disease are given in
the hip. I I

The observer should postpone
the ' funeral until -after the first
primary ballot, when the dangers
of a loss to the no-union option may
well make stranger bedfellows than

ideology now permits.

It seems the universal purpose of
the unions is to expand their
control, membership and economic
power base. This sort of. evolution-
ary competition, survival of the
biggest, is certainly near the
forefront of union thinking.

  Maiorette Selection

Small unions are swept under the
rug.

Rather than surrender Pitt
faculty and a chance to lock up’ the
ﬁrst member of the prestigious
American Association of Universi-
ties, ideology may take the back
seat.

Public relations blufﬁng aside,
unions may face a more precarious
situation on this campus today than
since the ﬁrst petition two years
ago.

  Ignites Criticism

choreographer of the majorette
corps. When confronted with the
criticism'he said, “Our primary
concern was to have the best.”

According to Cervi, Stott was not
selected because she was one of his
assistants. “Jackie-’-s 12 years of
training speaks for itself,” he said.
“I have nothing to hide, because
everything was brought out prior to
the tryouts. The girls knew that
she had been an assistant but
everyone had to compete equally.”

“I knew what was best for the
majoirette squad after 20 years of
experience, ” Cervi said.

Stott had been an assistant
instructor at band camp this past
summer, according to Cervi.

Gun control gamble

Losing the Right to Revolt

BY TOM WASELESKI

The only reason why. gun control
cannot be implemented, and I
stress this is the only reason, is that
by ‘seizing the people’s guns the
government is taking away the
right to revolt.

V Allother arguments against gun

control are relatively insignificant.

Though locking away millions of
ﬁrearms will keep them from being
aimed at someone, there are
countless other ways of carrying
out murder, even on a President,
and still countless individuals who
would be dying to carry them out,
so how much would -we really have
gained? .

Would we get enough to give
up ‘once and probably for all the
ability to overthrow an oppressive
government if the situation ever
arose? Even if somehow it could be
proven that by conﬁscating private
arms no high-level assassinations
would ever occur again, I’m not so

sure the guarantee would be worth-
it. And any high ofﬁcial who places
his other life above a basic social
freedom like the right to rise upin
arms is no public servant.

Those in government will natur-
ally scoff at this argument, but it’s
expected because it’s, aimed at
their performance. Yet it’s too
crucial a social decision to be put
off lightly. Confiscating all-public
ﬁrearms and leaving them in the

hands of only the military and the '

police would be one of those
historically irreversible moves,
much like ending racial slavery or
finally allowing women to take their
rightful places in society. Pass a
law now that putsevery black on the
slave aution block or pass one that
places restrictions on the types of
jobs women may hold--impossible.

Pass a sweeping gun control law
now and in ﬁfty years when the
United States could very well be a
police state a popular overthrow
will be even more impossible.

Alternatives to unions .

Getting aPieee of the Action

BY LOU BOVA

All over this great nation,
faculties are turning to unions to
satisfy their desires for economic
security and a piece of the action.
Well, it’s time to realize that the
_union is not where universities
should go and it’s not where
students want to learn. In the long
run, a solid alternative should be
found. _
A recent symposium in Butte,
Montana, sponsored. by the Inter-
national Task Force and Ad Hoc
Committee on Higher Education,
generated many of these alterna-
tives,and it is time’ we all sat down
with a cup of coffee and looked
them over.
, Abolition of the Student: The
major problem in academia revol-

vesaround the need for professors
to spend time in the classroom,"

{often resulting in long hours of
instruction,— and even, in some.
remote cases, in students learning.
Some experts have suggestedtthe
removal of the student from the

academic scene would ‘solve many‘

of the problems forcing faculties to
unionize. . vr
Self-determination: The in-
creasing control by state legisla-
tures has prompted faculties in
many prestigious institutions to
secede from the Union, forming
their own governments with
passports and immigration laws.
Harvard and Yale, for instance,
have been distinct from the United
States for some time. ' This
accounts for the ‘difficulty of many
of their graduates in understanding
the concepts of democracy, consti-
tutional government -and due
‘process. This was outlined most

clearly in .the.recent Watergate.‘
Affair in which many Harvard’
graduates -were found to‘ be ‘

 
 

confused on the rmatter of
government for the people and by

the people.

Random Selection: Where

Foreign countries may be able to
arm small political groups, but who
could successfully arm 200 million
through black-market tactics? And
any country that would -attempt to
do so would certainly be doing it in

_ its own interest. -

faculty have decided that academic .

priorities, salaries and grades
would be determined by the

w outcome of scientifically controlled

tournaments of backgammon and
Parcheesi.
Collegiality: In a more tradition-
al format, advancement and
promotion are handed out to faculty
.members.-on a scoring basis divided
intopercentile regions on a
bell-curve distribution system.
Although complicated in theory,
the format is almost unworkable in
practice, with faculty scoring on
such inter- and intra-disciplinary

skills as/ifcocktail party mechan-

1’

ics, “aff’ability” A and, most
important, “tennis proﬁcioency. ’ ’.

Known better for many years as

‘-‘bootlicking,” this systemgained

wide acceptance in Europe ‘during ‘

the Middle Ages and survives-

today in academic backwaters and
certain indigenous Ethiopian bush
tribes. ' ” '
Institutional Anarchy: Notable for
its ability to standardize everything
through the elegant and clever
policy of having no standards.
First-come F irst-served:
bers of the faculty interested in
appointments to the positions of
dean, department chair and others
must complete an obstacle course
littered with pitfalls. traditions and
an occasional scruple. The first to
reach the appointed flag unscathed
wins whatever everyorie was after.
In retrospect, these suggestions
might seem futile, given the
increasing impetus of unionization

many of its subsidiaries, such as_

Pres. Disputes?
Sen. ‘Control’

I think the caption under Mr.
Wilson’s photograph [S. Council
OK’s Union Study, Pitt News,
Wednesday, September 10] stating
that Chancellor
“...control the union study debate
at Mon‘day’s Senate Council
meeting” is.both inaccurate and
misleading. It would have been
more accurate to describe .my
behavior during Council’s study
debate as that of a traffic director,
which is the usual behavior of a
presiding officer, rather than
controller. In three‘ years as an
Officer of the Senate I have never
seen anyone even tryto “control”
the Senate Council much less
actually achieve any measure of
domination over it. Patently it is
folly to try to “control” the likes of
Vice Chancellor Dutton, Vice
Chancellor Freeman, Larry Platt,
much less twenty or more
strong-minded faculty members ‘of
Council.

Even though Pitt is‘ resurging
as a national power. football seems
to be a dirty word around campus
these days. Its very mention brings
a variety of reactions, groans and
facial contortions. in a word.
students are distressed.

According to our student leaders
and student media. the athletic
department is up to its old tricks of

_ putting it to the students for the
reaping of greater financial reward.
The situation is best described by
paraphrasing that famous quote,

,/‘Never has so much been heaped
on so many, by so few.” .

The basic accusation leveled at
the athletic department is that it is
trying to run its football program as
a business. This really is not so
bad. After all, Calvin Coolidge told
us America's business is business.
Since football is as American as
apple pie, it follows that football
should be a business since business
is American. Right?

Not quite.

You see, Pitt runs an amateur
football program, designed to help
poor athletes, promote schol spirit,
boola boola, — and all that jazz.
Therefore,’football is really for the

_ students and not for Calvin

/rfﬁoolicige after all." Right?

Well. not quite.

contradiction,

The athletic department is trying
to run an amateur program like a
business. That is, it wants to
preserve all those hallowed institu-
tional trappings that accompany
football (the raccoon coats, ﬁght
songs, etc.) and at the same time
turn Over a profit that will enrich
the war chest and enable Pitt to
eventually take its place among the
Oklahomzis and»Penn States.

Somewhere in there is a
and the athletic
department cannot pursue both
courses at the same time. Our

‘student government has asserted

that the next step after color
coupons will be for students to buy
their own tickets. When that day
comes, the athletic department’s
choice will be clear. Football will
no longer be for the students. ’

Of course, a lot of headaches
would be avoided if the athletic
department would just drop any
pretenses of trying to preserve
amateur football. It should become
professional in name as well as in
reality. In fact, major colleges
would do well to band together and
create a minor league for NFL
football.

Instead of being the Panthers of
the University Of Pittsburgh, the
University would become owners of
a minor league, professional team
known as the Pittsburgh Panthers.

  ~A New NFL Minor League

Cas Myslinski could be the general
manager. That way. all Of his
shenanigans that are now called
“dirty tricks" would then be called
good business practice.

The relationship between the
University and the players also
would undergoia drastic change.
Instead of giving them scholarships
to attend classes and live in the
dorms, they could be paid salaries.
Instead of taking up class and dorm

I space that many players do not care

about, they would be responsible
for finding their own apartments.
If any wanted to go to school, then

- a special arrangement could be

made for them to goduring the
winter and spring semesters so that
the fall will be open for them to
‘concentrate solely on football.

Recruiting could take the form of
the professional draft with the
weakest teams going first, so the
polarization in talent that now
exists in college football would be
eliminated. , ‘ ’

Each team would be assigned to
a region under the jurisdiction of an
NFL team. For example, the
Steelers would control the area
including Pitt and West Virginia.

This system has many benefits.
The University would earn —a
percentage of the total profits, the
players would be better prepared

for the NFL, and the students;

would be absolutely sure of their
rights in regards to the football
team: None. .

While some students will com-
plain about the loss of these rights,
cooler heads will assure them they
are making much ado about
nothing, since they never really
had any in the first place.

Of course, there" is another
alternative. Pitt could become like
the ivies and give out only 6,000
dollars each year in football
scholarships, based entirely on
academic ability and need. If the
Ivy league would not admit Pitt,
then Pitt could always form a

mind and body, more aggressive
and confident. Women especially
need these feelings to overcome
the old idea that women are
helpless and weak. I've changed
for the better.”

No one can accuse Richter of
being helpless or weak, especially
after hearing about her rigorous
training sessions. Outdoor training
begins in February, if there’s no
snow. “At first I begin with long,
slow miles, but in April I start fast
workouts and intervals (sprints and
jumps).” ‘Long slow miles’ don’t
sound too difficult until one
realizes that 30 to 40 of them a day
is not equivalent to the ‘twice-
around-the-block-and let’s go
home’ trips the average‘ rider
takes.

During training last summer,
Richter’s day started at 7:30 am.
She rode from 8 to 10:30 and rested
till noon, when she went to work.
Such a schedule obviously didn’t
leave much time for relaxation, but
it didn’t seem to bother her. “At
night after work, I went home and
died. But I didn’t desire much

relaxation. I had so much fun
going to races on the weekends. I
just inundated myself with bi-
cycles.”

With classes in high gear now,
Richter intends to concentrate
largely upon her studies. But, as
one would suspect, her leisure time
activities involve the bicycle.
“Right now I’m running long
distances to improve my wind and
lung capacity--a major weakness of
mine. I don’t have much time to
ride now, but when I get a chance I
zip up to the Highland Park
Reservoir and do laps--interval
training--interchanging spints with
rests in between. Some lucky
people travel down South to race

during the winter, but at this point '

I have neither the time nor the
money to do so.”

Having just completed her first
season, Richter has a few com-
plaints about the unequal treat-
ment given to women’s races.
Aside from men’s races getting
most of the public’s attention,
women’s races are shorter and
have generally more inferior

prizes. The main problem, she
said, is that women’s races are not
as challenging as they could be.
“Women’s races must attract more
women to add to the competition.”
Although Richter admits that
prejudice against female cyclists
exists, she herself never felt any.
“It was my first competitive season
and I just sort of accepted what I
got, because until I get good, I
can’t get demands.” (And when
you get good?) “Yes, I will make
demands...”

In many ways, the athlete’s first
few competitive seasons are the
hardest because he has to learn to
keep his cool and learn how to
handle different situations. “You
have to have conﬁdence, to know
that you’re capable of doing
well--that’s where I blew it.
Seventy to 80% of winning is in the
mind. Inever said that I could beat
everyone easily, which is what the
best of them do. I would look
around and say, ‘They all look so
much better than me.’ You have to
develop avpositive attitude. , But I

never really lost my cool. I think of _,

When I was in the East, I learned
that every couple of minutes
someone is going to jump and that
you have to go after them every
time. It’s the ﬁnal sprint which is
the determining one.” She also
learned about the windbreak
advantage and how some riders
misuse it. Basically, the front rider
in a fast moving ﬁeld cuts the wind
friction for the following riders by
as much as 25%. Some racers take
advantage of this and “wheel
suck”--that is, they get behind
someone’s wheel and ‘just coast
along. The scorn that Richter feels
for “Wheelsuckers” is evident.
“They make the front riders do all
the work. I never did this. I felt
that if I didn’t, it would show that I
was stronger.”

Richter has what seems to be a
respectable record for her first full
competitive season, even though
she made some mistakes in
competition. Her inexperience
didn’t stop her from winning the
35-mile championship race in New

Cai‘ly’s sister is back in the
business they tried to crack
together a decade ago. With their
appearance on ABC-TV’s Hoote-

nany (you remember that), their
single, “Winkin, Blinkin and Nod"
(you remember that, too), and their

two albums on Kapp (who?)
Records, the Simon Sisters rose to

one of the all-time highs of pop _

music obscurity.
In the wake of the wreck, one

sank and the other swam, and the

rest is history.
Lucy Simon (a name that sounds

like “Lucy_ in the Sky with
Diamonds" after a car crash)
sounds amazingly like Carly.

Perhaps too amazingly. Whether
this comes from their singing
together or Lucy’s listening to her
sister's records, I don't know.
Experienced at writing chil-
dren's songs, Lucy shows it. She"
writes most of the songs on this
album and hers is a simple kind of

music. The melodies are easy to
pick up, the arrangements‘ are
basic and show no signs of
innovation.

One song I do like is “From Time

The 1975-76 Pittsburgh Opera
season will open at Heinz Hall
October 9 and October 11 with the
presentation at 8:15 of Jacques
Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffman.

The opera is based on three tales
written by the eccentric German
author E.T.W. Hoffman.

Offenbach’s opera transformed
the name of this exotic author-
musician-painter into a household
word and remains as a monument
to Hoffman.

Jonathan Dudley will be guest

of the Omaha Opera and has

Opera Studio and the Cincinnati

  

twelve years old, she won Israel’s
Tenth Anniversary Violin Competi-
tion. She then went on to more
studies in Israel, Switzerland and
the United States. 1969 marked

_,Fried’s debut at Carnegie Hall in

New York. This concert signals her
third performance with the Pitts-
burgh Symphony.

The concerto began quietly with
soft Woodwinds behind the violin
melody. - After the melody was
echoed by the oboe, the violin kept
reaching for new heights working
with the same chord pattern.

All of a sudden the music raced
wildly, crazily, as it challenged the
violin to accomplish sets of intricate
double stops. After a cadenza the
music settled down again to a
restless new theme (reminiscent of
the theme from Mel Brooks’ Young
Frankstein for all you movie fans).

Neapolitan dance music and
waltz rhythms highlighted the next
section. A solo horn initiated a trio
full of warm, romantic melodies.
Soon after a brief return of the
dance theme by muted strings and
resounding percussion, the third
movement began.

A deﬁnite battle between bril-
liant orchestration and an equally
bright violin solo was on.*The ﬁery
violin part won out as it became
beautiful and lyrical in making the

transition to another superb caden-
2a. The ﬁnish camenabout after a
long series of violin double stops
alternated with big brass chords.

Fried’s style was strong, deﬁnite
and well’-deﬁned. Her technique
seemed extremely versatile, being
dreamy one minute and very sharp
the next. Energy and vigor vibrated
from her with each new passage.

Egdon Heath, Opus 47 came to
be as a result of‘ the inﬂuence of the
author Thomas Hardy on composer
Gustav Holst. The music painted a
picture of a part of the English
countryside, of heaths and the
wastelands. .

A bass solo sets the mood--ser-
ious and melancholy. Holst scored
a large section of the string parts
for many divisions within each
string group. The Woodwinds and-
brass emitted simple, solid chords.
An unusual combination came from
the solos of the ﬂute with the
English horn. Muted strings and
brass signaled the end with soft,
misty melodies.

Edward Elgar hasicapturedsome
of the strength and dignity of the
English people in his “Marches.”
Played together as an orchestral
suite, they contained pert musical
phrases, soaring brass chords,

  Edward's ‘Garland’: In
Search of a Rainbow

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Judy Garland, Anne Edwards,
Pocket Book, pp. 349, $1.85.

“Somewhere over the
bow..." Dorothy. It may very well
be the way most of us remember
Judy Garland, the haunting eyes,
and the trembling lips. The world
has always loved Dorothy, and in
turn the star herself who seemed
constantly in search of somewhere-
-a place where dreams really do
come true. i "

We’ré all in search of that
nebulous “over the rainbow”
place, and this perhaps is the chief
reason _for the ‘current rash of Judy
Garland biographies. Some hack,
and some professional, but each
one striving to tell the truth about
one of Hollywood’s most unforget-
table stars.

In Judy Garland Anne Edwards
manages to tell the truth about
Judy, illustrating the facts behind
the legends, and the truth clouded
by the bad publicity. Edwards
reveals the people that surrounded
her, people that soaked power and
wealth from her, until ultimately
she was empty physically and
psychologically. Edwards brings
Judy alive, her hopes, her fears
and her dependencies.

Edwards conveys Judy Garland
as victimized and oppressed,
pushed and pulled in and out of
situations she never quite under-
stood. From the beginning her
mother Ethel Gumm was an
aggressive, show—biz mother, for-
cing Judy to perform at every
opportunity. ~ Some of Judy’s
psychological problems were attri-
buted to her mother's ambitions
and desires for stardom. It seemed
Judy always blamed her mother for
separating her from the only
stabilizing influence in her life, her
father. Judy married five times,
each time looking for a man to
replace this lost stability..

Louis B. Mayer, of Metro-Gold-
wyn Mayer,,took over from Judy’s
mother to become the driving force
in her life. According to Edwards,

Judy Garland, was __ entirely g in .

rain-

Mayer’s control, including her
marriages and divorces. As he
commanded, she appeared and as
he dictated she began a dieting
regiment ‘that strictly included
chicken soup and diet pills. The

diet pills threw her timing off, and
the Metro doctor began prescribing
Seconals. From that point, at the
age of 14, Judy Garland would
battle pill addiction until her death ‘
in 1969 at the age of 47.

“Somewhere over the rain-
bow...”--but Judy Garland never
found it as explained by her recent
biography, Judy Garland.

Edwards reinforces the picture of-
the exploited and vulnerable star.
At times, the book is pathetically
gripping. The collections of poetry
written at the age of 17 display the
raw edges of her romantic spirit.

The horror of Garland’s suffering
is repeated over and over, the
deceptions and the sorrows.

In reading Judy Garland, one

‘ almost wishes one could have been

Likely Strike Issues

BY PAMELA EUSI

There is a serious problem in Pittsburgh. By the time this goes to'_ 
print a decision will have been made one way or the other. Last night  »
at 12:01 am the contract of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ran out

‘and a strike is likely to erupt.

Both sides have several reasonable demands. Some of the orchestra - _
members, after giving years of service, are about to be forced to retire.  ,_
As one of the six finest symphony v 7
orchestras in the country they rank eleventh in pay. The minimal pay  "n
scale is $305 a week. A necessary living allowance is refused_thej._ T 
members when they are booked for concerts away from home for ‘as "i ,

with an inadequate pension.

many as 100 days a season.

On the other hand an adequate pension should be provided but new 3 
blood isiessential to any organization in order for it’ to expand and‘. P.-
Old members can be a hindrance especially in today’s 
far-traveling orchestras. Negotiations in salary have to be resolved.  n;

grow.

‘hopefully for the good of both sides. And either a living allowance

should be granted the members or else the traveling season shouldibe P

shortened.

. These issues must be settled. The Symphony is a necessary part of. A ' 
ittsburgh's life, as much an institution as Three Rivers Stadium or the‘ 
US Steel Building. Without a functioning Symphony Orchestra, _th,eU  
Pittsburgh Ballet and Opera Companies are also stymied. For the sake.‘ ‘ ' A
of the cultural life of Pittsburgh, the decision must be res
mature with all sides considered in the issue.

‘Steel’ Ballet Debuts    

. ‘J-

“Frankie and'Johnny,_” “Steel
Symphony” and “Winterset” f
make up the triple bill when the
curtain goes up on the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre’s (PBT) Bicentenn-
ial program October 3, 4 and 5. It
is the ﬁrst of the company’s ﬁve
productions in the 1975-6 schedule
to be. performed in Heinz Hall.

“Frankie and Johnny,” choreo-
graphed by Ruth Page and Bentley
Stone for the WPA. Theatre Project

1 _ in 1938, is based in the ballad about

a St. Louis boarding house slaying
in 1899 in which Frankie catches
Johnny with Nellie Bly and kills
him.

“Steel Symphony” is a_world
premiere ballet, choreographed by
artistic director Nicholas Petrov
and dedicated to the industry that
built the Ohio Valley. Two
Pittsburgh artists have collabora-
ted with Petrov to create a work
that depicts the actual steel-making
process in a multi-media presenta-
tion of sight and sound.

Sculptress Irene Pasinski was
commissioned to design the mag-
nificcnt steel sculpture, which will
take center stage as the set for the

‘ ballet representing the might of the
.indus_try. She has_ also designed
' the costumes,- which are being
‘constructed in the PBT shop.

 

The. music is} by residenitif

Carnegie-Mellon University com-,,_ 
poser, Leonardo ‘Balada, whose-~ _
work was originally performed by_  *

the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches-

tr_a two years ago. Balada took  ,_f"”
inspiration from the sounds. ,he‘ 

perceived in visits to the mills three
years ago. _ 1

This completely Pittsburgh work? ' , M
will feature the ' eiitire  -__i§

company. '

Also a world premiere, “Winter-  ‘A i
set" has been choreographed for_ 
the PBT by young choreographer,“  ‘

Stuart Sebastian. The ballet.is
based on a play by Maxwell
Anderson and is one of the ﬁrst

attempts by an ' American chor-‘
eographer to translate a drama into V

dance. The guitar music of Heitor
Villa-Lobos comprises the score. It‘
will feature JoAnn McCarthy, in‘
the role of Miriamne. '

The Pittsburgh Symphony Or- I

chestra, under the baton of Ottavio
De Rosa, accompanies the ballet in
this production. De Rosa, formerly
conductor for the National Ballet,
joins the company this season, as

Forest Rangers and finishing beauties find love and Yogi Bear
mountains of Colorado. Little Mary Sunshine draped in all her gaiety
drops a song at the upstroke of the baton. Fun, frills and cavity-laden
fluff are ready to attack every unﬂoridated set of choppers in town.

You might expect that the Civic Light Opera expanded its schedule
or another bicentennial musical hit the road (and will celebrate until
1977). -

But much to my surprise, this weekend Studio Theatre presents
Little Mary Sunshine. From the dark Cathedral basement an
unexpected pleasure will spring from the dark surrealistic shadows of
experimental garbage. The Studio is opening its heart (and mind) to
those who escape from life's realities into the arms of musical’s
banalities.

Little Mary Sunshine is the first musical Studio will present in the
past five years. Just as there is a responsibility to those whose souls
are filled with Pinter, Genet and Terson, so also lies a commitment to
those craving Learner and Lowe’s high-kickin’ show stompers.

An expanded schedule with greater diversity in playwrights should
provide a well-rounded season. And it would be if playwrights and
directors other than in the theatre department took advantage of the
Studio’s play policy. Anyone within the University Community can
bring a plan beforetthe Studio Theatre Board’s consideration.

So anyone from a janitor on up may become the new budding
playwright bearing the search of his pain through the printed word.

As soon as theatre becomes a real and valued property of all the
people, it will earn the widespread respect it desperately deserves.

creativity or intelligence. And with an inﬂux of new blood, both in the

‘TONY DORSETT finds a hole in the William and Mary defense.
Dorsett picked up 142 yards rushing against the Indians for the day,-

‘ BY JIM LEWIS

Oh, how perfect this world of

_ sports would be without that classic
' game killer, the mistake.

Coaches, managers and players

’ in_ every sport imaginable have

received headaches, heartburn and.

terrifying win stealer. '
The word mistake always seems
into the disheartened
conversation of the losing,coach--
“mistakes hurt us...”--“we made
too many mistakes...”
Edinboro made its share of

F-mistakes Saturday afternoon and
[ paid dearly for them, as the Pitt

Soccer team forced a 2-0 victory out
of the sloppy Scots.
As in last year’s game between

 V Edinboro and Pitt [which ended in

a 1-1 tie'], the Panthers forced many

mistakes but could not capitalize.

“We missed some open goals in
last year’s game,” remembered
Pitt Soccer Coach Leo Bemis,
“although it was a pretty even
game.”

_ Well, Pitt missed some good
scoring chances again on Saturday
(one of which included a hit

I‘ " crossbar and near-miss shots on

goal), but it was hardly a close

‘ game this year. Even though the

Scots had a better record than the

 ' Panthers last year, the difference

between the two teams on Saturday

 . was as obvious as night and
4, _day--Pitt had the better team.

“They weren’t as tough as I

though,” admitted Pitt fullback

Tom. Murphy, who scored the
Panthers’ second goal. “The coach
[Bemis] _thought we should have

I ‘ j scored four more goals at least.”

Pitt may not have scored those

. 1 four goals, but they did score tow,

-the first of which came early in the
ﬁrst half. And naturally, it was

 . . caused by an Edinboro mistake.

A. pass "from the left of the
,Edin'boro goal rolled to winger
who sneaked in
unnoticed at the right of the net.
Curley took a shot from an almost

       ‘Boaters Trip Scots,
    Mistakes Hurt ’Boro

One of the opponent’s defense-
men tried blocking the shot before
it could reach the goal. The ball
bounced off his leg and into the net
past a befuddled and helpless
Edinboro netminder. Pitt led at
halftime, 1-0. "

Midway through the second half,
Pitt scored an insurance goal as the

v result of an--you guessed it--Edin-

boro mistake.

A Scot i‘d{=-fenseman, in his
eagerness to break up a harmless-
looking scoring opportunity,
blocked a high Panther pass with

his hand. That, of course, is the ’

cardinal sin of soccer, and so Pitt
was rewarded a penalty shot from
the point of which the infraction
occurred.

Unfortunately for Edinboro, the
point of infraction happened to be
the. Scots’ 20-yard line, which
practically enabled the Pitt offen-
sive line to shake hands with the
opponent’s goaltender. In one of
the most dramatic and organized
plays of a soccer game, Panther
John Morahan gave a quick pass to
Murphy, who shot it cleanly past
the sprawled Edinboro goalie. Pitt
won, 2-0.

Pitt’s win against Edinboro
probably won’t overly impress too
many soccer authorities, mostly
because Edinboro is just that--Ed-
inboro. . It is a team Bemis
described as being “improved a
great deal”--but looked like it has
digressed a yearor two intothe
past. .

Despite the fact Edinboro is not
another Buckne:1l_ or Penn State,
the win Saturday is another victory
in the hopper and gives Pitt a
winning record (2-1-1) and its
second shutout in four games.

The Panthers are looking ahead
to Tuesday’s game against Carne-
gie-Mellon University at the
latter’s field at 3 pm. They hope not
to make as many errors as their
opponents did Saturday and to
correct any miscues they may have
committed themselves.

They plan to rid the word
mistake from their vocabulary for’
the rest of the season.

Anyone got an eraser?

A lot of good things happened
last Saturday. Tony Dorsett ﬁnally
lived up to his nickname of TD and
scored his ﬁrst points of the
season, Bob Haygood continued to
unlimber his newly discovered

throwingarm, and most important,

the Pitt Panthers devoured the
William and Mary Indians, 47-0, in
the Cats’ home opener.

“This is a big one win for us,”
Coach Majors said. “It helped give
the team back some of _ the
confidence they lost at Oklahoma.”

The Pitt defense lost no time in
asserting itself. On.William and
Mary’s ﬁrst possession, the de-
fense jarred the ball loose from Lou
Biondi, trying to run around his left
end. Al Romano pounced on it to

,. give the Panthers ﬁrst and'ten at

the William and Mary 32.

The offensive machine went into
motion but could only get up to the
Indians 16-yard line as the veer

- sputtered. With a fourth-and-six

situation Carson_Long was called"
upon to attempt a ﬁeld goal, one of
four three-pointers in the ﬁrst half.
Long’s 33-yard kick was good,
putting the Panthers in front to stay
On their next possession the
Panthers could do nothing with the
ball and were forced to punt, but
just as last week Oklahoma
capitalized on Pitt’s mistakes, it
was now the Cats’ turn to

,. .

  Hungry Panthers Devourlndians  

capitalize as Biondi fumbled Larry
Swider’s punt and Ed Wilamowski
recovered on the William and Mary
22.

Haygood tried the keeper but
could only gain one yard so he went
to the air and completed a 12-yard
pass to Jim Corbett at the Indians
nine-yard line.

Haygood’ tried keeping again,
and th-is time it worked as he
rambled for eight yards down to the
one. On the next play Dorsett took
the handoff and went over the goal
for his ﬁrst touchdown of the
season. Long’s kick was good,
making the score 10-0.

After Dorsett drew his first blood
of the season, he began to move,
rambling for a total of 142 yards in
18 carries. On Pitt’s next
possession, Dorsett took a Haygood
pitchout and bobbed and weaved
for 29 yards. He carried for another

ﬁeld goal making the score Pitt 16,
W&M 0.

Jim Kruis took the kickoff on the
W&M 15 and galloped past the Pitt
specialty teams and only a

_.last-minute tackle by Long saved a

W&M touchdown. W&M could do
very little with the ball, as was the
case all afternoon, and Pitt took
over on downs on its own 25.
Haygood passed to Gordon Jones
for the first time, and the freshman
receiver took the ball for nine
yards. Haygood went to the air
again, looking for Taylor down-
ﬁeld, but this time the long pass
was picked off by William and
Mary’s Scott Back at the 22.
Again the Indians were forced to
punt and Pitt moved with ease.
Haygood and Dorsett combined
for a 23-yard pass play. With the
success of this play, Haygood went

nine yards on the next play with’  I

Bob Hutton taking the next handoff
over center for four yards.

The Panthers could not move
very well after that and Long came
on to kick his second ﬁeld goal,
making the score 13-0.-

On thenext series of downs, the
Indians began to mount an attack.
Paul Kruis heaved the ball 31 yards
to Tom Butler on the sideline at the
Pitt 32. Kruis then reared back and
tried to hit Joe Manderﬁeld on the

six-yard line. Just as it looked like v 73

Manderﬁeld was going to pull it

down,‘Pitt’s Jim Farley intercepted ' 

the pass.

Pitt could do nothing with the
ball though, and an exchange of
punts followed, leaving Pitt on its
own 43-yard line. Haygood cocked
his arm and passed long downfield
as it appeared he had overthrown
Willie Taylor, but Taylor leaped
arms fully extended and made a
beautiful catch down at the William
and Mary 16-yard line.

The veer ran into trouble again
and this time Long kicked a 31-yard

We Still Don’t Know

BY JIM SPANOS

With three weeks gone in the
season, everybody should know

how good the Pitt Panthers are at.

this point. It’s not as though
they’re in the midst of spring drills.
The season is nearing the midway
point, the leaves are changing
colors, and the kids already are
anticipating Halloween. But no-
body knows “just how good” Pitt
really is. .
Several factors account for this.
First, Pitt has had trouble
generating an offense in the first
half so far this season. In the first
two games of the year, the
Panthers were shut out in the first
half, and against William and Mary
Saturday, the Cats could manage
only one first-half touchdown, even
though the Indians did a swell
imitation of Santa Claus in the way
they generously handed the ball to
the Panthers. ,
While Coach Johnny Majors said
“We probably caused two or three
of those turnovers,” Tony ‘Dor-
sett’s one-yard run and Carson
Long’s 33-yard ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst
quarter were a direct result of
William and Mary miscues. And
Long’s ﬁeld goal at theend of the

ﬁrst half was made possible largely‘ ' '

because of a short 22-yard punt by
the Indians’ Steve Dalton.

So now Pitt has two wins and one
loss and everybody is awaiting
anxiously the arrival of Duke. next
week while wondering how far the
Panthers can go. If there’s one man
who would have any idea of how
good Pitt is at this point, Majors
would, right? .

Well, no, not really. Before the
Georgia_ game, Majors said “I
‘think we have a chance to have a
good football team.” .

After William and Mary, Majors
said “I think we have achance to
have a good football team. It might
be the eighth game of the season

 , "2?f9"’5   We; learn ..-What. .1<,in<1 

«I x

 

football team we have. I'll tell you
one thing though, I like those
one-game winning streaks better
than those‘ one-game losing
streaks.”

A good reason for Majors’
hesitancy to admit the strength of
his team is due to the type of
schedule played so far. Against

Georgia. Pitt beat agood team. But .

when you evaluate the team, do
you look at the ﬁrst half, when Pitt
was shut out, or the second, when
they scored 19 points?

Against Oklahoma, Pitt played
the best, and it’s very difficult to

evaluate the team when it’s playing‘

the number-one team in the nation.

And William and Mary was,
well, not very good. I

For these reasons, it’s not an
easy task to judge the quality of the
Pitt team. '

Some statements can be made
about various aspects of the game,
however. '

For one thing, Pitt learned how
to put the ball in the end zone when
the opportunity arose in the second.
half, something it couldn't do in the
ﬁrst. Dorsett showed he is every bit
as good this year as last, as his
33-yard touchdown run at the start
of the second half demonstrated.

Dorsett ﬁnished the afternoon
with 142 yards rushing on just 18
attempts, and thus far this year has
picked up 263 yards. He’s
averaging 5.8 yards per carry.

The Panthers also showed was
that their corps of receivers is
everything it was cracked up to be.
Willie TayIor’s catch of Robert
Haygood’s 41-yard pass was
phenomenal, and Gordon Jones
made a few moves that would have
made Houdini look like an amateur.
Add to that Karl Farmer, who

injured a knee early in the game,

tight end Jim Corbett, Rodney
Clark, and Randy Reutershan and
you’ve got quite. a group of
receivers. Just like everybody said;

greatest by ‘a Pitt team (in a
winning cause) since 1937, when
Pitt defeated Ohio Wesleyan, 57-0.
Only very seldon do you win a
game by forty-seven points, no
matter who it is you’re playing
against.

“We needed it,” Majors said of
the lopsided score. “A young team

needs to win big occasionally just to

get thetasteof it.” .
. Dorsett, who is still the heart and
soul of the Pitt backfield, was

' equally satisfied with the impres-

sive Pitt win. ~

“It brought a lot of conﬁdence in
our offense, and our defense, too,”
Dorsett noted. “It’s always more
fun when you win. I don’t care if
we’re playing Hopewell High
School as long as we win.”

Dorsett’s three touchdowns
against William and Mary were his
-first this year, but getting
touchdowns takes a back seat to
something else.

“My thing is getting yards,”
Dorsett said. “If I can get over
1,000 yards, and not score any
touchdowns, that’s all right with
me.”

Whether Dorsett gains 1,000,
1,500, or 15,000 yards, one fact is
clear--If Dorsett has a goodday
rushing, then chances are Pitt will
be in the ball game.

Stopping Longis almost impos-
sible. Long has missed just one kick
all year, and against the Indians he
set a Pitt record for ﬁeld goals in
one game, all in the ﬁrst half.
Long's kicks of 33, 23, 31 and 46
yards ﬁrmly established his repu-
tation as an all-American candi-
date, if there ever was any doubt.

Panthers‘ Destroy W&M

(Continued from Page 12)
46-yard attempt was good, making
the score 19-0 and giving Carson a
school record for most field goals in
one game. Long had shared the
record at three, but now possesses
it all by his lonesome.

Although Pitt was ahead at the
end of the half, 19-0, the offense
appeared very sluggish and the
veer did not seem to be working
very well, so it was in the second
half that the Panthers came out
growling to vindicate their sloppy
first half. -

William and Mary had the ball at
their own 33-yard line with fourth
down and six inches to go for a
first. The Indians decided to go. for
it and made a big mistake. Romano
and company met Tom Smith at the
line of scrimmage and pulled him
down ‘before he could go even two
inches.

TD then took a Haygood pitchout
33 yards for the touchdown, but not
before he attempted to put on a
show for the fans. As Dorsett got
closer to the endzone he turned
around and tried to back in, giving
the William and Mary defender a
nice howdey-do.

The Indian defender didn’t find
it very funny at all, and just as
Dorsett released some of his

frustrations in hot-dogging the

the William and Mary

play.

Cavanaugh led the Panthers

defender released his by nailing
Dorsett as he crossed the goal line.

“I just thought I’d do a little
something extra for the crowd,”
said Dorsett afterwards. “That
guy really took me by surprise.”

Elliott Walker was not one to
stand by, and let Dorsett have all
the fun. Walker took the ball 33
yards down to Indians’ 30. Dorsett
then picked up another eight, and
Hutton ran for five. Dorsett got
another ten before Hutton went off
tackle for seven yards and
touchdown. I

“That hole was so big, you could
have run off the sideline and
scored,” Hutton said. “The
offensive'- line blew open the holes
a lot bigger in the second half so we
all looked better.”

Following Hutton’s touchdown,
Pitt could do no wrong and when
the Indians went to the air again,
Pitt’s Jeff Delaney wasthere to
pick off theerrant Tom Rozantz
pass.

Pitt turned the interception into a
touchdown drive highlighted by a
23-yard Haygood-to-Jones combin-
ation, a combination we’ll be
hearing a lot from in the next two
seasons.

On Pitt’s next possession it was
the second team’s turn to put some
points on the scoreboard as Matt

Everyone got into the act. Mike
Balzer, a freshman playing safety

“That was a big thrill for me,”
Balzer said. “I know I won't get to
play much this season, but Denny’s
been teaching me a lot and I guess
it paid off.” ’

_Balzer accounted for one of the
three "interceptions that helped

BY STEVE SYBERT

What’s wrong with the Chicago
Black Hawks? The once-powerful
Hawks of old have turned into the
Ten (or is it Eighteen?) Little
Indians and may ﬁnd selling beads
more profitable this year than
playing hockey. p
. The great players who led
Chicago to a string of winning
seasons are gone, many through
raids from the World Hockey
Association [WHA]. The Black
Hawks now are sorely missing the ‘
likes of Bobby Hull, Pat Stapleton,
J .P. Bordeleau and others, who
elected to jump to the new league
and its fortunes. V '

Chicago‘ ﬁnished third in the
Smythe ‘Division last year, behind
Vancouver and St. Louis, despite
allowing the fewest goals in the
division. With “Mr. No,” Tony
Esposito, back to improve on a,
dismal-for-him'2.74 goals against
average, the Hawks should Cllmb
back to the top, though a tight race
-this -year is inevitable. A -

Esposito is the key. The kid
brother of goal-‘scorer Phil played
in 71 of 80 games for the Hawks
last year for 4,219 playing minutes.
nearly .400 more than his closest
competitor, the Canucks’ work-
horse, Gary Smith. This was due to
the absence of an adequate
back-up in the Windy City. Both
Mick Veisor and Michel Dumas are
untested. but will be looked upon to
give Esposito some relief this
season.

Like Boston’s, the Black Hawks’
top line began to sputter and the
result was Jim Pappin’s departure
for the California sun. Why Pappin,
and not Dennis  or Pit Martin,
is a good question. Pappin led the
Hawks with 36 goals [plus 27
assists for 63 points], while Hull [37
points] and Martin [45]- had for
worse seasons. Joey Johnston
[14-23-37] went to‘Chicago from the
Seals. -

The Black Hawks’ biggest threat
on offense will be Stan Mikita,

their only representative (ﬁfteenth)
in the league’s top 25 scorers, with
36 goals and 50 assists last season.
With Martin and Ivan Boldirev (67
points) too, the ‘ Hawks have
strength at center, where it counts.
The defense must offer Esposito
a little more protection if the
Hawks’ comeback is going to take
place. Chicago’s back-line corps of
Bill White, Phil Russell, Doug
Jarret and Dick Redmond ranks as
one of the league’s best, although a
bit sluggish last season. Ahealthy
Keith -Magnuson could help out.
The St. Louis Blues could
overtake Chicago if an answer is
found to their goaltending ques-
tion. The Blues traded away young
John Davidson [3.66 average] to

  

,the New York Rangers. Davidson,

only 22, was once thought of as
holding the Blues’ future in his
glove hand.

Gilles Gratton ﬂed to St. Louis
from the Toronto Toros of the WHA
and, along with veteran Eddie
Johnston (3.10) and rookie Ed
Staniowski, will try to keep the
Blues in step with the war-dancing
Black Hawks. Yves Belanger (2.72)
also will be given a shot. .

St. Louis is loaded with young
talent "on defense. Nineteen-year-
old ‘Bob Hess’ is _a potential
superstar, while Larry Sacharuk

and tough’ guy Bob Gassoff are also '

big in the Blues’ future hopes. Two
of the notorious Plager brothers,
Barclay and Bob, are still in town to
provide some experience. Barclay,
though, will sit out the first ﬁve
games for ramming‘-a referee into
the boards last year. -
Ironman Garry Unger [36-44-80
and Pierre Plante [34-32-66] will be
offensive leaders, with Wayne
Merrick [65 points] and Chuck
Leﬂey [52] helping out. Trades
brought to St. Louis, Red
Berenson, who led the Blues to the
Stanley Cup finals three times from
1968-70, and Ted Irvine and Gerry
Butler from the Rangers.
Vancouver won the division
crown last yar, but how they

managed that, nobody knows. With
a record of 38-32-10, the Canucks
actually were ranked only ninth in
the league overall. They no doubt
owe last season’s‘ title to the
division set-ups.

‘Andre Boudrias (16-62-78) was
the Canucks’ leading scorer, but
was only twenty-fourth in the
league. Don Lever’s 38 goals was
tops on the-club, while John Gould
contributed 34‘ goals, then jumped

to the‘WHA’s Cincinnati Stingers. I

Dennis Ververgaert and ' Chris
Oddliefson (both with 51 points)
will be looked upon to ﬁll Gould's
skates for the Canucks.

On defense, Vancouver is ade-
quate with goaltender Gary Smith
[729 games and a 3.09 average] as
the anchorman. Big Bob Dailey,
Mike Robitaille and Tracy Pratt

lead the corps of defensemen.

The Minnesota North Stars are
ailing. Their 341 goals allowed was
the league’s second worst to
Washington’s 446, while their
offense, at fourth worst, was only a
shade better. --Those are bad

credentials for a once-great hockey’ A

club. — ‘
Former captain Ted Harris,

_recently retired from the Philadel-

phia Flyers, is set to take over the
coaching chores. Harris won’t have
much to work with this season.

Scoring leaders Dennis ‘Hextall’
»(15-57-74) and Bill‘ Goldsworthy I
i(37-35-72) are the only bright spots

on the team. Ernie Hicke was the
North Stars’ third leading scorer
with a mere 36 points.

Minnesota will be without the
services of Henry Boucha, who lost
partof the sight in one eye from the
January Dave Forbes incident.
Boucha was suspended in March,
and finally jumped to the WHA’s
Fighting Saints, the North Stars’
crosstown rival. Utility forward
Glen Sather, though, was picked up
from Montreal to replace him.

Goalie Cesare Maniago, once

stingy in the nets, recorded a"

dismal 4.20 average and may lose

his job to youngsters Pete LoPresti '
