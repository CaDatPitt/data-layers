Memorial at 11 :30 Friday morning.

Fourth hour classes have been dismissed and voting at
women’s elections will be closed from 11 :30 a. in. until 1:00
p. In. so that students may attend the program at which the
Rev. Dr. Solomon B. Freehof will discuss “Scholarship 1n an

The 1948 Scholars’ Day Booklet

lists four hundred eighty tappees
to scholastic organizations and at
the assembly four scholarships
will be presented and seven
awards made for outstanding
achievement in several ﬁelds of
scholastic endeavor.

Attempting to keep the program
within the hour for which classes
' have been dismissed, the Scholars’
Day Committee has scheduled on-
ly the presentation of awards and
scholarships, a musical selection
by the Cornet trio of the Pitt
Concert Band, and the address by
» Dr. Freehof on the assembly pro-

Dr. Frehof will be introduced by
Marjorie Zulauf, Chairman of the
Scholastic Honors Committee of
the Women’s Self Government
Association (WSGA).

Recipients of awards and schol-

tappees will receive lapel ribbons
as mementos of Scholars’ Day.
Both the Scholars’ Day booklets
and the lapel ribbons will be dis-
tributed after the assembly.

“Scholarship in an Uncertain

chairman at the temporary Trustees Committee, estimatedvthis Tues-
day when the long—awaited report of the University Trustee Inves-
tigating Committee was made public. A

Virtually the only change adopted by the trustees was the aboli-
tion of the Faculty Committee on Athletics and its replacement by an
eight-member Athletic Committee. Since this new board has “the
sole authority in regard to personnel” and is not expected to be ready
to operate before June, the jobs of Hagan and Milligan are secure
until then.

A standing “Supreme Court” of three trustees also is to be formed

to “adjudicate all matters of dispute in the Athletic committee.”

Dr. Freehof is recognized in

Pittsburgh and throughout the
nation as an outstanding scholar
and lecturer.

A graduate of the University of
Cincinnati and the Hebrew Union
College, Dr. Freehof has been as-
sociated with the Rodef Shalom

Topic for War Writer.

Sigrid Schultz, noted woman journalist and reporter, will
appear tomorrow, April 14, from 2:30 to 3:30 p. m. at Foster
Memorial. She will speak on the “Reeducation of Germany.”

Miss Schultz, author of “Germany Will Try. It Again,”
was ‘Director of the Chicago Tribune ’s Central European Bureau
in Berlin for 16 years. She has known the important political

ﬁgures of the times, including
She served as a war correspond-

ent, covered the first of the War

Crimes trials, and is now making

a study of Germany in transition.

Convinced that Germany will
try again for world domination,
Miss Schultz contends that these
plans can be thwarted only by
alertness and energy on the part
of United Nations.‘

She believesthat reform can-
not be imposed on the Germans
from without, but must come from
the people themselves, under some
form of self-government.

Her lecture, sponsored by Stu-
dent Congress, is open to all stu-

. dents.

Scholars Beware

This Friday, Pitt celebrates Scholar’s Day

again. From the reports eiitering the oiﬁce,
the only similarity between this and last
year’s Scholars’ Day is the name. The pro-
gram is entirely revamped and speeded up for
the consumption of the student body.

For a change, we recommend attendance
at Scholars’ Day because it has been aimed
toward the student. Rabbi Freehof, a speaker
of long standing note, is the crux of the pro-
gram. Around him weaves a simple recogni-
tion ceremony for those students. who excel.

It is not an easy matter to congratulate
a.nother student on his 3.—when you struggle
with a .95. But, this is an attempt to recognize
these men as putting in all they have for their
education. Attendance is made particularly
easy with the dismissal of classes, Friday,
fourth hour. ~'

A Change Here, .Te0

, This week-end, the women of the Univer-
sity place ballots for theirfavorites. As yet,
no one knows who the nominees are. No one
will know until 12 hours before the elections.

This phenomenon of “clean elections” gen-
erally‘ works to the detriment of. democratic
procedures. The men, in their nominations for
this year’s congress, realize the weakness of
autocratic selection of nominees. They hope to
minimize this through opening the ballot for

. write-ins.

But, the decidedlyquiet way with which
both men’s and women’s candidates are se-
lected leaves much to be desired from a demo-
cratic point of view. To be blunt, picking can-
didates behind closed doors is the principle
of “election” in the occupied countries in
Eastern Europe. It doesn’t smell too good.

We.hope that WSGA considers these little
ﬁne points of thought next year when they de-
cide on the method of election.,The years past
have" proved that the present method. isn’:t
satistactory for the women involved or satis-
factory to the women who vote. 1»,

While There’s Time

Once again the genii of past freshman classes
undertake to instruct the current crop of fresh-
man in courses they might not pass without

‘instruction. The Phi Eta Sigma members, all of

whom -make better than a. 2.5 Q.P.A. during
their ﬁrst year in college, devote several hours
weekly toward aiding those interested in‘ bet-
tering their grades “while there is still time.”

In Phi Eta Sigma we see an honorary frater-
nity which is more than a mutual admiration
society, a classiﬁcation into which many of our
honorary‘ fraternities have fallen.

Tomorrow morning registration for this
semester’s tutoring program gets underway in
the office of the dean of men. Any freshman
who feels he is in danger of failing any of the
courses in which assistance is offered can regis-
ter for Phi Eta Sigma classes free of charge.

The only prerequisitezfor registration is that

« the individual student must put forth an honest

effort to increase his class-room standing.

 Chancellor Pushes
Cal-hedral Work

 And Building Plans
By Bill Veenis

Regardless of how one may feel about the for-
tunes of the University of Pittsburgh, most students
look with a great deal of pride on the amountof
work that is moving toward completion around the
Cathedral walls.

Since last year at this time, most of the rooms
on ﬂoor three have been rendered complete ex-
cept for a coat of paint. Much has been done
on thethirteenth and sixteenth ﬂoors. Stair-
wells around the University are getting that
plastered look. Cabinet makers are applying
the last sandpaper rubdown to the student
desk’s artistic panels. ‘ I E

Even the eight ﬂoor--haven of miscreants, Deans
of Men, publications, and the YMCA-—-[ﬁnds itself
half-completed. . — a

Credit fo rthis amazing surge of industry around
the Cathedral might be placed with the Veterans
Administration in Washington and a terriﬁc up-
surge in enrolhnent. It might be placed to the down-
right disgusting appearance of the red-tiled walls.

But the major share of motive power behind
the Cathedral -face-lifting‘ belongs to long-lean
Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald. The major admin-
istrator of the University sci his functional goal
here at completion of the Cathedral and com-
pletion of the adjacent buildings. In less than
three years, he has done much toward this end.

But, as the barker friend says, this is only the
beginning. Dr. Fitzgerald, by incessant prodding of
the necessary persons, has laid many plans and
budgets for the completion of other University

-buildings. What they are and how soon they will

be constructed must remain quiet until ﬁnal deci-
sion. But the ground work is there. And the same
man is doing all of it. ‘

Out of the ,ﬂood of people who pass before the public eye I‘
there are a few whose deaths are taken as a personal loss by
all. Jock Sutherland is one of these few. His passing touches not
only the Pitt football men who carried his teachings to victory,
1101? merely the coaches who respected his methods, but those
people who know nothing about football, people to whom Jock
Sutherland was a. symbol. i i

To these people Sutherland was a name that had lingered.
in the backs of their minds. They remembered perhaps that he '
was a star football-player at Pitt. More likely they remembered E
the teams he built and the all-stars he helped mould here. As
Jock Sutherland rose, Pitt rose with him. Wherever he went
after leaving Pitt, Sutherland carried a favorable reputation of
the University, a reputation he helped create. Through him
these people met Pitt. Both we and they shall remember Jobk
Sutherland as a. Pitt emissary, silent, but well accounted for.

feeling Workmaster has concerning Pitt politics.

marks campus politics. And, as usual, both motivated andsino

The case for immediate world federalism will be presented
to Pittsburhers by Leland Stowe, war correspondent and author,
tomorrow night at 8 :30 p. m.‘ in Carnegie Music Hall. _ n _

Stowe, in a lecture entitled “VV,h1l_e.T1Ine\Itema1ns, will
call for. increased U. S. faith and_part1c1pat1on 111 the United
Nations. He is sponsored by the United World FedeI‘a11S.tS-

The UWF believes that world union 1S necessary to world
peace. It advocates bolstering the
UN with a View of transforming
it into a world government at the
earliest possible ‘date.

The lecture is not restricted to

selling at $1 for the general pub-
lie and 50 cents for students. They
may be purchased by calling GR.

A crack foreign correspondent
for more than two decades, Leland
Stowe has covered every import-
ant news event in Europe since
1924.

From a vantage point within
Germany he watched the rise of
Hitler and Nazism. As early as

German menace in a book, "Nazi
Means War.”

' After hostilities broke out Stowe
had a front line seat for the Rus-
so-Finnish War, the invasion of
Norway and the conquest of the
Bakans. He compiled his early
wartime experiences in a second
volume, “No Other Road to Free-
dom.”

Subsequently he wrote two oth-
er book=s—“They Shall Not sleep,”
which dealt with the Russian
front, and “While Time Remains,”
his first plea for international ac-
tion to prevent war.

Besides Stowe the organization
boasts an imposing list of public
ﬁgures among its membership. In-
cluded in the group are such
prominent Americans as Dr. Al-
bert Einstein, Radio Commentator
Raymond Swing and Varl Van

Mr. Kirkpatrick has traveled
c widely throughout the West study-
ing the area’s natural 0 wonders.

erican Society of Civil Engineers.
He presented a paper on “West-
ern Pennsylvania Pollution Abate-
ment Program.”

Dean Holbrook, who at present

in the business of text books,”
Student Book Exchage on Fifth

He tells the story of a student who sold him stolen books on
two occasions, and, but for the good memory of his assistant, would

have continued to do so.

Due to the great ﬂow of both used and new books that pass

across their counter, the book¢
store has now set up a card sys-
tem which, though costly to them,
affords some protection to the
student as well as the company
from such misrepresentations.
Must Fill Out Card

Each student selling books to
the store must sign a card which
is used as a record of the sale
plus identiﬁcation of the student
receiving payment.

Mr. Headlee says that the aver-
age loss through stolen books is
only a little over $5 per year
compared to the great expense of

“But the gain in good will and
honest business is worth the cost,”
he remarks.

Both Men Vets

Veterans of World War II, Mr.
Headlee and his assistant, L. D.
Van Sickle, have both had wide
experience in the college store
ﬁeld. Mr. Headlee himself earned
his college education by working
in a book store, and has had 20
years in that line.

He now owns two other stores
beside the Book Exchange, one in
West Virginia and "another in
Maryland.

In spite of a few unpleasant ex-- A
periences, Mr. Headlee admits that
Pitt students are the “most court-
eous students” with whom he has
ever done business. _

The greater part of the books
bought and sold through the ex-
change, Mr. Headlee adds, comes
from the medical students, due
probably to,its location near the
medical school. .

 
 

TCU Overhauls
Exam Schemes

FORT WORTH, Texas. (ACP)
-—An experiment is under way
in the department of physics at
T e x a s Christian University
which may well revolutionize
university examination proced-
ures.

It all began when Dr.'New-
ton Gaines made the discovery

‘that physics students do just as
much thinking, and disclose just
about the sameextent of their
knowledge, in devising a ﬁrst-
class examination as in taking
one. This led to the experiment.

“Most of my tests are coded
multiple choice,” sa ys‘ Dr.
Gaines. “When a student doesn’t
know the answer to one of the
questions, I give him the priv-
ilege of omitting it if he can
write a better or at least as good
a. question in its stead.”

Rules Set-Down Goverriingus  

Admissionto VA Hospitals 1 l 

For the beneﬁt of college veterans, the Veterans Administration
has set down rules governing admission to VA hospitals.

Top priority is given to those veterans requiring immediate
hospital attention because of an emergency condition. Such a rating
entitles a veteran to a bed at once. ’

Those veterans who have service-connected disabilities are also

eligible for prompt admission to

a VA hospital.

M

In the case of a veteran who has‘

a non-service-connected injury or
ailment, hospital care will be pro-
vided, if the veteran states he is

unable to pay for private medical
care, and if a bed is available in
a VA hospital.

Requests for admission are to
be made at the nearest VA office
or hospital.

Students Back Candidates
Despite University Policy

The University’s -oﬁicial policy of strict neutrality in political
matters isn’t stopping students from organizing clubs to back can-
didates for the ’48 presidential election.

.A group of undergraduates led by Bob Dickey, Frank Manella,
Marty Lubovsky and William Gittings recently announced the for-
mation of a “Stassen for President” club on campus.

The local group is aﬂiliated with the Pennsylvania committee
Qof the

campaign.
In a prepared release Lubovsky

‘cited Mr. Stassen as “the only one

of the men mentioned as candi-
dates for the Presidency who can
provide the vigorous leadership of
the center that is so badly needed
in the world today.”

The “Stassen for Presiden "
club thus becomes the second stu-

Threat to Cut
Grid Hopefuls

If there is any safety in num-
bers, the Pitt football situation
should be quite safesnext fall.
About 80 hard-working candi-
dates are now struggling for
berths.

Although Mike Milligan recent-
ly threatened to cut the roster,
he relented and decided to let the
weak. fall where they may. All
hopefuls will be allowed to stay
until May 8, when spring drills
end.

The more promising will be in-
vited to thesfall camp at Bedford
in September. This group will in-
clude several men who are par-
ticipating in other sports this
spring.

Such stalwarts as Cecconi, Raz-
zano, and Matich, on the baseball
team, and Bobby Lee and Chuck
Thomas,» on the track team will
take a Bedford “vacation.”

Milligan andhis aides are un-
usually optimistic over the tackle
position. This line slot is proba-
bly in better shape today then it
has been at any time since the
golden days of Pitt football.

Bob Plotz and Mike Boldin, last
season’s regulars, have returned.
there is a heavy
group of replacements behind
them. Jim Delong and Sam Had-
dad have had experience in the
slot. Ralph Short has been mov-
ed from center to tackle.

Of the freshmen Nick Bulkovic
has drawn a big share of praise
from onlookers. Pat Galino, Joe
DeFede, and Paul Block have
made the coaches take notice of
their work. ‘

Unbeaten Educators
Take on Tech PiKA's
For lntermural Title

G-uy Lateano sends his unbeaten Educators onto the Sta-
dium hardwood tonight where the Pitt IM champs tangle with
Carnegie Tech’s PiKA’s for the intermural championship of
Oakland. Composed entirely of Panther varsity gridders, the

order.

Two factors, however, may help
the Tech IM titlists. Since the Ed-
ucators must participate in after-
noon football
drills. they may,
be rusty at the
8 p. In. tip—oif.
Then, too, the
Tartans favor
a deliberate
style of play
which could
slow up the
fast break of-
fense of the
Educators.

lLast month
the Phi Eps
stymied Lateano’s quintet for three
periods before Carl DePasqua and
Tony Razzano solved their slow
play. This duo coupled with Cen-
ter Ralph Short and Guard Lindy
Lauro is expected to lead the Ed-
ucator, assault.

The word assault» is used cor-
rectly. Usually the Educators pre-
game warm up includes ripping
T-shirts from their teamamtes’
shoulders. L

. Barring the Educator’s path is
Ralph Sill, six feet, four inch

Wasciekols  
Loss Weakens
Panther Bats

.Pitt’s chances for a winning
baseball season were dealt a se-
vere blow last week when right-
ﬁelder Johnny Wascieko left the
squad.

Wascieko said he was with-

drawing because of a trouble-'

somely-sore arm. He also explain-
ed * that, because he is married

and has a child, the would have to

devote more time to earning a
living.

The loss of Wascieko substracts
considerable batting punch from
the Panther lineup. He led the
team in hitting last season with a
‘.415 average.

Mitterling Changes

Johnny T was never a distance
hitter, and although, right-hand-
ed all the way, manyof his hits
were push s"rW‘~~ ‘nto right ﬁeld.

When Wascieko informed Coach
Ralph Mitterling that hepwas giv-
mg up baseball, he made a thor-
oughly distrought man of “a con-
tented one. With‘ the exception of
one or two positions, Mitterling’s
lineup seemed solidly set.

Now the Old Sarge has to shuf-
ﬂe his deck and look for new
aces. _

‘_ Six Vie for Spot

The right ﬁeld problem, sadly
enough, has come rolling in on’

the heels of a completely confus- .

ed situation in left field. As mat-
ters stand, the regular leftﬁelder
must be chosen from a. list of six
potentials. ' ‘ A
4 The ﬁeld includes Frank Pa-
pariello, Frank Valencik, Frank
Susko, Jackie Snyder, Tony Raz-
zano, and Bimbo Cecconi. Shake
up the hat and draw a lot--yo,u’1l
know as much as the next fellow.

Liked--Shortstop

By Myron Kopelman
Jackie Snyder is a baseball
player with a tradition to up-
-hold. In the early part of the
century Beggs Snyder put the
family name on the sports pages
by playing a lot of shortstop

in the old Federal League.

Now the younger Snyder is see-
ing that it stays there.

Jackie played shortstop last year

for Ralph Mitterling’s Panthers

and compiled a .360 batting aver-
age. His talents, furthermore, have
been good enough to attract feeler
bids from the Pirates, Dodgers,
and Redsox. .
Raised on Baseball

But 24-year-old» Jackie has been
a long time developing those tal-
ents. , '

“My dad had me taking work-
outs since the day ’I was big
enough to carry a bat,” he recall-
ed. “I was raised on ground balls
and batting practice.

“Dad had it planned from the
beginning that I wouldbe an in-
ﬁelder,” said Jack in the manner
of a man who has been plotted
against. “His plans panned out,
too. « '-
Rather Hit Than Field

“But it really doesn’t matter to
me what position I play as long
as I get to bat, I’d rather hit than
ﬁeld any day.”

Jackie’s first taste of an organ-
ized league came in 1939 when
he was but 15-years-old and in
eighth grade. Prothonotary Wil-
liam H. , Frasher, knowing what
goes intobeing a regulation pro-
thonotary, decided that he ought
to have a club.

So -he formed the Frasher Base-
ball. Club. Beggs Snyder became
manager and with son Jackie in
the inﬁeld formed a father-son

combination that lasted four years.

Met - Barnes Before

In its ﬁrst season the Frasher
Club beat Rosedale for the Key-
stone League title. Playing for
Rosedalet was Art Barnes-who is
presently teaming up with Snyder
as the Panthers’ double play com-
bination. '

Eight years "later in 1947, the
Dormont club of the Greater Pitts-
burgh League defeated Oakmont
for the _v title. In Dormont’s lineup
were Snyder. In Oakmont’s lineup

c was Barnes.

This June Snyder will be grad-
uated, having studied metallurgi-

.1 cal engineering, and he hopes. to

make his ﬁnal season as big as
last year’s. 1 His only difficulty at
the present isthat he has dropped
from 170 pounds in recent weeks

. to 155.1

“iI\”m married, you know, and

' you lose‘ a lot of weight walking

‘around in the middle of the night
with a ﬁve-month-old baby girl,”

. he explained.  ,

Charley Varro, Farrell sopho-
more, who may end up as Pitt’s
first string catcher this Spring,
was out a year ago but had to be

passed up, because a heavy _schol-
U astic schedule kept him from mak-

ing the away from home games.

PACE IN $90375  

Ranked as Pittsburgh’s out-
standing sports ﬁgure, Dr. Suther-
land coached football at the Uni-
versity from 1924 through 1938.
He came to his alma mater after
ﬁve very successful seasons at La-
fayette University. ,

His resignation in 1939 followed
a drastic de-emphasis policy. At
the time, Dr. Sutherland insisted
he would “never send a team out
on the ﬁeld which didn’t have at
least a chance of winning.”

Served In Navy

He served as a Lt. Commander
in the Navy from 1942 until his
discharge in 1945. Last fall he
steered the Pittsburgh Steelers to
the most successful season in the
history of the club.

Prior to taking over the Steeler
post in 1946, he had coached the
Brooklyn Dodgers during 1940 and
1941.

At a student, athlete, teacher,
and coach, Dr. Sutherland ‘passed
a quarter of a century at the Uni-
versity where he became famous
as the originator of the,“Suther-
land Scythe.” He was affection-
ately called “Old Stone Face” and
“The Silent Scot.”

Enter Golden Era.

Under his expert tutelage the
University entered the Golden
Era in football. Year after year
his teams.met the best in the
country, and ten times the Pan-
thers ﬁnished amonglthe ﬁrst ten
teams nationally.

In 1928-30-33-37 they played,’

Most Famous Grid Coach

(Continued from Page 1)

in the New Year’s Day Bowl game
at Pasadena, California. Ten All-
Americans were chosen from his
single wing, power-emphasis elev-
ens. His teams won 111 games,
lost 20, and tied 12.

The 1938 “Dream Backﬁeld” of
Chickerno, Cassiano, Stebbins, and
Goldberg won national promi-
nence for the University.

Best In November

The Panthers had a habit of
picking up steam as the season
progressed and by November were
nearly unbeatable. Over the 15-
year-span they lost only four
games in November. W & J (1924),
Ohino State (l930),_ Carnegie
Tech (1938), and Duke (1938)
share this distinction.

Dr. Sutherland entered Pitt in
1914. He was a large bony Scotch-
man, who spoke with a thick
burr and who, at 25, was consid-

erably older than. his classmates. R

The late Joe Duff, then coach
of the Panthers, induced‘ “Jack”
Sutherland to play guard on his
ﬁne eleven which lost only to
W & J, 13-10. It was the only los-
ing contest in which Dr. Suther-
land played at Pitt.

Named All-American

Through the next three years,
1915-16-17, hec ontributed ster-
ling performances on Glenn S.

(Pop) Warner’s undefeated and_

untied teams. Walter Camp select-
ed him as a guard on the 1917‘
All-American eleven.

Addition of Word ‘Sitter’ to Family Life
Indicates Trend Away From Self Reliance

DALLAS, Texas——“Sitter is theo

only new word added to family
life in the last two years, declar—
ed Dr. Margaret Mead, well
known ethnologist, in an address
here at Southern Methodist Uni-
versity.

The advent of the sitter is a
good indiczition of what is hap-
pening to the American family,
she continued. That is, it can no
longer take care of its own sick
or young, as did the families of
the past.

And yet, in spite of this, fam-
ilies of today are expected to meet
'their own economical and emo-
tional crises, she continued.

America is the only country
which expects a young couple to
start marriage on nothing. ac-
cording to Dr. Mead.

Women Vote
Tits Friday

(Continued from Page 1)

Miss Nelan is hoping for a heavy
turnout because she believes that
an “interested electorate is reﬂect-
ed later in successful. government.”

Tomorrow night the ﬁrst of
three days of election business gets
underway when Senior Court con-
ducts the traditional clearing
house. The ‘second step will be
taken. Thursday night when ap-
proximately 125 nominees attend
the Nominees Banquet at the
Schenley Hotel.

Then, on Friday. the girls will
vote.

Clearing house is just what the
name implies. It is a session of
cross—checking to eliminate the
possibility of one student being
nominated to appear on a ballot
for .more than one position in a
major organization. Nominees in
minor organizations are also
checked according to the point
scale system to prevent the over-
loading of any one individual.

When the checking is com-
pleted, individuals will be con-
tacted by phone, informed of their
nomination, and invited to the
banquet Thursday night. Persons
nominated competing for more
than one oﬂice are ‘given a choice
of position at this time.

“Liggett & Myers buy the middle leaves . . . it’s the best
