queen that is a

Yesterday was the day. At a short ceremony in the ‘Stoogent
Health suite, at 2 o’clock, Miss Tizzie Roe Priss, E41, was unwrapped
for the ediﬁcation of well over 7000 holders of schedule caras. Tea
taken. Miss Priss exclaimed that she had been taken, too——by surprise.
Chosen in ‘a democratic poll, Miss Priss will compete with several
other non-commissioned fortune seekers, Ab-
dul Florio, Batty Eggnog, Garish’ Floormeih,
and Fulia Lemons. _,

Miss Priss is an active last lap woman, in 
depressed sort of way. In her freshman year
Miss Priss was the intellectual leader. of"two
or three football riots. It was at this time that
she earned the title “Knife ’em in the back,
Nellie.” She took this tribute wi.th becoming
modesty. Each year she has become more mod-
est. Sometimes before and after meals. ,

In her sophomore year Miss Priss was h.in.d-
ered a bit. For three consecutive archery class
meetings,
dulled her arrows. The latter part of this point-
less year Miss Priss was conﬁned to her home
because her lip rouge smacked of taint.

Last year iound our heroine rejuvenating" the
Medical School. Dr. Sliverpuss Scalpel, enig-
ma of anatomy, described. her as the best cad-
aver of all time. “When they took her away,
the boys were all cut up about it,” he slobbered.
Later, summing up his courage, he spat.

In her senior year the late Miss Priss was

tee. a member of iviorbid Bored. recruited stu-

To illustrate her point, Mi.ss Slush
called into the office Hilclegrade Q.

owsky is a short. winsome girl, with
:1 winning smile, buck teeth, and :1

Miss Smi.thanowsky’s ribs. "Tilt!

precatingly, and crawled out of the

Miss Slush then called in Lydia

think. that this girl. had never e\"c:1

drove down to Camp Dix with Elliott, and he showe’
me all the fine work being done by those fine young
men just entering the army. We
watched them dri'.ling for almost hall’

We  their bunk room.’-;Aand the
mess hall, and we watched two of
the nicest young men cleaning out the
stables. I sometimes think weought
to be very grateful for the splendid
work these young men are doing to
build up our national defense. The
President is quite proud of them. I
think we should all pray"that none
of them ever really have to go to

vote Democratic war. The Army unii’orm_s'_ are so
natty. I was rea-ly surprised.

Buzzic has a bad cold. Young children always have
so many sicknesses, especially when, they are young,
although I am sure that most parents don't complain
about taking care of them, since they really can’t help
it, and I think the kiddies feel just as bad about it as
the’ grownups, when you consider that they have‘ to
stay indoors, and it does get so nice outside in'Wash-

' Enlargement of the Women’s
Athletic associatiorrs program to
include intercollegiate competition
has brought, about the cancellation
of all varsity sports scheduled, di-
rector of athletics James Saggin
announced today. i ﬂ
The decision was made, _says
Waggin, after 44 robust WAA girls
chasedhead football coach Charley
Growsér, off the practice field, and
began "running through light scrim-

, 3118388. . The WAA squad was._head~

~’ fi elcl ‘runner. * w ' “ -

‘ “Somebody-jupst toldth-cm they

had equal rights,” moaned Naggin,
-frantically tearing

, up his desk
blotter. : b V‘ H . 
The .-new’ “W,AA program includes

dintercolleglaite football, basketball,

volleyball, baseball, and interpre-
tive dancing. The WAA. gridders
will meet  Smith, ‘Vassar, Smith,

'\/'a.~:.sar, Vassar, E-Smith and I-‘CW. D"

nutrition, house maid’s knee, and 5
o?c-lock shadow. Miss Yogic sneer-
ed derisively, “Yah, ihey’re scares‘.
01' us,” when informed of the diffi-
culty in schedL1lj.ng games.

With all varsity teams automa-
tically eliminated, it is believed that
director Draggin will automatical-
ly resign. His successor has as yet
not been named, but will probably
be chosen from among the defeated
candidates for Senior Queen.

New coach of the WAA football
team is Dr. Betsy Blearick, former
all-American throwback. Dr.
Blearick sees a bright future for
her girls. “What a pass defense
they’ll have,” she chortled. “Wow!”

Only fear of WAA ofﬁcials is that

their new athletic program may be

hit by the draft. “Any number of
the girls may have to serve as
Army hostesses,” says Dr. Blearick,
“although some of them may be de-
ferred because of dependent moth-
ers, fathers, chi—-because of de-
pendents.” ’ L
The new setup brought only
cheers from- intramural director
Jimmy "Butts.  “Yippee,”’ he howl-

-ed,‘ “Now we can use the Cathedral

gym.”
