5GB Settles Ring Dispute

by JOAN EASTBOURN

The Student Government Board
iSGBi voted 4-2 to contract L. G.
Balfour Co. and.Joston"s. Inc.. to
provide class rings to University
students. This was the final action
in a problem that had confronted
SGB since June. when the service
of the John Roberts Co. became
unsatisfactory.

Vanious proposals were coiisi-
deredibefore the final decision was

“made. One plan suggested by
Board member Terry Sadler was
to contract all three companies.
"1 like sticking to tradition." he
said, “but tradition promotes a
monopoly and monopoly implies

decreased service. If you add
x more competition you get better
service.“

Mary Bonach, representing the
Bookstore at the meeting, replied
that “the more rings you have the
less of a class ring you have.” In
addition, she said from a business
standpoint, it’s easier to deal with
only two companies.

On the other extreme. the idea
of having Balfour astthe only sup-
plier was voted down because of
the price of the ring—the highest
of the three — would make it un-
available to more students.

The combination of John Rob-
erts and_ Joston‘s was vetoed on
the grounds that Balfour has al-
ways lived up to their agreements
during the many years they have
served the University. The deci-
sion was made to make the Bal-

.guaranteed within

four ring and one of the lower-
priced rings available to students.
Questioned as to how responsi-
ble John Roberts’ service was,
Bonach said, “Up until May, their
service was good but then they be-
gan to fail in their agreements. In
their contract they accepted a def-
fered contract with students. One
student writing them was inform-
ed the plan was no longer avail-
able. They never told the Book-
store. That plan was one reason
they originally got the contract.”

In June. Roberts removed their
salesman from campus. Original-
ly. no charge was to be made for
resizing. "but students -were being
billed. Also deliveries which were
four weeks
were not delivered in time. The

i companyclaimed that their of-

fices were being moved from Ok-
lahoma to Texas.

In the Roberts plan. an offer of
up to three options was made for
a fee of $10. The options included
white gold. a starburst stone and

an insignia inscribed on the stone. 1

It was pointed out that since few
students order all three. the com-
pany was profiting on each -of
these rings.

The John Roberts ring was said
to be easier to order, the policy of
four week delivery and-of price
change notification within seven
days were also seen as advan-
tages.

At the end of the discussion. the
Board favored the programs of

American People ‘Misiniormed'

Balfour and Joston's. No ring de-
sign has yet been submitted by
Jostoiis. but an offer was made
by that company to have a repre-
sentative of the 'Art'Depart.ment
assist in designing the ring. There
is the possibility that the same or
nearly the same design as that
used by John Roberts will be used
by Joston‘s. The decision at this
meeting concerned only the busi-
ness plans of the three companies.

In other business. it was ex-
plained that the request for addi-
tional crosswalks on campus has
been delayed because the city has
not decided whether or not
Forbes and Fifth Aves. will re-
main one—way. '

Prominant  Writers
Attend Conference

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

"To be a serious writer." says
Maxine Kumin, "is perhaps the
loneliest profession in the world."

To novelist Tom McHale, writ-
ing is "an attempt to solve an in-
ner conflict through a subliminal
contact."

And to Dan Wakefield, his work
in both fiction and non-fiction fol-
lows no specific guidelines. The
end result is a blend of various
factors. -

This loneliness. this creation
through conflict, and the fruits of
creativity were among topics ex-
plored by Kumin, McHale. Wake-

Fonda Continues Campaign

by RICK EULER

Jane Fonda and the Indochina
Peace Campaign visited Pitts
campus last Tuesday and
pledged that they would continue
to campaign until the war is end-
ed.

The rally attracted such a large
crowed that. despite the threat of
rain. it had to be moved from the
Student Union pool room to the
lawn outside.

The crowd, which seemed some-
what listless for the greater part
of the‘ rally, came to life the in-
stant Fonda stepped up to the
mike. . '”

JANE FONDA: “Everyone should

know at this time what this nation
-‘is doing in-our names—in the name

of peace,” ' l “

.- '13
..

Fonda. her voice somewhat ras-
py. claimed that the McCarthy
era had frightened the American

public into silence. but that the

Civil Rights Movement had
changed this.

Fonda said that the American
people. at present. have “taken
their place in history to try to stop
criminal and illegal. racist and
genocidal war."

She blasted the Nixon adminis-
tration for itscontinued bombing
of residential areas in North Viet-
nam. She also went into some de-
tail as to the horrors of napalm
and poison gases.

"President Nixon's campaign
slogan-Now More Than Ever‘---
l couldn't figure out what it

meant." Fonda stated. “But. now I
know its an absolutely‘ correct
slogan. It really means ‘.\ow
More War Than Ever Belore."‘
Tom Hayden. who also spoke on
the program. said that .\l'ixon
"wants to recreate the unhappi-
ness of. the fifties in the seventies
and the eighties." ' -
Both pleaded for the defeat of

’ Nixon, on the grounds that he him-

self had said that “Those who
have had a ‘chance for four years
and could not produce peace
should not be given another
chance.” I

Hayden added that. although the
movement was politically non-
partisan. it did believe that Mc-
Govern‘s views would end the war
but that .\'ixo_n.‘s would not.

.l-lolly Near. a folksinger. and

George Smith. _ari_“e,x-‘Green Beret_‘_

 

and POW. were the other two fea-
tured speakers. Near. opening
the program. .condemned the
"facelessness which allows us to
not know who these people are.“

Smith agreed that Americans
have a misconception of the Viet-
namese people. He used himself
as an example, claiming that he
had been lied to at Fort Bragg in
1963 before he was sent to Viet-
nam.

The concert was attended by
Pittsburgh collegiates and youth

groups from the Somerset, Wash-,

schools.
The picketers were given tick-

ets. both prior to the concert and i

just after it started, but they were
kept out by plain-clothed Pitts-
burgh municipal policemen and
Nixon’ campaign workers, all
wearing upside down Nixon but-
tons.

Dunne explained, 31 did not
know how the policemen were
hired or paid, because the whole
thing was handled out of Wash-
ington." He’was "fairly certain,"
however. that the officers were
off duty.

The protest was called by the

Jane Koons and Stephanie Vale-
ticli began petitioning last Friday
because they find that "the food

hours are inconvenient to many
students.

Koons said the campaign grew
out of a meeting of the Pitt Ten-

Scott Spadafore, president of
the Men's Dormitory Council. was
the first student to sign the peti-
tion. Spadafore said he favored
the referendum for several rea-
sons. Among them he cited that

‘students shouldn't have a man-

students cannot make every meal
and are forced to "rearrange
their academic schedules" to per-

thing, I believe in the presence of
the Muse . . . if only as a creative
force," Kumin said.  . . I have a
horror of being purposefully ob-
scure. I just want to be clear and
fresh in image and thought.”

Handling poetic images. she con-
tinued, is ’a matter of accuracy
and specificity.

Kumin, both a poetry and fic-
tion writer, has had her work pub-
lished in numerous magazines,
among them Harper’s, The New
Yorker, and Atlantic. Her most
recent novel is entitled The Ab-
duction. Up Country, a collection
of poems with pastoral themes,
will soon bring her number of poe-
try volumes to four. J

Tom McHale, author of Princi-
pato and Farragan’s Retreat, told

plan. "The plan would contribute
little which is presently unavail-
able in the College. The rational
behind the plan was that a student
who had suffered some personal
difficulty of an extreme sort. a
difficulty which resulted in a D or
F, could have the grade removed
from his record. However, under
the present system a distressed
student can explain his‘ difficul-
ties to me and, if their concerns
are sufficient. I would grant a
withdrawal.“

Pasek saw the present system
as one in which the student is "un-
duly forced to lay his problem on
the table for administrative au-
thorities.” Pasek indicated a de-
sire to reintroduce the bill at a
later date.

the audience of approximately 25
that his start in writing came "in
part from being an incurable ro-
mantic susceptible to fantasies
about writers." At that time. he
said, no one spoke of writing as a
profession and largely connotat-
ed it with unemployment.

For McHale, “writing is an at-
tempt to exorcise some of the
problems of hyprocrisy found in
the world." ‘A case in point; he
said, was the writing of Farra-
gan’s Retreat. The events of 1968.
he recalled. drove him to write a
"politically conscious novel.”

McHale’s third novel is expect-
ed to be completed soon.

Professional writing in the form
of magazine journalism was dis-
cussed by Wakefield, a contribut-
ing editor to Atlantic. In addition
to his non-fiction books, An Island
in the City, The Addict, and Super-
nation at Peace and War, he has
written a novel, Going All the
Way, with another soon to be pub‘-
lished. .

Wakefield stressed the differ-
ence between handling non-fiction
material creatively and merely
handling it competently. In shar-
ing anecdotes of both the perils
and pleasures of researching
stories, Wakefield claimed he of-
ten follows the credo of writer
Joan Didion, who advised “hang-
ing around a while and make a
few friends."

The conference. sponsored by
the Department of English and the
Office of Student Publications,
was co-directed by Lee Gutkind
and Robert Papinchak, Assistnat
Professors of English.

CAS Cabinet Focuses

On Communication

by RICK INFVANTE

Ron Eskin, president of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
Cabinet, outlined the functions and
the limitations of the Cabinet at
the first CAS Cabinet meeting.

The Cabinet primarily functions
"as an outlet for student aca-
demic concerns." It delivers
much of the input decided upon by
the CAS Council.

Emphasizing the “channels of
communication” that need to be
established between the various
departments and student liasons,
Eskin appointed student represen-
tatives from the Cabinet to meet
with department’ heads and dis-
cuss the possibilities of student
delegates being present at depart-
mental meetings.

SGB Settles Ring Dispute

{Continued from Page I)

SGB has acquired 100 reserved
seat tickets to the Pitt-Penn State
game on Nov. 25, Thanksgiving
weekend. The tickets will be avail-
able to students for $7: the fee in-
cludes the bus trip to and from
State College. They will be sold at
the Student Union Ticket Office.

It was brought to the attention
of the Board by Bill Markus, As-

sistant Dean of Student Affairs,"

that a recent court ruling barred
the city of Denver from forcing
the University of Colorado to col-
lect an amusement tax on social
events open only to their students.
SGB decided to look into the pros-

pect of contesting the thousands-

of dollars paid to the city each
year in amusement taxes by the
University for movies. concerts
and athlet_ic events.

Allocations were made to the
Hill Education Project, Men's
Glee Club, and Skyscraper Engi-
neer for their regular budgets and
to WPGH for a transmitter study.

SGB also voted to contribut_e $5,-
000 to procure the service of a
second campusibus. This will be
added to money from the Univer-

sity to total the $24,000 necessary
to operate a bus for one year. It
would possibly have an alternate
route to cover campus areas not
included on the present route.
The Board anticipates that the ad-
dition will enable more students
to use the Trees Hall parking lot
and alleviate some of the conges-
tion of Oakland parking. .

An Executive Board for cam-
pus publications is being formed.
It will be ‘composed of two mem-
bers for each of the eight campus
publications. Any interested stu-
dent may submit his name to the
Student Government office.

. The SGB was made aware
through reports from
members of the relatively serious
situation involving security of
students on campus. It was sug-
gested that either Dr. Moye’s
Student Affair-s Office or an ad
hoc committee investigate the
problem.

Moye further suggested that the
issue be taken to the Housing Of-

Board member Sadler stated,
“It seems like campus security
is more concerned with the safety
of University property than stu-
dent safety.” SGB decided to at-
tempt to work together with the
campus police without interfer-
ring in the force’s internal affairs.

The Program Committee would
like to contract Norman Mailer
for a speaking engagement on
campus but the Allocations Com-
mittee denied funding. Pat Kab-
lach, representing Allocations,
said her committee is trying to
discourage short-term planning

‘by the campus organizations.

"Events always seem to come off
better when students know about
them ahead of time.” SGB is rec-
ommending, however, that Mail-
er’s appearance be funded, there-
fore, reconsideration will be ne-
cessary for the Allocations Com-
mittee. The engagement is tenta-
tively scheduled for Oct. 31 at 8

At that time Concilla was told

"I went to Vietnam happily in
1963," Smith explained. "I didn‘t
consider them (the Vietnamese)
as men with families."

Smith said that the stories of
atrocities committed against
POW’s were exaggerated. He ad-
mitted that there were “probably
isolated cases on both sides," but
added that he felt the North Viet-
namese generally treated their
POW’s better than the South Viet-
namese, given their resources.

Major Elias, one of the three
prisoners recently released by
North Vietnam, was also criti-
cized by Smith. He said that al-

rid Save The Queen

 .This year's homecoming stresses the theme of ‘Pride in
cradition.’ In keeping with this theme. the Pitt News l'S.S’pOIl-'
oring Mr. Robert Ging as‘our candidate for the position of
Homecoming Queen.

i In the past several schools have elected a male homecom-

ng queen as a joke, or as an attempt to embarrass the propon-
jnts of a traditional homecoming. We do not attempt to jest
‘r to embaI"r‘ass anyone with this move.
 . Rather, in keeping the theme of ‘Pride in Tradition’, we
would like to nominate a candidate who embodies the noble
rladitions of democratic liberalism which have formed the
asis of our system of governmentandour educational system.

 Mr. Ging’s activities as a student legal aid counsellor.
"th in the University and in the community, are evidence of
"is...-.commitment to the bettermentof mankind. Through his
rjiting and his activism Mg. Ging has attempted to present
is-.:views in a responsible andeffective manner.

 He has demonstrated a genuine concern for the direction
,rid.goals of the University through his activities with the Pitt
ews and the Student Government service committees.

He’-was responsible for the founding of the Free Press
which he hoped would provide students with increased oppor-
unities to express themselves before the University community.
-' As the Homecoming Queen should be a distinguished
,7 ember of the University community, a person who has exhib-
dexceptional talent, and a person of whom the University
fe-specially’ proud, "we urge support. for Mr. Ging‘s candi-

Laissez-Faire  

   

llllllllllllllllllllllﬁ

by JOHN METCALFE

Harry Blandig just left my office suite. He had
stopped by to explain his latest scheme.

Aside from his political commitments. Harry
has lately taken to smoking a pipe that looks like
it was made in a high-school shop class. It must
have been manufactured on a Lathe—it is more com-
plicatedlthan the plumbing on an average auto-
mobile air-conditioning system. The pipe itself
was not terribly expensive. but the herbs he smokes
in it do tend to cost a little more than ordinary
tobacco.

As a result. Harry has been obligated to invent
a new product. which he hopes to market if all
goes well.

The new thing. or device. or ornament. is a little
hard to define. so I'll let Harry put it his own
way. '

"Actually. I‘m not sure if it's a garment. or a
cosmetic. because there‘s been a lot of inspec-
tion and controversy lately about cosmetics. I
guess what it is is really -a garment with politi-
cal implications.

"Maybe you don’t understand that. You don't
look like you do.

“I truly believe there is a market for my
product. Since Women‘s Lib.‘ come along. even
the underwear the chicks are wearing is a polit-
ical issue. For instance, if a broad goes around
with nose-cones up around her shoulders, you
just know she must be a Republican. Most likely
she'd rather have Goldwater. but she'd settle for
Nixon. ’ A

On the other hand. you've got the girls that
need all the support they can get, but they do
without it. so everybody can see they‘re liber-
ated.

"That‘s okay. But not everybody fits into these
neat little categories. For instance. what about
the ladies who only look like they‘ve burned their
bras? They have all the discomfort of that odd
garment and none of the comforts of being recog-

"I cant do anything for them. but . ..

"I can help another group. and I truly be-
lieve there are enough of them to make the pro-
ject economically worthwhile.

"I"m talking about the girls who burned
their bras. and nobody noticed. They have been
dealt a short hand by Nature. and they have no
way to express their_true beliefs. but I can
help them. ,

"I have invented what I call the EverBob. It
will allow even those women who have found
their natural endowments a little skimpy to wobble
with the best of them. _

“Basically. the device resembles a brassiere.
However. it is actually a pair of approximate
spheres made of a special silicone jelly. suspend-
ed from the shoulders. Each sphere has a stimu-
lated nipple. scarcely detectable from the real
thing. in a realistic and visible location. The jelly
wobbles. by actual test. at least as much as the
genuine article. '

“On stairs it‘s incredible.

"Instead of cursing Nature. liberated ladies
who utilize the Everbob will be able to protest
artificial restrictions just as well as those who
need such restrictions. This is political action
on the grand scale.

"I plan to go into production as soon as I
get a few more cash orders. You wouldn't be-
lieve who some of my clients are."

I had to interrupt Harry.

"Do you mean you're selling these things.
and you've never actually made one?“

"Don’t worry. When the market allows, I'll
fill all my orders. Meanwhile. just dreaming about
the EverBob ought‘a be enough for those ‘broads.
It'sfaith."

Harry Blandig has been a dear friend of mine
for a long time. but I'm beginning to wonder.

 

/

.tors.l We have

nized as conservatives at heart.

I must register the strongest
complaint regarding the continu-
ed deterioration of Trees Hall
Pool. The pool is, for all prac-
tical purpose. no longer a Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh facility but
a municipal swimmnig pool
which excludes Pitt faculty and
students. On one evening. for
example. not only was Leisure-
Learn operating but high school
swimming teams _and junior
high school teams. Pitt faculty
and students were "allowed"
less than one-third of the pool
which was impossible for any use
except standing in" one place
while a mass of people slammed
ipto one another. The diving area
was closed—except to the high
school teams.

Leisure-Learn with its obvious
community public relations as-
pect is certainly defensible. How-
ever. the use of the pool by school
teams and a number of other
groups is not at all tolerable. This
situation is compounded by. the
absolute disregard for posted
"recreational hairs.” We can
never depend upon the pool being

’ open. It is closed—or restricted-—

at the slightest whim of its opera-
less. than even
chance that the pool will be open
when it is supposed to be. The
common experience is to come to
Trees only to be turned away with
some silly and flimsy excuse.
By contrast. for three years at
the University of Illinois. not
once did this occur. The hours

for staff and students were long- ‘

er and never cancelled and the
pool was for University use.

If Trees Hall Pool is going to
become a municipal facility, I
suggest it seek its financial sup-
port there and not from the Uni-
versity. If, however, it is to be a
part of the University then it
must serve the University first.
We cannot hope to meet the

-needs of the high schools in the
area, boy scout troops, or as i_t
1.,-now appears, practically the en-

paper."

Maybe there was too much oregano in his pipe.

Letters to the Editor

tire city of Pittsburgh. If we are
to carry through with the prac-
tice of Trees Hall Pool we must
then open the Library to the
public, all classes, all laborator-
ies, in short, all our facilities.

There must be a policy de-
cision made soon. The University
serves its own community. It
cannot hope to serve the entire
city. Somehow we are going to
have to convince the people at
Trees‘_ Hall Pool that they too
serve the University.

Sincerely.

Letter to the Editor
Alstadt

Dear Editor: _

I was extremely dismayed to
read in the October 2. issue of
the Pitt News an article written
by McGovernite Barry Parson
that was filled\ with hap-hazard
reasoning, half-truths, and per-
sonal innuendos that have no
place in any newspaper. By
printing this article you not only
exhibited gross editorial irrespon-
sibility, but also violated an agree-
ment among the Pitt Young Re-
publicans, the Young Democrats
and the Pitt News to provide a
fair‘ and equal presentation of
both’ sides of the issues in the
1972 Presidential campaign-.,

I realize that you and a major-
ity of your staff are sympathetic
to the”McGovern candidacy and
I respect your opinions as such.
However, when you present
"news stories" that blatantly ex-
press the anti-Nixon sentiments
of their authors(e.g. your cover-
age of Ed Cox’s visit). you vio-
late the basic rules of journal-
ism. When you promise to cover
the campaign fairly and then give
an inordinate amount of coverage
to the McGovern candidacy, you
discredit your own integrity
as well as the integrity of your

. W .’ 
- ,g_.-. V. --

As editor of the Pitt News you
have a responsibility to all seg-
ments of the University Commun-
ity. You also ought to express a
sense of journalistic propriety
rather than cater to special inter-
ests. You have not yet fulfilled the
obligations of your position. Isn‘t
it about time you did? '

Yours truly.
Lynn J. Alstadt

 

Note: The Pitt’ News invites all
members of the University com-
munity to submit opinion columns
to the Pitt News.

We feel it is our duty to create a
forum for student opinion. Mr. Par-

I son's contribution was _printed in

keeping with this policy.

As to unequal coverage, our re-
porters have been refused admit-
tance to the Republican functions
we have have attempted to cover
(e.g. Ed Coxrap session, Youth for

. Nixon Benefit Rock Concert).

The project organized by Pitt

consideration during the summer
months. and only approved this

A system has been developed
for the process of recycling cans.

empty food cans in a designated
spot. and from there students paid
on a work-study basis take over.

Their job is removing the
outer labels of the cans. crushing

students.

The next step was taken care
of by Jim Mook, of the County
Health Department. He utilized
the services of the Vulcan Metal
Company in picking up the cans
and taking them to be recycled,
thus completing the process.

Those working in EA/ZPG al-
though displeased with some as-
pects of the food service said: "We
are very appreciative of the co-
operation we‘ve received from
Szabo concercing the recycling
project." said Dave. “and we hope
that it may establish a precedent
for similar action by other food
services on different campuses.“

ion before a small audience.

Coy, replacing scheduled speak-
er Dr. Jerry Falwell, absent due
to the death of a church member,
said: “According to their biblical
definition, women are industrial,
creative, and motivated. Their
priorities change their hus-
bands and family when married.”

With reference to marital in-
justice. he continued: "Women
should find confidence in that God
is women's asset." '

Sister Van Winkle. a retreat nun
who rarely makes public speaking

“I find recompense in God’s

- denunciation of mankind’s ignor-

ance to keep the existing condi-
tions of injustice,” she said.

- Coy claimed he'does not react

to women's liberation. "Break-

.i--downs are in the individual’s life

and it is there I look,” he said. _

. l'I think the freedom we're talk-

. I-ingabout is personal hangups that

we have inside and not social free-
dom," he continued. “Jesus says

. don’t-change society, change the

individual. ”

“I;iberation,” said Sister Van
Winkle, .“is good for the solidar-
ity of women, who can then better
understand themselves through
guidance of the scripture.” '

Convinced of the inequality of
the sexes, she stated, "Evil is in-

‘ stitutionalized in ‘the structures

No Chocolate Mess

 Candy—Coated Carmen Consumed

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Carmen, that perennial favorite
of the opera house. opened the

A Pittsburgh Opera's new season

last week in a candy coated pro-
duction which. while lacking im-
aginative originality in its ap-
proach. brought acceptable. and
in some instances even good vo-
cal art to the Heinz Hall stage.

Having been produced by our 10-
cal operacompany more times
than any other work that comes to
mind. Carmen’s music and libret-
to have accordingly been engrav-
ed upon the hearts and minds of
Pittsburgh opera "buffs" through
the years so that by this time.
many of them are weary of its fur-
ther performance.

Despite this, and the fact that
the opera itself. contains so many
'cliches of 19th century Roman-
anticism, its captivating melodies
and sunny freshness leave most
audiences satisfied whether the
performance in question is either
good or bad.

‘zatiana Troyanos was a. most
’convincing Carmen. with a rich.

.’“ dark. warm tone which triumphed

in those dramatic moments upon
which the opera hangs; the renun-
ciation of Don Jose at Pastia‘s
tavern and the card scene were
perhaps the more memorable in-
stances of such moments during
the evening. In addition to this.
‘ Troyanos exhibited a "stage pres-
ence" which greatly enhanced her
theatrical attempts and both her
~ dancing and general "sauciness“
‘added immeasurably to her_ gen-
eral success in the role. '

Jean Bonhommetas Don Jose
was satisfactory .but not terribly - -

outstanding.-He scooped for notes
tlrrjughout the performance and

oughly satisfying and Bonhomme
showed much sensitivity of ex-
pression throughout.

The role of Carmen’s second
lover, Escamillo, was fulfilled by
Robert Bickerstoff in an unfor-
tunately “throaty” manner. His’
tone was heavy and his higher
notes seemed forced, containing
very little sense of tonal light-
ness. Ellen Shade performed Mi-
caela’s role with competency and
thoughtfulness but s-hrieked rath-
er than sang in many of her act
three passages.

With memories of the past ine-
diocrity of our local operatic
chorus in mind during the course
of its choral attempts during the
evening. a sense of improvement
was evident. especially among
the tenors. While the opening chor-
us was excruciating anemic. the
blend of the group and its sense
of balance showed at least a sense
of familiarity with the music.
Such a sense of familiarity should
come as no surprise; after all.

~. this was Carmen's 12th produc-

tion in our city.

Dr. Karp‘s tempi were very of-

ten on the slow side. The habanera
of act one lacked the syncopation

which it certainly requires; rtath-.

er than bringing out the accom-
paniment of the orchestra during
the course of the piece. the direc-
tor held it back until it could hard-'
ly be heard. _ . .

When hearing the orchestra in

the pit during operatic.endeavors.
such as these, one senses a muf-‘

fled orchestral sound throughout
the. main floor of the hall, it is
most readily -evident below and I

-CHARLES OPTICAL commv   

suggest that the construction of
the pit be examined with this

thought in mind.

Sets and scenery left much to be
desired throughout the entire pro-
duction. Much of it has the quality
of the background one would ex-
pect to find in an animated car-
toon feature. Needless to say. the
act three scene of a "wild. deso-
late place" was quite well done.
thanks mainly to the on stage
lighting effects. Costumes were
colorful and added greatly to the
festive character of much of the
action.

And so. another production of
Carmen under the auspices of our
local company has come and gone.
Unlike the New York production.
there were no new innovations or
changes in the Pittsburgh version.
The wealth of nice tunes was there
and so was the cast of memorable
characters. No fuss. I
just the "old fashioned" sort of
production we have come to ex-

ect in our city. And every was
’satisfied——well. almost everyone.

cy B. Strong. a Political Science
Professor. will officially get un-
derway.

The first course taught in the
new program will be a joint semi-
nar on selected topics to be offer-
ed by Professors Baler and
Strong. This seminar will be th_e
first in a sequence which fulfills
the course requirements for ina-
joring in Politics and'Philosophy.

The seminar will be for six cred-
its and will meet twice weekly for
two hours each-time. The enroll-
ment in this course is limited to
25 or 30 students and open pre-
dominantly to sophomores‘ and
those juniors who can meet the
requirements of the program by
the end of their senior year.

Students who register for" the
seminar should be seriously con-
sidering adopting the Politics and
Philosophy Program as their ma-
jor.

troduction to topics which are
both of empirical and philosophi-

, cal interest in contemporary so-
ciety. Classes will be conductedy
ina seminar fashion. with reports I‘
drawing on outside material by.

both the instructors and the stu-

= dents. -

_.According to Professor Strong
this program is intended to edu-

cate undergraduatesifor careers _

in public life, either. in the law pro-

V fessions, the government, com-

munity organization groups, or so-

Requirements will include a
number of short papers and it is
hoped that some outside "field
work" will become possible.

The undergraduate program will
include three types of courses.

‘during the student's sophomore
year. These seminars will be or-
ganized around specific topics.-
such as. obligation and punish-
ment. civil disobedience. corpora-’
tions and the public interest. and
the limits of law. All will be both
empirical and philosophical in
character.

Other required courses will in-
clude political science. philoso-
phy. and economics. These
courses are designed to give stu-
dents a common academic back-

Tuesday is next on our list

of days of the week and shows
to tell them by. Tues_day isn‘t
too hot a night either. though
it does have its bright spots.

First off is a three-way conflict

al counterpart to Archie Bunker,
is. working on eliminating her
fourth husband and finding a

the while insulting anyone and

a few new tricks added.
Little Joe got himself married.

 a father-to-be. and a widower.

all in the first 45 minutes of
the first show. Dan Blockerldied
this" summer. so Hoss is gone.

but Canary is back. and they‘re
adding Tim Matheson as an ex-
con the Cartwrights are going to
reform. (Relevance is in nowa-
days.) ,

Chanel 4’s Tuesday Movie of
the Week is promising more made-
for-T.V', shows. and judging by
the ones that have already been
on. they‘re going in for the spook-
ier things. This overlaps with
the New CBS Tuesday Night
Movies they apparently haven't
quite figured out what they're
going to do.

And while all this is going on.
there are two more doctor shows
to help all you latent hypochon-
driacs. The Bold Ones. which
is nothing but doctors this year.
is on at9p.m.

Everybody's favorite GP. Mar-
cus Welby. dispenses medicine
and paternal advice without
regard to race. creed. color or sex.
(By the way. for all you Wo-
men's Libbers out there. he’s
against abortion.)

And if you’re really news-mi'nd-
ed. Channel 11 has the NBC Re-
ports on at 10. Sure.

Wednesday's a pretty good
night—lots of variety. Paul Lynde

his exaggerated facial poses for
half-an-hour, the show is worth
watching. Carol Burnette, with
Harvey and Lyle and Vicki, is on
2, with basically the same format
as before-she is ageless. Adam-12
is on 11, if you’re really high on
“relevant” cops.

Then comes a hard choice.
.At 8:30. Carol Burnet is still

on 2. but 4 and 11 go to movies.‘

ABC is sticking to the comedy
route. while NBC goes for the
crime solvers—George Peppard
as Banacek. Mr. Super Pole;
Richard Widmark as Madigan.
a sort of humane Popeye (from
the French Connection); and
James Farentino
lion——About a detective who wants
a million dollars in advance for
solving a case, ‘but who offers
a money-back guarantee. Judging
from what's been on so far. .\'BC
is the best bet—~interesting with
entertaining plot-lines.

Medical Center comes on 2
sometime in the middle of all
this, and Dr. Cannon is still
getting emotionally involved with
any female patients and criti-
cizing all the males. Nothing
special there.

At 10. there’s different shows

a Iittlebit of something for
everyone. Mod Squad is on

against Flip Wilson Show,’ fol--

Then. to cap the evening off.
you can watch Owen Marshall

A  Now. it looks like it was inevitable all the time. Going into

the sixth week of a losing football teams schedule. letters have

' _started coming in asking for Carl DePasqua's balding head and
I am confronted with questions like. “When are you going to

ask for DePasqua to be fired?" at least thrice a week.

I wish Carl DePasqua was a mean. wicked man. I wish I
had never gotten so close to him. For now. my job is that much
harder—or is it? y '

Carl DePasqua is a kind. patient man. He has had a warm
smile and a firm handshake after all the adversity his team has
faced so far this year. But so what. His team hasn‘t performed
and he is paying the price. '

. Being a sportswriter who likes to think he
IS fair and intelligentenough to make some

'  profound insights, I think Carl has made a few '

. mistakes so far this year.

Iifeel he has been a might too conservative
' in forming his game plans. I feel he has made
misjudgements in evaluating some of his per-
sonnel. I think he should have chosen one quar-

 

DePASQU'A

But. I also firmly believe that he should not bare the blame
for Pitt‘s failure to win this year. , ~

First of all, DePasqua has lost four starters—those are the
starters who gained all that experience last year—for the sea-
son and three other starters for a total of seven games. People
don't want to hear this, however. Carl knows that. Not once this
year has be alibied for his team’s performance.

"I don’t like to use the injuries as an alibi." he said. "It
destroys the confidence of the people we have replacing the in-
jured players." . *‘

Maybe he has too much class to expect people to listen to
that stuff—-people who listened to it all last year and -for the last
ten years of Pitt football.

He has been forced to ‘use five freshman in starting posi-

" P tions so far this year. Again he makes no excuses.

But most of all, he refuses to speak against" an agreement
that has handcuffed him and his team. an agreement that has
had more to do with the Pitt demise than any fumble or inter-
ception in any game. That agreement would be the Big Four.

''I‘d rather not comment on that" is all he says.

Whether Carl DePasqua should be the Pitt head coach is
not up to me to decide..Thankfully, that’s why they invented
Chancellors and athletic directors. , P

Frank Kush almost took the Pitt job before DePasqua was
offered it. But Kush had the foresight to see ahead of time. Ru-
nlg has it that he called Pitt admissions and found out the bad
s ' he and reconsidered.

Frank Kush couldn‘t win under these conditions. a re—incar—

" tated Vince Lombardi couldn‘t win under these conditions. So

why is everybody crucifying Carl‘? _

y If alumni contributed as much effort into changing the sit-
uation as they supposedly devote to asking for a new coach,

Bemis declared. “With only

we’re a little premature to be

talking about the playoffs.”

A lean, friendly young man-.

Pitt’s cross country team. A

He began his career in seventh
grade by sprinting. The beginning
of his freshman year a friend in-

In tenth grade he tried out for
cross country and by his senior
year he was number one man on
the Upper St. Clair High School
team.

Why did Black choose Pitt?

1969 graduate of Upper St. Clair
High School, Black ran cross
country and track.

Is the college athletic program
at Pitt much different from the

high school athletic program?

“In high school you were pretty
sure of placing at least second.

College is different, the competi-
tion is greater. In college its more

of a personal thing to me.”

In the past three years Black
has had some tough luck, either
being sick or injured, but he has
