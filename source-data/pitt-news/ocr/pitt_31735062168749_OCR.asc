Note Academic Values

Of Chancellor - Elect

by DAN BOOKER 

The name and face of Col. Wesley,Wentz Posvar were
unknown to members of the University community until
the announcement last week that he would become 15th
chancellor of the University June 1. Members of the chan-
cellor search group were the only ones among faculty and
students who were familiar with the chancellor-elect.

Dr. Holbert N. Carroll, chairman of the Political Sci-
ence department, knows the Air Force office-r casually.

(Dr. Posvar serves at the Air Force Academy as chairman
of the Social Sciences Division.) “I have known Posvar as a political
scientist,” noted Carroll, who was a member of the chancellor search
group. He emphasized that he believed Dr. Posvar would be an “ex-
traordinary academian and administrator.”

Caroll rated Posvar as “a leading thinker and writer in the ﬁeld
of national security policy, strategic thought and systems analysis.”

After characterizing him as a, “strong academic,” Carroll re-
marked that he preferred not to think of Posvar as a colonel. “He
(Posvar) is known and respected by me as a ﬁrst-rate scholar with
strong academic values.” -

Dr. George Fahey, president of the Faculty Senate and another
member of the search group, echoed Carroll’s, statements. Fahey
noted that he also preferred- to address Posvar as “Doctor,” instead
of “Colonel.” It is only his job that requires a military title. con-
tinued Fahey, and Dr. Posvar is ‘
“basically a scholar.”

Dr. Richard Cottam, professor
of political science, is not fami-
liar with Dr. Posvar’s work, but
he commentedthat he had heard
favorable criticism of the chan-
cellor-elect’s dissertation which

is being made into a book.

In a September, 1962, issue of
Life magazine, Posvar was se-
lected as one of the 100 out-
standing young men in America.
In it’s article on Posvar, who is
now 41, Life quoted a senior of-
ﬁcer’s statement that “Posvar has
guided his staff (at the Academy)
to the concept of future officers
as a new breed of public ser-
vant.” The article was given the
title “A Rare Bird Colonel.”

Student Interest in Business

by MARY LYNN BROWN

The controversy over dwindling student careers in busi-
ness was taken yesterday to H. J. Zoffer, associate dean of
the Graduate School of Business, for discussion and com-
ment. “Anyone who says people are no longer interested in
business careers needs to deﬁne What people he’s talking
about,” replied Dean Zoffer, when asked about the articles

on business careers which re-

cently appeared in the Michigan
Daily and in Marketing Insights.
The articles contended that, al-
V though recruiters such as Rob-
V ert J. Cunning of General Elec-
tric claim, “We want enterpre-
‘neurs and thinkers who aren’t
satisﬁed with the status quo,”
students, particularly bright stu-
dents, aren’t choosing business
careers as in the past. Big cor-
porations seem to be waging an
intensive recruitment campaign
with leaﬂets. speakers, brochures.
and full page ads in student
newspapers.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Poor Attendence Plagues  
Presidential Election Forum“.

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Approximately 50 students at-
tended the Student Government
(SG) Election Forum yesterday
at noon’ in the SU Ballroom, al-
though. an air of optimism per-
vaded the occasion in the form
of 450 vacant chairs set up in an:

    

ticipation of a crowd.
Participating in the forum were

Tom Meisner, .ARA vice-presi-7
dential candidate; John Ruskay,
PPP presidentialdnominee; and
Ruskay’s vice-presidential run-
ning mate, Terry Hyman. ARA
presidential candidate Ken Fred-

would not have to be registered
in advance with the Office of
Men's Housing. Under the new
legislation two types of open
houses are possible. With a wom-
an chaperon and only one coun-
selor (previously two counselors
were needed), a full-scale open
house with women in the men’s
rooms is permitted. If a chaperon
is unavailable, a limited form of
the open house is still possible,
where women are allowed only
inthe lobby of each house. Only
one counselor, instead of two, is
needed for this kind of open
house and the new rules provide
that he will always be available.

‘Monday morning ” these rules
were submitted to Dean of Stu-
ident Affairs Helen Rush. She re-
ferred them to Dean of Men'Her-
ber McGibbeny who will hand
down his decision sometime next
week. If approved, the new so-

cial regulations will go into ef- ‘

feet in September.

Commenting on the new legis-
lation, Council President Thomas
Meisner explained, “These
changes are smallbut signiﬁcant.
In the past broader and more
impracticle changes were pro-
posed. These are more practical,
and if" approved, they would

While a men’s’.Judicial Board
was discussed at last week’s
meeting, the actual idea for the
Board is not a new one. It was
actually proposed last term as a
means for allowing men students

to have more voice in the mat- _

ters vitally affecting them. Since
that time, MDC has been work-
ing on a set of by-laws for the
new organization through Sena-
tor Tom Glasgow and his com-

mittee. The ﬁnal result is a J_u--

dicial Board composed of ﬁve
student justices.

The Board would have juris-
diction over most of the com-
mon dormitory violations. Such
violations include: possession of
alcoholic beverages, possession of
ﬁrecrackers or explosives, des-
truction of dormitory property,
ﬁghting, gambling, possession of
Weapons, and violation of proba-
tion.

The penalties decided ‘by the
judges can ‘range from a mere
reprimand to expulsion from the
University. In general, all seri-
ous penalties “would be in the
form of recommendations to the
Dean of Men or Director of Men's
Housing.” All other Judicial
Board decisions would be ﬁnal.

Meisner contends that the By-
Laws also contain many provi-

sions safeguarding the rights of '

the student. For example, very
strict rules of procedure have
been established to ensure that
the defender is properly inform-
ed of his trial, and that there
is correct procedure at the hear-
ings. There is a provision against
double jeopardy andunnecessary
spectators will not be allowed at
the hearing. Finally, there is a
procedure for appeal.
According to Meisner, the ad-
ministration is behind the basic
concept of the Judicial Board and

all indications -are that Dean Mc-, "V

‘Pitt News’ Interview

Senator Clark DiscussesWorld Conflict

by PAUL STOLLER

1,.

Today, the world is plagued by
many international conflicts. The
war in Vietnam, the menace of
Red China, the problem of Ger-

‘,man reuniﬁcation, and the dan-
gers of nuclear proliferation are
constantly commented on. In a
special interview, Senator Joseph
S. Clark, the senior senator from
Pennsylvania and member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit.
tee, revealed his opinions on
these crucial topics.

‘In discussing the United States
policy in Vietnam, Senator Clark
stated, “Our policy in Vietnam is

overextended. It is clear that we
will not drive out Viet Cong.” In
Senator Clark’s opinion, it will
be impossible to win the war.
“But we cannot afford to lose it.”
He believed that the only feasi-
ble way to get out of Vietnam is
to incorporate the Gavin theory.
“In other words,” Senator Clark
emphasized, “the United States
must halt its bombings in the
North, but maintain its manpow-
er in the South.” In short, the
Gavin theory stresses the fact
that if the war is not escalated,
the North Vietnamese will ne-
gotiate. “The only way to get
out of Vietnam,” according to
Senator Clark, “is by negotiated
settlement because a complete
military withdrawal would be
disasterous.”

When asked whether Red Chi-
na should be regarded as our
formidible rival—if not our fore-
most rival, Senator Clark an-
swered negatively. "‘The fear o-f
Red China is a tremendous mis-
conception today,” he replied.
He was not really concerned with
Red China’s increasing nuclear
capability.

“One shouldn’t really be con-

cerned with the Red Chinese be-
-cause the United States and the
Soviet Union could wipe out the
nuclear capacity of Red China at
a moments notice.” “Besides,”
Senator Clark added, “the inter-
nal situation in Red China today
is no less than an all out civil
war, which weakens the Chinese
position considerably.”

In response "to the question
whether or not the United States
should support German reuniﬁ-
cation, Senator Clark again re-
sponded in the negative. “A uni-

tcrnational situation in such a
way as to alter many existing
foreign policies.” Too many na-
tions fear the presence of ‘a uni-
ﬁed Germany.

Shifting his attentions to an-
other geographic area of conﬂict,
the Senator discussed the situa-
tion in the Middle East. .“The
Middle East is literally a powder
keg ready to explode at any
time.” According to Senator
Clark, one of the causes of the
touchy Middle East situation “is
that the United States supplies
military aid to the opposing Is-
raeli and Arab factions.”

“When the Israelis- attacked
Jordan, the United States sped up
its shipment of ﬁghter bombers
to Jordan. Consequently, the
United States military aid policy
concerning the Middle East has
inadvertently caused a regional
arms race. I believe that instead
of continuing to send military
aid to the Middle East, we should
concentrate on economic aid.”

uation of nuclear proliferation,

How Do You Think Student Expression On Crucial 
Best Be Articulated To The Administration?

Issues Can

by KEN FREDERICK

ARA Presidential Candidate

The ﬁrst plank in the ABA
platform states that our ﬁrst goal
will be a representative and effec-
tive implementation of the Stu-
dent Government (SG) Constitu-
tion. The Constitution itself, how-
ever, is only a piece of paper un-
less the people who compose SG
next year are truly representa-
tive of our student body. An ef-
fective implementation of this
Constitution is one way that we
can express student opinion to
the administration.

However, I do not believe that
the SG Constitution represents
the only way to express student
opinion. The Trimester P011, to
which almost 3,000 students re-
sponded this past year proved to
be another way to present the
student will to the Chancellor.
Our regular advisory meetings
with the Chancellor which my
running mate, Tom Meisner, and
I attended as president of Men’s
Dorm Council and the president
of Interfraternity Council also
produced results this year: the

commitment for a new Student
Union, the clean up of the pre-
sent Union, and the probable re-
moval of the out-of-state fee.
These are the results which count.
Obviously there is more than
one means of communicating
with the administration.

.There is, however, only one
manner of presenting ideas and
proposals to the administration:
the way we obtained the prom-
ise of a new Student Union. Our
successful approach this year is
in sharp contrast to the meth-
ods used by SG two years ago.
This year we did not try to intim-
idate the administration. We sat
down with the Chancellor and
rationally explained our position.
We needed no threats ‘of “volatile
situations.” We needed only to
speak in a responsible manner
with dignity and respect. We
have every right to disagree with
the administration, but we must
not lose our respect for it.

We must, therefore, use the
means available to us in the SG
Constitution along with polls
such as the Trimester ‘Poll, and

the Student Affairs Advisory
Committee to express the stu-
dent will to the administration.
But most important is our ap-
proach: it must be with dignity
and respect.

IHIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllllllllllllll

by JOHN RUSKAY

PPP Presidential Candidate

The students are citizens of the
University as much as they are
citizens of their country. Their
rights and their privileges within

‘the University must be protected

as much as their civil rights as
Americans. ,

The Student Government (SG)
president, as one of the only two
students directly elected by all
students, must see to it that the
students’ views are represented
at all ‘levels of decision-making
that effect them directly. That
is to say that student views must
be heard before a decision is
made regarding prices of meal
tickets in the Towers or the
building of new dorms or the ex-
pansion of the student-faculty

ra.tio in the classroom.

Before he can represent them,
it is important that the SG pres-
ident must ﬁrst be able to in-
form‘ the student body about both
sides of all relevant issues and
then have some effective means
01 guaging their opinions. The
PPP has advocated a monthly
newsletter that will serve as an
effective means of communica-
tion, establishing direct contact
between the president and the
student body. \

It is only after this informative
process that students can _voice

-an educated opinion. SG should

then sponsor forums, discussions,
debates, etc., to ﬁnd out what
student opinion is on major is-
sues. At present, these are being
held only during the election
campaign. A responsible presi-
dent must see to it that they are
continued even after his election.

As the Outstanding Senator of
1965, I have gained invaluable
experience in dealing with the
administration. I have realized
that the administration, by the
very fact that it is an adminis-

trative bureacracy, cannot always
be expected tosthoroughly under-
stand student problems. It is the
job of the SG president to articu-
late the conditions and the needs
of the student body. It is the
president who should establish

an effective communication be- ~
tween the administration and the‘

students. The relaying of student
opinion to the administration
will be effective only if the ad-
ministration realizes that /this
opinion is an informed and a
concerned one. A responsible
and a reasonable president can
achieve this. 4
It has been my contention that
students, faculty and administra-
tors must work together in areas
of mutual concern. This need
has been realized in thenew
Constitution which I co-author-
ed. A part of this Constitution is
the University Review Board, a

practical manifestation of that

concept that the three arms of
the University can, and must
work together in areas of mu-

tual concern. This is responsible ‘S t ‘

change.

Dean Zoffer Comments

Student Interest in Business Careers Still High

(Continued from Page 1)
number of advertisements for
corporation opportunities appear-
ing in the Pitt News and in other
student publications also reﬁect
a trend in graduate school en-
rollment. ’

Dean Zoffer replied, “Business
schools teach administrative skills
which can be used in hospitals
and retail marketing as. well as
in corporation work. Our number
of Business Board takers is
steadily rising.” He added that
the engineers -and others plan-
ning to do corporation work are
often enrolled in business school
because they have a tremendous
appreciation of the need for com-

bination of technical and admin-
istrative skills.

The controversy arises, said
Dean Zoifer, because of better
education in the general area of
values and understanding of the
world; It supegﬁrgiajlly appears,
he said, that these values are con-
tradicted in business. People are
more vocal now and some of
them suggest that there is some-
thing immoral about business.

“But,” said Dean Zoffer, “it’s
very difficult to criticize some-
thing which you have never been
a part of, and I’m not sure that
people go into business primarily
to make money.” He added that
business career offers are in com-

petition with jobs in the Peace
Corps and Vista, jobs which ﬁre
the imagination.

Business is mundane sometimes,
he admitted, but the salaries are
still good and there is a chance
for achievement. It is still pos-
sible to rise through the heir-
archy to become president of the
company.

Dean Zoifer concluded that
there‘ is much opportunity for

students who wish to study busi-
ness in the‘ graduate school, not

only for engineers and economics ,

majors, b-ut also for those with
a liberal arts background. “But

business may have failed,” he
said, “to communicate the true
environment to be found in busi-
ness.” ’

to him, and it is his decision to whether the rules will be approved or
disapproved, sometime next week.

We feel there is only one decision for the administration to make.

' The rules must be approved and put into Operation for ‘W0 I‘e3-S0I1S- First,

the dorm regulations are rational ones which improve resident facilities,
and second, they are a reﬂection of the Opinion Of the men in the d0I'mS,
as articulated by the duly elected senators of MDC. _

According to the MDC proposals the present “open house” System

t____will be extended to allow women in the rooms from 9 p.m..-to 1 am.‘ on
’ Friday’ and Saturday nights on a permanent basis. In this way prime

study hours will not be interrupted by the possible commotion of having
women on the ﬂoor. These are the hours that men will logically devote
to their social life and thus this period represents the time men would

Some -argued that such visitations would mean that dormitory rooms
would be misused. To those who offer such arguments we reply that the
dignity of the dormitories will not suffer since doors are required to be
half way open. We look forward to the day when the respect for the
quality of the student body will be such that “open door” rejoiners will
no longer be necessary.’

It would seem incredible to us that the administration could refuse
the men of the dorms the right of extended facilities considering the lim-
ited lounge areas in the University. Those who complain that there is no
place to go with your date on weekends at the University are justiﬁed.

. You only have to look at the Student Union lobby on Saturday night to

realize this. If the new regulations are approved, then men would have
the additional areas of the rooms and the upper ﬂoor lounges to which
they can take their dates. W, ~ ‘

In the past, some ad-hoc groups who in effect represented no one
sought changes in the dormitory regulations. This is not the case with
the proposed social rules. They have been discussed and passed by the rep-
resentative leaders of the dorm houses. The tact and effectiveness with
which MDC has researched this problem for over a year is an excellent
example of student diligence. We can only hope the administration will

Ex-SG Officers
Tell of Ruskay

Editor, The Pitt News: -
We, the undersigned member

of the 1965-66 Student Govern-
Z ment, remember John Ruskay and

the Pitt Progressive Party (PPP).
We sat through six-hour ‘meet-
ings while the PPP Senators rant-
ed and raved about the “volatile
situation” which would occur on
this campus if we a_cted accord- '
ing to our convictions. We re-
member that Eric Stern, the pres-

_ ident endorsed by the PPP, re-
-- signed; we remember the PPP

-Senators who walked out with
:3 him. We watched the PPP Sen-
 ators walk out of an SG meeting
‘ii ‘when they could not convince us

that their methods were correct.
Some of us have all ready been

i graduated from Pitt, some us are
‘ still undergraduates, but all of
”  can never forget what the SG
' became on this campus: a farce ~
_‘ and a. joke. John Ruskay and the
‘ PPP disgraced Student Govern-
‘— «ment (SG); it was laughed at by

the students and by the adminis-

' tration. Our University was ridi-
‘ culed. 

We speak to you now as peo-

ple who have lived through a
‘ year in SG with the PPP. We
_ , urge you to think seriously about”
 what the PPP did the last time

it was elected. We remember

 how John Ruskay, Eric Stern, and
-{W the PPP abused the power that

the students had given to them.

ing that year, we hope you will
ask the people who were; they,
too, have not forgotten.

Territoriality
Talk Praised

Editor, The Pitt News;

Snoopy and the Red Baron,

might even get to be friends
some day. I’m. ready to believe
anything now. _A funny thing,
you see, happened to melon the
way to graduation. It's tough be-
ing number two, and I guess in
all my wildest ﬁghts of fancy, I
just never imagined that the fac-
ulty and the administration could
really care ab out important
things—like what’s happening on
this. planet, or on this campus‘, or
in the minds and hearts of Pitt
students. Well, I know different-
ly now, and I guess I don’t even
care anymore if the cafeteria
puts ﬂies in  mashed potatoes,
or the elevators don’t like me, or
the computer still calls me by
the wrong number.

My conversion took place at 9
o’clock Saturday morning in Din-
ing Room A of the Student Union,
where a hardy group of about
60-—students, faculty, and admin-
istration--had gathered of their

own free will for a worksh_op,'_

called “The Sublimation of Terri-
toriality: Sex, Politics, and Reli-
gion.-” The hour may‘ have been
unforgivable and the topic in-
credible, but the most amazing
thing was how much we all en-
joyed it. The topicﬁproved to be
pretty stimulating after all, and
the workshop was probably one
of the most exciting things that
ever happened on this campus.
Where else could an English ‘ma-
jor talk with a professor-of an-
thropology or a clean of the

School of Engineering about-

things like Vietnam, the Death
of God, urbanization, identity,
and the masters’ study? P
I'm glad I was a part of it all,
“and I'd like to thank everyone
who helped make it such a great
success — especially Dr.. Warren
Hill of the University Counsel-
ing Center, who was chieﬂy re-_
sponsible for bringing all of us
together. There will be another
student-faculty workshop in the
near future and I can only’ en-

courage anyone who missed this.

In Our, Cities

The Problems of Poverty  

THE PROBLEMS of a
city are great and diverse.-
Many people have tried'to
deﬁne these problems and
act upon them; They point
to ghettos of poverty with

the charactertistic features,

of ﬁlth and apathy and lack
of direction among its inhab-
itants. In order to correct
these “evils” city govern-
ments ‘build public housing
facilities in order to clean
up the ghettos. This as most
other programs with simi-
liar content‘-‘;treat merely the
symptom rather than the
cause of, the disease. They
carelessly obliterate that
which exist (the ghetto) for
another ghetto elsewhere.
We must realize that the
cause of at least 80 per cent

of the poverty ghettos in,

this country is based upon
the’ apathy of the middle-
class, affluent, college grad-
uate class.

We have built a society so
fast and with so much tech-
nology that our inventions
have at times outstripped
our ability to control them.
The result has been a deper-’
sonalized “inhuman” society.
We have built a‘ society
grounded on machines
rather than--a society based
on human individuality. As

part of that society, we have -

built and are participating
in a social system that is so
based upon the reward sys-
tem, personal “advance-
ment,” and anomie that we

neglect those who the sys-.

tem has left behind.

The dwellers of our na-
tion’s slums are in their en-
vironment not because they
are lazy, or stupid or racial-

ly inferior, BUT BECAUSE ‘

WE PUT THEM THERE.
The great Iniddle-class col-
lege graduate society has so
ignored the creatures of pov-
erty, creatures which the
middle-class has created,
that the conditions of fer-
ment, dispair and frustration
are inevitable. Unemploy-
ment in the Great Depres-
sion of the 30’s was around
12 per cent, while today in
Watts unemployment ranges
from 20-40 per cent, and we

bear, the responsibility for

‘that condition. 
"NOR -IS Watts the only

OS 11

The

liens‘ from? this P

if by Stephen D. Leightman K

Iar depreviation and squaloe
exist even in the golden met-

ropolis of Pittsburgh. It is,

the middle -class structure
that has either neglected or

A exploited underthe guise of

proﬁt, and self-advancement
the lower socio-economic

- groups of our society.

That we as rational peo-
ple ‘ bear the "responsibility

for all our actions, may come

as no surprise, but it is-

equally important to realize
that we bear responsibility
for ' those ﬂconditions created
because of our failure to act.

. It is this lack of action that

is to be the demise of our
democratic system, and we
are. the ones to blame. This
writer has heard many peo-
ple express alarm at condi-
tions in our nation‘s cities
and of _ our society as a
whole, but this writer has
seen but a minimum of AC-
TION directed at the solu-
tion of. those tormenting
problems. ’

Sitting in the Towers
Snack Bar or in the Tuck

Shop will not solve anything’

except to perhaps to relieve
the guilt conscience of the
Pitt student. We can talk all
we want about our problems,
but talk is meaningless un-

less it is coupled with mean-_

ingful action. . '

MANY EXCUSES have

been advanced for the lack
of action on this and other
college campuses. Some. say
that they cannot ﬁnd the
time to serve their fellow
man because the university
is so demanding. But when
will we ﬁnd the time? How
many days shall we let this
problem fester and grow,
without committing our-
selves to act upon these slum

conditions. We as students,

have more free time than
we will havevat any other

l

times in -our lives, our prob-
lem is that we are Very pro-
ﬁcient is wasting that spare
time.

Every student at this Uni-
versity has the ability to
commit himself to. a policy
of concerted action rather
than decadent apathgy. Other
students have said that they
must know all the answers
to a problem before they
can attempt to help the sit-
uation; This attitude is just
a camouﬂage for their own
lack of concern. We can sit
all day and talk about the
effect of a white man’s pres-
ence in the Hill District, but
until we have made an ef-
fort to communicate with
our less fortunate, we will
have accomplished nothing.

LET US shed our shield
of apathy and react like re-
sponsible people to the prob-

- lems that we have created,

and let us act NOW not to-
morrow..If this society will
-become. a stable and healthy
one, then it can_- only be
through the efforts of this
» generation. We, as potential
leaders of that future socie-

A ty, have not met. our great-

 
    

est of all challenges—-—com-
mitment. ..

Ample organizations exist
on this campus for the chan-
neling of student energy and
commitment. It is our obli-

' gation as a united student

body to endorse, support and
affirm their efforts, and join
forces With -HEP, NAACP,
the Pitt YMCA Y-‘Corps, and
‘ other action oriented student
efforts. If we do not meet
this challenge of our times,
then we deserve whatever
fate the future has in store
for us, for it is we who here

and now can shape the fu-

ture. --

Student Defends
Party Platform

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a transfer student, and not.

one well acquainted with poli-
tics at this University, I feel I
must comment, if only from sheer
perplexity and disbelief, on the
editorial criticizing the platform
of the PPP. I“rea1ize that it is
the privilege of any newspaper
to support one candidate in favor

of another, but the criticism of’

the PPP platform and the praise
of the ARA platform seems to
be based purely on value judg-
ment, faculty logic, and, most im-
portantly, complete lack of the
idealism which you condemn, and
which I praise as vital to student
life. Should the PPP accept the
ridiculous nickel and two-hour
parking meters merely because
they exist? Rather, is it not more
important that they verbalize an
obvious problem and attempt to
ameliorate it? This is surely as
important to a commuting stu-
dent as more lockersin the base-
ment, and seemingly as feasible!
This is, of course, a minor ex-
ample, but, because it is the one
the Pitt News chose, I follow in
its pattern.

In all, in the trimester which
I have been at Pitt, I have found
interest in the Student Govern-
ment to be very meager. I, for
one, am pleased to know that
some liberal idealist do exist

stiﬂed by the inherent super-

tion, through the PPP some of
that very necessary “pie-in-the-

that an editorial that did not

Faculty to Decide Status

B.U. ROTC May Lose Academic Credit

by RAYMOND MUNGO

BOSTON, Mass., (CPS)-
Boston University’s volun-
tary Reserve Officer Train-
ing Corps (ROTC) program
is expected to lose academic
credit and curricular stand-
ing next month (Feb. 15) in a
formal faculty vote on the issue.

Following a bitter campus-wide
debate over the merits of the
ROTC program, the faculty indi-
cated in an unofficial poll (Jan.
5) that it favored abolition of
academic standing for student
_military training.

The debate over ROTC was
sparked by the Boston University
News, the student weekly, last
September when it published a
three-page attack on the Univer-
sity’s Army-Air Force cadet pro-
gram in its opening issue of the
year. The News called for an end
to ROTC’s “privileged” academic

A status on campus and urged that

the ROTC program be made an
extra-curricular activity.

The paper charged that the

campus military “simultaneous-
ly offers official credit, awards
‘professorships’ (outside the jur-
isdiction of our own faculty),
speaks on official platforms, re-
ceives‘ free rent, occupies preci-
ous classroom space, and in gen-
eral manipulates a totalitarian
discipline behind the mask of ed-
ucational sanctuary and under
the name of the university we all
constitute.”

The editorial was accompanied
by a faculty petition calling ROTC
“inappropriate in purpose, sub-

stance or control to a university
curriculum.”

The editorial brought sharp re-
action from groups inside and
outside the University. President

-Harold C. Case issued a state-

ment “to rule ROTC off-campus

. would be as much a denial _.

of the traditional rights and
privileges of students as to make
it mandatory.”

Philosophy Professor Erazin
Kohak supported the ROTC pro-
gram because he said it encour-
aged a civilian army through col-
lege t.raining——in sharp contrast
to the professional armies he en-
countered while growing up in

that being a Monkee is not

Another Day

Jim Flanigan Heads
Into A World of Pros

By Tom Sacks

"" ‘35555555'=llIl|IllIllI|lI'
i

‘ 'I|IllI

Sports Editor

Jim Flanigan was relaxing in his room in the dormi-
tories several nights ago. Surrounding him were several
of the souvenirs gathered during his football career at Pitt.
Rooms in the Towers aren’t exactly enormous in the ﬁrst
place and with the souvenirs, weights and Jim’s 240 pounds
the room wasn’t getting any bigger. -

In a way the cramped -room represented the closing
. act of a successful production. Stitched on
a blanket hanging on the Wall were the
words: “Jim Flanigan, Captain, University
of Pittsburgh.” The blanket itself is sym-
bolic of the closing curtain.

One phase of J im’s life has ended. With-
in another month, another stage will have
begun. For by- that time the name “F1ani-
gan’? will have been added to .a professional
roster and it will probably stay there a
long time.‘ ~ -

 

The ‘future ahead for Flanigan is bright and -it also con-
tains a great deal of pressure. Despite it all, he has still re-
tained his sense of humor. c

When someone said, “I guess I’ll be seeing you on TV‘
_on Sundays several years from now,” Flanigan replied,

“Most likely replacing the divots.

Most likely it will be somebody else replacing the divots
that Flanigan has created. -

For Jim there is no question in_ his mind about the pros.
He wants it and the pros want him. Nearly every team, AFL
and NFL, has contacted him. As Jim put it, football is part
of his life and it’s pretty tough to turn olf part of your life

“I’m pretty sure now that I’ll take a pro offer,” said
Flanigan. “I’ve been playing football too long to just stop.
I’ll probably play until something happens which makes 1t
impossible for me to go on.”

Jim had his ﬁrst taste of what the proslwill be like

i » several weeks ago in the Senior Bowl. He liked what he saw.

Norm Van Brockin of the Minnesota Vikings was head
coach of the North and Jim was calling the defense signals.
The South only gained 23 yards rushing.

“Down there, they treated you like a pro. If you want-
ed to smoke, you could smoke; if you Wanted to drink, you

could drink; They didn’t care what you did as long as you

produced ‘on the ﬁeld.”

“Everybody down there was a. great athlete. They
knew what they had to do and they did it. I didn’t have to
  .      run all over the ﬁeld making
I ‘ tackles. All I had to do was

take care of my own area.
 We would go in for three

'~ plays and then go back, sit
on the bench, talk, and enjoy
the football game.”

For Flanigan it must have
been extra enjoyable. Dur-
ing the regular season. he
had been playing 40 minutes
a game, trying to jam up
holes all over the ﬁeld. In
the bowl game, he played
only 25 minutes and only
had to worry about himself.

Jim was a little apprehen-
sive When he ﬁrst reported
to Mobile forpractice. Ap-

ability and apprehensive
about the Panther record. .

- “Everybody asked what

 type of season we had had. I

I told them we were in the process of rebuilding.” »

In a way he was apologizing. But he also would [say
that he was still glad he came to Pitt over the other 95 of-
fers he had coming out of West Miiflin North.

“I can say that I played against the best even though
we weren’t the best. I’ve also gotten good _publ1c1ty and
good coaching. The main problem here was lack of fore-
sight on the part of Michelosen and the Athletic Depart-

prehensive about his. own ’

Cagers Tonight

by MIKE BROURMAN A \

F rash

While many have already tapped this year’s freshman
cagers as the best Cub team in 15 years, others have re-
served their judgment. But after tonight, they,may be

Willing to take a stand.

For tonight, the Cubs take on
the West Virginia fresh in what
may be their most difficult as-
signment of the year, in a game

A ‘beginning at"6:15 p.m.

Led by Marv-. Snowden, who
grew up within blocks of the
_Field House, the Litt1e-Mountain-
cers have totaled ﬁve victories
while losing only to Kentucky.

The 6’3” Snowden has hit on
60 per cent of his shots, aver-
aged 20 points and grabbed off
nine rebounds per contest. An-
other Pittsburgher, Wayne Por-
ter is averaging 16 points while
hitting 53 per cent of his shots
and is the team’s playmaker.

The third hot. shooting Little
Mountaineer is Bob Hummel; a

6’3” backcourt man who was the -

top high school player in West
Virginia last year and has aver-

. aged 23 points for the freshmen.

To counter . this team, which

has hit an aggregate of 49 per
cent from the ﬁeld, Cub coach
Tim Grgurich plans to employ
his basic, pressing man to man
defense.

“When you’ve won six straight,”
said Grgurich,_,“you ‘don’t make
big changes. We’re going to go

_with what we do best, and that’s

a pressing man to man. And on
offense, we’ll take our time and
set up the good shot. We’re in no
hurry to score.”

In>Grgurich’s man to man, 6’4”
forward Mike Patcher will have
the, job of containing Snowden.
He had the same assignment last

year when Bishop McCort met

Schenley, and McCort won. Grgu-
rich is hoping for the same re-
sult this year. “Their coach
thinks that they’re going to win,
but I know that We’re going to
win. Either way it should be a
great game.”

First Test For Banner

TrackSTeam to h Meet Kent State;i,i
Lack of Depth Still Plagues Coach

. by DAN LICHTENSTEIN
. When Jim Banner stepped
in as the new head track
coach, he inherited a problem

that has plagued the track"

team for years: lack of depth.
Whether this old, problem is too
much for the new coach and his
athletes will be determined this
Saturday when the team hosts

Kent State in Fitzgerald Field’
.House.

Banner has some ﬁne athletes
on his squad and they are -all in
top shape, but there just aren’t
enough of them. The team will
be losing "byinine points before
the meet even starts because Ban-
ner will have to forfeit the pole
vault event. He has none.

It will then beup to boys like

 i_I-Iandelnhian, -Roger I_-Iolly_
’ Cd I 3?tW°i§i  "?.‘.’...".1.?%k‘*-"7

   

= 5D§Vi5

Wojciechoski is probably Ban-
ner’s best sprinter and should
score a "lot of, points this year.
But he’ll have to beat Kent’s
Oran Richberg, a 9.5 100-yard
man, for a ﬁve point ﬁrst place
on Saturday. He will have Doug
Doben and Carl Wooten to help.

_Holly, a junior, is in such’ good

"shape that Baumer will use him

in the two-mile relay team. Holly
was a hurdler last year, but Ban-
ner now needs 'his stamina for
the longer race. Handelman, Ken
Lawton and Larry Hubner com-
plete that relay team which should
be’ the team’s strongest asset.
Handelman will also run either
the mile or the 1,000-yard run, If

he competes in the mile, he’ll -

face Kent’s Sam _Bair Who set a
field’ house" record here last a year-
of 4:143.  i

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor

Just before leaving Uni-
versity Park after the disas-
trous defeat last Saturday

 

Panther basketball coach Bob -~
Timmons mumbled something =
about “I guess the sun will shine;
tomorrow.” Whereupon someone

‘quipped, “never at Penn State.”

In a basketball sense, tonight’s 
8:15 meeting with West Virginia?‘
won’t provide any chance for sun: 
worshipping at the Field House—,:

either.

The Mountaineers are faster
and bigger than Penn State, plus 
they possess one of the country's 2
ﬁnest backcourt operations in :_

Ron 

Timmons analyzed the game this 
way. “We’re going to have to;_

contend with size in Bob Ben-

ﬁeld (6-8), their leading reboun- *
West Virginia runs more 
than Penn State did, and their  ‘.1
1-3-1 zone will pressure us more.”
on offense. Williams, of course, _
is quicker than (Jeff) Persson 

der.

was.”

Although Williams and forward .
Dave Reaser both average better 
than 21 points a game, and Carl‘ 

Head adds more than 18, West
'_Virginia can only boast a 7-4 rec-
ord.

The reason is their bench. The I
Mountaineers have lost spark: '
plugs Dave Palmer and Jim Lew-
is through injuries. Last year I
coach Bucky Walters could count”:
on his reserves to give his fast- ;f
breaking team a breather. Now.
Waters can only comment, “The }
longer the game lasts, the more

trouble we’re in.” -

Timmons also knows the 
lem of a thin bench. He saw Penn
State’s reserves outscore his own .

26-0. “For some reason, I ha.v‘e_n’tl

been able to get anything from ,

Ken Bollens or from Tony De-A‘
Lisio,” he noted. _
The Panther coach mentioned

other . faults the cagers will at-

tempt to correct tonight.“ “We'll,

have to handle the ball better, i
box out underneath the back-_:_
‘boards better, and shoot better”;

than 29 per cent,”,he concluded

That’s quite an assignment;-“f

is only a sophomore 
enced‘. In other running events
Paul Lambert, Tom Christie 

Dave Brinn are all top hurdlers  
and Banner has two strong boys 
in Paul Greig and Fran Shor for .-

the two-mile nlh. ' " _ _

A few runners, like Handel
man, Hubner and Lavzton, can
double up and run two events

But where the lack of depth will-_‘-:
most seriously hurt is in the ﬁeld

events. Jim Flannigan holds-]th_,

varsity shot put record, but now-j‘
after the Senior Bowl football ‘

-game, he is a professional atli

lete and thus inelligible.“ Greg

. Ellis will have to ﬁll Flannigan’; '
shoes in that event for Banne‘
to hope for a win. , Vi.

Beano Analy

by GEORGE LIES
Assistant Sports Editor

Beano Cook, the ex-sports

.information director at the

University, was in town last
week and brought to the fore-
front a critical analysis of what
is wrong with the sports pro-
gram here. In an interview, he
oifered his suggestions and his
answers to many problems.

Asked the question, “What is
wrong . . .? he answered in a
very serious tone. “Pitt has cer-
tain problems,” he said. “It’s
hurting because it has to be so
idealistic.”

Beano started at the top. “Take
football for instance. To play
two—platoon football, you have to
give 40 scholarships a year (pres-
sently, 100 are given over a four-
year period)‘ and you have to
redshirt,” he said. “A lot of coach-
es think Pitt is nuts for not red-

I. shirting.

.they could never win,”

“Under the present conditions,
said
Beano.

“Dave Hart is a good recruiter

—_ because he has motivation, but

whether or not he is good on the
day of a game has to be proven,”
said Beano. “It’s too bad Johnny
Michelosen who had a ﬁne know-
ledge of the game, didn’t have

- Hart's motivation.”

He continued, and analyzed the
basketball situation. “In basket-
ball, there is no need to red-
shirt. Because even when Pitt

“It’s Pitt’s attitude toward bas-
ketball,” said Beano. “Pitt could
be winning and not be sure if
they care. There are only two
ways to go, that’s ﬁrst class or
third class. And Pitt goes second
class.

“No one really dies with bas-

“I’m not as critical of him as I
was a few years ago,” said Beano.
“Before it was impossible for
him to coach and recruit at the
same time, but now he has Tim
Grgurich to recruit for him and
now. I can see he is a good
coach.”

Beano worked over the two
big sports pretty well, but why
did the school’s sports program
decline within the last few years?

“Frank Carver (the Athletic
Director) has been the victim of
certain administrators for the de-
cline of intercollegiate sports at
Pitt,” answered Beano. “Even a
new chancellor isn’t the answer
because it's the Board of Trus-
tees which govern university
policy. ;

“And this administration must
decide what it wants to do,” he
said.

Swimmers Host W. Virginia;
am First Win

Expect

toG

by JAY 

With the basketball and wrestling teams seemingly

doomed to losing seasons, the swimming team maybe the .

only Varsity winter’ sport to have a winning record this year.

The swimmers have been go-
ing through long practice ses-
sions and it looks like things will
begin to pay oﬁ when they meet
West Virginia this afternoon at
6 p.m. in Trees Pool. The team
hopes to gain their ﬁrst Victory
of the season by defeating the
Mountaineers. »

The team is led by freestyler

- John Lane who captured three

ﬁrsts last Saturday in the 100,
200, and 500-yard freestyle events
to enable the swimmers to tie
Syracuse, 52-52. In the ﬁrst of
those three events Lane set a
school record of 49 seconds ﬂat.

Gary Martin, who swims in the
50 and 100-yard sprints, should
do well in tonight’s meet, and
along with Lane, forms a nucleus
that will be hard to beat in the
freestyle events. -Senior Michael
Olesak .also adds strength to the

. short sprints.

In the 200-yard backstroke, Joe
LeViere and Russ Lindberg are
ready to repeat tonight the per-
formance that they had against
the Orangeman. They ﬁnished a
strong one-two in this event last
Saturday to give their team a
much needed seven points.

In diver Dean Coleman, coach
Jerry Snyder seems to have found
the right person to replace Don
Hahnfeldt. Hahnfeldt, who grad-
uated last June, placed second in
both the one and three meter
diving events in the Easterns. At
this stage, Coleman is no Hahn-

feldt but he is the type of consis-

tent performer who could place
first or second in almost every
meet.

Th other diver, Rodney Cham-
bers, is also a bright spot in
Snyder’s plans. Diving is some-
thing new to -Chambers, but he
has learned two years worth of
skill in a three month period and
should start coming into his own.

Co-captain Dick Huhne and

sophomore Howie Norris have al-
ready given indication that they
will be a tough pair in the but-
terﬂy events. Team strength is
also added by Norris’ twin broth-
er, Richie, as he is surpassed
Only by John Lane in the dis-
tance freestyles. ,

What the swimming team has
this year is a squad of overall
depth. John Lane is the strong-
man, while Coleman, Martin, Le.
Viere, and the Norris twins are
all solid perfor1ners_

Dear Mr. Galvin:

F The TIME Essay in the November 4 issue deals

 with the increasingly acute problem of over-
crowding in our society. The essay concludes
by citing the danger posed to the ”. . . most
cherished prerogative of the peripatetic
American: the ability to go places at ‘will, and
to get-there fast.” Though the article addresses
itself specifically to transportation, this
comment applies to my generation in general.
We want to get places, and get there fast.

A Now let's examine the highways available to Us. _

Let meoversimplify reality for the purpose of
discussion and assume that there are three
possible roads, at the end of which are three
basically similar career goals. I shall assume
that the goal of a doctor is to practice
medicine, the goal of a lawyer is to practice
law, and the goal of a businessman is to
administer a business.

You pointed out that doctors and lawyers
have apprenticeships just as do businessmen._
~Do they? From the moment a young doctor or
lawyer enters his profession, he has reached
his initial career goal. He may be assigneda
relatively unimportant case to begin with, but
the case is a distinct unit unto itself which he
eanrobserve from inception to completion. The
same body of law and the same medical
phenomena apply equally to all cases, large or

B If business offers individuality,

small, and the enteringpractitioner. is able to
see the results of his contribution.-

Can the young MBA graduate immediately
begin to administer a business? All the doctor
or lawyer must study is medicine and law,
while the businessman must study more than
just business: he must study Motorola business
or the specific methodsof wnichever company
he works for. The yoqng businessman, then,

is put into a department of some sort where,
even if he does have administrative authority
within his section, he is unable to see the total
picture of the industry; he is unab_le to
measure his contribution. While the doctor
and lawyer reach their career goals immedi-
ately, the businessman must wait years.

jWe want to get places and get therefast.

Business seems a long road indeed. ’‘

And not only is the road long, but a serious
detour exists. Every healthy male member of

' my generation is faced witha common

problem: the draft. Regardless of personal
political views, we have'~to consider the
ramifications of military service and deferment
when considering potential careers. Frankly,
business has little to offer in this light. While
going to school, there is a betterchance for
deferment for medicine and teaching than for
business; law and medicine offer opportunities
for direct commissions after graduation; the
Peace Corps, Foreign Service, and VISTA pro-
vide attractive alternatives to a combat unit.

And what about the years involved? In most
professions, military service means that a few
years must be put aside before starting a
career; but in business, these years are
compounded with interest. Business, by the
definition of a free economy, is a highly
competitive affair; those lost years, therefore,
represent lost opportunities for climbing the
corporate ladder. Even further questions arise
from the prevailing notion that many
companies refuse to hire a man until he has
completed his military commitment.

Has business done anything to meet this
problem? You may not be able to convince
the military to grant draft deferments or
commissions to business graduates, but you
had better do something to convince potential‘
entrees into business careers that they aren't

under as serious initial handicap. A detour this
major, on an already laboriousroad, may be
enough to discourage travel at all.

We're still on’ my hypothetical road, app.roach-
ing your hypothetical bridge. ”There’s a wide
gulf separating your ideas and mine,” you
wrote. ”Let’s try and bridge it." Is there really
a gulf between us? Yourideas are the result of
what must have been an extremely successful
career. My ideas are the result of my percep-
tion of business; I am simply a consumer of
business’ public image. The gulf, therefore, is
notlbetween you and me, but between your
ideas and experience and what your industry
projects. It would seem that you and your
colleagues have been so intent on industry

development and mod.ernization that you have I

neglected to modernize your public image at
the same time.

It seems odd that the AMA and the American
Bar Association haven't begun recruitment
campaigns on college campuses as has
business. You said, ’’I see business as offering
those very things—individuality, recognition
and personal satisfaction—that you imply it

lacks.” if business has all this to offer, why

aren't people aware of. it?

You paint a beautiful picture. You paint it-
your industry does not. While I marvel at your
artistry, I wonder atthe inconsistency between
belief and representation. l—want to get places,
and get there fast. Can I do it in business?
