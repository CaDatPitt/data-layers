Vandalism on Pitt campus

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

-The recent installation of signs in
the Cathedral of Learning class-

rooms stating that “Defacing of,

property can cost you up to $300”
prompts the question: Is there a
problem with vandalism at Pitt?
The reaction. of Pitt officials was
decidedly mixed.’James Beavers, the
associate‘ director of Housing and
Food Service, replied with an
emphatic_“Yes.” He conceded that

the student dormitories have had
more of a problem with vandalism
than most of the campus but cre-
dited students for the general decline
he has noted in the past few years.
_According to Beavers, students real-
ize that vandalism _will affect them
monetarily and have been effective

in helping the university reclaim_

damages from vandals.

But Chris Chergi, building man-
ager for the William Pitt Union,
said, “I don’t know of any vandalism
...” She notes that‘ although there
were minor incidents before the
recent renovation, there has been a

100 percent turnaround since reop-
ening. “Students seem to care (and)
want to, preserve what we have
here.”

In the 1980-81 school year, $3,800
was recovered through the judicial
review process. In the
school year the figure jumped to
$12,700, "and in the following year,
they collected $21,000 from dormi-
tory vandals. Beavers concluded
that a decline in damage and better
enforcement have combined to
make vandalism much less of a
problem than in the past.

The signs were ordered into the

Dr. Ruth Westheimer spoke
frankly to a standing-room-only
crowd in the. auditorium of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union about the various
aspects of hmrran sexuality.

Sex’ is a private matter, stated
Westheimer, but tﬁere is a shared
obligation to create a sexually liter-
ate society. Her recipe for satisfying
sexual relations is as straightfor-

ward as the woman herself — birth -

control, communication, consenting
partners and dispelled myths.

The crowd of about 700, mostly
students, responded to her warmly
throughout her twio-hour appear-
ance. There were moments of laugh-
ter, but‘ it was between adults rather
than juveniles.

For instance, -one ' student asked
her/whether the size ofa man’s hands
or feet gave any clue as to the size of

his penis. She shared a laugh with
' the audience‘ over thequestion and

then dispelled that comparison as
b’e‘1'ng'a common mytn.

She opened with some frank talk
about masturbation. ‘She said one
myth’ that still prevails today is that
masturbation \among males will
grow hair on the palm or lead to
baldness, blindness or insanity.
Another notion, she added, is that
women never masturbate — a state-
ment that evoked another round of
laughter.

Humor in sex is something she

‘encourages. She admits to giggling

now and then, such as the time she
spoke on the David Lettermanshow
about her “funniest” case — a
woman who enjoyed tossing onion
rings on her lover's erect penis.
Something that is treated with
humor is something notsoon forgot-
ten, she said, and that form ofeduca-
tion is her primary goal. She joked

Dr. Ruth speaks frankly to Pittstudents    

about a book that “guaranteed” 30-. -'

minute orgasms.
Westheimer believes that each

person is a sexual being from; birth ‘

and deserves satisfying, guilt-free’
sex. Sexual ignorance, she teaches,

leads to sexual unhappiness. Since '

she considers herself “old fashi-

oned,” she believes that sex should _

be a private function and that the
notion of this privacy should be
taught at an early age.

The birth control methods she
advocates are the condom and the
diaphram

love-making process rather than as a
burden or an interruption.

theimer leaves to a woman and her
doctor. 0

Communication is essential to

good sex, Westheimer stated. Even"

the best lover can’t guess what a
partner needs or desires. She advo-
cates communication, but one not
dependent upon words; she is also
strongly against the “confessional”
traditions of some sensitivity train-
ing methods. Westheimer stated
again and again that she never asks
personal questions and that partners
should know where and what sexual
experiences_ or fantasies can be
shared. ' ,
She gave examples, however, of

why it is important to air sexual”

problems. She spoke of people hav-
ing experiences or feelings that they
are unable to understand or accept
and she spoke of the unhappiness
this ignorance can cause: the non-
orgasmic woman, the premature
ejaculator, the sexually abused indi-

vidual who cannot enjoy relations j

with their chosen -partners.
Westheimer had no definition for
the term “good lover,” but she

cal practice, sex is better within rela-

classrooms by Classroom and Sche-
dule Manager LaCivita at the Office
ofthe Registrar. He said he had the
signs installed because "of the
amount of graffiti inthe classrooms
and the cost, of removing it. “You
have to keep a few steps ahead of
them," LaCivita said.

The cost of removing graffiti can
be enormous. He cited one case
where a single individual cost the
university over $20,000 a few years
ago. “He just defaced everything he
could,” lamented LaCivita. He
explained that the vandal must have
been angry at a certain professor

because he was-scrawling “sexual
references” about the instructor.
The perpetrator was eventually
tracked down.

It is not the individual but the
accumulation of bored students
scribbling on the tablet arms of their
desks that makes the costs mount,‘
LaCivita explained. He was espe-
cially irked by graffiti detailing sex-
ual acts and detailed drawings or
pictures of an obscene nature.

the employers.”
An internship should not be con-

. fused with a job. Most interns do not

receive monetary rewards for their
endeavors. The rewards lie instead
in gaining valuable experience in
their chosen professions —— learning
by doing. According to Ms. Slappo,
an intern may also receive university
credits provided that they meet uni-
versity requirements.

The office, under the supervision
of Cynthia ‘Vanda, has been open
since October of 1978. Since then it
has fallen upon some difficult times,
however. Due to budget cuts, Stu-
dents Affairs could no longer afford
the full-time office in Schenley Hall.
The service is now provided through
the office of the provost.

There has been some controversy
over Mondale’s running mate. Ger-
aldine Ferraro. However, Leopold
commented, ‘‘I‘m not hesitant about
her qualifications. Ferraro can stand
with the best of them. I. feel as confi-
dent in her as I do Mondale.”

Jay Nalli, Pitt’s main coordinator

Ms.Vanda explained how the
office was saved, “The provost’s
office was concerned that the service
still be provided, so they got a
budget together for it.”

The provost’s office originally did
not have a budget for the service and

'as a result had to cut hours to part-

time. It is now opened on Monday,

. Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m.

to noon and 1-5 p.m. in Room 817 of
the Cathedral. The files have been
updated and the job opportunities
from employers have been pouring
in.. The only thing that is missing to

Defector

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

“Nothing is settled in Poland. It is
only a matter of the next discontent
and in what form that discontent
will take.”

The 54-year-old former Polish
ambassador to Japan spoke calmly
as he preached the harsh realities
facing_ the motherland that he
defected from in 1981.

“It’s only a matter [of] when all
this will explode,” he said.

Zdzislaw Rurarz spoke to an
audience of graduate students and
faculty of Pitt’s Eastern European
Studies department on Monday as
part of_ his tour of American univer-
sities with the Overseas Lecture
Program. ‘

The former high-ranking Polish
official ﬂed to the American
embassy in Tokyo, seeking political
asylum for himself and his family in
December of 1981, when martial law
was declared in Poland. He was
sentenced to death by the Polish
government the following year.

Mr. Rurarz, who since his defec-
tion to the United States had made a
point of speaking out loudly against
the Soviet military threat, spent the
first half of his talk at Pitt discussing
the dim future of his country and his
reasons for defecting. \

Rurarz was the Polish economic
advisor to the U.N., representative

: and participant in Soviet “think

tanks” used to “win the war against
capitalism,” and ambassador to the
Polish embassy in Japan, which was
active in supporting the Japanese
Socialist and Communist Parties.
He himself joined the Communist
Party at" the’ age of fifteen. Yet,
Rurarz states that he has accepted
positions in the Polish government
only to represent the Polish people.
He claims that he became disillu-
sioned with the Soviet system during
the Czechoslovakian crisis of 1968
but “saw no choice at that time."

“I always believed that something,
somehow could be changed,” he
said.

Speaks

take place, and that extreme anti-
German propaganda from the Pol-
ish government spread throughout
Poland makes him suspicious ofmil-
itary intentions.

When one student from the
audience disagreed with Rurarz and
expressed his opinion that the Soviet
need for a calm and cooperating
Poland was only for security pur-
poses and that perhaps no aggressive
plans were in the making, Rurarz
became livid. He said there was no
basis for the student’s remarks and

-his own comments could not be sup-
ported only. because there were no
notes to the Soviet military meetings
he had attended. Rurarz claimed
that the Soviets felt no conventional
military threat fr_om Western
Europe and such security was not
needed.

“Soviets have become, perhaps,
militarily superior to any other
country in the world,” he said. “I

' know that most of the people in this
country don’t believe that.”

Zdzislaw Rurarz ended Monday’s
speech discussing the subject that he
had probably hoped he would not
have to touch on.The Pitt audience
seemed more interested in the
former ambassador’s knowledge of

' the Soviet military threat than the
problems facing the Polish nation.
Though Rurarz was able to defend
his views on the military enthusiasti-
cally, toward the end of the lecture
he seemed slightly dismayed. After
the intensive questioning, he closed
with the comment that “Poland
must go free.”

there to speak his opinion, and that
he openly criticized the Soviets in
many instances. As a former official,
he was trusted for his ability in eco-
momics and _ his criticisms were
apparently tolerated. Rurarz men-
tioned a time during the

quarreled with a Soviet official from

Solidarity and Polish trade with the
West. The current bad economic
situation in Poland, the extremely

. lowered standard of livingin Poland

now, compared to that of 1975, and
frozen investments “equal to the
yearly American GNP” show a
situation hopelessly out of control,
he said. Improving _the economic
situation in Poland at all would
require, he said, the importation of
at least $1 1 billion of Western goods.
The actual import for this year in.
Poland will probably only reach
about $4.7 billion. Mr. Rurarz feels
that the “I8 months of freedom
[Solidarity] in Poland opened many
eyes” and he expects the Polish peo-
ple to react when things continue to
worsen. Rurarz welcomed Solidar-
ity leader Lech Walesa into the Pol-
ish embassy in Tokyo in 1981 despite
warnings from Soviet and Polish
authorities. I
During the question and answer
period at the end of the lecture,
Rurarz’s attitude changed from
calm to irritated as the audience
began to touch on the topic of Soviet
military tactics. The former Soviet
think tank member mentioned pain-
stakingly thought-out Soviet plans
for expansion into Western Europe.

Sound of Silence

The health of live music in Pittsburgh is critical. Pitt students
really just have one local club for good live music, The Decade.
There is a smattering of others in the area — Graffiti, if they
ever get their act together; The Electric Banana, if you’ve got
ear plugs and good walking shoes — otherwise, it’s the corner
of Rock and Roll (Atwood and Sennott). '

The Decade gets some of the best bands anyone could ever _
ask for and they run the gamut of rock ’n’ roll: The Pretenders,
The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Norm Nardini and the Tigers,
The Police, U2, The Houserockers, Pat Benatar, Cyndi
Lauper, and now Bruce. There’s no denying that whoever is
responsible for getting talent in the Decade does a hell of a job.
So what’s the problem with the rest of Oakland’s bars?

The Sanctuary looks awful. Inside, the place is a pit, but its

location is outstanding. The bikers left a long time ago; with a

little work, it could be a great place for music. Zelda's and
‘Danny's look somewhat better, but they; too, just take our
money and give us nothing but the same bar scene one could see

in any dump along Rt. 66.

We encourage local nightclub owners to support live bands
in the area. Pitt students can hasten this occurrence by making
it financially rewarding for a bar to have good live music.

Quite possibly, Pitt students don't realize the financial power
they possess or the economic blackmail they could exercise in

--Oakland. Pitt students pump thousands of dollars into the

Oakland economy.

_ The opening of an Oakland Primanti Brothers is not such a
new idea to Primanti’s. According to one employee, Primanti’s
has been trying to get into the Oakland area for two years. After
all, it’s the Pitt students’ dollars that make Oakland such a
desirable place to have bars, pizza shops and junk food stores.
We drink a lot of beer (reportedly, the “O” retails more beer
than any other place in Pennsylvania) and eat a lot of pizza and

other junk.

Essentially, we paid for all the Caddies and furs for the
owners of these places. We paid for it — we ought to get what
we want, or we'll take our business elsewhere.

Most college towns are dotted with live music halls, cheap
places to listen to local musicians. Oakland is depressingly

lacking in this area. The Decade is great, but they need compe-
tition and we need a choice. With just the Decade to rely on, live

music in Oakland may go from critical to terminal.

Letters to the Editor

A new use for

‘ I , ' C

P1tt s stadium
“University” is defined in Web-

ster’s New Collegiate Dictionaryas

“an institution of higher learning

providing facilities for teaching and

research and authorized to grant
academic degrees . . . ” Nowhere in

. that deﬁnition do I ﬁnd anything

about college football being an inte-
gral part of a university. And thus, I
arrive at the point of my letter ——
football at the University of
Pittsburgh.

After paying,$l3 to watch Pitt
lose to BYU, $13 to watch Pitt lose
to Oklahoma, and then listen to Pitt
lose to Temple, I sat down to do
some thinking. Why should I pay
hard-earned cash and spend valua-
ble time to support a losing football
team? I could‘nt come up with a
good answer until I had to find a

parking space in Oakland the other ,

day. I no longer had, to buy a foot-
ball ticket to watch the football

team; I could buy a parking permit. -

Instead of playing football in Pitt
Stadium, the University could con-
vert the stadium into a huge parking
garage'— perhaps ten levels, holding
The football
coaches would supervise the football
players who would earn their way
through school by being parking
attendants. The coaches could, tell
the players when to block traffic,
create holes in the line, go out for a
parking pass. This new system

_ would ensure that football players

got an education and some practical
work experience.
would be the alleviation of the park-
ing problem in Oakland and lots of
publicity for the_ University. After
all, how many universities turn their
stadiums into parking garages and
make a determinedeffort to make
their schools “institutions of higher
learning”?

Other benefits _

I recommend that the administra-
tion take a poll and I’d wager that
unless the Pitt football team starts
winning, we'll be parking our cars in
Pitt Stadium instead of our
derrieres.

We win a few
and lose a few.

Your recent editorial regarding
the Port Authoritv of Allegheny
County succeeded in bringing to the
university community's attention a
critical problem facing the Pitts-
burgh area. Our mass transit system

is in dire straits financially and its
operations do leave a lot to be
desired. However, your noble
motives for addressing this situation
do not excuse you from the responsi-
bility of getting your facts straight.

You stated that the general
monthly pass costs $40 when in fact
it has been sold for $35 since July l,
1984! You stated that the student
version of a monthly pass costs $35
plus l0.cents for each ride — these
passes are for elementary and high
school students only and therefore
have no relevance to a college stu-
dents transportation‘ needs. You
stated that the U-Pass booklets once
contained 25 tickets which could be
used in lieu of the one-dollar fare

when in fact, the booklets contained ‘

25 tickets prior to October, 1982
when the fare was only 75 cents!

A second aspect of your editorial
that I am compelled to address is the
section dealing with the elimination
of the policy allowing students to
receive free transfers when using U-
Tickets. It should be noted that
when PAT proposed this change in
the summer, it was in the newspap-
ers and was included in the agenda

of a public hearing held on May 9 (a



hearing at which anybody could v

reserve time to testify on proposed
changes). Attempting to mobilize
opposition to this student fare hike,
I found my countless messages and
notes to _ the Student Commuter
Association going unanswered, des-
pite the fact that this organization
had summer hours. The Pitt News
even published a letter of mine that
brought the entire matter to the stu-
dent body’s attention and included
the address of where to write to have
objections read into the public hear-
ing’s transcript. As it was,/I was the
only student to testify on behalf of
students at the hearing and to my
knowledge, PAT did not receive any
angry letters from students voicing
objections to the policy change.

The policy change was enacted
without much of a fuss. The point is
that perhaps rather than sitting back
and complaining about public pol-
icy, students should instead pursue a
more active role in community
affairs. You won’t always win, but
your efforts are not totally without
reward —— the satisfaction received
from trying to make a difference and
the practical education gained from
working with (against) the system
make it worthwhile. I sincerely hope
that students wishing to play a less
aggressive role in the system will at
least remember what Nov. 6 is. ‘

As it stands now, PAT Chairman
Jim Roddey agreed to hold meetings
with the 52 schools selling U-Tickets
in order to hear and consider the
needs of their respective students. I
am currently serving on the Allegh-
eny Transit Council and will utilize
my position to try to get student
beneﬁts restored. In the meantime,
remember that in a lot of cases,'your
voice can (and probably would have,
in this instance) make a difference.

Somewhere in Oakland/ William Pierce

Meese still unworthy of trust

Last semester in this column, I
wrote that Ed Meese, President Rea-
gan’s special White House counse-
lor, should not be okayed by the
Senate as U.S. Attorney General.
But just recently, a special govern-
ment investigator said there were no
illegal transactions committed by
Meese in his financial dealings. This
should in no way clear Meese’s path
toward the Attorney General’s job.

To hold such a position" as Attor-
ney General, a person's record must
not only be free of criminal acts but
also free of unethical or suspicious

goings on. The auestionable manner
this manner, but to allow this is also

in which Meese has handled his
financial affairs, plus his patronage
policies in federal job hiring still
should be of great enough concern

,to block his nomination.

For other countries such practice
may be all right [such was a great
deal of feelings over Watergate], but
in - the U.S. this kind of behavior
should not be tolerated. Public offi-
cials, elected or not, hold and carry
the trust of the people ofthe U.S. To
allow unethical or suspicious behav-
ior is not only wrong because it

Democratic’
supporters meet

A small group of Democratic sup-
porters met last Tuesday evening in
the William Pitt Union to discuss
what can be done on campus to pro-
mote the Mondale-"Ferraro ticket.
They were also interested in getting
students to register to vote.

The students who attended the
meeting appeared to have mixed
feelings about their party’s chances.

“I still feel confident in Mondale,
regardless of what the polls say,”
commented John Leopold, a stu-
dent supporter of the Democratic

party.

a.m. and 5 p.m. where voting regis-
tration forms can be received.
Forms can also be obtained by stu-
dents at the Governmental Rela-
tions Committee located on the 6th
ﬂoor in the Student Union.
Anyone interested in campaign-
ing for the Mondale-Ferraro ticket
is asked to contact the committee.

g Despite the fact that major polls
indicate Ronald Reagan running
ahead of the Democratic ticket, sev-
eral Mondale-Ferraro supporters
still feel conﬁdent about their choice
of candidates.

Sexuallyspeakingl

continued fr0m Page one
“one-night stand” is an unsatisfac-
tory experience for most people.

She believes that most people
want a significant partner —— one
person to whom they belong. The
sexual excitement within the
extended relationship should never
be taken for granted, she teaches,
but should be cultivated and cher-
ished.

Homosexuality and abortion are
two issues that she approaches clini-
cally. She explained that she is not a
theologian or a politician and

refuses to be drawn into moralistic.

judgements. She treats homosexual
couples with the same techniques
she uses with heterosexual couples
and often for sililar problems. She
said dreams or fantasies about
homosexual experiences are not
proof of strong homosexual inclina-
tions. Some people even go through

I a phase of homosexuality and then
revert to partners. of the opposite

sex.
Abortion is a_ right rather than a
legal issue in her view. But she does

. not condone irresponsiblity and pla-

ces stress on sex education, espe-
cially on birth control.

“Nobody ever died from not hav-
ing sex,” Westheimer said of the
pressure on young adults to have
sexual relations. Those who believe
in virginity until marriage have a
right to be supported by society, she
said.

She is skeptical about the idea of
the G spot, an area in the vagina next
to the urethathat is said to bring
tremendous pleasure if properly
stimulated.

She bases her opinion on data
from the Kinsey Report and the
Master and Johnson experiments.
She believes the G spot phenomenon.

   
 

is not ‘well documented enough to be
considered seriously.

She also advised against a practice
advocated by one physician who
removed his wife's clitoris hood,
claiming that it gave her immense
satisfaction.

Her radio program is regarded
highly, she said, even though she
speaks about sex explicitly the
whole time.

She hopes that reputation will
continue now that the program has
gone nationwide with a toll-free 800
number. Dr. Westheimer can be
heard in Pittsburgh on KQV-radio
at l0 p.m. on Sunday.

She concedes her frank-talk radio
show is not for everyone and advises

V any listeners who are offended or
uncomfortable to “switch to a classi-
cal music station.”

In responding to audience ques-
tions, she dispelled the myth equat-
ing penis size to a woman's sexual
satisfaction; she suggested alterna-
tive positions or the use of pillows to
alleviate any vaginal discomfort.

She explained each function of
the stages of sexual arousal and said
all sexual fantasies are good unless
they involve violent acts. She left sex
during pregnancy as something to be
resolved between a woman and her
gynecologist.

Certain foundations in moral and
ethical values are set at a very early
age, "she said. She believes that the
sex lives of children are the business
of children themselves and that ever-
ything that happens in the private

bedrooms of consenting adults is
fine as long as they don't hurt them-
selves and" as long as they responsi-
bly practice birth control

By Christian Gauthier
The Pitt News

People asked me, "How did you
get to be a sex therapist?" I'll say
this: When I was a little girl, I never
dreamed of being on the radio and
answering people's Sunday night
questions about premature ejacula-
tion or failure to orgasm,‘ that I
would be the lady with the German
accent'who surpises people who turn
the dial to WY1,_VYfrom 10 to 11 on
Sunday night, who talks about
penises and vaginas and oral and
anal sex and things like that. Some-
times people are shocked by my
openness and by my taking such
shocking questions in stride. Then I
might shock them also by not treat-
ing the subject of sex as the most
solemn business in life. A“-man said
his girlfriend couldn't get enough
sex, was wearing him out. "Go to the
movies instead, " I told him. It only
makes sense. You don't have to go
crazy to have a sex life.

—— From “Dr. Ruth's Guide to
Good Sex,” Chapter One: The Need
for Sexual Literacy, p. 7)

She was bornlan Orthodox Jew in
Germany. In 1939, she was sent to
safety in a children’s home in Swit-
zerland. The home cbecame an
orphanage as she never heard of (or
from) her parents again.

At I6, she was working in a kib-
butz in Israel and then she was offto
the Teachers Seminary in Jerusa-
lem. The year 1951 found her a kin-

dergarten director in Paris, where

lt’s unbelievable.” He went on to
explain that he is concerned about
the image that this sort of misbehav-
ior presents to the many visitors to
the campus throughout the year.

The Signs were ordered in the
hope that it would prevent defacing
of property by making people aware
of the consequences of their actions.

“The environment means a lot to
attract students to the university,
and we want to make it comfortable
as possible for those already here.
lt’s just as easy to keep it clean as to
clean it up later,” said LaCivita.

He said that instructors can. be
very effective in reducing the inci-
dence of this form of vandalism, but
in the past, when he has confronted
them, “some couldn’t care less. He’ll
say that he’s there to teach, not to
discipline, (but) someone must be
reponsible."

When an act of vandalism does
occur it is the responsibilty of Physi-
cal Plant (maintenance) to clean it

- up. Henry Lizak, responsible for
several campus buildings including
the Student Union, said that any
instances were minor in nature and

“nothing to speak of.” Steve Zugell .

agrees with Lizak. Zugell, whose
domain includes the Cathedral of
Learning, said that what vandalism
does occur “doesn’t appear exces-
sive.” And Van Conklin, associate
director for operation at the physical
plant, made it unanimous. He is
pleased with what he perceived as a
low incidence of vandalism. He
stated that it had declined apprecia-
bly in the last three years. “I think
students today are more serious,”
said Conklin,

The campus police are quick to.

point out that vandalism is more
properly termed “Criminal Misch-
ief” according to the criminal code.
Lt. James Watters, assistant director
of public safety, responded that
criminal mischief is a problem,
because it “diverts institutional
resources away fromrareas where
they may be most effectively uti-
_lized." Watters provided statistics
showing a definite decline in the
reported incidents of criminal
mischief. ’

In 1979 and 1980, there were 222
and 219 incidents, respectivly. This
fell off to 202in 1981 and 199 in 1982
and dropped appreciably last year to
a total of 156.

A nine—year veteran of the campus
police, Watters attributed the
decline to what he perceived as a
more positive attitude with today’s
"students. According to Watters, stu-
dents are more aware of what they’re
here to accomplish. The problem

‘ with vandalism, according to Wat-
ters is that “the university must
spend money needlessly because of

somebody’s deliberate misbehavior.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September  I984

Dept. moves discussed

Dan Taylor '
For The Pitt News

Enrollment at Pitt is up this year
with the registration of the largest
freshman class ever. This was
announcedat the first meeting of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Coun-
cil for the 1984-85 school year.

Dean of FAS J. L. Rosenberg
began the meeting by detailing the
many moves currently taking place
on campus. The math and statistics
department has moved into Thacke-
ray Hall, having previously occu-
pied the Mineral Industries building

and Schenley Hall, respectively. The‘

move was complicated by a small
fire. ‘

The computer science department
has been temporarily relocated in
the Mineral Industries building. The
university has been trying to obtain
a building in the Bouquet Street area
for the department but has been
unsuccessful thus far.

The East-Asian and classics
departments have moved from Hill-
man to Thackeray, and the humani-
ties, german and slavic departments
now occupy the 14th and 15th floors
of the Cathedral.

In other real estate news, the uni-
versity has acquired the Jewish

DEBATERS

Community Center on South Belle-
ﬁeld. Space will be rented in that
building in order to help defray the
purchase price. There are no definite

plans as to how the university will.

use the building.

Another topic. covered at the
meeting was enrollment. Class size is
estimated at 2,050 students, -with a
final figure to be out sometime in
October. Enrollment in the School
of Engineering is also up by 10 per-
cent, while the College of General
Studies continues to lose numbers.
Rosenberg said that he thought a
possible -reason for the decline in
CGS enrollment is that more stu-
dents are going to college right out
of high school. This means that the
adult population in need of further
education is diminishing. All in all,
enrollment targets have been met.
When asked about increasing the
number of faculty positions, Rosen-
berg said that because of budget
pressures, positions that became
open have not been filled but will be,
if at all possible.

Albert Chung of thechemistry
department said that his department
is not able to attract top graduate
students. Chung blames the low

salaries offered to teaching assist-s

ants at Pitt. Assistant pay was frozen
last year ‘at’ a level some council
members think inadequate. Rosen-

TOPIC: "CENSORSHIP AND FREEDOM”

berg told the council that Pitt pays
TA’s at a level that is about the aver-
age of other similiar schools. It was
then suggested that maybe average
isn't enough to maintain a quality
program.

Perhaps the most important issue
discussed was the development of a
long-rangegplan for the university.
Since spring of this year, various
committees have been laboring to
produce a report to the'dean‘s office.
The report analyzes each depart-
ment, detailing both its strengths
and weaknesses. With a future
budget of anywhere from +10 per-
cent to -25 percent, it must be deter-
mined where funds will be best
spent. Of course, the findings are not
without dissenting opinions. How-

, ever, the dean's office should be able

to present a realistic picture in its
report to the provost. The findings
of this massive “closet-cleaning" will
be evident in budgeting plans as
early as the fall of 1986.

‘Perhaps the least favorite task of I

the council was the consideration of
a regularized procedure for selecting
F.A.S. members for the Provost’s
Advisory Committee on Undergrad-
uate Programs. After a circular dis-
cussion, the council decided that the
C.A.S. council should elect the com-
mittee members. i .

“I feel like Caesar; I know you

rocks and obscenities at it. And after

entire season’s gone by, the anxiety’s
been so prevalent.

Instead, eight games remain with
a season highlight this Saturday

-against West Virginia. Everyone’s

always so cordial when the Panthers
and Mountaineers engage in some
football. Liken it to the get-
togethers the neighborly‘ Hatfields
and McCoys used to findthemselves
in down by the Kentucky-West Vir-
ginia border.

As has been the case ever since
Pitt readied to face Oklahoma three

' weeks ago, Fazio said, “It’s goingto

be a real test as far as this game’s
concerned. Nothing’s taken the pres-
sure off the offense. WVU is big and
strong. [6-3, 260-lb. center] Bill
Legg, 6-6, 270-lb. tackle Kurt Kehl
are all big guys. They look like
they’ve been there since l980.”

Fazio somehow forgot Mn
Mohawk, offensive tackle Brian
Jozwiak, who looks like he belongs
in the Nebraska cornﬁelds with his
6-7, 285-lb. frame. Fine, so the
Mountaineers’ offensive line resem-
bles Pitt’s. Offensive coordinator
Joe Moore might be and should be
insulted by that, but his — and
Fazio’s — problem right now is to
convince a Pitt offense that it can
score points.

“We’ve shown no improvements
on offense,” Fazio reaffirmed.
“We’ve gone backward and shown
no consistency. Teams show
improvement going from their first
through third games. We haven't
done that."

Fazio forgot to mention direction.

' , Pitt threw the ball 86 times the first

two games and scored 24_ points.
Last week the Panthers didn't even
go to the air 12 times and scored 12.
Obviously, the scoring recipe is
missing an extra egg here or half-cup

of sugar there. Then again, quarter-"

back John Cummings started

against Temple and watched as Pitt .

employed ball-control tactics all

game. Starting tight end Clint Wil-

son removed his cast last week and
might play next week after suffering
a broken ankle in fall camp. Run-
hungry Chuck Scales, after moving
to ﬂanker last week and not seeing
any live action, likely will re-emerge
at- tailback to replace the surprising
freshman, Charles Gladman. And
starting center Barry Pettyjohn will
relieve freshman Ed Miller, who
started last week after Pettyjohn

‘ hyperextended an elbow.

“When everyone’s healthy and
Wilson is in there,” Fazio promised,

“we’ll be a goodfootball team. It’s '

difficult to expect a win when we
have a freshman center, a new quar-
terback and don’t have the players
out there who should be-playing. I
can't fault their effort, because
they’re trying.“ ,

Trying doesn't conceal the choke
tendencies Pitt’s‘ exhibited since
playing Penn State last year. In each
of their last four games, the Panthers
have not been winning because of
late mishaps, -

Consider: I

0 Ohio State's Mike Tomczak hits
Thad Jemison with a winning TD
pass with 39 seconds to go. A ~

0 Brigham Young’s Robbie Bosco
finds tight. end Adam Haysbert with
a minute and a half to go, putting the
Cougars ahead for good.

0 Maybe not late in the Oklahoma
game, but Pitt still surrendered a 21-
IO deficit in a contest that the Soon-
ers turned into a rout.

0 Then last week the impossible
occurred. Pitiful Temple wins on

Jim Cooper’s field goal with 26

seconds ‘remaining.

It all leaves Fazio in a very unenvi-
able position, akin to the lovable
factory stiff who hands out the pink
slips. Yet, who’s to fault Fazio for
continually emphasizing that it be
him to whom the blame is directed?

“I’m no punching bag and no
one’s going to quit the team," he
said, “but it's the crisis. Maybe
something good will come out of it.
lt’s not the crisis itself, but how you
handle it, and we’ll come out of it.

“Not immediately, but
eventually.”

That eventuality might be three
days young.

Gladman leads all Pitt Grou_nd_gain-

Split end Bill Wallace has 18 recep-.

six catches per game rank him sev-
enth in the nation in that category.
Tackle Bill Fralic had nine pan-
cakes against Temple, bringing his
season total to 18. The Panthers
have rushed for 397 yards this sea-

Fullback Marc Bailey, second
behind Gladman, will be lost for

four weeks after suffering asprained‘

knee against Temple. Other injuries
include back A. B. Brown’s tender
ankle that will sideline him for four

Around the NBA...

NEW YORK (UPI) -— The New
York Knicks yesterday said veteran
center Bill Cartwright broke his foot
working out at his California home
and will be sidelined for up to six
weeks.

Cartwright has missed only 15
games in five seasons witmthe
Knicks, but now he’s “doubtful" for
the NBA opener Oct. 27.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
Washington Bullets traded guard
Bryan Warrick to the Los Angeles
Clippers for a third-round draft
choice.

Warrick was the team’s second-
round pick in the 1982 draft. He
averaged four points in 43 games
with the Bullets in the 1982-83 sea-
son. He was waived by the Bullets
during training camp last year, but
re-signed a month later. Last season
he averaged two points a game in 32
games. V

PORTLAND, Ore. (UPI) — No.
1 draft pick Sam Bowie hasreached
an agreement with the Portland
Trail Blazers. The deal reportedly
will make the former Kentucky cen-
ter the third-highest paid rookie in
NBA history. Bowie, 7-1, was the
second player chosen overall in last
summer’s draft.

To all Pitt Students:

We never needed your help as much as we do this Saturday at Pitt
Stadium when we square off against one of our top rivals, West
Virginia University. _

We need to have you cheering as loud as you can cheer for your
fellow students who play on the Pitt football team. You have to get
behind them. A ,

You have to stay with this team the whole year. You can’t get down
and we can’t get down because things didn’t go our way in the first
three games. We’re fighting a lot of negativism, and we have to fight it
together. Let’s show our true colors. ‘

. We’re fighting a lot of criticism, and some of it may he deserved, but
we’re going to try to take the field with the most positive attitude
possible. ,

Your fellow students on the football team haven't had much success

i this season, "so we need your support.

One of our tri-captains, Troy Benson, said it best: “No one’s quit-
ting.” And he also said, “Even though we’re 0 and 3, there's no place
I’d rather be.”

That's the spirit we need. Get behind Benson and all our boys this
Saturday. We know West Virginia will be sky high and their fans will
be heard from. Let's make sure we show them whose side we’re on.

Hoopies set to hoot ’n holler

Times change. I remember the
days when the Pittsburgh Pirates
and the Cincinnati Reds would bat-
tle for the right to go to the World
Series, when Franco Harris was a
running back, not a stumbling one
and when the Pitt Panthers lost one
game a year.

During my first three years at this
university the Blue and Gold only
lost three ballgames. This season ,
they have lost that many in four
weeks. I am tired of going home and
having to explain why the Panthers
fall every week. You would think
that I was the coach or something.

But now it is time to get serious. I
mean really serious, not like last
week at Temple. Who can really get
serious about playing a team called
the Owls?

This Saturday Pitt will be invaded
by a strange and almost indescriba-
ble life form unlike any other in the
galaxy. The Hoopie.

A Hoopie is something like a
rowdy Rip Van Winkle. He is about

By Jim O'Brien
For The Pitt News

Henry J . Suffoletta has toiled on a
chain gang for 18 years, not because
he owes a debt to society but because
in his honest Midland-like mind, he
owes a debt to the University of
Pittsburgh.

This explains why Suffoletta, a
successful insurance salesman for 21
years for Northwestern Mutual Life,
comes down from his tower in the U.
S. Steel Building to be part of the

"\‘\“\

20 years behind the times, has a still
out back and will shoot you just
because he thinks you look funny.
Except for the annual tag team
cow wrestling matches, there is
nothing a Hoopie looks forward to
more than a chance to beat the city
boys from Pitt on the football ﬁeld.
Last year, the West Virginia
Mountaineers got the best of the
Panthers and everybody south ofthe
border was in Hoopie heaven. All
year, l‘ve had to listen to these good
old boys hoot and holler. No more.
This Saturday the Panthers have
to win. If not for pride, then for the
safety of all the men, women and
children in western Pennsylvania.
See, if the Mountaineers beat the
Panthers two years in a row, the
Hoopies will get real cocky and then
one of them will drag out his old
Confederate uniform and start talk-
ing about how if they can beat us in
football, they can take us at
anything.
Then, before you know it, they

Pitt football picture at each home
game on the Oakland campus.
Northwestern is known as “the
quiet company,”and Suffoletta likes
to low-key it away from the football
field, so working on the so—called
“chain gang” - those are the guys
who carry the chain that’s used to
mark off 10 yards and give the
offense a goal to meet in that next
first down — gives him an opportun-
ity to do something zany.
Suffoletta is a former Pitt football
player. Helettered as a lineman in
1958 and was a member of the 1956
Gator Bowl squad. He roomed one
year with present head coach Foge

“PANTHER

will all get their squirrel guns and
start marching north. No one will be
safe from them. They could overrun
the north and then try to take over
the country. Hoopie rule. The
thought of it just gives me goose-
bumps all over.

So Panthers, when you go out
there Saturday it won‘t just be for
pride or respect, it will be to preserve
life as we know it. So Foge, get your
boys ready for the battle to drive the
enemy back into the hills for another

year. May the force be with you.
Now for some other good stuff.

National League Eastern Division
crown Monday night at Three Riv-
ers Stadium for their first pennant

Fazio and has been a close friend of
Fazio ever since.

Then, too, he is a member of the
Golden Panthers (the athletic
department’s fund-raising arm) and
does favors for Fazio and his staff at
his Mt. Lebanon home.

“He’s opened his home to many .

assistant coaches and let them live
there free of charge until they had a
home in, which to move their fami-
lies, and Foge Fazio was one of
them,“ said Fazio. “He was my
roommate at Pitt for one year, too,
so we go back a long way.” _

since I945. In front of 5,472 fans,
most of whom came to root for the
Cubs, Chicago took advantage of
Pirate Jim Morrison's two errors
and clinched the title 4-]. At least
Pittsburgh had a pennant-winning
baseball team in town for awhile.

0 Speaking of the Pirates, they
will offer something new for the
baseball fan next year-

For the small cost of $2,695 you
too can become a Pirate for a week
(as if anyone would want to). The
Pirates will be taking reservations
for 60 adults to make up the Pirates’
first Fantasy Camp. The 60 lucky
people who fork over the bucks to
the Bucs will take the field with the
Black and Gold at their spring train-
ing camp in Bradenton, FL.

The package includes airfare,
accomodations, meals (including
lunch in the clubhouse, just like the
big leaguers), a Pirate uniform, daily
instruction and a chance to play in a
regulation game against current and

former Pirates, plus a videotape of

lronmen of the Atlantic Coast Foot-
ball League in 1963, Suffoletta was
the team's business manager.
“Working on the chain gang gives
me a great opportunity to pay Pitt
back for my football scholarship,”
said Suffoletta, 47, a stout-hearted
fellow who escaped the Midland
mills where his father and a lot of
other people once worked when this
was the steel-making capital of the
world.
_ So he is grateful forthe opportun-
ity Pitt presented to better himself in
so many ways. “I figure I have to
work on the chain gang two more
years to repay my debt,” Suffoletta

the game.

I knew the Pirates were hurting
for talent but this is getting ridicu-
lous. What's next, a raffle to see who
makes up the starting lineup‘?

0 Last week, it was mentioned
here that an all-women baseball
team was trying to get into minor
leagues. Since then a few things have
changed.

After the Florida State League
approved expansion ofthe league by
two new members, organizers start-
ed changing some minor details. Ifit
recieved one of the two openings in
the league, (three other teams also
want entry into the league) the team
would not be all-female as originally
announced.

Organizer Bob Hope, a former
vice-president ofthe Atlanta Braves,
said that the team would not be all-
women. In fact, it wouldn’t even be
mostly women. But Hope said there
would be a woman on the team
somewhere.

Sure. Doing the team laundry.

said. “I work about five hours on
Saturday and, over 18 years, I have
put in 540 hours. I figure I should be
paid $10 an hour for this job, so I
need a total of 600 hours to repay my

. $6,000 scholarship.”

“In two more years, I'll have paid
off my obligation,” said Suffoletta.
“I can walk off the ﬁeld as a free
man.”

Not really. Suffoletta was married
this past year to Nancy Abraham, a
counselor at Mt. Lebanon High
School, and she's not quite the foot-
ball fan he is and has other ideas
about where Saturdays might be

better spent in future years.

“Even if we moved somewhere
else,” added Suffoletta, “I couldn’t
stay away on Saturdays. I’d come
back five or six Saturdays a year just
to be on the sidelines. I like it there.

“I get a first-hand view of the
coaches and fans at the game. No
one sees the game like I can. The
electricity that fills the air before a
game really brings me back to Pitt.
This is my institution. I may be an
imbecile’s job, but somebody has -to
do it. After I worked my first game
on the crew, I realized it was an
important job. I said, ‘Hey, they
can't play this game without us.’ ”

Suffoletta is joined on the side-

lines on Saturdays at Pitt Stadium‘

by Jim Dunn, a city attorney, and

Jim Donahue, a zone manager at
Mellon Bank who was once a sprint-
er on the Pitt track team.

“Three or four years after I gradu-
ated,” Suffoletta said, “the athletic
director at the time, Frank Carver,
called me and asked if I would like to
hold the ‘down marker’ at the foot-
ball games. I didn’t even know what
a ‘down marker’ was after playing
four years, but I decided I would do
it. I figured it was a great way to pay
back the university for the scholar-
ship I'd been given.”

rently in his second year as Pitt’s

on the courts, Nelson suook her
head and said simply '“Yeah,
they’re pretty awesome.”

At one point, it appeared that
the Penn State strategy was
planned to the second, with four
of the singles matches all con-
cluding within a ﬁve-minute time
span. “Penn State is an excellent

organization all the way. And
they do not have one player on
athletic scholarship,” said
Dieffenbach. ‘

On one point, there was
unanimous agreement: Penn
State would have little trouble
with Bucknell. ‘‘I definitely think
Penn State would beat them.

This is easily the best girl I've

faced all year,” Colleen Driscoll
said of her opponent, Janet
Whiteside. “It showed out there.
She is a much better player than I
am. I finally started playing bet-

ter at the end; I won a game.”

Dieffenbach remains conﬁ-
dent his-team can rebound from
the past three days. “We should
win tomorrow. That is when the
benefits of playing Penn State
will show."

The Lady Panthers record fell.
to a 4-2 mark. After today’s

home match with Robert Morris
(3:30 p.m., Trees Courts), the
team is back on the road for a’

“I had always been one of the star

the reasons Belcher left Pitt after
only one season.

Houk into Hibernation...
BOSTON (UPI) — Boston man-

ager Ralph Houk said he’s retiring

from baseball at the end of the sea-

_ son. Houk spent four years with the

Red Sox and admitted the decision
to leave was a difficult one.

Until recent weeks, it was
assumed Houk would manage the

little homesick," Belcher explained.
Belcher was Collier’s first recruit
in the Pitt program when he took

‘over as ‘head coach in 1980. He spot-

ted her at a Jr. Olympic tryout where
there were a lot of well-known high
school players. “I was the only Divi-
sion I coach that showed an interest
in offering her a scholarship based
on her potential,” he said. ’
“Other coachs were looking for
accomplished players, and Pat did
not have real reﬁned volleyball
skills. I figured that in the right
environment she would develop into
a good player,” he said, “but she
became disenchanted.” He added
that it was a shame that she left
because 1981 was the year Pitt won
the regional tournament and went

on to finish ninth in the country in
the now-defunct Association of
Intercollegiate Athletic for Women.

Belcher came back and “was an
important part of our success" in
1982, when Pitt was 4l-6 and won
the Big East championship. “She
played outstandingly against Geor-
getown’s No.1 player in that match."

Collier said that Belcher had
improved a lot over the past three
years, despite being plagued by
injuries to her knees and shoulder.
“Blocking is the most important

thing Pat does for our team, and she»

is at times a national-caliber spiker,”
Collier noted. “At times, she is a
devastating spiker, but .at other
times she’s ineffective. She is very
powerful. This year, we’re working

team in 1985. Although his contract
expires Sunday, team owners con-
sistently supported him and offered
him an extension.
>But the 65-year-old skipper said
the rigors of travel were beginning to
wear on him. He insisted that salary
was not a consideration in deciding
whether to return. ‘
Houk is in his 20th major league
season as manager, all in the Ameri-

can League. His career includes two-
.stints with the New York Yankees.

In 1974 Houk moved to the
Detroit Tigers and helped break in

players such as Alan Trammell, Lou

Whitaker, Lance Parrish and Jack
Morris. In October 1980 Houk was
lured from a two-year retirement by
the'Red Sox.

Boston co-owner Haywood Sulli-
van reported the club will take its
time in picking a successor.

Injury-ridden...

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
Washington Redskins have placed

safety Mark Murphy on the injured
reserve list. Murphy, the defensive
signal caller, becomes the eighth
Redskin to go on the injury list since
the roster was trimmed to 49 players
one month ago.

No decision was made on the sta-
tus of linebacker Rich Milot, who
underwent elbow surgery two days
ago. Coach Joe Gibbs said Milot
will probably be lost for at least four
weeks.

The Redskins also announced
that running back Joe Washington
will sit out Sunday’s game against
Philadelphia because of a sprained
knee. In fact, Washington may be
gone for as long as three weeks.

The Redskins also signed line-
backer ‘Trey Junkin yesterday. Jun-
kin is a second-year pro from
Louisiana Tech who was drafted by

the Buffalo Bills last year. He played .

16 games for the Bills but was
released two games into the season.
