Attorney General Janet Reno
explains how citizens can
contribute to redueing  

By Matt Groff
Asst. ."V£’It’S Editor

As youth crime increasingly becomes a
major threatto society, U.S. Attorney
General _Janet Reno said she has traveled
around the United States and talked to hun-
dreds of ex—gang members and juvenile
delinquents. ‘

“Maybe one or two of them were real bad
kids," Reno said. I _

“People don’t understand. that society has
unraveled around these children, leaving
them alone.” . '

Reno’s message to a packed Masonic
Temple auditorium Friday night was to Trust
the People. Her speech, given as part of
Pitt’s American Experience Distinguished
Lecture series, focused on how each citizen

. can do their part to help prevent the rise of

crime.
“The most important thing is how our chil-
dren are being raised,” Reno said.

“Children need guidance and limits, and

punishment must mean what it says and fit
the crime.”

According to Reno, the punishment must
be delivered in the context of a loving and
nurtur_ing environment, which should con-

tion in a similar tnannci‘.

"Too often we send people to prison and
offer them no treatment. job training or
counseling,“ Reno said. “Anybody with any
common sense knows these people will
probably commit another crime when they
get out." '

She said that people who commit a crime
should realize they will be punished, but
that there will also be a chance to be a pro-
ductive member of society.

“If they don‘t think they have a chance.
they'll commit crime again,” Reno said. "That
is especially apparent in children. Most of
the delinquents with whom I talked have
told me they could‘ve stayed straight if they
would've had somebody to talk to, some-
body who cared",

According to Reno, passage of :1 crime bill
sending 5(),()()() community police to the
streets of America is the first step Congress
should take to reduce crime.

“These police would go to the neighbor-
hoods, talk with residents and identify prob-
lems,“ Reno said.

Open forum addresses health, environmental issues

Members of Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action Coalition
and other Pitt" students had a
change of plans when" Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
did not attend an open forum
last week. —

The majority of those students
attending were representatives
of SEAC planning to question
O’Connor about Pitt’s invest-

ment in the Mount Graham tele-
scope. project.

O’Connor was unable to
attend last Thursday’s forum

' because of a scheduling con-

-flict, according to Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs
\X/illiam Harmon. Harmon said
that he and the other university
administrators present would
answer questions for the chan-
cellor as well as they could.
SEAC member Matt Peters
said the group planned to offi-

cially present 1,200 signatures
that were collected during at Mt.
Graham vigil two weeks ago.

The list of student, faculty and

alumni signatures shows that
there is a large concern on this
campus about the Mt. Graham
project, Peters said. ,

Peters also said the vigil,’
which included SEAC, the Black
Action Society, the Campus

Until this generation, Jewish students had little
choice about whether they wanted to be identi-
fied as Jews or not, according to Richard Joel, the
International Director of B’nai B’rith Hillel.

Joel said their upbringing in society and com-
munity involvement deﬁned their -Jewish experi-
ence in addition to religious services.

-“But now, there is hardly any differentiation
between Jewish students and other students,” Joel
said. “Each student can choose how their mem-
bership in the Jewish community affects their
life.” —

Joel, was in Pittsburgh on Thursday to attend a
reception in honor of Rabbi Art Donsky, who was
recently named director of Pittsburgh Hillel.

According to Joel, Hillel’s role at Pitt is to mold
a culture where people can meet other Jewish
people and move the community forward. When
speaking a__bout Jewish concerns, on campus, Joel
said theyfare basically the same as everyone
else’s. E .

“Problems like safety and AIDS are concerns of

everyone,” Joel said. “But each student must also
be concerned about their own role in mass soci-
ety and what it is that makes each an individual.”
Joel said there is a small percentage of Jewish
students who will define their college experience
through their religion, but most see themselves as
college students who happen to be Jewish. He
also said the recent trend of multiculturalism in
academics has had positive and negative effects
on students who define themselves as Jewish.
“We have different minorities defining them-
selves ethnically, culturally and politically,” Joel
said. “Minorities sometimes look at a Jewish stu-
dent and say ‘Hey, you’re part of the white major-
ity,’ but many Jewish students don’t feel that
way.” ,_
According to Joel, African-Americans and Jews

have a history of a common agenda and should

begin, if possible, reasseiting that agenda togeth-

er. - v
“Leaders like Jesse Jackson, who is certainly no

apologist for Jews, have come to recognize the

power of a shared agenda,” Joel said. “There is a

real needyfor dialogue between our communi-

dented union” of students and
SEAC wants to know if this will
have any effect on the decision
to abandon the Mt. Graham site
in favor of another.

Harmon said he couldn’t
recall such a coalition in his
tenure at Pitt and that it was sig-
nificant but he was unable to
speak for the chancellor.
O’Connor did relay a message
through Harmon saying that
there definitely will be a tele-
scope and currently there is a

considering of other sights other
than Mt. Graham.

"There is currently the explo-
ration of other sites,“ Harmon
said. “If I were against Mt.
Graham that wouldube good
news to me.”

SEAC acknowledged the
importance of astronomy and
the telescope but Peters said,
“All we want to hear is that Mt.
Graham isn’t an option."

The study of what has never
been seen by supercomputers
that have never been built is
the focus of an award shared by
Pitt with seven other universi-
ties. -

The National Science
Foundation has bestowed a
$3.75 million Grand Challenge
Award to study‘ the collision of
black holes using powerful
supercomputers of the future.

The proposal, sponsored
by NSF to spur the development
of radically new supercomputer
technology through interaction
with pioneering scientific
projects, will join Pitt with sci-
entists at the University of
Texas, the~University of North
Carolina, Cornell University,
Syracuse University, the
University of Illinois,
Northwestern University and
Penn State University.

Department of physics and
astronomy professor Jeffrey
Winicour will head Pitt’s team
of researchers. .

“Black holes are regions of
enormous gravitational fields so
powerful that not even light can
escape their pull," Winicour
said. ,

-“In their vicinity, they warp
the behavior of space and time
in almost every way that has
been conceived in science fic-
tion.

“Large black holes are

thought to be common in the
centers of galaxies,” Winicour
said. ‘
E “Supercomputers. will allow
our group to simulate the
behavior of these intriguing cos-
mic objects without the dangers
or impossibly large-scale engi-
neering requirements of a real
world experiment.” A

The Pitt team will study what
occurs after black holes collide
and gravitational waves begin

traveling outward. The other
seven universities will focus
their studies on the collision of
the black holes.

Albert Einstein's theory of
gravity uses sophisticated math-
ematics to explain how the
properties of space and time are
distorted near large masses. Its
two most revolutionary predic-
tions, gravitational waves and
black holes, have only been

‘verified indirectly.

“This project is on the brink

of science and new technolo—_

gy,” Winicour said. “The gravita-
tional antenna being built, the

' SUpCl'COlTlpLlC€l'S and programs

are allon the edges of our
understanding.” ’

Winicour said the supercom-
puters’ ability to process infor-
mation will have to be substan-
tially improved over what is
available today.

power is equivalent to every

1,000 multiplications of large
numbers and writing out the
every second,”
Winicour said.

These calculations would
have to be performed in a day
or week, according to Winicour.
“Today’s supercomputers may
take 100 years to do the calcula-
tions,” he said.

Ground has been broken
recently for the construction
of the gravitational ‘wave anten-
na and observatories in
Louisiana and Washington
states which will be used in the
research.

The success of these observa-
tories would open a new era of
gravitational wave physics that
would allow scientists to
glimpse the first direct views of
the black holes . believed to
power quasars.

Winicour said the research
project would begin immediate-
ly and is expected to last for five
years.

How does paid overseas
travel, language training, paid
living expenses, medical» and
dental care and $5,400 cash

» sound?

This is what the Peace
Corps has to offer any college
graduate with the desire and
skills to work overseas.
Campus Representative for
the Peace Corps Prank
Hidgon said, “Students don’t
really see the Peace Corps as
an opporttmity. They think of
it as something you have to
endure. They don’t realize if
you want to work overseas
this is really a way to get
moving.”

The Peace Corps is a 11.8.
Government agency that
sends citizens abroad to assist
countries in developing a bet-
ter environment. The agency
originated in Washington,
D.C., by John F. Kennedy. To
qualify for Peace Corps, you
must be a U.S. citizen, at least
18 years of age (if out of high
school, with a few years of

technical training), in good
health and you must have a
skill which is requested by a
country in which the Peace
Corps serves.

According to Hidgon, some
of the most requested degrees
are: agricultural fields,
resource management, educa-
tion, health/nutrition, nursing
and civil or structural engi-
neering. Besides having a
major, some areas request a
specific amount of hours in
certain classes.There are
many advantages to joining
the Peace Corps. For instance,

employers love to see the

experience as a volunteer
overseas. C

“According to Peace Corps
volunteers, they have a non-
competitive eligibility to work
with the federal government.”
Hidgon said.

Hidgon said most people

end up working for the feder- _

al government when they
return. “It is a lengthy

process. If people consider _

applying, they should do so
six to nine months before
they want to leave,” he said.

Peace Corps oﬂers deal to SI‘?/t6l'€1’ll‘S

The application process
consists of threephases —
the nominating stage, the

qualifying stage and the

placement phase.

After reviewing the applica-
tions and interviewing the
applicants, there is a nominat-

‘ing stage. If you have been

nominatedmthe recruiter will
notify you, and your applica-
tion will be forwarded to the
Washington, D.C., Evaluation
Division. At this time phase
two is under way, when the
applicants will be reviewed
again, along with their col-
lected references and medical
history. At that time Hidgon
said, “You will then be‘ invited
to serve as a volunteer in a
particular country.”

After arriving at the loca-
tion, members spend about

three months living with a -

family to learn culture and
language. During these three

"months, they will travel to

their work sites to .oversee the
area and look for a place to
live.

The Peace Corps office is
located in Forbes Quad 4EO1.

benefits Make—A—Wish

By Kelly A. Hanna
For The Pitt News

Pitt females showed up at
Zelda’s Wednesday night to
help out a charity as well as get
a date. ,

‘The Inter-Fraternity Council
sponsored an auction of frater-
nity brothers to raise money for
the Make—A—Wish foundation, a
charity that grants wishes to
children diagnosed with life-
threatening diseases. One mem-
ber from each fraternity was
auctioned off and the highest
bidder on each brother received
a gift certificate .for
Hemmingway’s Cafe.

The event brought in over
$2,000 which is almost enough

to grant one child a wish,
according to Heather Hines, an
intern for the special projects
division of Make—A—Wish. Hines
also said that Pitt is one of the
first schools in’ the country to
participate inthe Wish Makers
On Campus Program. '

“Any amount of money
gained from this event is so
wonderful. Pitt students are
funding a child’s wish and that
has to be an incredible feeling,”
Hines said.

The highest bid of the night
came from Elena Laudaclio. She
paid $255 for C]. Jacobson, a
member of the Phi Sigma Kappa
fraternity. Being the highest bid-
der, she received two 50- yard

the community something struc-
tured to do.” .

Another congressional issue
Reno raised was the possibility
of welfare reform.

“It is necessary, the current
system makes no sense," Reno
said.

“We have women not work-

.ing because they can’t afford to,

women who work -are being
punished.”

Reno has found herself in
the midst of national controver-

sy several times since her,

appointment by Clinton in
March. ,

Her handling of the tragedy at
the Waco, Texas compound

was the first national display of

her willingness to take responsi-
bility for unpopular actions, an
attitude which was evident
Friday night. T

“Gratuitous violence has no
place on network television
during hours when childrien
could be watching,” Re-no
said, referring to her role in
last week’s _congressional hear-
ings on television violence.

"I don’t see much TV, but the
little I have seen doesn’t show
the ghastlyleffects violence has
on everyone involved."

As a state attorney in Miami,
Florida, Reno said she has expe-

rience dealing with the media’s '

effects on young minds.

' “\Y/hen I was asked to prose-
cute 2 Live Crew, I didn’t
understand their lyrics." Reno

said.

According to Reno, her prob-
lem was not with the songs of

the vulgar rappers, but with

their message.
"Since then they have written

songs I would actually compli-

ment them on,” Reno said

Reno is in favor of passing the
Brady Bill and even stronger
measures to curb gun usage.

“'1 am in total support of a ban
on assault weapons,” Reno
said.

“Gun users should be
required to pass a written and
manual test to demonstrate their
knowledge of the weapon, just
like people need to pass certain
tests to drive a car.”

Reno didn’t hesitate when
asked about her stance on the
death penalty. A

“President Clinton knows
I disagree with him,” Reno
said. _

"The only reason for the
death penalty isvengeance

Members said they also met
to discuss recognition of sexual
identity with their own religious
beliefs. 

Some members said they had
negative experiences with their
churches.

“My church is very homopho-
bic. I started teaching Sunday
school before anyone had any
suspicion, but when I did come
out, the church preacher
-flipped out.” member Jodie
Bowser said. .

Other members said they
haven’t come out to their
churches because they fear their
reactions.

“Coming from a small town,
I’m not sure how they're going
to feel about it. I feel like
I’m keeping a part of me

from them because I'm not

plied by BiGALA, “The

The discussion was held in

The debate between academics versus sports has \

ﬂourished at schools of all levels, and Pitt is no excep-
tion. On the college level, many students, and certain-
ly ‘many coaches, feel that the minimum grade stan-
dards that athletes must maintain should be lowered.

On the high school level, this is exactly what the
superintendent of the Pittsburgh Public Schools is con-
sidering doing.

According to the Pz'z‘tshurgh P0st—Gazez‘te, “the 2.0
guideline was adopted in the early 1980’s and has
reduced the number of students eligible to take part in
the extracurricular activities.” “

With the recent and disturbing occurrences of drugs,
guns and gang-related activity in area high schools,
another problem has been forgotten; teenagers coming
out of the school system have been grossly uneducat-
ed. We must find a way to keep teens in school and
ensure their safety, as well as their education.

Lowering grade requirements will not solve these
problems. But barring students from group activities as
soon as their grade average _falls below a “C” will also
do nothing to improve the public education system.

Brashear High School football coach, Ron Wabby
said, “I’ve had kids who come to school only to play
football and basketball. If they can’t play, they don’t
come. They drop out.” (Pittsburgh Post—Gazette).

Keeping people in school is vital, but if they don’t
learn while they’re there, then nothing has been
accomplished. If students lose the opportunity to be
involved, and are prohibited from doing what they’re
interested in, then they could also lose interest in
school. But when schools lower grade standards, they
also lower the student’s standards. ’ ' . '

Instead of kicking students off of teams and out of
groups, there should be a probation period. If the stu-
_d_ent’s grades are suffering severly then that student
should not simply be left alone. The probation period
should be a time when school officials and teachers
offer support and tutoring. If the student works hard
and does notlimprove right away, eligibility should be
extended as long as the activity is not the cause of the
academic difficulties. .

Schools are in dire "need of extra funding which they
are not receiving, but the situation is becoming so
dangerous that it’s time for teachers and the communi-
ty to put in the extra effort. ,

A bask_etball coach at Allderdice High School,
Howard Bullard said, “We’re looking for ways to get

I more kids involved in things, to reduce the numbers

that get involved in gangs.” (Pittsburgh Post—Gazette).

There’s no one answer to teenage gang membership,
but helping students ‘in school and providing alterna-
tive activities for them is a positive step. Lowering
grade requirements will do nothing but make the sys-
tem worse. It’s time to offer moresupportive services
rather than lower educational standards.

Reno offers sound advice against erime

U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno spoke at the
Masonic Temple about crime and punishment
Friday. “

Dr. Robert Hazo, _the head of the American
Experience, introduced Reno by describing the
problems that America faces with crime today.
He said, ‘‘T 00 often crime pays and pays hand-
somely in America as was shown by Iran-Contra
and Watergate where  [those] who violated the
public trust won fame and fortune in proportion
to their degree of guilt.” Hazo

nity policing.” Essentially, what this means is
that instead of riding around in patrol cars, offi-
cers would once again walk a heat.

This allows an officer to become part of the
neighborhood and stop trouble before it begins.
Social workers and public health workers would
provide an officer with resources to deal with
situations outside of the realm of law enforce-
ment.

Reno suggested that this would allow commu-
nities to form a partnership with

also said, “We educators have

in this country. -

the government. This is a sound

not done the best we can  we B e n idea because the government in
must do better.” This remark Washington cannot possibly
set the stage for Reno’s ideas k know the needs of each indi-
for solving the crime problems Jac Son vidual community.

The third major theme was

Reno began by saying it was
time to stop fighting the war on crime with

sound bytes and bipartisan bickering. Instead,

the U. S. should use “compassion, understand-
ing and firmness” to control crime. Part of the
current law enforcement problem stems from
the compartmentalization of government,
according to Reno. In addition, she attributed
her success to trusting the people and said it
was time for Americans to end dissension
among_themselves and, as they have done in
the past, rise to be their best. —

Her plan had three main themes: rehabilita
tion, crime prevention and America’s children.

According to Reno, up to 50 percent of the
current prison population has been incarcerated
for a drug-related offense.‘ The system holds
them for part or all of their sentence and then
releases them into the same environment that
led them to prison in the first place. Instead of
placing people in human warehouses, they
should be treated for their addiction and educat-
ed so that they can find work said Reno.

To her credit, she did say the Justice
Department must make the punishments “mean
what. they say,” and make sure that violent crim-
inals are “put away and kept away." However,
a point of caution must be raised. Rehabilitation
is essential to breaking the cycle of poverty,
addiction and crime, but the non-violent crimi-
nals must know that they have done harm to
society.

What makes me leery of the idea of rehabili-
tating and educating criminals is that there is a
tendency to shift responsibility for their actions
onto society. To assure that these criminals
know the harm their actions have caused, they
should be forced to make pecuniary restitution.
This should go directly to the victim, if possible,
or to charitable organizations.

On the subject of crime prevention, Reno
would like to employ an additional 50,000 offi-

cers nation-wide to do what she "called “commu-

_.\v‘.. -xx.‘-. uni4V.u.vI.“.“.1 u...-.-..

America’s children. Citing youth
violence as the greatest crime problem today,
Reno said it is time to “stop waiting for a crisis
to happen.” According to her, much of today’s
crime stems from the fact that children aren’t
raised properly. Reno cited domestic violence,
broken homes and a lack of supervision as
causes of youth violence.

Children cannot be expected to raise them-
selves. She said America must make sure parents
have time to spend with their children. She also
stressed the importance of schools and after-
school programs. When I spoke with Reno after-
ward, I asked her how college students could
help solve the crime problem. Her answer was
to volunteer in tutoring programs, midnight bas-
ketball or anything that interests you, because
when you volunteer in something you enjoy.
She said some of the most successful programs
were those that involved other students.

While America cannot return to the family unit
of the 1950s, it can begin to look at what it val-
ues and make changes. Schools and programs
should never take the place of the family, but
they can help keep a kid out of trouble.

Reno also set forth the important elements of
the current _Crime bill. These are the community
policing initiative, the Brady Bill, a ban on
assault riﬂes, drug treatment programs in pris-
ons, boot camp programs and getting weapons
out of the hands of teenagers. I

One of her most important points was that
America needs to revise the welfare system.
Reno described how a mother of three would
lose all of her benefits for taking a minimum
wage job. A gradual replacement of benefits
from the government by the private sector
would eliminate this problem.

The ideas I have outlined above are sound
ideas, applied correctly, and America should use
these to begin‘ solving the crime problem.

For the second time in the

an outrnanned and outtalented

“When you’re not winning
too many ballgames, you’re
hungry for a win,” running back
Billy West said. “With this game,
like any other game, we’re
going “out with the attitude that
this game could go any way and
with a few breaks you could
maximize points and strengths.”

West, a true freshman making.

his first collegiate start, took
advantage of a shoulder injury
to tailback Curtis Martin to col-

lect his first 100—yard game of
his short" career. The rookie
rushed for 109 yards on 20 car-
ries. Sophomore quarterback
John Ryan showed more poise

_against the Knights than he has

I shown all season, finishing nine
of 17 for 115 yards and a touch-
down — a back-of—the-end-
zone archer to Junior Green for
Pitt’s second score.

“His confidence is coming

 he’s starting to settle in  get

Defensively, the Panthers
were golden, holding an
offense averaging 40.6 points

in the first quarter, but held on

fourth down the next series. Pitt,

then marched to an eight play,

78-yard drive, capped by West’s

third touchdown of the season.
After Green pulled down the

softly-floating archer in the sec-
ond quarter to go up 14-3, the
Panthers took the second—half
kick—off on a 13—play, 78-yard
drive, that West converted into
his second touchdown of the
game. ,

“Billy had some decent block-
ing, I’m sure, but he saw the
daylight when it was there and
he made every inch and every

the first yellow card for throw-
ing snow at the guy, but I

, don’t know what I got the sec-
ond yellow card for.” I

The sophomore was
promptly ejected, and the
Panthers were forced to play
the final 24:20 a man short.

“[Porter’sl got to control him-
self, and he’s got to focus on
the job at hand and not getting
even,” Luxbacher said. “It
wasn’t just that foul — he was
Chippy the whole game. He
gets a foul and it hurts the
whole team.” '

For the majority of the game,
Panther players were upset-
with whaththey thought was
inept officiating.

“A lot of hard work got
taken away from usiby reff—
ing,” Dyer said. “The situation
of the game lent itself to be
one where guys were pulling
shirts and grabbing, but he let
it go and then he’d call some-
thing. I’m sure we go the worst
part of it, and when I see a
tape of the game I’ll be really 

lost composure, and when we
lost Jeff [Porter to a red card]

. we were playing a man
down with 25 minutes [left] in
the game.”

Po1ter’s red card was the cul-
mination of what became one
of Pitt’s most physical games
of the season. Aside from the
nomial pushing and shoving in
such an important game, the
two teams took advantage of
the inclement weather to
throw snow at each other and,
in two different circumstances,
came. extremely close to a
brawl. 1

“lThe physical play got out
of hand] as soon as the referee
lost control of the game,” Pitt
defender Bob Dyer said. “‘If
he’s going to call a foul on
anything, you might as well
make it a worthwhile foul.”

Porter’s red card came after
he ran into a Georgetown
player going for a free ball in
the second half — as they both
approached the ball, Porter
threw his weight into the kick
and, while he did not come up _
with the ball, got a piece of it
and buried the Hoya.

teams was as simple as the

The next- event was the
celebrity free-throw contest in
which fans competed against
celebrities such as Steeler

Orlando Antigua hits the ﬂoor at the stroke of 12 last Friday.

At 12:00, both teams stormed
out to the deafening roar of the
fans.

This was the fans’ first chance
to meet the new Pitt players.

After the player introductions,

both teams went into warm-ups _

to get _ready for the
scrimmage.

A few minutes after midnight
the men took a full—court warm-
up during which they got to
show off their dunking talents.

were the power dunks of Eric

The women started the scrim-
maging part of the evening with

“I saw a lot of things I liked,"

lowed and once again the star
was senior Eric Mobley, who

Pitt overcomes emotional letdown, beats Zips, Hoyas

The Panthers remain unbeaten in Big East Conference play, but continue to struggle for consistency

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

On the eve of Halloween, it
that the Akron
University women’s volleyball
team had cast some type of evil
spell over the Panthers.

There was. of course, no mag-
ical spell cast on the Panthers.

, There was a logical explanation

for Pitt’s match against a less tal-
ented Akron team which came
into Fitzgerald Field House and
scared the Panthers by easily
beating them in the second
game 15-4.

Pitt’_s loss in the second game
woke them up and brought
them back to reality as they fin-
ished off Akron (15-2, 4-15,15-
8,15-11) and made short work
of Georgetown Saturday night,
sweeping the Lady l-loyas three
games to none (15—7,15—4,15-6).

In the first game against
Akron, the Panthers put on a
clinic as they dominated the
Zips in every aspect of the
game. ‘ .

Pitt gave up a mere two
points and ran the score all the

way up to 15—1 before Akron

scored another point.

easy win in the first game was a
major factor which led to Akron
winning the second game.

“I think that we played so

, well and so strong [in the first

game] that we lost virtually all
focus,” Braziel said. “It’s difficult
after beating a team 15-2 to stay
focused."

Pitt assistant coach Brian
Begor agreed with Braziel.

“One of the worst things a

team can do is to come out and
crush your opponent in the first
game, because it sends a mes-
sage to the players that they
don’t have to play hard the rest

I of the match,” Begor said. “We

weren’t prepared to play game
two. ' .

“If you’re not emotionally
ready [to play], you have to
expect to get beat, and that’s the
biggest thing.”

There were several other
ingredients which caused Pitt to
snuggle.

“We kept expecting [Akron] to
misfire and they didn’t,” Braziel
said. “I feel frustrated for the
girls when they shoot them-
selves in the foot. We made a
lot of unforced errors.” '

Pitt made a total of 23 attack
errors in the match.

when you make a lot of attack
errors,” Begor said.

'Pitt’s Ann Marie Lucanie hit an
uncharacteristically low .156
attack percentage +— her aver-
age is .354.

“Ann Marie is so talented and
a clutch player, but she’s not
perfect  sometimes were
shocked when she errors,”
Braziel said.

Lucanie, however, did have a
match-high; 13 kills and 19 digs.
Middle hitter Jennie Driscoll had
12 kills and outside hitter Carrie
Thorton had 11 kills.

“She [Thortonl was our most
consistent attacker,” Begor said.
“She didn’t have a monster
match offensively  but played
at a fairly good level.”

Appropriately enough, as
Halloween approached, the
Panthers were like Dr. Jekyl and
M1‘. Hide.

After losing the second game
and stumbling to come from
behind to win games three and
four, Pitt (17-8, 6-0 in the Big
East) used an efficient .394
attack percentage from the well
balanced attack of Sarah Mikla,
Sara Mitchell and Driscoll which
sent Georgetown (3-5 in the Big
East) packing with a convincing
three—game sweep.

 

In the first game Driscoll led
Pitt with four kills ' d a block
and continued her play
throughout the match, on her
way to a match-high .625 attack
percentage.

Sarah Mikla opened game
two with a relentless attack.
After the Panthers fell behind 5-
0 early in the game, Mikla gave
Pitt the lead for good by getting
Pitt’s first four points on four
kills and a block. She was sec-
ond on the team in kills with 1.1
and had a .563 attack percent-
age. .
Mitchell played well in all

three games, which led to a

match-high 14 kills and a .480

“This was her lMitchell"sl best

Braziel said she was was real-
ly pleased to see that Miklas.
Mitchell’s and Driscoll‘s attack
percentages were so high.

to see those numbers of

Panthers pound Bonnies, 'Cuse at Trees Pool

By Jeff Kamis
Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team left a big impres-
sion on the Big East as they
trounced Syracuse and St.
Bonaventure in dual meets last
weekend at Trees Pool.

Saturday, the Panthers
opened the.ir Big East schedule
with a 154-87 pasting of the

‘ Orangemen. Many thought it A

would be much more like last
year’s meet, when the Panthers
won the 1 st relay to defeat

_ Syracuse, 121-120.

“We thought it would be a lot
closer, and I think so ‘did
(Syracuse head coach Lou)
Walker,” Pitt head coach Chuck
Knoles said.

Pitt senior captain Zac
Economos, who swam the
anchor leg of Pitt’s winning 400-
yard medley relay team, agreed

with Knoles about how well Pitt
swam against the Orange.

“We absolutely blew them out
of the water,” Economos said.
“We all swam really well, and
it’s really amazing so early in
the season.”

“We’re usually not this fast
until Big East and everyone’s
real excited about that.”

Against Syracuse, Pitt’s divers
staked the team to a 16-2 lead
before ‘most of the crowd had
arrived in their seats. Firs t-
year diver John Soulakis led the
one-two—three sweep by win-
ning the three—meter competi-
tion‘, with sophomore Jeremy
McClean and senior Steve Wolfe
following him in the standings.

After Pitt’s victory in the med-
ley relay, juniors Gary Mule and

"David Williams won the 1000

and 200 freestyle events,
respecti_vely. Junior captain Matt

Brady also took first in the 200
individual medley, and after
Soulakis won the one-meter
diving competition, Pitt had a
89-40 lead at the end of the first
break.

Pitt sophomore Aaron Foitner
then won the 200 butterfly,
beating out Syiacuses Sebastien.
Goulet. Earlier, Fortner held off
Goulet, a
Canadian National Team, in the
butterﬂy leg of the medley relay
to help Pitt to victory. Fortner
said that he was not concerned
swimming against Goulet, who
also holds several Trees Pool
records.

“(Goulet) Swain really fast at
Big East last year, but I felt I

‘should have been as fast as

him,” Fortner said. “I knew I
had him in the 200, and sure
enough, he died.”

swimming
wins two

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swim-
ming team won its first
two home meets of the
season this weekend at
Trees Pool, giving Marian
Cassidy her first victories
as a head coach.

The Panthers (2-1) beat -
a tough St. Bonaventure,
134-103, on Friday, and
Big East conference rival
Syracuse, 152-91,
Saturday.

“We’re really excited for
Marian,” senior tri-Captain
Jennifer Bums said. “She's
doing a lot for this team.”

“I’m very happy,”
Cassidy said. “I’m
extremely pleasecl with
how the girls swam.
They’ve been training
very hard, learning to
swim fast when they’re
tired."

St. Bonaventure started

first place in the meet’s
first five events. But the
Panthers didn't let the

- meet get away from them,
placing second in all of
those events.

“Marian stresses break-

. ing up the one, two,
three’s, and we did that,"
junior Vicki Geubtner
said.

Pitt junior Kara Sixbuiy
broke the Bonnies’ string
of firsts with a first place
in the 1—meter diving.
Sophomores Sunday
Lewandowski and Amy
Spinnenwebber took sec-
ond. and third in the event
respectively for the
Panthers’ sweep.

Pitt went on to take first
infive oflthe last six
events.

started the whole thing and then after that
it was out of hand the whole game,"
Porter said. I - V

Keith Tabatznik, Georgetown’s head
coach, was more diplomatic, pointing
more to the importance of the game as a
factor of the high intensity.

"'It’s not an easy game to officiate when
it’s like that,”.he said. “It was a tough
game, both for the players and officials. I

.think you got two teams playing with
everything on the line, and a big part was
-the emotions of the game, which both
sides let get the best of them at times.”

The Hoyas drew_first blood with Raul
Ferrer nailing the first of his two goals.

- The Panthers answered with a penalty
kick goal at 49:32 of the game by forward
Erik Duffy.

But only 6:18 later, the Hoyas received
their shot at redemption in the form of a
penalty kick as Dyer was whistled for a

‘ foul deep in the Pant_her’s zone.Ben
McKnight buried the game—winner in the
far left corner of the goal. . g

“I should have saved it, I got a hand on
it,” Pitt goalie Kirk Brodows said.

There was much dispute as to whether
Dyer’s actions warranted even a whistle,
let alone a penalty kick. ‘ ,

"‘I just think it was a pay—back foul after
they gave us :1 PK,’’, Brodows said. “lThe
refereel kept saying the same thing over

and over, he kept saying ‘same foul, same
foul,’ and he just gave it to them.”
“That’s the worst piece of bull — it was
a 50-50 ball, and he’s just trying to make it
up,“ Dyer said. "All it was was a make—up
call.”
_ Nonetheless, the Panthers’ Big East and,
for the most part, "95 season came to an

end. They will take on the Robert Morris
Colonials Tuesday in a meaningless non-
conference game, but there will be no
repeat appearance in the post—season.
“There’s next year for me but there's
not one for a lot of the guys, unfortunate— .
ly,” Brodows said.
"'I’m lucky to be coming back.”

Sophomores Sami Vartiainen and Chris
Perry also took first—place finishes to lead
the Pitt attack. Vartiainen, who hails from
Finland, won the 100 freestyle, while Perry
won the 2()() b_reaststroke.

Friday against St. Bonaventure, Pitt
looked impressive by defeating’ the
Bonnies, 145-9_4.

Four different Panther swimmers took

' first place, while McClean and Soulakis

shared the honors with a win in each of the
diving competitions. Pitt dominated the
freestyle events. with Economos, junior

Jonti Bacharach, and Bradytaking the 50, '

100, and 20(), respectively. Sophomore

Chris Balke, who transferred to Pitt this sea-
son, won the 200 backstroke.
Brady said that the Pitt men are beginning

,to perform at a very high level.

“Right now, our team is starting to shape
up really well, we hadsomel great perfor-
mances," Brady said. I

‘''We’ve done an awful lot of talking about
starting to swim_like we should, -and we are
starting to swim like a Top-20 Division I
swim team.”

.“Weihave a very experienced squad, and
we are way ahead of where we were last
year,” Fortner said.

Knoles issued a warning to any Big East
schools within earshot, despite the fact that

the conference championship is still jLlS[
under four months away.

“'We’re gonna give everyone who wants
to take us on all they can” handle, because
these guys want it back and they want it
back badly.”

Saturday, November 6, when it hosts Miami
