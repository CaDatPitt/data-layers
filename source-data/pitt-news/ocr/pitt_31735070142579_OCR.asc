Pitt investments,

endowment drop

Board of Trustees’ audit committee reviews losses

Pitt recorded the largest drop in
assets in its history, it announced-
Friday. 5

The University lost about $541
million, leaving Pitt with almost
$2.6 billion in total net assets at
the _end ofjune. ' '

Much of the loss can be attrib-
uted to a decrease in endowment
investments.

The University also reported

“I just felt like it was good to
give back to the community,”
junior William Mcllhenny said.
Mcllhenny had just returned
from a morning of picking up
trash on the side of the road in
Summer Hill, about 10 minutes
away from Oakland.

PMADD is in its second year

Registration for PMADD be-
gan at 8:30 a.m. in the William
Pitt Union Saturday, and 50 buses
left between 9:15 and 9:30 to
take students to neighborhoods
throughout Allegheny County.

Two groups of students stayed in

Oakland to pick up trash.

About 2,500 students signed
up for PMADD ahead of time,
either individually or through
a student group. Organizations
included students from Greek
life, campus groups such as the
Pitt Democrats and Feel Good,
residence hall floors and groups
of friends. .

African American Alumni Council celebrates campus activism

Members reflect on 40 years of students promoting equality on campus

Carla Trinca-Conley
For The Pitt News

Jack Daniel remembers the
events ofjan. 15 and 16, 1969,
as a turning point for equality
at Pitt.

On those days, students in
the Black Action Society locked
themselves in the Cathedral of
Learning computer center for
seven hours.

Students issued a list of 10
demands to then—Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. Among them
were an increase in the role of
black students, faculty and ad-

ministrators at Pitt, as well as a
black section of the library and
amnesty for protesters, Linda
Wharton-Boyd, president of the
African American Alumni Coun-

cil, said.

"‘There was campus unrest,”
Wharton-Boyd said. ‘ “It was
the time of Dr. King’s ‘I Have a
Dream’ speech, President Kenne-

dy saying there would be a black I
president in the future and civil

rights movements [happening]
across college campuses.”
Daniel, a communications

At Pitt, civil rights advocates were students...urgent, strident and

uncompromising.

Jack Daniel

professor and long—time advo-
cate for civil rights, was a faculty
member at the University dur-
ing the lock-in.When students
released the list of demands,
Daniel met with Posvar on their
behalf. '

“At Pitt, civil rights advocates
were students,” he said, adding

that the protests were “urgent,

strident and uncompromis-
ing.”

Council will celebrate 40 years

Parents responsible

for children’s obesity

f you’ve watched the Steelers on
TV this season, you’ve'probably
seen the commercials advocat-
ing the NFL’s “Play 60” campaign.
The idea is to encourage kids to
exercise for at least 60 minutes
per day toward off obesity. At this
point, the message can’t be stressed
enough. ’
It’s no secretthat obesity rates
have skyrocketed over the past de-
cades. Whereas the ’70s and ’8os
saw approximately 5 to 7 percent
of 6- to 19-year-olds in the United
States overweight, the numbers rose
sharply around the turn of the cen-
tury —approximately 16 percent of
American children were overweight,
according to The Department of
Health and Human Services.
Blame it on today’s selection of

_ video games and TV channels, the

prevalence of processed foods or
the ease of transportation. Obesity

among children is still a weighty is- ,

sue -— an issue that has even caused
some parents to lose custody of their
morbidly obese children.

- At ﬁrst glance, losing custody of
one’s child seems like an overreac-
tion_. Children are more commonly
seized because of domestic abuse or
as a result of living situations that
aren’t conducive to raising children
—— for example, excessive drug use.
These situations seem direct and
clear—cut violations of a child’s
safety and well-being. But severe

A cases of obesity should be looked

at in a similar regard, even if being

overweight is a more common and

acceptable condition. »
The health detriments of obe

- sity range from Type 2—diabetes and

hypertension to high cholesterol,
sleep apnea and more. Needless to
say, there are serious issues that, as

they are preventable, should be ad- -

dressed with the utmost sincerity.

If a child suffered from a more
serious medical condition, such
as multiple sclerosis, parents who
don’t properly treat this'condition
would be looked at as both negligent
and unsympathetic. Should obesity
be looked at any differently? Given
that obesity is an often avoidable
condition and its health effects are
severe, it sure seems comparable.

Several cases in states such as’
California, New Mexico, Texas and
New York have resulted in the loss
of custody of an obese child, accord-
ing to Time magazine. Some of the
cases don’t garner much publicity
because of child-privacy laws. Social
services, before expelling a child
from custody, provide adequate
warning —- a measure that is fair
and necessary. But if warnings aren’t
enough, removing a child might just
be a measure that ends up saving
his life.

There’s no magic body weight
or BMI that should determine the
status of a child’s custody, and of
course, situations are examined on
a case—by-case basis. Some parents
might be ignorant of the real dan-
gers or indifferent to their child’s
predicament. They might not recog-
nize the gravity of their child’s state.
First, they should be educated. But
if they don’t help their child lose

weight, they’re negatively affecting ,

their child’s ﬁ1ture_and therefore
failing to fulﬁll a fundamental role
as parents. '

The key to Enduring Freedom

Kabul is like a pig — in a good way.

 
 
  

‘ Lewis Lehe
Columnist

In May, Afghan authorities locked
up Khanzir. The public was scared
he might give somebody the H1N1
virus.

It was unlikely that Khanzir
was a threat, though. Who would
give him the virus in the first
place?

After all, ever since his do-
mestic partner died two years

ago, Khanzir has lived a lonely A

existence as the only pig in Af-
ghanistan — a country equal in
size to Texas minus Massachu-
setts and Vermont. He lives in

S ‘ the Kabul zoo.

Khanzir is the only pig in
Afghanistan because the strict
interpretation of Islamic law in

most of Afghanistan prohibits the

sale of pigs.
This is how powerful sharia is

_ in Afghanistan, even eight years

after our invasion.

On the other side of the Earth,
President Barack Obama is con-
sidering what to do about more

' serious threats than H1N1. In the

rural areas beyond Khanzir’s zoo,
the Taliban is winning.

Unfortunately, the proposed
40,000-soldier surge will not
work, because the goals of the
troops already in" place are too
vague.

The Taliban will keep winning
until we know how things would
look if we won.

I The U.S. strategy seems more
focused on doing things that feel
like war than on achieving speci-
ﬁed goals. ' ‘

When we send out patrols, just
so the patrols can get ambushed
and maybe kill a few enemies, we
are like people who go to Phila-
delphia and eat cheese steaks
because that feels like a Philly
thing to do: Here we are, killing

MCT Campus

enemies. Feels like a war to me!

Are we trying to kill everyone
in the Taliban? That’s not fea-
sible. V
Are we trying to make the Tali-
ban surrender? It is unclear in
what sense the Taliban’ can sur-
render.

Taliban leaders cannot issue
surrender orders without under-
mining the legitimacy of their
own authority. A

Therefore, I’m laying out a
specified, achievable goal: Main-
tain peace and order in Kabul and

‘ the surrounding Kabul province,

where 5 million of the 32 million
Afghans live.

Why just Kabul?

First, Kabul is a single city and
not a huge one. Controlling Kabul
is plausible.

Second, although no one
makes it official, the United
States is trying to change Afghan
culture. For Kabul, this change is
not a revolution, but a counter-

Lehe 4 7

revolution.

In the 1960s and ’70s, Kabul
was called the -“Paris of Cent'ral
Asia.” .

It was peaceful and rich. Kab-
uli women were allowed to attend
university and even wear what
they wanted. Beautiful urban gar-
dens drew tourists from across
the world.

This era ended because the So-
viet Union invaded, and militant
Islam was what people needed
to stop the Evil Empire —— not
because Kabulis turned on ratio-
nality and the good life.

Third, controlling Kabul would
not risk those ﬁascoes where a
plane blows up a wedding party.

Why will this work?

On the combat side, from a
base in Kabul province, we could
still destroy large—scale threats as
they form in the provinces. Air
strikes destroyed most of the
terrorist training camps within
weeks.

Also, by taking the focus off
the Taliban, U.S. forces could

better occupy themselves with
defeating al—Qaida —— a threat to
our own peace and order.

The Afghanistan mission
could focus on intelligence and
excursions that quash threats as
they form, rather than playing
“Call of Duty” in valleys across
Afghanistan.

On the cultural side, the U.S.
military would never be able to
sow the seeds of a foreign ide-
ology like democracy, but it can
provide a rich soil where Afghans
can grow their own ﬂavor of dem~
ocratic values.

That soil is a city where prop-

erty rights are protected and no 

oneilives infearof physical vioi
lence -— a city where people can
think about investment and en-

joyment instead of thinking about _

surviving this life for rewards in
the next.

In a sense,~my idea is to make
Kabul a larger version of Khanzir
— a unique speck of the outside

world upon which all Afghans .

can gaze.

It would happen bit by bit.

First, Kabuli teens will watch
YouTube videos, learn foreign
languages and play campaigns
with Swedes in “World of War-
craf .”

Later, parents would consider
encouraging careers like engi-
neering to their daughters.

As long as peace reigns, noth-
ing can stop the global society
from creeping into a city like an
H1N1 strand with no vaccine.

Of course, Afghans will fear
Kabul at first, just like they fear
Khanzir. But there is ‘a mere ex-
posure effect.

Kabulis will get wealthier and

‘ ”freer.’The attraction will become

too strong.

Folks will move into Kabul
province or demand liberal re-
forms in their own regions.

Like the East Germans ripping
down the Berlin Wall, Afghans
will tear down walls in their own
minds.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I am appalled by Leah Trimble’s Oct. 14 column titled “Too bold
to get into the bedroom?”

For Trimble to call open and honest communication between
two adults “an egregious failure” undermines the organized effort
to reduce sexual assault and rape incidents on collegejcampuses.
Trimble advises women not to “just kiss someone for two hours,
grope him a few times, agree to go back to his place and then cry to

"him about your ex-boyfriend.” v

Perhaps lack of open communication and honesty causes this
letdown. ' . .

Exactly. what kind of confidence is Trimble promoting?

It’s certainly‘ not sexual confidence.‘ Otherwise, Trimble would
not have said, “Most guys aren’t desperate enough to get with a girl
who’s already been with two other people that night.” .

No, we would never want to encourage women to safely, conﬁdently
and assertively confront their sexuality if it means appearing to be
tarnished in the eyes of the coveted male gaze. ' s

It is precisely the coy ambiguity of “the chase” which Trimble
advocates that leads people to falsely assume the extent of their
partners’ personal and sexual boundaries.

Not pop, not ‘Country,’ but raw rock’n’ roll’

Prize Country resists labels and conformity, sets itself apart from typical radio fare

Liz Keeney
For The Pitt News

Prize Country
With Git Some

The Smiling Moose
Oct. 19

Interested inthe type of music that
concerns itself with staying up late,
havingfun and raising some hell? Nota
bigfan of the T—Pain or Britney Spears
brands of popular music? You might
want to check out Prize Country.

Harkeningback to the decades—old
formula ofloud, fast and rowdy, Prize
Country has made a name for itselfby
playing good old rock ‘n’ roll.

Prize Country — composed of
Jacob Depolitte on guitar, Aaron
Blanchard on guitar and singing lead
vocals, Joshua Northcutt on drums
and Jon P. Hausler on bass — has
been playing its boisterous music out
of Portland since 2006.

A stark contrast to the pop—rock
and hip—hop sound currently spinning
on top 40 radio stations, PrizeCountry
has made a name for itselfby playing
heavy, raucous and fast—paced rock
‘n’ roll.

Accordingto Blanchard, the band’s
music is “loud and intense and urgent,
a little bit of everything.”

. Unlike many of its musical contem-
poraries, Prize Country makes music
for music’s sake, Blanchard said: No
formula, no copied beats, no forced
lyrics. ‘
Inspired by classic rock giants such
as Led Zeppelin and the The Doors,
Blanchard said the band “listens to
differentthings, so oursound isalittle
varied,” and that the result is a culmi-
nation of “just loving and listening to
music.”

After meeting Blanchard in Salt
Lake City, Depolitte moved to Oregon
to form a band with him. Soon after,
Hausler, a bartender at Depolitte and
Blanchard’s favorite bar, joined the
lineup, and Northcutt completed the
roster. 1

Beginning in 2006 with “Dead
Kingdom,” the band’s self—released
debut album, Prize Country has com-

. pletedsevenalbums,includingitsup—

coming release, “With Love.”
Blanchard said it’s easy to write
songs because band members “know
what everyone sounds like.
“Our songwriting processes is
very organic,” he said. “After begin-

” ningwith afew simple guitar riffs, it’s

anatural progressionto write the rest
of the song. Lyricall_y, we’re a whole
different ballgame. We tryto be a little
tongue-in-chee ” ' i V
Instead of the over-processed,
techno-irrfused studio rock that has

dominated the airwaves for the past .

several years, Prize Country pumps
out a more bare-bones sound. ‘

“We initially wrote songs that
sounded better recorded, but after
touring, we came up with
stnffto play live,” Blanchard
said. “Everything ends up
being a little faster.”

Prize Country said it
enjoys playinglive, and that
has kept the band on tour"
for the majority of the year.

Despite the band’s busy
schedu1e—-with morethan
50 shows on each tour —
Blanchard said, “Tour'mg’s ‘ .
not easy and it’s not always
ﬁm, but all you have to do is
think about it for ﬁve min-
utes, and you see thatit’s all
worth it. We’re really killing
two birds with one stone.
We love music and we love
to trave .”

And thefans love the band for it.
“We often see a lot of the same

faces,’’Blanchardsaid.‘‘Youmakealot ,

of friends alongthe way, so you always
want to be invited bac ”

But Prize Country isn’t just inter-
ested in putting on a good show. It’s
really the love of music that drives it.
Blanchard said the band isn’t inter-
ested in makingmoney or hitting the
big time.

“[Prize Country] doesn’twantto ﬁt

' in,” he said. “The industry right now _

isn’t complementary to what we do.”
He said the band enjoys touring
and that conforming to the industry
standard isn’t worth giving that up.
When asked about howPrizeCoun—
tryﬁts into the music scene right now,
Blanchard said, “I don’t think we do,
and I’m happy about that. We do what
we do. We care about music. We have

‘ control, and I can’t imagine someone

telling us what to do.”

Two girls,one show —girlpower at Howlers

Alyse Black and Aly Tadros join musical forces to put on a diverse—sounding yet satisfying show

9 p.m.

What’s better than one up-
and—coming singer-songwriter?
Two singer-songwriters? If you’ve
heard Alyse Black and Aly Tadros,
you’d have to. agree.

Just such a treat will be at the
Howlers Coyote Café tonight when
Black and Tadros perform music
from their new albums, respective-
ly Tadros’ debut, “Things Worth
Keeping” and Black’s sophomore

album, “Hold On To This.”
Tadros is pleased with her de-
but album.

“T

On the night I wrote my ﬁrst
song, I had a really big ﬁnal
the next day and instead of
studying, I wrote this song.

Aly Tadros

“I’m really happy with what
ended up happening. A lot of the
songs really came to life with the

musicians who worked on it,” she
said. “I don’t have to burn -home-
made CDs and write my name on
them with Sharpie anymore.”

The title of “Things Worth
Keeping” came from a conversa-
tion with a friend — to whom the
album is dedicated — about having
too much stuff laying around and
what was worth holding on to.

“A lot of songs on the album
were the process of letting go of
certainlthings,” she said.

Black is also excited about her
sophomore release.

“I’m insanely proud of it,” Black
said. “It was produced by Ryan
Hadlock. He’s worked with The Foo
Fighters and The Strokes, so that’s
a cool club for me to be in.”

“Hold On To This” takes its
name from the last track, of which
Black said, “I can’t stop falling in
love with that song. It hits me so
hard in its simplicity and its sweet-
ness. It’s not necessarily going to
be the radio hit of the album, but
it’s the one that’s closest to who
I am.” ,

Black’s album instrumentation
includes horns, banjos, ukulele and
backup vocals, creating a diﬂicult
sound to replicate on tour.

“I try and get it as close as pos-
sible within the constraints of
touring. Aly [Tadros] will throw
down guitar percussion to add
some drum action or play the banjo
part on her guitar,” Black said.

Tadros said, “I like to improvise

“

a lot on stage, and Alyse [Black] and V
I have fun with harmonies. I make
cracks quite a bit too; we have a lot
of fun with the audiences.” Tadros
and Black take turns performing,
their own compositions but are
usually on stage together.

Black described her style as
“jazz-inﬂuenced singer-songwriter
indie pop,” while Tadros is often
compared to artists like Tom Waits,
Fiona Apple and Rodrigo y Gabri-' '
ela.

Despite her musical inclina-
tion from an early age, Black said
she earned “degrees in everything
but music. I had studied abroad
in Germany and adopted a very.
pragmatic view. I got it into my
head that I had to do something

Tybout: Conservative, liberal
 movie lists unreliable

Andy Tybout
Columnist

Last Monday, my roommates and I discovered

a different kind of movie list: the National Re-

A view’s Best Conservative Movies of the last 25
I years. And no, “Red Dawn” isn’t No. 1.

' I’m, by no means, a political conservative,
but a lot of these movies are also my favor-
ites. For instance, imagine my shock when
I discovered that one of my
favorite ﬁlms of all time, “The

~ Lives of Others” (2006) — a
complicated drama set in the
paranoid gloom of East Ger-

. many — took the top spot.

I What did “The Lives of
Others.” do to earn such a ti-
tle? What point-by-point cri-
teria of conservative Ameri-
can ideology did it satisfy to

. reach the top?

The answer,it turns out, is

 

the story are ﬁrst '— the socialist state was
merely a backdrop for the drama to unfold.

Good movie? Yes. But a conservative movie? .

Not really.

Other movies on the list are equally baf-
ﬂing. “Groundhog Day?” “Ghostbusters?”
Many of these picks are based on a single point
— in the former, Bill Murray ﬁnding morals,
and in the latter, the government-run Environ-
mental Protection Agency being the villain (in
addition to the ghosts, of course).

I felt the impulse to rush out into the
street and drag passers-by in to watch V
the story unfold.

none. It won because William .
F. Buckley ]r., the founder of the magazine,
really liked it. ’

* “This is the best movie I ever saw,”-Buckley

said after seeing the film. “I felt the impulse to ‘

rush out into the street and drag passers-by
in to watch the story unfold.” '

Okay, I’ll give them this: The movie does

_ make life in a socialist state look less than

heavenly — and, I imagine, it was. But of the

things I remember most, the characters and

Not that Top 25 Liberal Movies lists fare
any better. In response to the National Re-
view, the Daily Kos crafted its own countdown,
this one for granola—munching, Volvo—driving

’ communists. .

Its top two movies — “An Inconvenient

Truth” and “Fahrenheit 9/11” — are documen-

_ taries made by famous liberals, and the next

few are as scattershot as the conservative’s.
One movie — Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil” (1985)

A musical side of myself.”

She said that eventually, “Some—
thing kind of snapped me out of
it and made me realize that I was
living somebody else’s dream.
I wanted to let somebody else
have that so that I could do what
I needed to do, and I started sing-
ing on the streets in Seattle.” She
later relocated to Austin,_"‘a hotbed
of songwriting,” where she met
Tadros last year while perform-

ing at a show case called Shut Up _
A and Sing. - -

Tadros was similarly drawn to
music and eventually taught herself
guitar and left college to perform
ﬁill-time. She said, “On the night I
wrote my ﬁrst song, I had a really
big ﬁnal thenext day and instead of
studying, I wrote this song. I kind
of knew instantly that I wasgoing
to ﬁnd a way to do music.”

Tadros said her youth — she‘
just turned 22 — has often worked
to her advantage.

“People really just base a lot on
work ethic. -Being mature, respon-

 

 

' sible, dependable and young is a

great position to be in,” she said.
Both artists spoke warmly of

having each other’s support as

travel mates, as well as that of a

third traveling companion, Tink, ,

a Boston Terrier. Tadros, who has
been on’ the road nonstop since
July, said, “The long stretches of
drives without shows are boring.
Thedrive from Seattle to Austin
was like 26 hours. We could barely
speak English by the end of it, we
were so exhausted.”

Road weariness aside, she said,
“Thetour is going great. We’ve re-
ally gotten the hang of it, so [the
shows] are getting pretty smooth.
It’s a lot offun.” .

Tadros’_New Year’s resolution
was to play concerts in 20 new
states, an ambitious goal consider:
ing that her East coast tour was not
planned at the time. So far, she said
she has played in 17 new states, and
Pennsylvania is on the list.

“I’m really excited — I don’t
think I’ve ever kept a New Year’s
resolution before!” she said.

-—- even appears on both lists.

This can mean only one of two
things: Either “Brazil” is the secret
uniﬁer that can rally both liberals
and conservatives to a call of shared
morals and national harmony, or
these lists are arbitrary and stupid.
As good as “Brazil” is, I’m guessing
it’s the latter.

The National Review lacks clear
criteria for evaluating movies, and
the Daily Kos doesn’t even provide
criteria because its list is based on
polls.

But even in the National Review’s
more obvious picks — “300” and

“Braveheart” —. its arguments are ‘

unconvincing spins, as if the con-
servative message were the objec-
tive of the movie, rather than an
unintended side lesson for already
biased minds.

All of these movies are enjoyable,
and despite what certain slanted
publications would have you believe,
liberals and conservatives are not in-
herently different from one another,
at least as far as entertainment pref-

erences go. They can all enjoy the
same movies because they’re all part
of the same human experience that ,
these ﬁlms seek to emulate.

Good movies transcend the po- .

litical spectrum. They go beyond
the thin, divisive rhetoric that keeps
people entrenched in their own dis-
torted vision of reality, and they do
this by telling stories — humanity’s
greatest artistic invention.

“Forrest Gump” (number four
on the conservative list) isn’t good
because Forrest —— not exactly an
intellectual giant — “is far too smart
to embrace the lethal values of the-
1960s.” It’s good because it looks at
the many faces of the world through
a uniquely human, rather than po-
litical, lens. That’s what movies
— good movies, at least ,— are all
about. _

So unless the subversive political
undertones of “Ghostbusters” sud-
denly strike me, I’m going to keep
watching it with an admirably im-
partial mind. I encourage all of you
to do the same.

Lewis continues to shine Panthers seeking

The freshman running back helped earn Pitt its first top—25 ranking this year

Kyle Craig
Staﬂ" Writer

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — It’s official.
The secret is out on Pitt running
back Dion Lewis. The true fresh-
man isn’t sneaking up on any
more teams this season or, in all
likelihood, for the rest of his'co1-
lege career.
Lewis, a product of Blair Acad-
emy in Blairstown, N.]., and for-
.«mer New Jersey Prep offensive
player of the year, used the Gar-
den State as the location of his
national coming—out party.
During the Panthers’ 24-17 vic-
tory over Rutgers Friday night,
Lewis carried the ball 31 times for

l 180 yards and two touchdowns.

Of those 31 touches, none was
more signiﬁcant than Lewis’ 58-
yard touchdown sprint that gave
the Panthers a 14-point lead in the
third quarter.

9 Pitt (6-1 overall, 3-0 Big East)
remained perfect in conference
play. But Rutgers (4-2, 0-2) must

regroup and attempt to salvage
its season.

The victory also propelled Pitt
to its ﬁrst top-25 ranking of the
year. The Panthers are 20th in the
AP Poll and 19th in the USA Today
Coaches Poll.

[Lewis] is special. I mean, he is
something.”

Lewis is currently the most
proliﬁc freshman rusher in the

country, with 918 rushing yards

on the year, and his 131-yards-
per-game average is ranked third

(5

In seven games, Lewis has scored 60 points, which
puts him on pace to break LeSean McCoy’s freshman
scoring record of 90 points. ’

After the game, head coach
Dave Wannstedt praised Lewis’
ability.

“You know how I am about
talking about our players and
our football team. I’m always
going to be very conservative in
what I say,” Wannstedt said. “But

dropped another close contest
as it fell 2-0 to the No. 10-ranked
Connecticut Huskies Saturday
night in Storrs, Conn.

The Panthers (1-11-1 overall,
0-7-1 Big East) were tied 0-0 go-
ing into halftime as senior goal-
keeper Zack Matthews denied
all of the Huskies’ shots on goal
— en route to six total saves on
the night — to keep Pitt in the
game.

But the Huskies (8-2-3, 6-1-1)

beat Matthews andtook the lead ,

when Mike Pezza corralled the
ball off a deﬂection and ﬁred a
shot past the Pitt keeper just 12
minutes into the half to make the
score 1-0.

The Huskies added to their
lead in the 82nd minute when

games in Big East play.

Kwame Watson-Siriboe tapped
the ball in off a corner kick with
assists from Carlos Alvarez and

-Thomas Wharf.

The Panthers had their best
chance of the game to score when
senior defender Matt Firster’s

side volley off a corner kick»

struck the crossbar to preserve
the clean sheet for the Huskies.

Pitt was out-shot 24-6 in the
game, but the stats overshadow
a strong game against a ranked
opponent.

“The game was pretty close,
even though the stats may not
have read that way,” Pitt senior
forward Chris Wilcox said. “We
had our chancesrbut couldn’t put
it away. Connecticut is a really
good team, and we gave a good
effort.”

‘ Speaking of advertising, my fourth
recommendation for baseball’s sched-

der the tagline “This Time It Counts,”
thewinningleague ofthe All-Star Game
currently receives home—ﬁeld advan-
tage in the World Series.

Selig instituted the quirk to boost
sinking All-Star game ratings and to
appease the media maelstrom that
swarmed after ending the 2002 All-
Star" Game in a tie.

Selig, though, should have known.
that the media scrapes for stories in
the dog days of summer.

Now baseball fans are stuck with
the league basing the location of a piv-
otal World Series Game 7 not on what
team earned it more but how the Pa-
dres’ Heath Bell pitchedinanexhibition

If Selig wanted meaningful base-
ball, he should have focused on ﬁxing
the games in October and notthe one

Lewis: Everything  
happens for a reason

Football 4 12

Fitzgerald (72) and Tony Dorsett (78) on
his way to catching McCoy.

The most surprising aspect of Lewis’
story is the relatively light recruitment he
underwent during preparatory school.

Besides Pitt, Lewis held scholarship of-
fers from only Miami (Ohio) and Tulane.

Despite the lack of fanfare around Lewis, '

Wannstedt didn’t need much convincing to
extend a scholarship offer to Lewis after
. his junior. season. '

“I thinkhis highlight tape was ﬁve plays,
and they were all, like, 80-yard runs. Seri-
ously, I think I watched ﬁve plays and told
[defensive backs coach] Jeff Haﬂey, ‘Offer
him,”’ Wannstedt said.

After Lewis’ productive senior season
at Blair Academy, other teams approached
him to test his commitment to Pitt.

But Lewis wasn’t receptive to the late-
comers.

“I think we got on [Lewis] early, and
then when he went to Blair and had the

big year his senior year. He is such a solid
individual that he stayed with his commit-
ment,” Wannstedt said.

— By securing an early commitment from
Lewis, Pitt was able to take a big-time play-
maker out of Rutgers’ own backyard.

On Friday night, the Newjersey media
asked why Rutgers coach Greg Schiano
didn’t offer a scholarship to the running
back who had just torched his team.

“He?s a very good player,” Schiano said.
“You make choices’ in recruiting, and then

- some choices are made by [the recruits].

But you make choices of who you’re going
to go hard after  there [are] enough -good
[players] for everybody to get some.”

The Panthers appear to have a good one
in Lewis, and he doesn’t seem to be wor-
ried about the under-the-radar status he
received during his recruitment.

“Everything happens for a reason,”
Lewis said. “I’m happy in the place I am

now. .
Despite his youth, Lewis is becoming a

leader and a person on whom the upper-

classmen on the team can depend.
“Everyone on the team trusts me, ev-

eryone expects me to [make] big plays. So '

that’s what—I do. I’mjust,doing what every-
body expects me to do,” Lewis said.
“They really don’t look at me as a fresh-

man [anymore]. They look at me just like ,

one of the older guys, just trying to lead
the team and help get a win.” A

As Pitt gets -deeper into the Big East
schedule and opposing teams begin to plan
for Lewis, the scrutiny is going to intensify
on the true freshman.

But if one thing was learned last Fri-,

day on national television, it’s that Lewis
isn’t afraid of the attention-— even if it
is belated.
