1500 High School Students To Attend

By JACK

Institute Planslieady

OLENDER

On Saturday, Mar. 26, the University will host 1500
high school students from all over the western Pennsylvania

area at the 1955 High School

Publication Institute.

Among the activities scheduled are discussions to be
led by the staffs of Pitt publications and awards for the best
high school publications submitted for judging.

Co-chairmen for the event
under Director of Student Pub-
lications Dr. D. E. Swarts are
James DeWeese, editor of the
PITT NEVVS, and Alan Skir-
boll, business manager of the
OWL. '

DeWeese sees great value in
the annual ‘Institute. “The Insti-
tute serves the high schools in
that it gives them an opportunity
to get critical advice on their
publications from college students
who are turning out publications
which border on the professional.

“Public - relations - wise, it
serves the University to a very
high degree, because it brings
prospective college students
from all over Western Penn-
sylvania,” said the editor.

' Awards for the best student
publications submitted by high
schools will be made at a gen-
eral assembly following the day’s
discussions. Pitt Awards will be
presented to the schools having
the best newspaper and yearbook.

Jack Caldwell, editor of the
OWL, is serving as head of the
yearbook critical service. He said
that ‘67 schools have entered the
competition.

Caldwell believes that the
Critical Service offered by his
group can be of value to the
contestants. He said “some of
the schools have used our ideas
in layouts this year that they
‘discovered at last year’s Insti-

tute. The fact that we received
more books this year than last
proves that our service is bene-
ficial.” '
Joan Thomas associate editor
of the PITT NEWS and news-
paper Critical Service head, re-
ports 120 entries. She said that
“the critical service is of great
value both to those entering pap-

recting them. Weprofit from cor-
recting their errors, and they in
turn, from our corrections.”
The major portion of Publi-
cations day will be devoted to
discussions on publishing. Edi-
tors from the PITT, NEWS, the
CWL, and the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER will chair the meet-
ings which will be devoted to
problems confronting the high
school journalist. ,
Professional advice on layout
and techniques of printing will be
available from representatives of
the OWL’s printing firm. The
business phase of publishing will
be discussed by members of the
student publications b u sin e s s
staffs.

On Job in Halls for Twenty Years

Heads Staff of 28
In Falk School,
Cathedral, Halls

By BERNICE M. COHEN

For the night owls at Pitt the
day always ends with a smile and
a cheery greeting from a man who
is just beginning his day’s work.

After 20 years on the “night

staff,” Bill Fowler considers Pitt
his second home. He leads a staff
of over 28 employees, headed by
Larry Riley and Mary Plivoris, in
the Cathedral, State, Thaw, and
Alumni Halls, and Falk School.

Reminiscing about his earliest

_ days as a janitor at Pitt, Fowler

recalled with a chuckle an ex-
perience that occurred while
cleaning a biology classroom.
“About 5 a.m. I turned on the
light in the room where live an-
imals are kept. Suddenly a roos-
ter began to crow loudly. He
must have thought that the sun
just came up! But I was a bit
scared,” he added.

Another time when he was
cleaning the same room a rabbit
got away. “I couldn’t catch it and
it kept getting in my way when
I swept,” he said.

‘Pretty Good Kids’

During the time Fowler has
been a member of the Pitt family
he can remember only “a few
devils,” because “most of the stu-

' “ill” Fowler

dents are pretty good kids,” he
said.
The watchman rarely has any

 trouble with Pitt students after

dark. “A few times fraternities
have sent boys as a prank, but

' _ they could never give me a good

enough excuse to let them in.”

“Of all the student groups,” he
stated, “the Pitt News staff stays
later than any other organization
because they work the hardest.”

Work ‘Day’.

Fowler’s work “day” begins at
10 p.m. and ends at 6:30 a.m. He
makes several checks on each floor
during the night. One person is al-

so stationed on each floor. \

“Once a lady and a man came
to the front door of Pitt at five
in the morning. They told me
they wanted to see the Com-
mons Room because they were
from Minnesota and were going
to leave Pittsburgh in a few
hours. I didn’t let them in.”
Then he wryly added, “I did
ﬁnd out that they only lived on
Craig St., though.” .

Bill told of the times during the
second world war when soldiers
were on guard duty every night
at Pitt. “For a long time they used
to make me halt when I walked i.n
and out the front door,” he said.

Small Flood

With -the minor exceptions of
cigarettes smoldering in ashtrays,
there has been only one time
when the night staff was worried

*about damage to the University.

“There was a heavy rain,” he said,
“and there was a small ﬂood in
the basement.” A sewer backed up
and the hallways and gym were
ﬂooded, but no signiﬁcant damage

In the Wiml

To say that politics is in the wind at Pitt would be

' ‘ comparable to standing in a blizzard and commenting about

the snow ﬂurries. Political parties and their organized

' slates, platforms, and campaigns have created an interest in

the forthcoming elections which has not been evident for
many years. By this date the slates and platforms have been
completed. Thecampaigns are -only beginning.

Political campaigns are a well established means of

I vote getting in all forms of elections but they offtimes take

tangential paths and defeat their own purpose. Such was
the case last year as‘ over—eager campaign managers and
their recruits began to barragethe students with their wares.
Chalk campaign slogans practically obliterated ODI{ and
I Panther walks. Posters, most poorly done,. made an illegal
appearance in the corridors of the University while the ex-

* terior suffered the impress of colored chalk.

_ Such efforts served poorly in their capacity as vote-
getters. They did serve to appropriately reﬂect the imma-

' turity and lack of common sense which every politician

disclaims.

For the most part the ramiﬁcations of elections are good,
beneﬁting those running for office as well as the voters and
the countless students who disdain the task of ballot casting.
But such attempts as were seen last year, though not physi-
cally harmful, are detrimental from a standpoint of Uni-
versity reputation. _

Such events as Engineers Week and the High School
Publications Institute have served highly in ‘the capacity
of public relations for Pitt. A well organized and executed
political campaign would enhance the ﬁne reputation which
has become synonymous with this University.

Money Should be Spent ... ’

WI s e y .
By Jim DeWeese

The cost involved in the operation of a univer-
sity the size of Pitt is, to say the least, consider-
able. Administrative committee in both the high-
er echelons and the students’ level invariably spend
a cofisiderable. portion of their time in an eternal
search for the "elusive dollar. But ways and means
of saving money are not easily, come by.

Now Men’s Council has come
up with a plan which, if put into
effect,-will have the University
approximately $1,160 per year,
a plan which has been sucked in-
to the vortex of red tape and
high level politics which spell
defeat for so many student proj-
-ects.

M.C.’s plan is so basic that it
raises a question as to why it
was not proposed before. It simply combines the
publication of the Compass, men’s handbook, and
the Vade Mecum, women’s handbook. Granted that
the use of the word simply is, in itself, an over-
simpliﬁcation, but the plan is good and can be put
into operation by a small matter of cooperation
and a large measure of open and fair mindedness
on the part of all concerned.

Serve Bath Men and Women

The combining of these two volumes would re-
sult in more than the considerable saving which
iniatially obscures other beneﬁts. Until this time
both books have been slanted toward their users.
Thus such activities as involve only women do not
appear in the Compass and those which’ exclude

 
     
       
 
   
 
   

women are, themselves, excluded from the pages
of the Vade Mecum. One book, listing all activi-
ties would undeniably serve, to a much more com-
plete degree, both men and women. Such a book
might almost be termed too complete.

So much for ethics. As a result of this project,
M.C. found that 157 pages were duplicated in the

"two publications. Only 43 pages in the Vade Mecum

differed from those contained in the Compass. And

the much defaced calendar section of the Compass

contained only 100 lines of small type which were
not printed in the women’s handbook.

Saving Undeniable

Last summer 3500 men’s handbooks and 1200
Vade Mecums were published at a total cost to
the University, of $3,463. Estimates indicate that

4700 combined handbooks can be had, for a total -

cost of $2,303., Thus the resultant saving of $1,160
to the University and the students. Theseiﬁgures
are based on the inclusion of an additional 30 pages
which would contain information now given only
in the Vade Mecum.

Personal Land Mines 1
There does not seem to be much standing in
the path of the proposal save the land mines called

personalities which have become rooted in the‘

University. M.C. sent l.etters to b-oth the dean of
men and the dean of women explaining their plan
in detail and outlining the expenditures involved.
The letter was posted on February 24th. An im-
mediate reply was requested due to the urgency
created by publisher’s deadlines. S

i The dean of men’s ofﬁce responded.

A Sports tMSa’r-ter,

,‘By Irv Rofhman
If Sports Editor Dave Mazer
permits me, I’m going to infringe

upon his impeccable ‘domain and ,

Sheltered be-
hind the news

times draw

that sports is

t h e greater
interest of the .

Mazer, how- ‘

C

few points up on me as we con-
tinue our contest to see on Wed-

nesdays and Fridays, which

'pages Pittites are reading——
sports or editorial. Fortunately,
we have Bibler.

Especial Trail-s

Though we\ know that the
imagination of the adult com-
munity has been captured as Dr.
Salk ﬁghts his historic battle to
wipe out Polio and millions of
dollars in buildings grow up on
campus, sports writing and the
spirit of individual competition
involving body contact remain
the especial traits about which

 
  
  

Americans want to read.

Now I’m a fellow who takes
his baseball lukewarm. Original
enthusiasm over the Pittsburgh
Pirates has rather disillusioned
me toward the sport.

I’ll get excited when the foot-
ball team scores and very quick-
ly bored if they’re far behind.
Swimming-—although I’ll never
swim as fast as some of the mer-
man who won.the Eastern Col-
legiate title this past week, I
wish there were a pool on cam-
pus where simple-bodied stu-
dents could fool around.

Nofhings Monsfered

This piece is not being written,
as Shakespeare’s Coriolanus said,
“to hear my nothings monster-
ed,” because from the pages of
the sports section some time ago
I learned about a pretty good
wrestling team which the athletic
department boasted. And since
my first match some two years
ago, enthusiasm is reserved

‘wholly for that mat sport.

Wrestling cannot be readily
explained to the uninitiated. It’s
competitors are quick and swift,
yet‘ slow and patient. The action
is rapid and the course of success
can all too quickly. turn into an
unexpected “pin.” Cautious
wrestlers are as striking Cobras,
should the opponent slack for a
second.

lt’s the tiger-like thrusts of

Joe Solomon and the radiating
conﬁdence of Ed Peery. It’s Ed
DeWitt’s piercing glance and
Swentosky’s ﬁght.‘It’s the casual
appearance of the ref in limited
quarters.

The shift of an arm position,
the twist of a leg, the attempt to
keep a rival off’ balance» are
seemingly small, yet will bring
a crowd" to its feet screaming for
a takedown.

Wrestling requires strength,
yet it is an individual effort. A
wrestler» strives to win for his
team, but his team can’tihelp
him once he’s' limited within the
blue square.

At Least One Reader

So everytime Mazer explodes
a mat story on either page six or
seven, he knows he has_ at least
one reader who is pulling for
another Eastern Championship

‘ team. Yes, headlines are well-

deserved and certainly enhance
the prestige of the university in
the eyes of many who ordinarily
readvall sections of a newspaper
and of those who ’couldn’t get
past the word “poliomyelitis” in
a John Troan medicalgcolumn.

If wrestlers cop the nationals,
here’s hoping Editor Jim De-
Weese schedules them onto page
one. Then I’ll be within my
rights to say “hurrah” instead of
sneaking it here ~ behind our
sports editor's back.

Mutuel Benefits Considered

By Paul Harrison

Although they haven’t come to

the surface as yet, we have,
among our society, a number of
“big money”~men who intend to
keep the Pennsylvania taxpayer
poor.

Poor to the estimated tune. of
20 m i l l i o 11
dollars. Dol-
lars which
could be spent
to i n c r e a se
teachers sal-
aries, b u il d
better schools,  -
modernize our »
criminal in- ;-
stitutions, give
us better high-
ways and to
expand chari-

table institutions to mention
just a few outlets. . _

At present this money is being

taken out of Pennsylvania and
being put into the hands of our
neighbor states.

These states, West Virginia,

New York, Ohio, New Jersey,

 

Maryland and Delaware, “are
using Pennsylvania money to
build their state institutions. I
admire these states, they seem to
know that taxpayers do have a
burden and they want to lessen
that load.

There is a referendum, called
S-92, before the Pennsylvania
state legislature which will give
our taxpayers a breather much
the same as our bordering states
have done. The bill is in the
hands of the legislature to de-
termine whether Pennsylvania
will have horse racing and pari-
mutuel betting.

For the past few weeks we
have been reading in our news-
papers the progress. of this bill.
Newly-elected Governor Leader
says he will not oppose such a
referendum but our legislators
have been hesitant.

Votes mean a great deal to

politicians. When those votes are
threatened politicians will slow
down, haggle and even pigeon-
hole a weighty problem. Last

week those votes were threat-*

ened and this" week the horse

 

racing bill bogged down.

Last week one of Pennsyl-
vania’s outspoken clergy blasted
the bill saying if passed the bill
would bring an increase in
crime to our state and lower our
morals. He branded the revenues
which horse racing would bring
to the state as “sin taxes”.

If this same member of the
clergy had ever gone to Wheel-
ing and seen the number of
Pennsylvania autos parked at
Wheeling Downs he would prob-
ably think our morals and crim-
inal tendencies have gone amuck.

Thus far only religious groups
have taken their licks at the bill
but it isn’t hard to believe people
who have interest in the sur-
rounding state racing syndicates
are throwing money to the oppo-
sition.

The referendum as is, will
have to be voted upon by the
voters of the state in November.
I-Iere is_ where the “big money”
boys are worried. If the Penn-
sylvania voters see a method of

' cutting their taxes there won’t be

a doubt of the dutcome.

YWCA to Cele]...

By TOBY GOLDBERG

March 18*    ~

   

To the historian or astronomer, a hundred years may
be but the length of a breath, but to an organization, a hun-
dred years is quite a long time. Pitt’s Young Women’s Chris-
tian Association will commemorate the national centennial
of the organization at a birthday dinner meeting on Wed-
nesday, Mar. 23 at 5:30 p.m. in 1217 C1.

The YWCA on Pitt’s campus is‘

however, only 44 years old and
was granted its charter in 1911.
It is headed by Mrs. A. C. Batz
who has been with University Y
since 1942, and was formerly a
faculty member of the sociology
department. In explanation ofithe
job of YWCA, Dr. Batz said, “The
YWCA, no matter where it is in
the world, keeps in mind the
principles on which it was found-
ed. The first of these is service,
carried out by our YWCA in
clothes drives for needy Koreans
and parties at Juvenile Court.

Second is the all-inclusiveness
of our program; anyone who
wishes to participate in our activ-
ities may join’, regardless of reli-
gious denomination.”

self the pleasure .of a better-

enthusiasm often inspired by
Luckies’ famous better taste is
illustrated in the Droodle (right)
titled: Alphabet soup for Lucky

. smoker. So why stew over what
cigarette to smoke? Luckies’
taste is letter-perfect. After all,
L.S. / M .F.T.--Lucky Strike means

is t_o_§itgc§ to taste better. “_I_t’_s
Toasted”—-the famous Lucky
Strike process—tones up Luckies’
light, mild, good-tasting tobacco

velop a personal faith. To ac-
complish this, the program divides
itself into three emphases: world
relatedness, effective citizenship,
and personal and campus aﬁairs.
In terms of world related-
ness, the YWCA holds a mock
United Nations meeting, as an
observance of U.N. Week. The
group travels annually to New
York City to visit the U.N. build-
ing.
To stress effective citizenship,
summer study-work projects are
sponsored throughout the U. ‘S.

Jean Benkert, Col. ’55, president

of the University YWCA, attend- ‘H

ed a work—seminar at Martha’s
Vineyard, Mass., last summer.

In line with personal and cam-
pus atfairs, the YWCA at the Uni-
versity sponsors an annual fresh-
man ceremony, Caritas, to stress
the importance of women in his-
tory. Inan attempt to build lead-
ership, weekend conferences are
held in cooperation with the
YMCA. Of late YWCA has,join-
ed with the YMCA, in a series of
discussions at homes of various
faculty members in an‘ attempt

to better student-faculty rela-
tions.
Th rough these projects, the

University’s YWCA carries out
the national organizations goal
of welfare and development of

As Riflers Fire in NBA

Captain Tom Shepard will be looking for a new inter-
collegiate record and the Panther riﬂe team will be gunning
for the top, spot when the Pittite shooters ﬁre in the NRA
intercollegiate tournament in Buffalo tomorrow.

Sgt‘. Joseph Gromko has high hopes for Shepard to sur-

pass the old tournament indi—°

vidual record of 295 in tomor-
1-ow’s .championship In a t c h e s
Gromko feels that Shepherd can
ﬁre a 296 in Buﬁalo.
Akron Strong

In a match last season, Shep-
herd fired» a 296 which is his best
performance to date. If Shep-

herd can equal this feat tomor- 3
row he will set a new record. Last ‘

season the dependable veteran
shooter placed second in the na-
tional tourney with ‘a 293.

L In last year’s tournament at

- Buffalo the Panther rifle s qu a d

placed second to Akron, which
once again is considered the

Pitties’ roughest opponent. Akron’

has already defeated the Panth-
ers in a dual match this season.
7Also in the tourney is Duquesne,
another team which beat the
riflernen in dual competition this
year.
Two Squads Enter

There will actually be two
teams of five men each compet-
ing in the tourney for the Pan-

, there. The first team led by top

man Shepherd will also include
James Cleary, Tom Klaric, Dave
Jacobson, and James Flynn.

The other squad‘ includes Bob

Phys Ed Program Rising

Miss Covert
Directs Plan

By. BENITA REINGOLD

Men’s sports may ﬂuctuate, but
as for the female physical educa-
tion department, there’s just one
direction—-up. _

Most of the credit due in this
female sports renaissance goes to
the Director of Women’s Physical
Education, Miss Margaret Covert,

When Miss Covert came to Pitt,

she saw that there were many‘

opportunities for an outstanding
program in the women's Physical
Education department. She started
working immediately and the
results are coming through now.

At present, Miss Covert is mak-
ing all the necessary changes to

put into process a new step which

will start next semester. This
change concerns the I choice of
Phys Ed as an elective. M

As it is now, girls receive no
credit for courses in Physical Edu-
cation beyond the ﬁrst year’s re-
quired course. In the new pro-
gram, women students may select
a course in Phys Ed as‘ an elective
and will receive the same credit
for it as in any other subject.

Some other future plans Miss
Covert foresees are a new build-
ing with all the modern facilities
and equipment that Pitt should
have. .

At present she feels that the
facilities of the university are‘ used
to the best possible advantage
Swimming and gymnastic ‘classes
are held at the YMHA, the Cathe-
dral Gym is used for rhythmic and

Hoop 'I—:>_1-irney
A First Here

the country. She did her under-
graduate work at the University
of West ‘Virginia and received her
Master’s degree at Pitt.

Sports is really Miss Covert’s
greatest pastime, but she ﬁnds
time for numerous activities be-
sides. She is advisor for the Fen-
cing Club, Women’s Recreational
Association, International Dance,
Orchesis, Women’s Self-Govern-
me‘nt Association, Pitt Players, and
the Junior class. She is also on the
executive board of the YMCA and

 

mittee. '

Miss Covert was a little reluc-
tant to state two more groups to
which she is an advisor, that of
the Pitt Cheerleaders and the Pitt
Twirlers. There "was much con-—
troversy over the establishment of
both groups, but she hopes the
Twirlers will have as good an out-
come as the cheerleaders have
had. ‘

All in all, it is easy to see the

tennis courts are used for the
elective course. Parts of the
Cathedral lawn are made into
hockey and softball ﬁelds.

Besides planning for the future
of the department, Miss Covert’s
main programming is concerned
with the present situation. She is
quite proud of the way the sports
program has been running.‘

For the ﬁrst time this year,, an
intramural basketball tournament
was held---the ﬁrst tournament of
this kind to be held at Pitt. There
are plans being made for tourna-
ments in volleyball, ﬁeld hockey,
softball, and other team sports.

Before she came to Pitt in 1947,
Miss Covert had taught in various
high schools in different parts of

tional experience.”

Wrestlers Won Despite

The anti-Pitt feelings were running high at Penn State
last Friday and Saturday when Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers

» took to, the mats in an effort to win the 51st Eastern Colle-

giate Wrestling Association tourney. V
And for those’ unable to attend, it can hardly be ex-

plained in words how close the Jungle Cats came to being
dethroned byreferees, timers, and officials. In addition, 75

e per cent of the fans were against the locals and they weren’t

afraid to let anyone know, either.

Not to make excuses or alibis¢

-—the Peerymen don’t need any
because they have won the crown
both years in which they have
competed invthe mat classic--but
here are a few of the incidents

‘that irked the Panthers no end-

The first verdict that went
against the Jungle Cats occur-
red in the opening round of
the tourney and might very
well been the telling blow that
could have caused the down-
fall of the Blue and Gold be-
fore they evengot adjusted to
what was really happening.

Bob Cook, seeded second in
the 147-pound class, met Roger
Judd of Cornell who possessed
a less than mediocre slate of
4-7-1.

After two periods of uninterest-
ing wrestling, the bout was dead-‘
locked and Cook knew that he
would have to start moving if he
expected to win. Judd was on the
defense the entire third period as
Cook repeatedly chased him off
the mat with Judd only smiling.
Finally the bout went into over-
time with both boys riding each
other out E‘; the extra sessions.

When it came time for the de-
cision-—you guessed it———Judd was
declared the winner and the lo-
cals’ chances began to grow dim-
mer as an outraged Cook had just

been put out of the tourney.

As time went on, the deci-
sions involving the Peerymen
began to get more and more
ridiculous.

Another incident occurred in
the consolation round which
found Don Huff tangling I with
Lawrence Marr of Navy. At the
end of regulation time the score

‘was knotted at 5-5.

The referee walked over to the
timer’s stand to see if anyone
had the one-minute time advan-
tage needed to decide the bout.
The Panther crew knew that it
had to go into overtime because
frosh coach Dick Brenneman had
the stop-watches \ out and Marr
was some 25 seconds short of the
time needed. .

Much to the dismay of Pan-

ther rooters and to the likings
of the majority, the ref walked
out on the mat and raised M.arr’s
arm as the victor. This sent the
official brigade of Panthers in a
full charge for the timer’s table

to check the riding time ‘advan-
tage. .

When they got to the table the
time clocks were back on zero
and it had been recorded in the
books. Thus Huff -lost a bout
which was very important and
should have gone into overtime.

Probably the biggest blunder
of the night though, came when
the official scores were total-
ed. The big board showed that
Pitt and Penn State each had
50 points, and most of the’ fans
were waiting for the official
announcement.

After a delay of 20 minutes,
the resentful crowd began. to yell
and clap for the decision. The
majority of them had ‘accepted
the fact that the 51st tourney had
ended in a tie. That is, all but

Athletic Grades  
On Up-and-Up

By DAVE MAZEB
Sports Editor

 

 

Just about this time every year Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton sends a letter‘to faculty members and lettermen
concerning the scholastic averages of Pitt athletes.

Happily to report, the Director was very pleased with
his most recent message because contrary to public opinion,
Panther athletes are “making grades” and making good ones.

This past semester, the fall term, 50 ballplayers came
through with better than 2.00 Quality Point Averages. This
is the longest honor roll the Panthers have attained since
Captain Tom Hamilton started the annual report a few years
back.

Two teams, the baseball and swimming, have really
high total Q.P.A.’s. The baseballers beam knowledge at
a 1.78 clip while the natators average 1.7 . Not bad for
athletes. - ’

The other squads all hover around the
1.4 mark and in comparison with the all men’s
average of 1.49 of last year, this looks pretty
good.

There are some dark spots on the pic-
ture too, as Hamilton points out. Two mem-
bers of the freshman football squad, two var-
sity swimmers, and one track man were lost
because of grades but two of these are still . ,  .
in school, although not eligible. If their Hamilton
grades improve, they will be reinstated next semester.

Even these dark spots have some light, though. A couple
seasons back, almost half a football team ﬂunked out every
year and in other sports, losses were almost the same.

Now, Pitt coaches are instructed to only take in
high school athletes who have shown that they are cap-
able of maintaining a college standard. The results are
-evident. Five men are ineligible out of 247 men.

“It’s a different type of boy that makes up the Panther
teams these days,” says Hamilton, and on this part, no one
can disagree.

The hope for success in athletics, therefore, now lies with
the men who,are primed to go ‘to college four years and
this, if anything, should be a relief to the coaches and the
fans.

Students

The University of Pitts-
burgh is batting .333 at the
oﬁice of Elwin G. Smith &
Company, industrial contract-
ing ﬁrm in Emsworth, Pa.
From a total of 33 employees
at the Pittsburgh office of the
company, eleven are either en-
rolled in the various schools of
the,University or have graduated
from them.

Herbert Bauchmire, Thomas
Hartman and R. Donald Wid-
dowson of the Sales Division,
-and Leo Chraska of the Engi-
neering Section are taking
courses at the Evening School
to obtain degrees in the School
of Engineering.

Dorothy Bell, sales, June Hoff-

accountant, are working for de-
grees in the School of Business
Administration.

June Morrison, cost account-
ant, who graduated from the
College last year through Eve-
ning School credits, is now tak-
ing graduate work in English.

Robert Ulrich, purchasing, is en-
rolled in the special Purchasing
course offered by the School of

trict Sales representative, gradu-
ated from the School of Engi-
neering in 1949.

Giving and Receiving

A month from now the hue, cry, and dust of another po-
litical campaign will have settled and the E.S.A. will have
elected new officers. These leaders will be new in the sense
of being elected new officers. These leaders will be new in
the sense of being elected to new offices, but upon closer
scrutiny we will see the same familiar faces.

This condition is reminiscent of the situation in France
where a man who sticks around long enough may become
premier again and again. Even if he is deposed as Premier,
he can be seen holding ofﬁce in some other capacity.

This is not ‘a condemnation of either group, the E.S.A. or
French cabinet, rather, they should be thanked for perform-
ing a thankless job, but an -indictment of an electorate who
will shirk its duties and are willing to allow an overworked
handful to shoulder the responsibility for the many.

Yet, these are the same many who will complain inces-
santly if things aren’t run according to their ideas of how
things should be run. They are also the same peoplelwho
yell “clique” everytime an award is made, an honor bestowed,
or an appointment made. ‘ .

From Apr. 18 through Apr. 21, the Evening Student As-
sociation will hold its annual elections. There will be ample
time for all who are interested, and we should all be inter-
ested, to vote.

An ad was placed in the last edition of the Evening News
calling for members to act as chairmen for social functions.
The Evening News is repeating this ad in this edition be-
cause the response was far from overwhelming. With this
bit of complacency, it is little wonder that so few have taken
so much upon themselves.

' To paraphrase an overworked platitude:

A person receives only as much as he gives. Only after
we have taken every expedient to correct an undesirable
condition, do We have any right to complain that something
is not being done right. 1

Beginning with the ad and continuing with the election,
let us take steps to set our house in order.
