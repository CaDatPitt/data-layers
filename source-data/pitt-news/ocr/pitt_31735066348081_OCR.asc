Porters Lead Dwindles In BAS Spreads Annex Petitions
Wake of New Voting  

BY PETE BUTCH

The. Black Studies Department
faculty decided to redistribute their
votes in favor of a new chairman
after one of the top contenders, Dr.
Constance Achononu of Washing-
ton State University withdrew her
bid for chairmanship of the depart-
ment to accept‘ a position at
Shoreline College in Washington
State.

According to Black Studies faculty
member Emmanual Anise, the top
contenders had been Black studies
faculty member Curtiss Porter, the
interim head of Carlow College’s
anthropology department, Mervin
Williams, CMU faculty member
Rollo Smith and Achononu.

The standings before Achononu’s
withdrawal had given Porter a
25-21 lead over the second candi-
date Achononu.

“But most of Achononu’s sup~.

porters recast their votes for Rollo
Smith, said Black Studies faculty
member James Karioki. ‘ The
voting was Smith 28, Porter 16,
with each person having four. votes
and three persons absent.

“In the past those’ three have
voted for Porter and I assume they
will when they get a chance to vote.
This will create a tie and leave the

University senate’

matter entirely upto the adminis-
tr_ation and the search committee.”

“Provost Rhoten Smith and
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg called a Black
Studies faculty meeting Wednes-
day to announce Achononu’s with-
drawal,” explained Karioki.-”
They asked the faculty. if they
wanted a chance to revote.

After the motion was passed
Smith advised the faculty to keep
the following qualiﬁcations in mind
while voting: The chairman must
be a person who will reduce
internal strifeand factions; clarify
the mission of the department;
function well with the dean; inte-V
grate the department into the
community; and respect and be
respected by his colleagues,
according to Karioki.

“I think these qualiﬁcations are \

fair,” said Karioki, “A meeting
like this would be held with any

‘department having the problems .

we are. The only objection among
faculty members was that the

' mission of the department had

already been decided and that the
integration within the community
was a two way street.”

Rosenberg explained:

The use of the Annex has been

the Pitt Professional Union Council

byRothman, Gordan,‘ Foreman,

and Groudine Law Ofﬁces, which

concluded that ‘jthe proposed

‘agreement’ may constitute an\
under

Article 4' of the Public Employee

The agreement in question, part
of the Faculty Activity Plans, would
require teachers in the School "of

speciﬁcally‘ deﬁning their goals
each school year. They would then

be subject topenalization if they .

did not fulﬁll these goals.

Jonathan Harris, Chairman of the
Tenure Committee of the Pitt
Professional Union, submitted the
Senate resolution to investigate
this practice, stating that the plan
is a “fundamental violation of
academic freedom.”

Speaking in agreement with
Harris was Senate member Profes-
sor Richard Cottam, who attacked
the School of Education policy as an .
attemptto stifle creativity in this

“Such a policy would reward the

this isn't the direction the
University is going in general.”

Greek Week Programs
Stir SGB Disagreement”

BY BILL MOORE

Disagreements over the amount
of funding to be allocated Greek
Week organizers at Wednesday's
Student Government Board (SGB)
meeting ended with the Greek
Week budget being returned to the
Allocations committee for “further
investigation" and consideration.”

The major disagreement centered
around Greek Week’s request for
$450 to cover the cost of programs
for Greek Sing. ‘ Interfraternity
Council [IC] representative Phil
Rosenthal argued that IC needed
$450 to fund programs. equal in
quality to previous years.

$100 for this purpose.

“I don't know where Allocations

“They must pull these ﬁgures out

absurd.” '

Allocations chairman Bill Barker
said, “Last year’s programs we;-..

Cancer Treatments Discussed

cancer patients have radical mas-
tectomies.

Fisher said the results came from
a two-year nationwide study
involving 1700 women.

In a second study, the results
showed that a combined approach
of surgery and chemotherapy offers
the best chances of survival in
women whose cancer has spread to
the lymph nodes.
“Chemotherapy can really do
something in the prolonging of a
cancer-free state in these pa-
tients,” Fisher said.

In response to charges that
patients were not completely
informed about the study, Fisher
said that the procedures used in his
studies were fully explained to the
patients and consent forms were
signed before treatment was
administered.

“If a particular form of treatment
was judged better for the patient,
she was taken out of the program
and treated,” Fisher said. “This
was done many times.”

Dr. Ronald LaMont-Havers, Dep-
uty Director of the National
Institutes of Health, said,“NIH has
been deeply concerned with the
ethical question of treatment of
human subjects in clinical studies.

Scandal Impeacties Student  

(Contizzuedjronz Page I)

Like another, better known im-
peachment effort, debate at Penn
State has involved clandestine tape
recordings, judicial rulings, and
ignored subpoenaes. L

The 15-11 USC senate vote this
week stemmed from charges that
Cernusca, 21, a biological health
major from Shenandoah, broke a
contract for the student health
insurance plan with one company
and gave it to another.

The 35 member senate and 40 seat
academic assembly must cast bal-
lots on Cernusca’s fate within three
weeks. A two thirds vote is needed
‘to remove ‘him from office.
Cernusca’s problems with the
senate started soon after his elec-
tion last spring by a narrow 12 vote
margin over Frank Muraca, 21, of
Dunmore. More than 6,500 votes
were cast in a three way race.

The impeachment effort has been
led to a large degree by supporters
of the two defeated candidates.
Cemusca claimed the first insur-
ance ﬁrm misrepresented the doc-
uments he signed and attempted to
bribe him. But later a Center
County Court ruling found the
contract binding.

The article of impeachment voted
at a heated USG senate meeting
late Wednesay called for impeach-

articles of impeachment was tabled
until a special senate meeting Sun-
day. 4

Cernusca was ruled in contempt
by a special investigating Commit?
tee for not producing the tape when
ordered to last month.

He said he didn’t turn the tapes
over because the tape belongs to
Richardson, who wanted time to
seek legal counsel before surren-
dering the tape.

Richardson handed over the tape
the following day, but Joanne
McCarthy, a member of the com-
mittee, said the tape “was in
Cernusca’s apartment and it would
have only taken ten minutes for
him to get it and bring it to us.”

Faculty Union Hearings Recess UniversitySencIte Calls

(Continued from Page 1)

Powers did admit, however, that
there was a trend to consolidate
physically, the various areas of the
health professions, into one qua-
drant on the University’s campus.

Whether department chairmen
can be classified as faculty or
administrators, and the status of
research associates, -- whether
they have a community of interest

’ with faculty, were also discussed.

The PLRB hearings which began
September 23, are scheduled to
resume for four dates in November,
two more in December, and then
two weeks in the new year to
conclude January 17.

The Pitt Professional Union [PPU]
kicked off the hearing phase of
unionization in June by petitioning
the state for an election among the
faculty to choose a bargaining
agent.

The hearings are designed to
collect evidence on the nature of
Pitt so the PLRB can make a
determination on the proper
composition for a collective bar-
gaining unit--a group of workers
with a community of interest.

Three faculty groups are bidding

for support of the general Pitt.

the Faculty Association of the
Graduate School of Public Health--
have intervened in the hearing
process contending their respective
groups should be excluded from a
general faculty unit, because their
special interests would not be

easily satisfied. Before the hear- '

ingsl began however, the PLFA
petitioned the Board separately,
calling .for an election of the law
school faculty to name a bargaining
agent. A

William Hannon, director of

Employee Relations, said yester-

day that from the administration’s
point of view, the hearings are
going along fine.

“Essentially, it is this way
because we’ve been calling the
shots,” he said, explaining that
unlike the administration, the other
parties have not yet been allowed
to call witnesses. “But I think
we’ve proven, through, the testi-
mony of Jack Freeman (Vice

Chancellor for Planning and
Budget) that there is one budget
for this Univeristy, and through the
testimony of Joe Dutton (Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance) that there is one physical
plant at this university.

“And for what little we’ve gotten
into [at the hearings] the academic
side of the University, I think we’ve
proven that this is one university
academically too.”

Hannon said the administration’s
position that the law, medical, and
public health faculty should be
included in one overall unit, while
those faculties want to be excluded,
is strong.

“Many faculties in this university
differ from other faculties, even in
terms of exterior accreditation
standards,” Hannon said. “The
business, engineering, and educa-
tion schools all have this restric-
tion. Should they all be in separate
units too?” «

Another war

A Solution to the Economy

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Inﬂation has gripped our nation,
the price of food and fun has risen
to astronomical ﬁgures and to find
the solution Our President Gerald
Ford is rummaging around in his
soul again.

Discussed at great length by

economic pundits and advisors.

alike is guaranteed to put this
nation back on its feet again. It is
simply stated in_one word: war.
What better answer to our nation-
al problems? There is plenty of
precedent for it. Americans have

- been at war continously since this

country began its glorious crusade
to make everyone everywhere an

— American.

America has always been at its
best when ﬁghting a war. The roar
of shot and shell is part and parcel
of our tradition. If not in Thailand,
then in the streets of Detroit.

Look at all the great quotes we've
gotten from wars: “Don't shoot ’til
you see the whites of their eyes,”
from the War of 1812. “Damn the
torpedoes, full speed ahead,” from
the Spanish American War.
“Loose lips sink ships,” from the
First World War. “Women and
children first,"
recent My Lai Massacre.

For that matter Mr. Doubting
Thomas, “the rockets red glare” is
right smack in the middle of our
national anthem.

of world peace, thousands upon

campus Police report

Ghoking in

BY ED HOLLIN

V The destruction of a 135-page

report on the workings of the
campus police, despite administra-
tion claims of the necessity of
confidentiality in certain matters,
still seems an unwarranted move
which can only lead to the belief
there is something to hide.

Three main reasons are given for
its destruction. First, Assistant
Vice Chancellor of Business and
Finance Myron Skrabut claims
“choking in paperwork" is simply
not the style of his office. One is
forced to wonder just how much
room a report of 135 pages takes
up. A

More importantly, it-is claimed
the report is so damning to the
police officers, not their super-
visors or people in the Vice
Chancellor's office, that its release
would serve no purpose at all. "It
would only further fuel the fires in
what former chief Bob Fadzen, who

. was a member of the commission

which drew up the report, called a
“political war” between the
officers and the University, they
claim.

It also asserted that releasing the
report may damage attempts to.
correct the problems it details since
they would very soon "go under-
ground.” ‘ -

Yet, wouldn't a release of the
report clear the air, and document
the issues which the University and
the police have been “warring"
over? And what speciﬁc wrong-
goings need to be~co_rrected before
they disappear lil-:e-.gop_hers? ' And

ttvh

from the more .

 iustftfv -W

    

thousands of Americans are with-
out work, from ship welders and
chemical warfare researchers to
generals and members of the SDS.

A snivelling enemy would unite
our nation, creating a common
cause among the factions which are
tearing the heart strings of our
culture. A war would bolster the
GNP and put bread and butter on
the tables of masses of welfare
recipients.

Naturally, a conflict with Russia or
Red China would not do the trick. A
nuclear holocaust is far too eﬂi-
cient. After all, the whole thing
would be over in a few hours.

Thereare, however, no lack of

belligerants. Aren't you fed up
with the strangle-hold the Arab
oil-sheiks have on our nation’s
ﬂeets of Cadillacs? What of the
plight of the three Aermicans who

‘ were refused a Coke in a Brazilian

pharmacy? How can we stop the
ﬂood of pornography from the
decadent Scandinavians? And the
British! What are they up to in that
big tower in London? Nothing
good, I'll warrant you.

There is no lack of manpower or
bloodthirstiness in our mighty pop-
ulace. The stalwart Pentagon and
our crack military forces stand
ready to . scuffle with anyone‘,
animal, vegetable or mineral, that
spurns the Red, White and Blue.

It is simply a matter of good-old
American guts squirming in the
reverse peristalsis of carnage, de-

result?

There are inconsistencies in the
versions of the report offered by
different people who have read it..
There were only a handful of these
fortunate enough to see what must
be one of the University’s most
highly classiﬁed documents, and
the Chancellor was not among
tliem.

One official said the report out-

lined specific activities, some of

them criminal, and cit-ed indi-
viduals, and releasing it would ruin
any chances of prosecution, not
that the University was blood-
thirsty, ‘but he certainly didn’t
think these people deserved the‘
right to take advantage of the
opportunity of serving the Univer-
sity.

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham, who read the study, said
he “could not think of an individual
instance where I would want to
press charges.”

A third person said one of themost
blatant offenses was taken care of
when the two officers involved left
the force for reasons other than the
wrongdoings uncovered in the
report.

There are rumors ﬂying on both
sides speculating what the docu-
ment contained that the University,
for reasons of its own, wants left
hidden. A policywof openness is the’
surest way to avoid the potentially
explosive spread of rumors. I see
no reason why an official is not
afraid to release what he claims to

-be the whole story as he remem-
. be_rs_i_it;_to a reporter, ‘yet, tries to

If it is not Cyprus, then let it be

rolling to secure our national
economy, our homes, our pay-
checks.

One step in the right direction and
we can cast aside the blight of
peace, the poverty of tranquility
and quash the nefarious schemes of
our enemies whoever they are and
whatever those plans might be.

President Ford took that step
"when he_announced Americans will

of Chile and anybody else we want
to, when we feel like it and how we
feel like it. We merely have to wait
for one of those self-effacing e-
merging nations to pipe up «and
begin a new and brighter chapter in
the economic history of our coun-
try.

Whining peaceniks will attempt to
delay the inevitable and necessary
battle between us and them [or
whoever). It is time they woke up,
stood back and let our President

get on with the work of starting

another war.

And when we begin gearing up
production of tanks, guns and
instruments of death and ruin, we
can ‘relax, in the knowledge Amer-
icaiis back on the path of savage
normalacy.

Good luck, Mr. President, and
good luck members of the Central
Intelligence Agency wherever you
may be. '

Paperwork  

concerned with learning the truth.

The parallels between this case
and cases of excessive secrecy in
Washington during the past six
years are striking. Not that I am
predicting the resignation of a
Chancellor and his aides over what
may be only an error in judgment,
an overreaction by the Office of
Business and Finance.

But this is a case where public
information was stopped by a chief
executive’s assistants, supposedly
while that executive knew nothing
about it. Executive Assistant to the
Chancellor Ray C_oble said the first
he knew ‘of the shredding of the
report was froma reporter’s phone
call requesting confirmation.

A university is not a government,
but neither is it a private corpora-
tion without a responsibility to
make-public its activities.

Vice Chancellor Joseph Dutton
and his staff, and Bob Fadzen and
his, are to be commended for
initiating a study, whose purpose
was of a high order. Some of the
recommendations released in the

three page summary of the report .

are worthwhile, and contrary to the
beliefs of some of the officers, not
in violation of their contract.

Yet, a benevolent purpose has
taken on an image of secret
reports, classiﬁcation stamps and
paper shredders. hopefully through
an error in judgment, and not by
any attempt to cover up wrong-

doings. which might at first be" —

‘Karma Drug Halfway House  

BY WAYNE CARUTHERS

People with drug problems in
Oakland have some place to go.
That place is Karma House.

Located in a comfortable old home
at 262 South Bouquet Street,
Karma House is a non-residential
counseling center for individuals
involved with drugs.

Founded in 1970 as part of The
Whale’s Tale Inc.,‘ a non-profit
community service organization,
Karma House provides such ser-
vices as crisis intervention, short
term and ongoing counseling,
and community
education, provided free to people
seeking help. Funding is provided
through the Allegheny County
Mental Health and Mental Retard-
ation Program.

Although Karma House offers it
serves to people of any age, the
atmosphere probably appeals more
to the younger clientele.

Director Dave Dropea, a graduate
of the Pitt School of Social Work
said, “We have pretty straight
middle class people coming here,
kids that think of themselvessas
un-straight, wehave ‘students and
non-students...people who just
have normal everyday hassles with
their wife, mpther or roommate.
Some of our clients are Pitt
students but we don’t have‘ an
awful lot of them, partially because
you have the Counseling Center
and for a while,‘ A Little Help from
Your Friends was seeing allot of
people...”

Dropea emphasized that all clients
are kept in the strictest conﬁdence.

assured of confidentiality. We
never talk to anyone else about
them unless we have their permis-
sion.” He also pointed out that
parents of a client would not be
notiﬁed unless the client wished it.

Karma House receives an average
of 10 to 20 new clients each month.
Length of treatment for these cases
varies from one night for a crisis
counseling case, .to approximately
one year or more.

The staff of Karma House num-
bers 16 including the director, two
associate directors, nine counsel-
ors, a‘ consulting psychiatrist, and
other administrative personnel.

Formerly open around the clock,
counselors are now on duty from
8:30 am to 12 pm. Dropea cited a
drop in the nighttime cirsis cases as
the reason for the shorter hours.

Two counselors are on duty during
open hours and available for im-
mediate counsultation. .

In the case of extreme emotional
or physical problems, clients will
be referred to another institution;
Says Dropea, “If a'person clearly
needed hospitalization or detoxifi-
cation for. example-, if they were
xeally strung out on downs, if they
were really addicted, withdrawal
anywhere but a hospital could be
life-threatening. So, we would
always make a referral to a
hospital. If a person is psychotic
and really needs a psychiatrist who
can prescribe medication, we will
refer ‘them to a mental health
center.”

— ‘He also noted that a person in

need of much work is an intensive
living situation will be referred to a
residential treatment program.

Karma House also engages in
training of individuals -working with
people at the request of local
colleges and universities. Students
have been accepted for training
from various programs including
counseling, social work, psycho-
logy, and psychiatric nursing.

This generally involves intensive
study and observation from two to
four days weekly.

The’ Whale’s Tale also operates
other houses for people with pro-
blems of a different nature.

attention for the first time, the

 distorted the report because bras,_
O ‘girdles and hair curlers were
igmerely put in garbage cans.

“ At the recent Eastern Regional
-7:Conference of NOW, in Atlantic
:City, Kennedy said, ‘‘I think we
;should talk about burning jock
straps -and let the media decide ,
 whether we burned them with the
gmen in them!” Accordingly, there
"is some‘ hostility among NOW
j'_members' against the media be-
 cause of what they claim has been
- an attitude ranging from ridicule to
“benign neglect.

from police, lawyers, doctors and

of the offender was difficult.
NOW’s anti-rape clinics in major
cities provide a place where a
woman can go for guidance and
assistance without the harassment
and are pressuring state legisla-
tures to make rape charges easier
to convict. Changes have been
forced in several states.

Want-ads that previously read

The National Women’s Political
Causus focusing on women in
politics, was a spin-off from NOW.
Its members emphasize the need
for women not only to campaign for
male candidates, but to run for
political office themselves-

Women in sports is a main issue
with NOW and is the main thrust of
the Pennsylvania chapters. .NOW
member Karen Marsden summed
up the issue: “The competitive
spirit coupled with the ability to
cooperate under team situations, as
well as the concept of fair play,
engendered by sports are highly
desirable for the citizenry of any
nation, women and men, girls and

local chapter president Nancy Kirk
Gormley.

Pennsylvania members have also
been using legal action against
husbands who have abandoned
their wives and children without
any other means of support, forcing
several men into county jails in the
past weeks and requiring them to
make support payments.

At the recent conference between
leaders of women’s organizations
and President Gerald Ford, NOW
President Karen DeCrow urged
him to meet with state legislatures
to ‘help pass the Equal Rights
Ammendment (ERA) in the few
remaining hold out states. Al-
though NOW sees an_ improved job
market for women over the situa-
tion 10 years ago they cite unequal
salaries and promotion-ability as
number one criterion for American
women. The ERA would also
concentrate on national law credit
and home-ownership rights for
women, as currently difficult for a
single woman to obtain.

Instead of burning their bras,
members of NOW have been
quietly doing some positive things

Takes Patent

On New-style Eyeglasses

BY RON NYSWANER

While Benjamin Franklin is usual-
ly credited with the invention of
bifocals, it is Elizabeth J. Stoner, a
night student at Pitt, who takes
credit for turning them upside-
down.

Stoner is the owner of patent
number 3,773,407 from the United
State patent office in Washington
DC. Her invention: inverted
eyeglasses.

These glasses differ from ordinary
ones in that the stems connect to

the bottom of the frames and the

nosepiece is inverted. According to
Stoner this allows the nearsighted
wearer to look at distant objects
and then to closer ones without
removing the eyepieces ‘or lifting
them ‘up. To view close objects one
need only look down and the
glasses, structured as they are, will
not get in the way.

Meeting Stoner.was a novelty
indeed. She is a fascination, a
friendly woman who revels in
tackling a tough challenge.

“My invention grew from neces-
sity," she told me over coffee at
Winky’s Thursday night. Two
years ago she had an accident
which confined her to bed. Being

nearsighted, she needed her g1ass- -

es to watch television. But to read,

she had to remove the glasses. She

found that when the glasses were
turned upside-down, they did not
block her view when looking down.
“So I started wearing them that
way," she said.

She contacted several optical sup-
ply houses trying to convince some

innovative optician to make her a.

pair of inverted eyeglasses. Final-
Iy, a daring young man from Sears
optical department accepted ‘the
challenge. A

Stoner proudly wore her innova-
tion without thinking of the possi-
bility of mass—production until her
lawyer suggested the idea. The
proper documents were sent to
Washington, and in November
1973 she received her patent and is
now searching for a market with
the help of a patent broker. Several
offers’ have been made, including
one from Foster-Grant for sun-
glasses of the inverted style.

Stoner graduated from North Hills.
Passavant'Hospital as a registered
nurse, and has been a full time"
night student at Pitt for two years,
going year-around. She is a double
psychology and sociology major
and hopes to graduate next Au-
gust.

Stoner is not selfishly ambitious,
she just enjoys, developing a good

idea and carrying it through. She
is innovative, creative, and some-
what daring.

And she isn’t done with inventing
either. She didn’t discuss all of her
plans-but I could see it in her
eyes: Today eyeglasses, tomorrow
the world.

Porter disagreed. ‘‘I think it was

major tool for channeling opinion
for the Black Studies Department is
the Search Committee as appointed
by the dean and which for these
purposes he has apparently chosen
to bypass in the interest of general
confusion.”

struck out.

There remained only one survivor
who excaped untamished from this
fiasco. Legrand’s music, although
not diverse enough in style to make
“an evening” of it, highlighted the
program. Some of those popular
tunes included “Summer of 42,”
“Brian’s Song” and “Windmills of
Your Mind.”

What remains a baffling question
to my mind is how an evening with
such quality material can run
amuk so badly. The fault rests on

the shoulders of both director and-

performers.

A basic prerequisite for any good .

muscial performer should be his
ability to sing, and that doesn’t
only _mean an ability to carry a
tune. Every performer but one
lacked a dynamic vibrancy in tone
quality, an excitement to captivate
its viewers. Performer Joyce
Levenson must receive recognition
for her sincere and convincing
efforts, far surpassing the others in

structed of smiles and tears
wrapped in plastic.

The review seemed contrived, and

much of the. responsibility goes to
director Dan Kamin. His conven-

through several ‘sentimental songs

have tried a “boy loses boy”
approach: anything innovative
might have shown some insight.
However, the cutsy “bits” only
managed to cheaply upstage the
songs themselves. Better the

“Thing” Treats Gays

” where he meets Jason (Bo White).

BY A. McCOY

Film-maker Christopher Larkin
has brought the subject of homo-
sexuality up from the sordid level
on which it usually has been
treated, and has portrayed it
simply as a relationship between
two people. His new film, A Very
Natural Thing,_ is an honest and
perceptive study of gay relation-
ships.

David (Joel Robert) is an ex-monk
who has come out. He meets Mark
(Curt Gareth) at a club, and it’s the
proverbial love-at-first-sight. They
embark on an intense and ulti-
mately damaging relationship.
David is a romantic—he wants a
declaration of love from Mark, who
in turn wants no‘ emotional com-
mitments. They start having spats
which grow into serious arguments
and eventually drive them apart.

David is depressed for awhile, but
then he goes to a "gay pride rally

the mediocraty to capture a mo-
ment of intensity. Such held true
for Levenson’s enthuiastically re-
ceived rendition of “Pieces of
Dreams.” Kamin must be com-
mended for giving Levenson the
widest variety and selection of
material.

For those interested in a good‘
meal with mild entertainment, the _

dinner-theatre willsufﬁce. But for
an avid theatre lover, sustitutes
simply fall short.

They start a relationship, but this
time it's Jason who wants love and
commitment—David has become
the cynic. They agree on a casual
and open relationship as the ﬁlm
ends, and presumably live happily
ever after, either together or apart.

If this plot dealt with a male/fe-

vmale relationship, it would be

horrendous. It’s just barely saved
by its novelty and tongue-in-cheek
humor. 9

The three main actors are natural
and honest in their characteriza-
tions, steering carefully away from
any‘ unfortunate stereotypic be-
havior. They come across as
human beings with many other
sides to their characters, rather
that one-dimensional
case studies.

The dialogue is always verging on
the banal, sounding as if Erich
Segal wrote most of it. In fact, the
film is a self-conscious‘parody of

“Tonight we have the unique_

experience of welcoming a very

unique international poet to the city

of Pittsburgh,” Director Samuel
’ Hazo introduced Mexican peot
Octavio Paz for the ﬁrst reading of
the 1974-75 season'of the Interna-

Lecture Hall. Truly it was a unique
experience. _
_ The reading was divided into four

‘Love Story, which the lovers fro-
licking amid the wonders of nature.
The only part of the ﬁlm that

really falls flat are the documentary p

sequences in which various mem-
bers of the Gay Lib movement
articulate their thoughts. The
rambling rhetoric used is a hold-
over from the 60’s and creates a
preachiness which isn’t in keeping
with the rest of the film. ‘It’s hard
to see why a film that is moving so
nicely on a emotional current
should do an about-face andistart
trying to make social/ political com-

trying to make Natural Thing to be
the gay movement what Strawberry
Statement was to the anti-war
movement (which wasn’t much
anyhow). ,

. As an emotional study, the ﬁlm is
successful. The feelings. of the
characters for one another are
portrayed in depth, so the result is
not at all pornographic. If any-

unreal. But then it’s still a movie. ‘

Sports Editor

Old friends can be enemies. Just
ask Pitt’s Johnny Majors and North
Carolina's Bill Dooley.

As assistant coaches at Mississ-
ippi State several years ago,
Majors and Dooley were best
friends and next door neighbors
but even then adversaries on the
field. On Thursday nights after the
regular practice, Majors’ “B”
squad would face Dooley’s fresh-
man team in the weekly “Toilet
Bowl.” But tomorrow at_ 1:30 at
Keenan Field in Chapel Hill, NC,
neither will _be giving “extra
downs” to try and tie the score, as
they often did on Thursday
evenings.

Booters Shutout CMU

BY JIM SPANOS

/\._. Tom Murphy's shot from 23

4- 

yards out with nine minutes left in
the game gave the Pitt soccer team

-‘ their second win of the season, 2-0

over Carnegie-Mellon Wednesday
night. Murphy’s goal, too high for
CMU goalie Mark Canepa to
handle, broke the scoreless tie in a
game in which the Cats played
superior soccer in every facet of the
game.

‘The second panther goal, which
’ iced the 2-0 Panther win, came with

just 1:10 left in the contest. Billy
Rex, who didn’t start the game
because of a leg injury, skidded the
ball past Canepa from 10 yards
away. He was assisted on the play
by John Wallace, who had kicked
the ball over the heads of two
Tartan defenders.

The Panthers could easily have
had six goals, primarily due to the
fancy footwork of John Curley.
Curley had several excellent
opportunities in the first half, but

~ couldn’t score. '

‘‘I should have a few goals, but

"f they just didn’t go in,” Curley said,

PIT'I“S ENGLISHMAN JOHN .CURLEY* at :5-6 is sometimes dwarfe

not making excuses.

Curley’s play, however, did put
repeated pressure on the CMU
goalie, as did the entire Pitt attack.
Defensively, Jerry Luxbacher, and
Mark Venanzi played exceptional-
ly, while Alan Jutca, Andy
Behrend, John Morahan, and Nick
Chrisanthon on offense beat the
Tartans to the ball all ‘evening long.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis was satisﬁed
with the Pitt win,
never have an easy game with
CMU. They have those prep school
kids who play a good game of
soccer. Although we could have
scored more goals, We’re happy
with a win.” ' .

The game was one the CMU team
wanted very badly, but couldn’t
put together an attack which could
have upset the Panthers. It was a
disheartened squad after the game,
but the CMU coach was realistic
about the defeat.

“Pitt played extremely well,”
CMU coach Al Yakisch said. “We
don’t get the type of player that Pitt
does, but we do the best we can.
We only get to practice one hour a

day because the kids have class
until 4:00, and this has its effect.”

The Panthers will need all the
practices they can muster before
Saturday's clash in Philadelphia
with Temple. Temple is a perennial
power with some excellent booters.

“They've got players that were
all-city, all-suburban, and every-
thing else,” Bemis said, shaking
his head. “They beat East
Stroudsberg 3-0 last week and East
Stroudsberg had a good team.

Majors Duels Dooley For Third

“Coach Dooley is a ﬁne coach and
has done an outstanding job
rebuilding what was once a very
lowly-rated program,” Majors
said, “but after the opening kick-
off, our friendship will cease.”

Both Pitt and North Carolina are
in the same boat. Last week the
Tarheels dropped their first game
of the season to Maryland, 24-12,
to run their record to 2-1. Like the
Panthers, Dooley will have. the
Tarheels looking to rebound from
defeat and cop their third victory.

Pitt’s loss to a powerful Southern
Cal team last weekend left Majors
with some thoughts about the
ability of his defensive squad as
well as his offense, primarily the
fact that the Cats have yielded an
overabundance of yards on the run.

Both USC and ‘Georgia Tech
employed a running attack with
little passing, and that is exactly
what Majors will have to stop in
North Carolina.

Before Dooley will insert much of
a passing game, he will try to
establish his running attack, and he
makes no qualms about using a
quartet of offensive backﬁeld stars
to reach his means.

The Tarheels employ a tailback
oriented offense with James
Betterson, a 6-0, 196 pound junior
who has rushed for 289 yards on 50
carries, and Mike Voight, a 6-1, 198
pound sophomore, 187 yards on 41

‘attempts, splitting the chores.

Dooley also alternates a pair of
quarterbacks and has had relative
success. Chris Kupec, a 6-3, 199
pound senior, and Bill Paschal], a
6-0, 175 pound junior, have logged
equal amounts of time directing the
Tarheels offense. ‘

Kupec is the better passer of the
two, with 20 completions of 28 tries
for 326 yards. But Paschall’s
statistics are by no means poor,

TONY DORSETT
six shy of 2000

13-21 and 204 yards.‘ That gives
the Tarheels a 67 per cent comple-
tion record, rdespite carrying the

reputation of a running team.

The favorite target of both passers

has been wingback Jimmy Jerome,

a 6-1 207 pound senior, who has
hauled in 14 aerialsfor 340 yards

and a pair of touchdowns.

But what has impressed Majors
the most is Dooley’s offensive

linemen.

"I'm impresses, with
aggressiveness,” Majors said
ﬁrmly. “They’re quick on their
takeoffs and will be one of the best
executing lines we’ve faced so
far."

the sweep with tight_end Andy
Chacos blocking in. Chacos, at 6-5
and 224 pounds, has also served as
an amiable pass receiver, hauling
in a 10 yard toss for the Tarheels
ﬁrst spore. against Maryland.

Steelers Over Houston,
"Wlmtevor It Takes”

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

In the lobby of the Steeler ofﬁce
there’s an inscribed football that
commemorates a remarkable Steel-
erlvictory: “October 3, 1971 —- 3
Goal-Line Stands -- Pittsburgh 21,
San Diego 17."

Fittingly, the ball also bears an
appropriate slogan: “Whatever It
Takes.” Joe Gilliam was still down
on Jefferson Street three years ago,
but he’s familiar with the saying.

“Yeah, ‘Whatever It Takes,’
that's our motto,” Gilliam said-.

‘But whatever it took wasn't good
enough last Sunday. We didn’t do
anything at all.” _

Since the season began“ the
Steelers have seemed to" be
collapsing in sections. First the
defense, which stiﬂed Baltimore
30-0 on opening day, allowed ﬁve
touchdowns to Denver.

Then the offense, which produced
448 yards and 35 points to tie the
Broncos, sagged to 203 yards and

no points last week against the’

‘Raiders.

Last year Pittsburgh averaged 22
passes per game and scored the
NF L's fourth most points -- 347 -- in
a 10-4 season. But so far this year,
they’ve thrown a staggering 40
times a game and stand just 1-1-1
despite facing what now stand as
the league's two worst defenses.
As a result, head coach Chuck Noll
has come under ﬁre for tampering
with a successful attack.

Noll appeased his critics _earlier
this week by admitting the'Steelers
should be running more. Gilliam,
who said last Sunday's play-calling
was “about 50-50" between Noll
and himself, agreed: “We hope it
doesn’t have to come down to
throwing 35 times a game. But, you

know, ‘Whatever It Takes.’ ”

was a team effort. Each and every
player played a major role. You
could go on and on yet they all are
true. Rarely had a team which
looked so bad early in the season
come back to take a title, and in
such a dramatic fashion at that.

pervaded the clubhouse after the
clinching game spread even to

Gerry Mullins. “We missed a lot of
assignments, - because we were
doing things we hadn’t worked on. '
We didn't play that much different
than we did against Denver, but
some days things just don’t come
off like they do other days.

“It’s no harder for us physically
when we pass more, like we have
been. We see a lot of 3-3 defenses,
and they put more pressure on the
receivers and less on the line. But,
when they use a three-man rush_
and stunt their linebackers, it's?‘
harder mentally to pick up the
variations, because you never know
who you'll be playing against.

“For example, I played both
guard and tackle, and I was playing
against Otis Sistrunk, Bubba
Smith, and that fourth linebacker
Monte Johnson at different times.

“Also, it's harder to run if you
don’t run a lot, because you lose
the quickness coming off the ball.”

back on its heels on most running
plays against the Raiders.

Indeed it has. This will be the

has scored only three touchdowns

Corbett Solidifies

er ANDY BEHREND

When Jim Corbett arrived at.Pitt
last year, he was one of a truckload
of highly touted freshmen brought
in by Johnny Majors, groomed for
immediate help. M

Certainly his credentials‘ were
impressive--All City from Eric
McDowell High Schoul and a
Pennsylvania Big 33 selection--the
ﬂrst Erie athlete to receive that
honor.

Corbett started out his freshman
season with the JV’:;, and slowly
manuvered his way to the big
squad, where he caught his only
two passes of the year in the Army
ﬁasco, and saw enough action
throughout the year to earn a

. letter.

When Jim Corbett arrived at Pitt
this year, Majors must have

dimensions. At camp in Johns-
town, when the horrid weather had
depleted Majors’ ranks, Corbe_tt
stayed healthy. ‘

“Things fell into place at
Johnstown,” Corbett recalled. “I
guess I was lucky not to get sick or
injured.”

From Johnstown up through the
USC game, the modest sophomore
has done nothing but open eyes,
from the awe-struck teammates
who remembered Jim as tall and
gawky, to the coaches, all of whom
beam at Corbett’s development.

_ “Jim Corbett is one of our most
‘improved players over last year’s
performance,” said Johnny Majors
candidly.

There is no fear of contradiction
from anyone about that statement.

When one walks into the plush
locker room facilities the football
team uses, Corbett’s name might

be the first thing they see. It is .
’mentioned under two awards‘

granted by the Panther coaches
each week.

The tight end was honored as
Player of the Week in both the
Florida State and Georgia Tech
games [sharing the tribute with

Tony Dorsett in the GT skirmish]-

Furthermore, Corbett earned the
Downfield Blocker award in the
Tech game, given to the guy who
knocks the most guys on their
butts. '

The Southern California game
probably won’t have Jim’s name
adorning any poster in the locker
room. He was a bit displeased with
his effort.

“My blocking isn’t what it should

be. I hit guys too high against
Southern Cal, but this is something
i’ll learn not to do with experi-
ence.” .

There is, with good reason, some
consternation over the ineptness of
Pitt’s offense. Corbett thinks one
way to solve the predicament is to
go to the air more. He humbly
failed to mention himself among
the class receivers at Pitt, but
lauded every other end in
existence, most notably his back-
ups, Jim Farley and Jinx Johnson.

He is hardly displeased at his
current assignments however,
which include blocking, occasion-
ally clearing an area on his pass
pattern, and more blocking.

When asked why he didn’t toot his
own horn, Corbett replied, “If the
wind is blowing hard enough, the
horn will go off by itself.”

Ed Kirkpatrick and Dock Ellis got
into the act also. Ellis double-dared
any of the Pirates to throw Bob
Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press into
the shower. Nobody dared. Kirk-
patrick stormed the clubhouse
wearing only his “Dennis the
Menace” grin, conspiring with
various players about their plans
for the champagne bottles.

Willie Stargell and Al Oliver
remained calmer than most of the
players. Between champagne baths
they managed to answer a nearly
endless barrage of reporters’
questions before congratulating the
rest of the players. Jim Rooker did
much the same as did Bobby
Robertson and Richie Hebner.

Getting down to the business of
tomorrow's 1 pm playoff, the
Bucs face the ‘Dodgers, the only
team in baseball to win more than
100 games during the regular
season. The Pirates have a couple
of plusses going for them. The
Dodgers have failed to come up
with a victory at Three Rivers this
season in six tries and their relief
ace, Mike Marshall has been
battered by the Bucs more than any
