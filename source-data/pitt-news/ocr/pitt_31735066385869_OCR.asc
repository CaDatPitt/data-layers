Bush's work-study

plan raises concern  

ByKatie Malaspina
Staff Writer
President George Bush’s

proposal requiring students, along
with all other public employees
not presently covered by Social
Security, to pay Social Security
taxes has raised some concern
among Pitt administrators.

“This could go way beyond an
impact on college work-study
students. It could affect graduate
categories as well,” said Lou
‘Tronzo, director of Federal and
Local Relations at Pitt. The
graduate category could include
graduate—stu dent fellows, teaching
assistants and pre- and post-
doctoral students, “depending on
what the language [of the proposal]
looks like,” said T ronzo.

Social Security taxes employees
765 percent, and their employers
pay a matching amount. According
to T ronzo, this proposal, presented
in the president’s January budget
plan, could cost Pitt student-
employees $2 million as well as a
matching $2 million from the
university.

In a letter to Rep. William Coyne
(D—Pa.) and Sen. John Heinz (R-
Pa.), Tronzo said, “The tax would
represent an additional buiuéf.
that our students would have to
bear during the time in the
development of their professional
careers when they can least afford
the loss of income.”

Two years ago the full
committee of the House Ways

and Means Committee voted
against a similar proposal for a
Social Security tax, said Paul
Gordon, press secretary for
Coyne. Most of the members are
still on this committee now.

Rep. Adam Jacobs Jr. (D—Ind.),
a chairman who sat on Social
Security subcommittee hearings
last week, is “very skeptical of
this proposal, ” said Gordon. “Even
at the early stages, the prospects
don’t look good for [the proposal
to get through the subcommittee]
right now.”

Janet Lieberman, legislative
director of the United States
Student Association, said, “It has
been standard procedure in the
past [that students have been

exempted from the Social Security ,

tax]. When youtake money out
of students’ paychecks, you’re
making it much harder for them
to remain students. They can’t
keep up with their expenses.”
The average college work-study
student at Pitt works 1 1 hours per
week, said Cynthia Dilucia of the
work-study office. This proposal
would force students “to work
extra hours each week [in order]
to come home with the same
amount ‘ of money,” said

‘Lieberman. She also said that

financial-aid packages might be
altered if the Bush proposal goes
through.

Suzanne McCo1loch of the
Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid disagreed, saying

ceremony.

Milliones said that it’s important

mistakes, he added.

At the ceremony, the 1990-91
BAS officers were sworn in,
including Chairperson Doug

Effinger and members of next
year’s Steering Committee.

The new officers, who swore to

BAS Chairperson Terri Tinnen
discussed the problems and
progress taking place during her
tenure.

“We have taken progressive
measures, though not radical
measures,” she said.

“I am pleased to have no
reservations in welcoming the
new committee,” Tinnen said,
suggesting the lack of black
students and faculty members at
the University of Pittsburgh as
issues for the officers to address.

“You have been a leader par
excellence, ” James Raymond said
of Tinnen. BAS adviser Raymond
served as Master of Ceremony.

“When asked what I expect
from the BAS next year, the reply
is simply, ‘everything,’ “ Ligons
said in his inaugural address.

For the upcoming year, Ligons
suggested problem—solving
through determination.

“Thought into action—— it seems
to me that that’s what it’s all

“As Doug said, the struggle
needs to be waged at all levels,”
Milliones said.

He suggested church
involvement and tutoring in

Milliones cited statistics relative
to black males.

“We kill each other,” he said.
I The highest mortality rate for
black males is between the ages
of 16 and 24, and homicide is the
No. 1 killer, he said.

Milliones also cited drug abuse

Students enjoy Spring
Fling despite went/oer

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Dark clouds hung over the
Spring Fling river cruise on the
Gateway Clipper Fleet’s Partyliner
yesterday afternoon, but, inside
the boat the party went on.

The boat carried 135
participants, most of them Pitt
students, up and down both the
Monongahela and Ohio Rivers.
Both Resident Director Sue Uhazie
and Pitt Program Council Special

V Events Chairperson Erin Carney

were pleased with the attendance
on the first ever Spring Fling river
cruise.

“It [135] doesn’t seem to be a
lot of people because they are so
spread out.” said Uhazie. “It’s a
good turnout for being the first
lcruisel."

“I think it went over really well,
and I’d like to seea bigger crowd
next year,. ” Carney added. “I think
it will catch on. The first time out
for an event is always thin.”

The river cruise had a lot to
offer everyone. Many students
over the age of 21 drank at the
bar while still more people spent
the majority of their time dancing

, to the sounds of Pitt student band

“Justafax” and the music of disc
jockey Vick Terry.
Pitt sophomores Renee

0

Thompson and Lisa Becks spent
their time drinking and dancing
and claimed to be having a good
time.

“The drinks are a little
expensive, but the music is good
and everyone is having fun,”
Thompson said..

Despite the chilly, cloudy
weather, Pitt senior Mark Caputo
and his girlfriend Paula Dupe
spent most of the cruise on the
top deck of the Partyliner. “We
just wanted something that was
more scenic and quiet,” Caputo
said. .

The only complaint that the
guests had was the fact that no
food, aside from potato chips and
pretzles, was provided.

Ticket prices at $5.00 for Pitt
students and $7.00 for non-
students did not cover the costs of
the cruise, the majority of which
were picked up by the PPC.

Czech professor shares views

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

The swiftness of the changes
taking place in Czechoslovakia
is almost unbelievable,
according to Pavol Kvetko,
Ph.D., key speaker at The second
annual Thomas Kukcka
Memorial Award Lecture held
yesterday in the William Pitt
Union.

Kvetko is a visiting professor
from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
He is teaching Slovak literature
and culture classes at Pitt. Kvetko
addressed an audience that
consisted of many Slovak people
fromiaround the Pittsburgh area.
The historic agreement bringing
the Czech and Slovak peoples
together was signed in
Pittsburgh. “To give an
exhaustible account of what
happened in Czechoslovakia
and all of the current changes 
would take a whole book,”

Kvetko said. When he came to
Pittsburgh in August, many
people asked him about the
reforms that were taking place
in Eastern Europe. Kvetko
would always remark that
changes would come, but his
answer would always spark a
lot of disbelief.

The revolution that took
place in November 1989 has
been called the “Velvet
Revolution.” Some people are
dubbing it “the 10 days that
shook Czechoslovakia.”
Students, intellectuals and the
common man bonded together
to bring about the democratic
changes that are happening
now. “Itwas a growing number
of citizens from all walks of
life,” Kvetko said.

“All of [al sudden, like a fairy
tale the regime was out, and
the revolution was here,”
Kvetko said. “It happened so
soon, so quickly and

peacefully.” Kvetko also
expressed shock at how quickly
the changes occurred. Kvetko
labeled the revolution “... the
beginning of radical changes.”

Critics all over the world are
questioning the abilities of
revolutionary intellectuals to
lead Czechoslovakia back to a
stable economic and democratic
state. The newly elected
President Havel was a poet
before being elected to serve.
Kvetko jokingly reminded his
audience that Ronald Reagan

was an actor once. “In the"

course of our history  any
Slovak or “Czech [leaders] were
poets, writers and priests.”
Kvetko also commented on
the free elections that will be
held injune. “People somehow
believe that placing morality
above politics will lead to free
elections.” The last free elections

held in Czechoslovakia took’

GQ Pablis/oer Clmtom Pittgraa’ becomes ’Z9z'gfz's/9

GQ Publisher Michael Clinton

Paul Diamond/T he Pitt News‘

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

Even before Michael Clinton
graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh in 1975, he
wallpapered his apartment with
rejection letters from the nearly
200 compahies to whom he had
sent his resume.

At age 35, he is now publisher
of an upscale men’s fashion and
news magazine with a readership
of 4.5 million and a title
internationally synonymous with
style: Gentlemans Quarterly

Armed only with an English
writing and economics degree,
the road to a top position in lils
field was long and CIFCUILOUS, the
former Pitt News editor and
business manager said at an
informal luncheon on Friday.

“The debate is: Should you be
a big fish in a slrnall pond or a big
fish in a big pond?” he said. He
chose the big pond where
national magazines are published
and careers are carved out: New
York.

Only about 10 people from his
high-school class of S00 went on
to college. He was the first person
from his blue—collar family to
receive a degree. He finished in
four years, paying his way with
jobs and loans. The day after his
last final exam, he boarded a
ﬂight to New York City with only
$60 in his pocket and no
professional contacts.

“I knew that the only way I was
going to get anywhere was
through hard work, diligence and
saying ‘I’m going to get there if it
kills me,”' Clinton said.

He applied for reporting
positions at virtually every major
magazine but finally settled for a
job as an executive trainee at
Lord and Taylor’s department
store. Clinton worked there,
learning about the men’s clothing
business for nearly two years.
Eventually, this knowledge
helped to land him a reporting
job at a trade newspaper. He
stayed with this company for
seven years. writing freelance for
in-ﬂight airline magazines and a
variety of trade publications, as
well as climbing the editorial and
management ladders.

For many artistic and creative
endeavors, New York is the only
place to be, Clinton said. He also
warned that New York is not for
everyone. “When you get there,
you gotta hustle. Just ‘cause you ’re
there doesn’t mean its going to
happen. The competition is
fierce,” Clinton told the group.
“But when you’re living in an
arena where there’s so much
excellence — it’s the convergence
point of all creativity. It stimulates
you as well as challenges you.”

He began selling advertising
and made the switch to the
company he works for now.
Surrounded by positive people,
he worked his way up to the top
position. As publisher of GQ, he
now enjoys such perks as
quarterly business trips to Europe!
with all expenses paid, meeting
movie stars, and receiving
invitations to “swanky” parties.

“A lot of it has to do with talent,
timing and luck. There are
probably 25 other 35-year-olds
who could probably do my job
better than I could, but the fact is
they don’t have my job,” he said.
“They’re not going to get it, either.”

T 0 stay on top, he often logs
12-hour days with crammed
agendas: meetings with
advertising representatives,
corporate account wine—and—dine
events and brainstorming sessions
with the magazine's editor. He
said that he almost never interferes
with the editorial content of the
magazine. His work primarily
concerns the business side of
GQ.

Clinton believes that you can
reach the top without stepping
on the toes of others, and he also
thinks that achieving success
usually involves changing jobs or
titles at least three times in the
first five years of a career.
Successful people somehow
figure out the next step towards
realizing their goals and do what
it takes to make it happen, he
said.

“You can’t look at your life as
a nine-to—five,” he said. “You’ve
got to look at your life as a
continuum and put into it
whatever it takes to make it
happen. There are people who
go to work at 9 o’clock and leave
at 5 o'clock and expect that they
should get everything and be the
one to get the next promotion.
That’s just not the real world.”

“There was no guarantee that 1
was going to get this job, no
guarantee whatsoever,” he said.
“That's the risk. You choose to do
it or you don’t.” The struggle has

THE PI'l'I' NEWS, Monday, April 2, 1990

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

One day ‘right after Don
Marbury moved into his first
house with his wife Sheila, some
neighbors came over while Don
was working and told Sheila that
“a celebrity” had just moved into
the neighborhood. Sheila, not
realizing that‘they were talking
about Don, proceeded to wait on
the house steps with her new
neighbors that afternoon to catch
a glimpse of the celebrity.

Marbury, now the director of
the Corporation for Public
Broadcast’s Television Program
Fund in Washington, D.C., told
that story to members of Panther
Prints and The Pitt News this
weekend as they honored him
with the Leo Koeberlein alumni
award. Marbury’s speech, ﬁlled
with personal anecdotes and
readings of original poetry,
brought the audience to its feet.

“I was incredibly moved. I
looked around to see how the

rest of the people were reacting
and [they] seemed taken back by
the power, sincerity and sheer
emotion of his speech,” said Lee
Gutkind, member of the Student
Publications Board and faculty
member.

A native of Pittsburgh, Marbury
began his , career at WQED
television station. There he held
many different programming and
reporting positions, including
executive producer of local
programming. He then moved to
the corporation for public
broadcasting where he was
involved in developing programs

such as Wonder World and De’

Grassi Junior High. In his current
job he is responsible for managing
a $45 million fund which is used
for several major public television
series.

Marbury has won several
national awards for production
and writing and has also won
awards for community action. He
has taught at several colleges and
is a published poet.

Alumnus finds success in broadcasting

He received his BA in English
from Pitt in 1971. Almost
immediately following graduation
he spent four months in Africa
building a school in a remote
part of Ghana.-

Gutkind, one of his teachers
while he was at Pitt, said that
Marbury was an exceptional
student.

“He is someone that you didn’t
easily forget and clearly a class
leader. I have been teaching for
a long time and it is only once in
a great while that you find a
student who had the kind of
respect and following that he
had,” said Gutkind.

While studying at Pitt, Marbury
servedras a student leader on
several fronts. He was the general
secretary of the Inter-cultural
House, an experimental project
where ten black students and ten

white students lived together. He .

has recently written a ﬁctionalized

book about the project, which he

expects to be published next fall.

males] need role models and
someone to work with them and
care about them on a regular
basis.

“You must bring your
leadership roles back to the
community,” he said to the BAS

— officers. “Otherwise, you become

part of the problem rather than
part of the solution.

Milliones addressed the BAS’s
concern about the lack of black

"faculty members and black

students at Pitt.

He suggested that the lack of
black professors at Pittis probably
worse now than it was in the
1960s and early 1970s. And the
rate of increase among black
students is not much better, he
added.

He addressed another BAS
concern by saying “the
realtionship between [the] black

_ studies [department] and the BAS,

I would suggest to you, needs
strengthening.”

number of political parties that
are forming. “Some sources say
that more than 50 political parties
were formed. A political party
needs 1,000 signatures,” Kvetko
stated. The-biggest parties that
are in existence today are parties
that support the democratic
movement. Kvetko feels that the
winning political party will get 30
to 40 percent of the vote. Kvetko

describes the possibility of a
Communist Party having a large
percentage of a vote as
“unrealistic.”

Kvetko also discussed how the
revolution has affected the
average citizen. “They are only
beginning to realize their rights
as citizens. There is a new freedom
of expression.”

The standard of living in
Czechoslovakia is relatively high
compared to other East European
counterparts. There is a low
percentage of inﬂation in the

country. “The economy was based
on a market where the
government said what was to be
produced. Radical reforms mean
a restructure of the market,”
Kvetko said. Plans have already
been made to reevaluate the
economy and to convert to a
free-market system.

Kvetko summed up his
description of the Czechoslovak
state; “without work there is no
gain." But Kvetko feels that the
Czechoslovak people are willing
to work for that gain.

Separating Church <9 college

Publication of The Cabinet, the student newspaper of
Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa., has been stopped for
the rest of the semester because of a so-called anti-
Catholic editorial written by student editor Eric Dugan.

Geneva College spokesman William Gibbs noted that

the editorial “absolutely produced a firestorm of com-

plaints.” The college’s Student Publication Board, which
is made up of two faculty and staff members and eight
students, voted 8 to 2 to suspend publication.

The editorial was titled “Theology of the Pointy Hats,”‘“~
in reference to clerics of the’ Catholic Church. The
editorial stated that clerics had become authoritarian and
that their councils and traditions “supersede scripture.”
The editorial concludes with a fiery statement: “And he
who holds to teachings which contradict the Bible finds
a final resting place with the serpent.” '

Now, this type of language may sound a bit harsh and,
indeed, possibly anti-Catholic. However, it turns out that
the gist of the editorial was basically a reaffirmation of the
beliefs espoused by Martin Luther, the 16th-century
Protestant religious reformer.

Luther’s goal was for Protestants to read and interpret
the Bible on their own rather than relying on the
interpretations of clerics as Catholics do. Luther’s follow-
ers were free to question the meaning of the Scripture. He
aimed to make the relationship between man and God a
more personal one. The editorial reiterates this doctrine
by saying, “The Catholic, however, finds most of his faith
and practice moored in the sayings of popes and councils,
which frequently contradict each other  And just what
if one pope isn’t exactly holy? Hiswords are still law.”

In commenting on the editorial, the Rev. Bruce C.
Stewart, president of _the Reformed Presbyterian Semi-
nary in Wilkinsburg, aptly said that the editorial reference
to “The Holy Pontiff of the pointy cap” was not appropri-
ate and that “If [Dugan] discusses doctrine, that’s one
thing. When he starts saying derogatory things as such,
then it becomes a problem. We have to be sensitive to the
way the other people feel and not attack them.”

Gibbs says that the shutdown was meant as an apology
to the school’s Catholic population. About 20 percent of
the Geneva student body is Catholic. He claims that the
board’s reaction wasn’t to censor, but rather to stop
publication in order to re-evaluate the editorial policy in
light of the newspaper’s constitution. But what exactly.
does “re-evaluate” mean? If it means that the Student
Publications Board aims to set the standards and guide-
lines by which Geneva’s college newspaper runs its
editorial policy, then such a measure would signify
censorship; it would essentially be telling the newspaper
what it can or cannot print. .

There is not much doubt that Dugan could have used
better judgment in his editorial, and he may have stepped
over the line. Surely, as an experienced editor, he knew
ahead of time that his editorial would be offensive.

\ However, the First Amendment stresses not only freedom

of religion but freedoms of the press and speech. Consti-
tutionally, Catholics attending Geneva are permitted to
exercise their religious _beliefs and express outrage over
Dugan’s editorial, and no one is taking those rights from
them. However, freedom of. the press is also protected
under the First Amendment, and that right is being taken
from Geneva’s student newspaper.

A writer's notes on current events 

There’s a lot to write about,
and not a lot of room, so:

-The University of Pittsburgh
made only $200,000 in royalties
on its logo last year. That’s pretty
low compared -to Penn State,
which made about $800,000, and
Notre Dame, which made over
$1 million.

So Pitt decided that they should
bring down the axe on The Uni-
versity Shop owner Jay McKen-
zie and his 28-year-old landmark.
They feel that they can take all of
the money that students are will-
ing to dish out for Pitt products,
instead of getting only a portion
of the money. Gee, wouldn’t it be
a shame if everybody just kind of
ignored the place when it reo-
pened?

oWhile I’m on the subject of
royalties, Pitt is also in an uproar
(no pun intended) over the Primo
Panther Condoms being sold by
a couple of Carnegie Mellon
University students. Pitt claims
that the picture on the package is
an infringement on their logo. Of
course, the Pitt logo actually looks
like a panther which is ready to
tear into anything that gets in its
way (i.e., The University Shop),
while the panther on this pack-
age looks like it would rather be
doing something else. Well,
anything to make a buck, I guess.

oPitt is also planning to rip out
the parking meters and grass in
the Hillman Library parking lot in
favor of 80 more spaces in a pay-
by-the-hour lot. They will be

charging $1 for the first hour, 50
cents for the next two hours, and
$1 for each hour after that. They
say that they want a high turn-
over rate. Excuse me for asking,
but what happens to the com-
muters who have classes all day?
Prices for them will be a lot
higher.

-At the beginning of the Grey-
hound bus strike, I heard possi-
bly the stupidest remark ever
made to a reporter. A representa-
tive of the drivers said, “[Grey-
hound management] is using the
violence as an excuse for not

bargaining in good faith.” Per-
sonally, I think it's a damn good
reason not to deal with them.

Speaking of deals, I overheard
a great way to deal with these
gun-happy drivers. For every shot
that hits a bus, Greyhound should
fire 10 drivers at random. If
somebody gets hurt, fire more.
Granted, some people might call
that union-busting, but violence
must be dealt with severely;
otherwise, it's just an excuse to
use it more.

-Well, the Lithuanians seem to
be backing down in the face of
the Russian Bear. Big surprise.

Intimidation can do wonders
against a ﬂedgling secession.

But give the Soviets credit. They
told the world that they wouldn't
use violence against the Lithuani-
ans, and they didn't. They used
the closest alternative. They‘
calmly drove a column of ar-
mored transports into Vilnius
(Lithuania’s capital city) and
began rounding up “troublemak-
ers” from the hospitals and gov-
ernment buildings.

No, Gorbachev hasn't crushed
this revolt, like his predecessors

would have. But he is putting
them into a large vice, squeezing
the spirit out of them.

Too much publicity for gays

I am writing this letter because
I am personally sick and tired of
reading articles and letters pub-
lished in The Pitt News advocat-
ing homosexuality. With the
exception of one letter to the
editor, other views on the issue
are not given equal time. With-
out condemning the -few mem-
bers of our society who are
homosexual, I wish to plead my
case.

Let me start by stating that I am
not supportive of gay bashing,
nor do I think that any form of
discriminatory action against
anyone is correct. I am a firm
believer that people are entitled
to their own opinions, and pref-

erences, but I also think that The
Pitt News coverage of the gay
movement has been a little over-
done. »

Letters

By continually printing articles
that advocate homosexuality in a
form of media as widely circu-
lated as ThePz'ttNews, I am afraid
that those people who read The
Pitt News will believe that the
advocation of homosexuality is a
commonly held opinion at the

University of Pittsburgh. I don’t
believe that it is a commonly held
opinion, and find it hard to under-
stand why it has been given so
much publicity. _

I don’t think that the University
of Pittsburgh has an abundance
of homosexuals and I don’t think
we have a problem with gay
bashing. There is therefore no
need to give them so much
publicity. Editors of TheP1'ttNews,
let gays do their own things, and
go easy on the articles about
them. At least one of your read-
ers wishes not to know, about
them.

Conversing with aLithuanian about Gorby and Lithuania

We are fortunate to have a very
gifted physics student named
Gintas Vilkelis studying at the
University of Pittsburgh. Gintas
hails from Vilnius, the capital of
Lithuania. He has been very busy
these last few days circulating
petitions, making telephone calls
and trying to keep up with devel-
opments in his country, but I was
still able to speak with him for
several minutes on Wednesday.
This conversation gave me,a great
deal of insight into the events
which have occurred in his na-
tion over the past week.

From 1918 to 1940, Lithuania
was a free, sovereign nation, as
were the neighboring republics
of Estonia and Latvia. This happy
state of affairs ended abruptly
when, due to a secret provision
of the Soviet—Nazi nonaggression
pact, they were forcibly annexed
by the Soviet Union Since then,
many Russians have moved in
and imposed their language and
culture, not to mention their social
system, on an unwilling popu-
lace.

The Lithuanians in return had
to express gratitude to the Sovi-
ets for “liberating” them from the
Nazis, as 500,000 of them were
executed in Soviet purges. Gintas
explained to me that he and his
fellow students were taught in
elementary school to say such
things.

“A Russian can say he is proud

of Russia and being Russian, and
he is considered patriotic,” said
Gintas, “but a Lithuanian who
said this would be called a na-
tionalist, and his career would be
seriously harmed.” He went on
to describe how in neighboring
Byelorussia, the Byelorussian
language and culture have been
nearly completely eliminated
Also, in most republics the street
signs are in Russian only. Lithu-
ania has generally avoided this,
luckily, despite the inﬂux of eth-
nic Russians who now make up
10 percent of the population.
“They come to get a better stan-
dard of living, ” Gintas said. “There
is a joke about a Siberian want-
ing to visit Lithuania and his
neighbor being afraid because
cannibals must live there. After
all, everyone he knew who went
there never came back."

Gintas Vilkelis was particularly
outspoken about criticism of
Lithuania's recent actions by
leaders of Estonia, another Baltic
republic. “They have fewer op-
tions because only 60 percent of
the population of Estonia is made
up of Estonians.”

Besides, he stated, it is not
good for the United States and
other nations to argue about what
should have been done now that
these actions have already been
taken. Such disagreement would
undoubtedly jeopardize the
Lithuanian position against the

Russians.

According to Gintas, an all-out
Soviet invasion with large num-
bers of forces and the imposition

l

 

Rob
Lewis

of martial law will probably never
occur. Rather, the Soviets will
slowly pick and pinch off the
opposition bit by bit in what he
calls the “salami-slicing method.”
(Gorbachev prefers to use a ﬁnely
sharpened Hobart salami slicer
rather than the meat cleaver
reminiscent of the days of send-
ing tanks into Prague.) In fact,
this has started already. The
Soviets have ordered Lithuanians
to turn in their weapons, have
ordered foreign reporters out of
the republic and have taken into
custody Lithuanian deserters from
the Red army. Troops have also
recently taken over the chief
prosecutor's office and the news-

paper printing plant. These pro-
vocative actions have had little
effect on world opinion — they
are just several thin slices of

- salami gone. The West will never

express outrage because it will
not notice the minor slices
(changes). If such actions con-
tinue, though, the salami will
eventually be whittled away with
little outcry from the West at all.

Should a more violent reaction
be chosen by Gorbachev, Gintas
said he would be very afraid to
return. He believes the KGB has
a file on him, especially since he
is studying in the United States.
He mentions that the line went
dead during several phone con-
versations with his parents when
the conversations became too
political. Even in the era of
glasnost, Soviet society is not
nearly as open to debate as ours.

When asked what America,
speciﬁcally the Bush administra-
tion, should do for the Lithu-
anian people, Gintas insisted that
we should immediately recog-
nize the government led by Presi-

’ dent Landsbergis, thus giving it

enough international credibility
to be able to negotiate with the
Soviet government more equally.
“The U.S. should not merely call
for negotiations between the
Lithuanian government and the
Soviets,” he said. “Gorbachev,
politically, cannot negotiate with
what is considered by the Soviets

Academy's ignorance not racism is reason for no

During last week's 62nd Acad-
emy Awards ceremony, Kim
Basinger livened the dreadfully
dull evening with her glowing
looks and ﬁesty tongue. While
introducing one of the films
nominated in the category of Best
Picture, Basinger took the initia-
tive on live television to add that
Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing
ought to have been nominated as
well. The crowd responded with
enthusiastic applause, and some-
thing of a national sentiment was
acknowledged: that Lee's ﬁlm
was one of the finest ﬁlms in
recent memory, and his exclu-
sion from consideration for top
honors was a palpably racist
gesture on the part of the Acad-
emy.

Unfortunately, this writer feels
obligated to argue that the fuss
regarding Lee's exclusion was
inappropriately attributed only
to racism.

That I would not be the first to
laud the tidal wave of criticism in
response to the omission of Do
the Right Thing would appear to
be something of an absurdity. As
a budding and avid ﬁlm scholar,
this writer offers his humble
opinion that Mr. Lee is one of
America's two or three most gifted
of a large body of active
ﬁlmmakers. His young body of
ﬁlms is fresh, and his cinematic
vision speaks in tongues of gen-
ius. It would seem apparent that
the future has no other realistic
course of action but to declare
Lee as an autuer in the same

grand tradition of Hitchcock-,.

Welles, Ray and the like. I have
seen Lee's ﬁlms several times
each and consider Do the Right

Thing one of ' the very ﬁnest‘
American ﬁlms of 1989; it was
certainly far superior to any of
those ﬁlms nominated for Best
Picture. T
Secondly, I am in full agree-
ment with Lee's concerns over
racism in our country. Certainly,

he could have made stylish ﬁlms '

such as She's Gotta Have It
throughout the duration of his
career and avoided controversy
altogether. It is a shame that our
media has suggested that Lee is
militant, and it is even more out-
rageous that his most recent film
was feared to ignite riots. Blacks
are certainly not wild animals
that cannot respond to art with
intellectual sophistication, as the
media seemed to imply. Racism
is a real issue of our time; films of
our day need to address racism’s
current manifestations in society.

Yet nothing I have voiced thus
far would serve as adequate evi-
dence to condemn the Academy
on grounds of racism. For those
who might not keep abreast with
the movie industry, here is a brief
explanation: Spike Lee's ﬁlm Do
the Right Thing was critically
acclaimed as one of the year's
best ﬁlms; it also happened to be
about racism in Bedford-
Stuyvesant and America, and was
somehow branded “controver-
sial.” It was nominated for two
Academy Awards (Best Screen-
play and supporting-actor nomi-
nation honors for Danny Aiello)
and won nothing.

The Academy's oversight should
simply not be considered-a racist
action and given attention to as
such. To begin with, Do the Right

Thing is, before anything else, a

film. The Academy awards Os-
cars to recognize the best in film;
the mistake was in a misjudg-
merit of art. Of course, the Acad-
emy might not have been im-
pressed with the media's nega-
tive “hype” of the ﬁlm in ques-
tion, but that does not mean the
mistake wasn't about the ﬁlm
instead of prejudice. To limit the
disappointment to the latter
would be to insult Lee as a
filmmaker, and on that level of
reasoning, Lee cannotbe consid-
ered a certiﬁable victim of white

 

Michael
Moore

prejudice. Several of the best
ﬁlms and filmmakers in the his-
tory of cinema —- who have
been white and of the histori-
cally oppressive European line-
age — have been ignored. Sir
Alfred Hitchcock never won a
single Oscar, and he made 53
ﬁlms, compared to Lee's less than
ﬁve. Fellinni never was able to
polish a coveted statuette, and
neither was Richard Burton,
among others. The abysmal piece
of celluloid oatmeal Out of Af-
rica won best picture, while The

African Queen was never even
nominated for ‘such an honor.
Last year's cute Working Girl was
nominated for Best Picture, while
classics such as Singing in the
Rain never were. Indeed, the
Academy has never been known
for having good taste. Lee may
join a whole host- of artists of
merit that have been ignored, but

such a group is hardly exclu- _

sively made up of blacks, nor is it
a ﬁeld entirely controversial.

Making Lee out to be a victim
of racism is insulting to the
filmmaker; he is a young artist
and is in good company with
legends that died as Oscar out-
casts.

It is also sad that so many have
accused the Academy of not
recognizing Lee's social agenda
as positive. The Academy — as
much as this writer disagrees
with it — ought not to be about
social agendas — only films. If a
film is about a social issue and is
explicit in such a treatment, that
would be ﬁne (and is often the
case) — but that should always
be considered after its cinematic
merit has been evaluated. Spike
Lee was passed up wrongly
because his ﬁlm was cinemati-
cally smashing -— an excellent
achievement indeed. Lee has

raised a great deal of political

consciousness throughout his
career: Do theRight Thinghelped
regenerate an interest in Malcolm
X; SchoolDazeencouraged a cer-
tain solidarity in black fraternal
organizations, and She’s Gotta
Havelthas been as helpful as any
recent production in promoting
positive black casting (his char-
acters were real, not slaves or

an illegitimate government. Also,
Lithuania will probably want
totally different things from the
talks than the Soviets. They want
to discuss terms of our rejoining
the U.S.S.R., while we want agree-
ments on terms of leaving.”

He blamed two factors on the
lack of outcry from the American
public: the American tendency to
look at the Soviet point of view
too much and the West’s roman-
ticizing of Gorbachev as a great
leader. A

“Gorbachev is brilliant in his
external affairs, but as far as eth-
nic and national issues are con-
cerned, he is a horrible politi-
cian,” Gintas noted.

Gintas Vilkelis came to this
country as a citizen of the Soviet
Union. It is his greatest wish to
return home as a citizen of the
free and independent nation of
Lithuania. I admire him greatly
for his efforts and pray they will
pay off in the end. The Lithu-
aniangovernment led by Presi-
dent Landsbergis faces seemingly
insurmountable odds at this point,
and only a concerted effort by
the West can ensure the peaceful
establishment of a Lithuanian
state. We should all encourage
the Bush administration to stand
firm on this issue and aid in any
way the true liberation of the
Lithuanian people.

Lee award  

drivers). But as commendable as _

this is, it is not the Academy's
duty to award social honors.
The finest ﬁlms of the year (in
this writer's opinion), including
The Fabulous Baleer Boys, Drug
Store Cowboy, Roger and Me and
Chocolat were all ignored; not
one of those ﬁlms was made by
a black ﬁlmmaker. One can talk

about the Oscar's white-bread -

taste, but racism is harder to
prove, and to make it an issue in
I.ee’s rejection would be a point-
less endeavor. Martin Luther King
Jr. once remarked somethingto
the effect that to befriend some-
one because he or she is black is
as insulting as avoiding that per-
son for the same reason. To make
Mr. Lee's race the issue places
undue emphasis on the very
meaningless source of distinc-
tion that those for equality should
stay away from.

With or without the Oscar, Lee
and his recent ﬁlm remain among
our most honored. He did win

the Los Angeles Film Critic's Circle _

Award and received far more
attention than films such as Dead
Poets’ Society did, which was
nominated for a slew of Oscars,
and beat Lee's screenplay in that
category. Lee was gracious after
the ceremony (he even
complimented sex, lies and
videotdpe, the ﬁlm that beat his
own at Cannes, which is consid-
erably less of an accomplishment
than Thing). In dignity, Lee ar-
ticulated that he hoped “to ‘be
back in the future." '

Pitt overcome by WVU in final gymnastics meet

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, WV — It was a barn burner, but the Lady
"Panthers gymnastics team let the West Virginia Mountaineers
slip by for a 185.40 to 184.30 win at the West Virginia Coliseum.

This past weekend’s meet closed out the Lady Panthers’
regular season. They ﬁnished with a record of 7-8: 8-15 overall,
including tournaments. .

The Lady Panthers opened the WVU competition with two

new surprises; the first being their new leotards and the second
being several strong uneven parallel bars performances, which
gave the Pitt squad a" score of 45.35.
S “I was a little worried at the beginning, but it was great. I love
nailing a bar routine,” said freshman Beth Dyson, who holds a
personal season- high score of 37. 10 in the all-around event. “It's
not the bar routine I want to keep throughout my collegiate
career; there are a few more tricks I’d like to add.”

High scores on the uneven parallel bars for the Lady Panthers
were turned in by Dyson (9.30), Robyn Borchers (9.25) and
Kathy Wallish (9.00). “I was really pleased that I hit my routine
because in the last two meets I’ve had problems,” said Borchers.
“I’ve been working bars a lot in practice, and I was able to bring
things together tonight."

While the Lady Panthers were performing the vault, their
second event, they were receiving an especially obnoxious
reception from three members of the West Virginia crowd, who
were escorted out of the Coliseum by WVU security.

time as

Jennifer Butkovich, who has been out of the Lady Panthers’
lineup for a month while recovering from mononucleosis, set a
new season-high record for vaulting with a score of 9.4.

“I’m very excited to be back. There were guys in the stands that
were beingreally rude, and I wanted to nail my vaglt just to prove
to them that we are a good team," said Butkovich.

Turning in‘ strong vaults for the Pitt squad were Butkovich
(9.40), Gina Venezia (9.25), Dyson (9.20), Borchers (9.10) and
Shelly Sleith (9.00).

Enteringinto the third round of competition, the floor exercises,
the Lady Panthers trailed the Mountaineers by an eighth of a
point. —

The Lady Panthers displayed their usual strong routines on the
ﬂoor, but their performances were a little bit off.

“Right now, our endurance is down a little bit,” said Yohman.
“They are coming off of the ﬂoor huffing and pufﬁng, and their
last dance is not quite as good, so we are going to be running
a little bit in practice this week.”

Strong ﬂoor performances were turned in by Tina Taylor with
a 9.65, -~ the third- highest school record on the floor, Karen
Jorgensen (9.40), Wallish (9.35), and Venezia and Dyson, both
of whom scored 9.25.

The Lady Panthers managed to narrow the gap between the
Mountaineers and themselves down to a mere ﬁfty-ﬁve hundredths
of a point. During the fourth and ﬁnal round of the competition,
the Lady Panthers were on the balance beam, one of their
strongest events.

Bulls hit big

By Geoﬂ’ Moskowitz
Staff Writer

As the Major Indoor Lacrosse
League's newest franchise, the
Pittsburgh Bulls didn’t exactly
follow the standard course for an
expansion team this season.

For instance, the Bulls ﬁnished
with a 3-5 record, putting them in
a position to challenge for a MILL

’ playoff spot. In comparison, the

New England Blazers, last year’s
expansion team, ended the
season in last place with a 1-7
record. But that's not the only
reason the Bulls’ season was

' unique.

Bulls forward Brian Nikula
scored the ﬁrst goal of the 1990
MILL season back onJan. 5 against
the Blazers. He not only scored
the team and league season-ﬁrst
goal but proceeded "to score the
first hat trick, the ﬁrst four— goal
game and the ﬁrst six- pointeffort
by a Bull, adding two assists in
the team’s ﬁrst win.

Nikula’s performance led to
the Bulls’ ﬁrst Coors Light MVP
award. But more importantly,
Nikula continued his offensive
rampage throughout the eight-
game season, ending as the MILL’s
regular—season goal leader. He
cashed in 20, averaging 2.5 per

game.
Not long after Nikula scored
his first goal, Kevin Forrester was
the ﬁrst Bull to visit a MILL penalty
box. Forrester instigated the Bulls’
first ﬁght with Blazer Walt Cataldo.
Each man received ﬁve minutes
for ﬁghting, paving the way for
Forrester’s league-leading 28
penalty minutes. Forrester
amassed his minutes with just six
. penalties in the same number of
;games.

Johns Hopkins graduate Dave
1Pietramala helped add yet another
lﬁrst in the penalty category. The
1989 NCAA Player of the Year,

lDefensive Player of the Year and

consensus First Team All-
American. ﬁnished just two
minutes behind Forrester to give
the Bulls. at 1-2 punch in league-
leading penalty minutes.

As a team, the Bulls were tops
in league-shooting percentages,
averaging 68.9 percent of their
shots on goal. The Bulls directed
385 of their 559 shots on the (net.

One first the team wasn’t
counting on was having to watch
the MILL’s three—team playoff from
the stands.

If the DetroitTurbos had beaten
the Baltimore Thunder, and the
Wings had done the same to the
New York Saints on March 24,

far as expansion teams concerned

. the Bulls would have joined New

England and Philadelphia in
postseason play. Detroit lost 18-
9, and Philadelphia lost 8-5,
stopping the momentum that
propelled the Bulls’ playoff hopes :$
in their ﬁnal home victory against

Detroit on March 17.

Bulls head coach Dennis Wey
was extremely optimistic after
the win. Wey said that he felt the
Bulls’ playoff chances were very
good, but the rest of the league
proved uncooperative.

pointed, but we know what it’,

West is thought of, the first thing
that comes to mind is power. ‘Bo
Jackson, Jose Canseco, Mark
McGwire and Ruben Sierra lead
the AL West in frightening
opposing managers with their
ability to instantly place a ball in
orbit. Even though that is still the
case in 1990, the pitching staffs
could equal the scare factor set
by the hitters. This division has
become the best in baseball with
its off—season acquisitions and its
maturing talent.

The Kansas City Royals are the
first team in history to have both
of the previous year’s Cy Young
award- winning pitchers. The
Oakland Athletics have a healthy
Canseco to start the season. The
California Angels have added to
an already deep starting staff with
the free— agent signing of Mark
Langston. The Texas Rangers have
a hungry young group of hitters
led by Sierra. The Seattle Mariners
are hoping to get another big
year from sophomore center

slightly deeper in the pitching
department than the Oakland
Athletics, and that should be
enough to push them to the top of
the division. Cy Young-winner
Bret Saberhagen is the ace of the
staff. Last year he won 23, lost six
and had an earned-run average of
2.16. He has had problems in
even-numbered years in his career
with a record of 31-39, but with
the team that is around him this
year, don’t look for that to happen
again in 1990. Mark Gubicza won
15 games last year and had an
ERA of 5.04. He could be the ace
of any other staff in baseball.
Second-year righty Tom Gordon
is looking to avoid the sophomore
jinx. Last year as a rookie, he won
10 games in the first half of the
season coming out of the bullpen
and won seven as a starter in the
second half. Combine that with
his 153 strikeouts (10th in the AL)
and there stands another
outstanding pitcher. The fourth
and fifth spots in the rotation will
go to Storm Davis and Rich
Dotson. Davis comes over from
the A’s through the free-agent
market. The Royals hope the
minus from the A’s and the
addition for themselves will be
enough to put them over the top.

Defense leads volleys
to Win over Allegheny

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt mens volleyball club defeated Allegheny College on
Sunday at Trees Hall, but only after having to fight for every point
they scored to bury the Gators with 3-1 game match.

The Panthers opened up the weekend competition on a sour note.

1 There were no referees or line judges, and only seven of the club’s

members showed up for the match.

During the first game, the Panthers trailed the Gators 2-7, but made
a miraculous comeback to win the game 15-13.

“We were on about 30 percent of the time," said Steve Kitay about

Pitt’s offense during the match.

Kitay said that the Gators ran a strange offense, therefore creating
a peculiar defense, but the Panthers did not have a hard time

adjusting to it.

During the second game, the Panthers dominated the court and
swept the game enroute to a 15—7 win.

“They opened up running a 5~1, that’s a setter in the front row, so
he had the option of either setting it or dumping it into the front row,”
said John Szafranski, a back-row specialist for the Panthers. “We
covered the dumps, and they only had two hitters, so that made it
easier to play defense and dig the ball.”

The Panthers started the third game off on the wrong foot and

loosely as you wish), what goes
on under Mike Krzyzewski at
Duke is as close to idealistic as it
comes, while the pro franchise at
UNLV managed by Jerry
Tarkanian can only be disguised
as, what Tarkanian humbly calls
“a second chance.”

Duke and Krzyzewski strive
for the athletes who are superior
both on the hard court and in the
classroom, and they are proud of
that fact. Tarkanian, on the other
hand, thrives like a lamprey off

of their fitting the description of
the student—athlete (or even
athlete—student).

“My reputation started with
[former Long Beach State player]
John Q. Trapp,” said Tarkanian.
“He’d been dropped from three
schools. He was a problem to a
lot of guys. He was a mean, tough

E-'°-I

.-

guy, and I got a lot of recognition
because of him.”

Nothingwrong withbeing mean
and tough or even talking a little
trash on the court, but Trapp,
more or less, was a hood. And the
Lloyd Daniels business didn’t help
matters much, either. That’s the
stuff that really got Tarkanian
(also the world's greatest IUCO-
milker) all the notorious
recognition.

Graduation rates tell a similar
story: Duke, 100 percent; UNLV,
less than 15 percent. Tarkanian’s
alibi: “Some of the nicest kids are
not A—students.” ‘

Loyola-Marymount guard Tom
Peabody pretty much agrees, at
least about the nice—kid part. ‘‘I

think those guys get a bum rap. I
think they’re a class act. They
play so hard that they might say
something and people take it
wrong, but they’re a class act
from the coaches down to the
players.”

Yeah, Tom, but I’m sure Al
Capone could have been a
heckuva guy too, at times.

But one thing’s for sure:
Regardless of the outcome of the
game; there is something
distinctively symbolic about
tonight’s matchup between the
white hats and the black hats that
sums up the present state of
college athletics in general.

Combine both, and what you

Bulls

Continued from page 11
of our off-season energies will be
directed toward bettering our
‘efforts. of this past year," said
Wey.

Two months before the season
starts next winter, the league will
conduct its version of the college
draft. The MILL is unique in
professional sports because teams
pull talent from local NCAA
programs. The Bulls are an
exception to this rule. Penn State
is the only Pennsylvania school
this side of Harrisburg‘to play
intercollegiate lacrosse. So the
Bulls are forced to draw their
team members from Maryland, a
recognized lacrosse hotbed.

You really look for two things,”
Wey explained about MILL
drafting procedure. “You look
for good players coming from
good schools, but you also look
geographically. You don’t want
to draft a kid living in Syracuse,
N.Y., because we practice in
Baltimore. A kid can’t drive nine

hours just to practice.

“You have to look realistically
at guys you can and can’t draft.
We drafted one kid this year who
ended up moving to Boston, and
he’s now playing for New
England. Sometimes it’s a shot in
the dark.”

The Bulls are forced to practice
in Baltimore because many of the
team members reside and work
in the area. Unlike other
professional sports, MILL players
need to make their primary
incomes elsewhere.

Practicing in Baltimore rather
than the team’s hometown could
be seen as a disadvantage to the
Bulls. But Wey said this lS not the
case. “It’s not a factor because the
trip is only 35 minutes by air, and
it doesn’t take a whole lot of time
out of the players’ day. The guys
are feeling comfortable here and
getting‘. used ‘to the town; we
enjoy the town. It's a lot of fun
here.”

ended up trailing the Gators
throughout the game. As the third
game came to a close, the Panthers
stood defeated 15-12.

“We didn't have much offense
today,” said Panther setter Luke
Rubosky. “We ran pretty well
today, but we didn’t have enough
people today. We did pretty good
with the people we had.

“Allegheny’s defense was solid
throughout the matches. They
scrapped back after losing the
first two to win the third game,"
said Rubosky. “They had me
scared a little bit. We were playing
bad, and they started coming on
pretty good.”

The Panthers wereable to pull
themselves together during the
fourth game to overpower the
Gators and win 15-3.

“Our defense played well,” said
Rubosky. “John Szafranski and
Greg Lockley never let anything

M hit the ﬂoor.”

“The Allegheny defense was
able block pretty well, ” said Coach
Steve Hoffman, “but luckily our
hitters were strong, and we tended
to power the ball? through the
block. ,

“We quickened our offense up

a little bit and made them get on
their heels and play defense rather
thantrying to get their offense to
work.”

West
Continued from page 11
ageless wonder Nolan Ryan. Some
players to keep an eye on will be
righty Kevin Brown, rookie third
baseman Scott Coolbaugh and
Gary Pettis, who will be at the top
of the order. The major plus for
this franchise is not only the
youthful team but also the youth
of the front office. Manager Bobby
Valentine is entering his sixth
season and still has his cockiness
that will always keep the Rangers
on their toes. General manager
Tom Grieve is not afraid to make
the deal to significantly help the
Rangers, unlike a certain GM in
Pittsburgh. I’m. not mentioning
any names. Larry Doughty. I'm

sorry; it slipped.

The Minnesota Twins have
not been the same team since
Gary Gaetti took a new look on
life and calmed down; The Twins
need his leadership in the
clubhouse, and he no longer
provides that. The brightest star
shining in the twin cities comes
from the ability of Kirby Puckett,
the best right-handed hitter in all
of baseball. He can hit for average
(career .323) and some power.
Puckett is already penciled in as
the Gold Glove winner in the
outfield. Other than Puckett, the

Twins are in a transition time. By
trading Frank Viola last season,
the team made a commitment to
building around Allan Anderson
in the pitching staff. With youthful
Rick Aguliera, David West and
super-prospect Willie Banks
coming along, the bad times for
the Twinkies won't last long.

The Seattle Mariners are in
trouble. They have a gem of a
first baseman in Alvin Davis, so
what do they do in the off- season?
They sign Pete O'Brien to play
first so they could move Davis to
designated hitter. Mr. Davis is not
happy, and now he wants to be
traded. If the Mariners do trade
him, they should be able to get
some great pitching prospects.
But with this organization, you
never know what could happen.
As Glenn Wilson said when he
got traded from Seattle: “Thanks
for getting me from the gates of
Hell.” At least they haven’t done
anything to upset Ken Griffey Jr.
yet.

The Chicago White Sox. How
many‘can you name? Do you
know their manager? I had to do
a lot of research to find out who
he was. If the White Sox finish in
the same galaxy as the A's and
Royals, it will be a major news

item. Players to watch will be
rookie third-baseman Robin
Ventura, steady closer Bobby
Thigpen and their hitting coach
Walt Hrniak. Last year, he
improved their team average by
27 points, but they have no power
besides Ivan Calderon. Can he
continue the improvement? Jeff
T orborg —-— he is the manager; at
least for now.

The Pitt squad counted three
falls on the beam. Taylor had a
bad roundoff and scored an 8.95,
Venezia scored a 9.00 and
Borchers scored an 8.8.

Scoring above a 9.00 for the
Lady Panthers on the beam were
Brown (9.45), Wallish (9.40),
Dyson (9.55) and Venezia (9.00).

The Lady Panthers said that the A

rivalry that they have with WVU
goes deeper than the ones that
other Pitt teams have.

“There are a couple of girls that
are old team rivals, and it did get
everyone to be a little bit more
aggressive than usual,” said
Dyson.
