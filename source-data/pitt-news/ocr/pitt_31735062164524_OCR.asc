Stern Masters Support;    
Able Party Voices Concern

Not Sure of Win

Until Election Eve

35' AL JANEZIO

Student . Government (SG) President-
elect Eric Stern is a winner who didn’t
expect to win. ‘

Stern, an Independent ‘backed by the
Pitt Progressive Party (PPP), said he did
not expect to win until the eve of the election
when he noticed a change in student attitude in
his favor.

“I expected it to be very close,” he said, “but
didn’t expect to win until a day and a half before
the election. I noticed the change at a rally Tues-
day night in the Towers. People that I didn’t think
would support me did.”

Stern claimed his victory was a combination
of factors, among them his endorsement by the
PPP. This came about, he explained, partially be-
cause of a, strong reaction after the Able Party
falsely accused him of participating in" the Fair
Play for Cuba organization. Stern said the state-
ment helped shift support to him.

Three weeks ago, though, he was not even
thinking of rimning for SG president. But then “I

Able Party Ponders
Over Future of SG

By BOB SMIZIK
Leaders of the Able Party, soundly re-
pudiated in Wednesday’s Student Govern-
ment (SG) election, promised to “act as a
responsible minority party,” but wondered
aloud about the future of SG as it will be

run by President-elect Eric Stern.

Jerry Hogan and Marty Engles, both winners
in the election, talked like losers as they set about
to pick up the pieces of their party at a caucus
Thursday night.

Engles, chairman of the party, was the only
Able candidate for Liberal Arts Senate to win a
seat. Hogan, the Able vice-presidential candidate,
won unopposed. ’

Both wondered about Stern’s ability to work

A with members of the administration.

Said miglesz “Considering the fact that one of
the basic ideas of Stern’s platform was that if he
couldn’t work with the administration he would
work against them, I have my doubts. I hope he
will modify this view so that SG can achieve the
success it has under John Vrana.”

R ' H I i?
evrew S.
By BARRY SHAW

Weinstein’s Kennilworth
Restaurant at Center and
Negley Avenues is present-
ing a musical review entitled
“High Time.” It is a. some-
times contrived yet contin-
ually entertaining show con-
sisting of a series of humor-
ous skits and .musical numbers
about everything under the sun.
It is well worth seeing for its
delicious bits of wit and song.
And if it does nothing else, it
certainly adds a delightful di-
mension to dining out in Pitts-
burgh.

“High Time” stars Terry Mc-
Govern, Cathy Carter, Marlie
Stone and Jeff Hohenstein. All
are local talent who attended
Duquesne University, Carnegie
Tech, Pittsburgh Playhouse and
the University, respectively. All
are very talented.

Unfortunately, the night that
this reviewer saw the show, Terry
McGovern, supposedly the fun-
niest number of the cast, was
absent. Nevertheless, the show
was a success, and it was hard

 

‘High Time’

to believe that anyone could have
topped these three standards.

Jeff Hohenstein carried the hu-
mor of the show. He had much
of the mannerisms of Shelley
Berman about him, but not
enough to make him offensive.
His timing was practically perfect
and much creditmust go to him
for keeping the show humorous
while McGovern was absent Ho-
henstein also took his turn at a
song, and the result turned out
to be the funniest number in the
show, entitled “I’m in Love with
a North Side Girl.”

Cathy Carter and Marlie Stone
were both very appealing as sing-
ers and dancers, Marlie having
the more powerful voice of the
two. Her last song, “Like You,”
was very beautiful indeed and
created .a mood that was not
equalled during the show.

Cathy, on the other hand, had
a softer voice, also capable of
dramatic effects, though not quite
as startling as Marlie’s. Her “Just
What I Wanted” was as touching
as could be, yet because of her
type of a voice, she was also

suited to more comic numbers—
most successfully “Penn Shera-
ton.”

The most consistent parts of

ous, with the “Department Store”
sequence standing out as most
funny. This was an interview
scene in which a frustrated store
detective begs the announcer to
steal something s: that he can
arrest him and jump on him, and
a 103-year-old shoplifter tells
about her hardships while mak-
ing a living.

The entire company also pre-
sents very short skits which add
to the quality of the evening. The
most memorable in this sequence
is the one which takes place in
an elementary ‘school. One by
one, the three children ask to be
excused so that they can sneak
into the bathroom. There, in their

‘unlegislated solitude, they freely
recite “The Lord's Prayer.”

It all makes for a very enter-
taining evening, especially if one
is in the mood for dining out.

Hogan, who as of Thursday
had never met‘ the man he will
serve with, voiced tainted op-
timism, “The differences of the
two parties are not one of goals,
but of means by which the goals
must be attained. I will never
endorse militant measures. We
must respect the administration.
Among other things, they control
the budget. We must deal with
them realistically and asure them
that we are not going off the deep
end.”

Like Engles, Hogan was not
sure Stern could deal with the
administration. “Maybe I'll have
to deal with them and Eric will
have to sit in the office. “But,”
Hogan added in connection with
rumors that he might resign, “I
will do all I can to help Eric
short of militant measures. I’ve
been in the Senate for two years
and don't intend to quit now.”

Engles also expressed some con-
cem about his ability to work
with Stern in the president-sena-
tor relationship. He said, “Al-
though there are acknowledged

differences between us and per-.

-‘haps some personal animosity, I

think once he assumes the office
and the responsibility which goes
with it, he will realize,” and then
came a long pause, “that the
goals that both of us seek are
the same, we will be able to
reach an accord.” .

Harvey Lefton, the victim of
Stern's surprise win, wished
luck in his new job. “This is what
the students wanted,” he said. I
hope he lives up to all of his
promises."

Lefton also was worried about
Stem’s dealings with the admin-
istration. “I just hope he takes
a. positive approach, although I’m
not really sure he will.”

Lefton said, “A lot of people
were surprised with the election,
myself included, Some one told
me that he felt this way about
Stern being elected. ‘It was like
a man who was not a soldier be-
ing made general of the Army.”
Lefton was referring to Stem’s
lack of ‘experience in student
affairs.

All three party leaders prom-
ised that the Able Party would
not die. “We will continue to
work to see that our espoused
goals are upheld,” Engles said.

Allocations

(Continued from Page 1)

“ *‘ ganization rather than the mon-

ey it was appropriated.

The student and general aﬁairs
allocation on the University’s op-
erating budget is $1,225,800. This
money covers salaries of advi-
sors, supplies, and other main-
tenance costs, not only student

_ A activities.

The allocation for Student Gov-
ernment decreased from appro-
ximately $6,000 to $4,000, main-
ly because the money was ap-
propriated for other sources, ac-
cording to Dr. Rankin. “Student
Government appropriated some
of this money to these other
groups as soon as they received
their budget.” For example, the
Men’s Dormitory now directly re-
ceives $1,400. In the past, they
received nothing. The money for
special projects allocated for such
activities as Winter Weekend and
the Percival Hunt Award,

Some of the other money in
the student and general affairs
budget goes for such things as
the Health Service‘ and Nurses
Residence, the General Student
Health Service, Placement Serv-
ice, Counselling Service, chap-
lains, Admissions, Student Aid,
and the Student Union. These de-
partments utilize approximately

‘ $376,000 of the budget, Dr. Rank-

in said.

Should the Activities Fee be in-
troduced. student activities would
receive approximately $50,000
Per yearinore, according to Dr.
Rankin. “There is no thought of

Vietnam “Democracy”

(First in a. series of three articles)

The war in Viet Nam in the past few
weeks, in the jargon of the military, has
escalated. Viet Nam is a very emotional
issue. War always is. We, however, as citi-
zens capable of influencing the decisions of
our government must think about Viet Nam
in an unemotional way. A rational reassess-
ment of our foreign policy in South Viet
Nam, therefore, should
be helpful.

Our thinking in Viet
Nam has been fuzzy. In
a series of articles, I
will discuss and evalu-
ate our policy. Where
I discuss facts that are
not widely known, I
will provide documenta-
’ tion. This first article
deals primarily with
the false notion that we
are fighting to defend

GARFINKEL freedom and democracy
in Viet Nam. Following articles show how
our present involvement in Viet Nam is
not only based on false as umptions, but is
detrimental to our nationa interest. Final-
1y I will argue that the best thing we could

 

do now is to withdraw under circumstances '

that involve the minimum loss of prestige.
First we must disabuse ourselves of the
pernicious and false notion that we are
ﬁghting at the request of an independent
South ‘Vietnamese government to defend
their freedom. In the Geneva agreement
. of 1954 that ended t-he French Indo-Chinese
War it was agreed that free national elec-
tions would be held in 1956 in both North
and South Viet Nam in order to unify the
country. South Viet Nam with the support
of the U.S. refused to participate In ‘W989
elections. (See the New York Times Maga-
zine Jan. 17 article by Sen. Wayne Morse,
p. 15) The reason was simple. We knew
we'd lose. ~Ho Chi Minh, the Communist
leader of North Viet Nam, was the leader
of the revolution t-hat overthrew French
rule. He was a nationalist hero.

SOUTH VIET NAM has never had free

 

., By 17"” Ga7'fl11k€l

democratic elections. First we supported
the old French puppet, Bao Dai. Then we
helped create a puppet regime of our own
under the late President Diem. By Nov. 1,
1963, Diem proved to be dissatisfactory and
was displaced by a military junta with the
support of our CIA. Since then there have
been so many military coups, civilian gov-
ernments, and counter coups that it’s al-
most impossible to keep count. Some of
the coups resulted from our CIA’s plans,
others got our blessing, and still others we
frowned on. None of these governments-
could be termed -free tr democratic except
by distorting the meaning of the terms.

One recent incident revealed the true
relationship between South Viet Nam and
the United States. Our ambassador, Gen-
eral’ Maxwell Taylor, tried to reverse one
of the more recent coups. General Khanh,
his former friend, was understandably an-
gered since he had engineered and led the
coup. K'hanh encouraged demonstrations
calling for the replacement of Ambassador
Taylor. President Johnson stated at a news
conference that Taylor was his man and
would remain in Viet Nam.

An ambassador is theoretically a guest
of an independent foreign country. If South
Viet Nam were really an independent coun-
try, President Johnson would not be able to
tell their government that their guest will
stay because he says so. President John-
son could say this and the South Viet Nam
government could do nothing about it be-
cause South Viet Nam is a creation and
dependent of the United States.

WE CANNOT be defending freedom or
democracy in Viet Nam because South Viet
Nam is neither free nor democratic. To
discuss Viet Nam in such terms is to cloud
the issue. And nuclear thinking about for-
eign policy is a disservice to our country.

If we are not in Viet Nam to defend the
freedom of the South Vietnamese, then we
must be there for one of two reasons: either
our prestige or our national interest is at
stake. In my next article I will discuss the

relationship of our prestige and national‘

interest to our current Viet Nam policy.

Able Party
Says ‘Produce’

Editor, The Pitt News:

The campaign is over; the Able
Party has ben defeated, and Eric
Stern and the PPP got the sweep-
ing mandate they desired. Con-
sidering the massive turnout and
the strict party voting, one can
only conclude that the Pitt stu-
dent"has, ﬁnally come out for a
cause.

He was told that Student Gov-
ernment for the past three years

J has been ineffective and that .a

vote for Eric Stern and the PPP
would bring about radical changes
-— a cooperative bookstore, re-

, vamping of the Advising Center,
a discarding of the 80's and 180's
requirements for distribution, re-
duced transportation rates for
commuters, and total student con-
trol over the activities fee to
name a few.

Eric Stern and the PPP, these
are your promises, now let us
see action! Don’t make fools out
of the people who put their faith
in you. Produce!

Himes’ Letter

Amuses Student
Editor, The Pitt News:

I was quite amused by the
caricature of candidate Eric

‘Stern gas it appeared in Mr.

 

  

Himes’ letter of Feb. 24 in The
Pitt News. But permit me to add
that the arguments presented by
this Tower resident convinced me
that Mr. Stern is by far the bet-
ter candidate for Student Gov-
ernment President.

Surely, if Mr, Stern, as alleged,
represents “one more. case of un-
rest among the misﬁts in the uni-
versity climate,” should we not
all the more appreciate his bold
endeavour to expose the in-
equities that existin the academ-
ic community and to offer speciﬁc
proposals for eradicating them?
The suggestions presented are
obviously arbitrary and, some-
times, erratic and mischievously
provocative; but this is inevit-
able when a candidate for pol-
itical oﬁice seeks in his platform
to arouse public attention and to
attract voters. This is precisely
what Mr. Stern has done. Mr.
Himes thus appears to be quite
naive and lacking in the ability
to apprehend this subtle distinc-
tion. ‘

However, my principal com-
Plaint against the Himes out-
burst is his rare ability to dis-
tort facts by maliciously refus-
ing to elaborate on certain alle-
gations. I refer, of course, to his
statement that the National Stu-
dent Association “has acquired a
questionable reputation through
some of its activities and pro-
posals.” Perhaps Himes will be
delighted to agree with certain
critics, that the American Civil

»- -.. ...—;s..

 

Union, CORE,
NAACP, etc. have also acquired
“questionable” reputations on ac-
count of their various activities.
It may be of interest to indi-
cate to Mr. Himes that his objec-
tion to the NSA establishes him
as a welcome bedfellow of the
State legislators of the Deep
South who have never ceased to
brand the ‘NSA as a Communist-
inﬁltrated group, worthy of being
linked with the organizations I
mentioned above,

I do not question the charge
that some of the NSA policies
and proposals are “unrealistic,”
as cited by Himes. This criticism
contains nothing original about
it; one has only to attend the
deliberations of the armual con-
gress of the NSA to hear this
allegations repeated. However, I
doubt whether any member col-
lege or university has withdrawn
from NSA merely because of un-
realistic policies of that organi-
zation. It is my experience that
the decision to secede is based
upon more substantial grounds;
for example, pressures from the
Administration, or from the State
legislatures.

Finally, Mr. Himes, the context
of your reference to “Orthodox"
seems to me to be in extremely
bad taste.

Hoopsters Lose Narrow
Decision to Penn State

-In Last Home Game

By JAI ROSENSTEIN
Larry Szykowny hit for a 3-point play with 3:59 left
in the basketball game. Penn State called for a time-out,
leading 65-64. When the Lions put the ball in play, Carver
Clinton shot and missed. The Panthers grabbed the re-
bound and had the chance to take the lead for the ﬁrst time

in the game.

Szykowny brought the ball up-
court. For a change, Panther
fans were in‘ an uproar. The
hoopsters worked the ball to Bob
Lovett in the corner. Daryle
Ruby cut under the basket to-

wards Lovett, but Lovette threw ‘

the ball out of bounds and the
Panthers lost their chance.

“That was the key play,” said
coach Bob Timmons, “If we had
been able to take the shot, at
least we would have had the
chance to score.”

Penn State won by 11, 83-72.
but the spread was not indica-
tive of the closeness of the game
because another offensive mis-
take prevented the Panthers from
applying some pressure in the

last minute of play. With 52 sec- *

onds showing on the Field House
clock, the hoopsters had the ball
and Penn State had a 74-70 edge.

Brian Fisher rolled the basket-
ball to Szykowny in order to save
time. But the Lions’ Jim Reed
alertly scooped up the ball and
layed it in with Fisher on his
back, The three point play made

, the score 77-'70.

Then Penn State took advan-
tage of the Panthers’ deliberate
fouling strategy to get the ball
by sinking four foul shots to
clinch the victory.

Szykowny and. Fisher ball-
hawked throughout the second
half. “They've given us eight
straight games of good defense,”
said Timmons. “They were tired
too, because we had to hustle
constantly to get back in the
game.”

Penn State held a 47-40 lead at
the half. Only Ruby's 20 point
effort kept the Panthers close be-
cause the Lions hit for a .731

percentage from the ﬂoor. They
made their ﬁrst seven shots and
13 out of their ﬁrst 14 ﬁeld goal
attempts were good.

In his last home game, Ruby
paced the Panthers with 26 points.
Jim Reed scored 26 to lead Penn
State. Carver Clinton contributed
19 points and grabbed 18 re-
bounds.

Timmons assessed the
Penn State team by saying that
“they shoot very well; they get
downcourt very fast once they
get the ball, and their rebound-
ing is more than adequate, They'll
do all right against the Ivy
League champion in the ﬁrst
round of the NCAA.”

As for the 6-15 Panthers, Lion
coach John Egli said that “they
played well enough to win and
they deserved to win.” The hoop-
sters have two away games re-
maining on their schedule.

Cubs Beat Steubenville to Bring
Season’s Mark to a Dismal 4-12

The freshman basketball team closed out its season
Saturday afternoon at the Field House with a 75-66 win
over Steubenville. The victory brought the Cubs’ ﬁnal won-

lost record to 4-12.

The frosh played the ﬁrst half like the Boston Celtics.
Leading 17-15, they didn’t miss a shot, scoring 12 straight
points. Bob Thompson, Frank Famularo, and Ken Bollens
sparked the surge that enabled the Cubs to go to the locker

room with a 37-28 edge.

Steubenville, however, tied the
score at 40 all with 15:50 to go
in the game. The Cubs had turn-
ed cold after the intermission.
“We weren’t rebounding and con-
sequently we were giving them
more than one shot at the basket
while we only had one,” said
coach Carl Peterson,

With 7:00 left, Steubenville led,
61,-54. Then the Cubs began click-
ing again. An eight to one spurt
tied the score at 62-62, Then
two foul shots by Famularo and

, two driving layups by Bollens put

the game in-the victoiy column.

The Cubs won the game on
the foul line as 137 out ‘of their
last 17 points were scored by

Heniff Loses on Reversal;
Mil<e]ol1nson Pins Opponent

By BILL CABIN

Tom Heniff lost his 123-pound match in the last seven seconds Saturday at Penn
Stateas the wrestlers lost their ﬁnal meet, 15-14. “Heniff’s match was i ,” said Coach
‘Rex Peery, reviewing his last dual_meet as a coach.

“Heniff reversed (Jay) Windfelder and went ahead with seven seconds left,” said
Peery. “Both boys were about even on riding time, and Heniff would have won except for

those last seven seconds.” Windfelde

Heniﬁ just as the buzzer sound-
ed ending the match. “The ref
called it as the buzzer blew,” said
Peery in disgust,

Tom Baily also had a disap-
pointing day as his ﬁve meet
winning string was broken by
sophomore Jerry Seaman. “He
beat Baily pretty soundly,” said
Peery, commenting on Seaman’s
9-0 win. Baily now has a 5-5 sea-
son record, while Seaman re-
mains undefeated as a 157-pound-
er.

The match was Peery’s last
dual meet as wrestling coach
here. His resignation as coach
becomes eﬂective after the NCAA
tournament March 25-27 at the
University of Wyoming.

“It was a heck of a meet to
end your career with,” said

_ Peery. “It was close and sever.a1

of our boys gave exceptional per-
formances despite the loss.”-

One of the most pleasing
matches for Peery was. Mike
Johnson’s defeat of Penn State’s
co-captain Steve Erber. Johnson
had not been in good enough
condition to wrestle the last two
weeks, but handily pinned Erber
at 2:01 of the ﬁrst period, The
pin was Johnson’s ﬁrst of the
season, giving him a 5-1 record.

“He’ll be ready for the East-
erns,” said Peery, “and he’ll have
a good seeding.” Johnson de-
fends his 130-pound Eastern title
at Cornell March 12-13, his top
challenger being Lehigh’s un-
defeated sophomore Joe Peritore.

  
   

MIKE JOHNSON
Retwms to Action

“(C1ail‘) Riley did a terriﬁc
job,” said Peery. “(Marty) Stray-
er just held on, and I thought
Riley could have got some points
for Strayer’s stalling.” Strayer is
the current 167-pound Eastern
champ, but was unimpressive

_ against Riley.

Riley has been frustrated all
season, compiling a 1-5-1 record.
He had been converted from a
lightweight to the 167-pound spot
this season, because of the team’s
shortage of wrestlers. He gave
away at least ten pounds tohis
opponent in each match, but
hopes to return to a lower weight
next year.

the second consecutive week.
Traunsteiner weighed in at 157

State’s Ellery Seitz, “Traunstein-
er very nearly got him,” said
Peery. "‘It was funny to see a
191-pounder backing-off from a
man 30 pounds lighter.”

Frank O’Korn and Dino Boni
came back from their defeats at
Lehigh to score wins against
State’s Glenn Theil and Joe Eres-
mus, respectively. O’Korn now
has a 8-2 record, while Boni is
6-2-1.

ymnasts Meet Ga. Tech

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

PHILADELPHIA —
Georgia T'ech travels to
Pittsburgh today to meet
the Panther gymnastics team at
Fitzgerald Field House at 2 p.m.
The gymnastics team, now 4-5
after Saturday’s 71.5-50.5 loss to
Temple, can have its ﬁrst .500
season in ﬁve years if it can top
Tech.

“Judges who have seen both
teams say we should win this
one,” coach Warren Neiger said.
“But you can never really tell.

They probably have some real
good boys."

Temple University had some
real good boys on their team,
also. Or at least, if not real good,
still better than Pitt. The Pan-
thers never led in the meet play-

Big Ten rivals Michigan State and Wis-
consin beat the swimming team 82-2-1 and
77-27, in a tri-dual meet Saturday at the

East Lansing pool. The double loss gave
the swimmers their worst season (1-8)
since the 1-8 record compiled by the 1955-56

squad.

With all three teams competing simultaneously,
seniors Ed &oleman and Frank Reed had the best

We represent a century
old life insurance company
with a solid reputation.
Ndt stodgy, though. The
Company's growth pattern
in the last ten years is a
reflection of keeping up-
to-date with the newest
coverages and features-
with competitive rates.

The sales force speaks
quality, too. They’re well-
informed in the profes-
sional approach to life
insurance programming.
Many of them began their
sales careers on college
and university campuses
in the Company’s intern-
ship program for students.

If you like the idea of a
quality company. a quality
training program, and
quality produc_ts—and if
you think you’d be inter-
ested in looking into a
career before graduation
—get in touch.
