ed slated, and elected candidates,
and improper overall procedure.
Regarding party irresponsibil-
ity, the committee stated that
many bills in the past have been
left unpaid. To eliminate the
election of uninterested officers,
the committee proposed an ex-

planation of duties, responsibili- .

ties and QPA qualiﬁcations.

“Consideration will _be given at
today’s meeting to straight party
elections and year-round political
partyorganization. Other proced-
ure changes concern the election
itself; thosewishing to vote will
be required to present their ID

cards at the polling desk and have,

hopes that this will eliminate
those who have previously voted

VIP Leaves

Coalition of
Last Year

By AL DONALDSON
Three leaders of the Veter-
ans-Independents Party told
members of last year’s Pitt!
Party that they Wished a«
“separate identity from any
fraternity group” during an
informal meeting last week
at the Kappa Nu house.

Last year, the VIPs and the Pitt
Party, which wa_s comprised most-.
ly‘ of small fraternities, engaged
in a coalition which defeated the
Panther Party during the Student
Council and Men’s Council elec-
tions.

Separate Identity Needed

Joe Banik, president of the Pitt
Independent Association, informed
the group that the‘ Independents
wished to “form an independent
movement which would~have a
separate identity ‘from ‘any other
group" but that -they would “slate
some fraternity men if necessary.”
Danny O’Connell, Engr._’58, and
John Lomond, Bus. Ad. ’56, backed
him up. ,

Banik also informed the group

that if the All-Pitt Party——the

Party—would incorporate “Inde-

The four basicareas which com-
prise the “core” program are: ( 1)
written a n d spoken English-in-
struction and practice in writing,
speaking, reading and listening;
(2) the humanities—the ﬁrst steps
toward an understanding of the
nature andlachievements of man
as revealed in his language, litera-
ture, philosophy, religion, music
and ﬁne: arts; (3) the social‘ sci-.
-ences——a study of man’s social in-
stitutions based on materials from
history, government, economics,
sociology, and geography and (4)
the natural sciences——an introduc-
tion to scientiﬁc principles and the
methods of scientiﬁc inquiry, using
materials fromastronomy, biologi-
cal sciences, biophysics, chemistry,
geology, physics, psychology, and
mathematics. .

Given to 85 Students.

This year, the courses in the
programare being given to a group
of 85 students who were selected
from a cross’ section of the Sep-
'tember freshman class. These stu-
dents, who are receiving one half
tuition for all “core” courses they
are taking, must take at least two
courses offered in the program but
no more than three. Next year,
the courses will become part of
the regular college curricula, with

dents who elect to take them.

grown to become an organization,
covering 700 colleges in the United
States with a membership of 300,-

' 000 students.

“Cardinal Newman was chosen
as the patron of the club,” Al Boll

Six Sections Ready  
In Each Basic Field

4 By GORDON CLOWNEY a

Core curriculum courses will be offered to college stu-
dents of all classes on an elective basis during the 1956-57-
school year. The “core” program, which was tried experi-
mentally this year, has proven successful. '

In’ an interview withvDr. Putnam F. Jones, associate dean
of the College and director of the core curriculum program,
it was learned that the number of sections in each of the four "
basic ﬁelds will be increased fromtwo to no fewer thansix,

These same students will be re-
tested again towards the latter part
of this semestsr to determine how
much, if any, the students entered

in the “core” program, improved ,

over that of their fellow students
who were not exposed to this type
of learning. ‘

of this evaluation test will _be '

Handiwork Shows
J aw Development,

. Structure of Teeth

By SALLY NELSON

Years from now, anguished
patients, sitting in a dentist’s
chair, may not realize the
hidden talent of “the man
with the drill”——provided he
is a graduate of Pitt’s dental
school. This talent is sculptur-
mg.

The value of this visual educa-
tion is two—fold—the students de-
velop dexterity; and they study
the development and construction
of the teeth and jaw from the
embryonic stage to maturity.

This sculpturing procedure‘ is
consistent, throughout all phases
of the study. After a lecture, slides
relative to the lecture are distrib-
uted. Then, observing the slide, the
student begins his “art work.”

He molds the section seen on

the slide in clay. The model may
be done either in oil clay or
ceramic clay. The ceramic clay
model can be painted, ﬁred,
glazed, and re-ﬁred; for this rea-
son ceramic clay is preferred.

- As far as it is known, the Uni— -

versity of Pittsburgh Dental
School was the ﬁrst to employ
clay in a dental laboratory.

This new concept, accredited to
Miss Elenore Reed, associate pro-
fessor of histology and embry-
ology, School of Dentistry, was
used for the ﬁrst time only a" few

years ago.

‘ The students sometimes branch
out on the artistic angle of their
education by carrying on their
own special projects.

For instance, in the ofﬁce of
Mr. Wm. F. Swanson, dean of the
School of Dentistry, and professor
of histology and bacteriology,
there are four charcoal proﬁle-
drawings. These drawings depict
the development of the jawline at

Men’s Council Hits Vacancies
With Constitution Change

By AL DONALSON
'Men’s Council representatives amended the section of
their Constitutionwhich deals with vacancies during a rou-
tine meeting last Wednesday afternoon. The amendment,
which was advanced by the Executive Committee‘, reads: “No
vacancies to Council membership will be ﬁlled after Dec.

1 for. that school year.’’ ,
Dimitri Petro, president of MC,
stated that the new amendment
willhelp insure a “well—knit -or-
ganization” since the clause will
prevent “uniformed members
from coming into Council late in
the school year.” The Constitution
previously had no deadline for
accepting representatives to ﬁll
vacancies. ‘
In other business for the day,
Thursday, April 19 was tenta-
tively set as the date of the
annual_ Men’s Council Banquet,
but since Council couldn’t agree
whether the affair should be
stag or date, they referred the
matter back to Social Committee
Chairman Ron Sobel for his con-
sideration. _

Council also gave ‘a unanimous
vote of approval to Joe Anania,
Bus. Ad. ’56, who is working on
a class ring project along with
the Men’s Class Officers Commit-
tee. Anania claims that the pres-
ent class ring system is “helter-
skelter” and that the’ class rings

are “entirely too expensive.”
Anania feels that if a" number
of jewelers, are asked to bid for
the Pitt business, it" would result
in a lower cost for students and
a possibility that more seniors
would buy rings. According to
Anania, the Committee will also
work to have the jeweler have a
representative on campus for the
convenience of students. A

“grow up” undergraduates; the prospect of students willing
to do their own work should encourage professors to boost
the academic level of their classes.

, _- However,’ any such program must be considered method-
ically by faculty, administration, _ and students before‘ it_ is
introduced to any legislative body, be it the University
Senate or Student Congress. It requires directed planning
by persons who have investigated such programs already
in effect throughout the United States.

_We feel that the Council of Scholastic Organizations

president, Joe Montuoro, did the right thing to approach_

.l job of SC to consider such an important matter. .

I But we question both Bob Sedler’s -sincerity and his
judgrnent in bringing the proposal to SC, posthaste. It is
the ﬁrst measure this year that he has pushed along with

any degree of speed——unfortunately, it should be thought out
carefully and slowly. ' ‘ '

 Certainly Sedler is enough of a parliamentarian to

5 'know that such a bill’ should hardly be presented without
having ﬁrst been considered by such a standing committee
as the faculty—student ‘relations committee, for example.
‘ However, Sedler told the Pitt News-Editor Thursday

that no committee in Congress is big enough to handle the

, problem-—-reason— one why he’-s presenting it to the whole
S’ body; and, reason two, that particular committee is not em-
powered to handle the situation. Only discussions and teas?
Withstudent elections less than a month away,-we can
see some motive for Sedler presenting such a major issue—--
it is the ﬁrst one of considerable merit SC will‘ have dis-
cussed all year duringhis administration. '

Awkward Disunity

from a myriad oiactivities and other councils are

Where are the Class officers? They pick up loose '

dances. Once in the while they sponsor dances for
other classes in the school. Rarely do they keep
within themselves, but, often, encompass the re-
sponsibilities of SC.

Alas, meandering SC members further confused
the program, last year, when they turned.the Christ-

In October of 1943, Glenn Mil-'
lerreceived his commission as a
captain in the Army Air Force.
A few months later in March of
1944, he began ‘organizing the
great Glenn Miller Army Air
Force Ban_d at ,Yale University
in New Haven, Conn.

By Juneof 1943, the big band
was an actuality and on the ﬁfth
of that month it began ’a‘ very
popular series of radio broadcasts
called I Sustain The Wings.
These broadcasts lasted for near-
ly a year over NBC, and featured
the full forty-ﬁve piece orches-
tra.

In less than one year after be-
ing shipped overseas to England
the band engaged in over eight
hundred musical activities, and
hundred were
broadcasts; in addition, it en-
gaged in over three hundred per-
sonal appearances playing to a
gross ‘attendance of over six hun-
dred thousand. Just as an ex-
ample, on Aug. 14 it played for
ten thousand officers and enlist-
ed men, and then on the follow-
ing day it gave two more con-
certs before an additional seven-
teen thousand. servicemen.

I, for one, feel they aretaking
a step in the right direction. Of
course, it must be pointed out

that as the program operated in

, the past, freshmen in one school
had the opportunity to realize‘
1 that the grass was not always

greener on the other side; they
were able to see that every school
has its individual problems,
heavy homework assignments,
and difficult courses.

- This way, counselors in one

school will not need to counsel-

specialized problems about which
they know little or nothing.

Students should be better able
to understand one another. Eng-

' to sit quiet and befuddled when

some of the engineers in the class
begin to discuss the difficulties

they are running into in technical A

terms. '

One section of the conference,

for example, deals with proper ‘

study habits. Now it is expected-

that the instructors ‘and coun-

program are all capable indi-

cannot be expected to be au-

to discuss with their students in
the past.

The change will bebetter all

medley relay in 2:58 to set a new Naval Academy record‘.

Jim Zurcher and Warne White

Troubles   Raised
On IM Basketball

By ED BACHMAN
News Editor

 

,(Editor’s Note: This is the first of a series of two col-
umns discussing intramural athletic problems at Pitt.)

,Varsity sports are very important in college life. ‘They
increase spirit of the students and alumni and add prestige to

 ,_,.~t,l,1',e school. All this is granted. But another form of sports
 ‘which is also important is intramural athletics.

Yearly, there are vnll over 1000 fraternity and non-fra-
ternity men competing in the various intramural and inter.-
fraternity leagues of seasonal sports.

Many" questionable practices have occurred recently, in
the operation of the IM and IF leagues, and an attempt was
made last week to ﬁnd out the answers to these questions

_ from the man who should know—Leo C. Bemis, Director of

 , Intramural Activities. -

 

;_;.,_

   

 

. 7’

.11--.

To many, "the seemingly lackadaisical method of ,.deter-
"mining playoff teams has been inadequate. But much is in-
volved in this controversy. Take the present big sport, bas-
ketball, for example.

There are a total of 54 teams in IM and IF leagues. Most

wofthese team_s are forced to play their scheduled games at

restricted days and hours. Complications have ‘developed,
particularly in the IF leagues. Many’ postponements have
dragged the schedule out; last week, it was necessary to
change the pre-arranged six-team playoff system to eight

{teams to determine the trophy winners more easily. A six-
 team playoff would have forced many byes and an’ extra

round of play—and' the»basketball season is getting danger-
ously close to the IF volleyball season.

There has_ been a bit of moaning -Fabout the fact that

, Leagues A and B are permitted three teams in the playoffs,

while League- C ﬁnds only two ‘of their squads allowed to

compete for the three trophies“ This is explained in the fact

that the basketball leagues, as are all IF leagues, are set up

in accordance with the previous year’s record. The stronger ~

2 teams, in the respective sport, be it basketball, football, etc.,
are put -in League A, and so on down theline. Thus the
leagues are more evenlybalanced, and better games result.
3 The IM leagues, too, have had their troubles in- this play-

' .,  problem. Many teams have suddenly wakened up to ﬁnd

out they are not-at top of their respective basketball league.
But instead, they ﬁnd that a league game, or games, which
they ‘supposedly won previously, have been stricken from
their records. Quite naturally this demands an explanation.

Bemis gives as a reason for this procedure the fact that
many teams in the fall semester drop out of their basketball
leagues, Since that eliminates a chance for these withdraw-
als'to play all, teams in their league, ,Bemis,has felt that
"the only fair thing is to strike their records, rather than for-
feit games. I V ‘ . S - ’ g -
,  It is suggested that a more stern measure be taken ‘with
teams which withdraw. In order. to keep a proper balance in
a league, and give .the champion a more honest claim to its
title, why not require each team to post a bond before the sea-

’ son opens which would be forfeited if they withdraw from

play? This sounds like a stern measure, but it would insure a
permanent league, with continuing competition. _

‘ Much of the above-mentioned controversy could, it seems,
be eliminated if strict organization he set up beforethe season

3 - _opens. Set rules, stick to them, and be sure the competing

teams and leagues understand the rules.

Position In IF

» Third place Sigma Chi turned
the tables on the second place Phi
Delts to the tune of 76-33 at the
Stadium on Thursday night, Feb.
23, and threw the League A race
into a real battle.

Sigma Chi led all the way and
was paced by Paul Grifﬁth’s ﬁne
all-around play. He ended up the
evening with 23 points. Four other
players ﬁnished in the double scor-
ing ﬁgures and that told the tale.’

The Phi Delts, never in conten-
tion,--were paced by the high scor-
ing center Jim Trebac, who had
19 of their 33 points before fouling
out late in the game.

Alpha Phi Alpha came on with
a surge in the closing minutes to
take a 32-29 victory out of the
grasps of Sigma Pi, and continue
to be the,leaders of the C League.

The game was a nip and tuck
affair all the way with the lead
see-sawing until th: ﬁnal minutes
when Joe Baber and Clarence
Burleigh of the victors poured the
points through to clinch the vic-
tory._ i

In the scoring department, Ba-
ber had 13 _and Burleigh, seven
for the winners, and Allen -and
Kumer ﬁnished_with l0 and six
respectively forlthe losers. '

Sigma Pi went into a despera-
tion all-court ‘press. in the ﬁnal
minute in an attempt to get the
ball and the game, but Alpha Phi
Alpha got control of the ball and
went into a semi-freeze that lasted
throughout the closing minutes.

HUSBANDS, ANYONE?

It -has been alleged that coeds go to college-for the sole purpose
of ﬁnding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous canard, and
I give fair warningthat small and spongy as I am, anybody who
ever says such a dastardly thing when I am around had better
be prepared for a sound hiding! ' ' 1

Girls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do:'
to broaden their horizons,-to lengthen their vistas, to drink at the
fount of wisdom, to ‘trail their ﬁngers in the main currents of '
American thought. But if, by chance, _while a girl is engaged in
these lofty pursuits, a likely looking husband should pop into
view, why, what’s wrong with that? Eh? What’s wrong with
that? ’ ' I

The question now arises, what’ should a girl look for in a hus-
band? A great deal has been written on’ this subject. Some say
character" is most impo_rtant, some say background, some say
appearance, some say education. All are wrong.

The most important thing — bar none — in a husband is health.
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Captain
McCutchen, what good is he if he ‘just lays around $11 day
accumulating bcdsores? '

that he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to" "
beguile you with,his wit and charm, slap a thermometer in his '
mouth, roll back his eyelids, yank out his tongue, palpate his
thorax, rap his patella, ask him to straighten out a horseshoe

’ with his teeth. If. he fails to pass these few basic tests, iphone ’
for an ambulance and go on to the next prospect.

. If, however, he turns out to be physically ﬁt, proceed to the .
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to,a
sense‘ of humor. _ ~ -

‘ A man who can’t take a joke is a manlto be shunned‘. There are‘
several simple tests to ﬁnd out whether your prospect can take
a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or burn his

hoops of steel, for you may besure that he is gentle as a summer
breeze, gentle as a mother's kiss, gentle to his very marrow.

And now, having found a man who is gentle and healthy and
blessed with asense of humor, only one thing remains: namely, ’
to make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That,

fortunately, is very simple. Just enroll him in Engineering.

Intelligence Level
Above Average In

Small Enrollment '

By GORDON CLOWNEY
(Second of a Series)

Falk Elementary School, an
experimental subdivision of
the University’s School of Ed-
ucation, provides a unique ex-
perience in learning for chil-
dren from nursery school age
through eighth grade.

The children_ at Falk School,
several of whom are sons and
daughters of Pitt faculty mem-
bers, have IQ’s ranging from 95
to 196, and, as a group, are con-
sidered to have above average
intelligence. . _

' With a total enrollment of only

225, it is possible for classes to be’

much smaller than regular pri-
mary school classes. At the Falk
School,l the average class size for
the upper grades is 25, while ‘for
the lower grades it is closer to
20. This makes for a much closer
student-teacher relationship _than
is -ordinarily possible.
Admitted by Application

Students are admitted by appli-

cation and arerequired to spend

three days at the school before"

their application is acted upon.

learning by doing is the prevail-
ing motto of Falk School.

Typing, and either_ Spanish or‘
French in addition to English, are
taught from kindergarten on. A
swimming program is also in ef-
fect which teaches the children
to swim at an early age.

After students have completed
their education through the eighth
grade level, approximately 75 per
cent of them go on to secondary
schools in and around the city,
while the remaining 25 per cent
attend private schools throughout
the East.

All business involving the Falk
School is handled by the Bursar’s
Office of the University. This in-
cludes ‘such things as the handling
of tuition money, which ranges
between 350 and 500 dollars a
year, and scholarships which are
awarded to deserving students.
The tuition money covers books,
supplies and other materials used
in classwork.

Lights Inadequate _
Past ESA president Ray I-lostler
stated -that classroom lights that
are planned to be “supplemented
by daylight are not fulﬁlling the
need for evening classes.” He said,
“only ‘one-third of the need" is
met. .
, Also, he believed breaks are
needed for long classes. Although
Ray Hostler said there is a need
for an ESA. room in the Schen-
ley Hotel, he said acquisition of
theballroom or another recrea-
tional room,_ upon request, for
social events, is more necessary.

Other student said classrooms
are too “stuffy and warm,” be-
coming too cold if windows are
opened. Some commented on poor
lighting on the upper ﬂoors. ’

Students living" near school said
more publicity should be posted
at the school entrance to announce
social events. Those living out-of-
town said “most students are more
interested in their daily work”
and activities than school events.

Lab Instructors Few
One student suggested the sci-
ence laboratories , institute more
instructors: “in one lab, there is
one instructor for over 60 students.
Most agreed that ‘if any ap-
preciable age difference exists
between students, this fact adds
to the interest in discussions. '
Several people interviewed re-
uested that the facilities of the
