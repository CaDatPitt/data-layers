New Program
Scheduled By
4,Blood Bank

The Blood Bank has announced
plans for a new program which
willneed the cooperation of Uni-
versity. students. In order to help
more people, the Bank has ex-
panded its program using 400
more pints of blood each week.
Students are being asked to help
offset this increase by giving a
pint of blood at their earliest con-
venience. M

Beginning Wednesday appoint-
menls should be made either in
pC:t':<nr1 in the basement of Fillli
Clinic or by phone at extension
. 602.
y “We would like to have a con-
"l trolled group," Dr. Maxwell, who
is in charge of the program, said.
“Advance appointments should
bemadc to eliminate unnecessary
lines and waiting. The entire
transaction from the time a stu-
dent cnters the building to the
time he leaves should take ap-
proximately 45 minutes. If ad-
vance appointments aren‘t made,
student‘s will have a lengthy
Wall..”

At the present time the Bank

. wants all types of blood. Stu-'

dents between the ages of 18 and
21 must have parental consent, be

married, or be ‘self-supporting.
“After the blood has been giv-
en," Dr. Maxwell said, “it can be
donated either to donor clubs such
as the hemoplielia, lukemia, or
even a family donor club; or the
student can receive the payment

of ten dollars for his services.’
Dr. Maxwell also expressed the
wish that the students would not
all come at one time. A steady
' flow would be preferable, since
only a certain amount can be ac-
,; commodated at one time. At pre-
sent the Bank has about 100
donors daily and would like 15
or 25 more a day. I

Thomas M. Cooley. dean of the
University’s School of Law, is be-
t“ Wing-; considered for twb positions
in the Kennedy Administration:
chairman of the Federal Commu-

Dr. Cooley said that neither job
has been offered to him yet, and
therefore, “I have no way of mak-
ing up my mind as to what to do
if either position were offered.”

 It is quite deﬁnite that Dean
Copley is being considered seri-
ously for these jobs, as several
of his friends are now being
questioned by the FBI.

“There is a possibility that I
will know more about the job in
the next ten days,” Cooley said.

Cousins Unalole
To Appear At
Midday Se1'ies

The Midday Series announced
today that Norman Cousins, editor
of the Saturday Review. will be
unable to appear on Jan. ll, 1961,
as scheduled. However, he plans
to be at the Midday Series pro-
gram of April 7, 1961.

Cousins has received an as-
signment from the State Depart-
ment to represent the United
States at an international meeting
"in India.

Cousins’ booking representative
said that his value to the stu-
dent body would be “considerably
increased, should he appear after
his return from India.

“Since all of his past official
journeys have been news-making
ones, there is no reason why this
one should not also be of national
interest."

As a result of Cousins’ change
of plans, the first program of the
Midday Series for this term will
feature. Dr. Walter Kaufmann,
noted author and Princeton phil-
Losopher, wholwill speak on Jan.

1961: YEAR OF DECISION

Well sir, here we are in 1961, which shows every sign of being
quite :3. distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since
1951 which begins and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when
it comes to Figure l’s, 1961, though distinguished, can hardly
compare with 1911, which, most people agree, had not just two,
but three Figure l’s! This, I'll wager, is a record that will stand
for at least two hundred years!

1911 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It

I was, for example, the year in which the New York Giants played

the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we all know,
the New York Giants have since moved to San Francisco and
the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is a movement
afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix—the cit: , not the
‘baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to
Chicago. It is felt that the change would be broadening for
residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks, for example, have
never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand,
have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal
shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have
to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great prob-
lem, what with modern scientiﬁc advances like electronics and
the French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will ﬁnd
that Lake Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes,
which in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which

I

\\.

      

. ‘ /' I /v I ,
fﬁezz WMXJIV 527/Z...
in turn is connected to the Atlantic Ocean. You start dragging
Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you’ll be dragging
all that other stuff too. This would make our British allies
terribly cross, and I’can’t'. say as I blame them. I mean, put
yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British
workingman who had been saving and scrimping all year for a
summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when you got to
Brighton Beach there wasn’t any ocean? There you’d be with your
inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day but dance the
Lambeth Walk. -This, you may be sure, would not make you
N ATO-minded I
I appeal most ea mostly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it’s no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I
ask you—Chicagoans, Phoenicians-is it too big a price to pay
for preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure that if
you search your hearts you will make the right decision, for
all of us—whether we live in frostbitten Chicago, iguana-ridden
Phoenix, or narrow-lapelled New I‘Iaven—-are first and foremost
Americans! 7
But I digress. We were speaking of 1961, our new year. And

new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure in Marlboro '

Cigarettes. How can there be new pleasure in Marlboros when
that ﬁne, ﬂavorful blend, that clean easy draw ﬁlter, have not
been altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a
Marlboro, it is like t-he ﬁrst time. The ﬂavor is such that age
cannot wither nor ‘custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never
jades, never dwindlcs into dull routine. Each pack, each
cigarette, each puﬁ, makes you glad all over again that you are
8. Marlboro smokerl '

So, Marlboros in hand, let us march conﬁdently into 1961.
May good fortune attend our ventures! May happiness reignl
May Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their disappoint-
ment and join our bright cavalcade into a brave tomorrowl

Dan Johnson Sets °

  

Political Ideas In
High School Class

By JIM NELSON
Looking for an unusual hob-
by? Start a political party-
Dan Johnson, Arts fresh-

. man, did.

This month the Vanguard
Party is celebrating its ﬁrst
year as a national political party,
according to co-chairman Dan
Johnson.

The party originated in a Prob-
lems on Democracy class in a

Uniontown High School. Dan, » I

working with Jeffery Axelred as
co-chairman, organized his poli-
tical ideas and placed together a
party platform.

Then they sent out letters to
cities all over the United States
asking for newspapers’ and voters’
opinions of the platform. The ma-
jority of people who responded
were in agreement with the plat-
form, with a few reserves. The
main opposition came from So-
cialist Youth groups, Segregation
leaders and Labor Unions.

The party has grown and now
has representatives in cities

throughout the country with its ‘

national office in Uniontown.

The party receives information
and press releases from congres-
sional committees, the state de-
partment, the CIA, and other pri-

' vate groups.

During the 1960 presidential
election campaign the Vanguard
Party received communications
from nationally recognized poli-

tical parties including a petition ,
for the support of the Vanguard '
Party from Vice—president Nixon. _

“We believe,” commented John-
son, “America must become the
dynamic leader for democracy and
must wrest initiative from th e
communists in all phases of world
political development.”

“The Vanguard Party,” Johnson
continued, “is an organization de-
dicated not to liberalism or con-

  

DAN JOHNSON started his own political party. His reason: “Amer-

~§

ica must become the dynamic leader for democracy . .  His party
is ﬁnishing one year of national recognition this month.

servatism, but to a combination of
the better parts of both.”

On current national bills. the
Vanguard Party takes the follow-
ing stands: favors the repeal of
the Connally Amendment; is
against Federal Health Insurance;
strongly favors the A,M.A. Plan:

distressed areas.

“The party motto is ‘Policies
Not Politics’,” Johnson comment-
ed.

“In 1961 we plan to start Van-
guard Student Organization chap-
ters at many colleges and hope to
start one at Pitt in the near fu-
ture,” Johnson concluded.

effect Stimotlr Yet

The mail-in-method of registration has eliminated the
«troublesome task of ﬁghting for class cards in the Commons
. Room, but it has not eliminated the battleﬁeld in the Of-
, ﬁce of Student Records.

A’ Students are changing their schedules for a variety of,
’ reasons: somehave time conflicts,_others have undesirable
courses, many do -not have the instructors they preferred,
,a few were just unlucky. ‘ V
During the registration. period last fall, administrators
V stressed that students‘ shouldexplain to advisors any ex-
. tenuating circumstances which would create a time con-
it llict.

 
   

 Information was also available then about -the subject
I matter in courses. Students were urged to familiarize them-
 selves with this material before electing a course, thus
' avoiding schedule changes during the first ~ week of this
term. Students who failed to follow these instructions are
. being charged a $5 fee for each change.

3 By excluding the instructor’s name from the course

“honor the students’ preference. According to the Oﬂice of
 Educational. Planning names were available before the
P booklet went to press, and could have beenincluded.

' The decision by administrators to exclude these names
it was not, unanimous. There were some who_ supported that
 ‘fundamental theory of educational institutions which gives
the student the right to select the instructor most capable
in his eyes. ‘

I ‘ ,Apparently_ equal distribution of students in classes
5 was considered more important than the best means for
a student to acquire knowledge;

A more subtle way of discouraging students from sign-
ing up_ for courses with the better instructors is ‘needed,
since eeliminéting instructors names from the course se-
lection booklet was a rather futile ‘attempt. In order to
overcome this small barrier to education many students
are paying the required fee to change a course. Some even
avoided this by checking with various departments during
registration.

 For the students who are victims of fate, only sym-
pathycan be offered. Post Olﬁces will always lose registra-
ioh kits, advisers will occasionally write the wrong course
number on a schedule form, and IBM operators will some-
times push the wrong button. - i

, If mistakes like this were made, the Office of Student
; Records will try to get the students the requested sched-
"tile. The student is required to present his registration copy
»;to.that oﬁice in order to facilitate any action.

Not to be overlooked’ is the brighter side of this term’s
=-registration. Advanced planning and a little luck has made

Goals‘ “Examined . -. .i 

Time for   Discussion

and two hour exams fragment the totality of the _«

,By Ina Amdur

Now that the trimester has been in operation
for the equivalent of two school years, it is time
that its success he discussed by those who are most
affected by it, in short, by the students.

The interesting point to notice about the stu-
dents’ reaction to the trimester is
that no one with any, authority
has paid attention to what they
have said, nor has anyone ever
granted any validity to. their
complaints. ‘ 

The over-all picture of the I"
trimester reveals one prevalent
philosophy which was stated,
though not in reference to the
trimester, by a speaker at the
American College _Public Relations Association:
“We have shared with industry the gloriﬁcation of
the executive and organization man and thus have
introduced into the educational system the values
of the market place.

“The plain truth of the matter is that adminis-
tration exists for the purpose of allowing the really
important people —- the faculty members and stu-
dents. — to get. their work done. The success of
any administration lies in the degree to which it in-
conspicuously provides the environment and facili-
ties within which instruction and research can ef-
fectively be carried on.” An examination of the
deﬁciencies‘ of the trimester will reveal that the
University now espouses- the same goals as the
..business world. Quantity, not quality, is the im-
plicit motto of the trimester system. ..
Subfrocl-ion Problem ' A

It has been reiterated by the administration that
the trimester is only one week shorter than the
regular semester._ Although, this is true theoreti-
cally, it is not true practically. Instead of the ﬁf-
teen week trimester, there is reallyia thirteen week

 

period of time. - -

All students realize that many professors begin
their ﬁnal examinations at, the beginning of the
second to the last week of school. The last two
weeks of ’ the ‘trimester are devoted ahnost entirely
,to the hurried completion of the required work,

. and little authentic studying is done. The student

who has six courses on_ the trimester system, and
who is expected to be prepared for final exams in
thirteen weeks, often wonders what the benefit of
the trimester treadmill is.

The farcical examination week only culminates
the larger farce of the trimester as a whole. It is
difficult to understand how final exams can be so
slighted in a university which should realize the’
invaluable educative aid which ﬁnal exams should,
be to thestudent. It should be a time of ‘assimila-
tion and thought, and a time when a total View of
the semester’s work should be grasped and articu-
lated. ‘ I ’ —

The new system of one hour“ exams, or in some
cases two hours on separate days, has inherent
weaknesses. One hour exams do not give the stu-
dent enough time to demonstrate what he knows,

. Letters to

 

 

 

material. A ﬁnal examination should be the one
time of the semester when the student cannot
blame his failure to organize on the lack of time.

Most universities of any stature administer’

three hour ﬁnal examinations. As it stands now.
our ﬁnal examination week with one hour exams,
and daily assignments to be ﬁlled, combined with
the required attendance of classes during the. exam
week, belongs in a high school, not in a university.
Although the administration is alwayspreaching
“totalityand the ‘whole man,” the student is never.
given the chance to demonstrate that he has any
total view of his courses. One could say that‘ not
many Pitt students care about a total view of any-
thing, but one must also admit that a university
must gear its curriculum to its best students. If it
does not do so, all the dormitories in the world will
not save it from stifling mediocrity. , ~

A Time for Everything

Certain University administrators who are truly ,

concerned about the goal of education, and who do
not treat their schools as miniature corporations,
have found that granting a reading period toward
the end of the semester is the best way to help
the student assimilate the knowledge that he has
gained. Any such plan, of course, on a “ﬁfteen
week” trimester would be patently impossible.
Even a one week reading period toward the end of
the trimester would be of great help ‘to the stu-
dents and to the faculty.
Wemust realize that leisure is only a pejorative
' word, when it connotes timethat is wasted. At the
University, in the past several years, most have not
shown any cognizance of the fact that some leisure

time is a pre-requisite for any meaningful educa--

ﬂtion. . True to our emulation of the business world,
weesay that time should be spent “doing” some-
thing. Thinking can be done on the streetcar in
the morning. _ ‘

Another interesting trimester change has been
the consolidation of many courses to one trimester.
The logic_ of this . change is hard to understand.
Courses that used to occupy two semesters,'. now
occupy one trimester.
all of our courses introductory. Many major uni-

, yersities offer two year required" coursesiin the
humanities or in contemporary civilization. Instead
of consolidating courses under the trimester,- why
not expand them? It is ﬁne to compete with Russia
for the “production” of college graduates, but when
competition ‘means the dehumanization of educa-
tion_and the talsiﬁcation of every respectable in-
tellectual standard, then perhaps we should exam-
.ine our goals more closely.

The University has failed to live up to its high
verbal promises of improved standards. The tri-
mester has not been carefully enough evaluated by
the administration, by the faculty, or by the stu-
dents. ‘ If some changes are not made to correct
the obvious deﬁciencies in the trimester, the Uni-
versity will surely assume the intellectual character
which is symbolized by its physical structure. It
will become a Tower of Babel, an institution sym-
bolizing intellectual incoherence and mental sloven-
liness, and a haven for those who wishito reach
the truth in two and two thirdsyears.

Editor Pitt News:

Three cheers for Chancellor
Litchﬁeld ! H ‘For a while I
thought the entire Fall trimes-
ter would pass without a word
about a tuition increase. But the

Commander-in-Chief ‘came

through with ﬂying colors. -It
does my heart good to know
that Dr. Litchﬁeld feels that it
is necessary, good, and just to
penalize those students who are
from out of state. ‘Instead of be-
ing slightly ;honored that stu-
dents pass by their own colleges
and universities to come here to
Pitt, the school sees fit to dis-
criminate against them in a way
that is most likely to be ob-
jectionable.

Perhaps the Chancellor thinks
the extra ﬁnancial burden of
coming from another part of the

I would like to see with my own

the Chancellor based his state-

REFEREE STANLY Mousetis awards two points to Panther Jim

Harrison, (on top) for a takedown in 177 pound clash.

Panthers Extend
Win Streak to 4,
Jinks Gets 25

By JIM O'BRIEN

In capturing their fourth
win in -a row, Coach Bob
Timmons’ Panthers gave in-
dication of a bright future as
they downed the Syracuse
Orange, 79-62.

Timmons singled out John Frid-
for his outstanding defensive
goalwork. Though Fridley didn’t
score much himself, he guarded
the nets against Pete Chudy, nor-
mally the Orangemen’s top scoring
threat, as if he had sealed the
hoop with a cork plug. Chudy
didn’t manage a single ﬁeld goal.

“I knew Syracuse was weak,”
Timmons remarked, “but I didn’t
think they were that bad. Fri-d-
ley did a good defensive job on
Chudy and some of the others
came through in good fashion."

Jinks Tops

Ben Jinks, the sensitive sopho—_
more who sulks when he plays
poorly, must have been highly
elated for his superb 25 point
performance.

Jinks was spurred on by a
personal cheering section of
front row urchins, who irritated
the sports writers with their
piercing partisan cries. They
even invaded the press box to
be closer to their he a, until
Publicity Director “Beano” Cook
threatened evacuation.

“We moved well against the
zone defense,” Timmons stated
“Ben’s our best shooter and we
had him floating. He was freed
quite often and he was hitting
very well.’’ Jinks sank nine ﬁeld
goals in his onslaught, the top
scoring effort for the Cats this
year.

, Starring Relief
Don Steinhart, who has been

disappointing since his starring
debut against Purdue, relieved
Paul Lazor, who ﬂunked his
starting assignment. The blank-
faced Carnegie senior ignited the
Panther drive which enhanced
the lead from 24-23 to 39-25 at in-
terrnission.

Steinhart registered six, of
nine ﬁeld goal atempts and sev-
en of eight charity shots for 19
points—-his season high. Bob
Sankey, junior reserve, also
looked more impressive in his
relief tenure. He added six
points to the Cat total.

Tom Maloney cut down his per-
sonal foul commitments to two,
and added 11 points in the PIO-
cess. Timmons’ men grabbed 50
rebounds in a good board domin-
ance display. Fridley handled 17
and Steinhart managed 12 grabs.

The Panthers substituted freely
with five minutes remaining, and
a 6-5‘record safely in the hoop

North Carolina State Requires

Final Event To Defeat M ermen

Snaps Back Stroke Record For Panthers

BEN 1 JINKS
Deadly Jump Shooter

By JOHN FLEDIING
North Carolina State de-
feated the Panthers, 54-41, in
the Cat’s ﬁrst swim meet of
the season. The defeat,‘ how-

!ever, encouraged the Pan-

thers, for prior to the meet
the Wolves of North ‘ Carolina
were rated as solid favorites to
swamp the Aquatic Panthers.

Although defeated, the mer-
men were not to be denied some
glory. Panther Jerry Sollinger
broke the school record in the
200-yard back stroke. So1linger’s
time of 2:19 knocked 3.2 seconds
off the old record set by “Skip”
Monsein in 1955.

The Wolves were not able to
claim victory until the final event
was over. A victory in the 400-
yard free style relay stole the
meet from the Panthers. “I was
very happy with the boys show-
ing,” said Coach Ben Grady. “I
didn‘t expect the meet to be as
close as it was.”

Letterman Bart Haas captured
first place in the 50-yard free
style but missed first place honors

tively. ‘

In winning the meet, North
Carolina State captured eight of
a possible eleven ﬁrst places but
the Panthers won a majority of
the second and third place points
to hold them in the competition.

Although it was the tankers.
season opener, it was the fourth
meet for the_ Wolfpack and it
was also their fourth victory.
“I expect this North Carolina
team to make a good showing‘
in rational competition,” com-
mented Coach Grady.

The mermen have a fairly well-
balanced squad with the only
weakness being in the sprint ev-
ents. “If we can develop a few
real fast sprinters, we will be
able to give any team a run for
their money,” said Coach Grady.

20-8 Win Over Cornell

By TED GOIJION

A crowd of more than 600 saw ﬁve of the nine Panther
wrestlers moved up a weight class Saturday against a strong

Cornell team as the Cats garnered a 20-8 decision in their
first dual match ofgthe year.

> Coach Rex Peery’s matmen who are ranked top in the
East, along with Penn State and Leihgh, had to hold their

9 to 6 decision from Cornell’s Al
Rose in the most exciting bout of
the afternoon.

Harrison Assures Victory

In the 177 pound clash be-
tween Harrison and Rose 11 of
the bout’s 15 points were scored
in the second period. Harrison
scored six on a combination of a
takedown, a reversal and two
escapes. Rosescored ﬁve. In the
third period Harrison scored three
to Rose’s one.

Harrison is the Panthers reg-
ular 157 pounder but had to be
moved up to 177 when Joe
Schmitt, Peery’s 167 man, suf-
fered a knee injury in practice
during the week. As a result
Harry Dick was inserted in the
123 pound class and Dick Mar-
tin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kel-
vingtoh, John Zolikoft‘ and Har-

rison all had to be moved up.

All but Dick achieved victory
with the 123 pound battle ending
in a draw.” I was surprised at the
showing of Dick,” said Peéry. “He
lost to that same fellow up at
Wilkes just a week ag-o and then
he goes out there and ties him
the next time they meet," Peery
concluded.

Take 14-2 Lead

The Panthers chalked up a 14-2
lead after Dick and Jared Bar-

Ray of Hope

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIII '

Two new additions to the Panther hoopsters have given local
‘ fans a ray of hope for the l’60-’61 season. Ben Jinks, a sophomore
from New York, and Tom’Maloney, a Pittsburgh junior, have sparked
the Panthers to their last four victories.

Both boys are colorful players ‘with good moves under the boards

and are accurate shooters.

Most of the New York students at Pitt have adopted Jinks as
their favorite son. Although he still has a lot to learn, especially
on defense, he could developed into one of the most outstanding

players since Don Hennon.

Jinks possesses a great jump shot, and when he drives he
twists and‘ turns and somehow gets his shot away. It usually

£005 ii).

On defense he can make a great play but still makes mistakes
‘that are costly. He is deﬁnitely the best shooter on the team. Coach
Bob Timmons indicated this last Wednesday against Tech when he
had Jinks, a sophomore, shooting a technical foul.

Last year Jenks led the- freshman scorers with «almost a
game average of 2d points. He started of!‘ slowly this year but
has moved up to the top of the Panther shooters and may stay

there.

Maloney plays a lot like Jinks. He, too, possesses a good jump ’

shot,_ and when he drives he brings back memories of Duquesne’s
Si Green. On defense Maloney is most valuable. Timmons will al-
ways have him watching the opponents top back court man.

Maloney is from Dormont and has spent the last two years in
the Army where he played with the service team while touring
Europe. He played for the Panthers three years ago along with
Hennon, Julius, Peguaes and Chuck Hursh. That team got a bid to

NCAA.

Maloney will look great at times and then take a couple extra
steps or else throw the ball away. Timmons relates this back to .

Maloney’s army days. “When your playing service ball the of-
ﬁiciating is not very good, and the coaching is inadequate,” Timmons

said.

Maloney has his own ideas about service ball, but one thing
that he knows is different is the game attendance. Jinks also is
used to displaying his wares before larger crowds. Maloney and
Jinks have the court ability, the only thing lacking is an appre-

ciative gallery of fans.

Well, no matter what the attendance Ben Jinks and Tom Ma-
loney will be around for the next couple of years and for those fans
who do get a chance to get up to the Field. House watch these two

boys. They could be great.

Drop Indiana

90-62, Win Streak Now At 3

The Panther frosh hoopers defeated Indiana State Col-
lege by a decisive score of 90-62. After opening a 44-28 gap
at the half, the game was never in doubt. Coach Peterson
’ used a two platoon system, frequently substituting an en-
 tire team, thus giving the regulars plenty of rest.

‘ “The score told the story,” Coach Peterson said. The

boys looked good. They played?

much better than in previous
games. Our rebounding deﬁnitely
hurt them, especially under me
offensive boards.”
Rebounding well for the Cubs
'were Paul Krieger, Brian Gen-
eralovich and John Jenkins.
Generalovich showed the way in
scoring with 21 points, while

Cal Sheﬂield and Dave Sauer»
collected 15 and 13 points re-
spectively.

After losing their opening game
to Slippery Rock, the Blue and
Gold have not-lost a game. This
win gives the yearlings a 3-] rec-
ord.

» Eight Gridders Pickedliy NFL,
W. Pros Select Four ‘Red-Shirts’

Despite the fact that the Pan-
ther football team recorded a so-
so 4-3-3 record, the professional
pigskin connoiseurs weren’t hesi-
tant to pluck a record eight play-
ers. in the annual NFL lottery last

--Week.

Mike Ditka, All-American end,
was picked on the ﬁrst round by
the Chicago Bears. Other depart-

' ing gridders taken were tackle
Dick Mills and guard Paul Hodge,
Detroit Lions, and'.Jim Cunning-

ham, already in the Redskins pact.

Four junior eligibles were pick-
ed also, giving an indication of
the strong effect of “red-shirting.”
Buddy Parker had hopes of get-
ting quarterback Ed Sharockman,
but the Minnesota Vikings beat
him to the draw. The Baltimore
Colts chose Back Bob Clemens and
End Steve J astzrembski. Fred Cox
was selected by the Cleveland
Browns.

There ’s No Place ilce Home

By Jim O’Brien

They say there’s nothing
like home cooking, and the
Panther ﬁve certainly feasted
on the appetizers which they
were served at the Field
House during the holiday

break, winning three consecutive
games on the home court.

No sooner had Bob Timmons’
protoges digested two Ivy League
goodies, Dartmouth 54-50, and
Brown 57-51, when they proceed-

ed to gobble up neighboring Car- .

negie Tech, 75-66 on Wednesday
night.

The Dartmouth Indians were a
sadly inept crew, even A though
their coach “Doggie” Julian has
coached some great ones in the
past, including Bob Cousy, George
Kaftan and Rudy LaRusso.

Interesting Offense

Brown was a better representa-
tive of Ivy League basketball, dis-
playing a figure-eight offense
which ex-panther mentor “Doc”
Carlson claimed “was the most
interesting offense I’ve seen all
year.” -

Sparked by a 21-point per-
formance by Tom Maloney and
.a splendid 48% team shooting
average, the Cats overwhelmed
Tech, which lacked the egres-
sive spirit which they are re-
nowned for. The Panthers
caught the Tartans with their
kilties dragging, and beat them
on the fast break, with John
Fridley starting the races with
24 rebounds.

After the game Tech coach Mal
Cratsley, kidded Timmons, “Gee,
you've won three in a row, Bob.

{ion mm‘ ' ONS
Leads Cagers Over Holidays

all the way."
Non-Statistical Action

Other non-statistical . a c t i o n
which oecured during these games
would have sent the late Damon
Runyon scrambling for a type-
writer, tongue-in-cheek. The Pitt
Players couldn’t have upstaged the
hoopsters foi presenting bits of
comedy and tragedy.

Chief Julian had two little
Indians who caught the fancy
of the crowd. A 5’8” Brooklyn-
ite, Gerson Elliott bounded
.about frantically, waving his
four limbs in the faces of his
taller adversaries. touching his
toes at times.

A sub, Steve Spahn. no relation
to the Milwaukee southpaw, “even
though he’s gotﬂie nose for it,”

according to sports commentator
Mal Alberts, looked as though he
would have been more ‘at home

playing with Prince Charles on a

cricket field.

The crowd jeerea him because
of his feminine gait. He proceeded
to fire 25-foot jump shots in a
flurry, hitting six of ten shots to
close the gap in the late minutes.

The riotous Golden Glove
fisticuff preview between Du-
quesne and Geneva has been re-
hashed enough, but Roger Mc-
Gill had a busy evening on

Wednesday. First, he had to

attend to the pugilistic Tornadoe
student manager.

In the windup game, John Frid-
ley lost a contact lens, which
shattered. They sprinkled the re-
mains in Rodger’s hand, but he
was finally stumped for a remedy
of cure. Even his tape failed him,
so Fridley appeared in large black
spectacles, resembling a towering
Groucho Marx.

the 157 pound class Zolikoff shut
out Cornell’s Pete Cummings
3-0. Zolikoff scored on a rever-
sal late in the second period and
an escape in the final period.
The biggest surprise for the
Panthers came in the heavy-
weight class. Bob Guzik took a
15-3 decision from Cornell’s
George Loveless in the highest
scoring match of the afternoon.
Al Marion of Cornell downed
Augue. Arrigone 7-0 at 167 and
