outgrown the housewife’ role, a mystique about women has ar'-
rested their intellectual growth and, according to Mrs. Friedan,
F remains a primary barrier to the realization of their potential

as human beings.

Mrs. Friedan admitted that, as a wife and ‘mother, she felt
guilty aboutneglecting her home and children for her career

heighten. her interest in - woman’s » preoccupation‘ with her

traditional role.

at Thursday’s meeting. Hours for
today and tomorrow will extend
from 12 to 4 p.m. in 306 SU.

“I stopped accepting books last

Smoker Launches Frat. Rush
By VIJAY JAIN ' ' 1

The formal rush season- for the‘ fraternity groups on
campus will open Wednesday at.8' p.m. with a smoker in SU
ballroom and will continue through to January 26 at 1:30
a.m., William Chaps, chairman of IFC’ central rush commit-

tee announced. -

A new feature this year will be a stag smoker on Friday

at all the houses. “This will en-9 -

able the rushees to have an op-
portunity to visit all the houses
and meet the brothers, this is not
often possible in a mixed party,”
Chapas explained. '

The smoker itself will open
with remarks by Parker Enwright,
assistant dean of men and ad-
visory to fraternities, and Mark
Bebko, president of IFC. These
statements will be to orient the
prospective rushees about the
Greek system.

After the speeches the rushees
will be able to register, meet with
fraternity men, make engage-
ments with them and ask them
any questions. Five members from
each fraternity on campus'will be
present at the smoker for this
purpose. _

Chapas disclosed that coming to,

the smoker  does: _.;not, obligate .

0 go Greek, but he has

   

come to the smoker to pledge a
fraternity than otherwise.

Chapas went on to say,_“Join-
ing a fraternity is a personal de-
cision which can only be made
with adequate and accurate
knowledge. Recently we’ have
made systematic research, the re-
sults of which are not known yet,
show that there is great misinfor-
mation about fraternities. IFC is,
thus, trying a more factual ap-
proacl: towards rush, to remedy
this si uation. ‘

“Come to the smoker, ask ques-
tions and then make up your own
mind,” Chapas advises the inter-
ested men.

Last term, two thirds of those
who registered for rush joined a
fraternity, Chapas disclosed. “For
a campus of this sort, that's a very

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

A new innovation has been added in the larger
cities of the country to make the more popular new
movies easily accessible to the masses. It used to be
gospel to present a very latest and most expensive ﬁlms
in the ﬁrst-run Broadway-like atmosphere, and if the

' ﬁlm was a success it would remain at that theater for
months and ’months. At the present time a feature known as
“Premiere Showcases” or “Premiere Engagements” has been in-

troduced to movie-goers and it has proved to be a major success
from both the business and audience viewpoint.

The idea of “Premiere” Showcase” involves a saturation
booking of a new major ﬁlm into not one ﬁrst-run- house, but
into about ten or twelve theaters in as many locations as pos-
sible. This gives a person in the suburbs or in a smaller town

A’ a chance to see the importantpnew ﬁlms and not have tovwait
around for six months before the ﬁlm reaches his area. He
doesn’t have to travel into Pittsburgh or into New York City's
theatrical district to catch the latest Doris Day-James Garner
comedy, Move Oper Darling, or a Yul Brynner ,opus called
Kings of the Sun. The movie, goer can attend a nearby thea-
tre that belongs to the new booking system and see the same
ﬁlm, which is attracting the holiday crowds to the plush, pala-
tial arenas of the major American cities. '

7 This latest attempt by the ﬁlm operators to reach as many
patrons as possible has resulted in tremendous business and
great popularity. Cheaper prices, easy locations, and the avoid-
ing of large pushing masses of people are some of the reasons
for the success of the new venture. The ﬁrst-run feature of
the past is quite likely to be pushed right out of the Ameri-

_ can scene of the future. No longer will it become‘a status sym-

bol to say, “I caught Lover Come Back at the Palace,“ or “We .

saw The Cardinal at the Fulton.” It won’t make any difference

where you saw the movie and I’m sure that no one will be
impressed if you say that you had seen Cleopatra at the ‘Main

Street last Saturday night. t/' ' ' ' 

Probably the only theatres that will remain first-rune
will be those equipped to show the oddities ﬁlmed in"
Panavision, Technerama, Super 70, Colossalscope, and as-
sorted camera concoctions. A movie such’ as Mad, Mad,

Letters Dispatched

According to Dean Helen Poole
Rush, letters have been dispatched
to female ‘students who have
shown academic promise to in-
form them of the seminars and
“Fellowship Corner.” A A

“We want to get these girls
‘to plan realistically for long-
mnge Study goals,” said Dean
.Rush. “Too often they look
forward to a baccalaureate de-
gree and/or ‘marriage and do -
not investigate the opportuni-
ties presented in graduate
study.” A - .

Dean Rush was quick to point
out that the seminars are open to
both male and female, undergrad-
uate or graduate students.

Committee of Three

A committee of three was ‘re-
sponsible for most‘ of the work
done in the two-fold program”
Members of that committee are
.Mrs. Frances M. Holland, asist-
ant dean of women; Dr. Putnam
Jones, dean of the graduate fac-
ulty, and Miss Lorena Garloch,
associate -director of libraries.

The commtteel has arranged
for fellowship data to be index-

ed, and made easily available to
students, both undergraduate

and (graduate. Reserved for that . .

express purpose, the “Fellow-

“Go west, young man” was

come—ignorance and fear, bar-

riers to understanding in human
relations.”

To awaken the pioneer spirit,
then. is the purpose of his cov-
ered ‘wagon journey from Ama-
rillo, Texas to New York City and
the World’s Fair. Wearing a red-
checkered shirt, leather /vest,
boots, and long hair, he looks the
part of a pioneer.

Since the theme of the 1964
World’s Fair is Pioneering, Wil-
liams saw an opportunity to
“challenge Americans to pioneer
not only in vocations and knowl-
edge, but love and concern for
thsiir fellow man.” His concern
for understanding in human‘ rela-
tions prompted him to leave his
public relations work in Amarillo
last April. Since then, averaging
ten miles a day, .he estimates he
has met some 50,000 people daily.

On his trip, Williams speaks at
schools and organizations such as
saddle clubs on topics ranging
from guidance and public rela-
tions to sports and horsemanship.
One of his traveling companions,

.a nine month old prairie wolf,

serves as an illustration of the
importance of educating human
beings for good, .

“If you don’t do something
with the wolf, 'he’s'just a wolf.
If man’s mind isn’t cultivated,
it remains the same way. The

.wolf . makes friends wherever
we go. If I had trained him not
to trust strangers, he could well

Unlike the pioneers of the old
West, Williams does not have to
blaze his own trail. He travels
on main highways and unlike to-
day’s motorists, he has the time
to watch the expressions on the
other drivers’ faces. A smile comes
naturally to his lips when he re-
calls the surprise of the people
he meets. “Once a car passed
me; the driver turned to look
back and the car spun around. I

. guess he thought I was a bill-

board ’till I moved.”

Williams is sponsoring the trip
himself. “I’ve’ refused lots of
sponsors because they want to
capitalize on it for some selﬁsh
reson,” he explained.

I “Since it is difficult to cook out
in the winter, the Marine Corps
is supplying me with combat ra-
tions.”.He doesn’t ﬁnd it any
easier to ‘sleep out in the cold
either, although he has slept- in
his sleeping bag in sub-zero
weather. '

After arriving in New York
City, hopefully around April 22,
Williams plans to camp inside
the Fair grounds and set up his-
torical displays to “educate and
entertain people of all ages.”

for another student .or an eld-

beat]: of Foreign Ail/ 

> By Klemberg
This isthe ﬁrstpart of a" '
_ two-part series. _
Foreign aid is dead. Not the bill, nor the agency which ad-

ministers these funds, but the fundamental program and ideals of

the foreign assistance effort. The enemies of foreign aid, in and
out of Congress, have plotted ‘and succeeded in murdering a once
living, viable idea. This idea was that ‘the
United States,_ through resources of money, ma-'
terials, and brainpower, could achieve several
goals: (1) Initiate development in the poor‘ na-
tions of the world; (2) assure that the United

process in these nations; and (3) through the
above, increase our own security and enlarge
the " boundaries of the‘ Free World.

No‘ sensible, honest, knowledgeable states-
man would have, or did argue that foreign
, aid would‘ guarantee friendship or anti-Com-
munist allies. No statesman with the above traits would have,
or did promise a program without mistakes. And noahonest states-
man would have, or did promise quick results. One of the dim-
culties with the program‘ is that some of its past supporters have
over-zealously promised all of these, with the fatal result being
the rationale behind the plot to eliminate’ the program. '

_ It can be argued that the supporters of the program were
large contributors to its downfall. They never went to the Ameri-
can people with an explanation of the program. They never ex-
plained sufficiently the transition from aiding the developed na-
tions of Europe to ‘building new states where none had existed
before; They learned to accept an obvious plot to destroy the pro- .
gram which Congress perpetrated annually, where they should
have fought it. The annual struggle over~foreign aid in Congress
was treated with growing humor as- a familiar drama replete with

  

a colorful’ cast: Otto Passman, Wayne Morse, Bourke Hicken_- '

looper, Howard Gross of Iowa, the prevailing President and Secre-
tary ,of' State, and endless interest groups.

V But beneath the grudging battle of foreign aid appropriations
those who would destroy the effort found the ready-made ration-
ale for its destruction and began the long, hard process to achieve
their goal. Starting at the very beginning of the program, when
the Marshall Plan was conceived, the opponents of the program’
produced tons of material distorting the purposes and methods of
foreign aid. The emphasis was shifted about 1958, when the aid
program itself changed in character. Criticizing the complex job
of nation-building was easier to do than criticizing the re-building
of Western Europe. a .

The underdeveloped world was a perfect place for the easy-

-friends, no-mistake, quick-result foreign aid syndrome to start,

Pressed by the desperate fear of the program’s early end, the
supporters of the program began to promise miracles, just to
achieve the reasonable appropriation the program deserved re-
gardless. When no miracles appeared, "and, in fact, we were re-_
buffed by a Menon or Sukarno and faced with no new allies, the
failure of the program seemed clear to its critics.

It was during this period (the late 1950’s) that a strange
phenomenon arose. This was the beginning of “foreign aid frauds.”
In Congressional testimony, Representative Passman introduced
wild, often humorous tales which were patent lies. or distortions
of the truth. Using his privileged position as Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Passman introduced these
stories at points in the testimony when rebuttal was impossible.
Using the testimony of Passman as gospel truth, newspapers around
the country adopted these tales of fraud in foreign aid, ‘contrasted

’ them‘ with _thef easy-friends,‘ no-mistake,.,quick-result syndrome,‘ ,

    Syracuse Gymnasts Defeat
Panthers in Season Opener

By FRED BERLIN _

The Panther gym team opened their season last Satur-
day with a 147.5 - 144.4 loss to Syracuse at the Field House.
In spite of this, coach Warren Neiger» felt fairly satisﬁed

with his teams performance.

“Syracuse had a pretty good squad,” Neiger said. Con-
sidering the fact that this was our ﬁrst meet I was pretty

pleased with our overall show-6

ing.”
On the other hand there were
some weaknesses in the Panther
lineup, particularly in the long
horse event. This was partly be-
cause Roland James, a senior
letterman, who had been sched-
uled to compete in the long
i horse and in the side horse was
declared ineligible due to grades
a few days before the opener.
Neiger felt that James would
have been a potential ﬁrst place
winner this year.
‘ As a result of the loss of James,
V sophomore Bob Davies had to per-
'form in every event, and Neiger
was well satisﬁed with Davies
performance. He said, “Although
_ Davies was competing all after-
. noon he never quit. I was surpris-
‘ed that he stlil had enough left to
:9” _ win the ﬁnal still:-ings comqpeti-__

Neiger had to decide whether cap-

tain Ed Stim or Davies should

handle that assignment. “I_ felt
that Davies had had more experi-
ence with all around competition
than Stim,” Neiger said.
course, Davies made the choice
look good when he won the still
rings.”

Altogether the Panthers had
two ﬁrst two second and ﬁve
thirds for the afternoon. In ad-
dition to Davies’ win on the still
rings, Stim took a ﬁrst in the
horizontal bar.

Sophomore Al Leonhard took a
second in the long horse and Stim
was runnerup on the parallel bars.

Second Half I
Showing Gives
Cagers Victory

Using a familiar pattern
Saturday night, the Panther

basketball _ team defeated -

Penn State, .69-60. It has
been a custom of
Panthers this year to fall
behind in the ﬁrst half and out-

score t h eir opposition in the
second.

State 1ed'by«as many as 11

 points in the ﬁrst half as their
’ zone defense completely baffled

the home team. But in the sec-
ond half the Panthers used the
fast break instead of having it
used against them.

Carver Clinton, State’s ﬁne
sophomore, who was held to
eight points’ by Dave Sauer,
complained in the second half,
“That court seems like its a
mile long.”' ‘

Coach Bob Timmons - used ._
only seven players to gain the
win. Guard Tim Grgurich sat
out his-ﬁrst game of the year,

c and center Bob Lovett also
remained on the bench. “I
needed K-rigeer in their at
center because he has the ex-
perience,” said Timmons.

Krieger used that experience I

well. He scored 15 points and
grabbed the same number. of
rebounds. It was Krieger who
tipped in'a rebound with 5:25
remaining who put the Pan-
thers ahead for good, 57-55.
On the preceding play he had
tied the score with two foul

shots. The importance of the‘

play, however, was that on it,
Ray Saunders, State’s high scor-
er with 16 points, fouled out.
For the next ﬁve minutes
State didn’t score, while the
Panthers were getting 14 in a
row. The surge was led by
.Brian Generalovich, the.
games’ high scorer with. 21
points. ' _
“Their zone gave us trouble

in the first half,” said coach~

Timmons in an understatement,
“but in the second half we
started to feed Krieger more in
the pivot. We knew that hnce
we got the lead they would have
to change their defense.”

While Timmons called this the
most important factor in the
game, the Panthers also played
outstanding defensive ball. They
limited the Nittany Lions to
only 24 points in the second

the I

his squad had been severely hurt due to academic difficulties.
What Peery didn’t know, however, was that the Syracuse team
was almost as badly‘ dismantled. ,

Orange coach Ed Carlin came here without NCAA heavy-
weight champion Jin Nance, outstanding, 191-poiunder Gerry
Everling and regular 167-pounder George ’Reid'en_er.' The ab-
sence of Nance and Everling meant little since the "Panthers
had the matched clinched by the time these bouts came_ up.

But the. absence of- Reidener was costly, according to
Carlin. “If Reidener was here he would have beat (Tom)
Baily at 167-pounds and that would have changed" the_
match,” Carlin. said.

Carlin also said that George Rogers should have beat Baily,
but he didn’t. Baily, a normal 147-pounder moved up 20 pounds
to take on Rogers and came out victorious, 3-1. Baily got a point
for an escape, a penalty point and a point for riding time.

Baily’swin put the Panthers only one win away from clinch-
ing the match and Lee Hall did just that as he avenged a 1963

loss to Lew Roberts to win, 3-1. Hall scored on a take down and
an escape.-

‘Rogers couldn’t ‘understand how he lost to Baily. He
said, “I thought ‘I had the match all the way, even near the
end. I still don’t know how I lost.” ' ' ‘

I The Orange gave the Panthers ﬁve points before the match
got started by only weighing in _two men'in the lower three
weight classes. They had to forfeit one of the bouts andedid so
in the 130-pound class where Mike Johnson was an almost sure
winner for Pitt.’ .

The Orange won the 123-pound class as last year’s Eastern
runnerup Terry Haise decisioned Duff Killian, 4-0., ' '

, ‘Ron Pritts, a normal 123-pounder for Syracuse, could not
make the move _to 137-pounds successfully and was, beaten by
Clair Riley, 3-0.’It was Ri1ey’s ﬁrst varsity meet.

S Dino Boni also scored a win forthe Panthers in his:..ﬁrst
varsity meet by defeating John Dussling, 6-0, at 147-pounds.

In other matches Dick Slutzky of Syracuse defeated’ Frank
O’Korn, 7-1, at 157-pounds, Barry Raichlin pinned Panther foot-
ball player Bill Beck at 19‘1-pounds and _Jim Murrin beat Don
Caslow of Pitt at heavyweight. The difficulties that both teams
had were emphasized’ in the heavyweight’ match where both
grapplers were normal 137-pounders. ‘

Peery could have called on Ken Barr at 191-pounds in-
stead of the inexperiencedlBeck, but -since the match was
clinched, Peery wanted to give Barr’s ailing knee another week
of rest before facing Army this Saturday. V "T

Levine Twins Each Win Twice

As Swimmers Trample Lehigh

Saturday’s Panther-Lehigh swim meet could best be summed ,

up in one word —— Levine. The Levine twins, Rob and‘ Ron, over-
shadowed some ﬁne individual performances by Don »Hannfe1dt,-44'
Bill Shanahan and Rick Petterson in leading the Panthers to a

63 - 32 victory.

Rob took firsts in the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard back-
stroke 'and Ron was victorious in the 200-yard
individual medley and the 200-yard butterﬂy.

Rob Levine was pushed to his utmost in both
of his wins as/teammate Wayne Pappert was a
close second in the backstroke as was Lehigh’s
Stew Earley in the freestyle. Rob’s winning time
of 2207.6 in the backstroke was better than three
seconds off his school record.

Ron Levine’s winning time in the individual
’medley was four seconds off the school record‘

that he owns and his time in A
the butterfly was more than '

nine seconds away from the
school mark he owns in that
category.

The intellectual atmosphere here breeds a new strain
of athlete, the scholar-athlete. These’ are the athletes
who place as much emphasis on scholarship as on athletic
prowess. Paul Martha, all-America halfback, and Ernie
Borghetti, all-America tackle, are two such athletes who
plan to continue this policy through graduate school.

Both have signed professional football contracts, and.

both plan to attend graduate school. ‘
Borghetti recently signed withthe American Foot-

_ ball League’s Kansas City Chiefs for an estimated $41,-

500 spread over a three year period. Included in his con-
tract is a scholarship to Dental School.

Borghetti, whose speech is scholarly, butwhose _
walk isvelephantine, explained his reasons for sign-
ing. ‘‘It’s not that I’d rather be a dentist than a foot-

, ball player, but I have to think of the future. I need
something to fall back on.”

The 245-pound tackle then explained that he

wouldn’t have played professional football at all if not
for the dental school clau_se in the contract. ‘‘That’s one
of the reasons I didn’t sign up with the Cleveland
Browns,” Borghetti explained. “They weren’t too high on
the dental school deal. I wouldn’t sign without it.”

Martha plans to attend law ‘school and play with

the Pittsburgh Steelers. He has no scholarship clauses
in his contract, buthe doesn’t care. “I’d like to attend
Duquesne Law School at night, and play for the Steelers
duringthe day. Jimmy Orr (former Steeler end) did ‘it.
I guess I can do it, too.” ,‘

, Martha, who has a 2.8 QPA, and is a psychology
major, explained why he decided to play pro football.
“When you’re successful in something, you grow to
like it. When I ﬁrst came here, I didn’t plan on play-

, ing pro football. But I.had considerable success my
junior and senior years,” he said candidly.

Martha, who is a combination between Pavlov and

Sir Launcelot, explained why he signed with the Steelers

. quickly, rather than using the Appletonian Scott theory

of waiting until the price reaches twice his worth.

“I knew I was going to sign with the Steelers when
they drafted me,” he explained. “I might have beneﬁtted
from a battle between the AFL and the National Foot-
ball League, but it would have been a waste of my time.
I want to play in Pittsburgh. .

V‘‘I't’s not the glory of the game so much as the chal-
lenge of playing,” Martha said. “At least if I don’t make

2 it, I’ll never have the kind of doubts that (John) Carlisle
-may have. Kansas City offered him alot of -money to
