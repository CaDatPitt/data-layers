FOOTBALL

  Wisconsin
  AD says

  Chryst will

stay at Pitt

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor"

Two days after Pitt football head
coach Paul Chryst released a state-
ment saying he was “committed”
to Pitt, Wisconsin athletic direc-
tor Barry Alvarez has echoed that
sentiment.

During a press conference to
explain how the Wisconsin football
program will move forward after
head coach Bret Bielema left for
Arkansas, Alvarez dismissed the
suggestion that Chryst would re-
turn t6 his alma mater and replace
Bielema.

“I asked some very good friends
of mine to help Paul get that j ob [at
Pitt] ,” Alvarez said. “I think Paul
has already come out and said that
he’s committed to Pitt. ‘I think he
should be committed to Pitt.”

Given the relentlessly competi-
tive state of college football, Alva-
rez then surprised many by saying
that he didn’t think it’d be moral
to ask Chryst to return after just
one year at Pitt.

“I wouldn’t think it would be
right for him to leave after one
year. I wouldn’t feel right, and I
don’t think it would be appropri-
ate for me to hire him back after

I asked someone to do me a favor

and help him get that j ob,” Alvarez
said.

Chryst played quarterback at
Wisconsin and was the Badgers’
offensive coordinator for seven
years before coming to Pitt. I,‘ A

Paras Minhas wins Marshall Scholarship

Pitt student to pursue graduate studies in biology in London

Parthena Moisiadis
Staff Wrz'ter

When Paras-Minhas spent a sum-
mer two years ago teaching health
education in Ghana, he encoun-
tered an event, that would signiﬁ-
cantly impacthis career choice.
After watching a woman go into
cardiac arrest,-"he found himself
fascinated withiia physician’s tire-
less efforts to help her.

“The physician who was trying
to revive her knew that statisti-
cally it was not likely she would

survive. In fact, a person who goes
into cardiac arrest loses brain and
bodily functions within four to six
minutes. However, the physician
did not give up,” he said.
Although the woman didn’t
survive the incident, this experi-
ence reaffirmed Minhas’ belief that
medicine was his calling. And late
last month, Minhas, a Pitt senior
majoring in chemistry, mathemat-
ics and microbiology, was named
one of 34 undergraduate students
nationwide to receive the Marshall
Scholarship. A A‘

 

Minhas, of Baltimore, Mary-
land, learned in November that he
was a recipient of the prestigious
award. The scholarship, designed
for students to act as ambassa-
dors from the U.S. to the U.K. to
strengthen British and American
relations, will ﬁnance Minhas’
graduate studies in biology at the
University College London.

Judith Zang, director of nation-
al scholarships at the University of
Pittsburgh Honors College, said
Minhas’ motivation, discipline

and ambition helped him win the

scholarship and set him. apart from
the other contestants.

“You cannot win such an award
unless you have [those characteris-
tics] on top of intellectual stamina,
curiosity and commitment,” she
said.

Zang also highlighted Minhas’
perfectionism as a quality that en-
abled him to win the award.

“You have no idea how many
times he rewrote things because
he wasn’t satisﬁed,” she said.

Instead of overﬂowing the trash rooms in
dormitories at the end of this semester,
students can embrace the holiday spirit this
week by giving back to their community
through Clutter for a Cause.

Alpha Phi Omega’s Shannon Achille,
a sophomore global health major, and
Daniyal Zaidi, a junior studying politics
and philosophy, are co-directors of the
donation drive, which aims to collect three
types of goods: clothing, electronics and
non-perishable food. Donations will beneﬁt
Goodwill, eLoop and the Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food Bank.

An initiative that assists with the recy-
cling of electronics, eLoop allows‘ students
to donate items such as broken computers
or old wires that no longer serve a purpose.
Even small appliances will be accepted.

The drive will begin today, and the ﬁnal
collection will take place next Friday, Dec.
14, giving students an entire week to drop

off their goods. Collection bins will be set up
in Bruce Hall, Litchﬁeld Tower C and in the
lower level of LitchﬁeldjTowers lobby near
Quick Zone. This way, if students purchase
non-perishable goods with leftover dining
dollars or are clearing out clutter in their
dorm rooms, the bins are conveniently
placed for donation.

“You probably have to clean out your
dorm room or your residence, so instead of
throwing it out and putting it in the trash,
you can let someone else put it to use,”
Zaidi said. , ’

The project was originally a part of Pitt’s

Green Fund, an SGB initative that ﬁnances .

and supports student—initiated projects
that beneﬁt the environment, but when the
Green Fund needed another organization to

take the drive on, they approached Alpha '
Phi Omega, a coed service fraternity at Pitt. it

“[Pitt Green Fund] tried to do it last year
and a couple years before, but I know espe-
cially last year, it didn’t work out because
of the bomb threats,” Achille said.

Achille is unsure of how many students

will donate this semester, but she hopes to .

Service fraternity wants students to donat

use the fall drive as a trial run to see how to
improve it for future semesters.

“I don’t really know what to expect. I
don’t know how full the bins are going to
be,” Achille said. “This is mainly prepara-
tion for the end of next semester, because
that’s a bigger move—out time. That’s when
people have more stuff that they want to
get rid of.” '

Clutter for a Cause fulﬁlls two goals for C I
Alpha Phi Omega: service tocampus and '

service to community. ’ T  

‘_‘The main goal of Alpha Phijomega is to
foster service through fellowship. .'Ba_sically,

incorporates the social aspects, of college
life alto gethe‘r;’,.’_f=>Z\j?ﬁ°£,Vl_, "V   ‘ '   .

Along with Carnegi'e'li7Ie n. ___niversity
Alpha Phi Omega participated in a clothing
and food drive earlier this year in which it

Dave Tobiczyk, the vice president of
marketing and development for Goodwill of
Southwestern Pennsylvania and a Pitt grad
himself, said Goodwill often teams up with
local universities, high schools and compa-

  

eyond providing clothing for the Ar-
privileged, saying that it sought to help
people who are struggling with employ-
ment barriers.

Tobiczyk said that through education

' and job training, Goodwill helps those who

face mental or physical disabilities, abuse,
young or old age, previous incarceration
or economic disadvantages. He said that
students are facilitating this effort by do-
nating.

“There’s a number of ways it helps  It
helps people who need low-cost clothing,
and if you donate to Goodwill, you are sup—

Marshall Schoiar Paras Minhas. Courtesy
Pitt Media Relations I

Minhas has won a number of prestigious
awards at Pitt, including the Chancellor’s_
Undergraduate Research‘ Fellowship, a
‘Brackenridge Spring Research Fellowship
and awards as a winning member of Pitt’s
debate team. He was also named a Goldwa-
ter Scholar and an Amgen Scholar last year.

On campus, Minhas serves as president
of two organizations: Longitude Pittsburgh
Organization, an agency that raises funds
for students in Ghana, and Pitt’s Student
Health Advisory Board. He has also au-
thored two peer-reviewed scientiﬁc papers.

In London, Minhas will speciﬁcally con-
duct research on the HDAC3 enzyme, an
enzyme that plays an integral part in the
regulation of DNA transcription. Minhas
ﬁrst worked with the HDAC3 enzyme this
past summer as a student researcher at Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology through
an Amgen Scholarship. A

The Marshall Scholar plans to exam-
ine this enzyme and its relation to mental
health, an issue that he has a personal inter-
est in investigating.

While his time in Ghana cemented his
career choice, Minhas’ interest in medicine
began at a young age. A few members of
his family were diagnosed with mental ill-
nesses, and, through observing physicians

search for remedies to his family mem-

bers’ issues, Minhas developed a passion
for medicine. ‘ ’

“My family did not know how to handle‘.

the situation. I turned to physicians’ —— indi-
vidualswho see death and illness on a daily
basis during this time,” he said. “Physicians
are rarely individuals who run away from
complicated problems.”

For Minhas, receiving the Marshall
Scholarship adds a ﬁnal bit of positive re-
inforcement to an accomplished under-
graduate career, a large part of which he
attributes to professors and administrators
at his undergraduate college.

Minhas said Pitt offers undergraduate
students many research opportunities.

He initially became involved with these

opportunities through the First Experiences
in Research program and by serving as a
research assistant at the Pittsburgh Institute
for Neurodegenerative Disease at UPMC.-’

“From there, I continued to branch out,‘

using skills and knowledge that I gained in
one laboratory to solve scientiﬁc questions
in other laboratories,” Minhas said.

Minhas said his professors never failed
to challenge him. .

“They like to test the boundaries of what
we students can and cannot handle, which
is something that I have a lot of respect for,
because in the real world, no one will be
there to hold your hand,” he said.

Li-Huei Tsai, a professor at Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, said Minhas

had the ability toiwork independently dur-
ing his time at her laboratory.

“Having had the pleasure of working
alongside Paras, I can conﬁdently place him
as one of the bestundergraduate research-
ers to have worked in my laboratory,” she
said.

Clearly, winning the Marshall Scholar-
ship is a steep cliff to climb for any student.
But Pitt’s latest recipient of the award said
undergraduate students should never let
the odds discourage them. .

“The statistical odds of receiving any
type of award are very low, but who cares?
Don’t pay attention to the statistics, pay
more attention to what you need to do to

c achieve your goals,” he said. I

Graduating Pitt students should
thank the people who've helped

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

In the words of the immortal
Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly
at the end of “Stepbrothers:”
It’s time to say goodbye. After
a year and a half as a columnist
for The Pitt News, this is my ﬁ-
nal column, and in classic Oscar-
speech style, I have many thanks
to share.

First I would like to send a
thank you to those Pitt News
Opinions editors past and pres-
ent whom I’ve worked with for
their many emails containing
correct grammar, undying en-
thusiasm and encouragement in
my opinions. But mostly I would
like to thank them for allowing
me to write about the things I
am most passionate about, such
as hard-shell tacos, the need for
a disco revival, karaoke and my
hatred for the thumbs up.

Thank you Lyons Den for giv-
ing me my column name. Eliza-
saurus Rex would have never ex-
isted without you.

Thank you Lothrop Hall. I
lived there as a nervous fresh-
man, and Lothrop had its own

special form of community that
deserves to be recognized. Keep
“throppin” it like it’s hot!

Thank you Pitt football team.
Actually, only for that one game
against Cincinnati four seasons
ago when your devoted fans
stood outside in the icy snow for
10 hours only to have you lose in
the last few seconds. You know
what, nevermind. I take that
back. _

Thank you Heinz Field for
that one time you “ejected me
from the premises” for throwing
a paper airplane. Though I was
furious at the time, you’ve given
me a great story — especially
when you sent a second security
guard “for backup.” Icing on the
cake, guys.

Thank you Market Central
for that one really, really good
grilled cheese I had the Sunday
I got back from Thanksgiving
break my freshman year. Seri-
ously, I still remember how good
that was. ‘

Thank you Ke$ha for coming
to Pitt that one time and giving
me an awesome day and making
me love you in spite of myself.
Now I’m hooked on your music.

Great. Thanks for that.

Thank you Towers Laundry _
Room for being cheaper than the
washer and dryer in my apart-
ment complex. Also, for offer-
ing me a judgment-free zone in
which I can wrap myself in my
warm, just—out-of-the-dryer
towel and snuggle for a moment
before getting the rest of my
laundry.

Thank you Hemingway’s ka-
raoke for many lost hours of
sleep, particularly on the nights
before midterms ‘and ﬁnals. A
ﬁnal rendition of “Total Eclipse
of the Heart” was always worth
staying until last call.

Thank you Cathedral of
Learning for housing about 95
percent of my classes; you’re‘
my favorite building. (National-
ity Rooms, you’re excluded from
this. Your desks are too uncom-
fortable.)

Thank you Dunkin’ Donuts
for coming to the Pitt campus.
Sometimes when it’s late at
night and I can’t fall asleep, I
think about the dark days when
you weren’t here — and ‘I never

Pittsburgh
baseball
legend
memorialized
in local
museum

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

Nestled in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville
neighborhood, The Clemente Museum is
unlike any other museum in the city — it is
by appointment only, located in a historic
ﬁre engine house, and it changes more
frequently than many museums.

“I add a lot,” said Duane Rieder, the
museum’s executive director. “I’m certainly
buying things faster than Carnegie. It is
just more affordable. A Clemente photo-

-‘ graph could range from $500 to $2,000,

while Carnegie may be buying a Monet
painting for $500,000.”

Rieder began his archive of Pittsburgh
Pirates legendary right ﬁelder Roberto
Clemente photographs and memorabilia
in 1996 when Vera Clemente, Roberto’s
wife, gave him about 50 photographs to
take back to Pittsburgh from Puerto Rico
because they were getting wet in her base-
ment.

Roberto’s wife’s contributions can
be seen throughout the museum, which

‘ changed from an archive to a museum
in 2006. Although Vera Clemente hasn’t
loaned Rieder many items, what she has
loaned him are some of the most valuable
in the building. Her contributions include
his two World Series rings, two of his 12

 Gold Gloves, one of his four Silver Bats

and plenty of personal photographs of the
Hall of Famer, who played with the Pirates
from 1955 to 1972.

“We don’t have a lot from them [the
Clemente family], but what we do have are
some incredible items,” Rieder said. “Even

’ ‘ the photographs are very personal photos

that were never before seen.”

While many Pitt students begin ﬁlling the Hill-

man Library in preparation for ﬁnals week, A

several Pitt athletic teams will compete in
hopes of improving their season records.

With the wrestling team looking for anoth-
er home victory over a ranked team and both
basketball teams in action, here’s aweekend
preview of Panthers sports:

 

The team will look to build momentum
with another home victory against the Ter-
rapins (4-1), who started their season with
four victories before falling to Illinois on Nov.
24. Friday’s matchup will mark the ﬁrst true
road test for Maryland, as its ﬁrst ﬁve matches
have come either at home or neutral sites.

A key test for the Panthers will be
184-pound Maryland juniorjimmy Sheptock.
Ranked No. 9 nationally, Sheptock received

second at the Nittany Lion Open on Dec. 2. Pitt 1

After dropping their ﬁrst two matches,
the Panthers (1-2) responded with a thrilling
victory over Virginia Tech at the Fitzgerald
Field House last Friday.

No. 9 heavyweight Zac, led Pitt to victory
against Virginia Tech with a walk- off pin, and
he will look to repeat the feat against Mary-
land’s unranked heavyweight Carl Buchholz.

Should the Thomusseits conquer, the
Panthers could improve their season record
to 2-2.

Freshman center Steven Adams led all
players with a career—high 14 rebounds against
Duquesne, drawing praise from Woodall.

“It is great to see him go out and get re-

an attacker to get rebounds. That boosted
us a lot.”

Woodall and the Panthers will look to boost
their win streak to a season—high ﬁve games

CLEMENTE

“I bought [the cleats] off his best friend

‘ “ in Pittsburgh, Phil Dorsey,” Rieder said.
“They’rejust incredible and very rare. Ev-
eryone wants to buy them because they are
so rare. They sit on the 1971 World Series
home plate from Three Rivers Stadium and
truly make an awesome exhibit.”

 5 Another exhibit, located on the second
floor of the museum, is the Silver Bat dis-
play. It is a favorite of Elizabeth Meyer, the
assistant director and only other full—time
employee at the museum.

“We have baseballs surrounding the
bat hand-painted by Duane to look like

    

leader in health care.

With items ranging froma 1909 Forbes

ente and fame_d Dodgers’ general manager 

Branch Rickeyjr. and several of/Clemente’s
signed bats, it’s no surprise that the sev-
eral members of the National Baseball Hall
of Fame and Museum were thoroughly
impressed when they visited in 2006.
“They were here in 2006 and were
completely blown away. That was when
we were just getting started, too,” Rieder
said. “They don’t have a lot of Clemente

items. I, probably have 100 times what

V Some of the more impressive items
 ‘that receive little publicity are Clemente’s
jerseys, which range from Pirates jerseys
;;to his jersey from the first professional

in bers of the Professional Baseball League
of Puerto Rico.
To give visitors a more personal experi-
,,:;.x».-,,_N,e,rV1ce_,‘several of these jerseys and plenty
ofthe memorabilia are not protected by
glass.

“We’re not like typical museums where
everything you see is behind glass,” Meyer
said. “Of course, we don’t want you to
touch the items, but I think it gives ev-
erything a much more personal touch.”

    

 UPMC
Urgent Care

The museum is looking to move into the
future with a more hands-on approach.
While Clemente’s contracts and family
photographs attract many older visitors,
children like to see more interactive dis-
plays. " ‘

“We’re wo rking toward making the mu-
seum more interactive and user-friendly,”
Meyer said. “An audio—visual catch as-

V, pect where you can watch Clemente catch,

throw and play would be cool. We’d like to
be more hip and cool. It would make the
museum more interesting to children.”

This New Year’s Eve will mark 40 years
since the death of Roberto Clemente, who
died when his plane went down while it
was taking relief supplies to Nicaragua
after an earthquake struck the Central-
American country. It’s no surprise that
some of the younger generationare for-
getting the famed right fielder.

“He’s a phenomenal humanitarian,”
Meyer said. “Too often, athletes are ce-
lebrities. Kids need a role model. A lot
of them choose one based on money but
should pick one who’s doing good for the
community. I want kids to keep his legacy
living on and be excited about him.”

Rieder’s passion for Clemente has
grown since being a fan of his as a child.
Some will argue that Clemente was the
best player to ever play the game. He hada
cannon right arm, recordedexactly 3,000
hits and remains the only player to have
the traditional five-year waiting period
Waived before being elected into the Hall
of Fame.

_ tistics, Rieder won’t argue Clementefs

baseball prowess, but he will talk about
his heroism. ‘ 

“He died the way he lived. He gave 
whole life to help people,” Rieder said. “I
won’t say he’s the greatest baseball player
ever, but without doubt, he’s the only true
baseball hero.” I V
