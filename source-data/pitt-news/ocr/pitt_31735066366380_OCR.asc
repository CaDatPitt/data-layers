Study Area
Suggested by
Student Govt.

Student Government’s (SG)
Committee for Improvement of
Student Study Areas, under Sen-
ator Barbara Stevenson, is con-
sidering a centrally located area
for students to use -for study.

The University’s libraries have
attempted extending their hours
but ﬁnd it is too” costly and not
enough students participate.

In the past, Schenley and the
Towers Cafeterias have been open
ﬁnals weeks for study. The dif-
ficulties encountered have been
too much noise, damage of equip-
ment, and a mess to clean up.
SG, supplied student monitors one
year and Saga Food Service has
paid employees to work c6ffee

machines but they cannot afford.

to provide a full time employee.

According to Jerry Hogan, pres-

dent of SG, “SG can afford to pay ,

someone to oversee.”~ The most

probable place for study would»

be in the Schenley Cafeteria
Sunday-Thursday night and per-
haps Sunday afternoons. A deci-
sion will be made next week.

“This proves. conclusively that
students, working in cooperation
with the administration can pro-
duce more concrete results than
prolonged debate,” Hogan said.

Money Grants

“Carnegie Corp. Awards 
For College Newspapers

A newspaper with a circulation of over 4 million is're-
garded as exerting ‘a substantial amount of inﬂuence, and
this is approximately the number of people" the more than
1,000 college newspapers reach. The editors of these papers
are instrumental inlthe formation, stabilization, and reflec-

tion of campus opinion.

The United States Student Press
Association will help" college
newsmen and women in their

jobs withva grant of $55,700 from *
the—Carnegie Corporation of New V»

York.

In announcing the grant,'A1an
Pifer, acting president of Carne-

gie Corporation, said, “One un- .

derlying premise is implicit in
this entire program.. Improved
campus communication is a criti-
cal need. Students and faculty
need to know more about higher
education in general and their
own institutions in particular so
that they can play a more crea-
tive andlconstructive role in de-
termining policy. Such a role can
only lead to greater understand-
ing 'of and indentiﬁcation with
their institutions.”

In order to raise and analyze '

issues in the college paper, the
United States Student Press As-
sociation will hold three week-
end seminars in February, March,
and April.

A ﬁve-week seminar will also
be held during the summer,‘ of
1966 for student editors and some

junior staff members, stu‘dents',,
T_ePIfeSe_I1ting different groups, 

" ‘i"‘.° 3.‘

these seminars will ‘be substan-

tially the same and will be in-._

clusive énough to interest editors
publishing daily papers as well,
as those publishing monthly.

‘ The Carnegie Corporation of

New York, with -assets totaling.
~ approximately $243 million, was
founded in I911 by Andrew Car- _

negie. Its purpose is the advance-
ment and diffusion of knowledge

and understanding among the

peoples of the United States and
certain Commonwealth countries.

end of the second year of that
term he is advised whether he
will be appointed for a second
three year term.

If he does not receive a sec-
ond appointment at the .end of
the second year, he has a full

year to negotiate for another

position at some other institu-
tion. If he does receive a second
three year term he would then
have four years ofguaranteed

this manner the University is
“fair to the man” and protects
his professional position.

By ROBERT TUTT

Has it ever occurred to you
that the printed page, like the
acne you are reading now, may
have been invented by a cave-
fman? The old engravings which
aid modern scholars in under-
standing the ancient world were
7 made in much the .same way that
our modern newspapers and mag-
azines are created.

Printing began longbefore the
printing press as we know it was
”* invented and even before the
iﬁrst alphabet was conceived.

», “The art of printing has always
been based on three fundamental
processes: relief or raised print-
ing, intaglio or below surface
‘printing and planographic print-
sing.

by Relief is theprocess by which
are produced most books and
‘newspapers today. The earliest
f relief printings was the wood-
Qcut. In this process, a design is
drawn upon a wooden block.

Then, all of the portion of the
-surface of the block outside of
the design is cut down to a depth
-Jot about an eighth of an inch.
The raised portion is then inked.
'-When the wood is pressed to pa-
per, the higher part: of the sur-
face transfers the design to the

,1 Printing Industry, Process Shows
, Various Complexities, Methods

Intaglio, on the other hand, is
the system of below surface
printing. A design is cut into a
plate, which is then treated with
acid and inked. The ink on the
surface of the plate is removed
but the ink in the deeper portion,
which forms the design, remains.

When the plate is pressed against
the paper, the paper'gathers up
the ink from the incision and
-absorbs it. This method is used
primarily for reproducing pic-
tures, rarely for verbal material.

The third method, planographic,
or surface printing, is a more
recent innovation than the other .
two, though its more‘than two
centuries old. The principle of
planographic printing is the ap-
plication of ink to the surface of

‘done in the old style.

old. Relief and intaglio printing
may even antedate the Greek and
Phoenician alphabets. It is sus-
pected by some that some of the
early case drawings were made
by printing from wood or stone.

Today, there are only a few
modiﬁcations. of this In ethod,_
such as the introduction of photo-
graphy into the printing process.
Now, photographs-l can be made
on printing surfaces, to facilitate
preparation of printing plates.

On Oct. 13, a demonstration of
these three printing techniques
was made by George Nama, in-
structor of ﬁne arts at the Arts

and Crafts Center in Oakland..
The prints class of Charlcs‘Min-
ott, instructor of ﬁne arts, saw '
a demonstration woodcut print-

ing, intaglio and lithography,

a plate and from the plate to
the page. The most commonly
employed pl-anographic method
is called lithography.

In this system, a design is
made on a smooth stone with an
oil base ink. The uninked por-
tion is wetted. The ink stays in
place because the oil will not
mix with the water. No cutting

is made into the stone.

ways some form of competition
between engineering depart-
ments. The winning department
receives points for the Shamrock
Award. _

Other Engineering Week com-_

Veteran Sends
Students Thanks

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘Dear Students:

As I looked at the enclosed
picture (Associated Press picture
‘of Oct. 27 rally) which was wide-
ly published to us GI’s, I am
sure we all have the same won-
derful feeling, Not one bearded,
long-haired shabby American in
the crowd of students. Pictures
of protest against the Vietnam
war are a sickening mass of char-
acters.

Sincerity is truly in all to be
_ ‘en. Over here you have no idea
of what you all have done for us.
May God bless one and all.

 I am an Air Force veteran of

‘-college. The minority of char-

acters will fade with time.

Saigon, Oct. 31

  Klan, Vietnam
Not Equitable

_tor, The,Pitt News:

In his letter to The Pitt News
Of. Nov. 3, Marshall Garber tries
to establish a relation between
‘support for the country’s poli-
cies in Vietnam and support for
e-Ku Klux Klan (KKK). By
his sarcastic reference to the
 as “that great American in-
7stitution,” thereby revealing that
he feels the KKK is generally ac-
cepted in America, Mr. Garber
makes me feel that he has either
lived his life in a large packing
‘crate or in a frame of mind cor-
responding to the “ignorance, big.
otry, and hat” he feels he is
ﬁghting.

, In the first place, the purpose
of the Oct. 27 demonstration was
to show support for the only al-
ternative we have to complete
“feat at the hands of the Com-
munistsf that alternative is vic-
_ry in Vietnam. Secondly, the
participants in the demonstra-
tion should take offense at Mr.

' Vice-Chancellor of Finance David Kurtz-
an has issued an edict prohibiting all stu-
ents from leaving their residences until
searched by University police. Kurtzman’s
action came after an off—duty University
oliceman realized Tower A was missing

* "We will not stop until we find the cul-
_ rit,” said Captain of security Charles Ray.
5‘ “My three man force will suspend the ardu-
us ‘task of towing carseand give top prior-
ity to interrogating students.”

 The Tower was in its usual resting place
‘Wednesday night, but it was gone Thursday
-morning. The alert officer noting the ab-
jsence was Elbert J. Donothing. “Well, I was
‘walking from the garage about 7 a.m.,” said
,_'-Donothing. “Then I noticed something fun-

 ,_ “MY FIRST reaction was to see if Dr.
;-Kurtzman had removed it for ﬁnancial rea-
;.sons. After all, this here place owes a lot of
dough and them‘ there Towers cost lots of
‘ oney to run, “Donothing continued.

 Ray” and Kurtzman are convinced the
Tower was stolen. “What else. could have
happened,’ said Ray in a detective-like man-
. “Itvcouldn’t have been misplaced. Per-
jsonally, I think it was a student prank for

'0 Kurtzman gave a more scientific analy-
"sis of the theft. “There are several possible
reasons for the theft,” he said. “First, our

Letters To The Ed

"127 years and also have a son in

 "Where Is Tower A? o

reduced janitorial staff may have stolen the
Tower as a gesture of indignation.

"SECOND, THE students may have
done it to prove they have some responsi-
bility and deserve more autonomy. Third,

Men’s Dorm Council and Student Govern-

ment may have done it as a cooperative ef-
fort to prove they can act. Fourth, it may
have been a stunt by the commuters to spite
the dorm students.” . —

When asked if the reduced security

force could be a cause of the theft, Kurtz-
man looked astonished. “Why the security
force is more than sufficient for a Univers-
ity this size,” he said. “We have 15,000 stu-
dents and 110 acres. Our three-man roving
security force can handle the important du-

ties of towing cars_and giving tickets.” -
Kurtzman felt that the protection pro-

vided the Towers, Student Union, and other
buildings was also sufficient. “There was an
excess of protection before we cut the force,
now we are operating at an optimum level.”

DIRECTOR OF the Physical Plant Cap-
tain William Fisher was out of town for the
third consecutive week and could not com-
ment on the crisis. I ’ ,

Student reaction was “righteous indigna-

tion” according to ex—President of Student

of shame that is lead by . . . the
KKK” and, therefore, anyone sup-
porting the war in Vietnam is in
favor of it.

Check your logic, Mr. Garber.
Who is trying to prevent this
country .from rotting like the
Roman Empire? The students
who supported the rally. /Certain-
ly not yourself, you seem to be
in favor of a political system
that has captured and enslaved
a billion people, and plans to
capture the remaining two bil-
lion people on earth.

Letter Takes
Mitchell Stand .

Editor, The Pitt News:

I ﬁrst felt a genuine sense of
outrage after reading the two
letters ‘attacking David Mitchell

in The Pitt News of Oct. 25; ﬁrst, .

by those “proud Americans,”
Messrs. Hogg, Garofalo, and Milo,
and second, the self-righteous
raving of Stuart Arnheim. Now
I only feel sorrow: sorrow for
those who judge without rigor-
ously examining their reason, the
honesty of their facts, and ‘their
own integrity; and even greater
sorrow for their victims. ,

The diatribe trio must have
extracted all the platitudes of
American lore and legend for
their heart-rendering “Introduc-
tion to Democratic Theory.” 1

They “hailed peace and liber-
ty” but somehow concluded that
David Mitchell’s comparison 01
Nazi “justice” to his own trial
experiences was not valid be-
cause in Germany “he would not
have lived to write his letter.”
Most interesting, gentlemen. I
had never thought of equating
freedom with being allowed to
live. Maybe the gentlemen sim-
ply overlooked. the following ob-
scure item at the beginning of
Mitchell's letter of Oct. 18:

“The judge callously tore to
.shreds my right to counsel of
my choice and to due process.
It was so. obvious -that the

happened in ancient Rome, Nazi Germany,

calling for a mistrial because
my rights had been violated.“

If you gentlemen _ are so -sure
Mr. Mitchell has no legitimate
complaints, if you are so sure
the-Vietnamese are getting a fair
deal, if you are so sure that it is

right to’ make their world safe’

for our democracy, if you are
actually “willing to ﬁght and die

, to preserve the liberty which we A ,
why H

possess in this country,”
don't you enlist?

While the writers of the first
letter have been‘ misinformed,
Mr. Arnheirn seems to be com-
pletely uninformed. He has seen
fit to wreak his vengeance, not
only on Mitchel, built on softies,
pinkos, Commies, and- dissenters
with the wrath of Johnathan Ed-

wards and the banality of Billy 0'

James Hargess.»

Let's see, Mr. Arnheim, who is
“either blind to the facts or will-
ingly refuses to accept them.”
You say that “America has little
choice when a friend calls for
help.” Come now, Mr. Arnheim.

‘ Wasn't the “friend” who initially‘

called for our help the benevol-
ent Diem regime, which we
placed in power after the Gene-
va Agreement of 1954?

Diem may have been a friend
of ours, but he was no friend of
the South_Vietnamese. Mr. Arn-
heim and those impressed with
the spirit of the American-lov-
ing Vietnamese deserve a ring-
side seat in Saigon when the
South Vietnamese celebrate the
annual Ho Chi Minh Day to hon-
or the father of their country.

“Harmless tear gas!” Is that
all, Mr. Arnheim? Accounts of
torture, atrocities, and our own

‘contributions to genocide ﬁll too

many periodicals to go unno-
ticed. Since you insist that “the

quickest way to end the war in ,

Vietnam is to show the world we
intend to ﬁght to the end,”, do
you suggest we employ “harm-
less tear gas” to do it? Anyone

‘who invokes the commandment,

“Thou shalt not kill,” as you
did, couldn’t possibly propose

You alarm us of Communist

do you know about Communism,
Mr. Arnheim? Can you ‘honestly
demonstrate the validity of your
implied position that’ Commun-
ism is monolithic? Or are there
signiﬁcant differences b e twe e n
Mao and Ho Chi Minh and Bre-

.shnev and Tito? Can you prove

that the Vietnam situation is a
product of outside agression in-
stead of a_ civil War with Ho Chi
Minh and the Vietnamese strug-
gling against the United States
and a power elite of vested in-
terests? Are you sure that the
“American way of life” can op-
erate in an area so alien to
America?

These are only a few of the
signiﬁcant -questions being ig-

nored by too many “proud Amer- ’

icans” who cling to their_shib-

_ boleths and only bar the way to

intelligent study and solution 'of
social conflicts. They prefer to
go on witch-hunts for “dirty, uri-
shaven, sloppy protesters” and
close their minds to the objects
of protest as they judge char-
acter by appearance. Theyoices
of dissent neatly fall into the
trite category of “pseudo-intellec-

is ,a stranger. That,is my sorrow.

contrasting conditions of the -

“THE HANDWRITING IS ON THE WALL”

ARA PARSEGHIAN was standing in the center of a
crowd of quote hungry reporters in the Notre Dame dress-
ing room. All around the Notre Dame mentor were the signs
which helped to make sure the Irish were mentally up for
the game.

The signs read “Pride wins ball games,” or “Pay atten-
tion to this——the Pitt Panthers want to win this game Very
badly—they came close last year and they think they can
do it again~—We know they can’t——Let’s prove it!”

_Of course signs don’t make tackles, or make ‘touch-
downs, but they did help the Irish get into the right mental
attitude. N otre Dame had to be thinking that the Panthers
were not up to their_ standards.

PARSEGHIAN also put up a sign of the Panther play-
ers by position and had quotes about each player. He point-
ed out four players in particular. .

There was ‘one quote about Barry McKnight saying,
I’m the big killer bull who ran over you last year and I’m
going to do it again this game.” A few impressive statistics
were written down beside his name to further psyche up
the Irish. _

“I’m Kenny Lucas and I’m the fifth best passerin the
country. I'm a great passer and an adequate runner. Im
the man -to stop.”- _

Naturally they had a sign about Eric Crabtree and what
a great receiver and runner _he.was_. They 3150 remarked
about the gridders big hard hitting linebackers.

THE OTHER quote that was on the poster was from
Captain Phil Dahar. His father had gone to Notre Dame
and had never gotten what he thought was a fair chance to
play. Dahar has been looking forward to playlng the Irlsh
all season. _ _ “ , '

Beside his name and picture was the caption, I_m thci
captain of this _Pitt team and I ve vowed that we will bea
Notre Dame this year.” Dahar never had a chance. .

Parseghian used this reverse psychology beautifully
because he had his team worried and it was obvious from
the start of the game that his team was hungry for a win.

“WE WERE LUCKY to escape with our lives last year,
and this year it was our easiest game.” It hurts to be called
the easiest, game of the year. , -

When Parseghian said “easiest game of the year,” the
letters P—R-1-D-E were even larger on the wall. It was not
difficult to see that the Notre Dame ball players did their
homework all week, they read the signs on the wall.

* IF *

NCAA BID

THE PANTHER SOCCER TEAM is still in contention
for an NCAA bid according to Mel Lorbach, West Chester
coach and selection committee‘ chairman. The booters are

for the Mid-Atlantic berth.

,The booters have only played one of the other teams
that is being considered and that is West Chester. They
lost that game, 4-1 in their second game of the season. They
have only given up four goals in six games since then and
have improved immensely.

Penn State is the Panthers’ opponents in two weeks and
the booters will have to win that game handily. Temple, an-
other team being considered is 7-1, and beat the Nittany
Lions last week. Penn State is not on the list, but has a very
strong squad. V

Wolski’s ﬁve touchdowns and
Ken Ivan’s nine extra point con-

football history. V

The big question before the
game was whether the gridders
would be keyed up enough to
pull off an upset, as had nearly
happened last year. The Irish
expected a. tough game and came
out ﬁghting. Midway through the
second quarter coach Ara Parse-
ghiza-n pulled out his ﬁrst team,
which had done its job with 35
quick points.

"‘I didn’t expect this score in
my wildest dreams,” said Par-
seghian. “I thought this game
was going to be a real hum-

how we barely got out of here.
alive last year and were expect-
ing a battle. I’d have to say this
was the" easiest game we’ve had
this year.”

Michelosen gave them credit
for their awesome power. “We
sure got run over again. I guess
the team couldn’t get up for
anything after last week. Syra-
cuse really took a lot out of us.”

The 57,169 fans were given a
preview of what to expect within
the ﬁrst minute of play. Notre.
Dame took the kickoff on its 32
yard line. On the ﬁrst play Nick
Eddy circled ‘right end for 26
yards down to the Panther 42.
Fullback Larry Conjar then cut:

 

 

There is no stopping‘ the
“Moustachio.” With only two
weeks remaining in the college
football season, George Lies has
a four game bulge in the Yogi
contest over Bill “The Log” Cab-
in and the Panther coaching
staff.

Despite his conﬁdent predictions
of victory, “The Log” managed
only a 10-5 record this past week-
end. Steady “Mgustachio” was
11-4 to keep him in. ﬁrst place
for the sixth straight week.

Debbie “Frateress” Solow
brought the girls into the fourth
spot with a ﬁne 11-4 slate. She
spurted past the players who
(with Kenny Lucas picking)

could do not better than 9-6.
Lucas, however, recognized the
Panther jinx and picked Oregon
to knock off Syracuse.

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein
brightened up his 11-4 mark with
the Air Force win over Army.
“Flatbush” had been the only
one to see the upset. Frank “Wim-
py” Smizik has virtually assured
himself of last place by record-
ing a 6-9 total. .

“Wimpy” stuck himself out on
a limb with many of his picks,
particularly Iowa over Michigan
State and Baylor over Texas.
Neither team came close to win-
ning, which is just about par for

“Wimpy’s” teams.

That was the way of the game

from then on. Grinding out the
yardage and grinding up the de-
fense, the~Irish ran off 74 run-
ning plays. For the game they
only attempted seven ‘passes.
They outdistanced the Panthers
on the ground, 363 yards to 40-.

All that was keeping the of-
fensive team on the‘ ﬁeld was the
arm of Kenny Lucas, who com-

pleted 14 of 29 passes. But only 5

on one occasion did a completion
come in the clutch.

With 32 seconds left in the ﬁrst
half, Lucas twisted away from
two fast charging linemen and
ﬁred a 21 yard scoring pass to
Bobby Dyer on the run. That

.. made the score 35-6. The next

time the gridders scored was in
the closing seconds of the game
with the Irish holding a relative-
ly secure 63 point marking.

“We just played a fundamen-,,

tally sound -game and were re-
warded with the score,” said Par-
seghian.

Parseghian also credited the
high score to the taking advan-
tage of Panther mistakes. About
the only mistake the Irish cap-
italized on, however, was the
Panther defense.

Four of Notre Dame"s ﬁrst ﬁve
touchdown marches covered 68,

Rassas’ intercepted pass.

When Bill Zloch did pass, it
caught the Panthers completely
off guard. Notre Dame’s sixth
touchdown was set up by a 30
yard pass to Don Gmitter. The
next time the Irish had the ball,
it was Gmitter scoring on a 44
yard pass.

For the frustrated Panthers it
was just a day of clutching the
turf and wondering what went
wrong. Since Notre Dame kicked
oﬂf 11 times and was only forced
to punt once, there was plenty
to wonder about. ‘

Officials Cause Bemis To Complain

By GEORGE LIES

Akron University became the sixth victim of the soccer
team, 1-0, last Friday at Akron, Ohio despite the referee’s
ejection of starter Dom Milillo early in the game.

Milillo’s ejection came about when he questioned the
referee’s call on obstructing the punting of the goalie.'Mi-
lillo, a part time goalie last season, learned, that a player

could obstruct the goalie as long
as the player stayed beyond the
penalty area around the goal. He
argued his point. The referee
said the player had to give the
goalie a ten yard leeway.
“‘Although I don’t condone
Bom’s action completely, the of-
ficiating in this game left some-
thing to be desired,” said coach
Leo Bemis. “Dom knew his point
because _it was called against him’
last year and explained to the

team by a, head referee before.

the ﬁrst game this season. The
referee, who had a brusk attitude
anyway, said he has always, call-
ed it his way. Both took the heat
a little.

“I1-'1 this game there was too
much roughness, but it would
not have been if the referees
were a little more conﬁdent and
had the players been playing soc-
cer. A good competent referee
would give the boys a ‘word’ af-
ter seeing, something which is
wrong,” Bemis said.

Pete Snyder replaced Milillo at
rover and -later in the game,
Bemis used Bill Zurzola who also
doubled as a halfback. “Snyder
played well after setting down
as did Zurzola who is -used to
being up” there close to the line,”
Bemis said. '

Most of the action for three
quarters carried from one end of
the ﬁeld to the other with each

team missingscoring opportun-'

ities. Then midway'in the fourth
quarter, center-forward Dave
Shaffer found the spot for his
fourth goal of the season. It
came when Snyder’s shot rico-
cheted off the Zips’ fullback into
a crowd of players where Shaf-
fer promptly hooked it into the
upper right-hand corner of the
goaL

“This was one of the tougher
games for us,” said Bemis. “Ak—
ron, who is Vastly underrated,

has the best short passing team ,

we have played all year.

Although the Panthers’ Dave

among the ﬁrst ten ﬁnishers.

“They were really up because‘

we had beaten them last year,”
pointed out coach Carl Rees. “We
were up, too, but not enough.”
“Almost every man on their
team ran about a minute faster
than ‘ever before. Their coach

“Their fullbacks played a tight
aggressive game against our
wings, but once we adjusted to
their moves, our switches work-
ed.

“When A.kron’s fullbacks came
out to meet our wings, our boys
would drop the ball in the va-
cated holes. This left just one
man, (Dave) Williams, in front
of the. nets,” continued Bemis.

.“Although Williams» is a tough
center fullback, Shaffer, after be-
ing rested, drove right by him. I
hope he’s playing there next year
because now I know how to get
by him,” Bemis said.

Akron only got eight shots ‘to
the booters’ ten, but some of
them would have been scores,
but for goalie Lou Cepanec and
his front line defense, Art Rich-
ardson, Cal Bonawitz, and Jim
Cuddy.

One shot came on a corner

kick. It curved in towards the _

goal, but Cepanec caught it. Ear-
‘ly in the ﬁnal period, he dived
right at a ball and ran into a
player. “Lou said he was okay,”
said Bemis, “. . . but after the
game, he laid stretched out on
the ﬁeld. He’ll be all right though
because Lou is tough boy.”
Halfback George Sommer also
looked okay after an Akron play-
er literally ran him over when
Sommer tried to head a ball.
Sommer suffered a cut eye which
required four stitches. ’

”ToiletBowlClash‘;
Sub Smizik Stars

Who Wants a roll of toilet
paper anyway?

But the real question
which passed through the
minds of the Pitt News

Hawks fans was “Where is George
Lies?” “Moustachio,’d’ as'he is
known to his parents and girl
friend, failed to make the scene
as the Hawks ‘starting quarter-
back. Was \he worn out from
Homecoming or_ was the pres-
sure of the publications match
too much for him? There were
some murmurs of kidnap by the
opposition rustling through the
spectators. George was unavail-
able for comment.

As a result, star halfback Frank
“Wimpy” Smizik was pressed into
service as signal caller. “Wimpy”
connected to a 67-yard bomb to
Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein.

Oh yeah, the Owl won the
Toilet BLAH, 20-0.
