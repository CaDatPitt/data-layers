Students to Receive Study
Lists on their Return
From Vacation

Will Mail Permits

Beginning at 8 o’clock Vvednesday
morning, January 4, the ﬁrst contin-
gent of students participating in sec-
ond semester registration will receive
study lists at the ofﬁce of the Univer-
sity registrar. This, the ﬁrst step in
carrying out early registration, was
included in an announcement of de-
tailed directions made today by Reg-
istrar John C. Quick,

First to receive study lists and be-
gin second-semester registration will
be classiﬁed students in the College,
School of Business Administration,
and School of Education who are
scheduled to enroll on January 4, 5,
and 6 respectively Students in En-
gineering and Mines will be notiﬁed
to call at the offices of their depart-
ment heads for study lists at any
time between January 4 and 18.
Graduate School students will get
their lists during the same period at
the oﬁice of the school, 206 State
Hall.

Preparations are being made by the
registrar to have all ofﬁces ready for
registration activity January 4, the
(lay on which students return from
the Christmas vacation. Schedules,
study lists, and registration forms
were being prepared during the past
few days for the two week enroll-
ment period.

Room 3. State Hall, will be regis-
tration headquarters during that
period. Students continuing their
ﬁrst semester schedule without any
changes are not required to obtain
advisory approval before registration.
These students can go directly to
Room 3 and register on the days they
are assigned. The office of the treas-
urer will receive second semester
tuition during the entire registration
period. Permits to register will be
mailed to students during the Christ-
mas vacation.

“It is very important that students
understand, ﬁrst, that early registra-
tion is required, not optional,” Regis-
trar Quick said today. “Inasmuch as
opportunity for changing courses and
sections is provided in the various
departments no one will have reason-
able excuse for not registering."

M,r. Quick announced that those stu-
dents who defer registration will face
inconvenience in closed sections and
will have to rearrange their entire
schedules. He advises all students to
register early regardless of whether
or not they are sure they will return
for the second semester.

WSCA Survey Committee

Announces Assembly Date

At the meeting of WSGA’s Survey
Committee, which took place last
week, Phylis Cook, chairman, an-
nounced the date of the assembly at
which freshman women will be taken
into the organization to be January
6. The time charts and question-
naires to be ﬁlled out by the freshman
women in order to determine the
time distribution of each one, are now
being printed and will be ready for
the assembly.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, spoke at the meeting and ex-
plained why the committee had been
organized and the value of the study
undertaken by it.

The committee will plot a chart to
see how far the charts of the group

Important research work . in the
early colonial history of Pittsburgh
and Western Pennsylvania has- been
greatly aided by the donation ofthe
Darlington Memorial Library to the
University.

The Memorial Library, given to the
University by Miss Mary O’Hara Dar-
lington and- Mrs. Edith Darlington
Ammon, contains about 14,000 vol-

umes and manuscripts. This valuable
source material of early American
history is being reviewed by Dr. Solon ,
J. Buck of the Western Pennsylvania!
Historical Society and his staff.

The collection, coupled with the
American history volumes and papers
of the Carnegie Library, offers the
ﬁnest opportunity for graduate re-
search work to be found in this coun-
try. Included in the Memorial Li-
brary are many small photographs,
drawings and prints of persons and
scenes in early American history.
These maps in the collection are rare
copies of the originals that are in
such repositories as the British Mu-
seum and the Public Record Ofﬁce in
London.

While these books are of little use
to undergraduate students, they offer
current thought written by outstand-
ing men of the time, without which
advanced students and research work-
ers would not be able to formulate
criticisms of the various actions of
the period.

The staff assisting Dr. Buck in-
cludes Russel J‘. Ferguson, who is
working on “Western Pennsylvania
Politics—1788 to 1824;” Randolph C.
Downes, “Indian Affairs of the Upper
Ohio Valley;” Leland D. Baldwin,
“Transportation in Western Pennsyl-
vania;” Alston G. Field, “Bibliography
of Early Newspapers;” Franklin F.
Holbrook is reviewing manuscripts.

Petroleum Engineers Visit
Pennsylvania Oil Fields

  

On Thursday and Friday of last
week the students in petroleum en-
gineering, accompanied by Dr. Ionel
I. Gardescu, assistant professor of oil
and gas, made a ﬁeld trip to the oil
ﬁelds of Western Pennsylvania. They
ﬁrst visited the pumping station at
Parker.

The students visited the largest col-
lection of ﬁshing" tools in the world at
the Spang Company in Butler and the
plant of the oil well supply at Oil City
on Thursday. . _

On Friday the students visited the
Smith lease at Plummers, Pa. On Fri-
day afternoon the students visited the
new cracking unit of the Benzoil Com-
pany, located at Oil City. They also
spent some time at the Drake wells
at Titusville, Pa. This last well is
interesting because it was the ﬁrst
oil well ever to be drilled in the
United States and marked the begin-
ning of the petroleum industry.

“Pittsburgh has {lost its Grand Old

Man.” Thus Chantellor John G. Bow-

man expressed the sentiment of the

University on theideath of Dr. Wil-
liam Jacob Holland, director emeritus

_ .. , _  is-.:...-.-....._......._.---.-_..---.
of Carnegie Museum, a member of the

Board of Trustees, and former chan-
cellor of the University.

Dr. Holland died at his home Tues-
day in his eighty-fourth year, after a
long and distinguished career as one
of the world’s outstanding men of
letters. Services were conducted on
Wednesday and interment was made
in Allegheny Cemetery.

“He was really grand in his char-
acter, in his achievement in science,
as an administrator, and as a spiritual
inﬂuence in Pittsburgh,” was Dr. Bow-
man’s further tribute to Dr. Holland.
“All of us, in the University and out
of it, in Pittsburgh owe to. his mem-
ory a greater debt than we can well
be conscious of."

Dr. George H. Clapp, president of
the Board of Trustees of the Univer-
sity, likewise honored the distin-
guished man of letters with the state-
ment: .

“I am afraid that we do not fully
understand what Dr. Holland meant
to the University of Pittsburgh; and
it will only be when its history is
written that the building of a college
into a university, his dream, can be
appreciated.”

Many tributes were paid the dis-
tinguished scientist, educator, clergy-
man, author, linguist and artist
Wednesday -by leading members of the
University administration. D1‘. Hol-
land was world-famous for his work
in zoology and paleontology, and re-
ceived honors and decorations from
educational and scientiﬁc societies and
rulers of Europe.

His last appearance before the
student body of the University oc-
curred at the 1932 June Commence-
ment exercises in the Stadium, at
which he delivered the invocation. Dr.
Holland had served as a member of
the Board of Trustees of the Univer-
sity since 1889.

All classes in the University were
dismissed at 2:30 o'clock Wednesday
afternoon by Chancellor Bowman in
observance of Dr. Holland's passing.

Completing his education at Mor-
avian and Amherst Colleges and at
Princeton Theological Seminary, Dr.
Holland came here as pastor of the
Belleﬁeld Presbyterian Church in 1874.
He became chancellor of the Western
University of Pennsylvania, now
Pitt, in 1891 and later became head of
Carnegie M_useum, a trustee of Ca.r-
negie Institute and head of the Car-
negie Hero Fund.

Dr. Holland was honored by the
Kaiser of Germany, President Fall-
ieres of France, Emperor Franz Josef
of Austria, King Victor Emmanuel of
Italy, the Czar of Russia, King A1"
fonso of Spain and the King of Bel-
gium. He received an L. H. D. de-
gree from the University in 1928 and
in addition held the degrees of Sc. D.,
D. D and L. L. D. from other schools.

As chancellor of the University,
Dr. Holland established the electrical
and mining engineering departments
and the schools of Medicine, Law,
Pharmacy and Dentistry.

Dr. Holland is survived by his
widow, Mrs. Carrie T. Moorhead Hol-
land, and two sons, Moorhead B. Hol-
land, vice president of the Peoples-
Pittsburgh Trust Company, and Fran-
cis Raymond Holland, an artist in New
York City.

“Become Advertising Men”

. Advises Industrial Leader

 

Editor’s Note: This is the sec-
ond of a series of interviews with
prominent business men and in-
dustrial leaders and authorities
in the Pittsburgh district regard-
ing economic affairs. The third.
will appear in an early issue.

By Jack Bunker.
Bargains, the woman's dream, and
the married woman's diversion, are

ness slump and retarding an early re-
covery for business, believes Ralph
W. Leavenworth, advertising manager
of the Westinghouse Electric and Man-
ufacturing Company. Mr. Leaven-
worth, who in his college days was
editor of the school paper, a11d later
became YMCA secretary, and subse-
quently advertising manager of sev-
eral companies before he came to the
Westinghouse, says: “Proﬁt in sell-
ing is now almost entirely forgotten,
the emphasis being placed on bar-
gains. The most encouraging sign for
returning good times now would be
an upturn in prices. People would
then have a return or conﬁdence and
would buy.”

“Without advertising,” Mr. Leaven-
worth says of his particular ﬁeld,
“there would be no mass production.
Advertising causes people to want and
buy the better things in life, and
thereby raises the standard of living.
Were it not for this phase of business,
cars, refrigerators, fans, toasters and
other things which we now call ne-
cessities», would be priced beyond the
reach of almost all of us.”

Mr. Leavenworth believes that ad-
vertising is a means, and a good
means, of arousing business from its
‘lethargy, because it can create new
demands, open new ﬁelds, and give
rise to greater production with its
far-reaching effects. As to the ad-

‘Craig’s Wife’
Cast Selected

Carl’ Cass chooses; ’ niorctny‘
Kaufman for Title‘ Role

After competing in a second try-
out held by Carl Cass, director of Pitt
Players, Dorothy Kaufmann, a fresh-
man in the college, has been assigned
to the title role of Mrs. Craig in the
Players’ second major production of
the year, “Craig’s Wife.” The play by
the popular playwright, George Kelly,
will -beproduced on February 16. Re-
hearsals will begin immediately after
the holidays.

As “Billy Birkmire,” the “friend in
need,” Mr. Cass has selected Joseph
Sampson, Ed. ’35. Samuel Moyer, Col.
’35, will take the part of “Harry,” per-
sonal represenative of “Tielens,”
down at headquarters.

Ruth Drum, Col. ’34, has been cast
in the character part of Mrs. Frazier,
a quiet little widow from across the
street, who complicates the plot by
doing absolutely nothing in a most
effective way. Fern Wolf, Ed. ’35, will
be the all-suffering housekeeper, Mrs.
Harold, and Helen Bart, Col. '36, as
“Mazie,” will “keep traipsing up and
down the front stairs until the paint
is all worn off,” and this much to the
annoya.nce of Mrs. Craig.

Mr, Cass has chosen Samuel Moyer
to be the assistant director of the pro-
duction.

Students Defy Gales
As Storm Barrier
Is Built

Zoology majors, engineers, and
members of the Owl staff won’t
freeze waiting for elevators on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral
any more. For, as “megasoma
eleplius” keeps the zoology stu-
dent unmindful of the wintry
blasts, workmen have been busily
erecting the long-awaited storm
barrier at the Cathedral. And it
will be ﬁnished before we leave
for our Christmas holidays, an-
nounced Mr. McClean of the de-
partment of buildings and
grounds.

So, if a stray piece of wood
happens to fall while you’re wait-

. ing for Ed’s elevator to take you
heavenward, remember that
Washington, too, crossed the Del-
aware in a snow storm!

No, I Didn’t Kiii Cock-Robin.’

 

Or So Claims the Defendant in Chemical Engineering
Trial as Audience Looks on and Hisses, “You Dog!”

 

By Charles B. Holstein

“You killed Cock Robin!

(Or was it .this man's brother he

killed?) Anyway, you killed him!”
The attorney pointed an accusing ﬁnger at the obviously cring-

ing defendent, and continued with his denunciation.

(There were

no queries of “Vas you dere, Chollyf”)

But in the trial that took place yesterday morning in the regu-
lar weekly seminar meeting of the student branch of the American

Institute of Chemical
there were few verbal explosions and
sensationalisms such as city newspa-
pers are fond of.

John Doe was bringing suit in a
civil court against the Blank Blank
(not blankety-blank) Railroad for an
indeﬁnite sum for the death of John
Doe's brother because of carbon mon-
oxide poison, alleged to have origin-
ated through the property of the rail-
road.

No judge and no jury sat in on yes-
terday’s trial; there was also no
cross-examination made and no deci-
sion handed down. For the AIChE,
according to John Kamenar, presi-
dent, has reserved the Thursday after
the vacation period to go all through
that. At that time, a judge and jury
will hear ﬁnal cross-examination of
witnesses  -and the summing-up
speeches of the four attorneys in the
case, and will then decide whether
John Doe's brother was (1) worth
even an indeﬁnite sum to John Doe;
(2) killed because of carbon monox-
ide poisoning; (3) killed because of
carbon monoxide poison that the
Blankety-Blank-oop, the Blank Blank
Railroad should have been more care-
ful of.

The plaintiﬁ's cohorts formed a de-
cidedly senior group yesterday, while
the defendant and his retinue of at-
torneys, expert witnesses, and water
boys areall ‘from’ the "34’ chemical
engineering class.

John Dewitt and Lawrence Shick
were attorneys for the plaintiff, while
Julian Phelps gave expert testimony
as a technical witness that supported
the plaintiff's case. On the side of
the defendant, John Cochran (busi-
ness of hissing “the dog!"), were two
expert witnesses, J. Mattlau and Jo-
seph Ballas, and only one attorney, J.
Emerson.

men were already there before them,¢

and were being well protected from
not only the weather, but the entire
outside world and its sins.

“Behind the Prison Door”

So our Pitt explorers, immediately
upon entering. took the pen in hand.
Today they have something to write
home about. A wonderful book on
the subject, “Behind the Prison Door,"
certainly would let down the gates.

Prisoners in the institution, the
students found, have a regimen which
would do credit to a university stu-
dent. Perhaps the most appealing
feature of the place is that famous
slogan, “A radio in every room.” From
5:30 unti1 7:30 each evening, the visi-
tors were told, the sets are allowed to
go full blast. And from 7:30 until 10,
the men read in their cells. A prison
library of 11,000 volumes furnishes
2,500 books a. month to the inmates.

There is a recreation ﬁeld within the
walls where footbatt, basketball, and
baseball are played. All ﬂy balls over
the fence are allowed to stay there.
The umpires can't afford to lose a
good outﬁelder. And even after the
greatest football victory, the winning
fans, it is said, didn’t go off with the
goal posts.

Workshops Are Maintained

Workshops are maintained at the
prison by the State Welfare Depart-
ment. There, everything from license
plates -to collar buttons is manufac-
tured. The barber “on the outside”
becomes a barber again, but the pro-
fessional thief usually givcs up his
trade in the face of great competi-
tion.

The students left after an hour and
a. half visit, murmuring, “Sorry we
couldn’-t stay longer.” The guards,
know all the answers, replied, “So
long. See you some more.”

In the afternoon, the human rela-
tions group visited the county jail.
The only feature there was a delicate-
ly tinted brick solitary conﬁnement
cell, bare of woodwork and furnish-
ings. The lone ornament was a» heavy
oak barred door. It is rumored that.
news guests in the chamber ask for!
another room with outside view. 

Leader Urges 
Business Life;

(Continued From Page One.) g
vertising business being improved in‘
regard to ethical principles, ’lfe" said,§
"Advertising is now ‘cleaning house,’j
it is being forced to accept higher.
ethical standards. Too, it is growing
up, paying its way and justifying it-
self.” ‘

-The young college man who is try-
ing to decide what to be, or trying to
earn dividends on the college invest-
ment. can glean a ray of hope from
the fact that Mr. Leavenworth con-
siders advertising a ﬁeld for college
men; college men who have a ﬂare
for writing, some sales sense, and
understand human nature.

From the subject of college men in
advertising, Mr. Leavenworth became
sidetracked on a “favorite” subject.
“Why is it?” he asked, “that the aver-
age college graduate, poured out into
the business world, doesn‘t‘know how
to write and express liimself in the
‘king's English.’ ” Joe College, in the
opinion of Mr. Leavenworth, should
learn, at some time while he is matric-
ulating at dear old Wishwash, to ex-
press his thoughts simply and quickly.

For the young couples, who are
worrying about meeting the ﬁrst in-
stallment on the twin beds, we have
a little cheerful Yuletide news. Mr.
Leavenworth believes that We have
undoubtedly reached the bottom and
that normal times, when you buy a
pound of weiners without asking the
price, are not far off——two years at
the most!

Students Study Conveyor
Near Brownsville, Penna.

 

The students of the department of
mining under the direction of Profes-
sor Robert Black, head of the depart-
ment, made. a trip Friday to the
Colonial No. 3 mine of the A. C.
Frick Coke Company located near
Brownsville.

The trip had a twofold purpose:
ﬁrst, to study the conveyor that is
used here to take the place of the
usual tracks and locomotives. The
conveyor which brings the coal out
to the river is the longest one in use,
being over four miles long. The sec-
ond object was to study the -‘system
of coal mining that is employed in
the coke regions.

Professor Black is planning many
more trips for the department, but
ﬁnds difficulty because most of the
plants only work a few days a week.

Electrical Engineers Leave
Short Circuits; Throw

Yuletide Blowout

With Fred Reiber, '33, as mas-
ter of ceremonies a.nd the famous
EE twelve-piece orchestra. under
Jones’ spasmodically adding mel-
ody to the affair, the electrical
engineering undergrads did away
with their regular weekly seminar
meeting yesterday to throw a. big
Christmas party on the main ﬂoor
of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial Hall.

While the musical electricians
played “Let's Burn Out the
Lights and Get a Job,” and a.
quartet of husky spark-plug test-
ers put in a little vocal harmony
of the beer-garden variety, the
EE’s romped and played and pre-
tended they were back in M,cKees
Rocks or Plottsburg in the good
old days when Santa. was syn-
onymous with toys and candy and
electric trains; not a Democrat,
a "jackass, a stein of beer, and
debt payments.

The senior class members lined
up under the imposing Gettysburg
Address and presented a. skit as
once did you or I~—back in,.fourth
grade.

.“Sure, it was a swell party," put
in a future successor of Edison
as the affair broke up. “But,
gees, where are the eats? I never
thought I’d go to a party and not
get my face fed.” The orchestra
concluded with “Yes, We Have
No Bananas."

Lytton Report Declared
Historically Important

——--

“The Lytton report is the attempt
of the present world order to prevent
its »:own destruction by war,” declared
Dr, Ben H. VVilliams, professor of po-
litical science, in his address before
Forum Wednesday at
12:30 o'clock. Dr. Williams, using
the Lytton report as his subject,
traced the latest developments in the
Manchurian controversy.

According to the speaker,- the re-
port is the most imporfent one ever
rendered in an international contro-
versy. It involves the tirst,'nsta.nce
of a great nation being brought for
trial before an international tribunal.
He, further stated that the world is
so'J-idly, though not aggressively,
against Japan in the aﬁair. W

Detailing the recommendations of
the Lytton committee, appointed by
the League of Nations to investigate
the situation, Dr. ‘Williams pointed
out that a conference attended by
bo_th interested and neutral nations is
advised. “According to the Commit-
tee,” he said, “Manchukuo should not
be: recognized as a nation by any
member of the League. The armed
Japanese troops in l\/Ianchuria, under
whom banditry has increased, should
they say, be replaced by native police
forces.” ”'

Dr. Vvilliams was
seven weeks last summer, where he
studied international problems facing
the League.

Metallurgy Classes Visit
Jones and Laughlin Co.

The students and faculty of the de-
partment of metallurgy visited the
blast furnace department of the Jones
and Laughlin Steel company;Tuesday
afternoon, Dr. Stephen L. —Goodale,
head of the department of metallurgy,
and Dr. Milo J. Stutzman, nietalurgy
instructor, arranged the trip. Many
of the students climbed on top of the
idle furnaces so that they could study
the exterior parts and maclliinery.

The class in oil well drilling and
pumping of the oil and gas depart-
ment, taught by Dr. Ionel 1.‘, Gardes-
cue. assistant professor of oil and gas
production, made ﬁeld trips to Oil
City on Thursday, Friday and Satur-
day, to study methods of drilling and
pumping employed there.

WAA Arranges Classes

ing classes under the managership
of Charlotte Mady, Ed. ’33. Tap danc-
ing, ballet, natural dancing and acro-
batic as well as social dancing will

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16,1932

 

The Golden Panthers will begin their trek westward toward
-their third crack at the Tournament of the Roses bouquets, leaving
Pittsburgh Sunday evening over a Pennsylvania Railroad flyer to-

ward St. Louis at 11:20.

After a short stop in St. Louis and a change of railroads, the
team will head south to Dallas, Texas, where a short workout is
scheduled for the boys on the Southern Methodist University cam-

.K
7

-pus Tuesday afternoon.

A Missouri-Paciﬁc express will
‘leave the boys at Tucson, Arizona,
the headquarters of Dr. Sutherland’s
proteges for the next nine days.
Here a training camp is to be set up
for the Panthers where daily work-
outs will be indulged in until Decem-
‘ber 31. The boys break camp that
afternoon, and arrive in Pasadena,
the scene of the Roses game, Sunday
morning. After a short workout in
the Rose Bowl, the team will rest
until shortly before Monday after-
noon's gridiron struggle.

See Grand Canyon

The return schedule as announced
yesterday afternoon, calls for the de-
parture of the Panthers from Pasa-
dena, Wednesday afternoon, January
4. The following day will be spent
viewing- the Grand Canyon. The boys
boardthe train that evening and head
south to Alburquerque, New Mexico,
where another day of sightseeing is
in store for the team.

From Alburquerque the return trip
takes the gridders to Kansas City, to
Chicago, and to Pittsburgh, arriving
home early Sunday evening, January
8.

So it’s another try at a victory in
Rose Bowl competition for the Pan-
thers. Losing in 1927 to Stanford 7-6,
and again in 1930 to Southern Cali-
fornia 47-14, the Panthers will tackle
the Trojans fer a third ‘attempt at a
victory.

Panther Chances Slim
At the present time the outlook is

very dark that the Panthers will eke
out a. victory. With the defeat Satur-
day of the Irish at the hands of How-
ard Jones” Trojans, the stock of the
Panthers fell like some of those on
the stock market in 1929. But strange
as it seems, Dr. Sutherland likes his
stock in such a position. An easy
victory provides no thrills for any of
his teams, while an unexpected vic-
tory shows just how much power the
Panthens really have.

Although illness has thinned the
ranks of the ﬁrst string varsity dur-
ing the past week, it is expected that
the ailing ones will all be in shape
when the "whistle ‘blows at "2 o'clock
on the Monday afternoon of January
2. Captain Paul Reider, whose leg
has caused his absence during the
major part of the season just closed,
will have entirely recovered from the
effects of his injury in the Ohio
Northern game last September. Joe
Tormey, whose attack of inﬂuenza
has caused his absence from practice
during the past week, will be in shape
when the train pulls out of the Union
Station, Sunday night.

U. S. C. Averages 193 Pounds

The Panthers stack up against a
team whose line and backﬁeld average
is 193 pounds, and whose especial
line of attack is through the air. This
year the Panthers ,have been-quite
successful in snagging passes of their
opponents, snaring 22 during the sea-
son, one of which added to the in-
dignity of the Irish when Daily ran
38 yards on an intercepted Ix‘:-tmbler
pass. On the same side of the pic-
ture the Panthers gained 521 yards
on 33 completed passes of 86 tried,
while their opponents gained but 718
yards on 50 of 150 passes tried during
the ten-game season.

Panthers Can’t Convert

The Panthers’ weak spot during the
recent season was kicking after
touchdown goals, the boys completing
14 and missing a. like number . . . a
little matter that kept the fans on the
edge of their seats during the course
of three games——Army, Pennsylvania,
and Carnegie Tech. But the good
Doctor has set about correcting that
fault, making that a major part of his
practices.

But one thing is certain, the boys
remember that 47-14 drubbing of two

years ago, and although the Panthers  m

are not con-ceded a chance to take
the Southern California game, no one
can be found willing to predict a
score even resembling that last one.

BITS   -3-

Having been selected on two more
All-American teams over the week-
end, Warren Heller ran his total num-
ber of selections up to mhpf. This is
exactly mhpf times more than any
other candidate.

Heller was named on the All-
American picked by the All-Amer-
ican Board, 'composed ‘of ‘Me1ssrs.»'
Warner, Harper, Casey, Alexan-
der and Walsh. In addition, one
of the major radio companies
placed Heller on its All-American
team. "
One of the stories that do get
around can hardly be called ordinary.
It concerns Wilson Brooks, chairman
of the Soph Hop dance and a member
of Doc Carlson’-s basketball squad.
Brooks, the player, invited Carlson,
the coach, to the dance, but the good
doctor was unable to attend. Brooks,
however, attended. (Oh, you won't
talk?)

New nicknames have appeared
in the past few days that really
need. recognition.. _ Capt. Don
Smith, of the basketball ‘ team,’
has been bestowed with the name
of “Champ,” making two champs
in Pitt. Frank Tiernan, who plays
football and wrestles in Sewick-
Iey, is the other. Jack Schrlcker,
whose idea of a good time is left-
hooking some one, is likely to
sprout the name of “Strongheart”
any day now.

Before the announcement that Pitt
had accepted the Rose Bowl bid was
made public, Johnny Luch had laid
plans for a hunting trip and an op-
eration during the Christmas holi-
days. Luch even took time to break
in a pair of knee—high hunting boots
one day.

Hunk Anderdson, in predicting
Pitt's defeat by Southern Califor-
nia on New Year's day, claims

~ that Pitt's second touchdown ,
against theilrish was a fluke. May-
be Hunk didn't see Dai|ey’s foot-
work after he intercepted the

Notre Dame pass.

Something must be done about up-
holding Pitt’s reputation as a football
team par excellence. Weeks have
passed since the good old VVNU is-
sued a challenge and nothing has been
done about it!

So much argument has arisen
concerning the meaning of “punch
drunk” that an attempt will be
made_here to explain it. First of
all, any one can become “punch-
drunk” or “slug-nutty" if you
prefer. V

‘ Both of these'~characteristics can
be determined by noting the actions
of the individual. If he, or she, walks
on his heels and tips his hat to tele-
graph poles, he's “it.” Complaining
of buzzing noises in the ears and pick- '
ing All-American teams are also re-
garded as Class A symptoms.

This condition is caused by too

the dive, losing to Carik.

Lebedda put on a thrilling last‘
length sprint to beat out Warren and'
Cogswell of the varsity to win the
440-yard freestyle in 5:40. Jack
Denny Won the 100 in :56.1 and ﬁn-

ished second behind Lindberg in the

Dr. William J. Holland

EW persons could pass from this world and leave behind as great

a sense of irreparable loss as that felt in Pittsburgh today on tl1e
death of Dr. William Jacob Holland. _
His contributions to the University, to the city he was proud to
call his home, and to the world at large are known to all. The rec-
ord of his achievement in every phase of a life devoted to something
inﬁnitely ﬁner than mere public service is partly told in the positions

held by the institutions that felt his inﬂuence.

The greater record

is told in the unspoken tributes of his fellow beings, those with whom
he sought to share the joys of a life complete.

VVe who knew him, perhaps too slightly, feel his passing as a
loss which neither time nor a changing world can ever entirely

erase.

Panther Send-Cit!

LESS than two weeks ago, Student Council rejected a proposal
' that a mass pep meeting of resident students be held in the
Union depot the night of the football team’s departure for Califor-
nia. Placing their conﬁdence in the individual students, members of
Council argued that it would be unnecessary to “call’i a meeting;
they were sure We would be there without any official prodding.

The team leaves shortly before midnight Sunday. They’re a
modest lot, these boys of Dr. Sutherland’s, not so much concerned
over public acclaim as they are over accomplishing the object of
their trip. ‘Already some intimations of group opinion on the mat-
ter of a “send-oﬂ” has trickled through from the squad. “They gave
us a send-oﬁ in 1930, and look what followed us home,” has been the
trend of the expressions we have heard. -

But that attitude is not hard to understand. Pitt hasn’t pro-

duced any “rah—rah” grandstand teams for some time.

Like their

coach, the players accept their victories and defeats with a marked
degree of calmness. They have been weaned away from things asso-
ciated with “pep,” but in the process have gained something more
fundamentally important, something they may yet impart to us-

“spirit.”

Perhaps we, as a group, need them more than they need us.
Our being in the train shed of the Union depot Sunday night will

not assure another football victory; that, at best, would be a shallow ,

aim. Any demonstration in the nature of a “send—oﬁ’” for the team
will have been worth the eﬁiort if it does no more than to strengthen
the spirit revealed at last month ’s testimonial assembly.

When The Lights Went Out

 

It Mazda Been a Terrible Experience Says Member of
Dr. Turner’s Survey History Glass

 

Freshmen in Survey History are working upon a new outside

assignment.

For the best answer to, “Where were you when the

lights went out?” a prize of ten mores, two customs, and three
laws will be given by Dr. Ralph E. Turner, associate professor. And

thereby hangs a tale.

“Mores are social forces the brea.king
of which makes the breaker of which
ashamed—of which.” As he brought
down his ﬁst to emphasize the point,
the lights went out with a ﬂash.

But the students took the matter
philosophically. As one of them
gazed about the half-darkened bowl,
he was heard to remark, “Oh, it’s
just a ﬂash in the pan.”

“Trying to make light of it, hm ”

platform, unmoved. The fact is, he

golden opportunity to say, “Ah, voids,

The sun burned with envy when
the lights reappeared. Robert Mc-

One is continually reminded of the
literary possibilities in early Ameri-
can civilizations. It has been only a
few years since expeditions ﬁrst

beauty and splendor of Aztec cul-
ture, since Lindbergh watched the
half-buried nccropolises of the Mayas
unro.l1 across Yucatan. Yet in that
time an amazing amount of interest
has grown con-cerning‘ the people who

held -the continents before us. A num-
ber of creators have been aware of
artistic materials among the In-
dians.: Even our northern In-d-ians,
though leaving few remains, have been
caught in the romance of “The Last
of the Mohicans,” “Hiawatha,” and-
other works.

Fifty years ago the composer, Mac-
Dowell, was urging Americans to
utilize Indian melodies; so did Dvor-
ak, though a foreigner; and it is no
more chance that some of the best
compositions of both were based on
American themes, ‘

Aztec Possibilities Greatest

In the romance of Maya, Peru and
Aztec, however, the artistic posibil-
ities are greatest. For here we have,
not a few dying legends, a half-for-
gotten melody or so, but all the rich
tales of Montezuma and the Seven
Golden Cities of the West alive in
stone-. Here the Fountain of Youth
becomes almost plausible and one
rather thinks of Ponce de -‘Leon as
not such a fool after all.

Of course, there are any number
who say: “This isn’t an age of ro-
mance, but facts, and what relation
has Montezuma to our own.acute
problems?” Years ago we should

‘probably have had to answer, none.

But it is signiﬁcant now that one of
the ﬁnest poems of recent years, and
one of the most intense and full ex-
pressions of modern dissolution and
break-down was written by an Amer-
ican on the story of Cortez’s con-
quest.
Conquistador Brings Memories

Conquistador is a. tale told by an
old man “in a dry season.” It is the
story of youth lost, glory -and hero-
ism vanished, of a land replete with
peace and. the security of beauty
brought eventually to ashes. Mac-
Leish follows pretty closely the ac-
count in the “True History of the
Conquest of New Spain,” by Be-rnal
Diaz de Castillo. We experience the

sharp struggle of Cortez and his men
for the fabulous cities, their sudden
coming upon them in the warm, fer-
tile valleys of Tenochtitlan and the
blessed days that follow.

“VVe were like those that in their

lands they say

uncovered temples that revealed the,

The steers of the sun went up through
the wave-lit orchards

Shaking the waterdrops and those
gold: naked

Girls before them at their dripping
horns!

And they ate the sea-doused ﬁgs with
the salt taste:

And all their time was of kine and of
sea and of morning.”

Then came the fatal mistake, the
repulse, the turbulent retreat. The
conquerors return in the spring and
devastate the whole land, and build
themselves a city upon the ruins, and
the old gives" place to the new and
the beauty is gone. So it seems to an
old- man looking back . . .

“sickened and near death:
0 day that brings the earth back
bring again
That well-ewept town, those towers
and that island. . .”
Poem of Great Depth.

Conquistador is more than a tale
of conquest. It is a poem of amaz-
ing beauty and depth, and more than
any other “modern poem, in such a
singular, intense way sums up the
philosophy of our attitude, We stand
in a world that is stark and new,
having succeeded the old, yet the
yearning of the old is still upon us
and little satisfaction remains, and
‘beauty seems to diminish. Probably
MacLeish’—s attitude may seem pes-
simistic in too strenuous a degree to
some of us. But the essential truth
is there, for often -there are those
empty times, when all that seems
left is . . . sky.
