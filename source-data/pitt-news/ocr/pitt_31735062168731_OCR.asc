UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

' Dr. Thomas Altizer

Airs Current Ideas
   In Christian Theology

by BERNI McLEOD
Dr. Thomas J. J. Altizer, introduced as “one of the most
creative theological voices in America today,” spoke yester-
day at noon in the SU Ballroom on “The Shape of Radical

Theology.”

As the keynote speaker for the University Chaplains
Association series on Religion and Culture, Dr. Altizer, pro-

fessor of Bible and religion at
Emory University, limited him-
self to discussing radical Protes-
tant theology. He called it not a
betrayal of faith, but a consistent '
and organized movement in an
ever evolving Christian faith.
Modern Protestant theology, in
Dr. Altizer’s opinion, is actually
conservative and in large meas-
ure, revolts against the modern
world. What has resulted is a
form of theology that could make
faith real in an unbelieving world.
Dr. Altizer outlined three mo-
tifs or currents relative to the
movement. The ﬁrst involves a.

phical understanding of God. It
means understanding God as he
is disclosed in Christ. “since the
fullness of God is present in
Christ,” said Dr. Altizer, “the
Christo-centric approach to reli-
gion helps people understand God
as a God of faith.”

The second motif is the chang-
ing of traditional theological lan—_
guage to a more modern and.
meaningful form. “Most Chris-
tians ﬁnd themselves unable to
speak the ancient language of
the Church,” said Dr. Altizer. “It
seems dark and unreal.” They
ﬁnd faith most meaningful, he
explained, when it is not shared
in ancient terms.

The union of a transcendental

logy. “The Eastern Christian re-
ligions,” explained Dr. Altizer,
“have always had the sense of
union betwen the heavenly, other
worldly qualities of God, and the
God that is here and now. This
has been lost in the West, where

Central Catholic High School
of Pittsburgh outdebated 68 other
teams from 17 states to win first
place in the William Pitt Invita-
tional Debate Tournament held
this past weekend at the Univer-
sity. _ _

Central, coached by Brother
Gregory Rene, edged out Melrose
High School of Melrose, Mass., by
a 43 score in the ﬁnal round held
Sunday afternoon. 4

Central Catholic eliminated
Canton Lehman High School of
Canton, Ohio, in a semi-ﬁnial
round to gain a berth in the
ﬁnals, while Melrose defeated
Taylor Allderdice in the other
semi-final round.

  
   

   

these qualities have been kept
separate.

Dr. Altizer feels that in es-
sence, all the motifs are one. All
represent a. gradual development
of Christian theology, he explain-
ed, where God will be under-
stood and celebrated in human
terms. This movement lies be-
hind the Death of God theology,
which repudiates both giving wit-
ness to God -apart from Christ"
and the ancient religious term-
inologies.

“Christianity must be accepted
asian organic, developing "reli-
gidn,” he continued. “Radical
theology is not radical, but con-
sists of an organic movement that
has been going on since the very

beginnings of the religion.”

Freshman Council Reports
On Student Apathy,Disunity

Students blamed campus apathy on the tight trimester
schedule, but planned to attend at least five University
sports events during the Winter trimester, a recent Men’s
Freshman Council political survey of nearly 1000 students

revealed.

' Contacted in the dormitories, Student Union lobby, and

the Cathedral Commons Room,
students were polled on student

apathy, the new dormitories, late _
registration fee, the Student -

Union, and University events, Po-

litical Survey, Chairman Victor,

Willem reported.

Students attribute indifference
to University activities not only
to the heavy academic load pro-
duced by the trimester schedule
but to losing sports teams and
an “ineffective Student Govern-
ment (SG), the survey revealed.

Alternatively, approximately 63
per cent of the undergraduates
polled said they planned to at-
tend the ﬁve major sports events
or felt that they had enough time
to work on one SG event such
as Homecoming.

A similar 63 per cent was un-

aware of the disbursements made ‘

by the Allocations Committee but-
felt that SG

. .;2..

should comment on _
inetionel   a ten ese ta» ’

     

tive of the student body.

Tabulations revealed that 55
per cent of those queried were
against remodeling the Student
Union and 57 per" cent were
against razing the present Union
and constructing a new one. In
addition, 65 per cent were against
ﬁnancing the new building by a
student fee.

Although students, seemed hos-
tile to the dormitories to be
built behind Panther Stadium,
they offered suggestions such as
“provision of adequate,‘ fast and
continuous transportation” and
coordination of activities between
Towers and hill residents to pre-
vent campus disunity and effec-
tive police protection.

According to Willem, students

important feature in the Consti-
tution as the University Review
Board, which, he’ said, will en-
able “you and I to appeal deci-
sions of administrators.”
Debating Ruskay, Meisner de-
clared, “I came here tonight to-
clear the air on a few issues that
have been raised.” He questioned

  

 

» _t/,_

 
 

the claim that there is a “crisis” 
at the University, pointing to the 
situation one year ago when the ' '

University had a $19 million debt‘

-and the chancellor was fatally
stricken with a. heart attack. Meis-
ner pointed to the current sit-
uation, with the University “now
in the black” and the recent se-
lection of a new chancellor. “The

. crisis is over,” he emphasized.

Ruskay lated emphasized, “For
the ﬁrst time in the University,
students will be involved in the
decision-making process itself..

Ruskay bemoaned the fact that
“once a year students go and
stimulate discussion” and urged
everyone to vote Monday, for
“only then will we build a SG
together.” I

Meisner remarked that people
are asking where the student".

leaders are. “The student lead-
ers have been working this past
year,” he replied. He cited the
promise of a new Student Union
and the likelihood that “the out-

of-state fee will be dropped” to .

illustrate his point. He announced
that these accomplishments were
“not the result of backing some-
one against -the wall. Things have
been done this year ' where it
counts,” Meisner said, “with the

People who are making the de- 0‘

cisions. . . . _
“When you consider the can-

didates this year, look closely at _-

their qualiﬁcations,” Meisner

stated. “Note the experience pre- 7 

sent in certain people. It is easy

‘ to cause a confrontation, but it

is much harder to sit down and
work things out.” I

A WASHINGTON, D. C. (CPS)-

E’ The Peace Corps has received
applications from 2.5 per cent of
the senior classes at more than
250 colleges this fall——the highest
percentage in the agency’s his-
tory. Director Jack Vaughn said
that applications increased over
last year at 213 of the 263 schools
visited since September.

“Not only are we getting vol-
unters to meet increasing re-
quests from overseas,” Vaughn
said, “I think we are getting bet-
ter men and women.” Peace
Corps official Kevin Lowther,
said that the war in Vietnam “has

« had no noticeable effect” on the
number of applications. L.owther
pointed out that the male-female
ratio among applicants is hold-
ing to the 60-40 level of past
years.

Although Peace Corps officials
expect a drop in total number of
applicants next year, Lowther
said the ﬁve-year-old agency dis-
courages applications from fresh-
men and sophomores.

Only two volunteers have been
drafted during their service. in
the Peace Corps and an esti-
mated 150 have been inducted
after their Peace Corps service.
