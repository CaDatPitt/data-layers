Phi Kappa fraternity will have
until Oct. 31 to present additional
defense testimony in the re—opened
-case of Henry K. Kirk-Patrick and
W. Hayden Wilson‘vs. the fraternity
men. 5

Last Friday a new hearing was
scheduled at which Hampton Hall
Apartments, Inc. entered the line-
up as a plaintiff against the Phi
Kaps. 7

Hampton Hall is located next to
the Phi Kappa fraternity house. Wil-
son and Kirk-Patrick are second-
floor residents of the apartments.

The initial hearings between the
Phi Kaps -and their neighbors were
held on Oct. 4 and 5. At that time
attorney Ella Graubart, representing
Wilson and Kirk-Patrick, attempted
to have the court issue aninjunc—
tion against the Phi Kaps to prevent
them from parking automobiles in
their back yard.

Preliminary papers served on the
Phi Kaps mentioned petting, drink-
ing, and boisterous racket going on
in the rear of the Phi Kap house.
When the case reached the court,
however, the sensational angles of
the injunction proceedings were"
battle centered
around the much-maligned parking
lot.

In the present proceedings Ham-
pton Hall, Inc. wants .to.enter the
case on the side of Wilson and Kirk-
Patrick and to show that tenents
residing in the building have been
disturbed. Last Friday two tenants
of the building testified to that
effect before Judge Thompson.

Of the new hearing Phi Kap attor-
ney said, "We don’t feel that there
is any issue. The case doesn’t need
any further testimony on our part.”

A ‘He added in stronger terms, “The

case’ doesn’t warrant a court in
equity.” 7

The case of the apartment house
waspresented by attorney Ella Gran-
‘bart. Hampton Hall retains its own
attorney, but at the Friday hearing
he appeared only as a consultant.

Near the close of the one-hour
hearing, Miss Graubart asked that
Jarvis furnish the court with a list
of all Phi Kaps and Phi‘Kap alumni
that visit the fraternity house.» The
hearing closed on this note.

It appears that Judge Thompson
will not hand down a decision on
the case for at least a month. The
rival attorneys have not yet filed
briefs; and transcriptions of the
testimony have not been concluded.

Book Store
Nets Profit

Men’s Council's Book Store has
showed a profit of almost $400 in
the three weeks of its operations
_this Fall. This money is used to
finance Men's Council Loan Fund.

Robert Liridner, manager, reported
that the total volume of ‘business
amounted to $2,251.75. Of this,
$385.45 was profit. Approximately
1000 books were sold.

The book store does not buy
books from the student and then sell
them to another student. It acts,
however, as a "middleman” selling
the book for the student. Fifteen
percent of the selling price is re-
tained by Copncil to ‘meet the ex-
penses of hired, help, advertising,
and miscellaneous items.

The store was open this semester
from Sept. 19 until Oct. 7. The store
will again be open for three weeks
next February.

« Lindner stressed that the store
acts as a “supplement” rather than
as 5a competitor of the University
‘Book Store. "Its purpose is not a

Co-chairmen of the speakers di-
vision, Andy Schurman and Janet
O’Hagan, emphasize the point that
only a brief introductory talk will
be necessary this year becauseof
the short class time allowed.
Contributions will be taken by

hours, Nov. 2.

Thosfpersons who volunteer to
to speak are requested to visit Mrs.
Yakish in the Dean of Men’s Office
at their earliest convenience.'Mem-
bers of campus religious organiza-
tions in particular are asked to help
with this campaign.

Fund Drive speakers will gather
at a box luncheon to be served by
YWCA girls at 12:30 p.m. on Thurs-
day, Oct. 27, in the Stephen Foster
Memorial.

A movie explaining the activities
of agencies included in the Fund
Drive will be shown and Dr. Demas
Barnes, of the history department,
will speak on the subject.

The amount being asked] in the
present drive is two dollars per
student as in the Spring drive last
year. The total contributions must
be distributed among almost 100
organizations.

Eight major agencies represented
are the Community Chest, Men’s
Loan Fund, Women’s lloan Fund,
Red Cross, March of Dimes, CARE
and the United Negro College Fund.

PREPARING FOR BIG EVENT--Andy Schurman, who always likes
to be in the swim, is in training for C Day. Andy: who has figured out
that C Day means Channel Day, dons his swimming trunks and goggles
regularly to work out.

Chest Committee Seeks
Speakers For Drive

Students already holding tickets
should c.ontact the Student Desk
tomorrow to see if the quota has
been reached.

A one-way ticket to Philadelphia
at regular price costs $2 more than
the entire round trip under the uni-
versity plan. Game tickets cost
$3.90. .

A handbill circulated by the Sun-
Telegraph mistakenly stated that
the $10.35 will include a tour and
dinner. The school’s program is
entirely separate from the Sun-Tele
sponsored trip.

Extras Thrown In

Extras) thrown in by the railroad
include a rally at Pennsy Station,
andiprivate cars for students who
want them. Student Congress ad-
visor, William Saalbach, said that

then decided to finish up together
on Friday, Oct. 21. They hoped that
the extension would bring in more
students.

During the first week of the cam-

paign almost 200 males had taken
the test. There were no female takers
then, however.

The “purpose of the test was to
discover if the student’s urine has
a sugar content. While this is not
always a positive indication of di-
abetes, all diabetics show this
characteristic.

The advantage in discovering
diabetes for Pitt students is. that
insulin treatments, when started at
an early age, can better relieve the
effects of diabetes, such as harden-
ing of the arteries, eye complaints,
and kidney trouble.

Very often overweight people can
be cured by dietary" methods alone.

The American Diabetes Associ-
ation estimates that there are ap-
proximately 1,000,000 unknown dia-
betics in the U.S. This figure was
arrived at using the percentage fig-
ures of a New England doctor who

tested his entire town.

Fighting polio is a costly project.

In 14 years that the Allegheny chap-

ter has been functioning, $400,000

has been expended for hospitaliza-V
tion, medical expenses, nursing,

after acute stage convalescence,

equipment and surgical operations.

One case alone of a Pittsburgh

boy, 17, stricken in 1942 While

visiting Florida, has to'date cost

the local chapter expenditures of

approximately $20,000 including

transportation from Florida in an

iron lung, and-continuation of treat-
ment in Children's Hospital.

High costs do not only occur in
pulmonary polio. An operation known
as ‘spinal fusion, used to counter-
act spinal curvature caused by the
disease, requires eight weeks hos-
pitalization and involves an ex-
pense of $1,600. Another expensive
therapy is being employed called
nerve regeneration. It consists of
the pulping or breaking-down of
nerve ends which may then regrow
by natural process and give normal
life “to paralyzed arms or legs.

The entire organization conduct-

'ing this work is composed of vol-

untary workers; no adminstrative
salaries or office rentals are paid.
In the last ten years the localchap-
ter has functioned_with a minimum
of administrative expense of a small
fraction of one per cent. ,l

. None of this work is possible, how-
ever, without your contributions to
defer. the numerous expenses in-
curred in the actual treatment of
polio. The amount you give deter-
mines the extent to which willing
volunteer workers can function in
the fight to eradicate this terrible
disease. A ‘

versive’ element known in acti-
vities circles as the ‘Filthy Five’-
and dragging along such arch-con-
servatives as Dave Fox and Dario

strative shackles from the limbs of
its constituents.

Beginning with last Monday’s
stormy session at which the Five
and their backers protested thatqthe
Board of Deans hadigranted them too
little time to hold projected pep
rallies and victory celebrations, the
‘Buck the Deans’ movement gained
momentum and culminated in an
equally stormy meeting of a sort of‘
rump session of Congress following
Tuesday’s Counselor—Mentor Ban-
quet. ‘
About a dozen students, half of

representing various campus fields
and activities, hashed over the
deans’ action and the various stu-
dent counter—proposals, which ranged
from placid acceptance to outright
defiance /of the rally time grant.

In between the two. extremes,
several ideas bear mentioning.

The most logical, from the writ-
ers point of view, was that the let-

possibly was colored by the intent,
to make the issue a test case in
Congress-administration relations. I
As such, the proponents may~have
something there.

Student Congress members have
Irarely, if ever, even protestekd an
administration ruling, A regardless of
the feelings of their supposed con-'
stituents, the student body, on the
the subject. While abject submission
to one’s elders is admirable. in its
modesty, it could be that the ad-
ministration would be willigg to
grant a little more authority to Con-
gress and give students a bigger
voice in matters of University policy
that vitally concern them if Con-
gress or some "more militant student
representative group were to \stand
up and ask for such authority.‘

The present ‘bubbling in Congress
may be no more than another case of
excessive hot air. Again, it could
be an unwise stirring up of hereto- _
fore placid waters and, through mis-
guided or foolhardy moves, lead to
an entirely unlooked-for explosion».

Wisely guided, a "movement for
better student representation could
grow from the current issue. There
courage will be required, but ce1:--

\

tainly Congress has crouched in

deans that, in the event of an'up-
set victory over Ohio State or Minne-
sota, a one-hour‘ rally inside Sol-
diers .and Sailors Memorial Hall
would be insufficient time for the
student body to expend its enthus-
iasm. It_ was generally agreed (after
the three most, adamant opponents
had left) that one more hour, during
which the band could lead a parade
through Oakland and back to the
Cathedral, would suffice. ’

It was believed that if the rally
time were scheduled between 9:30
and 11:30 a.m. Monday with the de-
finite understanding that ‘class
cuts would be levied beginning at
fourth hour, students would return
to classes with little trouble.

A Saturday night bonfire cele-
bration was proposed by one of the
embattled minority members which
also had merit. Provided enough
publicity ‘were given in advance of
and during a game, such a rally,
especially if combined with a frat-
ternity-sorority rogressive dance,

of the faculty and administration

 Free Grid Movies

Draw Large Crowds

Men’s Council’s sponsored football films are rapidly gaining
popularity on the campus. The second showing attracted 230 stu-

dents last Thursday.

This was the second in a series ‘showing Pitt’s football team

in action. Each Thursday the pre-
ceding Saturday’s game is shown.

Stephen FosterMemorialHall houses

the showings. There is a complete
show each fifth, sixth and seventh
hours.

These are the movies the Ath-
letic Department uses for studying
the team’s defects. This is the
first time that the department has
released the movies before the en-
tire, season was over.

~ Alan Goldberg, college sopho-

more, who is in charge of the show-

ings, reported a commentator could
not be secured for last Thursday’s
show. Each of the coming shows
will definitely have a commentator,
he added.

Next Thursday the Pitt-Indiana
game will be shown. 1

Wesleyan
Aids Majors

Bloomington, Ill. — (IP) - Achange
in graduation requirements which
will begin with the class of '50 has_
been instituted at Illinois Wesleyan
University. Dr. Mildred Hunt, regis-
trar, announced here‘that the re-
quirements of a “C” average, which
was formerly the rule, has been
changed to read, a "C average is
required for all work after the open-
of the semester or term in which
thestudent begins his last 90 hours.
before graduation.”

The change was specifically to
meet two needs, Dr. Hunt stated.
"First, some freshmen are slow
about college adjustments and learn-
ing proper study habits, but later
they do satisfactory college work.
Second, some students get started

in the wrong field and they too ac -'

cumulate low grades. A change of
field often justifies their continu-
ation in college.” ‘

To offset the danger of a stu-
dent’s feeling that his first year
work is not important, the number
of hours of D grade which will count
toward a degree was lowered to 24.

"The new rule, then, is a relaxing
in one case and a stiffening in the
other,” Dr. Hunt continued. “If a
student has already accumulated
more than 24 hours of D, they will

ALFRED PAYNE

MCA Gets
ew Head

By LEONARD BAKER
Alfred C. Payne, new YMCA sec-
etary, comes to Pitt with a back-
If-oundthatincludesadistinguished
arirecord and a long career in ‘Y’
vctivities. >

Mr. Payne succeeds J. Frederick
iller as the ‘Y’s’ secretary. Mr.
Miller left Pitt last Spring to work
:1 New York.
,Born in Georgia, Mr. Payne has
teadily worked his way North. He
ook his Bachelor of Science degree
t Clem son College, Sguth Carolina.
oing further, he took his Bachelor
f Divinity at Yale University.
He was with the Virginia Poly-
echnical Institute as associate
We-cretary of the YMCA since 1946.
reviously he was at the Texas
Agricultural and Mining College,
Where he served in the same capacity.
Mr. Payne took time from his ‘Y’
career to serve as an infantry cap-
tain‘ in Europe. He received the
Crouix de Guerre with Silver Star,
the Bronze Star with Oakleaf Clus-
,er, and five campaign stars.
Members of the ‘Y’ indicate that
o radical changes in the organi-
ation’s format are expected with
one exception. Mr. Paine has‘ex-
pressed his desire that leadership
‘Y’ affairs be taken from a cen-
al authority in the ‘Y’ Office and
legated to the students directly.
\ This is consistent with his poli-
iy that leadership can only be de-
veloped by actual practice.

Pitt Reverts to U derclog Role

Freshmen lConnellsville Comet--by Harper

Beat W&J
In Debut

By STANLEY SKIRBOLL

T.he Pitt freshmen inaugurated
their 1949 season Saturday by trip-
ping the Washington and Jefferson
frosh 20-0, at the Stadium before
250 fans.

Frank Guadagnino, 175-pound
fullback from Westinghouse, tallied
twice for the frosh, the first on a
15-yard dash through guard, and the
other on a two-yard line buck. War-
ren (Rabbit) Walton clinched the
game with a four-yard run with less
than two minutes left to go.

]-oe Scalzo booted two extra
points.

i Attacks Weak

Neither team was able to offer
any sort of a potent ground offense,
and nothing at all in an air attack.
Except for a few explosive runs by
Walton, the game was settled onthe
defensive work of the Pitt line. The
hard charging fofwards kept the ef-
fectiveness of the W81] T-formation
at a minimum.

Loss of their star quarterback,
Don Puglisi, early in the second
quarter because of injuries, left the
Prexies without an adequate passer
and hampered what little offensive
playthey might have shown.

Two Panther TD’s were set up by’

fumbles. Joe Machisic’s recovery
of a W81] miscue,and a 14-yard gal-
lop by the Rabbit put the ball on the
W&] 19 "in the closing minutes of
the first quarter.
Block Helps

Joe’ Capp and Tony Simile ad-
vanced the ball to the ']_.1 from which
point Guadagnino made a first
down to the. 8. A two yard loss and
an offside penalty temporarily
stalled the Blue-and-Gold offense,
but Guadagnino, with the help of a
nice block by Simile, drove over
for the first score of the game.

Pitttset up its second tally on an}
odd play. Joe Capp’s pass was in-
tercepted on the ten" by Sanford

Newman,who fumbled the ball when ‘

he was instantly hit. The ball rolled
to the two yard line, where Scalzo
finally tucked it in. S .

Walton moved the ball to theil,
but a five yard penalty nullified the
gain and set the pigskin back to
the 6. Walton immediately, brought
it up to the 2 again, with Guadagni-
no bulling it over from there.

A. blocked kick by Scalzo, who
was outstanding on defense, set up
the final Pitt score.

Side Lines--

Tony Romantino, 5 foot 9 inch
Supercharged guard from Donora,
was unable to play his first game
for Pitt. Tony injured his leg last
week in the scrimmage Wltl‘1_f_l'1€
varsity. ’

* * *

The frosh completed only one‘
pass in Saturday's game, and that
was with a little help. George Gla-
gola took Bill Reynold’s ‘pass, but
only after it was. tipped into his
hands.

* lit *

Frank DiLeo and Warren Walton
had the honor of being co-captains
for the first frosh game.

The majority of the onlookers at
the frosh game were parents or
friends of the competing freshmen.
The Stadium looked awfully barren
with only 250 spectators.

Wrestling Gives Big Chance
To “Non-Rep” Students, 1

Fof the first time since 1938 the
University of Pittsburgh has a wrest-
ling team. '

And the sport’s revival means that
men students will have a chance
to try for avarsity letter, truly start.-
ing from scratch and on an equal
basis with each other. There are
no holdovers, no returning letter-
men.

It is the opportunity that comes
only with the introduction of a new
sport.

A ten-match schedule was an-
nounced today by Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Hamilton. A

The Panther grapplers are coach-
ed by Rex Peery, who directed
Tulsa Central to four state titles,
and developed four national ‘title
holders. Their season will open on
Dec. 10, at home against Gettys-
burg. °

A former star and champion at
Oklahoma A&M, where wrestling is
on a par with basketball as a spec-
tator’s sport, Peery developed four
state title winners and on three
other occasions his team finished
in the runnerup spot. A

The workout locale has shifted‘
from Tree’s Gym to Pitt Stadium,

where entirely new apparatus has
been installed. As of now several
dozen aspirants are training every
day for the coming season.

The schedule:

Panther Stock Takes Dip  

As Indiana Runs Amuck

, B)’ DAVE POLLOCK
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- After being completely outclassed b if
Indiana’svictory-hungry Hoosiers, the Panthers revert to their or
role of underdogs for Saturday's clash at Philadelphia with un-
beaten Pefm. ' 1

Whether the Jungle Cats can up-
set the Quakers as they have so
many favorites in the last two sea-
sons, depends on their ability to
stop the running and passing of
Penn’s Bob Deuber and Red Bag-
nell.

Deuber and Bagnell, along with
Co-captain and fullback Ray Dooney,
spearhead a Quaker attack that

can go all the way"from any point
on the field.

Penn Improves

George Munger’s club has im-
proved every weekend in winning
four straight games. Dartmouth,
Princeton, Columbia, and Navy, in
that order, have fallen before the
Red and Blue.

Penn lost 22 lettermen through
graduation last season including
itsAll-American center Chuck Bed-
narik. _ A

The line that the "great Bednarik
led during the past campaigns
isn’t as strong this year. But it
still has beef and has held its op-
ponents to an average ofone touch-
down per game, something that Pitt
could boast of, too, up until the
past two weeks.

Indiana Embarrasses Pitt

Indiana took up Saturday where
Miami left off the week before by
running anil passing the Pitts silly.

The chief villain who led the
Hoosier attack before a howling
Dad’s Day crowd was quarterback
Nick Sebek. He passed for twoTD’s,
set-up two others on his pitching,
and scored another on a quarter-
back sneak.

 Victory That  

 

Oddly enough, the Pitt-Indiana case is one of the conqueror being worse
off than the victim. To Hoosier fans, Saturday’s victory can only mean
temporary solace, for their school is in the throes of a real football depres-
sion - a depression even worse than the one from which Pitt has emerged.
‘For the Panthers, there was a cure for the ailment. The medicine --

western Pennsylvania’s high school
italent—was there. Pitt needed only
to come around to taking it. In the
-case ofthe Hoosiers, however, there
is a fear that the sickness is in-
curable.

There is simply no source of foot-
ball material.

  

 
 

Few Gridders

In all Indiana cnly 124 high
, schools exist. To make matters
worse, the schoolboys, who are
mostly (if the farms, go in for bas-
ketball rather than football. The in-
dustrial centers turn out some fair-
ly good high school grid teams, but
v-outside cf Indianapolis and Evans-
ville, there isn’t much except farm-
land down around Bloomington’s
Indiana U in the southwest part of
E the state.
Not only do the Hoosiers have
to contend with skimpy football
CFO-PS: but they have to compete
for the meager pickings with Notre
Dame and Purdue.‘ \

With such conditions prevailing
_in the home territory, Indiana has
had to turn to distant points for
reinforcements. And few places have
J yielded so freely as western Penn-

‘sylvania.

 
   

   

  

  
 

 
 

Coach From Pa.

, For the past few years, Penn-
';sylvania boys have appeared on
Indiana rosters by the dozens. One
cf the reasons is the Hoosier coach-
‘ing staff. ‘Clyde Smith, the head
man, is an ex-Genevan and some-
«thing of ’an influence up and down
the Mvnongohela Valley.

" Moreover, Smith’s line coach
Steve Sinko, spent substantial time

So Smith and Sinko make a pretty
fair one-two punch for Indiana in
the coal and steel regions.

icepted the rumor because some of

«at‘Duquesne aiding Buff Donelli.

 

This fall when a particularly
large delegation of local boys en-

around that the Big Ten school
had let down the academic bars.

Rumor Nixed
These players were the ones, so
went the story, whom the other col-
leges rejected because all they had
learned in high school were their
signals. Happily, few persons ac-

the players were particularly known
for their outstanding scholastic
records.

The fact is that Smith and Sinko
have influence hereabouts. On top
of this, they have a strong selling
point in their school’s lush cam-
pus—said to be the world’s most
beautiful.

All this notwithstanding, there
is no cause to start yelling about
local talent getting away. The con-
sistency with which the red-shirted
team keeps losing proves that Penn-
sylvania only goes so far as to
help Indiana get 11 men on the
field. .

The winning players are plainly
not in Bloomington.

An underdog Theta Chi team upset the undefeated, untied Delta Tau
Delta six at Schenley Oval Friday, 13-6. The fast-moving game saw the
ivictors sparked by the passing and running of Joe Cruciano.

The Chi's drew first blood in the second quarter when Cruciano passed

the end zone, and then, intercept-
ing a pass, raced half the field for
another score. I

Scoring in the last quarter on a
pass from Silvers to Mandelblatt
marked the first time this year that
the SAM’s were able to score. The
final tally for the Phi Gam’s was a
five yard heave from Rex McClain
to Andy Wissinger.

Harriers Win

In WR Meet

Pitt’s cross country outlook con-
tinued on the upgrade Saturday when
the Panthers chalked up their sec-
ond victory of the season with an
easy 15-50 win over Western Re-
serve in a dual meet at Schenley
Park.

Whatever chance the Panthers
hold in the IC4A. meet in New York
on Nov. 14 will be determined next
Saturday when the locals make their
first_trip of the season. They will
meet tough competition in a quad-
rangular meet with Army, Columbia,
and‘ Pennsylvania at Van Court-
landt Park, N. Y.

Sophomore Frank Kuzma and vet-
eran Jay Neilson paced Pitt to vic-
tory Saturday with both men circling
the course within 25 minutes. Kuzma
finished first with a time of 24.53
while Neilson followed close be-
hind, three seconds later. '
The remainder of the Pitt team
finished in a tie for third. Ed Ber-
man, "Red” Weigel, Ted Zatkovich,
Ken Mahanna, and Jack.McMahon
crossed the line 25.29. lien O’Con-
nell was the first visitor to end, a
full minute behind the last Panther.

two of its own to give Indiana a
scare before finally falling apart.

Carl DePasqua plunged- for the
first score to culminate a 78-yard
drive. Then at the start of the sec-
ond half the Panthers went 82
yards in eight plays with Jimmy Joe

Nick Bolkavac converted both

six points. But the Hoosiers’ scored

Freshman Center Hits A

Backs, Books Hard

B5’ STANLEY SKIRBOLL
He’s 18 years old, 5 feet 11 inches tall, and weighs 203 pounds.
He was an all-Monongehela Valley center in his senior year, and capped
his three years of varsity ball for Donora by being named on the Dapper

Dan all-star team.

And he’s here at Pitt on a schol-
astic ‘scholarship.

He's Gabriel Gembarosky, twenty-
‘third member of his graduating class
and the newest addition to the bus
ad department.

Gabe Different

“Gabe” is one of those fellows
that stands out in practice. You'll
usually find him with the dirtiest.
face and a uniform to match. He’s
full of hustle and is constantly
chattering.

Although Gabe played all his
football under Jimmy Russell of
Donora, a strict T man, he finds that
the singlewing is not too difficult.
“I like the single wing much more
than I thought I would, and it’s
‘ easier than I had
expected,” is
Gaoe’s opinionofl
the Pitt system.
With the varsity
to use the end-
over-end pass
from center next
year, all the frosh
centers are con-
centrating on that
type of pass. “It
doesn’t make any

 

Gembarosky
difference to me,” he said, "which
we use since I got to learn them
both from the beginning anyhow.”

Unique Thrill J
Just as Gabe was asked if there
was anything he could classify as

a thrill during his high scnool days,‘

Dick Cassiano, assistant dean of
men ambled over.

“Oh,’ said the Gabe, “I inter-
cepted a pass in the Dapper Dan
game, and there was a couple of
blocked kicks while I was at Do-
nora -- and say, Dick, I made a 95
on my first math test.”

 

PITT’S PANTHERS have their
first victory to gain over a Minne-
sota football team. The Gophers
have walked off with five straight

For Army Tilt.

Pitt's jayvee gtidders, realizing
that Army will prove tougher on
Friday than did Geneva last week,
are buckling down to strenuous
practice this week. '

The game will be played at West
Point in famous Michie Stadium.On
Saturday the jayvees will entrain
for Philadelphia to witness their
big brothers in action against Penn.

From all indications of the spirit
displayed at practice the boys are
eager to win so that they can be in
a joyful mood at the Pitt-Penn
game.

Sophomore wingback Bill Carroll
has caught the attention of the
coaching staff and will probably
see plenty of action on Friday.

fessor of chemistry here, has re-
ceived the John Scott Award for
his outstanding work on the iso-
‘lation, chemical identification,
and synthesis of vitamin C.

In past years the John Scott
Award .has been given to such
noted scientists as Thomas Edison,
Guglielmo Marconi, Irving Lang-
muir, and Sir Alexander‘ Fleming.
The award was presented yesterday

‘at a meeting of the Pittsburgh sec-

Besides the vitamin C research,
Dr. King has done fundamental re-
search in nutrition, enzyme studies
and work on the molecular struc-
ture of sugars and fats.

Born in Entiat, Washington, in
1896, he did his undergraduate

On History

“It's hard to realize that the stu-
dents now do not remember when
there was no Cathedral of Learning,”
Mrs. Agnes Lynch Starrett, univ-
versity editor, told a group of trans-
fers and transfer committee members
at a forum recently. \‘

Mrs. Starrett is well qualified to.
talk on Pitt's history. She has been
associated with Pitt since she was
a student in the school when it was

located “on the hills”

She is also the author of “Through
One Hundred and Fifty Years," a
history of the university.

Mrs. Starrett told the coeds, "The
University has grown along with the
city in thegdirections in which the
city has grown, and to the core
curriculum was added what was
needed and wanted.

"You students are a part of a
growing, building institution, world
respected for its ideals of progress
and brotherhood. It is truly a thrill-
ing experience, to know about the
rich heritage Pitt has to offer its
students.”

How old is old lace? That’s the
question the Pitt Players are asking
the student body.

A free subscription booklet with
tickets to the Players’ four produc-

tions will be given to the person

coming nearest to guessing the age
of the piece of lace being exhibited
this week at the Student Desk.
Guessers will attempt to give the
the‘ age in years and months of the
lace. The guess, together with the

student’s name and phone number,‘

must be left at the Student Desk in
the Players’ box.

“Arsenic and Old Lace,” the
Players’ first production, will be
presented Nov. 3, 4, and 5 in Ste-
phen Foster Memorial Hall. The
Kesserling comedy is the tale of
two zany sisters who have a unique
way of handling men. They bury
them in the cellar. Their brother
Teddy, who thinks he is the Roose-
velt of the same name, adds to the
confusion.

Reserve seats for the show are
on sale at the Student Desk for $1.
