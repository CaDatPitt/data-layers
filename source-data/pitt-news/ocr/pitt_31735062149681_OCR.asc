On Housing

Fraternity Planning
Group Outlines Ideas

. By CHARLES CAMARATA

One more step was taken toward
realizing an ideal “fraternity row”
last Tuesday evening at an Inter-
fraternity council meeting when
Chancellor John G. Bowman
pledged to fraternity men his help
and direction for plans of future
housing.

In a three hour conference follow-
ing a dinner at the Phi Gamma
Delta house, at which the chancellor
and Dr. Vincent Lanfear, dean of
men, were chief guests, members of
I-F council discussed the possibil-
ity of future fraternity housing. As-
suring the members full support by
the University administration, the
chancellor expressed his approval
of the sincere interest of fraternity
men in their plans for better houses.

According to I—F council’s hous-
ing committee, the future houses
will be constructed for the sole
function of fraternity houses, con-
taining ample sleeping quarters, suf-
ficient sanitary facilities, trophy and
game rooms, and a chapter room.
Alliihouses will be heated by one
central heating system and will be
ﬁreproof.

The question of land for the
houses was discussed with the pos-
sibility of it being donated by the
University to the various" chapters.
The‘ ‘land would be tax-exempt and
consequently the present maintain-
encé' éosts of fraternity houses would

these houses is aimed at reducing
up-keep cost‘ to a minimum so-as
to permit more students to “go fra-
terniity” and cut down the number
of “street”-'-‘car” students‘. A

After inve‘st‘igatingl the housing
problem, the committee concludes
that 'a- majority of the‘ present fra-
ternity houses‘ are if_ladequate'h for
supplying he‘ needs of members.

Nine” fraternities already have
plans for their individual houses,
and some have been promised finan-
cial supp‘or”t for the‘ proposed houses
up to 40" per cent of the cost of
construction. _

If the line on the graph declines from a high spot to a very low spot

the subject is an “ergo-philiac” or one who loves work.

If the line is

erratic and confused the subject is an “ergo-phobiac” or just plain lazy.
Members of the Pitt News staff who were used as subjects in a mass

Bacall, Pyle to Run Style Show
In Hotel Schenley Ball Room

We were just sitting around and
spitting when this fella come in.
You could tell right away he was
the solid type, ready to trade a
punch for a punch or his life for
an ad.

Anyway he says, quick-like, “I’m

not gonna chew the cabbage. I got
a set-up.”

“Go ahead, set up,” we says.

Obliging-like, he sets up. We
had a beer apiece.

“Like I was saying,” he says,

foaming at the mouth, “My name’s
Cort Bacall, business manager of
the News. We got a thing lined up
for the Hotel Schenley. Monday,
March 3. I picked up a moll, name
of Gene Pyle, see, and we’re gonna
run this brawl. Something new,
see? Only we can’t ﬁgure out what
to call it.”

‘‘Call it the style show,” we tell
him.

“That’s a good name, considering
you didn’t even know what it was
about. Anyway, what it’s gonna

be, we ﬁxed things up with the
mob from Rosenbaum’s. First we
get a few guys and gals and wrap
clothes around ’em. Then they
cakewalk up and down a while.
Then we get out the squeeze boxes
and mark up the planks. Follow
me?”

“We’re way ahead of you.”

“Age before beauty,” he says.

“Pearls before swine,” we says.

“Anyway,” he says, “The way we
ﬁgure to run it, we’ll have a ballot
on the fourth page of your rag.
Then you pick out who you want
to be models, write the names on
the coupon, and drop them into the
ballot box, ground floor elevator
lobby.”

Before he leaves, we milk out a
few million more facts from this
ivory tower of information pleases.
The show and the dance run with-
out any tariff barriers. Someone
will comment on the styles. God
bless Rosenbaum’s.

University women will have a
chance to turn the tables on the
men tonight and bring imported
loves to the Heart Hop tonight at
Hotel Schenley.

Kitty Koontz, C41, president of
the senior class. will lead the heart
promenade with Norv Johnston,

houettes of romantic couples
throughout the ages will help pro-
vide the proper St. Valentine’s day

G Quick Reports

Enrollment Rise

Second semester enrollment ﬁg-
ures have topped last year’s in both
the graduate and undergraduate
schools of the University, according
to the latest reports from the reg-
istrar’s office.

Incomplete tabulations show a
total of 6,897 for the undergradu-
ate schools plus the graduate
schools, School of Applied Social
Sciences, Afternoon, Evening, and
Saturday division and the retail
training division. Last year 6,854
registered.

There were 83 new freshmen. this
semester and only 77 last year.
New upperclass transfers totaled
47 while last year’s number was 34.

In the graduate schools, 135 new
students were registered whereas
168 were registered last year. The
ﬁgures for the Afternoon, Evening,
and Saturday classes were 456 as
compared with 457, and in the
School of Applied Social Sciences,
there were 33 new students com-
pared with 28 of last year.

“In times when things are as un-
certain as they are now, we could
anticipate an extreme enrollment
ﬁgure, considerably over or under
past enrollments,” explained J. G.
Quick, University registrar. “Most
interesting,” he continued, “is that
it has remained constant.”

Darkness & ‘Smog’ Fall over 0ur Fair City; 2
Undergraduates Measure Iligh- Water Nlarks

. By EDITH ROSENBLATT

Reviewing the week, we find that
the most popular greeting was,
“Hello, how are you, and I’ll et
my high—water mark is worse than
yours.”

If you knock the coal out of your
eyes, you will notice that practical-
ly everyone around you has a red
face. Don’t run away; just you
sandpaper your face with the wash-
room towels four times a day and
see what happens!

And then there’s the fellow in
Economics 536 ZR who raised his
hand to answer a question. The
professor immediately hauled him
to the front of the class, and hand
still raised, substituted him for
Table XV because he had a perfect
graph of the business cycle on his
wrist.

Let’s give credit to the six fra-

ternity men who recognized a
worthy project hanging around
waiting to be sponsored. They

spent Monday night on the quad-
rangle bagging smog which they
made into nylon stockings and will

raffle off tonight to pay their ex-
cess soap bill.

Of all the nationality rooms, the
Swedish room is perhaps the bright-
est. Its walls are coated with white-
wash. And yet, last Tuesday a mar-
shall had to explain to a lady visi-
tor that it did not represent the
Dark Ages in France.

Comment of the week: “The boys

who run the express elevator are
the luckiest people at Pitt”—-cough,
excuse me—“They get to breathe
at every thirty-sixth floor stop.”

Fashion note: People in zoology
labs will not wear white; there is
much danger of being dissected for
a raccoon.

And I wish you and your sinuses
a pleasant week-end.

At Least It’s Encouraging to Kiiow
That The-re’s Some Scientific Reason

“Smoke does not collect when
there is a wind,” says Donald C.
Bradford, University seismologist.
“The smog occurs when Pittsburgh
is in the center of a mild storm
area or a cyclonic depression, or
when it is in the center of a high
pressure area or an anti-cyclone,
and there is no wind to remove the
accumulated smoke.”

“This condition,” says Bradford,
“is similar to the eye of a hurricane

when air is whirling about a low
pressure center at a high velocity.
but in the middle of the low pres-
sure center the wind velocity is al-
most zero.”

As a solution for the smog prob-
lem Bradford suggests the improve-
ment of heating systems, and the
burning of hard fuel. “The smoke is
caused by incomplete combustion,.
and the condition could be im-
proved if the fuel used could be-
completely burned.”

‘Free’ Love, or
The High Cost of Giving

INSIDIOUS ARE THE WAYS of the modern
merchant, and shrewd is he in the matter of
procuring an aggrandizement of his proﬁts.

Valentine’s day is here, and with it comes the
annual exchange of mass-produced poems of
sentiment. Hundreds of words have been
found, begged, or borrowed to rime with the
“me” of valentine.

And yet we ﬁnd a sorry note. The newspa-
pers are advertising. The sign of the heart

marches up and down and across the pages of
the country.

They bid us buy gifts for our beloved.

V The merchant loads his counters with pho-
tograph frames, boxes of candy, perfumes, books,
and motley other designations of civilized love.

— It is our intention to obey the trend. Last
November we were recalcitrant, unreconstructed
rebels. We completely missed our turkey.

We may conform, but we cannot forget. We
cannot forget that Valentine’s day was once
nothing more than a time for the interchange
of frilly cards and rag paper squares with cari-
catures of spinsters, hoboes, and painted ladies.

‘ There is, for our wou.nded hearts, but one
balm to soothe the scar of commercialism. Come
next Fourth of July and we shall ﬁnd the ad-
dresses of these perﬁdious perpetrators of this
outrage upon‘ romance. To each we shall send,
wrapped in cellophane and tinsel, aravishing,
soul-enticing, well-timed set of dynamite
charges, with acetylene torches to match.

Pink Banners
And a Say Uiisaial

THE PINK HOPES of American youth held
their annual all-out bull-session in Washington
this week and added to that city’s verbal smog
with denunciations of Aid to Britain, FDR and
Friend Wendell,'and the other manifestations
of things capitalistic.

Sad to relate, the American Youth congress,
1941 rendition, was a flop, artistically and V0-
cally. The boys couldn’t get in on the commit-
tee hearings of the aid bill, so the boys left town
with their little red speeches unread. That’s a
pity.

They may never get a chance to recite these
same lines. The Balkans, you know, and maybe
the Kremlin will order a right-about face".

__’l_‘hat the boys are wired to the party line is
apparent to us. Two years ago, wired for sound
from the same Muscovite sources, the boys were
ina dither about the Nazi-Fascist peril. Now,
forthetime being at least, it’s the draft and
the help England movement that they’re Squawk-
ing about. 

' Perhaps they should have been given a dig-
niﬁed rostrum. Perhaps this should be done
before someone has the chance to change their
-script and begin them singing, “There’ll Always
Be an England,” with the booming, reactionary
chorus murmuring, “Socialistic, of course.” Who
knows? We may ﬁnd them wearing red, red,
and red Aid to Britain buttons.

We’ll Sign Off
It You’ll Sign Up

PROPAGANDA is nasty.

And so is catching the ﬂu, developing pneu-
monia, smashing your head in an auto crash.

We’ve had to propagandize about something
all year.

And all year Pitt students have had to shut-
tie to the hospitals, infected with inﬂuenza, laid
‘up with lobar, groaning with fractured bones
and contusions.

We’Ve both been working, then, with nasty
“words.

We now suggest that the News and the Pitt
student body get together.

We’ll stop ballyhooing the student hospital-
ization plan, stop banging out galleys of pressure
stories about why students should walk up to
State hall and pay $2.50 to insure themselves
against the ﬁnancial shock of unforseen hospital
bills.

We’ll do this, we promise you, if you can
show us how you can immunize yourself against
automobile accidents.

Nice work if you can, get it?

Prologue
I have accepted, formulated, and expounded a num-

ber of theories in my brief career. Most of them I
I have taken sides with causes. Most of them
I regret. I have posed as many things. Most of
them I regret. I have borrowed answers from exam-
inations, cigarettes from my friends when I had them
myself. I have cut classes and misappropriated com-
mas. I have laughed too much, cried too much, and
debunked too much. I regret it all.

Still, I regret not a thing. I’m one of those who
has to learn the hard way. But I learn.

This is an interesting world we live in. There
truly is never a dull moment. Bartenders, dentists,
shopkeepers. Farmers, plumbers, artists. Longshore-
men, educators, baibers. Panderers, prize-ﬁghters,
engineers. Cattlemen, inventors, ﬁremen. They all
have something to say. They all “knoi. ’ what Amer-
ica should do in this interesting world. They are not
mountebanks, like politicians and economists. They are
not blind. They think. Some of them want a genuine
democracy. Some of them want a semi-democracy.
Some of them want extremes, just as some prefer win-
ter or summer to spring or fall.

33 1-3 7/0 Blood Boils

But all Americans are agreed at least on this: We
must, as a people, take aim and shape our course now
——at once. We’re late, and we must make up our lost
time. I’m an American, with forbearers of English,
Irish, and Russian blood, and I think I have something
to say, too.

I’m not an anglophile, nor a kisser-of—the-blarney,
nor a Stalinist. I hold that we do not think as na-
tionalities, but that our hobbies, environments, and pro-
fessions combine to direct our thinking apparatus. An
Italian cobbler with a wife and four or ﬁve bambinos
and a Chinese sandal-maker with a like family—ex-
eluding language diﬁ-lculties——would have more in
common with each other than, say, an Italian cobbler
and an Italian bank teller. The American newspaper-
woman and the American textile worker are _total
strangers. ' . 3

All countries, though, are ruggedly individualgf That
is, they are politically independent. They are .nottcon-
cerned with universal unity. gThere is in truth no
Porne-Berlin-Tokyo axis. The Japs don’t give _:two
raps for the Mussos, and the Heinies would have them
all in hell. The United States is, for the most part,
aware of this, and aware also that Great Britain is no
ally of hers. The English have never held and do not
now hold any love for us. By us, I mean the 7,000,000
Germans, 3,000,000 Slavs, 1,000,000 Mexicans, the mil-
lions of other nationalities and William Saroyan.

America Needs

War Aims

Editor, the Pitt News:

Winston Churchill has made the
statement that he wants America’s
tools, not its men. But when the
German attack this spring really
“gets hot” he may move to strike
this remark from the record and ask
for our manpower. I believe that
Amcrica’s supreme decision will
come within the next few months.

I submit that before the United
States makes any decision in favor
of sending men abroad we must
have come to a deﬁnite conclusion as
to our war aims. England is being
attacked, she must fight. We, on
the other hand, are without an op-
ponent battering at our lifeline. We
have the time to formulate a pol-
icy. Why then must America make
her war aims and what would the
be? S

0 The Beleagured League

First of all we know or should
know that the defeat of Hitler does
not insure future peace just as the

fall of the Kaiser did not portend

international harmony. "Ne know,
too, that morality must be extend-
ed from within the nations to in-'
clude the entire world. And the

only way to achieve this is to form
the nations of the world into a
union or a league. If the countries
of the earth are responsible to no
organization and if there is no su-
per power to hold the individual
powers in check, wars must inevit-
ably occur.

History has shown us that with-
out the U. S. to put pressure on the
European nations they will resort
to squabbling among__ themselves.
History has also shown us that the
economic exhaustion of Germany
was the reason for Hit1er’s rise. A

From these lessons which were
iaiiglit in the classroom of the
world during the 1918-41 period
we must formulate our war aims.

0 Aggressive Co-Opemtioll

Before we decide to ﬁght we must
have agreed to engage in a League
of All Nations and play an aggres-
sive role in it. We must have
agreed to help a defeated Germany
all we can with our tremendous re-
sources. We must have agreed to
continue Secretary Hull’s recipro-
cal trade treaties to their logical
conclusion by wiping out war in-
spiring tariifs and duties which par-
ticularly blight multi-countried Eu-
rope.

Finally we must realize that we
are living in a family of nations.

. Well,
lvlargaret Ann Gunther _and Hans

head of the department of chemis-
try, called upon University gradu-
ates to “make possible even greater

advantages for the student of today
and tomorrow.”

The article, appearing in the Feb-
ruary issue of Alumni Review,
monthly publication of the General
Alumni association, appealed to
former University students to “try
to do our part for the Univer-
sity which has given us so much.”

Means by which aid could be
given, Dr. Silverman suggested,
were wide and varied. He declared
that the creation of prizes and
awards to outstanding students
would do much to encourage such
students.

Through an enlarged system of
fellowships and scholarships the
University could not only attract
more of the world’s outstanding
artists, scientists, and professors but
would help create scholars and
research workers in many valuable
ﬁelds of human endeavor, Dr. Sil-
verman declared.

Such an enlargement of the num-
ber of available scholarships and
fellowships, according to Dr. Sil-
verman, “would set the University
forward.”

Besides the two ﬁnancial aids
named above, other methods sug-
gested by Dr. Silverman as meas-
ures which would be of “immeas-
urable value” to the University
were: the creation of professors,
the enlargement of a fund to bring
outstanding lecturers in the ﬁelds
of art and science to the Univer-
sity, and the uniﬁcation of alumni
inﬂuence behind a “Praise Pitt”
campaign.

we cannot embark on a course of

Protests Slugging
of Ed Straloslci

Editor, Pitt News

It is natural that in any athletic
contest there be some physical con-
tact. However, in the recent epi-
sode at the basketball game be-
tween Pitt and West Virginia I was
unable to ﬁnd any justification for
the intentional slugging of Eddie
Straloski.

During the game, neither team
played lily-pure ball; yet until the
ﬁght there had been signs of the
intense feeling which evidently was
felt by some members of the West
Virginia team. Is it possible that
two college teams can’t play a bas-
ketball game without the added at-
traction of a free-for-all? The
game may well have been in a “gas
light” district rather than in the
conﬁnes of an educational institu-
tion. If basketball can’t be played
for the sport of it, why play it?

Panthers Druh
Mountaineers

In Fast Battle

Brilliant Floor Play
Stops West Virginia

In one of the most amazing exhi-
bitions of marksmanship ever pre-
sented in the Stadium pavilion, Doc
‘Carlson’s Pitt Panthers rolled up a
56-45 victory over the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers last Tuesday
night.

', Paced by the ﬂashy play of

George Kocheran, who showed more

basketball brilliance in his short
stay on the court than he had ex-
hibited all year, the Panthers grab-
bed an early lead which they held
all the way.

Sensational Shooting

Kocheran and Eddie Straloski
each contributed two nifty long
shots to start the Panthers off right.
ll/leanwhile, West Virginia, with
number one man Rudy Baric com-
pletely tied up by Mel Port, didn’t
score a ﬁeld goal until almost eight
.minutes of the game had gone by.

Once the Mountaineers started to
go, however, they rolled up the
score in a hurry. _ Only the sensa-
tional shooting of the Panthers, 14
good out of the ﬁrst 24 tries at the
hoop, kept the Pittites ahead in a
torrid ﬁrst half which wound up
“with Pitt leading, 33-29.

For West Virginia, forward Jim-
rmy Ruch’s consistent sharp-shoot-
ing and the uncanny accuracy at the
foul line of the. entire Mountaineer
ﬁrst ﬁve kept Dyke Raase’s boys in

‘the game.

Hamilton Cracks

Midway through the second half
West Virginia pulled up to within
one point of the Panthers at 39-38.
But Tay Malarkey and Mel Port
added some fancy shooting maneu-
vers to their fancy ﬂoor play at that
point and shot the Panthers way
ahead again.

Klein and Milanovich got the
scoring bug, too, along with a cou-
ple more personal fouls, to offset
the resurge of West Virginia power
under the cleft guidance of chubby
play-maker Scotty Hamilton.

But with three minutes to go and
the Panthers pulling steadily ahead,

the tension of the battle became
. too much for Hamilton and he cut

loose with the now-famous hay-

‘maker to Ed Straloski’s jaw. The

rest of the game was anti—climax.

From 3. dark horse in pre-
season selections to the current
undefeated leader of the I—F
basketball race is the story of
Sigma Alpha Mu’s rags to
riches climb.

‘Throughout the first half compe-
tition, the ﬁve iron men from SAM
have shown considerable ﬁght and
determination in an effort to win
their first basketball trophy.

In their most recent test, the
Sammies put a blot on the previous-
ly unblemished record of Phi Kappa.
Hack White, Morris Mayer, Harry
Abramovitz, Danny Colton, and
Mel Frank make up the starting
combination of Sigma Alpha Mu.

Tied for second place with Phi
Kappa in the ﬁrst half standing is
Phi Gamma Delta, showing an en-
viable record of ﬁve victories and
one defeat.

Phi Kaps Slip

Phi Kappa was odds-on pre-sea-
son favorites to retain their crown,
for the addition of several outstand-
ing players boosted their ratings.
They started at a terriﬁc pace, then
slowed. up until their meeting with
the Sammies.

The Fijis have several veteran
performers back from last year’s
team to aid in their quest for the
crown. Bobby Thurbon, Earl Pres-
sel, and Al Holbrook compose the
backbone of the team.

Probably the top game of the
second half will be the meeting be-
tween these two I-F giants. Both
pla.y strictly offensive ball with
long shots frequently contributing
to their victories.

Showing a wide open race for the
ﬁrst time since the organization of
the league, the independents should
be a deﬁnite threat against frater-
nity basketball domination.

Two Unbeaten

At the top of the heap are two
undefeated clubs, Big Five and In-
dependents. The Big Five team is
composed of upperclassmen from
the Pittsburgh district, while fresh-
man and sophomores are predomi-
nant in the lineup of the Independ-
dents. _

Fighting for the second place post
are the Valley Boys and PBI. The
Valley Boys, last year’s champion-
ship team, are sparked by Ernie
Bonelli, Jack Stetler, and Walt
West.

Grady Sends
Pitt Swimmers
Against Lions

Ben Grady takes his swimming
squad to State College, Pa., tomor-
row afternoon, where the boys will
attempt to chalk_ up their ﬁrst win

of the season at the expenseof the
Penn State Lions. ’’ ’

It won’t be an easy job either,
since the Lions already have two “
’,victories and no defeats to their

credit and boast of several veter-
ans who have gained national rec-
ognition because of their aquatic
accomplishments. ‘ '

hasn’t been defeated yet this year.‘

V Another Lion, Bob Clauss, is good
enough to be the number one sprint

swimmer on almost any other splash —

team, but he can’t quite .match
Kirkpatrick’s performances. How-
ever, the number of second place
points he accounts for usually means
plenty when the totals are taken.

Other outstanding Lion mermen
are Price, Ostermayer, Bertram,
Del Manzo, and Webb. Although
Penn State "owns victories over
W&J and Carnegie Tech, Pitt is
rated as much superior to either of
the two losers.

Grady will be relying on his
usual crew of veterans and ﬁrst
year men. Among others, Dick
Ames, Joe Kaule, Joe Orloff, Gus
Wilde, A1 Samson, Marty Kramer,
Herb Cosgrove, and Oscar Kurren
are scheduled to make the trip.

Dr. Farmer Speaks

“The Altar in the World’s Re-

day.

Elinor Barbrow, Jean Brink,

Service Delayed

For Guardsmen

Orders from Washington post-
poned the calling into service of the
One Hundred Seventy-Sixth Field
Artillery regiment of the National
Guard, which, for the past two
weeks, has been holding classes and
living at the University.

Marking the second time in Uni-
versity history that United States
army troops have been quartered
and trained on campus the reg-
iment has been attending classes in
the Cathedral, and living in the
completed part of Alumni hall, now
being converted into chemistry lab-
oratories.

The sight of the men, marching
to class in strict military fashion,
rather than using the leisurely am-
ble of most c1ass—goers at Pitt has
aroused considerable interest and
comment.

“It’s all part of their training in
military discipline,” said one of the
ofiicers in explaining the reason for
the marching.

Six Pitt Trackers to Compete
With N ation’s Best Tomorrow

Six Pitt trackers prance before
Madison Square Garden’s bright
lights in New York City tomorrow
evening in the annual New York
AC games, where the outstanding
spike wearers of the nation match
strides in one of the indoor season’s
most brilliant shows.

Bullet Bill Carter and Harold
(Hap) Stickel headline the Pitt en-
try as contestants in a star-studded
field of sprint men. Harold Davis,
the lettuce-eating California sprint
star has returned to the coast but
Barney Ewell, the Penn State ﬂyer
and Herb Thompson, a perennial
contender figure to toe the mark in
the ﬁnal heat with Pitt duet. This
contingent promises a hair-raising
contest, with the outcome 21 tossup.

Making his ﬁrst competitive leap
of the campaign, junior Dusty
Rhoades jumps against Earl
Meadows, holder  ~ .
of the world’s
indoor and co-
holder of the
outdoor w o r l d
re c o r cl, Dick
Ganslen, former
NCAA champ
from Columbia,
and Ken Dills,
another Southern
California ace.

Both Rhoades
and Red Jessup
have soared con-
sistently above »
the 13-foot mark Carter
in the Pitt indoor track house. The
Pitt indoor record stands at 12 feet
9 inches; consequently these junior
stars ﬁgure to smash the old stand-
ard to smithereens in the approach-
ing weeks.

Although the mile relay team as
yet to score a victory in the eastern
races, the boys are slowly rounding
into form, and this week the Pitt
baton passers may forge into the
front rank. Stickel, running leadoff,
and Del Anderson, the long striding
junior half miler, running anchor,
have shown the best form to date.

In the other relay posts, the most
consistent performer is Pegis Lark-
in, who joins the list of good track-
men that never wore a track shoe
before running under the tutelage
of Pitt coach Carl Olson. Larkin
has moved ahead of captain Larry
Tregoning, who is battling Bud Graf
for the fourth place on the mile
quartette.

Introduces

"Scientiﬁc

Humanism’ Theories

. By EDGAR BEIGEL

Combining a new hope that emotions can be rationalized and har-
nessed for the social welfare with the much-heralded proposals for in-
dustrial technocracy, Dr. Oliver L. Reiser, associate professor of philo-
sophy, has created a new thought pattern whereby “western civilization

can be saved”
world war.

Scientiﬁc Humanism—a modern-
ization of the humanism of the
renaissance-—calls for a fusion of
all political, theological, economic,
and philosophical thought of today
into one system to combat the va-
rious “isms” that today drive the
world into war and tyranny.
Speaks to Seminar

Speaking to the Social Science
seminar last Monday on “The
Meaning of Scientiﬁc Humanism,”
Dr. Reiser explained and further
clariﬁed this new idea—and ideal
-——that has developed in this country
and in Europe during the past ten
years.

Based on the contention that sci-
ence on the one hand has led to a
mechanistic materialism, while au-
thoritarianism on the other has de-
veloped into a supernaturalism, Dr.
Reiser proposes that a blending of
science, philosophy, and religion
into a “humanized and socialized”
pattern will provide the three needs
of the modern world: conﬁdence in
the future, motive for work, and
goals of achievement.

Developing from the philosophies
of William James, Thomas Paine,
and John Dewey, Scientific Human-
ism will combine logic and ethics.
The .“Godlike unruffledness” of lib-
erals during the post-war era will
no longer differentiate facts and
values, but in the future will com-
bine the two, will associate rather
than seperate emotions and hard-
boiled intellectualism. All activi-
ties—social, political, religious-—
will follow this pattern. The pro-
grams for social reform and the dis-
coveries of science will go hand—in-
hand.

No Dogmatic Program

However, Scientiﬁc Humanism is
not tied down to any speciﬁc pro-
gram as were the Marxisms or the
religious determini ts." Rather Dr.
Reiser proposes organizations of
scientists and intellectuals to scien-
tiﬁcally survey wants, needs, and
resources, and to formulate speciﬁc
programs on a rational basis.

Under this thought system, all
industry would be socialized for a
common good rather than individual
motives; control of industry would
be exercised by engineers and tech-
nicians. Blueprints for such a new

after the present

\ society would involve the abandon-

ment of laissez-faire and individual
enterprise for the sake of a social-
ized planned economy.

Not Technoctracy

However, Scientific Humanism
surpasses technocracy in its empha-
sis on cultural outlets as well as
material organization. And it dif-
fers from communism in that it re-
lies upon reason and persuasion
rather than violence. _

Politically it would support a
world federation with an interna-
tional police force; and intellect-
ually it would place all thinking
and planning on a world-wide or
global basis.

Resistance to this new system
comes mainly from the scientists
and technicians who are too naive
amidst their provincial economic
and religious ideas to accept the
sense of service that must accom-
pany scientiﬁc discovery, Dr. Reiser
claimed.

Although science has created a
“togetherness” among men. quicker
than centuries of religion, Dr. Reiser
believes that this same science, un-
less it is harnessed—unless the ma-
chine is socialized-—will ultimate-
ly destroy the western civilization
that it created.

Nurses Celebrate

St. Valentine’s Day

As a celebration for St. Valen-
tine’s day, students in the School of
Nursing will hold a tea today from
3:30 to 5 o’clock in the Eleanor Gil-
lespie hall. The party will take

nurses will also attend the tea, in
addition to students in the School
of Nursing.

Dental Rays Features Article
On Spiral Spring Artificial Teeth

January issue of Dental Rays, student-alumni quarterly of the Den-
tal School, is off the press and features an article that will bring consolation
to those who have gone through the ordeal of having their incisors and

molars replaced with store teeth.

Rays has reprinted a tale of the
trials and tribulations of one Major
Jack Webster with the spiral spring
artificial teeth. The original article
appeared in the September 27, 1834,
edition of the Saturday Evening
Post. It is the story of the gentle-
man’s troubles which began with
the original beeswax mold that al-
most strangled the hero, to the
final plates of metal and springs
with the teeth that “ought to have
been lying quietly with their orig-
inal owners in some neighboring
churchyard.”

Embarrassing moments complete
the story in which the far from
proud owner ﬁnds more difficulty
than the usual owner in keeping
them in his oral cavity.

That’s just the beginning.

 

Carley Announces
Rules for Second
Semester Rushing

Second semester rushing period
ofﬁcially begins at 8 o’clock, Thurs-
day morning, February 20, and will
continue until 2 o’clock Sunday
morning, February 23, announces
Robert M. Corley, assistant dean of
men.

Prior to this time no fraternity
member or pledge is permitted to
approach new students on fraternity
matters or invite him to a frater-
nity house, or entertain him in any
way.

The silence period in which fra-
ternities submit sealed bids to the
ofﬁce of the dean of men, begins at
2 o’clock on Sunday morning, Feb-
ruary 23, and ends on Wednesday
evening, February 26, at 5 o’clock.
During this period fraternity mem-
bers or pledges are not permitted
to approach in any way newly reg-
istered students.

Bonwell, the Great, probably the
most eccentric dental scientist who
ever lived, is discussed by Dr. R.
Wassae Ohl, ’36, who originally
penned the sketch as a senior thesis
for the department of Prosthesis
(it says here).

Also featured is an article on the
museum of the School of Dentistry,
which has recently been assigned
adequate space for display of the
history of full denture prosthesis and
the development of anesthesis.
Charles E. Friesell, assistant pro-
fessor in the School of Dentistry
gives a description of the contests
of the museum and the type of work
it is doing.

Histories of the various dental
fraternities, libraries, students, and
alumni items, notes and announce-
ments of interest round out the
issue.

Students Rate
Potato Chips

Potato chips——crisp, salty, and
free—will be distributed at 12:30
o’clock Monday at every entrance of
the Cathedral and at Tuck shops.

Distributors will wear yellow
tags indicating that they are under-
graduate Owl salesmen, but selling
subscriptions to the Owl yearbook
is incidental, according to Hillard
Kreimer, BA42, donor of the chips,
and, incidentally, undergraduate
sales campaign manager.

Simply to bestow a gift on the
students is the idea, states Kreimer.

“But we would like to stress the
fact that the Owl represents a ﬁrst
and only edition and there will be
only one printing; so all you under-
graduates had better get your sub-
scriptions from the salesmen with
the yellow badges,” asserts Kreimer.

“Now is the time to buy—and you
are welcome to the potato chips,”
he added.

The yearbook sells for $3.50, $1.50
of which must be paid when the
book is ordered.

Incidentally, the yearbook sales
campaign begins this week.

No beverage will be served.

Pamphlets Explain N utionulity
Rooms’ Background to Students

The ﬁrst of a series of nationality room pamphlets intended to ac-
quaint students and faculty with the nationality rooms of the University‘
are being distributed this week to students who attend a class in the-
Swedish: RU-551311, Scottish, and Czechoslovak classrooms.

Students who do not have a class
in any of these classrooms may
purchase the pamphlets for ﬁve
cents each at the information room
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

The booklets which are being dis-
tributed by instructors in the re-
spective nationality classrooms con-
tain descriptions of the room, sig-
niﬁcance of the structure and the
purpose of the establishment of the
room.

Because of the expense of giving
booklets to all students, only those
who have classes in the nationality
room will be given the pamphlets.
The booklets are sold at cost.

The purpose of the publication of
the booklets, one of which will be
written for each of the nationality
rooms, is to create an interest in
not only the structure of the rooms,
