WASHINGTON, D.C. — Hundreds
of thousands of people traveled to
the nation’s capital Monday for
President Barack Hussein Obama
to take his second oath of office and
deliver his inaugural address, dur-

ing which he spoke of the obstacles.

ahead, both foreign and domestic,
including gay marriage. 4

“Our journey is not complete
until our gay brothers and sisters
are treated like anyone else under
the law,” Obama said, marking the
ﬁrst time a president has broached
the topic of gay marriage during an
inaugural address. “For if we are
truly created equal, then surely the

love we commit. to one another must

be equal, as well.”

People of all different ethnici-
ties, backgrounds and races packed
the National Mall all the way to the
Washington Monument on a chilly
day to watch Obama, 51, take the
oath of ofﬁce at about 11:50 a.m.,
officially making him president for
another four years. Washington
officials estimated on Sunday that
between 500,000 and 700,000
people would attend the event. ‘

Obama’s inaugural speech,
compared to his speech four years
ago, took a more aggressive tone.
The president outlined where the
country needs to see progress, es-
pecially in matters of equality — a

topic of particular signiﬁcance as V

day set aside to honor Martin Lu-

around 5 a.m. Screens were set up
all along the Mall to allow all in at-

stretched back miles away from the
Capitol building, ﬁlling out the Na-
tional Mall.

Celebrities, including Eva Long-
oria, Kelly Clarkson and coupleJay—
Z and Beyonce, were invited to sit
near the president, his Cabinet, and
members of Congress. Clarkson
sang “My Country, ’Tis of Thee,” and
Beyonce sang the National Anthem.

Out on the Mall, college students

that attended the inauguration. Bri-
anna Chen, a senior at'Princeton
University studying linguistics, was
one of those early risers who staked
a spot just yards from the Capitol
building. ’

“My entire life I have waited to
come to the inauguration of a presi-
dent,” Chen said. “Whomever that
was, it did not matter to me. This
is history.” -

Chen was carrying six cups of hot
chocolate for her and her friends,
who were trying to stay warm in the
below-30—degree weather, when
she exclaimed, “I just love seeing the

“These are the ultimate stimulus

Every person at the event was
given an American ﬂag, and the
ﬂags could be seen waving all the
way from the Washington Monu-

Ferlo plans legislation
proposal to tax nonprofits

Megan Trimble
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt and other large local nonproﬁt institutions
could soon be forced to dish out a larger chunk
of change in taxes as a result of new legislation
in theP_ennsylvania State Legislature.

State Senatorjirn Ferlo, D—Highland Park, S

announced earlier last week that he plans to
introduce legislation that would employ a’l0.4
percent payroll preparation tax on Pittsburgh
nonproﬁts with more than 250 employees. Be-
cause of its focus on larger nonproﬁts, universi-
ties and medical centers will be among those
targeted within the city.

As a payroll preparation tax, the checks of '

employees will not be directly affected by the
proposal. Under a preparation tax, the total
payroll is calculated and multiplied by the per-
centage of the tax, indicating the amount that
the University owes to the city.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said it’s “prema-
ture” to comment on the legislation, because it
has yet to be submitted by the senator.

The proposal aims to shift a portion of the
responsibility from for—proﬁt entities through
a reduction of their taxation. The 0.55 percent
payroll preparationtaxfacingfor-proﬁts would
be reduced to 0.5.

Stephen Bruder, Ferlo’s chief of staff, said
the shift in taxation will promote a “shared re-
sponsibility” among nonproﬁts by replacing
the current program. iv

“We, in Pittsburgh, have for some time
debated how best to get revenue from larger
nonproﬁts, and we believe this is the fairest
mechanism to do so,” Bruder said. “The PILOT
programlis relatively ineffective.”

Under the current system, nonproﬁts make
voluntary payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT)
through the Pittsburgh Public Service Fund.
But according to Bruder, the system must be
changed because of anvexponential increase in
revenue among the institutions.

“What typically"conie"s to mind when one

thinks of a nonproﬁt isasmall social service

  tion, but they have transformed into

large corporationitype structures in today’s

world,” he saidA._“Now, we are" talking about A
A million—dollar salaryCEOs and hundreds of ,

millions [of dollars] in payroll.” .

Bruder said they’re still in the process of
ﬁnalizingthe numbers and projections associ-
ated with the proposal, but estimated thatthe
taxwould generate a net sum of $5 to $10 million
in annual city revenue.

Nonproﬁts employ a large portion of the
city’s workforce, and as_“centers of great eco-

_A,,Anomic activity,” as Bruder said, harbor a respon-

sibility to contribute monetarily to the city. He
said. this responsibility applies to Pitt.

“Itwill require the University to juggle some ‘

resources, but we believe they have those re-
sources readily at hand to mitigate any potential
challenges,” he said. '

Joanna Doven, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl’s press secretary, said Ravenstahl has
not yet reviewed Ferlo’s plan but is looking for-
ward to doing so.

According to Bruder, Ferlo has sent out a let-
ter to fellow senators askingfor co—sponsorship
of the bill and is in the process of ﬁnalizing the
language. Ferlo is tentatively projected to in-
troduce the legislation before the end of the
month, at which point it will undergo a com-
mittee review. I

OBAMA

The theme of the inauguration was “Faith
in America’s Future,” and many younger mem-
bers of the crowd spoke of their own hope in
the future of the country.

Pitt freshman Sarah Collins expressed
hope for Obama’s second term and the cur-
rent state of the job market.

“I think the job market is going to be al-
ways changing in parallel to the needs of the
people and economy, whether that’s a good
thing or not,” Collins said. “I’m deﬁnitely

tentative and practical in thinking about my
future, perhaps compromising some bigger
dreams in the process. But in my eyes, that’s

just being responsible, and giving back to
the country that allowed me to grow up so
happily and freely.”
Collins, a Rockville, Md., native, added,
“I am here because I couldn’t be happier that
Obama was re-elected. I think he has so much
to give our nation, he just needs more time
— no one can ﬁx the country in four years.”
Chris Carl, a sophomore political science
and economics major at George Washington
University, said businesses went from a period
of making large cuts in jobs before Obama’s
presidency to hiring people a few years after
he took office. He also articulated what Obama
needs to do in his second term. A
“Obama, as a leader, has to address the
nation as is, not as we hope it could be,” Carl
said. I

“Dr. King’s vision for everyone was.in-
clusivity,”Williams-Moore said. “We try t
honor that legacy each year.’-’ A ‘
In addition to the Friday night interfaith
service, a national day of service took place
Monday morning with a candlelight vigil
later that evening. A symposium and lecture
will be held later in the week on‘Thursday

morning, and a brunch and shabbat will be .

hosted on Friday. A . .
The featured event of the week-long
celebration will be a speech on Thursday
evening by author and activist Angela Davis.
Sherdina Harper, coordinator of the
CCLD, said the annual" interfaith service
allows the community to come together.
Student organizations involved included
Ano_inted Steps of Faith, Rainbow Alliance,

Black Action Society, Someof God’s Chil- I

dren Gospel Choir, Global Ties and Campus

Women’s Organization. A '
“It gives us the opportunity to be uniﬁed,

regardless of cultural or religious back-

grounds, in order to honor a man who spoke .

for all mankind,” Harper said.

' Pitt’s Student Government Board Presi-
dent, Gordon Louderback, served as the.
event’s master of ceremonies. In his intro-
duction, he recognized that the Martin Lu-
ther Kingjr. celeb rations over the weekend

coincide with the 100-year anniversaryAof V
‘the fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha, the ﬁrst mi-
A nority organization ever recognized by Pitt.

The evening included a number of per-
formances and speeches. A A

Sharon Scuoteguazza of~Mount Ararat
Dance Ensemble performed. a liturgical
dance —. a particular expression of wor-
ship — and Some of God’s Children Gospel"
Choir performed two songs.

Additionally, Anointed Steps of Faith
gave a stepping performance, explaining
that they were “a body of believers who
step for their beliefs.” The steppers created
music with their voices and bodies — clap-
ping with their hands, on their legs_and
even on the pews in front of them.

Various student leaders of campus orga-
nizations also spoke in reference to King’s
life and legacy. ,

Sophomore psychology major Ken Wu
spoke on behalf of the Global Ties orga-
nization by sharing his background as an
international student from China.

Wu explained that he ﬁrst learned about
King in middle school and -constantly con-
fused him with the German priest, Martin
Luther. But when Wu became an exchange
student in the United States at age 16, he
learned more about King’s legacy.

membrances. Zach Schaffer | Staff Photographer

Wu recalled volunteering for a day of
service in honor of MLK Day at Pitt last year.

“I enjoyed carrying a huge trash bag,”
he said. “People gave me warm smiles. It
was the best prize for committing to public
service.” A ‘P

Wu spoke about how King’s efforts were
pertinent to his own life as a ﬁrst-genera-
tion college student. ‘ '

“It reminds me of why I’m here,” he said.
“Nothing comes to life in a second. Without
the march on Washington, the ‘I ‘Have a
Dream’ speech and other efforts, society
would be so different.”

Emma Steinmetz, the community out-
reach chair from Campus Women’s Orga-

_ nization, spoke of King in regard to her

work with CWO. She spoke of examples of
violence against women and her reactions
of rage. She added that she hopes to follow
King’s example. .

“He had an emphasis on peaceful pro-
test and never wavered in his dedication to
nonviolence,” she said.

Cameron Taylor of the Rainbow Alliance
also provided the audience with a speech
on ﬁghting for ourdignity. _

“We need to acknowledge we deserve our
rights before ﬁghting for them,” she said.

Ta Misha Bascombe, president of the
Black Action Society, chose to draw on vari-
ous quotes from King, while also providing
listeners with powerful words of her own.

“I believe in love. I don’t care what color
or race you are. It’s all beautiful,” she said,
echoing the deceased King. I

\ Until gender equality is achieved,

Women are not equal to men in '
many ways.

Women earn 77 cents for ev-
ery dollar a man earns.

Women are less represented
in American politics (they hold
18.3 percent of Congressional
seats, while men hold 81.7 per-
cent).

Women’s appearances are
judged more critically than
men’s. When was the last time
you saw the headline: “Photo
Special: Male Stars Without
Make-Up” or “Bill Clinton
Wears Panitsuit?” .

in America'n society where we

COLUMN“ .

Science should cl

0 more than cure cancer

 . 2 I Rohith Palli
1 ‘Columnist

~.

Think for a moment about the last couple
of scientiﬁc discoveries you have read
about originating in the United States.

How many were biomedical? How
many were in the physical sciences or in
green energy?

If you are thinking about the discover-
ies at the Large Hadron Collider that have
tentatively proven the existence of the

_Higgs boson, you aren’t thinking about a

U.S. science project.

_ If you are thinking about the Mars
rover landing, you aren’t thinking about a
science advancement, but rather a marvel
of modern engineering.

If you are thinking about anything else,
it’s probably in medicine or biology. Don’t

. worry —— it’s not because you are scien-

. tiﬁcally illiterate. It’s because you live in

a country that really likes funding and
discussing medical research.

Consider a ﬁeld like chemistry, which
in recent years has become very medi-
cally oriented. For instance, the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry this year was awarded
for the discovery of G-prote_in—coupled
receptors, a class of proteins that play a
central role in cell signaling and environ-
mental response. This sounds like biology
because it is.

In fact, ﬁve of the last 10 Nobel prizes
in chemistry have been awarded for mo-
lecular or structural biology. These prizes
are for fundamental discoveries and are
reﬂective of many scientists, especially
in the U.S., doing excellent biochemistry
research.

This is not necessarily because there
is no “old-fashioned” chemistry research
occurring. Instead, it is because current
funding practices have led to an under-
appreciation of nonbiological sciences

in the 21st century. '

According to the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, in
2012 the National Institutes of Health, the
sole source offederal science funding for

___cl_')iological‘ sciences,‘ had almost sixtimes
the funding of the far broader National

Science Foundation. Nonscience military
research and development spending also
outpaced NSF funding 2—to—1.
Personally, I’m extremely delighted to
spend twice as much money learning how
to kill people than learning how to save

people. And I’m even happier to spend

six times more on learning how to save
people than learning how to improve gen-

eral quality of life.

This is a highly imbalanced system,

 but not because too much money is be-

ing spent on biomedical research. It is
imbalanced because, just as we have failed
to reinvest in roads, we have failed to re-
invest in all science. .

This is especially true in areas tha
are currently particularly underfunded,
speciﬁcally sustainable energy and the
physical sciences. Reaching our full po-
tential in these areas will not only lay the
groundwork for resurgence of high—skill
jobs in the U.S. by building human capital
butvwill also provide an economic boost
here and now. ' '

In 2012, nondefense federal research
spending constituted less than .5 percent
of the total U.S. economy. In the late ’6os,

the federal economic contribution as ya’

share of the economy was double this._Is
science half as important today as it was
in the ’60s? 5
While the share of the budget going
toward research has decreased, defense

research spending has remained higher

than nondefense research spending. This
Cold War mentality has gone on far too
long. The United State’s research defense
budget alone exceeds the entire defense

budgets of every country except China-

I suggest we immediately cut defense
research and development and instead
make a commitment to increasing sci-
ence funding.

We must, however, be judicious about
how this increased funding is distributed.

We can’t just inject short bursts: When
the NIH budget was famously doubled

from 1999. 2oo‘§,jé1i}:fthé‘fii'nas, were‘

Graphlc:_Nick S.tamatakiS'_and Bohicth F'a_,|l‘ig.

 

spent in a ﬁve-year span. _'1_‘his led"ﬁrst-
time funding request approvals to sky-
rocket to 27.1 percentlin 2001, only to
drop off sharply to 15.3 percent in 2012.
’ Funding must remain constant to al-
low the same quality of projects to make
it through each year. The 10 percent of
proposals rejected in.2012 that would
have been accepted in 2001 are no less
meritorious. ~ I . ‘ ' '1
As we increase funding forother re-
search agencies, itdis critical to‘ commit
to increasing their budgets over» the long
term rather than through short-term jolts.
By tipping fundin_g.rates so 20 percent of
first-time requests get funding over the
next 30 years, we would do a. lot more
good than by jumping approval ratesfto
25 percent for the next ﬁve years. a A
Additional funding should come —with

I an additional rule: All publications prd-‘

duced by government-funded research
must have the ﬁnal version placed in an
open-access government depository (like
PubMed) within six months. This would be
an improvement over current NIH policy,
which keeps articlesgated for 12 months.
Research paid for by the public shouldn’t

be restricted from the public for a whole

year. 5 . .
Ultimately, thesevchanges will create a
research infrastructure within which_the
scientiﬁc community can thrive. But a new
research infrastructure will also require»
new, brilliant scientists.

. To attract these types of_students away
from medicine, computer science or ﬁ-

’ nance e fields which offer similar chal-
lenges _with' greater ﬁnancial compensa-,_
» tionthan standard science — we must"
- _ offer higher salaries, greater respect and
intellectual freedom. .  ' 

1’ Higher salaries should be built into
an increase in funding. This is easy. How
to offer respect and intellectual freedom
are the hard challenges that must be met
if the U.S. is to continue to lead in science
and technology. ﬂ

Skateboarding, hip-hop foster artistic expression similarly

Jeff Ihaza
Szfqff Wr,z'ter

My appreciation for hip-hop came as a result
of skateboarding. I was fascinated with the
creative ways that the so—called rappers at

my high school made ﬁin of us skateboarders. A

This was of course before Odd Future — a
group of Los Angeles skaters who also create
rap music — and well before Lil Wayne made
appearances in skate videos.

The two lifestyles are under an interesting
and entirely unexpected spotlight and have
recently collaborated to form groups that
combine them.

Skateboarding has crossed boundaries to
make appearances in less traditional places.
Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles is adorned with a

giant Diamond Supply Co. billboard. The same as

company that made maddeningly complicated
skateboard hardware for grungy kids who
didn’t shower and hung out with bums has
its logo sprawled above the glitzy cityscape.
It’s almost surreal.

Similarly, hip—hop’s mainstream appeal
comes as somewhat of a surprise, considering
the genre was once marred by violence and
negative public perception.

What’s even more fascinating is how these
two worlds that couldn’t seem more different
from each other are increasingly becoming

intertwined. In the music video for 2 Chainz’s
“No Lie,” there is a slow—motion shot of profes-
sional skateboarder Theotis Beasley doing a
kickflip. This 2 Chainz video regularly airs on
Black Entertainment Television (BET), which
frequently features rap and hip-hop music.

Growing up, I would have never imagined
this sort of collaboration. A

It makes sense, though. As skateboarders,
we wore tight pants and listened to weird mu-
sic. We snuck out of class usingthe same escape
routes as the so—called gangsters and “future
rappers.” It was only a matter of time until the
groups would cross paths on the road leading
farthest from authority ﬁgures. Of course, the
Internet helped, too.

The racial undertones that exist in both

‘ _l spheres can’t be ignored either. Skateboarding
7 was once relegated to sunny California beach

communities not known for diversity, and
made up of predominantly white-residents.
Slowly but surely, the sport made its way to
the streets, unregulated, and skate rats could
pick up a board in any neighborhood, in any
city and make something from nothing.
Skateboarding relies on the same hip -hop
ethic, the idea of being in complete control
of artistic expression. Skater Stevie Williams
calls himself j‘the]ay—Z of skateboarding” and

Ihaza D 11 V Skateboarding meets hip-hop in a congiomeration of sportand music. MCLT Carnpusl

who let the dogs out. And appar-

But that’s the beauty of this

Stapp and belt out “Can you take
me higher?” over and over again.
Stapp has to smoke at least four
packs of cigarettes a day. There’s
no other reason for a human be-
ing to have a voice that awesome.
It’s gravelly, it’s masculine and it
sounds like a freight train that’s
coming off the tracks.

And listen, this isn’t an en-

tobacco is still a bad idea, kids.
But sometimes I feel like sacriﬁc-

so I could have a voice that angelic.

behavioral changes as the days shortened,
and he began losing the drive and enthu-
siasm that welcomed him every spring
and summer.

“As the days get shorter in winter and
fall, the risk of SAD increases and it may
be because people are exposed to less
light from the environment,” Roecklein
said. “The hypothesis is that people who
are at risk may be less sensitive to light.”

And it’s not an uncommon phenom-
enon, she said. Most people feel differ-
ent when the temperature starts to drop
and leaves fall. It’s normal, and there’s a
spectrum that everybody fits into.

“We estimate that 7 percent will have
severe enough changes that it reaches the
diagnostic threshold for seasonal depres-
sion,” Roecklein said. “But there would
also be quite a few people that have less
severe symptoms. And it’s important to
know that there are levels of severity
that are just as serious as non—seasonal
[clinical] depression.”

Unfortunately, there’s a stigma at-
tached to SAD that makes it difficult for
people to recognize it as a legitimate ail-
ment.

“It is an absolutely real condition,”
Zukor said. “It’s a physical change in our
body’s chemistry.”

of psychotherapy conducted by a psy—.

chologist or therapist.

“It involves addressing a lot of the fac-
tors we believe are important in depres-
sion,” Roecklein said. “Such as negative

cognitions — expecting to feel poorly ,

in winter and not being able to function
as well — and maladaptive behaviors —
not going out to see friends or exercising
because of energy levels. We try to help
people reverse those trends.” V
_ Social activity can be great for mental
health, she added. »It’s a stress reliev-
er. The technical phrase “tapping into
your social network” means hanging out
with your friends —- going out—at night
or catching lunch with a buddy between
classes. ' ~
Stress nibbles at all students from time

to time, but for those burdened with SAD, V

itcantrigger a state of mental and emo-
tional paralysis. The Stress Free Zone,
an organ of the University Counseling
Center,.encourages “mindfulness,” of-
fering meditation, yoga classes and a web
page for downloading relaxation audio
clips — simple things that help people
find some harmony so they can go out
and interact with others.

And for people likelthe downtrodden
freshman looking longingly down at the
grey Pittsburgh streets, SAD‘ can com-
pletelyynumb the desire for socialization.
He doesn’t want to go to the -gym, and he
doesn’t want to see the friends he made
during the frivolous first few weeks of
his collegiate career.

Fortunately though, his story doesn’t

end there. Toward the end of the win-
ter, he’ll reach out to various services
on campus and speak with a psychiatrist
back home. He’ll unstrap, himself from
the baggage of SAD. _

He’s ajunior now. He has a light box
that brightens his room every morning,
and he exercises four times a week. He
knows when he needs to take a break from
studying to hang out with his friends,
and he visits the Stress Free Zone during
ﬁnals. And even on not-so-sunny morn-
ings, his bed, doesn’t hold on too tightly.

When the winter
months have you
stuck in your bed,
make sure you're
noticing the signs
of SAD and treating
them properly to
get back to yourself.

homeless Philadelphia kid started an empire
named““Dirty Ghetto Kids.” If Jay-Z were a
skateboarder, he’d have made the same move.

The skating clothing has become the closest
relation to the rap world, and, rather quickly,
skate brands such as Supreme, Diamond Sup-
ply, Vans and Huf have become stalwarts in the
rap community. These brands, started and run
by skateboarders, are a part of the hip—hop
ethic and appeal to rappers because of their
similar independent production.

This might explain the frequency of skate
themes in so many modern rap movements.

Odd Future’s aesthetic, wholly reliant on skate
culture and built around skateboarders, is

one of a number of skate forays into the rap

industry. It’s a natural progression that led
to East Coast counterweight Pro Era, a group
headed by Joey Bada$$, which has a similar
skate—centered niche. Much like the differ-

ences betweenrap music from either coast,

these two groups highlight the multitude of
aesthetics in skateboarding depending on

location. ~

The parallels between these two worlds

highlight a shift in societal acceptance, where-

as rap music and skateboarding once shared
a sort of ostracization from the mainstream.

Today, however, their DIY ethic has created a
new mainstream. m.

The Pitt men’s basketball team (15—4,
3-3 Big East) won arguably its biggest
game of the season to date on Satur-
day, with the Panthers beating the
Connecticut Huskies (12-5, 2-3), 69-
61, by again using a run in the home
stretch to take control of the contest.

Just as in Wednesday’s game atVil-
lanova —- when-Pitt outscored Nova

15-0 in the game’s ﬁnal minutes —.

Pitt commandeered an -11-3 run to
ﬁnish the game after UConn’s Ryan
Boatright tied the contest. at 58-all
with 4:09 left to play in the game.

In those last four minutes, the
Pitt defense prevented the Huskies
from making another ﬁeld goal, while
Pitt went 6-for-6 from the free throw
line to seal the victory atthe Petersen
Events Center. ‘

Once again, the difference Satur-
day afternoon for head coachjamie

Dixon came down to rebounding. For.

the third time in conference play, Pitt

out-rebounded its opponent and, as

a result, picked up its third confer-
ence win. '

“A great job rebounding by us,
which is what we’ve been emphasiz-
ing. And we know when we don’t, we
come up short,” Dixon said. “We took
care of the ball, [and I] thought we
moved the ball well in the ﬁrst half.”

as many as 14, Pitt angson to beat UConn

Overall, Pitt held an 11-rebound
advantage against Connecticut, 38-27.

Dixon thought some defensive
rnixups and foul trouble contributed
to his team blowing a 13-point half-
time advantage.

“Second half, we didn’t do what

‘we needed to do,” he said. “Zone
,didn’t work —- it worked well in the
. ﬁrst half. Obviously, it didn’t work as

well to start the second half. We had
some guys in foul trouble. We had to
get through some minutes with that,
andiit didn’t wo rk to__ou,r advantage.”

‘ . — 'Pitt’s second unit helped to coun-
ter UConn’s second-halfrun, by con-
tributinghzo points to the Panthers’

_ cause. ‘

“I thought our bench was ter-
riﬁc, with Dante [Taylor] down the
stretch,” Dixon said.

Leading the way off the bench
with his energy was senior forward
Dante Taylor, who scored six points
and pulled in seven rebounds. On

' consecutive possessions in the ﬁnal

minutes, Taylor’ found freshman
point guard James Robinson in the
corner for a3—pointer, knocked down
a pair of clutch free throws and rattled
home a 15-foot jumpshot.

“I’m just a guy that’s gonna come
in and play,” Taylor said. “I try to be a
motivator and positive on the ﬂoor.”

Potential and identity

of men’s  

basketball team still unclear D

Jeremy Tepper
Staﬂ PVrz'zfer

The Pitt men’s basketball team has
played 19 games, and I’m still not
sure if it’s any good.

Going into the season, I was
convinced that this team was dif-
ferent than last year’s disappoint-
ment. The talent infusion of Steven
Adams, James Robinson and Trey
Zeigler was too great for Pitt not to
easily return to the Big Dance.

But things haven’t developed
quite like I thought.

Similar to last season, this cur-
rent team possesses the frustrating
habit of taking two steps back after
taking one step forward.

After starting off the season 12-

1, with their only loss coming in a
close bout against top-ﬁve Michi-
gan, I was sure the Panthers were
destined to ﬁnish at the top of the
Big East.

But then they dropped two very
winnable games in a row. The ﬁrst
at home versus a solid Cincinnati
team, and the other on the road
against a mediocre Rutgers squad.

I was having ﬂashbacks to last
season. Out of nowhere, however,

the Panthers dominated a ranked

Georgetown in an away game.

My hope was restored, but soon
buried after a disappointing home
loss against Marquette. It was then
rejuvenated once again following
two solid wins against Villanova

and Connecticut. .

Needless to say, this Pitt team
(15-4, 3-3 Big East) is unpredict-
able. So instead of trying to antici-
pate where’ this rollercoaster ride
is heading next, it’s easier to an-
swer the questions weighing_on the
minds of Pitt fans.

Most importantly, what is
wrong with Pitt and how can it be
ﬁxed?

Dribble penetration

The players can’t stop it and
can’t produce it. Going into the
season, many had anticipated that
Zeigler would be able to spearhead

Second-half comeback
effort falls short for Pitt

Dave Uhrmacher '
Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball Big
East Conference losing streak
grew to 22'on Saturday, as the
Panthers lost to the Marquette

~ Golden Eagles, 74-65, at the Pe-
tersen Events Center.

After the game appeared to
be a blowout, the Panthers’ (9-
8, 0-4 Big East) inspired -sec-
ond-half performance fell just
short of a victory. But spirits
are high for the remainder of
the Big East schedule.

“We, as a staff, see the matu-
rity happening, and the results
are the same,” Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato said following

the game. “But we have to keep
getting better and better. When
we start two freshmen, two

. sophomores and a junior, and

a whole bunch of kids offithe
bench, we just have to stick to
our system. I think the team is
enjoying playing together, and
we all understand what_we want
to do.” ‘

A ‘ pair of Brianna Kiesel
buckets gave Pitt a 4-0 advan-
tage early, but after a Marquette
layup by Katherine Plouffe at
14:44 in the ﬁrst half, the Pan-
thers would fail to reclaim the
lead for therest of the game.

from Marquel Davis to’ Kie-

sel with 9:35 to go in the first
frame cut the lead to five, the
closest the Panthers could get
to the Golden Eagles in the first
half.

A scrappy play by sopho-
more center Chyna Golden on
the offensive glass led to a Lo-
liya Briggs layup- just before
time expired in the first half.
The Briggs basket narrowed the
Golden Eagles’ lead to 40-34
headed into the break.

For the second straight
game, the Panthers "struggled
on the defensive end," allowing
Marquette (1o—7, 2-2 Big East)
to score 44 points in the paint-
ed area. On the offensive end,
the Panthers failed to‘ convert
free throws, ’ only converting
eight of 20 attempts from the
line. _

Back-to-back natural three-

” point plays from Kiesel and

Briggs fueled a second-half run.

A Davis fast break jumper
brought the score to 64-63 with
3:50 to go.

“I just shot it with conﬁ-
dence. I assumed she was ex—
pecting me to drive all the way
and I thought, ‘If I am going to

take this shot, I better nail it.’”
The Panthers failed to con-
vert on the offensive end down
the stretch. A combination of
poor shot selection by Pitt in
the final four minutes and a
10-point run by the hot-shoot-
ing Golden_ Eagles sealed the

‘ victory for Marquette.

Plouffe led Marquette in re-
bounds (9) and assists (8) to go

_along with her 13 points.

Four Pitt players finished the
game in double figures, paced
by Kiesel’s 18 points. Cora Mc-
Manus led the team with nine
rebounds to go along with her
15 points. a _

“I think what -I take from
this game is that we just have to
play hard every possession, and
that every possession counts.
When we got it within one, we
had that definite ‘Yes, we are
in it’ feeling, and we can trans-
fer that over to our upcoming
games.” ' - _

the Panthers’ dribble penetra-
tion attack. Unfortunately, he has
struggled for the most part, forcing
Tray Woodall to start and log major
minutes at shooting guard (26.9 to
15.9 per game). Lacking a consis-
tently effectivevdriyver, Pitt’s offense
has a tendency to go stagnant at
times. With Woodall not playing his
natural position, this has also led to

problems on defense. He has faced
major difficulties, often failing to

‘ ’ keep his man in front of him.

Fortunately, there seem to ‘be
realistic solutions to this problem.

On offense, Zeigler has begun to

ﬁnd his stride. Looking drastically
more comfortable and conﬁdent,
Zeigler has been a positive force

i ever. the last three games, scoring
”most~of his’ points off the bounce.
Additionally, Robinson, Durand

Johnson and Lamar Patterson all
look to be .capable drivers when
they are aggressive enough.

On the defensive end, the issues

also seem to be rectiﬁable. The ob-

vious solution is to play better man-
to-man defense. As long as the play-
ers stay in position and switch well,
shortcomings in quickness can be
made up. If they can’t do that, then
.a more heavy usage of zone defense
could work. With ample length and

a big-time shot blocker in Adams, a
zone should be effective in concept,
if practiced more.

Rebounding and toughness

Rebounding and toughness
have been trademarks of the pro-
gram under head coach Jamie
Dixon. Although many past teams
lacked talent, they could steal
games by outworking teams on the
boards and in the pursuit of loose
balls. For whatever reason, though,
this Pitt team hasn’t lived up to
standards in these areas. Although
it has plenty of size, Pitt has often
been outrebounded and outworked
against talented opponents.

The solution to these struggles
isn’t exactly complex. It goes no
ﬁlrther than working harder and

asserting its physicality more

prominently. Grabbing rebounds
and loose _balls is mostly about ef-
fort, not talent. As long as Pitt ex-
erts maximum effort and throws
around their size, they should be
more than ﬁne.

Lack of identity

Nothing in particular re-
ally characterizes what this team
wants to do on offense. If anything,
they’re a bunch of unselﬁsh players
who want to continuously defer to
each other. As of now, neither the
frontcourt nor the backcourt is
productive enough to be consid-

ered a go-to unit. This is an obvious
problem, as without a go-to player
or strategy, the offense will often
run itself down to the ﬁnal seconds
of the shot clock.

Luckily, it seems that solutions
are beginning to become evident.
Although Pitt will likely not have a
go-to scorer this year, it can have
multiple capable scorers. From the
backcourt, Woodall, Patterson and
Robinson have recently started
to look for their shots more fre-
quently. Additionally, Zeigler and
Johnson have started to ﬁnd their
stride off the bench. In the front-

court, Talib Zanna has been a solid '

scoring threat most of the year. But
if this unit is going to thrive, Ad-
ams will have to become a capable
scoring threat. He’s looking more

comfortable and getting more post '

feeds, so now it’s just up to ﬁnishing
his looks. .

If Pitt continues to‘ struggle in

half—court offense, it would make
sense for Dixon’ to have his players
get out in transition and run more.
A big positive of this team is that
every player is an athlete that can
get out and run. With a couple of
true point guards in Robinson and
Woodall and plenty of athleticism
on the roster, Pitt has the ingredi-
ents to be highly successful both in

* transition and overall. I

«With Taylor’s points, ‘Pitt pulled
out to a comfortable 65-59 lead and
coasted to the ﬁnish. In conjunction,

junior guard Trey Zeigler followed
up his breakout performance at Vil-

. lanova with 23 quality minutes off

the bench, scoring eight points and
playing solid» defense. ‘

For the Huskies, Boatright put up
a game—high20 points —— albeit on 19
ﬁeld-goal attempts. Alongside him,
Omar Calhoun tallied 14points ofhis
own with a 5-for-11 shooting perfor-
mance, making three 3-pointers.

Boatright did most of his damage

. in the second  scoring 16 points
highlighted by his and-one at the2t:10 '

mark in the second half to level the
contest. From there, he hurt Pitt no
longer as the Panthers ‘changed up
their scheme and kept UConn from
penetratingatthe degree to which the
Huskies were able throughout most
of the second half. '

“We made a couple adjustments _

guarding the ball screen at the end,

and I thought that helped because

they were hurting us,” Dixon said.
ForPitt, redshirt junior small for-

ward Lamar Patterson led the way
with°a super-efﬁcient14'points, at-
taining his total with 4-for-9 shoot-
ing while making two of his three at-
tempts from distance and notching
ﬁve assists. Senior point guard Tray
Woodall chipped in 13 points of his
own alongside a game—high six as-
sists, while Robinson added 12, mak-
ing four free throws in the waning
minutes of the game to help Pitt put
the game away.

“We were runningalotfrom miss-
ing free throws,” Woodall said about
practice this past week. The nmning
paid off rather marginally overall,
with Pitt shooting 65.2 percent from
the free throw line. ‘

But Pitt’s free-throw shooting
was highlighted by the team going

. 12-for-15 from the charity stripe in the

second half, which provided a huge
lift to the Panthers’ efforts to shut the
door on the Huskies. ’

UConn head coach Kevin Ollie ex—
pressed disappointment in his team’s
ﬁrst-halfperforrnance, saying that the
Huskies did not compile the kind of
performance necessary to defeat Pitt
on its home ﬂoor.

“Second half, our guys came out
and responded the right way, got in
the game, got it tied twice, but we
couldn’t get a stop at the end,” Ollie

said. “We have to play hard. We have
to play for 40 minutes, and I thought
we only played for 20. You can’t do
that in the Big East.”

Ollie also addressed questions
about guard Shabazz Napier, who
suffered a shoulder injury against
Louisville, but Ollie said Napier was
“100 percent” for Saturday’s game.

Boatright disagreed.

“Shabazz’s shoulder is hurt. As
anyone could tell, he wasn’t himself,”
Boatright said.

Napier expanded upon the com-
ment, saying, “I couldn’t dribble with
my left hand.”

Napier’s injury limited his offen-
sive performance, and he converted
only two of seven ﬁeld goal attempts
— two 3—pointers — and ﬁnished
with just eight points, well below his

17.1 points-per-game average.

Coach Dixon will undoubtedly
want his improving team to rebound
well again on Tuesday night at Prov-
idence as the Panthers look to win

_ their third consecutive Big East game.

“I seem to be the only one empha-
sizing that, or do it more than others.

That’s where it lies —— possessions,” -

Dixon said. “If we get more rebounds,
we’ll havefarmore possessions than
our opponents. That, to me, is the
key.”
