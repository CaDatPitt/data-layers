giving dates so signiﬁcant, maybe
leap year was oveirlooked. '

Last year, the number of those
listed as married was 521. This

T,imc.CapsuleReplica in Show at Planetarium
Contains Baseball, Pair of Dice, Prayer Book

By Clifford Gershovitz ‘

A replica of the Westinghouse
Time Capsule which appeared at
the New York World’s Fair is now
on exhibition at the Buhl plane-
tarium on the North Side.

This part of the exhibit is ‘a
seven—foot copper “letter” ad-
dressed to the citizens of the Uni-
verse in 6939 AD. The capsule
contains culture items for the resi-
dents of a future world including
a baseball, a pair of dice. a watch,
a ﬂashlight. rouge, powder and lip-
stick, and a hat especially designed
by Lily Dache.

Among the archeologists and
others who contributed to the Cap-
sule was Dr. Jotham Johnson, in-

structor in the department of
classirrs.

When a=ked to state what he
considered the most signiﬁcant

among the contents of the Capsule,
Dr‘; Johnson replied. “Thea real
problem that arose was to ﬁnd some
xvay of enabling the Americans of
6939 to..read English.
change from century to century and

Languages it - I

if there is one thing certain about
6939 AD it is that the inhabitants
of Brooklyn will not be able to
speak, read or understand English
as it is spoken today.”

“Therefore, in the Capsule was
placed a slim volume containing a
description of the Capsule itself,
and a Key to the English Language,
prepared by J . P. Harrington of the
Smithsonian institution in Wash,-
ington. which contains a phonetic
alphabet and a diagram with in-
structions for forming the 33 sounds
of English in the human throats, a
simple condensation of English
grammar, several pen and ink
drawings with the names of the
things in them labeled both in the
phonetic alphabet and in English,
the old folk fable of the Northwind
and the Sun translated into 25
languages, and a vocabulary of the
thousand most frequently used Eng-
lish words.”

“Also in the Capsule were placed
 Bible and a Prayer book-—thc
latter perhaps the »most important
of all because it contains the Lord’s

Prayer ‘translated into three hun-
dred of the several thousand lan-
guages in use in the world today.

In this way, no matter what lan-
guage is spoken 6939 AD or what
script it is written in, the ﬁnders
of the Capsule will be able to break
it down with the aid of this Super-
Rosetta Stone, and ultimately de-
cipher the entire documentary con-
tents of the Capsule.”

Eighteen hundred and ninety-
nine copies were printed on special
long—lasti.ng paper and ‘sent to li-
braries and museums all over the
world, with the request that they
be stored i.n as safe a place as the
state of the world permits until
the time to open the Capsule ar-
rives.

In case the volume becomes illeg-
ible, it is requested that the librari-
ans of that future day translate its
contents onto new paper and thus
help to perpetuate its instructions.
Most important of all, the book con-
tains elaborate measurements of
latitude and longitude.

Literary Faces Blush
As Pitt Meets B. I.

THE FIRST EMBARRASSING situation of
the school year, exclusive of a few exploding
cigars and some broken garters, took place last
Wednesday. q

We were standing around the News oﬂice
when the mail came in. Among the letters was
one addressed to the editor of the school literary
publication. .

Now this, of itself, is not especially embar-
rassing, unless one considers that there is no
literary publication at Pitt,’ obviating the fact
thatgvthere is no editor of the literary publica-
tion~at Pitt.

We opened the letter. It was from a Mr.
Russell J. Roy of Rhode Island State college.
-‘Mr. Roy wanted to be put on our exchange» list.

Rhode Island State"'”college is an institution
with less than seven hundred students. It has
a literary magazine. A V

The University of Pittsburgh is a large east-
ern schofdl with a regular enrollment of some
5500 students. It has a football team, class
dances, and no literary magazine.

Why should this be? Well, Pitt is one of
approximately a dozen universities in the United
States which operate in the black. It is quite
logical, therefore, that we should not intend to
knock our budget out of kilter by adding to our
ﬁnancial load the $90 that it would cost to pro-
mote such a magazine.

After all, we have been losing quite a bit of
money on some of our highly educational char-
acter—building dances.

Seriously, though, what seems to be the
trouble? Thehtrouble seems to be that the Eng-

lish majors at this school are not considered
very important.

These English majors, about 600 strong, are
expected to submit (in all senses of the word)
to professional magazines if they wish to see
their works in print. This competition may be
good for the ﬁbers, but there is not much mental
exhilaration to be found in waiting for the mail-
man to bring rejection slips.

Remembering the fate of the last Journeyman,
those who_ have been visiting the various mem-
bers of the publications board have attempted
to -iron out those things which apparently crip-
pled the 1937 issue. ’

The new plan is to make the tentative pub-
lication an al1—campus one. It will not be a
publicity organ for the members of Quill club
or. for any school organization. It will be pub-
lished under the sameiprinciples as are the News
and the Panther, differing only in purpose and
‘in content. _

. All submitted manuscripts will pass through
the hands of a board of faculty and student

members. ‘ This combination of fresh vision and .

conservative experience should result in a well-
balanced, lively but intelligent edition. ’
 All this," of course, has been pure conjecture,

based on the assumption that there will be a,

literary publication at Pitt.
Outlets have been granted for other forms

of art. There are exhibitions of painting, ‘sculp- :

ture shows, dramatics, debates, band concerts,‘
to name a very few.

If at all possible, we of the University of
Pittsburgh (42 stori.es, 5500 regular students)
would like to have one copy to send to Mr. Roy

of Rhode Island State college (642 students, 42
professors) .

' Press from “Washington”

In Washington for the past
months a study has been made of
college problems’brou_ght about by
the 1940 selective service act.

An agreement between national
educational and selective service
authorities (urging the immediate
occupational classification, of college
students» by local draft boards is
near the "announcement stage.

This agreement is the result of a
clash between two points of view,
One group believed that ALL stu-
dents who have completed a cer-
tain amount of higher education—

presumably two years—should be

allowed to continue until gradua-
tion.

The opposing group, which ap-
pears to have been the successful
one, believes such blanket defer-
ment cannot be maintained against
the opposition toward. class legisla-
tion. And they advocate shifting
the basis of student deferment from
a student- basis to an occupational
basis (individual deferment).

The change in classiﬁcation will
probably be on the basis of the ﬁeld
of education which the students are
now pursuing. Preference under
the new arrangement will presum-
ably be given students in medicine,
pharmacy, -dentistry, chemistry, en-
gineering, biology, geology and re-
lated research ﬁelds.

The new interpretation will hit
liberal arts students hard and per-
manently.

S: =E= =l<

Conscientious objectors seeking
cleferment will be asked (1) the na-
ture of their ‘anti-war beliefs, (2)
how, when, and from whom they
received their belief, (3) under
what circumstances they believe in
the use of force, (4) actions in their
past that demonstrate the depth of
their anti-war belief, (5) whether
they have given public expression
to their anti-war views, (6) creed
and I’ activities of religious organ)-

Surprise-Another

Viewing with Alarm~

Bob Hamilton

I View with alarm, to use the classic phrase, the
recent restrictions and red tape which have been im-
posed upon the ﬁrearms owners of America.

' Last spring our honored. President, using a very
ﬂimsy pretext based on the Christian Front treason
case, banned the further sale of government arms and
ammunition to citizens of the United States by the
director of civilian marksmanship. This sale of arms
service was inaugurated originally on the suggestion
of experienced army otlicers that the country needed
a nucleus of trained civilian riﬂemen around which an
army could be built in case of war. The service had
a fairly ancient and very honorable history. _

The President’s action was the starting gun, so to
so-eal<, and a wave of demands for anti-gun laws and
ﬁrearms registration swept the nation. In our own
state it was announced summarily that hunting licenses
would not be issued to applicants who did not register
all ﬁrearms in their possession. Strong protests made
the powers that be modify this to a “request” for such
information.

On. the Use of Citizens

Now I may be an alarmist, but it seems to me that
certain undercover groups are using innocent and
ignorant American citizens, in office and out, as their
front men. Itiis a matter of record that France, Ger-
many, and Italy were prepared in part for the groups
now in power by the removal of ﬁrearms from pri-
vate ownership. England today is broadcasting ap-
peals to the,U. S. to (donate guns and ammunition to
her, since by her restrictive ﬁrearms laws she has
checked the growth of private arms "and ammunition
companies, cut downavailable storage Jpl-aces for such
munitions, and prevented her "citizens from possessing
defensiveor offensive Weapons.’ _ _

The leader of thedrive to procure _firear_ms from
U. S. citizens for the Britishers said recently, in effect,
“We can use anything that willimake a noise and
throw a bullet.’’ The British plight is so desperate

;that even_mu.z_zle-loading riﬂes are being ‘accepted.

It is a major point of our Constitution. that “The

" right of the citizen to keep and bear arms shall rlbt be

infringed.” That right has already been infringed clon-
sidcrably. It is up to us to keep it from being in-
fri.nged more. It is worthy of note that all the anti-
gun bugs are men who know nothing about ﬁrearms
and their use and potentialities, and that the majority
of accidental killings are pulled off by men unfamiliar
with the proper use and workings of guns.

something is screwy.

Possible answers are three: (1)
that Pitt’s opponents are being led
up agblind allev; (2) that the team
doesn’t understand Carlson’s new
“Busy Bee” system; (3) that nobody
knows just how good this squad is.
Best answer is the third.

With visions of copping the l-F
all-point trophy for the second con-
secutive year, Phi Gamma Delta
ran roughshod over their oppo-
nents to win -both major fall
sports, touch football and speed-
ball. a '

Amassing a total of 3511/2 points,
the Fijis hold a commanding lead
over their closest rivals, Delta Tau
Delta. The Delts, while falling a
bit in the fall sports, have the four
winter sports remaining to make
up their 23'-point deﬁcit.

Phi Delts Third

Third place in the I-F standings
goes to the Phi Delta Theta squad
with 308% points. The Phi Delts
have legal claim to a third place in
speedball, and at the present time
are among the leaders in paddle
tennis and badminton.

This season’s I-F touch football
race lived up to all expectations for
the teams battled down to the final
day before the victors could be: de-
termined. The Fijis, given only a
slight chance to repeat their previ-
ous championship, surprised every-
one by putting a well‘ rounded high
scoring team on the ﬁeld.

The combination of Mitchell, Hol-
brook Bitner, MacNeil, and Mans-
ﬁeld proved too much for the op-
posing teams as they went on to an
undefeated campaign. As an added
honor they placed MacNeil and
Mitchell on the Pitt News all-intra-
mural ﬁrst team, and Bitner on the
second squad.

Phi Eps Get Cup

Phi Kappa’s Jack Glenn and com-
pany were stopped only by the
strong Phi Gam team, and ended
their season in the second slot. Dax
and Tyberski were valuable team-
mates to Glenn in his seemingly in-
dividual drive toward a title.

Phi Epsilon Pi got their long
awaited football cun, but they had
to be satisﬁed with third place
markings on it. Arnie Biron hit
the headlines by his sturdy line
play, and as a result was named to
the ﬁrst all-intramural team.

Phi Delta Theta. one of the
league’s pre-season, favorites, lost

under way it went like wildﬁre.
Phi Gamma Delta encountered no
dilﬁculty in their championship
drive until their ﬁnal game with
Pi Kappa Alpha.

This game was without a doubt
the most thrilling of the speedball
season for the ﬁnal goal was scored
by the Fijis with only ﬁve seconds
left to play. These ﬁve seconds gave
the Fijis the championship, and
shoved the Pi Kappa Alpha team
down to second place. The remain-
ing cup place went to Phi Delta
Theta.

designed. The single "set used in

A student of ﬁneiarts, Patrick
said the idea of a set that ‘would best
carry out the plot and facilitate
action came to him after he had
read the play. He hadrefused to
see pictures of the original sets de-
signed by the Guild theater for the
Broadway production, believing that
they might inﬂuence him.

The set is one huge mountain-

A udienfcef  Ja.schaiHeifet.2s

For Brahms

Concerto Rencl,itione , ;

' By Jean Garland

The widespread popularity attained by Jascha Heifetz accounted last
Friday evening for one of the largest and most enthusiastic audiences in
Syria Mosque this season.‘ Ably assisted by the Pittsburgh Symphony

orchestra. under the direction of Dr.
, Fritz Reiner, Heifetz, triumphedin
the playing of the Brahms'Conc’erto
in D major for violin andorchestra.
, An exquisite tone. and _faultless
technique, brought forth only by
such‘ superb violinists as Heifetz,
was revealed in the colorful Brahms
Concerto. From the cadenza, the
customary display passage of the
ﬁrst movement, to the gyfpsy-like
sophisticated form of the third
movement, Heifetz maintained —a
skill and virtuosity rarely heard.

For orchestra alone, the bverture
to the opera “The Magic Flute” sug-
gested all the light-hearted vigor
and merriment which Mozart uni-
quely fashioned. The great chords
of the brass in the slow introduc-
tion are of a Masonic symbolism.
Preserving the essential, clarity, so
vital to; the good" pje_rf.o'rmance of
Mozart’s music, the‘ orchestra gave
a very brilliant and glowing effect.

Contrasted. to the witching con-
certo and the sprightly overture,
Dr. Reiner chose the Sibelius Sec-
ond symphony in which the com-
poser casts his deep and austere
glance across the bare landscape
of his native land.

The folk-song inﬂuence and sub-
dued light of a Finnish country-
side is strangely felt in the second
movement. After the fast moving
third movement, Dr. Reiner force-
fully brought out the powerful mel-
ody of the main theme; the strings
down to and including the cellos
pronounced it with vigor. It is
curious that this music can be so
moving and mighty. yet be so cold.

Riﬂes Set December 13
For Little Military Ball

Members of Pitt Rifles will
dance to the music of Owen Pie-
per and his orchestra at the
Twentieth Century club from 9
to 1 o’clock on December 13, an-
nounces Ervin Peake, E43, social
chairman.

Only actives, candidates, and in-
actives of Pitt Riﬂes and the ad-
vanced corps of the ROTC are
permitted to attend the little Mili-
tary Ball. “This limitation is nec-
essary because of the large turn-
out expected and the limited
amount of space at the club,” said
Peake.

The reserve officers of the army,
navy. and marine corps are invited
to attend the affair.
