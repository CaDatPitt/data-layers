I It’s been 29 years since Pitt joined
the Big East Conference, but the Uni-

versity won’t remain a member for

much longer.
Pitt and Syracuse accepted invita-
tions to join the Atlantic Coast Con-

week, a news release from the ACC
said Sunday.

“This is an exciting day for the
University of Pittsburgh,” Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg said in the state-
ment released Sunday morning. “We
have a long history of competing and
collaborating with the distinguished
universities that already are members
of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and
[we] have enormous respect for both
their academic strengths and their
athletic accomplishments.” l

Productioniteam explains value of ‘Mister Rogers’

Rashi Goel
For The Pitt News

As Fred Rogers put on his cardigan and athletic

shoes on his set at Pitt’s campus, he dreamt of A

changing the world through television. And his
production team led that change in the world.

Pitt In Hollywood and Steeltown Entertain-
ment Project broughtthe visionaries of the Fred
Rogers Company to the William Pitt Union Ball-
room on Friday, giving more than 300 students
and Pittsburgh residents an insider’s look into
how Fred Rogers brought meaningful television
to a national children’s audience. The produc-
tion team discussed with about 3oo people how
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” connected to
Pitt during its 40-year run.

Pitt students and residents have emotional '
connections to this show about which Pitt In
Hollywood President Ryan O’Shea said the or-
ganization wanted to inform students. That’s
why Pitt In Hollywood, an organization formed

tainment industry and Pitt students and teach-
ers, brought the team here because the show
started on Pitt’s campus, at the original WQED
studios which were located at Pitt’s current

Music Building.

At the 3—hour—long event, the production
team behind the show —— which includes Bill
Isler, The Fred Rogers Company CEO and board
chair of Steeltown Entertainment Project; Mar-
garet Whitmer, producer of the show; Pittalum—

nus David Newell; Mr. McFeely, character on the I

show and its associate producer and director
of public relations, and Pitt alumnus Hedda
Sharapan, the show’s associate producer— was
present. The team members discussed the mak-
ing of “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” and had the
audience view clips from the show.

“There was a young manwho saw television
and dreamt that he could use that new medium
to help change the world for the better,” the
pamphlet handed out at the event said.

Breanna Durham
For The Pitt News

An inscription outside the Car-
negie Library of Pittsburgh’s Main
branch reads “Free to the People.”
But for the library staff, keeping the
place running is far from free.

The Carnegie Library released

its 2010 annual report this sum-

mer, stating that it costs a total
of $23,926,662 to run the library
system. Fifty-seven percent of that
amount goes to employees’ salaries
and beneﬁts.

Jordan Romanus, a volunteer
with Our Library, Our Future —— an
initiative organized by CLP to raise
awareness about the need to pro-
vide ﬁnancial support for Carnegie
Library — said that this year, the
library received just enough ﬁnan-
cial help to get by.

But now people invested in the
library are taking the ﬁnancial mat-
ter into their own hands. They ap-
proached City Council with a peti-
tion for a referendum on a library
tax, and are working on various ini-
tiatives to ensure Carnegie Library
continues operations.

“Things are looking grim,” he
said, referring to the library’s ﬁ-
nancial situation.

The situation got so out of hand
that Pittsburgh City Council and
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl stepped in
during 2010 and provided an emer-
gency fund to keep everything run-
ning smoothly.

“We are only able to do this
temporarily,” Councilman Patrick
Dowd, who serves on CLP’s Board
of Trustees, said. “The city has its
own issues. It’s not a permanent
solution.”

And internal solutions have like-
wise stopped providing answers to
the library’s plight, such as cuts at
the library.

Romanus said that the library
has cut services, hours and work-
ers to try and solve the ﬁscal prob-
lem. I

“The library has cut all it can,”
Suzanne Thinnes, communica-
tions manager at Carnegie Library,
said.

Thinnes said that since 2003,
200 weekly library hours have been

cut, along with 200 full-time and .

part-time positions.
In order to ﬁnd solutions to the

September 19, 2011 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittneWs.com

money problems, the library has
held open community workshops
to discuss plans that community
members have had for the library,

' The library
has cut all it
can. ‘ ‘
— Suzanne
Thinnes

-——--99-—-—-

as well as solutions that City Coun-
cil members have had to help the
library’s ﬁmding.

“One man said he was unem-

ployed, and if it weren’t for the li- '

brary, he wouldn’t have had access
to Internet or books,” Dowd said
about one community meeting that

 

3

he attended. “He wouldn’t have had
a hope of getting a job.”

Currently, the Public-Private
Task Force on Sustainable Funding
for Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
— a group of city ofﬁcials have set
out to explore sources of long-term
funding for Pittsburgh’s system of
neighborhood libraries. — They
have come up with six solutions for
ﬁnancing the library.

One is an initiative that asks
citizens to vote “yes” on the local
Nov. 8 ballot that will include a
referendum for a $250,000 spe-
cial tax on all taxable real estate in
Pittsburgh. That is $2.09 per month
on $100,000 of assessed value. If

passed, the referendum will go into A

effectjan. 1, 2012.

“The centerpiece is the voter ini-
tiative,” Dowd said. “It’s immediate.
If we are successful here, we can
say, ‘Look, this is important.’ The
tax dollars will come back many
times over.”

According to the Carnegie Li-
brary of Pittsburgh’s website, An-
drew Carnegie did not endow the
library system. He provided money
to build the original library, but did
not provide a fund for ongoing op-

cials push for new Carnegie Library funding

erations.

The library system has had to
continue to look for ways to build
an endowment to ensure that lack of
funding will be taken care of, should
it arise again in the future as tech-
nological updates continue to weigh
heavily on the system’s budget..

Thinnes said that online re-
sources, such as eBooks, can be
expensive. After so many uses,
the library eventually has to re-
purchase eBooks because, unlike
physical books, they are not a one-
time purchase. Certain publishing
companies require that purchased
eBooks be repurchased after it is
lent to readers so many times.

The library’s website lists some
of the programs and events that it
offers to communities. It has com-
puter training, language classes,
technology help, free Internet,
study rooms and a vast collection
of books.

“Carnegie Library is an extreme- l

ly valuable asset to the Pittsburgh
community,” Romanus said.
Dowd agreed. “It doesn’t matter
who you are, everybody is free to go
to the library. It’s the most demo-

.cratic institution,” he said. I

Rogers held jobs in many areas, from tele-

ultimately wished to ﬁnd a sponsor to fund a
children’s program.

Sharapan said that Rogers “encouraged chil-
dren to pretend and use their imaginations.”

The popular show’s creator felt that one had

to connect with audiences, and to do this, he
would “sit with children hour after hour at Pitt,
learning how to interact with them and ﬁguring
out what they liked,” Sharapan said.

Rogers’ wife,]oarme Rogers, said she never
feltthat her husband would start such an inﬂu-

Sharapan said that Fred Rogers’ inﬂuaence

Preparedness  
benchmark ﬂawed

When students falter during their
ﬁrst year of college, it’s often be-
cause of a conﬂuence of factors:
an unfamiliar environment or a
party—centric mentality. One non-
proﬁt, however, believes a single
score can help predict academic
success or failure.

This Wednesday, College Board
unveiled the College and Career
Readiness Benchmark, a tool that
associates academic preparedness
with SAT performance. Based on
research correlating a combined
math, critical reading and writing
score of 1550 with a 65 percent
likelihood of earning at least a
2.67 freshman year GPA — which
in turn foretells a better chance of
college “success and completion”
—— the test service deemed only
43 percent ofhigh school seniors
prepared to enroll.

Curiously, the College Board
stressed that this correlation be
used to evaluate the effectiveness
of academic programs, and not
the readiness of any particular
student. Regardless, although
we agree therigors of academic
life are often a shock to incoming
freshmen, we wonder whether
this is the best standard by which
to plan a high school curricu-
lum.

First and foremost, while the
test provider claims a 2.67 GPA
is crucial, it fails to elaborate on
the consequences of not achiev-
ing such a score. Furthermore,
despite the supposed predictive
power of GPAs, one’s performance
during freshman year is, in our
experiences, an unreliable indica-
tor of future achievement. Many
undergraduates, for whatever
reason, struggle during their ﬁrst

two semesters, but subsequently
compose themselves to graduate
with an exemplary record.

More importantly, there are

other ways besides a GPA to mea— ‘

sure academic success. One is the
quantity of awards or accolades
a student garners; another is the
quality of their research or schol-

arship, which can be conducted '

outside of a particular class and
thus wouldn’t affect grades.

For all the benchmark’s flaws,
however — in reality, it might be
impossible to determine what
“readiness” actually denotes, es-
pecially with regards to academ-
ics —— we concur with the Board’s

conclusion: Astartling number of ‘

freshmen are ill—prepared for a
strenuous course load. Whether
or not they’re the products of
pampered upbringings or ailing
schools, students, in our experi-
ence, have a tendency to botch
their ﬁrst classes.
Unfortunately, as a ‘recent
Pennsylvania Association of
School Administrators survey
aflirms, state and federal cuts to
public education will likely per-
petuate such ineptitude. Thirty-
ﬁve percent of the 294 districts
that responded to the survey said
they’d reduced or eliminated tu-
toring or other assistance pro-
grams as a consequence of budget

cuts; 20 percent had cut summer 9

school.
“Success” is a nebulous term,
and the College Board’s “bench—
mark” score is likely to provoke
widespread skepticism. Never-
theless, the problem of college
under—preparedness is very real
— even if we don’t agree with cer-
tain means of gauging it. I

Revive America’ s hat tradition

Presidents usedto sport dashing headwear, even if they hadn’t yet encountered the stylistic sensibilities

Prepare your wardrobes: It’s about
to get cold again.

When the weather ﬁnally turns
chilly, the usual fall clothingcomes
out: the hoodies, jeans and jackets
we haven’t used for months. But
sadly, I am one of the few people
who will reach for a seemingly
antiquated garment: a hat.

I am astonished that even
when the temperature falls into
the single digits, the percentage

of people wearing hats is relatively

small. And when a person does
decide to wear a hat, it is almost

invariably either a baseball hat or

a stocking cap, with the occasional _

old geezer or oddball like myself
sporting a fedora or beret. I don’t
have anything against baseball
hats or stocking caps ‘— I wear
both of them myself. But the seri-
ous lack of hat diversity is just a
little alarming. The baseball cap
in particular is limited to only a
certain subset of events and tem-
peratures. This is why we never
see the pope in a baseball cap with
a golden P on a white background,
as cool as it would be to have a
Vatican City cap.

For the most part, hats, like

old movies feature guys walking

actually dressed that way. Look at
a photo of any large crowd gath—.
ered to hear word of the sinking
of the Titanic or the stock market
crash of 1929 and you will see a
sea of hats. Presidents tradition-
ally wore stovepipe hats to their
inaugurations, the last one to do
so beingjohn F. Kennedy in 1961,
although he didn’t wear it during
the iconic inaugural address.

Hatsare invaluable for insulation, fashion sense

history, we can see that at one time
it was even acceptable to wear hats
inside. For example,_lines 92-93 of
Act V, Scene 2 of “Hamlet” read,
“Put your bonnet to his right use;
’tis for the head,” even though the
character that says this is in a cas-
tle hallway. Women today are still
allowed to wear hats in church,
and even now, the more solemn
and important the occasion —
such as graduation —— the funnier
the hats people wear. ' V

Why don’t more people‘ wear
hats daily? Although the catalyst
for this decline might not be na-
tional, some publications, includ-
ing Vice" and Primer magazine,
report that the blame often rests

on Kennedy, who generally didn’t -

wear one and allegedly forever as-
sociated youthfulness with being
bareheaded. Others blame cars for
the decline of the hat, as it is hard
to climb into and outiof a car while
wearing ‘one.

I’m not particularly convinced
by either of these arguments —— al-
thoughJFK might explain why our
parents don’t wear hats, it doesn’t
explain why we don’t. The car ex-
planation also leaves something

I to be desired: It’s not like the car

was inventedin 1960 or that all
cars built since then have been
really compact.

Probably the best explanation
is a paradoxical one. People don’t
wear hats because nobody wears
them, and this fact makes them

less attractive to wear. This goes
beyond the herd mentality or
some Oedipal desire to kill our

'hat—wearing old man, and back to

a simple practical consideration.
Because there is no demand for
them, very few places have hat
or coat racks — so you can either
hold yourhomburg in your lap or
crudely toss it in the middle of
the table at which you are sitting,
hoping that it doesn’t get crushed
wherever it ends up.
Contributing to the lack of hat

diversity is the lack of information

about headwear. You do n’t have to

settle for a hat that makes you look
like a trucker, rapper, shortstop or

that guy who says, “Are you ready
for some football!?” on Monday

night. You can look like a Brit-
ish banker, ’30s—style detective,
American colonist and more just
by ﬁnding a hat shop.

There are many reasons to
wear hats. First, they keep the
head warm. Although it’s a myth
that most body heat is lost through
the head, cold heads and ears are
still unpleasant.

This does not mean that wear-

ing a hat dooms one’s head to be-

coming a baked potato injuly. De-
pending on the style of hat, more
or less heat can be trapped. This
is why people wear straw boaters
on the Fourth of July and heavy
felt in the winter. Brimmed hats
also provide protection from the
sun and rain.

More importantly, hats are,

stylish. Turn on any period drama
where hats are worn and tell me
that the actors don’t look sharp.
Granted, some hats are ridiculous,
like the wide-brimmed women’s
ones that seem to feature an entire V
peacock or the heaviest and most’ ’
ungainly of Napoleonic shakos.
But by and large, even the funny
hats do look sort of cool.

So I challenge you to look into
getting yourself a hat that is some-
what beyond the mainstream.
You’ll look and feel much better
and be a part of something larger
than yourself: reviving the mori-
bund tradition of hat-wearing.

‘ Having been to Ireland, I can say
conclusively it’s not all that everyone
thinks it is. Sure, there’s drinking
and a beautiful countryside, but it’s

- also somewhat small and run down.

The country is ﬁlled with grungy in-
dustrial cities, and unemployment
is high. .-

This isn’t to say Ireland isn’t an '

appealing nation, but merely that it’s ,

not full of rainbows and shamrocks
like everyone imagines. Indeed, very
few people seem conscious of the fact

that the current state of Ireland is
~  butidealistic.

Unsurprisingly, many such people-
attended the Pittsburgh Irish Festival
from Sept.  13, the halfway

part I was underwhelmed with the
event, mostly due to its overpriced
tickets and disappointing drinks-.

their hair red or green. But as I was
looking around, I couldn’t help but
wonder how many people were ac-
tually Irish.

Now I’m not saying that you have
to be Irish to appreciate a cultural
festival. I myself enjoy the Greek
Food Festival, for example, right
here in Oakland. What I’m concerned
about are those who claim a heritage
that doesn’t belong to them.

Why aren’t these people more
caught -up in celebrating their own
nationalities? It’s not like I show up
to the Greek Food Festival wearing

the popularity and respect neces-

probably had something to do with
the Irish’s inﬂuential role in the go-
ings-on of American society begin-
ning in the 19th century. With high
populations in so many U.S. cities,
along with a prevalent Irish mob,
those who were Irish were proud
to be — and that’s something that
runs deep.

Today, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, the, Irish are the
second—largest self—reported ethnic
group in the United States (the ﬁrst
is Germans). So it makes sense that
many Americans can relate to their
“work hard, play hard” ancestors
from across the pond. I

other cultures to admire.

The ACC was established in 1953. Since then, the schools making up the
conference have won 120 National Championships, including 64‘ in ‘women’s 
competitions and 56 in men’s. In,2009—2010, the ACC captured a record 10 ‘

national titles: in men’s "soccer, rowing, women’s soccer, ﬁeld hockey, wo’men’s ,_
lacrosse, men’s lacrosse, men’s basketball and men’s ice hockey. Here is a '1 ‘ '

havepaidupto $11millionperteam.. Norden-
bergand PittAthletic Director Steve Pedersonhave
received criticismthathas assertedthatthey led
thecharge inpetsuadingthe membe-is ofthe Big
East not to accept the offer.

Nordenberg saidthatPitt acted alongwith the
rest of the teams in the conference, and did not
actively campaign against the deal.

“Any characterization that either Pitt, Steve
orlledachargeagainstconsummatingacontract
with ESPNis simply inaccurate,” Nordenbergsaid.
“In the end, when the conference did decide not
to accept the ESPN offer, it was an unanimous
vote of all 16 members thatwas not led by us or
by anyone else.”

0 Although the deal makes geographical and
ﬁnancial sense for both Pitt and Syracuse, some

members of the Big East community view this 7

decisionas abetraya1oftheBigEastbytwo of
the conferences oldest members. Syracuse was
afoundingmember andPi1tjoinedin1982,three
years after the conference formed.

Marina1tosaidinastatementthathewas“ve1y
disappointed” bythe news.

Pederson defended the move. “}3\reryonehad
the same approach, whichis [that] youwantwhat’s
bestforyour institution,” he said. “We’re goingto
wony aboutus,we’regoingtowonyaboutmaki_ng
Pitt greatinevery areaofwhatwe’re doing.”

ACC Commissionerjohn Swolford said Sunday
morningthatconversations about expansionbe-
ganon'1hesday, andthatPittandSyracuse applied
for membership late in the week.

“Bythe end ofthedayon Fridaywe had submit-
ted a letter expressing interest in membership,”
Nordenberg said in a press conference Sunday.
“That’s about the most expeditious, compressed
decision makingprocessthatI’ve everbeenapart
of -— butlthinkthat did reﬂecttheview onboth
sides that this was avery good ﬁt.”

Severalnewsoutletsbeganreportingsamrday
that both schools applied for membership to the
ACC, and the rumors were conﬁrmed Sunday
morning when Pitt, Syracuse and the ACC all re-
leased statements sayingthe two teamswould be
joining the conference.

Other concerns for Pittfans include potentially

— losing the opporumity to play teams like West

Virginia and losing scheduled out-of—conference
series like the Penn State football series set for
2016. l

“It’s not goingto affect the Penn State series,
I can tell you that,” Pederson said, with a laugh.

‘ breakdown of the ACC’s bigger storylines since the year 2000.

“We’ve had a great history and series with West
Virginia dating back before the Big East Confer-
ence, andwe’re hopefulthat can continue.”

I The additions ofPitt and Syracuse— expand-
ing the ACC to a 14—team conference — make
geographical sense, Swofford said. He added that
no decisionhasbeenmade on the composition of
the new conference divisions. A

“Pittsburgh and Syracuse serve to enhance
the ACC’s reach into the states of New York and
Pennsylvania and geographicallybridges ourfoot-
print between Maiyland and Massachusetts,” he
said in astatement. “With the addition ofPitt and

Syracuse, the ACC will cover virtually the entire 0

Eastern Seaboard of the United States.”

Nordenberg added thatthe geography of the
conference is important to Pitt also, as the Uni-
versity tends tofocus on recruiting students from
the East_Coast. -

While Pittbegins it’s-transition, other schools l

willundoubtedlybegintoplantheirfut11reaswell.'
ESPN has already reported that the University
of Connecticut, another Big East school, has ex-
pressed interestinheadingto the ACC. Swofford
didn’t reﬁite the possibility of the ACC adding
two more teamsinthe nearﬁitnreto make ita
16-team conference. - S V
“Wearevery comfortablewiththis 14,butwe
are nqt,phj1osophicaﬂy,opposedto 16,” he said.

  
in the Associated Press Top 25 .for football, the

conference boasts one of the most impressive
basketball lineups in the country, with Duke and
North Carolina consistently  their
statuses as two ofthe top teams inthe country.
Swoffordalso said thatthe ACC wouldbe open

“As we looked at the ACC, we’re very similar
inso manyareas and our sport offerings areveiy
similar, solthinkwe come invery complementary
to what they’re already doing,” Pederson said.
“Sometimes opporumities present themselves

Todd Graham’s system irnploded in the fourth
, quarter, asthePittfootballteamleta21—point1ead
slip away in its ﬁrst road game of the season.
, ‘The Iowa Hawkeyes, who trailed for three
quarters, outscored Pitt 21-3 in the fourth and
took the lead on ajames Vandenberg pass to
wide receiver Kevonte Martin-Manley in the end

' zone. With a final score of 31-27 came Pitt’s ﬁrst

' loss of the season.
Pitt regained the ball with 2:51 remaining in
j the game, but Iowa rightcomerbackMicahHyde

’ intercepted quarterback Tino Sunseri, allowing

‘ the Hawkeyes to run out the clock and seal the
victory at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City.

V “We’re disappointe ,” Pitt senior defensive
tackle Chas  said. “To feel like you’re beat-

P ingthemupforliterallythewhole game, andthen
~ it’sjustanighl:mare.” A
ThePantherslookedimpressiveearly,pulling V

out to a 24-3 lead in the third quarter.

“There was great rhythm, guys ' getting after
it, itwas exciting to watch,” Pitt head coach Todd
Graham said. “It was the best by far that we’ve
played, and it was just really disheartening.”

But once Pitt reached that point, the team
began to unravel. Suddenly, a defense that kept
the Iowa offense at bay for most of the game
couldn’t stop the passing attack.

A Pitt offense that ﬁnally looked smooth and,
as Graham said, “like we want itto look,” couldn’t
move down the ﬁeld and turned the ball over.
The result was Pitt being outscored 21-3 in the

fourth quarter, a quarter where Iowa had four ~

possessions and three touchdowns. The only pos-
session the Hawkeyes didn’t score atouchdown
on was the ﬁnal possession of the game, when
they intentionally ran the clock out. ’ _

The pinnacle of their fourth quarter success
came when Vandenberg found Martin-Manley
in the end zone to cut the Pitt lead to 27-24.
The momentum completely shifted, and the
Hawkeyes rode that touchdown straight to the
game—winner.

The Panthers didn’t lose their aggressiveness,
Alecxih said, but they didn’t playas smart asthey
had all game.

Alecxih pointed to unsatisfactory senior
leadership as one of the major reasons for Pitt’s
struggles so farthis season. Against Buffalo and

Maine, the Panthers also let their opponents

score late in the game.

“It’s on me. It’s on the rest of the seniors,” he '

said. “The senior leadership was horrendous.
Theyhave the ball andwe’re up by 10, wejusthave

g to say that they’re not moving the ball.”

Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz said he doesn’t
know what ignited the Hawkeyes’ comeback, but
he didtell the players thatmany oftheir struggles
were self—inﬂicted. *

“Wewanted to throwtheballalittle bittoday,

“Really found our rhythm inthe last20 minutes.
That was good to see.”

Even with the late collapse, Graham said he
was conﬁdent that Pitt would be able to score
at the end of the fourth quarter and take home
the victory. . « V

“I thought we were going to march it right
down and score at the end of the game, because
they really couldn’t stop our offense and what
we’re doing,” Graham said.

He added that Iowa’s inability to runthe foot-
ball made him feel secure throughout the game
that Pitt would win 4 until Pitt’s pass coverage
started to fall apart.

“I thoughtwe did a greatjob tackling; Ithought
we did a great job with the plan we had,” he said.
“I thoughtwe did well even inthe passing game,
thenallof the suddenwe started backing up, loos-
ening up, not executing the coverage, letting guys
run down the seam with no one on them.”

Graham said Sunseri looked the best he’s
looked all season for portions of the game, but
the quarterback also made several mistakes‘, in-
cluding two interceptions and a dropped snap.
His second interception late in the fourth quarter
allbut wrapped up the Iowavictory. -

Sunseri ﬁnished with 255 yards, two touch-
downs and two interceptions on 23-33 passing.

“I thought he played better,” Graham said.
“Butyou can’tturnthe ball over. Poorball security
cost us a »lot_ of time in this game.”

Sunseri said nobody on the team relaxed with
the big lead, but added that the Panthers didn’t

play as well in the fourth quarter: _ ,

“For three and a half quarters, we felt 
we were doing everything right,” Sunseri said.
“But you can’t play three and ahalf quarters and
expect to win a game against a good Iowa team.
We just have to go in, ﬁnish off games and do
everything we can as an offense to put points
on the board.” .

Wide receiver Devin Street, who collected 
yards and one touchdown on seven receptions,
said the Panthers won’t “hang their heads.”

“We see what we can do, what our potential
is,” Street said. “We just have to go out and ex-
ecute. Ithinkwe gota little too comfortable with
that 24-3 lead.”

What Pitt needs to ﬁnd, Street added, is con-

’ _ sistency. Aiter dorninatingfor much of the game,

the Panthers seemed to fall apart completely
in the fourth quarter, unable to complete the

- plays that originally built the large lead. Two

costly penalties for a total of 17 yards hurt Pitg
cause in the fourth quarter, especially since the‘
Panthers were able to avoid penalties for much
of the game.

The Hawkeyes pulled to within three points
with 6:19 left in the fourth quarter when Van-
denberg found Martin-Manley for a 25-yard
touchdown. After the extra point, Pitt led 27-24.
The Panthers punted on their next possession,
setting up Iowa’s game—winning drive.
