a more elaborate rushing this fall
than last year in accordance with the;
new rules issued by Panhellenic Coun-}

For the past three years no official;
rushing preceded the fall bid day.,'
Prior to this time the fall rushing;
was an expensive three-day affair. Re-l
turns to the fraternities did not jus-A:
tify the expense and thus the bid day;
system was adopted. |

This year Panhellenic Council has;
n1odiﬁed- the bid day system to in—§
elude one rushing affair. The affair.’
is to be an informal one and is tol
take place next Sunday from 3 to 51,
o’clock.

Mary Garber, Col. ’33, president ofl
Panhellenic, expects that the new!
system will increase the efficiency of.
fall rushing in that the one affair!
will give the girls a chance to become;
better acquainted. I

Last Thursday at the S-oldier’s Me-l
morial Hall eligible freshmen at-
tended the freshman education meet-
ing. Frances Abes, Ed. ’33, Panhel-
lenic chairman of freshman educa-
tion, instructed the girls in regard to-
the proper etiquette in answering in-
vitations and ﬁlling in ballots.

The invitations which were sent
yesterday to each rushee are to be
answered by Friday, November 11.
Fraternities are to turn in their bid-

At Marcrfhon Round Table,

Drive Starts Tomorrow

 

If Pitt students are judges there is
going to be a" family of Panthers, in-
stead of the one now being termeo

“moth eaten” by sports writers over
the country.

Resenting the aspersions cast at the
Pitt mascot in the recent game
against Army, and more recent, the
game at Philadelphia Saturday against
Pennsylvania, the published reports
have drawn the ire of students in all
classes and all activities.

Arthur Goldberg, Col. ’33, chairman
of the traditions committee of Stu-
dent Council, and chairman of the
student drive to raise funds for the
purchase of a new suit for the
Panther, said yesterday. “We have
had no knowledge until this time just
how popular the Pitt Panther is with
students and outsiders attending foot-
ball games at the Stadium and out of
town. He is in demand, and no game
seems to be complete without his
presence on the ﬁeld, We certainly
are going to try in this drive to make
his appearance at future games as!
sured and in good condition.”

Symposium Speakers Attack, Defend
11 Forum Discussions

Debaters from Princeton,
Virginia, and Pitt Give
Political Arguments

 

By Edwin Banks

At least one group of Allegheny
County voters should go to the polls'
today, knowing exactly what candi-
date to vote for land why. That
group was presentvfat the intercollegi-
ate political symposium, non-partisan
discussion of the programs and per-
sonalities of the major‘ parties, at
Schenley High school Friday night.

Republicans, Democrats, Socialists,
and Communists all had their say at!
the meeting, and s'upporters of each
party attacked and defended vigor-
ously. On the platform the Hoover-
ites and Rooseveltians devoted most
of their speeches to ripping to pieces
the record and program of each oth-
ers’ candidate, the Socialists present-
ed their program and denounced thatl
of the Communists, while the latter’s’
backers in the audience, monopoliz-

ing the open forum period, ﬂayed
Thomas and his followers and the‘
present system in general.

Speaking ﬁrst, John P. Bracken,|
Pitt Democrat, in ,true Jeffersoniau’

fashion, 1:-itingly {lashed President
Hoover and his “American system.”
This “system,” Bracken declared,

“was responsible f"pr depression, un-
employment, and gconcentration of
wealth into the hands of a few.” De-
riding the Republigcan lead-er’s pro-
gram of equal op ortunity, Bracken
asked, “What equality of opportunity
have twelve million men out of
work?” In conclusion, he urged the
support of the audience for Mr.
Roosevelt and his “new deal for the:
forgotten man.”
Defends Socialism

J. A. Cobey, Princeton Socialist,
gave his address next. After refuting
some of the arguments of the ﬁrst
speaker, he explained why he was a
Socialist. “The only way to escape
the
to have a peaceful, ‘blood-less change
Socialism
alone can bring this about," he as-
serted, and later declared that “So-
cialism is the only defense against
unemployment.” Cobey presented
the Socialist program, advocating re-
adjustment of the tax: system with
higher income and inheritance taxes,
government ownership of natural
monopolies, cancellation of war
debts, and'a national economic coun-
oil.

A Republican, although he came
from Jefferson’s native state, Edward
C. McClintock, Jr., Virginia, lauded
the Hoover administration and at-
tacked the policies of each Demo-
cratic president from Jackson to Wil-
son. “Republican administration,” he
insisted, “has always been steady and
uniﬁed in action, while the Demo-
crats have had constant dissension
within their ranks.” Stating that
Roosevelt was no leader, McClintock
denounced the New York Governor’s
stand on foreign debts, the tariff, and
agriculture. “Franklin Roosevelt,” he
concluded, “would rather be Presi-
dent than be right.”

Genevieve Blatt Speaks

Genevieve Blatt, the only coed
speaker on the platform, was the sec-
ond student to back Norman Thomas
and his program. Miss Blatt declared
that the present d-epre-ssion was the‘
inevitable result of the capitalist sys-
tem. “We have been taking over in-
dustries and institutions affected with
public interest, throughout the his-
tory of the nation,” she argued, “such
as post offices, roads. schools, etc.,con-
sequently it is not alien to our national
policy to have government owner-
ship of public utilities as the Social-
ists advocate.” She urged the adop-
of constitutional amendments
restricting the powers of the Supreme
Court and allowing proportional rep-
resentation.

The next Democrat to speak, Wil-
liam S. Mund-y, Jr., Virginia, reiter-
ated throughout his address that
what the American people need is a
“revision to the sound principles of

\

J. A. Cobey, Princeton, Socialist:
“Thomas will not be elected, yet I
feel that he will poll several million
votes. The reason is that the think-
ing people of our nation are dissatis-
ﬁed with both of the major parties—
platforms and candidates. Herbert
Hoover offers to continue his present
disastrous policies, while Franklin D.
Roosevelt preaches nothing but
‘change for changes sake.’

“My appeal as a student
’to fellow students is that they accept
their obligation to the nation in ex-

J r.,

ercising an intelligent inﬂuence in
public affairs. As a Democrat I em-
phasize this obligation, for the Dem-
ocratic claim is based upon greater
truths, greater principles of govern-
ment beyond the comprehension of
the unthinking public, not as the Re-
publican claim is based, upon obvious
and expedient, but misleading solu-
tions in speciﬁc cases without con-
sideration of ultimate results.”

on prohibition and declared that a
low tariff and reciprocal trade agree-

prosperity to America a.nd the world-.

Cites Student Preference

Last of the scheduled speakers, J.
H. Sheiﬂy, Princeton Republican,
cited the support of college students
throughout the nation for Mr. Hoover.
Sheiﬂy attacked the principles of the
[Socialist party, stating that Socialist
government would foster all the evils
of bureaucracy. Most of the Roose-
veltians, he said, would ‘be voting
with “cotton in. their ears,’’- merely
protesting without considering seri-
ously the campaign issues. He crit-
icized the Democratic candidate’s
“straddle” on the bonus question and
rebuke of the ‘Supreme Court. and de-
nounced noted backers of Roosevelt
such as William Randolph Hearst,
whom the speaker cha.racterized- as
the “disgrace to American journal-
ism.”

“The members sprang into for-

Cap And Gown
Gets 15 Skits

Marlatt Receives Student
Manuscripts, Songs

 

 

P1‘0SDects for an ent.irely student-
written Cap and Gown show were
strengthened yesterday by the an-
nouncement that ﬁfteen skits and
songs had been submitted to Director
William Marlatt during his stay here
last week.

Both Director Marlatt and Walter
J. Rome, assistant dean of men, were
enthusiastic over the response of
students to the call for student ma-
terial. This year's production, a re-
vue rather than a musical comedy, af-
fords greater opportunity for the tal-
ented undergraduate author and com-
poser, Director Marlatt pointed out.

Further contributions for the 1933
production, both skits and music,
must be in the hands of “falter
Rome before December 16, who will
forward all student-written material
to Director Marlatt in New York.
, Marlatt, upon his return to Pittsburgh
Ion January 15, will go over the ma-
'terial for the show with the authors
and composers and work out the de-
tails of production.

them,” was the Public Ledger’s

§:Pitt Pushes Pennsylvania

E
ibelligerent Panthers Saturday at

the country, 19-12.
In a game that was Pitt’s in

game proved to be one of the most
exciting on Franklin Field for many
a season.

No upsets marked the appearance
of the Panthers in Philadelphia over
the week-end, but it did mark the su-
periority of Jock Sutherland as a
‘coach over his former classmates and

pupils. Harvey Harman and Alex

A course, laid out Friday by track Fox had pointed the Quakers well in

coach, Carl Olsen, will bring every
part of the campus into view for the
runners and some parts not ordin-
arily seen by most in their regular
daily trips to and from classes.

All entered in the run may rest as-
sured that they will not get off the
course. Every known and little
known turn, change of direction. and
curve or cut-off will be ﬂagged for
identiﬁcation.

Start in Stadium

Starters will begin their trek over
the campus a.t noon, Saturday a week,
in the Stadium at the 440-yard start-
er mark. Circling the Stadium to the
dressing room gate, the boys will
make their exit through the gate and
hit the -trail across the stadium drive,
over the hill to the corner of Morgan
and Aliquippa streets, turning right
at the intersection of these two
streets, and following Aliquippa. to
just beyond the oil and gas building.

A left turn here brings the boys
around the tennis courts to the min-
erology building, where the upper
University drive is crossed, and the
boys run along the front of the mines
buildings to the practice ﬁeld, where
an open gate invites them through.

The course takes the runners
through the practice ﬁeld to another
gate at its upper end, and circling
the outside of the practice ﬁeld, com-
ing out by the University Printer’s

office to the upper drive, barriers“

Cheering and Suspense

It was another game as that against
Notre Dame, with the teams bringing
the stands into an alternation of wild
cheering and nervous suspense.

Held scoreless in the ﬁrst quarter.
after getting to their opponents 10-
yard line, the Panthers charged the
Penn line in the early moments of
the second quarter, and 011 a 62-yard
ma.rch Heller lugged the ball across
Penn’s goal line for the ﬁrst touch-
down.

Instead of quelling the combative
spirit of the Quakers, this touchdown
marked a savage attempt on the part
of the home boys to tie the score.
Hogan’s kick was partially blocked
and Skladany retrieved the punt on
his own 10-yard line. Kellet’s pass

Jock sent in his substitute back-
ﬁeld and in the third quarter the ball
surged back and forth in midfield.
‘until VVeisenl:-augh upset the regular
order of things, intercepting Mung-
er’s pass. His 47-yard dash placed
the ball on the Penn 15-yard stripe;
four plays later Pitt had its second
touchdown.

More difficulty attended Pitt's last
touchdown in the last quarter. After

the Penn boys, sensing a touchdown,
lost steadiness and fumbled on Pitt’s

Penn ’s Crusading Quakers failed to cope successfully with the

Franklin Field before 70,000 wit-

nesses, to lose their undefeated standing among football teams in

the matter of rushing but no one

lFrom this point the Panthers func-

;march to the Penn goal, Heller and
isebastian getting off 25, 20. and 20-
yard gains, with Mike lugging the ball
across on the eighth play.
_K-ellett Dashes 57 Yards

Kellett put the stands in a frenzy
of excitement with his 57-yard dash,
‘reluding every Pitt tackler for Penn’s
second touchdown, shortly after, when
he received Hogan’s punt.

Penn’s last try to tie the score
came with two minutes to play
when Kellett’s 50-yard punt touched
Hogan’s leg on his own 15-yard line.
As the clock ticked out its precious
seconds. Kellett tossed his ﬁnal pass
of the afternoon from Pitt's 15-yard
line, the ball going over the end
zone.

The game ended after three plays.

And in the words of Harvey "Har-
,man, following the game, “Gosh, what

Gllicers’ Night

R] ORE tll-(3.11 a lmndred stlulonts. leaders in undorgraduatc activi-
ties, were the guests of tlie Ilnivl‘-1-sity last Thursday evening at
tl1e annual Officers’ Night banquet.

For many of them, the writer included, Officers’ Night. was a. new
experience-—-one that will not be fo1'g'ottc11 for some time to come.
Something was created at that meeting bv the mere presence of peo-
ple who share a common interest and come together once each year
for new inspiration and understanding. This consciousness of a
common purpose and fellowship, felt by all but seldom if ever ex-
pressed at any other time by the majority, was given expression
Thursday night by the Chancellor and the University’s two most
outstanding students.

Few students ever speak before others as did Rose Marie
Demestichas, president of WSG-A, and Reed P. Rose, president of
Student Council. Certainly, we believe, no Pitt activities leader,
man or woman, ever before presented the attitude of the under-
graduate with as much conviction and sincerity as Miss Demestichas.
Her talk was supplemented by a similarly intensiﬁed appeal for
leadership from President Rose.

Such moments of complete understanding come but once or
twice. in the span of all undergraduate career. It is regrettable that
the spirit‘o:‘f Oﬂicers’ Night cannot be carried, unchanged, to every

PEC'l‘A’l‘OR-S at the Pitt-Penn game were as much impressed by
the showing of the Pitt band on Franklin Field as they were by
the vigor and drive of the eleven members of the Panther football
team.

Philadelphia. newspapers had a word of praise for the ROTC
(lrillcd representatives of the University. One account of the game
and the attendant demonstration hailed the Pitt band as “the great-
est musical organization to take this ﬁeld since the famed Illinois
band came with Red Grange.”

Another account, describing the joint arrival of the Penn tcain
and the Pitt band, says, “It was hard to tell wl1icl1 got the biggest
share of the cheers that greeted their appearance.”

Every follower of the Pitt team who witnessed Saturday ’s game
can testify that the above statements are far from being exaggera-
tions of what actually took place. -

Modestly, the Military Department credits the sensational de-
velopment of the band in the past two seasons to the spirit of the
individual members. But it must be noted that the present “esprit
do corps” and degree of proﬁciency in ﬁeld drill came only after the
band became an active unit of the ROTC under Colonel E. J. Cullen.

was a decisive victor over
Roosevelt, while Norm-an Thomas,
the Socialist, making surprising

gains, ran a. good third. From a lotall
of 58,686 votes cast, Hoover amassed:
29,289 votes, Roosevelt received 18,-!
 and Thomas polled 10,470. VVil-i
liain Z. Foster, the Communist candi-g
date, gathered 715 votes, while W’il-l
113.:-.1 I). Upshaw, the Prohibition partyi
standard bearer had some scatteringl
support and got 103 votes. 
Forty-seven Colleges Take Part

Forty-seven colleges in thirty—cne
states cooperated in the poll. The
electoral vote of these states is 401
out of the 531 seats in the electoral
college. In 1928 the fortv-seven col-
leges had a total number of students
of 275,680. Since then, of course, the
number has increased a. little. In
1928 all the colleges in the country
possessed a total number of students
of 695,219. Thus, the colleges in the‘
poll had about two—ﬁfths of all the
students in‘ the country while the poll
reached about one-fi fth of the students '
of the cooperating colleges.

Probably the most striking result.’
of the poll was the great gains of
Thomas. The Socialist candidate led
the voting in ﬁve colleges and almost
equalled Roose-.velt’s totals in the
East and the Middle. West.

As a. matter of fact, the strength
of Thomas in the colleges is probably
greater than even the votes display.
One of the poll’s most glaring weak-
nesses is failure to reach the larger,
metropolitan universities as thor-
cughly as it did the smaller, more ex-1
elusive, and usually more conserva-i

Poll Thorough in Small Schools

In eight very large universities
where Thomas received a good deal
better than a fourth of the votesl
cast, the poll reached not even a
tenth of the students. On the other
hand, in fourteen small schools,
where Thomas received about a sixth
of the votes, the poll reached much
more than a third of the students.
Thus, the poll was not nearly as fairl
as it might have been to the Social-l
ists.

In the same manner and for the
same reason, the poll was not exact-
ly just to Roosevelt. He, as Thomas,
received proportionately a larger
number of votes from the larger un-
iversities which were not thoroughly!
covered than he did from the small!
schools which were well covered.
However, this fault of the poll did not
hamper Roosevelt nearly as greatly
as it did-Thomas.

Another outstanding feature of the‘;
poll, besides the strength of the So-i
cialists, was the sectionalism dis-,3
played. Upholders of university edu-;’

took away from Roosevelt. But
Hoover had more votes than Roose-
velt and Thomas combined. It is
doubtful if this would have been so,
if the poll had been more thorough
in the large universities.

lother past polls with which to make
lcomparisons and because of the
lpolls own deﬁciencies this tendelicy

Republicans.

pleasant result, as the Republicans
have in these years since 1919, it is
dc-wnriglit cl-isagreeable to l1-ave to
sit waitiiig for a. defeat that even
your partisans admit.

In the last three national elections,

the G. O. P. has basked in the Nove.m—-

ber sunliglit of success foretold by na-
tion-wide straw votes. They have

wbeen able to point to the results of

the Literary Digest poll as an indie-
ator of the real news that would break
the morning after election day. Those
were happy years for the Republi-
cans. But 1932 is a dilt'erent story.
Digest Favors Roosevelt

This year the Literary Digest does
not admit Hoover a China.ma,n’s
chance of being elected. Of the 531
electoral votes, their poll grants the
Republican candidate 57. That would
be as complete a defeat as Hoover
dealt Smith in 1928 when Al came out
on the short end with 87 votes, Now,
while the Digest vote is a fairly sure
indication that Mrs. Roosevelt may
be able to move her furniture into the
White House in March, it is liardly
likely that the Republicans will go
down to so great a defeat as is pre-
dicted.

There are several doubtful states
which will probably slip into the H00-
ver column today. New York is not-
ably among these. Only -once (in
1912) has New York been carried by
a Democratic presidential nominee in
the past six elections. And on that
single occasion, the Republican forces
were divided between Roosevelt and
Taft.

Pennsylvania Doubtful

As for Pennsylvania, which this
year is indicated as Democratic in the
Digest poll, and as Repul:-lican in the
Hearst poll, the general agreenient
among the “experts” is that Hoover’s
chances depend upon the strength
that the Vare organization can muster
in and about Philadelphia. Michigan,
Kansas, Ohio, Delaware, and VVyom-
ing are among the other territories
considered doubtful. A last-minute,
conservative swing toward Hoover in

any or all of them is not beyond the

possible.

A prediction on the outcome of to-
day’s balloting ought to be interesting
if for nothing else than to prove how

cations have, in the past, frequently; poor a source of information this col-
referred to the broadening viewpointl1I.‘mI1 is. MY guess is that in addition
it gives. The poll is a sharp refuta-l to the seven fairly sure states (Cou-

j ‘.Vitl'1 the present campaign over,
;there oiiglit to be some interesting
‘revelations of the new methods, it
iany, which were used in the election-
eerlng. With partisan feeling dying
down in a hurry, as it certainly will,
there ought to be some honest ad-
missions from both sides of the
greatest boners pulled. For there
were plenty of them.

Nominations For l

My own choice for the worst speak-
er is Cha.rles Francis Coe, ex-pugilist
and writer of gangster stories for the
Saturday Evening Post, who pleaded
for Mr. Hoover. If there were any
similar orators on the air for the
Democrats, I certainly reg,'ret having
Inissed them.

As for the most unwisely conducted
campaign, I award the prize. without
equivocation to M1‘. Norman Thomas
and his boys. Some member of the

the Socialist aside and tell them a
few things about politics.
