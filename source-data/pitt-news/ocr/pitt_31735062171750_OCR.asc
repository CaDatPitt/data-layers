Testimony Conflicts
On Courtroom Melee

by MIKE SIMON

Contradicting testimony is be-
coming customary in the Pitts-
burgh Five Trials which has been
in progress since Feb. 8, in Fed-
eral Court.

Marc Cohen, testifying on be-
half of the Five stated, “I saw the
bailiff, Charles Satchko, yank Cap-
py Ascheim’s (one of ‘the Five)
hair. I got up to protest, moved my
left foot forward and then was hit
from both sides by police.”

Cohen went on to state, “Once
in the anteroom the lights went
out and I was grabbed by a uni-
formed police officer and thrown
into a wall and knocked down.”

Acting Homicide Inspector
Ralph Pampena, contradicting
Cohen stated, “I saw a youth,
later indentified as Marc Cohen,
run up to Satchko and give him a
roundhouse punch into the back
of his neck.”

The testimony of the Five was
concluded on Tuesday and was fol-
lowed by witnesses brought to
court by Fred Boehm, the assis-

tant city solicitor representing
District Attorney Robert Dugan
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)
President Francis Quinlan and
former Superintendent of Police
Stephen Joyce.

Robert L. Ruck, another mem-
ber of the Five stated, “I was
grabbed around the legs, arms
and hair by at least four police. I
was struck repeatedly while being
carried and after shouting ‘up
against the wall, up against the
wall,’ the officers smashed my
head into the wall twice.”

A much different testimony was
given by Detective Ronald Free-
man who told the court, “Ruck
made some references to my be-
ing a pig. and then he pushed and
kicked another officer.” Free-
man said he then struck Ruck.
Continuing, the detective denied
that Ruck was beaten’ as he was
carried to a jail cell; “he was just
being restrained, as he was kick-
ing and shouting.”

G0rmley,Wishner
To Head New

Bill Gormley has been named to
succeed Don Marbury as editor of
the Pitt News.

The Student Publications Exe-
cutive Board, which was respon-
sible for choosing the editor from
among three candidates, also
named Mark Wishner to succeed
Robert Lederman as Pitt News
business manager. Both appoint-
ments were announced Wednes-
day. ‘

The nomination procedure was
somewhat different than in past
years, in that the Pitt News staff
was given four votes on the 12-
man Executive Board. Those four
votes were determined by a staff
election, with the winner receiv-
ing all four votes.

The other voters on the Execu-
tive Board were the current edi-
tor, associate editor, and business
manager of the Pitt News, a rep-
resentative of Pi Delta Epsilon,
national journalism fraternity,

GORMLEY

and four representatives of the
student body chosen by the com-
missioners of the Student Asso-
ciation. Mrs. Esther Kitzes, di-
rector of Student Publications,
served as chairman of the Execu-
tive Board.

Gormley, junior from Edge-
wood, has been feature editor of
the Pitt News and is currently co-
news editor. He was opposed by
fellow news editor Bob Ging and
staff writer Pat O‘Brien.

Wishner, junior from Fords,
N. J., is presently the associate
business manager of the Pitt
News. He was opposed by Robin
Lunn, local advertising manager

Chancellor Returns from Africa Tour

Posvar Recounts Trip

by CAROLE COVAL

University of Pittsburgh Chan-
cellor Wesley A. Posvar describ-
ed his recent African trip as a
“hectic 20 days” today as be dis-
cussed current University issues
in an interview with WPGH and
Pitt News.

Chancellor Posvar said the pur-
pose of his visit was to “strength-
en faculty ties with African uni-
versities.”

Among the African locations he
visited was Yaounde, Cameroon,
where he inspected a diplomatic
training program sponsored by
the Carnegie Endowment for In-
ternational Peace. Posvar is a
trustee of this endownment. ‘

While he was in Yaounde, he
conferred with officials concern-
ing a program which will organize
paramedical training and new
health care activities in Came-
roon and two other African repub-
lics. The health project was ini-
tiated by Dr. Raymond Primas of

the University Center for Inter-
national Study here at Pitt.

Chance1lor,Posvar said that the
University of Pittsburgh is known
world wide. “We have faculty or
student exchanges in 40 coun-

Meter Artists
  Spray, Not Pay

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

A loosely organized group of
commuters, tired of what they
consider unjust parking fines and

rates, have struck out against the '
. city of Pittsburgh.

Calling themselves Students
Tired of Paying (STOP), the com-
muters last week painted over the
domes of more than 1,400 parking
meters in Oakland, Squirrel Hill,
and East Liberty.

One of the meter artists, who
used the pseudongm “Scott,”
told the Pitt News that commu-
ters had  . . paid enough. Let

the city start paying,” he said. , 

“Our motto is ‘Spray, Don’t Pay.”

“Scott” said that he and three
friends first thoughtof painting
meters some time ago as a way of
demonstrating the complaints of
commuters and also to prohibit
meter maids from ticketing cars.
Since then, the idea has caught on.

“It was a follow-the-leader sort
of thing,” said “Scott.” “It start-
ed out with the four of us and now
it’s developed into a sort of loose-
ly organized underground.”

Among “Scott’s" beefs against
the city is the inflexibility of me-
ter maids.

“Why should you have to pay a
$2 ticket when you're only a min-
ute or a half-minute late,” he ask-
ed. He also suggested that all me-
ters should allow at least four-
hour parking, rather than time
for just one or two hours parking.

According to “Scott,” the paint-
ings occurred last Wednesday and
Thursday, during the day at first.
But when it became obvious that
the unexpectedly largenumber of
people involved could have threat-
ened security, operations were de-
layed until night. Originally, each
commuter was to have spray-

 

paintéd the meter for his own
space and the two _or three meters
on either side in orderly tints of
red, white and blue.

In the morning, however, me-
ters daubed with all colors of the
spectrum indicated that much in-
discriminate painting had taken
place.

“We have a lot of good ideas,”
said “Scott,” who hinted that the
meter-painting episode might be
the first battle in an undeclared
war against thescity. “Scott” also
scorned more conventional com-
muter efforts, such as those of the
Commuter Association (CA).

“What does the CA ever get
done?” he asked. “The building of
those bus shelters was the first
thing they ever achieved. We’ve
found a way to bypass the CA.”

(Tom Gainan, president of the
CA, disavowed any connection be-
tween the meter painters and his
group. “As far as I know,” said
Gainan, “nobody in the CA is in-
volved.”)

tries,” he said, “including the
Middle East, Lebanon, Hong Kong,
Equador, and Malasia. We have

over 800 foreign students attend-- a

ing Pitt. I believe internationality
enriches the quality of education.”

“Last term,” he said, “many ‘

more students enrolled in courses
dealing with international rela-
tions. Students are taking advan-
tage of the exchange programs,
the Study Abroad program in Rou-
en, for example.”

Chancellor Posvar said that 10 _

students in the Black Studies de-
partment are now studying in Afri-
ca, and that other groups are plan-
ning similar trips. Students in the
Intercultural House will be meet-
ing with him next week to discuss

Hillside Dorm
Opposition

Keeps Trying

by JUDY VOLLMER

People’s Oakland is preparing- . ” I

for another hearing with the Uni-
versity and the City Planning
Commission (CPC), continuing
the opposition to the University’s
proposed hillside dormitories.

The hearing is slated for Feb.
23 in the Public Safety Building,-
and, in contrast to a January hear-
ing, will focus completely on tech-
nical aspects of excavating, grad-
ing and actual construction.

A spokeswoman for_ People’s
Oakland, Kim Fellner, stated,
“Our lawyer and a small number
of community residents will at-
tend the hearing to talk about the
legal'ity of the.University’s con-
struction procedures. The hearing
is the result of the University’s
having filed under the wrong sec-
tion of the zoning ordinance. We’re
going to question whether the ex-
cavation will cause land shifts or
cracks in sidewalks.

Fellner explained that the grad-
ing requirements are more string-
ent under the correct-ordinance.

The CPC can say no to the Uni-
versity’s proposed expansion, but,
according to Fellner, opposition
is unlikely.

“If the city does say no,” Fell-
ner continued, “the University
will be in phenomenal difficulty.
The General State Authority
(GSA) frowns upon going against
local governments and is likely
to put the University in an uncom-
fortable financial position.”

Should the CPC approve the
University’s aim to build the dor-

 mitory complex, People’s Oak-

land can appeal their case to (lity
Council within 90 days. There may
be still another public hearing.
City Council must vote, regard-
less of the CPC’s decision.

“During the past several
months People’s Oakland has
been an amazing way of mobiliz-
ing people in the Oakland com-
munity,” Fellner stated. “Citizens
are realizing that they have the

Assaults, Thefts

by NANCY RUTHER

Seated in his office in Varsity
Hall, Robert K. Merritt cited com-
munity co-operation as the major
goal and stumbling block for the
Security Services Department
which he heads.

“The Pitt campus is fragment-
ed so the Security Police neces-
sarily work in the entire commun-
ity. Our major concern is still the
faculty, staff and students.

Merrit quoted department stat-
istics for ’69. saying, “Assaults
and thefts on students in the
dorms are down from ’69. This is
probably due to having beat pa-
trols on campus at critical times
and, of course, the security locks
in the Towers and increased desk
personnel in the quadrangle.

“Thefts on University property
remain unchanged,” he contin-

ued. “One of the main targets is’

purses which are too often left
unguarded. A secondary target is
typewriters, which are extremely
easy to fence. This sort of Univer-
sity equipment is“ not insured or
properly inventoried and the loss
must be covered by someone, gen-
erally through tuition.”

The largest part of thefts could
be avoided ifcommunity mem-
berscould curb their laziness.
Last year the department found
34,000 unlatched doors~0pen in-
vitations to burglars. Merritt gave
the example of the person who
cashed a $350 check, left it on his
dresser, took a shower, and re-
turned to find the money gone.
“Three hundred and fifty dollars
is a high price for an unlocked
door," Merritt said.

To minimize personal attacks
like purse-snatching and mug-
gings, the department is planning
a brochure, self-defense for wom-
en, similar to Los Angeles‘ “Lady
Beware.” Merritt considers pub-
lic awareness a major responsi-
bility of his department.

Perhaps even H greater is the
need for the community to be
aware of its role in its own secur-
ity. “There is a very, very fine
line drawn between ‘the fink’ and
the concerned neighbor calling the
police for help.

“No matter how ‘petty the mat-
ter may seem, every crime

should be reported. All personal
descriptions of criminals are on '

file here and downtown so we can

.watch for repeating offenders. A

report is often necessary for in-
surance purposes, too. It’s diffi-
cult enough to catch a petty thief
or a mugger but without commun-
ity support it becomes impossible.’

A spokesman for the city said

City meter maids appeared un-
perturbed about the entire affair.
Though ‘prevented from reading

plans for a summer of African ex-
perience.

In Lagos. Nigeria, Chancellor
Posvar said that he visited the

- staff of Pitt's Public Administra-

tion Program at Ahmadu Bello
University.

I_n addition to outlining his Afri-
can trip. Chancellor Posvar com-
mented on some of the issues fac-
ing the University at present.

In response to a question of
whether or not he expected some
outbreak of student violence or
dramatic reaction due to the Lao-
tian invasion, Chancellor Posvar
said that if it was going to occur,
“it would have happened before.”

He said, “Laos is different on
a scale than Cambodia, but indeed
a violation because of govern-
ment involvement.” He referred
to Russel Baker’s article in The
New York Times which satirized
the fact that a great debate was

, occuring over whether or not they

should entitle the Laos incident as

an “invasion” or “incursion.”

The Chancellor, said that al-

though the University receives

about $27 or $28 million of Fed-
erally allocated research funds,
classified research for the govern-
ment “was terminated three
years ago” and University policy
“prohibits weapon or otherwise
classified research.”

“Only in the case that the na-
tional interest required research
for the national security would
Pitt begin classified projects.”

“We’re very far from that sit-‘

uation today,” he added.

“Much of the federal allocation
is directed to the medical or
health—related areas,” he said.

‘Posvar said that the present is
“a very poor time to make pre-
dictions” about the financial sit-
uation. This year, the financial
budget is not a “life or death is-
sue” but,an “austerity period is
in order.”

“It’s not time to be gravely
alarmed yet,” he said, “but we
can never rule out the possibility
of disaster.”

The Chancellor also clarified
the question surrounding the Eu-
dowment Fund. He said that the
nearly $80 million is the accum-

William Kunstler, Harry Swan-

gan, representing the Five, are
trying to establish what they term
as a “chilling effect" has been
created due to a bad faith usage
of state legal power. Describing
this as a “reign of terror,” they
say it has been caused by police
over a_ period of several years but
it has to be proven that the actions
of policeiserved to intimidate “the
expression of first amendment
rights.”

Criminal charges were filed
against the Five by Satchko and
several other officers. . These
were incitihg to riot, assault and
battery, and resisting arrest.

The defense of the five, in addi-
tion to their previous charge, is
asking that the criminal charges
be dropped.

Concerning the University’s de-
fense for spreading into the com-
munity, Fellner maintained, “The

question they’re raising is who’s

going to benefit from a certain
type of housing, but you don’t wipe_
out another community to solve
the problem. The question that

"su—r’fa,ces is whether you want your

city to be one large institution or
a collective group of citizens, stu-
dents, businesses, and profession-

‘_ al centers."

Commenting on the overall ef-
fect that People's Oakland is hav-
ing, Fellner said, “No matter
what happens, I think that there is

a much better working relation-
ship between students and com-
munity residents now. Some bas-
is for a relationship grows just
by working together.”

Fellner also stated that Baal-

“1776,to Open at Nixon”

History buffs and many non-
buffs have always found the Amer-
ican Revolution a most fascinat-
ing and intriguing subject, and it
has taken an ex—history teacher,
Sherman Edwards to put them to-
gether in an original musical com-
edy about it called, appropriately
enough 1776.

The National Company of
this musical which has been ac-
claimed as “America‘s award-
winning musical" will make its
debut here at the Nixon Theatre,
Pittsburgh, on Monday, Febru-
ary 22. The musical will remain
here thru Saturday evening,
March 6 and matinees will be
given on Wednesday and Satur-
day. ,

The musical, since it opened
on Broadway over a year ago,
has been the winner of the Tony
Award and the New York Drama

Critics‘ Circle Award, and had
the honor of being the first mu-
sical, in its entirety, to be pre-
sdnted at the White House.

“I776” is a musical comedy,
not a musical pageant, revolving
around the Declaration of In-
dependence.

Irish women’s movement nil

By VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

There is no place for a massive women’s movement in the inci-
pient Irish Socialist Revolution because what women are struggling
against does not involve sexual equality, said Bernadett Devlin in
‘an .intprview after her speech Monday.

“The measure of the success of this is that there has never been

‘Ia conflict between men and women because revolutionary move-

ments deal with the whole question of oppression,” she continued.

In Northern Ireland where poverty rates are high and education
levels are low, men and women revolutionaries are fighting together

7 against a total system of economic, political, social and, tangentially,

religious discrimination.

The women’s liberation movement there, due to its middle class
British-orientation, is counter-revolutionary. Devlin insisted that the
movement women, are “looking for equal positions with their male
counterparts, the landlords and property owners.”

A “They are not prepared to

places with the working class
male who is a sight worse off
than they are,” said Devlin. “I
don’t identify with the female

Of ,, course, women are paid
less, restricted to the traditional

lous” if they complain. “But
when women become involved in
the struggle, they see clearly
their role as revolutionaries” and

The Women’s Suffrage movement of the 20’s in the United

A States provides a further example of what Devlin is criticizing in the

Irish movement.

The majority of the women who marched for the right to vote
were middle class women whose exclusive goal was gaining electoral
equality with middle class males.

It was a one shot-deal that failed to push for the elimination of
the other social, political" and economic repressions of the female.
This orientation precipitated internal conflicts and splits which re-
sulted in the secession of a faction, led by anarchist-socialist Emma
Goldman,“ devoted to a total revamping of the capitalist system.
These women pledged to represent lower and working class women

 

“What /Ya Smilin’ At Boy?”

by DON MARBURY
Editor

A couple of years ago I went
to Birmingham, Alabama, my
parents home, for a vacation. I‘m
reminded of the trip now, after
reading Ralph Ginzburg’s new
book, 100 Years of Lynchings,
and because it was one of my
first real contacts with outright,
unconcealed racism.

The little town we stayed in
was comparable to the Hill Dis-
trict in terms of its physical re-

lationship to the downtown area, A

but Ensley, Alabama was phy-
sically, much worse off than the
Hill. ‘

My first shock was the hous-
ing that Ensley Black people
lived in. To call them decrepit
slave huts would be a euphem-
ism. Oh, not all the housing was
like this, my aunts street was
fairly nice, comparatively, but
there seemed so many streets,- so
many homes that looked as
though they should just have
been blown up, and the empty
lot serve the same purpose.

My cousin had warned my
brother and I that it was not
wise to just walk the streets at
night, because the police would
stop us for sure. I scoffed, “If
we aim doing nothing,” I ration-
alized to him in my Northern
thinking mind, he can’t do noth-
ing to us.” He related an inci-
dent that had occurred a few
weeks before we had arrived.
He and another friend had been
walking down their own street
on their way home just after dark,

his head in the window, and when
he complied the cop rolled up
the window, and hit him about the
head with his stick, while almost
-screaming the words, “I done
told you about loafing on these
streets late at night.”

I looked at my cousins face.
He hadn’t been kidding us. And
all I could say was, “But damn,
this is 1968, we don’t have to
take that kinda stuff no more.
Did y’all report him?”

My cousin gave a worried very
nervous, “aint no need in mak-
ing trouble.” And I remembered
that Ensley had been near the
scene of the bombing of a Black
church, in which two little girls
were killed, not to many years
before, and I stopped querying
him.

We were riding through the
middle of downtown Birmingham
during the day, and a car-load
full of young white boys pulled
up beside us, and kept yelling,

 

and their needs and demands.

Devlin’s attack against the British women’s liberation movement

was not directed to thevolving U.S.struggle.

“Lettuce? Lettuce? Boycott?
You’ve got to be kidding.”

«This was a common response
to those who recently circulated
a petition in support of the let-
tuce boycott. Many students were

ignorant of what the petition said

and stood for. ~

Many times I have had to give
15 minute explanation just to get
one signature. On the other hand,
the mention of the name of Cesar
Chavez brought quick signatures.

The history of the boycott goes
back to July 23 when the lettuce
growers met with a Teamsters af-
filiate in order “to feel them out”
as a possible union for the work-
ers, according to court testimony
given by Cal Watkins of United
Fruits on Sept. 1.

On July 28. the Salinas Valley
growers announced that the
Teamsters had been chosen to

represent the workers and that

they (the growers: had signed a
contract which afforded the field
workers a ten cent raise after five
years of labor with no fringe bene-
fits.

No restraining measures for
the use of pesticides was includ-
ed. This contract was signed with
no imput from the affected work-

    Lettuceyoo impedd

ers. An immediate walk out oc- if
f curred and scabs were brought in

right away by the growers.

A meeting between the United
Farm Workers Organizing Com-
mittee and the Teamsters result-
ed in a jurisdictional agreement
allowing the UFCWO to organize

the farm workers. The Teamsters P‘

offered to relinquish all their con-
tracts with the growers, although
as of yet, many have not done so.

The petitions currently being
circulated is asking the Universi-
ty and SAGA Food Service to
cease buying non-union lettuce
and instead purchase union pro-
ducts.

A series of recent meetings
with University officials and
SAGA personnel produced no def-
inite answer or decision on this
issue. The Food Policy Commit-
tee meeting scheduled for this
week has been cancelled and re-
scheduled for March 2.

SAGA has promised to purchase
UFCWO lettuce if it’s available
(which it is) and of good quality.
But so far there is no evidence of
union lettuce at any of the Univer-
sity cafeterias.

If this University does buy only

union lettuce, it will be one of .

the first Eastern universities to
do so.

when a police car stopped them.

“Hey boy, commere," my cou-
sin said the cop had ordered his
friend to do. When his friend
walked over to the squad car the
cop motioned for him to stick

AC W0 resolution

“hey niggers, hey niggers,” then
they sped on pass. I was infuri-
ated, and told my cousin to
speed up and catch them.

“You don’t do that down here,”
he admonished me, “they'll do

anything—throw a bomb in your
car.” Again I looked at him dis-
believingly, but again, he was
dead serious.

As we walked home from an-
other relatives house a little af-
ter dark, the previously foreshad-
owed squad car slowly approach-
ed us and stopped, I decided
that I was going to put my cou-

sin’s story about the head beat-
ing one of his friends had suffer-
ed for no reason, to the test.

“The cop got out of the car
and came cautiously towards us.
“What you boys doing out here?”
My cousin quickly explained that
we were his cousin’s from Pitts-
burgh, and that we were coming
from another relatives house.

He scrutinized my cousin’s
face then went to my brother’s
who was cautiously smiling, then
his gaze fell on me. I tried to
give him the most vicious smile
that I could. '

And after pausing a while, he
gave me back an equally vi-
cious “What you smiling at boy-
like that, you see something you
don’t1ike?” '

I was about to speak up—to
tell him, “You’re damned right-
there’s a wholelot I don’t like.”
But I faltered. I was not strong
enough. The cop turned away
from us, with a satisfied grin on
his face.

But now just like so many
other black communities——Ens-
ley has changed. Black people
are not faltering anymore, and
they are telling the man, we
don’t like, nor are we going to
stand this anymore. Aint no more
racist cops, carloads full of
young white boys, and landlords
gonna turn away with satisfied
looks on their faces.

Federal funding of childcare urged

(Editor's Note: The following report and resolution was formulated
by the Task Force on Child Care of the Advisory Committee on Women’s
Opportunities (ACWO). Members include Marcia Landy (chairman), Judy
Rosenthal, Virginia Benke, Liz Scott, Charlette Babcock, Rae Siproin and
Elizabeth Schneewind. The resolution was unaminously approved by the
AC W0 and forwarded to the Chancellor, Executive Assistant Dave Powers
and the four study officers Monday.)

ACWO CHILD CARE PROPOSALS

THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD URGE CONGRESS TO ADOPT
THE LIBERALIZED PROVISIONS FOR CHILD CARE PROPOSED IN
S. 2986 FOR INCLUSION IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (SECTION
437 OF TITLE IV). THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD ALSO SUP-
PORT AUTHORIZATION OF FEDERAL AID FOR CHILD CARE FOR
FAMILIES NOT COVERED UNDER THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE
PLAN, WITH AT LEAST A MODEST APPROPRIATION IN 1970.

Lack of adequate child care facilities has been found to be a major
deterrent to solution or even significant progress in providing greater
education opportunities for children, reducing the welfare burden, giv-
ing greater dignity and self-respect to mothers on welfare, filling criti-
cal manpower needs in shortage occupations and providing real free-
dom of choice in life style for women. ' -

Every Federal and State study of the status of women has refer-
red to the necessity for expanding child care facilities.

Department of Labor manpower experts cite lack of child care as
the most serious single barrier to job training or employment for low-
income mothers.

Our national goal should be:

1. A system of well-run child care centers available to all pre-
school children. Although priority would be given the needs of low-in-
come working/mothers, the facilities should be available to middle in-
come mothers who wish to use them. "

2. After-school activities for school-age children at all economic
levels who require them. ’

The National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity esti-
mated this year that 700,000 migrant children need day care. Only 13,-
000 spaces are available.

The Council found that 1,373,000 economically deprived children
could have benefited from participation in full—time Head Start pro-
grams. Only 213,000 spaces were funded this year.

The Task Force endorses the Administration’s plan for increasing
facilities for care of pre-school and school age children, with priority
for low-income and welfare families.

(Continued on Page 5)

(Continued from Page 4)

In addition, we recommend that
the Administration support legis-
lation to authorize Federal grants

for developing child care facili-

ties for families at all income lev-
els, with at least a modest appro-
priation.

The funds would be used to con-
struct child care centers. expand
existing care programs, renovate
facilities, assist States in improv-
ing their licensing standards.
train professional and sub-profes-
sional staff, research, food pro-
grams, and a comprehensive
study of existing child care pro-
grams at Federal. State and local
levels.

Cited from: Hearings before the
Special Subcommittee on Educa-
tion of the Committee on Educa-
tion and Labor. House of Repre-
sentatives — Discrimination
Against Women.

The following ACWO child care
proposals are divided into sec-
tions: a) general child care as-
sistance and b) child care cen-
ters. The committee is not only
concerned with child care centers
but also problems that faculty,
staff, graduate, and undergrad-
uate women have with work/
child care conflicts.

The committee believes that
the university—in its commit-
ment to end discrimination
against women—should recognize
the urgency of child care needs
and begin to act immediately
and on a large scale to allocate
the needs.

I. GENERAL CHILD
CARE ASSISTANCE

A. The university should grant
maternity leave with pay for
women according to the medical
and financial needs of the woman
(up to a period of six months) sub-
ject to negotiation with depart-
ment heads and supervisors. In
cases of disagreement. referral
should be made to appropriate
grievance procedures.

B. The university should active-
ly lobby for better deductions for
child care on income tax; that is.
it should actively lobby for an in-
crease in the maximum amount
now allowed for child care on in-
come tax. The university should
actively lobby for a.n increase in
the maximum salary under which
a couple can deduct child care ex-
penses.

C. The university should create
a clearing-house for information
on existing child care in the uni-
versity and in the community.

D. The university—in addition
to the child care centers discuss-
ed in Section II—should encour-
age verbally and by scholarships
or. other financial rewards those

faculty, staff. and students who
wish to set up child care facilities.
(This refers to small-group child
care projects like communal or
alternative life style group struc-
tures.)

E. The university should enjoin
department and unit heads to
work out flexible programs and
reasonable scheduling in order
to reduce child care/work con-
flicts.

F. Women with children should
not be discriminated against in
the hiring process, nor should un-
married or married women have
to account for a potential family.

G. The university should create
part-time jobs for women. jobs
with status, appropriate fringe
benefits, voting rights, rights in
voicing policy, and security.
These jobs should be occupied by
women who do not desire full-time
work, not by women who are forc-

 

ed to take those jobs because /they
have no proper child care (or for
other reasons of sex discrimina-
tion).

H. There should be child care
allowances for working women in
salary negotiations. Those hiring
and setting salaries should recog-
nize that since the woman has
been considered the child career.
she has had to assume the costs
of paying for a surrogate. Her
employee can alleviate the in-
equity of her paying to work by
adjusting her salary to include
child care expenses.

I. Child care expenses should be
considered reimbursable for con-
ferences. week-end or evening
meetings undertaken as part of
one’s legitimate work load.

11. CHILD CARE CENTERS
A. Child care centers should in-
clude all who need and desire

child care~—faculty. staff, ad-
ministration, graduate. and un-
dergraduate students.

B. The child care center should
provide infant and child care.
Children from 1-5 who need all
day care should have available
facilities on the university
grounds. ‘

C. There should be after school
care for the 6-12 year olds.

D. The university should active-
ly lobby to change existing laws
governing child care centers. es-
pecially those laws that concern
the care of children under three,
also those laws that prohibit the
setting up of adequate child care
centers because of so-called in-
adequate facilities.

E. There should also be affili-
ated day care centers or homes
for the 0-3 year olds coordinated
with the child care centers.

./'I,‘\':,\\\
aw’: ”‘
‘ ‘ - oz? %

F. Access to child care should
not be determined by poverty lev-
els but should be available to all
who need it.

G. Fees should be paid by the
university for those unable to pay,
and a sliding scale should be set
up according to income, so that
people can pay according to their
economic circumstances. Those
capable of paying can pay full
cost. (Perhaps child care service
can be free for all in terms of di-
rect payment. but a fee can be as-
sessed through registration or
salaries for the service.)

H. Adequate space must be
made available for child care cen-
ters. There should be maximum
utilization of existing facilities.
Perhaps Falk School can be used
for after-school care center. A
survey and report should be made
of present dormitory space for

immediate utilization. All new
residence buildings, particularly
the new Hillside complex, should
include specially designed child
care facilities.

1. Existing educational and
training programs for child care
should be evaluated and expand-
ed, new training programs creat-
ed for both men and women in the
child care/day care field. Pro-
grams should look to eradicate
racial and sexual stereotypes.

The programs should stress
much more flexible models of
male and female roles. and they
should stress equality of talent
and opportunity" for children and
should allow the child to explore
attitudes, learning skills and
games which were in the past at-
tributed to one sex or the other.

J. Teaching of theory. concepts
and principles of child develop-
ment and child care should be
distinguished from training; both
are of value. but on different lev-
els and with differing flexibilities.

Further, the acquisition of
skills in child care (training)
must include adequate knowledge
so that the carer will know
when an expert opinion, an inter-
vention, or continued and special
care must be sought in order to
meet the variance in the state of
the human condition.

K. Provision should be made
for both multiple academic Uni-
versity functions in addition to the
provision of child care on behalf of
women who want to learn and/or
to work.

L. A central office should be
created—staffed by feminists——
responsible for coordinating ex-
isting and future child care fa-
cilities, programs, and general
needs.

There should be coordination
between institutional child care
development programs and the
office? also coordination between
this office and instruction in Wom-
en’s Studies, and/or an Institute
for Feminist Studies.

M. The university should sup-
port and expand the Arsenal
School. and its programs in order
to provide competent, concerned
child care for the university com-
munity.

For Courage

Editor. The Pitt News:

Lawrence Lee ranks as one of
the most conscientious and cour-
ageous professors at this Univer-
sity. At a time when higher edu-
cation is in danger of foundering
upon the shoals of pseudo-intellec-
tualism and academic irresponsi-
bility, Professor Lee stands as a
beacon in the night.

He adamantly refuses to sur-
render precious academic ideals
to those who would transform Pitt
into a grandiose kindergarten. He
has dedicated his life to the pur-
suit of excellence; would that we
do the same.

As evinced by his poetry and
newspaper columns, Professor
Lee celebrates the human experi-
ence. He brings to his subject a
deep reverence for all worthy as-
pects of life; sincerity and com-
passion color his character.

I consider Edward Miller’s vul-
gar remarks of Feb. 15 to be in-
dicative of the noisy, non-think-
ing element at Pitt. Such impu-
dence toward a high—principled
and well-intentioned human be-
ing reflects a callous disregard
for respect, a virtue too‘rarely
practiced today.

There exists a difference be-
tween criticizing a man’s ideas
and attacking that man personal-
ly. Since Mr. Miller has not yet
learned this difference one won-
ders what he has learned in nearly
four years of college. His egregi-

ous outburst strengthens Profes- '

sor Lee’s case.

Running agai/nst Richey in the

the Russian 1500 metric mile

Banner also expects’ a good
performance from the mile re-I
lay team. If everything 1 goes
well, the relay team could end
up being winners. 

So far this year, the mile re-
lay has had it’s difficulties, but
they feel that if they can put it
all together for the first time
this year, they could run away
from the competition. But, it
will be no easy task.

“Were running in a very tough
heet”, said Banner, “we could
do very good, but you never
know what to expect in indoor
track.” '

Rutgers, one of the few-.teams
to boast a victory over the Pitt
relay, will be in~the same heet.
as the Bannermen. In that win,
a Rutgers man stepped in front
of Smittie Brown, and the time
lost denied Pitt the win.

Things like that have been
happening to the team all year
and the unexpected, as Banner
terms, can always happen.

Along with Pitt and Rutgers,

the tracksters will run against Man-

hatten which sports a i‘good”

Resorting to an aggressive, run
and shoot attack, the Pitt Panth-
ers turned away the Lafayette
Leopards, 88-72, enroute to their
twelfth win of the season Wed-I
nesday night at_the Field House.

Starting out slow but. picking
up momentum as the game pro-
gressed. the Cagers took the lead.
11-8, with five minutes gone in
the contest. From that point on
the Cats gradually added strength
to that lead and won the game

“handily.

.“Our boys were aggressive out
there tonight, there's no doubt
about it,” said Pitt Coach Buzz
Ridl. “We were ready for the

game.”

Lafayette, now 14-7 on the sea-
son, was heralded as a high scor-
ing team. Their leading point
producer, Tracy Tripucka, set
a modern Lafayetterocord for
career points in the game. He is
also the twelfth highest scorer
in the nation with a 27-point
average per game.

Tripuckalhad to settle for sec-

ond place tonight, as his team .

mate, Walt Kocubinski led all
scorers with 24 points. Tripucka
had 21. Kent Scott was scoring
leader for the_victorious Panth-
ers, connecting ‘for 19 points
(9—or-14 from the field).

“They (CW. Post) arevery
very good”, said,Banner.. 7

Despite outstanding perform-
ances all year long, Smittie
Brown will not compete in the
600 in the Olympic Invitational.

“They are very selective",
said Banner of the selectors, “It’s
one of the best meets and they
will have the best possible.peo-
ple there." 9

Even though he will not run in
the 600, Brown will run in the
mile relay team.

Ted Bobby had not been feel-
ing well last week and as a re-
sult missed out of some workout
time. Dennis Schatzman and Dore
Watley will round out the team.

While these athletes are com-
peting in New York Friday night,
the rest of the Track squad con-
tinues in its preparation for
the IC4A’s and the National
meets in early March.

Next Saturday, the team will
again travel to Delaware, for the
Delaware invitational, which is
also a top meet. The big meets
for Pitt still lie ahead and all the
tracksters are confident that they
can win. _ ‘ -

Leopard Coach Hal Wissel was
satisfied with the game but ap-
pearedto have a bone to pick
with the officiating.

“You’ve got a good ball club,”
Wissel said to Ridl after the
game. “You beat us off the
boards, and you beat us in the
game. I just want to say that I
felt the officiating was inconsis-
tent.” A

Wissel alluded to the fact that
he felt the refs ' were calling
things against his ballplayers
that were not called against the
Panthers; Ridl didn’t defend the
refs but pointed out that Pitt
usually gets hurt by the officiat-
ing when they travel, too.

, “When they asked me before
the season, what our toughest
game would be,” said Wissel,
“I said, ‘Pitt at Pitt’. And we
play teams like LaSalle and
Fordham. It’s because the boys
have to adjust to the kind of game
Pitt plays and the officiating
here.”

In the glory of gaining their
12th victory in 19 starts’, a crush-

ing blow was dealt to the Pan-
thers. Early in the second half,
Mike Paul, Pitt’s - consistent
starting forward, was involved
in some contact under the boards
and when he came down he hurt
his ankle.

According to team doctor
Smith, Paul could have sustained
a fracture of the bones in his
ankle. If not,

game for x-rays. —

When Paul got hurt, the Pan-

of the way into the second half
and coasted to their 16-point

‘In the early 60’s, Harry Lundy‘. probably didn’t get much
national recognition although he set the all-time scoring record for
Lafayette College. Jerry West, Jerry Lucas, and others gained national
prominence for the collegiate performances.

Tracy Tripucka. On _Wednesday
night against the Panthers. Tri-
pucka broke Lundy’s nine year
mark with 3:02 left in the first

V half. v

Scoring his ll81st point on a base
line drive, Tripucka did in a lit-
tle over a season and half what
it took Lundy three\full seasons

to accomplish. Presently, Tripucka

ranks twelfth in the nation in scor-
ing with a 27-point average.

Lundy, who works for Swindell
Dressler Co. as a project manager
in «Pittsburgh, had the opportun-
ity to see his record broken in
person. ‘ -

“I can’t say that I get a chance
to see many Lafayette games
because I don’t get back too of-

ten to Easton,” Lundy said after A

his alma mater had lost. “I nev-
er expected to see it ——‘in fact I
didn’t know that anyone was
close until my neighbor called
me last night and told me about
Tripuka.”

Lundy compiled some impres-
sive statistics between the years of
1959-62. As a sophomore, he
ranked fifth in the country in
field ,.goal percentage, and as a
senior he was the nation’s sec-
ond leading rebounder, ahead of
Lucas.

“I wasn’t a good shooter, but
I- got a lot of inside shots,“ he
said. “The type of offense that
our coach George Davidson used
was a _ball control one which

‘ slack of the departed Pistol Pete in the Southeastern Conference.

meant that we only took good
shots.”

After graduation, Lundy passed
up tryouts with both the New
York Knicks and the Detroit Pis-
tons infavor of graduate work at
Northwestern.

Now, Lundy finds little time
for playing basketball. “Basket-
ball is a big thing to me and I
have always had a great interest
in the game,” he related, “But
I only play occasionally now. I
feel very strong about athletics,
and I feel working hard and pull-
ing together for a winning team
is important."

Seeking 3rd Triumph

By JAN FRY
The swimmers travel to Syracuse University today for their
next—to-last meet of the season with a record breaking attitude.
“We all want to win," remarked Pitt Acting Coach Dick Brad-

shaw. “We'll do everything we can to win. I’ll never lose a meet
if I can help it. However, we’re working on improving our times for

the Easterns.”

The coach explained that the Pitt lineup will be juggled around
so the swimmers will be able to qualify for the Easterns in different

events.

After winning Tuesday in the
Grove City meet (the swimmers
second victory of the season)
Bradshaw described the team’s
spirit as high.

“We’re up for everything,” he
boasted. “The boys are feeling
pretty good.”

Emphasizing the fact that the
swimmers personal improvement
in times is the squad’s main ob-
jective, Bradshaw also remarked
that they can still channel their
efforts towards winning two
more meets.

The Orange men with a 4-3

season record will present, as,

Bradshaw put it, “pretty decent
competition.” Most of their vic-
tories were close, with the last
relay deciding many of them.
Bradshaw doesn’t believe that
their relay is “very strong at all.”

“However, Brian Krause, in
the 1000 free, is a little stronger
than Rickie Rowe.” the coach
explained. “Rickie could do bet-
ter in the shorter race. It’s.really
atoss—up.”

Krause, who has picked up

Pitt’s women’s cagers slapped
an 84-13 loss on Robert Morris
College Wednesday night.

The second and third stringers
went most of the way for Pitt.
‘'1 was really surprised that they
were so good,” stated Pitt‘s coach,
Sandra Bullman. “Even with both
co-captains, Elaine Kingas and
Phyllis Wojciechowski, not play-
ing the girls still were outstand-
mg.”

Pitt led throughout the contest.
Outstanding scorers were Pitt‘s
Tana Casciola with 24 points,
Roni Fensterman with 16, and
Ellen Ganley with 13.

“Roni was beautiful — she play-
ed beautiful ball,” related Bull-
man. “She’s quite a hustler.”

“Nan Roberts also did well —
she was consistant on most of
her shots. She just needs a little
more accuracy,” said Pitt’s coach.

Coach Bullman feels, “it was
an entirely different team that
played in the first two games.
Due to the leadership of the co-
captains the team work and team
spirit are finally here.

“Tonight, everyone proved
they were good enough to be
on the team.”

The next women’s basketball
game will be at Edinboro. 1 p.m.
tomorrow,

Coach Bullman is not expect-
ing any great problems. “We
should have a good chance of

beating them. They have a cou-
ple of good outside shooters who '

are accurate, but they don’t

have much in height.”
