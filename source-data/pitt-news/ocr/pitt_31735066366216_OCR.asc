Sororities to Have
Limitations Raised

By ALAN DISLEB

The University Women Fraternity Committee has ap-
proved a proposal from Panhellenic Council that limitations
on sorority membership be "raised to 45 undergraduate plus
senior members for a two-year trial period, according to
Shirley Boatman, president of Panhellenic Council. Previous
limitations were 35 undergraduate members plus senior

members.

Miss Boatman explained that
“Panhellenic Council discussed
this (the raising of limitations)
and drew up a proposal and pre-
sented it to the Dean of Women
(Savina Skewis) and the Wom-
en's Fraternity Committee."

The Council, which is com-
posed of each sorority president
plus one delegate from each so-
rority, presented eight reasons in
defense of the increase in limita-
tions. Reasons given included the
fact that “the percentage of

Law School Committee

Thomas M. Cooley II, Dean of . the School of Law, re--

signed last August because he wanted to “relinquish the
deanship and return to full time teaching,” conﬁrmed Dr. A.
C. Van Dusen, Vice-Chancellor of the Professions.

Dean Cooley agreed to stay at the University until a
new dean could be selected, but he was offered a professor-

ship at the University of Illinois
law school and was granted a
leave of absence.

Presently an executive commit-
tee of full professors, with W.
Edward Sell, as chairman, offer-
ed their services until a new
dean is named. ‘‘I am doing what
an acting dean would do,” said
Sell, but added that he had noth-
lng to do with the actual selec-
tion of the new dean.

“This is quite satisfactory
to the central administration,"
stated Vice-Chancellor Van Du-

\

sen. There is no rush “just to fill
the vacancy. “The administration
wants the committee to take the
time “to ﬁnd the very best _man
and indeed that's what we're
doing.”

A screening committee is re-
viewing candidates and will ad-
vise the chancellor on a selected
slate of names. So far “the can-
didates suggested are outstanding
people," state -Vice-Chancellor
Van Dusen.

Moderates

Hawthorne House, in conjunc-
tion with Men's Dormitory Coun-
cil (MDC), will hold a Forum at
6:30 tonight in Tower A Lobby.
The Forum participants will be
Eric Stern, Student Government
(SG) president; Bill Cabin, edi-
tor of The Pitt News; Rick

Schweder,, SG senator, and Jim

Smith, former social events
chairman of SG. ,

The purpose of the Forum is to
present a better understanding
of the role of SG,at the Univer-
sity and to clarify major SG is-
sues such as the student activ-
ities fee.

Ted Blair, Hawthorne House
counselor, said, “It was the‘opin-
ion of members of Hawthorne
House that many of the political
issues were clouded with emotion

‘and personality conﬂict.”

The technique of a Forum was
chosen to present the views and
recommendations of the four
speakers. ,

Each participant will open with
a ﬁve minute statement on “What
should be the role of SG on the

. members

Greek women is . . . decreasing,
due to the limited number of
permitted in each
group”;
would decrease the ﬁnancial bur-
den on each member; and “a
greater number of Greeks (would)
support, strengthen, and spread
their system as a whole.”

Also, an increase in member-
ship would spread responsibility

Week As Success

By WENDY HERMAN

Union Week, held by the Stu-
dent Union Board (SUB) Sept.
10 through" 18, has been deemed
a success by its planners. Accord-
ing to Sherree Merenstein, chair-
man of SUB, “It was an attempt
to show the students and faculty
—particularly the freshmen-——the
variety in programming and the
facilities in the Student Union.”
When asked about the possi-
bilities of a future Union Week,
. Miss Merenstein said, “In gen-
eral it was a success, and we

would like to make it annual.”
The Union Dance Sept. 10 had
an attendance that surpassed all

dances during the past year.

On the following night, SUB
sponsored the ﬁlm Breakfast .at
Tiffany’s at Clapp Hall. Because
of inadequate facilities and in-
sufficient funds to permit a third
showing, over 100 people had to
be turned away.

Due to a University ruling
against programming on Sunday,
and a shortage of persons avail-
able to show the various offices
to those attending, the Student
Union ope_n house was not the
success which SUB had hoped,
according to Miss Merenstein.

Commenting on Monday after- ‘

noon’ls social hour, she said, “A
lot of people didn't seem to un-
derstand why punch was being
served. This was started during
the summer, and the students

In a large university, the stu-

though certainly exaggerated.
However, the problem of anony-
mity is a real one, and according
to an informal sample taken this
week by this reporter, the Uni-
versity's administrators can also
be unknown to a number of
students.

The sample, comprised of 15

Addicts at 12

While in San Francisco this samnwr, Miss.
Epstein spent two days observing Syna-
~.non. Synanon’s five other houses are in
Tomales Bay, San Diego, and Santa Mon-
ica, California; Reno, Nevada; and Greens
Fa/rms, Connecticut.
 “I began smoking pot at the age of '12.
,-:I’d left school and bummed around the
Bronx. The next few years it was barbitur-
I tes, morphine, and heroin. To get the
:dough I stole small things like hubcaps and
TV TS.” ,.
This is how Tony described the begin-
jing of his dope h bit. He was caught steal-
’  “ ing at the age of 19
and sentenced to two
years in prison. Hear-
ing about Synanon he
arranged to spend his
jail’ sentence in Sea-
wall, the San Francis-
co house.
Synanon was found-
‘ ed to cure the addict.
,«j,3‘ Seven years ago
‘i ‘ ' Charles E. Dederich, a
, member of Alcoholics
Anonymous, held informal meetings in his
Ocean Park, California, flat. His sanctuary
‘for alcoholics soon opened its doors to dope
addicts, and the _alcoholics, considering
-themselves better than the addicts, refused
to return.

DEVOTING himself to .curing the ad-
dict, Dederich realized that living under one’
roof would provide a better therapeutic
community. In September, 1958, 40 mem-
bers moved into an old store front building
in the slum area of Santa Monica, Cali-
fornia. One of these members, an illiterate
junkie, stumbled over the words ,“seminar"
and “symposium” and coined the word
“synanon” which the organization has used
ever since.
Seawall was an 100 year old warehouse
which Synanon, converted into a home for
85 people. The members rebuilt the plywood
floor, and added electricity, modern bath-
rooms, a living room and two bedroom,
areas.
“ All the formeraddicts at Seawall have
backgrounds. Slum areas throughout the
country are full of junkies selling dope to
children 12 or 13 and to adults 30 or 40.
.There is no age limit. All that is needed is
money. A 12 year old boy may see hisfriend
 buy dope and try it “just for kicks.” But
‘ soon the kick becomes a habit. When money
is scarce cough syrup, sniffing glue, or
/other substitutes are tried but the user
‘turns to stealing or prostitution to get the
. real thing. ” i
' THE GOVERNMENT builds hospitals
-‘and jails to cure junkies and dope addicts
-but rumor, around Synanon has it that it is
easier to get supplies inside a jail than it is
on the street. According to the former ad-
_ diets only a small percentage of the inmates
in these government institutions are cured.
I Synanon assumes that the addict is

childish and stupid. To grow up the member
must give up drugs, end his desire for them,
and feel secure without them. '

When an -"addict enters Synanon he is
treated like “cold turkey” which means he
sweats it out on the living room couch with-
out.drugs for two or three days. A doctor
is on call at all times but is rarely needed.
The addict no longer’ has access to drugs,
and must end his desire forthem.

The synanon game (with a small “s”)
is the next step. Ten people in a group re-
lease their pent up hostilities by challeng-
ing one another’s thoughts. A new member
is questioned about how he began the drug
habit, why, and what troubles it had caused.

THIS EARLY stage of residency is
known as the “honeymoon period” because
for two or three months ‘the addict does
simple tasks like washing dishes‘ or work-
ing in the kitchen.

For an hour each day members discuss.

a phrase or saying by a well-known writer
or Synanon member. This is tostimulate
their thinking and to encourage self-im-
provement. Each Synanon’ house has a li-
brary, and classes are held several hours a
day. . » .
After several months -a member may
work canvassing the community for sup-
plies or working in Synanon’s warehouses
or workshops. Seawall, for example, has its
own lithography equipment with a press,

I stones, inks, and handmade papers. It hopes

to become a National Art Center very

' shortly.

TWELVE MEMBERS of Synanon’s
Santa Monica house run a gas station, as
another. work project. They earned enough
money to move their‘ house from a slum
area to _a middle class neighborhood. Both
the houses-in San Diego and Santa Monica
have machine shops. Synanon Industries, a
machinist company, hopes to earn enough
money to make.Dederich’s dream of a com-'

.munity in Tomales Bay come true.

The Synanon 900 acre village in Tomales
Bay would house. 5,000 former addicts. It
would include buildings for seminars, art

studios, workshops, meeting halls, a thea-

ter, a library, and an administrative center.

After proving himself capable of doing
managing work, receiving spending money
each week, and going out with permission,

the addict is considered cured. He has spent_

anywhere from two to three years in Syna-
non, if he didn't “split” (leave).
When the former addict feels secure

enough, two paths are open to him. One is’
to return to the old neighborhood, stay off __

drugs, and lead a normal life. The other
is to "remain in Synanon’s administration
and assist_ in forming new branches or
“hustling” supplies and food from commun-
ity members. ‘

Most former addicts, ' however, remain
in Synanon’s ideal community because they

fear returning to.the “square” world. They -

Editorial: Forum For What.
Each forum member will be asked to comment in an equal amount of
time on each question. "There will be no criticizing between participants,

allowing the audience to weigh all views unadulterated by high-pitched
emotionalism and personal attacks. ’ -

But plans are not enough. They must be carried out, without altera-
tion. The moderator, the members of Hawthorne House, the forum mem-
bers, and the audience must all bear this arduous task.

In Earnest

Student government meetings have degenerated to the personal level
too often. Good intent has been subsumed in a flurry of emotionally-
oriented oration. " “

If those involved in the forum are interested in clarification not con-
fusion, they will abide by the guidelines. Anyone who deviates will prove
d not with the issues, but with personal gloriﬁcation

Anyone who deviates from the committment to avoid emotionalism and
personality conflict will prove that his entire stance in the issue has sacra-
ficed the interest of the student body for that of the individual. Those who
abide by the forum’s guidelines will be serving the students.

Good Doing Business

..’

It seems that I have never
received my invoice, so, the
other day my friend, Gatz,
and I decided to pay a visit
to the Office of Student Ac-
counts.

We found the lines exceed-
ingly long, but we 'weren’t
very surprised since we fi-
gured many people were

 .probabl'y in

line to com-

plain about

the Towers’
air condition-
,in , or the

service in the
I Tuck Shop, or
_ V lone thing or

SOLOMON three hours
in line, so I missed all of my
afternoon classes. This was
okay with me. In fact,
I would give up a good class
for even a mediocre game of
tic tac toe, ’I love the game
that much.

FINALLY, I arrived at a
cashier's window. The secre-
tary ‘there was busy with
some paper work, so I just
waited for her to look up
and say, “Hi.” She did not
say, “H1”, or anything else

‘ friendly. She just looked at

me with such a straight face
that I'm sure many poker
players have offered her
great sums of money to
teach this look to them.

“Miss,” I said. “I never re-
ceived my invoice. Could you
ttell, me what has befallen’
1 .

She looked at me for a
minute and said, “Get ahold
of that girl over ‘there and

. ask her.”

THIS I‘ DID. It turned out
to, be a drastic mistake. You

see, when a party has to see

more than one secretary in
any one office he is immedi-
ately considered a general
nuisance and is viewed with

great displeasure. Gatz real- ‘

ized this and left. me alone
to fend for myself. He's a
real sweethart, Gatz is.

The new secretary hated
me instantly. She walked
away, came back,,curled her
upper lip, and glared at me,
very hostile.

“Miss,” I repeated, “per.

. hape you can tell me what

has become of my invoice?”

came "back and sai-d as fol-
lows, “It appears we don't
have your invoice. What’s
more, we may never get it.
A teacher of yours forgot to
include a notation and your
invoice is, for all intents and
purposes, non-existent. You,
my friend, are up the pro-
verbial creek.”

This broke my heart. I re-
membered the Old Dave the
Bone legend, a parallel to my
case. Dave the Bone gothis
grade report once without
his political science grade.
This, in turn, held up his in-
voice. The teacher who for-

got to‘ include the grade,

moved to Cambodia. As there
was no alternative, Dave the
Bone made a special trip to
Cambodia, returned to Pitt

 in late October and was

forced to pay a._ late fee.
Would I be ‘another Dave the
Bone? I was very upset in-
deed. ' '

But then the scales of
Zeus tipped in my favor. In-
to the office walked the only
person who could help me.
‘I went up to him and ex-
plained my problem. - He
looked up at me and winked,
“Don’t worry, kid,” he said.
“Just go back to your fra-
ternity house and look for
the mail tomorrow.”

Sure enough, the next

morning my invoice arrived I

special delivery. And then it
came to me. The person who
had been in the Office of
Student Accounts was Maz,
a ‘friend to the needy. [Not
only is Maz powerful enough
to get results ‘from Student
Accounts, but he has a heart
as warm as the Cathedral

him either. -

_ Letters‘ To
Publications Ask
Fast Allocation

Editor, The Pitt News:
Congratulations on your stand
concerning the allocation of the
activities fee. We are glad to see
that someone is keeping the bas-
ic issues in focus and demanding
immediate action. ,
As heads of student organiza-
tions which can directly beneﬁt
from the moneys, we deplore the
confusion, political manuvering,
and bickering presently clouding
allocation of the activities fee.
Each of us is in theprocess of
planning our programs and ac-
’tivities for the\rest of the ‘year.
We need to know now whether
we will be receiving any more
ﬁnancial aid via the activities fee.
January is too late to plan for
the year's publication goals, to
expand on engineering magazine
and to take color pictures of
Homecomingfor the yearbook.’
Since every student will ulti-
mately beneﬁt from the expan-
sion of our programs we do not
feel that we are being selﬁsh in
demanding that the activities fee
be allocated as soon as possible.
We urge Student Government to

stop its internal bickering and . ,

philosophizing and to fulﬁll its
ob1igation—aPDOint its two mem-

V bers to the allocation committee

and get the money to the or-
ganizations which need it.

“THE BEST OFFENSE IS A GOOD DEFENSE”

: » '0 When two teams play “I forg°t,h0W 130 Play defense
-‘Tbetter than you,”. the result is 111_ points. The RahadS,_ the
Panther defensive unit, seemed like they couldn t wait to
'5 get back to the bench and hide their heads in embarrass-
ment. The reason they were on the field for such a Short
aitime is that they offered so little resistance.

but the Rahads (Dahar spelled backwards) couldn't make
;{'-the clutch defensiVe P133’ to stop the omnipotent offense of
.West Virginia. The game was a rerun of the ﬁrst years of
‘:the American Football League when the offenses were bet-
"ter than the defenses.

 Josh Novogratz, corner linebacker for the Panthers,
‘felt that the Mountaineer attack was extremely good, but
not as good as the Rahad g-ndders were bad; Some of 0111‘
eguys didn’t do their assignments, some weren  hitting hard,
rid all in all’ we just had guys lying down and not domg
:-what they should on almost every play.”

' ’ “Weknew what they had and how to defense them but
1we'just weren’t,hitting hard enough and possibly arm tack-
‘ling too much. We knew what would happen if We let F 0I’d
get outside and he did. Guys were just commitmg them-
elves too early.”

.The game disproved the old addage that ‘‘.a good de-
ffense is the best offense.” There was so little defensive re-
istance that West’Virginia gained 624 yards and the Pan-
thers totaled 447. Some one had to be lying down with those
"statistics. « s .

Mountie Head Coach Gene Corum. thought that both
teams were unsure of themselves. “I think it is just a ques-
tion of both teams being off balance and not being able to
'el1.”'
J The Panther defense had better jell soon because they
-will be facing some of the best backs in the country in the
A upcoming weeks. Floyd Little, Syracuse; Nick Eddy, Notre
.; . Dame, and Mike Garrett, USC are just three.

 They might have faced the best one they will face_all
 season in Garret Ford. His great speed and clever running
enabled Corum to call him, “the easiest. player I’ve ever had
; to coach.” ~ ~-
o The porous right side and the weak middle of the Pan-
~ ther defensive line were the places where Ford found the
 biggest spaces. When he didn’t run he was catching passes

behind the weak defensive halfbacks. ._
 Fullback Dick Leftridge had a problem when he ran.
‘ He couldn't decide which hole to run through in the Rahad
line. 'Most hf the time he solved the problem by running
over them just to make sure that there was someone facing
the West Virginia linemen at the line of scrimmage.

The defense knew they played poorly and possibly it
..doesn’t help to belabor the point, but their ineptness was
the cause of the downfall of the visitors at Mountaineer
Stadium. Defensive Coach John Steigman knew it, but he
' also wanted them to forget it. \On a bulletin board in the
‘P Panther dressing room after the game Steigman composed
a sign which read as follows:

—“The Rahads must dedicate every moment of
lives to see that this never happens again. That is
the.only way to wipe it out of your minds.”

Although both defensive units were horrible, the of-
fensive stars of both teams shouldn’t be overlooked. Ford
and Leftridge were great, but their running was compli-
“mented perfectly by the pa_ssing*of Allen McC’une, who had
eighteen completions out of 425 attempts.

,The game answered one question that has bothered
Panther football fans. It is now fairly obvious what ex-
’ Chancellor Edward Litchfield is doing, he is the offensive
nbackfield coach for West Virginia. '

' drubbing that both their teams’

i~ The offensive platoon caught up to the Mountaineers,

   

 
 

 

By FRANK SMIZIKi
The most spectacular foot-
ball game of the season was
played before 35,000 amazed
fans at Mountaineer Stadium
Saturday. The partisan West
Virginia fans saw the Mount-
ties score 63 points to down the
Panthers who tallied 48.
Both head coaches, Gene Cor-
um and John Michelosen were
still in aistate of shock after the

defenses took. “I thought we could

win if we held them to three.

touchdowns,” said Corum. “It is

hard to believe that a team could '

score 48 points and still lose.’.’
Michelosen was hesitant to talk
of his defensive team and pre-
—ferred to talk of his offensive
unit. “I thought the boys showed

real spirit out there when they ’

were 21 points behind and still
came back.” _

After getting the ball three
times and not scoring the ‘Pan-
thers found themselves behind,
21-0, in the beginning of the sec-
ohd quarter. Ken Lucas started
to open up the offense with pass-
ing to Mike Rosborough and a 46
yard run by Bob Dyer. The ﬁrst
Panthers score was 13-yard pass
to Rosborough. ’ ‘

At the half the Panthers had
given upanother touchdown, but
had scored two more themselves
and trailed 28-20. When the sec-
ond half started the gridders
forced the Mountaineers to punt,

and then tied the score, 28-28, as ,

Ken Lucas ran for the two point
conversion.

West Virginia came right back
and scored as they powered down
the ﬁeld with the bulldozing run-
ning of Dick Leftridge providing
the impetus. Two personal fouls
also aided the_Moun_ties cause.

The Panthers had not quit driv-.
ing, and _ Eric Crabtree. ran 71 ~

yards on the _first play from ~

scrimmage. Bob Dyer threw the
key ‘block which broke Crabtree
loose as he danced through the
middle of the West Virginia line.

Both teams traded touchdowns,
and with ﬁve minutes left in the
fourth quarter, Ken Lucas tried
to send the Panthers ahead by
one point with a run for a two
point conversion. A bone-jarring

Pohl then tried an onside kick
which failed and West Virginia
took over on their own 48 yard
line. Unable to move the ball on
the ground for two plays, McCune
spotted Garret Ford behind a
Panther defender and ‘a 59 yard
pass and run play was the result.

Ken Lucas couldn’t get the

Panther attack on the move again

knowing that Lucas was forced to
throw put on a big rush. The Pan-
thers were forced to try to gain
20 yards on fourth down from
their own ten yard line and fail-
ed. A ﬁve yiard penalty moved
the ball back to the ﬁve and it
only took Ford one end run to get
West Virginia their ﬁnal touch-
down and make the score 63-48.

Booters Tie Grove City, 1-1
Both Miss Scoring Chances

By GEORGE LIES
Opportunities to score were in an abundance at Ken-
nard Field last Saturday, but the soccer team battled Grove

City to a 1-1 overtime tie.

In the first quarter, Cal Bonawitz broke up a Grove
City threat when he blocked a long pass intended for their

center forward, Scott Gay who was Waiting for the ball in
V front of the booters goal. After "

that, the soccermen applied the
pressure.

While keeping the ball near
the Grovers’ goal, the forward
line of Gary Foerstch, Dave Shaf-
fer, Sal Tavares, and Dam Millilo
shot continually at goalie Rich
Manley, until ﬁnally Shaffer, on
a non-scoreable assist from Molli-
lo, rammed the ball into the
lower right hand corner beyond
the diving goalie’s groping hands.

Grove City tied the score in the
second period as forward Fred
Kime intercepted Bill Zurzola’s
pass in front of the. booters’ goal
and kicked it up and over the
jumping goalie, Lou Cepanec.

Each team battered the other
for the. remainder of the game.

Once Grove City almost scored.
Darrell Sayer, accepting a pass
in front of the booters’ Cepanec,
tried to head the ball into the
goal, but his shot went over the
goal.

On the soccer team’s side of the
ledger, scoring opportunities were
lost when the forward Wings
missed kicks or where the wings
pushed the ball too far by the de-
fensive man and the ball rolled
out of play.

and scored three touchdowns im-
pressed Michelosen. “That 32 is
a big and real fast back. All I
could see the whole afternoon

was his number on his back after
he ran through our line.”

The School of Engineering and
‘Mines has changed its name to
the School of Engineering, ac-
jcording to Dr. Harold E. Hoel-
scher, dean of the School of Engi-
neering.

_ “We are changing the name to
describe more precisely what we
o_ here,” said Dr. Hoelscher.
«‘.‘Our concern is engineering. In

ling‘ for some time speciﬁcally on
inining engineering and not 011
other aspects of the field.”
The program in mining engi-
neering is now available through
the department of civil engineer-
ing as a twmdegree program. By
enrolling for an additional tri-
mester, the student may earn a
degree in both civil and mining
engineering.

9 The Departments of Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering have
also been combined to make the
structure of the school more com-
pact and to provide “maximum
program efficiency and minimum
organisational structure,” Dr.
 Hoelscher added. _ i
The consolidation is justified,
‘,he pointed out, because today’s
v_ petroleum engineer needs a solid
V background in chemical engineer-
ing. The University has the only
accredited curriculum in petrol-
V eum engineering east of the Mis-
sissippi, and was the first in the
‘ United States to establish a pro-
gram in this ﬁeld.
