UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

While Pitt implemented a
hiring freeze to cope with an
expected state-funding
shortfall, Pennsylvania State
University and Temple are still
unsure about how they will
deal with a disappointing
appropriation.

“[They] are in total disarray
on how they anticipate that
this will affect them,” saidjack
Freeman, executive vice
president, at last week’s Senate
Council Meeting.

Pitt asked for a $147.9 million
appropriation, a 12.8—percent
increase over last year.
Governor Robert Casey
recommended a 3.S—percent
increase, or $133 million.
Temple asked the state for a
14.5—percent increase over last
year’s appropriation, but
Casey's administration
recommended that it only
receive a 3.9-percent increase.

“This will probably make a

said George Ingram, Temple’s
director of news. _ ‘
Temple already had hiring
restrictions in place before the
budget announcement. A

said.

“If I wanted to ﬁll a
replacement position, Iwould
have to make a case in writing
to the committee stating
exactly why this person
absolutely has to be hired.”

Ingram said that like Pitt,
Temple has had faculty
members who have expressed
their discontent with the
current conditions.

“We have had a number of
faculty [members] complain
aboutthe way things are right
now. Some of them have gone
to the press,” he said.

Ingram said that part of
Temple ’s budgetary problems
have also been caused by
their hospital.

“Most of our patients are
poor and on [medical-
assistance programs]. There
is a serious lack of
reimbursement from the state
for [medical assistance], and
we expect to lose $13 million
because of that lack,” said
Ingram.

Pitt Provost Donald
Henderson reported at the
Senate-Council meetingthat
a proiected decrease in
enrollment would also affect
next year’s budget. Ingram

said that Temple is
anticipating that same
problem.

“Compared to last year at
this time, applications are
down. A decrease in
enrollment could have a
serious impact on our budget,”
he said. “All of these forces
together could spell some

Pitt students get ﬁnancial tips

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Pitt students seeking ﬁnancial
advice received it from Max
Haynes, executive director and
president of the Association of
Collegiate Entrepreneurs, who
gave two separate speeches
yesterday. I

The speeches kicked off a
nationwide tour by Haynes, which
is being sponsored by Citibank/
Visa. He appeared at Pitt courtesy
of the Pitt Program Council.

“The key to ﬁnancial success is
to learn how to manage your
earnings,” Haynes told the
audience in Dining Room A of
the William Pitt Union last night.
He also spoke in Forbes

Quadrangle earlier in the day.

In his speech, Haynes deﬁned
success as “achieving your goals

I and getting what you want.” He

then listed his steps to achieve
this goal as: A
o ﬁnancial freedom
oreality realization
0 ﬁnancial control
-building a dream
One of the top factors to
success, according to Haynes, is
the ability to take responsibility.
“People have to take
responsibility - for both their
successes and their failures,” he
said, “Of our top 100 ranked
businesses, all of them blame
themselves for failures while
taking credit for their successes.”
But he said the most important
factor for success is the ability to
visualize goals daily. “When you
are able to see your goal everyday,
it makes you work harder for it,”
Haynes said.
Haynes also gave the crowd a
few financial warning signs.

Soviet dissident author speaks

For the Pitt News

individuals on personal typewriters and passed
around various cities in the Soviet Union.
As government pressure built up, so did the

Renowned Soviet author Evgenii Popov spoke
about the secret meetings of the Literary
Underground in the Soviet Union to a group of Pitt
students on Tuesday night. '

When asked if he was a political writer, Popov
said, “Politics should be written by those called
politicians.”’ Popov said that some people consider
him political because he writes of topics that the
Soviet government says do not exist, such as
alcoholism and prostitution.

The Slavic Club sponsored the lecture by Popov
in which he discussed the Literary Underground, a
collection of Soviet writers whose work had never
been published due to the government's censorship
rules. Popov referred to the Underground as a
group of “poets widely known in narrow circles.”

He went on to explain that the Underground met
in secret, usually in one of the writer's apartments
or in one of the local’s house. They would meet
covertly for fear of being found by the militia.

Popov talked about the circulations of the Literary

_ Underground. Most of these stories were typed by

  

‘production of literary material.

Underground writers, such as Popov, would ask
people to “be realists; demand the impossible.”

Popov has been writing since the age of 10. Most '

of Popov’s short stories are written in a humorous
vein. These stories are written from the view of the
working class in the Soviet Union.

Since Popov started writing, he has had many
stories published in such popular Soviet almanacs
as Zenlaala and the more famous Metropol Popov
is currently working on a book about two youths
walking about on the day of Breshnev’s death. The
book is not yet titled.

Associate Professor Nancy Condee said that the
lecture went “extremely well,” and she was pleased
with the number of people that showed. The
reason for Popov’s visit was because of the large
number of American Slavics that admire his works
in the area.

Condee says due to the Gorbachev reforms,
more and more Soviet artists and writers will be
visiting the United States

daily expenditures,” he said.
“Also, if you don't know how
much you owe, it’s a very bad
sign." _

He pointed to credit cards as a
source of tension. “Credit cards
should be used as a tool for
convenience and emergencies,"
he said. “They should not be
used for daily use. That's when
people hit problems."

Haynes also said that now is a
good time for students to start a
credit history. “Banks are willing
to offer credit to college students,"
he said, “because once they hit
their junior year, most students
will graduate, get a job, and be
able to pay off their bills. It's a
gamble they're willing to take.”

Haynes offered advice during
the seminar on ways to save
money.

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News
V Max Haynes gave some useful ﬁnancial advice to students.

“Any time money comes across
your hands, set aside 10 percent,”
he said. ‘If you get some

unexpected money, set aside 50 ’

.percent. Most people go out and
spend money they get from a
raise right away. You’ve livedpwn
the smaller amount before, just
keep doing it." 

' He also offered suggestions ‘en
how to cut back Socially. “The
hardest things for me to give up

. in college were drinks and dating,”

he said. “But you really don’t
have to give all of it up. Only
occasionally, and that will save a
lot. .

“Some people think it’s cool to
ﬂip out a credit card on an outing
and say, ‘I'll take care of it,’” he
said. “But more people thought I
was even more cool when, by

Gays and Lesbians,” Jennifer Cala-
brese misrepresents circumstances
regarding ROTC and grossly mis-
quotes statements made by my-
self. At no time did I make the
statements attributed to me. Fur-
thermore, not a single word from
the written statement which I
submitted to the author appears in
the article.

I was advised about the mis-
quote before the printing of the

‘ article and spoke to the author
. and Matt Martin, editor-in-chief of

The Pitt News. Even after my
emphatic statement that the al-
leged quotes had never been made,
the author as well as the editor-in-
chief insisted on printing the mis-
quotes.

If the misquotes were recorded
accidentally, then the author is
guilty of careless negligence in
not admitting the possibility of
error and in printing the misquotes
after prior notification of their
inaccuracy. If the statements were
deliberately altered, then she is
guilty of malicious wrongdoing.

Much of the’ article is based
upon false or misleading informa-_.
tion. The article gives the clear

impression that Elaine Burns, who -
I claims to have left ROTC when
' she ‘discovered that she -was a

lesbian, was a cadet at Pitt and that

rahér statements about her ofﬁcer’s
?»i>al’-flti-homosexual bias pertain to
“tl’i<‘!commissioned officers serving

§‘E’Pitt. However, at no time was

. ‘lilhfine Burns a cadet at the Univer-

 of Pittsburgh,‘ and never to
‘tlié-fir recollection have any of the

rhfrficers of the Panther batallion

made her acquaintance.

I This entire article is a display of
gross journalistic irresponsibility
by Jennifer Calabrese and by Matt
Martin, who placed a mistaken
faith in the integrity of the author.
She tries to do damage to ROTC’s
image and to portray cadets as
anti—homosexual bigots. She suc-
ceeds in neither. Few students will
dispute the Army’s policies or
ROTC’s respected position on
campus.

The Army determines policy for
all units, including ROTC, based
on what will best aid it in complet-
ing its mission. Army ROTC at the
University of Pittsburgh will al-
ways proudly comply with these
policies. We will directly and
honestly state our aims and be-
liefs. We will not seek to evade the
truth nor to misrepresent ourselves.
And we will always continue to
serve the nation to the best of our
ability regardless of what the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance, 7hePittNews,
or anyone else may say.

Grievingover Greve ,

We are writing this letter to fur-
ther clarify the statements made
by Charles J. Greve and Co. ‘in
their “Our Side" advertisement.

Unfortunately, that ad does not
give an accurate depiction of the
situation.

To begin, we astenants of CJG
and Co. were ready and willing to
meet with David Greve and a Pitt
News reporter to discuss our prob-
lems. The reporter showed up
Wednesday, Feb. 7 as scheduled;
however, Greve didn't. Presently,
David Greve refuses to speak with

Letters  

us and other tenants involved in
this situation, contrary to his ad
which states that he is “always
willing to meet with" tenants if
problems arise.” And we had a big
problem with having our names
used to solicit business in a paid
advertisement full of misconcep-
tions to which we did not give any
consent, written or otherwise. A I
In the ad we are asked, “If it was
so horrible an apartment, why did
the tenants renew their lease?" Yes,
we did renew our lease, but not
because we were so happy, but
because we didn't know any bet-
ter. We moved in to our apartment

in September of 1988 and were

told we hadto decide to renew our
lease in January of 1989. After only
four months, naive as we were, we
still believed Greve’s empty “prom-
ises.” Later we learned that ﬁled
maintenance requests would not
be fulﬁlled. Or if they were, they
would take an inordinate amount
of time. For example, our bath-
room ceiling you read about was
fixed Thursday, Feb. 15 after one:
and a half years of requests. We
also learned never to believe ver-
bal promises made by any land-
lord. Now, after almost two years
of grief, Greve wants to know if we
will renew our lease with him at a
reduced price for next year. Sorry,
Greve, last Wednesday we signed
with a different management
company.

With regards to this “favorable

letter” that Greve has on ﬁle, let us
tell you what that letter was about
One of us wrote it thanking Greve
for allowing our rent to be a little
late. Apparently, it was -written
prematurely. Shortly after that,
Greve attempted to sue us "for not
paying this rent and several other
months’ rent totaling over $1,500.
This came after weeks of our re-
peatedly going to his office with
cancelled checks to prove that our
rent was paid. Apparently, he “lost”
it, or that was his explanation. It
should also be noted that Greve
never did “find” all of our rent
money. Funny how he found that
letter, though!

About the bannister that Greve
repaired “within 24 hours": he
repaired it within 24 hours aﬂer
having it dropped off in his oﬂice.
What about the one anda half years
that we went without a safe stair-
case before that?

About the 24-hour-a-day answer-
ing service: sure, they'll answer the
phone ‘when you have an emer-
gency late at night or on a week-
end. They’ll answer it and give your
message to Greve  on Monday or
in the morning. What good did that
do us as our toilet was flooding the
bathroom floor all night or in the
morning when wehad to take a

rshower? _ *

of how Greve’s ad does not tell the
whole story. So be wary of what
you read in an advertisement be-
cause they are only trying to get
your business. Know what you're
getting yourself into and get all
promises in writingbefore you sign
any lease. We sure wish we had!

Unsatisﬁed tenants of CJG and Co.

Wing Dinged at CJ's

To those who think Tuesday night
is still wing night:

Tuesday night is chicken-wing
night at Pitt. C.J. Barney’s is always
packed with students who would
like to get their minds off their
schoolwork and their hands on
some wings at a very special price.

Certainly I am no different. I like
wings, but more that that, I love
special prices. So, last Tuesday
night I took a break from what
seemed to be my latest load of
impenetrable homework assign-
ments and ventured off to C.J.’s in
search of the perfect wing-ding
deal.

BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED!
True, their deal is matchless, but
for all the wrong reasons.

Not too long ago, $5 would buy
50 wings and a side order of
crunchy celery and savory bleu-
cheese dip. That's because wings
used to be 10 cents apiece, while
celery and bleu cheese were free
of cost.

More recently, however, their
wings inﬂated 5 cents in price

.. without inﬂating S centsin meat

Celery, too, is no longer gratui-
tous; an additional $1 is being
collected for that traditional pleas-
ure.

NowI admit I was getting a little

ticked off, but what went down
last Tuesday night was the straw
that broke the camel's back. Wings
went up to 20 cents apiece. Now
let's face it, this is no longer a deal.
It’s a steal, and we students are
getting robbed. Sorry C.J.’s, but
from now on I'm going down to
the Giant Eagle to purchase my
wings for Tuesday nights, and I'll
get more wings for a cheaper
price. Heck, I'll even buy a stalk of
celery. At your prices every night
is wing night here at Pitt!

On Jan. 25, The Pitt News in-
cluded an issue of the college
magazine, Campus Voice. CVfea-
tured an article on campus hate
across our country. ‘Currently,
campus publications report the
growing problem of bigotry, hatred
and violence against people. I
would like to highlight just a few
gruesome examples:

(1) At the University of Conne cri-
cut, eight Asian-Americans were
verbally harassed by a group of
football players looking for a ﬁght.
One victim related, “They spit on
us  called us ‘Oriental faggots’
and sang ‘we all live in a yellow
submarine,’” (as reported in The
Nation, Feb. 26, 1990).

(2) At the University of Wiscon-
sin, a fraternity held a mock slave
auction with its pledges in blackface
(as reported in TbeNation, Feb. 26,
1990).

(3) At the University of Pennsyl-
vania, the United Minorities Coun-
cil chairman received a taped hate
message on his answering ma-
chine. The caller said, “We're
going to lynch you, nigger  1 We
are going to lynch you," (CV, Feb.

1990). .

And don't think Pitt or the Pitts-
burgh area is excluded:

(1) On Feb. 12, ﬁve white, male
skinheads, of the fascist variety,
stormed a party in South Oakland.
They were hunting “fags.” A few
gay men were victimized. However,
no one felt comfortable reporting
the incident to the police.

(2) I hear “fag” and “nigger”
jokes regularly on campus. At Pitt,
bigots eloquently vandalize bath-
rooms, elevators and hallways with
hate-filled graffiti (e.g. “niggers
suck" in a Tower C elevator).

In the wake of September's
gaybashing/murder in Schenley
Park, the bombings of offices of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
and the killing of a North Carolina
civil—rights worker, we need to
address the rebirth of hatred spread-
ing throughout the country. Uni-
versities are a good place to start a
war on bigotry, prejudice and
ignorance in our “kinder and gen-
tler” America.

Caring people have a responsi-
bility to ﬁght bigotry and its physi-

Protestors, anyone?

Bob Beckel — Democratic con-
sultant, American Democratic As-
sociation member, manager of the
Mondale and assistant of the
Dukakis presidential campaigns,
and a staunch opponent of Contra-
aid —— was treated to a horrifying
and rude awakening on a recent
trip to Nicaragua.

Beckel joined

Sandinistas this weekend, espe-
cially being that the violent Sandin-
ista actions have probably low-

ered the campaigning incentives 4»
of the opposition groups over the -

pastfew weeks.

Now, this event happened over
two months ago. And as I’ve
roamed campus glaring at all the
’ left-wing V plac-

a bipartisan
delegation or-,
ganized by the
Center for De-
mocracy on a

  Paul
  Kengor

ards calling for
protest matches
against U.iS>riaid
to El Salvador
and omnipggsent

trip to observe

~ the campaign processes of the Nica-

raguan Sandinista leadership and
various opposition parties in order
to analyze, assess and monitor the
pre-electoral process.

Upon venturing to a routine
opposition-campaign rally with the
other delegates, Beckel witnessed
a peaceful rally turn to bloodshed
as Sandinistan thugs proceeded to
wreak havoc and mutilation upon
the unarmed, defenseless opposi-
tion.

The Sandinistas proved that they
could outdo even Manuel Nori-
ega’s Dignity Batallions of last
summer's Panamanian elections as
they Gestapoed into the crowd
and proceeded to attack opposi-
tion supporters with nail—studded
clubs, rocks and machetes.

Worse yet, and lo and behold,
right in front of Beckel’s anti-Con-
tra-aid eyes, one of Danny Ortega’s
Sandinistan cronies whipped out a
machete, hacked off one woman's
arm and neatly drew a deep “X”
across the chest of a man from the
opposition rally with his machete
in a lovely Samurai-type fashion
that probably would have made
Ghenghis Khan coo.

The liberal American media sur-
prisingly did manage to find some
time in their evening news broad-
casts — working it in with the
three-month ongoing media blitz
of the Salvadoran military’s murder
of the sixjesuit priests —— to feature
the Sandinista atrocity that occurred
that day.

The whole event has kind of
dampered hopes for the promised,
“fair” Nicaraguan elections by the

stickers staging
“Stop the U.S. War in El Saly,gdor”
(inaccurate but effecdve),m:iind
“Stop U.S. aid to El Salgagor,
now!” I've eagerly awaited ia.,.s,ign
displaying something to the ef-

fect of “Stop the Sandinista blood- "

shed!" or “Tell your Congressman
to support the Contras."
Needless to say, I haven't seen
or heard any rally cries. Where
are the protestors for this act of
barbarism by the Sandinistas?
Additionally, according to
Puebla Institute, a Washington
human-rights organization, by
rnid—December at least seven of
the Nicaraguan opposition had
been murdered, 12 had disap-
peared, 20 had been arrested and

.30 had been assaulted. Many have

had their property confiscated and
their homes or campaign head-
quarters sacked.

But yet something else is rather
odd: the protestors of U.S. aid to
El Salvador have been extremely
persistent in their demand that
the Salvadoran government ne-
gotiate a coalition government
with the unmistakably strict Marx-
ist FMLN guerrillas. One must
wonder: Can't they at least hold
one march demanding a post-
ponement of this weekend’s
Nicaraguan elections, for the sake
of the abused opposition parties?

I can’t logically ascertain why
the left would protest a rnilitary-
influenced but - democratically
elected Salvadoran government,
but not a communist, equally
abusive Sandinistan government.

An explanation is in order, and
long overdue.

Lokar's 41 points against Pitt falls fiveshy of season total

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

Seton Hall guard Oliver Taylor
will probably never be late for
pra_ctice again. His tardiness gave
freshman Marco Lokar a chance
to start his first collegiate game
and he responded with a 41 point
output in the Pirates 86-81 victory
over Pitt on Tuesday night.

Lokar, a freshman from Trieste,
Italy, had seen limited action in
the 14 games he had been in. He
was averaging 3.3 points per game
and about ten minutes of playing
time. His 41 points placed him
five shy of his season total of 46.

“If you go into a game thinking
you are going to score 40 points,
you are not going to score 40
points,” said Lokar. “I came into
this game thinking aboutwinning
and the points came along with
that.”

Lokar's banner evening placed
him two points shy of former
Boston College‘ guard Dana
Barros' 43 point Big East high
against Pitt on January 7, 1989.

The Pirates’ guard now holds
the Big East freshman record for
most points scored in a game.

This honor was previously held
by Georgetown's Michaeljackson,
who had Slagainst Syracuse on

Swimming oz fr/tll—timej0

Byjennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

When Theresa Picklo was just
10 years old, swimming took
over.

“I started when I was six. When
Iwas 10, swimming became more
important than anything else. I
would still do other things but
only if they didn't interfere with
the swimming,” Picklo said.
“Every year since then I have just
gotten more and more serious
about it.”

Picklo is now a junior on Pitt’s
women’s swimming team and
was a Big East and Eastern
finalist in the S00-meter and the
1,650 freestyles in the past two
seasons. She was recruited by
Pitt and is on a partial swimming
scholarship.

“When I first started swimming,
I did some of the shorter
distances, but gradually I went
over to the [longer] distance side.
I guess that my body just has
some sort of natural endurance,”
Picklo said

Picklo practices with Pitt’s team

foul line and sunk two field goals
from two—point range in the first
half.

Lokar missed the first nine
games of the season because he
had to decide if he wanted to
come to America. “Seton Hall
isn’t around the corner from Italy, ”
he said.

He spent the fall playing for a
semi—pro team in Italy. Former
Seton Hall player Mergin Cina
was trying out for the team and
the two became friendly since
Lokar was one of the few English-
speaking players. He told Cina
he would like to play ball for a
college team and Cina called the
Seton Hall coaches.

Seton Hall assistant coach Rod
Baker went over to Italy to watch
Lokar and liked what he saw.
Lokar talked with the Seton Hall
coaches and decided he would
like to come here. In October,
the NCAA gave I him special
permission to take the Scholastic
Achievement Test during a non-
testing time and he scored above
the required 700.

His parents who are both
professors in Italy played a big
factor in his decision. They
wanted him to receive a college
education but one can't play
basketball and go to school at the
same time in Italy; whereas in
America you can do both. His
mother had been visiting him
during her semester break and
his performance on Tuesday was
the last game she would be
attending.

Lokar was also familiar with
America since in 1985 he was an
exchange student at Bishop
McDevitt High School in
Philadelphia. As a result of his
experience, he developed a
fondness for this country. “I like

“I love swimming, and so I do
it all year round,” she said.

Picklo said that her family has
played a big part in her success as
a swimmer. Both of her sisters
are also involved in swimming.

“My parents are real positive.
There’s a tendency for some
parents to get too involved. They
support me, but it’s not too much,”
she said.

“We all support each other.
There is competition on the team,
but it is a good type of
competition. We cheer each other
on. It makes all of us work harder,"
she said.

Jennifer Sari, who is a freshman
on the team, said that Picklo is
definitely one of the team's
leaders.

“She is a great person to look
up to when you swim. She is
definitely a team player,‘ Sari

the people here,” he said.

The rise of cable television
also gets credit once again. ESPN’s
Big East game every Monday
gets shown in Italy. Lokar enjoyed
the style of play and said he
especially enjoyed watching
Seton Hall’s drive to the final four
last season. He said many players
in Italy dream of playing college
ball here in the wide open style
of American basketball.

Lokar remained very
humbledespite his impressive
performance. “I'm just thinking
about school tomorrow and
UConn [Connecticut] on

Saturday, ” he said. He never even
dreamt about the night he was to
have since he had never played
so much.

Seton Hall Coach PJ. Carlesimo
is pleased the way Lokar has
progressed and expects big things
from him. “He’s playing with more
confidence and he's comfortable
with what we’re doing,” he said.
“I think the more confident he
gets the better he will be.”

On several occasions the Seton
Hall student section saluted Lokar
with chants of Marco! Marco! Lokar
said he appreciates the fans but
doesn’t really pay attention to the

crowd during the game. He said
he likes the American fans who
are good to his team even when
they lose.

Lokar”s night led to
comparisons between he and last
year’s Seton Hall sharp shooter

Lokar said he has heard about
Gaze but never saw him play.
Gaze drew criticism when he
went back to Australia following

Lokar has no plans to leave
college in the near, or even distant,

said.

Though she dedicates a lot of
time to practices and
competitions, Picklo, who is a
libera1—stu.dies major, said that
swimming hasn't affected her
grades.

“During the time that we have
practice, I seem to study more
because I know that I only have
so much time. Sure, sometimes I
come home from practice and
don’t do anything, but most of
the time I do get things done,"
she said.

Despite her dedication, there
have been times when Picklo has
considered quitting swimming.

“Last summer I was really
unsure about whether or not to
continue, but I did a total turn-
around," she said.

Swimming has given Picklo,
who was born in Plum, Pa.,
numerous opportunities to travel
around the country.

“When I swam in high school,
I got to travel to Alabama and Ft.
Lauderdale. It was fun to go on
those’ trips, but it's even better
now because when we go, I get
to see a lot of different colleges,”
she said.

Picklo said that she is unsure
about what she wants do with her
future, though she might want to
some day coach swimming. For
now, she is looking toward this
weekend's Eastern Women’s
Swimming Championship atTrees
Hall.

“I want to improve my times.
I’m hoping to do some of my best
times. Hopefully, I will be able
to,” she said.

Ski team travels to Re gio nals

By Jim Iakely
Staff Writer

The Pitt ski-racing team will
compete in the postseason Mid-
Atlantic Regionals on the slopes
of Great Gorge in Vernon Valley,
N.J., this weekend. This is the first
time the 5-year-old club has
competed on this level.

In the past, the ski team has had
problems with time trials. The
people formerly at the top of the
organization were favoring
certain skiers to race and others
not to race. This not only
weakened the team, but caused

internal problems. “This year we
wanted everything to be on the
up and up,” said Co-President
Jeff Smith. “Everything has come
together.”

Representing the Allegheny
Conference along with Pitt are
Penn State, ‘.lCl-(I'l€ll and the
University of P znnsylvania.

Smith said ‘ AL Pitt has talent
comparable to any team in the
conference. However, it ﬁnished
fourth in the conference this
season.

“This year, we had the potential
to finish second or first [in the
conference], but we only came in

fourth [behind PSU, Bucknell and
Pennl,” said Smith. “But it was
very encouraging to see the
improvement of the team over
the season."

“You can be a really good skier
and look great going down the
mountain, but when you get on a
race course, you look lbadl,” said
Smith. “There is a big difference
between knowing how to ski
well and knowing how to race.”

Representing Pitt will be team
captain Anthony Carestia, Carl
Skylling, Rob Alarcon, John
Dimaggio, Jeff Smith and Karin
Helm.

1 Q A THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 22, 1990
Swimmer Albright’s illustrious career down to wire

BYJim Iakelv
Staff Writer

Swimming is one of those sports
which takes place during a season
that is overshadowed by football
and basketball. However, this
long, grueling season demands a
lot from its athletes from October
through March. What cannot go
unrecognized are the exceptional
athletes who carry on the tradition
of Pitt swimming excellence. With
Sandy Albright finishing her ﬁnal
year at Pitt, a look back on her
swimming career exempliﬁes that
tradition.

In her youth, Albright played
volleyball, softball and was a
cheerleader, but in seventh grade,
she discovered that her vehicle
for stardom was in the pool. “My
parents never pushed me into
any sports,” said Albright. “They
let me choose for myself and
gave me support in whatever I
did. Swimming was what I had
the most success at and had the
most fun doing.”

TOUCH OF GOLD
Jewelry Store
114 Meyran Ave.

Albright was one of the most
successful high—school swimmers
in the Pittsburgh area, receiving
four All-American honors.
Coaches from national-swirnrning
powers Clemson, Penn State,
West Virginia and Florida State
all tried to recruit her, but she
decided to follow in her
grandfather’s footsteps to Pitt.

At Pitt, she joined one of the
most successful swimming
programs in the East. The
Panthers have won eight straight
Big East Championships, and,
going into this season, head coach
David Belowich has been named
Big East Coach of the Year five
times in seven Big East seasons.

“So far my freshman year has
been my best,” Albright said. In
that 1986-87 season, she swam
the backstroke leg of Pitt’s 200-

- medley-relay team.

“What a nice situation it was to
have an incoming freshman make
such an impact on the team," said
Belowich. “The first major meet
we had, she was on the 200-

medley relay team that broke a
record by three seconds, and that
is just unheard of. Her career
really took off from the very
beginning, and she has since
added to that in a very tremendous
fashion.”

That record, set by Albright in
the backstroke, Laure Walczak in
the butterﬂy, Jodi O'Neil in the
breaststroke and Susan Hickman
in the free, still holds today.

Albright’s freshman year was
highlighted by qualifying for the

' NCAA championship meet in the

100 backstroke, along with being
named Honorable Mention All-
American and Big East Swimmer
of the Year.

“Sandy had a great freshman
year and a good sophomore year,”
Belowich said. “In her junior year,
there were some things that were
a distraction to her that maybe
kept her from adding on to all she
had done in the past. Losing
focus and being confused about
life in general reﬂects in her

Petland

swimming.

“With the amount of academic
pressure that she was under [18
credits in both the fall and winter
terms], it was amazing that she
was able to hold herself together
as well as she did and do the job
that she was able to do.”

Albright is a 21-year-old
elementary-education major and
will - finish the program in four
years with a 3.0 QPA. Along with
her swimming duties, she is also
a student teacher. Due to a change
in policy, Pitt’s elementary-
education program now takes
five years to complete.

Swimming has a unique quality
that sets it apart from other sports.
An athlete can feel as though she
just swam a great race but then
look up at the scoreboard and the
great time is just not there. Great
leadership is needed to bring out
the best in any team, and co-
captains Albright and Walczak
handle the job beautifully.

According to Belowich, “Their
leadership has been marvelous.

CELEBRATE

  SPRING BREAK ‘9O

IN FT. LAUDERDALE AT

We have a very large team, the
largest we have ever had here.
That in itself creates problems.
You have to have some good
leadership day to day.

“The coaches can lead to a
point, but it has to come from
within the team. Certainly the
leadership qualities that she has
shown helped tremendously to
create a focused team. She is
doing as good a job as any captain
that I have ever had," Belowich
added.

Albright will finish her four
career-holding school records in
the 50 back, 100 back and the
200- and 400—medley relay. She
hasn’t qualified for the NCAA
Championship meet yet, but will
give it one more try this weekend
in the Eastern Women’s
Swimming Championship at
Trees Pool.

“I’m really fond of her. I’ll miss
her a lot. She has been a very
instrumental part of the program.
She is a good person, and you
miss good people,” Belowich said.

For The Morning After...

 
 

By Steven Heineman
For The Pitt News

At first, I thought it was odd
that the Pittsburgh New Music
Ensemble was presenting the Art
Ensemble of Chicago, but that
just reﬂected my misconception
of David Stock, P.N.M.E.’s founder
and conductor. He seemed
surprised when I asked him why
P.N.M.E. had included the Art
Ensemble in its season.

“In many ways it is different
from the rest of the season, but
that’s one of the reasons we
wanted to bring litl," Stock
explained. “First, what [it plays] is
obviously ‘new music.’ Second,
[it has] never been in Pittsburgh.
Third, [it’sl terriﬁc!

“On top of that, we’ve never
presented anything specifically
from the black perspective, and

we've been presenting for some
years. Well, there was the String
Trio of New York four years
ago.”

Stock couldn’t say exactly what
the members of the ensemble
have in store for next year, but he
indicated that they will continue
to deal in this kind of diversity
wherever funding allows.

The Art Ensemble of Chicago
has an all—encompassing range.
The group's maxim since its start
in 1967 has been “Great Black
Music -Ancient to the Future,”
proclaiming its superhuman
ability to navigate the continuum
of African and Afro—American
music like time travelers.

This is more than a simple
matter of keeping up a body of
chops. Collectively, the Art
Ensemble is one of the most
comprehensive living
encyclopedias of music on earth.
As trumpeter Lester Bowie said,
“There '5 always somebody in the
Art Ensemble who knows
something about everything.”

You may hear it do anything
from a Charlie Parker tune to a
spiritual shout, but it doesn’t cram
it into a “style.” It doesn’t evoke
the blues or gospel or whatever
the service of an eclectic,
post-modern composition. It
plays the blues or gospel or

whatever, the whole nine yards.

This is made possible by the
members’ diverse backgrounds.
Bowie came up through the music
of religious meetings and later
played blues with the likes of
Albert King.

Roscoe Mitchell played alto sax
in the Army band before joining

Ralph Lemon: contemporary dance coreographer

By Jessica Lowenadler
Staff Writer

Body parts ﬂung wildly, human
crabs and cowboys. This furious
allegro of movements created by
The Ralph Lemon Company elicits
the raw and tantalizing talent to

Ralph Lemon is the

style of dance-theater, an
interesting collaboration of
narration, music, design and
dance.

Lemon is known for his
originality and charismatic
choreography. The dancers’
movements, sometimes unnerving
and sometimes frantic, are always
clear and coherent. He expertly
intertwines abstract movement
with material and ideas in which
he allows his dancers to
experiment. “IThe dance] is
evolving. Always. That’s how it
stays fresh."

In addition to his interest in
motion, Lemon is also a very
musical choreographer, taking
special interest in the staggered
link between music and
movement. “His choreography

lumbs to the innermost core of
tne music without mimicking its
surface in obvious or literal ways,”
said The Washington Post.

Happy Trails and Sleep are the
two works which The Ralph
Lemon Company will bring to
Pittsburgh. The distance in style
between the two are excellent
examples of Lemon’s range.
Happy Trails is hardly your usual
western spectacle; however, the
country music, bar stools and
saddles compliment the image of
the West. Moving to new-wave

cowboy music, the performers
discover pain, anger and love.
Sleep is performed to Faure’s
Requiem in an exploration of
spirituality, tranquility and
intimacy. The music provides a

dark, troubled contrast with the
light beauty of its composition.
The dancers provoke this feeling
by beginning with fluid, soft
movements which develop into
an agonizing repetition of painful
gestures.

‘‘It’s a distinctive and self—
consistent mix delivered with such
compelling authority and
conviction by Lemon and his
remarkable bank of performers,
that it burns itself into memory,”
said The Washington Post.

The Ralph Lemon Company
will be performing at The Eddy

Although Blood Relations
explores the murderous mind of
the infamous Lizzie Borden of
1892, it still has the power to
make people in contemporary
audiences think about their own
inner fate and mind.

The play, presented by the
University of Pittsburgh's Studio
Theatre, bounces between the
time before and after the murders,
during 1892 and 1902, in Fall
River, Mass.

The plot centers around the
question, “Did you, Lizzie? Lizzie,
did you?" Every one of the
characters in the play has to either
directly or indirectly find the
answer since Lizzie herself was
never convicted of the crime.

5”’:

Information on Pitt's Study Abroa «

The jury was unable to ﬁlter
through the ambiguities of the
case, and Lizzie has never
presented anyone with the truth.
Although the plot itself has a
few holes, the play, under the
direction of Sharon Pollock, flows
almost ﬂawlessly. Every character
is realistically portrayed, and the
ensemble is one to be praised.
The best and somewhat
frightening aspect of the
production is how it forces the
members of the audience to
contemplate what they would do
under the same circumstances.
Anne Louise Bannon, who
played Lizzie Borden, did a
remarkable job fluctuating
between her many deep-rooted
emotions and thoughts. She easily
transformed herself from having
an appearance of a hard, sinful

woman to a young, confused
little girl. Through the use of her
different intense levels of
characterization, she was able to
evoke catharsis out of the
audience.

Hazel Carr Leroy, the maid, ,.

and Miss Lizzie during the “dream
thesis,” was one of the strongest
characters of the play. This very
talented actress not only had to
deal with minor characterization
effects such as changing to an
Irish dialect as she switched
characters, but also had to create
totally different moods. Her total
concentration on her facial
expressions and actions made
the intensity of the play move to
its highest extent.

Jenny Noa, who played Lizzie’s
sister Emma, successfully
portrayed the obedient little
daughter. She was a perfect
character foil of Lizzie on the
outside, but from time to time
showed similar inner traits. She
represented the rest of us who
hide our inner feelings in order to
please others. She was simple yet
still somewhat complex.

Sara Jane Flemming as Mrs.
Borden was good at coming
across as an old, hard stepmother.
She had an evil eye that really
played up her stepmother attitude.
Even though her acting at times
was somewhat melodramatic, it
generally did not take much away
from her character. I

Red Temple Spirits, The Young Gods & Holy Cow

By Mike Kegg
For The Pitt News

Imagine amusical journey into
the far reaches of your soul. You
become a psychic explorer of the
inner self; a metaphysical pioneer.
Swirling images of distant lands
and mystical creatures, ancient
philosophies and exotic beings;
you are transported into an
existence where dreams become
reality: the magical realm of Los
Angeles-based Red Temple
Spirits.

Over the past 10 years, Los
Angeles has contributed most
significantly to the art-rock scene
in this country. We have
witnessed the numerous
incarnations and eventual break-
up of tribal—rock gods Savage
Republic; the break-up of
Psi—Com, whose lead singer then
found fame withJane’s Addiction;
the addition of Ethyl Meatplow
into Fourwaycross; and the
emergence of Nate Starkman and
Son, the record label which
somehow manages to keep all of
this straight. '

Red Temple Spirits also play a
major role in this network and
with the release of their latest
recording, “If Tomorrow I Were
Leaving fo Lhasa, I Wouldn’t Stay
a Minute More,” they have
become one of the most powerful
art-rock bands to emerge from
the Los Angeles area.

“In the wild hills, the spirits
never stop/ But the willow weeps,
Oh mother hear us/The
mountains once spoke as loud as
thunder/We can hear them still/
beneath the whore god Mamon... ”

The lyrics speak of far—off lands,
of a time when magic drew its
strength from the mother earth.
You become entangled within
these melodies, and are swept
away by a force which builds up
into a maddened frenzy, then

dissipates like melting snow.

A great deal of the lyrical content
is contemplative of nature,
questioning moral issues such as
the state of the world, religious
doctrines, energy needs or
physical yearning (desire). When
1istening_to the record, you can’t
help but notice a slight inﬂuence
from Pink Floyd (circa Piper at
the Gates of Dawn), which may
explain the cover of Roger Waters’

composition “Set the Controls
for the Heart of the Sun” and
“The Nile Song” (which appeared
on their previous record Dancing
to Restore an Eclipsed Moon).

Red Temple Spirits produce an
ambient atmosphere of optimism
which radiates from the music
and is absorbed by your
consciousness.

It is a visual musical form; as a

song progresses, you're guided
along and enlightened with scenes
of splendor that only your
imagination can generate.

The passion of each
composition takes your breath
away. You're left with an
uncontrollable yearning, satiated
only by listening again.

William Faircloth, Dino Paredes,
Thomas Pierik and Spartucus

Taylor are expressing pure
emotion through this recording.
They provide the listener with a
psychic map of their souls, a
journey through the self to obtain
mental liberation.

Red Temple Spirits will be in
Pittsburgh this evening, opening
forHoly Cow and The Young Gods
at the Upstage Lounge in Oakland
for an 8 p.m. performance.

Borden

Continued from page 4
Mr. Bordon, was one of the best

older actors in his portrayal of a
father; he was deﬁnitely one of
the most believable. He presented
both sides of a father during that
time period. He was both strong
and weak. He was strong in that
he stood up for what he believed
in, but weak in that he melted
under the direction of his wife at
times. It was easy to see his true
compassion for Lizzie underneath
his hard exterior.

David Skeele, who played the

Jerry Scott played both the
Defense and Dr. Patrick. Although
he had to jump from each
character, he did so without losing
either one of their effects. He also
did well in retaining his Irish
dialect throughout the play.

As far as the technical aspects
of the play, almost everything
seemed to be in its place. The
stage was perfect for the time
period and was arranged for easy
view from the entire audience.
The lighting was effective in
creating the time-switching
sequences. The costumes were
especially appropriate, but the
make-up, however, needed a little
work. Some characters appeared
too washed out, while others
appeared too made-up, especially
Mrs. Borden.

delight to watch. He looked and
acted well for his part in that he
realistically portrayed a slimy,
good-for-nothing guy. He wanted
everything at any cost. He put on
a variety of movements and
expressions and created different
emotions. He was everything from
cocky to nervous and gave the
audience something new every
time he stepped on stage.

on both continents as jazz masters.
The AACM is now based in New
York City. The Art Ensemble’s
members have had equal, and often
greater, success in the meantime
with dozens of other groups.

Most importantly, at least one
generation of younger musicians
has had the benefit of coming up
with the inspiration of the AACM’s
self-organization, community spirit
and stubbornly relentless agenda of
creative work.

Despite their hard work and
dedication, they felt they were
getting nowhere in a climate
characterized on the one hand
by racism and violence and on
the other by stony indifference.

In the late spring of 1969,
the Art Ensemble and fellow
AACM-member Anthony
Braxton made the journey to
Paris. They weren’t met with
instant success, but they were
finally able to work on a

one to Pittsburghers. The conditions
that made them leave were no doubt
real, but looking back now, the
simple fact of the AACM’s existence
there makes the Chicago of the mid
and late ’60s look to us like a creative
hothouse.

The Pittsburgh New Music
Ensemble in the same way continues,
year by year, to increase its popularity
and expand its musical horizons in
a city where many natives
inexplicably continue to insist that
nothing’s happening.

They made a dozen records
and toured Europe in the
following years, but it wasn't
until 1972 that they were
allowed to make their first
U.S.-festival appearance inAnn
Arbor, Mich. Subsequently, the
concert was released on
Atlantic Records, marking its
first domestic release since
their small—label recordings of
1967 and ’68.

Since then, it’s been a slow
climb to their present status

summoned to serve the earth as
a musical messenger.

The above-mentioned four,
along with Abrams, the late bassist
Charles Clark and many others,
founded and ran the Association
for the Advancement of Creative
Musicians in the early ’60s. The
AACM was primarily a support
group for the musicians, working
to provide performance space
and promote concerts.

They also ran a music school
for south-side ghetto youths.
