The veil of mystery is soon to be
lifted, and the new chancellor will be
revealed — that is, if all goes accord-

» ing to plan.

The search has been narrowed
down to three candidates. All three are
either sitting university presidents or
hold leadership positions in higher
education, according’ to James
Roddey, the head of thejsearch com-
mittee and Board of Trustees member.

. The next Board of Trustees meet-
ingwill be held on June 20. All ﬁnal
decisions on the chancellor selection
must be made by the board. There is
no defmite ‘timetable for the selection

.of.a ﬁnalist. Will a new chancellor be
chosen on the 20th? I I I
__ “I would hope so,” Roddey said.

I - “Ildonff-know that we  make"

ﬂ1at.'?e§mnnunent.”.

I  The candidate ‘ﬁeld was narrowed :

fr.’-I ‘- —

on Friday we will [make a recommen-
dation to the board of trustees]. Right

_ now, I don’t think we could unquali-

fiedly say we’ve taken into account
everything,” said Herbert Chesler, a
member of the search connnittee.

The final candidate will be
brought to campus for interviews with
various groups on Thursday. Late this
week, the committee will meet again
and possibly make a recommendation
to the Board of Trustees. All the can-
didates have received a copy of “The
University of Pittsburgh Review,”
which is the bound copy of the report
on Pitt that was released last spring.
The candidates have been meeting
with various members of the universi-
ty community, including student
groups.

' The only students groups that

" have thus far been involved are the

Student Govemment Board and the
Black Action Society, SGB President

* 'Andy‘Wuerte_1e said that only he and

the ‘president of the Black ‘-Action
Society, Janera Solomon, were meet-
ing with the finalists. Solomon could

committee since last September.
Margo Brown was selected by a panel
of students composed of students
from the SGB, the BAS, The Pitt
News, Nursing,’ Engineering,
Pharmacy, Panhel, and the IFC,
Wuertele said.

. “I feel very comfortable with how
much involvement the student govem—
ment office and undergraduates have
had in the process,” Wuertele said.

All the names have been kept
secret at the ‘candidates’ requests.
None of the candidates will make a
public presentation in order to protect
their anonymity.

“If the candidates’ names are
being kept secret, it is not so much to
keep it secret on this campus as it is to
keep it from being disclosed at the
home institution for fear of putting in
jeopardy the job at the home institu-
tion,” Chesler said. _

The secrecy has been disparaged
by some people. At Monday’s Senate
Council meeting, Mark Ginsburg
‘asked,”If the candidates are anony-
mous at their own campus, how was
deep information gathered from those
campuses?”

Volunteers prep walkers for the Second Annual Pittsburgh AIDS Walk.

Nicole Kuhn
For the Pitt News

By the year 2000, everyone in
America will personally know
someone who has died of AIDS or
someone who has HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, according to the
HIV Early Intervention Services
pamphlet.

On Sunday, 3000 Pitt students
and community members sweated
five miles through the winding
streets and suburbs of Pittsburgh
and raised $250,000 to help prevent
the spread of AIDS. ' A

Participants in the second annu-
al Pittsburgh AIDS Walk could be
seen returning from their journey
through Oakland, Squirrel Hill, and
Shadyside, some carrying balloons

with the red ribbon emblem and oth-
ers carrying their dogs.

“I wanted to show my support
for the cause,” Jessica Baker, a Pitt
student, said. “I walked in remem-
brance of my friend’s brother who
died of AIDS in the hope that other
people won’t have to go through the
same ordeal.”

The Walk was sponsored by
Lazarus, _the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center, Smith,
Klein and Beecham, and Marc
Advertising. There were teams of
walkers from various institutions,
such as members of Pitt’s School of
Nursing, and commercial organiza-
tions like the Gap, in addition to
many families, couples and friends.
Most participants not only did the
actual walking to show their sup-

port, but also took monetary
pledges.

These pledges will be used by
the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force for
education for safer sex, for their
clients in need of money, and for
grants they give to other AIDS orga-
nizations. Ten percent of the money
raised will go toward these grants.

“On behalf of the Task Force,
they were very overwhelmed by the
community spirit and proud of
everyone for working so hard
toward a higher awareness of
AIDS,” Michelle Pagano of the

0 AIDS Task Force said.

Upon their return to Flagstaff
Hill in Schenley Park, shouts of
accomplishment rang out. Walkers
embraced. The hill quickly became
a resting place for exhausted partici-
pants who sat and talked with one
another while replenishing them-
selves with the fruit and water pro-
vided.

“Not only was the gay/lesbian/
bisexual community represented,
but there were lots of people from
the heterosexual community there as
well, showing that AIDS isn’t just a
‘queer’ disease, but can strike some-
one from any walk of life,” Erik
Rueter, a Squirrel Hill resident, said.

Walkers and other supporters
visited the various colorful stands
set up by organizations, such as the
Gay and Lesbian Organization of
Pittsburgh, that promoted safe sex
and offered literature about the
AIDS virus, prevention and testing.
There was also a steel band that
played on the hill as well as a gospel
choir, inspiring some of the partici-
pants to dance.

Pitt students’ hopes of quick
subway treks aroimd the city have
been Stalled

The Port Authority of
Allegheny County’s new Board of
Directors recently took a look at
future projects that were being
considered by the bussing compa-
ny..Among these were the pro-
posed Spine Line project which
could include the expansion of
PAT’s ‘T’ system to Oakland and
the North Side of Pittsburgh.

The Board is taking another
look at these projects to create a
comprehensive, long term public
transportation investment strategy,
according to Judi McNeil,
spokesperson for PAT.

“We wanted to step back and
take a look at the region to see
how we can best serve it,” McNeil
said

However, when they took a
look at the Spine Line project’s
$1.4, billion cost and the uncertain-
ties about the economic develop-
ment generators it is meant to‘
serve, they decided to discontinue
the study while they determine if it
is feasible. Spine Line has been
put on hold. ,

To date, government ﬁmding
has been provided only for the
study into the feasibility of con-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 12, 1996

PAT’s spineline project
stalled by directors

structing the proposed Spine Line.
No fimding for the ﬁnal engineer-
ing or construction of Spine Line
has been allocated.

The Board members have
decided that rather than focusing
on one conidor, they will begin a
process to develop a long term
public transit vision for Allegheny
County. They will assess the cur-
rent and future economic activities
of Allegheny County and, in con-
junction with the Allegheny
County Department of Economic
Development, determine how a
comprehensive public transit net-
work can support an economic
development strategy for
Allegheny County.

“We’re going to look at other
ways to better serve the Oakland
community that may not be as
costly, but still as eifective,” said
McNeil.

She saidthatthe PAT Boardis
interested in working with neigh-
boring counties to ensure that the
investment in public transit in
Allegheny County maximizes
economic development opportuni-
ties throughout the region.

According to McNeil, the
PAT Board will seek public and
community input into the develop-
ment of a comprehensive public
transit plan which will beneﬁt the
residents of Allegheny County and
enhance the economic growth of
the entire region.

New Austrian Room links
IOCCII and global communities

Anne Estonilo
For The Pitt News

The Austrian Nationality
Room, 17 years in the planning, was
formally dedicated in a ceremony on
Sunday in the Heinz Chapel. With
nearly 500 people in attendance,
Helmut Tuerk, the ambassador of
Austria to the United States, gave the
keynote speech.

The room cost about $300,000
to build and is the 24th nationality
room in the Cathedral of Learning. Dr.
Burkart Holzner, director of the
University Center for International
Studies, called the nationality rooms
“the bridge between the university and
community and the community and the
world.”

Today Pitt is the only school in
the country to receive over,25 scholar-
ships a year from ethnic groups helpin
students to study abroad. A

The Austrian Room depicts the
reign of Empress Maria Theresa (b.
l717— d. 1780). Throughout the peri-
od, Austrian art, architecture, music,
and literature was considered among
Europe’s finest. The prototype for the
room is the Haydnsaal (Haydn Hall) in
Schloss Esterhazy, a castle near Vienna.

Carved in stone above the
entrance is the Hapsburg Eagle. The
Hapsburg family ruled from 1278-
1918 AD, producing 20 emperors and
kings and drastically increasing both
the size and power of Austria. The two-
headed eagle symbolizes this growth.
The heads point tothe east and west to
demonstrate the size of the empire. In
its talons, the eagle holds both a sword
and a crown. The sword stands for the
maintenance of autonomy within the
empire and the crown for the rule of the
Hapsburgs. ' _

The dominant features of the
room are its three ceiling murals,
drawn directly from the work of

Oakland Merchants
raise $27, 000 for Cecil

The immediate reaction of
local people when told about
Kevin Cecil is “What can I do
to help?” said Chris Monti, 6
vice president of Oakland
Business and Civic
Association.

Some $28,000 of help was
raised on May 23 through a
golf benefit organized by
Monti and others in the
Oakland Merchants
Association, including busi-
nesses, private citizens, and
the university, all of whom
donated merchandise or ser-
vices which enabled the event
to be such a success.

Monti, who owns the
“Touch of Gold” jewelry store
on Forbes Avenue, said that
the beneﬁt was the kickoff for
other fundraising efforts, such
as making the Kevin Cecil
Fund a beneficiary of the

“Change for the Better” cam-
paign this year.

Cecil, a Pitt student, was
walking a friend home last
July when he was shot and
paralyzed by a 13-year old
whose trial in Allegheny
Common Pleas Court begins
June 27. Cecil will to return to
school to finish his engineer-
ing degree; the fund was set up
to provide for his continuing
care and special equipment.
The special van that was the
fund's original goal has been
ordered and is due to arrive
any day.

Trustees

committee.

“I can’t imagine the student
affairs committee without student
participation,” Wuertele said.

Wuertele and two other stu-
dents inﬂuenced a policy brought
up earlier this year through their
participation on the student atfairs
committee. The committee
approved a waiver of the student
health services fee for School of
Medicine students, but letters from
the student members of the com-
mittee about the unfaimess of this
waiver to the general student body
caused other members to reconsid-
er.

Wuertele and the presidents of
other student governance groups

~ will meet with Connolly Monday

morning to discuss the recommen-
dation.

At its regular meeting
Monday, the Senate Council
approved a resolution that
McDuffie will pass on to
Connolly.

“Whatwe’retryingtodoisto
send a message to the trustees that
we think it’s important for stu-
dents, faculty, and staff to be on
these committees in order to main-
tain communication,” McDuff1e
said. '

e It’s not yet clear how many
trustees support the recommenda-
tion. James Roddey, chair of the
search. committee for the new
chancellor, says the measure might
be appropriate for some commit-
tees and inappropriate for others.

While academic and student
atfairs committees should include
faculty members and students,
other committee atfairs shouldn’t
be delegated to people outside of

' the board, Roddey said.

“I’m not sure it’s appropriate
on the ﬁnance committee or the
nominating committee,’-’ Roddey
said. “I think those are areas of
policy that the board should have
full responsibility for. That’s what
trustees are there for.

  Opinions 7 Editorial

Those who live in glass houses...

The Board of Trustees is considering removing all facul-

‘ ty, staff, and students from its committees.

J. W. Connolly says that the Board is following the rec-
ommendations of “The University of Pittsburgh Review,”
otherwise known as the “Fisher report,” which suggested this
action. The report was commissioned by the Board of
Trustees last spring. The report says that having faculty, staff,
and students on the committees encourages people to bypass
the chancellor and go directly to the Board of Trustees. This,
the report says, undercuts the chancellor’s authority.

Access to The Board of Trustees meetings is already lim-
ited, and the role of the Board is already far removed from
the students. This is not what the University needs.

If the Board wants to enact the recommendations from
the Fisher report, it ought to take care of the recommenda-
tions that pertain to itself.

On page 102, the report says: “The University’s most
pressing need is to restructure, reorganize, deﬁne responsibil-
ity for, and continue to recruit a strong Board of Trustees.
Until that task is undertaken successfully, the appointment of
a new Chancellor and allthe many other changes needed at
the University of Pittsburgh are apt to be marginalized or fail.
The Board of Trustees has not taken responsibility for the
fund—raising performance of the institution. It appears to have
not only delegated that responsibility, but to abrogated its
obligation to support the institution ﬁnancially. The percent-
age of trustees giving to Pitt at all is woefully inadequate,
and the average giving of those who do so is poor. Pitt
trustees should admonish each other to ‘Give, get, or get
off.”’ ‘ '

Further, it says that “The ﬁfty member Board of Trustees
should be reduced in size.”

Reducing the number of faculty, staff, and students on the

Board committees will not help these goals. It is important to '

ensure that the Board remain open and responsive to these

groups of people. These are the ones whom Pitt is designed .

to serve. _

What the Board risks by excluding these groups is the
loss of valuable input, which could result in poor decision
making. The huge body of expertise of the people who are at
Pitt is a resource not to be ignored. In doing so, the Board
risks having its vision institutionalized. '

Instead of having an open decision making process, the
Board will be trapped by its inherently limited information
and ability of those on the Board. Although the Board mem-
bers may be very capable in their respective ﬁelds, they are
not necessarily Renaissance men who have mastered all
trades. In addition, since their decisions affect the students to
such a great degree, the Board ought to have the ability to
easily access the best experts on the student population, and
that is the students themselves.

“But there comes a time when
a father and his son/Can no longer
be one. ”
— Gino Vannelli, “Fatherand Son”

I don’t think my father ever
really learnedthatlesson.

And as Father’s Day
approaches, I remember that it’s
possible for a father to hold onto his
children so tightly they have no
room to grow.

That’s why I’m still in school
atthe ageof35 —— andalsowhy
my father isn’t around anymore.

Now, I don’t want to turn this
column into something like
“Daddy Dearest,” telling anyone
and everyone just how rotten he
treated me growing up, especially
since he’s gone now and can’t
answer. But the truth is, he does
share the responsibility for what
I’ve become. And not necessarily
in a positive sense, either.

When I consider his history, I
can’tbetoohardonhim.Dadhad
grown up poor and fatherless on
the Hill (his parents divorced in a
time when that just wasn’t done),
and I think his mother wanted to
tum him into the husband she lost.
Well, Dad wouldn’t go for that —
after a term or so at Duquesne
University, he went into the Army
for a few years and later played
football at a small black college in
North Carolina.

His senior year there, he met
my mother, a freshman; they
eloped to New York City after her
sophomore year, and he reunned to

allow children to grow up

Pittsburgh to work. Mom followed
after she finished, and the next
spring I came along. Fifteen
months later, I had a brother.
Anyway, I grew up in a two-
bedroom house in Pittsburgh’s East
End. We led a comfortable life, and
in addition to his day job as a
teacher in the city schools, he also
moonlighted as a jazz bass player
—- indeed, on a few occasions we
had family jam sessions (I would
play piano; my brother, the drums).
I’m sure Dad was thinking that if
he could have frozen this scene for-
ever he would have been happy.
However, people do change
and grow and don’t always do and
think what you may want them to. I
think that scared him, at least when
it came to me, whom many at that
time considered a genius. He was
also an insanely jealous alcoholic
who never dealt with his own anger
toward what he saw as an unjust
world —- and it would only be a
matter of time before he took it out
onme.TothisdayIswearthathis
mission in life was to humiliate me.
Dad sabotaged both our athlet-
ic careers in part by arguing with
coaches (who wants to coach a kid
with meddling parents?), and I’m
sure that had to do with other adults
relating to us. It especially hurt my
brother, who had could have
played major college basketball.
My favorite sport was baseball -
but he let me know I was “stupi ”
for liking that sport.
Inmyteens,Iwas expectedto
date but not supposed to drive a car.
But the neighborhood girls didn’t
like me, and I couldn’t get to the
ones that did, and there was sorne—
thing wrong with me because I
couldrr’t get dates When I eventu-
ally did get a girl, he was upset.
When I was around 15 , I

‘decided to start writing Letters to

the Editor — Dad demanded to see
everything I wrote. Once, when I
was 19, I put in something he
didn’t like, and he threatened to
throw me out of the house!
Apparently I wasn’t supposed to
express any opinion other than his.
And career plans — well, he

wanted me to obtain a chemical
engineering degree from Carnegie
Mellon University and do it at
home (Never mind that I was terri-
ble in math and science and ended
up ﬂunking out of two schools.).
He said about my true talent, “It’s
okay if you want to write on the
side, but thats not where your
career’s gonna be.”

By my junior year in high
school, my‘ parents’ marriage was
failing, and Mom ﬁnally walked
out ﬁve years later. Dad then said to
my brother and me, “There are
going to be some changes around
here.” I didn’t intend to ﬁnd out
what, so Mom wisely invited me to
live with her. Then, my brother
married.

Dad was all alone.

‘He resented us for that. He
called my mother dirty names, and
to his dying day I don’t think he
accepted my brother’s other family.
I tried to maintain some type of
relationship with him until 1988,
when I encountered him one night
at a James Moody concert I was
attending with my mother and her
new husband. He said, coldly, “Did
you come with your father?”

From that point on, I waited
forhimtodie.Threeyears agothis
August, I saw him at a family wed-
ding. He looked very bad — old,
shuffling, brain probably pickled
fromallhisdrinking.We were civil
(ﬂiank you, Lord) and he asked me
what I wanted to do musically; I
said I didn’t know. I remember
ﬂiinking,“’Ihis maybethelasttime
you see your father.” I was right.

ByDec.2,hewasdeadof_a
stroke.

Sadly, Dad never knew or
cared who I was, what I stood for.
He likely never knew that I wrote a
column for The PittNews (my third
piece ran the day of his frmeral),
and he won’t see my future tri-
urnphs.

All because I wouldn’t stay a
little boy.

And thats what hmts the most.

The WWF

adjusts our,

annude,
can you
dig it?

"Columnist
Matt
Grove

he City of Pittsburgh
| has been dubbed
many things over the
past few years, including
the nation’s Most Livable
City in the early 1990s.
Since then the Pirates,
Steelers, and Penguins
have squandered away
chances of bringing home
the championships in their
respective sports. This has
really gotten the inhabi-
tants of the Steel City
down in recent years. I
guess that is why the World
Wrestling Federation has
recently announced that
Pittsburgh needs what they
call an attitude adjustment.
Yes, that’s right; the easy-
going yinzers that make up
Pittsburgh need put in their
place. It’s extremely gener-

ous of the WWF to concem_

themselves so much with
those of us in the Burgh
that have an attitude prob-
lem. What could be done to
solve this problem?

How about cleaning up
the steel mills that died in
the early 803? Well, that
would be great for the
workers who were laid off
and for those who are hav-
ing difficulty finding jobs,
but would that move be

I "strong enough to adjust the

entire collective attitude of
the city? .

Maybe Pittsburgh could
try bringing in riverboat
gambling. Huge, gaudy,
ﬂashing boats clogging up
already filthy waterways
downtown and around
Three Rivers Stadium. This
could be a reality for
Pittsburgh sooner than you
think, but that’s still a little
bit too far down the line.
This city needs something
now.

Mark Sunday,- June 30 on
your calendars because that
is the day when life will be
pumped back into

Pittsburgh, and all those

who worried about the
city’s slow death will be
struck by a force harder
than an atomic drop, more
vicious than the Honky
Tonk Shufﬂe. Oh yeah, the
WWF is back, and they’re
not taking any more excus-
es from the people of
Pittsburgh.

Former Pitt assistant Calipari lands Nets job

Matt Grove
Assistant Sports Editor

Making the jump from college to
the NBA is not only a big move for

’ players, but for coaches as well. John

Calipari, Moon High School grad and
former Pitt assistant under Paul
Evans, made that move last week
when he signed a 5-year, $15 million
deal with the New ‘Jersey Nets to
become head coach and executive vice
president of basketball operations for
the struggling franchise.

“I’m excited about this opportuni-
ty,” Calipari said. “I wanted to coach
the Nets. This is a job that I did
want.” \

Calipari, who led UMass to a 35-2

record and a Final Four berth last sea-

son before falling to eventual
National Champion Kentucky,
replaces Butch Beard, who the Nets
fired following the 1995-1996 season.
Beard coached in New Jersey for two
years,'each year ending with a 30-52
record.

With the NBA draft less than a
month away, the Nets were eager to
have a coach in position to help solid-
ify their selections. New Jersey had
offered Kentucky head coach Rick
Pitino a 5-year deal worth upwards of
$30 million that included a 10 percent
ownership of the team. Although
Pitino declined the offer, he did rec-
ommend a few coaches to the Nets,
including his good friend Calipari and
Pitt head coach Ralph Willard. A few

sources said that the Nets were very
interested in Willard but were not
confident enough that his name could
sell tickets.

“My goal is to create a love affair
between this organization and the fans
of New Jersey,” Calipari said. “I also
want to thank Rick (Pitino) for not
taking the job.”

Calipari took over the head coach-
ing job at UMass in 1988 and went
193-71 in eight seasons,winning five
straight Atlantic 10 titles as well as
making the 64-team NCAA field five
years in a row.

The 37-year-old Calipari may have
left UMass for his first professional
job at just the right time. Last week,
former UMass star center Marcus
Camby, the national player of the year
last season, admitted to receiving gifts
from agents while attending UMass.
These gifts included over $5,000 in
jewelry, as well as cash payments and
money for friends. Ironically, Calipari
denied reports for weeks prior to
Camby’s news that he had plans to
leave UMass for the NBA.

“If there was something that I
needed to stay and fight, I would have
stayed,” Calipari said, admitting that
he stepped away from the Nets
process when the allegations first
arose. “After a day of looking at it, I
was comfortable that the program
would stay in good shape.”

If these allegations are found to be
true, UMass mayjhave to forfeit all
games they won while Camby was in

uniform and may face probation.
Calipari denies any involvement with
the Camby incident and stands behind
his statement that no players, includ-
ing Camby, ever received extra incen-
tives from the school and that he
knew of no gifts given from agents to
Minutemen players.

In an interview with the New York
Daily News, Calipari said, “It’s an
unbelievable opportunity to build a
championship organization. I have
total control over basketball opera-
tions. How many times can a guy like
me get an opportunity like this?”

’ Calipari will become the 15th
coach since the Nets began operations
as an ABA team in 1967.

UMass wasted little time looking
for a replacement for the man who
rebuilt their basketball program that
struggled since the days of Julius
Erving. Saturday, the school named
assistant coach James “Bruiser” Flint
the new head coach. Flint’s deal is for
four years and will pay him $132,000
annually, the same as Calipari
received with the Minutemen.

Flint guided the Minutemen twice

last season, going 1-1. On January 14,
Camby collapsed prior to a game.

against St. Bonaventure. With
Calipari at Camby’s side in the hospi-
tal, Flint and UMass won 62-52. Flint
wasn’t as successful on February 24,
when, after Calipari was ejected early
in the first half, UMass lost it’s first
game of the year, 86-76, to George
Washington.

Panthers get Ava/anched in finals

Mike Kovak
Sports Editor

The look on Florida Panther goalie
John Vanbiesbrouck’s face after being
pulled before game two’s second period
said everything.

Vanbiesbrouck appeared dazed and
mentally confused after surrendering four
goals on ten first period shots that night,an
8-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche and
after that one period it became evident that
the team which ousted Ray Bourque and
the Boston Bruins, Eric Lindros and the
Philadelphia Flyers, and Mario Lemieux’s
Pittsburgh Penguins would not rebound in
the Stanley Cup Finals.

Last night at Miami Arena, defenseman
Uwe Krupp, who’s season had been in
doubt due to a knee injury on opening
night, of the Avalanche ended months of
incessant Floridian rat throwing with a
slapshot in the third overtime period to
beat the Panthers 1-0, sweeping the
Stanley Cup Finals and giving the city of
Denver its first professional sports cham-
pionship.

Last season, the Avalanche played as
the Quebec Nordiques and were outsted in
the first round of last year’s playoffs by
the New York Rangers.

Avalanche netminder Patrick Roy,
arguably the greatest goalie to ever play in
the postseason, stopped all 63 Panther
shots, including 28 in overtime and several
excellent scoring chances. Florida did
have more scoring chances in game four.
The Beezer made 56 saves for Florida in a
losing effort.

Colorado’s Joe Sakic, an easy choice
for the Conn Smythe Trophy as the play-
off’s’ MVP, finished the playoffs with 18

goals (one short of the record) and 16

assists in 22 games.

What went largely unnoticed in this
series was Florida’s' ability to once again
keep the opposition’s main offensive
weapon from putting the puck in the net.
Sakic, who had 17 goals going into the
finals, managed to put only one shot past
the Florida goalie-I tandem of
Vanbiesbrouck and Mark Fitzpatrick.

However, the Avalanche outplayed
Florida completely. Forechecking, a major
reason for the Panthers’ playoff success,
had little effect on Avalanche frontliners.
Colorado utilized players such as Warren
Rychel and Dave Hannan, not to mention
Peter Forsberg, to constantly beat the
Panthers to loose pucks.

Speaking of Forsberg, the 21-year-old
showed why most hockey aficionados are
beginning to believe that he will be the
next great player in the league. He skated
circles around the vaunted Panther
defense, something Lemieux, Jagr and
Lindros could not do, creatingseveral
scoring opportunities for himself and his
teammates during the entire series.

The Panthers also could not take
advantage of Claude Lemieux’s suspen-

sion. Last year’s Conn Smythe winner with

the New Jersey Devils, sat out the first two
games of the series after a hit on Detriot
Red Wing Chris Draper and scored the
first goal of game three, an exciting 3-2
Avalanche victory. .Lemieux still faces
possible legal action from Draper, who
suffered several severe facial injuries.

If the Colorado Avalanche are able to
remain intact, with the main necessity to
retain Roy, Colorado could be celebrating
with Lord Stanley for the next few years.

Colorado’s sweep marks the third time
in the last five Stanley Cup Finals, the

series has lasted only four games.

in Altoona every few months
when wrestling came to
town. The British Bulldogs
beat Nikolai Volkov and The
Iron Sheik for the tag team
title; Hogan and Rowdy
Roddy Piper exchanged
blows for the pure, unadul-
terated enjoyment of all
9,000 screaming fans. When
the kings of the squared cir-
cle weren’t in our town, all
the kids would wait in line
for tickets to watch
Wrestlemania via satellite.
When those lights dimmed
there was no other energy
stronger than that found
within the confines of that
hallowed arena.

I remember it like yester-
day, the day that made me a
true believer. It was the
spring of 1986 and the WWF
was huge. Hulk Hogan was
the champ and the likes of
Hillbilly Jim, Jake “The
Snake” Roberts, Barry
Windham and Mike Rotunda
(a.k.a The US Express) were
heroes to many. At least they
gave us some pseudonyms to
use when we beat up on peo-
ple or got beat upon.

It was a gorgeous day in

May when my mother beck-
oned me from the driveway
basketball game that
enveloped me at the moment.
She told me that we had to
go out to the gym for a
minute because my stepfa-
ther had someone there that
wanted to meet me. It turns
out that it was all set up for
me to meet this icon and he
really didn’t want to meet
me, but I fell for it nonethe-
less. ' —
As we pulled up to the
gym, I bantered out of the
car and raced into ‘the lobby
only to be stopped in my
tracks by a glorious, domi-
nating presence that is etched
in my mind to this day. It
was “The Macho Man”
Randy Savage and the lovely
Miss Elizabeth, in the ﬂesh.

Savage was in town to
wrestle the following day, an
event for which I had third
row tickets. All the Macho
Man did that day was treat
me to lunch and he gave me
an autographed shirt. That
was more than he had to do
because for some reason I
was in heaven, and it wasn’t
because of the bodacious
presence of Elizabeth“. The
Macho'Man was the first real
superstar I had met, if you
don’t count running into
Smokin’ Joe Frazier at
Denny’s when I was 10.

I came_home that day, and

' for the rest of the week I was

the talk of the neighborhood.
Needless to say, Savage

wouldn’t remember me to.

this day, but I will be think-
ing of him when I nestle into
my ringside seat June 30 at

John Zorn will blowmore than your mind on Saturday

John Zorn’s name usually
evokes either great pleasure, dis-
taste, or blank stares. You love
him, hate him or are totally
unaware of his legacy."Considered
an avant garde-superstar and
champion of New York’s down-

town Knitting Factory scene, Zorn ‘

tends to get panned by skeptics as
a no—talent noise maker. The truth
be told, the alto saxophonist can
do much more than squeal. He has
an amazing tone and stunning

, dexterity on his instrument and his

compositional skills put him in a
class with the likes of John Cage,
Phillip Glass, and Steve Reich. All
this aside, he remains interesting,
exciting, and invariably listenable.
There’s much more to Zorn than
critical intellectualizations and
concepts; ﬂ1ere’s music.

He’s played, recorded, and
written with so many musicians it
would be too laborious to name
them all. The Violent Femmes,
Mr. Bungle, Eye Yarnatsuka, Trrn
Berne, Bill Frissell, Fred Frith,
Marc Ribot, and the Kronos
Quartet are some highlights. Zorn
is thoroughly obsessed with every
form of music from hardcore
punk, jazz, and classical, to every
kind of folk music imaginable.
Those who witnessed his game
piece Cobra two years ago at the
Rodef Shalom saw how he forced

all these fascinations on his group
of musicians in'a full ﬂedged
musical battle. One or more musi-
cians would petition Zom to ﬁght
whichever musicians were in con-
trol of the stage. Zorn would
aclmowledge the request and ﬂash
a card dictating the style of music
the player must use in combat, fre-
quently changing cards and gen-
res. Most were in awe at the fast-
paced, ever—changing composi-
tional premise. Some expecting a
more traditional composition (let
alone Zorn playing his horn) were
a bit disappointed, however. For
those who didn’t appreciate Cobra
or fear over—blown concepts, take
note: Zorn is back; he has his

a horn; he’ll knock your socks off.

The name of his group is
Masada, and it features some of
jazz music’s -brightest: Joey
Barron on drums, Greg Cohen on
bass Dave Douglas on trumpet,
and Zorn on alto sax. As the name
suggests, there is a theme nmning
through. the work. Masada was a
fortress by the Dead Sea where
Jewish zealots took refuge after
their successful ﬁght for‘indepen—
dence against the Syrians. For
three years the Zealots ﬂourished
while the Romans encircled and
eventually tried to take the
fortress. The ﬁghting was intense,
but the Zealots could not match

the man power of the Romans.
The group committed mass sui-
cide, a fate preferable to enslave-
ment. Zorn is one of the rising
stars in the Jewish cultural renais-
sance, and his work pays homage
to his ancestor’s struggle.

The music is a heavily
klezrner (traditional Jewish folk)
based jazz marriage that translates
the history of Masada into sound.
Thematically, the songs range
from exuberant charges to bluesy
dirges. Stylistically, some songs
are klezrner gems, some embrace
the post bop structure of 1960s
Omette Coleman, while most
merge the two with chilling
results. The music is emotionally
charged with beautifully ringing
melodies, and (skeptics take note)
it is accessible. Yes, this music is
very listenable, yet not hackneyed
Zom’s compositions are intelli-

_ gent, and the band’s playing is sec-

ond to none. Be there, or feel
guilty for the rest of your life.

Pittsburgh is privileged to host
such display of talent which will
no doubt be a highlight of the

Over '21 .-

 

Trans Am leads the Casio Revolution

The electronic revolution has
begun. Again.

Actually, keyboard-friendly
music never left; it’s just gotten
much better, both qualitatively

and stylistically. Forget the melo- ’

dramatic riﬁs of arena rock bands
— these groups would have
sucked anyway, even without
synth. -
Giving Casios a bad name,
Top 40 ‘80s bands endangered the
reputation of all things electronic,
burying the capabilities of synthe-
sizers and other sound-scraping
instruments under layers of clich-
es. Innovative technology was
used to manufacture cheese pop,
as the goodness of New Wave and
its super-futuristic appeal
drowned in a sea of over-pro-
duced rock music embarrassing to
listen to for everyone except the
motorheads and mallrats who
made “Slippery When Wet” sep-
tuple platinum.

Fortunately, the stigma of
such masturbatory snoozak has
ebbed, giving way to an array of
intelligent, interesting bands who
use electronic instruments to. their
own benefit. Groups like
Stereolab and Trans Am destroy
the somewhat popular notion that
good music is only generated
ﬁom Fenders and Marshall stacks.

So why are so many bands
dragging their middle school-
dated Casios out of the basement
and into the studio (same differ-
ence)? Well, my guess is that peo-
ple are bored with the traditional
band formula. True, many great
songs are still being created from

“two guitars+bass+drums,”
explicitly illustrated last Thursday
night by the “pure pop genius”
(quoth the Trbovich, evermore) of
Guided by Voices. I

It is exciting to note that key-
boards and other scientiﬁcally-
inspired instruments are becom-
ing increasingly commonplace
these days, Applied successfully,
these instruments add a progres-
sive element that enhances, not
detracts, from music’s enjoyabili—
ty. Titled everything from “math
music” to “postrock,” synth-
spawned music has gained many
fans who until recently would
have termed “keyboard” a dirty
word. .

Nowadays, it’s not hard to
find someone who can insert
“Moog” into a sentence without

stumbling over their words. Moog

is a family of synthesizers named
after scientist and instrument
manufacturer Robert Moog, who
designed keyboards for a living
after receiving a doctorate in
physics in 1963.

Dedicated to improving the 9

functional quality of electronic
keyboards, Moog ﬁrst created a
do-it-yourself transistorized
theremin. Therernins are magnetic
ﬁeld alternators played by waving
one’s hands between two anten-
nae — one for pitch, the other for
volume. (Rent the documentary
“Theremin: The Electronic
Odyssey” and watch ex-Beach
Boy Brian Wilson go krrazy.)
Realizing a need for
improved electronic instruments,
in 1964 Moog and composer

Henry Deutsch decided to explore .

various forms of electronic cir-
cuitry. By 1964, Moog had his
very ﬁrst prototype for ﬂie “mod-
em” Moog.

Through the use of controlled
generators and ﬁlters, the Moog
synthesizer allows the performer
to create her own sounds by con-
necting modules with electric
wires and by, uh, turning knobs.
Today, the most popular member
of the Moog family is the
Minimoog, featured prominently
as one of the main ingredients on
“The Moog Cookbook,” a new
compilation on Restless Records.

While its kitsch cutsiness is
hard to swallow, the “Cookbool€’
provides a valuable resource for
experiencing the varied sounds of
the electronic universe. Keyboard
magicians Meco Eno and Uli

. Nomi use Minimoogs, Hammond

and Farfisa organs, and many
models of the Roland series of
synthesizers to produce ten elec-
tro—covers of altema-rock super-
hits. Bad music, but it sounds
kinda neat.

On the other hand, “Emperor
Tomato Ketchup,” Stereo1ab’s lat-
est release, is an overﬂow of mas-
terful keyboard craft. The stun-
ning_sounds produced by the ‘lab
is created by the band’s quartet of
organs juxtaposed against the
lovely voice of Laetitia Sadier.
With Voxorgans, Wurlitzer elec-
tric pianos, Moogs and Farﬁsas,
Stereolab make fierce French

I ShotAndy Warhol
Directed by Mary Harron
W:Mary Harron, Daniel

Minahan
Starring Lili Taylor,
Stephen Dorff, Jared Harris

Essentially, I Shot Andy
Warhol is an intricate charac-
ter study of Valarie Solanas,

the lesbian feminist who was
the founder and sole member
of SCUM (Society for Cutting
Up Men) and the woman that
shot Andy Warhol in 1968.
Although the ﬁlm touches on
the fringe world of Warhol

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 12, 1996

and his Factory, the primary
focus of the film rests on
Solanas (Lili Taylor) and her
deterioration in a society
infested with “men, married
women, and other degener-
ates.”

Although we are invited
to explore Solanas’ theories
about the male dominated
society in which she found
herself, I had difficulty
accepting her motivations for
the apparent radical transfor-
mation from lesbian feminist
to lesbian extremist. Solanas’
theories wentfrom being
intriguing and stimulating in
thought tooutright psychotic
without much premise.
Despite the fact that she was
forced to prostitute herself and
become the victim of a male
dominated atmosphere, the
end that the ﬁlm came to was
not foreseen, since the events
the portrays ﬁlm did not moti-
vate Solanas to her final
actions. ‘

Initially, writer/director
Mary Harron intended the

ﬁlm to follow a documentary

format, but the producers con-
vinced her to create a dramat-
ic interpretation of the story.
The result is an independent
film which is stylistic, yet
lacks the narrative elements
essential for effective story-
telling. Many of the scenes
with overloaded exposition
would have worked better if
the ﬁlm was in fact told as a
documentary. For instance, in
the ﬁlm’s opening, a psychol-
ogist’s voice-over presents a
series of misplaced ﬂashbacks
that give Solanas’ biographi-
cal background. Traumatic

. childhood experiences such as

her fatl1er’s sexual abuse are
mentioned but are never

developed. There was a simi-
lar problem with many other
elements presented in the
ﬁlm, and although aspects of
Solanas’ personality were
mentioned, they were never
expanded upon.

However, as the ﬁlm pro-
gresses, we do see Valarie’s
frustrations with the world
intensify. Yet the point of tran-
sition where her intellectual
frustrations become paranoid
delusions is far too undeﬁned,
and therefore, it is difﬁcult to
accept. At one moment, we
are watching a witty, intelli-
gent woman attempting to
cope m a society in which she
feels oppressed, and immedi-
ately we ﬁnd ourselves watch-
ing a violent and paranoid
fanatic trying to kill Warhol, a
man that _ she suddenly
believed had “too much con-
trol” over her.

Although many viewers
may have trouble relating to
Valarie Solanas’ disagreeable
personality, Lili Taylor’s per-
formance captures our atten-
tion throughout the ﬁhn. She
is both relentlessly energetic
and hopelessly angry through-
out the picture, and we do
experience her frustrations
even though we do not clearly
understandall of the motiva-
tions behind them.

Indeed, all of the perfor-
mances in I ShotAndy Warhol
were outstanding, including
Stephen Dorff’s portrayal of
drag queen Candy Darling

, and Jared Harris’ shy, some-
what lost, image of Andy" 

Warhol. I truly cannot
remember the last time I saw
so many memorable charac-

ters in an otherwise forget-

table ﬁlm.

Trans Am

0 from page 9

hseminal synth bands like

Kraftwerk and Devo in a style that
is more precise than quirky and
more pop than dance.

Indeed, synth need not be
destructive to a "band’s street cred-
ibility. When employed tastefully,
it can make music rock even hard-
er than the cheapest distortion
pedal. Well, maybe not harder, but
deﬁnitely more interesting, allow-
ing for ‘greater depth of sound,
ﬂexibility, and fun.

Keeping in tune with the key-
board co1inter—evolution, Trans
Am have developed a schizoid
sound that incorporates keyboard
cool with prog-rock retrospection.
Their songs receive inspiration
ﬁ'om everything on the TV dial,
from nature documentaries to
MTV videomercials.

The Takoma Park, Maryland
trio’s self—titled debut (Thrill
Jockey) is thirty minutes of pre-
cisely-placed jungle beats and
sonic grooves. The opening track,
“Ballbados,” is a synth swagger
with Deep Purple undertones,
while the ambient-ﬂavored instru-
mentals like “American Kooter”
lie somewhere between prog and

 surf.

VV1th so many inﬂuences, it’s
no wonder that Trans Am remains
unclassiﬁable. Self-titled “the rock
band that gets bored with tock
really easily,” they have found
solace and companionship in
Casio synthesizers. Casios feature
pre-programmed rhythms and
demo settings that Trans Am have
utilized to a great extent, but not to
excess.

Always exploring new elec-
tronic topography, the band’s live
shows feature as much improvisa-
tion as composed material, mak-
ing every ‘show a one—time deal.
This Monday, you can catch
Trans Am at the Oakland
Beehive. This time the show is
all-ages, unlike the band’s last
appearance in Pittsburgh, at the
now-defunct venue Cloud 9.
Their performance put many good
words on the tongues of local
rockers, many who had almost
forgotten that Casio is a keyboard,
not a Spanish word. With their
cleverness and quirk, Trans Am
should not disappoint you.

Trans Am will show up at_the
Oakland Beehive Monday, June
17th, at 8 pm. Opening acts are
Yizzy, Meisha, and local heroe
Shale. $6. 1 A ‘

Ploughrnan’s Lunch
Paddy is GotA Brand New Bag
Blue Duck Records

When Ploughman’s
Lunch started out, they were
Pittsburgh’s Pogues, shufﬂing
between the electric guitar and the
bodhran, the sax and the tin whis-
tle in front of mobs of fans drink-
ing Black & Tans around town
and the Pittsburgh area. They
played “Celtic Rock”, and they
played it well. Apparently, they
played it out It may have been the
trials of a six plus member band,
the limitations of a particular style,
or maybe a repulsion at being
called “Pittsburgh’s Pogues,” but
Ploughman’s Lunch has stripped
down its sound to be more, sort of,
-rock, albeit with a Celtic twist

In fact, I’d go a step fur-
ther and say Pub—Rock. Dr.
Feelgood, no, but certainly closer
to the Stranglers than the
Dubliners. Gone from this disc are
the bodhrans and the whistles,
except for a few choice interrup-
tions (the break in the ﬁrst song,
“In Ireland” is a good example).
Still there, however, are the highly
literate lyrics and the dance—ori—
ented energy. Now, instead of
being based in Irish music, the
band molds its inﬂuences, like the
Police did with reggae, around
Rock n’ Roll songs (complete with
capital R’s).

Do you have anorexia or bulimia? i

he Center for Overcoming Problem Eating (COPE) at the

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is seeking women
ages 18 to 35 to participate in a research study. If you are
suffering from anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or have recovered,
you may be eligible to participate in this study. Participants
must be medication-free (birth control pills are acceptable).

Participants will receive payment upon completion of the

study. For more information or to see if you qualify for the

University of Pittsburgh

guitar player, and songwriter Karl
Mullen writes cynically sentimen-
tal songs about the social struggles

P of being an exile, printing the ter-

rors of the Irish diaspora on a
T—shirt like the love/hate relation-
ships of his spiritual forefathers:
Joyce, Van Morrison, Sammy
Beckett and the like. Songs like
“In Ireland” and “Top 0 the
Morning” spit about the stereo-
types and hangups as well as the
wonders and beauties, of the island
that is -one of America’s great
obsessions. The growled vocals
(Tom Waits, y’all?) are backed by
pint-bashing guitars and drums
and mournful R&B saxes.
Paddy's Got A Brand
New Bag was recorded completely
live in the studio, which is a boost
to the pubby songs and to the
Two—Tone styled ska of “Where
Did You Get That Hat?” and the
township jive feel of live—set
favorite “Mandela” (let’s nod
towards the Specials twice). The

downside of the live recording’

experiment is a tendency to lose

‘aspects ofthe band within certain

songs. The beautiful closing song,
“Tilly”, a countryish pop song
with harmonica and great drurn—
ming, is somewhat lost in the mid-
dle when drummer Dennis
Childers’ vocal mike isn’t quite
right. Mullen’s vocals also get
dumped out at times throughout
the disc.

Paddy is a great introduc-
tion to the new four-piece lineup
of Ploughman’s Lunch, featuring
the three remaining original mem-
bers (Childers, Mullen, and sax-
man Don Roehlich) and new bass

 

GOLD CIRCLE SEATS FOR THE

player Rob Jacob. The disc has
some very high points (the stream
of consciousness reminiscing rap
on “In Ireland”, the new rock ver-
sion of “Whiskey From the Field”,

which appeared on their ﬁrst CD
Sodom & Begorrah in a very dif-
ferent vein), and few low points
(the U2ishness of “Bell’s of Hell”).

Paddy also gives a good impres-

11

sion of the band live. I suggest see-
ing them play ﬁrst, maybe with a
few pints down the gullet
