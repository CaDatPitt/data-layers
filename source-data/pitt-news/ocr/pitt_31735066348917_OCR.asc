BY TOM WENSTON

Pitt administrators originally
planned to charge students admis-
sion to Pitt football games this
year, Student Government Board
(SGB) President Larry Platt report-
ed at Monday night’s SGB

. meeting.

“Objections from Platt and other

;; .éGB members, though, prompted

administrators to draw up the
alternate plan of coupon exchange,
Platt said.

“The idea of charging admission
this year was dropped, but it’s
likely admission will be charged
next year.” .

Commuter Association Presiden
Larry Chaban accused Platt of
neglecting to inform student
leaders of the University's ticket
system plans, thus lessening
studentinput in dealing with the
problem. “You (Platt) should have
notified us earlier of the problem,”

“We might have

supporting a policy we don’t like.”

Platt said he was not notiﬁed
about the new plan until the end of
summer, when he was moving back
to campus, and did not have an
immediate opportunity to discuss
‘the matter with student leaders

because of his involvement with
Freshman"Fall Weekend.

“I was vehemently opposed to
the plan from the beginning,” latt
said in defense. “I did all I could to
handle the problem at the time.”

The football ticket plan was not
made public until the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) meeting on September 4.

Under the plan, ticket distribu-

tion for each home game will begin I

eight days before the game and end
the Friday before the game. No
tickets will be available the day of
the game. '

Although 20,000 coupon booklets
will be printed, only 9,200 student
seats will be, available for each
game. Six hundred date tickets for
$7 each, and 500 parent tickets for

$5 each will be available for .

These seats will be
located in Section 11, according to
Bluestein.

‘‘If someone wants to sit with his
date or his parents, he can
exchange his coupon for a seat next
to them when he buys . their
tickets,” Bluestein said.

One of a pair of date tickets will
be stamped. The unstamped ticket
must be presented with ID for

A study of faculty unionization
by a-special committee will include
a student member in a panel
consisting of three pro-union
faculty and three anti-union fac-
ulty, according to a resolution of
the University Sqnate
passed Monday afternoon.

The student member was includ-
ed at the request of Student
Government (SG) President Larry
Platt, who expressed concern that
the study would lack the considera-
tion» of student views.

“What place do students have in
faculty unionization? "I feel a
student should be included in the
special committee and I will
vehemently oppose any motion in
which it would not be included,”
Platt said. ' ,

Senate Council President Frank
Slaughter suggested that student
concerns would be best served in
the larger assembly during ques-
tions from the ﬂoor, and opposed
inclusion of a student on the special
committee. ’

The special committee will‘

compile information on faculty
unionization, with funding from the
research coming from the Univer-
sity administration. A general
assembly will be held in which the
ﬁndings of the committee will be
reported to the full Senate.

Slaughter noted although no
time or date could be set for the
general assembly of faculty, it was
important to begin inquiry so the
information could be of use to
faculty pondering’ a vote on
unionization. V ‘

The resolution for the special
committee was passed, 16-3.

A study of the‘ University
undergraduate advising system is
in the works, aimed at locating
problems and poor policies, ac-
cording to a report by Student
Affairs Committee Chairman Bob
Connamacher.

“A function of our committee is
to see the University’ advising
system is effective and actually
helping the student body,” Conna-
macher said. “We’re going to
concentrate on the undergraduate
and pre-professional advising for
the present.”

 Livewire: Students Attack High Book Prices

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

The Livewire has returned to handle "student gripes
about Pitt‘s»burgeoning bureacracy. The first criticism of
the school year is a natural--the cost of books!

Student complaints over expensive textbooks are
cropping up on campus as another term gets underway.

Several students enrolled in Life Sciences 21 are
dissatisﬁed with the cost of the two required textbooks.
The books are Biology of the Cell by Stephen L. Wolfe and
Cell Biology by Robert Dyson. Each book costs $16.95.
The students feel that the books are just an expensive
duplication of each other.

The two books are required because the course is
team-taught. according to the faculty”staff. The ﬁrst half of

__ ~ the course is run by the biology department under

..§:rofessor Carl Partanen. The second_ half _is handled by the
biochemistry department under professor Richard Abrams.
In reply to the complaints. Partanen said the two books
were essential because each approaches the subject of cell

-‘.__p. .‘ , I.

with the structural aspect while the second half deals with
the biochemical or functional aspect. No one single
textbook around deals with each aspect adequately.”
According to Paranen, the books were the “latest, best
and most adequate for the course.”
It was not. however, the decision of the two professors

involved to choose the books. A committee of six to eight-

faculty members of the life sciences department decided on
the books. _

Abrams reiterated Paranen’s rationale for using the
books. “The emphasesof the two books differ,” he said.
“The second half deals with chemistry and the first with
cellular description.

"Anyone who feels he can adequately get the materials
from other books is.welcomed to," Abrams said. "Pairing
up on textbooks, although a little inconvenient, would be
economically more suitable for the students," he added.

The books in Life Sciences 21 will be used in the
continuation course. Life Sciences 22, according to

requirements of life science majors, so the studentslwill be

‘getting double use of the books.” Abrams said he felt the

two books willbe used with an additional paperback.
Both protessors felt there was no way of getting around
the use of the two books without decreasing the quality of
the materials. -
Why are the books so expensive? Jim Crowley, textbook

buyer for the bookstore, said the publisher sets a retail ,
price for the books. Included in this is a 20% discount in '

most cases. -

V “From this discount the bookstore must cover-postage,
handling, salaries and overhead of the bookstore. Thus,
textbook profits are minimal,” he added.

Livewire sympathizes with the Life Sciences 21 students,
but books assigned seem justifiable.

 New Security System) COUA

BY LISA RUBEN STEIN

A new security system, includ-
ing a resident escort policy, will go
into effect September 15 in all Pitt
resident halls, according to Office
of Residence Life Assistant Direc-
tor Jo Ann Woodson Gibbs.

The major change in the security
system will be a 24-your escort
policy to be initiated in the Quad
area residence halls. An 8 pm-7 am
escort system will begin in the
Towers and Lothrop residence.

Resident students will be requir-
ed to show their identiﬁcation meal
ticket cards, with a sticker
indicating their dormitories, to gain
entrance to the residence halls.
Gibbs explained the Office of
Residence Life will issue similar

identiﬁcation cards to resident
students without meal plans.

According to Gibbs, a guest
visiting a resident will have to show
his ID, sign in with the desk
attendant, and wait for the resident
to escort him into the dorm. The
resident will have to show the meal
ticket identiﬁcation card to_ the desk
attendant and sign the guest in and
out.

“The student will have to
cooperate,” Gibbs explained.
“Not only will the residents be
responsible for signing their guest
in and out, the residents will be
responsible for escorting their
guest at all times.

“By instituting the escort policy,
we hope to eliminate the problem

The final plan for the implemen-
tation of the new coupon exchange
system, accommodating a max-
imum number of students in Pitt’s
limited stadium seating, has been
drawn up by a joint committee of
University ofﬁcials and student
leaders. Here is how the coupon
exchange will work.

The new system will consist of
two steps--coupon booklet distri-

bution and the exchanging of

coupons for individual game
tickets.

All full-time undergraduate and
graduate students who plan to
attend any or all home football
games must pick up a coupon
booklet. The coupon booklet
consists of ﬁve different colored
coupons, one representing each
game. These booklets will be

distributed Monday, September
15, through Thursday, September
18. The hours for all days will be
from 8:30 am through 8:30 pm. In
order to be eligible to attend
football games, you must pick up a

‘booklet on one of these four days

only.‘ The only identiﬁcation
required to receive a coupon
booklet will be a permanent or
temporary t‘1tt ll). '

The locations for coupon distri-
bution are as follows:

coupons.

If your last name begins with a

“Most of the study groups
agreed an escort policy could
conceivably be acceptable to
students in order to

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye initiated a
study of the system by the Office of
Residence Life and resident stu-
dents duringthe spring term to
offer suggestions for improvement
of the resident security system.

posed of faculty members and two
student representatives from each
of the three student governments,
will decide which members of
student organizations should be
compensated for" their services,
according to Assistant Director of
Student Affairs David Tive.

The Remunerations Board will'
send out applications to all student
organizations. Applicants will be
asked to explain the duties of their
positions, the amount of time
involved in their work, the amount
of out-of-the-pocket expenses in-
volved, and the experience or
qualifications needed for the
position, Tive said.

“These criteria will be used to
decide whether or not a student
should be paid for her services,”

_ Tive noted. -

The Remunerations Board will
evaluate the application and
interview the applicants. After the
positions of the applicants - are
evaluated, they will be placed on a
ten-grade scale. I '

The amount of money available
and the rating of the position on the
scale will determine how much
applicants will be compensated, if
at all. Compensation could be
made retroactive.

The SGB approved a motion by
Platt-to affiliate with the Remuner-
ations Board and allow applications
for compensation to the retroactive

 Afluestion of Purpose



' The demand by Pitt graduate student employes for a $1,0()0-a-year

salary increase is one of the chief issues at the Pitt Professional Union

(PPU) these days. But whether

or not the PPU has the graduate

/ student employe' interests at heart is questionable. --

The current $3,000 salary for teaching assistants, teaching fello
andgraduatestudentassistants,thoughminuteifonetries toliveoffit
alone, was never intended to ftuiction as a subsistence income. And
thoughnevertiedtotheeostofliving, thesalarynevertheless hasbeen
increased by simll increments of two and three per cent over the years.

In June Provost Rhoten Smith announced that the ﬁve per cent pay
increase given to the University faculty also would apply to graduate
student employes. But wanting to have the salaries increased with
inﬂation, the PPU has, on numerous occasions, spoken out and even
demonstrated for a pay raise of over one third.

, In addition to salary, graduate student employes have $50 deductible
health care plans and receive free tuition, all for 20 hours a week
teaching or researching for the University. I

Though by no means synonymous with graduate student employes,
the PPU may want to publicize the salary issue for different reasons.
Regardless of any merits the pay proposal may have, the PPU can

easily capitalize on the publicity

it receives during the issue. This

would be beneﬁcial since it is reportedly not one of the favorite
 unionsofPitt faculty, ifindeeduniversity faculty decide in

favor of imionization.

‘When asked the principal reason for the PPU’s tight for the $1,000

Ticket System

Shoved Through

What price principles?

On Tuesday, September 2, I first
learned of the new ticket distribu-
tion system. Several days later, an
emergency Student Affairs Advi-

sory Committee meeting was held, _

which I attended. Also present at
the meeting were Chancellor
Posvar, Casimir Myslynski, Dr.
Alfred Moye, William Markus, and
various student leaders. The
football ticket distribution system
was the only topic discussed, and it
is to this subject which I would now
refer.

Let me first state that this is my
own opinion, and does not
necessarily represent the opinion of
the Student Government Board.

The rapidity . with which this
matter was handled left much to be
desired. ,With extremely short
notice, students were issued a new
ticket system, and in essence,-were
told to come up with a better
system or acquiesce in’ the
proposed one. I vehemently argued
that the present method by which
students enter football games was
adecviate. Talking to many stu-

dents, I found this type of status
quo (first come-first served) situa-
tion to be the most desired. ltwas
within this spirit that I fought for a
continuance of that status quo.

The colored-coupon ticket distri-
bution system is going to happen.
Maybe it is happening because
myself and others didn't have
enough to argue; then again,
maybe not. In any event, it will
happen.

At the beginning of this ticket
issue, I stood" firmly opposed to
any change in procedure. I so
stand now. '

_ Regardless of my position on the
matter, students will be picking up
coupons next week. Many students
have told me that I let them down
because I didn’t argue enough.
After being, convinced that argu-
ment was of no advantage, I aided
in improving the coupon system.
Although this is contradicting to

_ my opinion on the existence of such
a system,
beneficial to have student partici-
pation
aspects of this new system.

My involvement with the system’
does not representapproval inany
way, but simply illustrates the fact
that Iwanted to improve a measure
which was forced upon us.

Latter day Trojan Horse I H 4

Cracks in the United Nations

BY DAN MULHOLLAND

The past few months have
witnessed an ever-increasing tide
of unfavorable opinion in this
country toward the United Nations.

The public ﬁnally is becoming
aware that his organization that
was packaged and sold to them by
the Establishment media as man-
kind's “last hope for survival". is
not all it was cracked up to be.
In fact. even some members of that
same establishment are beginning
to mouth platitudes in .which they
' of our
role in the UN.

- While many may seem amazed

"at the current erratic behavior of
this international debating society,

concerned Americans have come to
the realization long ago that the

Alger Hiss. who was later revealed
to be a perjurer and Communist
spy. present whitewash attempts
notwithstanding. This should hint
at the UN's suspicious origins.

Moreover, that same Hiss, along
with his comrade Molotov, con-
spired that the head of the UN
military arm, the UNEF, would
always be a Russian general
appointed by the Kremlin. This
was a major factor in the “no win”
situation in the Korean conflict.
MacArthur and the other American
generals constantly had the orders
countermanded by the Russians,
who still held on to their UNEF
positions even though they had
been boycotting the security
council.

This is also the reason why the

UN has consistently turned its head
when Communist atrocities are
involved. Not even the most timid
of protests were issued concerning
the Russian rape of Hungary in
I956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. of
the shameful persecution of Jews
behind the Iron Curtain, of the
terrorist activities of the Palestin-
ians or Vietcong. of Indira Ghandi’s
enslavement of India, or of the
ruthless murder of sixty-six million
people in China since Mao Tse
Tung and his fellow butchers
illegally came to power...the list
could go on forever.

On the other hand, the UN is
quick to use force when it serves
the purposes of the bizarre New
World Order. The most horrifying
example of this was in the Congo in

Wednesday, September 10, 1975-'-1"HE PITT NEWS—-Page 5    

the early 1960's. UN forces were
called in to crush the separatists in
the Katanga province who were
Christian and pro western. By the
time the “peace keepers" had
finished their appointed task:
Katanga lay in ruins. Schools and
hospitals had been bombed.
innocent civilians, including wo-
men and children had been
slaughtered. and the cities had
been plundered and pillaged.
What makes this bloodbath
harder to take is that a large
amount of the expeditions’ ex-
penses came from the UNICEF
fund. This money is in part raised
by American children on Hallo-
ween. Deluded by propagandists
in the schools and on TV. little
Johnny and his donors are led to
believe that they are helping to
feed starving waifs when in
actuality they are unwitting ac-
complices in international crime.
Thelist of other UN inequities is
too long to-mention here. The

unfair treatment of Israel, Rhode-
sia. South Africa‘, and Free China’

are only a few of the most glaring A. *

instances. But in the ﬁnal analysis,
the UN is indeed the Fearful
Master that G. Edward Griffin
spoke of in his book. Patriotic
Americans should at least be

indigant and hopefully outraged at-- 2- 
the fact that large parts of the’UN ~ . 
charter are verbatim quotes from - 

the Soviet Constitution.

If we wish to retain any part of I I

our rapidly disintegrating national

sovereignity. we must act quickly .. r I

to expel this latter-‘day Trojan
Horse from the shore of the East
River. If this is done. and the
lion's share of the financial support
now borne by the United States is

removed, the UN will collapse like’

a house of cards built too high. But
if we don't take decisive action
soon. our freedoms will
engulfed in an Orwellian chaos, no
win wars, and never ending

I oppression. Get US out!

 

be-

only acceptable “reevaluation” is

total and final withdrawal of the

Goodbye Tuck, Hello Chef

,.

BY BILL MOORE

Granted, the Tuck Shop did have
friendly, grandmotherly ladies
dishing out the food and ringing up
the orders on outdated cash
registers, but the food...well,
frankly, the food wasn't all that
great.

Now change comes to the
Cathedral’s ground floor and a few
frat guys with nothing better to do
than sit around in the Tuck Shop
start complaining.

Well the world is changing, and
so is the food industry, and despite
the fraternities, Pittites will have to
learn to accept computerized cash

gfgisters, youthful counterhelp and
"‘.«..1per Shefs in place of their

beloved Tuck Shop.

Worse things could happen.

The new Burger Chef franchise,
in all its red-blue-orange elegance,
is not as bad a place as some would
have you think.

The prices are fair, the burgers
warm, the shakes cold, the fries
crisp, the salds green and the
organge drink orange.

For some ungodly_reason, the
“‘l00% all-beef burgers” are
called, in order of size and price,
Big Shefs and Super Shefs, as
‘opposed to Big Chefs and Super
Chefs.

Willard and His Bowling
Trophies--A Perverse Mystery,
Richard Brautigan, Simon and
Schuster, $5.95, 167 pp.

Richard Brautigan has ﬁnally
come up with the perfect solution to
the problem of venereal warts. ‘I
can’t tell you what that is, but upon
reading his latest novel, Willard
and His Bowling Trophies (A
Perverse Mystery),- the answer to

 pissing on the toilet seat and
"spraying your shoes will be
' revealed.

Having had to deal with warts
myself I found his solution quite
alarming. Bob, Constance’s

. husband, contracted them from

her, because she had slept with a
middle-aged lawyer who had read
her not-so-good-selling book and
he said he liked it. They have to

burn warts off. _
Bob had an alarming fascination

with the Greek Anthology and had
developed an interest in The Story

of O, which led to an amateur .

sadist trip. Bob had developed a
distrustful memory and hated
using rubbers when they did
it...“He hungered like a lost star
for the evening sky of her inner

 touch."

Pat and John live downstairs and
in their room they have a paper
mache bird and a bunch of bowling
trophies. They found them in the
back seat of a car. The bird’s name
was Willard and he liked his
trophies. They weren't his,
though.

The Logan brothers loved to
bowl. During the sweet youth they
had received wide attention as the
best bowlers around and could
show it with their bowling trophies.
One night they went to see a Paul
Newman movie they thought was
about bowling...it wasn't. Upon
returning home "they discovered

their trophies has been

to seek vengeance on those poor
souls forthat wrongdoing.

Richard Brautigan is still some-

With his novel In Watermelon
Sugar possibilities arose tofboost

' him into stardom with high school

English teachers sneaking into
their classrooms for private read-

Yet, Brautigan never seems to
publish the right type of pablum
the social hip-literait wants. His
esoteric images and subconscious
reﬂections are the heart of his

l

works, alongwith a wit and sense
of humor unusual enough to curl
Hemingway’s typewriter ribbon.
In his works to date Brautigan
has avoided “statement” novels
and poems. Besides his poem
“June 5, 1968” he tries to dispense
with making anyone believe what
he does or even directly state what
he believes. ‘  -‘

Now’s my chance to get them;

Sophomore Susan Wright is an
expert in the art of scampering.
She and Marilyn are responsible
for keeping track of when each prop
must appear on stage. But even if
a prop is used once, it may be used
again.

“One night I utterly ‘forgot that
the “Twinkies” used in the fourth
scene are also used in the sixth
scene,” Susan explained.

“You know, ” Susan continues as
she ﬂies through her prop cues,
“you really should see this with the
lights. At the end it’s hysterical
because the audience isn’t quite
sure exactly when the play ends.”

“Alright, ready...let’s begin,
Becca states. “There are no lights
tonight. I don't know_ what

for the team but for self-gratifica-
tion. Running is my mode of
self-expression. Some people
express themselves in music, but
being that I never learned how to
play an instrument and can’t sing
worth a damn, l’ve had to make do

Just as an accomplished musi-
cian has to put in long hard hours of
practice before a debut, so Nick
practices to get in shape for the
grueling cross-country season. ,

With‘ a‘regimen that includes
90-100 miles of running per week,
weight lifting and hours of
ﬂexibility exercises, Martin is
getting ready to end his ﬁnal
season at Pitt with a big bang, an
apt ﬁnish for someone whose
nickname is “Bang-Bang." The
outlook for the coming season is
ﬁne IF Martin can avoid serious
injury.

A broken leg in the Penn State
cross-country meet last season cost
Martin a lot of training and
improvement in both cross country
and track. Nick was able to get
only five weeks of practice before
the track season because of his
injury and consequently did not run
up to his potential.

not at your best out there," says

Women’s Tennis Adds
‘Flash’ Gordon  

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherettes’ tennis team will
have a new coach when they hit the
courts this fall. Nancy “Flash"
Gordon, a Pitt alumna, hopefully
will guide the team to a‘ better
season than last year's 6-3 record.

Gordon previously coached junior
tennis at the Pittsburgh Raquet

' Club, and forms, with partner Gail

DiCicco, one of the top-ranked
doubles teams in _the Allegheny
Mountains Tennis Association. '

 -f A1t’rifoug_h- fGordoi1r* warns‘ -‘of?’ a“ " ’ ‘W’ “r‘(:'miri7rmir1*«m"17:7/7=”“r.?)"'

 

“rigid training program as far as
physical workouts—-it's going to be
tough!"--there is a tremendous
turnout of hopeful athletes, includ-
ing nearly half of last year's squ-ad.

Gordon is using World Team
Tennis (WTT) rules during the
tryouts, and possibly for the season
if opponents will cooperate. Al-
though WTT rules put more
pressure on the player, Gordon
prefers them because, “lt’s fair to
both sides. I think we'll be able to
use it."

    

 

  

might have been able to break four
minutes last season, opening the
door for a national ranking.

A lot of people will be watching
“Bang-Bang.” this fall as he
attempts to stay in the number-one
position he has enjoyed for two
years on the cross-country team.
The most important onlooker will
be Coach Mike Agostinella.

“Nick is being challenged for the
number-one spot by Mel Boyd,”
says the new cross-country coach.
“Boyd and Nick ran the same time
at our time trials, but it's really
hard to tell until we have our first
meet his season.”

Nick will have to work hard to
keep his number-one spot, but this
will be no new experience for him

I as he has had to work hard ever '

since he started his track career.

“I feel my greatest contribution
to the team is that I'm a hard
worker," he says. “When I started
out in high school, the facilities
were awful. We had to train on city
streets. It made things ’extra
,difﬁcult to train. in substandard
conditions.”

Those substandard conditions
didn’t stop him from winning the
Tri-State and Central

Catholic ‘

lnvitationals, two very prestigious
events. Nick suffered a slight
disappointment in the state finals,
though, when he had to take
second place in the state finals in
the mile run. The difference
between Martin and first place was
one tenth of a second.

Ever since then, Martin has been
number one. Except for his
freshman year, “Bang-Bang" has
been ‘the number-one man on the
cross-country team and he has
earned the team MVP award the
last two seasons. '

There are a lot ofresponsibilities

_that go with being number one, but

you won’t ﬁnd anyone more eager
to fulﬁll those responsibilities than
Nick. '

“Not only do I have to run
number one, but I have to provide
leadership for the younger guys on
the team. You might even say that
I’m a kind of babysitter,” says
Martin with a smile.” “A lot of
kids come here, have everything
paid for them and end up living in a
dream world. It’s my job to get
them out of that.”

Like Jim Anderson on Father’

Knows Best, Martin attempts to
impress the young runners with his

    

philosophy.

“You can’t look at athletics as
being your whole life," preaches
Father Martin from his room in the
intensive study ward. “You’ve got
to give academics equal time,
‘cause when you ﬁnally stop
running, and you’ve got to stop
sometime, there's got to be
something else for you to do with
your life." , -

In the meantime, though, Nick
will‘ continue to concentrate a lot on
his running, even if for only this
last year,’ cause after this season
he'll have to ﬁnd another way to
express himself. '

Maybe it's not too late to take up
piano.

Jury Mends Defense  

BY JIM SIPANOS I

Being a defensive back is, at
best, the kind of occupation that
gives a person gray hairs 20 years
prematurely“. Bob Jury is a
defensive back.

But hey, he doesn’t have any
gray.

Jury started his ﬁrst collegiate
game against Georgia, and he
played a very ﬁne game at that.
The post-game statistics showed
that Jury had ﬁve unassisted and

‘one assisted tackle, but even that

isn't indicative of the caliber of
game he played. He also found
time to make two fumble recoveries
and two game-saving tackles.
"The kid played a heckuva
game," said secondary coach Joe
Madden “He got a rating of

    

    

81%," Madden continued, “and
that's ‘amazing, because a score of
65% is good. lt’s really rewarding
to have seen Bob play such a good
game."

Jury is one of two sophomores on
the starting defensive team [the

other is Randy Holloway]. The 19-
year-old received ten letters at
South Park High just, outside of
Pittsburgh in his younger days.

Playing as precarious a position
as defensive back makes most
players ﬁdgety in those agonizing
moments just before game time
when the band is playing the
National Anthem and the fans eat
peanuts and make noise. Jury is
now exception.

“Sure, I was nervous at ﬁrst,"
he admitted, ”but after the ﬁrst
couple of plays things were okay._ I
was just out there trying to do my
job, that’s all. After a while you
don’t even realize‘ the fans are
there, you become so involved" in.
the game." .

Jury passed his first test against
Georgia, but there are ten games
left " on the schedule and the
possibility exists someday Jury will
“get burned.”

When a defensive back is beaten
by a receiver on the opposing team
on a deep pattern, that's called
“getting burned'.’,’ A defensive
back is as susceptible to getting
burned as .a baby is to germs, and
he has to live with the thought on
every play. '

“The secondary has a .lot of
responsibility," Jurfy explains.
“Primarily we’re, responsible for
the pass, but I’m also supposed to
contain the option and make it
come to the inside. Before each
play ljust say to myself 'Don’t let
yourself get beat.’

“If you do make a mistake,
just have to forget about it.
Everybody’s going to make a

Couldn't Play Football
Morahan Loves Soccer

BY STEVE SYBERT

At one time,‘ the dream of every
American boy was to grow up to be
a professional baseball, football or
basketball player. Many made it.
but many more did not. Nowadays,
with the expanded sports scene, it
is possible for those who cannot
crack the “big three" to pursue
one of the other sports popular
today.

Pitt soccer player John Morahan
is just one of many athletes to rise
into the limelight of one sport after
an unsuccessful try in another.
Morahan started to play football in
high school, but his small frame
was a major factor in his decision to
switch to soccer, where size makes
no difference.

Morahan soon grew to love his

High School and acting as team
captain his senior year. The
Panther left winger has several
reasons for taking up what
probably is the world's number-one
team sport.

“Everybody tries football be-
cause that's the more accepted
American game," Morahan said.
"But soccer is more accepted by
people of the world. And by
playing soccer. you get the chance
to meet people from all around the
world.

“As a player, I’m more involved
in soccer because everyone out on
the field gets a chance to touch the
ball. You never know when it’s
your turn and. you have to be
ready.”

Currently. soccer may be re-

certain number of mistakes; that's
just the way it is."

During spring drills, Jury weigh-
ed in at 200 pounds. If he had
remained at that weight, he could
have had a shot at‘ All-American
waterboy. Realizing Johnny
Majors doesn’t enjoy such heavy
defensive backs, Jury went to
work. . '
“I ran and liftedrweights all
summer long,” Jury said. “We
had lost two guys at defensive back
due to graduation (David Spates
and Glenn Hodge) and the coaches
said Ihad the best shot at starting.
I wasn't about to relinquish the job
to anybody." ,

After Jury had packed his
American Tourister bag, he headed
for Johnstown, ﬁrmly believing he
could get a starting job. He didjust
that, despite some competition
from James Wilson, a transfer from
Tampa.

The Panther defense dominated
Georgiain the second half after an
unimprcssive first-half showing.
This occurred against the team that

was supposed to be as skilled at,

offense as Newtontwas at mathe-
matics. ,

During the game, the Bulldogs
made a few critical mistakes, like
fumbling on the Pitt four-yard line
in the ﬁrst quarter and fumbling a
punt in the fourth that ,Ju'ry
recovered. A

“I guess I was in the right place
at the right time," Jury said;
"Besides recovering those fum-
bles, it was just great being a part
of it all, knowing I was contribu-
ting." -

and more professional and amateur
leagues are being formed than ever
before. A

But many people turn away from
soccer because they say they don't
know what's going on out there. In
truth, soccer is probably more
easily understood by Americans
than baseball would be by a
foreigner.

“The more publicity soccer
gets," Morahan said, “the more
people will learn how easily
understandable it is. People now
understand hockey, which, if you
look back, is actually based on rules
from soccer.”

Soccer at Pitt goes relatively
unnoticed ifcompared to any of the
nllicl‘ major sports. but —plans are

keep in step ' with the over-all

A Morahan Picks Soccer, Nancy Gordon
Too Small for Football

(‘Continued from Page 12)

“Publicity is a big problem,”
Morahan said. “The football team
gets a lot while the soccer team
gets little or no attention at all.
Exposure before and after the
football games will help us to show
people that there is a soccer team
at Pitt.” ‘

A beefed-up schedule may draw
more people to the games, but
Morahan believes the quality of
players also will have to be
up-graded in order to meet the
demands of a rigorous schedule.

“We are getting good players at
Pitt, but because of meager funds,
we can't get a superstar or even a
stand-out. We just can't get great
players as Akron and other teams
do,” Morahan said.

Still, the outlook for Pitt this year
is a good one. “If the defense
holds, the offense will get the job
done,” Morahan said. “With Alan
jutca in the middle and John Curley
and me as the wings, we have a lot
of experience on the front line. We
never took the shots last year and,
with the schedule we’re playing,
we just have to produce more
goals.”

Morahan, a senior, takes soccer
seriously and considers making a
career of it in one respect or
another. He believes soccer is
headed up and that it’s only a
matter of time until it reaches the
top.

“Within the next ﬁve to ten ‘

years, soccer is going to make it or
break it and if it does make it, I
want to be there.”

“ “I would say three-fourths of the

girls look pretty good,” Gordon
commented after observing the
first tryout session on Monday
afternoon.

“By the end of the week we
should be down to 15.”

_'l‘he Pantherettes will participate

seasons, beginning on September
20 at the Slippery Rock Invitational.
The home opener is September 24
against West Virginia, a contest
Gordon views as “a tough match,
probably the strongest competition
we’ll have.”

Nancy Gordon is justifiably
conﬁdent predicting the outcome of
her ﬁrst season of coaching at Pitt.
“We’ll do quite well; we probably
have one of the strongest teams in
the area and I deﬁnitely expect tot
have a winning season." ‘

The Ghost of Soccer Past will

Only in this Christmas story the
visiting Akron soccer team is the
Scrooge and the Pitt soccer team is
Bob Cratchet.

The Ghost reminds us of the last
time these two teams "met--three
years ago, in 1972--when the
miserly Akronians hoarded all the
goals from the starving Pitt
Panthers ina close game, 2-0.

Despite the loss, Pitt played
well. Akron, synonymous for
soccer greatness, went on to
become on of soccer’s, best that
year, beating a Federal City team

advancing to the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association (NCAA)
playoffs, only to lose a close contest
to NCAA champs Southern Illinois.

Akron promises to have another

great season, with a quick,

explosive offense anchored by
George Nanchoff, All Mid-West
last year and touted as an
All-American prospect this year,
and Paul Eucker, an All-American
from Merrimack Junior College in
St. Louis.

Also ominously roaming around‘

the opposition’s net will be Bob
Smith, who contributed nine goals
and eight assists last season for
Akron.

Bill Polick, an outstanding defen-
seman for Akron since he joined
the team.

Even though Akron returns to
Pitt Stadium with only a 6-5-1
record from last year, the Ghost
reminds us Akron competed with
such overly talented teams as
Cleveland State, Buffalo State, and
Bowling Green of Ohio. Even still,
Akron believes it can widely
improve on last year’s mark this
year with good competition. And
they have good reason to believe
so.

First of all, Akron recruited six
St. Louis players for this year. So
what, you say? Well, it just so
happens that St. Louis is the
“hotbed of American soccer.” To

Louis would give any coach reason
to start dusting off the trophy case
early.

Couple that with the fact in
pre-season exhibitions, Akron has
demolished TWO I Canadian ama-
teur soccer clubs by socres of 7-2
and 8-0 and you can see what
Akron expects.

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis is doing
some looking ahead of his own,
however. He has high hopes for his
4-6-2 team of last year," despite that
one-third of /the Panthers’ soccer
team is made up of inexperienced
freshmen. .

He is conﬁdent his young,
talented team plays well as a unit
and is not merely a weak team
boasting one or two, superstars.
The team hopes to have all the
.ingredients needed to make an
exciting season--an explosive of-
fense, led by one of last year’s top
scorers, John Curley, a tough
defense able to cripple the
opponent, and strong team leader-
ship by seniors Al Ju'tca, Ernie
Gross and John Morahan.

The use of phoney credit cards, electronic devices or any other means to avoid
paying for phone calls is against the law. lt’s stealing—pure and simple. ‘

In this state, conviction for making fraudulent phone calls may result in:

I A fine of up to $15,000

I Up to seven years in jail ~ .
I Restitution for the total cost of the fraud
I Court costs

I A permanent criminal record

One more thing: modern electronic computer systems are being used to track down
offenders. -

The penalties may seem harsh. But the cold fact remains that the law does not look
on phone fraud as a lark.
