A ROTC sponsored press conference,

yesterday turned intoa heated discussion
when members of the anti—ROTC faction
voiced their position. The conference was
organized by Reserve General James Ro-
berts, owner of Sykes Advertising, and
commander of~the Army Reserve Units
in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West
Virginia. General Roberts stated that the
purpose of the conference was:

“To make available a time for ROTC
to tell their side of the controversy.
Across the US, and not just in Pittsburgh,
there is an organized attempt to discredit
the ROTC from various collegesiand. uni-
versities.” ‘

“The Army is heavily dependent on

ROTC because they get one half of‘

 To Discuss ‘Economics

The Second Pittsburgh Conference on Urban Organizing opened
here today in the auditorium of the Graduate School of Public Health.
The two days of talks and workshops, sponsored by the Graduate
School of Social Work, is featuring Roy Innis, associate national di-
rector of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE ), as the main speaker.

The other speakers who will participate are Frank Mankiewicz,
former press secretary to the late Robert.F. Kennedy; Preston Wilcox.

The Conference theme is “Eco-

Student representatives of ROTC
from Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon, and
Pitt attended the meeting. The represen-

the movement to get ROTC thrown off
their campus is being controlled by SDS.
He went on to say that SDS was thinking
of having a student referendum, but
nothing had yet been done.

Dave Ehrenworth and Jack LaPietra
represented this university’s ROTC bri-
gade. Their position was that ROTC had
been supported by a student referendum
taken last January, and this had not
been considered by the Undergraduate
Council when they voted to discredit the
ROTC program. They also referred to a
student petition in favor of keeping ac-
credidation that was signed by over

LaPietra asserted that his organization,

Innis first became associated
with CORE -activities in 1962.
He was instrumental in changing
the CORE philosophy from a
non-violence one to one in favor
of black power, self-determina-

from integrationist goals to a
movement for control of institu-
tion s in predominately black
areas. In September. 1967, he was
named executive director of the
Harlem Commonwealth Council,
a group formed to develop small
industries and an investment cor-
poration in Harlem.

In March of last year, Innis led
a campaign calling for an inde-
pendent board of education for
Harlem. Regarded as one of the
most important black power‘pro-
grams in Harlem, the drive has
succeeded in having a proposal
for an independent school board

which they are dependent. We oppose the po-

it is designed to protect the interests of a se-

“The problems of‘ contemporary American
society arise from the inability of the interests
of the elite to be consistent with the interests
. major portions of American society.
The elite have consistently concealed their
concern for their own self-interest in the guise
of extensive philosophies emphasizing the
importance of hard work as a means to move
up the social ladder, and the value of every-

Congress Reduces Eda cation Grants;
College Students Suffer Cutbacks

According to The Chronicle
of Higher Education, a 78 per-
cent cutback is expected next fall
in the number of college students
receiving initial awards under
the federal program of educa-
tional opportunity grants.

Only 31,300 needy students will
get the first year grants next
fall, compared with 144,600 this
fall according to estimates by
administrators in the U.S. Of-
fice of Education.

Their projections followed a
surprise reduction of $16 mil-
lion in Congressional appropri-
ations for the program- The
White House had asked for
$140.6 million, _the same amount
that Congress provided last year,
but this was reduced by a Sen-
ate-House conference commit-
tee. The lower figure was then
adopted when the ‘appropriations
bill for the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare came up
for final passage.

David Johnson, head of the edu-
cational opportunity branch in the
Office of Education, said the cut-
back would be “devastating.”
He noted that the grant program

includes the renewal of awards ~.

to previous recipients, and that
this leaves only first year
awards, going mostly to college
freshmen, with which to absorb
budget cuts.

The result is that next year
the Office of Education expects
to have less money for first year
grants than at any time since the
first grants were awarded in the

1966-1967 academic year.

Johnson said it was “inexcus-
able” that the conference commit-
tee had not investigated the mat-
ter more than it did. Had it done
so, he said, it would have real-
ized that the program needed
additional funds just to keep peace
yvith its previous level of opera-

Four weeks ago the Commit-

creation of a coordinating com-

cerned with the results of the for-
um discussions.

As its final and possibly most
important objective, the Sex
and Sexuality Committee plans
to present its findings to the Uni-
versity administration and to
work with them in establishing
an interdisciplinary Sex Educa-
tion class within the regular Uni-
versity curriculum. Serving as dis-
cussion leaders, instructors from
the various departments of social
study would attempt to -focus dis-
cussion toward analysis of student
sexual and emotional problems in
terms of their specific field. Via
this interdisciplinary method, the
committee hopes that students will
form a well-rounded, emotional-
ly wholesome sexual self — concept.

At the close of last Friday’s
meeting, Toni Grossi, one of the
committee's founders, stated,

  Same Old Thing

‘O O The ROTC controversy reached its “McCarthyite” pinnacle
;yesterday when Army Reserve General James Roberts made
f some serious allegations ‘at a press conference held at Sykes Ad-
vertising Agency—an agency owned by the General.

 The press conference was scheduled in the words of the
General, “to make available a time for ROTC to tell their side
,of'the story.‘ Across the nation, and not just in Pittsburgh,”
charged the General, “There is an organized attempt to dis-
fcredit ROTC from various colleges and universities.”

A General Roberts failed to point out a number of specific
;facts. He failed to identify the organization that is attempting
-,'to discredit ROTC at the University. He failed to mention that
 ne of the University students representing ROTC, David Ehren-
iworth, is a member of the student organizationthat recommend-
_.ed that ROTC lose, its accredidation. The General also chose not
to point out that the Undergraduate Council heard arguments
-om both factions in the controversy. Col. Claggett and Maj.
ordon were given ample time to tell “their side of the story”

othe Undergraduate Council.

 It is upsetting that General Roberts failed to point to these
cts. Instead of citing local facts, the General focused on some
;national myths—myths which have no basis at the University. In
(short, Gen. Roberts was appealing to fears of the community-
‘the fear that anarchistic rebels are trying to disrupt and ultimate-
.-destroy ROTC.

This is simply not the case. The members of the Academy
§Cabinet of the College are not members of SDS or any other sim-
filar groups. They are simply acting as concerned students with
R "keen interest in academic legitimacy. Moreover, the "Academ-
Cabinet did not initiate the movement to take away credit
. rom ROTC; it was initiated by a Faculty Senate Committee.

. The argument surrounding the ROTC squabble has be-
come a shotgun affair. All sorts of unrelated statements are‘be-
"g thrown about. This is damaging because members of the
, tudent body and thepublic are getting a wharped picture of
’:It_he issues. Members of ROTC have neglected to refute the
.’charge that the accredidation of ROTC violates a dogma of
, , iglier education—— the principle of academic freedom; they have
{not ‘cleared the air around a basic contradiction: ROTC curri-
{culum is controlled by the Defense Department, but the courses
’ re considered part of the University curriculum.

 It is easy to see that ROTC courses are not part of the Uni-
versity course. It is a student activity, which demands prepara-
1-«tion. Of _ course, other student organization’s demand prepara-
7tio_n and time, but these “other activities”.don’t give their mem-
ers credits toward graduation; they don’t pay their members
‘monthly salaries. '

_ This malaise becomes epidemic when members of the
:%._ROTC brigade—and representatives of the 'Army—refuse to de-

aculty. Rather than schedule a discussion before the Faculty
}Senate, the ROTC Department is taking their case to the com-
:.munity, by arranging press and TV coverage. This tactic be-
comes strong when Army representatives talk about national
zorganized attempts to disrupt ROTC. This tactic becomes
junethical when representatives of the Brigade ignore the basic.
issues before local T.V. cameras-. All of this tends to mislead the
7_-public into believing that ROTC has been the victim of some
‘Aperfidious plot.

l; , Such a tactic will undoubtedly create a great deal of public
* reaction against those individuals advocating the loss of accredi-
j-dation for ROTC. Such a tactic implies that the ROTC Depart-
;__t_nent is soliciting public pressure that could alter the decision
--‘of the faculty. If this is not the case, why did the ROTC De-
{__=_-partments in Pittsburgh decide to schedule a news conference?
/There seems to be no answer to the question.

3, The Pitt News believes the faculty should not be influenced
by public pressure. Some members of the faculty are begin-
gnmg. to wonder if the issues involved in the ROTC debate are
worth possible financial loss to the University. We feel the is-
.plles~ are paramount, for they reflect the very integrity of this
;institution. If the philosophy’ of accredidation remains the same,
» we urge the faculty—in spite of alleged covert pressures—to take

.,bate before the group that will make the ultimate decision, the.

‘Winning rAttitude’ Hawks Meet
Owl Owls In 1968 Toilet Bowl

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor
SCHENLEY OVAL - The field has been laid-
out. The stands have been erected. The game stra-
tegies have been prepared. The Police protection
has been organized to protect the players from
their fanatical fans. The queen candidates have

been chosen. The hour-long float parade has been '

set-up.

The newspaper reporters and columnists from
49 states, the three TV
Networks, and the coun-
try’s leading broadcasting
stations have been noti-
fied and they will be here
Sunday. _

For it's that time again;
time for the traditional-
Toilet Bowl.

THE TOILET BOWL,
the oldest game on record,
again pits The Pitt News
Hawks against the Owl
Owls.

The game, always sold
out two years in advance,
gets underway Sunday at .
10:30 a.m. here in the plush surroundings of the
Oval, that so-called lovers’ carnage.

Here, overlooking the University.campus, the
Toilet Bowl has had its home for many years.
Originally scheduled for Jan. 1, the bowl committee
was asked to reschedule the game because of the

 

LIES

one in the pressmedia was going to cover the other
bowls, if the game had been played on New Year’s
Day.)

Wreaked in tradition, this year’s game be-
tween the two journalistic powerhouses is a rubber
match. In the past four years, each two has won the
games.

A RUNDOWN of those games:

——l964: Owls 12, Hawks 7—Played on a hund-
red-yard-long field, the game was truly a defensive
struggle.’ A pass interception early in the game
proved costly for the Hawks, and Bov Smizik ended
his collegiate career on a sour note.

———1965: Owls 20, Hawks 0—The game was
marked by the absence of yours truly, who slept-
in.

———1966: Hawks 6, Owls O—Another defensive
game marred only by Earl Fischel’s arguing that
‘he tabbed yours truly before yours truly scored.

——1967: Hawks 18, Owls‘ 6—‘«A runaway for the
Hawks, who held an 18-0 lead at the half (three
TDs by guess who?) and put-in the second team
for the remainder of the game.

THE HAWKS, riding a _two_game Toilet Bowl
‘winning streak and 3-0 this season, are again the

fayorites.

Besides talent, the Hawks have one of the fin-
' est winning attitudes at the University. It is a team
that knows it will win as soon as it walks on the
field. '
- ALL THE ‘PREPARATIONS have been made
for the game. Both teams are ready, because this
game above all other games is the supreme test.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The following is the text of a

you to see and which I’m sure

“TO THE EDITORS:

“Great radio stations are able
to lie. Great literature is not.”
These are the words of Svetova

first leading article back in 1956.

“From that time on, this mag-
azine made it possible for Czech
readers to know hundreds of the
most important literary works of
our time. As a country, we are
little known; if our culture were
judged in cars per family, it would
rate very low. But we have an-
other culture, a thousand—year—
old cultu're of written thoughts
and art, the culture of a nation
which had time and again to fight
for its very existence.

“In the name of this culture,
menaced today again by barbar-
ians, we turn to you, writers of
all countries! . M

Objects To ROTC. ‘View’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I must make some objections to
Rosenbloom’s column in
Monday’s paper.

1.’ I agree that it does take
two to debate, but it also takes
two to plan a debate and set a date
for it. It is hardly fair for one
side. to plan a debate and tell the
other side that it is going to look
like hell for them if they do not

__ show. If it is to be a fair debate,

both sides should have equal say
as towhen, where, and how it
will be held. ~

2. It was hardly a “funny
thing” that ROTC did not par-
ticipate. The members of WPGH
who planned the debate were in-
formed by Mr. LaPietra verbal-
ly and‘by a formal written state-
ment on Monday that they would
not participate.

3. The members of ROTC have
not been trying to avoid a debate
at all costs. As Mr. Rosenbloom
himself mentioned, they have
agreed to participate in a forum
on Nov. 22.

4. The members of ROTC,
believe it or not, do have lives of
their own, and there is no rea-
son why any one of them should

should cancel any previous plan

 

 

in order to satisfy one David Ro-
senbloom. .

5. As far as the ultimatum
goes, Mr. Rosenbloom’s article
makes it quite clear that there
was an ultimatum. He knew full
well that the members of ROTC
were not going to participate in
the .“debate.” On Nov. 11, he
did indeed proceed to make it look
likehell for the members of
ROTC.

6. On the question of coopera-
tion, I was always told that it
takes two parties to cooperate.
Why" should the members of
ROTC cooperate with Mr. Rosen-
bloom and WPGH, if neither of
them would cooperate with the
ROTC committee?

It seems to me that once again
David Rosenbloom has chosen to
exhibit his irresponsibility. In
his one-sidedness, he has dis-
torted the actual facts to rap
ROTC. I only wish that once he
would look at the other side and
its arguments. I wish, too, he
would stop painting the members
of ROTC as people to be hated
and just once consider them as
other human beings. O

While most University students were taking up
the last rays of the summer sun, WPGH was in the
midst of planning its own welcoming event — de-
signed to entertain returning students, acquaint
new students with the station, and most important,
to dowhatever small part it could to help the star-
rving Biafrans. The result of our efforts was tagged
the WPGH Biafra Marathon.

On August 31, WPGH DJ team Michaels and Se-
bastian mounted the specially erected platform
in the Towers lobby to take the first 24 hour shift.
For eight days the Great Eight continued its live

Dear Student:
WPGH RADIO has long been
suffering from what many

thought a terminal illness. Months
of hard labor, along with a few
basic transplants, have enabled
us to save your campus station.
Indeed it seems strange that no-
vice “med” students like our-
selves were able to drive it out
while the finest and most in-
fluential physicians at the Uni-
versity at first refused to ack-
nowledge our diagnosis. When
finally enlightened, however, in-
stead of destroying the cancer,
they felt it of greater value to
create a curing serum by taking
the bacteria out of the body and in-
jecting it into the head. We’re
not complaining, mind you, be-
cause we respect the competence
of our educators. We’ll merely
watch, though, to see if this
malignant growth will attempt
to again pervade the system with
A sickness. Let us hope, for all
concerned, that you made th
correct decision. * -

Our historical background may
be a mystery to you and for all
practical purposes is. inconsequen-
tial. Let me dwell no longer in

PGH Keeps You Informed

Most students think of WPGH as, solely, a music station. But be-
hind the scenes, the News Department is the most active of all the sta-
tion’s departments.

N ewcasting involves over half the staff. We have two primary news
sources at WPGH — our own campus reporters who cover campus stor-
ies and our United Press International teletype machine (UPI). An
explanation of preparation will probably best show the amount of work
done for a “simple” newscast.

It’s 7:30. The newscaster glances quickly at
_the ‘UPI machine and Campus News board. He
next goes into Studio A, picks uphis newscast
form, checks it, and tells the DJ which pre-re-
corded commercials (spots) are to be used during
the newscast. Then he returns to the news room and
calls the U.S. Weather Bureau for an up-to-date‘
forecast. He next rips the latest national and world
news from the UPI machine. With approximately
fifteen news items in front of him he selectsthe
five or six he’ll use. In Studio C, from which he
will actually broadcast, the reporter rehearses
his delivery and studies the content of his up-
coming broadcast.

The time now is 8 o’clock. he glances through
the soundproof glass partition and waits for the
dj to give him a visual cue. And then, on the air-
waves across the campus is heard, “This is the 8:00
o’clock edition of . . 

Since WPGH is the CAMPUS radio station,
it is vital to‘ cover events concerning campus or-
ganizations, ~ administrative decisions, and stu-
dent sentiment. To accomplish this task, approx-
imately a dozen members of the news staff scour the
University campus to report the important issues.

Listeners have been informed and stimulated

.by specials as the ROTC controversy, the Peace -

Corps, the 18 year old vote question, faculty and
administration interviews, Panhellenic Council
Rx forum, the draft resistance situation, and, of
course, our own election coverage.

   

 
   

around-the-clock broadcasting, switching teams of
dj’s every 24 hours.

Located in front of the podium was the most im-
portant element of the marathon. the Biafra Dona-
tion Bucket. Students passing the podium were re-
quested to drop what they could into the bucket in
return for a- request, a dedication, or for no other
reason than to help. «

lor and Craig Perry signed WPGH off-the-air; very
tired perhaps, but happy to have been part of one

Executive Board

Our Fearless Leaders

The WPGH Executive Board this year contains
a good cross section of the University Community.
Its members are all active prominent members of

the student body.

The Board consists of the Genral Manager, and
four divisional managers who determine the policy
the station shall follow. H.T. Duffy Gilfillan, as

General Manager, chairs this committee. A sen-
ior political science major with four years of sta-
tion service, Duffy has been involved in many facets
of station operations, including disc jockey, DJ
trainer, business manager, promotion, and co-pro-
gram director. In addition to his WPGH activi-.
ties, he is also a member of Pi Delta Epsilon and is
a former freshman swimming team member. ‘

Heading the’ Programming Division is a sen-
ior majoring in political science and Asian stud-
ies, Joanne Telerico. Extremely active at the Uni- -
versity since transferring from George Washing-
ton University,‘ Miss Telerico is presently a SG
Senator, member of the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee, and member of Committee to Restructure
SG: At WPGH, she has been a disc jockey-, news
director, general manager, and presently program
manager. In addition, Joanne belongs to the Citi-

uate assistants just on the basis of

‘ how hard they made their exams.

There was no standardization be-
tween tests for each division and
th e graduate assistants t h e m -
selves. ' '

To solve this probelm, “we are
training an d yearly evaluating
our graduate instructors based on
their teaching performance,”
pointed out Dr.. «Lewis. ‘Along
with this, there are meetings with
instructors and visitation of the
classes by a coordinator. ,

Recently, French 10 and 11
have been introduced. These
courses are designed for those stu-
dents who have had French pre-
viously. Ideally, French 1 and 2

'. M11 be reserved for those ‘stu-

dents who are beginning French
atthe University. Also, this com-

? _ing winter term, French 3 and 4’

will. ‘be divided‘-‘among students,

' who -wish and ‘do not wish to con-

tinue the study of French" lan-"

guage. “We think,” noted Dr.
Lewis, “homogeneous groups will
aid in the teaching and learning
process.”’

Recently there has been talk
on campus of substituting the

-teaching of‘ the French language

with the teaching of French cul-

ture. If it were decided -that a‘
change-over of this type is-desir-'

able, such.a move would take at
least -a few years to coordinate.
This fall term there are 76 sec-
tions of elementary and interme-
diate French. To accompany
these secions there are 39 instruc-
tors. These figures represent;-a
thnee-fold increase in ;the last
three years. The University ’s state

. ‘related. position, whiclr'_ha‘s-‘ re-

sulted in such a large increase in

viding good instruction. On top
of this “a big problem we face
today results from the lack of
high school standardization in in-
struction and course material,“

‘stated Dr. Lewis.

_ Because of this discussion
around the culture versus lan-

_‘guage requirement, “The depart- .
ment has discussed the possibil- :

ity of a idistribution course in
French ‘civilization and culture
which would be taught by a sen-
ior member of the department also
including recitation sections on
the intermediate level,” added
Dr. Lewis. — -

To further aid in the study of
the French language. a new Lan-
guage Laboratory has been open.

.»The'* department is now in the ‘
. process of -further improving the

tape programs. 0 Presently, the lab
should be considered part of the

homework and not as.a- separate a

entity.

Students who cannot justify the
study of French have been offer-
ed some reasons for spending time
in a French program. “By French

4, a student should comprehend.

most French used in everyday
contact and to be able to read

. contemporary newspapers and
‘magazines. We hope that they
-will be able to read an article in

the particular field. Also, students
should be able. to get through any
graduate exam,in French,” fin-

’ ished Dr. Lewis.

 Irish After-Effects Bug Cats
Refuse To Die

Panthers Brace fo r Cadets

by ART ROSENGARTEN

The meat grinder continues
to turn. With the disasters of
Miami and Notre Dame now
history, the Panther gridders
must regroup their battered
bodies and prepare to meet
a quickly improving Army
squad.

“Notre Dame was really some-
thing,” said a Dave Hart,
shaking his head. “It amazes
me how they lost two games this
season.

“They have the finest offensive
line that I’ve seen in a long time
on a college squad. They are de-
finitely much bigger than what

1 they are listed on the program,”

he continued. “and they‘ certain-

ly know how to use their size and
strength.”

According to Hart, Notre Dame
has averaged over 500 yards per
game in total offense and against
the Panthers they even improved
on it. The Irish rolled up 378
yards on. the ground and 172
yards through the air for a total
of 550 yards total offense.

The Irish scored every time
they had their hands on the ball
in the first half. Sophomore quar-
terback Joe Theismainn, the star
in last year’s Notre Dame—Cubs
freshman game, took over for the
injured Terry Hanratty and guid-
ed the Irish to their first six touch-
downs before being replaced by

y second and third stringers.

One of the most striking dif-

istuidﬂent Blasts Boot Coach Bemis

( The following letter um received .\Iondugj by

he Sports Department. )

I think it is time for the student body to recognize
he factthat it is not solely the fault of our ath-
etes, that Pitt is doing so badly in fall sports. Of
'ourse the outcome of the game rests in the players’
ands, but it is the coach’s responsibility to have
-he boys prepared both mentally and physically,
or every contest. The soccer team is an, excellent ’
xample of a coach not doing his job, and as a re-
ult, the squad has compiled a poor 2 and 7- record. .

It is one thing for a player to disagree with a
oach over policy, and quit the team. There is al-
ways one player who is dissatisfied with the coach-
ng methods employed. But it is something else
when six players out of twenty, have all quit be-
ause of their feelings toward the coach.

This fall, even before the season begangtwo
layers quit the team. One was a District All-
American last year, and both were to have started
his year. Coach Bemis was counting on each of

hem to supply the scoring punch that the team sore-

Just recently, two more members of the team
ave quit. Both were returning lettermen, and both
ad been starting. Two other players have also left

Walks-On Cul9SceneAs 

To pTailbacl<Substitute

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
“Jungle Cat” Willie Saloky got hischance to play foot-

ball in Friday’s 32-13 loss to Penn

Cat.”

State, but not as a “Jungle

Early in the first quarter, a minor injury to tailback Joe Carroll
put freshmen football coach Carl Kokor in a jam. But Willie Saloky

solved the problem.

“I don’t care where I play,”
said Saloky, “as long as I play.” V

Saloky is, technically speaking,
a walk-on. The 6-1, 195 pound
halfback is here on a wrestling
scholarship. But once the prac-
tices got under way, Saloky be-
came a vital member of the Cubs.

“I can’t get football out of my
admitted Saloky. “I
played linebacker and halfback
in high school and lettered three
years, but I was only able to get
a wrestling scholarship.”

Saloky was slated to see lim-

ited action in Kok,or’s newly de-
vised defensive unit, the “Jungle
Cats.” But when the “Jungle
Cats” ran on to the field to re-
lieve tried Cub defensemen, Sal-
oky was already in position.

Carroll, a two-way man, just

happened to be a linebacker also,
and so Saloky saw plenty of
action against the Little Lions. ‘

As a linebacker, Saloky helped,

the (Cub pass defense blank Penn
Statefs l3ob. Parsons andCreg Du-.~ ihef11b_g‘7reacly_. iv,’ 3   A

catte.’ But as a tailback, Saloky’sw

contribution was more obvious.
Saloky carried the ball only

four times, but picked up 17

' yards —— a 4.2 yards per carry av-

erage. However, the ex-Easton
High School star made his ma-
jor contribution in blocking.

“Of course I would have liked
to carry the ball more,” said Sal-
oky, “any back wants to run with
the ball. But I was happy just
blockingthem. As long as I’m in
there and helping, I'm happy.”

With Carroll due back for Fri-
day afternoon’s clash with the
Ohio State frosh, Saloky will most
likely be back in his role as a
“Jungle Cat.” But Kokor now
knows that he has depth in the
backfield, particularly in Willie
Saloky.

“I didn’t know I was going to
be plaving tail back until Joe
(Carroll) got hurt-,”. said the walk-
on, “but I know all the tailback
plays. It didn’t affect my play
any.” -

. Saloky just might see plenty ‘ -— .
of action again Friday night, and

 

the team in disgust. An athlete does not quit be-
cause a team is having a poor season. He merely

' tries harder. An athlete does quit however, when he
realizes that a team has the potential, but that it is
not being properly exploited.

It all comes right down to Leo Bemis. He has
been coaching at Pitt for fifteen years, and the last

three seasons have been disastrous. The future
looks bleak. All of the players respect him, but not
as a coach. Many realize the. futility in playing un-
der him, and are seriously considering the possi-
bility of not coming out for the team next season.
They have no confidence in hisgcoaching ability
, and feel that they’re just Wasting their time.

Soccer definitely needs help from somewhere.
(As it is, the University only gives out two scholar-
ships). I. feel that it is time that the Athletic De-
partment finishes cleaning house, and brings in a
young, ambitious coach. (as they have done for
track, swimming, wrestling, basketball, and foot-
ball). With the schedule that the soccer team plays
the team nees all the help that it can get! How
about a new coach for openers‘?

ferences between the two teams
was the running of the Notre
Dame backs. “Their backs ran
like it was the last time that
they would carry the ball,” said
defensive back Charlie Hall.

Hart also agreed with that and
added, “Those backs put out for
the extra yardage. They are more
concerned about gaining that ex-
tra yardage than anything else.
They run like their jobs are at
stake.”

The only bright note offensi-,

vely for the Panthers was that
they were finally able to score
against the Irish.- Theirfirst score
in three years against Notre
Dame came on an eleven yard
toss from quarterback Dave Ha-
vern to wingback Joe McCain,
after recovering a Notre Dame

-- fumble of a punt, three plays be-

fore.

Two players which were able
to shine through the gloom of an-
other Pitt slaughter were sopho-
more Hall and punter Joe ‘Spicko.
“Charlie had his best football game
so far,” commented Hart. “I never
saw him hit so hard.” Hall was
credited with 15 tackles, an ex-
tremely high total for a defensive
halfback.

being called upon to punt eight
times, many of those coming un-
der a strong rush for the huge
Irish linemen. For his. efforts,
Spicko managed‘ a 44-yard aver-
age and boomed his longest punt
of this year, a 66-yard drive.

Injuries continue to mount "up
once again; this time starting de-
fensive tackle Bruce Harkiew-
icz became lost for the season,
the twelfth player since fall
camp to be lost for theseason.

And now that Miami and Notre
Dame are passed, all Hart has
to look forward to is Army and
Penn State. Chances for another
1-9 season look good.

 

“TAILBACK WILLIE Saloky (43) didn’t carry the ball many times

against the Penn State frosh Friday night, butwhen he did, he aver-
aged 4.2 yards ‘a carry. Actually, the 6-1, 195 pound halfback is at-

tending Pitt on a wrestling scholarship.

Hawks Challenge Cowards
But Receive N 0 Reply???

  ' byNYTONE E. LYON

The «Penn State “Collegian Cowards’-’ are truly cowards.

Two weeks ago, Hawk‘ coach Roy “Jumpshot” Jacobs, sent
Penn [State Daily Collegian Sports Editor, Ron Kolb, a letter

challenging the Cowards to a football game with the incredi-
ble Hawks. But two weeks has gone by and there has been no

reply.

“We want to renew an old rivalry,” said “Jumpshot,” bewildered .

at the “Cowards” cowardice. “I guess we’ve gotten too tough for

them.”

The Cowards are not the first team not to meet the Hawks chal-
lenge. The hapless Pittsburgh Steelers and the Ted Mack Amateurs
have also found excuses not to face the powerful Hawks.

’ As a result, this year’s undefeated Hawks will. most probably
continue playing their unusually weak schedule. This Sunday, they

will be afterwin number four, against the~0_wls’.  V
