Many SGB election promises left unfulfilled by members

By Scot Ross and

David T. Welch
T be Pitt News

With the present Student Government
Board’s year in office almost completed,
several board member have been unable
to fulfill the campaign promises they made
last November.

Board member Craig Williams said that
it is difficult to determine before the election
the validity of campaign promises.

“You sort of have to know the person,”
Williams said. “As the campaign is now, I
don’t know if the students actually get to
know the people. Are these people really
motivated? Are they really going to go
after what they say they are going to do?

“I’d say the board is split sort of 50-50
right now of people who actually get stuff
done, do good on their promises. It
depends on the person,” Williams said,
adding that he did see inactivity on the
part of some board members.

“I’ve seen in the last year that some
people are using it as a résumé builder or
a popularity contest,“ he said.

Williams said he saw a responsibility
between the SGB president and board

members to keep each other motivated.

“But once you’re voted, you’re on there
 Once you’re one there, there’s really
nothing you can do: You could sit back
and not do anything the whole year,”
Williams said.

Board member Kristen Wesolowski said
some campaign goals are unattainable.

“As for any election, all campaign
promises aren't [kept.]. They look good.
They sound good, and that’s why you get
your vote, but once you look into them it’s
tough because you realize that some of
them are unattainable,” Wesolowski said.

O O O

Wesolowski said that some of her
campaign promises fell under the auspices
of other members’ year—long projects.

One of Wesolowski’s main concerns
was “developing a more intense campus-
safety program.” But she said she has little
to do with the current “Crime Stop”
program.

“[SGB members Chad Wertz and Andy
Gould] just took on the safety committee.
They had the committee structured in
their way, and I let them work with that,”
Wesolowski said.

Wesolowski also wanted to combat

tensions created by racism, sexism and
homophobia on campus but left this to
Pitt’s freshman—studies program.

“They added the cultural-diversity
program into freshman studies. That helps
freshman students adjust to problems on
campus,” Wesolowski said.

One of her major promises was to
improve student housing both on— and
off—campus. While the university began
construction on a new dorm, Wesolowski
said she and SGB had little to do with it,
except “[SGB President] Brent [Saunders]
was involved in the planning,” she said.

As far as off—campus students are
concerned, Wesolowski said, “with off-
campus housing problems, like problems
with landlords, we’ve been referring them
to a lawyer.” Wesolowski said she worked
last spring on getting local landlords to
push their lease dates back to facilitate the
school terms. At that time, she found that

it was not feasible to start because students :
long project became working on senate

for the most part had already signed their
leases for the upcoming term.

According to Wesolowski, her major
undertaking has been the restructuring of
the senate committees. Senate committees
are composed of faculty, administrative

personnel and two students, but in the
past student representatives have not been
reliable, according to Wesolowski.

“By interviewing we made sure we got
good candidates and had a meeting so that
everyone knew what they were getting
into. And I pretty much keep up on them,”
Wesolowski said.

Wesolowski said students are attending
the senate committees and they are
returning information that they get at the
meetings.

SGB’s Brock Hamula said during his
campaign that he wanted to extend the
campus—shuttle service to the Victoria
Building, create a crime watch, publish a
student guide to off—campus housing, offer
protection seminars, enforce mandatory
teacher evaluations, have a more liberal
visitation policy for residence halls and
better racial relations on campus.

Hamula said that after election his year-

Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor has eliminated two
administrative positions in an
attempt to make academics the
“driving mission” of the university.

The positions eliminated last
week were vice president of
administration, held by John
Yeager, and vice president of
finance, held by Edward
Hunia.

The changes are the start of
O’Connor’s reorganization of the
university.

“I am making these changes in
my continuing attempt to bring
the organization into a reflection
of my philosophy that the
academic mission drives the

administration of the institution,”

O’Connor said.
The elimination will change

the way the university’s budget is '

formulated, according to
university spokesperson Tim
Ziaukas.

In the past the administration’s
budget office would make
budgetary recommendations to
the president, who would
approve the annual budget.

Under the new plan, the
provost’s office is going to make
the budgetary recommendations
to the president.

“This gives the academic side

more budgetary input and puts
the budget office in a support
role,” Ziaukas said..

The eliminations were not a
reflection of Hunia’s or Yeager’s
performance, according to
Ziaukas.

The changes have nothing to
do with recent allegations of fiscal
impropriety in the university
administration, according to
Ziaukas.

Yeager and Hunia could not be
reached for comment.

Both Hunia and Yeager will
retain positions at the university.
Hunia, who served as treasurer
while working as vice president
of finance, will retain the treasurer
position. Yeager will hold a
tenured professor’s position in
the School of Education.

The absence of the two
positions will not affect the
departments that formerly
reported to the two vice
presidents, according to Ziaukas.

Those departments will now
report to the office of the senior
vice president for budget and
finance, aposition that is being
jointly run temporarily by
Executive Assistant Provost for
Budget and Finance Robert
Dunkelman and Health Sciences
Senior Vice President Jeffrey
Romoff. The university is currently
searching for a permanent
replacement for that post.

Symposium explores aristocratic inﬂuence orz cm‘

By Mike Laughlin
For he Pitt News

The theme of the ﬁfth annual
Symposium on Medieval and
Renaissance Studies focused on
the patronage of artists by the

_royal, aristocratic and common
' families of Europe during the

Medieval and Renaissance eras.
~The symposium, which was
held in the Frick Fine Arts Building
Friday and Saturday, attracted
professors of various subjects,
graduate students and art scholars
from Pennsylvania and other

“ states.

“It’s a useful mix with other
disciplines, and it pulls together
other Pennsylvania scholars,
which is very rare,” said Frank
Toker, an art historian with the
Pitt ﬁne-arts department.

The symposium featured panel
discussions, speakers and slide
shows.

_ Saturday’s keynote speaker was .
Ellen Callmann, an art professor

from Muhlenberg College. She
discussed “Patrons and Painters

in Early Renaissance Florence.”
Callmann talked about the
social structure of Florence, Italy,
which was the largest city in
Europe during the Renaissance
Era. She explained how Florence
was ruled by bankers and
merchants, who were major
patrons of the renaissance artists,
and how these merchants and
bankers influenced works of art.
Callmann showed slides of their
works and’ gave a brief
explanation or history for each
one. She also pointed out that art
was consumed by many of
Florence’s citizens at that time
and not just by the mling class.
The first panel discussions
covered such topics as “Musical
Patronage at Savoy, 1420-1450,”
by Robert Bradley of the City

University of New York andl

“Patron as Pupil: On Becoming
the Duke of Burgundy,” by Jesse
D. Hurlbut of the University of
Kentucky. '

A later panel discussion
concentrated on the influence of
kings and aristocrats on artists

and the conditionsartists worked
under. The lectures also
mentioned the social status of
artists who were patronized by
kings. The speakers discussed
subjects dealing with politics and
its impact on patronage in
medieval England.

Two shopkeepers set up display
stands.Dmitry Wieber of Historic
Waxcraft had several tables laid
out with replicas of historic seals
made from wax. These seals
were used by medieval and
renaissance kings and aristocrats
to sign important documents by
stamping them with their seals or
attaching the seals to the

which were used for veneration
purposes by medieval churches.

Frank Carroll of City Books
stood by a display which was
laden with books on medieval
and -renaissance history.

something like this at a university.

year at other cities, but this is my

David Wilkins, chairperson of
Pitt’s ﬁne—arts department and a
member of the symposium’s
steering committee, said he felt
the symposium had gone very
well. _

Wilkins said he was impressed
with the high quality of the
speakers and felt it was a good
experience for the graduate

_ students who attended.‘

“The [lectures] have been of
extraordinary quality,” said Dr.
Barbara Sargent Baur, who
attended the symposium.

“Excellent. No second-rate
speakers. The committee did an
excellent job of choosing,” said
Sumner Williard, a retired
professor from West Point
Academy, who also attended.

Other people enjoyed the
symposium because of the Frick
Fine Arts Building.

“It _really helps to have a
conference in a beautiful building,
and this building is ideal,” said
Joanna Thornton, the conference
coordinator.

Greek Week
preparations
begin early

By Arthur Graziani
Stajf Writer

Preparations for Greek Week
1992 are underway, as
Chairpersons Kim Fercioni and
Reid Sadler have named the
UnitedCerebralPalsyAssociati.on
the official charity of this year’s
event

UCPA is a non-profit
organization that helps people
with disabilities caused by brain
damage during pregnancy or
shortly after birth.

“We wanted to find a charity
that had national recognition but
still played a role in the
community,” Sadler said. “we also
needed an organization that we
could become actively involved
with. We think we have made the
right choice.”

The charity work will begin

Nov. 18, when Pitt Greeks will ’

help raise money through a
phone—a—thon. For three days
volunteers will be on the phones,
trying to get donations for UCPA.

“We also will be helping with

the national telethon planned in
January,” Sadler said. “with this
we hope to draw attention to the
charity and its work for the local
community and our assistance.”

Mariam May, director of
development and public relations
for the UCPA’s local chapter, said
she is very pleased with the
assistance from the Pitt Greeks.

“Of course we welcome the
fund raising, but we are very
proud of the volunteering,” she
said.

Sadler said he hopes the whole
Pitt community will realize that
people who suffer from cerebral
palsy are not any less capable
than anyone else.“We would like
the whole student body to get

‘ involved in our volunteer work.

These people are just like us, and
that is the way they want to be
treated.”

Administrative positions are
nothing new for recently
appointed philosophy
department chairperson Rudolph
Weingartner.

Weingartner has headed a
philosophy department twice
before —-— at San Francisco State
College and at Vassar College.
Weingartner came to Pitt as the
provost in 1987 from
Northwestern University, where
he was clean of the college of arts
and sciences.

Weingartner resigned his post
as provost in 1989, when he and
former Pitt President Wesley
Posvar had a dispute over
 budgetary matters.

“lt’s an absolutely outstanding
department,” he said of the
philosophy department.
v Weingartner said his main goal
as maintaining its level of quality.

outstanding graduate students

have to maintain our outstanding
faculty. I feel it’s vitally important
to recruit and maintain minority
faculty. It’s extremely difficult to
find and identify and recruit min-

He also talked about the
undergraduate student body,
which take philosophy classes as
general education requirements,
and how qualified teaching

the understanding of information
offered in large lecture classes.

“Much. attention is paid to

parts of an undergraduate

I find impressive is that, after a

got started, so we just handed it over to the
safety committee,” Hamula said.

Hamula said he directed representatives
of the senate committees to find out about
minority issues in their committee meetings.

“When you bring up racial tensions,
there's not really a project you can do. All
you can do is hope that something like the
Black Action Society will start a project or
something that we can support, or we can
deal with allocations, if they ask for so
much money and if we feel that it’s going
to be something that BAS is doing or
another minority group or club is starting
to do, then we can be there in support of
it,” Hamula said. “I don’tsee it as something
that we can come in and say, ‘OK, let’s
start a project to wipe out racial tensions.’
It’s something you just kind of have to
support the other groups Iwithl.”

Hamula said that SGB can take initiative
on these issues “on a small scale. As far as
a large scale project, it’s hard because we
don’t really know a lot about it. We have
to refer on other organizations and other
groups that do, and they can see the
problem. I know there are racial tensions,
and I’d like something to be done about it.
“But I can’t see any direct problem because
I’m not having the problem. When another

appointments, Hamula said. The senate
has 14 committees to which SGB appoints
two students per committee.

Hamula was not directly responsible for
any change in the visitation policies in the
dorm, but he said that he attended a
meeting about the maid service in the
dorms and was able to help it continue.

_Hamula said of his campaign promises,
“Everything on there I think has been
covered in some way. When people make
campaign promises, I guess people want
a response right away and they want to
see it done, but everything on there has
been touched upon and worked upon
and, I think, improved.”

Hamula said voters need to look at a
candidate’s qualifications in determining
the validity of campaign promises.

“What [voters in the upcoming SGB
election] need to look at is what the
student is involved in and how they’ve
done. The speeches are great, but take
them with a grain of salt,” He said.

“When you first get up here it’s great
because you look at your list of promises
and the first month you’re up here you
want to do as much as you can, but once
you’re here you see that you can’t, a lot of
it’s really hard to do," Hamula said. “So
don’t go as much by the direct words of

what they’re saying, but look at who the
person is and what they have done and if
they are a good leader and you can trust
them."

In his campaign lastyear, Craig Williams
said he wanted to work on computer-lab
expansion and a computer operation guide
for the labs “in layman's terms.” .

Williams said he met with Sharon Swaney
from Computing and Information Services
at Pitt and found that “there are a lot of
people that have problems with the
computer labs; they just don’t voice their
opinions.”

Williams created a survey for students to
voice their opinions about the computer
labs. He said that he has had several
meetings with the directors of the
computing labs about the results of the
survey. ,

One of the survey’s findings was that
students are interested in getting a lab in
North Oakland. Space limitations prevent
this at the present time, Williams ‘said.

Williams said he originally wanted to
work towards the creation of a seminar for
new students’ explaining the computer-

accounts system. After taking this proposal

Williams said they are in the
process of exploring a campus-
wide program to orient all
students to the system.

Many times the development

of projects like this is hindered by
communication problems,
Williams said. He said “playing
phone tag” is one setback to
project completion.

Board members also have to
discern the real necessity of a
service, Williams said.

After speaking with Public

Safety Director William Brennan
about setting up a North Oakland
shuttle, the SGB surveyed students
for their input on the shuttle.
“Most of the stuff that came
back was like, ‘We could use a

North Oakland shuttle because-

we want to get a ride to North
Oakland for parties on Friday
night,”’ Williams said.

“You can't take this to Director

Brennan and say, ‘Well, I think
you should spend $40,000 on a

shuttle service’ when students‘

just want it for partying," Williams
said.

Additional promises that

Williams made were about
extending choice dollars and
having a vegetarian menu in the
cafeteria.
Williams said that choice dollars
- and food service were projects
given to board member Njugi
Nginyo.

' Gil Golden listed accountability
and student representation as his
most important goals. When
Representative Student Council
failed as a representative body,
the SGB created the president’s
council, which Golden helped
organize- __

“We spent a lot of money, and
I spent a lot of time to make RSC
work. It would function kind of
on its own as a recommending
body. It was open to anybody. If
they had anything they wanted to
see done, we could act on it. So
after spending a fortune in
mailings and Pitt News ads,
hardly anyone showed up,”,
Golden said. ‘

The president’s council. consists
of Brent Saunders, Golden and.
presidents of the
governance ‘groups: Inter-
Fraternity Council, Panhellenic
Council, Engineering Student
Council, Nursing Student
Association, Black Action Society,
Student Honors Academic
Committee and the Student
Council of Pharmacy.

“If anyone from any other
student organization [wants to
join], then by all means, the door

‘is always open,” Golden said.

Golden also promised a
ﬁnancial-aid committee and a
student course-advisory guide.

The course-advisory guide will
rate professors and courses based
on student evaluation. The guide
is still in the making, Golden
said. V

Golden said he made “good
progress” on this project last
summer, gathering information
from other universities on the
pros and cons.

“I had a meeting with ICAS
Dean Mary] Briscoe, Dr. Jack
Daniel, who is assistant to the
provost, and Director of the Office

of Evaluation and Measurement
Carol Baker, but the meeting was
canned because [Pitt President J.
Dehnisl O’Connor called them in
for a meeting, and it was
temporarily postponed,” Golden
said. '

“I met with Baker and Dr. Daniel
over the summer, and both were
excited to talk to me. We may not
be able get a guide with all the
information we need, but we
may be able to expand on the
existing course guide. The
professor and course [guide] are
more controversial. It could take
years. But there’s support. The
students want it. Dean Briscoe
and Dr. Daniel want to help,”
Golden said.

Golden also created the
academic-affairs committee and
said he organized it differently
than nprmal committees by

soliciting potential representatives
from different areas of the
university rather than through
advertisements. Golden said there
are currently 15 members on the
committee, which meets weekly
and develops its own projects to
work on.

“Its members were selected by
department chairs or department
members. We have a real
committee up here that can look
into these issues far better than I
can, and they are qualified, too.
The financial—aid committee
would fall under the academic-
affairs committee. I’m expecting
the course-guide book to really
take off now that we have these
15 people,” Golden said.

Golden also made
arrangements to have the William
Pitt Union concourse area opened
longer for study hoursl

“It’s not great, but it’s got lots of
tables [and] water fountains, and
the security is excellent," Golden
said. ‘

Golden said the candidates who
campaign with an actual plan of
attack as opposed to numerous
campaign promises are more
likely to fulfill their promises.

_ “Some people stand up there
and can rattle off 600 things that
they’re going to change or
improve upon, and other people
stand up there and say this is how
I'm going to change this, not just,
rattling off a list of things,” Golden
saiql.

“Who's going to control what
gets done- if you don’t have a
motivated board? The students
need to be concerned,” Golden
said.

Erin Rodgers promised to open

the Student Health Service on
weekends and "move it
somewhere with more space.
Neither of these goals could be
accomplished, according to
Rodgers.

“I spoke to [Student Health’,
Director] Franklin Carter, and he

explained to me why it was so
expensive [to have services on
weekends]. Students will have to
go to the hospital, and campus
police will take them. The cost
will have to be paid by the
students. Student Health could
not afford to pay the hospitals.
They would have to raise our fee
considerably,” Rodgers said.
Carter said that he can only

recall speaking to Brent Saunders ‘

about the Student Health Service

this past year. He said that if any

requests had been made about

weekend visitation,’ those
requests would have been
brought to his attention.
However according to the SGB
minutes from the Jan. 16, 1991
meeting, Rodgers reported that

‘she met with Carter on Jan. 11.

She said they “discussed the
publication of the weekend-
service policy." There was no
mention of any attempt to alter
the lack of weekend SHS hours.

Rodgers’ efforts to relocate
Student Health also met its
obstacles. “Basically Student
Health is against the wall with
Facilities Management. There are
a lot of space problems on this
campus. [Carter] wants it as much
as students do, but he realizesif
the university does not give him

“ the space  then I can completely

understand,” Rodgers said.
Rodgers promised to expand
the Pitt Taxi service and have the

shuttle extend its route to Lothrop ,

Hall and the Victoria Building.
“Last year I had the Pitt Taxi

extended from a cab to a van. It

was intended to be just weekends,

but the company said that it is
easier to do it all week,” she said.

The shuttle has extended its
route to Lothrop and the Victoria,
but according to Rodgers, she did
not arrange that. “Brock lHamulal

did that; it was just a phone call,” ‘

Rodgers said. .

“I also coordinated the shuttle
for the basketball games. The
shuttle goes up to the [Fitzgerald]
Field House, but you have to
walk back down. It was very
expensive to run, and it’s not that
hard to walk down the hill. The
shuttle goes both ways for the
Civic Arena games,” Rodgers said.

Rodgers was also responsible
for organizing the Student
Recognition Reception to increase
student participation on campus.

According the minutes of the
weekly SGB meetings from Feb.

.6 to April 10, Rodgers’ reports to

the board consisted primarily of
the progress of the banquet’s
preparations.

“It was opened to all student
groups. It was held last April 8 in
the William Pitt Union. About 200
people were there. I would say

maybe 20 to 30 student groups
were represented,” Rodgers said.
According to Rodgers, there are
about 250 student groups at Pitt.
Rodgers said she helped get
student passes for the Carnegie
Museum. “I had to get in touch
with Carnegie, and we purchased
3,700 passes for the students.
They are good until June 30,
1992. We have them in the office,
and they are free to non-CGS
undergrads. CGS is not included
because they have their own
finances,” Rodgers said.
According to Carnegie Assistant
Director Celeste Banks, SGB
President Brent Saunders and
Student Affairs Director William

. Harmon organized the program.

“We spoke with Brent Saunders
and Bill Harmon. They met with
[Director Doris Carson Williams]
and put the program together.
Erin Rodgers is the person who
actually picked up the passes,
and she is the individual who we

will be working with on an

ongoing- basis if there are any
problems,” Banks said.

Njugi Nginyo promised to
increase student representation
on the board but said that Gil
Golden headed that project. “Gil
took that one. The groups we ren’t
showing up [at meetings]. I didn’t
work on these things personally,”
Nginyo said.

Nginyo also promised to try to
setup workshops for all academic
disciplines, but that “never
became a priority of the board,”
Nginyo said.

Nginyo wanted to have all
foreign teaching assistants take a
language exam, which is now

required, but Nginyo said that '

the action was not initiated by the
board. “As soon as I started talking
about that, different academic
departments started working on
that,” Nginyo said.

Being accessible to students
was something Nginyo stressed
as important. He said the bulletin
board was the major means of
fulﬁlling that promise.

“We're putting a big bulletin
board in the [Litchfieldl Towers

pg that will be placed in five to six

weeks,” Nginyo said. But

according to Saunders, he
organized that project with Chad
Wertz. “lChad] drew up the plans.
He started it, and I finished it,"
Saunders said. V

“We have suggestion boxes,
but I found by just being out [on
campus] I could get -more
suggestions,” Nginyo said.

Each board member
represented a different
governance group. Nginyo
represented the BAS. “I'm the
liaison with the BAS. That's
probably where I was represented
best,” Nginyo said. ,

BAS President Marta Effinger
said BAS representation on SGB
was not what she would have
liked. “In reference to our liaison,
he didn't attend regularly,”
Effinger said.

Like Rodgers, Nginyo wanted
to give Student Health Services
some more space. “I talked to
Student Health. They said that
when the new dorm is in they
will expand to the second ﬂoor
of Brackenridge, butby no means
of mine,” Nginyo said.

Also like Rodgers, Nginyo’s
efforts were unseen by SHS
Director Franklin Carter, who said
that he did,not speak to either
board member about these
projects and if there had been the
serious‘ possibility of moving
Student Health Service, the
proposal would have also gone
through him. I

Nginyo said his main project

was the expansion of Choice.

Dollars. “Choice Dollars is my
baby. We talked to Food and
Housing to see if we could expand
choice dollars. We basically ran
into a brick wall. Choice Dollars
was, for me, a failure,” Nginyo
said.

Improved campus safety is one
promise Andrew Gould made
when he ran for office last
November. According to Gould,

Continued from page 6
the Crime Stop program is how
he fulfilled that promise.

The program is a
communication network through
which resident directors of
residence halls can relay
information from the Department
of Public Safety to resident

assistants, who can then give the '

information to students. The
system can work in reverse as
well. Students can report crime
information to the campus police
in the same manner.

The program earned Gould the
Governor’s Citizen Crime
Prevention Volunteer Recognition
Award. Pitt Public Safety Director
William Brennan nominated
Gould for the award.

“Every year police chiefs from
around the state can nominate
someone who they believe has
done something remarkable in

- crime prevention. WhatAndy did

was bang on doors to get people
involved. At one point he released
a survey to see how many students
were aware of a crime-watch
program, and 65 percent said
they were aware of it,” Brennan
said.

The program does not,
however, include the residential
areas of Oakland. “We are

working with [Executive Director ‘

of the South Oakland Citizen’s
Council] Pat Scanlon. We’re trying
to get a similar network off-
campus, but there is a gap
between the permanent residents
in South Oakland. The South
Oakland Citizen’s'Council wants
to work with us, but the
permanent residents don’t,”
Gould said.

Scanlon said that a South
Oakland‘crime'—watch is still in
the making and the student
residents are not cooperating.
“Everything takes time. You just
have to keep plugging away at it.
We held a meeting in the evening,
and a lot of residents are older
and did notwant to come out in
the evening  Several residents
came, but the students did not
come out,” Scanlon said.

Scanlon said she does not
believe that there is a problem
between the students and the
permanent residents. “That’s
absolutely not true. There is no
conﬂict,” Scanlon said.

Gould also aimed at greater
communicationbetweenstudents
and administration. By starting its
own programs, SGB has earned
the cooperation of administration,
according to Gould.

“We pulled in other avenues
by creating other programs and

' got [the administration] interested.

I did my part by initiating [Crime
Stop], and the administration came
to me. Communication has been
good. On October 28, President
U. Dennis] O’Connor, Director of
Student Affairs William Harmon
and Provost Donald Henderson
will be at a question-and-answer

type thing for the students,” Gould

said.

Expansion of residence halls

on campus was another one of
Gould’s promises, and while SGB

had nothing to do with initiating .
M the Construction of the new dorm

Gould said he was involved in
the planning.

“They wanted to know what _

type of cafeteria, parking lots and
rooms they should build, and
they let me be in on the

‘committee. I like to think SGB

had some influence,” Gould said.

Gould promised to_ try to
eliminate apathy and racism on
campus. “They are things that are
always going to be on campus.
We have quintupled Freshman

Council. They have members who _

are interns for us. That helps us
get people involved in SGB.
Judicial Board has the most
members ever. I was very
surprised to see only 10 people
running for board. Apathy is
always going to be here. That’s a
fact of life, but you can try to
improve it, and I think we have,”
Gould said.

“As for racism, SGB has always
listened to the Black Action Soc-
iety and other groups that have
been bothered. We're always here

_ to help, but doing what you can

is not always enough,” he said.
O O 0
Like Andrew Gould, Chad
Wertz promised to increase safety
on campus. He is starting a Public

Safety Committee for that
purpose.

“Basically that is about 14
people. It’s broken into different

- projects or teams. There are

people working with Andy Gould
on Crime Stop, and last year we
did research for a campus—safety
guide,” Wertz said. The guide has
not yet been completed,
according to Wertz. _

“We plan on releasing it next
year. It’s a long—term thing. We’re
trying to combine everything that
is passed out at freshman
orientation. It’s designed for
freshmen, so we want to put it
out next year,” Wertz said.

Wertz said that Andy Gould
has done most of the work for
campus safety.

“I’ve worked with Andy Gould.
I haven’t done a whole lot because
Andy took it by storm,” Wertz
said. «
Wertz wanted to eliminate
apathy on campus. The main
project is a bulletin board which
will publicize student activities,
according to Wertz. “Just trying
to get more people involved is

the hardest thing to do at Pitt. The
bulletin board is supposed to be
completed within four weeks.
The idea is to advertise SGB
events and projects. It is triangle-
shaped, with one side for SGB
and the other side is for other
groups. The purpose is to attract
people to any activities that are
available,” Wertz said.

Wertz also wanted to extend
campus-shuttle service. This
future project has been delegated
to the public-safety committee,
according to Wertz. “First, we
have to poll the students to see if
it is needed. That’s the first goal
of the public-safety committee,”
Wertz said.

In addition, Wertz promised to
publish a pamphlet describing
shuttle hours. “That was already
‘done by [former freshman council
chairperson] Jacob Brody. It is a
yellow sheet describing shuttle
and bus routes,” Wertz said.

Wertz promised to have SGB
sponsor more student activities
and fairs, but he admits that was
out of his hands. “Pitt Program
Council is responsible for that.

That may have been my error at
that time. It really wasn’t in our
authority to do that. That’s more
PPC’s line of work,” Wertz said.

According to Wertz, his main ' 1

responsibility has been taking
care of’ SGB finances. _“I

maintained the budget. I did all . A_
the paperwork and designed this . »
year’s budget. It’s really a time- ‘ "

consuming thing,” Wertz said.

SGB President Brent Saunders‘

summed up the work of his board.
“I think everyone shined in their
area. Andy Gould made Crime
Stop into a real,~solid program.
Chad Wertz did an amazing job

as business manager. A f "

“Obviously Gil Golden did a
lot of work. He put together the
academic-affairs committee. It’s
really hard to say. Erin Rodgers
has put together a lot of our
banquets, and Craig Williams has
done well with the computer
projects.

The old adage “promises are

. made to be broken” has sadly

become the theme which stuck
in the minds of this year’s Student
Government Board members, as
they acted upon their campaign
promises of last November.
Each member made many

campaign promises that went“

unfulfilled. In fact, SGB member
Brock Hamula told TbePittNews,
“The speeches are great, but take
them with a grain of salt.”

The only member who didn't
follow this policy‘ was now-

. presidential candidate Gil Golden.

After it was determined that the
Representative Student Council
did not represent students,
Golden created another
committee, the president’s
council, which accepted the

‘ responsibility the RSC could not

deliver. He also succeeded in
keeping the William Pitt Union
concourse area open for longer

. hours to provide a study lounge

for Pitt students.

For these improvements,
Golden deserves an A.

Other members of the SGB

.. should have taken the initiative

that Golden did concerning
student relations. However that
is only a pipe dream.

Andrew Gould, who scored 21
C+ for his performance as a

. member, was commended earlier

this year for his work on Crime
Stop. The communication
network was the one promise
Gould kept to the university

' community. The one drawback

was that if you’re not on campus,
Crime Stop isn't going to help

~- you.

Granted Pitt has no jurisdiction
off-campus, but students don’t
move to Oakland for its historic
splendor: They move here

‘ because they attend Pitt. If Gould

really wanted to help students be

, more aware of crime, he would

have found a way to extend Crime
Stop off-campus or at least be an
adamant critic of the withholding
of campus-police reports.

Last November, he also
promised to expand on—campus
housing. However he ‘admitted
to The Pitt News that he had
nothing to do with the
construction of the new dorm on

Unkept promises typifypeifforhmttce of isyear’s SGB

EDITORIAL

the hill. As for eliminating apathy
and racism on campus, Gould
also said there wasn’t much he
could do.

Craig Williams, too, receives a
C+. Williams, unlike the four
members who were given failing
grades, managed to show some
sign of a pulse with his work on
improving Pitt’s computer
services. Williams cannot be
blamed for campus apathy, and
though his work was not overly
extensive,- he has proven that it is
possible to be elected into ofﬁce
and still attempt to keep a
promise.

Chad Wertz did attempt several
projects to improve student life,
so he merits a D+. As business
manager, one of Wertz’s main
responsibilities was to plan the
SGB budget. What that amounts
to basically is planning how many
ads will run in The Pitt News and
how much that will cost. Not
exactly the most time-consuming
job, but he did show signs of
responsibility. Wettz, however,
did not accomplish much, nor
did he keep any of his promises.

Kristen Wesolowski, Erin
Rodgers, Njugi N ginyo and Brock
Hamula didn't fare as well. When
hooked up to our Pitt News
Responsibility EKG, each of these
members registered a flatline. A

Wesolowski spent her entire
term working on senate
committees. Throughout the
minutes of the SGB meetings,
Wesolowski assured students that
compact discs are definitely a
better investment that LPs—- at
least they don't skip and repeat
the same thing over and over
again.

Out of 15 meetings, she
mentioned her involvement with
the implementation of the senate
committee eight times —— a job
which, if handled in an organized
manner, could have been
completed in two or three weeks.

Erin Rodgers, too, showed no
signs of life on our EKG. Besides
performing such menial tasks as
placing ads in The Pitt News and
spending office hours in Telefact,

Rodgers spent her year organizing
the Student Leadership
Recognition Dinner.

A For all those interested in taking
a class on procrastination ta_ught
by Professor Rodgers, the
following is "an example of what
your syllabus might consist of:

Feb. 13 — Spend a week setting

"a date for the SLRD.

Feb. 20 — Somehow manage to
muster the energy to write letters
to all student organizations on
campus. '

d March 13 — Plan to pick up
invitations for SLRD  next week.

March 20 — Remind SGB
members of the SLRD and
encourage them to attend.

March 27 — Order food for the
reception.

April 3 - Finalize plans, order
pretty flowers, expect final
decisions on award recipients --
someone else’s responsibility, of
course. —

April 10 — Remember to tell
everyone the time-consuming
reception went well. ’

Well, at least Rodgers proved
she had a voice with which to
report these accomplishments,
unlike Njugi'Nginyo, who was
the liaison between the SGB and
the Black Action Society. Marta
Efﬁnger, president of the BAS,
described Nginyo’s actions with
herorganization: “In reference to
our liaison, he didn’t attend
[meetings] regularly.”

Apparently, this liaison’s voice
box, his ability to attend meetings
and his research before the
elections were insufficient.

Nginyo promised Pitt students

that he would organize a program
which would require teaching

. assistants to undergo language

exams to prove their competence.
He must have been disappointed
to discover that Pitt took that
matter into its own hands —

before he got a chance to follow '

through. Perhaps future S_GB
candidates should be exposed to
InfoTrac exams to prove their
competence at researching the
history of their speeches.

With one phone call to Franklin
Carter, director of Pitt’s Student
Health Service, ‘Nginyo would
have found out that the relocation
of Student Health from
Brackenridge Hall to the loading
dock of the Towers would have
been ‘impossible. However he
did not make ‘a call, and he went
on to promise this “beneficial”
move to the students.

Brock Hamula’s only crowning

achievement of the year came a

few weeks ago, when he was
named homecoming king.
Hamula said, “When you first get
up here it's great because you
look at your list of promises, and
the first month you’re up here
you want to do as much as you
can, but once you’re here you see
that you can’t. A lot of it's really
hard to do." ,

Hamula’s platform included an
extensive list of promises, most
of which became (or were
supposed to become) other board
members’ projects. He was part
of the necessary two—person
senate-committee appointment
tandem.

One valiant effort of the SGB

members was the implementing
of a_ bulletin board, which will be
hung outside the Litchfield
Towers ‘sometime in November.
When asked, most members
seemed happy to report that they
contributed to this new board.
SGB President Brent Saunders,
although he has no direct
authority over the members,

should have taken it upon himself 4%»

to comment on the progress,(or
rather, lack of progress) of the
members. Given the electoral
finality of SGB elections, Saunders
really had no authority of the
other members and as result could
not justifiably dole out
punishment toward any of the
board members he felt weren’t
acting in the best interests of
students. ,
Although the fiscal compen-
sation of SGB is minimal, as
elected members of the student
body, they have an inherent
responsibility to keep promises

they made en route to election. ,1

The lack ‘of responsibility
shown by the majority of SGB
members this past year is
ridiculous. It demeans the entire
concept of student elections as
well as the student body. A new
board will be voted on soon, and
maybe just once students will get
involved in the elections and keep
undeserving people from getting
on board.

Past, present and future SGB
members must learn that if they
are going to talk the talk of
campaign promises, they must
be prepared to walk the walk and
follow through on them.

Slashed

ECU swaslo bus/ales 24-23

By Robert Y. Mazur Jr.
Sports Editor

It seems that the team that
comes up with foam-rubber fan
regalia suddenly starts to win.

The Atlanta Braves and their
controversial “tomahawk chop”
are a case in point. Just look:
They made it to the seventh
game of the World Series. The
Braves are not the only team to
benefit from such fan props.

The East Carolina Pirates came
up with the idea for bright yellow
sabres and the “sabre slash" on
Saturday against the Panthers.
The luck of the Braves appeared
to wear off, as the Pirates rallied
for a one—point, 24-23 victory,
their first ever over Pitt.

At the outset of the game,
things appeared to be stacked
against the Panthers. A crowd of
36,000, the largest in Ficklen
Stadium history, was set to watch
their 5-1 Pirates. East Carolina
had returned home to a throng

Volleyball sweep

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

After a slow start in its first
match, the Pitt ‘volleyball team
rolled to 3-0 victories in all three
of its matches this weekend.

Mistakes, especially passing
errors, plagued the team early
against Syracuse (18-4, 5-2 in the
Big East), as the Orangewomen
took a 14-9 lead in the first game.
After digging out two game
points, Pitt slowly fought back.

Sophomore outside hitter Ann
Marie Lucanie had a tough dig
and kill on the last game point
Syracuse would get at 12-14. A

big hitting error by Annie Parisjen .

of the Orangewomen tied the
game, and Pitt eventually won it
16-14 on another Syracuse error.

The Panthers rolled in the
second game, 15-5, as Syracuse
seemed to fall apart. After a bit of
a late run by the Orangewomen,
Pitt won the_third game 15-10.

“We tipped them to, death,"
head coach Sue Woodstra said.
“They're the biggest team in the
country, with eight players at
least 6 foot, but they can’t play
defense. They started out playing
perimeter defense. When we
started tipping, they couldn’t
adjust at all.”

Pitt continued to find holes in
the middle of the Syracuse
defense, with off-speed shots
mixed in with some hard shots
from the outside hitters,
especially Lucanie. Lucanie had
an outstanding match with 18
kills, a .406 hitting percentage,
16 digs and some blistering shots.
Senior co-captains Sue
Zonneville and Dee MacAulay
each had nine digs to go along
with 17 and 10 kills respectively.
Both hit for extremely high

of fans a week earlier after its 23-
20 upset of the Syracuse
Orangemen in the Carrier Dome.
In that game, quarterback Jeff
Blake, a prolific passer with
tremendous running ability,
scrambled 45 yards for the winning
touchdown.

Blake came out and took charge
against Pitt. After the opening
kickoff by Don Silvestri went out
of bounds, the Pirate offense took
the field at the 35. Blake moved
them down to the Pitt 11 in four
plays. After a pass to wideout
Clayton Driver took the ball to the
five, Blake dumped off a short
pass to an uncovered Hunter
Gallimore for the score. However
kicker Anthony Brenner’s extra-
point attempt sailed wide right,
his first miss in 26 tries this season.

The ensuing Panther drive
netted a gain of six yards. Pitt had
to punt, and Blake and the Pirates
got the ball back on their own
nine. They drove the ball to their
own 40 before Blake went deep

 

to receiver Dion Johnson. The
offering went overJohnson’s head
and was picked off by Steve
Israel, his sixth interception of
the year. Israel’s theft also was
only the second for Blake on the
year, breaking a string of 158
attempts without an interception.

The Panthers took the ball all
the way down to the ECU four
before running back Jermaine
Williams lost two yards on second
down and Alex Van Pelt’s pass to
Eric Seaman fell incomplete. With
4:06 remaining in the quarter,
kicker Don Silvestri hit a 23-yard
field goal, pulling Pitt within three.

After the Pirates took over at
their own 20, they escorted the
ball to midﬁeld before tailback
Cedric Van Buren fumbled and
Pitt’s Dave Coleman recovered at
the ECU 49. The Panthers were
able to get the ballto the Pirate 11
and elected to try for a 28-yard
field goal. Si1vestri’s kick sailed
wide of the posts, and the Pirates
took over at their own 20.

victory from Pant/oers

After a change of possessions,
the Pirates proceeded to move
the ball through the air on Pitt,
gaining 62 yards on six passes.
After a first-and-goal play at the
four lost three yards, Blake ran
the option to the leftside, pitching
to Van Buren at the last second.
Van Buren raced into the end

zone untouched, making the

score 13-3 with 3:06 remaining in
the half.

Pitt took the ball down to the
ECU 22 after a 44-yard lateral
pass to wide receiver Bill Davis.
After Williams lost one yard, the
Panthers settled for a 40-yard
Silvestri field goal.

The Panthers got the ball back
one more time before the half
and tried for another field goal..
However Silvestri’s 54-ygird
attempt was blocked and
recovered by Marc Washington
while time ran out with East
Carolina leading 13-6.

Prior to last Friday’s
seasomopening meet, Pitt's
women seniors handed out

"V yellow camations to first-

year swimmers and divers
in honor of their first
collegiate meet. The ﬂower
motif serves as an
appropriate segue to the
meet’s outcome, as the Pitt

0 Women's swimming and_
‘diving team held their

annual burial of inner-city
foe Duquesne at"l‘-rees Pool,
winning by a score of
135.50-95.50.

As expected, Pitt
dominated throughout the
meet. Getting early wins
were sophomore Jennifer
Burns (50-yard freestyle,
100-yard backstroke) and
juniorjill Comeau (200- and
4,00-yard freesqzle, 400-yard
freestyle relay). _

The Panthers swept
nearly every event, allowing
the Dukes only one top-
three finish (a first) through
the first nine events. At that

point, Pitt conceded the 2

remaining points to
Duquesne, and the rest of
the meettwas run as an

1- exhibition.

Women’s head coach

”,David Belowich wasn’-t

surprised at the outcome.
“As far as the scoring was

Pitt received the ball on its own
20. Pitt drove to the ECU 22 aided
bya defensive-holding call and a
24-yard, Van Pelt-to-Moore
completion. On fourth-and—one
from that spot, back Tim Colicchio
was stopped for no gain, and the
Pirates took over on downs.

On the next play, however,
Blake fumbled, and strong safety
Doug Whaley recovered on the
ECU 11. Four plays later, Williams
ran two yards into the end zone
to tie the score at 13 a side.

When the Pirates got the ball
back on their own 20, they wasted
little time moving it up field. On
the first play, Blake hit Fisher for
a 20-yard gain to the 40. Then he
hit Johnson for another seven.
On the next play, Johnson took
the pitch from Blake for 14 yards
to the Pitt 39. They settled for a
39-yard Brenner ﬁeld goal to make
the score 16-13.

Pitt regained control at its own
25, and Van Pelt led _the Panthers
down the ﬁeld through the air.
On second down from the ECU
15, cornerback Fred Walker
stepped in front of an errant pass
from Van Pelt and returned it to
the 50. However an offside call
on the defense negated the play.
Three plays later, Williams dove
through the middle to give the
Panthers a touchdown and a lead,
20-16, with 14:58 left in the game.

Both teams exchanged the ball
once. Then a Pirate drive stalled
at the ECU 42. They were forced
to punt after Blake was sacked
on second down by Keith
Hamilton. Van Pelt and Co. took
over at their own 15 and
proceeded to drive to the ECU
17. The drive ﬁzzled out after
Colicchio lost two yards on two
carries. Scott Kaplan hit a 35-yard
field goal, putting Pitt ahead 23-
16 with 3:22 to play.

Blake had to cover 80 yards in
just over three minutes. On first
down, Ricardo McDonald sacked
Blake for a seven-yard loss. On
the next play, a Blake-to-Daniels
pass went for no gain. On third

down, Blake scrambled away
from two defenders, finding
Gallimore for a 22-yard gain and
a first down. After an incomplete
pass and a six—yard gain by Blake,
a pass to Fisher lost one yard.
However a face-mask personal
foul on Pitt advanced the ball 15
yards for an automatic first down
at the Pitt 45. Blake then hit
Johnson for a 30-yard gain to the
15, then Gallimore for 14 yards to
the one. Blake ran the option left
and dove in for the score to make
it 23-22, Panthers.

The Pirates elected to go for
two points and the win with the
home fans standing and cheering
them on. Blake ran the option
right and went in for the two-
point conversion, putting East
Carolina up 24-23.

Pitt, however, was not done.
The Panthers took the kickoff at
the 20, and Van Pelt completed a
second—down pass for 19 yards.
After another incompletion, Van
Pelt hit Moore for nine yards.
After a third—down effort fell
incomplete, Van Pelt completed

a pass to Askew for 18 yards to 

the ECU 30 with :07 seconds left.
Instead of trying the 47-yard ﬁeld
goal, head coach Paul Hackett

‘and Van Pelt elected to try and

gain another five yards to make it
closer. However all the primary
receivers were covered, and Van
Pelt completed a pass to Askew
at the 10 to end the game.

“The strategy at the last set of
plays was to get close enough for
a field goal,” Hackett said.
“However the receivers were
covered, and Alex tried to win
the game. That’s what makes him
a great quarterback. You can’t
fault him for something that
happened in the heat of the
moment. If it’s anyone’s fault, it’s
mine.You_ gotta give East Carolina

Soccer blanked by Syracuse, stays winless in Big East

By Brian Gallagher
Sta_[)“W1'iler

Midfielder Paul Young scored
a goal and an assist to lead
Syracuse to a 3-0 Big East
Conference rout over the Pitt
soccer team last Saturday. The
loss dropped the Panther’s record
below the .500 mark for the first
time this season to 5-6-4. Pitt also
remains winless in league play

(0-S-2).

Barring a major upset. of
nationally ranked Seton Hall, Pitt
will finish last in the Big East.
Should that occur, it would mirror
the preseason coaches’ poll that
projected the Panthers would be
the worst team in the conference.

The Orangemen (9-7, 3-4 in
the Big East) outshot Pitt by a
whopping 17-3 count and allowed
only one Panther corner kick.‘

That total is comparable to a
football offense getting past
midfield only one time in a game.

The only saving grace for Pitt
was the play of senior netminder
Tim Sobelman, who made six
saves and kept the score
respectable in the first half.

“Tim played excellent,” said
assistant coach Heinz Pak. “It
could’ve easily been 4-0 in the
first half, if not for Tim.”

Trailing 1-0 at the half on an
unassisted goal by ‘Cuse
midfielder Tim Lester, Pitt.opened
the second half with its bestsoccer
of the day.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
it was a short-lived effort. “We
played well for the ﬁrst 10 minutes
[of the halﬂ,” Pak said, “then we
got tired.”

The Orange capitalized on the
Panther letdown by scoring two

Swirn

decisive goals in an 11-minute
span. Young made it 2-0 at the
24:24 mark with a blast from the
top of the box. And with 13
minutes remaining, Eric Puls
rounded out the scoring by
converting a Young feed into a
shot past the lunging Sobelman.

All afternoon, Young fought

Scott McCurry,v who__ returned to

coming season for this small but

talented Pitt squad. On Friday, ‘

the Panthers welcome St.
Bonaventure for a dual meet. On
Saturday, Syracuse will infest
Trees Pool’s waters.

As to how the team will handle
these opponents and the rest of
the year, senior Christine
Gallagher looks to the team’s
ability and togetherness. -“This
team is a so much better team
that it has been in my four years
here because [in the past], there’s
been a lot of problems within the
team itself, and not enough unity,”
Gallagher said. “l’Ihis year] there’s
more [unity] here than I’ve ever
seen," Gallagher added.

The Pitt men opened their
season with a 194-41 pasting of
the Duquesne men’s team.
Beginning their second season
under the direction of head coach
Chuck Knowles, the Panthers
allowed only five top-three
finishes to the Dukes (two
seconds and three, thirds).

Sophomore Sean Braud and
seniors Phil Cruz and Mike Naylor
led a Panther sweep in diving,
with Braud taking first in both
events.

Fred Constantini took first place
in the 1,000-yard freestyle with a
time of 10:10.69.

He finished a full minute and
20 seconds ahead of Duquesne’s
top swimmer. Constantini also

placed second in both the 100-
yard butterfly and the 100—yard
backstroke.

Knowles was encouraged by
the victory. “We did much better
this year than we did last year at
this meet,” he said, “and I think it
was due in part to a little bit better
concentration.”

‘He admits that last -year was
difficult due to it being his first
year as coach. “[Early on], the
guys were very leery of my ability

. as a coach,” he said. “They didn’t

know me from Adam.”

It wasn’t until the Pitt
Invitational that the team and
coach came to common ground
 Or water.

With the 1991—’92 season
welcoming nationa-1 power Miami
to league play, Knowles

acknowledges the ability of the

Hurricanes. “They are awesome,”
he said, “and they have depth in
every area that we have depth.”

Even with these accolades,
Knowles still thinks Pitt. can take
their 10th straight Big East
Championship. “The guys have
to decide for themselves whether
they really want another Big East
Championship,” he said, “and
when they decide to do it, we’ve
got enough talent here to win it.”

Sixers and Celtics to ﬁght it out in Atlantic   Division 

By Rob Pugliese
Sta_[f Writer -

The structure of the N BA’s
Atlantic Division takes on a new
and improved look with the
addition of the Orlando Magic to
the fold. The top of the standings
will have a familiar look, with the
most bitter rivalry in the league
boiling over hotter than ever in
the northeast. Every club here
has improved itself in the off-
season, but barring injuries, this
will be a two—horse race.

Always one player away from
reaching the finals, the
Philadelphia 76ers enter 1991
with good reason for optimism
after suffering through a
nightmare on Broad Street last
season.

Starting point guard Johnny
Dawkins went down only four
games into the campaign with a
serious kneeinjury (torn anterior
cruciate ligament), and with him
went the Sixers’ title hopes.
Charles Barkley suffered knee
and ankle injuries which forced
him to miss 15 games, but
somehow this club pulled
together, riding the wings of
blossoming all-star Hersey
Hawkins (22.1 pts.) to win 44
games and advance to the Eastern
Conference Semifinals. The Sixers
lacked interior- defense and
defensive rebounding down the
stretch as well as punch off the
bench, so major personnel moves
have taken place in Philly.

Life here begins and ends with

Soccer

Continued from page 12
the starting lineup after being out
with an injury. Although Young
had a goal and an assist, Pak was
impressed by McCurry’s play.
“Scott played well on Young,” he
said. ~ A

As for the overall effort of the
team, Pak was less enthused. “It
was like we didn’t show up," he
said. Pak answered hesitantly to
the suggestion that Pitt was
outclassed by Syracuse.

“They’re a good team,” he said,
“but it wasn’t a good game at all.”

The Panthers are winless in
their past five games, extending a
string ofbad soccer that is quickly
overshadowing the team’s early
season success.

Pitt held a solid 4-1-1 record
after five games, outscoring its
opponents by a 13-4 margin.

In those games, the Panthers
were getting three . essential
elements to winning soccer:
excellent goaltending, reliable
team defense and an offense that
created scoring opportunities.

Those elements, save for the
goaltending, have all but

disappeared from the team’s play. ‘

The Panthers have a woeful 1-5-
3 record in the past nine games,
and (not including Slippery Rock)
they have been outscored 15-S.

One could look at the schedule
as a reason for the slide. Pitt will
conclude the season by playing
six of its final seven games on the
road.

In addition, the Panthers have
seen more competitive teams like
UConn and fewer weaker

' opponents like Slippery Rock and
Canisius.

Barkley (27.6 pts., 10.1 boards),

the most dominantiinside force in _

the game, an inside banger, long-
range bomber and crafty
ballhandler all rolled into one.
Free—agent center Charles
Shackleford was lured back from
Europe to strengthen the pivot
and help Barkley clean the glass.
With Barkley, Hawkins, Armon
Gilliam (16.6), swingman Ron
Anderson and a healthy Dawkins,

"Shackleford won’t need to score

much. Power forward Jayson
Williams is 10 pounds lighter,
quicker and stronger and could
supplant Gilliam in the starting
lineup, depending on his
improved defense. Then again,
most people play better defense
than Gilliam. ’ _

Rookie guard Tharon Mayes of
Florida State has shined
throughout the summer and

exhibition seasons, and his

explosiveness, combined with the
touch of free—agent Mitchell
Wiggins, give “the Hawk” solid
support.

A tight race with the Celts, but
Barkley and a healthy Dawkins
make the difference. Philly will
win from’ 53 to 55 games and
meet Chicago in the Eastern
Finals.

The oldest trio in the NBA is
back on the attack, and the

Boston Celtics’ hopes remain ,

pinned on the health of the Big
Three. The aging-but—solid
frontline and exciting guards give
Beantown a serious title
contender yet again.

The living legend, Larry Bird,
brings a bad back with no
guarantees but still possesses the
gritty determination and
intangibles that keep the men in
green a threat at “winning time.”

To say that Bird lost a lot off his
lethal outside touch is a huge
understatement, but you have to
love his work off the boards. His
rebounding seems to get better
with age(?), and he still makes his
teammates a notch better. Bad
back and all, Bird will rack up his
share of triple—doubles again.

Kevin McHale (18.4 pts.) played
through much of the ’90 campaign
with a bad ankle but remains a
master in the paint. The Celtics
are a dangerous squad when
McHale kicks it into high gear.

The question that pops up every
year at this time is, of course,
“Can Robert Parish continue to
play at an all-star level at his age?”
The answer is “Why not?"

Versatile young gunners Reggie
Lewis (18.7) and Kevin Gamble
(15.6) will take further control of
this club, for it will be theirs to
run shortly.

I’m not on the Dee Brown
bandwagon. He’s not the answer
at the point, and 6—foot, 6-inch
Brian Shaw is adequate at the
very best. Shaw’s raw athleticism
is impressive, but he just can’t
run the show. Boston tried
desperately to peddle him
anywhere, possibly to Sacramento
for Wayman Tisdale, but that fell
through.

Big problems will arise if Injury

rears its ugly head, because the
Celts have a weak bench. Joe
Kleine, Michael Smith, Eddie
Pinckney— come on. With Parish
at 38, Bird soon 35 and McHale
soon 34, Boston is nearing the
end of the line. Like Philly,
Boston’s hopes lie as much on
their health as on their talent.
They’ll win over 50 again and
advance to the Eastern Semis.

New boss Pat Riley and the-

New York Knicks took a big
step toward becoming legitimate
division contenders by acquiring
strongman Xavier McDaniel from
Phoenix, but chaos still reigns in
one of the league’s shakiest
backcourts. Riley built a west

coast dynasty in LA, with his

Lakers rolling to four titles and
seven finals appearances in nine
years. The Big Apple and its
fickle fans and media can’t
possibly expect instant success

« like Riley had in LA, butsomething

tells me they do.

Patrick Ewing is the man to
build around. The NBA’s premier
pivotman is apparently content
with his ﬁnancial status as one of
the four highest-paid players in
the game. When motivated, the
warrior is awesome on both
offense and defense, combining
brute strength with touch —
simply unstoppable. Many
question Ewing’s leadership
qualities, and of all the superstars
in the elite echelon, I.’d have to
agree that Ewing is the most
suspect leader. Unlike the others,
he often disappears when times

grow toughest, but much of the
Big Apple media needlessly
crucify him. Expect Patrick to
explode and make a serious MVP
run this time.

This backcourt lacks intensity_ ‘

and maturity. The moody one,
point guard Mark Jackson, has
trimmed himself down
considerably in hopes of
resurrecting the Knicks’ fast break,
butJackson’s past tells us that he
could go off whining at any
moment, disrupting any
semblance of chemistry that Riley
builds here.

Potential is often an overused -

term in sports, usually wasted on
those who will never approach it.

Gerald Wilkins is one of the first A

people that ﬁts this company. He
showed flashes two years ago
but looked too streaky last season.
Wilkins is not a frontline-shooting
guard. With Ewing, ‘X-Man and
power forward Charles Oakley,
New York boasts the most
intimidatingfront court anywhere.
If only Oakley had any offensive
post moves or agility, he'd be
dangerous. He’s simply the best
rebounding forward in the game
(12.1 boards), save Barkley, but
he often clutters the offense and
throws up a 15~foot brick at crucial
moments. Despite

late April.

The Miami Heat have drafted D

serious run at the playoffs this
season. The Heat have strength at
the two most important positions:
point guard and center.

Rony Seikaly is the franchise
player, complete with a nine—year
deal worth $31 million. Sherman
“The General” Douglas has been
grumbling about his contract, but
he’ll be revved up when tip-off
time is here.

Blending in raw talent like Glen
Rice, Willie Burton and rookie
Steve Smith gives this club a
devastating fast break. Rice settled
down at small forward last year
after an up-’n'—down rookie
chapter (17.4 pts.). He plays weak
defense, consistently gets
whipped on the boards and
doesn't scare anyone with his
passing. At 6-6, Burton is a solid
swingman with great leaping
ability, nice touch and causes big
matchup problems at shooting
guard. The Heat will blaze their
way to 38 wins and the first
playoff spot for an expansion
club.

Big trouble in the nation’s
capital, and not from Ollie North,

either. The Washington Bullets
finished 23rd in the league in
scoring -and will be without all-
star forward Bernard King for at
least the first month of the season
(probably longer, due to King’s
ailing knees): Coach Wes Unseld
and the Bullets will implement
an up-tempo, motion offense to
take advantage of their personnel.

The Bullets shipped defensive

ace Darrell Walker to Detroit for
second-round draft choices in ’92
and ’93, and they acquired the
electric Michael Adams from
Denver to run the new offense.
Who better? Adams pushes the
ball upcourt and gets off the treys

faster than anyone, and the Bullets ’

will surround him with finesse-
style athletes such as ﬁrst—rounder
LaBradford Smith. The ﬂuid
Harvey Grant will hold the front
court together until King returns.
The X factor could be the always
plump John Williams. He says
he’s in better shape this year.
What? We'll have to wait and see
on that. If King doesn't come
back in a hurry, this team will be
buried fast, but they’ll at least be
exciting. ‘

Derrick Coleman lived, up to
every preseason accolade en
route to garnering the NBA’s
Rookie of lhe Year award last
season. With the selection of
Georgia Tech wizard Kenny
Anderson, the No.2 pick overall,
the New Jersey Nets
immediately look _much
improved. However the Bronx
bomber has yet to sign, and
negotiations have been dragging.
The late word is that Anderson
likes the $14 million over five
years offer, but GM Willis Reed
isn’t dancing on the Meadowla nds
floor yet.

There are definite sparks here.

\Once Anderson comes in, the
much—maligned Mookie Blaylock
will sit on the bench and actually
should beneﬁt from that. Forward
Chris Morris (13.2 pts}, 6.6 rebs.)
would be a more consistent player
if he eliminated bad shots.
Rebuilding from ground zero
takes a while, so don’t expect too
much from a few young guys yet.
Jersey needs a big man and a
couple more quality players.

Although Miami looks better
on paper this year, it was the

Orlando Magic that won more
games (31) than any of the other
expansion teams. They actually
had a better record than eight
other clubs last season. The
problem is the Magic have shifted
to a division with other improved

clubs. Orlando stockpiled more '

talent, but they won’t. be ready

for prime time yet.
First-rounder, 7-2 center Stanley

Roberts could start in the middle

right away and could dominate ’

in time. The Magic also picked up
Arizona's Brian Williams and
scrappy N.C. State general Chris
Corchiani, so good times are just
around the corner. Corchiani will
learn from the scrappiest of all_
‘guards, Scott. Skiles was a
magician, leading this club with
17.2 points and 8.4 assists per
game while winning the league’s
Most Improved Player Award. He
does it all: pushes the break,
jumpers from downtown, drives
and plays mean D. Off guard

4 Nick Anderson overwhelms most

of his opponents with a post-up
game reserved for most power
forwards. Not enough size, just
too many weaknesses up front. '

Rule

Continued from page 11

Woodstra also realizes that the
rally-point rule favors Pittbecause
of its strengths in certain areas of
the game. “Ourblock is not our
greatest asset,” Woodstra said.
“So we serve tough and force
opponents out of their primary
offensive attack.”

Forcing opponents out of their
game plan will allow a team to
run off three or four key points."
In the rally-point game, those

few points make a difference"

between winning and losing.

Pitt assistant coach Cindy
Braziel loves the rally-point game.
“It is thrilling, really nip—and—tuck,”
Braziel said. “It is the great
equalizer, ‘deciding between
teams that are really equal.”

Yet there are others who enjoy
this rule for different reasons.
Duquesne head coach Jeff Yurko
likes the intensity and pressure
that the rally-point game brings
to volleyball. “It is similar to the

two—minute drill in football,"
Yurko said. “The pressure is there,
but it makes you do the things
you have been taught to do.”
Rutgers head coach Teri Velardi
likes the rally-point rule but wants
it either to be a ful1—ﬂedged rule
or no rule at all. “We want to go
with it but not as an experimental

rule,” Velardi said. “Either make .

it a rule or don’t.”

The rally-point procedure has
gone over well with the coaches
and even better with the referees.
Referee Mark Haislup likes the
fact that rally-points speed up the
game and also bring out the best
in the players. “The players prove
themselves by carrying the
momentum,” Haislup said.

Coaching and refereeing the
rally-point game is one thing,
playing in it is another. It is the
players that must handle the
pressure. They must come
through when it is all on the line.
Some like it, andsome don’t.

Pitt senior Linda Zols doesn’t

— want the rally-point rule to be a

part of the pressurized ﬁfth game.

' “It affectsyour serving; you can’t

make that service error,” Zols
said. “The match comes down to
the wire, and you don’t have time
to think.”

“I don’t think it’s really fair,"
said Duquesne middle hitter
Lauren Nilsen. “The teams are
even, so we should play it like a
regular game.” Nilsen said she
hopes the regular format will
return and provide an equal
chance for each team to win.

But there are other players that
think the rule will stand and
enjoy playing by it. It seems that
many enjoy the pressure and the

challenge of making the fewest
mistakes.

Panther senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville thinks the rally-point
rule is good. “It _does put more
pressure on you, but I like the
pressure,” Zonneville said. “I like
the fact that it speeds up a match
that could be a very long one
otherwise.”

Others still like the challenge
of making the fewest mistakes.
“It puts plenty of pressure ,on
you, but I like that challenge,”
said Duquesne setter Julie
Fernacz. “That’s what volleyball"
is all about: accepting the
challenge to play harder,
accepting the challenge of the
rally-point game.”
