PHOTO COURTESY or SEMESTER AT SEA

The S.S. Universe Explorer has been re-routed around Luxor, Egypt in response to a terrorist attack there last fall. p

Semester at Sea,Stucly_Abroacl taking

Erin Lindeman

Staff _Writer V

With the bombings in Africa and

the tense situations in the Middle
East, Pitt’s Semester At Sea and
Study Abroad programs say they’re
taking precautions to keep students
safe. .

SAS spokesman Paul Watson
said the current voyage was re-rout-
ed around Egypt because of a terror-

ist attack at .a tourist attraction in

Luxor, Egypt last fall.

The simultaneous bombings of _

the United States embassies in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi,
Kenya, in ‘mid-August have been
linked to Osama bin Laden — a mul-
timillionaire who has declared a ter-
rorist war on the United States.

As a result, Watson said SAS
continues to monitor potentially
dangerous countries around the
world. .

It uses State Department advi-
sories, the Pinkerton Risk
Assessment program and contacts in
countries throughout the world, to

keep updated on safety information. 
A SAS is an international program.-':

that is based at and academically
sponsored by Pitt. The program
allows-students to live on a “ﬂoating
university,” with faculty consisting
of professors from all over the
world. Two or three faculty members
are usually Pitt professors. '
Watson said the spring voyage
— slated to leave in February 1999
—— is planning to stop at nine differ-

ent countries, including Venezuela, '

Brazil, South Africa and Kenya.
Although the Kenyan embassy
was bombed recently, Watson said

he’s not concerned about the stabili- '

ty of the country.

' But he added, “Whenever some-
one travels somewhere, he or she
needs to be aware of his or her sur-
roundings and issues. And in a for-
eign country, the environment is
quite different, so one needs to be
especially carefult”

He also said he feels the program ~

is capable of handling dangerous sit-
uations.

“We are always prepared to
reroute the course,” Watson said.
“We are constantly monitoring activ-
ity— in other countries and making
sure their environment is safe for us

precautions alter terrorist bombings

to travel [into].”

There are many ways in which
SAS prevents hazardous situations,
including making students aware of
possible difficulties with customs,
avoiding political demonstrations
and groups when visiting a country,
and teaching students to blend in
with the environment and culture of T
the country, Watson said.

Study Abroad Director Annagene ~

Yucas said the Study Abroad pro-

gram does not restrict students from»

visiting certain parts of the world.
“We do not ﬂatly say ‘no’ to a

particular place,” Yucas said. “The '

restrictions are ‘on a case-by-case
basis.” » -

However, due to the wars in
Eastern Europe, the Pitt in Serbia
program for last summer was can-
celed, she said.

_“If for any reason we feel a stu-
dent will not be safe in a particular
area, we will restrict it,” Yucas said.

p During orientation for the Study
Abroad ' program, students must
"attend discussion groups that
address health and safety awareness.
Yucas said the Study Abroad Office

Assault victim strikes   back
Ih rough defense education

Jessica Mialki
For The Pitt News

When Terri Ross was attacked
at home in the middle of the after-
noon with her three children in the
house, she didn’t have time to reach
for a phone or pepper spray.

“I felt blessed to come out
:unharmed. That is when I began
this journey,” said Ross, who now
holds a second—degree black belt in
tae kwon do and is dedicated to
teaching women to defend them-
selves.

Ross weighs no more than 120
pounds and stands 5—feet-6—inches
tall. Her physical appearance
reveals no sign of her martial_arts
capabilities. Her calm persona can
turn into a strong-disciplined
defense at the_ onset of an attack.

She went into Young Brothers
Tae Kwon Do, a martial arts studio
in Cranberry, to sign her children
up for self-defense lessons, and
before she left, her entire family
was registered.

Ross, who holds a bachelor’s
degree in safety studies and educa-
tion from West Virginia University,

‘ began studying and analyzing dif-

ferent sel'f—defense programs in
Pittsburgh. She said she came
across a false sense of security in

the women she -saw.

Ross said the programs she
studied taught “magic tricks,’.’ —
one or two fast moves that are
designed to stun or injure an attack-
er for a couple seconds. ‘

Ross said that these one-step
reactions only turn on the victim.
“Your [attacker’s] 200 pounds of
anger just turned into 250 pounds of
fury,” she said.

“My personal experience and
degree in education and safety
makes me an authority on self-
defense,” said Ross, who designed
and teaches her own self-defense
training program at Young
Brothers.

She said her program teaches
combat skills rather than memo-
rized, routine steps, a difference
which she said makes her method
superior:

Ross is holding a three-hour
seminar Sunday, Oct. 11. at the
William Pitt Union. Student gov-
ernment, Sexual Assault Services
and the Pitt Police funded the semi-
nar.

Grand Master Kong, an eighth-
degree black belt and world karate
champion, praised Ross’ program.

“Mrs. Ross put together a pro-'
gram different from others,” he

Racist e-m

Karen Eschbacher
The Daily Free Press

BOSTON (U-WIRE) Boston
College students outraged by a
racist e-mail sent to minority lead-
ers are banding together to show
they won’t tolerate hate and igno-
rance on campus. .

‘Thirteen members of BC’s Asian.
American, Hispanic, African
American and Native American stu-
dents organization received an
anonymous e-mail early Thursday
morning urging them to leave the
school.

The e-mail read: “Hey monkees
and apes. You all need to go back to
where you.came from. BC is for
white men, not any chinks, spicks,
niggers or fags.”

Students angered by the e-mail
planned to wear blue Monday as a
show of solidarity, said Kohtaro
Takeuchi, a spokesman for the
school’s Asian Caucus and a BC
junior. On Thursday and Friday, stu-
dents observed 15 minutes of
silence at 12:45 p.m. to protest the
e-mail. Takeuchi said he expects the
practice ‘to continue through the
week. i

”Peop|e  can't believe this happened”

“A lot ofpeople are saying they
can’t ‘believe ‘this happened,’_’ he
said. “The students who received

the e-mail areextremely disturbed
to say the least. It, was personally
insulting, and it jeopardized their

safety.” .
Nearly 1,000 students gathered
Thursdaynight at a forum moderat-

ed by the student body president and -

attended by BC President William
Leahy. One student read a list of
demands that included banning anti-
gay discrimination at BC.

“The .administration has taken,
in my opinion, the correct steps up
to this point,” said George Atallah, a
BC junior and spokesman for the
school’s undergraduate student gov-
ernment. “If the administration fails
to follow up on at least some of the

students’ concerns, then they have

failed.”
Five recipients of the e-mail

spoke at the meeting, and university ‘

officials said they called‘ in the FBI
and plan to file criminal charges.
While the meeting gave students
a chance to vent their frustration,
Ata_1lah questioned its effectiveness.
“People who really needed to
hear those things might not have
been there,” he said. “I think that’s
the saddest part, that ‘people feel

"they don’t have to deal with it, so

they don’t.”

exists on campus, Takeuchi said.
The e-mail just brought the problem
to light, he said. _ '
“This is nothing new at BC,”
Takeuchi said. “I do believe there is
a certain sentiment of ignorance that
is neglected. A lot of what they say
is, ‘We’re taking appropriate mea-
sures,’ but that’s obviously not
enough, because these things still
exist.” '

Campus police are investigating ,

the incident. The targets may have
been chosen from a four-page sec-
tion highlighting minority student
leaders last Monday in BC’s student
newspaper, The Heights.

is putting more time and energy into
the safety discussions, partly
because of the tension in some for-
eign countries.

“With the excitement [of travel-
ing abroad], sometimes the reality of
an on-site situation can be over-
looked by the students,” Yucas said.
“Through orientations and discus-
sions, we hope students are well pre-
pared in the event that a situation
does occur.” , _

Although the SAS office is try-
ing hard to do its job of keeping stu-
dents avvare of worldwide issues,
according to Yucas, students are also
expected to stay informed about sit-
uations that "might affect their safety.

Pointing out that potentially
dangerous situations can arise in any
country at any time, she said, “It is
extremely unsafe to drive a car on an
American street.”

Although the Study Abroad
Office is taking precautions, Yucas
explained that staff members don’t
want to overreact.

“We don’t want to be over—cau-
tious and preventative,” she said.
“After all, we have to keep perspec-

Such is life for a small ﬁsh looking to '

make a huge splash in the big pond

In Harrisburg, Lloyd is known as a con-
sensus builder, the man behind the scenes
working to ensure that legislation passes
with the right amount of ‘bipartisan support
However, with the position comes little
media attention and even fewer headlines,
leaving many voters throughout
Pennsylvania with no knowledge of the
nine—terrn state representative from
Somerset

“Because I’m not extremely well-
known, I have adopted the strategy of carn-
paigning. at the ‘grass-
roots, gomg to prcmcs,
fairs, townhall meet-
ings,” Lloyd said. “I
think in a grass—roots
campaign you can’t
leave any stone
untum ”

Logging over
11,000 miles across the
state, sometimes travel-
ing up to 500 miles in
one day, Lloyd is conﬁ-
dant that if he could talk
to every voter in
Pemisylvania he would
easily overcome Specter
to take the U.S. Senate
seat But with little cam-
paign money and no
sign of raising big bucks _ ' "
in the coming weeks, Lloyd is reduced to
hurtling from one end of the state to the
other in his 1996 Dodge Stratus instead of
running radio and television campaign ads
aimed at reaching a larger segment of the
population. , -

It also doesn’t help that he is running
against one of Pennsylvania’s best-known
politicians.

“Lloyd’s got two diﬁerent issues to deal
with — facing an incumbent and facing an
incmnbent like Arlen-Specter,” said Bert
Rockrnan, a professor in Pitt’s political sci-
ence department.

Not only is Specter a “terriﬁc money
raiser,” he also is a good politician,
Rockrnan said.

Specterhas anestimated$6rnillionin
the bank, money he is ready to use at the
drop of a hat in the event of a political
onslaught, provided the Lloyd contingent
can muster some type of offense.

Right now, however, Lloyd is “living
hand ‘to mouth,” scrambling for money
from fellow Democrats and other interested
parties and only ﬁnding peanuts. He attrib-
utes this lack of giving to the Democratic
loosing streak in Pennsylvania and to the
fact that he is challenging a longtime incum-

“lVlr. Lloyd is a stupendously qualiﬁed
candidate and it is an utter shame that big
money, TV money - Specter, big, TV
money - will dominate the process, prevent-
ing Lloyd from quite possibly moving to the
forefront,” said state House Minority
Leader Bill DeWeese.

ItalsohurtsthatSpecterhasusedhis
time in ofﬁce to cultivate support from
many traditionally Democratic constituen-
cies in the state, Rockrnan said, the most
recent being labor union support.

“Lloyd is facing an incumbent who is
really taking the middle out of ﬂre race,”
said Rockman.

For Lloyd, who considers himself to be
a moderate Democrat, this spells doom.

But the man with the thinning gray hair
and the slightly stooped shoulders trudges
on, stumping on issues like Social Security
and health care — things about which the
American people truly care, he says.

His campaign consists of three major
Democratic ideals: saving Social Security,
passing a health care
consruners’ bill ‘of
rights and making
health insurance
more alfordable for
everyone.

He blasted
Republican plans to
use the federal bud-
get surplus for tax
cuts instead of saving
Social Security,
_ advocating that the

surplus be used to
pay forfuture bene-
ﬁts. Lloyd cautioned
that putting off
investment in the
Social Security trust
fund will require
 "  either a tax increase
or a cut in other federal programs in tl1e_
future.

“There is a lot of skepticism out there
that students of college age will have Social
Security,” he said “I think it should be
there.”

Criticizing insurance companies for
placing too much emphasis on cutting costs
instead of providing quality care, Lloyd
feels an appeals process included within a
consumer bill of rights would give people
an effective way to challenge decisions
about their health care. He also believes
every plan should pay for out-of—area cover-
age, especially important for students
whose parents may live out of state or at the
opposite end of Pennsylvania.

In addition, Lloyd feels people should
be allowed to subtract part of the cost of
their health insurance premium ﬁom their
income taxes. The tab would be-picked up
by the tobacco industry, he said, as reim-
bmsement for the higher costs tobacco use
imposes on health insurance premiums.

“People in their early twenties are the
lowest percentage of health insurance hold-
ers because they can’t afford it and they feel
they can go without it because they are
healthy,” Lloyd said.

Semester at Sect students
should get to see Cuba

Due to recent international inci-
dents — particularly the embassy.
bombings in Tanzania and Kenya
and the U.S. bombing of suspected
terrorist sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan — Pitt’s Semester at Sea pro-
gram has changed its route and
taken necessary precautions to keep
students on board the S.S. Universe
Explorer safe.

One proposed route change is a
four—day stop in Cuba. Of course,
some people in the State
Department will not be too happy
with this, due to heavy sanctions
placed on Cuba by the United States
(including the notorious
Buckley/Helrns agreement, which
prohibits the trade of just about
everything, including the kitchen
sink), which date back to the early
‘60s. Our point is one that’s been
hammered time and again: The
sanctions do more harm to the
Cuban people than they do to Fidel
Castro’s government. , ’ _

SAS is reportedly seeking a
licence for the ' S.S. Universe
Explorer to dock for four days in
Havana and to allow 600 students
and faculty members to disembark.

There is absolutely no reason
why students on the . SAS program
should not visit Cuba.

_ The anti-Cuba legislation is out-
dated and suited only to formerly

rich Cubans who lost their casinos
and hotels, and foreign corporations
that had their property nationalized.
Even for those who dogrnatically
stick to it, what disadvantages to the
United States could students visiting
Cuba bring?

‘ Americans have been bombard-
ed with. plenty of misconceptions
about Cuba, but students should be
allowed to see the country for them-
selves; they should see what com-
munism is like ﬁrst hand.

Cuba is, after all, a Caribbean
island, with all the natural attractions
that make places like the Bahamas,
Bermuda, Florida and the Cayman
Islands worth visiting. Cuba has a
rich cultural heritage, and it would
be a shame for American students to
miss out on it because of an outdat-
ed American embargo.

Instead of condemning Cuba by
enforcing ridiculous embargoes, the
U.S. government should allow its
citizens exposure to it. Pittsburgh

already has a Cuban sister city in

Matanzas: It’s clear the attitudes of
American politicians are changing.

Though nothing is concrete,
SAS’ idea is great, and the opportu-
nity should not be missed.

From there, we look forward to
the day when we can go to a travel
agency and book a week’s spring
break vacation in Havana. I

A WESEASON. BUT AT Lrrsr we DON'T
HAVE To PUTUP WITH IZODMAN
, For: THAT MUCH Lorlbr-:2!

  

 

  Fifteen credits is never too few

I remember my freshman class sched-
ule, but I would much rather forget it. You
see, like many other students (freshmen
especially), I was misguided into believing
that I had to rush, rush, rush in order to keep
up with my “credit quota.” During my
freshman year, I ended up taking 35 credits
 it was HELL!

It was a terrible experience that I vowed

never to endure again, but not for the rea-

sons one might suspect. It wasn’t the 35
credits "themselves, nor was it the tremen-
dous amount of work that accompanied
them. The - horror and pain I experienced
was a result of the classes I chose.

I jumped into my freshman year with
both feet. I had a rough idea of my major,
and nearlyall the classes I took were based
on that major. Not only was I bored out of
my mind, but I also failed at get-
ting what this University prides
itself on giving to students: a well-
rounded education. My class 7
schedule was so concentrated on

political science and philosophy, I feltlike

Thomas Jefferson and Socrates were telling
me what to do.

’ Sufﬁce to say, I did not enjoy my edu-
cation during my first year. Though every-
thing else was going ﬁne —-— socially and
with my extracurricular activities —-— it was
hard to keep my depression over my classes
from interfering with my life. I knew that an
overhaul was deﬁnitely in order.

The following year, I knew the time for
change was at hand. I decided to lighten my

workload, so instead of taking somewhere‘

near 20 credits, I opted for a very modest
12. This way I- avoided burning out like I did
during my first year, and I could nurse the
sorry QPA that resulted from it. Remember,
take your time with your education. Don’t-
pile class upon class if you can’t handle it,
or you’ll ﬁnd yourself on an express trip
back home via the expulsion you’ll get here.

I knew just lightening my load was not
going to be enough, so I went further and
made sure I didn’t have any sunrise classes.
I think that’s not too hard for most students
to understand: When given the option of a
class at 8 a.m. and a few extra hours of shut-
eye, I’m guessing most students will take

the pillow over the professor. Sleep is very
important to the learning process — know

‘when and where to do it: at night in a bed,

not during the day in class.

Finally, I ﬁgured that having only four
classes wasn’t bad and having none of them
at the crack of dawn was a good thing. But
if they were all from the same department or
all requirements I didn’t really want to take,
I would be in the same hell as I was during
my freshman year. So_I decided to take only
one class in my major, one class for a
requirement, one class to satisfy an interest
of mine, and ﬁnally, one class for fun. Oh
yeah, that’s right. No typo here — FUN.

There are so many fun classes you can.

take to relieve stress and break up your
monotonous existence. For example, noth-

ing gets the blood pumpinglike a good‘

physical education class such as
soccer, aerobic boxing, judo and so
on. The one I decided on was in
the theater department. The class
was Introduction to Performance.

It is just a fun class where a person can
let loose any built—up frustrations on the
stage. It’s a class where, through different
exercises, a person becomes more con1fort—
able on stage and with communicating in
general. I would recommend this class to
anyone who has an overworked schedule, a
fear of performing or an interest in the stage.
It’s what I like to call a “one—size—ﬁts-all
class.”

That’s about all the advice I have to
give about overworked class-schedule
relief. My three main points are pretty sim-
ple: '

0 Don’t try and take to take more cred-
its than you are capable of passing.

- Don’t take any classes in which you
can’t stay awake.

0' Take a break and throw in a fun class.

Doing these three things will make
nearly any student healthy, wealthy and
wise. But only if you want it and you’re
willing to work for it. In life, there are no
easy answers, quick ﬁxes or sure things.
Life is what we make of it. »

Tony Qliva suggests making life ﬁm, chal-
lenging and exciting. You will not be sorry.

The effects of tetrah drocannabinol on
underg1;at_iuate laboratory technicians

 Using small amounts of marijuana
(also known as dope, weed, wacky—weed,
wild-and-wacky-weed, wet—wild—and-
wacky-weed, or grass), which contains the
chemical THC, we wanted to determine
what eﬁect the street-purchased narcotic
would have on a young adult.

Pre-lab: We obtained our samples of THC
from our lab instructor, who said it was
“ﬁrst rate weed stulf.” We believed him. He
also told us the cost of the dope would be
covered by our lab fee. However, he men-
tioned the need to buy rolling paper, which

' is available at the campus bookstore.

Fortunately for us, one of our group mem-
bers was a self-proclaimed “pot—head” (an
observation later conﬁrmed during the lab),
so he was able to provide us with grade-A

rolling paper. A
Procedure: We ﬁrst took the dope and

placed it on the counter. Then, using the
rolling paper and our lab partner’s “six
years. of experience,” we carefully rolled
several “damn ﬁne—looking joints.” Mike
went ﬁrst, lighting up using the available
Bunsen burne'r. He took a long drag and

- slowly said, “Ah, yeah.” We waited for a

Jim, after several minutes, turned to me
and asked about the others in the room.
When I tried to ﬁnd out why, he simply
held up a ﬁnger and said, “Just a minute —
the others are talking about the others.” He

When “Jim” was aboutto light up, we
noticed Mike about to pound a shot of
methanol. Again, we had to take this away
from him. Mike then became engrossed
with the lab manual. We didn’t let him
know he had it upside down.

Finally, Jim was able to light up, this
time with a lighter (we had learned our les-
son about the Bunsen burner). As the drugs

uptight as usual and seemed to be getting
along very nicely. Even the TA took part, to
further assure himself of his previous

After some more time, everyone sat.

became fascinated by a colony of dust bun-
nies reproducing under the lab bench. One

was able to hear the “cheers from Three
Rivers.” Half a dozen began to have a large
staring contest, although later I found out it
was no contest after all.

Results: Quite amusing, really. We were
able to collect a large amount of qualitative
data from this experiment.

Comments: The results of this experiment

could have been tainted. Several lab mem-
bers were experienced “pot heads,” while
others.were ﬁrst-time users. Also, after a
quick survey, I soon discovered that many
had done other drugs. Actually, one person
said that he had smoked some “wicked
crack” right before lab. He said it gets him
going better than “being smacked in the
face with a sack of nails.”

Conclusion: Through the use of street-
bought marijuana, (Mary Jane, cannabis,
pot) we were able to discover (some redis-
covered) the effects on young students in a
lab enviromnent ‘

It’s a quite unique feeling you get when
a court summons comes in the mail.

It’s not an Ed McMahon/Dick Clark
“I—will-ignore-this—sweepstakes-form-
because-I—will-never-win emotion,” or one
of impending doom, mutilation or dismem-

berment. Rather, you respond in a way sim-

ilar to the narrator in John Updike’s story
“A&P,” in which the main character
remarks, “I knew how awful the world was
going to be from now on.” .

That and you curse a blue streak for
about ﬁve minutes. Congratulations.
You’ve been sued.

Since certain actions are still pending, I
will not drag my (in my opinion) horse’s
patoot of a landlord through the mud by
mentioning his name or even my old
address. Let’s just say that my landlord was

asking for a princely sum in rent, which he '

claimed was not paid, for our eviction from
our apartment and -— adding insult upon
injury — for court costs.

Being a typical college student, I was
mystiﬁed. What? Who? Me sued? By that
dirty $&#*? What do I do now?

Unless you are independently wealthy
or have your parents come up with money
for a lawyer, you will have to defend it on
your own. Even the local_ Neighborhood
Legal Services won’t defend /you until after
you lose. Murphy’s Law, I guess.

As for defending yourself, I recom-
mend it. Even if this is the ﬁrst time you’ve

been sued, it will probably not be your last.
You’ll have to become mature enough to
deal with these real life issues eventually, so
best to do it while you still have a sem-
blance of a safety net.

Tips for winning (and staying sane):

1. Save everygng. In my action, my
brother and I were able to disprove most of
the monetary claim against usbecause we
presented cancelled checks cashed by the
building’s then-owner for the rent that was
“missing.” The several threatening letters
we also got ﬁom our “new” landlord were
also very enlightening. .

2. Ask for it in writing. If your landlord
sends you a handwritten note saying that
you can have a French poodle, save it. If
you ask for a rent reduction while you’re
away for the summer, and the landlord
agrees, have him sign an agreement If you
get hauled into court because of Flulfy or a
“missing” rent payment, the judge probably
won’t accept a “we shook on it” spiel. As
movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn once said,
“A verbal contract isn’t worth the paper it’s
printed on.”

3. Don’t trash the place. While I was
preparing our case, I took an informal poll
of several friends about what they would do

_ in my shoes. The general consensus was,

“Destroy the $&*@ing apartment.”

If you have been slighted and destroy
everything in the apartment to exact some
sort of vengeance, it doesn’t matter how
“wrong” the landlord was. All he would
have to do to destroy your credibility is pre-
sent a few pictures to the magistrate detail-

surviving a lawsuit

ing the H-Bomb you set olf in your apart-
ment in living, glowing color. Kiss your
security deposit (and possibly your ﬁee—
dom) goodbye.

Your defense is that you have done
nothing wrong. Stick to it.

4. Plan your defense. If you have any-

intention of winning, you cannot assemble
your case the night before, stumble into the
courtroom with a few notes jotted down
and say “Your Honor, that man is an ass 
I rest my case”. ' .

As a student, you should be used to
writing papers, notes, themes, etc. Write an
outline, a chronology of events and relevant
points. .Write it out as if you were present-
ing it in front of a public speaking class, and
if you get ﬂustered, just keep your eyes
glued to the paper and read it. Out loud,
preferably.

5. Forget evemtjng you’ve seen on
“Ally McBeal”. Forget saying such ringing
phrases like “If the glove don’t ﬁt, you must
acquit.” That only works in Los Angeles for
rich, washed-up football players being tried
for murder in ﬁont of an inept judge, an
imbecilic prosecution and an ignorant jury.

But I digress. Your defense is that you
are an innocent student being besieged by
an evil, tyrannical robber baron. If you start
dragging Latin phrases into the proceed-
ings, saying things like non sequiter, ipso

facto, quo vadis, or in utero, the judge will
lose all patience and bounce you out of the
courtroom + deservedly so.

It’s not brain surgery. It’s the law.

6. Realize and understand the stereo-

gym. You, Joe and Jane Average, are col-
lege students, and at ﬁrst glance you are

, guilty. It’s not nice to say it, but students are

one rtmg above cockroaches and the crimi-
nally insane in the great “Who’s Guilty?”

. guessing game. We are alleged partyers,

drinkers, smokers, copulation artists and

” spend—happy little monsters who are wild

and rebellious, feeding off the money teat
that is Mom and Dad.

And guess what: T‘l1at’s the impression
that landlords count on. So for the love of
God, shave off your beard (men only),
wash the dye out of your hair, take oﬂ the
Grateful Dead T-shirt and put on a sweater.
You have the rest of your time here to look
like a cretin.

7. Relax. You are not‘ being tried for
treason or ﬁrst-degree murder. This is a rel-
atively simple matter. At the best outcome,
you’ll be acquitted. At the worst, your land-
lord will have possession, but you can still
appeal before an eviction can happen. Just
because you lose doesn’t mean you will.
immediately be cast to the dogs.

Keep this all in mind, have faith in your
ability to drag yourself out of the crosshairs,
and who knows what will happen? If you
win, you might ﬁnd respect for the law and
for its adjudicators, and change their minds
about college students.

‘If not, you can always blame the sys-
tem.

This vehicular madness must stop

Adam Schaible

In case you haven’t noticed
yet, it’s getting harder to get
around in Pittsburgh these days.

A USA Today survey pub-
lished Sept. 28 showed that
more Americans than ever
before, over 85 percent, use a
car to go about their daily busi-
ness. By comparison, 5 percent
walk, and only 2 percent use
public transportation. And the
gap is widening.

America’s love alfair with
the automobile is, of course,
responsible for the chaos. And
it’s going to get worse. There are
more two— and three-car house-
holds than ever before, the result
of families with more than one
commuter every day. It’s my
guess that 40 years ago, when
the city of Pittsburgh had double
its current population, traffic
was not bad at all, given the

number of families with only

one car or none at all. _
.A description of traffic

woes in Pittsburgh quickly turns .

into an exhaustive narrative that-
is much too large for even this
column. But there are certain
areas to be avoided almost uni-
laterally during the daylight

hours — the Liberty, Squirrel ‘

Hill and Fort Pitt tunnels.
People lose their nerve going
through these tunnels — I can
recall someone going 25 mph
through the Squirrel Hill
Turmels and not beingable to do
a thing about it, as passing is
prohibited. Though I’m not a
psychologist, it’s my guess that
the overhead lights and turmel
walls whizzing past lead
motorists to assume their speed

is much greater than it actually

. exhibition

 

is. Let’s hurry it up, folks. You
won’t be the next Princess
Dianaifyouspeedupto55
mph.

The most recent traffic
debacle in the area was the delay
caused by three construction
workers on I-79 in Washington
County, which delayed
motorists headed to a Steelers

game in
Morgantown for several hours.
The trafﬁc was so bad that not
even the players themselves
arrived in time for kickoff.
Though PennDOT explains that
the workers‘ were in the wrong
place at the wrong time, it cer-
tainly hasn’t done much to
improve the image of the
agency.

It certainly has become de
rigeur to pick on PennDOT
these days, so I’ll back oﬁ’ for
now. They’re not the only thing
wrong with the state of motor-
ing these days. Take, for exam-
ple, the legions of pinheaded
suburbanites in their sport utility
vehicles, their arrogant, gas-
guzzling ranks swelling by over
half a million each year. What’s
up with these folks? Part of me
attributes their newfound domi-
nance to a sort of lingering
admiration for our Desert Storm
heroes in their Humvees, which,
incidentally, are now made in a
civilian version to capitalize on
the craze.

But I drink these vehicles
are truly popular for another,
somewhat more disturbing rea-
son. With all the incidents of so-
called “road rage” these days,
people want to be seen behind
the wheel of a large, aggressive-
looking vehicle for its intimida-
tion factor. That goof in the
Toyota who cut you off? Let’s

scare the dickens out of him!
T'hat’ll show him! i

Sometimes it worries me,
however, that my opinions are
shaped too much by certain
folks’ total ignorance. During
the Blizzard of 1996, I was able
to observe any number of intre-
pid souls going about their busi-
ness using four-wheel-drive
vehicles. One motorist skidded
into a 10-foot snowbank and
called for a tow. Upon reaching
the vehicle, the tow-truck driver
observed that the motorist did
not even have four-wheel-drive
selected. What would you do in
that situation? Personally, I’d
keep my mouth shut and take
the idiot’s money, and I think a
good percentage of you" would
do the same.

But in Pittsburgh, it’s not
just when you’re on the road
that you’re in peril, but when
you pull over to park as well.
I’ve gotten three tickets in the
past month, two of them for
street-cleaning (which never
took place, but that’s just sour

, grapes on my part) and one for

parking in a permit zone with-
out, well, a permit. But you are
allowed one hour, and when I
found a ticket on my car after a
half-hour stay in Zone D, I
decided enough was enough. 2
Traffic court is a terriﬁc
source of entertainment, espe-
cially if you get a good judge.
You learn a lot about how
ungrateful people can be as
well. One person, after winning
his hearing and having a $200
ticket dismissed, was presump-

tuous enough to ask the judge to _

reﬁmd his $60 tow charge too!
Something about giving a man a
hand and he’ll take your whole
arm But this judge was

LETTERS

furmy. The defendant irnmedi—
ately before me that night was a
ﬂarmel-clad slacker. “Your
honor, Ijust got a new car, and
I’m still waiting for my permit.
So a put a sign on my wind-
shield asking them not to tick-”

The judge interrupted him.
“Oh, new car? What kind?”

“A red Jeep Wrangler,”
replied the student. “Here’s a

picture,” said the young man as '

he handed the judge a photo he
had taken, as many defendants
are wont to do.

“Oh, that’s a nice car,
how’d you get it? You sell
drugs?” replied the judge in a
total deadpan.

As it turned out, the man’s
ticket wasn’t for a permit viola-
tion anyway, but for — you
guessed it —— street cleaning. So
he lost. But the judge lowered
his ﬁne.

I met with a bit more suc-
cess and had my ﬁne totally dis-
missed As I walked out of the
courtroom, I wore a smug little
expression all the way into the
parking lot, where realized that I
would still owe the city money
— this time, for parking in the
municipal lot. As I handed my
ticket and cash to the man in the
booth, I pondered the true cost
of victory.

Well, it was cheaper than a
cab. And it was enough to keep
me, in this city of concrete and

steel, rollirr’ along, at least until *

the next set of traﬂic cones.

Adam Schaible wants the young
lady who never called back after
his Volkswagen broke down on
the way to their ﬁrst date earlier
this year to know that she
missed out on what could have
been a beaulzﬁtl relationship.

Fans, get your ‘
butts in the
stands

Pitt Stadium seats 56,150 peo-

ple. The paid attendance for this
past weekend’s game against Akron
was 37,357. The number of people
who actually showed up was proba-

I bly half that. Where is everyone?

What happened to the sellout
crowd from the Penn State game?
What happened to the rowdy,
obnoxious Pitt fans who were wor-
thy. of a thank-you letter from Walt

Harris published in The Pitt News? .

From what I saw this past Saturday,
they never existed. A

‘ Just like the Miami game last
year, the Penn State game was com-
parable to a circus act. Everyone
had to see what the uproar was and
wanted_to be part of the big event.
When the fans were needed the most

last year, such as at the Syracuse‘

and Virginia Tech games, the num-
ber of fans considerably decreased.
Although the paid attendance is list-
ed at 46,102 and 34,144, respective-
ly, the actual attendance was consid-
erably less. _I don’t understand why.

Many people tell me that the

weather was too bad to go to the last

two games a year ago, and the same
excuse was given for the Akron

game. To quote Bill Cosby, it was i

“icky, yucky.” That’s football! Do
you see grown men running around
the football field in tutus and lace
slippers. No! ' ‘
They wear shoulder pads and
helmets so they won’t crack their
heads open. Do you see these men

apologizing for playing too roughly '

and avoiding puddles so they won’t
get wet and dirty? No! Theyplay at
the highest intensity, hoping to pun-
ish the other team for stepping on
the field, tackling opponents with
such. authority that’ grass" and ‘mud
become part of the enemies’ face
masks. 1

Football was meant to played
outdoors, where the elements play a
factor in the game. If anyone saw
the Seattle Seahawks vs. Kansas

City Chiefs game on Sunday night,_

then you witnessed some horrible
weather conditions, as nearly four
inches of rain fell in an hour.

at home, though. Instead,

There is something in the air. With

there is a quiet anticipation.

Hockey is coming.

teams are trimming their rosters for the
opening of the season. Here is the skin-

New Jersey Devils — Ever hear of '

Martin Brodeur? He holds virtually

Pitt lands top Jersey point guard

Pitt has reportedly
received a verbal commit-
ment from point guard
Brandin Knight for the
1999-2000 basketball sea-
son.
Knight, the brother of
Cleveland Cavaliers point
guard Brevan Knight,
hails from Seton Hall Prep
in New Jersey. Like his
older brother, Brandin is a
prototypical point guard:
He’s six feet tall, and he
averages a lot of assists, a
lot of steals and not many

. oints per game.

It should come as no
surprise that Brandin’s
biggest asset is his
defense, speciﬁcally his
ability to steal the ball
from opponents; the older
Knight almost led the
NBA in steals this past
year as a rookie.

Brandin Knight joins
6-foot-6-inch power for-
ward Jamal Brown as the
two recruits from whom
Pitt has reportedly
received verbal v commit-
ments. A verbal "commit-
ment is nonbinding: A
player carmot ofﬁcially
commit himself to a col-
lege before the November
signing ‘period of his
senior year in high school.

Brown is a senior at
national power Maine
Central Institute and gave
Pitt head coach Ralph
Wrﬂard his verbal com-
mitment in early- August.
Brown attended Dunbar
High School in Baltimore
last year, leading the team

to a national top-20 ﬁnish .

in. USA Today’s high
school rankings.
Two other top recruits

also might end up in
Panther uniforms next
season: DerMa1r Johnson
and Rodney White.
Johnson is a 6-9, do-it-all
player who plays at MCI
with Brown. He is a top-
ﬁve recruit who is so good
he considered leaving
high .school after his
junior year to enter the
NBA draft.

White is a 6-9 power
forward from Newport

High School in‘

Kensington, Md. He plays
a solid inside-outside

~ game, meaning he’s pow-

erful enough to bang on
the boards and swat shots,
but he’s also agile enough
to play away from the bas-
ket. Pitt is considered by
many basketball writers to
have the inside track to get
both Johnson and White.

where Richter was headed. After the
Rangers ﬁgured out that it might not
have been their goalie who was doing a
horrible job, but the tearn’s offense,
which only posted a 2.4 goals—per-
game average for the season. A player
who will not be returning to the
Rangers, or to the game of hockey, is
Pat LaFontaine. The veteran who
appeared in 67 games last season will
not return due to a head injury.
Predicted Division Finish: 4th

New York Islanders — Does the fun
ever start? If there was anything good
to say about the Islanders’ 1997-98 sea-
son, it is that they didn’t ﬁnish last.
Their 30-41-11 record kept them out of
hopelessness and in mediocrity. With
average penalty killing (10th in the
NHL) and power plays (10th), this
team has little chance of presenting
itself as a Cup contender. On average,
the Islanders scored less than their
opponents, and with their limping
offense, they were 7-26-3 when their
opponents scored first. Watch for
Kenny Johnsson to help carry his team
this season. As for how far it will go,
don’t hold your breath.

Two Pitt students competed in the ‘
National Collegiate Tae Kwon Do
Championships at Princeton University
Saturday, and both brought home medals.

Freshman Para Kikrilis won the gold
medal in her division. She has a red belt in
tae kwon do and is the reigning Junior
Olympic champion in her class.

Kelly Schreckengost, a third-year law
student, took the bronze medal in the
black-belt - division. Because
Schreckengost has a black belt, she was
able to qualify for a competition in
Cleveland that will determine who will
compete in the World Games in Mexico
later this year.

“It was exciting to see the girls do so
well,” said Anne Crory, the women’s assis-
tant coach and trainer for Pitt’s tae kwon
do club. “They represented Pitt with great
pride. We should all be very proud of them.

Crory said. “This will be the ﬁrst time tae

Offense is Walt Harris’ specialty, but
it’s defense where Pitt has ﬂourished all
season.

_ Unlike last season, when the offense
carried the team, the 1998 Panther
defense has stiﬂed opposing teams so
effectively, it is ranked 10th in the nation,
compared to the offense’s ranking of 71st.

“Well, we’re real proud of that,”
Harris said. “'I‘hat’s something [we] have
been working on for a long time because
we know you win championships on
defense.”

Senior linebacker Phil Clarke has
paced the defense, -I —
leading the team 
with 36 tackles. DJ. ‘
Dinkins is second
with 28.

Despite the
struggles with mov-
ing the ball as a
team, a few individ- 
ual Panthers show
up in the national
rankings on offense
as well.Sophomore .
wide receiver Latef 
Grim is ﬁfth in the
country in receiving ‘ V
yardage, averaging
122.25 A yards per
game. He has
grabbed 26 passes
for 489 yards,

 

kwon do gets this recognition, so everyone
is working hard to make the team.”

Crory, a Pitt graduate, had a second-
degree black belt, and she explained how
tae kwon do differs from other martial aits.

According to Crory, tae kwon do is
extremely technical, and it has a different
scoring style than karate, another martial
art Because of the scoring, tae kwon do
has become more organized, which is a
reason why it will be seen in the next
Olympics. The belts in tae kwon do, from
lowest rank to highest rank, are white, yel-
low, green, blue, blue with red stripe, red,
red with one stripe, red with two stripes

"and black. Kikrilis and Schreckengost are

high on the ranking scale.

Crory has a little taste of what it’s like
to be a winner as well. She held the title of
Pennsylvania state champion in 1996
along with the silver medal in the national
collegiate contest.’ Because of an injury,
Crory is unable to compete any longer.

‘However, she does instruct at Pitt on

including seven touchdowns.

The other Panther holding a notewor-
thy position in the national rankings is
quarterback Matt Lytle, who is ranked
18th in quarterback eﬁciency. -

The senior has completed 55 of 97
passes for 814 yards, including nine
touchdowns and ﬁve interceptions. Those
numbers add up to an efﬁciency rating of
147.5.

Panthers Note: The starting time of
the Oct. 17 game against Rutgers has
been moved ﬁom 3:30 p.m. to 12 p.m.
The time was changed to accommodate
ESPN regional coverage of the game.
Locally, the game will be seen on WTAE,
Channel 4.

Pitt's defense has held opponents to 259 yards per game.

Joseph? That’s right, CuJo was signed
by the Maple Leafs after becoming a
free agent this summer. He put up
impressive numbers with the Edmonton
Oilers last season and became one of
three top free-agent goalies. With a dis-
appointing 30-43-9 record last year, it
is more than likely that they will
become a better team after making the
investment in their new goalie.

Predicted division finish: lst

Montreal Canadiens —— This impres-
sive offensive and disappointing defen-
sive team most likely will not go’
through too many changes. The
Canadiens were third in the NHL in
power plays last season and only suffer
against teams that come back with
offense while maintaining A a good
defense. __ And that style of play is
prominent in the NHL today, which
makes most teams hard for the
Canadiens to beat. Arecord of 37-32-13
kept the Montreal in the blue, and a
penalty-killing rank of 16th only pulled
it back into the red. If this team empha-
sizes its defensive play a little_ more, it
may become a threat.

Predicted division finish: 2nd

Boston Bruins — A 39-30-13 season
record last year sparked some dim
potential for the Bruins to become what
they once were. Jason Allison should
help the Bruins get back on their feet.

Carolina Hurricanes — Hey, all you
Pittsburgh Penguins fans! Guess who
Ron Francis now calls his home team?
That’s right —‘the Hurricanes. In hopes
of jump- starting its offense, Carolina
signed the ex-Penguin free agent. The
sloppy Hurricanes finished the season
with a record of 33-41-8. After shuf-
ﬂing five different goalies in this past
season, they don’t have much to show
for it. The Hurricanes may do "slightly
better this season, but they are in no
way a threat to most Eastern
Conference clubs. “
Predicted division finish: 3rd

Tampa Bay Lightning — Last and
sadly least are the Tampa Bay
Lightning. They appeared as nothing
more than a cloud, ﬁnishing their 1997-
98 season with a pathetic 17-55-10
record. They signed free-agent Corey
Schwab, ajgoalie who played 16 games
last year and who is among ﬁve differ-
ent goalies Tampa Bay was forced to
juggle. Watch Mikael Renberg, who
has made a solid contribution. since
joining the Lightning at the beginning
of last season. Not much will change
for this club unless it redeems itself in
all offensive and defensive categories.
The team is nearly dead last in all spe-
cial-teams categories, and it scored
only about half as many goals as its
opponents.

Stadium practically empty when
only a continuous drizzle at best fell
over Oakland? There is no fath-
omable answer.

On Monday night, Lambeau
Fieldsaw weather conditions simi-
lar to,Pittsburgh’s on Saturday. The
difference? The stadium _ was
packed. More than 30,000 fans are

‘ on the waiting list for Packer season

tickets to see a majority of games in
tundra-like conditions. ‘

Freezing temperatures,’ tons of
snow and bone—chilling wind can’t
keep these fans away. Light drizzles
and annoying wind are enough to
keep Panther fans away for good.
And for good measure, Columbus,
Ohio, home of the Ohio State
Buckeyes, had similar conditions on
Saturday but had a packed house of
crazy, excited fans.

Others say that the weak compe-
tition, the Akron Zips, kept them
away from Saturday’s game. That’s
interesting, considering everybody’s
favorite neighbor, Penn State, man-
ages to sell out every game, includ-
ing the one against Bowling Green a
few weeks ago. The same can be
said for Michigan, Tennessee,
Nebraska and a host of other schools

that Pitt is striving to reach in terms"

of football playing level and fan
attendance. Pitt has sold more than
8,000 student season tickets to date,
which means there must be some
interest in the team.

then-check out the facts. Student
season packages cost $20. That is
less than $3 a game, considering the
fact that Pitt has seven home games

which is why this price is a steal,
considering that other universities
charge their students $20 or more
for a single game. '

the stadium dedicated to you, the

behalf, where free shirts and other

director, and Harris both vocally
show their appreciation for the stu-
dents’ support at almost every game.

Nowhere! They shouldn’t have to
ask you to go the games, and neither
