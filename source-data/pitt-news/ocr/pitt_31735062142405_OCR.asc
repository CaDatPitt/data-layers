' 9 Y

After sounding out student
opinion on the equal represen-
tation issue Aldo Icardi, newly
elected president of Independ-
ent Association, promised that he
would demand the removal of Al
Minno, C44, Bob Burford, E43, and
Pete Shanta, E43, from the Student-
Faculty association at the next
meeting of the general assembly,
next Wednesday.

,Icardi charged that after being
elected to SFA as Independents,
these men had since pledged fra-
ternity, and were therefore ineli-
gible for membership under the
amendment added to the constitu-
tion last spring, which states that
the assembly members should be
selected from representative groups
——i.e., 16 from the fraternity and
16 from the non-fraternity groups.

In a formal statement Icardi
said, “I accuse Burford and Minno
of breaking trust with the Inde-
pcndents, not because they went
fraternity, but because they refuse
to resign from SFA.” ‘

SFA President Gus Wilde
denied the fraternities pledged
Minno, Burford, and Shanta for
political reasons. He said, “If they
were good enough to be elected to
SFA, I can see no reason why
they should not remain members
as fraternity men.”

The issue was voted upon by the
SFA assembly during its first meet-
ing, and was defeated by one vote.
At that time, seven of the ten fac-
ulty members had not as yet been
appointed and one faculty member
was not present. The only faculty
members who voted were Dean of
men Theodore W. Biddle, and As-
sistant dean of men, Mr. Robert L.

Arthur; both of whom voted that ~

no one should be dismissed from
SFA. When the issue is again
brought before the assembly, the
six other faculty members will have
been appointed. . .

Icardi also said, “I also accuse
the fraternity men who, cognizant
to the spirit of the amendment, are
attempting to maintain minority
rule after having been defeated de-
cisively in the elections of last
Spring.”

Mil, Ball ‘Tickets  
Remain On Sale
On Fourth Floor

Tickets for the military ball to
be held next Friday night are being
sold at the Military department on
the fourth ﬂoor today and will "con-
tinue to be sold until the supply is
exhausted, according to Aldo Icar-
di, C43, publicity chairman. Tickets
are now available to all students as
well as ROTC men at the regular
price of $3.50. . »

This year’s military ball will
again occupy the seventeenth ﬂoor
of the William Penn Hotel from 10
to 2 o’clock and will present the
orchestras of Frankie Masters, Ber-
nie Cummins, and Billy Leoy. Na-
tionally known Frankie Masters
“features as his vocalists Phyllis
Myles and Billy Lowe.

Bernie Cummins, who recently
was featured in the William Penn
Chatterbox, will present as his
songstress Elain Castle. Also fam-
iliar to University students by his
University engagements is the local
orchestra of Billy LeRoy.

' Ladies at the dance will be pre-
sented favors by the military ball
committee, which announces that
this will be a no corsage affair in
compliance with SFA regulations.

With members of the ROTC ap-
pearing in uniform, the military
ball takes its place among the most
impressive University events of the
year. M

Highlight of the military theme
will be the formal military cere-
mony tapping new members into
the honorary military fraternity,
Scabbard and Blade. ’

Traditional features of the mili-
tary ball will be retained, assured
the military ball committee al-
though the affair has been moved
up from its spring date. This year’s
dance will be I 0118 the same lines J

STUDENTS

Courses

ln Basic First Aid

Any girl interested in War activities should take First
Aid for that course is basic training for most civilian defense
workers, according to Mary Rita Keenan, Ed43, chairman

of the war activities committee.
“There is something you can do
now to prepare yourself for things
you will want to do in the future,”
said Mary Rita. _ j I

The First Aid course offered by
the University is the standard
course prescribed by the Red Cross.
It is designed to teach the students
what to do——and what not to do—-
in case of accident or sudden illness.

Approximately 450 trained work-
ers will be needed on campus to
form First Aid crews which will
serve during air raids. Students who
have had First Aid-training in high
school are urged to sign up for
crew work at the Dean of Women’s
oﬂice on the twelfth ﬂoor. Other
students interested in this service
should enroll in First Aid courses
as soon as possible. About 150 day
and evening students have already
been trained but there is a deﬁnite
need for more workers.

“It is not a course which is of
no practical use,” remarked Mrs.
Echia Batz, director of the YWCA

Devotional Services Held
In Heinz Chapel Today

Beginning today, a ﬁfteen minute
devotional service will be held each
Friday in the Heinz Memorial
Chapel. The service will begin at
12:45, and end promptly at 1:00
o’clock. These meetings will be de-
voted not to discussion of problems,
but to the worship of God.

They will be very simple and in-
formal in character, and it is hoped
that many of the student body, the
faculty and the staff may ﬁnd it
convenient and proﬁtable to attend
them.

The leader next Friday is Janet
Lincoln.

and an instructor,-.“and it serves
a two-fold purpose. Not only is it
of use in case of accident or ill-
ness, it also serves a psychologi-
cal purpose. A competent First
Alder creates conﬁdence in a
crowd which otherwise might be-
come terror stricken. A -college
woman is expected to be a leader
and this added skill will heldaher.”
The course requires 20 hours of
the student's time. At the Univer-
sity it is given in two hour periods
once a week by faculty members
who have had instructors’ training.

Chosen Heads
of ll: Dance

At a meeting of the Inter-frater-
nity council executive committee
held last Monday afternoon, John
Syka, E43, and Alex Zelenski, C43,
were chosen to head the annual win-
ter fraternity ball and sing.

_ The IF ball, usually a March
affair, was moved back this year to
accomodate the accelerated senior
fraternity men. The sing compe-
tition will be held the same evening.

Chairman Syka member of Pi
Kappa Alpha, A stated that this
year’s*dance would be open to fra-
ternity men only, and there would
be no possible way for outsiders to
obtain tickets.

Plans for the coming dance are,
as yet, incomplete, but a ‘Christ-
mas, theme will be used. The
dance, as in .other years, will be
held in the Grand Ballroom of the
William Penn Hotel on December

‘ . .. .. Educational leaders, at the last meeting of the American Associ-
ation. of American Colleges, held'last week in Philadelphia, prepared
to make_even more radical changes in their college and university set-up,
 they adopted resolutions calling for:

‘xx =- ,. g I V
- High School Diplomas Unnecessary
: . _1}1. The passing of a standardized scholastic achievement test, rather
, than the possession of a high-school diploma, as admission to colleges
, during war-time. In other words, qualiﬁed youth, even though they.
, haven’t graduated from high-school may be admitted to college.

- 112.. A new curricular concentration of courses, with further empha-
_ sis on Englsh, Math, Physics, Chemistry, American History, Languages,
’ and Physical Fitness.

YNo  More College Football

1[3. The abolition for the duration of intercollegiate football, and
‘ -She substitution of intramural athletics, reaching more of the students.
H4. Compulsory acceleration for women as well as men.

15. Investigations of war positions open to faculty men who will be
‘ last overboard for the duration as education clears its _decks for action.

. These, proposals, members of the association said, are based upon

H I She whole hearted desire of the colleges to cooperate with the war effort.
.-  ; To _this,_,ef’fect_the convention adopted a resolution “wishing it celarl-y
.- ‘understood that: . . . ”

The Colleges Are Not Selfish

, 1. The colleges are not interested in “education as usual” but
are ready and anxious to modify their programs in every possible way
I that will contribute "to the winning" of the war.

' 2. The colleges are notmoved by the desire to protect their
"vested interests}? but place their physical plants, faculty personnel,
and other resources at the immediate service of the Nation.

3. The colleges do not request deferment from military service of
‘college students as such, but urge the selection of youth for college
instruction on the basis of demonstrated ability and democratic equality.

All The College Of The Near Future

- ‘ Here are the proposals, verbatim, adopted by the American Associ-
~ ation of Colleges. It should be the business of every‘ student to read
' them andybecome thoroughly acquainted -with their implications. For
' they foreshadow what our schools and colleges are soon going to be like-_::

_ lts Courage To Experiment t i p
1. .In order) to expedite the education of young men and women

needed for responsible positions in the total war effort, the Association
of American Colleges recognizes the possibility of admitting to college

s  by suitable tests those candidates who meet entrance requirements and
' “I. who are recommended for admission by school principals whether or

‘.2 not they have been graduated from secondary schools. Thus it will be
: possible for a great number to complete at two years of college work
on accelerated programs before reaching the age of 18%, the average

 jg age for induction into the Armed Forces. Tbe’Board is requested to

{discuss this proposal with state departments of education, regional

A  V; accrediting associations, secondary school organizations, and associations

jof graduate and professional schools with aview of securing their advice
~’ and assistance and the necessary legislation to protect students thus
‘ admitted. It is further understood that this measure is intended only for
‘ the duration of the war.

‘its war Courses . . .

2. In view of the needs of educated men and women in the prepara-
tion for commissions in the Armed Forces,’ for. further training in most
necessary professions (such as medicine and engineering). for expert
work in civilian industries imperative for the war machine, the Asso-
oiation of American Colleges recognizes a new curricular concentration
in the first two” years of the college course. The demands of the hour
would require greater emphasis on these college courses: English,
Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, American History (including refer-
ence to European backgrounds and present world situation), certain
Foreign Languages, and Physical Fitness. '

lts Athletics . . ,

3. Because of the present transportation difficulties and other

I patent reasons, the Association of American Colleges’ would suggest

that intramural athletic contests rather than intercollegiate games be

ithegeneral rule for the duration of the ar. A season might be concluded
by a contest beteen two neighboring institutions.

lts Equal Treatment Of Women

4. The greatly increased need of education of women for the war
effort may make it advisable during the war period for women’s colleges
to go on an accelerated program such as was approved at the Annual
{Meeting last January. '

5. Reommend that the colleges and universities endorse the pro-
posal of the Commission on Colleges and Civilian Defense that December
T be observed as a special day with ﬁtting exercises in which there will
be a stock-taking of the war effort for the ﬁrst year, a consideration of
what further cooperation can be given and a rededication to the ideals
of freedom which have already been eliminated from the universities in
Continental Europe.

6. Authorize the Board of Directors to set up a Commission to
survey the situation and to study ways and means of finding places in
the war effort for members of the faculties of the colleges whose services
will not be needed for teaching during the emergency, and to seek funds
lrom the Foundations for this purpose.

7. The Commission on Public Relations be instructed to assist
joolleges in making arrangements with Army, Navy and other Govern-
intent agencies for the use of their facilitieégn-the_ ware

 n..~A M   .   .  in,

By MARTIN H. LUBOVSKY

William P. Witherow, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers is a good—looking man
with an uneven moustache, _.who gives you the impres-
sion that he is less reactionary -than’you thought.
He reminds you of a kindly professor or philanthro-
pist rather than a hard-drivingbusiness man. He is
such a cordial host you feel you -are being rude when
you ask him whether it is true that the N.A.M. is a

pressure group in the interests of big business. "But
he has been expecting the question and is not taken‘

back: “The N.A.M.

M has no lobbyvwhatsoever,” says
Mr. Witherow. v A _' P

so 1ong—held anillusion shattered
that you later look up the Senate’s
Temporary National Economic
Committee’s Investigation of Con-
centration of Economic Power
(TNEC) which found that “busi-
M. H. Lubovsky ness exerts its inﬂuence on indus-

trial relations policy through the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, its members and affiliates, and
other sympathetic organizations. Their inﬂuence is
exercised on behalf of the ‘open shop’ and in oppo-
sition to the ‘closed shop’.” More speciﬁcally the
report actually speaks of “the "N.A.M. . . . lobbying
at Washington.” ‘

“Its (the N.A.M.’s) purpose,’..’, says Mr. ‘Witherow,
“is to present a. knowledge of whatmen of industry

 

-are thinking and to preserve the American system.”

However, the LaFollette Civil Liberties Commit-
tge discovered ‘in’ 1939 that “the purpose of this
prodigious effort (by the N.A.M.) is in part to
forestall union organization, and in part to sway

public opinion in favor of a. legislation program H

approved by the association. . . ”

The “American system,” according to Mr. With-
erow, who also heads’ the Blaw-Knox Company, is
the (“system of free enterprise, free press,‘ free re-
ligion, etc.” . ‘

Mr. Witherow did not know howmuch his organi-
zation (N.A.M.) had spent ‘on advertsiing but knew
that it was about a fraction of what some organiza-
tions spent for that purpose. The LaFollette Com-
mittee report states that “between "1933 and 1938
the association blanketed the country with propa-
ganda which in technique has relied upon indirection
of meaning, and in presentation upon secrecy and
deception.” It takes a goodly sum to blanket fhis
country with chewing gum wrappers let alone pamph-
lets, radio time, etc. ‘ v

Neither had he read the Saturday Evening Post
editorial on Neo-Liberalism, though he had heard
about it, but he wanted to know what I thought
of it. I uttered something to the ‘eﬁect that I con-
sidered it drivel of a low sort. ’ ' .

He concedes that “our system is not perfect”-_-—;
in the sense that nothing  perfect-—-but'believes it
approaches perfection more than any other system
yet devised. “The foundation stpne of the American
system is initiative. Why do we have the largest
amount of oil?” And, answering hisown‘ question,

“Not because we have the greatest reserves, but be-.

cause our initiativehas taken itout of the ground.” \

Interesting in this paragraph from the  ‘
report, “Slogans and cliches have a special —-i_mpo_r-
tance in rendering favorable the circumstances in

. which business chooses to stand against. govern- »

ment. ‘Inalienable rights,’ ‘individual initiative and
effort,’ private ownership and control’ are typical
of those used by the National Association of Manu-
facturers. They are among the essential features
of the ‘American-system.’ They constitute the de-
scription of the economy which business prefers . . ”

The N.A.M. chief related that he had spent many
hours testifying before the Vinson Committee on the
question of time and a half for over 40 hours of work
and at that time, in April, “I didn't recommend a
change in the 40 hour week '. . . but we are coming
to a point where that (manpower) problem. is getting
acute. From a psychological standpoint it (the, 40

‘ hour’ week) seems to present a kind of barrier” to

the war effort. He believes the 40 hour week leads the

worker to consider his job done when he has completed 

40 hours of work. He spoke of the soldiers and sailors  '

working 4 hours a day, 7 days _a week. . A
Encouraging is Mr. Witherow’s beliefithat “In-
dustry by and large has been producing—produc-

ing—producing. There hasn’t been one plant I know -

of that isn’t way ahead of its schedule. 'I‘he,bottlc-
neck is materials, not fabricating production. We
have produced as much in a year-"and a half as
Germany produced inseven years.” V . _ 
Following" several questions.on world aﬁairs, no.-
tionally prominent Mr. Witherow said, “I don’t want
to get involved ‘in any international stuff,” but he did
venture, “My thought on the second, front is that
it is none of my business.” He has been told that:

Russia is departing from Marxism; it is dangerous to g,
base our friendship for the Soviet Union on the belief_ 7:

~ that she is becoming capitalistic; Russia is socialistie
and is striving for greater and greater socialism. v

However Lenin and Stalin have both expressed

belief that it was not only possible but desirable 
. for a‘ socialist nation to live peacefully with a capi-

talist one. If we realistically. recognize this we will

not ‘be disappointed later when we discover the

“Will we have a depression after this war,
Witherow?” I asked.

_ .“I believe there will be a- temporary shock after 
the war. Following the shock there will probablybe _
_a ‘production boom.” He predicts a “great public 

demand.” “By virtue of thebonds and savings (the
public) will have a little cushion to buy these things.”
He‘ revealed that the “N.A.M. is working very hard

. on post-war work. That thought is deeply in the .

 

minds of forward looking industry. It thinks it  *

Mr. Williaim P. Witherow is a self-made main. 
He was given’ an education, but other than that  '

everything he has and has achieved has been
through his own eﬂorts. He is probably the best 1
spokesman ‘the Manufacturers could possibly elect. A

- Byand large his organization has,con_tributed to
national unity. But knowing what we do-of the

H ‘history of ‘the N.A.M., we will be wary of any pfoc 1

-posals. they may make for a post-war world. "As
for me I will follow the leadership of Henry Wal

1 7 Coaching a football_ team that is

having a_ good season is only a fair
job. at its best. Coaching a team that
is having the worst kind of a season
imaginable is enough to make the

‘ coach ‘want “to end it all.”
, Thus it is with coach Charlie

. Bowser. When we spoke to him
' last Tuesday following the Ohio
State debacle he had reached the

',;,‘»‘Th_ank _ God, the ‘season’s nearly

 over’? stage. Perhaps Pitt’s head
all grid mentor would not have felt
 '  bad hadhis team made an ef-

fort ‘to win last week. But, as he
-put it, “We didn’t play football.”

 Bowser went on to say that Pitt "-
had faced Ohio State at its best e

and at Pitt’s Worst. He stated,
“They (Ohio State) were rebound-
ing. Theirrunning was fast and
hard. Their tackling was sharp. We
were at our worst.”

It was evident that Bowser was a.

’ bit fed up over the lack of effort his

team-showed against the Buckeyes.
While he wasn't alibying for the
-walloping inﬂicted by Paul Brown's
team, he did mention that Pitt has
been hampered by injuries. _
“If we had been at our peak
Saturday,” Bowser declared, “we

 would have given them a good ball

game. Bu't——they were too goodfor
us.”

Bowser paid special tribute to the

Ohio State backs. He said that they

‘ had some of the best backs in the

country and all in all their backﬁeld
was too powerful. Also, the team
that played -against the Panthers
Batunday was the best playing out-
ﬁt that has faced Pitt this season.
That is, while they may not be the

, best team that battled the Jungle-

cats this year, the game they played

:_ was the best.

Pitt Penny Plan
Proves Profitable

Twelve thousand more pennies
have been exchanged by the Pitt
Penny Plan since last Tuesday,
bringing the total to date to 114,000.-
According to Dr. J. Ellwood Amos,
associate professor of ﬁnance, the
drive is well on its way toward
its goal of having students trade
in one ton of pennies.

The booth operated by freshmen
Business Administration students,
has been moved to the ground ﬂoor
opposite the bulletin board. Dr.
Amos emphasized that they are not
collecting pennies but exchanging
them. Therefore, students will re-
ceive cash for all pennies they turn
in.

The purpose of the campaign is
to collect pennies and return them
to circulation, in order to reduce the
amount of copper that that the
mint must «user than relieving the

By ELAINE KAHN

 

There is norest for the weary, and so the battered Pan-
thers will take to the football ﬁeld once again tomorrow when

they take on the Cornhuskers from Nebraska in what will
the ﬁnal home game of the season. _ .
The Panthers managed to escape from Ohio State with, v

be

all hands safe and so they should be in fairly good form‘
against the Cornhuskers. George Allshouse is still out with

a bad leg and so Jim Clowes will
continue to pinch hit. The lineup will
again show Sotak, Durishan, Mat-

tioli, Clowes, ‘ Antonelli, Salvucci

and Kyle in the front lines, with

West, Dutton, Stetler, and Saksa

in the backﬁeld.

After last Saturday it should be
fairly apparent that whoever gave
the Panthers the advice to “go West
young men, go west” was either a_
saboteur or else was just badly in
need of compass, for discounting the
three disastrous visits to the west-
ern territories, the Panthers sport
a respectable if not impressive
home record of two wins and two
"defeats. Although Nebraska is not
too strong this year, a fact indi-
cated by their record of three wins
in seven starts, they are held to be
slight favorites over the downtrod-
den Pitts. i ' * '
Only point in Pitt’s favor is the
fact that they were able to bounce
back from the 50-7 defeat handed
them by Minnesota to whip SMU.
Nebraska lost to Missouri last

Saturday 26-6, but Missouri h_as_an‘-

extremely good team this year and
were “up” for the Nebraska tus-
sle. This is one loss that can not
be held against the Cornhuskers.
For Nebraska, Jack Hazen will
be at left end, Vic Schleich at left
tackle, and Chuck Duda, a junior
who played outstanding ball last
year, at left guard. Joe Partington
takes over at center. Right guard
Wayne Stranathan, Tackle Joe

Byler, and End Marvin Thompson
make up the line. Nebraska is ‘rich
in quarterbacks, possessing two
unusually good ones in Fred Meth-
eny and Bob Cooper. It is expected,
however, that Metheny will get the
nod over Cooper in tomorrow’s con-
test. 1
Dale Bradley, one of the out-

standing ball carriers in the n\id- I

dle-west last year will be at "left
half. Bradley is Nebraska’s triple
threat man and is reported to be
an especially shifty runner. The
right halfback slot will be ﬁlled
by Allen Zikmond who scored one

of the touchdowns in Nebraska’si

1940 Rose Bowl game ‘with Stan-

ford, while Kirwin Eisenhart who -. I

occupies the fullback position is

considered a real “ﬁnd” and is c-x- ‘

pected to develop into a great
back. ' ' ‘ 
Incidentally, the Panthers may
break one of their own records to-
morrow, although it will be a highly
dubious -honor. For if the C n_-
huskers can score_ as many as 1
points against, the Panthers, the
Panthers, the record set in 1903
when 197 points were scored aga' t
them will be tied. If the Cornhup -
ers make mordthan_2-1 points a new
record will be established.
But then things won’t be too bad

if the Junglecats only come back '

next year to equal the 1904 record

when only ﬁve points were scored

against them.

System to Win 1943 Games

Pitt’s I942-43 basketball team --

will go back about 15 years this
season by picking up the system
used by the highly successful 1927-
28 team.

In that year, what is commonly
termed the “over and around"
type of offense was used. In this,
the man who receives the ball is
in front of the passer, and he in
turn is met by a man or men who
are in front of him, and who are
his potential receivers.

The next year found a major dif-
ference in the offensive style of the
Golden Basketeers. Instead of the
receiver being in front of the passer,
he would out behind him, or to his
rear across the court, so that the
passer would be in a good blocking
position. I

Dr. Carlson calls this, "A change
from a blitz to a sitz type of
offense.” The good doctor’s reason-
ing clears when we watch an oppos-
ing guard come in contact with the
rear of the Panther who has just
passed.

The many ‘Carlson systems we

have seen since that date have
been based upon that one common
feature, passer in front of receiver.
Last year’s continuity, or pass-
and-cut, "system was also based on
that primary oﬁensive gesture.

This year’s offense promises to
be different from that of last year’:
in that one main feature. Com-
ments on the success of the change
muist necessarily await the season’s

Practice so far this season has
been limited to drills in the funda-

schedule makes great demands upon

the stamina of any team.

As Part Cl University Medical Center‘?

This the third in a series of
articles about parts of Pitt which
are unfamiliar to the general stu-
dent body. This newest addition to
the Pitt Medical Center has re-
ceived nationwide comment.

Insanity is not the primary re-
search objective of the new two and
a half million dollar Western Penn-
sylvania Psychiatric H o s p i t a 1 ,
which is now part of the Univer-
sity Medical Center.

Dr. G. P. Pearson, superintend-
ent, outlines the general institution
program as the study of mental ill-
ness and their corresponding treat-
ments.

Physical illnesses that have
psychological c o m p 0 n e n t s and
psychological diseases that have
physical complications, such as
heart disease when a wild delirium
confuses the picture or hysteria
which is followed by temporary
blindness, are phases of research
that cover a large part of the hos-
pital’s ﬁeld. Problems of child delin-
quency that can be explained -and

Play for University

For a half hour each morning and
between classes each day, Pitt stu-
dents play the Hammond Electric
Organ 'which is located in an alcove
on the third ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

In answer to the queries of those
who have asked the purpose of the
music, Miss Helen Pool Rush, dean
of women, stated, “I think the mu-
sic ﬁts in with the whole architec-
ture of the Commons Room and the
entire idea of the University. It just
seems to belong to everything for
which our school stands.”

Student organists, who volun-
teered and now play regularly are:
Catherine Kenyon, C45, Priscilla
Lentz, C46, Marjorie Beal, C43, Vir-
ginia King, C46, Lewis Carpenter,
C45, and George Currier, Ed44.
