Industry Students Close Term.
With Modem Cool M inc Tour

A 10-mile subterranean tour
through one of the world’s most
modern bituminous coal mines cli-
maxed the semeste~1"s “laboratory”
sessions of the University’s indus-
try courses last Thursday afternoon.

Some 25 students, led by Jacob
Blair, instructor in economics,
toured the Wildwood mine of the
Butler Consolidated Coal company
ploughing through coal mud in
freezing weather on the trip which
supplemented classroom study on
the Guﬁey bituminous coal act.

Explained to them by W. P.
Vance, mine superintendent, was the
revolutionary change in mining
brought about by the introduction of
mechanization. Mr. Vance told the
students that the old time notion
that the coal miner represented
the lowest type of American worker
must be changed, because coal mi-
ners of today are skilled machine

operators, each of whom is ﬁgured
in an interdependent system of
mass production“ methods.”

The students, equipped with safe-
ty lamps, made a complete tour of
the underground diggings. They de-
scended 350 feet to the coal seam,
were herded into coal cars which
were towed by electric locomotives,
and were taken to actual work sites.
They saw coal seams being drilled
for dynamite sticks, exploded, cut,
and loaded.

Another tour of the mine will be
made this evening by other indus-
try students. On Thursday’s trip,
virtually all of Mr. Blair's second
hour section made the tour, with
the exception of the class’s only wo-
man student, Jane Ward, C42.

Asked why she did not go, Miss
Ward commented, “Oh, I washed
my hair once this week!”

National Guard Will Use

Alumni Hall

as Barracks

Following a precedent established during the first World War, Alumni
hall will be used for barracks in the quartering of soldiers before they
go on to encampment, it was learned Friday through the University ad-

ministration.

The University is cooperating with the One Hundred and Seventy-

sixth Field Artillery of the Penn-
sylvania National Guard, Pitts-
burgh unit, which is expected to be
called to camp between February
10 and 15. On the assumption that
the unit will be ordered out, officers
are planning to give members a
week to 10 days of preliminary in-
struction in the Oakland district.

Alumni hall, undergoing altera-
tions for chemistry laboratories,
will be used as sleeping quarters by
some members of the artillery unit.
Since the building operations are
about 50 per cent complete, sleeping
quarters will be available for 60 to
100 men.

Instruction for the guardsmen
will be carried on in Cathedral
class rooms which will be available«'«‘
since University classes will not
meet between semesters.

This move is among the many
being made by the University to
cooperate with the various phases of
the national defense prograam.

The School of Engineering has
enrolled over 1,000 outside students
in special defense training courses
in night classes which started a
week ago. Over a fourth of these
courses, listed as productive engi-~
neering, are given in the old Shady-
side academy building, Morewood
and Ellsworth avenues, which the
University has leased.

The building will be used for the
defense courses at night and for
regular University classes and
laboratories in industrial engineer-
ing in the daytime. The adjacent
playing ﬁeld will be used by the
physical education department in
teacher training courses.

The University’s defense train-
ing program includes, besides
courses in production planning and
control, mechanical drawing, de-
scriptive geometry, machine de-
sign, and metallurgy. This program
is conducted inconnection with the
U. S. Ofﬁce of Education’s plan to
‘train men speciﬁcally for industry.

The University has granted leaves
of absence to several faculty and
staff members who are oﬁi-cers and
reserves in various military units.
In addition, the 30 students who are
nww completing the course offered
by the University in cooperation
with the Civil Aeronautics author-
ity, have pledged to enlist in U. S.
air services.

Women Debaters
To Present Panels

Initiating a busy week for the
Women’s Speech association, Helen
Becker, C43, Dorothy Hanlon, C43,
Mary Sarantopoulos, C43, and Har-
riet Wertkin, C41, will take part in
a panel discussion of “The Perma-
ment Union with the Americas” be-
fore the Allegheny County League
of Women Voters at 2 o’clock to-
morrow afternoon.

WSA will combine with Men’s
Debating association tomorrow to
sponsor a panel discussion by rep-
resentatives of city colleges and an
open forum in 1228 Cathedral at 5:30
o’clock. Question for discussion
will be “Should the United States
Feed Victims of Nazi Aggression?”

Chairmaning the evening will be
Esther Marcuson, C41, while Eliza-
beth Krowich, C41, and Sam Rod-
gers, C41, will speak, along with
representatives from Tech, PCVV,
and Mt. Mercy. The program will
also include a South American din-
ner priced at 40 cents. Students
and faculty members are invited by
the association to sign up for the
event in 1213 Cathedral.

Town Meeting
Hears Graper

Professor Analyzes
Effects of Election

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the department of po-
litical science, will speak at Pitt
Town Meeting today at 2:30 o’clock
in 244 Cathedral on the results of
the recent presidential election and
their eﬁects on domestic and for-
eign affairs.

Dr. Graper, former professor of
political science at Columbia uni-
versity, will also analyze" possible
congressional action in the seventy-
seventh Congress as concerns the
present rearmament program and
the foreign policy of the adminis-
tration.

The talk which Dr. Graper will
present to students and faculty
members today will be hinged en-
tirely on the ﬁnal result of the late
presidential election. He will show
the influence of the present admin-
istration on government legislation
now and probable future legisla-
tion.

The next Pitt Town Meeting will
be a panel discussion on general
education in which several mem-
bers of the faculty will participate.
The discussion will take the form
of an informal symposium in which
members of the faculty will ex-
change opinions and arguments.

Some time in March, Miss Marcu-
son announces, Pitt Town Meeting
will feature a series of meetings on
the subject of marriage and do-
mestic affairs.

Recommending Permanence . . .
Provost Describes Temporary
University Council’ s Progress

Progress of the temporary Uni-
versity council was summarized to-
day after the ﬁnal meeting of the
council, which took place Friday
a week ago, by Rufus H. Fitzger-
ald, University provost and chair-
man of the council.

Recommendation for a perma-
nent council was approved by the
group, Mr. Fitzgerald revealed,
and a constitution has been decided
upon, but was referred back to the
committee for minor editing.

The ﬁndings of the council will
be presented to the Chancellor, who
will give it to the Board of Trustees
with whom the ﬁnal decision of per-
manence rests.

The temporary council was
formed, after a suggestion by the
board, last February to serve for
one year and to make recommen-
dations in regard to the desirability
of establishing a permanent council.

During the board meeting Feb-
ruary 6, a decision on the recom-
mendations of the council is expect-
ed to be reached.

If permanently established, the
University council will serve as an
advisory board of 68 members—-
administrative oﬁicer and faculty—
to advise on educational and admin-
istrative procedure and policies.

Mr. Fitzgerald declined to detail
the work of the council, for he said
that nothing could be revealed un-
til a decision is reached by the
board. The decisions of the coun-
cil, he reminded, are just recommen-
dations at present.

Gideonse Speaks

At Forum Tonight

“The Place of the Thinking Per-
son in the World Crisis” wil.l be the
topic discussed by Dr. Harry D.
Gideonse, president of Brooklyn
college, when he speaks tonight at
8:15 o’clock before the Pittsburgh
Community forum in Schenley High
school auditorium.

Dr. Gideonse, one of the origina-
tors of the University of Chicago
round table, has been noted as a
ﬁghter for his convictions. He re-
signed as an assistant professor at
the University of Chicago in protest
against President Robert Maynard
Hutchins’ educational theories.

‘Democracy Committee’

Discusses Third Term

A round table discussion on “The
Third Term” will feature the Edu-
cation for Democracy committee
meeting today at 3:30 o’clock in
the conference room off the sixth
floor reserve book room. The dis-
cussion is open to all students and
faculty members.

The committee, under the chair-
manship of Virginia Porter, C42, is
also planning a series of panel dis-
cussions and debates before wo-
men’s organizations. A table of
current events reading material is
maintained by the committee in
the periodical room.

 

TE Discusses
Pledge Council

‘Fledge’ Group Union
Sought by Nicholas

, A if-’ml301‘31“.V Dlan for an inter-
fraternity pledge council was intro-
duced at the Interfraternity coun-
cil meeting last Tuesday by Her-
cert Nicholas, E44. president of the
Pledge group of Phi Delta Theta.
The plan. as presented by Nicholas
IS intended to give interfraternity
cooperation an early start among
the pledge groups of every house.

There were six main purposes of
the plan as presented for considera-
tion by the council. Probably the
one of greatest importance is an at-
tempt to make the fraternity ring
stronger by inter-cooperation of all
houses. Second, pledges will get
to know each other by working to-
gether.

Better Relations

There will also be an attempt to ,

improve faculty and alumni rela-
tions with each fraternity. This
will be done by more intimate con-
tact with faculty Winemberst and
graduates.

The next two purposes are: to
raise standards of fraternity men in
manners, adherence to fraternity
rules, etc.; and to raise scholastic
standards by perhaps offering
awards to high ranking pledges.

“The idea has merit,” was the
opinion of Al Ludwig, BA4l, presi-
dent of IF council. “‘It will also
give valuable background to the
freshmen, sophomores, and juniors
who will be members of IF coun-
cil in the coming years. The coun-
cil fully approves of Nicholas’
plan.”

Provide Joint Meetings

‘Joint meetings with the execu-
tive committee of its “big brother”
will oﬁer a connection for the coun-
cil with the group making the laws.
The plan’s fate rests in the hands of
presidents of the various pledge
classes.

The ﬁrst meeting of the new
council will be an organization
meeting in 204 Cathedral at 3:30
o’clock this afternoon. At this
meeting the executives will decide
on a plan of representation.

SFA Appoints
Election Heads

The SFA executive committee is
taking no chances on this year’s
elections. At least that’s the way
it seems as appointment of co-
chairmen for the general student
elections is announced.

Fred Robie, Ed41, Independent,
and David T. Buente, C41, Delta
Tau Delta, both members of the ex.
ccutive committee, were selected to
take charge of all arrangements for
the spring elections. In past years
one man has had complete charge
of the whole affair.

Rae Young, C41, was appoint-
ment chairman of the appointments
committee, succeeding Roger Pow-
ell, E41, who resigned because of
Dressure of outside work. The fol-
lowing were chosen as the senior
memorial committee: Adele Yorio,
Ed41; Grace McCombs, Ed41; Gene
Pyle, C41; Albert Klimcheck, Uni-
versity architect; Theodore W. Bid-
dle, assistant dean of men; Helen
Pool Rush, assistant to the dean of
women; Al Ludwig, BA41; and E.
Allen Holbrook Jr., E41.

A committee was appointed to in-
vestigate the possibility of publish-
mg the answers to student ques-
tions by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man at an SFA-sponsored assem-
bly. Heading it will be Ben Foote,
C41. Other members are: Robie
and Dr. Ellen Geyer, professor of
English.

Added to the committee for Schol-
ar’s day were Irving Kaufman, C41,
and Dorothy Wcincr, C43-

The Pitt News

{Essie rihiﬁng’ Stnclellt Goverlniient

A CONSTITUTIONAL revision committee,
formed to bring about an improvement in Pitt
student government, has issued a call for sug-

gestions from all University students. As stu-
dents, ourselves, and as custodians of the organ
wh.ich expresses student thought, the editors of
the Pitt News answer the call of the committee.

‘Ne believe that there is too much student
government at Pitt and not enough student gov-
erning. There are too many organizations pos-
ing as legislative councils for all men, all
women, fraternity men, fraternity women, all
men and women, ad disgustuin. These organiza-
tions do not know where their authority begins
or where it ends. They do not know what they
are supposed to do. Their constitutions are mi-
nutely outlined series of abstractions. They do
not know the relationship between one student
group and another group or between any group
and the faculty.

Better student government at Pitt cannot be
accomplished by revamping one group. It takes
a reorganization of each student group, a reor-
ganization not limited to the needs of that par-
ticular group, but one patterned on the rela-
tionship that group bears to others.

Some of the‘ student groups should be abol-
ished. lVIen’s council is a case in point.

According to the Pitt Compass, “Men’s coun-
cil sponsors: Men’s Student Loan fund; men’s
customs and traditions; freshman customs; ac-
tivities for men transfer students; improvement
of campus conditions in general; careful study
of all problems pertaining to men students; and
the Men’s council book exchange.”

The purpose of Men’s council, according to
its constitution, “shall be the administration of
all activities pertaining to the men students at
the University of Pittsburgh.”

In actual practice, Men’s council does not
perform its speciﬁc functions adequately. In
actual practice, these functions do not make up
“the administration of all activities pertaining
to men students.” In actual practice, Men’s
council is nothing but a second-rate organiza-
tion composed of second or third-rate members.

To understand Men’s council, you must be
familiar with the method of election to the
group. In the first place, it is virtually a fra-
ternity monopoly because it’s hard for the in-

“Intercollegiate

A ﬂying trip through college editorial pages nets
the impression that most college students are still
doing their best thinking about the United States’ re-
lation to the war.

Almost all of the papers are pessimistic when they
discuss the immediate future, and all idealistic with
respect to what they think they are ﬁghting for.

Only a few have deﬁnite hopes for the future. The
University of Colorado’s Silver and Gold is optimistic,
because they believe there is plenty to do in the
world. A letter in the Harvard Crimson chides the
freshmen who “waved gallantly the British Jack and
sang with their Groton accents for the eternity of the
British Empire.” The letter proposes that in lieu of
saving the British empire, we give up certain empty
ideals, those of “warmongers or misdirected intellectu-
al.s.""‘ And “A future lies before us, if only we can
open our eyes to it, in which men may live sincerely
and to the best of their ability.”

Aid For Britain

Sentiment for aid to Britain ranges all the way
from suspicion of the president to friendly obituaries
of the late Lord Lothian.

"Interventionist—war-monger” is the title bestowed
on William Allen White by a Northwestern University
‘columnist. Another columnist on the same paper is
critical of the whole ‘administration stand.

The University of Il.linois through the Daily Illini,

‘appears anti—war, and besides -doesn’t believe Britain‘

is ﬁghting our battle. With respect to Britain, the
Illinians believe “this war is her baby, not ours,” but

‘though they’re willing to sell armaments to her,  _
'don’t believe Britain will be able to pay in 

after the war. Nor do they believe that U.‘ S. ‘mandi-
facturers will accept payment in kind.

*-Collcgirtns Oppose War

An article in the Kansas State Collegian held that
American collegiate body opposes war because they
were taught that the last war was a swindle, and that
there are more than two sides to a question. This,
Mortimer Adler says, unﬁts them morally to ﬁght a
war."-' A -
But The Kentucky Kernel called Roosevelt’s speech

“the guttiest speech on foreign policy ever made by
and American’ president.” And the Daily Texan
doesn’t want to limit aid to Britain. The Texan be-
lieves we will go to war, but is willing to gamble
with the president on a chance for staying out.

The Texan echoes the Tennessee Collegian: “All
aid to Britain, but Britain must pay in cash" as long
as she can, and then the U. S. will “cancel the ﬁve
‘and 'one-half billion debt for a hundred year lease on
Canada and Bermuda. For further ﬁnancial assistance
let England turn over to us the Honduras and Guiana,
the islands of Barbados, Greneda,‘ Montserrat, and
Martinique, too vital to Caribbean defense.”

All Out With Mr. R.

The Daily Iowan is completely collective security
for U. S. and Britain—all the way with Roosevelt.
And the Swarthmore Phoenix, a fellow Pennsylvanian,
asks all aid to Britain. The Phoenix commented fav-

The Queen’s Journal, of Queen’s University, Canada,
lauded the President’s ﬁreside chat.

The Journal also congratulated the “Levana and
Arts Society Formal committee for their splendid
action in diverting money formerly spent on corsages
‘toward a bigger war effort.”

dependents to line up three or four slatefuls of
votes.

The fraternity men, however, do not place
their best men on the Men’s council slates, re-
serving their glamor men for SFA, and relegat-
ing weak houses and second choice men for dis-
tribution on the Men’s council ticket.

These men are the ones who are charged
with the administration of the customs and
traditions program for freshman men. It is
they who sponsor one smoker during the entire
year and are content to call this one night’s
program “activities for transfer men.” It is
they who form the bulk of orientation advisers
and it is they who are accredited with the spon-
sorship of the freshman judiciary tribunal.

It is obvious that under the present set-up
the student administrators of these vital train-
ing programs are not the best men the Univer-
sity can place in the positions.

Dr ids, honorary activities fraternity for
sophomore men, is more qualiﬁed to direct the
customs and traditions program for freshmen.
l\/lembers of this organization represent, as near
as possible, the most successful leaders in fresh-
man activities. (The “old system of political
pay-offs in Druids has been virtually eliminated
since the merit system was instituted two years
ago.)

ODK could assume student sponsorship of
the freshman judiciary tribunal, inasmuch as
most of the justices sitting at every year’s cere-
mony are ODK men.

As for the non-training phases of the Men’s
council program, there remain two main activi-
ties-—the men’s student loan fund and the book
exchange.

The two are related. From the proceeds of
the exchange Men’s council gets money for the
loan fund. The loan fund is small and the book
exchange is under-publicized. Both should be
taken over by a larger organization and par-
ticipated in by both men and women.

A reorganized Student Faculty association
could operate more successfully many of the
functions of Men’s council and those of other
“padded” student government organizations on
campus.

(On Wednesday we shall discuss College as-
sociation and in subsequent issues deal with
other student “legislatures.” )

‘Sing a Song of Six pence’ GctsNew Meaning

And, Surprise, It’s Not for Chill’un At All

classroom tales.

The theme, frankly, is to be entertainment rather than
These, we think, are the things we will remember when
The following is from Mr. George W. Carver’s

class in English biography, and is written by Freda Valli]

In a day of subtleties and satire
and New Yorker cartoons, it is
heartening to realize that other ages
had their ﬂings at the old double
entendre. Take the following:

Sing a song of sixpence,
Pocket full of rye, '

Four and twenty blackbirds,
Baked in a pie.

When the pie was opened,
The birds began to sing,

Now wasn’t that a dainty dish,
To set before the king?

The king was in the counting-house,
Counting out his money,

The queen was in the parlor,
Eating bread and honey.

The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,

Along came a blackbird,
And bit off her nose.

That poem, to you and me, lived
quite a long life as a simple nursery
rhyme. Now there comes along a
socially signiﬁcant interpretation
that utterly maims the childlike
naivete of the composition.

The pie, it seems, referred to a
man named Pye, who was at one

time poet laureate of England. Pye

was a nature lover. He would walk
through the ﬁelds of England and
throw food to the birds. This was
the pocket full of rye. He was

commissioned to do a certain
amount of poetry for the king and
was placed on a pension. This ac-
counts for the song of sixpence.

The king, as you probably have
not guessed by now, was Henry
VIII, who had a terriﬁc penchant
for handling the coins of his realm.
Henry loved to play with money
and diamonds and other pieces.

The queen was the wily Cath-
erine, who was from Aragbn in
Spain, where they produced a good
bit of honey, as witness Kate.

The maid was one Anne Boleyn,
a mistress—of the robes. The ﬁnal
blackbird was the black—hooded
executioner who separated Anne
from her nose and considerable
other portions of her.

Stick around a few hundred
years for the latest translations of
“Beat Me Daddy” and “The Music
Goes ’Round and ”Round."

§Williams Stresses U. S. International Position,

Internal Power in Paper for Historical Body

[Editor’s Note—Dr. Williams has permitted the News exclusive re-
production of the press summary of his paper on “American Leadership
in the Non-Totalltartan World,” read at the annual meeting of the Amer-
ican Historical association, in New York city, December 30, 1940.]

0 By Dr. Benjamin H. Williams 0
In this cataclysmic period one of
the most revolutionary of all
changes is that which is taking
place in international position and
power of our own country. The
particular direction of our diplo-
matic shift is toward greater re-
sponsibilities and leadership in the
non-totalitarian world.

Certain highly developed Euro-
pean nations of which Germany and
Italy are the leading examples, are
seized with acute frustration. They
suffer from a blocked desire for ter-
rltorial expansion which has been
obstructed by the jealous highly
nationalistic state system of Europe.
This leads them into frantic and
destructive efforts to improve their
position. I

In the outer regions of western
civilization afribpg large and terri-
torially satisﬁed} nations, such as
those of the Western ‘Hemisphere,

Australia, New Zealand, etc., con-
ditions of easier life prevail. Di-
plomacy here can be rewarded by
greater gains and is fraught with
less peril than in the more belliger-
ent Old VVOrld.

Various factors are rapidly pro-
pelling the United States into the
acceptance of greater responsibili-
ties and leadership. The unrivalled
productive capacity of the United
States creates here a high pressure
economic area from which ‘goods
and capital tend to flow outward.
ODefensive Imperialism

The defense motive impels this
country to do three things: (1) to
expand into strategic defense posi-
tions beyond ~- our borders; (2) to
build up a powerful military force
primarily for security but capable
also of backing up a stronger for-
eign policy and of giving prospec-

Particularly at this time is the
working of balance of power psy-
chology to be seen in American of-
ficial statements. The President

has stressed the danger to the»

United States from a victory by
totalitarian countries; and the fear
of rising dictator nations stimu-
lates American aid to the nations
which oppose them, that is, to Great
Britain, Greece, and China.

ePcaccful Means -

As a matter of post-war plan-

ning for American leadership in
the non-totalitarian world, it would
appear that our diplomatic inter-
ests will be served better by the
doctrines of peace and cooperation
than by. the Machiavellianism with
which the totalitarian nations seek
to achieve their ends.

Peaceful means are the methods
of our true interest for. the reasons
that we can fulﬁll large ambitions
without territorial conquest and
that an offensive policy on our part
will drive many of our prospective
friends into the camp of our oppo-
nents in a world balance of power
system. ‘

Fine Concert

5 By can Garland

I Making his fourth appearance in
ﬁve years with the Pittsburgh Sym-

phony orchestra, last Friday night. I

Sergei Rachmaninoff played his
own Concerto No. 3 in D minor,
which, in 1904, had won the Glinka
prize and established him as a com-
poser-pianist of distinction‘.

Under the baton of Dr. Fritz
Reiner, Rachmaninoff was again at

his best and one of the greatest -'

musicians among pianists.

Though a contemporary," Rach-
maninoff is by no means a musical
moderrdst. His music is marked,
nevertheless, by a conservatism
that creeps through his»individual—
ity. In his third concerto for piano
and orchestra which the pianist
are reflections from the
personality of the composer him-
self; sober, serious, and with an
almost melancholy exterior, he con-
ceals a warm personality.

The opening of the concerto is
sombre, yet within two measures
the piano sings a melody that over-
comes this gloomy atmosphere with
a surging .drive. Throughout the
ﬁrst move there is a wholesome,
not morbid, and melancholy touch,
but it is warm with vitality.

Sidelines
With Bill lVIcElwain

Sports Editor

This man Carlson, whom you may remember as Pitt’s basketball
coach, is always a good news source. It seems that the doctor 1s
recommending a change in the floor rules affecting the three second
rule in the foul circle. Under the present rules, if a. member of the
offensive team stays in the defensive team ’s foul circle or foul lane
for. more than three seconds, the ball goes to the defensive team out
of bounds.

But, says Dr. Carlson, this develops into a completely unfair
regulation when the defensive team goes into a zone defense. A zone
defense, for the beneﬁt of the uninitiated,  one in which the defen-
sive tea.m spreads out ﬁve tall men in front of their basket, usually
three men in the front line and two in the back line, and waits for
the offense to do something about. it.

.ZoneiWrecI:s Offense

An effective zone, which refuses to be drawn out of position, can
pu.t!_t'he damper on practically any oﬁense extant, for the defensive
positions taken serve to break up almost any plays operating through
the foul lane. The burden on the offense, the good doctor claims, is
all. out of proportion with the passive resistance of the defense.
VVha.t’s.more, when the offense gives up in disgust and begins to
charge for the basket, the traffic problem becomes most acute.

To remedy the condition, Dr. Carlson would make it illegal for
any member of either team to remain in the foul circle or foul lane
more than three seconds. The penalty against the offensive team
would remain the same, but should a defensive man stay too long in
the forbidden territory, the offense would be awarded a free shot
from the outer rim of the foul circle, and the ball returned to them
on completion of the play. This the doctor defends on the grounds
that the offense had the ball at the time the foul was committed.

According to Carlson. the zone defense would be practically
eliminated (More elimination offense, Doc?) by such a. rule, since
one principle of the zone requires that the center man in the front
line plant both feet’ ﬁrmly in the foul circle. This is equivalent to
putting up a pillar on the free throw line (For anyone who has tried
to peer around the c(>lun1ns in the Stadium and watch a game, an-
other pillar more or less is no drawback).

Easier on Oﬁcials

A ‘The change which Carlson proposes is based almost entirely on
theory for it has never been tried out in actual competition, but the
doctor sees it as a distinct improvement. In the ﬁrst place, he points
out, it would make it easier for the ofﬁcials since they would merely
watch for a pair of feet to stick around in no-man’s-land too long,
w'herea_s now they must be sure that the feet belong to a member of
the offense. '

In reply to the charge that his proposal would slow up the game
by adding an additional type of foul, Dr. “Carlson claims it would
have exactly the opposite eﬁect. Once defensive players became used
to the rule, they would break it but seldom, certainly no oftener than
they might now, using a man-to-man defense. Charging fouls, fre-
quent against a zone defense, would be fewer. Most. important, to
the doctor ’s way of thinking, the practicability of the zone defense
would be rui11ed, the way woul.d be open for offensive" plays to oper-
ate, and the net result, higher scoring games, would please-the fans

no end.

The fact that the doctor’s pet ﬁgure-eight offense looks pretty
impotent against a zone has nothing to do with the proposal, of

course.

WIAA Jottings

After. acting as a silent partner
in the organization during this se-
mester, the outing club of the
Women’s Athletic Association will
sponsor its ﬁrst week-end partyvof
the"‘ye_ar.' As usual, the outing will
be held at Laurel Ridge. .

Scheduled f or the week-end fol
lowing examinations, this will be
a grand chance to recuperate from
the grind. The group will leave at
1 o"cl0cl<: on Friday, January 31,
and will return to Pittsburgh at
about 7 o’clock Sunday evening,
February 2.

Plans for the snowy week-end
are being organized, according to
Gail Brendlinger, C41, chairman
of the event. She hopes to include
in the program ice-skating, to-
bogganing, bob-‘sledding, and ‘ ski-
ing. V‘ ' 1

Cost of the _week-end will be
$3.25, which willtake‘ care of every-
thing, including "trarisportation.

WAA bowling is being "held reg-
ularly every Tuesday afternoon
from 2:30 o’clock until 5:30 o’clock
at the ‘University Recreation alleys,

located on Craig street near Forbes. ’

For the convenience of the mem-
bers of the organizjation,"WAA has
reserved the .second ﬂoor of .the
building for their use. Reduced
rates have ,,_also_~been given to the
students. .

Remaining weeks of this semester
are to be spent practicing up for
the tournaments which will begin
with the new semester. Each or-

ganization on campus should be.

looking ahead and begin organizing
a team to ‘represent them.

planning on holding a tournament
for both men and women, the ﬁrst
tournament of its kindto be held

Pitt Baseballers Prepare for Spring,

As Mittcrlirzg Calls 0ut,.B

Practically an entirely veteran
team will be on hand this year to
open the 19-11 baseball schedule
which finds the Panthers makin.9,'
nine trips to foreign diamonds
and four to the Stadium turf.

With the actual season more than
two months away, head mentor
Ralph Mitterling has already issued
his call for pitchers and catchers.
The batterymen are to report to
gate three of the Stadium today at
3:30 o’clock. However, Panther
athletes will not begin actual prac-
tice until after the semester exami-
nations are completed.

Veterans Return

Today’s meeting will be primar-
ily to get the baseballers into the
preliminary stage of the campaign.
Practice sessions will be held two
or three times weekly following the
ﬁnal exams.

A large number of veterans from
last season plus a wealth of sopho-
more material gives evidence that
this may be the year that Pitt base-
ball followers have been waiting
for. In their two seasons of base-
ball since the sport Was revived, the
Panthers have ﬁnished on the los-
ing side of the ledger.

Inﬁelders returning from the 1940
schedule will include second base.-
man Al Holbrook, third basemen
Ernie Bonelli, Larry Katz, and J ohn
Vaiksnor, and ﬁrst sacker Lefty
Ziolkowski. Behind the plate, the
Blue and Gold will be well supplied
with Guy Guadagnino. Frank
Goelz and Al Bush will return to
outﬁeld duty.

Several Newcomers

The only spot lacking plenty of
veterans is the pitching department.
Here the Panthers will have to
bank on footballer Eddie Jones,
sophomore Jack Chiurazzi, and Joe
Treolo. Backing up this trio will
be Ed Haluska and Joe Pommer-
schein.

Newcomers to the Pitt nine will
be catcher Art Bariska, ﬁrst sacker
Johnny Brown, pitcher Wilk, and
inﬁelders Kuzman, Williams, and
Jacobs. All reported for the pre-
liminary drills this fall.

Unbeaten SAM

. Five Challenges

Phi Kap Lead

Continuing to hold the limelight‘

in intramural basketball, the fra-
ternity league will bounce back
into action tomorrow night when
12 of the 13 houses battle on the
University’s ﬂoors.

Endeavoring to keep their record
spotless, the Sammies will meet the
Kappa Sigma ﬁve on the Trees
Gym court. Led by Morris Mayer,
high scorer for the Sammies, they
have rolled over all opposition in
their previous games with ease.
With little Mel Frank and Harry
Abromowitz helping Mayer, the
Neville street ﬁve are a big threat
to the Phi Kaps, this year’s de-
fending champs.

Another highspot in the eve-
ning’s play should be the game be-
tween the Delts and SAE ﬁve. The
Delts are also among the unde-
feated quintets, and must be reck-
oned with when possible champion-
ships are discussed. They are led
by Red Krunkleton, and should beat
the SAE ﬁve, who have had only a
fair season thus far.

The contest between the quintets
representing the Phi Gams and
Theta Chi should also be one of the
better games of the evening. If
Edgar Jones and Bill Fitchko play
for the Theta Chi five, the Phi
Gams will be in for a hotter eve-

ﬁning than they expect. ‘ _
Due to the expert playing Wally

Renton and Ed Rose, a newcomer
to Pitt this year, Lamba Chi Alpha
has been the surprise of the league
during the past couple of weeks.
Rated as only a probable “also ran”
team this year, the Lambda Chi ﬁve

. has looked impressive in all of their

p1eviou_s_ encounters. Rose has been
their high scorer so far, and has
helpedcthem become a real threat
to the supposedly superior outﬁts.
Rounding out the ,night’s play in
the fraternity -circuit, Sigma, Chi
meets Phi Epsilon'Pi, and the Pi-
lams battle the Theta Chi outﬁt.

Phi Kappa Smears Kappa Sigs;
SAE Defeated by Phi Eps, 27-22

Last Thursday’s games were marked with thrilling, rough, contests
as all favored teams came through with victories.

What had promise of being a good contest turned into a rout as the
Phi Kaps continued undefeated by beating the Kappa Sigma ﬁve, 27-14.
With Connell and Tyberski dropping buckets from all angles, the Phi
Kaps ran up 21 points to their opponents four.

The Phi Kappa team was composed of reserves at the start of the
second-half, and they only scored four points to the Kappa Sigs’ eleven,

Room, Sat) ed by Siuiciem:
Interest, Nears Finish

Student participation in the nationality rooms project will reach a
new high when the Greek room, now in its ﬁnal stage of construction. is

dedicated, according to Mrs.
project.
“F or,” Mrs.

Ruth Crawford Mitchell,

Mitchell declared last Friday.

adviser to the

“the Greek room has

been unique in that it is the one nationality room that has had con-

secutive student leadership.”

It was through the interest of
Greek student leaders on campus
that the Greek room, once given up
 an impossible taslr, became a re-
ality, she explained.

When, in 1925, Chancellor John
G. Bowman launched his campaign
to raise funds for the construction
of the Cathedral, various nationality
groups were appealed to for aid.
Dr. Henry S.. Scribner, then head
of the classics department, spoke
before numerous Greek organiza-
tions which agreed to donate books
and money for the project, giving
rise to a committee for that purpose,
which, although unknown to its
members, was the forerunner of the
Greek room committee. Chairman
of this committee was University
senior Peter Demos, ’25.

Student Revives Idea

It was also about this time that
Dr. Bowman conceived of his idea
of “design rooms,” which idea was
the embryo of the nationality rooms
project.

Again it was a student who re-
vived the (lying Greek room idea
when, in 1930, Charles Tomazos,
’33, took over the chairmanship of
the committee and advanced num-
erous proposals for securing the
much—needed funds.

A big year for the Greek room
was 1930, for it was then that Nich-
olas Kalmer, ’29, who had gradu-
ated  year earlier, went to Athens
and interested the Greek minister
of education in providing drawings
for the room. Kalmer, who had
been on the committee for three
years prior to that time, assumed
the chairm-anship in 1934. It was
under him that the committee took
its biggest strides forward, asserts
Mrs. Mitchell..

Greek backing was put behind
the room largely through the ef-
forts of Lillian Demestichus, ’30, she
said.

Decorator Famous

From 1934 on, under the chair-
manship of Kalmer, progress has
been steady, according to records
of meetings and accounts of moneys
received, until now, when the paint-
er is decorating the interior of the
room, the ﬁnal step before the room
will be dedicated.

The room is being decorated by
Demetrius Kokotsis, famous Greek
portrait painter. Kokotsis, winner
of a large trust fund scholarship,
has traveled through, painted in,
and studied in Italy, Spain, France,
England, Belgium, Holland and Ger-
many, he explained in an interview
last Friday. Since Mr. Kokotsis
speaks no English, the interview
was in French, with Nina Sztark,
Mrs. Mitchell’s secretary, acting as
interpreter. :

Mr. Kokotsis’ work has been fa-
vorably commented upon by noted

Budget

Continued from page one _
derived from sale of supplies are
appropriated for this budget.

Construction of the Stadium re-
quires the maintenance of the ath-
letic budget, which includes cost.of
intercollegiate athletic program, in-
tramural athletics, maintenance of
the Stadium, athletic administrative
salaries, and expense for supervi-
sion of the Stadium and athletic
programs.

The chief source of income for
this budget is intercollegiate foot-
ball, and excess of receipts is ap-
plied to Stadium bond redemption
and cancellation.

C on c ernin g the construction
budget, Mr. Rupp writes, “All con-
struction work is ﬁnanced by spe-
cial gifts As additional gifts
are received for construction pur-
poses, further construction work is
done. It has been estimated that
the Cathedral of Learning is about
92 per cent completed.”

Because of ﬁscal requirements
preventing state funds from being
used for construction purposes and
terms of the athletic mortgage re-
quiring athletic income to be used
only for athletic expenses or re-
tirement of Stadium bonds, no part
of these two budgets is available for
construction.

“The fact that budget is two and
one—half times what it was 20 years
ago,” asserted Mr. Rupp, “and the
fact that the budget is balanced
are practical evidence of growth of
rising standards, and of coopera-
tion with the community. Now,
more than ever before, the Univer-
sity has established itself as a Vital
force in western Pennsylvania.”

scribers today, may be subscribed

list if they ask for a subscription.
No charge will be asked.

dents.

international ﬁgures, including Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and a for-
mer president of France.

He has won prizes at Internation-
al exhibitions at Prague in 1924,
and Paris in 1927, he explained, and
at present has eight of his pictures
on exhibition at an international
showing in Cleveland.

Although he is engaged in decor-
ating an entire room at present,
Mr. Kokotsis said that his prefer-
ence in art leaned toward portrait
work. He has done portraits of
King George II of Greece, who, he
told in.terviewers, refused to sit be-
fore any other artist. He has also
done portraits of George Metaxas,
premier of Greece, and many noted
Greek educators.
