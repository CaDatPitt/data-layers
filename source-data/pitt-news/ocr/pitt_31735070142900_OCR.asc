City and Universitycould drop some students’ charges

A deputy police chief says the city won’t punish Pitt students who can prove they got ‘caught up’ in G—2O demonstrations

The deputy city police chief said
yesterday that if Pitt students prove
they were “caught up” with protest-

against them.

Pitt students speak out about the G—2O Summit protests

011 campus.

a Pitt spokesman said the Univer-
sity wants to “treat people fairly”
but is still try to determine how to
refer students to itsjudicial Board,
which can suspend or expel stu-
dents, marking a change from its
stance yesterday.

“If we do determine that anyone
was a student and merely caught
up with the people down the
street, then we’ll move to dismiss

iﬁetty, harsh
‘Punishment’

the charges,” Donaldson said. He ‘

didn’t elaborate on how students
could prove they were “caught up”
with protesters.

 

A group of city officials —— in-
cluding Mayor Luke Ravenstahl,

County Chief Executive Dan On-
orato, Chief of Police Nate Harper
and Deputy City Police Chief Paul
Donaldson — joined for a press
conference in the mayor’s ofﬁce
at the City-County building yes-

terday afternoon. They recapped .

successes from the G-20 Summit
and answered questions about the
Oakland protests when prompted
by reporters.

Shortly after, in a reversal of its
previous stance, the University said
it might not send all Pitt students
who were arrested in Oakland

Thursday or Friday to its Judicial

Board.

Fedele said he can’t make “a
blanket statement” about which
students will be sent to thejudicial
Board, which has the power to sus-
pend or expel students.

University says not all
arrested students will
go to Judicial Board

Charges 4 1

I But he did say, “I don’t think -

being arrestedjs a violation of stu-
dent code. Being arrested does not
mean you did the crime, so simply
being arrested is not a violation of
the student code.”

Fedele added, however, that if
students are found guilty of crimes,
they’ve likely violated the Student
Code of Conduct and thus will be
sent to thejudicial Board.

Fedele said he wasn’t sure
whether the University will wait
until after the city police decide
whether to drop students’ charges
to review students’ cases.

“It’s the type of thing that will
probably be handled on an indi-
vidual basis,” he said.

Fedele said University represen-
tatives have contacted city officials
regarding their “shared desire to
ensure that students caught up in
the activities of Thursday and Fri-
day evening be treated fairly.”

He said he didn’t know which
administrators had contacted city
officials or when they had contact-
ed them.

Fedele declined to comment on
the way the police acted Thursday
and Friday.

“It would be premature to offer
our own assessment at this point,”
he said.

Ravenstahl said he thought

police responded admirably, but

that during an evaluation of the
entire G-20 event and planning,
they would also consider the use
of police force.

“We will have that evaluation
done and take a look at all the ac-
tions that took place,” Ravenstahl
said. “But as a whole, I think the
event delivered well.”

“You look at the demonstrations
that took place, I think it was 13 of
them that were peaceful, one that
got out of hand and I think that’s a
credit to the people here in Pitts-

City defends police

Police argue many people were ﬂeeing arrest, not dispersing

Charges 4 2

The mayor said that he thinks the number
of public safety ofﬁcers —- 3,078 —— who were
in the city was an appropriate number.

“There were no major injuries at all.
None, which is unprecedented for an event
of this time and I think speaks volumes to
the planning effort that went into this event,”
Ravenstahl said.

Donaldson said police gave the order
to disperse in Schenley Plaza on Thursday
because of the crowd size and the G—20 activ-
ity at Pitt. He said on Friday night that the
intent was to allow protesters to stay until
11:00 p.m. ~

“Then the order was given, but at 10:42,
conditions had deteriorated and the decision
was made to break the crowd up at that time,”
Donaldson said.

He said police were concerned that there
would be a repeat of Thursday night, when
businesses’ windows were broken along
Forbes Avenue and Craig Street.

When asked about students who might
have been trapped or felt they had no place
to disperse to, Donaldson said he “can’t un-
derstand that.”

“We didn’t see any movement on the pro-
testers to disperse until after we started [to

(‘(3/"7."’ x7;:"’/M’ /I./V ,1.”/’ tjj/V (jZ./  (7 /('7/‘.;.»H‘.:‘ /I’  :’l"A 

arrest people],” he said. “When that hap-
pened, then many of them tried to ﬂee. And
I think at that time, they were not really
dispersing — they were eluding prosecu-
tion. They were running away to get away
from there.”

Donaldson estimated 700 to 800 people
were in the area, although the Post— Gazette
and The New York Times have estimates of
400 to 500. He guessed 85 percent of indi-
viduals were able to leave the area.

Police Chief Harper said he thought the
officers were very professional. .

He said he thought they “rose to level,”
considering the number of protesters whose
“intentions wereon causing disruption in
the city.” .

One reporter asked the group whether or
not they thought that when police released
riot gas and shot rubber bullets at protesters,
the action discouraged current and prospec-
tive students from studying in Pittsburgh.

“Any thought of reaching out to Pitt stu-
dents and saying, ‘Hey, we love you‘?”’ the
reporter asked.

There was some laughter in the crowd,
and Ravenstahl laughed, as well.

“We love you,” he said to more laughter.

Editorial

Students Iosel
sense of home

rested duringG-20 Surnrnitpolice
actions, you rnightthinkthe Sum-
rnitwas not worth the hassle.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl dis-
agrees.

He said that projected revenue
increases made the G-20 a runaway
success, even consideringthe behavior
of the police and some demonstra-
tors. World leaders apparently feel
proud about the Summit too, point-
ing to agreements to reduce Chinese
exports and U.S. debt. Meanwhile, the
Thomas Merton Center threatened
lawsuits against the city for excessive
police force in a “military-style occu-
pation.” .

These three messages wildly di-
verge from each other, each fashioning
its own version of reality.

Students’ perspectives on the
crackdown differ as well. Students
did not ask for this Summit, though
many were excited to partake in in-
ternational diplomacy and free speech
demonstrations — infact, some pro-
fessors encouraged it. These students
were met by waves of police, soldiers
and K-9 units.

The rest is history — readers just
might get different versions of this
history, depending onthe source that
wrote it.

Some facts are indisputable. City
police have acknowledged that in-
nocent Pitt students got caught in a
mess, and deputy city police Chief
Paul Donaldson said that the city will
actively work to drop charges on those
students.This is a good start, but itwill
not erase students feeling a debilitat—
ing loss of home.

Before the initial Oakland storm,
some students lightheartedly mocked

Week’s demonstrations.

the protesters, such as those who car—
ried signs that read, “Everythingis OK”
and “Don’t protest.” They understood
the need to protect world leaders and
maintain order.

Opinions rightly changed after stu-
dents scrambled invainto escape gas
and rubber bullets. In the aftermath,
it is not even physical injury that trau-
matized students — many tell their
warstories with a certain pride. More
damaging is the students’ feeling that
they are unsafe in their own homes,
on their own patios and on their own
campus.

This destroys community and col-
lege pride. Unfortunately, it also un-
dermines trustinthe police force. The
operation of a police body depends on
both force and trust. By using undue
force, police oflicers hurt the trust that
residents place in them. This is more
destructivethanthe $50,000 indarn-
ages done to the city by miscreants.

The University has not released
an official statement regardingpolice
conduct, though that silence might
have been better than Ravenstahl’s
statement. At the mayor’s Monday
press conference, areporter askedhim
if the city plans outreach to current
and prospective students to allay lin-
geringfears, to say, “We still love you.”
Ravenstahl smiled as he ﬂippantly re-
plied, “We still love you.” That was all
he offered. _

With an estimated $35 million in
economic stimulus and $100 million
in media exposure, theﬂ-20 Summit
might have been apayday for the city,
but the events surrounding it stole
somethingfrom students. And neither
increased revenue nor city reputation
are the kind of currency that can buy
our love back.

Letters to the editor

To the Editor:

I’m sure The Pitt News has all available information on the speciﬁc events that occurred
Thursday and Friday evenings on Pitt’s campus. The purpose of this letter is to urge re-
sponsible reporting. '_

Testimonies of the students assaulted must be taken seriously. The reports of the students
arrested must be trusted — even when in conﬂict with police reports. The voices of the
students arrested and assaulted must be heard through their own newspaper. The article
on the police action must be written very carefully, with the strongest regard to facts. The
Pitt News must not take into account other interests besides the students’ voices.

The Pitt News must look into the obvious investigative avenues. The response by the
paper will be very telling of the entire event. Will the students stand by their university’s

_ paper if it doesn’t investigate and help in holding accountable those responsible for the

ﬂagrant abuse of their student body and campus?

Unassuming students walked into the scene of riot police marching in a two-deep line
down Forbes Avenue. The vast majorityof those on Pitt’s campus were Pitt students. Po-
lice continued to use the same riot control mechanisms that they used against a group of
radical protesters in Lawrenceville on Thursday. - V g

The Pitt News is in the best ‘position to investigate potentially illegal actions by the Pitts-
burgh police department on Pitt’s campus. The Pitt News has the only necessary audience
and tools to bring justice to our students -— many of whom were arrested and assaulted.

The students arrested must not face academic penalties, no matter their supposed

' actions. . -

It’s time for the excellent journalists at the Pitt News to get to work. ,, ,

Thank you,
Tyler Custer
School of Arts & Sciences

To the officers of the law present in Pittsburgh:

Thanks for being here. With the possibility of large violent actions because of the G-20
Summit, I’m glad you were around to stop people from causing needless or excessive dam-
age to the city and to protect the world leaders.

It should be noted, however, that Friday’s activities should in no way have been con-
sidered a reaction to the G—20. Both sides acted poorly, but you (should) know better.
You have training, you have people to think about possible responses and you are not a
decentralized mob.

I want an apology. - .

I want a public apology from the riot forces —— to Pitt, and speciﬁcally to the students
whose lives you made miserable —- stating that you overreacted to the actual threat of
protesters and activities in the Oakland area. Stating that you unnecessarily used exces-
sive crowd control on groups who were there simply to observe, and you failed to consider
curious college studentsin your planning.

And stating that you failed in your duty to keep people safe and their homes secure —- to
the point where students were afraid of law enforcement, and their homes were neither
secure, comfortable or safe places.

You were correct in breaking up groups that were damaging property and in keeping
world leaderssafe. But you were wrong here,‘ and you need to admit that to all of those
you wronged (as should, perhaps, some of the arrested students). Such actions, whether
permitted by codes or laws or procedures, can be and often are simply wrong. We all owe

it to everyone to think and apologize when what we did was out of line.

Sincerely, _

I can do that because the United

But the second night of Oaldand
protests was nothing more than an
eradication of all life.

« As it all happened, Iasked myself,

‘ “Where did my college go? Where is
my Oakland?” I didn’t recognize this

martial law. .

I couldn’twalkto my South Oak-

would have arrested me or worse.
Even if I could, for the ﬁrst time
in my life, I was scared of my own
government. .

During the protests, a cold terror
in the back of my mind told me to
ﬂee to the nearest shelter I could
ﬁnd.

When I calledthem, both the city
and Pitt police told me I just had to

wait it out, and if I had a problem, I
could ﬁle a grievance.

to spread, it wasn’t through throw-

subtle fact that with their stutter

‘crime and Punishment ’ a no vel performance

Intrigued with the character of Raskolnikov, Joel Ripka reconsiders month—long hiatus and jumps into role

Bethie Girmai
For The Pitt News

Sometimes for actors, slipping
into character isn’t as comfort-
able or easy as putting on a favor-
ite pair of jeans. In fact, it often
requires an actor to assume a
whole new personality.

In Pittsburgh Irish 8: Classical
Theatre’s newest performance,
“Crime and Punishment,” that is
exactly whatjoel Ripka had to do
to play the devious and murder-
ous Raskolnikov.

“I learned early on never to
judge my character,” Ripka said.
“We all have a saint and sinner
inside depending on our be-
havior and the actions we take.
The moment we ﬁnd an answer
to this question, we lose all the
drama.”

“Crime and Punishment” is
based on Fyodor Dostoevsky’s
Russian novel, written in the mid-
1860s. The novel tells the story
of Raskolnikov, sometimes called
Rodion, as he plans to commit
two aimless murders and follows
his psychological struggle as he
ﬁgures out what to do in the af-
termath of his crimes.

Ripka stands by his conflicted
character. He believes there’s a
bumbling likeability about him.
Although he killed two people,

Ripka claims that Rodion isn’t a
malicious man. Misguided and
naive maybe, but not malicious.

In fact, it was Rodion’s char-
acter that pulled Ripka into the
play.

Ripka never expected to segue
into another show so quickly. He
planned to take a month—long
break before he auditioned for
another show, having just ﬁn-
ished another production.

“I got an e—mail from Andrew,
a director I had worked with be-
fore, asking me to reconsider not

auditioning for the show. I had . .

just ﬁnished “Harry’s Friendly
Service” at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater and planned to take a
month of .” _

However, Ripka complied with
the director’s request and read a
copy of the script. He ending up
falling in love with the charac-
ter and felt compelled to tell his
story. He auditioned for the role
not long after.

Although staying true to both
the theatric adaptation and the
original novel may seem chal-
lenging to many, Ripka has not
found it to be difficult.

“We are doing this play and
not the novel,” he said. “Our only
job is this play, to serve the play-
wright. It’s more about the theat-
rical experience of the play.”

Ripka explained that when

acting in an adaptation, espe-
cially one that has several trans-
lations, worrying about satisfy-

ing all of its forms gets to be too

When he was initially cast in

“Crime and Punishment,” Ripka
read the novel to better under-
stand and connect with Rodion.

Ballyhoo! finds inspiration in Green Day, East Coast life

Lukas Truckenbrod
Sta_ﬂ"Writer

" Ska-punk rock inﬁised with reggae.

Sublime? No. Ballyhoo!

The Aberdeen, Md., rock outﬁt
frowns at the many links to the Long
Beach punk band, citing other bands
like Reel Big Fish, Bob Marley and
Green Day as additional inﬂuences.

“Sublime did their thing, and
now we’re doing ours,” lead singer,
guitarist and primary lyricist Howi
Spangler said.

Perhaps band members’ East
Coast upbringing makes this a sepa-
rate enterprise. All band members
hail from Maryland.

The band formed when Spangler
and his brother began high. school.
Spangler cited Green Day as his fa-
vorite band of those adolescentyears,
maintaining them as his all—time go-
to band.

Ballyhoo! released its sophomore
album, Cheersl, in May, following its
2008 release, Do It for the Money,
which the band said put it “on the
map.”

Spangler said this most recent ~

album is a step forward as far as ma-
turity is concerned, and he was a bit
nervous about alienating the band’s
core fans who enjoy tailgating at Bal-
lyhoo! shows.

“We love our fans,” Spangler said.
“They’re really who we’re doing this

for.

Embarking on a 70—plus show » -

bogged down — the band members
hang out, throws a few back with its
fans and passes out its CDs, most of
the time for free.

Donald Campbell

Some people continually work under the
assumption that the major computer com-

into one little mold. e

Windows machines are dominant but
unreliable. Apple machines are expensive
but stable, and Linuxmachines are both
stable-and inexpensive —- but only if you
know how to use them properly. _

“The great thing is, Syracuse is
a great blocking team,” Rens said.
“They have Sarah Morton, who’s lead-
ing the conference in blocks per set
(1.61). Meagan really out-played her,
and as a team, we out-blocked them

signiﬁcantly.”

Dooley helped the Panthers drop

preparation onblocking. We worked
on it quite a bit last week, and it was
great to see it pay off for us.”

Rens said the work in practice
has been going on all year, but some
players are now getting the chance
to use their fundamentals in game
situations.

“It’s starting to come together
more because some players — like
Harper, Stadelman and Allyson Hod-
nik — have a lot more match experiaq
ence now under their belts,” he said.
“It becomes alot easier forthem with
the match experience to apply things
on the court, and that’s exactly what
happened over the weekend.”

Even Hoclnik, who is 5 feet7 inches
tall, ﬁnished with three blocks against
Marquette.

Rens said she works hard on tim-
ing and setting the block in practice
and often has to play against oppo-
nents standing at 6 feet or more.

That effort could push the Pans:
thers through the tough stretch of
the upcoming schedule.

The Panthers are surely disap-
pointed to leave the Fitzgerald Field

Goalkeeper Kephart sets school shutout record

Pitt men’s soccer team falls to DePaul and South Florida while women play fourth overtime game this season

Lauren Kirschman
Staff Writer

Pitt: 0 '
DePaul: 1

The Pitt men’s soccer head
coach, Joe Luxbacher, said his team
created plenty of opportunities to
score this season.

It’s capitalizing on those oppor-
tunities that present a problem.

Pitt’s scoring woes continued

against DePaul (5-3 overall, 2-1.-0

Big East) on Friday night when the
Panthers (1-8, 0-4-0) dropped a
1-0 decision to the Blue Demons
at Founders Field.

“If you are not creating any
scoring chances, you have real
issues,” Luxbacher said. “We’re
creating chances. Both games
this weekend, we had some good
chances — we just couldn’t ﬁnish
them.” ‘

Luxbacher said the Panthers
produced as many, if not more,

good scoring opportunities as the
Blue Demons.

But it was DePaul’s Steffen
Vroom who took advantage of
a scoring chance with a game-
winning header goal in the 45th
minute.

It was a tough goal for Lux-
bacher and his team.

“Our guys are battling, and
we’ve been ﬁghting a lot of really
good teams. But at the end of the
day, they are all losses, and you

have your back against the wall,”
he said. ,

The Panthers carne out strong
in the ﬁrstperiod, out-shooting
DePaul 7.-4 before the break.

However, the Blue Demons out-
shot the Panthers 8-4 in the second
period, ﬁnishing with a 12-11 shot
advantage.

Luxbacher said that despite fo-
cusing on ﬁnishing and shooting
in practices, the Panthers haven’t
made the plays in games. ~

“Our primary effort in recruit-
ing now is towards goal scorers —
guys who have the talent to score
and are used to scoring,” Luxbach-

. er said. “You can be in every game

if you have a couple of guys who“
can ﬁnish off every play.”

Pitt drops the ball

Not even experienced players could ward off the lWolfpack

  
   

Deseree Kuzel I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Mick Williams has been a staple of a Panthers defense that has come under sc_rutiny lately.

Kelly Flanigan
For The Pitt‘ News

With less than three minutes left in the fourth
quarter, Pitt linebacker Max Gruder recov-
ered a fumble on NC State’s 8—yard line.

Bill Stull took the ﬁeld with the offense,
looking to tie the game.

On ﬁrst down, freshman running back
Dion Lewis ran for a short gain.

A play later, Stull and Dorin Dickerson
connected on a pass — for a loss.

On third down, Dickerson tried to catch
a lofty pass in the end zone.

With aﬁnal chance to score a touchdown,
Stull dropped back and overthrewjonathan
Baldwin, who was not within 10 feet of the
pass. . L
The game left Pitt fans disappointed and
shocked — the Panthers had just lost 38-
31.

During these painstaking last minutes,
fans got scarring images of N C State Wolfpack
quarterback Russell Wilson shredding defen-
sive coordinator Phil Bennett’s’ secondary
with cross routes.

He looked like an all-star as he racked up
322 passing yards and threw four touchdown
passes.

The Panther defense seemed unable to
slow the explosive offense.

NC State became the second team this sea-
son to rack up more than 500 yards against
Pitt — Buffalo’s offense put up 500 yards
on Sept. 12. ‘

Fans must question the leadership on this
team and look for a leader to carry the Pan-

thers this season. _

Lewis picked up where LeSean McCoy
left off, carrying for 95 yards and two touch-
downs. ’

But when NC State’s defense shut down the
running game in the second half, Pitt needed

. another player to step up.

It’s disappointing that players such as
Baldwin, Oderick Turner, Nate Byham and
Cedric» McGee were not called upon more
frequently.

With so many experienced playmakers, it
is frustrating not to be able to convert when
the game is on the line. ,

As conference play approaches, the Pan-
thers need a player who wants to make a dif-
ference.

Kick returner Cam Saddler showed
promise as he returned the opening Wolf-
pack kickoff for 50 yards and scored his ﬁrst
touchdown of the season off of a screen pass
from Stull.

On defense, lineman Mick Williams left
everything he had at Carter-Finley Stadium
on Saturday afternoon. ‘

He seemed to be everywhere on the ﬁeld l

at once —— pile—driving the NC State running A
back, forcefully tackling on NC State’s 1—yard.
line for a near safety, causing _a fumble and
hurrying several passes. '
Williams, a senior, was Pitt’s defensive
all-star and MVP in Saturday’s game.
Traveling to Kentucky on Friday night to
face the Louisville Cardinals requires‘ Pan-
thers to put this painful loss behind them as
they enter Big East Conference play. i __
Fans said they hope the Panthers will once
again.be contenders for the Big East title. V T

Women tie in double overtime

Soccer 4 11

third-ranked South Florida (6-1-1, 2-1-1), the
Panthers dropped their eighth consecutive
game 2-1 at Founders Field on Sunday.

“They got a ‘point off a penalty kick and
one off a restart, a corner kick,”, Luxbacher
said. “They had more shots. But in terms of
good chances, we ‘had just as many as they
did. But we didn’t get a result.” S

The Bulls got on the board early, scoring
in the 15th minute. ‘

They increased their lead to 2-0 six min-
utes into the second half when Jorge Mora

. capitalized on a penalty kick.

Pitt’sJustin Boehm put the Panthers on

the board late in the game, but his goal in ~

the 85th minute was too late for a come-
back.  ,_ 1‘  .1  __ ,_ 1, _
South Florida out-shot-Pittl8—_2 in the ﬁrst
half and111-8 in the-vsecond half.
But Luxbacher said the Panthers created
plenty of scoring chances despite the shot

discrepancy.

 

_ Pitt will attempt to halt its losing streak I

in a home match against Providence on Sat-
urday. '

Pitt: 0
Marquette; O
‘ Double overtime

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart set the
school record for season and career shut-
outs when the Pitt women’s soccer team
played to a scoreless tie with Marquette at
Valley Fields in Milwaukee on Sunday.

Kephart, ajunior, now has six shutouts

....this season and 11 for her career. She accu-

mulated a career-high 11 saves in the match
and leads the Big East with 56 this season.-
Head coach Sue—Moy Chin said the back-
ﬁeld of Kat Weiler, Maura Caslin, Rebecca
Fraser and Abby Baldys deserved some of
the recognition for Kephart’s success.‘
__ “Morie played great today,” Chin said.
“She made some really nice saves for us and
controlled the area very well, but the whole

' backline played tremendous in front of her.

You have ‘to give credit to them, as well.”
It was the second consecutive game in

which the Panthers (5-2-3, 0-0-3) played ‘

into double overtime and yielded the same
result.

Kephart was in goal when South Florida
came to Pitt on Friday. .

Four of Pitt’s last ﬁve games have
stretched into at least one extra period.

Despite the excess playing time, Chin
said her team didn’t show signs of fatigue.

“We had good legs. We didn’t look tired
in_the overtime,” Chin said. “We’re in ev-
ery game. I don’t know if there’s a mental
toll, but we’re strong physically. So I think
we’re OK.”

The shot differential didn’t indicate the
ﬁnal score, though. T

The Golden Eagles (7-3-1, 1-1-1) out-shot

    

i the Panthers 26-4 for the game, including

6-1 in the overtimes.

Chin said the team needs to focus on get-
ting the midﬁelders and forwards in sync
again before the next game.

"-‘We have to work on possession, on re-
ally getting the ball and connecting again,”
Chin said.

The Panthers return to the ﬁeld on Friday

when they take on DePaul at home.

“When you’re on the road, you have to shut
out all distractions,” Rens said. “I think that
we can learn from our early, difficult, out-of-
conference road schedule. Itwas tough, but we

learned stuff from that. We have to be on top of‘

things as far as preparation —— academically
and mentally.”

It will be a difficult test for Pitt, which will
play two teams picked to ﬁnish ahead of it in
the preseason ballot.
