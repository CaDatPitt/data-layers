News oﬁ‘e£s 7°/[ll.71n’ Aid
To Exam-Cram Victims

By Georgia Shuset
This story is not for 3-point students.
Nor is it for those sensible individuals, who, at the sound of the
gong, tuck their books under their arms, rush for the nearest exit, and
go home or to the library to bury their intelligent heads in their un-

derlined texts.

Rather is it for the majority. \
For those who are convinced that

cramming is a permanent institu-
tion.

Here’s how:

You usually make out an impres-
sive looking work schedule. Say
two hours per exam. Say three.
Who cares?

Change into pajamas and a robe
(This isn’t advised if you’re study-
ing in the library). Comfort is a
prime requisite for concentration
(But indecency isn’t). ,

Gather together the necessary
number of pencils, scratch pads, ap-
ples, cigarettes, candy bars, chewing
gum, pillows, and soft drinks.
(This recipe was given by alumna
Gertie Lieblich, who dished out
cramming advice last year around
this time.)

Then spendran houror so copy-
ing over the notes you took in pen-
cil. By this time your eyes are
beginning to water and your toes
are getting cold, and you wanna
go to bed.

But you carry on. And your per-
severance is rewarded.

Sooner or later you’re bound to
come to a part that’s interesting.

Then follows a brief period in
which you regret not having studied
before. “This stuff is good!” you
exclaim. Maybe.

After an hour of relaxation, you
go back to your books, you little
devil, you. Leaﬁng through your
notes, you ﬁnd some very interest-
ing doodles, assorted poems, and
sundry humorous observations.
After a brief review of this pano-
rama of your extra-curricular ac-
tivities, you kick off your bedroom
slippers and crawl into bed.

There’s always tomorrow.

The wheel of death rolled over the campus Monday night and when it

To the student aides at the Foster Memorial, James C. Murray was

the 65-year-old man would take a
rest and then go to his seat. ‘

Monday night, Pittsburgh civic
and education groups were honor-
ing Stephen Collins Foster in the
hall named after him. .

Mr. Murray came into the audi-
torium and took his seat. He be-
gan to cough and called a student
aide, telling him that he was having
a heart attack and must have some
whiskey.

The aide ran to the bar of a
nearby hotel and demanded a small
bottle of whiskey. Refused there,
he called for the manager and suc-
ceeded, ﬁnally, in getting what he
had come for. Attempting, then,
to reach a doctor, he was beset by
a barrage of questions. Dr. W. P.
Burleigh was summoned from the
audience and, ﬁnding Mr. Murray
in the lobby of the downstairs re-
ception room to which he had been
removed, pronounced him dead.

Mr. Murray lived at 310 Maple

First of Six Chinese ‘Scholar’
Trees Blooms on Pitt Campus

By Julia. Waida

All colleges have their scholars,
but the University also has its
scholar trees. On campus are lo-
cated six sophora japonicas, com-
monly known as Chinese scholar
trees, which have been called “the
most valuable horticultural gift of
Asia to this continent.”

In keeping with its name, the
tree matures slowly and does not
ﬂower until it is 30 years old. The
only one on campus to bloom, as
yet, has been the tree between Fos-
ter memorial and the walk lead-
ing from Bigelow boulevard.

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, professor and
head of the biology department, and
Gus Bentz, University landscapist,
collaborate in selecting campus
plants and decide only after mak-
ing a study of the plants in ques-
tion.

This particular variety, which is

a native of China and Korea, has
Pittsburgh for its northern limit of
growth. The late-appearing ﬂow-
ers are creamy—white and pea-
shaped. Its dark geen, pinnate
leaves average from six to eight
inches in length and give broad
shade which does not affect the
grass‘ growing beneath the tree.

Unlike most trees, the scholar tree
is also conspicuous during the win-
ter months because of its branches
which remain dark green.

The japonica, whose maximum
height ranges from 50 to 80 feet, is
propagated by seeds and has been
found to thrive best in localities
which have well drained, shady
loam.

In addition to the specimen which
bloomed for the ﬁrst time this fall,
ﬁve other scholar trees are located
on the Belleﬁeld and Forbes street
lawns of the Cathedral.

Minor Epidemic
Hits University
Over Past Week

Noticeable absences in almost
every class and campus organi-
zation this week have been at-
tributed to ﬂu, which is believed
to have spread to minor epidemic

proportions among the student
body over the weekend.

Both Men’s and Women’s Stu-
dent Health services were unable
to give estimates of the number of
cases because of the fact that those
students who are ill will not be
able to report back to the health
service offices for excuses until they
return to school.

A poll of fraternity houses re-
vealed that approximately 50 men
students, or about one-tenth, are
conﬁned with ﬂu. Out of 50 staff
members of the Pitt News, twelve
have been taken ill this week.
Other organizations reported sim-
ilar percentages of absences be-
cause of the minor epidemic. Stu-
dent observers who are aware of
the number of absences in groups
estimate that 10 per cent, possibly
even as high as one-fifth of the
student body, has this infectious
illness.

Faculty and staff members also.

have been taken ill. Dr. Auleene
M. Jamison, director of the Wom-
en.’s Health service, was conﬁned at
her home with the ﬂu last week.
Back in her oﬁice on Monday, Dr.
Jamison stated that although many
students are absent, she saw no
danger of an actual epidemic, but
explained, “We are sending home
people upon the slightest indica-
tion of a higher temperature, sore
throat, or cold. The number of
absentees does not represent the
actual number of ﬂu cases.”

For those who are ill Dr. Jami-‘
son advised plenty of rest and

quiet, lack of worry, warmth, and
ﬂuids. ' w

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
the Men’s Health service, who re-
ported that some students whose
temperatures have been above
normal are being sent home, also
explained there is no cause for
alarm. “It’s a means of preven-
tion,” Dr. Carlson said.

Some students had the ﬂu as
early as Christmas vacation, but
the sudden increase in the number
of ﬂu cases started only last week.

Chaplain Plans

Seminar Class

,_ A course in religious apprecia.
110115;, designed as a seminar dis-
Cusslon Of appraisillg different ways
of being religious, will be given
by Dr. William R. Farmer, Univer-
iflty Chaplain, during the second
semester, announces Dr. Stanton C,
Cr3Wf01‘d, dean of the College.

Study in the course will center
on an examination of the tempera-
merits of people ‘which inﬂuence
their way of religion and will aim
to broaden the student’s intelligent
 tolerant appreciation of all re-
ligious types.

Dr. Farmer describes the new
seminar as “not a course in the
philosophy of religion, or in the
Dsychology of religion, or in com-
parative religion. It is a discus-
sion, in the manner of a seminar,
of the different ways in which peo-
ple of different temperaments try
to relate themselves to whatever
they call God,” Dr. Farmer ex-
plains.

‘flts aim is neither scientiﬁc nor
philosophical, but practical, namely
We promotion of a spirit of toler-
ance ‘on the basis of a sympathetic
and intelligent appreciation of the
different paths by which different
kinds of people ﬁnd their way to
God,” the chaplain stated.

Class meetings of the course listed
as Orientation 71-72, are scheduled
for the fourth hour on Thursday.
One credit will be given,

Although the course is to be given
only the second semester this year,
Dean Crawford expects it to run
both semesters thereafter.

Editor, the Pitt News

. . . And
Contents Noted

Editor, the Pitt News:

I suppose it could be shown, if
it had to, that a greater percentage
of the voters in a dictatorship par-
ticipate in an election than here in
the USA. That is annoying.

It shouldn’t be. Here we shout
and kneel to democracy, yet our
voters show less interest in their
function than those of the totali-
tarian powers. In spite of the fact
that their elections are predestined.
Now this can mean any number of
things: their governments rest on
a broader and more positive basis
than ours (they are more demo-
cratic. depending on concept of
~:‘emocra.cy used). It doesn’t make
‘vuch of a difference who’s elected
here anyhow (as Stanny Baldwin
opined when Rammy MacDonald
knelt to smutch the hand of King

George). It’s safer to vote than
not to vote in Deutschland und
alles, etc.

But let’s pick the worst one for
us. That really means that the
dictatorships are more democratic
in. that they are supported by a
more vigorous consent of the gov-
erned.

My, that’s awful.
0 Get Out tl1e Vote

For England will have to stop
fighting and we’ll have to stop aid-
ing her. After all, we’re (parenthe-
tically, of course) ﬁghting to make
democracy prevail over the world.
But since Germany is the acme of
democracy, then the most palpable
method of allowing that democracy
to prevail is to let Germany win
and spread her rule.

But “we don’t want to do that.
And (presumably) we don’t want
to be hypocrites either. What to
do? I have the solution and it is
simple.

Get out the vote. It came to me
in -a ﬂask. Two ﬂasks to be exact.
And both of them came over at the
Schenley (hotel). Once when I
was asked for my voter’s registra-
tion card and again when requested
to show my draft card. That place
is rigid. And if all places were as
rigid, salaam, the difficulty is gone.
0 Get in the Voters

The age for suffrage is 21, the
‘age for imbibing is 21. Combine
ﬂ1e't‘wo, make it necessary to pre-
:sen‘t a voter’s registration card be-
fore being served. Thus to enjoy
the ardent spirit one must at least
_register and the chances are higher,
‘though not certain, that more reg-
I7istered persons than unregistered
‘will vote. Why, I can see the poll-
"ing booths o’erswelled right now.

7Don’t worry about those unfortun-

“ate who don’t indulge. They’ll be
“voting like little beavers to get
Tprohibition back. _

And by the way, since paciﬁsts
are usually non-imbibers and what
we need at present  non-pacifists,
we could turn the thing around.

Make it mandatory to produ.ce
a certiﬁcate of intoxication before
voting. Thus dissenters, religious,
conscientious. and otherwise could
be dealt with efficiently without
nasty and costly lawyers and court
trials. Anyhow there’s the plan.
The means of our salvation. The
plan that will allow us to wage
(parenthetically) war with a clear
conscience, sure of representing
the true democratic ideal; the plan
that will put a spiritual force be-
hind our efforts.

Diagnosis: Functional Disorder

(On Monday we set forth our views of Pitt student government.

We said we thought

the entire set-up should be overhauled. This is the second of a series of editorials analyzinlg the

situation. It deals with College association.)

FOR SOME TIME now we have been trying
to discover exactly what this organization called
College association does throughout the year.
We know, for instance, that it sponsors several
tea and evening dances for the beneﬁt of an un-
der-publicized student loan fund.

We know also that the president of College
association makes a speech to the incoming
freshman class during Freshman week and that
the president appoints a cabinet at the beginning
of each year.

This was all we knew about CA. So we made
it a point to examine this group more thorough-
ly. We talked to its leaders. We compared notes
with former officers. We asked for CA informa-
tion from every person we knew who was
familiar with the group.

And from this research came the following
conclusions: that throughout the year CA spon-
sors several tea and evening dances for the
beneﬁt of an under-publicized student loan fund;
that the president makes a speech to the incom-
ing freshman class during Freshman week; and
that the president appoints a cabinet the begin-
ning of each school year.

_ Yes, when you come right down to it, all
that College association officers are, are pop-
ularly elected dance chairmen-—chairmen of
dances which differ from the rest because pro-
ceeds are turned over to a loan fund.

We have no quarrel with CA as a dance-
sponsoring agency. V
g The Howdy Hop, Kick-Off, Thanksgiving
dances, all CA-managed, are reputed to be the
most ﬁnancially successful shindigs of the year.

As an organization representing the largest
undergraduate school -in the University, how-
ever, College association has never got to ﬁrst
base. In fact, it has apparently never realized
what game it is supposed to be playing.

There is no reason why College association
should be primarily a social organization, let
alone absolutely so. Granted that there is more

behind their program than the mere sponsor-

ship of dances; that their prime motive is to
reap in a lot of cash for the loan fund. Never-
theless, the CA student loan fund, like the Men’s
council fund, is woefully undernourished. Its
very existence almost has to be hush-hushed for
fear there will be a wild scramble for money
they do not have to lend.

We just don’t think that College association -

Common Sense

is quite the proper agency to sponsor a loan
fund. As in the case of Men’s council, it simply
doesn’t have a ﬁnancially broad enough pro-
gram to Supply the resources for the operation
of a successful one.

Rather than a social organization, dishing
up dances for everybody in the University, Col-
lege association should be an organization whose
program is designed exclusively for students
in the College.

There is a deﬁnite need for some student-
guided program to bridge the gap between
teacher and pupil in the College. College asso-
ciation could well do this. And make a full
time job of it. For example:

It could take steps to improve the system of

faculty advisers whom the freshman students

meet in those bewildering first-year days and
then never see again.

It could sponsor vocational guidance seminars
for the liberal arts student--the student who
has the hardest time getting a job after gradua-
tion.

It could arrange somewhat of a ‘ﬁreside chat
series acquainting students with the dean of the
College. _

It could develop forums and discussion groups
familiarizing the pre-professional students with
the requirements and the best preparations for
such schools as Dentistry, Medi'ci'ne,. Law, Ed-
ucation,‘ etc.

It could sponsor closer relationships‘ between
the students and those instructors‘ of their ma-
jor subjects, possibly through the use of pe-
riodical luncheon meetings.

We feel that adherence to such a program
would ﬁll a need more greatly recog1'Ii‘zab‘l’e‘ in
the College than dances. ,

To College association, then, we make this
recommendation: appoint a committee‘ to work
with the SFA constitutional revision committee‘
and reorganize your group; turn over to" an all-
University organization the sponsorship‘ of low-
cost dances and the management of a student.

installation of‘ a program similar to the one-‘out-V

“Don’t Curb Liberties of Labor, Says Zisliind

to curb the liberties of organized
labor. The Alabarnan paced up and
down the House floor tremulously
decrying labor’s “sabotaging” of de-
fense and demanded legislation to
stop this “madness of irresponsible
unionism.” Mr. Cox’s dolorous
protests might have sounded a note
of reasoned sincerity and of pa-
triotic purpose had it not been for
the‘Congressman’s own record of
knifing‘ any and all laws promoted
inthe interest of workers. As a
member of the House Rules com-
mittee his vote, in 1939, smothered
the Wage and Hours bill and suc-
cessfully delayed passage of the
Wagner Labor act. He has won
the unenviable dist.i.nction of being
counted as labor’s enemy number 1.

Such a demand, ordinarily, would
rank of little signiﬁcance. But the
danger now lies in the fact that our
concern for defense preparation
might tempt us to play into the
hands of labor’s enemies. And I
know of no more effective device
to break the backbone of our own
defense than by undermining the
rights of labor unionism.

In the ﬁrst place, as announced
by the defense board itself, labor
strife has been but a negligible, fac-

attributed to the unwillingness of
industry to expand, and this is the
point wherein the public should
take a vigorous hand.

in the present crisis we must
grant more and more benefits and
7;l'ights to labor. For a country to
ﬁght a war or hold its defense, the
moral.e and stamina of labor es-
tablishes the difference between
defeat and victory. Capital can be
forced to go along. We can con-
script wealth. But we dare not
arouse the disfavor of labor. It is
labor who fights the wars. It is
labor who produces the instruments
for war. It is labor who holds high
the ridgepoll of freedom in the
darkest hours of threatening ty-
rany. ,

In Britain, Ernest Bevin, (leader
of the labor movement, stands sec-
ond alone to Churchill “in cabinet
rank. Morrison, Sinclair, and Atlee
——labor’s spokesmen——take foremost
power in her leadership. The con-
servative British lords abdicated.
For Britain could not wage any:
defense without the free and all in--
clusive participation of labor.

Our labor leadership is good.
Phillip Murray and Sidney Hillman
display an unswerving patriotism

terest. But they recognize the ob-
ligation of capital to fulﬁll its du-
ties as‘ as part of organized society.
When, for instance, Henry Fordide-A
nies his workers the right to or-
ganize and resorts to strong arnr
methods and discriminatory tactics;
when the Bethlehem and Republic‘
Steel‘ companies disregard the law of
the lanrl and ﬁght unionism—labor‘
must compel these disgruntled in-
d'ustri'ali'sts to join the American’)
community.. Now, however, when:
a stoppage of work is unthinkable,
we have reached that stage where
capital’ shall recognize freer union-
ism or else face the threat of gov-
ernment. If Mr. Ford or Mr. Gird-
ler will not permit democracy in
their plants, our government will‘.
Some people seem to forget that
Franklin Roosevelt won the last
election. They think that they can
nullify this triumph of labor by
camouflaging it under the defense
crisis. But Franklin Roosevelt has
become pretty much immune to
these tricks. He‘ knows‘ that the
welfare and interest of‘ labor is

ocracy. He knows that labor is the

 The American Empire——-The

  Economic cied for Expansion

Last time the class met we dis-
cussed the American Empire and
the basic concepts for understand-

ing the transition toward imperia-

lism. The first concept glossed over
was the need for becoming totali-
tarian in a relative sort of way. The
trend was then titled Relative To-
talitarianlsm. _

But RT is not a basic cause of
fundamental economic shifts;
a result. ‘We will need to adopt it
in order to compete. It’s a sort of
political weapon—better ‘still, it’s
an economic weapon.

0 The Empire As A Need

Now the empire is an economic
need. And to satisfy this need, in
the present world order, we will
we have——--become aggressive in
what resembles more and more a
totalitarian way.

But why do we need an empire‘?
‘What economic drives make an em-
pire necessary? And "why will we
need to be aggressive at a time
when aggression means military
and naval action?

The answer is in the -general do-
mestic and foreign economic situ-
ations. ‘These two situations are
not unlinked. They dovetail beau-
tifully. They are reciprocal and
merging. If I could think of any

it’s “

more adjectives, I’d use them.
0 Expanding America

In America and since the passing
of the traditional capitalist virtues
-—land, industrial, and ﬁnancial
frontiers——the general economic
system must expand in order to
keep running. And if the economic

‘system keeps running it keeps as

stable as possible the existing so-
cial system of which it is an in-
tegral part.

The most likely at step to take
when the economic system starts
slowing down—witness 9,000,000 un-
employed-—the one step most gen-
erally taken by capitalist nations
upon reaching approximately the
same general situation in produc-
tion and distribution, is to expand
outside the national boundaries.
That is, the economic system with
its rag, tag, and bobble, expands
outside the boundaries. 7

The reason for the expansion out-
side the boundaries and for not en-
tirely readjusting the economic in-
side the nation itself is that ‘expan-
sion appears more beneﬁcial and
easier to the status quo, more proﬁt-
able to what vested interests there
are, and most practical to the poli-
ticians. (This is the second in a
series of articles.)

Flu Handicaps Phi Epsilon Pi A

In ‘Blood Battle’

Gathering steam for a ﬁnal blitz-
krieg before cramming for ﬁnals
begins, competition in the frater-
nity basketball league will become

hotter than a baker’s oven, when

twelve of the thirteen houses clash
tomorrow evening.

Featuring the evening’s contest
will be the “battle for blood” be-
tween the Pilams and the Phi Eps.
A good ﬁght is always assured when
these two arch rivals clash. The
Phi Eps will be playing with their
ace scorer, Alex Zelenski, a victim
of the flu epidemic, at home in bed.
Led by “Specs” Greenberg, the P‘
lams are the surprise quintet of the
current season.

The Phi Kaps should remain un-
defeated after their game with the
Sigma Chi ﬁve. Defending champs
this year, the Phi Kaps will fa-ce
their strongest opposition when
they run up against the Phi Gams
and Sammies later in the season.

Battling for the also-ran cham-
pionship, the ﬁves representing
PiKA and Kappa Sigma will play
on the Stadium ﬂoor at 8 o’clock.
Neither of these teams has been
able to do much during the present
campaign against the leading teams.
However, battling each other, they
may provide the best game of the
night.

Although the Phi Delts have yet
to win a game this year, they may
surprise the Delta Tau Delta ﬁve,

period wore them down.

The Phi Gams should have no
trouble with the Lambda Chi quin-
tet as they warm up for their com-
ing game with the other leaders
of the league, the Sammies and

The last game of the evening
will be another tilt in which the
teams are only playing out the
schedule. The teams from the SAE
and Theta Chi houses will be the
attraction in this game.

Tonight, the engineers and inde-
pendents will endeavor to ﬁnally
get going, as their respective sched-
ules are still full because of for-
feits and double forfeits.

Only one out of the six basketball
games scheduled for Thursday was
played and this was won. by the
Orchids, who defeated the Irish,
46-7.

The Orchids starring footballers
Dutton and Fife, steamrollered their
opponents under a barrage of early
baskets and led at half-time, 25-1.

Continuing on at the beginning
of the second half the Orchids ran
up 20 more points to their rivals’
six, which made the ﬁnal score,
46-7; ‘ ~ ‘ 1

~ Fife and Williams l.ed the Orchids
with 14 and 13 points respectively,
while Martin and McG-eary led the
Irishmen with a goal and a foul for
three apiece.

In volleyball the fare was no bet-

ing played. In the lone game the
Phi Gams, with such stalwarts as
Bitner, Thurbon, and Updegraﬁ in
their lineup, defeated the Phi Delts,
15-13, 8-15, 15-8.

F rosh Blue Team

In an intersquad preliminary to
the ‘varsity game last Saturday
night, coach Howard Waite’s fresh-
man Cagers provided the early
comers with a few thrills as a
strong White outﬁt downed a ﬁght-
ing Blue team, 29-28.

Steve Zernick and Walt Jones
carried the brunt of the White at-
tack, but it remained for little
Sammy Barfeld, ﬁve foot forward,
to pull the game out of the ﬁre with
a ﬁeld goal in the last ten seconds.
Art Lalvlonaca and Chuck Shore
sparked the Blue's offensive, with
Lloyd Carlson standing out on de-

the

of the season.

Doc Carlson ’s boys will probably go into the Tech battle with-

out the services of Sam Milane-
vich, rugged defensive ace, who
suffered a bruised leg in last Sat-
urday’s Penn State skirmish. Big
Sam crashed into the wall in the
last minute of the State game and
had to be helped off the ﬂoor, but
he’s up and around again and ex-
pects to be back in the lineup after
a short rest.

Also-rans in eight straight starts
this year, Max Hannum’s .Tartans
have little more than a: prayer
and the press clippings of .the time
a Tech team parlayed a prayer and
a couple of fair basketball players
into a drought-ending triumph over
the Panthers. ‘ - .

Carrying Tech hopes tonight will
be blond, thin star shooter Wally
Patton, footballer Husky Holets,
baseball pitching ace Herm Hen-
nessey, veteran Red Burch, and
sophomore ﬁghter Dave Brinn.
Patton, Hennessey, and Brinn are

The team that ended Pitt’s string

of successes over the Scots was ~

sparked by two former Allderdice
stars, Buzzy Greenberg and Billy
Miller. And the last Tech team to
beat Pitt before that had been
coached by John Irwin, now of
Allderdice. So Tech has tradition
working for them.

But they’ll need more than tra-
dition to stop the Panthers. Com-
ing back strong after a disappoint-
ing 41-36 loss to Westminster, the
Carlson coached passers rushed
Penn State all over the court to
record a convincing 36-27 Victory.
Senior Five Clicks

With their all-senior starting ﬁve
clicking on a good short passing
game from the start, the Panthers
jumped off to a 10-6 ﬁrst quarter
lead and were never headed.

Larry Paffrath’s neat pitch shots,
and‘ "Eddie Straloski’s ﬁght and
smart leadership paced the Pittites,
while Penn State captain Johnny
Barr and his mates seemed to
crack under the drive of the Panth-
ers and their heckling schoolmates
in the stands.

Positively . . .

there will be a Pitt-Michigan swim-
ming meet at the PAA pool tonight
at 8:15 o’clock. The Wolverines,
now paced by dash star Gus Shari-
met, have held the Big Ten and na-
tional swimming titles since 1933.

Sports Staﬁ Speaks

Early last week

lay Jerry Ripp

the sports pages of the local papers carried

a small item which announced the drafting by the United States
army of one Eugene Stack, a rookie pitcher for the Cliicago ‘White~

sox.
coznspiciioiis rookie, but

No great hulabaloo was made about the drafting of this in-
Just imagine the great fuss which would

have been made if a. top ﬂight star such as Bob Feller, Hank Green-

berg, or Hugh Mulcahy had been
the draftee.

When the draft law went into
effect the big league moguls all
gave out statements that they would
cooperate fully with the govern-
ment, that they would not seek
any special favoritism, and so forth.
They all felt pretty secure because
most of the big league aces are
married and have families to sup-
port. Yet they overlooked the fact
that some of the better players are
unmarried and have no depend-
ents to rely on to claim exemption
from the draft law. A :
ODependent? Hardly!

Also they overlooked the‘ fact
that if the draft board wished to,
they could become very technical
and make even the married stars
report for military training. This
could easily be done. They could
point out that last year Joe DiMag-
gio made some $30,000 and that
his talented and beautiful Wife,
Dorothy Arnold, could return to
the stage or cinema if she couldn’t
get along on that sum for a year.

This column is not advocating
complete exemption from the draft
for these or any other persons.
Every athlete must do his part
in preparing America for the com-
ing showdown just as the average
citizen, not in the public limelight,
must. But some special plan must
be evolved for these men who pro-
vide our citizenry with so much en-
tertainment and relaxation during
the summer months.

Perhaps the draft board would
consider letting the ball players
take their training during the off
season. They would be available
from October through February, a
total of ﬁve months. Their training

 

could be divided into two such ﬁve
month periods. In this way there
would be no infringement on the
big leagues, schedule and no team
would lose a valuable cog.
owhere, Indeed?

The club owners could also be-
come technical if they wished, and
claim that they are the depend-
ents of the various players. They
would be technically, if not legally,
right. Where would the Cleveland
Indians have been last season with-
out Bob Feller, and where would
the Detroit Tigers have ﬁnished in
the American League race if they
hadn’t had the potent bat of Hank
Greenberg?

That the draft has frightened
some of the club owners is very
apparent. The ﬁnancially crippled
Phillies could have come out of the
red with the sale of Hugh Mulchay,
their star pitcher, to one of the
richer clubs. However, not one of
the owners wanted to risk spending
$50,000 and several players for a
bachelor pitcher, who might be
called to the service at any time.
ospecial Concessions

Competitive sports in America
are as much a part of our dem-
ocracy as anything else. We must
give the general public some form
of diversion. The fact that several
millions of dollars are spent an-
nually by the sports loving public
shows that they are satisﬁed with
the American forms of diversion.

The draft board must make
special concessions for the ball
clubs and see to it that nothing hap-
pens to disrupt their eﬁorts to help
keep the American way of living
alive.

Passage of Bill

To Aid Britain

Town Meeting Hears

Talk on FDR’s Plans

By Sidney Grossman

Passage of the “lend-lease”
bill which would give President
Roosevelt power to aid embattled
democracies was foreseen by Dr.
Elmer D. Graper, professor and
head of the political science de-
partment, speaking before the Pitt
Town meeting Monday.

“The House will probably ap-
prove the bill in short order,” Dr.
Graper said. “In the Senate it is
a different story. There are enough
senators who disapprove of the
bill, or the President’s policies, to
prevent a limit being placed on
debate. But they will ﬁnd that
public opinion is in back of the
measure and my guess is that it
will be passed.”

FDR Limit Likely

Before ﬁnal passage of the bill
at least two changes will probably
be made, stated Dr. Graper. The
Senate will likely place a one-or
two-year limit on the powers grant-
ed the President, and Congress will
require the President to report at
intervals on progress under the bill.
Thus Congress will act as adminis-
trative supervisor, on the order of
the House of Commons, he said.

“The President has been given
sweeping powers in this bill,” Dr‘
Graper commented. “It makes all
previous delegations of power look
like nothing.”

It is evident, he said, that the
President thinks time is so import-
ant that he has asked for these
new powers.

Graper Likes Policy

“There are many people who
don’t like the bill, but who are con-
vinced that England must be aided
at once, and so will favor it,” stated
Dr. Graper. “It is the ultimate of
folly to expect a large legislative
body to administer anything. A
long debate of policy will spoil the
opportunity to use the measures.”

Discussing the administration’s
policy of “aid short of war,” Dr.
Graper said that he was in com-
plete agreement with that policy.

“If England falls we would be
faced with an organized continent,”
he declared. “Even if the dictators
said they would not interfere with
us, we would still feel that the
danger was so great that we would
prepare a great military machine.”
Hitler Victory Dangerous

Dr. Graper emphasized this fact
during the question and answer
period that followed his talk. A
victory by the dictators, he said,
would mean that we would eventu-
ally have to engage in conﬂict with
them.

In reply to a question, Dr. Graper
disclosed that the “lend-lease” bill
would take precedence over the
Johnson neutrality act which for-
bids the government from extend-
ing loans to nations which owe us
money.

He pointed out, too, that it is
possible that the President could
act, without ‘a bill being passed. It
would be much like the destroyer
transaction of a short time ago,
where the attorney—general issued
a decision that the deal was with-
in the President’s power.

People Endorse FDR Policy

Further discussing administra-
tion policy, Dr. Graper said, “The
administration, I think, hopes to
keep America out of war.”

Dr. Graper stated that the Roose-
velt foreign policy represented the
policy of the majority of the Amer-
ican people and he pointed to the
election result as proof.

According to the Gallup poll, the
Roosevelt majority varied with ac-
tivities abroad, he said. When con-
ditions abroad looked bad for the
British, the Roosevelt percentage
rose and, conversely, when the Brit-
ish made gains the percentage for
Roosevelt went down.

Aldo Icardi, C43, presided at the
meeting.

Coilegiate \Vasl|ing‘t.on Letter . . .
Legiorfs 18-‘?! Draft Law
Amendment Causes Stir
In Washington Circles

By Intercollegiate Vlfashington Press
WASHINGTON, Jan.

15-The American Legion proposal to limit

compulsory military service to young men between 18 and 21—currently
going the rounds of Capitol Hill in search of support——is belatedly forc-
ing an out and out decision on the real purpose of the selective service law.

Legion forces are mobilizing in a
concerted effort to secure decisive
backing for the bill.

The “Legion Amendment” would
rewrite entirely the Selective Serv-
ice act, substituting the age limits
18 to 21 in place of the existing 21
and 36 limits. Draft registrants
now 21, presumably, would escape
the possibility of military service.

The central problem touched off
by the Legion proposal arises from
a divergence of opinion concerning
the actual defense needs of the na-
tion. The existing conscription
]aw——based on actual war-time
plans of the War Department——
seeks to produce a huge army in the
shortest time possible. Ostensibly,
the Legion plan is to build up a
“permanent” stock of trained men
to be subject to call whenever a
crisis should develop-—in six months
or in ten years.

Considerable impetus for the sub-
stitute legislation has originated in
the belated realization that either
the sending of another AEF to Eu-
rope or the mobilization of a large
home defense force to check a pos-
sible invasion become extremely re-
mote. Hence, the support for a
long-time plan for building up a
reserve of men trained for one year
between 18 and 21 in basic military
tactics.

American Legion spokesmen de-
clare that if an invasion of conti-
nental U. S. should actually be un-
dertaken, not 1,000,000 but much
closer to 10,000,000 men would be
required to protect our extensive
coastline. L

Support for the Legion proposal
is‘ on the increase in Washington.
However, it has remained scatter-
ed, leading informed observers to
predict that, although some change
in the existing legislation is an
acute possibility, such a drastic step
as that envisioned in the American
Legion amendment is unlikely.

Considerable signiﬁcance may be
attached to the fact that both the
War department and selective serv-
ice officials have withheld informal
endorsement of the 18 to 21 age
limits for military service.

the Commons Room or during a
lecture hour. There were many
scratchings-out; the spelling was
D901‘ and sentences ran together
with no more punctuation than an
occasional comma.

To his classmates he wrote:: “I
desire to make the next generation
of healers the best. I . . . spent
too much time worrying . . and
thinking that hard work and un-
socialability would permeate a bet-
ter attitude for study.

“This state if carried to a patient
would have lead to no good for our
purpose . . . So for the betterment
of this cause I now remove one
small obstacle.”

To his parents and close friends
he wrote the following:

You have both sacriﬁced and
saved for me to the extent you
have made yourselves less socia-
ble. I wish now that you can get
out and do something. To put it
sla.ngly—“Don’t be so tight.” If
however you have gone to the
place where you no longer enjoy
fellow men you must adjust your-
selves by becoming more interest-
ed in other (peoples welfare. Don’t
be so self centered. Become a
helper not a complainer. As a les-
son for being so helpful I hope my
money rots in the bank.

What to do with my stuff—if
you have no better ideas please
then give the fruits of my work to
(name deleted by editor for
ethical reasons) which will include
—my binacular miscroscope and all
my books concerning the study of
medicine. He would be greatly
aided ﬁnancially if you so desire.
If you feel you might want to make
his life less of a handicap and try
to improve our future doctors then
put him through med. school. Pay-
ing his tuition only. He must work

for books and other money but this
large item is his biggest drawback.
Good luck to you, (name), hope
you get in this fall. Make good
for my sake, please! Take care of‘
(name) and I hope the both of you
a very happy life.

A student who spoke to Berkey
last Thursday night at a Collem-
bolae meeting found no indication
that the boy was under strain. It
was known, however, that Berkey
was subject to frequent fainting
spells. One of his professors, Dr.
Davenport Hooker, spoke of him‘*as
being of ﬁne character, quiet and
industries, and very popular with
students and faculty, although not
possessed of a domineering per-
sonality.

A friend, upon reading the notes,
declared that they did not resem-
ble so much Berkey’s manner of
speech as they did that of his fa-
ther. Berkey’s mother was a strict
vegetarian and fellow students ob-
served that while they ate the home
made lunche-s peculiar to the (Med
school, Berkey often satisfied him-
self with a thin leaf of lettuce be-
tween two slices of ‘bread.
