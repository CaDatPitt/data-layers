ColIage—A-Thon raises scholarship funds

By Suzanne Sabol
For The Pitt News

Artists, young and old, put their
special touches on the 300—ft.
canvas stretched across the lawn.
Nearby, Steeler players and other
Pittsburgh personalities mingled
with the crowd enjoying Hot-
licks’ ribs and hot jazz from the
Dave Harger Group.

This was the scene of the
Colossal Collage-A-Thon on
Saturday at the Pittsburgh Center
for the Arts. It was an event

~ designed to create interest in the

next four years.

The debate was part of the fall
meeting of the Consortium of
Professional Education Organiza-
tions of Western Pennsylvania
Thursday in the Pitt Union.

The Consortium was organized
last year by the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Education to en-
courage communication among
educators at all levels.

”There is no worry that the
neediest students are going to be

arts and gain members for the
center.

”People should see what’s..tak—
ing place and what's available
here. It's a wonderful center to be
involved in,” said former Steeler
Rocky Blier. He was on hand to
promote the event, having been
involved in the arts for the past
15 years.

Blier toured the grounds, view-
ing the work being done on the
huge canvas. He also added
something of his own, which he
called a ”contempoary abstract

painting.” His work, along with .

put out and not be able to get a
good education,” said Donahue.
Donahue said that Vice Presi-
dent Bush would work closely
with the present educational es-
tablishment to build on the excel-
lence which Bush claims already
exists in American schools.

- Character development is ’_’sec-
ond to none” on the list of things
Bush would promote in educa-
tion, said Donahue.

”Discipline in the classroom

other artists, will be auctioned oh‘
later this year to add to the
center's scholarship fund.

According to Lisa Cohen, one
coordinator of the Co|lage—A—
Thon, over 1000 people were ex-
pected for the day, and up to 300
could be accomodated on the
canvas at one time.

Out of this number, many were
parents and children. Walt Wie-
wiora brought his sons, Eric and
Brett, because ”|t’s a great,
healthy, wholesome environment
for the kids. I want to encourage

‘ means less emphasis on student

rights and more on student
responsibilities. Students need
discipline and authority,” Dona-
hue said.

According to Donahue, a
Republican administration would
encourage ”better pay for better
teachers” and would ”build
upon” the Head Start Program.

local teachers’ union, spoke on

The artists were free to let their
artistic flair show by painting,
sewing, gluing and drawing on
the collage. Anne Shratter,11,

on a fall foliage scene, made of

impressed by the event and said
it was exciting ”to be rubbing
shoulders with people who real-
ly know what they're doing.”

Laser
Surgery
lights
the way

By Ugochi Oyoyo

Staff Writer

The same beam of light that
thrills audiences during laser light
shows and rock concerts is il-
luminating the path to safer and
less painful medical and dental
care.

Dr. Steven l. Kaltman, an oral
and maxillofacial surgeon at
Montefiore Hospital, helped to
bring laser surgery technique to
Pittsburgh. '

In 1981, Kaltman enrolled in a
weel<—long course at North-

’ western University instructed by

Dr. Bernard Picaro, a pioneer in
the incorporation of laser tech-
nology into medical procedures.

After he learned how to re-
move lesions and perform other
surgical techniques with lasers,
Kaltman returned to Montefiore
to put this knowledge into
practice.

So, ”don’t think for a minute
that St. Francis Hospital had the
first laser center in the area,” said
Dr. Robert G. Selker, chief of
neurosurgery at Montefiore
Hospital.

Lasers offer more precision and
control than conventional surgi-
cal instruments do, allowing phy-
sicians and dentists to treat
problems more thoroughly and
safely than they could previous-
ly, and to even treat problems un-
approachable with non-laser
surgery.

For example, ”with many
mouth cancers,” said Kaltman,
”rather than removing chunks of
tissue, we locate the target [dis-
eased tissue], hit it with the laser
and remove it, leaving healthy tis-
sue behind.”

”Lasers allow us to operate on
lesions that couldn't be done any
other way, like those at the base
of the skull,” said Selker. ”There
are some chemicals that get
trapped in the DNA of brain
tumors, but would clear through
in the normalbrain. Laser light

splits the chemical in the DNA,

killing only the tumor cells and
leaving healthy tissue behind.”

Less bleeding occurs with laser
surgery, and this is especially im-
portant for those operations as-
sociated with high volumes of
blood loss such as surgery on
blood vessel tumors.

”With laser techniques," said
Kaltman, ”blood loss is about a
teaspoon or less.”

College rioting continues as 50 students jailed‘

ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) -
Hundreds of rioting students
burned furniture and clashed
with police in the second night of
homecoming weekend violence
that resulted in 50 arrests by
officers clad in riot gear, police
said Sunday.

At least six people, including a
police officer and a person found
in a trash carrier, were treated at
a hospital for minor injuries
suffered Saturday night and ear-
ly Sunday, said hospital nursing
supervisor Patricia Anderson.

As many as 1,500 St. Cloud
State University students were in-
volved in the rioting in a four-
block area on Friday and Satur-

day nights, Assistant Police Chief
Jim Moline said.

Students set off firecrackers,
and some played the Beatles’
song ”Revo|ution” on a stereo as
police swept through the crowd,
estimated at about 700 people
Saturday night. Other people tore
down street signs and jumped on
cars, or threw beer bottles and
pieces of lumber.

About 60 officers, including
some from the State Patrol and
neighboring counties, shot tear

gas to disperse the crowd and 1
made 46 arrests, most on mis— '

demeanor charges of unlawful
conduct or criminal damage to
property, Moline said.

,,Couples’ claims on child stir controversy Collage——

By George Esper
AP Special Correspondent

WAUCHULA, Fla. (AP) — In
the festive season between
Thanksgiving and Christmas of
1978, two little girls were born
within three days of each other in
Hardee Memorial Hospital.

One girl was an only child. She
grew up strong, doing the things
she loved like roller skating and
swimming. But another side of

her life was tragic. Her mother
died of cancer when she was
only three, and five years later,
her stepmother left after divorc-
ing her father.

The other girl grew up with a
faint heart, in and out of hospi-
tals, unable to run like the rest of
the kids, instead turning to the pi-
ano, dressing up and daydream-
ing of becoming a model. She
had seven sisters and brothers.

The sick girl, Arlena Twigg,

died too young, at age 9, a smile
on her face, fighting valiantly to
survive the heart that was
defective.

Now, a decade after the girls
were born, comes a startling reve-
lation, along with allegations and
intrigues that have turned the
lives of their families upside
down.

Arlena Twigg’s parents say they
learned shortly before her death,
two months ago, that she was not

their daughter by birth. Blood
and genetic testing required for
surgery confirmed it.

They allege the hospital
deliberately swapped babies on
them, that their real child is
heahhy.

They think they know who she
IS.

At issue are the credibility_and
the motives of the two families,
strangers to each other, the mys-

The swelling and bleeding as-
sociated with conventional sur-
gery on the removal of
drug-caused excessive gum over-
growth is reduced with laser sur-
gery, says the Pennsylvania
Dental Association.

Laser surgery is also a steriliz-
ing technique. ”When a tumor is
removed, it is not spread because
the beam sterilizes the area,” said
Kaltman. ’

In root canal treatment, when

the inside of a tooth has become’

infected, laser technique can
sterilize the region so that the
contaminated segment may be
removed and replaced with a

’ surgery,

to all areas of medicine and den-
tistry. ’’People have been brain-
washed to think that you can aim
a beam through bone,” said Selk-
er. ”A laser can cut through
bone," said Kaltman, ”but you
risk igniting the bone.”

”We first have to cut through
the skull before operating with
the laser,” said Selker.

Bony tumors often recur after
conventional surgical treatment.
’’It is purely experimental at this
stage,” said Kaltman, ”but after
lasering the diseased bone of
some of our patients  we have
had anywhere from three to six
years of no recurrence of the
tumor.” »

For those areas of medicine
that can effectively utilize laser
it is a cost-effective
procedure.

Not only is it relatively quick,
”about a half an hour or less 
and usually performed on an out-
patient level,’’ said Kaltman, but
”the patient’s hospital stay is
drastically reduced, and at about

$3,000 a day, that means the cost
of post-operative care is less.”

There are some disadvantages
to the procedure. Some laser
techniques take longer to per-
form, ”up to several hours
longer,” said Selker, ”but it
doesn't show up in the surgeon's
fee.” Also, ”it takes around 21
days to heal, which is about a
week longer than conventional
surgery,” said Kaltman.

”A surgeon feels with his hands
as he cuts,” added Kaltman, ”but
laser surgery is a no-touch tech-
nique [becuase they are] away
from the tissue holding the instru-
ment [laser control], and" that
takes a little getting used to.”

”Lasers allow you to work on
a lesion without touching it,” said
Selker, ”and that means the sur-
geon has to develop a different
tactile sense.” '

Three types of lasers are com-
monly used in medicine and den-
tistry: the argon laser, carbon
dioxide laser, and YAG laser.

used in ophthalmology for such
procedures as sealing torn retinae
which could detach and cause
specks to appear in the field of
vision.

The carbon dioxide laser is the
most common one among neu-
rosurgeons, maxillofacial sur-
geons and general surgeons, used
to ”vaporize tissue,” said
Kaltman.

A YAG laser is often used by
ophthalmologists to open the eye
membrane to relieve such condi-
tions as clouding which obscure
vision.

”The one we have now [a car-
bon dioxide laser] is 10 years old,
so we're going to update it,"
said Kaltman. ”We’re also going
to buy a new YAG laser, which
costs about half a million dollars.

”There’s a lot of advertising go-
ing on,” said Kaltman, ”but don't
be fooled into thinking that all up-
and-coming surgery can be done
with lasers. It's not for everyone,
but when indicated, it's the way
to go.”

Sex education: a job

for parent and teacher

The Pennsylvania House Education Committee held a hearing to
discuss a bill which would strictly regulate sex education courses in

the state's public schools.

A few of the provisions are as follows: forbidding school districts
to provide, fund or cooperate with abortion referral services, preg-
nancy testing, or contraceptive counseling; requiring any sex educa-

have had an interest in gay rights. ‘

proclaiming gay rights would in-

tice their religion. A similar
argument could be and has been
made against blacks and Jews in
the past. They should not be used
now.

What I learned more than any-
thing else at that GALA meeting

is-that, contrary to popular belief,
homosexuals are normal human
beings with fears and feelings and
emotions just like everyone,
maybe even more so because of
their predicament.

Our society forces them to be
secretive, yet we criticize them

to hide their true identity many
times to avoid persecution and
death. I am lucky that I never had
to lie about who I was and live
in constant fear of my true iden-
tity being discovered and the
persecution that would follow.
Many people have said that
dicrimination against blacks and

discrimination against homosex-
uals is different because people
can't choose whether or not they
are black. —

Well, a person can choose to
be homosexual just about as eas-
ily as he can choose his own
gender. The City Council mem-

burgh and our whole nation will
continue to carry an invisible
banner of shame, because even
with the whole civil rights move-
ment, we have still learned
nothing.

Actions of a President Quayle

The big question at the vice
presidential debate was "Is Sen.
Dan Quayle qualified to be presi-
dent of the United States?” After
listening carefully, I came to the

‘onclusion that he is. I think what
persuaded me was the answer he
gave when asked what he would
do if he were president.

He said that first of all he would
say a prayer, then he would meet
with Bush's people, whom he
had gotten to know on a first-
name basis, and then he'd use his
congressional experience to be
president of the United States.
This, of course, is a paraphrase of
Quayle's answer to the question
which he was asked three times.

I bought it all, even when

‘Quayle compared himself to John

Kennedy.

I even fantasized the scene.
Bush and Quayle have won the
election. As vice president with
nothing to do, Dan Quayle has
been persuaded by his father to
take’ a course in remedial law.
Dan is preparing for a true or false
test when a Bush aide rushes in
and says, "President Bush has
come down with a case of Mon-
golian flu and cannot function.

‘According to the 25th Amend-

ment, you're going to have to

take over as president.”
Quayle says, "This is awful, but

fortunately George Bush picked

L the most qualified person for the

job. Harry Truman was the same
age as me when he became
president.”

"You're no Harry Truman.”

"That was uncalled for. Well,
I better get ready. First, I will say
a prayer for myself and the
American people.”

"That’s a good idea, Mr. Presi-
dent. The American people need
one.”

"Then I'm going to meet with
the president's Cabinet. I know
all of them firsthand. What's the
name of the little guy with the red

"His name is ’Red,’ sir."

Cabinet. Hi, Doc. Hi, Sneezy. Hi,

president of the United States be-
cause I passed the most important
job training bill in our history,
and I know Margaret Thatcher
personally. Are there any
questions?” ,

"We have an explosive situa-
tion in the Middle East, Mr. Presi-

dent. The Iraqis and Iranians want
to resume fighting. And if that
isn't bad enough, Poland is boil-
ing over and Pinochet in Chile is
rounding up the usual suspects
again. What should we do, sir?"
"Calvin Coolidge wasn't any
older when he faced a similar sit-
uation.” '
”With all due respect, sir,
you're not Calvin Coolidge.”
"That was really uncalled for."
"What action do you want us

has prepared me for a moment
such as this. My grandmother
once said to me, ‘You can do
anything you want to, if you just

‘ set your mind to it and go to

work.’ ‘

"Now the Iranians and Iraqis
may sneer at this common-sense
advice, and the Poles may snick-
er, and Pinochet may laugh be-
hind my back, but I'll choose my
grandmother over them any
time."

"I guess that should take care
of the problems we face today,
sir."

"I am no younger than Check-
ers was when he moved into the
White House." A

"You're no Checkers."

"Will you cut that out!"

Homosexuals: a minority group

For some odd reason,
homosexuals feel that they have
some special right to be protect-
ed under the law as a minority
group.

Last week, City Council shot
down an effort to include a sexu-
al orientation clause into the ci-
ty’s anti-discrimination policy.
The three words "or sexual orien-
tation" were intended to allow
homosexuals to allege that the
reason they might not have
received a job could have been
for some reason other than their
qualifications.

This isn't to say that by being t
. homosexual, a person is in-

competent or handicapped in
some way, but rather that being
homosexual is unacceptable.
Claims that society should be
open enough to accept a person's
choice of "lifestyle" is an argu-
ment not grounded in common
sense.

The sexual orientation clause,
however, would not only have
protected homosexuals if it had
been passed, but would have
opened the flood gates in the
multitude of ways it could have
been interpreted. The clause
would also have sanctioned bes-
tial and necrophiliac tendencies
since they are also "alternative
sexual orientations."

Being a drug—addict or alcohol-
ic are also "alternative lifestyles,"
but society takes an active role in
trying to curtail such activities. By
claiming that they are a minority
group, homosexuals are trying to
assert that they had no choice in
the matter of their sexuality, and
therefore, they should not be
penalized in any way for being
the way they are.

Homosexuals like to contend

WILLIAM
YOUNG

that their sexual preference is
something quite natural and nor-
mal; and that there is no reason
for opposing it. Homosexuality,
however, is not normal or accept-
able, it is something that par-
ticipants willfully choose for
reasons of their own.

The only two types of
reproduction I've ever heard of
are asexual and heterosexual;
homosexual reproduction is a sil-
ly oxymoron. The ultimate reason
there are two sexes in the human
species is to facilitate reproduc-
tion; choosing to be homosexual
goes quite against this undenia-
ble fact. Lions, tigers and bears do
not practice homosexuality.
Neither do amoebae.

Asserting that homosexuality is
a normal occurrence is a farcical
argument. Homosexuality is an
aberration that was once consi-
dered. a mental disorder. When a
person chooses to be homosex-
ual, he or she is, for some reason

 

y choice —- not definition

or another, making a conscious
choice to go against a law of na-
ture that he or she must later justi-
fy with false rationalizations.
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance
would doubtless like to point out
the fact that they believe there are
more homosexuals at Pitt than
there are blacks, and therefore
homosexuals should be recog-
nized as a viable group. The ac-
ceptance of the sexual orientation
clause into the university's anti-

discrimination policy is a sorry .

example of how morals and com-
mon sense in today's society
have deteriorated.

Pitt's acceptance of the clause
wasn't merely a way for qualified
homosexuals to contest a per-
son's reasons for not employing
a homosexual person, but also an
admission that the university ad-
ministration condones homosex-
uality. City Council's refusal to
include the clause was a bold

statement that said a politically

active group cannot force a
morally unacceptable policy onto
the books by being loudmouths.

Homosexuals complain that
they aren't being treated fairly.
Homosexuals, however, would
be doing society a great injustice
by forcing it to accept their devi-
ant sexual tendencies. Society
has every right to throw up its
hands and say, "Enough!” when
it finds something disagreeable
trying to force itself into the sys-
tem. City Council had the moral
fortitude to do this.

Stereotyping of
Republicans wrong

LETTERS

I would like to make a few
comments about Anthony Ric-
ci's letter in the Oct. 12 edi-

tion of The Pitt News.

concerning Melanie Naro’s
statements. I am by no means
attempting to justify Ms.
Naro’s alleged views, but I am
outraged over Ricci’s  letter
and its given headline. First of
all, I know that most Republi-
cans do not feel that poor peo-
ple, in general, are not
intelligent. The notion that
Republicans are‘ "uncaring,
narrow-minded, and unAmeri-
can" reflects stereotypes
placed on us by opponents of
the party. Merely because
Republicans don't throw
money at the poor does not
mean that they are not work-
ing on alleviating the
problems of the poor. Instead
of giving the poor billions in
welfare payments, Republi-
cans advocate improving the
poor's standard of living by
creating good and accessable
[sic] jobs. Self-sufficiency, not
dependence, is the Republi-
can answer to poverty.

Mr. Ricci  criticizes Ms.
Naro for, again allegedly,
stereotyping poor as stupid.

Yet Mr. Ricci- is not-bothered»

by claiming all Republicans
are "uncaring" and share Ms-.
Naro’s supposed views. [...] ’

. In support of Playboy

I was very disturbed with
Frances Sansig's over-
opinionated column in Thur-
day's (Oct. 13) edition of The
Pitt News. Usually I don't let
Ms. Sansig's articles offend me
because they are usually so
warped and off the mark, they
are-humorous. Yet,  I find
myself writing a letter to the
editor to express my views. 

In her recent column,
Frances criticizes Playboy
magazine and, more impor-
tantly, the potential models
being interviewed on our cam-
pus for the April '89 "Girls of
the Big East Conference" pic-
torial. At one point, Frances
would have "condemned any
female who wanted to appear
nude," but now is just "am-
biviant." [sic] Who is Frances
Sansig to condemn anyone for
any reason? And better still,
why would anyone care,
anyway?

I know of at least three
friends or aquaintances [sic]
who are going to audition to
appear in the magazine, not to
be "exploited" or "violated,"
but because they have curva-
ceous bodies and natural
beauty that is a trademark of
Playboy. If Ms. Sansig has ever
seen a collegiate pictorial, she
would know that they are
done with respect to the
models, their bodies, and the
school they represent. If Ms.
Sansig is offended by the

magazine, she can choose not
to read it. She can also choose,
as she stated in her column,
not to pose for it. 

Please, don't get me wrong.
Ms. Sansig is entitled to her
opinion, and she is entitled to
express these opinions in her
column. However, for some-
one who is inspiring [sic] for
a career in broadcast or print
journalism, she needs to learn
to print both sides of the issue.
Her article has alienated any
young woman interested in
posing, not to mention the

magazine itself, all because’

she feels that the magazine is
degraded and a ”has—been." It
would be a real shame if Play-
boy took the same view of Ms.
Sansig's article that she took of
them and decided not to pho-
tograph women from Pitt for
their upcoming pictorial. [...]

Mistake on subliminals

In yourleditorial published
on Wednesday, Oct. 12, you
lumped together two decided-
ly different incidents in an at-
tempt to defend "art." In the
first incident, a film was
blamed for inciting shootings,
beatings and fights in the
Detroit area and then was can-
celed. The idea of any type of
subliminal message was
unmentioned in your account.
In the second ‘incident you
mention, a judge in Reno
sought the master tape to a Ju-
das Priest album so it could be
checked for subliminal mes-
sages that some claimed had
contributed to a suicide pact
between two teenaged boys.

The idea of subliminality is
what makes the two items en-
tirely different. Subliminal
messages are not consciously
noticed by the listener or
viewer and can affect be-
havior. Messages that are not
subliminal can also affect be-
havior, but the ‘recipient of the
message is at least aware of

‘ what it is and can consciously

choose whether or not to heed
it. (At least I would like to
think we are all capable of
such choices.) A subliminal
message is like. slipping some-
one a mickey. The person
knows they've had a drink or
listened to a recording, but not
about the little extra that was
included with the drink or the
"art."

How much effect a sublimi-
nal message may have is an ar-
guable point. Even if the
recording in question includes
subliminals, it would probably
be difficult to prove they actu-
ally caused or contributed to
behavior as extreme as sui-
cide. But the distinction be-
tween subliminals and other
types of messages is still an im-
portant one. I think you were
in error to look at both of these
incidents in the same light.

THE PITT NEWS

Monday, October 17, W88

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers (3-3) have
played three tough games in a
row (West Virginia, Boston
College and Notre Dame), los-
ing all three.

This week, the Temple Owls

are the same Owls who have
beaten the Panthers two years
running. Something had to
give. 1

It was the Panthers who
mixed a strong offense with a
patchwork defense and came
out on top with a 42-7 score
on Saturday.

’’It is good to feel a win
again,” Pitt coach Mike Gott-
fried said. ”For the last three
weeks, we have been playing
well, but we don't have the
wins to show for it. Today we
played well on defense and on
offense. Plus we got to play a
lot of players, which is always
good.” ‘

The Panther defense was out
to show that, despite injuries
and inexperience on their part,
they were every bit as good as
anyone. A

They stopped the multi-
bone offense ofsthe Owls on
three straight downs and
forced a punt. _

Pitt took the ball on their
own 39 and ‘drove down the
field to the 1-yard line. Tight
end Vernon Kirk scored on a
pitch from quarterback Dar-
nell Dickerson to put the Pan-
thers on the board.
Place-kicker Scott Kaplan
made it 7-0.

”That play has been in our
playbook all year,”» Gottfried
said..”We ran it earlier in the

to pitch it that time."
The second quarter be-
longed to Pitt. The Panthers

(1-4) stood in their way. These 1

opened up with a 7-yard Cur-
vin Richards run up the mid-
dle for a touchdown. Pitt led

14-0.

Afters holding the Temple
offense down, the Panthers
took over the ball on their own
47. They quickly drove down
the field, with Dickerson pass-
ing the ball down to the Tem-
ple 27. Richards then took
over the offense and five plays
later, the Panthers were at the
2. They ran the same" play to
Kirk, who scored again. The
score was 21-0.

’’It felt great to score a
touchdown,” Kirk said, ”any
way I can score a touchdown.
It doesn't matter if I run in,
receive a ball or cover a fum-
ble in the end zone. Just so I
score.”

The Pitt defense continued
to shine on the next series,
holding the Owls to only three
plays before they had to punt.
Temple's Ed Liberati put his
foot into the ball. It ended up
73 yards down the field and
rolled through the end zone
for a touchback.

_ Ten plays later, Dickerson
hit Billy Osborn with a 25-yard
scoring strike to put the Pan-
thers even further out of reach.

”That play was just a simple
out route,” Osborn said. ”Dar-
nell got a little pressure and 1
got flushed out of the pocket;
he got away from the rush and
got the ball to me. I'm just
thankful that I got my feet un-
derneath it.”

The half ended with no
more scoring threats, and Pitt"
led 28-0.

”We just made too many
mistakes on defense today,”
Temple coach Bruce Arians
said. ”Dickerson. is a good
player. I thought we had him
sacked a couple of times, but

Leftovers from Pitt's 42-7 victo-
ry over Temple last Saturday:

0 Pitt running back Curvin
Richards, who gained 135 yards
on 25 carries for an average of

-5.4 yards per carry, continues to

lead the Panther rushing game
with 523 yards. Richards is aver-
aging a healthy 6.1 yards per car-
ry this year.

32,832 people at Saturday's con-
test drops the average home at-
tendance for 1988 from 51,183
down to 47,513. What is the top
average home attendance? Exact-
ly 54,818 in_ 1982.

0 Senior middle linebacker Jer-
ry Olsavsky, who had an incredi-
ble 21 tackles last week against
Notre Dame, had only four
against the Owls. But Olsavsky
still leads the team in tackles with
75, 31 more than the second-

leading tackler, Curtis Bray.

called it, to an I-formation in an
attempt to exploit Pitt's loss of
defensive tackle Marc Spindler,

but to no avail. The Owls gained
96 yards rushing, but lost 43
yards for a net total of 53 yards.

0 Temple had won three of the
past four meetings between the
two schools, including the last
two in a row, but the Pitt victory
gives the Panthers an all-time ser-
ies edge of 14-4-1.

0 Temple running back Todd
McNair gained more yards last
season against Pitt (213) than he
has gained all this season.

McNair has just 198 yards
through five games, including a
respectable, though not spectacu-

lar, 59 yards on 12 carries against .

Pitt.

0 Quarterback Darnell Dicker-
son had by far his best game as
a Panther, completing 15 of 21
passes (71 percent) for 287 yards.
Previously, Dickerson’s finest
outing was his 209-yard perfor-
mance last week against Notre
Dame. For what it's worth, KDKA
sportscaster John Stiegerwald has
called Dickerson the most excit-
ing football player in Pittsburgh.

0 Defensive end Burt Gross-
man described the mood in the
locker room before thegame as
subdued and businesslike. The
team knew what had to be done
and did it. C-rossman also indicat-
ed that he is just about fully reco-

Volleyball team beats

The Lady Panthers had an
emotion-filled weekend at the
Arizona Volleyball Classic. On
Friday evening, Pitt upset the
15th-ranked squad from the
University of Arizona, while
on Saturday and Sunday they
were defeated by LSU and
Houston, respectively.

The Lady Panthers record
stands at 14-5.

The opening match on Fri-
day against Arizona went to a
deciding fifth game after the
teams split the first four games.

The situation looked bleak
for the Lady Panthers as Arizo-
na took a commanding 14-6
lead. It was at that point that
Pitt coach Shelton Collier in-
serted outside hitter Kelly
Matheis into the game.

Matheis ignited the Lady
Panthers on offense, and the
resultant Pitt firestorm was not
finished until Arizona had
been consumed by a 16-14

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October I7, I988

   

Tolbatt shows off world-renowned squash skills .

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

Squash was the big story Thurs-
day night at the downtown City
Club. No, the local farmers didn't

- proudly display their best fall

vegetables at the exclusive fitness
center.

Rather, squash, the fast-paced
racquet sport, was in the news as
the No. 1 ranked player in the
world, Mark Tolbatt, was in town
tojchallenge some of the Pitts-
burgh area's top players.

Tolbatt, who has dominated
the sport throughout the 1980s,
played exhibition sets of squash
throughout Thursday to raise
money for the Pittsburgh Squash
Racquets Association.

Rob Goldman, manager of the
City Club, said, ”We hope that by
bringing Mark Tolbatt to Pitts-
burgh, we’ are giving squash en-

thusiasts a unique opportunity.”

The lanky 28-year-old champ
didn't let anybody down. The
highlight of the night matched
Tolbatt against Pittsburgh's only
teaching professional squash
player, Duilio Costa.

Costa remained close in game
one of the three-game set, but
Tolbatt’s mix of power and
finesse shots wore down Costa as
Tolbatt won, 17-14.

Costa came back in game two
and won 17-15. But Tolbatt’s ex-
perience and excellent ball place-
mentxfinished off Costa in the
decisive third game, 17-16.

Tolbatt admitted to getting a lit-
tle tricky in the set. In game one,
Tolbatt hit one ball behind his
back and one ball between his
legs in succession.

”They’re not high percentage
shots, and I probably wouldn't
use them in a tournament, but I'm

careful when I use them,” said
Tolbatt.

But Tolbatt didn't have room to
get too fancy as Costa remained
close in all three of the games.
Costa was particularly impressive
with his ball placement and
bursts of power. Costa’s power
even surprised the world's top
ranked player.

”He can really hit the ball hard
when he wants to,” said Tolbatt.

After the match, Tolbatt offered
some advice to beginning squash
players. A

”I’ve always been known as a
defensive player, but it's best to
keep a lot of pressure on your op-
ponent. It’s important in squash
to keep attacking, make the other
guy do the running,” he said.

Tolbatt added a little technique
advice: ”Balance is really impor-
tant. You should try to stay on
your toes as much as possible,

but hit the ball with a wide
stance.”

Tolbatt explained that he
doesn't have much time for train-
ing throughout the year. He most-
ly plays practice games with the
other professional squash players
in the vicinity of his Rhode Island
home.

”The only running I do is a few
court sprints, no distance. I have
to pace myself because I play so
much during the year,” said
Tolbatt.

Playing squash should be
enough to keep just about any-
body in shape. Squash is consi-
dered the No. 2 ranked
cardiovascular fitness sport, be-
hind crossicountry skiing.

Squash is the oldest of all the
racquet sports. It was invented in
a British prison in the late 1700s.
The name was derived from the
sound a squash ball makes when

it bounces off the wall.

Squash is similar to racquetball
but has some dimensional differ-
ences. A squash ball is harder and
smaller than a racquetball. A
squash racquet has a longer han-
dle and smaller head, which
makes it look similar to a badmin-
ton racket. The squash court is’
also smaller than a racquetball
coun.

Squash and racquetball also
differ in the physical ability need-
ed to play.

According to Costa, "Squash
requires more athletic ability than
racquetball because of the limits
on the players. There's less con-
trol of the racquet. Speed, flexi-
bility and superior eye/hand

‘coordination are also factors.”

Bobby Lewis, head baseball
coach at Pitt and squash instruc-
tor, agrees that squash is more

he shook us off, broke loose
and completed a couple long
passes.”

The second half started with
the ball in Pitt's hands, but it
didn't stay there long as the
Temple defense was able to
shut them down.

After a Washington punt,
Temple took over the ball on
their own 28-yard line. They
changed their scheme back to
the l—formation at this point
and started mixing the pass
with the run.

”Pitt took away our short
passing game early [in the
game],” Arians said. ”Chang—
ing the offense was something
that I wanted to do three
weeks ago. This was the best
time to do it.”

Temple moved down the
field with new-found fire and
scored six plays later on a
24-yard pass from Baker to
Kevin McCoy. The Owls were
back in the game at 28-7.

”After they scored the
touchdown, they were starting

to rally around the ball,” Os-
I born said. ”They were jump-
, ing around and hootin’ and
hollerin’. They were fired up.
”Sometimes you can just
feel it on the sidelines, you
know, ‘Here we go again.’ But
today, we just sucked it in and
played the whole game. We
had to keep the pressure on.”
Pitt answered the Temple
TD with one of their own, a
45-yard Dickerson run to
make the score 35-7.

“Our offense was really
working well,” said Richards,
who gained 135 yards on the
ground. ”The exectution was
perfect. Everything worked
great.”

The Panthers scored once
more. Early in the fourth quart-
er, running back Ricky Turner
scored from four yards out to
make the final score 42-7.

”We were expected to beat
I this team by more than 21

points,” Richards said. ”We
did that. It was a good win."

”We were ready for them
this year," defensive end Burt
Grossman said. ”We weren't
- going to let them repeat last
year.”

The Pitt soccer team took Car-
negie Mellon to double overtime
last Wednesday, but neither team
could take advantage of the ex-

. tra periods as the game ended in

a 1-1 tie.

The Panthers remained at .500
with the tie, their record settling
at 4-4-1.

The Tartans scored first, taking
advantage of an officia|’s whistle
that was never blown.

With the ball in the Pitt zone,
sweeper Dan Liberati and keep-
er Jay Kapusta chased the ball to
the end line assuming a goal kick
would follow. Kapusta raised his
hands to signal that the ball was
out of bounds, but the official

Q didn't agree.

As Kapusta scrambled back to

the net, a CMU midfielder
crossed the ball off of Liberati’s
chest and into the Pitt goal at
25:35.

CMU forward Rob Schaeffer
was credited with the goal since
he was the last Tartan to touch
the ball.

”I was running with the ball,
and I raised my hand, and they
didn't call it. That ball was out by
a foot-and-a half! I still can't be-
lieve it," Kapusta said.

The score remained 1-0 in
CMU’s favor until the onset of the
second half, when midfielder
Mark Mostinckx broke his stride
as he ran onto the playing field,
turning to say, ”I’m going to
score; I can feel it.”

Four minutes into the half,
Mostinckx received a beautiful
touch pass from Heinz Pak on the
left side and nailed a shot into the

 

left corner. And that proved to be
all the scoring that was to take
place, although Pak drew some
oohs and ahs from the fans as he
booted a rocket from 35 yards out
that hit the top post.

Coach Joe Luxbacher was ex-
tremely pleased with his squad’s
performance. ”We did some
good things out there. CMU is a
good team. Scott McCurry was
tremendous, and we shut them

down offensively.”

Indeed. The Panther offense
was patient, controlled and effec-
tive. Pitt kept the ball on CMU’s
half of the field for 35 minutes of
the first half. Mostinckx and Pak
were the two major scoring
threats for the Panthers, aided by
midfielder Bryan Hammond,
strikers Mike Laus and Chris Rid-
ing and team captain Sam Lanza.

also played an instrumental part
in setting up the offense with his
effective passing and trapping
skills.

The most impressive individu-
al effort, by team consensus,
however, was put forth by sopho-
more fullback McCurry. McCur-
ry was responsible for marking
one of the more dangerous for-
wards in the tri-state area, Ed
Park. Park had 23 points entering
the game and was fresh off a
CMU-record four-goal game
against Grove City.

However, Park was offensive-
ly ineffective thanks to McCurry,
who outdueled him on head
balls, stuffed his passes, and stuck
to him like glue throughout the
entire game. ‘ r

In fact, Park had to come off the
field limping a few times due to
McCurry’s extremely aggressive

play.

”I just tried to mark him close-
ly the whole game. I didn't let
him turn on me at all,” McCurry
said. ”I don't think he did much
in the game.”

Assistant coach Bob Campbell
agreed. ”I think Scotty is our best
defender, and he showed that
tonight.” '

Despite the solid play of the Pitt
squad, the game was marked by
fluke plays, much like CMU’s
contested goal.

Late in the first half, the Pan-
thers had the ball inside the CMU
7, and on an attempt to head the
ball in for a score, striker Riding
was shoestring tackled by keep-
er Glenn Hoogerwerf. It ap-
peared that Pitt was going to
receive a penalty kick. However,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, Qclober l7, 1988

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Houston Oilers’ coach Jerry
Glanville didn't shake Steelers’
coach Chuck Noll’s hand after his
team handed the Steelers a 34-14
drubbing yesterday afternoon,
and he wasn't about to.

Last season, Noll berated Glan-
ville in the middle of the field in
front of national cameras about
the tough hitting the Oilers put on

the Steelers.

”He went one way ‘and I went
the other,” Glanville said. ’’I had
no intention of shaking his hand.
He got me once; he ain’t gonna
get me twice.”

The Oilers totally dominated

1 this game while improving their

record to 5-2. The Steelers

dropped to 1-6. ~

’’I’m not proud of anything o
there today,” Noll said. ”There’s
no question that we've got some
deep-seated problems, and it be-
gins in [the] belief in [one]self.
Losing certainly doesn't help. It's
a question of confidence in their
own abilities.”

The entire game was summed
up late in the third quarter. With
the Steelers down 25-7 and driv-
ing down the field, quarterback
Todd Blackledge threw his sec-
ond ‘interception of the game
right into the hands of Houston

strong safety Kenny Johnson.

Johnson returned the ball 51
yards to the Steelers’ 49. Four
plays later, the Oilers were down
to the 34 on a pass from Oiler QB
 /arren Moon to tight end Jamie

THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO

Williams, but the Houston bench
was flagged for a personal foul,
and the Oilers were faced with a
third—and-17.

This was the big chance for
Pittsburgh to get back in the
game. Moon threw an incom-
plete pass to Hill, but Steelers’ Jer-
ry Reese was called offsides.

No problem — it was still third-
and-12. The Oilers ran the same
play, and it resulted in another in-
complete pass. But another flag
was thrown: offsides on Pitts-
burgh’s Aaron Jones.

It was now third-and—seven.
Moon tried a different play, but
it yielded the same results: an in-
complete pass. This time Steeler
Keith Gary lined up offsides. The
Oilers moved down the field by
just snapping the ball.

 

On thi_rd—and-two, running
back Mike Rozier ran up the mid-
dle for a first down. Six plays
later, Tony Zendejas put the Oil-
ers up 28-7. The Steelers weren't
even close the rest of the way.

’’It was just a lack of concen-
tration on our part,” Jones said.
’’I was lined up in the neutral
zone. I just wasn't thinking. I
think we were trying too hard.”

Houston stuffed Rozier straight
up the middle on 10 of 12 plays
to start the game. Houston led 6-0
after a botched extra point try.

”We had to establish the run
early,” Moon said. ”That way
when we were ready to pass,
they might not have been expect-
ing it.”

Four plays after the Steelers got

Glanville, Oilers say talk is cheap in 34-14 win

Zendejas field goal, and the Oil-
ers were up 9-0 early in the sec-
ond half. ,

The Houston defense stuffed
the Steelers on three plays and
forced Harry Newsome to punt
from deep in his own end zone.
The snap skidded along the
ground, and the kick was blocked
out of the end zone for a safety.

”l don't think there is any ques-
tion that our special teams has be-
come a great strength in this
football team,” Glanville said. ’’It
is worth the price of admission
just to watch our special teams
play. We are crazy enough that
we think we are going to block
a couple kicks every game.”

Houston scored once more in
the half on a 43-yard TD pass
from Moon to wide receiver Er-
nest Givins.

Stee|ers——

best drive of the day during the
second quarter when they went
80 yards for a touchdown. The
score was 18-7 Houston and
stayed that way the rest of the
half.

”The game was a lot closer
than the score,” Glanville said.
”We got the breaks this week;
that made all the difference. I
don't think we are a much better
team than they are.”

Houston scored the only points
of the third quarter when Allen
Pinkett scored from one yard out
to make the score 25-7.

The fourth quarter saw the Oi l‘-
ers substitute freely, but they
were still able to score two more
times, on a 27-yard Zendeyas
field goal and a 24-yard touch-
down pass from Moon to Hill.

With the score 34-7, Pittsburgh
drove 73 yards down the field,
and Merril Hoge scored from one
yard out to make the final score
34-14.

Blackledge summed up the
play of the Steelers, and the
whole game in general, better
than anyone when he said, ’’It
was bad."

F .
Arizona-—

Continued from page 11
lied 13.

The LSU match was another
five-game thriller, but this
time, the Lady Panthers were
unable to secure the victory.

After being soundly defeat-
ed in game one, 2-15, the Pitt
women rallied to take the next
two games 15-13 and 15-12.
After Pitt lost the closely con-
tested fourth game by a 14-16
score, the stage was set for a
deciding game five.

LSU stormed out to a 13-7
lead before the Lady Panthers
regrouped to run off the next
six points to knot the match at
13. At that point, LSU came
back to nail down the decid-
ing two points and garner a
hard-fought verdict over Pitt.

”The loss against LSU was a
disheartening loss because
they are a nationally respect-

V ed program, and we felt we
were capable of winning the
match,” said Collier.

Pitt, by virtue of administer-
ing Arizona's only defeat in
the tournament, met Houston
on Sunday with an opportuni-
ty to capture the tournament
title.

Despite a valiant effort by a
youthful Pitt unit, they were
defeated in four games —
13-15, 9-15, 15-9 and 10-15.

”We fought hard,[but]
Houston just outplayed us.
Houston has improved as a
team since last year, while we
are integrating younger players
into key roles,” assessed
Collier.

”Sue Zonneville and
Heather Hollands played real-
ly well for us. Dee MacAulay
played her best match of the
season, narrowly missing
selection to the all-tournament
team,” said Collier.

Despite limited playing time
against Houston, Frawley to-
taled 61 kills for the weekend
and was third-placed Pitt's
lone representative on the all-
tourney team.

Art and reason

When Mark and I decided to spend
the weekend at his mother’s house,
I never imagined I would be walking
into a mouse’s nightmare. There were .

cats everywhere

Cat plaques

, cat statues, cat clocks,

even a cat mat. I couldn’t begin to dupli-

cate her collection of kitty litter ifI spent

a year at a garage sale. Conspicuously

I thought, and
weekend with

absent, however, was a real cat. Strange,

lot less than purr-fect.
But then she came home, and
Mark introduced her. She was
dressed surprisingly wel l——no
leopard pants. In fact, you
could say she was the cat’s meow,
but I’d rather not.
She offered me a cup ofDutch Choc-
olate Mint. Now that was something
I could relate to. Then she brought it
out in the most beautiful, distinctly
unfeline china I°d ever seen. As we

began to fear that a
cat woman could be a

sipped, I found out that Mrs. Campbell
has my same weakness for chocolate,
loves the theater as much as I do, but,

incredibly, never saw “Cats? So Mark
and I are takingher next month.

Hurricanes    

in Top 20

(AP)— The Miami football team
found Out what the UCLA basket-
ball team could have told them:
NO winning streak is sacred
against Notre Dame-

The Fighting Irish, who ended
UCLA's record 88-game winning

streak in‘ 1974, handed the Hur— .

ricanes their first loss in more
than three years, edging Miami
31-30 Saturday.

Everything seemed to favor Mi-
ami. Besides the regular-season
winning streak, the defending na-
tional champions also owned
winning streaks Of 16 games
overall and 20 On the road.

In addition, three years ago,
Miami handed Notre Dame one
Of its most humiliating defeats, a
58-7 crushing in the Orange
Bowl, marking a low point in the
Irish program and Gerry Faust’s
last game as head coach. Last
year, Notre Dame was beaten by
Miami 24-O.

And the Hurricanes had one of
the nation's Outstanding quarter-
backs in Steve Walsh.

But Notre Dame got its long-
awaited revenge Saturday, as free
safety Pat Terrell, who earlier
returned an interception 60 yards
for a second-period touchdown,
broke up a two-point conversion
pass with 45 seconds left.

”This was a win by the Notre
Dame spirit,” Coach Lou Holtz
said after the biggest Irishgwin in
years. ’’It was a win by the spirit
of a group of guys who just re-
fused to fold and believed. You
can't pick out a hero. Notre
Dame was the hero today.”

The Irish broke a 21-21 tie
when Pat Eilers ran two yards for
a tie-breaking, third-quarter
touchdown, the first of his career,
two plays after Notre Dame
turned back a fake punt.

Reggie Ho's 27-yard field goal
late in the third period made it
31-21, and Notre Dame survived
three Miami scoring threats in the
final 7:04. Walsh threw for four
touchdowns and 424 yards, both
all-time highs against Notre
Dame, but the Fighting Irish
negated that by intercepting him

thrashed the Owls in 1977 by a

Pitt is a new school record. The

”Penn State and every other

know now that Syracuse is for

”There’s often an instant suc-

- cess when learning to play rac-

quetball. Squash, however, takes
more drilling, practice, and prob-
ably most important, patience,”
said Lewis.

Lewis, who teaches racquetball

and squash at Pitt, has noticed a
recent decrease of the interest in
squash among Pitt students. In
fact, due to lack of student in-
terest, Pitt had to cancel the
squash class this semester. But if
interest rises, Lewis said he
would be happy to instruct
squash again at Pitt.
