T.]. Warren draws attention any time he
steps onto a basketball court. He’s not
ﬂashy in his style of play, but to put it sim-
ply, Warren is simply a defense’s nightmare.

And when Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
prepared a game plan against N.C. State, he
wasn’t focusing on anyone other than the
sophomore forward, who leads the Atlantic
Coast Conference in scoring. T

“In this game, we were more concerned
about him [than anyone else] ,” Dixon said.

, “We felt like he was the guy that could get

him going. Other games you might look
at not letting the other guys getting their
average, but this guy’s going to get shots up
and you can’t let him get going and that’s
what he did.”

Warren torched the Panthers for 41
points on a remarkably efﬁcient 16-of-22
shooting from the ﬁeld ——- both record-
setting totals at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter — and 6-of-7 from the line and added
three 3—pointers and ﬁve rebounds as the
Wolfpack topped Pitt, 74-67, Monday night.

“T.]. Warren gets 41 points tonight, but
its an unselﬁsh 41,” Wolfpack coach Mark
Gottfried said. “He was special, especially

curlers sweep
through winter

Elizabeth Furiga

Jacki Temple started curling because of
a joke with her Canadian ex-husband.

“He thought it would be funny to get a
Southern girl out on the ice to do a thing
she’d never heard of before,” she said.

Temple, 37, is a Pittsburgh Curling
Club member originally from South
Carolina.

From October to March, the club
practices and plays every Saturday at
Robert Morris University’s Neville Is-
land Ice Sports Center. The club, which

was founded in 2002, has 86 members,

ranging in age from teens to 75 years old.

Curling, a traditional Scottish sport,
has gained popularity in recent years
through coverage in the Winter Olym-
pics. V -

In curling, the thrower of a four-
person team launches a 42-pound stone
down an ice rink toward the house, or the

lbullseye target marked on either end of
the sheet of ice. The thrower wears curl-
ing shoes, as do all members, and slides
on their n_on-dominant foot, which has
teﬂon on the sole.

CURLING  

tached to broom handles, sweep the
ice in front of the stone to help it slide
by slightly melting the ice. Sweepers
score points depending on how close
the stone is to the center of the house
when it stops moving.

A curling game between members of
Pittsburgh Curling Club is often accom-
panied by shouts of, “Sweep! Sweep!” as
teammates encourage sweepers from
the sidelines of Neville Rink.

A league within the club called Can-
Am creates teams among club members
who then compete against one another.
The spring league finals will take place
Saturday, March 8, according to the
club’s website.

Temple said the team also attends
regional tournaments called bonspiels.

According to club member Amanda
Marchitelli, 34, the club sent a women’s
team to the United States Curling As-
sociation Inaugural Arena Nationals
in Fort Wayne, Ind., last year. The club
hopes to send a team to this ]une’s na-

tional competition in Dimondale, Mich.

Temple attested to the strategy in-
volved in curling. She serves on the
club’s board and helps to plan the club’s
Tropicurl summer curling bonspiel, or
tournament, as part of her duties.

“It’s a game of strategy, the same
way billiards and chess is a game of
strategy,” Temple said. “You’re con-
stantly trying to outthink your opponent
and ﬁgure out angles and weight, and
sometimes thinking two or three or ﬁve
moves ahead.” ' .

Temple said she now enjoys the sport
especially for the friendliness and ca-
maraderie. ’

Brian Stuart, 55, the club’s vice presi-
dent, has been curling for more than 40
years. As a 12-year-old, his next-door
neighbor curled while he played hockey.
He decided to try curling and found he
was much better at curling than hockey.

Stuart feels there’s something unique a

about this sport. .
“There’s a spirit to this game,” Stuart
said, “the spirit of curling. Win gra-
ciously, lose gracefully.”
According to Stuart, a club mem-

ber from Adams Township who wishes
to remain anonymous donated land to
the club to make a curling-only facility.
Right now, the team has difficulty secur-
ing ice time and can practice and play
only once a week at the Neville Island
Sports Center in the winter season.

Stuart said Adams Township ap-
proved the plans, and the club is 070
percent funded for the building of the
curling facility. . y

According to Temple, the project will
cost $1.4 million. The club still needs
another $400,000 to begin construc-
tion. -
Temple said in an email that mem-
bers, their friends, members of other
curling clubs and local or national foun-
dations and corporations have provid-
ed monetary funding for the project.
Temple said other clubs have donated
equipment.

The club can utilize the new space to
extend the sport of curling to a broad
range of members, Stuart said. p

“We’d have youth curling for kids. We
have a set of little rocks, so kids young
as 8 can play,” he said. “We’ll have curl-

ing for seniors, adults, college kids and
wheelchair curling.”

Another member, Amanda Marchitel-
li, 34, has curled for eight years and
was drawn to curling after watching the
Olympics several years ago.

“Watching the Olympics pretty much
nailed it for me,” Marchitelli said.

Marchitelli added that her husband
brought her to curling lessons to cel-
ebrate their anniversary eight years ago.

“It’s something I’m able to do and my
husband is able to do at the same time,”
she said. “Pretty much onceyou get out
and deliver a rock, you fall in love.” '

Stuart said new curlers should come

out to Learn to Curl, a half~hour or two~ '

hour session hosted by the club that
teaches attendees how to sweep, throw

a stone and play a game of curling at the ‘

Island Sports Center. The sessions take
place throughout February and March.

For ﬁrst-time curlers, the sport can
seem intimidating. -

“Don’t be afraid of looking silly the
first time you try it. Don’t be afraid to
fall a little bit,” Temple said. “Go out and
have fun. That’s what curling is about.”

COLUMN

Matt Barnes
Columnist

Budget cuts and insufficient funds have be-
come common reasons why schools across
the country have begun to cut crucial pro-
grams out of a student’s education. Along
with the increasing emphasis on rigid stan-
dardized tests as the uncontested means to
evaluate performance, it seems that schools
are beginning to lose the innovative, creative
nature of learning.

Well hereis an idea to promote educa-
tional productivity: School boards should
invest in an area of study that has been proven
to enhance the learning process, stimulate the
brain, , substantially assist lower—socioeco-

nomic students and, yes, increase standard- V

ized test scores.
This area is music.
Unfortunately, school administrators na-

tionwide have not widely adopted this sug-
gestion. In recent years, cuts toward public
education in the budgets‘ of Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Corbett have reduced state funding
by more than $1 billion. With such ‘drastic
reductions come difficult decisions that will
inevitably hurt certain areas. Music, however,
should not be one of these areas.

‘ Study after study has concluded that the

beneﬁts of music education far exceed de— '

velopment of an individual’s musicianship,
alone. Music has proven to nourish the hu-
man sensory, attention, cognitive, emotional
and motor systems — all driving forces -be-
hind learning. The College Board has found
that students involved in the arts scored 63
percent higher on the verbal section and 44
percent higher on the math section of the
SAT than those with no arts participation.
In fall 2009, the College Board issuedare-
port on the matter: “The economy should not

dictate who receives the many beneﬁts that
the arts can provide. In order for the United

States to be a competitive nation that reaches‘

its ﬁlll potential, it must not permit ﬁnancial

or other barriers to prevent students from .

reaching their full potenti .”

A year later, the College Board reported
that students who took four years of arts
classes scored, on average, 91 points higher
on.the SAT than students who didn’t.

' If the company responsible for creat-
ing and administering the SAT and AP tests
insists that music education plays a role in
students’ academic success, school board
members should be quite skeptical about
quick and convenient cuts to their school’s
music curriculum. School administrators
must remember that cutting music educa-
tion cuts a student’s potential far more th
it cuts a deﬁcit. ‘ . ‘

t I Whatis more, diversiﬁed schoolcurricula

Music educationvaluableasset in school curricula

can go a long way in betteringthe lives of their

I community’s citizens. Schools should serve as

breeding grounds for their community’s fu-
ture leaders. Communities oflower socioeco-
nomic levels are in most need of the programs
so often taken away as a result ofbudget cuts.
On average, studies show that students of
lower socioeconomic backgrounds who
take music lessons in grades eight through
12 have seen a signiﬁcant increase in their
math scores compared to non-music-taking
students. Beyond improvements in matl1, mu-
sic-taking students score 40 percent higher

.in reading, history and geography. Music

students have also shown to hold higher GPAs
than non—music students in the same school.
If music education is removed from schools,
ambitious, driven and intelligent students
will have little incentive to give back to the

community that did not give to them.

And if these students aren’t enough, there
are plenty of highly successful individuals
who started intheir high school bands, choirs
and other programs: Bill Clinton played the
saxophone, Steven Spielberg played the
clarinet and Tiny Fey, Terry Bradshaw and
Norman Schwarzkopf all sang in their school
choirs. ,

These individuals all have a certain trait in

common that has undoubtedly helped them
achieve their fame: creativity. Parag Chordia,
director of the Music Intelligence Group at
the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technol-
ogy, asserts that creativity is not something
simply present in some and absent in others.
He argues that, “Creativity is something that
we all have inside of us, and what it’s all about
is ﬁnding out, how do we unlock that creativ-
ity?” Music is an eﬂicacious solution to this
problem, according to Chordia, who calls it
ﬁindamental to both life and the mind.
Providing musical opportunities to stu-

dents from their ﬁrst to last day of school is
incredibly effecﬁve in student development
and should be the goal of every school district
across the country. In atime when budget cuts
have dramatically affected fund allocations,
school administrators cannot forget that stu-
dent success, with which music education is
unequivocally correlated, should always be
a top priority.

Failure to invest in music education is a
failure to invest in students and the commu-
nity. If music and the arts are cut, as Richard
Dreyfuss put so poignantly in the 1995 ﬁlm

“Mr. Holland’s Opus,” students eventually
“aren’t going to have anything to read or write
about.”

Is this the road we, as a state and as a na-
tion, would like to take? I certainly hope not.
It is thus the responsibility of every citizen
concerned with posterity to make known
the importance of music education in our
schools. Take time this March, which is Music
in Our Schools Month, to do exactly that, not
only for today’s generation, butualso for all
generations to come.I R

‘MegaBits’ brings
monster training
to the iPhone

Stephanie Roman
For The Pitt News

“Gotta catch ’em all,” “Poke—
mon’s” most notorious phrase,
has been its theme for the past
18 years, since the days of the
original Nintendo Game Boy.
Now “MegaBits,” a South Side-
based startup, has taken that
formula and applied it to a new
console: smartphones.

The new company is devel-
oping its own monster-training
game with a modern twist. The
game is an attempt to merge the
beneﬁts of iPhone technology
with the nostalgic charm of older
8-bit games

“We wanted to take this
‘Pokemon’-on—a—smartphone
idea and really tie it in to this
new way of gaming, this kind of
location—based, real-life-focused
idea behind the game,” “Mega-
Bits” CEO Patrick Perini said.

According to Perini, the
“MegaBits” team, comprised

of ﬁve full-time members, met ’

each other in September 2012.
The group met at the ﬁrst Pitts-
burgh—based Startup Weekend,
a program through which aspir-
ing entrepreneurs team up, es-
tablish an idea and then start a
business within 54 hours.

The idea of taking a monster-
training game to smartphones
was initially pitched by Alex
Liu, “MegaBits”’ cofounder,
and the entire team soon ral-
lied behind the idea. At the end
of the competition, however, the
team faced the ﬁrst in a series of
development challenges: It lost
the competition to Thoughtful
Husband, a website designed to
help husbands pick out presents
for their wives.

Despite “Megabits”’ loss,
Perini said that Startup Weekend
strongly encouraged his team to
implement its ideas. “MegaBits”
transitioned to Kickstarter, an
online crowd-funding source
for anything from TV shows to
books and music albums.

The team set a goal of
$55,000 to develop the game.
The campaign ran fromjanuary
to February 2013, but only raised
about 25 percent of the pledge.
As a policy, Kickstarter does
not release funds if the promo-
tion fails. However, “MegaBits”
gained enough of a user base
from the fundraiser to continue
the project. They took the mo-
mentum from Kickstarter and
made another attempt at fund-
raising, this time through a local
organization called AlphaLab.

AlphaLab is a Pittsburgh-
based technological accelerator.
The program runs twice yearly,
screening applicants to provide
ofﬁce space, mentoring, training
and $25,000 tocultivate new
businesses. “MegaBits” was one
of nine companies selected by
AlphaLab in July 2013.

With some self—funding and
AlphaLab’s help, “MegaBits”
produced alpha and beta ver-
sions of the game, and as of Feb.
21, the “MegaBits” app ﬁnally
made it into customers’ hands.
Right now, 54 people are report-
ing for the closed beta, and a full
release is expected as soon as
closed and open betas complete
testing — a time which the team
estimates to be three months at
the most. '

The app’s location-focused
twist works by tracking move-

“Non-Stop” A
Directed by: Jaume Collet-
Serra ‘

Starring: Liam Neeson, Ju-
lianne Moore

Grade: C-

Liam Neeson’s newly rejuvenated career as
an action hero continues with “Non-Stop,” a
ﬁlm that once again afﬁrms his identity as an
icon of badassery, but also makes it diﬂicult
to take anything else in the ﬁlm seriously.
Though its ambition is ultimately the
ﬁlm’s undoing, here’s the plot: Internally
troubled Air Marshal Bill Marks (Neeson)
embarks on a continuous ﬂight across the
Atlantic to London. Once in the sky, Marks
begins to receive anonymous messages from
someone claiming to be aboard the plane
and threatening to kill a passenger every
20 minutes unless $150 million is wired to

Liam Neeson’s recent 0 a become
all too predictable. MCT Campus

a speciﬁed account.

What begins as a disarmingly agreeable
whodunit is slowly voided by the simple fact
that the ﬁlm doesn’t care how it ends — re-
vealing the secret villain and their murderous
motivations are irrelevant. “Non-Stop,” on
premise and Neeson alone, will put people
in seats; beyond that, the ﬁlm masks its box-
ofﬁce-sales-inspired apathy with predict-
able ridiculousness. This is one of the least
rewarding ﬁlm experiences in some time
——  teaseand no paygfﬂ

Though it is all for naught, there is ﬁm to
be had before the nonsense kicks in.lNeeson’s
talent might be once again tragically reduced

to brooding and shouting as his performance a

is diluted by-a stock role identical to so many

others in his recent more commercial ﬁlms

(such as the eerily familiar and equally disap-

. pointing ‘°Unknown”), but he is always acap; A"

tivating lead. It’s also somewhat redeeming
that the ﬁrst deaths promised by the ﬁlm’s
inconspicuous villain play out unexpectedly.
‘With these deaths, the ﬁlm promises through
its grim photography and dour tone that this
is all going somewhere interesting.

X But alas, this movie offers more than it

Liam Neeson gives us more of the san1e in ‘Non-Stop’ 

delivers, an almost unforgivable sin and a
nasty ﬂaw that eats away at your respect
for “Non-Stop.” The ﬁlm fuels its thin plot
with a ceaseless ﬂow of teases and cheap
red herrings — few extras and supporting
characters make it through the ﬁlm without
being shot as slightly suspicious — that may
at times be clever in the moment but amount
to absolutely nothing by the culmination.

If the ending was simply lazy, it would-

be a disappointing conclusion to an other-
wise decent ﬁlm, but the motivations behind
all the horror-movie-style theatrics of our
antagonist transform the serious mystery
of “Non—Stop’s” ﬁrst hour and a half into
preposterous rubbish. Not to mention the
devastatingly ham-ﬁsted political subtext
provided the clumsily devised script. The

message is jarring, unnecessary and way. .

too far from subtle to make the ﬁlm appear
intelligent.

The ﬁlm bears the aura of more com-
pelling material andstays in the air on in-
triguing ideas alone, butnot without the
steady disappointment of slowly realizing

that “Non—Stop” has no idea which direction .

it wants to go. I

Known for its surf-inspired, mellow

songs on Atlas, giving an ethereal ﬂavor
that mumbles its way through the tracks
and dominates the album. While this cre-
ates a sense of cohesiveness, it comes with
a lack of imagination that makes it hard to

distinguish what exactly you’re listening

up to a hazy sunrise and feeling entirely
unmotivated to get out of bed.'The songs

“Past Lives” provides a little varia-

those predictable Real Estate guitar riffs

also attempts to be a tad edgier with a

on the vanilla melodies of the rest of the

It starts out with the same hazy guitar

oomph to the drawling vocals that mellow
the song out.

‘The W/alkingDead’ gets a

much needed breath of life A

Jack Trainor
Stcyfj’ Wrz'ter

I’ll admit, I jumped off my couch and shout-
ed shamelessly with joy at the sight of Sgt.
Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter and—Rosita
Espinosa during the conclusion of this sea-
son’s 10th episode of “The Walking Dead.”
Rumors and speculation following the cast-
ing announcements were ﬂying around the
web, but it was a total surprise to see them
enter the show the way they did, given they
aren’t introduced in the comics until a little
further down the road.

Now, after a ﬁill episode, we still don’t
know very much about Eugene and Rosita,
who said about ﬁve combined words in the
entire 45 minutes. But we do know a fair
amount about Abraham — both his origin
and the refreshing humor that “Southland’s”
Michael Cudlitz brings to the character.
While we know less about the others, it’s
apparent that the folks in charge of “The
Walking Dead” are using these characters
to breathe new life into a show that’s been
running a little bland and predictable since
its climactic midseason ﬁnale.

As far as ﬁrst impressions go, Cudlitz
nailed it. His ease with the role no doubt
comes from his experience on “Southland,”

Josh McDermitt’s take an Eugene Porter is strange, sneaky and manipulative.

giggles while he does it.

in which he starred as Ofﬁcerjohn Cooper.
But he doesn’t bring all the seriousness of a
dedicated police oﬂicer to Abraham’s char-
acter, which is wise.

Instead he’s a man that is ﬁilly embracing
his situation, relishing each zombie kill as he
mocks and toys with them before shoving
a crowbar into their fragile skulls —— and

Cudlitz even actually grew out the iconic
handlebar mustache, which takes dedica-
tion. -

The only moment that felt out of char-
acter for the gung-ho Abraham was not re-
taliating in the slightest when Eugene calmly

threatens  by telling the sergeant that‘
. he is smarter than him. For as dedicated as

Abraham is to hisvoluntary mission, which
is delivering Eugene to Washington, D.C.,

he’s still the prideful undisputed leader of

his group. .

Josh McDermitt’s portrayal of the awk-
ward Eugene Porter was also well done, but
overshadowed by Cudlitz’s performance.
Obviously, we’re supposed to know next to
nothing about the shy scientist, who is sup-
posedly in communication with someone in

ment through the iPhone’s GPS, which
essentially turns the real world into the
game’s landscape in real time. On the game
screen, wild monsters (called MegaBits)
appear that can be battled and captured.
Similarly, the avatar of any other trainer
with the app shows up in the vicinity. In
the game’s ﬁrst generation, 37 unique
monsters will be available, but as the app
globalizes and spreads outside the United
States, even more monsters will be dis-
coverable. ~ .

The experience constantly changes. Dif-
ferent MegaBits appear in the ﬁeld depend-
ing on the time of day and the weather.
Also, some monsters only appear in certain
cities, opening up trade possibilities across
the country. i .

According to “MegaBits” Marketing
Lead Chris Banks, “MegaBits” will be free-
to—play and aims to make money byselling
in—game items that will make gameplay
easier.

“If you want to play the game any faster
than it’s set up, then you’re going to have to
buy something,” Banks said. This includes
clothing and hats to individualize each
trainer’s avatar. But not every transaction
needs to involve real money.

“You earn money as you go, in-game,
through battling,” Banks said.

Perini said the group chose the iPhone

’ platform because “it’s a device [they] all

just had,” but he said that he believes the
game’s iPhone accessibility will be key to
making the game proﬁtable.

“I want to be able to play a game like’

‘Pokemon,’ but I don’t want to have to go
out and buy a $250 [Nintendo] 3DS and
carry that around. Why not put it on the
plggform I’-ve.got?” hesaid. T

 Still in development, the closed beta
intends to compile user suggestions and
bug reports. Though there is no official
release date set, Banks said the game will

be made open to the public once major
problems  such as issues with player
interactions — have been addressed dur-
ing beta testing.

The “MegaBits” team has a hectic fu-

ture ahead, including ﬁxing bugs, releasing

the full game, revealing new monsters,
adding Tamagotchi- and Neopets-style

carekeeping, adding minigames, hosting a‘

launch party and showcasing the product

at the Game Developers_Conference in San
Francisco March 17-21. ;

When “MegaBits” hits theapp store,

Perini hopes it will be instantaneously
recognizable as a game in the vein of 8-bit
“Pokemon,” with the same capture, trade,
battle and training core mechanics.

The “MegaBits” team isn’t the only one
excited about the concept. Pitt junior Alex
Just expressed excitement at the game’s
possibilities.

“It deﬁnitely interests me. Instead of R
. spending hours searching, training, breed-’

ing and whatnot, it would be more about
the combat, speciﬁcally with real—life play-
ers,” he said. I * ~ I

Washington, D.C., and who (suspiciously)
won’t let anyone else monitor the phone.
What we do know about Porter is that
he is intimidated by Abraham, but has a ﬁ-
ery side. After hitting the gasoline tank of
their truck while spraying down a cluster
of zombies, he calmly threatens Abraham
instead of apologizing, despite an inability
to defend himself. , _
Eugene is quiet and odd, but manipula-
tive, which seems to be his only advantage
in this new world; it’ll be interesting to see
what’s in store for him now that they are
without the safety of their armored truck.
Then there’s Rosita, played by Christian’

Serratos. While Serratos’ character goes ‘

highly underused in the comics, I’ll bet that
the writers forthe show will take some lib-
erties with her character as they did with
the Governor last season. She," too, seems
timid, but is armed with dual pistols and a
permanently sassy expression that suggests
she is deadly.

While their future is far from certain, it’s i

nice to see the show embracing these three
mainstays of the comic series. H _

deed, it provides good background music
to a spring evening of driving with the car
windows down at sunset. It is solid, com-
fortable music and anyone who is a pro-
claimed indie—music lover will probably
rest easy in the no-frills lyrics and7cool
tunes. While it’s not a genre-shattering
opus, it’s certainly pleasant.

As Courtney appropriately lulls in “Past
Lives”: “It still has that same old sound.”

Rebounding Woes spell doom for Pitt in home loss

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

N.C. State guard T.]. Warren set a Pe-

tersen Events Center record with his » I

41 points Monday night. But as im-
pressive as the ACC’s leading scorer
was, ‘he wasn’t the only reason Pitt lost
its third-straight home contest when
North Carolina State beat the Panthers
at their own game. .

While Warren was scoring at will, the
rest of the Wolfpack were dominating
the Panthers on the glass. Pitt (22-8,
10-7 ACC) ﬁnished on the wrong end
of a 35-23 rebounding margin, and the
Panthers ultimately lost 74-67 in their
final home game of the season.

With one game remaining for his
team in the regular season on Saturday
at Clemson, head coach Jamie Dixon
maintained that rebounding is the com-
mon theme in all eight of his team’s
losses.

“When we’ve come up short, that’s
always been the thing that stands out
to me,” Dixon said.

And opposite Warren’s record-set-
ting night, the Panthers tied one of their
own —— Pitt’s 23 rebounds tie for the
lowest single-game total by a Dixon-
coached team, after Pitt recorded only
23 rebounds in a victory against George-
town Jan. 13, 2007.

The rebounding total —— especially
on the offensive glass — left Pitt’s head
coach stunned.

“I don’t know how we can get two
offensive rebounds,” Dixon said.

North Carolina State head coach
Mark Gottfried echoed Dixon’s senti-
ments, calling Pitt’s offensive rebound-
ing totals “almost unheard of” with a
Dixon-coached unit.

Dixon’s disbelief in Pitt’s rebound-
ing numbers is supported by the record
books — Pitt’s total of two offensive
rebounds set a school-record for the
lowest single-game total.

N.C. State’s rebounding helped to
compensate for the Panthers’ superior
shooting Monday, similar to the way
Pitt found a way to defeat Notre Dame

’Saturday despite the Fighting Irish out-

shooting them for most of the game.
Senior center Talib Zanna said Pitt’s

use of a zone defense contributed to the
Wolfpack (18-12, 8-9 ACC) reeling in 13
offensive rebounds.

“It’s easy to get a rebound [against
a] zone,” Zanna said. “We just didn’t

against a team that prides itself on defending
the way Pitt does.”
Although Dixon wanted Pitt to delay Warren
from ever getting into his rhythm, he made it
clear early that he couldn’t be stopped —— even
as N.C. State’s only scoring option.

“We couldn’t have talked about him more

if and him being the guy, but yet early on it
I seemed like we didn’t know he was a 24-point-

a-game guy,” Dixon said. “I was just surprised
that we could not understand that this was
the guy who was going to score.”

Through the ﬁrst 14:40, Warren had 15
of his team’s 31 points. -

“I came out pretty aggressive and my
teammates did a pretty good job of ﬁnding
me throughout the ﬂoor, executing the of-
fense,” he said.

Moreover, he was just minutes removed
from executing the play that set him off.

With more than nine minutes left in the

S ﬁrst half and Pitt ahead 22-17, Jamel Artis

found himself falling out of bounds with the
ball in his hands near the right corner and the
shot clock about to expire. Artis pushed hard
off his legs and sank a 3—pointer to beat the
buzzer and build Pitt’s momentum.

Unfortunately, Warren’s scoring storm
began to brew shortly after when he hit an
even more difﬁcult fadeaway jumper. Warren
even had a hand in his face.

Asked if he knew it was going to be his
night after that shot, Warren, who kept a
stoic face despite just setting multiple re-
cords, ﬁnally laughed. “Yeah,” he said, “it
felt pretty good.”

Falling shots, contested shots, layups,

dunks, putbacks. It was all falling for War-
ren, and Lamar Patterson, who was pegged
with the task of trying to halt him, said he
felt that way.

“Every shotwas going in,” Patterson said.
“He shot over us and got easy looks, but once
you make so many layups, its easy to put the
ball in the net.”

Warren used his wiry and muscular frame
to carve through the defense on his way to
layups, but he also took advantage of his

block out. We didn’t do the right things.
I guess that’s what we get.”
Pitt ﬁnished at an even 50 percent

from the ﬁeld for the second consecu-1

tive game. The Panthers shot out to an
early double—digit lead, which peaked at
13 points late in the first half, shooting
59.1 percent on 13 of 22 field goals in
the game’s first 20 minutes.

But even with a 36-31 halftime lead,

Dixon wasn’t comfortable.

“We were making shots, but we
weren’t out-rebounding them, and we
knew that,” Dixon said. “Eventually that
stuff catches up to you.”

He was right.

Pitt’s hot shooting cooled consider-
ably in the second half, when the Pan-
thers scored just 31 points on eight ﬁeld
goals in the second half. Gottfried said
there wasn’t a difference in his team’s
defensive strategy from one half to the
next, but that the Wolfpack just got bet-

ter in the second half.

That strategy focused on Pitt’s own
perimeter scoring threat: forward La-
mar Patterson.

“We tried to full-front Patterson, just
completely deny him the ball,” Gott-
fried said. “We did a‘imuch better job
of helping each other?’ '

As a result of the defensiveeffort,

" especially on the interior, N.C. State

weldid a couple of nights ago, and I

1 think that helped us get in better po-

said.

With the loss, the Panthers finished
their home schedule with a 4-5 record
in conference play. Pitt’s loss came in

the final home game for seniors Zanna
 and Patterson. ii _,  1

to keep tabs. _ 3

“Generally you would like him" to take
some shots that he took,” Dixon said. “But
the biggest thing was the fouls he got on guys.
Fouls away from the ball to start the game
took away from the aggressiveness we could
have had. And that’s part of being a great
offensive player, too.”

That agility put the Panthers in a tough

’ spot,» as perimeter defenders guarding War-

ren picked up cheap fouls off the ball.

“The foul trouble was limiting us,”. Dixon
said. “We didn’t have many options to put on
Warren at that time. When we were man, we
double—teamed him. We haven’t used that a
lot, often, but we did practice it in both games
prior to playing them.” — '

But even before Warren drew fouls that
stymied Pitt’s defensive options, even before
he hit the fadeaway jumper, even before he

. swiped the ball on defense and ﬁnished the
' play with a two—handed ﬂush, Warren was

feeling it.

At the end of the teams’ ﬁrst pregame
shoot—arounds, which usually happen with
an hour before the game and last about 15
minutes, players take ﬁnal.shots until they
make one, then walk back to the locker room.

James Robinson and Mike Youngwere the
last two on the court, misﬁring from 3-point
range. It took Robinson about six tries before
ﬁnally ﬁnding his stroke. But after every Pan-
ther had headed for the locker room, N.C.
State trailed them. '

In game speed, Warren crossed half
court, took two long dribbles to the top of the
3-point arc, and sank the jumperin one try.
