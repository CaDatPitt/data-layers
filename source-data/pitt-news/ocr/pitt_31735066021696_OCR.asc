Bomb scare clears
two Pitt buildings

By Jill Carell

Assistant News Editor

The Learning Research and De-
velopment Center and the School
of Library and Information
Science building both received
bomb threats yesterday morning.

At approximately 9:27 a.m.,
Connie Fabrizio, asecretary in
the LRDC, received a call warn-
ing her that a bomb would go off
in the LRDC in 20 minutes.

At approximately 9:30 a.m.,

Joyce Seifert, admissions secre--

tary in the SLIS building, received
a similar call. .
According to Seifert the caller
said, ”I have something very im-
portant that I want to tell you, I

want you to listen very carefully. ‘

There will be a serious explosion
in your building — a bomb will
go off in 20 minutes — this is not
a hoax.” The caller then hung up.

Both Fabrizio and Seifert be-
lieved the voice to be that of a

woman in her thirties..She was -

also said to have a Middle Eastern
accent. .

The LRDC was immediately
evacuated. The University of
Pittsburgh Policealong with the
City of Pittsburgh's Special Oper-
ations Division searched the
building, whereupon they found
no bomb.

An unidentified person pulled
the fire alarm in the SLIS build-
ing to evacuate it. The Pittsburgh
Fire Department, Pittsburgh
Police and university police
responded immediately. Again,
no bomb was found.

”We thoroughly went through
the building and people were out
within 15 minutes; there was no
panic at all,” said John Aug,
director of Administrative Serv-

Justice was motivation behind Dwyer suicide

By David Morris

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG, Pa, — Pennsyl-
vania’s treasurer, facing jail for
defrauding the state, proclaimed
his innocence at a news confer-
ence Thursday but said ”|t’s too
late for me,” then pulled a pistol

from a manila envelope, put it.

into his mouth and killed himself.

R. Budd Dwyer died instantly

after he fired a single shot from
a .357 Magnum pistol in front of
two dozen horrified reporters,
photographers and aides, said
Dauphin County Coroner .Wil-
liam Bush.
- ”No, No! Budd, don't do this!”
screamed several people who
had gathered in‘Dwyer’s office
suite in the state Finance Build-
ing just before he pulled the
trigger. _

Moments after the shotirang
out, someone cried, ”Dear God
in heaven.”

Dwyer’s son Rob, 21,’ said his
father had given the family no in-
dication of what he intended to
do. ‘

”We’re pretty broken up,” he
said, his voicebreaking during a
telephone interview. He said he
heard the news at home with his
mother, Joanne, 47, and sister,
Dyan, 18. ' ‘

On Wednesday, the attorney

‘ general’s office had declared that

Dwyer, 47, would be out of
office as: soon as he was sen-
tenced Friday in federal court in
Williamsport.‘ Prior to that,
Dwyer, a Republican who had

been elected to his second term
in 1984, had planned to stay in

office on a leave of absence

without pay until his appeal was

‘resolved.

A jury in December convicted
Dwyer of awarding a $4.6 mil-
lion contract to a firm called
Computer Technology Associates
in return for a promised
$300,000 payoff. No money ever
changed hands. ~

He faced up to'55 years in pri-
son for five counts of mail fraud,

' four counts of interstate transpor-

tation in aid of racketeering, one
count of perjury and one count
of conspiracy to commit bribery.

At the news conference, Dwyer
read a rambling, half—hour state-

. ment in which he’ said he was a

victim of the legal system.

, He held up his hands when he‘

saw some television cameramen
start taking down their equipment
and told them: ”You don't want
to take down your equipment
yet.”

A short time later, he reached
into the large envelope, telling
those people nearby, ”Stay aw-ay,
this thing will hurt someone.”

Fred Cusick, a reporter for The
Philadelphia Inquirer, was in the
front row at the time of the
shooting.

”I should have run and
grabbed him when he pulled out
the envelope,” Cusick said. ”I
knew that was it.” . I ’

Just before he pulled the gun,
Dwyer called acting treasurer
Donald L. Johnson and two other
aides to his side. He handed each
of them sealed envelopes that he
said contained instructions for
them to read later.

Bush, the coroner, said there
will be an investigation.by his
office and state police to deter-
mine if anyone knew in advance‘
of Dwyer’s plans.

One of the envelopes, was.

given to Greg Penny, a spokes-

Pentagon presses for extradition of hijacker

WASHINGTON — American
military bases around the world
have been advised by the
Defense Intelligence Agency to

.move to a heightened state of

alert against terrorist attack, the
Pentagon said Wednesday.

The order, disseminated on Jan.
17, is tied to the arrest in West
Germany of a‘ Lebanese man sus-
pected of participating in the
1985 hijacking of TWA Flight
847 from Rome to Athens, said
one Pentagon official who asked
not to be named.

The hijackers killed U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem at Beirut air-
port and held 39 American pas-
sengers hostage for 17 days. The

United States is now pressing

West Germany to extradite the
man for trial here.

The source said, ”The assump-
tion here is that there could be a
terrorist response against the
United States, particularly if this
man is transported from Germa-
ny to Washington."

”The order just advises every- .

body to increase surveillance and

Wisconsin ’s Aspin
re-elected chairman

WASHINGTON — Rep. Les
Aspin was re-elected chairman of
the House Armed Services Com-
mittee Thursday, reversing an
earlier defeat and ending two
weeks of campaigning for the top
job by four Democrats on the
panel which oversees the
Pentagon.

The Wisconsin Democrat won
a 133-1 16 victory over Rep. Mar-
vin Leath of Texas in the last of
a series of votes by House
Democrats. In earlier balloting,
Reps. Nicholas Mavroulesl of
Mass. and Charles Bennettrof Fla.
were eliminated.

The 258 Democrats pick com-
mittee chairmen, one of the rights
of the party which holds the
majority in the 435-member
House. Republicans do ‘not vote
in the elections.

continued from page 1
stated.

”Last May, I told you that after '

the trial, I would give you the sto-
ry of the decade. To those of you
who are shallow, the events of
this morning will be that story.
But to those of you with depth
and concern, the real story will
be what I hope and pray results
from this morning — in the com-

ing months and years, the de-.

velopment of a true justice
system here in_the United States.

”I am going to die in office in
an effort to ’,.., see if the shame-
ful facts, spread out in all their
shame, will not burn through our
civic shamelessness and set fire
to American pride,’ " it said,
quoting turn-of-the-century jour-
nalist Lincoln Steffens’ book,
”The Shame of the Cities.”

”  Joanne, Rob, Dee Dee —.
I love you! Thank you for making
my life so happy," it said. ”Good
bye to all of you on the count of
3. Please make sure that the
sacrifice of my life is not in vain.”

About 1 p.m., -a letter from
Dwyer to Gov. Robert P. Casey
was hand-delivered by Dwyer’s
lawyer, Paul Killion, to Casey's
general counsel, Morey Myers.

”By the time you receive this
letter, the office of state treasurer
of Pennsylvania willbe vacant,”
the letter "said. ”I stress to you that
I did not resign but was state
treasurer of Pennsylvania to the
end." ’

In the letter, he asked Casey to
consider naming his wife, Joanne,
to fill the vacancy.

Casey spokesman Robert
Grotevant said the governor

would not appoint Mrs. Dwyer.
He said, Casey would act soon to
fill the position but said he did
not have a timetable for the de-
cision. .

When Dwyer pulled the gun
from the envelope, two reporters
near the back of the room ran
into the hallwayand yelled for
police. ,

”Get a cop, he's got a gun,”
yelled Stephen Drachler, a report-
er for the Morning Call in Al-
lentown.

Immediately after the shooting
the office was sealed off to every-
one except medical and police
personnel.

Art Straub, executive director of
Harrisburg River Rescue, said one
of his units was sent to the scene

, on first report of a shooting. He
said there was no hope for Dwyer
by thetime the unit arrived.

”The injury was severe enough
that there was no point in at-
tempting resuscitation,” Straub
said. ”The gun was placed in the

mouth. There was an exit wound ’

in the back of the head, a portion
of the back of the head was
missing.” '

Almost instantly, treasury
department employees on the
first floor of the finance building
gathered in shock in the hallway,
some of them embracing and
sobbing. ’

Within 30 minutes, police be-I

gan questioning reporters and
others who were in the room to
determine ——exactly' what
happened. ,

In his statement, Dwyer criti-
cized the media, acting U.S.
Attorney James West, who

prosecuted his case,.former Gov.
Dick Thornburgh and senior U.S.
District Judge Malcolm Muir.

Dwyer said the judge had a his-
tory of imposing ”medieval sen-
tences." He also said he was
”being punished for a crime I did
not commit.”

West called the shooting ”a
tragedy,” but said he stands by
the government's case and the ju-
ry’s verdict.

’’I don't know all the facts of
what he said, and this isn't the
time to comment,” West said. ”It
is a tragedy.”

Muir could not be reached for
comment.

Dwyer, red-faced and sweating
as he spoke, also urged repeal of
the death penalty. He said that

what happened to him made him ‘

sure innocent people have been
convicted and executed.

He also apologized for voting
several times as a legislator, in
favor of the death penalty.

Casey, who succeeded Thorn-
burgh this week, said in.a state-
ment that he and his wife ”are

‘profoundly shocked and sad-

dened. Mrs. Dwyer and her chil-
dren are in our prayers.” \

When he pulled the pistol
out, everybody started yelling,

I was standing on a chair be-

Nothing went through my

Dwyer brought the pistol

Celebration has

been prostituted

~ In a university with the size and national prestige of'Pitt, new

‘ funding is a constant need. There is -always a demand for money

to conti.nue research, to’ hire new faculty and to upgrade the
facilities. This year is no exception. V

This year, however, is different in one glaring respect. This
year is the University of.Pittsburgh’s bicentennial. Two-hundred
years of service. Two-hundred years of excellence. Two-h und red

years of fund-raising.

In a story printed in'Wednesday’s issue, an official from the

I Bicentennial Commission‘ was quoted as having said that the

mai-n objective of the celebration was to ”serve as a launching

V’ platform for huge contributions being solicited from all over

the country.” There seems to be something inherently wrong
with raising money by prostituting the reputation of our school.

There were references in the article to the recognition that
would fall on donors this year because of the amount of pub-
licity being generated by the celebration. In essence, the univer-

 sity seems to be asking for money onthe grounds that the donors

wil|'be publicly recognized for their gifts.
It is hard to imagine any philanthropist having fame as their

C motivation to give. Pitt should not promote itself as a press agent
’ for the wealthy. Rather, the donations we receive should reflect

each donor's respect for our institution, not the desire to see
onefs name glowing in the light of celebration.
Pitt would do well -to solicit contributions accordingly.

Inaugural address

lacks sincerity  

lOn Tuesday of this week, Bob Casey was-inaugurated as the

new governor of Pennsylvania. As tradition demands of newly

elected officials, Mr. Casey gave an inaugural address. An in-
spiring, piece of rhetoric, to be sure,’but one that bade poorly
of any hope for. fresh initiative on the part of the state govern-

. ment. In short, the applicable word was rehash. Maybe corned

beef hash, for all the relevance it had to the current problems.
Below are some quotes indicative of the content of Mr.

Casey's address. a j

- ”Our standard of |ife,depends on our quality of life.”

”We must- bank the fires of political strife.” Not extinguish,

understand, but bank. .
”Our system must provide judges who are competent and

‘fair, hard-working and incorruptible.” Mr. Casey certainly shows
‘a refreshing and bold initiative. Who would have thought of

fair, competent judges? V

in the illustrious history of our country, there have been in-
novation,‘free thought and brilliance among our leaders. Mr.
Casey seems fond of pointing these leaders out to us, telling

This year, we observe the 19th
anniversary of Martin Luther
King's death. With sober eyes, we
can look around us, trying to see
what the sacrifice of such a great
man has brought.

At the time of his death, racial

discrimination was not only toler-
ated among large portions of our
society, it was encouraged. The
young were taught to deafen their
ears to the cries of the oppressed

and close their eyes to the in-

justice around them.

Sadly, we cannot, even 20
years later, claim victory._ We
cannot say that we live in a land
in which all are equal, even in the
eyes of the law. We can do noth-
ing but hope and work for a fu-
ture that will speak better of
America than our past.

”Don’t judge us on our color,
judge us on the content of our
character.” _ '

This quote perhaps most clear-
ly embodies the philosophy ad-
vocated by Dr. King. Perhaps it
is the best aphorism for any per-
son, regardless of race, to live by.
King died for it, like so many ‘be-
fore him.

It is not out of respect for the
deadthat we should work for
equality. We are not trying to
redeem an assasination by striv-
ing to become a more integrated
society. It is a simple point of
justice. L

words ”We hold these truths to

Look around you. Look at the

It's long past time for us to turn

that turn us to beasts, killing each

Conjoined twin in
critical condition

By Lee Linder
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— A
3-week-old conjoined twin
boy was in critical condition
Thursday, and the chief sur-
geon said he may not survive
after an eight hour intricate
separation operation during
which his weaker brother
died.

The boys had shared a heart,
liver and intestines.

”Surgery went as well as
‘could be expected and it is
very questionable as to
whether he [Baby B] will sur-
vive,” said Dr. James O'Neill,
chief of surgery at Children's
Hospital. ‘

The surviving infant was
moved to intensive care where
he will be monitored around-

. the—clock.

”He is considered in ex— .

tremely critical condition,”
said O’Neill. ’’It will be touch
and go for at least the next
eight hours.”

O'Neill made no other state-
ment. A news conference may
be held Friday. '

Patricia Usner, a hospital
spokeswoman, said any num-
ber of complications could oc-
cur, such as major bleeding

and heart arrest. ”He will be
closely watched,” she said.

Surgery to separate the
twins, joined from breastbone
to abdomen and together
weighing'7 pounds, began at
8:20 a.m. yesterday, nearly
two hours after they were
wheeled into the operating
room. it was completed at 4
p.m.

Ms. Unser said ”Baby A”,
separated from his brother at
2.30 p.m., was clinically dead
at noon, less than four hours
after the operation began. He
was kept attached to his
brother while surgeons moved
the heart and liver into the
proper places in ”Baby B’s”
body.

Originally the hospital
reported ”Baby A” had not
died until separated.

”To separate the children
one had to be sacrificed, but
without the surgery neither in-
fant could have survived much
longer,” said Unser.

, ’’It was‘ a very sad and
difficult decision, and the only
way we were able to justify it
was knowing in our own

— minds that at least you have a

chance to save one. Other-
wise, you would definitely
lose both. Everyone agreed
this was the only way to go.”

ROTC senior wins Marticelli

Foundation scholarship award I

By Robin‘ Winicour
For The Pitt News

”She leaves as a soldier and
returns as a nurse,” Rick James
said of his roommate’s schedule.

Kim Smith, a senior’ nursing
major, was recently granted the
Marchitelli Foundation scholar-
ship award for ability in the field
of nursing. She was the number
one nurse at Camp Perry in Ohio,
where she received her ROTC
training, outperforming cadettes
in 17 states. She has received 21
ROTC awards, four of them na-
tional, in such diverse areas as
marksmanship, field navigation,
leadership and academics. And
with all that metal pinned to her
army greens, she was named
Cadette Battalion Commander of
all Rotc students at Pitt.

Only the strong can weather

' the ROTC under Smith's com-

mand. That means mentally as
well as phsically. As a leader, she
expects as much from her
cadettes as she does from herself.

There have been cases where

cadettes quit the corps because

they didn't think they could
measure up to her expectations.

in a field traditionally dominat-
ed by men, Smith has had to face
derogatory comments from her
male peers. J

Smith's reply to those critics
was ’’You may not agree with the
decision of my command, but
that's the way it is.”

She explained her feelings,
”When‘ put in a position of high‘
command, there is always going
to be someone you have to prove
yourself to .— whether you're
male or female.” '

Smith decided on her future
plans last summer when she

spent a month working as a nurse
in a service hospital in Nurem-
berg, Germany.
’’I want to fulfill the eight years
I owe to the army in Germany,
Japan or Korea,” she said. ”By ex-
amining other cultures, you're
able to better understand your
own.”
_ Smith said she recognizes her
limitations. '
’’I’m not perfect. I never pre-

Lt. Col. Kinchoffner and Kim Smith.

 

tend to be,” she said. ’’If I want
something, I'll work for it. But I'll
also go out and get drunk or skip
a class — just like anybody else.”
Originally from Meadville,
Smith resides in an Oakland

-apartment with seniors Rick

James and Don Martin.

”We're good friends,” Smith
said. ”We joke around, we have
lots of pillowfights.”

Apartment search a challengefor Pitt students

By John Duffy
and David Cohen

For The Pitt News
A lottery is a game of chance.

Pitt houses 4,172 students out
of an aproximate total enrollment
of 29,000. These lucky few are
selected not by class rank, or dis-
tance from home but by the num-
ber they pull from a bin.

This leaves the remaining
24,928 students two choices:

‘-commuting from their parents

homes, or finding an apartment
off campus. . I

Centrally located, Pitt is not a
long drive for r?l’ost commuters,
nor a long walk for students liv-
ing in off-campus housing.

M. Shandu, a junior living in
Tower C, said, ’’I like the con-
venience of being close to every-
thing and getting to meet a lot of
people.” However, he was quick
to point out, ”The noise, the
difficulty of studying in your
room, and a community

vantages.”

Carl Zelinka, a senior living in
a Shadyside apartment, said that
he enjoys ”the privacy of having
your own apartment.‘ It means
more freedom and more living
space.” Zelinka added/’This also
means the further you are from
campus, the longer the walk to

Rich Jingling, a commuter,
said, ” I like living at home,
_ which is a more familiar area. But
the traffic, bad drivers on the
roads, hassles [of finding] a park-
ing place and paying are the dis-
advantages.”

The most common method of
finding an apartment is to look in
the classified sections of
newspapers for vacancies. People
also find their apartments by sim-
ply walking or driving around
searching for ”For Rent” signs.

first floor of the William Pitt Un-
ion, the OCHS contains almost
everything students need to start

' their search.

The office is staffed with assis-
tants to aid students, and stocked
with brochures, maps and
descriptions of available apart-
ments. The descriptions include
such information as: rent, securi-
ty deposit, location, features, in-

clusions and whom to contact. "

With a valid student ID, the
OCHS offers free use of a
metropolitan phone service.

Dan Radznakowski, a recep-
tionist at OCHS, said, ”We’re
here to help’ the students, and
more people should take advan-
tage of the service.”

Once a student has gathered a
list of promising apartments, it is
his responsibility to go. out and
visit the apartments personally.
OCHS does not offer biased sug-
gestions for a student, but they do
offer a file that details any com-
plaints by previous tenants.

One major decision students
often have to make is whether to
live in south. or north Oakland.
South Oakland offers the maxi-
mum number of apartments with
major rental agencies such as

Academic Realty and Daran‘

Management Co. South Oakland
is populated mostly by students,
who describe the atmosphere as
very social.

Street parking is available with
a permit. The walking distance to
campus is relatively short. The
campus bus service also runs
through much of the area.

_The average rent for a two

bedroom apartment falls into the
_$400—$500 per month range.

Most landords require that the
tenant pay the utility bills.

I .

North Oakland, with a smaller
student population, has fewer
apartments to offer.

Justine Saunders, assistant
manager of Amberson Plaza
Apartments in north Oakland,

said, ”Amberson has strived to
accomodate college students by
providing comfortable, low-rent

" apartments. I like renting to stu-

dents but try to be selective in my
choices. At the present, the stu-
dents I have in this building have
proven to be courteous [and] con-
siderate.”

A one bedroom apartment in
Amberson Plaza Apartments runs
between $420-$450 and a two
bedroom apartment between
$520-$530 (plus electric) per
month. Amberson Plaza also

offers a swimming pool, two
French restaurants and a 7-Eleven ,

store at its entrance. _

Most of the buildings in north-
Oakland are large and sometimes
very modern, but require a 15-45
minute walk from campus. This
is complicated by the fact that the

campus bus does not travel very‘

far into the area. The rent for
these apartments usually runs
from $500-$600, but parking for
one car is often included.

A complex perlormer cries out against intection of The soul
at a Time when The inability To be loved is commonplace

By Douglas ,W. Payne

First, a note of discourse. The
The is The face a Talented young
lad named Matt Johnson dons
which, like The Golden Palimi—
nos, also serves as a moniker for
an ever-changing aggregate of
obscure musicians. Under such a
guise, Johnson remains con-
stantly self-etfacing, if not some-
what unaccountable for his
almost visionary, apocalyptic
work in The The. IT is perhaps not
merely a coincidence that The
The allows Johnson a harbor, or
hiding place, to, . without
reserve, express his deepest
desires and darkest emotions.
Yet, unabashedly he does This
from The Thin line between envi-
sioned maturity and engendered
fragility. Without regret, he is
The innocence festered in corrup-
tion and The anger among The
hopeless. He is a poet who can
create from The soul.

Burning B/ue 5ou/ debuted un-

der his given name in l98l and
didn't stir more Than a mere nod
from posT—punkers. A neo-
psychedelic journey Through
neurosis, childlike fear and a sort
of aggravated sexuality, Burning
B/ue Soul was a Tortuous ex-
perience (to live and witness) of
acerbic wit and vengeful empti-
ness. lt was, admittedly, quite
difficult to bear listening to. The
avanT—garde, three-chord rock
elicited utter pain, and The beat-
like poetry was delivered in
primal-scream tones.

Sou/ Mining, released in The

UK.‘ late in l983, was The first

album to bear The The The stamp
on'the sleeve. The album, while
further delving into The depths of
The soul, was a more cohesive,
listenable effort and, to This day,
remains an unqualified master-
piece of The '80s. Johnson fur—
Ther expanded his psychedelia
into soul (not a Stax or lvlotown
imitation, but absolutely per-
sonal and sincere white soul)

and turned his obscuritiesrinto
vulnerability and sensitivity. Brit-
ish hits such as "Uncertain
Smile" (which benefits from a
swing-style piano solo by Jools
Holland of Squeeze), ”This is
The Day” and ”Perfect” (of
which The superior of four remix—
es appears only on The Ameri-
can copy of The album) proved
The perfection of The chemistry.
The consistent panoply of emo-
tions on Soul /\/lining is stark and
volatile, and The sensation is
celebratory, if not sonically dark
and haunting. ‘

/nfected is certainly a logical
step forward as it broadens
Johnson's once introvertedly
visual scope To social concerns
and Faustian concerns of the
corporate machine. Perhaps it is
unfair to expect an equal work
of brilliance on the clearly un-
satisfying /nfected in the wake of
something as substantial as Soul
/\/lining. The new album is cer-
tainly no less noteworthy for its

A complex scheme of themes, but, »

in the end, it is merely average.

Infected seems to be address-
ing an age where the great
compulsion for love and the
desire to be close is Thwarted by
AlDS and other life-threatening
diseases. Although Johnson
claims that this is The case, Infect-

ed, which is receiving a great‘

deal of American airplay, seems
to me to be a painfully lonesome
cry for love where the inability
to be loved remains supreme.
Out or’ the Blue, however,
presents the absolute antithesis
of this by expressing Johnson's

own inability To love when he _
sings: / was trying so hard to

please myse/f, / was turning into
somebody e/se. * '
He sings of the fall of Mother
Britain in "Angels of Deception"
and of the overglorification of
American rot in the British hit

American elitism at ”Born in the
USA"). Johnson is clearly
emerging from his introversion
with a fierce style, but the true
point of Infected, and its ultimate
strength, lies in songs such as

”The Mercy Beat” and‘

”Twilight of a Champion.” The
former boasts of a Western guy
who attempts to regain his soul
after he's sold it to the devil in
a bar, while the latter portrays

7 an omega man who's smiling

through his teeth and who
would rather kill off his agony
than succumb to the disease of
social charms which jeopardize
his morality.

Infected is filled with contami-
nation, disease, corruption of

3 character, amorality, inhumani-

ty and illustrations of how the
world unjustly corrupts what lit-
tle innocence remains. It is very
much like an internal modonna-
whore complex in which man is
lead into temptation by his own
deep, dark desires, yet he de-
tests the corruption of his own
soul. As an ardent The The fan,

may not. What gave Soul Min-
ing a distinctive, original unity
was its ability to emotionally
convey its personal politics
through the percussive keyboard
arrangements; hence, not a
new-wave or punk conglomera-

tion, but a rock-’n’—rall album in.
- which the musical ostinati spoke

with the words. Johnson has
again succeeded with this very
personal approach to his music,
yet there's less hooks to grab a
hold of on Infected. Never any
less than absolutely sincere, In-
fected is still far more esoteric
than its lively predecessor.

Finally, Infected has a gnaw-
ing tendency to become silly
and, sometimes, pretentious.
This is especially evident on filler
songs like "Slow Train to Dawn"
and "Sweet Bird of Truth" (both
sound like Tennessee Williams
parodies). However, that should
not detract from the aural plea-
sure one can derive from this fas-
cinating album. lf Matt Johnson
doesn't entirely give up hope on
humanity altogether, which is
possible, he could remain the
most consistently fascinating mu-
sician af the '80s.

Giants will rollover Denver at Pasadena

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

_Placed your bets on Super
Bowl XXI yet? How many of you
took the Giants, with their won-
derful linebackers and the
redoubtable Joe Morris? Or was
your cash laid on Denver's Bron-
cos, a gutsy group led by a Win-
chester rifle named John Elway?

Tough decision, huh?

Well, in considering what these
two teams are made of and
reflecting on the Stupor Bowls of
‘years past, it's not as tedious as
it seems. On paper, these teams
appear evenly matched, except

for the bookie’s point spread that
favors the Giants by nine. But
let's forget about the Vegas lines
and look into the record books of
past games_.

Dateline: 1983. It's the strike
year, and two apparently solid
teams, Washington and Miami,
have breezed through the Super
Bowl Tournament into the final
game. The ’'Killer Bees”. versus
the ”Hogs” and the "'Fun
Bunch.” Miami's defense was
ranked No. 1.but hadn't played
a real offensive power all half sea-
son long. A case of overrating

Don Shula’s pastel media dolls,.

as the Redskins prevailed 27-17.

ANALYSIS

People forget that Washington
had a pretty good defense, too,
that year, and the Dolphins’ quar-
terback David Woodley was only
a part-time starter for Don Shula.
He got rattled, and the ex-
perienced Joe Theismann didn't.

Dateline: 1984. Again, the
Skins make it to the Super Bowl,
blowing through the playoffs with
a vengance. But the Raiders are
waiting for them in Tampa, with
Hayes and Alzado and Long and
Millen. Nasty guys. A.bit of ad-

vice — never, never bet against
the Raiders in the Super Bowl.
The final score was 38-9.

Datelinei 1985. Dan Marino
and Co. outscore opponents in
16 of 18 games, owning the best
offense in the league. San Fran-
cisco stuffs enemy offenses 1 7 of

18 times. Put the two in the Big-

O_ne and the 49ers shut Marino
down in a big way.‘ Defenders
Lott, Wright, Hicks and William-
son clamp down on the Marks
Brothers, while the 49er front
three pressure Marino into sub-
mission. S.F. and its defense pre-
vail in a grand fashion 38-16.
Dateline: 1986.’ The Chicago

Bears. Buddy Ryan. Grabowskis.
Defense, defense, defense. ’Nuff

said about that 46-10 romp.

See the trend? In the 1980s, the
team with the best defense al-
ways wins. Just ask John Madden,
who has picked" every Super
Bowl right since he retired from

coaching and became a CBS’

analyst.

Look for the end of John El-
way’s miracle working. The guys
who wave the magic wands
usually have a rough time of it in
the Super Bowl. Ask Danny Mar-
ino or Craig James. So, it'll be the
New York Giants and Gatorade
bath, 31-14.

By Robert Jordan
Staff Writer '

After the Panthers’ disap-
pointing one—point loss to St.
John's on Monday night,
coach Paul Evans must

_ regroup his outfit and travel to
the Boston Garden for Satur-
day's Big East matchup with
the Boston College Eagles.

This is another game that the

‘Panthersshould win, but if
they're not careful, they could
slip to a paltry 2-3 in the Con-
ference,
Syracuse looming right around

tant road trip for Pitt, as they
desperately need to establish
poise while playing in enemy
territory. And everybody
knows about Pitt's Big East
misfortunes while on the road.
The 8-7 Eagles, although
‘thin in talent, are led by last
season's Big East Freshman-of
the—Year, Dana Barros. The
5-10 point guard is the Eagles’
leading scorer, averaging 19.3
points per game while leading
the team in assists with 59
Other starters include off-

’ _ guard Jamie Benton (12.4), for-
wards Skip Barry and Ted KeI- ‘

stered off the bench by the
steady Troy Bowers; A 6-8

with superpower-

the corner. This is an impor—.

Pitt hopes to curb
bad fortune on the
road in the Big East

power forward . who in the
preseason was projected as a
starter until he was overcome
by nagging injuries. ‘

First-year coach Jim O'Brien
definitely has his hands full.
this season, for he inherits a
program with only one new
recruit and a lack of proven
depth. However, things aren't
all that bad in Chestnut Hill.
The Eagles captured a big win
Tuesday in knocking off rapid-
ly improving Seton Hall
79-75, thus ending a difficult
four—game losing skein..Yes,
they toppled the same Seton
Hall that has defeated George-
town twice this season. So the
Panthers surely can't afford to
take Boston College lightly.

Without a doubt, the Pan-
thers must play a solid 40
minutes if they're going to
build any momentum going
into the crucial Syracuse con-
test. After falling apart in the fi-
nal minutes of the St. John's .
game, coach Paul Evans ad-
mitted, ”We won't win any
more games if we play like this
the rest of the season." Indeed,
‘a master of the obvious.

‘ So, Boston College again as-
sumes the role as the under-
dog. An upset loss here, and
Evans’ Panthers willbe wim-
pering in the Big East's pound.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January 23, T987

Panthers’ 13-4 record not so impressive,“

While the Panthers still try to
search for some character and
confidence following Monday's
loss to St. John's, here are some
assorted thoughts on Pitt’s 13-4
start this season:

0 Don't get too excited about

"that 13-4 record. Consider the

fact that the Panthers haven't
beaten any team they shouldn't
have and that Pitt has lost its four
toughest games so far this year (ll-
linois, Brigham Young, George-

town and St. John's). .

0 Pitt’s 2-2 league record isn't

surprising at all, especially con-
sidering that Curtis Aiken and De-
metreus Gore are a combined 38
of 105 from the floor for 36
percent,
V 0 Anyone who knows anything
about basketball knows what I
know: Jerome Lane is the best
player on the Panther team. Sor-
ry, Charles.

race this year, consider this:
Three of the next four games are
against teams the Panthers should
beat (Boston College, Seton Hall
and Connecticut).

0 it still seems like Pitt can't get

”We work just as hard, if not
harder, than they do,” said
Gerhard, who is 13-3 on the sea
son. ”But the system and the at-
mosphere are better for me here.
I stay healthier.”

Gerhard suffered a broken toe
earlier in the year, and is now tak-
_ing it ”one day at a time" on the
road back to recovery. ‘

Pitt wrestling coach Rande

'- Stottlemyer is enthusiastic about

Gerhard’s comeback.

”Pitt has breathed new life into
Matt as a student athelete,” said
Stottlemeyer. ”But he has to con-
tinue to improve.”

Gerhard feels that just being at
Pitt is an improvement. ”l was
unhappy at Penn State,_thi_n__gs just

any calls from the referees on its
own home court. That's under-
standable, though, because the
referees are used to the lame side-
line antics of Roy Chipman. Chip-
man was so bad at working the
refs that they would simply ig-
nore him at times.

And Paul Evans can't work the
referees much, for fear of draw-
ing a technical foul, something
the Panthers can ill afford in close
games.

”The coaches at Penn State called

Gerhard stated that the at-
mosphere here at Pitt was much
more to his liking.

”Penn State was just too big, it
was like you always had to talk
up to people.” he said, ’’I feel
much more at home here which
helps my schoolwork and my
wrestling.”

' Gerhard has no regrets about
leaving Penn State — currently
the second ranked team in the
country - and isn't bitter, even
though he knows he could have
wrestled for Penn State.

0 What makes the St. John's
loss most disheartening is that
judging by talent and coaching
alone, Pitt is noticeably superior
to the Redmen.

But, then again, the Redmen
know how to win.

0 If this team really has any
character, then it should take its
frustrations out on lowly Boston

College tomorrow night at Boston 

Garden.
But I'm not counting on it.

’’I was as good or better than
the people there. [I] just had a run
of bad luck,” said Gerhard.
”Penn State will be just another

match for me. I'm happy for theffx

guys back there.”

Gerhard is determined to help
Pitt’s program rise to the level of
consistency that Penn State's has
enjoyed/‘Pitt’s program is on the
verge of making better progress,”
he said. ”Gary Bolin and Eric
Wertz, our two captains, along
with Pat Santoro, are the ones set-

ting the precedent. The guys on ,_

the team deserve a lot of credit,
too. |.couldn’t reach my goals in
practice without them.”

Gerhard has loftier goals,
though.

"I honestly believe I can be an
All-American - this year,” said
Gerhard. I want tobe a national
champion. Right now, though, I
have to work a lot harder."

gComini regains both status  AKLANDvALuEs

THE P|TI' NEWS, Friday, Jonuory 23, I987

and place.as men's gymnast

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

After a year off, gymnast Marty
Comini is back. _

”I took a year off because I was
getting into a rut,” said Comini.

« ’’I was having trouble concentrat-
ing in the gym and in my
classes.”

Comini, now a senior from
McMurray, Pa., started gymnas-
tics in his freshman year at Peters
Township High School.

”Cymnastics is so different
here, since ‘we practice year
round,” said Comini. ”In high
school, it only lasted about three

"/\—“~ months.”

T After taking the year off, Comi-
ni did not know whether his
previous tenure would guarantee
him a position on this year's
squad. Now that he has made it
back onto the team, he feels he
has achieved the status he had
previously.

”There’s more pressure since

Comini said he decided to

/ friend named Eddie Miller who

graduated two years ago. He con-
vinced me to go to Pitt. Plus my
major is mechanical engineering,

and Pitt has a good engineering
program.

”And now that I've been here,
I have been able to compete in
gymnastics in more ways than I
ever imagined,” he continued. ”I
especially like the international
meets where we compete against
teams like Russia and Japan.”

Comini’s favorite events are the

‘rings and the floor exercise.

However, it is evident this year‘
that he is open to expand his
honzons

”This year, l’m doing two new
events, the pommel horse and
the parallel bars. The pommel
horse is a frustrating event. It's

hard to get psyched up for it dur-
ing a meet. It's definitely my most
difficult event, while the floor ex-
ercise is the easiest for me,”
Comini said.

Almost every athlete has at
least one or two run—ins with
either officials or judges during
their careers. Comini is no
different. —

”One of the disadvantages of
gymnastics involve the judges,”
said Comini. ”The inconsistent
judging is frustrating; it takes out
some of the competiveness. In a
sense, you're not competing
against another person, you're
competing against the judges."

Five members of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh track and
field team qualified for the
