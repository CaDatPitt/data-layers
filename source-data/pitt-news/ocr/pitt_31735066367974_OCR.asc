Media: A Role inThe MidEasz‘?

By GINA PACHUTA

Most of the information com-
ing out of the Middle East is
polluted by rhetoric and pro-
paganda, according to pro-
fessor Robert Haze who
spoken at an Honors Program
Student Cabinet lecture on
Wednesday.

Hazo, who is the director of
special seminars at Pitt, said
the information Americans
receive concerning the Middle
East comes mainly through
the news media and that infor-
mation is not a true represen-
tation of the Arab world.

He also criticized America’s
foreign policy in the Mid East.
Since the creation of the State

of Israel in 1948, Hazo said
the U.S. has always supported
Israel in its conﬂicts.He cited
the Suez Canal conﬂict as a
major example of U.S. in-
tervention in Mid East affairs
on the side of Israel.

The power that American
Jews have as a special interest
group and strong lobbyists
also puts pressure on the U.S.
government to side with
Israel.

“America bears. a major
responsibility for most or all
of the Middle East problems,”
Hazo said.

Hazo said American foreign
policy over the past 30 years
has applied “simplistic ap-
proaches to complex situa-
tions.” He also blamed the
news media for portraying
Arabs as terrorists.

Seezox photo

“An attempt is made to
debase Palestinians,” he said.
“There’s always Israeli com-
muniques stating ‘Palestinian
terrorists’- there’s never

‘Palestinian’ without ‘terroristf’

Hazo said he has a personal
interest in the happenings of
the Middle East because
many of his relatives still live
in Lebanon and have suffered
because of the longstanding
conflicts in there.

Hazo lived in Lebanon and
held posts in various Arab-
American organizations. He
said the troubles in the Middle
East will continue for a long
time.

“Anyone who believes that
it will be easier or more tran-
quil in the Middle East in the
near future is mad.”

Syria Mosque-PPC
Incident Undecided

By JULIE HORN
AndAMY MEYER

A Shriner’s representative is
claiming that the Syria Mosque
will not remove its manager,
despite a Pitt Program Council
boycott of the Mosque because
of its complaints about her.

Pitt officials, however, said no
decision has been reached on the
matter and that they are dealing
with higher-level Shriners
representatives concerning the
situation. The Shriners own the
Syria Mosque, which has
sometimes been used by Pitt to
host concerts and other
programs.

The PPC deci&éa""‘r'éE‘éht1y to

stop using the Mosque because
of continual problems with Mos-
que manager Dorothy Steele.

PPC advisor Gina Miller said
the charges include: racial slurs,
racist views concerning program-
ming in general, and lack of
cooperation in releasing informa-
tion about PPC programs. She
cited last year’s Chic concert as
an example.

“Once she (Steele) found out
Chic was black, she sat me down
for a half hour telling me what
blacks were like,” Miller said.
Steele also refused to give callers
information about PPC pro-

grams or gave them false infor-
mation, Miller said, adding that
the PPC has records of some of
the conversations.

Steele earlier denied all the
charges. And James Wieland,
recorder for the Shriners, called
the boycott “unfair.” He said it
is the result of misunderstandings

on PPC’s part.
“They have no reason to be
upset,” Wieland said. “This

whole thing is not our fault.”
PPC wrote a letter in March
complaining about Steele, but

received no response. Miller has I

been told that the Shriner of-
ficials will bring the matter up at
their next executive board
meeting.

Wieland, however, says that he
is the Mosque’s manager and
Steele is his secretary. He said a
decision on whether any action
should be taken about Steele is
up to him, and he has decided to
continue employing her.

Both Miller and Andy Smith
said they are waiting for a
response “from what we under-
stand to be the leadership of the
Shriners.” Smith refused to say
what Shriners he was dealing
with but said he expects to hear
from them by next week.

Ex-Prime Minister

By PEGGY FE RRI

The complex situation in Nor-
thern Ireland is often over-
simplified and needs a political
solution according to Garret Fitz-
gerald, former Irish Prime
Minister and current leader of
the opposition party in Ireland.
Garret announced at a press con-
ference yesterday that his party
has outlined a solution to the
problem. .

“Ireland would become a con-
federation of two separate Irish
states which would share some of
the duties, such as security, but
remain separate when it came to
domestic affairs,” Fitzgerald
said. He added that these two
separate heads of state in the
confederation would also work
closely with Britain. According
to Fitzgerald, the solution his
party proposes has been
previously suggested and was
met with favorable response
from the Irish people.

“There has been no significant
dissent expressed in my coun-
try,” Fitzgerald said, adding
that the British private response
has been that a solution must be
something along those lines, but

  Lectures at Pitt

there hasn’t yet been what could
be considered an official
response.

Fitzgerald said that, in addi-
tion to lecturing, the reason for
his visit to the United States was
to maintain contact with Capitol
Hill, where his proposal has also
been positively received.

Fitzgerald also said that Irish-
Americans have expressed their
support.

“Irish-Americans’ role is to
combat those elements who seek
money for the IRA,” Fitzgerald
explained. “The great bulk of
arms used to kill people comes
from the United States.” ‘

He added that the U.S. could
also play a role in the situation
by supporting pressure on the
British government. He said this
doesn’t mean that America
should intervene or impose a
policy.

He emphasized that the con-
flict in Northern Ireland is not a
“theological” one but admitted
that the churches could play a
role in lessening the conflicts.

Concerning the Western
Alliance, Fitzgerald said that the
pipeline situation does weaken
the alliance.

Paying For Prepatory Tests

By MARK SINDLER

Fred Koloc
Advising Center Director

Georgine Materniak
Learning Skills Center _

When facing the decision of
whether graduate. school is in
their future, seniors are first
confronted with the choice of
which university is best
suited for their objectives.

The results of board exams
are partial determinants of
which undergraduates will be
accepted by a school. This un-
covers a financially-dependent
question: Are preparatory
courses, specifically those of-
fered by Stanley H. Kaplan,
worthwhile? '

According to Fred Koloc,
director of the CAS advising
center, people enrolled in
Kaplan’s classes were en-
thusiastic about their results.
However, the course is not
tailored for everyone.

“If someone is disciplined in
preparing for the MCAT or
GAT, for example, he should
not bother spending the

money,” he said. “But,f0I‘_§0m9‘

one withoutl the discipline
or sense of organization, it is
not a bad investment. A large
proportion of students with
Kaplan experience do well on
their exams.”
As did Koloc.

Acting coordinator for the
Learning Skills Center-
Georgine lvlatérniak got her
information on Kaplan from
students who enrolled with
‘him.

“Kaplan hires people who
put together comprehensive
reviews and study guides
which save the student time
in digging through books

{ themselves. After all, the ser-

«\~.;-‘
.1;

Kit“,

vice provides an approach for
students to review tests and
understand their formats and
enables them to deal with
time constraints,” Materniak
stated.

She also said that Kaplan
can determine the types of er-
rors students will encounter,
help them polish up in several
areas and save thema lot Of
time.

As earlier mentioned, Koloc
said students with Kaplan

preparation do well, but “no
one knows why someone with
or without preparation will or
will not do well. However, a
preparatory course like
Kaplan’s is definitely a
confidence-builder. ”

Koloc said that when
students go into a Kaplan-
type course, they must be
motivated to do the work.
That means a commitment of
100-300 hours over a six-
month period. When one pays
the kind of money necessary,
the obligation to be motivated
is indisputable, Koloc
emphasized.

According to Materniak,
Kaplan hires highly-skilled
people for his courses. “Based
on hearsay, they hire med
school students or medical
school professors. They tell
you, in essence, what the
students need to know, ” she
said.

In the past, Pitt offered
students a program similar to
Kaplan’s. What differed,

however, was that Pitt gave a
strategy approach and offered
techniques students could
take into the test.

However, students wanted
a test content review, Mater-
niak said, but this would have
required the hiring of a new
staff. Pitt’s free service pro-
vided reading comprehension
skills and offered test-taking
questions.

“What we provided and
what they (the students)
wanted,” Materniak said,
“were two different things.
We could not give subject
matter reviews." The pro-
gram was disbanded.

What Pitt now offers is an
LSAT videotape workbook
program. This study aid,
backed by the Pre-Law Socie-
ty, is available at Hillman
Library. The Learning Skills
Center also encourages
students I lacking vocabulary
and reading comprehension
skills to upgrade those
abilities.

he said. “As part of the Western
Alliance, we depend on it for our
security. The pipeline problem is
regrettable, and the hope is that
it will be solved.”

It is election time and, accord-
ing to Fitzgerald, Ireland is con-
centrating on other problems.

“The compelling problem right
now is the economy,” he said.
That is not to say, he added, that
the “centuries-old problem of Nor-
thern Ireland is not also a com-
pelling one. *

According to Fitzgerald, the
party’s approach to the problem
in Northern Ireland has been
welcomed in party conferences,
but there are going to be great
difficulties getting plans off the
ground.

“The typical response of Nor-
thern Ireland has been ‘you are
the first person to give us some
hope,’ ” Fitzgerald said. “The
point is that we are willing to do
something positive. The problem
is complex, and the solution too
must be complex.”

He added that the impression
should not be given that the
British and the Irish are seeking
to solve the problem by going
over the heads of the public. The
Irish government seeks discus-
sion with all who want to talk
and identify the problem.

Meeting Behind
Closed Doors

How bright are the state’s sunshine laws?

Not very, according to journalists and
concerned citizens who have felt the brunt of
the law’s limitations. ‘ ,

Sunshine laws are designed to give the
press and, accordingly, the public greater ac-
cess to the workings of the government and
governmental agencies. They make it man-
datory that public officials open their
meetings to the public.

But that’s not always how things work.

Local and‘ municipal governments have
found amultitude of ways to get around the
laws. The most common way is to hold closed
sessions before a public meeting, in which they
actually discuss and argue the important
issues. E

Some argue that it is at those meetings
that the real decisions are made. Public
meetings then become a staged event. In
some of the Pittsburgh suburbs, this is car-
ried to the extreme. Mt. Lebanon is a good
example.

At a Pitt journalism class last term, the
municipal manager of Mt. Lebanon explained
how he stages the meetings of the suburbs’
commissioners: he simply writes a script for
each of them before the meetings. His ra-

tionale? It keeps the commissioners from -

speaking off the tops of. their heads at
meetings.

There are other ways to get around sun-
shine laws. For that reason, many regional
editors are in favor of the current legislation
that would give citizens greater access to
decisions made by politicians and
bureaucrats. .

4 The new legislation proposes that no votes
on any “motion, proposal, resolution, rule,
regulation, ordinance or order” may be taken
during a governmental executive session,

, which can be legally closed to the public.

There are obviously exceptions: personnel
considerations, ‘rental or lease of property
and debated union negotiations are often, for
legitimate reasons, closed to the public.

But there is no excuse for closing sessions

. in order to hold carefully planned events that

allow no room for public input. As the editor
of one local paper explained, this is not
merely a journalist’s issue. It is one that af-
fects the public’s access to information. For
that reason, more expansive sunshine legisla-
tion should be adopted. It would be a
welcome relief to say goodbye to the days of
smoke-filled rooms. ‘

By CHRISTOPHER JOHNS

Almost unnoticed, the Chinese
students at Pitt are busy prepar-
ing for the big celebrations of
two national anniversaries. They
are doing this in two groups,
each excluding the other.
Students from the Chinese
mainland are observing Oct. 1,
the 33rd anniversary of the found-
ing of the People's Republic of
China, which is their National
Day. Students from Taiwan are
observing Oct. 10, the 71st an-
niversary of the 1911 Revolution
led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen which
overthrew the Ching Dynasty
and which is also claimed to be
the National Day.

Imagine American students
observing two different In-
dependence Days in two groups!

The Chinese community at
Pitt is a unique ethnic group. It
is composed of undergraduate
students, graduate students and
visiting scholars from the
Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and other parts of the
world. Some members of the
group are government-sponsored
and "others are privately spon-
sored. A few are self-supporting.

Whatever their political con-
victions, religious beliefs,
academic affiliations and per-
sonal backgrounds, they ,are
mostly quiet, courteous and
amiable as is characteristic of
their long cultural tradition.
Most of them are very hard-
working and take little part in
social life. You may hardly notice
their existence, because you
seldom see them at social
gatherings.

Even though they stick to
their traditional lifestyle, they

readily make friends with people
from other ethnic groups. Most
of the students from the
mainland and from Taiwan are
quite at home making friends
with their American fellow
students. Ironically, it is not so
easy for them to develop friend-
ships with each other. They have
very complex mixed feelings
about each other. On the one
hand they feel‘ drawn towards
each other by the strong feeling
of kinship. After all, they are all
Chinese and as a Chinese saying

 
 

goes: “Five hundred. years ago
our ancestors might have been in
the same family.”

On the other hand they often
feel awkward and ill at ease when
they meet face to face, because
they come from two totally dif-
ferent political systems and the
ideological gulf separating them
is so deep that they are afraid to
reach out their hands to show the
friendliness normally extended
by one compatriot to another.
They are afraid not only for their

own safety but also for that of
their counterparts from the other
side of the Taiwan Straits.

At a Chinese New Year party
given by some pro-Peking
Americans a girl from Taiwan
came to meet her fellow students
from the mainland. When she
found somebody taking snap-
shots, she was frightened and
asked not to have her picture
taken. She didn't want any
publicity and her presence at
such a gathering had to be kept
low-keyed, because otherwise she
might run into trouble after she
returned to Taiwan.

A Taiwanese graduate-
student made a chance acquain-
tance with a Chinese mainland
visiting scholar in the elevator.
They found that they had offices
in the same building. The latter
invited the former to his office to
chat over , a cup of tea. The
Taiwanese student gladly ac-
cepted the invitation, but on
entering the office he hesitantly
asked, “Do you think it‘s OK?
Will my being here cause you any
trouble? Are you being
watched?” 1

Recently a Pitt professor in-
vited two Chinese students to
dinner. One of the students was
from the mainland, the other
from Taiwan. The professor in-
troduced them to each other, but
at the same time feared that the-
two might get into a hot argu-
ment over political issues such as
the American arms sale to
Taiwan. The two students had a
lively conversation. In the end it
turned out that they found that
they shared almost the same
feehngs and views about the
fate of their country and people.

They both hoped that some
day they._ would be able to
celebrate the same National Day.

PINK PLOYD’S THE WALL
Screenplay: Rodger Waters
rDirector:_Alan Parker

By GEORGE HOLZER

The Wall, the album that is, is one of
the most brilliant concept albums
ever made. From the beginning, Pink
Floyd member Roger Waters
intended to put the ideas of the
record on celluloid; after three years,
the project has been completed. The

By PAUL HOUGHTON

The Pittsburgh Playhouse opened
its season with Somethings /lfoot, a
somewhat enjoyable spoof of and
thoroughly lightweight tribute to
-Agatha Christie and her famed mys-
tery story, Ten Little Indians.

Agatha Chtistie was one of the last
of the great Victorian tale-spinners
and mystery moguls, in the tradition
of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator
(or is it biographer?) of Sherlock
Holmes. For the English aristocracy,
the folk with whom Christie is most
concerned, the Victorian era literally
did not end until WWII, long after it
had died out everywhere else. For
these ladies and gentlemen of leisure,
the era was a rich mixture of whimsi-
cal eccentricity, perpetual champagn-
ing at country estates, the cult of the
dashing personality, and the religion
of ”The Empire." Preserved intact so

long wait is easily explained, and
accepted, when one views the film.
Two plots are intertwined; the one
has young Pink growing up. During
this time he experiences voyeurism,
he experiments with pot, his father
dies while fighting in W.W. II, and his
overly protective mother helps him
start building the wall. The other plot
involves adult Pink (played superbly
by Bob Geldof); he has now nearly

completed the wall. People are merely Z

todon in a glacier, this thoroughly
unreal and absolutely’ charming way
of life has for decades been of
immense fascination to Americans,
most of whom would like to believe it
still leads a shadow existence at var-
ied ancestral castles in Devonshire
and Kent, like King Arthur in Avalon.

It is this American fascination with
the bizarre survivability of this color-
ful, British museum-piece version of
the class system that accounts for
much of Agatha Christie's popular-
ity, and it is this that the audience
gets, albeit in lukewarm, patronizing,
stereotypical form, in this musical
comedy. 2

Theshow opens with the redoub-

‘table Lord Ranc0ur's having invited

several interesting specimens of Brit-
ish gentry tohis remote country est-
ate. From that point on, the basic plot,
and fun, of this musical lies in the
ingenious, sometimes funny, but rid-
iculously gimmicky ways in which

After this, the movie becomes...Oh, if

both live actors and animation
sequences are used. Most of the ani-
mation depicts what is happening
inside of Pink's wall; it therefore is
verv explicit and at times disturbing.

these guests are murdered. All this
mayhem never seems to affect their
appetite for song and dance, though,
and the audience is treated to many
pleasant, amusing, but not quite
memorable tunes and lyrics.

I don't think director Don Wads-
worth and the players have a lot to
work with in this musical, but they do
very well with what they have. Kathi
Flemming as Lettie the saucy maid,
John Amplas as Flint the lecherous
caretaker, Larry Heller as Clive the
supercilious butler (who didn't do it),
Cynthia Crass as the lovely ingenue,
William Beck as the family doctor,
Howard Elson as the decadent
nephew, Miriam Kelly as the grand
dame, Joseph Clement as a Dr.

The Wall isnot for everyone. Many
people with weak stomachs will not
like the blood and gore scenes; others
will be turned off by the graphic sex-
ual scenes. To yet others, much of the
symbolism, and therefore the mean-
ing, will be lost or not understood. If
you are a fan of Pink Floyd, or if you
just liked The Wall as an album, you
should definitely see the movie. Like
it or not, The Wall isn't an experience
you'll soon forget.

Watson-like retired colonel, Jeff
Howell as an upper-class college twit,
and Allison Driver as Miss Tweed, a
take-off on Christie's charming little
old lady detective, Miss Marple, are
all quite funny and effective. But
when interesting characters are
almost gratuitously killed it tends to
leave a dissatisfying vacuum in a
show.

The basically good-natured mes-
sage of the show probably lies in thd
line ”Remember, we are British!,”,
from one of the better numbers, and!
the audience is indeed never allowed
to forget this fact. If you don't mind a
light-hearted, lightweight evening at
the theater and away from the boob
tube every now and then, and if
you're able to enjoy an affectionate,
though cliched tribute to Agatha
Christie, mystery stories, and the old
British upper crust, then you will
probably like Somethrings /lfool.

COLLECTED POEMS

OPUS POSTHUMOUS
Wallace Stevens

Vintage (NY) 1982, Paperback
ed. I ’

Wallace ‘Stevens was born in

Reading, Pennsylvania, on
October 2, 1879. He was a grad-
uate of Harvard and the New
York Law School, practicing
law in New York‘ City until
1916. Duringlthese years his
relationships ‘ included artists"
and writers in nearby Greens-
and writers in nearby- Green-
wich Village, among them
William Carlos Williams,
Marinne Moore, and e.e. cum-
mings. His first published
poemsappeared in Poetry, 1914.
From then on he was a consist-
ent contributor to the little
magazines. In 1916 he moved to
Hartford and joined the Hart-

of ford Accident and Indemnity

Company, of which he became
vice-president in 1934. He
remained with the firm until

‘his_d_eat'h in 1955. .
Wallace Stevens won av

number of prizesza Bollingen

Prize, two National Book"

Awards and‘ a Pulitzer Prize..'In

Wallace Stevens'“_ "Whole. Harino-I

nium," Ricl1ard'Allen Blessing

says Stevens "is one of the great

.poets of our century and is

among the greatest of all Amer-
ican poets."

Like a Heraclitus, Stevens
saw the reality as change and
permanence as illusory. An
example of patterns of death
and rebirth, and seasons chang-
ing portrayed in vivid imagery
follow from the poem, ”The
Comedian as the Letter C”:
"The salt hung on his spirit like afrost,
The dead brine melted in him like a dew
Of winter, until nothing of himself
Remained, except some starker, barer
self
In a starker, barer, world.

He appeals to the senses with

rich andgsensuous images in his
poetry. For example, in the fol-
lowing poems the sense of——
Sound: ”Autumn Refrain”:”The
skreak and skritter of evening gone."
”The Plot Against the Gian-
t":"Heavenly labials in a world of
gutterals."
Sight: ”An Ordinary Evening in
New Haven":"On the walk, purple
and blue, and red and gold,/Blooming
and beaming and ooluming colors out. "
Smell: ”Things of August”:"lt is
full of myrrh and camphor of
summer."

Stevens believes that order is

science has also denied imagi-
nation by its literalness and
pragmatism replacing the poe-
try long derived from folklore,
"And nothing is left but comic ugli-
ness/Or a lustred nothingness."

William Carlos Williams in
his New York Times review cites
OPUS POSTHUMOUS as
”eminently readable, even fas-
cinating.” He finds Stevens
early poem, ”Architecture,” a
synopsis of his life plan:
"What manner of building shall we
build?

Let us design a chastel de chastete.
De Pensee....

Never cease to deploy the structure.
Keep the laborers shouldering plinths.
Pass the whole of life earing the clink of
the

Chisels of the stone—cutters cutting the
stone."

In another of his early poems,
”A High—Toned Old Christian
Woman,” a defence of poetry,
he stated his position in the
opening line, ”Poetry is the
supreme fiction, madame.”
Spiritual experiences are not
reserved for old Christian
women. Also about poetry, he
wrote tongue-in-cheek, ”The
poet makes silk dresses out of
worms.”

the red
dragon

RED DRAGON
Thomas Harris
Bantam Paperbacks

To read Red Dragon is to enter
another world. After 30 pages,

. the story envelopes you and by
the end of the book, fears you "

never knew existed have been
tapped.

The Red Dragon is a psycho-
pathic killer who lives for muti-
lating happy families. He is
thorough and extremely bril-
liant, but he is also a demented
and enraged person.

Plotted against this mad-man
is Will Graham, an FBI instruc-

tor, who hasbeencoaxed out of
early retirement to head the

case. Graham has exposed two
psychopaths in the past; it
seems he has a knack, of which
he's terrified, for thinking like
the killers. He spent time in a
mental institution after the
first killing.

The\ story revolves around
Graham's trying to discover the
identity and thought patterns
of the Dragon (as the reader is
told early in the book). Add a
gossip-rag reporter and a blind
woman for color, and a few
twists of the author's mind and
you've got a blockbuster of a
novel on your hands. The
climax leaves the reader
drained and relieved.

This book is not for eve-
ryone, but those of you who
enjoy popular novels will not
want to put it down until the
very last page has been read.

THE SHADOW KNOWS
Diane Johnson
Vintage Books

So perhaps the title isn't orig-
inal, but it does manage to
accomplish the desired effect; it
catches your eye and intrigues
you enough to at least open the
book. Almost immediately you

get caught up in a fast-paced, "

suspenseful, yet intricately
woven drama.

The main character and
heroine of this novel is Mrs. N.
Hexam, a 28-year-old divorcee,
and mother of four young child-
ren. In the beginning of this
book she is having an affair
with her ex-husband's business
partner, and as is often the case,

  the shadow knows

fears an unwanted pregnancy.
Sounds typical, right? How-
ever, just when you think you
can close the book and write the
ending yourself, the plot
evolves into a bizarre series of
events of mindless terror.
Along with the normal trau-
mas of a young single parent,
Mrs. N. Hexam suffers the

humiliation of being forced to .

live in a low rent housing pro-
ject as she struggles to complete
her M.A. To add to her plight,
she and her family are subjected
to violent episodes of vandal-
ism and personal attacks.

The reader is given just
enough incriminating informa-
tion on all the characters in N.

Hexam’s life to suspect them all
of being the vandalism culprits.
Unfortunately, each character's
development is basically equal,
so there is no enlightenment as
to who or what the adversary is.
All the reader knows is that the
ex-husband, former (mad)
maid, current lover's wife, and
present maid’s (not so reputa-
ble) boyfriend all could have
reason enough to subject N.
Hexam to the bouts of horror
that threaten her daily life.
Diane Johnson teases the
reader by drawing out the
”whodunit" theme throughout
the entire novel, and then still
never divulging the actual foe.
She leads the reader to think

that the antagonist in this book, ,

or the "Shadow” as the title
depicts, is really the terror and
imagined fears in N. Hexam’s

_mind. Is it her own personal

.
:1

madness, or: is she really an
innocent bystander under a ter-
’ rorist’s siege? Read the book

and draw your own conclu
sions!

KATHY PUSTEIOVSKY

masterofthe moor

piece, is a quick-paced, modern
day mystery that catches the
reader's interest and then
catches the reader off-guard
just as the story seems to be
heading to a logical conclusion.

Basically, the story revolves
around "Stephen, a young man
who has spent his life walking
on the moor in his village,
pondering his tenuous linkage

with a famous writer of the past .

(Stephen's mother was the
author's illegitimate daughter).

cry to heaven

Cry to Heaven
Anne Rice
Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. $15.95
To those of you who will-
ingly allowed yourselves the
exquisite pleasure of seduction
by a horrific and captivating
tale in Anne Rice's first novel,
Interview with the Vampire, her
second book, Cry to Heaven, is a
bit of a letdown. Though stylis-
tically and technically imper-
fect, the subject matter—the
world of Italy's famed Castrati
_singers of the 18th gentury———is
interesting and worthy of such
a tale,but it has no spirit. Cry to
Heaven is nothing more than a
retelling of the common histor-
ical novel as we know it——
terrible wrong is done to the
hero, the hero suffers but
meanwhile becomes the pinna-
cle of some society—and in the
end receives his just revenge
for the wrong he has, rightly or
wrongly, felt impinged upon
him. Whether reaching the

court of Charles I, a la Kathleen

Windsor, or becoming the most
powerful woman in Rome, a la
Taylor Caldwell, i_t’s ‘ all the
same.

It's too common a plot; there
is no surprise when fame, glory,
wealth, and beauty all fall at the
hero's feet. Yet Cry to Heaven is
impossible to put down, clearly
an entertaining and absorbing
novel of those things listed
above.

Ideally that isn't bad. Except,
novels like this have no soul.

and that is what distinguishes a
good novel from a great work
that lives in the mind. Interview
with The Vampire needless to say,
lives in the minds of those who
were drawn under the power
and charm, and anquish of so
absorbing a character, so
absorbing a life.
Unfortunately, Cry to Heaven
just doesn't have the emotion
necessary to captivate the
reader and make the reader
become ‘the story. It does have
interesting and sympathetic
characters, and few could be
cold-hearteda enough to not
empathize with Tonio when
he's cut, losing, or so he
believes, his manhood forever.
The perpetrator ofthis act is his
once-banished brother Carlo,
and the reasons for action are
plain. For daring to love a
woman beneath his station,
Carlo, this last living son of a
Venetian nobleman, this last
link in the long and distin-
guished line of the Treschi fam-
ily, is banished. His elderly
father remarries, and it is this
union that produces the bain of
Carlo’s life—-his brother Tonio.
It is Carlo who forever con-
demns Tonio to the life of the
Castrati-men whose soprano
voices were the most sought
after in Europe. Every opera of
the time "was written for the
unbelievable purity of song
that even women, in their high
thin voices, cannot match. It is
into this world that Tonic is

One day, Stephen finds the
body of a young girl who has
been strangled and whose long
blonde hair has been cut off
(”How did heknow herhair was
long?"). When he reports his
find to the police, he is given
prime suspect status and his
only thought is that his pre-
cious moor will now be cra-
wling with police and
spectators.

In the meantime, Stephen's
wife begins to have an affair

 

thrust, and it is in this world he
must learn to live.

The world of the Castrati is
brought to the pages in a vivid,
and exhilarating manner. Anne
Rice is an incredibly fine writer
who relies on carefully con-
structed plots and brilliant
characterizations. But this
work lets the reader know that

with a man in the village and
the list of possible suspects
grows. When another girl is
found murdered, Stephen
decides that he musttry to find
the killer in order to make the
moor safe again and secluded

‘ (for his own walks).

Be forewarned that the
emphasis in this book is on plot
advancement, so don't look for

any detailed character develop- '

ment or poetic description of
the English countryside. How-
ever, if you're looking for a
dark, rainy night's entertain-
ment, lock the doors, put your
trusty revolver under the pi!-
low and pull out Master of The
Moor.

RIO
-Duran Duran
Capitol Records

Duran Duran's second album,
Rio, deserves a different
(although belated) opinion than
that recently granted by Playboy.
Come on, Playboy, for a maga-
zine that prides itself on diverg-
ing attitude and experimen-
tation, you sure have your head
up your ass about music. Playboy
introduces the latest in fashion,
food, stereo, luxury, etc., but

music??? By carelessly placing
Rio on their "Trust Us-—D‘on"t
Bother” list, they unfortunately
deprive the less adventuresome
record buyers (most of their
readers...most of us) from an
extremely versatile addition to
their record collections. With
Rio, Duran Duran generates
moods compatible with a
sophisticated nightclub, a Walk-
man, or a hot date.

This album resembles their
first effort in its danceability

IDIUIIQAN,

 . DRA URAN

and upbeat sound, but goes on
with a more layered effect, giv-
ing it a sexier sound that Playboy
should have considered compli-
mentary to the general tone of.
its ‘publication. The title track
most obviously displays this. In
"Rio," layered should be
thought of like spumoni ice
cream: lots of individuality that
somehow blends into a totally
unique flavor.

The lead vocals (Simon
LeBon) have pleasant, unpredic-

table fluctuations, straying
from the prosaic verse/refrain
style without losing the pop
sound that makes Duran Duran
such a (potential?) success. The
next layer, bass, builds to an
exciting "solo duel” with the
saxophone contributed by Andy
Hamilton. This song, along with
their first Rio single "My Own
Way," and the already success-
ful video/single "Hungry Like
the Wolf," provides plenty of
radio material, which is unjustly
ignored, at least in Pittsburgh.

Flip it over to my favorite
side, and hear what good
songwriters Duran Duran are;
no single member takes credit
for a song; all are composed by
the band. Love songs, memories
and the struggles, whatever;
these four tracks are soothingly
melodic, and, you cannot escape
the effects they emit. I don't
even have a favorite on this
(excellent) side.

Duran Duran also dropped
the hype (thanks), as evidenced
by the cleaner, more sophisti-
cated photograph on, the inner
sleeve. Cover art, still done by

‘Malcolm Garette of Assorted

Images, seems to have a lot in
common with an artist, Pat
Nagel, associated with Playboy.
Final note: if you can't fork
out the dollars for the excellent
LP, there is a dancey remix EP
for $3.99 containing several
prime Rio cuts, along with a
night version of "Girls on Film."
Enjoy.

Peter Gabriel spoke of his
third solo album as being to
"superficially unattarctive" for
the casual listener. His albums
can be judged by their covers,
which are simply titled, Peter
Gabriel, and display grotesque
photography that echoes the
Expressionist's and present
their themes both inside and
out. His fourth album, Security,
like the third one, is an intense
exploration into the emotional,
muddled world of this artist's
psyche. Gabriel's work since
Genesis has been so personal
and psychologically exhausting
that it can only be taken
seriously or not at all. His third
album was a work of a seem-
ingly dangerously obsessed
individual whose combination
of distorted rhythms and topics
of assassinations, sexual intrud-
ers, and other perversities
created a scenario that was
shocking and appalling, as well
as being painfully honest.

"The Rhythm of The Heat"
opens Security with what sounds
like a religious wail and a few
ominous gong-like beats of a
synthesizer. The singer expe-
riences an epiphany at a tribal
Indian dance ceremony, where a
rhythm and a spirit enter his
body. The music is a mysterious
dirge with sparse, pounding
bass drums, a synthesizer, and a
flute which leads into a furious
array of primitive percussion.
The whole thing would be
enough to scare people from
their radio and elicit the loss of a
few sponsors. Gabriel is back in
top form.

t‘ ’  ‘His’ "\7"<Si“ce‘“t:a‘n' soar“ from the *

 

of the bass and drums, and the
distant, brooding synthesizers.

In "San Iacinto," he recreates
the setting where the Indians
were rampaged by Texans, and
he cites modern examples of the
white man's exploitation of the
Indians, like "Sit 'n' Bull Steak-
house." The album recurrently
deals with the disenchantment
of certain American social prac-
tices, and the escape into private
netherworlds. In "Lay Your
Hands On Me," the singer
searches for the essence of
human feeling, as he turns his
spirit off to plastic, material illu-
sions of beauty: "Poolside laughter
has a cynical bite...I walk away from
sight and sound, down stairways lead-
ing underground."

The highlight of "Security" is
"Wallflower," where the scene
takes place in the cell of a man
who doctors claim is psychopa-
thic. The melody is haunting
and beautiful with a distant
piano building with the emotion
of Gabriel's powerful voice, as
he consoles the lonely prisoner
with reassurances of "Hold
on...I will do what I can do." In
this moment, Gabriel detaches
himself from the role of the vic-
timized criminal, and he is able
to empathize with this lost
member of society.

Security is unlike any other
music being produced, and it is
driven by compulsion and
sincerity. Gabriel investigates
life by seeking its sources and
outcomes, stepping in and out
of harmony with himself and
society to find that we often
feed the fires that rage within

and around us.

Manhattan Boogie-Woogie
Landscape
RCA

Somebody correct me if I'm
wrong, but didn't disco die a
‘much deserved death some two
years ago? That being the case,
no one bothered to tell RCA or
the members of Landscape, a
trendy (I didn't say which trend)
British group who touts them-
selves as purveyors of the "New
White Disco.”

According to their leader,
"We decided to get away from
the screaming guitars and
vocals that were such mid-
seventies cliches.” Instead,
they've adopted the pro-
grammed synthesizers and bor-
ing vocals that were such
late—seventies cliches. While I
have nothing against theiuse of
high—technology in the fields of
art and music (computerized
and video advances can be quite
exciting in the right hands),
Landscape has idolized the tech-
nology_to the exclusion of minor
considerations such as artistry,
creativity and originality.
Granted, these often don't
count for much in today's music
business, but they do help to
make a song hummable."

What really makes Landscape
irritating is that the technique
and mixing of this album are
flawless. Then again, when
your entire operation is compu-
terized it doesn't take much
engineering ability, and how
much technique does it take to

play disco anyway? Still, I find it
personally aggravating that the
big record companies release
crap like this when there are

dozens of other (quality) bands"

who don't get the attention they
deserve.

Manhattan Boogie-Woogie is a
collection of rehashed disco riffs
combined with stupid lyrics
("When you leave your lover/one of
you must suffer") and served up
with all the artistic integrity of
Accounts Receivable software.
Landscape should take the
advice offered by one of their
songs, ”Colour Code," and ”tell
me something new."

FOREVER CAME TODAY
The Flesheaters
Ruby Records/Slash

 

L.A. punk as its own genre
hasn't really gotten beyond Tin-
seltown's city limits, though it
can't be said it hasn't tried. The
Blasters and the Go-Go's don't
count 'cos they're not even close
to "punk,"and X don't count
because, while they might be
loosely defined as punk, they're
definitely not of the L.A. let's-
all-bleed-together breed, and
besides, they've not yet "made
it" in terms of commercial or
financial success (tons of media
clippings don't matter). Groups
like Fear, the Germs, or Plugz?
Nah, we've read about them,
but maybe five people bought
one of their records. And now,
here are the Flesheaters with
Forever Came Today, which will
be...forgotten tomorrow. This
LP won't do anything to help
L.A.'s hard-core scene pene-
trate the market, either.

Maybe the Flesheaters are a
little more accessible than, say,
Black Flag, but that's still no
great point in their favor. Not
one cut stands out with a beat
that'll hold you entranced or a

line that you can't stop singing '

for the rest of the day. And the
lyrics.....7! They read like they're
penned by a 17-year-old
pseudo—intellectual who's into
death, destruction, and repeti-
tion. Baaad stuff. Evidence:
"Cheek flesh jutting hone sear and pull

me_in[Mark the desperate, eye, mark

eye" ("A Minute To Pray, A
Second To Die")

Overall, the music's not too
terrible—high level garage

"Never Gonna Let You Go"
The Rockaways b/w

”Deep Dreaming”

Regina Richards

Iohnny Apollo Records

"Never Gonna Let You Go"—
A deceptively simple tune;
instantly reminds you of a
hybrid between the Everly
Brothers and Rockpile —- it's that
potent, and not in any sense
bizarre. Catchy, light, bub-
bly,arzd back-up vocals the likes
of which haven't been heard of
since the '50s. Actually,
nothing's clung to the musical
veins this well since "Book of
Love" and that's no small potato
compliment.

"Deep Dreaming" -— Fits into
the same boot as the above: a

'50s soul with a country heart.

Regina Richards is sort of a big
deal with the "in" underground
musical circles of NY (meaning
she gets mentioned in NYRocker
a lot), but I can't imagine why,
for she's much closer to Little
Eva or even Patsy Cline that she
is to Lydia Lunch or Poly Sty-
rene. This song is a wonderful
throwback to that early girl sin-
ger style (please, we don't even
think of The Go-Go's here!) but
never sounds like a mere tribute
—-—Richards’ rendering is too ori-
ginal for that; it makes you feel
that Patsy Cline would've been
proud to have released "Deep
Dreaming" herself. (Both the
Rockaways’ song and Regina
Richards’ song appear onsides
A and B of this 12" single, avail-
able at Jim's Records.)

avenged last year’s lost to Slip-
pery Rock by acing the Rockets
with an identical score in
Wednesday's match at the Trees
Hall courts. .

Slippery Rock came into the
match with a 4-1 record, but the
Panthers pulled in five of the six
singles matches and one doubles
match to boost its season record
to 4-0.

Pitt's Cathy Jacobson started
the match off by downing
previously undefeated Jodi Kest
6-2, 7-5 in what head coach
George Dieffenbach called “a
very close fought match.”

Meanwhile, Lisa Lafuria of
Pitt boosted her record to 3-1 by
smashing Rocket Lori Mascia
7-5, 6-2. '

“Lisa played a really consis-
tent, reliable game,” Dieffenbach
said. “She showed great control
over her racket and just’ wore
down her opponent.”

Miriam Goltz’s conditioning
paid off as she came back after
dropping the first set to outlast
SIif)péi‘.y_Rock’s Beth
Fedorowich 5-7, 6-4, 6-0, while
Lynda Chaukin gave the Rockets
their only singles win, beating
Pitt’s Linda Stadler 6-1, 6-4.

Freshman Kristine Peckman
remained undefeated winning
over Lynn Poznanski 6-3,‘ 6-2.
Another Pitt freshman, Jody
Levine, made her debut on the
singles courts by whipping
Cathy Heltzman 6-3, 6-0.

Dieffenbach said, “I was very
happy with our singles matches,
but I was very disappointed with
our doubles.”

The Lady Panthers dropped
two of the three matches, but
Dieffenbach attributed it to the
performance of Slippery Rock,
saying, “Jodi Kest of Slippery
Rock really served and played
well in her doubles match.”

In the number two doubles
match, Levine and Goltz were
the only double winners for Pitt
as they teamed up against

Chaukin and Mascia and won the
6-4, 4-6, 6-4 battle, while at
number three, Pitt's Jodi Mat-
tioli and Kristine Peckman went
on the courts together for the
first time and lost to Lynne Poz-
nanski and Theresa Gotter 6-3,
6-2.

The team will get a week off to
work out its problems and
prepare for Thursday’s trip to
West Liberty.

Dieffenbach said, “The team’s
coming along great, they're gain-
ing their confidence and playing
well, but West Liberty is going
to be a tough match. They have a
lot of scholarship players, and
we’re really going to have to play
competitively if we even want to
be in the match.”

,3, Spikers Ready For Tourney  

",”"1’»" ,

By MARK SINDLER

The Lady Panther volleyball
team is accomplishing big things
lately. Of no consequence, you
say? There are other pressing

‘ matters, you dare ask? Save for

the Mid East and the economy's
state, the uninitiated take
heed.

The squad is in the midst of a
highly momentous 16-game win
streak and a 16-match win
streak—the latter a record in
Pitt’s women's athletic
history. In facing the unlikely
prospect of losing Ulana
Kohutiak’s services due to in-
jury, players coming off the
bench are subbing effectively.

Coach Shelton Collier said,
“Since Ulana’s loss, our prac-

tices have been much better, and

«V.

the team has adapted, to being
without her. Yes, the team had
doubts about whether we could
keep winning, and even I had my
doubts as to whether we could
continue our winning streak.

“Carmen (Tapia) is really com-
ing on and is happy to be back at
the spot she played in Puerto
Rico (middle blocker) while subb-
ing for Ulana."

Playing right-side blocker,
Tapia usually lined up against
the opponent’s best spiker, but
with her moving over, Pat
Belcher and Sally Gillespie will
fill‘in adequately.

Collier also added, “All the
other spikers must improve their
efficiency. We usually give the
ball to Ulana to finish off the op-
ponent. Now, though, we must
compensate for her loss’?

«-~-~~r~»>~- r='7,'.'\'v v1\R'-v~~-,nu~ .... 'f~V-V . ... . ..,_. . . ..

Both teams’ play will have to
be adequate as the Lady Pan-
thers prepare for the West
Virginia Invitational. Those par-
ticipating in the round-robin
tournament also include Temple,
Georgetown, Rhode Island and
Kent State.

In Collier’s eye, the Hoyas rate
a solid fourth in the East-with
Pitt, Penn State and Temple in
front——-and right behind Pitt in
the Big East.

“Right now,” Collier maintain-
ed, “Georgetown stands in our
way. This would be clear to any
objective observer. We must
play well against them, in
preparation for the Big East
championships. We have to con-
vince them that we are better.”

A solid plus for Collier is the
Hoyas’ record. Hoya coach Joe

_.The armual interstate fighting
matches have returned to Pitts-
burgh. Yes, Pitt and West
Virginia will once again renew
their sometimes bitter rivalry at
12:35 at Pitt Stadium. There is
no doubt that there are hordes of
Mountaineers among the sellout
crowd coming into the Pitts-
burgh area, ready to tear apart
anything that resembles a
Panther.

Recently, the bitterness has
been with the West Virginia
folks, cursing for revenge after
their heroes succumbed to the
much bigger and talented Pan-
thers. In recent years, Pitt would
simply run West Virginia out in-
to the Monangehela River. The
Mountaineers, however, believe
they have a legitimate chance to
win tomorrow’s game, which
would be the first win since
WVU kicker Bill McKenzie
booted a field goal in the closing
seconds to defeat the Panthers in
1975.

They did have a glimmer of
hope last year when quarterback
Dan Marino was injured and
unable to play, but the rushing
game and the defense rose to the
occasion in a 17-0 win. This year,
it’s a different story. One reason
is the outstanding rebuilding job
of West Virginia head coach Don
N ehlen. Another reason, in a dif-
ferent sense, is again Marino.

Once a leading candidate for
the Heisman Trophy, Marino’s
statistics have been far from
spectacular. In fact, Penn State’s
Todd Blackledge and West
Virginia’s Jeff Hostetler have
better statistics than Marino.

Head coach Foge Fazio believes
that Marino is ready to show th

McClure is sporting a 3-4 mark
and is not enchanted with his
team's play.

“I am not too pleased,” said
McClure. “We are a much better
team than is showing right now.
This is due to the incorporation
of two freshmen starters, and it
will take time ‘for them to
adjust.”

“Looking at this team,” .he
continued, “I can tell that at any
moment I see us coming together

all-tirne passer.

“Dan has been throwing bet-
ter,” Fazio said. “If his timing is
back, you'll see Marino throw
like he has in the past.”

Marino will be throwing
against a veteran secondary led
by free safety Tim Agee. Despite
his 5-10, 180 lb. frame, the senior
is second on the team in total
tackles, first in solo tackles and
he has intercepted one pass in
1982. Other starters are corner-

,, backs Steve Newberry, Reggie

Armstead and Mike Scott—who
leads the team in interceptions
with two—and strong safety
Gregg McGowan. -

The important part of the
‘Mountaineer defense is its
linebackers. Seniors Dennis
Fowlkes and Darryl Talley are
named Mr. Inside and Mr. Out-
side, respectively. Fowlkes leads
the team in tackles with 36;
Talley is considered one of the
East’s top linebackers. Dave
Preston, who is third in tackles,
and Ed Hughes are the other
starters. I

The defensivélineiis anchored by
senior tackle Todd Campbell.
Cambell was named honorable
mention All-America by the
Associated Press in 1981. Other
starters are Jim Merritts at mid-
dle guard and Chuck Harris at
the other tackle spot. Dave
Obalk may take over for Merritts
as he has recovered from his
ankle injury.

Hostetler has filled the space
left open by the graduation of
Oliver Luck. In three games this
season, the Penn State transfer
has completed 46 of 91 passes
and is good for 795 yards and six
touchdowns. ‘

West Virginia has a corp of
receivers that can match what

McClure is always under the
hindrance of working with a
small squad, and as a result,
freshmen are regular com-
ponents. Also, Georgetown lacks
a physical education department
and does not have any walk-on
potential.

portant opponent for us. and we

Struggling Panther Offense
Needs To Regain Confidence

By Barry Zasloff

As Foge Fazio stood atop a
locker room bench rehashing to
the media how the Panther
defensive unit had just knocked
Illinois quarterback Tony Eason
senseless, a voice from the
distance questioned, “But what
about the offense?”

The focus rather abruptly
shifted from a defensive unit
that moments earlier had sacked
Eason nine times, intercepted
five of his passes, held Illinois to
-27 yards rushing and turned a
3-0 deficit into a 7-3 lead when
Dave Puzzuoli intercepted an
Eason pass and rambled 95
yards.

Fazio paused a second,
gathered his thoughts and
answered the question in a man-
ner that suggested the scribbler
wasn’t the only one more con-
cerned about discussing the in-
consistent offense than the
awesome defense.

“Offensively, we need con-
sistencv." Fazio said. “We’ve
played 12 quarters now, and we
don’t have consistency.”

    

The offense, once believed to
be the most explosive in the na-
tion, as well as the strong link to
a possible national champion-
ship, has thus far been a flop.

The offense, which consists of
All-America Jimbo Covert and
future All-America Bill Fralic
on the line, All-America Dan
Marino at quarterback, Julius
Dawkins and Dwight Collins cat-
ching passes and 1,000 yard
tailback Bryan Thomas, has
repeatedly squandered the many
opportunities provided by the
defense.

The offense, which was suppos-
ed to tear apart yardage like a
Sherman Tank crunching across
an open field, has operated more
like a stripped down Volkswagon
on a crowded street.

Marino has struggled at the
steering wheel, having not yet
released the heavy artillery.
Against Illinois, he missed open
receivers, particularly tight end
John Brown twice in the end
zone. Several times he forced the
ball into crowds of defenders,
resulting in four interceptions.
When he spotted the open

    
    

receiver, the passes were slightly
overthrown.

Confidence appears a problem.
Facing North Carolina, Florida
State and Illinois in successive
weeks, hasn’t helped matters.
The upcoming game with West
Virginia will not be a breather
either.

After that, though, the
schedule eases considerably with
games against Temple, Rutgers,
Louisville and Army. If the of-
fense starts functioning the way
many believe it can against the
Mountaineers, or if the defense
has another game-saving perfor-
mance left, the pressure will be
eased.

The quality of the opposition
will allow Marino and the offense
to regain its confidence. It
doesn’t take much to run up 40
points against Army and
Louisville.

By the time Penn State and
Notre Dame challenge Pitt, the
Panthers’ offense should have
returned to its former habits —
moving the ball downfield with
little difficulty, regardless of how
talented the opponents are.

Then, perhaps, the defense
rather than the offense will be
singled out after a great
performance.

are both in the Big East, so if we
come to grips with Pitt, we will
be alright. Pitt is a very special
team for us.”

In sizing up other schools,

Temple will enter the invitational .

with an 8-0 record. The Owls’
coach, Kay Corcoran, heads up a
team—not very big, but multi-
faceted.

“We have not broken down yet
offensively or defensively,” she
commented. “We have a good
solid, versatile defense and a
quick, fast offense.”

The Owls’ squad consists of
three juniors, two sophomores
and one freshman. It is a team,
Corcoran said, that will be in the
invitational’s finals against Pitt.

Rhode Island’s Robert
Schneck is rebuilding the Rams’
volleyball program and coaches a
14-member team, eight of which
are freshmen.

“It is a little early,” Schneck
asserted,” but I am pleased so
far. We are not together and
have not established a pecking
order as to who the good players
are. We have to start to establish
consistencies.”

The Rhode Island program is a
big-money one. Last year was the
first time the Rams hired a per-
manent coach and took a serious
interest in the sport. Their 11-4
record reveals the sincere effort
by the school to seek quality
recruits and revive the program.

If it is any indication, the Lady
Panthers are in good shape, -ac-
cording to Tachikara’s latest na-
tionwide poll. The Japanese
manufacturer of volleyball equip-
ment placed Pitt in the Top 30,
below the Top 20 teams that
received 10 or more points.

This can only serve to prove
that Pitt is starting to make its
move—in the fast lane.

ﬂField Hoc

By Tammy Anderson

There is one word that can be
used to describe the Lady Pan-
ther field hockey team’s 5-2 loss
to West Virginia Wesleyan on
Wednesday: Frustrating.

Frustrated describes the emo-
tional state of Pitt’s goalies Col-
leen Ahern and Tammy Ander-
son after being scored on five
times. That word also expressed
the sentiments of the Lady Pan-

§”?’tvh.er’s offense, who kept the ball

in Wesleyan territory for most of
the game but could only manage
to score two goals. This one word
will even describe the feelings of
Pitt’s defense, who basically con-
trolled the tempo of the game,
only to break down in composure
a few crucial times.

Lady Panther coach Cindy
Baldridge said, “You can control
the ball for the entire game, but
if you don’t put it in the cage.
you won’t win. The name of the
game is to score.”

West Virginia Wesleyan did.

5- just that. Within the first 10

minutes of the game, Wesleyan
broke away from Pitt’s defense
to score the opening goal of the
game. Several minutes later,
Wesleyan baffled Pitt's defense
again and scored to take a two-
goal lead. The Lady Panthers
answered back when senior
Margie Hall deflected a drive by
sophomore Terry Zygarowicz in-
to the goal cage. Zygarowicz
received the assist on the goal as
the first half ended 2-1.

Wesleyan got off to a quick
start in the second half by scor-
ing on a one-on-one fast break to

up give them a 3-1 lead. After

If“,
.‘ ,5.

K». .

“several

minutes of play
dominated by the Lady Pan-
thers, Wesleyan capitalized on a
breakdown in Pitt’s defense and
scored once again.

The Lady Panthers’ chances oi
gaining their first victory looked
bleak at this point in the contest.

Those chances looked better,

briefly, after a strong offensive
attack by Pitt forced a penalty
stroke. Sophomore Deb Madara
took the stroke for the Lady Pan-
thers and flicked the ball past the
Wesleyan goalie to close the gap
to 4-2.

However, this was as close as
the Lady Panthers were able to
get to that first victory. West
Virginia’s offense ignited for its
fifth and final goal of the game
minutes after Madara scored for
Pitt. Wesleyan’s 5-2 victory over
the Lady Panthers on Wednes-
day was indeed a very
frustrating experience for Pitt’s
field hockey team.

Nonetheless, Baldridge com-
mended sophomore Stella Volpe
for her aggressive play.

Will the Lady Panthers field
hockey team ever post a victory?

Baldridge said, “There is
something missing in our play.
That something is keeping us

 from finding that winning com-
2 bination. It’s frustrating to lose

games when vou know vou are
o ' ' )9
getting closer to wmmng.

Whatever the case, the Lady
Panthers will get another chance
at winning that first victory to-
day against Indiana University
of Pennsylvania at Trees field.
There may be some good news
for the Lady Panthers—IUP is
also seeking its first win.

to Fazio.

“Their receivers are just as

Fazio said.

Mark Raugh is considered by
many to be one of the premier
tight ends in the college ranks.
The 6-3, 205 lb. senior shares the

catches for 105 yards and one
touchdown. Wide receiver Dar-
rell Miller, who is coming back
from knee surgery in 1981,
shares the’ reception lead with
Raugh. Wide receiver Rich
Hollins has been the big play-
man for the Mountaineers in
1982, averaging over 30 yards a

touchdowns. Wayne Brown,

West Virginia to have a chance
of outending the Panthers.
N ehlen has been fairly pleased
with the protection so far, but he
is not satisfied with the late hits
Hostetler has been receiving.

“I feel the protection has been
decent,” Nehlen said, “but I'm
disappointed at the way the of-
ficials have been treating our
quarterback. Oklahoma,

Maryland and Richmond haveii

tried to kill him.”

‘ Center Dave Johnson is the
main force of the Mountaineer
line. Assisting him are guards
Bill Legg and Scott Barrows and
tackles Kurt Kehl and Ray
Hoisington.

The running game isn't
outstanding, but it gets the job
done when needed. Although on-
ly one runner has gained over
100 yards this season, Mickey
'Va1czak, Curlin Beck, King
Harvey and Ron Wolﬂey provide
just enough to keep the defense
from keying on the passing
a tack.

One of the strong players on
the Mountaineers is kicker Paul
Woodside. Woodside has hit 13
consecutive field goals, only
three away from the NCAA
record held by Steve Little of
Arkansas.

“Woodside gives West
Virginia a new dimension,” Fazio
said.

Nehlen has tried to downplay
the importance of this game to
the media.

“Pitt is only in the fourth
game of the season and there are
seven left,” Nehlen said. “I ‘like
to play one game at a time.”

Pitt’s middle guard J .C. Pelusi ‘

is not hiding his sentiments
about playing West Virginia,

“This is one of our biggest
games of the year, and I’m look-
ing forward to it,” Pelusi said.
,“This is the best team they have
ever had.”

There is little doubt that tom-
morrow’s game will be the best
game played in a long while.

At Link,

We Make the Possible Happen

Ed Link had the right idea at the right
time. '

Way back in 1929 when Ed Link built his
first trainer to teach people how to fly, he
helped make it possible for a fledgling air-
craft industry to keep growing. And, more
importantly, he created (a new technology
—-SIMULATION. During World War ll, Ed
Link's famous “Blue Box” trained thou-
sands of allied pilots. *

Today, Simulation is the key to de-

fense...to the development of safe and '
- efficient energy systems...to pioneering

new frontiers.

Think about it!

Colonels Jack R. Lousma and C. Gordon
Fullerton, the Commander and pilot of the
shuttle Columbia’s third flight, as did the
astronauts before them, credit their space-
craft’s successful flight to the many hun-
dreds of hours spent training in a Link
simulator.

And so it goes. Link continues to develop
and introduce sophisticated simulation
techniquesthat find application to an ever
widening range of fields. Link simulation
systems are used to teach navigation, and
for tactical and anti-submarine training. A
Link device trains commercial pilots to
guide ships through busy harbors anytime,
and in any weather. in industry you'll find

...Before it Happens.

Link simulators are critical to the_safe,
cost—efficient operation of nuclear and
fossil-fueled power generating facilities.
No matter what the area of application,
Link state-of-the-art simulation systems
demand the creativity of highly skilled

and motivated professionals. Ours is as

demanding business...success depends
on our ability to meet new technical
chaﬂenges. <

Link’s environment is progressive and
geared to growth. There are opportunities
for Electronic and Electrical Engineers; for
Mechanical and Chemical Engineers; and
for Physics, Mathematics and Computer
Science graduates as well as those with
business degrees. Really, openings at all
levels of experience in most degrees. »

Link provides new employees with a

- PROFESSIONALLY PREPARED ORIENTA-

TION PROGRAM to help ease their tran-
sition from the academic world to the
practical business world.

THINK LINK. There's no better place to
begin a rewarding and meaningful career
than with the leader.

lege placement office, or write directly to
