  Three Guilty OfAssault
For Classified Ad  

A By PEGGY FERRI

- " Pm News Staff Writer

Three students were found guilty
of assault and placed on probation
by the Campus Judicial Board
(CBJ) for putting a classified adver-
tisement in The Pitt News.

The three defendants, Alan
GLadish, Douglas Levers and Peter
-Kanaitis were found guilty of assault
on Feb. 10 by the CBJ.

According to the Student Code of
Conduct, such an offense is commit-
ted when “a student threatens (by
anyﬂmeans), intimidates, coerces, or
uses physical force in a manner
which endangers the health or safety
of a person or which ‘reasonably
causes a person to be fearful ofphys-
ical or emotional harm.”

Last Halloween, Gladish placed
an ad in The Pitt News which,
according to the CBJ, was defama-
tory against a female Pitt student.

The student received harassing
‘phone calls that night and a copy of

. the ad, circled in red ink, was placed
under her door. i
On Nov. 11, the student and Resi-
dent Director Peggy Romanachek
3 filed a complaint against Gladish.
When asked for details, Romana-
chek declined comment, adding she

“Getting rid of unborn children
because they’re nuisances is making
them pay for their conception. If we
let abortion get by, then it won't be
long until other nuisances, such as
the mentally retarded and the per-
manently insane, get eliminated,”
said Jeannie Wallace.

did not “feel this was the kind of
thing that should be covered by The
Pitt News.

Gladish did admit to putting the
ad in The Pitt News and to placing a
poster over the Tower C elevator on '
Oct. 3!; the poster remained there
from 1:20 a.m. to 8 a.m. that same
morning. Gladish, however, main-
tains that he did not put the circled
ad under the student’s door.

Detective~Walsh of Pitt’s Campus
Police testified at the hearing and
stated in his testimony that Gladish
had previously admitted to putting
the ad under the student’s door.

“There was" not‘a single piece of
concrete evidence besides the ad in
The Pitt News and the poster,” said
Levers. »

Legal counsel for the defense,
Chris Patavini, said one problem in
the case is that “the charge ofthreat-
ening ‘by any means’ is too broad.”

“I think almost anything could be
construed as threatening by any
means; it’s justtoo broad,” Patavini
said. «

“The CBJV evaluates evidence
presented, but there is no way to tell
-who made the phone calls or wrote
anything on walls. They (CBJ) drew ’
assumptions from inferences,’ Pata-

vini said. ’ Charlene Hunter, head of the Campus Judicial Board.

J -Board Offers
Legal Action

. Disputes Within
The University ,
By FREDERICK BEERS

Pitt News Staff Writer
A student with a grievance against

. another student has one course of

legal action at Pitt—the University
Student Judicial System or Judicial
Board.

The Judicial Board is the duly
authorized judicial body having
jurisdiction over all students of the
university. It derives its power from
the board of trustees and exists to
“protect the rights of the student,”
according to its coordinator, Char-
lene Hunter.

The board adjudicates alleged
violations of the Student Code of
Conduct and the Residence Hall
Provisions. A

Actually, there are two judicial
boards—the Residence Hall Judicial
Board and the Campus Judicial

' Board.

The RHJB has jurisdiction over’
residence hall students for offenses.
that occur within the residence halls‘
or on residence hall property, or in-
connection with residence ' hall
activity.

The RHJ B consists of a standing
body of l9 students, any five of
which will constitute the board in
hearing a case.

Sanctions can range from a simple
warning or reprimand to dismissal
and exclusion from the residence

halls. Substitute sanction may also
be imposed, according to Hunter.

The Campus Judicial Board has
jurisdiction over all students for vio-
lations of the Student Code of Con-
duct. lt has l5 members, any five of
which may hear a case.

lts sanctions range also from a
disciplinary reprimand or warning
:0 dismissal from the university.

Hunter determines which board
will hear a particular case.

According to the USJS, upon the
ﬁling of a complaint, the defendant

J-Board Hearing

“To be convicted, there has to be
‘clear and convincing evidence’ lead-
ing to it, but the prosecution can
infer in a gap. If there seems that a
logical sequence of events could

_ occur--they did occur,” he said.

Charlene Hunter, head of CBJ,
explained the procedure but could
not comment on the actual hearing.

“Hearsay is admissable as evi-
dence, double hearsay is not,” Hun-
ter said.

“l charge the Board with their
responsibility and they must be con-
vinced by clear and convincing evi-
dence. If not clearly convinced, they
must find the defendant innocent,”
Hunter explained. .

But Patavini said, “The evidence
is tenuous; they collected a certain
amount, put it together, and made
assumptions. '

“What we have is abstract com-
munications and an abstract pos-

ter,” he said. “As long as no name is
used, you shouldn't be penalized for
such an abstraction.”

“I admitted to the ad and posters,’
Gladish said. “By proof ofinference
they reached a guilty verdict. Walsh
said l put the ad under the door; he

The hearing was to have taken
place on two different dates, but was
postponed both times until Feb. IO.

“October to February is a hell ofa
long time,” said Levers, “and in that
time Walsh could have got his infor-
mation mixed up.”

The reading of one’s rights is a
privilege the university grants.
According to the defendants and
Patavini, Levers was never read his
rights.

“Walsh came to me and told me
nothing was going to happen to me,”
maintained Levers, “so I volun-

1

teered all the evidence. They’d have _

never known who put the ad in The
Pitt News if I hadn't told them.
Walsh got the information under
false pretenses.”

“l investigated the report. I
advised Alan (-Gladish) what would
happen and that he should get an
attorney,” Walsh said.

According to the complaint,‘

Walsh’s investigation report was one
of the writings used at the hearing
when Walsh testified.

Levers said it was a little unjust
that all three ofthem should be con-
victed the same when they were not
all involved in the same way. Levers
let his box number be used in the ad,
Kanaitis helped_Gladish put up the
poster and Gladish placed the ad in
the paper. Because they were found
guilty, there are sanctions placed
against them equally. They were all
put on probation until graduation.

‘‘It was a running joke. With the

continued from page one

ad and the poster we just made it
more abstract,” Gladish said. “We
intended no harm.” '

The student and the defendants
did not know each other prior to the
incident.

“l don't know,” said Gladish.
“The hearing took four hours, and in
some ways, it just made no sense.”

“l’m upset. Before the hearing, the
sanctions were even harder, includ-
ing a formal apology and being out
of housing for a time. After four
hours and all this trouble, it doesn’t
make much sense," Levers said.

“I guess my main complaint is the
system,” Patavini said. “The term
‘by anyjmeans’ is too broad and con-
viction can be arrived at by inferen-
ces and assumptions.”

Class Attends Service for Dostoevsky

B_y MIKE LYCZKO
Pill News Sloli Wriler

Students in the honors course,
UHP Dostoevsky l36, experienced
a glimpse into one ofthe major influ-
ences in Russian writer Fyodor Dos-
toevsky‘s life last night.

The students attended a short
requiem service at St. John the Bap-
tist Orthodox Church in New Ken-
sington to mark the l00th
anniversary of his death.

The service was the idea of the
course instructor, Dr. Patricia Kraf-
cik, who is an Orthodox Christian.
She said that “part ofthe philosophy
of an honors course is to bring in
other experiences related to the sub-
ject. I thought it important to attend
a service _in an Orthodox Church to

experience a similar atmosphere to
what Dostoevsky knew and loved.

“Dostoevsky was a devout
Orthodox Christian who was
steeped in the spiritual life of the
church which was obviously impor-
tant to his artistic work."

His inajor novels include “Crime
and Punishment,” “The Idiot,” and
“The Brothers Karamazov." A shor-
ter work is his famous “Notes from
Underground." Krafcik said he is
best known for his “novel-tragedies”
and that he is signiﬁcant because of
the “intense manner with which he
deals with the eternal questions of
human existence.”

‘ Studying Dostoevsky would be 1

interesting to any person “asking the
same type of questions” about the
meaning of life, said-Dr. Krafcik.

“Students can find a- challenge in
Dostoevsky because he can be read
on many levels-artistic, religious,
political." \

Dostoevsky “evolved politically.”
He spent ten years in Siberia as a
young man after being arrested for
revolutionary activity. After the
imprisonment, “a new Dostoevsky
emerged, the mature Dostoevsky

who would never lose-his sense of ~

social concern," _Krafcik said.

 

Krafcik explainedthat the philo-
sophical_nature of Dostoevsky has
various interpretations.

“He has often been read as an
early Existentialist writer; in some
ways he was an inspiration for the

'Existentialists,” she said.

“in fact, the interpretation of
Dostoevsky as an. Existentialist
comes from a narrow reading of his
work. He does not leave us without a
hope for the future of humanity. V

“His perspective is a religious one.
He examines people of the mid-19th

1 century whom he feels have lost _

touch with ‘living life.’

“The center for his hope for the
future. . .is his image of Christ
which emerges from his novels.

“He came to believe in the messia-
nic role of Czarist Russia as an inte-
gral part'of his’ Christianity.”

Dr. Krafcik said that Dostoevsky
“can’t be easily defined. His great-
ness in so many things, makes him
interesting to people of all ages.”

A P i t t C o m m u t e r s F a c e Difficulties

Vt,"

 

By LYNN THOMAS

One would think that Pittsburgh
potholes and Oakland parking were
enough of a “challenge" for Pitt
commuters. Compared to what is in
store for them, that has been only an
acid test. ‘

With the closing of the Schenley
Park and Panther Hollow Bridges
on Jan. 20, due to the brittleness of

I the steel, Squirrel Hill, Homestead,
-and West- Mifﬂin commuters have

been forced to ﬁnd alternative
routes into Oakland.

These bridges are closed to all
pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The
main detour for these commuters is
the Parkway East. This situation
will continue until sometime this
spring or early summer. Atithis
vague date, the Parkway East will be
closed for reconstruction and the
Schenley Park and Panther Hollow
Bridges will be reopened. These two
bridges will remain open until the
repairs on the Parkway are com-
pleted. Once this is accomplished-
and the Parkway reopens, the
Schenley Park and Panther Hollow

Bridges will reclose indefinitely, to

be rebuilt.
During the period of the Park-

way’s reconstruction, the flow of
traffic wil be moved to one side and
narrowed into one lane for each
direction. The loss of two lanes of
traffic wil naturally increase the con-
gestion of the already choking
highway.

In hopes of easing this confusion,
there are plans to try to enforce a
three-person minimum per car at
Stanwix and Monroeville exits.
There will be police stationed at
these exits who will supposedly
refuse access to, ticket, or verbally
reprimand any auto that is occupied
by less than three people. Ah! The
joys of commuting! To ad insult to
injury, there are plans to close the
Forbes Avenue Bridge hopefully,
repear, hopefully, after the Schenley
Park and Panther Hollow Bridges
are reopened.

Take heart ye persecuted commu-
ter, there is someone out there who
cares. The Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee at Pitt is sensitive to the plight
and ﬂight of the commuter. Organ-
ized about four years ago, the Com-
mittee has been trying to integrate

the commuter and campus.

To ease the commuters’ flight, the
Commuters Affairs Committee is
organizing a car pool program for
the university. They have received
this ‘program from “Share A Ride“
located in Washington, D.C. Each
student will be mailed a question-
naire asking for their name, address
and other relevant information.
Once all the questionnaires have
been returned to Pitt, "this data will
be fed into a computer which will
produce car pool possibilities for the
student population. lf all goes well,
the program will be in effect before
the Parkway closes.

In regards to the commuters’

' plight, the Committee has created

The Commuter Bandit. No, he
doesn’t shoot Meter Maids but he

— does try to prevent parking tickets.

If the Bandit spots an expired meter,
he’ll happily feed the hungry thing
and leave a little note explaining his
actions and
Committee.

If you have never heard of the

Jack Daniel’s Pays

PITTSBURGH:

Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.,
Kentucky-based makers of Jack
Daniels and other whiskies, agreed
to plead guilty to 20 misdemeanor
counts and pay $730,000 to settle
allegations of bribery and mail
fraud, the U.S. Attorney‘s ofice
announced Tuesday.

Assistant U.S Attorney Ed
Schwabenland said the 20-count
information filed Tuesday and the
plea agreement concern payments
by Brown-Forman employees to
trade buyers and retailers, including
package store employees on military
installations in Pennsylvania. The
payments, made between 1971 and
August I977, were to induce sales of
Brown-Forman products over other
products, he said.

The company also agreed to pay
$20,000 in fines on the misdemeanor
counts, the prosecutor's office said.

and “The Elephant Man," the real-
life story ofa freak in Victorian Eng-
land, won top honors in the 53rd
Academy Award nominations Tues-
day, scoring in eight categories each.

“Coal Miner’s Daughter," the
story of Loretta Lynn’s rise to coun-
try music stardom, received seven
nominations, followed by “Fame,”
“Ordinary People," and “Tess" with
six apiece.

“Fame,” the story of young people
attending a performing arts high
school was released early in I980
and was something ofa surprise with
its good showing. “Ordinary Peo-
ple,” on the othere hand, had been
expected to make an even stronger
showing, but it figured where it
counts--in the major categories.

By contrast, “The Empire Strikes
Back," by far the biggest money-
maker of the year, managed to col-
lect only three minor nominations.

Oddly, two of the nominees for
best picture were photographed in
black and white for purposes of

mood-“Raging Bull” and“The Ele-
phant Man." Also listed for the top

prize: “Ordinary People,” “Coal 

Miner's Daughter” and “Tess."

The best-actor nominees were all
strong performers in bravura
performances:

-Robert DeNiro as Jake La Motta
in “Raging BuIl”—-a role for which he
put on 70 pounds during the filming
so he could portray the boxer in his
declining years.

-Robert Duvall as the hard-bitten
wing commander raising his family
in a small Southern town in “The
Great Santini.”

-John Hurt, who portrayed
Robert Merrick, a grossly deformed

man struggling for dignity in “The I

Elephant Man."

-Jack Lemmon as a show business
publicist who maintains his bravado
although he knows he is dying in
“Tribute.”

-Peter O’Toole as a manipulative
director who tricks a novice into tak-
ing unbelievable risks in “The Stunt
Man,”

Ackerman was born in Wauke-
gan, lllinois. Her family later moved
to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where
her father bought a McDonald’s
hamburger franchise. She began
writing limericks at age eight. Even

‘at this early age Ackerman wanted
to be a writer.

“l was constantly writing,” she
said. “I tried to write a novel when l
was eleven but I realized that l didn‘t
know enough about life.”

She believes that it took her par-
ents a long time to adjust to the idea
of her being a writer. They hoped
that she would become a physiologi-
cal psychologist.

“Now, of course, they're terribly
proud of my being a doctor." she
said. “I tell them that l‘m merely a
physician of the soul."

She cannot set bones but her par-
ents believe the label means as much.

“My mother is wickedly proud of
me and since I've been publishing
both of my parents bore their friends
to death.“

Ackerman graduated from Penn
State University with a B.A. degree
in English. She then transferred to
Cornell University where she earned’
three more degrees: M.A. in English;
M.F.A. (Master of Fine Arts) in
Creative Writing; and Ph.D. in Eng-

lish. It was at Cornell that Acker-
man did the research for her first
book of poems entitled, “The

Planets: A Cosmic Pastoral." She

received a Rockefeller grant to study
the planets within the space sciences
department.

“It was this experience that
inspired me to write this suite of
poems based on the current findings
in Planetary Astronomy.”

Although her next collection of
poems, “Wife of Light," includes an
old-fashioned love ode to the extra-
terrestial, it contains very few
science poems.

The poems that she writes now
have little science in them but reflect
ongoing, serious interest in all oflife.

“l’ve never thought of nature as
something that includes cornfields
and trees and excludes amino acids
and quasors-—it’s all nature to me,”
she said.’ \,

Ackerman recently finished a
prose memoir called, “Twilight of
the Tenderfoot." It is based on the
time she spent on a cattle ranch in
New Mexico. Ackerman’s real life
experiences appear throughout her
work. - O ‘

‘‘In order to keep my Protestant
ethic intact, I usually end up writing
about my adventures," she
explained. _,

Although her experiences inspire
her work, it is Wallace Stevens and

Another key influence in Diane
Ackerman’s life is -novelist Paul
West. ,

“He‘s been my toughest, most
unmerciful critic and also my grea-
test support and encouragement.”
West, Ackerman’s companion often
years, has stimulated her poetry
through his own “extremely pyro-
technical and supple prose style.”
She finds it useful to have someone
whose taste can be trusted and she
finds this trust in West.

The only time Ackerman is not '

totally devoted to writing.is when
she is teaching. She teaches only
four months out of the year.

Ackerman, herself, feels permain-< 
ently startled by the world. She said, i_

her finest inspiration “is just being

dents to view the world with a “pas-
sionate curiosity." And she practices
what she teaches.

Opinion A

.   HALF-HEARTED

 ATTEMPTSL

The current visitation policy will stand, Pitt’s board
of trustees recently declared. But, the reasoning
behind this decision won’t. '

The trustees reached their conclusions after hearing
recommendations from the Vice Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs Conney Kimbo and Senior Vice Chancel-
lor for administration Jack Freeman. Kimbo and
Freeman advocated continuing the current policy
based on the results ofa recent survey on residence hall V

V security and privacy.

The difficulty with the administrative recommenda-

tions and the trustee’s declaration begins with the
justification for such a decision—the survey.

The report on a study of Pitt’s Visitation Policywas
issued to Kimbo Jan. 19 by the Institute for Higher
Education. Sixty-five undergraduate resident students
were interviewed for the study; 15 of the 65 were
members of the Inter-Residence Board, the student
governing body for the residence halls. The other 50
students were selected at random from certain'res1-
dence halls. Resident assistants and desk attendants
also participated in the survey. _

“The concensus seems to be that the Visitation Pol-
icy has not had much effect on daytime activity in the

residence halls, but that the guest regulations have

both reduced the number of overnight guests and
enhanced resident’s privacy.,.,” the report of the study
stated. » ’

Before accepting the conclusions of this survey, sev-
eral aspects of the survey should be kept in mind:

——There are approximately 4500 residence hall stu-
dents. Sixty-fi_ve were polled. .

—One survey ‘result not mentioned by the adminis-
trators or the trustees was the changes students sug-
gested for making the Visitation Policy more effective.
The majority of undergraduate residents suggested
allowing overnight guests of the opposite sex with a
roommate’s approval, or for single-room residents.

——The Resident Student Association has expressed

Elie lﬂttt1\5'2m5

Page 6—Wednesday, February 18, 1981

dissatisfaction with the survey questions. An example:
“The current Visitation Policy requirement to secure
written approval of the roommate for an overnight
guest has enhanced the resident’s privacy,” Possible
answers: strongly agree, agree with reservations,
strongly disagree, disagree with reservations, insuffi-
cient knowledge to make judgement.

These examples indicate the survey results should

' not have been so easily accepted.

4 Polling 65 residents seems hardly representative.
‘The questions themselves are too ambiguous. Also,
suggestions of a majority of the students surveyed were
ignored. ~ ~

The Visitation Policy regulations‘ undoubtedly
improve security and enhance privacy to a degree, but
this does not justify closing avenues for improvement
or alteration. .

Would allowing overnight guests_of the opposite sex,
in the residence halls pose such a serious threat to

safety that administrators and trustees refused to con-

sider a policy? Or was accepting the study results at
face value_an easier route than conducting a compre-
hensive, in-depth study of the effectiveness and short-
comings of the Visitation Policy regulations?

If the administration and the trustees are genuinely
concerned about the security of Pitt’s residence halls,
they would make more than this half-hearted attempt
at determining the quality of dorm life at Pitt. '

Q. What are the chances of my
girlfriend .getting pregnant from
having sexual intercourse without a
contraceptive measure during her
menstrual period? P

1-" Worried in Tower C"

A.’ 'First of all, you are taking a _

chance. She can get pregnant during
her menstrual cycle although the

. possibility is slim: ’

Contraception occurs when the

V sperm and egg have an opportunity

to meet. in most women, the egg is

 ii released midway between her men-
P S1_fUal,' cycle‘ (ovulation).  For-

    

instance. if a woman has a 28 day
menstrual cycle, the egg is probably
released around the l4th day. As a

result, most women are more likely ~

to conceive between periods, that is,
at the midpoint in their cycles. Since
ovulation (which determines cycle
length) varies from individual to
individual, it is possible that an egg
could be available to be fertilized at
ANY TIME. The chance of preg-
nancy during the first five days of the
menstrual period is remote,-but
females who have short cycles or
irregular cycles might conceive at
that time.

Q. Can you get crabs from toilet
seats and what can I do if I have
crabs? ~

-U. Nivers. Senior

A. There is no immunity from
pubic lice (crabs). Symptoms vary
from person to person. Some people

do not experience any symptoms’

while others notice severe itching.
Scratching does n_ot bring relief but
can act as a source of transmission
by carrying the pubic lice on the fin-
gers to other hairyvparts of the body

,such as the thighs, underarms, and

head. ‘Pubic lice are usually trans-

mitted from person touperson by
' . dlT¢Cl.,1Physical' ¢9ntact.(i.e. sharings:

 

beds, sharing sleeping bags, and sex- _

ual intercourse). Chances are remote
of getting crabs from a toilet seat.

The life cycle of public lice is
about 30 days, during which time the
female produces 5-l0 eggs daily. A
female can lay as many as 300 eggs
during her lifetime. These eggs are.
deposited at the base of the pubic
hairs. They are grey-whitish in color
and hatch in about a week’s time
into ny_rnphs.\The eggs are hard and
can beffelt more easily than sen. ln
aproxiinately 3 weeks time, the
nymphs mature into an adult and
the female starts to lay eggs.

H L Diagnosis is made by  the‘
lice or their eggs a-ttached_".‘_to the

' pubic hairs. In addition. the individ-

ual may notice brown ﬂeeks"in
his/her underwear. A

The pubic lice and their eggs are
not affected by normal soap, but
they can be killed by some over the
counter preparations such as RID, _
and by prescription preparations,
such as. Kwell. Treatment brings
rapid‘ relief from the itching. Addi-
tional steps are important in order to
minimize the chance of possible

reinfestatio'n.. After trea;tment._ the _
person!..sh_ould'7l;h A ' ' ' ‘E "  '

      

change of clean clothing. Since-the
lice die soon after being eparated
from the body, clothing that has not
been wornfor. more than 24 hours
can be worn without fear of repeated
infestation. Thoroughly wash all '
personal clothing, bed clothes and
bedding of the infested person in hot
water or by dry cleaning. '

One last_ p_oint: Lice can spread
very rapidly. If you or someone you
know gets crabs, don’t be embar-
rassed, just get rid of them.

Q. Should men do a-imonthly‘

check on their genitals? ,' ' ~

A. Yes. ‘According to the Arnleri-V

can Cancel’ Society. .‘-‘testicular tum-

ors‘ ~are':‘:ri|‘ot a, common type "of '
malignancy. They only~account.for ‘

about l%f7of malignancies" in the
male. These tumors are more com-
mon within’ the white race, yet the

~ reason is’il"nl<nown.....The exact rea- ,

son that one devclopes a testicular‘
tumor is unknowﬁ. It is recognized
that a testicle_that has not assumed
its normal position in the scrotum

prior to I0 years ofage is more prone . '

to develop this problem. Some peo-
ple _feel_that a testicle that has been

   

Tinjured ism_o‘re‘,likely_:tottdevelop a 

 

idence to support this statement.‘

Heredity“ or genetic background
may have some inﬂuence which may
explain why testicular tumors are
uncommon in blacks and orientals.

"The roleof hormones is not known,
yet it has been shown that testicular 1'

tumors can be induced in laboratory
animals with the use of hormones."

“There have been many dramatic
improvements in the treatment of
testicular ‘tumors in the past several
years. Of course, the best cure rate is
noted when the tumor is found at a
very early stage.-This is why it is
important for allemen to examine‘

their testicles at frequent i_n_ter_vals.”-

Panthers Lose to Duquesne, 66-646

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Sports Writer
North Carolina and Maryland

were the main attractions last Sun-
day on national television, but don’t
tell that to the l5,824 fans who
packed the Civic Arena to watch
another basketball game. The sel-
lout crowd was not disappointed
with its trip to the Arena as
Duquesne edged Pitt 66-64 in yet
another exciting game between these
intracity rivals.’

It could have been much worse for
Pitt; it could have been a blowout.
But then again, this is Pitt-
Duquesne. Even though the Dukes
held two l9-point leads, Pitt con-
tinued tostorm back. lt wasn’t until
Carlton Neverson’s desperation
heave with one second left, which
sailed awry, that the Dukes could
claim victory.

Coach Roy Chipman was proud
of his team.

“Duquesne played good basket-
ball, but l’m very proud of the team
for comming back like they did,”
Chipman said.

And when it was finally over, the
Dukes held an 8-3 league record and
clinched the home court advantage
for the Eastern Eight tournament.
The Panthers, meanwhile, fell to 5-4
in the league, and a home court can
only be had if they win their remain-
ing games.

lt was that important a game.

For a while it looked as if every-
thing might go Pitt’s way as the Pan-
thers ran off to a 16-9 lead.
Duquesne seemed in trouble when
Duquesne coach Mike Rice called a
timeout to talk to his troops. lfthere

was a key to this game, it might have
been right here, because Rice’s men
came out storming.

Duquesne, after the timeout,
scored l7 unanswered points and
made a shambles of Pitt's proud I-3-
l defense. All season long, while
every facet of the Panthers‘ game
was falling apart at one time or
‘another, the defense remained
strong. It kept them close in ball

games when their shooting was non-
existent; it created everything. And
now it was gone.

Instead of trying to beat the zone
by going over it (as Maryland unsuc-
cessfully attempted), the Dukes fed
their wings. The wings then gave the
ball to either Bruce Atkins or'John
Moore down low against 6-foot-2
Dwayne Wallace, who handles the
back line on that zone. The strategy
did what it set out to do: take Never-
son out of defensive picture and get
the ball inside to the big men.

The Panthers called a timeout» to
regroup and probably to shore up
the middle of their zone. Anticipat-
ing this move, Dukes’ coach Rice
changed his lineup by putting in
Joey Meyers and Barnett Harris,
two sharpshooters to fill it up from
the outside. And put it up they did as
they canned l2 points on just eight
shots. Their contributions led to a
4l-25 Duquesne advantage at
halftime. * .

However, the game was far from
over, and Rice knew that all too
well. ‘

“l told them at halftime to go out
and blow them away," the Dukes’
coach said.. “No lead is safe in this
game."

His halftime talk seemed to work
as his Dukes continued where they
left off, running up I9-point leads
twice. But leads are never safe in a
Pitt-Duquesne game. Of course, the
Panthers needed some help to come
back, and Rice provided it. With his
offense doing so well, Rice ordered a
freeze of the ball with nine minutes
to go. Although Rice wanted to
shave some seconds off the clock, he
ended up destroying his team’s
momentum.

The opportunistic Panthers
jumped on the chance by slowly cut-
ting into the lead on the strength of
several jumpers by Clyde Vaughn,
who, along with Lennie McMillian,
led Pitt with 14 points. With four
minutes to go the lead was 12. Chi-
pman then inserted Darrell Gissen-
danner for a temporarily injured

It was a cliff-hanger. It was a barn-burner. It was a
back-yard brawl. It was the second meeting of Pitt-
Duquesne this season. Webster's dictionary defines

condition of being a rival or rivals; competition.”

The Civic Arena was packed to its domed roof with
l5,824 screaming fans who watched the Dukes win
66-64. What those people probably expected of this
rivalry did not come to pass; a typical clash that would
be close throughout. What actually occured was three
different ballgames.

Game one had the Panthers begin quickly, owning
the first eight minutes of the game. Pitt took charge
with a seven point lead, I6-9.

Game two started with a Duquesne time—out with
12:24 remaining in the first half. Coach Mike Rice got
his troops straightened out and the Dukes ran off a
remarkable streak, outscoring the Panthers 32-9. Thus
. game two ended at halftime with Duquesne leading the
game 41-25. ‘

That lead went even higher, to 19 points at 50-3|,
and game three was underway. Those who thought
that the battle was hopelessly lost had never been to a
Pitt-Duquesne encounter. The Panthers, with their

zone defense--managed to make a game of it with a

rousing last ditch effort.

a Duquesne made the mistake of falling back into a

delay offense too soon, which Pitt was-able to take

advantage of. There was no quit in the Panthers. ‘After
’ a few steals and Duquesne turnovers, the deﬁcit was

Trouble still remained, however. Clancy had fqur V

of the basket, and Duquesne able to get inside against

Clancy fouled out a minute later and coach Roy
Chipman began frantically using player substitutions
to find the right combination for success.'As each

A player checked in and out, it was becoming evident just

how much this basketball game meant to Pitt.

Clyde Vaughn was able to hit a few key jumpers
down the stretch to keep Pitt in the hunt. Darrell
Gissendanner played a highly emotional game in the
last ‘three minutes. Wallace tried to find the solution to
his shots just barely missing despite being injured
toward the end of thegame.

Wallace, when driving for a lay-up in closing min-

utes, was submarined by a Duquesne player and"

landed hard on the court. His leg hurt but the expres-
sion on his face when Chipman tried to pull him out of

the game was one of determination to help his team .

mg his Duquesne counterpart an inch of breathing
room. When Wallace was ready; to return, Gissen-
danner jumped into the air in disgust. When he sat
down on the bench, he yelled to Chipman, “Let me
play, let me play.”

Vaughn was juggled in and outof the line-up during
the furiouslast few minutes’, and he _hit the long range
bombs Pitt needed to stay in it. He wanted the basket-
ball for a possible last second shot that would tie or
win the game. ' ‘ .

Carlton Neverson’s determination may .have been

his downfall. Pitt ran several. successful fast breaks.

wherer‘Neverson_was:the lead man. Twice he lost the
ball out-of-bounds in his hast to sink the shot. He also
had a chance to send‘ the game into over—time with a

‘last second prayer from over 40 feet out that fell short

at the buzzer. ..

‘ Despite the adversity; playing without team-leader
Clancy, being down by as many as 19 points, and not
really playing a fundamentallysound basketball game;
the spirit ‘of the rivalry was enough to keep the game
close. -

Without trying to make it seemrlike a moral victory

for the Panthers, which it was not, the team displayed a

a lot of character. .
Chipman said after the game, “We came back well-
'...and gave a great effort: I’m proud of them.”

Pcmtherettes Are Looking Good forEastems

By SEAN BARNES

- Pill News Sports Writer

Coach Dick Bradshaw’s Pan-
therette swim team made it two-for-
two last week, defeating Eastern
champion Princeton 88-43 Monday
and almost repeating that score Sat-
urday when they beat the third-best
Eastern power, Syracuse, 85-45. The
Pantherettes showed their strength
and depth in both meets with strong
finishes in the second and third pla-
ces.

Pitt’s win over last year’s Eastern
Champ, the Princeton Tigers, could

' be forecasted after just three events

as Pitt took a commanding lead of
23-2. Sue Heon swam the first two
events and powered to a first in both
the 400-yard medley relay and the
500—yard freestyle. The 400 medley

relay time of 3:56.74 ranks the relay

team of Heon, Jan Ujevich, Nancy
Henry and Amy Jackson ninth in

the nation. Heon went on to also win A

the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-

V yard backstroke. Heon’s win in the

200 back was an upset for Prince-
ton’s Chun, ranked 14th nationally.

Another upseet came in the 200
IM when Pitt’s Ujevich defeated
Princeton’s Charlotte Tiedemann,
the fifth fastest 200-yard breast-

stroker in the nation. Tiedemann,
however, won the 100 breast.

In all, Pitt only lost three swim-
ming events. Heon was a triple
winner and Henry and Ujevich each
had double individual wins as well as
being in the winning National-
qualifying 400 medley relay.

The only low point of the meet
came unexpectedly in two events in:
which Pitt usually cleans up— the
one and three—meter diving. A pre-
pared Princeton diving team won
both boards to the dismay of Pitt
diving coach Julian Krug. “Both
they and we made National cuts on
both boards; their scores were just
higher,” said Krug. “This is a big
improvement over last year’s Prince--
ton diving team.”

The Syracuse meet was an entirely
different story for Krug and his girls.
Pitt swept first, second and third on
both boards with Holly Sluss and
Lisa Huey making National pre-
qualifications on one meter and
Julie DeHaven clearing the National
prequalifying cut on the three meter
board by over a point and a half.

The Pantherette swimmers also
looked impressive in the Syracuse
meet as the team lost only one event.

Both.Ujevich and Henry had double
wins, with Ujevich’s time of 1:06.98
in the 100-yard breaststroke bring-
ing her ranking to l 1th in the nation.
Pitt swept not only one and three-
meter diving but also the 200 and
100-yard butterfly events, with
Henry winning both.
The Pantherette team is now get-
‘ting psyched for Easterns, which will

be held Feb. 26-28. Krug will be
returning this evening with the
women‘s diving team who had
National prequalifications yester-
day and the day before -at Penn
State. All four women divers made
Easterns, and 15 of Pitt’s best
swimmers also qualiﬁed. I

Easterns will be held at Pitt’s
Trees Pool with 20 women’s teams,

ranging from Maine and Brown to
WVU and Princeton. Princeton was
last year’s champ, but Pitt is the
favorite this year. Brown, Penn’
State, West Virginia and Princeton

should prove to be tough competi-

tion for Bradshaw’s Pantherette
squad, but Pitt’s l0-l season record
indicates that the team will be diffi-
cult to surmount.
