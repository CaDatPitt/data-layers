t to meet the Greeks

Members of Sigma Chi and Tau Epsilon Phi were among the fraternity brothers showing off their awards during Tuesday’s Meet the Greeks. Though
the turnout at the event was low, students still interested in joining a fraternity and did. not attend the event can still rush this semester.

Standing in a ballroom Tuesday
night, fraternity boys were dressed
in ties and clean shirts.

But they were not there to meet
girls; instead, _they were seeking
potential members for spring rush.

_ “I think we can handle the
steady rush coming in,” said SGB
President and Lambda Chi brother
Brian Kelly, commenting on the
lack of independents who showed
up for the event.

Each Inter-Fraternity Council
organization had a table situated in

Meet the

posed to last for

because of the

rush being not as

Rush Chair Matt Huchinson

‘explained that Meet the Greeks is

usually held on one night for both
fraternities and sororities, but for

lack of interest-
ed students.

Some Greeks attributed disin-
terest with the Greek Community to
negative stereotypes shown on
MTV’s “Fraternity Life,” while oth-

ers cited that the national average
for Greek involvement is down.

Huchinson said that Meet the

The importance of the relation-

afternoon at a lunch sponsored by
the World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh
Chapter of the American Council on
Germany.

“And to ignore the very, very
deep and substantial economic
interdependence between both con-
tinents — that is against both inter-

 

ests.”

He also made clear the need to ‘

rethink old strategies of defense in
light of the changing tactics of ene-
mies. _

The world, Scharping said, is no
longer organized in a bipolar man-

,-ner, and as such, defense cannot be

Traditional security efforts such
as defense and deterrence will not

the need to be “engaged at the

with a fanatical organization behind
them telling them that they will go
to heaven?” he asked.

Scharping made minimal effort
to disguise the presence of such ten-
sions as the transatlantic disagree-
ment over Iraq, but rather discussed
them in both his speech and as a
response to several of the questions
posed in the period after it.

“What I want to make clear is
that in the comprehensive-sense of
our relationship I hope that our
political leadership understands
that statesmanship is asked. I know
every statesman is a‘ politician, but
sometimes you have to decide ‘what

. do you want to be?”’ he said.

He addressed this comment to
both American politicians and the
German chancellor who, he said,.in
the “crucial time between summer
and Christmas in 2002, acted more
as a political party leader than as a
statesmen.” / A

./Scharping was dismissed by
German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroder in July 2002 for suspected
payments that he received from a
German public relations firm.

Under German law, ministers
are not allowed to receive any pay-
ments outside of their mini-s~t‘eri‘al‘

Emergency provides cares-for civilians wounded in war

MIKE MASLANIK
Staff Writer

“No matter who triggers a war,
the end result will be a catastrophe
for civilians who bear no responsi-
bility for it,” said Dr. Gino Strada,
Pitt alumnus and chief surgeon for
an international medical aid organi-
zation called Emergency.

In a lecture presented by Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public‘ Health
on Wednesday evening, Strada
described Emergency and the
impact the organization has had
throughout the world.

Emergency started in 1995 to
“provide high-standard and free
medical and surgical assistance to
victims of war.” The Milan, Italy
based group first set up shop in
Kurdish northern Iraq in March of
that year. The organization outfitted
local hospitals with free medical
supplies and training to deal with
the frequent injuries involving
landmines and unexploded bombs.

Since ‘ then, Emergency has
established itself in five other coun-
tries, including Cambodia and
Afghanistan. It’s built rehabilitation
centers and plas-
tic surgery clin-

Strada urged those in attendance
to look beyond the numbers and see
the human suffering caused by war.

“The first and most important
thing of all is
that these people

‘ mation. The

bers, mostly

said. “They are
‘not merely col-
lateral damage.”
Strada vehe-
mently spoke
against war, say-
ing, “It’s unbe-
lievable that we

Strada said.

The organization spent about
$16 million last year on various
projects, Strada said. Funding

tions, but the organization does get
money from institutions such as the
European Union.

still use barbar-
ian methods” to
solve international disputes. He
also called for a ban on war,
“because we can’t solvethe prob-
lem of mass graves with more mass
graves.” . ~
Prior to Strada’s lecture, there
was a screening of “Desert

Rainbow,” a half—hour documentary
chronicling Emergency’s work in
Iraq. Juxtaposed against images of
burn victims and double amputees,
were ‘scenes of ‘smiling children and
sweeping landscapes. I

Landmines are one of the
biggest dangers in countries like
Iraq, according to the video. Even
though their use is banned by inter-
national law, landmines account for
20 percent of all civilian casualties.

Against the grim backdrop of
amputee wards, “Desert Rainbow”
showed graduates of Emergency’s
training programs. Emergency pro-
vides theseicourses in sewing, shoe-
making and other trades free of
charge. The idea is to ease victims
back into everyday life.

Emergency’s message is simple,
Strada said, and it boils down to a
basic respect for human life. ”

“With respect and dignity, you
can implement »a basic human
right,” he said. “That is the right to
stay alive.”

volunteer with the station 13 years
ago. A
Batista is‘ an artist and says he
has been one “forever.” He studied
art in college and graduate school,
and he has been a professor at Pitt
since 1978.

After a “freak fall” forced him to
undergo surgery on the arm he uses
for painting, Batista began stuffing
envelopes for WYEP as a volunteer.

“I wanted to give something _
back to the radio station because I
listened to it all the time,” he says.

Once Batista began volunteering
at .WYEP, the program director
talked him into hosting a radio
show.

The “sincerity and virtuosity” of
folk music led Batista to host a folk-
oriented show, he says. .

“It’s not about hiding. It is
music about the people,” Batista
explains.

Sincerity and virtuosity were not
always his priorities in musical‘
choice. _

Like most kids, Batista grew up
listening to the music he heard on
the radio stations, which were main-
ly commercialized.

“The Beatles were my first real
attraction to music,” he says.

It wasn’t until he reached col-
lege that Batista discovered the hid-
den treasure of American music.

He says The was “bitten by the
folk bug” when exposed to John
Hartford’s 1971 release “Steam \
Powered‘Aereo-Plain.”

Since then, folk music has been
one of Batista’s passions.

“It is tough for anyiartist to get
[his] work out there,” Batista says.

As a visual artist, Batista said he
knows the truth of his statement
firsthand. '

EDITORIAL

TheUnion is in astateor divisiveness  

President George W. Bush’s annu-
al State of the Union address, deliv-
ered Tuesday, was a shining example
of the divisive policies of the adminis-
tration thus far.

Just watching the speech on televi-
sion demonstrated the partisan line
drawn in the sand — at many points
throughout the speech, half the cham-
ber stood up and applauded, while the
other half remained seated, grudgingly
clapping or shaking their heads in dis-
belief.

A particularly poignant occurrence
in the great applause divide occurred
when Bush mentioned the USA
PATRIOT Act. He said that key provi-
sions of the act are set to expire this
year. Cue Democrats to stand and
applaud vigorously. Bush then ﬁnished
the thought, saying that the act needed
to be renewed. Cue Republicans to
cheer.

It’s distressing to see such obvious
distaste between the parties, and even
more disturbing to see the President
making no attempt to repair the rift. In
addressing tax cuts, ﬁve sentences
began with “unless you act.” The
rhetoric of division and blame was
made quite clear.

It was interesting to note that Bush
never mentioned his controversial plan
to put humans back on the moon and
eventually Mars. For the President to
gloss over such an important issue

while devoting time to such innocuous
issues as a letter from a ten—year-old
girl and being against steroids was dis-
appointing. , -

The President made it clear that he

. is willing to take the drastic step

toward amending the Constitution to
prevent homosexual marriage from
ever being -recognized, pointing his
finger at “activist judges” taking initia-
tive on the issue and redeﬁning mar-
riage through court order.

p The Supreme Court is part of the
system of checks and balances, ‘Pan
important tenet of democracy as we
know it. If the justices disagree with
the President, it is their duty to speak
up and keep one person’s‘ideas from
becoming law without taking an objec-
tive look at the law as defined in the
Constitution. _ ' ’ .

A large part of Bush’s speech was
devoted to congratulating himself on
achieving his stated. goals, Which, in
fairness, he has. If the President could
devote even a modicum of his consid-
erable effectiveness to creating biparti-
sanship and harmony, the result could
be one of the greatest presidencies in
history. ‘

Instead, the atmosphere in the
chambers of the House was a micro-
cosm of the nation and the world.
Division and an “us vs. them” mental-
ity are the order of the day in America,
and the world at large, unfortunately.

The devil television made me do it

It’s become a cliche in our society
that, whenlife gives you lemons, you
sue the pants off the lemon tree. If
you’ve lived on a diet of McDonald’s
food for most of your life, then wake
up one day to ﬁnd yourself obese —
well, Ronald McDonald is going to

have to pay the piper, because you are_
large and in charge. You’ll wipe the ‘

smirk off that clown’s face.
Reportedly, in some areas of

Afterward, he is attended

room and “make a man

It’s also become
cliche to point out how
gosh—dam silly it is that
people sue for severely
misguided reaspns"—— or
just because they are
bored. That’s like shoot-
ing fat-ass fish in a fry vat;

So I apologize for bringingthis up
again, but I think-these ridiculous law-
suits sometimes have deeper meanings.
Today’s case study is a West Bend,
Wisc. man who wants to sue his cable

company for causing his wife to be '

overweight and his children to be lazy.

Quoted in the Fond du Lac, Wisc.,
Reporter, Timothy Dumouchel says, “I
believe that the reason I smoke and
drink every day and my wife is‘over-
weight is ;;because we watched TV
every day for thelast fouryears.” His
children are also -/_“1azyi channel-
surfers.” As opposed to the active
charmel-surfers-who usually make cap-
tain of the football team.

I can understand Dumouche1’s
lament. If I watched television every

day, smoke and drink would probably
be the only thing keeping me sane. And
my strength would be so sapped that
I’d barely be able to lift the remote. We
all know the feeling you get from
watching too much television — lethar-
gic yet restless; emotionally tired, but

wired at the same time; mentally I

active, but only on a primitive, reptil-
ian level. Like those snakes at the zoo
that only come outside to bask in the
sun, except that we bask in television’s

glow. ' .
' He tried to do some-
thing. He called the cable
company and told them to
disconnect it. But they didnit.
Dumouchel put the television
in the basement, where no one
could watch it, but his wife
hauled it back upstairs. If she
somehow" found the inner
strength to do that, why not
make her daily exercise mov-
ing the television up from the-
basement? Ten or twenty reps
. of that, and you’d blast away
those ﬂabby abs.

, Dumouchel missed that opportuni-
ty, instead making a deal with his wife
that she ‘and the kids could watch until
the cable company disconnected his
service. Despite several calls by the
frantic father, the channels kept corn-
ing. For four years. Meanwhile, the
Dumouchels were held» hostage, pris-
oners of their own entertainment.
There are no reports as to whether they
thought to board up the windows and
doors or turn off the television-

about how many people arein the same

School’s gotten less fun since thesecond grade

Kindergarten was a good time. It
really was. First and ‘second grade
were also pretty fun, as I recall. A
schedule filled with arts and crafts,
story time, and show and tell is prob-
ably as close to the ideal school day
as I have ever seen.

The problems really begin once
elementary school is over. Lectures
become increasingly frequent, useless
facts for memorizing all the more
prevalent, and squares of carpet for
sitting on go sadly extinct.

Most people manage to trudge
their way through a few more years of
education. Even though the luxuries
of grade school have disappeared, stu-
dents are resourceful enough to find
new ways to amuse themselves during
school hours. Some cover their note-
books in ﬂowers, hearts, and scribbles
of “I love Bobby.” Others are busy
dreaming up new plays to bring their
teams to Victory. Some take notes, and
some just fall asleep.

As for me, while‘I’ve done more
than my fair share of napping and
doodling, I have also managed to
compile a list of ten ways in which
school could be made considerably
more interesting. A

10. Take a cue from television
news — catchy slogans and video-
game quality graphics serve to dis-
guise depressing information, so
there’s no reason to think they could-
n’t liven up the classroom, too.

9. To reduce hallway traffic
between classes, build canals and fill
them with gondolas. Not only would
this create the job opportunities so
desperately needed by American,=gon-
doliers, but it would also add an indis-
putable element of multicultural class
to even the dingiest of schools.

8. Instead of giving pop quizzes
about last week’s chapter, give the
kinds of quizzes found on sites like
Live Journal. It is ‘equally, if not more
important to know what vegetable or
‘80s hair band you are most like as it
is to remember trigonometry identi-
ties.

7. To get students excited about
receiving report cards, encase’ end-of-
term grades in fortune cookies before
mailing them home. Even if their
grades aren’t good, at least there’s a
cookie to be eaten.

6. In a tribute to the genius who
was Pee-Wee Herman, and as an
excellent way to build vocabulary,
institute a “word of the day.” Each
time the word is said, everybody gets
to scream at the top of their lungs for

a few seconds.

5. Pipe nicotine through the venti-
lation system. Traditionally, kids
haven’t always wanted to go to
school. Now, they’ll need to.

4. Have “Survivor: Chemistry

Class.” Just about every
other premise for a reality
TV show has already been
produced, and if “Surreal
Life,” a program revolving
around C—list actors and
washed—up child stars, can
reach its second season,
anything can.

3. Hold proper cele-
brations. No birthday is
complete without cup-
cakes or brownies, singing
“Happy Birthday,” and

allowing the child in question to wear
some sort of crown for the day. for a bonfire in a spirit-boosting pep .

Emily Kaufman

 

Columnist

 

Holidays require goodie
bags, games, movies, and
sometimes a chance to
make and distribute cards
for everyone in class.

2. Hold a massive
fund—raiser to buy new
chairs from the Sharper
Image, so that students
have access to six differ-
ent types of massage in
three levels of intensity,
with the option of heat.
The old desk-and-chair

combinations could be used as fuel

rally.

And what, in my opinion, would
do the most good:

1. Replace teachers with Muppets.
I couldn’t stay awake through two
years of U.S. History, but if someone
as furry and loveable as Fozzie Bear
had taught it, things might have been
different.

Emily Kaufman can ’t take credit for
coming up with these fabulous sug-
gestions entirely on her own, and is
really glad she has friends who stay
up as late at night as she does. E-mail
her at edk3 @pitt.edu.

Is physical addiction to television possible?

Hicks, page 8

really watching anything? Afterwards,
do you remember that time? Did it
make you lazy and fat? Probably not,
but would you sue for those hours
back, if you could?

It’s hard to buy Dumouchel’s argu-
ment that he was physically addicted to
television, and harder still to blame the
cable company, who mainlined over
ﬁfty channels into his house for free.
It’s not hard, though, to wonder why
the television occupies the central
space in so many living rooms, or why
people who come home from work

exhausted ﬂip on the television for
another few hours of exhaustion. But
that point has also already been made;
books like Four Arguments for The
Elimination of Television have already
pointed an accusatory finger at the
Couch Potato Nation. National studies
about the “obesity epidemic” blame the
fat of the land on a lack of couch-free
activity; social psychologists whine
that we’ve become a country of cubi-
cle—dwe1ling loners who go home to
TV dinners and reruns of “Law and
Order.”

None of them have proposed any
solutions short of turning back the
clock to a pre—television age. That’s

why it’s up to people like Dumouchel
to lead us out of the darkness and into
the light. It’s an ingenious plan, really.
As compensation for his "overweight
wife and lazy kids, who all got that way
by sitting in front of a screen full of
moving pictures every day, Dumouchel
is asking Carter Cable to give him three
computers and a lifetime of free
Internet service. Presumably so he can
instant message his kids in the other
room and ask how glad they are to have
ﬁnally ditched that demon television.

Jesse Hicks is a big ol’ Luddite. Send

Say What needs to be said
about President Bush

Dear Editor:

I am writing to you today
with a sincere and desperate
request. I read The Pitt News
every morning, and I greatly
respect and enjoy your work.

. However, with the recent State

of the Union by our president; I
wonder why the real message is
not being said. With récent Pitt
News pieces denouncing anti-
abortion arguments, demanding
equal rights for gay couples and
opposing the NRA, I do not
understand why you are afraid
to say what needs to be said.

President Bush represents
the complete opposite of what
is needed to help our country
progress into a free, equal and
fair society. He ignores the gun
and murder problem we have in
this country. He constantly tries
to place further restrictions and
bans on abortions. Bush also
wants to completely outlaw gay
marriages in this country. The
President said that if activist
judges pressed the issue, the
only alternative would be a con-
stitutional amendment to ban
gay marriage. At a time in
which injustice, unemployment
and unhappiness seem to be
growing rapidly’ in this country,
the only proposals that Bush
comes up with are the continua-
tion of our military invasion of
Iraqi and a huge space mission
to the moon and/Mars.

It seems The Pitt News has
publicly refuted all of the con-
tradictory actions and policies
of the Bush administration,

‘However, the real declaration
and publicity needed is nowhere

to be seen. With the "elections
coming soon, now is the time
for action. Tell everyone of the
stupidity and uselessness of
war. Expose the injustice and
harm Bush has caused this
country. And, most importantly,
inform the people of Pitt that
the only way to fight against

these injustices is to.elect ‘a,

president who will fight them
with you.

Kung-fu ﬁghting — and ﬂying

Master of the Flying Guillotine
Starring Jimmy Wang Yu, Kam Kang, Lung
Kum Yee, Sham Tsim Po

Directed by Jimmy Wang Yu

7i‘r7i‘r‘l/2

During the 1970s, martial arts ﬁlms gained popular-
ity among audiences in the United States, the most well
known being those from martial arts master Bruce Lee.
VV1th the 2003 release of Quentin Tarantino’s martial arts
ﬁlm-inﬂuenced,  Bill, Part l,” the director revealed
his -love for the genre, citing the little—known “Master of

the Flying Guillotine” as his favorite. Since its release in
1975, the ﬁlm has been circulated among cult ﬁlm buffs
through the use of bootleg videos containing a damaged
print. Now, after more than 25 long years, the ﬁlm has
been fully restored in an uncut, wide-screen format and
is prepared for re-release. ‘
Directed by martial artist Jimmy Wang Yu, who also
wrote, and starred in the ﬁlm, “Guillotine” takes place in

_ 17th century China, where Fung Sheng Wu Chi, the

blind master of the ﬂying guillotine, sets out to avenge
the deaths of his two disciples. Knowing only that they
were murdered by a man called the One Armed Boxer
(Wang Yu), Fung goes on a killing spree, decapitating
H V  A every one-armed man

that he encounters kon

but to outsmart Fung in a climactic ﬁght to the death.
The inﬂuence “Guillotine” has on more recent mar-
tial arts/fantasy ﬁlms is apparent — in a few scenes, the
One Armed Boxer demonstrates his ability to walk up
walls and “ﬂy.” Unlike its Oscar winning successor
“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” however, the ﬁlm is
not loaded with special effects. Instead, the story of
“Guillotine” depends more on fast—paced, bloody ﬁght
scenes and interesting characters; like the Indian yogi

who can stretch his arms out to twice their length in order '

to choke his opponents. The few special effects
“Guillotine” does have are achieved through quick edit-
ing and cinematography, and sometimes end up looking
cheesy to those accustomed to the ﬂawless look of com-
puterized special effects. , ' '

In the end, “Guillotine” ‘should appeal to an audience ‘ l L

that can appreciate the film’s intentional and uninten-

tional humor. It takes a special type of person to ﬁnd A

humorin eye gouging and decapitation. And unless the
viewer is willing‘ to not take it seriously, heor she may

Recommended if you like:
Nelly Furtado

The members of Moonraker met
while they were all students at vari-
ous schools in Boston in 2000, and
they’ve been making interesting
music ever since. Their music can be
classified as electronica with a heavy
funk inﬂuence, but the thing that’s
most evident in their songs is the fact
that they just want people to get up
and dance. They accomplish this
rather well. Listening to their self-
titled album, you can just see a club
packed with tragically hip twen-

_ tysomethings dancing and trying to.
T decipher their meaningful lyrics.

Singer Kelli Scarr sounds a lot
like Nelly Furtado with a few hints
of Dido thrown in, especiallywhen
she hits breathy, soaring high notes.
On the opening track, “Shalom,”
she’s singing about a former lover
she’s still in love with. Lyrics such

as “Shalom -— till we meet again I
will tellher to wait for you, that

weeping girl at cliff’s edge. Shalom‘

— till we touch again I will tell her
not to run, no, for you are. always
there,” stand out. Toward the end of
the song, she seats in. the manner of
Ella Fitzgerald, which conveys her
confusion at the way the relationship
ended. And at the very end, after the
music stops, she whispers the word

“Shalom,” letting the listener feel’

how heartbroken she is.
The song “Salimander Skin” is

slower and more introspective. In it, A

Scarr adopts apsofter singing style as
she tells us the story of her mother’s
life in lyrics like, “I would sing
myself to sleep while she was in the
next bedroom over. Oh, how many
secrets would she keep? Was she
crying before she knew that he was
lying?” Once again, there is a
tremendous end to the song — Scarr

just lets her voice take off and con- 4

vey the pain she feels in-her tumul-
tuous relationship with her mother.
“Can I Love” is the most dance-
able song on the album. The opening
bass line just grabs you and won’t,let

go until you get up and dance. The
lyrics are playful, with Scarr ques-
tioning the definition .of love and
whether it exists between her and the
person she’s singing to. For example,
she asks, “What’s the deal with love?

Do—I turn to you or do I turn to me? ‘

Can we work it out or should we just
let V it? Yeah,

yeah, can I love? , 3
Can Igive -you ‘
all the stars
above? Someone .
tell me — is this '
love?” ‘ ‘

For this
weekend’s per-
formance in

Pittsburgh,
Moonraker will
certainly ' make
you get up and
dance to their
unique blend of
funk and elec-
tronica. Be sure
to head out to

cosmically fun
time. I

Moonraker will be performing this .

Worth taking a date to ,

Win a Date with Tad

Hamilton! ’
Starring Topher Grace, Josh
Duhamel, Kate Bosworth,
Ginnifer Goodwin

Directed by Robert Luketic
was

It’s the ultimate Hollywood fantasy:
The chance to hang out with one of the
hottest male actors around would probably
‘get most girls excited. Contests like these
don’t happen often, and a hundred dollar
entrance fee seems like a staggering price to
pay for just a name in a drawing. However,
the entrance fee doesn’t keep Rosalee Futch
(Kate Bosworth) from raising the money
and entering to win a chance for a date with
one of the most popular actors of his day,
Tad Hamilton. Fortunately for her, spending
one hundred dollars on the contest is worth

it, because she wins. Fortimately for us, -

Rosalee’s date with Tad Hamilton sets the

stage for a humorous and entertaining ’

romantic comedy.

Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel) plays
wholesome, respectable, sensitive men in his
romantic movies. On the front of the
tabloids, it’s a different story. This doesn’t

prevent Rosalee and her best friend Cathy
Feely (Ginnifer Goodwin) from idolizing

him and talking about their favorite movie ,

star non—stop, much to the disdain of their
other best ' ﬁiend Pete Monash (Topher
Grace). After Tad’s agents concoct the con-
test and Tad has his date with Rosalee, he
decides he wants her “goodness” to rub off
on him, so he follows her back to her home-
town in West Virginia. _

The plot is pretty straightforward, wiﬂr a

slight twist on the story for most romantic ,

comedies. What makes “Win a Date with
Tad Hamilton” stand out from the others is
the charisma of all the young stars on screen.
Josh Duhamel plays a convincing
Hollywood leading man despite the fact that
this is his first feature ﬁlm role. Kate
Bosworth is perfect to play the pretty, sweet,
slightly naive girl who’s torn between the
movie star and her best guy friend Topher
 steals the show whenever. he’s on
screen. The quiet, sarcastic hurrror he brings
to the ﬁlm is more humorous than any of the
other big, sweeping jokes. After a short
while, it’s obvious whom the audience will
wanttorootfor. — T G "V ' ;

. Notgonly do the interactions, between
ﬂre characters keep the movie in the funny’
zone, p the silly characterizations of
Hollywood life vs. small-town living creates
a nice dynamic. Nothing is overdone, and

' gags are not ‘run into the ground. The plot of l

the ﬁlm moves in a natural way. As with any
good’ romantic comedy, there are touching

' moments and sad moments ‘and moments
ﬁlled withtension when it’s not clear'if the V

character will do” the right thing. Even
‘though it’s apparent. that everything will
work out in the end, ﬂre journey to this neat

conclusion is neither boring nor predictable.

It’s a very amusing and fun story that’ll def—
initely keep the attention of those who are a
fan of these types of movies, and probably a
few that are not.

“Win a Date with Tad Hamilton’_’ takes
the common fantasy of a dream date come
true and makes it into a ﬁlm that can be clas-
siﬁed as a good time. The actors and the
story work well together to make this an
entertaining and charming movie. For a
lighthearted, feel—good winter romantic
comedy this ﬁlm is a winner.

“Win a Date with Tad Hamilton” opens in
theaters Friday.

Old favorites and new faces double up

Mario Kart: Double Dashll
Developed by.Nintendo

It’s a fact of life, an immutable truth
that holds the world upon its shoulders. It
is the kind of truth on which civilizations
are built, on which mountains stand, on
which life as we know it balances like a
tightrope walker on ﬁshing line.

If there’s a new Nintendo system, it
will have a Mario Kart.

So far, this has yet to be a bad thing.
It seems that people will never get tired
of racing around Nintendo locales, pit-
ting classic Nintendo stars against each
other in an 8—man/woman/fungus match-
up. However, “Mario Kart: Double
Dash! 1” goes a bit further by extend-
ing the ﬁeld to 16 competitors and
putting them into two-man cars.
With this deviation comes sev-
eral layers of team—building
strategy, sure to add another
level of complexity to the
familiar, comfortable “Mario
Kart” experience.

Apart from this, “Double

expect it would. The controls are

Andrew and Peter Cash are two
brothers who, after being separated

in 1997. Musically speaking, that is.

Before then, both of the Canadian-

careers in genres much different from
one another. Andrew played political-

L’etranger and then formed his own
band, Ursula, after L’ etranger broke
up in 1986. Meanwhile, Peter played

a combination. Each of the Cash,

Brothers brings their own style to their
music. But it was the more folksy
melodies of Peter Cash that won out
‘ on their first Rounder Records release,
How Was Tomorr0w?.

And with the 2003 release of their

the brothers are moving away from
alt—country roots and showing that
they can be edgy and contemporary

  Kunich’s A return gives Panthers a lift

A. MAIT MILQSZEWSKI
‘ _ Staff Writer

‘ How many teams play well without
their leader? ‘ '

That is a difficult feat toy accom-

plish, yet the Pitt Panthers’ women’s

basketball team has been doing justthat‘

for the past 11 games. .

Amy Kunich, the Panthers’ starting
point guard and team leader, had been
sidelined since suffering a stress ‘frac-
ture in her foot in early December.

“She was our starting point guard,
and she is our heart and sou ,” said
Panther head coach Agnus Berenato.
“We covered for [Kunich] while she
was gone, but we are glad that she is
back.’.' "

Over the stretch when Kunich was
out, the Panthers went 5-6, with fresh-

man Brooke Hughes taking over the
point guard‘ duties.

On Wednesday night, Kunich
returned. After a slow start against No.
23-ranked Virginia Tech, Kunich began
to find her game ‘again.

“ I was excited to come back and

play, but it was a good learning experi-
ence to watch from the bench,” she said.
“It’s hard to sit there -and Watch, but it
feels great to be bac .”

Kunich added to a’ veryvimportant 9-
0 run by hitting a key three pointer in
the first half. The three marked
Kunich’s first points back, in an excite-
ment-ﬁlled first-half retum. '

“I wasn’t really nervous; if anything

I was too excited with all the adrena--_
line,” Kunich» said, “I just wanted to

play hard..I did not know what was

‘ going to happen; it was my ﬁrstlgame

back after 11 games off. I didn’t feel
nervous — less nervous than the ﬁrst
game of the season.”

The lead was short lived, but
Kunich’s return was not. During the sec-
ondhalf, the Panthers battled with the
higher ranked Hokies, getting a big con-
tribution from sophomore Katie I-listed.
Histed, a- backcourt mate of Kunich,
was happy to see her point guard back,
and showed it with a career—high 19
points while coming off the bench;

, “It was great to have Amy back,”
Histed said. “There was one time, dur-
ing a dead hall, where she got our team«
together, and told each one of us where.
to go and what to do. She is our coach,

During President, Bush’s
speech, he dropped a bomb when
calling for all athletes and pro
leagues to stop the use ‘of all
steroids and performance-enhanc-
ing drugs. .
“The use of performance-
enhancing drugs, like steroids, in

baseball, football and other sports

sends the wrong message [to
America’s youth]: that there are
accomplishment,”
President Bush said, adding, “and
that performance is more important
than character.”

The statement was followed by
loud applause throughout Congress,
but not around the pro leagues.

The league’s lack of applause
does not mean they approve of
steroids and performance-enhanc-

Coaching moves from within make little sense

VEEW

  
 

S P 0   LI;

 

After weeks of speculation and
potential turnover, the Steelers’

offensive coaching, staff is finally.‘

starting to shape up for 2004.

After former Pittsburgh offen-
sive coordinator Mike Mularkey
skipped town last week to assume
the ‘head coaching responsibilities
for the Buffalo Bills, and current
Steelers offensive line coach Russ
Grimm was turned down by the
Chicago Bears after“being named a
finalist for their vacant head coach-
ing position, Bill Cowher had some
important decisions to make.

Rather than ‘conduct a drawn-
out job search'for a new ‘offensive
coordinator, Cowher took a page
from his own book on Tuesday, pro-
moting tight ends coach Ken
Whisenhunt to offensive coordina-
tor. This, of course, is how the
Steelers came up with their last
offensive coordinator, when then-
tight ends coach Mularkey was pro-
moted to offensive coordinator after
Kevin Gilbride was fired in 2000.

' But Cowher didn’t stop there.
Perhaps frightened by the Bears’
interestin Grimm, Cowher promot-
ed him to assistant head coach in

addition to his offensive line coach-»

ing duties.

This all sounds fine and good,
but ‘rthe only problem for the
Steelers. in all of this coaching
roulette is that two of their biggest
weaknesses in‘ 2003’s 6-l0 cam-
paign were their tight ends and their
offensive line. A

, I don’t want to beat a dead
horse, and I know that the Steelers
were banged-up up front all season,
but Pittsburgh’s offensive line was
bad in 2003. I mean, really, really
bad.

Tommy Maddox wasjsacked 41
times in 2003. Among AFCIquarter-
backs, only Drew Bledsoe ended up
on his butt in the. backfield more

times this season. The O-line took 0

15 weeks to open up any holes for
either Amos Zeroue or Jerome
Bettis, and as a result, the Steelers
bested only the Detroit Lions in
rushing yardage.

V The tight ends should have been
a different story. Jay Riemersma
was the biggest off—season free
agent. pickup for the Steelers last

year, but he spent the majority of

the season injured. For a pass-
happy offense, the tight,end combi-
nation of Riemersma, Jerame
Tuman and Mark Bruener caught a
total of only 24 passes for 263 yards
and two touchdowns, hardly gaudy

statistics. And Bruener, one of the

best blocking tight ends in the NFL
throughout his career, was deemed
inactive for the first two games of
the season. -

The Steelers are an organization
that likes to keep it in the family.
They always have been, and for the
most part, this mentality has
-brought them success. But does this

 There are plenty of capable

the Steelers offense next year and
would have killed for a job with a

Panthers pick up two wins

in gymnastics home opener

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Diandra O’ Connor did not need to say
anything to describe the way she felt after
Pitt gymnastics’ home opener last Friday.

The smile that stretched across her face
said it all for her. -

O’ Connor, a senior all—arounder for the
Panthers, recorded her 1,000th career point
and won the all-around with 39.15 points to
help Pitt (194.3 points) defeat North
Carolina State (193.85) and James Madison

Pitt improved to 3-1 overall with the
wins and 2-0 in the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League, and O’Connor became
the -14th gymnast in school history to reach
the l,000th point plateau.

‘Tm excited,” O’Connor said about her
milestone and about how close the ﬁnal
score was. “At the end, we didn’t know the

outcome, but we knew it was going to be.

Going into the ﬂoor routines, Pitt trailed
North Carolina State 145 .475—145 .2. But the
Panthers pulled through, scoring 49.1 total
points on the ﬂoor, led by seniors Alyse
Zefﬁro (9.9) and Erika Goldberg (9.85).

O’Connor and sophomore Roslyn

Singleton both received scores of 9.8 for
their ﬂoor routines. u

Zeﬂiro’s score was good enough to tie
for fourth best in school history in the event,
anditmarkedtheﬁfthtimeinhercareerthat
she has recorded a score of 9.9 or higher.

“We made improvements this week,”
said Pitt head coach Debbie Yohman. “Last
week, it was the ﬁrst meet, and there were a
lot of mistakes. We did_wel1, though, and
that’s the best part. The beam hurt us
[today], but, obviously, we did good We
had to depend upon other events to win.”

Also helping the Panthers was fresh-
man Andrea Arlotta’s performance on the
vault. Arlotta, competing in just her second
collegiate meet, recorded a 9.825, tying the
ﬁfth—highest score in Pitt history in the vault
despite missing most of practice this past
week with an injury.

“I was "nervous, but just before, it
became more excitement than nervous-
ness,” said]Arlotta, who has been battling
tendonitis in her right Achilles. "Ihe vault is
my most consistent event. It’s just a matter
of doing it.”

Virginia Tech comeback spoils 

Pitt’s shot at third Big East win

Basketball, page 17

Histed, taking a 27-25 advantage
into the locker room.

Virginia Tech appeared stunned
to start the second half, giving up
four quick points to Pitt forward
LaToya Kincaid. The Panthers
began the half leading’ 31-25 befor
the Hokies regrouped. ‘

Amy Kunich, who returned after
missing .11 games because of a
stress fracture in her foot, helped
keep Pitt ahead early in the second
half. She knocked down seven
points in the first seven minutes,
giving the Panthers their biggest
lead of the night, 42-34.

But the Hokies spent the next
six minutes proving why they are
ranked 23rd in the nation, putting
together a 14-0 run to move ahead
48-42. Virginia Tech guard Carrie
Mason, who had 13 second-half
points, scored eight points during
the run.

. Virginia Tech would never look
back. The Hokies out—rebounded the
Panthers, 18-13, in the second half
and used its big size advantage to
take over.

and they definitely had the size on
us.” Berenato said. “We felt that we
were even with them in-the first half
— we did a good job. The second
half, we were just jumping up for
the rebounds, and we couldn’t do
that against their size.”

The Pantherscut the lead to 56-

er three—pointer by Histed, but it
wasn’t enough. - The Hokies
11-4, in the final

67-57.

Histed led all scorers with a
career-high 19 points. The Panthers
had four players in double figures,
including Kunich, who knocked in
10 in her return

“I think the team is progressing
phenomenally, and I think that we
have a product that we are really
proud of.” Berenato said. “If you
were to ask me at the beginning of
the season where we’d be right now,
I’d say we wouldn’t win a Big East
game.” 1

The Panthers -look to capture

their third Big East win of the sea-

son Saturday afternoon as they trav-
el to St. John’s. Tip-off is set to
begin at 2 p.m.

In addition to her 10 points, Kunich

Bush’s comments on steroids in sports are hard to understand

Johnson, page 17

comment on the matter, which is no
surprise.

I’m not trying to get political
here, because I’m a sports writer,
not a politician.

But my question is, why, in
these troubled times, is ‘President
Bush trying to deal with this?

He can’t find a single weapon of
mass destruction in Iraq, but he
wants to find steroids in athletes.

I don’t disagree with the
President this time, for I believe the
use of steroids and performance-
enhancing drugs is bad‘ for our

sports and our youth.

However, I do question his true
intentions.

I think there is more to this than
President Bush wanting to protect
young athletes.

Bush has several ties, emotion‘-
ally and politically, with major
league baseball.

He was managing general part-
ner of the Texas Rangers before he
was elected governor of Texas on
Nov. 8, 1994. _

Baseball has been struggling
with steroid and performance-

enhancing drugs for a long while

now, including the death of

Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve
Bechler due‘ to the use of
Ephedrine.

I think that President Bush sees
the struggles of baseball and looks
to fix the problems so his close
partners with the Texas Rangers and
other franchises can benefit from it.

Yeah, it’s conspiracy theory-
like, but this is the same adminis-
tration that has had hidden agendas
before. . ..~,.-

It is the same administration
that said it had no plans of dealing
with Iraq when taking office in
2000, but somehow wrote in a
memo their plan to deal with Iraq.

Basically, and this is the bottom
line to this whole column, I feel
President Bush should keep his
head out of sports until he is out of
office. .

Until then, he should get into
his’office and start dealing with the
problems our nation has been facing
ever since he set foot in the Oval
Office. ,

Coincidence, I presume. .

Jimmy Johnson is a staff writer for
The Pitt News and he wants to
watch SportsCenter andnot have to
see highlights of a State ‘of the
Union Address ever again.

Steelers’ coaches
always seem-to

end up in Buffalo

Cunningham, page 19

last five years, consider this:

Gilbride was Mularkey’s boss as
the offensive coordinator in
Pittsburgh from 1999 to 2000.
Gilbride become the offensive
coordinator in Buffalo and
Mularkey got his job. Now,
Mularkey has been named the head
coach in Buffalo, and if Gilbride
doesn’t accept a head coaching
position somewhere else in the
league, Mularkey will be his boss
in Buffalo next season.

Now that’s what I call some

, backwards job mobility.

Michael Cunningham, is a senior,

staff writer for The Pitt News. He
thinks that the Steelers should hire
Matt Miloszewski as their new
quarterbacks coach.
