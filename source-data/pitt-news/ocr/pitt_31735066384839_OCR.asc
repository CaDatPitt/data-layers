The search to find a
replacement for former Vice-
chancellor for Student Affairs Al
Moye officially began this week
as a committee began reviewing
resumes of candidates.

The search committee,
headed by Edison Montgomery,
associate Vice-chancellor for the
Health Related Professions, met
Monday afternoon to study 13
resumes.

According to Montgomery,
the committee will meet once a
week throughout the fall

ﬁlled by January 1.

“We are to get a list of
candidates to the chancellor by
the first of’ October,”
Montgomery said.

Moye resigned the top
student affairs post at Pitt last
fall to accept the position of
deputy commissioner of the
Bureau of Higher and Contin_-
uing Education. William

months. The position must be .

Markus has served as acting
Vice-chancellor since that time
and is considered a candidate for
the permanent position.

Montgomery said the
committee will interview candi-
dates at future meetings,
“review resumes, rate them and
check references.” After this
stage candidates will be inter-
viewed by representatives from
approximately 20 student
organizations, a committee of
University trustees and a
committee of faculty members.
After these interviews the
students, trustees ‘and faculty
members will provide feedback
to the search committee.

There are 14 members on the
committee—three are students,
nine faculty members and two
administrators.

Dr. Molly Vogt, associate
dean from the school of the
Health-Related Professions is
the Vice-chairman and Dr. John
R. Vrana will serve as Executive

Secretary. Among the other
faculty members are Dr. Jack
Daniel, associate dean in the
College of Arts and Sciences and
Dr. Robert P. Gallagher,
Director of Counseling and
Placement. Student Govern-
ment Board president Josh
Baylson is among the three
student members.

The Vice-chancellor for
Student Affairs reports directly
to the Chancellor and serves as a
member of the Chancellor’s
Senior Staff. His various
responsibilities include serving
as a communications medium
between the Chancellor and
students in matters involving
non-academic and extra-
curricular programs, services
and activities. He establishes
policy for and approves the use
of University space by students,
participates in the executive
level planning for the Student
Union and chairs meetings of all
student affairs personnel of the
University.

The University Honors Program
(UHP), instituted last winter, has
received mixed responses on its
performance to date. Alex Stewart,
director of UHP, said the first term

of the program was “very
successful” and “very well-
received” by both students and
faculty.

Stewart stressed that the enroll-
ment for honors classes next fall is
already over 200 for the fall term,
and that freshmen are just
beginning to enroll. One hundred
and twenty students enrolled in the
15 honors program courses offered
last winter.

Stewart said he did not know
what response to expect to UHP
last winter. The small amount of
promotional material for the new

program added to Stewart's
doubts. He hoped at least 100
students would enroll in the
program.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said
he believes an evaluation of the
program's progress thus far would
be premature.

“It might be a little too early to

Approximately 2,000 freshmen
sampled Pitt academics and
activities this past weekend, as the
University held it’s annual fresh-
men orientation program.

Sponsored by the Orientation
Office and conducted by some 123
mentors. the program began
Saturday morning and lasted
through yesterday.

Freshmen were instructed in
registration, choosing a major and
getting a taste of cafeteria food.
Despite packed crowds at dances in
the Student Union and the Forbes
Complex, and Jimmie Walker’s
show Sunday night, a large number
of freshmen just mingled in the
Quad all weekend, listening to
WPGH radio (which broadcasted
from a truck parked in the Quad)
and participated in frisbee throwing
tournaments.

Freshmen interviewed by ThePitt
News commented on everything
from their advisors to re gistration-—
but almost all agreed that the
mentor program proved most
beneﬁcial.

look at the honors program,”
Marshall said.

Marshall pointed out that the
pre-registration system used at Pitt
makes it difﬁcultto develop quickly
a program like UHP. If a course is
to be included in the fall term
course descriptions, it must be
developed by the previous January.
This situation made it difﬁcult for
the UHP staff to offer courses other
than those developed at the time of
the program’s inception.

Marshall predicted a major test
of the honors program would come
this fall.

“One of the real tests of the
program is whether the freshman
class, which has been aware of
the program since its beginnning,
will respond with interest to the
program," Marshall said.

CAS Council has submitted the

“My mentor meeting was most
helpful,” said Donna Ryzner, a
theater major from Scranton.
“I think I’ll really like it here.”

Rusty Ryan from Bridgeport
(near Philadelphia) agreed.

“The only thing I really went to

were the mentor meetings,” he
said. _
Mentor Joni Homer was a

freshman at this time last year.

“I was glad to be able to help the
freshmen with things I was
confused about when I was a
freshman,” she said.

Andrew Wilson from Churchill
was much more familiar with the
Pitt aurroundings than many
freshmen.

“I met quite a few people,”
Wilson said. “Most of the people I
knew already though. I had some
worries about registration but my
advisor seemed to take care of
everything.” Wilson will commute
in the fall.

Breton Separatists Accused

Of Versailles Bombing

VERSAILLES, France—Police began a roundup of Breton
nationalists yesterday after uncovering evidence that a separatist
organization in Brittany was responsible for the bomb blast that
severely damaged one wing of the historic Palace of Versailles.

Police raids in the northwestern coastal province netted eight
nationalists, and officials said more arrests might be made.

All those arrested were being guestioned about the bombing, but
police sources expressed little hope of pinning down the bombers
quickly. “They are often fringe members of tiny groups,” a source
said.

The State Security Court, which investigates and tries offenses
against the security of the country, has taken over the case and is
instructing police in their investigation, official sources said.

The sources did not elaborate on what the new evidence in the
case was that led them to suspect Breton separatists. But a police
spokesman said Monday morning’s bombing, which wrecked three
ground-ﬂoor rooms in the Midi Wing of the 17th century palace, was
“completely in conformity with the style. form and tone” of
previous Breton bombings.

Reporters Face ‘Civil Slander’
Charges In Moscow

MOSCOW———Soviet officials yesterday ordered two Moscow-
based American news reporters to appear in court to face charges of
“civil slander. ” In a separate case, the Soviets temporarily freed a
U.S. businessman accused of smuggling currency in exchange for
the release to Soviet officials of two Russians charged with spying in
the United States. V

Court summonses were hand-delivered to Craig R. Whitney, 34,

"of The New York Times and Harold D. Piper, 39, of The Baltimore

Sun as they sat in their Moscow offices. They were ordered to appear
in court on Wednesday butswere not told why.

An official of the Soviet Foreign Ministry said the correspondents
were accused of “civil slander.” The reporters said they believed
the charges were related to dispatches they wrote from Tbilisi, the
capital of Soviet Georgia, disputing the authenticity of a nationally
televised “confession” last mqnth of a Georgian dissident.

Meanwhile, Francis J. Crawford, Moscow service manager for
International Harvester Co. of Chicago, was released from
Lefortovo Prison about 24 hours after two Russians facing spy
charges in the United States were freed in a tradeoff negotiated by
the two governments.

State House Raises Cigarette Tax

HARRISBURG—-The House voted yesterday to add a penny to the
existing 18-cent-per pack cigarette tax, which would raise an extra
$14 million for cancer control.

The proposal, approved 145-47, was sent to the Senate, where it
probably won’t be considered until after the summer recess.

“I don’t want to hold out unrealistic promises, but $15 million
used in a core way like this will certainly mean the effort against
cancer will be accelerated,” said state Health Secretary Leonard
Bachman, who lobbied hard for the cigarette tax.

“We have to take this step if some day we are going to realize a
decrease in cancer deaths,” he said in an interview.

_ Backman added that smoking is the number one reason for the
increase in lung cancer.

Rep. Kenneth Cole, D-Adams, urged passage of the tax, noting
that Pennsylvania spent $263,000 onits cancer program last year,
compared to New York’s $40 million and Texas’ $25 million.

“In 1977, 43,000 Pennsylvanians were diagnosed as having
cancer,” Cole said in a ﬂoor speech. f‘Over 25,000 die each year in
Pennsylvania from this dreaded disease.”

Stewart, Marshall Evaluate First
Year Of University Honors Program

These questions focus on several
concerns the CAS Council has had
about UHP. The major area
addressed, which also has been
raised in the past, is the relation
between UHP and department
honors programs.

“Department honors programs
group classes through several
levels and involve prerequisites,”
Stewart said, “UHP courses do not
have prerequisites.”

CAS Council also questioned

whether the honors program is
used as a recruiting device, and
whether it leads prospective
freshman to believe the University
offers a special service that does
not exist.

“Council is concerned as to
whether literature is misleading
students into believing we offer
more than we have,” said
Marshall. “As it exists, UHP is a
series of courses, not a real
program.”

‘‘72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Extend The Deadline

A parade of men and women dressed in white plan to march
through the streets of Washington, D.C., July 9. They have one
express purpose: to win an extension of the ratification deadline
for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).

The ERA, which simply states, “Equality of rights under the law
shall. not be denied by the United States or any state on account of
sex,” has become a major cause celebre between feminist and anti-‘
feminist factions. Supporters of the_amendment contend it is
needed to insure equal rights for women.

They point to the U.S. Supreme Court’s failure to use the Four-
teenth Amendment completely to grant equal rights to women as
proof that existing laws and constitutional provisions fail fully to
guarantee equality for women.

Their argument has much merit. The Supreme Court has failed
on several occasions to outlaw sexually discriminatory state legisla-
tion under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Proponents also offer two other solid’ arguments for the ERA.
They state that the amendment would have great symbolic
significance, showing the United States clearly supports total
equality for women, and that it would act as a model for equal
rights legislation in the various states.

In contrast, there are the feeble and faulty attacks by various
ERA opponents. Most anti-ERA groups complain it would lead to
unisexual public rest rooms, and require that women serve in com-
bat roles in the armed forces.

Both of these arguments are false, however. The Supreme Court
has interpreted the Constitution to include the right to privacy,
which would allow sexually segregated rest rooms and prisons.
Persons unfit to serve in combat could be excluded. Therefore,
most women would not serve in combat. -

The failure of the United States to finally recognize that women
should be treated as equal human beings would be a tragedy. Any
democratic means necessary_—including an extension of the
ratification limit beyond March 22, 1979--should be used, to- pass
the ERA. ' - '

Still, there must be some limits to the extension since the Con-
stitution states ratification should occur over a reasonable period
of time. A three-year extension, which would give ERA supporters
a full 10 years to win ratification, seems a fair length of time for
consideration of any constitutional amendment. A longer period
could be a. dangerous precedent for the future.

Exactly four years ago-—June 24, 

1974-1 boarded an airplane in San
Diego and ﬂew home to Pittsburgh.
It was the end of almost four years in
California, at sea and abroad, and I
was ready for an education.

The next day I was as freshman at
the University of Pittsburgh,
nervously note-taking my way
through two and a half hours of
introductory psychology. I soon
found note-taking and psychology
rather oppressive, and early on I
developed a severe distaste for two

into the mainstream of intellectual

life was pure exhilaration. No longer
cloistered and bound to tradition (I
had been in the Navy), 1 was free to

self-assurance has perhaps res-

career as an overage undergrad-

longer to get a degree than I had

these quasi-journalistic missives
has helped see to that. But I've
discovered in the process that I like
writing quite a bit more than
sociology. Such is the experiential
side of an education.

Education’s theoretical side-

and curricula—is this University's
primary responsibility. The fresh-

The value placed by students ‘on
theoretics-—book learnin’ if you
will—underlines the importance of
two controversies that have made
news here during the past year.
These controversies‘ have, for the
most part, grown from outgoing
College of Arts and Sciences Dean
Robert Marshall’s legitimate and
well-articulated concerns regarding

SIDELINES

the state of undergraduate educa-
tion at Pitt.

The first of these disagreements
involves curriculum. A return to
more structured curricula is the
latest fad in liberal arts (witness

Harvard, fashion leader of the ,

industry), and Pitt is likely to fall in
step sometime during the next year
or two. Core courses in math,
science and composition will
probably be required, and students
will generally be given more
forceful guidance in the directions
their educations will take.

Dean Marshall, who is in some
respects a neanderthal of the
decade past, does not like the latest
fashion. He argues that students
need maximum freedom to pursue
their own particular and varied
interests. They will also take basic
skills courses without requiring
them, he says, and he has armloads
of statistics to prove it.

Unfortunately, the Dean’s statis-
tics do not explain why there are so
many students at Pitt who, having
found their way to upper level
courses, can neither read nor write
like educated persons. The problem
is clearly one that is inherited from

increasingly inadequate public high
schools, but it is one the University
must face. If Ritt is to continue to
acceptstudents with these deﬁcien-
cies, perhaps a more structured
curriculum will cure them—though
one wonders how. (There are,
however, other and better argu-
ments for more stringent require-
ments. The notion that professors
might know better than students
what constitutes a good education is
one of them.)

An improvement in the quality of
teaching here might be one of
several other ways ‘in which
students’ basic skills could be
strengthened, and this leads us to
our second controversy.

Dean Marshall claims that “the
University doesn't value teaching
nearly so much as it does research”
(and perhaps some other things).
Undergraduates, he implies, are
poor relations when it comes to
priority-setting at Pitt.

University officials rightly em-
phasize the relationship between
research and teaching, but the
Dean’s point is nonetheless valid.
As our socialist friends frequently
remind us, large universities today
are remarkably reminiscent of large
corporations. Hence, ﬁscal consid-
erations loom large in the making of
university policy.

Prescient administrators recog-
nize that teaching Kantian ethics to
20-year-olds is not a proﬁt-making
venture; tuition bills, exorbitant as
they are, don't cover costs, and the
agencies and corporations dispen-
sing endowment money don’t give a
damn about Kant.

Americans live close to their
appetites for consumption, tech-

nology and leisure. Such ends are
best served, no matter ho N
abstractly, through research in the
hard sciences. It is in this direction,
then, that grant money tends to ﬂow.
Similarly, faculty are under great
pressure to gear ‘their work toward
publication—which spells prestige,
recognition and more money for the
University. Thus, the sciences

publicized, and professors know
that tenure, depends on written
output, not teaching. p
All of this does not mean it is
impossible to get a decent education
at Pitt. I am quite convinced, both
intuitively and by experience, that
this _University has on its faculty
some excellent teachers, some of
whom are dedicated to the
proposition that pedogogy is worth
the effort. But I am not laboring

thrive while the humanities; ..
struggle, research is subsidized and ‘

A-3

under the illusion that I am getting 

the best education possible. Other
schools offer much ‘better, and—in
another cultural moment, with
different values and new priorities-
Pitt could too.

Correction

A letter written by Mary .10

Wilson in the June 6, 1978. edition
of The Pitt News should have read
“...true enough there are some
supervisors who do not make life
easy for the staff." The letter was
inadvertently changed to read.
‘...true enough there are some
supporters who do not make life
easy for the staff." The Pitt News
regrets any misunderstanding that
resulted from this error.

Pitt sophomore Lynn Thomas had
his “orientation” last football
season. As a freshman, the
Mississippi native spent the season
backing up LeRoy Felder at
cornerback.

While Felder played, Thomas
kept his eyes and ears open. He knew
it would only be a matter of time
before he would get the chance to
contribute.

“It was a learning process for
me,” the 5-11, 180-pound Thomas
said in a recent interview. “I was

making the transition from «high
school to college ball, and every-
thing was new to me.

“I enjoyed myself,” he contin-
ued. “The only bad thing was that I
wasn't playing.” _

With Felder graduated and set to
try out with the Green Bay Packers,
Thomas will get his long-awaited
chance and has an excellent

‘possibility of starting when the

Panthers open their season at
Tulane in September.

‘‘I knew all the time I could play,”
Thomas said. I just had to wait my
turn.”

Sports

Thomas had one of the better
spring practices on the team this
April. He and running back Ray
“Rooster” Jones, a teammate of
Thomas’s at Pascagoula High
School, were named “most im-

proved” at the annual spring game.

“I remember the ﬁrst week of
spring practice,” Thomas said.
“None of the seniors were out yet,

 offeom players like Dave Parker is crucial to Buc success.

and I had to step in and be the‘ leader.
Iwas the only starter that first week
of camp.

“I liked that feeling,” the
sophomore added. “I was in a
position where I had to lead. It made
me feel good for the rest of spring
ball.”

Success isn't new to the Thomas
family. Lynn’s brother, Norris,
made the all-rookie team as a
starting defensive back for the

Miami Dolpins last season, while his ,

uncle, Jim Marseilles of the New
Orleans Saints, was a ﬁve-time,

all-pro selection at cornerback for
the Kansas City Chiefs.

Thomas’ younger brother
Wallace will join him in the Pitt
defensive backﬁeld this season.

“It’s a pretty good atmosphere to
grow up in,” Thomas said with a
smile. “My uncle and brother are
always teaching me pro tech-
niques.”

Thomas said he’ll give younger
brother Wallace a few pointers, too.

“I’m going to help him when I go
home. Tell him a little bit of what to
expect when he comes here.”

National League East Title
May End Up in Philadelphia
Despite Phillies’ Play

ByMARKMURPHY
Pin News Staff Writer

KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--In this
bafﬂing, complex, sometimes
depressing, often exciting but
always surprising baseball season,
to say anything is certain to occur is
like saying it don’t rain in
Indianapolis in the summertime.
But one outcome is certain: The
Philadelphia Phillies will win their
third consecutive Eastern Division
crown, although they may triumph
by default.

The Phillies 1978 victory won’t
come as their previous two did, when
a team of hungry athletes outhit,
outran and outdefensed ﬁve other
teams enroute to 100-win cam-
paigns. When the Phillies clinch the
title sometime this September, it will
occur as a result of excellent play at
home, mediocre play on the road, a
ﬁne bullpen to rescue so-so starters
and a lack of a dominant opponent
within their own division.

The Chicago Cubs were in tirst
place until last Sunday; the Cubbies
and the top spot havebeen married
in June and July many times in the
past, only to ‘ find themselves
divorced more times than Elizabeth
Taylor‘ in September. Despite the
addition of Dave Kingman, the
ridiculously high-salaried hybrid of
King Kong hitting and Godzilla
ﬁelding with the speed of the ‘Great
Pyramids, the Cubs lack the bats and
the pitchers necessary to stay on top.
Same time. next vear.

The Montreal Expos are the only
club strong enough to challenge the
Phils. Ross Grimsley and a talented
young outﬁeld are the Canadiens’
biggest plusses, but cagey manager
Dick Williams needs some more
pitching if his club is to pull off an

upset. Inexperience also could prove

fatal during the dog days of August
and September, but the Expos are
the kind of team that could surprise

, everyone, including themselves.

Where have all the Pirates gone?
Down, mostly, and that is why the
club that won 96 games a year ago is
just reaching .500. Outﬁelder Dave
Parker and pitcher John Candelaria
have dropped from their super
statistics of 1977, and the acquisition
of Bert Blyleven has returned few
dividends. Could more anemic
hitting A by regulars and a very
average bullpen give terminally
optimistic manager Chuck Tanner a
case of the blahs?

The Mets are the Mets, and little
else need be said. With only one
player of pedigree, Lee Mazilli, and
two million fans still mad that Tom
Seaver is gone, the Mets have no
choice but to stay_ at their present
level until all is forgotten and
forgiven. Say in about 25 years.

The Cardinals certainly are the
surprise team of 1978. Hitting
opposing pitches about as often as
the Lilliputians rapped out
Gu1liver’s fastballs, the Cards will
have to play some superb baseball
just to get back to the .500 level.

With that kind of opposition, how
can the Phillies not win? Although
every road trip has been a horror
story, the Phils remain the best
home club in baseball. They will win
about 60 at home and a minimum of
30 on the road, giving them at least
90 victories, probably more than
they will need.

The key to those 90 wins lies in
three areas: pitching, the tandem of
Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt
and that of Larry Bowa and Bake
McBride.

The pitching is as solid as it is
going to get. With the recent
addition of Rawly Eastwick and Dick
Ruthven, the bullpen is stronger
than ever, and the starting rotation
is a wee less shaky than it was.
Steve Carlton and Larry
Christenson still must find the form
that won them 23 and 19 games each
a year ago, and Ruthven, a pitcher
long on promise and short on
results, will become the number-
three starter.

Phillies owner Ruly Carpenter
doesn’t pay Luzinski and Schmidt
almost half a million dollars each
every year to smack hits when no
one is on base, but that is exactly
what they have been doing. Both
have failed to deliver the key hit all
season long, and the number of
Phils left on base this season is
embarrassingly high. But Luzinski
and Schmidt are streak hitters, ‘and
neither have gone off on one of the
month-long tears they are so used to
having. But they had better hurry;
there aren't too many months left.

Bowa and McBride are playing
brilliant baseball, leading off the
lineup by getting on base, and
creating breaks with some aggres-
sive baserunning. Phillies fans only
hope they can stay hot until Luzinski
and Schmidt get around to earning
their enormous salaries.
