Pitt to evict nine students

Will raze houses to make room for dorms

University and converted into apart-
ments, stand in the way of the
University’s new garden—style apart-
ment building. Pitt plans to bulldoze
the houses after the evictions are com-
pleted. Pitt has said the students must
vacate the premises by Aug. 1.

The University has applied to the
Pittsburgh zoning board for permission
to proceed.

The plan to raze the four houses,
however, may be in violation of the
South Oakland zoning ordinance. A
sign posted in front of 263 Oakland
Ave. states that Pitt’s request “does not
conform to the area provision of the
Pittsburgh zoning ordinance.” City
officials were unavailable for comment
or explanation of the ordinance viola-
tion.

The city zoning board of adjust-
ment will hold a public hearing on July
16 for area residents to express their
opinions about the proposal. The zon-
ing board of adjustment has the author-
ity to grant or deny Pitt’s request.

The University’s plans could be put
on hold if the board denies the request
to change the zoning for the properties
in question.

ignores police violence

ACROSS THE NATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Linda Tripp
says Maryland authorities are trying to
intimidate her.

Thatisherreactiontowordthatagrand
jury is being convened to look into whether
Tripp broke state wiretap laws by secretly
recording phone conversations with Monica
Lewinsky.

In a statement read by her attomey,
Tripp says she is not intimidated in any way.

Word of the state grand jmy probe
came as Tripp was spending a third day
before the federal grand jury looking into
Lewinsky’s relationship with President
Clinton.

In her statement, Tripp says she will
continue to testify truthfully and completely.

One of her attorneys called the grand
jury wiretap investigation virtually unprece-
dented in Maryland.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — There are harsh
words for the Clinton administration when it
comes to rooting out police brutality.

Human Rights Watch says the feds
have “dropped the ball.” A report by the
group says the Justice Department has yet to
comply with a 1994 law requiring it to col-
lect basic information on police use of
excessive force.

Further, the group says last year there
were just 29 prosecutions out of more than
11,000 complaints.

Human Rights Watch is calling on the
government to set conditions on the aid it
gives local police departments and to require
concrete steps by local governments to end
police abuse.

MCKEESPORT, Pa. —Allegheny
County Coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht yesterday

McKeesport cemetery by utility crews

repairing downed power lines. Wecht said

the body is that of 14-year-old Kimberly
Krirmn, who was last seen by her family
June 30 and was reported missing on Friday.
Her body was identiﬁed after an autopsy
yesterday morning and with the help of den-
tal records.

GETIYSBURG, Pa. ’-— State police have
made an arrest in the Friday shooting of a
Civil War re—enactor.

52-year-old Christian Evo of Muret,
France, was arrested by the Washington,

being housed at the District of Columbia
Metropolitan Jail awaiting extradition to
Pemisylvania. '

He has been charged with simple
assault and recklessly endangering another
person. Charges were ﬁled on Monday.

of media and spectators who came to
watch the walk.

About 200 people attended the fire-
walk.

The 120-foot record that Willey
unofﬁcially broke on national television
Thursday was never actually recorded in
the Guinness Book of World Records,
but was passed between fans of ﬁre-
walking by word of mouth.

According to Willey, his record,
which still has to be conﬁrmed by
Guinness, can be attributed to pure sci-
ence. He walks on fire to prove there is
nothing more than physics going on
when he walks on the coals and ends up
with nothing but dirty soles.

Saar, his opponent, believes the
opposite — state of mind controls the
ability to walk on ﬁre.

Either way, the two walked away

mass of awe—struck spectators in their

THE Prrr NEws

Risky teen research

The National Institute of Nursing
Research granted a University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center doctor
$250,000 to study why minority girls
from ages 11 to 13 engage in early
sexual activity.

Dr. Willa Doswell said she plans
to test whether girls from unstable
family structures with inadequate
financial resources will develop early
sexual behaviors and experience early
puberty. .

She also has a theory that states
that accelerated sexual behavior and
engagement in other risky activities is
triggered by intent to engage in such
behaviors and does-

n’t

have come from
unstable family
environments.

Despite this theory, previous stud-
ies of other age groups have discov-
ered that girls who come from two-
parent homes seem to prioritize mar-
riage first and having a baby second.
The opposite is true of girls who come
from one-parent homes.

The ultimate goal of this study,
according to Doswell, is to target girls
who may engage in sexual behaviors
too early and teach them about other
things, such as fostering self-esteem
and living a healthy life, and to stay

UPB wins award

The University of Pittsburgh at
Bradford was recently honored with a
silver award for its excellence in
admissions advertising.

The Admissions Marketing
Report awarded UPB for its total
advertising campaign, including cam-
pus visitor literature; a student
“search” piece; its student recruitment
video, which won its own individual
merit honor; and a
“view book” with
photos of the campus
and student life.

More than 500 insti-
tutions entered from
the United States and Canada —-— the
largest-ever Marketing Report compe-
tition.

Submissions were scored by a
panel of judges including directors
from advertising agencies, marketing
professionals and marketing profes-
sors.

Rachel Rogers, a freelance
designer from Frankford, N.Y.,

HARRIS-SCHENZ

Government Board.

She said she plans to have several
committee members travel to different uni-
versities, leam about the curricula they
have implemented and talk to students
there.

“We may like [their curriculum] or not,
but at least we will be aware of it,” she said

If the committee ﬁnds a need for a
change in undergraduate curriculum at Pitt,
it will then decide how to implement the
changes.

“Once we arrive at a decision, it won’t
be news to students and faculty. They will
know all along what will go on,” Harris-
Schenz said.

Harris—Schenz said she feels that, like
fonner Dean Brumble, she is someone stu-
dents can speak with about undergraduate
issues.

CAS Dean John Cooper agreed, say-
ing he chose to appoint Hanis-Schenz to
the position because “she is well known for
her strong personal commitment to under-
graduate education.”

He said her teaching philosophy,
undergraduate teacher evaluations and let-
ters of support from faculty, students, and
fonner students exempliﬁed her commit-
ment.

“[She has] by far the strongest level of
enthusiasm among the faculty that I have
talked to,” Cooper said.

FROM PAGE 1

Alyson Wallach, SGB president who
co-taught a ﬁeshman studies class with
Harris—Schenz, also agreed that Harris-
Schenz shows commitment to undergradu-
ate students.

“She is very student-friendly,” Wallach
said. “She has an open door policy for stu-
dents.”

Even if Harris—Schenz has a busy day,

‘she will still put time aside to meet with a

student, Wallach said.

“Unforttmately, that’s rare,” she said.

Harris—Schenz said she thinks her 28
years of teaching the German language will
help to prepare her for her new job as the
associate dean for undergraduate studies.

Her previous job as vice provost for
faculty affairs also helped to prepare her for
the position, resolving personnel issues for
faculty members. In her new position, she
will do this for undergraduate students
regarding issues such as cheating and pla-
giarism.

Harris—Schenz served as the assistant
dean of CAS ﬁom 1980-85, and received
the Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching
Award in 1988. She also served as one of
11 members of a National Task Force
charged by the American Council on the
Teaching of Foreign Languages to develop
the foreign language performance stan-
dards for students in ldndergarten to 12th
grade.

dents find a new place to live.
Precisely how the University plans
to help the students remains to be
seen.

“They’re [students] probably
going to wind up at the housing
resource center — it may be their
last resort,” said Michael Carnes of
the department of property manage-
ment, who is in charge of'Pit_t-
owned off—campus housing. 9

To ease the transition to new
living arrangements, the University
is offering displaced students some
financial assistance.

“Property management realized
it [moving] was an inconvenience,
so they’re offering [students] a
month’s free rent,” said Pitt
spokesman Ken Service.

Pitt also plans to pay the dis-
placed students’ electric utility bills
for one year.

The University may be trying to
lighten the burden it is imposing on
the nine students affected, but
Laurie Chain, a junior biology
major, is not appeased.

“We’re not happy about it — at
all,” she said of being forced to
move.

Chain sublets an apartment in
one of the buildings scheduled for
demolition from Paul Stephan, who
attends Pitt’s pharmacy school.

Stephan, she said, has been to

Chain said.

The University recently remod-

Stephan and Chain will be forced to

Stephan’s new apartment A is
nowhere near as nice.

Moving is also an inconve-
nience, Chain said. She moved into
the apartment on Oakland Avenue
in May and now has to move again,
only two months later. .

She said Pitt had originally told
her and Stephan that it would be a
minimum of two years before the
school would begin the eviction
process.

Then, she said, University offi-
cials called her last week and said,
“Aug. 1 We’re moving you.”

The new residence hall will
accommodate 204 students in apart-

complete the building by the begin-
ning of the fall 1999 semester.

 Settlement optimal for GM,
UAW and U.S. economy

Five weeks have passed and
the General Motors strike is still
not resolved, ‘though both GM
management and the United
Autoworkers Union claim to be
making progress. The ball is in
GM’s court to break the deadlock.

With thousands of workers on
strike in plants in the United
States, Mexico and Canada, the
strike has had a negative effect not
just on the auto industry, but on
other industries in the economy
— particularly the glass, plastics,
and steel industries. As of June 30,
GM had lost $1.18 billion’ due to
the strike. Production at most auto
parts plants halted, which stopped
production at 26 of 29 GM assem-
bly plants.

The trickle-down effect has
been felt on consumers. With GM
car dealerships receiving no new
cars to sell, the decreased supply
of cars in the market has led to an
increase in the price of new and
second-hand automobiles by
every car manufacturer, not just
GM. A CNN consumer report
found that since the beginning of
the strike, dealerships have
pushed up prices by up to 20 per-
cent.

Even stores in small towns
such as Flint, Mich. are feeling the
pinch. With UAW strike pay at

$150 a week, consumption has
decreased as striking workers
have less money to spend. Over
160,000 workers have been tem-

porarily laid off by GM, and out- ’

side suppliers have laid off thou-
sands more.

Though GM management has
promised to invest in its North
American operations, there is a
current trend for globalization, or
in more ‘honest terms, building
plants and operating in countries
where labor is cheap, health care
insurance is there for those who
can afford it and working condi-
tions are appalling.

This is primarily what UAW
workers are ﬁghting for: prevent-
ing the drifting of jobs from their
towns to the cheapest bidder,
medical beneﬁts and fair wages.

UAW has laid down its
demands. It’s up to GM to act, and
act soon, before the effects of this
strike do further damage on the
economy as a whole.

Since proﬁts, not consumers,
seem to drive corporations these
days, it’s in GM’s best interest to
end it soon. Its market dominance
is at stake, and its proﬁts are dry-
ing up. '9

For worker, consumer, and
corporation, this strike needs to
end.

Right-wing rhelorc

The issues of freedom of expression and
the revolt against conformity are becoming
more and more complex with each “break-
through” the public feasts its eyes and ears on.
One particular case, the coming—out episode of
“Ellen,” has triggered a peculiar yet not whol-
ly surprising response from a little gospel
group called Angie & Debbie, which released
a song facetiously titled “Not Natural” that
contains an overtly anti-gay message.

As if the group’s typically oversimpliﬁed
moans about the “loosening of the moral fab-
ric of America” aren’t ridiculous enough, it
confounds the issue by fancying themselves
rebels. Angie & Debbie’s song has, not sur-
prisingly, caused a great deal of out-
rage among gay-rights advocates.

The attention Angie & Debbie
have received appears to have gone
to their heads, ﬁlling them with the
illusion that they are going “against the ﬂow,”
which is, ironically, the title of the record label
they started when they feared no other labels
would back their controversial message.
Angie & Debbie have confused rebellion with
an artiﬁcial and antiquated view of what is
natural.

An article in the November ‘97 issue of
Billboard magazine quotes one of the mem-
bers as saying “I’m glad for the controversy...
I didn’t expect it to be this big this soon, but

people often have to be stirred up to live.

right.”

The group’s message is nothing but a
regurgitation of backward-thinking Christian
Fundamentalists who are afraid of losing con-
trol. It is ridiculous to claim to have a monop-
oly on the deﬁnition of “living right.”

The notion that homosexuality is a sin is
not only an imaginary and artiﬁcial view, it’s
also prejudiced. The same member of the
group is also quoted as saying “It’s not that
[we’re] saying things that no one has ever
heard. We just weren’t afraid to say them.”

In the same manner, the KKK and other hate
groups aren’t afraid to spread their self-right-
eous banter. _

I would like to ask the members of the
group just how they arrived at their under-
standing the criteria “not natur ” and “living
right.” Have they arrived at their prejudices
the same way members of the K have,
through mental intimidation of their vulnera-
ble minds from authority ﬁgures? Do they in

turn pass on this intimidation to others?

Perhaps the task of free thinking is too
much for Angie & Debbie. An ideology can
only be taken as true if you stay within certain
boundaries. That the members of the group are
rebels can only be taken as true if they stay
within their small and artiﬁcial worlds.

Certainly a rebel does not let his or her
mind become consumed by every media virus
that passes through it. To refute the notion of
gay rights because it is a current trend or
because it challenges one’s long-held notions
of what is good and decent shows a cow-
ardice.

Conformity comes in all shades. One can
believe oneself to be a rebel while

ideology. How can Angie &
Debbie call themselves rebels
while their own kind continue to
prosper and control the minds of those not
inclined to think for themselves? Being a rebel
often means letting go of one’s precious ide-
ologies when they no longer work.

America is a severely fractured society,
with groups acting in their own self-interest,
each insisting they are right, refusing to let
their frightened little minds open. It is in this
state of America that backward thinkers such
as Angie & Debbie can say something like
“we want to go against the ﬂow in every
aspect of the business.” Such a quote could
have just as easily come from Marilyn
Manson, who has gone after just about every
taboo there is.

Total freedom of expression does seem to
be within reach, but one has to ask oneself
whether that -is such a good thing. A certain
amount of tension between opposing factions
is necessary to create a ground fertile for true
rebels to manipulate and beat the system. A
certain amount of censorship seems to be nec-
essary for freedom of expression to have real
value.

And could the ﬁnal result of anarchical
society result in a different form of oppres-
sion? Could Christianity and so-called
“decency” someday become taboo? And
would those taboos have to be broken as well?

Zachariah Blott

Entertalnment Edltor

The other week, I walked into
Pittsburgh’s favorite health food store, The
“O,” to get my summer school ﬁx of ﬁies
coated in enough grease to weaken a table-
top. While I waited for my order, some-
thing slightly odd happened: I looked at my
receipt and noticed I was charged the 10
percent service charge.

I had intentionally bopped into
The “O” at 9:50 p.m. ——' what I believed to
be 10 minutes before the service charge for
extra security kicked in — because 10 I
p.m. was when the blue boys
showed up to watch six hours of

ics, the A’s and the Raiders, but
the Pittsburgh Oakland, the
suburb of a ﬂoundering city ’
never quite sure if its sports
teams will still be there in
ﬁve years.

Being inquisitive, like a
good journalist, I asked the cashier have a
about her apparent ﬁnger-dexterity mishap sion to hire cop man

on the register. She informed me The “O”
was now extremely interested in my safety
not just from 10 p.m to close, but also in
the violence-riddled 9 to 10 p.m. time slot.

For those readers who are from
Lancaster County or some other back-
woods area of central Pennsylvania (that
being central Pennsylvania minus down-
town Hanisburg) and aren’t in the know,
The “O” has less people, let alone mean
ones, through its doors in that hour than a
Saturday-moming chemistry class.

For God’s sake, the presence of
these gloriﬁed hall monitors before mid-
night isn’t something worth paying for.

This isn’t Detroit.

This isn’t south central L.A.

This isn’t Washington, D.C.

more than the air— ‘"9470/e \ for buckets and
tight seal on a bag of chips (which from the mops: Don’t for-

looks of some of them, they probably do
quite often).

But because complaining about
this charge on that fateful night would have
gotten me nothing but kicked out of the
place, I decided instead to spend my 10-
minute wait for ﬁench fries thinking of a
few other equally-worthy charges that

 

get the soap and water, as well.

could ask me to pay $110 every four
months (or semester, if you will) to use a

ups. And because I could never even imag-

ns hanging out at The ‘'0'’?

inc printing out enough paper to exhaust
my $110, they would have enough extra
money to drop the buckets and mops

4) Fifty cents per bathroom
visit: Their bathrooms may not be top-rate
—— OK, they more resemble the trash room
on the Death Star in Star Wars than the
bathroom in my apartment — but I’m sure
someone would have to go bad enough to
actually use them. So why not charge those
patrons for braving the spelunking exhibi-
tion to the gaseous caves of Oakland’s own
slice of Hades? Other countries do.

5) Hiring under-certiﬁed work-

ers: This is more a cost-cutting measure
than a charge, but still a good trick they can
steal from Pitt. If a major university gets
away with charging their students top dol-
lar for classes taught by 24-year-old gradu-
ate students, The “O” should hire pizza
makers with leprosy and 12-year-old
immigrants to sell 40’s of Colt ‘45. I’m
sure they could pay a little under $5 a day
for 18 hours of work from these less-than-
acceptable examples and watch the proﬁts
roll in. They might even have enough cash
left over to give their head manager a
$30,000 bonus, just like Pitt gave to
Chancellor N ordenberg this past year.

Now if you think any of these
changes would improve your visits to
Oakland’s oldest restaurant as much as its 9
p.rn. to 4 am. security charge, go down to
3901 Forbes Ave. and let your voice be
heard Let them know more charges, not
less, is the way to go.

And take this article with you for
an extra 30 percent on your next pmehase.

Zachariah Blott went to Carnegie Mellon
in 1993 and remembers “O” pizzas costing
$3.49 with no late-night charges. Ah, the
good old days.

Disheveled, disoriented and without curling iron

Jennifer Stoltz
Columnist

What I ﬁrst thought was an inter-
esting view turned out to be a ﬁve-day
nightmare, starting at 2:59 p.rn.

At least that’s what the clock in our
kitchen indicated, its hands frozen in
infamy. Last Tuesday, while at UPMC
Passavant Hospital, a group of four co-
workers went to the back of the building to
watchastormthatwas supposedlyheaded
our way. Anything to avoid work for a few
minutes, I ﬁgured

Ashorttime later, whatlcanonly
describe as a wind-propelled wall of rain
nrshed towards us. In awe of this strange
sight, we retumed indoors.

Minutes later, chaos ensued. The
power failures, horrendous rain and win-
dow-rattling winds we experienced need no
explanation. If you're reading this, most
likely you somehow were touched by the
storm’s wrath.

We ended up ftnnbling our way
outofthebasernentﬁleroomwitharms

pesky rolling chairs. Upon entering the
emergency-power-lit hallway, we were
neady blindsided by public safety oﬂicers
rushing across to Divine Providence, where
three nuns were hurt.

telling stories and playing games by ﬂash-

dragged by, the novelty quickly wore off

It is amazing what the lack of elec-
tricity can do to fray a person’s nerves.

Constantly restless, nearly my entire neigh-
borhood would leave in a mass exodus to
who-knows-where until at least 9 p.m., after
which time it wouldn’t really matter if there
were lights. When you were at home, you
couldn’t do anything except talk to people.

never realize how much you take these
things for granted: food that doesn’t hit over
40 degrees, the curling iron for bad hair
days, the TV you have fallen asleep to for
years. It may all sound vain and materialis-

Ruing the mysterious disappearance of ”coo

Dave Madden

columnist

“It goes back to the glee of America, to the
honesty of America, to the funny spiteless-
ness of old big-ﬁsted America.” —— Jack
Kerouac, ‘The Origins of the Beat
Generation.”

I often cringe when I quote Kerouac,
which is a shame because he wrote a lot of
genuinely good stulf. The reason is that I
know what I think when others quote
Kerouac, and how much an institution of
I-Iipithasbecometobeabletoquote
Kerouac, or any of the Beat authors for that
matter.

Our generation has lost the idea of Cool.
We haven’t lost the ability to identify poten-
tially cool things, we just can’t seem to keep
them cool. Kerouac et. al. have been cool for
decades, but now we put them on T—shirts
and listen to Top-40 songs written for or
about them. Identifying with, alluding to or
writing about the beats is now so common-
place it’s become trite.

The phenomenon is called “coo ” for a
reason: one remains cool, one keeps his cool.

‘ There’s also a reason that the variants of

“coo ” (like “c ' ”) go along with the cold

A metaphor: you don’t get all hot and bothered,

you chill. Coolness is taken in stride. It’s all
about being conﬁdent and self—assured that
you and what you’re into is cool and needs
no explanation.

THE P111 News

Today, we take what is cool and exploit
it to such a point that it loses all original

charm and interest I luckily saw “South »

Park” the TV show before I saw “South
Park” the T-shirt, sticker, baseball cap and
other general hoopla. Perhaps it was the pre-
vious lack of Comedy Central here in the
‘Burgh that did it, but eventually, with
“South Park” being everywhere I looked, the
show turned into a current “Beavis and Butt-
head” -- generally funny, but same-old and
tiresome.

I may sound like some jaded idiot who
likes anything for several months and then
searches high and low for the next new
thing, but look at “Calvin and Hobbes” and
you’ll see what’s up. Bill Watterson, creator
of the comic strip, asked his syndicate never
to license his strip, and they never did.
Throughout the duration of “Calvin and
Hobbes,” it retained its integrity and popu-
larity without becoming exploited. Does the
minimal numbers of “Calvin and Hobbes”
authentic T-shirts have anything to do with
this? Yeah, I think it does.

It’s not our generation that makes the T-
shirts and other various merchandise, but it is
our generation that buys them. The geniuses
of Cool who made the bootlegged “Calvin
and Hobbes” T—shi1ts depicting them drunk
(“geniuses” was bitter sarcasm, these partic-
ular shirts are perhaps the direct opposite of
Cool) realized that our generation would eat
them up, and subsequently made millions off
them.

p Sexual desires ruin
socialist dispositions

We just can’t seem to keep anything
cool anymore. Maybe it’s because we grew
up in the ‘80s, where every summer we
expected there to be some sort of blockbuster
movie with a merchandising extravaganza
attached, but somehow we’ ve forgotten
what it means to be cool. This is why I’m
writing this column: to tell everyone, before
the world becomes ‘saturated with “take me
drunk I’m home” or any sort of pseudo-hip
marijuana T-shirts, about the unfortunate dis-
appearance of Cool.

There’s nothing wrong with drinking or
smoking-up, besides the obvious health and
legal reasons. Yes, these things can be cool,
but it’s deﬁnitely not cool to emblazon it on
a T-shirt to the point where you become a
walking advertisement for whatever product
you like so much. Maybe there’s a slight

,“ballsy” factor to be considered, since not

everyone would wear a shirt saying they
smoked illegal substances, but balls can only
go so far. .
TherehastobeawaythatCoolcan
exist alongside the hungrily maniacal con-
sumer culture we live in, and it should be our
generation’s job to ﬁnd it. I used to think that,
compared to the ‘50s, where one was
rewarded for how well one was liked by
everyone else, the ‘90s (where being dilTer—
ent from everyone else seems to be heavily
rewarded) was a hot bed for individuality
and creativity, and therefore it would be easy
to ﬁnd Cool anywhere you looked. Then I
realized that some of the century’s coolest

In

people lived in the ‘40s and ‘50s, and it’s
actually really hard to ﬁnd genuinely cool or
“chill” people nowadays.

What happened in between the birth of

Cool and today that made Cool such an elu-
sive concept? Why is it so hard to ﬁnd? All I
know is that it isn’t too late to reverse the
process of “uncoo ° g” that’s been going on.
I think it just takes a lot more work than it
used to. Cool things are out there, but now,
with television —- which isn’t necessarily
uncool -—— so prevalent, you just have to look
a lot harder past the things with which you
are bombarded every day.
_ Cool is deﬁnitely in the eye of the
beholder. I personally don’t think “60
Minutes” is a very cool TV show, and I reck-
on the majority of today’s youth culture
would agree with me. But if you think it’s
cool, then that’s ﬁne. Just don’t go wearing a
witty “60 Minutes” T-shirt and expecting to
be cool. And if someone else ﬁnds out about
your love for the show and says to you, “My
God, I’ve seen every episode! Isn’t Andy
Rooney just so cool?!,” just smile, nod, and
say, “Yeah man, cool.”

Here’s the only advice I can give: drink
what you want, smoke what you want,

watch whatever you want on the TV, read '

whichever authors you feel like reading and
listen to the bands you want to listen to. But
in doing all of those, try to adhere to quality
and just be cool about whatever it is you like.

Ozzy sbourne’s ta glry

By JAKE WOMER

The Ozzman has come to roost
over the hen house.

In the land of heavy metal, every-
body pays homage to Ozzy Osbourne
in one way or another.

Industry 
leaders like
Tool do it by 
continuing to

And no-talent marke cks lik 1

Ozzy Osbourne-of-old by copying the
macabre image. -

Manson joined with Pantera and
Ozzy’ s Black Sabbath reunion last
summer to make Ozzfest the number-
one tour of 1997. For Ozzfest '98, Ozzy
returns to Star Lake Amphitheatre
Sunday with a circus of metal stars
including Tool, Megadeth, Soulﬂy,
Limp Bizkit, Sevendust and Coal
Chamber. And that’ s just the main
stage.

Motorhead headlines the second
stage with a gaggle of bands such as
Incubus, Kilgore, Life of Agony, The
Melvins, Snot, Ultraspank, System of a
Down and Master Voodoo Machine.

Sure, Ozzy benefited from his
association with supreme talent. His
years in Black Sabbath linked his name
to Seminole metal songs like ”War
Pigs,” ”Iron Man” and, of course,
"Paranoid.” Ozzy left the band in 1979
and generated an equally successful
solo career. Once again, he beneﬁted
from working with guitarist Randy
Rhoads, arguably the best ever. The
team produced classics like ”Mr.
Crowley” and ”Crazy Train.”

All of the greats know enough to
surround themselves with the best.
Now, Ozzy is the godfather of metal
and he has continued surrounding
himself with solid talent. Although
some of the groups are just tag-alongs,
others like Tool, Motorhead, Megadeth
and Soulﬂy are dynamic enough to
add to the generation—spanning expe-
rience that is Ozzy.

Selzer drops into blues fest

By BRETT TAYLOR

With the neo-swing movement
in full, er, swing, the popular music
scene seems to have gone full circle.
Today's MTV-ites are listening to a
punked-up ’90’s version of their
grandparents’ music.

Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal
Crown Review are all the rage,
decked out in vintage pinstriped
suits, playing the swinging jump
blues that became popular in the
1940's. But with the exception of Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy, they fall short
of the music of yesteryear, settling
instead for a simplified sound remi-
niscent of ska with a swing beat.

Rising above the mediocrity of
peer bands —— with high-piled hair,
a bright-blue silk suit, his shirt but-
toned half-way-up and blazing a
fiery lick on his orange '59 Gretch
guitar is Brian Setzer and his 16-
piece rockin’ big band, who roll into

l.C. Light Ampitheatre this Sunday,
headlining the Pittsburgh Blues
Festival.

The Brian Setzer Orchestra was
the first of these new bands to
explode on to the scene. But make
no mistake, Brian Setzer is not try-
ing to play a punked-up version of
Duke Ellington’s music.

Setzer, who lead the ’80’s rocka-
billy revival as singer/ guitarist of
the Stray Cats, took a chance in cre-
ating a band he wasn't sure he could
even pay. It was a new concept in
keeping to his rockabilly roots and
combining it with a big band.

The result is a one-of-a-kind bril-
liance that is accessible to big-band
loving grandparents and punk rock-
ers who crave energy and style.

Setzer’s third and newest
album, The Dirty Boogie, once again
shows off his rockabilly roots with a
renewed ﬂair. Where their first self-
titled album was a conservative
mostly jazz album, and their sec-
ond, Guitar_ Slinger, was a manic

”High art.” It's a phrase intend-
ed to label something as untouch-
able, something that transcends the
artifice and pretension of the art
world to stand on it's own as work
beyond the ordinary.

It's something nearly everyone
strives for and very few achieve.

It's something, in film, which
usually requires either a very inno-
vative or plainly outstanding effort.
By this definition, the new film
High Art does not necessarily suc-
ceed, but it certainly tries.

A dream-like, ever—so—slightly
disjointed film about the art culture
of New York and life and love
therein, High Art centers around the
life of Syd, a young assistant editor
for an incredibly preten-
tious photography maga-
zine. She's good at what she
does, but those above her
do their best to make her
feel subordinate. Living
with her boyfriend in a
seedy apartment building, Syd
notices water dripping from the
ceiling. In investigating, she discov-
ers a rather interesting assortment
of people in the apartment above.
They are the guests and friends of
one Lucy Berliner, a famous retired
photographer.

Syd’s professional interest is
immediately sparked. One thing
leads to another, and Lucy and Syd
find themselves drawn together.
Syd is just getting into the exciting
and glamorous lifestyle of the art
world, and Lucy is the jaded artist
who finds a freshness and inno-
cence in Syd that makes her world-
weary, drug-addicted friends seem
pale and shallow by comparison.

Radha Mitchell (left) and Ally   other In 

  

 
   

 

Their relationship quickly goes far
beyond art, and neither is quite sure
how to deal with the consequences.

As films go, High Art is pretty
enough, well put-together, but by
no means slick or overproduced. It
retains the grit and rough edges of
the indie, although this is usually
unobtrusive. The performances, for
the most part, are ordinary, but the
leads are extraordinarily well-acted
by Ally Sheedy as Lucy and Radha
Mitchell as Syd. The music is
appropriate, and the muted, lo-fi
nature of the soundtrack gives the
picture a gentle dream-like ambi-
ence.

As a critique of the art world, a
morality message, a hip indie film
and even as high art, this film falls
somewhat short. The level on
which it succeeds is as a
love story. As Syd discov-
ers, art is not just What
sells a magazine, falls
within the art world's
standards or what the crit-
ics gush over. Art, high art,
is intensely emotional, deeply per-

sonal —— and often achieved at the »

expense of artists, or those they
love. Although writer-director Lisa
Cholodenko may have made those
sacriﬁces, her film simply remains
art, not high art. But high art runs
the risk of being less accessible, so
accessible art is perhaps preferable.

Those offended by lesbian love
scenes don't have to worry. This
movie probably won't show up at
your local multiplex. How much
true art ever does? For everybody
else, especially those interested in
art — or love — this film offers
something better than the snobbiest
chic or most pretentious ”high art”
— a genuine love story.

FROM PAGE 9

”Lets Live it Up,”
another Setzer original, follows a
remake of the old country song
”This Old House.” The listener
doesn't get to take a rest until the
guitar—heaVy remake of the old
Santo and Johnny instrumental
”Sleepwalk.” This song from the
mid—’50s exemplifies Setzer’s return
to his roots.

In this return to his roots, Setzer
did have to go light on some of his
trademarks from past albums,
namely his long electric guitar solos
and Sinatra-esque crooning. On the
Louis Prima song ”Jump Jive an’
Wail,” for example, his big band
takes center stage punching out the

of No Doubt. And he ends the
album on a note of brilliance: with
”As Long as I'm Singing.”

This song is the perfect display
of Setzer’s abilities — songwriting,
guitar playing, singing and the
energy he brings to a band. ”As
Long as I'm Singing” shows off his
inﬂuences, his traditional big band
rhythm guitar playing, his perfectly
crafted solo and his Sinatra / Dean
Martin vocal abilities.

The biggest shame of the matter
is that although Setzer is in his 405,
he came about 40 years too late to be
a part of the rat pack. He has their
ability to carry (and sing) a song,

The sights and sounds of this

‘ year’s World Cup are echoing around

the globe as the most famous game in
all of sports takes center stage.

For every culture on our planet,
except for the one we know in the
United States, the game of soccer is
always in the spotlight.

Futbol, as it’s called elsewhere, is
a game cherished throughout Europe
and South America, and the populari-
ty and excitement the game brings is
growing as I write. For the countries
outside the United States, soccer is a
way of life.

This sport has much more mean-
ing and history than popular sports in
America, although most people
around these parts bleed black and
gold.

In the game of soccer, good play-
ers use imagination in a game they’ve
played since they learned to run.
Dominant teams like Brazil, France,
Germany and Argentina conducttheir
strategies on the ﬁeld just like a group
of musicians would collaborate their
styles to create one unique jam.

Soccer is a form of art when it’s
played as a team sport, a national
sport or a people sport. The top play-
ers in the world are the ones who can
excel at their own individual strengths
within the concept of their team. The
excitement I see on the faces of play-
ers and fans as their teammates and
heroes live out their dreams is evi-
dence that this game is more than just
a game. It’s a way of life.

I was disappointed when Team
USA was dismissed in the early
round. We played better than Iran in
an emotional, politically-charged
matchup, but unfortunately came up
short. The players from Iran deserved
to win because they’ve worked harder
at the sport, and paid their dues long
before we got used to the idea of not
using our hands.

This game that the world has put
its faith in is much more than another
season or tournament. For Americans
to think that after 10 years of playing
the game we should dominate it is
absurd. It just shows how outrageous
our ego is, and how little we under-
stand what kind of commitment it
takes to be the best.

Throughout their adolescence, the
players of other countries participat-
ing in the World Cup dreamed of
scoring a goal, of making their coun-
try proud and of representing a part of
their culture they deeply follow and
believe in. The situation in the U.S. is
different. We are learning a new game
that the people in Europe and South
America have never been without.

Big East unveils new logos

Patrick Robertson

Sports Edltor

The Big East Conference
armounced a change in its logo last
weekend.

The Conference which celebrates
its 20th anniversary this season
unveiled two new logos. The first logo
contains the words “Big
East” above a red ban-
ner garnering the word
“Conference.”

The second logo

adds the 20th anniver-
sary theme with “1979”
printed on the left and
“1999” on theright, and   _   _p  _  H

will be used in all events
this coming year.

The Big East did not start out as big
as it is today and didn’t even have foot-
ball teams until 1991.

This is the fourth year the confer-
ence will contain basketball.

The conference was established in
May 1979 with only eight teams:
University of Pittsburgh, Boston
College, University of Connecticut,
Georgetown University, Providence
College, St. John’s University, Seton
Hall University and Syracuse
University.

Since its inception, the conference
has taken on several new schools.

Villanova jumped on the wagon for
the 1980-1981 season, and Pitt joined

Rutgers and Notre Dame.

   
  

the 1982-1983 lineup.

The University of
Miami came along in 1990
and the league expanded
again in 1994, adding West

" Virginia University,

The Big East split into two sections
for the 1996-1997 basketball season -
The Big East Six and The Big East
Seven.

The conference boasts eight foot-
ball programs: Boston College,
Connecticut, Miami, Pitt, Rutgers,
Syracuse, West Virginia, and two
schools whose football teams play in
the Big East: Temple University and
Virginia Tech.

The last national title in any sport
for the league came when St John’s
men’s soccer took the championship in
1996. The conference also contains
perennial women’s basketball power-
house Connecticut Huskies.

The Big East
- replaced its

old logos (for left)
with these two.

The Big East, with its headquarters
in Providence, R.I., competes in 19
championship events and has over
5,000 athletes.

Over the last few years, Big East
football has not been the national pres-
ence it once was. Not a single Big East
football team won a bowl game in
1997.

There have been rumors of the Big
East’s breakup and the scattering of all
of its teams. Many conferences, like
this summer’s disintegration of the
Western Athletic Conference, home of
the Running Utes of Utah, the team that
lost in the men’s NCAA basketball
ﬁnals to Kansas University.

Big East names All Stars
Pitt has 65 on the Academic list

Pittsburgh,” Pederson said.

Sports Edltor

Last week, the Big East named
its Academic All-Star team. Sixty-
five Pitt student-athletes were
named to the team in most sports.

To earn this honor, a student-
athlete must maintain a 3.0 grade-
point average for both semesters
during the year, participate in a
varsity sport and earn a letter in
that sport.

Athletics Director Steve
Pederson praised the 55 women
and 10 men who received this
honor

“The young men and women
who have been named to this
year’s Big east Academic All-Star
Team are outstanding representa-
tives of the excellence we strive
for at the University of

The list is highlighted by some
big names in Pitt ‘athletics, like
Gina Montesano who was the
women’s basketball team’s leading
scorer last year after returning
from an injury the year before.

Anna Kohler, who this season
broke the Pittsburgh record for the
mile run, also was named to the
team.

New Assistant Athletics
Director Kirk Bruce was proud of
the large number of Panthers on
the list.

“It is increasingly difficult to
receive an honor like this, but 65
kids is a ﬁne showing,” Bruce said.

Sports Edltor

Fox Sports Pittsburgh has named ex-
Pitt employee Larry Eldridge its public
relations director.

Eldridge worked at Pitt until the
beginning of the 1997 season as an assis-
tant athletics director for marketing and
public relations. ,

Most recently, he directed marketing
and communications for JDWarren inc.,
an Internet commerce development com-
pany in Carnegie, Pa.

In his ten years at the University of
Pittsburgh, Eldridge produced an hour-
long video about the ﬁrst 100- years of Pitt

football, Paths of Glory, and launched the
Panthers into cyberspace with Pitt’s ﬁrst
interactive sports program on the Internet.

In other Pitt athletic department news,
Mike Cawood, the former sports informa-
tion director at Belmont University in
Nashville, Tenn., has been named as Pitt’s
new assistant media relations director.

Cawood will work closely with the
men’s basketball team, the track and ﬁeld
team and the football team to till the void
in the media relations director caused by
the departure of former Media Relations
Director Ron Wahl and other rearrange-
ments within the department.
