Bus Drivers Veto Plan,-

Transit Strike

PITTSBURGH AP--Striking bus
and trolley drivers rejected a plan
by the Port Authority Transit (PAT)
district Thursday night to end their
four-day wildcat walkout, a PAT

‘ . spokesman said. He said the offer

was relayed to union members
attending a mass meeting in
Oakland but was rejected flatly.
The Port Authority plan in-
cluded: .
(--A minimum 15—cent per hour
wage hike on a base wage of 5.28.
--Continued arbitration on the
total contract package.
--A complete negotiation pack-

age ready for presentation to the,

union by 4 p.m., Friday.

--Waiving of all criminal pro-
ceedings now pending against the
‘transit union.

“The only condition we are
stipulating,” the PAT spokesman
said, “is that employes return to
their normal work schedule by
12:01 a.m. Friday.”

The spokesman, however, said
the package already had been
rejected by the union,-but he had
no further details on how it was
turned down.

‘Save Pitt Power’

New Campaign

Conserves Energy”

In an updated “Save Pitt Power”
campaign, the University has taken
several steps to cooperate with the
nationwide effort to conserve
energy, Chancellor Wesley Posvar
announced Tuesday.

Currently five steps have gone
into effect. For the winter, the
interior building temperatures will
be maintained at 68 degrees, where
controls permit. ,

Electrical equipment such as
fans and blowers will shutdown at
night and on weekends and
corridor lighting will be reduced by
usingevery other light.

In other steps, refrigeration
equipment is being shutdown,
where possible, and cold air ducts
are being closed.

During Pitt’s winter term,
classes may be grouped in the
same buildings on Saturday
mornings to cut down on heating.

Posvar said in his statement to
the University community, “I
personally invite all of you to share
with us any of your ideas that
would enable Pitt to make an even
greater contribution to this nation-
wide effort.”

Alleged Assault Investigatecl

BY
N.J. BROWN
AND
RICHARD SWARTZ
Allegations of student, campus

- police, and resident assistant

misconduct in an incident in Tower
C early Saturday morning have
prompted formation of a committee,
to investigate the accusations.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
appointed the committee on the
recommendations of Vice-
chancellors Alfred Moye (Student
Affairs) and Joseph Dutton
(Operations). Accordingto Moye,
the recommendation resulted from
an investigation of the incident
which suggested further investiga-
tion was warranted.

Committee members, whom
Moye indicated had been chosen
for their knowledge and expertise,
include: Robert Harper, assistant
dean in the Law School; William
Brown, Law _ School professor;

Gerald Ford Sworn in  
As “40th Vice-president

WASHINGTON AP--Gerald R.
Ford was sworn in as the nation’s
40th vice president Thursday night,
becoming the first man to take
office under the Constitution's 25th
Amendment.

With President Nixon at Ford’s
side and with Mrs. Ford holding
the Bible, Cheif Justice Warren E.
Burger administered the 71-word
oath in the House chamber.
Among those present were.‘ the
Cabinet, members of the House
and Senate, Supreme Court
justices and the diplomatic corps.

The four Ford children were in
the distinguished visitors’ gallery
and the public galleries were
packed.

In a brief speech stressing the
hope for national unity that has
been his theme since his nomina-
tion, Ford said he saw neither
Republicans nor Democrats in the
chamber.

“At this momentiof visible and
living unity,” Ford said, “I see

-only Americans.

“I see Americans who love their
country, Americans who work and
sacrifice for their country and their
children. I see Americans who
pray without ceasing for . peach
among all nations and for harmony
at home.”

In prepared remarks for the
Senate afterward, Ford said he was
grateful to senators for conﬁdence
they expressed “in the capacity of
our -political institutions to meet
new challenges without the ex-
tremes of passion and partisanship

that have brought
republics to ruin.”

Ford was ‘sworn in just over an
hour after the House, by a 387 to 35
vote, completed Congress’ confir-
mation of his nominationias vice
president.

Mazzetta Clanagan, assistant
director of Admissions and Aid;
Pamela Wilson, consultant for the
Resource Center on School De-

former member of Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission;
Jack Karns, director and professor
in the School of General Studies
Criminal Justice Program; and
Louis Murdock, graduate _student
in the counselor education depart-
ment. ,

Moye said a police officer had
been considered for the committee
but that Karns, who
respected by the police community,
was chosen instead.

All appointed members have
accepted through telephone con-
versations with Moye.

‘‘I want them to thoroughly

investigate the charges and
counter-charges,” Moye said. He
noted complaints have been made
concerning the students, campus
policemen, and resident assistant
involved. ’

Moye said he will not dictate the
tactics the committee will use,

them. I will give them names of
individuals. who have knowledge
concerning this (incident).

“I have not personally talked to
the students involved nor have I
talked to the cops."

If the committee can formulate
general future outlines on how to
avoid similar situations, such
information would be welcome,
Moye said. “(But) we want them
to focus on Saturday’s case,”Jhe
added.

Park Grant

Eases Financial Crisis

A major grant to help Point Park
College through its current finan-
cial crisis was announced by the
college's acting president John V.
Hopkins last Thursday.

It is a “challenge” grant of
$150,000 made by the Buhl
Foundation, Hopkins said.

According to a Point Park
spokesman, Dr. Vincent LaBar-
bera, such a challenge-grant is in
effect an invitation by the Buhl
Foundation to other contributors to
follow suit in aiding Point _Park.
during the crisis.

As a result of the Buhl grant,
LaBarbera explained, the college is
“now near the half-way mark in our
financial drive for $500,000." He
called the grant the “largest and
most recent"'contribution to the
college’s current fund drive. ‘A

Dr. David Henderson, director of P
i the foundation, -‘said in: Sunday’s_

Pittsburgh Press he hopes “this
action will stimulate consideration
of the positive aspects and great
efforts made by the college in
meeting its present crisis.”
According to LaBarbera, Hender-
son said the grant supportsthe
displays of faith made by various
individuals, foundations, and th
staff of the college. —
‘Under the terms of the founda-
tion's unrestricted grant, $100,000
will be given to Point Park this
year, and $25,000 in each of the
next two years. The college must

match the grant with similar funds_

from other sources in order to
receive the sum.

Although no time limit exists to ._

raise the funds, LaBarbera said,

much of it has been matched.

already, and‘. the ‘college expects
the total grant to be met within a
short time.

is well- .

' When questioned about how
information obtained by the com-
mittee might affect any criminal
proceedings stemming from the
case, Moye insisted “This in-
formation is for in-house use.” To
date, two students face preliminary
hearings December 10 in Criminal
Court. .

No time limit has been set for the
committee’s final report Moye

said, -but added ‘‘I’m hoping it.’s.

not going to drag out for a long
period of time.”

Bill Kilson, chairman of the
Black Action Society (BAS), ex-
pressed his satisfaction with the
composition of the’committee, but

voiced some reservations regarding .

its intent.
“Right now,
objective of this investigation will

be to focus solely on the effects of ‘H

those actions which the police took

Saturday morning,” Kilson said’

Wednesday, .

. “We of the BAS are concerned '
with the causes which allow such .-

actions to ever occur. We feel

- there are structural defects in the .
explaining “I' don’t want to restrict _

police force itself that must be dealt
with as well."

He referred specifically to the V

screening and hiring practices of
the campus police, the reporting
methods of its officers, and its
union affiliations. Kilson recom-

mended changes be made in these I

areas along with an alteration in
formal police procedure.

“We would also like to see an
office or intermediate stage created
within the University to handle
minor arrests before the suspects
are transferred downtown .to the
Public Safety Building,” he
suggested.

“When such an arrest is made,-

the campus police could hold the
students involved until someone in
the Administration was contacted
and consulted. It might help to
reduce the number of students
who'll have to live with damaging
arrest records.” _

Kilson also criticized" what he
termed “an attitude of solidarity”
that might emerge .among/ the
officers in an effort to protect those
allegedly guilty of excessive use of
force.

“This kind of feeling could prove
detrimental to the investigation
and also place the
welfare in danger,” he said.

“Essentially, it would be the line of 5 if if

defense ‘Let’s stick’ together and
protect ourselves!.” ‘
The reaction from the Chan-

cellor’s office concerning Moye"s’p "
announcement was one of full-.

ﬂedged support. “The Chan-jg
cellor’s concern is that the students

were concerned, and that allega- -

tions were being made,” said

Most universities do not under-

Porcezanski is of the opinion.
however. that many professors
unjustly regard student publishing

the capability of students to author

there are some who have fallen

Subsequently. he feels the
classroom experience for most
pupils is devoid of any incentive or
motivation to entertain creative_

editors of two economic journals

considers his experience a credible
basis for offering these views.

Porcezanski claims. and is
necessary for promotion.

“The university cannot go on
educating people and not give a
danm what happens to them after
graduation. The university has a
commitment to them. They cannot
act as if the graduate student has
nothing to go on to. He must be
made saleable," he believes.

"Departments worry exclusively
about the successful completion of
the master's program and doctoral
thesis. A student must learn how
to publish. become familiar with
the ins and outs.

“More importance must be

delegated to the publication of the
students’ dissertations in outside
journals." Porcezanski explains,
citing the existence of prizes which
are bestowed at some universities
for theses.
I "An award is a form of
encouragement, which is what is
lacking in so many academic
communities." I

A native Uruguayan, Porcezan-
ski describes his book as a

contribution to the political science
and ‘sociology disciplines, not

economics. He also has articles’

_slated for publication in forth-

coming issues of various economic
journals.

“Too many professors. when
they learn one of their students has ,
had something printed, ask ‘Where
did you get the time? You must
have neglected your. classroom
obligations.’ _

“Others think their pupils aren't
capable of such achievement,
based on their in-class perfor-
mance. The professors cannot

always be blamed for this attitude. ~

Students are unexceptional in the
main,” he maintains.

Porcezanski likens any depart-
ment to a “close-knit family”
where there is an appreciable

measure of rivalry, jealousy, and

We, the cosigned, feel that the

_ committee initiated by the Chan-

cellor’s Office to investigate the
incident of early Saturday- morning,
December 1, 1973 involving two
Black students and several mem-
bers of the Campus Police force, is
something that should be praised
and encouraged by all of us here at
the University of Pittsburgh.
However, there are still some
things that still have to be dealt
with for a meaningful solution to
the problem.

If police brutality occurs at the
University, it is because it occurs in
a structure that allows it to. If
police brutality is a problem here,
and if the problem will be solved,
the cause must be investigated as
well as the effect. The committee
must deal with two things:
December 1st’s incident, and its
structural causes. This may
involve a study of these things:

1--The screening process and
hiring practices for campus police-
men;

~2--The process of reporting
incidents;

3--The labor union of, and labor
relations with the campus police-
men;

4--Some of the collective and
individual attitudes held by campus
policemen;

5--Attitudes that are reinforced
by the campus police and univer-
sity administrations, faculty, and
students.

The article, “Grad Students
Assessed Extra Fee for Services”
in the November 30 issue of Pitt
News requires a clarification
regarding the relationship between
the Graduate and Professional
Students Association (GPSA) and
the Student Bar Association (SBA)
of Pitt's School of Law. The SBA
was the only graduate student
organization on campus whose
members’ fees were invoiced by

Pitt before GPSA received campus

BY GEORGE ZRUST

I sit here with my fingers on the
keyboard and my feet in hot water.

Well, not really, but I’m sure it’s
true that at least a few Pitts-
burghers are soaking their feet
after the onslaught of the illegal
strike against the Port Authority
Transit (PAT) by bus" and streetcar
operators.

So far I have nothing too much to
complain about, oddly enough.

But at the risk of sounding a
might bit trite, I will say that a
situation as we are now faced with
brings out both the very best and
the very worst in people.

l’ll get the very worst out of the
way first, and then we can go onto
lighter subjects.

The transit workers are definitely
being inconsiderate children about
this whole affair. ‘Short of throwing
the whole offensive lot into the iron
motel for their disgusting disregard

of the law, I can think of only one‘

other way of letting them know
what people think.

Abolish PAT’s driver courtesy ’

program.
What good are all those smiles if

they only hide an inner disrespect I

for transit patrons?

Perhaps PAT could instead
institute a driver discourtesy
program, whereby all the offensive
grouches would have their portraits
and a list of rotten character traits
portrayed prominently
vehicle.

Forgive me, Philip Murray, but
after all, there is a gasoline
shortage, you know. This is not to
mention a patience shortage.

But enough of the darker side of
the recent turn of events. Onto the
very best.

-Believe it or else, I have found
some really nice people because of
the bus strike. In fact, these people
have been instrumental in helping
me not to belabor the issue of
labor. '

I’ve had a notably, pleasant
experience with hitchhiking. The

Attention.-G. Commuters

Representatives of the commuter
students have pointed out in
discussions with Fred Koloc
(Director of the Advising Center)
and me that there are many
hardships caused for commuter
students by the problems of closed
courses and sections. I guess you
can see that the problem is how to
help out with some extreme cases
without offending the many stu-
dents who have a great range of
problems arranging their lives

around their courses.

We have decided, as a first step,
to try to deal with one speciﬁc
aspect of the problem: If you live at
your family home, if there are
transportation problems to and
from your home, and if the problem
of closed courses is causing you to
leave home or arrive home at
absurdly early or late hours--then
send me a note at this office any
time between now and December
19.

 
 
 
   

1 REHLL7 Don’: THINK THE
Bus s'rR\\<r wuu. AWECY
ANYONE.

  

 

If the numbers of students
contacting this office are somehow
manageable, we will convene an
appeals committee in cooperation
with the Commuter Association,
hear the cases, and try to come up
with solutions. (If the numbers
prove unmanageable, we will
frankly throw up our hands in
despair and go back to the drawing
board.) If this effort works, we may
then examine ways of expanding
the range and kinds of appeals
allowed.

weather was fine, the service was
great (three cars and good
connections. PAT drivers take
note.), and the company pleasant

(a fellow Pitt student).

Most importantly, the autoists
were friendly and_downright nice
people.

I should note that the first driver
was a grievance man from a union
representing a local industrial
railroad.

He recalled an illegal walkout of
some 13 years ago by workers who
disregarded union pleas to stay on

the job, The union payed its share
of ﬁnes and my driver, along with

two other grievance men, went to_

jail. The judge was upset.

Still, the effect of illegality had
not touched those who deserved it.
That makes sense.

I will, however, continue to
concentrate on my pleasant experi-
ences today. As I write, the next
union meeting is reported to be
some 20 hours away.

Perhaps‘ tomorrow I’ll discover
some more pleasant people to think
about.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor:

Mr. Pastorkovich’s dissatisfaction
with Nov. 8th’s debate on abortion
faults itself by not inquiring
enough. Roger Johnson and
Medical Action have answered him
for the most part, though the
answers will become clearer as I
refute Johnson.

I am certainly not an expert on
medicine or statistics, and ad-
mitted it to Roger and MAC. I
wrote the previous letters as
stimuli so WCUC and PHL
spokesmen could, in conjunction
with SHL reps, converse with
Roger ‘Johnson types. Roger’s
entire focus for the debate was to
try to force me to be the onlyone on
the fighting line, so that‘ he could
take advantage of my limitations
and make himself appear as some
courageously conquering Goliath.
What stunning academics!

In his letter (Nov. 30th, ‘73) to
you he neatly skirts around “Legal
Abortions: Early Medical Compli-
cations,” a study by Christopher
Tietzo, a top pro-abortionist.

That researcher bias exists in
pressure group statistics comes
from Evidence by Newman '&
Newman and from “A Scientiﬁc
Critique of Abortion as a Medical
Procedure" by Samuel Nigro...and
not iust on my word, or it would be

as Roger says: “no proof at all.”

Lastly, Johnson himself as shoddy
a scientist as he is a philosopher by
saying the moral aspects of
abortion soon as murder are not
supported by scientific truths, and
that neither scientific truths nor
moral-philosophical truths can
support Pro-life. He is learnedly
confused, for science treats only
empirical facts, and philosophy
goes beyond empiricism, to treat
abstract, supra-sensible concept-
realities. ' ’

Scientifically or empirically, abor-
tion is murder because the sygote
or foetus is human because of
genetic-type individuation by DNA,
which distinguishes a foetus from
any other animal species. The
foetus is livinsnnntanartifact. and
his tissue and blood supplies differ
from the mother’s body.

Because Johnson uses pompously
camouflagod linguistic gymnastics
to veil his conceit, .ignorance,
cowardice, and subterfuge, it
probably applies to all his cohorts,
so as to negate any more dialogue.
Hence. SHL will sponsor during
winter term a
seminars on abortion to over-ride
their escapist pretensions.

Rhodes’ Scholarship Nominees Named

BY MARY BETH KENNEDY

Two Pitt students have been
nominated for Rhodes’ Scholar-
ships. David Blandino and Wesley
McGinnis received the school's
nominations and will be ‘competing
in their home states.

McGinnis applied in his state,
Texas, and faces a preliminary
interview in Houston December 11.

Blandino will be interviewed at
the same time by the Pennsylvania
Rhodes’ Committee in Philadel-
phia.

The scholarships provide two
years of study at England's Oxford
University in any available ﬁeld of
the scholar's choice. McGinnis
expressed an interest in Oxford's
P/PE program, which involves
philosophy, political science, and
economics.

Blandino, a math major, would
pursue medicine, if granted a
scholarship.

Originally contacted two years
ago, McGinnis actually reapplied.
“There was a mishap in my
sophomore year,” he said. “They
thought I was a senior and
contacted me. I applied for the
scholarship and got Pitt’s,nomina-
tion. When it was discovered that I
was a sophomore, I was told to
come back in two years.” ‘

Blandino also got interested in
the scholarship at this time.
“Sophomore year there was a
meeting to aquaint us with the

By Clairol

various types of fellowships and
scholarships available," said
Blandino.

“For the Rhodes’ scholarship
athletics played a big part. and so I
decided to apply for it."

The Rhodes’ applicants are
judged on scholastic ability and
involvement, including athletic
participation. McGinnis said, “I
think that what the Rhodes’
committee is looking for, more than
anything else, is a candidate that is
a worthwhile investment, a well-
rounded individual--they don’t
expect a perfect 4.0.”

Both Blandino and McGinnis are
involved in athletics as well as
maintaining high scholastic
averages. Besides being a leader
in intramural sports,"McGinnis is

president of Pitt's debate team and
a member of two leadership
fraternities.

A varsity football player, Blan-
dino was among 11 US college
athletes cited by the National
Football Foundation and Hall of
Fame last week. The 11 were
recognized for scholarship, athletic
ability, and leadership.’

Thirty-two Rhodes’ Scholarships

are granted in the United States

yearly. The US is divided into eight
districts for the selection, with six
or seven states in each district.
Each state committee nominates
two students to appear before the
district committee which interviews
and appoints four Rhodes’

‘ Scholars. The 32 scholarships will

be announced December 18.

Pill Investigates Charges .

{Continued from Page 1)

“In fact, the issue’s of great
concern to the entire University
community. We want it to be cooly
examined and would like to see the
facts uncovered.”

Coble said the Chancellor had
not talked with Joseph Gil, director
of the Health and Safety Division,
about the incident. to the best of
Coble’s knowledge.

Gil consented to the action that
has been undertaken thus far.
“I’ve concurred with Dr. Moye's

decision completely, and I believe
he has acted legitimately." he said.
“An investigative panel is a good
way to go."

There have been no formal
charges of brutality lodged in the
past with the police, Gil revealed.
He added, however, that in certain
situations regarding past arrests,

there have been some complaints. .

Gil has consulted with a number
of people who were close to the
weekend incident and is now in the

BY BRIAN DUNN

Candidates for the Student
Government Board (SGB) are now
required to submit all rec_eipts from
their campaigns_ under a revised
election code section passed by the
SGB Wednesday.

Bill Kilson, chairman of the
Black Action Society (BAS), said he

was opposed to Article V, Section II‘

of the code. Section II, approved
by the Board last week in an
emergency meeting, set the cam-
paign spending limit at $75, but did
not demand submission of cam-
paign receipts. A

Kilson felt this absence of control
in regard to the campaign
expenditures could result in ﬂa-
grant violations of the $75 ceiling.
In not "providing sufficient safe-

I guards against such violations,
Kilson felt the clause was unfair.

“I feel ,it’s a discrimination in

favor of the rich kid that runs,”
said Kilson. .
V Board member Mike Furick also
opposed the clause saying, “What
good is a law if you can’t enforce
it?"

At Furick’s suggestion, the
Board voted 4-1 to change the
wording of the section from, “It is
highly recommended that receipts
be turned in,” to “Receipts must
be turned in.” Candidates failing
to comply with the code will not be
permitted to take office.

In other business, the Board

voted not to fund remunerations

until at least April. They feel the.

current remunerations system is
ineffective.

President Rege Kaufman out-
lined the alternatives. “We can
either fund them until April or not
fund them at all. Hopefully, in
April a better system will be in
effect."

Furick, who cast the lone vote
against the motion, said remunera-
tions should cover the entire year.

Referring to SGB members, he
said, “Their remunerations should
be a stipend that will take the place
of a job because they’re in office.
' “People really aren't aware of
what you have to do in the summer.
They don't understand the com-
plexity and time involved."

Kaufman also revealed he has
received letters from state Senator
Thomas M. Nolan (D-44 Dist.), and
state Representatives James A.
Romanelli (D-22 Dist.) and Richard
J. Frankenburg (R-34 Dist.),
responding to an SGB resolution
urging support“ of’ legislation
lowering the state drinking age to

.19.

Nolan said, “I have voted for

every 18 year old bill that has been\
placed on the Senate Calendar, and.

will continue to do so, including the
18 year old’s right to purchase
alcoholic beverages.”

Romanelli stated he has con-
tinually supported legislation‘ to

lower the drinking age. “I have
full faith in the youth of our
Commonwealth to be able to cope
with alcoholic beverages...The
drinking age in Pennsylvania
should be lowered," Romanelli
said. .

Frankenburg thanked Kaufman
for his letter but did not indicate
how he would vote on the
legislation.

Author Stresses

Student Publishing

(Continued from Page 2)
has professors who publish little or
nothing. They may be very good
teachers or advance through the
acceptance of administrative posi-
tions.

“They can also be judged on
their extensive work experience in
government or private industry.
But jealousies are there, and this
can discourage student publish-
ing."'

The burden of responsibility
rests with the university, he
asserts. and the stimulus which is
needed to prontote scholarly
publishing must originate from the
faculty. 1

“Even for undergraduates, pub-
lishing is the avenue for creative
thought. It gives the. student
opportunity to express himself
publicly. It is what leads to an
intelligent mind."

And it's not the snapshot ‘variety. People are doing
sports stories. nature stories. portraits—you may _

about which camera is best. ’That's why it's important
for you to know about the Canon F-1. Because it's the

The whole F-1 system includes over 40 lenses and
200 accessories. It's capable of doing virtually
everything in photography.’So whatever idea you
have for a picture. the F-1 has the equipment to make
sure, you get it. ' ' . .
Because it was conceived from the beginning as a
system, it works as a system. All the elements are _
quickly and easily interchangeable. No matter which
lens or accessory you use with the F-1 body you won't
have the feeling that something has been
“tacked on." , '
What's more the F-1 is comfortable to handle.

Years of research went into the design of the F-1 body _

and placement of controls so your fingers fall K
naturally into place. You'll appreciate this comfort
when you're on assignment. It's also an important
thing to keep in mind if you're investing in a-‘camera
you plan to keep a longtime.

years. We make microscope equipment, amateur and
professional movie cameras and TV lenses. It's this
experience that helps make our still cameras the best

of time. ‘

See your dealer for more information. He'll also
show you Canon's other SLR cameras. like the FTb

Bus Drivers Veto Plan,-

Tronsil Strike Continues

(Continued from Page 1)

The mass meeting was the first
hopeful sign in a week marked by

court injunctions, tines, criminal"

citations and the resignations of the
entire 14-member union executive
board after it declined to further
urge rank-and-file members back
to work.

After court orders and pleas from
the union leadership failed to end
the crippling strike, city and county
leaders redoubled efforts Thursday
to convince the 1,700 striking
drivers, members of the Amalga-
mated Transit Union, to return to
work and submit contract disputes
to binding arbitration.

County Commission Chairman
Leonard Staisey said Thursday that
if the drivers went back on the job,
“I can assure them that the Port
Authority Transit (PAT) and the

-county will be more receptive to

their demands.”

Mayor Peter Flaherty, meeting
with, both, sides in a-A-,marathon
session Wednesday night, was said
to have urged the authority to pay
the union a 12-cent-an-hour cost-of-
living increase that would have
fallen due this week.

Flaherty also was reported to
have urged PAT‘ to submit a
proposal to the "membership for a
vote. of

Additional meetings were being

 

held inthe mayor's office Thursday
afternoon.

Meanwhile, Dist. Atty. Robert
Duggan prepared criminal citations
against all drivers that did not
report for work during their
appointed shifts Thursday. By the
end of the day, more than 200
citations had been given to the
county sheriff’s office for delivery
to the striking drivers.

A conviction of criminal con-
tempt brings a maximum sentence
of $100 fine and/ or 15 days in jail.

Also Thursday, a $7,500-a-day
ﬁne. levied on Wednesday against
the union by Allegheny County

Court Judge Richard Wentley,'

went’ into effect.

   

Bus Strike Hurts

Pg h. Businesses

PITTSBURGH AP--Business in
downtown stores has "fallen off as
much as 75 per cent as a result of
the mass transit strike. Jacques
Kahn, executive director of the
Golden Triangle Association, said
Thursday. .

Kahn noted that many downtown
stores “operate in the red 10
months of the year and look to the
Christmas season for a profit.”

And with the possibility that the
strike could end anytime, it’s
impossible for the stores to lay off
workers, Kahn said.

is the word people use to describe opus one’s

new $339 stereo system. It sums up our descripa

tion of this important‘ system, explosive — shat-
tering — earthshaking — clean — realistic — final.’

Why is this system, so different?

Utilizing our 15 years experience in engineering
installing and repairing thousands of component

systems we have designed the new value in the,

$339 price range. We have worked very hard to

make it sound much better and last longer than

any other competitive system.

This great system has been made possible by the
introduction of three new components from
manufacturers who are notorious for their out-
standing quality. Their products do not become
obsolete in a short time.

Advent (the name most feared by competitors in
the speaker business) has introduced the Ad-
vent2 Loudspeaker. It has the overall life—Iike
‘sound of the larger Advent Loudspeaker with

A slightly less deep, deep bas..Still, the Advent/2

costing $58 goes deeper than any competitive
speaker selling below $140. What a tool in
designing great low cost systems.

The KenwV_ood_ KR—2300FM-AM receiver delivers
28 watts RMS with low distortion into the full
range of the Advent/.2 loudspeakers. These are
not junior commando paper claims but real con-

T tinuous power that we can substantiate with

laboratory tests. The Kenwood'KR-2300 has
cleaner high, than any other competitive

receiver.

The BSR 310/AX automatic turntable with
the Shure 75 magnetic cartridge, is an updated
version of a quiet, gentle, and steady unit that
has proven its reliability in thousands of our
more expensive systems. I

If purchased separately the cost of the com—
ponents would be $402. The system price of
$339 also includes connecting cables, turntable
base and cover, an opus one check out, and our

exclusive 3 year guarantee on all parts and
labor.

If you have been unimpressed by the mediocre
”big deal” $400 stereo systems that those super
salesmen around town have been pushing, then
you deserve a refreshing change. Listen to the
natural sound of opus one’s $339 stereo system.
Your reaction will be DYNAMITEI.

SEASON'S GREETING! ! !

BY ALLAN LAZAR

It’s a funny thing about
Sanasardo; he is like a wishing
well. There seems to be a part of
him that is deep and lost. I started
to identify with this feeling during
the imageof The Path, but I wasn't
sure what it was—-the vastness of
outer space?--the engulfment of
the ocean?--the insanity of a
grotesque nightmare?--I couldn't
be sure. Then. “Ice" came on and
I knew that it was the Artic and it
was like being at the end of the

line. There is a void--an
inconquerable. frightening cold
emotion.

By the middle of Ice, I realized
that my body was wrapped around
my knee in the seat, I was grabbing
the back of the chair--a child

watching horror movies. WHAT IS
GOING ON!

This involvement makes me
recall something that Sanasardo
said about himself a year ago.

“I was never particularly attach-
ed to the ballet because I never felt
like a Prince Charming.”

He also spoke about how he
never seemed to fit into the school
structure and never could do much
of anything well until he started
dancing. There were those years
for him where he didn’t quite fit in;
where he was on his own.

Sometimes, feelings gripped at
him and he couldn’t and didn't
want to shake them.

In the beginning of Shadows
where the dancer was Christlike,
seeming sacrificed by having tons
of weight on top of him, these
feelings show. The feeling also
crept up in “Contemporary" of
Small Prayers when I realized that I
was in a desolate NYC apartment
with not much more to call my own
than a curved-neck floor lamp.

It took someone to communicate
these things and it took someone to
train a company of dancers that
seemed to be responding to the
invisable energy bonds in the air.
This is Sanasardo. The well is deep

I

and bottomless, but brimming with
inspiration. - I believe that
Sanasardo sees himself within
Dominique and has choreographed
himself into “Romantic”, a'selec-
tion from Small Prayers. Sana-
sardo seemed to be expressing his
romantic self--but a romantic who
is in love with self-sufficient
expression, discipline, and percep-
tion. Because of the personality
expressed in his dance, Dominique
evidently had complete control and
understanding of this part. I
wanted to cry, but I remembered
the feeling of immersion and
exaltation in the strength of
independent creativity and exis-
tence which follows an under-
standing of an experience.

I fell in love with Dominique at
this point because it represented a
feeling of artistry that is precious.
It is this very feeling that is
inspirational. and to me, this is the
expression of a true artist. The
inspiration is real because of
Sanasardo's deﬁnite connection
between dance and life, and his
dance and his life.

While taking his Master classes.
I not only felt “body-dance

sense of sharing between life and

Michelle Reband dancing with
Sanasardo in “Ice", was an
expression of reality which Reband
handled well. I‘was looking less at
her movements. and feelings more
for her and her dance.

All of the dances were particu-
larly firey and sensitive. Each
showed that he or she meant what
they -were doing. Where there was

Battle Duquesne

In Steel Bowl Tonight

BY BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor

A lot had been said about the
_uptown rivalry between the Pitt
Panthers and the Duquesne Dukes
and this just could be the year that
Buzz Ridl’s Cats have the last word
as the two teams meet tonight in
the annual Post-Gazette Dapper
Dan Steel at the Civic Arena.

The Panthers and the Dukes will
play in the 9 p.m. nightcap while
Clemson will face Florida State in
the ﬁrst game at 7 p.m.

Both Pitt and Duquesne will be
coming off wins--Pitt's confusing
forfeit victorv over Rutgers in
which the actual score has not yet
ofﬁcially been declared, while
Duqesne battled a freeze put on by
Richmond Wednesday night to
score a 48-39 triumph.

It will also be Billy Knight versus
Lionel Billingly in the competition
for the honors to determine the
best individual cager in Pittsburgh.

Last year, Knight won a complete
and decisive victory in that
department from the Pittsburgh
Basketball writers at the end of the
season. If Knight can lead the Cats
to victory tonight, he will probably
repeat the honor hands down.

Knight scored 30 points in a losing
cause against West Virginia last
weekend but_didn’t get the chance
to pour in the points against
Rutgers , as the demonstration
ended that game in the first half.
He ﬁnished with 8 points.

Billingy pumped in 18 points and
pulled down 9 rebounds against
Richmond but the Spiders own
decision to freeze the ball actually
worked against them. The Dukes

shot 43 per cent from the ﬁeld but
only 52 per cent from the charity
stripe. Overall the Dukes were
ragged in their play and coach Red
Manning was not pleased with his
team performance.

In Florida State, Pittsburghers
will get to see a team that took an
18-8 record last year and the year
before that reached the NCAA
finals only to bow to UCLA, 81-76.
In that championship game, the
Seminoles Larry McCray, a sopho-
more at the time, played the
Bruins’ Bill Walton to a virtual
standstill before foul trouble took
the edge off his individual
abililities.

Florida State coach Hugh Durham
has the highest respect for
Clemson, saying that this years’
Clemson squad will be the best that
school has had in some time. His
respect might also stem from the
fact that the Seminoles have not
had a really tough opponent in the
pair of games they have played so
far. Both have been decisive home
victories over teams the FSU was
expected to beat. This will be the
first road excursion for the
Seminoles and their only swing into
the North ‘East of the season.

The Dapper Dan Classic is once
again assured of having a home
town, team in the ﬁnals after the
scheduling committee found a few
years ago that trying to get a
Pitt-Duquesne matchup in the
ﬁnals wasn't always a sure bet.

With a win over the Dukes,
Pittsburgh could very well face
their toughest game of the season
to date, if not all year long, in the
Seminoles.

Johnny Majors will be leading

his -Pitt Panthers into their ﬁrst
Bowl Game since 1956ron Friday,
December 21, when the Cats meet
the Arizona State Sun Devils.

For Arizona State, it marks the

school’s third straight appearance
in the three year-old contest,
earned by winning the Western

Athletic Conference. Last year, the
Sun Devils defeated Missouri to

‘win the Bowl. Arizona State will be

hosting the Panthers to a week of
festivities which will be culminated
by the nationally televised game.

Majors gave the Cats a week off
following the Penn State game, but
urged them to keep in shape by
running on their own. This week
consists of conditioning workouts
for the Panthers, in which there

_ will be no contact drills.

The Panthers will work in pads
next week, including a one hour

"scrimmage on Friday, December

14. The squad will take off for the
land of the Sun on Sunday,
December 16, and will practice in
Tempe, Arizona that afternoon.
The teamwill continue to practice
that week in Arizona, although
they will be diverted by numerous

banquets and luncheons in their
honor. '

“We are going to have a good
time, in addition to preparing for a
football game,” said Majors.
“This game is a well-deserved
reward for the outstanding effort of
his team, especially the seniors.”

Majors and his entire staff spent
last week recruiting prospects for
next season. At a cocktail party at
the Hilton Hotel Friday, only
assistant head coach Jackie Sherrill
was in attendance.

The Fiesta Bowl has come under
some criticisim for selecting Pitt, a
team with four losses and a tie, to
compete. Bowl Chairman, George
Taylor refuted the charges, saying,
“we are an up and coming bowl
game and Pitt is an up and.coming
football team.” ,_ -

Majors had said that if Pitt didn’t v
get a bowl bid, there’d be seven or
eight less exciting teams playing.

Other factors that led to Pitt’s
consideration are the wide-spread
reknown of Majors and Tony
Dorsett, who became the first
freshman in 29 years to make the
Associated Press’s All-American
team.

Supporting Taylor’s claim that
Pitt is an up and coming team,
NCAA stats just released show Pitt
the most improved team in the
country, winning ﬁve more games
than last season and losing six less.

Pitt has not won a bowl game
since the 1936 Rose Bowl, when it
shut out Washington, 21-0. With
the way Majors has. turned losing
streaks around here, the Fiesta
Bowl shapes up as one of the more
exciting bowl games of the year.

Grapplers Lose 35-5;

BY VINCE DI NARDO

George Calcagnini was standing
and he was ready--eager in fact--for
his 190 pound wrestling match
against Michigan’s Dave Curby
last night at the Pitt Field House.
His team lost badly to Michigan
33-5, but what happened to him
had to please him somewhat.

A moment or so before George
took the mat, he kept looking over
his shoulder. Maybe he was
looking to see if Craig Tritch was
sneaking up on him. But alas,
Tritch was nowhere-in sight‘ and
Calcagnini at long last had ceased
being a shadow. _

Craig Tritch was the 190 pound
last yearland for the last two years
had forced Calcagnini to be a sub.
He helped Tritch become last
year’s Eastern Wrestling champ, in
fact. ' /

“George is very strong and a
very able‘ wrestler,” his. coach,
Dave Adams, said last week.
“They always had extremely close
wrestle offs last year and I can’t
remember the number of times
their matches went into overtime.
Craig became a better wrestler as a
result. George eventually helped
him win the Easterns.”

Late last week, Calcagnini did a '_
pretty good job of predicting his

fate and if what he says is true, he
actually didn’t lose.

“I saw curby wrestle two years
ago,” George said then, “He’s a
good wrestler. But his thing is
musceling people and I don't think
anyone can muscel me.”

Curby, a Junior Olympian this
past summer, had his hands full as
predicted. He eeked past
Calcagnini 5-4 by scoring a

third ranked

takedown with 1:34 left in the
match. Calcagnini tried to vain to
escape the rest of the way, but he
did have Curby on the ropes most
of the nine minutes. Curby scored
a quick takedown and Calcagnini
escaped for a 2-1 lead. Then
George put Curby in a predicament
for a 3-2 lead. After Curby
escaped, George did the same with
2:08 left regain the lead. ‘Further
indication of a close meet is shown
in the fact that no riding time was
awarded.

Calcagnini, who likes wrestling
because of the one-on-one matchup
and because there are no politics
involved, doesn’t think one point
means much in his sport.

“In a real close match, what’s
one point. It’s no proof that a guy
is a better wrestler. If I lose a close
one to Curby I won’t be
disappointed,” he said last week.

Things aren’t going to get‘ easier‘
for George as the schedule takes its
course. He will have a tough match’
with Greg Soerbel, the 190 National
Champ last year, of Oregon State
this weekend in New York.

“-I'd like to win all my matches,”
Calcagnini noted. “But unless I
get blown off the mat, I won’t be
disappointed. I'm not going to be
overly concerned with my dual
meet record, but by the time the-
tournaments roll around, I think I’ll
be in a position to win the Easterns
too.”

Though the tournaments are the
eventual goals of all of Dave
Adam’s grapplers, the way they
performed last night might make it
a tough rode there. Michigan,
in wresling too,
seemingly took it to Adams’ young

wrestlers and only freshman Rande
Stottlemyer was the only one who
came out on top. Stottlemyer was
in control from the start and won
going away,'over another highly
regarded frosh--Rich Valley--by a
10-4 decision. ,

Jeff Minerd (177) was reversed
with four seconds left and was tied
4-4 by John Rayan.

“I take the blame for that,”
Adams said. “I should have told
Jeff to let him (Ryan) escape to give
up the point and taken it from
there.”

Theturning point, according to
Adams, came in the 134 match,
involving Pitt's Bob Bailey and Bill
Davids of Michigan.

Bailey putting on a great
offensive show against a man‘ that
had ﬁnished fourth in the NCAA
tournament last year, when he lost
his momentum and was decisioned

7-5. He led most of the way. From
that point on, Michigan romped.

Even though the Pitt Hockey Club
claimed its second consecutive

I " - league championship last year, the

season ended with a large question

' mark looming in the eyes of Pitt

skaters. The team Pitt was
supposed to meet for the title,
Carnegie-Mellon University. could
not compete in the final contest due
to the fact that the game was
scheduled during their spring term
break and Pitt wound up playing

I ’ Indiana.

C-MU had gone undefeated in
three meetings with Pitt. a win and
a tie in league play and another
exhibition win in the ﬁrst annual
West Penn Tourney. but did not
protest the date of the champion-
ship game until a week before the
contest was scheduled. The
league commissioner at the time,
Sam Orr. ruled that the date for the

E‘ag"él14—TH:lSYIl"ITT NEws—'Friday, December 7, 1973

game would stand and C-MU was
just out of luck.

But it's a new season now and the
long awaited rematch between the
Tartans and Pitt is finallygat hand.
The two teams will meet Sunday
night at 9 p.m. in the second half of
the WPIHA second hockey double-
header at the Civic Arena.

To say the least. sentiments are
running‘ very strong among the Pitt
skaters and a win over C-MU could
very well set the team rolling
toward an undefeated season. not
only in league play.

Both squads have experienced a
slight change in their respective
lineups, but the Tartans still have
the two stars of the team that seem
to give Pitt the bulk of the
competition. Goalie Jeff Hart, who

skaters that face him, is off to
another hot start in the C-MU nets.
Hart registered a shutout in his
first outing. over St. Vincent, and
held C.H. Bender and the
Duquesne Dukes to four goals in a
wild affair last week at the Arena.

Mike Kenworthy, the Tartans’
speedy forward, will return to test
the Pitt defense. Besides those two
particular Tartans, the C-MU
squad should put forth their usually
solid team performance in what has
to be billed as the most important
game of the young season. Pitt
holds a two point lead over C-MU
for first place with a game in hand.

The Pitt lineup has changed
somewhat from last year, but
where the skaters lost some key
personnel a few new faces have
popped up and are proving that this
year's team may very well be equal
or superior to any. of their
predecessors.

Charly Hagins has stepped into
Billy Glanville’s skates as first line

‘ center and currently leads the team

in scoring with seven goals and six

assists for 13 points. Freshman
Rick Vernon now occupies the wing
that Phil Clarke skated last season
and he trails Hagins with eight
goals and three assists for 11
points. I

“We have been waiting for this
game for a long time,” Pitt center
Joe Testa said. “And we’re going
to prove who's the better team once
and for all.”

Kent State

The Pitt women's swim team will
be traveling to Kent State today for
what they hope to be their second
win of the season. Last year, the
“Piranhas" defeated Kent by a
score of 59--45 and are hoping to
match that performance.

One problem. though, is that the
women will be short--handed for
this meet. Due to illness,‘ the
Piranhas are presently without

Vicki Coleman, freshman free-
style sprinter appears ready to take

will be felt. Martin is a butter-flyer
and co-captain Sue Price may be
Pitt's only entry in the 50-yard

The Piranhas also regret the loss

family circumstances, had to drop .

Swerdlow Gives Gymnasts
‘Edge’ In Opener Sat.

BY VINCE DI NARDO
Ed Swerdlow is a Gynmast--you
know. one of those guys who wears
suspenders and works out on
ghastly things called ‘apparatus.’
What! You didn't know there was
such a thing at Pitt? Well there is.
Swerdlow is living proof of that.
He's been on the team the last four
years.
Every day. between three and six
in the afternoon. Swerdlow can be

major, Lipp will be in France for
the Winter Term.

Diving assistant Barb Schaefer.
Women's National AAU Cham-
pion, is still optimistic towards the
diving season. “I see no "reason
why our divers won't continue their
success," she commented. Fresh-
man Bert Snoznik and veteran
Sharon Schoelkopf will be diving
for’. Pitt.

Strong performances are expected
by the Pitt swimmers and divers.
“Manyteam and personal records
should fall this meet," predicted
Assistant Coach Kate Mathison.
“It should be an exciting meet and
we should come out on top."

Team Captain Mamie Heretick is
the most likely to break a team
record--especially in the 200-yard
freestyle. *She has already
qualiﬁed for Easterns in this event
and is close to National qualifying
time.

Also in the 200-yard freestyle are
senior Anne Wallisch and Michelle
Knoll; who are expected to drop
their times in this event consider-
ably and pull in some points for the
Piranhas. I

Freshman Angie Lopez has
already qualiﬁed for National's in
both breastroke events, and will be
a key swimmer against Kent.
Backing her upstrongly will be
Annamarie Crelli. To date. Lopez
and Crelli have consistently taken
first and second place.

“Pitt’s freestyle relay has already
qualified for Nationals while the
medley is close and should qualify
for the championship meet to-
morrow.

In the 50-yard butterﬂy, Price is
within three-tenths of a second
from Nationals. and will be relied
upon for a good showing. especially
if she will be the only Pitt swimmer
in the event.

Backstroke, formerly the Pitt
women's weak point, is looking
stronger. Mickey Chamberlain and
Linda Bender are lowering their
timesconsistently and should rack
up many points for the Piranhas
tomorrow. _ '

Possibly a key swimmer for this
meet will be utility swimmer,
Eloise Kester. Kester has swum a
variety of events from the 100-yard
backstroke and the 100-yard
individual medley to the 200-yard
freestyle, always picking up
needed points for Pitt.

found in a corner of the Gymnast's
working area with two or three
women gymnasts huddling around
him and laughing. Being a
gymnast might have some publicity
shortcomings. but Swedlow does
alright otherwise.

“Ed is a mature guy." lg Perez
says of Swerdlow. who looks more
like the lead singer of a hard rock
group--with his corkscrew hair--
than anything else. “He's got his
head together and he's very
popular with the girls and
everybody else up here."

Ed is probably not the best
all-around gymnast Perez has on
his team this year, but as the team
opens its hopeful season this
weekend at Massachusetts, he will
be an important figure--not neces-
sarily physically, but emotionally.
Swerdlow will be out to make sure
his team doesn’t get freaked out.

Perez is in his first year at the
Gymnastics helm, the leader of the
downtrodden program. He will
take four freshmen into the meet
with him to do most ofthe work and
four of his other five performers
have never been involved in varsity
competition before. In fact only
three others have, the most
experienced being Swerdlow.

"I know what college competition
is like." Swerdlow noted. “These
guys don't exactly know what's
going to happen. I'm going to
make sure they don't become
frustrated and don't get down on
themselves. That's an edge I
have." '

Gus Papantonio, Don Stevenson,
and Rob Pasterick will be the three
freshmen All-Around men Swerd-
low will be keeping an eye on. The
trio will compete in the six
events--the floor exercise, pommel
horse, rings vaulting, paralell bars
and the horizontal bar--and will be

complemented by Larry Hahn,
another freshman, on the pommel
horse and paralell bars, Mark
Strahler, Cliff Custer, and Jim
Kolesar on the rings [Kolesar will
also compete in the paralell bars]
and Mark Boyett and Swerdlow as
the floor exercise specialists.

Perez. who will coach his first
meet as a head man is not going to
be discouraged in spite of what
might happen.

“I will be feeling with them."
Perez said. .“lt's their freshman
year and it will be my freshman
year. I'm not going to be
discouraged no matter what might
happen." '

Massachusetts has a strong team,
one. that scores about 154 points a
meet.

"We can't score 154 yet." Perez
said. “I'm hoping we score either
in the high 30's or low 40's. If they
break we could win." I 2

Swerdlow remembers his first
competition. It was at Southern
Connecticut. against Pan American
Champion John Crosby. Crosby
did some kind of phenomenal trick
ﬁlled routine and Swerdlow was
awed. He had to compete against
THAT! ,

“I’m going to do my best to make
sure these guys aren’t awed like
the way I was when I first saw
Crosby,” he said.

Swerdlow does not compete in
gymnastics for reasons other might
deem worthy. “I like it because it's
fun." he says. “I don't know what
I'd do with myself "otherwise. I
think you can impress a judge with
a simple routine done well much
more so than with a tough routine
done sloppily.

‘'1 do a simple routine and I try to
do it well. I'd like to be perfect, but
I don't try hard at it. I'm having
fun. That's the important thing."

Temple Hosts   Tankers

“BY YAIER LEHRER

The Panther swim team will be
traveling to Philadelphia today for
their season debut against the
Temple Owls tomorrow afternoon.
This is their first dual meet and
they want to win it badly.

“I think they're really going to
come at us hard this year,” said

O ’ coach Dick Bradshaw, “especially

since we surprised them and beat
them here last year. They had a
tradition of beating us before last
year, and they want to get it back."
_ Temple has some of the talent to
do it with, too. Tony Chamille,
diving both the one and three
meter boards has the potential to
take two ﬁrst places. Pitt also has
good divers, though, with Jack
Garrow, Jeff Miller. Tom Faytol,
and Martin Stanley ready to give
Chamille a run for his money. The
Pitt divers beat him at the Penn
State Relays and they have a good

0 - chance of doing it again.

The Owls are also quite strong in

the individual medley with swim-
mers Mike Lowler, Wayne King,
Tim Elliot, but Lowler may not
swim in the event because King
and Elliot are the traditional IM
swimmers for the Owls.

The Panthers have a slight edge in
the 500 and 1000-yard distance
freestyle events with Jerry Demuro
and Walt Young. The Owls don’t
have anyone really outstanding in
these events and the Cats should
be able to run away with the race.

The big question mark in the meet
is what the Temple freshmen are
like. This is the ﬁrst dual meet of
the season for both teams and
neither one has access to scouting
reports on the other’s prospects.

The 400-yard medley relay for the

Cats should not face any serious
competition as they won the Penn
State Relays with no one coming
within four seconds of their time.
The team of Wallace, Templin,
Natali, and Scheppner should be
able to coast to Ayictory in the race.
“This is ‘going to be atough
meet," says Bradshaw, “but the

team really wants to win it, and I
believe they will.”
