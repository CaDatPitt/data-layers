MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers
begin with
easy Win

Nate Barnes
Stajf Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team be-
gan its season in dominant fashion
Friday, dismantling the Mount St.
Mary’s “40 minutes of mayhem” en
route to an emphatic 80-48 victory
at the Petersen Events Center.

Redshirt junior Talib Zanna led
all scorers with 20 points on 10-
for-12 shooting, while senior point
guard Tray Woodall guided the
Panthers’ offense with 14 points
and six assists in 31 minutes of ac-
tion — the most of any Panther
player that night. Freshman center
Steven Adams made his regular-
season debut as a starter, scoring
eight points, pulling in eight re-
bounds and blocking four shots.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
was pleased with his team’s per-
formance in the season opener.

“First game, I thought we did
some really good things,” Dixon
said after the game. “I thought the
two teams played really hard. It
was an entertaining game to watch.
The energy was terriﬁc.”

The energy the Panthers
brought to the ﬂoor resulted in 16
Mountaineer turnovers, off which
the Panthers scored 24 points. Pitt
also frequently got out on the fast
break, as evidenced by the 20
points the team scored in transi-
tion.

Woodall said getting easy buck-
ets in transition and pressuring the
ball defensively were two strate-
gies the team stressed in practice
this past week.“We wanted to stop

Experts:
Universities
susceptible
to hacking

Pete Blais
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Pitt’s computer networkwas allegedly
attacked twice in the past six months,
and cybersecurity experts in the area
aren’t surprised.

The two alleged hacking incidents
— one inthe summer and one in Oc-
tober — of Pitt’s computer network
have led to conflicting reports from
the University and outside experts on
whether such breaches would have
left evidence of inﬁltration.

‘With no background of Pitt’s
system, several experts weighed in
on the susceptibility of a university
computer system, with manysaying
that universities are more vulnerable
to hacking. .

William Claycomb, the lead re-
search scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s
Software Engineering Institute, said
universities are susceptible to hacking
because their networks are typically
very open.

“University systems are widely
open to the Internet. They’re usually
not behind a protective shield, and in
some cases, they’re speciﬁcally against
this protection,” Claycomb said.

During the month of October
alone, two Universities experienced
incidents of possible hacking. Ac-
cording to The Fauman, Florida
A&M’s student newspaper, fellow
Florida institute Northwest Florida
State University’s systemwas hacked.
In a separate incident, The Athens
Banner—Herald reported thatthe per-
sonal information for nearly 8,000
former and current employees at the
University of Georgia may have been
compromised by a hacker. Timothy

Veterans Day Parade evokes memories, shws of support

Kathleen Fennell
For The Pitt News

Spectators lined the sidewalks of Liberty Av-
enue and Stanwix Street in Downtown Pitts-
burgh, waving American ﬂagsto honor and
thank veterans and their families as they pa-
raded through the streets.

The 93rd annual Veterans Day Parade,
which kicked of Saturday at 10:30 a.m., pre-
sented an opportunity forveterans and civilians
alike to reﬂect on the importance of recognizing
those who have protected the United States
throughout history.

Paul Geche, a Pittsburgh native and avia-
tion technician during the end of the Vietnam
War, is thankful for the Veterans Day Parade
because it supplies a level of recognition that
he and his fellow veterans didn’t experience
when returning from Vietnam.

“I think it gives everybody a boost, espe-
cially coming off of Vietnam. There were no
parades when those guys came home like there
are now, and it gives especially us Vietnam vet-
erans a chance to get together and congratulate
each other and have a good time talking about

“I wouldn’t trade it for anything. It was

ﬁlll of life experiences,” he said, adding with

a chuckle, “You’ll see because you’re walking

around free that we did apretty good job. We’ve
never been attacked by any Soviet submarine
missiles.”

Michelle Hickman and her three children
watched the parade while holding signs that
read, “Thank you Pappy” and “We love you”
to honor both Hickman’s father, a Vietnam
veteran who served from 1967 to 1969, and the
children’s uncle who served in Iraq.

They also held a sign to honor Bowe Berg— ‘
dahl, an army prisoner of war in Afghanistan
since 2009. .

Hickman praised the parade and the rein-
forcement it provides for veterans. —

“It deﬁnitely shows overwhelming support
for the veterans,”~she said. I

While some veterans watched the parade‘
from the sidewalks, others marched down the
streets.

different people.”

SGB presidential candidate Natalie Rothen—
berger said thatwhile the process hasbeen hec-
tic, her slate works as ateam to stay positive and
reachouttoasmany student groups as possible.
Even Hurricane Sandy and poor Pittsburgh
weather cannot prevent the candidates from
running between different student groups.

“We had ﬁin with it,” Rothenberger said.

“We were running with umbrellas and rain 4

boots, and then I’d switch to heels. It’s Pitts-
burgh, so I think we’re all kind of used to it.”

Each campaigning group follows a similar
process as its members approach student orga-
nizations — candidate introductions, initiative
overviews and then an open forum for ques-
tions. According to Pitt’s website, the Student
Organization Resource Center certiﬁes more
than 400 undergraduate and graduate student
organizations. A -x

As Rothenberger and the Steel and Stone
slates spoke with Tau Beta Pi in Benedum Hall,
opposingpresidential candidate Gordon Loud-
erback and the Forbes slate spoke with the

, Triangle Fraternity in Posvar Hall.

Louderback said that, in total, his slate’s
three speeches last about ﬁve minutes and that
he and his slate try to tailor their information
to their audience’s interests.

Forbes slate running mate Amelia Brause
said that the biggest challenge throughout the
campaigningprocess, which began more than
two weeks ago, is time management. ‘

Tomjabro of the Fifth slate agreed, saying
that while carnpaigningis fun, it’s far from easy._

“The hardest thing, and I’m sure every
candidate can attest to this, is that time man-
agement is pretty difﬁcult,” he said. “While
campaigning is a lot of fun, you are campaign-
ing roughly from Sunday through Thursday
anywhere froms or6 p.rn. to 10 or11p.m., and
on top of that you have schoolwork.”

Jabro said that his slate has enjoyed cam-
paigning and that this week is crunch time,
meaning “you’ve got to give everything you’ve
got and show what you are able to do” leading
up to election day Thursday.

Hans Kessler and Tim Larkin of the Kessler-
Larkin 2012 slate said it is a little more difficult
to reach out to the same number of students
with their slate of two candidates in compari-
son to what they refer to as the “mega slates,”
or those slates consisting of three candidates
that also work with another slate of three can-

didates. _ 1 e ’ e ' 1 .

“We are technically running on‘a- slate, but
we like to think of it as two independent can-
didates pulling our resources together to put
ourselves on a more even ground with the larger
slates,” Kessler said.

Larkin said they are on a slate because that’s _
“how it’s done at the moment” but that they
work to remind students of their ability to vote
for individuals rather than entire slates.

Kessler said they have used social media
outlets such as Facebook to include “fun fact”
sheets and baby pictures as part of “Throwback
Thursday” on their slate’s page.

“We feel that it’s more personal,” he said.
“While we may have far less ‘likes’ on our page,
we deﬁnitely had funwith it.” ‘

Sowmya Sanapala of the Stone slate said
the campaign has not only forced her to run
around in heels more in the past few weeks
than ever before, but it has also allowed her to
better understand her running mates and the
student body. 1 ‘

“It’s been going great. Iwasn’t familiar with
how [SGB campaigning] worked before, so it’s
been an interesting experience. And I feel like
it helps us, as aslate, understand whataBoard"
position will mean for us,” Sanapala said. “You
never really sit down and think about how many
student organizations there are and howvaried
their focuses and priorities are. It’s certainly

— been enlightening in that respect.”

Mary Mallarnpalli of the Pitt United slate
said the slate has been able to speakwith more
than 50 student organizations so far in the
campaigning process, and the candidates have
received helpﬁtl feedback from the groups.

“[Campaigning] has made us much better
public speakers and has helped us get to know
campus better,” Mallampalli said. “This has
been a great opportunity for my slatemates
and I to get to know student groups that we
may not have had the chance to speak to, or
been  with, otherwise.”

Their treks across campus in hopes of earn-
ing votes and a position on the 2013 Student
Government Board have become a nightly run
that the candidates embrace as they near the
election this week.

“Campaigning feels like a marathon, but '

when you actually think about it, it’s just a
sprint,” Rothenberger said.

The Coast Guard Auxiliary serves as a
backup for the United States Coast Guard by
assisting with operations on the nation’s rivers.

Unglo expressed his gratitude to the other
volunteers in the parade. _

“I think it’s wonderful, and it’s great; They’re
deﬁnitely supportingthe veterans of the United
States. We keep everyone free, so you’ve got to
make [the parade] good,” he said.

He also commented on the effect the parade
has on veterans and their families.

HACKING

Shimeall, a senior member of the same CMU SEI
staff, said it’s necessary for a university system
to be open in order to share such avast amount
of information. ‘

“Universities are all about research and
dissemination in order to achieve their goals,”
Shimeall said.

Because Pittwill not comment on the details
of its computer system, it’s difficult to gauge just
how open or protected the system is. ’

However, Claycomb explained that it canbe
diﬂicult for auniversity to share its information
publicly while also keeping private information
out of harm’s way. For instance, Pitt might want
to spread information to students about staying
healthy this winter, but at the same time hope
to keep students’ information about grades and
ﬁnancial records private.

“With personal identiﬁcation information, i

you have to protect it with a certain kind of se-
At the same time, this information has to be
released and shared amongst students so they
can access their classes and payment informa-
tion. So there has to be this portal between the
protection and the sharing,” Claycomb said.
Another aspect to consider is the size of Pitt’s
network: Thousands of students and faculty use
the network every day. Shimeall said a large
network has its advantages and disadvantages
in terms of staying protected. ’ ,
“Pitt is so large, meaning they have the staff
to support their system and regulate its safety,
but at the same time, all of that information is

) out there,” Shimeall said.

Pitt remains mum on what happened injune
when two hackers affiliated with the hacking
group Anonymous allegedly inﬁltrated Pitt’s
computer system. _

Warner Mariani, the defense attorney for
26-year-old Brett Hudson oﬁ Hﬂlsboro, Ohio,
who pled guilty at the end of October for post-
ing anonymous You'I‘ube threats in April and
May, said his client was successﬁil in extracting
information. Alexander Waterland, 24, of Love-
land, Ohio, was also charged with conspiringto
commit interstate extortion using a computer,

but he pled not guilty.
University spokesman Robert Hill contends

 that, “As previously indicated, the University

found no evidence of a breach of Pitt’s computer
information system.”

Because the matter is still under the author-
ity of the criminal justice system, Pitt can only
provide limited information.

One Pitt student seemed concerned but
unfazed by the potential repercussions of a
breached Pitt network.

“I have a pre-existing opinion that people
will ﬁnd out about my information,” said Bill
Krieger, a graduate student studying security
information. He also said he was surprised that
Pitt was targeted, but he was not surprised that
the Universitywas possibly breached.

Albert Whale, director of security at ABS
Computer‘Technology Inc., said hackers have
the advantage over security professionals.

“A big advantage of hackers are time and
resources. If one guy can’t do it, he’ll get his
friends to help. Security professionals have to
be right all the time. The hackers only have to
be right once,” Whale said. ’

Shimeall painted a similarly grim outlook,
saying, “If a hacker wants one thing or the other,
they’ll be able to get it because they’ll ﬁnd aﬂaw.
No security system is perfect.” ’

Typically, Shimeall said, there are three ~

broad categories that delineate how a hacker
can inﬁltrate a system such as Pitt’s. Oneis called
social engineering, where a hacker will send
you something that looks persuasive enough to
click on. Once you do, the hacker gains access
to your information.

Hackers can also corrupt either a website
located at Pitt or visited by someone at Pitt.
Either way, a hacker can inﬁltrate Pitt’s system.

Also, hackers can download their own soft-
ware into a system in order to corrupt it.

Mariani said inaninterview earlierthis year
thathis client “set up alink that allowed his co-
conspirator to download information from the
University of Pittsburgh.”

And this attack could have been directed
toward any computer system.

“If Anonymous had a gripe with Pitt, I could
see them using their resources to leverage an
attack in order to gain access,” said Whale.
“Hypotheﬁcally speaking, we’re all vulnerable.”

VETERANS   .

They’re ﬁghting for freedom everyday and ev-
eryone here is safe, so it’s good for morale for
sure,” Unglo said. _

High school bands from all over the Pitts-
burgh area marched in the parade, playing
patriotic songs for the veterans.

Iceburgh, the Pittsburgh Penguins’ mascot,
even made an appearance early in the parade,
decked out in a camouﬂage jersey and elicit-
ing shouts of “We want hockey back!” from
the crowd.

Several Reserve Officer Training Corps
groups, including the West Mifﬂin Air Force
Junior ROTC and the Penn Hills Navy Junior
ROTC, also marched in the parade.

While neither Pitt ROTC nor Pitt’s Student
Veteran Association marched in the parade,
SVA plans to honor those who serve in the U.S.

armed forces during an on-campus event today.

Starting at 8:30 a.m., the SVA will honor

Veterans Day by reading the names of all the
service members who lost their lives during
current wars and military operations. The event
will take place in the William Pitt Union andwill

December graduates only have a
month to complete bucket lists

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

It’s that time of year. As the seasons
change and the semester starts to
wind down, we are again whirled into
a new stage of life.

This is especially true for seniors
graduatingthis December. I’m one of
those seniors, and I amterriﬁed —~ of
being out of college, being done with
school and being in need of a job. I
know I’m not alone.

So in the name of living it up dur-
ing the last few weeks of ourﬁnal col-

this one goes out to you: The Obscure

 mightstand in the front of the

classroom, teaching you everything

you missed when you skipped your -

lecture, it doesn’t mean they aren’t
people too. Maybe they play an in-
strument or are even in a jazz band.
Or perhaps they play on an amateur
sports team. Your TAs have lives just
like you, and once you’re out of their
classroom, you can go back and be-
their friend!
Go dancing  but not at a bar

‘For a lot of students, “going out
dancing” means heading to a bar
on the weekend and breaking it
down to some D_]’s sweet beats with
your friends or with strangers. But
wouldn’t it be ﬁm to do something
new? Try swing dancing at Swing
City in Squirrel Hill or salsa dancing
at Mexico City Downtown or just go
to Pitt’s Diwali celebration and learn
raas. Pittsburgh is a culture—ﬁlled
area with countless places around
the City to explore new kinds of danc-
ing that might just be more fun than
the awkward and cramped grinding
that happens at the bars.

between Thanksgiving and school

I Andrew Kaback
Columnist

It’s a time—honored tradition across
campuses throughout the United
States. Late in November, the uni-
versities shut down for a few days
as the country comes together for a
Thanksgiving feast.

OK, so maybe we do the opposite
of come together and all go our sepa-
rate ways, but the point remains that
there’s some sort of a respite from
school.

Most people look forward to this
break for quite a while. After weeks
and weeks of classes bringing us
down, we feel like we need a little
bit of time off.

I’m going to be as honest as I can
possibly be -— I love Thanksgiving. I
love it for one particular reason: the
food. Now, I know that might not
come as a huge surprise to many

people -- after all, the food is incred-
ible. Seriously, can you even get stuff-
ing during other months of the year?

Like the rest of America, student
groupswill celebrate Thanksgiving to
the max. I’m sure that many organiza-
tions and clubs are in the process of
putting together adinner, and dining
halls generally have a celebration as
well.

The powers at the University give
you a chance to celebrate too.. There
will be some time off for each of us,
allowing for a chance to re—evaluate
where we stand in our classes. It
gives us the opportunity to examine
our grades, to formulate what our
next semester will look like and to
see what is left to accomplish before
ﬁnals.

Wait, ﬁnals? Finals are in a couple
of weeks? Just over two weeks? Oh,
and is every major project that I for-

i got about due the week we get back?
I guess that’s cool.

Let me tell you, it happens. After
all of my semesters here at Pitt, I can
assure you ofone thing: Thanksgiving
comes atthe worst possible time. It is
right before the climax of your stud-
ies -— the rising action that keeps you
tented up in the library. It’s so decep-
tive. Especially because mid-Decem-
bercanseem so far off, Thanksgiving
shows up when we’re all caught in a
trance of blissful ignorance.

So let me be, possibly, the ﬁrst
to warn you about the dangers of
Thanksgiving thinking. Don’tfall into
the trap! The way I see it, there are
only afew possible methods to avoid
what I’m terming “The Thanksgi '
Trance.”

The thing is that the most obvi-
ous way to avoid this issue isn’t likely
to happen: moving Thanksgiving. I
don’t hate it. Late November is cold,

career. Finishing four years of college — or
three and a half if you’re graduating early -
means we should reward ourselves every so
often and live it up at a bar on a weeknight.
Heck, stay until last call.

Have a back-to-back-to- “Back to the
Future” night

Take a night — three-day weekends and
ﬁnals week are great times for this — grab
some pillows and snacks and watch all three
“Back to the Future” movies in a row. Don’t like
“Back to the Future”? Well, ﬁrst of all, we can
never be friends -—— just kidding. You can also
watch “Indiair1a_]ones,” the original “Star Wars”
or any other classic movie trilogies, as long as
you watch them» back to back. You just won’t
have as awesome a name for your movie night.

Get your picture on Hemingway’s wall

This one is simple. Really guys, all you have
to do is ask.

Watch a Quidditch game

Everybody raves about the football games in
the fall and the basketball games in the spring,
but those teams can leave us disappointed.
Instead, you should try attending the games
of a team that has honored its school through
consistent and excellent performances at the
World Cup every year. That’s right, the Quid-
ditch team. Members practice every weekend
on the Cathedral Lawn and often have scrim-
mages on Sundays. Go watch one. You won’t
be disappointed.

Brag to all your friends that you won’t
have homework next semester while se-

Am I the only~December grad who does this?

Anyway, what I’m trying to say is, you only
have a few more weeks until you’re brutally
thrown out into the real world in the dead of
winter to suffer until you ﬁnd a job. Live out
your bucket list. You have nothing to lose any-
more — just don’t get kicked out of school.
However, I’ve already done everything on this
bucket list, so the real challenge is —— December

the federal government to make some serious
moves on the date of Thanksgiving.

But considering the reality of the traditions
— or whatever the anti-moving—Thanksgiving

we all need to make is to realize that there is a
need to check our syllabi. I know that we all
like to keep those as far away as possible after
the ﬁrst week of classes, but it’s important to
plan ahead. , - V » _ .

After collapsing in the fog ’ quarter
at Notre Dame last weelg; allowing
the Fighting Irish to storm back

from 14 points down and steal a A

victory _in triple overtime, the Pitt
football team continued its collapse
into the ﬁrst half of the;?fPanthers’
game Friday night at Connecticut.
The Huskies’ anemic offense
suddenly became explosive against
Pitt, scoring 24 points and tallying
almost 300 yards before halftime as
Connecticut (4-6, 1-4 Big East) held
on to defeat the Panthers (4-6, 1-4
Big East) at Rentschler Field, 24-17.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt collapses in one second half, rallies

Dave Uhrrnacher

Sophomore forward Cora McMa-
nus and junior forward Asia Logan
each delivered strong individual
performances during the Pitt
women’s basketball team’s first
two games of the season.

But the Panthers could only
translate one of those efforts into
a victory as they split a pair of

_ weekend home games to begin the

season in what was a disappoint-
ing start for a Pitt team expecting
to be much improved this season.

Youngstown State 64, Pitt 50

The Youngstown State Pen-
guins marched out of Pittsburgh
victorious for the second time in
three months.

After the football team stunned
Pitt in the home opener at Heinz
Field back in September, another
group of Penguins (1-0) repeated
the feat and upset the Pitt women’s
basketball team 64-50 in its sea-
son opener Friday at the Petersen
Events Center.

After the game, Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato — now in her 10th
season leading the Panthers —
said that because her team has no
seniors for a second consecutive
season, one of the Panthers-must
step up and become a leader if the
team hopes to come out of this sea-
son ahead of last year’s 16-game
losing streak.

“We are extremely disappoint-
ed,” Berenato said. “Someone
needs to grow up really quickly
and take control of this team.”

A raucous crowd of about
4,000 elementary and middle

school students from the Pitts-
burgh Public Schools ﬁlled the Pete
for the fourth-annual School Day,
but the noisy atmosphere dissi-
pated in the second half as the Pan-
thers (0-1) collapsed. Pitt opened
up a 12-point lead at halftime,
led by McManus’ eight points,
ﬁve rebounds and one block. The
players who began, the game on
the bench nearly outscored the
starters in the ﬁrst half, recording
16 points to the starters’ 17. The
Panthers’ low—post game proved
effective again, allowing Pitt to
score 14 points in the paint dur-
ing the ﬁrst half. The two teams’
combined turnovers amounted to
23 in the ﬁrst half alone, but that
trend only continued for one team
in the second half as Pitt commit-
ted 10 turnovers to Youngstown
State’s four, allowing the Penguins
to dominate the game’s ﬁnal 20

in another to

minutes.

Amidst the sloppy play on both
sides, the Penguins’ plan to hoist
3-point shots on almost every pos-
session changed the game in the
second half.

After shooting an abysmal
4—for-18, or 22 percent, from be-
yond the arc in the ﬁrst half, the
Penguins came out ﬁring again
after the break, converting 8-for-
15, or 53 percent, second-half at-
tempts from 3-point range.

Thanks to the timely 3-point
shot, Youngstown State chipped
away at the deﬁcit and eventually
took the lead with less than seven
minutes remaining in the game.
The Panthers never reclaimed that
lead, and the Penguins outscored
them 43-17 in the second half.

McManus was the lone bright
spot for Pitt, ﬁnishing with a ca-
reer-high of 16 points and seven

split games
rebounds in just 18 minutes of
playing time.

“I thought I did well with my
rebounding,” McManus said. “You
just can’t give up on any play, and
I made sure of that today.”

Berenato enjoyed the sopho-
more forward’s performance off
the bench.

“Cora was excellent today,”
Berenato said. “She became the
anchor. She stayed within her
game and did a really nice job.”

Despite McManus’ consistent-
ly strong play in the second half,
the rest of the Pitt offense disap-
peared, allowing the" Penguins to
go on a 15-0 second-half run that
proved fatal for the Panthers. A
combination of turnovers and
poor shot selection led to a pe-
riod of about nine minutes during

them in transition,” he said. “As far as the
offensive end, having two point guards out
there — myself andjames [Robinson] —
we wanted to make sure we get out and
run, make sure we make smart decisions
and make sure we get guys shots.”

And as far as getting easy baskets goes,
Pitt accomplished just that Friday. Of the
Panthers’ 80 total points in the contest,
58 of those came from inside the painted
area. Zanna was the primary beneﬁciary
of this success, as Woodall found him
multiple times for easy dunks and layups.

“We were moving the ball around well,”
Woodall said. “We didn’t want to settle for
threes. We wanted to make sure we got
inside. We have big guys who can ﬁnish,
and we have guards who can attack and
get to the basket.”

Complementing the efforts of Woodall
and the rest of the starting unit was a
strong performance by the Pitt bench,
which combined efforts to post 32 points.
Junior Trey Zeigler —— a transfer from
Central Michigan making his debut for
the Panthers — led the bench’s efforts
with 11 points.

Zanna, Woodall and Zeigler were the
only Panthers to score in double digits,
which attests to Pitt’s balanced scoring
attack.

Also off the bench, junior forward J.].
Moore ﬁnished with nine points, redshirt
sophomore guard Cameron Wright added
eight, and senior forward Dante Taylor
contributed four points and two rebounds.

With nine Panthers receiving signifi-

cant playing time, Dixon highlighted his
team’s depth as one of Pitt’s strongest
features. '

' “We’ve got a good rotation. I think any-
one can lead us in scoring at any time,”
Dixon said.

Early in the game, the Mountaineers
came out ﬁring, hitting six of their first
eight attempts from 3-point range and
taking an 18-17 lead with 11:53 remaining
in the first half.

First—year Mount St. Mary’s head coach
Jamion Christian —— the creator of the
team’s “40 minutes of mayhem” philoso-
phy — said he was happy with how his
team started the game.

“I was really pleased with how our guys
played the first 11 minutes of the game. I
think that was a small microcosm of what
you’re going to see for the duration of the
year,” Christian said.

But the Panthers quickly regained the
lead and held the Mountaineers to only
1—for—13 shooting the rest of the first half
and most importantly, 0-for-7 from be-
hind the arc. The defensive improvement
helped Pitt carry a 42-25 lead into the
break. ’

Pitt extended the lead in the second
half, holding the Mountaineers scoreless
for the first five minutes as the Panthers
steadily increased their advantage.

The Panthers will return to the floor
in the opening game of the NIT Season
Tipoff Tournament Monday at 6 p.m.
when they host Fordham at the Petersen
Events Center. I
