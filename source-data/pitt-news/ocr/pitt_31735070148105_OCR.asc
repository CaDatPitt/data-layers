Freshman 15: Fact or Fiction?

Keith Gillogly
For the Pitt News

For some, the prospect of gain-
ing the rumored freshman 15
is one of the more frightening
aspects of entering college, but
Pitt nutritionists say these extra

pounds can be avoided by devel-

oping healthy eating habits early
on and exercising regularly.

“Weight gain in the ﬁrst year
is not ‘inevitable and typically
it’s not as large as 15 pounds,”
said Diane Helsel, an assistant
professor in the School of Health
and Rehabilitation Sciences.

She said that actual weight
gain for ﬁrst—year college stu-
dents is closer to 5 pounds, ac-
cording to a study published in
thejournal of American College
Health in 2009.

Although weight gain might
not reach double-digits during
the ﬁrst year of college, Meg
Mayer—Costa, a dietitian with
Pitt’s Student Health Service,
said in an email that weight in-
creases can continue after fresh-
man year.

Students often gain some
weight as freshmen, but con-
tinue to put onaround 5 pounds
each year, she said.

Helsel cites unhealthy eating

habits as one culprit contribut-
ing to the purported freshman
15.

“It’s not so much about the
time that you eat,” Helsel said.

“It comes down to the calories _

you consume.” j
College students are infa-
mous for unhealthy diets, but
Helsel recommended trying to’
ﬁll up on healthy foods so that
there’s not as much room for less

Diane Helsel:

sources —— can be more ﬁlling
because of their higher ﬁber
content. Whole grains — such
as whole grain breads, cereals,
pastas and brown rice —- and
vegetables are also healthy car-

healthy foods.

“Take an approach where you
think about the things you want
to include in your diet, as op-
posed to things you want to stay
away from,” she said. .

Instead of avoiding unhealthy
items, Helsel recommends focus-
ing on “good—for-you foods.”

Some students believe carbo-
hydrates can lead to quick weight
gain, but Helsel said fruits —

Philip Bombara
Staff Writer

One day seven years ago when no n-
traditional student Marsha Robbins
took classes at Pitt, she overheard
her peers discussing their longings

- for left-at—home furry friends not

permitted in dorms. j

“I heard students talking about
how they missed their pets, and I
remember my kids saying the same
thing,” Robbins said.

To quell the pet craving felt by
many students and to take their

minds off studying for an hour, Rob-

bins began bringing her Therapy

Buffalo website, Karen Allen, an
assistant professor of medicine at
the University at Buffalo, found that
cardiovascular measures, such as
heart rate and blood pressure re-
mained signiﬁcantly more stable
during stressful situations for those
participants in her study that were
given a dog or a cat, as compared to
those in the non—pet owner group.
Allen found that a pet can exert
a calming inﬂuence on heart rate
when a‘ person is doing standard
tasks that are designed to cause
mental and physical stress. 4
Sharon Young from Pitt’s Coun-
seling Center echoed the blood-

Her initial desire to help stu-
dents turned into a Pitt tradition
— Therapy Dog Tuesday has been
held weekly for six years in the Ca-

thedral Commons Room from 7p.m.

to 8 p.m. The dogs will once again be
present on campus starting the sec-
ond Tuesday of the fall semester.

Sophomore Carly Cottone, who
enjoys the weekly therapy dog ses-
sions, said that when she goes to
the Cathedral, she’s reminded of
her pets at home.

“It’s a nice little break,” Cottone V

said. “It makes me think of the dog I
used to have. I really like-it.”

Robbins, acertiﬁed teacher and
senior obedience instructor at the
Western Pennsylvania Humane So-
ciety, said that petting a dog could
help alleviate stress.

that interaction between humans

and dogs can be beneﬁcial in a_

Withanhour to go beforehis macro-
economics ﬁnal exam, Pitt student
Cooper Obenreder smoked one last
cigarette on the porch of David Law-
rence Hall before he would take the
last test of his freshman year.

He had been studying for three
days straight, waking up early and
“going all day.” He estimated that

he studied for 15 hours daily, aiming;
to preserve a B when he ﬁnally took A

of his grade.

University provides

career assistance

Emily Riley
Staﬂ_"Wri ter

When students graduate from
Pitt, they often get more than just
a degree. The University offers a
slew of career assistance to ensure
that ambitious students also have_
plenty of access to job experience
and internship opportunities.

Pitt’s Career Development of-
ﬁce, located on the second ﬂoor
of the William Pitt Union, provides
students with the tools necessary
both to choose their majors and to
land their dream jobs.

The ofﬁce’s services, opened
to all undergraduates, graduate
students and alumni, offers walk-in
visits or scheduled appointments
with trained career consultants.

The 11 career consultants offer

help for career services such as

interviewing skills, resume devel- ,

opment, and mock interviews.
Its website ‘provides informa-
tion for students looking to ex-
plore different career options.
While the Career Development
Office focuses on helping students
conduct an interview or j ob search,

-SEPA works to connect businesses

and organizations with students
who are looking for jobs or intern-
ships.

-Nick Machi:

prepare themselves for a job or
graduate school. I

For example, the career cen-
ter recommends that freshmen
create a list of ﬁve possible ca-

reer options, begin network-

ing by speaking to profession-
als in the ﬁve possible ﬁelds and
volunteer in a ﬁeld of interest.

“Preparation is key, and the ear-
lier you begin to prepare for your
future, the better your chances
are of positioning yourself to be
the strongest possible candidate,”
Finlay said. “Students [who make
these preparations] will have more
time to explore careers, whether
through job shadowing, work—
ing part—time or through intern-
ships.” -

Nick Machi, a junior majoring
in mechanical engineering, has
been receiving assistancefrom
Career Development office since
his freshman year.

With the center’s-help, he placed
into several different internships,
including a research position at
Pitt’s Mascaro Center for Sustain-
able Innovation and later a posi-
tion at Kress Motors, LLC.

Machi said the internships
helped him obtain experience and
aided him in making vital decisions
about what he wants to do in the

Cheryl Finlay, director of Stu-
dent Employment & Placement
Assistance, said SEPA and Career
Development put speciﬁc empha-
sis on giving students a head start
in career decisions.

“One of our career consultants
is assigned to each incoming fresh-
man and visits the residence halls
on a regular basis,” Finlay said.
“We encourage incoming students
to make contact with their consul-
tant and start their Career Action
Plan.”

SEPA encourages students to
begin working on their resumés
early as part of the Career Action

Plan. The plan outlines services .

and suggests events that under-

graduates can participate in to _

future.- . —
“The services of the career of-
ﬁce have helped me build an excel-

lent resumé that can attract atten-

tion from potential employers,”
Machi said. “As well, it made my
interviewing experience a lot more
comfortable because I had prior
experience.”

Some students disagree about
the level of assistance available
through Pitt’s career services,
and they often look to outside re-
sources. .

Seth Folkenroth, a junior ma-
joring in political science and
history, said the services are not
geared enough toward jobs and
internships for undergraduates,

which brought Pitt the regular-season Big East title.

Pitt mascot a crowd favorite

Gretchen Andersen
’ Staﬁ” Writer

He’s a crowd favorite, posing for pic-
tures, tossing T-shirts and shaking
his booty on the court.

Turning 102 years, old this fall,

Pitt’s mascot Roc represents school .-

spirit. Three different students, who
remain anonymous so people see the
mascot strictly as the mascot, wear
the panther suit at sporting events
to amp up the audience.

One Pitt student assumed the
identity of Roc when the cheerlead-
ing team needed a quick back-up for

an event. The head Pitt eheerleading’

coach, Theresa Nuzzo, thought the
ﬁll—in did a great job. So for three
years now, that student — known
as Roc One —- has donned the furry
costume.

Typical tryouts involve having

the potential mascots performwhat '

they would do if they were the mas-
cot and had to get the crowd excited.
The mascot is chosen based on the
p_erformance. '

Roc the panther does not speak
when in character, but the student
who portrays Roc for most events
spoke sans—costume about his role

« as the school’s symbol.

Roc One said he grew up as a
die—hard_ Pitt fan. Besides telling
his teachers of his responsibilities,
Roc One keeps his identity secret
— an unofficial but traditional rule.
When he puts on the costume, the
Pitt studentfocuses solely on his task
of being the Panther. _

“You have to forget you have a
test next Monday or that you’re tired
and don’t want to be there or that
you’re hungry or that you’re ﬁght-
ing with your girlfriend,” Roc One

“Juggling school can be tough,”
Roc One said.

. . He said he asks his professors

to allow him to work ahead of the

. rest of the class so he.doesn’t fall

behind and can keep his course load
manageable.

Along with two other back-up
mascots, Roc One works ﬁill-time
year-round.’ Not only does he per-
form at various games, he also does
personal appearances at parties,
weddings and University events.

said. “You have to let it all go and put
yourself in another state of mind, so

Roc One, a nursing major, said
he has to make schoolwork adjust-
ments in order to keep up with his
studies.

ment, Roc One still enjoys arriving
at basketball and football games,
especially when he sees fans wait-
ing in line hours before tip—off' or
kickoff. C

Pitt only
a hint  
of What
Oakland
has for  
students

Michael Macagnone
Editor in Chief

Oakland has some highs and lows.

A hike up its hills leads to the
Petersen Events Center or on to
the Hill District neighborhoods.
Lower roads run under overpass-
es, train tracks and, eventually,
to Schenley Park or the Monon-
gahela River. V
Pitt’s campus lies in the heart
of Oakland, surrounded by the
shopping and cultural strips of
Craig Street and Centre Avenue
with the more than—50o-foot-
tall, Gothic—styled Cathedral of
Learning serving as a landmark
for anyone heading to campus.
Many think that Oakland is
one giant neighborhood — or else
divided into two, North and South
Oakland. But Oakland is actually
comprised of four neighbor-
hoods: North, West, Central and
South —— no East — and the four
extend from North Craig Street
and Centre Avenue in the north
to Schenley Park and the Monon-
gahela River in the south.

Here’salookintothefour divisions:
North Oakland

Pitt students’ academic lives
revolve around North Oakland.

Head outbound on a short bus ride

land awaits in Shadyside.»

“The maindraw for me about
Shadyside is that alot of the restau-
rants and shops are independent,”
said Sarah Kochin, a new Pitt alum-
na. “They have unique products
and a unique atmosphere you can’t
really ﬁnd on campus.” '

Kochin graduated from Pitt in
May and is contemplating a move .
to Shadyside. She said one of her
favorite spots to shop is the Kards
Unlimited novelty store, which
stands .between the __Coffee Tree
and the -Pottery Barn‘-_o'n‘Walnut‘
Street. . ’

Inside the store, the walls are
lined from ﬂoor to ceiling, with
Benjamin Franklin action ﬁgures,
hand-crafted jewelry and Shake-
sp_eare T—shirts with sayings like,

some consider to be the Shadyside
credo: “Ten thousand rich people

“The neighborhood is certainly
affluent,” Kochin said, “You can’t
really do much if you don’t have
cash to spend, especially at night.
The bars and restaurants can get

pretty pricey.”

Outside Kards Unlimited, the

' neighborhood is quaint, with an

almost European feel. Pedestrians
swarm the narrow blocks, carrying
cups of coffee and walking well-
groomed dogs along the rows of
upscale boutiques.

Away from Walnut Street, the
houses are mainly brick —— some
with Victorian parapets. Unlike
much of Oakland’s housing, many
residencies stand alone, with well-
deﬁned yards and spacious side-
walks. A number of Pitt students
live in Shadyside, as does Pitt Chan-
cellor Mark Nordenberg.

Jewish heritage runs strong insquirrel Hill

Neighborhood known for residential areas and shopping

S Andrew Shull —

Staff Writer

Bus: Any 61

A handful of neighborhoods with
distinct cultures, ethnicities and
histories make up the city of Pitts-
burgh, and in Squirrel Hill, one
doesn’t have to look very hard to
ﬁnd evidence of the neighborhood’s
Jewish heritage.

There are at least seven syna-
gogues in Squirrel Hill and a num-
ber of kosher grocery stores, includ-
ing Murray Avenue Kosher located
on the street of the same name, a
main thoroughfare through Squir-
rel Hill lined with restaurants, bars
and other stores.

Squirrel Hill is situated just to
the east of Oakland, with Schen-
ley Park and Carnegie Mellon in
between the two neighborhoods.
Shadyside and Point Breeze bor—'
der Squirrel Hill to the north, and
Greenﬁeld and Hazelwood abut the
neighborhood to the south.

With its close proximity to Oak-
land, Squirrel Hill is easy to get to
by taking any 61 Port Authority bus
on Forbes Avenue. The bus ride is
a quick ﬁve to 10 minutes, and the
area serves as a popular place for
Pitt students to live off-campus, es-
pecially since it tends to be quieter
than most of Oakland.

While most of Squirrel Hill is
residential, Forbes and Murray ave-
nues are probably the two streets of
most interest to Pitt students look-
ing to get out of Oakland. The two
roads contain a collection of eclectic
shops and restaurants not available
in students’ native Oakland.

One of the shops on Forbes,
one block‘ past Murray, is a vin-
tage clothing store and consign-
ment shop called Avalon Exchange.
Avalon Exchange is a thrift store
that sells used clothes and features
brands from Forever 21 to Gucci and
Prada at a steep discount.

Owner Steve McLean described
it as a “fun” place to shop.

“There’s a constant ﬂow of mer-
chandise,” McLean said. “Hundreds
and hundreds of new merchandise,
and it’s priced to sell. It’s kind of like
a trader’s hunt.”

If looking to sell back clothes,
Avalon Exchange generally offers its
sellers 30 percent of the retail price
of clothing in cash or 45 percent
of the original retail price if they

South Side not just known forbars

Southside Works offers shopping, movies and food

Emily Riley
Staﬁ Writer

Bus: 75 or 54C on Fifth out of
Oakland

It’s Saturday night, and East Car-
son Street is lit up with glowing
nightclubs. The music flows out
from the front doors, people
shout, and the honking of car
horns makes it almost impos-

‘sible to hear a person standing

5 feet away.

Located less than a mile from
the heart of Oakland, the South
Side offers an atmosphere differ-
ent to that of the typical outdoor
mall of popular clothing stores,
restaurants and Friday or-Satur-
day night house parties.

Even though the South Side
takes up plenty of attention for
its bars, other attractions such as
retail stores, eateries and enter-
tainment venues are also plenti-
ful in the riverside neighborhood.
With a mix of localiand national
retailers, the South Side’s shop-

v.

ping center Southside Works
and other scattered storefronts
satisfy students’ fashionable

sides. Among the stores in the '

area are BCBGMaxAzria, Jupe
Boutique, Forever 21 and Steve
Madden Ltd. .
Food options are plentiful,
with restaurants that serve pub
food as well as Asian, Mediter-
ranean, Italian,'Greek, German
and_Latin American cuisine.
Sophomore Rebecca Varney

prefers the sushi in the South.

Side to what she can find in Oak-
land.

“There are a bunch of great
restaurants,” Varney said. “Tus-
ca and Nakama definitely have
the best sushi.”

Another popular restaurant
is Hofbrauhaus on South Water
Street. The brewpub, modeled
after the more than-4oo—year-
old Hofbrauhaus in Munich,
Germany, is known for its wide
array of microbrews.

Junior Evan Terwilliger said
the restaurants are the best part
of the South Side.

“I love the Double Wide
Grill,” Terwilliger said. “And of
course you can’t talk about the
South Side without mentioning

the Cheesecake Factory. But If

only eat there when my parents
pay.” ~ .

A more casual dining loca-
tion located on Carson Street,
the Double Wide Grill is a vintage

' gas station-turned-restaurant

that features barbecue and even
vegan options. ‘

Double Wide Grill marketing
coordinator Ashley Ryon said

students typically come to the‘

South Side to escape the crazi-
ness of Oakland on weekend
nights.

“There is an older, more ma-

ture crowd here. You feel kinda
bad being loud and drunk here,”
Ryon said.

The South Side is a neighbor-
hood that has two personalities.
During the day, it’s laid back and

Students ﬁnd green

Bike and running trails popular _ —

;

Whenthe sun comes out and the
weather begins to get warmer,
students ﬂock to one of the large

stretches of green space in Oak'-
‘ land. - ‘

Schenley Park covers more
than 420 acres of land and serves
as a boundary between the neigh-
borhoods of Oakland, Squirrel Hill
and Greenﬁeld. - '

Numerous bike and running
trails run through the park, and
otherfeatures include soccer ﬁelds,
a track and the Bob O’Connor golf
course, the only golf course within
walking distance of campus.

Recent Pitt graduates Leah Wil-
liams and Sarah Gayman, along‘

with many other Pittsburgh resi— ~
dents, frequently run in the park “
‘when the weather is nice.

“We usually take the trail that
goes down the steps and around

the pond,” Gayman said.

The pond Gayman referred to is
Panther Hollow Lake, dug in 1909
for recreational use. Since then,
the lake has shrunk to one-third of
its original size, and ‘Fits ecological

‘condition is poor,” according to

the park website.

Gayman and Williams both
warn against getting too close to
the lake.

“I’m a little afraid of falling

. in,” Williams said. “It looks a little

dirty.» ‘ » ,

Williams’ fears aren’t entirely}

misplaced, as junior Michael Mat-
ula can attest.

, On a chilly day last March,

with some friends. Noting that a
thin layer of ice coated the pond’s
surface, Matula grabbed a stick
and prodded at the ice trying to
break it apart. At one point he

Josh Finkenbinder spent much of the
first two decades ofhis life in a small
town near Carlisle, Pa., “where the
deﬁnition of ﬁin was cow tipping and
off-road racing.”

Finkenbinder moved to Pittsburgh
in20o8 to study cinema at Point Park
University in Downtown, Pittsburgh.
Now, two years into his college expe-
rience, he says living Downtown has
been a reﬁning experience, especially
when compared to his small—town up-

to Oakland aftertwo years inPointPark
dormitories, living Downtown was a
vital part of his education.

“I comefromanareadominatedby

from a place that is predominantly
white and predominately Christian.
Living in the city is totally different

There are so many different types of A

people interactingallthe time, so many

Nick Hewitt,-another Point Park
senior, shared Finkenbinder’s opin-

community east of Pittsburgh called
Monroeville. The allure of Downtown
Pittsburglfs urban atmosphere was a

signiﬁcant factor in his decision to at-
tend PointPark.

“Ilikethatyou canstep out ofyour
door and do something,” Hewitt said.
“When I visit my mom back in the

There’s more energy Downtown.”

known for its entertainment.

AMC Loews movie theater and
Dave & Buster’s Restaurant, Bar-
and Arcade as well as Pittsburgh’s
Improv Comedy Club are all lo-
cated at the Waterfront.

Improv offers open—mic ses-
sions open to anyone 18 years or
older every other Wednesday of
the month. For those who want
to see how the pros — such as
recent guests Jay Mohr and Theo
Von — tickle the funnybone, Im-

on Thursday and Sunday nights
which cost between $15-30. The
other nights of the week, the
club is open to people 21 years

“We always encourage the col-

form,” said Matt McDermit, the
man behind the sound equipment
at Improv.

The responsibility of allocating

the more than $2-million of the

student activities fund rests in the
hands of one student organiza-
tion — the Student Government
Board.

Eight undergraduate Board
members and one president,
elected by their peers, hold the

power to distribute the fund and.

promote the interests of all of
Pitt’s'undergraduate, non— College
of General Studies students.

The Board holds weekly pub-

lic meetings on Tuesday nights -

in Nordy’s Place, during which it
votes on allocations requests from
various student organizations.

Allocating. the funds isn’t al-
ways easy, especially because
the $80 Student Activities Fee
charged to all non-CGS under-
graduate students each semester
has not increased in eight years,
while the number of certiﬁed stu-
dent organizations only continues
to grow.

SGB President Molly Stieber
has said it would be unlikely for

a any organization to see an in-

crease in funding from previous
years.

Around half of the $2.3 million
is reserved for formula groups
like WPTS, Pitt’s radio station;
Pitt Program Council, and Pan-
ther Prints, Pitt’s yearbook. This
leaves only aroundi$1 million of ‘
funding to be dispersed among
the more than 400 non—formula

Panther Card  
serves various
purposes

Andrew Shull
Stajf Writer

Sophomore Aurora Obembe car-
ries her Panther Card with her
everywhere she goes, like many
students.

“It’s kind of your life here,”
she said. “It has money on it. It

has your meal plan on it. It’s an '

important card.”

From providing room access
and serving as transportation
passes to buying food and doing
laundry, the Pitt ID is one of the
most versatile cards students will
carry in their wallets.

Panther Cards perform a
number of functions on and off
campus. Every time students
enter their dorm buildings, the
security guard on duty will swipe
their cards. When students get

to their room, their ID card will ‘
work like a hotel key, except for

the added‘ security measure of
punching in a four digit code af-

ter using the card.

The ID card can also get stu-
dents into the fitness centers
and other sports facilities on
campus.

The Panther Card grants stu-
dents access to transportation
around Pittsburgh as well. The
ID card provides students with
unlimited rides on the bus, in-
cline, train, rail and trolley ser-
vices provided by the Pittsburgh
Port Authority, the city’s public
transportation service. The price
for transportation is included in
the $90-per—semester fee that
each student pays separate from
tuition. 4'

Study abroad helpsenrich  

students’ college experiences

‘Shae Felicien

Staff Writer

Students don’t have to wait until they
graduate towalkalong the Great Wall
of China orwander inside the ancient
halls of the Colosseum;

Pitt’s Study Abroad Office, located
on the eighth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union, helps studentsﬁnd a study
abroad program to enrich their col-
lege experience. .

Jeff Whitehead, director of the

’ Study Abroad Ofﬁce, said the ben-

eﬁts of studying in another country

include encounteringforeigncultures,

the potential fortremendous personal

growth and studying in a different
educational system.

Even considering all of these ben-
eﬁts, only a small percentage of stu-
dents study abroad, Whitehead said.

“The national average for partici-
pation in study abroad is less than 1
percent of all undergraduates,” he

said. “Pitt has a higher average, send- I

ing between 3 percent and4 percent of

its undergraduates a1mually.’.’
Whitehead noted that students
typically study abroad between the
second semester of their sophomore
year and the ﬁrst semester of their
senior year. -
Colleen Moroney, a senior phar-

. macystudent, was one ofthe minority

who chose to study abroad.
Moroney spent the last spring se-
mesteraspa1tofPittMulti-regionAca-
dernic Program. She spent 15 weeks
studying in Buenos Aires,tArgentina;

Cape Town, SouthAfrica, and Beijing, V

China, with 21 other students.
“Everyone comes homefrom study

' abroadsaying,‘Itwasthebestexperi-

ence of my life,’ and I expected it to
change me, but it’s hard to put into
words just how big of a difference it

, makes,”Moroneysaid.“Itcompletely

surpassed my expectations, and all I
cansayisthatfmsogladlhadthe op-
portunity to see so much of the world.

It was beyond amazing. It sounds so .

cliché, but it really was an incredible,
eye—opening, life-changing experi-
ence.”

4 Moroney saidthat although study

. abroadmightseemimpossiblebecause

of the intensive planning required, all
a student needs to do is focus.

“If you plan ahead and put in the ,

effort it takes to ﬁnd the right pro-
gram, apply and prepare to leave, next
thing you know you’re on the most
amazing adventure ofyour life so far,”
Moroney said.

. Because many study abroad pro-
grams can be more expensive than
a semester at Pitt, students can look
into state, federal and campus-based
ﬁnancial aid and scholarships to cut
back on costs. B

Comedy entertainment offered at Friday Nite mprovs

  

Students perform at one of the Friday Night Improvs in April. The show — which takes place in the basement of the Cathedral— is» open

A Emily Marmion
Staff Writer

On a Friday night in the basement
of the Cathedral of Learning, Pitt
students acted out a pelican, a
ﬁsh, a talking cat and the poten-
tial aftermath of mugging Mike
Tyson.

These scenes were part of a
game called “Freeze,” which is
performed at the weekly Friday
Nite Improvs.

Every Friday night during the
school year at 11 p.m., Pitt stu-
dents and others from around
Pittsburgh head to the Studio
Theater in the Cathedral base-
ment for the Friday Nite Improvs,
Pittsburgh’s only all-audience par-
ticipation improvisation comedy
show. The show gives students
an entertaining night; one of the
many programs on Pitt’s campus
that does so. .

“Freeze” involves two or three
performers on stage acting out a
scene. An audience member yells
“Freeze!” at some point during
the scene, and then the volunteer
taps one of the on-stage perform-
er’s shoulders and takes his or her
place, assuming the same position
the last performer was in. The new
performer must start a new scene
with the other performer already

on stage based on the positions
they are in.
Ben Mayer, a Pitt alumnus, the

current host of FNI and the man-

aging director ofthe ‘show’, is the
only set performer of the night.
Anyone that attends the impro-
visation show is welcomed and
encouraged to participate.

“If you don’t, there really won’t
be a show,” Mayer said during one

Friday N ite Improv.

Admission is $3, which cov-
ers the rent and insurance for the
comedy show. The rest goes to
various local and national chari-
ties.

“Any money we take in above
and beyond the cost of our rent
and insurance goes to a charity,
which we decide on at the end of
the year,” Mayer said.

Mayer said the show —— which
is not aiﬁliated with Pitt — doesn’t
require any sort of funding from
the University.

“No one gets paid, and because
the show doesn’t require anything
other than a place to perform,
there are really no expenses to
cover other than rent and insur-
ance,” he said.

FNI began when several theater
graduate students launched an
improv workshop in 1989 called
“Late N ite Club.” The workshop
expanded into casual evenings of

comedy every Friday night.
Two decades later, FNI has be-
come the longest-running comedy

,_s_how__in P,i,ttsbu_rgh,Mayer_said. _....

The core of the comedy show is
based on improvisation. Amateur
and experienced actors who don’t
normally work together perform
short skits.

“Improvisation is both an ex-
ercise for actors and an art form
in and of itself,” Mayer said in
an email. “In both cases, it in-
volves doing scene work with no
script.”

It’s the on-the-spot aspect that

can make improv beneﬁcial for '

developing skills for jobs.

Martel Manning graduated
from the theatre arts program at
Pitt this past spring. While at Pitt,
he took many theater. classes —
some speciﬁcally focused on im-
prov — and participated in Friday
Nite Improvs as well.

“Improv can be used to stimu-

.late the creative mind and grants
conﬁdence,” Manning said. “This
can help people who are writers
working on pieceslor someone
who has to do a lot of public
speaking.” '

Having improv knowledge also
helps during interviews, Manning
said. —

“It makes you more accessible
and conﬁdent when talking to the

interviewer and lets you become

aware of both of your needs,” he i

said.

,1, ,, An interview -reﬂects -the give

and take of two actors during an
improv scene. ,

“You need a job, and your
interviewer needs someone to
ﬁll a position,” Manning said.
But non—theater majors shouldn’t
feel intimidated. _

“While we certainly encourage
experienced performers to attend
and. participate, our real goal is
to get people who never thought
of themselves as ‘performers’ or
‘actors’ to get on stage and try
to do some funny scenes,” Mayer
said.

And to make people feel com-
fortable with doing ridiculous
acts, he tells the audience the
ﬁrst rule of the improv show is
that “failure is OK.”

The other ﬁve rules that Mayer
outlines at the beginning of each
show include welcoming each vol-
unteer with applause, no booing,
the audience must listen intently,
people must clean up after them-
selves and having fun is a must.

While most students go to FNI
just to watch, Pitt senior LaLa

Yuan loves to participate as much A

as possible.
“I’m kind of an attention
whore,” Yuan said. “I like being

on stage.”
FNI has dozens of different

games, and each night includes ,
about six improvisation games.

The entire show lasts about two
hours.

During one night of games,
audience members shook their

“badonkadonks,” became bron-

tosauruses in a zoo on another
planet and acted out Little Red
Riding Hood with a post-apoca-
lyptic twist. .

Yuan used her hands and imag-
ination to mimic a printer ejecting
paper as her partner tried to guess
what she was miming —‘it was
homophobic printers.

This scene was part of the
game called “Pledge Break.” Two
performers “interrupt a program
on a public broadcast station” to
sell an object. However, these
two performers do not know

. what object they’re selling. As-

signed partners mime to them an
adj ective—noun combination, such
as “homophobic printer,” trying
to get the performers to say the
two words.

Yuan has been attending FNI
for three years. She enjoys go-

. ing because it gets her out of the

house on a Friday night.

“I don’t have a life,’’ Yuan said.
“I would just be playing video
games.” I ’

fore, he wasn’t-aware that the center
offered the same tutoring for eco-
nomics, a resource he said he deﬁ-
nitely would have used.

Though it might seem like the all-
night paper-writing or study session
is a time-honored college tradition,
the University provides numerous
academic services to help students
avoid the stress, aggravation and
sleep-deprivation that procrastina-
tion brings.

The Writing€enter and Academic
Resource Center offer academic as-
sistance services the University of-
fers free to students.

“You’re already paying for it,”
said Mike Chirdon-Jones, Resource

Center tutor coordinator. “You might _

as well use it.”

The ARC, located in the Gard-
ner Steel Conference Center off
Thackeray Street, runs group and
one-on-one tutoring programs for
students.

Chirdon-Jones said tutors fo-
cus on speciﬁc classes, including
biology, chemistry, economics,
statistics and physics, as well as
general information for target-

ing the strengths and weaknesses
of an individual’s study habits.

before their exam to make an ap-
pointment, as spots ﬁll up quickly
especially for their most popular
subjects: physics, chemistry and
biology.

Suraj Lakshminarasimhan, a

that he has used the ARC 11 times,

for Biology II, over the course of the

help from undergraduates and fac-
ulty members for students across all
disciplines, majors and skill levels.

“We can also help and support
people who have had a lot of success
in their writing — people who con-
sider themselves writers,” she said.

Grace said that the Writing Cen-
ter takes a much different approach
than aprofessor does when he hands
back a paper. _

Writing Center tutors will notice
and highlight certain patterns in stu-
dents’ writing that need to be cor-
rected and explain how and why the

writer should ﬁx the problems.
“A professorwill tell you that you
have problems with comma splices,
_without telling you what a comma
‘splice is,” Grace said.
Cassandra Gallaschun, a senior

majoring in chemical engineering, ”

said that she used the Writing Center
for a large engineering paper. The
twist was that the paper would be
graded by English professors.
“They encouraged us to go to the
Writing Center for that paper,” she

' said, because the quality of writing

would be taken into consideration.
Gallaschun said she went to the
center two or three times over the
course of the year, which made her
project more manageable.
_ Students canset up appointments

. for the Writing Center online.

H Chirdon-Jones and Grace said
that the students who work at the,
Writing Center and the ARC go
through a training process in order
to prepare them to assist students.

" Grace said that tutors at the Writ-
ing Center take a semester-long class
inthe fall that instructs them inboth

teaching theory and the practical .ap- ‘

plication of that theory. In the spring,

Academic Resource Center, Writing Center help students

the prospective interns work closely
with a faculty member so they can
apply what they have learned and
get real experience with the students.

There are about thirty paid interns ’ I

each semester. _

The highly skilled interns also
exist at the ARC, because they are
qualiﬁed and have received training
on how to teach certain subjects.

“Not just any old person can be a
tutor,” Chirdon—]ones said.

He said that prospective tutors
for the ARC must have achieved a

’ B— or better in the class they wish

to teach, have at least a 3.0 overall
GPA and letters of recommenda-
tion. The ARC then selects the most
qualiﬁed students from the pool of
applicants. ,

Before students ﬁnd themselves
on their ﬁfth energy drink as they
shift through a pile of papers scat-
tered across, a desk in Hillman Li_-
brary, both other students and the
resource centers recommend plan-
ningahead and seeking out the nec-
essary help. ' _

including “accepting a friendly

and “reacting to children.”

Dynamic Dogs, taught by Rob-

‘ bins, is speciﬁcally geared to ca-
_ nine presence in the Cathedral, be-

cause dogs must be able to handle
the extremely high ceilings, which
produce bothersome echoes.
“[The Cathedral] has the potential
to really freak out an untrained
dog,” Robbins said.

Aside from the tests, Robbins
also personally approves the 11 or
more dogs at the Cathedral each
Tuesday. Sprinkles, a 3-year-old
greyhound, is one of the canine
visitors.

Cara Rickard adopted Sprinkles
from the Humane Society and raced
him for two and a half years before
he retired and became atherapy dog.

“They only keep racing them
if they are winning,” Rickard said.
It was Sprinkles’ temperament
that made Rickard realize that he
could be a therapy dog. She said
she couldn’t keep Sprinkles just to
herself.

“It didn’t take long for [my fam-
ily and I] to realize how wonderful

and loving a dog he is, and I felt like '

it would be a shame not to share him
with people,” Rickard said.

Another motivating factor in
Rickard’s decision to train Sprinkles
as a therapy dog was the positive
effect she saw through the therapy
dogs that visited her grandfather
before he passed away.

‘ “There were dogs that came in A

to see him two times a week, and
he was a big animal person,” she

said. “Seeing the way that it re--

ally turned his whole day around
and how happy it made him, that
deﬁnitely helped the decision in a
large way.”

Marla Rhem, who graduated”

in May, said she used to try to go
to the Cathedral of Learning every
Tuesday to visit the dogs.

“I can’t own my own dogbecause
I am too busy, so I always make sure
I ‘am in the Cathedral on Tuesday
nights,” she said. “It is nice to play
with them, and it really does help
you forget about your stress for a
little bit.” ’,-{:;

Greeks ‘take part in many traditions and ceremonies

Greek< 28

In addition to learning the histo-
ry of their fraternities and sororities,
members can take part in numerous
traditions and ceremonies.

The Greeks hold a variety of
charitable events throughout the
year. Some of those include Greek
Sing and the Pitt Dance Marathon,
which raise money for the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

In order to carry out many of
their activities, fraternities and
sororities require that each mem—

‘ ber pay dues each semester. The

amounts vary depending on the
chapter, but many require hundreds
of dollars. Hasley does not think
that the ﬁnancial obligation should
discourage a person from pursuing
the chance to join a chapter.
“[Dues] go toward the fraterni-
ties’ expenses, such as recruitment,
house projects, chapter retreats and

- many other things,” Hasley said. “By

paying dues, though, each brother is
an active member in a tight brother-
hood. Pitt fraternities derive their
strength from these bonds of broth-
erhood, and it is by these bonds
that chapters are able to function

-on campus.” E

Career Development hosts various career fairs

so he tried a different resource.

“The material on the Career Services
website seems more geared toward help-
ing graduate students and alumni ﬁnd jobs,
not undergraduates,” Folkenroth said. “Fu—
tureLinks was helpful, but I ultimately found
an internship through the Institute of Poli-
tics, not Career Services.”

While Folkenroth had to look to other Pitt
services, Machi found the assistance from
the Career Development ofﬁce extremely
helpful.

“I would absolutely recommend Career
Services to other students,” he said.

Machi also made use of Pitt’s FutureLinks,
a website accessible through my.pitt.edu, to

make himself more available to potential.

employers.

' “A lot of companies look to their web-
sites for job applications, and I ﬁgured that
FutureLinks would be a great resource for

me to apply for internships online,” Machi‘

said.

FutureLinks allows students to create an
employment proﬁle that can be shared with
future employers. It includes the student’s
resumé, past employers with contact infor-
mation and the student’s personal career
goals.

To further assist students, Career Devel-
opment hosts several career fairs through-

out the year including the Fall Career Fair,
the Academic Rush Majors Fair and the SEPA
Summerjob Fair.

The Fall Career Fair will take place Sept. C

28 at the Petersen Events Center.

While both the Career Fair and the Aca-
demic Rush Majors Fair are mainly focused
on career opportunities, the summer job fair
focuses on helping students obtain summer
jobs or internships to make some extra cash
over the summer or build up their resume.

This past year’s fair featured representa-
tives from 49 employers and an additional
26 companies that sent in applications to be
provided for students, Finlay said.

Finlay said these companies come from
all over the country to pick from the pool of

Pitt students and graduates. The list includes.

companies such as American Eagle Outﬁt-
ters, NSA, Teach For America, Bank of New
York Mellon and PPG Industries.

Machi said the career services offered at
Pitt gave him the necessary opportunities to
pursue a successful future.‘ '

“Having a degree alone is no longer good
enough for most employers,” he said. “They
want to see candidates with an internship
or co—op experience, and the career office
is a great way to obtain those necessary ex-
periences.” [

Roc shows up to games ready for action

Roc 4 10 -

mon topic of spirited discussion, Pitt’s athletics
are no exception, and Roc One takes his job of
pumping up the crowd very seriously.

Roc One shows up to each game — four
hours before game—'time — ready for action,
with his minivan full of battle gear.

“I first drop oﬁ‘ a bunch of props for what-
ever skit I’m doing that day,” Roc One said. “I
have all kinds of stuff: a noise meter, a scooter,
abig fake cameral made and more. I drink lots
of ﬂuids before the game starts, trying to load
upon Gatorade.”

In order to preserve the Roc costume,
Nuzzo has the person wearing the costume
put on one sleeve of Under Armour and long
socks underneath to absorb the sweat.

It takes 20 minutes for Roc One to pu_t_on
the suit, with help from fellow cheerleader
Cathryn Hoel, a senior.

Roc One said he feels like it’s “115 degrees”

inside the costume, but he doesn’t notice.the

heat when the game begins. I

“When you are doing your job, then you
don’t notice anything but people, not even the
game,” Roc One said. “I’m only thinking, ‘OK,
there’s four seconds left and now there is atim—
eout. How am I going to excite the crowd?”’

In April, Roc One’s hard work and com-
mitment paid off when he placed sixth out of
16 in the mascot division for the NCA/NDA
Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship

   

in Daytona, Fla. This was the ﬁrst year Pitt
participated in the mascot division.

“He’s taken the character to a whole new
level,” Nuzzo said of Roc One. “He’s afavorite
for old and young.” ‘

Roc was mentioned in a USA Today article
in March when he had a dance—off with the
Butler Bulldog during a time—out in the NCAA
men’s basketball tournament. Although the

two mascots were chastised after the game by .

NCAA overseer forthe illegal action, the crowd
seemed to love it, according to the article.
“Roc’s dancing is really his signature,’ but his
props, crowd involvement and game— day pres-
ence really make him stand out in any envi-
ronment,” Hoel said, “Roc is an energetic fan
inside and outside of the costume.”

A senior graduating in the fall, Roc One’s
ﬁnal reign as the panther will be this fall’s_foot-
ball season. Roc One said he would never trade
his spot for one in the stands.

“Once you are a part of the actual game—day
festivities, it gives you almost a purpose for be-
ing there,” he said. “I went from being a crazy
Pitt fan to being someone who wants to make
sure the atmosphere is that much better. And
I’m sure it will be hard to sit back and watch
when I’m done here. I think an important part
for whomever to take over is to be extremely
passionate about what they are doing or else
it will ‘show through the costume.” I

or equipment is important to the group.
11.-Don’t be afraid of the SGB office on the
eighth ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union. The
Board is always willing to meet with any
student who needs assistance with a re-
quest.

SGB also has other responsibilities,
aside from allocations. Each Board member
came into office with a list of initiatives.

Board member Alex Zimmerman said
two of the projects he ran on last fall were
brought to him by students — the graduate
exam resource center in Hillman Library
and a Student Government Leadership

Scholarship, also pursued by former Board ’

member David Gau.

Zimmerman, a senior at Pitt, said nei— ’

ther of his programs have been initiated
yet. He is still in talks with the University’s
Office of General Counsel and Office of In-
stitutional Advancement.

‘Zimmerman said the Board plays a
major advocacy role for the student body,
whether that be lobbying the University
administrators or politicians at the state
capital.

‘‘[The Board] is an important outlet
for anyone who has an idea to make Pitt a
better place,” he said. “Even if you’re not
a Board member, there is always a way to
get involved.” »

When Gov. Tom Corbett announced his

' budget cuts in early March, SGB began

protesting the cuts to Pitt’s state funding,
which included more than $900 million in
cuts to higher education. Pitt’s state appro-
priations would be reduced by 50 percent
— from $160‘ million to $80 million.

Stieber oversaw various initiatives or-
ganized to get student voices heard, which
included a l'etter-writing campaign aimed
at representatives, a photo project in which
students took a picture holding a white
board after completing the sentence, “If
you cut our funding...,” and Pitt Day in Har-
risburg, which bused students to the state
capital for a day of lobbying.

Board member Emily Hoover and her
intern, junior communication major Mad-
eline Beyer, worked on the white board
photo project. It was later compiled into a
booklet the Board handed out to legislators

' during Pitt-Day in Harrisburg.

A Qd  of the photos was
posted to various social networking sites,
including YouTube and Facebook.

Stieber said the efforts were largely a
success. After her meeting with Corbett’s
chief of staff, William Ward, she said Ward
appeared sympathetic to the cause and
said it- was likely Pitt will not see all the
proposed cuts take effect. I

The committees generate most ideas for
PPC’s events and decide which speakers
and performers to bring. Misuraca said
. there are no prerequisites or screening
processes to join a committee, so long as
members are undergraduates at Pitt. If
students who are not part of PPC would
like a particular performer or speaker to
come to Pitt, they can let PPC know.

“If people come in and say, ‘I have
this great idea,’ we’re going to take it and
bounce it off our committees,” Auger said.
“We encourage anyone to give-their opin-
ions, and the best way to do that is to get
involved”,

After a PPC event, attendees often take
surveys so that the organization can keep
track of what students did and didn’t like.
This also helps gauge interests in order to
plan future events, Auger said.

From‘ helping to plan events and work-
ing and negotiating with performers’ and
speakers’ agents, Misuraca said PPC aims
to provide real-world experience for stu-
dents.

“The student population always wants
. the bigger acts,” he said. “If the students

[who work on PPC] are learning those real-
life skills, the programs will be good.” I '

Welsh, referring to her Panther Card.
Previously, Pitt ID holders would present
their cards to bus drivers, but starting this

' summer, the Port Authority will start using

a technology that will let students tap their
IDs on recently installed fareboxes. A chip
inside the card recognizes the tap, and al~
lows the student on the bus or train.

But the usefulness of the Panther Card

Watch for information this fall

about an exciting Pitt program
that will help students develop and

  maintain a healthy lifestyle.  

 
  

     

Pitt’s HealthyU features special physical H
education classes; exercise, weight, and stress
>' management programs, and much more!  

 

Pitt ID usedfor buses, museums and food    

' doesn’t stop once students have reached

their destination. Panther Cards gives stu-
dentsaccess to a number of museums,
not just in Oakland, but around the city
as well.

As for attractions within walking dis-

tance, Pitt students can get into Phipps '

Conservatory, the Carnegie Museums of
Art and Natural History — which are
housed.in the same complex —— and S01-
diers & Sailors Memorial Hall and Mu-
seum, all for free during the school year.

Outside of Oakland, Pitt students can . ‘
get into the Heinz History Center on Penn -

Avenue, Downtown. Just across the All

legheny River on the North Shore, Pitt '

students can gain entrance to the Andy
Warhol Museum and the Mattress Fac-
tory, both of which showcase Pittsb'urgh’s
thriving cultural community.

But the Panther Card isn’t just like a
passport — it holds important ﬁnancial
information too, representatives from
Panther Central said. j

To gain access to Market Central or
the Perch at Sutherland — the two all-
you—can‘—eat cafeterias on campus — stu-

' dents will give their Panther Cards to an

employee to swipe. Each swipe subtracts

one from the total number provided by a _

student’s meal plan.

' There are two other ways to pay for
food with the Panther Card. One is Din-
ing Dollars, which can be used to pay for

. meals and snacks at a number of places - »

around campus. Dining Dollars are dif-
ferent from Panther Funds, which is .a

separate kind of moneythat can be used

on and off campus at certain stores, just

- like a debit card.

Students often use Panther Funds for
laundry on campus — instead of using
cash. Panther Funds save students an extra

25 cents on each load of laundry. The funds
can also be used at various restaurants and _

retailers near campus. A full list of shops,

whichchange occasionally, is available on

Panther Central’s website.
As a freshman, senior Caitlin Burch
found Panther Funds useful for laundry.
“It was easier than having quarters,”
she said. * ' - ' ‘
Burch said her use of Panther Funds
lessened once she moved off—campus.
“I don’t really use Panther Funds any-

more now that I live off-campu_s,” Burch .

said._“It’s just easier to use a regular debit
card.” p ’ V
 Should students lose their Panther

Card, they can report the loss to Panther A

Central. New IDs can be purchased for $20.

the Study Abroad Oflice, and materials are re-
viewed by advisers and sent directly to the spon-

Whitehead said’ he recommends students
begin planning to study abroad a'year in ad-
vance —— the ﬁrst step is to attend an Essentials
session.

“Essentials is a one—hour, one-time—on1y

: . orientation for students who are new to study

abroad,” Whitehead said. “It discusses the basics
of the study-abroad process, program selection
and_ﬁnancing study abroad.” '

The Study Abroad Office holds the sessions
multiple times a week. The times are not set yet

for the fall semester, but will be posted on the

of‘ﬁce’s website when they are. .

_To ease the mind of the fearful parent, White-
head said the office regulates health and safety

“Additionally, there is a campus committee
dedicated to monitoring and reviewing world

Apart from the myriad shops and stand-

can ﬁnd in Shadyside that you can’t ﬁnd in

_ Oakland: New York—style hot dogs.

Joe Colaneri and his wife Christine opened
a hot dog cart on Walnut Street ﬁve years ago,
serving beef franks, chicken and burgers.
Today, their cart stands in front of American
Apparel. The wheeled contraption looks like
a cross between a lawn tractor and a kitchen
stove —— and smells like delicious meat.

city officials to transform the 5-acre lot into
a green space — now known as Schenley
Plaza ——- it was difficult to keep up with new

' vending permit prices, he said. '

“The rent went through the roof,” Joe
said. “And by the time the park was ﬁnished,
they relocated everyone to Bigelbw, any-
way.”

From Oakland, the couple moved to
Shadyside, and today business is booming.

“We still get a lot of Pitt students on
Saturdays,” Chris said. “They come to shop

mostly, to grab abite to eat. There’s nothing —

better than a hot dog while they wait for the

“A lot of Pitt and CMU-kids do their par-

there are a handful of hip places to go. On the
weekends, students arrive by the busload to
eat crepes or pancakes at Pamela’s.”

V Cating spends much of her time on Wal-
nut Street. She even volunteers atJoe’s Dog

House, where she knows many of the cus-

tomers by name. _

“If I had to give advice about the neigh-

side streets,” Cating said. “There’s more than
just an Apple Store and a Banana Repub-
lic. There’s an ice cream shop that has 100

basement on Bellefonte. You can always ﬁnd

Neighborhood known for unique shops and pizza

Squirrel Hill 4 14

choose to take store credit. '

“The style is the No. 1 thing we look for
when buying back clothes, and brand and
condition — those are the three criteria
used,” McLean said.

McLean, originally from Ohio, has opened
about 10 stores similar to Avalon Exchange
since its ﬁrst store in Ann Arbor, Mich. In
1988 Avalon opened in Oakland above Pa-
mela’s Diner, but was moved to Squirrel Hill
17 years later in December 2006..

Another establishment with a similar

a

atmosphere is the 1C Cafe on Murray. The
61C Cafe has been operating in Squirrel Hill
since 1993, and its website says the shop
was opened before coffee shop culture came
into prominence. Its menu offers standard
coffee-shop fare, but the charm of 61C Cafe
is that it is a Pittsburgh and Squirrel Hill
original.

But Squirrel Hill isn’t just for the thrift-
store and coffee-shop crowd. It also features
two Squirrel Hill original pizza shops that
make some, of the best pizza in Pittsburgh.

While Oakland’s pizza rivalry thrives
between the two $5 dollar pizza shops on
Atwood, Sorrento’s and Antoon’s, Squirrel
Hill has its own ongoing pizza battle.

Mineo’s and Aiello’s pizza shops have been
making pizza on the same block of Murray
Avenue since Aiello’s opened shopin 1978.
Mineo’s has been operating since 1958.

While the competition in Oakland is large-
ly cost driven, Mineo’s and Aiello’s rivalry is
all about taste. A Facebook group created
to debate the topic currently has more than

1,800 members.

It might be true that you can’t argue over
taste, but Squirrel Hill residents have been
doing so since 1978, and both pizza shops are
still going strong. There might be no right an-
swer to the question, but with a cut — Pitts-
burghese for slice — from either Mineo’s or
Aiello’s, a pizza enthusiast can’t go wrong.

When dessert time rolls around, Point
Park University junior Tylerjackson makes
a bee-line for the gourmet ice cream shop
Cold Stone Creamery on the comer of Mur-
ray and Forbes.

“They don’t have Cold Stone Downtown
or in Oakland,” Jackson said.

Students also recommend checking out
Manor Theatre for its small digs and interest-
ing movie selection. The four-screenftheater
offers a variety of ﬁlm tastes.

“There’s certainly movies there that
come out on limited release that you can’t
see anywhere else,” Point Park senior Marcus
Johnson said.

Manor Theatre is nestled between Barnes
& Noble Booksellers and Silky’s Pub on Mur-
ray Avenue and often features limited-release
art ﬁlms.

Strip< 14

Ryan Niles lives in South Hills and also
works at Galletta Engineering Corp. He
shares Stewart’s love of the Strip’s wide
variety of food.

“Far and away the best thing about
working in the Strip is the food,” he said.
“A short walk and you have options galore
— Reyna’s Taco Stand, Peace Love and
Little Donuts and Enrico’s Cafe are some
of my favorites.”

The donut shop moved to Smallman

Street in the Strip in 2009 and serves tiny
donuts, about 2 inches in diameter, true
to the shop’s name. .

The bite-size pastries’ aroma mixes
with the smell of the Enrico Biscotti Cafe.
Aromas from the oversized biscotti flow
out onto the sidewalk and mingle with
smells from Mon Aimee Chocolat, which
sells gourmet sweets from 26 countries.

Augustino, Salvatore and Michael Sun-
seri started the The Pennsylvania Maca-
roni Co. in 1902, which is on Penn Ave
near Prirnanti'Bros. Now run by the third
generation of Sunseris, the store stocks
more than 5,000 specialty products and
sells more than 200,000 pounds of cheese
each week.

While the Pennsylvania Macaroni Co.
sells bread from Mancini’s Bakery, it
doesn’t hurt to walk down to the bakery
itself to take in the smell of fresh bread.

Mancini Bread started in 1926, selling
about 100 loaves of bread per night. Over
the years, the bakery has been kept in the
family and now bakes more than 10,000
loaves a day, in varieties including twist
bread, marble rye and pepperoni_log.

A new feature in the Strip District is
The Pittsburgh Flea, a gathering of ven-
dors every Saturday starting injune along
21st and Railroad streets.

Savvy shoppers and merchants from
near and far come together to bring great
deals on one-of-a-kind items. Vendors line
the streets selling antiques, collectibles,
jewelry, vintage clothes, toys, plants, pro-
duce, recycled goods and furniture.

a night out.

Around 10 p.m., the bars begin to
fill up. Music blasts asbouncers check
IDs at the door and welcome the young

and beautiful inside to enjoy the half-off-_

drinks. 

Senior Kayla Reddington said the
South Side is definitely for an older col-
lege crowd. ‘

“You are expected to look classy down

A in South Side,” Reddington said. “It is just

dressy heels and a skirt down there.”

Though classier, the South Side spots
aren’t much more expensive than the bars
in Oakland, Reddington said. They’re just
a little less convenient because they’re not
within walking distance.

The South Side is accessible by a ﬁve-
minute bus ride from Oakland. If the sun
isshining, a quick bike ride across the
Birmingham Bridge’s bike path will get
you there almost as quickly.

But after dark, students recommend

taxis. The Port Authority buses from the
South Side stop running before the bars
close and tend to fill up quickly even when
they’re still running. Reddington advised
that students plan their night trip to the
other side of the Monongahela River be-

forehand.

“Taxis are the mode of transporta-

-V tion for late at night,” Reddington said.

“Since everyone is trying to go out around
the same time, cab company lines are
busy, and you wait up to an hour for a

a more grown-uparea. You’ll ﬁt in wearing

cab sometimes.”

The South Side is noted for its bar
scene, and the most popular locations
that students 21 and older can hit up
include Carson City Saloon, Diesel Club
Lounge, Lava Lounge, Tiki Lounge and
Town Tavern.

Although many students will say the
South Side is exciting and classy, not ev-
eryone agrees.

Councilman Bruce Kraus is among the
m_ore vocal detractors of the revelry asso-
ciated with the South Side’s nightclubs.

Not—so-classy complaints of the area
include people running through the
streets, trash layering the sidewalks and
rising crime rates. ,

According to the Pittsburgh Bureau of
Pol_ice’s 2009 Annual Report, the South
Side had 107 reports of violent crimes and
719 reports of property crime.

There have been attempts to imple-
ment legislation to limit liquor licenses
in the area, but no such measures have
come to fruition yet. ﬂ

Bloomﬁeld offers restaurants

Bloomﬁeld < 16

Gregg LaFace, a Bloomﬁeld resident‘,
said students should “go slow and just look

_ around” to ﬁnd what they’re looking for in

the neighborhood. »
“You can’t get bored in Bloomﬁeld,”
he said.
Boredom is far from residents’ minds

during the last-weekend of September’

when Bloomﬁeld hosts Little Italy Days.
This celebration of Italian culture takes
place on Liberty Avenue and features Ital-
ian food, live music and dancing.

Aside from cultural celebrations, the
neighborhood also holdsa Halloween Pa-
rade, the Gay Pride Parade and the Colum-
bus Day Parade.

Community events are not all Bloom-
ﬁeld has to offer. Neighborhood hot spots
include Paul’s CDs, ‘Crazy Mocha and Pizza
Italia. _

Peter Bova, chef at Bloomﬁeld’s Lot 17
Bar & Grill, also commented on the neigh-
borhood’s low prices — an aspect of a
neighborhood visit that college students’
wallets will thank them for later.’ -

Bova said he frequents Donatelli’s Ital-
ian Food Center, a family-owned market
that offers imported, authentic Italian
goods. Bova said this included a good deal
on espresso chocolates — ﬁve for $3.

A short walk down Liberty Avenue and a
right on Penn Avenue leads into Garﬁeld.

Students are best able to soak in the
artsy vibes of Garﬁeld at Unblurred, the
neighborhood’s First Friday monthly art
crawl. Starting at around 7 p.m., all of
the neighborhood’s art venues open their
doors to eager art enthusiasts. Free food
and beverages are an added bonus.

If looking at art isn’t enough, Unblurred
also often provides onlookers with op-
portunities to get involved in the creative
process.

“ In the past, the art viewers have been
able to participate in glass making with the
Pittsburgh Glass Center and dance classes
at Dance Alloy Theater. I '

“It’s deﬁnitely worth it [to go to Un-
blurred] if you’re into art,” said Rich-
ard Walters, a lawyer and graduate of
Duquesne’s School of Law.

While he might have to be serious by A

day, Walters also gets in on the art scene
Friday night and holds tango lessons in his
ofﬁce during the monthly crawl.

Walters encouraged students to take
advantage of the free tango lessons closer
to home above Peter’s Pub in Oakland on

' Wednesdays at 8 p.m.

The neighborhood of Lawrenceville,
home to UPMC’s Children’s Hospital, is
also on Penn Avenue.

Bova not only commented on his.fa-
vorite Bloomﬁeld cuisine, he also recom-

mended Sammy’s Famous Corned Beef in
Lawrenceville.

“[It’s a] great place for cheap sand-'

wiches,” Bova said.

Lawrenceville is not biased toward any
type of cuisine —- Mexican, Vietnamese
and Italian represent just a few of the din-
ing possibilities. A

‘.‘I was with two friends,” Matula said.
“They laughed at me more than anything
else.” ’

It ‘didn’t help that Matula had to walk all
the way back to Panther Hall sopping wet.
‘ ‘ “It was deﬁnitely cold,” he said.
Matula, full of advice about the park,
offers another warning to those who want
to jog on the many paths.
“Look very carefully at the map before
i you go on one of the trails,” he said, adding

that he’s gotten lost a few times.

A good place to get lost, on the other
hand, is Phipps Conservatory, a beautiful
botanical garden built in 1893, also located
in _Schenley'Park. All Pitt students can visit
Phipps for free during the school year with
their student IDs.

Two ‘years ago, President Barack Obama
ate dinner among the ﬂowers withworld
leaders at a G—2o Summit reception. ’

Schenley Park boasts a history that is just
as interesting as the natural and man—made

features of the park. t
According to the Park website, Schenley
Park was originally known as the Mt. Airy

‘Tract. The land belonged to a woman named

Mary Schenley, who almost didn’t inherit
the land when she eloped to England with
a man named Capt. Edward Schenley. This
was amove her parents didn’t approve of,
and her father tried to cut her out of his
will.

But they reconciled before he _died, and
Schenley received the land.

 

onus ARE, YOU’RENOT GOING
TO HAVE A Top TEN soma.

lot of history behind it

In 1889, Edward, Bigelow, Pittsburgh’s‘
director of Public Works, wanted to try to
convince Schenley to donate the land to
the city as part of a larger vision he had of a
park system for the city. However, Bigelow
learned that a real estate developer‘ had
plans to travel to London to buy the land
from Schenley. V y

In order to beat out the realtor, Bigelow 1
sent a lawyer from East Liberty to London. ,
He traveled by train from Pittsburgh to New 
York before getting on a boat to cross the P
ocean. L

The lawyer beat the real estate developer

~ by two days,a'nd Schenley agreed to donate .

the park on two conditions: that it would
be named after her and thatthe city never
sell it. She donated 300 acres to the city,
and the city bought another 120 acres from
Schenley two years later.

The city then expanded the park by ﬁlling
in a ravine that is now Schenley Plaza and _
built three bridges to make the park more
accessible from Oakland and the other sur-
rounding neighborhoods. V V

The park also used to be home to a ca- '
sino, which sat on the land that is now the
Frick Fine Arts building, as well as a fountain ,
on top of Flagstaff Hill that had light shows ,
at night. A T

In the summer, instead of a light show, i
Flagstaff Hill hosts outdoor movies free

~ to the public on Sunday .and Wednesday

nights. This is just one of the newer attrac- *

t tions to add to the list of features that have
’ brought Pittsburghers to Schenley Park for

120 years.

Waterfront for its diverse stores.
“The Waterfront is bigger than South
Side and closer than Ross Park Mall,” Un-
derwood said. “You get a lot of shopping
I done.” ,
The South Side, located about a mile
from Oakland, features smaller stores
scattered throughout the neighborhood.
The Ross Park Mall is in Ross Township,
about 10 miles from Oakland, and features
more upscale stores such as Burberry, La-

coste and Nordstrom.

For students such as Underwood, shop-

ping at the Waterfront includes stops in
the big—box stores and discount retailers
there. Target, Best Buy, T._].Maxx, Mar-
shalls and Costco all dot the Waterfront’s
landscape.

up an appetite when walking between all
of the stores at the Waterfront. "Luckily,

Schaff: Do
the music

. ‘ Matt Schaff

 

Columnist

As it’s the dawn of your career
at Pitt, the master plan might
go something like this: Learn
new things, get good grades and
squeeze “fun” into every space in
between. But whatever terms you
choose to describe your soon—to-

_‘ begin four—year brush with higher

education — be it about what jobs
Pitt will prepare you for or perhaps
what hot collegians you can pull
off the lawn and into your extra-
long twin bed — be sure to learn
from the mistakes of upperclass-
men. Because good students like
speciﬁcs, I searched my brain for
unhackneyed advice, and here’s
what I found: Don’t give up on the
music.

Before you inveigh your fresh-

(a ‘man disgust against the The Pitt

News for publishing such sick-
eningly obvious rubbish —— you
might ask, for example, where
would the music industrybe with-
out college students hungry for
concerts and LPs? _— realize my
focus isn’t on listening to music,

school quit, comfortably consign-
ing themselves to a lifetime of mu-
sical silence.

Freshmen, don’t‘let yourself
become comfortable. You’re giving
up too much.

Like brain function — well,
maybe. In April, researchers at
Emory University published a
study ﬁnding that more experi-
ence making music during your
lifetime correlates with better
general performance on cognitive
tests when you reach advanced
ages. The authors suspect the cog-

’ nitive challenge of music creation

is responsible for the differences,
and they predict — without evi-
dence, yet — that their results
will have signiﬁcant implications
for Alzheimer’s disease research.
Granted, the literature on mu-
sic’s effects on the brain is small
and largely unrepeated, but past
studies have loudly suggested that
musical training imparts cognitive
beneﬁts for children.
Unfortunately, while there
might be a link between music
playing and cognition, college stu-
dents apparently are either too old
to prime their brains with music

Freshmen, don’t
let yourself become

up too much.

P’ but rather the creation of music.

That is, for those of you who’ve
had the privilege of playing instru-
ments in yesteryear, don’t under-
estimate what making music can
do for youlin college.

Although it’s perhaps most visi-
ble, weight isn’t the only thing that
can change between high school
and college. Along with wealth and
work ethic, music involvement, in
my experience, seems to plummet

,‘_as soon as students learn where
frat parties are held and where to

buy $5 pizzas. In fact, a signiﬁcant
percentage of the people I know
" who playe'd’instrume'nts in high ‘

comfortable. You’re giving

notes or too young to experience
their dementia-ﬁghting effects.
So odds are science won’t win you
over this time.

But maybe my fancy word-
smithing can.

It’s about freedom, and it’s
about expression. If you’ve met
me, you’d know I’m an unlikely
candidate to be offering this kind
of advice. You’d probably prefer
to have a student virtuoso writ-
ing this column, someone who’s
lived through all the substance
and glamour the musical life can
muster and then come back to

Jtellyou about it; The truth is that ‘ lege is all about. | ‘

n’t give up on

with six years of learning a brass
instrument — French horn —- I
can’t attest to much in terms of
decorations. But it’s my history of
amateurism that I believe makes
my perspective especially appro-
priate.

My point is, I was in the same
situation in which you might ﬁnd
yourself with your forgone in-
strument — just replace “French
horn” with “clarinet” or “violin”
or ‘‘vocal chords.” Without star-
reaching musical aspirations and
with a billion other academic re-
sponsibilities, I was teetering on
the verge of losing it forever — I
came to Pitt and put the horn away
for what I once thought was for
good. But a year and a half after
moving to college, I started tak-
ing lessons again, and doing so
was the best decision I made last
semester.

Why? The ability to play my in-
strument at leisure — free from
the pressures of parents, free from
the ‘eyes of college admissions of-
ﬁces and free from the blind inter-
nal ambitions of fame and success
— enriched me in ways I didn’t
predict. You could say the horn
functioned as a 5-pound brass
stress ball, but you’d be missing
something crucial. After all, if you
can stomach the idea of people
having platonic “relationships”

V with inanimate objects, that term,

would be a more accurate descrip-
tor. With the time and focus to de-
vote to learning the fundamentals,
playing the horn keyed me in on
my own strengths and weaknesses,
and it served as a place to uniquely

express my frustrations. No, metal ,

tubes and nylon strings are not
people, but what music-giver-
uppers too often forget is how
music-making as a platform for
expression cannot be rivaled and
cannot be substituted. Continuing
a relationship with your instru-
ment doesn’t mean marrying it
or trading it in for a sustainable
career. It means actively taking ad-
vantage of another way to describe
yourself, another way to educate
yourself about the nuances of your
identity and interests. And hey,
identity-discovering is what col-

I haven’t read Stephen Chbosky’s

all aboutitsupcoming cinematic inter-

pretation (to be ﬁlmed in Pittsburgh,

as you might have heard), but I do

consider myselfqualiﬁed to comment
on the basic pros and cons of fading
into the background. My credentials

come in the form of 18-plus years of
being shy and four rewarding and un-

predictable semesters at Pitt working
to overcome it.

WhenI gtaduatedfromhighschool,
I felt plainly and painfully that much
of my time there had been wasted be-
cause of my tendency to hang toward
the back. Miraculously — thanks to
a potent combination of encourag-
ing friends, campus involvement and
gradually increasing self-appreciation
—I cansaythat,forme, mytime here
at Pitt has truly been different. Now
it’syourtumtothinkaboutwhatyou

Don’tbe shy.

The ﬁrst time my mom called me
a wallﬂower, I was ﬂattered. My fam-
ily and I were at a wedding reception,
and, as an 8-year—oldwho knew onlya
handﬁllofthe attendees, Iwasn’treally

“Cathy, honey, you don’t want to be a

asked when she came over to visit me
standing on the very periphery of the
polished hardwood space. Partially to
delayﬁirther involvementintheparty,
I asked her what the tenn wallﬂower
meant.

Assoonassheﬁnishedher explana-

yes, I did wantto be awallﬂower. Stay-

“Bateman: Wow your teachers with slick Wordsmithing

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

  
 

According to a debate we might have '

encountered on the Wikipedia dis-
cussion boards, the toughest part
..of the transition from high school
it0 college involves learning how
-to write a good term paper. Back

V -“in those AP English courses, you

=:c0uld earn a “5” on your prompt
. through the mere act of composing a
eparagraph that contained correctly

spelled words spread amongahand—
.ful of punctuation marks.

But this kind of stuff won’t ﬂy
at a big—time research University
that regularly qualiﬁes for the NCAA
Tournament. Instead, you’ll have to
hit the books if you want to write
an award—winning paper on a hot
topic like the Founding Fathers. But
goodness, with a fall TV lineup like
the Dana Delany—fronted one as-
sembled by ABC, who has time for
that noise?

Here’s where we come in,‘

friends. We’re going to take you
step-by-step through the develop-
ment of the greatest paper anyone

has ever written on those beloved
Founding Fathers.

Every legendary piece of writ-
ing starts with a memorable open-
ing line. For example, Ford Madox
Ford’s novel “The Good Soldier”
kicks off with “This is the saddest
story I have ever heard.” Vladimir
Nabokov commences “Lolita” with
“Lolita, light of my life, ﬁre of my
loins.” Samuel Beckett leaps into
“Murphy” by means of “The sun
shone, having no alternative, on the
nothing new.” Let’s push this paper
out of the gate with a powerhouse
ﬁrst sentence:

“Dear Mr. (Professor? Dr.? Mr.
Doctor? Look this up!), hope you
had a good summer. I was at the
beach, just balling and getting at it.
Maybe you know what I mean? Any-
way, on the way I passed through
Washington —— aka “the District’?
—- and started thinking about those
Founding Fathers of ours-.”

Whoa! We’re willing to bet our
lives and our sacred honor that your
Mr._Doctor Professor has never read
a paper that started this way. Unlike
your peers, who are -going to begin
with boring paragraphs plagiarized

out of some dusty old Encyclopaedia
Britannica, you personalized your
narrative. In addition to striking a
hip pose — what could be hipper
than “balling” and “getting at i ”‘
while visiting a beach? —— you’ve

managed to explain why the Found-

' ing Fathers are more than just a pa-

per topic to you. Can you maintain
this head of steam? Time to ﬁnd
out:

“Those Founding Fathers made
so manydifferent things that are
out there today. In addition to the
Constitution, there was also a Dec-
laration(W1kipedia). Without these,
there wouldn’t be, for example, a
Rita’s Water Ice on Fifth Avenue
right here in Oakland (Wikipedia).
There was also a Wendy’s nearby,
but it closed (Wikipedia).”.

In our opinion, this is the best
second paragraph anyone could
have possibly written. Here, you’re
demonstrating to the professor that
you know how to use MLA citation
format — a must for any college
paper! — and that you’re aware of
your surroundings. By mentioning
Rita’s Water Ice, as well as that un-
fortunate Wendy’s, you’ve triggered

Mr. Doctor Professor’s Pavlovian
drooling response (a concept that
you probably overheard something
aboutwhile using angry birds to kill
green pigs on your iPhone during
a rousing Intro to Psychology lec-
ture). Atthis point, you’re probably
exhausted —- this work-in—progress
would’ve earned an A+ at any on-
line charter high school in America,
to be sure — but there’s more to
come. ’

“In the end, when I or you or
even we think about the Founding
Fathers, it is easy to forget the dif-
ferent accomplishments they might
have made. Without the Declaration
and the Constitution (Wikipedia),
it is unlikely that I could purchase
such a sweet treat at Rita’s Water
Ice on Fifth Avenue. There might
not be any avenues at all, let alone
a ﬁfth, and this is something easy
to forget about in the midst/middle/
amidst of what’s going on today with
the different wars such as Katrina
(and also Liberia). To close out and
sum up, these were the Founding
Fathers, and it is always better for
that (Wikipedia).

Peace and love,

Your Student

P.S. Iam goingto watch the Cava-
Hers game tonight (boo LeBron! .
Let me know if things are good with
you.” I

No simple description can do ‘$3
justice to your conclusion. In ad- I

dition to putting. forward the ﬁnal
word on the Founding Fathers,
you’ve given Mr. Doctor Professor
another glimpse of who you are as
a person — a committed Cleveland
Cavaliers fan who believes in peace
and love and genuinely cares about
what Mr. Doctor Professor does in
his free time. In fewer than 300
words, you’ve managed to show
every jaded academic that there is

hope for the future of this great na-dd

tion. George Washington, Thomas
Edison, Billy Madison and all of the
other Founding Fathers would be
proud.

Olivia Garber
Managing Editor

This isn’t a good time to be a college
student.

‘ College tuition is rising, the job
market isn’t welcoming and national
student loan debt has just surpassed
credit card debt.

And_if that’s not enough, some
pundits are even tossing around the
notion that a degree isn’t even worth
it. That students don’t even learn any-
thing, anyway. That, even aiter two
years in college, halfof students show
no improvement in critical thinking.

To break that down for you, col-

lege students are broke, dumb and

spending thousands 01 dollars for a
worthless piece ofpaper. _

But don’t despair, new student.
Because even if college is quickly be-
comingaﬁnancial liability, there’s still
a way to emerge victorious after four
years: You have to play the game.

Perhaps this is a cynical approach
to higher education, but I’ve already
spent three years in college, and what
I’ve learned is that there’s away to suc-

Last semester marked a momen-

was devastating.’ But what stung the
most wasn’t the damage it did to my
GPA, it was the class itself: Introduc-
tion to Microeconomics. “This was
supposed to be easy,” I wailed to my
mother, utterly distraught.

Thatbasically sums up my attitude
toward college classes. I expect them
to be easy. Whenl sign up for courses,
I scour RateMyProfessors.com and
cross—reference the results with com-
ments from friends. Iwon’ttakeaclass

the challenge of taking a hard class

simply isn’t worth it -— especially if
it’s a Gen Ed. Intro to Microeconomics

wasprobably one ofthe most difficult

classes I’ve taken at Pitt. I struggle with

spatial concepts, especially graphs,

which made this class an absolute

nightmare. «

Did IntrotoMicro push meto learn
unfamiliar concepts and amend my
weaknesses? Absolutely. Was itworth
it? Nope. s

It hurt my GPA, my pride and did
nothingfor my major. The most useful

drop harder classes.

Some might say that your GPA
doesn’t matter — see the ‘above ex-

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Kozlowski: College and high school antithetical 1

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

  

After 12 years of schooling, you
have made it to college and are
ﬁnally a grown—up —— sort of.
Congratulations! What now?
I Well,ﬁrst you have to get into
this whole college thing, which
.-can be difficult. College is not like
.,,high school, and the sooner you
realize that and adapt, the faster

;"you’ll be something other than an

"obvious freshman.
, As you’re probably already
aware, one of the most impor-
tant differences between college
and high school is scale. I don’t
know the majority of people in
the majority of my classes, and
I never will. I don’t even know
all the people in my year or in
{either of my majors. Of course,
gsize isn’t entirely a badthing.
._;We have facilities that would be
-,hard to justify in a smaller school.
,,With so many people, odds are
;.some of them are studying a
[topic you know nothing about,
such as Icelandic sagas. The key

is not to letthe size of this place
overwhelm you —— be social the
ﬁrst few weeks of freshman year
and get involved in some sort of
activity. Once you know people
on campus, the campus shrinks
a bit. There are two other conse-
quences of size, though.

Relationships "

The sheer size of Pitt means
that you might not bump into
people very often. Sure, there will
be people you see all the time, but

‘ after the semester and schedules

change, you might not see them
again for a while. This is entirely
unlike the situation in even a very
large high school, where it was
unusual not to see a particular
person you knew and liked for
more than about a week. Here, I
routinely won’t see a close friend
of mine for two weeks, and when
I do see him or her, it’s because
we called each other and said,
“Let’s do lunch.” Maintaining
relationships with people takes
more effort here than it did in
high school, because you simply
don’t see people around. So be
ready to phone or use Facebook

more purposefully than you once
did. ’ T

Talent

In college, the saying that
“you’re special, just like everyone
else” is very true. I’ve witnessed
a lot of people who were in the
top 5 percent of their high school
class and leaders of every stu-
dent group suddenly realize that
there are a lot of people with that
background on this campus. This
sudden change in status from
outstanding to just pretty good
can really unnerve some people.
Many make the mistake of fall-
ing prey to insecurity and petty
games of one—upsmanship. The
proper response to this pool of
excellence? Celebrate it! There

are a lotof interesting and tal- _

ented people on this campus, and
discovering them should be a j oy,
not a cause for insecurity.

Aside from these, the biggest
change between college and high
school is the amount of personal
liberty. Unless you are living with
your parents, you set your own
ground rules. You are free to-
be out as late as you want with

whomever you want whenever
you want. You canskip class and
often nobody will care. Your par-
ents will have only a vague idea
of what you are doing day to day,
and most of the time what they
know is limited to what you tell
them. You are free.

_ Unfortunately, you are also
free to do things that might get
you arrested or expelled. With
luck, there will be people around
you to prevent you from making
bad decisions — people like RAs,
your parents, c-lergymen and oth-
ers you respect. But these people
have less inﬂuence over you than
they did when you were in high
school. Meanwhile, there are
other people who might try to
take advantage of your inexperi-

C ence. This doesn’t mean “OMG,

serial killers and rapists behind
every bush,” but you will encoun-
ter small—time swindlers on the
street who will try to con you out
of a couple of bucks.’ This is not
to say you should walk around
paralyzed by mindless fear or that
you should join a monastery. Just
be aware that liberty also means

the liberty to screw up royally. C »

Lastly, college requires more
self—motivation than high school
did. Nobody will nag you about
ﬁnishing assignments. If you have
difficulties, nobody will notice

until you tell them. College dead—‘'‘’
.. lines are often long—term, which

means you need to go at your own
pace. It is extremely unusual to
have homework given that is due
next class_. Most assignments are
due in a week or three. Neverthe-
less, avoid procrastination at all
costs,'as it can lead to attempting
to ﬁnish an impossible amount of
work in a short period of time, en-
gendering slipshod results. Work
a little bit on each project you

have each day and the problerﬁ"

of time management takes care of
itself. Working on homework or
projects bit by bit makes the proj-
ect seem much less daunting, and
when faced with a less—daunting
problem, it is easier to motivate
oneself to ﬁnish it.

In college, you can also tell
opinions columnists they’re full
of it. Write kozthought@gmail.

I .

A l A A Lexie Bond
For The Pitt News

  

Whenlwas afreshman in 2007, my high school
friend came to Pitt to visit me for my birthday.
Amazed by how many guys were on campus,

she asked me if any of them ever approached.

me and hit on me. The word “no” had barely
escaped my lips whena guy did indeedwalkup
and ask my name. With our heads both cocked

confusedly to the left, my friend and I scrunched '

our faces bewilderedly before the guy walked
away, sadly muttering, “I’m just trying to meet
people,” under his breath.

As you’ve probably already assumed, Pitt is
just as much a hook-up wonderland as it is an
academic dream world. But surely not everyone
wants to get laid. In myifour years at Pitt, I’ve
accumulated plenty of tips for making sure a
man won’t join you in bed — even if you had
a bag over your ugly mug. Of course, I learned
all these rules by accident -4 I wasn’t trying to

coﬂege

fantastic, they also serve to send a message
— that message being, “Come f**k me.” My
recommendation‘? A pair of Oxfords. These
shoes are fashionable enough to get away with
amongst your fellow females while still sending
the message to men that, “Sure, I could have
sex with you, but I’d rather go alphabetize my
Hugh Grant DVD collection.”

. Now that you’re dressed like a prude, let’s
consider what you should say to the man that
dares to attempt to penetrate your les_s—than-
interested bubble. Consider insultinghis major.
Many men are sensitive about this for some
reason. Especially law school students. A guy
in a bar was once bragging to me about being
a law school student at Pitt when I made the
mistake of saying, “I thought Pitt wasn’t a very
good law school?” The guy then became more
interested in defending his debt-accumulating
school choice and less interested in me and my
conservative cardigan. Looking back, I can’t
even blame him for getting worked up. It must
suck to get rejected from Harvard. _‘

Now that you’re dressed like a
prude,‘ let’sconsider What you
should say to the man that dares
attem t to penetrate your less-—
than—1nterested bubble. P  

ensure I ended all my nights alone save for a $5
pizza and an old Freddie Prinzejr. movie. Butl
don’t see why they can’t be applied to help out
people who generally wish to avoid attention
to their “south of the borders.”

_ First, let’s consider how you’re dressed.
Over the years, I’ve come to recognize what
I like to‘ call “the freshman girl uniform.”'The
only difference over the years is the length of

the denim shorts — somehow, they just keep _ _
getting shorter with each incoming class. The I

barely-there denim dental ﬂoss is complement-

, edbywhatever-ﬂoraltanktopAmericanEagle.is

selling at the time. It’s the exact same ﬂoral tank

_ top, but generally comes in red ﬂoral, green

ﬂoral and blue ﬂoral. Top that offwith aPanther
Card—bearing Pitt lanyard and some flip-ﬂops,
and you’ve got the freshman girl uniform.

If you don’t want to get laid, deﬁnitely don’t
fall victim to this uniform. Instead, I’ve come
across a few items of clothing no one has ever
hit on me whilelwaswearing. Firstoff and most
importantly, the turtleneck. I don’t care how

I » hot it is outside, if you’re committed to keeping

your legs closed, then you must sweat in that

man—repelling chest and neck protector.

. , Next, let’s consider footwear. Most heels

what I like to call “rn_arriage material.” Sure,
they’re probablya little off their rocker, but
they’re also probably more likely to be suc-

T cessful. They also might be willing to watch,

THE STAMATTACK

 

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

The high point of your college ex-
perience was your Pittstart. After
two carefree days of icebreakers,
new phone numbers and madly

I texting the people they belong
*to, all college has to offer you is
L failed term papers, bad hang-
 overs and 20 pounds.

You might have guessed as

 much —— high school, after all,
t was pretty rad. In fact, if you
‘think you have met the coolest

people in the world already and
that expanding your horizons
would be pointless, Iwould agree.
You clearly understand what you

‘like about the world. But you
i will still need to amuse yourself

somehow in case you choose to
stay overnight, or a couple days

longer, at Pitt. Accordingly, I

have compiled the best tips for

enjoying —— well, tolerating —

your new life.

Any incoming student should
spend all downtime at the be-
ginning of the year investigat-

SHADYSIDE

ing campus restrooms to create a
mental bathroom hierarchy. The
University probably owns more
toilets than any organization
on this side of the Alleghenies,
so it’s important that you have
a top-three list in mind for any
location on campus. This way,

when you ﬁnd yourself scram-'

bling between Clapp Hall and
Alumni Hall, you won’t be caught
in a frenzied panic, unnecessar-
ily pacing through buildings. I
don’t know what you’ll like —
you might ﬁnd yourself partial
to the old world charm offered
by Allen Hall stalls, or you might
prefer the dungeon-like vibes of
the basement of David Lawrence.
Either way, you will be doing
yourself a favor later by using
idle time now.

After this, take a nap, re-
charge and start playing games
on Sporcle, the online quiz site
designed to be as addictive as
Fruit Gushers, but without the
sugar high and subsequent crash.
Here, you can spend innumer-
able seven—minute periods of

Keeping boredom at bay

your life attempting to name all
the presidents of the Philippines.
After hours of toiling to list ev-
eryone from Emilio Aguinaldo to
Benigno Aquino III, you should
probably go back to looking for
bathrooms.

Any day of loafing at Pitt
would be incomplete without
a very necessary journey onto
Facebook. Look at your old pic-
tures several times every day and
fondly remember that time your
friend laughed so hard milk came
out of his nose. There is nobody
of that -high quality at Pitt. Every-
body herelstinks, especially The
Pitt News columnists.

If you happen to be near
Schenley Park, go there to help
pass the time between loneliness
and Intro to Critical Reading. The
area was recently named one of
coolest city parks by Travel + Lei-
sure Magazine, so there has_to be
something good about it besides
sleeping hobos and the ﬂuores-
cent Panther Hollow Lake. One

WHAT THE BELL?

Bell: Don’t judge 
people prematurely

 

’ Contributing Editor

You usually know when you aren’t
going to like someone.

Maybe it’s something small

about him or her that irks you --
she wears the same dowdy sandals
as your middle-aged mother or he
still styles his hair like a member
of a ’90s boy band. Or maybe it’s
the person’s whole character —-
the fact that when she walks into
a room, you can tell she thinks
-she’s awesome.

Nevertheless, your precon-
ceived notions — much like an
overstuffed backpack — will slow
you down in college. A

Here’s a personal example: At
the very beginning of my fresh-
man year, this guy walked into my
ﬁrst-ever class —— one that was a
requirement for my learning com-
munity, at that — and I decided
we weren’t going to be friends.

Natalie Bell‘

It was obvious this guy knew
he was pretty cute and was used;
to other people thinking the
same. While all the other girls
in my learning community were
fawning over him, I was making
sarcastic cracks.

But one day, he started talking
to me about our similar upbring-
ings across the lunch table, and
I moved down to sit across from
him. Suddenly, and without warn-
ing, he became my friend. And
not just a casual friend, but one
of my closest. ‘ A

Not to get all “after school spe-
cial with an obvious moral,” but,
in that situation, I was kind of be-
ing the jerk. I learned a lesson: Get
to know people, even when you’re
sure you won’t like "them.

That being said, however, I’ve
also learned another, equally im-
portant lesson: You absolutely do
not have to like everyone.

COLUMN

Tybout: Prepa

friend groups after freshman year

Andy Tybout
Opinions Editor

 

Sometime during the winter of
2009, in a moment of freshman
year spontaneity, nearly every-
one on my dorm ﬂoor ventured
outside for a night of sledding
on the snow-laden lawn outside
the Petersen Events Center. For
rides, we used cardboard sheets
and plastic lids, and for hills, we
employed the abrupt slopes trail-
ing down from the walkway near
Pennsylvania Hall.

v'W My recollection of that night

has been obscured and idealized,
but I do distinctly remember an
older student asking our ﬂoor to
gather for a group photo. He was
working on a project, we were told,
about the fragmentation of friend
groups throughout college.

We assembled cheerfully, he
took the photo and the night
continued. Within minutes, we’d
entirely forgotten his ominous

investigation.
I’m now a senior, and I haven’t.

spoken to most of the people in
that photo in more than ayear. De-

spite our once intense solidarity, _

we’ve largely gone our separate

_ ways.

That’s not to say I’ve distanced
myself from everyone who lived in
Sutherland West — in fact, both
my current roommates hail from
that original network — but rather
that the casual, neighborly friend-
ships so commonplace during the
ﬁrst year of college have been jet-
tisoned, leaving a small circle of
companions.

My case is not an anomaly. Dur-
ing the upcoming year, you’ll likely
meet and befriend more people
than at any other period of your
life. Your Facebook friend count
will skyrocket. You will join several
campus organizations and mingle
with countless personable strang-
ers. You will, for atime, allow your-
self the delusion that you’re amass-
ing an inexhaustible, panoramic

social network.

Soon, however, certain people‘

will gravitate toward each other
and feel less willing to step outside
their comfort zones-. The roving
packs of freshmen searching out
frat parties will dwindle to three
or four members. The impromptu
seating arrangements at Market
Central will give way to set, inﬂex-
ible groups.

This is neither a good thing nor
a bad thing — merely the inevi-
table outcome of acclimating to a
new environment. After college’s
initial culture shock —- that j arring
absence of familiarity that prompts
everyone to seek out new experi-
ences and re-establish some sort
of foothold in the world — the dust
will settle, and students will ﬁnd
themselves with more or less the
same amount of real friends they
had in high school.

It’s imperative, then, that by the
end of freshman year you identify
those with whom you’d be willing
to spend the next three years of

your life. Although you’ll likely be
able to count some 50 underclass-
men as your acquaintances, there’s
only a select amount of people you
can rely upon come housing selec-
tion time for sophomore year.

V All this might seem like advice
for the remote future, and indeed,
the ﬁrst semester of college is an
epoch in itself. But the task of
searching out your True Friends,
if you’ll pardon the Hallmark card-
ready expression, begins as soon as

you move into your dorm. It might I

be impossible to initially tell who
they are, as peoples’ true colors
are rarely on display at ﬁrst, but
within a few months, the keepers
will come into sharper focus.

At the risk of sounding like a
dating site, a shared sense of hu-
mor is one of the best indicators
of compatibility, as is an ability
to sustain lively, extended-con-
versations. Political viewpoints,
musical tastes and other Facebook
identiﬁers should not be assigned
the same weight —— my current

re for the fragmentation of  

clique falls all over the ‘spectrum
on the latter three fronts— and
couldn’t be more cohesive. Mostly,
you’ll have to use your intuition —
there’s no foolproof formula for
determining friendship.

In manyways, college preﬁgures
life: The same trend toward more
focused, closer-knit relationships
recurs as people transition from a

‘ frenzied youth to a subdued middle

age. But that’s a discussion for an—__
other day. For now, just remember
that the older student we met while
sledding was onto something —

friend groups do fragment; it’s a

simple fact of maturing. Prepar-
ing for the fallout, then, is one of
the most important measures you
can take as you navigate freshman
life —besides, of course, staying
abreast of your studies.

But being a good student is

. easy — just get the notes from

your friends.

GOOD GRIEF

 

Good: College an opportunity to live green

Mike Good
For The Pitt News

It’s 2011, baby —— a new, envi-
ronmentally conscious decade
is in full swing. As you begin to
pack your empty dormitoryfull
of knick—knacks and personal
touches, also try to think about
living your undergraduate career
as greenly as possible.

These days, “green” isn’t just
a moral choice, it’s an economic
one — and there are many col-
lege—related sustainable practic-
es that can save you substantial
amounts of money.

Most green decisions aren’t
ﬂashy. Although solar robots and
electric cars dominate the me-
dia, simple decisions often pack
a harder punch. For example, do
you know whats better than driv-
ing around campus in a hybrid
car? Riding a bike or walking.

Buying a reusable water bottle
is also a modest but important
measure. I understand people’s
general fear of tap water, but
bottled water is expensive and

tap water is safe —— at least at Pitt.
If you buy a case of water every
week at $5 per case, you’re wast-
ing $100 per year. The bottom
line is that you’re going to save
money, and within a week of us-
ing a reusable water bottle, you
will wind up doubly hydrated and
scarcely recognizing the differ-

ence between tap and Fiji water.
., .  

     

    

.1...‘
j.

The same technique goes for
coffee. Most coffee shops will be
happy to ﬁll up your thermos, and
many will charge you less money
for bringing your own mug. For
example, Caribou Coffee will
charge you 50 cents less than its

regular ounce—calculated price.
Starbucks even gave out free cof-
fee if you brought your own mug
on Earth Day.

If you’re looking to be a loyal
Pitt student, the Book Center
sells Pitt-themed water bottles
and thermoses. If you don’t care
for aesthetics, Rite Aid and CVS
also carry these reusable materi-

als. And even though you have to
wash them, one set of hard silver-
ware is vastly superior to a box of
plastic spoons and forks.

On thatnote, eliminate or mit-
igate your dependence on plastic
bags. I’m not sure if Pittsburgh

 

will see a ban on these bags any
time soon, but you have a chance
to get ahead of the game. When
I walk through Schenley Park,
I just get sad when I see plastic
bags billowing in trees. As a stu-
dent, you probably own a book
bag 4 use it for storage whenever
possible. ,

The most difficult task is actu-
ally tempering your energy con-
sumption. In the dorms, students

don’t have to pay separately for «

heating and electricity. But here’s
one reason why you should try to
minimize the amount of energy
you use: Dorms are practice for
living off—campus. Most students
will abandon the dorms by ju-
nior year, and once you do live
off campus, you have to pay your
utilities, and that sucks. So -start
learning to save energy, water
and heating now, because it will
make your transition into the real
world that much smoother.

On a ﬁnal note, paper and
printing are also sources of waste
on campus. Print only when you
have a real need, and forgo the
50-page poster slideshow unless

you’re sure it will look very cool.

It’s too easy for us to abuse our
900—page printing quota, and
as of yet, Pitt does not purchase
the more expensive 100 percent-

recycled paper, Yalmaz Siddiqui, I
Office Depot’s director of envi-'

ronmental strategy, said at Pitt’s
Buy it Green Supplier Showcase
last April.

If you’re able to take any of
these suggestions to heart, you
will help build a greener and
more sustainable campus and
lifestyle. If you’re interested in
any of these issues, get involved
early. Join Pitt environmental
groups like Free the Planet. Stay

connected on www.pittenviron-F

mental.org. Convince Chancellor‘
Mark Nordenberg to get Pitt on
the Presidents’ Climate Commit-
ment plan, which would force Pitt
to come up with a concrete set of
sustainability objectives.

In the end, keep it simple:
Use only what you need, recycle
when you can and as a personal

courtesy, don’t throw your empty I

pizza boxes onto Atwood Street
— it’s gross. ‘:13 »

lugos: In college, disregard childhoodaxioms

Alicia Dlugos
For The Pitt News

Freshman year of college is a time to
put all the lessons you’ve learned in
your ﬁrst 18 years of life into prac-
tice — or so conventional wisdom
hi lds. Of course, I think it’s safe to
s y that, for most of us, life has been

led with seemingly trivial rulesand
rdgulations. And if you were any-

tlling like me, you often found your: .

9 sélfbreaking them for one reason
or another.

 But once you arrive at college,
you’re on your own. No one will scold
you fora messy room (except rr aybe
your roommate), no one will nag you
about preparing for ﬁnals (unless
you have a helicopter parent) and no
ohe will enforce any curfews. So now
it:’s up to you to decide which rules to
hpnor and which to disregard.

 Luckily, I’ve come up with a few

‘ftirmerly useful childhood axioms
that you should deﬁnitely consider
férgetting, or at least occasionally
disregarding.

i Lesson number one: “Don’t talk
to strangers!”

AS AN 0l3‘l“lCEl{ IN 'l‘Hl?. U.S. AIR FORCIE, YOU IAN C'l‘0l’ LOOKING.

'§$’IlH.IZ SI§Il\’li\’G Yliiiill :\‘.?\'l‘IﬂN, \"0fF’i.!. JXLSO I§.=I\R\" A (I(}3'ii’§i'i‘i'§‘l\’l§ S.-MARY, Fkiiii «.VI’l%Il')lC.-"-‘ll. (,‘(')\"lil{:“-1612,
30 IMIYS \iz\(T:’&'1‘!(‘?E\‘ ‘W’I’l’¥§ P.~='1Y PER Ylirlﬂ. AK!) A SOLID l7()l.?Nl3..¥1'i”i(}N '1'“.-*\'l’ ‘fill? {TAN R{,7H.l) ‘fﬂfflt Lﬂili IEPON.

Reason for rejection: Quite sim-
ply, if you do not talk to strangers,
you will lead a very quiet, boring,
hermit-esque life at college. Every-
one is a stranger to you, but remem-
ber that everyone is a stranger to
everyone. Take this opportunity
to branch out. Talk to people you
wouldn’t normally get to know. Ask
lots of questions. In the ﬁrst couple
weeks of school, it’s not weird at all
to randomly strike up aconversation
with someone sitting next to you in
class or standing beside you in line
for stir—fry. Constantly being on your
toes for potential friends is rough,
but once you break the ice, it’s usu-
ally smooth sailing. I always like to
start off a conversation with a com-
pliment — people will remember
that kind of stuffforever. Or if you
prefer, ask if they did the reading for
class, then bond over how neither of
you actually did.

Lesson number two: “Early to
bed and early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy and wise!” (This
quote is actually from Benjamin
Franklin, but your parents probably
said something along these lines.)

Reason for rejection: Obviously,

 

sleep is essential for everyone on the
planet — especially for those of us
dealing with grueling exams every
few weeks. But some of the most en-
joyable events and friend—mal<ing op— '
portunities happen at night. I’m not
‘necessarily talking about late—night
partying on the weekends, but rather

4/
., .-

 

about run-of—the-mill weekday an-
tics. It’s often difficult to spend time
with your possible friends during
the day because of conﬂicting class
and work schedules, so nighttime is
your best bet for large gatherings of
people — chances are, many of your
ﬂoormates will be awake. Don’t be
afraid to stay up a little later than
usual to plan activities — late night
Sorrento’s, for example. There’s
something about being up late that

   

makes everything seem more mean-
ingful and exciting.

From my experience, the people
who go to bed really early end up
coming off as simply anti-social.
None of this is meant to discourage
you from getting a good night’s rest
—— and of course, any 8 a.m. classes

excuses you for zonking out early
~— but if you can manage it, wait a
little bit and see whatfun is happen-
ing after 11 p.m. You can always nap
tomorrow afternoon.-

Les_son number three: “Don’t do
anything that would make you feel
uncomfortable!”

Reasonfor rejection: College is all
about trying new things you couldn’t
try in high school. If your experience
was similar to mine, your pre-Pitt life

the same_activities at the same place
for four years.

Luckily for you, the amazing city
of Pittsburgh will now be at your ﬁn-
gertips’ —— a luxury you shouldn’t let
go to waste. The Port Authority will
take you to museums, restaurants,
shopping centers and other urban

hotspots you might not have had the .

opportunity to experience during
high school. Regardless of whether
you’re a seasoned city slicker or a
small-town dweller, take some time
away from homework and get out of
your comfort zone.

This advice extends to on-cam-
pus organizations as well. Who cares

if you’ve never picked up a rugby ball ‘

in your life? Try out for the team and
meet some new people. Don’t have
much experience writing but still
think The Pitt News seems like the
greatest establishment on campus (I
mean, don’t ask me, butI think we’re
pretty cool)? Hand in an application
to help with layout or photo.

No one is going to laugh at you if
you don’t know exactly what you’re
doing, no matter what your new
activity is. 5;.-

YOU, there’s an art to putting a‘

“You’ll be spending a lot of V

time in your dorm room, so make
it your own,” said Leah Romay,a
senior and an RA in Holland
Hall.

The University supplies stu-
dents with most of the furniture
they need for their ﬁrst year. The
standard dorm furniture for each

., student is a bed, desk ‘and chair
and a medium-sized dresser. This
means students really only need
essentials like a small fan, an ex-
tra trashcan or storage bins.

They won’t need to bring ex-
tra seating or additional tables
because, honestly, there isn’t re-
ally room for any in most dorm
rooms. Students make do with
what they have, and —— at the
most — bring one or two chairs
that can be easily folded and
stored. Students need additional
storage more than anything else;
Pitt’s provided furniture doesn’t
offer much in that department.

“You need to make sure your
furniture works especially hard
for you,” explained Amy Thump-

ston of Accents by Amy, who re-

cently did a special on KDKA TV‘

on decorating for your dorm.
Thumpston recommended that
students make sure whatever
theybring has as much utility
as possible. If it’s not worth the
space it takes up, do not bring
it. She recommends storage
units that can double as seating,
under-the-bed bins andcloset
organizers.

Laura Martin, a representa-
tive from Bed Bath 8: Beyond says
that many Pitt students in the
past have stocked up on various
organizers and storage pieces,
the most popular being the ones
that fit under beds.

“Under-the-bed storage bins
fit whether your bed is ‘lofted or
not,” she said.

Space will be very limited,
so students have to be inven-
tive to arrange the furniture in
a way that suits them. I’ve seen
roommates who want extra floor
space bunk their beds: others

leave them separate for a little
more personal space. Furniture
arrangements can vary widely, so
be ready to move things around
a few times when you first move
in.

Be ﬂexible throughout the
year — you might end up chang-
ing things later on in the semes-
ter after seeing someone else’s
set-up. 'Just discuss things with
your roommate before every
change, and make sure the Uni-
versity permits it, like putting
nails in your walls.

One of the most important
pieces in your dorm will be your
bedding. Often this is thefirst
item you’ll buy, and it will de-
cide the direction youwant your
decor to take. Temperatures in
the dorm can vary throughout
the year, so I advise. buying a
medium—weight comforter and
bringing some extra blankets.

Bwause people will-‘likely be

eating,the__re _— it’s smart to ﬁnd a

 color, organization keep dorm decor stimulating

bed covering in a darker color.

But be wary of matching ev-
erything to your comforter, as
halfway through the year you
might get sick of it. Mixing and
matching colors and prints will
make your room more interest-
ing and will give you some ﬂex-
ibility if you do change your
mind later. Make sure to buy
extra—long sheets, and bring an
extra set for when you want fresh
sheets but can’t be bothered to
do laundry.

There are many other little
things you can do to make your
room look nice. The lighting in
the dorms can be dim, so one
good idea is bring one or two
extra lamps. Another idea is
to bring a small area rug or ac-

cent pillows to add some color. A

For example, a friend of ‘mine

There are two stereotypes of
college eating: that students are
;-either starving, eating a handful
of popcorn and scanty micro-
Iwave meals to survive or that
hey are gorging themselves on
géries and pizza, overeating in
‘the ‘dining halls.

Must-see movies for college cinephiles 

Patrick Wagner and'Randi Alu
Staff Writers

,§;No matter where you are, there are always
ilovies that you’ve “got to see.” College
4' _ no exception. Some young cinephiles
 ll get to Pitt and realize their ﬁlm-fan-
 friends are talking about movies
5 they’ve never experienced. Now that you’re

  

f pumped up from watching “Animal House” V

1 and “Accepted,” here are a few suggestions
keep your movie-watching classy — and

diverse — at Pitt. Many of these are clas-
, sics, and for movie lovers, must-sees.

- “Fight Club”

Based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk,
“Fight Club” is a popular cult ﬂick. Often
labeled as a guy’s guy movie, because of its
violence, — it is'so mentally stimulating
that the themes transcend the brutality.

As the title suggests, “Fight Club” is
very violent, but it provides a poignant
commentary on modern consumerist
culture;

~ Edward Norton plays the narrator who

"’7§’[§arks the beginning of a club where men

you have locked your keys in the vehicle.

ﬁght each other. The club fosters an odd
but strong bond between the participants,
and develops into somewhat of an individ-
ualistic domestic terrorist group. “Fight
Club” is bothentertaining and thought-
provoking, and Brad Pitt and Norton —.—-
not to mention supporting female char-
acter Marla, played by Helena Bonham
Carter —— are consistently awesome.

“The Empire Strikes Back”

Before Ralph Wiggum “bent his Wook-
ie” on “The Simpsons,” “Star Wars” was al-
ready a cultural phenomenon that reached
its artistic pinnacle with the second — or
fifth — chronological tale of Luke Sky-
walker and company in their struggle
against the Galactic Empire.

If you didn’t know that a certain some-
one is actually someone else’s father, col-
lege is the time to have your mindpblown by
the ultimate twist'ending.4With elements,
of comedy, drama, war, sci—ﬁ, romance
and just pure epicness, it’s a classic that’s
worth seeingjust so you can remember all
the cultural references.

It’s a must-see, young Padawan, wheth-
er you believe in the Force or not.

Bride.” '

This ﬁlm comes from a not-so-long-
ago time when being labeled “romantic
comedy” wasn’t an insult — thanks for
ruining that, Hugh Grant.

Hysterically funny with a touch of ador-
able, it won’t make you feel awkward when
watching with a big group of guys. It’s a
love story, but action and. hilarity take
the wheel. And despite a title that might
turn some guys off it, it’s not sickeningly
sweet.

This is a college essential because many
can recite the lines as it plays. And if you
haven’t seen it? Inconceivable!

“The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”

, Beyond the distinctive theme and Clint .

Eastwood’s simply badass role as the for-
tune hunter Blondie, “The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly” is a manual in what makes
Westerns so fun. '

When three gunslingers — who offer

Bet. er lug

their attributes to the title —- get word

of buried Confederate gold in Union-
occupied Texas, they race for it and end
faced with a three-way duel to decide the
victor. It’s not just “cowboys and Indians,
but a powerful thriller built on a rawhide
frame.

With Westerns on the rise again, Ser-
gio Leone’s classic remains a springboard
for anyone interested in getting her man-
movie on.

“Pan’s Labyrinth”

Not for the faint of heart or the squea-
mish, “Pan’s Labyrinth” is an Oscar-win-
ning masterpiece written and directed 1
by Guillermo del Tom, who hails from“”
Mexico.

This ﬁlm deﬁes genres. It’s a genius

‘blend of historical war drama, fairytale

fantasy, mind-bending psychological com-
mentary  the list goes on. It has some-
thing for everyone. The story follows a
young girl in 1944 Spain as she tries to

Ghosts lurk in local landmarks’ lore 

Several locations in Pittsburgh host stories of phantoms, but some of these legends might not be rooted in fact.

urgh. It’s large enough to keep people on
eir toes but small enough that it’s almost
: ozy. Maybe even cozy enough for the dead
toverstay their welcome.
{Whether their tellers believe in ghosts
. I; not, ghost stories in Pittsburgh are ev-
“ : rywhere — individual neighborhoods
soften have enough ghost stories for spooky
tours in just one district. Oakland and Pitt’s
campus have their fair share of -spooky
tales,“ too. But there are questions about
‘how much historical truth can be found
in these stories. Are they based on true
events, or were theyjust made up to make
‘freshmen shiver in their beds?
, There might just have been a little of

here’s a lot to appreciate about Pitts-

But this doesn’t stop some locals from
believing the stories, as each has become
ingrained into Pittsburgh culture and rep-
resents a part of the city’s history.

The Pittsburgh,Playhouse

More than 100 years old, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse is a performing arts center for
Point Park University and its Conserva-
tory of Performing Arts. But it’s associated

with more than good theater, according to '

Michelle Smith. She is the co-founder of
Haunted Pittsburgh, a storytelling orga-
nization that collects ghost stories to tell
to the public and does research into the
stories to see how much of the history in
the tales is actually true.

“This is one of the most-known alleg-
edly haunted places,” Smith said. “People
just associate it with hauntings in Pitts-
burgh.” ,

The story goes that at one time the Play-
house at various times hosted a restaurant,

...A1'ts courses can broaden education

"Qt-iv

Emma Kilcup
Staﬁ" Writer

‘Students might ultimately choose to major
in something their parents consider, practi-
cal — but that doesn’t mean their course load
can’t include a few interesting arts "courses
along the way.

With courses like Afro Caribbean Dance and
Medieval Imagination, 15itt’s course catalogue
provides opportunities for students to pursue
an array of interests. Perhaps these courses
might not be directly applicable to a finance
degree, but according to some professors, they
provide valuable lessons all the same and many
may count toward General Education Require-

ments and Humanities majors.

“College is not only a place for pre—profes—
sional training, but should be a way for people

to think about problems and articulate them,” '

said. Renate Kosinski, professor and chair of
Pitt’s French and Italian department.
Kosinski has taught undergraduate courses
ranging from Love, Sex and Marriage in the
Middle Ages to Women’s Voices in French
Literature. Although both classes exemplify
her focus on speciﬁc eras and topics, Kosinski
explains that the classes connect to modern

times.
“We look at issues that are relevant today
— how women become professional and make
themselves heard,” Kosinski said. “It’s exn'eme— -
ly interesting that women in the Renaissance
wrote poems exactly about this problem. I’ve
chosen certain conflicts between domestic
andprofessional life and I want to show what
these offer.” ’
Kosinski explains that the course is not
just for students pursuing French or Women’s
studies. ' ‘ T
In the Modern French Novel class she taught
during the spring of 2011, Kosinski wrote rec-
ommendations for a Neuroscience major as
well as a nursing student. She explains that they
learned how to analyze text, which is helpful in
many disciplines. The course description for
Modern French Novel encompasses ‘the ﬂex-
ibility of the course material, explaining the

importance of the novels in world literature as l
‘ well breaking down the structure of a novel.

But France isn’t the only country Pitt stu-
dents can encounter through the liberal arts
class catalogue.

Neepa Majumdar, a professor of English at
Pitt, has noticed that a wide range of students
take and enjoy her Bollywood and Indian Cin-
ema course. .

“Inthe past, the ones who were Bollywood
fans were almost always students of Indian or
South Asian heritage. Now this has changed,
and a lot of non-Indian students who take the
course are simply there because they are fans,”

. Majumdar said. -

Majumdar’s course traces the origins of
Bollywood as well as its inﬂuence beyond India

a and into the United States, the United Kingdom

and Africa. _ _
Renate Kosinski:

College is not

only a place for
pre -professional
training.

“My goal is to provide students with a
broader look at the larger span on Indian cin-
ema history, and to understand Bollywood as
a small fraction of that larger cinematic tradi-
tion,” Majumdar said. ’ —

With such a speciﬁc focus, Majumdar is able

to delve into topics like gender and religion in
order to fully analyze the movement of Bol-

lywood cinema.

Both Kosinski and Majumdar acknowledge
the importance of expanding the minds of stu-
dents beyond the required courses and certain
studies, and students learn to take chances on
these types of courses. .

Rocco Ditalia, a sophomore studying Neu-
roscience and Film, took the course Introduc-
tion To World Music in the fall of 2010. The
course introduces various types of music from
many different places and is another example

of a course with a particular focus that spans V

many areas.

“I thinkthe most intriguing partwas learn- a

ing how nations all have different scales"and
time meters for their music, and ‘ﬁguring? out
where each of the countries had history and
why their music came to be the way it did,”
Ditalia said.

Though Ditalia is not pursuing a degree in

music, the class offered insight into different ‘

cultures and history as well. Along with the
scales and time meters,.the course examines
the political, economic, social and religious
aspects of music. .
“I’d recommend it as really eye-opening to
the size of the world, and realizing that cultures
are way more different from one another than
previously assumed,” Ditalia said. I

John Johns’ obituary contrary to ghost story

Ghosts 4 81

church, bar and brothel ~— and it saw a lot
of gruesome events,“Smith said.

, Supposedly, the actor John Johns'col—
lapsed from a heart attack in the theater
restaurant in the 1960s. He was taken to
dressing room seven and died waiting for
the ambulance. People began to report
footsteps going to the dressing room —
one woman even saw a man sitting by him-
self. She later identiﬁed him from photos
as John Johns.

johns’ ghost supposedly has company in
the form of the Lady in White. According to
the stories from Haunted Pittsburgh, the
Lady was married in the church that used
to exist in the theater. Depending on which

version is told‘, she either found her hus— .-

bE%(I)ld having an affair with a woman in the
bg thel or with an actress at the theater.
She shot both. Then, depending again on
the story, she either jumped to her death
from a balcony or shot herself,

,7 “Supposedly, she has been seen walk-
ing though the air where the balcony once
\§(as,” Smith said. “The balcony isn’t there
a:nymore.” '

 And those two don’t even account for
half of the possible ghostly residents of
the theater. Some people hear the crying
of Weeping Eleanor, the victim of a ﬁre in
row houses behind the theater. The ugly,
decaying face of the ironically named Gor-
geous George is sometimes seen when he
taps on windows around the theater. And
one account from the 1970s tells the tale of
the Bouncing Red Meanie, who appeared
before students performing a seance.

“After a few minutes, the [students] saw
Ii man in red with a worried expression
pacing back and forth,” Smith said. “He
actually lifted off the ground and began
bouncing off the walls.”

The entire theater then ﬁlled with peo-
ple wearing period clothing. After that, the
students taking part in the seance left the
theater fast. A

b All of these are pretty cool stories to

terrify roommates with —— but how much .

of the history behind them is true?

The history is there, but some facts
have been changed over time because of
the way the stories work, according to
Thomas White, university archivist and
curator of special collections at Duquesne
University, who published several ghost
story books after doing research into
spooky tales around parts of the city.

"P For example, Johnjohns really did die

 a heart attack '— at a completely dif- ‘
ferent restaurant nowhere near dressing -

room seven, according to his obituary.
Smith even has a link to Johns’ scanned
obituary.

“I think that over time, someone tells ’

his story and that he died, and that over
time they began to say he died in the build-

v v 1

ing,” White said. “Certain details make it

a better story’ over time.”

One reason many ghost storiespersist

is that a lot of the history behind the sto-
ries will never be known and the mystery
leaves room for speculation, White said.
For example, no one has ever documented
the existence of a brothel at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse — and no one documented the
death of the woman who supposedly be-

came a crying spirit.

“It is almost impossible to conﬁrm any
brothels in‘ Pittsburgh,” White said. “But
there have certainly been many changes in
that building. There was also most prob-
ably a ﬁre, but I haven’t'be‘en able to con-
ﬁrm that a girl died.” .

The Lady in White is a challenging fig-
ure, as well — between multiple stories
and no name, it’s almost impossible to ﬁnd

information on the mysterious woman.
Author Beth Trapani writes in “Ghost Sto-
ries of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County”
that the shooting took place in the 1930?,
~ but White has never found anything in his
research to conﬁrm this. Trapani could
not be contacted for this story.
There’s no way to link Gorgeous George

to any historical ﬁgures. As for the last
tale, although hedoubted the story for
ears, White met one of the students who
saw the Bouncing Red Meanie less than
one year ago, conﬁrming that a group of
students held a seance in the building and
that they believe they experienced some-
thing paranormal.
Representatives from the Pittsburgh
Playhouse declined to comment on the
stories and reports.

Bruce Hall ’

Some ghost stories are closer to"home
7- literally, for the students living in Bruce
lilall.

Bruce Hall was originally part of the
historic Schenley Apartments, according
to Smith of ‘I-Iaunted Pittsburgh. The ghost .
stories here focus not on the dorms them-
selves, but on Room 1201, which caters to
dinners and receptions.

“It’s not clear whether it’s haunted by
one or two ghosts,” Smith said about Room
1201.

planned for this fall as_ well. The hour-long
classes take place twice a week and run
,-for twelve weeks. .

 “Most people will take them with a

-least one friend, so it’s a great way to
be with your friendsiand also do some-
thing active — but then there are a lot
of people looking forward to getting in
shape,” Malekoff said. i .
 The cost is $3oito register, but there
are no credits involved.
“Because you pay for these classes,

fﬁliort, one-hour workout that’s enjoy-
able,” Malekoff said. ’

T She added that the instructors are pro-
fessionals from all around Pittsburgh,
another benefit to taking the classes.

“The advantage of choosing this over
just working out in the gym is that you’re
working with someone who’s been trained
in doing this, so’ you know you’re getting
a real workout,” Malekoff said.

i Information about these classes will be
available in September, and students can

_ sign up at the ticket ofﬁce in the William
p Pitt Union. ~

Pitt classes are also offered for one
credit. under the Physical Education
(PEDC) subject area on the Pitt Course
Descriptions website. These range from
water ‘aerobics to pilates to golf under
four main categories ‘— aquatics, dance,
general fitness and group exercises.

“In an aerobics or a boot-camp class,

if ‘ - people see a lot of improvement in car-

diovascular ﬁtness, while pilates and yoga
are more for muscular endurance, so it
all depends on what the student wants,”
Laura Fonzi said. Fonzi is a supervisor
of about 30 of these classes each semes-
ter.

The classes are located in three studios
on campus in Trees Hall, the Petersen

_ Events Center and Belleﬁeld Hall, with

the aquatics and dance classes mainly
located in Trees Hall.‘ The credit for the
class is gained byattendance and partici-

‘ pation, not the quality of performance in

the exercises. .
‘‘You’ll get specifically designed work-

‘ outs. I encourage my instructors to be

open to whatever the students want to do.

of a stepfather for a fantasy world.

Watching it with a group of friends
will spark endless discussion about the
symbolism and the ending. And on a su-
perﬁcial level, it’ll make you look smart.
“Oh, you’re knowledgeable about foreign
ﬁlms? How sexy.”

“Monty Python and the }~Ioly Grail” 3

Not only did comedy troupe Monty Py-
thon produce notables such as actorjohn
Cleese and “Fear and Loathing in Las Ve-
gas” director Terry Gilliam, it also deﬁned
British humor to foreign audiences with
zany characters, surreal situations and
something close to observational humor.

Horses are simulated by pages with co— ‘

conut shells, and Camelot is infested with
an intolerable group of singing knights —
even Arthur doesn’t want to go, these are
some of the many instantly memorable
moments. There’s the Black Knight who
won’t give up',— “It’s only a ﬂesh wound!”
— and a bridgekeeper who doesn’t know
whether_the unladen swallow is African
or European.

While not everyone will “get it,” the re-
interpretation of King Arthur’s legendary
quest for the Holy Grail will have most in
stitches. It can act as an important primer
for humor outside —— and inside — the
comedic movies of today.

“Singin’ in the Rain”

Hailing from a time where a man could
shamelessly tap dance, “Singin’ in the
Rain” is a Technicolor bundle of fun. The
ﬁlm combines a picture-perfect love story
and humor to create a timeless classic.

The score is infectious —— singing along
is common, and you will be humming it in
the shower days later. Many other films
have been influenced by “Singin’ in the
Rain,” so it’s great to know the roots. The

- 1952 moviemakers used pre-existing songs

in the score, writing the script around
them. 2o01’s “Moulin Rouge!” took note,

employing the same method.

Plus, it’s Gene Kelly -— quintessen-
tial ’50s heartthrob and Pitt legend. Who
wouldn’t want to imagine “backseat bingo”
with that dreamboat? Eszl

the Carnegie Library of Homestead has been

health and education, and the 1,000-plus-seat

Melodie Schooley from Arrangements

pany, recommends keeping your room

organized. Because dorms are smaller

than the average living space, they look
messy much more easily.
“Organize your closet,” Schooley said.

, “The more things you can stuff in your

closet, the better. Bed Bath & Beyond has a
lot of closet organizers that do not get per-
manently installed. You can add alsecond
rod and double your shirt/pant hanging

of organization in a college student’s dorm
after seeing ﬁrsthand some of the mis-
takes‘ first—year students make. .

“Keeping an organized dorm room
helps ‘reduce your stress, so you know
where everything is and don’t lose some-
thing important. Because college makes
you always on the go, it’s really convenient
to have things in an easy-to-re'ach place so
you can grab them and go,” she said.

Of course, you should remember to

. Adhesive hooks handy for displaying wall art

thing from posters and pictures to cal-
endars can add a pop of interest. Look
around for inexpensive posters,as they
tend to be damaged once you try to take
them down. The same goes for photo-
graphs. One idea is to make a collage of
your favorite photos —- but be sure to leave
room for new ones. .

“Posters are a classic way to decorate
the walls and can easily be mounted with
poster foam tape. Hanging things from the
ceiling looks pretty too, like tissue—paper ‘
pom—poms, giant snowﬂakes or paper
ﬂowers. You could string lights around
your room or hang them from the ceiling

- using Command hooks,” Romay said.

But make sure to check with your room-
mate before hanging anything big, such as
decorative lights, around your room. My
roommate freshman year hung up lights
that, while cool during the evening, drove
me crazy while I was trying to sleep. You
and your roommate might have differ-
ing tastes, and while sometimes you can
coordinate and mesh those, sometimes
you’ll have to just be happy with keeping
your style to your half. A‘

It’s the small things in your room that
will make it interesting. Places like Urban
Outfitters and Ikea often sell smaller items ’
that fit nicely on dressers and‘ desks, but
don’t take up too much of your space.

Think outside the box, too. Things like
pretty cards, old record covers, even used
maps make interesting decor. One of my
favorite pieces in my room is a framed map

Take advantage of ﬂea markets and
garage sales this summer. Look for things
like small, pretty dishes or cool vintage
posters to make your room look great
while not spending too much. I bought
a set of blue and white china for.$3, and
have used the dishes for everything from
eating to storing jewelry and schools sup-
plies on my desk.

Finally, one of the best things to do
to get ideas -for how to personalize your
dorm is to look online. Design websites
like Desi_gn*Sponge and Apartment Ther-
apy are great outlets for creative ideas,.
but even stores like Ikea, Bed Bath 8: Be-
yond and Target have helpful sites for
students.

1. policies regarding the room.

 The Cathedral of Learning

People in the Cathedral of Learning

 have no problem sharing ghost stories —
i stories that are close to the "Nationality
 Rooms director’s heart.

, ..,.:;,.AThe Early American Room in the Ca-
7 thedral is dark, always locked and down-
: étight spooky. Over the years, reports have

come in about janitorswho would clean
'the:room’s loft and make the bed, only to
turn around and ﬁnd it unmade and with
an, imprint of a head on the pillow.‘The
isiifadle has been seen rocking. The smell of
..baking bread has wafted into the room. A
TV crew was locked inside when the door

slammed on them once — the room has _

no draft. .

For years, no one wanted to admit they
were experiencing things. ‘Now, every Hal-
loween, a woman who might be related
tovthe room’s spiritual inhabitant takes
people into the room and gives a tour.

A E. Maxine Bruhns works as the Nation-
ality Rooms director and has been at the

.-L-_Jn,iversity since 1965. She believes the _ .

ghost who hauntsthe room is Martha Poe,

her grandmother. Poe died in Bruhns’ own '
bed in the 1930s when Bruhns was only .

eight or nine years old.
:;‘5I can’t reproduce it,” she said about

aﬁlle events inside the room, meaning she .
;S>an’t ﬁnd a natural cause for the phenom— '

enon.

Bruhns believes Poe has stayed in the
room because of the quilt on the bed.
Bruhns’ mother donated the quilt years
ago. It was Poe’s wedding quilt, made by
the grandmother herself.

“There’s things in that room that be-
longed to her,” Bruhns said. “I’m here. It’s
a good familiar place to her.”

“Things are still going on,”. Bruhns said,
adding that she’s seen people startled in

the Early American Room who “aren’t eas-

ily startled.”
Theroom can only be seen on tours
' given by Cathedral staff. Otherwise it’s

‘kept locked so that nothing inside goes .

missing. But Bruhns is more than happy
to talk to anyone about the events in the
room.

“The stories make people love that
room. It makes it a favorite on tours,”
she said.

seminars that taught them to make food
with simple recipes, giving them more
options for their diets.

“The key to eating well while at the
University is ‘planning your meals ahead
of..time’ and ‘taking time to enjoy a meal
that’s healthy,”’ Miller said.

Kathy Zatavekas, the outpatient di-
etician coordinator at UPMC Presbyte-
rian and UPMC Shadyside, agrees that
students -should strive to eat healthily
while at Pitt. She suggests students uti-

  

lize mypyramid.gov, a website that pro-
vides an explanatory guide to improving
one’s health.

When new students first attend the

‘University,-there will be an array of food

options that differ from what they had
at home. It is important for students to
recognize what is best for them in their
new environment, Zatavekas said.

“Some choices might not be the cor-
rect ones for yourhealth,” Zatavekas
said. V

The food a person eats throughout the A

day has a direct effect on-performance,
she said. She said studies show that stu-
dents who eat their first meal of the day
are more alert and successful in class.

“Performance is based on nutrition.
It affects the mental status as well as
physical,” Zatavekas said.

A balanced breakfast — consisting of
more than just a piece of fruit — gives
students the nutrients to be prepared
for the day. Fresh fruit, yogurt and a

But how do, students learn creative
and healthy recipes? Chef Odette Smith-
Ransome, the lead culinary instructor at
the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, offered
a few suggestions for students looking
to spice up their daily menus.

Staples such as yogurt, nuts and grai-
nola are all important foods to keep,
Smith-Ransome said. These three ingre-
dients can even be combined to produce
a satisfying meal. ' ‘-

Gazpacho, a cold soupthat incorpo-
rates tomatoes, is easily made with the
help of a blender, she said. Served with
sour cream and bread, this meal idea
provides students with a nutritious op-
tion that can be adjusted according to
taste. . ‘1
Smith-Ransome also suggested ‘a

Kathy Zatavekas:

Some choices 
might not be the
correct ones for 

, your health.

Sweat Pea Pesto Dip that students can
make in a blender and eat as a dip or
pour over pasta. _, ' i
s “This will have some nutrition for
[students] as well as be enjoyable. It’s
more substantial,” Smith-Ransome
said. - .
With a blender, students can make
the ever-popular smoothie, even though
the residence halls do not have ice int’-
mediately accessible. Frozen fruitvcan
replace the ice and blend with fruit juice
and yogurt to make an appetizing snack
with a lot of nutrients. 5 
Edamame —— soybeans — and fresh
pea pods are two other nutritious snacks
Smith-Ransome suggests. Students can

V consume the vegetables raw'or slightly

heated in their microwaves,.and even
tossed with soy or teriyaki sauce, she
said“ ’ ‘

edge of food is to change the ingredients
in a favorite recipe, the chef said.

“If you have something that you like,
then you can just play with it,” Smith-

All the experts agree that it is most
important that students attempt to make
new foods that add nutritional valu"e‘to
their diets while providing a tasty snac

or mealiduring their day. _ _~ r  .

._out, pee on his door or however it is you plan
to get back at him — think really hard. This

person might have an intolerable personality, »

they might have even said your new haircutwas
ugly, but they’re not worth wasting your time.
When you seek retribution, you’re only making
yourselflook bad.
I dislike plenty of people — my friend’s trashy
roommate and that kid who asks 50 questions in

ack at them.

A .a?;oo-person lecture —-butI don’t dislike them

actively. That is, I won’t make snide comments
intheir presence, butl also won’t invite them to
any parties I’m hosting.
And here’s the kicker: If they’re really as bad
as you think, the world will do a pretty good
job getting back at them. The trashy roommate
who never took care of her friends doesn’t have
too many friends to neglect anymore, for in-
stance. _ V
Still, it’s been a few years since I was a fresh-
man, so I decided to ask the advice of a friend
who just ﬁnished -out her freshman year. She
gtransferred schools after her ﬁrst semester, so
.she gottwo chances to experience the freshman
jitters — lucky, lucky, right?

A She pretty much tanked her social life during
her ﬁrst semester: An episode in which she lay
gnawing on a chocolate bar inthe fetal position
near my desk epitomized her social life’s decline.
Because she initially judged whole groups of
people based on their activities, she made few
friends, and she was miserable. During her sec-

ond semesteratanewcollegeinanewstate, she -

Signed up for just about everything —- youth
group, airsofc, etc. Although she quickly aban-
doned many of those activities, she made friends
.she’s still hanging out with.

e  So the main point is that, much like clothes

‘and activities, when it comes to people, you -

should give them all a shot and then pare down
your choices gradually. Don't just write people
off immediately. But if you do get to know them

~ and they’re as awful as you thought — forget
’em. I

Such proclivities can make success and
satisfaction agonizingly difficult to at-
tain.

Coming to college, I remember my
strongest hope for the new environment
being that I might leave the omnipres-
ent weight of shyness behind. Although
I had made the same resolution time and
again in the past, I quieted my negative
internal dialogue and decided, for what
I hoped would be the ﬁnal time, that this
experience would be different. And if you

are someone who considers yourself shy,
you should do the same.

According to Psychology Today, the
negative, effects of shyness are due to the
characteristic’s three main contributing
factors: excessive self-consciousness, ex-
cessive negative self-evaluation and exces-
sive negative self-preoccupation. Although

being aware of these root causes won’t'

cure shyness or erase its inhibitions, it can
help reinforce a crucial realization: If you

can be comfortable and happy with who

you are, the people around you will follow

suit. And if not all of them do, who cares?
You’ll know what matters to you.

Of course, attaining self—conﬁdence
and releasing oneself from binding res-
ervation is a monumental task. “Just be
yourself !” is never as simple as it seems.
Keep in mind that you’re worth represent-
ing yourself candidly. It might be difficult,
but what’s important is to keep trying, and
to want to keep trying. Being a wallﬂower
is not all that it’s cracked up to be. I

Basketball, football tickets accessible to students

Kelly Flanigan

Staff Writer i

The tune of “Sweet Caroline”
begins playing in Heinz Field.
;Pitt students stand and wrap
their arms around each others’
shoulders, belting out the fa-
miliar words and adding in the
occasional “Let’s go Pitt!” when
appropriate.

. At a basketball game, the mem-
bers of Pitt’s student section, the
Oakland Zoo, throw up their
crinkled newspapers and begin
bouncing up and down, yelling

continuously as the lights dim and

;Pitt’s starters are introduced.
But while these traditionsare

second nature to those students.

currently on campus, students
arriving at Pitt don’t even know
where to begin. With football sea-
son fast approaching, new stu-
dents might wonder how they can
obtain tickets to watch the newly

hired head coach Todd Graham’s
“high octane” offense, likely to
be led by Tino Sunseri at quar-
terback and Ray Graham at run-
ning back. '
When basketball season be-
gins in November, new students
might want to consider just how
difﬁcult it is to join the Oakland
Zoo and how they can grab the
front row seats right behind the

- ESPN cameras.

Luckily for new arrivals, se-
curing tickets for football and
basketball games isn’t as difficult
as it might seem — even though
snatching the best available might
require spending a few hours
waiting in line. .

The 2011 football season fea-
tures eight home games at Heinz
Field: Buffalo, Maine, Notre Dame,
South Florida, Utah, Connecticut,
Cincinnati and Syracuse..

“The excitement and momen-
tum for Pitt football under ﬁrst—
year Head Coach Todd Graham

continues to be outstanding, and
season tickets for the 2011 season
continue to sell at a record pace,”
Pitt Associate Athletic Director
Chris Ferris said.

An hour before a February tip—off
bﬁween Pitt and West Virginia at
the Petersen Events Center, a Pitt
student dressed in a gold shirt, navy
gym shorts, white tube socks and a

headband stoodbehindarow of court—’

side seats. He watched West Virginia’s
warm-ups intently. P

He paradeda mock-up of]oe Maz-
zulla’s mug shot and shouted Maz-
zulla’s name in an attempt to taunt
him. Much to his surprise, the West
Virginia guard came over, signed the
mug shot and resumes his warrn—up
Bflfhwalked away with agrin. A

Three minutes into Lin: game, Maz-
zulla headed to the free—throw line.
One student behind the rim danced
in a neon-pink Windbreaker: The rest
of the section raised its arms to the
left and swings themto the rightwhen
he attempts his shot, except for a few

' stragglers that made the motion in the '

opposite direction.
“Wait, are we going leﬁ to right or
right to left?’ one student asked. '

known for being one of the loudest,
most creative and most intimidating
inthe nation. _

“Come game time, it’s 40 minutes
of intensity,” former Zoo president
David Jedlicka said. “You’re not go-
ing to ﬁnd too many other basketball
venues outside of Pitt and afew other
top schools that are going to cheer
from the tip of the ball until the ﬁnal
buzzer sounds.” .

Jedlicka, who since graduated, was

Some students dress in animal cos-

_ tumes. Others bring giant cardboard

cutouts of the faces of the players and

Pitt students, the wardrobe is simple:

“When you put that shirt on, you
are truly a part of something,” said
upcoming senior_].D. Schroeder, one
ofnextseason’s Zoo leaders. “Formost
games, ofthe 1,500 kids inthe student
section, maybe20 are notwearingzoo

The group started in early 2001
when Pitt students Matt Cohen and

friends to form what they dubbed the

T—shirts and grew exponentially, even- ’

tually moving with the team into the
Petersen Events Center in 2002 and
becoming an official University stu-
dent group in the same year.

Today, ifs one of the largest stu-
dent groups at Pitt.

The Zoo begins behind the rim by
the home bench, wraps along one side-
line and continues with one section
along the baseline near the visitor’s
bench, encompassing nearly three
ﬁill sides of the court. Pitt’s pep band
resides within the Zoo in the comer
nextto the player entrance, and there’s

T also a standing-room balcony and an

overﬂow section inthe upper level that
ﬁlls during conference play.

“You are right on top of the action
the whole time,” Schroeder said. “It’s

5 Pittsburgh Steelers

The Pittsburgh Steelers are perhaps the most
popular teaminAmerica. Across the country you
will ﬁnd parts of the Steeler Nation in the form
ofjerseys, sports bars and tattoos. ’
I “There are a lot of people who leave Pitts-

-,;I_§'port,” Rucksaid. “They mightbe 20 or30 years
i W” moved from Pittsburgh, but they keep identi-
 " gthrough the Steelers.” S
 ;Yet — with. six Super Bowl titles under its
belt—- the most accomplished team of the Super
Bowl Era has its share of haters as well.

“I hate the Steelers,” said Chrisﬁan Fagan, a

 
   

obnoxious, and they employ several cheap—shot
artists on their team. I’m really glad the Packers
beat them because I don’tthinkI could take the
gloating from Steelers fans for another year.”

In Super Bowl XLVthis pastjanuaryetheir
eighth championship game —- the Steelers at-
tempted to be the ﬁrst team to win seven titles.
The game came only two years after the Steel-
ers had become the ﬁrst and only team to win
their sixth.

Troy Polamalu and James Harrison led a
vaunted and bone—crushing defense —;— a Steel—
ers’ signature since the 1970s —— alongside a
balanced offense led by embattled quarterback
Ben Roethlisberger.

The team won the AFC North division this
past year and then dispatched the Baltimore
Ravens and New York Jets to reach the Super
Bowl, where the Green Bay Packers defeated
them 31-25. '

After the Steelers ultimately fell short of their
championship goal, fans turned to the second-

most popular team in the city, the Pittsburgh 

Penguins. A

Pittsburgh Penguins

Aftera spell of terrible play inthe late—1990s
and early—20o0s, the Pittsburgh Penguins hit
the lottery interms of draft picks. '

In 2005, the Penguins chose Sidney Crosby
with the ﬁrst overall pick. Once Crosby took the
ice with other young stars the likes of Evgeni
Malkin,_]ordan Staal and Marc—André Fleury —
all of whom were acquired over the next several
seasons — the Penguins rose from the abyss of
the hockey world and turned into one of its most
consistent winners.

I This rise to prominence reached a new height
in2009 when the Penguins defeated the Detroit
Red Wings — who had beaten them the year
before inthe ﬁnals —— in athrilling, seven—game
Stanley Cup Final. ..

iii.» sports offer competit

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

While Pitt’s scholarship" and varsity players hog
tire headlines each year, they aren’t the only
student—athletes on campus. For some, the
love of sport and team outside of the "spotlight
drives them towards hours of commitment
each week. i
From Ultimate Frisbee to club tennis, Pitt
has hundreds of club athletes on campus. The
University currently has 26 teams with club
status. '
Some of the sports, such as softball, base-
ball and soccer, are also offered at the varsity
level. Others are only offered at the club level,
such as water polo and lacrosse.
.5‘ A step above intramural sports, in which
students play against athletes from their own
school, club sports offers competition against
teams from other universities. The teams are
a part of the Student Organization Resource
Center. SORC, certiﬁes all types of student
organizations to operate on campus and pro-
vides information, resources, services and
training. , .

* Students get their ﬁrst chance to get in-
volved with these sports at the Student Ac-
tivities Fair each fall. This fair, which usually
tikes place in and around Posvar Hall, consists

of hundreds of tables and sign-up sheets for
various clubs from all over campus.

Scott Bronder, who plays for the club ten-
nis team at Pitt, said the sign-up sheets at the
activities fair give students an opportunity to
try out.0nce a student signs up, they get an op-
portunity to spend some time with the team.

“We then travel to Monroeville where we
hold practices indoors at the Club 4 Life tennis
courts,” Bronder said.

Many players on the tennis team have high
school varsity experience and are still growing
as players.

“We like to consider ourselves another skill
level above the varsity level in high school,”

Bronder said. “Members have considerable‘

skill that is above that of a novice or even in-
termediate player.”

For some sports, such as Ultimate Fris-
bee, the competitive nature of the team is not
hinderedby the fact that the athletes play a
lesser—known sport. ‘

“The team is extremely competitive,” junior
captain of the men’s team Colin Conner said.
“Each year we are trying to be the best team
in the country.” . ’ '

Last year, the team ﬁnished third at nation-
als in Madison, Wis.

“We usually will ﬂy to one or two touma—
ments a year,” Conner said. “We’ve gone to

' California and Texas in'the past. We usually end

up traveling to about two tournaments during
the fall and six tournaments in the spring.” f

Like the men’s Ultimate team, the men’s la-
crosse club at Pitt is also highly competitive.

Chris Gorham, who is the captain and
goalie for the team, says the team’s tryouts
are usually about ﬁnding the most dedicated
players.

“It’s not just screwing around playing la-
crosse,” Gorham said. “We actually compete
and try to win. It’s more of a weeding out pro-
cess to ﬁgure out who isn’t willing to practice
hard and come to all the events.” -

This May, the team’s season ended after
a loss to Michigan State in conference semi-
ﬁnals. In club lacrosse, teams can play in Divi-
sion 1, 2, or 3 conferences. As a Division I,club

team, the Pitt team has a big travel year. Ih the -

past, the team has been to Florida, Kentucky,
Ohio and Michigan.
Gorham said one of the most special things

V about the team is its bond.
“It’s more of a family than a team,”_Gorham '

said. “Guys coming out to the team should
know that it’s a close-knit team, and we take
pride in that. They’re not just my-teammates,
they’re my brothers, and I count on them for
everything.”

There are plenty of opportunities in wom-

T en’s sports, as well, including a women’s Ulti-

mate team. Students looking‘ for a different

ion, friendship 

type of challenge might considerthe women’s

‘ water polo team.

Lisa Czerniewski, now a senior and the
team’s business manager, heard aboutthe team
through the activities fair her freshman year.

“I actually played in high school so I was re-
ally excited when I heard about it,” Czerniewski
said.

’ The team, which practices three times a
week in the spring and lifts before each prac; .
tice, tries to balance competition with ﬁm.

“We play to win,” Czerniewski said. “We’re
trying to have ﬁm, but we’re not going to put
aside the competitive nature.” ' ‘R

The team is serious enough that some
rivalries have emerged over the years, and
Czerniewski was quick to point to another
nearby school when considering Pitt’s big-
gest rivals. ‘

“Our biggest rival is Penn State, we really

don’t like" each other,” Czerniewski said with .

a laugh.

Czerniewski says some people underes-
timate the strength it takes to play some of
these sports. ;

“When we practice, people aren’t allowed
to touch the bottom because during a game,
you’ll be penalized for touching the bottom,”
Czerniewski said-. “If we ask the girls to tread
water for three hours at practice, they’re ex-3
pected to do that.” I '

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Think of your average inspirational sports
movie.

A ragtag bunch of athletes suffers blowout

after blowout, only to pull it together at the last
possible moment. Thanks to an inspirational
speech, a cunning tactic or a ringer that just
sdhappens to be the neighborhood bully, the
scrappy protagonists win the championship
against all odds. V
The Pitt Panthers are abou : the opposite
of that. e _
. Things start off great, and then — WHAM!
 a tragic ending of Shakespearean propor-
tions sends Panther fans home distraught and
droopy-eyed. E
; 1‘ If you don’t believe me, take a look at Pitt
basketball, a program that has been nearly
unbeatable early in the season. Seriously,
the class of 2012 seniors have losttwice at
home. '

“In the Big East Tournament in March, with
the game tied, the clock winding down and
(let’s assume) billions watching, an unfortu-

nate switch forced Gary McGhee to defend

.UConn’s star guard Kembawalker one—on-one.
You can guess how thatone worked out.

Inthe third round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, a calamitous foul three miles away from
the rim gift-wrapped Butler awin just after Pitt
miraculously tied the game.

Those two heartbreaks came ninedays
apart. ' ’

Pitt football has a similar story to tell, just
with more coaching changes. Two years ago,
Pitt played Cincinnati in a de facto Big East
Championship game. The Panthers led by 21,
but Cincinnati came back to tie it with about
nine minutes remaining in the fourth quar-
ter.. The Panthers scored a late touchdown to
break the tie, but they botched the extra point
and saw the Bearcats drive for a last-minute
winning score.

Last-year, Pitt was the most talented team
in an awful conference. The Associated Press
called the Panthers “the undisputed favorite to
win the Big East and advance to a BCS bow ”

A after they started the conference schedule
3-0. _Not to jinx it or anything.

That shoo-in BCS" bid began to slip away
late in the seasonwith atwo-pointlossat Con-
necticut. After a crushing 35-10 blowout at

' home against rival West Virginia on the day r

after Thanksgiving, it was gone.

T 4 ‘Now that you’re at Pitt, you’re going to ex-

perience this kind of pain. It’s the kind of pain
' Y 011 -feel when you change your Thanksgiving

plans in order to stand in the cold to watch

football, only to see your team lose by 25 points

. in the biggest game of the year. Speaking meta-

phorically of course.

Oh! I forgot to mention Scottie Reynolds!
I’ll save that story for another day.

Plenty of incoming students don’t buy into
Pitt sports from day one — feel free to glower

' 4 at the kid on your ﬂoor that clings to his older

brother’s Penn State hat —— but eventually,
you’ll call yourself a Pitt fan and not just a
Pitt student. , . V

There’s something different about the
Panthers compared to the pros. You get to
know the players‘. You pass them on the street
and stand behind them in line at Burger King.
They’re your age. You’ll have classes with afew
of them, and it will be awkward.

When McGhee’s collegiate career ended
against Butler with the kind of losses reserved
for the bad guys in cheesy movie plots, it hurt.
He was a folk hero at Pitt. Jamie Dixon, who
you’ll quickly learn is an idol here, took a player
that wouldn’t have cracked any other elite
program and turned him into an absolute
mammoth in the paint, yet his time at Pitt
ended painﬁllly. '

Still, it’s not all bad. It’s actually almost
entirely good —— we just have a tendency to

' go out with a bang. _
Few schools can rival Pitt basketball’s re-

cord over the past 10 years, and the ones that
can are programs like Duke and North Caro-
lina. Mock the conference, but Pitt football

_perennially competes fora BCS bowl -— at

least until TCU shows up in 2012..
Pittwrestling is dominant. Baseball, sbccer

and softball all have bright days ahead of them

thanks in part to a new athletic complex.
The Panthers come out ahead in as many

' close games as they lose. The basketball team

came back from seven points down in the
ﬁnal minute to defeat West Virginia in triple

_ overtime two years ago. With how often the

Panthers had shellacked Connecticut entering
this year’s Big East tournament,‘f'ate just tried
to balance everything out.

Pitt fans don’t dwell on losses. Few people‘
blame Nasir Robinson for his foul in the NCAA
Tournament. We know he had 16_ points that
night. Andrewjanockds name didn’t become
like that of Steve Bartman —— the Cubs fan
who reached for a ball and ruined a potential
second out for his own team — or Scott Nor-
wood — who missed a 47-yard ﬁeld goal for
the Buffalo Bills at the end of Super Bowl XXV

S — after hebotched the hold against Cincin-

nati and allowed the Bearcats to take the Big
East Championship. People have forgotten the

particulars of the play.

Instead, we fall back on memorable wins, of
which there are many. You can still buy “13-9”
T-shirts that venerate Pitt’s win at No. 2 West
Virginia in 2007, a game inwhich theunranked
Panthers were four—touchdown underdogs.

5 ' The entire game is up on YouTube, and,
yeah, we re—watch it. It’s as close as we come

' to a Hollywood ending around here. I

Tm going to bypass the welcome speech about
coming to Pitt and instead skip to what is
important for all of you to know in order to
avoid putting on the dreaded freshman 15.

Iwon’t lie to you, it’s very difﬁcult to come
to college and maintain the same activity
level you did in high school. Gone are the
days of having a 5—foot—8 bald football coach
telling you to run faster and lift harder.

Yet on campus, there are numerous places
to go to exercise.

Let’s start with the largest and probably
the most luxurious ﬁtness center in Oak-

‘Ta‘nd,‘the Baierl Recreation Center. Baierl is
located in the Petersen Events Center on the
lawn level facing Panther and Pennsylvania
Halls.

When you enter Baierl, there are rows of
treadmills, stationary. bikes and elliptical
machines. Facing large windows with a view
of the lawn, thetreadmills give runners a look
at the often snow—covered ground during the
winter months.

Baierl also has several racquetball courts,
which charge only $1 for renting a racket.

The center is stocked with weight ma-

chines near the front of the gym as well as nu-
merous free weights near the back. There are
several racks that can be used for almost any
type of lift: bench press, incline/decline press,
squats, military press and plenty more.

The three racks of dumbbells range from
the lightest weights up to 130 pounds.

In the basement of the weight room there
are locker rooms and a multipurpose room,
oﬁen used for yoga and dance classes.

Baierl is the best-stocked ﬁtness center
on campus with the newest equipment. The
main drawback is the crowd. At certain times
of day —— for instance, after classes let out
and when ﬁtness classes for academic credit
use the equipment — you can expect long
lines.

You’ll ﬁnd that the center also becomes
crowded at the start of the spring semester
when many students try to live up to New
Year’s resolutions. '

If running in place on the treadmills of
Baierl isn’t for you, there is always the option
of going for a run around the indoor track at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

The indoor track isn’t the only thing
that makes the ﬁeld house a good option
for exercise. The building has volleyball and

conference record.

2 In the second round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, the Panthers dropped UNC-Asheville with
a 74-51 score. But in round three, it all came
downto the foul line. ‘

Former Panther Gilbert Browntied the game
against Butler from the line with 1.4 seconds re- A
maining, butcouldn’thitthe secondfoul shotthat
likelywould have secured thevictoryfor Pitt. Pitt
forward Nasir Robinson commitiedafoul while
attempting to rebound the missed free throw.

Butler hit the ensuing foul shots and eventu-
ally advanced to the Final Four. Brown scored24

  
 

, points intheloss. ' .

Although Pitt’s season ended prematurely, A
the Panthers providedfanswith memorable mo-
tnents throughout the season.

' Duringtheregularseason, the Pantherswere

ofplayto tie the gameaI74. , .
V Gibbs led Pitt’s offense’ all season, averaging
lust fewer than 17 points per game and scoring
more than 20 points on 12 occasions during the
Season. In May, Gibbs withdrew his name from

the NBA draft in order to return to Pitt for his
senior season.

Former guard Brad Wanamaker was Pitt’s
other main offensive weapon. Wanamaker av-
eraged about 12 points and ﬁve rebounds per
game, placing him second on the team in both
categories.

and Brown. Nick Rivers, a walk-on and former
team manager, also graduated.

Sophomore J.]. Richardson left the team
following the season, saying that he wanted to
transfer to a school closer to his family in Hous-
ton, Texas.

Next season, the Panthers will rely on rising
seniors Gibbs and Robinson, as well as juniors
Travon Woodall and Dante Taylor.

2011 football season.

in 2010, ,but that will change as he switches
the offense to a no-huddle_attack. At Tulsa,
Graham was adamant about the success of his
up—tempo system. . V

“We are a no—huddle offense,” Graham said,
referring to the system he enacted at Tulsa.
.“We had a 5,000-yard passer, three 1,000-
yard receivers and a 1,0o0—yard rusher [at
Tulsa]. We’ve averaged almost 4,000 yards
passing the football. And the number—one
thing in our system is speed and explosive
power.” . V

The most important position in Graham’s
system is the quarterback, who will have to run
what Graham repeatedly described as ano-

, huddle, high—octane and explosive offense.

' The new offense will pose some challenges
to Pitt’s quarterbacks, all of whom possess
different abilities that will ultimately be effec-
tive in the new system. On the depth chart for
quarterbacks is lastyear’s starter Tino Sunseri,
redshirt freshman Marklvlyers, freshman-An-
thony Gonzalez and redshirt sophomore and
former safety Kolby Gray. V

“We need someone that can manage the
game, distribute the football, and is very disci-
plined about what we’re doing,” Graham said.
“I think we have a guy that can do that, and
more than just one. I’m very pleased.”

Sunseri threw for 2,572yardsand 16 touch-
downs to go with nine interceptions, all on 346
attempts in2010.He also rushed for 108 yards
and two touchdowns on 53 rushes.

Sunseri said he’s enjoying the new of-
fense. ‘

Team loses 6 seniors  

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

‘The Pitt women’s soccer team qualiﬁed
for the Big East tournament for the fourth

S time in six years before falling to DePaul
in the first round, after winning its ﬁnal
three regular season games.

After ﬁnishing the season 7—11—2, the

-' work is just beginning for the Panthers,
who lost six seniors — all starters — to
graduation. The team will have to replace
on-the-ﬁeld performance as well as lead-
ership. .

Of the senior class, perhaps the biggest
loss was Liz Carroll. Carroll, who ﬁnished

‘second in all-time assists, with 11, and
eighth all time in goals, at 8, for Pitt, was
named to the All-Big East third team after
tallying seven assists this season. Head
coach Sue—Moy Chin was "pleased with all
of the seniors.

“Our seniors should hold their heads
high because they accomplished a._lot
throughout their time here at Pitt,” Chin
said._ “For our underclassmen, they know
that the future is bright.”

The future Chin is referring to is both a
aproduct of returning talent and incoming

recruits.“We have a pretty young team,”
Chin said. “But we also have some return-
ing starters who I am looking to for lead-
ership.”

Chin said she’ll look for midﬁelder

play and for ﬁfth-year senior midﬁelder

Last season, junior Ashley Cuba said she
came to Pitt because she believed the team
was going to achieve sizable goals during
her four years at the University.The season
before her arrival, the women ﬁnished
6—1o—2 overall (1—8—2 Big East). -

Chin looks for Cuba to help guide the
Panthers toward those achievements this
season.

“I also expect Abby Baldys, a junior, to
lead the defense and Ashley Cuba, another
junior, to step up and take a little more of a
leadership role up front,” Chin said.

Sophomores Caroline Keefer and Dana
DelleFemine and junior Hayley Neal also
saw a large amount of playing time last
season.

Chin also pointed to defenseman Alyssa

VOLLEYBALL

Panthers welcome promising incoming class

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

.__._.——

The Pitt volleyball team lost seven starters
to graduation — gaps the Panthers need
to ﬁll with younger talent this year.

Sophomore Maria Nicholas said that
while it will be difﬁcult for the team to
adjust without the graduated seniors, the
remaining eight athletes on the roster are
ready to take on larger roles.

“One of the best things we have going
for us is the fact that we are a close group
of teammates both on and off the court,”
she said. -

The Panthers will also welcome eight
new recruits this summer, including three
High School All-Americans. Still, Pitt must
work to replace much of the experience
on a team that ﬁnished 13-18 overall and
7-7 in the Big East Conference. The Pan-
thers ﬁnished the regular season tied for
sixth in the 15-team conference, but fell

to Marquette in their ﬁrst game in the Big

East Tournament.

The graduated seniors accounted for
64 percent of Pitt’s offense and 65 percent
of its defense. .

Among last year’s graduates were
Imani Harperand Amy Town, who earned
All-Big East accolades that season as a re-
sult of their performances throughout the
year. Harper led the Panthers in blocks,
while Town paced the team in kills, at-
tacks that result in an immediate point or

'"’ side out and aces, serves that result in an

immediate point. The Panthers also lose

action last year. ' , '

Setter/defensive specialist Nicholas

 also has conﬁdence in next year’s team.
Vf She noted that a solid core group of play-
fi érs remain from last year that have the
 qualiﬁcations necessary to head a suc-
_. qgssful team.

...n. M.-

Nicholas referred to her team as “one
big family,” and in June that family ex-
pands as the new recruits t_o the Pitt pro-
gram arrive and full team practices be-
gin at Fitzgerald Field House. The season
will open in August. Both, Nicholas and
Phillips look forward to that time with
excitement. H

“The incoming class is extremely tal-
ented and they know each other well al-
ready,” Phillips said. “They are incredibly
excited to get started with practices and

-eventually the season.”

Rens said the incoming class will pro-
vide balance and experience.

“We added to many parts of our game
and in every position,” he said. “Another
huge strength of this group is its winning
mentality and competitive attitude. Our
2011 roster will be the most athletic team
in the Big East.”,

Three of the newest Panthers, Mechael
Guess, Jessica Wynn and Lindsey Zitzke,
were named high school All-Americans.

Guess is a 5-foot-11 outside hitter from
Louisville, Ky., who has had a successful
high school career, including an appear-
ance in the 2010 National Champion-
ship Game (open division) with her club
team. “

“Mechael is a long, lean athlete who
has the skill to play at a high level because
of her athletic aptitude,” Rens said. “She

Students can travel from Oakland to
Heinz Field by taking the buses provided
by the University or using Port Authority
buses.

on game days, Pitt buses line Bigelow
Boulevard and transport students to the
stadium. After the game is over, the buses
line up on Art Rooney Avenue to take stu
dents back to Oakland. c

Tailgate on the Great Lawn. For free, the Pitt
athletic department provides students with
‘fgrill packs,” which consist of hot dogs,
buns, cookies and other treats. Thereis a
D], and the Pitt cheerleaders and Roc will
almost certainly make an appearance.

If students want front-row seats, plan
on waking up very early. Seats work on a
ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. Gates open
two hours before kickoff, but students of-
ten line up four to ﬁve hours in advance to
obtain good seating.

the stadium, it is possible to save seats,
but keep the number low, and stand your
ground.” _

Unlike football tickets, ‘men’s basket-
ball tickets are more difficult to come by.
Since the Petersen Events Center has more
limited student section seating, students
‘must participate in a competitive process
ingwhich they accumulate loyalty points.

g Loyalty points are awarded to students
for attending both men’s and'women’s bas-
ketball games. Occasionally, the athletic
department will ‘offer loyalty pointsfor
attending other .sporting events, such as
wrestling matches. Students should watch
for announcements offering loyalty points
throughout the. year. Tickets are scanned
and points are tracked online on the stu-
dent MyPitt portal. Exhibition games cost
$2 to attend, whereas regular season men’s

géames cost $5 to attend.

  to your student account. Click on

“Make sure to check for available seats

at the basketball games even if you don’t ‘

get to claim any,” Ray said. “Often people
won’t claim them, and they become ﬁrst
come, ﬁrst serve.” '

Every basketball game operates on a
lottery in which students log on to their
MyPitt to request a ticket and are notiﬁed
two days later as to whether they have been
awarded a ticket. ‘

Two days before the game there is a
registration period during which students

request tickets. If the demand is smaller
than the supply, all students are awarded

' a ticket. If demand exceeds supply, though,

the system operates by loyalty points.
Students who are not awarded ticketsvare
placed on the waiting list. '
After the registration period comes a
two-day claim period. Students who have
been awarded a ticket must claim it within
48 hours, or it will be offered to the stu-

T dents on the waiting list, who then have

24 hours to claim their ticket.

For games without great demand —— 0?
when there are leftover tickets .— tickets
will become available immediately, other—

then print a ticket to be scanned for entry

“Ordering basketball tickets is verge

said. “All you have to do is go to the ex-
hibition games against the smaller teams
to get loyalty points to make sure you get

tickets to the bigger Big East games later

and I didn’t leave the Pete until the next day when
the game was over.” ’

Some students handle other extremesin
order to watch games from the Zoo. Pitt senior
Evan Gombos attended]anuary’s 89-81win over
Marquette the day after he tore his ACL, MCL
and meniscus in his right knee.

“Crutchingallthewayup to the Peteinsnowy

Only one nonconference team, Bucknell, has
ever won at the Petersen Events Center.

“When you’re playing some of the smaller
schools that aren’t used to the big—time atmo-
sphere, those arethe teams that really get shaken
up.”jedlicka said. I '

The Panthers are also 9-0 against Top 5

overall Pitt is a staggering 149-12. According to

they are 91-7.

' “The Oal<landZoo iswhere Tops teams come
to die,” Schroeder said. “9-0 againstTop 5 teams
is unbelievable, and the team always points to the
Zoo as one of the reasons for that record.”

Schroeder said the Zoo helps the team rally
whenitneeds motivation. He recalled Pitt’s thrill-
ing come—from—behind 98495 triple-overtime
win over West Virginia in February 2010 as an
example.

“You can literally feel the Zoo affecting the

waythe gameis going,” he said. “WhenWVUwas
ahead with 30 seconds to go with the ball, the Zoo
turned around and got everyone in the stadium
to get up and make noise on the play. Result: ball

v The winning atmosphere has helped cultivate
the Zoo’s routine: Newspapers that contain both
teams’ lineups and directions for ﬁrst—timers

bers act like they’re reading the paper as the

That jumping continues every time the op-

The Fighting Irish ran down the shot clock on
nearly every possession, causing the game to

the Zoo by running in place or by faking sitting
down.

As silly as some of the Zoo’s antics are, the
student section’s popularity and enthusiasm have
made it a valuable football-recruiting tool for
the University. ‘ _ - ‘

Before deciding to attend Pitt, current red-
shirt junior Shayne Hale attended a 2007 game
against Oklahoma State, and by the end of the
ﬁrst halfhe had left his seat next to then—coach
Dave Wannstedt and had donned a gold shirt
with the rest of the Pitt students. He committed
to the school less than a month later.

aged in the basement of the building, the weight
room in Trees does not have the‘ glamour of

bit aged, is more than suitable, especiallyfor
those seeking free weights.

On the second ﬂoor of Trees Hall, a

quetball courts located in the basement near
the weight room. A
Trees also houses a few multipurpose
rooms. In the basement there is a mat room,
where classes and clubs meet to work on
various martial arts forms. On the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
another multipurpose room houses training
for a number of clubs on the hard ﬂoor or the

ways the option of swimming to stay in shape.

Trees Hall and Belleﬁeld Hall both have pools
that are designated for lap swimming.

Belleﬁeld also has a small weight room
with free weights and a basketball court on
the second floor.

Other on-campus ﬁtness centers are lo-
cated in many of the residence halls. These
rooms, open 24'hours, are convenient for any
schedule and do serve a purpose for those
looking for treadmills and a limited machine-
weight selection. -

New students can visit www.intramurals.

pitt.edu for information on the various ﬁtness
centers on campus. Under “Facility Informa-
tion”, students can ﬁnd when the facilities
are open to the public, as well as locations
on campus and contact information. 
For outdoor sports, the best places to play
are the lawns around the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and the lawn next to the Petersen Events
Center. On these areas, it is pretty common to
see students taking part in games of football,
kickball and Ultimate Frisbee. , pl
On upper campus behind Sutherland Hall,
the Cost Sports Center provides students
with an indoor turf ﬁeld, which has seen
itsshare of Ultimate Frisbee, soccer and,la-
crosse games. ’ 
L And if you’re not looking for a ﬁeld or
an indoor facility, there is always the op-
tion of getting your exercise done around
campus and in neighboring areas. Schenley
Park offers a lot of open space to play sports
on the grass, as well as running and biking
trails. Located just a few minutes off campus,
the park is a common destination for,-I_?,itt
students. . - . - ,_ 
Schenley Park is also home to Bob
O’Connor Golf Course, Schenley Oval Sports-
plex and Skating Rink, which includes tegnis
courts, a running track, a soccer ﬁeld and a
cross country course, a_ swimming pool;an
a disc golf course. . ‘ -
The great thing about Pitt is that while the
school is considered urban, the area is still
safe and usable for runners and bikers. Run-
ning, walking and biking allow new students
to get outside and learn about their city- and
their surroundings.
The Mayo Clinic, a nonproﬁt leader in

medical care, recommends that people ’

consult a doctor before beginning physi-
cal activity if they have asthma, diabetes,
or heart, liver or kidney disease. Students
should also consult a doctor if they experi-
ence dizziness or pain in their neck or chest
during exercise. -

The American College of Sports Medicine

V recommends that people consult a doctor

before beginning an exercise program if? they
smoke or stopped smoking within the last
six months, they are overweight or haven’t
exercised for three or more months or if they
have high blood pressure or cholesterol.

A The Mayo Clinic website also offers an ex-
ercise guideline designed for people who are
just beginning a ﬁtness program. The clinic
recommends assessing one’s ﬁtness level,and
designing a corresponding ﬁtness program
that outlines goals, a balanced routine, a
variety of activities and time for recovery.
The clinic also recommends that students just
beginning to exercise prepare equipment,
such as athletic shoes that ﬁt properlygiand
comfortable clothing. . 

/' Once students are ready to begin their
ﬁtness program, they should start slowly
and build gradually, while breaking up exer-
cising into short periods and resting when

needed. H ‘

Quarterback key position in Graham’s system

Football 4 103

“I like it a lot because I think we’re able to
show off our team speed as well as my arm
strength and me as a runner,” Sunseri said.
“I think that I am doing a good enough job of
keepingthe defense honest. I understand I am
not a guy who is going to break off 80-yard
runs, butl can get us 10 yards or 15 yards, just
enough to keep the defense honest.”

‘Freshmen Mark Myers and Anthony Gon-
zalez are also working at quarterback.

“[Myers] is alot more athletic than mostbig
guys,” quarterbacks coach Todd Dodge said.
“He does some things with his feet that I didn’t
think he would be able to do. The speed of the
game for Mark is continuously starting to slow
down [as he learns the offense] .”

‘Gonzalez was named one of the Ed Conway
Award winners, given to the most improved
players during the spring practice period}

Sunseri said the players needed an adjust-
ment period to grow comfortable with the
new offense. I

V -f‘The ﬁrstdaywhenwe gotoutthere, when _

everybody was rtmning from drill to drill and

everybodywas yelling ‘high octane’ and [wide V

receiver coach Mike] Norvell was yelling to
hurry up, we kind of looked at each other like,
‘Whoa, we’re not used to this,”’ Sunseri said
after Pitt’s‘Blue- Gold Game.

 ii  said that his system can be difﬁcult
to follow.He will rely greatly on the players he
puts on the ﬁeld to make quick and accurate
decisions; even more so than a coach would in
a p’1"o—style offense because there is less time
between plays, less time to call plays, and less
time for the coaches to react.

“This system is hard to implement because
it is'7so technical and diﬁicult, which is why a
lot of coaches abandon the idea of it,” Graham
said. “You need smart players that are disci-
pliffed and have great character because it is
 precise.”

i’1‘—’l;lunning back Ray Graham leads the Pan-
ther backﬁeld after the departure of Lewis
and Hynoski. Graham ran for 922 yards last
season. a , V .

- With standout wide receiver Baldwin hav-
ingleft the program, sophomore Devin Street
will have the opportunity to make a statement
attife position. The Panthers also return senior
Mike Shanahan, who ﬁnished the 2010 season
With 43 catches for 589 yards, makinghimthe
team’s second-leading receiverbehind Baldwin.
Despite making a reputationfor himselfon the
offensive side of the ball,, Graham also has had
success on the defensive side as well.

In Graham’s ﬁnal year‘ at Tulsa, his defense
racked up 36 turnovers, good enough for third
in the NCAA. The co—de_fensive coordinator of
tlhﬁt?-team, Keith Patterson, followed Graham
to‘Pltt and will serve as defensive coordinator
f01‘?the Panthers next season.

“The number one defense in the confer-
ence usually wins the conference,” Graham
Said. “We need to force turnovers as much as
Weiéan, especially early" on.” I .

 '? 3'l’\hat methodology is achange from Wanns -
edt’s system, which emphasized minimizing

yards allowed and forcing three—and—outs.
Chas Alecxih and Myles Caragein return
on the interior for Pitt’s defense. Alecxih ﬁn-
ished the 2o10 season with 57 stops and 7.5
sacks, while Caragein added 30 tackles and
two sacks. ..
In his ﬁrst year at Rice University, Graham

led the Owls to their ﬁrst bowl berth in 45 years ’

and improved the team record by six wins from
the previous year.

In his ﬁrst two years at Tulsa, he led his
teamto an overall 21-7 record, two Conference

, USA West Division titles and repeat GMAC

Bowl championships.

Although Graham and his system often
produce ﬁrst—year success at each program
he takes over, Pitt will be the biggest stage he
and his staff have ever been on. He has never
coached in a conference eli °ble for the BCS
Championship game.

Next season, the Panthers are scheduled to
face top programs the likes of Notre Dame on
September 24, Utah October 15, Connecticut
the next week and of course, West Virginia the

day after Thanksgiving.
As challenging as the on the ﬁeld issues

’ will be, the off the ﬁeld issues are enormous.

After a year where Sports Illustrated and CBS
produced a collaborative report that pointed
to Pitt’s football team as having more playeréa
with police records than any program in Divi-
sion 1 football, the team had to deal with the
Haywood arrest and the sudden departure of
a few stars. Now, Graham will be responsible
for reining in his players and making sure the
program can restore its reputation. I

only twice this season, a 5-0 win over St. Jo-

Panthers ﬁnished 6-9-2 on the season. ’

“Goal scoring, or lack thereof, is always an
issue,’7 Luxbacher said in a statement on Pitt’s
website. “We have a large and talented i_nc6m- -
ing class with a focus on attacking playei§sl._"’

Midﬁelder Ryan Brode agreed that 3the
Panthers need to focus onimproving 0 en

“We need to put the ball in the goal,” he
said after Pitt’s spring season. “Oﬁ'ensive-

The current players are excited to see new
faces join the team. -

“I think we’ll have a good mixture of ex-
perience and yout ,” returning senior mid-
ﬁelder and co—captain Sam Luffy said it?" an
interview. “The competition for playing time
will be good.” ’

Despite the scoring problems last year; the
team was strong defensively and recorded six
shutouts, tied for eighth in the conference,
conceding more than two goals only twice. All
but one of Pitt’s wins were shutouts. 

Two starting defenders,‘ Alex Harrison
and Shane Flowers, and starting goalie 
Kara all return for the Panthers. ' _

This season, they’ll get to try their skills
on a different ﬁeld.

Like the baseball and softball teams this _
past spring, the soccer teams will also mbve
into a new home for the upcoming seasb°n.' -

The Ambrose Urbanic Field, which is a
part of the new Petersen Sports Complex
located on upper campus, uses FIFA—certiﬁed
FieldTurf and could be another key in helping
the team improve this year. ' 5“

“For one, we don’t have to ride 45 minutes
on a bus to every home game, and we are able
to play more home games,” Luxbacher said.
“The ﬁeld surface is excellent and we will
attract larger crowds.” - .

Luffy said the new ﬁeld would help *tl'ie

an injury, as a potential leader.

“I’m really looking forward to seeing
what Alyssa will bring to the table after
her injury,” Chin said. “I really liked what I
saw from her before she got hurt. Now she’s
ready to go and played well this spring.”

The team has reason to be optimistic
after a 4-0-1 spring. The season, which is
used as an exhibition, can be a good indica-
tor for the season to come.

,;3More importantly, their dominance was
accomplished without the injured Ruhe
anh'Kunugi. In fact, the team played all
ﬁve games with only elevenplayers and
noisubstitutes.

 “There are some good freshmen coming
inland some of the other younger play-
ers are going to have to step up this year,”
Chin said.

, Senior Kristina Rioux has the potential A

to £111 a big void left by goalkeeper Morie
Kephart — the school’s all-time wins and
shutouts leader — who graduated this year.
,iSg,lae will compete for the position with
sophomore Nicole D’Agostino.

3,, 4-‘<‘Kristina is a senior and has been here
fgrgthree years — but hasn’t played much,”
Chin said. “I expect her to play well now
that she has the chance, but I expect her to

lagghallenged by Nicole. I’m really excited

about the competition.” .

Joining the Panther’s coaching staff
this year is Chris Logan. Logan, a native
of §toke—on-Trent, England, comes to Pitt
from Slippery Rock University, where he
coached the goalkeepers on both the men’s
and Women’s soccer teams. _

. {‘Chris-brings a very professional out-
loqk,” Chin said. “He is a tireless worker
andrecmiter and really works hard to bring
in the level of players that we need to win
aighampionship. The girls really like him
apg he is really positive.” ’ .

During his tenure at SRU, Logan spent
four seasons working with goalkeeper
Greg Blum. Blum was twice named the
Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference’s
topngoalkeeper and the top goalkeeper
ir;-':R;1e Atlantic Region. Blum was a 2009
All-American and is now playing with the
Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL Pro
League. -

.Ruhe said that Logan is positive on the
sidelines.

-,~_‘,‘;[He] really goes out of his way to help
thg; girls,” Ruhe said. “When they have
trouble with something, he will set up extra
practices with them to help them out.”

Part of the team’s talented youth comes
frgrg its strong recruiting class, which in-
cludes one forward, two midﬁelders, and
tvlachdefenders. A

Forward Kari Cunard Annapolis, Md.,
Was selected to ﬁrst team All-county and
All—state. At midﬁeld, Alexa Matisse, out of
Mgghanicsburg High School, and Lauren
Yogbi, from South Park High School, will
provide serious depth for the Panthers.

Matisse was ranked 73rd in the nation and
2nd in the state for players to watch by
topdrawer.com. . .

At defense, Pitt added Nicole Stiles,
of West Chester, Pa., and Taylor Parisse,
from Cannonsburg, Pa. Stiles is a current
member of the four—time State champion
Penn Fusion club soccer team, who were
also Region I ﬁnalists for three years and is
currently ranked ﬁrst in the country.

Parisse, described as a “naturally ath-
letic player” by Chin, took home 2007

Rookie of the Year honors and was named
to the WPIAL Section 5 All-Section Team
from 2008 to 2010. She was also named
a WPIAL All-star and nominated to the
All—state team.

With all of this talent to go along with
youth and experience, Ruhe isn’t lowering
any expectations.

“We want to advance past the second
round of the Big,East tournament,” Ruhe
said. “It’s something that we have never
done and it would be really great if we could

,}~

accomplish that.”

After ﬁnishing ﬁfth in the Big East Na-
tional division last season, Chin said the
Panthers are setting the bar high.

“We want to get into a position where
we can win a Big East Championship,” shbr
said. “We want to have a winning record
and get back to the Big East tournament,
where we want to play well and advance.
If we play well when we’re there, then we
can make a run. Ultimately, the goal is to

' win a championship.” I
