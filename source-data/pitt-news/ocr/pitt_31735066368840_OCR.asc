classes.  V _ = ,

"At many schools,gsuch as.Dartmouth,_ the class gift is a
tradition. But at Pitt there are no benches, Panthers, pillar
or fountains, because the idea won’t hold water. 

Pitt, struggling ﬁnancially, wouldn’t mind a -class gift,
since that probably would increase future contributions
because’ of students’ closer identification with the University.

,:.-'__And while administrators aren’t completely commercial in
«their attitude toward students and alumni, they must seek

support from anyone who’ll sign a check.
They talk of “maximizing percentages of contributing

alumni’ ’ and ‘ ‘encouraging students to be counted in. ’ ’ More
important than class gifts, in their eyes, are contributions to
the annual giving fund, the year-long fund raising sweep that
swallows all gifts.

“What we do now is to encourage each class to give to the
annual fund,”.said a Pitt official. “We don’t have a unified

Cris Hoel  

co|umnist—at-large

student body, so we went to the various student leaders about

_ 10 years ago and asked about a class gift.

“What we got, essentially, was a rebuff,” he said. “They
wished to participate in fund raising not related to the
University. We didn’t want to interfere; if that’s what they’re
interested in, great. We haven’t gone back since then.”

If the idea of a class gift (whichvmight not pay the bills as
would a check but which would serve both donor and school

' . far better) were to surface at Pitt, the administrator said, “the
' impetus would almost have to come from student

government. ’ ’ ~
But don’t look at student government president Jos
Baylson here. His assessment, probably correct, is that most

  pm nmnsrone {Bfetncihiies to roowall Helmets  B      

Pitt students wouldn’t give Pitt a cent more than the $758 an
undergraduate pays each term.

“People don’t come to Pitt for an education,” Baylson
said, not hiding his unhappiness with the analysis. “They
come to buy a diploma-—to get a better job, to go to
professional school. To make more money.”

“Going to school is not so special any more,” said Reich,
who attended classes in a new Cathedral of Learning 40 years
ago. “Students once were the top of their class,
academically, and going to college was a big thing.

“An undergraduate degree is almost nothing anymore,
and people have lost those deep roots connecting them with
the place where they got their degree. There's no deep-felt
sense of responsibility.

“We really appreciated the idea of being there," Reich
added. “We felt it was a great school despite the fact some of
the things you have now, like Phi Beta Kappa, weren’t on
campus then. (Pitt had won ﬁve national football
championships in an eight-year span at that time.)

“But it’s different now, and even though they don’t know
it, the students today are missing something,” he concluded.
“They really are.” A

Whatever is missing probably also is that which would lead

’ to the purchasing of tangible class gifts. The Class of 1939
had that something, however, which is probably the reason

no one from that year misses the few bucks that went toward
a stone‘ bench sitting between the Cathedral and the
Stephen Foster Memorial. \

Graham also said the protestors

‘ “Then today is the start of the
emergency,” Graham said, calling
for every Pennsylvanian to imme-
diately stop paying property taxes.

“You can legally do that,
lawfully do that for two years, and
they can’t- take your home,” he
said.

Peter Flaherty, the Democratic
candidate for governor, told the
protestors he supported the con-
cept of Proposition 12. But. he was
roundly booed when he said the
measure needed “reﬁnement.” '

‘‘I’m not here today to make any
magic promises. . . Proposition 12
does propose a viable alternative...

lt provides a framework for

discussion...It is an important ﬁrst
step,” Flaherty said. .

Rep. Richard McClatchy, chie
sponsor of the Proposition 12
legislation, told the protestors he
sympathized with them, even if
they were a bit rowdy.

“It’s about time people began to
shout,” he said.

The shouting often included
vitriolic attacks on legislators.

At one point, when Manderino

‘ and other leaders failed to com

\

outside, Graham said:
“They’re a bunch of gutless
wonders...If they won’t come out
and see us,'I suggest we go in and
see them.” A
After Irvis ejected the protestors

_from the House, Graham said, “I
‘think he’s an idiot. That’s about

what I expected, when you have
crooks and leeches: and blood-
suckers in office there.”

Tony Esposito of Abington, one

of the rally speakers, called

Pennsylvania politicians “a bunch

of bums, parasites and blood- ‘«
'suckers...Don’t let ’em put us out

of our homes.” A

Not all the protestors seemed
interested in property "taxes. One
speaker,‘ wearing a ﬂag and a
10-gallon hat, attacked the loss oi

Victim ‘Survey Studies
Rope's Lasting Impact

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Stall Writer

Rape and the long-term effects of
this ever-increasing crime are the
subject of a county-wide survey
now being conducted by a Pitt
professor.

Dr. Barbara Shore, research
coordinator with Pitt's School of
Social Work said the study, which
is being_ funded by the National
Institute of Mental Health, will
explore changes in the lives of
women victimized_by the crime.
Shore added that she particularly is
concerned with the treatment
received by rape victims from
medical and judicial ofﬁcials. Guilt
feelings are frequently generated
by those officials, she said.

The project was initiated in July
1977 and will not be completed
until early next year, but Shore said
some data collected was available.
Shore’s findings to -date include:

—Seventy-ﬁve percent of the
victims intervied claimed to be
sexually assaulted by a stranger or
someone only vaguely familiar to
them. ' '

—More than ﬁfty percent of
those participating in the study
listed the rape itself and/or the
ensuing criminal and medical
investigations as the most serious
situation ever faced in their lives.

‘fAlthough other studies have
been done, no real attention has
been given to rape “victims, to the
aftermath of this crime and the
problems facing them,” Shore
said. “Our primary goal is to
provide the best information that
we possibly can to the general
public and to the courts to influence
themvand make them realize the
seriousness of the crime.”

Shore reported the Pitt study is
unique in that it;involved a large
portion of the minority sector of_

Crime
Report

ByPATTY TASCARELLA «

Pltt News Statt Writer
Two Pitt students were

charged with malicious prowling on
the Towers patio at 2:07 a.m.
Monday according to campus

police. They were using binoculars

to peer into the rooms of female
students. They were advised that
their actions were not to be
continued.

Th_ree individuals were involved
in a fracas in the Quadrangle at

"3205 a.m. Monday, campus police

reported. Two individuals were
treated at Presbyterian hospital
and were later arrested. A warrant
was issued for the third individual.

A ten-speed Schwinn bicycle,
valued at $120‘, was reported stolen
from the Forbes Professional
Quadrangle Tuesday. The owner
had parked the. bicycle there while
he met with an instructor. Upon
returning, he found the lock cut.
an investigation by campus police
is continuing. '

Campus police report that
sixteen dozen white towels were
stolen from Trees Hall sometime

‘betweenzlune and September. The

theft was not discovered untila
Tuesday. Investigation is ‘con-
tinuing.

There was an attempted theft of
a gmicroscope at Clapp Hall
Wednesday. Campus police found
the door to a room where
microscopes are stored open. A
locker containing microscopes’
had pry marks on the door and’
screws removed from a doorknob.

Allegheny County, one that has in
the past been ignored when
conducting such surveys. Shore
believes this portion of the study
will show the true effect of rape on
minorities. ’

Shore said the Pitt survey failed
to agree with ‘national surveys that
have found that the divorce rate
among rape victims is generally
high.

Another area also touched by the
study was the use of rape crisis
intervention centers.

“We have two excellent centers
right here in Allegheny County,”
Shore said. “One right here in
Oakland is the Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape and the other located
downtown called the Center for
Victims of Violent Crimes.”

Shore said that a rape crisis
center does not exist on «the Pitt
campus, but the Oakland-based

center does work closely with the '

University.
Although the Allegheny County
survey is still incomplete,» Shore

seemed optimistic that some good .

will come of the work being done.

“From this study we might
better learn how to deal with the
crisis, while understanding the
impact of the entire situation,”
Shore said.

 ;lflNow that the proposal to
__ "renovate the existing Schenley
7 Hall facilities has been approved

by Chancellor Posvar, members

pf the. administration‘ are

éoncéiﬁfﬂiemselves with ‘tire "
 of this miilti-million
dollar project.

“During the next two weeks
‘we will be sitting down with
members of the Student Gov-
ernment Board, the depart-
ments that use the building, the
University consultant and the
architect, to look at space
requirements,” Willard “Bud”
Heaps, director of student
activities said. “After this the
consultant will have a clearer

-.

building and can then sit down
with the architect to formulate a
design.” _

Heaps said all the major users
of the building, both faculty and
student organizations, will be
contacted for input into how they
would like to see the building
renovated.

“At this time we are trying to
ascertain who it is we have
involved and just what it is they
would like to see and then to
gather this information and ﬁnd
a ‘way to make it work best,”

_Heaps said.

Heaps noted that the item
topping the agenda at this
moment is where to ;move
various organizations and de-
partments during the, renova-
tion.

 of.-...,. Pld" :e.......v...~.-.,.. Details After pom. ox.   

“The ultimate plan would be
to close the Student Union
completely, moving everyong
out of the building to another
location, but there just isn’t
enough space available for
this,” Heaps said.

Heaps added that the admin-

. istration is not only faced with

the problem of where to relocate
the various‘ tenants of Schenley
Hall but also where to put them
when work is ﬁnally completed
in order to make the building
functionally more efficient. In
theory, Heaps noted, the
most-used student services
should be on the floors closest to
the ground.

Another area of debate that

must be resolved isithe question-

of ground floor. activities

involving the Kurtzman Ball-
room and the Lower Lounge.
“The entire project is incred-
ible, ’ ’ Heaps said. ‘ ‘Just picture
stepping out into the hallway in
Schenley Hall and imagine
seeing nothing. That is exactly
where we have to start.”. .
Heaps said that work was
begun this week by represen-

tatives of the architectural firm
to perform a daily traffic count to ‘

see how many people pass
through Schenley Hall daily.
According to Heaps, this was
done to aid in possible rerouting
procedures aimed at alleviating
crowds.

On the subject of funding,
Heaps reiterated what both he
and acting vice chancellor for
student affairs William Markus

had stated earlier, that no
specific. funding schemes would
be available until all the
preliminaries have been com-
pleted.

“We have not established a
concrete method of funding as of
yet because at this point we
cannot evenbegin to talk hard
dollars and cents,” Heaps said.
“We know that it will run into

.millions but beyond that we

don't know.”

“Schenley Hall is structurally
a .sound building,” Heaps

concluded. “It is now our job to '

make it a building that students
can step back, look at and be
proud of, while at the same. time
making it functional.”

Union Turns Down
Direct Strike Ballot

By the Associated Press

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.—DeIe-
gates to a United Steelworkers of
America convention yesterday
thwarted a bid by a dissident group
to grant rank-and-ﬁle workers in the
basic steel industry a direct
ratiﬁcation vote on newcontracts;

Currently, contracts with the
major steel producers are ratiﬁed
only by local union leaders. But
some delegates to the 19th constitu-
tional convention said that such a
process is undemocratic.

“I’ve always been in favor of
ratiﬁcations because it’s the right

thing to do,” said James Balanoff,_

director of the USW’s District 31 in
East Chicago.

“-That idea’s time has come,”
said Balanoff,' who vowed, to
continue to ﬁght for ratification “so
every member has a democratic way
of voting for a contract.”

The effort to establish rank-and-
ﬁle ratiﬁcation was defeated by a
voice vote among the almost 4,000
delegates attending the meeting in
Convention Hall here.

The only speciﬁc show of strength

,by the dissidents came on a demand

for a roll call vote on the question.

Only 316 delegates stood for a roll

Legislature

Nears Passage
Of Ethics Code

"By the Associated Press

HARRISBURG'—The House and
Senate, pressured into election-

year action by recent reports of *

spending abuses, set. the stage

yesterday for passage of a tougher '

ethics code.

The House neared ﬁnal passage
of its ‘toned-down version, inserting
the code in the form _ of an
amendment ‘tota bill that‘will be

_ considered today.

The code, approved, 183-7, was
amended into a bill that deals with
conﬂict of interest among local
ofﬁcials. That bill is expected to
pass today. 

Since the .Senate already has
“approved the conﬂict of interest bill,
the amended version will ‘go directly
to the Senate floor for concurrence
without getting bottled ‘up in
committee. .

Meanwhile, the Senate State
Government Committee reversed
itself by hammering out a strict
ethics measure during a 4 1/ 2-hour
session.

The committee’s unanimous

. approval of the code comes just one

week after Democratic leaders
stalled the bill by saying it needed
more study. Now the full Senate has ‘
the option of voting for its own strict
version or on the House version of
the ethics code.

“It’s a very big step that the
citizens of this state want to see
their Legislature take,” said Sen.
Vincent Fumo, a Philadelphia
Democrat who voted to table ethics
reform for further study last week.

Under the Senate version,
legislators and other state officials
would be required to ﬁle yearly
ﬁnancial disclosure statements. It
would not require speciﬁc dollar

amounts of income, but ofﬁcials

would have to list sources of their
outside income.

Lawmakers would also be barred
from receiving any compensation
for representing anybody before a
state board or regulatory agency.

An amendment offered by Fumo
would prevent the hiring of relatives

of legislators and other state -
employees for state jobs within the

same branch of government.

"last year.

1,-e.

call, compared with the approxi-
mately 1,200 delegates required to
force a roll call.

The issue represented a revival of
a debate waged during the union's
bitterly-fought presidential election

Losing. presidential candidate
Edward Sadlowski, who had been
District 31’s director, supported
ratiﬁcation. His victorious oppon-
ent, USW President Lloyd McBride,
opposed granting basic ‘Steelwork-
ers ratiﬁcation votes. '

USW members employed in other
industries have direct ratiﬁcation
rights, something that those in basic
steel have never had.

,McBride argued against direct
ratiﬁcation on Sunday, saying it
might undermine the current system
of industry-wide bargaining on a
single contract.

He said the current ratiﬁcation
process has given Steelworkers
among the best contracts in a
American industry.

Under direct ratiﬁcation, workers
at one company -might reject the
same contract approved at another
company" and thereby force- a ‘
collapse in industry-wide negotia-
tions.

Asscissincition” Cornmittee Interview 

By the Associated Press

WASHINGTON—-Fidel Castro, in

 interview made public yesterday,

told House investigators it would
have been “insane” for him to have
conspired in John F. Kennedy’s
assassination.

Castro said his involvement in any
murder plot would have given the
U.S. government “the most perfect
pretext” for an invasion of the island
nation. The Cuban president also
repeated his belief that an effort was
made by someone in the United
States to implicate him‘ in Kennedy’s
Nov. 22, 1963, assassination.

Portions of Castro’ s interview

I ﬁﬁere played by the House assassina-

tion committee, which is seeking to
tie up the loose ends to Kennedy’s
assassination so that a report can be
issued in December.

In his interview with House
investigators and committee mem-

_ bers, last April, Castro contended it

would" have been insane for him to
play a role in Kennedy’s murder.
“That would have been the most

\perfect pretext for the United States

to invade our-country, which is what I
have tried to prevent for all these
years, in every possible sense," he
said. ‘ ‘

Castro also said he suspects that

\accused, assassin Lee Harvey
1' ~’Oswald’s effort to get into Cuba two

months before the assassination
“was ‘a deliberate attempt to» link
Cuba to Kennedy’s death.

“I said to myself, ‘What would
have happened had by any chance

_ that man come to Cuba, visited

Cuba, gone back ‘to the United
States and then appeared involved
in Kennedy’s death?” Castro said.

“That would-have really been a

provocation-—a gigantic provoca--

tion,” the Cuban leaderadded.
Castro was asked about a

. commenthe had made ina Sept. 7, _

1963, interview with The Associated

ﬁg‘,-‘ress. In that interview, Castro had

warned that death plots against him

could backﬁre. _
I The Cuban leader maintained ,
' that the statement was not given

“as a threat. ...My intention in
saying whatl said. . .was to warn the
government that we know about the
plots against our lives.

' “But I did not mean to threaten
by that,” Castro continued._ “...I
did not mean by that that we were
going to take measures, similar
measures‘, like a retaliation for that.

Castro issued the warning in an
interview with AP reporter Daniel "

Harker about 10 weeks ‘before:

ennedy’s assassination. _
A Senate investigation had found

"that the CIA conspired with

mobsters between 1960 and 1963 to

plot assassination efforts against

the Cuban leader. « ,
The,committee’s chief counsel,

G. Robert Blakey, said the Cuban «

government contends the CIA
might have been responsible for
circulation of a mysterious intel-
ligence report suggesting that
Oswald hinted to officials‘ at the
Cuban consulate in Mexico City that

_ he might kill Kennedy and that

Castro learned of this before the

assassination. ' - _ '

@

' GIVE UNITED WAY

Blakey said Cuban officials
blamed the CIA for circulating the
report as a “disinformation” tactic
to implicate Cuba in Kennedy’s
death. He said the committee has
reached no judgment on the overall
reliability of the intelligence
source for the report.

House investigators also
questioned Castro about a 1967
article in the National Enquirer.

Comer Clark, a British free-lance
journalist who died in 1972, had
written that Castro told him: “Yes,
I heard of Lee Harvey Oswald’s plan
to kill President Kennedy. It’s
possible that I could have saved
him. I might have been able to, but I
didn’t. I never believed the plan
would be put into effect.”

Clark quoted Castro as sayingthe
Cuban officials told him of Oswald’s
visit to the Cuban consulate in
Mexico City about two months
before the assassination. Clark
claimed Castro said he was told that
Oswald said “someone ought to

shoot that President Kennedy’ ’ and M

that he might do it himself.
I

Castro strenuously denied‘ the
National Enquirer story as
“absurd” and said he never
granted Clark an interview.

Blakey, however, said the

  Castro Denies Any~Ties to Kill ing. in

National Enquirer story is said to be-

“supported by highly confidential,
but reliable, sources available to the
U.S. government.”

But Blakey also said an
investigation of Comer ‘Clark’s
reputation for accuracy showed that
“frankly, it was not good.”

In the April interview, Castro

Bay of Pigs invasion gave Cuba no
reason to act against Kennedy
because the invasion would have
been worse if Richard M. Nixon had
been president. ‘

If Nixon had defeated‘ Kennedy in ‘

the 1960 elections, Castro reasoned,
“during the Bay of Pigs invasion, a
landing by the military army of the
United States would have taken
place. ' l

' “However, Kennedy resisted all
the pressures, and he did not do
that,” Castro said.

“H e drank all our Stroh’s.’ ? He really jg abominable!”

, contended that the U.S.-supported .

removal of the settlements. Begin will take this problem to
the Knesset, but has said he will not lobby on behalf of
moving the settlements. In the Knesset, Begin faces severe
political problems. Although it appears he has the votes to
pass the agreement, members of his right-wing bloc are‘
lodging protest at the Camp_ David pact. Talk has already
surfaced concerning a Begin resignation. \
Israel has also agreed to a ﬁve-year transition period
before granting autonomy to the West Bank and Gaza, areas

' heavily populated -by Palestinians. This is ,.not acceptable

even to- most moderate Palestinians, as it excludes the
millions of refugees now living in_other ‘Arab countries.
After the transition, Begin has said_ Israel will not rule in
peoples’ lives “whatsoever.” But yesterday in Washing-
ton, Begin said.‘ he “believes with all my heart that’ the
Jewish people have a right to sovereignty over Judea,
Samaria (his terms,-for the West Bank area) and the Gaza-
Strip.” The prime minister said he also reserves the right

to maintain Israeli security, a sufﬁciently vague intention

meaning virtually anything. Begin must explain these
statements with absolute clarity. "

Begin insists he has agreed to West Bank and Gaza
“autonomy” not “sovereignty.” The difference is crucial.
An autonomous territory can run its internal affairs but not
is foreign affairs. An autonomous territory cannot be

in charge of this West Bank entity? This is another critical
dilemma that must be resolved. ._ . . A .
Now where dothe talks go? Jordan was invited ‘to
participate and yesterday threw a monkeywrench into the
whole process by declaring it was not “obligated morally or
materially” to the Camp David accords. "Since the West‘
Bank is occupied Jordan, Secretary of State Vance’s trip

this week to lobby King Hussein is of extreme importance.

Palestinian representation is also necessary if a
comprehensive peace is to be achieved. The Palestinians,
angry at Israel fof reasons well known and angry at Sadat
for acting as their unappointed negotiator, should be
among the priorities,, and thus present, at future talks.
Frequent mention has beenmade of the “legitimte rights
of the Palestinian people.” All future agreements in the
Middle East revolve around one question: Can a real and

_lasting peace be achieved if ’a group of countries

unilaterally and arbitrarily decide the rights of the
Paletsinians, then determine which of these rights are
legitimate? N A

_ Israel and Egypt have pledged to finalize the agreement

Cameras, as far as‘ I’m con-
cerned, fall into the general
category of those small, mechanical
‘devices, that are usually malevolent

‘and "always intolerably frustrating.

"As a result, I never have had the

slightest interest in owning one.

1 ._ Nevertheless, I am fascinated by
- photography. There are, I under-
stand, '
 knowledgeable people who main-

some presumbly

tain-that the .camera is not a ﬁt

instrument for the serious aes-
thete, but I would beg to differ.

The use of ﬁlm can be every bit as
artistic as, say, painting or
sculpting; in the hands of an artist,
the lens and shutter can capture

' nuances and evoke expression just

as well as the brush or chisel.
Photography that is also art may be
rare in this Instamatic age, but
when it is achieved it presents the
appreciative viewer with an inter-

pretive clarity seldom equaled in
any other medium. '

The Lewis W. Hine exhibition,
on display at the Carnegie Museum
of Art's Scaife_ Gallery through
Sunday, is an example of artistic
photography of .a....special kind.
Representative of early 20th
century ‘photo-journalism at its
best, the Hine ‘collection is not only
pictorial art, but nioral drama and
political polemic as well.

Born in 1874 in Oshkosh, Wis.,

Hine V moved to New York City"

shortly after the turn of the
century. He was an intense,
introspective young man, one who
believed a new day had dawned"for
America's "cities. According to
biographer and art historian Judith
Mara Gutman: “Hine hoped to
ﬁnd a new natural order in concrete
slabs and smoking steel stacks.
Reared in the environment of a
small town, with little industry and
with nature all around, Hine came

to the city to seek the new natural
goodness rather than stay in the
country, He wanted and expected
to see a new human magniﬁcence,

- a transformed humanity, rise out of

the new industrial seedbed.”

What he found was poverty and
death—men and women brutalized
by -rapacious industrialism. In 1905
Hine’-photographed immigrants at
Ellis -Island; dubbing them “raw
material for the ‘melting pot,” he
knew full well that a most were
destined for -_ the "sweatshops, or
worse. -A study of black slum-
dwellers in_._ Washington,
followed, as well as scores of
pictures of newsboys and other
street urchins.

Working for the National Child
Labor Committee in 1908, Hine
used his camera to expose terrible
conditions in the North Carolina
cotton mills, in — Ohio's’ night

markets and in the glass works of
Indiana and West Virginia. His
lens captured “breaker boys” in

the Pennsylvania mines, 10-year-
old_s covered with coal dust and
doomed to black lung at an early

age. Throughout the next several .

years, photographs of children at
work in logging camps, canneries,
cranberry bogs and cotton‘ ﬁelds
came out of R-Hine’s darkroom,

providing at least some of the’

impetus for the labor law reforms
instituted by the time of World War
1.,

I-line photographed skilled

; laborers during the Roaring ,’20s

and chronicled the construction of
the Empire State Building in the
’30s, but his wide-ranging, pre-
1920 portraits of immigrants and
otherwise dispossessed people are
the highlights of the Scaife Gallery

exhibition. Young girls stand on

boxes‘ to work at the spinning
machines in a_ textile mill. A man
dying of tuberculosis huddles on__ a
bed, the sunlight coming through
the window full on ' his white,
unshaven face; his stare lacks an

-object, and his sweater hardly
xwarms him. ‘

Also included in the _ Hine
collection: Pictures of tenement
women, old at 30. Tiny, one-room
apartments with broken ‘furniture,
religious pictures hanging from the
rotting plaster. A bizarre proﬁle of
two retarded children in a" New

family at Chicago's. Hu_ll_I_Iouse.

her, a sign that says, “Temporary

Home for Colored Children.”

The Hine collection is not just a
study in despair, of course.
Laughing children play in the
streets, and a strikingly beautiful
Balkan woman smiles in one of the
photographs Hine took while

‘ working for the Red‘ Cross during
World War I. But the hardships of

so-urbanization and industrialization
provide the dominant motifs in

Hine’s best'early work.

Hine’s photographs bring, to
mind something I-read just a few
weeks ago. Lord John Maynard
Keynes was one of this century's
major ‘prophets of salvation
through economism and a man
whose theories .of inﬂation and
unemployment still influence
Americaneconomic policy. In 1930
he summed up his methodology for
material progress: “For at least

another hundred years we. must ‘
pretend to ourselves and to

everyone that fair is foul and foul is
fair; for foul is usefuland fair is
not.‘ Avarice and usury and

/ii’;

,

precaution must "be our gods for a 

little longer still.”

To anyone who tours the Hine
collection, ‘it is obvious that
American industrialists were fol‘-
lowing Keynes’ dictum long before
1930. One. wonders,-though, what
the English economist had in mind

' when he used the word “useful.”

The avarice that made possible

- Hine’s pictureslof child l_abor and _o
tenements was certainly of little

use to the people‘ inVthe Scaife
Gallery’ photographs. In fact,
perhaps the most important
element in the work of Lewis W.
Hine can be found in the eloquent
testimony his picture‘s"give to the
madness in methods such as

High ’ Food . Prices Predicted

WASHINGTON—The average four-person family’s
grocery bill could rise by as much as $3.40 a week next year if
farm prices are stable, but smaller meatand) dairy supplies
could boost the increase to $6.15 a week, the Agriculture

_Department’s chief economist said yesterday.

That hike would be added to the $6.21 increase foreseen for
1978 for the typical family whose weekly grocery bill was
$62.10 last year. By the end of 1979 then,_ that family would be
spending between $71.71 and $74.46 a week.

Department economist Howard W. Hjort told a House
subcommittee that steady farm prices would mean an
increase of only 4 percent or 5 percent in retail food prices next

year, but private forcasters are predicting a rise of 7 percent »

to 9 percent. _

Food prices this year are expected to average 10 percent
above 1977 averages. Most of that occurred in the first five
months of the year, Hjort told the economic stabilization
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs Committee.

I ‘ ‘For the balance of this year, ‘I’ he said, “they (food prices)
are expected to hold about steady, barring unusual weather

(or other events.”

The'increa <:e was caused mainly by smaller beef supplies,
with ranchers attempting to compensate for four years of
tosses by trimming herds, by weather damage to fruits and

_ vegetables and by a congressional boost in minimum sugar

prices, Hjort said. T ,

An increase-in.farm prices. of about 15 percent this year
accounts for more than half the 1978 boost, he -said.

The cost and profits of food industry middlemen are rising
about 7 percent or 8 percent and account for about 40 percent
of the increase, Hjort said.

Those marketing charges account for about two-thirds of
what consumers pay for food and havebeen responsible for 80
percent of retail price hikes since 1973.

Hjort said prices for imported foods and beverages and for
fish, expected to be 10 percent higher than 1977, account for
the rest of the bite on consumers’ wallets.

In 1979, Hjort said, the major question is whether pork and
poultry producers will take up theslackin the meat supply by
expanding at the same time that beef producers are cutting

l back supplies.

Israel Adament on West Bank:»

WASHINGTON—Prime Minister Menachem Begin told
Congress yesterday that Israel has no intention of giving up
its claim to sovereignty or its right to station troops in
disputed areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Begin told leaders of the House in a breakfast meeting that
they should not misinterpret the Camp David accords to mean

-that Israel has committed itself to restoring Arab sovereignty

to those lands, which it captured in the 1967 war.

Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat met yesterday
with congressional leaders to talk about the recently
concluded summit.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance added
Syrian President Hafez Assad to the list of Arab leaders he
will visiit to explain the Camp David agreements and seek
‘support. He previously had scheduled stops in Jordan and
Saudi Arabia on the trip, which began last night.

Sadat told members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Commmittee he thinks Jordan and Saudi Arabia eventually
will suport the accords. . .

Later, he told reporters he plans to ﬂy from Washington to
Rabat, Morocco, today to meet with King Hassan. Then, he
said, he will fly home to Cairo and make contact with J ordan’s
King Hussein. ’

PITTSBURGH—Inadequate laws in Pennsylvania have
encouraged organized crime to shift some activities from
New York and New Jersey to this state, Allegheny County
District Attorney Robert Colville says.

‘ ‘I hope Pennsylvania will soon come into the 20th century
as far as giving local and state prosecutors the tools they
need,” Colville said. E

Colville said syndicate-backed crimes that appear to have
been exported to Pennsylvania recently include gambling
and narcotics, both of which he said help to support
prostitution. ' A ' .

He made his remarks Monday before an organized crime

seminar sponsored by the National Collegecof District _

Attorneys.

Colville said he supported pending legislation in the state
House that would authorize wiretaps and electronic
surveillance, allow ‘prosecutors to grant immunity to

Traffic officers stopped Taylor on a downtown street early-.

of David R. Willie, 36, who had given him a ride. The car was
‘Willie's, and Taylor led police to the body.

By afternoon, detectives said, Taylor confessed 16 more

University of Pittsburgh Career Seminar Series

Scholarship Abolition  

By the Associated Press .
iHARRISBURG—Rev4ersinig its
decision of a week ago, the Senate
Rules Committee voted‘ yesterday‘
for‘ a resolution" to abolish the

, 97-year-old senatorial scholarship

program.‘

The committee voted, 10-9, to set
a Sept. 1, 1979, date to end the
program, by which some senators
have ‘awarded scholarships’ to
children of well-to-do friends and
political allies. ' 0 _

However, existing .scholarships, .
totaling about $3 million a year,
would not be affected. _ .

The proposal faces an uncertain
future on the Senate floor. Senators
are bitterly divided over the
question. ‘

‘ ‘ I’m going to stand here and ﬁght
forthese scholarships,” said Sen.
Joseph Smith, D-Philadelphia.

2 He saidmany of his middle class
constituents don’t qualify for other
state scholarship or loan programs.

“I thought they were to. aid
people who weren't part" of the
intelligentsia, ” he said.

“To deprive my area of scholar-
ships because of -something sup-
posedly evil leaves me a blank, ” he
said. - V _

He and Sens. Thomas Nolan”
D-Allegheny; and Joseph Gur-
zenda, .D-Schuylkill, said they
would be happy to award scholar-
ships for any senator who dislikes
the program. ' .

Each senator is allowed to issue
100" scholarships worth a total of

about $60,000 to the ﬁve state-
related universities: "Penn State,
Pittsburgh, ' Lincoln, '- Penn « ‘and
Temple. ' " ’ I i A  _
'1 Nolan urged that the issue be
delayed until next’ session, when
senators are not facing an election.

‘ ‘I hate to see something like this
going before the Senate at this time
with 25 senators up for re-election, ‘ ’
he said. f‘It will influencethe way
they vote.” ‘ ' 1

Republican Floor Leader Henry
Hager said the time was ripe for
action. _ _

‘ ‘Now is the best possible time to
get rid of this questionable
practice,” he said. "It seems to me
the thing to do is end it right now
and make a new start.”

Under the resolution, offered by
the late Sen. Wilmot Fleming,
R-Montgomery, the $3 million used
for the scholarships would go to the
other existing program run by the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency.

' " ‘s'en‘.‘ Jeanette Reibman, D-North-

ampfton, has introduced another
- alternative, one that would set up a

system of merit grants.

PI-{BAA would create a testing
program, with the scholarships
going to the top 100 finishers and the
top "student in each senatorial
district. ' '

In addition, each senator would be

permitted to award up to 40
scholarships for graduate students
and each House member 10 such

grants.

ATLANTIC. CITY N.J.—Labor
Secretary Ray Marshall warned
yesterday _that America’s unions
have fallen onhard times because an
increasingly hostile public holds
organized labor responsible for
mounting inﬂation.

In an address to a United
Steelworkers of America convention
here, Marshall urged the 4,000

delegates to cooperate with Carter
administration plans to control
inﬂation and, thereby, help combat
labor’s low standing with the
public.

The labor secretary conﬁrmed the
administration is “placing the ﬁnal
touches on a tough, new4anti-inﬂa-
tion policy, ” but refused to disclose

'any details. He promised the
steelworkers, however, the pro-
gram would be fair to working
people.

banditry is often impossible to prove

Theft of Pitt’s computer time

Criminal Code. The theft would be
tried as a third class felony if the time
was valued greater than $2,000 and
would be punishable upon convic-

Co-Op Begins ,.

New Hours
On Thursday _

By PATTY TASCARELLA

. Pitt News Stalt Writer —

Pitt’_s.Food Co-op, sponsored by
Student Government, will open for
business tomorrow with a change
in format from last semester.
Instead of the pre-paid, preorder
set-up that has typiﬁed the co-op

- since its inception in the spring of

1976, the service will now operate
as a store, open Thursdays and
Fridays from 10 a.m.‘- 6 p,m. in the
Student Union basement.

“The reason we switched is
because we were getting too much
paperwork with the «order lists,
there were shortages and ' the
students weren’t always able to get
items after they’d paid for them,”
said Mark Herman, co-chairman of
the co-op. “Besides, we wanted to
give students a direct choice.”

The store will feature the same

staples as last year‘—fresh pro-

duce. cheese, spices, teas and
bread products. Herman said that
other products, such as yogurt, are
expected to be added as the year
progresses.

“We’re going to have enough
fruits and vegetables so people will
not have to rush in early Thursday
morning,” he stressed. “We will
have proper rotation of produce.
People can get good fruit at 3:30 on
Fridays, the same as they’d get’
Thursday morning.”

People intending to shop at the
co-op must be members of that
organization, Herman said, ‘and
must provide require identifica-
tion. "V I

“All undergraduates are mem-
bers already because the ;co-op is
funded by their student activities

fee,” he said. “Graduate students '

must pay $1 for membership, staff
and faculty $2.“ ’

Membership cards can .be
obtained at the co-op during store
hours. ‘ ' _ \

Plans to expand the store's
operating hours are already under '
according to
Herman, who said» that if the
demand increased, the store may
open V on Tuesdays and Wed-
nesdays.

“Last year, we were a $1,300 per
week business,” he said. “We
expect to double that ﬁgure by
Christmas.” L I

Although the co-op store was
given a trial run last spring, the
operation is not yet in the. ﬁnished

.stages, Herman said. Shoppers are

requested to bring their own bags

and containers for shopping.
“We.don’t plan ‘on it running

perfectly," he said. V

Recycled Mott Rocirs in British-Lions Debut-

'5?‘ British Lions is" the ﬁne new ﬁrst

release from a group of veteran
British rock stars’.

Four of the ﬁve band members are
former members of Mott, an

offshoot band from the well-dressed
and legendary British street-rock
group, Mott the Hoople.

The other, singer John Fiddler, is
a man who played with Medicine-
head, another group to which British
success was much more inevidence
than American acclaim.

Fiddler also seems to be the key to
Lion’s ﬁrst album. He is a strong
songwriter with standout cuts like

"Eyes of Laura Mars’
A Real Thriller Flick

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

_ provocative to some, to pthers ‘sickening’ and evil.

‘_‘Eyes of Laura Mars” is an intense and frightening mystery thriller
that provides a chilling insight _ into the unpredictability of the
supernatural and its impact on a modern career woman.

The ﬁlm has Oscar-winning actress_Faye Dunaway in the title role of e in

Laura Mars, a highly paid, talented and unstable erotic fashion
photographer.

Hers is a fast-paced New York jet-set world in which she is trying to hack '

out a life for herself while trying to find love amid a bizarre set of
circumstances. ‘ . .

Mars photographs erotic models in deathly poses. The type of imagery
suggested is similar to the recent sado-masochistic trend in the
photography depicting women in leather and chains, whips and rouge.

This is the world in which Mars creates her artwork—highly chic and

Mars begins to experience ESP-like visions in which her modelsare
graphically murdered in living color. But she sees the murders and ﬁrst
dreams through the eyes of the killer.

In one gripping scene Mars is shown running through the vast deserted
hallways of her dockside fashion photography studio, seeing herself
through the eyes of the killer while he is chasing her. .

One problem with the ﬁlm is the lack of intensity in many of the ,
._ supporting parts. They do not adequately supply a grisly or mysterious

candidate for the killer. —
Rene Auberjoinois is rather comic at times as her hardworking and

effeminately neurotic agent, always supporting Mars, the pivotal

breadwinner, from one trauma to another. \ ‘

Dunaway is the modern career woman, able to make a place for herself

in a male-dominated society through the means of her talents. and
business savvy. ’ _

However, Mars is the one who is supporting her agent, as well as a
weasly driver, who is, unbeknownst to Mars, a convict andher wimpy and
alcoholic husband (played convincingly by Raul Julia).

Julia comes to her when he is suspectedof the murder of one of their

sticky details.

In contrast to Mars’ goddess-like presence is newcomer Tommy Lee ,
Jones. He plays a macho, street-wise New York cop who ﬁnds jet-setter ‘

Mars falling in love with‘- him. ,
~ Jones isboth handsome and a capable actor. He is well-matched with
Dunaway in these role portrayals. ,
However, the match does not spell happiness for _Mars as she is

Life in Your Hands” and “Break
This Fool.” Fiddler is the closest the
Mott members have had to a
legitimate songwriter since Ian
Hunter called it quits with Mott the
Hoople in 1974. _

Mott’s problem was the absence
of Hunter’s raspy voice and
intelligent. lyrical wit. His creativity
surfaced when the~band tried to
carry on - underneath the Mott
banner without him in the spotlight.

However, bassist'Overend Watts,
drummer Bufﬁn, pianist Morgan
Fisher and guitarist Ray Major are
conside_red ‘competent rock‘ ’n
rollers. They add an exciting rock ’n
roll base to the bulk of The British
Lions’ debut effort.

Columbia because of poor album

Ifthings go as planned for Frank
Zappa, we should soon be seeing
his latest ﬁlm venture, “Baby
Snakes,” and a new album. Due to

unﬁnished movie is on hold until
Zappa can get more ﬁnancial aid.

“.I’ve already spent $400,000 on

“Most of the movie has already_

“Because,” he sid, “what else. am
I gonna call it?"

Zappa goes even further in his
eccentricities. He has ‘three
children: two sons, Ahmet E.
Rodan ' and Dweezil, and a
daughter, Moon Unit. He named

‘ his daughter Moon Unit, he said,

“for the same reason I named the

11-year-old Moon Unit should have
no trouble getting’ into the music

“No,” said Zappa. “She’ll
probably be an actress...I mean,
she goes to school and every-
thing.”

Zappa, on the other hand, did
not go to any college'or graduate
school to learn his music. The only
course he took was during senior
year in high school, when he was
able to take a college course in

harmony. Otherwise, his music -

education stems from hard work at
the libraries and beginning stints in
various bars and cafes. His music
continues to improve and thrive‘

«even with the disco craze “now

“I’ve been known to frequent a
few discos,” he said. “I just sit

The camera_ work and action photos are beautifully executed. The
visions through the killers eyes are almost pornographic in their

depiction.

The musical score, featuring the goldenthroat of Barbara Streisand
(Yes, Jon Peters did produce the ﬁlm) singing the hit single from the
movie, “I’m Like a Prisoner, ” is appropriate in accenting the fast-paced

world of Mars.

Boston has good musicians,
though, and they might even be

- able to write well. “Used to Bad

News” proves it. Its intro indeed is
interesting, downright innovative.
But the droning rock rhythm and
that same whining guitar take over
to make it ordinary.

The best portion Boston has to
offer here is “A Man I'll Never Be.”
The lyrics are almost intelligent for a
change, and the distinctive
" ‘Boston’ ’ sound becomes more than
the humm of a motor.
keyboards accentuate the guitar
chords, and an acoustic piano make

, for a ’nice beginning and ending.

Boston is one of those bands that
has a huge appeal. They sold out the
Civic Arena last month. President
Nixon, though, also was a great
crowd pleaser. .

Theatre Express’ “The Unlit

intimate experience in sight and
song.

William Tumer’s creation, billed
as “vampire vaudeville,” is a
bizarre opera, narrated in limericks. 1
Its absurdity proves hilarious at

times, yet professional always.

The story line is ﬂimsy and
predictable. It revolves around a
man staying ‘in a, castle of four
ludicrous vampires. their maid and
butler. His ghoulish fate is

Susan Cash, Jed‘ Harris, Jocelyn v

Johnson, Linda n Mauriello, Barry
Plumlee, Joellen Sharp‘, J.
Lawrence Smith and Thomas
Spinella compose the cast of
“Corridor.” Their timing is
precise, a quality that helps the play
come off as well as it does, and their
singing is peerless. Tumer’s songs
and limericks are as good and
imaginative as they are ghastly. '
The atmosphere’ of Theatre
Express plays a major part in
making this show successful. If one

Theatre’s deceiving outward ap- I

pearance, they will ﬁnd the place

allits own. Although it is not yet
complete, Theatre Express would
do themselves no harm by leaving it
in its present condition.

‘Had “Corridor” been done by ‘.8.

repulsively. Instead, Theatre
Express, combined with fine acting,

change of pace.

downs. A ‘

college coaches, is quick to attempt
to thrust that game intothe recesses
of the closet. V '

“That was a tough thing to
experience,” said Hardin.

Pantherette junior Brenda

also played a vital role. She and Lee
were the only Pitt _runners to place in
the.top 10. .

Goff said herbiggest problem is
teaching the Pitt runners to cope
with pre-meet nervousness. ‘

“Our team will grow with
experience, and then they will learn
how to mentally attack each race,”
Goff said, “but this is something
thatwill only come with time. Right
now, however, our team is healthy,
and practice is going very well, so we
have a lot to look‘ forward‘ to. ’ ’

determined by the free agent's
salary. The more he makes, the
higher or greater number of draft
choices go from the.team that signs
him to the team that loses him. The
March 1977 agreement superceded
the old Rozelle Rule, named after
Commissioner Pete Rozelle. He had
previously determined compensa-
tion when teams could not agree on

The NFL Players Association has
voiced some unhappiness over the
lack of player ‘movement or money
the players are receiving as a result
of the agreement—but it appears
unable to do anything about it until it
expires after the 1981 season.

Under the NBA’s 1976 agree-
ment, also court-approved, if two
teams can't agree on compensation,
NBA Commissioner Lawrence
O’Brien can award players, draft
choices, cash or a combination.

The compensation, the agree-
ment says, .“is not to serve as a
penalty but to insure that a team
which loses a player is, to the:
nearest extent possible, made
whole for the loss of . such

After gaining eligibility at Pitt this
season, Tissue - moved directly into

the starting front line as a left wing. .

Two games into Pitt’s schedule,
Tissue has emerged as one of the
keys in the Panther offense.

In the 3-2 loss to Akron, he scored
and assisted for a goal. ,In the
Panthers’ 4-0 victory over Bethany,
Tissue assisted on two goals.

“Jeff is deﬁnitely a good addition
to our squad,” said coach Leo
Bemis.
scoring goals, he certainly has the
capability of helping ‘us this year.
J eff is a good assist man, with speed,
skills and a good shot.”

What does Tissue think of his new
team here at Pitt?

“After seeing two games, I think
we will be a high-scoring team,
because so many people are capable
of scoring goals,” he said. “We
have good depth and play a slow,

patient game. We have a difficult "

schedule, but if we keep working
hard we have the chance to beat
anyone we play.” ‘

Baseball has fewer restrictions on
free-agent movement than the other
sports. But it, too,'is controlled by a’
bargaining agreement, with a
speciﬁc number of teams permitted
to bid for players on the open market,
a limit to the number of players a
team may sign based on the number
it loses to free agency, and draft
choices (albeit far less valuable than
football or basketball draft picks)
awarded to teams losing players.

Sheppard Leaves Flock

By the Associated Press

Center Gregg Sheppard said
yesterday he has refused to report to

the Pittsburgh Penguins training '

camp because of unhappiness over a
contract offer.

“I want to play this year, but not
under these conditions,” Sheppard
said in a telephone interview from

‘ Boston.

Sheppard, recently acquired from
the Boston Bruins in a three-team
trade that sent Pittsburgh's all-time
leading scorer, Jean Pronovost, to
Atlanta, said the Penguins have
offered himga two-year contract.

However, Penguin General
Manager Baz"Bastien said Monday“

that Sheppard was offered a
three-year contract.

“I know what other players are
getting and I have an idea what I’m
worth,” Sheppard said. “I’m not
asking for the moon. ~I just want my
fair market value.”

The 29-year-old Sheppard, a
six-year veteran with the National
Hockey League, is on the option year
of his contract with the Bruins.

“As far as I’m concerned
‘Sheppard has an obligation; a
committment, to play on this hockey
team for onesseason,” said Bastien.

“If he doesn't like the new deal
we offered him, he‘ still has the,last
year of his Boston

tions against Tulane and drew
praise from coach Larry Holton.

“Last year’s secondary was
individually better,” said Holton,
“but this secondary works better
collectively than that group. I feel.
very positively about the dedication
of the four people we have playing
there.”

Holton also explained that
moving Jeff Delaney from strong
safety to free safety was to take
advantage of his experience and
ability to react quickly to the ball.
Mike Balzer is more aggressive and
is therefore in a better position to
support against the run from the
strong safety spot.

“I don’t think our football team.
takes any opponent “lightly,” said
Sherrill, “because we have a young
team.”

"A score like 76-0 isn’t easy to
forget.
