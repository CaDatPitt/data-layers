" Nearly nine hundred high school
students, representing more than
seventy-ﬁve schools in Western
Pennsylvania. will gather in ‘Me-
morial Hall -Saturday to participate
in the University's tenth annual in-
terscholastic academic contest. Dr.
Barry C. -Mcliown, associate pro-
fessor of secondary education, heads
ah; committee in charge of the con-

Contests every year since. 1918
have‘ been sponsored in the: belief
that. the high ‘school and academy
students‘ who excel in academic.
studies should be -‘given the same
opportunity -for ‘ public competition
and 'recognition- as the pu' il athlete.-
‘_= ‘A number of.ch_ange.s1 ave been
madein the method of -administering
the contest, states Dr.- Mcliown.
Among. these is one favoring the
academically versati1e_’studen_t rather
than the one who is well-informed in
only one study. This year,-however,
Dr. McKown states, each contestant
will be required’ to take‘. a’ compre-
-hensive‘ test ' in _. English, mathematics
and the sciences. The rade which
the student makes’ in t is compre-
hensive test will .be averaged with
the result of-, hisspec-ial test, and the
final; average. of these. two grades
will determine the ‘standing of‘ the
contestants, . . g. "5 , «_ 

. The. _co.mpreh.ensive. test-.has'. been
devised by Dr.   ;D‘.-Sones, pro‘.-.
fessor of-__‘se'_condary education, and
Dr. Davidi ‘AP-.. Harry, _assistant_' pro-
fessor of educational" administration.

Dr. ormickt

' Professor H. S. Scribner,_profes-
sor of Greek, in the University, who
has taught under four chancellors:
Prof. Golf, Dr. Holland, Dr. Mc-
Cormick and , Chancellor Bowman,
will alwa s remember Dr. S. B. Mc-
Cormick or his vigor and kindness.
a Previous to Dr. McCormick’s chan-
cellorship, Dr. William J. Holland
had made the old Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania a university in
reality, one which was ‘taking its
place among the important institu-
tions of ‘higher learning in the
country by the affiliation of the four
professional schools of medicine,
pharmacy, dentistry and law.
Professor Scribner

“Good work was being done by
both faculty and students in the col-
lege of the university and in the
schools of engineering. With the
college I had been associated and had
served on the teaching for over ten
years, in -fact since 1890. Many of
the students of that period I count
among my best friends,-and they
have risen to high positions in their
several callings. The professional
schools were turning out graduates
who have since " become conspicious
in the life of Pittsburgh and of
iWestern Pennsylvania.

—“The research of Langley, Keeler,
and Brashear in astromny, of
Phillips, Holland, Fessenden, Carhart
and others in * pure and applied
science were making the name of the
university well known at home and

so abroad.

“When Dr. Holland resigned to
give his whole time to the great
work of organizing the Carnegie
Museum, there was an interregnun‘,
during which the scholastic aﬁairs of

‘the undergraduate schools were
wisely directed by Dr. Carhart and

: Dr. Brasliear in turn.

“Dr. McCormick, then president of
Goa College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

0 was invited to become the new chan-

cellor. The choice was a wise one.

Of Scotch-Irish descent and of pion-i ,

eer stock, Dr. McCormick was known‘
in Pittsburgh. He was coming back
to his own‘ people where he had been
brought up and educated, where he
had practiced and where later he had
enteredthe ministery. It was’ while
he was pastor of the Central Pres-
byterian Church of. Allegheny, that I
first became acquaintediwith him, in
fact we} were near neighbors. on
' Buena Vista street. This was, I think
in 1894.. - , a
“Dr. McCormick": energetic and
successful work in, building up Coe

College, and; his knowledge of the .

people in the Pittsburgh _district,
added to his varied experience‘ in
professional" and civic life seemed
topeminentlyf fit him for the her-
culean task‘ before. him.
“For_ several years: I had lost sight
of him, b_'ut_ when _I.', heard that he
was considering the offer of 1 becom-
ing ‘chancellor of the, old school. It
took it upon myself to write and
urge him to, accept the offer,‘ stating
what was doubtless well known to
him, that Pittsburgh was the great-
est spot in the whole country for the
upbuilding. of a great university‘; and
this prediction has proved to be cor-
rect; .
“Pitt students: may well. be. proud
of their Alma. _«Mater, and should
feel interested in its past history. It
will be worth while if you rive out

In the Oak- i A

Hall and State Hall were erected.
With the change of name to the
University of Pittsburgh a new era
began.

Shortly before the transfer some
improvements in the college cur-
riculum had been started and a de-
partment of psychology on modern
lines was inaugurated. Dr. McCor-
mick though a believer in the value
of the traditional college studies was
always interested in new aspects of
knowledge and the new psychology
especially appealed to him.

“With the change of name and lo-
cation, both chancellor and faculty
were for several‘ years engaged in
reorganizing the curriculum and in
adding new departments in keeping
withe the demands of a growing ur-
ban university. _
In this work the activity and. tire--
less energy of the chancellor were
always evident. The establishment
of two new schools, the School of
Education and the School of Econo-
mics (Now the School of Business
Administration), and of the Evening
School showed that Dr. McCormick
had a clear conception of the service
to the community which a university
could render. The. service which the

seems to have been the stron motive
which directed Dr. McCormic ’s ceas-
less labors for the cause of educa-
tion in our midst. ‘This service. for
the welfare of the people. is especial-
ly evident when‘ we come to know
the wide reaching work of our pro-
fessional schools. _
Dr. McCormick was of a very prac-
tical nature and had a keen feeling
for what appealed to the public
taste. He took great interest in
oratoricaI_ ahd debating’ contests of
the students. His ;training’ as a law-
yer and his constant experience as
a ulpit orator and a public speaker
led). him to emphasize the power of ‘
clear, accurate, and convincing pub-
lic speech. ' '

athletics and games’ and as. far as
possible supportedand directed uni-
versity athletics. Footb_all*especia1ly

appealed to him- -It was ﬁtting that
.he took an important ‘ part in .the_

dedicatory exercises of the. Pitt, S
dium. He was an_ enthusiastic at-,
tendant‘ at theball games in Forbes
Field andjelsewhere. Thi love of
sport he was able to indu go into
the last, and doubtless his regular
hours on the golf course helped to
keep him youngin‘. spirit during the
last years of his life.

“During the trying period ‘of the
great War and later, when there

—

:,yvas.more oi-.jless.~interruptioi_i in the

regular’ university work, the expan-
sion of, the unde-rgraduate~ depart-
ments on the campus made necessary
the erection of. a new building, for
lecture. and recitation purposes; The
Alumni , Association, I understand,
uiidertook the work of putting‘ up"
this needed, addition, and for many
years a monument to the devotion
andself‘-sacriﬁce of the sons of Pitt,
many of whom have passed their.

Heaping opprobrium: on. John. L.
Lewis for his conduct of the miners’
offense in the present coal contro-
versy, Pat V Toohey, secretary of
the Save the Union committee, urged
immediate acceptance of the insur-
gent program by both sides _as a

solution to the coal problez"n,;before '

members of the Liberal club last
Thursday.

Toohey claimed that the operators
have set about to “open shopize” the
coal industry and thus force the
miners to live an almost barbarian
existe'nce., ‘tThe Lewis regime has
steadily lost ground. for -the miner,
until he is -now powerless in any
struggle between operator and union.
Lewis has substituted the cry of

‘every man for himself’ for the old 0

union battle cry of ‘all for one and
one for all,’ ” declared Toohey. “In-
surgent leaders are unable to voice
their opinions in national conven-

tions because of coercion and intimi-

dation of the rank and ﬁle,” he
added. ’ ' »

He was very anxious for quick re-

sults, and in.his labors. for the uni-
versity he certainly’ accomplished a
great work in‘ a comparatively short

"space of time. '

“He had a kind_and, friendly spirit,

Writer Deplores Manner In Which
Alma Mater Was Sung Last Week
A lamentable tiling about the gen-
eral assembly Wednesday, when
Stephen Leaédckl spoke before one
of the largest, student audiences at
a University meeting in years, was
the manner in ‘which Alma Mater
was, sung at the close of the meet-
lng.

If Dr. Leacock judged the Univer-
sity by the singing of this’ hymn he
could not have received a very good
impression of the school nor could-
any one else. The song began well

singers lost interest or for some
other reason dragged their tones
and the orchestra got several, mea-
sures ahead. Attempting to help
this poor ending the orchestra struck

Holy Saturday

Rain beats on the roof of _the old church faster and faster. The
clustered lamps in the sanctuary ﬂutter as if they gleamed through
the mists of the storm. e stained glass windows are blotches of
led and blue,'twisted bits of saints and angels. And in the con-

- ietsional Father Dehart sits gazing out at the crowds that throng the

church and kneel in rows along the aisles. .

Large-breasted women in black with dark hats pressed tightly
Wet their white or drab hair bend over rosaries, mumbling prayers.
Shop girls in tlowered toques, limp from the rain, totter on high
heels along the aisles. A mother carries a sleeping baby in her
«arm as she moves out of the church. At the holy water font. she,
shﬂtrthe burden of its body, so that she can dip her ﬁngers into
the waist. The shadowof the confessionaldarkens the aisle where
men stand with their ﬁngers" between the leaves of prayer books.
l"ttlt6i"Dehart watching them,'wonders if they are thinking of Easter
communion or of the chocolate eggs and chickens that they must
buy at the drug store on their way home. For down the aisle near
tlusi-ail, 8 man kneels lighting candles before Mary's altar. He rises
and moves up the aisle where throngs pour into the church to kneel
and to rsvlewtheir sins. -- ,

Outside the rain beats monotonously as the voices in the con-
tpsslonal rise and fall with their petty burden of sins. Father Dehart
elous his eyes. . . '. Tomorrow‘ will be Easter. Tomorrow a spring
wind, sunshine, and the glory of Te Deums. Tonight the Rainfall of
men's sins.

'I'~;la_st'. ice crust’ was. edging the creek. I had. forgot that I

Wwas too old'to,‘ go-wading‘ in tight laced boots. I wanted to go, as I,

ﬂied ‘to with Billywhen the thaws came, and littlestreams rutted the
hilllide,--gndipill  muddy water into the creek. I wanted to feel
my: boots pressbtftxght againstthe shale in the rocky places, or sink -
Into old leaves" drifted between two rocks, or make muddy whirlpools
where the sand-beds. had piled up.

It was tenyears: since Bill Paltonavitch had shown me where

_-the pussywillowsi grew beside the‘ second ‘bridge. Spring had come,_

Iiirly that year, and the ground by’ the willows -had dried soonen than

‘Mull.’ Aftet we’-’hadl‘cut the ‘wands apd laid them neatly in bundles’

under’  ‘bridge-p,lanks_w'e raced each other pp to they dogwood patch‘;
,Bil,L,b¢,l't‘ ms‘ to the’ top} We climbed the ‘gummy trunks until‘ they’
h;ént'Tund_erf our’ weight, and their branches tangled in the branches
of the neitt;-.tree. ll '

Now‘ the dogwood» would begone; since then they had been cut
down to make more pasture room. But I knew that in the old place
beyond the bridge the pussy willows would be green and gray in‘
the thin March sunlight.

‘ I_ was going. alone to—day., The creek seemcdsmaller now, and
not',so"deep_; "even the place__where the birch trees" arched over the
yellow water. at the bend/‘seemed not so far away as it had seemed
to ten-year-old boys. “ ' ,= ‘ '

Bilkhsd’ never worn ‘bootsz We had laughed together then as
he.-had stePl’€tl out on the bank and the watervbubbled through the
welts of his father's, old pit‘ shoes. But Bill hadn’t cared. He, had.‘
been‘ eager to show me the. pussywillows. I‘had been standing in
raid-iﬂtfelm. throwing ﬂat stages. and watching them skip over that
Surface. Bill had been busy breaking off birch branches for poles
to. stir up water’ snakes. We liked to slap at them through the
water. They couldn't hurt when they struck their noses against
our heavy, uppers.

Now as I pushed slowly up the middle of the -stream where the
wataeflwal deepest, there was but one pair of ripples spreading fiom
‘onepair of boots. When Bill's shoes had splashed along with mine,
then had been more birds singing, and the quarry. beyond the
meadow had. sent back an echo to our shouts. But now I was-alone
with-the birds, and the echoing meadow. A /

Old man] Paltonavitch was always drunk. - That summer he.
lost his job, and Bill had togo to work in the junk yards. I used
to sit‘ under the cherry tree on the hill above the yards and watch
Bill’: blond slav hair move around the cranes and the piles of rust.
one hot afternoon I was waiting for Bill to Rnock,oﬂ’ and go to
supper. That evening we were to go for cat-tails. They grew high
up the creek. They grew high ‘and brown under the willows.

Bill was helping around the loading platform. I watched him
climb up the stay pole of the crane, a long chain slung over his
shoulder‘? Someone yelled at him, but I guessed it‘ was nothing
since -Bill did not answer and kept climbing. When he reached
the top he looked toward my cherry tree and" waved. Then he
turned and swung the loose end of the chain over the cables. from
the power house. Suddenly I saw blue ﬂame ﬂare from\ he spot
where the chain touched the cables. The throw was short. I can
itill hear Bill’: shriek. He swung loose from the pole and hung
for _a second in the air. Crackling ﬂames shot from his hair; ﬂames
shot from his shoe-tips. His feet jerked and kicked convulsively
like I manikin’s. Then the chain came loose and. Bill tumbled to
the top of the junk pile. I was afraid, and I ran home.

 broke oﬁ my own birch pole up in the shadows of the first
lliidge. The water in the creek was yellow and full of old’ leaves

and dried weeds. I pushed slowly up the middle of the stream where
the water was deepest and where there wasn’t so much sand. Some-

a

tithes the sun came through the thin clouds crowding across the sky.

It shone fresh and clean upon the old ice along the bank. I. was in
SID hurry: I hll all day to reach the second bridge and the hollow
when the willows grew. At. the bend where the water ran faster

' 8lId,sw'ept the creek bed clear of sand and leaves and waterlogged

stumps, it was easy to walk on the rocks that shone clear in the
sun when the water cleared. Once I stopped to poke some leaves

it! 9-llecurrcnt. From the tangle, a young snake, drawn by the
current. slid past my boots. There at the bend Bill used to throw

(Continued from ?age 1)

Dr. McCormick taught in Canons-
burg Academy and was also profes-
sor of Greek at Washington &. Jef-
ferson College until 1882. In 1832,
having as his preceptor in law his
uncle, Harry H. McCormick, United
States district attorney for Western
Pennsylvania, he was admitted to
the Allegheny County Bar and prac-
ticed law in Pittsburgh and in Den-
ver, Col., until 1887. In 1887, feel-
ing that his life should be given to
the ministry, rather than law, he
entered the Western Theological
Seminary at Pittsburgh, graduating
in 1890. While a student at the
‘seminary at various times he was
an instructor in the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.
‘,:“From 1890 until 1894 he was
tor of the Central church on the
.'orth Side. In 1894 he returned to
the West and was pastor of the First
Presbyterian church of Omaha until
1897, when he became president of
‘Coe College, continuing in that po-
sition until 1904.’ During his ad-
s’-ministration at Coe College it grew
from little more than a high school
into one of the leading colleges of
the state, Dr. McCormick being able
to‘ secure many friends in the East
--who helped him in building up its
financial. resources. Before return-
‘ing to Pittsburgh he was invited to
become resident of Pennsylvania
College or Women, of which Dr.
James Black, his mother’s cousin,
;&as the ﬁrst president.
Accepts Pitt Call
“In 1904 he accepted the call to
‘become Chancellor of the Western
University of Pennsylvania, located
at that time on Perrysville avenue,
rconsisting of the undergraduate de-
partment, the college, school of en-
gineering and mines with 43 stu-
dents having affiliated with it as the

V » result of the work of Dr. W. J. Hol-

land, former chancellor, the depart-
'ments of law, medicine, dentistry and
harmacy, the total enrollment at
t time being 819.
-' .‘‘On account of its location, the
[University was not well known and
held a rather insigniﬁcant place in
_‘tha minds of the people of Pitts-
burgh‘. It was Dr. McCormick’s pur-
 when he became Chancellor to
"secure a new and more advantageous
. location as soon as. possible and to
‘add other departments properly be-

‘ longing to a university, particularly,

8 a‘ school for the training of teachers.

at Coe College as well as in his Uni-

. “Dr”. McCormick, throughout his
entire administration, gave himself
tirelessly and unceasingly to the~ad-
vancernent of the cause of public as
well as higher education and was
for atime ‘a: member of the State
College -and lUniversity Council,

C_ which "wad: connected with the State

Seciires Schenley Land
.“'I'he work of securing a new lo-

1 cation‘ for the University was a dif-

ficult -.one,.,_, some believing that the
1 University‘; should become simply a

college and be removed ' from the .

city, others believing thatthe under-
graduate departments should be abol-
ished and even members of the

.. board were doubtful about the wis-

dom of this plan. In addition to

. other difficulties, the University had

no funds for the purchase of anew
site andptho erecting‘ of new build-

.‘,‘Immediately after coming to

‘ Pittsburgh, Dr. McCormick sought

to interest the commonwealth in the
work of the University and in‘ 1908
secured an appropriation, including
$175,000 for the erection of a build-
ing. ,. In order to secure payment of
this amount it was necessary to have
a; location. After considerable time
spent in considering sites, the Schen-
. ley Farms tract was secured and the
erection of buildings begun, in 1908.
State Hall, Thaw Hall, the Medical
and Dental buildings and Trees
gymnasium were erec-.c-.1 during the
next few years. At owe a new in-
terest on the part of ﬁne community
was; developed and the number of
students increased 1-api-ﬂy.
Growth Of the University
"‘A number of additions to the
faculty were made .u».d- the schools
of education and economics (now
business adi11in:ist;-uilon) were,organ-
‘ized.' A summer se.~—.-ion and also
an evening school were ‘added in
1907. Dr. McCormick was A also
greatly interestetl in athletics‘ and
the organized athletic activities of
the University began. when he- be-

A came Chancellor in 1904.

time

"‘In 1908* the trustees felt that the
name of the institution should be
more closely connected with the
community and it was changedfrorn
Western University of Pennsylvania
to,University of Pittsburgh. In 1913
Dr. McCormick recnrmnended the ac-
ceptance of the plan of. Robert Ken-
nedy Duncan, then connected with
the University of Kansas, for estab-
lishing a department of industrial
"chemical research in the University,
and the result was the founding of
the Mellon Institute, which has be-
come kn'own'thro.ughout the country
for its achievements in industrial
chemistry. ' '
“‘Dr. McCormick, having a robust
constitution and vigorous tempera-
ment, labored constantly to the full
“measure of his ability, both physi-
cal .and mental, to advance‘ the
interests of the_U—_nlversi'ty bY P1101113
address, by enlisting the 1nt_erest_of
individuals and by co—opc rating with
civic. movements. He was able not
only to add friends, out also to in-
‘crease the ﬁnancial resources of the
University during his ao.;ninistration
and to secure its rec ignition as one

‘of =the~'im'portant institutions of the.

country.

,‘.‘At the close of his 'administra-;
tion at the end of 1920, the Univer I

sity consisted of all the schools and
departments mentioned above, with

an enrollment of ovei 6,000 students

and 8 faculty of approximately 500.

the Pennsylvania Society of New
York, the Victoria Institute, Sons of
the American Revolution, a director
of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching from its
organization until his retirement in
1920, a director for many years of
the Western Theological Seminary,
and for a number of years one of
the electors of the Hall of Fame of
New York University and for twelve
years a director of the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce.

“He was a member of the commit-
tee of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church for the revision
of the confession of 'aith.

“He received the following honorary
degrees: doctor of divinity, Washing-
ton & Jefferson College, 1897; doc-
tor of laws, Washington & Jefferson
College, 1902, William and Mary
College, 1913, Allegheny "College,
1915, University of Pennsylvania,
1916, and University of Pittsburgh,

ber of the Duquesne Club, Univer-
sity Club, Phi Gamma Delta and
Omicron Delta Kappa fraternities,
also a member of the Montour
Heights and Longue Vue Country
clubs. He was a member of the
Masonic order. After his retirement
he was made an honorary member
of the College Presidents’ Associa-
tion of Pennsylvania.

Capacity For Friendship.

“With an unusual capacity for
friendship, it can be truly said of
hirri that almost everyone who knew
him was his friend and his death
will be mourned by a vast multitude.
Many owe their opportunity to se-
cure an education and advancement
in their callings to his help and en-
couragement. He was kindly in his
judgment of men and respected the
opinion of those who differed from
him, but fearless in his advocacy of
what he believed to be right.

“Constantly ﬁlled with enthusiasm
for the growth of the University,
he was not patient with indiffei-ence
or lack of interest in its welfare.
In all the discouragements of his
laborious work his greatest happi-
ness was to see it slowly but surely
make progress.

every interest with which he was
connected.

“Dr. McCormick is survived by
