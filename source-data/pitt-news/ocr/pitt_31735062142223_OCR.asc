E 8: M Students,
Faculty Picnic
At North Park

A stag picnic for students and
faculty of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines will take place this
afternoon at North Park.

The site is Deer Browse and
Harmar grove, opposite the swim-
ming pool at the park.

All Engineering and Mines
classes will be dismissed after
12:30 o’clock. Afternoon competi-
tive atheletics classes will also be
dismissed. Students with classes in

_ college or business administration

subjects must arrange with their
instructors to be dismissed. .

Three sets of inter-departmental
mushball games will begin at 2
o’clock. The winning department
will receive a prize. After the
mushball games, there will be
swimming and golf.

The individual students will be
responsible for any refreshments.

Owl Editors Announce Picture Schedules,
Amateur Photography Contest, and Theme

Friday will conclude the 1943 Owl
senior sales drive begun last week,
August Trovaioli and Robert Col-
ton, co—editors of what is expected
to be the last full sized yearbook
for the duration of the war, an-
nounced today. '

To assure all seniors, includ-
ing those here on military defer-

ments, a place in the yearbook,
Robert Sullivan, business man-
ager, stated that seniors may re-
serve their. copies when they
make the appointment for a pic-
ture sitting in the Owl ollice,.803

Don Lingenfelter, comptroller,
will be in the yearbook office from
1 until 2 :30 o’clock daily to schedule
picture sittings for those seniors
who will graduate from the summer
semester or who would have gradu-
ated this fall if they were not called
for military service.

Priorities and a shortage of
raw materials are forcing the
Owl staff to work at full speed
to get as much of the book com-
pleted as possible while mate-
rials are still available, Ed Rose,
publicity manager, states.

The makeup of the book which
has been nearly completed will

Rose said. Shown by means of par-
allel drawings the role of the Uni-
versity in the war is compared to
historical predecessors. Although
militaritistic in theme, the ﬁrst tri-
semester Owl does not subordinate
campus events.

All campus events will receive
full photographic coverage as
well as detailed writeups with
sections for all classes.

A sizeable library of photo-
graphs is being collected and soon a
contest will be started among Uni-
versity camera hobbyists to select

Naval Reserves
Need Engineers

The Navy department last week
issued an appeal for experienced
electrical engineers and for electri-

cal engineering students to apply L

for commissions in the Naval Re-'

serve. Men with training in the ﬁeld 

of electrical engineering are needed ,

immediately for duty as high fre-' 
quency radio officers and as power

engineers. _
Juniors and seniors in electrical

engineering colleges may also apply i! ii

for immediate commissioning.
They, however, will be allowed to
complete their schooling before
being called to active duty.

Information concerning this re. F, 
serve status may be obtained from ‘
the Oilice of Naval Oﬁicer Pro-‘ 

curement in the Keystone hotel.

Latest and perhaps the most signiﬁcant
‘admission of education’s shortcomings in pro-
.viding trained manpower in large numbers for
?the war effort comes from Chicago Univer-
'sity’s young, -progressive Robert Maynard
Hutchins. ‘

In an article in the Satevepost, August 15,
Hutchins points out that the present army-
navy-and-marine-reserve‘ plans grant defer-
ments to college students, together with giv-
ing them what appears to be better chances
of becoming officers, solely because they are
able to stay in college.

And in general, Hutchins shows, the factor
chieﬂy determining whether or not any given
individual gets to go to college is money,
rather than intelligence or ability.

So,‘ concludes Hutchins, the present ofﬁcer
selection program is undemocratic.

This -was the conclusion of a meeting of col-

lege presfidents held at Baltimore about a

month ago; ‘ I '
This was the conclusion.of a Pitt News edi-

. torial of August 4, wherein we urged further
state subsidization of education and further

state aidto. men wanting to go to college.
Wider in scope than the resolutions passed
by the college presidents in Baltimore, and
more pointed in its directness than the Pitt
Newseditorial, the Hutchins article says out-

he Hs Plan . . .

mean a better chance for a commission, then
this chance is to be open to those who have
the most money rather than the highest in-
telligence.” ‘

And Chicago University’s president has
formulated the Hutchins plan-—a blueprint
for wartime education — designed to over-
come the obvious failure of private enter-
prise education in the war effort. The whole
Hutchins article in the Satevepost is an ex-
planation of the plan. It should be read by
every student. The Hutchins plan is this:

1.. Abolish volunteering and competitive re-
cruiting—make Selective Service work as
it was planned to by implementing a war
man-power commission.

2. Lower the draft age to 18.

Modify all existing Reserve Commission
programs; pay reserve oﬂicers while they
are in school, thereby eliminating the un-
democratic principle that enables a boy
with a rich father to be in a college re-
serve plan while a son of a poor father
gets drafted. A

Admit to colleges and pay wages to eonug

young men and women to ﬁll the require-

. ments for officers, scientists and educated

industrial workers.
Instit.ute a two-year liberal-arts course,
designed ‘by colleges, before determining

I i right:

. . ., “in general collegiate

ﬁnancial status. If collegiate status is to
mean deferment, then economic status is to
mean deferment. If collegiate status is to

aptitudes. for special training. Drop those

status’ means

who have shown no special skills.

Require military training of all stude-nts.
Allow colleges to do that which they are
best prepared for . . . teaching.

“Where’s Jack Raley” was the
$64 questionon the night of the
Engineer’s dance. Some couples
thought he might have been towed

 away in one of the out of bounds

-cars the police conﬁscated. How-
ever, that is improbable since it
was still very early in the evening.
While she attended the ﬁrst six
weeks’ session, Louise S m i t h
turned down many a date bid—and
they were many. As soon as she
leaves the campus, though, she
turns up with Jack Foley at the
Pines. Either her ensign’s inﬂu-
ence is weakening or Jack’s Delt
air overcame her conscientious ob-
jections.
\Why is it that Herb Nicholas
trails around after Charley Egan’s

&

ex-women.“ First it was Maxine
Coffman and now Jana Friday. It
looks like Peggy Fixel is the only
trailing string left for Herb to
pick up.

It was “man bite dog” at the
Phi Gam house last Monday night
when t.he Fiji pledges turned on
Professor Howdy Updegraff and
forcibly deposited him in a cold
shower. When last seen, Howdy
was mutteri-ng, “I’ll get evrey one
of them sooner or later.” Maybe
under the “sooner” part will come
Bill Yokum who was last seen in a

huddle with the inspired pledges.

Abbie Steinkirchner spent three
successive nickels talking to Janet
Elliott the other night before he
thought to ask her to call him back.

The Second Front——

By AL -MAVRINAC
By this winter Russia may have

A fallen; she may then be dead. If the

promises of our leaders for a sec-
ond front meant what the people
were led to believe they meant, then
now is the time to redeem those
promises. The sands of time are run-

‘ ning out. Those sands will not wait.
. One thousand British and American.

- oops now are worth 10,000 Ameri-
can soldiers next spring or this win-
ter. If we ever meant to aid the
Russians, now is the moment.

But can we redeem our prom-
ises? What was the real nature of
these statements which we were
led to believe were promises?
They were either based on fact,
on a real and tangible strength of
arms, or they were propoganda
bulletins concocted for the con-
sumption of Americans and Rus-
sians—for morale purposes only.

But we cannot believe that one
of the greatest democratic leaders
oﬂall time would do such a perilous
thing as to issue promises for mor-
ale purposes only.

In time of war the people of a
democracy do not necessarily have
to be informed as to the actions of
their government. But no govern-
ment, even in time of war, has the
right to mislead that people.

I believe this to be one of the
fundamental principles upon which
the governments of a free people
are built. I believe that this prin-
ciple must be adhered to by a gov-
ernment in a democracy not only be-

-. ¢au‘se*.ofrst§‘e s.t}em0,©ratiic recosniiipn

.iPromise or Propaganda?

that a free people are more than
mere guinea pigs upon whom psy-
chological tests are to be made, but
that it must be adhered to for the
sake of the security of the govern-
ment itself.

The strength of a government in
a democracy increases or decreas-
es in proportion as the faith of
the common people in that govern-
ment increases or decreases.

In a democracy, the worth of the
individual and the dignity of his
spirit are valued more highly than
the cheap and baseless victories of
a propaganda machine. '

We would rather be uninformed
than be misled by our government,
for once betrayed by a govern-
ment the faith of a people in that
government is broken.

With my faith in the President of
the United States, I cannot believe
that we were misled. For that would
be perilous indeed. But I say that
if those promises are to be fulﬁlled,
they must be fulﬁlled now. This is
the day, this is the hour. Tomorrow
will be too late.

Each hour that Russia holds
out brings us one hour closer to
the moment when we can begin to
put into effect our planslfor a bet-
ter world for the common man.

The Alldred Room now has at
least twenty—ﬁve more good reasons
for students visiting it, this being
the number of new books recently
added to its collection. The new
books include the much discussed
last novel of Rachel Field, “And
Now Tomorrow,” and John Her-
sey’s “Men of Bataan,” the story of
General MacArthur and his gallant
group of ﬁghting men on Bataan.

Current events make up the sub-
ject matter for the majority of the
books. Hanson Baldwin writes on
the “Strategy for Victory,” while
James B. Reston takes up the sub-
ject of a “Prelude to Victory,” the
latter volume presenting an not
altogether cheerful picture of the
problems of morale that face us.

“Goodbye Japan” for former
newsman Joseph Newman attempts
to explain the philosophy behind
Japan’s dream of world conquest,
Simon Segal describes the “New
Order in Poland,” and Paul Hagen
writes on the question “Will Ger-
many Crack.”

Other books dealing with the
events of the present are “Relig-
ion in the Present Crisis” by John
Knox, “America in World Affairs”
by Allan Nevins, and W. M. Kip-
linger’s “Washington Is Like
That.”

For those who prefer more diver-
siﬁed reading the Alldred Room
offers “The World at My Finger
Tips” by Karsten Ohstad, the story
of a blind person; Charles Morris
Wilson’s “Ambassadors in White”
which had nothing at all to do with
diplomatic relations, but instead
concerns the problems of disease

SPORTS EDITOR

 

While the majority of the athletic directors are worrying
about the effects of the draft on their athletes, or the effect
of the rationing upon transportation, or, probably most impor-
tant of all, the results in the box-ofiice, ,Pitt’s Jimmy Hagan
is currently staying awake nights wondering where he is
going to get a few capable coaches.

Last Thursday afternoon, track coach Carl Olson received
his commission in the Navy as a Lieutenant-Commander, and
is expected to leave in three weeks. Previous to this, Forrest
Evashevski, backﬁeld coach of the footballers, and Ben Grady,
mentor of the swimming team, received a leave of absence
from the University and also enlisted in the Navy.

The track problem is, at the present time, most acute.
Up until last February, Olson had a very capable assistant in
genial Jimmy Potts, but, unfortunately for the University,
he left for an insurance ﬁrm. Thus, with the opening of the
cross-country season scheduled for next month, Hagan does
not have a coach nor an assistant coach.

What he plans to do is a mystery. The schedule is already
set, and the University will have to go through with their bar-
gain. But we doubt very much if a new man will be brought
in to coach. It will be practically any man in the athletic
department that is free from about three o’clock in the after-
noon until ﬁve, and has an automobile that will let him ride
around the course following the boys, not to mention an “X”
card.

Indoor and outdoor track is another question in the minds
of the athletic heads. It seems that the track, itself, needs a
great deal of improvement, especially after the baseball
season, and the Army War show. The performers also need
new. equipment, and now they need a new coach. We doubt

that the University will continue with a self-existing sport,

one that needs money to exist but does not draw any money

, at the box-office.

. practically out of running, in the

For the loss of Ben Grady a remedy has already been
found, and that is Gus Wilde, captain of the Panther swim-
ming team. Wilde is now instructing the engineers for their
competitive athletic program, but whether he will continue
during the winter as coach of the varsity is unknown. If he
does, it will present a rather delicate situation.

It is deﬁnite that there will be no replacement for Forrest
Evashevski. Coach Bowser and his staff are to do the best
they can without the services of a new man.

Probably the unsung hero of the whole athletic setup is
quiet, unassuming Howard Waite. Waite as trainer of the
Pitt teams has had more direct contact with the players than
anyone else. He was also notiﬁed early last week that he was

° accepted as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy. Chalk up

another worry for Hagan.

‘So, as a result of ‘the leaving of many coaches the Pitt
setup is indeﬁnite. No one knows how the teams will get to
their games, who will coach them, and, moreover, who will
be on the ﬁeld to participate. To make matters worse, Jimmy
Hagan was reported waiting for a commission in the Navy.

It’s quite a mess.

'.!‘henameonthedooro£the&ree-
ior’s ofﬁoe will be the only notice-

able change at Falk Elementary

school when it opens this fall. Miss
Esther Starks, who has taught at
Fall‘. since 1934, has been named
ﬂrector to succeed Dr. C. W. Wool-
Oock who now becomes assistant
to the director of the University
Extension at Pitt. But Miw Starks

plans to continue with Dr. Wool- ’

oockfs program.

And it is not an ordinary pro-
gram because Falk School is not
. an ordinary school. At this tui-
tion school located near Trees
Gym on Alliquippa street, new
methods of education are tested.
The students come from all parts '
I the city and are just “all-round
normal children, if any children are
normal,” remarked the digniﬁed

new head. From the nursery

through the eighth grade, the stu-
dents are considered as individuals.

“Control is developed within
ﬁe individual” claims Miss
Starks, “and the children are
iaught to respect each other as
well as their teachers.” This is
very necessary at Falk because
in one room there are so many
activities going on at. the same
time because each student is al-
lowed to progress according to
his ability and desires.

There is much freedom in the
turriculum although the basic sub-
ccts necessary later for admittance
to higher schools are required.

Besides the regular teaching
staff of 16, there are assistant
teachers in the lower . grades.-
These teachers, usually younger
women with little or no teaching
experience, work for a year
under the older teachers.

“It is just like internship for the

- ‘medical profession,” Miss Starks
..*”asserted. “But even with an assist-
ant. the teacher is kept busy every
‘minute so it is not a lazy—ma.n’s

job. Sometimes no two children in
thcroom are doing the same thing
so that the teacher has about 20
different tasks to supervise."

Yet it is fun for both teacher
and student and Miss Starks
says that the one outstanding
thing about the school is the joy-
dis attitude and the strong loyal-

“I’ve always enjoyed teaching

Starks taught at ‘Lincoln school, a.
part of Teachers college, Columbia
university; and at Buxton Country
