The days of free, unlimited

musical works are numbered.
Effective Jan. 1, l978, a revised
copyright and muscial royalty law

“Colleges to be hit hard. ”

will demand fees for the use of these
materials.

“Colleges and universities are
going to be_hit pretty hard,” said
Alden Bowen, student affairs
attorney. “The new law is going to
prevent professors and students
from freely reproducing materials
on a wholesale basis.”

This means professors will no
longer be permitted to copy large
amounts material to distribute to
their classes, unless they pay a
copyright fee for each copy.

“In addition, a royalty fee will
have to be paid for all music played
before a paying audience,” Bowen
said.

“The situation is unbelievable,”
said Bud Heaps, director of student
activities.

“In booking a concert, we now
will have to take into account the
amount of money required for the
royalty fees,” Heaps said. “The
expense of putting on concerts is
going to double. A concert costing
$8,000 will cost $16,000 next year,

Foerster Gives Views
eOn Oakland, University

A By JIM GEFSKY
Pitt News Staff Writer
Editor's Note: I This is the last in
a series of interviews with
Pittsburgh’s mayoral candidates.

The democratic candidate for
mayor is Thomas Foerster, current-
ly serving his third term as an
Allegheny County commissioner.

Question: What can you do as
mayor to alleviate Pitt’s budget
crisis? .

Foerster: There’s nothing I can
legally do, but I can use the moral
weight of the ofﬁce to get the

ecessary appropriations passed
(%"signed into law. 1 think the best

way to get that accomplished is for
me to go to Harrisburg after the
election is over and the General
Assembly is back in session, and
personally appeal to the governor
and the House and Senate leaders
to see if I can get them together at a
meeting and ﬁnd out how we can
resolve this very serious problem. I
intend to go to Harrisburg and do
anything and everything else
humanly possible to get Pitt the
necessary appropriations.

Q: Do you favor Pitt’s continued
physical expansion in Oakland?

F: I know of no plans that the
University has to expand, but if in
the past problems have arisen, I
think it’s due to Pitt’s own planners

because of the royalty payments
involved. '

“Our budget simply cannot
handle this additional expense,”
Heaps said. “We’re talking about
what can conceivably amount to
$25,000 in royalty fees alone.”

Asked what the future holds for
student programming, Heaps re-
plied, “We will be forced to cut back
on the numbers of, if not entirely
eliminate, name acts because the
royalty fees would be astronomical.

“We'll have to learn to break old
programing traditions,and to --
come more innovative with
design and style of our program

‘ .order to make more out of less,”

Heaps said.
Not only will the revised law
affect the programing of outside

, talent, but all university musical

organizations will be required to
pay royalty fees on any music they
perform less than 75 years old.
“However,” Heaps said, “The fee
is not required for musical
performances where no admission
is charged.”

According to Dr. Willaim Nasri,
professor at the Graduate School of
Library and Informational Sciences
(GSLIS), the revised law will make
people view information in a new
light. ’

“Our society is becoming more
and more information oriented,”
Nasri said. “Like any other
commodity, if you want informa-
tion, you must be willing to pay for

Foerster
Meets With
S.G.Members

By MAGGIE McKAY
Pitt News Staff writer

Democratic candidate Thomas
Foerster revealed last week he
intends to go to Harrisburg Nov. 14
to meet with state legislators on
Pitt’s appropriations.

In a meeting with members of the
Student Government Board Friday,
Foerster offered to help set up
interviews for them with key
legislators and to plan strategies for
those meetings. The SGB will also
travel to Harrisburg Nov. 14.

Fielding a number of questions
from SGB members Chip Hubbard,
Josh Baylson, and Dave Hesidence
and Intrafraternity Council presi-

Bill Said To

Harm GradJobOutlook

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Pitt News Staff Writer

Two bills recently passed by the
United States House and Senate,
and now in a _ joint conference
committee, may seriously affect
college graduates seeking jobs in

taking to the pathways and roadways of Schenley Park

I higher education and business. ».

The legislation would raise the
minimum required retirement age
from 65 years to 70 years. If
adopted, it could slow the rate at
which graduates enter the job
market .

Passing with only four “no”
votes, the House version makes no
exemptions for tenured professors,
administrators or executives in
educational institutions and in
private industry.

The Senate, however, added two
amendments that exempt from
mandatory retirement professors
and executives who earn $20,000
or more per year. These are the
Chafee and Pell amendments,
named after their sponsors.

Gustav Reinecki, Pitt’s chancel-
lot of human resources, said the bill
does not affect the University
because Pitt is ‘ ‘Already at the point
where the bill takes effect.”Pitt
professors are not required to retire
until age 70.

According to Louis Tronzo,
assistant‘director of Pitt’s Govern-

ment Relations Ofﬁce, “This bill
has some very bad implications on
society. It creates another lost
generation of jobless young peo-
ple.” Many educated people are
unable to ﬁnd jobs, he said and this
measure would make the situation
worse.

Tronzo said one reason the bill is
being passed is to make people pay
into Social Security for a longer
time.This will result in fewer
payments to retired persons..,,~w

The issue now is under debﬁg 

a conference committee. Hou e
members prefer a’ three-year delay
on the Chafee amendment.

Tronzo said the House would
agree to the Pell amendment, which
would affect Pitt administrators
whose retirement income is $30,000
or more.

The bill, also may have and
adverse effect on women and
minorities trying to move into
“upwardly mobile” jobs.

“The bill will be used as a legal
tool on the civil rights issue,” said
Tronzo. “The NAACP and Nat‘l§‘;"

President Carter to ask him not to
sign it. It would be a blessing if the

I measure were not enacted.”

The Student Government Com-
muter Committee serves as a voice
for some 65-85 percent of Pitt’s
student community.

The committee was initially set
established in December, 1976,
during the PAT BUS STRIKE. It
organized car pools as an altema-
tive means of transportation for
numerous stranded commuters. At
the last meeting of the Student
Assembly, Diane Behers and Gloria
Dorn were designated chairmen of
the committee.

Recent reports on commuters
point out the majority of the student
population here are commuters (the
University deﬁnes a commuter as
anyone not living in the dorms).

The University, realizing com-
muter needs have not been met, has
formed Special Students Services,
with Jack Hayes as director, to deal

 Commuters Seeking

.»i ._:

 Involvement Increase

with the growing problems of
commuters.

The Commuter Committee is now
establishing goals to more effective-
ly meet commuter needs . It plans to
survey commuters to learn what
commuters expect of it.

One of its objectives is more
involvment in University activities.
It would like to make other
committees and organizations
aware of the commuter’s plight.
Promoting activities in which
commuters can participate is also on
of its goals. Complaints regarding
bus service may be brought to the
committee and action will be taken.
It would like to have a day when Pitt
students could ride free, or for a
dime on ‘PAT buses.

The Commuter Committee will be
holding its next meeting Friday,
Nov. II, at l p,m. in the Student
Government conference room.

for not making‘ people more aware
ofjust what plans Pitt had in mind.

Q: What about special problem
areas, like fraternities?

F: Idon’t view this area as much
of a problem. The fraternities have
a right to be where they are, but I
would'fully support some type of
vehicle that could set up discus-
sions between fraternity leaders
and any neighbors over some of the
common problems that they each
face, or about the problems
between the neighbors and the

Qhaternities.

(.

Q: Do you have any thoughts as
to how security in the Oakland-Pitt
area can be improved?

F: I think security all over the
city is in a disasterous state. I
would immediately create 80 new
police slots to replace the police
ofﬁcers who are either off, on
disability or on compensation and
who are never going to be on duty
again. I would also provide the
leadership so as to be able to give
the police the equipment and
various other things they require to
successfully protect Pittsburgh.

Q: Is there any way you could
assure us of continued bus service,

e  not to repeat last winter’s bus

e?

F: I will interject myself using
the real or imagined prestiege of
the mayor’s ofﬁce to help negotiate
a successful conclusion to any labor
dispute. 1 have a moral, if not legal,
responsibility to do that.

Q: Do you favor any type of
rapid transit, or lowering of bus
fares?

F: I think that in the next 10
years public transportation will
have to be supported by the

ﬁxpayersiand not by the fare bo x.

/_

is

have proposed the formation of
the Southwestern Pennsylvania
Transit Authority, modeled after
Philadelphia’s SEPTA. This body
would conclude transit problems on
a six county basis. I also continue to
support rapidtransit lines such as
increased commuter rail service,
the spineline and the completion of
the East Patway. The taxbase of
this county however is not large
enough to support an overall rapid
transit system, at least not with a
real-estate tax base only.

Q: Whetjobopportnnltieewodd

la/ou create. "to Pitt
 ‘graduates m”n‘;dn ?

F: I would create an agency for
the city like the’-Industrial
Development Agency that the
county has. This ‘agency has
‘brought forth a half billion‘ dollars

worth of new industries, and this
includes all industries, not just
basic ones. I believe that with a
vehicle like this, Pittsburgh can be
properly merchandised all over
America, something that is neces-
sary to attract new industries and
thus new jobs.

lems and relationships of fraterni-
ties to the community.

Foerster promised that, if he is
elected, he will have one person on
his staff serve as a liason between
the mayor’s office and the students
in Pittsburgh’s eight colleges and
universities.

Foerster suggested all the area
schools formulate a joint report on
their economic impact in Pitts-
burgh, similar to the one the
University issued earlier this year.

“Oakland has to be one of the
best areas for a merchant to do
business in, because of the buying
power of the students,” Foerster
said.

Asked how students can helpthe
University to work better with the

city and the Oakland community, ’

Foerster said, “I see the student
body as a resource to help us sell
whatever plans the University
comes up with.”

In regard to the problems Pitt

fraternities have with their Bayard —

Street neighbors, Foerster said, “I
don’t view the problem as seriously
as other people on City Council do. I
‘Support your right to be there.”

Foerster said the city has a long
way to go in providing adequate
services to students. To remedy the
situation, he has proposed the
creation of a Commission of Public
Education in Pittsburgh.

“It could, in eﬁect, be a lobbying
tool for education,” Foerster said.
‘.‘We must improve the quality of

our schools and achieve a reputation_

as the best. Unless . we do

~ something drastic, we won’t be able
to attract young families to the
area.’.’ -

Copyright I.aw Imposes Fees

(Connnuedfrom Page I)

Nasri, an attorney and expert on
the new law, said the law provides
certain rights for the users of
copyrighted material as well as for
the creator.

“For too long, the scale had been
tipped to the extreme advantage of
the user of materials,”Nasri said,
“But "the writers and originators of
ideas must be given the incentives
to create. This law will attempt to
equalize the situation.”

Nasri said the new law is
complicated, and that it will take
time for the provisions to be clearly
deﬁned.

Asked if he believed the law will
be strictly enforced, Nasri replied,
“That will have to be seen; it will be
difﬁcult to do so.”

Penalties for violation of the law
include ﬁnes ranging from $250 to
$10,000 and possible payments to
the author or composer for the loss
of royalties.

Nasri added that, while the
University is not liable for any
copying done on unsupervised,
coin-operated machine, it must post
a message on each machine
warning that the user if caught
breaking the law is liable.

Nasri will conduct a one-day
workshop on the law Dec. 2 at
Stephen Foster Memorial. Regist-
ration for the workshop can made
through GSLIS.

University libraries will feel the
affect of the revised law.

“The law is going to be a
monstrous thing to cope with,” said
Assistand director of university
libraries William Neumann.

Under the law, the interlibrary
loan policy will be restricted.
Interlibrary loans enable libraries to
request, from other libraries,
articles from journals they do not
carry.J an. 1, libraries will be able to
duplicate publications for another
library only if publication occurred
during the past five years. In
addition, libraries will be able to
duplicate for another library, no
more than five copies of a journal
per year.

“Due to the limited funds of the
University, it will be necessary for

the libraries to concentrate their
purchases on materials that are
heavily used by the University
community,” Nasri said.

It will no longer be feasible to
bring journals that serve only a very
small segment,”he continued.
“There will be a positive side to
this, in that libraries will be forced

to reexamine their buying policies,
eliminate what is not needed and to
purchase with greater care,”Nasri
said.

Although fees for copyrighted
materials have not yet been

established, prices will be printed
on every copyrighted piece starting
next year.

Ed Bowers, chairmen of the Student Government Task Force on the Budget

Crisis, pleaded with students Friday to listen to his statements on Pitt’s budget
woes and Harrisburg’s delay in funding the 4-state reiated Universities. No

one, much to his dismay, seemed to listen.

Go Out And Vote  

Students, both resident and commuter, constitute a mostly silent
yet sizeable fraction of eligible voters. It is easy to be apolitical in
college; Pitt is close to, but not quite near, the real world of
taxation and making ends meet.

Yet most Pitt students eligible to choose Pittsburgh’s mayor
tomorrow will be out in the real world before his term expires.
That is why it is important they go out and choose a man best suited
to their needs—the needs of a young adult just entering the semi-
professional world.

All inolved agree that tomorrow’s race between Thomas Foerster
and Mayor Richard Caliguiri will be a close one. The block of
student votes, if cast sensibly can make a difference.

For Mayor-The Incumbent

Richard Caliguiri is already in office, with projects planned and
rolling.

When questioned by a Pitt News reporter about continued
physical expansion in the Oakland area, he pointed to a definite,
and it is hoped final, study of the area that he has commissioned.

Caliguiri is also a great believer in a second renaissance for the
city, one that will create Pittsburgh jobs for Pitt graduates.

On the other hand, Foerster, the Democratic machine candidate,
rhetorically talks of using the moral weight of the mayor’s office to
alleviate Pitt’s budget crisis and prevent bus strikes.

And the also-ran, Republican, Joseph Cosetti, doesn’t seem to
grasp the student perspective. When interviewed he was less direct
than Foerster and Calguiri.

Mayor Caliguiri has done well as interim mayor.
should be extended.

A Misleading Referendum  

His tenure

The so-called “Steel Referendum” has been explained, out of
context, as a choice between employment and clean’ air.

What an affirmative vote will be is a suggestion for county
leaders to lobby against present Federal clean air and water
standards. ’

The question is misleading; a decision in either direction can be
miscontrued.

__ The steel industry will take an ‘aye’ as a blank check from the
voters to continue blackmailing local and Federal governments
with the threat of a shutdown while adding soot to the air and
cyanide to the rivers. I

Environmentalists will hail a ‘nay’ as the go—ahead to slap
tougher controls on the industry and bring it to a depressed state
and shutdown.

The question is more complicated than a simple yes or no. It can
be twisted and misrepresented by propaganda on both sides.

Students should not vote on it.

  Letters To The Editor

Commuting Better Than You

Think

I have just finished reading what
seems to me a very biased picture of
the trials and tribulations of a
commuting student. According to
your article (“Commuters”Fifth
Ave. section of the Nov. 2nd issue of
The Pitt News):

l. Commuting is rough because
everyone has problems at home.

2. PAT buses run at large
intervals, are undependable and are
time consuming.

3. No one has any friends or social
life outside of the Pitt commiinity.

4. Commuters are anti-social.

I am a freshman and am sick to
death of being asked by resident
students such questions as:“You
mean you still live at home?” (I am
19), and “Why don’t you want to live
at school?” If I wanted to go away to
school I would’ve went to Penn
State. I speciﬁcally chose Pitt
because I live in Pittsburgh. Living
on campus has never entered my
mind.

I like my home and am quite
independent about what I do, where

‘Dead’ Head
Speaks Out

I'm somewhat amazed that
anyone could write such a poor
review of such a great hand. It’s
unfortunate that Philip Scalamogna
has what seems to be a total lack of
knowledge of the history of the
Dead and of its previous work. His
superficial treatment of /the cuts
included on this album comes
mighty close to being a travsty.
“Ripple,” “High Times,” etc.,
deserve better treatment than
being described ‘'‘’nice,’’ and
“having a good beat.”

are committing a crime. It is
unfortunate they even have consid-
ered placing jobs above the
condition of the skies.

And it seems they don’t realize
that, if the pollution controls are
waived, the jobs won't mean a
thing. Waiving the controls only
will bring about the situation
Pittsburgh has been faced with too

many times in the past; dangerously .

high pollution, smog alerts and the
reputation of the dirtiest city in
America.

No matter who is crying
Pittsburgh Renaissance, this city is
still associated with steel mills and
dirty skies. It is thought by
non-residents, to be a city covered
by a thinlﬁlm of smudge.

All the Goodyear blimp shots of
Three Rivers Stadium and the Point
Park fountain haven't done much to
change the image.

. But it's obvious to Pittsburghers,
at least, that the city has come a
long way since obtaining that
reputation. Pollution indices of the

present are signiﬁcantly diﬁerent

“Dark Star” is one of the classic
acid rock songs. Perhaps Scala-
mogna merely failed to notice the
lyrics of Robert Hunter and
Garcia's incredible guitar. Sufﬁce
it to say that the Dead are more
than just a rock and rollband and
Scalamogna has written another
lousy review.

from those of 10 years ago. A large
part of this improvement is due to
the pollution controls placed on the
steel corporations. I

An effective, afﬁrmative re-
sponse to the referendum could put
the city one large step backwards.

One small step for steel, one
giant leap for corporate control.

This in not a dramtic, alarmist
statement. It is a haunting reality,
which has been going on for the past
two decades. Corporations have a
tremendous amount of power in this
country, but showing them they can
control something as vital as
pollution standards would allow
corporations an iron grip that would
be difﬁcult to break.

Assuredly, all corporations would
love an affirmative public reply. It
would give them an idea of how
much social power they possess,
and how pressing their concerns are
to average citizens.

Thankfully. the issue is a
referendum, and the voting popu-

lace will have a chance to voice its

they are grown up and independent.

Here at home I have as much
independence as any girl could
want. Also, there’s so much going

there’s always something to do,
somewhere to go and people to

with a home-cooked meal and a hot

Of course I cannot speak for the
20,000 other commuters, but for
myself, commuting is worth every
penny spent on gas, every frantic
run to the bus stop and every
putdown by residents. I wouldn’t
have it any other way.

enough voters who will realize what

ago. ‘

Reader Quota Leviticus Against Homosexuals

 Perhaps homosexuality is a right

tit

WE.

granted to citizens by our illustri-
ous Constitution, but there is a
superior law that charges that
homosexuality is an abomination,
i.e. a moral sin.
Thou shalt not lie with mankind,
as with womankind: it is an
abomination. If a man also lie
with mankind, as he lieth with a
woman, both of them have com-
mitted an abomination: they
shall surely be put to death; their
blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus 18:22; 20:13

Such acts of homosexuality are
unnatural. How can any offspring
be produced if a man tries to have
coitus with another man, or a
woman with another woman? Sex
was made as a tool speciﬁcally for
reproduction, and, need it be said,

brought into this world only if a
man and a woman go to bed with
each other; otherwise it is
physically impossible.

Consider the famous anecdote in
Genesis: the story of Adam and
Eve. Eve was made from a rib of
Adam. They, the first worldly
persons, carried the responsibility
of populating the earth with their
sons and daughters. So they did;
and thus we have the ﬁrst
examples of human intercourse.

Had the Almighty intended for
man to lie with man, He would
have created two men, Adam and
Dave, or two women, Eve and
Linda. But He didn’t. Since a man
and a woman were the first two
people, it is clear that God frowns
upon homosexuality.

Nontheless, he gave mankind the
freedom of choice. Many have
chosen to follow the Devil’s path

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Certainly no issue today is
surrounded with as much heated
emotion as the controversy over
homosexual rights. Since the time
Anita Bryant raised the issue last
year, many misconceptions have
arisen that need clariﬁcation.

Charges brought against homo-
sexuals include they should not
teach because they would have an
adverse effect on children and they
are child molesters.

The defeat of legislation prohib-
iting sexual preference discrimin-
ation leads to preventing homo-
sexuals from obtaining basic
economic and human rights. They

can not obtain decent jobs or
housing, and are potential victims
of other discriminatory practices.

Clearly, I, like many others,
‘believe homosexuality is wrong and
cannot support the views of
homosexuals. Both Christianity
and Judaism condemn such behav-
ior. as written in the Bible.

However, religion is not, nor
should it be, part of the
issue.Bryant and her followers are a
greater detriment to society than
are the people she adamantly
dislikes.

The accusations of child moles-
ting and unprofessional job at-
titudes by homosexuals are not
true. Homosexuals can be found in

many occupations and they ap-
proach their work as professionally
as other people. _
Statistics show a homosexual
teacher would no more endanger a

W ‘N

K a /

child of the same sex than a
heterosexual teacher would endan-
ger a student of the opposite sex.
There is a small percentage of sick
homosexualsjust as there is a small
percentage of sick heterosexuals.

The furor raised over the danger
of homosexuals is propagated by
irrational people distorting the
facts. In any group there will be a
small minority who can easily give a
bad name to the entire organization.

Furthermore, who gives Bryant,
or anyone else for that matter, the
right or the authority to take away
rights to people that are to be
determined by the Constitution?
Bryant, especially with the tactics

5

,,_..,

she uses, is certainly not a qualified
legal authority.

Selecting biblical verses is a
backward and ridiculous way of
determining civil rights. That
practice has led to discrimination
against blacks and women, witch
burning, pogroms and religious
wars that slaughtered thousands of
people for no reason. ’

It must be emphasized this is not
a column of support for homosexual
beliefs and practices, rather it

supports the basic rights and ideals?‘

Prolonged Indian summer and
the usual ease-up in classes after
midterms combine to increase
student interest in athletics. Swing
your tennis racket now, for
tomorrow it may snow.

Tennis and jogging are particu-
larly popular and, with winter
creeping up, both can be moved
indoors. Skiing and skating are
true winter outdoors activities.

Actually, the student ﬁrst should

. focus on getting in shape. After a

couple of months of cramming "the
books and munching Fritos, that
quick set on the courts may just
send you to the emergency room
with a twisted ankle, or leave you in
pain for a week with tennis elbow.

One of the best ways to shape up
is a new exercise routine,
biotonics. Called “no time, no
sweat” exercises, biotonics are the
latest exercise fad to sweep the
country. Most can be done
inconspicuously, and strength is
built through a powerful muscle
contraction, held for a slow count of
six. Ideally, biotonics are done
daily for 12 weeks until stamina
and muscle control is developed,
then performed once a week to

A retain strength.

Since West Point recently began
to accept women as cadets,
exercises there had to be geared for
females. The program, regarded
as one of the best conditioning
programs in the world, guarantees
to slim, tone and build stamina. A
series of a dozen exercises, each
performed less than six times and
totaling 15 minutes, the West Point
ﬁtness program requires a doctor’s
supervision before it is embarked
on. .
Calisthenics is the timewom

traditional exercise program that
strikes terror into the heart (and
muscles) of all but the most
experienced ﬁtness freaks. Lump
into this category the usual
modiﬁed tortures, such as the
Royal Canadian Air Force ﬁtness
program, another big favorite with
doctors. These are the type of
exercises doctors usually hand out.

lncidently, if you decide to jump
right into tennis, you can protect
that elbow (and it’s easier to
protect than to cure tennis elbow)
by doing -this—use a two-handed
backhand stroke, switch to a lighter
racket, use lively tennis balls and
wear a band just below the elbow.

For all sports, make sure
equipment is in good condition,
and invest in a good pair of shoes

for anything from jogging to
hunting, as well as for tennis. It is
wise to take another person along
on your endeavors, as you never
know what you’ll meet up with.
Bicyclists and hunters also should
know the laws of their sport.

Pitt Students Shape Up With Biotonics .-

As all experts and athletes

agree, don’t try to play Olympic-
caliber sports your ﬁrst time out.
Build up gradually, starting with
exercises before beginning the
sport of your choice.

If all this seems ridiculous to

you, there is a lot to be said about
the merits of the armchair athlete,

Contact Attacks Hard To Hack

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Contact lenses,” claimed the
little blue and white booklet in the
opthalmologist’s waiting room,
“are fun.to wear.” Fun? Easier to
wear than glasses, perhaps, and

cosmetically better, but fun?
‘The little annoyances endured by
contact wearers depend on whether
one wears soft or hard lenses. The
biggest mess with soft contacts is
the cleaning process; generally,
soft lenses are pretty tame. They
don’t dislodge from the eye and,
because they ﬁt more closely, they
don’t catch dust or particles, which
lead to the hard lens “contact
attack.” This inevitably occurs
whenever one is in a situation like a
job interview or ﬁnal chem exam.
The “attack” victim will be moving

lens, causing excruciating pain. A
quick blink is necessary to clear out
the offending particle. Unfortuna-
tely, this remedy for a “contact

attack” brin s about a runn nose,

which calls for the use of a tissue.
Once again, Kleenex fuzzies ﬁll the
air.

It is a common misconception
that contacts always “fall out” of
the wearer’s eyes. True, a good
blink might cause the lens to pop
out, but this depends on the
individual. One sophomore ex-
plained that when she lost a lens
one night while on a movie date,
she calmly searched around in the
dim light until she found it. Then,

she placed it back in her eye.
Probably the greatest chance of
losing a lens takes place during the
insertion process. Many people are
"in the habit of putting their
contacts in while leaning over a
sink. This has obvious drawbacks,
as a freshman recalled. “I dropped
a contact down the drain of our
Towers bathroom sink. I didn't
think I’d ever get it back, but I
called the janitor anyway. After he
cleaned out all the junk from the

sink’s drainpipe, believe it or not,
he found my contact!” .

It is fairly easy to spot the rookie
lens-wearer (RLW) for these
reasons:

RLW’s walk around batting and
blinking their eyes in a manner
similar to that of a camel in a
sandstorm.

RLW’s seem to cast their eyes
downward in a humble gesture; in
reality, it’s simply that their eyes
feel a lot better in this position
during the “breaking-in” period.

RLW’s (notably female) carry
bottles of cleaning solution and
eye-drops with them everywhere,
even to racquetball class.

RLW’s stand in awe of veteran
lens-wearers, who can put in their
contacts while driving a car and can
ride roller-coasters without fear of
losing a lens.

Maybe by the time a person
becomes adept at surviving the
everyday traumas of lens mishaps,
contacts can be “fun to wear.”

Zappa Zaps Audience A t Arena

By CINDI EVAN GELISTA

“Pittsburgh, you're gonna get
tortured!" The crowd thundered
and applauded as Frank Zappa
opened up his concert Saturday at
the Stanley Theater with a
power-packed “Peaches ’N‘
Regalia.” His hair tied in a bun, he
took off his shirt, revealing a hairy
chest. The audience loved it.
“Zappa! Zappa!” they chanted.

Zappa ate up the admiration,
swiveling and rocking to the
frenzied beat of the drummer,
Terry Bozzio, who later, in an
interview, said, “You’ll never see a
drummer as good as me.”

He's right. During a solo, Bozzio
turned the audience on into some
heavy-duty drumming while the
rest of the band sat and watched
approvingly. Zappa lit up a
Winston and looked content watch-
ing Bozzio jam. There is no
competition between the members
of the group. Bozzio slowed the
beat, and Zappa and his band
spontaneously broke into a song
from Zappa’s newest album,
“Lather” (pronounced leather),
called, “California Flake,” a song
of incompetence, Zappa told the
audience.

“If anybody here has ever lived
in I_.A.. they'll know what I'm
talking about,” he said. “Don’t
bring your car to a garage in LA.
You’ll get it back with brakes that
don't work. and spend an
unbelievable amount of money for
nothing."

Zappa communicates well with
the audience. Early before the
show starts, he was shaking hands
and conversing with the fans.
During “Dinah Moe-Humm,” he
danced in an almost pornographic
way across the stage, and sang out
the chorus while gesturing to the
audience to sing along with him.
He grabbed the microphone, let his
hair down and pulsated with sexual
energy. The crowd responded
wildly, repeating over and over,
“Dinah Moe! Dinah Moe!”

Shucking the Mothers of Inven-
tion, Zappa has a new band.
Adrian Belew, on rhythm guitar, is
the lead singer in many of the
songs. Almost as zany as Zappa,
he pulled out a harmonica and did a
good imitation of Bob Dylan,
Patrick O’Hearn, on bass guitar,
follows up with an imitation of the
Who’s Peter Townsend. The only
thing wrong with its set-up was the‘
percussion department where Ed
Mann, dressed in yellow tights and

on

Frank Zappa and Adrian Bellew camp it up during one of their two shows last

Saturday night.

. Symphony Scores

With ‘Tristan’

By LYNNE L. MEYERS

Donald Johanos and the Pitts-
burgh Symphony performed an

unusual program this weekend. It
consisted of excerpts from one

opera—Wagner’s Tristan und
Isolde. The music was arranged to
include only music pertinent to the
character of Tristan and Isolde. The
soloists were Spass Wenkoff as
Tristan and Ingrid Bjoner as Isolde.

The trouble with concert perfor-
mances of opera excerpts is the lack
of context. In the case of Wagner's
Tristan und Isolde, two singers are
expected to dramatize a passionate,
suggestive love scene without the
background of the opera’s first act,
nearly 90 minutes of music and
drama that traces their first

meeting, their first kiss, and so. The
excerpts given in the concert were
the overture to the opera, the love
music from the middle of the second
act, the shepherd’s scene from the
beginning of the third act and the
Liebestod.

The tale of the unfortunate lover, I

Tristan and Isolde, combines
French and Celtic stories about
knightly honor and courtly love,
both of which have been violated.
Both the text and the music were
written by Wagner himself.
Wagner, was able to perform
Tristan und Isolde often and with
success, not the usual fate of a
resque opera in 1865, the height of
the Victorian era.

striped underwear. surfaced with a

PIa.V€d ”lCe1.V'~ not overshadowing
the rest of the group, and still
maintained a sound their own.
“Camarillo Brillo" followed
“Dinah Moe,“ and it is here,
during an instrumental, where
Zappa proved to the audience he is
one of the best guitar players in the
business, despite the obscene
antics that made him look like just
another crazy musician.

Suddenly he disappeared. The
crowd demanded an encore.

Zappa returns to play “Black
Napkins” with expertise, then the
lights turned on and the security
people ushered everyone out.

After the concert, in the dressing
room, Zappa and Company relaxed
and discussed the night’s ﬁrst
performance.

Zappa sat in a black leather chair
and said to this writer, “you got in
here because you got a nice face
and. . .” Laughter in the room.
There is truth to the rumor Zappa
is insane. The interview is
switched around as he points to this
snake—skin shoes and asks this
writer’s opinion of them.

“You killed a snake,” was the
reply.

“No, I didn‘t. They did,” he
said, caressing the heel.

“But indirectly, you did too; now
they have to kill another snake to
make new shoes ”

“No. . .this snake molted.”

Zappa is making a new movie,
called “Baby Nakes,” and the
band members walked around the
room singing “Baaay-beee
Snaaaayaaaakes. . . . ”

He claimed the star was Barbara
Streisand.

Zappa insisted on keeping the
subject of the movie a secret.

“I wanna be rude. . .its no fun if
you’re serious all the time.”
Finally, he adds, “But I will tell
you this, it's gonna be coming out
in the summertime.”

Is he the crazy maddog he
appears to be on stage?” “I’m a
regular guy. . .just a regular guy."

The band members lounge
around, munching from the table
spread with an array of cheeses.
meats. and fruit. Against the wall.
a plastic garbage can is filled with

ice, Michelob, and various types of’

wines.

It is true that Zappa is totally
against all types of drugs.
“They’re no good for you, that’s
all. . .I drink wine (he named a
French import, vintage 1961). . .”

Between practicing for concerts
and performing, Zappa wakes up at
8 a.m. “I shave, ride the airplane,
eat, sleep, ride an airplane, eat,
sleep, ride an airplane. . .”

Frank Zappa isn’t crazy, he just
likes to have a good time.

He sat on the ﬂoor to change the
strings on his Gibson guitar.
Pulling out packets of new strings
from a shoebox, Zappa had no
comment about Pittsburgh. “All
I've seen is my hotel room'(the

Carlton) and this room. So far I like ’

this room better. , .it’s more fun.”

Ferguson Repititious 
In New Album

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

Maynard Ferguson
New Vintage
Columbia

Maynard Ferguson’s latest
album, “New Vintage,” displays an
easygoing jazz style that is pleasing
to listen to. In most of the

selections, emphasis is placed on
the trumpet and saxophone; there is
occasional guitar work.

The first cut on the album, “Main
Title,” is a fast-paced jazz rendition
Steve Khan’s

of “Star Wars.”

 

crisp, sharp guitar work and Mike
Migliore’s lively alto sax stand out

in this song.

The next selection, “Oasis,”
displays a slow rhythm,
accompanied by Maynard

Ferguson’s rich, drawn-out ﬂugel-
horn. As the song progresses, Mark
Colby’s soprano sax takes over.
The last out on the ﬁrst side,
“Maria” (from “West Side
Story”), displays a bright, crisp

ﬂute solo by Bobby Militello, wl1r’,_ 3

mixes nicely with the trumpet work
and the easy beat.
The ﬁrst cut on the second side,
“El Vuelo,” is distinguished by

of King Marl, decides that Mark
should marry and give the French
Empire a queen. But, when he sees
the Irish beauty Isolde, who
patiently nursed him to recovery
from a war wound, Tristan cannot
resist the temptation to take her
form himself. King Mark is
mortiﬁed because Tristan has
broken of the code of honor, but is
powerless to stop him. Tristan and
Isolde then have an all-night
orgiastic love fest in the forest, I

{despite the fact that King Mark’s

. nd of knights are after Tristan for
his betrayal. After Tristan
unsucessfully battles the other

knights, he is fatally injured, and
Isolde, unwilling to leave Tristan,
dies soon afterward.

The message of this tale is that
earthly love is unattainable, and will
come only after death, thus the term
liebsted or “love-death. ’ ’

However, Tristan and Isold’s love
is purely physical.The weakness of
the basic premise is that it is limited
to only one kind of love, the purely
physical, and does not account for
chaste love in marriage or Platonic
love. Although the music and the
imagery of the poetry in the love
duet of the second act are sensuous,
there is little change from that mood

interesting sound.

The last cut on the album,
‘ ‘Airegin, ’ ’ is lively and fast-paced.
The sax and trumpet blend with Biff
Hannon’s piano to produce
an intriguing sound, different from
the rest of the album.

In sum, “New Vintage” is
rewarding to listen to. It shows the
talent of the band is brasswork.

However, throughout most of the _

album, the same patterns and
instruments are used.

a .

Don Mc Lean
Prime Time
Arlsta

In 1972, the career of Don
McLean skyrocketed with the
now-classic hit “American Pie,”
followed by another hit, ‘ ‘Vincent.’ ’
His basic folk-pop style and his
musical commentary seemed to be
an excellent comibination. But
McLean faded into apparent
oblivion after “American Pie.” No
doubt many people wonder what
had happened to him.

McLean is alive and well, as his
new album “Prime Time”
‘* ates. The singer’s use of satire
and humour makes the album
interesting. In addition, “Prime
Time” has one or two selections
that are ﬁne from a purely musical
standpoint.

The title track is about life in
America, or rather its problems,
and the general idea is summed up
in the lines “American Roulette is
the game we play. But no one wants
to be the one to pay.”

“Jump” is a lively, free and easy
p'ece with some ﬁne piano work by
 ie Wyeth. Dave Sanborn’s

  
  

., _,

-'IIVIy sax contributes to the total

sound.

McLean dabbles in bluegrass on
“Redwing” and “Down the Road/
Sally Ann,” displaying some good
banjo plucking.

“The Wrong Thing to Do,” “The
Pattern is Broken” (from the ﬁlm

good money makes good art.”).
The song is funny, but it also tells us
something very important.

“Building My Body” is a
humorous jab at weightlifting.
With a kind of fake emphasis and
excitement, McLean sings out the

’ lyrics, and they produce their effect.

   Vocals Offin ‘Tristan 1

during the entire opera, which lasts
nearly four-and-a-half hours.

The 90 minutes of the opera heard
in concert had both pleasant and
some awkward moments. Jo-
hanos’s orchestra sounded com-
petent and solid, with sweeping,
voluptuous strings right for Wag-
ner’ s ‘ ‘over-Romanticism. ” The
only balance problem was that the
orchestra was onstage at the same
level as the singers, instead of in an
orchestra pit; thus, the loud
entrances, especially in the brass,
were much too loud for the singers.

As for the singers, several
observers were miffed by their lack
of acting skills. They said that
Spass Wenkoff stood with hands at
sides like a statue at attention, and
did not attempt to gesture, swing
his arms, or do anything to sugggest
a love scene. Although Ingrid
Bjoner tried to animate the scene
with gestures, she received no
response from Wenkoff. This
deﬁciency was most exaggerated in
the love duet scene;the third act
parts were slightly better. Neither
singer’s voice was attractive-
Wenkoff’ s was a nondescript, high
baritone, and Bjoner’s was a high,
warbly soprano.

 Panthers Demolish ‘Rivals,’ 44-3 , 

ByJIMLEWIS

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.-—
The marvelous rivalry, the “Back-
yard Brawl,” the hard-driving,
close struggle between two an-
nually tough foes, never material-

ized Saturday, as Pitt devastated
the hapless West Virginia Moun-
taineers, 44-3.

WVU’s loud, rowdy fans, fans the
Panthers (7-1-1) worried would turn
an averagetgame into a war for

major bowl contention weren’t able

to make up for the Mountaineers’
(4-S). lack of talent and costly
mistakes.

“In fact, the crowd inspired our
players to play even harder,” Pitt
head coach Jackie Sherill claimed
after the constest. “But I can see

West Virginia’s situation; they had
an excellent team at the beginning
of the season, but when you'don’t
have depth, you can’t play college

football today—that’s what hap-

pened to WVU.”
It looked like nothing bad would

happen to the Mountaineers on
their first possession of the game.

West Virginia took possession from
its own 20-yard line, and matched
45 yards before stalling. Bill
McKenzie’s 45-yard ﬁeld goal was
good, and WVU jumped out in
front, 3-0; early in the first quarter.

And when the Pitt offense gained
a total of minus seven yards on its
ﬁrst chance, it looked as if it truly
would be a “Backyard Brawl.”

Then Panther safety Bob Jury
stepped in front of a Dan Kendra,
pass and ran 36 yards to the West
Virginia ﬁve yard line-—a big play
that, after Fred J aoobs’s four-yard
touchdown run two tries later, put
Pitt on top for good, 7-3, with 8:47
remaining in the first quarter.

A 10-point second period silenced
the vocal Morgantown crowd.
Faced with a ﬁrst and 39 after a
quarterback sack and a 15-yard ’
clipping penalty, Pitt signal caller
Matt Cavanaugh, went to work,
engineering a 13-play, 75-yard
touchdown drive, capped by his own
four-yard scoring dash that gave the
Panthers a 14-3 advantage midway
through the second quarter.

After Joe Gasparovic’s 51-yard
punt put West Virginia in a hole it’
couldn’t escape at its four yard line,
Mark Schubert gave Pitt a
two-touchdown lead with a 36-yard
field goal before the half ended.

The Mountaineers weren’t out of

t it as far as the score was concerned,
but the loss of Kendra in the second
quarter, due to injured ribs suffered
during a Panther sack, sat the
standout passer on the sidelines for
the rest of the match.

“The loss of Kendra deﬁnitely
hurt us,” WVU head_coach Frank
Cignetti said afterward. “Danny

Powerful; Pitt Routs Mountaineers 

(Continuedfrom Page 15)

Williams (Kendra’s replacement) is
a running quarterback, and it ’ s hard
to play catch-up football if you don’t
have your most effective passer in.”

That was evident in the start of
the third quarter when, after a West
Virginia drive died on the Pitt
41-yard line, fullback Elliot Walker
bulled over the goal line from two
yards out for another Panther
touchdown and a 24-7 lead.

Then, on the very next kickoff,
before anyone could catch their
disappointed breath, Mountaineer
running back Robert Alexander,
held to just 34 yards on the day,
fumbled the ballon his own 15-yard
line and Pitt regained possession-
thanks to Carlton Williamson's
recovery.

The Panthers went right to work
capitalizing on the WVU miscue.
Cavanaugh found Gordon Jones in
the end zone the very next play and
blooped a 15-yard touchdown pass
to the acrobatic wide receiver. It
was Cavanaugh’s 22nd touchdown
pass, breaking Dave Havern’s Pitt
mark of 21, and upping the rout to
31-7.

“Matt has improved each week, ”
Sherrill commented, “and he’s
doing things very few people in
college can do. He really took
offensively.”

Especially after WVU mistakes—-
which was the case in the fourth
quarter. The Mountaineers gained
control of the football after Pitt
place-kicker Dave Trout’s 38-yard

ﬁeld goal attempt failed; Williams
tried to pass West Virginia back into
the game.

But on his first pass after control,
Jury stepped in again to intercept
his second pass of the game, and
returned it 31 yards to the WVU
12-yard line. ‘

“This was Bob Jury’s best
football game,” Sherrill said.
“Today he relaxed and played like
Bob Jury can play. This was his best
football game.”

Two plays later, Cavanaugh fired
a 12-yard touchdown throw to tight
end Steve Gaustad, thus icing the
game with an insurmountable 38-3
lead and sending most of the 37,031

‘spectators away in disgust.

But Pitt wasn’t done. With Rick
Trocano replacing Cavanaugh, the
Panthers struck again after a
Mountaineer miscue.

Williams fumbled a pitch to one
of his backs once Pitt defensive
linesman Greg Meisner smashed
him to the turf, and Panther Steve
Clemons recovered on the West
Virginia 15-yard line. Ray
“Rooster” Jones rolled for a
seven-yard touchdown run two
plays later with 7:44 left in the
game, and Pitt had destroyed yet
another team by a huge score.

Cignetti, whose job is in danger
as far «as Mountaineer fans are
concerned after his squad’s fourth
consecutive loss (to Boston College,
Penn State, Villanova and Pitt) was
obviously disappointed in his
team’s performance.

“I felt that we could ﬁght and
hang in there,” he said. “But early
turnovers again were the big plays
that destroyed us.”

Sherrill agreed.

“Jury’s ﬁrst interception was the
big play of the game,” he said.
“Every time you have a big play like

 that, it changes the game around.”

What really changed the game
was the penalties—-or the abun-
dance of Pitt fouls. The Panthers
were penalized 15 times for 156
yards (compared to West Virginia’s
six times for 52 yards), causing

Sherrill to stride on the sideline‘s’¢‘“‘i

after officials, voicing his dis-
pleasure for their keen knack of
catching Pitt, but not WVU,
committing so many penalities.

“I really can't comment on that,”
Sherrill said of the abundance of
Panther fouls, “but Ithink you saw
my reactions on the sideline. When
it goes that many against you,
something’s wrong.”

Like calling a blowout a rivalry.

PANTHER NOTES: Cavanaugh
wasn’t the only quarterback to
break a record. Kendra became
West Virginia's leading career

passer with 4,472 yards (surpassin‘{;}'

Bernie Galiffa’s old mark) with the
49 yards passing he earned in the
brief time he played....Cignetti
claimed after the contest that Pitt
“has to rank up with the best teams
I’ve seen.” A conﬁdence-builder
for Panther fans who are hoping for
a major bowl bid.

‘ Cignetti Frank But Disappointment Shows

By STEVE SYBERT

Pitt News Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.——
Following his team’s 44-3 loss to the
Panthers, West Virginia coach
Frank Cignetti appeared undis-
turbed, even a bit philosophical, but
you could not help seeing through to
the disappointment felt Saturday as
the Mountaineers fell to their fourth
straight defeat.

Cignetti and the West Virginia
partisans felt even more frustration
in knowing they're only part of the
team that surprised Maryland 24-16
earlier in the season en route to a 4-1
record after ﬁve games. Plagued by
injuries, inexperience and a bit of
dissention, the Mountaineers were
just no match for the bowl-bound
Panthers.

Cignetti called Pitt “The best
team we have played all this year
and one of the best I have ever
seen,” adding the Panthers have
“dominant people on both offense
and defense who can make the big
plays.” The second-year mach also
felt Pitt was more versatile this
season than when Tony Dorsett
played.

When the Panthers arrived at
Mountaineer Field, they were met
with an echoing exuberance from

‘WVU fans, who were confident that

the passing of Dan Kendra and the
running of Robert Alexander would
lead the Mountaineers to victory.
“Offensively, we’re in as good of
shape as we could be with the
exception of Steve Lewis being
out,” Cignetti said before ~the
game. “When we started off the
year, I thought we'd have a pretty
good football team—barring some
disappointments. But injuries hurt
us and we found we didn’t come
along as well as we should have.”
The Mountaineers who have
played with as many as six or seven
starters sidelined at one time, again
felt the injury bug’s bite as Kendra
was forced to leave the game with
bruised ribs midway through the
second quarter. Whatever hopes
West Virginia had in making the
game a real contest weredashed

when Kendra was slammed to the
astroturf.

Kendra’s absence took away the
Mountaineer’s most valuable
dimension. Running backs Dave
Reily and Walter Easley have been
inconsistent, while the pre-season
promisesof Alexander have yet to
be fulﬁlled. But it was Kendra’s
passing arm that carried the

Mountaineers through the early
season triumphs, before injuries
contributed to WVU’s losing four
straight.

“When Kendra is in there, we

can throw the ball with effective-
ness,” said Cignetti about the
stellar quarterback, who surpassed
Bernie Galiffa’s WVU career
passing yardage record with his
ﬁrst completion of the game and
became the total offense leader with
the next one. “Williams (Kendra’s
replacement, Danny) is a running
quarterback and it is hard to play
catch-up football if you don’t have
your most effective passer in the
game.”

As expected, it was a very
physical game and Kendra wasn’t

WVU’s Robert Alexander (31) was highly recruited throughout the nation last
year, but the freshman from Charleston, W.Va. has failed to live up to all pre-
season predictions of stardom. seen here being crunched by the Pitt defense,

the only player to be injured.
Sherrill reported no injuries besides
the usual bumps and bruises, but
Cignetti’s report was not as good.

“We’re an awfully beat-up
football team,” he said. “We’ve
been playing hurt and with a lot of
pain, and there's no way you can
keep your defense out there so long
and expect them to hold a team like
Pitt.”

The Mountaineers, who will try to
rebound Saturday against a 1-6-1
Virginia Tech team in Morgantown,

didn’t think as highly of Pitt as their
coach. “They were good, but not as
good as the score shows,” sat}
co-captain Wayne Gatewood. ‘‘I
don’t think they’re the best team
we’ve played.” .

Linebacker Jeff Macerelli said
Pitt was not as physical as West
Virginia opponents Boston College
and Penn State, which downed the
Mountaineers by scores of 28-24
and 49-28 before last week’s 41-36
embarassment at the hands of
Villanova.

Hopes for Orange Bid

RALEIGH; N.C. (AP)--When
the bowl bids are handed out Nov.
19, Penn State is likely to be packing
its bags while North Carolina State
is waiting nervously by the mailbox.

Wolfpack cornerback Tommy
London and was alone at the

be switched. Across the ﬁeld, N.C. State

"Th€’."g3*'i‘U$3blC€P‘-ﬁg run for wasn't laughing, but it wasn't

our money." conceded a Penn State
lineman after the ninth-ranked
Nittany Lions came through in the
ﬁnal minute to pull off a 21-17
victory over the upset-minded
Wolfpack.

The win, eked out on an 11-yard
touchdown pass from Chuck Fusina
to Scott Fitzkee with 58 seconds left,
left Joe Paterno’s squad with an 8-1
record. And unless Temple can
produce next weekend what N.C.
State couldn’t, the Nittany Lions
will probably head to the Orange
Bowl next Jan. 1.

The Wolfpack, which has been
eliminated from the Atlantic Coast
Conference title race, is now 6-4
overall, and a team spokesman said
there is “an outside chance” that a
Peach or Tangerine bowl invitation
will be sent to Raleigh if coach Bo
Rein‘s team gets past Duke next
Saturday.

What saved the day for the
Nittany Lions Saturday was a play
called not from the bench, but on
the ﬁeld. Fusina, noting the
Wolfpack's man-for-man coverage,
decided to have Fitzkee do a flag
pattern instead of a slant through
the middle.

“I stopped back and yelled across
‘Flag,”’ Fusina recalled. “He
looked kinda puzzled, but when I
turned around to pass, anybody
could have thrown it in there.”
Fitzkee had gotten clear of

crying. either.

“Penn State has a lot of great
athletes who refuse to quit,” Roin
said after the game. “They had the
poise to march to two oome-from-
behind scores without making any
mistakes. But there were two great
teams out there today, and it took
the No. 9 team in the nation to beat
us.

Broncos Bust
Steelers, 21-7

DENVER (AP)——Rick Upchurch
returned ﬁve punts for a team-
record 167 yards, including an
87-yard scamper for a touchdown,
and Denver allowed Pittsburgh
across midﬁeld onlythree times in a
convincing 21-7 decision over the
game Sunday. -

The Broncos, boosting their
record to 7-1, raced to a 21-0
halftime edge after rookie Rob Lytle
ran 1 yard for a TD, Upchurch
brought the punt back the distance
and Craig Morton passed 20 yards
to a diving Haven Moses in the end
zone.

Upchurch, who tied an NFL
record with four punt returns for
touchdowns last season, ﬁelded a
line drive punt from Bobby Walden
late in the ﬁrst quarter, burst up the
middle and outraced the Steeler
defenders to the goal line.

SCORE BY QUARTERS

The 6-3, 245-lineman from Scott,
Pa, had every reason to be happy.
Plugging up the middle of a
defensive front wall that helped hold
the Moutaineer offense to 174 yards
in total offense, Boyarsky played
superbly.

“I’m really excited,” Boyarsky
said after the game. “We beat West
Virginia on its home ﬁeld. That’s
what’s really important.

“And,” the freshman continued,
“I was pretty happy with the way I
played. I think I read my blocks
better today than I had in previous
games.”

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill,
noting his defense probably had a
better game in Pitt’s disappointing
opening game loss to Notre Dame,
was happy with, the way Boyarsky
and the rest of his defense played
against West Virginia.

Boyd a Special Athlete

His slight, almost angular build doesn’t
give him the bearing of a record-breaking
athlete. When one looks at his loose—jointed
limbs a while longer, something sets him
apart. But at first glance, he doesn’t look
like any special sort of athlete.

But let Mel Boyd lace up a pair of track
shoes, ‘put on a pair of gym shorts, go to a
starters’ lane and run———suddenly, Boyd
becomes one of the finest long-distance
runners around, a runner of Olympic

proportions who, according to Pitt track and
cross country coach Mike Agostinella, has
“the talent to go as far as he wants to go.”
Although it is uncertain where his ability
will take the Panthers’ senior track and cross
country star after his career at Pitt ends next

 

spring, his talent has taken him places
before. Already, he’s broken a basketful of
records, including the Schenley Park course
record he set three weeks ago while running
for the Panther harriers in a dual meet with
Ohio State.

Boyd has so many records that he has lost
track of the marks he has set in the past three
years.

“Probably about six or eight in cross
country,” Boyd said. “Maybe about four or

five in the 5,000— and 10,000-meter runs in ‘

the indoor and outdoor (track) events.

“I really don’t know,” he added with a
laugh.

Boyd probably isn’t being immodest when
he says he doesn’t know. Agostinella, who
is pretty good at keeping note of such facts,
has a hard time when trying to recall exactly
what Boyd has accomplished at Pitt.

“Let me see,” A‘.g-ostinella said, before
listing the course records he knows Boyd has
broken. “Marshall, Ashland, our own
course record (Schenley)...Gee, I can’t keep
track of all of them. He’s broken so many.”

But records are unimportant to this
discussion about Boyd. What is significant
is that Boyd has done all these things, too
many to count, and hardly anyone has
noticed. True, record-breakers in track and
cross country don’t receive the recognition
of an athlete who cracks a record in
basketball, baseball or football, but Boyd
seems to deserve more credit than he has
gotten during the past few years.

Probably no other athlete follows as strict
a training schedule as Boyd. Occasional
joggers, note that Boyd runs from 15 to 20
miles a day, averages about 100 miles
weekly, and has run up to 140 miles in one
week.

Area newspapers certainly haven’t taken
notice of Boyd’s accomplishments, as a
quick check of the daily newspaper bears
out.

Fortunately,

the lack of recognition

doesn’t bother" Boyd. He runs for the sake

of running, not to satisfy his ego.

“I hate proving myself,” Boyd said. “If
you want publicity, you can get it in football
or basketball. Not in track. That’s for sure.

“I hate competition,” Boyd continued.
"‘I played basketball two years in (Ringgold)
high school. I know I had a good chance to
get a scholarship in basketball if I had played
my senior year, but I quit. It would have
been too much with track and everything
and I just didn’t enjoy it as much as I do
track.

“Yeah, I’m sure deep down it bothers
me,” Boyd said, “but I don’t get to the
point where I’m obsessed with a lack of
recognition.

I’d never want it to be that

way. I don’t want anything to interfere with By

my running. I enjoy it too much to let that
happen.”
Boyd has been concentrating these days on

. more important things than a lack of ink.

Right now,, he has set his sights on an all-
America berth on the national cross country
team. He could earn this by placing among
the top 25 runners in
championships at Washington State
University in Pullman Nov. 21.

He and teammate Dave McDonald are
expected to represent Pitt there.

“That would be icing on the cake as far as
I’m concerned,” Boyd said. “I’m trying my
hardest so, if I don’t make it, I at least know

I tried—that it wasn’t because of a lack o 5»

's

effort on my part.”

His future goals? The Olympics seem out
at this point.

Boyd thinks he lacks the attitude to make
it to Moscow in 1980; Agostinella points to
a lack of funds. ”

“I think I’m one notch below an Olympic
athlete, attitude—wise,” Boyd said, noting
that a runner doesn’t peak physically or
mentally until he is about 27. “I don’t think
there will be anything else for meto do. I’ve
been running for 10 years now, and I’ve

pretty much accomplished everything I’v,;i».,

wanted to do.”

Boyd, a Dean’s List student with a 3.5
QPA in physical education, would like to
coach track in the future, but he won’t be
heartbroken if he can’t. He believes in

g having diversified interests.

‘‘I think the real meaning of life is getting
meaning and purpose out of anything you
do,” Boyd said. “I couldn't stand the
thought of devoting all of my time to track.

...When you do that here, you are setting limits.

to what you can do both socially‘ and
academically-. I don’t want a situation like
that to happen. , g g '

‘‘I want to try a little bitiof everything.”

Publicityior no publicity, the world not
only needs more athletes like Mel Boyd; it
needs more people like him, too. .

Well, it-seems Michigan coach
Bo Schembechler didn't exactly hit
the nail on the head when he said a
few weeks back that there wouldn’t
be many four-and ﬁve-touchdown
romps in college football this
season.

vengeance this weekend, to wit:

forget...sixth-ranked Michigan 63,
Northwestern 20.

“We needed a game like this,”

Schembechler said. “It’s a great
morale booster. It's especially good
for our reserves. These kids bust
their necks all week and seldom get
to play.”.

While 11 of the top 12 teams in
The Associated Press ratings came
through with victories—No. 10
Texas A&M was idle—the week-
end’s top news was a couple of
national record-setting per-
formances and the ﬁlling of two
bowl berths, leaving only 24 to go.

. While top-ranked Texas trimmed
Houston 35-21 and moved another
stop closer to what apparently will
be a Southwest Conference show-
down with Texas A&M on Nov. 26,

runner-up Alabama nailed down its
sixth Southeastern Conference crow
in seven seasons after a year's
absence from the throne by
trouncing 18th-ranked Louisiana
State 24-3. The victory puts the
Crimson Tide into the Sugar Bowl as
the host team.

Meanwhile, Keith Thibodeaux
passed for 247 yards and scored
twice to lead Louisiana Tech over
Lamar 23-6, clincing the Southland
Conference championship and the
host berth in the Independence
Bowl.

One record was turned in by
Brigham Young quarterback Marc

Wilson, who passed for 571 yards

and five touchdowns as the
14-ranked Cougars whipped Utah

38-8. Wilson, who became a starter

when Giﬁord Nielson was injured,
completed 26 of 41 passes in erasing
the mark of 561 yards by Utah
State’s Tony Adams—also against
Utah—in 1972. T

Wilson also surpassed the NCAA
small college record of 568 set by

Bob Toledo of San Francisco State 11 __

1967. Ironically, also on Saturday,
Tom Stine of Central Methodist set
an NAIA record by passing for an
identical 571 yards in a 56-43
slugfest over Culver Stockton.

Young Stickwomen Doubled By Davis and Elkinss, 4-2

By SUE McFARLAND

The women’s ﬁeld hockey team
wrapped up its ill-fated season with
a 4-2 defeat at the hand of Davis
and Elkins Nov. 3.

Davis and Elkins stormed the
Pantherette inner circle early in the
ﬁrst half, making the score 1-0.

The count was evened to 1-1

‘jp’ midway through the ﬁrst half, with

a goal knocked in by freshman Gail
Karassik.

The half was brought to a close
with a pair of back-to-back goals by
Davis and Elkins, making the score
3-1.

Second-half scoring featured

early goal by Davis and Elkins and a .
comeback shot by senior Cindy
DiGiacoma, setting the ﬁnal score
at 4-2. DiGiacoma, the 1976 ﬁeld
hockey MVP and one of the team’s
leading scorers,” played her last
game in a Pantherette uniform.

Freshman Gail Karassik, right
inner from Kingston, Pa., was the
leading scorer on the 1977
Pantherette squad. “I’m really
looking forward to next season,
because I know we’ll do much
better than this year,” she said.

Head coach, Jannet McDowell

Pitt News Staff Writer

A pair of goals by Curt Hetz were
in vain Saturday as the Pitt Hockey
Club lost its season opener, 5-2, to
Bowling Green at Lake Vue.

Although the Panthers took an
early 1-0 lead and out-shot the
Bowling Green

pressure and was responsible for
the ﬁnal difference.

“Their goalie kept them in the
game,” Pitt head coach Len
Barcalow said, “because, I'll tell
you, our guys played their friggin
hearts out.”

After Hetz notched Pitt’s ﬁrst
goal of the season with little over a
minute played in the game, the
Panthers were overcome by
mistakes that led to the ﬁve Falcon

goals.
“We made mistakes, mistakes,

 mistakes,” Barcalow said, “and

you just can’t get away with that in
hockey. I don’t care if you're
playing Chinese hockey or if you’re

awesome -977 to the Panthers’ 794.
The Dukes had scores of 232, 210

and 208 to lead the way for the

highest score Pitt has seen in two
years.

Led by Haber’s 562 and Joseph's
524 Pitt received little or no support
from the re st of the Panthers in total
series pins. In addition, the Dukes
rolled a total series of 633 , 583 and
571, so the Panthers seem to have
caught them on a good day.

“We bowled pretty well today,”
Joseph said. “The Dukes had a
fantastic day, and, once again, we
were plagued with inconsistency.
Hopefully, we’ll rectify our incon-
sistency and throw some 900’s of
our own.”

up in Canada, you can’t make
mista es.

Pitt’s ﬁrst mistake came on an
elbowing penalty by Pitt defense-
man Bob Stein, setting up a Falcon
goal midway through the ﬁrst
period. Falcon Jim Allen slid the
puck past Pitt goalie Rich Cunning-
ham, who has played in Quebec and
who made his debut as the Panther
netminder with a disappointing
performance.

“Rich apologized to me after the
game,” Barcalow said, “but I'll
take the blame for the less. When
we win, the credit goes to the
players, since they’re the only ones
out there wearing the skates and
gloves, but when we lose, Itake the
blame.”

Bowling Green took the lead for
good lateinthe ﬁrst period on a goal
by Glenn Petit, and the Panthers
went to the locker room on the short
end_of a 2-1 margin.

Though the second stanza was
scoreless, it featured fast-moving,
hard-hitting hockey that typiﬁed the

c;',‘

said. “We moved the ball well and
worked well together. Looking at
today’s game in respect to the rest
of the season, I can really notice
improvement. To see things end in
an upswing as they did here today
is really very encouraging.”

Davis and Elkins dominated the
game offensively, with 18 shots at
goal to Pitt’s eight. Defensively,
junior Robin Brust had a busy day
in goal, with 13 saves for the
Pantherettes.

Pitt ﬁnished the year with a
disappointing season record of 0-7.
The Pantherettes had many close
games during the year.

“There were so many times this
year when we were so close to
winning but we still lost,” said
freshman Becky Martin. A former
high school all-American at Man-
heim Central High School, Martin
led her team to the 1976 PIAA
Championship, and was recruited
by Pitt for its 1977 team.

Field hockey was instituted into
the womens’ athletic program in
the spring of 1976. Becaue of its
late addition, recruiting for the 1976
season was poor. This caused a
shortage of experienced players on
the 1977 team.

“Of our 22 players, 14 are
freshmen,” McDowell said.

The Pantherettes enjoyed suc-
cess this year via the junior varsity
squad, which compiled a respect-

table 3-3 season record. It is quite
possible MCDowell may look to this
young squad next year for the
experienced players she needs.

entire game. This brand of play has
been Pitt’s trademark over the
years, so it seems Bowling Green
outplayed the Panthers at their own
game.

“They weren’t that good and we
weren’t that bad,” Barcalow
offered as consolation. “Again, it
was all the mistakes. We made ﬁve
mistakes and they scored ﬁve
goals.”

Two quick Falcon goals by Derric
Arzoomanian and Jim May made it
4-1 before Hetz, who sat out three
penalties in the contest, tallied his
second red-lighter and ended the
scoring for Pitt.

With the score at 4-2 and with ﬁve
minutes left to play, the Panthers
were far from out of it, but they
couldn't beat Bivins again and
Falcon -Dave Phiel added another
goal to make the ﬁnal score 5-2.

“There's no need for alarm,”
Barcalow promised after the game,

in reference to the rest of the '

season. “As soon as we iron out the
mistakes, we’ll be bombing people
before you know’ it.” '7

Wrong In Home Finale

By JOHNFINN
Pitt News Staff Writer

It was a day coach Mike Hebert.
and his Pantherette volleyball team
had been looking forward to for
some time. It was a day when Pitt
could do nothing wrong and Pitt’s
opponent—George Washington
University—could do nothing right.

As a result, Pitt, in its final home
match of the season, handily swept
George Washington in the best of
ﬁve matches Friday night.

In the ﬁrst game, many of George
Washington’s problems stemmed
from _poor serve reception. The
Colonials could not sustain an

‘offensive attack and fell, 15-4.

In that ﬁrst game, senior Sue
Hershelman reeled off a ﬂurry of
devastating serves to give Pitt an
insurmountable 12-2 lead.

In game two, the Pantherettes
spotted George Washington four
points before their offense got
rolling. Andy Pletz, Cindy
Chambers and Ingrid Mueller
combined on several solid blocks to
stall the Colonial offensive attack.

Meanwhile, Chambers, Pletz and
Mueller also added several power-
ful spikes and quick hits from the
middle to enable Pitt to emerge with
a 15-6 victory.

George Washington didn’t- pull
together until the third game, but
by then it was too late.

Once again, the Pantherettes
spotted the Colonials a three-point
lead before recovering to take the
lead. It was a seesaw battle in which
everyone saw action, and one the
Pantherettes managed to hold on to
for a 15-10 victory.

George Washington didn't pull
together until the third game, but
by then it was too late.

“We were very pleased with this

victory,” said assistant coach Bob '

Shaffer. “We were much more
aggressive as a team and We
showed a lot of improvement.”

George Washington entered the
game with a 20-6 record and a
pending bid to small college
regionals. Pitt raised its record to
20-11 with this victory,a nd just
about secured a bid to the Eastern
Regionals.

However, the Pantherettes must
perform well in their next two
matches to guarantee the playoff
bid.

Pitt will travel to University Park ‘

to play Penn State Tuesday and will
close out the season next Saturday
with a triangular watch against
Edinboro and Indiana (Pa.).
