Pitt police delay on crime alert

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Universitypolice issued a crime alert Monday
afternoon, more than 24 hours after a man
snuck into a Pitt student’s Oakland apartment
while she was_ sleeping and raped her.

Police Chief Tim Delaney said he waited
until almost 1 p.m. Monday to release an alert
about the 20-year—old’s rape, which occurred
between 5 and 7 a.m. Sunday, because local
media covered the event and it occurred off
campus, on Parkview Avenue. .

After a similar incident thisjuly, Pitt police
did not delay. They posted fliers on campus
buildings and on their website the same day
three unidentiﬁed men broke into a house
on Meyran Avenue and sexually assaulted a
woman who livedinside.

Delaney said the Pitt police department
does not have awritten policy dictating when-

to issue crime alerts, and it treats them on a
case—by-case basis. I l

“The moment that you create a template,
sure enough something is going to come along

‘ that isn’t in there,” he said.

The alert issued Monday listed the time of
the crime andthe location, but did not give a
description of the suspect, something that
surprised Delaney. -

“I thought that we duplicated what was on
the air,” he said. ’ ,

When deciding when to issue the alert,
Delaney and other Pitt officials considered
the incident’s distance from campus and the
lack o “imminent danger” to the student body,
Delaney said. a ’ 0 — N _

He said that by the time Pitt police found
out about the incident, the suspect had already
ﬂed. Because the public and the victim were
no longer in immediate danger, police shifted

I theirfocus toward catching the suspect. — .

“This is something that occurred, that we

ffhaveito-take our time, cover all of our angles

and catch this guy,” Delaney said. 0

He said that on Sunday, details of the in-
cident had dispersed through various media
sources before he had all of the facts.

“What the heck am I going to report?” he
said. “It is all over TV, all over radio, all over‘
the Internet.” .

He also encouraged anyone with informa-
tion related to the incident to come forward
to either Pitt police or city police.

City police are leading the investigation.

-They are searching for a muscular black
man between 5 feet _8 inches and 5 feet 9 inches
tall, spokeswoman Diane Richard said in an

e—mail. The man was last seen wearing a ban- -
dana, skull cap or possibly pantyhose covering .

his face. .
Richard said that anyone with information

about the incident should call the Sexual As— .
sault and Family Crisis Unit at 412-323-7141 or

the Major Crimes Unitat 412-3230-7800. V

Student councilmeets at Pitt

Leaders from Pittsburgh’s major universities discuss policies, new student coalition

Drew Singer
Senior Staﬁ Writer

For those who love to follow student
politics, Nordy’s Place was a proverbial
who’s who of the city’s student leaders
last night.

Think “The Avengers,” or wrestling’s
“Four Horsemen.” Remember when]ohn-
ny Cash teamed up with Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristoffer-
son? It’s that big. We’re talking about

the Miami Heat of student governments, g

here. V _

The group calls itself the Pittsburgh
Student Government Council. It consists
of leaders from 10 Pittsburgh student
governments. Last night’s meeting was
the group’s first at Pitt. .

First on the agenda: creating an engag-
ing and effective website.

“I’m happy to volunteer our resources
toward building awebsite,” Pitt Student
Government Board President Charlie
Shull said. “But a new board comes in
December, and I can’t speak for them.”

After watching his colleagues sweat
it out, Carnegie Mellon’s representative
grabbed a microphone. ‘

“I’m sure we can com.e up with
something,” Jon Kowalski said. “We’re
CMU.” V

“Right, didn’t'you invent the 'iPhone
software?” Duquesne’s James Regar
asked. ’

A “Well, not me personally, but yeah.”

The folks from Pitt, Point Park,
Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon, Carlow and
Pitt’s Graduate and Professional Student
Assembly —— Chatham’s representative
was absent — also addressed the group’s
main purpose of creating a larger student
presence in the city and state govern-
ment. _

The group will meet with City Council
members after one of the Council’s weekly
meetings next month. “

Together they intend to start a stu-
dent commission that consults directly
with the Council. Members of the student
commission would be appointed by City
Council and likely consist of non-PSGC
members. '

Shull and other leaders said keeping
the student commission separate from
the PSGC is vital to protecting students’
interestsbecause commission members
would be Council—appointed, making it
difficult for them to -oppose the city dur-
ing a conﬂict. , -

They also discussed the continuing
woes of South Side residents, who have
had several run—ins with rowdy students
as of ‘late. .

“I’m not trying to sound like an old
man, but it’s obnoxious,” Shull said. “I
refuse to go there myself.”

Shull added that the high density of
bars on Carson Street doesn’t make re-
solving the problem any easier.

At the meeting’s 60-minute mark,
the group switched to discussing state
governmental relations, in particular the
looming Port Authority route cuts.

-GPSA president Nila Devanath sug-
gested sending students to Harrisburg to
lobby the state for more transit help.

The group did not make a formal deci-
sion about the transit-funding crisis. Its
next meeting will be in late October. I

ACLU    
recalls G—20
Summit

Tegan Hanlon
For The Pitt News

Nearly one year after the G-20 Summit
turned campus upside down, the Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union hosted a discussion on
protester rights last night at the Wight-
man School in Squirrel Hill.

Attorney Glen Downey, who defended
a number of students arrested during
the summit and “bike girl” Lauren Was-
son, led the talk. Much of the conver-
sation proved to be critical of police
behavior during the tempestuous two-
day event.

An estimated 4,500 people partici-
pated in protests during the summit,
culminating in nearly $50,000 worth of

For The Pitt News

The University Bean, a temporary food
and beverage cart, is scheduledto be
packed away by Oct. 15 for the reopen-
ing of the newly renovated Cup 81 Chaucer
Café. ; ’

Located on the ground ﬂoor of Hill-
man Library, the look of the new café area
remains a mystery because the remodel-
ing site is sealed off by floor-to-ceiling
white sheets. An advertisement for the

new eatery exhibits what students, staff A

and faculty may look forward to.

The renovations boast more seating
and a larger menu. ‘

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said that

' renovations would include new wall and
floor finishes, new furniture, electrical.

outlets and free wireless service. There
will also be a new raised stage area for
small performances. . ,

The remodeling leaves limited space
for studying. The renovation plans moved
library materials and bookcases included
in the old Cup & Chaucer design to else-
where in the library. The lack of tables
and seating for students to complete their
work could cause future problems, but
as ‘of right now, Fedele said no problems
have been reported.‘ p

dele said. He also said the temporary Uni-

the nation made more than 200 arrests,

many of which are currently still in 4

court, Downey said. ,
Failure to disperse was the most
common offense, though some people
were charged with felony offenses.
Many who attended the meeting said
they were confused as to how police se-
lected people’s charges and how courts
chose their sentences. Others said they

felt overwhelmedgby the police pres-
ence.

Last night, the ACLU discussed strat
egies that could have made interaction

between police and protesters less con-

frontational. V

Downey said that a study conducted
in Europe showed thatprotesters are
more likely to clash with police when
the police force is decked in full riot
gear, as they were some nights sur-

Barb Feige, ACLU deputy director,
summed up the meeting’s goal.

“The purpose of our discussions is

people with a chance to talk and learn
from each other,” she said.

crime alerts

Being alerted more than 24 hours after
a rape and home invasion occur close to
campus is being alerted more than 24
hours too late.

A crime alert detailing the rape of
a 2Q—year—old female student and the
invasion of her apartment on Parkview
Avenue Sunday was posted on the Pitt
police website yesterday sometime be-
tween 11:40 a.m. and 1:20 p.m. At the
time, the alert contained no description
of the suspect, for whom police are still
searching. The University didn’t release
an Emergency Notiﬁcation System alert
either. '

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney argued
that the delay in notiﬁcation was appro-
priate because local media covered the
event and it occurred off campus.

We disagree. ’

We believe that students should be

informed within hours -— not days -

Students have need for speedy

when violent crimes occur in Oakland,
especially when a suspect is still on the
loose. '

Pitt police posted ﬂiers across cam-

-pus last September, when a student was _
4 assaulted outside Bouquet Gardens. We

understand that Bouquet Gardens is on

‘. campus and Parkview Avenue is not. But
given the fact that many students live in '

or walk through South Oakland, we see
no reason why this week’s assault should
be treated any differently.

When students know that a crime oc-
curred, theylcan take precautions to in-
crease their own safety, possibly reducing
further crime.

Students need to be made aware of
potential dangers in an efficient manner.
And because we doubt all students com-
pulsively check the Pitt police website for
crime alerts, we feel an ENS alert would
have been justiﬁed in this situation. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

This letter is in response to The Pitt
News article “Pitt shuttles offer wild
weekend.”

I’m sure that most students have al-
ready been on the 10A at least several
times after their first year at Pitt, and
most freshmen probably get acquainted
with it intheir ﬁrst few weeks.

Is it then really necessary to have
a feature article about the party bus?
Really? ~ -

Maybe TPN can get on the 10A on a
Tuesday morning or Wednesday after-
noon and stereotype the passengers to
the paper’s delight. '

Maybe TPN could ask passengers how
they feel about the quality of the Pitt
shuttle system.

Maybe TPN could ask them if it needs
to be expanded.

Or maybe even conduct a poll about
walking and busing to and from upper
campus?

Oh well, who cares about any of these
issues anyways, right?

There is merit, however, in writing
aboutthe party bus. ,

There are myriad observations to be
made and questions to be asked.

Unfortunately TPN makes none of
these and fails to ask a single interesting
or inspired question.

Were any of these students under
age? .

Perhaps the paper could have men-
tioned something about underage alco-
hol consumption at Pitt.

TPN’s only mention of the driver is
him telling the kids to shut up and sit
down (more or less) a la elementary
school. '

Maybe she could have interviewed the
driver and asked his opinion on driving
around a party bus. <

These are just a few suggestions.

Instead of asking any new questions
or making original insights, TPN simply
regurgitates what anyone who has been
on the 10A during the weekend already
knows.

TUE_S_I_)AYS WITH MOLLY

Molly Green
Columnist

 

Beginning withjohn Quincy Adams, whom
I will always remember as the president
who enjoyed swimming nude in the Po-
tomac River — thanks, “The American‘
Pageant” — political dynasties have ﬂour-
ished in the United States. »

_ Naturally, there are the Kennedys, the
Roosevelts, the Rockefellers, theBushes
and the Clintons, butalso the Longs of
Louisiana, the Byrds of Virginia, the Dodds
of Connecticut and the Tafts of Ohio, to
name just a few.

* Likewise, the entertainment industry
also has a storied history of noteworthy
nepotism: the Coppolas, the Redgrave/
Richardsons, the Barrymores, the Car-
radines, the Sutherlands and, of course,
Thora Birch’s parents, who met on the set
of “Deep Throat” and without whom, there
would be no “Ghost World” and thus, no
reason to live.

These days, there’s a shiny new batch
of inherited Hollywood favoritism ready

to imprint its excessively glittery image '

on a society hungry for the progeny of

washed-up has—beens — and thank god, '

lest the world never know Miley Cyrus
and her impressive contributions to film
and music._

For many years, the political and enter-
tainment dynasties passed from parent to

‘child, sibling to sibling and Woody Allen to

comeback~Woody Allen seamlessly, like a
cherished family recipe — a classic Ameri-
can tradition, akin to pie eating contests
and wearing fanny packs.

Recently, however, something has
changed: There has been a fusion of dy-
nasties. Gone are the simple days when
politicians’ sons became politicians and
actresses’ daughters became actresses.
Suddenly, children of politicians want to
be on TV and children of actors want to
go into politics. ‘ ‘ j

I Just look at Bristol Palin, who joined this
fall’s cast of “Dancing With the Stars.”

Instead of taking the easy way out by.
following in mother Sarah’s footsteps,
Bristol willendure the rigors of being
paid to dance on national television with
Maksim Chmerkovskiy or some other at-
tractive male dancer. ‘ '

And this is not an isolated trend: Patti
Blagojevich, wife of former Illinois Gov.

Rod ‘Blagojevich, appeared on “I’m a

Celebrity  Get Me Out of Here!,” and

most recently, Meghan McCain has hinted
that she has a television gig in the works,
though she claims, “I would never do a
reality show, ever,” according to The New
York Times. ‘

While this trend is startling — where
will we ﬁnd our politiciansof the future?
Will Miley Cyrus realize her true calling?

——~ I hardly think it’s surprising, especially ,
I when you consider that politics basically
' is acting. Nevertheless, there are many

people in this country who fear dynasties
and their so—called elitism.

I am not one of those people. I whole-
heartedly embrace dynasties, mostly.be-
cause I am actually a descendant of one
— maybe even the greatest one.

The Green dynasty is pretty ancient.
My family is famous for inventing the color
green, which we discovered after acciden-
tally spilling a seriously ahead—of—_its—time
blue—raspberry Slurpee on some pineapple
slices about a million years ago.

We also invented every energy-efﬁ~
cient practice and custom you can think
of, which is why they refer to such things
as “green” technology.

Oh, and we also invented jealousy —— .

not that there’s much for us to be jealous

of considering all the sweet stuff we’ve

Political, acting dynasties fuse to create superthreat

contributed to the world.

Considering these facts, I feel like the
single greatest gift I can give to society is
to go where no person has gone before: to
create a triple—dynasty fusion — that is,
to marry the product of a political—acting

' dynasty, thus creating the triple—threat

political-acting-color-inventing dynasty,
which is a truly powerful combination.

After examining my options, I’ve set-
tled on Patrick Schwarzenegger ——~ son of
actor and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Maria Shriver, of Kennedy lineage.
Already, Patrick has a promising acting
career after “starring” as Jock Kid Game
No. 3-in “The Benchwarmers.” And with
his ties to politics and Mr. Universe com-
petitions and my ties to one of the seven
colors of the rainbow, we would become
the most unstoppable power—couple on
Earth, no doubt merging into some kind
of “Power Rangers”—esque super-machine,
accountable to no one.

Because if I learned anything from “The
Great Gatsby,” it’s that nepotism is the real
American Dream, and self-made fortunes
only leave you face—down dead in a swim-
ming pool.

When people think opera, they think big
voices, big costumes and a big stage. But for
the directors of Pittsburgh’s unconventional
new Microscopic Opera Company, these are A
the aspects of performance farthest from
consideration.

‘ The Microscopic Opera Company is
the brainchild of co—artistic directors and
longtime colleagues Andres Cladera and
Erica Olden. It was founded in 2009 and
has stayed true to its founding goal of pro-
ducing intimate, contemporary English-
language operas, performed by ﬂourishing
local musicians. ‘

As opposed to the grandiose spectacle
most companies employ, The Microscopic
Opera uses a compact theater space and a
small 10-piece orchestra.

“We like to bring our audiences really

This cozy atmosphere, paired with an
increased emphasis on theatrical elements,
ensures the company is set apart from the
Pittsburgh Opera and the Opera Theater.

In the interests of narrative, Cladera
and Olden seek out directors who can make
stories on a page shine as brightly as songs
do. Not coincidentally, both pieces featured
this month — the one-act chamber operas
“The Monkey’s Paw” and “Happy Garden of
Life” ——— ﬁnd their roots in literature. Sati-
rist Kurt Vonnegut’s short story “2BR02B” A
is the source material for composer Ka-
tarzyna Brochocka’s “Happy Garden,” and
composer Jonathan Kupper’s “The Mon-
key’s Paw” was ﬁrst a novella of the same
name by W.W. Jacobs. A g

Both Brochocka’s and Kupper’s pieces
have a long history. As is the norm with
such productions, the shows went through
cycles of workshops and revisions, employ-
ing a myriad of collaborators — Kupper
worked with Rachel Sheinkin, Tony Award
winning librettist of “The 25th Annual Put-
nam County Spelling Bee,” on a 2000 draft
of his play.

The operas began to gain acclaim this

Simkin: Be
bold with 

  curry

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

 

A “It needs how many ingredients and wants 'l

me to cook it for how long? Ha, that will never
happen.”

Such was my initial reaction to the daunt-
ing recipes I discovered for traditional Indian
curry — a dish I desperately craved during my
period of reverse culture shock after retuming
home from studying abroad in London.

But just when it seemed like I was going to
have to settle for a cup of tea and resign myself
forever to standard American fare, Iwas struck
by a revelation: I didn’t have to abide by the
recipe’s every rule. Choosing to do so meant ,
kissing authenticity goodbye but rebounding v
with convenience, deliciousness and perhaps
even a smug sense of achievement.

I adopted my curry recipe from AllRecipes.
com — speciﬁcally, the dish entitled “Indian
Chicken Curry II.” The beauty of a complex
dish like this islthat you can adjust it to what’s
available and to your dietary preferences. Nix

. the paprika if it doesn’t appeal to you, substi-

tute tofu forchicken, make a double batch
and refrigerate it for consumption later in the
week — whatever works. ‘

There’s not much room to play around in 
the ﬁrst step: Heat three tablespoons of olive by
oil and sauté one small chopped onion until
it caramelizes. But here’s where the ﬁin part
comes in: Add two cloves minced garlic, one
teaspoon ground cinnamon, one teaspoon
paprika, a half teaspoon of fresh grated gin-
ger root, at half teaspoon of white sugar and *’
a dash of salt. '

All those measurements of spices are cali-
brated to play off each other, so keep in mind
that adding or subtracting one might provoke
unusual and potentially undesirable results
from the others. Then again, such is the joy ,.
of experimentation.

Now onto the bay leaf. I can’t fathom the
purpose of throwing a leaf into any stewed
dish — or, more importantly, why it has to be
a bay leaf. I do, however, love the faintly fairy
tale-esque notion of putting in a leaf and then
ﬁshing it out. Maybe it satiates the oven elves‘ it
or keeps evil kitchen spirits at  bay. Aha,

“year when they qualiﬁed as ﬁnalists in
the renowned Opera Vista Competition
in Houston. Neither piece walked away
with the biggest award, but Brochocka
was awarded the inaugural Artistic Direc-

. tor’s Prize.

,. It was there, in Texas, that Cladera and

‘ Olden discovered‘ “Happy Garden of Life”
and “The Monkey’s Paw,” becoming cap-
tivated by the stories’ thematic elements.
They recognized the shows as being “right
up [their] alley” and operas that they them-
selves would want to see.

“Wow! Someone wrote a Kurt Vonnegut

opera. 1 want to do that,” Olden, a sci-ﬁ
fan, said he exclaimed after leaving the
theater.’
Once the process of obtaining rights
for the shows was completed, it was time
*va.lI0 ﬁnd a space. In the case of the Micro-
scopic Opera, though, “ﬁnd” meant “build.”
The company uses a method referred to as
“guerilla,” or on—site, theater, practiced by
other Pittsburgh companies to renovate
idiosyncratic environments. The space for
their shows became an abandoned portion
of the Eastside Shopping Center in East
Liberty.
For old friends and longtime associates
like Olden and Cladera, this opportunity
presented endless possibilities for fun and

adventure. Still, they never anticipated the

difﬁculties of what Olden called —- with
tongue ﬁrmly in cheek — a “glamorous”
job. .
‘.‘It’s much easier to go to a theater with
toilets, electricity and insurance,” said
Olden.

Up until the last minute, the ﬁnishing
touches on the space were still being com-
pleted. Preparations began in mid-August,
and the entire set~of the show was built in
one night of work by a hired carpenter. The
undertaking wasn’t easy, but the shows
— now in their second and ﬁnal week of
running — undeniably beneﬁted from the
unconventional stage.

Although they have plenty on their plate
already, The Microscopic Opera’s artistic
directors have big plans for the future.

These include the Pittsburgh premiere of

well—known composerjake Heggie’s “Three
Decembers” and a possible second run out—
side of the city. V

Olden and Cladera abide by a simple
philosophy: No matter how large or small a
show’s production value is, people will come
out if the artists involved infuse their work
with passion. Storytelling and entertain-
ment are the hallmarks of The Microscopic

. Opera Company, and to the directors, these

Improvise with recipe

Curry 4 7

mystery solved! One midsized bay leaf it is.
What’s still missing from our curry? Hmm,
what about actual curry powder? The recipe
I worked from originally advised three table-
spoons, and although I’ve seen comments

from online foodies advising ﬁve or even six ’

tablespoons, I used just one and foundxit more
than plenty. I’ve even experimented with a

‘powderless curry recipe for my non—culinary— A
adventure—inclined (read: lame) mother. So I _

leave that measurement entirely up to your

discretion. p V
Stir all your ingredients for two minutes

before adding bite—sized pieces of two Chicken

_ breasts. At this juncture my original recipe calls

for one tablespoon of tomato paste, one cup
of plain yogurt and three-fourths of a cup of

. , coconut milk, but I’ve found that this creates ‘

a bit too much sauce, even for serving over

a heaping bed of rice. Instead, I usually cut A

-down a bit on the watery ingredients — say
four-ﬁfths a cup of yogurt and ﬁve-eighths a
cup of coconut milk.

This is the part where you grab a magazine
— or better yet, the reading for tomorrow’s
class — and chill out in the kitchen for a bit
— about 20 to 25 minutes, occasionally stir-
ring. I caimot in good conscious advise you to
walk away from a pan on an operating stove, so
I’m going to ask that you not so much watch it
boil as casually glance at itfrom time to time

—— sneakily, so it doesn’t know you’re_looking
—— then turn down the heat to simmer.

Now the recipe calls for half the juice of a A
‘lemon and half a teaspoon of cayenne pep-

per. _

I will openly confess to having never added
the cayenne pepper. It’s not a seasoning I can
love, and I’ve made peace with that.

To be perfectly honest, I’m not sure how
much the lemon juice adds either.

This is the part where you ﬁsh out the way— C

Ward bay leaf — it’s'accomplished its task,
whatever that was — and allow the ingredi-
ents to bask in the leaf-free environment for
ﬁve minutes. . -

I like to use the traditional basmati or jas-
mine, but plain old white rice will do just ﬁne. If
you’re a pro at timing, you’ll start the rice while
the curryﬁnishes simmering. ifyou’re like me,
you’ll forget and start it afterwards.

For you health "nuts out there, the AllReci—
pes.com version claims to serve four people at
313 calories per serving.

Since most of the tinkering I’ve done in-
volves the subtraction of spices, I’m inclined
to guess this recipe will come in at a similar
caloric count, not including the rice. _

Whether you decide to heed my advice or
the website’s, the resulting concoction will
be delicious and indisputably result in a meal
considerably better than Easy Mac. ,

MEN’S SOCCER

Greg Trietley
Senior Stajf Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team brought solid de-
fense, perfect goalkeeping and an offensive out-
burst to the Pitt/Nike Toumamentthis weekend.
Because of that, it took home the title.

_ V A stellar performance from goalkeeper Hami
Kara and the Pitt defense led the Panthers past
Anny, 1-0, Friday night, and Pitt’s offense ex-
ploded Sunday against St. Joseph’s on the way
to aresounding 5-0 victory and the tournament‘
title. ‘

“We’re playingbetter every game,” Pitt coach

Joe Luxbachersaid Sunday. “We’re still not where
we can be, but it’s deﬁnitely a solid win and at
good weekend.”

Kara now has three shutouts in four games
as a Panther. Pitt’s veteran defense — three of
ﬁve starters are seniors — yielded just two shots
on goal against Army. .

“Defensively, we’ve been strong all year,”

‘ Luxbacher said.

Still, Pitt needed a goal to break the dead-
lock with the Black Knights. Junior midﬁelder
Ryan Brode provided just that in the 76th minute

‘ when he buried a shot past goalkeeper Ryan

Currens. -
Pitt would have left Founders Field with more

than one goal if notfor Currens’ six saves onthe V

night. The Panthers racked up 17 corner kicks
Friday, breaking the previous school record of
12 against Cincinnati in 2002. A

The Panthers found the back of the net plenty
of times on Sunday, however.

Junior Sam Luffy and senior Alex Betancourt
each scored twice, and the Panthers drubbed St.
Joseph’s, 5-0, in the program’s most resounding
victory in a decade.

“We ﬁnally broke out offensively,” Luxbacher
said. “We’ve been playing pretty good soccer and
creating a lot of chances but not always ﬁnding
a way to stick them in. Today, we di .”

Pitt hadn’t scored ﬁve goals in a game since
a5—1 victory over Bucknell inzooo, but the Pan-
thers scored early and often Sunday at North
Allegheny High School.

Betancourt, who hit the crossbar on a shot
on Friday, found his own rebound and put it past
Hawks’ goalkeeper Michael Moulton in the 16th
minute to give Pitt the lead. Betancourt scored
again in the 34th minute when he controlled
a throw-in and shot it past Moulton from 20
yards out. *

Junior Adam Monteverde j oined in the scor-
ing spree when he converted a cross from Terry
Boland in the 42nd minute to push the score

A ' to 3-0.

Luffy then capped the night for the Panthers

TONY’S TOP 10

Non—BCS conference schools can’t win

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Poor Boise State. Poor Utah and poor TCU.
Can they ever catch a break? ‘ T
No. 3 Boise State ﬁnally defeats a Top-
10 team in the regular season, and said.
“Top-10” team goes and loses to an FCS
team the next week. No. 4 TCU tries to
schedule tough opponents, but its biggest
non-conference game this year was its win
against No. 24 Oregon State. Meanwhile,
No. 14 Utah actually does have a challeng-
ing schedule, but apparently the voters
don’t care. . V
The experts were saying that this could
be the year that a non-BCS school — or
a team outside of the V“big six” confer-
ences —— could be selected to play in the
BCS National Championship Game. But

'it’S 0Iily'tlle‘S‘eCO'n'Cl"Vl_7et2l{,0f’t‘hE Séa’SOn,’ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘,‘-‘ ’ " ’ ' ’ ‘S’ ' ’ '.’

and it looks like these BCS-busters are P I
out of'luck, even though they all remain .

undefeated. .
This week, I give you 10 reasons why

BCS-busters will never make the National

Championship Game. '

I . Allowing a BCS-buster
'  0 in the title game would
7 1 O reaffirm that the BCS is

flawed to begin with. The BCS_sucks.
Everybody knows that. Even the BCS it-
self knows it sucks. Butlit makes money,

_ so its participants‘don’t care. If it allows

a school like Boise State into the title

' game, the BCS would be admitting that

its formula 7-‘ only giving automatic bids
to certain conferences —- is ﬂawed. The
BCS would never do that, no matter how
gooda Mountain West or Western Athletic
Conference team is.

minutes — both off passes from Terry Akpua V

— to give Pitt the decisive victory.

°" The Panthers out—shot St. Joseph’s, 21-5, for
the game.

The strong offensive on Sunday propelled the
Panthers to the Pitt/ Nike Tournament title, with
Betancourt, Brode, Kalas and Kara each earning
all-toumament team honors. Both the Panthers
and Duquesne went 2-0 on the weekend, but
Pitt out—scored the Dukes, 6-4. Duquesne beat
Army, 3-1, and Stjoseph’ , 1-0.

Pitt improved to 4-0 on the season with the
perfect weekend, and has already doubled their
win total from all of last season, but a tough
road lies ahead.

Friday at 5 p.m. in Morgantown, W. Va., as part
of the Big East Partner Weekend. .

After shutting down Army and St. Joseph’s,
Kara and the stingy Pitt defense will have to
worry about containingthe Dukes’ C]. Sapong,
who has six goals this year. °

“We have to prepare and step up against
James Madison,” Luxbacher said. “They have

one of the top goal scorers in the country, so
that’ll be a big test for us. Our guys are looking
forward to it.” I

schedule, the polls conveniently
ignore it. Boise State and TCU
started the seasoniin the Top 10, which
is important if a team wants to make it to
the National Championship. But the BCS-
buster with the toughest schedule — Utah
— started out at N o. 24. The Utes already
beat then-No. 15 Pitt. Later in the season,
they’ll host TCU and go to Notre Dame.
That schedule isn’t much easier than a
typical Big East or ACC schedule. There is
no reason that an undefeated Utah team
shou1dn’t make the title game, but it might

The ranked teams that they‘

0 that Virginia Tech was so mad at
Boise State for beating it in the frrst game
that it threw away its entire season to get
back at the Broncos. The victory over the
Hokies was supposed to be the signature
win that Boise State needed to ride into the
Championship. But Virginia Tech ended
up losing to FCS schooljames Madison on
Saturday —- making Boise State’s schedule

  

appear even weaker.

The Senate doesn’t care. During
the 2008-09 season, Utah Sena-
O tor Orrin Hatch urged the govern-
ment to investigate the BCS for violating
antitrust laws by excluding schools.like
undefeated Utah from the BCS National
Championship Game, but allowing one-
loss Oklahoma and one-loss Florida to
play. '
However, I’m pretty sure the Senate
has more pressing issues to consider —
after all, they have steroids in baseball to
worry about.

Nobody has the balls to sched-

4 ule them. Opponents of these

0 BCS—buster schools frequently

point to their weak schedules. The bust-

ers often try to schedule tougher non-

conference opponents, but nobody will
agree to play them. ,

. Pitt was the only BCS school to agree
to a homezand-home with Utah. And hon-
estly, it’s not in the best interest of top-tier
teams to schedule BCS-busters. Their con-
ference slates are tough enough, so why
schedule a potential loss when they could
just beat up on Coastal Carolina? That’d be

A a lot of risk for a small reward.

Utah ‘went and ruined every-
- thing by joining the Pac-10.
0 When Boise State announced that

it would be leaving the WAC to join the A

Mountain West Conference this summer,
it looked like the Mountain West could
ﬁnally earn that automatic BCS bid and

invitation. With Boise State,'Utah and
TCU in the same conference, the Moun-
tain West could have competed with the
Big East and the ACC, since both of those
leagues typically only have two or three

, ranked teams per year.

But then Utah accepted an invitation

to the Pac-10, crushing any chances of .

the Mountain West ever getting an au-
tomatic bid. And now Hatch’s argument
doesn’t matter, because Utah will be in
National Championship contention when
it becomes a Pac-10 member.

sec fans would be ticked. The

, 2 BCS gets a ton of money from the
0 SEC. When the size is in a BCS —

bowl, the fans fill the stadium — most
likely because they don’t have very far to
travel — and the television ratings are
through the roof. The SEC has won all
four BCS National Championship games
it’s been in recently, and its fans often
tout that it is the toughest league in the
country. A
If Boise State or TCU made the title
game over a one-loss Alabama, SEC fans
would be raging. And the BCS doesn’t want
to anger its biggest moneymakers.

0 if it adopted a — gasp! — playoff
system, what would college football fans

about the BCS instead. I
