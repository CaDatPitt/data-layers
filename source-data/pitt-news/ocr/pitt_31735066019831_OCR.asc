No charges
filed in
truck
accident

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

The Liquid Carbonic company
is conducting an investigation of
Monday's truck accident on
Lothrop Street in which a truck
carrying 4,200 gallons of liquid
oxygen tipped over while deliver-
ing to Presbyterian-University
Hospital. The Public Safety
department, however, is not
pressing any type of criminal
charges toward the driver or
company.

According to Margaret Rizzo,
public information coordinator
for the Public Safety department,
the truck, owned by the Liquid
Carbonic company, tipped over
at about 2:30 p.m. while backing
into the Presbyterian-Hospital
loading dock, between the hospi-
tal and Lothrop Hall.

Rizzo said that there was no
damage to the truck, and there
were no injuries. Pitt buildings
Lothrop Hall and Victoria Hall
were evacuated. _

Pittsburgh police and fire
departments were at the scene for
about four hours while the truck
was offloaded and then upright-
ed by a private contractor.

’’It was a relatively simple oper-
ation,” said Bob Farrow, supervi-
sor for the Public Safety
department. ”We did a lot of
precautionary things.

”He [the driver] has been in
and out of there [the hospital]
several times,” said Farrow.
”He’s said he's done 1,000 deliv-
eries, and he's never had a
problem.”

Farrow said that there may
have been a car parked by the
loading dock, perhaps causing
the driver ”to swing out a little
and tip over.”

’’It wasn't intentional. It was an
error possibly due to the driver,”
he said. ”The Public Safety

charges.”

The driver, affiliated with the
ball distribution department of Li-
quid Carbonic, was unavailable
for comment.

Farrow added that the steep-
ness of the grade on Lothrop
Street and the congestion in Oak-
land create difficulties for large
trucks making deliveries.

”You don’t normally expect
something like this to happen,”
said Frank Racckiewicz, public
relations spokesman for
Presbyterian-University Hospital.
’’I’m sure the driver is educated
on the contents of his truck.”

”We’re conducting an investi-
gation,” said a Liquid Carbonic
spokesman who wished not to be
identified. According to the

on May 19.

”When Jim got off the elevator,
he heard something drop and
heard a door close,” Farinella
said. ”Then, when he turned the
corner, he saw the phone, an-
swering machine and all its com-
ponents in a box.” Acierno
reported seeing no one near the
office.

Farinella said that since there
were no visible signs of a break-
in, the alleged burglar must have
had a key.

According to Farinella, Acierno
said that he locked the door after
checking his mail at approximate-
ly 5:30 p.m. that night. He disco-
vered the box when he returned

about 25 minutes later.

’’In a matter of 25 minutes,
someone was able to getinside

the office, disconnect everything
and get back out again,” Farinel-
la said.

Farinella also said that he found
a note on the desk in the IFC
office stating that the phone had

"been taken ”out for service.”

”But when I reconnected it, I real-
ized that it wasn't broken,” he
said.

Farinella said Officer Greer of
the Campus Police told him that
the |FCshould either change the

lock or fasten the telephone to
the cabinet on which it sits.

Farinella added that ”every-
thing was in order" when he left
the office and locked both the
outside and insidedoors earlier
that day.

’’I have no idea who tried to
take it,” he said. ’’I just know that
to get it, they had to have a key.”

Only a few members of the IFC
have keys to the office, according
to Farinella.

Pennsylvania to start new underage drinking law

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Minors
who consider using alcohol
should think twice in light of a
new law that imposes steep
penalties on underage drinkers, a
state lawmaker said.

The drinking law, which took
effect yesterday, imposes manda-
tory fines and suspends the
licenses of minors caught buying
or drinking alcohol in Penn-
sylvania.

The law mandates that any un-
derage drinking violation would
result in a 90-day suspension of
a minor’s driver's license on a
first offense. The punishment
would stand even if the offender

were not drinking and driving.

Rep. Kevin Blaum, D—Luzerne,
said the law will spread the word
quickly that ”Pennsylvania’s not
going to wink at underage drink-
ing any more.”

”Certainly, when the first kid
loses their license, the word's go-
ing to get around fast about this
law," Blaum said Monday.

Under the law, underage drink-
ing violations occur when an in-
dividual under 21 possesses, uses
or transports alcohol, possesses a
fake identification card or falsifies
the age on an ID card.

Second offenders would lose
their driver's licenses for a year,

and third offenders would receive

Fines of up to $500 could be

Adults who buy alcohol for

Paris added that Lothrop Hall
and Victoria Hall were evacuat-
ed for general safety precautions,
and that the hospital ”had four
more days of oxygen left” prior
to the accident.

”He made the turn too sharply,
and it turned on its side,” said
Ann McKenna, a Pitt senior who
works in Victoria Hall and wit-
nessed the accident. ”They

[police] called us on the tele-
phone in the nursing library and
told us to evacuate immediately.”

McKenna also said that police
and firemen arrived quickly on
the scene.

”When he was cutting the
wheels, it went on thecurb, and
it tilted,” said witness Carol Hod-
kiss, a secretary at Victoria Hall.
Hodkiss also said that she has
previously seen Liquid Carbonic

trucks make ”everyday deliver-
ies” to the hospital.

”it can occur anywhere,” said
Vicki Nesta, an employee at
Lothrop Hall. ”it was just an ac-
cident.”

said that patient care at

in your sexual activities because

this kind of whimsy with my hus-

inconsiderate.

A: If you mean that at different

. times you have different feelings

about intimacy with your hus-
band, I think you have to let him
know that wanting sex is some-
thing like wanting to eat certain.
things like steak and onions or
strawberry shortcake, or like
wanting to watch a movie some-
times and at other times wanting
to do a crossword or clean out
the refrigerator. It is not because
your appraisal of him as a man
and a lover is undergoing danger-
ous changes.

  /\/Ian expects girlfriend to take the precautions

We are spending a lot of time
nowadays trying to persuade men
that women need wooing and
loving before sex —— at least, a
majority of women are like that.
(Women who feel otherwise,
who may be ready for sex much
of the time and not often need-
ing long preparation, do exist,
and that is their way; there is

A nothing wrong with them, or, to
use a popular but often unhelp-

ful word, ”abnormal.”) And sincea

so much is said to the effect that
men have to consider women's
need for wooing, sometimes a
mistaken idea is put across. It is
understandable that a man can
get the idea that if his woman

. doesn’t want sex, it means that he
is approaching her in a wrong
way.

Whereas the fact is that some-
times she just doesn't want sex
when he does, no matter how
considerate or imaginative or
skillful he may be. If she accepts

this about herself, she probably’

can let him know in a nice way,
and then he should be able to un-
derstand it, too.

And there should be an under-
standing that sometimes one or
the other may not want intimacy
of any kind and may, instead,
want to withdraw fora while to
another room, or into a nap, or
just silence.

What does George

I‘ Bush really want?

President Reagan and Vice President George Bush have fi-
nally had their first quarrel since Bush's nomination became
inevitable. For many months, Vice President Bush has been ac-
cused of being little more than a yes—man for the president, a
vessel through which Mr. Reagan's opinions might flow.

All that seems to be changing. As a result of State Depart-
ment negotiator Michael Kozak’s talks with Panamanian lead-
er Manuel Noriega, there is the outline of an agreement under
which Noriega would leave Panama for a period of nine months
as well as resign his position as head of the Panamanian Defense
Forces. In return for his departure, the administration has said
it is willing to drop the drug—smuggling indictment filed against
Noriega in Miami.

Ah, but this is the age-of saying no, and there is probably
no bigger issue blocking the campaign trail than drugs. Michael
Dukakis is threatening to ride his anti-drug policy all the way
to the White House, a fact readily apparent to any Republican.

Mr. Bush has decided that the Noriega issue is a good one
on which to begin his weaning from the Reagan household.
According to the vice president, it is totally inappropriate to
negotiate with drug-smugglers, and the indictments should be
left until Noriega can be brought to trial, a possibility even Bush
recognizes as remote.

Because the situation in Panama is receiving so much atten-
tion in the media, Bush's decision to break with Reagan poli-
cy seems remarkably well—timed politically. If Mr. Bush were
not running for president, his motivations for taking a hard
stance might not seem important, but, in this instance, it is not
enough to simply examine his proposals.

If his decision to oppose the negotiations was made with one
eye on the polls, such a choice speaks poorly of the candidate's
commitment to the idea of self-determination in government.
If, on the other hand, he is sincerely unsettled by setting a prece-
dent of bargaining with suspected drug—smugglers, then his op-
position would be more defensible, although still unreasonable.

Under the current plan, which has not been approved, Norie-
ga would have a hand in setting up elections for May '89,
although he would be unable to participate in those elections.
Conceivably, because the Panamanian Defense Forces would
be left intact, Noriega could be back in power within a couple
of years. It is interesting to note, in closing, that former Panama-
nian President Eric Arturo Delvalle has not been included so
far in the negotiations, even though he is still recognized offi-
cially as the Iegitimate leader of Panama (witness the econom-
ic sanctions imposed to bring him back to power).

And, in addition, Nancy Reagan has decided to agree with
Mr. Bush, in light of her ”Just Say No” campaign. One wonders
how long the president can hold out.

Perhaps it would be interesting to see what would happen
if the administration included leaders of the Panamanian op-
position to Noriega in its consideration of the November elec-
tions (or was that the future of Panama). It is sometimes hard
to tell.

In a nutshell 

Unless the country stands ready to transform itself into a totalitarian state,
even the theory of nuclear war is absurd.

On jousting with scarecrows

Matthew Thornton's [column]
last Wednesday (the 18th) treats
Christianity as part of a hypocrit-
ical establishment. I have a great
deal of sympathy for this point of
view, since I was an atheist until
very recently. Nonetheless, I
think it isa mistake.

Mr. Thornton reviews several
commandments, starting with
”Thou shalt not kill:  The Cru-
sades were sanctioned by God,
no?” Please remember that the
First Crusade was called because
the Seljuk Turks had invaded
Palestine and closed off Jerusa-
lem to pilgrims.

The Crusaders were not in and
of themselves wrong. The trage-
dy is that they were subverted by
men with no further end in view
than looting the Middle East, or
(in the Fourth Crusade) the
Byzantine Empire. Most Christi-
ans treat murder and war differ-
ently because they are different
-— the intent is different, and so,
usually, are the means. Almost all
philosophies would agree that
killing is allowed in self-defense
or defense of another, although
there is a long and honorable tra-
dition of Christian pacifism.

On stealing, Mr. Thornton says
that ”taking land  inhabited for
thousands of years by a heathen
people is not stealing.” If this
is meant to represent the Christi-
an viewpoint, it is mistaken. It is
true that a 16th-century Pope ced-
ed the Americas to Spain and Por-
tugal without regard for the
feelings of Native Americans.
But, I think that almost all Chris-
tians nowadays would agree that
this was simply wrong. Some
Christians said so at the time —-
Mr. Thornton might be interest-
ed in the work of the Dominican
Friar Las Casas in what is now
Guatemala, or that of Father
Jogues among the Hurons.

I could answer similar parodies
of other commandments, but I
think my point is clear. Mr.
Thornton is attacking a straw
man. The Christianity he is talk-
ing about exists only in the minds
of anti-Christians. For the original
article,_ please‘ read the New
Testament.

Racing to disaster

We, the undersigned, wish to
express our concern over recent
traffic conditions’ on Forbes
Avenue between Squirrel Hill
and Oakland. Due to activities at
Carnegie Mellon University,
traffic —— during rush hour — was
backed up the entire length of
Forbes avenue to Forbes and
Murray avenues.

The cause of this traffic tie—up
was a ”race” sponsored by the
university for their Spring Car-
nival. It is a sad indictment on our
city that children are left standing
on the street corner because their
school buses cannot get to them,
that people are late for work or
school, or cannot get to a medi-
cal facility in Oakland because a
group of university students feel
a need to act out their adolescent,
competitive natures during the
heaviest traffic flow period in the
city.

It is also a sad indictment on
the current administration of this
city that this activity is allowed to
occur on one of the heaviest-
traveled roads of the city. Every
year, Pittsburghers are expected
to take this traffic tie-up in stride,
but this year, the snarl of traffic
was worse because of several
different reasons: (I) alternate
routes were blocked by road con-
struction to a large degree and (2)
this activity was not widely pub-
licized to Pittsburghers so that
they might make arrangements to
leave early or to try to find
another route to their destination.

If the city feels a need to par-
ticipate in this act of obvious

favoritism toward the students of
Carnegie Mellon, then at least it
would have been wise, beneficial
and compensatory to the rest of
us to warn us of the impending
disaster.

Surely, a "race” through the
city streets should not take prece-
dence over children getting to
school at the proper time or peo-
ple having access to hospitals and
medical facilities. Perhaps it is
time that the city looked at the
priority it is giving to Carnegie
MeIlon’s Spring Carnival. If it is
a ”must” that the rest of us suffer
aggravation and inconvenience
so that the students of Carnegie
Mellon have a wonderful time, at
least advise CMU students that
they must have a wonderful time
during non—rush-hour traffic.

Editor's note: The preceding

letter was signed by 25 Pittsburgh

residents.
In poor taste

I have been reading The Pitt
News for almost four years. Ever
since I have come to this univer-
sity in I983, I have seen all kinds
of ads and articles in bad taste.
Your most recent issue [May 18]
with the sexual-intended ads in
the classified section are in ex-

_tremely bad taste. You are giving

this university a bad name.

What is your intention? Do you
want to promote sex on the cam-
pus? I feel that you should choose
your ads more carefully in the
future. .

There are several people on the
campus who find these ads in
bad taste, and I think it is time to
deny such ads.

Blossoms on the trees, sun-
bathers on the Cathedral lawn
and for Pittsburgh theater—goers,
entertainers performing around
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre
clearly indicate summer and that
it is time once again for the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival. On
May 27, that long-awaited scene
will appear as the festival opens
its ninth season.

This year's plays should be a
real treat. The first play is
Shakespeare's Taming of the
Shrew, featuring Mary Robb Jack-
son as the shrewish Kate and Alex
Coleman as Petruchio. Coleman
will also direct the play, which
runs May 27—June 19.

Following Taming of the Shrew
will be Ben Jonson's Volpone
(The Fox) with Jay Brazeau, who
had the title role in Cyrano in
1987, playing the lead. Volpone
runs June 24-July 17.

Finishing the festival is
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar,
directed by Coleman. It runs July
22-August 14.

producing director of the festival
and chairman of the theater arts

department, explained how the
plays are chosen. ”|t’s a pretty
simple formula -— something
light, something heavy and some-
thing in between. Within these
guidelines, we take many things
into consideration,” he said.
Some factors considered are what
brings actors back, what plays are
directors compelled to do and
what the public wants to see.
”We’ve done a slightly better
job of fitting the three plays
together this year,” he said.
Favorini explained that it's
difficult to find plays in which ac-
tors from one show can carry
through to the other plays. Favori-
ni also said that when he thought
of Volpone, he knew Brazeau
would be perfect for the part. Last
year, he was popular as Cyrano.
Enticing peopleto the theater

and helping them to enjoy it is
just one of Favorini’s goals. He
explains that the entertainers on
the lawn are just one of the
devices used to make the more
timid theater-goer, or those suffer-
ing from what he calls ”bard-o-
phobia,” more comfortable. He
said coming to a play is an enter-
tainment experience to enliven
the imagination and lift the
spirits.

In an effort to prevent young
people from developing bard—o-
phobia, there is an outreach pro-
gram for area high schools. Those
participating receive a study
guide with information about
Shakespeare's plays, his period
(the Elizabethan) and the festival's
interpretation of the play to be
viewed.

A company member then visits

the school prior to the students’
seeing the play. Students, who
now have a lot more background
information, view the play in spe-
cial matinee performances. These
performances are May 19-20 and

‘ 

Our festival is un-
pretentious and down
to earth like the people
of our community.

— Attilio Favorini

24-27. This year, 70 schools will
take advantage of the program.

”lt is in our enlightened self-
interest to do this,” stated Favori-
ni, claiming that they'd be play-

ing to empty seats unless they
invest in future theater-goers. He
is even talking about a future
”Shakespeare for Tots” program.

The founder of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival, Favorini
said that the festival ”partakes of
the spirit of the community,” and
that it has ”emerged from the ar-
tistic life of the community.”

Favorini, who has decided to
remain at Pitt with the universi-
ty's renewed support of his pro-
gram, is like the festival he
describes. ”Our festival is un-
pretentious and down to earth
like the people of our communi-
ty. It’s not weighted down with
classical tradition.”

Various Artists
Dry Lungs III
(Placebo Records)

A placebo is usually defined as a pill without
medicine, bland and without substance.
However, Arizona's Placebo Records in its
eight—year existence has tried its hardest to
reverse the meaning of the term.

With its releases of Phoenix groups includ-
ing JFA, Mighty Sphincter, Maybe Mental and
Sun City Girls, Placebo has skirted the preci-
pice of thrashing noise. Finally, .with the Dry
Lungs record compiled by Paul Lemos of Con-
trolled Bleeding fame, the champions of indus-
trial music were gathered from ten countries
onto one hell of a dissonant disc.

The newly released Dry Lungs,Volume III
continues the dual process of ”mellowing out”
and diversification begun by the second
volume in the compilation series. From pure
sheets of noise molded by earlier industrial
musicians, the varying subgenres of ritual, at-
mospheric, performance art and even some

new age intermingle within the grooves of Dry
Lungs Ill, though only five countries make it
on this time.

For those hooked on the idea that industrial
must be rhythm-based, two French outfits offer
some reassurance. Die Form flays a simple
Muslimgauze—like pound over layers of dark-
ness in “Animal Instinct,” while Collectif Nox
pounces on a cutthroat tribally-screamed
”Chantzado” embellished by the trumpet-
through—a-delay work reminiscent of local ar-
tists P. Children.

On the softer side, pieces by New York’s Ar-
thur Potter, Phoenix favorite Maybe Mental,
West German tape-ritualists Cranioclast and
master media manipulator John Wiggins all
offer brief respites. Tranquility is often abruptly
unsettled by the introduction of crashing
shards. It's best to allow the mind to drift away
into the alternate realities of these works, unin-
hibited by previous musical conventions.

Of course, there's always the noise, exem-
plified by Lemos’ own contribution (a slight
return to Controlled Bleeding’s earlier style)

Placebo easy to swallow in Dry Lungs

and ”French Pan Pan" by Helen Sage, which
really sounds like pots and pans. The quality
production of Dry Lungs III also includes a
peak in the history of artsy-improv from per-
formance artists Un Drane Musical lnstantane,
which resembles an entire orchestra in self-
destruct mode.

The plusses of Dry Lungs far outweigh the
minus - Greater Than One’s weak new age
rendition of pseudo-Oriental melodies (haven't
we heard this 10,000 times on every Yuppie-
wallpaper record?). The scrambled jazz-rock
by Phantom Toolbooth, coincidentally titled
”New Age Hell,” is commendable, but would
have been more appropriate on the SST No
Age compilation; it's way out of place here.

All told, Dry Lungs III is an impressive and
comprehensive collection of modern ex-
perimental music. As long as they avoid the

J pitfalls of placidity, here's hoping Paul Lemos

and Placebo release many more volumes of
this essential series. The world needs a sprin-
kle of iron shavings in its oatmeal every once

Looking for contentment in the lap of Luxuria

_ Luxuria

Unanswerable Lust
Beggar's Banquet

Whether you're into stroking
rich Corinthian leather or feeling
the wealth of velour against your
skin, one thing is for sure: neither
sensation can compare to listen-
ing to Luxuria’s first album, Un-
answerable Lust.

: Although the band's name
sounds like some cheesy imita-
tion base metal (Luxuria actually
translates from Latin as ”lust”),
their music is the genuine article.
Howard Devoto of the Buzz-
cocks and founding member of
Magazine has returned from a
lengthy hiatus with a. new col-
laborator, Noko, to produce ad-
venturous music that expands
upon the accepted norm, even
for underground music. The mu-
sic on Unanswerable Lust is jar-
ringly melodic. Guitarist Noko,

" although not quite a wunderkind,

performs some interesting solos

that are surprisingly unexpected.
”Rubbish” and ”Redneck," two
of the album's best tracks, show-
case Noko’s talent with great
effect.

Both ”Redneck” and ”Rub—
bish” are constructed around
strong melodies and filled with ir-
resistible hooks, and yet some-
how, they manage to avoid
falling into the cliche of main-
stream radio schlock. What saves
these songs from such certain
death is their production and,
more importantly, their lyrics.

Howard Devoto was never one
to babble incessantly about noth-
ing — even if it seemed he was,
he wasn't. He always tries to set
up a mood or a story in an artic-

ulate manner. ”Rubbish” has a '

startlingly bizarre refrain, ’’I leave
to you the rubbish of my love."
In the context of the concept of
which the rest of the songs are a
part, the ego interplay is hilarious
and biting.

”Redneck” falls into this sar-
castic category as well. ”Red-

lyrics. He convincingly portrays
the satyr in ”Public Highway”:
I am the public highway, no

neck” is written about a friend of
Devoto’s who he said is ”so full
of intemperately hot air that you
never quite get to learn what it is place for pretense or protocol.
that he really wants you to know. For any other band or any other
He fancies himself an image ._
breaker but can't get away from
the reflections of himself in the
shattered fragments.” The charac-
ter in ”Redneck” states that he is
”a major prophet" and ”heaven
and hell-bent strong.”

For those not initiated to Devo-
to’s vocals — he is similar to a
cross between Television's Tom ,
Verlaine and Lou Reed —— they if K
are a little quirky but very effec-
tive when reading his obsessive

person, this debut album would
be considered a masten/vork, but
for Howard Devoto, it is just a
reaffirmation of his talent and
style.

THE PITT NEWS

Sports Editor

The vacant assistant coaching
position on the Pitt men's basket-
ball team was filled this week
with the addition of John Saran-
drea, head coach at Tolentine
High School in New York City.

Sarandrea, 30, will be in town
Thursday to sign a contract nam-
ing him successor to John
Calipari, who was hired as head
Coach by the University of Mas-
sachusetts last month.

”[Sarandrea] has experience as

5 runners
qualify for
'88 trials

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

Five members of the Pitt men's
track team have qualified for the
U.S. Olympic Trials, which will
take place in mid-July in Colora-
do Springs.

Junior Lee McRae will run the
100-meter, sophomore Dave
Moore and senior Tim Manes
will run the 800—meter, freshman
Elbert Ellis will compete in the
400-meter hurdles, and sopho-
more Eric Cannon will compete
in the 110-meter hurdles.

Will these five qualify for the
1988 Olympic Games? ”lt’s hard
to say,” said Pitt head coach John
Vasvary. ”A lot of countries just
name their team. The big key for

, us is what happens that day,” he

added.

All-American Lee McRae is no
stranger to the trials. This trip will
mark his second Olympic Trial
competition. For McRae, ability
is obviously not the issue — con-
sistency, however, could be
McRae’s ticket to the games.

”Lee has been very consistent
every year,” said Vasvary.

Eric Cannon could prove to be
a tough competitor for Pitt. ”He’s
won the races that he needed to
win,” said Vasvary. ”At the trials,
he'll be dealing with people like
[former Pitt track star] Roger King-
dom. Eric is running well and
may be considered a suprise, but
not a big suprise. He should be
considered.”

Both Dave Moore and Tim
Manes are competing in the
800—meter. Despite an injury,
Moore will hopefully take part in
the trials. ”Dave has an injury,
but we're hoping he can come off

a head coach, great recruiting ties
in New York City, and he's an ag-
gressive person,” said Pitt assis-
tant coach Mark Coleman.
”He’l| pretty much fill coach
Calipari’s position,” Coleman
said. ”He and I will be equal.”
Coleman said Sarandrea was
the Panther coaching staff's first
choice as Calipari’s replacement.
Pitt lost a renowned recruiter
when Calipari left for UMass, but
Sarandrea is expected to fill that
void. The Panthers have never
had much luck recruiting in the
basketball hotbed of New York

City, and Sarandrea’s experience
in that city could be of great
benefit to the Panthers.

”...He has the ability to be-
come an outstanding recruiter,”
Pitt coach Paul Evans said in a
press release.

Sarandrea guided Tolentine to
a 101-19 record as head coach
over the past four years and was
also an assistant coach for four
years prior to that.

Tolentine won the New York
Class A title and was largely con-
sidered one of the best teams in
the nation.

Wednesday, May 25, 1988

”John’s great. His record at
Tolentine speaks for itself,” Evans
said.

”|’ve had aspirations to coach
on a college level for some time,”
Sarandrea said in a press release.
”My coaching philosophy is very
similar to that of coach Evans,
and coaching at Pitt and being in-
volved in the Big East should be
a tremendous learning ex-
perience and growth oppor-
tunity.”

Sarandrea was scheduled to
hold a press conference at 3:30
yesterday afternoon to announce

Charles Smith performed well enough in last week's Olympic basketball trials in Colorado
Springs, CO. to make coach John Thompson's second series of cuts. Smith, who was
named Big East Player-of-the-Year last season, is one of three league members remain-
ing in the trials. For more on the updated squad, see story on page 10.

his new position.

and UMass.

Township.

Track team
places 6th
at I C4A '5

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Led by Eric Cannon’s victory in
the 110-meter hurdles, the Pitt
men's track team finished sixth in
the lC4A Championships held at
Yale University last weekend.

Cannon was timed in 13.94
while Elbert Ellis was clocked in
14.20, fast enough to ensure the
precocious freshman a third-
place finish.

Another strong performance
was turned in by Ellis in the
400-meter hurdles. He finished
third with a fine 50.46 clocking.

The 1,600-meter relay team of
Neil Malbickey, Ellis, Chop Bur-
ton and Rowan Mighty finished
third in a time of 3:08.67, thus
completing a trifecta of third
place finishes for Ellis.

Mighty further contributed to
the Panther cause in nailing
down a sixth-place finish in the
400-meter run (47.39).

A particularly gratifying perfor-
mance for the Pitt coaching staff
was turned in by Paul Friedrich
in the steeplechase. Friedrich was
timed in 8:59.81, finishing fifth in
the event.

Pitt coach John Vasvary ex-
plained his enthusiasm over
Friedrich’s run: ”Paul was injured
in the lC4A indoor meet and was
not able to really run until about
three weeks ago. He really ran
well in the meet.”

Particularly satisfying for Vas-
vary was the performance of
some of the younger Panthers in
the meet. ”We were really
pleased with the results. We went
to the meet with a young group,

Braves fail to locate true root of problem

The firing of Atlanta Braves’
manager Chuck Tanner came
suddenly Sunday night, although
it wasn't unexpected.

Tanner's team was supposedly
being reviewed that particular
weekend by team officials during
the Pirates—Braves series. Tanner's
job was on the line. If the play-
ers performed well, he would
stay on, but a bad weekend
would mean the end of the Tan-
nerregime in Atlanta.

The Braves came to Pittsburgh
with an 11-25 record, the worst

in the National League and sec-
ond worst in the majors, trailing
only the Baltimore Orioles. The
Pirates took the first two games of
the series 10-3 and 7-3. The sec-
ond game showed the Braves
blow a three-run lead.

In the third game on Sunday,
the Braves jumped out to a 6-0
second-inning lead, but this time,
they made it stick, winning 6-4.

Sunday's win apparently
wasn't good enough.

Tanner received the news of
his dismissal —- as did coaches

SAM
'I'AI.I.ARICO

Bob Skinner, Joe Lonnett, Willie
Stargell and trainer Tony Barti—
rome —— upon arrival in Chicago,
where the Braves were to play the
Cubs on Monday.

It seems, however, that the
Braves failed to fi re the man that
is responsible for the team and
the players on that team —- Atlan-

ta general manager Bobby Cox.
As general manager, Cox is
responsible for acquiring the best
athletes he can draft, trade and
wheel—and-deal. The Braves
finished fifth last year in the N.L.
West, not exactly an ideal place,
but it was an improvement from
the 1986 Braves, who finished
dead last. ’
Although the general mana-
ger's job is to bring in quality
players, he's allowed the likes of
slugger Bob Horner, pitchers
Gene Garber and David Palmer

and infielders Rafael Ramirez and
Glenn Hubbard to slip out of his
grasp in the last two years.

Since then, the team has had to
survive with what's left. Here are
a few of the key players.

0 The team still has its superstar
‘outfielder Dale Murphy, but with
the lack of quality players, Mur-
phy hasn't had the luxury of hav-
ing good hitters around him.
Opposing pitchers pitch around
him and his numbers have
suffered. After last season's 35

home runs and near .300 batting
average, Murphy has only five
homers with 12 runsbatted in
and a .220 average as of last
Fnday.

0 Dion James, center fielder.
He has 105 at bats this season,
but no home runs and only five
RBI to show for it. His .265 aver-
age is second best on the team,

also he's still in the lineup.

0 Gerald Perry, first baseman.
He stroked over 20 home runs
last year in his first full season,
largely thanks to Horner’s depar-
ture to play baseball in Japan.
This season, he’s hit only two
homers, but his 18 RBI is tied
with shortstop Andres Thomas’
for the team lead. Perry's .280
average also leads the team.

0 Ozzie Virgil, catcher. Virgil
also had over 20 home runs last
year, but this season, his numbers
have fallen off: four homers, 11

‘ RBI, .212 average.

°Ron Cant, rookie second
baseman. Cant replaced Hub-
bard but is still learning to hit
major league pitching (.207 aver-

age, two home runs, 13 RBI).

0 Zane Smith, pitcher. Smith
won 15 games last year but this
year is 2-3 with a 4.31 ERA.
Despite arm trouble this season,
the New York Yankees and
Toronto Blue Jays are interested
in his services.

Cox was the former manager of
the Blue Jays before becoming
the Braves’ general manager.

Granted, the fallen figures of
Perry, Virgil and Murphy are not
Cox's fault entirely, but he should
have taken some of the heat.

When a reporter asked Braves’
outfielder Ken Griffey if Tanner
was the reason why the team has
struggled, Griffey denied it, say-
ing he could only work with what
he had.

If what Griffey said has any
truth to it, and it obviously does,
Cox is mostly at fault, not Tanner.
Cox continues to talk about the
firing in the best interests of the
club, but whose interest is really
being watched out for?

The Braves decided to bring up
minor league coach Russ Nixon,

of it,” said Vasvary.

Both Moore and Manes are
ranked high in the 800—meter.
They also have ability; but that
ability may not be enough, as is
the case with Cannon. ’’It will be
a battle,’’ said Vasvary. ”They
will have to reach for a little ex-
tra,” he added.

Elbert Ellis is going into the tri-

ﬁs with one of the fastest times
in the country for the 400—meter
hurdles. ”EIbert has been very
consistent,” said Vasvary. ’’If he
can keep his consistency through
the rounds, he should have no
problem qualifying,” he added.

Along with these five qualifiers
are two more team members who
have a good chance to qualify for
the trials at NCAAs this weekend
in Eugene, Ore.

Seniors Calvin Holmes and
Bob Weiner will be competing in
the l10—meter hurdles and

F11-1500—meter, respectively. Both

are within 10ths of seconds of
qualifying. ”They both have a
good shot at NCAAs,” said
Vasvary.

Track

Continued from page 8
and they all performed well,”
said Vasvary.

Indicative of the results was EI-
Iis’ trifecta. On Saturday, he had
to qualify for the finals in both
hurdle events as well as partici-
pate in the 1,600-meter relay tri-
als. On Sunday, Ellis participated
in all three finals and showed all
the yeoman effort was well worth
It.

While the men were at the
|C4A Championships, the train-
ing continued for star freshman
Keisha Demas. She is attempting
to become Pitt's first female quali-
fier for nationals. To that end, she
is the sole female track perform-
er still running in competition.

Demas has fallen just short of
the NCAA Championship
qualifying standard in the
400—meter run of 53.25. Two
weeks ago at the Eastern Cham-
pionships, she ran a 53.50. This
week at Howard University, she
hopes to improve on that time by
at least a quarter of a second.

Swim team lands seven recruits

By Kirk Swauger
For The Pitt News

David Belowich has been the
women's swimming coach at the
University of Pittsburgh for the
past eight years, overseeing the
careers of All-Americans and
even an Olympian. But the in-
coming collection of aquatic ta-
lent he has assembled for this
year is unparalleled.

”On paper, it is perhaps the
best class we've ever had,” Be-
lowich said, after signing seven
quality swimmers. ”We’|l find
out in four years how they do, but
we filled a lot of voids, and it
looks like we're going to be a
very strong team next year.”

Belowich’s recruits for 1988
are:

0 Karin Masil from Rockville,
Md. Masil was a high school All-
American and has qualified for
the Olympic Trials in the 100 and
200—yard breaststroke. ”She
brings the potential to be the best
breaststroker ever to walk
through the door at Pitt,” Be-
lowich said.

0 Laura Lee Sullivan from

Rochester, N.Y. Sullivan was a
junior national finalist and has
qualified for the senior nationals.

0 Noelle Barry from Charlotte,
N.C, a junior national finalist in
the butterfly.

0 Christine Gallagher from
Parkside, Pa., a high school All-
American and state finalist in the
50 and l00—yard freestyle. She
finished second in the state in the

50 and third in the 100 and has
qualified for the senior nationals.

0 Susan Baker from Baldwin,
Pa., a butterflier.

0 Carolina Day from Millford,
Conn., a distance freestyler.

0 Janine Atiyeh from Emmaus,
Pa. Atiyeh qualified for the junior
nationals and was a state finalist
in the 100—yard backstroke.
