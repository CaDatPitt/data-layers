O'Connor gone Aug. 1, not April

Former law school Dean namecl interim chancellor

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor ‘

Former Law School Dean
Mark A. Nordenberg has been
nominated to serve as interim
chancellor beginning Aug. 1,
when]. Dennis O’Connor will
vacate the office, nine months
earlier than expected.

O’Connor originally

announced that he planned to step
down in April 1996. According to
a press release issued by Pitt,
O’Connor said he will now pur-

University of Pittsburgh

sue “some opportunities in higher
education that will be beneficial
to the University of Pittsburgh,
but which will require more time
than he could devote to them
while serving as Chancellor.”

O’Connor will receive
$313,792 upon his resignation.
That sum was based on a one-
month vacation beginning Aug.
1, followed by a four-month
administrative leave and a one-
yearlong sabbatical, according to
Director of Communications Ken
Service;

O’Connor could not be reached
for comment.

State Rep. Ronald Cowell, a
member of the board of trustees,
speculated that O’Connor may
have stepped down early because
of the difficulty of leading a large
university during a transition peri-
od. 6

“I respect the chancellor’s deci-
sion to leave earlier than he said
he would,” Cowell said. “During
a lengthy transition period,
whether you’re in government or
any other institution, if you’re a

lame duck, it’s difficult to be as

‘ effective a leader as you’re sup-

posed to be.”

O’Connor’s decision to resign
“was probably the right one for
Pitt,” said another member of the
board, State Sen. Michael Fisher.
O’Connor had “tremendous ideas
about higher education,” but
“some constituencies, some
members of the board of trustees,
lost conﬁdence.

“When you do that, you can't
get the job done.”

If the state legislature does not offer Pitt more
funding, students may be looking at a.4.5 percent
tuition increase for the fall semester.

Gov. Ridge’s proposed state budget offers little
funding increase for state—related and state—owned
schools, and leaves Pitt with a higher deficit than
expected- ‘

“It is certainly a disappointment to us,” said Joseph
Gil, interim associate vice chancellor for budget and
administration. “We hoped we could hold the
increase of tuition this year [to 3.5 percent].”

“We requested a 6 percent increase [in funding] in
October,” said Gil, “which we thought was an
extremely realistic one.”

He said that Gov. Ridge proposed a significantly J

lower number than was expected.

“In actuality, we received a one-and-a-half percent
increase,” he said. “So, it was substantially less.”

Ken Service, director of communications, said that
this increase would raise tuition for full-time, in-state
students by a total of $220, making the total cost of
one year at Pitt $5,184. He also said that if an
increase does take place, out-of-state tuition will also
be raised 4.5 percent, augmenting the cost from the
current $10,786 to $11,270 per year.

Gov. Ridge had a large state appropriation and left
the university with less money than expected,
Service said.

“We try to keep the tuition as low as possible,” he
said. .
Gil said that after the news of the slight increase
came, they went back to the drawing board to figure
out how they could compensatefor the university’s
fixed costs.

He said some of those ways were to put a freeze on
salaries and hiring, and also to propose a tuition
increase.

There were many factors involved in determining

KOBE, Japan — No looting

muscling their way into the
demolition and construction
businesses.

While no one is smashing

police and journalists say
criminal gangs known as
“yakuza” pocket at least 2 or
3 percent of all construction
spending in Japan.

JERUSALEM — Israeli

series of attacks.

The arrests were the latest
in an Israeli crackdown on
Hamas, whose armed wing,

Ito did not say which jurors

The question is whether
there is enough jurors to last

Chancellor

0From page 1

Although the chancellor has
collected praise for his high
vision of how to strengthen the
university, he failed to gain the
support of key trustees and facul-
ty for his style of implementing
this vision. Many say that
Nordenberg would infuse this
lacking element into the chancel-
lorship, as he has proven his abili-
ty to lead and to build consensus
among various groups.

“I’ve had a lot of opportunity to
see him in action as interim
provost and with the university
planning and budgeting commit-
tee,” said James Holland, a psy-
chology professor and president
of the University Senate. “He lis-
tens to all the issues, he’s very
forthright in saying things the
way they are, providing conclu-
sions and report[ing] it to others
without shading, without sanitiz-
ing.”

O’Connor’s style of leadership
did not work well with opposi-
tion, said Holland. His recent
decision to drop the insurance
carrier HealthAmerica despite
faculty wishes to keep it under-
scores this incompatibility.

“I don’t think Mark
[Nordenberg] would work that
way — I think there would have
been an effort to build a consen-
sus,” Holland said.

With O’Connor, “a lot of things
don’t get responded to, and Mark

responds to everything —
requests and input,” Holland said.
‘No matter what decision [the
chancellor] would ﬁnally make, it
should not have come as a sur-
prise.”

Members of the board of
trustees will vote on
Nordenberg’s nomination at the
June 22 board meeting.

Currently, Nordenberg is a pro-
fessor at the law school. He
reigned as law school dean for
eight years and as interim provost
from Sept. 1, 1993, to June 30,
1994.

J .W. Connolly, incoming chair
of the board of trustees,
approached Nordenberg last
month and asked him if he would
consider assuming the role of
interim chancellor, Nordenberg
said.

A faculty member since 1977,
Nordenberg said that while he has
tried to advance the institution
through each position he’s held,
he had to adjust to the idea of per-
forming the chancellor’s duties.

“This obviously is a special
opportunity to continue those
efforts in a different way,” he
said. “At the same time, it does
require that I retool my life,
because I have spent the past year
refocusing on those things that
are most important to a faculty
member. So while I was very ﬂat-
tered to have been asked, I did
take some time to think about it.”

four years here at Pitt,”
Chapman said. “[Study

lifetime and I couldn’t just
let it pass by.”

the amount of the proposed
tuition increase, he said,
because the university is
aware that some families and
students may not be finan-
cially prepared to pay more.

“It is a concern to us,” he .

said.

“We recently did a survey
of non-returning students to
find out what some of the
contributing factors were as
to why they weren’t coming
back,” Gil said. “Cost was
one of those factors that
showed up in the survey’s
results.”

There may still be a slim
chance that Pitt will receive
more funding, Gil said. The
resolution for the possible
tuition increase will be voted
upon on June 22, when the
full board of trustees has its
next meeting.

“We’re hopeful,” Gil said.
“However, we’ve had no
indication that they’re con-
sidering our request for more
funding.”

Gil said that the 4.5
increase in tuition would
generate $5 million a year
for the university.

The tuition increase would
affect all of Pitt’s 28,
400 full- and part-time stu-
dents, except for the full-
time undergraduate engineer-
ing students, who already
pay $6,316 per year, and
those enrolled in Pitt’s new
undergraduate business
schooL .

If the proposed increase is
approved, it will be installed
for the fall semester.

Opinions

Whose interests here?

Ineffectiveness, unresponsiveness, unaccountability and inac-
cessibility have all plagued the chancellor’s office. There is a
tremendous list of problems at Pitt, and with the recent
announcement that Chancellor O’Connor will leave in early
August, there seems to be no end in sight.

O’Connor’s premature departure from his position was made
because the board of trustees feared the ineffectiveness of a
“lame-duck” chancellor. The decision was a good one;
O’Connor has been inaccessible to the university community
and unreceptive to the decisions of university groups for
months. ~_ .

Two of O’Connor’s more infamous decisions were his han-
dling of the Mount Graham telescope project and the controver-
sy over multiple health care providers for University faculty
and staff. His decision to push for financial support of the
Mount Graham project while so many people objected to the
program raised the question of what interests the chancellor is
supposed serve. The decision to carry only one health care
provider when the university faculty board voted unanimously
to keep both Blue Cross and Health America proved that
O’Connor was certainly not serving the interests of the univer-
sity community. '

‘There are also several issues which directly affect students
and will need to be addressed some time in the near future. The
shortage of on-campus housing for both undergraduate and
graduate students is cited by the master-space plan as a direct
cause of decreased admissions applications to the university.
The shortage also keeps many students from the university who
would otherwise attend Pitt but are unable to find adequate liv-
ing arrangements. Also, the meal plans for students who do live
on campus are a disaster, wasting thousands of dollars because
students are forced to pay set amounts of money for meals they
may or may not eat.

Other problems for Pitt students exist in the lack of comput-
ers available for use. The number of students far exceeds the

V number of computers at this campus, and time is limited so that

there are frequently lines of students at the computer labs dur-

ing,,t_,h_e midterm and final periods.,Library and computer lab

houri§ii’l’7(iespecially during weekends and the summer term) are
insufficient to allow students to use the facilities when they
neepdgtljem. Many of Pitt’s classrooms are antiquated and sorely

need modernization to be adequate. While tuition rates continue

a steady increase, these problems are only being given minimal
attention.

All of the problems mentioned above are ones which will
need some type of resolution in the very near future, and the
next chancellor will be forced to address these issues. The new
chancellor should be one who is able to make difficult deci-
sions in the interests of the university community. Since stu-
dents are so directly affected by the decisions of the chancel-
lor"s office, the students should have input into the decision of
who will fill the position. Also, the new chancellor sh_ould'be
held accountable for his decisions, particularly to the students.
This university belongs to its students and it is time the admin-
istration, especially the next chancellor, addresses the problems
which affect its owners.

major here at
Pitt, but it took
me quite a while to get to this
point.
You see, I was never sup-
posed to be a writer.
In the late 1970s, if you were
black with brains, you were

~ encouraged to consider engi-

neering as a career. I was sup-
posed to attend Carnegie
Mellon University, graduate
with a degree in chemical engi-
neering in 1983 and then make
a lot of money. I was even
enrolled in the Carnegie Mellon
Action Project, a pre-college
program for minority students,
during the summer before my
senior year at Wilkinsburg High
School, which I graduated from
in 1979.

However, problems arose.
First of all, I didn’t want to go
to that small a school; I-wanted
to get out of Pittsburgh; and —
most importantly -—- I made my
worst grades in math and sci-
ence. (I’ve only made one grade
higher than a C since eighth
grade).

I got out of going to CMU by
showing Mom the price tag, a
then-expensive $7,000 per year,
and I couldn’t get financial aid,
so she said, “Pick somewhere
else.” So despite my poor
grades (but with the help of a

.710.SAT math score), I ended

up at Georgia Tech. From the
start I was in over my head, and
I lasted just a year.

My parents were able to pull
some strings to get me into Pitt
the following year, this time as
a chemistry major. Once again
my weaknesses in technical
subjects showed —— it just took
longer. By 1982, not only was I
in danger of flunking out again,

but my mother, a teacher, was
on strike and my parents’ mar-
riage was in trouble. In May of
1983 the university placed me
on academic suspension, and at
the end of August, my -mother
ﬁnally walked out on my father.

Of course, I needed a new
direction, and I knew it had to
be in the humanities or some-
thing similar. Law? No, my
grades were too bad. Political
science? That wasn’t promising
either. Then while becoming
enraged at Jimmy Swaggart on
the TV, it hit me: “You like to
write, and you’re opinionated
— why not become a newspa-
per columnist?” I did write let-
ters to various periodicals, but
my father pretty much shut that
down by demanding to read
everything I wrote. Once, after
reading one phrase he didn’t
like, he threatened to throw me
out of the house!

Actually, I should have
known that I was far better suit-
ed for a career in journalism. I
had written for both the year-
book and the newspaper at
WHS and had always subcon-
sciously studied the media. My
year at Tech, I had written a let-
ter to the campus paper, the
Technique, and afterwards I ran
into the editor at a party, who
recruited me to join the staff. I
wrote sports, and I soon real-
ized that I felt far more com-
fortable in a newsroom or stu-
dio than in a laboratory.

And that has yet to change.

In the spring of 1984, at a
musicians’ fellowship group, I
met Thom and Cathy Hickling,
the publisher and editor respec-
tively of Expression, a local
Christian monthly, and as I had
trouble with the extreme con-
servatism of the paper’s ‘con-
tent, Thom asked me, “Well,
why don’t you write some-
thing?” So I did. Later that year
I wrote an endorsement for
Walter Mondale and another
two years ago for Bill Clinton,
and I handle the Martin Luther
King Jr. celebrations every year
for that paper.

I knew I needed to finish up
at Pitt, so I saw then-CGS Dean
Bolvin to discuss my aspira-
tions, and he pulled out the
requirements for the media
communications major — the
exact program I wanted. Then I
owed money to the university,
and a dear friend of mine (who,
ironically, does have an engi-
neering degree from CMU)
paid it off.

By this time I had already
been writing regularly to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, so in
1986, I joined its now-defunct
Roundtable, a panel of local
residents who offered their per-
spectives on a certain issue. The
next January saw my first paid
column, a tribute to Dr. King.

During the 1992 presidential
campaign I caught a Christian
talk—show host bashing Clinton
almost every day, so I decided
to get on his nerves (remember,
I supported Clinton) by calling
and writing in. It just so hap-
pened that a then-college pro-
fessor and conservative activist
with whom I was correspond-

ing was a regular guest on the T

show and said he’d try to get
me on, and after I sent the host
the column on King, I got the
call. Now I do commentary
every month, live, from a
slightly more liberal perspec-
tive; so far, that’s been my
biggest break. And last
November, I began writing a
column for the Pitt News.

If you would have told me 15
years ago that I’d be doing this,
I’d have given you a strange
look! But I’m having a lot of
fun, people actually soliciting
my opinion about issues, and I
hope I can keep it up. President
Clinton and Oliver North have
nothing on this “comeback
kid”! '

And a great big “thank-you”
to Mom, “Doc,” Beth, Bill and
Mark. I’m gonna make you
proud.

JUNE 71995

Bebop legends and local swingmen

will showcase their jazz for a ten day test

What we get with this year's
Mellon Jazz Festival is not a great
day in Harlem, but more like ten
fine days in Pittsburgh that'll
showcase a formidable collection
of bop musicians who'll pound out
the beat we call jazz. We'll have a
jazz giant to contend with when
Sonny Rollins comes to town, with
his $25 per person price-tag, and
other influential musicians to
check out, such as Tito Puente,
the Trio Three, Al Dowe and Etta
Cox, Kenny Blake, Josh Redman
and many, many others. Some
come with hefty ticket prices, but
there's plenty of free jazz that sim-
ply should not be missed. Walt
Harper willperform for free this
Friday at One Mellon Bank
Center, as will Kenny Blake on the
10th at the Club Cafe, and Tito
Puente on the 18th at Point State
Park. But for a complete schedule
check your local record stores and
other musical venues for Mellon's
brochure. Or call the Mellon's jazz
line at 281-3881. The festival
begins this Friday and runs
through the 18th.

Joe Harris

I guess you could say he’s done
it all. He’s played and recorded
with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie
Parker, Sonny Rollins, Billie
Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald — the list
goes on and on. Which is why
Pittsburgh native and bop drum-
mer Joe Harris makes a perfect
choice for this year’s Mellon Jazz
Festival Honoree.

Being a well-schooled, polished
drummer with excellent technique
earned Harris a spot as one of the
most in—demand musicians
around. In fact, his musical talents
have taken him all over the world.
From Sweden, where he recorded
with Sonny Rollins, to Europe,
where he toured with Quincy
Jones, to Pitt, where he taught
history of jazz for 14 years, Harris
has done it all. Currently, he and
his band, Joe Harris’ Global Jazz
Revue, can be seen at local jazz

venues.

During the Mellon Jazz Festival
Harris and the Revue will be play-
ing at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater, June 15, 8 p.m.. Don’t
pass up this chance to see one of
the true jazz giants of jazz.

Sonny Rollins

Sonny Rollins has been playing
influential jazz on his tenor saxo-
phone for over 50 years. With his
quintet, he’ll demonstrate the
virtues of persistence and a killer
tone.

A bona fide legend, Rollins has
been no stranger to critical praise.
In the '40s, a young Rollins
jammed with such luminaries as
Bud Powell and Fats Navarro. A
few years later, at the ripe age of
23, he honed his chops and
helped make history (and records)
with be-bop pioneers Charlie
Parker, Miles Davis and
Thelonious Monk. Critics and fans
alike marveled over Rollins’ large,
throaty tone, and his rejection of
vibrato articulation. Probably his
most striking feature was his
understanding and ability to devel-
op lavish melodies. Whereas
many be-boppers would improvise
over chordal inversions, Rollins
worked from the songs’ melodies
and used this as a basis for solo-
ing.

His talent was highly show-
cased in recordings on the
Prestigue label, with his album
Saxophone Collosus, being one
the labels finest offerings.
However, jazz was changing
quickly, and "Rollins decided to
take what would become one of
many sabbaticals. In this time,
John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy and
Ornette Colemans‘ groups set the
standard and “freed” jazz up.
Rollins came back from daily
practices on the Williamsburg
Bridge in NYC and recorded with
Ornette Coleman sidemen Billy
Higgins and Don Cherry. Despite
skepticism and strong reaction to
the vanguard from the “old
School,” Rollins proved his melod-
ic conventions were in stride with
the avant-garde.

One of Rollins’ more noted
post-sabbatical recordings was
with John Coltrane. “Tenor
Madness” showcased no matter
how out there a song was, a good
melody could put everything into
perspective. While Coltrane would
unleash his patented “sheets of
sound,” Rollins would lay back
and groove on a coy melody, bal-
ancing the rage of Coltrane. The
contrast is striking and beautiful
and displays the maturity of
Rollins; he knows when to lay
back, he knows when to explode.

Nowadays, Rollins favors the
simpler side of music. His last
album, Old Flames, is a collection
of tried and true jazz standards.
He avoids frantic rambling and

lets his horn sing; every note is A

right on target. Rollins stated, ‘‘I
like to hear Louis Armstrong play
a simple melody  I’m beginning
to search for that real simplicity an
trying to honor it." He does this
without being banal; there's life
and intrigue in his playing, and his
tone is still authoritative.

Joining Mr. Rollins for his
Pittsburgh performances will be
Cliff Anderson on trombone, Kevin
Hayes on piano, Billy Drummond
on drums and Victor Csee-Yuen
on Iatin percussion. This ensem-
ble is versatile and able to handle
any material that Rollins selects
from his massive catalog.

Sonny Rollins performs at the
Regent Theatre in East Liberty
Friday and Saturday, June 16 and
17, at 8:00 p.m. Call 323-1919 for
ticket info.

Roger Humphries

Local jazz drumming guru
Roger Humphries is the man.
Slick as shit on drums, and more.
Like all great jazz musicians, he’s
always looking to get better, even
though he’s an established jazz
king. Humphries gigs regularly at
The Balcony, Club Cafe, James
Street Tavern, Rosebud and the
Manchester Craftmen’s Guild.

Part of what makes Humphries
such a great musician is the band
he surrounds himself with, RH
Factor. Humphries has in his band

not well-known established musi-
cians, but younger more raw play-
ers. Humphries, like Art Blakey
did before, hires these younger
musicians to challenge himself —
to keep him on his toes. He says
they keep him young. Also impor-
tant with this ideology of youth is it
gives the younger musicians a
chance to play in a real jazz set-
ting, something not available in a
classroom. In his bands are such
diamonds in the rough as Don
Aliquo Jr. (tenor sax), Ian Gordon
(trumpet) and Craig Davis (piano).
Under Humphries experienced
leadership, RH factor plays a mix
of awesome straight-ahead hard-
bop tunes.

Don’t miss this Pittsburgh leg-
end when he plays with Ravi
Coltrane (Yes, he’s John's son.)
and Dwayne Dolphin at Club Cafe
Friday, June 9, at 9 p.m. and
Saturday, June 10, at Too Sweet
Lounge in Homewood. Humphries
and RH Factor will be at the
James Street Tavern on the North
Side June 17, 9p.m.

If the $25 price tag on the

bones, the Carnegie MOA may

Jazzers, the Carnegie will screen

don't miss the bop, jazz and
swing that can be had on film.

A Great Day in Harlem

Considered one of the most
important photographs of the
jazz era (see photo left), Art
Kane's photograph of 57 swing-
men outside a Harlem brown-
stone provides the crux for Jean
Bach's jazz documentary A
Great Day in Harlem. Bach, a
longtime jazz fan and radio pro-
ducer, began the project in 1989
without any filmmaking experi-
ence. What she did know was
jazz, and lots of jazz musicians.
A film very much told from the
musicians’ points of view, with
voice-over only used as an intro,
Bach primarily used a lot of sam-
ples with the film's soundtrack
and interviews with performers to
talk about the '50s jazz scene.

“The photo happened just by
accident,” Bach said. “Esquire

had had very little jazz coverage
for years." When Esquire hired
Robert Benton as the new arts
editor, the mag became more hip
to bop. Benton then hired Art
Kane to assemble and photo-
graph New York City's finest jazz
musicians. Kane then roused 57
musicians together for a shoot at
10 in the morning. “Benton got
Art Kane, who had never taken a
picture, because he knew that he
was just hip about jazz,” Bach
said. ‘‘It was Kane who came up
with this bonehead idea —-
shooting all these night people at
10 a.m.” You'll find such jazz leg-
ends as Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonius Monk, Charles
Mingus, Art Blakey, Count Basie
and many, many others in the
photo and in Bach's film.

Funny Bones

Directed by Peter Chelsom
With Oliver Platt, Jerry Lewis,
Leslie Cam and Oliver Reed

There are two types of comedi-
ans: one who tells funny and one
who is funny. Either you have
funny bones or you don’t. If you
don’t have funny bones you tell
funny, and if you do have them,
boy are you lucky, because you
simply are funny, and that’s some-
thing which can never be learned.
Hence, the premise for Peter
Chelsom’s new dark comedy,
Funny Bones.

Funny Bones stars Oliver Platt
as Tommy Fawkes, a comedian
burnt out from trying his whole life
to match up to the likes of his
father, the great comedian George
Fawkes (Jerry Lewis). After being
shown up yet another time by his
father in his debut act at a ritzy
Las Vegas hotel, Tommy heads to
Blackpool, England, with a new
identity in search of an act he can
call (or purchase to be) “his Own.”

 

The godfather of pizza lives at Gullifty's. Chicago
style, stuffed with 3 cheeses and spices, topped
with chunky sauce and MORE cheese! Plus,
"stuffers" to mix, match or build your Own.

The luregto Blackpool is” some-
thing personal for Tommy. The
camera takes us on a visual trip
on Tommy's ride from the airport
into Blackpool. Shots of young
girls bending over in not-so-long
dresses, and old women on park
benches wrapping their tongues
around ice-cream cones create
the picture of this bizarre town
which always wears a smile, even
though crooked at times.

Funny Bones delves into
the world of all types of comedians
in an interesting way. (Be sure to
notice Oliver Reed’s small but piv-
otal role — kind of bizarre for him.)
From the Parker brothers clowns
(played by Freddie Davies and
George Carl, a legendary clown)
to a bagpipe paying dwarf, you get
the chance to see hordes of com-
edy acts. Whether or not you find
the stuff funny probably depends
on who you are, or perhaps what
kind of bones are lurking in your
own body. ’

Funny Bones opens this Friday, -

June 9, at the Rex Theater. Call

Romeo and Juliet
Directed by Laura Ann Worthen

Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival ’

For me, it was the balcony
scene.

Talking with three of my room-
mates after the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival’s perfor-
mance of Romeo and Juliet, one
asked me which was my favorite
scene. The balcony scene was my
choice because it embodied the
decisions Artistic Director Laura
Ann Worthen made for this season
of “Theatre Unchained.” During
the scene, Juliet is pouring out her
heart to the audience from a
canopy bed while Romeo, also
facing the audience, hears, and is
overcome by her unbridled emo-
tion. The more flowery selections
of verse are brushed over, and the
emphasis is placed on the basest
of feelings they hold for each
other. -

The core of what Shakespeare
tried to connect with in all of us is
right there physically reaching out
to us. It was the most satisfying
balcony scene I can remember,
and there wasn’t even a balcony

to speak of.

The set had an upscale decon-
structed facade to it, with simple
black scaffolding, and immense,
illuminated (kudos to the lighting
designers) gauzy curtains with
modern female voices, Annie
Lennox and Melissa Etheridge
among the select, caressing
them. The period setting is still
effective with -all of the ‘90s over-
tones and comparisons evident in
our own culture obsessed with
both romance and violence. Friar
Laurence’s cell is moves on and
off stage as if someone had a
huge mouse and clicked to a new
window. The destruction of the
ballroom proved wild, while the

,Mantua set served as comic

relief. (It was supposed to, wasn’t
it?)

Kristin Sentman’s Juliet: play-
fully innocent while remarkably
strong. In stressing her youth, her
integrity was never sacrificed and
her decisions, however rash they
were, always came off as deliber-
ate. She was not a bubble-gum
teen, crazy in love like some
afterschool special (see Zefferelli
version); her position as misun-
derstood by her family and the
depth of her passion appeared
certain.

The character of Romeo, since
I first read the play, has always
seemed contrived. I mean,
Shakespeare lets us see the
inconstancy of his infatuation with
Rosaline. -After witnessing Tom
Lee’s Romeo, I tried really hard to
imagine anyone else ever having
performed the role. While that
may seem a little gratuitous, I’ve
seen a number of Romeos in my
brief lifetime — on and off the
stage —— and I can’t remember
anyone who could look as natural
at something as the actual-act of

6

falling in love. His physical and
vocal intensity made Romeo, a
character who is often overdone,
very human for me.

Jennifer A. Pennington was an
amusing nurse, and Arthur
Pearson’s Lord Capulet served as
a savagely dramatic foil, especial-
ly in the scene when he com-
mands Juliet that she must marry
Paris. My only minor disappoint-
ment with the production was the
glossing over of the characters of
Mercutio and Tybalt, major play-
ers in the drama. I don’t know if it
was deliberate artistic choice, but
the setting of hate should have
been as intense throughout all of
their scenes together, not only the
fight scenes.

Overall, the production was
entertaining, insightful and
included inventive touches like
the string of lightbulbs when
Mercutio and Co. go over the wall
in Act I and the adolescent journal
Juliet carries with her everywhere
in the house of Capulet —— until
the night she and Romeo make
love. This production left such an
impression of the lovers’ growing
maturity that the sensuality is
heightened in scenes which could
have been sacrificed as purely
sexual. Hands, and the sensation
of touch, are used as the play-
wright must have intended. The
sensitivity and devotion Worthen
holds for this work is evident in
every scene, and the entire pro-
duction appears something of a
labor of love.

The Minnesota Twins, among

fewer than 10,000 fans per home

I can think of another team,

Some of you know there’s a

Did you know that’s where Pitt’s

From what this season’s atten-

didn’t.

At a university made up of
26,328 graduate and undergradu-
ate students, the highest number
of people that attended a home

Five times only 25 were there.
On the average, home atten-

These ntunbers are misleading, S

because the composition of actu-

Fletcher nabs I III1 All-Ame

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

For football there are bowl
games. For baseball there is
Omaha and the World Series.
For basketball there is March
Madness and the Final Four.
And, for track there is -— the
Final Four? *

“It’s the greatest meet in
the country,” said track
coach Steve Lewis about the
NCAA Outdoor Track and
Field Championships. “It’s
like the Final Four.”

Actually, it’s more like the
Final Eight, with the top
eight in each event receiving
All-America status, and the
winner is named national
champion.

The athletes qualify for the

Championships by being in,

the top 24 in the country for
their event.

“It was an extremely_com—
petitive meet,” Lewis said.
“There were meet and stadi-
um records broken. It was
probably the best I’ve attend-
ed, and I’ve been going since
1981.”

And speaking of the best,
Najuma Fletcher, who has
competed in every indoor
and outdoor national champi-
onship since her freshman
year, added to her long list of
accolades by raising her
school—record eight All-
American honors to 11 after
just her junioryear.

“It’s not a record, it’s phe-
nomenal,” said Lewis.

Fletcher qualified for the .

meet in the high jump, long
jump, triple jump and hep-

' tathlon. She did not compete

in the heptathlon, but chose
instead to focus on her other
three events.

In the high jump, she tied
for second and set a school

record with jump of 6—feet,
3—inches. From there it was
on to the triple jump and a
third place finish after a leap
of 44-feet, 5 1/2-inches.
Fletcher then notched her
third All-American honor of
the weekend with a seventh
place finish in the long jump
(20-feet,’l 3/4 inches).

Fletcher concluded the sea-
son ranked No. 2 in the coun-
try in the triple jump and
third in the high jump.

She has qualified for the
World Championships in
these two events and in the
heptathlon, but she isn’t sure
what she’ll compete in yet.

“It depends on what she
feels like_ she’ll do best in,”
said Lewis.

The other member of the
women’s team who competed
was sophomore Angie Martin
in the 400 hurdles. She
placed fourth in her heat with
a time of 58.48, but missed
qualifying for the finals and
settled for 12th position

overall. This was Martin’s'

third appearance in an
NCAA Championship.

The members of the men’s
team didn’t fare as well as
the women, running much
slower than their qualifying
times. None of the three
made it to the finals.

Even though they didn’t
make it to the finals, coach
Lewis said that they are some
of the best athletes in the
country and are in the top 24
for their events.

Dietrich Jells placed sev-
en_th in his heat of the 100-
meters with a time of 10.71
and also placed seventh in
his heat for the 200-meters
with a time of 21.48. A

Hoops recruits, Cummings, Hawkins pass SATS

Ralph Willard’s vaunted incoming fresh-
man class has drawn several comparisons
to Pitt’s class of 1989 — a class that
snagged five high school‘ studs, none of
whom were eligible to play their freshman
year.

Those comparisons can be put to rest.

making him eligible to play next year.
Isaac Hawkins, a 6-foot-8 forward, also
passed.

“We had conﬁdence they would make it
all along,” assistant basketball coach Sean
Cleary said. “We knew first and foremost
that they are all quality kids who are very
directed and goal-oriented.”

Cummings, Hawkins, Michael Gill and
Andrae Howard are all eligible for next
year. The lone recruit who has yet to pass
is Pitt’s latest signee, 7-footer Mark
Blount. But'Cleary says he’s confident that
Blount will pass.

Cummings, a second team USA Today
All-American, is the major cog in Pitt’s
class that Bob Gibbons, a renowned high
school talent scout, ranked as the fifth best
in the nation. ‘

“He’s a big piece to the puzzle,” Cleary
said. “The great thing about Vonteego is
he’s so versatile — he’s a combo-guard
that plays both positions.” »

Cummings, a 6-3 guard from Thomson,
Ga., is ranked as a top 10 guard in the
country and a top 20 prospect overall.

“Vonteego is especially dedicated and
focused,” Cleary said. “He’s an all-around
winner.”

Hawkins, a 6-8 athletic forward from
Baton Rouge, La., is a great rebounder
although he’s on the thinner side, Cleary
said.

The stock of‘ Gill, a 6-6 forward/guard
from the tradition-laden Dumbar High
School in Washington, continues to rise.
He has been cited as the 32nd best player

in the country. -

“People are ﬁnally seeing what Mike car
do,” Cleary said. “He has a complete
game. He’s a legitimate 6-6 with grea
perimeterskills and a great defender. He’:
a classic winner and an unbelievable kid.”

The scores of Cummings and Hawkin:
came on the heels of another of Willard’:
recruits from last year, who passed tw<
weeks ago, Kellii Taylor. Taylor, a 6-foo‘
guard, didn’t pass his SATs last year, so he
went to the famed Maine Central Pre;
School. He led the team in scoring witl
19.4 points a game with 4.5 assists.

“He’s a scorer,” Cleary said. “He finds 1
way to score, he’s got a scorer’s mentality.’-

It’s safe to say now Willard’s 1995 clas:
is nothing like the ex-Pitt coach Pau
Evan’s 1989 class, a class that brought it
Eric Mobley, Chris McNeil, Jama
Faulkner, Danny Griffin and Dominic
Dumancic. Only Mobley an.d McNei
stayed to their senior years. Faulkner, on:
of the top players in the country at th<
time, went toprep school and then bailec
to Arizona State. This year, he ended hi:
collegiate career at Alabama. Griffin alst
never came to Pitt, and Dumancic trans-
ferred to Slippery Rock after one year.
