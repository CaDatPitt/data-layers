Pitt Voted
Engineers’
Center

ExpansionPlanned
Throughout City

Last ‘week officers of the
ﬁve major engineering socie-
ties in the nation voted Pitts-
burgh as their new home.

Over ‘a year ago, Pitt ﬁrst _

appeared with an offer which
helped clinch the deal. The
Board of Trustees offered to
provide a suitable site for the
proposed engineering build-

ing adjacent to the campus if a 10- '

cation in Oakland seems desirable.

Along with Pitt’s offer, another
factor in swinging the head-
quarters to Pittsburgh was a city
promise to build a ‘Municipal
Auditorium which could accom-
modate large meetings. Another
hotel to accommodate the large in-
crease in visitors has been pro-
posed in Gateway Center.

Population to Increase

The move to Pittsburgh needs
only to be formally approved by
the vote of the societies. Then, the
present headquarters in New York
will‘ be abandoned and the staff
of oﬁice workers and skilled pro-
fessional experts will move and
increase population here by sev-
eral thousand.

The societies which will move
to their new home are: Ameri-
can Institute of Electrical E_gni-
neers, American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers, American
Society of Civil engineers, Am-
erican Society of Mining and
Metallurgical Engineers, and the
American Institute of Chemical
Engineers.

The proposed building to house
the society would consist of 180,-
000 square feet, 14 stories high
and would cost $6,000,000. Pitts-
burgh would then be established
as the center of engineering as
well as that of industrial and
medical research. Added prestige
will be given to Pitt and other
district schools and a probable
gain in student enrollment will
result from having the nation’s

engineering center in Pittsburgh. ‘

Business to Increase

The site for the engineering
center was fought for by most of
the large cities. Businessmen real-
ized that having the headquarters
in their city would increase hotel,
restaurant, and store‘ income. In
addition, several million. more will
be spent in railroad and air travel
annually.

However, when the officers an-
nounced their decision Philadel-
phia tripled its original offer of
$500,000 to match an offer made
by civic and business leaders in
Pittsburgh. The head of 1 the
Philly movement, H. 1’. Liver-
sidge, said his group would even
go higher in its offer to the so-
cieties to help build a head-
quarters there.

They included in the oﬁer a six-
acre site near the University of
Pennsylvania. Three colleges in
Chicago have also expressed their
desire to have the building of the
societies located on their cam-
puses.

Students who wish to work
on the Pitt News staff may
ﬁll out applications at 825 C1.
Positions are open for news
and sports writers, photogra-
phers, copy readers in the edi-
'torial department and person-
nel on the business staff.

Petitions for the organization of

, recognized student political parties

have been given by the Dean’ of
Men’s Oﬁice for a Veterans-In-
dependent. Party and a Panther
Party.
A third group composed- of last
year’s Pitt P_arty leaders has not
acted, as yet, but are expected to
circulate a petition, soon. These,
and other embryo parties, must
return their petitions by Mar. 20
signed by 200 members 1
Purpose Stated
Joe Banik, president of the Pitt
Independent Association, and
David M. Guyol, member of the
Pitt Veterans Association, are the
organizers of the Vet-Independent
party. The purpose of the organi-
zation which is advised by D. G.
Schindler, electrical engineering
instructor, and Dr. Joseph Zas-
loff, assistant professor of political
science, appears on their petitions
as:
To give the independent stu-
dent a chance to participate in
student government; to ‘co-'
ordinate independent, fraternity,
and veteran personnel into a
functioning group to promote
the best interests of the group
and the University.
They are accepting’ membership
fees of 15-25 cents. The purposes

. of the group are to represent a

cross-section of all the students.
’ According to Guyol, the Vet-
Independent group is interested
in “the general student welfare,
not whether a man is fraternity
or independent or veteran.”
Banik explained his role in the
organization of the party. “It’s al-
ways been my ambition to give
the vets and independents a
chance to be elected. They will
now have someone to back them.”.
The panther party is being or-
ganized by Dan Levitt, Joe Trat-

Men’s Council, Paul Balles, Chest
er Zukowski, Yale Rosenstein,
Lynn Watson, Bill Lane, Art
Vogel, Bob Timmons, John Ched-

“He guides the destinies of an

what Temple University means to

Trattner explained the slow de-

to take our time and organize
something that will be of Value
to all. We want it to appeal to
every student who has an interest,
be he fraternity, independent, or
veteran.”

Levitt described the parties
organization as a mission “to
ﬁght apathy.” According to
Balles” the basic aim of the
patty" is to place politics on a
high level such as it enjoys in
the community.” ‘

Bob Wilkens is “quite, conﬁdent
that we will present something to
the student body that will beneﬁt
the school!” ,

The Pitt Party is not officially
organized. The fate of that group

‘ will be decided at a meeting to be

attended by such members of last
year’s party as Stan Greenﬁeld,

Perry, and Emil Herman.

They will probably decide
form the third party, but there is
the possibility that they will
throw their strength to one of the
other groups.

Jack Caldwell J r.
Holds Down 7 Jobs

In and Around Pitt
By THOMAS C. VRANA

If a day had more than 24 hours,
you can be sure that John T. Cald-

. well, Jr., editor of the 1955 Owl,

student yearbook, would ﬁnd
something to do to ﬁll them. He
has one ofthe busiest schedules in
the University.

A seniortin the college“ Caldwell
holds down the following posi-
tions: editor of the 1955' Owl; di-
rector and ﬂoor manager for
WQED; air force wing photogra-
pher; public information ofﬁcer
for Arnold Air Society; vice-pres-
ident of Pi Delta Epsilon, honor-
ary journalism fraternity; official
photographer for Pitt Players; and
assistant teacher in Dr. D. E.
Swarts’ Journalism 62 class.

As if this weren’t enough to keep
him busy he also plans to produce
a live show for WQED on how to
play chess, called “It’s Your
Move.” , .

Caldwell said he hopes that
“the yearbook will be an All-
American. We have the best
theme possible—-“The World at
Pitt.” He backed his A1l-Amer-
ican claim by stating that the
1955 Owl “will be the ﬁrst pub-
lication at the University to ex-
hibit the photographs of the 18
nationality rooms in full color.”

Two applicationsfor the formation of political parties

have already been handed out and a_ third

group is ex-

of next week. If efforts of each suggested faction are suc-

cessful, we will have a concrete record of six

dents who will have shown an interest in elections. at least

Bookstoie Blu

By Cecy Linceff

Recently, there appeared in the Pitt News, an
article by this" reporter on the prices in the ‘Pitt
Bookstore as compared with those in the Carnegie
Tech Bookstore.

For sometime before and since the penning of
that piece, means and groans were heard all over
the University with regard to the pric 1 charged
in the bookstore. ........ .. _ _ ........... ..

It seems that theiPitt stu-
dents feel that they’re not being
treated fairly by their school.
They all say that they’ll go to
Tech to buy their supplies.

Tech doesn’t want Pitt stu-
dents to buy at their bookstore.
They buy only enough supplies

you can’t blame them. There’s no .
reason why Tech should supply two Universities’

, students ewith books.

Why then doesn’t Pitt lower their prices and
give the student body a break? One reason ex-
plained by the comptroller is the difference in the
tuition charged by the two schools. _

Tech has a ﬂat rate, while Pitt charges per
Credit The idea that Pitt raised its tuition fee last
September seems to have added to the complaints
of distraught Pittites, also. e _

.Nevertheless, Pitt claims that their proﬁt from
the bookstore goes into a University fund-—but there

it stops. No one can seem to ﬁnd out-where’ it
goes from the fund.

It couldn’t go to the new building program,-' 0

that’s being granted by various groups and in-
dividuals.

Perhaps then, it ‘goes to the improvement of

' student facilities. Yet, the Tuck Shop is still dull,
the cafeteria ‘still barren and slovenly. .

The bookstore itself is too small, service is poor,
not due, by any means, to the personnel, but
rather the space..

When these things are mentioned, the subject
of the Student Union is brought up. That’s grand.
Pitt can certainly use a central place for its stu-
dents to gather. But in how many years will the
proposed building appear? 0 C

From the looks of the plans, it doesn’t seem

that the present group of Pittites will be able to‘

reap the harvest of a luxurious Student Union.

It’s true that Pitt is not the only school to be
complained about. Tech has its share of gripes
too. Yet, an effort is shown by their administra-
tion. Prices are cut ten per cent belowilist price
in the bookstore.

Evidence that at least an attempt is being made
for Tech’s profit to go to student facilities is seen
in the newly remodeled bookstore. '

They also have dormitories which must be kept
in good condition for the students’ beneﬁt.

Some steps should be taken by «the University
of Pittsburgh to justify its budget to the student

.body. After all, look who’s paying.

Shulman and the Student

By Nancy “Jones

The scene—-—a typical classroom
in ‘a typical ivy—covered build-
ing on a typical campus. My
subject——“On Campus with Max
Shulman,” of course. Max’s col-
umn has become an institution
to the “little
man on cam-
pus” clad in
deformed hat
and v-neck
sweater in in-
s t i t u t i o n s
throughout the

' country.

And no won-
der—Max has
made quite a
study of col-
lege students.
He’s been collecting

them for
years! Rumor says he has over ,
4000 specimens piled up in his
basement. . ‘

If you read his column with a
knowing and discerning eye, a
sudden burst of enlightenment
will show you what Max consid-
ers the development of the col-
lege student.

Freshmen—ah, those poor
green, young innocents. They
come to college with a valise
packed full of refreshing, new
attitudes. They stand in awe of
registration, frat rushing, and

BM&WOCS. They are eager for

knowledge and friendship. Max
says no one can become quite so

 

“lovesick’.’, or “moonstruck” as a
freshman. They study hard, take’
copious lecture notes, and get
good grades.

But not the sophomores. They
are men who can “take intelli-
gence or leave it alone.” And
they usually leave it alone, be-

cause by now they have all they .

need. Of course, by now Joe
College has acquired a quarter-
inch h a i r c uit, black-rimmed
glasses, a collegiate-looking pipe,
and a deformed hat. The key
word in fashions is “casual,” or
that “beat-up” look. Sophomores
are frat men who blush to admit
that in their freshman year they
were “dull, stodgy and normal.”
They think the present tense of
wrought‘ is wreet, won’t attempt

square roots because they aren’t

square.

Juniors, says Max, live in
a perpetual state of need—
need of money, need of lecture
notes, need of romances, need of
beer. Juniors have at last de-
cided upon a chief interest—gir1s.
They have turned into “or'inni-
vores of prodigious appetite.” It
is not wise to leave food about
when they are present. They like
to go to classes once in a while.
It breaks up the day. But, have
no fear, they have got Max’s
message. “College can be beau-
tiful. Don’t louse it up with
studying.”

Juniors have learned not to

Got a  Ma’rch?i

By Paul Harrison

That blue tobacco haze that
has been hanging over these
United States, for 10 these many
years, is showing signs ofbeing
pierced or at least being ﬁltered.

In» tune with the numerous
medical reports and independent
surveys that have been bandied
about extolling untold ‘grief on
the cigarette industry, Consum-
ers Reports has published the
summation of the facts and

ideas, consists of an increasing
movement of worried smokers to
switch from regular length
cigarettes to the king size and

keep up with the increased de-
mand the industry introduced no
less than 19 new‘ types, all of
either king size or ' ﬁlter tip,
‘eleven of them were both. t

fast growing ﬁlter brands. Pall

now holds 13% of the market. -.
In the process of the change
theicigarette industry showed a
drop of 4% in sales in the ﬁrst
nine months of 1954.

West Virginia’s Mountaineers at Morgantown tomorrow even-

Another or Harrick’s charges-
who has met with tremendous suc-
cess in the n at world is Bob Perry
who goes at 123 pounds. Perry is
a four-year‘ veteran and usually
comes out on the top end of the
score. Thus it will take a supreme
effort on the part of _Bill Hulings
to start the Peerymen on the way
totheir fifth successive triumph.

Ed DeWitt of Washington are the
only other locals that have yet to

sowen Should
Learn Spanish

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

Spanish isn’t one of Arnie So_well’.s courses this semester
but well it might be. , -

The slender runner from Schenley High will probably
learn some Spanish in another month if he attends the Pan-
American games at Mexico City, Mexico. Right now, he

stands a very good chance of makingthe team as he _is one’

of the leading middle-distance runners in the United States
and the NCAA 880‘champ. . I

The committee in charge of selection will make their
choices known in the coming two weeks and Arnie looks like
a sure bet.

During this winter he has been making a name for him-

self along the Eastern coast, winning meets in New York
and Boston. This past Saturday at Madison Square Garden,
Sowell topped the ﬁeld in the Matt Halpin
half-mile run and a couple weeks back, he
did the same in the 600-yard run at the Bos-
ton Athletic Association Games.

His coach, Carl Olson, has the utmost
conﬁdence in him and just beams at is men-
tion. “He’s one of the best I’ve ever had,”
comments the veteran Panther mentor. How
Olson feels toward Sowell was shown in the

semester recess. Sowell was entered in ﬁve
events, a very rare and difficult task in col-
lege track today. I ’ V ,

But the sensational Sowell came through. He took a
ﬁrst in the 600 and 1000 yard runs, anchored both the half
and mile relay teams to victory, and took a third in the
broad jump. .

Olson wouldn’t compare him to Johnny Woodrulf, Pitt’s
great runner of the late thirties, because he says, “Arnie is
not as big or strong as Woodruff and he’s still young. Wood-
ruff was a couple years older when he
he commented. .

 

Sowell

Sowell, who became a ﬁrst-semester junior with the

clrfange of semesters, runs again tomorrow‘ at the «National
AAU meet in New -York,iwhere the Pan-American commit-
tee will undoubtly watch him inaction. '

If they take the word of Jim Kelly, Chairman of the U. S.
Olympic--Track and Field Committee, though, he’ll go for
sure. Kelly describes him as “the "greatest half-miler of all-

time,” which makes a 1956 Olympic bid look to be in the

offing for Arnie Sowell. - ~

Swimmers Swee All Events a

In Victory Over Mountaineers

 By AL PELAEZ
Ben Grady’s tankers swamped the West Virginia Moun-
taineers 59-23 last Wednesday at Morgantown, sweeping all

ten ﬁrst places in the process.

The Mountaineers were never in the contest as they con-
tinued on their losing ways. West Virginia has yet to win

a meet in two years of collegiateé

competition. ,

The Blue and Gold started off
by coping the 300—yard medley re-
lay and were never headed. The
evenly-balanced Panthers split
theirwins among seven men, with
only Skip Monsein having more
than one first place. Bill Furrer,
Warne White, Bert Marks, Ben
Sklar, Roy Kaupe, and Jim Zurch-
er were the other winners.

In the process of out-pointing

the Mountaineers, three Panthers
broke West Virginia pool records.
Wilkinsburg’s Furrer broke the

'record for the 220-yard freestyle
‘with a fast time of 2:l9.7, Schen-

ley’s Monsein set a new mark in
the individual medley winning in
1:48, and Oliver’s Zurcher turned
in a time of 5:02.2 in the 440—yard
freestyle.

The victory ‘raised the mermenis
record to 5-4,‘ with two meets re-

maining on the schedule. They ,

now have more than a week to

prepare for their next meet with ,

Lehigh Feb.”26. . .
With only‘ two more tmeets be-
fore the Eastern Collegiates, an
appraisal of the Panthers shows
that they have a good chance of
successfully defending their title.

iAlthough_ they were hit hard by

graduation this year, several boys
have come through to make the

"team dangerous. Heading this list

is Zurcher, who will be out to de-
fend his 220 and - 440-yard titles

‘which he won last year as la‘soph-

omore. Furrer is expected to be
Zurcher’s closest competitor in the
distance events. Backstroker Mon-
sein also has shown very well, as
Roy. Kaupe.

Undaunted by the loss of their

Wiley, Fusia  
Get Grid Jobs

There had been rumors all along
that Coach Johnny Michelosen
might go to the pros for his assist-
-ant coaches and when ex-Steele!‘
Jack Wiley was named to the line
mentor’s post Tuesday, no one
was too surprised.

Wiley’s appointment followed
closely behind the announcement

that Vic Fusia of Brown Univers-
ity would become backﬁeld coach.

In the four years since he has

left the Steelers, Wiley has been ‘

head grid tutor at Waynesburg
College—his alma mater. At
Waynesburg, Wiley won 22, lost
nine and-tied one. During his ﬁve
years as a Steeler, the last three
under Michelosen, Wiley was'a
2015-pound starting tackle.

Fusia, a four-letter man at
Manhatten College, comes to Pitt
from Brown where he has been
backﬁeld coach the past four sea-
sons. With him, Fusia brings a
reputation as being somewhat of
a magician with his quarterbacks.
The signal-callers hove completed
better than 50% of their passes
during Fusia’s fdur-years at
Brown.

After graduating from Wilkins-‘V

burg High School in 1932 where

he played three years of varsity‘

football, Fusia went on to become
a senior
selection in 1937.
