'5 -’ i V’ Graduate Manager of Athletics. ~ 3 ._ ' - .

For a -‘number of years, it has been the custom for the Graduate
Manager of Athletics to_ give thealumni a forecast of-the coming foot-
ball’ season in the last issue of “The Pitt Weel_A(A_|;Y-i” and we are very"
‘glad. to continue the custom this year. Football plays such a vital
part in the life of the University, -and .is doing so much to advertise,‘
the University, not considering the ﬁnancial help which it has given-
directly to Alumni Hall and other sources, that the interest on .the
part of the alumni, students, faculty, e_tc., does not seem to be out.

» 7 _ of__ proportion. . '

. It is pretty generally known that the UVniyersity,Athletic' Council
at the time of the Alumni Hall drive subscribed a sum of $150,000’ »
toward the building, ‘this to be provided from the proﬁts of football..

  To date $120,000 of this amount has been taken care of-, $92,000 in

cash and notes aggregating $30,000 being carried, and the balance
' ‘being in the form of a pledge‘ which will eventually be taken care of.
It is doubtful if any school ‘in the United States which supports foot-
ball,-Acan show a record- like this. Certainly. it offset any cry of com- _
Amercialism in football, so far as Pitt is concerned. The $100,000,‘
approximately, which has been turned over to Alumni Hall_to help
‘-provide a building. for recitation purposes,:could very easily have
been put in the athletic program, for instance, in aA»gym-nasium or;
something of- that sort. The athletic authorities realized, however.
how badly Alumni Hall was needed on" the campus and in the crisis
they sacriﬁced other things for it. ' 3 ‘

_ Football, perhaps more than ‘anything else brings about commu-

: ‘. nity interest in the University. 'Not only are the alumni, students-

‘and other Pittites interested, but Pittsburghers generally- Men who

A‘ ‘would possibly never think of the Universityare attracted_by it at
. thetime of the football season, and his interest has greatly increased

as the years go by. Almost every prominent man in Pittsburgh, from
. the Mayor-down, likes football, and when they attend thegames and
see the immense crowds which come out, they naturally have the
‘ . importance of the institution emphasized_on them. ‘ '
» " ‘ NEXT EASON

With this little Introduction we will now proceed to give some
‘concrete facts regarding the next football season. No ‘doubt many
‘alumni have been discussing the recent action of Athletic’ Council in A

.A,deciding on the strict. application of the three-year rule without-‘any.
Jnodification, which not only Odebarred Captain:-_eAlect -Bowser, Jack
‘ Sack and Cullen Gouerley, three star-football men, but also prevents
no less_ than six or. eight starsA in other branches-of~ athletics from.‘ a’
competing their fourth year. The facts regarding this have already
1 been pointed out in recent issues of “TheA Weekly," but will bear re-V

;,:Sack, Bowser and Gourley entered- the University‘ in September, .
-1919, at which, time the three-year rule was not in effect, although. the I
one-year residence rule was. In April, 1920, the three-year rule was

2.  %put in effect, there being a modificaAtion..to”the effect that i't.Awould not

A apply to men then enrolled in school. This meant that under the rule
 these three men were eligible. Both Bowser. and Sack graduate this
-A year from Economics and-plan to enter Law School. Gourley was.
" already enrolled there’ and received .hisA__unde‘rgraduate d_egree.. AlAu_mni
should understand '-that the‘-Economics-Law course is a combined»
course, the undergraduate ‘degree being given after: four years of
_same,as a_ College-Medical .man-- gets‘ his BS. degree after
"two years-in Medical School. A _: _ _ A A
For some time it has been felt by the athletic authorities who

were close in touch with. the college_athletics situation in _Western
Pennsylvania, and in fact all over the United States that Pitt would
occupy a much better position in her ‘relation with other schools and
be in better position to insist on stricter .eligibility_rule_s on the part
ofrivals if the three-year rule without any m_odi_ficat_ion -whatever

A were adopted.’ This rule is strictly adhered to in the Western Con":

13- ference schools, at Cornell and other institutions of the East, which 

' are on the top notch, as regards eligibility. Pitt wanted to be in this
class‘, and a decision was made, therefore, to apply the three-year rule.
. at once, ‘even if it was necessary- to..sac_rifice_ thl‘.ee_ Sta!‘ Pe|‘f°|‘mel‘5-
It is aworthyof note that many. of the representatives of‘the large

  institutions referred to have written letters complimenting Pitt on her

action, and it_'has met with aprpoval of practically-all the alumni.‘

'students and‘ others who look‘.-at the University first, -in C0l1Sld8I"Il"l§‘ _
A Even with the loss of__these three men, Pitt's football prospects

‘do not -look so bad. It is not the -purpose ofthisarticle to paint a .

' ' pthe athletic activities.’

 -‘ rosy picture of what‘ the team is ‘going to do next fall, "because it is. .

admitted the line might look better. Pitt- teamslhave a habit of rising

- zsitoe great heights jmemergencies, however, and while one or two games
,' _may‘ bedroppd ne_xt.f,all, the season will certainly not be a failure.

Duringfthepast season, which was one of the most successful in his- "
tory, several defeats were encountered, but these tended to spur the .
team on rather than to discourage it. Final,,victories» over W. &_ J.‘

"-3 and State. climaxed some wonderful performances and the men came

"through whohad really‘ not been counted-on for unusual .work.i Who
_.would havethought, for instance, at the start of the‘ season that;
‘ =.Charlie-Winterbjurn, who had been subbing for several ‘years, would

; Tcome throug'h'"with a .brilliant' performance and‘play varsity quarter-

back in'the big games with W. & -J. and State? There will, no doubt,

’ . ing’ye‘ar, and Bucknell will probably do likewise".

A - The schedule; is without doubt the-hardest" ever undertaken by‘a
_ University team, and to ask the- coachesto go through‘ without defeat
fwould be ridiculous. As pointed-out above, Pitt is not-lookingto‘ vic-
_tories ‘alone and will be satisfied with a fair season- with a ﬁghting
aggregation of 38 men, an unexcelljed coaching staff and real Pitt
spirit back of the- whole organization, a fair season can certainly be
looked for, and anyonewho ﬁgures that the team is wrecked by-‘the ‘

application of the strict three-year rule is badly m‘ist,aken..e The sched-ii’.

This is a very im-

in effect. ' l . ' . ' . —
_ A . JTHE COACHES ‘ A
_ Thecoaching staff» will bethe same as last year, Glenn S. (“Pop")
Warner being head coach and being-assisted by J. P. (“Pat”) Herron,
Floyd Rose and Alex. Stevenson. Herron, who was head coach of. the
University _of_ Indiana last fall, comes back to Alma Mater after a
year's absence.’ He-is ansattorney in’ Pittsburgh and did notdesire
to" leave here,-the work as assistant coach under Warner just suiting '
his plans. Pat is well liked by the fellows and has their respect. He
should be all the better this year after his year ‘of training at Indiana
- when he "was up against the Western Conference teams.’ Warner will '
undoubtedly try to make this season one of his -best, and he has-.-as-
sured the writer that he ‘has beénthinking and dreaming of football»
. continuously. He, will be succeeded next year by Dr. J. B. (“Jock")
Sutherland, Dent. '18, who will continue this year as head coach at

. . . A _ A THE_“FROSH" " I .

The Freshman" team will he coached again by Dr. H. C. (“Red”)
Carlson, oneof Pitt's famous athletes”. Carlson coached the yearlings
last yearwith great success. The scheduleis as follows: Saturday,
October.13, West Virginia Freshmen at Pit_tsburgh; Saturday, October

- 20, Syracuse Freshmen at Syracuse; Saturday, October 27, Carnegie

 Tech Freshmen at Forbes Field; Saturday,’ November 3, Bellefonte .

Academy at-Bellefonte; Saturday, November 10, Penn State Freshmen
at Forbes" Field; Saturday,-Novem.ber 17, Kiski School ‘at Pittsburgh.

It will be noted that the West Virginia -Freshmen and. Tech .
Freshmen will perform at Forbes Field. on the days their varsity
teams play here. ’Syraouse.'AFreshm.en are played at Syracuse while
the varsity is meeting the Orange University in New York, _3e||e.
fonte Academy is to‘ be played at Bellefonte while the varsitylis at

.A Pennsylvania, and State Freshmen are a preliminary to the Grove
‘City-Varsity game. As usual, Kiski is the preliminary to the W. &.
‘AJ. ‘game. These preliminary games always prove attractive before
varsity contests. « _ _ - '.
~ TO CAMP SEPTEMBER 3 .:
A The team will go to camp at Windber the day after Labor Day, or
Tuesday, September 3., A_T_he University Engineering students -are in
camp..during the -summer and everything will be in shape for the ar-
rival of the team so that they can get down immediately‘ to hard
work. The Windber camp site‘ is ‘nowlthe property of the University
and is, therefore, a part of the campus. Hydraulic laboratoryin addi-
tion to the permanent camp equipment has been installed there, Aso
that when the team is working‘ out there, it is exactly thesame as if
- theywere working on the campus in Pittsburgh.

B. F. Boultonnwill be manager in echargeof the camp. he having
been appointed student manager under. the competitive system. His.
assistants yvill be__S. G. Wertz, 'Jr., C..F'. Wylie,’ H. H. Douthitt, S. D.
Griffith, H. M, Reed, F. E.‘Swisher, J. W. Cost, K. K. Thompson and
A. J. Anderson.‘ J. Earle Weigle, a Senior in the Medical school"next«
year, and well known Pitt distance runner of a" few years "ago, will be
first aid man. The chef will be George Kirkland, who is cooking.Aint

the Engineering camp this summer. The, camp will continue, 'accord- .“

ing to-tentativevplans until Friday, September 21, when the squad ‘will
‘return to Pittsburgh for the opening of _.school.A .
' . A NEW FIELD __A LIFE SAVER - ~ A  .
The new practice field‘ will be in good shape foi-“the accommoda-
tion ofthe team when they get down from camp. This newfield was
a great success! last year, and Pop Warner was authority for. the
statement that it had ‘much to do with the wlnning_teai'n Pitt pro-
duced. The ﬁeld is. being resown this year, and there will be. a fine
sodon it byffall. A» man._.isA_in char all shimmer looking. after it; 
as Ait was prettybadly cut u_p after last season, this specially. being
dueto the month's extra'workA in preparation for the Stanford game.

season with a defeat at the hands of
Penn State,this being its second de-
feat at the hands of our ancient rivals
this year. Although from the stand-
point of matches won and lost the
team was not ‘a. success‘ this ‘season it

ﬁrst year that the sport has-existed as
a representative, University‘ sport and
that therefore the team must not be
judged on the -basis of matches won,

gress they have made. , Looking at
the matter ‘in this light it mustbe
conqeded that the teamhas (been
quite successful in its initial objective
"of arousing an enthusiastic, interest
in the student body in favor‘ of the
game. The record of the team is as
follows: Pitt lost to Penn State both

the record for the mile from 4:39 to

pulled when Pitt“s relay team won, by

Penn Relays this year. Ryman has
scored 714 points and has a ‘ﬁghting

Herb Lytle and other fellows who are
getting in the oldtime class -now per-

Tennis has become a mighty popu-
