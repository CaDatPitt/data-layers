Delta Sigma Chi fraternity has lost
an appeal to the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) Appeal Board to
reduce or rescind ipenalities im-
posed against it by the IFC after
beer was served at an orientation
fraternity party ‘in’; June. ‘The

food supply, Pennsylvania Gover-
nor Milton Shapp spoke at the
Conference on World Hunger held
at Pitt Saturday.

Shapp said he wants to develop
programs beneﬁting US farmers,
“so that the millions of Americans

. who go hungry are taken care of.”

The World Hunger Action Coali-
tion. (WHAC) was formed by
Shapp last year which will
participate in the First United
Nations World Food Conference to
be held in Rome next month.

“At the Rome conference, parti-
cipants from 140 countries will
discuss the problems of farmers,

food production, and distribution," ~
“I am very much.

tine, no rush, no initiation, and no
pledging, but it’s the rush thing

' that’s a really severe penalty.
-,That’s the thing we mainlywanted

them to change, but they said it’s
too late.” ~

Campus Judicial Officer Alden,

Bowen, who presided at the Appeal
Board hearing agreed. “That they
were denied rush _activities- is the
strongest type of penalty, but we
decided on not overturning it

because it’s already past most of

the rushing season. Even if it
weren't so late. I doubt it would
have been changed, though,"‘he
said. ‘

Kostelnik claimed his fraternity
was being made an example of in
the Board's decision. _:v

“They admitted they were making

7 an example of us," Kostilnik said,

"1 don't think it’s fair at all."

.B'owen explained, “Any time
anybody is penalized, they’re made
an example of, but nobody singled

‘out Delta Sigma Chi. The frater-

nity‘s_ claim that there was drinking
going on at other parties ‘might be

true, but I don't feel we were

singling them out." ,
He felt theevidence was there,

“and if you don’t do it then,,why .

do it at all."
IFC Judicial

the initial IFC prosecution of- Delta
Sigma Chi, felt the action was more

. of a precedent. ‘

agreed upon by the IFC. What
Delta Sigma Chi did was damage

member fraternities by causing

adverse reactions to the whole
Greek system. .

He noted that the $200 fine would
be used exclusively to promote the
Greek System on campus.

Kostelnik felt the absence of this
year's rush might lead to a possible
extinction of Delta Sigma Chi.

“We have 25 graduating se-
niors," he said, “and we only have
18 brothers at the house. We
might lose ourhouse if we don’t fill
it up next year."

“people have known since the 207s
that the gas (sulphur dioxide) has
adverse affects on human health.

find a solution, industry has done
very little without government

“We must turn to the utilization

need to reduce ouruse of oil in
electric utility boilers and to “limit
industrial use of oil to small

Hotel Construction Plans 
 Probed by City Agency

. BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

Plans to construct an $11 million
hotel condominium complex across
Fifth Avenue from St. Paul’s
Cathedral will again be considered
by the city Planning Commission at
a public hearing scheduled for
October 15.

“I think the Commission has had
time to reflect on the proposals
merits by this time," said
developer Howard H. Christner,
whose plan was rejected by a 5-2
vote of the Commission in May.
1973. “There really are no valid
objections any more."

“The site is presently owned by
Carnegie-Mellon, and it's being
used as a parking lot, which makes
it tax—exempt. As a hotel, the area
would create revenue for the taxing
authorities. And it would improve
the esthetics of the area.”

Christner's plan calls for a
13-story hotel containing 168
two-bedroom suites and a nine-
floor condominium containing 78
apartments. According. to the
developer these structures would
create 250 new permanent jobs in
addition to the actual construction
work.

“There are all sorts of people
needed for a structure of this sort.
That includes maids. chefs. waiters
and waitresses, accounting people,
mechanical and electrical engi-
neers, and 'so on."

Christner's proposal was most
vehemently opposed by a group
from the parish of St. Paul's

Cathedral. who contended the
construction of a hotel and
condominium was an intrusion into
a high—class residential and com-
mercial area.

The developer has filed a zoning
charge application for the project

which would be adjacent to a

branch of Mellon Bank and across
the street from the Webster Hall
Hotel.

“We’ve been endorsed by Car-
negie-Mellon, Pitt, Oakland Devel-
opment (ODI); and Mellon Insti-
tute." said Christner. “St. Paul's
is really the only opposition.”

When Christner takes his propos-
al to the city Planning Commission
for the second time, he will have to
contend with Paul G. Sullivan, and
active member of St. Paul’s parish
committee, and member of the city
Planning Commission. The develo-
per admitted Sullivan will certainly

not have changed his mind.
It the hotel proposal does get the

Commission's nod, Christner will
lease the site on a long-term basis
from Carnegie-Mellon.

‘truism, indeed. As the negative

confession began to- pour out it

attempt to circumvent. the ideol-

that black people will either control
their institutions or subject them-
selves to the same paternalistic
good will and depravity which ruled
the slave plantation.

For instance, the idea of “relative
autonomy” was bent out of shape
so as to fit with the declared
sentence that “Chairmen must get

phlebitic suggestion.

\Number One called for “objective
personnel decisions,” and we
suspect we know the objects of
such decisions, those who continue
to stand up and be counted, those
who wish to maintain the integrity
of a departmental unit, those who
have no confusion about the nature
of relative autonomy but who
recognize “divide and conquer” in
every disguise which it presents
itself. '

Leller to the Editor

The events taking place over the
issue of selection of a chairperson
at the black studies department at
Pitt have made the department a
specimen for studying imperialism
as neocolonialism. .

This is more so since the entire
operation is undertaken within the‘
department itself chieﬂy by one
Vernell Lillie, a woman specialist in
psychodrama (meaning dramatiza-
tion of illusions). The rest of the
bunch who themselves brought the
faculty question on this issue to the
Pitt News consisted of the known
reactionary professors on ‘campus,-
Emmanuel Anise, - Rollo Turner,
Richard Blackett. Then there are a
few vacillants characteristic of
bourgeois or petty-bourgeois in-
tellectuals.

The game of imperialism these
characters are playing is brought
out in a brief historical accounts of
the selection process which has
stalled the dep_artment’s growth for
two years or more now. After the
defeat of Dean Rosenberg’s forces,
Anise and Co. last year, the

Department settled fora one year-

interim chairperson while at the
same time the administration was

"regrouping and reinforcing their
force within the department

through all kinds of media, and

through the establishment of a
system of quality control in
DBCERD,” and reworked it into a
threat against the faculty. As
though the Black Studies faculty
had not long ago articulated such a
need out of its curriculum
committee, prior to the time when
the chief academic ofﬁcers of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
decided- to make Black Studies their
pet project, and to condition certain
of their pets through administrative
massage. “May his rock have 34
stories, and his ‘vulture descend
with the voice of the people!” the
young man cried, and they_
laughed. not knowing the myth as
it descended. '

Number One continued to show
his relative ignorance of the black
studies department and the pro-
ductive efforts of its faculty by
calling for “a man who” could
bring‘ a‘ “clear Mission” out of
Black Studies. Of course, he reads
the wrong papers, as the depart-
ment has agreed to such a mission
during the early summer and the
September 30 BAS News has_
reprinted it for all who have eyes to
see. ‘

Something in there for everyone
except those who bastardize
themselves in collusion with the
forces which work .against depart-
mental development under the
guise of “administrative support”
and proper hierarchy.”

Initially Number One chose to
ignore the relatively productive
year in Black Studies which has
seen for the first time the
statement of “Departmental Struc-
ture," . “Departmental Mission,”
"Departmental By-laws,” “De-
partmental Criteria for Promotion
and Appointment,” the regulari-
zing of departmental professorial
ranks and salaries, and the
functional operation of _Executive
Council. \

nomination for committees and‘

councils of the University.

In the second round of the
selection of the .permanent chair-
person, therefore, Emmanuel
Anise was the ﬁrst faculty within
the department to apply for the
position._ But, this second process
involved a search committee
representing different groups
within the University and in the
wider community. Normally,
Anise's application received no

consideration by the Search-

Committee. \

The selection process ended up in
favor of Charles Mosley (a known
radical) at Chicago State University
and Curtiss Porter, the founder of
the department whose unyielding
stance toward the administration’s
intimidating maneuvers and dedi-
cation to radical education have
made the administration and their
flunkeys swear to viciously under-
-mine him and the department. It

(created a situation bourgeois
political scientists call tweedledum

and tweedledee for the administra-
tion.

When this result reached the
administration circle, they immed-
iately organized all forms of secret
information and malicious pro-
paganda system on the three most

less” year of operation [mainly .

because one so-called faction ‘holed
up in the social science building,
and only emerged after they had
again proven " insufficient to the
cause of open, democratic prac-
the Provost called for a
person who could unify the
“factions” in Black Studies.’ We
can only note that such factions
ceased to’ exist until such a ‘time
when some members of the
department, with one foot in and
one foot out, chose to publicly
dishonor themselves by printing
jealous grievances and lies about
the situation in Black Studies (Pitt
News Sept. 30(‘ after they had again
[as usual]— participated in a
democratic process and seen
themselves emerge in their own
terms “unvictorious.”

The administration apparently
uses their whines as indicators of
situations which call for the “old
one-two.”

Now, they clamor for honest
members of faculty to accept “no
decision” as decision, to eliminate
the role, process and judgement of
the Search Committee and to
succumb to the not even subtle
intimidation of Mr. One and Mr.
Two.

The_question is “Who got the
Alka Seltzer(s)”

Three out of four faculty decisions
over the past year are apparently
not enough. '

Support of “way more than ﬁve”
persons in the black community is
apparently not enough. '

Six-hundred and more petitions of
support by students are apparently
not enough.

Credentials and experience are
apparently not enough.

Recommendations by the Dean's
own Search Committee apparently
can’t take away the pain.

favored candidates [three, since
the third candidate Constance
Acholonu is more favorable to the
administration than either Mosley
or Porter] Charles Mosley,
Constance Acholonu of Seattle,
Washington and Curtiss Porter.
This system was placed under
Vernell Lillie, the psychodramatist
in the department. She, therefore,
placed under this system, her and
the Dean's choice, Roland Smith of
bourgeois history at Carnegie-
Mellon University.

The secret information system’

. generated all kinds of rumors and

malicious propaganda that nec-
essitated a reevaluation of the
candidates. ‘In this reevaluation
process based on this Vernell
Lillie’s secret information, Charles
Mosley did not receive any other
support or recommendation. It
came out that Curtiss Porter was
‘the most" favored among all
constituencies "involved including
the Search Committee, itself.
Constance Acholonu received the
‘second widest support. Still
Roland Smith -did not receive
considerable support among these
constituencies incliiding the faculty
of the department.

This outcome was officially
submitted to Dean Rosenberg by
the chairman of the Search
Committee, Norman Johnson, a
dean at Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity. This communication ended in
these sentences: “As a final
statement if would be unfair to be
neutral on the matter of choice. It
is my judgment and I believe our
judgment that the preference
candidate of the Search Com-
mittee, of the students, and of the
Black Studies faculty is Curtiss E.
Porter. For "me personally -1 would

hope that you would give” this

preference highest consideration as
you now- must select from the
names submitted.”

Again, the secret information
system was whipped up culmin-
ating in the withdrawal of
Constance Acholonu from candi-‘
dacy. The system having back-
fired, it became obvious to

announce Curtiss Porter as ,_the _

chairperson of the department.

But, in keeping with the truth
Mao Tse-tung told us that
reactionaries, will make trouble,
fail, make trouble again, fail again
and so on; the administration
forces within the department are
now bringing Dean Rosenberg and
Provost Rhoten Smith to faculty
meetings to intimidate, deceive,
cajole, and entice the members of
the faculty into submitting to any
preconceived procedure to install
Roland Smith as the chairperson of
the department or else, the
department will not only be without
a chairperson but should expect
administrative repercussions.

At this point, the responsible
peace-loving students and staff at
the University should speak out.
The rank and ﬁle in unions should
ask the Deans and the Provost to
carry out the people’s will —or else‘
be removed from ofﬁce.

‘Bourgeois debunking in school
newspapers by reactionary forces
even against the black student
body for speaking out must stop.
The reactionaries must be told their

drama is full of psycho. We see not ‘i

only form but both form and
content since the masses have
always to deal with concrete
realities--not illusions.

Look at the Black Experience at Pitt

   
   
    
 
 
  
   
   
  
    
  
 
   
 
   

BY TOM WASELE/SKI
,~ f._Under militant beginnings black
‘student movements sprang up on
virtually every college campus in
the United States, seeking national
‘recognition of the problems facing
not only black students but also
black society at large. Pitt’s Black
Action Society and Black Studies
Department proved to be no
exception in the late 1960’s. But an
evaluation of today's Pitt black
movement still depends on who you

',-“The Black Studies Department
slgould be the most important
department at the University for all
students, black or white,” said
.Graylyn Swﬂley, chairperson of
7_-Pitt’s Black Action Society,
“because it can focus‘ in on
-_s4_ociety’s chief problem, racism.

“lnthis society blacks and whites
are oriented not to deal with each
other. '

“We must recognize and acknow-
ledge each other. We come from
different homes and different
economic levels, but we share the
same food, the same movies, the
same music. We’re all part of a
general culture.

Swilley believes realization of an
integrated black-white culture can
result from more white students
taking black studies courses. She
said it should be a requirement for
everyone if we are to remedy the.
racial situation.

Calvin Branch of the black
fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha said he
has faced no racism as an
individual. i
. “But as a group blacks face a lot

of trouble,” he added, “because of
the general attitude that people
have concerning the stigma of
inferiority.”

Swilley felt society is interrelated,
“but things like racism divide us.
For instance, ‘busing is seen as a
black and white issue,‘when really
it is a problem affecting children.”

The Pitt Black Action Society
seeks to strip away racial prejudice
from current issues and solve the
problems from a purely social
standpoint.

Swilley said the goal of the Black
Action Society is in heightening the
consciousness of all students so
that they may understand each
other better.

She explained the black move-

ment at Pitt is still seeking to be

recognized as a particular entity,
and blacks must realize that their
particular needs are not charac-
teristic of the needs of society as a
whole.

“Only you yourself can, best see
what you need,” said Swilley,
“and that's why the BAS is here.”
The blacks on « campus, she
emphasized,- do not mean to

segregate themselves from the

mainstream of the University, but
wish to assert their culture in the
same way that other societies
assert theirs, ‘ ‘ V

Cultural existence demands a
means for expression, and just as
Pitt as Greek organizations that are
predominantly white, so, too, are‘
there black fraternities and soror-
ities. ,

Sheryl Johnson, president of the
black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha,
feels a harmonious integration of

the black and white cultures is»

“only an ideal."

“Take an Alaskan and set him in a
society of- South Americans. ‘He
won’t be able to relate.”

She asserted blacks can more
easily relate to each other, and they
are “moving further away from the
white culture in the . process of
identification." « '

Barbara Sweeney of the BAS
News believes blacks and whites

are “more separate than ever."

“Both groups are happy with the
way it is,” she reflected, adding
that the separation may be
permanent. “If people didn’t want
to be separate they would try to get
into each other’s groups. lt’s all up
to what the people want.” _

Barbara Fair of Zeta Phi Beta said
her sorority gives Greek-minded
blacks a sense of unification. She
believes there is “more enthusiasm
in black fraternities and sororities"
than in their white counterparts.

According to Sheryl Johnson,
“black Greeks work more in the
community‘ than white Greeks,"
citing continuing efforts in Pitts-
burgh's poverty-stricken Hill D_is-
trict.

Although no white students are
official members of the BAS,
Swilley said, whites work with the
organization. For the first time,
according to Swilley, the BAS is
working with other student organi-
zations, citing a joining of forces
with Pitt’s Student Government
over the Student Union Annex
problem. “Were all affected,”
Swilley’ said. V

The problems at times seem
insurmountable. Black Studies has
no chairman presently in one of the
hottest issues to hit Pitt in recent
years. Only one of the seven Black
Greek groups has its own house.
And general racial bias always
exists for individualsto contend
with. I

Emmanuel Anise of the Black
Studies department revealed many
black studies programs were being
cut in direct response to the
sagging economy. ’

“Nowadays the tendency of
institutions is to begin to cut back
on promises made in better times,”
noted Anise. He also said there is a
significant decline in scholarships
offered to poor minorities under the
UCEP program.

Anise believes a well-rounded
Black Studies program is necessary
if black students are to learn how to
survive in a white society.

problems. They have the basic
distrust that ‘you won’t care, you
won’t listen.’ ” He traced white
society's attitude to “insensitivities.
to the needs of blacks rather than’
an exhibition of racism.”

Anise described the present day

camp. He said some black students
believe they must maintain their
identity to get a greater sense of
participation and self-respect. But
he added that many are not keen on
maintaining black groups. “No
one‘ knows‘ what is really going
on."- .
' What is really going on, in
Graylyn Swilley‘s estimation, is a
lot of rejuvenation in the Pitt black
movement: “Everything’s going to
be expanded but we can’t grow
without students. We've asked the
students to respond, and they’ve
been responding."

Reflecting on the beginnings of
the black movement as a defensive
group, Swilley pointed out that
blacks can now go on tobuild.

“We are in an awakening time, a
harmonious time, a unifying and a
liberating time,". she proclaimed
and added emphatically, “for all
people."

“Disaster" Flicks to Hit Pg

BY M. C. PILECKI

What ever happeneduto movies?
It seemed that once upon a time,
not so very long ago, Pittsburgh
was one of the prime markets for
new ﬂicks, often opening here soon
after or simultaneously with New
York and Los Angeles premieres.
No more. Somehow, Pittsburgh has
been sinking lower on the totem
pole [no ethnicity intended] so that
we may not even hear about the
new films for months, and in the

case of foreign films, for years.
Among the city's l4 first-run
theatres were two “art houses,"
showcases for good, low-mass
appeal ﬁlms, both foreign and

' ‘domestic. Now, the Guild is mainly

a revival house and is lucky to see
two new-to-Pittsburgh ﬁlms a year,
and the Shadyside _ has been
vacillating between rock movies

 and soft porno since the spring.

As for the other houses, the
_Fulton-Mini has stuck to soft porno
and occasional revivals of still fairly
new films. The Manor seems to
have become mainly a second-run,
“neighborhood” type theatre, and
the -Squirrel Hill, at least as
evidenced’ by its last three

bookings, has become a wastecan

fortrashy, exploitative moviesithat
have substituted for art.

Of those first-runners left, now
dwindled to eight, several have
been stuck in the revival turnstile
of the past month, bringing back
the old sure-fire box office numbers
instead of bringing in the new

. product.

So what's happened to the fertile
field that used to be the Pittsburgh

, market?

It's too easy to blame the whole

. thing on the Cinemette monopoly

of local theatres, although their
policy of showing less films at more
houses for a short time, instead of
providing a continuous variety , is
one that has been _irking local
movie-lovers for quite a while. Part

’ of the problem goes back to basic

economics: you can't survive by
showing films that won't bring in
the box office dollar. That's the
prime lesson learned by the old art
houses, who would lament over
empty houses for f1r'st—rate ﬁlms,
yet pack ‘em in for some shoddier
commercial work.

It’s a sad time for movie lovers,
not only because of the delay of
new flicks coming into town, but
also because the ones that are
getting here arelno great prize,
either. This is the year of The Great
Disaster Film [pun fully intended],
the multi-star epics short on plot
and character, featuring a band of
high-priced stereotypes reacting to

, some grandiose, multi-million dol-

I

lar man-made disaster, banking on
the success of Airport and
Poseidon Adventure.

Wow. Just about ready to open
here is the Airport II, also known as
Son of Airport, the sequel to that
last great bomb. Juggernaut is in
town, too, a‘ more watery story.

I And yet to come is The Towering

lnfemo, the same story in ‘a
burning. skyscraper, and Earth-
quake, same line, this tirite with
Los Angel_es or something crumbl-

I

ing. If you dig looking at stars
making fools of their careers and
are interested in special effects,
then you may like this stuff.
Otherwise...

There isione new non-disaster
ﬂick in town, but Harry and Tonto
is no great winner either. The

‘problem is, again, the view of

director Paul Mazursky, better
known for Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice and, more recently,
Blume in Love. He has a
parochially narrow view of society
based on the rather warped life of
upper middle class liberal Southern
Californ_ians, who lose all sense of
propriety in an “I’l1 try anything"
mode of tolerance.

Harry and Tonto starts out well,
light a tightly wound ball of string,
which, ‘as the movie ‘progresses.
become rapidly unwound and ends
up a tangled mess. It starts out
well, with Harry [Art Carney in his
best role] as an elderly man living
in a rundown New York neighbor-
hood, peopled with a plethora of
colors, nationalities and accents.
He gets along very well, living
much of his time in the past and
talking to his cat, Tonto.

The movie is quite interesting as it
stays in the East, painting some
rather delicate portraits of the
different characters: Harry, his old
best friend, and a troubled son and
his wife, who want to do their filial
duty in taking in Harry after he's

evicted, but are faced with a clash .,
of personalities. Harry seeks his‘
‘own independence, and travels off

to Chicago, picking up a hitchhiker
and meeting an old memory along
the way. Up to this point, the odd
situations that Harry faces are
brought in quite naturally and
unaffectedly, but then the movie
really disintegrates.

Ellen Burstyn gets in a short part
as Harry's daughter, but, like all
the characters, she has little

efmition. Harry, who begins the '

movie as a dignified old gent, very
much “aware” and part of the
“Real people" scene, ends up as
an old fool, who has been duped
and strung along by many of the
characters late in. the movie,
although you won't really pick that
up at first glance. He's quite a
pitiable object at the movie's end
when one remembers, his earlier,
stronger character, but it's a point
that has totally escaped Mazursky.

The filmsuffers badly from its
choppy, vignette presentation.
-Several interesting episodes, par-
ticularly at the beginning of the
flick, do crop up, but none are
allowed to develop. Mazursky, as

usual, takes a rather simplistic look’

at his characters, never entering
into the world of motivation behind
some rather odd behavior.

But it has its moments: Harry
being carried bodily from his New
York home, the look on his face
when he spots a cat just like his
Tonto, the meeting with an old
sweetheart, not too senile to

remember (him. But ‘it's ,_a-ll._too.«¥

 

O
shallow. There's too much
crammed into one movie, and most
of it doesn't fit.

At least for the moment, the good
ﬂicks are the old ﬂicks. For the
brave of heart, there's a movie
marathon October 8 and 9 at the
Squirrel Hill Theatre for the
Pittsburgh Press Old Newsboys,’
Fund for Children's Hospital. Ten
movies will be shown, from
midnight, October 8 "to -8:30 pm
October 9, and most of them are
real goodies: It Happened One
Night (1934); Mr. Deeds'Goes to
Town (1936); Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington (1939); His Girl Friday
(1940); From Here to Eternity
(1953); On the Waterfront (1954);
The Bridge on the River Kwai

( 195 7); Dr. Strangelove (1964); The ,

Professionals (1966) and Funny
Girl (1968). Most are Academy
Award winners, and some are real
classics. Oh yes, admission is $1,
and the theatre will provide the
coffee.

Artist Berman Presents

Abstract Pieces at Showing 

BY JAN LLOYD
The art of Becky Berman is
presently on exhibit in a one-per-
son show being held at the Pitt's

-UP Gallery. In Berman's words,

“My work is highly abstract and
very objective. What it means to
me it certainly won't mean to
others."

The exhibit features 25 of
Berman’s works, 15 oils and 10
graphics. The pieces, all abstract in
nature, are termed ﬁgure field
works. “I am very much involved
with unoccupied space.” says
Berman. ‘

Her canvases frequently exhibit
angular forms of dark and bright
color, positioned in space. Bold

blues and bright orange-reds are ,

found‘ as. a, reoccurring color
scheme. Her forms appear as
blocks of color in many of her

,canvases. Such examples are the -

' oils “Dance 1" and “Dance II."

Major's Werst Defeat Ar Pin

3“

BY BART MACK
Sports Editor

CHAPEL HILL, NC‘--Literally un-
stable. the North Carolina Tarheels
offensive machine amassed 552
yards enroute to a 45-29 over Pitt
Saturday, handing Johnny Majors
his worst defeat since taking
charge of the Panthers.

In fact, the only time the Tarheels
offense did not put points on the
board was when they stopped
themselves.- The Panthers defense
did not force NC into a single

punting situation and the Tarheels
stalled but twice in Pitt territory,
missing a pair of field goal
attempts.

Owls Edge Boaters, 3-2  

BY ANDY BEHREND V

For -a few brief, beautiful mo-

__ merits Saturday morning in Phila-

delphia, it was a scene reminiscent

of the Boston Red Sox in 1967, a

cloddy Jerry Lewis wooing and

winning Jill St. John, Truman over
Dewey.

Hundred to one shots all, Pitt’s
soccer team nearly etched‘ their
way into the club of victorious
underdogs, only to be snuffed out
at the end by irrepressible Temple,

- 3-2. . ~
The Owls, ranked 19th in the
country to the clash, were out-
hustled by the hungrier Panthers
early in the contest. '
With but three minutes gone,
John Curley caught the Temple
defense in error. He intercepted a
pass back from anlOwl fullback to
netminder Woody Hartman. The

Englishman deked around another
defender’ and popped the ball
behind a startled Hartman for the
game’s initial score.

Only 15 minutes later Pitt tallied

again. Curley took the ball deep 9

into owl territory and squibbed a
kick which fortunately found its
way to right wing Bill Rex. For the
second time Hartman was out of
position, and Rex beat him easily.

That margin was cut in half less
than -a minute later, when Owl
freshmen Bill Sautter picked up a
loose ball and dribbled it straight
into the Panther net.

Sautter’s goal switched the mo-
mentum of the game. The Owl
front line played more aggressively

and kept the ball in the Pitt end for -

several minutes. The drive was
terminated. by a well placed header
past Pitt netminder Frank Bucci by

Potomic State, 14-0

BY STEVE SYBERT

Combining a strong running
attack and a stingy defense, the

Pitt Panther Jayvees rolled to a
14-0 victory over Potomac State at

L"t‘;Pitt Stadium on Friday.

' Halfback Willie Taylor, who raced
for 104 yards in 25 carries,
accounted for the two Pitt
touchdowns with bursts of 13 and 5
yards. ‘.

The Panthers, led the Catamounts
in‘ all offensive -categories.

Fiﬁ ,

racked up 209 yards on the ground
to Potomac’s 56 and also led in
passing yardage, 91-64 and ﬁrst
downs, 12-7.

The tough Pitt defense caused and
recovered two Potomac fumbles,
Paul Test and Ed Ford falling on
the loose, footballs. Gary Tyra and
Steve'Pritchard also turned in fine
defensive efforts for the Panthers.

Pitt’s first score came with 12:47

The 2-2 deadlock (four goals
scored in 20 minutes is not a
defensive ballgame), settled down
in to a patterned tussle, with each
team creating its own’ chances.
Pitt’s much maligned offense put
the Philadelphia’s defense to _the
test a few times, but could not
score.

Temple scored their winning goal
with 10 minutes left to play in the
first half. Sautter received a long
pass, catching the Panther defense
out of position. He drilled a shot
from 20 yards out, and the scoring
for the day was over. ,

The second half was controlled for
the most part by the Owls, now 4-0.
Their superior ball skills befuddled
Pitt in many instances, but they
could not score an insurance goal.

Coach Leo Bemis was pleased

_ with his team’s third strong con-

secutive effort. , V ‘

“We really executed quite well
offensively, and our halfback play
was the best we’ve had this year.
We felt throughout the game that
we were as good as them. If we
had to lose, that’s the wayto do

The game, though soothing balm
mentally, left several of the Pan-
thers battered. John Wallace
severely bruised his collarbone

when he was nailed by Owl goalie »

Hartman, coming out to make a
save. Rex and Curley both were
kicked in the legs, and had to
receive medical attention in Pitts-
burgh.

Now 2-3-1, Pitt has a week to
prepare for Slippery Rock.

who reﬂected on the slim hopes of

Tarheels Bust Holes

In Panther Defense

’ i(iC'o21ti/111011 from Page 9)

“We knew that Pitt would have a
big, physical defensive front,”
Huff said, “but it was really to our
advantage that they stood there
and tried to wrestle us on the rush
because our backs are so quick they

can just pick the hole.”

“My main assignment was on
number 59 (linebacker Arnie
Weatheringtori) but sometimes I'd
be kicking out the insides on Pitt's
middle guard. Gary Burley," Huff
continued. “We had no plans to
double team Burley, or anyone else
because we saw in the films that he
likes to stunt to his left. He did and
all he was really doing was taking
himself out of the play."

Pitt got its first score after
winning the toss and taking the
opening kickoff for an 83 yard
march in 14 plays. Dorsett, who
sprained his ankle in the first series
of plays but returned to the lineup,
carried the ball over from the
Carolina three.

' North Carolina came right back,

grinding out yardage to the Pitt 43,
where Kupec unloaded the bomb to
Jimmy Jerome. Running a ﬂy
pattern down the center of the
field, Jerome drew coverage from
David Spates and Glenn Hodge.
Both Pitt defenders were converg-
ing on him from opposite sides, but
Jerome ﬂashed by them and took
the pass in stride with a ten yard
lead. , '
The Panthers were forced to kick

- deep in their own territory after

failing to move the ball. but punter

naugh to Taylor who sprinted 13
yards down the left sideline,
capping a Panther drive from their
own 16. '

The big play in the drive was a
39-yard pass from Cavanaugh to
Willie Marsh. The two-point
conversion try was unsuccessful.

Following Ford’s fumble’ recovery
at the Potomac .14 yard line, it was
Taylor, once again taking a
Cavanaugh pitch, going ﬁve yards
for a touchdown with 1:44
remaining in the first half. This
time -the conversion attempt was
good as _Cavanaugh found Calvin
Glover free in the end zone for the
two points. i

The Panthers took the opening .i

kick-off and marched 88 yards to
the Potomac one yard line where
the Catamount defense stiffened.
Pitt’s unsuccessful drive consumed
about 10 minutes on the clock.

Potomac‘s only serious threat
came in the waning niimites of the
fourth quarter. The Cats advanced
from their own 34 to the Panther
nine ‘yard line where the drive
stalled as Potomac failed on a
fourth and seven play. Pitt took
possession of the ball and ran out

two yard line. Tailback Jim
Bettcrson took the ball in fiomtlie
one and the Tarheels led, 14-7.

Haygood set up the next Pitt score
with a 49 yard return of the
following kickoff. but it was Daniels
carrying the ball around the left
end on the option, cutting back
inside and romping untouched for a
48 yard score.

Pitt’s last touchdown came on a
sensational 80 yard burst by fresh-
man tailback Elliot Walker in the
closing minute of the" game.
Ironically, Walker almost did not
make the trip,‘ having been both-
ered for the past two weeks with a
bad hamstring pull.

Odds & Ends--Dorsett's 59 yards
put him at 2,030 for his career,
making him Pitt's first two thou-
sand yard rusher. Dorsett was on
crutches after the game and was
scheduled for x-rays...the injury
list is long and deep,,with some key
members of the defensive unit
wearing casts. Defensive tackle

Don Parrish will probably miss this-_ --\_

week's practice sessions and is
already doubtful for the West

‘Virginia game...Bill Vitalie and Al

Romano are also sporting casts...
Daniels was 9-13 passing and 111
yards with one interception and one
touchdown...The Tarheels did not
turn the ball over 0nce...Gary
Burley was adamant after the game
about the way the officials were
calling personal fouls on Pitt’ and
himself. Several of the Carolina
drives were sustained by 15 yard

Soccer teams at Penn State,
Temple, West Virginia, and Buck-
nell boast players from Nigeria,
Peru, West Africa, Brazil, but
Pitt’s accidental answer to the
foreign soccer player is John
Curley.

Curley was born in Surrey,
England, and moi i ’ to the United
States six years ago. He came to
Pittsburgh with his family, and
graduated from Kiski Area High
School. It’s sort of ironic, also, that

I Kiski Area did not have a soccer
team.

“They just didn't have a soccer

program when I went there,”'

Curley remarked. “I played soccer
all my life in England, and that’s
how I acquired the skills that I
havef’

A great deal of skill helps support
Curley’s slender frame. He’s only
5’7” weighs 135 pounds, and plays

a game of finesse and skill rather
than a physical one. Curley’s style
of play relies on him being in
shape, and he is quick to commend
the person who has helped him in
this part of his game.

“Joe Luxbacher, our assistant
coach, has really helped us in
getting into shape,” Curley said.
“He’s playing in the pros, and he’s
brought in a lot of things that have
really contributed.”

AlthoughtCurley and the rest of
the team are in good condition this
year, they have had other
problems. V

“The most disturbing thing about
the team so far is that we have a lot
of talent, but we’re behind
schedule in getting things togeth-
er,” Curley noted.

When they lose because the team
couldn’t “get it together,” Cur-
ley’s reaction is customary for an
athlete. “I’m very irritated when

ocmi3é;i,sc1i9i   I 1

urley: Pitt’s “Foreign” Soccer Player,

we lose. But then we try and find
out what we did wrong and try to
improve. But winning is the most
important thing. ‘It’s hard to have
fun when you lose.”

Winning is important to John, but
what about publicity and lack of
student support for the soccer
team. Soccer remains substantially
below football in terms of student
support, but Curley isn’t bitter.

“You can’t knock football, be-
cause it’s the number one sport.
Although I can forsee the day when
soccer is as big as football in the
United States, I don’t think that it
will ever be bigger. Let’s face it,
football is bringing a name to Pitt."

John Curley, as the above remark
so clearly reveals, is a realist. He
rarely views a -situation with
despair, but rather with hope.
Curley remains optimistic about
the future of Pitt soccer.
