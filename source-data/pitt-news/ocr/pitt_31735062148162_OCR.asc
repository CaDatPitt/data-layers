Mr. Corley’s statement as Tony, ton-

sorial expert of Hotel Schenley, clipped the first auburn hairs with his

chrome clipper before an estimated?

gathering of 20 spectators assembled
in the dean of men’s ofﬁce.

I For the beneﬁt of newspaper cam-
eramen, Edward B. Williams, the
winner of the contest among the as-
sistants to the dean of men, removed
his coat, took up Tony’s razor, and
poised it over the remaining half of
the mustache.

No expert at wielding the barber’s
blade, Mr, Williams decided not to
continue and relinquished the razor
to its owner who ﬁnished the opera;
tion in approximately seven minutes.

While the ordeal was being com-
pleted, a call was received for Mr.
Corley, but the caller was told by

J. G. Quick, University registrar,
who was the caller, said that he ex-
pected Mr. Corley to lisp, if he was
able to call back at all.

“I wanted to get rid of it anyhow,”
the loser stated as he surveyed the
remains of his face in the mirror soon
after the mustache was completely
removed.

There was also another loser in the
three-man contest. This was Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men, who staunchly refused to grow
a decoration on his upper lip. Said
he: “I am under no moral obligation

to grow a mustache, and I don’t plan
to.”

Alumni Launch
New Campaign

For Members

Miller Cites Importance

5 Of Decided Increase

In 0rganization’s Roll

With a meeting of a hundred work-
ers in Stephen Foster Memorial, the
University Alumni Association
launched its annual membershjp
drive last Tuesday evening.

Culminating from several weeks’

preparation, the meeting formally
organized the proposals that have
been made by alumni during the past
few months. I-Iarbaugh Miller, ’25,
first vice president of the association,
is general chairman of the member-
ship campaign.
, Paralleling the sentiments express-
ed by John B. Nicklas, alumni presi-
dent, Mr. Miller explained that: “This
is our most important membership
drive. Alumni everywhere are in-
sisting that we make ourselves self-
supporting and not dependent upon
the usual appropriation from the
University.

“We can do this only if alumni join
the association. If they do, we can
have a strong, active and thoroughly
independent organization, which will
be a real inﬂuence in the affairs of
the University. Only by having a
large membership can we exercise
our right to nominate 13 members to
the Board of Trustees next spring.” '

eral committee are Jean Hay, ’33;
Eric Johnson, ’23; John Collins, ’19;
Dr. Harry Metz, ’15; and Virginia
Griffith, ’30, alumnae membership
_chairman. The chairman for various
constituent groups are: Business Ad-
ministration, Howard Schwartz, ’24;
College, Dr. Kendall Tesh, ’l8;
Dentistry, Dr. Dewitt Hall, ’l7; Edu-
cation, Herman Ziel, ’36; Medicine,
Dr. Norman Oehsenhirt, ’l7; and
Pharmacy, Harry Ostrow, ’29.

Panthers to Receive
Students’ Telegrams

  

Telegrams, harbingers of death, de-
struction and love, will be used for
quite a different purpose today, if
a planned program of well-wishing
goes through.

The University’s football team will
be bombarded by an onslaught of
“good luck” telegrams.

Fraternities, activity groups, and
other campus organizations will send
telegrams to the team in New York
as an expression of conﬁdence and
“We’re all behind you, so get in
there and-FIGHT!” wishes for their
game tomorrow with Fordham. This
procedure was advanced on the sug-
gestion of William Kelly, C42.

Individual students would aid the
plan,‘ Kelly explained, by sending
telegrams to particular members of
the team. (Co-eds, there’s your
chance!) To be most effective, the
messages should be in New York
sometime today.

All telegrams should be sent to the
Croydon hotel, New York city. Tele-
grams to individuals as well as to the

entire team should be sent in care of
Robert Frost, varsity manager.

Mr. Miller’s assistants on the gen-

riots of last V
lhiqucsne ,c::1n1c, Charles 'i‘rapp,
”4.-0, presulent of (]‘z11“1’1cgi<% Tech
Student t‘ou11ci]_. and others of
that school’s governing bodies, met
at the invitation of Patrick Cusick,
CE40, with University representa-
tives in the College Club for a din-
ner meeting.

Emphasizing the seriousness of
Monday's riots, in which John
Hobbs, C42, had his back broken,
Cusick asked the assembled group to
make plans that such a thing not
occur after the Carnegie Tech game,
and that steps be taken to prevent

Will the University students who
have the Tech goalposts please re-
turn them to Carnegie Tech, or
leave word in the dean of men’s
office or with Pat Cusick, as to
where they may be found and SFA
will assume responsibility for re-
turning them. Their return has
been pledged in order that the
trophy award may be started.

any more pre-game “incidents” that
damaged school and private prop-
erty. The most recent of such in-
cidents include the stealing of the
goalposts from Tech, and the paint-
ing of the Cathedral walks.

After a pledge by the UniV€l‘SitY
representatives that the goal posts
would be returned to Tech, both
schools agreed that the posts should
be awarded yearly to the school that
won the annual Pitt-Tech game.
Complete cooperation was assured
the Tartan representatives in seeing
that the trophy would be returned
by Saturday.

In the general discussion, it was
agreed that the team that won would
parade with its supporters to the
other school, there to be presented
with the trophy. The presentation
would be preferably made between
the team captains. This ceremony
was to occur the Monday following
the game at a time to be determined
according to the occasion.

Pointing to the sportsmanship that
had characterized last year’s game,
especially when the University’s band
had prevented any riot by playing
the Tech victory song o-n the field
after the game, and to Carnegie’s
reciprocation by singing “Hail to
Pitt” at their assembly, the group
hoped that the new award and policy
would help to continue such a spirit.

In a statement to the News the
University group also felt that the
good sportsmanship of those who
now have the goalposts would prompt
them to return them immediately.

A statement of policy endorsed
by both groups was drawn up. It
was: »

1. The winning team shall re-
ceive or retain the Pitt-Tech goal-
posts from the 'representa.tive of
the losing team at a. time suitable
to both groups on the Monday fol-
lowing the game.

2. The game is played on the
field. It should not be carried on

Regulatibns End

Today is the day. October 27,
marking the end of customs enforce-
ment, ﬁnds freshman women with all
the rights and privileges of upper-
classwomen: no more arms bands, no
more entering the Cathedral by the
lower doors.

It means also no more mixer-
dances, however, and no more openly
appreciative glances from upperclass-
men.

Starting with the green arm band
ceremony during freshmen week, the
customs committee of WSGA, under’
the direction of Gene Pyle, C41, has
conducted a thorough plan to make
the women feel they are really a part
of the University.

The High Tea, Lantern Night, and
the Customs Brunch last Saturday
have been highlights in the life o_t'
the freshman women.

Although today marks the remov-
al of arm bands, the work of the cus-
toms committee is not ﬁnished. On
Monday, November 20, the Merit
Panther assembly under the direc-
tion of Pearl Hilsenrath, C41, will
honor freshman women Nvho have
maintained at least a 1.00 average,
passed. -their customs examination,
and have displayed the University
spirit. ‘ ’

lmxve failed to score a meagre point but the same can be said of the

New Yorkers.

Tomorrow’s game is listed as a9

consolation affair since both teams
have tasted defeat this season, Ford-
ham coming out on the short end in
games with Alabama and Tulane.
Guess who beat Pitt!
Rams Seek Revenge

Fordham will be seeking revenge
for the 24-13 lacing suffered at the
hands of Goldberg and the “dream
backﬁeld” in Pitt’s back yard last
year. i

To date the Rams have won but
one game, the opening tussle of the
season against the Waynesburg Yel-
lowjackets. This was followed by
two consecutive defeats and a layoff
last Saturday.

Injuries have riddled the Fordham
eleven, but two weeks rest ﬁnd Coach
Crowley’s boys in tip-top condition.
Lou DeFilippo, ﬁrst string center, is
still nursing injuries, and Jim Hag-
gerty will start the game at the pivot
position.

Fordham’s starting lineup has Vic
Dennery and Ray Riddick at the
terminals, John Kuzman and Joe
Ungerer holding up at tackles, and
Tom Bennett and Larry Sartori
ﬂanking I-Iaggerty at the guard posi-
tions.

Soph Star Starts

The backﬁeld‘ for the Rose (Hill
crew ﬁnds Jimmy Noble at the signal
barking post, Jimmy Blumenstock
spear-heads the attack from the left
halfback slot, Pete Holovak provides
the blocking from his right halfback
spot, and Dom Principe does the line
bucking.

Len Eshmont, sophomore star of
last year, is being held in reserve as
is Steve Kazlo, brilliant blocking back
of the past two years.

The Rams are having blocking
trouble this year. In three games,

they have been able to gain but 478
yards through rushing against 672
yards gained by the Panthers in four
games. However, the Rams have an
average of 4.1 yards per rush and
the Panthers 3.9.

Pitt has had practice against the
type of offense the Rose Hill eleven
will throw at them tomorrow. Du-
quesne also is styled in the Notre
Dame offense.

Pitt’s starting lineup will be the
same as opened the season in Seattle
with Ted Konetsky returning to his
tackle position. Coach Bowser states
that the team morale is high in spite
of their defeat of last week, and the
boys are out to get back in the win
column. .

F1-osh Gridders
Face Stiff Foe
At W. Virginia

Pitt’s freshman gridders face the
West Virginia Little Mountaineers in
their second battle of the current sea-
son at Morgantown, West Virginia,
tomorrow afternoon.

The starting line-up for tomorrow’s
fray is highly doubtful. Injuries have
riddled the squad, making the selec-
tion of starters a difﬁcult task.

Coaches Walt Raskowski and Chuck
Shea will probably put a different
line-up on the ﬁeld than that which
faced the Penn State Lions two weeks
ago. The ends will probably be se-
lected from among Joe Adamchic,
Bill Lohmeyer, Tex I-Iinte, and Larry
Klotz.

Tackle Uncertain

Mario Martorelli and Jimmy Anto-
nelli were the guards in the State
game and will undoubtedly see ac-
tion tomorrow. Johnny Gurczenski
will be at one tackle, but the other
tackle is a mystery. At the snapper-
back spot will be either Bob Schmidt
or Jack Heister, if the spike wound
in the latter’s hand permits him to
play.

A knee injury to regular right half-
back Marty Vardaro has upset back-
ﬁeld plans. Vardaro will see little or
no action tomorrow. Walt Wasco-
vich will call the signaals at quarter-
back, and Bob l\/Ialloy will do most
of the kicking from the fullback po-
sition.

The halfback posts are undecided
but Vince Anania, Jack Stetler, and
Gene Gascalli should appear in the
game.

Leave in Morning

The yearling team will leave the
stadium at eight o’clock tomorrow
morning. After playing the I30W€1".

aineer Field in the afternoon the
squad will return late tomorrow

Coach Shea and three student man-
agers will accompany the team on

The Mountaineer Cubs present a
talented array of frosh grid stars,
having shellacked the Tech Plebes
in their ﬁrst encounter, 39-0. Two
ﬂeet half-backs, former West Virginia
school boy pigskin headliners, carry‘

the PiKA’s for small gains. The
backﬁeld also picked up only for a
short time as the PiKA forward wall,
sparked by Bill Barrett and Page,
proved a little too much.

In a game marred by rain as well
as dull football, the Phi Ep coasted

‘B’ Eleven Today

Twenty-two Pitt “B” gridders
shoved oﬁ yesterday for Annapolis

where they will meet the Navy “B’s”l

this afternoon.

A very sketchy starting line-up
would cast Stahl aand Pressell at
ends, Cambal and Franchini at tack-
les, Rabinek a possible guard, Alls-
house at center, and Tom Murphy
the only sure starting back. Walt
Fridley likely won’t see any action
because of an early season knee in-
jury.

After today’s game the boys will
bed down at Annapolis, then hop out
at 6:30 o'clock tomorrow morning to
entrain for New York and .a glimpse
of the Pitt-Fordham contest.

Making the trip are John Stah1,~ ;

Earl Pressell, George Allshouse, Wil-
liam Frick, Melvin Andrews, Fred
Noah, Ray Rabinek, Walt Fridley,
John Ross, Joe Cambal, Bud Kincaid,
Robert Stodgell, Albert Kunkel, A1-

and Eddie Murphy.

Three men who may have gone to
Fordham are Bill Benghouser, Billy

panied the squad.

 Harriers in Win at West Point

By Ben Foote

Led by Captain Zeke Sterner, who
is rapidly establishing himself as a
leading candidate for the ICAAAA
individual cross country champion-
ship late in November, Coach Carl
Olson's harriers soundly trounced
the Army squad, 18-37, Wednesday
over the scenic layout at West Point.

Captain Zeke led his teammate A1
Boulanger, another ICAAAA con-
tender, across the ﬁnish line of the
three and three-quarter mile course
by 14 seconds, Sterner was clocked
in 19 minutes, 43 seconds.

Boulanger put on one of his blis-
tering ﬁnishes to edge De Latour,
first cadet to ﬁnish, by three seconds.
De Latour, the ace of the West
Point troupe, stopped the watch at
exactly 20 minutes.

First Billing of Season
To Star Cooper, Tone
In Story of ‘Lancers’

Starting its second active year on
campus, the Essefay Theater will
show “Lives of a Bengal Lancer”
next Thursday, in 24 Cathedral, ac-
cording to David Tucker, C41, chair-
man of the project.

Founded to give the student body
this type of free entertainment, the
project has arranged a complete pro-
gram of popular moving pictures to
run every Thursday until the middle
of April.

The first picture features Gary
Cooper, Franchot Tone, Richard
Cromwell, and the late Sir Guy
Standing, and was one of the most
popular pictures of the past ten years.
Military life on the border between
India and Afghanistan is depicted in
the movie.

According to Patrick Cusick, E40,
president of SFA, the committee was
appointed “to carry on the ﬁne work
of last year’s committee by giving
the student more of the entertain-
ment which he seems to enjoy. That
is, to contract for more and better
pictures for showing during the year.”

Other committee members are:
William L. Klinkenstein, C42; Frank
Mateer, C41; William Morton, C41;
Jack Stauﬁ‘, C42; Andrew Piergeorge,
C41; Howard Lazear, C41: Sara Pitt-
ler, C41, and James Hughes, C42.
Faculty adviser is Theodore W. Bid-
dle, assistant dean of men.
