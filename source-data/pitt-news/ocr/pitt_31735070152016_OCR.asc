For The Pitt News

David Bartholomae was in Beijing, Chi-
na, when he learned that Pitt wanted to
nominate him as Pennsylvania’s profes-
sor of the year.

While leading students on a study
abroad program last spring, Bartholo-
mae received a call from Pitt’s Office
of the Provost informing him of the
nomination. _

Bartholomae was named the 2013
Professor of the Year for Pennsylvania
last month by the national Professor of
the Year Awards program. In addition
to Bartholomae, 35 other professors
were named state professors of the year.
Four different professors were named
national winners. . V

In addition to being a part of Pitt’s

English department since 1975, Bar-
tholomae served as department _chair
from 1995 to 2oo9. Since 2009, he took
up the department’s Charles Crow chair,
a position named after a" Shakespeare
specialist who taught at Pitt until 1973.

Bartholomae has been involved in
many of the undergraduate English
programs at Pitt, teaching courses that
range from literature to journalism.

Judy Kim; a senior majoring in Span-
ish and minoring in Chinese, studied in
Beijing with Bartholomae last spring as
part of the Pitt Multi-region Academic
Program, which is also known as Pit~
tMAP. She affectionately refers to him
as ‘‘Barth.’’ ;

Penn State, CMU plan to send» ‘Lunar Lion’ to moon

Susan Snyder
M C T Campus

Philadelphia ——- Pennsylvania State Uni- _

versity is racing to be the first college

~ on the moon.

Since 2011, a team of faculty, re-
searchers and students has been hatch-
ing “Lunar Lion,” a robotic spacecraft
that is four feet in diameter and weighs
500 pounds. The team hopes that by
landing the craft in December 2015 and
having it complete a prec_ise series of
tasks, it will win an international com-
petition known as the Google Lunar
Xprize.

“What we are doing was once the
business of national governments, and
now we, a university, are doing this,”
said Michael Paul, director of space
systems initiatives at the university’s
Applied Research Lab.

The project costs $60 million, and
donors have provided more than one-_
third of that amount. Paul presented
an update on the team’s work to Penn
State’s trustees during their meeting

Friday afternoon.

Of the 22 teams vying for the prize
—— the winner gets $20 million — Penn
State’s is the only university-led group,
Paul said in an interview last week.
Among the six other U.S. teams compet-
ing is one from Astrobotic Technology
Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company spun
off from Carnegie Mellon University’s
Robotics Institute in 2008, according
to the team’s website.

The task for Team Lunar Lion is_
clearly defined.

“We have to land a spacecraft on
the surface of the moon, return high-
definition video andlimages and move
the spacecrafffrom where it lands to
another spot 500 meters away,” Paul
explained. '

If Penn State wins, Paul said, the
university will use the money for an
endowment to fund research and ex-
ploration.

Since 2011, more than 300 students
and about 30 faculty members have
taken part in the project inla variety of
roles, Paul said. The project currently

involves 80 students and 12 researchers
in six of Penn State’s colleges across
four campuses. ‘

To develop a baseline design for the
mission, five students went to NASA’s
Glenn Research Center in Cleveland,
Ohio, where they worked with engi-
neers across many fields. Other stu-
dents began working on public relations
for the project.

“Right now we’re preparing for a re-
ally big PR campaign in January,” said
Ajeeth Ibra-him, 23, a graduate student
in aerospace engineering.

Ibrahim said the project had opened
a world of career choices to him.

The Collegeville,‘Pa., native said, “I
can’t imagine having gone through a
program like this and not working on
something incredibly innovative and
game-changing.”

Penn State’s project is being funded
through corporate support, university
resources and donations, Paul said. He
told trustees on Friday that the team
had made great progress in raising
money for the effort, securing $20

million of a targeted $30 million from '

corporate sponsors.

The project also has brought in $2.5
million in private donations, and the
team is seeking $20 million more, he
said. The university, which would not

I disclose the identities of the donors, is

providing $8 million.

On its website, the Google Lunar
Xprize describes itself as the world’s
largest incentive-based prize. The com-
petition is run by the Xprize Foundation
at the request of the Internet giant.

The team is conducting its workiin
the Applied Research Lab, a secure fa-
cility that does work for the Navy. The
group is working with fuels and highly
technical machinery.

“This is rocket’ science,” Paul em-
phasized. I r

‘ The hardest part of the mission, he
said, is landing the vehicle on the moon.
The Penn State team is studying the best
spot for landing and the best method
of locomotion to get there.

Hipster culture consumerism
questions its individualistic tenets

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist '

There has been a perceived di-
chotomy created between the
alternative hipster lifestyle
and mainstream consumer
capitalism. I know what you’re
thinking, and yes it’s true; I
purposefully used theword
“mainstream” there. We all
know the hipster credo: Obscu-
rity equates to individuality.
The reason why I assume
you are all well-versed in this
dogma is because of the fact
that the hipster lifestyle has,
whether you like it or not, made
a huge mark on our generation,
creating a thriving subculture
in the process. And whether
you have friends who are
staunchly underground or you,
yourself, have hipster tenden-
cies, the culture has affected
your life in some way, either
personally or tangentially.
Hipsterism may have af-
fected you directly, in that you
may genuinely be a fan of the

band Django Django, or it may i

have affected you indirectly,
through the impact the culture
has had on corporate con-
sumerism. However, despite
the perception that there’s a
dichotomy between the two,

‘ the hipster movement actually

plays, a surprisingly positive
role in our market economy,
demonstrating just how much
the U.S. consumerist culture
manifests itself in our every-
day lives.

Which, if true, would of
course be incredibly ironic,
seeing that the hipster move-
ment tends to harshly criticize

the act of “selling out,” or sub-
mitting to commercialization.

‘For instance, a band may be

immensely popular among the
demographic for a time, but as
soon as the band acquires a re-
cord deal, has its music played
on_commercials or begins to
frequent top-20 stations, it
becomes less popular among
hipsters. The Black Keys hap-
pens to be an example of this
very phenomenon. Then it’s on
to the next small, unpublicized
talent that arises.

Yet, despite this effort to
distance itself from commer-
cialization, the hipster-move-
ment is actually fueling a cycle
that is essential to capitalism.

If one were to look at the
sociological aspects ‘of the
movement itself, it’s seeming-
ly about members within the
group competing for placement
through the use of products
and brands as a means to do so.
And consumers vying against
each other is what turns the
wheels of capitalism.

Take the historic “keeping—
up-with-the-Joneses” mentali-
ty of middle-class suburbanites
as an example of competitive
consumerism. Say I have a per-
fectly functioning Honda Odys-
sey sitting in my driveway, but
one day, I.notice Mr. Jones pull-
ing up in a brand new Lexus.
Despite additional expenses, I
go out and buy one anyway, be-
cause Mr. Jones is a benchmark
to a social standard.

This sense of competition .

is evidently beneﬁcial for pro-
ducers, because it causes peo-
ple to continuously buy things

in order to keep up with one

another. And the same sense
of competition exists among
the hipster crowd, except Mr."
Jones is smoking an American
Spirit cigarette or listening to
music few are aware of. Howev-
er, purchasing these products
doesn’t individualize the hip-
ster, since some of these prod-
ucts are either unwelcomed or
'an.ti—individualistic.

Actually, American Spirit

cigarettes are a perfect ex-

ample of something proﬁting
off the hipster crowd. Owned
by the R._]. Reynolds Corpora-
tion,’the world’s second-largest

, tobacco company, the Ameri-
can Spirit brandis returning.

huge dividends to the company.
Perhaps because they market
themselves as being “organic”
and “environmentally friendly”
alternatives to their rivals —

two terms the hipster commu- .

nity strives to ‘associate itself
with — they are more popular
among hipsters as a way for
them to maintain their image.
Thus, this causes the brand’s
sales to boom during this cul-
tural hipster renaissance.
What is ironic, other than

the point that hipsters are .

feeding one of the world’s
largest tobacco conglomer-
ates, is that American Spirit is
neither organic nor environ-
mentally friendly. The brand’s
cigarette smoke still contains
more than 7,000 carcinogenic
chemicals, which contribute to
the smoking-related deaths of
over 400,000 Americans each
year.

Despite this, the hipster

subculture is the life—breath‘ of com-
panies such as this. Take Urban Outﬁt-
ters as another example. The company
sells the products needed to keep up
with the retro trends of today’s youth.
However, the company’s actions do not
follow the individualistic ideology of
the hipster movement at all. It’s merely

a facade — in other words, good busi-
ness. In reality, the company has a
habit of funding politicians who are
notorious for fighting for traditional
conformism, such as Rick Santorum.
Urban Outfitters President Richard
Hayne donated $13,150 to Santorum’s
campaign, which, of course, was rife
with anti—gay rhetoric. And owing to
the fact that the store quickly pulled “I
Support Same Sex Marriage” T-shirts
from their shelves after only a week, it
should be clear that Urban Outfitters

doesn’t support your individuality.

Expressing your individuality is
dicey when you have to do so by buy-
ing things. Even if a T—shirt made with
organic materials shows off at first
glance your high ethical standards,
unique personality and intuitive global
awareness, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t
made in a sweatshop.

As author David McRaney put it,
“You sold out long ago in one way or
another.” I

Posvar Hall's Brutalist architecture was popular throughout Acacl:ém‘t_.

'Il1at’s brutal: A history of Posvar Hall’s architectural stylings

Matt Singer
Senior Staff Writer

When Chitra Sharma first toured Pitt as
a prospective student, she saw Wesley W.
Posvar Hall on a Pitt Pathfinders tour.
At the time, she didn’t think that the
building was particularlyremarkable -
nothing about it stuck out as memorable
to her. Now, about two and a half years
later, Sharma still ﬁnds Posvar Hall a
relative oddity on Pitt’s campus.

“Now that I’ve seen so many other
Pitt buildings, I think that Posvar has
a really strange build and shape,” said
Sharma, ajunior studying ﬁnance and
business information systems. “It isn’t
like some of the older—looking buildings,
and itjust sticks out.”

As the largest academic building on
Pitt’s campus, Posvar Hall does stick
out. But not many people know why the
building is as massive as it is. And even
fewer know that this hulking building
is the product and a prime example of

Brutalist architecture, an architectural
fad that~swept through U.S. college cam-
puses in the 1960s and 1970s.
Posvar Hall’s Construction
Originally called the Forbes Quad-

rangle until 2000, Posvar Hall is named A

after Wesley W. Posvar, the 15th chancel-
lor of the University, who is best known
for creating the University Honors Col-
lege and the University Center for Social
and Urban Research during his tenure.

The building’s construction started

.in 1975 and ended in 1978. The exterior

of the 744,695-square—foot building is
made primarily of limestone panels,
which were common in Brutalist work.‘
Interestingly, the building’s architecture
actually combines prominent areas of
poured concrete —— one of the most com-
mon features of Brutalist work — with
areas of limestone. ‘
That’s one of the problems Franklin
Toker — a professor in Pitt’s history
of art and architecture department —
has with Posvar Hall. Toker is critical of

much of the building’s design and con-
struction. He said he tells his students
the price differential between the two
materials — limestone and concrete -

V is so large that it doesn’t make sense to

have non—uniform materials. I

Toker said that the national excite-~
ment over the use of poured concrete

in architecture had dissipated by the
time construction began on Posvar Hall
in 1975.

“The excitement of a poured—concrete
building in 1948 is hardly going to be
the case of a building opening in 1974 or
so, so it’s a generational issue,” he said.

Although it might seem strange that
poured concrete was used in addition
to the limestone panels of Posvar Ha1l’s
exterior, there is a clear reason as to
why it was done: Brutalist architecture
was very popular when Posvar Hall was
being built.

Brutalist Architecture

The Brutalist style of architecture

originated with the European architect‘

Le Corbusier. After World War 11, Le
Corbusier decided to divert from the
then-standard methods of architectural
design. At that point, Modernism was
the principal architectural style, and
it emphasized simplistic, unadorned
construction. 7

Le Corbusier adopted poured con-
crete as his preferred method of exterior
construction, and this became one of
the most telling signs of Brutalist work.

Poured cbncrete, Toker said, “is re-
ally the soul of Brutalism.” This tech-
nique was used in place of cut stone, and
one of its most identifying traits is the
residual sign of construction. This usu-
ally takes the form of hundreds of holes
on the sides of the building, which are
indicative of the texture of the wooden or
metal frames used to place the concrete.

“The old style was to rub it smooth
and paint it,” Toker said, “and Le Cor-
busier said, ‘No, no, no. This is part of

Britishisms invade the US

It started with ‘cheers.’ Are tea and scenes next? MCT Campus

Jack Trainor
Stq/ff Wrz'ter

Whenever I hear Americans use the
term “cheers” to mean thanks, I think

. of that “SpongeBob SquarePants” epi-
sodewhere he raises his pinky ﬁnger in

the air to look fancy. The gesture alone
conjures an image of Brits sipping tea
(the episode is even called “Tea at the

' Treedome”).

This nod to British culture isn’t just
happening in children’s cartoons. Use of
words and phrases that were formerly
considered exclusively British, or Brit-
ishisms, has become something of a
linguistic fad for Americans.

As University of Delaware English
professor Ben Yagoda confirmed in a
New York Times article last year, British-
isms are becoming increasingly popular
in the United States. He even started a
website to track the rise of British slang
in America, “Not One—0ff Britishisms.”

Some British terms have become so
popular that most Americans probably

wouldn’t know they came from across

the pond. For instance, the term “gin—
ger” has surpassed the American term
“redhead” in popularity when describ-
ing someone with naturally orange hair.
In fact, you might even think it sounds

weird to call someone a redhead today.

Another one, in all its irony, is “soc-
cer.” Yes, soccer -—- the uniquely adopted
American term for what the rest of the
world, especially Britain, calls football.
Upper—class English citizens used the
term “soccer” through the majority of
the 19th century until it was replaced‘
by “football” in the 1880s. By this time,
however, American football was already
in the process of becoming popular in
the United States, which is why the term
didn’t stick over here. _

There’s something about Britishisms
that seem more elegant than American-
isms, which could explain why Ameri-
cans are using them more and more.
Long-time Netﬂix customers will recall
the company’s use of “queue” instead
of the bland term “list,” in reference to

up and continued in the future construc-
tion of many buildings.

John Conti, a freelance writer for the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, who writes
about architecture and the preservation
of historical spaces, said that Brutal-
ist buildings were still built after the
initial excitement over them had faded,
because Le Corbusier’s style was revered
by academics.

He said that architects taught Brutal-
ism in colleges in the 19605 and 1970s
because it was “the trendy thing” among
the academic architecture community.
And although there are some Brutalist
houses, museums and public buildings,
the style waspredominantly used in uni-
versity settings.

“And some people say that’s because
the academics were excited by Le Cor-
busier and the new forms that he created
—-— in this case -- by using concrete,”
Conti said.

Posvar Hall’s Brutalist Exterior

Posvar Hall’s poured-concrete and
limestone exterior is telling of its Bru-
talist design. After being laid between

. beams that framed the concrete and gave

it shape, the concrete was then poured

and took the shape of its surroundings. "

This method was used in lieu of a more

common practice of stacking individual
blocks on top of each other as the only
architectural method implemented.

Another of Posvar Hall’s most notice-
ably Brutalist features is its blocky ap-
pearance. The construction of Brutalist
buildings is traditionally bulky and mas-
sive, with large overhangs often jutting
out of the building.

As one of his critical observations

of the building’s Brutalist roots, Toker

noted that though the Posvar Hall over-
hang facing Bigelow Boulevard can, in
the event of rain, keep pedestrians dry,
there isn’t much other purpose for such
a large structural piece. It’s confusing,
Toker said, that the overhang exists
without any function beyond shielding
passers-by from the elements.

He described the building as one of

"‘giganticism,” remarking on the build-

ing’s colossal stature. He also said that
Posvar Hall is muscle-bound. But, he.
asks, “Huge muscularity leading to
what?”

“It’s unclear  And all of these years
later, it’s still confusing. I think because
the building never explains itself, or the
basis for certain decisions,” he said.

Posvar Hall’s Brutalist Interior

Students who enter Posvar Hall from
the entrance on Bigelow Boulevard are
immediately greeted by a huge open
space with elevators and doors to class-
rooms on the sides.

  Pitt graduate splits time
between politics and music

BnHobox
4104 Penn Ave.,
Lawrenceville
Doors: 8 p.m.
Admission: $5

Nate Hanson is used to not sleeping. Just

' a year after graduating from Pitt, he is al-

ready employed by the Pittsburgh municipal
government by day, and he plays guitar for
his Lawrenceville-based psychedelic rock
band, Shaky Shrines, by night. Needless to
say, he’s a busy man. i ’

“I don’t think I know how to not be busy,”
he said.

Every waking second in Hanson’s life
seems to be ﬁlled with something. When he’s
not working in a Downtown office, he’s prac-
ticing and writing songs for his band, which

just released its ﬁrst record, Mausoleum.

There seems to be a lot of Hanson’s inﬂu-
ence in the record —— the songs are all guitar-
heavy and swiftlyrhythmic, with intense
strumming that’s almost as fast as the way
he talks. One song is even aptly titled “Can’t
Quit.” This is what it must sound like inside
Hanson’s head with the perpetually caffein-

A ated lifestyle he embraces.

Between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:30
p.m., Hanson wears a gray tweed jacket to
an office Downtown. He works ﬁve days a
week as the administrative and communica-
tions manager for District 7, which includes
Bloomﬁeld, Lawrenceville, Downtown,
Friendship, Highland Park, Morningside,
Polish Hill and East Liberty.

There, he applies his media expertise to
constituency services, where he uses the
official District 7 Twitter and Facebook ac-
counts to announce important events that
pertain to the residents of District 7.

His announcements pertain to commu-

nity meetings, places Mayor Luke Ravens—_'

tahl will be speaking and even when trash
pickup is running late.

“That’s one componentl love about my
job,” Hanson said. “A lot of people get into
politics thinking about power or ambition.
But to me, the most satisfying part  is that
immediate relationship that comes with
helping someone.”

His government activities often continue
even after leaving the office. After hours,
Hanson usually attends meetings of Propel
Pittsburgh Commission,’ of which he is a re-

cent nominee. The commission is composed‘

of 15 members between the ages of 20 and 34
who are “dedicated to meeting the concerns
and needs of the city of Pittsburgh’s young
adults and young professionals,” according
to its website. ‘ l
’ Hanson credits his communication and
media skills to his time spent as the station
manager at WPTS, P_itt’s student-run radio
station, during his senior year in 2012.
“Nate was successful in that role,” WPTS
General Manager Greg Weston said. He add-
ed that Hanson positioned “the station in
as advantageous a way as possible. I’m not
surprised he’s gone on to a career in politics.”
Even now, with all the responsibilities
that come with being in a band and having
an office job, Hanson rarely allows himself _to
rest. “I would be totally lying if I were to say
that I’m not extremely ambitious,” he said.
His focus is always nailed to the present,
something in which he takes immense pride.

By the time he gets home around 9 p.m. “

most nights, he’s thinking .about “band
stuff,” which is often just aspects of media
and communications applied to music.

“The music side and the government
side aren’t as far from each other as you’d
think,” Hanson said. “They both allow me
to do things that I really want to do.”

Not only does he play guitar for the band,
he’s also jokingly described as the band’s
chief operating officer. Hanson diligently
updates the band’s websitegresponds to
emails and handles all of the media-relations

. ._ ‘In his writings on the building, Conti
hasgdescribed Posvar Hall as “awkward”
and “ungainly.” He questioned whether
ovrvnot the building makes efﬁcient use
 massive amount of space.

 If/for Sharma, this space can’t be used
fiirlmuch else aside from the student
d-L‘a—n;ce teams who practice there —— the
(in y example of which she could think
ofa:Epractical application of the expanse.

 ‘¥Like I said, I think some student or-
gfanizations can utilize that space. Other
 that, I don’t really think it’s neces-
 for there to be such open space on
theﬁrst ﬂoor,” she said. “I mean, they
[could] have made classrooms bigger, or
put more classrooms in, or made differ-
ent rooms that weren’t for classrooms,
like maybe recreational rooms.”

Tymon said the building’s loping dye?

“There are lots of nooks and crannies

he has sent over an Excel spreadsheet in a
Google Doc for something band-related,”
said Shaky Shrines singer and co-songwriter
Braden Faisant.

puters and band communications, he and
Faisant get together to write songs probably
“four out of seven days a week,” Faisant
said, noting that Hanson’s goal—oriented ap-
proach helps keep the band moving forward.
“Obviously, his work life inﬂuences the
band, and_I am entirely grateﬁll, because
he keeps us organized and goal-oriented,”
Faisant said. ’ '
On Sundays, when most Pittsburghers
are busy watching the Steelers play, Shaky
Shrines practices from 9 a.m. until 6:30 p.m.
Although they did a release show for Mau-

soleum at The Shop in Bloomﬁeld on Nov. 2,
“we’re notas big on playing shows,” Hanson
said. Instead, the band is more focused on
diligently recording and releasing music.

Incredibly, they’ve already recorded
another EP and are set to record their
follow-up ﬁull-length record over the next
two months.

Despite Hanson’s demanding schedule,
he has found a way to make time for both
music and his government job. ,

“I wouldn’t say one has affected the oth-
er,” he said. “If anything, they complement

  
   
  
  

each other nicely.”
He recalls some advice his adviser at Pitt

once gave him, which was to cut down on the '

caffeine and just relax. “But I don’t want to
do that,” Hanson said, ‘pumping his ﬁst. “I
don’t want to relax at all. It’s working well
for me at this point.”

In fact, if he could, he probably wouldn’t
sleep at all. “I’l1 have time to sleep later,”
he said as he sipped his perpetually ﬁlled
coffee mug.

“Hopefully not for a very, very long
time,” he said. I 2

academic community, it was soon re-
placed by a new style: Postmodernism. In
this style, architects actively try to make
buildings that fit in with already-existing
architecture, Conti said. _

_ One example of architecture built in
the Postmodernist style is PPG Place, a
complex of six buildings located Down—
town. Postmodern buildings made great-
er use of columns and vertical structures,
as demonstrated in PPG Place’s clean,
upward construction.

This shift back toward columnal,
high—rise architecture was meant to be
an aesthetic change, rather than an al-
teration made.out of technological ne-
cessity: Postmodern architecture wasn’t
meant to be ornate or showy, but rather
economical and practical.

“Those kinds of buildings have obvi-
ously been more popular than the Bru-
talist buildings,” Toker said. “Many of
the Brutalist buildings like Posvar Hall
simply weren’t well done,” he said.

The lingering unpopularity of the Bru-
talist style still affects h.ow people feel
about its manifestations.

“Somehow, I'walk into Posvar and I
get the sense of ‘Big Brother knows best,’
which is an irritating prospect,” Toker
said. “Nobody likes that idea.”

He said that this may stem from the
time in which the building was designed
and built — the 19605 and 19705. To
him, that time period was “a moment
of tension between ‘Big Brother knows
best’ and everyday people saying, ‘What

To him, Posvar Hall seems “c_l'ictat-
ing.” But it also has a utilitarian purpose:
The building pulls together all ofthe so-
cial science.departments and puts them
under one roof, which was needed at the
time of the building’s construction, he
said. Since the Cathedral of Learning
houses the humanities and the admin-
istration and middle—campus buildings
contain the sciences, there was a need
somewhere for the “orphaned” social
sciences, as Toker described them, to
go. This need for a large shared academic
building played a role in determining the
size of the building.-

For some, Tymon included, big isn’t I ‘

necessarily bad. He likes that the build-

ing is spread outward instead of upward, -

unlike many other buildings on campus.
Sharma said thatin the past she had

' tried to study in Posvar Hall, but she

wasn’t pleased with the experience.

“I didn’t like it. It was lonely, because
it’s such a big building and it always
seems empty after classes let out.”

Since there’s no consensus on wheth-
er or not the building is built in a way
amenable to day-to—day activities, it’s
difficult to make a decisive statement
on Posvar Hall. g

But for Toker, there’s one thing about
it that pleases him. '

“My end feeling is that luckily, just
about all the University of Pittsburgh
buildings built since Posvar have been
superior,” he said. “So I take comfort
in that.” g

Now that the binge-watching of mov-

(largely thanks to Netﬂix), Americans
are more exposed to Britishisms than
ever before (since perhaps the Revolu-
tionary War), British entertainment and
blockbuster hits such as thejames Bond

immense success in America, allowing
Britishisms to run rampant on our tele-

true American equivalent to “cheers,”

generally reserved for friends or infor-

the dividing lines have slowly been dis-
solving, as both American and British

Pitt, Penn
State renew
rivalry

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt and Penn State face each other in‘

basketball for the first time in eight years

tonight at the Petersen Events Center as ’

a part of the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. The
matchup comes as a part of what’s billed
as “Rivalry~Week” and follows Pitt’s 84-

67 victory against Duquesne in the 82nd-

City Game Saturday.

While the Panthers do not play the
Nittany Lions each year, as they do with
the Dukes, freshman forward Michael
Young looks forward to playing the game.

“Every game has some importance,
and we haven’t played them in a while.
It’s something new,” Young said. “We
play Duquesne every year that we get up
for, but playing someone new who’s also
close to us will be exciting, also.”

Young played his freshman year of
high school basketball at Shadyside
Academy, and his hometown is listed
as Duquesne, Pa. The proximity of both
Duquesne and Penn State present games
that Young says the Panthers are “ex—
cited” about.

“It’1l be a fun game,” Young said. “I’m a
Pittsburgh kid, so to play Penn State and
to play Duquesne is something great.”

Additionally, in the Panthers’ young
season, Pitt has played just two of its
seven games thus far against teams from
power conferences (Texas Tech and Stan-
ford in Brooklyn). While Penn State is
not one of the major players in the Big
Ten, a matchup with another big school
adds another layer of intrigue to Tues-
day’s game.

“We’re very excited,’.’ Young said. “We
haven’t played Penn State in years. So

good opportunity for us.”

The proximity of the schools resulted
in redshirt senior forward Lamar Patter-
son, from Lancaster, Pa., being recruited
by both Pitt and Penn State. Beyond

that, playing another team close to Pitt -

is something Patterson likes.

“It’s nice to have an in-state battle like
that, since we’re not playing Villanova
anymore. Playing against Duquesne and

playing against Penn State are good little ‘

games,” Patterson said. -

In recent history, Pitt has won the last
ﬁvegames between the schools by an av-
erage of 25.8 points, and Penn State has
not beaten the Panthers in Pittsburgh
since 1978. Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
is 3-0 against the Nittany Lions, and the
last game between the schools in 2005
ended with a 91-54 Pitt victory. The Pan-
thers’ 37-point margin of victory is the
largest by either team in series history.

“Obviously it’s a rivalry that we’re
all well—aware of,” Dixon said. “We look
forward to it.”

The Nittany Lions (6-2) enter the con-
test coming off a loss to Ole Miss that
ended a five-game winning streak that

included wins over Bucknell and La Salle.
Guards Tim Frazier and DJ. Newbill lead
Penn State into action as the team’s top
scorers out of the backcourt.

N ewbill leads the team at 19.5 points

1‘ per game on 52 percent shooting, and

Frazier averages 18.5 points while shoot-
ing a 47.4 percent clip. Dixon cited the
experience of the guards — Newbill,
a redshirt junior, and Frazier, a fifth-
year senior — as the reason for their

Alongside Hendricks, Vinopal earned
a reputation for his penchant to force
turnovers as he led Pitt by catching three

23, throw a redshirt year in there, what they
were when they were 17 is just a complete
transformation for obvious reasons.”

Limiting the effectiveness of Penn State’s
scorers is a priority for Dixon’s Panthers.

“I think those two guys are the key,” Dixon
said.

But alongside the Nittany Lions’ talented
guards, Dixon stressed the capabilities of
Penn State’s frontcourt players as ones the
Panthers cannot ignore.

“The big guys are skilled,” Dixon said.
“They can step up out and shoot the ball,

‘they shoot threes at ﬁve different spots.”

Travis leads the Nittany Lions in rebound-

- ing at 8.3 boards per game and averages

11.6 points per game. Penn State, as a team,
records just under 36 rebounds per game,
while the Panthers average a hair under 40
boards per contest.

“We know they can score,” Patterson
said. “Their bigs can shoot the ball, they’re
attacking, we know that much-about them.”

For the Panthers, Patterson leads the
team in scoring at 17.1 points per game.
Patterson is also among Pitt’s leaders at 5.4
assists, 4.9 rebounds and 2 steals per game.

While the Panthers are playing a unique
opponent, their strategy for the game is no
different than the one that has them on a sev-
en—game winning streak to start the season.

“We’re just going to play our game,” Pat-
terson said. “Get in the paint, attack them,
‘hit open shots, just keep it simple. We’re not
going to change anything.”  H
