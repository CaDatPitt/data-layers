  STUDENT SUICIDE J

FRONT PA GE“ PLA Y-UP——BO, WMAN:

COMPLEX Is

'-“The so-called student. suicide
‘complex’ is" almost wholly a matter
of ;front pageplay-up,” said Chan-
kcellor J ohn~G.' Bowman in an‘inter-
lview this week. “If we ‘should
"count the--suicides -among the peo-
pleof alldages and stag: of life,”
Dr.’ Bowman added, “we would ﬁnd
suicide and suicide attempts fairly
-and equally ‘ distributed among
them.” ’

‘Suicides’ are no more prevalent
among college students than among
any other group of people, he be-
lieves.‘ -  - - '1

_  Mont R. Gabbert, head of the
philosophy ‘department, believes
that; the materialistic spirit of the
age ‘has no bearing on the student
suicides. “It .is necessary to con-
sider the background of each case,”
he stated. “Many students are al-
most‘A'continually' on the ragged
edge ﬁnancially, causing overworry.
Health and ‘the liver must be con-
sidered.‘ Some turn to suicide in
the -midst. of the doubts and de-
spairs arising,from love affairs. In-
tense study and work, likewise, may
leave" the student in a mood for
suicide.” -

. No doubt, student suicides are a
fad,’ like ‘rolling hose and wearing
goloshes, Dr. Gabbert suggested.
.“.One starts it, and others are "given

_ “William James has said that -no
intelligent’ being comes to -maturity
without‘ contemplating suicide at
some time or other,” Dr. Gabbert

_“The recent suicides among;co1-
lege and high school students is not
a startling phenomenon at all,” be-
lieves Dr. Manuel C. Elmer, head of
the department of sociology. “The
relative percentage of the sixteen
college suicides tr the entire school
population is small when compared
to ~the- percentage ‘of ‘suicides to
population in a large city.” They

Dr_. W. N. St. Peter,.profess.or of

ward suicide. Dr. St. Peter. attrib-
utes the suicides to the unlimited

lege ‘students. This‘ continues‘ until_
the day of reckoning, usually, at the
end of the term. In thefew. cases,

and accepts suicide as the best way

in some cases. » ' ‘
Students Make Statements
The - trend of suicides may be
traced _largely to religious inﬂuence
in the lives of the-youth, in the opin-
ion of Fred Woltman. ' “Young
people,” he said, _“are brought up
in a_world of mysticism, with all the
reahties of -the world carefully hid-
den from them. -.When they sud-
denl_y_ come in contactwith all the
realities of_the world, often for the
.ﬁ.rs.t time in college, they become
disillusioned, realizing that life is a
struggle, that’ mankind is selﬁsh.
Some who have the courage end it‘

call, the remainder merely lose their

ilIusions.’.’ '
Richard Murphy,co,uld take hope

‘if the presentnumber of suicides

were motivated by._any rational de-
cision regarding the futility of life.
“But for the "most part,” Murphy
continued, “-the seventeen individ-
uals have killed themselves because
of love affairs or returned ,‘checks..
There is no indication of any ma-
ture‘ decision, any rational judg-
ment.” Murphy believes it is a case
of too little learning, - rather than
too much learning. ,

' “Christianity ‘leads the youth to‘
expect too much, and when the’
reality of life comes through study,
it leaves an overwhelming _sense of
futility in life,” is the opinion ,of
Frank Butler, who is in favor of
suicides,‘ contending that‘ it requires
great courage. “I was -raised in a
church -Where everything. is decided
upon , supreme authority. Whe

Students Favor ‘Language,
Study,‘ Questionnaire Shows

 

Students do-‘like some courses!

This much was_ revealed when
Mary L. Stevenson, instructor in
modern languages,‘ ' submitted a
questionnaire to her class, asking
for a frank opinion as to the value-
of modern languages. No ‘names
were required. And-the answer was
overwhelmingly in favor of her
courses. -

The answers. as to why the stu-
dents‘ like foreign languages were
tabulated, and found, according to
Miss Stevenson, to numbe; six. The
reasons were: Disciplinary value,
great literatures, cultured value, so-
cial advantage, languages spoken; by
millions of peopl‘e' and patriotic
action. _

What was particularly remark-
able about the unsigned answers, she
noted, was that no student took the
thing asa joke, but everyone showed
an "attempt to stat- his views clear-
ly. The reasons advanced for taking
the course were apparently not
“hand-shaking” for nothingwas to
be gained. _

Saﬁer’s Statement

In commenting on the. question of
regulations,. Saﬁer said: “The senior
‘court is convinced that the freshmen
as a group. are desirousof creating
and developing class spirit by means
of reasonable regulations. The seni-
or court has been and still’ is anxious
to aid the freshmen in. this develop-
inent. But such development can
come ‘only when the freshmen rea-
lize it will be primarily to ‘ their
beneﬁt and to the bezieﬁtj of the Uni-
versity. They must realize that they
alone can accomplish such an end;

“The spirit" or feeling of antagon-
ism‘ between freshmen and upper-
‘classmen must disappear at" the
start. The big organizations on the
campus are in sympathy with fresh-
men and are willing to assist in the
development of spirit. All" that re-
mains" i_s the necessityfor initiative
on the part." of the freshmen. -With

coon CA-STING, POOR’ ACTING   .  
MARK SHOWING: OF ‘BELINDA’,

By the Man With the Axe.

Pitt Players, sci‘-olisant campus
dramatic organization, presented
Belinda, -a"three act comedy by
A." A. Milne‘, in Heinz House‘ last
Thursday evening. It’s too late to
doanything about it now. All rooms
are ‘furnished with hot and_.cold
running water, and the publishers
positively guarantee-that if the book
fails to please, money will be cheer-
fully‘ refunded. It is expected that
with the completion, of this charming
suburban addition, property values
..in the immediate neighborhood will
be doubled. After a short honey-
moon_to Niagara Falls, Buffalo and
New York, the young couple_will‘ be
at home to friends atithe Schenley
Apartments. ' .

But we digress. The play’s the
thing. Let’s get started.

We believe that this latest Play-
er’s effort had several things for
which it ‘should be commended. In
the. ﬁrst place, we’ve always main-
tained. that Madame‘ MacQu‘een’s
casting is well-nigh perfect-‘. I-That
holds true for Belinda. As a matter
of fact, _ it’s almost impossible ‘for
Player’s"actors to spoil a play, (and,
they do try, oh,‘ -so hard) because,
they have been so well cast. Then,
the settings were the most intel-
ligently ‘designed and executed we
have= seen. in three ‘years of Heinz
house shows. Take a .bow,‘_.Mr..
-.Whitehead)’. And’ last, but not least,

.the affair’--'~aetually_‘ started at 8:30

o’clock sharp. . p .

The play itself is‘one of". those
goshawful whimsies Mr. Milne
-chucks off his chest now and then
with ‘such -whole-hearted "abandon.
It's about a ‘woman who has-been
separated from herhusband for 18
years, the separation being brought
about because he wouldn't shave his
beard. (Isn’t Mr. Milne ‘-cute!)

‘~ Well, anyhow, he returns after__18

years,‘ and here his wif

Pitt Instructors, Students
Give Deﬁnitions of Petting

-Petting is considered “fondling”
by'Webster, but interviews with Pitt
instructors and students show the
inadequateness of the great lexico-
grapher’s deﬁnition. ‘

. Two dozen campus deﬁnitions
range from “a brief interval of
agreeable. proximity” given by F. V.
Stearns, member of the Physics de-
partment, to‘ “lovemaking of sweet-
hearts” given by Mr. F. Wagner,
glass blower at Mellon Institute. _

Following the lead of the New
York World in its war on the thea-
‘ter, we cannot'publish all of the
deﬁnitions, but several interesting
ones prevalent on the Pitt'campus
follow: .

Petting is. to love what sentimen-
tality is to literature—-an uncalled
for display of emotion, a college so-
phomore believes. "

Petting is a sympathetic reaction
of the nervors system, an officer in
the R. O. T. C. states.

, Petting is the practice of excess
‘familiarity, is the deﬁnition given
by another faculty member.

Petting is a type of sublimation,
according to O. C. Held, of the
Psychology department.

Dr. Day Deplores Churches’
Clinging to Old Creeds

 

Deploring the readiness of the
church to cling to old creeds, the
tendency of business to determine
what it can do onthe basis of
what it has done, and the inclina-
tion in education toward building
the. child into the pattern of the
community, Dr. Albert E. Day, pas-
tor of Christ M. E. church, spoke
on “Human Nest Habits” before a

. meagre audience at +‘ 0. college-
business administration assembly
last Friday. Dean L.‘ K.’ Manley

of the school of business adminis-
tration, presided, and Dr. Mont R.
Gabbert, head of the philosophy de-
partment, offered the invocation.

in the value of hard __work. The
fashionable idleness of the classes
causes the idleness of the masses,

Initial Number of Spanish
Newspaper Appears Friday

Investigation Shows Candy - v
. Stand Popular 'Wi”th'*Pro'fs

Is a prof ‘sweet?

The answer is_yes, according to 4

workers _at the candy stand, in Alumni
hall. Although no deﬁnite ﬁgures
could‘ be obtained, the majority of
girls employed as dispensers of the
delicacies agreed‘ that the number of
Pitt faculty memberswho» regularly
patronize the stand is‘ much larger
than ordinarily thought.’ Out of a
total of almost 175 teachers having

classes daily in Alumni hall, approxi- ’

mately 100 purchase candy, they
claim.

men consumed more sweets than
women, although they are not far
ahead. Workers stated. that~'there
was ‘no noticeable difference in the
kinds of candy selected by b_oys and
girls. . ﬂ ,

-Peanut butter sandwiches broke
the tape in the number ofsales last
week, with Hershey bars and penny
pretzels a close second and third.
Most candy is sold between 11 and 1
o’clock on Monday, Wednesday:-and
Friday, with Friday leading the
other two days. -

Allwthe girls working at the stand
play ‘?'the altruist, by volunteering
their services without -remuneration,
working in shifts of an hour apiece
on the alternate days of -the week.
The project is by_ no means a private
ﬁnancial enterprise, explained Betty
Zeigler, who 1S1I1 charge of the stand.
All the proceeds, amouiitingfto $100

a month, or a total of $1,000 a year, '

is given directly to- Y. . A.,
which sponsors the project. Miss
Zeigler supervises the stand. as a
member of the Y..W. C. -A. cabinet.
Over a score of girls assist-her.

Running true to‘ form, the Delta

"Sigma Delta basketeers advanced

another step toward the D”en_tal -
League championship by defeating
the Alpha Zeta Gamma team in an
easy contest at Trees gym last Mon-‘
day night. Despite the occaslonal
spurts of the A. Z. G’s, the Darragh
street aggregation, led by Corrigan
Lowry and Mullen, scored almost a

"will throughout the contest. _

The powerful scoring machine of
the Psi O’s, winner of the cup last .
year, got under way in the second,
game of the evening and handed the
'17‘-‘°-SODllS’ another lacing to the tune ‘
of 41 to 12. Smith, starring for the
victors, hung up a record for ‘the
season _by caging ten "ﬁeld goals.
Dr. Frick, who officiated, called but
three fouls, two for the pre-sophs
and one for the Psi O’s,"a1l of whIch
were caged. ,.

The Zips and the pre-frosh tan-
gled in the third and ﬁnal -game of
the evening, the pre—frosh wmnmg,
38-14. Schugar, Dimeo, Garver,
Jackson and Schussette showed real
form from start to ﬁnish. George,
with two ﬁeld goals and two out of
two fouls, was the outstandmg man
for the losers.

Thursday night the Zips took re-.
venge for their defeat last Monday
at the hands of the pre-frosh by de-
feating Alpha Omega, -28 to 17.
Cantor and Cohen were thestars for
the losers, while the whole team, led
by’ George and Whitnour, played
well for the Zips. «

The other game scheduled forlthe
evening was not played, the Jumors.
forfeiting to the Alpha Zeta "Gam-
ma, 2-0. I -_

Contrary to the story printed In
last week’s issue of the Weekly, the
pre-sophomore team was not re-
leased from the Dental League. The
team that was dropped from the
league on account of forfexts was
the sophomores.

Pitt Men, Not Co-eds. Equal
' Europeans Intellectually

“Pitt co-eds are not as intellectual"
as European girls, but they are more
congenial,” thinks Anna Rab1no-
witz, Ed. ’28, winner of the $100
scholarship awarded annually_by
Phi Sigma Sigma, social fratermty,
recently. ’

“Men- at Pitt,
European students
she says. .

Born near Warsaw, Russian Po-
land, Miss Rabinowitz ' came to
America only five years ago. With
a background of a Polish gymnas-
ium education, including six years
of Russian and Polish, French,
Latin, German, mathematics, his-
tory and science, she is now‘ holding
an honor scholarship at. the Uni-
versity.

Last ‘semester, with a nineteen
credit schedule of courses, her marks
included six A’s and one B. At
that. she doesn’t work hard‘ at her
studies, she says, and ﬁnds time
enough to do outside work Satur-
days, holidays and vacations. She
is a member of Delta Phi Epsilon,
national Society sorority.

The scholarship awarded this
year to Miss Rabinowitz, is given
by the local chapter of Phi Sigma
Sigma to a junior or sen'ior.co-ed.
Leadership, personality and scholar-
ship are considered in the award.
The committee choosing this year’s
winner consisted of Mrs. .'Lotte
Lohstoeter, member of the German
faculty; Ida Reich, Dorothy Knina
and Sadie Saul, members cf the so-
rority. ' '
