_J. B. VVlllSOl’l,"09,"Wl‘1teS, April 17,
from 69 North Fullerton avenue,
.Montcla1r, N. J., as -follows;

On April 4, I was ordained and in-
stalled pastor of the Montclair Reformed
Presbyterian (Covanter) Church, Mont-
clair, N. J., so my student days and
wanderings are over for the present... I
was preaching: in Walton, N. Y.,- during
February and in Cambridge, Mass., dur-
ing March. Found occasion to commend
our University in general and our foot-
ball team in’ particular to the attention
of some Yale and Harvard people whom
I met. One strikes connecting links with
the past wherever‘ he goes. I have met
a woman here who knew well my old
classmates, George M. P. Baird and Clar-
eilce A. Reece in Avalon. I ‘felt at home
with them at once. Will you please
have my WEEKLY sent here. I haven't
seen a paper for some weeks as it has
not been forwarded me from home. The
last issiie I had a chance to read through
contained a letterfrom Paul Howe, Ex.
'16, from France. I taught Howe one
year in High School, so was specially
glad to see his letter. I am_glad to "be
settled permanently now so that I can
get the WEEKLY regularly and not
miss any of the news. I always turn to
the Alumni page first. If you see any
of my old college acquaintances give.
them my regards. - '

SHEA’S RUNNING

of, the Philadelphia
“North Ame_'rican,”i has the following

 

sports critic
comment regiarding the feats of the
"Pitt men at the Penn games:

“Frank Shea, Pitt’s ﬂier, did the
bravest bit of running yesterday that
thus been seen on.Franklin Field -since
the halcyon.days‘of Ted Meredith.

“The Panthr lad twice carried the
blue and gold to Vnotaable victories in
Pen(n’»s twelnty"~four'tlh. annual relay
-carnival. «

“Shea’s first quarter mile in the
Class'B college cham-pionshrips was
turned in 49 ﬂat seconds and an hour
later the ‘ Western Pennsylvanian
breezed over the 440—yard stlretch in
the remarkable time of 48 3-5 seconds.
‘ “In doing the last trick, Shea .-put
Pitt in front with the one—.mile‘col-
lege relay -'ch=a*mp~i-onshiip of America_

“Each time when Shea started this
last relay ‘heiwas in the ruck. The
first time he had 25 yards to make“ up
and -in the classic event he was 20
yards to the bad when he took the
baton.

"N-o one/:but aiShc~a or Meredith
could have come through. under such
=t'ryin'g conditions. It took a stout‘
heart and extraordinary speed to win,
but Shea was game eachtime and
won with plenty to’-spare. ‘ .

“Shea is the national ‘A.-j.‘A. U.
quarter mile champion" and in his two
da.ys—’—stay at Franklin Field carried]
off three first prizes. On Friday Pitt
