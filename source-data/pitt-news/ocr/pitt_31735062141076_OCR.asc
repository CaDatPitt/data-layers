‘the information office today:

A five point “for the duration”
platform, featuring as its most..im-
portant plank the emphasis of the-
student’s contribution to the war

. eﬂ"ort, was offered today "by the In-
, dependent party executive commit-

tee as its major campaign note.

The platform, issued by party
leader Hiram Milton, C42, calls
for, in effect, not only an increase
in so-called “war-time activities,”
but also urges a specific curtail-
ment of those activities not con-
nected with the war effort.

“The idea that activities can con- .

tinue as usual, an idea which seems
prevalent among fraternity leaders
at this time, is stupid,” said Mil-
ton, “for a failure to modify the
existing program of activities to
meet the war emergency is to ad-
mit that critics of college students
are light when they call us imma-
ture and unrealistic.”
The gylatform calls ‘for:

1. An increase in the import-
ance of the war effort on campus,
and a subsequent decrease in the
time and money being spent on ac-
tivities signiﬁcant neither to the
war effort nor to any<reconstruc-
tion program following the war.

2. A campaign for cooperative
student housing, a co-op book-
store, a cooperative eating place.

3. The curtailment of expensive,
money-losing dances.

4. The creation of an inter-city
collegiate discussion group, be-
tween the colleges and Universities
of the city, which, with their re-
sources pooled, could bring to
Pittsburgh nationally known speak-
ers to lecture on contemporary af-
fairs. Such a board could also be
used for the discussion of prob-
lems affecting all collegians, rath-
er than those of one college or
University.

5. Compulsory physical educa-
tion and a. subsequent increase in
the emphasis given to total partici-
pation in intra-mural athletics.

Meanwhile, the fraternity domi-
nated executive committee of SFA
had not yet released the names of
approved candidates for publica-
tion as this issue of the “News”
went to press. It is expected that
the committee should have the lists
out in time for announcement in
Monday’s paper.

Voted down by the committee
was the Independent’s petition to
install voting machines in the Ca-
thedral and in State Hall to facili-
tate the balloting in Wednesclay’s
election.

Politics are not exactly new on
campus. There are usually a few
SFA petitions circulating and it

is not unusual to ﬁnd students

working for one candidate or an-‘
other.

It is unusual, however, to find a
young pre-med student scouring
the Tuck shop and Commons for
signatures and votes on behalf of
her husband, who is also enrolled
in the University.

That is, it would be unusual for
any one but Leaugeay (pronounc-
ed “Lo-jay”) and Albert Curry,

who seem to make a point of do-

ing the unusual.

Leaugeay started it when she
entered Pitt just six months after
the birth of her daughter, Leau-
geay, determined to fulﬁll her am-
bition to become a doctor, a am-
 as   been  ‘v

ler, E43, is business manager;

' Rhea Krisko, C43, invitations; Wil-
liam Cronemeyer, BA42, Albert
Steinkerchener, C44, and Peggy
Smith, BA42, decorations.

Other members of the committee
are:

Vincent, Matera, C42; Betty
Toohill, C43; William Stormer, C42;
William Seyler, C42; Martha Wan-
drisco, C42; Robert Lesko, BA43;

wig, BA48; Charles Cusick, E43;

sidetracked by three years of mar-
riage. ' .

Last summer the Curry’s doings
made newspapers all over the
country and resulted in an appear-
ance on the radio program, “We,
the People.” That was the time
husband Albert, who had just been
appointed Republican committee-
man of his district, decided he

ought to know his constituents, and

proceeded to~send out 850 mime0—
graphed postal cards, one to each
family on Wilkins avenue, invit-
ing them to a party.

The ﬁrst Leaugeay knew about
it was when Albert ‘asked, “Well,
are you ready for the party?"
“What party?” she gasped. But al-
most before Albert could answer,
the telephone began ringing. Be-
fore that phone stopped ringing
they had calls from the three 10-
cal papers, in addition to Bulletin

$262.50. Despite a slight decrease
in stamp sales this week, the com-
bined totals in both bonds and
stamps for the day-—-$462.75——
were still sufficient to break the
former sales record for a single
day}
Wednesday’s new high in total
sales has raised the campaign to-
tal to $1,942 in less than two

.months. The tendency to increase

sales totals records each week in-
dicates the likelihood of an unex-
pectedly large amount of money
going from here into the United
States treasurysbefore the cam-
paign closes. S

It is likely that the campaign
will end with the launching of the
Iowa early this summer, but it is
just as likely that stamp sales will
continue, though on a different

theme.

Construction progress on the ac-
tual battleship is assumed to be
rapid, although military. secrecy
does not permit the publishing of
detailed information on the sub-
ject. C

about the party.

That party rated a front-page
spread in the New York Herald-
Tribune and it was only the im-
patience of the Life photograph-
er that prevented it from being the
subject of “Life Goes to a Party.”
That gentleman left the Curry
home at 8 o’clock the evening of
the party when it looked as though
the only guests would be the news-
papermen.

But at 9 o’clock there were some
ﬁve or six hundred people jamming
the house and the next morning the

Currys received a phone call from’

the indignant Life photographer.
Leaugeay still can't get over the

itself, so that it may be less mur-
derous ? So far as science _has pene-

.. The advantages of these two moves to the
fraternity candidates are obvious. Possessing
a strong, uniﬁed‘ group, the Greeks are as-
sured of at least 900 basic votes, that is if
the elections are held anywhere between the ‘I A

To students for whom it is not
convenient to take such courses,
and for handy references at home,
the following is the ﬁrst of a series
on the most important subject of
vitamins.

There are various kinds of vita-
mins, each kind having I its own
characteristics and functions. They
are still frequently designated by
the alphabetical names which were
assigned to them before the chemi-

_cal structure of the vitamins was
known. But the chemical-names are
increasingly displacing the alpha-
betical names.

The following groupis known as

A, thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboﬂav-
in, (vitamin G), nicotinic acid, pyri-
doxine (vitamin B-6). -
Other vitamins are ascorbic acid
~-(vitamin C), vitamin D, and vita
min K. :
Dairy products, fruits, vege
tables, eggs, whole grain products,
-ﬁsh and lean meats provide all the
’ vitamins that are known to be es-
sential to the body. For this reason,
even though vitamin concentrates
are now being manufactured com-
mercially, their principle use should
be in curative medicine.
Vitamin concentrates are of

lLa Spade, Cengiai,-.Sl1ucl<, Helbling
Carry Local Hopes at Annapolis

Pitt’s riﬁe squad, consisting of six shooters, one manager,
"and two coaches, left Pittsburgh this morning at 9:05 aboard
a train heading for Annapolis, Maryland, where they will com-
pete in the intercollegiate National Riﬂes association tourna-

ment tomorrow.

Comprising the Blue and Gold entry are: marksmen Larry

Spada, Bruno Cengia, Bill
Shuck, Johnny Helbling, Bob Ben-

nett, and Jerry Haywood; manager

Dick Stein; coaches Lieutenant
Havlak and Sergeant McDonald.
The group will arrive at An-

napolis approximately 6:43 o’clock
this evening and will immediately

U. S. Naval Academy.

Members of the Panther bullet
brigade seem conﬁdent and deter-
mined to shoot their best, but the
coaching staif does not feel so op-

Etimistic over the outcome.

“Our boys can lick any college
in the country when they’re in their
own back yard, but shooting away
is a different story. We have not
had enough shoulder-to-shoulder
matches, and this factor may also
prove disastrous,” declared Serg-
eant McDonald.

A major proportion of the local
attack will be shouldered by Larry

make their headquarters at the '

La Spada, captain and veteran of

four seasons. Larry is the most
consistent shooter, copping the top
honors in six of the team's eight

postal series. In last year's nation- _

al tourney at Washington, D. C.,
he was the whole “show” for Pitt,
placing eleventh in the entire na-
tion for individual performance.

To top it all, the quiet, unassum-
ed Panther expert just missed mak-
ing the “Golden Bullets,” the oﬁi—
cial all-American riﬂe team, which
consists of the ten top marksmen
in the country.

If La Spada gets some help
from gunmates Bruno Cengia, Bill
Shuck, and Johnny Helbling, who
all, incidentally, have come up fast
this season, the Blue and Gold will
certainly ﬁnish somewhere near
the top.

Following Saturday’s ﬁrings the
party will head homeward Sunday
morning at 7:40 o’clock and arrive
here at 5:30 o’clock in the evening.

Stickel Breaks
Indoor 50-Yard

Dash Record

Harold “Hap” Stickel toglt
the spotlight last Wednesday,
afternoon at the annual Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh chain'-
pionships when he established
a new indoor record for the 50-yard
dash by beating teammate Bill
Carter in the time of 5.3 seconds.

The 50-yard dash record wan
previously held jointly by Stickel,
Carter, Cooper, and Fleming. The
Wednesday’s time of 5.2 second:
just misses the world record by
one-tenth of a second.

Second only to Stickel’s record
shattering race was the upset of
Bill Curtis in the mile by junior
Mark Allias. Allias surprised all
concerned by traveling this dis-3
tance in 41:35.3, minutes, beating
the number one. miler, Bill Curtis,
by a good ﬁve yards.

Freshman Bill 0’Melia, Paul
Fischer, and Ivan Frey stole all
yearling honors last Wednesday
when they practically placed, one,
two, three in every track event‘.
Fislier and O’Melia tied for the
high jump title, Fischer won both
the broad jump and the pole vault,
O’Melia won the 12 pound shot

put, and Frey took first in the high. _

hurdle race. a

Besides the 50-yard dash, Stickel
won the low hurdle race in 6.1 sec-
onds, and placed second to Poplis
in the high hurdles. “Dusty”
Rhoades did not have any competi-
tion in the pole vault with Jessup
absent, and took the event with the
height of 13 feet, 3 inches.

The only event held last Tues-
day was the 880—yard race in which

‘Bill Curtis beat out junior Bob

Davis by a step in the time 2204.8.

Administration Denies Rift
Between Bowser, Players

The inference made by a down-
town newspaper last Wednesday
that there was an impending revo-
lution amongst the ranks of Pitt’s
football team was merely journal-
istic sensationalism. Everyone ques-
tioned on the report, from the
coaching staff to the team manag-
ers, denied any rift between head
mentor Charlie Bowser, the play-
ers, or the administration.

According to the newspaper ac-
count three players, Jack Heister,
center, Ralph Hammond, quarter-

»- back, and end “Tex” Hinte had
been dropped from the team. While
this is true, the implications of dis-
sension made by the story are en-
tirely without any basis.

Heister repo‘ d for spring drills
last week andrequested his uni-
form. He was informed that he
had no uniform and-that he had
been dropped from the squad be-
cause of failure to attend winter
skull drills.

On the other hand, Hinte and
Hammond withdrew from the

squad voluntarily. Hinte is due to
be drafted soon and for this rea-
son alone, he has quit the team.
Hammond decided to drop foot-
ball as early as last season. He
played nearly all of the Pitt~Ne—
braska game only to ﬁnd himself
on the bench the next week. The
last game of the year found Ham-
mond‘not even showing up to sit
on the bench, and hasn’t reported
for the spring drills now being con-
ducted.

There is also a possibility that
another player who had been
-counted on for first string duty
next fall will be missing when the
opening bell rings. Quarterback
Walter West, who was granted a
deferment last fall, may be in the
service before the season opens.

With this possible hole in mind,
Bowser is working with halfback
Jack Stetler in an effort to con-
vert the speedy back into a signal-
caller. Thus, should West be called
to duty, Bowser would have an ex-
perienced player to plug the gap.

A The more I smoke, the more I appreciate
Camels,” says Miss Lewis at a late supper with
friends at the St. Regis. “Their cool, rich ﬂavor is
all the more enjoyable because Camels are so mild
—— with less nicotine in the smoke.” You, yourself,
try Camels. You’ll like everything about this
slower-burning cigarette of costlier tobaccos.
You’ll like that grand ﬂavor — and you’ll

. like knowing that there’s less nicotine in

the smoke (see below).

The smoke of slower-burning
Camels contains

28% LESS N|COT|llE

than the average of the 4 other
largest-selling cigarettes tested-
less than any of them-according

to independent scientiﬁc tests

of tbe smoke itself.’
