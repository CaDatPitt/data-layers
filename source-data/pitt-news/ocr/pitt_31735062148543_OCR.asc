Independents
Choose Date V
Of Convention

\Vl1ile fraternity men today
were discussing Interfraternity
Council’s decision to bring th.e
naming of fraternity ‘slates out
of secret caucus into the rela-
tive light of selection by the
Council, Independent party mem-
bers were preparing to‘ pick their
candidates at a public" nominating
convention. ' ' “

At their meeting Wednesday, th
Independent steering committee
announced March 18 as the date of
the convention. F

The nominating convention was
introduced on campus by the Inde-
pendents last year in an attempt to
make “den'i‘ocratic student govern-
ment” a reality. . ,

Independent candidates for Stu-
dent Faculty Assembly, College As-
sociation, and Men’s Council will be
chosen by the entire Independent
membership.

In addition to making plans for
the convention, Independent .lead-
ers were pushing their “card plan”
to enroll student voters. J, Members
of the Independent. organization

committee will spend the time be- V

tween now and April l2, date of
elections, attempting -;.to sign new
members. ~  l 

Independent leaders stuidentsi
not only to vote Independent but 
vote according to the slates to which ’

they are assigned. The latter re-
quirement is defended by Jack
Hoeveler, C40, party spokesman as,
“the only way in which we can hope
to compete with the fraternities.
Since the slates are chosen in an
open convention, there is no ques-
tion of so-called regirnentation."

  Files Show McCormick

Attended Few Classes

By Lew Riley
As the ﬁfth day of testimony in the trial of John Louis McCormick,
former University senior, began in Cleveland this morning, investigation
of University records by the Pitt News revealed that McCormick last at-

tended classes on December 8, thirty
one days before the fatal shooting
of Theodore Nicholas.

McCormick’s prolonged absence
from classes led to a “request” by
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the College, that the youth “With-
draw irom all of his classes,” it was
learned. The resignation form
dated January 22, said—-over the
signature of Dr. Crawford———that Mc-
Cormick was being asked to with-
draw because he “had not attended
classes since before Christmas va-
cation.”

Lost Interest in School

The disclosure lent support to the
belief that the erstwhile “model
student” had lost interest in all Uni-
versity classes and activities some-
time before his Cleveland “esca-
pade.” Described as “usually quiet,
and not much of a mixer” by his
fraternity brothers, McCormick
dropped active membership in a
campus social fraternity at the be-
ginning of last September.

Family difficulties were hinted in
an explanation of his action by a
fraternity brother, John Dickinson,
C40, who told the News that Mc-
Cormick had become inactive be-
cause “his dad didn’t want him to
remain active.”

Eye Witness Accounts

As a jury of nine women and
three men continued to hear testi-
mony in the trial yesterday, eye-
witness accounts of the hold-up
murder were revealed before a
packed courtroom by Louis Cata-
volos, who was in the Cleveland
Western Union oﬁice last January 8
when the slaying occurred, and
Ernest J. Pfeifer and Abraham
Letto’sky, Western Union employ-
ees.

Dentist ‘V ill Discuss

Proper Use of Amalgam

Dr. S. S. Haudenshield, Carnegie

of amalgam at a meeting of Delta

ternity in the School of Dentistry,

1 Slate Fraternity

Edmunds’ roposal Meets
With Unanimous Approval

By Rugy Aldiisert

The old cry of “1ne1-'it in politics” found a new god-
father this week with the explosion on thevcampus po-
litical front of 1'1'1te.1'f.ra.ternity Council ’s decision to slate
“deserving” fraternity ca_udida.tes for studeiit elections.

Instead of choosing slates by unofficial caucus meet-
ings, fra.ter-nity men will now use Interfraternity Coun-
cil as a formal‘ agent to choose and endorse candidates, ‘according
to the re‘vo]utionary proposal which met the unanimous approval of,
every house at Tuesday’s I-F Council meeting. Bill Edmunds, E40,
Phi Gamma. Delta, introduced the plan.

A1-though no defiiiite machinery for the operation of the new
plan has been set up, it  expected that each fraternity will have
the opportunity to suh.mit names for I-F Council-sponsored slates
for Student Faculty Association, lVlen’s Council, and College As-
sociation. The council, COIll*1’}0S'e(l of the president and another man’
from each'fr~atcrnity, would then cleilivhera-te and place its official
stamp of approval on a» certain number of slates.

Sorority Leaders View

I-F Act With Skepticism

Fraternity women were skeptical or, at best, 'unim'press'ed by the

the News Wednesday.

“merit in politics” move of Interfraternity Council, when questioned by

Betty Phillips, C40, president of Panhellenic Council, reflected the

5: attitude expressed by Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean of women, who,

commenting on the February 9 proposal of women’s Fraternity Presidents’

Council to keep women out of slate
voting, said:

“Block voting is Hitlerism brought

to the University; it is absolutely
foreign to theideals and aims of

modern educ-ation.”

Miss Phillips‘ stated:.‘.‘Therev isn’t
much gained by the action. They
(lnterfraternity Council) haven’t
got at the basic trouble with cam-
pus politics. It will still be a ﬁght
between fraternities and indepen-

dents rather than a question of
merit.
The probability that women

would be named on the fraternity
slates, in spite ofFPC’s action, was
deemed. unimportant by Miss Phil-
lips; “The women’s action in that
case would probably be governed
entirely by FPC’s stand.”

A contradictory opinion on the
latter question was held by Jane
Epping, BA40, honorary ROTC co-
er-colonel and a member of the
Theta Phi Alpha, one of the four
fraternities which opposed FPC’s
move.

“Of course, the women’s fraterni-
ties will. continue to cooperate with
the men’s fraternities on the slates,”

,Miss E-pping insisted.

Although it was impossible to
reach Helen Wilson, C40, president
of FPC, for an expression of opin-
ion, Gertrude Broido, C40, Alpha
Epsilon Phi and a member of FPC,

cited an unusual angle on the situ-
ation by her comment.

“Although I can only speak for
myself,” she said, “I believe that
IF Council’s decision was a wise
one. However, the attitude of fra-
ternity women toward the new sys-
tem will be governed by how close-
ly the men stick to their princi-
ples.” — » .,

“If it is not just. a front or a
dummy,” she continued, “it may
ﬁnally result in the Women meet-
ing in a separate causus to pick

their own candidates and running

them on therfraternity slates.”

need by Edmunds and Jim Ken-

nedy, C40, Delta Tau Delta-,
council president,_.’is to “promote
merit to a greater degree and
give every fraternity an equal,
chance in the selection of polit-
ical candidates.-” C

Whether or" not] the official‘
slates will include fraternity wom-
en and studentsin, the School of
Dentistry, familiarly known‘, as the
“Dent bloc,” _:was not discussedvat-.*
this ,week’s meeting. Kennedy and:
Edmunds in_dicated, however, that
this point would 
probably be uis-7
cussed at future
meetings ef I-‘F,
possibly at next
Wednesday’s ses-
sion. _f ,
This week’s de-
velopment came
as a siirprise to
campus political
followers and
even “caused a
majority of fra-
ternity men to raise their ‘eye-»
brows. Edmund’s proposal was the:
aftermath of a resolution introducecl
at a previous council meeting which“
called for the submission of ideas
from each representative for the»
purpose of “improving the status
of I-F Council in the eyes of Pitt
students.”

The oﬂicial pronouncement on the
plan as released by Kennedy and
Edmunds declared:

“Since politics D0 exist, organi-
zation is deﬁnitely needed to pro-
mote these politics on as high a‘.
plane as possible. It is believed
that through I-F council, where
each fraternity is represented by
capable leaders of their own choos-
ing, this end can be reached. 7

“Each fraternity will have an
equal voice in political policies and
in the selection of political candi-
dates to represent the group.

“Merit will be promoted to at
higher degree than ever before
because greater democracy will
exist within the group.

“No policies for the coming cam-
paign will be discussed until the
next scheduled meeting (I-F meets
next Wednesday evening at the
Phi Ep house). Rumors that any
deﬁnite plan , has already been
made regarding slating, selection
of candidates or policies will be
just rumors and nothing more.”

Commenting on the proposal,
whose merit provisions bear strong
similarity to the platform adopted
at the Independent Party conven-
tion last year and later also util-
ized by the unofficial fraternity
slates, Jack Hoeveler, C40, Inde-

of the beauty of navy, that is the]

Spring.’ And there we were graph-.4

icjally shown that this was the year
to be gone with the trend of
American fashions, from‘ which

we have adapted the ‘Pittriotic-‘

theme for your tashionshow.
Our lessons didn’t stop ._the_re,
for belonging‘ as we do to‘ the
most famous fashion orgainzations
in the worl.d, “we constantly re-
ceive style lessons direct from the
minds of the foremost fashion de-
signers and trend arbiters. 'l.‘hat’s
why We-say, “That’s absolutely
right; you're right!” when you
chose your wardrobe .from our
fashion show. _ ;
Here are some of the trends’ to
look for in the fashion show and
to keep in mind when selecting
your C. Spring and Summer war:
drfobe. ‘The trend for Natural
Fashions; feminine, but frivolous.
Or, to expound, not reeking feme
inity, but the essence, of feminity.
Note the long-torso ‘suits, the off
the face hats, the dainty lingerie
trims, and the new make-up; nat-
ural color, sparingly applied. ' _
Watch for thetrend for Effi-
ciency Fashions; fashions that are
dutiful, as well as beautiful.
Clothes that are-iadaptibl.e to being
combined with other wardrobe fa-
vorites, Par example, the jacket

., dress: take it apart, wear the dress »

alone or wear the jacket with oth-
er dresses and it still keeps ticking
and in time with any place or
occasion. All this talk of color co-
ordination is no idle chatter, it’s
an important part of this effici-
ency trend. Never before have
you been able to do more fascinat-
ing tricks that look exactly right
with sweaters and jackets and
blouses and skirts, and accessory
contrasts.

And for the final, biggest trend
of all...Americana Fashions in-
fluenced by the two Americas, de-
signed by American designers for
American women.

. ‘With all of the rest of the world.
practically, going through sense-
less war maneuvers, our military
spirit is best shown on dress pa-
rade fashions for. women. We sa-
lute freedom‘with our red, white
and blue fashions; we tip our hats
the South. American way.

Nothing is smarter for daytime
wear than navy with white and

red accessories. Remember: it's"

red for beauty, blue for duty,
white for dress parade; We cheer
navy because it is a grand base
for all important Spring accessory
manouvers. Try it with the afore-
mentioned white and red, with
gold, beige, blues, pinks, -gray
and tan and with sparkling black
patent bags, shoes and belts. But
remember there are tricks to the
contrasting accessory game. We
have all the colors, but our sales
people are as carefully instructed
in the proper ways to combine
them as tho they were sticks
of dynamite and not colored bags,
gloves, hats, shoes, scarves, etc.
So we advise your consultation
with them in making up your
scheme, for they have studied the
situation and know the right com-
binations, just as YOU kn0W YOU?
chemistry formulas. (Judging
from personal experience, we
might add, even better.)

We’vei borrowed tricks of trim
from the standing army and navy.
1940 trim fitting jackets, braids,
shoulder trims, Sam Brown type
belts——all show that there is
something about a soldier that is
fine for feminine fashions.

Nor have designers stopped con-
tent with today’s army; they’ve
gone back to Federal fashions
borrowed from the years when At-
lanta’s destruction was a truly
burning memory" and not a back-
ground for Vivien Leigh’s Acad-
emy Award. Some fashion creators
have gone ’way back to the early
days of America and comeout
with Revolutionary cockades and
braid.

And from South America we

have borrowed everything from

or of South America has been
brought north of the border to
brighten up your Spring and Sum-
mer in prints and gay combines

In all this Americana rush, we
havenft forgotten to pick patterns
and fashion ideas from the daily
American scene. Witness the Sym-
bol prints on dresses: Greyhound’s
fleet—footed trade mark, Ballan-
tine’s three rings (Get it!), Plan-
ter’s grinning peanut vender and
many others. And a popular Sun-
day night radio program went to
America’s foremost women millin-
ery designer’s head; Sally Victor
has cooked up a hat trimmed with
six delicious—-you’ve guessed it-—-
flavors, strawberry, raspberry,
cherry, orange, lemon and lime!

So there’s your fashion lesson
as we’ve learned it; there are
your trends. We don’t need to tell
you how to look pretty in them:
they were made for your beauty
and youth, but We are glad to
show you how to make the most
out of the trend of your choice.
Our knowledge is at your disposal,

Close Season

In their last encounter of the

year, Pitt basketballers tomorrow’

the. second» time this season. The

which they found themselves
against Carnegie Tech recently. ..:In
that game the Tartans scored a
two point~decis‘i'on on the Skibo

ﬁrst. clash-’b.etwe"en the two schools;

' West Virginia‘, “averaging three
wins in every3 four" starts, sports a
recordless tarnished than the un-
predictable'.Panthers. It is ‘expect-
ed that Homer Brooks, captain and
scoringstar, will play in the battle
at Morgantown, although he did not
compete at the Stadium.

3 Sophomores Ruch and Baric will
be on hand to add more woe to
Pitt’s hopes. Baric, the larger of
the “field goal twins,” tallied 17
points on his last appearance at
Pittsburgh. Chepko and lV.[andich
make up the rest of the starting
quintet. '

Four Pitt menuwill see action for

the last time. They are Bob John-
son, Jack Scherer, Charley Ptacek
and Danny Vujnovic. Although.
Vujnovic has been on the varsity
only two years, "he was inactive in
his sophomore year after transfer-
ring from West Virginia. . ‘

Entries lswellt A
For Intramural
Spring Athletics

An increasing number ‘of inde-
pendent mushball entrants has been
the result of? the extension of the
entry deadline for the spring intra-
mural program until next Wednes-
day. ‘ A .

March 20 has been set as the ten-.
tative date for the actual opening
of the campaign by the intramural
department. Another extension of
the entry -‘date would naturally
move the first games back another
Week-

However, that should not be so
great a factor in the postponement
of competition as the weather. Con-
tinuance of current weather condi-
tions would result in an indeﬁnite
postponement.

The intramural oﬁice in Trees
Gym has a supply of entry blanks
for the four sports offered in this
spring’s intramural program.

Blanks may be had for mushball,
tennis, horseshoes, and golf. Teams
and individuals will come under
one of "three classiﬁcations: frater-
nity, independent, and engineers.

Trees Gym ﬁeld athletic facilities
will accommodate three of the
sports: mushball, tennis, and horse-
shoes; but the lack of a golf course
necessitates the use of the Schenley
park links for the golf tournament.

The whole program this season
will be run -off round.-robin style,
rather than the previously tried
double-elimination system.

After Stopping Oil & Gas

.Revenge and the desire for the

intramural basketball crown will
spur the Jerks’ quintet on when
they meet the defending Phi Kap-
pas today at 4:30 on the Trees floor.

In their ﬁrst meeting the Phi
Kaps topped the Jerks by a 33-30
score to move within one game of
their second. successive basketball
title.

' Both teams were guilty of exces-
sive roughness in that game, which
saw key men from each quintet lost
on personal fouls.

The fraternity champs will again
be banking on all-intramural for-
wards Tom Halloran and Jack Glenn
to bring a victory. In Monday’s
game Glenn paced the Phi Kaps by
tallying 14 points.

Jerk Trio Outstanding

Independents are counting on
center Vince Anania, guard Bob
Malloy, and forward Jack Stetler
to avenge their previous defeat.
Any one of this trio is capable of
upsetting the dope and the Phi
Kap’s hope for another basketball
title.

Tom Halloran, Jack Glenn, Butch
Goodell, Dick Cassiano, and John
Tyberski will probably make up

the defending champion’s starting
roster.

The Jerks probably will. "start
Vince Anania, Jack Stetler, Bob
Malloy, Ernie Bonelli and Larry
Klotz.

Should the Phi Kaps be defeated,
the two teams will be forced to play
again to determine the intramural
winner. A win, however, will bring
the fraternity leaders their second
straight championship. '

Jerks Whip Oil & Gas

By virtue of their 37-23 Victory
over the Oil & Gas team Wed-
nesday, the Jerks gained the right
to meet the Phi Kappas in the sec-
ond stage of the double elimination
series for the intramural basket-
ball title.

Both teams started slowly, bank-
ing upon a passing game to shake
men loose for scores. The Oil Sr, Gas
quintet irequently showed signs of
uneasiness and passed to cover up.

Footballer Ernie Bonelli, playing
with a bandaged hand, shared his
team’s high scoring honors with
teammate Malloy. Each registered
three ﬁeld goals and a foul for sev-
on points.

Seals while the Defrosters, who had
previously shared ﬁrst place, were
whipped by the Penguins, 44-34.

Starting strongly, the Coldspots
built up a wide margin, until mid-
way in the ﬁnal period when the

ever, the Seals’ rush was halted
with one minute to go. Ed Masten,
Seal captain, led the individual

Waging a tight battle throughout
most of the ﬁrst half, the Pen-
guins drew away from the Defrost-

Fraternity Choices

Continued from page one
pendent Party spokesman, said:

“Merit and ‘merit’ alone is a ﬁne
ideal but it somehow sounds famil-
iar. The fraternities ﬁnally realize
that they will have to match the
high standards set up by the Inde-
pendents if they hope to remain po-
litically alive. I have always felt
that active, honest, and clean poli-
tics would bring forth the best can-
didates from both parties. This
year’s pre-election activities seem
to prove it-.”

Offering what he said was his
personal view on the Edmunds pro-
posal, president Kennedy said:

“It is something that should have
been done long» ago, which is reach-
ing its-culminating point now.”

Sponsor Edmunds stated:

“I- believe itis a sincere effort to
getvthe best man for each job.”
Four Political Developments

This adds another chapter to the
turbulent political history on cam-
pus this year-—a year which saw
the following developments:

1. Independent Party leaders,
patterning.‘ofga-l'1lZlng= tactics after
tho.se of labor unions, sponsored a
“gala mass meeting to acquaint Pitt

students with campus politics”
(Quotes taken from party hand-
bills).

2. Twelve out of 16 women’s fra-
ternities endorsed a resolution spon-
sored by Fraternity Presidents’
Council calling for them to abstain
from aligning with political slates.

3. Pharmacy school students cir-
culated a petition demanding the
right of franchise in student gov-
ernment.

4. SFA executive committee
pushed up the traditional election
date a week ahead ostensibly be-
cause the presidential election year
limits use of voting machines.

Comment on this week’s bomb-
shell was not forthcoming from
many fraternity heads. The major-

Wing Authors
‘Rights’ Article

Hugh A. Wing, instructor in Eng-
lish, is the author of an article on
“Democracy and High‘ Education”
in the current issue of the American
Teacher, monthly magazine of the
American Federation of Teachers;

Mr. Wing says that democracy, if
it is to work, depends on two prin-
ciples: “. the right of every
man to make his contribution to
the general group knowledge and
decision; and second, the right of
every man to hear the trut .”

In his conclusion, .Mr. Wing says,
“We must constantly stress that
democracy is a system of society in
which every interested party says
his say, everyone has a right to list-
en freely and then, on the basis of
this pooling of information, and
judgment, everyone participates in
making those decisions upon which
the welfare of the group depends.”
