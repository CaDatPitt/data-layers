inal collect-or. It is nowin the Sthool

and the student who wished toMsuMbsti-
wtute other studies for ancient . plan-

guages could only do so by permission

of thevfa‘culty, not always" wi_llingly
«granted. As‘ there was little desire for

classical knowledge in PitMtsbMurgh,v a
course had’ been e_stablis_hed8 prior to
18708in whichsome modern llziiiguage
replaced Greek and Latin. Th:1s,- in

accordance with the practice in many

of the ~ojl-d-colleges was called the
“Scientiﬁc Course,” alzthough With the

.modest facilities generally axjailable

and limited time given -to the »sciences,
1t'scarce1y merited the name “scien-
tiﬁc.” It extended over three years

and included a meager allowance of

various sciences scarcely, greater in
amount than w.as«requ‘ired in the
classical course. M 8 , V

Between 1875 and 1883 an improve-
ment was‘ gradually made in this re-
spect. and students in‘ -the “Scientiﬁc
Course’-’ were given better facilities
and more opportunity for science
study. In 1870 three groups of study
were open to students, the Classical
(4 years); the ,Sc_-ientiﬁc ._(3 years),
and the Engineering (4 years). The
latter was_subdivideVd into Civil and
Mechanical courses. Catalogues earlier
than 1870-71 were not preserved in
the University ‘archives.

WILLIAMSON

 

The one lone regret of the W. and
J. game last Saturday excluding the

ruling of Referee Crowell in ejecting
Halfback VVilliamson from the game,
with the resulting penalty of half the
distance to the-goal line, for alleged
rough work. With all due respect to"
Mr. Crowell’s ability as a gridiron ar-5‘
biter, it is thought that he erred on
this decision. ,

‘All the players whoiwere close to
the play in question, \agree that the
decision was a bad one. And, also, of
all thernen playing the ‘grid game to-
day, V\/illiamson is one of the ﬁnest
exponents of. the cleanigame.“ Itewas
certainly an ill-timed incident, and all
those in a position to know hold‘Wil-
liamson blameless. I
