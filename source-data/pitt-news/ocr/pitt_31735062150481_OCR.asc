Trips To South. West Are
Scheduled

The tentative subject for this
season's debates, as announced at
the Debating Association smoker
last Friday, will be “Resolved:
that the federal government should
appropriate money for the aid of
unemployment.”

Try-outs for the squad started
yesterday when several of the old
members spoke before the Asso-
ciation. Candidates must deliver
ﬁve-minute speeches, choosing any
side of .the question which they
prepare.

The speakers at the smoker
Friday-were Walter Rome, gradu-
ate manager of student activities;
Professor W. M. Parrish, Richard
Murphy, coaches of the squad;
and Samuel Strauss, Col. '32, de-
bate manager. Professor Parrish
outlined the qualiﬁcations of a. de-
bater as follows: “A debater must
be personable. He should be able
to speak the English language. He
should be a logical thinker, and he
should have pep, vigor, and an
eagerness for preparing and pre-
senting debates.” -

Mr. Rome expressed the belief
that the Pitt debaters were the
best in the country. He stated
that for this reason the budget for
the Debating Association was cut
less this year than that of any
other organization on the campus.
The debaters have been alloted
$900 for this season’s work.

Murphy, Levin to Debate

Mr. Murphy announced that the
Pitt graduate team to meet a simi-
lar team from the University of
Nottingham, England, will . be
made up of Albert Levin and him-
self. Murphy also stated that, as
has been the custom in the past,
there will be no decision on any
debate. The audience will be for

 

‘the most part organizations such

as the Advertising Club, the
Shriners, and the League of Wom-
en Voters. ‘ ,

Strauss outlined the tentaive
schedule for the season as fol-
lows: Western trip-Northwestern,
Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, and
Oregon State.

Southern trip——Washington, D.
C., Virginia, South Carolina, Geor-
gia, and Florida.

At home——-Notre Dame, Cornell,
Dartmouth, and William and Mary.

All further information about
debating will appear on the bul-
letin board outside 220 Alumni, or
can be learned from Mr. Murphy
in the same room. ‘

F. R. Phillips Writes On
Unemployment Relief

The October-November number
of the, “Pittsburgh Record.” Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh bi-monthly
magazine, appeared last Tuesday.

local unemployment relief prob-
lems, and the « measures being

Mr. Phillips states that in spite
of the efforts made to meet the
situation, “At no time has the
emergency program been able to

take up the full number of known

unemployment cases.” He also re-
veals that the federal census taken
last spring showed 62,000 unem-
ployed ‘wage earners in Allegheny
county.

Other articles in this issue are‘: ~

_ Gaye F1-ooh, “Panel: D
My Card Please”

 

Believe it or not-one freshman
woman actually reminded a mem-
ber of sophomore customs commit-
tee to punch her card. She walked
up to the customs desk at Heinz
House, purchased a new armband,
and asked to have her card punch-
ed for appearing on the campus
without an armband.

Though custom committee is un-
accustomed to such a request, it
rose to‘ the occasion after a few
dazed moments and complied with
the fr-eshman’s demand, a ﬁtting
reward for such evidence of Pitt
spirit.

“The fans almost pulled my tail
of! at the Miami games," said Ira
Jones, Dent. ’32, the Pitt Panther,
“and a panther without a tail is
like a pig without a. whistle."
Jones learned panthering in the
wilds of Bangor, Pennsylvania, and
not in Easton as reported in last
week’s paper, The present panther
suit was donated to the University
last year by the Dental school.
The suit was made to fit Anthony
Hohl, last year’s panther, so that
when Jones got the job he had to
supplement his frame with a pair
of shoulder pads. The looseness
of the garment makes it useful as
a weapon, witness Jones lashing
his padded rear from side to side
in the encounter with the girls and
the photographer during the Miami
game.

Robert C. Clothier, dean of men;
Walter Rome, graduate manager

denhall, executive secretary of the
Y. M. C. A., andthree students
will form a committee to deter-

living in Oakland.

Dean. Clothier has felt an obvi-
ous need of some deﬁnite action
on the part of the University to
provide entertainment and fellow-
ship for students living in Oakland
boarding houses.

The committee will attempt to
from a plan whereby the Activi-
ties Building will be open evenings
for entertainment, study and social
events. A definite arrangement of
the program will be lannounced
later through the offices of Dean
Clothier and the Y. M. C. A.

CHANCES FOR PERFECT SEASON sR1g_HT

ﬁlilll NIITES

‘morning for Atlanta, Georgia,

, Bowling Green at Case Field.

Carnegie Tech left Pittsburgh this
where it
meets the Georgia Tech football team to-
morrow in what is likely 'l‘ech’s only op-
portunity for a victory over a major or»
ponent this season. .

The Tartans were defeated in their
ﬁrst major game last Saturday by Wash-
-Ieﬁ. Lack of a capable fullback and of
sumoisnt replacements were the main
causes of the Tech defeat. Tech will
probably be forced to play through the
remainder of its schedule with Bert Poun-
osy and Jerry 0’Toole, two linemen. at
the plunging post, and with but 24 men
on its squad.

 

An excess of beef enabled the Army to
swamp a plucky and smart Knox College
team at Michie Stadium Saturday after-
noon. The score was 67 to 6. but the
scrappy little eleven from Galesburg, Illi-
nois, deserved a better break. Only
Army's reserve strength, which Knox
could not match, and a heavy line which
repeatedly tore the visiting wall to shreds
enabled the Mules to roll up such an im-
preserve score.

Knox fought valiantly all afternoon, and
in the closing minute when trailing by
sixty-seven points it put over its touch-
down. If a team deserved to get that
much compensation Knox certainly did.
Smart, tricky football was repeatedly re-
duced to naught as the heavier Army for-
wards crashed through or well meant
passes found their way into the wrong
hands. Army clearly deserved to win, but
the one-sided score is no indication of the
fine fight put up by the westerners.

" The machine-like functioning of the first
Army string, which looked so well against
Ohio Northern last week was ragged, and
on the shouldorsof the second team rests

the credit for the large score. The re-'

serves played nice football to run over
touohdown after touchdown. while the big
team looked poor in spots. Glaring fum-
blesmarred the handling of the ball, wh-ile
several times the speedy Knox attack
crossed them up. In the last period the
third string went in but did nothing spec-
tacular.

Flashing a spirited attack under the
leadership of Captain Judy Lasich, who
accounted for the three Lion touchdowns,
Penn State set back Lebanon Valley by a
19-to-0 count on New Beaver Field Satur-
day rnoon.

With only ﬁve minutes of the first quar-
ter gone. Captain Lasich broke through
left tackle. reversed his ﬁeld, shook off

' half a dozen tacklers, and raced forty-two

yards for the first’ Blue and White touch-
down. Again. at the beginning of the
third and fourth quarters, the Nittany
leader plunged over the last chalk line
for his second and third scores of the
afternoon.

Except for a. ﬁfty-eight yard run in the‘

second quarter by W. Light, after he had
intercepted Bob Snyder’: forward pass in-

. tendedfor Phil Moonves, the Annvllle col-

legions did not threaten the Lion hopes
of victory.

Although they were held without a first
down in the first half. Coach Bob Higgins’
grid warriors rolled up a total of thirteen
in the last two quarters. The Mylin-
coached eleven managed to gain ﬁve first
downs in the first two quarters. while in
the second half the Lion defense limited
the number to one.

 

Cleveland, Ohio.——Greatly encouraged by
its line showing against the powerful Pur-
due team Saturday, Western Reserve opens
its home season Friday, October 9, with
Bowling
Green has tied Baldwin-Wallace and de-
feated Mt. Union, and it will be no setup

for Capt. Herb White’s Red Cats.

Coach Tom Keady learned a lot about his
men in the Purdue game. The majority of
the sophomores who were used came
through with ﬂying colors, especially Di-
Donato, at center, a very light but ag-
gressive player: Ivan Christmsn, tackle;
Lew Soloway, guard, and Bob Crum, full-
back. Keady was also very well pleased
at the showing of Vic Hurd at’ guard.
Hurd has been more or less an enigma to
the Reserve coach. He has played on and
03 as a regular for two years, and Keady
was undecided whether to use him at cen-

ter. tackle or guard. He will undoubtedly

start as guard against Bowling Green.
Keady will polish up his offense for the
Bowling Green game, and hopes to start
oﬂ with a home victory. The defensive
work against Purdue was excellent, con-
sidering the powerful attack which was
faced. Eddie Finnigan showed well at
quarterback, and the kicking of George
Malone and Bob Crum was very good.

-Tony Palmieri, who was used in the back

field. will probably be sent. back to the
line position, as the coach is satisﬁed that
he will do better there. Pslmieri is one
of the heaviest and most aggressive play-
ers on the squad.

Thirty-Five Still
Out for Gun Team

Initial try-outs are now over for
the varsity riﬂe team. The squad
now‘ consists of thirty-ﬁve men
who will be divided into two

squads for purposes of competl-,

tion. The ﬁfteen highest scorers
wlll.be chosen for the ﬁnal varsity
positions. The squad is still open
for any upperclassmen with rlﬁ
experience. -
A girls’ varsity riﬂe team is" now
in the process of organization.
The requirements and organiza-
tion for this team will be essen-

tially the same as that of the

men's riﬂe team. Practice for the
girls will be held in the mornings
from 9 to 12 o'clock, for the men
from 2 to 5 o'clock. The first var-
sity meet for the men will take

SA E Meets
Phi Eps In
Final Match

Clash To Determine
Fraternity Tennis
Championship

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Epsilon Pi will meet at 4 o'clock
today to determine the interfra.-
ternity tennis champions for the
present year. The former team
will be represented by John
DeWitt, a. candidate for the fresh-
man team last year, and William
Young, while the Phi Eps will de-
pend upon Maurice Gurin and
Eugene Solow, numeral winner on
the freshman team of two years
ago, to carry their hopes.

These two teams were scheduled
to meet Wednesday afternoon, but
due to the softening of the courts
by the rain that day, the match
was postponed until this afternoon.

TI-ounce Opponents.

The Sig Alphs won their way
into the ﬁnal round with victories
over Sigma Pi, Delta Sigma Phi,
and Omega Delta, respectively,

 

without losing a set until the semi. ,

ﬁnal match with the last named
opponent. The Phi Eps scored vic-
tories over Sigma. Chi, Sigma Alpha
Mu, and Phi Kappa, winning every
set in each of these matches with-
out permitting their opponents 1.0
carry one set to deuce.

Results -of the second round
matches aside from those men-
tioned above included Omega Del-
ta's victory over Pi Lambda Phi
and Phi Kappa’s defeat of Phi
Gamma Delta. The Phi Kaps won
their match by default when their
opponents failed to appear, but the
Phi Gams protested the forfeiture
on the ground that they had been
misinformed of the time of the
match. Action on the protest is
expected in the near future.

Frosh Win
Opener, 13-0

Weinstock Scores Twice;
Meet W.-J. Today

The freshman football team emu-
lated the varsity squad on Satur-
day, beating the team from Wy-
oming Seminary 13-0. Weinstock,
acting captain for the day, crashed
through for both touchdowns and
played a good game, both offensive-
ly and defensively.

Coach Gougler said that the
team, as a whole, played fairly
well for the first game of the year,
but there were still some wrinkles.
which had to be ironed out before
the game with the W. and J. frosh
this Saturday.

There were a few players who
were outstanding in their play dur-
ing the game. Nicksick made some
very ﬁne runs and played a good
game. Quarterback Ruckert was
on. the receiving end of quite a
few passes and also did all the
punting during the course of the
game.

Show speed, strength

Gougler stated that both Ruck-
ert and Smith, who showed plenty
strength and speed, should be real
threats when it comes to picking
the positions of next year's varsity
team.

Of the linemen, Ormiston, Kopo-
lovich, and Victor showed up par-
ticularly well. The team should be
in ﬁne shape for the game next
week and although not much is
known of the W. and J. squad, a
victory is foreseen for the Pitt
frosh. Games on the rest of the
schedule include those with West
¥lr,;-ainia, Klski, and Carnegie

in for the lighter events, 118, 125,
136-pound classes, with few claim-
ants for heavyweight berths. Or-
sini’s plea for heavyweights seem-
ingly being disregarded.

Outline Training

Preparatory work will be in
force from the present until De-
cember, with heavier work to fol-
low. The workouts will be one
hour long and will be lenghthened
to two hours later. The prelimin-
ary training will consist of 10 laps
around the track, followed -by
three rounds of shadow boxing.
After a. short rest, the candidates
will skip rope for ten minutes and
then will punch the light bag for
three minutes. Instructions on the
heavy bag will also be given, to be
followed by one round of shadow
boxing in the ring‘. To ﬁnish, the
men will run two fast laps around
the track, I

“I expected to see more students
out for the team,” said Coach Or-
sini, “but the material that has
reported looks good enough to off-
set the lack of quantity. We still
need some heavyweights. Any stu-

dent weighing 175 pounds or more
is welcome to report.

Makes Plans for Year ~

 

The Pittsburgh Field Hockey
Association met for the first time
this year at Trees gym last Satur-
day morning. This group was or-
ganized last year by Mrs. Mar-
garet Mcclenahan Greenwalt, for-
mer head of women's physical edu-
cation, for school teachers who are
actively interested.

It will continue this year -with
a team which may be able to com-
pete in the National Field Hockey
Tournament this winter. The asso-
ciation is under the supervision of
Miss Elizabeth White, instructor
in physical education.

Changes may be made in this line-
up for the trips to West Virginia
and Penn State.

Allegheny is bringing a fair
team to Pittsburgh. They will be
here to avenge defeats suffered in
the last two seasons. Pitt, though,
with its best team in recent years,
should come out on top.

Four Future
Rivals Lose

Major Tilts

West Virginia Eleven
Keyed Up For Pitt
Game Tomorrow

 

 

All things considered, the past
week has been an unusually
tough one for Jock Sutherland.

In the ﬁrst place, his team beats
Iowa so handily that experts
from every part of the country
are predicting an undefeated
season for the Panthers; and
then, only three of the seven
teams which Pitt meets later in
the season won their games last
Saturday, a condition which
seems to bear out the forecasts
of the above men and which will
make Sutherland’s task of keeping
his men keyed up for the import-
ant games to come all the harder.

Notre Dame, Penn State and
Army were the future opponents
of the Panthers who won their
games last week, but each of them
played minor opponents so that
their victories were not of the na-
ture to cause the stay-at-homes to
build bonﬁres, have downtown pa-
rades, and in general to do those
things which college students do in
the movies when good old Upton
upsets State. Poor State! ‘

Reserve Loses.

West Virginia, tomorrow's oppo-\

nent at the stadium, lost to Ford-

- ham, 20-7, with the Rams scoring

in every quarter. Western Reserve
lost to Purdue, 28-0, but the score
in no way typiﬁes the difference in
the strength of the two teams for
Purdue also played another game
that day and did not care to take
any chances of injuries to their
players in the game with the Red
Cats.

Carnegie Tech, which seems ‘at
this time, to have but one chance
to win a game with a major-college
team, that with Georgia Tech at
Atlanta tomorrow, fell before Wash-
Jeff; and if the defeat was a black

Just a sawdust-stuffed canvas sack, shaped to represent the human

the future holds in store for their readers, how best to tackle
each. Business men and engineers know the value of this, and

,, Irish vs. Wildcats.
Northwestern meets Notre Dame,
Pitt's toughest opponent this sea-
son, tomorrow ‘at Soldiers’ ﬁeld in
Chicago; and it is not improbable
t, t the national champion will be
(1 ided in this game. Northwest-
ern meets California (Southern
branch), Ohio State, Illinois, Min-
nesota, Indiana and Iowa in its
other games; while Notre Dame
faces Drake, Carnegie Tech, Penn,
Navy, Southern California, Army
and Pitt in its other games.-
- _The winner of Saturday's game
will be favored to win all of their
other engagements this season.
Pitt's hopes for national recogni-
tion lies in the ability of Notre
Dame to beat Northwestern and
-then in its own ability to beat the
Irish. If Northwestern wins, Pitt's

’ chances lie in an undefeated season
-as and a post-season victory over the

mid-westerners, the promotion of
such a game being under way at
the present time.

But to get back to Sutherland and
his future opponents. West Vir-
ginia in particular, reports from
Iowa say that Pitt could have
beaten the Hawkeyes by at least
two or three more touchdowns, if
it‘ so cared, a condition which

 ; makes West Virginia’s task against

Pitt tomorrow almost an impossible

0118.

Reports from the Mountaineer
headquarters during the pre-season
training period st-ated that West
Virginia was to be represented this
year by its best team in years.
Considering that most football
coaches are prone to be pessimistic
over their team’s chances for a
season, this report cast fear upon
the minds of future opponents.
The coaches of these teams were
somewhat relieved after the Moun-
taineers’ defeat last Saturday, and
there is a preyalent belief that
Greasy Neale's boys will also finish
on‘ the short end ‘of the score
against Wash-Jeff and Georgetown.
which last Saturday defeated West-
ern Maryland, the latter’s ﬁrst de-
feat in twenty straight games.

About all that West Virginia can

' hope to do against the Panthers to-

morrow is to hold them to a low
score, and its prospects for doing
so are not very bright. Its main
hopes lie in Greasy Neale’s bag of
tricks and the bitter rivalry be-

a- tween the two schools.

Keen Rivals.

If you are a regular attendant
of Pitt basket ball games and
watched those Mountaineers stand
in their zone defense for more than
ahalf‘ while the Panthers held the
‘ball in the center of the ﬂoor in
hopes of drawing the West Vir-
ginians out of their typical defense

“From what I’ve seen of the
candidates, I think we should have
a fairly successful swimming sea-
son this year,” said Coach Pat
Corr in reference to the prospects
of this year's natators.

“What impresses me most,
though,” he continued, “is the won-
derful spirit of the ﬁfty men on
the squad. The boys 80 at their
practice with a. vim that shows
their earnestness.” And then he
went on to discus the prospects at
greater length.

Many of the swimmers have
some outstanding achievements to
their credit.

Brothers Star.

Co-captain George Schmieler,
who began swimming when ﬁfteen
years old, has several national Y.
M. C. A. championships under his
belt. He has do e most of his
work from the divi -' board.

His brother, Joe, is generally
conceded to be one of the best
swimmers in Pennsylvania. Joe
co-starred‘ with John Carik on last
year's freshman team. Carik has
been taking first places in diving
meets with monotonous regularity.

One of the members of the team

was the athletic director at the .

Crippled Children's Camp during
the summer. When he was not
helping the children, he was swim-
ming -to ﬁrst places in various
meets. He won the 50- and 200-
yard free-style heats of the Canton
city meet. He is Jack Hanna.
Fred Warren, a freshman, won
the 100 and 220 free-style A. A. U.
championships of northeastern

Ohio at Cleveland during the sum-
mer. .

Assistant
who captained last year's varsity,
is optimistic about the coming sea-
son. He thinks the team should
develop into one of the best Pitt
has ever had. Wooldridge is a
booster of Patton, popular co-cap-
tain, and is of the belief that Pat-1
ton should go through the season
undefeated in his events. The
form of Denny and Davies, both
freshmen entering from Westing-
house, and that of Stinner from
Duquesne pleased him.

The work-outs this week were
light and were mainly to give
Coaches Corr and Woolridge a line
on the ability of the candidates.

 

the feelings between the members
of the two teams that meet in the
stadium tomorrow. o

The ﬁrst two .mentioned have
graduated, but the other three will
start against the Panthers. They
and their mates have had but one
thought uppermost in their minds
since the start of the training sea-
son, “Beat Pitt.” And if the psy-
chological feeling is not enough to
cause the Panthers an extra amount
of worry, Greasy Neale can open up
his bag of tricks, and what tricks!

But nevertheless, the Panthers
should win.‘ Last week, we said
that Pitt would beat Iowa either
20-0 or 27-7. As things later turned
out, the first one of these predic-
tions was 100 per cent perfect, so
the boys said that I was 50 per cent
right. Maybe ‘I'm crazy, but I
should rate better than that.

Last year, West Virginia claimed
that it had its best team in ten
years. It won five games and lost
a similar number. In 1927, Gibby
Welch and company beat the
Mountaineers. 40-0. Pitt could beat
them by a larger score this year if

it cared to do so, but it doesn't. .

Pitt will win by live touchdowns
tomorrow, 41-7, if you care for a
prediction.

"The; (iplgg) skin you {love to

motto for the football number of
the Panther which will -appear on

“It is the funniest, wittiest issue

he claims. “It fairly bubbles with

of the number is a special article

NO ARTIHCIAL F

With the assistance of Dr. A. P.
James, professor of history, and of
Alston Field, graduate assistant,
the Historical Survey of Western
Pennsylvania, for which the Uni-
versity added an appropriation of
$25,000 to the $75,000 of the Buhl
Foundation, is now getting under
way.

Dr. Solon J. Buck, former super-
intendent of the Minnesota Histori-
cal Society, arrived in Pittsburgh
during the early part of the month
to assume his duties as director of
the survey. He will also serve as
Director of the Historical Society
of Western Pennsylvania, as well
as professor of history at the Uni-
versity. He will also be aided by his
former associate in the Minnesota
organization, Franklin F. Holbrook,
who will act as curator of the His-
torical Society.

The survey will probably center
around four aspects of the history
of Western Pennsylvania: first, the
period covering the French and In-
dian and Revolutionary Wars; sec-
ond, the settlement of the region,
especially the settlers’ ancestry
and mode of living; third, the Pitts-
burgh region as the gateway to the
West by the Ohio River; and
fourth, the industrial and commer-
cial development of the region.
The new head of the Society be-
lieves that this last phase of Pitts-
burgh's history has been great
and intends to make it the object
of much of the attention of the re-
search group. Although the poli-
tical side of Western Pennsylva-
nia's history will not be neglected,
the social and economic aspects
are expected to be stressed.

Must Locate Material.

The ﬁrst task of the group,
stated Dr. Buck, will be to locate
the available material for the sur-
vey. This will consist in the main
of manuscript material, unpub-
lished letters, diaries, journals, rec-
ords of business houses, public
archives, newspaper and magazine
archives, and books and pamphlets.
Much of this material is located
outside the section being investi-

gated, including that in the Burton
historical collection in Detroit, the
Clements Library at the University
of Michigan, and scattered material
at the Library of Congress and at
libraries at Ottawa, Canada, and in
England and France. Mr. Field
will probably be commissioned to
locate available material through-
out Pennsylvania, while Dr. James,
who has been given a leave of ab-
sence for the purpose, will sail in
the fall for Europe, where he will
investigate reference material in
France and England.

Although the present total ap-
propriation will ﬁnance the group
through only the ﬁrst ﬁve years

‘of the Survey, Dr. Buck hopes that

ﬁnancial assistance after that time
will result from endowments and
increased membership of the So-
ciety, making the research a per-
manent activity of the Society.

Dr. Buck also expects to compile
as soon as feasible a bibliography
of reference material bearing on
the history of this section.

To Revamp Society.

As Director of the Historical So-
ciety, Dr. Buck intends to reorgan-
ize the_Society and to promote a
greater interest in the history of
Western Pennsylvania, mainly
through the frequent publ_ication of
historical pamphlets and bulletins,
for use of both the layman and
scholar, and through expeditions
to points of interest in this section.
As a result of the increase in “his-
torical mindedness,” the member-
ship of the Society is expected to
greatly expand from its present
status of between 800 and 900.

Dr. Buck’s 17 years’ service as
superintendent of the Minnesota
Historical Society, during which
time that organization's member-
ship increased almost ﬁvefold and
its collection of historical manu-
scripts increased at least ten times,
largely through his personal efforts,-
well qualiﬁes him for the position
which he now holds. He also
launched, in 1915, the Minnesota
History Bulletin, which was recent-
ly characterized by Dr. Evarts B.
Greene, past president of the Amer-
ican Historical Association, as “one
of the best magazines of its kind

Greeks Cooperate

 

'1‘ IS SOMETHING of a spec-

~ taclo to witness fraternity
‘men working together on a
project no matter what their
pin of allegiance may happen to
be. This bit of Utopia, how-
ever, is to be realized at Pitt

. this week-end when all campus
fraternities will join in an in-
terfraternity conference.

United for the purpose of
learning ways and means to
promote the whole fraternity

- idea, the representatives to the
conference will not confine
their considerations merely to

.b;-cad generalities, but will
discuss many specific and vital
aspects of fraternity life.

It is not often one reads of
such cooperation on the part of
rival fraternities. It speaks well
for the caliber of P_itt -fraternity
men and -the thoroughness un-
der which fraternities are su-
pervised by the University ad-

I ministration.

 

To the Defense

 

COLLEGE BOYS are not get-

. ting a chance to flop in
_the administration end of the
motion picture business. The
reason is that they can't even
qualify a's apprentices.

Of 600 -boys with diplomas
interviewed by one major film
company during the past three
years, all but 16 were turned
down after the first prelimin-
ary. Of the 16 only nine still
hold their jobs. The highest
paid is getting about 8120 a.
week. ,

This particular picture ﬁrm
finds that the average college

I man who has completed his

. course has little more than a
disciplined brain. This com-
-pany thinks that college men
have a flat personality, lack ag-
gressiveness, have no perspec-

O tive and are unable to think
outside of a text book.

That is‘ a pretty scorching
criticism for the average col-
lege man to take without strik-
ing back. It implies? that the
young man who leaves school
with a diploma under his arm
might just as well -buy himself
a pick and shovel. In the opin-
ion of the movie moguls appar-
ently a college education is
only detrimental to a student’s
innate intelligence.

On the other side of the
ledger is the result of a recent
survey conducted by Haver-
ford College, based on that
much-mooted point of whether
or not a college education is a
reliable recipe for sucess in
life. Three-fourths of the liv-
ing alumni of this institution
reported that they have re-
mained in the same type of bus-
iness or profession since leav-
ing college, and 40 per cent of
those in business held execu-
tive positions.

Certainly, these two exam-
ples represent two extremes.
Perhaps one should attempt to
strike a median, but even so
it is more than a little sus-
pected that the clarioned an-
nouncement issued by the pic-
ture corporation was made
with an eye on front page pub-
licity. It is almost a insult to
the entire collegiate brother-
hood.

 

Get the Paddle

TUDENT RELATIONS '

committee has taken ‘a.
step which would seem to put
it in line for congratulations.
Discouraged in its attempts to
persuade the freshman to wear
dinks and black tie. because
of an intangible sense of loy-
alty which was expected to
blossom within him, the com-
mittee has once more dusted
off the paddle and shaved it
down preparatory to usage.

_Soon the freshman male will
perhaps ﬁnd himself wending
his way up campus steps with
the fear of ksiophomores in his
heart.

This is the most satisfactory
arrangement. There is no par-
ticular reason for freshmen to
show any allegiance to regula-
tions when upperclassman in-‘
difference remains undisturb-
ed. Regulations. as long was
they are no more severe than
those placed on Pitt Freshmen,
are good and wholesome. They '
make for class spirit and a
stronger alumni loyalty.

Although the committee
seems a bit hazy when it comes
-to explaining what penalties"
may be imposed on recalcitrant
frosh, it is presumed that ade-
quate measures will be taken.
It is certainly heartening to
know that the committee has
changed its policy after three
years of theorizing and futile
stretching for the Utopia.

Kelly; ormulates Plans
For Campus Welfare Drive

 

Under the direction of (Harrison
 Kelly, Col. '32. general chair-
man of the campus drive in the
campaign of the Federated Welfare

Organizations of Pittsburgh, first
plans for the concerted movement
which opens November 9 were
formulated this week.

Kelly has divided the under-
graduate body of the University
into three sections in his effort to
assure contact with every student.
The first of these includes the
professional schools of Medicine,
Dentistry, Law and Pharmacy and
the entire downtown division.

His second section includes all
fraternities, sororities, clubs, social
Vgroupswand the Oakland rooming

Engineering, Mihes
Faculties Enlarged

Because of an increased enroll-
ment iii the schools of enslneering
land mines, several additions to the

(faculties of these schools have
been announced.

Dr. G. R. Fltterer, who graduated
from the Rose Polytechnic Insti-
tute in 1924 and received his Ph. D.
here, has been engaged as ‘a lec-
turer on the manufacture of steel.

Linn Helander. new assistant
professor. of mechanical engineer-
ing, is a graduate of the University
of Illinois. He has had twelve
years’ experience in the design and
erection of power plants and power
plant machinery.

Thr newly appointed instruc-
tors are: Dr. M. J. Stutzman, who
will teach metallurgy after eight
years’ research experience in gen-
eral metallurgy and the heat treat-
ment of metals; Andrew C. Havens,
local graduate, will instruct in
civil engineering, and Bert V.
Hoardof the University of Wash-
ington, who has had five -years’
experience with the Westinghouse
Electrical and Manufacturing Com-
pany, will instruct in electrical
engineering. .

Three graduate assistants have
been appointed. In the depart-
ment of chemical engineering, Paul
C. Helmbold, a Pitt graduate, and
A. L. Pope of Alabama and Game-
gle Tech havebeen named. H. S.
Gibbs, Pitt. graduate, will be grad-
uate assistant in the department of
all and gas production. - = ‘

houses. In the third and last group
all non-fraternity and npn-sorority
students in the campus schools of
the «College, Business Administra-
tion, Engineering and Education,
who would not be reached in the
other sections, will be appealed to
for contributions to -the general
fund.

Kelly probably will have deﬁnite-
ly selected his team captai and
sub-committee chairmen b the
early part of next week. A full-
time stenographer will be at work
Monday in the office formerly oc-
cupied by the director of student
employment, in the Activities
Building, and this - ‘will’ remain

campaign headquarters until the

completion of the drive.

Fiction Books Included
In Library Additions
A representative list of the

many new books, recently added
to the University Library and now

 

available for student use, include’

the following: "The Letters of
John Keats," “Business Forcast-
ing," by L. H. Haney; "A Short
History of Atomism,” by J. C.
Gregory; "Deportation, of Aliens
from the United States to Europe,"
by J. P. Clark, and "English Edu-
cation 1789 to 1902," by J. W. Ad-
amson.

The best of the latest fiction
books include: “The Road Back,"
by E. M. Remarque, author of “All
Quiet on the Western Front," and
“Seed," by C. G. Norris.

Additional books were also
placed in the Downtown Division
of the University.

Women Urged to Check
On Activities\Points

All women who are accepting of-
ﬂces in campus organizations or
who are signing up to work on com-
mittees this semester are request-
ed to see Miss Rush before doing
so to check up on their activities
points. .

The importance of keeping ac-
tivities points down to the maxi-
mum _ten has been stressed by
Miss Rush this fall. It checks the
tendency for one woman to cary
more work than she can manage in
justice to herself, and it distributes
the number of jobs among a, wider
circle of women. -

Romberg Likes University 
As “Old Heidelberg”rSetting

By JOHN D. PAUL_Us
'‘I would like to write the oper-
etta ‘Old Heidelberg’ over again
with your University as the locale,"
said Sigmund Romberg, composer

of the musical scores for the oper-
ettas “New Moon" and “East
Wind." “It will be done before
long, to be sure. Your city is a
black, loud symphony of steel.
Translated into notes it would
make a powerful opera. And un-
derneath, the “planissimo” of
throbbing life—-of real artistic ap-
preciation. Perhaps that's why
thirty-ﬁve percent of our audiences
are composed of college students.
They are encouraged to appreciate
good music, and I believe they do.”

T

 

reserve the screen version of Vina
Delmar's “Bad Girl" which we saw
at the Fulton last week. There was
an air of perfection about that
movie; when we left the show
there wasn't a thing we wanted
changed. Everything, from Clyde’s
milk-and-ink experiment to ,Sally’s
hysterics, was the right thing in
the right place. We felt from the
beginning that we were seeing the
-impossiblef realism that does not
violate the core of reality. For a
long time we have been searching
for the unromantic garbage can
(which article has, for some ten
years now, been wearing the mysti-
fying halo snatched away from the
moonlight and the roses). And
here we came upon it with a de-
lightful shock. In “Bad Girl” tene-
ment houses aren’t black and crim-
son haunts of sin, salesgirls, broad-.
way failures, and washlines of ex-
pensive underwear. They're mere-
ly tenement houses, real and un-
camouﬂaged with the new ro-
manticism of squalor.
I Q I

There aren't any great ac-
tors in “Bad Girl." Sally Eilers
couldn’t be confused with Gar-
bo, and young Dunn shouldn’t
be trusted with an Ibsen. But
they were both so apt, so well
cast, that we never felt any
quality of genius lacking. They
served the average purpose to
which they were cast with an
amazing perfection. Reality
was with them everywhere. "

_ They kissed, walked, cried,
stood up, sat down, always in
the shadow of reality. The
scenes were handled with the
same faithfulness, and the cos-
tumes were so suitable and fa-
miliar that we fancied that all
the department store girls
whom we know had lent rem-
nants of their wardrobes to
Sally Eilers. As to the inevit-

, able beads which she were»-
we saw their brothers zall sum-
mer in the ilve-and-ten-cent
store. In the last analysis
somebody might consign Vina
Delmar to .a romantic ash
heap. But Eilers and Dunn
are safe——at least so far as we
are concerned.

Musically, we ascend to a more
airy rostrum to discuss things a
bit more finely spun. We tuned in
on WWSW on Sunday and heard
Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms,
which is, by the way, not a sym-
phony at all in the usual ‘sense, but

It is 2 o'clock in the morning.

New Jersey, on the highway 16841’

are seated on the grass between
two graves. They are on their way
home from a camping trip and on
this, the only vacant spot in the
neighborhood, are preparing to
spend the night.

Suddenly the boys notice that
two points of light are approaching

Has Try Outs

Only Upper Class Women
Permitted To Try Out

 

Try-outs for this year's women’s
debating squad will be held at 220
Alumni next Tuesday afternoon at
2:30. Upperclasswomen only can
try out by giving a ﬁve-minute
speech on any of the three follow-
ing subjects: “The government
should control forces of produc-
tion in the United States." “The
nations of the world should adopt
a policy of free trade,” or “Polit-
ical progress demands a formation
of a third party."

Members of last year's team will
not try out. Any upporclasswomen
are urged to ‘take advantage of
this oportunity to make the active
squad.

women debaters last week tenta-
tive plans were mado for this
year's program. The first debate
will be an extension debate at

debating, and Genevieve Blatt,

Letters

To the Editor of Pitt Weekly:
Since the abolition of the
literary, publication,’ "Stone,"
the students of the University
have felt keenly the lack of a
suitable medium of expression
for their work in prose and
poetry. I feel that there are
sufficient followers and lovers
of serious literary work in Pitt
to warrant the support of 8

magazine of this type.

LaJoie Miller,

215 Home Ave., Avalon.

 

To Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

I have often wondered why
the colleges all over the coun-
try pay so much attention to
getting their freshmen accli-
mated and helping them out
by getting them “Big Sisters."
There are lots of others in the
school who need that kind of
help more. There are, for in-
stance, the “Transfers” who
feel more out of place ‘than
any “cock-sure" Fresh. The
only help theyget is a Mentor;
who, nine times out ‘of, ten,
has more 7 girls to show" around
than she could possibly do jus-
tice to.

I would suggest: that .3
“Transfer Week” be installed
‘at Pitt, where representatives
of all the sororities and activi-
ties are present to explain the
social end here.

Speaking of music, we pause

ised to us by the P. M. I.-—-a
series of lectures on the Sym-
phony, given by Charles N.
Boyd and illustrated by Dall-
meyer Russel and Marion
Clark Bollinger at two pianos.
We have always beenfamong
the devotees that attend these
lectures. We like to listen. to
Mr. Boyd; he approaches and
develops his subjects with a
scholar's air and a rare grave
wit. We believe Mr. Russel to
be by far Pittsburgh's finest ’
pianist—-always exact, always
crisp, always completely_faith-
ful to the letter and the spirit
of the composer-and Marion
Clark Bollinger makes a
worthy partner. We will have
six symphonies: The. Brahms
C minor and F major, Schu-
bert’s C major, Franck’s D
minor, and Dvorak's New
World. We're going, of course.
Although, we know the sym-
phonies -well enough in the or-
chestral version. the piano
brings into light and clarity
