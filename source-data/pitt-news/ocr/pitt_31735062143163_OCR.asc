l Fesler Forsakes Pitt

To Coach , O..S.U. Eleven

A search for alnew football coach to lead the Panthers through
their suicidal 1947‘ schedule loomed ‘as a distinct probability today
as rumors mounted that Wes ‘Fesler, after one season as chief ‘men-

tor of the Blue and Gold eleven, would sign a contract as head

coach at Ohio State university.

Fesler, the personable young All-American who showed promise
of elevating Pitt’s football fortunes from the doldrums of the_ post-
Sutherland period, was sigried.to¢’

"a contract at Pitt containing an
oral ‘agreement to’ remain for
three years unless a better offer
~ clelevoped in 'that_time._

Rumors that Fesler had accept-
T ed the post of head gridiron pro-
fessor for the ‘Buckeyes were pre-

, cipitated S a t - .

Larkins, in commenting on the

ceed Andy Kerr as'head.eoach at
Colgate‘ university, said, “Fesler
is our (irst, and, so far, our only
choice.”

Announcement Expected Soon

Announcement qt’ Fesler’s ap-
pointment is expected simultane-
ously from Columbus and Pitts-
burgh probably late today.

Mike. Milligan, line coach in
the current Fesler dynasty and
former Pittfootballer, probably
will be named to’ replace Fesler
for the coming season with Dick

Employers Must Verify

“Most employed veterans claim-
ing subsistence, however, will be
required to secure verification
from their employer of the ex-
tent of their earnings,” Mr. Ric-
art said. “This does not apply to
those not eligible for ‘subsistence,
those entering Pitt for the ﬁrst

period of interruption.”

When the forms are filled out,
they should be returned to the

side that room~ has been provid-
ed for thoseiwho return‘ the forms
after office hours.

Failure to report within the

Mr. Ricart'also stressed the im-

Swooping towards a limb that’s

months, the 1946 Owl let out a

its nest on ‘the 8th floor.

“Fire Power” 1
Gets Off Press;
Beats Schedule

The ﬁrst edition of “Fire Pow-
er”, official veterans’ newspaper
on campus, was mailed to mem-
bers of the Veterans’ association
Friday, Feb. 7, instead of Feb. 10,
as was ﬁrst announced.

Earl Kelley, serving as editor,
announced that the ﬁrst edition
is made up of four pages, 9 by 12
inches in size. It includes fea-
tures, cartoons, and cuts perti-
nent to vets’ interests on campus.

The purpose of the newspaper
is to keep the veterans in closer
contact with their organizations.
“It is to act as a medium between
the leadership and the member-
ship of the association,” according
to Jack Grimes, president of the
Veterans’ association.

The publishing of ‘a newspaper
of their own is not a result of the
recent c-lash over vets in activi-
ties; nor is it a “rabble-rousing
rag.” The newspaper will not be
anti anything. It is pro-student,
pro—university, and pro-vet.

The next issue of the newspa-
per will be published in a month.

Working with Earl Kelley on
the ﬁrst edition were John Go-
lightly, Sam Goldworth, Tom

Perkinson, Bob Page, Tony, Glass-

er, Bernard Fischman,
Giesey, and Sam Hobbs. .

Business Manager A1 Dahl-
gren announced that the newspa-
per will be ﬁnanced by the treas-
ury of the Veterans’ association.
The University Publications board
has ruled that there will be no
advertising in the veterans’ pa-
per.

The bulk of Howard Waite’:
Panther swim squad has been
working out daily during the mid-
semester Vacation at Trees Gym
pool in preparation for, their
forthcoming meetwith Edinboro
Teachers on Feb. '15.

Many of the others, before go- '

ing home for the recess period,
reported to Coach Waite that they
expected to continue workouts in
their home pools.‘ ’

The match with Edinboro,
which will be staged at Trees
pool, is a repeat engagement for
the two schools. In the previous
meet the Blue and Gold merman
copped the decision.

In their only other meet this
winter, the Pitt swimmers drop-
ped a decision to the crack Slip-
pery Rock squad. The Rockets
also own a win over Edinboro.

Waite reports that Don‘ Wilde
has been improving in the sprints
while Mike Levine has been mas-
tering the 220 and 440—yard trials
in great form. The general out-
look for a repeat victory over
Edinboro appears to be good.
