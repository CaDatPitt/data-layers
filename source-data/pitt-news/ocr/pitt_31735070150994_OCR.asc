Pitt athletic director Steve Ped-
erson entered his 13th year in
charge of Pitt Athletics in 2013.

' Now, with a ﬁve—year contract ex-

tension, Pederson’s tenure as the
10th athletic director in Panther
history will run through 2018. _

Chancellor Mark A. Norden-
berg announced the five-year
contract in a press release this
morning.

“With the University of Pitts-
burgh set to ofﬁcially join the At-
lantic Coast Conference onjuly 1,
our athletic programs never have
been better positioned for future
success,” Nordenberg said. “That
is a real tribute to the hard work

and effective leadership provided

by Steve Pederson as Pitt’s athletic
director.”

Pederson’s work was also rec-
ognized by ACC commissioner
John Swofford, who cited the role
Pederson has played at Pitt and in
the conference.

“Pitt has a terriﬁc asset and
leader in Steve Pederson. He’s
one of the most experienced and
respected athletics directors in the
country, and he’s already made a
positive and prominent impact
around the ACC table,” Swofford
said.

Pederson is currently in his
second tenure as Pitt’s athletic di-
rector, with his ﬁrst coming from
1996-2002. Pederson’s actions to
de-emphasize “Pitt” in the school’s
logo in favor of “Pittsburgh,” along
with his changes to the school’s

Keepyour friends close and mutual friends private

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

Some people live by the motto,
“An enemy of my enemy is my
friend.” But a recent Pitt study re-
garding mutual friends on Face-
book could potentially challenge
this time-tested mantra, making
Facebook friends and friends of
Facebook friends enemies—or
snoops, at the very least.

James Joshi, an associate pro-
fessor at Pitt’s School of Infor-
mation Sciences, led the study,
which was published April 22
in the journal “Computers and
Security.” The researchers ran
simulations of various ways that
one user could attempt to learn

another user’s friends or neigh-
bors linked by two degrees of
separation to a user.

“Our focus here is to see how
the mutual friend feature can
be used to find out who are.pos—
sible friends or are at 2 or 3 [de-
grees of separation] away from
a targeted user,” Joshi said in
an email. “Once an attacker can
build these links for the targeted
user, he may be able to utilize
those techniques to infer some
private information about the
targeted user.

Mohd Anwar, a former profes-
sor at the School of Information
Sciences who is now a professor
at North Carolina AT&T State
University, and Leijin, a Ph.D.

3. :4‘,

candidate at the School of Infor-

mation Sciences, also served on

the research team.

The researchers pointed out that
users on social media can often
keep their proﬁles private and
block their friend lists. But their
mutual friend lists on networking
sites remain public.

In order to test how many of a us-
er’s private friends an “attacker”
— whichjoshi defined as anyone
who seeks private information
about another user on a social
network — could identify, the
researchers used a simulated so-
cial network.

The researchers used a data set
of 63,731 users taken in late 2008
and early 2009 from the New

Orleans regional network. Joshi
said that the data set, from which
names and other identifying in-
formation were removed, is pub-
licly available for researchers.

Within this simulated network,
the Pitt researchers ran simula-
tions of different types of “at—
tacks” in which one user tried
to discover the privately listed
friends of a user. The attackers
simulated attacks between us-
ers who were grouped together
randomly. They also simulated

attackers by narrowing down .

Board of Trustees approves
student fee conversion A

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s Board ofTrustees approved a reso-
lution Wednesday that will convert the
Student Health Fee to the Wellness Fee,
coinciding with the broadening scope of
services offered through the University’s
Healthy U Program.

The resolution will change the name
and use of the fee, which will now cover all
programs associated with the Healthy U
program such as Student Health Services,
the Counseling Center and the Depart-
ment oflntramurals and Recreation.

Healthy U is a collaborative effort by
pre—exi_sting programs at Pitt to promote
physical, mental and social well—being.

All three programs will combine and
relocate to Nordenberg Hall, Pitt’s newest
freshman dormitory that is scheduled to

open in theefall semester.

According to Pitt’s Department of Stu-
dent Affairs website, all undergraduate,
graduate and professional students pay
a mandatory $85 fee each semester to
cover services offered through the Stu-
dent Health Services. It strives to provide
“high quality prevention, health educa-
tion, primary healthcare and pharmacy”
services. Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
in an email that the fee will not increase
this year despite the addition of the two
new programs.

Fedele also said that before the pas-
sage of the resolution, the Student Health
Fee covered programs offered through
Student Health Services and a portion of

-the Counseling Center’s budget. Appro-
priations to the Department of Intramu-
rals and Recreation were contained with-
in the Office of Student Affairs budget.

their profile. \

The researchers referred to this group of
users as an implicit group. For instance,
anyone who listed University of Pittsburgh
as his or her educational institution would
belong to the same implicit group.

The researchers found that in simulated
attacks during which an attacker tried to
identify the friends of a target by query-
ing for mutual friends between the target
and other users within the same implicit
group, the attacker could identify an aver-
age of 64 percent of a target’s friends in
an implicit group of about 500 users and
an average of more than 76 percent of a
user’s friends using an implicit group of
more than 1,200 users.

The researchers also simulated attacks in
which an attacker used multiple accounts
in order to increase the likelihood that he
or she could also have more friends with
connections to the target.

When the researchers simulated attacks
with 100 such compromised accounts,

 

Social networking sites allow strangers to draw links between users through friend

they found that the attacker could identify
an average of 95 percent of the target’s
friends. In these attacks, they could iden-
tify 67 percent of a target’s “two—distant”
and “three-distant neighbors,” or those
linked to the target by two or three degrees
of separation.

The researchers said that identifying a
user’s friends can allow others to make
inferences about the user.

“When an attacker ﬁnds that many of the
user’s mutual friends are interested in jog-
ging, the attacker can infer that the user’s
interests, which are not public, most likely
include jogging,” the researchers wrote in
their article.

While it might not sound like a serious
compromise of a user’s privacy for some-
one to learn that he or she is interested
in jogging, the researchers also pointed
out that what users consider important
is highly subjective.

Users might also want to keep certain
friends private. For instance, on the ca-

reer—oriented networking site Linkedln, a
user might not want to let others see that
he or she is friends with an individual who
has a bad reputation.

Facebook spokesman Frederic Wolens
declined to comment on the researchers’
suggestion that the mutual-friend feature
on Facebook and other sites could com-
promise users’ privacy.

Linkedln did not respond to a request for
comment. .

As one serious consequence of violations
to users’ privacy, the researchers referred
to “profile cloning,” in which an individual
uses another user’s private information to
make a proﬁle that appears “more authen-
tic than the true identity.”

Over email,]oshi said such cases have not
been common so far. But there is reason
for concern about them.

In order to illustrate his point, Joshi said
that a spy allegedly working on behalf
of the Chinese government set up a fake
account on Facebook for a retired U.S.
admiral who was serving as a senior NATO
commander last year.

It was not until after senior British military
and government ofﬁcials added the fake
proﬁle as a friend, granting the alleged
spy contact and other private information,
that the ruse was discovered. ‘

. The Chinese embassy in’Washington, D.C.,
did not respond to a request for comment
on the truth of these allegations.

Wolens said that Facebook takes measures
to prevent such proﬁle cloning.

“It’s a violation of our policies to use a
fake name or operate under a false iden-
tity, and we encourage people to report
anyone they think is doing this,” Wolens
said in an email.

He added that Facebook users can report
other users who maintain false identities
on the site, both through. links and through
forms provided on the site.

Joshi pointed out that some things about
social networking systems have changed
in the roughly ﬁve years since his data set
was collected.

“The average connectivity has likely in-
creased significantly and hence more
number of friends and neighbors may be
discovered,” he said in an email.

In the ofﬂine data set the researchers used,
the average user had 25 friends. In the

researchers’ journal article, they cited a.

study published in 2011 that said the aver-
age Facebook user has 190 friends.

Joshi pointed out that Facebook and other
sites also allow users to limit which friends
can view their lists of friends and said he
would encourage students to pay careful
attention’ to their privacy settings and
exercise caution regarding the friends who
they accept.

“I think Facebook and other [social net-
working systems] have tremendous social
values and that these results should not de-
ter students from using them,” he said over
email. “Rather I would say we all should
be aware that there are potential privacy
risks while using them and use caution.”

OFFICER  

representing Kercher in the case, said that
his client will enter a plea of “not guilty.”

He added that Kercher’s son told the
detectives who ﬁled the complaint that
his father made a mark on his neck, but,
when the boy took the stand last week, he
said the mark came from wrestling with
his father.

“They were horsing around,” Difender-
fer said. “They were having fun.”

Difenderfer also said that if Kercher
had put a knife in his son’s mouth, it would
have left cuts or other marks, but there are

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said that
Kercher joined the Pitt police department

DOCTOR SUSS

Brutalism and the Obama administration:
how both lost touch with people

Stephen Suss
F or The Pitt News

Gray, massive and utilitarian,
Wesley W. Posvar Hall rests awk-
wardly on Pitt’s campus. Fac-
ing the neo—gothic arches of the
Cathedral of Learning and the
ornate fountain at the entrance
of the villa-inspired Frick Fine
Arts Building, Posvar’s structure
seems plain and uninspired in
comparison. Posvar’s design and
architecture reflects a time when
both architects and politicians
thought they could reshape hu-
manity. Yet, the dysfunctional
state of Posvar stands as a tes-
tament to this failed attitude. It
seems, though, that the Obama
administration has been slow to
drop a similar ideal.

The first time I entered
Posvar Hall, I thought I had
mistakenly entered an airport
terminal. Surrounded by high
concrete walls, I faced a broad

hallway containing only a hand-
ful of oddly shaped tables and
chairs scattered down its length.
Underneath a series of forbid-
ding escalators in the distance
was a small lobby consisting of
nothing more than a cluster of
disorganized and uncomfortable
chairs.

Others who have had the mis-
fortune of venturing through
Posvar’s labyrinth can tell you
that it’s no easy place to navi-
gate. “From the time I enter
[Posvar] until the time I reach
my destination, it takes me five
minutes — that’s a long time,”
says Joe Killian, a senior archi-
tecture student at Pitt. He agrees
that Posvar’s flaws are a result
of being built on antiquated
theory: brutalism.

Brutalism is a substyle of
modern architecture popular
from the ‘SOS to mid ‘70s. Char-
acteristically cold and fortress-
like, Brutalist architecture was
meant to bend human nature

to ﬁt the perfect social models
envisioned by its designers. Le
Corbusier, a famous architect
and proponent of Brutalism dur-
ing his time, once had plans to
level Paris and replace its build-
ings with a series of large con-
crete skyscrapers, which he be-
lieved could transform the city
into a utopia. ,

Many people are undoubtedly
glad that Corbusier’s plans never
came tofruition, but one must
understand that his motivations
were inﬂuenced by a time period
in which many people sought to
create a better society. One trip
through Posvar, though, and I
can’t be sure how the architects
were trying to accomplish this.

When I look at the Obama
administration, I experience a
similar level of confusion. What I
witness is an administration that
seemed to start with good inten-
tions and an inspiring rhetoric

provided to support the claim that the
administration authorized targeting con-
servative groups’ tax records for review

,with additional scrutiny. It seems the

Obama administration has developed
a “white knight” attitude, its members
seeing themselvesgallantly defending
the nation from radical conservatives.
Ironically, through these scandals and
secrecy, the administration has demon-
strated how ignoble and authoritative it
actually is. ’ .

So, would the conservatives do better
in office? Highly unlikely. When consid-
ering their record —‘— Watergate under
former President Richard Nixon and the
Iran Contra under former President Ron-
ald Reagan —— it’s clearthatpconservatives

are capable of being just as aggressive

and insidiously ‘noble in their attempts
to change otherénatigons and American
society as liberals.  1 S S

left Iraq, a nation we continually tried to
shape into the democracy it never asked
to be, our policy toward dictatorships in
the Middle East hasn’t changed much.

We even considered intervening in Egypt V

when the country elected a leader whom
our administration considered a threat
to its political interest.

Considering the U.S. provided $60

billion to Egypt over the 30 years be-
fore former President Hosni Mubarak’s

downfall, it’s clear that, for the Obama,

administration, control of Egypt was
more important than the country attain-
ing democracy. But this should not be
surprising, considering the U.S. tradi-
tion of supporting unpopular dictators in
order to shape other countries. In fact,
we still provide aid to the dictatorships
of Jordan and Turkmenistan.

Aside from continued attempts to.
manage nations overseas, the Obama
administration has also carried on an-
other tradition bolstered by the Bush
administration: venturing into murky
areas of privacy and, without the public’s
knowledge, taking it a step further, at-
tempting to bend its opposition to its will.

Take, for instance, the recent IRS’

sponded, “No, human nature is inherent,

‘[but] it is a true art when an architect is
able to capture several positive outlets V

for human nature.” Killian couldn’t be
more right. _V

Where we should see our government
loo-king forthe best altruist outlets for
humanity, we instead see a manhandling
of the American people. _

The issue we face today is an adminis-
tration that feels that it’s above its con-
stituents. We’ve shifted from a govern-
ment of the people, to a government that

V tells people what’s best for them.

Posvar, and its authoritarian aesthet-
ics, is a reminder of a generation of ar-
chitects who believed they were better
than society and could subtly change its
nature. Obama’s administration is not
different. With all of the elegance the first
family has taken on, it seems they’ve lost
touch with the American people. We need
to get our hands out of other countries,
regain U.S. citizens’ privacy and start

i relating to the people again.

The Obama administration seems in-

- terested in none of these things. Instead,
. it’s just become an authoritarian and con-
_ servative regime posing as progressive.

Despite Friday evening’s overcast sky and
unseasonably cool breeze, Edward Sharpe and
the Magnetic Zeros managed to lift, spirits at
the Three Rivers Arts Festival with their intoxi-
cating, yet adorably cheesy, sing—along lyrics.

The 10-person band’s free concert at-
tracted a large and diverse crowd to Point
State Park, and it was hard to traverse the
ﬁeld of listeners without bumping into a col-
lege hipster or parents with babies on their
shoulders.

Regardless of whom listeners found them-
selves surrounded by, the band’s folky tunes
had everyone swaying and bobbing heads in
a sea of placid enjoyment.

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros
seemed to have a sound more ﬁtting for a
live performance than a recording studio, as
the band’s stage presence made the versions
of their songs on your iPod sound insipid by
comparison.

Though the crowd begged for the hits,

lead singers Alex Ebert and Jade Castrinos
reassured fans that the band would get to
those songs eventually and encouraged them
to sing along to the songs they played in the
meantime. ‘

Their persuasion worked, and almost ev-
ery song featured backup vocals from hun-
dreds of attendees.

The set’s ﬁnale was a heartfelt rendition of
“Home,” the breakout single that catapulted

the band to indie—folk notoriety.

Before the ﬁnal bridge of “Home,” the song
that features Ebert and Castrinos recounting
their memories as lovers ﬁnally expressing
their feelings to one another, the band stopped
its instruments and allowed fans to tell some
stories of their own, which ranged from one
fan fawning over Castrinos to another reciting
a short poem.

the 2004 film “Before Sunset.” The two
reignited the relationship’s smoldering
flame almost instantly, allowing Jesse’s
failing marriage stateside to seem like
nothing more than a bad dream — ex-

Davey—Fitzpatrick).

Ten years and two twin daughters
later, Celine and Jesse face reality’s ver-

with alarming finality over the rolling

time.

In the movie’s opening airport scene,
Jesse sees Hank off and, even though
they’re on screen together forjust a few
minutes, Hawke and Davey—Fitzpatrick
share an authentically deflated goodbye.
It’s clear that this is not the first or last
time they’ve parted ways for a duration
of time, and the separation clearly wears
on Jesse. His vacant stares throughout
the car ride back and parts of the day
highlight just how far from home Jesse
feels when Hank’s away.

Jesse suggests, with no small amount
of subtlety, that maybe they might want
to think about moving back to the states
one day. At a time when Celine aspires for
an important position in government and
the couple’s twin girls seem surprisingly
entrenched in the European culture --
they’re the only two who don’t speak a
word of English throughout the course of
the movie —— Jesse’s timing isn’t ideal. To
Celine, the thought of leaving everything
she knows behind because ofJesse’s vin-

_ dictive ex’s hold on Hank is unbearable.

— their conversations wind, bend, climb
and fall like the cobblestone path lining
the Greek countryside and city streets.
It’s clear their relationship has taken
some similar turns over the years.

Like the first two movies, the real sub-
stance of“Before Midnight” comes from
the two leads’ dialogue as they muse to-
gether, forcing small questions to evolve
into larger themes. In the previous films,
however, any disagreements about en-
vironmental policy or the polite way to
order coffee would quickly fizzle as they
once again got lost in each other’s eyes.
This is not the case anymore. Now, small
facial ticks turn to small questions, then
disagreements, then arguments and then

full—blown ﬁghts. What does Jesse re-tr

ally mean every time he mentions “back
home?” Is he trying to keep her from
taking her dreamjob? Are the twins the
only thing keeping him here? Do his eyes
wander too much for his own good? And
what about that cute female publicist he
was on the roadwith when his phone
conveniently died? S

PREVIEW

Pittsburgh Pride testament to city’s supportive LGBT culture

Vincent Smith
Staff Wrz'ter

In the past, Pittsburgh, like many other cities,
did not accommodate the LGBT community,
let alone accept its members as equals because
society considered homosexuality to be taboo.

But this upcomingweekend, Pittsburgh resi-
dents can witness how far the LGBT movement
has progressed when Pittsburgh Pride begins
June 14.

Pittsburgh Pride, put together by the Delta
Foundation, an interest group dedicated to
furthering “awareness and understanding of
the LGBT community,” will feature three days
of festivities. The events include a bar crawl
Friday, the Pride March through the streets
at noon Sunday and a concert Saturday night

.5. featuring former American Idol phenomenon

Adam Lambert on Liberty Ave. All of the events
conclude with PrideFest that same day.

“I think [the Delta Foundation] is most
proud of the number of corporations and or-
ganizations that we have been able to bring
together at the same time, at one event,” said
Chris Bryan, the director of marketing and de-
velopment for the Delta Foundation.

The notable sponsors include American
Eagle Outﬁtters and Coors‘ Light, aswell as
local sponsors such as UPMC, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette and the Office of the Mayor of

Pittsburgh.

Brandon Benjamin, president of Pitt’s Rain-
bow Alliance, said he attended his ﬁrst Pitts-
burgh Pride the summer after his freshman year
and was instantly enraptured by the festivities.

“Something that was really cool for me,
coming from a small town, was seeing that
there are parts of the world that are‘ abso-
lutely gung ho about the LGBTQ community.”
Benjamin fondly remembers his experiences
in the Pride March, a congregation of many
different groups who support the LGBT move-
ment parading down the streets of Pittsburgh
as spectators cheer them on.

“We marched in front of a group called
the Flaggots last year,” he said, laughingly, in
reference to an Ohio—based color guard en-
semble that performed roudnes while members,
marched.

Like Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, Pittsburgh’s
Gay and Lesbian Community Center will also
take part in the Pride March, and the group
plans to have a table with information at Pride-
Fest. The GLCC has operated for more than 30
years and offers members of the community
—— primarily those under the age of 25 —— a safe
haven in an urban environment.

“[The Gay and Lesbian Community Center]
is very excited because this is the largest LGBT
event in the city of Pittsburgh for the entire
year,” said Lyndsey Sickler, the center’s»d_irector.

But what Pittsburgh Pride also highlights is

how behind Pennsylvania is in terms of equality
for people of all sexual orientation.

“It is generally accepted that outside of Pitts-
burgh and Philadelphia, most of [the state] is
not very progressive on the LGBT issue,” Ben-

jamin said.

With Supreme Court decisions on both Prop-
osition 8 and DOMA on the horizon, the arena
is set for more challenges to the status quo.

“I think [the Pennsylvania LGBT movement]
has come a long way [but] it still has a longway
to go,” said Bryan.

But both Benjamin and Bryan are hopeful
for the future.

Culturally, Benjamin believes that Pittsburgh
is a “very positive place to be,” adding that Pitts-
burgh Pride “represents every facet of the LGBT
culture” with an array of participants ranging
from men in business suits to “shot boys in
booty shorts, rollerblading down Liberty Av-
enue, handing out shots to the people.”

Support for the event has grown over the
years. In2007, the ﬁrst year of Pittsburgh Pride,
the Delta Foundation expected a tumout of
roughly 1,000 people, yet more than 3,000
came insupport of the event. Now, Bryan said,
they are witnessing a 25,000-supporter in-
crease per year. This year she expects more than

S V 150 vendors to take part in PrideFest.

“This [LGBT] community is outland proud
and just wants to be treated like everyone else,”
Bryan said. I

MIDNIGHT

nightfall. The movie does an incredible
job at showing the evolution ofa volcanic
argument between two people undeniably
still in love, no matter how evanescent
that day on the train may seem.

“Before Midnight” is about the real-
world problems associated with love in
the Facebook age, where Skype conversa-
tions with Hank replace games of catch
in the backyard. It’s about gender roles
and status in the family. It’s about the
past’s untiring devotion to clawing away
at the present, the therapeutic escape of
sex and what it can and can’t mend in a
struggling relationship and the potential
problems with being in love with your
muse. It’s about commitment in every
sehse of the word.

Hawke and Delpy helped write the en-
tire trilogy, and their chemistry on screen
surely poured over into their storytelling.
Even if you haven’t seen the ﬁrst two films,
20 minutes into “Before Midnight” brings
you up to speed onjesse and Celine, their
enchanted beginnings and their unsure
future. .

They walk a lot and they talk a lot, but
instead of a jumbled potpourri of heavy
ideas and big problems —— as could have
easily been the case — “Before Midnight”
feels like a gentle mosaic of love. in the
real world with a predictable, but elegant,
portrayal of all its imperfections. I

Martin integral to
Pirates’ success

Dan Sostek
For The Pitt News

Who is the best catcher in baseball?
As I began to cast my 2013 Major
League All-Star Game ballot, I began
to think about the best catcher in the
National League. I scrolled through

. names such as Brian McCann, Buster

Posey and Yadier Molina, and an in-
terestingthought came to mind. Who
is the best catcher in the NL?

Just look over the Allegheny
River to PNC Park, where you will
see a backstop who has helped lead
the resurgence of the Pirates, one of
baseball’s oldest and most storied
franchises: Russell Martin.

While Martin got off to a slow
start this season, going 4—for—39 and
batting .103, he currently bats .246
and ranks fourth among National

‘League catchers in runs created. In

fact, Martin has accounted for nearly

10 percent of all the Pirates’ runs this 2

season.

The offensive success has contrib-
uted to Martin leading all catchers
with a 2.6 wins above replacement
value, a statistic that measures how
many more wins a team has with a
player as opposed to playing with
one who operates at a “replacement
level.” =
. And_while Martin is a good hit-
ter, his greatest value lies behind the
plate:This season, Martin has thrown
out 45 percent of base stealers, the
second—best mark in the National
League. This ﬁlled a dire need in the
Pirates’ clubhouse after would-be
base stealers ran all over Rod Bara-
jas and Michael McKenry last year.

Yadier Molina, who is often re-
garded as the top defensive catcher in
baseball, hasthrownout42 percent of
base stealers, whereas, Buster Posey
has thrown out just 20 percent.

In addition, Martin’s play behind
the plate impacts not just the base-
paths but also his battery mate on
the mound for any given day.

Last season the Buccos ranked
eighth in the National League with a
3.86 earned run average. With Martin
taking control of a similar staff this
season, he has helped the club lower
the total team ERA to just 3.24 and
has led arguably the best bullpen in
baseball.

Nicknamed the “Shark Tank,” the
Pirates’ bullpen features the top-per-
forming closer inbaseball, the major
league leader in saves and one of the ‘

v top setup men in baseball.

A And while Neal Huntington, the
team’s general manager, has done a
fantastic job in acquiringarms such as
Mark Melancon and Francisco Liria— ’
no, the biggest change is in Martin.

Coming off a career—wors_t 6.20
ERA with the Red Sox’s last season,
Melancon hasﬁnally hit his stride.
The right—hander leads the league in
holds and has lowered his ERA by ﬁve
points from last season.

Liriano has also turned his career
around with the help of Martin this
season. Liriano has struck out almost
12 batters per nine innings, while
walking only 3 1/2 batters per nine
innings — the lowest mark Liriano
has put up in three seasons.

While Martin might not receive
the national recognition he deserves,
he is certainly receiving a lot of rec-
ognition from members of the Pitts-
burgh media and his teammates.

On May 16-in the eighth inning of
a2-1 ball game againstthe Milwaukee
Brewers,Martin might have made
the defensive play of the year when
a curveball from setup man Mark
Melacon was swung through byjean
Segura.

The pitch ended up bouncing off
Martin’s shin guard before settling
down in the grass. Martin picked
up the ball and threw an off-balance
blind strike to ﬁrst baseman Gaby
Sanchez, nailing one of the league’s
fastest players in the process.

According to Pirates manager
Clint Hurdle, the play was “as good a
play as I’ve ever seen a catcher make.”
Hurdle further complimented his
catcher when he described Martin’s
playthis season as “out of this world.”

While Molina will most likely
win his sixth—straight Gold Glove
and make the National League All-
Star team as Buster Posey’s backup,
Martin will quietly continue to be an
integral part of a Pirates team that is
chasing the magical 82-win mark,
which would give the team its ﬁrst
winning season since 1992.

So, for the National League’s best
catcher and his ball club, things are
looking good.

Really, really good. I

BASEBALL

Three Pitt baseball players selected in

   
 

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

In last week’s Major League Base-
ball Amateur Entry Draft, three
Pitt players were selected by ma-
jor league teams. Starting pitcher
Ethan Mildren, catcher Elvin Soto
and starter Matt Wotherspoon

were drafted on the third day of ’

selection.

The three players raise the total
number of Panthers drafted under
Pitt head coachjoejordano to 28.

Mildren was the ﬁrst Panther to
come off the board with the 350th
overall pick in the 12th round of
the draft by the Minnesota Twins.
Mildren is the ﬁrst Panther ever
drafted by the organization.

“Ethan has been incredible for
us,”jordano said in a press release.
“Anytime he was on the mound,
we knew we had a chance to win.
He pitches great, has incredible
character on and off the ﬁeld and
deﬁnitely will be a good draft pick.”

Mildren’s 2013 season saw him
selected to the All-Big East ﬁrst
team after he ﬁnished with a 10-3
record in 114 and two-thirds in-

Catcher Elvin Soto was one of three Pitt players selected over the weekend. Huailei Wang | ForThe Pitt News

nings pitched with a 2.35 earned
run average. In his career, Mildren
ﬁnished 20-13 with a 3.16 ERA and
193 strikeouts.

Mildren’s 20 wins on the mound
rank him fourth among all pitchers
in Pitt’s history.

“Ethan deserves everything
coming his way,” jordano said. “I
have no doubts that he’s going to
have a very successful professional
career, and I am conﬁdent that he
will have the opportunity to pitch
in the big leagues.”

His battery mate behind the
plate, Elvin Soto, was the second
player off the board when the Ari-
zona Diamondbacks selected the
sophomore catcher with the 480th
pick in the 16th round.

“Elvin has been waiting for
this day, certainly for the past two
years,”Jordano said. “I believe Elvin
felt that he deserved to be drafted
out of high school, and when that
did not happen, I think he made it
an absolute goal to be drafted after
his sophomore year.”

Soto was another member of
the All-Big East ﬁrst team after he
hit .320 with six home runs and

43 RBI over the course of his 2013
campaign. Soto ﬁnished his career
hitting .284 with 12 home runs and
80 RBI.

Soto is the second Pitt player
drafted by Arizona after the D-
Backs selectedjason Conti in 1960?

Pitt’s ﬁnal draft choice was
Wotherspoon, who was selected
with the 606th overall choice in the
20th round by the Detroit Tigers.
Wotherspoon was named to the All-
Big East second team and went 9-3
with a 3.70 ERA and a team-high 85
strikeouts.

“Matt is an extrememlty hard
worker who has a great passion
for not only the University but our
program who will have an opportu-
nity to play professionally,”_]ordano’
said. “At this stage, I think it’s going
to be up to him to make a decision
on whether to continue his colle-
giate career and pitch in the ACC
or to start his professional career.”

If Wotherspoon opts to sigr:
with the Tigers, he’ll end his ca-
reer at Pitt, ranking sixth in career
strikeouts with 190 punch-outs
alongside a 17-9 record and a 4.29
ERA. I

PEDERSlV

Athletic Director Steve Pederson received a -year contract extension Tuesday. Sarah
Kontos | Serlior Staff Photographer

with the “Pitt script” to navy blue and
Vegas gold with a “torch—cut” logo —— drew
much ire from Pitt’s fanbase.

Other controversial decisions'includ-
ed the demolition of the on—campus Pitt
Stadium and subsequent move to Heinz
Field — roughly ﬁve miles removed from
campus — in order to create space for the
Petersen Events Center and the altera-
tion of the booster c1ub’s name from the
“Golden Panthers” to “Team Pittsburgh.”

In his initial tenure, Pederson hired
men’s basketball head coach Ben How-
land, baseball coach Joe Jordano, track

’ and field coach Alonzo Webb, women’s

basketball coach Traci Waites, volleyball
coach Chris Beerman and Walt Harris
to replace former football coach Johnny
Majors.

Harris guided Pitt to the Liberty Bowl
in 1997, ending an eight-year drought for
the program. Howland set Pitt on track to
become one of the nation’s top basketball
programs.

All of the aforementioned hires re- l

ceivedBig East Coach of the Year honors,
and Pederson won the Gen. Robert R. Ney—
land Award for outstanding administra-

tive achievement as recognized by the l

All-America Football Foundation.
Shortly after receiving the award, Ped-
erson left for Nebraska.

Pederson returned to Pitt in 2007 after T,

a ﬁve-year stint as the athletic director
of Nebraska, his alma mater. Pederson’s
return was prompted by his ﬁring at the
behest of Nebraska chancellor Harvey
Perlman, who cited a lack of football prog-
ress in the move.

The ﬁring came just months after Ped-

erson’s contract was renewed for ﬁve years
at the end ofjuly 2007. It might have been
prompted by what regent Randy Ferlic
called a “lynch mob,” according to an
ESPN report in October by Ivan Maisel,
which stated that Ferlic and other regents
received hundreds of emails calling not
only for Pederson’s ﬁring, but also those of
Perlman and football coach Bill Callahan.

About a month after his ﬁring, Pitt re-
hired Pederson. Since then he has signed
Jeff Long, who hiredjamie Dixon to a 10-
year contract extension that runs through
2023, and moved Pitt from Adidas to Nike
as the school’s equipment and apparel
partner.

Six years after Pederson’s rehiring, Pitt
is on the verge of taking a huge step for-
ward both athletically and academically
as it enters the Atlantic Coast Conference.

“As we begin this exciting new era of
ACC competition, we all have high aspi-
rations for each of our programs. The

. creativity, strength and stability of Steve’s

continued leadership will be an important
asset as we pursue those lofty goals,” Nor-
denberg said.

Pederson himself looks forward to con-
tinuing his tenure at Pitt and moving onto
the challenge of the ACC, as Nordenberg
referenced.

“This is an exciting time to be at the
University of Pittsburgh,” Pederson said.
“I am fortunate to work with this great
staff, and together we are helping to guide
each of our student-athletes as they aspire
to excellence academically, athletically
and personally. I appreciate the conﬁ-
dence the chancellor has in our ability
to keep Pitt athletics moving forward.”
