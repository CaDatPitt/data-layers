Counselors Seek to
Prevent Rape
Through Awareness

Growing Number of
Assaults on College
Campuses Can Be Avoided

By CAROLE LYNN GERLOCK
For The Pitt News

One in eight college women
will be raped before graduation,
according to Pitt’s Counseling
Center.

The number of sexual assault
cases on college campuses is
growing, but counselors at the
center say that these assaults can
be prevented.

One in three womenwill be
sexually assaulted in her lifetime.
Eighty-five percent of college
women will know their attacker.
Every three minutes a woman is
being attacked.

These statistics from Mary
Ruiz, sexual assault services
coordinator at Pitt, sound horrify-
ing, but Ruiz said that the coun-

. seling center has a sexual assault
service to help students in a vari-
ety of ways —- both in preventing
an attack and in overcoming the

physical and emotional effects of ‘

one.

The center offers a prevention
program called’ P.E.E.R.S.
(Educating Peers) or Peer

Educators for an Environment
free of Rape and Sexual exploita-
tion.

P.E.E.R.S. consists of Pitt
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents who volunteer their time to
create awareness of sexual assault
on the Pitt campus, Ruiz said.

The P.E.E.R.S. program is
available to help prevent sexual
assault through awareness, in the
hopes that by educating people,
they will be more alert to what is
going on.

“This year we have more peo-
ple interested in the program than
ever,” Ruiz said.

One way this service helps is
to give individual and group
counseling to help with the tran-
ma a person has after the attack.

Over the past year, The Women’s T

Leadership , Forum has developed
Network ‘96 , an election year campaign
designed to reach out to Democratic
women and to encourage grassroots orga-
nization.

As part of this initiative First Lady
Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore, WLF
Honorary Chair, have been travelling
across the country in an effort to get
women excited about the Democratic
process and create an inclusiveness within
the Democratic Party.

Last Friday Tipper Gore spoke at
Pittsburgh’s Vista Hotel as a speaker for
the Network ‘96 travelling tour to a packed
room of WLF members and invited
guests.

SGB MEMBERS EXPRESS

OUTRAGE OVER NEW 11)  

By JENNIFER STINE
For The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
questioned the efficiency and useful-
ness of the new Pitt Card at their
meeting last week, after the
University announced that a second
ID card will be necessary to attend
student events.

Called the Student Activities
Card, this ID will be necessary for
undergraduates to vote in student
elections and participate in all events
sponsored by Pitt.

“I think it’s ridiculous,” said
SGB Environmental Committee
Chair Laura Frecon. “Why do we
need this orange thing when we
already have an ID?”

Under the old ID system, stu-
dents only had to present their IDs
with a current validation sticker to
vote, gain access to facilities, and
participate in student events.

A second ID became necessary
under the new system because the
Pitt Card doesn’t distinguish between
graduate students, undergraduates,
and faculty. Placing any stickers on
the Pitt Card will render it unwork-
able.

But carrying a second ID around
is only one of the inconveniences
that had many SGB members upset.

Alyson Wallach, SGB Judicial
Committee chair, said the new cards
are a problem because students must
pick up a new one every semester.
She said the new cards show how
unnecessary the Pitt Card is as an ID
system.

“In distributing the Student
Activities Cards, we’re finding out
how inefficient the PittCard is, and

' we’re going to work to have active

and loud voices in that regard,”
Wallach said.

Another problem with the
Student Activities Card is that, unlike
the Pitt Card, activities cards, can’t be
replaced.

“If at any time over the course of
the term you lose your activities
card, that’s too bad for you. You
can’t vote in elections, and you can’t
attend activities,” Wallach said.

David Teeters, another board
member, voiced his concerns about
the safety of the Pitt Card and
dubbed it “a disaster waiting to hap-
pen.”

But Teeters doesn’t think we
should scrap the Pitt Card in favor of
the old ID system. He said the Pitt
Card can accomplish a lot, and we
should work towards .making
American Express (sponsors of the
Pitt Card), more accountable to the
student body.

“I think our intentions at this
time should be towards not doing
away with the Pitt Card. That would
be a big mistake,” Teeters said.

Also discussed at last week’s
meeting were plans to open a non-
alcoholic pub on campus and the cre-
ation of a Residence Hall Task Force.
Teri Milani will head the task force
which will focus on all aspects of
residence life and how to improve it.

' Lisa Caplan was also assigned as
the new Community Relations chair.
She replaces Beth Wasel, who did
not return to Pitt this year. Board
member Brian Kavalukas was also
assigned as the new business manag-
er.

Students who haven’t received
their Student Activities Cards can
pick them up at the William Pitt
Union Ticket Office on Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday from 10 a.m.
to 9 p.m.; Wednesday from 11 a.m. to
9 p.m.; and Friday from 10 a.m. to 5

Attorney General cites
more police, less drugs as
reasons for crime drop

Around the World

BRUSSELS — NATO officials are
planning a summit conference
before next summer that will
expand the alliance to include the
16 current leaders, Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic
by 1999.

They also hope to add a new
military command structure that
will help the alliance deal with new
threats in the post-Cold War era.
But the new deal within the alliance
has leaders in the Baltic states of
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia wor-
ried about being left out and unpro-
tected against possible Russian
domination. The Washington Post

JOHANNESBURG — Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said that
President Clinton plans to intensify
U.S. efforts in Africa, despite the
widespread belief that Africa’s
importance to American interests
diminished after the Cold War.

Christopher said that “it is in
our interest to help Africa succeed”
and that the U.S. would benefit eco-
nomically, environmentally, and
politically now that many African
states are moving toward democra-
cy. The Washington Post

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — The FBI report-
ed yesterday that the nation’s crime
rate has dropped to its lowest level
in 10 years. The rate of violent crime
in 1995 dropped four percent from
the previous year.

The national murder rate
dropped eight percent in 1995, as
21,597 murders were recorded, a 13-
percent decline from 1991. The rate
of property crime fell by one percent
to 12 million, the lowest that rate
has been since 1987.

Attorney General Janet Reno
attributed the drop to less violent
crack cocaine markets, increases in
the number of police officers, more
prisons, and improved coordination
between federal, state, and local
authorities. The Washington Post

WASHINGTON — Thousands of
Latinos from around the country
held their first march on
Washington, sending a warning to
politicians not to take the nation’s
30 million Latinos for granted.

Event organizers said that this
group came to assert themselves at a
time when immigrants, and especial-
ly Latinos, are feeling unwelcome.

Organizers estimated that 25,000
people attended the rally, some com-
ing from as far as Los Angeles. The
Washington Post

Gore

remarks, Mrs. Gore spoke about the irnpor—
tance of the WLF, the women’s vote, the
Democratic Party, and the re-election of
Clinton and Gore.

She said that in 1992 Clinton won
office with 55% of his vote coming from
women, but that in the 1994 Congressional
elections 47 million eligible women voters
stayed home. This resulted in women mak-
ing up 60% of the drop-off voters.
According to Gore, if women had voted in
that election, the Democrats might have
retained control of Capitol Hill. That would
have effectively changed the outlook and
course America has taken the past two
years, she said.

“The significant advances women have
seemed during the first two years of the
Clinton/Gore Administration are being
challenged,” said Gore, “As women we
must make time for politics because politics
affect our everyday lives. We must ﬁnd the
time.’

Gore said that the traditional issues of

 

importance to women have taken center
stage under the Clinton Administration, cit-
ing such examples as the Family and
Medical Leave Act, the Violence Against
Women Act, and the Eamed Income Tax
Credit.

“[Clinton] is a president who has
implemented policies and laws that truly
impact the lives of women and families and
has not just talked,” stated Gore.

President Clinton has called the
Women’s Leadership Forum, “the most
dynamic, most important new force to
emerge from the Democratic National
Committee in decades.”

Don Fowler, Democratic Committee
Chair, has referred to it as “an indispensable
cornerstone of the 

The Forum was created in 1993 as a
means of supporting women’s initiatives in
politics and inspiring women to get
involved in the political process.

organization has been extremely successful
in its mission to create a structure within the
Democratic Party through which women
can make their voice heard.

The goal of the WLF is to politically
empower and galvanize women in the
Democratic Party throughout the country.
They hope to do this in three ways. The ﬁrst
way is by achieving three goals in the up
coming election: re—electing Clinton/Gore,
regaining Democratic control of Congress,
and electing Democratic candidates at every
political level. The second step is beoorning
an important source of frmd-raising at the
DNC. The third way they hope to mobilize
women Democrats is by developing a large
network of members and maintaining an
ongoing database of these members.

The WLF currently has 15 chapters all
across the nation in such cities as New York,
Miami, Houston, Detroit, and Seattle.

Democratic Party especially those dealing
with women’s issues.

While the WLF has been successful in
raising money for the Democrats, it has
done much more than otter ﬁnancial sup—
port. The DNC has beneﬁtted from a fresh
infusion of women’s ideas, energy, abilities,
and resources.

According to Cynthia Friedman,
National Co-Chair of the WLF and gradu-
ate of Pitt, ‘The Women’s Leadership
Forum is giving women a chance to make
their voice heard. There has never been any-
thing like this before. People are starting to
realize the impact women have and the
importance of the women’s vote in ‘96.”

The Network ‘96 speaking tour in
Pittsburgh attracted many women, old as
well as young, to join in the event.

Ebony McKinney, a junior at Chatham
College, attended the function because she
thought that women, especially young
women, need to become involved and edu-
cated in the process of politics.

She said she thinks the purpose of
Network ‘96 is, “So that women can
become more skillful and thus contribute to
their society and make their voice hear

She was discovered while working as a
receptionist at WSGN Radio, Birmingham,
Ala. Her voice was heard reading an adver-
tisement on the air, and she was oﬂ°ered a job.

\Viggin said she believes someone try-
ing to get into TV or radio must have a strong
liberal arts background, including excellent
writing skills.

“It alarms me there are [students] who
can’t write a coherent sentence,” she said.

VV1ggin also encouraged those interested
in being on TV to have foreign language
skills, espwially Spanish since so many areas
around the country have a large Spanish-
speaking population.

Michael Walsh, senior vice—president of
Ketchurn Communications, agreed that com-
petition in the ﬁeld is stiff.

‘‘l have some good news, some bad
news, and some bad, bad news,” Walsh said.
“The good news is that the communications
industry will grow, and there will be more
jobs. The bad news is the industry still only
makes up a segment of the world. The bad,
bad news is lots and lots of people want in.”

Walsh strongly encouraged networking,
saying that by the time a student graduates, he
or she should have at least 25 contacts in th
industry. 

He advised students to apply to compa-
nies that clearly need new workers.

“So many people send resumes to places
that aren’t hiring,” he said. “It’s not a slight
against you if you don’t get a job when they
aren’t hiring.”

Rebecca Farwell, editorial director of
Discovery Channel On—line, told students to

 

look at the intemet  another opportunity.

Farwell shared a story about a biologist
she hired to travel into the deepest areas of
Australia. His job was to send pictures over
the intemet and answer e—mail. He was
equipped with a lap top computer and a
device so that he could use his modern on any
phone.

The ﬁrst few days he sent out great pic-
tures but didn’t send any e—mail responses.
Farwell spoke with him about this problem.

“He said that his audience was stupid,
and half of them couldn’t even spell,” she
said. “I told him that most of his audience
were 1l—year—olds and that he was being paid
to write to them.”

He started sending them back short,
impersonal messages. However by the time

“It transformed him as a writer,” said
Farwell. “We need people that are good writ-

Robert Oltrnanns, a public relations prin-
cipal at Skutski & Oltmamrs, said he started

Oltrnamrs said that many successful peo-

ing using communications, you might do
well in public relations,” he said. “Don’t

He added that having at least two intem-
ships is necessary to even be looked at, and if

Belinda Thurston, assistant metro editor
of the North Hills News Record and a 1992
Pitt Graduate, said that newspaper writing
requires you to be a “jack of all trades.”

“Anything is going to be tossed at you
when you work as a writer —— you must be
resourceful,” she said.

Thurston interned at Pittsburgh Business
Times. She said it was the best thing she ever
did because it taught her what she didn’t
know by writing about unfamiliar topics.

She also enmuraged interning and said
another way to get your foot in the door of
journalism is to start at a small town newspa-

"Too many people go for a home-run

and talked about the abusive envi~
ronments in which many women
live.

“It took my sister to bring
[domestic abuse] to the forefront,”
Brown said. “I pledge my time,
energy, and voice that Nicole didn’t
die in vain.”

Forty percent of the women that
are killed die at the hands of their

L boyfriends or husbands, and 90 per-

cent of domestic abusers are male.
Brown has made over 100
appearances in various cities to
show that there is no excuse for
women being abused, and she said
that she feels her message is being
reached. Brown has been stopped

by women in gas stations, airports,
and restaurants who want to thank
her for helping them get out of a
bad situation.

Brown said this is how she
knows she is helping other women,
but often wonders if her sister
would still be alive if someone had
talked to her about handling domes-
tic abuse.

“When this first happened to
Nicole and I found her diaries, all I
could say was why didn’t she tell
me,” Brown said.

Brown also said that most
women feel if a husband is drinking
and beats her, the abuse is accept-
able. She is speaking out to show

this is not true, that there is never
an excuse for beating a woman.

The majority of women also feel
they are at fault and are bad people
deserving the abuse, Brown said.

“Good people can be blind to
bad situations,” Brown said.

Nicole was a good woman with
a huge heart, who did everything
for her kids, according to Denise.
She said there are many other
women in the same situation as
Nicole, and there are a lot of good
people who need to get out of a bad
situations.

“I learned in my journey I am
not alone in my pain or in the effort
to stop the abuse,” Brown said.

Candidate talks about old-fashioned campaigning

Melissa McGee

The Republicans are overworked,
understaffed, and behind in the polls,
but the College Republicans are still
fighting for their party.

Though Tuesday night’s meeting
started with an attempt to get more
members directly involved with the
Dole/Kemp campaign, the main
attraction of the evening was not the
activities in the works for the upcom-
ing presidential election, but for

Congressional candidate, Paul
Adametz.
Adametz told the College

Republicans that he would fight for
smaller government, along with lower
taxes, restoration of family values,
and gun rights.
Adametz, running
District against Congressman Ron
Klink, is from a small town in Butler
County where he lives with his wife,

 

in the 4th’

Katrina, and small son, Steven. He is
a printer and graphic designer by
trade, and he owns and operates his
own business in Pittsburgh. Adametz
never had dreams of being a politician
while growing up and insists that he is
not a politician.

“I have no desire to be a politi-
cian. I am a printer for a living, and I
always will be,” said Adametz.

Adametz said he was drawn to the
political arena when he started his
own business and saw how the gov-
ernment is always increasing taxes on
small businesses in this area.
According to Adametz, these busi-
nesses eventually get run out of town.

Adametz’s campaign is funded by
his own money and graphic designer
talents, along with many volunteers.
According to Adametz, officials in
Harrisburg refused to help, since they
feel that the 4th District is
unwinnable for a Republican.

Adametz disagrees.

“I can win this election. Ron
Klink has a lot of negatives attached
to him, and the only reason that he is
still in office is because there has
been no real Republican challenger,”
he said. “Well, I have changed that
this election.”

Finally, Adametz said he is not
running the traditional campaign,
even though it may cost him votes.

He turned down a chance to work
for Dole/Kemp Headquarters because
it would cut into his time with his
family.

Also, you will not be seeing any
signs saying “Adametz for Congress”
as you’re driving to school or work in
the upcoming weeks.

“My supporters may put up signs
on their own private property, but
only one sign on public property as
opposed to the dozens that you may
see in a five—yard radius for other can-
didates,” said Adametz. “I don’t want
non—voters to be annoyed by my signs

as they are driving down the road.”

Even though they are working on
several campaigns this fall, attending
political conventions, and sponsoring
many on—campus events, the College
Republicans say they are still looking
for more ways to become involved in
this election year.

Julia Choi, Dole/Kemp activities
director for the College Republicans,
spoke about volunteer opportunities
for the group that included working at
the phone banks and on a mass mail-
ing project at Dole/Kemp
Headquarters in Mt. Lebanon. Choi is
also planning to have events for
Dole/Kemp in the upcoming weeks.

The next College Republicans
meeting will be held on Oct. 22 at
8:30 p.m. in 106 David Lawrence
Hall.

Ron Klink, Adametz’s opponent,
will speak at the University
Democrats meeting tonight at 8 p.m.
in the Kurtzman room of the WPU.

Real men do cry

Excuse me for being more than a little
upset with the editorial on Monday, Oct. 7,
1996. The Editorial Board of The Pitt News
would have us believe that only “sissies” cry
in public, and the proper reaction in time of
crisis istopullagtmand startabarroom

to the student population. It’s a crying
shame! . V

“Oh! Are you upset? Are you sad
because your girlfriend left you? Here, here,
don’t cry! If she sees you crying, she will
think that you have some sensitivity and
compassion. You wouldn’t want that, would

over there and beat the hell out of her. Kick

The editorial mentioned Jim Leyland as
a “Crybaby.” Some other “crybabies” of note
mentioned in Gary Rotsteins’ Post-Gazette

This letter is in response to Jason
Morris’ article, “The Yankees and the

upcoming Yankees/Orioles American
League Championship Series. What kind of
research did Morris do for this article? Did
he even watch the two American League
Division Series? Where was he when Cal
Ripken batted .444 against Cleveland in the
four-garne series? Monis claims, and I

What makes

someone moral?

What causes someone to be a moral
person? What caused others to be brutes,
killers, and deceivers? There are ﬁve causal
factors which I call  inter-systemic. The
factors are: spiritual, social, political, eco-
nomic, and individual.

Spiritual factors are transcendental val-
ues and ideologies. They last more than a
generation. The great religious, political, and
philosophic thinkers are all spiritual or ideo-
logical inﬂuences. When spiritually awak-
ened, one is ﬁlled by the power of ideology
to create and recreate society. When spiritu-
allyasleep,oneisapttobeself-centeredand
nihilistic — as there is nothing trans-genera
tional to ﬁght for.

Social factors are ambient generation’s
values. Every generation faces differing
social values. Sometimes, social values
undermine spiritual ones. Sometimes they
are supportive. The pendulum always
swings...

Political factors are those legal powers

a bloody tyrant is going to be less appealing

Economic factors are the job opporturri—
ties available irr our lifetimes that allow us to
pursue productive and prosperous lives. I

country of the elite “North.” Had I been born
in less aﬁluent parts of the “South,” I might

largely constrains our opportunities, and
shapes our identities.

Finally, there are individual factors. We
are not blank slates to be written upon by the
events of our world and our pasts. We too
are creators, of ourselves and of the environ-
ment in which we live. We interact with the
world, bring thoughts and ideas we call “our
own,” and are inﬂuenced by our own bio-
logical predispositions: our natural abilities,
strengths, and weaknesses.

So what, you ask. I don’t introduce any-
thing radically new here. But ask yourself
this when you graduate: how has your edu-
cation helped you to understand the spiritu-
al, social, political, and economic circum-
stances of our times? And how, if at all, has
it empowered you to do anything to change
these circumstances?

James L. Rowell
Graduate, Religious Studies

The rich are thieves

I would like to respond to Jay
DeMartino’s colurrm, “We need to analyze
the myths of gov’t...” The real ﬂaw in our
system is not that we allow the wealthy to
use their money to give their children a bet-
ter education, but that we allow the super-
wealthy to use their wealth to steal the ﬁuits
of other people’s labor. How? By monopo-
lizing natural resources such as land and
minerals, thus monopolizing opportunity
itself, and appropriating the wealth generat-
ed by the entire community, in the form of
increasedlandandmineral values. Forany
particular piece of land has value, not so
much for what it is itself, but for what’s
around it (e.g., roads, other businesses...)
Many individuals in the community create
land value, but a few unjustly reap the
reward

The great libertarian philosophers
throughout history, such as John Locke,
Adam Smith, Tom Paine, Thomas Jefferson,
John Stuart Mill, Henry George, etc., have
all warned against such a system, and advo-
catedchargingauserfeeforlandandother
natural resources. (They also advocated, as
do all libertarians, that no other taxes exist.)
Theyviewedtheearthastl'lenaturalinheri-
tance of all mankind, not properly treated as
purely private property. Individuals still
must be able to exercise exclusive control
over their lands, but they must pay the rest of
the community a market-driven yearly
rental.

To show the ﬂaw in Mr. DeMartino’s
View that education opportunity is the key,
consider what would happen if everyone
weresuddenlytohavethebrainofan
Einstein and the strength of a
Schwarzenegger. We’d be a lot more pro-
ductive, but would workers or business
owners keep the extra fruits of their labor?
No, they’d just end up paying higher rents
for their apartments or business locations,
since now “everyone” would be able to
afford higher rents (and land prices would

Life is the most
important right

I read, with some amusement, the state-
ment in last Thursday, October 3rd’s, “Right
to die” editorial that “Of life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, the most necessary
would be liberty.” If so, then why did
Thomas Jefferson and the founding fathers
write “Life, liberty, and the pursuit...” in that
order?

There is a reason in western liberal
democratic theory for why “' e” comes
ﬁrst. It is a foundational principle upon
which the rest of our society is built — it is
a higher-order right. \Vrthout the principle
thathumanlifeismoresacredthananyother
human’s “right” or wish to end it, neither lib-
erty nor the pursuit of happiness, neither
equality nor fraternity (slogans of the French
revolution), -— basically, none of the other
principles of western democracy on which
our system is built — have any meaning.

Abortion lies

In 1973, Norma McCorvey (aka Jane
Roe) lied before the Supreme Court when
sheclairnedthatshewasrapedandshould
be allowed to have an abortion. Continuing
this tradition, in the “Arc abortions minder
or medical? A Valued Medical Procedure”
column, pr. taylor’s attempt to spread lies
and dehumanize the partial-birth abortion
procedure was appalling. I attended the
armual Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation
Convention on September 28-30, and I
would like to correct some of the misinfor-
mation in taylor’s column.

Taylor quoted Dr. Creinin as saying the
procedure is perfectly legal and performed
after 24 weeks. Also, babies have been
known to survive outside the womb at early
ages such as 19 weeks, and the generally
acceptedagethatababycansurviveis21
weeks. Taylor quoted Dr. Creinin as saying
“this is never an elective procedure and is
only perfomred where severe genetic abnor-
malities exist.” However, Dr. Martin
Haskell, who has performed over 1,000 par-
tial-birth abortions, said that he performs
them routinely for non—medical reasons, and
that 80 percent are “purely elective” accord-
ing to American Medical News in July
1993.

Taylor quoted Dr. Creinin as saying
‘This procedure is rare; they constitute only
about 500 a year.” However, The Record of
Hackensack, NJ ., reported that a single clin-
ic in that state “performed 1,500 partial-birth
abortions in one year alone.”

Taylor wrote that she would “like
everyone to just calm down and get a life.” I
wonder what she really means when she
says “life.”

Although this week is little but a pre-
amble leading to Friday’s Phish show,
something interesting happened in New
York Shitty last Wednesday.

It should come as no surprise that 12-
year-old Yankee fan Jeffrey Maier has been
thrust into the spotlight after one of the most
glaring acts of incompetence in the history
of sports, considering we live in a society
where O.J. Simpson ﬁolics freely on golf
courses across the western hemisphere, and
Nirvana can still cash in on the suicide of
Kurt Cobain.

The incident of reference should be of
common knowledge by now, unless you’ve
been too busy thinking about potential traf-
ﬁc disasters when Bigelow Boulevard re-
opens on Wednesday. (To keep it closed, I’m
suggesting a sit-in. We could gain national
cable exposure for the effort.)

Just in case, I’ll reﬁesh your bong-
soaked, hungover minds. During the bottom
of the eighth inning of game one of the
ALCS, Derek Jeter hit a long, ﬂy ball way
back. Back far enough to merit Orioles’ right
ﬁelder Tony Tarasco reaching the wall. For
some mysterious reason, Tarasco choose not
to jump for the ball. Rather strange, since
being the playoffs and all, hustle should
come with the tenitory.

Had the lazy, whining Tarasco chosen
to leap, this unfortunate situation would
have been avoidc:-xi. However, Tarasco, like
most athletes of the day, usually expends as
little energy as possible, but that’s another
story.

Anywhoo, the young Maier, full of
sound and fury (signifying nothing), salivat-
ed at the chance of any young boy’s dream
——thechancetomeetFrancoHarrisatan
Italian restaurant I mean, catching a home
run ball in the playoffs, off the bat of your
favorite team, nonetheless.

Maier failed to catch the ball, but he will
forever live in baseball lore — nestled in
Yankee conversations with greats like Ruth,
Mantle, and Bernie Wﬂliarns, arguably the
the pinstripes since

Football woes continue as Pitt
plays against stronger toes

..M9"T9wn. end  

 

The Pitt football team
reverted back to its old ways on
Saturday against Syracuse, get-
ting pounded 55-7. Pitt hasn’t
won in the Carrier Dome since
1984.

Horrendous special teams
continued the trend and allowed
three touchdowns and
turnovers that shortened the
field for_ the powerful
Orangemen offense all day
long.

“It’s just about as bad as it
could be today, especially in the
second ha  said Head Coach
Johrmy Majors. “The kicking
game really won the game for
them today. They scored on our
mistakes.”

Pitt’s conﬁdence was shak-
en from the outset as they were
forced to punt without a ﬁrst
down on their opening posses-
sion. The key play of the pos-
session was a pressured third-
down pass to Billy West that
lost 10 yards.

On the Nate Cochran punt,
a Pitt fumble recovery was
negated after a missed call by
the ref. The ensuing 11-play,
37-yard drive resulted‘ in a
Syracuse 36-yard ﬁeld goal.
Darnell Dinkins made an ankle
tackle on a swing pass on third
down to hold the Orangemen to

 

the ﬁeld goal.

A West fumble on the next
possession gave Syracuse the
ball in prirne-ﬁeld position at
the Pitt 37. After two runs by
quarterback Donovan McNabb
for 15 yards, Malcom Thomas
rumbled 14 yards to the three.
On second and goal, McNabb
optioned to bruising fullback
Rob Konrad, who scored to
give Syracuse the lead 10-0.
Last season, Konrad scored
three TDs against the Panthers.

“They have so many for-
mations, and sometimes it gets
conﬁising out there,” saidjunior
linebacker Earnest Coakley.

Pitt confusion continued
on offense when Lytle threw
over the middle, and the ball
was jarred loose by free safety
Donovan Darrius and then
intercepted by Phil Nash.

The turnover gave
Syracuse a short ﬁeld to work
with, and they wasted little
time, scoring in four plays to
put them up 17-0. On the sec-
ond play of the drive, McNabb
dropped back to pass and then
scrambled, leaving Pitt defend-
ers in his wake for a 19-yard
gain to set up another short
touchdown run by Komad.

On Pit1’s next drive, West
converted a third-and-one. The
drive was stopped after Darrius

Volleyball cruises through weekend of wins

 

Freshman Julie Cress helped Pitt to five straight wins.

 

In most sports, a team
is capable‘ of playing ugly
at times and still being able
to get the job done. The Pitt
volleyball team reinforced
this age-old adage with a
weekend of unusually high
service errors and a few
sluggish starts, in addition
to some solid play en route
to a undefeated weekend at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt (11-8, 2-0 Big
East) swept the weekend
with victories over non-
conference opponent Kent
and Big East enemies
Seton Hall and Rutgers.
While all three matches
were close, it looked as if
Rutgers gave the Lady
Panthers the most trouble

on Sunday afternoon.

“It was like pulling a
wagon through mud,” said
Pitt Head Coach Cindy
Alvear. “It was tough to see
them struggle and have to
try and find ways to help.”

Pitt took the match, 15-
10, 14-16, 15-10, and 15-7
over Rutgers (18-6, 0-2),
but not without a fight. The
Lady Panthers began the
game trailing in its first
three games against the
New Jersey squad before
rallying for victories in
games one and three.

The Lady Knights led
most of the first game until
the score reached 10-7. Pitt
crawled through with a
.114 kill percentage but
came back with eight unan-
swered points and the win.

loss of the season.

The Lady Panthers lost
their game against Niagara 4-2,
dropping their record to 2-11.

Melissa Zedo paced
Niagara with two goals, both in

added a goal and an assist.
Niagara’s goaltender, Suzanne
Klick, faced ﬁve shots but did
not register a save on her way
to the Purple Eagle’s third win
of the season to go along with
their seven losses and one tie
(3-7-1).

Only 9:53 into the contest,
Niagara’s Lynda Hughes
scored, and Lannier chipped in
with an assist to give the Purple
Eagles the early 1-0 lead, but
Pitt would soon answer.

The Lady Panthers came
right back, and they took the
lead in the first half, scoring
two unanswered goals. Pitt
senior Tracy Mascari tied the
game with an unassisted goal

an added-extra bonus, we can get
involved in the game. Let’s start
rushing the ﬁeld when we see an

Special teams seem to be missing somethi

Kevintillei  

   

Pitt’s Hank Poteat went into
Saturday’s game at Syracuse lead-
ing the Big East in kick return
yardage. Panther Curtis Anderson
was second to his teammate, while
John Jenkins was fourth in the con-
ference retuming punts.

While the Panthers’ rank was
deep in the Big East’s second divi-
sion in nearly all other categories,

‘the v special teams had yet to be
matched.

Until Saturday.

While Donovan McNabb and
his Orangemen option offense
gained only 355 total yards, the
Syracuse return game piled up 239
yards in only seven tries — setting
up drives, scoring two touch-
downs, and playing a very big role
in a 55-7 Pitt loss.

“When teams win games,
they do things like that,” said Pitt
Head Coach Johnny Majors.
“When your special teams score

like that, the offense doesn’t have
todoasgoodofajo .”
Pitt’s return specialists

answered with 204 yards on 11
tries, including a one-yard gain by
Poteat on Pitt’s only punt retum.
The 18.6-yard average is ﬁve
yards below the team’s normal

output, and resulted in the Panthers
starting every drive but one inside
their own 30-yard line.

Syracuse fared a bit better in
the freld—position department,
starting only three drives inside its
20. More importantly, special
 served as the start and the
ﬁnish of three drives for the
Orange, scoring only one less
touchdown than the Syracuse
offense.

The first strike came courtesy
of the Orangemen punt team,
whose collective bull-rush of Nate
Cochran deep in Pitt territory
resulted in a block and a touch-
down. Syracuse’s Mike Brown
knocked down the ball after slip-
ping past the Panther protectors,
and Phil Nash recovered for an
easy score. Nathan Trout’s extra
point put Syracuse ahead 24-0.

Pitt would recover with a
touchdown near the end of the
half, beneﬁting from Anderson’s
23-yard kick return. It was the
longest of the game since Poteat’s
game-opening retum for 27 yards.
The longs for both men were
under their averages for the season.

Panther retum numbers were
overshadowed in a hurry opening
the second-half kickoff, when
Syracuse’s Jim Turner ran 102
yards untouched for an

“In the locker room at half
time, we were all still excited,”
said Pitt linebacker Ernest
Coakley. “We thought we were
still in the football game. But after
that kickoff in the second half, it
kind of brought some people’s

13

ng special

spirits down.”

Majors had a similar take on
the back-breaking return, which
took only I l seconds for the
Syracuse track star to complete.

“It breaks your heart,” said the
coach. “Zip, right down the field. It
takes the wind out of your lungs.
lt’s demoralizing to the football
team, and an uplift to the other
team.”

Panther spirit was held in
check for the second half, with the
olfense starting every drive at or
before their 30. Poor ﬁeld position
and the Syracuse defense com-
bined to keep Pitt scoreless and
conﬁned to the Panther side of
midﬁeld for all but one drive.

Late in the fourth, with the
outcome already decided, the
Orangemen struck again. Cochran
boomed a punt from the Pitt 20 to
the Syracuse 27, where Kevin
Johnson began his 73-yard return
for the garne’s ﬁnal score. Cochran
appeared to outkick his coverage,
giving Johnson enough early run-
ningroomtoﬁndaseaminthePitt
defense. The seam didn’t close
until he was in the end zone.

“The kicking game gave them
three direct scores  it’s just unbe-
lievable,” said Majors. “The kick-
ing game killed us all the way
aroun ”

The Lady Panthers bounced
back from a six-point deficit in
game two, had two game points at
14-13, and failed to close out the
stanza. Rutgers eventually won the
next three points and tied the match
at one game apiece.

“I was real honest with them,”
said Alvear after the game two loss.
“We were obviously struggling,
and when a team is struggling, [I
told them] you have to force your-
self to move. You have to commu-
nicate more and make eye contact.
You just have to be bigger than the
way you feel.”

Alvear’s squad took game
three, but not without controversy.
Tied at seven, Panther hitter Julie
Cress fired a shot past all six
Rutgers players and hit the back
line judge at the right corner of the
court. The ball was called in, but it
could not be determined by head
referee Steve Grabowski whether
the kill would have actually been
out. Grabowski let the call stand,
and Pitt went on to win seven of the
next 10 points en route to the game
three victory.

The Pitt freshmen then led the
way to victory in the final stanza as
Jessica Van Der Mallie and Paula
Zemrowski finished with a com-
bined four kills in the last five
Panther points for the match. Van

Der Mallie was the key to the vic-
tory over the Scarlet Knights with
18 kills, 11 digs, and a .44] attack
percentage.

“We made about two or three
adjustments,” Alvear said after the
final match of the weekend. ‘‘I
wanted them to make attacks
straight up the middle, and switch
our defense and block setup 
which saw some success.”

Another reason for the Lady
Panthers’ weekend success was
first—year player Peggy Meinhart.
The hitter came in at key situations
during the Rutgers match and
delivered eight kills, one block, and
an ace. Meinhart finished the week-
end with 21 kills.

“Peggy had a very good week-
end,” said Alvear. “The first week
of preseason, she just escalated.
She had been on a plateau, and now
it looks as if she seems to be going
up again. We need that desperate-
ly.”

Hitter Jennie Driscoll turned in
her usual power performance with
17 kills and four blocks. The senior
finished with 43 hits, eight blocks,
and 16 digs in the three matches
over the weekend.

Pitt defeated Kent (12-7) in its

Football

After showing no offense in the ﬁrst 25
minutes of the game, Pitt mounted a touch-
down drive. It was the ﬁrst and last time in
the game they moved past the 50 yard line.
Behind the running of Dwayne Schulters,
Pitt maneuvered down to the 24 yard line.
Lytle then rainbowed a pass to Jake Holfart
for Pitt’s only score of ﬂie game.

“I knew I could get open on the play,”
said Hoffart. “They were in a zone, and I
juked one defender, and Lytle saw me and
hit me with a good pass.”

VV1th momentum swinging towards Pitt
at the end of the second half, it was all but
lost when Jim Turner returned the second
halfkick—off 102 yards unmolested for a 31-
7 Syracuse advantage.

“In the locker room we were excited
because we were still in the game,” said
Coakley. “Then the kick—off happened, and
it took all the wind from our sails.”

After another Syracuse touchdown
made it 38-7, Majors brought in Pete
Gonzales to rim the offense. Gonzales could
do no better, as Pitt went three and out.
Seeing that the game was a blowout, Majors
subbed in many young players in the third

and fomth quarters.

“We played many young players today.
It’s something that we might start doing
more of,” said Majors.

With the game in hand, Syracuse
brought in back—up quarterback Keith
Downing. On his ﬁrst possession at the helm
of the offense, Downing capped a drive with
a 21-yard touchdown run. He faked a hand
off and then ran left around the Pitt defense,
going untouched into the end zone. That
made the score 48-7.

The ﬁnal special teams mishap hap-
pened near the end of the game when Kevin
Johnson returned a punt 73 yards for a
touchdown. He ran up the middle of the
ﬁeld where no Pitt player was in sight until
Cochran made a futile dive at him on his
way down the sideline.

“I thought we had a better chance
today,” Majors said. “We played better in the
ﬁrst half. There was just no ball game today.
Syracuse is a good team and can play with
anyone in the country. We have a week off
next week, and that will give the players and
coaches time to regroup and hopefully get a
fresh start.”
