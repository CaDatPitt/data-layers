Trustees Propose
Election Method

To Alumni Council

Dr. Bowman Meets with Graduate
‘ ‘Group to Prepare New Plan

Another crisis in the stormy relationship between the General
Alumni Association and the University arose this week over the
method of selecting alumni representatives to the Board of Trustees.

This development concerns a proposal submitted Monday night
by Chancellor John G. Bowman to a closed meeting of the Alumm

Council in the Faculty Club.

Basis of the nevv plan Vvas to pY'0V1(lP that the Alumni ;’\SSOCl-‘sl-

tion should nominate a "panel of
30 candidates from which the
Board of Trustees could elect
members to ﬁll its quota of 15
alumni representatives.

This method would, if approved
by the Alumni Council and adopt-
ed by the Board of Trustees, re-
place the present system by which
the alumni Association elects 15

M “nominees,” all _of whom are ac-

cepted by the Board of Trustees as
members.

The present system violates the
University charter in that it forces
the Board of Trustees to delegate
its responsibility in electing mem-
bers, according to a message from
the nominating committee of the
F.’-oard, transmitted to Alumni Coun-
cil by Dr. Bowman.

“The trustees may not accept
alumni nominations as though they
were appointments to the Board.
The alumni, therefore, should nomi-
nate a group from which the trus-

tees may. elect members to fill
alumni-trustee vacancies when
they ,. occur,” Dr. Bowman ex-

plained. ,
Alumni Prepare Election

Until this week, the Alumni As-
sociation has been preparing to
elect 13 nominees to the Board of
Trustees to replace a group no-mi-
nated -by the alumni and elected
by the Board in 1937.

Presentation of the new proposal
to. the Alumni Council Monday
night has. caused a suspension of
preparations for the alumni elec-
tion, which had been scheduled for
next month, until a settlement can
be reached between the trustees
and the Alumni Association.

No definite action was taken on
the proposal at Monday night’s
meeting. John B. Nicklas, president
of the Alumni Association, refused
to comment on the proposal or on
the likelihood of future action by
the alumni.

Bowman Explains Plan

Dr. Bowman, explaining the plan
prepared by the five-man nominat-
ing connnitt-ee of the board, pointed
out that alumni of each of 10
schools of the University would
place three graduates on a panel
of‘ nominees from which the Board
of Trustees would choose one man

600 High School Students
To See ‘Dido & Aeneas’

Some 800 high honor students of
high schools in Pittsburgh and Alle-
gheny county will be guests at the
ﬁnal and closed performance of
“Dido and Aeneas,” all student
opera, in Foster memorial tomor-
row evening.

The ﬁnal public performance of

p the opera, the first to be undertaken

by any student ‘body in Pittsburgh,
will take place in Foster Memorial
this evening at 8:15 o’clock. Tickets,
priced at 50 cents, may still be ob-
tained from cast members.

“Dido and Aeneas” is a joint proj-
ect of four student organizations of
the University: W omen’s Choral,

Call a Cop.’

along Fifth avenue, and walked
into the Cathedral with a bundle
of journalism papers under his
arm.

Later in the afternoon, Mr. Ma-
chesney came out of the Cathedral,
repaid his compliments to the po-
liceman, who was busily engaged
tagging overtime parkers along
both sides of Fifth and Lytton ave-
nues, and took the few steps to
where he had parked his car.

He found no tag on his car—not
even a teeny chalk mark. Instead
a smashed car window awaited him
and he found that a new suit of
clothes had been snatched.

And the cop still continued to
tag parkers.

And Mr. Machesney is without
his new blue suit.

WAA, Men’s Glee Club, and the
string ensemble from the symphony
orchestra. The groups, have been
coached by l\/Irs. Mildred Lissfelt,
director of the choral; Dr. Elizabeth
Rearick, associate professor of
physical education; Miss Gladys.
professor of music appreciation.

Heading thecast are eight princi-
pals: Miriam G-oldstein, C41; Wil-
liam Schneider, Ed41; Louise Mar-‘
golis, C41; Peggy Johnston, C42;
leorgetta Davis, Ed40; Dorothy
Brown, C41; Lee McCollough, C40;
Robert Bosler, BA40. Over a hun-
dred additional students will com-
plete the cast.

The following members of WAA
will act as student hostesses at to-
rnorroW’s performance: Lillian Bag-
ley, E5140; Barbara Griﬁin, Ed40;
Johanna Chesnick, Ed/ll; Mary Hil-
da Fagan, Ed41; Irma Hotz, Ed41;

Panther Club Sponsors

Tea Dance at Schenley

The Panther Club, undergraduate
varsity lettermen’s organization,
will sponsor a tea dance Monday at
the Hotel Sch.en1ey.

With music by Rusty Williams,
dancing will continue from 2:30 un.-
til 6 o’clock, and admission will be
25 cents, according to Joe Kristu-
fek, president.

for each alumni-trustee vacancy.

Every three years, the panel of 30
nominees would be revised by the
Alumni Association. An important
point of the new proposal was that
alumni representatives on the
Board, when their terms expire,

may be re-elected by the Board as V

a1umni—trustees.

“In any plan adopted, an alumni
trustee may be continued as an
alumni trustee at the discretion of
the Board. This practice has long
been in effect and has abundantly
proved its value,’’ declared Dr.
Bowman.

“Gentlemen’s Agreement”

The present method of election
of alumni trustees, by which 13
men were elected in 1937, none in
1938, and two last year, developed
following a conﬂict between former
Governor George H. Earle in 1936,
in which the governor threatened
to cut off the University’s biennial
appropriation.

Interpretin.g ‘this situation ‘Mon- ,

day night, Dr. Bowman declared,
“There is no definite arangement
about alumni representation on the
Board of Trustees-—-nothing but a
gentlemen’s agreement.”

Council Will Act

Official action. on the proposal by
the Alumni Council is expected.
within the next week.

Citing advantages of the new

plan, Dr. Bowman declared that‘

it would avoid violation of the
University’s charter, assure wider
representation on the Board of
Trustees from all schools, and give
alumni of each school a chance to
vote for candidates whom they
would know best.

Members of the Board of Trus-
tees nominating committee, which
perpared the plan are Samuel A.
Taylor, ’87, chairman; George H.
Clapp, ’77; Holgar Johnson, ’22;
Hugh Thompson Kerr; and C. W.
Ridinger, ’93.

Debaters Meet
Tartan Teams

rnan debaters will debate represen-
tativcs from Carnegie Tech in their
qecond collegiate debate of the sea-
son tofmorrow at 2:30 o’clock in 1617

Varsity debaters will meet a team
from American college, Washing"-
ton, D. (3., tomorrow afternoon on
the question: “Resolved: That the
United States should have complete
military and economic isolation
from all nations outside of the West-
ern Hemisphere which are engaged
in armed civil or international con-
flict.” ~ .

Taking the aﬂirmative side for
the University will be Ralph Nad-
ler, C42, and Harold Byer, C42. '

From the Other
Side of the Tracks

Instead of a general snr\'cy of the parking prob-
lem in Oakland, we reprint for the int'orn1ation of
[l1ll\'€l'Sll)' students several notes from the April
issue of The Winged Head, magazine of the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association:

“We understand the general health of many
Pitt students has improved noticeably since park-
ing regulations have been enforced. Also there
have been more shoes sold in Oakland in the past
few weeks, and cobblers are doing a. big business.”

“One member was astounded that a school that.
is unable to support a big league coach or football
team has a student body that can corral so much
of the best parking space extant in the vicinity of
Fifth and Lytton Avenues.”

“With the baseball season approaching and
parking regulations being enforced, who knows
but that members may be able to eat lunch at the
Club and drop over to the ball game——on time.”

“One member was heard to remark that the
enforcing of traffic regulations is a real Public
service. He predicts the club will now be able ‘G0
pay its taxes.”

“Taking a particular interest in the police de-
partment’s activities hereabouts recently have

been certain groups of bondholders. Guess who?”

\\v’e believe that these comments illustrate the
atniosphcre of refinement: and culture which eman-
ates from the pilastci-ed pillars on the otlier side of
Fifth Avenue.

All News FPO!!!
The §Var Areas Ism-

By the time this appears most I-'\1ncri_ca.i1s will
have gotten over their first shock. at the spreading,‘
of the vsar to Scandinavia, traditional land of
peace. By this time they will be forming strong
opinions of blame and hate, of n'iist'r-ust or outright
aiitagonisni toward one side or the other.

Tlicse opinions will be based upon news .J.'0tt<~‘»17l
from radio and newspaper reports, news censored
and distorted at its source, or made from “reported
broadcasts picked up in Bucharest.”

Pecause of the passion that may run high, and
because of the importance of clear thought now,
this seems the best time to recall an old ‘saw about
a cool head and clear thought, and the current
maxiin that “all news coming from the war areas

is censored.”

The Bawdy Politic

By S. F. Ayers

(The following is the first part of a letter written by
a University student to a student at a large midwest-
ern school. It is in answer to a request for a deSCTil3'
tion of the kind of student government at Pitt and how
this government works. The second part will be pub-

lished later.)

Dear Bill,

Going from the speciﬁc to the general, let me Start
with the governing bodies that control particular groups
and areas. Probably most powerful of these groups is:

The Women’s Self-Government Assn.

This is an organization which is in charge of all
strictly wo-men’s activities. WSGA has a rather com-
plete hierarchy of control through the women’s Senior
Court, class officers, committee heads, and representa-
tives from groups like Women’s Choral, YWCA, and
the Women’s Athletic Association.

WSGA is actually a potent instrument in the per-
sonnel program of the dean of women; freshman ori-
entation programs, teas, nominating and training of-
ﬁcers of the main. womcn’s organizations, and a com-
plete program of ceremonies and traditions (a partic-
ular interest of the dean of women) are its most im-
portant functions.

WSGA’s actual powers are only those which it ob-
tain by its connection with the dean of women’s of-
fice. It has an ample budget, relatively, granted by the
University’s administration which it uses to ﬁnance the
social and ceremonial affairs. I

Analogous to WSGA on the male side is:

M en’s Council

This organization deals with “strictly men’s activ-
ities” in the undergraduate schools. All these seem
to consist of are supervision of freshmen men’s customs
and Sponsoring a smoker for men’s transfer students
from other schools.

However during the last two years the Council
has operated a student book exchange, for used books
only; this service has been popular and open t0 311
students. Fifteen percent of the sale price is deducted
by the council to be added to a student loan fund ad-
ministered by the dean of men’s office and theoretically
by council oﬂ“1cers. Like WSGA, Men’s Council has
no other powers than those it gets from connection with
the dean of men’s office. Its budget is minor league,
very minor league.

Besides these organizations there are special school
groups such as:

College Association, Engineering
Association, and Mines Association

These organizations, theoretically student govern-
ment groups, do little more than sponsor one or two
dances a year, and raise money for student loan funds
administered by the offices of the deans of the schools
or by the advisers to the organization.

I object to the third-term-—this or any third-term—--
on the ground that it contradicts American democracy.
This system of government rests on the premise that
the people operate it-—not one man or one group of
men. The selﬁsh and the disowned can be kept in line
by. not the unsung, but the now unhummed middle-
class. America is big enough and healthy enough to
get along on its own steam. It needs no alleged super-
man. Only when our affairs are dictated by the people
will they be for the people. And Nietzsche be damned!

Morals, Morals Every:-vlzerc!

And now Bertrand Russell is being taken for a
“moral ride.” He is honest about solving sex problems,
so a Manhattan jurist has ruled that Lord Russell is
not a ﬁt man to teach in the College of the City of New
York. He might tell the kiddies the truth, and then
where would we be‘? It is inferred that the British
psychologist-mathematician would be a satisfactory
teacher if he looked askance at life and kept mum. In-
c-identally, this keeping aloof and being non-communi-
cative is a success formula that pays—of‘f. As witness
your campus biggies.

The Depression Is Over.’

One Maxine Davis writes in the Cosmopolitan. “Too
many young people today are making their youth an
inglorious career . . though times are betto" f‘m.l"l’1
better, they cannot rid themselves of the notion thzzt
fate is against them . . they see themselve= as ﬁg-
ures of high tegedy, victims of forces beyond their
control, against which they are helpless.” Well, what
do you know about that? The depression is over! I
think Ameri.ca’s unemployed ought to be told. I think
this year’s senior class ought to be informed, too. I
think it’s about time somebody let us in on the secret
——that the man behind the desk who consistently re-
cites, “Leave your name and ’phone number. We’ll
call you if there’s an opening” is only joshingl

And fate isn’t against youth. No! Just because the
Army spent $2,600,000 for transforming the regular
army corps into a unit prepared to do battle on imme-
diate orders, doesn’t mean a thing. The Army’s Chief
of Staff is merely trying to appear busy. That’s all.

Said. Time last week: “Any foreign attache looking
at the new U. S. Army) this_sp'ring will recognize it for

by Kalwary

what it is:,a. standing eacpeditionary force, designed for ,0

prompt, conscript expansion. into an expcd.itiona7'y army
of 750_,000 active troops, 250,000 reserves.”

Come now, Miss Davis! Tells us they’re just tin
sol.die'rs—-to be sold at Christimas-time.

Common Sense

By “Senator” Ziskind

‘We must begin building up our shock absorbers.
Spring is being ushered in to the -accompaniment of
omnious predictions. The mere patrol “contacting” on
the Western front is to change into a hellish fury.
Germany’s 25,000 airplanes are to reduce Paris and
London to shambles, and the Atlantic ocean is to be-
come an ocean of blood. Mars and Satan are once more
to take their seat in the almighty and puny, misbe-
having man to become their worshipers.

We are complacent now. Right new public opinion
in the United States loathes any mention of coopera-
tion with any European camp. We hate war and we
will have none of it.

All this is understandable. We haven’t had a chance
to get aroused. We hear of the sinking of a ship or a

patrol skirmish, and that’s that.

Spring Awakening

But spring, things will be different. That will bring
the test. A Then will the American public rise out of its
lethargy, and it will demand action. It will see the
ﬁgure of Herr Hitler, the symbol of brute force and
aggression, strutting across Europe as a mighty Colossus,
leaving broken cities and heaps of shattered bodies in
his wake. It will see the culture of fellow Britishers
and Frenchmen uprooted and spat upon to make way
for “super men.” It will see decency and righteousness
forced to bend to ignorance and militarism.

That’s why I say that we must begin building up
our shock absorbers. We must begin building up our
airplane factories and munition plants, having tre-
mendous supplies on hand, to send England and France.
We must begin gearing our economy to serve the
Credit interests of England and France. We must trans-
fer title from ships not in use to help enlarge the ship
tonnage of the Allied powers. We must prepare public
opinion for the shock by letting the public know that
we are doing everything possible to help England and
France, short of war.

Not Road to War

You, no doubt, are critical of my suggestion be-
cause you feel that I am advocating the road to war.
Not at all, for I would be the last to sanction the send-
ing of American soldiers to ﬁght on European soil. I
consider this program our surest way of keeping out of
war.

The isolationist who takes the “mind our own busi-
ness” attitude is the most dangerous man in American
life today. His advice, if pursued to its conclusion
under the strain of a European inferno. would inevi-
tably cause our public to crack under the pressure of
“cowardice,” and such a burst of public indignation
would surge forth that we would plunge head-oveiu
heels into the ﬁre.

We must begin promoting a sane program of co-
operation with England and France short, of course,
of direct intervention. That is our only course if we
want to keep our boys from wallowing in European
mud. The American public would refuse to remain im-
potent when brute force is given free sway, when Hit-
lerism is permitted to drag whole peoples and cultures
into the “oppobrious den of Hell.”

Mellon Institute Studies Get Results

Patents on Varied Inventions Crown Efforts

By Ray Palkot

Studies in the Mellon Institute on
everything from the 31 different
conditions of shaving to the inven-
tion of three new dessert recipes re-
sulted in 32 United States and 35
foreign patents last year, reveals Dr.
E. R. Weidlein, director of the Mel-
lon Institute, in his annual report
to the trustees tonight.

Most of the work done during the
fiscal year, lV[arch 1, 1939, to March
1, 1940, was a part of a continuous
program of research on the part of
the 91 industrial fellowships estab-
lished by various industrial com-
panies, Dr. Weidlein said in his re-
port.

In addition to the patents obtain-
ed on fellowship inventions, seven
bulletins, 26 research papers, and

54 other articles came from the In-
stitute last yar.

In food research, the multiple fel-
lowship of H. J. Heinz company per-
fected three new dessert recipes
v:hich are now being produced. as
Heinz junior foods. In addition to
these, the scientists also developed
a new variety in the strained food
line and arepworking on new cereals
to be placed on the market.

An investigation into shaving
showed that there are 31 distinct
variations in shaving that affect the
user of the razor. It was found
that the average man has 24,000
hairs on his face to cut and each of
these are about .006 inches in diam-
eter. Studies into durability of car-
bon steel for razors seems encourag-
ing. Dr. Weidlein reports.

Research also brought to light a

Fine Arts Galleries Exhibit
Show on ‘Housing and Houses’

“Housing and Houses,” a travel-
ing exhibition of the Museum of
Modern Art, is now on view in the
fine arts galleries on the seventh
ﬂoor. Assembled in collaboration
with the United States, Housing
authority, the series of posters and
models outline the problems and
progress of modern home building.

Beginning with the problems of
housing arising from the coming
the industrial revolution and the
development of crowded urban liv-
ing, the exhibit traces the solution
offered by eminent architects to
those problems.

One of the chief solutions shown
is Pittsburgh’s own Terrace Village,
part of the Pittsburgh Housing
authority's project on three hills
above Oakland. _

The poster shows graphically the
great problem faced by the build-
ers and how they have solved. it
by putting into use. a large section
01‘ marginal land, and adding to
the parks and recreation centers of
the city.

Solutions of housing problems by
the foreign as well as American
architects and planners are por-

In’ The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last Friday evening it was my
great fortune to be among the audi-
ence in the beautiful new Foster
Memorial to witness the Pitt pro-
duction “Adding Machine.” It was
a real inspiration to visit my old
campus once again to mingle with
students and their parents in a.
new setting. Just as the artistic
building in which we were seated
marked an advancement in the
University’s development, so did
the splendid performance by the
Pitt students reveal an advance-
ment in learning.

The work of Bill Patrick as Mis-
ter Zero surpassed many a per-
formance of an actor on the legiti-
mate stage. And the smooth direc-
tion of Mr. Whitehill was reflected
to the audience throughout the en-
tirety of the play.

After ﬁve years of life oﬁ? the
campus‘ such. an accomplishment as
this play makes me wish that I too
could once more join the ranks of
progressive students back on the
Pitt campus.

Sincerely,
ED GALBREATH, Ed35.

To Bolster Olsonmen
In Outtloor Meetings

Despite poor weather conditions
the past several days, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh track team has
swelled to its full size for the out-
door workouts at the Stadium.

With the spring handicaps sched-
uled for this Saturday, the squad’s
work is at its season’s heights. The
handicaps, however, merely serve
as a stepping stone for the Ohio
State meet the following Saturday

and the Penn Relays on April 26

and 27.
Strong in Sprints

If the number of topnotch sprint-
ers and quarter mil-ers causes
Panther mentor Carl Olson to con-
centrate on the Penn Relays and
forget foregoing events, it won’t be
surprising, because his squad’s po-
tentialities make opposing coaches
pin their hopes on scoring heavily
in other events.

Just who will be the three 100
and 220—yard dash men leaves plen-
ty of room for argument. Happy
Stickel and Bullet Bill Carter would
seem to have the posts cinched were
it not that Larry Tregjoning and
l.7ranl«: Ohl have both returned.

Carter and Stickel opened the
eyes of fans and coaches all around
the winter indoor circuit, but Tre-
goning and Ohl were lettermen and
ICAAAA. place wi.nners last year.

Anderson Improves

Eventually Olson.’s probable so-
lution will find one of the latter vet-
erans in the quarter in dual tests.
Still, one of a trio of great 44-0--men
will have to give way. Clyde Graf,
Al McKee and Al Ferrara compris-
ed the dual meet two-furlor.-g entry
in 1939, and all three return. to the
cinder path.

Graf or l\/l'cKee will have to run
the 880 which both have attempted
with fair success. Both have enough
speed to show up most half-milers,
hut may give way to Del Anderson,
the most improved man on the
squad.

Jones, Johnson Blow Early Leads
As Panthers Drop Four Straight

By John Chaffo
Poor pitching: and a weak clcfeiisc were the chief .i:'ea.~.:oiis for
Pitt"s i:'our straiglit dc-teats at the liands of Soutliorn liaschall op-

ponents last week.

Tlie Pantliers proved. niorc than woblily in the field as they
consistentl,v fumbled and kicked the ball around.

Perliaps the

weakest spots in the Pitt (l9f€‘llS(} were first base, shortstop, and

third base.

In their opener the Panther nine
displayed ﬁne baseball at times but
this was offset by a number of mis-
cues. Edgar Jones, highly touted
hurler, took the mound for the Mit-
terling team and had the Dukemen
fairly well stumped until he de-
veloped a streak of wildness. Poor
ﬁelding support further aided the
lrzlue Devils in overtaking the
Panthers and winning 10-9.

Pitt outhit the Durham squad as
they gathered 13 hits off pitcliers
lV.CC.'-.1l‘lD, Bortz, and Proth:o. The
winning Blue Devils succeeded in
reaching Jones for only seven safe-
ties. '

Wake Forest duplicated the feat
of Duke when they also overcame
an early Pitt lead to win 9-8. Up
until the last inning the Panthers
held the upper hand, but a two-run
rally on Andy Johnson and Joe
Trcolo wiped out their margin. The

game was called because of dark-
ness after seven. frames.

Although they were defeated in
their first two engagements, the
Panthers had high hopes as they
traveled to the University of Vir-
ginia. However, the Pitt nine was
completely routed. as they dropped
a 19-5 decision to the Virginians.

Previous to the Maryland game,
coach Ralph Mitterling attempted to
shake off the losing streak by jug-
gling his inﬁeld. To first he sent
Ci-uy Guadagnino in place of Lefty
Drobniiski, and at shortstop he used
third baseman Bob Foliart. In place
of Foliart at third l\/[itterling decid-
ed to alternate footballer Ernie Bon-
elli and Snuffy Hughes.

This bit of strategy proved fruit-
less, however, as the Panthers were
whitewashed 14-0. Johnson went
the route for the losers, as his team'-
i"-Aates were charged with 14 errors.
.Pit‘t managed to escape being held
l:..it.less when lcft.ﬁ.elder Frank Goelz
connected for a two-base hit.

Mitterling immediately began
preparations for the coming home
debut with Indiana State Teachers
college. The Pitt squad will be
drilled consid~erably outdoors in an
attempt to eliminate the defensive
flaws.

Coach Grady Produces Squad

Of Champions in First Season

Completing his first year as head
man of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s varsity splash team, Coach
Ben Grady can boast of a record
seldom attained by first year
coaches.

The Cathedral boys got off to an
unhealthy start in two non-league
meets at -the beginning of the sea-
son. The Ohio State spl-ashers hand-
ed the Panthers their initial defeat,
35-20, and in a meet at Buffalo the
University of Michigan’s mermen,
splashed out a 51-21 win.

l-Iowever, these meetings provid-
ed the local swimmers with the
necessary spark to finish the season
undrefeated in league competition,
lj-esides establishing themselves as
.1940 Eastern Collegiate champions.

Grady’s mermen completely dom-
inated proceedings in the Eastern
Collegiate meet at Lancaster. En-
tering the meet as deﬁnite favor-
ites, the local lads made sure of not
disappointing any of their support-
ers.

mph’ Girl Declines

Ann Sheridan Refuses C&G Lead

Another publicity bubble burst
yesterday when Ann Sheridan,
America’s “oomph” girl, declined
the offer of Robert Crooks, BA40,
production manager of Cap and
Gown’s “Snap Your Fingers,” to ac-
cept the feminine lead_ in the 1940

iproductionwhich will be staged in

the Nixon theater the
April 29.

Miss Sheridan declined because of
“previous commitments to make
pictures during April and May.” V

In a telegram dated Friday,
March 29, sent to Miss Sheridan.
Crooks contradicted the opinion of
l.-}*’arvard undergraduates who voted
Miss Sheridan the screen actress
“most unlikely to succeed” by stat-
ing “. we are convinced that
they are no judges (of talent or beau-
ty’? and invited her to accept the
role of Hedy LaMoney in the show.

After questioning, Cap and Gown
publicity director E..Seymour Ker-
ber, C41, readily admitted that the
telegram invitation was a publicity
stunt, but that the timing of the
news release with the opening of
Miss Sheridan’s latest moving pic-
ture downtown was "merely coin-
cidental-:”

With the initial performance of
“Snap Your Fingers” for the Shrin-
ers at the Syria Mosque only two
weeks away, Charles Hergenroeder,
C-40, business manager, announced
that ticket exchange for University
