proposals for the Congress

meeting last Wednesday, the com‘''-
mittee "will present the points at
the ﬁrst SC meeting ofthe school

The first.of these proposals is an
al1—school blood drive, and the sec-.
ond is the selection of a beauty

ball tournament this December.
If the blood drive issue is passed

5 dollars. _‘

The bus will leave from the’
Cathedral, Saturday morning
at 6 a.m., and will return im-
mediately ‘following the game.

today, it is planned that SC would
stage the drive in cooperation with
the ROTC groups here at Pitt.
Previously, the Army and Air
Force ROTC sponsored a blood
drive but this would be the first
all-school drive in some time.

With Pitt playing in the Ken-
tucky All—American City Basket--
ball Tournament this December,
Kentucky Wesleyan College, host
school of the tourney, has invited
SC to enter a beauty queen in a
contest they are having.

If SC passes the project today,
all organizations on campus would
be invited to enter a girl of their
choice. The winner of this number
would be selected and her pic-

college queens, will be sent to »

came. to the top of the class and
those who became officers, were
fraternity men. P i r

reason for»this is _that fraternity
life develops early leadership by

A poll was taken to obtain students’ opinions on the new
magazine, the “Omnibus,” which came out last Tuesday.
The general results showed that. there is a need for more
_ articles on life at the University. There was also a demand

. for more humor in the magazine.

Richard Cromie, Col. ’57: “On the surface it seems to
be a good magazine representing the student body. How-
ever, some factions of student lifee '
seem to be left out. Reli ious .

Tamhuritzans Enj oy Summer

Midwestern Tour
Proves Glamor of

Work in Show Biz

By CAROLYN STASENKO

As the saying‘ goes, “There’s
no business like show busi-
ness,” and that takes in any-
‘thing from a broadway run
of “Guys and Dolls” to an
amateur performance of

“Seventeenth Summer.” The so-
phisticated cynics in sunglasses
may still insist it only looks glam-
orous but it is really hard work
with littlereward.

The All -University Tamburit—
zans, directed by Matt Gouze,
strongly disagree. The “Tammies”
have ‘just returned from a- sum-

mer of training and traveling_

throughout the Midwest with their
new show, and they’ve discovered
that show business, even on a col-
lege level, holds all the enjoy-—
ment that »the most stat-ry—eyed
kid thinks it does. »

' Gouze, who was born in Minne-
sota and there originated the Tam-

buritza idea, has gained a repu_ta- -

tion . for top-notch. entertainment
throughout the Midwest. The Tam-
buritzans were treated royally at
every stop from Minnesota “ to
"Michigan. '
Use Tamburitza

The ensemble, with most of the
members coming from Pitt, derives
its name from their chieﬂy used
instrument, the tamburitza, fore-
runner of the mandolin. This in-
strument, however, is supplement-
ed by the use of»,a very modern
swing and sway combo of saxa-
phone, accordion, trumpet, and
drums. ‘

The show itself features plenty
_ of Pitt talent. Soloist Sandra Pe-
Vdltika, Col. '58, sings Croatian
love songs-—both the gay, ﬂirta-
tious kind and the soft, lullaby
type. Soprano Annemarie Baller,
Col. '58, sings a haunting orien-
tal style song, “Moj Dilbere.”
‘Jerry Ruzbecki, Eng. ’59, who
doesn’t let a heavy accordion stop
him from dancing, usually accom-
panies his playing with a few live-
v1y/ polka steps. Ruzbecki joins
' Terry Gouze, Col. ’59, for a snappy.
Yugoslavian folk dance.

Fair Practice Enhanced

in the legislature places the Commonwealth among
such states as New York, New Jersey, Massachu-
setts and Rhode Island which have long effected

successful programs.

House and Senate leaders agreed last Wednes-

day upon the establishment of
a nine—man ‘Fair Employment
Practices Commission. Members
accepted the controversial Flem-
ing Amendment, which prohibits

discrimination because of age, as 

well as race, religion or color.

‘discrimination in employment‘ but the necessary

The controversial ‘_‘age” amendment, although
it hardly seems akin to the original purpose of the
FEP-, tends to point-out‘ the complete absurdity at

to make statistics. Because of individual inherent
traits which one possesses at birth, many. people
have been similarly badgered.

Now the worth of FEP lies not in that it can

prove to~ be
one with “teeth,” fully enforceable. The only ac-
ceptable reasons for refusal’ for employment must
be based on ( 1) a bonaﬁde occupational qualiﬁca-
tion, and (2) Sec_urity regulations established by
either the United States or Pennsylvania govern-

on occasions.

This accomplishes little with the large employer and’
probably more to embitter the small man. Rather it

members to exhort employers to “try” personnel of

But the necess_ity of an FEP in Pennsylvania
must make us vitally pognizant that prejudice and
bigotry is not only‘ a characteristic of Mississippi.

show our prejudices, you in the North hide them.” I

It certainly is true when we realize Negroes

ing school under the GI Bill comes
in November; I applied to start

family problem has come up. Will
I be able to get in under the
Korean GI Bill, since my deadline
will have passed?

Answer—No. Under the law,
a veteran actually must begin
his Korean GI training before
his starting deadline. Filing an
application alone is not sufficient
and the law grants no excep-
tions. I

,plied to VA for disability com-
pensation about two years_ago,
then failed to report for a phys-
ical examination when he was ask-
ed. He now would like to reopen
his claim. Is it too late?

Answer-—It is too late to re-
open the o1'iginal claim, since
VA considers that claims are
abandoned when the veteran
takes no action to comply with
VA’s request “within a me-year
period.» However, the veteran
may ﬁle a new application. If he
does. and it it is approved. his

Panthers Down;
Are They Out?

By GENE AROMATORIO
Sports Editor

_yardage that the- Blue and Gold

There are seven games left on the Pitt schedule-—enough
games to make the Panthers one of the top teams in the coun-
try and certainly the best in the East. And yet, these same

"seven games could turn out to show us as just another

football team. -

Which it will be is pretty much up to us: we hold the
answer, not‘ our opponents. After seeing the Oklahoma game
Saturday, I’m convinced that John Michel0sen’s gridders are capable
of beating the rest of the teams remaining on the schedule. But
will they?

Before Saturday’s game the question was, “How good is Pitt?
The Panthers gave the answer against the Sooners Saturday——
damn good. Now the question is, “Do the Panthers have the
stuff it takes to face the toughest schedule in college football,
starting. this Saturday at Navy, or will they be the team to fold
when the dark clouds come into sight?” ‘

We won’t know till Saturday but maybe we can speculate a
little now. This Pitt team Saturday showed fans something that no
Pitt team showed at any time last year, and that "is the ability to
come from way behind to almost win a ballgame that was lost by
halftime.’ ' ’

Last year one of the very“ noticeable things about the. Panther
eleven was the ease with which their spiritwas broken. It seemed
that if a break went against the Panthers that led to an opponent
touchdown, the boys -from Skyscraper .U. threw in the sponge and
merely went through the motions for the remainder of the -game.

This fact (showed itself in many of the games last year; es-
pecially against Notre Dame. Early in the Irish clash a couple of
miscues by the officials hurt the Panthers seriously. A quick
whistle prevented Panther possession of Joe Heap’s fumble deep
 territory. Also, the oﬁicials failed to notice that the’
 receiver ' caught Carey’s touchdown pass. with one foot out
of the end zone. ' ’

These two breaks that went against the Panthers proved to be
too niuch for the gridders’ spiritand after that they merely played
the clock and not the Irish. Result: Notre Dame 33,. Pitt 0. '

This same type of spirit was evident in the Minnesota game
when the Panthers were humiliated 46-7 by the Gophers—a team
not ten points better than the,Panthers were. The cause of the rout
was simple; Pitt got behind a touchdown or two and then laid down
while the Gophers ran over them, around them, and through them.
Waiting for the ﬁnal buzzer again. i

This is the kind of spirit that winning football teams lack
and this is the very spirit that the Panthers have had none of
thustfar this season. In three games Michelosen’s boys have been

Against the Sooners, the Panthers were considered ﬁnished at
the half: behind 19-0 at halftime against possibly the best team in
the country—a team that, even more so than the Panthers, ‘is con-
sidered as a strong second—ha/if team. -‘ 2 ' '

So, with everyone," counting them out (except they, themselves)
the Blue and Gold-clad" gridmen came out on the ﬁeld in the second
quite a while by any Panther team. ,« ,

The fans who had already counted them out early in the
game now sat close-mouthed and watched the boys from "Pitt
take charge. With less ammunition to work withea weaker line

If there‘ was anyone worrying more than the Oklahoma fans
it was Wilkinson and his gridders. Luckily, for _them, the Sooners
were able to hold the Panthers on their, last serious attempt and
force them to punt. From there the Sooners kept possession and ﬁnally

Whitewash Covies 
In Breezing to Opening Victory

  

 

Opening the season with a 15-50 shutout of Geneva at
the Schenley Park Course Saturday afternoon, the Panther
harriers showed strong promise of once again being a power-
house of cross-country running. V

The win, the locals’ ‘eighteenth consecutive dual-meet

victory in a string extending over three seasons, was ac-

complished in a more—or-less routine manner with the Covies

never in contention from the start.

The good condition of the 4.3
mile trail and the near-perfect
weather enabled Coach Carl Ol-
son’s proteges to reel off times
which indicated that they were
close to mid-season form.

Sowell First
Leading the blue and gold pa-
rade to the tape was the Panther
captain, feather - striding Arnie
Sowell, who broke the string in
the very good time of 22:31:13. Five
