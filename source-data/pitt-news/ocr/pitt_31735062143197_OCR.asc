Players Have
Reconversion
Difficulties

The national government isn‘t
the only organization that is being
plagued with reconversion head-
aches these days. The Pitt Play-
ers, preparing for their coming
production, “Playtime,”_~ are also
running into their share of recon-
version dilﬁculties.

Taking into consideration the
shortage of material for sets,
President Ivan Birsic chose two
plays, “Happy Journey” and “Our
Town,” which require very little
scenery. The “House of Jukes,”
however, calls for an elaborate
setting. .

Chief set designer Dick McCar-
thy’s first problem was to replace
the Players’ depleted stock of
tools, canvas, paint, and lumber.
Requisitions were ﬁled for these
materials, but they were slow in
coming through and the “show
must go on.” From their homes
the stage hands brought their own
hammers, saws, and paint brushes.
In order to speed up the painting
pi-rocess, Dave Barbour, the tech-
nical manager, converted an old
ﬁre extinguisher into a paint
spray-gun, which now does the
work in half the original time.

The biggest headache in stag-
ing “Our Town” and .“Happy
Journey” is being borne by the
lighting director, Jim Voris. These
two plays are being produced
with a minimum of scenery, and
it’s Jim’s duty to make the lack
of scenery unnoticeable to the au-

ing effects. Jim has made over all
the lighting equipment used in the
Cap and Gown show “Kilroy was
Here” so that it will be suitable

for - “Playtime.” .

For the ﬁrst time in many months Pitt has an opportunity

through the University Soap Box of the Air to participate in
radio work." In the ﬁeld of radio we are, it is true, years be-

hind other universities and colleges——schools that boast, not,

only complete courses of study in radio engineering, produc-
tion, writing and dramatics, but miniature radio stations for
use aspractical “1abs.’.’ * .

University ofﬁcials are planning future radio courses here
and possible collaboration on a large scale with big city sta-
tions. ‘ ‘ . ’ ~ H

. These plans may soon turn into a reality. In the meaiitime,
the WWSW-Post—Grazette Soapbox of the Air is olfering a
chance for Pitt students, interested in radio wprk, as well as
students from other local schools, to getia bit of experience
under their belts—experience that is even more necessary for
success than in other fields. 4 0

Tonight, the premiere broadcast of the weekly feature will

be made, and Pitt will be represented by student speaker Thomas

J. Skifﬁngton. Participation in future broadcasts is not limited
to any set-group of students. Anyone is eligible. All students
who are interested in broadcasting are urged to talk to Mr.
‘Buell Whit.ehi1l,‘assistant professor of speech. A

, Prc--iRegistration Causes
  Chaos in Commons Room

by Frank Langsdale

Approximately 800 students stampeded across the Commons room
early yesterday morning in an attempt to be among the ﬁrst to reg-
ister under the new pre-registration system. After the ﬁrst few
minutes, the masses organized themselves into lines and quieted down.

Opinions of the new system ran from,‘ “It’s lousy,” to “It’s really

fa swell system, a lot better than the last semester.”

Some of the ﬁrst students in line were Sherwin Zalman, Alan
Rosenberg, Irene Marcus, and Pe- ‘
ter J. Mc-Guire, who claimed he to the A-B—C table and just got
there as the crowd started to
break.” '

To the spurious claims that
cards had been removed from
piles previous to arrival, Mr.
Batchelder explained that only

M arfy Lou Fitzimmons Wins“
Owl’ s “Door Prize” Radio

Santa Claus in January? Sounds impossible, but it’s not-at

least, that-’s the way Mary Lou Fitzimmons feels about it. She is the
proud owner of a shiny new RCA Victor radio, and her belated Kris

Kringle is the 1947 Oﬂ staff. Miss Fitzimmons is the lucky winner

A radios

of the Owl drawing held this week.
As publicity for its subscription drive, the yearbook staff, under
the direction of Circulation Manager Lucille Zuerner, gave away two

1947 table model radios; one, thee

RCA Victor, to an Owl subscriber,
and the other, a. Philco, to the
staﬁ member who sold the most
Owl subscriptions. .

Harry Lentchner, of the busi-

ness staff, won the Philco model

by selling 180 ‘Owls, while stati-
member John Pager was second
with 157 sales and Bob Graham
third with 135.

The drawing was made by Stu-
dent Publications Director William
McElw_ain, who pulled the winning
stub from a box containing names
of 1450 subscribers. This year’s
Owl showed a sale increase of al-
most 90% over the 1946 book, and

-Miss .Zuerner believes that the

publicity gained in offering t-he

radio prizes helped the subscrip-

tion drive immeasurably.

Throughout the campaign, the
were exhibited in the
ground floor booths, and students
had an opportunity to hear them
“in action.”

Miss Fitzimmons, when she
learned she was the student win-
ner, exclaimed, “This is one of
the nicest Christmas presents I

received, even if it didn’t come

until January!”

Two Rifle Teams
Choose Captains

Keen competition has tempor-
arily delayed the ngining of the
ﬁrst teams of both the ROTC and
varsity riﬂe squads.

The team captains, however,
have been decided. They are El-
liot Carter of the,» varsity and
Harry Herlingex of the ROTC.

Both of these men have been the-

crack mar.-_smer. of their respec-
tive squads the last two seasons.
Theywill wind up their college
careers this year, since riﬂemen
can ﬁre for only three vears.

On Nov. 29, 1946, the faculty
committee of athletics approved
the awarding of varsity letters to
David Berkart, Elliot Carter,
Harry Herlinger, and Louis Kish.

The riﬂe season is scheduled to
open on Saturday with 82 ROTC

and 49 Varsity matches on tap.

Riflemen Wanted

partment again requests that all
those interested report to the rifle
range as soon as possible.

tory over. the Sharpsburg Y last
Wednesday, in a Metropolitan Y

garne although their lead was
 more than three points at
the end of any quarter.

The accurate shooting of Galiffa
and Gallagher and the bal1-hand-
ling of Shumaker also played.‘ a
major role in the Pitt victory.
Galiffa‘scored ten points and Gal-
lagher eight. ‘ -

Panthers Meet Weakiti  
Bethany Bison Five

   

 

Geneva Bests

Pitt 57-56 .

Pitt faltered in the late stages
Saturday night, and despite a des-
perate last-minute rally dropped
a 57-56 decision to Geneva’s
Covenanters. -

Geneva gained a two-point edg
halfway through the ﬁnal canto
and increased it to 57-51,,with a
minute remaining. A free throw,
followed by two quick ﬁeld goals
.closed the gap to 57-36, but Gen-
eva held on to cop its ﬁrs‘; victory
from the Panthers in nine at-
tempts.

As usual Pitt led at the ﬁrst
quarter, 14-10, and increased the
advantage one point to top the
Covenanters at the intermission,
30-25.

But failure at the foul line hurt
the Carlsonmen. They missed 11
out of 27 free throws.

Herb Douglas To Run
Against “Mr. Outside”

Herb Douglas, outstanding Pitt
track star, will, resume indoor
competition this year when he
competes in the West Point Re-
lays next Saturday afternoon.

Douglas is an entry in the 60-
yd. dash and broad jump. He will
be opposed in the sprint by Glenn
Davis —— the dashing “Mr. Out-
side” of Army grid fame.

6 Pitt draws a “breather” tomor-

     
         
   
    
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
  
 

row night when Bethany’s Bisons .
hie in from West Virginia. ‘With ,
the exception of Carnegie Tech,
the Bisons should be the Panthers’
easiest foe to date.

After dropping three gamesgto
Geneva, Westminster, and W &'J,
the Bisons bumped California
Teachers, 58-54. They split the
next two, shading Glenville, 50?
49 and losing to Mariet‘ta,‘52-49.
They rank directly behind Pitt
in district standings. 1

Last year Pitt ,won a crushing
67-36 victory. In ﬁve previous
meetings between the two, Betha-
ny has failed_to notch at win.

The Bisons will send McWhirter
and Mewharten at the forwards.
Ex-Brentwood high school per-
former, Perry Bowden, holds forth
at center while Dumbaugh and
Grizzell ﬁll in at the guards.
