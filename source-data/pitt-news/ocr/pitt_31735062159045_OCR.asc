Engineering School
Boasts Of Outstanding
Refrigeration Courses
By HARRISON CHANDLER
An important factor in the
rapid gain in national recogni-
tion and prest.ig-c of the Univer-

its outstanding courses in re-
i:'rigeration and air-eondition-
iug, newest. of engineering sci-
cnces.

“One of the best equipped
college refrigeration laboratories
in the country” was the comment
of Dr. E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
School of Engineering, upon his
recent inspection of the Univer-
sity’s refrigeration laboratory in
the Automotive-Highway building,
near Trees gym.

The laboratory houses the most
complete collection of small do-
mestic refrigeration units to be
found, according to F. H. Steining,
a well known specialist in the
ﬁeld of air condit‘oning and re-
frigeration who teaches courses
here in these ﬁelds.

Domestic Course

The University’s School of En-
gineering is the only one which of-
fers a course in domestic refriger-

ation in its entirety, Steining
 Most engineering schools
give instruction only on large

commercial machines, too large
for students to tea: down and ex-
amine. l

Under Steining’s direction the
University was also one of the
first schools to offer a modern air-
conditioning course, which is not
to be confused with heating and
\'eiitil:itii1g courses.

J

Problems of students in pres-
ent-day society will be dis-
cussed today at Inquiry Forum
by Dr. Jesse llolnies, professor
of pliilosophy at Swartluuore
college. l'nquir_\f meets at 12 :30
o’clock in 129 C.‘ath.e<.lral.

“Studeitts in a Cliaiigiiig
World” is the topic chosen by Dr.
Holmes, who is noted as a student
of social trends in America. In
his position at Svarthmore, which
he has held for over 30 years, Dr.
Holmes became recognized as a
leader in the ﬁeld of social edu-
cation.

to Work.”

The labcvratory equipment in-,
cludes various experimental units 1
which were both designed and!
built in he University laboratory. 3
Among these are several devices;
on which Steining holds patents. E

Through his wide connections
with the refrigeration industry,
Steining has secured for the labor-
atory not only current models but
also a great number of the older
types of electric and gas refrigera-
tors, enabling students to follow
the development of the industry.
In this way he is also able to dem-
onstrate to them new equipment
long before it is placed on the
market for public sale. ‘

Jobs Available j

Every year a considerable num--?«
ber of University engineering:
graduates find jobs in the refrig- 
eration industry, Steining said. At 
the present time the University is 5
represented in every m€1l01‘ 00m‘
pany of this kind. ,

Steining, who came to the Uni- ,:
versity in 1923, introduced and'
personally developed the courses‘
in refrigeration and air-condition-
ing here. In addition to his duties
at the University, he is the man-
ager of the refrigeration division
of a prominent Pittsburgh com-
pany.

He has also done considerabale
work in the air-conditioning in-
dustry. In spite of all the talk
about air-conditioned homes, there .
are very few today, he disclosed.
Severay important engineering
problems must be solved before
“comfort cooling” equipmeflt Can
be installed in private homes to
any great extent. He is inclined to
doubt whether people need hu-
miclitv in the air in their homes
 badly as some air-conditioning
companies would have them be-
lieve.

He is nationally known as an in-

has the knack of putting complex
ideas simply,” says William W’.
Mondenhall, executive secretary
of the YMCA.

The comparatively large per-
centage of Rhodes scholars which
has come from Swarthmore col-

of Dr. Holmes’ training, according
to Mr. Mendenhall.

Dr. Gabbert will travel in the
;West. He will leave Pittsburgh

late this week.
Department heads of the Col-

To Library i

by Pi Tau Phi

At the regular monthly meeting
of Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic
fraternity in the College, held last
Thursday at Cathedral Mansions,
Kenneth Kneebone, treasurer of
the organization, announced that
the University Libi" :y had order-

ec the books which the fraternity 4

had voted to present to the Uni-
versity at its December meeting.
The titles are mostly recent

books which could not be included ?

in departmental appropriations,

but whose need was felt by the

members of the various depart-
The frater-
nity authorized the committee to
set a maximum of 30 dollars, and
to select the titles accordingly.

The move is unprecedented in‘
the history of Pi Tau Phi, but the '

present membership voted for the
appropriation in the hope that it
set a precedent, to be fol-
lowed after their graduation.

When the books are received by .

the library, they will be placed on
a separate shelf, unless it becomes
apparent that they will best serve
their purpose by being included in
the regular library collection.

Two Chinese funeral urns dec-
orated with dragons and imita-
tions of the immortals were re-
cently placed in the department of
fine arts through the efforts of
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women.

The urns were presented by
Margaret Montiro, former Univer-
sity student who has spent consid-
erable time in ‘China. Excavated
from an old cemetery in North
China, the urns offer an interest-
ing insight into the traditional
customs and beliefs of the Chi-
nese people. The custom of plac-
ing food with the dead for use on
the journey to the next world,
dates back to prehistoric times.

lryourt Dates
For New Play

Pitt Players have selected the

dates of March 2 and 3 for their
presentation of “Accent on Youth”
in the Stephen Foster Memorial.
_ Deﬁnite work on the play, how-
’?ever, will not be started until the
new semester opens. By then, Di-
rector Carl Cass expects to have
arranged his schedule with regard
to the Players show and the Cap
and Gown production.

The Players were originally

;Gown show was to be given in
él\«iarch. However, the Players
ltraded dates with the male mu-
isical show when it was found the
Nixon theater was avail:->.ble in
April, and not in March.

?Players show is scheduled for
March, tryouts for new members

An Honorary
Becomes Activated

l TAU PHI, honorary fraternity for higli

scholastic achievement, has shown a com-
mendable interest in learning at the l7niver—
sity by donating money for purchase of new
books by the library.

It it unfortunate that, due to its restricted
budget, the library has not been able to keep
up with all the latest works of vital concern
to students and faculty, especially tliose pub-
lications in the social sciences, especially those
which department heads consider important.

Pi Tau Phi’s action was ‘motivated by the
hope that other groups on campus would fol-
low suit. ,Here is a definite opportunity for
those organizat'ions—-—we’re sure some do exist
——which have been stumped for an outlet for
the dues they have collected through the
years.

staff; if they agree The News will second Pi

James Cain in his treatment of the
itinerant workers, cattle hands,

the life-blood of his novels.

To Steinbeck, the forgotten man
is the essentially introverted, the

partially obscuring the subtle as-

the humblest is constantly search-

rabbits and mice he loved to pet.
Candy, the old roustabout with
the smelly dog, and Crooks, the
embittered negro wanted to live
out their days on the farm that
was never to rise above their

They were all going to “live off

who just couldn’t resist mice, and
rabbits, and the soft hair of Cur-
ly’s wife personiﬁed the hopeless-
ness and futility of their desire.

Mice and M en

Of Mice and Men is probably
best representative of Steinbeck’s
work. Tortilla Flat is lacking in
the sociological and proletarian im-
plications of Of Mice and Men,
and Of Dubious Battle, although
continuing in the same vein as
Of Mice and Men, suffers in com-
parison with the more sensation-
ial story of George and Lennie.

Those who have read 03‘ Mice

and Lennie for a long time. They
will remember them not only for
the social preachment which they
imply, but also for the quality of
the peculiar friendship which ex-
isted between the two.

Sound and Fury

By JAMES R. DONOGHUE

After August, 1914, most of the peoples of ’s‘.v'cstern Europe
were divided into two hostile camps. The adherents oi‘ one side
claimed that they were the custodians of culture and that they
were ﬁgliting to prevent domination by the other side, a domi-
nation which would spell the end of civilization.

Odd enough, the other side claimed the same thing.

It

was pretty much a case of “pay your money and take your

choice.’ '

Twenty some yea—rs later, one can with some hope of ac-

curacy cast up the accounts and¢

aver that both sides were partly
right and partly wrong, after the
fashion of humankind; and that
one can’t say that either was any
more right or wrong than the
other. Both were tarred with the
same brush and smeared with the
same feathers, so that in the end
one’s estimation of the rightness
or the wrongness of the conclu-
sion of the conflict is derived, not
from right reason but from what
one‘s prejudgement predisposes
him to.

IN THIS YEAR of our Lord,
1938, the samesituation, described
no more adequately by new terms
rehashe-cl from old, has made its
appearance. The fight today is

said to be one of the “democratic I

nations against the warring dic-
tatorships.”

Cod Rest Us .

I have argued as loudly as the
next man. and shall probably con-
tinue to argue, that I do not like
dictatorships —— and for purely

ual, however tacitly, to be pro-
foundly sceptical of the claim that
the people of any one age are ever

presented with a decision of irre-
gvocable import to this sadly-spin-

 ning globe.

We shall find. I think—-that is,

3 those of us who live will find it, we
the essence of the hopes, the frus- ?

care to gather up the deposits of
truth on the road to Progress—
that there was not any ﬁnal sort
of justice on either side of the
lineup of nations in 1938; that
mad as we judged them to be,
Japan and Italy and Germany had
as much cause to ﬁght as their
antagonists. These nations were
incredibly poor; they were in a
state, practically speaking, of na-
tional starvation, and even if mis-

guided, made a game fight to live
as they believed human beings
should live. And. too, they fought
against nations that were older
and more experienced. as well as
richer, abler, and of greater num-
bers.

Let’s Blame the System

As was the case with the
World War, what seemed so terri-
bly true in the midst of it all
turned out later to be rather
nightmares of truth, neither side
being in a position to wear the
shining armour of justice, eternal
and immutable.

The historians, as is their wont,
blamed it on the system. And I
from sheer fatigue am forced to
agree with them.

Tonight In Stadium

Pantliers Engage
In C.onference,.
Infra-City Tilt

. By S. S. KALWARY

The respective baskets of Pitt
and Carnegie Tech will be under
severe ﬁre in the Stadium court
tonight. as both quints complete
the first-round City Conference
skirmishes, and the Panthers open
the title defense of the Eastern
Conference.

W ednesda): and Friday evenings
the Carlsonmen trade goals with
even stiffer competition-——Notre
Dame and Georgetown. Add to,

the hoopmen are not excluded
V from the unholy mid-semester ex-
amination period. which plants its
gloom on the Oakland campus the
smog-lifting morning of the Hoya
encounter, and your sympathies
will be directed to, and not at all
wasted on, the Panther basketball-
ers.
HOME DATES

All of these contests, for a
change, are to be staged on the
home lot. The “Pullman Passers”
of Pitt. favor home games, but at

ruif, half mile. Each will prob-
ably do better this year.

Johnny '~.Voodruif will try to
lower the time on the quarter
mile in addition to his half mile
specialty. ‘Someone can go for an
eraser now and start work on re-
moving the time for these heats
because this seems to be J ohnny’s

propelled farther than heretofore.

can put the shot with enough ﬁn-
esse and eclaire to Cause 21 119W

FOUR JUMPERS

The broad jump record will face
a four-man assault. Ed Rouch,
present record holder, will lead
the attack. Frank Ohl, Frank
Kristi, and Pete Bennet can 3150
leap through the air, and may flut-
jump Rouch. Frank Kristi IS a
threat for the high hurdle mark,
and if not successful here, he may
push Ken Ryden into a high
hurdle record.

Only the mile, two-mile run,
and pole vault records are reason-
ably safe, And, unless some sur-
prises or track dark horses put 1n
an appearance, the freshmen rec-
ords will get by unscathed until
next year.

Article. On Collembolae

Collembolae, honorary natural
science fraternity, takes the spot-
light in the January issue of the
Alumni Review, official publica-
tion of the General Alumni Asso-
ciation.

February 14 will mark the fif-
teenth anniversary of the found-
ing of the fraternity, and in con-
nection with this event William
Charlesworth. C38, president of
the group, has written an article
which tells the history of this or-
ganization.

Originally former as a natural
science club in 1923, Collembolae
took its name from a tiny wing-
less insect called “Collembola,”
which a group of University stu-
dents had been studying at the
biological laboratory at Cold
Springs Harbor, Long Island, in
,the summer of 1922. Three years
Sago Collembolae became an offi-
icially recognized honorary frater-
lnity.

VARIED ACTIVITIES

Activities in Collembolae are
varied. Members have taken ﬁeld
trips which have covered much of
the territory in Western Pennsyl-
vania. Charlesworth’s article is
illustrated with photographs taken
on several of these trips.

Twice monthly during the
school year Collembolae hold din-
ner meetings. This fraternity al-
so has given scholarships which
provide for a summer’s work to 12
students at the Cold Springs Har-
bor laboratory.

The list of names of past presi-

By GEORGE HYDE 3

dents of Collembolae and their
present positions reveals that all
now are doing outstanding work
in some division of the ﬁeld of
science.

Of interest to engineers will be
“The Young Man Looks Into En-
gineering,” by E. A. I-Iolbrook,
clean of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines. Mr. Holbrook’s ar-
ticle, another in the series inter-
preting divisions of the University
which the Alumni Review has
been presenting, is a comprehen-
sive survey of the purpose and
aims of the school of Engineering
and Mines.

FOOTBALL REVIEW

The Alumni Reviey closes the
1937 chapter of the University’s
championship football team with
an account of the honors bestow-
ed on the members of the team
and Dr. Sutherland. A review of
the Panthers encounters with No-
braska, Penn State, and Duke is
also presented.

With an article entitled “Pitts-
burgh Sports in Snowtime,” the
Review turns to the winter sports
program of the University, and
surveys the prospects of the bas-
ketball, indoor track, boxing,
swimming, and wrestling teams.

Also in this issue is an article
on Dr. Charles R. Foster, distin-
guished alumnus and educator,
who died December 14, and an ar-
ticle on maturity of mind by Dr.
Richard Hope, associate professor
of philosophy.

League Moguls
Draw-Up Plans
For Cup Rounds 5

With practically a full season
still ahead of them, the Ohio-
P e n n s y l Vania Intercollegiate
Hockey League moguls have al-
ready formulated plans for the cli-
maxing playoffs and have them
safely stored away for use some
two months hence.

Walter Good, former track ace
and at present assistant to Jimmy
Hagan, has been handling hockey

office and explained h.ockey’s
screwy playoffs to your corre-
spondent in the following manner.
TWO DIVISIONS

In the first place, points for
wins and ties determine the stand-
ings throughout the playing sea-
son. Two points for a win and
one for a tie.

The Western division, compris-
ing teams representing Penn Col-
lege, John Carrol, Western Re-
serve and Baldwin-‘Wallace, and
the Eastern division made up of
Tech, Duquesne and Pitt will de-
cide the two top teams in each di-
vision by this cumulative scoring
method.

Following the regular season the
pair of top teams in each division
will meet and the survivors will
ﬁnally clash in a two—game series
for the championship.

Total scores for both games
with the toga going to the high
scorers is the deciding factor in
the series. The first ﬁnal game
will be played in Cleveland with
Pittsburgh playing host in the
ﬁnal clash.

CUPS DONATED

A prominent Cleveland paper
has donated a trophy for the West-
ern division champion and Johnny
Harris and Al Sutphen have colla-
borated to furnish the Intercolleg-
iate Champs with a cup. As yet
no cup has been donated for the
Eastern leaders, but one it is ru-
mored will be forthcoming very
soon.

With their eyes focused on an
Eastern Championship and most
important for the time being the
John Carrol tilt on Wednesday,
John McSorley’s Pitt pucksters
are rapidly approaching their
peak.

McSor1ey’s announcement that
there would in all probability be
new faces in his starting lineup
has perked the boys up no end.

Congratulations!

INCE THIS is the ﬁrst opportunity which the Pitt Evening Ses-
sion News has had to comment on the Harvest Festival Party
held at the Hotel Schenley Ballroom last November 7, the staff

wishes to state that it was gratifying to everyone who attended to sec ,3
the response of the student body to the party. The president of the 
Evening Students’ Association, Paul J. Hanna, and his associates, de-
serve a great deal of credit for the success they made of the dance.

Mr. Hanna, during a recent meeting "of the ESA, announced that
because of the overwhelming number of evening students that at-
tended the last party and dance, necessitating an expenditure far,
above that anticipated, certain changes in the plans for the coming;f_
social functions of the Evening Students’ Association will be neces-}
sary. A general letter from President Paul J. Hanna, addressed tea
the student body, reprinted below, explains the situation clearly and;
concisely. It is felt that the student body will understand the obsta- =

l

cles which the ESA has met this year, and that the co-operation shown 

at the Harvest Festival will again be evident at the Snow Flake Hop. I

The text of Mr. Hanna’s letter reads as follows:
Dear Fellow Student:

One of the main purposes of the Evening Students’ Association
is to provide social activities for students who attend the Univer-
sity in the evening. * ’

‘Among other events held this year in our attempt to make your
relationship with the University mean more than just classes and
study, a. non-assessment dance was held in Hotel Schenley on Sat-
urday, November 7.

It was our intention to have a series of these dances, for which 6
there would be no charge. However, to be quite frank, the response
to the first dance was so overwhelming that some changes in our
program have been necessitated. The unusually large number who
attended our November party made it necessary for us to rent a
much larger dance floor at the hotel and to provide a larger orches-
tra. This added expense substantially reduced our available funds 3
for subsequent events.

The Evening Students’ Association’s only source of income is a
small appropriation from the University. If we are to continue to
give you the type of entertainment we feel you will enjoy, we shall
have to place an exchange fee of $1.00 on the coupon for the next
dance, the Snow Flake Hop, to be held Friday, January 28. The
dance is scheduled between semesters, when the worries of exam-
inations have passed and before the second semester grind begins.
Your oﬁicers are eager to make this party an enthusiastic and col-
orful event. The Snow Flake Hop will be held in the Hotel Schen-
ley, and it is scheduled to begin at 9 o’clock.

During the week of January 24, upon payment of $1.00,» you
may exchange the coupon in your green Activities Book for two
tickets of admission. This exchange will be made in the Evening
Session Office.

We know that you enjoyed yourself at our Harvest Festival
Dance, and we hope that you will join us at the Schenley on the
28th in our Snow Flake Hop.

Very truly yours,
Paul Hanna, President,
Evening School Association.

in political science.

The Alumni Chapter of the Phi

men’s City Club Tuesday, January
11. Miss Ella Chalfant was the
hostess. Plans for the June Na-
tional Convention, to be held in
Pittsburgh this year, were dis-
cussed at the business meeting
which preceded the party.

A program for the commemora-
tion of the life and works of Rud-
yard Kipling will be held by the
College Alumni Association in the
Social Hall of the Stephen Foster
Memorial Wednesday, January 19,
at 8:30. Mr. J. Lloyd Mahony,
director of the evening division
will be the guest speaker and will
also sing some of Kipling’s lyric
poems. He will be accompanied
on the piano by Mr. Fred Lotz. A

On Friday evening, January 7,
the Pitt Women’s Club held a
bridge party at the Hotel Schen-
ley. Misses Florence Tabor and
Martha Tomar were in charge of
the evening’s activities.

A $25.00 scholarship for next
semester will be awarded to the
two most worthy members of the
Pitt Womens’ Club. These schol-
arships are made possible by the
proceeds from the sandwich stand
in the Lounge, where students
may snatch a bite between classes.

Group Will Continue
Lounge Lunch Counter

The Pitt Women’s Club plans
to continue its lunch counter serv-
ice in the Lounge during the next
semester. This service has been
found to be very successful, and a
great many evening students who
otherwise would go without any-
thing to eat until they reached
home after classes are making use
of this service regularly.

plans for the “Snow Flake Hop,”
to be held at the Hotel Schenley,

Because s u c h overvchelming

the expenses incurred were far

this, it has been thought advisable
to place an exchange fee of one

Joe Ruzza and his orchestra,
