Two students will be selected by Harris
as l2th Man captains. They will spend the
night Downtown with the team, staying in
the Doubletree Hotel with them. They will
follow the team to practice as well as meet-
ings, and will have seats on the sideline
during the game.

The first football game of the season
may not be starting until 3:30 p.m. tomor-
row, but the Pitt Program Council, in con-
junction with the athletics department,.is
kicking off the festivities this afternoon.

Freshmen bust a move to the musical slylings of disc jockey T-Storm.

When it started at 10 p.m., the

if Welcome Home party seemed like

an awkward high school dance. At
10:30 p.m., the line outside Club
Laga stretched to Atwood Street
and the loud "music put on by disc
jockeys Cue and T-Storm from
WAMO radio station began to
gyrate the masses.

Ian Briggs was the master of
‘ceremonies for the event, which
was put together by . Student
Government Board and the fresh-
man peer counselors.

“The idea behind this is to bring
together freshmen and upperclass-
men,” said SGB President Joan
Snyder. “We want to let students
know that we’re planning events.”

Nearly 300 students packed the
nightclub last night, which was free
for Pitt students. Student group

)-

leaders were allowed to register’

their organizations at the door and
plug them onstage during the event.

Around midnight, Anix Vyas
beat-boxed while Tommy Mula
accompanied him with. impromptu
rap lyrics. The duo has been putting
on performances around Oakland
and Vyas has performed nationally.

Snyder added that freshmen can
also expect a Labor Day afternoon
barbecue in Schenley Quadrangle
along with music by the band Good

Brother Earl. The freeevent will be‘

from 4 to 7 p.m. _

“[Pitt] is doing a great job,”
said freshman John Walker, who
was at Club Laga.v"‘When we first
came here, there was stuff to do

every night, if you wanted to.”

College students lured by credit card companies

BRE JONES
The Oracle

  (U-WIRE) TAMPA, Fla. — For new

I ‘college students,‘ just released from their.

parents’ watchful’ eyes, credit card solicitors

. offer a small dose of freedom.

“In my ﬁrst year of college, I acquired
four credit cards and a huge amount of
debt,” said Danielle Richie, a senior still bat-

tling her freshrnan charges. “I didn’t have .
anycredit before I applied. 1 was 18, naive .

and a student. Tl1at’s all it takes.”

The spiral of student over—spending,
whether on Gucci sunglasses or pizza, poses
a major problem in the United States,
according to American Debt Management
Services Incf The average balance on a cred-
it card tops out at $7,000, and the average
interest rate weighs in at 18.9 percent.

“The applicationsare everywhere, and
we want the cards because they mark matu-
rity,” senior Glorianna Felix said. “It’s like
yr/e’re ﬁnally free to buy whatever we want,
without having to ask our parents. We just
go crazy.” '

Ritchie’s ﬁrst application launched her A

collection of plastic money and awarded her
with a teddy bear. Piles of giveaways such
as thermoses, 2—liter bottles of Mountain

Dew, stuffed animals and T-shirts crowd_

application tables.

“I found myself ﬁlling out_applications
just for the free stuﬁ”,” Ritchie said. “Once
the card was in my wallet, I used it in restau-
rants or_for phone bills.”

,_ _ Ritchie isn’t alone. Junior David
Keller’s credit balance swelled with obses-

sivelong distance dialing. When his girl-

friend moved to California, chit-chatting on

' the phone turned into a pricey activity. I

“I didn’t want to get rid of my cards
though because I kept thinking .I might run
into an emergency,” Keller said.

‘ Instead, he ﬁlled a beer mug with water,
dunked his cards —— all seven of them_—
and froze the glass.

“lfl need to use one, it will take a lot of

effort,” Williams said. A

This compulsive swiping stiﬂed recent

USF graduate Kathleen Piser’s ﬁnances,”

too. When her debt skyrocketed to $9,000 in
a matter of two years, she whipped out the
scissors. '

“I closed every account and chopped
upiiall my cards,” Piser said. “I was out of

A control and uneducated about credit. I

believe you can choose to use a credit card
as a service or a slave master.” V
Although Piser insists 18-year-olds
should take responsibility for overspending,
she realizes creditors prey on the ignorance
of young adults. V
“Creditors want us because they know
we’re.impulsive buyers who love the idea of
quick money,” Piser said. ‘
’ “Without education,_ giving credit to

I teens or young adults is like handing them a
key to ruin their future,” warned Joey ,
. ‘Henderson, director of education for ﬂte
Consumer Credit Counseling Service of

Florida Gulf Coast Inc.

According to Henderson, research con-
ducted by “Good Morning America” in
1999 revealed 40 percent of teens didn’t
know credit cards charge interest. In addi-
tion, 28’ percent had no clue the cards are a

‘ form of borrowing.

“With these numbers it is clear that we
are missing the boat in teaching young
adults money management,” Henderson
said. — *

He ‘ said a misunderstanding of how
interest works leads to the ﬁnancial damage.
He stresses that if a student with $1,000 of
credit debt only stuck to paying a minimum
monthly fee of $25 at 17 percent interest, the
student would take 12 years to slash the bal-
ance to zero. In the end, the student wo11ld

have shelled out $974 just for interest.

However, if the student sent the mini-
mum monthly payment plus $25, the bal-
ance would dwindle to zero in two years and
seven months, paying only $200 in interest.

“Some teens and young adults just do
not realize that if you stick to the 
you’ll only pay the interest each month,”
Henderson said.

Even employers now check credit
reports to test responsibility. 9

However, some students wonder why
creditors even give them the tool to create a
vulnerable future.

“When my parents were 26, they
couldn’t even get a gas card without my-
grandfather_ co-signing,” Keller said. “You
just couldn’t establish credit easily. Now,

you just sign on the dotted line.”

Now, credit card companies would
rather award credit to a mass amount of col-
lege students and make money on the late
fees, which now average $29 a pop.

“The fees are not out there in big let-
ters,” Hrabak said. ‘They are hidden.”

However, Henderson believes the new
strategy carries even more logic.

“If students can graduate high school,
they are seen as future customers,”
Henderson said.

Henderson wishes he could be at the
market where solicitors advertise, too.

“We’d like to set up a booth along side
the credit-card people and educate the stu-
dents. But how can we compete with a free
T—shirt?”

University of Maryland
puts students in hotels

ETAN HOROWITZ

The Diamondback

(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md.
— Resident life officials at the
University of Maryland report that
32 students are currently living‘ in
two local hotels because of a lack
of campus housing.

A freshman engineering major
describedthe hotel rooms as having,
“all the comforts of a hotel, but
none of the comforts of a dorm.”

’ Jan Davidson, associate director
of the resident life office, said that
for the last 10 to 15 years, the uni-
versity has been housing students in
the nearby University College Inn
and Conference Center Hotel until
dormitory housing for them can be
found.

Davidson reported that in the
past, students have always been
successfully moved into dorms
after their stay at the hotels.

The College Inn hotel rooms
house two students, with two beds, _
a bathroom, a television set-, a
phone, housekeeping services and a
data port for Internet access. The
hotel has two resident assistants to
help students with campus-related

-activities. V

’ vided with .vans and trucks to help

Cohen said he felt isolated in
the hotel for many reasons. Most
importantly, he can’t make phone
calls" because he doesn’t have a
credit card. He did say that he
enjoys the exercise he gets on his
long walks to class, though.

The Quality Inn Hotel nearby is
also serving as a home away from
home away from home for 126
other students. The university is
involved in a three-year lease, giv-
ing it ownership of one of the i
hotel’s wings, called Terrapin
Towers. This is the sixth consecu-
tive year the university has been
housing students in the Towers.
Towers residents choose to live
there, agreeing to pay their housing 
fees as usual.

At the Towers, rooms have cam- 2
pus phones, cable and Ethernet
jacks, beds and desks, in addition to I
normal university RAs.

It is often students who make
last-minute decisions not to attend
the University who create dorm
vacancies. When a vacancy in a
dorm becomes available, the uni-
versity fills it with studentsfrom
one of the two hotels.

Displaced students will be pro-

them to move into the dorms.

Start the football
season with spirit

After a long summer full of
anticipation and a challenging first
week of classes, the time has ﬁnally
come.

It’s a football weekend again.

As we all know, Saturday’s game
is going to be a bit different from past
football mania at Pitt. It will be the
Panthers’ first season game at Three
Rivers Stadium.— and whether the
game is a victory or not may have a
lot to do with the response and

_ turnout of the fans.

Tomorrow’s game will be a cli-

max of sorts following the struggle to

save Pitt Stadium and the gradual
acceptance of our fate to hike to the
North Side to watch football games.
It’s critical that we avoid making bad
excuses about the annoyance of trans-
portation, and instead hop on one of
the many convenient shuttles and

» support our team. As is evidenced by

past games against Penn State and

last year’s Notre Dame victory, Pitt

tends to do astoundingly better when
the fans are out in droves. _
Freshmen in particular should
take this opportunity to immerse
themselves in Panther spirit. Before
attending the game, they should be
sure to familiarize themselves with
the following critical ‘infomrationz
The words to the Pitt ﬁght ‘song are P-

E—N-N-S-T SUCKS! Don’t believe
the rumors that it’s' supposed to be V-
I-C-T—O—R—Y or anything generic like
that. This is one of our schoo1’s ﬁnest
traditions; it doesn’t matter who
We’re playing, our hate for Happy
Valley always comes out loud and
clear. 7

And learn thewords to the alma
mater, darn it. .

Season ticket holders can get a
head start on the pep by attending the
Countdown to Kickoff celebration,

’ Friday from 4-6:30‘p.m. on the Union

lawn. This little event allows one the
opportunity to maximize his or her
school spirit in the best way possible
—— by getting free Pitt stuff.

There’s a lot to celebrate this
weekend. We have three days off
from school; classes just started so
workloads shouldn’t be too severe
yet, at least in theory. And most
importantly, we have the chance to
start building a whole new slew of
football traditions on the North Shore.

Apathy is ofﬁcially a thing of the
past. It’s time to start this football sea-
son the right way — with genuine
enthusiasm, "a lot of yelling and
renewed vengeance for the Kent State
Golden" Flashes, the Nittany Lions
and any other foe who dares to stomp
on our new turf. ‘

ﬁcult without a degree. After one bad job I decid-

offers a goofy, colorful Pacino who sings
Sondheim (well, tries to,
anyway).

' Why is Pacino such a
motivator? 'I think it’s ' the
intensity. After all, the point
of watching .“Heat” isn’t to
see heavy—duty marital relationships
lunfold; it’s ‘to see Pacino push around
thugs in their own crib, or rip a television
out of the living room wall.

The same goes for “Any Given
Sunday.” Unlike any given sports movie,
it’s Pacino. who stands on the sidelines,
hollering at the top of his lungs. Put

Emilio Estevez in the same role and it’s .

just not the same.

But unlike other tough guys (such as
Clint Eastwood), Pacino plays savvy per-
sonalities; he dances through “Scent of a
Woman,” vision or no vision, and bar-
gains his way through a hopeless situa-
tion in “Dog Day Aftemoon.” His leads
are always dominating conversation, his
rants are always ﬂawless. No two-bit
antagonist has messed with a Pacino
character for decades, because he’s
always gutsy enough to pull through.

Timing is essential for the Pacino

. copycat. For example, it’s best to blow

up in the middle of asentence, and punch
the last word (e.g. “In my HOME!” or

“Now you’re gonna DIE, BIGTIME!”)

You’ll never see a Pacino wearing
jeans and a T-shirt. No matter who he’s
playing — cop, mobster, television pro-
ducer -—— he’s invariably sporting some
expensive three-piece suit. So if you
can’t muster the raw energy, you can at
least take fashion tips.

And remember, just like every social
situation, it’s all an act. Turn off the carn-
era and Pacino could be anybody. So
don’t feel bad if Pacino lessons don’t
work for you. There’s always Jack
Nicholson.

Recalling a wondrous Wednesday

Some days, the $14,000 or so that I
spend each year to rnatriculate here at the
University of Pittsburgh is deﬁnitely worth
it. These ‘are the days when the price of
admission on the roller coaster that is life’s
great journey almost seems too low, that
you, and not the ever—invisib1e “they,” are
making out on the deal. For me, Aug. 30
was one of those days.

I should have known that it would be a
special day. For starters, it was Wednesday,
Hump Day, the day when you know you
only have two more days until the week-
end, the day when simply ﬁnishing what
needs to be done feels like an accomplish-
ment. But this Wednesday was different

For one thing, all of the problems on

my algebra homework due at 8:00 a.m.
were correct. I couldn’t believe it: I actual-
ly did well on a math assignment! Oh,
happy day!’ I would have been absolutely

— thrilled if that was the only thing to go well

for the day, because math and I do not get
along very well. But for this assignment
(and hopefully for the rest of the semester),
we did.

Yet the day wasn’t through giving me
the VIP treatment. After my astronomy lec-
ture, I had to go to my recitation. Through
some mishap in the University’s communi-
cation process, I was assigned to the wrong
room. No big deal. I mean, I still showed
up at an astronomy class, just not the cor-
rect recitation. I11 fact, it wasn’t even a

recitation but a lecture on astrophysics.
Under normal circumstances, I would have

. immediately left and sought out the loca-

tion of my normal lecture. ‘

But instead, perhaps taken
by an adventurous spirit, I sat
down for what proved to be an
interesting hour."Ihe professor
(who happened to be British by
the way — crikey!) discussed
the Hubble Space Telescope and astronom-
ical units, and informed us that parsecs and
light years are actually measurements of
distance, not time.

And he managed to quickly review the

   
 

laws of physics. This would ordinarily put

A new era begins for Pitt’s foot-
ball team tomorrow, as the Panthers

host Kent State in the first game of.

the 2000 season. — _

The new era alluded to, albeit a
short one, will be the new but tempo-
rary home of the Panthers, Three
Rivers Stadium.

In 2001, Pitt will move into a
new stadium being constructed right
next to Three Rivers on the North
Side of the city. . M

' Both teams are coming off of los-
ing seasons in 1999;‘ Pitt was 5-6,
while Kent State finished 2-9.

The Golden Flashes are led by
senior quarterback Zach Williams.
Williams completed 17 of 26 pass
attempts last season as the backup to
Jose Davis, who graduated; Although
the new quarterback is unexperi-
enced, ‘Kent State head coach Dean
Pees believes that Williams has the
leadership potential that the Golden
Flashes need. -

bother them.

Well, maybe just a little.

“The weather wasn’t very good,
and neither was the footing. The weath-
er dictated our offense. We just weren’t
going to throw,” said Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried. “We thought we had a
size advantage on the
line, and with Craig,
we wanted to give
him the ball as much
as possible. He’s very
effective under condi-
tions like these.”

Heyward car-
ried 41 times and
scored three touch-
downs, also a career-
high. His running would be all the

did his freshmen year when he accu-

As far as Kent State’s defense
goes, the team improved its yardage
allowed per game by more than 85
yards last season.

DAVE MoANALL/ PHOTO EDIT

The Golden Flashes defense will
be led by senior tackle Richard
Bender and junior right end Mark
Strickland. Strickland has had a
strong off-season and was the team’s
outstanding defensive player in
spring practice.

One, of Kent’s strongest points is
the special teams, where punter Jared
Fritz played well as a freshman last
season. Kicker Dave Pavich is an
All-American candidate after leading
the team in scoring in 1999.

For the Panthers to break up
Kent’s defense, head coach Walt
Harris is relying on quarterbacks
John Turman and David Priestley to
lead the team.

The two spent last season sharing
the starting role. Although Priestley
initially started last season, it was
Turman who started seven of 11
games, completing 48 percent of his
passes. Harris has said that he will

Staff Writer

With an impressive combination
of size, strength, and speed, it’s fair-
ly easy to mistake Kevan Barlow as

a stereotypical jock..At 6—foot—l and -

235 pounds, the senior running back
boasts a display of aggression and
power on the field.

Off the field, though, it is easyto
see that Barlow is much more than
just another football player, more
than a compilation" of stats. He is
easygoing and charismatic with a
great sense of humor, and in general,
one of the more approachable guys
on the team.

Affectionately known to others
as KB, B-low, or simply B, Barlow
has been a force on this Panthers
team throughout his career. As a
freshman during the 1997 season,
Barlow saw action in seven games,
rushing for 108 yards while averag-
ing 23.3 yards per reception. Barlow
was instrumental in Pitt’s upset of
nationally ranked Virginia Tech by
scoring the deciding touchdown with
5:15 left in the game. He also turned
in an impressive performance in the

Liberty Bowl, rushing for a season— '

and team—high 68 yards on nine car-
ries.

Barlow then saw increased play-
ing time during his sophomore cam-
paign and utilized the opportunity to
establish himself as a key player in
the Pitt lineup. He finished the sea-
son first on the team in rushing yards
(533) and attempts (121). He record-

Barlow also had a 61-
yard touchdown run in
that game, and it was
given the honor_ of
“Best Run” by Compaq
— College Football Plays
of the Week. His stel-
lar performance
against Kent resulted
in Barlow being named
the Big East and East
Coast Athletic

was once again the-

   

Player of the Week. _

But Barlow’s success during the
1999 season was not limited to just
one "game. In what he considers to be
his greatest personal football
achievement, Barlow threw a 13-
yard-touchdown pass to Latef Grim
in _the Panthers’ close loss to
Syracuse. Barlow also has the dis-

tinction of scoring the last touch—'

down ever at Pitt Stadium. The 2-
yard run with 1:41 left in the game
sealed the upset victory over Notre

Dame and provided the proper close

to the Pitt Stadium era. -

“The Notre Dame ‘game and
scoring the last touchdown and the
fans running down on the field is my
greatest memory ever,” Barlow said.

Barlow has certainly been
involved with football long enough
to have an extensive collection of
memories. Born and raised‘ around
the game, he had eight uncles who
always made him catch a pass or go
outside and start up a game.

In his last three years, he
amassed 1,531 yards rushing with 16
touchdowns and 433 receiving yards
with» 10 - touchdown receptions.
Barlow was the recipient of numer-

ous honors, including being named
secondteam All-State and being a
two time All—City selection. In addi-.
tion, both the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review selected Barlow as the City
League Player of the Year in 1996
for. his work ‘at Peabody High
School. 1

Following four outstanding
years of high school ball, Barlow
was faced withthe decision of where
to play during his collegiate career.
But in his mind, there really was,no
choice to be made. '

“I decided to play at Pitt because
of the best coach in the country, Walt
Harris. He’s an excellent coach,”
Barlow said. “He’s a player’s coach‘
and he’s a good ' guy, and I was
impressed by him.”

But while Barlow is an extreme-
ly dedicated member of the Panther '
football team, he is certainly not “all
work and no play.” When he is not at

' the library reading, he can usually be V
_found at home, -often relaxing and '

watching the television.

commentator.  ’ . ‘ I

As the September sun beats down . _
once again on the shiny, blue, -gold, ‘

black and silver helmets, it is a

reminder of how special the National ~
/‘ Football League really is.
Twenty—two bodies on a long, rec- _ "

tangular field: smashing‘ and-"crunching
each other with one goal:‘ withstanding

enough punishment to make it to the,

Super _ Bowl. (Cue amazingly catchy
NFL Films music.) "

Until then, the players will have to
endure the hot Septembers, the bruising
Octobers, the cold
Novembers and the
bitter Decembers, not _
only of this season, but
of seasons past.

Memories filter into

game of football takes over
all five senses.

Running backs must
“mend the buck of a billy goat,” ‘ _
“withstand the wail of the ban— ,
shee” and think “demolition derby,
not Grand Prix.” \

All right, that’s just too much
imagery for my brain. Facenda was a
great man and I miss his voice.

The NFL.opens on Sunday and the
season would be nothing without my
own senseless predictions.

With the ghost of Facenda by my
side, I smell perfection, or is that “the

smell of dry hands, bruised and bat— ’

tered, the skin cracked open, showing

a the scars of a war called football?”

American Football Conference

« It’s a safe bet to go with the big

Franklin ‘D. Roosevelt, Winston
Churchill and Joseph Stalin, or Johnny

- Unitas, Eric Dickerson and Matt

Bouza.

No, I’m talking- about Peyton
Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin
Harrison of the Indianapolis Colts. That
will be too much for any defense in the

' league, let alone the division;

There is’ no Dan Marino‘ in Miami,
which means some guy named Jay

' Fiedler will start for the Dolphins.

What’s that, Mr. Facenda, you have
something to say?
“Hopes that were high in the thrill

On Pitt’s first possession, it needed
only three plays because Heyward car-
ried three times for runs of 11, 2 and 58
yards, the latter for a Panther touch-
down.

“He’s the best back in America. l’ve
said it all along. He broke that first run,
and that just set the tone for the day,”
Gottfried said.

On the Panthers next possession,
Heyward rushed 10 straights times,
which allowed him to tie an NCAA
record for rushing 13 consecutive times.
All of Heyward’s carries accounted for
the offense on this drive as well.

The Panthers then drove down to
the Kent State 23, but Heyward fum-
bled. Kent State couldn’t move it, so the
Panthers got it back, but freshman quar-

terback Darnell Dickerson fumbled the

snap, which was recovered by the

._Flashes’ L.D. Hartman at the Pitt 45.
But three plays later, junior Troy

Washington intercepted a Tim Phillips
pass and returned it 48 yards to the Kent

‘State 22.

“The quarterback was looking at

V [the receiver] all the way. As soon as he
_threw it, I knew I’d be there. I should
j have been gone, but I dressed for

gave the Panthers the ball on the Kent
State 36, Pitt drove the ball down to the
1 but was stopped on fourth down.
After Kent State’s first seven pos-
sessions were all for three plays apiece,
they put together a 13-play drive, high-
lighted by a 17- and l0-yard runs "by
Phillips , and an - ll-yard" run ' by
Wilkerson, who came into the game as
the nation’s all—purpose yardage leader,
but rushed for 33 yards on 20 carries.
The Golden Flashes had to settle for a
34-yard ﬁeld goal by Larry Steinberg.

The ﬁeld goal stopped Pitt’s streak of 11
quarters without allowing a point.

On the ensuing kickoff, Panther
return man Michael Hadley was tackled
in the endzone, closing out the first half
scoring at 21-5.

On the Panthers second possession
of the second half, Walker scored on the

, fourth play of the drive, a 34-yard run,"

but it. was called -back on a holding

penalty. ,
“I thought he was going to score a

- touchdown every time he touched the

ball,” said Gottfried. . A
The next time the Panthers touched

the ball, they started on the Kent State A

31 and made their way down to the 17,
but kicker Jeff VanHome missed a 34-
yard ﬁeld goal. ’

“There was a miscommunication
between me and Billy Osborn, just a
bad connection,” said VanHome.

The last scoring of the day occurred .

midway through the fourth quarter,
when Heyward rambled 42 yards for the
touchdown. The extra point was con-
verted by senior Mark Brasco, who lost
his kicking job last season against North
Carolina State to Jeff VanHome.

VanHome was pleased‘ for Brasco
getting one last chance.

“I’m happy for him. He deserves it,
[for] the way he stuck it out. He’s been
through a lot of things some others
haven’t,"’ said VanHome. ‘

Even though the Golden Flashes
had their problems, Gottfried was
impressed with Kent State. ‘

“You have to give them credit. They
did a nice job and played hard. They
hung tough and stopped us on the goal
line that one time. They’re* well-
coached,” Gottfried said.

Kent State head coach Glen Mason,
whose name is being mentioned for the
vacant Ohio State head coaching job,
was impressed with the lfanther
defense. . ’ 3

‘‘They’re real good. You don’t go
the whole season ranked in numerous
categories if you’re not good,” Mason
said. ' -

I v Grim, who set Pitt records with

1,106 receiving yards, 100.6 yards
per game, 6.8 catches per game and
75 receptions in a single season. The

. latter two achievements also earned

him Big East Conference records.

Grim hurt his ankle in the first
fall scrimmage at Three Rivers
Stadium but has returned to practice
and_ says that he is “95 percent and
will play.”

Bryant, who was namedto The
Sporting News and Football News’
All—Freshman teams in 1999, pulled
in 51 receptions ‘for 844 yards and

. six touchdowns a year ago.

On the ground, Pitt looks to

J Kevan Barlow, who led the team in_
rushing last year and has had a very ‘

good off-season. Also helping out
the running game will be sophomore
Torrie Cox and senior Nick Goings._

Defensive coordinator Paul
Rhoads will try and put back togeth-

er a team that was plagued by’

injuries last season.

The front line of the Pitt defense
has Ryan Smith, Dan LaCarte, Penny
Semaia and Bryan Knight.

Ryan Gonsales is back in the
lineup after coming off a knee injury
his sophomore year, and he has the
potential to be one of the Big East’s
best as a middle linebacker. He,
along with junior Amir Purifoy, will
anchor the Pitt defense in the mid-
dle.

The other linebackers slated to
start are Gerald -Hayes and Brandon
Williams. Hayes is a sophomore who
had a solid freshman season last
year, while Williams is a Converted
running back who only began prac-
ticing at linebacker at the beginning
of training camp. ‘

Also leading the defensive team
is hard-hitting free safety Ramon
Walker. It is unknown whether
Walker will play tomorrow, howev-

er, as he has missed a number prac- ~

tices with some deep bruises.

Last season, Walker had 131
tackles, the most by a Panther
defender in 12 years.

. Pitt will start freshman William
“Tutu” Ferguson and redshirt sopho-
more Shawn Robinson on the cor-

‘ ners, with Walker, if available, and

junior Mark Ponko playing safety.
Jay Junko will have the punting
duties for Pitt, with Nick Lotz

"returning as the placekicker. Senior
Tim Stein will return punts along A

with Bryant, while Ferguson and
freshman Shawntae Spencer will run
kicks back. .

Pitt has won all five of its meet-

ings with Kent State, including a 30- -

23 victory last season. The ‘Panthers
have also never lost a game to an
opponent from the Mid-American
Conference, going 14-O all-time.

on ESPN’s SportsCenter is, he
answered emphatically with a laugh,
“Without a doubt, Stuart Scott. No
doubt, that’s easy.” _

Barlow will graduate in April
with a degree in administration of
justice, when he planson going into

E the work force but‘ keeping enough

time aside to help out in the commu-
nity. But thoughts of life after Pitt
are tucked away for now, as the
entire 2000 football season is yet to
unfold. Early on, head coach Walt
Harris has been impressed with what
he has seen from Barlow.

“Kevan has probably without a
doubt put more into this season than
any that he’s had, and I learned a

long time ago that the more you put
into it, the more you take out of it,”
Harris said. “Ithink Kevan’s going
to have a real good year for us.”

Among his goals for this year,
Barlow lists having a winning sea-
son,- going to a bowl game, and get-
ting 1,000 yards. He attributeshis
success and improvement so far this
season to running back coach Kenny
Carter, who Harris brought to Pitt
during the off-season. . ,_

“I call him a blessing in dis-
guise,” Barlow said. “I just want to
get 1,000 yards andthen dedicate it
to him because he’s a great coach.” ‘

Barlow looks forward to playing
this season’s home games at Three
Rivers Stadium,noting that it is full
of history and memories. As a senior
and an experienced starter, Barlow

l3

will be called upon this season to be
a team leader, at position he
acknowledges and willingly accepts.

“I was around some great leaders
—— Pete Gonzalez, Tony Orlandini,
Julian Graham, Hank Poteat —— so
now it’s my turn to step up and take
that role,” Barlow said’.

Barlow will have his first oppor-
tunity to assume such a role in this
weekend’s matchup against Kent
State. But considering his outstand-
ing performance against the Golden
Flashes last season, a game he dedi-
cated to his then recently-departed
grandmother, this year’s
opener carries added significance.

“I’m going to try and go out
there and play to the best of _my abil-
ity to try to help this team win,” he
said.
