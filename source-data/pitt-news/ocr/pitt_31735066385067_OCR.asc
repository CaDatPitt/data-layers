Dukakis :
rallies

' Western

PA vo te rs

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Democratic Presidential Candi-
date Michael Dukakis stressed
the importance of national health
care and the economic rebirth of
Western Pennsylvania while con-
tinuing his attacks on vice presi-
dent Bush at a rally in
Greensburg yesterday afternoon.

”The single most important is-
sue we face here and across the
country is the creation of good
jobs,” Dukakis said.

When Dukakis asked the
crowd if he won the debate with
the vice president, the crowd
cheered loudly. Dukakis then
said the debate was ”long over-
due. The American people final-

ly got a chance to get down to the
real issues.”

Dukakis said that he feared that
Bush would support further cuts
in Social Security. He said, ”So-
cial Security is not a welfare pro-
gram. lt’s a contract between
generations, and Lloyd Bentsen
and I will never break that
contract.”

Dukakis also criticized Bush for
providing extensive tax breaks for
the wealthy. He said that the

average teacher in America
doesn't earn the amount of
money that the wealthy will get
in tax returns.

Dukakis attacked the Republi-
cans for opposing a bill that re-
quired factory owners to inform
workers of plant closings in
advance.

He noted that Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan
Quayle led the fight against the
bill in the Senate. He also said

Students respond to 5GB talk show

By Stephanie Myers
For The Pitt News

Racial relations were the topic
of last Wednesday's SGB talk
show on WPTS—FM. SGB Presi-
dent Craig Jackson commented
on the importance of this talk
show during yesterday's SGB
meeting, saying that they didn't
have to take any music breaks
and were even forced to turn
away phone calls.

Jackson was encouraged by
people's responses. He ex-
plained, ”! now realize that the
problem was more serious than
I thought. First, because people
do have racist tendencies, but
more importantly that they feel
nothing can be done.”

Jackson was very surprised
with the show’s outcome. He
pointed out that there had never
before been that many phone
calls.

”This was the most well-
received show we've ever
had,"said Jackson.

Jackson said that students

would call and comment that air-
ing such a show wouldn’t change
people's opinions on racism.

Jackson said the calls ranged.

from people sympathizing and
encouraging with the ad hoc ra-
cial relations committee to an
unidentified person's claiming
that the Chinese Communist
Party had sent 600 students to Pitt
to steal all of America's technol-
ogy and take it back to China.

In other business, the board an-
nounced that it will be contribut-
ing funds to any organization
wishing to build a homecoming
float. AT&T will also donate
money.

”Any student organization
wishing to build a float for the
homecoming parade will not
only be funded, by the Student
Government Board, but also,
AT&T will be supplying funds to
help organizations to produce
real floats, and not what we've
had in recent years,” Jackson
said.

On Sept. 27, board member
Pamela Rich talked to Marlin

Pease, associate director of Stu-
dent Telecommunications Serv-
ice. He stated that a new phone
service was installed to control
the funds of STS as well as the
funds of students using the
service.

A continuing problem for STS
is students who steal another stu-
dent's access code and run up the
phone bill. To prevent this from
happening, STS established a
credit limit for each student.

’’If a student gets a hold of
another student's access code, it
will be shut off when the limit is
exceeded,” explained Rich.

One disadvantage that Rich list-
ed is that students cannot be noti-
fied in advance that their phone
service is about to be terminated.

Rich proposed a suggestion to
Pease that STS should set up a
sort of answering service that
could be reached night and day
where students could call and
find out exactly how much their
phone bills were. This would al-

that the Republicans want to keep
”minimum wage a poverty
wage."

Dukakis supporters waved
Dukakis—Bentsen posters and
cheered throughout the rally.

Edward Grudevich of Canons-
burg attended the rally, and he
said he liked Dukakis because he
was ”not a politician, just an or-
dinary guy who is interested.”

Another supporter present at
the rally was Abbe Edison, a psy-

chology teacher at Westmoreland
County Community College. She
said, ”He [Dukakis] is supporting
a lot of the values for individual
freedom.” ‘
Edison said that she andlher
students had been hurt by cuts in
education by the Reagan ad-
ministration, and she believed
Dukakis would help fight the
high costs of college.

Suspect arrested for murder that caused rampage

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —— Police
Wednesday morning charged a
man with murdering an up-and-
coming drug lord whose death
touched off a night of mayhem in
a poverty-stricken area of north
Philadelphia, authorities said.

A crowd of 50 to 200 youths
roamed the streets of the Hunting
Park neighborhood Tuesday
night, flipping and burning two
cars and firing shots in the air_.—

More than 60 people have
been killed in drug-related vio-
lence this summer, including
5-year-old Marcus Yates, whose
death triggered a wave of anti-
drug protests and marches across
the city this summer.

nated by radioactive fallout from
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear ac-

Health Secretary Alfredo Beng-
zon, who led the raiders to a
warehouse in the Manila suburb
of Paranaque, said the imported
milk was part of a shipment of
dairy products returned to
Western Europe in 1986 after the
accident.

Last month, health officials also
recovered more than 700 cans of
the contaminated milk that were
distributed to several provinces
outside Manila.

The local distributors of the
milk product denied knowledge
of the shipment.

Sen. Edward Helfrick, R-
Northumberland, said he and
other opponents of the agency-
shop law would ”work as hard to
draw support for the repeal of
agency shop as the union leaders
did to get the votes to pass this
obnoxious law.”

Under agency—shop provisions,
unions are allowed to charge
non-members covered by the
contract a fee to cover the costs
of collective bargaining.

The agency—shop bill was
signed into law earlier this year
by Gov. Robert P. Casey.

Discovery ready for
lift off on schedule

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)

— NASA cleared Discovery for
flight today and gave the go-
ahead to fuel the vehicle for a lift
off at 9:59 a.m. EDT Thursday on
the first U.S. manned flight since
the Challenger tragedy.

Anticipation and tension rose
across the NASA system as final
preparations accelerated. ”Even
the weather is looking good,”
Truly said.

An equipment flaw that threa-
tened to delay the launch was
resolved by engineers who
worked through the night. Indus-
try contractors reported to Crip-
pen today that the problem,
involving a damaged O—ring on a
rocket being prepared for a future
shuttle flight, should have no im-
pact on the Discovery mission.

BAS membership drive
sparks student interest

By Jessica Coville
Staff Writer

On Thursday, Jan. 16, 1969, a
group of concerned black stu-
dents presented a number of re-
quests to the administration of the
University of Pittsburgh. They be-
lieved that their requests
represented the larger aims of
black people throughout the
black community of Pittsburgh.

The group named themselves
the Black Action Society and they
considered themselves the ”voice
of the black community” in
Pittsburgh.

Their requests focused on three
basic concerns: one, more black
students, faculty and staff mem-
bers at the university; two, more
black programs designed to facili-
tate the existence of black people
on this campus; three, more black
educational courses and

These requests went into effect

in 1969 and today, almost 20
years later, the BAS is still one of
the largest student organizations
at Pitt.

During the fall term of 1987,
there were over 1,800 black stu-
dents enrolled at Pitt. More than
800 of these students are mem-
bers of the BAS.

Dawn Hill, chairperson of
membership of the BAS, has been
managing an intensive member-
shipgdrive for the organization.

Hill said, ’’I can't stress enough
how important it is for everybody
to come and fill out a member-
ship card.”

Rehearing sought in
state elections case

By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ An
attorney for a candidate in the
nullified elections for state
Supreme and Superior courts
filed a petition Wednesday
seeking a rehearing of the de-
cision that canceled the races.

Neil O'Donnell, who
represents Democratic Superi-
or Court nominee Kate Ford
Elliott, was joined by the
Democratic State Committee

in asking the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court to allow addi-
tional arguments in the case.
In a five-sentence order
Tuesday, the court terminated
the two races, saying the state
constitution dictates holding
judicial elections in odd-
numbered years and apart
from other political races.
O’Donnell’s petition for
reargument states the court

They're safe. extremely effective.

‘ and as simple to take as a daily
vitamin. Here are some questions
you should ask yourself about any
birth control method. and some
answers about “the pill."

D How SAFE is IT? For women
under 30. the pill isjust as safe

as any other birth control method.
its also safer than pregnancy and
childbirth. A health professional can
tell you if there's a good reason to use
another method instead.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Taken as directed. birth
control pills either keep

your ovaries from releasing
eggs—no eggs. no conception-
or change your cervix or
uterus. making if harder for
eggs and.spenn to
get together.

HOW WILL I FEEL?
'lbday's finely calculated
dosages have reduced the

minor side effects you may have
heard about. like morning nausea.
tender breasts. and spotting between
periods. If side effects do occur. they
usually disappear as your body adjusts
to the pill. Weight gain? Some women
gain. some lose. You can usually solve
either problem by adjusting your diet.

process used in scheduling the
election.

Cohen, speaking with
reporters outside his home in
Harrisburg, described the at-
torney who filed the case,
Richard Sprague of Philadel-

phia, as ”a hired gun” who
”hits the target.”

Noting that the suit was filed
months into the election
process’, Cohen said: ’’If the
case were raised in January 
then I would say there is a
concern about the issue. But I
think it was raised in August
because there was some in-
creasing interest somewhere
about the candidates, not
about the process.”

Ertel told reporters in Wil-
liamsport, ”Some on the
Supreme Court don't want me
because I have a reputation for
a straight interpretation of the

law.”

But Sprague, reached at his
law office, said he filed the suit
because the election
represented a violation of the
constitution.

”|t’s a shame and it does a
disservice to both Cohen and
Ertel that they don't talk about
the constitution  but talk
about people's motives,”
Sprague said.

”The constitution requires
that judges be elected in odd-
numbered years. The purpose
of my suit was to show the
constitution . . applies to
everybody,” he added.

”Nobody hired me. Nobody
asked me to do it. I did it be-
cause I am a lawyer who hap-
pens to believe the law should
be applied to everybody,” he
said.

Among the candidates, ap-
parently only Elliott was hold-
ing much hope that the
election might be reinstated.
Cohen said he considered the
race over, and Ertel said the
chances of taking any success-
ful legal action before the
Nov. 8 election were ”in-
finitesimally small.”

’’I don't see any recourse,”
Cohen said, also doubting that

the petition would be success-
ful. ”The matter is con-
cluded.” .

The fourth candidate,
Republican Supreme Court
nominee Anita B. Brody, said
her attorneys were reviewing
the decision, and she did not
know what action she might
take. '

Brody declined to discuss
the allegations made by Co-
hen and Ertel.

Cohen noted that a previous
decision cleared the way for a
Supreme Court election in an
even-numbered year in 1982.

Changes in doctors’ fees debated

. By Daniel Q. Haney

AP Science Writer

BOSTON (AP) — A top—to—
bottom reorganization of physi-
cian fees, requested by Congress,
could raise the pay of general
practitioners by 70 percent while
cutting some surgeons’ incomes
in half, its author said.

If adopted by private and
governmental insurance pro-
grams, the long—awaited plan
would sharply increase the pay
for office visits while reducing
fees for surgery and other proce-
dures, such as installing
pacemakers.

The p|an’s architect, economist

William C. Hsiao of the Harvard
School of Public Health, con-
tends the current system is ”un-
workable and unfair,”
short-changing doctors for day—to—
day management of their patients
while paying them far too much
for exotic tests and other highly
technical work.

He said his proposed fee struc-
ture will change doctors’ finan-
cial incentives, and this will alter
the way they practice medicine
and ultimately improve patient
care.

”You can predict that under the
new system, doctors will be will-

ing to spend a lot more time with
patients to examine and counsel
them,” Hsiao said. ”Right now,
physicians are being penalized
financially for spending time with
patients.”

In addition, he says the
changes could encourage more
young doctors to go into primary
patient care and lower the over-
all cost of medical treatment.

If Hsiao’s plan is universally
3d0Pf€d, the biggest losers would
be heart, chest and eye surgeons,
whose income would fall 40 per-
cent to 50 percent.

Increased drug gang
violence disturbing

The latest incident of drug-related gang violence occurred Mon-
day in north Philadelphia when 50 to 200 youths roamed the streets,
destroying property and firing shots into the air to avenge the death
of an emerging drug-gang leader.

V This type of violence is not new to those of us who watch continu-
ous television reports of gang activities on the streets of Los Angeles.
It appears that the problem is spreading across the country.

Police are faced with a difficult dilemma. How do you combat or-
ganizations which offer a quick, guaranteed, high income and require
little effort for a big return? Maybe someone should ask Elliot Ness.

Drug gangs have become the reincarnation of the 19305’ organized
crime mobs. Back in those prohibition days, crime ”bosses” fed upon
the demand for alcohol. Today, the drugs are different, but the prin-
ciple remains the same. ' A

Police and Congress have been rel-atively ineffective in breaking
the cycle of drug gangs. An arrest of one drug gang leader simply
creates an opening for another.

America's drug problem has switched to a new deviation. The form-
er threat of drugs stemmed from the potential users and their lack
of attention and education. In the wake of a national ”Just say no”
campaign, many of us are more aware of the dangers of drugs. Now,
however, the increasing problem is the violence between suppliers
for control of the drug market. For these ”business people,” drugs
are still as much a product as toothpaste, and more profitable.

If we are going to stop the success of drug gangs, we must start
taking them seriously. Perhaps in addition to arresting drug dealers
and establishing harsher penalties, authorities should start thinking
of the drug problem as a business problem as well. Gangs are no
longer a group of delinquents; they've discovered the power of ”big”

business. Only now, when a salesman is fired, it is permanent.

What it's

”And this is Pumpkin, and this s

is Tuffy. They need extra special
care.” I was standing in a stark
room, lit by florescent lights,
lined with banks of cages con-

. taining cats.

Research cats. Bred and raised
for the ultimate goal of giving
their lives for medicine. The per-
son teaching me my new duties
pulled Pumpkin, a lively orange
cat, out of her cage, and put her
on the floor. With her hind legs
tucked up in the air, Pumpkin
pulled herself across the floor by
means of her front paws.

Pumpkin was paralyzed from
the waist down. Surgically.

The initial nausea left me as the
little cat crawled up beside me
and cried with a voice that sound-
ed like a joy buzzer sound effect.
The cat needed affection, like any
household pet. Pumpkin turned
out to be sociable and totally ad-
justed to what had happened to
her. Tuffy turned out to be a
tough character, hence her name.
Tuffy could pull herself up into a
second-tier cage by means of her
front paws. On the floor, they
could pick up considerable
speed. g _ _ ‘ V _ _ H

I took the position with a
department in Pitt's School of
Medicine because I needed the
money and I cared for animals.
During a period of almost two
years, I did my best to provide
conscientious care to those cats,
who had never seen daylight or
smelled fresh air.

The paralyzed cats had abso-
lutely no feeling from the waist
down and apparently suffered
few ill effects from the operation
which had been performed on
them. It was explained to me that
the results of experiments per-
formed on them could benefit hu-
mans who were paralyzed from
automobile accidents.

I got attached to the furry little
critters, paying attention to their
health problems. Sometimes they
needed injections of antibiotics
or special medicine. If they didn't
have plastic bubble paper or
foam rubber mats under the
newspaper (the University Times,
without fail) lining their cages,
they might develop bed sores
which could get infected in a
nasty way.

It wasn't such a bad job. The
duties were simple, and never

The life of a non-beer drinker

I don't like beer.

I don't like squash either, but
that doesn't cause me nearly as
much grief as not liking beer
does.

As most of you know, beer is
the main liquid refreshment for
the majority of college students,
especially late at night, or before
football games. We impress each
other by quaffing large amounts
of brew, getting drunk, throwing
up and passing out.

I am not implying that doing so
is a bad thing (except passing out
and throwing up have not been
a pleasant experience in the past,
personally). I have enjoyeddoing
so in the past. But not with beer.

This dislike of beer has gotten
people to jump to the conclusion
that I am a naive, uptight kind of
guy who doesn't drink because
either his mom told him not to or
because he thinks alcohol is the
beverage of the Devil.

Neither is true, I assure you.
But it has gotten to the point
where I will carry one beer
around with me at parties so as
to not have a friend come up to
me and say, ”Come on, loosen

having more than two dozen cats
at any time meant that they could
receive the best care possible.

It helped to refer to the cats by
their serial number and not by
name, in that an animal worker
doesn't get quite so attached to
them. Calling a cat C-165 instead
of Tiny seemed a bit impersonal,
but since most of the cats had
nice personalities, except for two
named Twin, it made sense not
to get too close to them, since
their lives were so short.

So, for approximately two

up, have a beer.” Arrghh!!!!

Beerbeerbeerbeerbeerbeer...
I'm surrounded by beer. What
does the average student drink,
500 gallons a semester? Why is
beer so important?

An easily answered question:
one, beer is something everyone
at a party has in common; two,
it leads to all sorts of drinking
games which quicken the arrival
of the ”buzz"; three, it helps peo-
ple loosen up; and lastly, because.
it is tons cheaper than the next
available alcoholic beverage and

laboratory animals  

like normal cats, get into fights;
and not suprisingly, two litters of
tiger-striped kittens were born —
one on Christmas day.

I got a bit disillusioned when a
Taiwanese urologist insisted on
butchering a couple of my Christ-
mas kittens. I felt that he was
replicating someone else’s results
to justify some research grants
(grants make the School of Medi-
cine happen, believe me).

It was so sad that perfectly
good animals never had a chance
at a normal life. At the time of this
writing, there's a beautiful but
slightly neurotic cat named Cur-
ly who has been living in a cage
which measures about four
square feet. Though she has all
the food and water she could ask
for, her tail had been surgically
altered to look like a corkscrew.
I was told that it was done just to
prove that it could be done. She
has been in that cage for four
years.

Certain similarities between
cats’ spinal columns and a hu-
man's could be inferred, but the
justification of selective butcher-
ing of animals seems suspicious
when the bottom line is pulling

is available in large quantities. '

Notice its great taste is not on
the list.

The majority of people that I've
talked to don't like beer, to my
amazement. But because of rea-
sons one and (especially) three,
they ”acquire” a taste for it. I've
tried, I've tried, but to no avail.

Actually, I ha_ve another reason
for not liking beer besides its
taste: its carbonation. (I don't
drink carbonated beverages, like
Coke and Pepsi, and boy, that is
as much of a pain as not drink-
ing beer). Embarrassingly, beer
gives me a bad case of the burps.

Anyone who would say to just
not drink beer has probably never
wandered through a party where
every single other person has a
beer in his or her hand. People
give you weird looks, and I al-
ready have enough problems

money into the School of Medi-
cine. Or doctors’ bank accounts.

My last duties working with
animals were with beagles who

had undergone transplant sur- '

gery. I like dogs as much as cats,
and it was heartbreaking for me
to try and get this dog who was
rejecting its transplanted liver to
accept some food.

I tried everything, mixing baby
food with hamburger, rubbing it
onto the dog's gums. I was in
tears while hugging the dog, who
was nothing but skin and bones,
talking to it in an encouraging
voice. It would not eat. It had
given up its will to live. I couldn't
bring myself to have it killed by
lethal injection. It was the last day
that I worked there. I just couldn't

beagles.

If animal research provides life-
saving techniques or findings, it
almost seems justifiable. But per-
forming cosmetic research or
scamming for federal grants
seems criminal.

Brady amendment shot dead

As soon as word got around
that the Brady Amendment on
gun control had been defeated,
everyone at the Wounded Knee
Bar and Grill began to celebrate.
The drinks flowed, and customers
took turns shooting out the
stained—glass windows.

"Congratulations," I told Cra-
zy Jesse, a Saturday night special
gun-lover. ''If the, Brady Amend-
ment had passed, a person would
have had to know how to give
Americans instant gratification.”

”We couldn't have done it

without Congress,” Crazy Jesse

admitted modestly.
"How did you get Congress to
goalong?" ’ V
"We paid them,” he replied.
l”We have this fund that we
spread ‘around when it looks as
if someone is going to try and
make you wait a week for a gun.
Congress is pretty hungry for
money during an election year.”
"How wonderful to know that
Congress voted with its heart.”
"You can't have good govern-
ment unless you give them some
money. Of course, we didn't buy
everyone. There were a few
members who voted against the
amendment because of their con-
victions."
"’How did you deal with those

A people?”

"We gave them money, too."
"I'm pleased that the gun lob-
by doesn't discriminate. I guess
the police chiefs who wanted the

Article on

Speaking for the majority of
ZBT, lfeel that an unfair and in-
accurate editorial column was
printed in The Pitt News on Mon-
day [Sept. 26]. Not only was the
article inaccurate, but there were
blatant blanketed statements
made about the Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity and pledges, not to
mention the whole Greek system,
that were not true.

Using such names and infer- _

ences as "belligerent ignora-
mous" and "drunken, fighting,
poor souls” shows just how un-
professional the writer is. And us-
ing such tactics as this just to get
his own aggressions out is taste-
less. These judgements are not

\ only ridiculous and uncalled for,

but made by such a "belligerent

I ignoramous" himself that even

he didn't realize that he wasn't
sitting in the ZBT section.

This gdoltish individual over-
looked the minute fact that he
was sitting in a section that fe-
males (not ZBT) were saving.
Opting for the obviously instigat-
ing choice of sitting in seats that
were being saved shows the
shallow-minded provocation of
this person, whose unmistakable
goal was to stir up trouble for jui-
cy reading. What he failed to gain
from his c|osed—mindedness was
that the definitely sober girls sav-
ing the seats asked the goader to
leave nicely. When they met a
less than nice attitude in return
from him, one of the girls’
boyfriends noticed and ap-
proached the insolent offender to
defend his girlfriend's honor.
They were nowhere near the ZBT
section.

The Greek system is composed
of reasonable, understanding in-
dividuals who would talk to

happy that you managed to
defeat it."

"The police don't know any-
thing about firearms. All they are
trying to do is prevent themselves
from being killed. If they had
their way, no one could buy a
handgun in America.”

”The fools,'' I spat out. "Hand—

guns are the very things that are
keeping us from becoming
savages.”

"The Brady Amendment is-
finished," Crazy Jesse said. "And
if you don't drink to that, I will
put a hole through you.”

"Aw, come on, Jesse, you're
only kidding.” ’

, "Try me." I‘

"|s it true, Jesse, that you were
recently discharged from the fun-
ny farm?"

”Something like that. That's
why I prayed so hard they would
defeat this amendment. The bill
was aimed at people like myself
who couldn't afford to wait seven
days to get a pistol.” ’

"If the Brady Amendment had
passed, it would have been very

. unfair. After all, you're just as en-

titled to be part of the American
dream as anyone else,” I told
him.

''I'm glad you said that. If you
hadn't, I might have blown your

someone about this concern. But

just like any other normal person, .

if provoked by a "belligerent ig-
noramous" who doesn't try to
talk to them about this problem
but confronts them with an atti-
tude, they have a right to get up-
set. If that writer can't understand
that any person gets defensive
when confronted in a belligerent
manner, not just him, then he is
walking around without his glass-
es on, since the Greeks are just
like every other normal individu-
al. The only division between the
Greeks and the non-Greek
populace is in the writer's eyes.

We, the Greeks, help promote
spirit, provide leadership, and
help keep the social life of the
university strong, among other
things. .

The purpose for this rebuttal is
not to embarrass the writer, as he
obviously but unsuccessfully
tried to do to our fraternity and
the entire Greek system, but
merely to inform the readers of
this paper that these personal at-

‘ tacks on ZBT and the Greeks are

not only uncalled for but untrue.
John [Enright’s] whole column
was plainly the only way he
knew to blow off steam, since he
obviously doesn't know how to
approach someone about a
problem he has. The "crux of this
matter” is really that people, like
John, form an opinion of the
Greeks because of a reaction they
get when they express their
views. What they don't realize is
that maybe it's the way that they
express them — like John's
column.

"Don't worry, Crazy Jesse. As
long as the gun lobby has the
clout, I'm on your side. After all,

"the Brady Amendment could

only have slowed down the kill-
ing, not eliminated it. I'll take an
Uzi submachine gun over a‘bad
firearms law any day."

Jesse took another , shot of
booze. "They will never take my
gun away,” he vowed.

"How are you going to stop
them?"

"I'm a lifetime member of the
gun lobby. We're a major force
for moderation in this country."

"I believe you, Jesse,” I said.
"The only reason I can sleep at
night is because I know that you
keep a revolver under your
pillow.”

"But I am law—abiding."

”You certainly are. You may be
a little shaky in the church stee-
ple, but when it comes to per-
suading Congress to vote the right
way, you're a tiger."

LETTERS

In regard to Mr. Enright’s
[column] printed Monday, I have
a few things to say. -

First of all, I do not feel th
Greeks portray a derogatory im-
age. What "image problem,” Mr.
Enright, are you talking about?
The Greeks at the University of
Pittsburgh promote and support
charity events throughout the en-
tire school year. This, in turn,
only benefits the local communi-

the average Greek has an image,
it should be one which typifies
leadership, friendship, and one
that always extends a helping
hand. This is not to say Pitt
Greeks do not "party." Students,
Greeks and non—greeks, across
this campus and across this coun-
try, celebrate by means of parties,
tailgates, etc. Is this such a
wrongdoing? _

The ”Saving of the Seats" goes
hand in hand with the Greeks.
We are there to promote school
spirit and to show support to our

team. If it wasn't for the Pitt

Greeks, the student body would
have 2,500 more apathetic stu-
dents. In reality, Mr. Enright,we
are the underdog vs. the student
body.

Pitt Greeks do not promote
segregation on campus. If any-
thing, they do the opposite. They
promote togetherness, unity and
a willingness to strive to accom-
plish common goals. This could
not be done without the cooper-
ation and support of every Greek
house on campus. We encourage
all students to go Greek and to

The practice of pledges saving
seats for brothers is a long-
standing tradition at Pitt and na-
tionwide. So it disturbed me, be-
ing” a brother in a fraternity, to
read John Enright’s article, "Has
Pitt Football Become a Greek
Week Event?" especially since
gross assumptions about Greek
life were made by John. I shall,
to the best of my ability, try to
clear up some of John's miscon-
ceptions.

The assumption that pledges
save seats so that the brothers can
drink up to the last minute is
false. John does not understand
the meeting of fraternity. A frater-
nity is an association of men who
share common aspirations and
ideals, a brotherhood. Brother-
hood means togetherness, a

V strong bond of friendship. So, the  .4 _J

pledges save seats so that the
brotherhood can be together.

‘John's inference that all Greeks
get drunk before games was
another crass assumption and just
shows his veiled hostility. Also,
John's statement that the Greek
section limits his seating options

hope John is not a statistics major.

Indeed, the Greek system has
received some bad press lately,
mainly from narrow-minded jour-
nalists holding a grudge. Perhaps,
you are one of those pseudo-
journalists, John. Could it be
[that] you are holding a grudge?

I would not infringe on an or-

ganization's right to assemble in-

a certain area. I do not see any-
one demanding a seat with the
band that is not a band member.
I do not see anyone sitting across
from the "O” on a Friday night
with a Yuppie haircut. The sim-
ple reason is [that] one would feel
out of place if not a member of
that group. So, the conclusion is
that Enright was looking for trou-
ble. Something to cry about.
Perhaps John should make more
friends.

The Greek system is an integral

Siouxsie and the Banshees release a fan-pleaser

By Jessica Coville
For the Pitt News

A sigh of relief resounded o'er
the land on Sept. 2 of this year,
when Siouxsie and the Banshees
released their latest album of
originals, Peepshow. For the truly
dedicated Siouxsie fans, ”|t’s
been a long time coming,” and
certainly worth the wait.

For those of you familiar with
the Pittsburgh music scene, you
will remember that the band
stopped here last year, promoting
their last album, Through the
Looking Glass. The album con-
sisted of covers from such artists
as Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop and the
Doors.

The last album of originals from
the Banshees, Tinderbox, was
released in 1986 and included
such hits as ”Cities in Dust” and
”92°.” Since then, the band has
only given us a smattering of
originals and has left us waiting
for the album.

The Banshees’ first perfor-
mance was the IOO Club Punk
Festival in London, Sept. 20,
1976. The band that night was
made up of: Siouxsie Sioux (vo-
cals), Steve Severin (guitar and
saxophone), Sid Vicious (drums)
and Marc Pironi (guitar). They
played an improvisational musi-
cal version of the ”Lord’s Prayer”
and finally stopped when the
band members became bored.

Nils Stevenson, former
manager of the Sex Pistols, took
on the Banshees, and in 1977,
Sid Vicious was replaced by Ken-
ny Morris. In 1978, they signed
with the Polydor label and played
to a sold—out show at the Round-
house in July. After the British
release of their debut album, The
Scream, the group sold out Ham-
mersmith Odeon in London.
From there, their career took off.

For you new Cure fans, lead
singer Robert Smith had a brief
moment with the Banshees as
their guitarist. This happened
when the Cure toured with the
Banshees. In a nothing less than
dramatic event, two Banshees
walked off the stage during the
first night of the tour. Sioux and
Severin decided to continue with
the tour and employed Robert
Smith to play guitar. Smith also
appeared on several albums of
the Banshees: Hyaena, and a live
album entitled Nocturne.

Siouxsie Sioux, probably one
of the most colorful artists of our
time, has also been one of the

most introverted and .reIuptant,to .~,

give interviews. When a_maga—
zine has approached her, she has
insisted that the whole band be
present for the interview, feeling
that this would keep the focus on
the band as a whole instead of
singling her out.

Siouxsie, a latchkey child since
the age of seven, said she had a
relatively normal childhood.

Nothing pointed to the fact that
she would be anything other than
normal. ”My mother still has
preconceptions of what a girl
should be like,” she said. ”She
doesn't think that music is a safe
thing and would like me to be a
secretary.” Well, Sioux did noth-
ing of the sort and, in fact, went
to the far end of the spectrum.

What one remembers most
about Siouxsie, the individual, is
her wild manner of dress. In the
beginning, she and the band
wore swastikas and leather.
Although some of the band still
wear leather occasionally, they
have dropped the swastikas be-
cause the band was rumored to
be linked with certain fascist
groups. Last year in her Pittsburgh
concert, she wore a red harlequin
outfit and a large, feathered mask.
With the release of Peepshow,
we can still see.a lady with a car-
nival of colors washing over her.

Peepshow is nothing short of
incredible. It is evident that much
thought went into the lyrics and
orchestration of each song. Every
tune can stand up on its own as
an excellent track.

The release of the album was

timed very well, as it coincides I

with Halloween, and most of the
songs on the album have an eerie
”Stephen King” quality about
them. -

I

iliiliiiiilli-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii##1##

 

”Rawhead and Bloodybones”
is a sinister poem about a mon-
ster living beneath the stairs.
Sioux almost whispers the song,
and at the end we can hear a
small child's whimpers adding to
the dramatic effect of the song.

”Carouse|” is a song about a

scary carnival ride of the same
name. Listening to the track, one
feels as if he really were on a
carousel while Sioux croons
about ”the monsters that whirl
and the colours that curl.”
- ”Last Beat of My Heart” is an
unusual love song from the Ban-
shees that incorporates the heart-
beat percussion of the band's
drummer, Budgie, and the beau-
tiful accordion playing from
newest band member, Martin
McCormick.

The most powerful, and my
personal favorite song from the
album is ”Rhapsody.” The tune
begins with the draw of a bow-
string ‘across the cello and the

melody of a wind flute playing
together beautifully. Sioux comes
in gently by singing, ’’In the soil
of our sadness.” With help from
Budgie and Severin, the song
gains rhythm as Sioux incor-
porates a children’s nursery
rhyme,
land, runs a crooked man...”

The intensity increases as she
gains volume with the lines, ”I
have seen all I want to, and I felt
all I want to.” In one of her most
powerful moments on the album,
Sioux then explodes in an almost
orgasmic cry of ”Rhapsody!” The
song ends where it began, with
McCarrick’s cello slowing us
down and bringing us back, and
all the while we can still hear
Sioux softly calling, ”We can
dream all we want to...” Thus,
the album itself ends with the
most provocative and intriguing
song. .
Watch for a possible Pittsburgh
concert date this fall.

In the next SHOWCASE...

Cocteau Twins, Social Distortion,
Kuntu Theatre, Candy Mountain and more.

The band spent time last year
opening shows for Love and
Rockets. They are now out in
support of the new album, warm-
ing up crowds for the Ramones.

Jane’s Addiction’s sound is very
comparable to the raucous, up-
beat, bluesy style of the Red Hot
Chili Peppers. They can rap and
rock you into an insane frenzy
just as easily as they can har-
monize and lull you off into
dream land.

/\/othing’s Shocking has a
natural progression to its tempo.
Starting out on ”Up The Beach”
with a sluggish, monotone sound,
the album increases in intensity
up to its turbulent peak with
”Standing In The Shower
Thinking,” which has to be most
representative of the album's wit-
ty, realistic, yet not too serious
tone.

From here, Jane's Addiction
takes us through withdrawal,
brings us back down slowly,
returns us to normalcy and bids

A us farewell on the jazzy, low-key

rendition of ”Thank You Boys.”

”Mountain Song” and ”Idiots
Rule” are two more obvious rip-
pers. They just instill the need in
you to perform some sort of
frivolous activity. You just have
to bounce around and release all
that pent-up energy.

For a band with such intense
originality to go unheard for so
long is unfortunate. Jane's Addic-
tion’s newest album is impressive
enough to give them their first
shot at popularity. It's a perfect
way to break into the music
scene.

Don't be astonished if you're
overcome with the tendency to
wildly fling yourself about the
house when listening to Noth-
ing’s Shocking. It has been
known to happen in severe cases
of ”Addiction!”

Wim Wenders explores the joyless life of an angel

By Kathy Condit

For The Pitt News

Wings of Desire, set in modern
Berlin, is a contemplative, brood-
ing story of societal alienation
and the search for individual hap-
piness. ”Joy has gone astray” in
Berlin, and it is up to every per-
son or angel to recapture it for
himself. a

in Wings of Desire, the-city and
its inhabitants are seen from the
unique perspective of two angels
who watch over daily life in the
city.

The perspective of the two an-
gels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and
Cassiel (Otto Sander) was the
most difficult part of the film for
the director, Wim Wenders, to
create. ”l’ve always imagined
that it had to be rather terrible to
be an angel,” Wenders said. ”To
live for an eternity and to be
present all the time. To live with
the essence of things — not to be
able to raise a cup of coffee and
drink it, or really touch
somebody.”

Wenders uses his ideas to cre-
ate angels far from the stereotyp-
ical ”guardians.”
Cassiel roam the streets of divid-
ed Berlin, passing into libraries,
homes and schools, continually
observant of the masses around
them. As they pass unseen
through the lives of the Berliners,
the audience is privileged to hear
their thoughts through the angels’
ears.

The two angels are at once om-
niscient and powerless, for their
only purpose is to observe and af-
firm the existence of the human
status quo. Although the angels
share sorrow for the human mis-
ery around them, they can only
listen and pray for the best.

Their neutrality and even impo-
tence are symbolized by their in-
ability to see colors (the first half
of the film is in black and white)
and their inability to hear any-
thing but thoughts.

Wings of Desire slowly
separates into three different but
well-integrated plot lines. One
story shows Cassiel as he follows
an aging writer around Berlin.
The old man, Homer (Curt Bois),
is searching for places and peo-
ple lost during World War II. This
subplot allows Wenders to reveal
the special nature of Berlin. In his
opinion, ”No other city is to such
an extent a symbol, a place of sur-
vival." A second subplot follows
an American film crew shooting
a Nazi movie around Berlin.
Peter Falk of Columbo fame plays
himself as a movie star.

The main story line follows
Damiel, as his desire to become
human intensifies. His desire to
experience life, rather than ob-
serve it, increases when he sees
the lovely and lonely Marion
(Solveig Dommartin.) She is a tra-
peze artist, performing an ”an—
gel” act at the Circus Alekan. He
follows her around the city,
listening to her most private
secrets and longings. Half in love,
he begins to see in color and
leave footprints. Although she is
unaware of him, she experiences

Damiel and S

a ”feeling of well—being’’ when
he is near.

Damiel eventually decides to
leave his immortality behind. He
searches the city for Marion and
finds her at last in a punk club.
The club scene features Nick
Cave and the Bad Seeds perform-
ing live, including unreleased

_ songs.

Wings of Desire is at once an
”art film” and a mood piece. It
has received critical acclaim
abroad, and Wenders won the
Best Director Award for it at the
Cannes Film Festival in 1987. It
is a must—see for those interested
in German history and culture,
Nick Cave fans, or anyone in-
terested in seeing an intellectual,
modern love story.

    

Damiel, an angel, watches over the Berlin woman he loves, Marion.

and drummer Steve Trettel from
Ohio. Harger primarily plays the
alto sax.

For a young group, they carry

a good deal of experience. Harg-
er has played locally with Larry
Coryell; Griswold has appeared
with Herbie Mann; Brown with
Larry Coryell, Herbie Hancock
and Stanley Turrentine; Venturi-
ni and Trettel with Modern
Times. '

The songs appearing on their
first album are ”Alfonso,”
”Adirondack,” ”Snowshoe,”
”Ghost Dancer” (composed by
Harger), ”Frontiers,” ”The Old
West at Night" and ”The Straight
Man” (composed by Griswold).

All in all, Radio Ranch is a well
put—together album, combining
jazz, rock and new age elements

into an eclectic total which is
relaxing and pleasant.

My only complaint about the
album — aside from that it ends
— is the overwhelming presence
of Harger’s saxophone. He just
hogs too many of the songs. I like
saxophone as much as any jazz
aficionado, but there's so much
sax that as I listened to Radio
Ranch, I expected Cybill
Shepherd to burst into the room
at any moment with a bottle of
Dom and two glasses.

The first song, ”Alfonso,” is not
particularly inspired, being com-
prised of too much sax and some

generic drumming; high energy, .

yes, butjusta typical upbeat jazz
tune. ”Adirondack” produces a
wintery feeling, with a much
more refined sax presence, and
contains just a hint of Pat Methe-
ny’s influence on the group.

p a great first record

THE Pl'lT NEWS, Thursday, September 29, I988

”Snowshoe" again shows a bit
of Metheny in the use of the sax
and wailing ha|f—vocals, but it is
classy in a New York sense. ”The
Old West at Night” has an over-
bearing sax presence in the be-
ginning of the song which
drowns out the bass and drums,
then it turns slow and mellow like
an evening in front of a fireplace
with a loved one. The sax again
dominates the middle of the tune
but sounds nice anyway, moody
and sad.

”Frontiers” contains a nostalgic
piano ramble, with the sax in the
background for once, and is kind
of like a happy-ending tune for a
movie. ”The Straight Man” is a
sad piano piece, with keyboardist
Griswold finally showing what

he's capable of. The saxophone H

most part and manages to

produce the correct mood. The
bass is better than good. Harger’s
sax reappears too loudly towards
the end of the song, which ends
too abruptly.

”Ghost Dancer” is all right,
even though the beginning and
end of the tune don't fit in with
the rest of the album. Doubtless
Arizona yuppies will like the
American Indian rattles and slight
Latin pitch, but the song makes
me wonder if Harger was in need
of a song to finish the album and
used it for filler.

I'll be interested in listening to
their next album, and I also look
forward to hearing them in con-
cert. When Harger mellows on
the saxophone a bit and adds a
trumpet player and another gui-
tar player, their quality should in-
crease noticeably.

THE PITT NEWS

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

The period of time immediate-
ly following a loss is always tough
for a football team. Following a
loss at the hands of an archrival
is 10 times harder.

Last Saturday, West Virginia
came into Pitt Stadium riding a
three-game winning streak (three
games where they outscored op-
ponents 162-48). Both teams
were ranked in the Associated
Press Top 20 (WVU No. 11 and
Pitt No. 16). It was the Moun-
taineers who came away with a
31-10 win.

This week, Pitt (2-1) coach
Mike Gottfried will try to get his
troops ready for their first road
game of the season, against the
Boston College Eagles (1-3).

”We did do a lot of good things
in the West Virginia ball game,”
Gottfried said. ”There were a
couple of big plays that West Vir-
ginia made that we didn't make,
so consequently we lost to a good
football team.

”Any time you lose, it's going
to hurt. We just have to rebound
this week. We told our players
not to get too hung up on wins
and losses, just improve.”

Boston College is a team that
has given the Panthers trouble the
last two times they have played.
In 1985, the Eagles defeated Pitt
29-21 at Pitt Stadium. Last sea-
son, BC again came to Pittsburgh
and left with a 13-10 win.

”I really feel that [Boston Col-
lege] is a good football team,”
Gottfried said. ”They have a lot
of guys returning [six starters on
both offense and defense]. We
had a tough game with them last
year, and I expect the same kind
of game this year.”

Last season, the Eagles were led
by the strong arm of quarterback
Mike Power (six for 13 for 89
yards) and running backjim Bell
(139 rushing yards).

’’I remember Bell from last
year,” Gottfried said. ”He’s a
very strong runner. He gave us all
kinds of problems.”

”Boston College has a very
good attack,” Pitt cornerback
Alonzo Hampton said. ”They.run
well and pass well. We'll just
have to go out this week prepared
for everything and ready to play.’’

Power was benched earlier this
season in favor of Mark Kam-
phaus. In last week's game

0 To the local chapter of T.M.P.
(which could be taken to stand
for Too Much Philly) and other
area Philadelphia Eagles fans in
this area who howled and cursed
and screamed in protest over The
Pitt News’ prediction of a .500
season for the team: Well, fellas,
maybe we were a bit too
generous.

OCBS recently withdrew its
offer to USSR basketball coach
Alexander Gomelsky to join its
NFL Today broadcasting crew
due to racist remarks that he re-

against Texas Christian, Kam-
phaus broke his jaw, giving Pow-
er another chance.

”Power has done very well for
them,” Gottfried said. ”They
throw the ball well and can do a
lot of things.”

The Eagles have had a tough
early schedule. Their opening
game was against the USC Tro-
jans (a 34-7 loss) which was fol-
lowed by Cincinnati (a 41-7 win).

Next came a heartbreaking loss
to Penn State (23-20), and last
week a whitewashing by TCU
(31-17). Yet, coach Jack Bicknell
still feels his team can compete
with anyone.

’’I think we have the chance to
be a good football team, but I
can't prove it,” Bicknell said.
”We are struggling, but we're
playing hard. I'm not crying
about anything. We’ve just run
into some teams that, on the days
that we play them, are playing
very, very well. I really like the
team, and I think we're dan-
gerous.”

One of the most dangerous
players is senior wide receiver
Tom Waddle. So far this season,
Waddle has caught 32 passes for
384 yards and five touchdowns.

”I think he is the best pure
receiver we have ever had,” Bick-
nell said. ”I have never had a kid
look the ball in the hands like this
kid does. Everybody says you
have to run a 4.5 to be a receiver;
well, he runs a 4.7, and I'll tell
you, he's as good as anybody
has. He just makes plays.”

Right now, the Panthers have
traded the penalty bug for the in-
jury disease. Quarterback Darnell
Dickerson was poked in the eye
during the third quarter of the
WVU game but is ready for this
week. Backup QB Larry Wanke
severely injured his shoulder late
in the game and may not make
the trip. Tailback Adam Walker
reinjured his groin and will not
practice this week, but he should
be ready by Saturday.

The defense has been hit just as
hard. Sophomore Marc Spindler,
senior Burt Grossman and fresh-
man Ricardo McDonald have
sprained ankles and may not be
100 percent for the game.

”We have a lot of injuries, but
I don’t think any more than any
other team has after three
games,” Gottfried said. ”We’ll
just have to work through them.”

The kicking game is still a big

cently made at the XXIV Olym-
piad.

After the Soviets’ 82-76 victo-
ry, Gomelsky, in discussing how
playing NBA teams had helped
his team in preparing for the
Olympics, was quoted as saying,
”In my opinion, the US. is a
good team, a strong team. We
like to play 12 or 15 games

‘ against them a year to catch up.
Many years ago, we in very bad
problem. U.S. has black players
that jump too fast and too high.”

Gome|sky’s attorney, Jimmy
”The Cossack” Snydersky, said
his client wasn't interested in the
job anyway.

0 A capable quarterback like
Jay Schroeder has proven the fact
that the L.A. Raiders were just a
time bomb waiting to explode.

Pitt women’s volleyball 

team looks to improve

8-3 record against WVU 

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The bump, set and spike ver-
sion of the Backyard Brawl takes
place on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. as
the Pitt women's volleyball team
takes on the West Virginia Moun-
taineers. .

The match marks the initial
home appearance of the 8-3 Lady
Panthers, who will be out to ex-
tend their home-court winning
streak to 16. Their last loss at
home was to Penn State on Oct.
19, 1986.

Last week in Morgantown, All-
American candidate Denise
Frawley totaled 12 kills in power-
ing Pitt to victory in three straight
games. The Lady Panthers will
look to Frawley for another strong
performance on Saturday.

Several other Pitt standouts will
be expected to make major con-
tributions. Kelly Matheis has been

near the top of the Pitt stat sheet
in kills and digs all year long,
while Nora Mulvihill has made
her presence felt at the middle
blocker position. Setter Janelle
Lantagne will be relied upon to
keep the offense running at peak
performance.

The only foreseen problem for
the Lady Panthers going into the
match is the status of Lori Silk,
questionable due to a strained
back muscle. Silk has proved in-
valuable to the Lady Panthers
with her leadership as well as all-
around play.

The Mountaineers come into
the match with a record of 8-4
and a reputation as an up-and-
coming team.

Despite their victory over the
Mountaineers, the Lady Panthers
will not take them lightly. Interim
coach Sue Hoover rattled off
three reasons why she feels her

With fo teams in Top 20, the
PAC-10 replaces SEC as top league

Move over Southeastern Con-
ference, here comes the Pac-10.
For the past several years, the SEC
has been the undisputed king of
conferences. But, with the emer-
gence of Oregon (yes, Oregon) as
a Top 20 team this week, the
Pac-10 now has four teams (U SC,
UCLA and Washington are the
others) in the Top 20. Oregon
may not last for very long, but the
Bruins and Trojans just may be
the nation's premier teams.

Last week — 5-4 (.555)

For the year — 27-10 (.730)

Oregon-34, San Diego State-21

There was once talk of San Diego
State someday joining the Pac-10, but
the Aztecs have fallen on hard times.
Oregon gets to spend at least one
more week in the Top 20.

Rutgers-31, Cincinnati-21

ls Rutgers for real? They'll have
plenty of chances to prove it, with
games against Syracuse, Boston Col-
lege, Pitt and West Virginia remain-
ing. A 7-4 season is a possibility for
the Scarlet Knights.

ls WVU for real? No doubt. An
11-O season is a very real possibility.

Tennis team wins in dramatic fashion

' By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
women's tennis team eeked out
a dramatic 5-4 victory against 1n-
diana University of Pennsylvania
on Tuesday to pull within one
game of .500 for the season.

The tenacious IUP squad took
the Lady Panthers down to the
wire, but in the end, a dramatic
doubles victory by Jill Cohen and
Bonnie Kartzman proved to be
the deciding factor in a Pitt win,
putting the Panthers at 3-4 for the
season.

With the match tied 4-4 after
IUP had come back to take the
first two doubles matches played,
the entire day's events came
down to the No. 2 doubles
match, involving Cohen, Kartz-
man, and lUP’s Sue Sippel and
Kiki Hussian. The latter pair took
the first set, 6-3, setting the stage

,4 n.um~ii& Ala A"1t"»-‘."."..“.“r'¢ 5 " 4 " ~

for a Pitt comeback.

Pitt claimed the top spot in the
second match 6-4 but were
quickly staring up at Sippel and
Hussian in the rubber match, and
at the critical point in that en-
counter, they were down 5-6
with IUP serving. But the Pitt duo
came back to even things out,
breaking Indiana and sending the
match into a tie breaker.

The Lady Panthers jumped
ahead 3-1 to begin extra play, but
IUP came back to tie things at 3-3
and seemingly grab the momen-
tum at the same time. In the end,
though, a clutch return shot by
Cohen put the visitors on top to
stay, and they eventually closed
out their opposition with the fi-
nal score 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. That vic-
tory enabled Pitt to record their
third victory of the season.

Although Kartzman and Cohen
were in a position to grab most
of the glory for the day, several

performances impressed
Dieffenbach.
No. 1 singles player Tracy

Feltingoff played the ”best match
of her career,” according to
coach George Dieffenbach, in
defeating an extremely talented
freshman by the name of Lee
Rideout (7-5, 6-4). No. 2 Lady
Panther Lisa Kinney battled not
only lUP’s Hussian but also a
bout with a stomach sickness to
pull off a 6-2, 7-6 triumph. San-
dy Hunt and Cohen lost in the
next one—on—one matches, but
both played well enough to im-
press Dieffenbach, as did Kartz-
man , a senior co-captain, and
Chris Orie, who won her first
match of the season at sixth
singles.

’’It was a very, very competitive
situation in which we were hang-
ing on to the lead,’’ Dieffenbach
said. ’’It took a lot of character
and pride to pull out this match.

REGISTRATION
BEGINS ON

”Everyone played well, and all-
in-all, it was a total team effort.”

Dieffenbach’s crew had a
tough weekend, so the victory
two days ago was certainly ap-
preciated by Pitt. The Lady Pan-
thers lost to Temple and Drexel
by identical 7-2 scores on Friday
and Saturday and then came back
to drop a 6-3 match at Bucknell
University on Sunday.

Tuesday brought relief in the
form of a 9-0 demolition of
Robert Morris on the road.

NOTES: The squad will travel
to Trenton State on Friday to take
part in the Eastern Collegiate
Women's Tennis Championship.
Their next home match will be
on Tuesday, Oct. 11, against
West Virginia University.

OLYMPICS  
Ben Johnson admits to using three

types of drugs before being DQ’ed

By Phil Brown

Associated Press Writer

SEOUL, South Korea —- Ben
Johnson acknowledged taking
three different types of medica-
tion, including some containing
partially restricted drugs, before
his now-disgraced Olympic
100-meter race, a doctor in the
doping-control office said Wed-
nesday.

Dr. Lee In-joon added,
however, that use of these drugs
for therapeutic purposes is per-
mitted, and Johnson ”never told
me he had taken any anabolic
steroids.”

’’If used properly, as a ther-
apeutic, that's fine with us,” Lee,
doping-control coordinator for
track and field at the Seoul
Games, said in an interview with
The Associated Press. ”Larger
amounts than what we consider
a therapeutic level could be sus-
picious.”

After urinalysis revealed the
presence of muscle-building ana-
bolic steroids, Johnson lost his
goldmedal and his 9.79-second
world record and rushed back to
Canada. He told The Boston
Globe, during the flight from

Seoul, that he was innocent, but
he has not publicly elaborated on
the case.

Lee said he ”had a hunch”

from talking tojohnson about 30
minutes after Saturday's race that
he might test positive.

”You get a feeling when you
see an athlete. Some have no
idea what's going on in doping
control, and some are very defen-
sive,” Lee said. ’’I would say Mr.
Johnson was more defensive, but
maybe he's just that kind of guy.
I don't know.”

Johnson's agents have contend-
ed someone must have spiked a
bottle of sarsaparilla that Johnson
carried to the stadium, but offi-
cials have said the drug tests did
not bear out that defense.

Sports Illustrated and The New
York Daily News reported that

’ Dr. George M. ”Jamie” Asta-

phan, a member of Johnson's
Olympic entourage, has ad-
ministered steroids tojohnson in
the past and is a firm believer in
giving athletes performance-
enhancing drugs.

’’I never gave him any,” Asta-
phan told reporters at the Toron-
to airport. ”He never told me he
took any.”

After suffering a hamstring pull, W

Johnson sought out Astaphan in
May on the island nation of St.
Kitts, near Johnson's native Jamai-
ca. Sports Illustrated said it
learned that Johnson knowingly
received steroid treatments then.

When he rejoined the Canadi-
an track team in Europe later, he
was in surprisingly ”great shape,”
his coach, Charlie Francis, was
quoted as saying this summer.

«But Gerald Mach, head of the

Canadian Track and Field Associ-
ation, said Francis always replied
’’absolutely no” to questions
about possible drug use in con-

nection with Johnson's
phenomenal improvements in re-
cent years.

Lee said that while waiting to
be tested, Johnson displayed
none of the usual happy emo-
tions of gold medal winners.

He said he asked Johnson if he
had taken any medication in the
three days before Saturday's race,

- . v a n

vvon-«J .‘.vv9v\ou.:

and Johnson replied that he had
taken three different types, one of
them an injection.

Some of the medication inc|ud— 

ed ”partial|y banned” substances
known as corticosteroids, Lee
said, but Johnson said the medi-
cation was for therapeutic
purposes.

The international Olympic
Committee announced only the
finding of anabolic steroids. IOC
spokeswoman Michele Verdier
said the presence of one banned
drug is enough for disqualifica-
tion, without analysis for any
other substances.

Lee said Johnson never even
mentioned the gold medal. He
said Johnson had to spend about
1 hour in the waiting room where
athletes go if they are unable to
produce a urine sample im-
mediately.

Lee said athletes areobserved
during urination to ensure that no
other sample is substituted. The
athletes then divide the sample
into ”A” and ”B” bottles and seal
the bottles, which are coded so
that the laboratory has no idea
who produced the sample, he
said. _

in raising the possibility of a
spiked drink, Johnson's agents
said Johnson found a smelly,
sticky substance at the bottom of
his sarsaparilla bottle, but it later
was washedout by Astaphan.

Lyle Makosky, the top sports
official of the Canadian govern-
ment, said that based on the
laboratory results for Johnson,
”the tampering option is no
defense.”

”This particular result, which is
technically and scientifically
solid, shows extended or repeat-
ed use over time” of anabolic
steroids, Makosky added.

The chemical found in the test
already had been broken down
by natural processes in the body,
which would not have been the
case if it had been in a drink
taken only hours before the dop-
ing test, he said.

our first home match of the

’’Secondly, I feel the team will
be fired up in front of the home
crowd.

”And last but not least, this

In Hoover's first two weeks at
the helm of the Lady Panthers,
the team is a perfect 6-0. With
each practice and each match,
she is becoming more assured of
her abilities, as well as those of
the team.

”Every match, I feel more con-

input of how things are going

U. S. basketball team '5 loss only the
‘second in history of the Olympics

By Jim O'Connell

AP Basketball Writer

SEOUL, South Korea — This is
not 1972, and this was no fluke.
The 82-76 loss to the Soviet
[Union in the Olympic basketball
semifinals Wednesday was the
fourth straight failure in major in-
ternational tournaments for U.S.
men's teams so accustomed to
ruling the world.

And, according to the coach
who will play the Americans for
the Olympic bronze medal
Thursday night (Thursday morn-
ing EDT), there is good reason:
The Americans are behind the
times.

”The U.S. is a very young, in-
experienced team  and they

‘paid the penalty for preparing the
team within the United States,”
said Australian coach Adrian
Hurley. 1

The 1987 World University
Games and the World Junior
Championships both meant silver
medals to Yugoslavia’s golds. The
Pan Am Games were a showcase
for Oscar Schmidt, the shooter
from Brazil who flew back with
a gold medal while the United

‘States again accepted silver.

But the loss to the Soviet Un-
ion came in the Olympics. The
only blemish on the U.S. basket-
ball record in the Games had
been a loss to the Soviets in 1972
that was so tainted the silver me-
dals were never accepted + they

 

remain in a bank vault in Munich.

There was nothing tainted
about this Soviet victory. The
United States was beaten by a
team that was never bothered by
the U.S.'s most potent weapon —
pressure defense — and a team
which showed there is no substi-
tute for international experience
and competition.

The U.S. team should ”get out
of the country and play under in-
ternational rules and with inter-
national referees. That talent isn't
enough. You've got to play,’’ said
Hurley.

Well before the Olympics be-
gan, U.S. coach John Thompson
was telling people that the system
used to select the team was out
of date, especially considering
that the better international teams
were using American training
methods and expertise.

”Every year my team has nice .

competition with U.S. college
basketball teams,” Soviet coach
Alexander Gomelski said. ”We
played one year ago against Mil-
waukee Bucks and recently
against Atlanta Hawks.”

”United States basketball, NBA
basketball help my country. I'm
happy. Thank you, United States
basketball.”

The United States did make a
run at the Soviets on Wednesday
and got within two points mid-
way through the second half af-
ter trailing by 14 just after
halftime. But the Soviets held off

and leaders form Black Student Organizations

all challenges, and the United
States was faced with the possi-
bility of no medal, let alone no
gold.

’’I think they gave all they
could to represent their country,
and I think that's all their coun-
try can actually ask of them,”
Thompson said. ”We came here
to win the gold medal and were
extremely disappointed we
didn't, but you get in it with an
opportunity to win and the pos-
sibility of losing.”

The future could be brighter,
however. This tournament was
probably the last played under
rules where NBA players are
banned. FIBA, the sport's interna-
tional governing body, meets
next month, and the motion to al-
low NBA players is expected to
pass easily.

”That league has all the big
names,” Soviet guard Sharunas
Marchlionis said. ”But it is differ-
ent. If they play it will be no
contest.”

Just as it was for so many years.

AP Track Writer

SEOUL, South Korea —— When
sprinter Joe DeLoach was 18,
he decided to attend the
University of Houston because
Carl Lewis was there.

”I’d met Carl at a meet at
Rice and had gotten his auto-
graph,” DeLoach said. ”He
was my idol and still is.”

That doesn't mean he can't
beat him.

DeLoach showed that
friendship only goes so far,
when he swept past Lewis
with 10 meters left and won
the Olympic 200-meter dash
Wednesday.

After DeLoach crossed the
finish line in 19.75 seconds
Wednesday, breaking Lewis’
Olympic record of 19.80 and
breaking -Lewis’ heart,
DeLoach was emotionally
torn.

He wanted to win the gold
medal, but he knew that if he

Friendship only goes
so far for DeLoach
and idol, Carl Lewis

did, it would disrupt Lewis’
chance to repeat his four gold-
medal performance of 1984.
Lewis already had won the
100-meter dash, getting the
gold when Ben Johnson was
disqualified for using steroids,
and wonthe long jump.

The reprieve in the 100 gave
him another chance for_
another gold sweep, with the
200 and 400-meter relay re-
maining.

The biggest obstacle in Lewis’
path appeared to be DeLoach, his
friend and training partner, who
had beaten him in the 200 at the
U.S. trials in July.

After the 200 victory, DeLoach
knew he would be asked the in-
evitable question: How did it feel
to beat Lewis under those circum-
stances?

”Where our friendship is con-
cerned, I hate that,” DeLoach
said. ”There are going to be some
disappointments, some joys.

”I’m happy I won the gold me-

The Panther soccer team
upped their record to 3-2 fol-
lowing a 2-0 shutout over
Geneva College last night at
Pitt Stadium.

Throughout the first half, the
game looked like a carbon
copy of last Sunday's Ohio
State game (a 2-1 Pitt victory),
as both teams had difficulty
possessing the ball.

Before the game, Pitt coach
Joe Luxbacher stressed the key
to Pitt victory would be to
eliminate such miscues. ”We
need to play good fundamen-
tal soccer and eliminate mis-
takes both offensively and
defensively,” Luxbacher said.

Neither team could generate
any offensive threats until mid-
way through the first half,
when Pitt squandered several
opportunities. Geneva goalie
Chris Thornton made several
stops, including a sliding save
of a Brian Hammond shot to
keep the Panthers off the
scoreboard.

Late in the opening half,
both teams began to pick up
the pace offensively, yet
neither team could muster a

goal. Offsides penalties killed
several Pitt threats as the game
remained scoreless at the half.
”We got beaten to the ball
in the first half. Every 50-50
ball went their way,” senior
sweeper Dan Liberati said.

Early in the second half, the
Panthers settled down and be-
gan stuffing the ball deep in
Geneva territory. Just under
two , minutes had elapsed
when Liberati buried a strike
from the 20 into the top right
corner of the net to give Pitt a
1‘0 advantage.

Pitt maintained offensive
pressure, narrowly missing tal-
lies on strong blasts from Mike
Blatz, Mike Laus, Scott Arm-
strong and Marc Mostincx.

Despite not cashing in on
such opportunities, the Pan-
thers remained in control.
Strong defensive efforts kept
the ball on the Geneva side of
the midfield stripe.

Sophomore goalie Tim
Sobleman had little difficulty
in the nets, as he faced little

pressure from Geneva
throughout most of the game.
Pitt cushioned their lead late

in the half as freshman striker

Mike Laus pounded a low
drive past Thornton to make

the score 2-0.

Consistent pressure con-
tinued, but the Panthers could
not add to the margin. The
Golden Tornadoes never
threatened again and Pitt
claimed their second consecu-
tive victory.

Luxbacher was pleased with
the Panthers’ play in the sec-
ond half/’We moved the ball
much better, settled down a
bit and got relaxed,” he said.

Pitt opens their Big East
schedule Saturday against a
more formidable opponent,

national power Seton Hall. As-
sistant coach’ Bob Campbell is
optimistic.

”We need to neutralize
them with tight defense,”
Campbell said. ”Finishing
chances and putting them in
the back ofthe net is the key.”

dal. To me, it really means a lot.
But I hate to think that I was the
one to come between Carl's
dream.”

If it was any consolation to
DeLoach, he and Lewis now
have a lot in common.

Each has an Olympic gold me-
dal in the 200. Each shares the
American record. Each owns the
best time ever run at sea level.
And each has the No. 2 perfor-
mance in history, behind only the
world record of 19.72, set by
Pietro Mennea of Italy at the alti-
tude of Mexico City in 1979.

Most important, their friend-
ship is intact. '

”CarI has been a real inspira-
tion to me; he's been there for
me, he's helped me to stay en-
couraged and he's been my train-
ing partner,” DeLoach said. ”Just
being around that type of person
 has helped my confidence."

Lewis was just as praiseworthy.

”Joe ran a tremendous race,”
he said. ’’I feel very good for him.

I'm proud of him. But he's had to
do it himself.”

It didn't matter any longer that 

Lewis had been responsible, in
part, for costing DeLoach one
year of college eligibility. It hap-

pened when DeLoach decided to

go to Houston and met with
Coach Tom Tellez.

The meeting was at DeLoach’s
house, and Tellez brought along
Lewis and Kirk Baptiste, another

Houston sprinter. Under NCAA ‘xv

regulations, athletes could not ac-
company a coach on a visit to a
prospect.

The infraction cost DeLoach his
freshman ‘year of eligibility. It
might have slowed his progress,
but the Olympic gold made him
forget that.

Despite DeLoach’s victory,
Tellez was not convinced that
DeLoach is faster than Lewis.

”I still think Carl is faster,”
Tellez said.

Then why did Lewis lose?

”Fatigue,” Tellez said. ”He has
to be tired.”

This Year, Europe Will Have A

New Fashi

This fall Pittsburgh will be a center for European vintage and
military fashion. As Avalon Vintage Clothing brings to
Pittsburgh thousands of fine European vintage clothin g items.
Avalon Vintage Clothing, a U.S. based company, has

opened one of the largest vintage cloth ing and European
military surplus fashion stores in the East. Being the fifth
such store opened by owner operator Stuart Mcbean, it
brings to Pittsburgh 25 years of combined experience in the
American and European vintage clothing business, plus

on Capitol!

numerous domestic and European military items that have
been completely redesigned by some of America's most crea-
tive designers. _

4,000 garments from the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's of
both U.S. and European origins will be presented clean,
pressed and ready to wear. Many of the European items have
scarcely been sold in the U.S.A. whereas they are seen on the
streets of every European capitol. All at prices you can afford
without straining yourpocketbook.
