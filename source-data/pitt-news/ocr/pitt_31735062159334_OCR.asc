The student body says in the
same breath today “go get ’em”
and “good-bye” at the pre-game
pep rally in Soldiers and Sailors

' Memorial Hall.

A University-wide dismissal
for the rally during fifth hour—12:30
to 1330 p.m.-has been sanctioned
by school officials.

The dual aim of the final pep
session of the grid year is to
generate enthusiasm for tomorrow's
battle with the Panthers’ tradi-
tional rivals from Penn State and
to give the 19 seniors, who wind
up their college careers; against
the Nittany Lions, a resounding
sendoff.

Student v*Congress, sponsor of
the rallies, has sent invitations to
the departing footballers, express-
ing the hope that students will turn
out in force "to publicly wish you
(the senior griddersl the best.”

Mike Milligan's Panthers, who know from Shakespearerthat
"tis better to fall before the lion than the wolf,” are expected to

do neither when they host Penn
game of the season.

On the contrary, the Pitts, who have lost the last two times

out, are figured to use the Lions to feed the wolf that has been ’

hanging around their door since the Ohio State game.

In doing so, the Milligan Men will take up where they left off

last year in their longtime grid

When they trot out on the Stad-
ium turf tomorrow, the boys from
Mt. Nittany will be sixzpoint under-
dogs. This fact isn’t advantageous
to the Panthers, who have played
best ball when figured to be on
the short end of the score.

However, in itself, this is not
sufficient to preclude a Pitt vic-
tory. Such a turn of fortune could
only result from the fact that there
has been no bowl talk echoing along
Nittany’s slopes. this year. The
Pitts would be a sure shoo-in if
there was.

As it stands, Pitt will have to
take Fran Rogel and company as
they‘ are. Rogel, State's 206 pound

Patents offreshmen will be introduced to college life, as their
children see it, tonight, at the Chancellor’s Reception. i

Since the first reception in 1921, it hasbecome a tradition of
the University for the Chancellor to meet the parents of freshmen
sometime during the fall semester.

The deans of the undergraduate schools will share the speak-
er’s rostrum with Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, who will give

the main address of the evening.

Chancellor fitzgerald has been

Pitt News Managing Editor

Two main objections have been raised in answer to the over-
whelming student-faculty support of this writer’s proposal for a
Christmas dance in the Commons Room. The arguments for such
an affair were advanced in the first article printed several weeks
ago, so this space will be devoted primarily to stating and ans-

: Before Leaving-u C

Student enthusiasm gets its last fling this afternoon and tomor-
row at the rally and the final football game before holing up for
the winter. .

The student body should make the most ofit, particularly since
there are several prizes at stake. ‘

 First, of course, is the general goal‘ of this final grid weekend
-the defeat of Penn State. The Panthers have come through two
tough games only to face Penn State, a team and followers to whom

' a win Saturday would "make” the season.

As has been expressed here before, the team does get a boost
from the Saturday spirit generated at a Friday rally. There’s no
particular reason why we should make Nittany fans happy with a
victory. Certainly the football team doesn’t want to. ‘

Nineteen gridders on the stage this noon, more than ahalfdozen

‘, of them winding up four tough years of Panther football, share the

«spotlight at the rally. All deserve the plaudits a big gathering of
their fellow students can give them.

Thirdly, they will, by their actions today, likely determine what
policy the administration will follow nextfall in the way of rallies,
pre and post, and, at the same time, lay out a path for next year's
Student Congress to follow.

For, it was emphasized by both Congress and the deans, that
the free time secured for rallies this fall would hold only for this

, fall. The deans will undoubtedly take under advisement again next

‘ fall a new request for rally time. Their decision will,:more than

anything else, be based on the conduct and success of this fall’s

We notice that Congress as a body has taken cognizance of the
futility and wasted time of post-game celebrations particularly
against teams the Panthers do _not face as decided underdogs. The
legislators voted unanimously Monday that no victory rally would
be held Monday should Pitt post the expected win Saturday.

So, with the football season closing Saturday and with any
Monday festivities wisely outlawed by Congress, the air of ex-
citement will quiet next week. ,

Admittedly, when the football team hibernates during the win-
ter, school-wide enthusiasm hides away with it. Students should
make the best of this final whirl.

Every ear someone associates
the crow ed conditions at Univer-

sity dances with the broad expanse
of space in the Commons Room and
suggests that we hold dances there.
The idea has always met opposition
in the past, but since it keeps pop-
ping up, we asked students around
the University whether they thought
we should hold dances in the Com-
mons Room.

Ed Turek, Bus. Ad. ’5l: "They
don’t allow smoking, necking, or
drinking in the Commons Room.
They might as wellglet us dance.”

Jack Boulton, Engineering '50:
"Ithink that we should have dances
there. Because of the architectural
beauty and the money that has been
put into building it, the~Room should
be utilized by the students.”

Jean Keller, Education '51: "I
think it’s a splendid idea, particu-
larly at Christmas time. With Guy
Lombardo and evergreens it would
be the most wonderful dance in the
United States.”

Jim Masood, College ’50: "Dances
are a good idea. We should use all
that space for something.”

Kay Komoroski, College '53: “A
dance in the Commons Room would
bring everyone at the University
closer together because it would be
in the heart of the Cathedral.”

Bill Hazlett. Bus. Ad. ’502 "I
think that the traditional atm‘os phete
of the, Commons Room should be
upheld. It could be spoiled by dances,
although some of the activity that
goes on there spoils it now.”

wering the dissenting opinions.
Mrs. Patricia Shields struck the
first blow shortly after the article
appeared, although she admitted
that the scheme had possibilities.
Appearing at a Student Congress
meeting, she claimed that when
funds were being solicited for the
construction of the Cathedral, pro-
posals for the use of the Commons
Room did not include dances, and

to hold a dance there would be to

breakfaith with the original donors.
She feared that if students advo-
cated and carried out adance-“sud-
denly. . .in a way of defiance. . . ”
these people would be outraged
and withdraw their support from the
current campaign.

Women Object

Miss Adrienne Aldissert, like
Mrs. Shields an assistant to the
dean of women, objects on similar
grounds. As advisor to Commons
Room Council, Miss Aldissert
claimed that to have a dance in the
Commons Room’ would obviate the
the necessity for a dance floor in
the proposed Student Center, caus-
ing prospective donors to withold
funds for its construction.
Commons Room Council thought
that was a pretty involved line of
reasoning. So do 1.

Both women, like most adminis-
tration members, are in constant
dread of offending anyone who
might give money to the building
campaign. Certainly, to a reason-
able extent, that is a practical
idea. But it can be, and in this
case; has been, carried too far.

Customs Changed

In the first place, most of the
original major donors to the Uni-
versity are dead. That's a rather
bald statement, I’ll admit, but if
these donors did have objections
to holding a dance in the so-called
‘heart of the University,’ it can’t
hurt them where they are. And how

does Mrs. Shields know that they
would object?» Ideas and customs
have changed since the 1920's.
With everyone from the greenest
freshman clear up to the Chancellor
crying for more space, why does
all that space have to go to waste
because it upsets some mid-Vic-
torian opinidns on ‘good taste?’

Miss Aldissert’s allegation hard-
ly merits refuting. One dance at
Christmas time is not going to
wreck the plans for the Student
Center.

And, speaking of the Student
Center, have you seen the latest
edition of the plans for that build-
ing? I’ll wager that no more than
twenty-five students have. And as
planned,this building will be about
as much a center of student acti-
vity as the Commons Room is now.
We'll have more on that in ’a later
column.

Support Needed

But for now, buttonhole Student
Congress members in the- Tuck
Shops; speak to the deans of men
and women and their assistants;
even your instructors have'com-
mented favorably on the dance
proposal. If you want a dance» that
really looks and ‘feels like a Pitt
dance instead of a hotel dance that
some of your friends are attending,
plug this angle. W

Student Congress is considering

, it. One of their advisors, at least,

is strongly in favor of it. All it
‘needs is the necessary push from
below. If student support is lack-
ing, any plans will fall through
just like the Philadelphia train trip.
If the people who are in a position
to sponsor a dance feel that they
have some chance for success, I
guarantee you’ll have the finest,
most enjoyable dance since your
senior prom.

exploiting our forests and have
taken the coal deposits...and now

Shows Apathy 
For Monday Rally

Doing a complete turnabout, the now harmonious Student'Con-
gress went on record Monday against sponsoring a victory cele-
bration in the event of a victory over Penn State tomorrow.

The previous bitter wrangling over sending protest letters to
the board of deans to denounce the sanctioned one hour celebra-
tions was forgotten. The student legislature passed a motion of

Dario Icardi’s by acclamation.

This congressional decision does
not effect the pep rally scheduled
for the fifth period today.

Tunnel Compromise

In place of the victory celebra-
tion, Congress compromised on a
halftime tunnel at the Stadium. The
tunnel is to be formed by students
at the entrance to the locker rooms
as the players come out for the
second half.

The motion not to sponsor a vic-
tory celebration came about after
Dr. John Ferguson, advisor to Con-
gress, said he was not in favor of
rallies after games. “Give the
players two hours off, but not the
students,” he declared. ,

"I’llprobably lose my goodgname
and get thrown out ofPitt for this,”
Dr. Ferguson laughed.

Néw Alignments

The harmony in Congress, prob-
ably temporary,resulted when mem-
bers of the minority group aligned
themselves with the conservative
majority bloc. It was this minority
group that fought for two-hour vic-
tory rallies and tried to have the
letter of protest sent to the board
of deans. "

Several other proposals to hold
victory rallies in the Stadium, on
the Bigelow Blvd. side of the Ca-
thedral, immediately following the
game, or on Saturday evening were
also defeated.

Stucbnt Congress heard com-
plaints about lack of space tn the

port,Men’s Council plans to clear
out severalrooms to be used as rec-
reational and card playing rooms.

Ta rget of
Pitt Band

Saturday, the Pitt band will go_
a-hunting the Nittany Lion in their
review of fall and winter sports.

Following a special swing fan-
fare, the band swings into "Ahunt-
ing We Will Go,” and forms a gun
that is supposed to be aimed at
the Lion.

While in the formation the band
plays an excerpt from "Peter and
the Wolf,” at the end of which there‘
is a shot that signifies the shooting
of the Lion. This is followed by
"The Funeral March."

Next the band will salute the
horse racing. With the sound of the
familiar bugle call heard at the
tracks, the band forms a racetrack.
The tuba section lines up as the
entries in the.race to end all races.

With ashot and a cry of"They’re
Off” by the band, the tubas gallop
around the track. The music for this
formation is "William Tell Over-
ture.”

As the last man crosses the fin-
ish line, the band plays "The Old

 In Disputed Election

iay’s meeting.

Student Congress decided unanimously to retain the five un-
1 ‘ constitutionally elected members for the rest of the term at Mon-

President Flora Diemert started the meeting with her report of

.last Spring’s election. She pointed out that of the 420 members of

the Pharmacy School, only 62 voted.

.If these 62 votes are subtracted

-from the totals, according to a

0 check made by Miss Diemert and
other members of Congress, the pre-
vious order of the candidates re-
mains unchanged.
_ Patricia Leix then moved that

I. "in view of the President’s report,
we keep the five unconstitutionally
elected members on Congress.”

The motion drew no discussion
and was passed unanimously.

The unconstitutionality of the
elections was based on the Phar-
macy 'School’s voting last spring.
Congress’ by-laws makes no pro-
vision for that school’s vote.

Miss Mildred Ditty, of the speech
department and parliamentarian
for Congress, pointed out that it

. was Congress’ decision, by a two-
 gthirds vote, if the members should
be retained.

Another resignation, purchase
of a gavel, and discussion about
the orientation program highlighted
the Nov. 15 meeting of Men’s Coun-
cil.

Council accepted the resignation
of John F. Fulton, sophomore rep-
resentative and secretary of Coun-
cil. Fulton resigned because his
heavy scholastic schedule "does
not-allow the time to do a good job
as secretary and representative.”

A new sophomore representative
and secretary will be elected at
the next meeting of Council.

Bill Blockste in moved that Coun-
cil purchase a gavel to facilitate
keeping order at the meetings. The
motion was carried.

Tom Burkhardt reported that 583
freshmen took the customs exami-
nation Friday, Nov. 11. Those fresh-
men who did not take the test are
to appear before the Council orien-
tation committee, who will decide
when the test may be given to them.

Joe Wolfe, senior representative
and chairman of the customs and
traditions committee, informed
Council that his committee will re-
port on the orientation program
after the evaluation sheets given
out .at the customs test are ex-
amined.

Council also Considered the es-
tablishment of a “men’s lounge and
a committee was appointed to work
on the idea. Proposals for the
awarding of Panther Keys will be
voted upon at the next meeting. In
addition a contribution of $10 was
made to Religion In Life Week.

Psi Omega, PiKA Meet
For All-Campus Title

Psi Omega and PiKA clash Fri-
day afternoon for the All-Campus
football championship. The two
teams qualified for the tilt by win-
ning the titles of their respective
divisions on Wednesday.

Undefeated’ this season, the Psi
Orriega’s took the IM title by routing
Delta Sigma Delta, 38-6.

After the Delts kicked off, Bob
Wicks rifled passes tojocko Woods
and Bud Remaley, to spearhead the
first score in five plays. The Psi
O’s didn’t let up after their first
score and with Wicks and Joe Ste-
wart doing most of the passing and
receiving they had a 25-0 lead at
halftime.

Avert Shutout

The champs added two TD's in
the second half and the Delta Sigs
averted a shutout by tallying on a
pass from Jack Nomberg to Dave
Noble in the final quarter.

PiKA won the fraternity title
from Delta Tau Delta by not ad-i
vancing the ball across their op-
ponents goal line.

After four quarters the score was

deadlocked, 0-0.
Diving Catch
Both squads then agreed that the
team that penetrated the others
territory the deepest in two over-
time periods would be the winner
if no points were scored.
In the second overtime period,

. PiKA?s Marty Kohr made a diving

catch of Al Lochinicar’s 40-yard
heave and fell on the Delt 25. The
victors worked their way to the six
where a goal line stand halted their
drive and the Delts took over.

Two desperate passes failed to
click and the game ended with PiKA
being declared the victor.

Bimbo on
  The Bench?

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

According to the experts, Bimbo Cecconi should have been sitting

P on a bench this season. That is, this was their opinion two years ago.

In his freshman and sophomore years, Bimbo was one of Pitt's better

football players. He‘ was a shifty runner right from the start.
t trouble, however,seemed to be that ‘ “ ‘ "

his passes looped like high fungo
hits off a baseball bat —- and be-
sides, he was just too small.
Sowhen Bimbo came to fall train-
ing camp in his junior year, it was
talked around that the little man

I was due to fade.

Much Competition

There were plenty of tailbacks
in camp who had more heft and
throw better than Bimbo.
There was Bobby Lee, Tony Di-
.Matteo, and Lindy Lauro, to men-
tion only a few.
1 Close observers shook their

7 theads sadly and reflected, "It’s

too bad, but the little guy has too
much to handle this time.”

The days passed, and just as
everyone expected, Bimbo’s rivals,
outside of DiMatteo who was con-
tinually hampered with injuries,
performed capably in practice ses-
sions. But there was one thing no-
body had reckoned with. Bimbo’s
determination.

Practiced Hard
The undersized tailback must
have known his own shortcomings,

I for be practiced hard at his pass-

ing until his throws no longer bore
any trace of the Cecconi trademark.
In ‘fact, his tosses looked extra-
ordinarily sharp.

‘By the time the opening game
with Southern Methodist rolled
around, Mike Milligan and his
coaching staffdecided that they
had no choice but to give the Bim
another crack at the starting tail-

 back job. The result was that Bim-

bo came off the field that after-
noon with a neat .500 pitching aver-

His main

    

age, having completed nine for 18.
Within a few weeks he had one

the highest passing percent-
ages in the nation.

of

Gets Praise

Of course, from then on in there
was no holding Bimbo down. Being
a small man, he never did become
a "great” passer. But his running
has taken up enough room in the
greatness department to more than
make up for any small flaws in his
aerial game. '

Bill Dailey, ex-All-American back
from Minnesota, who was in town
Saturday to broadcast the Pitt-
Gopher game, took a few squints
at Cecconi" and immediately an-
nounced:"This fellow is the great-
est little lalfback Ihave ever seen.”

And Bimbo was playing under
handicap of injuries at the time.
But as R.X. Graham of Pitt’s Ath-
letic Committee says, "You have
to hit him on the head with an ax
and split him in two before he’ll
stop playing.”

Thus, it would seem that the
little guy has not lived up to the
predictions of the experts who peg-
ged him for a bench rider. And they
happily report that the crow, in
this case, tasted delicious.

for New York and the IC4A meet
at Van Courtlandt Park on Monday

By 18-6 Win

Phi Qelta Theta scored a con-
vincing l8-_g6 victory over the Pi
.-Lams Wednesday to bag third place
in the IF league playoffs.

Larry Brent again proved his
worth as a passer when he con-
nected with his receivers for all
three Delt counters. Glue-fingered
Jim Stopford received two of Brent’s
TD passes while Bernie Newman
snagged the other.

The lone Pi Lam score occured_
when Dan Benjamin tossed to Mur-

. ray Cohen, who executed the finest
bit of running seen all day in scor-
ing. It took three quarters for the

‘ Lams to count this score.

After the explosive second quarter

1 in which they scored two touch-
downs, the Delts breezed through
the rest of the game.

Eps Capture
Fifth Place

That the best defense against a
passing attack is a hard charging
Q line was proved on Wednesday when
the Phi Eps defeated Phi Kappa,
19-14, for fifth place in the IF league.
Time and again the Phi Eps line,
led by Sam Shapiro, broke through
to break_ up the feared passing at-
tack of the Phi Kaps.
Al Finesman scored all three
touchdowns on two passes from
Miltjacobs and one from Joe Miles.

With the onrushing Phi Ep line
giving him no time to pass, Tippy
Gentille, ace Phi Kap passer, did
a remarkable job in completing two
touchdown throws.

knocked breathless before subduing
an inspired Mountaineer team, 20-7.

Once more the frosh will travel
by bus, but this week’s two-hour
journey should be a little easier
thanthe 14-hour cruise of lastweek.
The freshmen departed at about 8
o’clock this morning.

The Panther first year men work-
ed out during the week without the
guidance of their head coach. Im-
mediately following the Army game
last Friday, Schmitt took off for
Philadelphia to scout Penn State,
and has given the varsity his time
and charts ofplays duringthe week.

There_ were no serious casualties
at Army, but the frosh will play
their finale without the services of
Joe Schmidt, their regular quarter-
back for most of the season.

Schmidt was not able to make
the Army trip, either. Two days be-
fore the game, X-rays showed that
the pain in his side was a fractured
rib. Merle DeLuca will replace Sch-
midt in the lineup.

Swamis Smash

Crystal Balls 4
If Not Records

The Pitt News’ yogis, fed up
with the unpredictableness of their
crystal balls, have tossed them
out and are relying on other meth-
\\ ods this week to
s e l e c t football
‘winners.

1 Anyone ventur-

  
  
 
  
  

'ng near the
News’ office
should therefore

beware of crystal
ball de ris and swami sorcery. It
is not known how the swamis made
their selections this week, but
"Kope” Kopelman was seen in-
tently studying the formation of the
grounds in a cup of Tuck Shop
coffee. _

This is the final week for selec-
tions, and the yogis are involved
in a tight race for first place honors.
Will Doerge holds a slight lead at
present, but a slump on his part
while any of the runnerups have a
good week, could swing the yogi
title in their favor.

av Lois FOIGHT
When a freshman. hops on an elevator to the 10th floor for his

1787.

«first hour class, he may never think of his frosh counterpart of

That is, he may not unless he pauses during the customs exam

to envy the guys who went to school

when there were no traditions.

When a fellow thought about“
entering the Pittsburgh Academy
back in the 1790’s he had first read
the advertisement in the Pittsburgh
Gazette, the early news sheet, an-
nouncing the opening of the term.
This included the request that a
student bring his own goose quills,

He expected to make his own
arithmetic and copybooks, and
there was great rivalry and pride
among the students in the making
of their books. '3

The first freshmen came from a
community of only 400 families

had to walk uphill from the Point

that lived at the river fork. They 

located very near to where Kauf-
mann’s department store is today.
It is very probable that instead
of wearing dinks, these early frosh
had to work out their orientation
by chopping wood to keep the fire

Rig News Then

The 1790 frosh was not only the
center of attention at school, but
provided the town with front page
news. The Pittsburgh Academy was
first chartered institution of higher‘
learning west of the Alleghenies.

This was at a time when it was
said that a squirrel could have
gone from the Alleghenies to the
Pacific without ever touching the
ground. No wonder the new school
was so important.

An example is a hotice in the '
Pittsburgh Gazette in which the
editor apologizes forpostponing the
news of a murder trial. The front
page news for that week was a dis-
cussion between instructors at the
Academy of whether it was to re-
main a liberal arts college or grow
into an expanding university. Until
the discussion was settled the
murder trial had to wait! _

Added to the regular liberal arts
courses the freshmen could take
was a course in the growth of Amer-
ican history and igs democratic
ideals.
