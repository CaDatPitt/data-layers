Considering an Activities Fee Increase

Last month’s Student Government Board——Black
Action Society confrontation over budgeting demon-
strated three things: — .

-—BAS was incompetent in putting together
feasible 1979-80 budget.

——SGB was incompetent in dealing with such in-
competency.

—-Student Government is in desperate need of
more money to hand out to student organizations.

While the first two points are a matter of personal
opinion, the third is more than just, an educated
guess.

The SGB receives approximately $272,960 each
year to allocate to student organizations. This
money is generated via a $12 student activities fee
that has not been changed since it was approved in
1970. Now, student government is saying it needs to
raise the fee in order to dole out more money to
organization and groups and avoid arguments over
funding procedures, such as BAS’s complaint over a
$1,000 cut last month. In thise case, student govern-
ment is right. A quick look at comparable fees at
other schools is evidence that Pitt is way behind in
providing money for student programming and other
activities. .

Ohio State, which is known for excellence in
programming concerts, plays and movies, has a $50
fee. _ _

Duquesne employs a unique system. The average

\ full-time student (12-15 credits) pays a “university

Thornburgh Names
Prof to Investigation  

fee” of $151, a student carrying 9-ll credits pays
$106 and so on down the line to the student with
three credits who still pays $40 per term.

Student organizations at Penn State are not funded
by any fee. Money is appropriated from the general
fund of the university anda special committee run by
both administrators and students is responsible for
the allocations process.

  Tom Kukucka

columnist-at-large

These universities, as a result of better systems

and/ or larger fees, do not experience as much back-
biting and complaining from their student
organizations at budget time as Pitt does. And

1 programming is well organized and not hampered by
the contract problemsand questions of priority that
plagued the Pitt Union Program Council last year.
Even minor programming, such as an outdoor cafe
or movies that cost $1 or more at Pitt, is usually free
at these school. 1 I ‘

Student Government is talking over any possible
increase with the Office of Student Activities. While
it is too soon to assign an appropriate dollar figure

yet, increases of as little as $3 a term to as much as
$12 have been discussed. A $12 increase would still
make Pitt’s fee less than half Ohio State’s.

While no one likes to see the price of anything go 1.

up, the typical Pitt student whose tuition increases
amount to $300 over four years should not complain
about a few dollars more for the activities‘ fee.

Tuition increases do not necessarily improve the
quality of education——they only maintain it. But an
increase in the student activities feewould surely im-
prove the quality of programming and the status of
student organization here.

Terry Milani, associate director of student ac-

5 tivities, says that no “formal” talks concerning-the

increase will take place this summer and that such a
change is “much more complex” than just adding
more money to the fund. So, any change in the fee
would probably take place, at the earliest, next win-

ter. In addition, says Milani, budget priorities would .

“We also have to deal with the decision of how to
spend the money,” Milani says.

“It’s like the guy who gets a salary increase from’

$50,000 a year to $90,000,” said SGB member Kim
Watterson. “He’s not going to go out and spend
money like crazy—he’s going to be more careful of
how he spends‘ his money.”

A few dollars more for student activities could
make life out of the classroom a lot easier. And a
better social life at Pitt could make those “substan.
tial” tuition increases easier to stomach. '

A Pitt professor, who once
served as a consultant for
Metropolitan Edison, has been
named to a special Three Mile
Island investigating commission
set up by Governor Richard
Thornburgh. Metropolitan Edison
is the operator of the crippled
nuclear power plant.

. Dr. Neil Wald, chairman of Pitt’s
Department of Radiation Health. is
one of six citizen members of the 14
member commission. The eight
other participants are members of
Thornburgh’s cabinet and Lt.
Governor Scranton, who will chair
the commission.

The formation of the commission
was immediately critized in some
circles with some of that criticism
aimed at Wald.

A spokesman for a group called
the Three Mile Island Alert, which

has opposed nuclear power plants
long before the TMI problems,
questioned the validity of naming a
former Metropolitan Edison con-
sultant (Wald) to the commission.

Wald said yesterday his involved
with Metropolitan Edison dealt
primarily with workers’ problems
“and that his, past association will
not affect his views while working
with the commission.

“Every reactor facility, to qualify
for a license, must have plans for
dealing with accidents...they need
a medical backup,” he said.

‘Wald said he never met with any
Metropolitan Edison people or
went to the TMI facility while
serving as a consultant.

Wald completed his consulting
duties with the power company in
1974, he said.

Thornburgh said while an-
nouncing the appointments, the
“commission will assess the
economic, environmental and
health effects of the Three Mile
Island incident and develop courses
of action to bring recovery from any
adverse effects."

While the governor's commis-
sion conducts their investigation of
the TMI incident, numerous other
state, federal and local groups will
be investigation the action of the
state government during the
emergency.

In a related story, Secretary of
Agriculture Penrose Hallowell

Police Release Rape Suspect

By JEFF COUCH
, Pitt News Staff Writer 1

Charges were dropped Mon-
day against a Hill District-man
accused of raping an 18-year-
woman at knife point in Scaife
Hall April 10. The rape
occurred in the fourth ﬂoor of
Scaife, a university building
across from Pitt Stadium.

An assistant district attorney
said the charges were dropped

against Anthony B. Eaves, 24,
of 800 Whitesides Road,
because the results of a lineup
were inconclusive. Unless new
evidence is introduced in the
case, it is unlikely that Eaves
will be charged again, he
added.

The rape case evoked pro-
tests by students, faculty and
staff members concerning

security at Scaife.

“If stricter security mea-
sures are not implemented at
Scaife, there wil not only be an
atmosphere of apprehension,
fear and anger, but total
disillusionment which will un-
doubtedly trigger further
actions by the occupants of
Scaife Hal , ” said a letter to the
Pitt News signed .by Scaife
occupants.

Gun Control Legislation Unconstitutional  

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staffwriter
Gun control legislation and the
philosophy behind it “impinges on
our basic freedoms” and is
unconstitutional, according to Mar-

jorie Provan, President of the’

Allegheny County Sportsman’s
League.

Provan, ‘who is also one of two
legislative representatives for the
Pennsylvania Riﬂe and Pistol
Association, made the remarks at
the Allegheny County League of

‘Women Voters annual meeting and

conference.

The Second Amendment of the
Constitution, which involves the
right of Americans to “keep and
bear arms,” is supposed to protect
the private individual from any
attempt by the government to take
away their weapons, she said.

,“The limitation (provided by the
Bill of Rights) was not placed on
the people, it was placed" on the
government,” she said. “The
limitation of government is the
essence of freedom.” '

Provan said the Second
Amendment was a very important

one to the nation’s forefathers.

“This principle, placed only
secondto the right to freedom of
speech (First Amendment) . . . .
that’s how important itis,” she
said.

Provan also said national gun
control legislation cannot be
enacted because states have
soverignity over the federal
government and most states
guarantee its citizens the right to
possess arms.

The Pennsylvania Constitution,
for example, states in Article 1,
Section one, that the right to bear

arms “shall not be questioned,”
according to Provan. I

Registration of hand guns is just
as bad as outlawing them, she said.

She used several countries to
illustrate thepharm that results
from requiring the registration of
handguns.

In Nazi Germany, she said, the
German people could not over-
throw Hitler because they had no
weapons since he used official,
registration records to learn who
had guns and conﬁscated them.

Great Britain, where private
ownership of guns was banned,

was left defenseless at the time the
Nazis invaded during World War
II, she said.

Instead of taking guns away from
American citizens, gun laws should
be aimed at criminals, according to
Provan.

“We must crack down on
criminals, not police and citizens,”
she said. “Blaming guns for
crimes is the same as blaming
pencils for errors.”

Opinion

Thursday, May 24, 1979-Page 3

Only
Half Right

Following a recent court decision that ruled Dan
White, the former San Francisco councilman who
.. shot Mayor George Moscone and city supervisor
Harvey Milk last December, guilty of manslaughter
instead of murder, gays-in that city caused mass riots
and violence.

if Gays in San Francisco, an estimated one-sixth of

the population there, saw the decision as a blow to
gay rights as Milk was the first homosexual to hold a

Guest.Column

major public office. And the fact that the decision
was handed down on Monday, which would have
been Milk’s 49th birthday, added impetus to the
outrage.

It is indeed a tragedy that Moscone and Milk were
killed, but this does not condone the unwarranted
destructiveness of Bay area gays. ‘ Milk was not shot
as an act of prejudice toward his homosexuality.
There is no plausible reason for treating him as a
martyr to a cause. There were no mass ‘demon-
strations on the fact that Moscone, a heterosexual
was murdered. "

While we do not necessarily condone the actions of
Anita Bryant and the Dade County legislature in
their prejudice against homosexuals, we do find the
simplemindedness of the San Francisco gay com-
munity appalling.

To remember Milk as an outstanding political
leader and as an upstanding citizen who did not com-
promise his sexual preferences is an image we should
all recall. To label him as a martyr because of his
homosexuality is a false assumption, a misleading
label that is being shamefully exploited and per-
petrated.

Whether White was insane or temporarily
deranged at the time of the shootings is still being
speculated. Evidentally, his real rage was geared at
Moscone, who refused to reinstate him after White
was resigned voluntarily from his post. Milk was

shot simply because he occupied what had formerly
been White’s office.
Whatever White’s true reasons for the shootings,

Milk’s homosexuality was not the reason he was‘

killed, just as Moscone’s heterosexuality was not the
reason, he was shot. ‘

Gays in this country come across enough kinds of
actual prejudice that it would seem particularly
ludicrous and surprising that they are engaging in
this blatant case of reverse discrimination—mour-
ning Milk for the wrong reason. The right reasons
are more than enough.

From Good Ship Lollypop to SALT II Treaty '

. three appeared,

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Shirley Temple Black spoke on
campus last week. She's the
iplomat-mother-lecturer who’s
the same little girl with curls, and
pretty starched lace white dresses
who made all those successful
movies in the 1930's.

I believe that the entire audience
expected that same little girl of
perfection to walk out on stage
after she was introduced. Instead,
a plump, 51-year-old mother of
and spoke on

everything from her movie career
to the SALT II Treaty between the
USA and Russia. Even though the
Qaudience might have been a little
disappointed that they weren’t
treated to a special rendition of
“The Good Ship Lollypop,” it was
an hour ﬁlled with entertainment

' and reminiscing.

Admitting she has been an avid
Republican since she was ten years
old, the former ambassador to

Ghana wasted no time in siding
against the current Carter admin-
istration and its major policies.
“I’m tired of putting in and never
getting anything back,” she ‘stated

as her reason for being opposed to
the Middle East Treaty between
Egypt and Israel. She also
commented that she is skeptical
about the SALT II Treaty because
of the lack of sufficient surveillance
means by the United States.

The stateswoman Mrs. Black
explained that she never liked the
movie star world of Shirley Temple.
She said that that little girl in white
lace was not really her. “I was in
jeans and always climbing a tree,”

she said. To demonstrate how she,

deﬁed the model Shirley Temple
role, she told how she once visited
Eleanor Roosevelt at the Roose-
velt’s Georgia home and shot the
first lady in the rear with a pebble
from her sling shot. “Secret
servicemen were looking every-
where for a gunman, but no one
saw me—except my mother, and
when we got back to the hotel, she
got me in the same place where I
got Eleanor!” she laughed.

Mrs. Black said that she was
aware that the United States was
going to recognize mainland China
months before President Carter
actually made the announcement.

She said that she was attending

war games in Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania, when she learned the
information from a senior military

official. Although she said that she
wasn’t opposed to the United
States recognizing that 900 million
people exist, she added that she
was opposed to granting China full
diplomatic relations. She said that
in regard to our friendship with
Taiwan, the United States should
have waited until those two nations
had settled their differences,
before this country should have
made a final diplomatic decision.
As expected, Mrs. Black said
that she is a supporter of the Equal
Rights Amendment. When asked
if she would favor women being
drafted if the latter is reinstated,

‘ badly.

she replied that she is not in favor
/of the draft. However, after
several minutes of hesitation and
needless explanation, she admitted
that she believes women should be
drafted if the draft starts again.
Although she commented that
recently she found herself in the
White House “female, Black, and
unemployed,” Shirley Temple
Black doesn’t seem to be doing so
I believe that most of the
audience were there to see the idol
of their childhoods, and not a
former Ambassador and states-
woman who has known eight
presidents. We remembered the

beautiful little girl in “The Littlest
Princess,” and not the woman who,
served her country in Africa. She
said that protocol was rotten (she
was chief of protocol for the United
States, too) for Jimmy Carter’s
inauguration, but we didn’t care.
She is down on the oil companies
for the gas problem, but what else
is new? $0 is everyone else. No
matter how hard she tries, she’ll
always be eight years old to the
majority of us.

Emergency Procedure Not So ‘Successful’

“Police Rise to Meet Failure”
seemed a particularly appropriate
lead to Jeff Couch’s article
describing the “success” of the
emergency procedures in effect
during the May 2nd outage.
Although I read “campus buildings
were evacuated in about one hour
and twenty minutes,” this was not
true for all buildings on campus.-

E’S NO DA

 

As a staff employee in a major
administrative office located in an
upper-campus building, I can
report that no one notiﬁed us of
what happened nor to evacuate the
building.

Campus policemen did beat on
the elevator doors to determine if
anyone were trapped, but to my
knowledge neither offered assis-
tance nor provided temporary
lighting for any persons attempting
to leave the building. At 5 p.m.
when another woman and I left the

. building, we had to make our way

down the stairs in nearly total
darkness. A secretary who was
detained by her supervisor until

after 5 p.m. had to go down the
stairs alone in the dark. Although
the situation in this building was
one of potential disaster, for-
tunately no injuries were reported.

I hope other campus buildings did
not experience similar conditions.

I'm calling attention to what may
be described as merely a “lack of
communications” not as a criticism
of the campus police but to perhaps
alert responsible
officials to the hazards inherent in a
well meaning but ineffective
emergency procedure. '

No Privacy in Ladies’ Room

I would like to use this column to
direct my complaint to the head of
the maintenance department at the
Cathedral of Learning. Please tell
me whey you chose males to clean
the ladies’ rooms.

Maybe this complaint will not
seem so silly after I remind you of
all the rapes in Oakland, especially
at the University of Pittsburgh. I
do not thing it is paranoid or
unreasonable of me to say that it is
an uncomfortable feeling (to say
the least) to walk into a ladies’
room and see a ,man standing

there. -And at this point what I
V ﬂashes through my mind is, y“What

better place for a rapist to ﬁnd a
woman alone than in a bathroom?”

There is no sign outside the door
stating that maintenance are
cleaning; and for someone who has
ten minutes between classes, no
time to go to another ladies’, room.

But what is really infuriating is
when a maintenance man walks in
one door and out the other. Ladies’
rooms are not short cuts! I
sincerely feel that my privacy has
been invaded and would appreciate'
an explanation of this policy.
