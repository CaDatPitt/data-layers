them Harvard, Princeton, and
Johns Hopkins.

In spite 01' all his honors and
his high position as an educator,
Dr. ‘Bompiani is an unassuming
man. Much of his success as a
teacher is‘ laid to the fact that he
prepares his lectures in advance
and delivers them unhurriedly
without notes. He is noted for his

clarity of statement and his genius.

for simplifying otherwise complex
situations in mathematics.

He is married and the father of’

two daughters, the oldest a doctor
of biology and the other a student.
He makes his home in Rome when
not commuting.

Dr.‘ Bompiani taught in Rome
during the fascist regime and he
emphatically declares he was not
a fascist in his teaching or politics.
He_ states that education at the
University of Rome was bothered
by the fascists only in “the polit-
ical science department.” 

As for politics Dr. Bompiani is
just “not interested.” He does say,
however, that “the danger of com-
munism is not yet over in Italy.’’

Dr. Bompiani likes Pitt very
much so far. His colleagues, whom
he met Wednesday, he_ describes
as “nice.” He also appreciates
Pitt’s architecture, for he once
taught in a school of architecture.
For his new, ofﬁce and the green
"blackboard in his clas‘sﬁoom‘he ‘ex-
pressed admiration. - "

In regard to a comparison of
American and European educa-
tion, Dr. Bompiani said, “The two
systems canont be compared.” He
went on to explain that while our
system has two ‘semesters, in Eu-
rope the registration is for a year.
“The European systemis more ad-
vanced than the American in that
here you use the ﬁrst two years
of college for cultural subjects,
while in Europe this is done in
high school,” said Dr. Bompiani.

h Course,

Latest aciiition to the series of tests ‘taken by
men is the English Placement examination.

Dr. Putnam F. Jones, head of the English department, announced
that a new English course has been created in conjunction with the

new exam. It is English 01.

“English 01” is scheduled to meet once a week for two hours. -
Course of study for students assignedto this section is restricted .

to the teaching of remedial fundamentals. Students named to this

group were found lacking in the

bare necessities, so far as gram-

mar is concerned, Dr. Jones reports.

Of the 370 spring entrants who took the English Placement Ex-, ,

amination, 74 were found wantingé

in the basic essentials. This group,

will meet in sections of English
01' two hours each week, in addi-
tion to the regular three‘ hours
required of them in English 1, the
basic composition course. 1
Designed to gramma t i c all y
sharpen those with low‘ scores,
English 01 is the ﬁrst of a pos-
sible two courses to be scheduled

Dr. Jones reports that possibly
next term, an English course num-
bered 3 and 4 will be opened to
freshmen. High scorers on the

to this group’, which will include
the “very capable,” according to
the head of the- English depart-
ment.‘ '- ‘ “  ’ .
In commenting on the number
of students named to the sections

of English 01, Dr. Jones remarked

that 74 out of 370 is not ‘too. high A

a percentage. . ’

These 74 will be briefed in*su.ch* 
things as forms of verbs, the.‘

minimums of punctuation, se‘n-'

tence structure and related essen‘-.; 
tials. Such a sharpening of gram_- _ ,

mar backgrounds will enable’ the

students to progress more rapidly; Q

SITAGGERED TERMS SOLUTION
TO CONGRESS’S CONTINUITY

A suggestion was advanced recently by Student Congress
Adviser Louis‘ Johnston that some personnel of Student Con-
gre_ss"be carried over into the following year in order to give
some unity and continuity to the work of Congress. a

The suggestion seems so logical that the only question
_ would seem to be “Why hasn’t it already been done?” Every
year the membership of Congress is completely, or almost com-
pletely, changed. By the time a new Congress gets the feel
of its job half a year has gone by with little or nothing to show.

Little wonder that students complain that Student Con-
gress “never does anything.” It seldom is in a position to’ do
anything. It must spend most¢of its time learning about itself.
[ During the last few years outgoing Congresses have tried

~ to orient their successors by holding combined meetings of the
old and new bodies at theend of the year. The plan hasn’t been
an unqualiﬁed success. There just isn’t enough time at the end
of the year. '

Most distressing of all has been the lack of. continuity, in
‘Congress action from -year to year. One Congress would pur-
sue -a particular objective for the entire year only to see its

work lost because‘ the following Congress would forget orig-
, e attempt made by last year’s
Congress to reform «its own basisof representation. It tackled
the problem witha freak ‘-“proportional representation” plan
~ which gave men twice as many seats on Congress as women.
They proposed the change as the ﬁrst step in a complete change
of awkward and often absurd method of representation and
V nomination that was written into the original Congress -consti-

One such example was th

“proportional” amendment passed, but the other
promised changes have never been mentioned since. Why? Be-
cause there is no one on this year’s Congress who is interested

rst time that‘ staggeredmembership has
been proposed. It seems to come up almost annually. But noth-
ing is ‘ever done. For that lack of action the cumbersome sys-
tem of nominations is mainly responsible.
At present-the systemcalls for a nominating
picked by Student Congress to nominate the candidates for
, Congress. Sounds confusing‘! It is. And until that nominating
procedure is somehow revised there doesn’t seem much possi-
bility of making some arrangement where by Congress can put
a little sustained eﬁort into its work.

Sense-Les  

By LES GALLAGHER

I was talking to my friend, Asa
O’Toole the other day. As usual
he was out making the fast buck.
He was handing out matches be-
hind Syria Mosque to those who
had just ﬁnished the long haul
through the lines of registration.
During the giving away of the
free ‘matches I asked my cold
friend who stood there in the
wind and the hail and the howl-
ing elements, “How much‘ you
make an hour?” He handed out a
couple of more books of matches
and addressed his. following re-
marks toward me, but with a voice
loud enough to be heard by the
passing gentry. “It ain’t the dough,
it’s the chance to ‘study people.

Here printed for all to "read
are the more important excerpts
from Asa’s match distribution
speech behind the Mosque called
Syria. He classified the passing
parade into three separate cater-
gories when it comes to accept-
ing a book of matches, for free.

Too Much for Some

First there isithe surprized. The
one that just can’t believe that
you are giving little old him "a
free book of matches. Orlthe one
who is just‘ plain dumbfounded. He
has staggered through a couple of
hundred lines grabbing a ‘couple
of hundred car/ds which are all
but defaced by a couple of hun-
dred holes. He has been stamped,
vamped and cramped by a reg-
istration system" which started in
Afghanistan and is‘ now being-
successfully carried on in a base-
m e n t b_ y Egyptian-speaking
Greeks. At last he emerges from
this screaming mass of humanity.’
At last his last card is stamped
and he tears himself loose from
this university ritual on a dance
ﬂoor and he breaks. out the last
door, wildeyed. Here a cold,'win-
tercoat-wrapped ﬁgure pushes a
free booklet of" matches at him.
It is too‘ much to comprehend. The
victim screams, “Why, Why?”
. . . and then quietly goes insane.

The second type is the skeptic.
This is the type who has ﬁgured
that registration ' has worked
much too smoothly and here is
the catch.

He thinks maybe that it is the
hospitalization group who just a
few minutes before broke his arm
to prove to him, the _beneﬁts,
numerous and otherwise of their
handy hospitalization plan. See-
ing that his body is not, once
again, subject to attack, this type
will then reach timidly‘ for his
pack of matches. -Another’ type of
skeptic is the one which has been
affected by Mrs. Goodworth, or
some such name. Everytime he
sees a hustler on the corner he
immediately suspects that it is
third party literature and will
have no part of it.

Can’? Believe l'l' . .

The third type is the plutocrat,
the millionaire, they ..might not
have the million but they have
the air. Every time that little cold
Asa would offerthis type a pack
from his cold, numb, little ﬁngers
they would look far to the right
and over his head‘ saying, “no
thanks, I have a lighter.” Of this
type, Asa bit two and horribly
maimed a third.

All in al1.Asa sums up his re-
marks with the theory that peo-
ple just can’t believe in some-
thing for nothing. Little women
when offered their matches would
shrink back from the doner with
the remark, “Ohhhh,” and then

add, “I don‘t smoke, thank you.” A

I then asked Asa, who I think
is just about the smartest kid in
school, what he thought about the
registration procedure, what with
his working so close to it at the
back door there; Asa looked at
me a second and after that see-
ond’s thought, he breathed and
said, “It’s_ Quick.”

Answer to Problem 

system of grades and igradin

More than a few educators are of the opinion that, as-litl
stands now, grades are not a true indication of the studentlsl

real learning power.

The complaint is not new,
stead of from students sporting low grades, it carriesconsider-’

ably more authority.

Below are reprinted two methods by which college*tea’ch-'
ers propose to make grades truly indicative-of student achieve’-

ment.

' NEVV YORK, N._Y.—(I.P.)—
De—emphasizing of grades in
American education and re-
emphasizing ‘.‘over‘-all achieve-
ment” wereadvocated by Dr.
Edwin S. Burdell,’ director of
The Cooper Union, in his An-
nual Report, just issued.”

“The only valid educational phi-
losophy for the 20th century,” Dr.
Burdell said, is based on _an aware-
ness “that a college education is

‘not set up to teach subject matter
but to teach students. It is my hope

that the ‘day may come in’ Amer-
ican education when less atten-
tion will be given to grades in

subject matter courses and when.

academic progress will be record-
ed in terms of over-all achieve-
ment. .

“It seems to me that in the long
run we will know more about a
student’s real promise as an en-
gineer if, after four semesters of
basic courses in physics,_<chemis—
try, mathematics, and humanities,
he is given a comprehensive ex-
amination of T a problem—solving
type,” Dr. Burdell wrote. .

“He will then demonstrate not
how sharp a memory he has, but
how keen and resourceful‘ and in-
genious he is in bringing togeth-
er all the theory and facts to
which he has been exposed to bear

on solving a reasonable problem .

involving all of these elements.”

At the end of the student?s jun-
ior year, Dr.‘,Burdell advocated he
should be given another problem-
solving type of examination. And
ﬁnally, the stu’dent’s graduation
“should depend upon whether or
not he can solve at the close of
hissenior year a variety of prob-
lems which he is most likely to
be called upon to solve during’ his
early years of practice.

“I am told it is too much to hope
for one school of engineering to
adopt such criteria while 167
schools adhere to the present sys-
tem of clock—hour credits. Ob-,
viously, there is an opportunity
for the professional associations
to make recommendations for ex-
periments along these lines.”

Final Tryouts

Final tryouts .1 the Pitt Play-
ers forthcoming production “Can-
dida” by George Bernard Shaw.
are scheduled for 2:30 this after-
noon in room 1217 CL.

The theme of the play centers
about a young poet who becomes
infatuated with the wife of a min-
ister. The minister believes the
poet’s attentions toward his wife
so much poppycock, until the mat-
ter is brought to a head by the
poet. ‘

"When forced to choose between
the poet and her husband, Can-
dida, the minister’s wife, chooses
her" husband and she proves the
poet can‘ never love‘ anyone be-
cause he lives and loves with his
imagination alone.

Thirty-ﬁve junior women, who
successfully completed their ﬁrst
semester-in the School of Nurs-
ing, were honored at a capping
ceremony Sunday, Jan. 30 at Ma-
gee Hall.

Dr. Charles J. Barone, profes-
sor and chairman of the depart-
ment of obsetetrics, was guest
speaker. Caps were presented by
Dean Ruth Kuehn, head of the
School of Nursing,

The ceremony, attended by par-

ents and friends of the students,
is symbolic of the stuaent’s suc-
cessful completion of the ﬁrst
semester in the School of Nursing.
Prior to the ﬁrst semester, the stu-
dent is given a complete nursing
uniform minus a cap.

With the capping of the entire
35 members of the class, a new
School of Nursing record has been
set. This marks the ﬁrst time that
the entire ﬁrst semester class has
passed and been capped.

Lover‘ Fenn wiped out the lone

Petro Lost One
Petro’s undefeated college rec-

ord was stopped by Fenn’s All-

American Bob Busby, who edged
Dick in the 100 and 220, setting
a pool mark of 52.5 seconds in
the former.‘

Mike Levine’s graduation
leaves a big gap in the distance
events, even though the transfer
of Petro to the 220 will deﬁnitely
bolster that event. But in the 440,
Grady will have to dig deep to
ﬁnd a replacement for Levine.
Mike’s only loss in that event was
to the sensational Busby.

Outstanding sophomores eligi-
ble for competition this semester
are Backstroker Herb Liebovitz,
Breast-stroker Norman Simeone,

“To bring ‘athletes to Pitt, the
students have to be ‘~ salesmen,
too. They have to sell the Uni-
versity and sell good athletes on

“Our two new eligibles are show-

port to the. 12th ﬂoor, Tues., Feb.

When the local talent isn’t roll-
ing the Freshmen and their
guests in the aisles, Wes Parker's
popular band will furnish the
music for dancers.

Mary McParlana, in charge of
decorations, revealed that the
decorations will center around an
ice ball theme. An ice igloo will
form the entrance to the ball-
room and a huge ice ball, sus-
pended from the balcony, will
sway over the heads of the danc-
ers. “N

dents, is $3.25 -per couple at the
