Panther To Appear Monday
With “Pretty Girl” Cover

The “pretty girl” cover has in-
vaded the Pitt Panther! Forsaking
the conventional humorous cartoon
cover, the June number of the Pan-
ther will startle its readers with a
cover graced by a dazzling, auburn
high
school boysdecide to go ..to college.
The cover is an exact reproduction
from an oil painting done by a
Notre Dame artist. You’ll.see it
Monday when the Panther prowls
again. «

For the ﬁrst time in several
months, since Cecil Trout’s outburst,
the Panther is including a - short
story, “Flunked by Proxy.” UDone
in a smooth and intriguing style, it
concerns a‘ young college professor
who learned a few things himself
in his classroom. Thus far the
author has eluded detection and the
faculty by using‘ the pseudonym,
“Regalsew.” _ .

Panther feature‘ writers, makin.g
their ﬁnal bow until. September,
have written their articles with.‘

boxing match between Pitt and Du-
quesne was not the first athletic
meet between the two schools, and he
discloses some startling facts on the
scholastic achievements of Pitt ath-
letes. “Theater," by (Marvin T.
Herrick; “Catching Eyery'thing,’.’ ‘by
Eddie Hirshberg; “Dressing Up,”
by Charles Goldstein, and other
features are especially interesting
as well as enlightening. .

. An unprecedented number of car-
toons will be in the issue, according
to Hiram Howard, chairman. Much.
of the humor will concentrate on
the graduating class and on the
question of ﬁnding places for them
in the breadlines. In addition,-there
willvbe a full page drawing of .a
beauty contest<winner,' ~ "3. “Miss
America,” who will cause unprece-
dented patriotism among the male
readers. ‘ -

The Panther has turned its at-
tention to_clothes, and in the June
issue publishes pictures of the three
best-dressed ‘hen on campus."

The men were chosen by members

“Alice Sit-By-The-Fire” 

Players"’i.Year

Sir James M. Bai-rie’s comedy,
“Alice Sit-by-the-ﬁre,’? was present-
ed by Pitt Players at the Y. M. and
Y. W. H. A. auditorium last eve-
ning. This play,“ which told the
story of the mother who learned -.-‘to
control her children by letting them
thnk that ‘they -were controling her,
madeqa successful ﬁnis for this sea-
son’s work. - A , V

. Sarah. Drum’s portrayal of Alice
Si-t-by-the-Firefwas the high spot of
the evening’s performance. "Her ﬁrst
meeting with her thirteen-year-old
son, Cosmo, was extremely well
played. Every wo‘rd and every ac-
tion was spontaneous. The role of
Cosmo was taken by Anthony Hen-
rici, and was realistic in every de-
tail. ,0ne really-felt sorry for the
poor fellow as he tried to keep his
father from kissing him.

“GINNY” PLAYS AMY

Virginia Wickers-ham,‘in, the role
of Amy, the daughter with the six-
teen-year-old’s usual distorted view
of life, was especiallyagile ‘in pre-
senting her character as one would
imagine Barrie would enjoy .seeing
it presented.

Genevra, Amy’s bosomchum, was
the role assigned to Margaret Cris-
man. The role is an extremely dif-
ﬁcult one because Genevra is a very

strange ideas.- But Miss Crisman
did very well in the part and made
it amusing to watch Genevra a-s she
coped with the situati,_nV_V as‘.sli_e had
‘  ones  ‘W’ 

  
   

queer character, and has some very ‘

   
  
  

The part of the Colonel -was
played by Richa'rd‘Kennedy. He did
his best work in the scene in, which
he discovered’ that his daughter was
hidden‘ in the closet of Stephen Rol-
lo’s living-room. Stephen Rollowas
the part taken by Georgie'Bo‘ggs: it
isn’t easy to act the part of the “ex-
traordinary man,” but Boggs does it
very well. u . .
PERSONALITY GIRL IN PART

Adelaide Hunter did excellent
work as the slayey with the “chop”
complex._ The nurse (Ethel Dan-
forth) was frightening to "say the
least. Why the baby Molly wouldn't
jump to the. arms of the “belle of
Bengal” in preference to the fuzzy-
headed nurse .with a little cap on
the top of her head is more than I
can explain.
fant were contributed by Cynthia
Dean). The part of the Grey’s maid
was taken by Hannah Taim-uty.

So much ofthe enjoyment of a
Barrie comedy depends on hearing
every word of the dialogue, and
when the players talk indistinctly or

~-t‘o"o fast the audience feels cheated.

That is the chief criticism of an
amateur production of a Barrie play,
but Pitt Players had a minimum
amount of this type of annoyance, in
last night's performance.

The stage settings were well-
planned and clesigned. The technical

f"READING THE SUNDAY papers
, lastweek, the writer was particu-
. Iarly impressed by the manner in
‘ywhich the marks made in the Pitt
interscholastic track meet compared
with those made in the Pitt-West
¥-drginia meet held at Morgantown.
:_.-v~:‘~.'5[‘he mark made by Murphy of
‘Butler high in winning the javelin
 throw was three feet better. than
~ that made by Kopnicki in winning
_ the same event at the Morgantown
meet; while Brown of Akron Cen-
-fral jumped ﬁve feet, eleven inches
“to win the scholastic high jump, the
 height reached by Utterback
hd Kirkpatrick of Pitt, who tied
‘ r ﬁrst in the collegiate meet.
 The bettering and the equaling of
the collegiate marks by the school
 ‘stars brings up the old question as
i’ to? hether or not the high school
 s of today place too much

 upon -competition when
 they are not fully developed and are
, *thus~ quickly burned out.

 YOUR WRITER RECALLS a case
11928 when trackmen all over the
country were in rigorous training in
hopes of representing the country in
the ‘Olympic games.
 At that time, there were two
promising high school sprinters on
the-.. Paciﬁc coast, one named Lom-
bardi I» and other, Frank Wykoff.
Loinbardi had been elected captain
5‘f-his .,school’s baseball team; but
his‘ track ability was so outstanding
that his high school principal told
 him that he could best serve his
school by making the Olympic team.
‘f In a meet between the schools of
which Lombardi and Wykoff were
students, Lombardi tied the then rec-
jiognized world record for that dis-
ﬂfance by covering the course in 9.6
{seconds. He was looked upon by

gﬁitics as being a sure bet for the
"___,y\mpic team *tha;c ykear.

IN THE COAST tryouts, however,
,~l?e‘i"‘failed to place, Wykoif and Char-
Iey Paddock ﬁnishing first and sec-
ond, respectively, in the century.
Wykoff had been brought along
I radually and was reaching his peak
:,g,lien the races occurred. Lombardi,
on thegother hand, had been brought
along too fast with the res-ult that
 burned out while only in high
school and nothing has been heard
1;‘): {him in track competition since
that time.

 Wykoﬁ’, nineteen years old at the
-tirne, went on to the national ﬁnal
"tryouts held at the Harvard stadium
3 ndg_won the 100~yprd dash there.
2 S e reached his peak of the year in
 race. ,
 « His youth told upon him, however,
in the races in Amsterdam, and he
could ﬁnish no better than sixth in

the ﬁnals. He had a breakdown
shortly afterward, and after an op-
eration had been performed on him,
he was forced out of competition
for one year. He proved the excep-
tion to the rule, however, when he
came back last’ season to hang up a.
a new mark fo*r the 100-yard dash.
I!

ANOTHER CASE SOMEWHAT
identical to that mentioned above
was that of a young high school lad
named Wai-fuel of Huntingdon, West
Virginia.

In 1929, that lad, only a fresh-
man in high school, came to the Pitt
interscholastics, unheralded, only to
win the 100 and 220-yard dashes.
He tied the record in the former
event when he covered the distance
in 10 seconds ﬂat, while he set up
a new record of 22.2 seconds for
the lon.ger race.

Being only a freshman, great
thin-gs were expected of the lad in
his three remaining years in high
school and in his collegiate career
thereafter. The youth, however,
had had too much competition. He
burned out, and were it not for the-
fact that the records of the record-
holders for the Pitt meet are pub-
lished annually, very few people
would gemembcir his performances.

FURTHER EXAMPLES ALONG
the same line might easily be
pointed out. Pryor, who won both
the 100 and 220-yard dashes in the
1930 school meet when he was only
a freshman, tying the record in the
latter event, won only the 100 this
year. He made the same time in

this event as he did the preceding

year. Hines of Warren, Ohio, win-
ner of the 220-yard dash, made
slower time for that race that Pryor
did. in 1930 when the latter was a
double winner.

Many critics have decried the
present system of competition be-
tween the growing boys who attend
our high schools. Exercis-e such as
they receive in ﬁjlese meets will
prove helpful-to them if taken in
the right proportion; but when
these same lads are drilled to break
records set up by more mature ath-
letes, they are undertaking a propo-
sition for which they are not fully
prepared.

The matter is not one to be passed
over lightly. It is very serious in
its nature, and this writer, at least,
believes that it would be better to
limit the amount of time to be util-
ized by the growing boys in com-
petitive athletics. The University
of Chicago .has discontinued its na-
tional scholastic basketball cham-
pionship for that reason. Pitt and
other institutions which sponsor
school meets should do likewise.

FRAT MUSHBALL
GAMES DELAYED

BY WET FIELDS

Greeks Predict Ungehtlemanly
Handling of Bill Brotzman
Because of Weather

1.

Although Professor Bill Brotzman
prophesied fair and warmer, the
Greek mushballers found themselves
in a peculiar jam when weather con-
ditions forced almost indeﬁnite post-
ponements for the games.

After a meeting of the official
mushball committee last Wednesday
afternoon, that august body, com-
posed of Bob Remaley, Morris Co-
hen and Ben Sufrine, decided to ex-
tend the period allotted to the play-
ing off of the second series of games
until 4:31 o’clock, Wednesday after-
noon, May 20.

At the beginning of the present
week, all of the ﬁrst series had been
completed with the exception of the
game between Theta Chi-Phi Kappa.
They had the singular misfortunes
of having their games called twice,
each time a tie, before they man-
aged to play one through. The Theta
Chis then promptly trounced the
Phi Kaps and entered the second se-
ries.

On Tuesday night, the Theta
Chicrs opened the second series by
defeating their Belletﬁeld pals, the
Sig Alphs, by a score of 6-7. This
was the ﬁrst game of_ the second se-
ries. ~
The Kappa Sigs and the Omega
Delts were scheduled to play Mon-
day night, but postponed their game
until later. Other games that must
be played before Wednesday are
Kappa Nu and Phi Epsilon Pi, and
the History All Stars with Sigma
Chi. ‘

The Sigma Chi boys ulled a sur-
prise over the Theta De ts when they
trounced the Locals 19-1 in a down-
pour. They will have their hands‘
full with the History All Stars, for
that team has shown great strength.
, The winners of the second series
will enter upon the semi-ﬁnals next
Thursday, and the ﬁnal game for
the championship mushball lodge
will probably be held early in the
week of May 17.

Utterbaclz Honored
Al‘ “Y” Dinner

Everett Utterback, the dusky hued
captain of the Pitt track team, was
honored last Wednesday with a din-
ner given him by some of his
friends at the colored Y. M. C. A.

Utterback has been the backbone
of the Pitt track team for three
years. He is the ﬁrst colored ath-
lete to be honored with a captaincy
of a Pitt team. Last week he won
the broad jump at Ohio State. He
has been winning a number of na-
tional ﬁrsts since he started run-
ning.

FROSH SPIKERS
FACE TWO FOES

Meet Kiski and Carnegie Tech
Freshmen At The Stadium
Tomorrow and Tuesday

After a lot of practice and little
competitive activity, the University
of Pittsburgh freshman track team
are faced with a busy week—end. To-
morrow they will meet the Kiski.
track team at the stadium, and on
Tuesday the Carnegie Tech fresh-
men will furnish the opposition
again at the stadium. .

When Pitt meets Kiski, some very
good races should be run. One that
is expected to raise the spectators
out of their seats is the mile, run.
When Kadlic of Kiski an-d Lawrence
of Pitt tangle the winner ‘should not
be decided untilthe last ten yards.
The sprints, as usual, will furnish
a good spectacle, and the weights,
while not as stirring as the running
events, should furnish a number of
thrills.

In the Tech meet, the high jump,
the discus, the hurdles, the mile and
the half-mile should be very close.
Biggin of. Tech and Bodgda, the has-
ketball player, may raise the barrier
very close to six feet before the
winner will be decided. In’ the dis-

'cus, Edelblut of Tech, a basketball '

player, will meet Milligan. This
should furnish some close competi-
tion. Edelblut is also a hurdlesman

and will, in all probability, run al

good race to make the winner be a
good winner: Schell of Tech and
Lawrence of Pitt will meet in both
the mile and the half-mile.

Last Saturday at West Virginia,
the fresh track team was defeated
by thescore of 66-58. A number of
the freshmen showed exceptional
promise.
man of the track team, was the
highest point scorer. He took ﬁrst
in the discus and seconds in the
100 and 220. The timeeof the 100
was very fast for freshman compe-
tition. It was run in ten flat, and
the 220 was run in twenty-one and
one-ﬁfth. Milligan gives promise of
being another Bowen or Utterback.

Keller is another freshman from
whom much is expected when he
reaches varsity competition. Keller
has run the quarter-mile in forty
nine and two-ﬁfths seconds. — The
world’s record is near forty-eight
seconds. Also, Keller has broken

two minutes for the mile which is .

very fast time. If these two men
continue to show the form they have
shown thus far, Pitt, in the near fu-
ture, will have another very good
track team. _

Quay wonthe 120-yardhigh hur-
dles at West Virginia. Quay should
win a number of firsts in the hur-
dles in hiscollegiate career. Last.
year he was the New York State
hurdles champioii. ' 9 '

The freshman track team would in
all probability. have ‘beaten the West
Virginia team if just prior to the
meet ﬁve of the most promising men
on the team were not declared ineli-
gible. '

Mountaineer Spikers
Defeat Panthers

West Virginia track superiority
was once more demonstrated last
Saturday at Morgantown when Pitt’s
varsity and freshman track teams
fell before the Mountaineers by
scores of 911/2-43% and 66-58, re-
spectively. Two West Virginia rec-
ords were broken, and four were
tied on a sl-ow ﬁeld. Pitt freshmen
were more fortunate in the track
events than the varsity, and only
West Virginia’s superiority in some
of the ﬁeld events provided the nar-
row margin of victory.

Utterback once more turned up
as Pitt’s high score man, with 17
points gathered in winning the broad
jump, tying for ﬁrst in the high
jump, winning the pole vault, and
placing sec-ondin the century. Milli-
gan, freshman ace, led the cubs in
scoring with 12 points. Milligan won
the shot put, placed se-con-d in the
century and 220, and third in the
discus. .

Outside of Utterback, Monheim
and Ko'pn.icki were the only Pan-
thers to garner ﬁrst places, Mon-
heim winning the 440, and Kopnicki
taking the javelin. Bogda showed
well forthe frosh in placing in the
high jump and broad jump. Keller
scored victories for the Pitt fresh in
the 440 and 880-yard runs.

NEW CASTLE Hl
TRACK WINNERS

Athletes Set 3 New Records;
Ohio School Tie For Second
Place In Meet

New Castle won the twenty-fourth
annual renewal of the Pitt Inter-
scholastic track and ﬁeld meet, held

here last Saturday.

New Castle scored 12 1-2 points to
snatch the victory from two Ohio
schools, Akron Central and Warren,
which were tiedfor second with 11
points apiece. In fourth place with
10 came Ellwood City.

Peabody, with .nine; Westinghouse,
Steubenville, and Connellsville, with
eight; Beaver Falls, Washington,
and N anty-Glo, with six, and Derry
Township, Butler, and Uniontown
each with ﬁve ﬁnished in the order
named. Eleven other schools were
able to at least score.

NEW FIELD MARKS

Two old marks in the ﬁeld events
were bettered when Curt Young of
Beaver Falls put the shot 46 feet
:5 1-2 inches, and when Johnny Mur-
phy, Butler veteran, hurled the jave-
lin 173 feet to beat the old record of
170 feet, made by Altaﬁer of Kiski
in 1923. _ , ‘

The one new track standard was
set up by UniontoWn’s mile relay
quartet which sped over the required
distance in 3:31.5, lowering the old
time of 3234.4 set two years ago by
Steubenville. .

SDLDIERSTNDTARTANS,

FURNISH DPPDSITIDN,

SATURDAT_l_\ND TUESDAY W ;

Pitt’s track team with its record marred already by two ’

defeats in their only dual meets thus far this season faces the
likelihood of losing its third and fourth meets within the next
few days when they meet Army and Carnegie Tech.

The Army will be met tomorrow at West Point in the sec-
ond meeting between the two schools, the ﬁrst one having taken

place last year in the stadium and
resulting in an easy victory for the
soldiers.

From the form shown by the lat-
ter’ in their two meets this season,
Pitt’s team ridden with ineligibility,
is due to take its third straight set-
back. Army won its opener rather
easily over Bowdoin and came back
last week to Wallop Boston College,
90-36.‘

Army boasts of several perform-
ers who have done much better in
their specialties than have the best
of the Pitt men in the same events.

MOORE SPRINT STAR

Moore, star sprinter for the Ca-
dets, was clocked in ten seconds pat
for the century and in 21.8 seconds
in the furlong last week. Greene,
Malloy, Inskeep and Stecker, the
football and basketball star, are
other «sprinters.

-Hogan, Army quarter miler, has
done 50 seconds ﬂat in that race, one
second better than the time made
by Monheim, Pitt’s best man. Gra-
ham ran theihalf-mile in one min-
ute, 57 seconds last week, whereas
Watkins of Pitt cannot get under
two minutes.

G'raham’s time for the mile is 4:25
while Campbell, a‘~ teammate, has

been clocked in 4:26. These marks
are far better than any time made
by the Pitt men. Allen, 10 minute

two miler, should also have little -

trouble against the Panthers.

‘ Army also holds a big advantage
in theaweight events. Lankernau can
toss the javelin 192 feet. Price and
Messinger, football men, put the
shot over 47 feet. And Hillberg’s
130 feet mark in the discus is bet-
ter than any distance reached b
Luch, Pitt’s best. .
UTTERBACK PITT HOPE

Pitt’s only’hopes for victory lie in
the two jump events and in the pole
vault, in all three of which Utter-
back will be Pitt’s strongest repre-
sentative. Greene of Army does 21
feet, 9 inches in the bro-ad jump,
Moore does 5 feet, 9 inches in the
high jump, and Davis does 12 feet
in the pole vault.

Utterback has bettered the marks
in each of these events, and it is
not unlikely that he will win three
firsts for the Panthers.

‘ Protest In Sweepstakes Decided

In Favor of Delts; D°Cl5l°"
May Be Reversed

Sigma Alpha, Epsilon and Delta

- Tau 'De1.ta were declared winners of

' terf . te ity track meet which
3.1:sn}},e1d rfn lMnay 2. as the conclud-
ing feature’ of Sprmg Festival, at

' 3 meeting of the members of the

, the
to

track meet committee last week.
The -question as to which teams
were entitled to the first and sec-
ond, place cups arose when Theta
Delta Psi protested the action of Art
George, who was in charge of the
ﬁeld events at the meet, in 110?: 9-1‘
lowing Miller, member of that fra-
ternity,,,to compete in the broad

m .

JuMiller» was entered in the 100 and
220—yard dashes, but he did not com--
pete in the latter event. He sub-
 the 440-yard dash for it
upon the‘ permission of the Gene
Pvry, chairman of the meet, who was
in charge of the track events.

QUES_’l'ION ON RULES

Pry interpreted the rules as say-
ing that In man could compete in
any three events. provided that he
was entered by his fraternity In at
least one event _and provided that
his fra,tgrn_ity.d1d not have more
than one other man competing In
the same event. .

George, however,_wou1d not allow
a man to compete In any eve: Im-

hjg ymternity has speci cal-ly

The difference in the in reta-
tion of the rules by the two 0 cials
caused the trouble Miller was per-
mitted to broad jump, but his mark
did not count. He Jumped. over .18
feet, which would have entitled him
to second place in the event and
which would have placed Theta Del-
ta Psi, which he was representing,
in second place above the Delta.

After the protest had been_ made,
the track meet committee decided to
hold the shot put over again In or-
der to allow a Dell; man who was
refused permission to participate in
it by‘ Gerge to compete, the mark
of Miller counting in the broad
J’ump~ .

The Delta Tau Delta man put the
shot further than any other con-
testant, giving his team ﬁve ‘addu-
tional points which entitled it to
ﬁrst place.

SIG ALPHS PROTEST

Sigtmo. Alpha Epsilon which had
been announced originally as the
winners of ,the meet protested the
decision to grant the first place cup
to Delta Tau Delta.

' Following’ this action, the track

-_. meet committee, composed of Pry,

aﬁeorge a.-nd.;,B_oh,.Kleeh,__ met , and de:
éded that the action; of the former
two had been as fair to one frater-
nity as it had been to another and
that the winners of the point tro-
phies as announced directly after the
gieelt had been completed should be
na .
 The protest on the sweepstakes
was also decided with Delta Tau
Delta receiving the first place cup
and Phi Delta Theta receiving the
second lace cup. ‘
f The hi Delts protested the re-
Illt on the contention that Ford
Clark, who helped push ’ the Delts’

pushmobile and is a student in. the“

auedical school, was not an active
member of their chapter, 

'  matter was " referred to .

Spring Festival, and Frank Good-

Will Meet Notre Dame In South
Bend Tomorrow In Third
Match Of Season

After weeks of anxious expec-
tancy, it was announced by the Ath-
letic Council that the Pitt golf team
will meet the Notre Dame golf team
at South Bend tomorrow. _- p ~

The Pitt team lost their ﬁrst
two matches _«of the; season against
Georgetown .UniversIty, and George-
Washington, both of Washington, 
C." In theestwo matches, the_P1tt
team showed a lack of experience
with Captain Parks the only one to
win his two matches. , _ »

Prospects are not very bright’ for
.a victory over Notre Dame,_ because
of the poor quality of the Pitt team.
Captain Parks will have a tough
time on his hands trying to WlIl.hlS
third match as he is pitted‘ 38'?-m_St
Heomans last year's runner.-up_~1n
the intercollegiate championships.
Parks has never met Heomans be-
fore as he was in a different brack-
et than Heomans last. year.

The other three men to compose
the team will probably -include, be-
sides Parks, Wolff, Rosenberg and
Ledermanr” Bruno and Irwin are
making determined bids  be in-
cluded on the team that W’-Ill compete
in South Bend tomorrow with the
ﬁnal selection resting with Parks-

The match with Notre Dameis
the last one on this year’s schedule.
Theother remaining collegiate con-
tests being the championships at
Chicago. Parks will make the trip
for a certainty, but whether any-
body else .accompanies him is not de-
cided as yet. .

with interest include the. outcome of
the hot ﬁght for the ﬁve positions‘

the political — free-for-‘all among the
College candidates where eight can-

Eleven men ‘have’ tossed the pro.-

them in the past decade, and thus
far this season, they have won all
their meets, P. A. A., Western Re-
serve, Cincinnati and Wash-Jeif be-
ing their victims.

Several football men have taken
up the sport seriously this year at
Tech and they have developed into
capable weight performers. _ Armen-

ntrout, captain-elect of the football

team, has already broken the school
hammer throw record. Dreshar and
Karcis have made good showings in‘
the shot and discus, while Stentz,
basketball star, has won the javelin
throw in every Tartan meet to date.

SOPII SENSATION AL

Add to this the sensational form
shown by Tom Coulter,‘ sophomore
sensation in the two hurdle races
and in the 440, and the general con-
clusion drawn is that the Tartans
will be mighty hard to beat. Coul-
ter has been beaten but once this
year and that occurred in the Penn
Relays in whiclrhe finished second
in the 400 meter hurdles,. which -is
classy running to say the least.
George Nease, basketball captain,
has been clocked in ten seconds ﬁat
in the century. He also has good
marks in the 220 and in the 440.
Ramsey has been trottinfg the_ mile
in 4:40, while Price, cross-country
captain, hopes to repeat his victory
over Pitt’s best distance men last
fall again when he encounters them
in the two-mile grind. ‘
With such stars as Pete Bowen,
Gibby Welch, Ken Wibecan, Vic
Pickard and Don Gwinn l-epresent-
ing the Panthers in the past years,
Tech has always proven easy vic-
tims; but from the present outlook,
the Tartans will be favorites to cop
Tuesday’s meet. . .

American Association: of University

women follows the coronation. Sim-
ilarly several other integral parts .
of the week have become crystallized
into tradition—the W. A. A. Buggy
Ride, the Sunset dinner, the Corona-
-tion Tea Dance.

“Since these are literally tak-
en for granted from year to
year, the conflict with the Men’s
plans may seem inevitable. If
there can be no agreement, the
best. recommendation for the
senior week committee would en-
tail its becoming a group whose
purpose is to build up traditions
for senior men.”

The meeting yesterday, however,
cleared up the condition and found
the Senior Week committee pro-
-gressing in its plans for men's and
women’s events. Chairman Lucas
and Co-chairman Munsch have an-
nounced that canes and scarfs wi.l
be out on the campus next week.
The events listed for Senior Week
are colorful and include several new

Out of loss. .   
. . . a gain I

When the great warplacecl an embargo
on imports from‘ the Central Powers,
‘ American industry found itself deprived
of many necessary products. Among them
the standard asbestos sheet packing then
in general use. ' I I . I

A substitute had to be found. Accord-
ingly Crane Co. procured every sheet
packing that could be obtaincd..Using
the old one as a basis of comparison, not
one was found which could equal its ten-
sile strcngth, compressive strength, or
heat resistance.

   
       
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
       
       
   
   
   
   
   
      

So the best American sheet was chosen
and its manufacturer called in. Experi-
ment after experiment was made until a
sheet was produced that not only equalled
but surpassed the imported product. It
was named Granite.

The story of Granite is typical. For 76
years Crane Co. has strivcn unccasingly
to produce and‘ sell only materials of the
highest quality. When progress calls for
cntircly new materials, our engineers are
never satisﬁed until they have made that
product or that substitute surpassingly
ﬁne. When in practicing the branch of
engineering you are now studying, some
piping problem arises, bring it to Crane
Co. You will find just such co-operation.

And if it rains may I bring Fa-

scarfs cost lots of money, ,and
Seniors don't have much. It would
be much nicer to make everybody
excepting Seniors wear scarfs and
canes, then we wouldn't need to
spend any money, and would still

be individual! -

Janice dear: H.
I just saw BOB REMALLEY

‘ over.at the Weekly oﬂice, and be- .

tween jabs on the Underwood he
paused long enough to tell me
that you were going to resume the
old educational grind again next
fall. Bravo, Jan! I suppose you’ll
ﬁnd a lot of things changed
around here; things have a habit
of appearing and .disappearing
overnight, almost like CLAR-'
-ENCE SOBER"S moustache.

One thing that doesn’t seem to

" change, except to get worse is

the social whirl along aboutithis
time of the year. It’s sort of
hard to" believe, but there are six
fraternity and four sorority for-
mals tonight alone! I never re-
alized there were so many coun-

- try clubs this side of the Rockies.

And what a mixup so’ many on
one night has "caused. Try and
get a date now; it can’t be done.

OLIVE COLE, lwho L

understand that JIM -HOLLAND

her at the Glee Club trip last
