AEl1’s charter revoked
after allegations of
hazing come to light

Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

Pitt has revoked Alpha
Epsilon Pi’s charter until January
1998, effective immediately, after
the fraternity was found guilty of
violating the University’s anti-
hazing policy. AEIT is the ﬁfth
Pitt fraternity to face hazing sane-_
tions this school year.

The sanctions are based on
allegations of hazing incidents
that occurred during the fall of
1994 and were brought to the
University’s attention in April of
this year by two former members
of the fraternity, Josh Akeyand
David Stukus. Both Akey and
Stukus declined comment on the
charges.

“Two former members said
that they experienced a lot of
humiliation and various forms of
hazing, that upon reﬂection, they
resented this very much and
made known their complaint,”

‘said Dennis Donham, assistant

vice chancellor for student
affairs.

The ex-brothers lived on the
fraternity ﬂoor in Brackenridge
Hall and went inactive during
spring semester. AEIT expelled
the two ﬁ'om the fraternity later
that semester. According to fra-

temity members, the ex-brothers
sent their allegations in a letter to
Interim Chancellor Nordenberg a
week after being expelled from
the ﬁatemity.

' The recommendations of the
original hearing panel that inves-
tigated the allegations and heard
testimony from both the former
and current members, as well as
AEIT ofﬁcers, were increased by
Donham.

“My reason for increasing the
sanctions of the hearing panel is
that there appears to have been a
comprehensive pattern of degrad-
ing and illegal tasks assigned to
new members during 1994, and
the ﬁaternity appears not to have
been forthcoming about any of
these matters when properly
challenged on them,” Donham
said in a letter announcing the
decision. ‘

Scot Stoner, the president of
the fraternity, denied all the alle-
gations and said that AElT ‘will
appeal the decision to Vice
Chancellor of Student and Public
Affairs Leon Haley. If that appeal
is denied, the national AEH fra-
ternity can petition the University
in January 1998 to recolonize the
fraternity.

“We are appealing, and we
have the national ofﬁce backing

Public hearing about riverboat
gambling highlights sides to debate

Ben Jackson
Editor-in-Chief

Riverboat gambling may soon become a reality
in Pennsylvania.

Right now, the House Judiciary Committee is
holding hearings throughout the state to determine
what action they should take on a bill that would
permit legalized gambling on riverboats. The most
recent of these hearings took place last Wednesday
in the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union Ballroom This hearing
gave some indication of the shape of the debate.

There seem to be three sides in the debate. The
ﬁrst is that of those who want riverboat gambling
to become legal. The second is that of the owners,
operators and the support people of the horse rac-

ing industry. Currently, the only legal gambling in J

Pennsylvania besides the lottery is wagering on
horse racing, either at the track or at ofI”—track bet-
ting sites. The third group is composed of those
who are against gambling on moral grounds.

Much of the testimony at Last Wednesday’s
meeting came from members of the horse racing
industry. On the whole, they were against any
expansion of legalized gambling in the state.

They were, however, willing to compromise, if
there were some legal protection for the horse rac-
ing industry built into the legislation for riverboat
gambling. House Bill number 2308 provides the
legal framework for establishing riverboat garn-
bling in Pennsylvania, and it creates a commission
to oversee these establishments.

Rod Piatt, the chairman of the State Harness
Racing Commission in the Department of
Agriculture, said “If there is going to be expansion
in gaming, we must be certain not to jeopardize
horse racing.”

Piatt went on to explain that horse racing tracks

_ are becoming entertainment spots more than garn-

bling places. He also said that the agricultural
industry would be hurt if horse racing were to suf-
fer. .

Paul Spears, of the Live Horse Racing Council,
said that he was there to represent the interests of
“horsemen,” a group he deﬁned as the breeders,
jockeys, grooms, veterinarians and stable owners.
These are separate from the owners and operators
of racetracks and had different interests. He too
outlined what he saw were the threats of riverboat
gambling to the horseracing industry and to agri-
culture in the state. ' '

He went on to say that while the horsemen as a
group were against the bill, if there was going to be
riverboat gambling, they wanted statutory protec-
tion. The speciﬁc protection they asked for is that a
percentage of casino gaming proﬁts would go into
the purse for horse races. The purse is the prize
money awarded in a horse race. It generally is
divided up percentagewise by the owners of the
ﬁrst ﬁve horses who cross the ﬁnish line.

Spears’ arguments were that an increased purse
would provide more money for the horseracing
industry to. offset any losses that might be incurred

do to riverboat gambling, and it would make the

express their support for AIDS
awareness.

The second annual
Pittsburgh AIDS Walk will
take place Sunday, June 9,
beginning at 9 a.m. on
Flagstaff Hill in Schenley
Park.

The entire day will be devot-
ed to AIDS awareness activi-
ties in the park. Various AIDS
organizations will have infor-
mation stands set up, and there
will also be entertainment
including clowns, jugglers,
mirnes, and face painting. ’

The Walk will kick off with

An estimated 3,500 people
will take part in the five—1nile
walk which will go through the
streets of Oakland, Squirrel

will end back at the park,
where there will be a free con-

Michelle Pagano of the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force
said that last year’s Walk
“made history” in comparison
to comparably—sized cities. The
Walk raised $135,000 with
1,300 participants, and Pagano
hopes that this year’s Walk
will raise up to $300,000.

hope that the truth comes out, we

Stoner said that AEH follows
a national 5-week pledge pro-

4 made the allegations “possibly

out of spite.”

The revocation of AEIl’s
charter has more implications
than simply suspending the fra-
ternity’s activities. When a frater-
nity goes on probation, restric-
tions are placed on the number
and type of activities they may
have. A step higher, suspension
means a total freeze on fraternity
activity. According to Donham,

quality of the races higher
because a greater purse would be
a greater draw for the events.

The corn1nittee' also heard testi-
mony from Peter D. Hart, a poll-
ster who conducted a poll of 800
Pemrsylvanians on their opinions
concerning riverboat gambling.
The poll was conducted by tele-
phone, using a Stratiﬁed, random
probability survey.

“We were extremely careful to
get a cross—section of the public of
Pennsylvania,” Hart told the com-
mittee. ,

When asked if the poll was
sponsored by the gaming indus-
try, he continued that it was. He
was quick to point out, however,
that he informed the sponsoring
organizations that they would
have to “take the data as it lays.”

He also said that the poll was
not a push poll. A push poll is a
poll designed to elicit a speciﬁc
result or discover certain infonna—
tion. The questions in such a poll
would be worded in such a way
that brought out information to
see what the result would be.

Hart’s survey found that
approximately 59 percent of all
adults in Pennsylvania would vote
yes on the question of riverboat
gambling. In addition, 89 percent
thought that the question should

be put to a referendum vote.

Hart felt that the most important
ﬁnding of his survey was that at
the beginning and end of the sur-
vey, the respondents were asked
whether they would vote yes or
no on riverboat gambling. At the
beginning of the survey 59 per-

cent said yes, but at the end 66 —

percent said that they would vote
yes. Despite this, Hart assured the
committee that the poll was not a

push poll.
The members of No Dice and
Pennsylvanians Against

Gambling Expansion (PAGE),
two anti-gaming groups, were on
hand to distribute literature and
speak to the press, but were not
on the agenda to testify before the
committee officially. Michael
Greer of PAGE thought that the
money spent creating legalized
riverboat gambling would be bet-
ter spent on economic develop-
ment. “If our state and other states
would spend the money on
attracting real industry, we’d see
real change,” Greer said.

The bill. itself would allow for
legalized casino gambling on
riverboats throughout the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
It would allow these games to be
played on actual moving river-
boats and also on boats that
would remain docked permanent-
ly with no working motors.

and education or business tips. All
of these beneﬁts are offered to
young people as an alternative to
crime and negligence.

“The more things change is the
more they stay the same,” Patton
said. “If we fail to elfectively deal
with [change].we are doomed for
the future.”

One major goal of the organiza-
tion then and now has been to
involve young people as much as
possible. Youth are allowed to
have paying positions in the pro-
gram and are encouraged to
advance to higher and better pay-
ing positions. For example, Km1is
Haiston, 16 years old, is now head
of the art department for Urban
Youth Action.

Youths of all races, ranging in
age from 10 to 19, are welcome.

They must be current students to
be considered. Applicants are
always being considered.

In keeping with his theme of
similarities between the past and
present, Patton argued that racism
and riots still occur today, despite
the supposed progress of our soci-
ety. He compared riots in the
1960s with those in the 90s; the
main diﬁerences he cited were the

wealth of the country and the .
changes in the populations of pris- »-

ons and cities.

Patton urges youth to recognize
these problems and to deal with
them in order to reach a brighter
future.

“The path is forward; and con-
sidering that the future is only sec-
onds away, it is now. The only
limit to the future is your imagina-
tion,” he said. ’ '

The Pitt News

Playing clice with Piﬂsburgh

Last Wednesday, the Pennsylvania House
Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the merits and
drawbacks of legalizing gambling in Pennsylvania.

Legalized gambling is held out as an economic
panacea which will revitalize the Pittsburgh area. This
promise is being made for many cities and states across
the country.

All that glitters is not gold, however, and it is a
mistake to believe that simply because the gaming indus-
try expands that the economy will be revitalized. What
has worked in other areas cannot be guaranteed to work
in Pennsylvania.

It is likely that Pittsburgh, with -its three rivers
would be the site of most of these riverboat gaming
establishments. Yet, what Pittsburgh needs is not to have
its rivers turned into foundations for ﬂoating casinoes.
Instead there are more practical solutions.

The first is to revitalize Pittsburgh’s waterfront
and to free up its Superfund contamination sites for
industrial use. Under the current Superfund law for han-
dling sites contaminated by industrial pollution, the site
cannot be cleaned up until the ones responsible for the
pollution of the site, are made to clean up the site.

Superfund legislation also sets high standards for
the safety levels of the sites. Thus, it is impossible to
build a factory or parking on a site unless it is clean
enough for a nursey school.

The United Kingdom has had success in rehabili-
tating what they call ‘brownfield sites’ which are similar
to the sites covered under superfund legislation. They
are not made pristine again, but safe enough for people
to work at them.

Due to its industrial past, Pittsburgh has a number
of chemically contaminated sites which stand unused.
Tax breaks could be provided to those corporations will-
ing to undertake the rehabilitation of these sites for their
own use. This would bring businesses and jobs to the
area.

In addition, Pittsburgh should work to promote
itself as a place for corporate headquarters. It already has
a reputation for being a center of several major corpora-
tions, and its airport is the hub for USAir and is a major
staging area for British Airways ﬂights.

Riverboat gambling is not the answer for
Pennsylvania’s economic woes, real or imagined.
Pennsylvania in general and Pittsburgh specifically suf-
fered when the steel mills closed en masse in the early
1980s. Industry is no longer the base for the economy.
As one of many post—industrial cities, Pittsburgh must
struggle to find a niche for itself in a new economic
environment.

Balancing the United

important and integral issue in
the upcoming presidential elec-

fundamental restructuring of
the government that the U.S.
work force has been trying for
years to accept and understand.
Regardless, American workers

idea of straightening out their
country’s financial dilemma,
but they are eager to see such a
resolution reached.

The overwhelming
financial burden of this coun-
try’s deﬁcit (currently at $4 tril-
lion) is not only crippling to the
current work force,.but it is
also beginning to have pro-
found effects on the following
generation of young American
workers. Despite the fact that
one would think this ﬁnancial
concern would be a signiﬁcant
motivational factor for the gov-
ernment to take the necessary
steps to alleviate the U.S. debt,
there is always an internal
deadlock. This seems to be
where the primary problem
lies. The national debt will be
both compounded and signiﬁ-
cantly worsened if no thought-
ful and beneﬁcial measures are
taken.

The way in which the
GOP’s Contract wiﬂi America
proposes to reduce the national

deficit may end up hurting
U.S. workers instead of help-
ing them. Downsizing or elimi-
nating fundamental American
social programs is not the

answer to balancing the budget ..

— there are far too many nega-
tive consequences. '
I n c r e d i b l y ,
Republicans plan to contrast
their proposed extreme cuts by
increasing defense spending.
Instead of aiding low—income
workers by directing funds to
social programs, Republicans
want to further military expen-
ditures to ridiculous amounts
— despite the fact that the
Cold War threat no longer
exists. And as the military
expands, the Republicans plan
to invoke cuts in numerous
beneficial programs which
would aid low—income
American families and their
children, such as the Head Start
program and Food Stamps.

The Republican plans
for a balanced budget entails
skewed priorities that will
clearly affect the working
majority. For instance,
Republicans plan to incorpo-
rate excessive cuts in Medicare
and Medicaid which may
mean rural hospitals will have
to close, creating unemploy-
ment in the health-related pro-
fessions. Also, seniors will be
billed for the charges that were
above and beyond their.
Medicare payment, resulting in
tremendous out-of-pocket
expenses.

U.S. workers can’t
afford this direct burden placed
on them to cover the hospital
bills invoked by their ailing
senior family members.
Furthermore, the Medicaid cut
may jeopardize the guarantee
of coverage to low-income
children and nursing home res-
idents.

Again, workers will
suffer even greater ﬁnancial

burdens.

The Republican
Congress has also placed edu-
cation under attack. The GOP
has proposed to cut or even
eliminate the Direct Student
Loan program, which will
affect working families that
have plarmed to send their chil-
dren to an affordable college. It
is difﬁcult for the U.S. govem—
ment to compete with the fast-
rising costs of higher educa-
tion, yet student funding can
and should be kept at adequate
levels to maintain a complete
and substantial education for
America’s future work force.

Even worse, students
who intend to enter the work
force in the near future will
find themselves faced with a
significant debt incurred by
these proposed cuts in educa-
tional spending. It will be next
to impossible for the future of
America to pay for their previ-
ous schooling and at the same

time cope with the pressures of '

higher living expenses. .

The question of how
workers are supposed to com-
pensate for all of the
Republican cuts is not
addressed by the GOP’s plans
for a balanced budget. It is
assumed that workers will sirn—
ply be forced to devote a
greater portion of their pay-
checks to make upfor the
GOP’s underdeveloped and
unbalanced budget plan.

What U.S. workers
need is a Congress that does
not cater to speciﬁc interests on
the right. We cannot continue
to spend money that we have
to take from our future.

Without stronger lead-
ership and true cooperation
from the Republican Congress,
the American work force may
be in debt forever. ,

There are three reasons

Since I arrived on the

The final straw snapped
last Saturday night, a hor-

with the winning goal
coming on a 65-foot

Smith takes second in triple jump at NCAA’s

Shawn Spragg
For The Pitt News

The NCAA held its
Outdoor Track and Field
Championships at the
University of Oregon this
past weekend with three
Lady Panthers trying to
prove that not every Pitt
athlete chokes on a furball
when the pressure is on.

Najuma Fletcher, Angie
Martin, and Trecia Smith
attended the meet with their
coach, Steve Lewis. All
three returning All-
Americans were coming
into the meet with good
momentum after taking
third place in the ECAC
Championships two week-
ends ago.

Fletcher, who has just
been named Big
East/Gillette Female
Scholar—Athlete of the Year
and is in the top five female
track stars in the country,
took 17th place in the triple
jump on Friday with a jump
of 40-9 3/4.

With Fletcher’s hamstring
still bothering her, Lewis
pulled her from Saturday’s
high jump competition.

Fletcher had previously
won the high jump at the
NCAA Indoor Track and
Field Championships last
February in Syracuse, N.Y.
with a Big East record—set—
ting jump of six feet.
Fletcher is a 13—time All-
American and her total of
17 individual Big East
championships is higher
than that of any other ath-
lete in the history of the
conference.

Trecia Smith took second
place in the triple jump as
she continued to make a
name for herself with the
Lady Panthers. For those
out there who do not know
how big this accomplish-
ment is, this performance
earned her the rank of the
second best triple jumper in
the country!

“A new star has been born
on this team,” Lewis said of
Smith. v

Smith was coming off a
win in the triple jump and
the heptathalon at ‘the
ECAC championships. Her
jump of 44-6 3/4 fell only
three inches shy of Pitt’s
all-time outdoor record,
held by Fletcher.

Taking All-American hon-
ors with that jump and her
6.30m sixth-place finish in
the.long jump would have
been amazing enough for
anyone, let alone for a
freshman who has also
made dean’s list twice this
past year.

Smith also rounded out
the three events in which
she was competing with an
11th place finish in the hep-
tathalon.

“You’re not just talking
about a few people here,”
said Lewis about Smith
making the NCAAS her
freshman year. “This is
hundreds and thousands of
athletes across the country.
You have to be in the top 18
just to get into the meet. We
expect big things out of
Trecia in the next few
years.”

Grove gives expert analysis of NBA Finals

Matt Grove
Asst. Sports Editor

The road to the NBA Championship
began back in October when 29 teams
set out to dethrone the two-time defend-
ing champion Houston Rockets. Twenty-
seven of those teams have fallen, and
the basketball world is left to watch the
Chicago Bulls face the Seattle
Supersonics starting tonight at the
United Center in Chicago.

Seattle’s trip to the finals is the team’s
first since 1979 when they defeated the
Washington Bullets. Chicago last made
it to the finals in 1993 as they beat
Phoenix in six games to win their third
consecutive title.

The Bulls won an NBA-record 72
games this season and have cruised in
the playoffs going 11-1, with the only
loss in Game 3 of the conference semifi-
nals to the New York Knicks. Michael
Jordan and Co. went on to sweep Shaq
and the Orlando Magic in the conference
finals, the same team that eliminated the
Bulls a year ago.

Seattle almost bowed out of the play-
offs for the third straight year as the
Sacramento Kings pushed the Sonics to

a fifth game in the first round. Seattle
responded by sweeping the Rockets and
went on to face Karl Malone and the
Utah Jazz.

The Sonics led-the series 3-1 before
Utah rallied with back-to-back wins,
including one in overtime, to force a
seventh game. Shawn Kemp hit four free
throws in the final 77 seconds to seal a
90-86 win and a date with the Bulls.

The two teams split their season series
one game each. Seattle knocked off the
Bulls early in the year in a game in
which Dennis Rodman did not play due
to a calf injury. The Bulls then trounced
the Sonics by 26 at the United Center,
led by Michael Jordan’s 35 points.

Seattle’s Gary Payton, known to many
around the league as “The Glove”
because of his superior defense, shut
down Utah’s John Stockton and held
him to under 10 points and 10 assists per

contest. In exchange for his excellent.

performance in the Western Conference
Finals, Payton has drawn Jordan as his
next task. Payton will likely get help
from Hersey Hawkins and Nate
McMillan.

The Bulls also face a matchup prob-
lem when it comes to Shawn Kemp.

Enter the lovely Dennis Rodman. The
tattooed wonder will get help from
Scottie Pippen and 7-foot-1 Luc
Longley

The Bulls have had 10 days of rest
since disposing of the Magic, compared
to Seattle’s three since winning Game 7
against Utah. Vegas has the Bulls at 9-1
odds. If you’ve got some cash lying
around, this could be the easiest bet
ever. Bulls, 4-1.

of Colorado. The ski resort
had been closed for the
summer, and I was there to
keep things in running
order.

The scene spooked me,
and I was alone to think
about all the lost opportuni-
ties that my teams could
not cash. Mental torture can

_ be devastating.

Eventually, what I
believed to be hallucina-
tions (remember this is
mental torture; magic
mushrooms aren’t abundant
in abandoned resorts)
changed my casual, easy-
going demeanor into one of
a psychotic maniac, one
who craved killing all those
Pittsburgh athletes who
have treated me like a pros-
titute over the last four
years. ,

First, I could see twins.
They stood at the end of the
hall, laughing. They looked
strikingly familiar. The
resemblance to former
Dallas Cowboys cornerback
Larry Brown and San Diego
Charger Tony Martin was
eerie. The two of them
stood there holding the sev-
ered heads of former
Steelers Neil O’Donnell
and Tim McKyer.

The ghosts of Steelers
past have haunted fans
recently. Let’s look at the

' last four years.

' Myfreshman year, new
head coach Bill Cowher
arrived and rejuvenated the
team, leading them to an
11-5 record and home field
advantage throughout the
playoffs. This happiness
did not last long; the
Steelers got trounced by the
Buffalo Bills.

Sophomore year, the
team struggled offensively,
but made the playoffs with
a 9-7 record. It was off to
Kansas City to challenge
playoff—hardene'd Joe
Montana and the Chiefs.
Mark Royals got a punt
blocked; Pittsburgh lost the
lead and the game.

Junior year, Pittsburgh
looked awesome and earned
home field advantage
again. The Chargers came
to town and you needed to
ask McKyer what hap-
pened.

Last year, the Steelers
made the Super Bowl and
outplay the Cowboys on
both sides of the ball. The
only problem was that
O’Donnell found Brown
wide open one time too
many.

The blood gates (actually
an elevator) had opened.
Surely, my mind was lost,
hoping for some satisfac-
tion.

Then it happened. I
walked into the bathroom
and saw a beautiful woman
bathing. She invited me to
join her and we instantly
hit it off. Much to my dis-
may, this beautiful woman

morphed into Panthers’
goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
Relying on instinct, I
quickly grabbed the mag-
num sitting near the sink
(remember this is a dream).
I fired all six rounds at the
Beezer, but he stopped
them all with his blockers.
This wasn’t the first time
in the past four years the
Pens have fallen victim to
superior goaltending.
Remember that 1992-93
team that captured the

.President’s Trophy in con-

vincing fashion? They lost
game 7 to Glenn Healy and
the New York Islanders. Of
all teams, why them? Is it
some strange whammy or
voodoo curse?

Fleeing the scene once

again, I knew I would snap.
It was just inevitable.
While roaming the hall-
ways, former Pirate pitcher
Stan Belinda appeared,
swinging a baseball bat.

Stan’s a marked man in
Pittsburgh after allowing
the infamous ninth—inning
single to one-hit wonder
Francisco Cabrera in the
1992 NLCS. That base hit
scored Sid Bream and gave
the Atlanta Braves a 3-2
win in game 7, ending three
years of Pirate playoff
choking.

Desiring revenge, I cun-
ningly submarined Stan
with a sneak attack that
simply shocked the sissy,
so much so that he began
swinging his stick at me.

With the determination
of Jeffrey Dahmer stalking
unsuspecting prey, I chased
Stan up the stairs in the
main lobby of the resort.

Stan, in hysterics, kept
swinging the bat at me.

“Give me the bat, Stan.

Stan refused.

“Give me the bat, Stan.
I’m not gonna hurt you. I’m
just gonna bash your

Stan gave me the bat,
right on top of the noggin,
and sent me flying down

No one rocks like Dayton’s Guided By Voices.

In the tradition of Pere Ubu, the Dead
_Boys, and Devo, Guided by Voices are
one hell of a rock ‘n’ roll band. Yes, Ohio
was/is the underrated epicenter of rock,
and Dayton’s own GBV are proof. By

now their story is old hat, recycled and
retold everywhere from Spin, Rolling
Stone, MTV, and countless fanzines. The
bottom line is that Robert Pollard, then 4th
grade school teacher, and friends recorded

brilliant albums on home recording equip-
ment. The albums sounded fuzzy, dirty,
and sludgy, and that’s just how the band
liked it. They released a handful of these
records on really small labels and humbly
led their working class lives.

Eventually, nine or ten years into their
careers, Guided by Voices were getting
heard by more people and instantaneously
were becoming a phenomenon. With
“The Grand Hour” ep and Vampire on
Titus lp both on Scat Records in
Cleveland, the band had become the Big
Buzz in the indie world. Everyone was
talking about the group. The band started
to play outside of Ohio on weekends (they
still had day jobs), and luckily came to
Pittsburgh at the CMU Graduate Coffee
House. This was right after the release of
Vampire and the band seemed a bit sur-
prised at their newfound popularity. Lead
singer Robert Pollard told me that he
couldn’t believe it, Thurston and Kim of
Sonic Youth had sent him a Christmas
card! GBV spread across the globe like
wildﬁre and won over the hearts of count-
less music fans. Basically, the 30+ rockers
were just playing music because they
loved it; they combined ‘60s British inva-
sion sounds, early Modern Lovers, early
REM, and a myriad of post-punk outﬁts
into their own thing. Although most of the
songs were under three minutes, the inten-
sity and sincerity of the music was unde-
niable. GBV was and still is about music
for the fun of it. It’s no wonder they
achieved ‘instant’ stardom and respect
from fans and industry alike.

Their success story continued when

Matador Records, indie giant, signed the _

  Guided By Voics finally return to Pittsburgh

band on and released a killer record (co-
released with Scat), entitled Bee
Thousand. Also around this time, The
Breeders turned an early GBV single,
“Shocker In Gloomtown” into an MTV
hit. GBV made a video themselves and
were actually able to quit their day jobs.
Alien Lanes and some singles followed
next and the group proved that they hadn’t
lost their edge nor their penchant for writ-
ing amazing catchy rock songs.

The group’s third Matador release,
Under the Bushes, Under the Stars is
right at home with the band’s other great
releases. This time around the songs are a
bit longer and the album was produced in
a big studio by Breeder Kim Deal. If it
doesn’t hit you like a ton of bricks imme-
diately, then it will certainly grow on you.
I can’t stop singing the refrain from
“Acoms and Orioles” and “The official
Ironmen Rally Song.” This is certainly
one of GBV’s strongest efforts and a must
buy for fans of rock music.

Luckily, the group is coming to town
for the first time in three plus years this
Thursday at Graffiti. The group’s live
shows are nothing less than stunning.
Pollard drinks a cooler of beer in about an
hour and jumps around doing crazy leg
kicks, while there’s plenty of
posturing/windmilling from guitarist
Mitch Michel. All and all, they kick ass.
Opening the 8 p.m. all ages show is
Edison and local pop superstars Vehicle
Flips, the latter having just released an
amazing 7” single that you should own.
See this show.’

Flesh sells,

Joan of Hollywood
written and directed by Edward Evans
produced by The Acting Company

Hailing from the heated south
of Georgia, playwright Ed Evans
has created a perverse story on
media morality. “Joan of
Hollywood” is an off—colored
comedy about a beautiful young
starlet who is inﬂuenced by the
low morals of the movie industry.
The show marks the end of The
Acting Company’s 95-96 season.
The Company was founded by
Glen Gress and Evans 11 years
ago, and their theatre occupies a
renovated old church in
Lawrenceville. Producing under-
ground material with controversial
themes is their forte.

Chatting with Evans about his
scripts, I learned that he has a fas-
cination with the darker side of

» theatre and has grown accustomed

to examining the selling of ﬂesh
thematically within his plays.
“The churches have abandoned
morality ethics.” said Evans. “We
don’t teach it in the schools and
the only way the poor kids get
morality anymore is through
Hollywood.”

Hollywood’s movie market has
not been popular for its whole-
some ethics. “In the play we get
all visions of modern day soci-
ety’s concept of Hollywood and
what’s left of ethics.” Playing up
the ol’ Southern tradition of shel-
tering children (especially the
girls) from profanity allows Evans
to gain this perspective. Evans has
ﬁlled his script with betrayal, sex,

the church is impotent

is

jealousy, greed and gluttony, mak-
ing a bawdy stab at media mes-
sages.

“It’s a look at modern day soci-
ety and how it’s perverted love
into 1ust.” said Evans. Claiming
that media carmot distinguish the
barriers of sex and ethics, “Joan of
Hollywood” depicts a young
innocent girl who is conupted by
the seduction of movie making.
Olfensive language and situations
are the tools Evans uses to capture
his audience. Nudity and raw
material are central to this produc-
tion. Evans believes that people
are more offended by language
when they see it on the stage than
when they read it in a book.
Hollywood has produced an

image of nudity that has changed .

the social attitudes of sex. Evans
said that he was blown away by

Ed Evans’ pay”.|oan of Hollywood” comes to Lawrenceville.

how much profanity New York
kids knew in the late ‘40s, and that
modern media is a cesspool. In his
production the character Joan is
submitted to the effects of this
cesspool with sardonic humor.
The title and theme of the show
allude to the Catholic martyr Joan
of Are. “We get cross signals from
the media and church.” said
Evans, who professes that he
wants to set the stpry straight
before the season ends. “My plays
are emotionally dark and I’m hit-
ting the gray areas with this one.”

The curtain goes up for this
Rabelaisian comedy June 7 and

Fishbone
_ Chim Chim is Badass Revenge
Rowdy Records

Fishbone’s newest release in three years
represents change for the band in many
ways. After eight years at Columbia
Records, the band recently signed with the
smaller Rowdy Records. Chim Chim’s
Badass Revenge is a statement against the
corporate background in which the band
found itself entrapped. -

Chim Chimis Badass Revenge is a return
to the roots of Fishbone and their self-
described “nutmeg” music — a. blend of
funk, ska and hardcore. The band has been
trimmed down to five core members,

though Angelo Moore remains the front-

, man. The album harkens back to their earli-

er, harder days of albums like Truth and
Soul and The Reality of My Surmundings.

The main narrative of this album is
aimed at the commercial nature of the
music «industry and the band’s own prob-
lems at Columbia, where their creative
inﬂuence was held in check. The album
opens with the spoken—word track ,‘ tro”
which seems to start out as a random inco-
herent passage, but evolves into the core of
the album and a revolt against corporate
mass production and the inﬂuence of com-
mercial radio. The band members of
Fishbone have described their “nutmeg”
music as a way to move away from the
radio mainstream, where music is force-fed
down the consumer’s throat, much the way
real nutmeg was used in the ﬁlm Malcolm
X to overcome cocaine use.

Chim Chimis Badass Revenge explores
the nature of this corporate consumerism.
“In the Cube”.is a rocking ska-based tune
about Fishbone’s time at Columbia.
“Everybody’s greedy and they just! Won’t
calm down/Their intentions are good/But
they always get drowned by the ego over-
thrown”: these lyrics portray a system
where money stiﬂes creativity. Basically,
Fishbone compares the record industry to a
toilet from which they had to climb their
way out.

The fast—paced song “Rock Star” contin-
ues  message with deep and powerful
lyrics: “VV1th my black brothas playin’ rock
& roll signed and ho’in for a major label
selling my soul as a rock star.”

While the album deﬁnitely contains a
message reﬂected in almost every song, the
music of Chim Chimis Badass Revenge is a

Revolution
{from page 8

This sale is not only bad news
for fans of the Revolution, but
also for every radio listener in
town. Secret Communications
now owns four FM stations on
the Pittsburgh dial. This is the
classic deﬁnition of a monop-
oly.

If the Clinton-endorsed
telecommunications bill had not

been passed, none of this would ,

have been possible. Before the
bill, one company could not
own four stations on AM and
FM combined, much less on
one dial. Now a company can
own as many as eight total sta-
tions, as long as no more than
ﬁve are on either AM or FM.

Secret is compiling a media
empire here in Pittsburgh.
Where will they stop? Let’s see,
with the purchase, they now
own what were the top three
FM stations. Could AM giant
KDKA be the next station on
their list? Maybe they could get
the top four AM stations in
Pittsburgh as well.

Hell, why stop at radio? I’m
sure for the right amount the
Post-Gazette and the Tribune
Review could be bought. Or
maybe even go for the televi-
sion stations in Pittsburgh. Sure,
just control all of the informa-
tion that we receive on a daily

basis. That’s basically what is
happening with this new empire
on the FM dial.

You may laugh, but this is
serious. Castellini spoke of a
company that basically owns all
of Cincinnati’s media outlets.
They own seven radio stations,
a daily newspaper, and a televi-
sion station. At the time, she
was still unsure about her
prospects of a job, so she
wouldn’t go on record with the
name of this company, but
those of you from Cincinnati
probably know it.

“This company controls
every bit of information that
these people receive. It’s almost
a big brother scenario,” said
Castellini.

If you don’t want this to hap-
pen in Pittsburgh, let Secret
know. Calling and sending let-
ters might help, but the best
way to stop Secret is by not tun-
ing in. There are at least two
other stations in Pittsburgh
playing alternative music and
plenty that play rock. In fact,
one of the best is right here --
WPTS. Time in to them instead.

Just remember, if you switch
to the X like Secret is hoping,
you may not only be tuning in,
you may ultimately be helping
to tune the rest of us out.

great introduction to what Fishbone is all ‘

about. Their hardcore nature is inﬂuenced
with funk—driven horns and beats. Almost
every track is a solid eifort. “Beergut” is a
hardcore hom—based mosh—pit jam reminis-
cent of “Swim” from their previous album,
while “Psychologically Overcast” (which
also features Busta Rhymes) is a more gui-
tar-driven, funk-oriented time. “Alcoholic”
comes back to the ska-based feel of Reality
and songs like “Everyday Sunshine.”

Chim Chimis Badass Revenge covers all
the bases of Fishbone’s past and has them

focusing on the future. At their smaller .

label, Fishbone has more ﬁeedom to create
the music that they have always wanted to
create. While this album doesn’t break
much new musical ground, it is a solid
elfort and a giant step in the evolution of the
band - michael ﬁiedman
