Plans for the Ohio State game
next Saturday took a forward
leap this week when Student Con-
gress obtained Panther’ Hollow for
a pep rally designed to rock the
Oakland district back into the
hectic days of 1939.

The Hollow will resound with
thousands of cheering voices
about 10 p. m. on Friday, October
24, the night before the State
game. The Civic Center will reﬂect
a red tint from the massive bon-
ﬁre that already is being scraped
together.

The band, cheerleaders, the
Panther and notables in the sport
world at Pitt are on the tentative
roster for the.all—schoo1. Further
plans will be announced in next
week‘s News.

Graduate and undergraduate
students who expect to receive
degrees in January, 1948, are
asked to ﬁle applications for

“We’ve got to‘ decide on
some sort of remunerative sys-
tem for the various athletic
teams, or get out of the big
league,” the student veteran
emphasized. W

Franklin Blacksttone, presi-
dent of Interfraternity Council
and another junior representa-
tive to the Congress, expressed
doubt as to the potency of

Congress to obtain anything in‘

the way of satisfactory expla-
nation from. ‘the department.

Blackstone, who has served two
seasons as cheerleader, remark-
ed, “No one has ever obtained in-
formation concerning Pitt’s ath-
letic policy, and “I doubt that
any one ever will.”'

Now or Never

Dickey returned Blackstone's
statement with a “now or never"
motion setting up a committee to
carry out the investigation. The
motion was carried by a unani-
mous vote.

George Lynn, Congress presi-
dent, asked for volunteers for the
committee. Almost complete re-
sponse from the twelve members
present produced the following in-
vestigate group: Dickey and Black-
stone; Charles Davis, president of
l_V.[en’s Council; Janet Neesham,
vice-president of Congress; Abby
Clark, women’s junior representa-
tive; and President Lynn.

Under ‘present plans, the Uni-
versity is considering inclusion of
the student body in the University
Committee on Athletics headed by
Dr. Richard E. Sherrill, professor
of geology.

Meeting Postponed

A meeting was proposed early
in the August between Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald and repre-
sentatives of the student governing
groups to discuss the subject. The
meeting was postponed until the
ﬁrst of. November.

President Lynn made on state-
ment as to the time the new probe
committee would go into action
although it is believed he will wait
on the outcome of the November
meeting.

Pay Elms Play

Subsidization for, athletics has had a bad

‘name at Pitt since the resignation of Jock

Sutherland nine years ago. Since that time,

‘Pitt has attempted to follow a moderate sys-’

tem of athletic scholarships. This is, in part,
subsidization. But it falls short of the intri-
cate systems developed in the “pure” schools
of the m.id—Western Conference.

J The following is a story, as it was related

to us, player from Youngstown, Ohio. He was i
“all-state end and a good student besides. Al-
though we have no proof as to the authenticity 1}

of details, the
Big Ten.

The young man was approached prior to
his graduation from high school, by the coach
of one of the Conference teams} He was given

story typiﬁes football in the

- a full explanation of why he should play for
that team. He was told. that he would have tui-_
tion, books, and lodgingprovided by the school ,

on the athletic scholarship. He would have $40
per month spending money for working Satur-

day mornings running an elevator. His chore .
* was to ‘take the elevator’ up once and down,

once. The money was not provided by _the
school. It was providedby a man interested in
the football future of his alma mater.

The boy‘ returned from the service minus
the use of. his right knee. He was unable to

_play football. Nevertheless, the coach ‘of the j
football school made another trip to Youngs-

town, oﬁered the boy his scholarship, and
oﬁered the $40 per month for the same amount
of work, with the reservation that the boy

would serve the team as football manager.
The story tells more than all black names

against subsidization could‘ ever tell.

- Le’s dance! , ' J

Tonight ’s the night of the ﬁrst open social
event of the school year. For some rather vague
and unexplained reason the social side of Pitt
life has been conspicuous by its absence so far
this semester. But with the Harvest Moon Ball
tonight, an event open to the whole school,

‘things get" moving.

Sponsored by the sophomore class, the dance

promises to give all who attend a real evening’s P

entertainment: Brad Hunt’s orchestra, inter-

..mission specialty numbers, decorations in keep-

ing with the harvest moon season, lots of danc-
ing space in the main ballroom of the William

’ Penn Hotel, and a chance to mingle andhave

fun with your fellow students. The charge is
nominal when compared with values received.

A good attendance at tonight’s dance will

‘auger well for the future. If the students dem-

onstrate that they want and will support dances
and other social events, [ways and means will
be found to have them. ’

So, what d’ya say, —- — Le’s dance!

Earl Bunting, _. president of the National Association of"

day. said ‘,‘We need men and
women with a rounded out know1- .
edge, outside of their academic
ﬁelds. These. are the people who
we first consider for advancement

“Actually. this means the social

In answer, to a query concern-

try, Bunting beamed, “The record

They are more stable, have a
lower absentee and turnover rate
than their male counterparts.” The
average manufacturer has no in-

ment, either. They are more cap-
able at learning things in a hurry.
The NAM president, declared,‘
however, that all of his state-
ments concerning the fairer sex,
are modiﬁed by the marriage fac-
tor. In his own enterprise, Bunt-
ing states, “We’ve set up a sys-
tem of ‘time out for babies,’ The
maternity leave of absence has
worked satisfactorily for us.”
The policies of _the draft boards
and the selective service proced-
ure in general received hard criti-
cism from the manufacturer when
he spoke of theshortage of train-

“We are paying the penalty now,
"and will for years to come, for
removing all of our technical stu-
dents from the campuses of the

Bunting, in answer to a ques-
tion concerning the inevitable de-
pression, presented the plan for-
mulated by the NAM shortly af-
ter the close of the war.

Next time you’re' in the Cathedral post office, try asking George

Chances are you’ll be greeted by an armful of mis-cellanea rang-

and again something turns up to
vary the routine -—— something in-

ings and discarded fraternity pins.

It’s these articles that are hard-
est to return, Mr. Kapps explains.
Ordinary dull jobs such as text-
books and overcoats are usually
marked with owner’s name and

postcard produces a b relieved
claimant in short order- If no
claim is made on a book after one

“Certainly would be a shame to
see those sheer black silk stock-
ings go to the Salvation Army.”

While the band was waiting for

swarmed around it and shouted
requests: for more Pitt music. One

of the ardent admirers was a for-

who is now an official of the Gen-

book will come the money for a
library, radio, and card tables to
supplement facilities.

High ‘on the list of future pro-
jects is the “Feuding Frolic.” This
dance, sponsored by thecabinet,
will be held on Nov. 28, the eve-

Once again the Community
Chest, which represents 92 dif-
ferent charitable organization is
beginning its yearly drive.

This year the goal is larger than
ever for the Pittsburgh area:
some $4,947,023. Of this total

7 Pitt’s share will be $15,400.

Slated to begin on Nov. 5 and

.end Nov. 6, the Pitt drive will

encompass students and faculty

from the immediate campus and

from the various schools of the
University.

Mellon Institute will conduct a
separate campaign this year.

The goal has been upped 3-0
per cent this year because the
Community Fund has indicated
that the increase will be neces-
sary to meet rising costs in the

support of the 92 agencies.

9 Tomorrow morning, the most
successful Panther country squad
will defend their Schenley Park
course against Penn State’s har-
riers. p

The Lion puddle-jumpers, led
by Gerry Karver and Horace
Ashenfelter, have been installed
as heavy favorites to repeat last
year’s triumph. In their first ef-
fort, the Nittanymen trounced
NYU, 18-37.
’ The Olsonmen have two wins
and no defeats to their credit this
far. The thinclads have already
taken over the Case and Slippery
Rock teams. Carl Olson has ten
lettermen back from 1946 as the
nucleus for his squad.

‘Panthers Aim for First Win

Over Big Nine Foe Since 1938

An injured animal is dangerous. The crippled Panther, angered
by three successive beatings, will be ﬂailing ferociously, and may
fracture the embarrassing string of victories Big Nine elevens
have put together at Pitt’s expense.

Since 1938, when Dr. John B. (Jock) Sutherland’s Cats tripped_

the Badgers of Wisconsin, 26-6, the Panthers have battled fruitlesbr

with the Mid-Western conference opponents. Tomorrow, they try ‘

again in meeting Bo McMillan’s

Indians at Bloomington.

Although Pitt is eager to win Saturday, Mike Milligan will

have a physically—weak squad¢

with which to face this task.
Tackle Moe Harris left the team

and Pitt this week to accept a job.

offered him. With Wib Forsythe
not fully recovered, the tackle po-
sition is far undermanned:

Barkouskie Ready
Trainer Howard Waite promises
Guard Bernie Barkouskie for the
Indiana game. but Bernie will see
strictly limited service. The bad
charleyhorse Quarterback Bill

Bruno suffered two weeks ago

will keep him on the sidelines
Saturday.

Walt Cummings will be ‘ready.
George Matich and Elmer K02-
zora will play, but with slight in-
juries. The remainder of the team,
not many,_are in good shape for
the Hoosier fray.

Milligan has worked with the
gridders this week perfecting de-
fenses against , the Indiana single
wing and the wing-T. Pass de-
fense, a fault common to both
teams, was practiced all Week.
But, offense was keynoted by the
win-hungry Panthers.

How About Richards

The Pitt garne—train left Penn-
sylvania Station last night at
10:25 p.m. The traveling squad
will bus from Indianapolis to
Bloornington and move into the
Clay Pool Hotel.

Team spirit must be high for
the game. Even Paul “Low Gear”
Rickards worked hard at prac-
tice. Maybe his aerial ability will
provide the impetus for victory
over pass-defenseless Indiana.

Spectators at the last three In-

shadowy ﬁgure of Bob. Timmons
scurrying about. Weekdays, Bob-

1by is the Pitt line coach but Sat-

urdays _he scouts the opposition.

His familiarity with the Hoosiers.

qualiﬁes him as an expert.

Timmons thinks that the
Hoosiers are a much better team

than they’ve showed themselves

to be this far. “Man for man, In-
diana is far better than Pittﬁ’ he
said. “They’re a mature ball club

and a better than average one.

However, they’ve got no ﬁre and
that accounts for their record.”

Don’t Play Inspired Ball

Sifting through his notes he
went on, “The Indiana boys are
older and more worldly than most
teams even today. Usually, when

I a boy has been around, its» a lot

harder to get him steamed up
over a game than a. younger fel-
low.” —

Indiana rooters have been kept

in an uproar by the brilliant ﬁeld _

antics of_George Taliaferro. The
big colored boy from Gary, In-
diana can " do everything that a
back should do. Besides totaling
up as much yardage as anyone in
the conference, he can pass’ and
does the punting.

When asked about Taliaferro,
a peculiar acquisitive gleam, pe-
culiar to coachescame into Tim-
mon’s eye. “Taliafe‘rro is easily.»
the best player on the Indiana
t am. The entire Indiana game is
built about him.” Timmons then
added, “As Taliaferro goes, so

.. goes Indiana.”

Brown Best Lineman

Asked whether any Wabash
lineman impressed, him, he re-’
plied, “I’d like to have their guard
and captain, Howard Brown on
my team. ‘That boy is ﬁve ‘foot

Rumors Still Flying
Over Michigan Tiff

By Myron Kopelman ‘ I
With the Indiana game only a day away, the Cathedral’s halls
were still buzzing today over reports that dissension had pervaded
the Panther ranks, and that perhaps the players had “laid down”
against Michigan. ‘ .
Trouble was ﬁrst reported, by a local sports broadcaster, who}
Monday evening said that the players, after arriving in Dearborn,
Michigan, last Friday, were forced to take part in an unrevealed act

Immediately following the broadcast, the players branded as
pure “bunk’,’ the story that some of them had contemplated leaving
the squad. Aside from this,’ theye
were less talkative than Harpo
Marx in a muzzle.

“We’re not concerned about the
past,” said one ﬁrst stringer. ‘‘All
that we are worried about is win-
ning every game from here on
in.” .
Although the broadcaster re-
fused to reveal the source of his
information, the "informant is

miles for purposes of limbering
up. This is customary procedure.’
The story that perhaps has some
basis tells of discontentment on the ’;
part of the players over food ar-f
rangements. The reply to this is.
that in order to make train con-

nec-tions, supper had to be post-
poned two hours. Furthermore,

“laid down” against Michigan 
refuted simply by the fact that
they held the powerful Wolverines
scoreless for a full quarter.

are the varsity’s gains, but last

.week the situation was reversed. George “Buck” Johnson, veteran Pitt
guard, left the varsity squad to become a freshman coach.
A number of rapidly accumulating factors lead Buck to ﬁnally
‘ decide that active participation as a player was not for him.
Throughout this season, he was troubled by the lack of sight
in one eye. Added irritation was provided by an ailing right leg in

year’s Notre Dame game. The leg

On top of Johnson’s physical

From the very start, Buck has
always regarded football as an
indespensable. After playing at
German Township High, he en-

he made ‘Buff Done1li’s squad and
ended the season in the Orange
Bowl, where the Dukes defeat-

ed Mississippi State. -
Going into the armed forces
in 1943, Buck took a two year re-

cess from the gridiron.

During his tenure as a Pitt
gridder, he played under Shangh-
uessy, Fesler, and Milligan. Now

a coach, Buck will be graduated ,

in June but hopes to continue in
this profession. .

So today, he is riding up the hill,
to the practice ﬁeld in Frosh Coach
Doc Hartwig’s car, and his former
teammat'e’s are addressing him. as
“coach." Thus, the combined in-
struction of Johnson and Hartwig,
who was an All-American guard
at Pitt in 1934, should produce
some capable guards for future
Pitt varsities.

Statistic Sheet Issued

The ﬁrst statistics sheet of the
Centers attendance has been re-
ceived by Mr. Adams.

The sheet shows that there are
199 different schools represented
at the center. Students have come
from as far north as “Old Town,
Maine,” “Concord, New Hamp-
shire,” as far south as “Orlando,
Florida,” “New Orleans, Louisi-

ana,’ as far east as “Akron, Ohio,” »

and “Youngstown, Ohio.” Many
distant Penna. towns are also rep-

These two are the Ellsworth
Eagles and the Slick Six. -As for
the standing of the teams the
Eagles have one game to their
credit. That game was a forfeit
from the Stallions, the third team
from the center. Due to this for-

Genetics Book
Aids Research

“Introduction to Genetics of
Habrobracon Juglandis Ashmead,”
is a book written by Dr. Albert
Martin, assistant professor of Bi-
ology at Mt. Mercy, and lecturer
at the University.

It is a reference text for those
engaged in experimental genetics,
containing the study and results
of investigations on the parasitic
hymenopteran Habrobracon, an
insect in the same order ;of the
common bee, yet no bigger than
a fruitﬂy.

Insects have proven a vital aid
‘in the study of inheritance be-
cause of the shortness of life and
their large number of progeny.
The ﬁeld of Hobrabraconology
was just recently opened, and be-
cause of the simpleness of the in-
sect a great advancement in ‘the
study of genetics is foreseen. The
book is new in use at Mt. Mercy
and the University.

Dr. Martin was a student of Dr.
G-eorge M. McKinley while at Pitt.
