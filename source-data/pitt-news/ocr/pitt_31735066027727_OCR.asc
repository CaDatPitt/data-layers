'I'UDEN'I'S ON

SGB President Justin in hands Trustee Secretary Bob Dunkleman the

student petition to keep Trustee committees open to students, faculty, and staff.

Student Government scrambles for names
in a last-ditch effort to keep student voice

The future of shared governance at
this University hangs in the balance
today, as the Pitt trustees decide
whether to kick faculty, staff, and stu-
dents off their board committees.

At their 8:30 meeting this morning
an ad hoc committee presented its
investigation of the matter to the full
Board.

Representatives from faculty, staff,
and student organizations have been
expecting the worst because so far the
investigative committee has kept the
details of its report a secret.

“I’ve been calling and calling, and
going over to their offices, but they
haven’t given us anything to go on,”
said Justin DalMolin, Student
Government Board president. “All we
can do is go to the meeting with the rest
of student government and show our
faces to show the Trustees how serious
we are, and how much support we have
to keep students on these committees.“

Because he received so little infor-
mation from the Trustees, DalMolin
said he exhausted every legal option to
find out what the report would recom-
mend.

“We can’t go in there and force
them to give us the report. We can’t
climb in through the window and steal

 

it,” he said. “All we can do is ask, and
if they feel the student government
isn’t important enough to give it to
them, then that’s what they decide. But
we think that is uncalled for.”

DalMolin said he had to go through
“other channels of information” to
devise his proposal.

“I talked to [Trustee Secretary]
Bob Dunkleman, I talked to
[University Senate] President Keith
McDuffie and Staff Association
Council President Brian Hart to find
out what they knew, and basically
asked around everywhere I could,”
DalMolin said.

To combat the move to kick stu-
dents off the committees, SGB orga-
nized a petition to show the Trustees
how many students were concerned.

In a brief meeting yesterday with
Dunkleman, DalMolin and board
member Christa Douaihy turned over
those signatures and the results of their
own research into this matter.

Dunkleman received the docu-
ments, but gave no indications of what
effect they would have.

“I haven’t had a chance to talk to
the chairman about how he wants to
handle it. We’ll find out tomorrow,”
Dunkleman said.

DalMolin was optimistic about the
affect the petition would have.

TRUSTEE COMMITTEES?

Student committee
members explain
their contribution

‘Ben'amin Jackson

There has been a small uproar
over the possible removal of facul-
ty, staff, and students from the
Board of Trustees committees. Yet
very little has been said about who
these students are, how they get
there, and what they actually do.

Students are appointed to the
Board of Trustees committees by
the Office of Student Affairs.
According to Dennis Donham, the
chairman of the Board asks the vice
chancellor for student affairs to rec-
ommend students.

Donham said that when these
request come through, they have
gone to the student government
groups to ask them for nominees.

“We ask them for people they
know will be interested and com-
mitted to going to the meetings,”
Donham said. “Last year, the
request came very late, for whatev-
er reason. We tried to get a hold of
[then—SGB President] Andy
Wuertele, but he wasn’t around.”

No students who were recom-
mended were denied by the current
chairman or any previous chairman
in recent history, according to
Donham. The only feedback the
Office of Student Affairs receives
on the student appointees is a log
on attendance at the meetings. He
said that people are not often re-
appointed to the committees after
their term because “We tend to
regard that as something that need-
ed a lot of participation.”

The decision to remove stu-
dents came from a concern that fac-
ulty, staff, and students would cir-
cumvent the proper channels if they
serve on the committees, according
to Erika Nanz, the president of the
College of General Studies Student
Government Council.

“[The trustees] didn’t want fac-
ulty students and staff running
around the chancellor to the Board
of Trustees, and we didn’t want the

Villagers unearth fossilized
dinosaur eggs in field

Around the World

BAALBEK, Lebanon — A radio station
run by Hezbollah was severely damaged
yesterday when Israeli warplanes bombed
it, in addition to bases located outside of
Beirut and near the border with Syria.
Lebanese officials said that the Voice of
the Oppressed radio station was struck by
four air-to-surface missiles, sending itoff
the air.

Israel has been trying to weaken the
Hezbollah Shiite Muslim group by target-
ing its supplies and propaganda outlets.
They have targeted this same radio station
in the past with less success. Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
confirmed the raids but didn’t go into fur-

. ther detail.

This raid came in the middle of
Israeli discussions about whether to pull
their troops from southern Lebanon or
not. Since 1985, ﬁghting with the Iranian-
backed Hezbollah gucrillas has killed 18]

Israeli soldiers. Associated Press

PISDURA, India — Villagers have
uncovered more than 300 fossilized
dinosaur eggs as they plowed their wheat
and cotton ﬁelds. The Indian farmers
thought that they were only stumbling
over rocks, but what they have been find-
ing over the past several years are actual-
ly six-inch long and three-inch wide oval-
shaped eggs. .

“The villagers did not know the
importance of the fossils,” said Dr. Gyani
Badarn, an Indian paleontologist. The vil-

lagers also found fossilized bones and sea
shells in the area. Badarn said that the
eggs were from dinosaurs who lived 65
million years ago during the Cretaceous
period. These remain from an era when
these dinosaurs were dying out and could
provide clues about what brought about
the demise of the dinosaurs.

Local Indian farmer Kisna Dadmal
said, “What is it to me? These are just like
stones. People come in cars to take them
away. They look like animal bones, but it
had to be a very big animal.” Associated

CHICAGO, Ill. —— After protesting
against a company that is a member of his
own civil rights coalition, Rev. Jesse
Jackson was charged with disorderly con—
duct on Tuesday and spent the night in
jail. Jackson, along with two other protes-
tors, was arrested for blocking the
entrance to a construction site supervised
by a white-owned company that ended’ a
contract with a black—owned trucking
company. a

“We ﬁght for workers seeking an
honorable day of work,” Jackson told the
judge during his arraignment. “I am sacri-
ﬁcing my liberty for their freedom to get
attention from the courts, the city, the
county, and the state.”

He turned down the judge’s offer to
go free on his own recognizance and
spent the night in the Cook County Jail
awaiting sentencing. Associated Press

Pitt buses currently stop on Bigelow; some say closing the road will harm service.

Will Pitt shuttles still be
the quicker-picker-upper?

Ben A. Berzai

 

The temporary closing of
Bigelow Boulevard last semester
has raised questions about how a
permanent closing would impact the
efficiency of Pitt’s shuttle system.

Late shuttles, delayed shuttles,
and shuttles that don’t show up are
a common ‘occurrence at this
University. If Bigelow Boulevard is
permanently closed, officials say
the problem could worsen.

Student groups and faculty have
rallied for the closing of the busy
Boulevard with hopes of turning it
into a central campus area, but
those students who use the shuttle
to get to their off—campus homes
want the street to remain open.

Bigelow, considered the main
artery for all eight of the
University’s shuttle loops, is essen-
tial to the efficiency of the current
bus routes. If it is closed, the shut-
tle system’s effectiveness could suf-
fer.

_“Depending on traffic, we are
late, at the most, five minutes,” said
Dan Chaski, a campus shuttle dri-
ver. “If Bigelow closes permanent-
ly, then the buses will run twice as
slow.”

During the trial closing of
Bigelow Boulevard last fall, shuttle
schedules were altered. Shuttles
were forced to travel an additional
block to Bellefield Avenue, causing
them to pass three more stoplights

than on the current route to the
pick-up zone in front of the William
Pitt Union.

This change caused drivers a
considerable amount of trouble.

“Turning on Bellefield is mur-
der,” said Chaski.

But administrators in the
Department of Parking and
Transportation say that the routes
were detoured because the closing

of Bigelow was for such a short

time.

John Morgan, assistant director
of transportation for the University,
said the shuttle routes would be
altered if Pittsburgh City Council
would pass the permanent closing
proposal. He said new, more effi-
cient, loops would be drawn which
take the new traffic patterns into
account.

Passenger cars added to the con-
gestion in the Union driveway
where shuttles turned around during
the closing, further delaying shuttle
schedules.

The Union driveway is one of
the reasons that Morgan supports
the closing.

“It gives the students one cen-
tral area for pick-up,” said Morgan.

Chaski, who doesn’t support the
closing, said that major renovations
would have to occur before new
routes could be effective. He said
closing Bigelow and creating new
routes sounds simple, but major
construction would be needed to
consider the project a success.

Mookerjee 

a visiting professor. Students in the GSPIA
program consistently remark on his
impressive teaching ability and his clarity
in discussing economics. Many call him an
asset to the program. They point to his pop-
ularity as a teacher and his ability to ﬁll a
classroom with 30 to 40 students. Most
other economics professors in GSPIA only
draw about four to ﬁve.

“Mookerjee fostered an interest in eco-
nornics that I never thought I had,” said Sal
Gomez, president of the GSPIA student
cabinet. “That’s true of a lot of students,
and why many wholeheartedly support
him.”

Many students said they cannot under-
stand why Mookerjee, who was voted the
best professor within GSPLA last semester,
is not among the ﬁnal ﬁve candidates for
the assistant professorship.

They said this is a clear sign that
GSPIA is not taking student concerns into
consideration. Some said this is a cu1rnina—
tion of a problem which has been going on
for some time, and that it’s causing the pro-
gram to decay. ' .

A search committee was appointed
last year for the purpose of reviewing the
more than 300 applicants for the position.
Because Mookerjee was excluded, many
of his students now question the criteria the
search committee uses to make their deci-
sions.

‘The truth is we don’t have one set cri-
teria,” said Schroeder. “Everybody has
their own criteria and many times it just
doesn’t mesh.”

As a student in the GSPIA program,
Schroeder said she wanted a solid teacher
who could impart knowledge.
Unfortunately, others on the committee
have differing personal agendas.

Carolyn Ban, GSPIA dean, said she
thought teaching, research, and service
were essential in the person who would ﬁll
the position.

Schroeder said research was impor-
tant, but that classroom skills were even
more necessary.

“If these candidates can’t make an
impact in teaching, then they are useless,”
she said. “I prefer candidates who have a
research background, but above everything

else I want them to be good teachers. Not ‘

everybody on the committee shares that
sentiment.”

Ban would not comment on why she
thought Mookerjee didn’t ﬁt the job
description. Ban said she’s only had her job
for six weeks and doesn’t “know him well
enough.”

The process and an outside professor

Throughout the past few months, the
committee narrowed the pool of candidates
down to ﬁve and is now in the process of
evaluation.

Out of the final ﬁve, only two have
their doctorates, and the other three have
yet to receive their Ph.D’s and do not have
experience teaching graduate students_.
Many students are angry that Mookerjee,
who holds his doctorate and is involved in

 

Thursday, February 20, ‘I 997

 

ROM PAGE I "" "

ongoing research, did not make the cut.

“They have gone ahead with the old
criteria of getting new candidates and
many of those candidates have been found
to be people who have just completed their
Ph.D.,” said Jayamohan Thanrnalingarn.
“Some of them have a few papers to sub-
mit before they get their Ph.D., and others
already have their Ph.D. but they have very
limited teaching experience with graduate
students. This is very upsetting to the stu-
dents in GSPIA.”

One of the ﬁnal candidates who held a
doctorate, Robert Chase, decided not to
pursue the open position in GSPIA. This
leaves room for a new ﬁfth candidate.
Many say it should be Mookerjee.

“In essence, he is sort of still in the
pool for the ﬁfth position that Robert Chase
has vacated,” said Schroeder.

A few graduate students have even
denounced the committee as a ﬂawed
process. They accuse the committee of
showing bias against Mookerjee because
he is an outside professor who is popular
among students.’

‘The general feeling among students
is that this guy is being victimized because
he is good,” said Thanmalingarn.
“Excellence is something we should look
forward to; we should not feel threatened
by excellence, and I suppose some people

are feeling threatened by his teaching abi1- ,

ity and his popularity among students.”

But many graduate students stand
behind the current search committee and
are open to other suggestions for filling the
position.

‘There is a group of students who sup-
port Mookerjee vocally, but there are other
students who are ambivalent and want to
see what the other candidates are like,” said
Gomez. “They want to sit back and see the
other candidates and what they have to
offer before deciding on Mookerjee,
because they may pass up a really talented
professor.”

Some graduate students still hesitate to
say a majority of students stand behind
Mookerjee and the call to abandon the pre-
sent search committee.

“It has been difficult for [the GSPIA
student cabinet] to tell if we are dealing
with a majority or a very vocal minority of
the students,” said David Billings, vice
president of the GSPIA student cabinet. “A
number of students may be afraid to come
out and voice their concerns and that
makes it hard for us to discern what the
majority fee .”

The search committee was formed last
year before Ban started her job as dean.

Some grad students believe that since
the current committee was created before
Ban came in, she should suspend the com-
mittee because of student protest and initi-
ate plans to form a new one.

However, Ban has stated that she has
no intention of doing any such thing.

“The process of academic hiring is that
a search committee is appointed. They do
the preliminary screening and they do the

initial ranking of the candidates,” said Ban.
“That is the procedure that we follow here
at Pitt and I think it is important that we fol-
low and honor that procedure and respect
it. Suspension of the committee would be
an extraordinary action, and it certainly
would not be an action I want to take as a
new dean walking in the door.”

A Decaying Program?

Students say the Mookerjee controver-
sy is a sign that GSPIA is not taking student
concems into consideration. Some said this
problem has been going on for some time,
and that it’s causing the program to decay.

But Ban said GSPIA is a strong pro-
gram that may need only some improve-
ment.

She also said that while there are some
students who are unhappy, there is not the
widespread dissatisfaction that others feel
is prevalent.

“I think this is a very competitive pro-
gram. One of the current indicators of qual-
ity is that Pitt’s [Masters of Public Affairs]
degree is ranked thirteenth nationally,” said
Ban. “I think that’s something that we’re
justifiably proud of. I think the [Masters of
Public and International Affairs] degree is
also first rate and in the top tier of MPIA
degrees in the country and widely recog-
nized as such. So do I think the program is
in terrible shape, no I don’t. Are there areas
where we can improve things? Deﬁnitely.”

Barr has stated her intention to improve
the level of enrollment and the quality of
the GSPIA program. She has also placed

student concerns at the top of her list.

“From my personal view and from the
view from the school as a whole we care
very much about the students,” said Ban.
“I’m very happy that they care as much as
they do about the school. It is sad that it
appears to them that we don’t care because
that is not at all true.”

Already in her six weeks as dean of
GSPIA, Ban has talked with students about
the direction of the
program on a fomial
and informal level.
She said she has met

said. “We can think about what is happen-
ing in the ﬁelds that we teach and we can
be at the cutting edge of those ﬁelds. That
process is being carried out by a committee
that includes faculty, staff, and students.”
Ban is also looking ahead to next year

ments of the pro-

Other students refute the statements

that GSPIA has changed and point to the
Mookerjee incident as proof. Some of them
said the promises to consider student con-
cerns are lies, because they have heard all
these things before and have seen nothing
improve.

“I really see students in a cynical

Schroeder. “ Ban has said that she is going

remains the problem of sustained student
discontent that goes deeper than Mookerjee
and the search committee. The feeling that
GSPIA is not challenging and does not ade-
quately prepare students for the job market
is something students have begun to voice.

“Pitt has a tradition, one that is found-
ed on excellence. Now it is headed towards
mediocrity, and if it goes on, then probably
students will be turned away from Pitt,”
said Thamnalingam. “I found from stu-
dents who have graduated and who will be
graduating that they feel very unhappy
with the way things have been done here
and they do not want to have anything to do
with Pitt once they leave.

‘These people are going to be the
alumni and they are supposed to support
the University. This is their alma mater, and
if they don’t want to have anything to do
with it, then this shows that something is
very wrong.”

‘This should show them
how students feel,”
DalMolin said. “They can’t
ignore us anymore.”

His search for clues as
to what the committee will
recommend led him to a res-
olution stating that non-
trustee members should be
allowed into the closed
executive sessions, that a
non-College of General
Studies undergraduate stu-
dent should be allowed to sit
in on all 11 standing com-
mittees, and that the Board
set up a committee with stu-
dent, faculty, and staff lead-
ers to determine whether the
current power structure is
efficient.

DalMolin’s proposal
states that this will create an
environment “where all
constituencies feel ade-
quately represented.”

But the proposal has no
binding power, and the
Trustees can choose to dis-
regard it with no legal con-
sequences.

“But they will have con-
sequences,” DalMolin said.
“They have to realize they
can’t just brush off the

entire undergraduate non-
CGS population.”

Of the 11 committees in

question, only four have
undergraduate representa-
tion. Of those four, there are
only eight undergraduate
student representatives.

Of those students, three
are CGS, one is from the
Greensburg campus, and
only four are from the non-
CGS Oakland campus.

“This isn’t right,”
DalMolin said. “This isn’t
adequate representation.”

If the votes are lost,
DalMolin said this can still
work to the undergraduate
population’s advantage.

“I want non—CGS stu-
dents on all of the 1] com-
mittees,” he said. “If they
can’t vote, that’s fine. But I
want them there so we can
keep track of what is going
on. That isiimportant. That
is essential.”

But if the Trustees vote
today to remove students,
faculty, and staff from their
committees, there’s no way
to determine how these
groups will gain inﬂuence
in the future.

other way around to happen,
and not know what was going
on,” Nanz said.

The students who actually
serve on the committees gave
mixed reports of how they
were received.

Althea Rodgers, an under-
graduate history major who
serves on the athletics commit-
tee, said that she received little
preparation, and that the
Trustees on her committee
were not receptive to her sug-
gestions.

“When I was told that I
was on the committee, nobody
told me why, what my job was,
or what I was supposed to do. I
just got a letter saying there
was a meeting, so I went,”
Rodgers said.

The committee seemed to
be just as surprised at her pres-
ence as she was at being
named a member of the com-
mittee.

“I raised my hand to say
something, and they all looked
at me like I had three heads,”
Rodgers related. “It wasn’t
mentioned in the minutes that I
even spoke.”

Nanz gave a different view
of the committees.

Thursday, February 20, I997

 

“I’ve been to one meeting,
which was basically an intro-
duction meeting,” Nanz said.
“I’ve been to student affairs
committee meetings; I really
think that they’re interested
what we have to say.”

Michele Cline, a graduate
student in health administra-
tion and business, said that
while the trustees seemed will-
ing to listen, the students did-
n’t seem interested in speaking
up.

“I think a lot of students sit
there and refrain from speak-
ing because of the company
they’re in,” Cline said.

All the students surveyed
thought students would proba-

. bly not keep their current place

in the committee structure.

“I believe that they proba-
bly are [going to remove to
students]” Rodgers said. “They
don’t seem interested in what
we have to say.”

Nanz said that she also
expected the students, faculty,
and staff from the committees

~ at today’s meeting. She based

her prediction on a meeting the
student government groups
had with Chairman I. W.
Connolly in the summer.

“It was told to us that this
is what is happening,” Nanz
said.

She believed that students
would be able to contact the
trustees in some other capacity.

“We wrote a letter —
Brian Ulery, myself, and Andy
Wuertele — saying that we
would like to be kept in some
other capacity. We stressed that
we wanted to make sure our
opinions are heard,” Nanz
said.

All the committee mem-
bers said that they believed
removing students would be a
deleterious action for the
University. At the same time,
all said that committee mem-
bership wouldonly be valuable
if it was more than symbolic.

“It’s only important if they
take what we have to say seri-
ously,” Rodgers said.

At the same time, the
members said that this is a
shared responsibility.

“The only suggestions I
have is for students to be more
active,” Cline said. “It would
be a poor idea to take faculty,
students, and staff off. We’re
the ones influenced by the
decisions first.”

Since the tragic death of their minister,
local college students from the Christian
Student Fellowship Organization are trying to
carry on with the tradition of volunteering at
the CSF oﬂice, and maintaining weekly pro-
grams sponsored by the organization.

Sam Brunsvold was shot to death outside
his home on Jan. 28 while returning from a
bible study session.

Brunsvold was a minister to the Christian
Student Fellowship located in the New Hope
Central Christian Church on Dithridge Street,
is an organization designed especially for col-
lege students.

These students, from the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and
Point Park College, ananged an “oﬂice help”
schedule during regular business hours.
Volunteers perform various clerical duties,
plan Friday evening worship activities, and
schedule temporary substitute ministers for
Friday evening worship sermons.

The substitute ministers are from the
Pittsburgh area and attend Friday evening

THE PITT NEWS

Students carry on church activities after brutal murder of minister

worship. They follow Brunsvold’s itinerary,
which includes one theme per month. The
theme for February is “Dealing VV1th Life’s
Pressures.”

Although the itinerary of worship and
themes for sennons were planned by
Brunsvold in December, the group is making
some changes to the itinerary and planning
weekly post—worship activities such as parties
and ice skating.

The CSF has also received outside sup-
port in the wake of this tragedy. Carnegie
Mellon is lending a 15—passenger van to the
Christian Student Fellowship because they no
longer have a pemranent vehicle to provide
transportation to off-carnpus activities. This
allows them to provide transportation for the
post—worship activities.

the future new campus minister.

that Sam had for our ministry,” said Kim

Christian Student Fellowship, and the CSF
students will interview and select a new min-
ister this summer.

The students are going through an adjust-
ment period because of the varying styles of
sermon. Despite these adjustments, students
are happy to have elders present who can give
them insight.

“We all have a common belief in Christ
and we can click with the guest ministers.”
said Keller, "They give us consolation and we
can trust them”

Guest ministers and outside support can
only help so much. Although these students
are working together and making only minor
adjustments to the program, many are experi-
encing diﬂiculty maintaining the program
along with their regular daily schedules.

In addition to her full-time internship at
the Central Christian Church, Keller worked

ment of The Pitt News and took eight credits
at Pill.

DuetotheincreasedneedattheCSF,

Carnegie Mellon University and president of

the Counsel of Ministers, the CSF leadership ,

group, works in the oﬂioe four out of ﬁve days
a week, when he is not in class or studying.

In addition to Keller and Stitely, a Pit
alumni and two other Pitt students and a CMU
student contribute about 40 hours a week in
the oﬂioe. “We are willing to sacriﬁce because
we want to keep this group active.” said
Keller, “Sam created the New Hope CSF
because it was one of his dreams.”

Keller is organizing a binder of
Brunsvold’s ambitions, including his plans to
build a diverse community for CSF students,
letters he wrote to students this past summer
while they were out of town, and his views on
the challenges of ministry, such as maldng
major life decisions.

Students in this organization traditionally

have participated both in group projects and ‘

independent projects.

As a result, many students are prepared to
independently manage the organization until a
new campus minister is assigned.

“When discussing the structure of our
group,” said Keller, “Sam ananged everything
so the students could have leadership.”

Grab your bullhorns and signs,
student activism is on the rise

Let’s march on Washington, or at least the
University. Students have picked up the banner and
become activists fighting not to be kicked out of the
Board of Trustees and for the hiring of a professor
they find outstanding. Great! '

If Pitt is to have a corporate mentality, then it
must listen to the comments of its students, who
are, in this system, its customers.

Pitt is a corporation, and it must work on
improving its product, a quality education. You
can’t return an education if you think it’s defective.
You can’t get a rebate on the four (or more) years of
your life you spend at this institution. Sure, stu-
dents can leave or transfer to another school if they
so choose. However, is this what the University is
aiming for — the mass exodus of its students? Why
not give the students a University of which they can
be proud? One from which they will hang their
diplomas with pride?

Students, if you are going to be activists, do it
right. Learn to use the system for your advantage.
Find out how the system works. Manipulate it from
the inside and out. Find out what deadlines, proce-
dures, etc. there are for lodging complaints and

proposing ideas. Make some waves, but don’t wan— ‘

der off the beaten path until you have to.

But once you have to wander off of that path,
give ‘em hell. If the system won’t grant you the
access you need to make changes you want, find a
way to circumvent or destroy it. If it’s broke, some-
times you’ve just got to throw it away and get a
new one.

When you go off to fight the wooly mammoth
of the University, have a strategy. Be sure that you
are fighting for the right thing. Fully understand the
situation and problem. And carry plenty of ammu-
nrtron.

This ﬁrst column is in- response
to the article last week in regards to
allegations that the new
CampusFunds program is creating a
sort of monopoly and the resulting
vote by the Student Government
Board to keep the Choice Dollar sys-
tem intact. I am going to try to clari-
fy this issue because I would like to
ensure that the students get the infor_—
mation about the issues regarding
the Choice Dollar system which
brought about the advent of
CampusFunds.

Choice Dollars, when it was
created by Student
Government Board
several years ago,
was implemented so
students would have
the choice to eat at
establishments other
than the Towers
cafeteria. Now, if
you remember, this
was before Eddie’s
existed, and before you could use
blocks at Schenley.

As it became popular, local
establishments found it to be a great
advantage to accept choice dollars
because students would much rather
have their bill sent home to mommy
and daddy than spend their own
cash. Therefore, a demand from
businesses to be able to accept
Choice Dollars sprang up. Due to
limited technical abilities by the
University, not all of the vendors had
this option available.

This is when the bidding start-
ed, and you the student got screwed.
It went from Student Government

 

Board wanting as many vendors as

possible to have Choice Dollar capa- .

bilities to the the University cashing
in on the high demand and the high-
est possible bidders. The established
rates which these vendors had to pay
the University as a usage fee is
believed to be from 12 percent to as
high as 19 percent. This means if
you spent $10 on Choice Dollars the
University would collect from $1.20
to $1.90 of your money.

Now, if you are a business that
had to pay this fee, knowing you will
get more business because you have
outbid the competition, and they do
not have Choice Dollar capabilities,
would you raise your prices know-
ing that students will pay? Hell yes!

So, knowing this is anti-com-
petitive and creates a
monopolistic envi-
ronment for Choice
Dollar vendors, how
do you ﬁx it? The
answer, or rather, the
best answer so far, is
to create a system for
a card which would
be accepted every-

 

competition among vendors for our
business, with a low usage fee of
about three percent to be used to pay
for the system itself, and outsource it
to a company with the technical
capabilities to pull it off, say
American Express. I g

It just so happens we will have
this system next semester with
CarnpusFunds. That is the most real-
istic answer available, and the
answer is obviously not to vote to
keep the anti-competitive, outdated
Choice Dollar system intact.

Battles over whether the government
or private interests ought to work to solve

I» this country’s problems have raged on for

what seems like forever, especially in
light of last year’s presidential election.
Perhaps there is a suggestion or two to be
advanced that have little to do with poli-
ties.

In one sense, the conservatives are
right, the government can’t ﬁx every-
thing. At the sarne time, private industry,
as it stands, does not care about this coun-

try. Most major corporations are multina- .

tionals that will move into whatever
country throws the most beneﬁts at their
feet. I

What we need are some new corpo-
rations. Corporations that are willing to
provide for their workers. What we need
are some idealistic young people to start
businesses which act as beneﬁciaries.

Now is the time for a brief historical
interlude. A few years ago, Ice-T came to
Pitt to speak. He spoke for about two
hours one evening, and one of the focal
points of his speech was how to ﬁx the
problems in this country.

His suggestions were that it was up to
young people to change things.

“You guys become young capitalist
guerrillas, educated capitalist guerrillas
—— yuppies forget where they come
from,” Ice-T said.

He went to say that we must intellec-
tually undermine the system and remem-
ber where we came from.

We have to get into the system
and and change it from within.

“We’ve got to get money. Without
money we’re like hippies, nothing will
happen," Ice-T saidp '

Now, this seems a little simple to say.
Michael Moore’s book “Downsize This:
Random Threats from an Unarmed
American” puts things into a clear light.
He talks about how the working man is
deceived and shifted around until he does-
n’t know which way is up. It’s not just the
working man, it’s also the working moth-
er of three who is trying to support her
kids on a minimum wage job and can’t
get any health insurance.

Moore talks about holding the corpo-
rations responsible and harkens back to
the good ol’ days when corporations took
care of their employees.

These things set me to think. Ice-T
said that Jello Biafra once told him “For
every problem, spend a whole day think-
ing about a solution.”

Nowadays, with everyone so ‘pressed
for time, people tend not to think for even
a whole minute about a solution.
Nonetheless, by a synthesis of these two

ore and saving America's people

Find a way to merge philanthropy
and capitalism. The trick is to ﬁnd what
made those corporations that actually
took care of their workers tick. The capi-
talism of more halcyon days.

Now, there are a large number of cor-
porations that have always taken advan-
tage of their workers and will continue to
do so.

As a conservative banker once told
me, if the companies would just take care
of their workers, they wouldn’t have to
worry about unions. Imagine that — cor-
porate responsibility.

So, here’s what we do. We form a
young, urban, guerrilla army. The aim of
this army will be to create quality jobs for
people so that they can live quality lives.

Like Ice-T said: “Use the system to
the maximum to help the people who are
down.”

The only problem with this is that the
system isn’t always so keen on helping
people who are down. So perhaps what
we need to do is start a whole new system.

It is time for us to start business, cre-
ate a new General Motors and not to for-
get who we are when we ﬁnd it and
become successful. Then, we’ll honestly
be able to say that what is good for what
ever our new GM is is also good for the
country.

Incorporating public service into
business is a partnership made in heaven.
Yet, we must remember that we can’t fol-

low the old forms of using success to
reward ourselves. We must plow it back
into the people whose hard work has
made us successful. We have to revitalize
our neighborhoods, educate our children
and our adults, and help make the country
a livable place.

We must make something besides
money. That’s what the lemmings of the
‘80s did and look where that got us —
inner cities in worse shape than Beruit
ever was, conditions in Appalachia where
medical students from the third world
study so they will be able to help their
homelands, and demagogues who lie to
us and still take public ofﬁce. We have to
produce actual products so that there actu-
ally is something to buy when we say buy
American.

We must also take care of the work-
ers we employ. As workers, we must also
take care of our company, so that it can
continue to take care of us. It is only when
there is a mutual atmosphere of trust
rather than suspicion that we’ll come to a
mutually beneﬁcial arrangement. Trickle
down economics only allowed the upper
classes to trickle on the lower ones.

As Abbie Hoffman said, the future is
still ours, if we choose to reach out and
take it.

Students deserve quality teaching

How many students schedule their
classes by looking at the last name of
the instructors teaching them? How
many students have walked into a
class only to find a professor or TA
who is not able to speak understand-
able English? I have experienced the
aforementioned situations far too
often. I have gone to the departmental
head and complained. Nothing has
happened. I would like to tell the
University officials, professors, and
teaching assistants to
beware. Undergraduate
students must force
those who are virtually
employed by them to be
accountable for their

Skills Center. These UTAs are respon-
sible for holding recitations twice a
week. Twice a semester, each UTA is
observed by his supervisor. A meeting
is scheduled to review both good and
bad points of the observation. If found
below standard level, the supervisor
will not allow the UTA to teach. Is
this such a difficult concept? If you
cannot work at an expected level, you
will no longer work. We should all
strive for excellence in what we do,
but if we can get away
with less than excel-
lence due to a lack of
checks and balances,
won’t we?

One argument I

actions, whether those
actions are good or bad.

When working in
industry, performance
dictates salary, position, and whether
or not one will have a job the next
day. Why should a college campus
work any differently? What happens
to the teaching evaluations we fill out
every term for every professor? We,
the employer, should determine if a
professor is capable of teaching at a
standard level. And this standard
should not be unreasonable. Basic

board skills, eye contact, summariz— .

ing, etc. is taught to every undergrad-
uate teaching assistant at the Learning

Spiclermcm pjs, and The A-Team

 

While performing my pencil-pushing
nine to ﬁver last summer, I found myself
caught up (eavesdropping) in a conversation
between four kids during my lunch break at
Mickey D’s. They rapped about their
friends: who’s locked up, who shot who,
who stole what, who got kicked out of what.
They were all 12 and under, and already
knew courtroom procedures  And all I
could do was think to myself, “What the
hell is going on? ”

Call me a nostalgia freak, but damn, I
miss the old days. Is it me or were times just
a tad bit easier for us growing up as big-
headed little boys and girls than for the kid-
dies coming up today? I’m not that old, but
I’m old enough to remember never having
to dodge bullets after school. Now little girls
are losing their lives over earrings on sub-
way platforms.

I got rruttin’ but love for all the little
brothers and sisters struggling to mature in
  .......................................... ..
Promises” era. Never was
there more negative pres-
sure put on a little rascal
to survive than in
Amerikkka’s deteriorat-

But how can they
survive if every image,
every message, every
moral they experience is
designed to keep them
forever confused, like
hamsters on a cage wheel? They’re moving
in the right direction, but for some reason,
they never end up where they want to go.
VV1th a sea of corporate and political ﬁsh
showing us that money and power are all
that matters, it’s no wonder so many kids
these days are falling into drug and crime-
infested waters. And they’re drowning.

The innocence of childhood has been
lost. The art of using your imagination has
been played out and replaced by Sony and
Sega, television and top dollars. What’s the
need to concoct kooky games outside when
the Nintendo’s itching for attention? A

People don’t talk to young bucks any-
more. Some parents don’t raise their chil-
dren anymore. No one schools them on the
rules of life like they used to, including
many of us. Television does it. And it has to
stop.

As a wee laddie, every moming before
school, I’d spring from under my Retum of
theJedi bed sheets and head for the 19-inch
TV in the living room. Scarﬁng down dig-
gum smack doses of Smurf Beny Crunch, I
sat “Indian style” in my Spiderrnan pj’s,
watching Fat Albert school Rudy on why
listening to loud music was dangerous, and
Brainy Smurf get tossed from the mush-
room village. As milk dribbled from my bot-
tom lip, it felt good to be a kid.

In school, we “ooo-oooed” for chances

 

at top classroom duties. You had clout if you
were the board eraser and washer.We
sneaked kisses with cuties under rectangular
desks, and rrrade milk carton Easter baskets.
At recess, we played Super Friends. You
could ﬂy if you’d put your jacket hood over
your head, spread your anrrs, and run real
fast so the jacket would rise like a cape in the
wind. And you were clowned if you had to
be Wonder Woman. I was always The Flash,
because I was faster than everybody else.

In the afternoons, after school, after

homework, I ran around the neighborhood
with my buddies in the tight Sergio Valente
jeans, nasty orange turtleneck, and Pro—Kecls
Ma’Dukes picked out. We’d explore the
neighborhood like pirates in search of buried
treasure.
(One time, we dug for dinosaur bones in my
mom’s backyard, but she started trippin‘
about the huge hole in the yard. “Boy, if you
don’t put that dirt back ...”)

Bugs zoos were a necessity. We
scooped up insects in Darne’s backyard,
 earthworms, “elephant”
spiders, put them in a jar,
and tried to sneak it in the
house past the mom and
pop, just to scare your lit-
tle sister 
We played tackle football
in the middle of Carnac
Street, stopping every 25
seconds for a car to cruise
by. We played 1-2-3 Red
 Light under blinding
street lamps, sneaking extra steps every tirrre
the caller tunred her back. A ﬁght broke out
over butt cheek injuries in wall ball, and

Mother May 1, big wheels, and water guns,

it was all fun 

On weeknights, after dinner, after baths,
I cheered for Faoeman and B.A. Baracus ‘til
bed time. Sometimes mom would let me
stay up to watch Automan (you know you
remember Automan, the computer dude
with the thing that cursor thing with the
car that made 90 degree tums?... forget it ...)
And mom read to me 

Do we really need to discuss the “Full
your pants down so I can beat you with this
switch, while your older siblings laugh at
you in the other room” beatings. Daddy did-
n’t whip, he whooped that backside. It hurt
like mad, but it happened for a purpose 
discipline and love.

Love. We need to bring back that love.
We need to embrace these children today,
show them that people do still care. Even if
it’s your little brother, sister, or cousin, let
them know you’re there for them. Of course
they’ll probably dis you and call you old and
corny, but at least they know who they can
turn to when the going gets tough 

Theron C. Warren still can’t sit down from
some of those whoopings, but it was worth
it.

Whoa Nellie, sit
down and think
about what
you've done

 

SPORTSVIEW  

  

 

The biggest question in Dallas for
years was: Who shot J .R.? The latest
question down in Big D is: Who is going
to shoot Don Nelson?

Nellie, who has had stints with the
Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State
Waniors, and ‘New York Knicks, has

‘ only been the Mavericks General man-

ager for less than two weeks. In that time
he has made drastic changes to a team
desperately in need of them.

But I don’t really think the fans in
Dallas had Nelson’s overhaul in mind. I
don’t think anyone but Nelson would
have ever guessed that this type of mon-
ster deal would ever be made.

The" New Jersey Nets aren’t com-
plaining, though.

The newest Nets are J immy Jackson,
Sam Cassell, George McCloud, All-Star
Chris Gatling and Eric Montross.

John Calipari, who has already lost
more games this season with the Nets
than he had in the past three seasons with
UMass, welcomed what could feasibly
be an entirejnew starting line-up. The
best thing for the Jersey boys is that they
gave up a freak of nature, an often
injured guy who’s had two decent sea-
sons, and a pair of great college players
who haven’t panned out at the next level
yet.

Everyone in Dallas knew that Jason
Kidd and Jimmy Jackson never got
along, ask Toni Braxton. Jamal
Mashbum has loads of potential but in
his four NBA seasons he had yet to
become the star many thought he would
be.

THURSDAY

Spring: time for Pitt's Action Jackson

 

SIT-DOWN

 

Corey Blauch sits down with the Pitt baseball head coach

The Pitt News: What are your
goals for this season?

Mark Jackson: The goals are
really the goals the players set
up. It’s their team. This year it
is the 1997 Pitt Baseball
Team. Their fate and destiny
is really in their hands. The
coaches are there to give the
players direction and leader-
ship. Their goal is to make the
Big East play-offs, which is a
reﬂection of what happened
last year when they did not
make the play-offs. They
want to get into a position to
do something. The players
had a meeting to set up their
goals. The coaches didn’t
attend. The players set up
short-range and long-range
goals.

TPN: How do you feel about
this year’s team?

M.J: Well there are some real
positive points. I would say
the attitude and work ethic are
good and that is very impor-
tant. For some reason that
wasn’t there last year.
Probably because of all the
success we had in ‘95.
Human nature being what it
is, people have a tendency to
relax after that accomplish-
ment [winning the 1995 Big
East Tournament]. I think that
happened last year and the
guys returning are a lot more
aware that you got to stay
positive and work hard all the
time.

TPN: What do you think the
strengths of the team are?

MJ: I think overall we can be
good in all areas. Most of our
pitchers have pitched in the
Big East and know what to
expect. New Pitching Coach
Joe Hill has had a full year to
work with the pitchers. So, I
think pitching would poten-
tially be a strength.

I would also say hitting is
a strength. We have guys who
hit well last year coming back
and we have new guys who
have the potential to hit well.
The players, for the most part,
seem to understand our offen-

Pitt head coach Mark Jackson has produced a perennial winner.

sive system. We feel we can
generate more runs than what
our offensive hitters might
dictate from their ability
alone. By that, I mean steal-
ing bases, bunting the ball,
running different kinds of
offensive, making it confus-
ing for the defense, and by
doing that, generating big
innings —- which is really the
goal of our offense. W e
led the country in stolen bases
in ‘93 and ‘94. Last year we
didn’t do a good job at all, we
were sixth in the country. Not
to say how good we are at
stealing bases, the point is
that teams do not defend the
steal very well. It is kind of
like a passing offense in foot-
ball, people don’t know how
to deal with it well and you
can take advantage of it and
create a lot more offense than
if you didn’t do it at all.

Last year we averaged
ﬁve runs a game and two
years before’ we averaged
eight runs a game. Last year
we lost eight games in the
conference by two runs or
less. The difference between
having a good season and a
so—so season, which is what

we had last year, is a real ﬁne
line. Instead of nine and 13
we could been over 500 and
in the play—offs.

TPN: Do you expect any
weaknesses?

MJ: I don’t see any weak-
nesses. There are no glaring
weaknesses. We still have to
work on different parts of the
game. I would say there is not
any area that we are real con-
cerned about.

TPN: Who do you see step-
ping it up this year?

MJ: Not really anyone. It is a
team effort. We are not count-
ing on anyone new or old to
carry the load. We have
enough talent that if one per-
son is not doing well then
someone can step in and do
well. There are nine guys that
start and we have about 14
guys who have a good shot to
be one of those nine. We
don’t have a lot of pitchers,
about nine and we start three
or four. We made some of the
position players into pitchers
because of the shortage of

pitchers. There is not anyone

who really looked good this V

preseason and will have a
breakthrough year. You never
really know who it will hap-
pen to. Josh Tyler was a solid
player and hit a little under
300 the past two years, then
in 1994 he hit .450 and was
the Big East player of the
year. So you really don’t
know.

TPN: How does the competi-
tion look like this year?

MJ: There really is not any
dominant teams. Every year it
is a surprise. They have a lot
of polls but those polls just
look at how many people are
back. They aren’t scientiﬁc
polls and they are a lot of
guessing. Last year, I think
we were picked second and
didn’t do that well. Two years
ago we were picked last and
won the play—offs.

TPN: Do you think baseball,
in - general, is losing its
“America’s Pastime” title?
What can be done?

MJ: Professional baseball has
lost popularity because of the
strikes. Statistics show that
the number of people going to
the ball parks is down; the
number of people watching it
on TV is down. I think the
players and owners need to be
more aware that the game
revolves around the fans and
not them. Personally, I have
lost interest in it because it
isn’t the same as it was when
I was a kid. They need a
strong commissioner like in
the NBA or the NFL.

College baseball doesn’t
draw very well, but I think it
has a lot of appeal. Some kids
get scholarships, but even at
big schools, like LSU and
Miami, they have kids who
are playing that are just walk-
ons. Kids play for the enjoy-
ment of the game and they
want to wear a uniform and
be a part of it. At college
games, the kids are up in the
dugout, where as, in profes-
sional baseball they are more
laid back.

Haggerty setting his
sights an NCAA prize

 

He’s been trying to study since 10 p.m.
By now, it’s almost 2 a.m., and Jonathan
Haggerty ﬁnally gives up. He jumps into
bed, stares at the ceiling, hoping his eyes will
close on their own. Haggerty tosses and
turns, trying to ﬁnd a comfortable position.
To no avail, he grabs the remote control and
ﬂicks on the TV.

This scenario can mean only one thing:
the Big East Swimming Championships are
ﬁnally here.

“It’s the hardest time of the year because
you’re resting and you have so much more
energy,” said Haggerty.

In preparation for the championships,
which started yesterday and will end

Sunday, Pitt’s swimmers began a type of

training known as
“tapering.” This
process involves reduc-
ing the intensity and
duration of workouts to
allow the body to
recover from the stren-
uous season and be
primed for the tough
Big East competition.
There is one side effect,
however: Pitt’s swirn—
mers are a little more
omery than usual. I

 

more energy now and
they don’t know what
to do with it,” said men’s Swimming Head
Coach Chuck Knoles as he watched one of
his swimmers performing a ﬂip into Trees
Pool.

“It’s like being on an energy high,” said
Haggerty, who hails from nearby Allison
Park. “You feel like you have to be doing
something all the time. You’re always walk-
ing around.”

Hopeﬁilly, Haggerty has enough energy
reserved for the championships.

At last year’s championships, he won
both the 100-butterﬂy (49.00) and the 200-
butterﬂy (1249.33). Haggerty says he’s about
two seconds ahead of last year, and the level
of competition should better those times.

“I swim better against somebody faster
than me. It’s a lot easier to shoot for a g ,”
he said.

Although Haggerty was “thrilled” to
win both events at the ‘96 championships, he
was disappointed because he failed to quali-
fy for the NCAAs. It seems that throughout
Haggerty’s career, he has never been satis-
ﬁed with anything but ﬁnishing at the top.

As a freshman at Hampton High
School, Haggerty was the WPIAL charnpi—
on in the 10()-butterﬂy and 200 M, and ﬁn-
ished fourth in the state in both events.

His sophomore year, he placed second
in the 100-butterﬂy and third in the 100-
backstroke at the WPIAL championships. At

states, Haggerty ﬁnished fourth in the 100-
butterﬂy. S

While most high school swimmers
would be satisﬁed with even qualifying for
those meets, Haggerty didn’t take them too
seriously.

“I was just there to be there,” he said.

In the back of his mind, Haggerty had
set higher goals.

In his junior and senior years, Haggerty
quit his high school team to concentrate on
Nationals. r

The summer before his senior year,
however, provided a major set—back.
Haggerty was clitfdiving in Butler and blew
out his eardrum.

“I just went down too far,” he said.

Haggerty didn’t swim at all that year,
and his stock as a recruit plummeted.
Schools still remained interested; how-

~ v   -A  -- ever, and Haggerty
chose Ohio University.

His choice was
more geographic than
academic.

“It’s out in the
middle of nowhere and
a river runs through it,”
said Haggerty, who was
also swayed because of
Ohio U’s coach.

Haggerty was
familiar to Ohio U’s
surroundings. His fami-
ly owns a 62-acre farm
in Butler where he
chased cows as a kid.
Nowadays, the bearded Haggerty returns to
hunt and ﬁsh in his spare time, which isn’t as
often as he would like.

In the free time he does have, Haggerty
watches wrestling’s “Monday Night Raw.”

“I plan my schedule around it,” he said
with a grin.

When Ohio U’s coach left after his
freshman year, Haggerty was free to transfer
His second choice was also geographic. His
home in Allison Park is only a twenty-
minute drive from Pitt, where he participat-
ed on the club team since childhood. The
coach he had then coaches him now.

“Jon’s had an immediate impact on our
scoring as a team,” said Knoles. “He’s
swimming faster and doing better in
schoo .”

“He’s more like a father to us than a
coach,” said Haggerty, who attributes his
academic improvement to his coach.

The farm—raised Haggerty, a natural sci-
ence major, has always wanted to work in
the outdoors.

“Even in high school, I wanted to work
in the ﬁsheries in Alaska,” he said.

When he graduates, Haggerty said he’d

This past week, the Pitt hockey
coaching staff said the team needed
to develop more of a killer instinct.
The players not only got that mes-
sage, but they sent one of their own
to the rest of the league.

Their message: They were the
number—one team going into the
play—offs, and they were the team to
beat.

After a three—game weekend, the
Panthers clinched first place in their
division with a 10-0-1 record. Friday
night, Pitt downed Edinboro 7-1;
Saturday, they knocked off Robert
Morris 6-5; and on Sunday, clinched
a first—round bye in the playoffs with
a 7-1 win over Allegheny.

“Going into the last game against
Allegheny, we knew if we won we’d
clinch first place,” Pitt’s Assistant
Coach Rick Niedt said. “We told
them we wouldn’t be satisfied unless
they won.”

Pitt started off the weekend on
the right note by defeating Edinboro
7-1 Friday night.

With starting defenseman Matt
White out of the lineup with a severe
ankle sprain and the first line being
played sparingly, the third and fourth
lines got all the ice time they needed
to defeat Edinboro.

“It was a good chance to get the
third and fourth line players a lot of
experience for the future,” Niedt
said.

Starting in net for Pitt was Dan
Ciarletta, and finishing was Ian
Lebwohl who made 17 saves, com-
bined. Ciarletta and Lebwohl got
some help from their defense, who
allowed only 18 shots, and by the
offense, who posted 49 shots against
Edinboro’s Mark Maksin.

Opening the scoring was Pitt’s
Matt Danzuso giving the Panther’s a
quick 1-0 lead. Danzuso’s goal set
the tone of the game. A tone that con-
sisted of Pitt scoring and Edinboro
struggling.

By the end of the first period,
Pitt had a 3-0 lead on goals from
Elliott and Muffi.

Although there wasn’t much
scoring in the second, the one lonely
goal was scored by .Pitt’s Elliott with
7:16 left in the period.

Midway through the third period,
Pitt increased its lead to 5-0 on a
goal by Wills. Fourteen seconds
later, Wally Sheide scored making it
6-0.

With five minutes remaining,
Elliott got his third goal of the game
(second unassisted) putting the final

Panthers are fire on ice

Three-win weekend preps Panthers for playoffs

touches on a Panther victory.

Before it was all said and done,
Edinboro would get on the score-
board. Chris Turns scored, posting
the only Edinboro goal and making
the final score 7-1.

Saturday night, Robert Morris
once again proved to be a problem
for the Panthers.

Despite taking an early 1-0 on a
goal by Baron, Pitt was struggling to
hold off the Colonial’s attack.

It didn’t take Robert Morris long
to tie the game as Joe Lacko scored a
minute later.

Before the end of the first period,
Robert Morris would find the net
again. This time John Castracone
scored giving Robert Morris a 2-1
lead.

Knotting the score three minutes
into the second period was Pitt’s
Matt Kerec. But, a minute later, the
Colonials once again took the lead
on a Joe Rittler goal.

Four minutes later, Girvin scored
tying the game 3-3. Pitt had no time
to enjoy the luxury of a tie hockey
game because less than 50 seconds
later, Mike Hughes scored giving
Robert Morris the lead once again.

Following the flip-flop scoring
pattern that developed, Pitt’s Ryan
Moore scored with 4:55 left in the
second tying the game.

Four minutes into the third,
Elliott found the net for the first time
that night to put Pitt up 5-4.

Three minutes later, Moore
scored increasing the Panther lead to
two at 6-4. But, Robert Morris
refused to quit. With 4:12 left in the
game, Castracone scored his second
of the game to pull the Colonials
within one.

With just under a minute left in
regulation, Robert Morris pulled its
goaltender in hopes of tying the
game. With a flurry of activity in
front of Pitt’s net and a lapse in
defense due to a line change, goalie
Patrick Kenny was forced to make a
series a saves to prevent the tie.

“We got caught on the change;
we were tired. They got some fresh
guys out there,” Niedt said. “Kenny
stoned them; he didn’t let anything
u 

p Kenny came up big with the save
despite being screened.

“I did a split and blocked it with
my leg,” Kenny said of his save with
15 seconds remaining. “I never saw
the shot. All I did was feel it.”

Time expired on the Colonials
and they dropped their second game
in two weeks to Pitt, this time by a 6-

5 score.

In Sunday’s game, Allegheny

“This was the best performance

Column 

to the Miami Heat in exchange for Sasha
Danilovic, Kurt Thomas, and Martin
Muursepp. Mash said he felt like a rook-
ie when he ﬁrst got to Miami, it was a
brand new start. As for Sasha and the
gang, they have to be happier than dirt to
go from a team that is currently in second
place in the eastern Conference behind
Chicago to a Mavericks team that is 17-
32 and going nowhere.

Nelson said that he wanted to get rid
of the players who he felt didn’t want to
play in Dallas and now, with Shawn

Bradley, Robert Pack, Ed O’Bannon and

Khalid Reeves fresh off the plane from
Newark I’m sure he has a new ban of
merry men that will turn the franchise
around. Right?

Why would anyone want to play in
Dallas? Playing for the Mavericks has
about as much job security as an exotic
dancer in the Vatican City.

At the end of last season Dallas had
13 players on their roster. They showed
signs of promise during the ‘95—’96 year
even though they didn’t live up to the
huge billing they were getting around the
league. Of those 13 players, not one is
still playing in Reunion Arena.

Not Tony Dumas, who’s now in
Phoenix. Not Lucious Harris, who’s with
the lowly Sixers now. Not even the
Cherokee Nation, now a Timberwolf.

 

FROM PAGE 13 

A facelift like this doesn’t just hap-
pen when a new coach comes in and it
certainly shouldn’t happen with the
appointment of a new General Manager,
no matter who he is.

The Mavericks are a lousy team,
playing in a lousy arena, in an even
worse market for professional basketball.
The Houston Rockets are the lone Texas
team with its head above water and they
can thank their masterrninds in the front
office for nabbing the Glyde and Sir
Charles in the past two years to help
Hakeem.

Another sickening factoid from
Maverick headquarters: the player who
has the longest current tenure with the
team is rookie Samaki Walker.

Maybe the Mavs are playing for the
most balls in April’s lottery. Maybe
they’re itching for a move out of Dallas.
Maybe its new head coach Jim
Cleamons, who has been openly reamed
by Mashbum, Jimmy Jackson and prob-
ably even Sue Ellen.

Fact is, the Mavericks are a franchise
that’s going nowhere fast.

Real fast.

News and feels conﬁdent that he could
knock down a couple threes for the Mavs
if given the chance

 

Vienna Woods displays uniq

Tales from the Vienna Woods
Pitt Theatre
Directed by David Pellegrini

David Pellegrini’s shows’ usually take
on a thematic element that transcends real-
istic conventions, like the futuristic frenzy
of “Enrico IV,” or dabbling in Buddhism,
Magritte—induced surrealism, cultural collu-
sion, and God knows what else, as in “King
Lear.” My perspective on Pellegrini may be
charged with a bit of bias since I have open-
ly admitted my work with him; however
(without getting into an examination of the
death of the author/reader/pretentious mas-
turbatory theatre reviewer), in keeping with
the “new joumalism" of the day, orientation
and bias are always present in everyone’s
thinking and writing; it is perhaps better to
deal with and confront them rather than try
to hide them.

Pellegrini’s current production,the ﬁrst
Pitt mainstage of the semester, Odon von
Horvath’s “Tales from the Vienna Woods,”
displays a decidedly naturalistic element,
which is not a major digression from the
Pellegrini world of dramatic vision, but
rather a measure of respect for the text that
cannot be taken, or transcended, into any-
thing other than what is written.

Odon Von Horvath was an Austro-
Hungarian writer and was a contemporary
of Brecht’s until a fateful accident in Paris
where he died under a ﬂash of lightning.
Like Brecht, he was interested in fascism

and Germany and women, but unlike him
he used Viennese traditions like music,
magical happenings, and aspects of the
Viennese culture to illuminate a story.
“Tales from the Vienna Woods” is a
story about love and life and all that follows
in the context of 1930s Vienna. Alfred (Jeff
Detweiler) is an irnpetuous badboy type

Rachel Wynn   Detwei show us how feels in Pe|rini’s production.

who is infatuated with fast money and
beautiful women. He is locked into a rela-
tionship with Valerie (Margot VVistar Lipp)
but is swept away by the beauty of
Marianne (Rachel Wyim).

Marianne and Alfred share and feel the
pulse of attraction and love, but of course,
Mariarme is already engaged to Oskar

 

 

(Emilio Robles). In a move filled with bold
spontaneity, Mariarme breaks Oskar’s heart
and decides to move in with the badboy,
Alfred. Life falls upon the two lovers as
they see passion evaporate into hatred and
mutual discontent. The show then contin-
ues as any other story about the human con-
dition and then, Whaml, the audience is hit
with a cabaret sequence, jabbed with some
songs and dances, and thoroughly slapped
with a seductive medley of everything that
could be placed into an “artistic under—
groun .”

Marianne ﬁnds a way out of her dol-
drums, and the lives of Alfred, Oskar, her
father, Zamberkonig (Tim Johnson), and
Alfred’s mother and grandmother(Jess

,Milspaw and Sue Galloway) all come

together to give images of human life that
made me reﬂect, and at the very least, made
me smile. What probably made me smile
the most was seeing Jeff Detvveiler in a
bathing suit.

Meanwhile, Alfred’s old ﬂame,
Valerie, has displayed some romantic inter-
est for Erich (Brian Gill), a student studying
to be an industrial lawyer. Valerie spends
some time “helping him shoot,” but in the
end, as always, things and people come
back together, in the least, to make sense.

The show’s realism was sensitive to
itself and to its audience in making what
seemed to be a rather relaxed, detached per-
formance that didn’t try to overestimate its

THE DEAD DECADE: Roadhouse, we hardly knew ye

Less than a year after it
opened as the second (and more
worthy) successor to the world
famous Decade, Tobacco
Roadhouse, Oakland’s only rock
n’ roll dive*, is closed. Reopening
Friday in a new, yet untried incar-
nation as an Alternative Lifestyles
establishment called the Frog
Pond, we can safely assume that
the days of wine and roses are
over.

The Roadhouse, or “The
Decade”, as it was known to many
an aged punk rawker, brains
numbed from years of cheap beer
and stale drugs, was a dinosaur
surviving in the Mad Mex age.
T.R. was the only remaining venue
in Oakland where one could expe-
rience raw, festering rock and roll

in a true-to-life, wet bar, drip-
dick, snap—tit, urinal »
setting with leather on
the coat
hangers and
dead people
under the stage. It
was charming
in a Stalag
13 kind of way; all of
its patrons were actu-
ally POWS, watch-
ing life from under
their bald spots, mohawks, or
neckwarmer hockey helmets and
seeing nothing that interested them
all that much.

Tobacco Roadhouse was not
the kind of place where one could
buy a cigar for show, like the new
martinis-are-for-lovers lounges of

  
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
  

the moment, but
where one could
' actually smoke it. I
certainly was there
more than some, and
much less than

many others,
and I will be sad to
let it go.

Whither Rickety
Tuesday?, the once a week
showcase for the oral-compul-
sive, geriatric mudwrestler music
spat out by such unlistenable,
unlikable, yet loveable local
untouchables like Dead at 24, Tiny
Little Help, and the Johnsons?
Where will they go, where will
they go 

’ What will become of the once

a year Misﬁts tribute on
Halloween? The night when local
pop luminariesfmd hair they did-
n’t know they had and pull it in
front of their faces with mad
styling tools, then scream like ban-
shee baseball bat brats on stage in
front of hundreds of adoring, spit-
ting fans —— where now, fair
Astrozombies?

The Frog Pond is, allegedly,
planning to tear down the stage of
the Roadhouse/Decade and hav-
ing a dance ﬂoor, with DJ ’d music,
but if they did have bands, would
someone like Creeps, one of the
most wonderfully horrible shit-
purik-metal bands I’ve seen, be
allowed to play there? I doubt it.
And what will happen to that
sweet old smelly guy" who was in

 

there every day at 5:30 — will he,
and his ﬁne Canadian haircut, be
welcome to go comatose from IC
Light in the Frog Pond? We can
hope.

What we are witnessing,
friends, is the beginning of a peri-
od of Oakland history, mirroring
American current trends, called
the Decade Diaspora. Unable to
hold down a particular bar for
long, the Decaders, that mix of
punks, fellas, old—timers, blues-
men, rudeboys, hard drinkin’ gays,
and Rickety-folk, will wander the
Earth of Oakland by night, looking
to suck the blood of bad bar bands
and bite deep into a longneck.
Uncle J irnmy’s seems a good pos-
sibility, or Denny’s, for proximity,

Pavement
Brighten the Corners
Matadorl Capitol

Pavement, lovely and lackadaisi-
cal, gives a moody feeling where all
is forgiven. Give up the day; blow it
off. Sit in your basement. Why wait
and let it slowly retard you toward
sleep? Your life is on layaway, never
to be purchased in full, because you
keep doling yourself out day after
day.

The weather is important, more
than you know. Weather affects
behavior. May as well let it. No
longer trained to perform, you
become swayed by the sun, the filthy
fog, and the swirling snow. “The
shores don't stay blonde all year.”
Look out the window at home, at
work, at school. An icy sheet covers
buildings and trees, cars, and even
people. Everything moves slowly.
People in the streets are careful not to
slip. Drivers are wary of each other.
You hunch over as you walk with
your hands in your pockets, digging
your chin in to your coat collar.

“Spells have been cast, and the
urge has been last.” So you really
should wander sometimes. Forget
about fences. Fences are for cattle.
The Lone Ranger never cared about
anyone’s fences. “Hi ho Silver,
away.” Hop that fence, and run to the

pool. Make it happen. You can swim
if you want. Float around, arch your
back; it’s easy. You can’t tell how
deep the water is, but it doesn’t mat—
ter. You could check. somehow, turn
yourself over, try to touch bottom
with one leg, and discover that you’re
safe or that you’re in way over your
head. Now you’ve disrupted every-
thing. You freak out and need securi-
ty. You cling to direction — paying
your bills on time, an honest day’s
work. You’re no longer ﬂoating,
which was easy in the first place.
Jealousy gets the best of you. You
think everything sucks. Assholes start
making sense. Misery loves company,
you know.

So maybe a long afternoon alone
listening to your favorite music isn’t
such a bad idea. Go ahead, blow
everything off for one day. While
you’re at it, check out the new
Pavement LP, Brighten the Corners.
It’s better than the last one, Wowee
Zowee, and might even be as good as

the Watery, Domestic ep. Maybe this

is a return to the Pavement of old.
Some of the changes catch you by
surprise, like the jump in to the cho-
rus on the first track “Stereo.” Some
of the songs are predictable, maybe
even boring. But they’re all so darn
catchy, which we can always expect
from Pavement.

capabilities as a company. The acting was
primarily natural and solid, which turned
into a meaningful show that usually drew
me into the world that was created.
Without attempting to do everything
(which happens often), the cast managed
to let the text do the talking and played the
script for what it was — a story about
love, faith, and guys in dorky bathing
suits.

The cast of 21 was solid and disci-
plined as it presented an entertaining story
and, for the most part, made me believe
what was happening. Margot Wistar Lipp
was particularly engaging as Valerie; she
drew me into her story every step of the
way and never let me forget who she was.
She managed to create a rather exciting
dynamic with Jeff ‘ Detweiler’s Alfred,
who, as I alluded to earlier, is quite a sight
in a bathing suit. Tim Johnson’s
Zamberkonig was also quite a sight; his
performance was strong and much like
Detweiler. I just couldn’t get over the
sight of him in a bathing suit. I enjoyed
Emilio Robles’ befuddled Oskar along
with Brian Hil1’s young and tough Erich
(after he mentioned The Brothers
Karamazov, I couldn’t help but love him).
Andrew Paul was ridiculously funny as
Havilitschek, Oskar’s butcher friend. If
he didn’t have a hooker on his knee, he
was either chasing a woman around or
teﬂing Oskar how to treat ‘em. Sue
Galloway was fantastic as the cantanker-
ous grandmother; I couldn’t wait for her
to come back every time she left the

stage. By simply looking into her eyes,
one can intimately feel her presence.
Dave Mansueto, who has a striking
resemblance to Norm MacDonald, was
“enchanting” as the Captain, and Justin
LaPilusa certainly caught my attention as
the American, although I think he could
have brought his screams down a notch.

The cabaret sequences were enter-
taining, and the entire group of cabaret
actors kept me interested, but I must say
that it could have been cut down a little
bit. Just a bit. As entertaining as attractive
women dancing and singing are, after
Chris Rath’s CK 1 dance sequence, it
seemed to get a bit stale. '

Overall, the show was entertaining
and fun and portrayed some interesting
situations about love and life and all that
follows. Pellegrini makes some bold
departures from his usual directing style,
but succeeds in creating a theatrical world
that is sensitive to and draws in its audi-
ence. If nothing else, this show provides
the opportunity to see Jeff Detweiler in a
bathing suit, which should be more than
enough motivation to go.

Tales from the Vienna Woods is
playing tonight thru Sunday Feb. 23, at
the Studio Theatre, basement of the
Cathedral of Leaming. Show times are 8
p.m, Thursday thru Saturday with a 2
p.m matinee on Sunday. Tickets are $10,

or perhaps an unlikely choice, like the Attic.
Only two things are certain in these boat-
, rocking times: '

1) Live music is obviously no money-
maker. People don’t care for it, and I don’t
care for them. »

2) There’s gonna be a LOT of people look-

The Tobacco Roadhouse was the last
place in the area where one could afford to
go hear bands play without knowing what
one was getting into. I heard several bands
there, from Rockabilly legend Ronnie
Dawson, to R&B swingers the Rocket 88’s,
thatl could not have seen anywhere else, nor
would I want to. The Ghost Town of
Oakland is becoming more so, with the
demise of Atwood’s music Mecca; their
jukebox alone was better than most
Pittsburgh live venues.

So, if you have a basement and live in
Oakland, buy a keg and get 10 bands to play
there for a dollar. You’ll be glad you did it.
And, if you see Ajax or Carrie, the
Roadhouse’s favorite employee/patrons,
walking the streets, minds a-tattered, buy
"em each a draft. I’ll pay ya back.

Hamlet
Directed by Kenneth Brannagh

Starring Kenneth Brannagh Kate ,

Winslet Derek Jacobi

Despite Hollywood’s recent
interest in the Western Canon (i.e.
The Scarlett Letter, Portrait of a
Lady, In Loveland War, etc.) there is
at least one _director who manages to
make the action fit the word and rise
far above these other novels for the
screen. Kenneth Brannagh has done
plenty of Shakespeare before and the
ease with which he portrays the
melancholy Prince of Denmark is
everything it should be. Switching
effortlessly from diabolical to sar-
castic to depressed, Brannagh puts
all other attempts at Hamlet to
shame.

Granted, four hours is quite a
commitment, but with the extortion-
ate prices of movies these days, isn’t
it worth it? Because this is film, as
opposed to stage theatre, Brannagh
has taken the opportunity to fill in
some blanks for us. Through the use
of ﬂashbacks, we actually get to see

I am a ninja

Claudius kill the king. We also get
some much—needed love scenes
between Hamlet and Ophelia, which
help to make Ophelia’s madness
much more understandable and
believable. This is the only time I’ve
ever seen or heard of a director actu-
ally putting emphasis on Hamlet and
Ophelia’s affair.

Unlike Mel Gibson’s laughable
attempt at Shakespeare, Brannagh
has also left the subtle homoerotic
scenes intact. Audiences will also not
be forced to endure any of the

painfully obvious Oedipal love
scenes between Gertrude and
Hamlet. Let us not forget that

Shakespeare thought of everything
when he wrote this play and thanks
to Robin Williams and Billy Crystal
the comic scenes are perfectly done.
In short, this is arguably the
greatest play ever written, and if dur-
ing the film you feel at all dissatis-
fied, lost, angry, depressed, bored,
thwarted, confused, or clueless then
you’re understanding at least half of

what Shakespeare intended.
——e.m. seifert
