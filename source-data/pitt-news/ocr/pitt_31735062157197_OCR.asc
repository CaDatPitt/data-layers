. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! This is it .
; ‘ning for two fun-ﬁlled nights at Ellsworth Center, May 4 and 5,

'/48 Carniva Opens
Tonight at Ellsworth

. the Spring Carnival run-

and featuring His Royal Majesty, the mysterious King T—Tip. -
The Carnival will have all the color and excitement of a cir-

cus coming toga small town. It opens with the gala ﬂoat parade,

which will wend its way through Oakland‘ this afternoon and end

at Ellsworth Center.
There are two‘ reasons for the

5 Carnival running an extra day
 this year. First there are so many

things to do, nobody could possib-

-ly crowd all the fun into one
' night.

In addition to free ﬁreworks

. and the King T-Tip show, there
: are 43 booths,

including seven
shows, sponsored by the various

it Pitt organizations. This is deﬁnite-A
’ ly the biggest and imost fun-pack-
‘ ed carnival ever to hit Pitt.

The second reason for running

; the Carnival two nights is just a
_ bit mercenary. With the Vets all

"getting their raise this month they
' will have an extra bob or two to

give to all those deserving insti-
tutions———frats, sororities and inde-
pendent associations on the Pitt
campus. . ~

The ﬁreworks display will begin
at approximately 10:15 p. m., af-
ter most of the activity on the

.Midway has quieted down.

All 43 of the booths. will be in
continuous operation Tuesday af-
ternoon and evening and all Wed-
nesday evening-. There will be
games ofchance (roulette wheels,

( chuck-a-luck, etc.) for those stu-

dents who have been anxiously

‘' awaiting the day when they could
« have a chance to break the bank.
» ,In addition, there will be fortune

telling booths in fact, any kind of
booth you might want.

" Of course, the feature attrac-
tion of both nights will be the
King T—Tip show. The lucky win-
ner of this contest will receive a
free night at the Club Cop/a.

The contest will be run at the
end of the evening. The person
with the lucky number will be
called to the stage and if he can
identify King T-Tip from the clues
presented, he gets all the prizes.

Heralded after a highly success-
ful tour as the ﬁnest in Pitt’-s
history, the Concert Band makes
its campus bow to a Spring Fes-
tival audience this evening at 8:30
p. m. in Soldiers and Sailors Me-

, morial auditorium.

Campus music fans have the

; opportunity of hearing the same

varied program that left the aud-
lences spel1—bound during the
three—day tour.

With complete instrumentation,
Conductor Robert L. Arthur’s 65-
piece band will run through a
repertory of classical and popular
tunes.

Tickets for tonight‘s concert

E ‘ may be, purchased from any band

member, at the student desk, or
at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.

For Parade This Aflernoon

Today is parade day! At 1:30 this afternoon, more than 20 ﬂoats
will assemble at Fifth and Tennyson avenues for the annual Spring

Festival ﬂoat parade.

The parade will get underway
promptly at 2 p. m. and takes
the following route:

The trucks bearing the ﬂoats
will move from the assembly point
to Fifth and Belleﬁeld. From there
the cavalcade will move past the
judge's stand which will be set up
in front of the YMHA 0n‘Belle-
ﬁeld and will turn "left on Auc-
nuc St. to Forbes.

Turning left on Forbes St. the

parade will be met by police-who

will escort them to Morewood
Place, and from there the pa-
rade will go down Morewood to
Ellsworth Center. At this point, it
will disband and the two day car-
nival will be officially ‘opened.

The judges this year will be
Pittsburgh’s Mayor, The. Honor-
able David L’. Lawrence, Evelyn
Gardner, a well—known ﬁgure on
Pittsburgh air waves, Mr. Reid
Hastie of the Fine Arts Depart-
ment at Pitt, and Mr. Charles Le-
Clair of the Art Department at
Pennsylvania College for Women.
“These persons,” Chairman Ka-
tie Gaskin says, “were chosen by
the Float Parade Committee.”

Sororities have‘ been instructed
to place their chosen numbers on
the trucks instead of their indiv-
idual sorority names until after
they have passed the judges’
stand, to aid the judges in desig-
nating winning ﬂoats.

The awards for the winners will
be presented at the Grand Ball at
Ches-Arena on a Friday night.

A week and a half has expired since an
editorial entitled “No Tags Now” appeared
in this column. Much comment, pro and. con,
has been bruited about since then on the News’
antagonistic stand.

Strong point of the opposing comment came
from the quarters that planned the “parking
plaza” here last year. They contend that Pitt
V students are “in for it” regardless of the op-
inions expressed because the Pittsburgh Traf-
fic,Planning Department made the agreement.

In view of this, the Pitt News openly re-
tracts nothing but urges the student to re-
.member that his car will be hemmed-in after

 

‘ 12 :30 p. m. on the follpwing days: Wednesday,.

May 5; Thursday, May 6; Wednesday, May 12;
and Wednesday, June 3. ll
Our reasons for not retracting any state,-

" ments is the fact that no solution to the park-

ing problem has been made.‘ We feel, at least,
that the solution to parking problems around
campus falls far short of even cursory satis-
faction. As long as daily reports that students,
parking three and a half blocks from the Cath-

edral, must shell out two dollars (in some
cases, 15 dollars) for a parking ticket, no ade-
quate solution has been found.

- However, since only four games remain on
the Forbes Field schedule that might interfere
with the student parking, The Pitt News asks
that those driving consult their calendars be-
fore leaving cars in the plaza. They might also
consider that their car will hold a parking
ticket if it is located behind the scoreboard or
in front of the fountain on the days of games.

Entertainment lnelux

It’s yours, almost for the asking, Spring
Festival fun, that is. Starting wtih the rally
held‘ yesterday and continuin'g‘through to-
day ’s events and those of the rest of the week
everything has been planned by the committee
toward maximum enjoyment at minimum cost.

The Float Parade today, we are assured,
will feature, among other things, girls. Gentle-
men, your staring todaywill not only be tol-
-erated, will not only meet with social approval,
but will be standard operating procedure for
the event. (Women are also welcomed as spec-
tators along the line of march.)

Tonight, a great concert by a great band
will cater to the“ music lovers among you, while
the more extroverted will ﬁnd the Carnival at
Ellsworth Center ﬁeld their element. Tomorrow,
the Tea Dance and more Carnival; Thurs-
day the Pitt Players wil hold forth. And so
it goes, right on through to the closing of the
curtains at the Players’ show on Saturday
night. And it’s yours, every bit of it.

This week is your week here at Pitt; this’

Festival is your ,festival. Make it a success———
have fun. ’

Student Union

 - As’ Memorial

By Bill Veenis

Last Friday afternoon, a group of prominent
Pittsburghers, and more particularly, prominent
Pitt Alumni, met around a luncheon table to dis-
cuss the possibilities of a Pitt memorial to Jock
Sutherland. . C

The men involved have kept close contact

with Pitt during their years with the sheep-

skins. They have a speciﬁc feeling of loyalty to

the school. One man expressed it this way:

“I may dislike the presentway of doing things

out there, but Pitt is still my Alma Mater.”

With this in mind,Vthe men around the luncheon
.table started to move on one of the most import-
ant projects on this campus since the building of
the Cathedral. This, too, involves building. And.
it involves, the first expression of true sentiment
I have been privileged to see on this campus.

The men around the table called for a _me-
morial to Dr. John B. Sutherland. They call-
ed for if as interested alumni and friends of
the late Scot. They called for the building of
a student union memorial—-something that will
be seen and utilized by everyone interested
in Pitt. Under present building plans, this:
means that the basketball fan, the studgnt,
the faculty member, the alumnus would bene-
ﬁt.

The building of a student-union memorial
means that the memory of Jock Sutherland would
beneﬁt, too. As the men around the table ex-
pressed it, the Silent Scot was more interested in
building men than in building football teams. His
many close friends bear this out. They say that
he spent more time‘ with the personal problems
of his ballplayers than with the tactical problems
on the gridiron. He was a mastermind at both.

This student-union idea, although old on this
campus, is the ideal answer to perpetuate the work
of the great Sutherland. Its purpose is to build
character, and, with the plan of a basketball pales-
tra, to build men. Dr. Sutherland would be happy
to know that the men who are his friends have
this in mind. '

Daily and weekly writers exert a"

But why must representatives
of both sides continue a war of
condemnation? In every dispute,
conciliation is the best solution.
Editors and educators alike are
noted for their supposed far-

maintain that his system is best——
why not compromise for the good
of both?

True, a ﬂedgling ‘newsman or

but any contact with the rudi-

be worth something. Besides, the

We think the idea, if not novel,

is at least interesting in its specu-

lative aspects. Consider with us

for a moment to what heights this

sort of thing could lead.

Let us, in the manner of sta-

tisticians, take a hypothetical case.

Suppose, just entering the Cathed-

ral on your way to an evening

class, you should ﬂash that smile

and “hello” to a slightly beat

chick just beginning her, home-

ward trek. At home said chick

smiles ingratiatingly at her moth-

er and squeezes out words to this

effect, “The cutest fellow said,

-‘hello,’ to meat school today. He

was really a gone boy, but gone.”

(This, of course, presumes a lot

on your part, but we won’t quib-

ble over details.)

Mom immediately radiates all
over the place to think that her
little girl is so popular at the Uni-

versity. She. prepares Dad’s fav-
orite dinner and welcomes him
home from the office with much
ado. Dad eats long and heartily,
falls smilingly asleep, and arises
the next morning with a- distinct-

NEW YORK, N. Y.-—(ACP)——
An experimental ﬁve-year pro-
gram to develop four permanent
university study centers in Latin
America, carried out jointly by
the University of North Carolina,
the University of Texas, Tulane
University and Vanderbilt Uni-

versity, is now well advanced at
these institutions, according to an
announcement by the Carnegie
Foundation for the advancement
of teaching.

Vanderbilt will establish an in-

C stitute of South American studies,

emphasizing Brazil; Tulane will
carry on a Middle American pro-

' gram; North Carolina will focus

on area studies of Spanish South
America; and Texas will em-
_phasize Mexico.

Designed to make ‘available

comprehensive knowledge of Lat- -

in-America to students, teachers,
businessmen and government of-
ficials, the program will provide
in each center a strengthened un-
dergraduate curriculum, broader
facilities for graduate work and
an expansion of library resources.

More than 65 per cent of high
school boys and 62 per cent of the
girls are in. favor of compulsory
military training for all boys be-
tween the ages of 16 and 21, ac-
cording to the latest Institute of
Student Opinion poll conducted by
Scholastic magazines.

Saturday at 8:310 p.m. in Foster
Memorial.

Starring Murray Harris, stand-
out performer of “Mabel’s Fable,”
the play will be staged as much as
possible like the original 17th
Century comedy. When the great
French wit’s dialogue isn’t draw-
ing chuckles, the affected gestures
and mannerisms of the Restora-
tion theater will.

L a m p o o n i n g a middle-class
Frenchman’s aspirations to the no-
bility, the play follows the antics
of Monsieur Jourdain (Harris) as
he attempts to learn dancing, sing-
ing, fencing, philosophy, and oth-
er of the nobler arts in an attempt
to impress a marquise, played by
Ruth Scwartz. The fact that Jour-
dain already has a wife‘ (Cecelia
Bodman) and a grown daughter
(Lenore Pinsker) only adds to the
hilarity.

The play’s climax comes in the
third act when J ourdain is made a
‘mamamouchi’ in a mock Turkish

‘ ceremony, complete with dancing

girls in ﬂimsy costumes and a
chorus and entourage of loin-
clothed Turks.

Other principals are Irving
Sandson,»as Dorante, the no-
ble ‘patron’ of Jourdain; Ed Ra-
dasky as Cleonte, admirer of his
daughter; Richard Swierczyk as
Covielle, Cleonte’s foxy servant;
and Anatile Gefsky as Nicole,
Mme Jourdain’s maid.

Double parts are taken by Bill
Bode, who plays the Philosophy
teacher and the Turkish mufti;
Louis Vonderheid as the Music
Master and a Turkish drummer,
and Howard Karp, doubling as the
Dancing Master and the second
drummer.

Two musical interludes are_pro—
vided by Dick Kovar as the Singer
and Hunter McGeary as the Mu-
sician, accompanied by Lois Em-
mel.

Tickets for the show are $1 for
all seats, or 75 cents on the Spring
Festival strip ticket.

lJoub|eday's Ken McCormick
Talks to Writers Next Week

Ken McCormick, editor-in-chief of Doubleday and Co., Inc,
the largest publishing house in the world, will share speaking honors
with ﬁve other personalities prominent in the several literary. pro-
fessions at the third annual Western Pennsylvania Conference for
Writers, scheduled for May 13 and 14 in Stephen Foster Memorial.

Representatives of 25 district colleges have been invited to the
Conference which also will occasion the sale of “MSS,” the maga-
zine of the best in student creative writing at Pitt.

Editor-in Chief at Doubleday since 1942, McCormick entered
the publishing side of literary life after convincing himself that
he was not a writer.

Appearing at the Conference along with McCormick will be
Jesse Stuart, the Kentucky poet and author; Betty Finnin, ﬁction edi-
tor of “Woman’s Day” magazine,‘ Professor Norman Foerster of the
University of North Carolina;
Dean Kenneth Olson of the Medill
School of Journalism at North-
western University; and Professor
at Large Percival Hunt, Pitt’s na-
tionally known teacher of descrip-
tive and narrative writing.

After a Methodist parsonage
childhood and with a degree from
Williamette University in Salem,
Oregon, McCormick hitch—hiked
to New York and took six part-
time jobs so that he might have
time to write.

Having written three unsale-
able novels and hundreds of short
stories that rated only rejection
slips in two years, he took a jo-b
with ‘Doubleday Bookshops ‘in
1930.

Leaving the company only for
a two year stint in the Army_Air
Force from 1943 to 1945, the
thwarted writer moved from the
sales force to the position of pro-
motion manager before transfer-
ring to the editorial department.
He worked up from reader to as-
sociate editor to editor and final-
ly, in 1942, to editor-in-chief.

“That’s iGround Hog Day here,”
she said, “but in France it is Pan-
cake Day. Everybody fries a pan-
cake, holding the griddle in one
hand and a coin in the other. If
you ﬂip the pancake and catch it
right, you will be rich all year.”
Another way to be rich, French
people think, is to go to America.
“All my friends will expect me
to be very wealthy when I re-
turn. They think anyone from
America must be a millionaire,”
she laughed. ~
“They put me In tenth grade at
Mt. Lebanon High school,” she re-
lates. “There I was, knowing only
the English I learned in sixth
grade in Paris, put into a class
with big girls who wore make-up.
They ﬁnally put me back where
‘I belonged, and I graduated in
1945. By that time I knew more
than the “Oh, look at the moon”
poem I learned in France.”
Helene entered Pitt in Septem-
ber of the same year, and was re-

’ cruited as a conversationalist by

Dr.  H. Shelton, head of the
modern languages department, the

  oungFrenc  
Goes HometoParis

*When Pitt’s youngest faculty member, Helene Ragner, returns
to her Paris home this week, she’ll probably be able_to say more
than “Oh, look at the moon” to any Americans she meets there.

After spending the last eight years away from home, Helene
(she pronounces it “Ay-lenn”) packed her ‘bags last week and said
goodby to her friends at Pitt, where she served two years as a con-
versationalist in the French classes. ' -

Only 20, she readily gave here

following Spring. At 18, she was
probably one of the youngest
members of the faculty ever to
teach at Pitt.

When she said goodby to Dr.
Shelton last week, there were tears
in her eyes, but she laughed them
away when she was asked what
she would do when she got to
France.

“Oh,«my cousins will be there,
and I will kiss them all, three
times on each cheek. That’s the
way you have to do in France,
even if you don’t like them.

“I’ll have such a hard time,
though. Eight years! I Won’t know
any of their slang," only such silly
American words as ‘Honey.’ It’s
such a sticky substance. What a
compliment to pay a girl! And
‘wolf’. A wolf is something that
stays away from humanity. I never
saw a wolf like that here!”

With these charming remarks,
Mlle. Ragner smiled her way
through her crowd of friends,
promising that she would try to
stop in Pittsburgh this fall when
she comes back to study at Ober-
lin college.

“Pitt-in—China,” ’on
charitable organizations aided by
the Pitt Chest, is your instru-
ment for raising the morale of
fellow students at the university
of Lingnan, a devastated campus
in China.

Seven years an exile in the Chi-
nese hills, the university has at
last moved back to its original
campus at Canton, China.

With the threat of the J ap invad'
ers gone, the campus is once again
teeming with students and activi-
ty. But the comparison between
Lmgnan and Pitt is sadly depress-
ing. * '

Pitt with its moderately crowd-
ed classes can hardlybe compar-
ed with Lingnan where the‘ stu-
dents stand in lines along the
walls ‘of the class rooms.

Twenty students wait in the
laboratories to use the one avail-
able microscope. They walk
through rice ﬁelds instead of the
green-grassed campuses Pitt stu-
dents are used to, and gain their
exercise by rebuilding the devas-
tation of war.

Yale Sc.enﬁs+
Hits Modern

Specialization

The greatest menace to educa-
tion is the student who over—spec-
ializes in one ﬁeld, Dr. Edmund
W. Sinnott, head of Yale’s divi-
sion of sciences, stated in an ar-
ticle in the Christian Science Mon-
itor.

“The man whose interests are so
narrow that he specializes on the
left leg of the Paleozoic cockroach
is too lopsided mentally to be able

complex world,’’ Dr. Sinnot said.

He believes that this is the day
of natural science, and that in
order to face the problems of the
modern world, citizens in a dem-
ocracy must know more about na-
tural science than most of them
now do—-not only more facts
about it, but more about its meth-
ods, possibilities, and limitations.

There is no room for scientiﬁc

to cope with the problems of our '

illiterates in modern society, Dr.

science has placed at our disposal
tend to make us a nation of but-
ton-pushers, to have what is call-
ed the “chauffer mind,” able to
manipulate switches and ‘levers,
but know nothing about what

makes them work. '

Paced by Al Jacobs, Kappa Nu
defeated ROTC, 14-9, Friday, at
Ellsworth Field. A home run,
triple, and two singles gave the
Kappa Nu shortstop slugging hon-
ors for the game.

{-5

Jumping oif to an early lead, the
Kaps tallied seven times in the
ﬁrst frame on only four hits.
Jacobs’ home run, winning pitch-
er Dave Hausman’s fourmaster,
two errors, and a walk did the
damage.

Three singles and three walks,
which netted four more runs in
the fourth inning, were enough to
insure ‘victory and send ROTC
twirler Martin Flom from the
mound.

In another game at Ellsworth
Friday, Sigma Chi pounded SAM
pitchers Sol Pearlstein and Mur-

ray love for~18_ hits to waltz to a

20-10 win.

Although Sigma Chi was close
behind in the error column with
six, a pair of home runs by Bill
Kast and consistent hitting by Jim

Rutledge overcame the handicap.

Blocks Snare
One-Hitter

Trees Field, known more recent-
ly as the outﬁeld with many out-
ﬁelds, found only two IM teams to
brave the football weather on
Thursday. Resistance Block, h'elp-
ed materially by John Gruebas’
one-hitter shut out the_Dynamos,
7-0.

The only hit the losers produc-

ed was a sharp ﬁrst inning double .
that shortstop Bernie Williams
whistled by Johnny Marous at
shortstop.

Tom Jones also pitched a one-
hitter, but only until the fourth
when the Blocks teed off on him
for four runs, and added three
more in the ﬁfth.

Carl Mihalik of the Blocks made
a spectacular appearance in the

Contrary to whatever the score
indicates, the Comets and Slip-
sticks did play a IM softball game
Friday at Trees ﬁeld. _

The ﬁnal count, after two hec-
tic hours of playing, ended with
the Comets ahead, 42-21. It is be-
lieved that this 63-run total may
be an IM record.

Going into the struggle unde-
feated the winners blasted a con-
tingent of Slipstick hurlers for
six homers as they scored in ev-
ery inning. Slipstick batters, mean-
while, could "onxy" solve Comet
hurling for three four-baggers.

Red Morrison lead the home
run department with two while
Comet teammates John Haraby,
Bob Seethaler, George Bradel,
and Jim Oberle garnered single
four-masters. On the losers’ side,
Younker, Hermann and DeRemer
connected.

John Bradel, ﬁnal Comet pitch-

in the last four innings to get
credit for the win.

Spring Drills  
Optimistically

(Continued from page 6)
There has been a marked im-
provement in the playing of al-
most every regular on the team
and yet they'll have to ﬁght to]

hold their positions because of the
determination of the subs and
freshmen. ‘

The lone disappointment has
been Bobby Plotz, starting tackle
of last year. Plotz has been get-
ting hurt regularly around the
thighs due to his inability to get
into shape. As a result, freshman
Nick Bulkovic looks like a sure
starter.

Bulkovic, a former Ohio" All-
Statelhigh school tackle, is one of

e reasons that hair is beginning
to grow again on Milligan’s head.
His work‘at the tackle position is
about the best seen around here
for a long time.

Lindy Lauro has been shifted
to left halfback from full. If Lau-
ro’s work in the scrimmages the
past few weeks is any criterion of
his ability next fall, there’ll be
no need to worry about that  ot.

The end combination of lid-
Peak and Skladany have been
around so long that they are al-
most a Pitt tradition. However,
one of them may be benched next
fall if Earl Sumpter, ex-guard,
manages to continue his brilliant
end play.

Others worthy or mention be-
cause of their sterling play are
Centers Don Fisher and Len Rad-
nor, End Mike DeRosa, and Backs
Bill Abraham and Lou Melilo.

Defeat Lions. 4-3. lln Eleventh

Pitt marked up its first win of the baseball season Saturday

morning by edging Penn State, 4-3, in 11 ‘innings.

Coach Ralph Mittenling hopes it is the start of a winning streak
as long as the Panthers’ previous ﬁve—game losing skein;

Pitcher Deryl Calder went the distance for Pitt, allowing six
hits, only one of which was an extra base knock. Bob Gehrett, the
Penn State ace with the butterﬂy wind-up, was the losing pitcher.

The game broke up in the elev-e

enth when Bob Rosfeld, Pitt’s
southpaw ﬁrst baseman, drove a
long single into the left-center-
ﬁeld pocket with the bases loaded.
On Friday, ‘Pitt dropped the
initial game, in the State series,
13-'7. Rudy Hudec, making his first
start for the Panthers, blew up in
the eighth and allowed six runs.

Jim Couch gave the Pitt fans
something to talk about, however,
by blasting out four hits to be-

come the leading Panther bats-

man. The averages:

Couch 26 4 12 .462
Barnes 24 7 10 .417

Golfers Nipped
By Mountaineers

Pitt's improving golfers were
nipped by West Virginia's veteran
linksmen, 5-4, Friday at Morgan-
town for their second one-point
loss in three matches.

The Panthers won three indi-
vidual matches and the Mountain-
eers two, with one tied, but West
Virginia won best ball in two four-
somes and tied the third to take
the match. Mihocko, Baker, Lang-
don, and McBride accounted for
the points credited to Pitt.

 

Saturday softball found the Pitt‘

News nine winning, 7-4, over East

Shep Plays
Main Ball
Friday Eve

’On Friday night, Shep Fields
ripples onto the Ches Arena band
box [or the most traditional dance
in the school year, the Spring Fes-
tival main ball.

Spotlighting the intermsision
will be the nationally famous

‘ Iodernaires.” Perry Como’s
Supper Club combo. Minus Como,
they will harmonize, four strong,
for the dance fans at the ball.

As reported by the Festival com-
mittee, here is the route to the
Ches Arena: Go out Washington
Blvd. to the Highland Park Bridge,
cross, then turn right and proceed
through Aspinwall to Cheswick.
The Ches Arena is on the right
hand. side of the road.

The Ches Arena, with a capaci-
ty of 10,000 people, will be tailor-
ed to hold just 2500 people, thus
avoiding the crowds associated
with last year’s main ball. A max-
imum of 1250 tickets are being
sold for the dance, and the Festi-
val committee emphasizes that no
tickets will be sold at the door.

Tickets are now on sale at the
student booth on the ground floor.
Individual tickets are selling for
$3.25, but are also available on
the specially priced strip-ticket
that is selling for $5. This ticket
admits a student to all,Festival
events. and two people to themain
ball.. A saving of 15% is offered
with these special strip-tickets.

At Tap Day

Ceremonies

Friday’s Tap Day deviates from
the frivolity of the merry-making
over the inevitable arrival of
Spring, by pausing for an hour to
honor the students who are out-
standing examples of achieve-
ments, scholastically and in ac-
tivities.

Senior Queen, the woman chos-
en to represent ‘all that is fine in
Pitt women,’ and Alma Mater, will
be revealed at the ceremonies on
the Cathedral lawn at 10:30 Fri-
day morning.

The ODK awardee, the out-
standing senior man, will be an-
nounced, as will new initiates in-
to Omicron Delta Kappa, men’s
honorary activities fraternity.
Mortar Board, honoring junior
women in activities, will also be
announced.

The Owl Hall of Fame will be
announced on the traditional Fame
book, and Cwens will declare their
new members, selected from the
freshman class.

Publications announcements of
editors and business managers
for 1949, Spring Festival heads for
the 1949 affair, and Most Valu-
able Players Awards to the most
outstanding athletes, made by the
Owl, will round out -the program.

A Tap Day luncheon will be held
immediately after the ceremonies
for all new tappees at the Imperial
Room of Hotel Webster Hall, with
Dean Vincent W. Lanfear as guest
speaker.
