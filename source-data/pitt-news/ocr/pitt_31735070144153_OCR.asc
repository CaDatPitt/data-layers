Student Government Board
member Lacee Ecker ﬁled a com-

plaint to the SGB elections com-
mittee on Tuesday, charging that

A the One Vision One Voice slate

violated two elections codes that
prohibit SGB board and com-
mittee members from endorsing
candidates.

. Code 208.01 states that “the
Student Government Board as a

. whole shall not officially endorse

a candidate  under no circum-
stances should any campaign ma-
terials of any candidate include an
ofﬁcial endorsement of a‘ current
Board member or president.”

The second code states that
“committees of the Student Gov—_
ernment Board shall not endorse
or actively support a candidate.”

SGB governmental relations
committee chair Pete Hammerle
submitted a statement of support
to the One Vision One Voice
Web site.

The statement said, “As a stu-

dent who has held many.leader-‘ '

ship positions throughout my
four years at Pitt, I have come to
understand what it takes to be a
good leader on this campus  I
encourage all of my fellow stu-
dents to make the right choice
on Nov. 20 and vote One Vision
One Voice.”

Pat Moroney, the elections
board chair, said if the elections
committee ﬁnds One Vision One
Voice guilty, they can withhold
the slate’s election deposit or dis-
qualify them from the election-.

“I think the issue is what de-

I ﬁnes a committee chair speaking
in a representative capacity for

their committee,” ‘said Moroney.

On Wednesday, One Vision
One Voice said in a press release
that it disputed the charges.

“Mr. Hammerle made his comment as
an individual committee chairman, not to
represent his full committee,” said the re-
lease.

“Ecker’s claim goes as far as to say he
does, which discredits the voice and work
of the governmental relations committee
as a whole,"

Ecker disagreed.

“Mr. Hammerle has a paid position

from Student Government Board,” said-

Ecker. “His position as the committee
chair is the only recognized position in

He is the spokesperson on behalf of that

Hammerle said that the assistant gov-

said Ecker.

Current board members Amanda Reed
and Nila Devanath form the Students First
slate with Charlie Shull.

Ecker also left a supportive comment
on the Students First Facebook group. She
said she thinks that Facebook groups of
slates do not qualify as official SGB busi-
ness and that Pete Hammerle had released
his statement along with title of govern-
mental relations chair.

Ecker said that her comment on the
Facebook group did not include her title
as SGB member. She said Hammerle was
“using his position to provide credibility
for a quote in support of the candidate.”

One Vision One Voice chose to remove
his title from the Web site after learning

Chabad House mak

by Liz Williamson
- Stzzﬁ’ H7/‘ire/'

Shmuel and Sara Weinstein
spend about $1,000 on groceries
each week — though not to feed
their family of 12. They feed a
family of 100 on Friday nights.

“The family meal is the bread
and butter of Chabad House,”
said Rabbi Shmuel Weinstein, the
director of Chabad House.

When the Weinsteins bought
their North Oakland home 20
years ago, it became the birthplace
of and home to Chabad House,
a Jewish student organization at
Pitt.

Shmuel and Sara Weinstein
now serve as the director and co-
director, respectively.

On the ﬁrst Friday night, one
Pitt student sat at their table.
Now, the Weinsteins stretch their
dining table through the first ﬂoor
of their home to accommodate
up to 150 students from Pitt and
the surrounding universities for
Shabbat dinner, a traditional Jew-
ish Sabbath meal.

“We’re all a family—— a big fam-

 

ily,” said Ari Miller, Pitt student 4
and president of Chabad House.
“It’s a unique experience to be a
part of something that big.”
Distinguishing itself from the

‘,=’*f.. s.
r, -'-. ‘ '
; - 

other Jewish student groups on
campus, Chabad House is an Or-
thodox Jewish group, said Miller,
but the group doesn’t discrimi-
nate.

“We welcome everyone,” Mill-
er said. “We don’t__, care about af-
ﬁliation. We onlyicare that you are
Jewish.” ‘

Many Jewish members bring
friends to Chabad House events.

“Anybody can come,” said
Sara Weinstein. “It is an oppor-
tunity to see what a Jewish life is
like.”

Throughoutthe past 20 years,
Sara Weinstein has noticed a

$20, 000 BUN

growing trend among college stu-
dents to appreciate family values.

“Many students come from‘

divorced families or never had
complete families, and they appre-
ciate it when they ﬁnd it down the
road,” she said. “The world is cra-
zier, and people gravitate toward
family life.” 0 ’
He saw an increase in interest
in Chabad House after the ter-
rorist attacks on Sept. 11. Many

, people turned inward to question

when the attacks occurred, he
said.

“Chabad House offers a venue
to grow, to investigate, to help
sort out the questions,” he said.
When the attacks occurred seven
years ago, Chabad House hung a
sign outside of the William Pitt
Union that read, “Let’s defeat ter-
rorism with acts of kindness.”

Now, Chabad House holds an
armual Sept. 11 Mitzvah Marathon
event at the WPU to remember

the victims. Each student takes a _

picture of a victim and pledges to
perform a simple good deed or

“mitzvah.”

 

Chabad House hosts numerous
other events throughout the year,
such as the fall Welcome Bar-
beque, services during holidays,
speakers and classes. During one
workshop, students make real
shofars, a horn used forJewish re-
ligious purposes and incorporated
in services on Rosh Hashanah
and Yom Kippur. A

This Friday, Chabad House will
host Nonie Darwish, the founder
of Arabs for Israel. A promoter
of peace, Darwish is the daughter
of a deceased Egyptian Army lieu-
tenant general and the founder of
an anti-Israeli terrorist group. She
will tell her story in the Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Union

at noon. The event is free and

open to the public.
However, to support so many

events is ﬁnancially challenging,

said Sara Weinstein.
The group receives funding
from private donations and the

University. Shmuel Weinstein‘ left '

his job as a research scientist at
Westinghouse and now fundraises
full-time for the Chabad House.

“Chabad House is ‘where my
passion is,” said Shmuel Wein-
stein.

However, the Student Gov-

ernment Board recently deferred

funding for the group, now plac-
ing events like Shabbat 1,000 in
jeopardy. _

The goal of Shabbat 1,000 is
to bring together 1,000 people for
a Shabbat dinner. In 2006, 770
students from the surrounding
universities came together for the
event and just more than 1,000 at-
tended in 2007.

Though the possibility of the
feat remains uncertain, the Cha-

ibad House still plans to hold

Shabbat 1,000 inthe spring. ,

However, no matter the ﬁnan-
cial situation, the Chabad House
will never put a price on Shabbat
dinners, said Sara Weinstein.

“It is unbelievable to see how
much happens before your eyes,”
she said. “We celebrate life to-
gether. That’s why we’re here,
that’s. why we livehere and raise
our children here.”

When an inspector reports a violation like a
substandard cooler, the Health Department inter-
venes and helps to resolve the problem as soon as
possible, Zazac said

“If we ﬁnd unsafe conditions, we correct

Melissa Kennedy, the general manager of Pan-

“I understand, even if theyhave to do more or

By law, a restaurant must undergo an inspection
upon renewal of its yeaiiy license

“Itis morelikelythatwewillgo to a fllll-S€1‘ViC€
restaurant within one year than a video rental place
with packaged foods like popcorn,” said Zazac
“The hope is once per year a restaurantwill be in-
spaced”

Restaurants with recurrent violations or service
complaints  more attention

This past year, a few Oakland restaurants re-
quired re-inspection to ensure the facilities had cor-
rected  violations

A health inspector from the county health de-
partment visited one Oakland eatery twice in Sep-
tember. According to a report damd Sept 8, the in-
spector recorded four critical violations: the absence
of a certiﬁed manager, a deﬁcient dishwasher and
an excess of sanitizers in a bucket for  rags
and in the bar sink. Other violations not known to
cause food—borne illnesses included slimy beverage

Come Dec. 1, it is likely that
5 Allegheny County residents who
frely on buses to get from place
1 to place will have to ﬁnd another
 means of transportation.
Local 85, Amalgamated Tran-
? sit Union, the union representing
 Port Authority transit workers,
Esaid a strike is possible starting
Eon Dec. 1 if the Port Author-
iity imposes its own contract on
 union workers. Local 85 and the
lPort Authority have been butt-
ing heads ever since the old labor
contract expired last July. Local
85 has scheduled a meeting Nov.
23 to discuss possibilities in solv-
ing the labor disagreement.
Describing the Port Authority
contract as a lockout, the union
gPresident—Business Agent Pat
 McMahon told the Pittsburgh
 Post_-Gazette that in imposing its
 own contract, “the Port Author-
 ity is taking action that is illegal.”
Port Authority Chief Execu-
tive Ofﬁcer Steve Bland refuted
;McMahon’s claim. “We’re offer-
 ing them excellent pay and ben-
eﬁts, and we’re leaving the doors
open, so how can that be called
a lockout?” Bland told the Post-
Gazette.
Part of the problem is Allegh-
eny County Chief Executive Dan
§Onorato’s decision to withhold
 funds from the Port Author-
lity. About $27 million in county
lfunds from the alcoholic drink
 and car rental taxes are being
iwithheld. Onorato said, accord-
jing to the Post—Gazette, that he
 feared the funds would serve as
 a “Band-Aid” that wouldn’t help
lthe Port Authority in the long-
 term.
V The attempt to resolve the
§ conﬂict soon is an essential and
 positive ﬁrst step in preventing a
 strike and in ensuring that both

reach compromise, and soon

sides understand each other’s
qualms. Port Authority workers
have long been frustrated with
the current uncertain situation.
If they go on strike, thousands
of Allegheny County residents
will be impacted immediately.
According to the Post—Gazette,
230,000 people ride the buses ev-
ery day. .

A strike could also negatively
affect businesses and schools. It
could hurt the state’s economy
and, in the worst-case scenario,
threaten the Port Authority’s ex-
istence as a whole.

Indeed, the consequences of
a strike are endless. Both Local

85 and the Port Authority should -

take this into consideration and
do everything in their powerto
prevent a work stoppage.

Pitt may also be able to do its
part in ensuring a strike does not
occur. After all, the University
has much clout in inﬂuencing the
Port Authority, as it invests close
to $300,000 every month, partly
made up of student fees, for the
discounted ride service available
to all Pitt afﬁliates.

' In the unfortunate event that
a strike does occur, however, Pitt
pledges to provide its students

with alternatives, including an.

expanded campus shuttle system,
Park and Ride shuttles and neigh-
borhood" buses to Edgewood,
Homewood, Highland Park and
Wilkinsburg.

But not all Allegheny County
residents can beneﬁt from such
alternatives, which is why Local
85 and the Port Authority should
do their best to prevent a strike.

Though it might take conces-
sions from both parties to forge _‘

a compromise, on Nov. 23,, both
parties should work together and
negotiate a solution.

Military spending goes beyond Iraq

 
 
      

by Branden Pfeffer
Cola/mzlidt

\With more than $700 billion
in military spending, the U.S. de-
fense budget is greater than the
45 next biggest spenders of the
world put together, according to
the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. No doubt,
you have to get creative to run
up a bill that high. Although the
ongoing wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq are a big drain on funds, they
don’t even represent a quarter of
ﬁscal 2008’s military expenditures.
So, where does the rest of it go?
\Y/ithout further delay, I pres-
ent to you this year’s awards for
Best In-Development Military
Technology...
Honorable

Mention: The

Ray Gun. Designed as a crowd-
control mechanism, the Active
Denial System dishes out 100,000
watts of radio waves, which can
penetrate clothes, plywood and
even mattresses used as shields.
Mounted from the top of a mili-
tary jeep, what looks like an oc-
tagonal satellite can be dialed up
to send painful rays into hostile
masses.

When the high—frequency mi-
crowave radiation hits a person, it
heats up the water in the skin to

a temperature of 130 degrees —,

hot enough to force you back, but
not enough to leave you with any
permanent burns.

A running start won’t help,

either. The ADS can work on A

crowds from up to half a mile
away. Volunteers who have been

shot by the ADS liken: the feeling

Prachi Gupta/Staff aoonist

to being exposed to a hot oven or
even having one’s skin catch ﬁre,
although, as a non-lethal weapon,
there are not supposed to be any
long-term effects. Raytheon, the
company behind the ADS, now
markets a scaled—down version to
law enforcement agencies and se-
curity companies, and the military
is considering using the system in
Iraq.

Bronze Medal: The Exoskel-
eton. Sarcos, a Utah-based ,en—
gineering ﬁrm that was recently
bought by Raytheon, put itself
on the map a few years ago when
word leaked out it was develop-
ing a powered exoskeleton for
soldiers. Loosely resembling the
form of a human skeleton and
weighing 150 pounds, the XOS
exoskeleton is ﬁtted to a soldier,
who can use its 24-hour energy

store to help lift heavy objects for
hours on end.

In a demonstration video, a
soldier stepped into the XOS, and
with little difﬁculty made his way
over to a pull—down machine set
on 200 pounds.

After dozens of repetitions
and with little sign of any strain,
the soldier ﬁnally got up from the
weight machine.

' He stopped not because he
was worn out, but because he was
bored.

Currently, the XOS is designed
for heavy lifting and will soon be
utilized in supply operations that
involve repetitive lifting. Not the
sexiest thing in the world, but
naturally a more advanced version
is in the works —— one aimed at

eliminating its noise and improv- ‘

ing agility in hopes of becoming
battleﬁeld—ready. Master Chief
would be proud.

Silver Medal: Synthetic Telepa-
thy.An early version of this was
invented way back in the 19603
when someone placed an EEG
around his head, then trained him-
self to start and stop his brain’s
alpha waves enough to translate
them into Morse code messages.
Today the U.S. military is granting
money to the nation’s most pres-
tigious engineering programs, like
Carnegie Mellon, in hopes they
will develop the next generation
of synthetic telepathy.

Quite simply, the goal is to
read the electrical activity of the
brain and turn the voice inside

your head into a message that can
be sent to another person without
ever having to utter a word out
loud.

There are a whole host of difﬁ—
culties to overcome with this one.
Of all the different mechanisms
to measure the brain’s electrical
activity, only the EEG is light and
affordable enough to incorporate
into a headset or hat, but doesn’t
detect all brain activity. Still, with
all the potential uses for a com-

‘P munication product like this —
both military and commercial --
Mike D’Zmura, the lead scientist
on one of the telepathy projects,
believes the system can be a mass-
produced reality within two de-
cades.

Gold Medal: The Rail Gun.

It was a tight race between the
first two spots, but when it comes
down to it, anyone that played
Turok 64 knows nothing beats‘
the rail gun.

What makes rail gun technol-
ogy unique is that it uses two elec-
tromagnetic rails to ﬁre a non-
explosive projectile at its target
at speeds of up to Mach 8. This
allows a single 7—pound projec-
tile to ﬂy almost 220 miles -
the distance between Pittsburgh
and downtown Harrisburg —— in
about six minutes, strike a target 5
meters across with startling accu-
racy and carry enough impact to
rip through a tank.

The U.S. Navy tested its most
recent generation of electromag-
netic rail gun technology in 2008

by launching several “low-impact”
test shots that required 32 mega-
joules of energy per shot. Naval
ships are hoping to add these
guns to their arsenal, which would
provide devastating long range
ground support. Right now, the
problem is that the rail gun is too
powerful —— it destroys its own
barrel after just a few shots. If the
Navy can get these problems ﬁg-
ured out, high-powered rail guns
like these could be operational by
2020.

There you have it, the coolest
military tech our tax money goes
toward.

Keep an eye out for next year’s
list.

Dear Editor,

In regards to Giles Howard’s Nov. 12 column, “Prop. 8 a step back for civil rights,” I
can only express a great dismay at what he perceives to be a “civil rights” violation on the
part of the people of California. Howard insists that the Obama administration, coupled
with the Supreme Court, which Howard hopes will be transformed by Obama’s judicial

picks, must right the “injustice.”

For starters, the legal beneﬁts of marriage are no more “rights” as is the “righ ’ to chew
gum. just because someone has the legal license to do something does not always mean
someone who does not is inferior. Citizens younger than 16 in Pennsylvania are no less
human even though they cannot drive No right to  or marriage-defining power
is spelled out by the Constitution. Therefore, any decision on the legality. of  is left
to the states to decide via the Tenth Amendment, which is exactly what California did.

Howard asserts that the Supreme Court must overturn this  implying that the
Court must implement social change with the ttuncheon of federal power. Such an over-
turning of a state’s sovereign right to deﬁne marriage would further solidify the Supreme
Court as an oligarchy rather than as an instrument for judicial review If the gay rights
movement believes its conception of equality as espoused by gay marriage is so funda-
mental to human  let them propose an amendment to the Constitution and let the

Dear Editor,

I would like to respond to the yesterday’s editorial “U.S. automakers don’t deserve a bailout” There is one
key point with which I take issue, and that is the assertion that “unlike a bailout of the bankingindustry, 
out Detroit auto companies isn’t a permanent solution” The editorial goes on to say that because ﬁnancial
institutions just deal with the movement and trade of money,  them more money will solve the prob-

- lem. The ﬁnancial crisis was catalyzed by bankers, whether maliciously motivated or not, selling mortgages to

people that couldn’t afford them. That type of risky, greedy behavior is not  to be alleviated by throw-
ing money at it Money will not offer a permanent solution (as proposed by the editorial) to the underiying
problem of the  industry  manipulative, or at best, shortsighted .

I agree that the auto—makers should be required to invest heavily in more sustainable options and shift
their strategies (which their loans as approved by Congress are supposed to be contingent on), but the state-
ment, "The prospect of these companies potentially going bankrupt shouldn’t change the principles on
which the American economy is built, even if it means sacriﬁcing some venerable companies,” is entirely too
black and white. We’re on the brink of a depression Ford, GM. and Chrysler  bankrupt would mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs lost, not only people that are working hard in factories, but those businesses
surrounding the big three,  restaurants, bars, etc, which will fold as well That would essentially mean wip-
ing out the middle class of an entire area, which could have a domino effect I don’t think that’s something
that the country wants right now, whether or not they “deserve” a bailout I’d love to know what criteria you’d

states have at it give for the ﬁnancial industry “deserving” a bailout The bottom line is, it’s necessary right now.

Last spring four college stu-
dents from Pitt, Point Park and
Pittsburgh Filmmakers came to-
gether to form the band Science
is Dead. Since then, they’ve gone
on to perform in venues from
Pittsburgh to Manhattan.

This Saturday, Science is Dead
will play at Mr. Smalls Funhouse
in Millvale as part of the Cloud
Cult tour with other local bands
Mariage Blanc and Big Hurry.

“I can’t wait until the show at
[Mr.] Smalls on the 15,” said Sci-
ence is Dead guitarist Nate Han-
son. “First off, it’s great to play

The band consists of drum-

freshman, bassist and vocalist

taking this one off, and Pitt’s own

tar and sings.

Although young, the four
bandmates have garnered the re-
spect of both audiences and fel-
low bands within the Pittsburgh»
music scene through focus and
dedication.

“We were always fortunate at
having a lot of great local bands
to look up to and learn from by
listening to their albums, going
to see them play and taking note
of their work ethic, so that we
could emulate that as much as we
could,” he added.

Hanson looks back at this
summer’s performance in a New
York City club as a testament
to the band members’ commit-
ment.

“The coolest part was that we
were these four kids who weren’t
even old enough to drink, but

keep up with a lot of the older,
more experienced bands that we
would play with around Pitts-
burgh,” he said.

One of these local bands that
caught Science is Dead’s atten-
tion was Mariage Blanc, who will
be at Mr. Smalls this weekend as
well, along with Big Hurry.

“Big Hurry is a group of re-
ally talented musicians with great
vocals and really catchy hooks,”
said Hanson.

Merging their past experi-
ences from separate bands, the
four members of Science is
Dead create a mixed sound from
a range of inﬂuences — includ-
ing Fugazi, Small Brown Bike,
Hot Water Music, Don Caballero,
Pikadori, Built to Spill and Tele-
vision.

And from this blend of mus-
es, Science is Dead writes origi-
nal songs to create an indie rock
sound “with some ’80s and early

’90s emo and punk elements,”
said Hanson.

The band is developing a full-
length album at the Machine Age
Studios in Pittsburgh’s Polish
Hill — the same recording studio
Mariage Blanc is affiliated with.

‘‘\We are hoping to release the
full length in the spring and ﬁnd
a label to help us distribute and
promote the album both locally
and regionally,” said Hanson. “As
well as keep building a fan base in
the Pittsburgh area.” _

And this weekend’s show will
allow the up—and—comers to in-
crease their local following.

“People should come to the
show because it is four bands that
play music because they love it,”
said Hanson. “It’s going to be a
night of good music and fun. All
of the bands will go out and have
fun and play as hard as they can.
It will deﬁnitely be a great show.’

Just In It for the Music

Artists may return to norm after Bush is out of the picture

by Justin Jacobs
Ac9’E E3[tor

  
 

It’s been more than a week since
the election, folks, and unless you
are in a coma or a religious fanatic,
you’ve probably come to terms
with the fact that President—elect
Barack Obama will be our next
president.

And that’s ﬁne for us —— which-

ever of those two chaps took

home the prize wouldn’t have re-
ally affected our daily livelihoods
for at least a few months. But what
about those Ameﬁcans who spent
the last months of the campaign
banking their non-political careers
on the political process? Now that
it’s all over, now that McCain can
ﬁnally sit down and take his vita-
mins and Sarah Palin can ﬁnally
drag her pregnant daughter back
to church, what are they going to
talk about? I

No, I’m not talking about Fox
News anchors. I’m talking about
the musicians and artists who
spent the past months simultane— —

ously building up the campaign
and building up their careers. Now
that those liberal rockers got what
they wanted, will they put down
the megaphones and stop writ-
ing pretty songs with lyrics from
Obama speeches?

Well, for the most part, the an-
swer is simple. Most of the “politi-
cally active come election season”
artists will go back to doing what
they do best — making regular old

music about big asses, da club and ‘

stuff like that. All the Will.i.ams,
the Kanye Wests and Billy Joels,
the Fergies and the J. Los and the
Dave Matthews can rejoice that
Obama made it in and go back to
their real ‘lives.

But there is another breed of
musician that won’t have ‘such an
easy transition. They love political
dissent, they play really fast, and
they often have mohawks. Punk
rockers, who often base entire
careers off of criticizing the gov-
ernment, may’ ﬁnd themselves 
oddly pleased with the state of the
country for a change.

Maybe the best example is
Pittsburgh’s own Anti-Flag. The
men of Anti-Flag made their
name playing fast, furious punk
rock with a sole mission to expose
the corruption of the government
and, of course, the man.

The band’s songs read with
titles like “F**k Police Brutality,”

. “This Machine Kills Fascists” and

the catchy “Depleted Uranium is a
War Crime.” The stage banter of
leaders Justin Sane and Chris #2,
at least before the election, often
went as follows: “Put your middle
ﬁngers in the air and chant with
me now  ‘F*** (Insert: Bush,
capitalism, the War in Iraq, politi-
cal apathy  you pick)!”

As the band came into its prime

. in the early 2000s and the politi-

cal climate of the country sunk

lower and lower, Anti-Flag’ had ‘

an easy time riling up the youth to
get angry about social issues and
push for change — the band had
endless material to write about as
there was simply so much to criti-
cize. ‘

For tickets; PITT ARTS at 929 William Pitt um

pittarts@pitt.edu -

Needless to say, I was a bit
skeptical of what exactly the
band’s message would be when I
stopped by its Mr. Smalls show on
Sunday night. Is it going to imme-
diately jump on whatever Obama
policy » they already don’t: agree
with,‘ Ilwondered, or will they turn
those frowns upside down and de-
clare a new day for America, and
for Anti-Flag?

The answer, as it turns out, was
neither.

Now Anti—Flag is a very divi-
sive band —— if you don’t mind
the constant political commentary
paired with punchy punk rock,
then you won’t mind this Pitts-
burgh legend. But to many, hear-
ing song after song of radically
liberal messages make the band
simply seem cartoonish. And for
the latter group, I say, it might be
time to listen back in.

“I saw Barack Obama the

other day on the Allegheny River.
He was walking on water,” said
Justin Sane, mocking the claim of
Obama as the messiah. I could see

 

 412-624-4498
FOt’)t'1iOft1tE1€IDtiZ pgha!”tS.Ot‘g

a bashing on the horizon. I was
wrong.

“Barack Obama, my friends,
is not the change in America
that we want-to see. You are the
change. You elected him, now

you must make sure he does what

he’s promised to do,” said Sane.
“This country is not about Barack
Obama. This country is about all
of you here tonight.” ‘

And there you have it. Anti-
Flag, which has, in the past, called
for Bush to be tried as a war crimi-
nal, resisted both praising and
bashing Obama, instead putting
the power in the hands of the vot-
ers, who, it seems, will be the new
focus of attention for the band.

Anti-Flag, and many like it, may
not have the same base of material
to draw from anymore as Dubya
packs up and heads out, but the

message it will carry to the future a

may be its _most powerful yet.
Punk rock isn’t dead, but it just
got a lot more realistic.

There’s nothing worse than the disil-
lusionment that comes with ﬁnding out
that a favorite artist is not quite as great
as he seemed on his CD.

_Tuesday night Bob Schneider played
at Diesel. But unfortunately, Schneider’s
South Side performance seriously ruined
his street cred. .\ . I

Attempting to promote his new al-
bum, Wben tbe Sun Break: Down 2‘/ye Moon,
Schneider ignored most of the requests

called up from the audience. It's under- _

standable because the loudest of these
requests -was coming from a group of
bottle—breaking audience members.

However, it’s an unwritten rule that
fans want to hear their favorite songs
when they go to see a live performance.

Pittsburgh’s audience didn’t get that
chance, though. And even worse, the new
songs weren’t even that good.

Full of keyboard solos and strange,
long—winded skits about the police in-
teracting with him and his girlfriend, the
songs seemed to drag and bore the audi-
ence. ‘

At one point, the entire audience —
save for the few middle—aged women

November 15, 2008

, keep audience amused 1

trying to catch Schneider’s attention ——

turned around from the stage to watch‘

the end of- the Penguins game, playing on
a big-screen TV behind the bar.

There were a few good songs thrown
into the mix, but overall, the show was
unimpressive.

Perhaps to deﬂect from the sorry col-
lection of new songs, Schneider decided
to throw in some crude humor, joking at
one point about stealing away male audi-
ence members' girlfriends.

You wish, Bob Schneider.

The extremely small crowd —— maybe
50 people at maximum — who showed
up to hear Schneider also seemed disap-

pointed and unenthused. I ended up leav-'

ing early, preferring bed to a keyboard-
laden song that used profane words to
make up for its mediocrity. A

The only bright spot in the night was
the opening act, Amie Miriello. Though
not the most exciting person to watch
onstage, Amie blew the audience away
with her powerful vocals and engaging
lyrics. _

In particular, the songs “I Came
Around,” “Brand New” and a cover of
Peter Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer” really
caught the audience_’s attention.

Shea Stadium album covers classics

by Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer

Live at Shea Stadium
Rocks Like: as only The
Clash can

 

 

Very few albums are worth
waiting more than two decades.
The Clash’s Live at S/yea Stadium is
not one of them, but it is enjoy-
able nonetheless.

The most recent release from
the highly inﬂuential English
punk band is a recording of a
show it played in October 1982.
The concert was hailed by some
as one among The Clash’s last

true performances before inter-
nal tensions caused the band’s
disintegration.

The lineup at the time consist-
ed of lead singer and rhythm gui-
tarist joe Strummer, lead guitarist
Mick Jones, bass guitarist Paul
Simonon and drummer Terry
Chimes. -

The energy of a live perfor-
mance comes across in the record-
ing, as does the 50,000-person
audience’s clearly audible enthu-
siasfn. Shea Stadium was among
the largest shows the band ever
played, creating a double-edged
sword effect of bringing the band
greater fame while preventing the
kind of personal interaction with
its fans the band is so fond of.

The Clash is widely and jus-
tifiably viewed as among the
vanguards of the era’s English
punk scene, but it is also known
for its musical experimentation
with genres from reggae to ska
and funk, making it appealing
to listeners across the board._As
Strummer says at the end of the

track “Tommy Gun,” ‘‘We’d like
to take you to New York, to Ja-
maica and back.”

The set list on the album is a
fair representation of the band’s
considerable breadth of styles,
featuring many of The Clash’s
best known songs, including
“London Calling,” “Rock the
Casbah” and “Train in Vain,” and
a total of six of the band’s eight
U.S. singles.

No dissention can be brooked
with the quality of the songs
themselves, which stand out as
classics. The combination of cre-
ative song composition with pro-
vocative lyrics ranging from left-
ist politics to classic relationship
angst made for timeless anthems
of rebellion  youthful exuber-
ance, from “I fought the law /
And the law won” to “London is
drowning and I / Live by the riv-
er.” “Rock the Casbah” and many
other songs that have become in-
tegrated into pop culture live up
to their hype and are well worth
listening to. '

However, while Clash aficio-
nados may enjoy adding an ad-
ditional recording to their col-
lections — as every rendition of
even the same song will naturally
have slight differences in pacing
and vocal inflection — no track
is so signiﬁcantly different from
others available that it justifies the
purchase. Joe Strummer’s stage
banter is not particularly enter-

taining and could be done with- '

out. .
The Essential C/ax/J, a two—disc
compilation album of studio re-
cordings released in 2003, is a
better choice for those looking
for the deﬁnitive Clash album.

Once a musical group has
transitioned into legend, it be-
comes superﬂuous to release a
“new” album every year or so.
Twenty—f1ve years later, The Clash
is no longer pushing the edge of
the punk movement, and while its
music is and will remain as good
as it ever was, the show at Shea
Stadium is not necessary to prove
that.

right side of cringe-worthy. «

Meyer has said much of the heavy in-
ﬂuence of music on her writing, making
the playlists she listened to while writing
each of her novels available on her Web
site. The actual soundtrack features only

one song from Meyer’s original “Twilight”
playlist — Collective Soul’s “Tremble for
My Beloved” — but does include songs
from two of Meyer’s favorite bands, Linkin
Park and Muse.

Paramore supplied two t1'acks: “I
Caught Myself” and the soundtrack’s lead
single, “Decode.” Both songs have strong
themes of uncertainty and regret, but are
redeemed by attractive beats and excellent
vocal performances.

The inclusion of “Never Think,” by
Twilight co—star Robert Pattinson, is likely
more of a press gimmick than anything
else, as the song combines decisively lack-
luster and off-kilter acoustic  with
whiny prosaic lyrics like, “I should never
think / What’s in your heart / What’s in
our home / So I won’t.”

The film will feature Carter Burwell’s
original score, of which “Bella’s Lul-

Vampire ams will excite   ‘Twilight’ fans

  

—— is also includ-
on the Tu/i/zgg/Jt
soundtrack.

“Twilight: The
Score” will be

released Dec 9.
A ' fun
and ‘ fast-paced new

Mute Math song from its forthcoming al-
bum debuts on the soundtrack, “Spotlight
(Twilight Mix).” Perry Farrell wrote an
original song for the movie, “Go All ‘the
Way (Into the Twilight),” featuring discon-
Certing kittenish crooning, “Everyday, ev-
eryday, everyday / We’re going all_the way
/ Tonight! / Lightning strikes! / Let’s go
into Twilight!” '

Overall the tracks are a well—chosen col-
lection accurately portraying the book and
presumably the movie, which premieres
Nov. 21. i

The only possible exceptions being
“Full Moon” by The Black Ghosts, with a
catchy tempo and intriguing rural melodies
ill-suited to the soundtrack’s theme, and
Iron & Wine’s “Flightless Bird, American

.Mouth,” which feels sorely incongruous
with the rest of the tracks. _ I

Regardless of how one feels about the
music itself, one cannot deny the prow-
ess of Tuzi/z'gbt’s marketing and franchising
team. '

The.CD booklet folds out to one of
four different versions of a Twikgbt poster,
sure to enchant the target pre-teen girl au-
dience. .

Promotions to ramp up excitement have
included listening parties at Hot Topic sto-
ries across the country on Oct. 24 and the
release of a special edition of the CD at

Borders bookstore featuring an exclusive

acoustic version of “Decode.”

Devoted Twilight enthusiasts will likely
purchase the movie’s soundtrack entirely
irrespective of its track list, but even non-
vampire fanatics will find it enjoyable.

Pitt junior Michelle Rossi (18) has  the libero position for the Panthers, which means she is a defensive specialist.

Junior leading Pitt's rise up Big East standings

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬁ’ Writer

If there is one thing Pitt volleyball’s Mi-
chelle Rossi knows best, it’s defense.

“In a sport like volleyball, every aspect of
the game is extremely important,” said Ros-
si. “[But] personally I enjoy frustrating the
other team by digging their attacks that they
thought would result in their point.”

Rossi, a junior, came to Pitt in 2006 as a
defensive specialist, commonly referred to as
a libero in volleyball. And since her arrival,
she’s lived up to that position.

As only the second libero in school his-
tory, Rossi has anchored the Pitt defense and
used her skills to make an impact in Big East
volleyball. After leading the team in digs as
a freshman with 487, Rossi took control of
the conference a year later by averaging 5.04
digs per game.

“My early success deﬁnitely fueled me to
work harder and continue to get better,” said
Rossi. “It has also made me have extremely

high expectations for myself and pushes me
to perform well to help allow my team to
achieve our goals.” '

First-year head coach Toby Rens couldn’t
be happier with Rossi’s play.

“It’s awesome,” said Rens. “Her work eth-
ic and tenacity is second to none.”

Michelle . if
Rossi

Growing up in Parma, Ohio, a suburb
southwest of Cleveland, Rossi was bound to
keep the family volleyball tradition alive. Liv-
ing in a household that had her sisters and

v

her mother busy with the sport, volleyball
was always on her mind. --

“Both my older sisters played volleyball,
and I got to go to all their practices and
games because my mom was their coach,”
said Rossi. “I loved going to my sister’s prac-
tices, and I tried to get in the drills as much

as possible.” *._.

That practice paid off.

Rossi finished her high school career by
breaking school records in digs, kills and
aces. Her performance during those years
forced colleges to. take notice.

Like it’s done to many of Pitt’s previ-?..
ous standouts, the Panthers coaching staff
recruited Rossi heavily. There were other
schools that went after her, too, but the ur-
ban atmosphere of Oakland brought her to
Pittsburgh.

“I was recruited by Pitt and other colleg-‘
es, but Pitt really stuck out to me,” she said.
“I loved the campus, the coaching staff and
the attitude by the players. I knew right away

Notebook: Pitt finds

points in unusual places

W Michael Heatl Photo Editor

Pitt receiver Oderick Turner grabs a touchdown reception away from Louisville's
Woodny Turenne in Saturday's 41-7 win. The catch went for 26 yards.

by Kyle Craig
Staﬁ’ Wrtter

With Pitt’s offensive superstar, running
back LeSean McCoy, contained to a career-
low 39 rushing yards Saturday against Lou-
isville, the Panthers were forced to ﬁnd
more creative ways to reach the end zone.

Besides McCoy, four other Panthers
scored touchdowns, each of them for the
ﬁrst time this season. Offensively, Aundre
Wright took a handoff out of the Wild-
cat formation for six points, and Oderick
Turner caught a 26-yard touchdown pass.

“I think we proved we’re a little more
than just one-dimensional,” said Pitt coach
Dave Wannstedt during a post—game inter-
view.

The Pitt defense also generated points
for the ﬁrst time this year, scoring two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Corner-
back Ricky Gary scored his first collegiate
touchdown by walking an ill-advised lateral
into the end zone. On the next Cardinals
possession, Scott McKillop intercepted a
Hunter Cantwell pass and returned it 18
yards for the score.

.“That’s going to happen every week,”
said Wannstedt about the diversity on of-
fense. “Somehow, some way, we’ve_ got to
ﬁnd away to score points.”

McCoy had rushed for more than 140
yards in Pitt’s last ﬁve games. Despite his
struggles on Saturday, McCoy was able
to score a rushing touchdown in his ﬁfth

a straight game. Now, he leads all Big East

rushers with 16 touchdowns.
In fact, the entire Pitt offense has
climbed to the top of a few Big East of-

fensive categories. After scoring 41 points
against Louisville, the Panthers are now av-
eraging 30.9 points per game. That mark
ties with South Florida for first on the con-
ference scoring leaderboard.

Fourth Down Frequenters

Pitt successfully converted two more
fourth-down conversions during Saturday’s
contest. The Panthers are now 13 for 17
on fourth-down tries and lead the Big East
with a 76.5—percent conversion rate; Quar-
terback Bill Stull credits his team’s success
on fourth down to its will power and deter-
mination.

“It honestly goes down to who wants it i

more,” said Stull after Saturday’s game.

I The *Pitt offense has received a boost
of conﬁdence from its fourth-down suc-
cess and the coaching staff ’s willingness to
consistently roll the dice.

“It’s awesome to have a head coach who
is conﬁdent with us to [go for it on fourth
down] ,” said Stull.

Throughgnine games, the Panthers have
successfully converted six more fourth
downs than any other team in the Big
East.

Embracing the Bye

Pitt is entering its third bye week of

the season. In the past, Dave Wannstedt
has been criticized for not having his team
ready to compete after a bye. This season,
however, the Panthers have been 2-0 after
having a weekend off, with wins against
Iowa at home and Navy on the road.

Rossi's experience crucial for Panthers

Rossi, page 13

that I would love Pitt.” ,

Still, switching cities hasn’t changed
her mind on who to root for in the NFL.
Rossi, a life—long Browns fan, still holds
the orange and brown dear to heart.

But when it comes to Pittsburgh, it’s
not about the Steelers or the Browns, it’s
about winning games for the Panthers.

“The Big East is an extremely difﬁcult.

conference to play in because every game
is so im ortant” said Rossi. “An team

, .
can win on any given day, and we can’t

take any teams lightly. I’ve never seen or,

heard of a conference with this many up-
sets and ties.”

Excitement is always high for Rossi
and Pitt. Having already beaten teams like
Cincinnati, Notre Dame and South Flori-
da this season, the team has high expecta-
tions for the Big East tournament. And
the pressure of playing tough games has
brought Rossi and the rest of the team
together.

“Sharing an experience like playing a
sport at this high of a level really brings
you together,” said Rossi. “They become
your family away from home. We all share
the same goals and that really brings us
closer.”

The progress of Rossi has also kept the
success going for Pitt. Having started in
every game for the team since her fresh-
man year, Rossi’s focus and never—give-up

A attitude are just what the coaching staff

was looking for.

Rens explained that the Panthers were
looking for somebody to begin assuming
a leadership role this season. In her third
year at Pitt, Rossi had done just that.

“While she is on the court, she is able
to really communicate a lot of what she
is seeing,” said Rens. “She is very experi-
enced as a player. So, it’s nice to see that
improvement where she is really commu-
nicating a lot of good information to her

Thank you Pitt News Readers!
‘Best Chinese food '1 years in a row!

teammates during the course of a game.”

It’s not just the coaches who are taking
notice, though. Rens explained that the
rest of the team rallies around her and
that her work ethic both on and off of
the court is what has earned her the re-
spect of her teammates.

“She embodies the type of player that

would run through a wall for her team,”
he said.

While Rossi appreciates that praise,
she knows it’s not about personal suc-
cess. For her, it’s about winning games as
a team and making an impact in the Big
East. She believes the attitude of the team
is to always succeed.

And although the season isn’t quite
over for Pitt, the team is already expecting
even bigger things from Rossi next year.

“With the experience that she has gar-

AND PUBLIC SERVICE

nered over the past three years as a starter,
she’ll be able to share that with the team
next year as a senior,” said Rens.

But for Rossi, looking at next year isn’t
a top priority. A

“I think it is extremely important not
to look too far ahead,” she said. “My main
focus now is to end this season strongly.
I will start to digest the idea of being a
senior next year in our off season.”
