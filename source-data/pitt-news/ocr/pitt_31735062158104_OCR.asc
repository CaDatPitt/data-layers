Dawson revealed that he

to withhold the information until later.

He felt now was the time

Dawson’s comment on the an

he will try to continue here until
his contract expires next February 

 

~if‘his doctor says his health will‘

The former mentor said tersely

he decided to come out with his

inﬂuence on his decision and add-

will take him out of the city.

Part of his official announce-
ment read: “I’m proud of the fact
that my staff under the leadership

Need For Ideals

By JIM DeWEESE

reception in. the Commons
Room. and heard brief talks
by the deans of the Univer-
sit, Chancellor Fitzgerald, and
Tom Rutter, last year’s recipi-
ent of the S Award.

the large freshman class and to
the new Men's Orientation Pro-

who stated that “The parents as

stressing the gain from extra-

JHe raised the question, “. . .

for it. He stated that we must de- .

termine what makes a student
want to study and then get him
to do his best.

Edward C. Reif, dean of the
School of Pharmacy, outlined his
school’s curriculum. Dean of
Women Helen P. Rush stated that
students at Pitt are important as
individuals. “It is important to let
them know that life can be good
and to give them confidence. . . .
No democracy can survive with-
out that desire to learn on the
part of these (freshmen students)
favored youth.” .

She stressed the importance
of encouraging students to stay’
on campus after classes in order
to get a full measure of enjoy-
ment from their university life.
“It (university). is not a place
of credits and dinlomas so much
as it is _a way of life. It prom-
ises us the only life that is
worth living.”

 Marking 37th Year

Of Un iversityPlugging

By CECY LINCOFF

For 37 years, Anne_Loughrey has livened the Wires of
the University’s switchboard with her melodious——“Univer-
site-e—e-e-e.” I ,

From the old switchboard headquarters a small room on
the third ﬂoor of the Cathedral, to the cheerful air-condi-
tioned operators’ quarters. now on theground ﬂoor, Mrs.
Loughrey has seen three Chancellors head the University.

, son or department requested.

She confesses that she misses “that half a room” on the
third ﬂoor. It was so hot, the door had to be kept open and
everyone dropped in to say hello.

Few Visitors 1
Now, with the comfort of air-_f
ccnditioning, the door is closed,§

and Very few people find their: ‘

way into the room to pass the};
time of day. 5
The reason for_ these very few
visits may be due to the fact ;
that the location of the switch-
board is unknown to most peo-
ple. ‘Little would one realize»
that the unmarked room across

the hall from the photo club}, 

darkrom on the ground floor

contains two full-time telephone

operators working a. doub

switchboard. ’
, Mrs. Loughrey is the head tele-
phoneyoperator of the University.
Before becoming the switchboard
worker, she was a stenographer
here.

1800 Calls Daily

She is quite enthusiatic about
the new building program and
said, “I only hope I live to see
everything completed.”

Mrs. Lollghrey estimates that
approximately 1800 calls come
into the University daily. Bell
Telephone Company took a
count some time ago, but since
then, no exact poll has been
taken.

- The courtesy extended by Mrs.
Loughrey to callers is rated by the
central Bell Telephone office. Ob-
servation sheets are kept by an
operator from the central office
who “plugs in,” unknown to the
Pitt line, at any time.

Certain regulations must be ob-
served by the operators: all calls
must be answered within six sec-
onds, the operator must announce
who she is, thus “Universiteeeee,”
and she must let the caller know
that she has received their mess-
age, by saying “thank you,” or
repeating the name of the per-

No Grades Given
Periodically, the representative
from. the central company visits
Pitt and ‘informs the operators of
their observation ratings.

'Mrs. Loughrey is one of three
operators employed by the Uni-
versity. She and Mrs. Helen
Vorchakl work during the day,
and a third employee takes over
until. 9 p.m.

According to Mrs. Loughrey,
the heaviest calls come at regis-
tration, commencement, and exam
week. Students persist in calling
for their grades, but they are
never given on the phone.

-If the switchboard is over-
crowded with calls, the central
phone office cuts in and gives a
busy signal so that the connected
calls may be cleared.

After working -for 37 years,
Mrs. Loughrey can connect the
numerous switchboard plugs in a
matter of seconds. V

Stuttering Debunked;
Group well Adjusted

Two Pitt speech department researchers have debunked
the ideas of the “stutterer personality” and that stutterers, as’
a group, are maladjusted. _

Dr. George Shames, assistant professor of psychology

and speech, and Jack Matthews, associate professor of psy- A
chology and director of the Pitt Speech Clinic, after ex-’

tensive research say that stutterers are no more maladjust-
ed, as a group, than people with
normal speech. 4

“It has become common prac-

may be better adjusted to his _de-T
fect than those around him who

abastractionistic and expression-
istic art.

Women’s Recreation Association
and Women’s chorale will play
major roles in the revised pro-
gram. A movie will be shown for
the third phase. A

The coed Chorale will develo
cubistic or still life through song.
A modern ballet, presented by
WRA will concern abstractionistic
artistry. Ideas of expressionistic
paintings will be shown through
the movie. .

Original music for the ballet has
been composed by Lloyd Kropp,
Col. ’56, Carole Streiner, Col. ’56,
prepared and directed the choreo-
graphy. She’ll be featured soloist
during the modern dance present-
‘tion.

Beaux Arts was originally pre-
sented as an upperclass project to
honor freshmen women. It has as
its main purpose to interest them
in a study of classics and art.
Noticeable student interest in the
presentation resulted in its ex-
pansion to enable all students and
faculty to attend free of charge.

Until this year, the society con-
cerned itself with past arty styles

“Beaux Arts Moderne” . increased
with the participation of other
student groups interested in music.

Miss Barbara Mclntyre, speech

instructor, is faculty sponsor for

Stephen Foster Memorial. ‘Scottish
singers, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lieper
and Dave Sneddon, will entertain

The original manuscript of the
book, “Jock Sutherland, Architect
of Men” by Dr. Harry G. Scott,
will be presented to W. S. McLay,
chairman of the Scottish Room
Committee, by Dr. Sutherland’s
brother William for safekeeping

along with John Michelosen, will
assist in the presentation.

tice to assume that the stutterer
is maladjusted because of his
speech defect,” the Pitt research-
ers point out. “Because of these
assumed abnormalities, it is easy
to fee sorry for him. which may
be damaging because he may be
as generally well adjusted as the
person with normal speech.”
They added that where per-
sonality maladjustments w e r e
found amon-g stutterers, they were

Dr. Shames and Matthews ob-
served stutterers in several age

groups and from several parts or

the country, and found that in any
group of people, half of them
stutterers, given a battery of psy-
chological tests designed to meas-
ure deviations from normal per-
sonality, the result will give no
indication as to which have
speech defects.

ABSTRACT-—Although the
members of the Women’s Rec-
reation Association seen above
are very real, they are attempt-
ing to explain an abstract, sub-
ject—abstractionistic art through

the medium of modern dance.
Women’s Chorale will also par-

Student enthusiasm overrode good judgment last -Mon-

' day as a group of students from Carnegie Tech invaded

this university during the second and third hours.

At least six classes had to be dismissed as the cele-
brants marched through the halls shouting and throwing
confetti. Several class rooms were entered and lectures
had to be suspended. « C

P Tech’s Dean of Men Ben David commented Tuesday
morning that, “It was indeed an unfortunate episode. We feel
badly about it.” The invasion came as the aftermath of a
pep rally honoring Tech’s undefeated team, that school’s
first in 47 years, According to Dean David, 1500 to 18(l0
students took part in the rally but all returned to their
classes after it was over. _

He stated that it was not the rally crowd but a fringe
element fromthe Tech cafeteria which took it upon them-
selves to march on Pitt. He added that, “We tried desper-
ately to keep control.”

Damage from the visitation was slight according to
University Marshall J. E. Hedges. Chalk scrawles on the
stairways and overturned sand crocksin the halls marked
its extent. L

This incident appears to be in direct violation to the
long Jpending rally damage pact which is still in the dis-
cussion stages. Student Congress President Emil Herman
stated that he would go to Tech and talk with the Student
Council in an effort to ratify the pact.

Certainly theﬁrst undefeated season in 47, years is
worthy of a celebration but not the type which carries
over to other campuses which are not concerned with the
event. And certainly not at~the expense of instructors and
students ,whose classes are disrupted.

This “episode is a ﬁne example of what can happen
when feeling runs too high. It has happened here at Pitt.
We don’t want it to reoccur. The Pitt—Penn State game

— this weekend may prove to be worthy of celebration but it

must be conﬁned to this campus. Nothing would serve
to more pointedly mark the immaturity and smallness of
our student body than a trip to Tech.

Such aisortie would serve no purpose other than to
cause strained relations between the two schools and to
vindicate Tech’s visit here on Monday.

By abstaining from such conduct, however, Pitt stu-
dents would pay a tribute to their team and their school
while. at the same time renouncing that element of the
student body at Tech which marched on Pitt last Monday.
The purpose of a rally should be to honor a winning team,
not to dishonor the university.

The iWork of

By Jim DeWeese

A man acknowledged the Nobel Peace Prize in
Norway last week. He stood in a time worn black
suit and, in his acknowledgment, pointed the way
to peace for a troubled world. His message; Man
can abolish war only through c a revival of the
same ethical spirit which lifted Europe from the
Dark Ages.

The man is a ﬁghter, en-
gaged in a relentless War against
his enemy. And yet he was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
to further his ﬁght. Andthe citi-
zens of Norway raised an addi-
tional 35 thousand dollars for his
cause.

His battle is against those
eternal, omnipresent enemies of
mankind, suffering and pain. His ' ' -
battle ﬁeld, French Equatorial Africa. The primi-
tive conditions under which he must work have
transformed this man into a hard driving, hard
driven legend about whom there is lmuch specu-
lation and little known fact.

Materiality Sacrificed '

It was for this anonymity that this man sacri-
ﬁced a brilliant career as a musician, as a writer,
as a philosopher, as a doctor. In any one of these
ﬁelds he would have stood as an authority, a
leader upon whom his contemporaries would have
looked with respect and admiration. He could
have been an independently wealthy man by cash-
ing in on his abilities. -

His creed is reflected in the statement, “Man
has become a superman . . . because he not only
disposes of innate physical for_ces, but because he
is in command, thanks to the conquests of science
and technique, of latent forces in nature . . . the
superman, in the measure that his power increases,
becomes himself poorer and poorer. In order to
avoid destruction, he is obliged to hide himself
underground like the beasts of the ﬁelds . . .
(lacking) superhuman reason . . . the more we be-
come supermen, the more we become inhuman.
Peace Prize Applied

Nearly 42 years ago this man went to Lamba-
rene in French Equatorial Africa and settled in

a small mission hut which he found there. From
this beginning, he proceeded to build a general
hospital. The Nobel Prize, $33,149, is being applied
to the building of a village near this hospital, a
village devoted to the care of lepers and research
on that disease. ’ 

This _man is ﬁghting not only the disease but
also the misconceptions and hysterical connota-
tions which the word holds for the people of the
world. Here, in this village which he has built
literally with his own hands, he has instilled an air
of informality and friendlinessiwhich, along with
drugs, holds the best hope for curing the dread
disease. Whereas the natives are run out of their
home villages or killed when they contract the dis-
ease, they receive a human treatment from this man
which is all but unparalleled in history.

Death Has No Place

He turns away from death, ignoring its always P”

present shadow when he is able. But at times he

ﬁnds this impossible as some friend,iwho has left

a mark in his life, passes away. Then he walks
to the grave and bows his rebellious head in sa-
lute to his enemy. _ V

And for this he left the world of men at the
age of 38. Now, at 79, he still writes even though
he has published more than 17 books ranging from
philosophy to music lessons. A renown organist,
he still practices on a piano equipped with organ
pedals. His powers of concentration are so in-
tense that when he is not seated at his organ-
piano, he can play the works of Bach, using a
table top for his mute keyboard.
Conquest of Pain

The story of this man cannot be told in words
because’ of their shear inadequacy to rise to his
greatness. He has written, “All life is suffering,”
and has dedicated his life to both the conquest

.of pain and the alleviation of suffering.

This then is the man who stands apart and
alone from the fellow men whom he has divorced
from his life. The man who accepted the Nobel
Peace Prize, not as a reward,‘ but as a means by
which to build. The man'who is as unyielding
in his conquest of pain as the very earth into
which he must surrender his enemies victories.
The man called Albert Schweitzer.

They- are constantly nagging
about a school spirit that has so
far remained
nagging is directed at everybody.
Perhaps some students are not
interested in Pitt’s gridiron at-

cers into non-
functional stu-
dent organiza-
tions. Perhaps
they don’t care
w h 0 presents

1 o w vdiatribes
in- committee
meetings_ ‘that
are repeatedly
unable to show
any concrete results. They are
in squinting
cynically through the doors of
the meeting rooms.

But when it comes time for the
chancellor’s .reception and time
for "the parents to meet the fac-
ulty and administration who will
guide their ‘children through a
four years’ search, the sarne peo-
ple who squinted at conferences
are on hand to proudly greet the
parents at the door of a structure
that impresses them to the point
of sadness.

A sadness that its peace, mag-
nitude, and stony solidness can-
not be approached. At night they
are depressed when they look at

the lights challenging through the .

windows. They wonder if they
have worked their hardest work,
played their hardest play, made
an intimate friend, formed un-
scathed friendships.

Proud of Achievements

As they look they thrill to
realize that they see and think
more clearly from their experi-
ences at Pitt. They marvel that
Jonas Salk is associated with
their Alma Mater. They run
home to tell neighbors that their
school was considered great
enough to merit a 15 million
dollar grant for expansion of

undeﬁned. Their .

 

medical facilities. They are in-
spired to think that the graduate
schools are producing better stu-
dents through modern methods
and equipment. These are the
tangible things, the things worth
beingexcited about. «

’ Time Valuable
These people cannot be con-.

demned for sitting tight—lipped
at football games or taking an
extra step to avoid a politician.
Nor do they have any obligation
to dissipate their valued time on
meetings held because they are

groups listed as holding weekly’

meetings.

They would derive no satis-
faction from having their name
stamped to a bill proposing a
senior prom. They ‘would rather
act~ toward producing something
beneﬁcial to mankind, rather than
thinking about nonsense all year
at drawn out sessions.
High Values

These are the people with
higher values. They'ch0ose one
of the campus groups that are
coducted efficiently, with ends in
mind that give valuable practice
in chosen careers. They enter
debate, choral groups, publica-
tions, one of the religious organ-
izations. These are the groups
that elect oﬁicers on the basis of
work-output, not effective cam-
paigning._ They rightly look down
on scribbled messages on side-
walks, shady posters, and foolish
campaign promises. They accept
offices only when they think they

are strong enough to extend a
sturdy, .capable hand to the
younger people soon to revamp
-their loved organizations.

Profit from Advice

Many of these people scrape up
$16 a credit to enjoy the privilege
of listening to the experiences

. and advice of someone a little
wiser, willing to pass on the
knowledge for which he struggled
hard to a younger ignorant group.
Their school spirit is exempliﬁed
during lectures when they sit
captivated, concentrating with
every bone on information inter-
esting and worthwhile to them.

These are the ones that frown
at cutting classes, marvel at the
quality of instruction to be found
in Pitt classrooms, despise the
jeers pointed toward the elbowed
lecturns at the front of the room.

Soiled Files. Untouched

They would not consider soil-
ing their hands by digging into
yellowed ﬁles for themes de-
signed‘ toward easy plagiarism
for pledges. The’pledges of the
same fraternity labeled as the
most effective leaders of school
spirit.

Such is their school spirit. Why
must they endlessly be subjected
to speeches on attending pep
rallies, voting, joining? Different
people have different, values. It
is no wonder that pep rallies and
weekly meetings are vile beds
that sprout and foster the growth
of cynicism in many souls.

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT I

Of all the creatures that inhabit the earth, none is so fair, so warm,

so toothsome, as a coed. , I
This is a simple fact, well-known to every campus male, and, to
most campus males, 9. source of rejoicing. But’ not to all. To some,
the creamy brows and twinkling limbs of coeds are a bane and a
urden. To whom? To professors, that's whom. '

Professors, according to latest scientiﬁc advice, are human. Stick »

them and they bleed, pinch them and they hurt, ring a ‘dinner bell
and they salivate, comfront them with a ‘round young coed and
-their ears go back, even as yours and mine.

But, by and large, they contain themselves. After all, they are
men of high principle and decorum, and besides, the board of regents
has got stoolies all over. So, by and large, they contain themselves.

But not always. Every now and then a coed will come along who
is just too gorgeous to resist, and a professor - his clutch worn out
from years of struggle - will slip and fall. _White though his hair,

multitudinous though his degrees, Phi Beta Kappa though his key,’

he is as lovesick, moonstruck, and impaled as any freshman.

But he's far worse off than any freshman. After all, a freshman
can thump his leg, put on his linen duster, and take out after the
coed with mad abandon. But what can the poor smitten prof do?
How, in his position, can he go courtin a young girl undergraduate?

In this column and the next one, I am going to deal with this
difficult question. I will relate to you, in the form of a two act play,
an account of a professor’s attempt to woo a coed.

The scene is a typical office in a typical liberal arts building on
a typical campus. In this shabby setting, we ﬁnd two men, Professors

Twonkey and Phipps. They are lumpy and bent, in the manner of ,

English lit professors. .

PHIPPS: Twonkey, a terrible thing has happened to me. A terrible,
ghastly thing! I've fallen in love with a coed.

TWONKEY: Now, now, that's not so terrible.

PHIPPS: Oh, but it is. Miss McFetridge—for that is her name——is
a student, a girl of nineteen. How would her parents feel if they
knew I was gawking at her and refusing my food and writing her
name on frosty windowpanes with my ﬁngernail?

TWONKEY: Come now, Phipps, no need to carry on so. You’re not
the ﬁrst teacher to cast warm eyes at a coed, you know.

PHIPPS: You mean it’s happened to you too?

TWONKEY: But of course. Many times.

PHIPPS: What did you do about it?

TWONKEY: Looked at their knees. It never fails, Phipps. N o matter
how pretty 9. girl is, her knees are bound to be knobby and bony and
the least romantic of objects.

PHIPPS: Not Miss McFetridge’s—for that is her name. They are
soft and round and dimpled. Also pink.

TWONKEY: Really? Well, I’ll tell you something, Phipps. If I
ever found a girl with pink knees, I’d marry her.

PHIPPS: It is my fondest wish, but how can I, a professor of ﬁfty,
start a courtship with a girl of 19? T

TWONKEY: Very simple. Ask her to come to your office for a.
conference late tomorrow afternoon. When she arrives, be urbane, be
charming. Ask her to sit down. Give her a cigarette.

PHIPPS: A Philip Morris. ‘

TWONKEY: But of course.

PHIPPS: I just wanted to be sure you mentioned the name. They're
paying for this column.

TWONKEY: Give her a Philip Morris.

PHIPPS: That's right. '

TWONKEY: Then light her Philip Morris and light one yourself.
Say some frightfully witty things about English lit. Be gay. Be
insouciant. Keep her laughing for an hour or so. Then look at your
watch. Cry out in surprise that you had no idea it was this late.
Insist on driving her home.

PHIPPS: Yes, yes?

TWONKEY: On the way home, drive past that movie house that
shows French ﬁlms. Stop your car, as though on a sudden impulse. -
Tell her that you’ve heard the movie was delightfully Gallic and
naughty. Ask her if she’d like to see it.

PHIPPS: Yes, yes?

_ TWONKEY: After the movie, say to her in a jocular, offhand way
that after such a ﬁne French movie, the only logical thing would be
a ﬁne French dinner. Take her to a funny little place you know,
with candles and checked tablecloths. Ply her with burgundy and
Philip Morris. Be witty. Be gay. Be Gallic . . . How can a nineteen
year old girl resist such blandishments?

PHIPPS: Twonkey, you're a genius! This will be like shooting ﬁsh
in a barrel. . . But I wonder if it isn't taking Kynfair advantage of
the poor little innocent.

TWONKEY: Nonsense, Phipps.,,All’s fair in love and war.

PHIPPS: You’re right, by George. I’ll do it!

“Old ___l_Ijonsdes" U

Lions Aim for Panthers
After Three Breathers

By GENE AROMATORIO

It may be,a long, cold winter and someone is going to
be left without a coal skuttle with which to keep the hot
stove league burning during the coming months.

Who that someone is will be determined this Saturday
when Pitt’s Panthers and Penn¢
State’s Nittany Lions tangle at the
Stadium in the 54th renewal of
their heated series.

“Old Ironsides” is the tradi- k
tional trophy that goes to the
top team of the three district
rivals——Pitt, Penn State, and
West Virginia. The skuttle is
now in the possession of the
Mountaineers, having gone to
the Lions -«in its first year of
existence, and a win by the Pan-

Teachers in which D’Amato scored
probably their best, performances
of the season. .

Cost led the Panthers in
ground-gaining with his biggest
advance coming on a 40-yard run
which caried to the home-team

three, from where Grier banged
over for the score. Bagamery also
plunged over for a six-pointer.

ED BOSE

thers this weekend would put
the much-coveted prize in Pan-
ther hands for the first time.

The Panthers warmed up for
the final tilt of the season by cut-
ting down the Cornhuskers from
Nebraska, 21-7, in a game which
the Jungle Cats were supposed to
lose. On the other hand, the Lions
have been warming up for three
weeks against such easy foes as
Penn, -Holy Cross, and Rutgers.

With the Staters posing the last
game of the season, it might be
expected that the starting lineup
is pretty well set, but this is not
the case. Last week against the

riers fell short in their bid to capture the IC4A crown over
the level ﬁve-mile Van Cortlandt Park course in New York
City on Monday. 4

Whereas last year they ﬁnished second to Michigan
State, Monday afternoon found them falling to Manhattan,
75-110. Following came Villanova with a score of 136, Penn

State with 138, and Georgetownt
with a mark of 178.

Although he practiced only
once last week prior to the tour-
nament due to a virus, Arnie So-
well ran a courageous race that

netted him sixth place in a field
comprised of 400 runners from 45
different colleges. His time was
24:59.

Gundy Takes 15th
Individual honors in the 46th
annual spectacle went to George
Terry of Boston University who
raced over the distance in 24:36.

The only other Panther besides
Sowell to finish better than 20th
was Captain Alan Gunderson who
took 15th place with a time of
25:31.

Jack Schubert finished 26th,
Thorton Smith 31st, Tom Jessup
45th, Jim Moore 48th, and Bob
Cherry 54th.

Used Five Sophs

“It was a pretty good showing,”
commented Olson on the perform-
ance that his thinclads turned in.
“We never expected to go this
far at the begining of the season.
We had to replace five graduat-

ing seniors, and the sophomore re-
placements constituted a surpris-
ing team.”

Although Sowell finished sixth,

he was only 23 seconds behind the
winner, Terry of Boston Univ.

“I didn’t want to press him into
practice this past week because
there is nothing more important
than a boy’s health,” stated Olson.
“And, although he finished sixth,
he still ran a terrific race.”

Next on the agenda for the
Blue and Gold is the NCAA tour-
nament at East Lansing, Michigan,
next Monday, where the local
harriers wil again be running on
unfamiliar terrain.

Gridders Favor
Nursery Rhyme

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

Almost everyone on the Pitt side thought it was a dar-

ing stratagem by Captain Tom Hamilton in-starting his 

second team against the Nebraska last Saturday except one
fellow who used to be on the Panther side.

This fellow, Biff Glassford, also known‘as the present
professor of football at Lincoln, said, “It didn’t make any
difference to us, they (the ﬁrst and second squads) were
about the same in strength. In fact, the second team moved
the ball better against us.” .

The former Panther star may say it was no different
to him but to the local gathering, an explanation was in
order. Hamilton was ready for the barrage after the con-
test and simply pointed out what led up to this game as
the reason.

“The ﬁrst team looked kind of flat in practice this
past week while the second team looked good and they
deserved a chance to start and got it.” As to their play,
the Captain replied that he was “pleased with both
squads.”

Previously in the week, the Interim Coach gave some
notice of a change when he sent his varsity to the showers
early one day and worked with the rest of the gridders.

Although at the time it was considered just an incident to _

be forgotten, it proved the impetus to revise the lineup.
* * *

Nebraska sure, pumps the propaganda into their foot-
ballers. Pasted on the Husker dressing room bulletin board
was the complete Panther ﬁrst two strings with pictures,
numbers, heights, and weights. The pictures were lined up
to form a seven-man line with the four. backs in proper po-
sitions too. The information on each one was printed in red
ink below the photos, and that’s not all! '

Around all this free publicity were various clipping from
the downtown newspapers in Pittsburgh telling how the Pan-
thers were planning to defeat the Cornhuskers and, of course,
the added written, comments of the Nebraskans on the side.

Then, in selected places of. the locker room and show-‘

ers, cardboard signs saying “Pitt the Panthers” and “De-
pant the Panthers” were also prominent.

When questioned about these devices, Glassford noted
that they were commonplace for all the contests and
not especially for the local visitdrs. “Next week, it’ll
probably be ‘set sail on the Sooners’ or something like
that for the ‘Oklahoma game,” he added. \

But this isn’t'anything new to the Panthers. The West
Virginias also had a big publicity campaign out for the local
invasion and that, like this one, didn't stop the Pitts.

And now, word from the Penn State campus is that
they’re putting on the biggest spirit-raising jamboree this
side of the Alleghenies for their arrival in town. ‘Are the
Panthers worried? Of" course, not. Their propaganda con-
sists of the simple nursery rhyme that goes “Sticks and stones
will break my bones but names will never hurt me.”

Luck of the Irish
Brings Ireland
New Medico Pipe

Ah, and it was a great day for
the Irish last Saturday. Not
only did the Irish of South Bend
fame -come through as expected
in their game, but James Ire-
land of Verona, in County Al-’
legheny, came through the win-
ner in the weekly football con-
test. —

It turned out that the football
Irish had much the easier time
of it, too. James, that young

broth of a prognosticator, found
himself tied with ten other
would-be swamies, but as the
luck of the Irish would have it,
he came closest in predicting the
winning scores.

As a result, the Industrial En-
gineer ﬁnds himself the owner
of a ﬁne Medico Pipe with his
clan initial stamped on the bowl.

Plans for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Pitt’s

oldest fraternity chapter were

announced last Friday by the

undergraduate chapter of Delta Tau Delta and the alumni

organization in Pittsburgh.

University officials will join with alumni undergraduates

to celebrate its founding.

Pitt’s Delt chapter was installed
in 1914 by incorporating the local
fraternity, Alpha Alpha, which was
organized in 1904. The Pitt chap-
ter has an alumni enrollment of
more than 700, most of whom are
still living in Western Pennsylva-
nia. '

Highlight of the anniversary
will be a banquet on Friday, Nov.
19, at the University Club. Chan-
cellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald will ex-
tend best wishes to‘the chapter on
behalf of the University.

Also participating will be promi-
nent Pitt Delt alumni including
Marcus A. Follansbee, president of
Follansbee Steel Corporation, who

.....

 

was a charter member of the Delt
Chapter at Pitt; and Congressman
Richard M. Simpson, vice chair-
man of the House Ways and Means
‘Committee, and former Pitt foot-

’ ball player.

Featured speaker at the ban-
quet will ,be Francis M. Hughs,
Indianapolis attorney, national
scholastic chairman of the frater-

'nity.

There will also be a lbuﬁet

luncheon for alumni at the Delt

chapter house prior to the Pitt-
