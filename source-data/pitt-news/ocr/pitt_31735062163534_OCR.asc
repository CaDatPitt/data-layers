‘K. still must be alert to the chain letter-savings bond fraud that
4 reached its peak "here in the last weeks of the fall trimester. ..
Though no new run on bonds has occurred, a new run »

couldbegin again at any time, warns John Callanen of the
student affairs oiﬁce at the University.

U.S. courts have ruled that theé

scheme is a lottery and as" such
is prohibited by law. Offenders
may be prosecuted. _

Issue Authorization

The Federal Reserve Board, re-
acting ‘to ' several ‘complaints re‘-'
ceived -from- member banks, . has.
issued. an .0f.ﬁ.cia.1.1ette.r.<>.f a.u.th°.ri-.
zation permitting banks to stop_
issuing Series E bonds whenever
a suspicious. situation’ arises. ‘ ' 0

What broke open the previous
run of bonds was a student try-
ing to buy a. great quantity of .
them at the Oakland branch of
Mellon Bank. The manager,
Earl C. Couch, shut off the
sale. '

The boy then went to the near-
by PNB office and tried to buy
the bonds but here too he was
thwarted by manager John Hust-
wit. Hustwit soon after contacted
the Federal Reserve Board and
received the authorization offi-
cially permitting banks to refuse
to issue bonds if they suspect any-
thing. _

Callanen reported that one stu-
dent had accumulated $2,000 in
bonds.

Good Gimmick

The scheme, which .Hustwit
A called a “pretty good gimmick,”
 ,is an old one. It was brought up

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Financial Aid Sought To Meet
Need Created By Tuitionllike  

University Expects $650,000 -
In Additional FederalLoan Funds

By "NANCY FUCHS

The amount of ﬁnancial aid available to students is expected
to increase by $747,000 to meet the need created by a tuition
raise, Lawrence L. Monnett, assistant chancellor of business
affairs, disclosed. "  .

Director of Student Aid, Jack B. Critchﬁeld, does‘ not anti-
cipate the percentage of. studen'ts applying for aid to deviate
from the normal annual increase of seven to ten percent." I

'‘‘Those who are in need of money now will still be in need
after the tuition goes up, and in the past, such a raise has not
resulted in that many ‘more requests for ﬁnancial help,” he
explained.’ “Between 38 and 40 percent of the undergraduates
receive some type of aid at present.”

, Loans Increased .

Increased funds in the form of federal - loans, senatorial

scholarships, and the new state loans contribute to the amount

, of aid to be made available to students next fall. Recent con-

gressional legislation has raised the ceiling of funds for National
Defense Student Loans from $275,000 to $800,000 per institution.
According to Monnett, the University should receive $650,000
federal aid in the form of such loans.

' Reﬂecting the increase in tuition, the value of State
Senatorial scholarships at the University will jump from
$247.50 to $350 per trimester for astudent carrying a mini-
mum of 15 credits, beginning in September. The amount has
been raised to $325 “for students carrying 14 credits. $300
for a 13 credit load, and $275 for 12 credits.

Critchﬁeld explained that the mechanics of the recently

passed state loans for education are being worked out in Harris-
burg now, and qualiﬁcations and "the process of applying for

_ such a loan will be publicized in late March or April. The loan

program will be in effect in September.
Reasons Explained 

Explaining the reasons behind the tuition ‘increase, Monnet‘

emphasized that tuition only covers two-thirds of instructional
costs, which only includes faculty salaries. Administrative ex-
penses, ‘supporting services, such as student activities and the
library which alone represents an annual expense of $800,000,
and the physical plant expenses, as well as the other one-third

of instructional costs are not covered by tuition. State aid, gifts '

to the University, and endowment income have to make up they

. difference.

_ A Instructional ‘costs have risen from $12,496,000 in the
ﬁscal year 1960-61 to $14,984,000 in the present ﬁscal year.
Income from students has increased from $8,442,000 to
$10,230,000 in the same amount of time. Monnet predicts
that next year's instructional costs will reach $16,500,000 with
tuition funds amounting to $12,500,000. _

“By design and purpose, the University has operated at a

deﬁcit in the past three years to build up a good faculty to meet’

the constant expansion of the student body _—— ‘Product develop-
ment,’ Chancellor Litchﬁeld calls it,” Monnet explained. “Within
three years we expect the University's income to exceed outgo,
but this will be accomplished byﬁnancial sources other than
tuition.” ' - A
Eight Months Work
' Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor of student and gen-
eral affairs, remarked that "the tuition raise represented eight
months work — “no hasty decision.” ‘

The Stadium Review is normally held on the

. first Friday in December.-The Penn State game,

postponed because of President Kennedy’s death,
meant a late ending for the football season. Con-
sequently, the stadium review was postponed

at the stadium during the football season.
“Irving Berlin's 75th Year,” “Hear That Dixie-
land Band,” “Music of Henry Macini” and
“Southern Holiday” are the titles of the ﬁeld
shows.

The annual bandsman of the year award will
be presented on stage at this point in the program.
The four runner-ups will receive nominee medals.
The bandsman of the year willtreceive a medal

, and an inscribed trophy as is tradition.

Various Instruments
Next on the program, 12 popular songs played
throughout the course of the season will be fea-
tured. Seven numbers are marches, each high-
lighting a special section of. the band — clarinets;

Best American ,
Plays

By MATTHEW NESVISKY .
Bargain-hunting theatre-lovers should.be delighted with
John Gassner’s latest anthology, Best American Plays: Fifth

"“ ”*’Series, 1958-1963 (Crown, Inc.,

678 pages, $5.95).

Gassner, Sterling Professor of Playwriting and Dramatic
Literature at Yale and a noted anthologist and critic has
selected 17 plays for the present collection and has supplied

a wise and witty introductory es-¢

say and head notes. He wins re-
spect immediately by not pre-
tending that recent American
drama is anything to be ‘ecstatical-
” — ly proud about; he admits frankly
., A that the best American writing
is not being done in script form.
His analysis of why the stage is
so bare is profound and convinc-
ing, although his term “period of
transition” probably can be held
up to debate. ‘
Best of the Last
Still and all, the volume does
present the best of the last half-
decade of Main Stern and off-
-r~~\ Broadway, and the plays them-
selves are almost always enter-
taining, occasionally even stimu-
lating. '

In general, the comedies are
more rewarding than the serious
plays in the colleciton, the op-
posite case ofmost- other forms
of" modern literature in this
country. Edward Albee’s Who’s
Afraidof Virginia Woolf? pro-
vides humor in its best forms,
being a meaningful social study
with equally meaningful humor
in the right places and handled
in the right _manner.

Herb Gardner’s A Thousand
Clowns, a very different sort of
comedy, is pure fun for fun’s
sake; the satire is slight here as
the humor is evoked by surprise
\ gags in a beautifully insane vein.
'* Situation Comedy
_,; Two for the Seesaw, by Wil-

liam Gibson, is an exteremely
funny situation comedy concern-
ing an impossible romance; and
it is additionally refreshing in

Tom Huck sought scientific excitement

Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.'E. degree on
C. T. Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Elec-
tric’s history of manufacturing development. He
realized, too, that our personnel development pro-
gram was expanding to meet tomorrow's demands.

After graduation, Tom immediately began to
work.on the development of electronic switching
systems. Then, in 1958, Tom went to the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories on a temporary assignment to
help in the advancement of our national military
capabilities. At their Whippany, New Jersey, labs,
Tom worked with the Western Electric develop-
ment team on computer circuitry for the Nike Zeus
guidance system. Tom then moved on to a new
assignment at-WE's Columbus, Ohio, Works. There,
Tom is working on the development of testing cir-

, In the middle of last term, this paper was the subject of a lengthy
and overly caustic appraisal by’ Miss Carol “Gussie” Smith, the vice-
president of Student Government. S

In her speech Miss Smith called The Pitt News an “ivory tower
through which little communication can" flow” and accused ‘members
of the editorialqstaff of possessing some hideous disease which substitutes
“hate” in place of blood in the circulatory system.

The accusations which Miss Smith leveled at that meeting are far
too numerous to mention in this small space, but let it suffice to say that
she left no stone unturned in her efforts to establish her contention that
this newspaper is a danger to the student body, the administration, and
SG.

In an interview conducted early the next week, Miss Smith ad-
mitted that her attack was-rather one-sided because “it had to be” in
order to gain the support she needed for the investigation of the paper
which, incidentally, isgstill in progress. _

It should be noted, however, that at no point in her speech did Miss
Smith refer to one of the common accusations ‘hurled at a great many

rather obvious.-No critic will ever compl/ain ’of'sensationalism when the
primary object of his criticism is to be sensational.

newspapers -— that of “sen'sationalism.” The ‘reason for this omission is"

. cushing cussie

Without checking on any of the facts of her accusations, she went
right ahead with her blistering assault. This was exactly the sort of tactics
which she accused The Pitt News of employing — shouting and then
checking the facts later. The fact that she did not investigate ﬁrst
before attacking does not indicate that she is inaccurate but rather that
she is a particularly astute politician, for as a former German politician
of the'World War II era once claimed: The bigger the lie the more people

' ‘ are apt to believe it.

What Miss Smith had to say wasn’t half so important as the
way she said it, and the reason for her ﬂamboyant drivel is becoming
more obvious as the year progresses. SG has lost much of the prestige it‘
enjoyed last year under more dynamic leadership, and Miss Smith was
seeking to reestablish the group as a force for good in the community
by taking on the “evil” Pitt News.

The only trouble with her approach is that it _is as obvious as a ham
sandwich, and no intelligent student can regard -her endeavors as any-
thing but foolish. . V

The Pitt News has therefore decided that in the interests of good
government it will conduct a thorough investigation of SG in an attempt
to discover if the group in questionis fulﬁlling its duties as the «governing

Twenty years
of heavy spend-
ing in the area of foreign aid
has worn the American public’s
patience thin. The average voter
cannot comprehend the full im-
portance foreign aid can have on
the future. John Q. Public likes
a dollar’s value for a dollar
spent, and he likes it immedi-
ately. If one believes that Con-
gress reflects popular opinion
accurately, the recent rumblings
over foreign aid which included
hostile comments even from
Senators Morris and Fullbright,
forecast what may be an omi-
nous period for U.S. foreign
policy and commitments.

The tragic loss of President

vKennedy will have its effects in
. this area, for while his place of

greatness in history is not yet
decided, his effort to lead the
American public into realizing
theimportance of better foreign
relations is undeniable. One can-
not be sure who our next presi-
dent- will be.’ Barry Goldwater
has tossed his hat into the ring,
and maybe a majority of Amer-
icans favor his conservative poli-
cies and talk—tough attitude.
Even if Goldwater fails" in his
bid for the presidency, it can-
not be denied that he represents
theviews held by a good many
Americans.

And there are millions more
who can be termed latent con-
servatives. They can be _push-
ed over the line toward con-
servative views by one more
set-back in Vietnam,’ or by
one more verbal assault by
General De Gaulle.

  200 Years Behind

And it is here that Fortress
America ties in. Conservatism is
probably the most important
variable in a_ choice between
adopting nationalism or interna-
tionalism, isolation or foreign
alliances. Add to this the fact
that at no time in history has the
U.S. been in a better position

to exist semi-autonomously than

now. A military withdrawal
from every foreign country

would not endanger American‘

territorial security. Our missile
bases overseas are practically
obsolete. SAC and long-range
ICBM’s are the real mainstay of
our territorial security.

How could we exist? Oil — we’
can get more than we need from
the Western Hemisphere. Food-
the worst thing that might hap-
pen is that we wouldlose a few
luxury items. Raw materials. —
present day technology would
allow us to adjust rapidly in
this area also. ‘

Most international observ-
ers would concede that a com-
munits takeover in most of
the Eastern Hemisphere‘ would
not terminate economic trade
with the West. Fortress Amer-
ica may sound preposterous. It
could not happen overnight..
But it is physically and logic-
ally possible. As foreign aid
‘ grows, -as our allies become
more independent and less
grateful, and as we suffer
more set-backs, ‘F o r t r e s s
America in the hands of a
popular an d opportunistic
politician could have a fan-
tastic appeal to a disillusioned
American public.

If Fortress America is feas-
ible, if it ,will save us money,
if it will not affect our daily
lives, then why not Fortress
America? There are compelling
reasons why not. First, we have
a moral commitment not to let
our allies and the lesser devel-
oped countriesfall prey to com-
munism. To some a moral com-
mitment may not seem binding,
especially, in international poli-
tics. Our moral commitment,
however, ‘is only partofia more
important reason for being

 Why Not Fortress America?

   

against Fortress America. A re-
turn to isolationism would be a
giant step backwards in nearly

two—hundred years of building
the liberal-.-democratic position
in America.

Internationalism, not na-
tionalism, is part of this evo-
'lution. Mutual V understanding
and friendship, not isolation-
ism and hostility are the in-

' gredients of a better world.

Technology has 0 enabled us to
exist independently, but it has
also brought the world closer
together.

The American conservative,
who is really a part of this tra-
dition, must not lose sight of

these facts. Isolationism is con-
trary to the principles the
United States stand for. The
easy way out is not always the
right way out." Tradition and

co_nscience,,these two facts alone,
should rule out Fortress Amer-
ica. But what should be and
what is are not always identical.

Let us hope that to all Americans
on this crucial issue they are
one and the same.

All} Welles Again. 

, Radio, heretofore little more than a non-stop
LP juke box, is getting smart. Radio drama has
returned to Pittsburgh" via the KQV air waves,
and it is a« great -comeback —’ especially for
motorists who haven't mastered
the art of driving and watch-,
ing television at the same time.

Billed ; as the “Alcoa 14
Theatre,”ﬁ the revived dramas
are heard Saturday and Sun-
day evenings on KQV. If it’s‘
not enough that this guarantees
that you won’t hear “The Surf-
ing Bird” for at least an hour,
the programs are real thrillers.‘

Alcoa, which ifoots the" bill
for the show, doesn’t interrupt‘ ‘
any of the tales with advertisements either. The
suspense is non-stop. -

Remember_Mr. and Mrs. North. Johnny Dollar.
Sam Spade. The Fat Man. Inner Sanictum. Sus-

pense. The Shadow. .

Some of those productions could really frighten
you. I remember how my brother and ‘I. used to
listen to these in our room at night. He even had
a string tied to one of thecloset doors and he’d
slowly, and creakily, open it afterwardwhen I’d
try to get some sleep. Or rather nightmares.

Now. KQV has the master, Orson Welles, nar-
rating tales of the Black Museum, and is also
broadcasting the Scarlet Pimpernel episodes.

The nightmarish quality of ‘the tales radio
always employed owed very little to the pictorial.
They were unsuitable for translation into movies.

I always enjoyed hearing Edgar Allan Poe

stories narrated on the radio rather than seeing ‘
themgvin the movies. = Poor old~Poe,‘ V-whose prose. -

the movie adaptations with their trashy paste-
board scenery.

Yet you always‘ had to struggle to wake from’

the bad dream of his hero’s doom after hearing a

radio adaptation. The . s t o r i e s didn’t require

exotic settings, wierd camera angles, and voices
echoing hollowly down improbable passageways.
Radio drama has retained its power to V’ thrill
us. Like the novel, it can make our ‘ﬂesh creep
because there are no wild beasts in sight. We
can’t pinpoint the villain. He‘ is what we‘ make
him, And God knows where he is when you’re

listening to the radio in a dark room.
A Most of the time, indeed, there is almost noth-

‘ ing to observe outside the hero’s mind. What can

the camera do when an author had -deliberately
left a setting blank? ’

1: -Vﬁrst ' came across KQV’s new radio drama‘
when Beano Cook, their.new sportscaster, and I

- were ‘I_notoring'back froma visit to Laurel Moun-
tains 3 ski resort. It was a long drive and music -

all the way isn’t always the thing." .

So we listened to Orson Wells spin a weird and
eerie tale. First came a few harsh orchestral
ﬂourishes of drums and trumpets in order to rouse
a spooky spirit. ‘ ,

“Pm glad Pm not. riding alone,” cracked
Beano. “Hell, I’d be scared to drive on.”

We ended up having to slow the car down so
we wouldn’t enter the Squirrel Hill tunnels before
the action had concluded. All someone would
have to do is go into a tunnel before they heard
the conclusion of one of these stories and KQV

would get bombarded .with letters to get those

damn radio dramas“ off the air. Hope. this doesn’t
happen‘. to y you.

Tuition Jump

(Continued from Page 1)

The lengthy process involves
the 0ﬂ’ic_e of Business Affairs

which gathers ﬁgures and sup-
plies history of costs, the budget
committee of the Faculty Sen-
ate, the Administrative Com-
mittee of the Chancellor and the
assistant and vice-chancellors,
the deans and the rest of the
faculty before the tuition pro-
posal must be ratiﬁed by the
Board of Trustees and put into
effect.

Tu_ition at the new regional
campuses at Bradford, Titusville,
and »'GreensburgI will remain at
$28 a credit because, according to
Monnet, “the local groups which
are sponsoring the regional cam-
puses for two years and assuming
the‘ risk of ﬁnancial loss, decided
to sustain the loss themselves
rather than ask the students to

‘pay higher tuition. There is no

increase in J ohnstown tuition to
keep it in line with the others.”

Flat Rate

The introduction of a ﬂat rate
of $700 a trimester including all
expenses except lab fees is “partly
a" trend and partly an attempt to
simplify the situation,” Monnet
remarked. It is easier for stu-
dents’ understanding and for the
business oﬁice to continue it.

Comparing the University’s
tuition to that of other colleges,
Rankin "stated that “tuition is
considerably lower than that of
the kind of institutions we com-
pete with. M.I.T., Cornell, and
Columbia University’s tuition
for 1964-5 is listed at $1700 for
two terms. ,

Harvard’s is $1760 and Brown
and Rochester University’s is 1800.
“We try not to get out of step
with our competition, Rankin ex-
plained. We try purposely to stay
‘at the lower tuition level.” '

It was later disclosed that the

he had been a gun dealer and
the guns were registered with

“They’re a p r e t t y ' eccentric

About the damage done by
the ﬁre, Felser disclosed that
two windows in the fraternity’s
quarters were shattered by the
heat, and a number of window
sills were charred. There also
was some damage done by

smoke, he noted. Extensive
damage was, wrought on the
other two buildings hit by the
ﬁre.

“The other fellows in the fra-
ternity stopped down or called
when they heard about the ﬁre,”
Felser related. -

Felser explained that he and
Olitzky reside in Apartment 300
in the building at 417 S. Craig,

and the apartment is used as an .-

E I recommend this after, viewing a public showing of the

House. The results were horrifying.

I ‘say this because seven of the_ﬁrst ten members of
‘ this year’s varsity are seniors and the

A will start for next season’s team is
enough to make even the most loyal
1 New York Met fan shudder.

The public showing was in the
form of a freshman-junior varsity
basketball game. The game was a pre-
liminary to the varsity’s game against
Dartmouth, which was only attend-
ed by 894 persons. A fraction of this
number attended the ﬁrst game, but
considering the attraction this was too
many. 1

    

BOB SMIZIK

‘lies. The junior varsity —- a group of varsity scrubs — repre-
sents the many recruiting mistakes Timmons has made since

A " he somehow came up with an outstanding team in 1960. These

_ players — Brian Generalovich, Dave Sauer, Cal Sheffield

,7 and Paul Kreiger — now form the nucleus of the present
A 1

varsity.
Since that ﬁne 1960 team Timmons has met with
little success in recruiting. Even freshman coach Carl
Peterson admitted as much. “We didn’t have what you’d
A call teams in 1961 and 1962, unless you’d call one or two
‘ players a team,” Peterson said.
Peterson must have had Daryle Ruby, Larry Szykowny

C and Bob Lovett in mind when he referred to “one or two

players.” These are the only players that have been of any
aid to the varsity from their respective frosh teams. ‘

_ ‘Not Real Sfandoufs

Yet these three, Lovett’s 26 points against Dartmouth

A not withstanding, are not the type of players you build a

. team around. They are the kind of players that ﬁll in around
a star. They are not the kind of players that will lead Pitt

A i‘ to victories against a big time basketball schedule.

Pitt is not getting this type of player. Timmons is not
doing a good job of recruiting. Where the problem lies is
hard to say. Pitt must have something to offer. John

t Michelosen has brought in the most sought-after players
in the state in recent years despite losing seasons. Rick
Leeson, Fred Mazurek and Eric Crabtree represent just
about the best Pennsylvania high schools had to offer
football-wise during the 1960-62 seasons. '

Timmons has been’ unable to attract the top-ﬂight basket-

ball players the way Michelosen has done in football. The
‘topbasketball players from this area are dispersed all over
the country. The two biggest names of the 1961-62 high
school basketball season, Jack Marin and Don Yates, are at

Duke and Minnesota, ‘respectively. Last year’s big names,

John Naponick and Ron Sepic, also got away. Naponick is

at Virginia and Sepic is at Ohio State.
But Timmons’ recruiting blunders are in the past. What

" kind of material is coming up to help Ruby, Lovett and

Szykowny next season?
Little Help From T961 Team
From last Thursday’s game there. appears to be little

,_,Ruby’s 1961 teammates — Bob Richardson, Bill McIntyre

and Brian Fisher -— have not shown the ability to make it
as varsity players. ,
No doubt some of them will be playing next season but

 V this only bids poor for that team.

Almost no help can be expected from .last year’s
‘ frosh, other than Szykowny and Lovett, since they were
the only two players brought in on scholarships. Nick
Generalovich and‘Ed Assid came out on their own, but
they fall into the Richardson-McIntyre category.
V This leaves only the present freshman team as the salva-
tion of next season’s varsity. Peterson calls it “my best team
since I had Generalovich, Sheffield, Kreiger and Sauer.”

But Peterson can be compared to the man who after not
eating for a week ﬁnds even the meagerest scrap of food a
delicacy. After having nothing for two years, Peterson is
excited’ over a little more than nothing.

Peterson touted Jim LaValley, Ray Pilarski and Stan
T Falenski as promising varsity candidates on this year’s frosh
team.

It’s hard to judge after one game, but if these three are
‘promising, they are promising in the same way that Lovett
and Szykowny are. They are the kind of playerswho ﬁll in
around a couple of truly outstanding players. They are the
kind of players who would be classiﬁed as bench strength
at schools like Cincinnati and Ohio State.

While Timmons has had success on the court recently,
he has been a loser off the court in the recruiting battles.
He has brought in three consecutive sub-par freshman teams
and the only outcome of such happenings is bound, to be

BOT) Timmons w a s ‘a . chief
reason for the loss to Illinois as
Bob Lovett was not able to con-
tain the Illini’s Skip Thoren.

“I think we would have won our

   

semi-ﬁnal game against Illinois if

Kriegerwas healthy,” said coach
Bob Timmons. I _

..The loss to Illinois was the
second of three suffered by the
Panthers over the holidays.
They started out poorly by los-
ing to Miami of Ohio,. 77-63.
Before a hometown , crowd at
Johnstown, Dave Roman scored
only ten points and was replaced
by Larry Szykowny. V

Szykowny also played in the
next four games, starting against
Michigan and Dartmouth. Tim-
mons said, “Roman has been hav-
ing trouble against a tight man
to man defense. I plan to use him
more against zone defenses" to
utilize his outside shooting.

“Szykowney is good on defense-
against a big guard like Gazzie
Russell of Michigan who is 6-feet-
5. He hasn’t hurt us so far and he
did score eight points against
Dartmouth.” _ '

The loss to Illinois was best ex-

pressed by guard John Larkin.
“We all knew we were better than
Illinois. We were just waiting to
catch up and take a big lead. But
they kept .the lead between three
and seven points and we never
did catch up,” said Larkin.
. The Panthers lost to Illinois,
83-76, after they had beaten
USC in the ﬁrst round, 82-72.
Aagainst the Trojans Pitt came
from 19 points behind in the
first half to gain the victory.

In the ﬁnal game of the tourna-
ment the Panthers lost to the then
number two team in the country,
Michigan, 95-80.. ’ I

Both Brian Generalovich‘ and
Cal Sheffield Thad outstand-
,ing tournaments. ' The General
scored 26, 26 and 30 points to
win a spot on the All-tourna-‘
ment team. Sheffield had 21,
22 and 23 points and played
well throughout the three games.

Last Thursday night at the Field
House the Panthers defeated Win-
less Dartmouth, 107-63. Sopho-
more Bob Lovett, ﬁlling in for the
still injured Paul Krieger, played
his ﬁnest game. He scored 26
points and had 14 rebounds. Both
were top marks in the contest.

Trouble F orMatmen 

By FRANK SIVIIZIK

Wrestling coach Rex Peery will have to make more
moves than Charles 0. Finley as he faces the problem of who
to put where when the wrestlers meet Syracuse at Fitzgerald
Field House Saturday, at 3:00 p.m. .

Injuries and ineligibility are forcing Peery to juggle his
lineup against last year’s Eastern champs.

Peery’s probable starting line-
up ‘shows Duff ‘Killian, 123, Mike
Johnson 130, Clair Riley-137, Dino
Boni 147, Frank O’Korn or Boni
157, Tom Baily or O’Korn 167,
Lee Hall 177, Don Caslow 191, and
Bill Solominsky, heavyweight.

The only possible changes in
the lineup may be Dave Clery'
at 137 and John Carr, 157. Both
are in academic trouble, but still
may have a. chance to become
eligible for the season.

The ironic thing about the Pan-
ther line-up is that O’Korn and
Bailey are 137 pounders wrestl-
ing in the 157 and "167 pound
weight class. Caslow is _a 137-
pounder wrestling at 191 and So-

lominsky a 147-pounder wrestl—-

ing heavyweight, where he meets
NCAA champ Jim Nance.

This is necessitated by the in-
eligibility of Tim Gay, who ﬁn-
ished sixth in the NCAA Tourna-
ment at'157 pounds, Lee Britton
Chuck Samonsky, and Bill Bu-
chanan who are all deﬁnitely out
for the remainder of the season.

These problems have given
Peery a doubly tough job
against a powerful Orange squad
that has lost only two wrestlers
from their undefeated squad of
last year.‘

' ’The Panthers on the other hand
have. lost Jim Harrison, Eastern
and NCAA champion at 167-
pounds. Ken Barr, who is re-
covering from agknee injury and
is doubtful for the Syracus‘e
match, was Eastern runner-up at

177 pounds and he also took ﬁfth‘ '

place in the NCAA championships.

vMike Johnson, Eastern a n d
NCAA . runner-up, ‘ a n d Frank

‘O’Korn, who took third in the

Easterns last year, are deﬁnite
starters on Saturday.

, All was not bleak for Peery,
though, as his freshmen
went to Wilkes Barre, Pennsyl-
vania, _for the Wilkes Tourna-
ment. Colleges, athletic clubs.
and independents are all rep-
resented in the tournament.
George Radman performed the
best for the frosh as he took a
third in the 157 pound class. Cliff
Zolikoff was 3-2 in the 147—pound
class, while. Terry Sulivan was
2-2 at 123-pounds. Other fresh-
men who represented the Pan-
thers were ,Al Traunsteiner, Rich
Rodgers and Carl Rotter.

IM Basketball
Play Begins
In Two Weeks

Leo Bemis, director of in-
tramural sports, says the 1964
intramural basketball season
will begin the second or third
week of January and end
about the same time in
March. There will be astaggered
start because, “the fraternities
and dorms have track, swimming
and wrestling_ to complete and the
Dental School has tests until Jan-
uary 20th.

“I expect to have between 40 to
50 teams,” said Bemis. He fore-
sees 7 teams each.in the Dorm,
Dental School, and Engineering
leagues and 15 each in the Fra-
ternity and Independent leagues.

_Heading the entries are defend-
ing Fraternity A and "VB league
champs, Delta Sigma, Phi and Phi
Kappa Alpha and last year’s over-
all champs from the Dental School.

-Bemis said, “The big change
this year will be in the time games
will be scheduled.” “There will
be 3 ﬂoors available at 4:00" and
this will avoid evening games.”

Bemis. hopes thisfeature ofitlie

P1'0gram will “apeal to the com-

muting student” and increase the"
registration of independent teams.
Bemis [ sees a good competitive
league since “three of last year’s
champs are entered and the new
schedule for games exists.”

 

Syracuse Selects
Five Panthers
On All-Foe Squad

The Syracuseisfootball team, a
35-217' loser to the Panther grid-

ders, selected ﬁve members of-

John Michelosen’s squad on its
all-opponent team.-

.Tackles Ernie Borghetti ‘and’

John Maczuzak, guard Ed Adam-
chik, quarterback Fred Mazurek
and’ halfback Paul Martha were
all honored by _the Orange.
Mazurek, who picked up 255.
yards, in total offense against

Syracuse, was named top all-. ‘

around performer by .a wide
margin. Mazurek won this
honor. even though two all-

Americas, Martha and Kansas,’

Gale Sayers, also were picked

in the backﬁeld. ,

Adamchik was the lone‘ repeat-
er from the 1962 Orange all-op-'
ponent - team.‘ ' ' ,

Three other Panthers made the
second team. They were ‘end Joe
Kuzneski, halfback Bill Bodle and
fullback Rick Leeson.

Maczuzak, Borghetti and "Mar-
tha also made the West Virginia
all-opponent team along with
Leeson. It was the second time
that Martha was honored by the
Mountaineers. The ﬂashy halfback
raced 55 yards for a score to erase
a West Virginia lead and bring
the Panthers on to victory.‘

Navy quarterback R o g e r
Staubach received every vote
but one at the quarterback posi-

 tion with the lone dissenter vot-

ing. for Fred Mazurek.
Notre Dame c h o s e Borghetti

and Martha on its all opponent

team. Martha was in some ex-
clusive company in the backﬁeld
as the Irish also chose Roger Stau-
bach and Pat Donnelly of Navy
and Sherman Lewis of Michigan
State.

The Panthers will announce
their all-opponent team later this

week. /

Freshman Basketball Team
At Slippery Rock Tomorrow

The Panther freshman basketball team will try to go over the
.500 mark for the ﬁrst time in the young season when_ they meet
a tough Slippery Rock team on the enemy’s court tomorrow night.

Coach Carl Peterson believes this will be a true test for the
Cubs. “Slippery Rock will be ﬁelding, a junior varsity team, and

- they have the experience our boys lack. And experience is a

great teacher.”
Peterson was well pleased with last Saturday's 93-85 vic-
tory over Johnstown. Johnstown’s ﬂoor is smaller than most,
and Peterson was pleased with the way the team adapted
itself to the unusual playing conditions.

The victory over Johnstown was a good all around team
"effort. Three starters, Jody Adams, Bill McNally, and Stan
Falenski, scored 20 points or better. Falenski led all scorers with
22 points. Two other standouts in the Johnstown game were
6-feet-61/2 center Jim Lavalley, and Bob Caldwell.

Peterson was impressed ‘with Lavalley’s rebounding and
scoring. Caldwell,‘ who played ,his high school ball at nearby
Avonworth, impressed Peterson" with his defense, ﬂoor game
and team work.

The Cubs’ only loss this season came at the hands of
the Panther junior varsity on last Thursday. The score was
88-73. Peterson commented that the team’s showing was ex-
cellent eventhough they lost. “I think the team worked well
together against a. far more experienced junior varsity. We
just ran out of gas at the end.”

Peterson commented that he welcomed the rough schedule
because it will give the freshman team the experience they.need.
He is not looking ahead to any speciﬁc game, however. “We will
play them one at a time.”

Robert Preston Is No Con-Man
In "All The Way Home"

Robert Preston has played two generations of con-men in his
last two pictures, the turn-of-the-century “The Music Man” and
the contemporary “Not On Your Life.” This sort of casting could
become a kind of happy rut,_ but Preston has decided on a change of
pace by accepting the dramatic role of the father in David Susskind’s
production of “All The Way Home,” which is now, showing at the

 

SEVEN-YEAR OLD .
MAKES DEBUT Ill

.' ALHHE WAY HOME"

Michael Kearney, a Verona.
New Jersey resident who will
soon be eight years old —— is
making his motion picture debut
in the leading role of Rufus in
David Susskind’s production “All
The Way Home” that stars
Robert Preston and Jean Simmons
and is now showing at the Guild
Theatre in Squirrel Hill.

The eldest child of a New Jer-
sey cement—truck driver, Michael
will portray the son of_ Miss
Simmons and Mr. Preston in the
screen adaption of James Agee’s

Pulitzer Prize-winning autobi-
ographical novel, “A Death In
The Family.”

The blond, blue-eyed young-
ster who has never acted profes-
sionally before, was awarded the
starring role after director Alex
Segal interviewed and screen
tested close to 600 boys from 16
states.

Now a Third-Grader in the
Verona School System, Michael
had a special tutor while work-
ing on the ﬁlm. He is a good stu-
dent and graduated from the ﬁrst
grade with an average of 97.8
pct. He has a brother, Mark—
age six and a sister, Ei1een—age
two.

“All The Way Home” was ﬁlm-
ed on location in Knoxville, Ten-
nessee and includes in its cast Pat
Hingle and Aline MacMahon.

In his portrayal of Jay Follet,
Preston is the antithesis of his last
screen roles. Jay is a strong man
of sterling character—good, com-
passionate and honest in every
respect. The character is, of
course, based on the father of the
late James Agee, whose Pulitzer
P r i z e-winning autobiographical
novel, “A Death in the Family,”
is the basis for Tad Mosel’s stage
triumph, “All The Way Home,”
and current ﬁlm version.

Preston’s appearance in ‘‘All
The Way Home” marks a high
point in a career that has been
generously studded with triumphs
on both stage and screen. He is
perhaps most grateful for the
character he played in “The
Music Man” on Broadway and
again in the ﬁlm. Up to the mo-
ment he stepped on stage, Pres-
ton had never danced or sung in
public. But barely ﬁve minutes
after the curtain rose on opening
night, the critics and the audi-
ence knew that one of the most
exciting events in theatrical his-
'€0I‘Y_was taking place. ,

H15 phenomenal success for over

two years on Broadway in “The.

Music Man” was the culmination
of ﬁrm personal resolve. In 1951,
Preston left Hollywood for the
Broadway stage, after starring in
a dozen ﬁlms in which he invar-
iably played the “heavy.” In New
York, he replaced Jose Ferrer in
“Twentieth Century.” Thereafter
his services on the stage were so
much in demand that he had time
for only a few ﬁlms and none at
all between 1954 and 1961. Among
his stage successes are “The Male
Animal,” “The Tender Trap,”
“Janus” and “Men of Distinction.”

.Prestons ﬁrst important movie
role was as Barbara Stanwyck’s
husband in DeMil1e’s ‘.‘Union Pa-
ciﬁc.” For the next 13 years, if
there was a herd to be stamped-
ed, a maiden’s virtue to be
threatened or sundry other vil-
lainous deeds to be performed,
producers automatically called for
Preston. Among his many motion
pictures are “Reap the Wild
Wind,” “The Macomber Affair,”
“Beau Geste,” “Northwest Mount-
ed Police,” “Wild Harvest,”
“Whispering Smith" __and “Moon
Over Burma.”
