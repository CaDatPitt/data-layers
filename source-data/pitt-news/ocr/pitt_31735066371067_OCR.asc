Honors college proposal under scrutiny by deans

By Kathy Stahl
The Pitt News .
From their tiny quarters on the 35th

ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning,
members of Pitt’s honors program

await a decision on their proposal to t

establish an honors college.

Alec Stewart, honors program direc-
tor, said he is excited about the pros-
pect of expanding the honors program.
Stewart emphasized that the honors
program will remain the central core
of the honors college, with a few
changes being made to bring universi-
ty resources to the undergraduate level.

“There is a vacuum,” Stewart said.

“There needs to be intellectual in-
dependence, or rather, upper-level
undergraduate independent scholar-
ship.”

The college will be open to all
students. Admissions for candidacy for
an honors college degree will be the
same as those under the present honors
program. Ordinarily, students should
have a 3.25 QPA, but all students who
are serious about the program are urged
to talk with the honors college advis-
ing staff.

The new college will offer two new
options for special degrees. The pro-
posed degrees would be awarded joint-
ly between a student’s “home” college

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

and the honors college, if the student
fulfills the requirements of both
schools. Students will earn the honors
degree by either completing a thesis or
an examination.

“This would be unique,” said
Stewart. “As far as I know, there are
no longer colleges in the country cur-
rently granting honors degrees.”

The idea of establishing an honors
college came from a faculty suggestion
as part of a Phase I planning report on
the university honors program. In
response to the suggestion, Provost
Roger Benjamin requested that Stewart
subrnita proposal to him that would ex-
amine the feasibility of an honors

New joint health degree offered

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

The implementation of the Joint
Degree Program in the Health Records
Administration and Health Services
Administration has been approved by
Provost Roger Benjamin, in a
memorandum to Deans Jerome L.
Martin and Raymond Seltser.

“Given the growing need on the part
of the health care organizations, par-
ticularly those who derive their
revenues from third-party reimburse-
ment organizations,” Benjamin stated
in the memorandum, “you and your
colleagues Drs. Elizabeth B. Anderson
and Trevor Sainsbury are to be com-
mended for the design of the program
to train specialists to analyze health
records to determine the ap-
propriateness of services provided and
the legitimacy and amount of reim-
bursement. ”

The Joint Degree Program will per-
mit interested students to earn a
bachelor of science degree in Health
Records Administration and a masters
degree in Health Services Administra-
tion in five years, reducing the amount
of schooling by a year. ‘

“It’s as natural combination,” com-

  

mented Anderson. Since the informa-
tion contained in the health record
emanates from all diagnostic and
therapeutic departments of the health
care organization, health record ad-
ministrators are in an excellent position
to observe, interact and analyze the
details of the operations of these depart-
ments, she continued. The Joint Degree
Program builds on the generic manage-
ment courses already included in the
Health Records Administration cur-
riculum and provides an opportunity
for students with management career
objectives to receive additional and
more advanced management education.

Another reason which Anderson said
makes the Joint Degree Program ad-
vantageous to the university is that “the
program is not using any additional
resources. It uses courses and faculty
already existing in the School of Health
Related Professions and the Graduate
School of Public Health and therefore
is not costing Pitt one cent of extra
money.”

The program was originally ap-
proved in June 1984, but its implemen-
tation was delayed until the -results of
the university’s planning process were
approved by- the board of trustees.

Between the time of the program’s

.i ;g-',..

 

original approval and the Provost’s
memorandum, a few curriculum
changes were made. “We had to iron
out the changes so the curriculums
would mesh," said Anderson.

This Joint Degree Program will be
enacted in the winter term (1986) with
those juniors already enrolled in SHRP
being eligible. “The seniors currently
enrolled in SHRP are too far along for
this program,” said Anderson.
However, Dr. Sainsbury will work out
a curriculum with the seniors so that
they will be eligible.” She also said that
the new program, with the present
faculty, has room for 25 juniors and 25
seniors.

There does seem to be an enthusiasm
for this program, said Anderson,
because “when students learned of the
program, they began pestering the
faculty as to when it was going to
begin.” *

The Joint Degree Program is unique
to the university because “no other
medical records program has such a
thing,” said Anderson. The new
degree may or may not attract more
students to the university. However,
Anderson said .she feels “it might

'change the complexion of the

students. ’ ’

college.

Stewart chaired a faculty committee
(the Honors College Study Committee)
which, over a course of six months,
formulated a Planning and Resource
Management System document.

Benjamin received the ﬁnalized
document this past September. The
PRMS proposal was distributed to the
undergraduate deans with the stipula-
tion that appropriate faculty councils
review the proposal and provide writ-'
ten comments to Benjamin by Jan. 17,
1986.

The total projection cost for
organization and staffing of the honors

college is based on additions to the cur-

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, I985

rent operating budget, which is

-$17,500.

The new proposal’s total costs over
the next five years are estimated to be
about $235,000. According to Arlene
Seal, the assistant director of Pitt’s
honors program, at a recent National
Collegiate Honors Council, it was
stated that honors programs are being
established all over the country.

“We are asking for an amount now
that was an average request in 1978,”
said Seals. “Other schools are now
asking for much more.”

‘Starwars’ assailed
by defense expert

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

The Reagan administration’s so-called
Star Wars program is an offensive
weapons system “disguised as defen-
sive” and threatens to bring us ever
closer to war with the Soviet Union, ac-
cording to retired Lt. Col. Robert M.
Bowman. . '

“The mission of Star Wars is to seize
military control of the high ground of
space.  Even the attempt to put up a
space defense system would get us into
World War III," Bowman said.

Bowman’s lecture on the SDI program
last Wednesday was extremely critical
and somewhat technical, but his message
was clear: “The only believable, so-
called defensive use of a Star Wars
system is in the hands of an aggressor,
to protect him from retaliation from the
few missiles he missed in a first strike.”

In. 1978, Bowman retired from the Air
Force after 22 years of service. With a
Ph.D. in aeronautics and nuclear

engineering, Bowman was director of A

space research programs for the Air
Force and currently chairs the Institute
for Space and Security Studies which he
founded.

Bowman tried to explain the concept
of an actual space defense system with
anecdotes, noting one colleague who
“has invented a very effective means of
boost-phase [immediate post—launch] in-
tercept. It consists of a machine gun
manned by a red-blooded American

soldier standing next to every missile silo
in the Soviet Union." _

In a similar way, Bowman explained
that a space system serving the same pur-

pose would be analogous to a machi_n_e _ "i  ._
gunner atop the Empire State Building ' “ ‘

shooting at tennis balls in England.
These anecdotes didn’t belie Bowman’s
true grasp of the technicalities of a space

weapons system. Much of his lecture was '

devoted to explaining the various com-
ponents of such a system, the immense
technology involved and the theories
behind them. And as a military man,

Bowman felt compelled to emphasize the A

inadequacy and vulnerability of proposals
as they exist today.

Bowman commented, “All that’s

necessary to undermine an entire system
is to disable one critical element inthe
body of the system.” That includes the
sensitive electronics network, the adjunct
observation systems or the communica-
tions web — what Bowman called the
“brain, eyes and spine” of Star Wars.
“Even if everything worked as advertis-
ed,” Bowman said, “we would still have
a system that would be able to intercept
somewhere between zero and 10 percent

of nuclear weapons directed against us.” V

In closing, Bowman remarked that he
saw the Geneva summit as a failure
because Reagan refused to use Star Wars
as a bargaining chip to initiate significant
arms reduction. “He would have made
the ﬁrst great step down the road to disar-
mament and really put an end to the arms
race,” Bowman said, “but he didn’t do
it.”

The demand for interpreters and
translators is increasing rapidly. That’s
the opinion of Harry Obst, director of
the State Department’s Office of
Language Services.

Obst, who spoke Tuesday in the
William Pitt Union, stated that inter-
preters and translators in his depart-
ment start at a salary of about $26,000
and generally have a good chance for
advancement.

“Promotions in the ‘early stages are
rapid,” he said. “If you’re good,
you’re going to make money.  If you
have the aptitude, check out [the] op-

“We wouldn’t have dreamed of
scheduling a program on Christmas day
itself,” commented Jean Thomas, pro-
gram director for the—Dear Friends.
“But it was not uncommon in the last
century to have a famous concert art-
ist or touring opera company give a
Dec. 25 program and draw a large
crowd. Ole Bull, the famous Swedish
violinist, played a Christmas concert in
Pittsburgh in 1852, and the opera Bohe-
mian Gift was performed at Masonic
Hall downtown on Christmas after-
noon, 1863.”

many upper-echelon personnel earn as
much as $70,000.

Obst also acknowledged the
availability of translation and inter-
preting positions in business. “We are
finally to the point where private enter-
prise recognizes the importance of
foreign languages.”

Obst urged those interested in pur-
suing a career in the international realm
to obtain as broad and diverse an
educational background as possible. He
cited several instances where otherwise
competent translators and interpreters
were not hired by his office because
they were ignorant of basic geographic,
political and cultural facts. “The more
general knowledge you have,” he

Thomas explained that there was less
emphasis on Christmas carols, or even
secular Christmas songs. The Dear
Friends are basing this year’s program
on descriptions from nineteenth century
household magazines. “We found
detailed instructions for mounting a
parlor Christmas pageant that included
musical excerpts from Bizet’s Carmen
and Wagner’s Taunhauser as well as
songs like ‘Believe Me If All Those
Endearing Young Charms,’ ” Thomas
said. “Our program recreates the at-

The Pitt News, December 6, 1985

Demand for interpreters increases

remarked, “the better the translator or
interpreter you’ll be. ’ ’

Interpreters, the director said, often
reap “rewards which are not only
monetary.” Interpreting, Obst said,
“sometimes leads to other careers.”

What’s more, he said. he sees a cer-

tain degree ofjob stabilityh in the pro- 2

fession. “Presidential administrations
come and go; interpreters stay,” Obst
commented.

Obst said he forsees that international
relations will, in the future, become in-
creasingly more important to both the
U.S. government and corporations. He
urges Americans to learn more of
foreign lands, “so to learn about other
cultures, we must first get the key —
foreign language.”

Group re-creates parlor Christmas

Day, with its myriad activities of_ story-
telling, pantomimes, games, singing

The Dear Friends, an ensemble
specializing in American music, will
present their annual Victorian
Christmas program at the Stephen
Foster Memorial at the University of
Pittsburgh on Sunday, Dec. 8, 2:30
p.m.

It will portray the festivities that
would have been part of a typical parlor

or drawing room Christmas party over

100 years ago.

Honors college

continued from page 1

next ﬁve years includes $185,624 for
personnel, which will cover a clean,
four advisers, two assistant directors,
a project supervisor, an administrative
secretary and a clerk-typist, and
$94,000 for one-time expenditures
which include a data-base management
system, office equipment, furnishings
and additional space.

The need for additional space is due
to the growth of the honors program
from 100 students to over 650.

Stewart and Seals emphasized that
regardless of the honors college, addi-
tional money would have been needed
to keep the honors program going.

“We [the university] believe that
priority should by given to athletics,”
Stewart stated sarcastically. “It’s about
time that priority was given to
academic achievement. ”

Fred Koloc, of the CAS advising
center, said he would also like to see
more emphasis placed on academic
achievement and programs for the
students. “I wish that all of the various
programs could get money for
academic fundings,” said Koloc. “At
least the honors college is geared for
students.”

The proponents of the honors college

(UPI) — U.S. government ofﬁcials
have reported that Israeli covert activity
may be more extensive than previous-
ly believed. The Jonathon Pollard case,
in which a U.S. Navy employee was
charged with spying for Israel, has
drawn public and ofﬁcial attention to
Israeli intelligence activity in the
United States. One ofﬁcial said both the
Justice Department and the Central In-
telligence Agency are currently work-
ing on evidence that Pollard was not
the only person to be passing classiﬁed
information to the Israelis.

Israeli ofﬁcials made no comment on
the allegations yesterday. State Depart-
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb said,

said they do not feel there will be a ma-
jor increase in the number of students
who enroll in the program.

“Although there are only a few
students who will opt for an honors
degree, I feel that it improves all of our
degrees,” said Seals.

The PRMS proposal also states that
the visibility of an honors college will
enhance the reputation of the univer-
sity. “My fondest hope,” said Stewart,
“is that it will attract a large endow-
ment, between $3 and $15 million,
three quarters of which would be for
the use of scholarships.”

Stewart is now waiting for the ad-
ministration to respond to the proposal.
“So far everyone has beenfairly sup-
portive of the honors college,” Stewart
said. “But the proposal is moving
slowly for the time that it’s been out.
It’s unfortunate for the students.”

John Bolvin, the dean of the College
of General Studies, said the [CGS]
faculty council is presently reviewing
the honors college proposal. “I feel
positively about the proposal,” said
Bolvin. When asked about the involve-
ment of students in CGS, Bolvin said
that there are not that many involved.
“We have outstanding students,
though,” said Bolvin. “As they build

Israeli spying increases

‘ ‘N 0 one in the State Department who’s
informed on the subject has that sort
of information.”

Any such espionage activity by Israel i

would violate existing U.S. law as well
as an exclusive written agreement bet-
ween the two countries signed in 1981.
The agreement includes the exchange
of intelligence material and binds each
party to a promise not to conduct secret
operations against the other.

Administration ofﬁcials said yester— V

day that one indication of further Israeli
spy operations is the Israeli’s recent of-
fer to close down the ofﬁces of its
science attaches in Washington, New
York, Boston and Los Angeles.

 

the program they should remember to
build it for all students."

Jerome Martin, dean of the School
of Health Related Professions, said in-
volvement of students in health related
professions was limited regarding the
honors program.

“ We only have juniors and seniors,
and their programs are generally so full
that they have little leeway to take other
courses,” said Martin. “That may
change, though, because of reconstruc-
tion being done within the school.”

Martin summed up the feeling of
many proponents of the honors college:
“It will enhance the reputation of the
school, attract highly qualiﬁed students
and provide students with the oppor-
tunity to excel.”

Chem student honored I

Marcus A. Pelucio of North Huntingdon, PA, received the Silverman
Award from the University of Pittsburgh recently.

The award is presented to an outstanding junior who has expressed an
interest in chemistry as a profession. Pelucio’s prize includes a student
affiliate membership in the American Chemistry Society and a year’s
subscription to a technical journal of his choice.

Pelucio is a member of many honor societies, including Phi Eta Sigma,
Alpha Epsilon Delta, Druids, Omicron Delta Kappa and Mortar Board.
He is president of Lambda Sigma, Pitt’s sophomore leadership and com-
munity service organization which was recently certiﬁed as an “Honors
Chapter.” Pelucio has served as student coordinator of Pitt’s Mentor pro-
gram and as a volunteer for Presbyterian-University Hospital, the travel-
ing Nursing Care Service and the Hand-in- I-land Festival. He plans to
pursue a career in chemistry or medicine.

Regan’s Triumph

President Reagan’s appointment of Vice Ad-
rniral John M. Poindexter as his national security
adviser is a clear indication that Chief of Staff

Donald T. Regan’s ascent to power over the -

domestic and foreign policy apparatus is no
longer a point of contention. The resignation of
Robert C. McFarlane, and his replacement by
Poindexter, who promises to be far less asser-
tive than his predecessor, will allow Regan --
who already exercises an inordinate degree of
inﬂuence over domestic issues — to play a much
greater role in foreign policy matters.

. The resignation of Col. McFarlane leaves
Regan as the only high—level ofﬁcial in the White
House with an independent power base. At pres-
ent, most other White House officials are in
some way indebted to Regan for their posts. As
a result of Regan’s efforts, there is now a decid-
ed absence of strong-willed, independent
thinkers in the White House.

The absence of challenge to Regan’s views
bodes ill for US. policy considerations.
McFarlane’s departure means that Secretary of
State George P. Shultz will have to face such
hard—liners as Secretary of Defense Caspar W.
Weinberger alone. Furthermore, the kinds of
debate and confrontation that are essential to a
comprehensive study of each policy issue will
be conspicuously absent from White House staff
deliberations. .

Regan has removed the last obstacle to pro-
viding for what President Reagan has referred
to as ‘ ‘continuity” in U.S. policy — but at what
cost? If nothing worse, it is likely that this ar-
rangement will guarantee that U.S. policy will
not deviate from its shortsighted, reactionary
mold.

Abortion ,
Unpalatable

Some recent letters to the editor have
complained that the Nov. 20 anti-
abortion cartoon was offensive and
tasteless. This comes as no surprise.

Grim realities are made more
palatable when dressed in innocuous
verbiage. The pro—abortion literature is
rife with euphemisms for abortion such
as temiinating pregnancies, evacuating
the womb, or excising the post-
conceptual tissue. Sterile phrases of this
sort mask the dark side of abortion that
the cartoon in question brings to our
attention. Every abortion ends with a
human life tossed on the trash heap.

Abortion advocates don’t like to be
reminded of that and especially don’t
like the public to be reminded of that.
Pictures documenting brutally
dismembered and chemically burned
victims of abortion, while constituting
important information to anyone mak-
ing .an “informed choice,” are
guaranteed to evoke indignant outcries
and demands for their withdrawal from
the pro-abortion movement. Pro-
abortionists themselves cannot endure
the evidence of their policies; they can
only avert their eyes.

It must be born in mind that the car-
toon showed nothing so graphic as an
abortion victim. It presented a trash can
and a verse reminding us that a human
life ended there.

It appears even this reminder proved
too strong for the pro-abortion con-
science to stomach.

Penchant
for Accuracy

In response to the letter by Christine
Biancheria, I would like to say that I
trusted the misspelling of “umbrage”
would be .-orrected by the proofreader.

There is not really a “mist of con-
troversy as to whether Shakespeare was
gay" except in the eyes of homosex-
uals. You and others of your bias are
simply attempting to attain the

penultimate cultural weight of

Shakespeare due to your own anxiety.
You would probably go over

Shakespeare’s head and right to the Bi-

ble if the word of God was not alltoo
clear!

I am quite aware that a lot of coward-
ly homosexuals marry for both social
and economic reasons.

You accused me of being “pom-

pous," “over-reactionary” and “a bit‘

Letters to the Editor

excessive” — I would have to say that
yes, I am that way!

As for my generosity in allowing that
homosexuals number good and great
artists among them, I must stress that
it was not my generosity — it was my
penchant for accuracy! From
Michaelangelo through Rimbaud, to
T.E. Lawrence and Witold Gom-
browicz — there have been a surfeit of
astonishing, homosexual artists.

As for your rejoinder, “The lady
doth protest too much, methinks,” I
can only write that you areagain inac-
curate. I am no lady, and due to the fact
that I am “pompous,” “over-
reactionary” and “a bit excessive,” it
should be understood that too much is
just enough for me!

If you wish to put me down —— it
would be more accurate to quote Franz
Kaﬂ<a: “There are no idols more
devouring than these ﬁlthy goblins
made of beer, spittle and newsprint.”

I am writing this letter to allay any
misconception that Pitt’s football team is
the only part of Pitt’s athletic program
which is outclassed by Penn State.

Three weeks ago I journeyed to Penn
State to watch Penn State humble Notre
Dame. Although Penn State played
before a sold—out house, amazingly
everyone who bought a ticket had a seat.
This fact is especially interesting in light
of the ﬁasco that went on at Pitt Stadium
last Saturday night.

I purchased a season ticket with the

I mistaken belief that it would get me into
all the games. Upon arriving at the

stadium 30 minutes before the game, I
was confronted with an angry horde of

. students congregated around one of the

student ticket gates. This crowd extend-
ed almost to the fence which borders the
road surrounding the stadium. A conser-
vative estimate would number this mass,
along with similar masses at the other stu-
dent ticket gates, at 2,000. They were
angry because they were all laboring
under the same mistaken belief that I was:
one ticket to a seat. Fifteen minutes into
the game, I, along with some friends,
gave up and went home to watch the
game on TV.

I blame neither the ticket takers nor the
security guards for the overcrowded con-
ditions. The blame falls squarely on the
shoulders of the Athletic Department.
Although I appreciate the fact that the
football team had poor attendance
ﬁgures, I don’t think it is fair to oversell
the student section merely to make a
buck. While I realize Pitt had launched
numerous promotions in an attempt to in-
crease gate receipts, I don’t think the
screw-the-students plan is the most ethical
way to achieve the desired results.

Not only should the Athletic Depart-

not get in, but I also think a written

apology would be appropriate.

Date Rape

I was very much disturbed by the
tone of Marilyn McNeal’s Nov. 20 ar-
ticle on date rape. While it must cer-
tainly not be ignored, I have trouble ac-
cepting the notion that men are solely
to blame. As a former Pitt student and
fraternity brother, I would have some
idea of what goes on and I’ve known
my share of “wolves,” but it is clear
to me that attitudes on both sides have
to change if the problem is ever going
to be solved.

What am I talking about? My ex-

_ perience tells me that most college-age

women are awfully choosy concerning
whom they go out with, as if they too
are “looking” for something (not
necessarily sex).

A consequence of such “exclusive”
dating is that a guy may get the idea
that since a particular girl is even out
with him, she really likes him and thus
may be ‘‘willing’’ to have sex with
him. This, of course, is not an excuse
to take advantage of her, but it is a
possibility that must be considered.

Are there any solutions to the prob-
lem of date rape? Well, I’ve found that
the best dates I ever had were with
women I knew quite well; two of the
girls I took out for the first time this
fall I’ve know since September — of
1983! Maybe men and women ought
to get to know each other as friends
first, and then the “games” that hurt
people won’t need to be played. Idon’t
think too many guys would force
themselves on someone they consider
to be a friend.

tie’

By .Matthew Yokobosky, Michael Fay
and George Kresak with advice on
fashion from Victoria Powell

A sign outside read “Mon — Wave”.

every Monday night a few months
back. Then it progressed to “Wed -

Wave,” which sounds like a quotation‘

from Barbara Walter’s diary. And on
Nov. 30, 1985 the excitement ex-
tended to yet another night, “Sat —
Wave.” '

New Wave, or what has been
termed an alternative to your listening
pleasure, has become a major enter-
tainment venture in this city which has
always had its watch set five years
behind the times. So while many sit
home and enjoy their Music Television,

A weeping and waiting to see their

favorite music sensations, the chic of
Oakland are playing out their own ver-
sion of “A Night at the Pa|adium.”
The Upstage appears to be a regular
Oakland establishment from the out-
side, with its own plastic signs and
distasteful logo, but what makes this
place a Waver’s heaven is its music

 All the world’s a stage 

entry, and upon shelling out a dollar
admission fee, you become entitled to
two free beers and an evening of
musical delights which harbor preten-
tionsof being a Vogue version of
“Flock over London.”

While cheap beer in quantity is a
sparkling attraction to many college
fluffs, the real attraction at Upstage is
its glistening clientele. People spend
hours composing their most daring
and outrageous rags to be ‘members
of the social elite, but while it is an art
to outrage this deviant clan of in-
novators, the charm of the club rests
in the hands of its regulars.

With dim lighting and spinning
strobes ‘swirling swishes of color
around the room, the music of the
times generates an energy which is not
like any other in Oakland, with the
possible exception of Delaney’s Pub.

. With Harry Wagner providing the aural

massage, Pittsburgh's nightclubbers
dance to the beat of their own drums.

For the most part, most of the peo-
ple imaginatively sway their append-
ages gracefully across the twinkling

   
 

With remnants from hardcore punk,
’60s drug trips and lots of ’50s Fie-
juvinists, the atmosphere of the

"Upstage could be labelled as eclectic,

or more appropriately, eccentric, or
perhaps just plain trendy.

Dressing for success at the Upstage
is hardly a trivial event, considering the
emphasis placed on trying to be Malloy
Dress for Success himself. What
seems to be most controversial
though, is being able to spot significant
trends in fashion, and_incorporating
them in “Upstage-Wear.” For exam-
ple, one does not wear jeans unless
they are either Girbaud, Tommy Heif-
inger or too old to be worn while

bathing your dog. Jewelry is an asset, '

although men should avoid piercing
nipples, cheeks or both ears. One ear-
ring with a distinctive lncan or Aztec
design is complementary. More is too
outrageous.

As fashion is your best social securi-
ty, here is a listing of the current in and
out, ins and outs, for'those creative
enough to dare to be chic:

1986 Showcase Arts and Leisure Predictions

just a gigolo. 
0 The Wham-O Corporation will rein-

By John Young and Michael Fay.

Journalists, like people, have always
enjoyed making predictions. Be it The
New York Times or High Times, predict-
ing international affairs or celebrity af-
fairs, it’s a time-honored tradition. And
here at Showcase we feel that it’s
about time we honored it. So here they
are, direct from Showcase’s own Arts
and Leisure Laboratories in Eugene,’
Ore. are the results of our “1986
popular predictions.”

0 Burt Reynolds will release the se-
quel to a film which was never made.
Before he is able to explain the mix-
up, it becomes a box-office smash.

0 ZZ Top will score 10 hit singles
from “Afterburner.” Each track will
have an accompanying video, and for
the song “Can’t Stop»Rockin’,” Don
Johnson will be tossed the keys while

I

the Police reunite to appear in drag as V

the three ladies in the Ford.

0 David Letterman will sart saying
things so stupid that his “Late Night”
show will be moved to prime time.

0 Duran Duran will officially split.
Nick Rhodes will have a sex change
operation, Simon Le Bon will began an

  
     

  

intense study of Herman Melville’s
works, and John and Andy Taylor will
appear in the reformed Chic. Roger
Taylor will remain obscure.

0 While doing an interview with
Playgirl magazine and discussing

various aspects of his physique,
Sylvester Sta||one’s ego will expand
until it actually splits, forming two more
multi-million-dollar American
fascinations.

0 Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame
will produce every album recorded in
1986. '

o Husker Du will get their first No. 1
single when they make a big-label
debut on Sire records in the summer.
A tour will follow with the Huskers
opening for Madonna. The self-
proclaimed “Boy Toy” will incorporate
a giggly rendition of “Makes No Sense
At‘All” into her act out of deference to
Bob Mould.

0 The ever-fashionable David Bowie

will fall out of grace for several weeks

until his fans and‘ admirers can ra-
tionalize his cameo role in the sequel
to a Burt Reynolds movie that was

never made.

0 AOR radio will play the new
Ramones album heavily and make it
a top-seller. A negligent Grammy
Awards committee will be red-faced
after presenting the band the award as
“Best New Group,” swearing they had
never heard of the band until now.

0 Phylis Diller and Rip Taylor will
take the nation's talk shows by storm
following a highly succesful Brillo Soap
Pad commercial and a resulting multi-

‘picture deal with 20th Century Fox. it

will all happen so fast you probably
won't notice; ' ’

0 “Diamond” David Lee Roth will
announce his decision to become
celibate in the wake of so many
sexually-transmitted diseases. Dave
will clearly state that the move will not
prohibit his ogling women and assure
that his videos will remain ‘‘loaded with
voluptuous women I can degrade as
they prance around half-naked.” He’s

troduce the Hula Hoop. It will flop and
be hastily removed from the market
when young heavy-metal enthusiasts
start using them in occult ceremonies.

0 Trevor Horn will be enlisted to pro-
duce U2’s next album but will quickly
be fired after suggesting the band
release three dance mixes of “40.”
Dave Stewart will step in to save the
project.

0 Henry Rollins will forsake his sing-
ing duties with Black Flag to replace
Bryant Gumbel as co-anchor of NBC’s
“Today Show.” Rollins will accidently
disintegrate Jane Pauley on his debut
show with the sheer intensity of his
presence.

A ‘f

Nutcracker brings tradition, magic and holiday cheer

By David Zuchowski

The staging of The Nutcracker,
along with Dicken’s A Christmas Carol,
has become a sine qua non of every
major city’s holiday arts repertoire.
Pittsburgh is no exception to this rule
as the Ballet Theatre, one of America’s

premiere dance companies, will per-

 
   

&

form the ballet which opens Dec. 20 at
Heinz Hall for a fifteen-performance
run. .

The Nutcracker first opened at the
Maryinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg in
December of 1892. The ballet is based
on a story by E.T.A. Hoffman entitled
The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.
The story had incredible appeal in im-
perial Russia, even more so than in

Hoffman’s native Germany. Martius
Petipa, the Imperial Theatre’s ballet

W1.-.c5Q1-H,‘

master, used Alexander Dumas’ adap-‘V

tation of the story in his libretto.
The story line begins with a
Christmas party at the house of the
Stah|baum’s.' The young girl, Mary,
receives the gift of a nutcracker from
her mysterious uncle, Herr Pross-
meyer. When the guests-depart, Mary
returns to the living room"and falls
asleep on the couch with her nut-
cracker. She dreams that the nut-
cracker leads the toy soldiers into bat-
tle against a mouse king and his army
of mice. Mary saves the nutcracker by
throwing her shoe at the mouse king
and destroying him. The nutcracker is
then magically transformed into a

Tchaikovsky reluctantly accepted"

the commission to write the score
under the strict and confining re-
quirements established by Petipa.
Many critics feel the overture to the
ballet has a Mozartian spirit but the en-
tire composition is a veritable interna-
tional ethnographic exhibit. The
opening party scene, for instance, has

A the guests dance an old German

Grossevatetang. in Act II the score in-
cludes a Russian trepak, a French
polka and contradance and an Arabian
dance which is really a Georgian
lullaby. While composing the score
Tchaikovsky was dissatisfied with his
work and the ballet’s -premiere was
considered a failure. Petipa, the

original choreographer fell ill and his

duties were assumed by his assistant
Leo lvanov. The sets were deemed too
cumbersome. The aristocratic Russian
audience considered the plot too “Ger-
man middle class,” the ballerina, An-

toinetta Dell’Era, ugly, the score banal _

and the sight of children on stage ir-
ritating. Tchaikovsky was crushed, and
the ballet, although it continued to be
performed, fell into almost immediate
disrepute. A year later Tchaikovsky

died believing his final ballet to be a
failure.

For 60 intermittent years The Nut-
cracker was restaged but with only

modest success. The ballet saw its
West European debut at Sadler’s
Wells Theatre in London on Jan. 30,
1934 with Alicia Markova and Harold
Turner. In the same production Margot
Fonteyn (then known as Peggy
Hookham) made her stage debut as a
snowflake. Three years later she would
dance the sta_rring role. The first com-
plete U.'S. production was performed
by the San Francisco Ballet on Dec.
29, 1944. But the real impetus for The
Nutcracker didn’t begin until Bal|an-
chine’s version with the New York City
Ballet production in 1954. Since then
the ballet has grown in popularity to
where it is now viewed by millions of
people throughout the world each
year.

The staging of the ballet poses some
unique problems. Craig Margolis,
PBT’s stage manager, describes the
time from the end of the party to the
Snowflake Dance as “an intense stage
transition period,” full of harried and
hectic behind-the-scenes maneuver-
ing. The Christmas tree, for instance,
has to grow “magically” from a 16-foot
sapling to a 30-foot colossus. Craig’s

solution is to telescope the tree with in-

terfitting rods that allow the tree to_

grow to its gigantic size. The script also
calls for the wings on the grandfather

‘clock to flap while the clock chimes on

the hour. He solved this problem by
having a stage hand lie on his stomach
behind the clock manually moving the
wings. Also, the snow called for in the
Snowflake Dance is really fireproof
paper shreds that fall from two huge
40 feet by 3 feet stretcher bags
mounted on rolling pipes.

The Nutcracker is magic. it can
transform a drab, gray day, through a
subtle emotional alchemy, into a
golden, lustrous, luminescent ex-
perience that recalls the fantasies and
joy of our childhood Christmases. The
music and dance combine to
epitomize the deep joy "pervading the
holiday season. To quote Mavelock

TOWN AND COUNTRY
The Rave-Ups
Fun Stuff Records Inc.

Positively influenced by Bob Dylan,
the Rave-Ups offer a gutsy blend of

-rock ‘n’ roll, folk and country, accom-

panied by intelligent, sometimes
challenging, lyrics. Town And Country
comes chock full of well-crafted songs,
flashy instrumental work and a diver-
sity of sounds that, rather than confus-
ing, keeps the record continually ex-
citing “Miss Molly” Ringwald, a" fan of
the band, must be proud.
“Positively Lost Me,” with its
country-tinged yelping vocals and ef-
fective blend of electric and acoustic
guitars, chugs along to Tomithy J.’s
sharp drumming — and it vigorously
opens the album. Along the way, the
Ramones-flavored, beach music
rocker ‘‘In My Gremlin,” the bright
sharp cover-of Dylan’s “You Ain’t
Goin’ Nowhere” and the growling
rockabilly pose of “Rave UplShut Up”
sparkle with their enthusiastic
renderings. ‘

pulsive, real-sounding rhythm section.

Producer Stephen Barnlard makes
good use of the group’s musical
talents, his arrangements spotlighting
each player's work in time. Barnlard
often employs an open, crisp sound to
songs, but other sounds, like the swirl-
ing, spacey quality he creates on
“Radio,” work too. The subtle textur-
ing used, such as the soft, humming
harmonica on “By The Way” and
Sneaky Pete Kleinow’s pedal steel
guitar appearances, add to The Rave-
Ups’ performances.

The Rave-Ups liberally draw on the

sounds of Dylan, Creedence Clear- A.

water Revival and even The Eagles in
arriving at a blend of diverse influences
that comprise their sound. There's no
sense in calling them the next REM,
nor titling their music “Cowpunk” or
“New American” or whatever label is
fashionable this week. The best idea
is to listen to Town and Country and
revel in the sounds of a band that pays
homage to rock greats while forging a
unique, uncompromising musical iden-

tity. On Town And Country, The Rave-. V

VIVE LE ROCK
Adam Ant

V CBS Records

Adam Ant has pulled on a pair of
Levi’s. Abandoning his 1983 striptease
(a hot and cold album titled Strip) and
his past of being England's eccentric
fashion plate/rock star/sex symbol for
which he dressed in pirate garb with
flamboyant chaps and prismatic make-
up, we find Adam Ant dressed in jeans
and a leather jacket (with virtually no
‘make-up) for his new video “Vive Le
Rock.”

That’s ironic, really, since most of

' the material on the new album takes
-_ Ant back to the release of Friend or

Foe, his first album after his departure

_ from Adam and the Ants. He’s re-

turned to the cynical style, following

' the pop-oriented Strip, which comes

complete with the pulsating jungle-
trappings, the rapid-fire phrasing and
the African war chants that made him
famous (right along with early efforts

from bands like Bow Wow Wow) in the
first place.

The title cut is a crazy rock anthem
that’s just about the funnest dance
song from Ant since “Goody Two

Shoes.” On one hand, it’s radio.

masterwork, an English mirror image
of “Born In The U.S.A.,” and on the
other hand, it’s a stinging commentary

  

on the effects of nuclear war. In the
song, Ant jumps from I try to tell you
but you just don ’t understand/ You got
my entire life in your hands to simply
Be smart/ play dead/ Live to fight a new
day.

Yet Vive Le Rock is not devoid of

. Adam Ant’s offbeat nature. He pulls on

an astronaut’s uniform for “Apollo 9,”

_ a high-strung dance out that’s fast and _
furious, and raps it in a delirious new-

wave twang. And on “P.O.E.” his at-
tack is on none other than Khruschev
himself: Damn your eyes Mr.
Khruschev/ Don ‘t go dropping bombs
on here/ Cause if you start dropping
bombs over here/ We ’re gonna have to
drop some bombs over there. Power-
ful stuff, indeed, but Ant breezes
through this song so nonchalantly that
it’s almost funny.

On all the songs mentioned, as well
as on other lively cuts like “Razor
Keen” and “Mohair Lockeroom Pin-
Ups Boys,” we welcome back percus-
sionist Count Wiczling (his first work
with Antsince t_he Friend or Foe album)

 

and new band member Chris DeNiro
who plays bass with frenetic fervor. At
times, there’s a real camaraderie
going on here.

Though most of Vive Le Rock works, '

the album does have its unfortunate
moments. “Scorpio Rising” sounds
too much like “Montreal” (from his last
album) and “No Zap” is a song that
ridiculously explains itself. On both
counts, Ant leaves behind a lot of the
marimba-powered, Caribbean-flavored
influences which makes so much of his
music invigorating.

Overall, this one’s fun. It’s nice to
see Adam 'Ant doing what he does
best: belting out sharp-edged, choppy
vocals with sarcasm along with a
sense of humor and playing with a
dance beat straight from the jungle.
He’s a rock-n-roll cheerleader and
much of Vive /e Rock is just as exciting
as riding the Thunderbolt on nitrous
oxide.

_Showcase, December 6, 1985

 

By G.B. Patterson

Today is the last day of class. Thank
God. Now all we have to worry about
is — gulp — finals. Most people
become all too worked up about finals.
What’s the big deal? At what other
juncture in life can you walk around in
sweats (for days on end), drink in-
numerable cups of coffee and stay up
24 hours a day without question?

_ lt’s called The Finals Syndrome. .
‘ " TFS takes place two times a year here

at Pitt (unless you are one of those in-
dustrious people who goes to school
while I’m at the beach “working”). It
seems that as much as people com-
plain about finals, they look forward to
them, too.

TFS begins with the ever-popular
“Reading Period.” l’ve been here
three years and I still don’t know what
the hell a “Reading Period” is. Then
the actual testing period starts. What’s
the biggie? You go in and take the
thing. You get your grade on
Christmas Eve, then promise to do bet-
ter next semester. is that all, or is there
more to it than I let on? Well, after in-

tense research and personal ex-
perience with TFS, l’ve come up with
some conclusions about finals. _

— They’re no harder than any other
test. lt’s just that they’re called
“Finals.”

— The word “cumulative” is only
a scare tactic. The teachers don’t even
remember stuff from October.

—— More peoplego to local taverns
during TFS than at any other time of
yean

— Nobody prepares for a final exam
until the night before the ‘test.

You may not agree with all of my
conclusions, but I’m sure you found
validity in at least one or two of them.
Before I go on, let me ask you one
thing. How many of you planned to get
all ready for finals and catch up in all
of your classes over Turkey Day
break? Now, an even better question:
How many of you did? I thought so.

It may be easier for you to better
understand the importance of TFS if I
relate to you the experience of one Pitt
undergrad. |’l| call him Andy. He has
four finals spread over a 10-day period.
It is day one.

Finally!

Andy doesn't have an exam for
three days, so he sleeps in until 1 p.m.
He flips on “All My Children” and has
a pop-tart. After Tad and Dotti have yet
another lover’s quarrel, Andy moves to
more educational viewing. He catches
reruns of “The Beverly Hillbillies,”
“Gomer Pyle” and ‘‘McHale’s Navy.”
He then goes to the Towers for dinner
and makes plans with friends to go out
that night.

So go the next two days. Andy
wakes the day before the exam and

« realizes that TFS has really set in. He

calls some friends who have the same
class and asks them what and how
they’ve studied for the exam so far.
Since none of them have begun to
study, they all decide to get together
for a mass study session. The first
order on the agenda — pizza. After
consuming the Capri delight, the
diligent students decide that 3/4 of the
material they had planned to study
wouldn’t be on the exam. After this
monumental decision, the guys decide
to take the first of many study breaks,
(you really shouldn’t jump right into in-
tense studying) so they go down to

   

7-11 for some coffee.

. When they return, they really get into
the meat of their studying for about 20
minutes. Then the second study break,
then the third. lt’s a vicious cycle.

. Well, after an entire night of this on-
again, off-again studying, the guys go

in and take their test. They feel really .

good after it's over — not because they

feel that they did particulary well, just

Some of the dimmer people
who read this column (not you,
/’m sure) seemed to have missed
the point of the last edition. By
reviewing a bunch of singles
from 1965 as if I had just heard
them and making preposterous
judgments like “This will never
last” about classics like the
Beatles’ “Yesterday,” I was at-
tempting to point out the absur-
dity of writing this column and
the equal absurdity of anyone
taking my opinion for the gospel
truth. I am, after all, just a jerk like
you. What I think I ’ll start doing
is to put all sarcastic comments
in bold print, so that you can
readily identify them, and we
don ’t get any more threatening
phone calls up here at the paper.
Not that they aren’t fun to get.

The Crunch Bunch: Where’s the
Cap’n?

O.K. Quit giggling. It turns out that
“The Crunch Bunch” is Rick Derrin-
ger’s latest attempt to sneak in the
rock ‘n’ roll back door and guess what?
lt’s terrible. The premise is amusing,
but the song is repetitive, annoying
and surprisingly humorless. The
vocalist calls out lines like Is he hangin’
out on MTV?/ Has he sailed to another
galaxy?, then shouts Crunch bunch],
and some whiny back-up singers
screech something or other, and so on.

saxophone solo in the middle, but it
falls short of saving the song. Why
would Derringerwant to make a one-
shot novelty record at this point in his
career? Does anyone care?

What Derringer really needs is less
puffed rice and more crunch-berries.

D

Aretha Franklin: Who ’s Zoomin’ Who?
For those of you scoring at home, this
will be the third time this year that I
have publicly denounced Aretha
Franklin. '
_ At this point, there is very little I can
say. You, certainly, have made up your
mind —— either you are happy about
Aretha’s comeback or, like me, you are
disgusted by the waste of her once-
thriving talent on this soulless, bubble-
gum Top 40 garbage. If nothing else,
Who’s Zoomin’ Who? gets my vote for
the Stupidest Song Title of the Cen-
tury, and the content is equally vapid.
If you haven’t noticed, “soul” is no
longer the exclusive domain of a hand-
ful of Motown icons — it has spread to
all forms of popular music by means
of mass cultural awarenesss, so that
a pale Scottish boy [see Waterboys
review — Ed. ] is as capable of record-
ing something with “sou|” — grit,
depth, emotion —. as a beleaguered
ghetto blues guitarist. Conversely, a
“soul” star is just as capable of recor-
ding utter crap as anyone else. Don’t
misunderstand me — this song isn’t ut-
ter crap. But compared with some of
Aretha’s older stuff, it is less than

nothing._

So I’ll just have to talk American.

Why studio whiz Trevor Horn
(Frankie Goes to Hollywood, The Art
of Noise) would want to hook up with
a French ballad singer is beyond me,
but it’s a happy union. Instead of ZTT
Records’ usual cacophony of com-
puterized babble, this music features
a full orchestra and lush, romantic pro-
duction, pleine de melodrama and
Pigalle’s emotional abandon. The
lyrics are part French and part English
(in case this should break away as an
American hit, which it won’t), but the
only line discernible through the ac-
cent is thetitle. This is good music to
listen to while sitting at home sipping
a cafe au lait. Or you can listen to it on
headphones at the bibliotheque. OK,
I’ll stop.

This song is about a guy who wakes

So just what is all this hullabaloo
about rating records? According to
Recording Industry Association of
America President Stanley Gortikov,
rating some 25,000 records each year
is next to impossible. According to pop

In any event, Gore, Baker and the
PMRC seem to be all but dictating the
public’s perceptions of certain songs
and overlooking areas of music which
prove their very own hypocrisy. Are
they ignoring the performers who
aren't as notorious as they might

daughter. And Susan Baker has ac-
cused Madonna of teaching young
girls “how to act like a porn queen in
heat.” So what if the gal likes to roll
over suggestively on city sidewalks?
This is a different generation, a
generation where eroticism is

switching gender, a day and age,

where “Girls Just Want To Have Fun”
(Cyndi Lauper herself being chided for
the autoeroticism of “She Bop”). Just
try to pry the Like A Virgin album from
a 14-year-old Madonna fan. Just try.

What the PMRC wants is a ratings
system: X for profanity, violence and
sexually explicit lyrics, D/A for lyrics
that “glorify” drug and alcohol abuse,
and O for lyrics dealing with the occult.
But they want more: albums deemed
vulgar behind the counter, bound in
brown wrappings. And they want lyrics
printed somewhere on the albums in
“easy-to-read” type. Exactly what
good this does once a record is sealed,
wrapped in brown paper or behind the
counter, is left to the imagination.

Record industry executives view the
ratings as a prelude to censorship

since stores might refuse to carry
albums which have earned a black
mark rating.

The fight is not a one—team.battle,
either. In fact, it’s the PTA who began
the crusade in June of 1984 at their na-
tional convention. Back then, industry
response was slight. Bob Merlis, public
relations director for Warner Bros.
Records, put it simply: “The function
of rock and roll is to annoy, parents.
This just proves that nothing
changes.” But since the PMRC has in
its grasp advocates like the PTA and
musicians like Smokey Robinson (who
said “something has to be done about
sexually explicit |yrics”), the PMRC
has more power to them. Only recent-
ly have artists banded together to form
an anti-ratings groups called the
Musical Majority (which includes artists
like Don Henley, Cyndi Lauper, the
Pointer Sisters, John Cougar Mellen-
camp and Lionel Richie).

Perhaps Tipper Gore and Susan
Baker ought to take a second look at
their own record collections. Because
for every Prince who sings Girl it ain’t
no use/ You might as well get loose/
Work your body/ Like a whore, there’s
a Joan Jett (When you come crawling
back/ I ’m gonna spit in your face/ And

because it’s over. They know that
everyone else utilized the same study
tactics as they did, so they’re not wor-
ried. They go to Peter’s to toast the
ever-popular curve. It doesn’t even
matter if they get drunk. There’s not
another exam for two days.

So goes the most common study
ritual at Pitt. Sure, there are people
who really do study during “normal”
hours, but they are certainly the minori-
ty. Besides, when one undertakes the
study methods of our friend, Andy, he
looks ragged when he gets home —
the key to a profitable Christmas
break.

Good luck, and don't sleep through
any finals!

latch your ass) and a Tina Turner (It on-
ly took about a half a minute/ On the
stain/vay/ It was child’s play). For all the
vulgarities on a Ratt album or the
danger dances in a Madonna video,
examine the sexual perverseness and
violence in classic operas like Richard
Strauss’ “Der Rosenkavalier,”
Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” or Montever-
di’s “L’lncoronazione di Poppea.”
Perhaps the PMRC should listen to
some of the country music today with
titles as brave as ‘‘If I Said You Had
A Beautiful Body (Would You Hold it
Against Me)” and watch adult contem-
porary videos like Melissa Man-
chester’s “Thief of Hearts” and its

heavy metal groups for an obvious
reason: they are the most vulnerable,
they are the easy shots. Take away the
freedom of expression in music today
and you take away the imagination, the
ability for every individual to interpret
the music in their own way. The PMRC
has been called a “witch-hunt,” spear-
headed by prominent women who, ac-
cording to Glenn Frey, “have their own
skeletons in their own closets.” With
considerable political clout, the PMRC
has the ability to turn the tables. What
needs to be formed is a movement of
young politicians and musicians who’d
be the most directly affected by cen-
sorship. The black sarcasm here is not

Pushed to its farthest limits, modern
popular music can almost, but not
quite, achieve nothing less than
spiritual transcendence. Every so often

you hear a song that catches you off '

angels fly around the room and you
feel yourself rise a finger’s breadth

Then the song ends and you come

something extraordinary.

This, at least, happened to me when
I first heard this latest Waterboys

single. The Whole of the Moon distills »’~

practically the entire history of rock into
a burst of vision, magic and beauty: To
borrow a phrase from Simple Minds,
it’s a song that shoots up and sparkles
in the rain. Mike Scott sings lines .full
of little epiphanies like lsaw a rain-dirty

if Panthers pound Lafayette;
look for revenge at Xavier

H’.
p .

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Sigh. The Pitt basketball team
coasted to another easy victory
Wednesday at Lafayette, their fourth
consecutive win against schools hard-
ly known for dominating the basketball
court. .

Finally, however, the Panthers will
be tested. Saturday night Pitt will in-
vade the Cincinnati Gardens to battle
a talented Xavier team. Keep in mind
that this is the same Xavier team that
shocked the Panthers 61-58 last season
-— in Pittsburgh.

Xavier, 2-0, is coming off a tough
56-53 win at Creighton on Wednesday.

“It will be a real" good matchup,”
Xavier assistant coach Mike Sussli
said. “The teams are pretty evenly

 matched.”-

ﬁx‘.

if

.3“

3*

5.

 

In fact, the teams have striking
similarities:

0 Both are unbeaten thus far this
season, with Pitt having tasted victory
four times, Xavier twice.

0 They arecoming off similar 1984
seasons. Each team’s season ended
with a winning record, despite having
finished at only .500 in conference
play: Pitt was 17-12 overall, 8-8 in the
Big East Conference, while Xavier was
16-13, 7-7_ in the Midwestern City
Conference.

0 Both are led by talented
sophomores. Charles Smith, a 6-10

-forward, has provided scoring,

rebounding and leadership to the young
Panthers. Likewise, shooting guard
Byron’ Larkin has done much the same
for Xavier, averaging nearly 20 points
per game this season after pouring in
17 "per game as a freshman.

Larkin, a former Parade All-
America football player at Moeller
High in Cincinnati, is only one of five
starters returning for Xavier. Still,
Sussli would much rather talk about Pitt
than discuss Xavier’s possible banner
season.

“I don’t want to say anything about
our players,” Sussli said. “Pitt really
concerns us. We’ll have to do a lot of
things well to win.”

Having studied the scouting‘ reports

on Pitt, Sussli was awed by the Pan-
thers in all categories.

“Pitt is a great team with great
athletes,” Sussli said. “Pitt rebounds
great, and that Smith is a pro. There
are just so many things Pitt does well.”

Wednesday night: Demetreus Gore
scored a career high 24 points to lead
Pitt to a 94-65 win at Lafayette
Wednesday night. Pitt upped their
record to 4-0 and play Xavier Satur-
day in Cincinnati.

Gore, a 6-5 guard from Detroit, had
the hot hand from the ﬁeld and the free
line. He hit on 10 of 15 ﬁeld goals,
while sinking all four foul shots.

Charles Smith added 22 points and
11 rebounds for Pitt.
Westminster held Smith, last season’s
Big East Rookie of the Year, to 13
points in the season opener, Smith
came alive. He has scored at least 20
points in three consecutive games, rais-
ing his per-game average to 22.2 in the
process.

Freshman Jerome Lane scored 20
and Curtis Aiken 14 for Pitt.
Lafayette’s Otis Ellis led all scorers
with 25 points.

Swimmers
host meet
at Trees
Saturday

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s swimming and div-
ing team will try to get back its win-

ning ways this Saturday when it hosts '

St. Bonaventure and Marshall at 1:30
p.m. at Trees Pool.

The Panthers are 2-1 this season with
opening victories over Virginia and
Kent State. The Panthers only loss of
the season was on the road when they

. were defeated by Big East opponent

Villanova.

“There has been a general overall
improvement in the team’s perform-
ance since Villanova,” said head coach
Fred Lewis. ‘ ‘We’re putting forth some
more effort. We don’t want to overdo
it though.”

For the Panthers to come out on top,
strong performances will be needed in
certain events. ‘ ‘The medley relay team
will have to do well,” said Lewis.
“Also, we will have to ﬁnish 1-2 on
the boards and get some good points
from the 100- and 200-yard
freestyles. ’ ’ ’

The diving has been solid for the
Panthers, led by senior Todd Mulzet
and junior Jack Shuten. Other strong
performances include Rick James in the
200-yard backstroke and freestyle and
Donald Martin in the 200-yard in-
dividual medley.

Wrestlers
head to
Penn State
University

By Patrick Good 1
Staff Writer

This is a very important weekend for
the Pitt wrestling team as they travel
to State College to compete in the
highly competitive Penn State Invita-
tional. The invitational will include the
stiffest competition Pitt will face before
the Eastern Wrestling League Cham-
pionships at Bloomsburg in late
February.

“This is a very tough tournament
with 20 teams set to compete,” said
head coach Rande Stottlemyer. “Some
of the best teams in the East will be
there and for that matter, some of the
finest teams in the country will par-
ticipate."

Among the top teams competing will
be host Penn State, the,No. 3 team in
the nation, and Clarion University, cur-

rently the No. 13 team in the top 20

rankings according to Wrestling News
Magazine. In all, 20 teams will battle
for the top four slots in each of the 10
weight classes, but there will not be a
team championship.’

“There isn’t a team champion, so
this tournament is solely for the in-
dividuals,” said Stottlemyer. “Of the
top four place finishers, I would like
to see some [familiar] faces among
those four who stand atop the awards
platform.

“What I’m looking for from our
guys is good technique and intensity,”
added Stottlemyer. “This is a chance

already learned, and the competition is
such that they’ll gain valuable ex-
perience and confidence. ’ ’

The team’s best chance for individual
championships will be in senior co-
captains Kyle Nellis and John Hnath.
Last week at the Lock Haven tourna-
ment Nellis and Hnath earned first- and
third-place ﬁnishes, respectively. In ad-
dition to an individual championship,
Nellis was also named MVP for his im-
pressive performance.

For Nellis there may be pressure to
win again, but his coach is hoping
that’s not the case. “Kyle sometimes
puts too much pressure on himself to
win. He’s the youngest of six brothers
from a family with great wrestling
tradition, so there is pressure for him
to win,” Stottlemyer said. “What Kyle
needs to do is go out and cut it loose,
and the wins will take care of
themselves. ’ ’

Nellis himself agrees the competition
is ﬁerce and that he needs to be more
relaxed. “The competition at Penn

State is a real bear, but I’m up for it,” '

Nellis remarked. “I’m off to a good”
start. I have more conﬁdence now go-

ing into this weekend, but I need to stay ‘

relaxed and wrestle my style.”

Pitt’s hopes for an individual title
don’t rest solely on Nellis, however.
Coach Stottlemyer feels he has other
legitimate contenders. “Johnny Hnath
is a really tough competitor, so you
must always consider his chances, and
our freshman Pat Santoro did real well
last week as he, like Hnath, got a third-
place finish,” said the ever-confident
Stottlemyer. “I'm also sure seniors Joe
Bond and Doug Haines will make it
tough on some people up there.”

Santoro, the starter at 142 lbs. , came
to Pitt fresh from winning the National
Prep Championship and the Outstand-
ing Wrestler Award from Blair
Academy near Bethlehem, Pa.

The competition will be difﬁcult, but
no matter how the results turn out the
team will certainly have gained
‘valuable experience that should pay off
in the long run.

sylvania tonight at 7:30.

 

Year-end thoughts: Louis

Well, here we are with another
yuletide season upon us. One of my
favorite sports is Christmas shopping.
The competition is getting pretty in-
tense this year. I’ve seen unbelievable
speediand spectacular moves. These
people should try out for the Steelers’
offense. Either that or they should
make 11 clones of Louis Lipps (one ex-
tra in case of injury). But anyhow, in
case you’re wondering, here's what

-I’ve_ been thinking about lately.

I recently went to see “Rocky IV”
and loved every minute of it. This may
very well have overthrown the original
for being the best in the series. It had

a lot to say about modern day sports_

and modern day athletes. It also dealt
‘with the USA—USSR relations. -But
most of all,_ Rocky was trying to tell

= all young athletes that just because the

rich kid down the block has a lot of fan-
cy training equipment, that doesn’t
mean a thing. You can’t train “heart.”
On the other hand, it’s just my opinion,
but I think that Rocky’s training tech-
niques were the best that I have ever
seen, and anyone can afford the

“equipment” that he used.

While we’re on the subject of box-
ing, I can’t wait for the ﬁght tonight.
In case youfre not a big fight fan,

Milton “The Iceman” McCrory and“

   
 

Donald “The Cobra” Curry will be
unifying the welterweight champion-
ship of the world. It’s not so much
who’s ﬁghting, I’m just glad to see a
title being unified. I don’t expect much
from the ﬁght as far as distance goes.
I look for Curry to drop McCrory in-
side of seven rounds, maybe less. Both
have announced plans to move on to
the junior-middleweight division after
this ﬁght. If given another shot, Colin
Jones will rule the division once they
leave.

One Christmas present that I’m sure
all boxing fans would like is a promise
from Michael Spinks that he will never
grant Gerry Cooney a title shot unless
Cooney can defeat three top contenders

in succession. I honestly feel that both .

“Marvelous” Marvin Hagler and John
“The Beast” Mugabi could take the far
too passive heavyweight. Think I’m
crazy? Jack Dempsey (5-11, 190 lbs.)
knocked out Jess Willard (6-5, 250
lbs.) in three rounds. He scored seven
ﬁrst-round knockdowns. A

If they ever get in the ring, Mugabi

will knock Hagler out inside of six '

rounds. You heard it here ﬁrst.

I’ve recently spent a lot of time be-
ing impressed by the new Pirate
management. And while I’m making
predictions, here’s another. Before next
season, look for the Pirates to trade

The'Pitt News, December 6, 1985

Lipps clones and the new Pirates

Jason Thompson and Larry McWil—
liams for a 'rninor—league thirdbaseman
that you’ve never heardsof before, but
who will nonetheless be starting on
“the hot corner” before season’s end.

How about one more? The Pirates
will ﬁnish in fourth place, just four
games under .500.

I recently wrote a letter to Santa that
went something like this:

Congratulations on signing Rudolph
to that new long-term contract. His
holdout was beginning to worry me.
Lucky for you, it didn’t go to arbitra-
tion. You would’ve probably lost, con-
sidering that you’re going to need him
because of the weather that we’re sup-
posed to have this winter. I’ll bet that
a lot of skiers have suddenly started go-
ing ‘to church again and took to prais-
ing the Lord for all of the snow that
we’re supposed to get.

Speaking of praising the Lord, thank

God that Blitzen’s knee is going to be
ﬁne for the big night. It’s a good thing
that you called. in that specialist for high
ﬂiers, Doctor Jay.
V I’m not asking for much this Christ-
mas, just a time machine. If it’s possi-
ble, I’d like one with automatic
transmission and an AM-FM radio. I’d
like to see a few things like:

0 Satchel Paige’s fastest pitch.

0 Josh Gibson’s _l_1or_n_e run that he hit

“I , ‘I

J

I

out of Yankee Stadium.
0 The Galloping Ghost on a good
day.
0 The Four Horsemen.

°Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point
game.
‘Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell

(every one).

0 Pete Rose in a Little League game.

0 Joe Malone’s seven-goal game.

0 The Montreal Canadiens, way
back when hockey was played
outdoors.

0 Any John L. Sullivan ﬁght.

0 Jackie Robinson stealing home.

0 Ty Cobb vs. Walter Johnson.

0 A week of games at Forbes Field
during the 1960 season.

0 A week of games at Yankee
Stadium during the 1927 season.

0 The Babe “going downtown.”

0 Ed Delahanty doing the same.

0 Bears 73, Redskins 0.

0 ‘Jim Brown grinding it out in a win-
dy snowstorm at Cleveland Municipal
Stadium.

0 Gale Sayers scoring touchdowns
using every conceivable method.

0 Bob Cousy on a night that he feels
like showing off.

0 Max Zaslofsky ﬁring in 25-footers
like they’re free throws.

0 George Mikan dominating “the
paint.”

0 A week of games at Exposition

 

Park (the initial home of the Pirates).

0 Christy Mathewson vs. Honus
Wagner.

0 Any football game involving two
teams who employ the single wing.

0 But more than anything, I would
like to venture to Elysian Field. in
Hoboken, N.J . The date would be June
19, 1846. The event would be the birth
of professional baseball, the ﬁrst game.
I would lean over to one of the other
fans and whisper, “Hey, I think
they've got something here!”

Well, Santa, I know you’ve got a lot
to do, so I’ll sign off now. Say “hi’
to Mrs. Claus for me. Have a safe trip.
Happy holidays.

‘ I’d like to end the year with a few
stray thoughts.

He who doubts, has already lost.

Gerry Faust will probably be the next
Pitt football coach. He’s a helluva nice
guy. He’d be elected Pope in a few
years, but he doesn’t look good in
robes. .

I HATE TURF!!!

Alexander Cartwright invented
baseball, not Abner Doubleday.

Anyone who thinks that Pete Rose
can’t produce anymore is either jealous
or doesn’t know a damn thing about
baseball-. A

Sports are like a thunderstorm in the

The Pitt News, December 6, 1985

Pitt runners aim  
to keep on track
at Virginia meet

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer ‘

Pitt’s men’s track team will be travel-
ing to Fairfax, Va. this weekend to at-
tend the Patriot Invitational at George
Mason University. According to Coach
John Vasvary, the team has done very
well there in the past. Vasvary noted,
“We have had some NCAA qualiﬁers,
some IC4A qualiﬁers and even some
school records come out of there.” For
Vasvary, the main purpose of the meet
will be to test his athletes. ‘ ‘We would
like to see where they are, and this
meet should give us a good indica-
tion,” added Vasvary. =

The Patriot Invitational will afford
Pitt some very stiff competition. Teams
such as Maryland, Georgetown, East
Carolina and The United States Naval
Academy will be in attendance. How-
ever, Pitt is up for the challenge. Pitt
will be sending along people such as
Lee McRae, who last week set a new
school record in the 55-meter dash,
Eric Cannon, who in the same meet
tied a school record in the 50-meter
high hurdles and Alan Laws, who set
a track record in the 500-meter dash.
In addition, there will be a host of IC4A
qualiﬁers, such as George Iﬁll in the

-long jump, Tim Manes in the

800-meters and Joe Daniels in the
1000-meters.

Vasvary says that he is looking for-
ward to his best season ever as coach
of the Pitt Track Team; and indications
are that they will be tough competition
for anybody that comes up against
them. The team had gone into a state
of decline in the late ’70s but is once
again rising to the top. The best track
athletes in the country are beginning to

visit Pitt and really give it a good hard 4

look. Vasvary said, “We once again
have the names such as Lee McRae,
Eric Cannon and Rodney Giles, all of
whom were among the best in their
event in high school.”

Things are really beginning to look
up for the Panthers’ track team.
Vasvary cited, for example, that “last
year we had a 4x10 meter relay team
that broke the school record, and this
year it looks as though Lee McRae will
be the only one from that squad who
will make it back.” Vasvary seemed
to be very confident about his team’s
chances this year, not only at the Patriot
Invitational but at all of the meets they
attend this year.

When Vasvary took over- the team
four years ago, he was faced with a
squad that consisted mostly of seniors
with very few underclassmen. Since
then, he has. had to go through a major
rebuilding of the team, but the results
seem to be in his favor. “This year
people are really starting "to talk about
what they can do; and since I have been.
here, nobody has really done that,” he
said. The track team is avery well
rounded group of individuals and looks
to be strong in just about every event.
“This year, for the first time, we have
that calming inﬂuence provided by the
upperclassmen which we had lacked in
previous years,” added Vasvary.

The Panthers are hoping to do well
at George Mason. The competition
there will show them if they are as good
as they think or if they are just expect-
ing a little too much. “We can use this
meet to see how good we are because
Christmas vacation comes after it, and
that will give us-time to work on any
problems,” Vasvary said. The way

things are looking though, Christmas_

vacation will be spent improving an
already powerful team.

The Pitt track team will rely heavily upon its
sprinters this weekend at the Patriot Invitational.
