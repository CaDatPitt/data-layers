Diverting a bomb threat trial

More than a year after scares on campus, a former student seeks a new way out of her charges.

Liz Navratil
News Editor

The United State Attorney’s Office
is considering dropping charges
against a former Pitt student in-
dicted for making bomb threats
to campus in April 2008.
Louisa Nkrumah, who is ac-
cused of calling in threats to the
Cathedral of Learning and Posvar

.. Hall, asked the U.S. Attorney’s

Office to consider her for the Pre-
Trial Diversion program.

“Participants who success-

fully complete theprogram will
not be charged or, if charged, will t

have the charges against them
dismissed,” according to the U.S.
Attorneys’ Manual,. which advises
federal prosecutors.

People participating in Pre-

Trial Diversion program work
with the U.S. Probation Service to
create a program aimed at fulﬁll-
ing their needs for employment,
counseling, education, job train-
ing or psychiatric care, among
other things, according to the

manual. ,
Nkrumah is attending Penn
State Harrisburg this fall. Her
attorney, Cynthia Reed Eddy,
believes a temporary delay in

Pitt gets money to
clean up toxic waste

Caitlin Kasunich
Staff Writer

Pitt researchers have received
a federal grant for managing the
toxic waste that might be caused
by accessing a gas reserve — a
project that could be worth tril-
lions of dollars. A _

Located under parts of Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and
New York, the Marcellus Shale
formation contains such a large
amount of natural gas that, if ex-
tracted and sold, it could poten-
tially be worth trillions of dollars,
said Radisav Vidic, professor and
chair of Pitt’s department of civil
and environmental engineering.

Tapping this gas reserve could
lead to serious environmental and
health hazards for people in near-

by communities, Vidic said. But .

he and other Pitt researchers are
working on a $1.06 million federal

project funded by the U.S. Depart- .

ment of Energy to better manage
the wastewater that comes with
extracting gas in the Marcellus
Shale.

Vidic, who has done research
at Pitt since 1992, said the project
gives the University a chance to
make an impact. _ L

“It’s very challenging, but it
gives us the opportunity to do
something really meaningful for
the state and industry,” Vidic said.
“Hopefully, we_ will see it applied in

The Republic of Georgia on her mind

Natalia Arutynov was born in the former Soviet state. Now she has the chance to go home — this time, on scholarship.

Halyse Domencic
Staﬁ Writer

Natalia Arutynov felt like she
was trying to apply for college all
over again. '

She said she spent four months
with "Pitt Director of National
Scholarships Judy Zang, writing
essays and participating in panel
interviews, hoping to get a schol-
arship from the National Educa-
tion Security Program, for which
she would delay her graduation.

Arutynov, a ﬁfth—year senior ’

studying economics, political
science and Russian and Euro-
pean studies, checked her mail-
box about “a hundred times” last
spring. she said.

On May 1, she received a letter
from the program: She’d won its
David L. Boren Scholarship and
will now spend a year in Georgia
to study the language.

“I actually let out a scream and
was just completely overjoyed,”
Arutynov said. “I felt like all those

check it out.

years of work and the past few
months of a rigorous application
process all have ﬁnally paid off.”

Arutynov’s scholarship gives

her up to $20,000 to study in an

area critical to the United States’
national security.

Born in the Republic of Geor-
gia, Arutynov will return to her
country Thursday.

“Now that I get to return for
nine months, I can’t wait because
I know that I’ll be able to see more
of the country and experience and
learn more of their amazing cul-
ture,” she said.

Arutynov was ﬁve years old
when she immigratedto the Unit-

ed States in 1991. Since then, she ‘

visited Georgia but does not re-
member much of it from her birth.
Much of what she knows about the
country now comes from family
and personal research.

She said one of her. biggest
obstacles will be the language
barrier, which she hopes she can
break after her classes.

“Adjusting to a new lifestyle
will also be a challenge,.because
visiting a country is one thing, but
living in a country is in a whole
different league,” she said. “You
not only have to adjust to a new
way of living, but to a new cul-
ture, a new set of rules and a very

different outlook on what’s ac- »

ceptable.”

Arutynov, the seventh consec-
utive Pitt student to receive the
scholarship, said she plans to im-
prove her knowledge of Georgia’s
language, history and culture.

“WhatI like about learning for-
eign languages is that one is con-
necting different nations and its
people,” she said. “The same goes
with diplomacy. It’s something
that is associated with peaceful
communication and understand-
ing between nations. It’s a way to
contribute to peace, humanity,
understanding and a bettering
of relations between nations, no
matter how small.”

Arutynov said. she wants to
see as much as the world as she

can and has visited more than 18
countries.

“I love sightseeing and expe— ’

riencing new cultures. It’s like
stepping into a whole new world,”
she said. “Traveling is just that.
It’s about experiencing, learning
and immersing yourself in a new
country and culture.”
Arutynov, who eventually
hopes to attend graduate school
for diplomacy, will work in the

Department of Defense as part of .

the National Security Education

_ Program requirement.

She hopes to study in the
Washington D.C. area and even-
tually work at the U.S. Embassy
in Eastern Europe.

 

Adjusting to a new lifestyle will also be ‘a challenge, because visiting a country is

one thing, but living in a country is in a whole different league.

the economic development.”
Heading the three—year project
with Eric Beckman, co-director of
Pitt’s Mascaro Center for Sustain-
able Innovation and the George M.

Bevier professor of chemical and "

petroleum engineering, Vidic said
that the researchers will focus on
how to reuse this wastewater while
reducing the level of treatment it
requires before being reused.
The natural gas that is available
in the Marcellus Shale is absosbed
in a tightly-packed layer of soil
that must be fractured in order
to allow the gas to escape, said

Vidic. To fracture the rock, work— .

ers must drill a 6,000-foot well
before injecting a high-pressure
mix of local-source freshwater,
sand and chemicals called “slick-
ing agents.”

The sand from the mixture gets
shoved into the shale to keep it
open while the gas travels out of
it, he said. But after injecting 2 to
5 million gallons of the water-sand
mixture, the water needs to get
out of the shale to allow the gas
to escape into the well.

Between 30 to 80 percent of

the water comes back and contains '

so much waste that it can have ﬁve
to six times more salt than sea-
water, he said. This wastewater

contains hydrocarbons, heavy,

metals, natural radioactive ma-
terials and very high levels of total
dissolved solids, which could end
up in surface water and put local
residents at risk. '

To solve this problem, Vidic
said that Pitt researchers "plan to
develop a way to-reuse this waste-
water for fracturing the adjacent
walls.

To do this, they need to develop
new slicking agents that will work
with the highly salty water and to
design chemicals that will allow
them to reuse the-water, no mat-
ter how contaminated it might be.
Vidic said his team also hopes to
ﬁnd a way to use acid mine drain-
age as a sanitizer and supplemen-
tal water source.

The ﬁrst phase of the project
will allow researchers to under-
stand the chemistry of the waste-
water, as well as how it reacts with

acid mine drainage. After com-

pleting studies and inventories on

the water in the Marcellus_Shale,
researchers will design and make
new slicking agents in the labo-
ratory.

They will then test the agent un-
der lab conditions before design-
ing a treatment process, ﬁnding a
suitable site to run a test treatment
and eventually, learning what it
will cost to conduct a large—scale
treatment process.

“It’s a lot of pressure because
everyone’s looking at us and won-
dering how we’re.-goingto do it,”
Vidic said. “It’s also a very real
economical opportunity, so a lot
of companies are trying to get in
on the game.”

Although Vidic said that he has
conducted research for about 20
years, he admitted that this project
has been one of the most exciting
ones that he has worked on over
the course of his career.

“We’re under a little bit of scru-
tiny and pressure,.but it’s what
we’re made to do as researchers,”-
he said. “We solve problems.”

Keep estate

funds, boost

Pitt reputation

efore killing himself,
B George Sodini opened ﬁre

on an LA Fitness aerobics

group, brutally murdering three, -

wounding nine and mentally scar-
ring countless others. In his will,
though, Sodini donated his entire
estate to his alma mater, Pitt —
and valued at $225,000, it is no
triﬂing sum. I

So what do you do when a killer
hands you almost a quarter-mil-
lion dollars? If you’re Pitt, you say,
“No, thanks.”

Pitt has rejected the donation —

—‘— a better response than “It’s a
recession, and we’ll take what we

2 can get.” While it would be repre-

hensible to take the money and
run, Pitt’s acceptance of the funds
could ensure the money makes its
way to the proper recipients: the
wounded survivors and families
of the slain.

The University should accept '

Sodini’s estate and immediately
redistribute its value to his vic-
tims._ ‘

Such an action would save sur-
vivors the complications of court
battles, and it would still allow
Pitt toavoid disreputably keeping
the donation.

In an oﬂicial statement, Pitt
-Vice Chancellor of Public Af-

fairs Robert Hill said, “Pitt has '

no interest in receiving any such
distribution.” Hill also said that
Pitt believes “any available funds
should beneﬁt Mr. Sodini’s victims

‘A and their families.”

_ Hill rightly identiﬁes those
who deserve the money, but by re-
-jecting the donation, Pitt is miss-
ing an opportunity to deﬁnitively
deliver it to them.
In his statement, Hill also said,
“We at Pitt will do what we can
to assist [the victims and their
families] in receiving any funds’
that have been bequeathed to
Pitt.” That might mean Pitt in-
tends to receive and transfer the
donation to Sodini’s victims, but

the statement is too ambiguous.
The University should explicitly
pledge to do so.

Currently, the estate‘ is be-
ing held until the outcome of a
civil lawsuit brought by surviv-
ing victims. Hopefully the courts
give them their due, even though

it cannot compensate for their‘

losses. But if Pitt can assist them
in receipt of the funds, bypass-
ing lengthy litigious disputes, it
should assume that role.
Survivors are faced with
physical therapy, psychological
trauma and even hospital bills.

‘Imagine receiving a bill for be-

ing shot. Worse, imagine getting
a bill for burying your daughter,
wife or mother, and then watching
$225,000 in the killer’s property
go elsewhere. Pitt has it in its pow-
er to stop that from happening.

7 ' Refusing the funds represents
sincerely good intentions, but

that alone would seem like a lazy ‘

way out of a potential public rela-
tions ﬁasco. After all, accepting
the donation and using it to reno-
vate Towers or upgrade a sports
program would be rather crass.

Pitt has a responsibility to
maintain a digniﬁed image, and
keeping Sodini’s estate would sully
that image. More importantly, as
a public institution, the University
has the responsibility to better its
community. '

If the University can deliver
those ﬁmds to the victims, though,
rejecting the money outright
would seem like the University is
shirking these responsibilities.

The victims were not Pitt stu-
dents, but that should not prevent
the University from helping them
if it has the power to do so.

If Pitt can expedite the process
of getting the victims some com-
pensation, the University should
not sit back and hope for the best.
By accepting and redistributing
the funds, the University can ful-
ﬁll its own stated wishes.

until March 2010, according to -

the Port Authority website.
The proposed changes appear

‘ to keep college students in mind

— particularly the Oakland area
—— and the general changes work

_to provide us faster and more re-

liable bus-
ing.

On Fifth
Avenue, for

perverse t0 me.

The idea of changing the Port Authority
on such an extreme level seemed '

‘ ‘example,
the routes
that link
Oakland to
Downtown
—— the 71A,

when-you-get-off,
inbound-outbound thing.

Despite this, when I heard the
Port Authority was planning a
major overhaul of the current
system, I was unnerved.

I cherish the Port Authority.
As a license-less city—&lweller
(yes, it is humiliating), I don’t
really have a choice. And like
Wilbur befriending Templeton,
so did I learn to love the Port Au-
thority not by ignoring its faults,
but because of them.

I love the way there is a 71A,
71C and 71D but no 71B. I love

some kind of maﬁa as he made
threatening calls to some un-
known cohort.

So the idea of changing the
Port Authority on such an ex-
treme level seemed perverse to
me, like when old, rich men di-
vorce their wives to upgrade to a
younger, shinier model.

And yet.— and can’t believe
I’m saying this — when I read
the official “Transit Development
Plan,” I was pleasantly surprised
and even excited about some of
the upcoming changes, which

71C, 71D and 500 — will be re-
conﬁgured into something called
“rapid busing.” According to
the Port Authority website, this
means “faster service with less
frequent stops, off-vehicle fare
payment and stations featuring
special amenities, including real-
time schedule updates.”

If this works, I will take back
every nasty thing I’ve ever said
about the 71A —— e.g. “The 71A is
a worthless piece of sh*t,” “Why
is it every time I want a 500,‘ a
freaking 71A comes around the

bend” and “The 71A looks like a
squashed caterpillar.” -
My biggest complaint about

fifth Avenue,Port Authority ser-
vice is the routes’ complete lack

of regard for the schedule. Real-
time schedule updatesl? That’s
like giving chocolate to a starv-
ing child. s ‘
Rapid Bus is also proposed
for 61-series_ routes, which run
on Forbes Avenue, and the 28X
Airport Flyer, which would no
longer stop through Robinson

Town Centre — bye-bye IKEA. '

My personal favorite change,

‘however, is the extermination of

the 59U route. This is the most
overrated route of all Port Au-
thority buses. It comes about
once every ﬁve years, and it is
never, never on time 7- seriously,
is traffic in Homestead that hop-

ping? ,

And yet, year after year it gets
named The Pitt News Best Of Port
Authority. I know I shouldn’t get
offended on behalf of wonderful,
timely, reliable buses + like say,
the 500 — but I do. '

But for those delusional ones
who somehow love the 59U, the
Port Authority plans to replace

‘this route with three others. This

includes the new 75-Ellsworth,
which will provide service be-
tween East Liberty and the South-
side Works via Shadyside and
Oakland, and the R3 McKeesport
Rapid and R4 Homestead Rapid,
which provide service between
Oakland and Homestead.

There are also a few new
routes. Oneworth noting is the
proposed 93 Lawrenceville-
Oakland, which will, for the
ﬁrst time, provide a direct link’
between Lawrenceville and Oak-
land.

Though this route was no
doubt created in the advent of

the new Children’s Hospital loca-
tion, it allows for the ﬁrst time a
convenient opportunity for stu-
dents to live in-Lawrenceville — a
neighborhood with cheap hous-
ing — without needing a car or
bike. .

Despite this positive review
of the proposal, I have my trepi-
dations, the -first of which is
whether the Port Authority will
even be able to pull it off — will
the “rapid” busing actually be
rapid? If my usual two-hour waits
for the 59U are any indication,’
maybe not.

Moreover, I’m not sure why

the Port Authority felt compelled _

to rename all the routes —— that’s

right, every route. It took me long

enough to learn it the first time
causing many_ accidental trips
into East Liberty, a place one

doesn’t necessarily want to be -

stuck in after 10 p.m.
I guess I will have to reserve fi-

naljudgment until these changes '
, are in place, but in the end I will

follow amotto I often apply to the
Port Authority — I’ll'take what
I can get. _

Charles May, the group’s ﬁddler

years ago from different walks of
musical performance. What start-

genre eventually snowballed into
a now— established presence on the

Pittsburgh Irish music scene.
What? You didn’t know there

Fair enough. After all, this city
seems to have more music venues

Not ‘Joe’ typical Sunday morning brunch

With tasty eats at a budget— friendly price, Joe Mamas new buffet is worth the wake up

Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer

Joe Mamas Italian Deluxe built

a reputation on quality Italian‘

food served on a college stu-
dent’s schedule — late at night,
with parts of the menu going half-
priced after 11 p.m.

Going to the restaurant for
Sunday morning brunch seemed
initially counterintuitive, but it is
completely worth getting up for.

At the corner of South Bouquet
Street and Forbes Avenue, the res-
taurant is hard to miss with its
ﬂashy neon clock advising that it’s
always “Time for Fine Eats.”

The retro style extends to the
indoor decor as well. I personally
am not terribly fond of kitschy,
memorabilia-covered walls and
’80s soundtrack background
music, but they do create an in-

atmosphere.

We arrived promptly at 11
a.m. (the buffet brunch is avail-
able from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.) to ﬁnd
that we had the restaurant nearly
to ourselves, though it ﬁlled up
substantially by the time we left.
The self-serve buffet was stretched
along the restaurant’s back wall
and curved around the corner to
accommodate its many offerings.

The breakfast portion of the
buffet featured classed~up versions
of traditional breakfast fare, from
eggs sprinkled with colorful pep-
pers to apple~smoked bacon and
parmesan—herb crusted potatoes,
putting Market Central’s ﬂoppy
morning options to shame.

Most delightful was the gently-
singed French toast with strawber-
ry-blueberry sauce, maple syrup,
and whipped cream. Piling on all
those toppings would make just
about anything edible, but the
French toast was more than chewy

 

— disputably comfortable family

Tiramisu, antipasto ingredients to bountiful brunch

Brunch 4 7

and delicious enough to hold its
own against the barrage of addi-
tions.

Wary of the delectably ﬂaky
800-calorie croissants, I avoided
the baked goods table. However,
after hearing a fellow diner rave
about the apple turnovers, I feel
secure in the assumption that the
selection of muffins and sctmes
likely were as well. _

I was unable to resist an ador-
ably tiny teacup of tiramisu gen-
tly sprinkled with cinnamon and

chocolate shavings. What initially .

seemed to be a meager pbrtion
turned out to be ideal, once I en-
countered just how extravagantly
rich the creamy classic Italian des-
sert was.

The lunch section consisted
of the Italian food Joe Mamas is
best known for and was predict-
ably good. The chicken and cheese
ravioli was served with a tomato
vodka sauce which my brunch
companion described as “singing
in [her] mouth.” Classic Caesar sal-
ad with giant croutons, antipasto
and skewers of grilled vegetables

and mozzarella cheese were also
available.

The garlic bread constituted
the only real low point of the
meal by being somewhat stale
and lacking the right quantities
of butter and garlic. The offerings
were rounded out with fresh fruit
salad —— somewhat heavy on the
strawberries, but who doesn’t like
a good strawberry? —— and a tanta-
lizing make-your-own parfait bar
including yogurt,-cottage cheese,
granola and several types of nuts
and dried fruits. .

Friendly servers were quick to
offer extra condiments and let us
know as additional dishes came
out of the kitchen.]oe Mamas con-
veniently accepts Panther Funds as
well as cash and credit cards.

Joe Mamas has long been tout-
ed as THE placefto take your par-

ents (or, rather, make them take I

you) in Oakland. After sampling
its Sunday brunch, which is rea-
sonably priced at a student’ rate
of $10, I’d have to say it’s worth
considering treating yourself on
occasion.

Apple branching,

VanBuren: Will we ever see a Mac tablet PC?

 
   

Tom VanBuren
Columnist

Trendy computer users every-
where flock to use the sleek and
sophisticated—looking MacBook
and MacBook Pro laptops. .

Despite attacks from Dell,
Hewlett—Packard and Microsoft
against Apple’s pricing structure,
consumers appear smitten with
the Macintosh operating system
environment and are eager to see
it applied in more non-tradition-
al settings.

Apple branched out a little bit
with its iPhone and iPod Touch,
providing a cut-down version of
the OS X environment for embed-
ded devices. The public_, ever de-
siring an excuse to purchase new
technology, demands more.

Apple’s competitors, namely
Toshiba, Hewlett—Packard and
Dell, all produce tablet PCs, in
addition to their traditional ev-
eryday computing laptop ranges.

Apple, however, does not appear
to be interested in the tablet.

Is this lack of overall interest
a result of some quirk ofApple’s
business model? Or is it because
the Mac OS X platform is ill—suit-
ed for a tablet en-
vironment where
the user is given
the power to draw
on the screen with
a pen, in addition '
to simple clicking
and highlight-
ing?

but is seed sown for tablet?

The result: an unofficial Ma-
cintosh tablet, capable of com-
puting as quickly as Apple’s most

up-to-date laptops, but with the .

added ﬂourish of a tablet capa-
bility.

how pppular an official Macin-
tosh tablet would be if it were
put into production.

Apple works in mys-
terious‘ ways, however.
Rumors in computer engineer-
ing circles
claim that
Apple is ac-
tually tak-

Perhaps the more rumors that circulate, '
the better chance that -Apple might
actually be working silently somewhere

to produce a tablet.

ing heed of
the public’s
shouts and
might be
attempting

Axiotron, a-
c 0 mp a ny d e —
scribed in a recent Applelnsider
magazine article, believes the OS
X environment would work just
fine as a tablet.

To prove this concept, Axio-
tron created the ModBook by
taking the thinking innards ofa
MacBook Pro — including all the
clever circuitry Apple developed
to allow its machines to run OS
X —— and put them in a new skin,
complete with a touch-enabled
screen and stylus.

“Woopdy—doo,” you might
think. “Apple will simply ignore
it and push a new model iPhone,
claiming simply that’a tablet is
unwarranted when your fingers
can interact with your cellular
telephone just fine.”

The crowd at the Macworld
Expo, however, might make Apple
rethink its strategy. Applelnsider
reported that the display of the
ModBook “drew hundreds” of
spectators, showing Apple just

to develop
a tablet for
release at the beginning of 2010.
Computerworld published a blog
about it, so there is probably
some truth to the rumor. _
Perhaps the more rumors
that circulate, the better
chance that Apple might actu-
ally be working silently some-
where to produce a tablet.
According to Computerworld,
however, an eventual Apple tab-
let PC may not be released in the
form that many people are think-

ing. The blo g reporting the early
2010 release of a tablet went
on to describe a 10-inch touch
screen design, rumored to be
circling around the engineering
dungeons of Apple.

Seth Weintraub, the author of
the blog, appeared to think that
the device would be similar to an
iPod Touch on steroids, or, when
made analogous to the PC world,
a touch—screen netbook. The

predicted cost: $500 to $700. '

Take all of these predictions with

a grain of salt. Macintosh has said _

repeatedly before that it has no in-
terest in producing a netbook or a
tablet, let a lone a tablet netbook.
So the ﬁnal net result of this dis-
cussion is mostly wishful think-
ing. Many people would love to
see Apple producing its OS X
system in a package that would
allow stylus interaction.

Apple would love to force ev-
eryone to buy iPhones for com-
munication while driving or
note—taking during meetings and
MacBooks for connection when
you are standing still.

Na Gaels no stranger tolocal ‘  

Irish 4 7

“I like to think of us as a talented group
of musicians. But I think the main part is
for people to come down and have a good

« time. I’ve never met a person who saw us

and complained.” .

And it’s no wonder, when you consider
the experience Na Gaels has playing to-
gether. May played with the group’s guitar-

' ist in a-swing band for seven years before »

forming Na Gaels — and after even more
time together, the experience paid off. '

The band now plays annually at events
such as Irish Day at Kennywood Park, the
Pittsburgh Irish Festival and a yearly ban-

quet for the Irish Center of Pittsburgh. And '

that’s all in addition to periodic gigs at local
bars, including Oakland, where Na Gaels
performed at Peter’s Pub. V '

Part of what makes Na Gaels unique is
the variety of its performances. Accord-
ing to May, the group plays everything
from lively reels (the iconic music of Irish
pubs), to traditional ballads and anything
in between. , ’

To keep it versatile, the musicians shuf-
ﬂe instruments during a set. In addition to
guitar and ﬁddle, performances feature the

‘ethnic music circles

' mandolin, Irish ﬂute and bodhran drum
music.-A female vocalist — a daughter of an
original band member — also brings a fresh
sound to the formerly all-male group.

With all this, Na. Gaels creates musicthat

, stirs ancient Irish roots — or makes audi-

ences order a pint and clap along.

freshman and played in 11 games
during the 2006 season.

But as he enters his ﬁnal sea-
son with Pitt, Byham is having as
much fun ori the ﬁeld as he does
off. And to people who know him,
that’s no surprise.

“Nate’s got great character,”
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt said.
“He does the right things off the
ﬁeld, he does the right things in
the classroom.”

Wannstedt’s words were
echoed by another one of Byham’s
coaches, tight end coach Brian
Angelichio, who said Byham’s
“passionate, great work ethic”
lead to his success as a student
and player.

“It’s a big year for him in that
it’s his senior year,” Angelichio

said. “I know he’s the kind of kid '

that will lead by example with his
performanceon the ﬁeld.”

Like his fans, Byham is still a
student who wants to have fun
when he isn’t in class.

“I usually just hang out with
my girlfriend or_ play video
games,” he said. “I just enjoy the
whole thing. I love to have a good
time.”

The team boasts 20 seniors,
including 12 starters who aim to
show the younger players on the
team what it takes to win.

And maybe nobody knows
that better than linebacker Adam

“Being a sixth—year senior, I

Men’s soccer ready to play more aggressive system

,   ‘Diana comior‘| SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
- "Senior forward Chris Wilcox will take part inithe aggressive style of
play this season. He ﬁnished 2008 with three goals and seven points.

Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

Collegiate soccer is often synony-
mous with back-and—forth action,
but for the Pitt men’s team last
season, soccer was synonymous

' with ups and downs.

While the Panthers had the
best start in their history, key
injuries plagued their roster.

Down the stretch, the depleted
personnel weighed heavily on
the team’s shoulders and led to a
stretch of defeats, despite advanc-
ing to — and ultimately losing in
— the Big East tournament.

But head coachjoe Luxbacher
said he believes that was then,
and this is now. _

“Our goal as a team is to chal-
lenge for the Big East title,” he
said. “Obviously, it’s a challenge,
but I like our team and feel that

we have the potential to do some

big things this year.”

The Panthers start the regu-
lar season today when they visit
Robert Morris.

It’s high praise, given that the

team lost forward standout E.J.
McCormick, defender Eric Jae-
ger and goaltender Eric Barnes
to graduation.

Regardless, Luxbacher said
he’s comfortable with his roster
entering the 2009 season.

“We have a deep team,” he
said. “There is going to be com-
petition for every spot, and I feel
that will make our team stronger
in the long run.”

Fora team to succeed and per-
severe, equally as important as
healthy competition is a team’s at-
titude. As far as Luxbacher is con-
cerned, his team has just that.

It will have to do so with a re-
vamped roster and tactical meth-
odology. '

In addition to welcoming three
newcomers, Alex Fischetti, Mike
Whitaker and Keegan Gunderson,
the Panthers will kick the ball with
a different purpose in mind.

' “This year, we plan on playing
a more attacking style of play,”
Luxbacher said. “We want to at-
tack more in our opponent’s end
of the ﬁeld, which will hopefully
lead to more scoring opportu-

nities. I feel this type of play is
better suited for our team, but.
in order for it to be successful,
our players need to buy into the
system and get in great shape. It
will be hard work, but I feel that
our players will be up to the chal-
lenge.”

An aggressive approach, how}
ever, should not be confused with
recklessness, nor should it come
at the expense of sound positional
defensive play. For the system to

"work, an offensive mindset and

defensive responsibility should
work in unison.

The Panthers of last season ——
and the projected bunch for 2009
—— should have no qualms about
adhering to the ever-important
defensive mindset. After all, de-
fense was one of the team’s strong
points last season.

The question, then, is how the
team will score goals, especially
given‘McCormick’s departure.

Luxbacher said he recognized
the on-the—surface shortage on
offense, but offered a potential
healer.

“We don’t have one or two su-i‘

Wannstedt’s first recruits
now in their senior year .

_ Michael Heater I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Senior offensive lineman John Maleki [left] enters his ﬁnal season. Three years ago, he
was part of Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt’s ﬁrst recruiting class.

Seniors 4 10
Interscholastic Athletic League and the
City League, which comprise the greater
Pittsburgh area.

Wannstedt wasted no time in staying
true to his promise, as he got a commit-

ment from Malecki, astar at the Pittsburgh I

area school Franklin Regional. Malecki was
one of Wannstedt’s first—prize recruits in
the class that contributed to the team’s
turnaround.

Wannstedt has been able to land so
many local players by having the Pittsburgh
area guys already on the team to show the

players in the area what Pitt has to offer.
“Coach Wannstedt will have older guys

that have been here for a while and es- _

pecially guys from the local area talk to
some of the young recruits they bring in,”
Malecki said. “Something they instill here
at the University of Pittsburgh is that fam-
ily aspect, and we just try to get the young
guys to feel comfortable.” _

The class of 2006 was highlighted by the
four—star recruit Malecki, ﬁve-start tight
end Nate Byham, four—star tight end Dorin
Dickerson, four—star cornerback Aaron
Berry and two—star Greg Romeus, who is
now a redshirt junior.

These experienced veteran players,
along with countless others from that re-
cruiting class, have been the main reason
Pitt was able to win nine games last year.
With their continual leadership over the
younger players, they will be the reason
Pitt will be able to win even more games.

Barnes returns to team, brings

perstar goal scorers on our team,”
he said. “But our team can score
goals in a variety of different ways
from a variety of players.”

Some of those goals will have
to come from senior forward
Chris Wilcox, who ﬁnished the

' season tied with McCormick in

goals.

“Chris is a player who has
shown the ability to score for
us,” Luxbacher said. “He has been
very productive in the minutes
that he played, and we hope to
get a lot of offensive production
out of him this season.”

"To help offset the loss of Mc-
Cormick, Pitt added junior Vir-
ginia Tech transfer Terry Boland
to the mix. Luxbacher said he is
conﬁdent in the type of perfor—
mance Boland might bring.

It is conceivable that the of-

“ fense will ﬂourish and the defense

will shut down opponents, but

., it would all be for nothing if the

goaltending stumbles.

 

       

Pitt lost Barnes and Jordan
Marks, who were the duo at the
goalkeeping position. Redshirt
junior Zach Matthews and fresh-
man Gunderson are left to replace
great talent at a toughposition.

Still, Luxbacher said he be-
lieves his team will be solid be-
tween the posts.

“Zach has been with the pro-
gram for a few years and had a
solid spring for us,” he said, while
“Keegan has a lot of experience
playing at the highest levels of
high school soccer.”

“Between the two, I am con-
ﬁdent we will be solid in goal,
even though neither has playing
experience in the Big East games,”
Luxbacher said.

While Barnes’ presence will
be missing from the ﬁeld, he will
have a great inﬂuence off it, as he
signed on as a graduate assistant
and a goalkeeping coach with the
team.

His leadership, knowledge

and experience will help shape
the young goalkeeping tandem
for Pitt. '1

“Having [Barnes] will really
help out [Matthews and Gunder-
son],” Luxbacher said. “Goalies,
particularly younger goalies, need
experience every day in practice.
Having a goalkeepers coach like
[Barnes] around makes me feel
conﬁdent that our goalies will
get the necessary experience
and training every time they
practice.” '

As is often the case in sports
there are as many reasons for cau—'
tion as there are for hope. The up-
coming season promises to yield
excitement, and Luxbacher said,
he’s prepared.

“We have a new team, new as—
sistants and we’re all really look-
ing- forward to the upcoming sea-
son,” he said. “There are a lot of
challenges facing us, but we know
what it’s going to take, and we’re
going to be ready to go.”
