Medical Instructor
Expands Issues In
Discrimination Charge

by DIANE McDONALD

Dr. Earl B. Smith, clinical
instructor in surgery at the
University’s Medical School
and chairman of the Urban
League Health Committee,
further emphasized to d a y

the plight of the Negro health
problem. Stressing the urgent

need for positive action, Smith,

sta_ted thatgthe vital issue sur-
pass those involved in the re-
cent NAAOP controversy.

  
   

DR. EARL B. SMI'_l‘H_
Elaborates
Discrimination Charge
These issues, presented in a
signed -statement, are as follows:
‘P Does the University School
of Medicine in its present state-
related capacity have a primary
responsibility and obligation to
eliminate the acute m-edical de-
ﬁciencies in the Negro commun-
it-ies of.Western Pennsylvania?
> Does the Medical School

A have the responsibility to recruit
‘Negro medical students with the

intent of these graduates re-

maining in the area to practice,
teach, and engage in medical re-
search?“ ‘

> Will the University attempt
to recruit qualiﬁed Negroes for
high-leveled professional posi-
tions in the medical schools?

> Is the University willing to
project qualiﬁed Negroes into
positions of authority, supervi-

‘sion and management in the

medical schools?

?> Will the University demon-
strate overall practical evidences
of an open door policy of -good
will rather than the elucidation

‘of theoretical concepts?

“These are the questions which
the University must ask itself,”
Smith continued. Having made,
along with other members -of the
committee, “recommendations to
the dean (Dean Cheever of the
Medical School) during the past
year,” he now hopes to go high-
er up on the administrative lad-
der for support, and soon hopes
to initiate official action.

“My contingent -is: let's in-

augurate an acting program to .

alleviate some of these prob-
lems . . . there must be a gen-
eralized evaluation of the entire
situation and immediate institu-
tion of corrective measures. As
a surgeon associated with the
medical school, as a citizen in-
terested in community activities
and as a chairman of the Ur-
ban League Health Committee

I have speciﬁc, recommendations.

for a new approach or a begin-
ning and I will elucidate these
measures upon request of the
officials of the University.”

TRAN VAN DIHN
Speaks on Vietnam

South Vietnamese Students
Dispute Tran War Stand

. by GABRIELLE EDWARDS

The Honorable Tran Van D-ihn, chief Washington re-
porter for the Saigon Post, sparked much controversy and
disagreement among the three South Vietnamese students

studying here at the University. These students questioned’

Tran’s change in allegiance in 1954 from the Liberation
Army of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese government.
They also challenged the authenticity of some of Tran’s
statements and inquired what sources __he used.

Nuguyen Hai Binh, former captain in the South Viet-

namese Army and present candidate for a doctoral degree in Eco-
nomic and Social Development in GSPIA, elaborated on the areas

in which he disagreed with ‘Tran.

Concerning Tran’s allegation that the peas-ant soldier in South
Vietnam is completely alienated from his French and American
trained officers, Bihn ‘said, “This is not true. Simply becausethe
officers are trained by t-he French does not mean they are cut oﬁ
from the peasant soldiers under their command. The officers art

vietnamese.”

Nuguyen also denied thepolitical sophistication of the South

Dr. Ralph Von Eckarts-z

burg, professor of psycholo-

" gy at Duquesne University,

proposed to the group gath-
ered at the Oratory Wed-
nesday night that since LSD
-is here to stay for awhile, ways
should be found to use its po-
tential constructively. He said
that "the psychedelic revolution
hits the roots of today's prob-
lems; it is a powerful force that
can effect social change.

Dr. Von Eckartsburg stated
that the use of LSD -is a revolu-

- tion-‘against “the good life” of
_ the Establishment. The envelop-
. ing “golden cage” with its em-
, phasison technological order or-

ganization, and schedules causes
the individual to feel impotent
and anonymous. Too much im-
portance is placed upon things.
Thus, an extreme of technologic-
al order becomes stiﬂing and
_re_su1ts‘ in a negative reaction. .
Through drugs the individual
can make an inroad into-‘this, or-
ganization by going inside, rath-
er than outside.‘-He can struc-
ture his ‘life’ as -t he wishes. He

nite. He can -begin to see through
the structures of our ‘society,
and there comes with this an in-
tensive examination of his rela-
tionships with others and “with
his environment.

Since LSD can be dangerous if
misused, one must prepare for
the most unbelievable voyage
one can think of. It should be
used in the presence of those

who are familiar with its ef-‘

fects; one needs a. guide in a
jungle and one needs a guide
on an LSD trip. Dr. Von Eckarts-
burg used the analogy of a. vaca-

Dr.\Von Eckartsburg said that '

“the idea of dropping out is
dangerous because once you go
in this direction, it is hard for
you to come back.” With young
people's concern for sharing,
the'y’ll move together in groups,
leave, and drop out. Dr. Von
Eckartsburg urged that they not
get “trapped in a uto-pian fan-
tasyland. If one has the skills,
he should try to change the sit-
uation organically.” Thus, LSD
can be a_strong vehicle for so-
cialchange, and‘ the results can
be extremely beneﬁcial to these-

  

  

   
   
   
 

Vietnamese peasant. He stated
that “the peasants have suffered
greatly from the 20 years of
protracted war. Their immediate

’ problem is the struggle to sur-

vive,” he stated. They want to
feed themselves and run away
from the war.

“All they want is peace, in
any form,” -said Nuguyen. ‘f-Dur-
ing the day they are bothered
by the South Vietnamese Army
to join -and support -the cause.
During the night the same vil-
lagers are threatened by the
Viet Cong,” he pointed out. It is
no wonder then that they are
afraid of both sides, said Nugu-
yen.

Nuguyen also said that the
Vietnam war is a multi-front
war. “It must be fought,” he
said, “on the political and socio-
economic as well as the mili-
tary front. In order to be suc-
cessful -in helping the South
Vietnamese, many problems
must be solved besides the mili-
tary one,” stated Nuguyen.‘

When a-sked what -he felt was
the most pressing need in Viet-

nam at the moment, Nuguyen

said “What is needed most is a
strong leader with a good image.
Whether he is- military or civili-

’ an is not important. He must

be able to unite the people and
look to the villages for support.

He must be able to rally the in-
tellectuals to win back the peas-
ants to the South Vietnamese

side. Leaders must be created.

  Tran Calls For Alteration
  0fU~S~ Viemamwa

by PAUL STOLLEB

The Honorable Tran Van
Dihn, former acting Vietna-
mese ambassador to the
United States and current

Washington bureau chief of »

the Saigon Post, said Wed-
nesday at the Midday lecture
that “the solution to the
dilemma of U. S. policy in
Vietnam is for the United States
to assist the Vietnamese in are-
ating a new political climate by
reshaping its policy.” ,
Tran said that he could not

' “see how any progress (in the

Vietnamese war) can be made
in the present -structure. The
current United States policy,”
said 'I‘ran, “is one supporting the
self determination of the Viet-
namese people. This self-deter-
min-ation policy, however, is not
really upheld because the Unit-
ed States has not prevented rig-
ged elections. The responsibility
of the United "States should »be
to insure free elections in Viet-
nam,” he pointed out.

Tran said, that “about 80 per :

cent of the Vietnamese people
want to end the War. In Viet-,'
nam the press is censoredand
the elections are rigged. 'I.'hu.s,”
said Tran, “the majority senti-.
ment is not reﬂected in the pre-
sent government. If a civilian
government were elected in Sep-

tember,” sa-id Tran, “they would '_

try to end the war. This i-s what.
the people want,” he pointed
out.

Tran also analyzed the mill- »

tary structure existing in Viet-
nam today. “The South Vietna-
mese army has no leadership
and no interest in national
goals,” said Tran. He stated that
“all the present generals of the
South Vietnamese Army were
with the French army. This has
caused an antagonism between
the military leadership and the
peasants,” said Tran (the peas-
ants form the base of the army).

“The antagonism between the ’

generals and the peasants has
caused a rnilritary leadership
prdblem. Consequently,” stated-
Tran, “the US’. army has taken
over the training of the South
Vietnamese Army.”

Tran said that “the United
States escalation of the war has

caused more alienation between  ’

the generals and troops.”
Analyzing the nature of the
Viet Cong, Tran stated the
“North Vietnamese have no real
control over the Viet Cong. A

guerilla army,” he noted, “must -,

avoid centralized connections. A
Viet Cong leader can hardly
phone Ho Chi Milm every ﬁve

minutes asking for instructions,'” . 

he stressed.
The North Vietnamese Army,
according to Tran, is the nation-

- al army of Vietnam. “It (North

Vietnamese Army) is a resis-

- tance army with a peasant  - .~-..:
In North Vietnam, ‘there is no I

A new approach has been suggested to resolving the charges of
racial discrimination lodged by the NAACP against the University’s
School of Medicine. Instead of arguing about the validity of the charges,
a. Negro clinical instructor at the school stressed the need for positive
action. .
Dr. Earl B. Smith, who also serves as chairman of the Urban
League Health Committee, raised a valid point: “Does the University's
School of Medicine in its present state-related capacity have a primary
responsibility and obligation to eliminate the acute medical deﬁciencies

in the Negro communities of Western Pennsylvania?”

There must be a careful evaluation of this question, and a decision
should be reached to either take positive steps towards remedying the
plight of the Negro or maintain the status quo, which has not nearly be-
gun to meet the needs of the predominantly Negro communities in this
area. ‘

Dr. Smith asked the following question: “Will ‘the University dem-
onstrate overall practical evidence of an open door policy or good will

' rather than the elucidation of theoretical concepts?”

There has been no evidence that there has been any discrimination
against the Negro -by our School of Medicine, but estimates on the number

i.....~i~..1»...i..

of Negro students enrolled inthe school combined with the fact that no
Negro is on the faculty reveal that no concentrated efforts have.been'
made to attract Negroes.

The officials of our School of Medicine must decide if an all-out at-
tempt to recruit Negroes should be made. If a decision favoring this kind
of action is endorsed, men of Dr. Smith_’s calibre should be included on
a planning committee to inaugurate new programs.

We concur with Dr. Smith’s statement that “There must be a gen-
eralized evaluation of the entire situation and immediate institution of
corrective measures.” The exceptionally small number of Negroes affili-
ated with our Medical Sch-ool either as instructors or students necessitates
that this problem be probed by the proper authorities.

_ We are in no position to pass judgment on a situation where we
do not possess all the facts, but the information that we have received
merits a thorough evaluation by the School of Medicine officials. Dr.
Smith declared that he had “speciﬁc recommendations for a new approach
or a beginning and I will elucidate these measures upon request of the
officials of the University.” We feel he certainly ‘should have an oppor-
tunity to do this, as should the NAACP. For the issue is too important
and affects too many people to be dropped without seriously investigating

some of the charges hurled. . _ - e

 

 

The Handicap is Here to Stay

A Challenge To Face  

(Miss Uher is'a senior anthro-
pology major who is working
toward making people aware of
the problems facing the handi-

capped student. Her article is

the first of a two-part series.)

AMONG THE facts of life
which must be faced by so-
cety is that there are mil-
lions of people who are phy-
sically handicapped in the
world today.

Many of these handicaps
are young adults who are
ready and willing to take
their rightful and responsi-

, ble place in society. We are
I in an age of new innovations,

where man has discovered
iow to send rockets to the
moon, ﬂy twice as fast as the

» speed of sound, transplant

new artiﬁcial organs into the
human body, and even teach

dolphins and chimpanzees to-
_reach a higher level in the

animal kingdom, and yet, it

_is ironical that it is so diffi-

cult for a physically handi-
capped person to ﬁnd a place

in this vast educational

realm.

The policy of our Univer-
sity on acceptng a physical-
ly disabled student lies in

- this ‘basic question, “Can the

perspective disabled student

take care of himself?” To a"

certain point this question is
vital, for indeed as in all
realms of life, there must be
placed some limitations and

_ regulations for the good of

all concerned; but this does
not eliminate the main issue
of this article. The factstill
remains that we do have stu-
dents with good minds but
disabled bodies and these
people are here to stay. They
are not an epidemic which
time will erase by the dis-
covery of anew vaccine,. but
on th e contrary, through
wars , accidents to normal
people, birth, and disease,
m-ore and more physically
disabled people will appear
on the scene. These people
who desire to reach the high-
est level of education, should
certainly receive. the oppor-
tunity to do so.

THE POLICY now held by
the University has ‘been one
with a lack of interest, there-
fore, causing a lack of fore-
sight in planning for the fu-
ture and understanding of
disabled students.

. The physically handicap-
ped student now attending
Pitt faces many social and
physical problems, but‘ so
does the normal student. Do
we turn down students who
have emotional problems? In
most cases, unless the prob-
lem is extremely severe, No!
We have a counseling serv-
ice which these emotional
disturbances are treated,
while the student goes on
with his academic curricu-
lum. The same‘ consideration

.the only difference between

them is that disability in one
is obvious, in the other it is
hidden.

Progress has been made,
true, the disabled student
has nowbeen able to get his
big toe into the doors of
higher learning without hav-
ing his toe-nail bruised. But
attached to this toe is a foot;

-belonging to a leg attached

to a human body and it cer-
tainly is time for the doors
to open wide for the handi-
capped individual. These
doors can be held open
through interest, intelli-
gence, understanding, and
the cooperati-on of many in-
dividuals and departments
within the University.

WHERE ELSE, but in _a
great University such as
ours, should these qualities
of "knowledge be exercised
and utilized. to their fullest

capacity in understanding ‘

the needs and problems of
their own students?

This understanding is not
a one-way street. It is like
a two lane ‘highway which
must_ be held open for con-
stant communication. The
normal people must learn to
understand and respect the
attitudes of the disabled but
by the same token, the dis-

abled must learn to forget

their bitterness and pride in
order that both lanes of the
highway may be cleared for
free passage. It is -only when
this highway of understand-
ing has been constructed,
that students (able and dis-
abled) will become good fu-
ture citizens and raise the
level of understanding of so-
ciety.

U.S. Vietnamese Policy

Solution for Viet  
  o By Paul Stoller

_ MEN STILL go to rallies supporting the war effort in
Vietnam. More and more automobiles proudly reveal their
red, white, and blue “Back the Boys in Vietnam” bumper

stickers. Women still worry about their sons overseas. Yet, I
i these actions should be quite unnecessary because the cur-

rent U.S. involvement in Vietnam could be brought to an
end with a little foresight and courage on the part of our
government. _

The Honorable Tran Van Dihn, Washington bureau
chief of the Saigon Post, shares this viewpoint. Tran stated
that he . . . “can’t see ‘how any progress can‘ be made with
the present structure. The United States,” he said, “sup-
ports the military junta. Under the junta there is both a
censored press and rigged elections,” Tran pointed out.

' Yet, even with this blatant recognition of the freedom
suppressing military junta, “the policy of the United States
is one of self-determination,” according to Tran.

ESSENTIALLY, THEN the United States policy is
contradictory. One facet of the policy holds that the purpose
of the U.S. intervention in Vietnampis to insure the Vietna-
mese people of a climateof freedom in which they can dem-
ocratically choose how they are to begoverned.

Unfortunately, while the U.S. pretends to believe in se-
curing a climate of freedom, it is, at the same time, support-
ing a government which pays no heed to freedom.

What, then, is the key‘ issue that confronts the U.S. I

today in Vietnam? That issue is politics. According to Tran,
“about 81 per cent of the people in South Vietnam want to
end the war.” In fact, “if a civilian government were elect-
ed,” 'I‘ran pointed out, “they would try to end the war.”

THE MILITARY junta, however, will not give up its
power very easily. Recently, the National Assemlbly of South
Vietnam was discussing the validity of the military junta.
While the discussion was going on, the junta thought it
necessary to surround the National Assembly Building with
troops. They also dispatched the police to patrol the con-
ference room where the deliberations were taking place!

The junta has also labeled some fo-rmer heads of gov-
ernment as French citizens. This, legally disqualiﬁes them
from seekng office in the government.

No one can really deny that the South Vietnamese mili-
tary junta is quite an unpopular regime. It supports the war
that 81 per cent of the people are against. It disqualiﬁes
able leaders from" seeking public office. It surrounds the-
National Assembly to insure the so-called order of its de-
li-berations. This is a blatent cause of -dictatorial suppression.

IF THE Vietnamese political instability is to be rem-

edied, a popular government must be elected in South Viet- .

nam. Therefore, free elections must be insured.

. Tran believes that the only way that free elections can
beinsured is for the United States’ to make sure that the
elections are .not rigged. That is, for the United States to
officiate the national elections. ‘

With free elections, the people of South Vietnam would

elect a popular and legitimate government that would rep- .

resent the wants of the people, according to Tran. “It’s about
time,” said Tran, “people begin to seriously think about the

irrational nature of U.S. policy. There is a need to re-shape ’

the current policy and thus foster a new political climate in
South Vietnam,” said Tran. This climate would be one of
popular government.

THERE. CAN be no doubt that burdens of the Vietna-
mese situation (instability) ~weigh heavy _on the heads of
U.S. policy makers. Yet, with a bit of foresight and a great
deal of courage, the United States could solve the essential
problem in Vietnam—political instability. _ . _

Needless to say, President Johnson and his fellow poli-

cy makers should re-shape their policy because now the I
‘stakes are high. The stakes are peace in’tVietnam«. ~ *

Grid Future Discussed

Stockton Analyzes Sports Picture

by MIKE BROURMAN .

According to Dick Stockton the least impressive aspect of the
Pittsburgh sports scene -is “the fear of criticism on the part of
the teams here.”

.But, if -the typical -Pittsburgh sports reporter tiptoes lightly
across the ﬁeld of criticism, there is at least one man who doesn’t
ﬁt the mo1d—Dick Stockton. ’

“No one wants to be_ criticized” but it deﬁnitely would make
this a better sports town,” -says Stockton,.a 1964 graduate of Syra-
cuse University who came here six months ago to head KDKA-TV’s
sports team. E

As if to prove his point, Stockton then proceeded to discuss

sports in the same manner as he does in his commentaries and on 1

his Sports Contact show. What he says is always interesting and
often provocative. ‘

“It’s obvious that this town will only support a winner,” he
comments. “Otherwise why don’t the Steelers and ‘Pitt sell out the '
Stadium -and why don’t the Pirates draw‘when they are not going
well?”

It follows, therefore, that for University sports to succeed ﬁ-
nancially they must produce winning teams. Can they do it? Stock-
ton thinks so. He believes that both football and basketbaﬂl can
reach the top again, but only if some changes are made.

“I have no doubt that Dave Hart is a good coach and that in
:1 few years he is going to have one of the top teams in the nation,”
Stockton asserts. “But before Pitt becomes a consistent _ winner,
they must loosen up that schedule.

“They always criticize Alabama for their schedule, but it's just
being s-mart if you don’t play ten tough teams, A great team could
go 5-5 with a sch.edu1e like Pitt’s. What is needed -is a representa-

tive schedule -but not an overpowering one. -

“This year Pitt has no breather,” Stockton continued. “Notre
D\ame would have trouble with that schedule. You've got to have
those tbreathers. When I was at Syracuse we had Holy Cross and
Colgate on our schedule. One year we had George Washington also,
and another year we had Virginia Tech. ’I'hat’s what Pitt needs too.

“Every team, even a great one, has letdowns and that’s what
breathers are for. Pitt’s in a tough situation that way.”

Still, Stockton sees a lot of hope for the future of Pitt football.
“Dave Hart's recruited two ﬁne freshman teams back to back, and
that is awfully hard to do. Right now Pitt is a breather for teams
like UCLA and Notre Dame, but it won't always be that way.”

Basketball, says Stockton, is in a less healthy state. “Basket-
ball at the college level is negligible here. It should be big tho-ugh.
All they need are good attractions and they’ll draw. Just look at
the Roundball Classic if you don’t believe me.

“The Steel Bowl right now is nothing. But, if the Dapper Dan
Club takes it over, as it might, it could be big. It should be an eight
team to1u'nament, and I think that’s what they have in mind. I
understand the Dapper Dan has already contacted USLCA about
1968.” s

As for Panther basketball, Stockton had a quick remedy in
mind. “They should ﬁre the coach (Bob Timmons). I don’t think
he is very good. A coaches main job is to recruit, and he hasn’t

done it. It -takes more than knowing -basketball to be successful. He 1

also has to instill spirit and Timmons doesn’t seem to do that.

“Good recruiting and lots of ‘spirit can cover up a lot of coach-
ing mistakes, but the most knowledgeable coach in the world can’t
win with a team that has no talent and no spirit.”

Educational, Rewarding

_ by ANNE DORN

Wearing a pin that is a
souvenir or her stay in Mex-
ico, Mary Foley enthusiasti-
cally described the duties
and-the gains of the YMCA
Mexico Workshop in a re-
cent interview. Miss Foley, a
junior political science major,
was one of 12 University stu-
dents who volunteered for the
‘mont-h’s stay in Mexico. She
stated that the students were
divided into two groups of six
each. One group s-tayed in Tor-
reon, and her group stayed in
Chihuahua.

'_ ‘In Mexico,” continued Miss

Foley, “there are three Y’s: -one
in Torreon, one in Mexico City,
-and one in Chihuahua. The Chi-

. _ huahua Y is very well planned.

We ﬁt int-o their" programs and
set up some of our own. English
was the main attraction. I taught

. English to beginners, helped as-

sist womens’ volleyball classes,
and taught square dancing.”
Miss Foley noted that “the

' purpose of all YMCA overseas

projects is to give students a

cross-cultural exchange. The stu-
dent learns from the culture and
the culture learns from't-he stu-
dent. This is done through work
camps.

“As a supplement to our own
program, we were active in the
Salvation Army Orphanage. It
was run by one woman who-
took care of 45 children. We
helped by making improvements
in the orphanage house. We
made chalkboards, checker-
boards, dresses and shirts, and
called in a plumber.”

Miss Foley explained that the
volunteers were from the Uni-

‘versity YMCA, although they

received some assistance from
the Metropolitan YMCA. “To
prepare for the trip, We attend-
edpseminars from October

through April. The ﬁrst half we
learned about ourselves; the sec-
ond half we learned about Mexi-
co. It was the type -of program
that gave the student the oppor-
tunity to see the culture not as
a tourist, but to become part of
that culture.”
