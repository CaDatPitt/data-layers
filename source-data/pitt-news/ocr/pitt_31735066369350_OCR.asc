National Scholastic Aptitude"
Test scores of incoming fresh-
men at Pitt have declined over
the past ten years.

According to the Office of
Institutional Research,_ SAT
scores have been on the
downswing nationally, with the
drop reflected at Pitt.

Nationally, the medianscore
on. verbal tests has dropped
from an average of 478 in 1968

8 to 429 in 1978; the mathematics
median has dropped from 502
to 470. .

Since 1968, the verbal score
of Pitt freshmen has declined
from 556 to the present 480,
and the mathematics score
from 572 to 530.

Beginning in 1967, the
combined scores of Pitt fresh-
men have ‘dropped by about 10
points a year, according to
Institutional Research records,
except for 1978 combined
scores, which dropped 40
points from the 1977 scores
(from 1,050 to 1,010). .

Although this 40 point drop-
seems to indicate Pitt has
lowered its admission require-
ments, it could also be a
one-year phenomenon. Scores
forl979 should shed further
light on this subject.

Betsy Porter, associate dir-
ector of admission and student
aid, feels that the 1978 drop
could have been caused by
“office problems within the
new administration,” since the

new director, Joseph A.
Merante, has been in office
only since July 5, 1978, and
there was some confusion over
the off1ce’s newa recruitment 4
approach. The Admissions
Office is now a more service-
oriented office, she said.

“We’re trying to personalize
the admissions process,” said
Porter. “We do more
informing now and are trying to
point out the many programs
Pitt has to offer so as to get as
many qualified applicants as
possible.” A

This push to make admis-
sions more personalized is part

If , of an overall effort -to meet the

expected enrollment ﬁgures
that the university compiles.

JCAS Council Revie.wsAIternative CurricuIumpProgram

B.'v JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of,Arts and Sciences
Council voted Wednesday 5-4 to
recommend the continuation of the
AlternativeCurriculum program to
the dean of Fine Arts and Sciences,
Jerome Rosenberg. _ ’

The council previously discussed

discontinuing the program due to .
declining enrollment and the.

current financial crisis. ,
Prior to the meeting, Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences Irwin
Schulman said, “If Council votes to
continue the Alternative Curricu-
lum program,‘ I’ll take that as a

,. .mandate to ‘do as much as .1

possible can to convince Dean

 

The owner of the Chances R. tavern, slte of a the last week that dalihed two

\Rosenberg to continue the pro-

gram.” ,

A majority of the 20 students in
the program were present, along
with the program’s coordinators
and some of the faculty’ involved.

Schulman distributed a copy of a
proposal presented to him concern-
ing Alternative Curriculum which
he called “a genuine effort on the
part of the people in the ‘program to
help answer Councilfs questions.”

Schulman ‘then presented his
own revised version of the proposal
which stated that CAS Council
recommends that the Alternative
Curriculum beicontinued with some
changes.

Those changes proposed include: ,

The owner of the” Chances R-
tavern, site of a fire that claimed
two lives, was chargedlwednesday
with violating the city building
code. ' A .

Ernest Smalis, owner of the
tavern building that also housed
seven apartments, will face
‘charges ﬁled in the city Housing
Court, ‘according to Paul Imhoff,
superintendent of the city Bureau
of Building Inspection.

The charges stemmed from
alleged improprieties in electrical
work’ done in the building, located
at 112 Bouquet Street, in 1977

without the necessary city permits. 0

Two residents of one gutted
apartment, Dale Burton, 25, and
Judith Ann Ross, 22, died in the
fire that broke out early Feb. 12 on
the first floor of the tavern.

Imhoff said the building code

resolution before the vote to
continue the program for at least
two years, after which it will be
subject to review.

Members of the program present
at the meeting argued to keep the
program due to its unique
structure. ‘ ~

' Council members Richard Smet-
therst and Ian Campbell saidithey
were impressed with the turn-out
of students as well as the program
itself. »

“There has been more develop-
ment of intellectual skills than I had
been lead‘ to believe,” Smettherst
said. “Just becauseithe program
doesn’t exist for-everyone is no

violations are not directly related to
the fire, which, according to fire
officials,‘ was caused by an
overheated gas furnace in the
tavern. A A

Imhoff said the electrical work in
question was done following
another fire that destroyed the
Cum Laude Lounge in May, 1976.
The repairs were allegedly made“
without the proper city credentials.

According to Fire Chief Thomas
Kennelly, there have been four
fires in the building, including ones’
in August and October of 1971.
Arson was suspected in the
October fire and Smalis was fined
$1,000 for criminal contempt by a
federal judge when he failed to
comply with a subpeona ordering
him to appear as a witness in the
case. '

The building has been inspected

a while you have to take a chance to

“I have been impressed by the 0'

kinds of things going on and I think “
that these st-udents are receiving a

good education,”
“I’d hate to see the university go

out of its way to destroy this "
program.” 9  --

he continued. ’, K '

According to program co-7 . 

coordinator Gail McGloin, a major

problem of the program lies. in ;

recruiting faculty.

“When we get someone willing .

to come into Alternative Curricu-
lum, the department and somtimes

the dean is unwilling to release that . H“

Now that the amount of college
students nationwide is expect-
ed to drop, Porter said, the
competition for these fewer
students is becoming fiercer
and Pitt wants to be as
accessible as possible.

i “I wouldn't call this ap-
proach beating the bushes for
applicants but there is a
pressure to meet enrollment
needs,” said Porter. “There
would -be pressure on us if we
came -‘up 500 students under
last year's enrollment. ”

Though the reasons for this

drop in SAT scores may be
varied, the drop continued to
be a problem at Pitt. Those
students with low math or
verbal scores may find college
work to be difficult.

The university has attempted
to help such students with
school work. Janet Levy, in
charge of the Individualized
Reading/Open Lab at the
Learning Skills Center, said
help is offered in areas of
vocabulary, comprehension,
specialized reading, listening
and notetaking.

‘taken by all

“Each student takes a
Nelson-Denny (English) diag-
nostic test similar to the one
incoming Pitt
freshmen during orientation.
From the test, I am able to see
the areas that the student
needs help in,” Levy said.

An individualized program,
designed to correct any prob-
lems a particular student may
have with English, is develop-
ed by the lab using resources
available, she added.

According to a study pre-
pared by the lab, approxi-

Scholastic Aptitude Test Scores Drop 40 Points Sincel 977

mately 80 percent of the
students participating believed
the individualized program has
helped in eliminating their
problems.

Paralleling the English lab is
the Math Workshop, also a part
of the Learning Skills Center.

According to Susan Schiller,
coordinator, the Math Work-
shop particularly deals with
students having problems with
math courses.

“After a student consults his
teacher or assistant and he still
needs clarification (on a parti-

cular math problem or proce-
dure), he should come to us,”
Schiller said.

“We work mainly through
the 3A and 3B, math‘classes
offered through the math
department. We have specially
trained tutors who can give
more individualized h_elp.
Math 3A and 3B are for those
students who need help with‘
their math and not for those
looking for an easy A,” she
said. A

The program is registered
good by participating students.

Study Urges University To Build

Oakland Directions, lnc.,
an urban study group, urged
the University of Pittsburgh
Wednesday to construct addi-
tional undergraduate housing
and parking lots, and to
remodel Schenley Hall.-,

A planning committee of
Oakland Directions presented a
study at a public forum that

300 to 400 spaces of on-campus
housing and 1,300 to 1,900
new parking spaces in and
around campus.

Targeted by the proposal is a
stretch of land on Darragh
Street above Fifth Avenue.
where 1,100 to 1,700 parking
spaces would be located at the
intersection of Forbes Avenue

and Craig Street. _

At the intersection of Craig
and Centre Avenue, where two
empty lots are presently
located, spaces for 50 more
cars would be created.

The proposal advocates con-
struction of additional under-
graduate housing in a complex
located in front of Pitt Stadium.

Pitt Professors Author Book

Two Pitt professors have co-authored a self-help guide
for business managers to evaluate the level of stress
experienced in a business atmosphere.

“The Executive Survival Manual,” written by Thomas
V. Bonoma and Dennis P. Slevin, both associate professors

at the Graduate School of Business, uses the device of the

imaginary corporation whose vice president of manufac-
turing is buckling under the strain of a difficult executive
environment. A-'

Through this fictional character the authors analyze the
components of a successful executive personality, such as
time management, motivation of subordinates, leadership,
organizational qualities and the ability to negotiate.

Oriented towards behavior modiﬁcation, the manual has
a workbook format. A series . of simple tests, action
checklists, charts and exercises are included to help size-up
overall performance in both professional and personal life.
There are a variety of suggestions based on research data
for improving performance. I

.The ‘Real’ Role of Policein Society A  

the solution to police murder is
“better” trained cops. But the
issue hereisp not thetraining of
police, -but what they are trained
for; that is, their role and function
is society. L ‘ ' '

The police are a tool of organized
violence for the protection of

private property,‘ not people- .

Federal crime statistics show that
while police are reducing the
number of crimes against property
(like theft) they seem powerless to
prevent crimes against people (like
rape and murder) which continue to
rise unchecked.

The most important property,

which the police must protect and

keep privately-owned are the,

factories, mines, natural resources,
and transportation. This is clearest
when striking workers are attacked
by the police, or when the police
ride shotgun for scabs.

Nor are the police the last of the
rugged individuals as they are
portrayed on television. There are
113_ agencies on the_ federal level
that deal directly - with law
enforcement (1/3 of these agencies
did not exist eight years ago). I
. , g 1’

Under these circumstances. what
can the call for “better" cops mean
except more repression? Our
society hasalways been racist with
blacks and other oppressed nation~
alities on the bottom. The ability of
the capitalists to force black
workers into the low-paying jobs is
used by them to depress the living
standards of all working people.
But then. the capitialists have to
face the fact that if those on the
bottom move. everybody else
moves with them. So police
repression is always directed
primarily against blacks and other
oppressed nationalities. The police
kill an average of one person a day.

whites. ‘Chicanos. the fastest

growing national group in the
country, also have the fastest rising
rate of murder at the hands of the
police. I O ‘

Students should be aware that
the pattern of police repression
repeats. itself on campus. For
instance, an investigation into the
Campus Police in 1976 showed that
70 percent of all arrests made by
the campus police involved blacks.
The role of the campus cops is no
different than that of any other
police force: they are here to
protect private property. _While
carloads of campus cops are
‘assigned to chase down Iranian
students who are posting leaﬂets in

’ support of the Iranian revolution,

there are only two campus cops
assigned to the Towers-Quad area
at any one time. Even the rape and
murder of Monica Jones doesn't
move the university to shut down
blatant security leaks like the

tunnel into the Lothrop Dorms.

The only effective answer to the
situation existing in Pittsburgh and
on the Pitt campirs is community
self-defense. People must be
organized to defend themselves

and to resist police attack and‘

harrassment. .

The Hayes coalition is made up

of a wide variety of groups that '

have I come together -—to demand
justice in his murder and an end to
all police repression. The coalition
is demanding an investigation into
the shooting. conviction of Quick.
compensation to the Haye's family
and an end to all police repression
and brutality. To meet these
demands, the coalition is preparing
to fight on two fronts: the courts
and the community. By pressuring
the courts to deal fairly with an
open murder and by setting up the
mechanisms of self-defense in the
community. the coalition is working
to- stem the rising tide of police

  Defending Pitt’s Alternative Curriculum Program
Questions for Dean Schulman...

As an undergraduate teaching
assistant in the Alternative Curri-

culum program, I was disgusted-

and angeredgby the article which
appeared‘ in The Pitt News on
Friday, Feb. 16 concerning the
program.

Talk of regeneration should
apply to the College of Arts and
Sciences rather than the program.
When I think of some of the classes
I have taken and am taking
now—c1asses where students sit in
a lecture hall, talk to each other,
make fun oftthey professor, doodle
or write letters to friends while the
professor Iectures——it seems this is
where some change is needed.

If that is the kind of situation you
call “learning”, that is really a

shame. Also, having been in
Alternative Curriculum my fresh-
man year, I have been and still see,
“true learning” taking . place.
I have rarely heard of a workshop in
Alternative Curriculum described
as boring or a waste of time and
money. ,

In a’ quote from the article Dean
Irwin Schulman stated the program
was “all but moribound and can't
stay the way it is now.”

I think that is a pretty strong
statement for someone to make
who was only at the center once for
only an hour to talk about China.
The same goes for Ms. Jaworski,

CAS council member, who said,‘

“Students are receiving credit for

activities no department in CAS

99

could justify giving credit for.

I don’t know how Jaworski or
anyone can judge the quality of this
program when they have never
participated in a workshop or any of
the many other aspects of the
program. Yet ‘Jaworski and
Schulman feel qualiﬁed to make
statements such as these.

All the changes the council is
proposing are those which we have
beenasking for. We would love
more students involved in the
program but how do we expect
them to know about it when CAS
does little to nothing to support or
advertise the program? Many

faculty members ﬁnd it difficult to.

get release time from their

In Response to ‘Spreading the Good News’

The recent article in The Pitt
News entitled “Spreading ‘Good
News’ With Big Names, ”' by Laurie
D.T. Mann,’ contained a number of
erring. and muddled statements
concerning Christianity. The main
catalyst from which most of the
errors stem
ignorance of the nature of the
gospel (Good News) as taught in
the Bible. V

The simple statement of the
gospel is given to us in Paul’s 1

I - Corinthians 15: 1.12.

“Now brothers, I want to remind
you of the gospel I preached to you,-
which you received and on which
you have taken your stand.
By this gospel you are saved, if you
hold firmly to the word I preached
to you,‘ otherwise, you have
believed in vain. .

For what I received I passed on
to you as of first importance:
that Christ died for our sins
according to the scriptures, that he
was buried, that he was raised on
the third day according to the
scriptures, and that he appeared to
Peter, and then to the twelve.
After that, he appeared to more
than 500 of the brothers at the
same time. . .this is what we preach,
and this is what you believed.”

The Bible teaches that all people
have sinned and the payment for
sin is death. But God so loved the
world that he took on human ﬂesh,
died in place of man and rose from
the dead, proving he is God. This is
the “Good News”. God offers us
eternal life free, by simply trusting
in the ﬁnished work of his son
Jesus Christ.

Strangely enough, people have
tried to equate Christianity with a

standable in that many people who '

call themselves “Christian” feel
that being church members,

“ following certain religious rituals of

trying to “be good” will somehow
attain for them salvation.

Religion is man attempting‘ to
reach God by “good works” and

‘proper behavior (self-righteous-

ness). In contrast, Christianity is
God reaching to man through Jesus
Christ. The living God says that
our own “works of righteousness”
are ﬁlthy rags in his sight. The
only way to God ‘is on his terms
which are marvelously simple and
merciful. ‘ _
Receiving Jesus Christ as per-
sonal savior is amatter of simple
prayer in which you acknowledge

’ your sinfulness, accept Christ’s

substitutionary death ‘and thank
him for it. This is not a “blind’7
leap of faith (and again has nothing
to do with ‘‘religion’‘), but 'is,based
on‘ the facts and historical truthpof
the Bible as the word of God.

Another article could be written
on the overwhelming historical and
scientiﬁc evidence supporting the
Bible, however_; two .excellent
volumes on the subject; listing
sources, are Josh McDowell’s
“Evidence That Demands A
Verdict” and “More Evidence

L That Demands A Verdict.”

Don’t .base your faith on any
inner feeling, because inner
feelings are never honest. Don’t

. base your faith on TV, evangelists

with shiny gold lapel pins or those
who speak with ﬂowery charisma,

like Jim Jones (who was “not a

Christian but a Marxist).. Base
your‘ faith instead on the word of
God, for: “All men are like grass,

and their glory like the ﬂowers of
the ﬁeld; the grass withers and the

ﬂowers fall, but the word~of the
Lord stands forever (Isaiah 40:6-

8).”

As for the cartoon, if you classify

pies, love beads and miniskirts as
“vanishing remnants of the ‘60s,”
then you may as well add
responsibility, self-respect, initia-
tive, active learning and many

more because that is what

about the program, I would advise
you to come up to room 502, Old

...and The Pitt News

The purpose of the press was
seen by the late John F. Kennedy
to be to inform and to» “...indicate
our crisis and our choices...”
This is one area in which The Pitt
News has failed, most notably over
the recent issue of the future status
of the Alternative Curriculum
program. -

The Pitt News has poorly, if

indeed at all, represented the role .

of the Alternative Curriculum
program in the College of Arts and
Sciences. In: read, it has chosen to
present to the public the biased
opinion of Dean Schulman, who, to
say the least, has not given the
program his honest consideration.

I was present at the Alternative '

Curriculum meeting in which
Schulman was to evaluate the
program’s weekly meetings. He

-arrived approximately 20“ minutes

late and was interrupted by a
phone call during which it -became

apparent that he had planned a '

luncheon date, for the same
meetingtime. I do not believe that
he would have made his appear-
ance had it not been for a phone
call from a program advisor ten
minutes after the meeting had’

started. .
In The Pitt News article of

Friday, Feb. 16, _Schulman charged

that the program had inadequate P

faculty involvement. This charge is

ridiculous. Never in my classroom

experience have I met a faculty
more concerned and involved with
the learning experience.

> This faculty involvement has so

aroused student interest that most
Alternative Curriculum students
are voluntarily participating in
more than the required number of
workshops. -Of what other program
in the university can this be said?
Schulman’s statement that the
Alternative Curriculum workshops

laughable. My main problem, as a
student- in the Alternative, Cur-
riculum program, is keeping ..up
with the rapid pace of the other
students in my workshops. They
are willing and motivated to do
more than the workshops require
because the program is ﬂexible in
allowing them to explore individual
interests. '
Finally, I cannot see “how
Schulman can criticize the program
for giving ‘ credit for ﬁeldwork
workshops. These students meet

every week to discuss their

involvement in outside work in the
community. “Experience” is
invaluable in the job market today
and a program that is adaptable
enough to allow for job experience
deserves to be applauded, not
eliminated. ‘

I trust that The Pitt News, in the/.
treatment of such controvesial
issues in thepfuture, will be -more
careful to clearly present both sides
of these ‘issues, to “...indicate our

there are two sides,to every issue,

‘Deer Hunter,’ ‘Heaven’ TopOscar Nominees

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor

Last. year, Oscar speculation focused on Woody Allen
tieing Orson Welles’ record three Academy Award
nominations for writing, directing and acting in the 1941
“Citizen Kane.” Allen, who picked up two Oscars'(Best
Director and Best Screenplay) for his efforst in “Annie
Hall,” is in the running again in those categories for
“Interiors.” ' . I

But the big news this year is Warren Beatty , nominated
in the same categories as Welles and Allen, which gives
him the chance to become the Academy’s ﬁrst three-time
winner in the filmmaking categories.

Another record _on the line is most wins by an actress.

- Ingrid Bergman and Katherine Hepburn are the only three
time winners, but Bergman, nominated as Best Actress for
“Autumn Sonota" could become the ﬁrst four-time winner
among the thespians. «- '

The nominations are as follows:

Best Picture: “The Deer Hunter,” “Coming Home,”
“Midnight Express?” “Heaven Can Wait” and
‘ ‘Interiors. ’ ’ _

Best Actor: Beatty_ (“Heaven Can Wait,” Robert De
Niro (“The Deer Hunter”), Gary Busey (“The Buddy Holly
Story”) and Jon Voight (“Coming Home").

Best Actress: Bergman (“Autumn Sonota”), Jane

Fonda (“Coming Home”), Jill Clayburgh (“An Unmarried
Woman”), Ellen Burstyn (“Same Time, Next Year”) and
Geraldine Page (“Interiors”).
Best Supporting Actor: Jack Warden (“Heaven Can
Wait”), Bruce Dern (“Coming Home”), Christopher
Walken (“The Deer Hunter”), John Hurt (“Midnight
Express”) and Laurence Olivier (“The Boys From
Brazil”).

Best Supporting Actress: Dyan Cannon (“Heaven Can
Wait”), Maggie Smith (“California Suite”), Maureen

Stapleton (“Interiors”) and Meryl Streep (“The Deer
Hunter”).

_“The Deer Hunter” and ‘Heaven Can Wait” gathered
the most nominations -- nine -- both including the primary
actrng awards, best screenplay and best director.

The Deer Hunter” won top prizes at the New York
Drama Critics Awards in December, including Best Picture
and Best Actor.

“Heaven Can Wait” is a remake of the 1941 “Here
Comes Mr. Jordan” and is a fantasy -- _a light contrast to
the other nominated films which deal with grimmer subject
matter. “The Deer Hunter” and, “Coming Home” are
bleak looks at Vietnam, “Interiors” deals with the

. alienation of an upperclass family and ‘Midnight Express”

is about an American tourist imprisoned in Turkey for
smuggling hashish.

' The awards are slated to be telecast on ABC April 9.

_ “McGuinn, Clark and Hillman,”
however, is not a Byrds album and
it would be unfair to consider it as
such. Rather, it is an album of

Jazz-—where it’s meant to be

played, and how it’s meant to be
heard—was . presented last

‘Wednesday night at Wobblie Joes

in Southside when the Roger
Humphries quintet, the Rh Factor,
performed.

The Rh Factor consists of Pete
Henderson on trumpet, Dick Lilly
on sax, Jay Spencer on keyboards,
Cal Ewing on, bass and Humphries
on drums. .

Humphries has played with Ray
Charles, Horace Silver and Stanley
Turrentine. Although the other

- Sete-like strumming-—not so.

Gil is given the full-blown
Hollywood production, complete
with studio mainstays like Don
Grusin and Lee Rittenhour. There
are also many Brazilian players and
the fusion of such disparate
musical styles does not work too
often.

The opener, “Sarara,” is sung in
Portugese; as are most of the other

‘songs, but it has a reggae beat and

band members_ do not have as
extensive a backround,’ all are
competent musicians.

The Rh Factor plays a relaxed
neo-bop jazz, performing numbers
by Freddie Hubbard, The Crusa-
ders and others," plus its own
compositions and arrangements.

There is something special about i

jazz in a small club, a quality apart
from the competence of the
musicians or variety of songs. A
close rapport develops between the
musicians and the audience, as if
the band is playing in your own
"living room.

That relationship was [missing

is loaded down with the obligatory
synthesizers. The diverse concepts
don't mesh well.

“Goodbye My Girl” again
squeezes the Brazilian Gil into a
Jamaican Reggae. He even sounds
like a drugged Bob Marley.

“Ella” is an improvement,
mainly because the Brazilian
musicians contribute some densely
textured percussion work, remini-
scent of early 1970s Santana.

“Balafon” is side one’s high

through the first two sets. The
musicians seemed uninvolved and
unenthusiastic about their music.
Humphries complained about the
acoustics and they were not the
best. The stage at Wobblie Joes is
deep and narrow, almost cavelike.

Somehow Humphries turned it
around on the third set. The band
just took control of the audience.
All conversation stopped as all

- attention focused on-the band and

its music.

Grimaces evident on the musi-
cians’ faces through the first two
sets were replaced by smiles and
grins after particularly good riffs.

Premiere artists of the new wave, The Remones, will be at
the Decade Mar. 6-7. The band ls, from left to right, John-
ny, Marky, Joey and Dee Dee Ramona;

point; it is a pure samba with Gil
scat-singing in Portugese. The
whole number is propelled by the
percussion and is a very good
representation of a Rio carnival.
Side two’s “Maracata Atomico”
ﬁnally features Gil’s guitar for
about four seconds. There seems
to be steel drums in the

background but the vocals drown ‘

them out. The title song has a
strange descending melody but the
ﬂat lyrics don’t help.

Henderson's look of boredom was
replaced by a look of ecstacy as all
the members of the band became
involved. . ,
The sense of involvement and
excitement spread like electricity
through the audience/. Knees
"bounced, ﬁngers tapped and heads

nodded with the music. ‘And that .

mysterious link of musical com-
munication established itself.

The Rh Factor played three more
sets, each one better than the last.

’ Particularly .exciting moments were

the sax trumpet duet on “Someday
My Prince Will Come”—when Lilly
and Henderson invoked the im-

“Samba De Los Angeles” is

It would be nice to hear Gil in an
untampered setting, surrounded by
his fellow Brazilians and playing
his country’s folk and pop tunes.
The only completely satisfying cuts
on “Nightingale” are the ones that
come closest to this ideal.

Gillespie-—and Humphries’ drum
solo on “Green Dolphin Street.”
Humphries whole body became
an extension of the drum set.

They closed out the evening with
a scorching arrangement of Gersh-
wins’ “Summertime” and it did
not seem out of place when a deep
feminine voice from the audience
began to sing the refrain.

‘ ‘When vou love itas much as we
do it gets easy up there,”
Humphries said. The band's love
of its music was clear for all to see.
That love might be the essence of
the musical link.

“Little Mama” follows. It’s an
excellent number that features a
great sax part that compliments the
rhythm section.

Next is “Don’t You Write Her
Off,” a- tune » composed by
McGuinn. The ambivalent lyrics
suggest. that the song is_ a
retrospective of McGuinn’s career

.but also a simple story of lost love.

Side one closes with two really
nice pieces, “Surrender to Me”
and “Backstage Pass.”

“Stopping Traffic” begins side
two with a brisk, up-tempo,
rock’n’roll beat.

“Feelin’ Higher” opens up as a
samba-type tune that later gives
way to a standard ballad, then

“Sad Boy” is staccato rocker

The 'next cut, “Release Me,”

  Pitttﬂosts Rutgers

Cagers Try for Twelfth Home Win

By CRIS HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

The result of tonight’s Pitt-
Rutgers basketball game (Field
ﬂlouse, 8 p.m.) holds so much
importance to Eastern Eight
standing that it might be possible
to overlook the fine 40 minutes of
basketball one can expect to
precede the discovery of a winner
and a loser.

Such an oversight would ignore
the fact that this game will match
the league’s finest pair of teams
(according to overall records) and
two of its three most talented
performers. (Lowes Moore is in
Washington for tomorrow’s West
Virginia - Goerge Washington
game). I '

Rutgers has been the pre-season
(and pro-tournament) pick to win
the Eastern Eight during each of
the league’s three seasons of
existence. But Duquesne and
Villanova have been the league’s
delegates to the NCAA tournament

while Rutgers has been an early-

victim of each league tournament.
(The Scarlet Knights finished third
at last year’s National Invitation
Tournament.)

This seasQn’s Knights, paced by
senior center James Bailey, are
17-9, but their league record (6-3)
is such that a loss tonight might
.deny them a home-court advantage

Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt's women’s basketball team
will again try for a regional bid
tonight when eastern powerhouse
Rutgers visits the Field House in a

’ doubleheader with the men’s team.

Pitt’s chances took a beating
Tuesday when the Pantherettes
were defeated by Villanova, .70-64.
‘The Pantherettes have been
troubled by a lack of scoring.

“The Villanova game was very
close throughout the night,” said

coach Jean Balthaser, “but in the

last three minutes we just couldn’t
score. We must of had at least ﬁve
opportunities to win the, game at
that point but we just couldn’t
score.” '

Besides the lack of offensive
scoring in crucial minutes, the
Pantherettes also had other pro-
blems. Pitt couldn’t get the

offensive rebounds.

“We were having some pro-
blems towards the end because we
started making mental errors
defensively,” said Balthaser. “We
started to break down and
Villanova just took advantage of the
situation. We were trying to rush
the ball offensively and force

scoring, but we couldn’t maintain 3
our composure through it.

‘ “'l:he_r_e is still a slim chance for

us to receive a regional bid,” said
Balthaser. “but it will depend on
our performance tonight. A win will
make our chances really good. -

Even a good showing will have
great signiﬁcance

voting. ’ ’

Rutgers, ranked within the
nation’s top ten teams, has the
highest scoring percentage in the
East with a 86.8 points scored per

in the ﬁnal

game average.

coaches Rick (left) and Balthaser.

 

. Eastern Eight Plays ‘Musical Standings’

Tonight’s the night but what will take place on the
Field House basketball court,probabiy" wouldn’t in-
terest Rod Stewart very much. ,

There are four teams in the.‘ Eastern Eight that
could be considered the favorite to win a trip to the

f NCAA tournament in March.

Villanova made the Eastern Eight look good last
year after itwon the league tournament and advan-
ced to the Eastern regional finals. Despite a slightly
better than .500 overall record, the lWildcats have

j-clinched the regular season championship and for
this reason alone might be considered a contender for
the post-season bid. T

However, the Pitt-Rutgers game tonight boils
down to the league’s most important contest because
it will decidethe pairings for next week’s opening
round, of the tournament. West Virginia still must

' play George Washington in theynation’-s capital and

Penn State’ 'will play Duquesne at the Civic Arena but

if the two games turnout as expected, Pitt can make -

the standings a bit less complicated by winning
tonight.

_ Rutgers was embarrassed by losing in the first
round of the Eastern Eight last season but was good
enough to come back and finish third in the National
Invitational tournament. With All-America forward
James Bailey, leading the; way, the Scarlet Knights

0 the Run

also have a‘ strong possibility of claiming the league
title they were so heavily favored to win last year.

Of course, George Washington cannot be counted
out. The Colonials came within two points of upset-

ting nationally-ranked Georgetown two nights ago.

In Eastern Eight play; GW defeated both Pitt and
Rutgers. West Virginia also accomplished this ‘so
only two teams out of eight really don’t stand a chan-
ce. -

A win by Massachusetts would be an outright
miracle and while Penn State could pull a first-round
upset, it can only hope to bore its opponents to
death. 2

Although it’s not official yet, reserve quarterback
Lindsay Delaney will most likely leave Pitt to play
football elsewhere. .

l Delaney, a sophomore from Upper St. Clair, saw
limited action behind Rick Trocano this past season

and has said: “I have no idea where I’d go but I’

pretty positive I won’t be back next year.” -

Lewis is another Pennsylvania recruit. At 6-foot-1
and 180-pounds, Lewis has played running and
defensive ‘back and has 9.9 speed in the 100-yard

Pitt News Staff Writer «

A combination of victories in
both relays allowed Pitt’s women's
swim team (10-1) to defeat
Cincinnati, 74-56, last weekend and
establish itself as one of the early
favorites to win next month’s
Eastern Association of Intercolleg-
iate Athletics for Women (EIAW)
Championship.

The ﬁnal dual meet was one of
Pitt’s closest meets this season;

outscored by Cincinnati in many of
the individual events, the Panther-

° ettes needed the 14 points they
-collected by

taking both the
400-yard medley and 400-yard
freestyle relays to win.

The Pantherettes are idle until
Mar. 2, when they travel to West
Chester State College to compete in
the Eastern championship.

We’re looking forward to the

EAlAW’s,”i Pantherette coach
Dick Bradshaw said. ‘ “Except for
the North Carolina meet, our whole
season has been lacking in
challenges. Many of our victories
have been one-sided.”

Pitt, undefeated in its last nine

outings, has not lost since dropping
a 72-59 decision to nationally
ranked North Carolina last Decem-
ber.

Since then, the Pantherettes
have successively beaten Eastern
Michigan (102-29); Michigan State
(90-41); Ohio State (by forfeit);
Penn State (80-51); George Wash-
ington (106-20); Maryland (87-42);

Clarion (90-41); West Virginia

Sixteen Panthers, including

three divers, will compete in the

L Tracksters at Invite

By JOE BRANDT

Following a good performance at
Delaware this past weekend, the
Pitt track squad is in action today
as they compete in the University’
of Michigan Wolverine Invitation-
211.

Last weekend in Delaware, Pitt
dominated the jumping events with
Larry Kinney winning the triple
jump and Tim Blackshear taking
ﬁrst in the long jump. Don Maydak
was third in the long jump.

The two-mile relay of Greg
Conover, Joel Albers, Gary Siriano,

and Darren Geary placed second 2

behind Penn State but fell short in
its bid to qualify for nationals. The
mile relay of Bud Cooper, Mike
Taylor, Dwayne Defore and Keith
Leckenby was in second place when
it was disqualified for dropping the
baton.

Although disappointed because
the relay failed to qualify, coach
Mike Agostinella was pleased with
the overall performance of - the
team.

This weekend, Agostinella plans
to use his runners individually,

A few students think it’s‘O.K. to
break the rules by stealing their

ing the system they're taking
advantage of all ot us, because it
drives up the cost of providing

It's just not worth it!

improving some of their personal
records.

Competition will be tough,
however, with Pitt going against 20
other teams, including Big Ten
power Michigan. .

After the Michigan meet, the
Panthers have one more meet
before ending their indoor season
at the NCAA indoor championships
on Mar. 9 and 10.

Pitt’s outdoor track season will
‘begin the weekend of Mar. 30 at
the University of Virginia Invita-
tional at Charlottesville.

“I really thought that with the
individual wins we had, we could
have won,” West‘Virginia_ head
coach Craig Turbill said. “But
overall, we wrestled well consider-
ing our fl-day layo .”

Both teams are off until i the
Eastern Wrestling League Tourna-

West Virginia could give us a big
