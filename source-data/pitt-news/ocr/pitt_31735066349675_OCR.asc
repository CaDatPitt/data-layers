””‘scAtH Input Nixed
For SG Rally Today

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Student Government Board
(SGB) decided to -reject further
Student Coalition Against Tuition
Hikes (SCATH) input into today's
anti-tuition hike rally following a

planning meeting Monday night.
The rally, initiated by the SGB

/‘r-.._..iseveral weeks ago, had received

informal SCATH support and
several SCATH members partici-
pated in the planning of the rally.

The SGB concluded after Mon-
day’s meeting it could'not work
with SCATH to produce the rally,
according to SGB President Barry
Weisband. ,

Representatives of SGB, SCATH
and the Interfraternity Council
attended the meeting.

“SCATH members ‘did not
perceive the_ purposes of the rally
the same way SGB did," Weisband

SCATH steering committee
members said yesterday that
although there was some conflict at
the planning meeting they were not
aware of the SGB decision until
yesterday afternoon.

“Since the SCATH-SGB split, we
have shown our willingness to work
toward our common goals by
offering to help with the rally,”
SCATH member Bill Lawson said.

SGB split from SCATH in March
because it did not feel SCATH’s

1 methods would be effective in

combatting the tuition hike.

“We now-know SGB doesn’t
want to work with other groups,” p
SCATH member Larry Chaban
said.

SCATH’s efforts toward the rally
included contacting speakers and
distributing leaﬂets to students,
according to Lawson. But, since
the SGB action Monday night,

‘ SCATH has asked its speakers to

not attend the rally.

Members of the SCATH steering
committee said petitions circulated
by SCATH earlier this term will not
be presented to the Chancellor as
part of the SGB rally. The petitions
express student opposition to a
tuition hike.

tuition hike today with’picketing‘ I

and demonstrations.

SCATH members voted unani-
mously last night to attend the rally
and to publicly display their lack of
support for the SGB’s approach.

SCATH members plan to make
their way to the podium and
present Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
a speaker at the rally, with
petitions against a tuition hike.

They also plan to distribute
leaﬂets that explain their views on

‘ the tuition hike and the SGB rally.

SCATH member Dianne Gessler
was elected to speak andto present
the petitions to Posvar.

Accordingvto SCATH member
Tom Hudyma, SGB President
Barry Weisband informed SCATH
yesterday that the SGB no longer
desired SCATH input into the rally,
after SCATH members had con-
tacted' speakers from the Union of
Graduate Employes (UGE) and the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU).

“Scath has been had,” SCATH
member Linda Nyden said. “First

ODI Attempts Oakland Plan

evening with intentions of formula-
ting a long-range statement of land
use for Oakland.

After three hours of discussion,
the 12 spokesmen, representing
business, institutional and resi-
dential factions in Oakland, return-
ed to their respective organizations
with doubts‘ that an all-encompass-
ing land use policy statement can
be formulated without ﬁrst study-
ing the speciﬁc needs of each group
competing for land.

“The problem of limited land
and conﬂicting interests on this
land that we confronted when ODI
originated ﬁve years ago is still
with us today," ODI President Lois
Devereaux said. “Before we
arrange a detailed land use plan we
must deﬁne ODl's policies.”

Although the ODI position

written statement laying the
groundwork for Oakland's future.
representatives did exchange views
on appropriate land use.

expansion.”

Philips said commercial estab-
lishments should be interspersed
throughout the residential’ area to
create heterogenous districts which
attract people with different
interests.

While the residents try to hold
their own, the institutions must
respond to community needs and
provide for them, according to Ted
Guthery. Director of Planning for
the University Health Center of
Pittsburgh.

“For example, we feel more

“Likewise, we are trying to deﬁne
our needs so the community can
respond.” ,

Pitt’s aspirations and how they
could affect the community are
explained in a 300-page document
to be released in June, according to
Jay Roling, Pitt Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs.

“The businesses are concerned
with speciﬁcs, like the relocation

of bus stops “here people block

Campus Police Seek 

New Bargaining Agent

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Pitt’s Campus Police are seeking
a new union to represent them for
upcoming contract negotiations in
June, according to union spokes-
man ofﬁcer Robert Kolesky.

The move to oust the Teamsters
Union, currently the sole bargain-
ing agent for 67 of Pitt’s 95-person
police force, follows dissatisfaction
over the Teamster efforts in the
past year, according to Kolesky.

Kolesky indicated ofﬁcers may
be seeking representation by the
International Brotherhood of Police
Ofﬁcers. “The wheels are turning
right now and we'll have a new
election before the old contract is
up,” he said.

“Right now we’re in limbo,”
Kolesky added, “because the
Teamsters refuse to represent us,
they ﬁgure they probably won’t be
around after the election. In the
meantime we’re getting harassed
by the administration."

Tom _Cherry of the University's
Legal Services division denied any
organized‘ harassment of ofﬁcers
pending an election. “There is no

"harassment that I" know if, and
.‘ thereis plenty"of protection’ under -.

In other action,
scheduled dorm meetings for
tomorrow evening to educate

resident students about the tuition
hike issue and to distribute
questionaires. ‘

“If' SCATH is going_ ‘us be"

productive we need resident’
support," Diane Gessler said-

The group also decided to drop”
efforts to become an ofﬁcial

 Council 1

BY RICH HARRY

Proposals for the development of
CAS major programs -in Polish and
Japanese were discussed at a CAS
Council meeting yesterday.

Representatives from the de-
partment of Slavic languages and
literature and the department of
East Asian languages and Litera-
ture indicated each program was
approved by their respective
departments and presented rea-
sons for their institution.

The development of a Polish
major stems from an effort by the
Slavic department to attract ‘Polish
students to a program which
de-emphasizes Russian in their
studies, according to assistant
Slavic professor Oscar Swan.

Swan indicated another goal of

the department would be to attract ,

ﬁnancial support from the sur-
rounding Polish community to help
fund the program and possible
scholarships.

‘‘In order to attract money, it’s

-that a major in Polish is offered
within the Slavik department,” he
Currently, the department
only offers a major program in
Russian.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said
he has received three letters from
people outside the University
supporting the Polish program.

Swan said he foresees courses in
general Slavic culture implemented
at the high school level. Pilot
programs in Polish culture are
presently being conducted at
Shaler High School, he said.

“As far as pragmatic considera-
tions are concerned,'there seems to
be a growing need for certiﬁed
teachers in the area,” Swan said.

“Currently this is a demand that
exceeds the supply.”

According to Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Associate Dean Elizabeth
Baranger, a program leading to a
degree in Japanese would en-
courage advanced study by stu-

dents in the discipline. .

“With the importance of Japan
in world affairs, training in this
area would satisfy needs of this
country,” Baranger, said.

According to Reid Morgan, a
graduate student in Asian Studies,
employers in business are seeking
people trained in Japanese to hire
as interpreters. He also said the
federal government claims it
wants to hire students with a
background in Japanese but
already has enough people trained
in Chinese. \_

One positive aspect of the the
proposed programs is the fact they
are not “isolated majors,” accord-
ing to Marshall. “Each program
participates in a department which
goes beyond that major and
involves itself with many. different
departments in CAS,” he said.

CAREER GR_ADS FACE _
LICENSING DELAY ‘

HARRISBURG
sands of budding pharmacists,
accountants, beauticians and bar-
bers won't be able to start their
new careers right away because of
budget cuts in the State Depart-
ment, an ofﬁcial said yesterday.

Their careers will be delayed at
least three months, said Edward
Robinson, commissioner of profes-
sional and occupational affairs.

The reason: no money left to pay
licensing board members to admin-
ister examinations.

“Thousands of people who spent
years preparing for various occupa-
tions and who. invested money
won’t be able to practice or get
accredited,” Robinson said in a
telephone interview.

FORD VETOES DAY CARE BILL

WASHINGTON (AP)—Pres-
ident Ford vetoed a bill yesterday
that would grant states $125 million
to meet new federal standards for
stafﬁng day care centers.

Ford urged Congress to pass,
instead, an administration program
under which states would establish
and enforce their own day care
stafﬁng standards and set up the

ifﬁgsocial service programs they think

' best. V

In a veto message to Congress
Ford said the measure “would
perpetuate rigid federal child day
care standards for all the states and
localities in the nation, with the
cost to be paid by the federal
taxpayerf’

Ford said the bill would deny the
states flexiblity in setting stan-
dards and would make day care
more costly to the American
taxpayer.

Fire detectors failed to work, and
an alarm on the first floor, where
Jody Smith, 20, of Harrisburg, Pa.,

ORDINARY DEATH

2 HOUSTON (AP)—Doctors dis-
covered that Howard Hughes had
died “an ordinary death” due to
kidney failure, while government
agents checked fingerprints to

The Internal Revenue Service-
also said that if Hughes left his
fortune to medical research, which
his lawyer says he may have done,
it will escape taxes. Otherwise, the
maximum estate tax of 77 per cent.
could apply against much of
Hughes’ money, estimated be-
tween $1.5 billion and $2 billion.

Dorm Space Availabxle
  After Contract Returns

BY JANET HUNT

The more than 200 students on
the University housing waiting list
will know how many rooms are
available after the housing con-

tracts from_ returning students are _

reviewed, according to Housing
Director Donovan Hughes.

Hughes said the housing con-
tracts are due this Friday and
shortly after this time he will know
what to tell students on the waiting
list. .

Hughes did not know how many
extra rooms would be available.

Provisions for students on the
waiting list depends on when the
students turn in the applications
and where the student is on the list,
according to Hughes.

“Fourteen hundred beds have
been set aside for freshmen,”
Hughes explained “Most likely, all
rooms will be ﬁlled.”

The admissions office has
assured Hughes that 1,400 beds
would be sufﬁcient to house

freshmen. L
“Any increase of 50 or more
freshmen will be confronted when

_ I

that times comes,” Hughes said. i

Resident Student
Chairman Marty Doerﬂer perceives 2

some problems for students onfthe .

“Unless the University acquires

Webster Hall, which is very
doubtful because they are remodel-
ing and entire sections will be
closed, students will have to

   
  
 

consider other alternatives,” Doer- 

fler said.
The University is preparing to
make a bid for the Forbes Pavillion,
which. is owned by the federal
government, Hughes said. ‘He also
said the renovation of Bruce Hall
fordorm space will begin when the
new Law School Quadrangle opens‘
sometime in 1977. , .
Hughes said the Pavillion could_.
be converted into dorm space but it
is unknown whether.the cost of
purchase or renovations is feasible.»

»A (SGB) and the Student Coalition ‘Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH), we

hope today’s rally on the Student Union lawn ‘is well-attended.

As a way of educating students to the near-inevitability of an
increase in tuition and as a way to exhibit students_ displeasure, the
rally is a ﬁne idea. But, obviously, it will fail on both counts if no one

1 shows up. With the added attractions of spring weather and music, we

‘ h hope the rally will seem worth the trouble of attending.

As for the newest tiff between SGB and SCATH, the obvious
question to ask is why don’t they just get on with their work and leave
each other alone. Ifthey can't ﬁnd sonle way to cooperate and avoid the
ideological confrontations that have taken up so much of their time up
to now, they should just back oﬁ and work separately.

But that is a suggestion only for this year—a suggestion made
necessary by the minimal time remaining before the term ends.

For next year, when the whole tuition issue could quite possibly come

 up again, something better has to be worked out.
Student Government and SCATH members, at least those who are
_ still speaking to each other, should sit down as soon as possible to work

out sonle way of avoiding similar confrontations next year.’
The idea of a coalition, as opposed to SGB standing alone, is  the
best one. Because of a lack of interest and cooperation, it didn’t work

  A Matter of Time

BY BILL KALMAN

The Science Institute of America

reported last night that a violent

ionic storm over Western Pennsyl-
vania disrupted the space-time
continuum. According to a spokes-
person for the Institute, “The
storm ripped several small holes in
the fabric of time. Most of the area
experienced no serious effects from
the temporal disturbance. How-
ever, the University of Pittsburgh,
located in the center of the storm,
was hit very hard."

Scientists on the scene report
that Pitt was yanked from the
present and thrust two decades or
so into the past. While the rest of
the nation exists in the 1970s, it

appears that Pitt exists in the

1950s.

Several'temporal engineers from
the Institute arrived at Pitt this
morning, via a “time bridge." To
determine the effects of the time
displacement, they immediately
tested the atmosphere.

[Pete Smith, one of the scientists
working at the site reported. “First
we test the political atmosphere.
The air was denser, making it
harder to breathe. You really felt
closed in.”

The scientists also collected
samples of University life. “The
samples definitely prove our
hypothesis,” Smith said. “They

' " show that Pitt is living in the ﬁfties.

You almost expect to see Dwight
Eisenhower walking around cam-

I. pus.” .

Smith listed some examples that
proved that Pitt is'20 years behind.‘

“We. you have a movement on.»

l V b‘ '_t,-C-?'Tth.¥.1:-_Tl3,k§t;l{19-&’£?£IA.¢l1t..has b}J.ilt.a... .»Iones-concluded-» - - u - - um --N».--W

shrine to the last witch-hunter on
top of the Cathedral of Learning,
and is seeking to rewrite his
glorious deeds in American history.

“Then, you have several pro-

fessors being ﬁred for political
reasons. The best sample lfound of
this species was Paul Nyden, a
sociology prof who was dumped
for his “Communist leanings.”
Evidently, the Board of Trustees
didn’t like his politics. But he was
one of several faculty members
who were left of center. and ﬁred
because of it. ' "

“But two hours ago we found the
clincher: traces of red-baiting the
soil. Red-baiting. you'll remember,
was used in the ﬁfties against
movements of dissent or protest.
But as more and more people
joined these movement, red-bait-
ing grew scarcer and scarcer."

Smith said a student group to
ﬁght tuition hikes, SCATH, has
been continuously red-baited by
the student government, the
student paper, and various frater-
nities (fraternities, of course, were
all the rage in the 1950s). Scientists
say SCATH, a product of the
seventies. could not live lon-g in the
poisonous atmosphere of the
ﬁfties.

Stun Jones. director of special
projects at the Institute, said,
“We're trying to bring Pitt, back
into the present. But the Board of
Trustees. the administration, and
their student friends make this
extremely difﬁcult at the present
time...uh. no pun intended."

Jones suggested that a revital-
ized student movement. which
brought hundreds of colleges out of
the ﬁﬁtesxcould ne doubt do it

. again._‘.‘l_t’s only a matter- of time."

The Sad State of Kites  

 
  

BY JOHN METCALFE .5;
Just lately, I was contemplating the sad state of '//t’‘-/ y,,/:’¢/ 

kites these days. I have learned that many readers  y _.t,;-'//}/}'/'

have never heard of a kite made of anything but  ,,_'

plastic, and slippery synthetic string was the only &‘/L

kind they had ever tried to knot. I hope at least one 9,

such faithful reader will write in the solution to the
puzzle of the plastic kite with Mickey Mouse’s face
on it.

The weather ﬁnally improved. After weeks of
mourning the existence of a kite that was not at that
moment ﬂying, my son Jack and I took his kite,
Mickey Mouse and all, to a favorable hill. Our hill is
unusually favorable; it is in Highland Park, about
three blocks from our house, and overlooks the zoo
and Allegheny River. The wind blows all the time.

It might as well save its breath. I have worked in
surgical research. I am a determined, if not
productive, ﬁsherman. I have learned to make knots.
with almost any substance, knots that stay tied.

COLUMN AND A HALF

‘ 1 must be assembled. The sticks (still wooden) must

‘ “SUGARLESS BUBBLE GUM

In ‘surgery, the patient is lost if the knot comes
untied; when ﬁshing, one loses the reward for all his
patience if one knots carelessly. I knot well and
tightly. Except on that ldamnable kite.

Kites continue traditional in one respect: they still

be aligned at right angles, and lines must be
attached. One goes across the short arm of the kite
and bows it into a proper kite-shape. Another
straddles the crossarm—it is the “bridle”
string—-and. serves as the thing to. which the
ﬂying-string is attached. The assembly of the kite is
complicated enough to pass for a midterm
examination in some odd branch of engineering. If
you ’ have- a 3-year-old assistant,‘ it is simply g
impossible. 

After the- knots had come untied, the kite had,
crashed from its ultimate altitude of about six feet,
after I had taken Jack and the kite home, put Jack
into bed and the kite into that special limbo of jobs I
will. finish someday, I thought about all this.

I envy a few people.I have known, -people who have
managed to become parents at the age of 17 or so. .
Theyhave problems at which-I can hardly_ guess, but _
at-'-least they are familiar ‘with thelittle things which --
loom so large in the lives of small children. They are
probably not troubled at all by plastic kites. They

‘may neverhave used string that would take and hold
,a knot. They are blessed. They are able to spend the

last years of their childhoods in the company of their
own children. ‘

These people may understand kites. I wonder if ’
there is anyone who understands bubblegum. I have ~ ' '  4
used bubblegum. . Most often, it was Bazooka '
bubblegum. The Fleer’s folks did not put as much
gum into a penny’»s-worth as Bazooka did. Fleer’s
had better comics, but I would endure lame jokes and
poor drawings to get more gum from Bazooka. Even
their premiums were dumb (only 3,750 wrappers, or
two wrappers and $11). But I chewed it.

Now Jack has heard of gum. He must have some.
He always swallows the fraction of it that is not just
sugar and flavoring. He chews Bazooka, too.
Because we are enlightened, he chews sugarless
Bazooka. It_costs .15 for about half an ounce. There
are no cartoons; not even dumb ones.

Bubblegum is serious business now. At ﬁve
dollars a pound, it should be. I will quote for you the
legend on a pack of Bazooka gum:

Tannocho

Dean Rosenberg:
In February 1976, by a vote of
18-3, thetenured faculty of the
English Department of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh moved to
strongly recommend tenure for
assistant professor Dan J. Tanna-
city. We, the undersigned graduate
students, support the department’s
action. In strongly recommending
tenure for professor Tannacito, we
f'x_§iieve the tenured faculty acted in
me interests of graduate and
undergraduate students alike. In
support of professor Tannacito, we
would like to explain how we see
this question of tenure as related to
his considerable contribution to the
teaching and learning of "both
graduate and undergraduate stu-

‘ ‘dents.

We commend the faculty for
taking a strong position on the
values of teaching and the
development of programs within
the University. To argue in support
of professor Tannacito’s achieve-
ments-inrthese areas isto argue
more than that he himself is an

' ellent teacher. He has taught a
broad range of courses at both the
undergraduate and graduate le-
vels, has signiﬁcantly V contributed

to interdisciplinary programs, such '

as alternative curriculum and
and has
promoted the development of
cooperative teaching in all of these
endeavors.
teaching in these areasrcan be
amply. documented by student
testimony; his expertise is . evi-
denced in his frequently being
chosen by ‘ graduate students to
administer doctoral exams in the

’.4r;..._,.:as of criticism, pedagogy, and

19th century literature, and, as an

assistant professor, he has directed V

two dissertations.

Professor’ Tannacito has, most
signiﬁcantly, provided the grad-
ua_te students of this department"
with expertise in pedagogy; that is,
he has in his courses and in his
direction of graduate teachers
provided us with expert knowledge

His dedication to-

faculty and graduate students of.

the English department have

, worked together conscientiously for

several years to create a program of
teacher training which is both
outstanding and unique. To deny
tenure to someone who has
contributed so much to the
establishment of this program and
its ongoing function is to devalue
the efforts of faculty and graduate
students in this department, as
well as to show disdain for the
quality of undergraduate educa-
tion.

In consideration of the experi-

ence and judgment of both the

faculty’ and graduate students of
the English department we request
that the dean re-open this case and
seriously reconsider tenure .for
professor Tannacito.

Fundamental
Issues Ignored

A number. of faculty tenure
“problem cases” have taken up a
good deal of your news and
advertising space in recent weeks."
I suggest it is a terrible shame that

none of the major parties involved -

in these cases has yet chosen to
face the fundamental issues. I

The entire system (here and
elsewhere) ‘for handling. appoint-
ments,_ promotion’, and tenure grew
up during‘ along period when all of
us assumed that universities would

continue “to ‘grow, and expand .

‘forever.’ Any new PhD had a
number of jobs .. from which to
choose, and -everybody assumed
that almost everybody appointed to
c. a faculty poisition. would, after the
appropriate’ period, "be‘ granted
«tenure. In cases where tenure was
denied, there-"was‘ always room at
some other university or college.
In this type of world, everybody
was needed. Now all of that has
changed and quite suddenly.
University populations are leveling
off or decreasing, projections for

further growth are not optimistic, w

any new -PhD faces _stiff competi-
tion for any job he seeks, and

    

university faculties are to be
anything but totally frozen groups.
Given this context, all the major
parties to tenure disputes have
reason to avoid the real problems:
1. The tenured faculty sees no
reason to admit that tenure was
easy to come by in the past. Since
everybody was needed and re-
placements were almost impossible
to ﬁnd, the denial of tenure created
more problems than it solved.
Today’s tenured faculty does not
like to recognize that if today’s
situation had existed a few years
ago,.many of them could not have
attained tenure. Almost without
realizing it, they have taken to
wildly unjust criticism and evalua-
tion of younger faculty members,
arguing that these colleagues are
essentially “less qualified” than
their predecessors. After all, for a
tenured faculty member to admit
(in a time of steady-state enroll-
ment) that a younger faculty
member is more qualiﬁed would be
to admit that he (the tenured

member)“ should give way to that.

more qualiﬁed youngster. Because
nobody can be expected to do this,
the tenured faculty retreats to

imaligning younger colleagues.

2. Administrators ﬁnd them-
selves compelled to make tough
budgetary decisions and insist that
nonbudgetary reasons underlie the
decisions. Administrators, ‘ by
deﬁnition, are incompetent to make

decisions on such matters, but this ‘

was. not a problem when growth
was continuous (they could always
pretend they knew what they were
doing). If they were to admit now

. that budget conditions were para-
mount, theywouldahave to admit-

that past "decisions were made on

the same basis, thus emphasizing '

their l'on.g-term incompetence. As

.a- result, they’ join the ‘tenured

faculty.’s unwarranted maligningof
junior faculty. ' ~

,, 3. The junior faculty, under-
standing better than the other
groups that a negative decision on
tenure is likely to make them

— unemployable for life, nevertheless

go to great lengths to deny that
“competence” (whatever it means)
is not now and never has been
signiﬁcant.

 
 
  
  

  “ 1

' seek ‘recognition for their “accom-.
plishment,” not just continuation-
in a job because nobody else is
readily available. Not wanting to

‘desert "the “competence”
approach, they fall into some of the
oldest traps lying around. It is very
doubtful that young faculty mem-
bers are denied tenure because of
their “political views," their
“progressiveness," or anything
else of that sort. Nontenured
faculty are denied tenure because,
given the contemporary system of
organizing and operating univer-

sity facilities and budgets, they are

the handiest victims around. Only a

moment's reﬂection should make

this clear to any observer. Almost
-by deﬁnition, the only individuals
competent to evaluate the contri-

bution of any faculty member are
not to be found in his university. If
there is such a thing as a competent
peer group, it consists of people

‘who work in that area all around

the world. What goes on within .

any university (under the heading
of “evaluation”) is bound to be
irrelevant.

I suggest there are solutions to
these problems, but they are not
achievable within the “normal”
methods (union or non-union) of
university governance. But there is
little point in advancing proposed
solutions when none of the actors
(tenured faculty, administrators,
nontenured faculty and, yes,
students) seems ready to face the
problems and recognize them for
what they are. Regretfully, I
conclude we must look forward to
some period of meaningless de-
bate, ill-conceived “prot_est_ meet-

. ings,” and self-serving. admini-A.

strative “pronouncements.”
Hopefully,. I add. that the total
transformation of universities ..(and
society) is inevitable. .

7 I am an alumnus of Pitt. I

 Tattended this Universityfor four
. years, majored in sociology, and

‘completed 33 credits in that
I graduated summa
cum laude in April 1975, the only

ment to receive that honor.

_ After that bit of back-patting, I
would like to state that I am a
member of the group formed to

 defend Dr. Paul Nyden _after a

departmental review committee
and the steering committee recom-
mended that Dr. Nyden’s contract
not be renewed. I want to take this
I opportunity to set straight some
inaccuracies that have been circula-
ted about this case.
After students met with Dr.
Holzner, the chairman of the

. sociology department, on Friday

March 12', and held a sit-in in his
office on Tuesday March 16, he was
forced to recommend to his
colleagues that an open hearing be
held previous to the closed faculty
meeting on Friday, March 19.. Be
assured that he did not grant our
request out of any beneﬁcience on
‘his part. Without the meeting and
the sit-in there would not have
been an open hearing. The hearing

‘I gave students, scholars and others

 ’f‘iit‘ter or ll:le“"EdI‘l(§I“

a chance to speak on professor
Nyden’s behalf in the presence of
the tenured professors who_after-
wards would vote on the steering
committee’s recommendation.

We were told that such an open
hearing was unprecedented. I
believe that students have a right
to participate in the decision-
making process here at the
University, and, at that time I felt
that such open hearings were an
important development that should
be incorporated into University
procedure. Nevertheless, the
results of the closed faculty
meeting have convinced me that
the hearing we fought so hard to
have was just a showcase designed
to appease us and that our
testimony was totally ignored.

Unfortunately, Dr. Holzner
chose not to release the now
infamous 15-page report that
contains all the allegations and
criticisms against professor Nyden
and which is the basis for the
decision not to rehire “him.
Professor Nyden has been placed in
an unfair and impossible position of
trying to defend ‘himself without
knowing the charges against him.
The students could not prepare an
adequate defense for the hearing.

ner chose to call a “hearing” did
not conform to the democratic and
ethical guidelines that deﬁne
hearings. Dr. Holzner imposed his
arbitrary order of speakers on us. .
He imposed an artiﬁcial time limit
of one and three-fourths hours on
the hearing although many people
had come to speak. He cautioned
the tenured professors not to
question our speakers nor to
present any counter-evidence, in
spite of the fact that we welcomed
any debate‘ and - wanted the
accusations against professor Ny-
den made public.

I believe that although the
hearing was instituted to provide
student input, there is evidence
that an attempt was made to
discourage students from attending
and participating.’ Although the
time of the hearing was announced
in advance, the location was not
made public until an hour before it
was scheduled to take place. Many
students did not know where Thaw
Hall was located. Could not a more
familiar, central location been
chosen and announced in advance?

 

Some students were denied
entrance to the hearing room
ostensibly because the ﬁre mar-
shall had limited the safe capacity
to 125. Yet late-coming professors
and representatives of the media
were ' allowed to enter and
plainclothes police circulated in
and out of the room at will.

When we raised objections, Dr.
Holzner shouted that it was his
hearing. His arrogance seemed
calculated to cause a confrontation.

Certainly the presence of so
many plainclothes police raises
some questions about their intenti-
ons. A confrontation would have
discredited us and allowed the
tenured professors to walk away
without even listening to our
testimony. Dr. Holzner did not get
his confrontation.

But I must take serious issu:
with your coverage of the hearing.
Professor Lazarsfeld chaired Paul
Nyden’s thesis committee at
Columbia. On_ Monday March 15,
Lazarsfeld authored a letter that
was circulated among the faculty
and graduate students in the
sociology department. In that
letter, he lamented the fact that he
had suffered the misfortune of
chairing that thesis committee and
stated that a relatively long period
of time was spent discusing the
acceptability of the dissertation.
He criticized it as containing “little
sociological analysis.” I

Because of thesequence of your

that hearing room.
Cloward, another member of the
dissertation committee, testiﬁed
that the dissertation was accepted
very quickly and that the bulk of
the thesis committee’s meeting
was spent discussing ways to alter
the form of the dissertation so that
it could be published. Cloward’s
testimony was supported by a letter
from Herbert Gans, a
member of the thesis committee.
Cloward also mentioned that the
dissertation was praised profusely.
awarded “with distinction,” ti ‘
highest honor bestowed on a thesis
at Columbia, nominated for the
annual Bancroft Award, and in an
unprecendented move for that
department, passed without oral
defense. _
When Cloward was asked if the
dissertation was in fact a work of ,
journalism rather than sociology,
he replied that if that were so, the
dissertation would not have been
accepted. He stated that Nyden
had employed participant observa-

tion. interviews and ﬁeld work, all
valid toolsof the sociologist.

that the

\.

Cloward believed

subject of the thesis was reallygi

the heart of the dispute. Paul
Nyden wrote about the struggle of
rank and ﬁle coal miners to
establish a‘ strong, democratic
union.

He did not mention that by
casting doubts on the worth of
Nyden’s dissertation, this depart-
ment was also attacking Columbia
University which accepted and
honored it.

Towards the end of the hearing
Lazarsfeld mumbled that he wasin
‘fcomplete _ agreement” with the

.testimony of , Cloward and Ga  _
except on the matter of the lengt A

of time it took to pass the thesis.
This raises serious questions about
his honesty and/or memory.

I am urging all students to
carefully consider these issues and

' refrain from taking classes from the

following professors; all of whom
voted against professor Nyden:

Robert Avery, Rainer Baum,
Patrick Doreian, Thomas Fararo,
Burkart Holzner, Jerome Laulicht,
Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernhardt Lieber-
man, John Markoff, John Marx,
Omar Moore, Jiri Nehnevajsa,

Roland Robertson, Gilbert Shap‘3.,,-

and Vijai Singh.

By" voting 14-1-1 to accept the
steering committee’s recommenda-
tion not to rehire professor Nyden,
these men have exposed their lack
of academic integrity, their con-
tempt for the -testimony of
professors Cloward, Gans and
Frances Fox Piven, all renowned in
their ﬁelds. Finally they have
shown -their total disregard for
student opinion. The faculty

-meeting that took place behind

closed doors reeked with the stench
of decay, dishonesty, and corrup-
tion.

NASA Plagued By Politics

BY DAN MULHOLLAN D

The biggest problems the
United States space program ini-
tially had to face were political, not
scientiﬁc, according to Eileen
Galloway, special consultant to the
Senate Committee on Aeronautics
and Space Sciences.

When the Soviets launched their
Sputnik in October of 1957, the
United States faced several politi-
cal and diplomatic policy options,
Galloway said. How should a
similar U.S. space agency he set
up? Should it be part Of the
Defense Department? Who should
pay for it? '

The fact that the original impetus

-came from national security consi-

derations led to some heated
inter-service rivalries, which did

not let up until the space program‘

was placed under civilian control
with the establishment of the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) in 1958,
Galloway said.

So before scientists and technici-

ans could launch the first serious‘

space probes, lawyers and politici-
ans had to construct the frame-
work.

I /

Galloway, a political scientist by
trade, spoke of the political and
legal repercussions of the space
program in a seminar held Monday
afternoon.

She also spoke of the beneﬁts the
country has realized from the space
program, but dwelt on one she said
is often overlooked: increased
international cooperation.

NASA deemed it necessary from
the start, in that a global tracking
network, especially for manned
ﬂights, was imperative, Galloway
said. One example of nations
exchanging information via satel-
lite is the Intelsat communications
network, which now- links 91
countries. Galloway said space
exploration has done more to foster
international cooperation than any
other factor/.

The United Nations is especially
active in promoting such coopera-
ting, said Galloway, who has
served on several U.N. commit-

tees, among them, the Committee
for the Peaceful Use of Outer
Space.

Since then, treaties have been
ratified to provide for cooperation
in the rescue of stranded astro-
nauts and to determine liability in
the event of space accidents.
Treaties requiring the registration
of space vehicles and one dealing
with the peaceful use of the moon
are pending, she said.

The moon treaty may come
under attack from. third_ world
nations, led by India, who may
demand that any resources taken
from the moon by the major powers
be shared with /the less-developed
nations.

An upcoming conference, in
Geneva, where Galloway will be
part of the U.S. delegation, will
discuss the moon treaty, as well as
the legal definition of outer space.

New Blues ‘King’ Emerging

BY GEORGE FAINES

Larger Than Life, Freddie King,
RSO Records S0 4811

You've all heard of B.B. King,
and some of you are familiar with
Albert King, but who the hell is
Freddie King? Well, after
listening to Freddie King's new
release, Larger Than Life, you will
know who he is.

Larger Than Life is comprised of
original numbers, blues standards
and live cuts, with the latter being
the most moving. The studio tracks

ﬂmove along fairly well, especially
” “It’s Your Move," which features

some’ nice horn arrangements.
is a

   

disco number that has Top 40
potential.

It's the live numbers, however, A

that provide the added punch to the
album. Recorded at a concert in
Austin, Texas these tracks are so
full of raw power and excitement
that they make you wish the whole
album was recorded in concert.

King’s version of Dylan's “Meet
Me In The Morning” features a
frantic sax solo by David “Fat-
head" Newman, not to mention
King's moaning guitar.

.“The Things I Used To Do”
slows things down and lets King
sing the blues in his raspy voice.
After a couple of verses, King's
voice yields to his guitar and the

solo that follows is straight from his
soul.

“Ain’t That I Don't Love You” is
an uptempo number and one of the
best tracks on the album. King
puts all he has into this one and it
really cooks. King also does a nice
version of “Wake Up This
Morning," but the highlight of the

album is the classic, “Have You

Ever Loved A Woman." The blues
always have contained shady
sexual references and this track is
no exception. '

The words are an‘ emotional
release and are not to be taken
seriously. ,The music they play
however, should be—especially the

‘King sound——on this album.

President’s Men is one of the most

The plot is history now, covering
the period from the actual

on how the Watergate story was

‘ nature photo contest.

Displayed in the Student Union
Communications Room are 79
works by Pitt photographers. Open

S, to any Pitt student handy with a

camera, the contest was judged by
Post-Gazette photographer Albert

French, Walt Seng, a teacher at
Pittsburgh Film Makers, and Herb
Ferguson, a professional still-life
and ﬁlm photographer.

The ground rules were to capture
some aspect of the natural world on
ﬁlm.

The photographs are beautiful-
to a fault. The show seems to syving
too one-sidedly to the aesthetically
pleasing shots of ‘ nature. With a
few exceptions—Jeremy Nobel's

Max Marrovic does a unique
thing. though. Still following the
objectives. of the contest, he
portrays nature in the realistic
setting that we town-dwellers‘ can
appreciate. Marrovic does not
screen out the telephone lines and
parked cars that more often than
not are part of urbanites’ view of
nature in the city. He photographs
the white, hazy glow of the sun

lins andhouses lining the street.

Many works’ seem to display
natural still-lives. They fail to
convey the sense of process, of
change and of regeneration that is
fundamental to the depiction of
nature. We see the full color of an
autumn forest, or water lilies at the
peak of their freshness. But why
not nature with a tint of brown or

unfolding spring instead of the
static view of spring in full

  Dazzling Piano Duo

Enthralls Pgh. Fans 

BY TOM WASELESKI

They could’ve beenla pair of

bespectacled Liberaces—red satin-

trousers, lapels and cuffs, vibrant
red, white and blue jackets. The
only things missing were sequins.

Ferrante and Teicher, the
dynamic piano duo of movie theme
fame, brought their showmanship
to Heinz Hall this weekend as part
of this season’s Pops series
saluting some of the country’s
greatest musicians.

A pair of Baldwin concert grands
at their ﬁngertips, they played the
gamut from Jimmy Webb to Scott
Joplin and from George M. Cohan
to Stephen Foster. Ferrante and
Teicher enthralled a full house with
their dazzling keyboard work.

There were plenty of times,
however, when the two concert
masters failed to do justice to a
tune. This was usually due to the

the audience didn’t mind, and it
was unduly generous with its ﬁnal
ovations.

Conductor Thomas Michalak and
the Pittsburgh Symphony opened
the event with classic selections by
Dvorak and Rossini-Respighi.
Turning to some lighter material,
the orchestra shone through
Strauss’ “Vienna. Blood” waltzes.
(It seems‘ you can’t go to a Pops
concert these days without ﬁnding
Strauss on the program.) Then,

ancient tree (45) has a background

' of groubled, cloudy skies that seem

to be sifting; moving through the
print before our eyes. Similarly,
Rich Wilson's snow-burdened tree
with one, dried-up old leaf still
clinging to its source alludes to the
change from previous months and
suggest the contrasting view of that
tree a few months into spring.

The sun is a repeatedly used
motif in these prints. But with their
fresh, angled perspectives and the
unusual effects attained by them,
these prints yield new imagesof

directions like a professional
dancer, the orchestra delivered a
heavily Latin rendition of a medley
from West Side Story.

Ferrante and Teicher picked up
on the Broadway theme with a few
well-chosen selections by Cohan,
no stranger to the echoing theaters
of New York. “I’m a Yankee
Doodle Dandy” and “Give My
Regards to Broadway" were the
set’s highlights. the kevbnards

lending them an unusual caﬁ;

ﬂavor.

The piano pair had less success
with Webb's “Up, Up, and Away,”
which they tainted with too much
jazz, detracting from its broad,
soaring melody. They added
nothing new to “By the Time I Get
to Phoenix,” sounding like ‘any
other Muzak version, and they

performed melodic overkill on-

“MacArthur Park’s” central motif.

"President's Men" Hit

/Cu/1!in11e11fI'u//I Pa;/e I0)

enced reporters dig up a hot story,
with some pretty scandalous
repercussions, when no other
paper ‘or news service would touch
it.

The many virtues of All The
President’s Men outweigh its few
faults, the most grievous of which
is the ending. Dramatically, the
ending is quite poor, leaving the
two heroes on rather dangerous
ground. The previous knowledge
that they're alive and well and
collecting juicy royalty checks does
alleviate the suspense, but future
audiences may not know the good
news.

Also, the fact that “Deep
Throat’s” identity (played here by
Hal Holbrook) had to be kept secret
meant that the best part of a
newspaper-detective story had to

be left out—referring to just how
those “secret sources” are found
and cultivated. A bit more detail on
the time factor could also have
been included to help the under-
standing of non-Watergate-follow
ers.

Primarily a plot-oriented story,
President's Men dwelt too little—
of necessity—on the curious
relationship that grew between
Woodward and Bernstein. Hoff-
man does very well as the latter,
pretty well fitting the image of a
hungrv. voung chain-smoking re-
porter who will “do anything” for a
story. Redford, as Woodward,
doesn't work as well. Even when
his suit is carefully wrinkled and he
cradles a phone while taking notes,
he still seems to have gotten the job
because he knows the producer.

bright light shows off the pristine
freshness of greenery. Her concern
is pattern as the spot-lit leaves
throw smaller duplications of their
serrated shape on each other.

A few of these prints were part of
the recent UP Gallery Exhibition.
They are worth a second look. Rick
Devlin's satiny night scene (9),
depicting the full moon above
mountain peaks, is wondrously
beautiful. And without the not-so-
pretty, but damn good shots of
decaying forests by a fore-mention-
ed photographers Nobel and
Martin, the show would have been

too “nice.”

Three awards were given by the
jurors. The first prize went. to
William Koza (74). Gary Schweit-

zer took second with his branch
sun/leaf composition-(75), and
Dennis Spyra placed third with his
ultrared sunset.

Wilson, Devlin and John Singer,
the coordinators of the show,
submitted their works for screening

but did not count themselves

eligible for the $50, $25 and $15
awards.

The exhibit is contained in a
glassed display case, which inhibits
easy visibility of some works. The
placing of the display is also
unfortunate—viewers are often
bumped by passersby. But with the
lack of space.in the Union and the

need to protect the prints, the
unfortunate setting is understand-
able.

April 17, in which top fencers from
New York, Washington D.C., West
Virginia, New Jersey, Philadel-
phia, Penn State, Virginia, Ohio,
Montreal and Saurer’s own private
Pittsburgh club will compete.

But Saurer and the Pitt Fencing
Club, despite their performances,
go unnoticed, basically because“
fencing is obscure compared to
football, basketball, and baseball.
As a matter of fact, the club gets no

It is reminiscent of that
mid-September “sneak.” They’re
about to unveil the newest
automobiles, the ones you’ve
heard about through the grapevine,
and read about for months in all the
magazines.

On Saturday at 1 p.m. anyone
interested enough to pay two bucks
can be treated to a sneak preview of
the 1976 Pitt football team. The
ones you’ve been looking forward
to since their December 26th Sun
Bowl victory.

It’s a team that returns 18 of last
year's 22 starters. It’s a team that
has ﬁgured prominently in_every-
one’s pre-season top ten. It’s a
team loaded with talent, speed,
experience, and scads of possible
all-Americans.

It’s a team that, despite its

“potential powerhouse” status,

has yet to enthrall it’s own head

coach,Johnny Majors.

“We’ve been up and down all

spring’ practice isn’t the most
exciting time of the year and it
takes a little extra effort.”

Indeed, it would be difficult for
the team that has become the
miracle of Oakland in just three
years to do more_ than just go
through the motions, so Majors and
his staff have gone back to the
basics; the fundamentals.

An attempt to instill the emotion
and enthusiasm of the upcoming

Majors’ chief concern. “We had

The Panther offense, which

rebounds?” asks the public address announcer as 200 college coaches _ Vi

greedily wrote down names and numbers of the top high school
basketball players in the nation.
“Michael Rice has become the ﬁrst United States All-Star to sign a

letter-of-intent for the University of Pittsburgh,” continues the, 
announcer. Strike him, the coaches say to themselves as ‘each draws a t V

bold line through Rice’s name on the program. , .
_ Such is the scene at the “All-Star Auction,” better known as t_he_

Dapper Dan Roundball Classic, where 44 of" the top ..pl;;yers5in_ }
Pennsylvania, New York and throughout the United States gathered

Friday to show their worth to coaches ready to bid the world, if ’
necessary. to grab one for their program. ~ - ‘

. Scores of crafty, coaches attacked these unsuspecting high school:
seniors before, during and after the game. Many coaches blocked the 7
_ exits,‘eliminating' any way fora player to evade them, and were ‘loaded 
with brochures describing the basketball program (not the school's) j ‘
“academics, mind you) they thrust at the athletes) along with their

convincing sales pitches. -

It was dog-biting-dog as the coaches, players and press headed to a,..;; 
reception at the Sheridan Inn in Monroeville. While leaving the Arena, »' 
Pitt Coach Tim Grgurich was heard to say of Sonny Lewis, who the. 5

Panthers have all but officially signed, “We're going to have to keep

an eye on him out there. They’re all going to be after him. We can't 

lose him.’ ’

By pouring in 20 points for the Pennsylvania All-Stars and being 

named one of the big game’s most valuable players, Lewis stepped to

the head of the auction block. Others, like B.B. Flenory (21 points), Jay I

Shidler (MVP for the U.S.‘ All-Stars) and Mike Brooks, also became
prime products for what many consider the basketball “ﬂesh market.”

Basketball agent and Roundball organizersonny Vaccaro denies the In

accusations, though the evidence is stacked against the event. '
' The Roundball turns over $300,000 to charity each year, which is

great. But it’s appearance to be a big auction cannot be denied by 

Vaccaro or anyone.
Pitt is doing its share‘ of bidding—Jeff Baldwin from General

Braddock and Ed Scheuermann from Baldwin are two prospects Pitt is 5

interested in, according to Assistant Coach Bob Hill. “We’re really
trying to get Scheuermann. We feel he’s going to be a really great’

college player.” Also on Pitt’s list are Ron Valentine from Norfolk, 7  

Virginia, Steve McDowell from Buffallo, Dave Yonicker from Cleveland
and John Moore from Clairton. ‘ ’

Next Wednesday is “Final Bid” or national letter-of-intent day,
when the players must announce ofﬁcially their choices and agree to
attend the schools for at least one year. Hill is conﬁdent Rice, Dave ‘
Washington and Lewis are in the bag, especially Lewis. “He feels at
home with us,” Hill said. “He gave us his word, and that's good
enough.”

Whoops--Golfers Shank Line-up, Lose Match

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Like most of us, Pitt golf coach
Steve Petro is a second-guesser.

Following Friday’s tri-match
victories over Duquesne and West
Liberty, which saw Terri Rockford
and Jeff Nagel shoot 82 and 90,
respectivelv. and Rorv Dauson turn
in a 78, though not among the six in
competition, Petro decided on
several lineup changes for Mon-
day’s match with Youngstown
State.

. , First, he made Dawson a starter
i ,.'ind dropped both Rockford and.

Nagel because of their unimpres-
sive scores. So, what should
happen against Youngstown?

Dauson bombs, and Rockford and
Nagel shoot low rounds which, of
course, don’t count.

Though Pitt held the medalist
score with Bruce Stephan’s 74 on
the par 71 Green Oaks Country
Club Course, the Panthers "went
down to defeat by a 383-396 score.

If either Rockford’s or Nagel’s

score would have counted, Pitt ,

could haveupset the Penguins, an
especially ﬁne team. But Petro
feels the competition among his
players is going to help the team in
the long run.

“This is going to make us a
healthy team,” Petro said. “We’re
progressing and we will have
probably as good a team as ever.
I’m very "pleased with the team,

  

-‘accepted.

JULIE EISENHOWER FEELS
BOOK’S BACKLASH

JACKSON, Miss. (AP)—Julie
Nixon Eisenhower has canceled a
scheduled address to the Mississ-
ippi Economic Council membership
meeting tomorrow “because of the
pressure on the Nixon family as a
result of the distribution of. the
book, ‘The Final Days,’ ” the
organization said yesterday.

The state Chamber of Commerce
organization said a spokesman for
Mrs. Eisenhower and her husband,
David, said they have “been
unable to leave their apartment” in
Washington because of constant
questioning by reporters about the
book, which describes the last days
of the Nixon administration.

QUINLAN RULIN G WILL NOT BE
APPEALED

TRENTON, N.J. (AP)—Atty.
Gen. William F. Hyland said
yesterday he will not appeal a New
Jersey Supreme Court ruling
allowing Karen Anne Quinlan’s
father to order her life-support
system disconnected.

“I do not see in the decision of
the Supreme Court an obvious
immediate danger to the public
interest,” Hyland said.

The court last week appointed
Joseph Quinlan legal guardian for
his 22-year-old daughter, giving
him the right to order an end to
medical treatment which has kept
the young woman alive for nearly a
year in a deep and apparently
irreversible coma.

The court said Quinlan must
have approval from competent
medical authorities before ordering
Miss Quinlan’s respirator shut off.
And the justices said doctors,
nurses and the hospital would not
be liable for prosecution if they
complied with Quinlan’s request to
allow his daughter to die.

Hyland said the ruling has made
it important for hospitals through-
out the state to establish ethics
committees to consider the kind of
decision ordered by the court in the
Quinlan case.

“Thus, while the Quinlan case
may soon come to an end, the
debate over its merits may be just
beginning,” he said.

LBJ MEMORIAL DEDICATED

WASHINGTON (AP)—President
Ford yesterday helped dedicate a
national memorial to the late
President Lyndon B. Johnson and

ﬁtting tribute not only to the
President but to his First Lady.”

“It's entirely appropriate in this
city of stone and marble that we
should honor him with this grove of
pines,“ Ford said at a ceremony
attended by Lady Bird Johnson.
