   

onas Salk, discoverer of polio

By Brian Lehew

- For The Pitt News

Dr. Jonas Salk, developer of the polio
vaccine, challenged medical students to
rely on nature’s voice as well as research
in preparing for the technology of the
next century. He spoke to students
Friday at Scaife Hall about the future of
viral research and his work toward a vac-
cine against Human Immunodeficiency
Virus.

While researching at the University of
Pittsburgh, Salk developed the inocula-
tor vaccine for polio, which was
approved for use in the United States in
1955.

Salk stressed the need to include the
human factor in research, explaining that
the arts and sciences are co-dependent,
just as the independent systems in the
human body rely upon each other for
survival. "

Salk explained that despite vaccines,

diseases like polio will not be eradicated
as long as the virus is reintroduced into
society. “If there is a will, there’s a way.
But if there is a way, there is not always
a will,” Salk said.

He is confident, however, that polio
will one day be eradicated.

Salk’s research with HIV suggests that
it may be‘ possible to effectively protect
against HIV infection through a strategy
of low-dose immunizations.

His studies of individuals exposed to
the virus have shown that exposure at a
low level can be harmless and possibly
protective.

Thus far, all trial immunizations have
been performed after HIV infection.
Salk’s strategy proposes further research
towards a vaccine for HIV-negative indi-
viduals.

“The hypothesis has value,” he said.
“The'question is: Can we simulate [the
protectionl?” . _

Salk expressed hope that the ‘next

test new
cancer
vaccine

By Christine Hanna

Pitt researchers initiated a
gene therapy protocol that will
attempt to immunize cancer
patients against the disease.

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center announced
Thursday the beginning of this
protocol for patients with
advanced melanoma (a form of
skin cancer) or advanced breast,
colon or kidney cancer — all
deadly forms of the disease.

On Sept. 7, a 69-year-old
Western Pennsylvania man with
advanced melanoma was the
first person to undergo this
treatment.

Tumor cells and skin tissue
are taken out of the patient’s
body, then the skin tissue is
genetically altered to create
large amounts of interleukin-4
(IL-4), a protein which regulates
the growth and movement of
immune cells in the body.

The genetically-altered tissue
and the tumor cells are mixed to
form a vaccine. Then the vac-
cine is injected into the patient’s
lower back at five different loca-
tions.

After two weeks, doctors will
take tissue samples and analyze
them for anti-tumor activity.
Then five more injections will
be made into another area of
the back.

SGB strives to enhance campus atmosphere

 

By Sam'Gresock
and Matt Groff
The Pitt News

Student Government Board
President Jacob Brody
announced plans to improve
the atmosphere on the Pitt cam-
pus at the SGB’s first meeting of
the fall" term on Friday.

Brody’s projects for the fall

term include purchasing a gaze-
bo and clock for the William Pitt
Union lawn. According to
Brody, this plan will give visi-
tors and members of the Pitt
community another reason to
enjoy the campus’ physical
beauty.
‘ “Pitt is between two of the
busiest streets in Pittsburgh, so
we’re trying to create a more
relaxed atmosphere,” Brody
said. “We need some land-
marks.”

Brody said Pitt has agreed to
share the cost of the “land-
marks” but would not specify
the cost.

Additionally, Brody ‘ is work-
ing to transform the 11th ﬂoor

of Amos Hall into a recreation
area for the sororities who occu-
py the residence hall.

Brody also took time to reﬂect
on one of his successful goals
from last spring: the installation
of increased lighting throughout
the Pitt campus.

“The lights look great,”
he said. “They enhance the
beauty of the campus, as well
as operating as a safety mea-
sure.”

The new lights illuminate the
sidewalks near the Cathedral of
Learning, William Pitt Union,

Hillman Library and the Frick,

Fine Arts Building.

Brody said additional light-
ing will be installed according
to student demand this semes-
ter. A

Board member August
Imholtz said he is acting on
complaints from students who
are upset with the limited acces-
sibility of top—level administra-
tive officials.

“A lot of the students I talked
to thought the administration

should come to them,” Imholtz

.change

said.

The accessibility problem
may be solved in part through
the efforts of board member
Ted Schroeder, who has been
working to set up more open
forums with university officials
such as Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor. .

Schroeder also voiced his
wishes to see more student
involvement in the SGB.

“The only way you can
things is to get
involved,” he said. “A lot of
freshmen students do not even
know what SGB is. We could
have a good year if more stu-
dents get involved.”

Schroeder said Pitt students’
first chance to get involved
takes place today and
Wednesday at the SGB open
house in 639 WPU.

He urged students to attend
the open house, held from 12 to
3 p.m., and to consider applying
for positions on SGB commit-
tees.

He said positions are immedi-
ately available on the Academic

plans to work on possibly

major at Pitt. Munkatchy said
she is also setting up the 5K

In new business, SGB
appointed Maegon Barlow to

Committee. '
Additionally, the board

approved an allocations request
by the Black Action Society for
the transferral of programs to
Kevin Powell.

Brody also said he under-
stood both sides of the recent
controversy involving the BAS
and The Pitt News.

“Before daggers are thrown,
people need to sit down at a
common table and find solu-
tions,” Brody said. “Those
involved should try to work out
a solution before we create fear
and confusion among students.”

By Cameron Harvey

The term “feminism” has
always been a greatly misunder-
stood term. It is therefore one
of the goals of Pitt’s Campus
Women’s Organization to clarify
what the word means.

The term feminism defines, .

”anyone who cares about the.
betterment of women socially,
politically and privately,” CWO
co-President Shira Hassan said
at last Thursday’s opening meet-
ing. » V .
The philosophy behind CWO
is simply to strive toward
the achievement of equality
according to
Hassan.

Within this framework, some
of the issues, which many of the
members said they are eager
to work upon, is the creation
of small -discussion groups
for women, striving for better
campus safety, more academic
equality and the redefinition
and education of the public
as to what a “feminist” really
is. -

After a week and a half of
operation the new food court
in the William Pitt Union is still
working out the bugs.

Students have complained
about the loss of seating for
commuters, the missing yogurt
machine and the absent bak-
ery.

“It’s certainly not going to
be perfect the first day it
opens, nor will it be perfect
this week or next week,”
Marriott representative Jim
Jenkins said. “It’s a brand new
facility with all new equip-
ment.”

Jenkins attributed early

problems to the fact that the
renovation was finished in
only 65 days.

“I’m amazed we made it,” he
said.

One of the major complaints
has come from students who
commute.

The lower area of the union
had previously been an area
where commuters could eat
lunch or study.

“Now that there are a
greater number of people
coming into [the area]. The lit-
tle study area -for commuters is
practically being wiped away,”
Student Government Board

member Tara Munkatchy said.

“The people that came to me

[with complaints] were com-

muters.”

She said SGB is looking for
a possible solution.

Jenkins said the problem
was considered, and that is
one reason that the designers
went out of their way to make
sure there would be only two
fewer seats than there were
last year.

Students also complained
about the planned bakery.

“What bakery?” was the
remark from several students.

Jenkins said that the bakery
case that came in was the
wrong size and had to be sent
back. The new one will be in
next week. i‘

’ The other missing item is a

yogurt machine.

“Yogurt was never drawn in
[the plans], and we’re still try-
ing to figure out where we’re
going to put it,” Jenkins said.
“I know that people have
asked for it and we want to
get it out there. We have the
machines. It’s just a matter of
where we’re going to place
them.”

Some students have been
wondering what parts of the
food court will be open until
11 p.111. Jenkins said the

Manchu Wok will be closed.

for the late-night program. But
the Chinese takeout, along

with the grill‘ and deli, will be

available on the other side of

the court.

Pitt evaluates emergency medicine

By Mike Lyczko
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The University of Pittsburgh is
paving the way for emergency
medicine in the United States.

The federal govemment’s cur-
riculum for emergency medical
treatment standards is currently
being written and evaluated at
Pitt.

“We’re testing the program
and opening up a class this fall.
It will eventually be accepted as
the federal standard for the
emergency medical technician
[EMT] curriculum,” said Joann
Nader, director of marketing and
public relations for the Center
for Emergency Medicine.

“The Center for Emergency
Medicine is a multi-hospital con-
sortium dedicated to the
advancement of emergency
medicine. We offer classes in
areas such as cardiopulmonary
resuscitation [CPR] and ﬁrst aid
for EMTs, paramedics, physi-
cians and other health-care pro-
fessionals,” Nader said.

According to Nader, three
main ways to advance emer-

_ gency medicine are: academic

research, pre—hospital training
involving paramedics and EMT s,
and medical education and
other health education classes
for medical professionals and
the air transport program of four
helicopters and two airplanes.

“Helicopters are used because
of the time factor, because most
cases are emergencies,” Nader
said. Helicopters transport criti-
cally ill patients to tertiary care
hospitals “for a higher level of
care,” because community hos-
pitals can’t provide the same
level of service as a teaching
hospital, she said.

The STAT MedEvac air—trans-
port program for transporting
critically—ill patients is used by
many hospitals, including com-
munity hospitals in outlying
areas. Helicopters are stationed
at Mercy Hospital,
Westrnoreland Hospital, the St.
Francis Health System Center in
Cranberry Township/Butler
County and the Allegheny
County airport.

Residents assist city para-
medics by staffing a center jeep
that responds to calls in the ﬁeld
and having a training period on
a helicopter. “There is a wide
range of training [including] sev-
eral hospitals,” Nader said.

The center works with munic-
ipal officials in designing disas-
ter plans during major projects.
Large construction projects such
as the recently completed
International Airport and the
planned renovation of the Fort
Pitt tunnels require planning in
how to move ambulances
around, Nader said.

Seven hospitals are represent-
ed on the board of directors.

The hospitals are Children’s, A

By Lynn Belice
For The Pitt News

Although graduation may
seem far off for many, it’s never
too soon to start thinking about ‘
future career plans,_according to
Pitt’s Placement Center.

Advising students on how to
write a resume, prepare for an
interview and help with job
searching are all services the
Placement Center provides for
students at no cost.

“We work with people.to give
them the skills to know how to
land a job. -We help identify
strengths and weakness so that
they can be improved,” place-
ment counselor Kevin Collins

‘said. “There is something we

can do for everyone.” _
The center provides access to
employers so students can get
the feel for being interviewed
and learn how to contact

’ employers themselves, Collins

said. _

‘The counselors help students
become familiar with the impor-
tance of certain strategies so
they give a‘ good ‘impression in
their interviews, according to
Collins.

“The idea behind the center is
to take initiative to help the stu-
dents in whatever way possi-
ble,” Collins said.

Help is available year round
for students in all majors. .

Plastic waste reality in today's modern society

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

“I only have one word to

say to you. Plastics. Think >

about it.”

The advice given toDustin
.Hoff_man’s character in the
1968 film The Graduate still
holds true today. Where Mr.
McGuire’s advice concerned
only career opportunities,
thoughts today extend far
beyond.

Interest and concern has
focused on plastic waste and
what to do about it.

Plastics have been around
since before the turn of the
century and today there more
than 3,000 different types.
They are often used because
they are cheaper, stronger,
lighter and more durable than
other materials. But the dura-
bility has created problems of
its own.

Plastics are considered to be
inert. They will remain in
lanclfills_ forever. Research by
William Rathje, author of
Rubbish, has found that this
may be true of all materials in
landfills due to the sealing
process used to cover the fill.

He cites stories of finding
hotdogs intact and readable
newspapers 20 years later.

However, plastics receive
the brunt of the bad press con-
cerning non—degradation, and
face greater needs to be recy-

cled.T o help consumers iden- .

tify’ their plastic recyclables, an
industry—wide coding system
developed by the Plastic
Bottle Institute, a division of
the Society of the Plastic
Industry, has been adopted by
many states as law.

Under the coding system,
manufacturers place an alpha-
numeric identification code at
or near the bottom of each

container to identify the type
of plastic used.

The following table defines
the plastic identiﬁcation codes
and gives some examples of
uses:

1 - PETE, such as Clear 2-
liter pop bottles and salad-
dressing “bottles

2 - HDPE, such as milk bot-
tles, bleach bottles and gro-
cery bags

' 3 - PVC, such as shampoo,
cooking oil and some cosmet—.
ic bottles ’

4 - LDPE, such as dry clean-
ing bags and dairy container
lids

5 — PP, such as yogurt con-
tainers and medicine bottles

6 — PS, such as video cassette
cases, hot drink cups and dis-
posable cutlery

7 - Others, which includes

all other types of plastic

always run the risk of dirt contaminating
the material,” Hatala said.

“Numbers 4 through 7 take even
longer to get to 20,000 pounds,” she
said.

“And we are considered a-medium
sized facility.”

The Lackawanna facility recycles about
20,000 tons of plastic annually, accord-
ing to Hatala.

“The fact that materials are picked up
for recycling doesn’t mean they are
reused,” said Southwestern Pennsylvania
Energy Center project director Sara
Crumm said. Ciumm estimated that only
about 25 percent of the materials were
actually recycled, with the remainder still
going to landfill.The sorting stage of the

process is the most expensive in terms of
getting plastic into the recycling loop.

Accordingly, the need to reduce its
high cost became the driving force in
creating the array of scanning and imag-
ing technology that has brought plastics
recycling so quickly to the brink of total
automation.

The machines now being refined in
the field have the ability to sort by four
major resin types, as well as by color and
opacity.

Moreover, in test runs they preform
with 99.9 percent efficiency at speeds
that are up to 16 times faster than manu-
al sorting processes, according to Fran
Zambotti of SPEC.Major markets for
recycled plastics are in plastic lumber,
carpet, containers and strapping, as well

as packaging materials and furniture.

The plastic lumber may be used for
fence posts, picnic tables, garden edging
and parking barriers.

It lasts longer, doesn’t need to be
painted, and doesn’t contaminate the
surrounding environment like products
such as pressure—treated wood will,
according to Dave Oneacre of
Laird Plastics, a national plastics distribu-
tor.

Research is being conducted at Pitt to
find other methods of recycling, and
other uses for the recycled materials.

Eric Beckman, a professor in the’

chemical engineering department is
investigating the possibility of extracting
the coloring agents from recycled plas-
tics. “Where the value of high density

polyethylene, for example, may be 26 or
27 cents a pound, the color may be

’ worth $20 a pound,” Beckman said. “At
. these prices, you could afford to give the

resin away, making the profit on the
reclaimed colors.”

Beckman also said that burning plas-
tics to generate energy was-a viable alter-
native.

“Plastics have a_ very high btu output.
The process is there to burn waste. The
design of the incinerators is quite good,
but the problems come from poor opera-
tion and maintaince [of the incineratorsl,”
Beckman said. “Finding uses for recycled
materials, as well as designing recycling
processes, will be a dynamic industry in
the near future and should be looked at
by those in school today,” said Hatala.

[reporter] was excluded from

everything that was quoted by
The Pitt News, and I do not
sway from my beliefs;”. .

An official BAS leaﬂet distrib-
utedlat the Indaba advised The
Pitt News editor Julie Sabol to
“discontinue being -emotional
and outraged about truth-
ful statements” and to instead
focus on eliminating the
racism perpetuated by the
paper.

“Anyone who wants to write
for The Pitt News is welcome to
do so. We never turn away
writers. By printing [Eybers’l
statements in last week’s paper,

we were simply reporting the
news on campus, which is our
job,” Sabol said.

The BAS said that its commit-
ment to black unity supercedes
differences in religious or sexu-
al preference, and BAS officers
have dismissed as “lip service”
Sabol’s invitation to work with
the group to provide a more
diverse news staff. V

While interviewing students
at the BAS-sponsored Afrofest
on Sunday, Pitt News reporters
Christine Hanna and Steve
Kozarovich were approached
by campus police, who
informed the two that a harass-
ment complaint had been filed
against them.

“Everyone that I talked to was
cooperative,” Hanna said.

“When I was talking to some-
one, [BAS officers] yelled ‘Don’t
talk to them! They’ll twist your
words around.”’

During a question-and-
answer period at Friday’s
Indaba, one member
questioned the BAS administra-
tion’s practice of making
monolithic statements on behalf
of Pitt’s entire black student
body.

“We read things in the paper

chairs] said  but a lot of
us might not necessarily

said.

on this campus?” Daniel asked.

Each question was met with a
thunderous “No!” from the
audience.

“It amazes me that you can
pay your tuition and go to
classes day after day and not
own a single textbook written
by an African American,”
Daniel said.

When asked to describe his
vision of a racially just universi-
ty, Daniel answered, ”We need
to have an environment in
which people understand the
value of diversity, an environ-
ment in which you take differ-
ences and make them assets,
not liabilities. .

“All of the parts need to have
a synergistic relationship. It’s
like the beating of a heart 
two parts work together to pro-
duce a single beat,” Daniel said.

Most of Daniel’s speech
focused on what he feels are
the most urgent threats, both
internal and external, to black
cohesion.

The African-American com-
munity is in need of “massive
corrective brain surgery”
according to Daniel, who called
re-education a prerequisite for
unity.

“Unity is not attained through

colors, clothes, handshakes or

hair,” Daniel said.

He later advised the students
to avoid “the cult of the individ-
ual” and to focus on the
advancement of the comm-
unity and not of their own
interests.

“A person is measured by

how far his family has come,”
Daniel said. 9

Daniel talked extensively
about the correlation between
the control of society’snaming
process and the progress of
African Americans.

“The ‘sticks and stones’ say-
ing is a proverbial lie,” Daniel
said.

“Dogs are named by their
masters. Slaves are named by
their masters.

“Those who have the power
to name have the power to con-
trol,” Daniel said.

As long as blacks continue to

_have a limited voice in the na1n—

ing process, “black will

continue to be bad, and white ‘

will always be right,”
said.

“The eloquent prose of rap
artists will be dismissed as ‘hip-
hop,”’ and not fit for serious
review in academia, Daniel
said.

Daniel

At the same time, Daniel told

students not to be concerned
with
appellations,” but to instead
“decide on a purpose and pur-
sue it vigorously.” .-

If they are successful in tha
pursuit, they may be given
more important labels like
“freedom fighter” or “revolu-
tionary,” Daniel said.

“One determined student can
accomplish more than 2,000
with Xs on their caps and
Malcolm on their minds,”
Daniel said.

Daniel advised the BAS to
focus on an objective that could

round of injections, investigators will physically examine the
patients and perform radiographic studies to see if the tumors have

responded to the therapy.

Dr. Michael Lotze, co-director of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute’s
Biological Therapeutics Program, said that this protocol may not be
the “magic bullet” to cure cancer, but right now he knows of no
better ideas or approaches than this particular one.

“Our ultimate goal in this research is to see» tumors shrink or pos-'

sibly disappear altogether in many of the patients receiving this
kind of therapy,” said Dr. Joshua T. Rubin, assistant professor of
surgery at UPMC‘and co-principal chairperson of this study.
“Because this is a preliminary, or phase one trial, a major aspect of
this protocol is defining the ‘best dose of genetical1y—altered cells to
giv'e_patients'.” The protocol has been tested successfully on mice,
and positive results have been seen as soon. as two weeks after ini-
tial testing, Lotze said. According to Lotze, the treatment will only
be given as a last resort to cancer patients who have had other

treatments that were ineffective.

the organization, and he sub-
mitted his own idea about what
that objective should be.

“I dare you to try to rename
something on this campus for
yourselves,” Daniel said.

As an example, Daniel said a
unified BAS could muster
enough “revolutionary poten-
tial” to re-dub the Litchfield
Towers in honor of Harriet
Tubman.

Daniel saw complacency
among young African
Americans as a major obstacle
to unity and liberation.

“It’s like they’ve had too
much [black entertainment tele-
vision] and all that.” Daniel
said.

“They don’t know a thing
about civil rights. They don’t
know about taking over any-
thing.

“They think they’re free, but
they don’t know about the
struggle,” Daniel said.

Daniel, described as a faculty
mentor and guiding force for
the BAS, was amongthe stu-
dents who took over the
Cathedral of Learning computer
lab in 1969.

The organization traces its
roots to those original protest-
ers.

awakening,” he said.

When asked how he became
interested in medicine, Salk said
he was initially interested in
law.

But the imprints left on his
mind at age four as he watched
carts with cofﬁns pass by during
the Armistice parade at the end
of World War I were enough to
make him change his mind. The
deaths were due to an epidemic
in 1918.

Salk received his doctorate of
medicine in 1939 from New
York University College of
Medicine and started his
research on polio at Pitt in 1947.

In 1965, he was named direc-

tor of the Institute for Biological
Studies in San Diego, Calif,
which was later named the Salk
Institute in his honor.

Among other honors, Salk
was awarded the Presidential
Medal of Freedom in 1977.

A life-size portrait, commis-

sioned in Salk’s honor by the _.

University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, was unveiled at the
Frick Fine Arts Building on
Thursday.

Salk said that he was very

Also, many students did not

“I’ve heard a lot of, ‘Hey, how

T oil/e is cheap

The otherwise peaceful festivities accompanying the
Black Action Society’s Indaba weekend were blemished
Sunday as campus police responded to an urgent
harassment call filed by BAS against two individuals.’

The harassment charge was levelled against two
reporters from The Pitt News who were doing exactly

_ what the BAS has been asking your school’s paper to '
do for months: cover events and activities germane to

thelives of black students.

Black students in attendance, who spoke freely with
the reporters until the .moment of theirlousting, were
suddenly denied the opportunity to express their opin-
ions about the event. ‘In a single stroke, the BAS hierar-
chy passed down yet another decree on how’ black stu-
dents should and should not behave at this university.

The Indaba is an event important to the black commu-
nity and ‘of interest to anyone who pays a student activi-
ties fee. Yet throughout the weekend’s activities, BAS
officers (including Public Relations Chair Kevin Strasser)
declined to offer their opinion on the events for which
they are responsible. » A

Students have the right to know what’s occurring on
campus, and the BAS is arbitrarily shutting students out
because of a disagreement it is having with The Pitt
News. - .

The rift between The Pitt News and BAS is the result of
a continuing crossfire of criticisms and rebuttals, a
shoot—out that some are attempting to portray as pitting
every African American at Pitt against The Pitt News’
editor in chief Julie Sabol. -.

The BAS now “unequivocally” backs Political Action
Chair Oscar Eybers”assertion that the school paper suf-

_ fers from a “predominance” of gays and Jews. The orga-

nization views the paper as wholly biased and as a per-
petuator of racism on campus. The Black Action Society
says it wants’ representation, most importantly on the
editorial board.

One week ago, the position of perspective editor was
open. We ran advertisements encouraging anyone inter-
ested to Contact the editor in chief for an interview. Not
one member of BAS expressed interest in the position.

The Pitt News has an open-door policy. The structure
is informal. T here’s not a “good old boy” in sight. If you
want to write a story about something, and there is no

conﬂict of interest with your doing so, come up and
.type it in. We need the writers. ‘

And for those who wish to count beans, we had no
Jewish or gay editors on the board at the time the state-
ment was made. But we weren’t counting.

What the BAS seems to want is immunity from nega-

in tive coverage. But as the largest student organization,
- with officers in control of large portions of student

activityfunds, we cannot grant that sort of immunity.
And it’s not because we’re racists. It’s because it’s our
job.

Group not representative

As a black professor, I was offended and sad-
dened by the comments of the chairman of the
Black Action Society, as reported in The Pitt
News. Assuming the quotations areaccurate, they
certainly do not reﬂect the dominant views of
blacks on this campusor in the community. Most
of us know who our “real enemies” are and find
ludicrous the notion of Jews and homosexuals
joiningthe Klan or setting black tourists on fire.‘
Indeed, hate groups must be pleased to see
members of one minorityidentifying other
minorities as their “true enemies.” Students inter-
ested in learning more of the historic relations
between blacks and Jews, and in exploring
strategies to improve interracial and interethnic
relations, are urged next term to take a course
entitled Blacks and Jews, team taught by me and
a Jewish professor, Barbara Burstin.

BAS joins Apache struggle
The Political Action Committee of the Black
Action Society supports the efforts of the‘Student
Environmental Action Coalition in its attempts to
keep Mt. Graham, which is sacred land to our

Apache brethren in Arizona, sacred, for now and ’

eternity.

BAS realizes that this land is as sacred to the
Apache and all other indigenous “American”
groups, as is Our Motherland, Africa.

In 1884, a group of European warlords, includ-
ing delegates from the United States, came togeth-
er in. Europe at the Berlin Conference. At this con-
ference, these warlords, who many in the political
science and history departments revere, divided
the entire African continent unto themselves and
used our ‘African bodies as human chattel.

Today the same type of savagery and barbarism
is being used against our family Apache in
Arizona. It would suit O’Connor well to keep his
hands off this land. In the same likeness in which
all of our African ancestors who were savagely
enslaved by these same barbarians, bring light-
ning, earthquakes and storms upon the evil in this
land, so will the Apache bring lightning upon all
who disrespect their land of worship.

Ras Oscar Eybers
, Chairman
Political Action Committee

Black Action Society

Pitt News defended

Mr. Oscar Eybers"remarks about

Jewish and gay predominance on The

Pitt News’ editorial staff, as well as his
remarks about the paper failing the
black community are ludicrous!

If a person is competent and does
their job well that he or she has the
right to get promoted. So if the staff
was predominantly Jewish or gay, as
long as the news kept coming out,
and in a manner that was acceptable
and just, then who cares what the staff
is madeup of? ‘ _

The Pitt News is a great newspaper.
The fact that it is a great newspaper is
due‘ to the talented writers who
express themselves and report, and to
the editorial staff who make sure the
material the writers turn in is appro-
priate for publication. So far there
have been no complaints  except
those of the Black Action Society.

Now, a point was brought up that

there are no black editors on. the staff ‘ '

of The Pitt News. Again I say, “So
what?!” Since everyone has the oppor-
tunity to write for the paper and since
there has been no major b_lack move-
ment to dooso, I must conclude that
blacks do not want to be editors on
The Pitt News. Ms. Sabol also stated
that she doesn’t choose editors by the
color of their skin. And everyone
knows you usually must be a writer
before you can be an editor. You have
to perfect your skills first, so that you
can perfect others’ later. ‘

I say again, obviously blacks don’t
want to be editors, because it appears
that there aren’t'that many black writ-
ers on The Pitt News. If there were,
and they continually wrote, of course
they would bemade editors.

So Isay to you, Mr. Oscar “The
Grouch” Eybers: “Get out of your
garbage can and grow up!”

And to the people who were hurt
by Mr. Eybers’ comments: Hey when
Oscar Eybers talks, people listen
(unfortunately). When people listen,
they get hurt. How do protect your-
self? Simple.

Recently, newspaper and magazine
headlines have heralded the dawn of a
truly new age. According to these
bylines, telecommunications technology
is about to make a quantum leap. This
change will involve a synthesis of televi-
sion, computer and phone technology
which will allow consumers an unprece-
dented amount of freedom. Anything
you want will literally be at your finger-
tips. Wanna watch “Seinfeld” at four in
the morning? No problem! Just dial that
sucker up and it’s yours! TCI of
Pennsylvania, the reigning monarch of
cable television, has even gone so far as
to proudly announce that it has devel-
oped the capability to deliver as many as
500 channels over existing cable lines.
Five hundred channels!

The unspoken assumption is, of

course, that there will be enough enter-

tainment and information out there to fill
that vast, static tundra that we have
come to call television. It still remains to
be seen if it can be done. After all,
America’s already experiencing prob-
lems adequately‘ filling its existing cable
space. The future could hold some very

odd and very esoteric possibilities. As ,

matter of fact, almost any half-baked

. ‘idea could make it onto the airwaves.

So, as I peer into my crystal ball, I see
a very different television world‘ out

there.‘ Many strange and unusual view-

ing options are looming on the horizon,

and I’m the first to tell you about them.
And remember, although I’m presenting
these ideas in jest, it should be remem-

The new age of telev

station satisfies your craving for explana-
tions about what’s really going on out
there. One of this station’s highlights is
the JFK Update, which is hosted by
Oliver Stone.

-The Elvis Network

All Elvis, all the time. Popular features
include rebroadcasts of the King’s Vegas
shows and a

Here are a few of the
more interesting offer-
ings: .
-The Existentialist
Channel

Sean
i McClearn

“Macglaughlin Group”-
style, round-table debate
on the issue of which
movies were Elvis’ best.
Of course, networks

This channel features
one thing and one thing
only: the play Waiting for Godot, 24
hours_a day, seven days a week. The
channel’s’motto is, “It never ends.”

-The Steroid Network

Originally, this was going to be the
professional wrestling network, but the
programmers figured that, except for the
addition of a "few weightlifting shows,
this was the same difference.

-B ‘n’ B TV (Beavis and Butthead
Television)

Butthead: Uh, huh-huh, huh-huh, it’s
about time they gave us our own station!

Beavis: Yeah, dude! Having your own
network is cool! Uh, huh, huh, huh-huh,
huh-huh, huh! _ \

-The Conspiracy Channel

From unidentified ﬂying objects to the
liberal media to the evils of Zionism, this

and superstations only
provide a framework
that enables us to get a look at the meat
and potatoes of television: the individual
programs that provide us with so much
viewing satisfaction.
-ABC’s Wide World of Crime
As the “Big Three” get more desperate
in their attempts to hold on to a dwin-
dling market share, they'll revert back to
some old stand-by (i.e. sex and vio-
lence). This little gem is no exception.
ABC execs are hoping that this show’s
live coverage of rioting and looting in
Cairo will be a big winner come Emmy
time. .
-Paul Reuben’s Hour of Auto-Erotic
Power
Because learning to love yourself is
the greatest love of all. The former star
of “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse” takes us on a

journey through the forbidden realm of
self-stimulation, offering advice on
issues such as how to avoid trouble with
local authorities and where to find the
best porno theaters when you’re on the
road.

-Love Among the Amish

Will Josiah be shunned? What will be
the consequences of Meredith and

' Jacob’s illicit affair? How will it affect the

community? And how will Isaac react on
his return to Lancaster after his trip to
Baltimore and his encounter with televi-

' sion?!?

°Drunkeness and Debauchery

Kick back and watch as various
celebrities and politicians get stinking
drunk and get into trouble. Not one
commandment is left unbroken on this
show! This week watch as Bruce Willis
tries to convince the New York police
department not to take him in on a DUI
charge. The resulting events are a laugh
riot guaranteed to leave you in stitches.

Pretty heady stuff, huh? And this is just
the beginning.

There’s a revolution on the way, and
it’s going to be televised.

I'd tell you about the rest, but I've got
to run. You see, I just a saw a really great
deal on cubic zirconia on the Home
Shopping Channel, and well, you get the
picture_. Until next time.

Unity, not fear for blacks

ision will oﬂer something for as all

On Sept. 7, The Pitt News
reported that Black Action
Society Political Action
Committee Chair Oscar
Eybers remarked that the
newspaper is “failing” the
African-American community
at the university, partially due

nance” of Jews and homosex-
uals on the editorial board.
Eybers was further quoted
from a BAS Political Action
Committee publication and
another conversation as say-
ing that “homosexuality is
evil,” “:1 lot of [African] people
point to the Jewish communi-
ty as one of our greatest ene-
' mies,” and “Jews have always
had rights, always  Inlfact
even if you look at the media
 the majority of them are
run by Jews.”
Mr. Eybers’ comments are
studded with sweeping gen-

stemming from ignorance. A
trip to the local library would
clear up the misconception
that “Jews have always had
rights, always.” My, my, how
quickly and conveniently one
forgets about genocide in this
century. (Let’s pause to be
thankful for a Holocaust
Museum in Washington,
DC.) Any rights that the
Jewish community presently
enjoys across the -globe are
the fruit of centuries of world-
wide organization and effort.
Furthermore, it is appalling
that Mr. Eybers is insinuating
that in the media there is a
Jewish “conspiracy” to por-
tray African Americans in a
negative light. In reference to
The Pitt News, Mr. Eybers did
not rely solely on Jews as a
scapegoat, instead he played
on the prevailing homopho-
bia across campus, too.—That’s

to the seeming “predorni-

eralizations and stereotypes.

a good idea if he wants to lay
the foundation for a purge of
“evil” on campus.

What is the long-term goal

of Mr. Eybers and the Black A

Action Society? I assume (and
pray) it is to improve the
reporting of The Pitt News

and not to incite hatred and

distrust. The Black Action
Society, The Pitt News, faculty
and students should seek a

solution not a scapegoat.

Robeﬁ
Sohn

At BAS‘ Indaba last Friday
an official leaﬂet stated that
“We, the Black Action Society
unequivocally support the
Political Action Chair Ras
Oscar Eybers’ comments
about jewish and gay “pre—
dominance” on The Pitt News

I staff and editorial board.”

(Thank you BAS for further
actions attempting to illegiti-
matize the Jewish community
by not capitalizing the word
‘Jewish.’) It also calls to solve
the main problem: “THE
LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE
PI7T1\/ElVS’STAFF!” ,
Now that the BAS hierarchy
has publicly endorsed Mr.
Eybers’ statements, they joint-
lyblame Jewish and homo-
sexual “predominance” as the
prime cause for the “failing”
of representation of the
African-American community
at the university. A
First of all, Mr. Eybers and
the BAS hierarchy claim there
is a “predominance.” Did Mr.
Eybers and the BAS poll The
Pitt News staff on religious
affiliation and sexual prefer-

Scapegoating, problem not solution

ence? Did they survey first
and last names, physical
appearance and/or style of
dress?
Feingoldenrosenstein-
weissberg. That person must

-be Jewish  Nat. That’s a gay

first name... That person has a
large, hooked nose  Wait. .
Didn’t that person have pink

ushoelaces andan Act-Up pin_

on their backpack?

I severely doubt that was
an actual conversation. Again,
I pray it wasn’t. I do not
know what constitutes the
majority of The Pitt News’ staff
and editorial board. Suppose
the entire "Pitt News’ staff and
editorial board are under rep-
resenting the African-
American community at the
university —- and I think that
they are — should it matter if
one is a Jew or homosexual
or both? Does sexual prefer-
ence and religious affiliation
predetermine the quality of
reporting of the African-
American community? Do
Jews and homosexuals con-

trol all the actions of every

member of The Pitt News’
team? I unequivocally say
they do not.

The main issue is a lack of
diversity. So what do we, the
Black Action Society, The Pitt
News, faculty and students
(Hey, you have a stake in
this, too) do next?

As we decide how to solve
this problem, I implore you to
remember that scapegoating
is not the answer. And if
scapegoating appears to be
the whimsical answer of a
warped few, rise up and fight
against it. Because you may
be the victim tomorrow.

' choosing Pitt are

Being an African-American
student, I knew that coming to a
predominantly-white university
such as the University of
Pittsburgh would be a definite
challenge.

I also realized that I would be
exposed to many new experi-
ences and also forced to face
many harsh reali-

involved. If we all just sit
around and talk about “who’s
not doing what” and “who’s
keeping us down,” then nothing
will ever. get done. We need to
get our priorities straight and
gain courage to stand up and
speak out. We must be heard.
Indeed we all have our own

- ways of express-

UCS.
My reasons for

innumerable,
and now that I
am here, I realize

ing ourselves
and voicing our
opinions. But
each person is
an individual,
and individually

that I have a lot
more work to do
than I ever imagined.

As a first-year student, -I con-
sidered this past weekend to
have been my first real cultural
and social experience here at
Pitt. Of course, as spirited and
jubilant as I am, I looked for-
ward to the weekend’s activities
with a great deal of enthusiasm
and excitement.

On Friday, I attende_d the
Indaba and dance sponsored by
the Black Action Society. For
those of you brothers and sisters
who did not attend, you missed
‘out on a beautiful event. There
is no feeling more special than
to be with your own people. To
see so many beautiful African
people in one place touched me
deeply. A

I felt at peace and at home for
the first time since my arrival at
the University of Pittsburgh.

The discussion at the Indaba
raised many thought provoking
questions about where we stand
as African people, and where
we have to go as African peo-
ple.

I believe that everyone in that
room left with the awareness
that we as African people are
not free — not here at Pitt, not
here in America, not here in the
world. There is a lot that must
be done and everyone must get

we must each
be heard in
order to rise as one person, and
then in turn to rise as a race of
people.

This is not the time to be
afraid, because there is nothing
to be afraid of. As a result of the
arduous struggles that we have
encountered, and continue to
encounter, we are a strong peo-
ple.

No one can divide us but
those who are a part of us. Do
not be hoodwinked into believ-
ing that we are feeble and

' worthless. Remain cognizant of

the strength that you possess
and use it toward a positive
goal.

I would like to personally
applaud and thank the Black
Action Society for the Indaba
and for the many other contri-
butions that it has made to this
campus.

I appreciate what the BAS has
done to raise my consciousness
and awareness about the state
of the African race. .

It is a very positive group of
brothers and sisters.

To the BAS and all my other
brothers and sisters  I love
you. Be safe and stay strong.

Virginia Tech spoils P

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Some people just really don’t

get it.

Virginia Tech University com-
pletely ignored the theater and
drama of what was to be Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors’ tri-
umphant return to Pitt Stadium
by thoroughly dousing the
Panthers’ celebration with a 63-
21 win. '

The Hokies, predicted to ﬁn-

ish in the bottom third of the
Big East and ignited by inﬂam-
matory remarks written in a

local newspaper, controlled the a

game from their second posses-
sion on — not ﬂinching amidst
epithets and banners reading
“Back To The Future.”
And “Homecoming in
September.”
 And “When Johnny comes
marching home again.”
Hurrah. Hurrah.
“They whooped us plain and
simple,” Majors said. “They out-
speeded us and outstrength-

ened us. Even if we executed ‘

  Hokies empty playbook on Pitt: run, run, run

It was the most glaring exam-

perfectly, they still would have
beat us.” ‘ t
V “I really felt like our kids
were ready to play,” Tech head
coach Frank Beamer said. “I
really felt like they worked
awfully hard to be a good foot-
ball team, and‘they’re going in
that direction. I’m not sure that
' we’re there yet, but we’re
going in that direction.”
Tech running back Dwayne
Thomas’ 170 yards rushing

highlighted an option-orientat-'

ed offense executed to perfec-
tion: run and run.
And run.

The Virginia Tech offensive line made life a living hell for Tom Bamdt and Pitt Saturday.

. By Ryan Buncher ‘
Senior Staff‘ Writer

With 1:35 remaining in the
first half of the Pitt-Virginia

Tech game Saturday night at-

Pitt Stadium, the Hokies had
the ball at the Pitt 49-yard line
and took a unique approach to
a two-minute drill.

They ran the ball.

It worked as the Hokies did
not complete a single pass until
Maurice DeShazio hit reserve
tight end Kevin Martin for a 14-
yard touchdown that expanded
Virginia Tech’s lead to 42-6.

ple of how dominating the
Hokie running game was in
the, 63-21, Virginia Tech victo-
ry.

The Hokies rolled over the
Panthers for 500 yards on the
ground, easily outrunning the
old record for Pitt opponents of
464 yards set by Notre Dame in
1971.

“They just whipped us up
front,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said. “They beat us
physically.”

Virginia Tech also set a
record for total yards againsta

Panther defense with 675. The
old record of 647 yards was set
by Army in -1944 with its leg-
endary backfield of Heisman
Trophy winners Doc Blanchard
and Glenn Davis.’

The 63 points was not a
record, but it was the mos_t

‘against the Panthers since Penn
State’s, 65-9, thrashing of Pitt in
1968.

The pounding started early,
as Pitt gave up 111 yards on
the ground in the first quarter.
In addition, Hokie running
back Tommy Edwards turned a

‘The alarm clock rang, albeit
a late 7 p.m. Saturday clang.
And the noise startled some

: Pitt faithful from their comfort-

ing dreamland slumber.

Images of blue and gold, of
victories to come, of Pitt
regaining lost glory swirled in
their heads like sugar plums
on Christmas Eve.‘

But the loud clamor persist- L

ed and the dream’ ended as
quickly as it began. _ '

Awakening to a harsh reali-
ty,‘ Panther fans rubbed their
weary eyes only long enough»
to witness a fiery Virginia Tech
team run over, around and
past Pitt, 63-2], Saturday
evening.

“We got a little dose of reali-
ty,” Pitt free safety Doug
Whaley said after the Hokie_
mulching. “We were flying
high and got a little compla-
cent.”

And a little blown out.

Virginia Tech ran for a
record 500 yards against Pitt
and knocked the Panthers

Good ques-

An answer: an

that was too

team on the rise. Pitt is a
rebuilding team just underway
with its construction.

Fact number two -— The
Hokies have a talented quar-

The Panthers are still inexperi-
enced in the signal-caller
department. 3

Fact number three
Virginia Tech has standout
center Jim Pyne. Pitt has tal-

hard as it did.

Another answer: a team that
refused to make adjustments
in the second half to stop
Curtis Martin.

Yet‘ another answer: A team
that did not have the Hokies’
DeShazo but a straight drop-
back passer who couldn’t run.

All three fit, but the most
pertinent answer and most rel-

The Southern Mississippi game
was a beautiful opener for
Johnny Majors’ second tour as
the Panthers’ head man. ~

The victory, however, in all
its good aspects, created a
mirage that ignited premature
fervor over a young Pitt team
that is only beginning to take
its lumps.

Majors and his coaching staff
knew it, most of the players
knew it, but eager fans wanti-
ng quick success ignored it.

And it was so easy to.

Watching Majors’ pregame
“pep” talk on ESPN, seeing a
fundamentally-sound defense
wearing the new/old Panther
colors and" witnessing Martin
shuffle and cut like Tony
Dorsett, anyone-that enjoys
college football revelled in the
Southern Mississippi game.

But that was Southern

Greetings Pitt Students:

And congratulations! Membership in a University of Pittsburgh
fraternity or sorority is likely to be one of the most rewarding personal
experiences ofyour college career. Pitt’s Greek System fosters long-
term friendships, provides a network of academic and emotional

most obvious during the celebration of Greek Week. The healthy
rivalry that existsamong fraternities and sororities is a positive
expression of the competitive spirit that is so important for personal
growth and success. The fact that a local charity benefits from
_ fundraising activities underscores the commitment that as members of
the Greek System have to the improvement of the world around us.

1 hope you have a safe, enjoyable, and enlightening experience as
a University of Pittsburgh student and as a member of the Greek»

community. Good luck in the chariot races!

he couldn’t ignore the sounds.
The white-painted steel just
wouldn’t lie.

One of Noethling’s second
half shots hit the right post of
an unmanned goal, sending the
Panthers back upfield without a

score and eventually toga 2-0 _

loss to St. John’s Redmen.

“When I first shot it I thought
it went in,” Noethling said. “I
just bent it right into the post. I
had the goalie beat but .it.came
right back.”

It was neither Noethling’s nor
Pitt’s only chance in the frenet-
ic second half to perforate the
Redmen’s All-American candi-
date goalie Jon Urbom, but it

,would prove to be the best

shot the Panthers would have
to register their first goal of the
season. ' v

Carlton Carter registered St.
Johns’ game winner, a header

come and get it, and Carter got
up there and challenged him,
won the ball and banged it in.”
“It shouldn’t have happened,”
Noethling said of the goal. “We
should have been able to come
back from it. But we’ll learn.”
Pitt floundered for much of
the first half, wasting several
scoring chances early but then
watched as St. Johns’ offense
began to take away what Pitt

had enjoyed for the first 25-

plus minutes: offensive pres-
sure.

The second half was differ-
ent, however, as the Panthers
used consistent offensive zone
play to squeeze the Redmen
defense and, save for the ﬁnal
goal, control the period.

“The 2-0 score doesn’t tell
how the game was,” Noethling
said. “I thought we dominated
them for about 25 minutes in
the first half and in the second
half we came out and played
tight, and [St. John’s] really
didn’t do anything except for
that [last] goal.”

Despite the shutout, the
Panthers came away from the
game on a more upbeat note
than after last Sunday’s game
— a 3-0 loss to Bucknell.

“I thought the team played
really well together, despite the
2-0 loss,” Noethling said. “A lot
of kids stepped up and are
ready to play.”

“I was happy with the effort,”
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “I thought we played a
good defensive game. It’s one
of those games where you play

as hard as you could, even 6

though we didn’t play as well
as we could. They’ve just got to
sustain it now.”

“ By Stephen Flinn

Staff‘ Writer

A large portion of the student
section should be commended
for remaining on its feet
throughout the entire first half
of Saturday nights 63-21 ﬁasco,
where one of the few bright
spots to be appreciated the
entire night were the new,
shiny, backlit Coca—Cola adver-
tisements on the left side of the
Pitt Stadium scoreboards.

The first time the Pitt defense
was able to stop the Hokies’
offensive blitzkrieg did not
come until about five minutes
into the second quarter.
However, the lost and hapless
Panthers gladly obliged by
opening up the already
smashed Maginot Line and
committing a personal foul
penalty. Thus, handing-over the
first down to the Hokies, allow-
ing them "to continue for yet
another successful touchdown
drive.

During that particular drive,
the stadium public address
announcer stated, “We have a
lost two—year old at Gate 11.”

We can only imagine how
bad that "poor toddler must
have felt at that moment, but

‘the child’s predicament also

describes the current situation
the Panthers are now in —

‘ very young, very lost andivery

confused.

Even Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors. was a bit confused
about his team. He began his
post-game media interview Hy
asking if there wereany ques-
tions, but promptly reiterated
by asking that if there were any
answers, he would be happy to
hear them. »

“Our first priority right now is

to keep them together,” Majors.

It became obvious that the

second quarter, 42-6, Virginia
Tech. 0

Due to a tenacious and quick
Hokie defense, Pitt’s first half
starting quarterback John Ryan
was stymied.

“We wanted to show them
we had a very good defense
and a quick team,” Virginia
Tech starting roverback Stacy
Henley said. “We knew if our
down linemen could take con-
trol, there was no way they
were going to stop us. We
thought we were better than

Coach Majors opted for a

quarterback change in the sec-
ond half and brought on Ken
Ferguson, who was able to do
at least a little something.

“Things just weren’t going
our way, so I was put in, and I
just tried to do my best,”
Ferguson said.

Even though he was able to
spark some life into the hapless
Panthers, Ferguson was careful
not to attribute “his success to
superior ability over starter
John Ryan.

“Our coaches had time to
analyze the first half and had
somewhat of a feel for what Va
Tech was doing, so they made
some adjustments,” he said.
“T hat’s the main reason I think
I was able to find some gaps in
their defense.

“I don’t think it was a case of
the personnel Va Tech-decided
to use in the second half or my
ability. I really don’t want to
get into comparing myself to
anybody else,” Ferguson said.

Pitt volleyb all   corrals Windy City sweep

Panthers down
W. Michigan,
Portland, DePaul,
improve to 4-2
on the season

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

After losing two of its first
three matches, the Pitt volley~
ball team won all three of its

niatches this weekend at the

DePaul/Revlon Invitational in
Chicago, Ill.

The Panthers (now 4-2 over-
all) lost only one game all
weekend on the way’ to match
victories over Western
Michigan, the University of
Portland and host.DePau1. _

In Friday’s match, Portland
became the only team to

extend Pitt past three games all
weekend.

After the Panthers rolled to
win each of the first two games
by the score of 15-6, the Pilots
ﬂew back into the match with

,.an, 11-15, victory in game

three. Pitt then pasted Portland,
15-5, in the decisive fourth
game. ,

Redshirt junior hitter Carrie
T hornton’s development into a

consistent performer continued»

to be the story of the young
season for Pitt volleyball. She
led Pitt’s attack with 15 kills
and an outstanding .407 hitting
percentage.

Thornton was selected to the
All-Tournament team for the
weekend. '

Redshirt first-year player
Jennie Driscoll, a native of the
Chicago suburb of Wheaton,

Ill., chipped in with 10 kills.
Outside hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie, who garnered MVP
honors in the tournament, had
a strong defensive effort with
21 digs to go along with eight
kills.

On Saturday morning, the
Panthers dispatched the

"Western Michigan Broncos in
three games (15—9, 15-11, 15-9). '

The Broncos were winless for
the weekend.

Pitt finished its weekend with
its most lopsided win of the
season Saturday night against
DePau1. ‘.

The Panthers pounded out a
15-11, 15-9, 15-1, victory
behind an overwhelming
attack, racking up 71 kills and a
.463 hitting percentage for the
match. /

In the final game, that per-

I.D. Required 0 Must be 21

centage shot up to .615.

The Panthers had only nine
hitting errors in the match but
did have 20 errors on serves.

Lucanie paced a balanced
offensive attack with 21 kills
and a .514 percentage.
Thornton and sophomores
Sarah Mikla and Sara Mitchell
also reached double digits in
kills.

Despite continuing problems
with shin splints, junior setter
Annemarie Mernagh joined
Lucanie and Thornton on the
All—Tournament team.

Women’s Tennis Invitational.
All Pitt players failed to win
their opening match in the sin-
gles tournament on Saturday.

In doubles, Pitt’s Barb
McCarthy and Marla Zielinski
won their first match but lost to
cross-town rival Robert Morris
in the second round, putting a
damper on any championship

thoughts. However, Pitt players
faired better in the losers’
bracket.

The No. 1 seed Allison
Baker, No. 2 seed Marla
Zielinski and No. 3 seed Barb
McCarthy all made it to the
semifinals of the Flight A losers’
bracket.

Zielinski was the only
Panther to survive by handing
her own teammate McCarthy a
6-2, 6-3, loss. No. 1 seed Baker
lost a very tough match to Erin
Schlegal of Robert Morris, 7-6,
6-4.

The No. 4 seed Tammy
Keister made it to the Flight B
finals but lost 6-2, 6-5, to
Melissa Lockhart of Robert
Morris. ,

“This tournament was really
positive for our team to start off
and have strong performances
against good competition,” Pitt

head coach
Dieffenbach said.

“It was also good because
there was less pressure on the
players because it was set up
as a singles tournament, not a
team competition.”

“Tammy [Keister] had a real
strong performance this week-
end and Allison [Baker] had a
big win over Duquesne’s Kelly
Martin,” said Dieffenbach.

Coach Dieffenbach put it

George

mildly when he said this sea— L

son was a rebuilding year.

The inexperienced Panthers
will rely on No. 1 and No. 2
seeds sophomores Allison
Baker and Marla Zielinski.
Tammy Keister is a junior and
Barb McCarthy is the only
senior on the team.

The women’s tennis team
plays next ‘on Thursday,
September 16 at St. Francis.

The Hokies racked up 500

yards on the ground — 252 in
the first half -— while scoring
on seven consecutive posses-
sions. '
“I felt like our running backs
ran with great effort  reckless-
ness and toughness,” Beamer
said. “Most of the time their
_shoulders were going toward
the goal line. That’s nice to
see.”

“They couldn’t stop us when
we wanted to go,” Tech center
Jim Pyne said. “[The key is]
taking care of the ball and
eliminating mistakes.”

Thomas’ statistics are the
more outstanding considering
that he gained 106 yards on his
final seven carries —- all in the
second half..

“I started out a little slow, but
after that, I focused,” Thomas
said. “Our whole team got

focused after [Pitt’s first field.

goal]  we got something to
do this year. We have some-
thing to prove this year.”

It is scary to think of the

' numbers it could have laid on

the Panthers had this team got-
ten any more focused.

Tech had three other _runners
over 54 yards —— Ranall White
(81 yards), Brian Edmonds (62)
and Tommy Edwards (54) —
but senior quarterback Maurice
Deshazo ultimately stole the
show.

DeShazo ran the option with
rapier-like precision, exploiting

obvious size and strength deﬁ- ‘

ciencies in Pitt’s overmatched
defensive line.- A. — A

he did in high school, but now

The Tech quarterback ran for

only 40 yards and a touchdown
but did the majority of his dam-
age through the air. When not
eluding. a defensive end‘ on, an
option that even the Big Efiglit
would envy, Deshazo was easi-
ly funding holes in the Panthers’
secondary.
' It became so automatic for

threat —— a pin-ball touchdown

Martin and a TD reception by

unit to quell what had become
a mild uprising.

Result? The Hokies rolled on
an 11-play, 80-yard touchdown
drive highlighted by a DeShazo

Steve Sanders. ‘

“Our plan. will never be not

Beamer said. “I believe that's

Curtis Martin's 51-yard touchdown scamper was one of Pitt's few highlights Saturday night.

the ball up the middle, and
right now, we’re about to
attack all parts of the field.”
There were few, if any at all,
bright spots for Pitt. Rookie
kicker Steve Kalmanides boot-
ed his first two field goals of
his career — from 36 and 22
yards.
- Short of that, there wasn’t to
much to be happy with on the

Pitt sidelines.

Linebacker Gerald Simpson
was injured early in the first
quarter with a right-knee injury,
and defensive ends Dell
Seagraves and Zatiti Moody
likewise missed game time with
a pair of injured knees.

The Panthers suffered their‘

worst ever defensive perfor-
mance Saturday night. Never

before had they given up as
many yards rushing (500) or
yards overall (675). The 42-
point defeat also went down as
Pitt’s worst opening day home
loss, eclipsing the previous

 

mark of 41 points (41-0) against
Notre Dame in 1943.

“I never expected to come in
and have that kind of game,”
Edwards said. “We executed
our plays great, our line did a
great job and the fullback
blocked the hell out of them.”

Several Hokies were out-

wardly bitter after the game at’

remarks in Saturday’s edition of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and
said that the article was used as
motivation for the win.

“They brought [the beating]
on themselves,” Tech center
Jim Pyne said.

“The Pittsburgh [Post] Gazette
was saying ‘technical knock-
out’ and ‘weak Virginia Tech
team,’ so we read it last night
before the game in a meeting
and it  really motivated us
and we kicked the crap out of
them.” -

“They disrespected us in the
papers, but I’m not going to
disrespect them now,” Deshazo
said. 9

“They’re a good football team
but we just came hungry to
win.”

The Hokies introduced the
1993 Panthers to “smash-
mouth” football Saturday
night and challenged Pitt to
stop the run.

Using the quick feet of
DeShazo to pace the option,
Virginia Tech threw only
when necessary ——- and quite
often, accurately.

The team used no trick
plays, it didn’t need any.

"The Hokies just ran inside
and out with a trio of tireless
backs that the Panthers
couldn’t handle.

“Virginia Tech’s speed is
good,” Majors said after the
game. “Our speed is below
average.”

Nothing was better on the
offensive side of the ball

~ either, Virginia Tech followed
Martin closer than his shadow
did. _

Stopping the run, the
Hokies forced Pitt quarterback
John Ryan to throw down-
field. '

When Ryan continued to
throw short out passes to his
running backs, Virginia Tech

I put eight defenders on or

and bottled up the Panther

tantly, the final sum shows a

Ring, ring, ring. The alarm

Wake up Pitt fans, this

short pass into a 55-yard touch-
down.

Virginia Tech rumbled for
252 yards rushing in the first
half, mostly attacking the out-
side with sweeps and options.

“I’d say [their team speed] is
good,” Majors said. “Our speed
is below average.”

Pitt was never able to stop
the option, and by the second
half, the Hokies were consis-
tently effective on all aspects of
the play, even the drive up the
middle.

“I think we’ve got the great-
est option quarterback in the
country,” Virginia Tech Coach
Frank Beamer said of
DeShazio, who ran for 40 yards
and a touchdown in the con-
test.

As the Hokies added yards,
Pitt lost defenders. On the sec-
ond defensive series of the
game, outside linebacker
Gerald Simpson left the game

with a sprained right knee. On‘

the other side,» linebacker Tom
Tumulty fell on his infected
elbow early and was limited in
the first half. He did not return
for the second half.

“I landed on it and it took
me out of my game,” Tumulty
said. “I was playing with one
arm. It was myidecision [to
play], but that hit took me out
of my game.”

Defensive ends Dell
Seagraves and Zatiti Moody
both left the game with knee
injuries.

Virginia Tech broke the 300-
yard rushing mark as the third
quarter opened when Dwayne
Thomas broke loose for a 70-
yard touchdown.

Thomas racked up 170 yards
and two. touchdowns on 19
carries. His previous career-
high rushing total had been 70
yards.

to the Citibank Photocard, the only credit card with your photo on it. A voice inside says, “This

is mejreally me.”»(As opposed to, “Who the heck is that?”—a common response to the photo

on one’s driver’s license.) It’s‘ an immediate form of
