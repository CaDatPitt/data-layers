iGives Results
.In Fund Drive

In spite of a 10 per cent de-
crease in enrollment, the stu-
‘ dent contributions to the Unit-
.ed War Fund drive have ex-
eeeded last year’s total by 20 per

. ‘cent. And there are still more con-

tributions expected.

The total for this year reached
33,554 on Friday afternoon. This
averages about $1.50 per student
'_which is better than the $1.08 aver-
-age of last year.

Faculty and University employ-
ees had already increased their
last year's contribution by over

. $1,000 when they turned in a total
of $8,521.25 Friday evening.
Pledges for this campus drive are
due in the Treasurer’s office, 2409
Gathedral, by December 10. “Nat-
u-rally, we would appreciate those
payments being made as soon as
possible,” said Harold Gondelman,
chairman of the student drive.

Both Theodore W. Biddle. dean

the enthusiasm shown toward the

Havlal< Receives
2nd Promotion

_ William R. Havlak, assistant pro-
fessor of military science, has been
promoted from the rank of ﬁrst
lieutenant to captain.

Captain Havlak, a native of Pitts-
burgh, graduated from Pitt in the
class of 1934 as a civil engineer. He
was transferred to the University
by the U. S. Army Third Corps
service command, to serve as an in-
structor of military science in Sep-
tember, 1940.

Prominent in many activities
while in school, Captain Havlak was
cadet colonel of the ROTC unit, the
ﬁrst captain of Pitt Riﬂes, honorary
military fraternity for freshmen
and sophomores, and a member of
ODK, national senior activities fra-
ternity.

beginning November 13, at 12:45
o’clock in the Heinz Memorial Chap-
el under the sponsorship of the Re-
ligious Activities committee headed
by Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men.

Heinz Chapel was originally built
for student use, but until now it
has served primarily for Sunday
and holiday worship with an occa-
sional musical service scheduled.

This year the Religious Activities
committee comprised of University
chaplain Dr. William Farmer, di-
rector of women’s student health

Fraternities
Seek New
Pledge Rule

Interfraternity council at a
meeting last Tuesday evening
appointed ﬁve senior men to
assist dean of men Theodore
W. Biddle in the interviewing of
prospective council officers for the
next school year. The men are Dick
Griffith, C43, Joseph Leonard, E43,
William Clemmer, C43, Leonard

’ Wolk, BA43, and Frank Richmond,

E43.

Interviews will , be conducted
toward the end of this month, ac-
cording to Dave Truan, C43, coun-
cil secretary.

IFC also passed a motion recom-
mending to the men's fraternity
committee that initiation rules be
waived in the case of pledges who
are about to be inducted into the
armed services. This would enable
the pledges to become full-ﬂedged
members before they are called
into duty.

With a unanimous vote, the coun-
cil admitted Alpha Phi Delta fra-
ternity within their ranks and
placed it on probation for one year.
Alpha Phi Delta received its char-
ter last February and has increased
its number to 35 active members.

Martin Faberman, C44, was
appointed to supervise pledge-
social activities including a
pledge dance and a smoker, the
committees for which will be com-
posed of and headed by pledges.
A pledge banquet has been sched-
uled for November 23 with John
Shephard, BA44, directing the
committee planning.

At the meeting, Dr. Peter Gray,

of the University Defense, asked
that the fraternities provide volun-
teers for service in the Cathedral
during evening air drills. The fra-
ternities immediately offered the
aides and a plan was made whereby
two fraternities will be ready at
all times to send any men that
might be called for. Fraternity men
will also act as stair guards dur.
ing air raid warnings in the day-
time.

Education and the W/ar 

The following story is, we believe, important to 
each single student in every American college or univer-, \

sity. It gives the latest developments in the conferences
between the Army, the Navy, and the schools. We know
they're the- latest available facts because vice-Chaincellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald secured permission for the Pitt
News to print the following story by wire from Guy
Snavcly, executive director of the Association of Amer-

ican colleges.—-The Editor.
By IRWIN ROSEN

That the American colleges and Universities will soon
face the most sweeping changes in their history was made

quite evident to me last Friday, as, for over two hours, Vice- »

chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, committee reports and con.
ference minutes before him, proceeded to make known what's
going to happen to our colleges and universities because of
the war.

The direct future is uncertain. The schools and colleges
are at present negotiating with representatives of the armed
forces as to the role higher education shall play in the war
effort. In addition to being motivated by a sincere desire to do
all they can to help win the war, the schools would, of course,
welcome any government plan that would help them maintain
their existence during the present emergency.

The army and the navy have, on the other hand, trained
manpower needs which must be ﬁlled and ﬁlled quickly for
effective ﬁghting of the war. And with the 18-19 year draft
law just about a certainty, the armed forces and the represen-
tatives of higher education at present confer——the army and
navy troubled with their trained manpower problem, the edu-
cators facing the grim prospect of hundreds of schools “closed
for the duration.”

Representing higher education is the Day committee-
chairmanned by Cornell University's president, Edmond Day.
The Day committee is negotiating with a nine-man joint army-

navy board, comprised of representatives from virtually every —

service arm.

Upon the outcome of these historic meetings at Wash-
ington depends the future of every American college and
University. .

What the army and navy want the schools to do is still
unknown. What the schools would like the army and the navy
to do was made clear by a report of the Day committee to the
American council on Education two weeks ago.

Following is the plan to be submitted to a joint army-
navy board by the Day committee. It is in no way indicative
of the exact future of the schools, because this report must be
compromised with the plans of the army and the navy.

The Day committee report has as its objetcives: _

1. To utilize American institutions of higher education more ex-
tensively as centers for training highly qualiﬁed young men as prospec-

tive specialists and officers in the armed forces. ‘

2. To do so on the broad democratic basis of selecting young men
for such training irrespective of their economic status.

Toward these objectives .the Committee recommends establishment
of Enlisted Training Corps in the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast
Guard, to be located at approved institutions of higher education. .

(Editor’s Note: These approved institutions will amount to about 200
colleges throughout the country. There are 1500 college: and universities in
the  S. What will happen to the other 1300 school: is not stated in the re-

ort.
1’ And here's what higher education would like the structure of the
above mentioned enlisted reserve corps to be: i
1. The respective corps shall be open to all male graduates of high
schools and other males of equivalent education who meet competitive
standards. Selection of candidates shall be made by appropriate military
authorities.
2. Enisted candidates may apply to any University for training,
under a program approved by army and navy authorities.
3. Enlisted candidates shall pursue year-round curricula for four
semesters or their equivalent in length.
4. Enlisted candidates shall receive base pay and subsidies while
attending colleges and universities as members of the Corps.

This, in essence, is the Day committee's plan, which it will work
for in conference—certain schools being selected as training centers, run
with a marked similarity to Annapolis and West Point, four semesters
of pre—service training, with pay and subsidies for the enlistee.

But, it must be made clear—-this is not the last word. There are

"America" Play

Beaux Art will present the story
of America through the medium of
speech, song, and dancelat 3:45
o’clock in the Social Room of the
Stephen‘ Foster Memorial on Thurs-
day, November 12.

Miss Ruth Haun, director of
Women’s speech association, has
arranged the verse of America for
this program. “Here is an effort
to make clear to University _women
the meaning of America, itsgstory
o'f "struggle and joy and its partici-
pation in this war for freedom,”
Miss Haun states. 1

The drama of America unfolds
through the art of poetry. Euch
writers as Benet, Masters, Tag-
gard, and MacLeish are repre-
sented.

An excerpt is taken from The
Murder of Lidice by Edna St. Vin-
cent Millay. Franklin P. Adams in-
his introduction to this brilliant-
work writes, “When the meaning of
‘Lidice’ is understood by every
American we will never stop short
of totalivictory.” ’ A

and the Cornhuskers are being-

up a 9-7 win to clinch the Rose
Bowl trip for themselves. The one
loss suffered in Nebraska happened
so long ago that it is said that in
the home of the Cornhuskers the
man who saw Lincoln runs a poor
second to the man who saw
Nebraska beat the Panthers on
home soil.
But the Nebraskans came pretty
close to sending the Panthers
home with a 7-0 defeat last year.
They completely outplayed the
Pitts for three quarters, then in
the ﬁnal quarter Pitt pushed over
a touchdown to tie score and, with
seconds left to play, Edgar Special
Delivery, Frank Merriwell, Jone-
sey Old Boy, Jones committed
grand larceny on a Cornhusker
pass and dashed 60 yards for the
winning touchdown.
Nebrask_a is the fourth team Pitt
has played this year which has had

a 15-2 score, no small feat as every-
one knows, and who should know
better than our own battle-scarred
Panthers.

The fact that they lost a one-
sided 26-6 contest to Missouri on
Saturday does not brighten the
outlook for the Panthers, for the
Cornhuskers will be trying harder
than ever to resume their winning

pways, particularly as their next
engagement is with Bernie Bier-
man’s Iowa Seahawks.

What ever the 59-19 shellacking
may have done to the Panther men-
tal state will not be known until
next week, but physically they
emerged unscathed and should be at
full strength for the Nebraska tilt.
They made only one mistake in the
Ohio State game and that was in
going to Columbus in the first place.
This is one error you may be sure
they will not repeat.

Pitt Frosh Team Extends
U Vaunted Buckeye Eleven

 

Fight and determination was all
the Pitt freshman squad could show
at the Ohio Stadium last. Friday

. afternoon, but for 45 minutes it was
enough. Finally the power of the
heavily manned Ohio State frosh
began to show and they romped
home with a 19-7 victory.

,Witness.ed by 2,800 fans, the two
yearling squads put on as ﬁne a
battle as ever seen in the Stadium.
Ohio State’s Lou Grozna, Martins
Ferry boy, won plaudits of the

_ crowd for his magniﬁcent place
kicking. He scored seven points,
6 on ﬁeld goals, and one extra
point.

Pitt’s triple threat freshman, De-
Mar, halfbacks Crooks and Watson,
quarterback Catarnella, and line-
men Novak and Cummins merited
attention by their spectacular play.
These freshmen will, no doubt, see
a great deal of action against Penn
State on the 21st of November.

Ohio State drew ﬁrst blood in the
ball game when they, on a sustained
drivelof 60 yards, drove over tackle
from the six for the ﬁrst tally.

A few minutes later, Groza
kicked a 20 ﬁeld goal, directly be-
, twen the uprights.

Pitt, sparked by DeMar and

Watson, advanced the ball for 25
yards. Then DeMar around end for
51 yards and a touchdown. The
score, at that moment, was -7.

Extra Gasoline Given

Commuting Students

For those students living in lo-
calities necessitating the use of au-
tomobiles, gasoline allowances will
be made. This information reaches
us from William M. Griest, state ra-
tioning officer.

Since the pursuit of a college ed-
ucation is considered an “occupa-
tion,” commuting students who lack
any other adequate means of trans-
portation will receive allowances of
occupational mileage. This depends
on the fulﬁllment of ride-sharing
requirements. No rationing board
will grant more than an average of
470 occupational miles a month.

This recognition of students, it
is hoped, will aid their attendance
of college.

In Greek League Playoffs

The Rose Bowl game of the.fra-

when the Phi Kaps and the_ PiKa’s
meet’ to decide the intrafraternity
championship.

Phi Kappa is basing its hopes
for victory on its star back, Mc-
Donough, and ends Bob and Chuck
Cusick. The PiKa’s will counter
with Bobby Artman, Paul Loh-
meyer, and Gus Wilde.

The Phi Kaps gained their place
in the championship game by elimi-
nating Theta Chi in the game
payed November 5. Although ﬁnally
winning the game, 20-13, the Phi
Kaps were hard pressed by the
never-say-die members of Theta
Chi. With only two minutes left to
play, and score 13-7 in favor of
Phi Kappa, Theta Chi pushed over
a touchdown that deadlocked the
game at 13-13.

When asked what she thought of

“I am very interested in Pitt . . .
