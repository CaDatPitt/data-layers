Dr. Peake Appoints NewCommittee.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

S G Votes New Policy;
Allocations Group Chosen

 An amendment allowing
Student Government. (SG) to
select all four members of the
Student Activities Fee Allo-
cation Committee was pass-
ed by SG Thursday. The

amendment went into immediate
effect, and the Senate chose the
four members of the committee
who will serve for the next three
trimesters.

Previously, only two members
of the Allocations Committee
were chosen, by SG, with the
others being selected by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.
very point of whether SG should

-appoint all of the committee

members or not was a major ar-
gument when the Student Activ-

. ities Fee bill was originally pre-

 

sented last fall. This disagree-
ment led to the administration’s
taking action and the subsequent
resignation of Eric Stern, SG pres-
ident at the time.

Janet Berson, liberal arts (LA)
junior; Bill Cabin, LA junior;
Richard Thuss, engineering jun-
ior; and Ann Bush,’ LA sopho-
more, were elected to the com-
mittee positions. Miss Berson has
served on the Allocations Com-
mittee since February and is the
only lmember with previous ex-
perience on the committee.

This '

SG also considered a bill intro-
duced by Senator Ronald Cowell
concerning the approval of allo-

cations made by the Allocations

Committee during the spring tri-
mester. This bill provides that
two-thirds of the senators will be
notiﬁed that allocations will be
voted upon, so that they can be
pre.sent to vote on allocations if
they so desire.

The need for this bill was ques-
tioned by Senators Loren Her-.
shey, Terry Hyman, and Cathy
Baierl on the grounds that par-
liamentary rules already covered
the situation, but the bill was
passed over their objections.

In the last business dealing
without revision the allocations
with _allocations, SG. approved
for Pitt Players and the Student
Union Board which it had return-
ed to the Allocations Committee
for reconsideration.

In other action, Senator Hy-
man announced that the referen-
dum vote on the constitution ap-
proved last week by SG will prob-

ably be held April ,4 and 5. Vot-'

ing booths will be set up in the
Towers Lobby and the Commons
Room. Hyman stressed the need
for strong student support in the
referendum.

Prof Says US. Overlooks

Vietnam Social Revolution

By HOBARTSHARRIS -

Dr. Allen Pollack, instructor of history, expressed his I

fear that the United States might not learn from its mis-
takes in Vietnam in an address at the Phi Eta Sigma, fresh-
man scholastic honorary, initiation banquet last Monday.

Referring to the “ivory tower
isolation” of the American view
of the world, he said that we
have failed to recognizethe true
nature of the “basic social revolu-
tion” -in Vietnam. "

Dr. Pollack said that the un-
derdeveloped . two-thirds of me

world is at approximately the-

same point in its history that
Western Europe was in the 19th
century. By this, he meant that
these countries are facing the
“traumatic”
ism and economic change.

These forces are making a bas-
ic social revolution “inevitable,”
he said. Furthermore the “old re-
gimes” now in power neither
have the wish nor the capabil-
ities to change. They‘ are oli-
garchical, self-interest groups or-
ganized to perpetuate themselves
in power. .

This means, according to Dr.
Pollack, that they are. the nat-
ural enemies of the populations
of the countries they rule. And,
just as social revolution occurred
in Europe, it will occur in the
underdeveloped countries. The.
question then becomes “not
whether the revolution -will oc-
cur, but in. whose name it will

The result of our opposition will
be the alienation of all social re-

proposed state-relatedness was
given by Senator Gabrielle Ed-
wards. She noted that 2,150 stu-
dents had participated in the
poll and that “hopefully, the re-
sults will be in by the end of the
term.”

Roy Meckler also announced
his resignation as publicity man-
ager of SG and chairman of the
SG calendar committee. Marc
Speigel, present co-ordinator of
University organizations and
events for SG, is expected to as-
sume these positions.

University To Study   
Instruction Technology

By FRED FRANK D

Dr. Charles H. Peake, vice-chancellorfor the academic 1
disciplines,‘ has appointed a standing Committee on Instruc-z:
tional Technology. Dr. Peake stated that the essential mis-
sion of the committee will be to incorporate recent develops‘?
ment in instructional technology and information handling
into plans for future academic programs at the University)

Dr. Peake felt that whatever
formal ‘reorganization the Uni-
versity might eventually adopt
under the new state-related stat-
us, certain considerations must
be studied now, so that plans can

be developed and experimental‘

programs set up as soon as pos-
sible.

He explained that consideration
must be given to the develop-
ment .of ﬂexibility of program
and method which will facilitate
varyingrates of progress accord-
ing to the .individual’s ability, mo-
tivation, and effort.

A second deﬁnite need, accord-
ing to Dr. Peake, is to utilize new
technologies. While most of this
type" of research has been de-
voted, to sub-colleg-e levels, Dr.
Peake said, “the upward move-
ment is inescapable, and in, time
the impact must be on higher
education.” ' ’

A similar development now
centers around information han-

dling and the role of the library _

in the instructional process. Dr.

V_Peake has asked that these de-

velopments be studied as future
plans for incorporation in aca-
demic programs.

Dr. Peake also suggested that
the committee determine speciﬁc
areas where the new approaches
can ﬁnd the most immediate and
feasible application.

The committee has been asked
to set up, in- co-operation with
the School of Liberal ‘Arts, a
series of pilot programs, which
"can be evaluated for purposes of
more comprehensive planning and
implementations. It will also be
the job of the committee to make
recommendations. for new facil-
ities to house. the programs they
suggest.

. Dr. Peake hoped that investi-

Area Schools Fear Tuition Cut

Duquesne University and Mt. Mercy'College expressed
fears of the impact of the proposed cut in the University’s
tuition on their enrollments before a State House Commit-
tee on Higher Education in Pittsburgh.

The presidents of these schools told the committee that

they might lose most of their commuters to the University

if tuition is cut from $1,400 to
$450. Mt. Mercy’s commuter ap-
plicants for the fall are already
runing 22 per cent behind last
year, and could cost the school
$35,000 in tuition.

Father’ Henry J. McAnulty,
president of Duquesne, was quot-

.ed in the Pittsburgh Press as say-
ing, “Some of our upperclassmen .
have told. me. that they are'_go- ,

     
   

ing: .to_/transfer I to —— Pitt," . 

or of a gradual reduction in tui-
tion at the University. spread
over three years, rather than tak-
ing off the $1,000 all ationce.
Sister Thomas Acquinas, presi-
dentof Mt. Mercy objected to the
ﬂat reduction in,the University’s
tuition because -* “There is no

guarantee under this plan that it
is the needy student who is able l
to. take advantage :-of the low,

Dividing his time among
Vice-President Hubert Hum-
phrey, the City of Pitts-
burgh, his law ﬁrm, and his
wife and four children keeps
Council Peter F. Flaherty an
active politician, lawyer, and fam-
ily man. Broadening his scope
even more, Councilman Flaherty
added another dimension to his
schedule last January, when he
enrolled in the University’s Grad-
uate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs (GSPIA).

“Upon being elected to City
Council last November, I felt
courses in urban affairs provided
an excellent opportunity to take
advantage of University training
in combination with my work,”
Cou'nci1man Flaherty commented.
“Here at the University, I can
get ideas from men who have
studied municipal problems from
all over the country and can ex-
change ideas with students of ur-
ban affairs from all over the
world,” he pointed out.

Councilman Flaherty empha-
sized that “this exchange of ideas
plus the academic work itself is
an invaluable experience to par-
ticipate in while serving on City
Council.” In addition to serving
on Council and attending GSPIA,
Councilman Flaherty practices
law and “tries to spend time with
his family.”

During the 1964 presidential
campaign, Councilman Flaherty
served as an advance man for
Vice-President Humphrey, trav-
eling from city to city through-
out the country. “Being an ad-
vance man was a unique experi-
ence,” Flaherty related. “It at’-
forded me the opportunity to

 learn first-hand about the politi-
" cal situation

in many of the
cities in the United States. Again,

; the exchange of ideas proved in-

valuable in my political career.”

Councilman Flaherty volunteer-
ed for his assignment with the
Vice-President through Democrat-
ic Natlonal Committee. He was
selected to work with Vice-Presi-
dent Humphrey after participat-

'ing in an orientation program.

He has since assisted the Vice-
President _on numerous occasions.

His own opportunity to run for
public office came last year when
he was selected to run for City
Council on the Democratic tick-

of victory as he led the Demo-
cratic Party of Allegheny County
with the highest number of votes.

A native of Pittsburgh, Coun-
cilman Flaherty graduated from
Notre Dame University with high-
est honors and later earned his
law degree from the same insti-
tution. He is now working to-
ward’s a master’s degree at
GSPIA.

Draft Status
Talk Planned

University students with ques-
tions concerning the draft and
their present status as under-
graduates may ﬁnd some answers
in a special program to be spon-
sored by Men’s Council Wednes-
day at 7 p.m. in the Private Din-
ing Room of Tower A.

The program will consist of
lectures by Lt. Col. John Hetzel
and Lt. Col. William Grimm, both
of Pennsylvania’s Selective Serv-
ice System. A question and ans-
wer period will follow the speech-
es. The coming nation-wide draft
tests will be discussed.

Vietnam
Revolution

(Continued from Page 1)
tional revolutions as the cause of
the revolutionary’s antagonisms
towards us, and not anything in-
herent within the revolutionist’s
doctrines.

Dr. Pollack called for a basic
change in America’s attitudes.
“We must decide that anti-Com-
munism is not the most impor-
tant thing, but social revolution
is. We are turning these revolu-
tions against us instead of forcing
social change in those areas in
which we have inﬂuence.”

Dr. Pollack pointed to Thai-
land as the next testing ground
of U.S. policy. So far we have not
learned from our experiences in
Vietnam, he felt, and instead of
promoting the “basic social
changes” that will enable Thai-
land to advance within a west-
ern-democratic fname of inﬂu-
ence,” we are shipping in bomb-
ers, ammunition, and guns.”
These actions will force Thai-
land's revolution into an essen-
tially anti-democratic, anti-west-
ern orientation, he said.

Dr. Pollack described the‘atti-
tudes which America has that iso-
lated it within its “ivory tower.”
He felt that this has been the re-
sult of several factors, among
them the relative immaturity of
America. This is evidenced in
our inability to perceive that
other peoples of the world have
basically different values than
the U.S., and that they can there-
fore not be expected to aspire to
all of the things that we do. “We
think that our ideals are the only
ideals and we refuse to under-
stand other civilizations,” he said.

The result of this is a series of
unintentional -hyprocrisies in
which we tell the world that we
believe in democracy and self-
determination and then turn
around and destroy popular rev-
olutions which we perceive as
anti—Ameriean, as we did in the
Dominican Republic...The under-
developed countries, seeing these
actions come to the conclusion
that we are lying, and that we
are really the reactionaries that
the Communists say we are, he
concluded. '

Seeks State Position  

Bill Lerach, junior politi-
cal science major at the Uni-
versity, is campaigning for
election to the office of chair-
man of the Young Republi-
can College Council of Penn-
sylvania. Lerach is presently
vice—president of the Univer-
sity Young Republicans
(YR) and director of education

for the College Council.

Lerach has stressed “the im-

portance of youth” in his cam-‘

paign, pointing out that “in 1968
there will be 12 million new
young voters, which means that
the political parties will have to
get to the young people.” ‘

He has spoken at the Universi-
ty in the course of his campaign
and is scheduled to appear at
Mansﬁeld State Teacher’s Col-
lege, Penn State, Bucknell Uni-
versity and Allegheny College.

The State Convention will be
held May 6 and 7 in Harrisburg,
and will be attended by nea_rly
40 college Republican clubs. As of
now, Lerach is the only an-
nounced candidate,‘ but he ex-
pects someone to announce can-
didacy from the eastern part of
the state.

If elected, Lerach would work
with the Republican State Com-
mittee and aid Republican guber-
natorial candidate Lt. Governor
Ray Shafer in his campaign. In
addition, he would travel to Penn-
sylvania colleges and speak to
YR clubs, and help organize YR

litical science major, is serving
as Lerach’s campaign manager.

Four years ago Bobby Dy-

horrible, his music and lyrics
brilliant, and his guitar styl-

October. His voice was still
horrible, and his music and

There was only one change
l——he appeared with an elec-
tric guitar and a combo. He
was virtually booed off stage.

THE MOST surprising as-
pect of the Forest Hills con-
cert was that the crowd was
composed almost exclusively
of Dylan fans, a fraternity
-of folk music affectionadoes
who, over the last few years,
‘had raised Dylan to the stat-
: us of a minor deity. And this
concert was not the last at
which he was booed by his
fans. It has happened at al-

ugly. .

Honesty and individualism
have always been Dylan’s
hallmarks. More than any-
thing else, Dylan has been
singing of himself, his feel-
ings, his world. In an inter-
view in this month’s Play-
boy, he said, “It’s very tir-
ing having other people tell
you how much they dig you
if you yourself don’t dig‘ you.
. . . What happens on the
stage is straight. . . . It’s ul-
tra simple, and would exist
whether anybody was look-
ing or not.”

NO ONE was more disap-
pointed by his reception
when he came out with the
electric guitar than Dylan
himself. Although he ‘had
had no more delusions about
the quality of his voice than
his fans, he had become con-
vinced that he was a success,
and that his success was
based on his writing and the
amount of emotion he could
inject into his performance.

But the lyrics and the con-
viction hadn’t changed, and
certainly not the honesty.
Only the electric guitar was
new. Why was it so repul-
sive? _

The problem didn't lie with
Dylan or his guitar, but with
the motivations of his fans.
Dylan’s style naturally lends
itself to an aesthetic intel-
lectually oriented type of
person. But how many of us
can really say what such an
orientation is? And if we
could, where would we put
“camp”?

SO, FOR THE majority of
this type of person, as for
the majority of people in
any major orientation, in-
cluding intellectuals, the only
answer to this problem is to

Editorial: Peake’s Progressive Perspective   5

serves as the foundation for building an educational framework attuned
to “individualization” and the use of new facilities and research-tested

Dr. Peake’s proposed steps for developing such a system represent

mama to students who have been craving for a more flexible educational ‘
system. The use of achievement tests and appropriate study programs
geared to them would allowfor the differential abilities of students-
something accounted for now only by a shabby system of advanced place-

ment. It would also complement the increasing acceleration of high school

University.

in order to keep your identi-
t_v make sure what you’re
doing is sufficiently different
from everyone else. «

In this sense, the Dylan
cult had many of the aspects
of a fad. It was new, fresh,
and original. Most‘ important
of all, it appeared to be in-

tellectual—we somehow con-

sider‘ the baring _of one’s-soul
to be ”the epitomy of" intel-
lectualism, as if profound
sorrow is the natural state
of the intellectual. Beer is
for the masses.

S0, DYLAN wasall right
as long as he was able to
maintain a clear distinction
between what he was doing
and what everybody else
was. Then came the Forest
Hills concert, and reason that
the electric guitar elicited

such revulsion is the false"

perception on. the part of
the audience of what Dylan
was doing, and what the elec-
tric guitar represented. To
Dylan, the guitar was simply
a tool with which he.would
add another dimension to his

performance. However, to I

the crowd it represented
something entirely different
—the guitar looked ‘suspici-
ously like folk-rock, and folk-
rock looked suspiciously like

an unholy prostitution of

traditional folk music.

It has been said by many
contemporary sociologists
that nothing kills a fad
among the college age group
faster than having the high
schools and junior highs pick
it up. Folk Rock, as a recog-
nized school, preceded Dy-
lan’s performance by at least
six months. Sonny and Cher,
the Byrds, and several other
groups were all there first.
And, if it is disturbing to
ﬁnd that the high schools
have expropriated one of
yours idols after you have
made him famous, it must be
humiliating to ﬁnd that they
have come up to his art. And
that’s what happened to Dy-
lan. ' Completely by mistake,
and motivated by nothing
more than his desire to “dig”

himself. Dylan committed

position where they might
have to admit that they have
something in common with
their less intellectually in-
clined bretheren.

This explanation is prob-
ably sufficient to explain the
extreme emotional reaction

-of the audience. If it is‘ true-

that vmost of these people
were using Dylan as a prop
to their own pretensions,
than the more strongly they
held or needed those preten-
sions the stronger would be
the reaction when theywere
challenged. And What can
be more challenging to the
kind of person who views
himself as a deep, profound
intellectual than the sugges-
tion that what he is attend-
ing is tantamount to a
“Beachboys” Concert?
Dylan is one of the inevit-
able casualties of our cul-
ture. We are just too big
and too complex to provide
the kinds of symbols that we
can identify with on a very
personal level. Instead, We

programs which are preparing students at ahigher level than many col-
lege freshman programs can accommodate.

The concept of a tutorial program and the use of both formal classes
and readings might alleviate some of the anti-intellectual flavor ‘many pro-
fessors feel is perpetuated by the reliance on “a grading system.”

Certainly the creation of the Committee on Instructional Technology
and Dr. Peake’s proposals cannot serve as a panacea for all academic prob-
lems. But the Peake-perspective "and efforts generated by such thinking
are necessary for the progress of higher education. They represent the
embryonic stage in a far-reaching revised academic outlook. We urge the
support and encouragement of this perspective at all levels in the

Senior Don Hahnfeldt
Finishes Swim Career
At Collegiate Nationals

Diver Don Hahnfeldt, an ar-
tist on the high board, competed
in the NCAA Championships at
the Air Force Academy last Sat-
urday. ’ '

(Hahnfeldt, a senior, perform-
ed on the one-meter and the
three-meter board but he and
swimming coach Ben Grady did
not return until early this morn-
ing and the ﬁnal results were
not available at press time-)

With his appearance in the
NCAA Championships, Hahnfeldt
ends a career which began at
Gateway High. And for Hahn-
feldt, the hours of practice and
the pressures of competition have
never been chores.

“Throughout my short career,
diving never has been work for
me,” Hahnfeldt said. “I always
said when it did become work, I
would quit,

“In this sport, I feel the only
work is done by the swimmers
who must swim great distances
every day,” he continued. “For
me diving is an enjoyable sport
and sometimes during the sum-
mer months, I give exhibitions
for small groups.”

Back on March 12, Hahnfeldt
competed in the Eastems at Navy
and for him this was supposed to
be it. “I thought the Eastern meet
was going to be my ﬁnal one,”
Hahnfeldt said. “The coach told
me to keep working out, how-
ever, and so I kept loose.”

In two weeks, the AAU swim-
ming meet will be held at Tam-
pa, Florida, but Hahnfeldt does
not plan to participate.

DON HAHNFELDT, diver and co-

captain :._ of‘ the swimming team,

demonstrates the style which

brought him Eastern and NCAA
honors.

Clair Riley Bows Early
In NCAA Tournament

Clair Riley closed out his wrestling career this past
weekend at the NCAA tournament at Iowa State, but the
way it ended was anti—climatic in comparison with his run-

ner-up finish in the Easterns

The senior 152-pounder was
pinned in the third period of his
second round match with Wayne
Wells of Oklahoma. Wells, the
top seeded wrestler in that
weight division, was leading at
the time, 12-7. Wells was later
upset by Jim Kamsen of Michi-
gan, depriving Riley of the chance
to work his way up in the con-
solation matches.

Before the tournament Riley
said his performance would de-
pend to a great extent on the
bracket he was placed in.

Riley disagrees. “To be truth-
ful, the seeding was the best I
could have drawn. If I had gotten
past Wells, I could have gone
far. I was surprised when he was
beaten later on because I thought
for sure he.’d make the ﬁnals and
thereby guarantee me a. spot in
the consolations.”

Before leaving for-Iowa State,
Riley's coach, Dave Johnson,
summed up Ri1ey’s wrestling abil-
ity the best way possible. “I don’t
know how Cl__air will do,” John-
son said, “but I know this, he’ll
try his hardest because that's the
only way he knows how to wres-
tle.”

V’ dent Programs: While some work
_ would be taken in formal classes,
I some work would be through f0I‘"
,mal readings with appropriate

guidance preparatory to achieve-

ment examinations. Other work
I. would include individualized pro-
 grammed learning, again looking
toward achievement examina-
 tions.

> 3) New Technologies. Where-
ever possible, new technological

’devices which would facilitate

individual learning would be em-

' ployed. In ﬁelds such as elemen-
, tary language ‘instruction, pro-

grammed learning can be used.
For many students, the con-
ventional class in elementary in-
struction its conventional grad-
ing system would give way to a

' tutorial role divorced from the
grading system. The purpose here

is to permit each student to set
his own pace in reaching a speci-
ﬁc level of competence.

Dr. Norman Mulgrave, assis-
tant dean of the School of Liber-
al Arts, will chair the. commit-

’ tee. Members of the steering com-

mittee are Dr. Robert Glaser, di-

' rector of the Learning Research

and Development Center, and Dr.
Walter Stone, director of the Uni-

5 '_ versity libraries.

mittee are Dr. Charles Cullen,

ment; Dr. Carl Beck, political sci-
ence department; Dr. Alan An-

Re—write the books!

There’s a change in curriculum. Toronado’s in! Front wheel drive with 385—horse

Rocket V-8 takes boredom out of the course! No more cramming-‘—with ﬂat ﬂoors, six passengers
are a snap! Toronado styling takes honors over anything else on the road! In fact . . .

sample the style and action of any of the Toronado-inspired Rocket Action’ Oldsmobiles.

You’ll want to major in Olds ownership! LOOK TO OLDS FOR THE NEW!
