Food Main Topic

By AL JANEZIC

Food was the main topic of

‘conversation for 70 minutes of the

80-minute Men’s _Dorm Council
dinner-meeting Wednesday eve-
ning in Tower A cefeteria.
Special guest Phil Bach, director
of the Towers’ SAGA food service,
answered questions ranging from

Schedule Clash

Ruins Plans

Of Frosh Camp

Freshman Camp for 1964 has
been cancelled due to a schedule
conﬂict, according to Men’s Coun-
cil President Leonard Schwartz.

The camp was originally set
forthe weekend of Sept. 11-13
but the ﬁrst football game of
the season falls on the Saturday
of the weekend, necessitating
cancellation of the outing. No al-
ternate date is available, accord-
ing to Schwartz.

“Freshman Camp in, no way
is dead,” said Schwartz, “but it
just can’t be held this year.”

‘Men’s Council traditionally han-

dles all details of planning for
the event which is the initial
University outing for incoming
freshmen men. The weekend con-
sists of various athletic events
with the freshmen divided into
teams, giving them their ﬁrst
taste of the University esprit d’

corps. .

Schwartz also announced that

Vpositions are still open for up-

perclass counseling, Transfer Day,
Activities Fair, freshman council,
and Men’s Council steering com-
mittee. Interested parties should
contact Schwartz either at 683-
4933 or through the Dean of
Men’s Office, 502 SU.

At MDC Meeting

dirty spoons to illegal cafeteria
entrance.

Bach said a major reason "for
many of the dissatisfactions was
a personnel problem. He noted

that in the past two weeks 23 em-
ployees, mostly students, have left
the Service because of school work
and other problems,’ and added
that it takes time for the new
help to get acquainted with the
system.

With grace and congeniality
throughout, Bach stressed that
“we want people that give cour-
teous service and would certain-
ly appreciate the name or de-
scription of any discourteous
personnel.”

In other business, Hawthorne
House was declared “definitely in
the running and won’t be disquali-
ﬁed” from the Best Unit Living
Award competition. In making th'e
announcement, Dave ‘ Higbee, vice
president, added that the decision
onthe future status of Hawthorne
House will be made by the new
Dorm Council which -officially
takes over at tonight’s MDC ban-
quet. V

A complaint that a house other
than Hawthorne received extra
money was denied, President Pete
Bijur said: “Neither the treasurer,
advisor, director or president
knows anything about it.” ‘

Advisor John Bender inform-
ed Council that no more 100-
watt light bulbs wil be pro-
vided for house lounges because
of ‘excessive theft and stated
that if damage to the furniture
continues, “additional requests
’ (for furniture) will be question-
ed.”

MDC is sponsoring a talk by
District Attorney Robert W. Dug-
gan tomorrow in Tower A lobby
at 7:30 p.m. He will deal with
crime and corruption in Allegheny
County. His talk is open to the
public.

At Carnegie Music Hall

Spring Concert Friday

The University’s 65-piece Concert Band presents its annual Spring‘
Concert Friday, 8:15 p.m. in Carnegie Music Hall. Musical selections .

range from the old favorites, “Golden Eagle March” by Walters and
“The Stars and Stripes Forever,” by Sousa to Azzo1ina’s “New York
Suite,” published eight weeks ago. i

The “New York Suite” will feature a piano solo by Rhea Rose,
one of 13 girls in the Concert Band. Other highlights include Kepner’s
“El'Tempesto,” a trumpet solo by Glenn W. Prager, a clarinet duo,
K1ing’s “The Two Little Bullﬁnches,” by Edward Johnston and G.
Timothy Anderson, and the trombone trio of E.‘Rudolf Dorsch, Wil-
liam Koenemund‘ and Frederick Burkhart, with their rendition of
Butts’ “Swinging Slides.”

Student Composition

Another highlight of the program is an original composition by a
University student, Larry Bernfeld‘, entitled, “lnvention for Wood-
winds.” The woodwind sextet which will perform the work includes:
[Carol Knepshield, ﬂute; Ed Johnston, B ﬂat clarinet I;- Ralph Wilps,
B ﬂat clarinet II; Allen Popsack, alto clarinet; Barry Krikstone, bas-
soon, and Bernfeld, bass clarinet.

The band recently returned from its annual concert tour
where it presented seven concerts in two days in Erie high
schools, and at the Bradford and Johnstown regional campuses.

In a review of the concert presented at Bradford, which is the
same one to, be presented here Friday night, the B’I‘¢ldf0’l‘d Era said:
“This talented and beautifully disciplined band seemed "completely
at home in the full scope of a demanding program . . .”

Tickets for the concert, at one dollar each, are available at the

SU,'CL and Tower desks. They may also be, obtained from band-

members or at the door. A special half—price rate is offered for

Effective, Respected   SC Listed

As Administratiorfs Goals - - Vrana

By MARGIE DONALDSON

Newly elected Student Govern-
ment President John Vrana stated
at the S.G. banquet last Thurs-
day that the goal of his admini-
stration is to work for an effective.
and respected student government.

“To reach this goal, I believe
that two things are necessary,”
Vrana said."“We, the new Senate
and executive branch of Student
Government, V must be responsible.
Second, we ,must unite and coop-
erate with.other student leaders
and other student organizations in
order to solve problems that affect
the general interest of the student
body." . ,

In explaining the responsibili-
ties of the executive branch,
Vrana continued, “both Ron Ci-
mino (vice-president) and I are
willing to be sensitive to the
needs and problemsiof the stu-
dent body, to go into any office
in this University, faculty and
administration, and discuss “stu-

. dent problems, and to work for
the solution of them by the most
practical means available, al- ‘

of student unity and cooperation.
“I have always believed that if
any problem is to be solved suc-
cessfully in this University, the
students must be united. Because
there is strength in unity, the
efforts of ten student leaders and
ten campus organizations will al-
ways far outshadow the lone ef-
forts of one organization, even if
this lone organization is a strong
student government.” .
Awards Presented .
Senators Jack Koury, Ben Car-
din, and Beverly Reifman received
awards for their worthwhile con-
tributions to student government.
Cabinet members Harriet Hersh
and Rich Minker were also given
awards for their outstanding work.

As a remembrance of her year
as vice-president, Gussie Smith
was presented with her gavel.

Outgoing President Martin
Landy summed up his .year in
ofﬁce. “We can be satisﬁed with
what was done, but we must re-
member we could have done more.
With every accomplishment, we
should always look forward. I am
gratiﬁed at this year.” ‘ .

V r a n a announced V Studen
Government Committee Chair-
men for next year. James Smith
is Homecoming Chairman; Janet
_McKeever, Freshman Outing
Chairman, and Steve Stillman,
Parents’ Week-end Chairman.

“Anyone interested in working
on these committees should con-
tact the chairmen,” added Vrana.

champion of civil rights on

_award along the way.

In,1947, the President’s Com-
mission on Higher Education an-
nounced: “Forty-nine percent of’
our population has the mental

- . ability to complete fourteen years
- of schooling in

general and V0-
' cational studies
that should lead
either to gain-
. ful employment
‘ or further study
at a more ad-
vanced level.” .
The National 3
Inventory:
of Talent devis-
ed by that com-
,-mission has been echoed by en-
suing Presidential commissions de-
signed to investigate the country’s
discovery and training of human
talent. For ideal equality of op-
portunity to exist, the educational
_ system must be capable of proper-
ly training and motivating all
those students who can proﬁt from
higher education. It follows that
g the ‘degree of efficiency achieved
in the process can be measured by
the success with which colleges
enroll qualiﬁed people with little
"or no talent loss.

At the bottom end of the con-
tinuum of opportunity is the
two-year extension college. This
institutional approach is the
least successful in attracting all '
students who can‘ profit from
two-years of higher education.
Several inherent features of the
two-year extension colege cause
this to be true. Initially, the cur-

. riculum offering of the extension
is." as narrow or narrower than
the four-year institution that
supports it. (Not that four-year
institutions are “narrow” in cur-
riculum offering, rather narrow
in terms of all the diverse kinds
of‘offerings that an educational

' system can embody.)

Obviously, the nature of the

' curriculum makes additional edu-

cation. impractical for students

who have the mental ability _to

i_ vf‘pI‘Oﬁt from two years of education

after high school, but want voca-
tional—technical training, clerical
education, or general education
for employment purposes. Fur-

. thermore, the cost of attendance at

extension schools is the same as
or near the cost of attendance at
the parent institution. In many
cases, this also restricts the oppor-
tunity for students to obtain _a
higher education.

More often than not, the exten-

1 sion college, for ideological rea-
sons, is stand-offish from the per-

sonality of the community. This
separation represents a‘ severe re-
striction of the opportunity offer-
ed by the institution as we shall
see later.

All in all, the two-year ex-
‘. tension college is less success-
’ , ful than other forms of two-year
’ institutions in providing, educa-

It was natural, therefore, that when the ad—hoc anti-discrimination

' group was formed last April, Freda was one of the driving forces in
the infant organization. ‘From there she went on to form the Hill Educa-

tional opportunity. But this can-
not he a criticism of two-year
extension colleges, for ideologi-
cal factors enter into the raison
d’etre of the extension school.
Like the unfair criticism to
which Dr. Eddy subjected the
community college (as they ex-
ist in the stricter sense of pub-
lic tuition-free colleges), one
must see that the extension
school is not meant to provide
complete diversity of opportu-

demand. I »

’ The two-year extension’ school is
an extension of the philosopsy of
the ' institution that maintains it.
Because these parent institutions
‘interpret. higher education more
strictly (as does Dr. Eddy), the

extension colege is designed to

offer only the same kind of op-
portunity as the supporting uni‘-

versity. _ V

It can be concluded that the ex-
tension .college is not an attempt
to offer diverse opportunity to all
people, but an attempt to offer
thesame opportunity as the _parent
school to more people. This is en-

entirely justiﬁable within th e

philosophical fabric of higher edu-

cation, as long as the institution is

a private one. 0

The private junior college

.(like Point Park and Robert
Morris) suffers from much the
same malady as the extension
school. The philosophy of the
institution is less restrictive and
the institution less stand-offish
because of the nature of the
clientele the college must serve.
The private junior college is.
still designed to offer only pre-
paration for four years of study
with some emphasis on the more
“practical” segments of the cur-
riculum such as business
clerical courses. *

The two-year terminal curricu-

lum is not a major emphasis as it
is not in the extension school. Cost
is somewhat lower to the student,
but the junior college still cannot
approach the ideal. Because the
junior college offers slightly more
curriculum offering, educational
opportunity is expanded. Lower
cost and a more community-ori-
ented philosophy place the junior
college higher on the continuum
than the extension school.

The public junior college repre-
sents the ﬁrst institution under
discussion that is designed and
operated as an extension of public
policy. The mere governmental at-
tachment of this institution is in-
dicative of its philosophy: it. is
almost entirely integrated with the
personality of the community and
reflects the ideals, and aspirations
of the population it serves. '

. The image the town folk have
of the jublic junior college is
radically. different than that of
the private junior college and
the extension school. This image
accounts for the . individual’s_

nity as the ideal form would -

and .

Now, ﬁetla ,
Freda Kellams has made a name for herself in this institution.
She ﬁrst-shot into prominence over a year ago when The Pitt N ews print-
ed a letter from her in our now defunct Mosaic column, in which she
attacked those students who looked with disdain upon mixed dating be-

tween white girls and Negro boys. The letter created much discussion and
Freda arose out of the controversy which followed as the unchallenged

. By Jim Joseph
perception of the opportunity
available to ‘him and can repre-
sent , a signiﬁcant obstacle to
higher ’ education if it is the
wrong image for the community
to identifywith. V

The community- college is the
ideal institution as measured _by
availability of opportunity. It is
superior to the other two-year
institutions. in all respects. The
community college possesses the
personality of the entire commu-
nity, is tuition-free, and has the

widest curriculum offering of all ~

institutions. As long as the gov-
ernment is going to toy with high-
er education, this is the most
meaningful form their activities
can take. 0 ‘

b Dr. Eddy denies this also, main-
taining that government action

‘should take the form of scholar-

ships so that all students might
take advantageof the “genuine”
education available . at residential
colleges. But Dr. Eddy ignores
certain of the facts. The‘ number

of students who can profit from‘

higher education is contingent
upon (1) the nature of the oppor-
tunity available, and (2) in what
combinations and arrangements it
is offered. In a word, students
must perceive higher education as
a practical goal before they can
be induced into any form of edu-
cation by scholarships.
This perception of higher edu-
cation is determined by the de-
velopment status of the indivi-'
-dual, his family situation, pa-
rental attitudes, peer group as-
sociations, and past educational
experience. A student who wants
a clerical or technical education,
who wants to live at home, who
wants to sacriﬁce his earning _
power for two years only, will
not perceive the University of
‘Pittsburgh, Chatham College, or
Carnegie Tech as an opportunity
because his perception of an op-
portunity will not coincide with
the type of opportunity avail-
able. n
Thus, Dr. Eddy presumes that
all students want a four-year
residential education and assumes
that their only obstacle is a ﬁnan-
cial.one. But we have seen how
the ﬁnancial problem is not pri-
mary, rather the perception of op-
portunity is the main factor. A
demand for scholarships to induce

these students to attend college.

ignores the proper interpretation
of equality of opportunity and
places Dr. Eddy in the old school
where equality of opportunity
meant equal exposure to the same
type of education. Moreover, the
scholarship program would repre-
sent a government attempt to in-
duce students to take advantage
of the same kind of opportunity
and introduce parochialism of the
worst kind. Clearly, Dr. Eddy’s
demands are dangerous‘ and un-

founded... g

Freda called her protest a “passive, non—violent resistance,” and
emphasized that she was picketing as an individual and that her actions
were in no way connected with the University. .

, Oh! come now, Freda, let’s look at things rationallyvfor once.
Everybody knows that you’ve had letters printed in The Pitt New, and
that you’re a graduate of the University, and that you work in Schenley
Hall for HEP and nothing you can say about “picketing as an individual”
will do one little bit to convince people that this institution isn’t ‘backing
you to the hilt. You act as if Pittsburgh is Birmingham and things like
unfair hiring practices can’t be handled in any other manner than by‘
your sitting down in front of a truck -and having yourself ingloriously
toted off to jail. Situations of this type in this town can be handled in

a more digniﬁed manner. We have a very efficient Human Relations
Commission here and they can do a job just as well as you and quite ‘
a bit neater to boot. All you’ve done is to bring discredit upon yourself,
your institution, and upon ‘HEP. In the future we would advise you to
be a bit more careful aboutyour choice of seating accommodations. You
V may be sitting on others and gaining nothing for your effort.

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

One of the lesser known movie makers in-Italy is a
young man named Dino Risi. He has done work in the
shadow of the giants, Antonioni, Fellini, De Sica and Visconti,
and has waited for an opportunity to spring loose his talents
on.the motion picture world. Now to our shores has come
“The Easy Life,” his ﬁrst major ﬁlm effort and one of the
best comedies to appear in this country during the pas
season. I

“The Easy Life” stars Vittorio Gassman and Jean-Loui_s
Trintegent in a black-and-white—with-subtitles creation about
a free-wheeling, aloof forty-ish rebel who charms a young
law student into joining him for a holiday joy ride "through
the Italian countryside. This is by no means a D'on-Quixote-
Sancho Panza relationship, but it is the corruption of the
youthful innocence by the worldly irresponsible. Gassman is
marvelous as the I-don’t-give-a-damn-type who drives his
sports carsas though each mile was going to be his last. Since

. Mr. Gassman returned to his native Italy to make-ﬁlms and

dismissed his unhappy movie experiences in the United
States, there has been a wonderful rebirth of acting talent
from this ﬁne actor and comedian. ‘
Confused Law Student

As the confused and naive law student, Trintegent gives
a ﬁne low-keyed performance, while letting Gassman gain
the major acting laurels. Trintegent was heretofore only
known as a co-star and ‘bed-mate_of Brigitte Bardot. In “The
Easy Life,” hedisplays a— very skillful portrayal and should
gain fame as an actor and not as a lover of fading sexpots.
' Men of the Road , _
The two characters follow the highways and come across

imany assorted characters and situations. They are respon-

sible for a couple of crazy car accidents. They fool around
with a group of ﬂirts. They spend some time with Gassman’s
18-year-old daughter, her middle-aged ﬁancee, and Gassman’s
estranged wife. The youth is awed by the way Gassman‘
lives and soon he is trying to emulate his idol. The ﬁlm ends
on a note of stark tragedy as the young man is killed in an
auto crash. The end comes so suddenly that the audience is

~ totally unprepared. What has been a delightful comedy now

becomes a mysterious tragedy and the after effects of the

’ ﬁlm are diﬁicult to describe.

Director Risi emerges from the background of, Italian
ﬁlms to the foreground with this very ﬁne movie. It- is funny,
sardonic, touching, and sad- The director-writer shows us a
slice of life that runsithe gamut from family, religion and
conformity ‘to the. individual, atheism, and non-conformity.
Except for the strange ending, “The Easy Life.” is very funny
and as carefree as Mr. Gassman and his sports car. Don’-t miss
this one!

LA Cabinet
Evaluates ‘80’
Series Classes

Liberal Arts Cabinet has com-
piled an evaluation of the 80’s
courses offered at the University.

The survey shows that Classics
81, English 80 and 81, Fine ‘Arts
80, German 80, History 81, Inter-
discipline 81 and 85, Music 80,
and Speech 81 are the most val-
uable distribution courses in the
eyes of the students polled.

The data was collected from
students taking 80’s courses dur-
ing fall trimester and the results
were released to Dean of Liberal
Arts Albert B. Martin, heads of
Divisions of Humanities, Social
science and Natural Science and
to teachers who expressed desire
to -see the results.

Tom Zaret, a member of the
Cabinet, said the cabinet is work-
ing closely with the administra-
tion and hopes to act as liaison
between students and teachers.
The cabinet hopes to expand its
Work during the spring term and
have a more meaningful report
in the future.

“Students who have complaints
about the 80 courses may submit
them in writing for the cabinet’s
consideration at SU desk. All
letters must be ‘signed but stu-
dent’s -names will not be dis-
closed,” Zaret said.

Freshmen Look Good

Football Practice At Slow Pace

"By BILL CABIN

With the football squad
at the midwaymark in its
20 day spring practice,
coach John Michelosen feels
the practice is going slower than
last year. Michelosen said, “We
are going about it differently.
this year, because we have
many new boys.” ’.
According to Michelosen, the
squad is not large enough to.

be practicing in offensive and '

defensive platoons. Instead,
fundamentals, such as the exe-
cution of basic plays and the
development of agility, are being
stressed. If the players learn to
execute the fundamentals now,
Michelosen feels that they will
_be ready for platoon work in
August.

Although he is not stressing
strictly offensive and defensive
playing, Michelosen said, “We
hope eventually to develop of-
fensive and defensive special-
ists.” . .
Michelosen said that although
many players have no varsity
experience, they are “working
well and showing a lot of en-
thusiasm.” »He is particularly

r pleased with several promising

freshmen, who may compensate -
forlsome of the present weak
spots in the lineup.

“We have our most experi-
ence at center with four men
from last year’s squad, but we’re
short on experience ‘at end and
tackle,” said Michelosen. The
four centers are Marty Schott-
enheimer, Paul Cercel, Fred
Hoa-glin, and Jock Beachler.

The most promising freshman
prospect at end is Mike Rosbor-
ough of Donora. He will be
competing with lettermen Bill
Howley and John Verkleeren,
and sophomores Phil Dahar and
Mitch Zalnasky for a starting
position.

Michelosen said, “Brian Gen-
eralovich is trying hard and
could be of some assistance to
the team.” According to Mich-
elosen, Generalovich, who has
been practicing at end, “so far

' has been playing better on de-

fense than on offense.” Helsnaid,
“Generalovich is a strong boy,

but still needs ,more practice.” ~

At tackle, freshmen prospects
Al Kaiser and Ed Schmidt offer
competition to returning letter-
men Jim Jones and Ron Lina-
berg. Dennis Bernick and Tom
Raymond, both of whom are
sophomores, will also be vying
for a starting position. V

Michelosen called Tom Qua-
ley the most promising fresh-

man -guard,“ but he will be com- '

peting with four lettermen.
Jim Flannigan, ,a freshman

from iWest 'Mifﬂin North, shows
good potential at fullback, and
Michelosen said that Ed James,
Pete Smith, and Jim Pohl are
promising prospects at quarter-
back. V _

Michelosen _was reluctant to
compare this ‘squad to last year’s
team, because it is still too early
for such an evaluation". He said,
however, “The main thing is
that the players learn what
their capabilities are, and know
how to _execute the fundamen-
tals, so they can be ready in
September.”

 

Levine, Hahnfeldt Eliminated Early

Swimmers Fail in NCAA Meet

By HOWARD AINISMAN
The Panthers’ Rob Levine and Don Hahn-

Levine failed to qualify after the first heat in
the 100 and 200-yard backstroke and Hahnfeldt

diving events. Ron Levine, who was to swim
the 100-yard butterﬂy, could not go because

his studies were pressing.

In the championships every NCAA and meet

Shoulder Injury Costs

Mike Johnson Chance

For NCAA

Mat Title

Wrestling coach Rex Peery hesitated to alibi for Mike
Johnson’s poor showing in’ the NCAA championships last
weekend, but a teammate of Johnson’s said there was little

doubtthat the injury cost Johnson his ﬁrst round match to .

eventual runner-up Jim Hanson of Colorado.

“There’s little doubt the injury cost Mike,” the wrestler said, “He
just couldn’t do anything with that arm.” Johnson injured his shoulder
while winning the Eastern championship. The injury bothered John-
son enough that he had to forfeit his ﬁrst consolation match.

Johnson’s performance was typical of the showingmade by the
entire Panther team. Tom Baily, Frank O’Korn and Ken Barr made
the furthest advance of any of .the Panthers, but all lost in the

quarter-ﬁnals.

O’Korn lost in the 137-pound division to Jim Rogers of Oklahoma
State. Rogers went on to ﬁnish ﬁfth, Baily lost to Jeff Stephens of
Cornell, 8-3, and Barr lost a unanimous refere‘e"s decision to Marshall
Dauberman of Maryland. The match was scoreless after regulation

time and 1-1 after the overtime.

Baily made about the best showing of any of the Panthers by
defeating Rahim J avanmard of UCLA, 5-2. J avanmard ﬁnished fourth

year.

Duff Killian and Lee Hall. reached the second ‘round for the

Panthers. Killian drew a ﬁrst round bye before losing to Mike Beery
of Ohio State, 5-2, in the 115-pound class, while Hall won his first
match before losing to Tom Peckham of Iowa State, 3-1.

, Tom Heniff, Dino Boni and Bill Beck all lost their ﬁrst round

matches.

Oklahoma State set an NCAA record in winning the ‘team title
with “86 points. Iowa State "was second and Oklahoma third. The
Panthers scored only eight points, for one of their worst showings

in many years.

The- individual winners from 115-pounds to heavyweight, re-
spectively, were Terry Finn of Southern Illinois, Fred Powell of
Lock‘ Haven, Yojiro Uetake of Oklahoma State, Mike Sager of Okla-
homa, Jerry..Sta_nley—of Oklahoma, Gordon Hassrnan of Iowa" State,

The failure of one Eastern wrestler to win an [individual title.

was a complete contrast to last year, when the East won four ‘titles,
and showed the weakness of Eastern wrestling this year. The best
showing made by a-n Eastern wrestler was Dick Slutzky of Syracuse,
who took a second in a 157-pound class. .

Besides Johnson’s major upset loss, the East’s other big hope
for an NCAA title, Jim Nance, was also beaten in" a major upset.
Nance, a favorite to cop his second straight title, was beaten in the
quarter-finals by Bob Billberg of Moorhead State, 2-1.

Snow Covers Field

VVeather Forces Ball
Club into Field House

Snow forced the ‘ baseball" team into Fitzgerald Field
House Monday for the ﬁrst timein two weeks, -putting a‘
crimp in coach Bobby Lewis’s plans to have his starting nine
determined by next ‘week. —

The baseball team now has to return to hitting in the batting
cages, and drilling on the fundamentals. “We’ll practice game situa-_
tions for the next few days,” Lewis said. The team will practice run-
downs, pick-offs, and other basic _plays of the game during its stay
in the Field House.

Last Saturday thebaseball team held an intra-squad game be-
tween the Mazurek Marauders and the Fisher Flashes. The Marauders
won the seven inning contest, 9-8."

Lewis was pleased with the hitting display, thought to bean ap-
parent weakness on the team. “Our hitting seems to be picking up,”
he said. “We’re starting to come along now.

“You don’t need a lot of hits to win a college baseball game,”
Lewis continued. “Just give me one hit per player per game and we’ll
‘win our share. Errors and “walks will make up the rest of the runs
we need.”

'Lewis is forced to admit, however,‘ that he might have trouble
getting his- one hit per player per game. “Right now we have four
strong hitters in Fred Mazurek, Barry Wetzel, Doug Chambers, and
Brian Fisher. But you can’t expect them to carry the team.”

Lewis is. counting on so\phomoI-es to carry the rest of the hitting
load. ‘_‘We have four or ﬁve fellows on this team who havcn’t played
in a college game yet who I’m counting on to hit. But I can’t be sure
of them.”

_ The four ballplayers_ Lewis referred to » are second baseman
George Prussin, shortstop Larry Szykowny, third baseman Dave

Reichenbach, and pitcher-inﬁelder Steve Eiseman. For the team to ’

have a good season, Lewis thinks two or three of them must have

strong years. . A . _ V .
Lewis hopes to have a strong hitting outﬁeld this year -with Fred

Mazurek in center ﬁeld, Barry Wetzel in left ﬁeld, and a strong hitter

in right ﬁeld. “I’m still not sure who we’ll use in right ﬁeld,” Lewis ‘

said. “It depends on who does the most hitting. I might move Jim
Yedlicka out there, or I might; use John Cullen or Tim Grgurich. The
player who shows the most hitting willget the position.”
