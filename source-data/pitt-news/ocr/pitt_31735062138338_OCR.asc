‘ The following letteris addressed to
the Women students of the University
by . the Women’s Self-Government
Committee; . ‘ ' .V

Within a ‘very short while therewill
be submitted Vto»theLgirls of the Uni-‘
versity for theirapproval or disap'-pro-‘
val, a plan for women's self govern-
ment. This will in no way negate _or
interfere with the tudent Senate. But
it will'dea1'with problems that are pe-
culiarly women-’s problems, and that
have not been -considered heretofore.

,Within the last few years the co-
edsin the University have increased
tremendously, in numbers. ' So far as
the writercan sense there isn’t among
them a spirit of unity and oneness
that there shouldbe among a group
of "seven ‘hundred college women, In
every co-educational institution Worth
its mention, there is separate student
government for the men and. women.
At Ohio Wesleyan, Syracuse, S'wartl1-
more, Dickinson, Oberlin, Allegheny,
Bucknell, and many "other co—educa.-
tional universities theyhave found it
proﬁtable and beneﬁcial for the two
groups to have separate student self-
government; Perhaps that is therea-
son why every school east of the Miss-
issippi worth its salt was represented
at the annual conference of the Wom-
en's lntercollegiate- Association for

lege. The University of Pittsburgh
was permitted to send one jvisiting,
delegate only, because the women here
did not have women's self-govern-‘
m‘ent,..and could not become a. mem-
ber of the association. ’ 

'-In no group whose one eleVment‘iVs

it speaks ‘V as individual ‘voices. For

No doubtthere. willibe a. new form
of sport at Pitt in thenext few years.
Perhaps airplanes, with colors ,of Blue‘
and Gold, will ﬂy over " the school,
while" studentsfon the campus, will
stand with necks -strained ‘watching
the antics of Pitt ﬂyers. It will be" a.
favorite pastime for students to sit
on 'StaVte‘I-Iall steps and look skyward,
or_ to cut a class inorder to take
some fair co-ed for a spin through the
fresh and balmy atmosphere; ‘ . '

Tentative plans are now‘ under way
.to form an Aero _VClub,, composed of
ex-service airmen. The name of the
organization will be the Aero‘ Club of
the’University of Pittsburgh, which,
no donbt, will be afﬁliated with the
Inter-Collegiate ‘Flying Assoc_ia.tion,
which is composed of the combined
aero clubs of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Columbia, Williams and Cornell
universities. .. ~

Atthe recent "meeting of the club,

Louis Dussere, who has been working
on the-interest of_the club, discussed

-theV primary features of such an or- .

ganization at Pitt. »He discussed the
plan of the Inter-Collegiate Flying As-
sociation to hold races at different‘
times in the year. Each school, ac-
cording to Dussere, will. enter-vtwo
ships in each event that is staged. ‘
Plans are now in formation, to hold
_a. race from New York to Boston and
return, May 7-and 8. The distance of
the race will be 600, miles,'Wi_th'six
stops permitted. At a luncheon last
_Thursday in ,the..-Schenley Hotel, a.
petition was read asking the Inter-
Collegiate Flying Association for a
Pitt membership in that organization.

were recently elected, are: President,

instructive of the _notes_ from for-

"the handwriting of F. S.‘ Miller of
jthe class of 1889. Rev. Miller writes
ﬁbrieﬂy and encloses an order for
$100, a most generous sum from far
._off_ Korea, the land of ‘famine and
- want. And yet Rev. Miller express-
"'es..his sorrow over the fact that he
.can’t send more. That is the ex-
;pression of true’ loyalty and gener-
__ ._os_ity. His letter follows: .

 Pray for Korea. .
. A _  A touch of local color is given to

:Rev. - Miller's communication in a.
 -short paragraph of an enclosed leaf-
. ﬁllet which tells of a. convention ‘of
_;4Korean missionaries. in which it was
_.j'd'ecided."‘to send‘ one Korean and
pjone American to the ‘Pan-Presbyte

The paragraph was ‘bue"pen.ci1ed ‘by
:3 Rev. .rMiller to call our attention -1 to
 ,-the fact" -that wherever men meet
  -Pittsburgh; seems -to ‘be in their
 , midst. ' ’
* ' ,_ Korean Missions. _
In his particular ﬁeld in Korea,
Dr. =.Mi1l_er reports. that the work of
_.the_ missionaries among the natives
.now shows that there a.re?817 elders,
;,-183 pastors, 66,411 baptized and 17,-
9713 catechumens-Koreans who believe
and practice the doctrines of~Chris-
,tianity. This result has _been attain-
: ed in the face of insistent. disease
. and famine which hasiadded innum-
erable hardships. to the work. _'
S A "A true picture of conditions in
Korea, of the differences‘ which
 ;Christianity has worked, is given in
‘f _y-this? '- quotation from Dr. Miller's pa.
' ~ per. on “Things Korean”-—
 ‘A “It was during the Indian famine
about twenty years ago. .A prince
ﬁof that land of famous jewelry and
A.fatAal poverty greeted a guest with
the question: _ ‘What would you enjoy
 doing ..to.d'ay? An elephant ride, a
‘f visit.‘ to our family treasury, or
.what?’: The treasury was chosen,
"for, the .«ﬂidnce’s hoard of jewelry
‘was’ noted; ‘The day was spent in
inspecting I necklaces and bracelets
'ant1‘..‘-‘c'aipes~ of. pearls and diamonds
held, together by almost invisible
-wires; ﬁnger-rings and toe-rings, gold
 ndj“-gea'ns,-A till the eye weariedA of
hem and allsernse of value wasef-
aced. . ~ ’ ,
p_~“As the guest was conv_eyed_back'*
-j-to the--palace, he looked‘ out "across

priii‘ce'sA subjects were stretching
forth ‘bony ‘fingers for what‘ little

them from: starvation, A‘ A

had the words’ The Owl, '07, in ver- -; _.

G. Herbert Mccracken, a. true per-
sonage at Pitt. We- do notknow what
his ﬁrst. initial, f‘G,'f’ stands for,._but
we suppose it must mean “Great.”.We
{will call him. Herb, for short. Herb is
20 years of age, and hails "from Se-
wickley, where during the years 1913-
1917 he wrapped himself-i wit-h,*glo_r_y.
He played right half "on the _ football
team -there for two years and was

.an'd"was —captain in his last year. He
played left ﬁeld on the baseball team
for ‘two years and he swam for two
years. _' He captained" the _',swimming
team during‘ his last year.-» Not so
bad,‘eh? Captain of three major sports
at__‘ onetime. But his glory was not
ended; he sought further laurels,- and
he "certainly did find them’, for on en-
t‘ering~.tlie School of Economics of the
University in 1917, he went out and

where he played half-back. .He_‘ swam
the ‘sprints ‘for _thei'Universit’y in 1917-
1918. .‘ I Then .car'ne‘ »the"~ football. season
of',«1919, with all its trials and tribula-
tions, for “Pop? Warner. “Pop” chose
to use Mccracken fwhere there ,was a

red, Herb was used‘ to almost ‘-‘every
position on the team. He played end,
half and . cjuarter-back, and then again
fullcback, and sure‘ enough he held all
these -positions down with the ability
of a. veteran at each post. After the
football season was over; he_c-ame out

as Pitt’s ‘roving guard, but an injury
received in the game. with" Rutgers
kept‘ him out for the balance of the
season. ’ His injured member is new
again .'in shape," and Herb is looking
towards baseball or track and we feel
conﬁdent that" he will make. everyone

_ Ralph ‘Victor Relsgen is hishname,
