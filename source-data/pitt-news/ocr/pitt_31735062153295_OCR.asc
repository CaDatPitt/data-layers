served as the first president. Since

"its formation in 1914 the club has had
_a rapid growth and now is made up
of 263 students attending Pitt, Tech
and Duquesne University. Although

“Will we succeed in our political
ambitions ?”
This is the question which more

day's annual elections have been ask-
ing themselves. Balloting began in
the various schools at 9:0 o'clock -this
morning and will continue until .5.
o’clock this afternoon. ‘

Oﬂitcers are being. elected by the

tcl-asses of 1922, 1923 and 1924.’ Each
school is selecting one athletic repre-
sentative. .'Pwo Senators are being
elected by each class of the schoolsi.
Three assistant cheerleaders will be
chosen. In addition, next year’s junior
class is choosing its Owl editors and
Owl -managers. Amendments to, the
Senate ‘Constitution are being voted
on. .
, To vote, students must pres'ent their
registration cards. In case a student
has lost his card, he must make an af-
ﬁdavit to verify his identity.

The committee that has been work-
ing on recommendations for the
amendment of the Student Govern-
ment Constitution with the purpose of
making it anlsrwer ina greater degree
the demands of the day" has presented
a list of amendments to the Senate for
action. Believing that the changes.
proposed are such as the students
earnestly desire, the‘; Senate has de-

provisions of the Constitution as it
will stand when amended, such elec-
tions to be valid provided the students
accept these changes. In case they
reject them or any of them the elec-
tions will stand subject to the consti-
tutidn as it will then remain.

The complete list of the candidates
approved last Saturday follows:

PRIIVES EIIUAI III THE  

The proud trophy and idol of the
Hi-Kockey clan, namely, the game
rooster, is still intact in spite of
rough tactics and , numerous raids
made upon it. Hi-Kockey pledges
-known as “bad eggs,” guarded the
cock on the campus during Wednes-
day morning. Three gallant Pitt co-
eds approached “Bad Eggs” Heckel
and Muir, who were oh guard and en-

gaged the unsuspecting youths in con-
versation.‘ They ﬁnally attempted to
run off with the Hi-Kockey idol, but
were frustrated by the guards. Tres-
ently several football men appeared,
but their tricks and strategy proved
futile. ' . _ 

:When “Fats” Gourley, one of the
“bad eggs,” had the chanticleer under
his arm, no one could get «it. - Herb
Stein (another “bad egg”) on guard
later, had considerable trouble in
keeping the cock. By noon the idol
of the Hi-Kockeys had"neither legs
nor tail, and all in all showed signs of
rough usage. Due to the gallant work
of the “bad eggs” and the Hi-Kockeys
themselves, the idol never ‘left their
possession. The following pledges or
.,“bad eggs” “crewed,” at noon, after all
had been assembled by the Hi-
Kockey alarni bell: Herb Stein, Herb
McCracken, Cullen Gourley, George
Moore, Frank ‘Shea, Clark Green, Wil-
liam Homet, Carl Kingsbury, Joe
Heckel, Jim Muir, Max Hanmim, Ains-
Worth and Hornickel. , I '

The Hi-Kockeys then adjourned to
the Hotel Schenley grill room, had
lunch, and elected ofﬁcers for the com-
ing year as follows: Clarence’ Smith,
Hi—Kockey; Russell J
Kockey; Jack Kleber, Jack-Kockey;
Cullen Gourley-,, Game-Kockey.

The club will hold a banquet in the

PITT RECEIVES
STATISTICAL
. APPARATUS 

University" Has Permanent
‘ Laboratory of Accounting
Consisting of $30,000 in
Devices and Charts

 

 

The Department of ‘Statistical Re

now quartered in Room 2, -State Hall,
is operating under the direction of Dr.
D. M: Marvin, assistantprofessor of
Social Economics. This new division

partment and it is planned to conduct
practical analysis of student activities

as well as a regular course in student
instruction. Through the eﬂorts S of
Dr. Marvin the University has a per-
manent laboratory of accounting con-
sisting of $30,000 in calculating ma-
chines, electrical card-index appli-
ances, protectographs, bookkeeping
machines and numerous other devices
and charts that will enable advance-d,
accounting student to apply the mod-
ern system of office management, to
their preparatory work ‘here. By fall
the Statistical Department will have
$100,000 in equipment, Dr. Marvin
said. The University is one of the
few institutions ‘that has been able to
conduct successful business along
this line. It appears that the work is
beyond the experimental stage as evi-
denced by the interest shown by stu-
dents and installation of additional ap-
paratus.

. This new project is made possible,
by several ﬁrms that have installed
machines: Todd Protectograph, El-
liott-Fisheri '~Bookkeeping Machine,
Wales Adding and Bookkeeping Ma.-
chine, Dictograph Products Corpora-
tion, Monroe Calculating Machine,
Burroughs Adding Machine and H01-
lerith Tabulating Machine. Numerous
-represented
soon. The War Department has post-
ed one of the largest’ blue-print charts
in existence which shows to the min-
utest the‘ -comrplete distribution of-
army supplies from theplans of the
West to the ﬁeld-kritchen. on, the
"Marne. Other’ charts and graphs: il-
lustrate, by; comparison, ﬁgures or
briefs, economic problems such as
cost of living, labor turnover, office
management, war costs, etc. The de-
partment oyvns a Tslide-rultel that will
compute and do the work that other-
wise, would necessitate a rule of the
old type 100 feet in length‘? The elec-
trical card-i_nde1§ and ﬁling machine
that occupies a corner of the room, ac-
cumulates data electrically. It is the
intention of the department, according
to Dr. Marvin,.to assist the School of’
Economics‘ in listing ‘complete data
about each student in the school for
immediate reference. Other research
work will be accomplished in diff,ére~nt,
fields, for example comparison of stu-
dent activities at Pitt with the activ-
ities of another! universities, the cost
of mantaining athletics: in regards to
thescholvastic value obtained thereby,
outline of the value of the extension
bureau and its subsidiary the bureau
of student employment. These» prob-
lems and many others will be graphed
and charted so that the averége stu-

, e com-

parisons and conclusions at a‘gl=ance.
The Saiboratory is open for the in-
spection of local merchants and busi-
ness men and interested students. Dr.
Marvin is being assisted in this ad-
vanced accounting work by Professors

Charles Reitell and Victor Bennett.

PLAY YOUR PART TODAY
More than 100 students‘ desirous of office have played their part
by having their names placed before the student body. It is now up
‘ to the students to perform their role at the annual’ elections being
held today. ‘
Upon the student b0dy’s ' ,
upon the percentage of students who participate in i , depends what
student government at Pitt will amount to during the coming year.
The power of the Student Senate, just as any other representative
body, rests primarily upon the number of persons who decide its
‘composition. There have been frequenminstahces at the University,
when only a small minority of the students in, certain schools have
taken part in the elections. In some schools senators have been
elected by a handful of students. If representatives to the Senate are
elected today by a minority, that body cannot be criticised‘ if its in-
terest iii school affairs should prove to be scant." It would merely re-
fleet student interest. _ 
To be a true governing body, the Senate needs student backing.
Student‘ support can be evidenced in no bettéer way than by the num-
, her of undergraduates who participate in its selection. The incoming
senathrs and class officers, whoever they may be, doubtlessly desire
to begin their termof office with an. impetus. No more impressive
impetus could greetthe elected senators and make them ready to
.assume their duties with vigor than one hundred per cent student
panticipation in today ’s elections.  ' M
