Mrs. R. Mitchell-
Uses Cather Story
In Record Article

Dr. Bowman, Mr. Moulton Write
Articles On Cathedral,
Government

 

An article written by Willa Cather

‘for a Pittsburgh paper a number of

years ago about Ethelbert Nevin is'in-
corporated in an article by Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, “Willa Cather at
Queen Anne’s Lodge,” that will ap-
pear in the Pittsburgh Record for
May and June scheduled to come out
Thursday.

Miss Cather’s story was written
while she was still a reporter for one
of the local papers and is about a
conversation she had with this lead-
ing American composer. At present
Miss Cather is one of the leading
American authors, and has received
world-wide acclaim for most of her
books. The latest of her books, “Ob-
scure Destinies,” is a series of char-
acter descriptions of many of her
early friends in the West. Mrs. Mitch-
ell as adviser on interior plans for
the Cathedral describes the proposed
Ethelbert Nevin Memorial room to
be constructed in the building.

Dr, John G, Bowman, Chancellor of

the University, writes this time an--

other story on the “Cathedral Living”
in which he tells the story of the
building and its meaning.

"Government and Economics” by
Harold G. Moulton, head of the Brook-
ings institution and speaker at last
Fe«bruary’s commencement, proves his
statement that there is a. historical
precedent for the current, trend to-
ward governmental control of busi-
ness.

The frontispiece drawing in this is
sue of the Record is by Ward Hunter
who created the Cathedral impres-
sions appearing in the brochure of

Dr_ Bowman, “The Cathedral Living.”

'A feature of the pictorial record
of the Alumni association will be the
pictures of officers of all official Pitt
-clubs. The other pictures on these
pages will he views of the completed
building,‘ especially those of the Com-
mons room.

The editor of the Record, Don F.
Saunders, discussed the present sit-
uation of the University, the affairs
of the Alumni association and other
matters of interest under the title of
Matters of Record of Events and
Eventualities. Under the heading of
News of the University, Miss Doris
Shaver of the Pittsburgh Record of-
ﬁce gives the present building situa-

tion of the University and its affiliat-
ed interests. as the Mellon Institute,
the Eye and Ear hospital and other
buildings. '

Employment, Payrolls Increase
S-l5 Per Cent According To Review

University Bureau Releases
Business Figures; l929
Used As Example

Employment ﬁgures more optimis-
tic than any released by the Univer-
sity bureau of business research in
many months were included in the
current issue of the Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review, monthly publication of
the bureau.

Total employment to the Pittsburgh
district increased 5.1 per cent from
February to March, and combined
payrolls of all ﬁrms increased 15.2
per cent, the Review pointed out.
Furthermore, almost all groups show-
ed gains in both employment and pay-
rolls, many of the increases being far
greater than seasonal.

The bureau’s all—ﬁrms employment
index stood at 78.6 (preliminary) in
March, and the all-ﬁrms payrolls in-
dex averaged 56.7, both indexes being
based on the average month of the
peak year 1929 as equal to 100.

One of the most outstanding things
pointed out by the current review was
the fact that there were more work-
ers employed (at least part of the
time) in March and their payrolls
were larger than in any month since
October, 1931. It went on to state
that during the past five years em-
,ployment,has increased between Feb-
ruary and March three times and de-
creased twice, while payrolls have in-
creased every year during that period.

Manufacturing employment in the
district gained 1.8 per cent from Feb-
ruary to March, and manufacturing
payrolls increased 14.1 per cent. In-
dications in other business magazines
pointed to the fact that the improve-
ment was general, the Review stated.
According to the bulletin issued by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadel-
phia the average of wage earners in-
creased 3.1 per cent, and factory pay-
rolls were 8 per cent larger through-

The United States bureau of labor
statistics reported that factory em-
ployment in the whole country was 4
per cent higher, and that factory pay-
rolls increased 6.9 per cent,

Since March of last year, when con-
ditions reached their lowest ebb, fac-
tory employment ha.s increased 30.4
per cent, and payrolls 61.5 per cent.

Especially encouraging was the re-
port that some groups employed more
workers in March than in any other
month for which the bureau has rec-
ords.

Payrolls still were below those of
the average month of 1929 despite
their recent spurts. However, the
cost of living is also considerably low-
er than in 1929, and consequently the
purchasing power of workers in the
district is somewhat higher than pay-
rolls indexes indicate, the bureau
magazine observed.

Man—hours worked in March gained
19.0, by far the largest February-
March gain in the past ﬁve years.
Among the more impressive manufac-
turing gains were an increase of 49.8
per cent in the non-ferrous metals
group, an increase of 43.3 per cent in
the foundry and machine shop group,
and an increase of 24.6 per cent in
the iron and steel products group
(exclusive of machinery.)

Total man hours worked by wage-
earners in the first quarter were al-
most 44 per cent above the total in
the ﬁrst quarter last year, said the
Review, and substantial gains were
also reported by railroads and public
utilities.

Delegates Draw

Up 'Const‘itut-ion

 

Students Of 33 Schools Rewrite
State Body Of Laws

Thirty-three colleges and universi-
ties of Pennsylvania gave a rising
vote of thanks and commendation to
students of the University for their
efforts in building up the ﬁrst state
wide intercollegiate conference on
government problems at Harrisburg
last week.

This ﬁrst conference of which John
P. Bracken, C34, was state chairman,
and Genevieve Blatt, C33, was vice
chairman, drafted a model constitu-
tion for the state. Besides drawing
up the new constitution the delegates
agreed to set up a temporary state
committee to continue the yearly in-
tercollegiate conference on govern-
mental problems. The University stu-
dent appointed to the state committee
is. Vvinston Mcconkey, C35, Miss
Blatt and Bracken were appointed by
the convention to draw up tentative
plans for next year’s conference. It
was agreed, with some reservations,
that the coming conference would be
centered on loca.l government.

Signiﬁcant sections of the new
model constitution whose ﬁnal draft-
ing was done by Pitt students are:
1, The legislature: a one—house body
of about 100 members, ten of whom
are to be elected by the Hare system
of proportional representation from
each of the ten legislative districts.
These districts to be set up by the
legislature will follow economic and
metropolitan lines. The legislature
was given wide discretionary powers.
2,‘ The governor: to appoint all depart-
ment heads; to be allowed to sit in
legislature but not to vote; must pre-
sent a complete budget and be re-
sponsible for it. All elected public
oﬂicials may be recalled by the peo-
ple. 3. The judiciary: the supreme
court judges to be appointed by the
governor, other judges to be appointed
by a. judicial council made up of the
governor. the supreme court judges
and three members of the Pennsylva-
nia Bar association; the court shall
have very little power to declare leg-
islative acts unconstitutional. 4.
Elections: regulated by state govern-
ment which shall provide for pennan-
eiit registration, no tax qualiﬁcations,
and absent voting throughout the
state. 5. The Legislature: given wide
taxing powers, shall not be restricted
by anything except the Federal con-
stitution. All appropriations to be
made by and regulated by, a state
budget commission. 6. Social legisla-
tion: state to have power to assure
adequate food, clothing, shelter, and
medical care to all citizens. State
shall not pass laws forbidding or forc-
ing any union organization of work-
ers. All public education to be under
the control of and at least half ﬁnan-

ced by the state department of public

instruction. 7. County and local gov-
ernment: all counties having over 1.-
000,000 inhabitants to have consoli-
dated city-county government and
may form their own county charters.
Other counties and cities may draft
their own charters or may accept
charters proposed by the legislature.

C Dean Lanfear To Deal
With Fraternities
As Single Units

The Uiiivei'sity withdrew its
approval and recognition of In-
terfraternity council last Wed-
nesday, according to a letter
sent out by Dr. Vincent W’. Lan-
fear, dean of men, that day.

The letter reads. “I am very
sorry to learn that the thirteen
social fi‘a.ternitie,s have been una-
ble to iron out the dissension in
the lnterfraternity Council that
now exists over-~l election of offi-
cers. Obviouslyj no organization
can function effigtiently in such a.
state of dissension. It seems evi-
dent that if the Council 4 cannot
handle small issues ha.1‘m0ni011S1Y
it certainly is not capable of deal-
ing with more important matters.

“I met with agi committee from
both groups and {W-as disappointed
to ﬁnd that our discussion had not
proved fruitful of results at the
Tuesday night meeting.

“Realizing that the members
of Interfraternity Council with
the present attitude can be of lit-
tle service to the fraternities or
to the University, I feel it neces-
sary to withdraw our approval
and recognition of lnterfraternity
Council. The individual fraterni-
ties will now deal directly with
the Office of the Dean of Men for
their University activities until
such a time as a workable organ-
ization ca.n be created.”

In a statement-ito the Pitt News
yesterday, Dean; Lanfear said,
“The social frater,-i,nities have been
in disagreement oéver the" election
of new officers to lnterfi'a.ternity
Council. Obviously no organiza-
tion can function tefficiently when
divided against itself. University
recognition of } Iuterfraternity
Council was therefore withdrawn
until such time as the members
can work togetlieij harmoniously.”

Carl Cass Draws Up Roster Of 27,
“Pitt Players Honor Roll For 1934”

4?...

Banquet May 22 To Close
Year’s Activities In
Dramatics

With a farewell banquet on May
22, twenty-seven students will close
their activities in campus dramatics.
In honor of the occasion, Carl B. Cass
has prepared a roster of graduation
students who have been outstanding
in this activity during the past four
years: the Pitt Players Honor Roll
for 1934,

Leading the roll is Carl Swartz,
president of the Players, who has had
prominent parts in “Captain Apple-
jack,” “The Swan,” “Craig’s Wife,”
“The Queen’s Husband” and two one-
acts, and has contributed service to
the technical staff.

Roles in “The Swan,” “Enter Mad-
ame,” “Minick,” “The Queeii’s Hus-
band,” “The Torch Bearers” and one
one-act are to the credit of Betty
Quarrie.

“Captain Applejack,” “Enter Mad-
am,” “Craig's Wife,” “The Queen’s
Husband” and three one-acts saw
services of Herbert Fine; “He Who
Gets Slapped,” “The Swan" and “The
Children of the Moon” are on the list
of Florence Price; and the casts of
“The Torch Bearers,” “Minick” and
"three one-acts included the name of

Barbara Mateer, secretary of the
Players.

Vice President Ruth Drum has
played in “Captain Applejack” and

“Craig’s 'Wife,” besides giving gen-
eral service to the group; Harriet
Sloan has participated in “The Swan”
and two one-acts; and Fern Wolf has
had parts in “Ci'aig’s \Vife” and “The
Torch Bearers.”

Although Dorothy Kaufman, who
has leading roles in “Craig’s VVife,"
“Children of the M.ooii” and a one-
act during her two years at Pitt,
does not graduate this year, she will

transfer to the Research Bureau of
Retail Training and will cease her
activities with the Pitt Players,

But the success of a play depends
as much on the people back stage as
the actors on stage, and so the roster
honors the unsung heroes of a
dramatic group, the technical and bus-
iness staffs. VVilliam Herron, busi-
ness manager, has given three years
of service to the staff. Herbert King,
in his present position as technical
manager and his former job of elec-
trical manager, has been active for
three years,

During his technical managing, Rob-
ert McCoiiiiell, Jr., designed and con-
structed lighting equipment for a
model stage set; an accomplishment
that rewarded him a two-page story
in “The Cue,” magazine of Theta Al-
pha Phi, honorary national dramatic
fraternity. McConnell is president of‘
the local chapter of Theta Alpha Phi.

Spaulding Fegely has contributed to
the success of Pitt plays during the
past three years in his position as
stage manager, and Homer Collins has
for four years been an active tech-
nician.

Pi Tau Phi Will Initiate
New Members Tonight

 

Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic fra-
ternity, will initiate their new meni-
bers tonight at a banquet to take
place at the College club at 6:30
o’clock. G, W'ashington Marshﬁeld,
C34, retiring president, will preside
at the banquet.

Dr. M. G. Gabbert, head of the de-
partment of philosophy, will speak on
the “Theory of Education.”

The retiring officers of the organi-
zation are Marshﬁeld, Morris Kauff-
man, C34, vice president, Lois Cowan,
Med35, secretary, and Richard Neis,
C34, treasurer,

Mixing Metaphors And Politics

It must be said of the dear departed Alphas and Betas that they were
true soldiers to the last ditch. But then they made their own ditches and
probably knew what they would have to lie in.
changes of blank cartridges we've seen in many a year, both factions of Inter-
fraternity council huffed and puffed until they blew the whole house in. Now
Interfraternity council is just a. memory, and alpha and beta are the ﬁrst two

letters of the Greek alphabet.

The campus at large has not been greatly disturbed about the friction

in one of its major bodies, as was evinced by the meager voting in the recent

election.

names was the order of the day.

Those students interested in campus government were alarmed, as
usual, by the threatened coalition control of such legislation as might arise,
and rallied almost enough to break the Alpha rule. Members of the fraterni-
ties concerned grew very indignant about the whole situation, and calling

Interfraternity council is not a question calling for partisanship from this
corner. The loss of the Interfraternity Ball and the Interfraternity Handbook
may be a crying matter, but we do not see it that Way. More than that. we
cannot see what cataclysmic difference there would be between the handling

of such matters by one group or another.

The disturbing factor is that a

supposedly united brotherhood cannot keep peace in the family long enough

to have a. regular election of ofﬁcers.

One election is held. Four Alphas are elected. Beta fraternities rise in
a body to howl that they were not notiﬁed of the election, that it was irregu-

lar and must be done again. Alphas protest. Betas insist.
right, then, we’ll let you have two ofﬁcers.

Finally ofﬁcers are voted

The council is pronounced null and void by the administration.

It may be “alarmism” to use this situation as a pointer, but what has

happened once may happen again.

Student governmental bodies are allowed

to be “on their own,” but it is expected of them that they at lea-st maintain
enough equilibrium to be able to proceed with the management of their af-
fairs. Coalitions and strife are also to be expected. But when the groups
take irreconcilable positions, and say, in effect, to each other, “Here we are,
and there you are, and we'll be hanged if we make the ﬁrst move in your

direction ! ” . .

. then it is to be expected that someone will take a stick to

the whole organization, and end it if that is the only way to gain peace.

Rich Man, Poor Man, Coach, Cook
And Then Professor--Some Climb!

 

The road to a. university profes-
sorship is not always the most erudite,
if a road, in any case, may be called
erudite. Many bumps, some humorous,
some not, have to be endured before
the ultimate goal is reached.

Among the present history “profs,” ‘

the range of job-ﬁlling runs from
waiter to coach of athletics. Dr. An-
drew N. Cleven, professor of history,
was a waiter at Miami university,
worked in the postofﬁce at the Uni-
versity of Chicago, and -tended fur-
naces. W. J, Martin, assistant pro-
fessor of history, modestly confessed
that he was a waiter in a women’s
dormitory (by the way, his admit-
ting it was a slip). Hoisting bricks in
a brickyard gave Mr, Martin the ath-
letic robustness that he now has.
Also listed among his pre-professor-
ship activities were book selling, work-
ing for kitchen cabinet and tire com-
panies. Shingling, cutting timber and
sawing wood formed the carpenter’s
trade for Dr. Alfred P. James, pro-
fessor of history. Life insurance agent,
traveling salesman for a publishing
company, and assistant cashiership

Second Time, 151/_;_ to 21/2

 

The University of Pittsburgh's un-
defeated golfers annexed the inter-
collegiate golf championship of Pitts-
burgh Saturday at the Pittsburgh
Field Club.

They won their second victory of
he season over Carnegie Tech by
the run-a-way score of 151%; to 2%.
The Nassau system of scoring, one
point for each nine and a point for
the match, was used.

Claude McKee, tri-state intercolle-
giate champion, could get no more
than a half for Pitt, from Charles Kay
of Tech, _ ,

The low medal for the day was
taken by the -Panther’s captain and
No. 1 man, Regis VVolff. His 77 de-
feated Joel Haverstick, Tech captain,
5 and 3.

The summary of the match follows:

Regis Vi/olff, Pitt, defeated Joel
Haverstick, 5 and 3, to gain 3 points.

Claude McKee, Pitt, and Charles
Kay, Tech, halved. This gave each
man 1% points,

John Wasco, Pitt, defeated Jack
Reese, 6 and 5. Wasco won all 3
points.

Art Mathews, Pitt, got 3 points

[when he defeated James Herron, 4

and 3. .
Sammy Decker, Pitt, defeated Al
Burgoyne, Tech, 1 up. As a result
the Panthers won 2 points and Tech 1.
A1 Ferraro, Pitt, defeated Jack Pro-

the Panthers,

Convention Plans
New Constitution

(Continued From Page One.)

All local oﬁicers will be responsible
to the county commissioners and the
latter to the governor—all to be sub-
ject to recall by the people. The
legislature to consolidate counties
shall be subject to the approval of the
voters.

Although some of these changes are
very signiﬁcant, the omissions per-
haps even more so. The constitution
as drafted by the students is much
briefer and more general than the
present one and leaves more to be de-
termined by the legislature. Thus it
should be more ﬂexible and save the
people time and money lost in inces-
sant amendments. The University was
represented by ten delegates. .

The complete drafted constitution,
as ﬁnally drawn up by Pitt students
who were commissioned by the dele-
gates at the convention to complete
it from the recommendations of the
convention will be found, on page 2.

OMER E. KRONENWETTER
Guest Columnist
It seems as though there ought to be some kind of a birthday celebration

S0011.

Of course, Franklin Delano had his birthday parties all over the coun-

try and a sizeable amount of money was collected for the drive against infan-

tile paralysis.

Besides that, March 4 is past long ago, and there were a lot

of rejoicing democratic celebrations, although none of them attained national

SCODG.

The glorious Fourth is not to far off, but it is so traditional that it

has lost all its originality.
well and good. but what this country
needs is a. new and different sort of a
birthday party. .

Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you
Mr. Dillinger! He is now public enemy
Number One, and yet he is the peo-
ple’s friend. And why? I'll tell you.

It’s about a year ago that friend
Dillinger ﬁrst cracked the pen and
took it on the lam. Where did he go?
To Greece to ﬁght extradition papers
and newspaper men? No, a thousand
times no! Did he hide out in the
mountain fastness of Saskatchewan?
Again no. (Anyhow. the Northwest-
ern mounted might have got him
there.) Did he seek the protecting
haven of some too broad-minded South
American republic? Never, never,
never! Dill is an American, and “See
America First” is his motto.

He didn’t just hide away, either. A
man must live. Just as the lowly pot-
ter daily spins his wheel and plies his
trade, and as the scissors sharpener
goes daily to the same old grind, and
as the plumber, day after day,:forgets
his tools. even so John Dillinger car-
ries on hisibusiness. He has been
called a fugitive from justice. Why,
then. shouldihe not continue to be
one? All his (free) life, he has been
treated as a thief. murderer, criminal
and whatnot. VVell, the show must
go on. - =

What if. ladies and gentlemen, this
man should really be caught? Vvhy,
for one‘thing, this birthday party
would.have.no reason for being held.
And that isn’t all. \Vhat would the
newspapersdo? And the police? And
the.‘ school teachers? And the jails,
the reformatories, and the movies?

All over the country school teachers
are saying to their pupils, “Dillinger
is a bad man. VVhen he is caught he
will be e—lec-tro—cuted!” The reform
schools are learning. lots of things
against which to warn the wicked in-
mates. Prisoners all over the coun-
try are saying,-“Chee, some mugs get
all the luck!” And the movies! They
haven't produced much on it so far.
but some eighty thousand feet of
news-reels but in practically no time
at all the nation will he re-ﬂooded with
epics like “I Am a Fugitive from a
Chain Gang.”

It is the newspapermen and the
doughty arm of the law, though, that
get’s the real “breaks.” If Dillinger
didget caught, there would be but
two weeks or so of court procedure
and recapitulation, and then it would
be all over. Now, however, circulation
is staying at the high peak it reached
when Dill began his flight-orgy. There
is no more frantic hair-tearing and
worrying about what shall get stream-
er headlines; any story that can by
any stretch of imagination be linked
to the manhunt is given an attractive
spot on page one. Spanish-American
revolution stories need no longer be
“padded” and Aimee Semple McP.
Hutton (or has she remarried?) can
squawk all she wants to about pub-
licity. Good old Dillinger, says our!’
sensation-seeking press, “long may he,
rave!”

And the police! The good old relia-
ble, powerful, clever, astute police!
Who would take the blame for all
those unsolved crimes "if Dill were
caught? And what. of the pay checks
for overtime, etc.. if the search were
suddenly terminated? Why, this Dil-
linger is bread and? butter!

So, ladies and gentlemen, a toast to
Dillinger—the rat!

Novel Grangplank Wrecked
As Sailors Sweep On
Deck For Dance

Spring Festival VVeek drew to a
close Friday night with the bell-ring-
ing Collegiate Cruise, and almost
ended with a bang when the gang-
plank entrance to the ballroom deck:
crashed under the rush of the gobs
and their sweethearts to dance to the
tunes of Duke Morris and his band,

The maritime atmosphere in the
Schenley ballrooms was complete.
from the ship’s wheel and bell be-
hind the orchestra to the gob hats
and blouses that many of thedancers
wore. Only the sea breezes “carrying
the tang of salt water were lacking.

Sailors were on,h_a,I1d to hell) the
coeds down the extremely slippery
gang-plank, but they left the hapless
men to shift for themselves, and the
“shifting” was too much for the gang-
plank. It fell to the floor shortly after
the ﬁrst dance. After the wreckage
was cleared away, entrances were
perfectly sedate through the huge
porthole labeled “S. S. Cathedral -Of
Learning."

Enice Natali announced the judges’
awards in the ﬂoat parade contest and
Muriel Dils received the cup for
Zeta Tau Alpha, whose prize-winning
ﬂoat was based on the slogan, “Time
to Retire.” Second prize went to Del-
ta Delta Delta for "Hasn’t Scratched
Yet,” and Peg Froats took the cup
for her fraternity. Honorable mention
went to Chi Omega and Tlleta P111
Alpha. ° ‘- '

Judges for the ﬂoat parade were
Miss Grace Ely, Miss Thyrsa»W. Amos,
Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, George Carver,
Dr. Ralph Turner, Ruth Bowser and
Hazel Lincoln.

Delta Tau Delta won ﬁrst ‘place in-
the interfraternity sweepstakes, Theta
Chi second and Phi Kappa came in
third. Although four cars turned com-
pletely over at “Dead Man’s Curvel’
when the. sweepstakes were run Fri-
day afternoon, causing a great deal
of excitement among both spectators
and participants, no fatalities were
reported.

It was announced that the senior
-women’s class took ﬁrst place in the
women's sports frolic of Friday after-
noon, but second place had not yet
been decided when the announcement
was made.

Credit goes to the Collegiate Cruise
committee, under John Holbrook as
chairman, for planning and executing
one of the most entertaining dances
of the year, for the cry now goes
around, “A. sailor’s life for me!’

Statistically S p e a k in g
For Pitt Players
Activities

Statistically speaking, out of the
242 students registeredthis year in
Pitt Players, 140 participated in one
or more capacity. Thirty-three of
these members had parts in one or
more of the three major plays pre-
sented this season and seventy-three
took part in the twenty-two one-act
plays produced by members of the
Play Production class. Twenty-six
students acted parts in more than
one play.

During the preparation and produc-
tion of the major plays this year,
thirty-one students gave their serv-
ices and thirty students had positions
on the various Droduction committees
on the technical staff. The business

managing of the productions brought
Thirty-
three students served on business, pro-
duction or technical staffs for more
than one major play_

Of the student actors this year,
twenty—six took parts in more than
one play. But perhaps the most sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgures are those showing that
twen,ty—eight students were active on

’more than one staff and in more than

one capacity. All of which proves
that there are Pitt Players who can
paint a paper mache ﬁre place, direct

a one-act comedy, sell ten tickets and.

play the part of a villain, all with
equal ease.

the edge of the track. Ryan had pre-

Commons Room Nears Completion
As News Reporter Investigates

Senior P r o m s, Gatherings,
Receptions Will Take
Place In Room"

By John Hesselbein

Most disordered in general appear-
ance of all incompleted parts of the
Cathedral, yet presenting a complex
picture of the utmost precision in
workmanship is the huge empty space,
immediately to the right of the pass-‘
ageway from the Fifth avenue en-g
rtrance to the elevators. This vast}
hollow will some day be the pride of{
the University of Pittsburgh's Cathe-[
dral. Now it is little more than any
unenclosed barn, striking argument in:
favor of the success of -Chancellor;
Bowman's drive for the necessaryi.
construction funds to ﬁnish it.

Some day——and contractors say
within a year, if construction is con-
tinued at the present rate — this
room, the Commons room will
be the most interesting fea-

ture of the Cathedral, with the excep-
tion possibly of the observation tower
forty stories above. It will be im-
mense in size, embracing a ﬁoor area
-of slightly more than a third of an_
acre. This means that its ﬂoor spacef
will be three times as large as the:
entire lobby of the William Penn]
hotel. A 

The room will be 52 feet in height.
‘The cubic footage will be so much
that both Alumni hall and ‘State hall,
could be placed in it at once. 3

C011-1
tractors making that statement modi-
tied it somewhat by saying that the
cubic footage of the room‘ will be
greater than the total cubic footage
of both State and Alumni halls. i

The two bare concrete pillars which
now rise from the floor to the ceiling
in the center of the room, contain
steel supports said to be the largest
ever made for building construction.
These pillars help to support 20
stories.

According to present plans the Com-
mons room will be put primarily to
social uses*—forma1 gatherings o-f stu-
dents and faculty_ It will be the vast
social room, “digniﬁed, quiet, beauti-
ful, ever useful.” In it will take place
the senior prom and commencement
reception. At other times it will be
the meeting place of students in
groups of all sizes and types.

The social heads of the University
will have offices directly off the Com-
mons room, tl1us- being in closest
touch with the phase of activity with
which they are particularly connected.

The distance across this mammoth
school room will be 170 feet. and the
depth will be 70 feet. It will be pos-
sible to seat 2,000 persons comfortably
in the room.

Three levels of classrooms will sur-
round the Commons room. On the
first level, directly off from the ﬂoor,
will be the Nationality rooms, enough
money already having been collected
to decorate and furnish them, besides
money to assist in the general con-
struction program.

Surrounding the Commons room on
the second level will be class rooms,
decorated and furnished to interpret
the history of Western Pennsylvania.
It is proposed that ﬁfteen counties
and their outstanding personalities,

and events shall have recognition——
each with 3, room. In addition, there
is proposed an Indian room, and trad-
ers’ room, a room which will_show the
time of the early French‘ settlers, a
Proprietary room, depicting the time
of William Penn, and a Provincial

room. 1-ecalling the period of Wash-, _

ington and his associates.‘

The third leve1.above the Commons
room will be devoted to class rooms,
in which the history and geography
of Pittsburgh and its -immediate en-
virons will be accentuated. It will
tell the story of the people of Pitts-
burgh.

' Although __there will be no class-
rooms opening onto a ba-lcotny beyond
these leads, the Commons room will
extend into four stories. A series of

faculty conference rooms will extend-_-- --

around the building on this 'floor._.;.

Destined tobe the world’s greatest - ‘
school room, this immense lobby" I.-11_‘ow ‘

is a beehive of activity. Three levels

‘of workmen can be seen from ” the

floor of this massive place. All, are
busy, laying bricks and stones, ﬁtting
windows, pipes, sheet metal heating
and ventilation systems, hoisting
steel—practically everything. Almost
every type of work being done in the
entire Cathedral can -be viewed mere-
ly by looking around the Commons
room. 
And whe-n the dinner whistle blows,
a.deep rumbling fog horn that can.be
heard all over the lower ﬂoors of the
-building, men on all levels simultan-
ously drop tools Wherever they are
and run for theirlunch buckets. This
is how it will be, too, a year from
now if the Cathedral drive is success-
ful. Only, students will be doing the
running, andra bell will be the dinner
signal. And there will be lnindreds
more of them: a true spectacle jto
see. '

E./l. Kleinman To Replace
Wilson On Military Staff

Lieutenant Arthur E. Wilson, as-
sistant professor of military science
and tactics, is being transferred from
service on the University faculty and
will be replaced by Lieutenant E. ‘A.
Kleinman, a classmate of Lieutenant
’1‘redennick, graduated from T/Vest
Point in the class of 1922.

Lieutenant ‘Wilson was born in
Maine on July 2, 1895, and enlisted as
a private in Company 10, Coast Ar-
tillery corps, on May 1, 1917. By Sep-
tember 24, 1918, he had. reached the
rank of corporal and on September
25, 1918, he was appointed the com-
mission of second lieutenant, which
position he vacated on September 5,
1920. He was recommissioned as sec-
ond lieutenant on July 1, 1921, and
he accepted on September 5, 1921. On
July 1, 1921, the day that he was com-
missioned second lieutenant, he was
also promoted to the rank of’ ﬁrst
lieutenant.

Lieutenant VVilson was graduated
from the Coast Artillery school, bat-
tery ofﬁcers’ course, in 1923 and en-
tered service on the University fac-

ulty in September of the same year_'

Lieutenant Tredennick has been
given command of the Pitt band, but
as yet he has formed no deﬁnite
plans concerning the management of
that organization.

Preface:

sic being called a darby. It is most
emphatically a derby.

Churchill Downs is a one-mile track.
The Derby distance is one and one-
quarter miles long.

Never bet on a ﬁlly in a race of a
mile or over. They don’t have the
endurance to last. (This tip cost me
two dollars. I bet on the ﬁlly, Mata
Hari.)

If the track is heavy (muddy to you)
bet on the horse with the biggest
hoof. He is best able to run through
mud.

Kentucky moons are all they are
cracked up to be!

The Downs are a very poor place to
have a horse race. They are built so
that very few spectators can see all
of the race.

Gleanings From A Trip To The Derby

This writer along with seven other members of the News
last week attended a newspaper convention in Lexington, Kentucky, and later
sat in on the Kentucky Derby. The following are some items which may
(probably not) be of interest to two or three of you.

Man 0’ War is now used for stud
purposes. In appearance he lives up
to all you have heard about him.
