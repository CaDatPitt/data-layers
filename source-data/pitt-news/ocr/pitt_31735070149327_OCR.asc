Obama expected to unveil
  ambitious agenda during
  State of the Union address

Leslie Clark and Anita

WASHINGTON — A conﬁdent
President Barack Obama is expect-
ed Tuesday to unveil an aggres-

sive agenda in the ﬁrst State of the

Union address of hisgsecond term,
calling for a rewrite of the nation’s
outdatedimmigration laws, steps
to prevent gun violence and ways
to bolster a still-fragile economy.
Obama starts his second term
with job approval ratingsamong
the highest since he took office.
But he faces a not—yet-recovered
economy, a mounting deﬁcit, -an

often hostile Congress and a na— 3

tion increasingly distrustful that
polarized, partisan Washington
can get anything done. A

In many ways, the address
serves as a marker for what the
president hopes will form his lega-
cy. After outlining his second—term
agenda in an inaugural speech last
month that inﬁiriated. Republicans
for its full-throated embrace of lib-
eralism, Obama will deliver details
of what he wants to accomplish,
priorities that include energy in-
dependence, education and job
creation.

“A lot of people think the State
of the Union is empty rhetoric, but
it’s full of speciﬁc requests,”. said
Robert Lehrman, a former speech-
writer for former Vice President Al

Gore and a communications pro— “

fessor at American University. “It’s
not only the state of the union, but
the state of the Obama adminis-
tration.”

Tens of millions are expected
to watch the 9 pm. EST address,

which Obama will deliver from the
U.S. Capitol; in 2012, 38 million
households tuned in. Sen. Marco
Rubio of Florida, a rising star in his
party who has garnered buzz as a
possible 2016 presidential con-
tender, will deliver the Republican
response in English and in Spanish.
Rubio has been leading an im-
migration overhaul in the Senate,
but Republicans are eager for the
conservative freshman to illustrate
the party’s biggest point of conten-
tion with Obama: his stewardship
of the economy.
Thismyear’sgsp(eech marks the
100th’ anniversary of thelvstate of
the Union. Though George Wash-
ington was the ﬁrst president to

address Congress, speeches soon

were scrapped infavor of the writ-
ten word. Woodrow Wilson, how-
ever, reconstituted the in-person
delivery to Congress in 1913, a cus-
tom that has continued ever since.

White House officials declined
to divulge details, but Obama gave
a preview of his remarks to House
of Representatives Democrats on
Thursday, telling them he would
talk about ensuring an economy
that works for all.

“I’m going to be talking about
making sure that we’re focused on
job creation,” he said. “It means
thatlwe’re focused on education
and that every young person is
equipped with the skills they need
to compete in the 21st century. It
means that we’ve got an energy
agenda that can make us less de-
pendent on foreign o.i1, but also

that we’re cultivating the kind of '

clean energy strategy that will
maintain our leadershipwell into

Programs hope to provide ‘edge’

Pitt3‘5ummer Edge experience aims to deliver compre/éensive education

Matt Schaff, Elizabeth
Furiga & Pat McAteer
The Pitt News Staﬁ”

With the application deadline ,
quickly approaching, leaders of
Pitt’s new Summer Edge experi-
ence are hopeful that applicants
will ﬂock to their six constitutive

_Edge programs, which eachaim -

to provide undergraduates with

. a cohesive summer educational .

experience, all at a price.
Each Edge program will accept

‘ cohorts of 30 students, who will

each pay between $6,000 and
$9,300 in tuition to earn six to
312 credits learning about public
health, energy engineering, en-
trepreneurship, business ethics,
biomedicine or career exploration
in the 2013 summer. The dead-
line to apply is this Saturday, Feb.
15. Interested students can apply
via a link on the front page of the
my.pitt portal.

“This is more than a set of
courses. It has added value,” said
Juan Manfredi, vice provost for
undergraduate studies and a co-
ordinator of-the Edge programs.

In’ the summer of 2012, the pro—‘

vost’s ofﬁce conceived the Edge
idea and, in the fall term, solicited
Pitt schools to participate.

“It’s a different offering, and
I think it will be very attractive
to some students, but not all the
students,” Manfredi said.

It won’t, ‘for example, appeal
to most students who are seeking
to use summer classes to speed
their way toward the completion
of majors. Only the engineering
program could provide partici-

pants with an official certiﬁcate
and — assuming they’re engineers
—— assurance that Edge credits
will count toward speciﬁc majors.
Those who complete any other pro-
gram will receive a note on their
Pitt transcript indicating participa-
tion in the Summer Edge program
and have their credits count toward
the gross graduation minimum re-
quirement.

-Edge programs also share a
different cost structure than do
traditional summer-term classes.
Although the Edge experience will
cost more in absolute terms than
the Pitt student’s typical three-
to—s_ix credit brush with summer
classes, they will cost less per
credit: In—state students will pay
on average $538 per credit through
the Edge programs, whereas Diet-
rich School credits cost them $655
per credit this year. The exception
is the career exploration program,
whichwill cost $1,000 per credit.

The programs differ sharply
based on the students they target.
Two programs — engineering and
biomedicine — hope to attract stu-
dents who major in related ﬁelds.
Three programs —— public health,
entrepreneurship and business
ethics — primarily seek students
with outside interests. The career
exploration program, according
to Manfredi, is designed for un-
declared students.

Engineering — 12 credits, 12
weeks

Out of the six Edge programs,
the engineering program, “En-
ergy Today, Energy Tomorrow,”
models itself most closely on ex-
isting academic opportunities at
Pitt. After completing coursework
at Pitt and energy-focused study
abroad experiences in either Aus-
tralia or Brazil, Edge participants
would earn a certiﬁcate that the
Swanson School of Engineering has
previously called the Certiﬁcate in
Energy Resource Utilization.

“We want to make sure we offer
something of high academic value
and high gravity,” said Larry Shu-
man, associate dean of academic
affairs in the Swanson School.

A major part of the Swanson
School’s motivation is to offer at-
tractive options to engineering
co-op students, who are required
to spend at least one summer tak-
ing classes on campus if they want
to graduate in four years instead
of ﬁve. . « ’

“We will have somewhere be-
tween 200 and 250 students here

‘sity Honors College is bu

this summer looking for full-time
courseloads. One of the ideas is,
‘How can we take advantage of
Summer Edge and the fact that
we have students that are looking
for full-time courses and also their
international opportunities?”’ Shu-
man said.

Though the program welcomes

undergraduates from other schools ‘

to apply, Shuman believes the en-
ergy program — especially consid-
ering its international components
— will allow Pitt engineers, in par-
ticular, to “edge” out competitors.

“Everything being equal, ‘Hey, ~

I’m knowledgeable in energy. I’ve
spent ﬁve weeks in Australia look-
ing at energy, or I spent two weeks
in Brazil, focused on sustainabil-
ity,” Shuman said. “It’s that little
bit of extra edge that they bring
to the table when theyV;either go

V out and look for a job or apply, to

graduate school.” : ‘

Health Sciences — 12 credits,
12 weeks ', 

In contrast to the Siﬂiéanson
School’s approach, the Univer-

 

collection of never—before-ffested
courses to serve students applying
for the health sciences Edge‘ pro-

gram, “Medicine and Biomedical

Research: Concepts and Vaﬁies in
Medicine.”

“We have a lot to do, _
way anybody who’s tqacffing a
course for the ﬁrst time‘  a lot
to do,” said Edward Strickeiﬁ-dean
of the UHC and coordinator of the
health sciences program, “You
have to think about what yd}, want
to cover, why you’re going tocover
it, how you’re going to cover it.”

Although still in its planning
stages, the new curriculum is
planned to immerse participants
in a tightly woven package of ex-
posures to the philosophical prob-
lems surrounding medicine, the
primary biomedical literature and
the junction between lab benches
and clinical practice — the latter of
which will involve weekly presenta-
tions from practicing clinicians.

“If you’re going to head-down
this road toward a career in bio-
medical science, there are certain
experiences that will be useful to
have. We’re notproviding all of the
ones that [students] migl_rt..»ﬁnd

ence we’re not providing,” Stricker
said. ‘fBut to the extent that we can
raise issues that are worth raising
in the classroom, they might not
have had those kinds of classroom

experiences before.”

Stricker conceives of the Vedge

“Students would have a clearer
idea of what they’re getting into, an
idea which might either reinforce
their original inclination to go into
this area, or it might dissuade them
from doing it,” Stricker said.
Nonetheless, both Stricker and
Neuroscience Department Chair-

man Alan Sved, who will teach the '

primary literature component
alongside Stricker, ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to derive a universal deﬁnition of
“edge.” ‘

“Not having taught this course

dents are registering for it, I expect
a discussion on the ﬁrst day of class
as to goals and interests of the stu-
dents,” Sved said.

the future.” A

In the months since he de-
feated challenger Mitt Romney,
Obama already has waged battle
with congressional Republicans
over tax increases and spending
reductions. Last week, he urged
Congress to pass a package of
modest cuts and tax changes as a
way to delay what the government
calls sequester cuts — drastic,
across-the-board federal—spend—
ing reductions that are scheduled
to take effect March 1. .

“We’re going to talk about, yes,
deﬁcits and taxes and sequesters
and potential government shut-
downs and [the] debt ceiling,”
Obama told House Democrats.

V “We’l1 talk aboutpthat stuff, but all
from the perspective of how are we
making sure that somebody who
works hard in this country _— a
cop or a teacher or a construction
worker or a receptionist —— that
they can make it if they work hard,
and that their kids can make it and
dream even bigger dreams than
they have achieved.” A

Education advocates say the

Edge D 3

speech could contain a signiﬁcant

early-childhood education initia-
tive.

For the nation’s employers,
energy, trade and regulations are
chief concerns. But topping the list
for most businesses, however, is
what happens with negotiations to
reduce the deﬁcit through spend-
ing cuts, new taxes or some mix
of both.

“What I’d like to hear on ﬁs-
cal policy is a clear delineation of
what and how many spending cuts
are going to be coming forward,
and what and how many tax in-
creases he would like to see, so we
can evaluate the policy,” said Mar-
tin Regalia, chief economist for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Presidential speechwriters face
enormous pressure from groups
like the chamber, as well as from
agencies and issue advocates eager
for a presidential plug, Lehrman
said. '

“It’s hard to resist these peo-
ple,” he said. V

combination of coursework and ﬁeld ex-

undergraduates considering futures in
public health. .

“[Inter.yiewers and admission officers]

Entrepreneurship, Business Ethics —— 

credits, 12 weeks g V, A V
With a strong desire to attract students’
with interests outside its disciplines, the

Katz School of Business contributes two A

distinct programs to the Edge series, “En—
trepreneurship and Organizational Innova-
tion” and “Ethical Leadership in Business
and Society.”

“Entrepreneurship acumen is something
that exists regardless of major,” said Paul

Harper,‘ assistant profeslsor in the Katz .

School and ‘coordinator of the entrepre-
neurship program. “Entrepreneurship is a
very diverse construct, and we want to start
having a student population that’s working
on bringing all those perspectives in.”

Fellow assistant professor Ray Jones,
who coordinates the sister Edge program on
leadership ethics, as well as the certiﬁcate
program in Leadership in Ethics within the
College of Business Administration, also
views his subject matter as academically
universal.

“There are a lot of students outside the
business school who have an interest in
leadership,” he said.

Participants in the Katz School programs
will take three brand-new classroom cours-
es and one experiential capstone, which
involves either a novel business plan or a
community—service project. The course-
work of the entrepreneurship program,
all taught by Harper, will guide students
through the theory of entrepreneurship, its
role within organizational strategy and its
socioeconomic effects. On the other hand,
four different instructors will deliver the
leadership ethics curriculum, which, mod-
eled on the existing CPLE certiﬁcate, will

address ethical decision making, ethical ‘

theory and social responsibility in business.
Both programs will tap into community
partners. —

The entrepreneurship program will
teach participants how to convert their
education into “marketability,” according
to Harper.

“Great what you’re studying, but at some
point, there’s the job search,” he said. “This
is going to be a great legitimizer for them.”

The shorter six—week timeline of the pro-
gram will prove an asset to participants,
according to Ryan Sweeny, assistant direc-
tor of the Office of Career Development and

Obama administration’s use of
drones immoral and undemocratic

Eric Baldin ‘
' Columnist

In the aftermath of 9/11, the
United States has augmented its
defense apparatus on every front
and has employed a variety of
new tactics and instruments, all
in the name of creating a more
secure homeland and quelling
terrorist activity abroad. While
thisrationale has precipitated
two wars and a range of other
strategic defense moves, noth-
ing has flown quite so far ‘under

the radar of the public eye as the

use of unmanned aerial vehicles,
otherwise known as drones.
Drones are sent out at high
altitudes into hostile and for-
eign airspace on reconnaissance
and strike missions. Air Fo.rce
personnel in the United States
who serve as “remote pilots”
maneuver the aircraft fromfa
land position. Using a variety

of high-power and precise cam-
eras, the drones are able to ob-
tain thousands of images and
hours of video footage, captur-
ing everything from the mun-
dane activities of tribal people
in rural parts of the Hindu Kush
mountains to live street views of
a market in Karachi, Pakistan.
While this serves to track and
pinpoint people of interest to
the U.S. intelligence and defense
community, the ramifications
of this type of equipment are

disturbing. These drones are
equipped with combat weapons-

that are, compared to manned
aircraft and more antiquated
aircraft, precise and highly le-
thal. ’

The U.S. carries out most of
these reconnaissance and strike
missions with little or no warn-
ing to the sovereign government
of the country in which they are
operating, and there is no re-
corded agreement between the

United States.and countries
affected by the ongoing drone
combat tactics. There are no
publicly available guidelines
for choosing targets, and the
hierarchy for approving a strike
is obscured and kept classified
by the intelligence and defense

community. L . -
The Obama administratio

claims to possess the unreserved
right to order strikes on human
targets, both foreign and U.S.
citizens, per the 2001 congres-
sional authorization granting
the president power to use mil-
itary force against al—Qaida.
Since the drone program’s in-

ception, 400 Strikes have been

carried out and 3,000 people
killed, mostly in rural Pakistan.

Upon initial review, the use of
drones to secure the American
homeland and protect U.S. in-
terests abroad seems necessary

Shamrock Shakes are back, and

you might have noticed a mil-

lion Facebook posts about how
excited everyone is. Clearly, Mc-
Donald’s is playing ajedi mind
trick on everyone. But the trick
isn’t the buzz over Shamrock
Shakes (coming back. after _a”six-
month absence," it’s that they’re

playing into our love of seasonal _
. gimmicks. ' V

If I sold a “shake” made of
vanilla ice cream, high fructose
corn syrup and natural ﬂavor
from a mysterious plant’-source,

no one would buy it. But when ‘
McDonald’s dubs it _a Shamrock

Shake‘ and starts marketing,
people get excited. Starbucks,
another gigantic business selling
high-calorie: beverages, has its
own seasonal marketing scheme

/.

that employs ‘drinks such as the
pumpkin spice latte‘ (popular
enough to get a nickname, the
PSL) and the peppermint mocha.

This type of marketing is per-
vasive. Corporations have ﬁgured
out that reducing the changingpof

the seasons to a marketing tool is '

extremely proﬁtable, so they take
a phenomenon that symbolically
represents the passing of time
and brings variety and tempo to
our lives, andthey employ it for
their proﬁt. ,

Companies take a theme cen-

tral to ourlives (the changing

of the seasons, in this case) and
commoditize it. The Windows

phone markets itself as ﬁtting

into your busy life, but it can’t
magically bring calm to the hec-
tic schedule you keep. Breakfast

cereals (think Wheaties) try to 7

associate themselves with better
performance in school, but any

nutritious breakfast will produce
the same cognitive effects.
Unsurprisingly, Pitt has picked-

up on this marketing trend, de-

ciding to play on “the competitive
edge.” The former living-learn-
ing communities —— on-campus

‘housing units that vary from '

single ﬂoors to entire dorms
for students with a particular
interest — have been renamed
“Competitive Edge Communi-
ties.” Office of Student Affairs
events in these communities are
often geared toward these inter-
ests and-aim to bring students
together. Labeling a communal
learning experience such as this a
“Competitive Edge” is imprecise,
though admittedly ﬂashy.

to advance America’s broader long-term
Objectives, which mostly culminate in the
continued U.S. possession of global hege-
mony. The use ofthis blatantly undemo-
cratic and immoral warfare tactic may
protect U.S. interests in the short_term
but will have negative long-term ramiﬁ-

cations for the United States’ reputation '
abroad and for the pursuit of America’s

broader international objectives.

Col. Scott Brenton, an Air Force‘ offi-
cer who remotely pilots a drone, said in
an article in The New York Times, “I see
mothers with children. Isee fathers with
children. I see fathers with mothers. I see
kids playing soccer,”‘and that when he
is ordered to strike a militant target, he
attempts to wait for the family and other
civilians to be separated from the target,
but that this is not always possible, and
that oftentimes civilians, including in-
nocent women and children, are killed.

Also, former chief counterterrorism
adviser and current CIA director candi-
date John Brennan said in an article in
The New York Times, “we understand
that there will be innocent children who

will die because of this kind of warfare, '

but we must employ all available means

February 12, 2018 l The Pitt News l \/w\AA/.bifihevvs.corn

to secure American lives and interests.”
The logic is that these tactics do cause
harm and are not subject to the typical
rules of engagement, but that in order to

protect U.S. lives and interests, ‘excep-

tions must be made.

When we begin to make exceptions

United States, they fail to recognize the -

resentment and hatred toward the United
States that happens as a result. Retired
Gen. Stanley McChrystal said in an in-
terview with The New York Times that
drone attacks are “hated on a visceral
level” and that the strikes contribute to

When we begin to make exceptions
for aerial killings, in foreign countries
without the regular form of checks

for aerial killings in foreign countries
without the regular form of checks and
balances reserved for other forms of en-
gagement, we sacrifice democrat-ic stan-

dards and respect for human life for our ‘

down arrogant purposes. While Brennan
and the Obama administration claim that

‘ these attacks are critical to protect the -

a “perception of American arrogance.”

While the rationale behind drone use
might be to protect America and hold
onto American global hegemony, it could
very well be compromising national’se-
curity and putting U.S. citizens further at
risk for attacks by terrorist cells.

This is not just an issue on the level

of individual militants and public resent-
ment in these nations, but continued and
intensifying U.S. drone strikes could lead
to institutional changes in Pakistan and
Yemen —— the countries where U.S. drones
are most active — which could cause
much more substantial threats to the
United States. After violations of nations’
airspaces without permission and strik-
ing at their civilians without consent take
place, the leadership within these na-
tions could grow resentful and unwilling
to cooperate with the United States in
future endeavors that could be critical
to the United States’ foreign-policy and
defense strategies.

What is needed is more transparency,
accountability and oversight of the ad-
ministration’s use of drones. Drone use,
while a safer and more sophisticated al-
ternative to manned aircraft, should be
subjected to the standard set of rules of
engagement. I certainly do not advocate
that the U.S. abandon its mission to target
and remove militants and other persons
threatening American democracy, but
that drone missions should be carried
out in respect to the sovereignty of all
nations and according to established_in—
ternational conventions of war. I

in the same community — hence, “living-

learning community.” Similarly, when stu- '
dents go to the Math Assistance Center, '

the competitive edge comes from learning
the math with the assistance provided —
should we rename it “The Competitive
Edge Assistance in Mathematics?” Call-
ing programs at the University “edge” or
“competitive edge” is superﬂuous because
programs at Pitt all help students learn
and grow, inherently giving them an edge.

The second addition to the" “edge”
family is the Summer Edge programs,
described in a news story by Matt Schaff
in today’s issue. These programs are de-
signed to integrate classroom and expe-
riential learning to provide a complete

summer experience in various fields,

including energy, entrepreneurship and
public health. _ -

Vice Provost Juan Manfredi, who is in
charge of implementing the Summer Edge

program, has indicated that the name was

chosen in conjunction with marketing in
order to “convey the fact that [Summer
Edge]‘is not just a set of classes, [but] it

-is aprogram. Students do many things

together [in and «outside the classroom].
It is not a standard experience.” This is
both an admirable goal for a program and
something that should be kept in mind
when naming it. '
Though less ﬂashy, a more appropriate
name seems to be “Integrated Summer
Experiences in (field)_.’’ As Manfredi point-
ed out, these programs provide an edge
both by connecting classroom learning

to outside‘ experiences and by providing’

developmental opportunities. This revised
name reflects this central component to
the programs without invoking the “com-
petitive edge” motif.

The sad part of this story is that these if

innovative new programs will need to over-
come both the stigma of being summer
classes, something most students strive to
avoid in our culture of summertime fun,
and of being over-branded to the point of
raising suspicion. ,

This, however, is far from the truth.
These programs, though they have never
been run before, seem well-conceived and

designed with the idea of giving students V

a holistic experience -— something busy
students don’t often encounter during
the school year. Unfortunately, since the

:

provost’s office is trying something new,‘

they will only be availabl-eto accomodate

' 180 students in this program this summer.

The best thing that could come of these
summer programs is that the ideas and
opportunities could roll over into the aca-
demic year. This will make the integrated
learning environment the Summer Edge
programs seek, to provide available for
the beneﬁt of a larger portion of the stu-

. dent body.

Although it’s unnecessary and a bit trite
to use the “competitive edge” phrase, pro-
gr_ams such as the guaranteed internship
program suggest strong moves toward
integrating classroom and experiential
learning. These, however, are but the first
steps in an attitude shift that will hopefully
improve the educational experience for all
students at Pitt. I '

“1776”

Through Feb. 24
Pittsburgh Public Theater,
showtimes vary -
Admission: $i5.75—$27.75

The year 1776 was paramounyoung United
States. Not only did the U.S. formally break
ties with Great Britain, but the country be-'
gan the process of deﬁning itself as a singu-
lar entity, a nation in its own right.

On Feb. 1 of this year, the musical “1776”
opened at the Pittsburgh Public Theater as

characters  
the largest show in the theater’s history. The
performance features a cast of 26 members,
an ensemble of six musicians and a con-
ductor. Originally released on Broadway
in 1969, “1776” has received a Tony Award
for best musical and was adapted for a ﬁlm
version in 1972, p A

The musical centers ‘on the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, a crucial mo-
ment in American history. It begins with the
entire Congress singing “Sit Down,]ohn” ——
a song directed at the efforts ofjohn Adams
(the delegate from Massachusetts) in creat-
ing a proposal to break from Great Britain.
Adams has been pushing for this mutiny
for quite some time, and in the sweltering
summer heat of Philadelphia, patience has
a very low threshold.

FEEL THE BURNS

Too much coffee leads to caffeine
overload, addictive qualities
make substance harmful

Coffee is just one source of caffeine for those looking for extra energy. MCT Campus

\

Rebecca Burns
Stag/ff Wrz'ter

Caffeine overload is that familiar moment
when a cup of coffee_— perhaps just the
last sip — was one too many. A ﬂuid mo-
tion of warm tingles transitions to nervous
jitters, then rapidly moves to the ﬁnger-
tips as the eyes widen. In this moment,
energy and alertness are amplified into an
overwhelming, jaw—clenching spasm that
limits the ability to sit still and awakens
the desire to run around the library like
a maniac. -

Before college, besides the occasional
chai tea latte or frappuccino, no part of me
desired a cup of black coffee. Who needs
that? ‘And what is with those people who
claim they are addicted to caffeine, yet
still unconcernedly drink it?

In college, drinking a caffeinated bever-
age is the obvious thing to do. One coffee
date here, another coffee outing there,
two shots of a 5-hour Energy drink and,
soon enough, traces of caffeine coursing
through the bloodstream leave a longing
for — in my case — a sweet soy latte.

Thecurrent rate of consumption of caf-
feine has grown from an already high 80
percent of the North American population
in the’ 1980s. Now, 90 percent of the conti-
nent consumes it on a daily basis, making
caffeine the most widely used psychoactive
substance in the world. That is a lot of java.
Ten billion energy drinks were consumed
by the U.S. in 2010 and sales reached as
high as 9 billion dollars in 2011, proving

that caffeine is indeed in high demand.
_The use of this exhilarating stimulant
'has been debated for decades. The ques-
tion of its effects goes back to 1,000 years
ago, when people would actually chew on
the seeds and leaves of plants containing
caffeine. This may not sound as appetizing
as a steamy mocha latte, but the caffeine
provided them with the same end result.
Today, cooked down into a drinkable form,
the-caffeine from these plants allowsfor
enhanced concentration and a greater ca-
pacity for physical labor. ,

Acting as a mild central-nervous-sys-
tern stimulant, the caffeine moves from the
stomach into the bloodstream. A boost in
mentalalertness begins approximately 15
minutes after the first tasty.sip. Increases

in heart rate and blood pressure, a relax—- .

ation? of the smooth muscle cells _in the

airway and a release of fatty acids and r

glycerol for energy are all physical reac-
tionsjto the caffeine. These effects provide
the extra jolt needed to do a hard workout
or study fora ﬁnal into the night, masking
the perception of fatigue-. Not only does
caffeine corne in tasty packages, it is also
a source of motivation when the rest of
our body is saying it is nap time.

But the question "remains: What makes
caffeine bad? Although there are proven
beneficial effects of caffeine consump-
tion," there area variety of issues that ac-
company excess caffeine use. Moderate
daily_ consumption ranges between 300

rich literary prose, but at the end of the
day, all they teach their reader-is that life
is essentially meaningless,” he said. “I’m
baffled by an author’s. desire to write an
entire novel for that reason, and I see it as
completely counterintuitivejand counterg
productive.”  .

Sauret’s'foray into the Chrgistian liter-
ary world is a homegrown  he de-
cided to publish “Amidst Tra'ﬂ‘ic’,’ without
the help of a large commercial publishing
house. Aided by his sister, publicist Marta
Sauret; his friend, editor Michael O’Brien,
and his photography company, One Way
Street Production, he was able to produce
the content, cover art and promotion with
little commercialassistance.

“It’s funny,‘ because Michel has always
been the way he is,” Marta Sauret said. “He
has always been dedicated, driven, insanely
organized, and just a non—stop hard worker
with whatever project he puts his mind to.”

Born in Rome, Sauret moved with his
family to Pittsburgh when he was 10 years
old, and even when they later moved to
Texas, he knew Pittsburgh was the ultimate
place for him. His collegiate fate was seal_ed
when he received his acceptance letter to
Pitt during basic training for the Army.

His time in the military, including a de-
ployment to Iraq in 2008, prolonged his
education time beyond the typical four—year
student period, but the extended time al-
lowed Sauret to pick up stories and inspira-
tion for “Amidst Trafﬁc,” as well as an award
for Army journalist of the Year.

Publishing a book is a difficult task,
and Sauret credits his bravery entirely to
the experiences he had with Pitt’s English
program. . .

“After serving, Pitt really invigorated
me to want to go back to writing,” Sauret

“Amidst Traffic” features a series of con-

said. “The quality of the writing department
and the caliber of the professors there is

credit it truly deserves.”

Thanks to a non-traditional background
that allowed him to see the world and an
unbelievably positive experience at Pitt,
Sauret has enough material to last him into
his next stab at a novel, called “Jump.” The
novel is about a boy who grows up in a fun-
damentalist Christian home, attends the
University of Pittsburgh and then goes on
a journey of faith. ‘

For now, “Amidst Traffic” is his No. 1
priority and continues to offer a positive
message to readers. '

walk away with this lesson: Dwell inand
appreciate the moment,” O’Brien said. “The

and 400 mg with a recommended ceiling
of 500 mg per day, according to a 2013
article from The Journal of the American
Medical Association. _

The caffeine content of different bev-
erages and foods varies depending on the
plant source, location of where it is grown
and how it is_prepared. For example, a
typical eight-ounce cup of coffee has any-
where from 95 to 200 mg while a cup of
green teahas about 15 mg. A diet Coke has
47 mg of caffeine,_ and a 1.5—ounce piece
of dark chocolate — my favorite —— has
31 mg, in comparison to milk chocolate,
which has 9 mg.

An individual’s physical characteristics .

also come into play. Whether a person
is overweight or underweight, elderly or
young, on medications or has a history of
anxiety disorders, there are differences
in sensitivities to caffeine. Although the
effects of caffeine are temporary, it can

' increases in a person’s diet, tolerances A

cause restlessness, irritability, nervous-
ness, anxiety, headaches and a racing heart
when ingested in large doses.

Many drink caffeinated beverages
without being aware of the actual amount
they are consuming. As caffeine content

develop rapidly along with mild physical
and psychological dependencies. You may
recall a time when you either gave up cof-
fee for a few days or went without an extra
can of Monster and then cursed at the
hammer that pounded within your head.
Headaches, slight depression and fatigue
are withdrawal symptoms of caffeine.

My advice as a'fellow coffee and tea
drinker is to weigh out the pros and cons.
Develop an awareness of how your body
reacts to caffeine and develop a healthy
consumption of the stimulant. Stay atten-
tive to the amount of caffeine you consume
and start to level it to the moderate recom-
mended amount. . T V

You can still enjoy that mocha java or
Red Bull on occasion, but leave the caffeine
overload shakes behind. I

spectives from the colonies, from the suave
South to crotchety Rhode Island, exhibiting
comedic tension in the process of writing the
Declaration and with trivial matters such as
picking a national “mascot.” A

But the musical also displays a serious
tone, with a chilling song about the slave
trade and the solemn procedure of these
men signing their names on the Declaration,
essentially committing treason against the
British crown. Some of the main characters
include the eclectic Benjamin Franklin, soft-
spoken Thomas Jefferson and hot—headed

John Adams.

Actor George Merrick (John Adams) ,
stressed the fact that his portrayal of Adams
is more of a ﬁctional representation. Merrick
was more concerned with “bringing out the
drama of the script,” and said that he built
his character off that. ‘

headed, passionate patriot, Merrick felt that
the songs where he is singing to his wife,

Abigail, give the character a more sensitive

aspect.

“My favorite songs were the ones with
Abigail [Adams], because they show a dif-
ferent side  a more sentimental side to
Adams,” Merrick said. , A

Other actors, such as Steve Vinovich
(Ben Franklin), tried. to portray what they
felt their historical character had actually
been like. '

“I found out [Franklin] was a lot like me,
he liked to have a good time. He was serious,
but he enjoyed life,” Vinovich said. Through-
out the play, Vinovich gives Franklin the

‘wisdom of a sage masked beneath a facade

of frivolity, layering the personality of his
character.

These characters, among others, act as
the substance of the play because of their sig-
niﬁcant involvement in the historical event,
infusing the performance with both humor
and historical signiﬁcance. As director Ted
Pappas explained, “1776 brings history to
life in the most entertaining way and has
great roles for great actors.”

The monumental moment of the pro-
posal, creation and eventual signing of the
Declaration of Independence is brought
down to bystander level in “1776,” showing
these founding fathers not as unpolluted,

. deiﬁed beings, but as they were in reality:
‘ complex humans who put their lives on the

line by signing a piece of paper.
A As the character of John Hancock sol-

emnly states: “Very well, gentlemen. We

are about to brave the storm in a skiff made
of paper.” I

_ ,~ Senior Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

Pitt basketball as we knew it isback, and I’ve
got a good feeling about this team.

A year after suffering through missing the
NCAA tournament and the National Invita-
tion Tournament altogether, the_ Panthers

- -«iv are ripe for a late-season run. Last year, los-

ing streaks of eight and ﬁve games in the Big
East schedule left the Panthers doomed.
This year, early-season losses are a distant
memory and a midseason run has reignited
Pitt’s pride in its basketball program.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: How

'1 V‘ can we be a dominant team nationwide

without a big-time scorer? Who is Pitt’s
playmaker? 1

Well, I’ve got a newsﬂash for you. The
team doesn’t need one. Why‘? Because Pitt
has an identity. ‘

"'--‘ We have depth, and we are defensive

minded.
The Panthers, who run one of the deep-
est lineups in the country, have 10 players

suit up and 10 players see the ﬂoor each and
every game. Even Durandjohnson, the last
man on the bench, averages 11.5 minutes
and four points per game. .

Maybe it’s their depth that helps them
work as one of the most efficient defenses
in the country. I haven’t seen the Panthers
look tired once during Big East play, and that
says a lot in a league known for a grueling
bump-and-grind style of play.

But perhaps the most telling statistics
about this installment of Panthers basketball
are the team’s national rankings: seventh in
assists, fourth in assist—to-turnover ratio
and ﬁfth in points allowed per game (54.4).

Yes, you read that correctly. Pitt, who
has played six ranked opponents and fought

through a tough Big East schedule thus far, _

is ﬁfth in total defense.

To me, that shows a dedication to self-
lessness and team basketball. Even more
impressive is the presence of some freshmen
that nobody seems to be able to slow down.

James Robinson, a true freshman, is the
best in the league in assist-to-turnover ra-

tio. Steven Adams, the Big East pre—season
freshman of the year, is beginning to live up

to expectations. Through Feb. 10, he had

51 blocks on the season. For some refer-
ence, that’s seven more than the defensive
monster Gary McGhee had his senior year.

Not long ago, Pitt had lost three of four
games in the Big East — including a hap-
less effort against Rutgers — and the team
looked ready to fade. Now? Poise,"pressure,
defense. Our depth is being talked about all
over the country. We’ve climbed to No. 16 in
the polls. Talk of the Final Fourand Big East
Championships has returned.

And what better time for a team to make
a run than when the No. 1, No.-3, No. 5 and
No. 7 teams all lose within four days of each
other? And that’s without even mentioning
No. 4 Duke’s narrow and fortunate escape
against Boston College. ,

For Panther fans, this development
should be the most encouraging of all: Bas-
ketball —- at the national level —— is in some

after Conaway recorded a takedown with 25
seconds remaining in the sudden-victory
period.

Mack was visibly upset with his 5-3 loss,
and he said he knows he needs to make ad-
justments as the team hits the ﬁnal stretch
toward the NCAA tournament. D

“I feel like I didn’t wrestle to the full
potential I’m capable of,” he said. “Com-
ing down the ﬁnal stretch, it’s going to be
important to ﬁne tune and make little ad-
justments to get where I need to be come
NCAAs.”

Penn State chose to sit out usual starter
Bryan Pearsall, one of its most talented
wrestlers, and instead matched up Derek
Reber against Pitt’s Travis Shaffer at 141
pounds. ’

A takedown and six near-fall points put
Shaffer up 8-2 after the ﬁrst period, and
he rode that advantage to a 15-2 major-
decision victory.

Pitt’s Ronnie Garbnisky’s late takedown
of-Penn State’s No. 7 Andrew Alton brought
Panthers fans to their feet, but the cheers
were because the two points brought the
match to a decision victory instead of a
major decision, as Garbinsky lost, 14-7.

No. 5 Dylan Alton, last year’s third—place
NCAA ﬁnisher, continued the Penn State
winning streak with a 7-3 decision over Pitt’s
Donnie Tasser at 157 pounds. Tasser held
off many of Alton’s attempts to take him
down. The Pitt senior just couldn’t get any
offense of his own going.

The ﬁrst of three matchups between

"ranked opponents came at 165 pounds be-

tween Pitt’s No_. 13 Tyler Wilps and Penn
State’s No. 2 David Taylor. The Nittany Lions
wrestler, a two—time All-American and last
year’s NCAA champion in the weight class,
dominated Wilps for a 20-6 major decision.

The Panthers sent P._]. Tasser to the mat
at 174 pounds instead of usual starter Nick
Bonaccorsi. .

“I didn’t know I would be wrestling until
before the match,” P._]. Tasser said. “But
we prepare for every match so that if the
coaches do mix things up, we are ready.”

Tasser held his own against No. 6 Matt
Brown but, like his brother, was fstiﬂed
by tough: defense. Brown’s 10-4 victory
‘stretched the Penn-State lead to 22-4.

Penn State’s best wrestler, No. 1 Ed Ruth,
came just one point shy of a technical fall as
he defeated No. 13 Max Thomusse_it, 17-3.
The victory at 184 pounds assured a Penn
State team victory. ,

The night’s biggest match kept most of
the 3,294 fans in the house, despite the
already-determined ﬁnal outcome. Pitt’s
No. 2 Matt Wilps met No. 3 Quentin Wright.
Wilps pinned Wright in a tournament in
November.

On Friday, Wright got revenge with a pin
of his own. After Wilps started with an early
takedown, Wright countered with a single
leg that was able to roll the Panther onto his

kind of remission. Duke and UNC and Ken-
tucky and Indiana are now mere mortals,
and who to fear more than the blue~collar,
hard-nosed defensive team from Pittsburgh
with 9 faceless warriors and one giant New
Zealander?

Of course, Pitt is not without its weak—,
nesses. Free throws and layups come to mind.
Could you imagine if this team was quality
from the charity stripe? Shoot,’ it could be top
ﬁve in the country by now. On the year, they
have ﬁve losses by a combined 29 points, or
an average of 5.8. Keep that in mind when
you read this next sentence: We’ve left 174
points at the line. ‘ . . _ '

So while this team is showing some seri-
ous upside, a 66 percent shooting percent-
age from the free—throw line is still cause
for concern. '

Yet, they’re almost out of the storm. With
road tests against No. 18 Marquette and No.
25 Notre Dame coming up, Pitt has an op=
portunity to stride into the home stretch of
the season (against all unranked opponents),
collect some more wins and roll into the Big
East Championship."

Coming into the Marquette revenge game,
Pitt has won seven of its last eight and four
of its last ﬁve games on the road.

If you’re a Pitt fan out there, I’d just cross
your ﬁngers for no injuries and pray to the
free-throw gods. March can’t come soon
enough. ﬂ

back. From there, Wright was able to ﬂatten
Wilps’ shoulders and secure the pin at 2:43.
Zac Thomusseit’s victory over Lawson
was an impressive cap to a somewhat em-
barrassing match because of the wrestlers’
size difference. Lawson was much closer to
the 285 pound limit than Thomusseit.
“It’s tough wrestling guys that have a
weight advantage,” he said. “But I’m stron-
ger than them, and a majority of the time I
can out‘-scramble them.” ,
_ The tough loss to a skilled opponent will
slow the team’s momentum a little, just as
the Panthers were starting to wrestle their

‘ best matches.

“I deﬁnitely think the match lowered
our momentum.” Zac Thomusseit said. “It
wasn’t too pretty.” ~

Although the team’s morale took a hit,
the Panthers aren’t_ beating themselves up
after losing to one of the best teams in the
country. ‘ -. , P ,

“Losing is something no one likes, but
it’s a learning experience,” P._I. Tasser said.
“PSU is a great team. We will learn from it
and be ready for Lehigh next week.’’ i

The Panthers take on Lehigh in Pitt’s ‘
ﬁnal home match of the season next Friday .
