Scranton Backs Solar for Emergencies

Lt. Gov. William Scranton announced his support of solarenergy
as an alternative po_wer source in the eventofan energy emergency.
Scranton made his remarks at the annual meeting of the American
Section of the International Solar Energy Society in Philadelphia on
May 27. ' _ V

Scranton said that ‘it was necessary to make plans for_any possible
interruption in the energy supply. and that one strategy should include
“diversification and self-sufficiency." _ '

Scranton said that “solar energy is capable of competing in a free
market," but that government also has a “legitimate role in making
surelthat a market exists.” '

. Freshmen Survey Questioned      
On Security and Ethics 

By MARY KANE

Pm News Editor

A survey to determine the atti-
tudes of incoming freshmen at Pitt
was distributed at an orientation ses-
sion May l6 despite the reservations
of New Student Programs coordina-
tor Bob Firth and the College of
‘Arts and Sciences advising center.

The survey .is part of a‘ national
research effort to determinethe
effects of a college education on a
student's attitudes. Included in the
survey are questions about a “stu-
dents financial and academic back-
ground, political views, ca reer goals,
religious and personal preferenc_es.

The results will be used to com-
pare Pitt students to regional and
national norms, determine‘ their
needs to plan programs accordingly,
and provide ‘ ﬁnancial data ‘for

requests for increased state funding,

according to Mary Ann Kissel ofthe
Ofﬁce of Institutional and , Policy
Research.

Kissel added that student partici-' _

~pation was" voluntary. Freshmen’

wereasked to give their "names,
social ‘security .numbers., and
addresses for use in follow .up stu-
dies, _Kissel said. This information

’ would be stored in the Office..of
' lnstitutional and Policy St'udies_and . 
would be kept conﬁdential, Kissel: 

said. . - -

Some of the ‘survey questions‘

include;

-—_How would you characterilze, '

Neil Timm. director of informa-
tion and systems planning, said
other colleges and universities have
been using the same survey. He said
the purpose of the survey is to help
students. not hurt them. Without the
survey results, Timm said Pitt is
“stabbing in the dark" in determin-
ing areas that need improvement.

Beverly Harris-Schenz,
assistant dean of CAS, said that she
was shown a survey during the
orientation session. Harris-Schenz
said that in her opinion students
might be concerned about who
would have access to individual
answers to.questions ofa “personal
and individual nature.” .

Yeager said the Office of Institu-
tional and Policy Studies was pro-
vided the survey by the American
Council on Education, an organiza-
tion the office often works with.

The safeguards employed by ACE
involve a “link" system which stores
the homes and answers on different
tapes, with the connecting tape
stored in a foreign country. A stu-
dent's social security number and
individual results can be released to

permission, however.

Kissell said only statistics can be
released; a student’s individual
results do not become part of his
permanent record, and cannot be
released without his permission.
Kissel said she could not answer the
.question of whether a student‘s
answers would be subject to sub-
poen_a.

The advising center attached a
note to the survey reminding stu-
dents their participation is volun-
tary, and that the information would
not be made available to the advis-
ing center. Also, the number of the
Office of lnstitutional and Policy
Studies was listed for students who
had questions about the survey. The
note mentioned that the advising
center was asked to distribute the
survey by other offices in the
university.

Thirty percent of the students
responded to the survey. Yeager said

he believes the note that was attach-

ed may have been a factor in the
turnout. He added that he was

unaware Of any CLUTCH! controversy

note had been attached. Yeager said
the advising center had not
approached him with any com-
plaints about the survey. Koloc said
the advisers expressed their objec-
tions to Firth, since they were work-
ing in conjunction with him.

Yeager said the survey will con-
tinue to be distributed at orientation
sessions throughout the summer.
But if the response is consistently
low, the results will be considered
invalid and not used, he said.

Last year when the survey was
first introduced, it was informally
submitted by CAS Dean lrwin
Schulman to the Use of Human
Subjects Committee to determine its
acceptability, according to commit-
tee chairman Mark Moskowitz.

Moskowitz said the committee
first received only the questionnaire,
and decided it was unacceptable.
After the committee recieved addi-
tional information from director of
the Office of Institutional and Pol-
icy, Hilda Jones, it reversed its deci-
sion and said the rights of students
were protected, Moskowitz.

    A Question or Trust  

Recently, theAdvising Center was asked to distrib-
ute a voluntary survey by the American Council on
‘Education and Pitt. Incoming freshmen were given a
questionnaire concerning their ﬁnancial, ethnic, and
family backgrounds. Additionally, there were ques-
tions concerning political, moral, and social positions.
The disturbing doubt about the survey is not what was
presented, but what was omitted.
The survey involved highly personal questions
about topics that included sexual activity, religion,
‘personal finances, and drugs. The Office of Insitu-
tional and Policy Studies, administrators of the test,
have given very detailed explanations and purposes
-for the study. However, freshmen were not given these
explanations——only a simple and rather vague state-
ment was printed on the survey itself: “...to help
improve programs at Pitt and aid in our requests for
increased state funding. ”-While we do not doubt these
stated purposes, nor the reasons given by the Office of ‘
-Institutional and Policy Studies, we wonderif thecurt, i
‘single-sentence justification on the survey forrrritself is
sufficient rationale for the questions. First, l7- "or .
l8-year-old freshmen are asked whether they have
smoked dope, taken tranquilizers, or drank beer-—in
short, to admit if they have broken the law. They are
then asked for their name and social security number.
Then they are asked to release this information to Pitt.
But they are not told why. , ‘

lt is not surprising, then, that the surveys given in
the first round of freshmen orientation was greeted‘ by
a low (30%) response. This low result is due less to the
advisors’ skepticism concerning the survey, and more
to the intimidating nature of the questions themselves.
We trust that~.the surveys will be held in complete
confidence, but we can also understand anincoming
. student’s doubts. What assurances can be given to the.
' student about the purposes and goals of such personal
questions? is it unreasonable to ask who will have_
access to the answers, and why? An issue of trust is
_ raised here-advisors are given the already-awesome
-responsibility of guiding young men and women in
educational and career decisions—does a survey that
 questions the personal and moral attitudes of their \
‘clients threaten that trust?
A lack ‘of a—muc.h-needed explanation on the survey
forni itself has disturbing implications: perhaps the
A administrators of the test did not feel that freshmen.
were capable of understanding a more thorough state-
ment of purpose; or they felt that an explanation
would somehow damage the validity of the test;’or,
more disturbing, they felt an explanation wasnlt i
needed. All of these possibilities are mere conjecture-—
but it is conjecture raised by the unexplained vague- '
" .ness of the tests administration. ‘

‘ We hope that the surveys will benefit Pitt in pro-
gramming and state aid. But without more thorough
and clearly-stated reasons given at the time of adminis-
tration,.we cannot help but wonder about the validity

1 and ethics of the ACE/ Pitt survey.

Is Pitt Med School Deteriorating?

Dear Editor,

_ it is the best kept secret in Pitts-
burgh; the only medical school in the
city and Western Pennsylvania is
rapidly deteriorating. A decade ago
few would argue that the University
of Pittsburgh School of Medicine

.was no_t among the 20 best medical
schools in the country. But barely 2
years ago. in response to a national
survey of medical scholars that

ranked Pitt‘s medical school iii 45th,

place, the Dean at that time made
matters worse by writing a “letter to
the editor” inthe local press arguing

essentially that there were probably

only 40 medical schools that were
superior to Pitt's. Then less than
four months ago the prestigious
national LC ME that evaluates med-

ical schools gavePitt one of the low- -

est possible ratings-accreditation
for only 3 "years with probation. ~
-Fiscally and intellectually, the
Medical School is on the verge of
bankruptcy. The past decade has
witnessed -the mass exodus of tal-
ented medical scholars who have not
been replaced, resulting in a vast sea
of mediocrity. The School of Medi-
cine sits like a giant question mark
on the side of Cardiac Hill; from all
parts of the country one hears grave
reservations concerning Pitt's com-
mitment to excellence. Recruitment
of -first-rate medical‘ faculty has
become so difficult that it is hard to
find people to serve on.search com-‘
mittees. Presently, 4 out of 5 Basic‘
‘Science departmentsare without a‘
permanent chairperson—two of’
these positions have been vacant for
_nearly 6 years despite the availability
of millions of dollars from‘, founda-
tions for this purpose. No one wants
the job- because candidates have
well-founded doubts about the sta-

V‘ bility and future of the school. One

department——Pharmacology——has

been unable to recruit a chairperson’

diplomas in return for the highest
tuition for a state.supported school.

There are a number ofreasons for
the demise of..the School of Medi-
cine. University administrators like
to point to neglect on the part of
Harrisburg as the source of our
problems, arguing that the state has
not provided adequate funds to the

A Medical School. While certainly a

contributing factor, such claims
deﬂect attention from the real and
fundamental problems that exist
within the Health’Center.'

For certainly, there has been a

chronic lack of leadership over the V

years that has allowed the Medical’
School to fragment into a collection
of powerful departmentalfiefdoms
and special interest groups that are '
essentially unaccountable to the
This has resulted "in"

' unchecked, imbalanced growth that

despite the availability of L5 million '

dollars from the Allegheny Founda-

tion that now sits in escrow collect-
ing not only interest but dust. The

money went unspent for 5 years
whileithe Department of Pharma-
cology degenerated. How can this
be? Perhaps there is a conﬂict of
interest on the part of the chairper-
son of the search committee or it
may be that the Chancellor would
like to do away with the Basic
Science Departmentsin the School
of Medicine and turn the place into a
diploma mill like the ones in the Vir-
gin Islands or Guadalahara.

There are other problems. A
major affiliate-teaching hospital,
namely Montefiore, did not attract

any intern-residents to fill the I3.’

yacancies in their Division of Medi-
cine, causing many to question
whether Montefiore will be a suita-
ble place to train medical students

next year. In a related vein, although '

.the ' Health Center has attracted
-~some first-rate medical house offic-

ers in recent years, therecruitment '

' 1 of intern-‘residents has become an

increasingly difﬁcult chore; this year
there willbe more “third matched”
house officers entering the- Health
Center than is deemed desirable.-
Thus, the profound deevaluation
that has taken place in the School of
Medicine’s reputation in recent

years is making it increasingly diffi-
cult to recruit high quality faculty .

and house staff. The school has a "
~ shame to let such a precious organ

great need for new faculty with fresh

ideas,.skills. and research interests. i

Quality medical schools are not.

simply hospitals; they are institu.-.

is not in the best interests of the insti-"

-tution: For example; one" depart-

ment now accounts for more than
one-fourth _of the faculty of the
School of Medicine, a situation that
nea_rly everyone. privately deplores.
lmbalanced growth is made possible
in part by thesfact that there is no
strong, unified practice‘ plan in the
Health Center that would check the
growth of departments and funnel
funds from the clinical departments
into the Dean's office. The heads of

every one of .the l3 clinical units j

have devised‘ their own practice
plans in such a’ way as to develop
their own empiresat the expense of
the overall institution. While chair-
persons of the, clinical departments"
pour patient‘-derived dollars into

their own units,‘ the Dean of the"

School of Medicine and Vice-
Chancellor of the Health Profes-

’ sions are powerless or ineffectual in

their abilityto exert appropriate
control over revenues coming into
the Health Center. Whereas these
good doctors and scientists stand by
wringing their hands and agreeing

' that hypertrophy of certain depart"-

ments is _as unhealthy as a _50 pound

, liver and detrimentalfto the overall

well-being of the organism, nothing

Unfortunately, almost
nothing of ‘substance concerning
suchproblems is ever discussed and
debated in the_ rarified atmosphere
of the Health Center. Thereiis a con-
spiracy of silence within the Health
Center, yet nearly everyone‘ agrees
that the V“pati_ent” in question is
gravely ill. Extensive inbreeding,
stagnation. ‘ widespread acceptance

"of mediocrity and a lack of intellec-

tual integrity, have resulted in an
atmosphere where criticism, dissent
‘and debate are discouraged.

, ‘ While the very foundations of the
Medical School have turned to sand, '
the" members of the"Board of Trus-

‘tees ha-ve stood idly by, because they

lack either the insight, will. or intel-
lect to assess the present state of
affairs. Why have they not spread
the alarm or mobilized and recruited
the resources or soughtthe solutions
required to turn things around? ltis
time for them to get involved to edu-
date themselves, and to earn the
prestige that comes‘ with their
positions. M ‘.

Unreasonable _ tuition increases

Board of Trustees, and thoughtful ~

Pennsylvanians should consolidate

' story,

’ Schenley Hall, student union for the

-Student Activities Director Andy

 

 

‘ﬁlnkliﬁ Nicola built it, Enrico
Caruso slept in it, Lillian Russell
was‘ married in it, and Andy Smith
has re-designed it. It, of course, is

University of Pittsburgh. _

For 87 years it has stood like a
ﬁnely carved monolith beivs7een
Forbes Ave. and Fifth. The ten-
rust—colored structure has
changed little over time, while; the
landmarks of modern Oakland have
sprouted up around it: the Cathedral
of Learning, Hillman Library, and
Soldiers and Sailers Hall.

A Finally, it is Schenley’s turn to
change, and if all works out accord-
ing to plan, the transformation will
place it in an architectural class by
itself; an amalgam of old and new,
the rich character of the 19th century
encasing the technology of the 2l st.

On May 13, theboard of trustees
gave the university administration
authority to borrow up to $13 mil-
lion for the ren ovation of Schenley"
Hall. “And that’s the final blessing"

Smith said, as he made the sign of
the cross. _
The idea for the ren ‘ovation has

seems to be a part of the pre-history
‘of the institution. George Simmons,
d‘i‘re’ctor of facilities planning said he
has heard about it ever since he”came
to Pitt, “and I go way back.“
What was necessary to turn the

was money. A number of recent
developments have made that
money available.

First, and foremost, is the Allegh-
eny Development Authority, an

tax-exempt, the*purchasers are wil-
ling to settle for a lowerinterest rate
than what they might otherwise get
A with another type of debt instru-
' ment. The savings for -Pitt make,con-

and, vioIa,‘the renovation becomes
possible. When the authority was
created in April of 8|, the financial
aPP3|’atUS was finally in place.

The “hard planning," as it is often
called, had begun. During the

summer of I980, when The firm of ,

Williams, Trebilcock, Whitehead
Architects and Planners, Inc. was
brought in to begin drafting prelimi-
nary sketches; At. the same point,
Andy Smith, working under George
Simons, began refining the
“program?-‘

According to -Smith,‘the program
is a schedule of specifications, anda «-

description-ofneeds for the various
users of Schenley Hall. ’ V

“The program for the building has
been developed and refined by the
Student Activities staff, in coopera-
tion with’ all of the different users in
the building," Smith said, “and it has
beeen my responsibility to see that
that particular. process is
happening."

A prograrr_i,__.of sorts, existed
before Smith arived at Pitt in ’79,
but the problem was to fit the
abstract structure of the program
into the stone walls

with the ‘users of the building to
review the program. The process
went on, back and forth, untila final
plan was agreed upon. if
“It goes on until we get to a point
where we've talked about every

we went back, and we placedfevery
phone hook-up and every electrical
outlet in the building.’-’ Smith said.
. The final plan was approved. in a
review session‘ with the chancellor.
Wesley Posvar, last April.

“It was the ﬁnal sign-off,” Smith L‘

  pp   The   Inside Story
  chenley’s Turn To
Change: F inal -

said. “At that partic‘ular point we

had passed the last dead-line whefff-i:

changes could be made in the
building." .

By May II, a memo issued‘ by
George Simmons »stated that “the
project will no longer be subject to
change. This will permit final docu-
ments to move ahead without
interruption."

Along the way, a good deal offat
had been trimmed from the original
program. One casualty of the trim-

'ming process was the proposed com-

muter lounge. .

According to Smith,the idea of a§g,_._
ctfmmuter lounge was considered T

along with a variety of other facili-
ties including hand-ball courts and
saunas. But the lounge, along with
the sauna and hand-ball courts

became. “luxuries." and were .

dropped.

“A lounge is a lounge, a person
can sit and rest because we're going
to have a lounge space." Smith said,

. “but if you're talking about a place
‘where you can lie down and sleep,
 that presents security types of prob-

lems, and we found it" difficult to
defend the taking up of-that much '
square footage. ”” -L

Smith believes that much has been
done toattract, and enhance the visit
of commuting students, as well as
those that live on carnpus.

If the reality even comes close to
the plans, Schenley Hall will ‘be a
masterpiece _of ' accomodation

.between the old and‘ the’ new.

According to John ‘A. Dencler, the
head..a_rchitect on the~project,_ the-
historical motifs of the building will:
be enhaneed~while.the efficiency of
the space used is increased.

“This is a ren ‘ovation, not a res-
toration," Dencler said, “we are
designing a place for modern stu_-
dents. but‘ we are trying to maintain

)9

the ﬂavor of the old hotel as it onceﬁ I

_was. . -

The main ﬂoor will display a
majority of what was once the gran-
dure of the Schenley Hotel. The
main ballroom, site of the banquet
celebrating, the formation of U.S.
Steel, the first billion dollar corpora-
tion in history, will be refinished in
it’s original colors. The cornice work ,

the grand lobby-(where the informa,— .

loungefwill also be refinished.

‘ At least two other areas_within the
union will be restored to their old

1uster§a.suite of rooms on the fourth ' a

floor, formerly the residence of Lil-

lian Russell, and a ‘space on the sev- , ~

enth ﬂoor,,which will be used to

tures such as fireplaces, and the
nature of its occupants, the program
calls for the suite to be decorated in
oak paneling and French windows.
According to Dencler, the wood will
come from the doors to ‘offices on
the upper floors of Schenley Hall.

“When it’s finished, it will look
likeﬂa court-room, with a library,”
Andy Smith said.

Everything else, the lower level,
the rest of the main level, and every-
thing between the first and seventh
floors will be re-done, gutted, com-
pletely changed. ,

“l have never heard ofa ren ‘ova-
tion program for a student union of

Smith said. “ln the tower, they will

‘come in and knock out evry wall,
except for the elevator shaft and the
stéfrwell, so if you got up there the
day that they finish, you would be
able to look and see the outside walls
of the building."

The lower level, presently the
basement, will become the main
concourse area. Its most distinguish-
ing feature will be an atrium under-
neath what‘ is now the recreation

with a seating capacity for over 200,
and a green house cafe where Uncle
.Charlie’s is now.

The cafe will be a showcase for a

"collection of architectural antiques

from around the building, according
the Dencler.

In addition to the refinished areas
of the main level, the major innova-
tion will be a news multi-purpose

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 3, 1981

room with seating for ‘up to 700. This,
area will be used for programming

purposes, according to Andy Smith.\

On the first floor, most of the
same facilities will be retained. Off-
Campus housing will be moved up
from the basement, and the meeting
roms on the north side will be refin-
ished in a manner consistent with the
historical motif of the building.

The second ﬂoor will include the
placement center, which will be
expanded to include interview
rooms, and the chaplin’s office.

The third ﬂoor-will house the
counselling center, with an array of
facilities including a career library
and a learning skills center.

The fourth floor will be com-
pletely devoted to the student media
groups. Perhaps the most dramatic
of the modern features to be added
to Schenley Hall will be a new radio
station, which, according to Andy
Smith, has been designed for F.M.
programming.

The fifth floor is described as a
general student floor with six meet-
ing rooms and office space for
between 35 to 45 student
organizations. _

The sixth floor will be the home of
the three main student government
organizations: SGB, General Stu-
dies student government, and- the
graduate professional associations.

,Also there will be office space for
theBlack Action Society, IFC, and
Pan—hel.,

The seventh floor willbe used,
primarily as a university staff floor,
with the addition of international
student services, which are currently
located in Mervis Hall.

The top three floors will remain
the domain of the math department,
although they willhave to endure
reconstruction of_ electrical, plumb-
ing, and elevator systems. 1 A _

On paper, there is no doubt, it is a
wonderful spectacle of a building.
But a project of this size is full of
little details that have away of caus-
ing problems.. Estimates for the
completion ofthe ren‘ ovation range
from l8 months to two years, but
there are still several hurdles to be
mounted even before construction
begins. ’

The first is he bidding process. By
mid-July, the finalized program,
and the completedrdrawings will be
sent out t_o a group of at least five
contractors for bids. The bids
should be received by early Sep-

tember, and, according to George

A_ receptive bond market, an
obliging labor force, and the availa-
bility of supplies are all necessary for
the smooth running ofthe operation
when it is in this phase.

The Big Leagues

This Time Around,Lachowicz
Hopes for Offer He Ca-ngi’t Refuse

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

For a kid who should be getting a
phone call which will probably
change his life, The Phone Call that
many kids only dream about, Pitt
junior pitcher Allen Lachowicz is
taking next 'week’s major league
draft all in stride.

“It hasn’t really hit me yet," '
Lachowicz said Monday night after .

pitching seven innings for the benefit
of some scouts.» -

But then, when Lachowicz winds
up his lanky 6-3 frame and uncoils
one 'of his blurring fastballs, which
he says scouts have timed around 90
mph, not many opposing players

7-3 with Pitt this year and finished;

sixth in the NCAA final statistics in
both ERA (l.4|) and strikeouts (75
in 64 innings pitched). Such feats
draw major league scouts to his
games and make him a certainty to
go in the June 8 draft.

said. “Other than that, I haven’t

Valugh n Breaks Leg; Broz. to   G0?   t

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

Graduation isn‘t the only demon
playing havoc with the Pitt Panther
basketball team lately. Turnovers
and a fast break have spelled bad
news for coach Roy Chipman and

» his staff during the off-season.

Forward Clyde Vaughn, the
freshman shooting forward who saw
a“ great deal of action last season,
broke his leg recently and will be in a
cast for at least three_more weeks.

Clancy get selected in the second or third round of Tuesday’s annual NBA draft-

this before.

The New York Mets drafted the
righthander fresh out of Canevin
high school in I978 but Lachowicz
opted to attend Pitt instead of "the-
minor leagues. 4

“The Mets didn’t offer me a good
enough deal,” explained Lachowicz,
who arrived at Pitt as the first player
ever"to receive a full baseball‘ scho-
larship. That’s a notable piece of'tri-
via, considering coach Bobby Lewis
has sent two players, Texas pitcher
George “Doc” Medich _and third
baseman Ken Macha, now with the
Toronto Blue Jays, on to-the majors. 

“Lachowicz is up there with those
other two,"said Lewis. .

Apparently the scouts think so
too, as -they've boos_ted',the attend-J
ence at Pitt‘ games all season to eye
Lachowicz. That includes some
scouts from the Pittsburgh Pirates,

‘ who have asked Lachowicz in for a

pre-draft workout, as did Baltimore
and Cincinatti. Lachowicz will visit
the Reds this weekend.

Other teams that have expressed
interest are the Chicago Cubs,-Mets,’
Detroit, Seattle and Kansas City.

The Cubs, particularly, have been
talking to Lachowicz and acquaint— '
ing him with the state of their minor

. league pitching. At the moment, like

most other facets of the Cub team,

pick in the draft. .

Warford said the break was not .

extremely serious and expects
Vaughn to return to full strength by

That’s not all the bad news.
There’s‘ a good chance that two of
the Panthers three remaining cen-
ters from last year’s team will not be
in uniform next season due to aca-
demic problems; _

said. Although it’s extremely doubt-
ful he'll-go in the first round, Lacho-
wicz has been told by some scouts
that he’ll be picked by the third
round.

“‘Al probably has a chance to go
high. There‘s been a lot of action on
him," said Jon Neidererkassistant
scouting director for the Pirates. ‘‘I
think everybody is interested in him.
We're interested in him.”

Apparently ‘so. Neiderer, Pirate

“Al has all the tools,” Neiderer

Mention a name and Marty Blake
can usually rattle off a thumbnail
sketch of just about any collegiate
player who ﬁgures to continue his

playing career, at least in the NBA. -

Blake, ‘director of the NBA‘s
scouting bureau and a former gen-
—eral manager for several teams for l7

_ years, is generally regarded as one of

   

the league‘s top seers concerning_ the
annual ' NBA draft, which gets
underway June 9. Blake, in a tele-
phone Kconversation from his

H Atlanta office, offered some ‘inter-

esting opinions about Pitt's’ two best
hopefuls in the upcoming draft, for-
ward ‘Sam Clancy and guard Carl-
ton Neverson. .

Clancy, Pi_tt’s all-time leader‘ in_-
career rebounds, with“ 1,342 (10.6 ‘

per game), and blocked shots (170),
also ranks fourth in career scoring
. with l,67l points. Not surprisingly,
the most oft-repeated strong points.
about Clancy going into the draft
are his physical build (a muscular
6-foot-6, 235 pounds) and his defen-
sive play. '

their minor league rosters.

If Lachowicz is not happy with the
team, the round, or the deal that he’s
offered, he could return for his final
season at.Pitt, although he admits
it’s doubtful. The thought of playing
this summerin the minors in Texas

Of course, Blake knows that the

“When I was warming up, I found
a penny in right field. l still keep it in
my wallet. l figured maybe it was_
Reggie Jackson’s lucky penny or
something," Lachowicz said laugh-
ing. “But then l remembered how
rich he is-, and I thought Reggie
probably doesn’t carry any pennies
around, just bills. But l kept it
anyway." '

hinted he’s hoping to sign for at least
$30,000.

“Where or how high he’ll go
involves an awful lot of guesswork,”
Neiderer said. “He’s certainly no
secret to the major league teams, it’s
just a question of where he fits into
somebody‘s plans.”

Lachowicz said one of his most
memorable playing experiences so
far came last summer as an All-Star
selection from Allentown‘s semi—pro
team in the Atlantic Collegiate
League. Besides being named the

dency to go for big guards. He also

Pitt triple jumper Ralph Mitton
extended his string of strong late
season performances and sprinter
Darryl Baynes‘ experimental run in
the 800-meters highlighted the out-
look for next year, as the Pitt men‘s
track team closed out its season last
weekend at the Central Collegiates
meet at Michigan State.

Mitton exploded with a leap of
47-7, his third-longest careerjump,
to take third place in the triplejump.
Mitton’s collegiate best is a 48-6,
which he turned in last year as a
freshman. ln the absence of fellow
triple jumper Larry Kinney, who is
still bothered by a nagging ham-‘
string injury, Mitton has come on to
place in three of his last four meets.

ln hisifirst attempt this season in
the 800-meter run, Baynes roared to
a l:53.7, a time good enough to stir
visions of a new middle-distance‘
runner in coach Mike Agostinella‘s
head. A

“Darryl,_who has basically been a
sprinter up until now, turned in an
excellent time in the 800," Agosti-
nella said. “We’re excited about his
potential for next season.” That’s
giddy praise from a man who usually
characterizes most performances as
“pretty good" or “not bad“.

As for Baynes, he says he's also
looking forward to moving up to the
800-meter event after spending his
first two Pitt seasons mainly as a
short-distance sprinter and running‘
the first leg of the mile relay team.

‘‘I’m definitely looking forward to
the 800," Baynes said, adding he
hopes to concentrate on the 800/
“most of the time” next season and
“occasionally drop down to do
sprints once in a while," as well as
retain his role on the mile relay team.

Baynes said his time did not sur-
prise him, and added that he thinks

for Pitt, where only 6-9 sophomore
Steve Beatty, a natural forward,
returns with any experience. In a
bind, the Panthers could get help

from some incoming recruits, like _

junior college transfer Roosevelt
Kirby, supposedly an excellent
rebounder, who was previously ear- .
marked primarily as a, forward.

he can run the race even faster when
he concentrates on the distance next
year.

“l’ve been working out mainly for
the shorter distances and I entered
just to see how l’d do, and I did
well," he said. “Next year, I want to
try to run a 1:48.”

When you consider Pitt’s other
half-milers were clocked around
l:5l.2 last weekend, that’s pretty
fast.

“Yep, that‘s fast,” Baynes said.

* * * * *

Kinney, who has been bothered
by the hamstring injury for over
three weeks now, has qualified for
the NCAA track and field cham-
pionships which begin Thursday at
Louisiana State University, but
probably won’t compete, according
to Agostinella. ‘

Kinney has been steadily under-
going therapy for the stubborn
injury and has jumped just twice
competitively since the Penn Relays
on April 23.

“He hasn’t jumped in over a
month-and-a-half, and I'd hate to

see Larry hurt the leg any further," '

Agostinella said. “The trainer _said

when he lays off the leg, the injury _

will start to go away. As it is now, he
can’t get his knee up to get hisjump
off high enough.” '

*****

Speaking of injuries, Agostinella
characterized the season as a_ “pretty
good one”, but also cited the damp-
ening effect_ that injuries had on

' some individuals.

“When you look back over the
stats, I'd say this past season. went
pretty well," Agostinella said. “lt’s
just unfortunate that we suffered the
injuries late in the season.” \
