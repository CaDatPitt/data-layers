‘He says in ‘part: I

A nun MA AND mi

 Well I have played somepfootball

already. Yesterday one of the guards-
‘was hurt and the coach told me to go
_ in his place and he says that all I had;
‘to do was to. keep the other side from

hurting the center and I stood along-
side of him, and got down- on my knee
and the fellow that calls the . signals
started to yell and I saw the ban go
back and the fellowﬂopposite our cen-
ter came at him’ and‘ I gave him an-

uppercut just like when Ioknockedi
_ Rube Simp’son.fo.r_.gett.ing f,IfeSll,_\\':ilijl!‘,:-'i_’
our Mary and he fell over and then A

jumped afterpme and the whole team
started to go for ‘me and the referee.
was yellin’ and blowing a whistle like
the constaiblehas a.t the .cross roads
and the crowd started to come out of
the_ cheering sections and the police
were trying tokeep them,-back and
I was hittin left and'right and two
fellows got on top of me‘ and began
hitting me every place then I got
mad and I up and showed them what
236 lbs. was like when it was running
full steam and then after there was
about seven or eight ‘fellows laying

. around me something hit me on the

head and when I woke up I was in the
police station and the judge aint like
the constable for he didn't know. me
and when he wouldn’t letlme ‘off after.
I told! him I came from do-wn at
Hike-rtown. I ‘was going to hit him
onlythe boys told me that would -get
me into more trouble butusoon the
faculty and the.-coaches and police
that got us all‘ came in and they
talked ,with the judge and then‘ the
‘police blamed mefor all the trouble.

--and then the coach, he, got up o.n his 5

feet and he studied law at the uni-
versity a long time so -he knew how
to act and he was telling them about
me‘ being so ignorant of football and

how I came from the country and
‘did not know how to play the game

and..t_l1at would the judge -please ex-
cuse me as their should. -be no pun-
ishm_ent for the feeble minded and so

after along time the coaches -got

their teams’ out of theplaee and I
think ourecoach ought to be a lawyer
like rm going to -be——ca.use he was
just ki-dldin the judge about me -_be-
ing all that as I am the biggest ‘fel-
low in the bunch and_ I -could lick
any of them. I’ll write soon again.

Work of Melloo Institute A    
Praised by.iLoca1 ,Papeirs

‘ Publication ‘of the -annual report
of the Mellon Institute of Industrial
Research of ‘the University was the
occasion’ forW several ‘ editorials in
Pittsburgh newspapers which-praised
the work and discoveries made by
fellows there. ‘i A
The editorial in The Pittsburgh
Press, titled,‘ “An Institution Pitts-
burgh is proud Of,” follows: . I
One. of the ‘most thoroughly mod-
ernist .institutions in.. the United
States is the Mellon Institute of In-
dnstrial Research, University of
Pittsburgh, whose annual report, pre-
sented 'by the‘ directors,"Dr. E. R.
Weidlein, is made pulblic today. Al-
though a- Pittsburgh benefaction . as
far as origin’ is concerned, its bene-
ﬁts have no- local nboundaries but
reach all America if not all- mankind.
As Dr. Weidlein states, the insti-
tute is a center for technical inves-
tigation in chemistry and in subjects
allied to it for the purpose of. the
discovery and deveiopment of new
materials and‘new processes._ The
.world is only on the threshold of the
establishment of a true and com-
prehensive scientiﬁc method in in-
dustry, and even the boldest may
hesitate to set l‘i:mits*to the achieve-
ment that is possibleiin this direc-
tion. ‘The fellowships associated with
the institute permit experiment and
research by men of proved ability
under ideal circumstances that assure
albundant result. Although not old
in years the Institute. has "already
made a noteworthy contlgibution to
industrial progress. Pittsburgh is
proud to have given such an institu-
tion to the country. _ i «
Under the caption, “Wonders in the
‘Commonplace,”" the following edi-
torial appeared in the Pittsburgh
Post: -

thing.”_ ' 4 _ -I v
The microscope longago impresse
upon us there is nothing so com-
monplace as to be without some won-
der. While trees, running brooks and
rocks may never fail ‘to’ excite the
interest of the real nature lover, ar-
tist or poet, to some long associated
with them they may become “coni-

-ing with the things-. of prosaic in-
dustry or common affairs of life. The
point, however, islthat the part now
being played in ordinary "business
by. chemists leaves practically noth-
ing about industrial pursuit today
common or dull. Reports of fellow-‘
ship 'work‘of the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research of the University
of Pittsburgh are making even some
of the _‘‘ordinary” things‘ of the
ki-tchen and the laundry take on al-
most fascinating. interest. As for
bI‘ead-baking,
thrilling labaratory achievement.
Reviewing the -institute’s work for
the past year, it is set forth that it
covers a range from perfume to fer-
tilizer and that numerous technome-
chanical inventions resulted from the
investigations by the.-* 75 follows, for
which 35 United States patentswere
issued. The mere reading of the fol-
lowing list of “notable investigations"
sets theiniagination to work on ‘the
interesting results and possi-bi-lities
of ‘study of, “ordinary” things: . Phys-
ical properties of glass, bread tech-.
nology, chemistry of petroleum, nat-'
ural gas, dental cements, ﬂotation
ores, refractories, by-product coking,
ﬁber containers, heat insulation, glue,

insecticides, food -and beverage ﬂa-V
vors, inks,-protracted metals, sulphur,

galvanizi-ng,.. ﬁsh products, salts, as-'
bestos, ozone and roofing. No matter
how frequently We may have heard
the purpose -of the. institution de-
scribed, there is interest .in hearing
it . again. Speaking of it; Director
Weidlein says: ,
“The institute is a center for
technical investigation in chemis-
try and in , subjects allied to it.
Its purpose is to’ promote indus-
trial success through scientiﬁc re-
search; to ﬁnd new materials and
new processes for industrial de-
velopment _and' to advance manu-
facturing through the application
of scientific" methods _to industry.” _
As -science also __is being applied to
farming, every branch of industry, in
addition to beingmade more efﬁctent,
also is bound to be made more in-
teresting. .

Great wonders may beirevealed to,

us by the telescope inthe study of
the heavens; there never should be
neglect of astronomy—of any ﬁeld
that may enlarge or enrich our knowl-
edge, and what one will not? Mean-

while we must keep in mind ‘Dr. Rus-S .

sel -H." Conwell’s famous lecture‘ on
,”.A<3I'eS of Diam’onds”~"'t\he wonders
and} riches that may be lying ‘an’

Against ‘Lafayette

 

’ I With thef-Lafayette game oﬁ‘ of the
way Coach Vvarner has \only_a few
days in whiclrto prepare for the next
hard test-—the game with West Vir-
giniaat Forbes Field next Saturday.
The‘ Mountaineers are -certain to be
at their tip-top form for. the game
with Pitt, and.Pitt can expect all that
Coach “Fat? Speer can send against

two overwhelming 'v.ictories.— Pitt
must not forget that last-year’s game
with the West Virginia_team was not
an easy one and was only won by a
touchdown, the ﬁnal score being 21
to 13. The West Virginia team is fast
becoming a great eleven "under the
leadership of the former ‘Dartmouth
Mentor and each year the Snakes’
bring ;a stron-gen team with a re-
newed‘de.terminati'on to turn; the tide
of defea,t~ and \break. the long string
of _defeal;s which Pitt has handed
‘them.  P i

_. _Tl'ie showing that Pitt made ‘against
-Lafayette "isaturday presents some

PITT Louis AllEAll,  i 
Tl] sinicusiliiilia

- Saturday weal; the Pitt Panther takes

 

with the big. Orange team. Two years 5;
ago the Panther was held to a 7-7 tie 
at the Salt -city, but last year Pitt‘,
completely turned the tables and 
handed Syracuse a. 35-0‘ ‘defeat at.“
Forbes Field. - A S,‘

Last Saturday Coach Meehan’s_ team“ '’

defeated Tom Thorpe’s New York City :'
University team 32-0, at Syracuse. 2 ‘

Some idea of the strength of the

Orange team" can be gotten from the-5
fact that it scored 23 points in the I ’

quarter. and they‘ were only twelve
minute quarters at that.
easily be seen that Syracuse will be
no easy foe, and that the Panthers
will have to put in some very stren-. .
uous efforts in the next ten days it

 
 

they are to return victorious.- Notl1_- 

   
   

ing would please Isyracuse. more than A
to defeat Pitt and thus atone for tlieiii V .
showing at Pittsburgh last fall.
is ‘no secret that Syracuse is very
eager to take the Panther’s hide into

camp and they will leave nothing un- 

done in their effort to atone for last
year's overwhelming defeat.
