Ballots For ODK
Nominees Today

Eight Juniors Supervise Boxes
In University Election
For Revived Award

Voting Closes At 3:30

Senior men in undergraduate
schools, Pharmacy and Dentistry
vote today in the ODK Senior
Award election. Yesterday after-
noon School of Medicine last—year
men cast their ballots.

Students in the School of Busi-
ness Administration, Education, En-
gineering, Mines and the College may
vote at a central polling booth on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of Alumni hall, from 9:30

Kelly Announces
Chorus Survivors

Cap, Gown Dancers. Named After
Difficult Three-Day Practice

Stage-door Johnnies had better dust
off their little red books and start
checking dates with the “femmes” of
the Cap and Gown chorus right now.
Dates for the week of April 22 will
be hard to get, since Gene Kelly, “In
the Soup” dance director; has complet-
ed eliminations for the chorus of the
new musical comedy, selecting the
most beautiful men on the campus as
key chorines.

Kelly made his announcement of the
ﬁnal eliminations yesterday morning
after holding intensive practices
throughout the ﬁrst three days of the
week. _

The bevy of beauties who will dis-
play their charms for Cap and Gown
audiences is as follows:

Ralph L. Appel, Ben W. Baskin,
Harry L. Boyd, William L. Collins,
\Villiam Davis, Stephen L. Goodale,
Stephan Hoyt, Roland Lees, James
Lavine. Robert G. Luskin, Jolm W.
Mills, Oliver D. Montgomery, Charles

N. Perriue, Dan Ripley, Arnold D.
Rub-onstein, Simpson Schechter,

Charles B. Simmon, J. Edgar Spitz,
Dan Thompson, and Harry Zinsser.

The complete “female” dancing
chorus will consist of 16 key men, the
remaining four acting as alternates.

Gene also announced the “Astaires.”
“Robinson.” and “Bolgers,” who will
make up the male chorus. They are:

Charles E. Allcroft, Wilbur L. Baer.
Andrew J. Barchﬁeld, J. Bernard
Block, Robert Bowdler, Irving L.
Braun, George Golanty, Chris Her-
ron, Charles Johnson, Alfred L. Levon-
son, Charles J. McCreadv, Michael
Metrock, Lee R. Reister, Stanley E.
Roseubloom, Vvilliam C. Shaeffer,
James Thompson, George Watt, Paul
J. ‘Whitaker. Robert B. Willison; and
S. Jack Zroba.

The complete male chorus will al-
so consist of 16 regulars withifour
alternates. .

In commenting on his selections for
the chorus, Kelly said:

‘‘I’m sorry that I couldn’t ﬁnd a
spot in the show for everyone who
tried out. The show, however, to be
a ‘hit’ must exclude all but the best
available talent. Several applicants
who displayed real dancing ability
had to eliminated on other counts,
such as too much weight, football
legs. or muscled torsos.”

{All men interested in singing in
the octet should ﬁle their names with
Mr. Biddle, Room 801, Cathedral, im-
mediately. There are openings for
tenor voices.

|l:'s Our Treat
From Now On

Beginning on Monday, every
issue of The Pitt News will be
just so much more gravy to its
readers.

For today, The News tucks
away under its belt the 58th is-
sue since its tri-weekly policy,
a number equal to the total
published last year under a
semi-weekly system.

By March 9 last year, the
University’s oﬁicial student
publication had reached the 36-
mark. Files of three years ago
show that only 22 issues had
been published by the same
time then.

’Vv'ay back there, The News
was called The Pitt VVeekly. It
published 34 issues a year.

47 Manuscripts
To Be Published
In ‘Journeyman’

Fifty-one pages of prose and poetry,
in a cover designed by Fine Arts As-
sistant Professor Philip -C. Elliott, The
Journeyman arrives from the printer
tomorrow and will go on sale on cam-
pus Monday.

The University’s ﬁrst literary mag-
azine in two years has been harvested
from a crop of more than 200 1nanu-
scripts, according to Maxine Hirsch,
C35, president of Quill club. Forty-
seven manuscripts, of which slightly
more than half are poetry, were ﬁnal-
ly culled for publication.

The book opens with “Evening
Again,” a short story, and includes
among its featured articles: “Art-
Survival or Death?” by Herrymon
Maurer; “Midnight Mass,” by Alice
E-lson; “Proleta.rian,” by Edward Kal-
berer; “Shanghai,” by Grace Yee
Quil; “I VVill Not Kill a Man,” by Ed-
win Banks; “On Darkness,” by Robert
Slack; and “Y0 Ho!” by Alan Lloyd.

An editorial explains the purposes
of the magazine and asserts:

“Whether writing from perplexity
or from realization, college students
have something to say to one another,
and they should be given a constant
opportunity to say it.”

City Government
Upheld By Kane

Councilman Sees No Necessity
For City Manager Plan

There is no necessity for changing
the type of city government in Pitts-
burgh.

This is the opinion of John J. Kane,
city councilman who discussed “The
mayor or city manager plan” at‘ the
weekly meeting of Inquiry forum held
Wednesday.

Under the city manager system the
people would elect the nine members
of city council who in turn would hire
a city manager to carry out the execu-
tive duties.

In regard to this system, Mr. Kane
said: “Although something should
be done to better the city govern-
ment, the operation of government is
purely an administrative proposition,
and I don’t believe the substitution of
a city manager for the mayor would
improve conditions one iota.

“There is some corruption in every
administration and what we want is
a business government, not a business
men’s government. Behind every pub-
lic oﬁicial there is some business man,
who, in his attempt to buy legisla-
tion, has corrupted him.”

Commenting on the administration
of Mayor McNair, Kane, (who ap-
peared to be fully in favor of the
Ripper bill) declared:

“He was elected on the Democratic
ticket and if he had attended to busi-
ness would be one of the outstanding
men in the party today. However, he
has hindered the functions of govern-
ment, and I don’t approve of his tac-
tics. He has got to be removed.”

SENIOR BALL PETITIONS

Petitions for the chairmanship of
the Senior Ball "are available today at
the dean of men’s office. The deadline
for their return is Thursday at 5
o’clock.

Reich, Tumpson,
Willison Chosen
Festival Leaders

Chairmen For Week’s Activities
Named Following Interviews
With SFA Committees

Robert Willison, BA35, Marjorie
Reich, C35, and Ellis 'l‘umpson, BA36,
have been awarded the three chair-
manships of Spring Festival week.
Willison and Miss Reich will be gen-
eral chairman and coed chairman, re-
spectively, of the week’s events, and
Tumpson will be in charge of the an-
nual Festival sports dance.

These appointments culminated a
week of interviews by the Appoint-
ments committee of SFA. Six seniors
and one junior were referred by them
to the Executive committee for inter-
views. Besides those selected, the
following were considered; Marion
Epping, BA35, and Helen Milliron,
C35, for coed chairman; Leslie VVilk-
ins, C35, for general chairman; and
Sylvan Little, BA35, for chairman
of the Spring Festival Dance which
concludes the activities of the week.

I/Villison was chairman of the Inter-
fraternity Conference day last year,
was business manager of the Interfra-
ternity Ball in January, is on the pub-
licity staff of the coming Military Ball,
and has served on numerous other
committees on campus. He is a mem-
ber of Delta Tau Delta, a11d was presi-
dent of the fraternity last year. VVil-
lison is the third consecutive Delt to
serve as Spring Festival chairman.

Miss Reich is an associate editor
of The News, a member of Mortar
Board, women’s national senior hon-
orary activities fraternity, WSGA ex-
ecutive committee, Senior Court,
Senior class cabinet, Xylon, women’s
honora.ry journalism fraternity, and is
a member of the nominating commit-
tee for Senior Queen. She does not
belong to a social fraternity.

Tumpson, business manager of The
News, and a non-fraternity man, is a
member of ODK, and was a Druid.
He is the ﬁrst junior in recent history
to receive this chairmanship-.

All three executives expect to com-
plete committee personnel shortly.

The Spring Festival will extend
from ‘Wednesday through Friday, May
S to 10. In the past the activities
of the week have included Inter-

, fraternity sweepstakes, women’s--fra-

ternities’ ﬂoat parade, women’s sports
events, honorary activities tap day,
and the concluding dance. This year
in addition to the tapping ceremonies
the recipient of the Senior Queen
award, and the ODK award will be
announced at the exercises.

Speaight To Give
"Dickens Program

Pickwickian Figures ‘Interpreted
By Actor Here Monday

Charles Dickens’ David Copperﬁeld
will grace the University for the ﬁrst
time Monday when Frank Speaight,
famous British actor, comes to speak
here under the auspices of‘Pitt Play-
ers. He has called his program “An
afternoon of Dickens’ humor,” in
which he will draw his sources from
“Pickwick Papers,’ and “David Cop-
perﬁeld.”

Speaight’s fame has grown nation-
wide during his tours of. America. On
his past trips he has addressed uni-
versities and colleges in almost every
state in the Union, spoken to women’s
clubs and organizations from New
York to California; and made per-
sonal appearances in ﬁve theaters.
Wherever he has gone, enthusiastic
press reports have cited his rendition
of Dickens’ work, “miraculous.”

He does his renditions without
scenery or costume; recreating the
famous Dickens characters in almost
the author’s own words. His program
assumes the proportions of a drama,
with Speaight ﬁlling all the principal
roles. To build his programs, he has
had to dramatize the works of Dick-
ens, yet he has omitted no essential
part of any plot, and even recreates
the background through his mono-
logues.

The program will begin at 2:30
o’clock in Heinz House. Students and
faculty members are invited. There
will be no charge.

SWank’s Show Of ‘Pure Photography’
Includes City, Circus, River Life Prints

 

by e. pickering

-“Pure photography” is an offspring
of the general line of photographic
endeavor. It is pictures made from
unmanipulated negatives; that is, free
from any retouching, adding, or cut-
ting out of the contents of the original
negative. Such is the nature of Luke
Swankfs one man exhibit in the Gulf
Galleries of the Gulf building. Luke
Swank is considered one of the coun-
try’s greater photographers, probably
the best in the city. He is the Univer-
sity’s official photographer and in-
structor in journalism photography.

Approximately 30 prints dealing
mainly with circus lifc, city life and
river boats comprise the show. All
are projection prints on paper com-
monly known as glossy. Glossy gives
better definition in details and is the
most diﬁicult paper to use for beauty
and softness. That the pictures are
especially attractive and appealing is
tribute to the technical excellence in

\

their handling. It is not Swank’s ﬁrst
attempt at this type of work by any
means.

Last summer in the ﬁrst annual
salon of pure photography in San
Francisco 600 prints were entered.
Fifty-seven were chosen; ﬁve were by
Luke Swank.

Commenting on this show John
Paul Edwards wrote in the Septem-
ber issue of Camera Craft maga-
zine, “Five photographs of Pitts-
burgh by Luke Swank, measure up
as the best individual group of the
exhibition. Technically splendid,
interesting in subject matter and
point of view, this is a truly splen-
did work.” Other of Swank’s works
have been exhibited in salons in
many principal cities and prominent
galleries.

The present Pittsburgh exhibit is
an entirely new set of pictures, for
Swank never shows the same print

16 Grams T:Tap
At Scholar’s Day

Princeton English Head Named
Speaker For Next Friday

Dr. Hoyt H. Hudson, chairman of
the English department of Princeton
university, will be the principal
speaker at Scholar’s day, a week from
today. The subject of the address
will be “The life of the student.”

Dr. Hoyt, a member of Delta Sigma
Rho, was professor of English at the
University from 1925-27. He is a
graduate of Huron college and holds
a Ph.D. from Cornell university. He
has taught at Swarthmcre and Cornell.
For the last three years he has been
editor of the Quarterly Journal of
Speech, a publication for students of
public speaking. During the last year
he has been doing investigative work
at the Huntington library in Pasadena,
California.

Although Dr. Hudson has written
books and magazine articles on pub-
lic speaking, his ﬁeld of study has
been Renaissance poetry.

John Torrence, C35, is in charge of
arranging the affair. Tapping into
honorary scholastic fraternities will
follow the address.

New members will be tapped by the
following 16 honorary groups: Beta
Gamma Sigma, business administra-
tion; Chi Rho Nu, pre—medical; Col-
lembolae, natural science; Delta Sig-
ma Rho, forensic; John Marsliall, pre-
law; Kappa Phi Kappa, men’s educa-
tion; Phi Alpha Theta, history; Phi
Lambda Upsilon, chemistry; Pi
Lambda Theta, women’s education; Pi
Sigma Alpha, political science; Pi
Tau Phi, college; Quax, women‘s sci-
ence; Quill club, literary; Sigma
Gamma Epsilon, mining; Sigma Kappa
Phi. foreign languages; Sigma Tau,
engineering.

Chi Rho Nu To Tap

Chi Rho Nu, honorary pre-medical
fraternity in the College, conducted a
rushing smoker Vvednesday to which
25 prospective members were invited.

John Heid, C37, president, an-
nounced that a limited number of men
will be tapped to membership on
Scholar’s day next Friday.

Cathedral Towers-
Memorial Delves

From top to bottom, the Ca-
thedral of Learning stretches
downward 42 stories; when the

Foster Memorial building is
completed it will reach only
four stories. And yet . . .

foundation work for the Memo-
rial will have been sunk a few
feet deeper than that of the Ca-
thedral.

It’s a matter of topography,
says Business Manager John
VVeber, and a. matter of having
lounge and dressing facilities in
the Memorial a ﬂoor below the
street-level auditorium. It’s not
structural necessity. The Ca-
thedral lawn, on which the Me-
morial is being built, slopes
about 25 "feet from Fifth avenue
to Forbes street, causing this
peculiar architectural situation.

I-F Council Will 0
Be Reorganized

Constitution Drawn Up- By Wills’
Committee Is Final One

“An Interfraternity Council by the
second week of April,” predicts N.
Robert Seidle, assistant to the dean of
men, and adviser to CPSF, which has
had a committee working on the re-
establishment of an I-F Council‘ here.

At a meeting of the CPSF Tuesday
night, draft of a constitution for
such a council drawn up by a com-
mittee under James Wills, C35, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, was practically ac-
cepted along with some minor re-
visions,

Also, plans for a radically different
system of fraternity rushing to be-
come effective next fall were consid-
ered by the 13 fraternity presidents
in CPSF, but no deﬁnite action has
been taken as yet.

Both the IF Council constitution
and the rushing rules revision report,
the latter originally submitted by a
committee under Henry George, E35,
Pi Kappa Alpha, had been read in
previous CPSF meetings and taken
to the various ‘member fraternities for
discussion and suggestions. The re-
ports now go balk to their committees
and .th.e...ﬁna.l-draf.ts.-atszill.Jae.-r.eturned..
to the houses for ratification within a
few weeks.

In the constitution, provisions for
election of officers by the Hare sys-
tem of preferential ballot were ac-
cepted by a 10-1_ vote, with two
houses not reporting. Election of of-
ficers has been the greatest thorn in
the peace of I-F Council in previous
years, and caused the complete break-
down of that body last spring.

A clause in the suggested rushing
rules calling for a preliminary four-
day restricted period, followed by a
week of open rushing, was generally
regarded unfavorably, the presidents
suggesting that rushing be either re-
stricted throughout, or open through-
out.

The meeting took place at the Phi
Gamma Delta house. with Chairman
Leslie-Wilkins; C35, Delta Tau Delta,
presiding.

SFA Abandons Newsreel
After Third Attempt Fails-

SFA’s venture into the theatrical
business has come to an end. The
campus newsreel, presented under
SFA sponsorship for three consecutive
weeks, will not be shown again. The
last showing was seen at the Schen-
ley theater on VVednesday by an audi-
ence of slightly over 300 students.
Since there was no appreciable in-
crease in attendance over previous
showings, and because of the expense
involved in presenting the ﬁlms, mem-
bers of the SFA Executive committee
decided to drop the project.

General Training
For Engineering
Students Planned

Varied Subjects To Be Offered.
In New Non-Specialized
Technical Courses

 

 

Innovation In Education

 

A four-year course in general
eng-ineering—an innovation in
American education——wi1l be of-
fered by the University beginning
next semester, Dean E. A. Hol-
brook of the School of Engineer-
mg announces today.

Present collegiate
courses, the dean points out, offer only
specialized curricula in such ﬁelds as
industrial, chemical, mechanical or
civil engineering. Under the new
plan, a broader training in more var-
ied subjects will be stressed.

Three-fourths of engineering grad-
uates throughout the country, Mr.
Holbrook says. use their training in
hundreds of other ﬁelds for which
such a background is necessary, The
general course has been added, he in-
dicates, for better preparation of these
men.

For the degree in the new course,
135 credits will be required. Of these
50 are in engineering, 65 in liberal
arts, 14 in business administration,
and 6 in mines. A total of approxi-
mately 30 electives in any field will
be permitted.

“The School of Law and the School
of Medicine,” Mr. Holbrook declares,
“have indicated that this course, in-
cluding appropriate elective selection,

is a satisfactory pre-legal or pre-
medical D1‘og_13Lm. In general, the

course is offered with the belief that
a combination of the rigid studies in
science and engineering with a wide
choice of liberal arts electives offers
a college training ﬁtting the graduate
to live well in the modern world.”

A block schedule will be followed
in the freshman year. Number of elec-
tive permitted in the next six semes-
ters will be increased, with a maxi-
mum of seven in the second half of
the junior year.

Ear1eWill‘"G_r_eet  
Student Conclave

Secretary Of State Lawrence To
Open Harrisburg Meeting

Governor George Earle and David
Lawrence, secretary of the Common-
wealth, will open the Student Legis-
lative conference at ll-Iarrisbnrg, April
6-8, according to Genevieve Blatt, C33,
director.

The student body will sit as a
model unicameral legislature in
which representation will be propor-
tional to committees. Caucuses of
the following committees will pre-
sent reports to the legislature: local
government, social legislation, judi-
cial reform, taxation and ﬁnancial re-
form, and further constitutional
changes.

Richard J. Beamish, Lawrence's
predecessor, addressed the model con-
stitutional convention last year.

“I hope that a permanent organiza-
tion ‘will be formed because from
my experiences as a newspaperman
and as a state official, I have found
that students forecast governmental
changes of the future,” said Mr.
Beamish.

The executive committee is made
up of one delegate from each of 29
charter schools. The arrangements
committee is subdivi_ded into state-
wide publicity, secretarial, and en-
tertainment groups.

Speaker Believes Socialized Medicine
Inevitable; Advises Deﬁnite Program

“Doctors are doing socialized medi-
cal work today, only they aren’t get-
ting paid for it.”

Thus said Morris E. Harwood,
Med35, in an address before the Pre-
med club at the YMCA hut Wednes-
day, under the sponsorship of Chi R0
Nu. honorary medical fraternity.

“The medical profession should real-
ize that some sort of socialized medi-
cine is bound to come,” the speaker
said. “It should plan some deﬁnite
program to meet the situation and not
leave it to the politicians.”

Citing the majority and minority re-
ports from the Committee on the Cost
of Medical Care report, which was the
result of a ﬁve-year survey conducted
by medical men, laymen, and social
scientists, Harwood argued that since
public sentiment is obviously for some
form of state medicine; the doctors
themselves should be the ones to pro-
mulgate the program and not leave it
to legislators.

The majority recommendations
were: 1. Medical care by group
clinics. 2. Extension of public health
services. 3. Bearing costs of medical

care by taxation or insurance. 4.
Careful medical planning. 5. Certain
changes in educational emphasis.

The minority report had seven parts
which were conservative in tone, pre-
senting a more or less negative set of
recommendations.

The speaker presented both sides
of the question. The objections which

would be voiced by that body of the
profession against socialized medi-
cine, “that state medicine would
seriously injure the income of the
general practitioner” and that ﬁnan-
cially able people would “try to‘ get
medical care without paying for it,”
were presented in detail.

Contrasting this the speaker brought
forward the attitude of the other side.
Statistics show that certain chronic
diseases are deﬁnitely on the increase
and that some provision must be made
to take care of these people. When
these people are unable to pay these
costs themselves, this charge must be
paid by someone—in this case, the
state.

“The main point is that socialized
medicine is inevitable,” he continued.
“The trend in everything shows that
people want social legislation of some
kind or other. If the medical profes-
sion does not want political inﬂuences
to shape the program, it should get.
together and frame a platform that
will best answer to the requirements
of both parties. ‘Since the ﬁeld is
medicine and doctors know most about
it, why should they leave it to poll-
ticians?”

According to Harwood, a. great num-
ber of doctors are doing clinical work
today and are not getting paid for it.
“If they could get paid for doing this
work and have a private practice on
the side, there should be no serious
objection.”

Engineers Become Cultured

DECISION by the School of Engineering to offer

a general course next year in “Engineering,”
as distinguished from “Chemical Engineering,”
“Civil Engineering,” “Electrical Engineering,”
and the like, will be watched with interest by
other universities. The School seems to have
struck a pioneering thought.

Never at this University, at least, has it been
possible for a student to study the subject of engi-
neering broadly if he wanted to. And here and
elsewhere, engineering students have settled down
to intensive learning in one department of the
ﬁeld, after perhaps a few stimulating lectures on
the broader aspects by the dean.

Now engineering students may have the option
of learning as much as the dean knows about the
broader aspects, and—by selected courses in the
Collegc——as much as a B.A. knows about the arts.
The idea is sympathetic to the general abandon-
ment of professional training in undergraduate
courses. Years ago we demanded a broad back-
ground of training for students of medicine. Stu-
dents of the law must now show four years of col-
lege work and a degree, and young theologians
take B.A.’s and study Greek.

Just as the strong movement toward specializa-
tion was a product of the boom ’tweiities, so the
reaction marks the ’thirties. In those days, if you
came out of college with all the answers in your
head that you were likely to need in building coke
ovens, pulling teeth or selling bonds, you doffed
-your cap and gown in a jiﬁfy and took a job at $35
a week to start. Now that the jobs are fewer,
several adjustments are possible.

Hitler’s adjustment is to ban Jewish students
from higher technical education and to severely
limit the number of candidates for advanced in-
formation. A strictly “bull moose” suggestion is
to retire every worker over 40 and to give his job
and emoluments to some ambitious graduate. An
alternate of this plan calls for “those over 40 to
be knocked over the head,” a method which has at
least the advantage of avoiding racial and relig-
ious discriminations.

In America we prefer to offer a broadened sur-
vey of technology and society to candidates for
this troubled world. And perhaps this way we
may stumble into democracy.

Inaudible Art

ONE OF THE BRIGHT young men of scientiﬁc
research has offered the National Theater Con-
ference a method of making every new play an
emotional success, as far as an audience is con-

cerned, and of turning every Broadway hack into

a potential Euripides.

By the use of low organ tones, “so far down
that you can actually feel them rather than hear
them,” a Stevens Tech professor wants to eﬁect
cold or warm moods in his theater audiences. In-
deed, any elfect that a dramatist wants in his play
is guaranteed. Says he:

“A series of grating noises, totally unheard,
can make one feel as though his teeth were
chattering, ‘or can even make one break into a
perspiration for no obvious cause. All the
symptoms of fear or joy can be obtained. So
great is this power that a theater balcony can
be made to jump up or down.”

If the theater balcony could not remain unmoved

The Pitt News

before the new inaudible emotion, neither could
the theater audience, probably; and the effective-
ness of art might eventually depend on how strong
the ﬁre marshal found the peanut gallery. The
opportunities which the idea offers to a weak play
are obvious. That dull stretch in the ﬁrst act be-
comes an artistic triumph, as the manager calls to
the switcli-boy:
“Joe, give them a shot of Visceral Pathos
4X.”

Joe plunges a switch, and the audience is racked
to the necessary degree of abdominal contraction.
Their teeth chatter, and they break out into per-
spirations for no obvious cause. When the curtain
rings down, they applaud from emotional relief—-
or perhaps “Applause” is a number on Joe’s
switchboard—and they go home feeling as if they
had stoked locomotives for twelve hours.

In time, theater managers would ﬁnd it more
proﬁtable to discard the play itself and to set the
audience before a vacant stage and a super subtle
switchboard. The audience would sit wrung with

pity and fear on Mondays,- Vlfednesdays and Fri-S

days; with laughter on otlierevenings and at mat-
inec performances. Eventually the thing would be
more popular than the movies, since even less in-
telligence would be necessary to enjoy it.

Thus science remakes the world, and the theater
defends itself against the wonderful cinema.

A Private Fight?
‘C E ALL BELIEVE in academic freedom,”

said a incmber of the resolutions committee
of the National Educational Association last week,
“but we don't feel it ourbiisiiicss to ﬁght any-
body’s private war. It ’s just a ﬁght between the
Hearst papers and the Columbia University
group.”

If so, the Columbia University group should
have immediate reinforcements from Americans
who seek to escape academic st.raight-jackets and a
coerced society during‘ the last years of capitalism.
To the threat of these things The Columbia Spec-
tator points in the following editorial:

The Way Is Paved

Those who maintain a neat and wistful iso-
lation from dynamic moveinciits in this coun-
try will derive scant optimism from Professor
Franz Boas’ observations yesterday on the pos-
sibilities of success of an organized chauvinist
movement in America. His statements are the
more deserving of inspection since they come
from the founder of modern anthropology.

The isolated, and particularly the American
isolated, keep up their spirits on all occasions
by declaring that “America is different,” ve-
hemently condemning the racial orgies of Hit-
lcrisin while holding that similar feats woul.d
be “inconceivable” in the United States, even
under the worst conditions.

Such feats are not “inconceivable,” for they
are part of our history.

Hitler had only two hates to exploit when
he took the German people in hand: anti-Semit-
ism and the well-conditioned belief in the
“superior cultural mission” of the Tcutons.
He could depend only on madinen like Goeb-
bels to make his theories “scientiﬁc;” few
scientists of any recognized merit came to his
assistance. But he did the job.

America is a greater nation. Here we have
a strong nationalist spirit, continually re-
enforced by the Hearst-ians in press, pulpit,
schoolroom and radio; in the “Test, “a funda-
mental feeling against the J apanese;” in the
South, the notorious anti—Negro sentiineiit,
which in the violent forms it has taken has
made our country famous throughout the
world; there is rampant anti-Semitism; the
growing strengtli of the Ku Klux Klan testi-
ﬁes to the potency of its anti-Catholic appeal.

Our future Hitler will have a glowing op-
portunity. Thc way is prepared, and when
the economic situation becomes intolerable, the
violent, barbarous liatc—drive that this country
will witness——if anti-war and anti-fascist
movements do not act swiftly———will surpass
anything civilization has yet seen.

And there will be scicnt.ists——scholars of re-
pute, occupying high academic chairs, lectur-
ing to impressionable and discontented young
people, churiiing out books, utilizing our high-
ly developed publicity and advertising organ-
ization——to make American chauviiiism authen-
tic. Professor Boas inentioiied a few of them.

Yes, there is great hope for America—an
extremely one-sided hope for the vicious “pa-
triots” who will burn civilization on the altar
of self-interest.

The alternative to destruction is a weary
one and far from joyful in the getting; it
means persistent struggle, organization, agita-
tion. But the stakes have never been higher.

What a Course

A job open and nobody to ﬁll it be-
cause all petroleum reﬁning graduates
are working—t1iere’s a story for you,
United Press.

The department today has on ﬁlef
a letter from the Heath Reﬁning
company. Gladewater, Texas, asking
for a petroleum reﬁning graduate in
or before the 1933 class. It reads in
part:

“He may or may not-have had
practical experiences. We would
prefer a young. man with no phys-

ical defects. Please state salary
expected.”
The department is up against a

stone wall. Every graduate before
1934 is working. It expects some may
want to change positions, however,
and apply for this job.

Dr. Raymond L. Abel, head of the
(lepartnient, said:

“This is not unusual. All thro_ugh
the depression there have been more
openings for mining engineers and
petroluem refiners than students to
fill them.”

 

“Fore!”

D1‘. Mont R. Gabbert, head of the
philosophy departmeiit, stands some-
what above six feet. He uses this
height to good advantage in bowling.

At one of the faculty sessions, the
professor decided to imitate Jules La-
barth’s style of throwing the ball a
few feet instead of rolling it straight
from the hand,

Stiffly he bent. Stiﬁly he straighten-
ed. Out flew the ball. It landed with
a crack three-quarters down the alley
as divers faculty members skudded
for safety.

The following Monday they were re-
pairiiig the alley-—coincidence of

Also at the Monday session was
John Dambach, physical education di.

Liberal Movement Within
Church Making New Headway

While Full Stomaclis Tend To Make One Think Of Morals,
Empty Ones Make One Despair Of “Stony Sermons”

 

 

By Edwin Banks

N ONE OF THE ﬁrst-of these co1uinns~last- semester I offered the-opinion
that organized churches in America were tending toward a new liberal
That opinion has been strengthened by several developments
since then; and the recent resolutions passed by a, conference of Unitarians.
backing a political program that is virtually state socialism, justify to my
mind a. further treatment of the phenomenon.

There are probably several explanations of this tendency; two appear

outstanding. The ﬁrst is simply a
matter of practical policy. During
times of prosperity it is all well and
good for preachers to thunder about
moral laxity, ex-
travagance, and
materialism, The

‘ bellies of the
' people are full,
and they can

suffer twinges of
conscience which
do not affect
t h e i r indiges-
tioiis.

Stony Sermons

Vvhen there is
a serious depres-
sion, however,
such as we still
enjoy in spite of,
or along with,
the New Deal, the minister cannot
appeal forever for men to forget the
kingdoms of earth and aspire towards
the Kingdom of Heaven. Christ, Him-
self, in saying that men do not live
by bread alone, stressed at the same
time the importance of it. Vi/‘hen the
masses ask for bread, they grow tired
of being given stony sermons.

Coiisoquently, one of the reasons the
church is growing distinctly liberal is
that it must grow liberal to retain its
hold on the people. And it seems to
me that far-sighted clergymeii of the
United States, realizing the unpleas-
ant fate of the reactionary churcli in
Russia and in Mexico, are (letcrinined
not to encourage a similar cata.stroplie
in this country,

However, this material considera-
tion is undoubtedly a less important
factor in the religious movement than
an increasing conversion of chui'ch-
men to p1'ogi°essive political princi-
ples. Among the younger ministers
the spirit is probably strongest. Their
minds were not petriﬁed a score of
years ago with the ideals of an age
that is dead. They are closer to the

that rliapsodies on the brotherhood

The Opiate Religion

=Com1nunists and soine~ socialists
have lost any vestige of faith in the
possibility of the church’s swelling
the tide of social progress. They
quote Lenin’s famous indictment:
“Religion is the opium of the people.”
They preach atheism with religious
fervor.

Before church followers anathema-
tize the anti-religionist reformers or
revolutionaries, they should give seri-
ous attention to the reasons for the

are disaproving their claims.

As a matter of fact, skeptical liber-
als should heartily welcome religious
recruits. Progressivism requires ap-
pealing moral and ethical emphasis as
well as a _iii_ateria1istic emphasis.
America needs hundreds of clergymcu
like Pittsburgh's Dr. Clausen who
point out that the l1oped—for social re-
construction will enablc men to have
bread but to live by more than bread
alone, that a new spirit of helping the
liindmost instead of letting the devil
take him will arise-_

The Fighting Man

For the common man will light,
just as he did in the ﬁrst World
Vvar, for a moral principle.
The rugged individiialistj who
inspired him to lose his life that
the world might be safe for democ-
racy, ,lHitler,' Mussolini, and Stalin dis-
proved the very core of their eco-
nomic t.h.eor,v by their successful pro-
paganda. Private inoney-grabbing
iniative is not the sole basis of human
motivation. And if Americans can be
moved to battle for Belgians, French-
men, and Britishers, with guns and
poison gas, they surely can be moved
to battle for themselves with words
and ballots. The cars of our Congress-
men are more sensitive than they
have been for a long time—they are
listening.

So the cliurch can do its part in
achieving a. genuine New Deal for the
United States. Its contributions can
be to stress the moral and ethical do
sirability of the coming order.

Cats Travel To

Penn State

For Jungle Tilt With Lions

 

Emrick Stars Against Hoyas In Cats’ Last Home Game;
14 Points In Four Minutes Is Grand Finale

 

An old basketball rivalry that was broken oﬁ two years ago will
be resumed tomorrow night up‘at’Stat‘e College when Dr. C-arlson’s
brilliant Panther basketball team pitches into Earl Leslie ’s Nittany

Lion cagers in the season’s ﬁrst.

meeting of the two teams. The

Panther party leaves tomorrow morning for State College.
Coach Earl Leslie has had tough sledding with his Lion varsity
this season. The team started like a house aﬁre but hit a. slump

which the State boys are still in.
Three straight games have been drop-
ped recently by State, the last two
by decisive margins. Tech made life
miserable for the Lion team by wal-
loping them a few weeks ago, 54-35,
while Syracuse stepped in and smack-
ed State last week, 47-34

,. Leslie has had a difficult time find-
ing a combination that will click to-
gether and win some games for dear
old State. Of the usual starting var-
sity only two players are back from
last year’s squad, Captain Johnny
Stocker and Fred Kornick. Stocker,
at forward, is the outstanding player
on the ‘Lion team, being a clever
ﬂoorinan and a dead shot. Frank
Smith teams with Stocker at the other
forward post. McVVilliams and Riley
alternate at the center position, with
McVVil1iams usually starting the
games. At the guards are found Kor-
nick, Riley and Glennon, only two
at a time of course.

The Panther cagers came to the
end of the home trail Wednesday
night as they defeated Georgetown,
40-25, before a crowd which was not
quite so great as that which gathers
at only a. medium-sized ﬁre. After
having things pretty much their own
wav at the start of the battle, the Cats
found themselves losing ground to the
H03-as and with only four minutes
to go the score was 26-25, favoring
Pitt. ,

Cribbs ﬁnally shook off Ed Har-
gaden, the Hoya whose sole interest
in the game was to keep Claire from
scoring, and sunk two baskets while
Ferguson was getting three and Ein-
rick two. It was one of the greatest
spurts ever seen in the pavilion and
was a fitting conclusion for a club
that appeared to be able to turn 011
the power’ at will all season. _ _

Cribbs, Skip Hughes, and VVa1n1o
performed their last acts for the local
fans, but while their passing and ball-
hanilling was of the de luxe order,
Fate gave the prize for the shooting
to sophomore Ross Emrick. And when
the old order chaiigeth, yielding place
to a new one which can hang up 18
‘points in a game. there is still some
hope for the future.

Jack gets home again—and they will
land up at the Stadium tomorrow
night when the Pitt varsity boxers
meet the -representatives of the Naval
school in what promises to be one of
the best matches of the season.

.‘Coach Jack Schricker ha.s his Pan-
ther boxers in the pink of condition
for their attempt to stop the Middies
who are regarded as the outstanding
contenders for the Easitern crown-'.
The Panthers displayed good defensive
blocking in the Wisconsin match, but
were weak in in-ﬁghting.

The Navy has won four out of ﬁve
matches this season, defeating VVest-
ern Maryland, Richmond, Penn State
and Syracuse and losing only to Vir-
ginia, last year’s national champs.

One of the feature bouts of the
evening should be in the 135-pound di-
vision in which Captain Jimmy Gian-
natti of Pitt meets Blitch, the Navy
lightweight. Giannatti, who has not
been beaten in ﬁve starts this year,
will be out for his sixth victory.

“THERE'S SO MUCH GOING OPE in college today,"
says James Casey, '3 7, “that an undergraduate can hardly
find time to work everything in. l’m studying a business
course; am mixed up in several outside activities; and,
in my spare time, I’m doing tutoring. So naturally I feel
rather weary and ‘fed up’ at times. To head off fatigue,
I always turn to Camels. Smoking a Camel does ‘wake
up’ my energy. It’s a delightful experience! And what-a
great taste Camels have-—mild, yet full and rich. I never
get tired of Camels. I guess that's why I smoke so many.
But steady smoking doesn’t bother zne—-Caxr"'»s never

get on my nerves!”

Debaters Return
From Penn State
Marriage Forum

 

Audience Agrees With Negative
That Graduates Should Not
Wed On $1,500 Salary

Minimum Set At $2,000

“If all debates," said Marguerite
Swank, C35, “are like this last one,
I shall devote my life to intercollegiate
debating.” Miss Swank was summing
,.up impressions of the debating trip
to Penn State and Juniata colleges
‘from which she and Marcella Leyton,
C37, returned this week.

At both colleges, the audiences de-
cided deﬁnitely, after hearing debates
on the proposal, that a college grad-
uate with a salary of $1500 a year
should not marry before the age of 25.‘
Decisions were on an audience change-
of-opinion ballot. I

At the debate at Penn State college,
Miss Swank and James Townsend of
Penn State upheld the aﬁirmative side
and Miss Leyton and Roy J. VVilkin-
son of Penn State defended the nega-
tive view. Of the audience, 90 mem-
bers shifted their opinions in favor
of the negative, while 78 changed to
the affirmative, and 66 held to their
original opinions.

The New York Times, in comment-
ing on the debate, said: “Miss
Swank, opening the debate, listed the
advantages of early marriage and pre-
}sented a romantic picture of a young
couple establishing a home of their
‘own.

“Miss Leyton closed the argument
by a realistic picture of ,the young
wife doling out 50 cents lunch money
and two street car tickets to the
young husband each morning.

“Each team set up a budget, and
eventually stood or fell on the results.
The aﬁirmative sought to demonstrate
that the young couple could live com-
fortably on $1,500. The negative con-
tended for a minimum nearer $2,000.

“The debate,” the Times concluded,
“marked a departure from the cus-
tom of ‘settling’ national and interna-
tional affairs in undergraduate
forums. The venture into the ﬁeld of
more homely subjects was made a
the instance of Joseph F. O’Brien,
m.en’s debate coach at Penn State.
The cooperation of Miss Theresa
‘Hahn, women’s debate coach at Pitts-
burgh, made the venture a success.”

To Horse--Away
Cry New Riding
Club Aspirants

“To boot, to saddle, to horse, and
away!” A group of men and women
students will be up and away around
the bridle paths near Carnegie as
soon as ﬁnal plans for a riding club
have been completed.

Audrey Graham, C37, is organizing
the club with the help of Miss Eliza-
betlr C. Rearick. assistant professor
of physical education. Freshman
service classes for gym credit are be-
ginning this week, and arrangements
have been made to offer the riding
facilities for students interested.

The club will ride every IVednes-
day for a nominal fee, transportation
being furnished to and from the
stables. 11 students who are inter-'
ested in the formation of the organi-
zation are requested to hand in their
names to Jane Booth or to Miss
Graham, or to leave a note addressed
to her on the bulletin board of the
Pan-ther oﬂice, Room 801, Cathedral.
Any persons who would like to accom-
pany the freshman service classes
may do so by applying to Miss Graham
or to Miss Booth.

Panhel Members
To Fete Pledges

Miss Rush, Council President, To
Speak At Lunch Today

IVon1en who pledged to social fra-
ternities as a result of spring rushing,
will be entertained by the members
of Panhellenic Council at luncheon to-
day in Heinz House at 12:30 o’clock.
Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean of
women, and Muriel Di’.-s, president of
the Council, will address the group.
All new pledges are required to at-
tend the luncheon, at which they will
be introduced to the members and of-
ﬁcers of Panhellenic, and will hear
the Panhellenic song for the ﬁrst time.
Because of the increased number of
fraternity women on campus, it was
thought inadvisable to ask the pledges
to entertain the actives at a novelty
party as usual. Members of the Coun-
cil decided that they would prefer to
welcome the newcomers to the organ-
ization at a luncheon which they will
serve.

Miss Dorothy Brandao of New Or-
leans, national president of Beta
Sigma Omicron, will be a guest at the
affair.

A formal banquet for all active fra-
ternity women and pledges is being
planned for Thursday, March 28.

New Druids Installed
At Outdoor Ceremonies

Tom Howard, C37, and Nathan
Schwartz, C37, were formally tapped
to Druids, sophomore honorary activi-
ties fraternity, Wednesday in the

 

Alumni hall main entrance.

Ernest Rose, C37, Druid president,
took charge of the tapping ceremony.
Initiation will take place next Friday
night at the Kappa Sigma house.

Seniors Prepare
For Muster Day

Wednesday Program Includes
Style Show, Buffet Supper

Senior women will assemble at
Heinz House on VVednesday for their
Senior Muster day at 2:30 o’clock in-
stead of 3:30 o’clock, as had been
originally planned.

This change was made necessary
because of the large selection or
styles that will be shown in the Mus-
ter day fashion show.

There are still a fairly large num-
ber of senior women who have not
been interviewed about the coming
events of the senior class. However,
this has been largely due to inability
to contact girls because of conﬂicting
schedules. Every senior woman is
urged to come to Muster day even if
she has not been interviewed.

According to Frances McLaughlin,
chairman of the academic dress com-
mittee, all possible types of dresses
that might be chosen as the senior
academic dress will be represented at
the style show.

The style show, which begins at
2:30 o’clock will be followed by a
buffet supper which will cost 35 cents.
Muster day will terminate at 8:30
o’clock. :

A part of a mimeographed program
to be distributed for the day will con-
tain a prei'erential ballot, which
senior women will use in making ﬁnal
selection of the two alternate styles
for commencement activities.

All-University Bridge

Sophomores Select Chairman To
Consider Proposition

 

Hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs
will be uppermost in the thoughts of
all University women some Saturday
in the near future if the plans of the
sophomore cabinet are carried out.

At a cabinet meeting Wednesday, it
was suggested that the sophomores
sponsor a bridge to which any Univer-
sity women might come. Although
no deﬁnite arrangements have been
made, a chairman, Alberta Boyer, was
appointed and plans for the affair will
be announced within two weeks.

ll/Iembers of the cabinet will have a
luncheon two weeks from today.

Political Science Head 3

VVomen students are urged to call

monthly Parents’ Council meeting on
Monday evening at 7:45 o’clock in

cal science department attempts to do
for students,” an address to be pre-
sented by Dr. Elmer Graper, head of
the department of political science.

As no special invitations are being
issued, the notices which appear in
the Pitt News will constitute the only
announcement of the meeting. A so-
cial hour will follow the formal gath-
ering, which is open to parents of all
women students on campus.
