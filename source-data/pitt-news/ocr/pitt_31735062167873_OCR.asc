Student Government Elections Invalid

We. the Student Government Elections
Committee. hereby declare the January 23.
1970. election void and call for a new elec-
tion on February 4. 1970. The decision of
the Committee was dictated by difficulties
in voting procedure which prevented a
number of students from voting. The re-
quirement for validated ID cards. and the
fact that a number of students had not yet
been invoiced was a primary barrier to vot-
ing. Although authorization from the Of-
fice of the Registrar was sufficient for a
student to vote without a validated invoice
or ID card. this procedure was poorly pub-
licized. Therefore. on the basis of the close-
ness of the results of the election and the
number of students potentially and actual-
ly denied the right to vote. the Committee
feels forced to call a new election.

Rules governing the upcoming election
V are:
1. The election will be held on Wednesday.

room. from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.

-GOal Of SCU Party Student Iiwlovement Requirement

by HARRIS MILLER

Because of the situation engendered by the ruling of the Student
Government (SGJ Election Committee. this brief statement in the Pitt
News becomes the only device by which I can retransmit the platform
of the Student Community Union (SCU l.

The SCU continues to stand on one major issue—restructuring SG.
The means for this restructuring are "open hearings“ to be held
throughout the campus headed by a restructuring commission that will
draw up a new constitution for SG by March 10. 1970. from the ideas and
opinions taken from the hearings. If no document is forthcoming from
the commission by March 10. then the proposed Constitution as drawn
up by the SCU will become the document submitted to the students for
a referendum. In essence. then. it is the choice of the students as to how
much of a say they would like to have in the restructuring of SG. The
hearings will be open and will be plentiful so that all students can be-
come the main thrust of new ideas for the Constitution if they so choose.

As for other aspects of SG. the SCU is greatly concerned with stu-
dent welfare and those aspects of student life that are served by SG.
This concern does not mean a list of cure—all promises. Rather it means
that the SCU will open up SG committees to all interested students so
that the committees can function well.

It’s the aim of myself and the other members of the SCU not to
count on only a few select students within the structure for new ideas,
but rather to have an open system so that any student with ideas and
initiative can bring ideas to light.

Briefly outlining the substantial projects that have already begun
during the half-wekk I was president-elect. first we have the restructur-
ing commission being organized and holding several meetings. and. by
the time you have read this article. it will have held its first open hear-
ing. Second. committee positions in SG are being filled through recruit-
ment. Applications have been printed and advertising has been done in
The Pitt News. After only one such advertisement in the Pitt News,
nearly 30 students stopped in the SG office in a single day to pick up
committee applications. Third..one special committee has been tenta-
tively organized by two girls who. after reading my statements in the
Pitt News concerning an open SG. came to the SG office to discuss set-
ting up the committee. 0

garding the new SG election is one
of bitter humor——bitter because

by STEVE CUNDRA

This past week. the Elections Committee unanimously voted to
void the first Student Government <SGJ election and called for a new‘
one this Wednesday. The Elections Committee was forced to, reach this
obvious conclusion because it recognized the illegitimacy of the first
election. There were many irregularities and possible vote fraud re-
ported to have occurred. Also. approximately 2.000 undergraduate stu-
dents were disenfranchized from voting because the administration
failed to process their invoices properly and deliver them in time. And
how could anyone call an election legitimate when only 17 per cent of
the undergraduate body voted. especially considering many were pre-
vented from doing so.

Election statistics also showed that about 1.650 undergraduates
voted out of a possible 10.000. Less than one-fifth of the people deter-
mined who wouldaffect plicy forthe entire school. And the irony is this
first election was not just a meaningless SG election. because this elec-
tion will "determine which students will represent us on the University
Faculty Senate and its committees. But now there is a second chance
to increase that turn-out so more -than 17 per cent of the students can
determine who will lead all of us. Take this unprecedented opportunity
——or submit to the governance of a selected few who will now have the
power, on the University Senate, to plan your actions and expect you
to follow them. '

My opponent represents a leadership of the past, and those in the
past elected him—Sy Adler. his campaign manager, was also Scott
Baum's the year before. as explained in a recent Pitt News article. I
offer you a much-needed change. with new people who were not part of
past mistakes. So what you are faced‘ with is a choice—continue the past
leadership and the; petty politics of this campus. or realize the poten-
tials of SG by electing people who are dedicated to try to solve the same
campus problems which past SG‘s have ignored.

And they have ignored much. Last year, SG Allocations Committee
received $127,000 in Student Activity Fees. This past term, the Activity
Fee was raised from $6 to $8 a term without student approval (which
is necessary in such cases). Despite this rather large budget, we had to
stomach a third-rate Homecoming and mediocre or nonexistant enter-
tainment throughout the year. Men's Dorm Council had its budget cut
from $7,000 to $3,600 when students living in the men’s dorms pay
$16,000 a year. Greeks had to wait another year for the.‘promised Fra-
ternity Row. Commutters had to suffer another year of poor parking
and "wait for their Coimnuter’s Association be be revitalized, when they
contribute $56,000 in Activity Fees..And we all had to pay the high
prices at our Book Store when a

Abolished  

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

In ‘an all-day marathon of heat- ,

ed debate and compromise Sat-
urday in Clapp Hall, the’Faculty
of Arts and Sciences (FAS) made

a final ruling on the status of the

foreign language requirement and
passed on a series of curricular
and procedural issues.

Presided over by FAS Dean Dr.
Jerome Rosenberg, the faculty

body of 175 including student j A

voters:

— Abolished the foreign lan-
guage requirement as of Septem- ; -
ber, 1970. by a1 secret vote of 91-‘

69 with 18 absentee ballots com-

ing in. The ruling does not apply 0

to seniors presently in sight of re-
quirement completion. .

‘ '—Formally instituted the “I”
grade as a CAS option. The re-

search grade, “I” is awarded with g

the consent of the instructor to
students who need more time than
the term allows to complete work
in a subject area. While “I”
grades do not affect QPA, no cred-
it is assigned until the ma-rk is sub-
stituted with a quality grade.

— Decided that a “G” grade
shall no longer be counted as “FT’

in QPA computation. Under the .

present system, “G” grades must

be removed within one, term after

they are assigned.

The decision abolishing the lan-
guage requirement was the fruit
of two and one-half hours of stren-
uous discussion against a back-

ground of some 18 years of contro- 6

versy over the issue at the Uni-
versity. .

if Language Abolished

(Continued from Page 1)

From the Other Side

Opposition to the abolition came
from several quarters. One posi-
tion was summed up by the pro-
posal of Dr. Harry C. Avery”
chairman of the Department of
Classics, who objected to the sin-
gl,i“ng.out of the foreign language
requirement while other Univer-
sity requirements are standing.
 Dr. » Avery’s proposal advocated
the abolition of English and distri-
bution requirements, along with
language. -
°_ Although his suggestion was de-
feated by a voice vote from the
‘floor, it symbolized opposition to
-what he labelled “a piece meal ap-
-.proach.’’ -
‘-Other objectors rasied the ques-
étions of the. effects on lower
schools and the financial situa-
‘tions of the language departments.
‘predicting that a drop-off in stu-
dent registration for language
courses would damage them.

.In an attempt to satisfy both
sides. of the question, the FAS al-
tered the ‘basic proposal of the
Faculty of the Arts and Sciences
Council (FASC) by adding an
amendment urging “the adminis-
tration to continue to supply in the
language department budgets fel-
lowships sufficient to attract high-
»ly' qualified graduate students in
-numbers sufficient to ensure the
continuation of graduate study on
a scale appropriate to a major
University.”

A. ._ Itfurther urged that the bud-
»,gets.be bolstered enought to "at-
{tract and hold a faculty of high
dprofessional quality."

; _~,Courses Can Be Distributed

In addition. the resolution plac-
,~e'dj on a par all language courses
‘as eligible for distribution fulfill-
.ment. In the past. levels one
-through four did not satisfy the
distribution of studies require-
them.
;°vj -Departmental qualificatons.
:{however,’are not affected by the
7 move to abolition. Majors in such
apre‘as.asVFine Arts and Chemistry
I ,will "still be required to complete
L,-languages according to depart-
;?ment stipulations.

A suggestion to look into the de-
velopment of a language acquisi-
ﬁtion center was forwarded by Ed-
mwyard M. Anthony, chairman, of

perience (OOCLE) was referred
back to its sponsor CAS Dean Jer-
ome Schneewind "to prepare a
new version of the OOCLE pro-
posal to submit to the FAS at its
next meeting."

In its original form. the resol-
ution dealt with three categories
of our-of-the-classroom learning;
independent study programs. co-
curricular and extra-curricular
activities and community involve-
ment. I

While the two first options are
already in operation in the Uni-
versity, the third area. commun-
ity involvement attracted the
most opposition. Drawn up by
both the FASC and CASC. the doc-
ument requested that "students
who have obtained faculty spon-
sorship be allowed to register
and receive credit for community
service work under either a de-
partmental or CAS independent
study option.

Opponents of the bill question-
ed its necessity and as one put it
"the fact that students might be
deprived of the excitement by as-
signing credits to their volunteer
activities.

No Pre-Experience

Completely stricken frm the
proposal was a clause that would
accredit "activities previously
completed if the student has se-
cured sponsorship of a University
faculty member and can-demon-
strate inthe form of a research
paper or a series of discussions
the educational value of the ex-
perience."

According to Dr. Rosenberg. op-
position to this portion of the pro-
position was rejected by the fac-
ulty "because they were feeling
that the principle of retroactivity
would be removed." and would
open a whole "Pandora's box of
problems.“ .

"The faculty are cautious; they
move slowly into new areas." in
the FAS Dean interpreted. They
want to "insure that out-of-the-
classroom learning can be true
learning.“ I

Winter Weekend Movie Changed

 

Curious (Yellow) Cancelled

by EVAN PATTAK
Staff Writer

1 Am Curious (Yellow), the con-
troversial film that was to have
been shown during Winter Week-
end, has been cancelled by the
Winter Weekend Committee. The
Committee. according to its busi-
ness manager. Lee Reichbaum.
was forced into the decision to
drop the film by a number of im-
portant considerations.

"At first." related Reichbaum.
"we were worried that the reac-
tion in Harrisburg would be."

In Harrisburg, the Pennsyl-
vania State Legislature has failed
to appropriate any funds for State-
related schools. including the Uni-
versity. Reichbaum and his com-

mitteemen, remembering the,

Fleming Bill of last year. wonder-
ed if showing the film would pro-
voke the Legislature to enact puni-
tive measures.

“We were worried that the State
would be angry enough to hold
back funds,” explained Reich-
baum, “and we were also afraid
of the complications that could
have arisen with alumni.”

The Committee might still have
shown the movie if a representa-

tive of Allegheny County District
Attorney Robert Duggan had not
threatened to raid the showing.

"I spoke to Gerald Paris. Assis-
tant District Attorney." reported
Reichbaum. "and he explained his
reason for calling the film porno-
graphic. He never explicitly said
that he would raid us. but he made
it perfectly clear that he would."

With the knowledge that they
would not be able to show the film
uninterrupted, Reichbaum, Coin-
mittee Chairman Cindy Niklas,
and several other Committee
members met last Tuesday after-
noon with Dean of Students R.
Ronald Pease and Associate Dean

T of Students Konnilyn Feig to dis-

cuss the situation.

"We discussed all of the major
issues and some minor ones."
noted Reichbaum. “including the

fact that this movie would cost‘

$500. while wecould be a top-notch
film. such as The Graduate, for
only $150.

A curious manner in which Cur-
ious was originally chosen also
came to light at the meeting.

~Reichbaum maintained that "it

really was the work of only one

person. but after it was chosen no
one on the Committee said no.“

The Committee, rankled by
what Chairman Niklas angrily
termed “moral censorship,” was
not anxious to yield to it. “After
all,” offered Dean Feig, “we
weren’t talking about some stag
film from the Elk’s Club. This is a
movie that has been shown
throughout the nation.”

After some deliberation. the
caucus elected to heed the more
practical considerations. “It
seemed kind of silly." stated Dean
Feig. “to show the movie. when
someone would have been waiting
to pull the plug of the projector
out. It was still a tough decision.
and nobody is satisfied with it. "

Reichbaum. agreeing that he
was more ‘than a little upset by
having to take part in the cancel-
ing of the film. asserted, however.
that “the decision reached was
ours. the students. The adminis-
tration did not exert any pressure
on us.

Shortly after the cancellation,
the Committee announced the
showing of Elvira Madigan and
The Collector in place of Curious.

sources and funds of SG been
spent on student needs?

SG should work on these and

other student needs as well as re-
structuring and University policy-
making. It should be an innova-
tive and dynamic force in the Uni-
versity. "not the object of ridicule
and abuse. But until SG begins to
realize its own potential. the ridi-
cule and abuse will continue to be
justified.
. Let’s just look at last week’s
SG election. This campaign was
predominated by the usual “gar-
bage” which seems to attach it-
self to student politics here at
Pitt. With all the petty politics and
political manuevering that went
on, -I’m surprised anyone knew
what the real issues were.

In my mind. the real issues
were Pitt. student involvement.
and student welfare. SG needs to
bring students together to solve
their own problems. Though both
my opponent and I agree that SG
nees to be restructured. we differ
on the effect of putting students
on University Faculty commit-
tees. Scott Baum has said we
should “put all our eggs intmthe
Faculty Senate basket.“

I reject this idea. We must work
through the Faculty Senate to ef-
fect change, but we should not al-
low the faculty to plan our Home-
coming or the administration to

determine our Activity Fee lpI‘0- ,

viding an effective cover for tui-
tion increase). In areas of student
concern and student welfare. we
must be 100 per cent independent.
If SG is ever to hold a respectable
place in the University commun-
ity. we need to make it work for
the students and not just sit on it
and use it as a personal play-
thing. ‘ -

Right now, the major issues on
campus is not how best to restruc-
ture SG, but rather getting stu-
dents who are interested in work-

Urges Involvement

ing for this school on the commit-
tees of the Faculty Senate where
they can effect change, and_do-
ing all we can as a united student
body to lobby in Harrisburg for
our State appropriations and our
State scholarship grants.

If we continue to fight among
ourselves. for shallow poer and
titles. if we continue to divorce
ourselves from student needs and
opinions. we will all be losers in
the end. SG will not only lose the
respect of the students lit’ past
SG's haven‘t done sojalreadyl.
but we may well lose the larger
esteem of our University.

I lost the last election by 18
votes. If you failed to vote in the
last election. you should reconsi-
der the necessity to do so. This
election will elect students with
power for they will decide who
will represent us on the Universi-
ty Faculty Senate. which makes
policy for everyone. The revote
will take place this Wednesday in
the SU Ballroom from 9:30 a.m.
to 6 p.m. All that is needed to vote
will be a blue plastic ID card. If a
student was not enrolled full-time
last term. he will also need his
pink registration slip. This elec-
tion may make or break SG. The
choice is YOURS.

SGEC CENSURES USC Party

According to the election
code, any party whose expendi-
tures exceed $200 is subject to
the disciplinary action of the
SG Elections Committee. But
the action taken against the
USC Party is a farce. Is cen-
sureship in The Pitt News am-
ple disciplinary action?

“Disqualification is the su-
preme penalty the Elections
Committee can levy,” said
Vice-Chairman Harold Marks,
explaining the censureship of
the United Student Coalition

"Party, “but that's only done if

forces this.

somebody punches Posvar or
something like that.”

BREAKING the election code
as outlined by SGEC is “some-
thing like that.” Whatis to stop
the USC Party, or for that mat-
ter the SCU Party, from break-
ing the rules of maximum ex-
penditures for the new elec-
tion this Wednesday‘? And what

is to stop any party during,

election campaigns in years to
follow? Surely, censureship in
The Pitt News is not the an-
swer.

of $36,000. International profits and markets are

GE IS ONE of  . . the giant corporations that

of the 50 largest industrial concerns shows the fol-

These 37 companies account for over 90 per cent

Members of Women’s Liberation
claim that last Saturday evenings
Miss University of Pittsburgh
Pageant helped perpetuate an un-
fair societal emphasis upon beau-
ty which randomly rewards those
fortunate enough to be defined as
beautiful by the very same socie-
tal emphasis that pageant purport-
edly perpetuated.

Well, our society loo_ks at men
in a much different light than the
"feminine“ role of beauty identi-
fied in’ the pageant ritual. The
"masculine" role, which includes

- bringing home the bread, also in-

cludes tasks associated with war.
Just as every girl strives to be
Raquel Welch. every boy is taught
to idolize John Wayne. And such
wacky“‘beliefts are perpetuated
by such practices as the-recent
"Mr. Draft Pageant."

To refresh the reader's mem-
ory. we recall the gala program.
Opening to the strains of a Sousa
March played by the Marine Corps

. Band, the master of ceremonies

and runner-up of last year’s con-
test, Private Park Burts, welcom-
ed us to this year’s contest. After
introducing the distinguished
"Board“ of judges. Park stepped
aside and 366 young men. each
representing all the young men in

There seems to be but two
choices: eliminate the rule
concerning expenditures lim-
itations or enforce it appropri-
ately. The latter seems more
feasible for a fair and orderly
SG election.

After all, why make rules if
there is no intention to enforce
them? That was obviously the
case when SGEC censured the
USC Party. The SG Elections
Committee proved that USC
spent a good $40 above the $200
limit and suspected (but could
not prove without an extensive

- investigation) that USC was in-

 

volved with the Committee for

Effective Student Government.

Would more appropriate ac-
tion have been taken. if the
Jan. 23 election was not de-
clared void, or if there were
more than two candidates run-
ning in the new election?_

ACCORDING to Marks, the
rather token SGEC action is
simply a matter of the limita-
tions set on that committee by
the SG Senateirules. If such is
the case, hopefully the next
SG president, or the new Com-
mission, whatever, will see to
it that the election code is re-

CUT THIS LETTER OUT AND MAIL IT
IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR STATE LEGISLATOR!

Dear Legislator,

I am writing to you to express my concern -for the
University of Pittsburgh’s financial appropriation

from the State.

It has been brought to my attention that delay.
in appropriating monies to the University has caused
them to borrow money from banks, resulting in daily
interest payments as high as $5,000.00.

. I also understand that when the money is appro- .
priated, no compensation will be made for these in-
terest payments.

_ Therefore, every day you delay your appropria-
tion, it is costing the University money. This affects
me in higher tuition rates and the University’s inabil-
ity to hire badly neededfaculty members.

Thus, I urge you to do everything in your power
to appropriate the monies as quickly as possible.

Thank you

Liberation Too.

day). Then Park Burts reappear-
ed to announce that "because we
hope to deescalate this part of the
pageant and remove it from the

competition, we held the physicals

backstage and in private.” There
followed the dress uniform com-
petition, while the band softly
played “Call Me Irresistible" in
the background.

When Park Burts reappeared
on stage. he had this to say. “As
you know. talent counts as 50 per
cent of our judging. We will ‘nom-
inate‘ the most talented irregard—
lss of how they did on their physi-
cal.” With this, Park stepped to
the side and the band played "No
Matter What Shape Your Stomach
Is In" while props were moved to
the proper place.

It would take too long to recount

all of the presentations. A few of .

the more memorable were "Tanks

for the Memories." sung by num- ,

her 186; "Call Me Malay Yellow.“
sung by number 245 and ,“The
Fool on the Hill“ bynumber 73. A
thrilling imitation of a double am-
putee was done by number two as
he read a passage from Farewell
to Arms. Finally. all the numbers
from 201 to 231 got together to put
on Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.

AS THE applause died down,
Park Burts reminded everyone
that the physical aspect was being
deemphasized. “Figures do not
matter. It doesn‘t make any dif-
ference if you have number one or
number 366. Everybody will go.
And now for the question periods. .
We've invited a psychiatrist to in-
terrogate everybody to makesure

 

we don’t have any complexes, es-
pecially military—industrial ones.”

There followed that well-re-
membered scene where all the
boys answered, “I can only give
you my name, rank and lottery
number.”

Upon completing the question
period, Park Burts again appeared
at the microphone. "And now to
give the judges one more chance
to look at the contestants. Would
everybody please line up? Now
take a quarter-turn to the left.”

THE WAVERING line of con-
fused men turned every which
way. Losing his patience, Park
barked. “Attention! Left face.”
Instinctively, the cowering column
swung left. "Bout fact . . . right
face." The men lost thier instinc-
tiveness and bumped into each
other once again.

Unpreturbed, Park looked at
the judges. "Is the final ballot
ready?” Getting no response,
Park turned to the microphone.
"Today’s winners go on to Her-
shey for the selection of Officer
Traning Candidates. And I see the
judges are ready.” Nervously rip-
ping the envelope open. Park look-
ed gleefully at the results. “And
. . . (stacatto drum beat fills the
interval) everybody won.”

All America remembers what
happened after that. The scenes
in the locker room as President
Nixon crowned each winner with
a drab olive helmet, the winners
tears as they say goodbye to their
parents and friends. Park Burts
singing, “There they go. ..” May-
be women aren’t_ the only ones who
need to be liberated. . .

The Student Government (SGl Restruc-
turing Commission feels that the constitu-
tion of SG must be questioned and reform-
ed. While the Commission was mandated
by Harris Miller and had secured commit-
ments from him and the Senators of the Stu-
dent Community Union before the election.
it will continue to hold open hearings and
work towards a viable form of SG. regard-
less of which candidate wins in the new elec-
tions on Wednesday.

This past week the Commission met with
the student presidents of Men‘s Dorm Coun-
cil. Woman's Housing Board. Commuter
Association, the editor of The Pitt News,
and the chairman of the Arts and Sciences

.aCabinet to ascertain these students opinions

on their relationship between their groups
and SG.

Meetings were also held with the vice
chancellor for Program Planning and Pub-
lic Affairs, the vice chancellor for Student
Affairs and the director of the Student Un-
ion to hear the opinions on the role of SG in.
each of these areas.

Out of these meetings and discussions and
recent campus developments, the following
areas emerged as important areas of con-
cern. The Commission would like to pre-
sent alternatives and suggest proposals.

1. University Senate:

In view of the University Senate meeting
of Jan. 29, undergraduates now have four
seats on the University Senate Council and
two seats on all University Senate Commit-
tees for a total of 28 undergraduates. The
committees are: Academic Freedom and
Tenure, Educational Policies, Athletic Fac-
ulty Health and Welfare, Budget Policy,
Plant Utilization and Planning, Organiza-

”" tions and Procedures, Computer Usage, Stu-

dent Affairs, Library, Admissions, and Uni-
versity Publications.

The mechanism for placement of students
is as follows:

1. Direct elections to all seats;

2. Election to Senate Council; this body to
either appoint committee members, or

3. Nominate students to committee for
elections.

Classified

II. Composition and Function
of Student Affairs Councils

1. Establishment of two distinct bodies:

a. Academic Council to consist of elected
representatives from every school in the
University, and

b. Social Council to consist of elected rep-
resentatives from interest and activity _or.-
ganizations throughout the University.

These bodies to deal with the respective
areas of concern.

2. A body that will constitutionally repre-
sent student opinion to administrators and
faculty such as the now existing Student Af-
fairs Advisory Committee and this body with
students elected at large.

3. Should any student council exercise
legislative authority for the student body.

III. Duties and Powers of SG Officers:
1. Should there be a president, vice-presi-
dent?

2. Elected vice-presidents in respected

areas.

3. Should officers have appointment pow-
er to SG and/or faculty committees?

4. Or president and vice-president as fa-

_ cilitators and coordinators; and/or

5. Officers as ombudsmen.

IV. Eligibility
1. Should part-time students be allowed
to vote in SG elections and/ or hold office;
2. Should it have original jurisdiction, or
SG offices?

V. Continuity of SG and Faculty Committees
VI. Judicial

1. Should a system be established with
students and faculty only and should its jur-
isdiction extend to

a. Academic,

b. Social discipline,

c. SG areas;

2. Should it have original jurisdi tion. or

3. Serve as an appeal board.
VII. Amending Procedures
and Referendums

Those structures in the -present Student
Government that the Commissioner feels
need reviewing are:

1. Allocations Committee,

a. Should the committee be expanded and/
or directly elected.

b. Should it be accountable to an elected
body or not at all.

c. Should it be allowed to grant emergen-
cy requests without approval‘? ’

d. Do its members have to be approved by
an elected body?

2. Recognitions Committee:

a. Should such a committee exist? and/or

b. Should it maintain its present review
and judicial functions‘? or

c. Serve only as an information agency
for campus organizations?

3. General Assembly. Is such a body
meaningful? ,

a. Should it serve as a communication of
ideas among students or among groups‘?

Monday, February 2, l970—THE PITT NEWS-—Page-5

c. Should it be open to all _or only repre-
sentatives? .

d. Should it meet more than once a term?

4. Existing SG Committees and new ones.

In addition the Commission feels that a
SG Research Committee and a Student Gov-
ernment Public Affairs Committee be con-
stituted.

The Research Committee to assess stu-
dent perceptions on the nature and function
of SC yearlv.

Commission Outlines SG Ills

The Public Affairs Committee to coordi-
nate with the Office for Program Planning
and Public Relations in the administration
dealing with areas such as Harrisburg and
trustee and alumni relations.

The Commission would have discussion

on these and any other areas pertaining to
Student Government.

Open hearings will be held Monday from
noon to 2 a.m. and Thursday from 2 p.m. to
4 p.m. in the Student Union Supper Room.

 

Applications are now available in the Student Government Of-

fice. 305 SU. for positions on University Senate and Student Gov- ‘
ernment Committees. These forms must be completed and returned ’ F

 Smitty Brown Runs His Fastest
"600” In lnVitational’s Highlight

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Two weeks ago, Smitty Brown got boxed in on the final turn
and finished a disappointing third in the 600 yard run, his special-
ty. He wasn’t going to let that happen this week. ’ A

And it didn’t. In Saturday’s Pitt Track Classic, Brown not
only won the 600, but he did it in championship style. His time
of 1:10.1 set a new varsity and Field House records, but perhaps

New "coo" Record

more importantly, Smitty’s time
was only seven-tenths second off
the NCAA mark of 1209.4.

The time of 1:10.1 clipped a
full second off Smitty’s previous
mark of 1:11.1, but he had offi-
cially broken that mark in the
morning trials when he ran
1210.7. Following that perform-
ance, an elated Brown comment-
ed that it “would be hard to dup-
licate that time in the finals, but
he was sure going to try.”

Incidentally, Olympian Lee
vEv_a-ns overtook Villanova’s Larry
James in a meet in Boston Satur-
day to win the 600 with a time of
l:10.8.

,As a result of his outstanding
performance, Brown was named
the oustanding athlete in the class-
ic’s running events. His teammate
Bryant Salter grabbed similar

honors in the field event competi-

tion, as he set a new Field House
record in the high jump with a leap

of 6’9”. ,
Salter also cleared 6’11” three

' times, but on each trial he tipped

the bar on the way down to erase
the effort. Coach Jim Banner
noted that Salter was clearly over
the heighth and it was just a mat-
ter of time till he cleared the sev-
en foot barrier.

For the second straight year.
the thinclads completely domin-
ated the classic, winning eight of
15 events, and losing a ninth on a
disqualification. The disqualifica-
tion came in the mile relay, where
the thinclads had streaked to a
first place finish, but a foul-up on
the baton exchange disqualified
the winning time.

Jerry Richey battled the flu and

Sophomore Dorel Watley, who
has beaten Smitty Brown in the

won top honors with a 49.1. And
John Aiken grabbed first place in

9 Cagers Host C-MU Tartans After

 

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Buzz Ridl brings his Panther

basketball squad home for a"

game against Carnegie-Mellon
tomorrow night after one game
on the road against St. Johns prov-
ed that his cagers’ really are an
improved squad.

The Jungle Cats lost the game to,
 the Redmen in Jamaica, N. Y.,

67-58, ending their four—game win-
ning streak, but they were con-
fronted with a major obstacle, the
personal foul.

The Cats had 22 personals call-

ed against them in the game. com-
pared to the 11 that went against

the Redmen. More important.
however, was the total shots at-
tempted from the free-throw line.

St. Johns took 31 flings from the

'  .thers? nine, attempts; And-at 0.I.le

 

time in the second half the Red-
men had almost unbelievably at-
tempted 14 free throws while
the Cats tried one.

"I thought it was the best game
we’ve played on the road all
year,” Ridl said. "We played well
enough to win.

“St. Johns was strong on they
. boards. That’s the reason they

won. And the number of fouls
made a difference, definitely —
that was a big difference. Over-
all they should have shot more
than us, but not that many. We
didn’t seem to get the same
breaksf‘

St. John’s rebounding was im-
pressive. In the Panthers’ last win
over Westminster the two big men,
Paul O’Gorek and Mike Patcher
combined" for 31 grabs off the
boards. Saturday, the whole squad
came up with only 18.

Center Bill Paultz was the big
difference on the boards for the
Redmen. He snatched 15 re-
bounds. He got some help. too, as
forward Ralph Abraham contri-
buted 11 rebounds.

The rebounds hurt more than
usual because many of them were
offensive ones. That’s why Abra-
ham and Paultz were able to put
20 points and 14 points on the
scoreboard. respectively.

The Redmen’s big gun, Joe De-
pre, came on after a slow start to
score 15 points. »

Kent Scott was the high scorer
for the Panthers again. swishing
for 15. Cleve Edwards also reach-
ed the double figures. connecting
for 11. ' if .

Edwards put the Panthers even
shortly after the second half be-
gan, after the Redmen took a 25-
23 lead into halftime. His equal-
izer paved the way for the Panth-
ers‘ first lead, as Patcher put two
points in after stealing -the ball
from the Redmen.

The Panthers shared baskets

with St. Johns until the Redmen ~

caught up at 29-29 with 17:55 re-
maining. Then, with the half of the»
foul shots and some costly turn-
overs by the Cats, St. Johns slow-
ly increased the margin.

The largest lead was 11 points
with 11:15 left and the Redmen
ahead 49-38.

Lou Carneseccas New Yorkers
are now 11-5 and still hope to
reach one of the two post-season
tournaments.

The Panthers’ mark dropped to
6-8, but the cagers will attempt to
start another winning streak
against a weak Carnegie-Mellon
quintet in tomorrow night’s 8:15
p.m. game at the Field House.

The Tartans have a 1-8 record
this winter. but Ridl doesn't think
his cagers have the game won al-
ready, even if they will be on their
home court and have been shoot-
ing near the 50 per cent clip lately.

“We have a" couple reports on
them." he said. “And they seem
to be similar to Westminster. We
expect the same type of game. We
could have lots of trouble.

Westminster has defeated the

Titans just edged the Tartans, 65-

Coach Carl DePasqua will have
Sto-Rox’s Big 33 candidate, quar-
terback Bob Medvid, in a Panther
uniform next fall. Saturday the
6-3, 185 pounder made the deci-
sion to come to Pitt.

Medvid, Pitt’s second recruit.
narrowed his list of 80 offers
down to six which included‘Mich-
gan State. West Virginia. Michi-
gan, Purdue, Penn State, and Pitt.
Bob finally -picked the Panthers
when he found out that Haverford
quarterback Steve Joachim de-
cided to go to Penn State. Bob.
eager to play against Joachim, fig-.
ured that Pitt would be the best
place to go to accomplish his aim.

The recent announcement that
the language requirement will be
abolished will help DePasqua’s re-
cruiting considerably. Pitt's first
recruit was Kiski‘s Clair Wilson.

week in a row, the mermen suc-

commented that, "we knew their ,

strenght and we swam around
them. Everything went according
to plan.”
