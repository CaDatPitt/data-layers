ANALYZE sircumn ACT

Discussion Of Social Legislation
Features Engineers’ Meeting

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics, reviewed social security
legislation before the Industrial En-
gineers Seminar yestcrday. He referred
particularly to the Social Security Act,
which he described as “a possible, if
limited and moderate program of ex-
perimentation.”

“The Social Security Act may” he
said, “by some amendments, and with
strong administration at Washington
and in the states, be made a force for
progress in reducing the vast relief
burden.”

He was critical of extremists who
opposed the measure and called the
Townsend Plan “moonshine, both silly
and dangerous.

“The Townsend advocates, however,
sincere, like the propogandists for the
Lundeen—Frazier omnibus security bill,
delude themselves as to the payments
that are realistically possible in our
society. Careful estimates, for instance,
as to the yield of the turnover tax pro-
posed by the McGroarty Bill indicate
that hardly more than $30 a month,
rather than the claimed $200 a month,
for each eligible person over 60, might
be provided by it. Such a tax, a py-
ramided sales-levy, would bear ruin-
ously on the masses. The attempt to
operate it would impair recovery and
demoralize business. Such unsound
movements must be outﬂanked by con-
structive developments under the Se-
curity Act.”

He was also skeptical of the prospect
of building a vast reserve in the treas-
ury, estimated at 50 billions of dollars
by 1980, and considered such a reserve
unnecessary.

He believed that study and amend-
ment in the ﬁve year period before pay-
ments begin would bring needed adjust-
ment in the status of industrial retire-
ment allowance plans.

“Unemployment compensation, mul-
tiple record keeping, non-uniform tax
coverage also constitute problems of
a pressing nature,” declared Dr. Tyson.

EA Dance Profits To Make

For Better Smoker———Rumor

Although the Engineering Associa-
tion refuses to make claims unless
they are founded on facts, rumor has
it that the digniﬁed EA Spring Dance
did make money.

In fact, somebody has also rumored
that the coming smoker is to be one
of the best in years, because of what
was cleared at the EA Dance.

, The smoker planned for April 7
under the chairmanship of Robert
Kerr, EE36, is the much-anticipated
stunt smoker. At this event all en-
gineering departments vie for the
honor of adding a silver cup to the
decorations of their offices. This cup
becomes the permanent possession of
the group winning ﬁrst’ prize at three
stunt smokers. a

At present the cup is on top of the
bookcase in the office of the depart-
ment of chemical engineering. ,

Pre-Ed Students

All pre-education sophomores and
transfer students, who intend to enter

the School of Education in June, must ,

ﬁle their applications for admission be-
fore Monday, March 30, in Room 210,
State Hall, the ofﬁce of the School of
Education.

CA Petitions Available
Today In College Office

Petitions will be available today
for nomination to the College As-
sociation from Miss Mackey of the
College oﬁ’ice. All petitions should
be signed and returned to the ofﬁce
by April 1.

Election of members to the asso-
ciation will be held in conjunction
With the SFA and Men’s Council
elections on April 17.

Plans are being, completed for the
spring informal dance of the Asso-
ciation to be held at the Grotto
April 3. Assessment will be $1 per

couple.

FORMER STAR ATHLETE
DIES OF BRAIN TUMOR

Pete Avizienis, Football, Track
Performer, Dies Wednesday

Pete Avizienis, former member of the
varsity football and track teams, died
at 4 o’clock early Wednesday morning
in the St. Francis Hospital, following
an operation last Saturday for a brain
tumor.

The former Mt. Carmel star athlete
had been conﬁned to the hospital for
a three-weeks period preceding his
(leath_W'ednesday. As late as Tuesday
of this week, hope was held for his
recovery by the medical staff when he
rallied early in the evening.

Avizienis was ﬁrst affected by the
tumor growth near his brain early in
December. Doctors, however, did not
operate until last week when the Pitt
junior’s condition became serious. Vir-
tually the entire staff of doctors agreed
that the condition had developed over
a period ranging from several to 10
years.

Starring in the weight events on the

track team, Pete earned a varsity letter
in his sophomore year after competing
on the yearling aggregation. Coach
Olson loses one of his ﬁnest prospects
for the coming track season.
_ On the gridiron, Avizienis, No. 26
jersey spent most of the game time on
the bench, but saw plenty of action
every night on the practice ﬁeld. He
was one of the largest boys on the
squad, tipping the scales at better than
_200 pounds and stretching six feet, one
lllCl’l high.

Interment is planned for the Mount
Carmel cemetery.

Give Medical Aid In Stricken Area

By’Haro1d Hoffman
Students And faculty members from many University departments, from
Trees Gymnasium to the Cathedral, cooperated with the American Red Cross
and other relief organizations during the recent inundation of the I-’ittsburgh

district.

Mainly volunteers, the students worked as life-guards in the flooded areas,

as special deputies, Red Cross attaches,

repairmen, and many simply as general

relief workers. According to reports many of them went several days without

sleep or rest.

Included in the Pennsylvania National Guard which policed the downtown

areas and prevented loo_ting in
damaged stores were A. L. Caney, J.
L. Sobkoviak, Edwin St. Peter, and
Cecil Vaccare, all University students.
In answer to a plea for experienced
swimmers for rescue work, 16 students
who were members of the swimming
team or had life-guard experience were
sworn in as life-guards and special
deputies. Among those who were mus-
tered into the service were: Thomas
Locke, W'alter Nowotny, Edward Mc-
Quillan, John Stiranka, Russell Lind-
berg, Edward Spotovich, George Musu-
lin, Harold Tost, Cleon Linderman,
Andrew Lasky, Murray Nelligan, Ed-
ward Lincoln, and Robert Geretty.

University Nurses Assist

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director of
Student Health Service for women,
along with Miss Pauline Thatcher,
health service nurse, worked under the
Red Cross at the Hamilton School in
McKees Rocks, from the beginning of
the flood emergency until classes re-
sumed at the University on Monday.

Among the University women who
volunteered for service were Louise
Jackson at Heinz Settlement; Irene.
Kocerha, VVoods Run Settlement;
Jeanette Roscnthal, Katherine Karuzo,
Mary Ross and Grace Ellis, Irene’
Kaufmann Settlement. Other women
whose names are not available, also
volunteered. _

Miss Jane Shurmer, instructer in
physical education, and Dr. Keifer, as-
sistant in the department of physical
education, also aided the Red Cross
in stricken areas.

Engineers Break Precedent
To Award Keys To Seniors

For the ﬁrst time in the history of
the organization, the Engineering As-
sociation cabinet has awarded keys to
senior members.

Eight members of the EA received
these awards at I/Vednesday’s meeting.
.’he keys, passed out by William Hall,
CE36, president, with no attempt at
ceremony, signify two years’ service
on the cabinet.

With but one dissenting vote, it was
decided that President Hall should re-
ceive key number one. Franklin Hock-
ensmith, ME36, treasurer of the EA,
was awarded key number two. Other
seniors to receive keys were: Robert
Kerr, EE; Robert Smith, AE; Wil-
liam Britton, ChE; Edward Shepherd,
IE; Elmer Messner, Phys&E; and
Robert Stoll, Phys&E.

Baldwin To Speak Tuesday
At Historical Group Meeting

Dr. Leland D. Baldwin, lecturer in
history and assistant director of the
\‘v'estern Pennsylvania Historical Sur-
vcy, will present a paper on “Charles
Dickens in Western Pennsylvania” at
the regular monthly meeting of the
Historical Society of Western Pennsyl-
vania in the Historical Building at 8
o’clock next Tuesday evening.

Speaking on the same program is
;\[r. Frank C. Harper, secretary-mana-
ger of the Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce, who will give an address on
“The Importance of History to Our
Generation.”

the@

Among those who aided authorities in
the flooded districts were Charles Hol-
stein, Sidney Friedman, Roger Hanson,
and Robert Metosky.

Additional students and faculty mem-
bers of undetermined number aided
the work in rescuing and protecting
life and property in the district.

Fraternity Boys Hustle

Students in the division of social
work of the‘ department of sociology
were called upon to aid the work in
the settlement houses crowded with
refugees, especially the Woods Run
Settlement. Many NYA workers were
transferred to the downtown section.

Fraternities came in for their share
when they were asked by the munici-
pal water department to warn resi-
dents that water was to be shut off.
\/Vorkers from the 13 fraternities cov-
ered a considerable portion of the East
End district.

Because of the extensive damage
done by the waters to electrical and
other mechanical equipment, 20 sen-
iors in electrical and mechanical en-
gineering have been given a two-
weeks’ leave by Dean E. A. Holbrook
to aid in the restoration of service in
the Triangle.

Under the direction of the Red
Cross, the portion of the Stadium under
the bowl has been allocated as a stor-
age and repair shop for damaged fur-
niture. Equipment for extensive re-
pairs and painting will be installed.

The Stadium basketball pavilion
served as housing for some of the Na-
tional Guardsmen when other quarters
were ﬁlled to capacity.

Dr. Wholey Talks To Prc-Med Group
On Importance Of Psychiatric Work

“Psychiatry is just as much a science
as are chemistry, physics, mathematics
or other kindred branches.”

Such was the opinion expressed by
Dr. C. C. VA/'holey, assistant professor
in psychiatry, in a talk to Chi Rho Nu,
honorary pre-medical fraternity.

“More and more, the psychiatrist
and the ‘psychologist are penetrating
farther and farther into the maze of
grey matter which we know as the
brain,” he said. “One man, the neu-
rologist, is working for a fuller knowl-
edge of the nervous system and its
problems, and the other man, the psy-
chiatrist, studies, only the mind.”

Dr. VVholey warned the group against
too early specialization in the medical
field. He believes that before deciding
to_ specialize in a certain branch, the
student should have mastered prac-
tically all the requirements of a gen-
eral practitioner. This general knowl-
edge is best obtained by completing
the regular pre-medical course offered

by most colleges. This done, he states,
the student should have a clear pers-
pective before him. Choose the most
congenial ﬁeld.

“The thing that all prospective doc-
tors and specialists should remember
is that medicine is an art, just as mu-
sic, writing, painting and the like are
arts,” he added.

“As a rule, people are beginning to
realize that cure can be effected
through the mind as well as the body,”
he concluded. “The importance of
medical hygiene can be estimated when
we realize that more people are put
in hospital beds because of mental and
nervous diseases than all other ailments
put together. In the future, we hope
to impress upon people that the proper
use of the mind is just as essential to
health as is the proper care of the
body. We hope to accomplish this
through psychiatry.”

Next ﬁfth hour VVednesday, Chi Rho
Nu will have as guest speaker Dr.
Samuel I/Villiams, professor of zoology.

Nickel For The News Will

last week’s disastrous Hood. The
Pitt News will turn over to the Red
Cross all proceeds from the sale of
its papers Monday and Wednesday.

The nickel you pay for the papers,
when piled with nickels to represent
every single copy which will be
distributed during these two days,
should make an amount which the
campus will be proud to present in
this emergency.

CRAWFORD ELABORATES
ON CURRICULUM PLANS
PROPOSED FOR COLLEGE

System Holds Many Advantages;
Will Require 1.0 Average
To Graduate In 1939

By Herbert Rackoff

The long—awaited change in the cur-
riculum of the College will be put into
effect beginning with next year’s fresh-
man class, according to information
released from the oﬁice of the College
Monday.

Under the newly adopted plan, the
student will engage for his ﬁrst two
years in general study in what will be
designated as the “lower division,”
after which he will be permitted to
specialize in the ﬁelds of his own
choosing in the “upper division.” The
upper group can be entered only after
a student has attained junior rank.

This plan, according to Dr. Stanton
C. Crawford dean of the College, will
“make provision for the student who
comes to college with no well-deﬁned
interest or plan, and who desires to
take general courses until his judg-
ment can mature. Others who have al-
ready selected their professional or
vocational ﬁeld for specialization, and
who want to devote as much time as
possible to cultural development, or
who can afford to take only two years
of college work will also be beneﬁted
by this new program.”

Freshmen May Advance Early

As announced in the newly published
bulletin of the College, there will be
several new features aﬁecting students
in the lower division. Placement tests
will be given to freshmen who desire
to enter sophomore courses. This will,
according to Dr. Crawford, in no way
shorten the regular four years of col-
lege, but will give the student a chance
to take more advanced work.

Pre-medical students will be in-
cluded in this new College division.
\/Vorking with regard to the judgment
of the admissions committee of the
School of Medicine, the curriculum
will not be top-heavy with science,
but will include such courses as Eng-
lish, history, mathematics, and langu-
ages. Four year pre-medical courses
will still be offered. There will be no
block schedules for pre-medical stu-
dents, however.

A special curriculum in the lower
division will be an enlargement of the
survey group. It was formerly desig-
nated as an “alternative freshman cur-
riculum.” In the sophomore year, stu-
dents in this group will choose basic
courses in the ﬁelds in which they ex-
pect to do further work.

Government Course Included

Science courses of the cultural type
will be available for students who de-
sire to major in non-scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
These courses will be given in biology,
chemistry, geology, and physics. Pre-
education students will continue as be-
fore, being included in the lower divi-
sion of the College. The new Govern-
ment Service course is to be included
in the College officially for the ﬁrst
time, although it was announced late
last spring.

To be admitted into the upper divi-
sion, a student must have earned a .75
quality point average in the lower
group. In the upper division the work
progresses deﬁnitely along three lines:
training in varied ﬁelds of knowledge,
development of particular interests, and
study concerning problems of signiﬁ-
cance to human progress.

A new feature is the permitting of
women to take 30 credits toward grad-
uation in a recognized school of nurs-
ing.

1.0 Average For Graduation

By recent action a quality point aver-
age of 1.0 will be necessary for grad-
uation, that is, a straight “C” average.
In fairness to students now enrolled,
this will be applied on a sliding scale,
as follows: .75 for the class of 1936,
.83 in 1937, .92 in 1938, and 1.0 begin-
ning in 1939.

According to Dr. Crawford, it will
take some years to effect all the _cur-
ricular changes needed to express the
philosophy back of the separation of
upper and lower divisions. “The plan,”
he said, “will give the student time
for gaining general viewpoints, major
understandings, and broad cultural ex-
perience. There is opportunity for dis-
ciplining judgment and obtaining per-
spective . . . there is hope -that students
may become eligible to join the com-
pany of educated men.”

Dr. McFadden To Substitute
For Dr. Elterich At Forum

“Some Results of a Study of the Ob-
jective Type of Examination,” will be
given by Dr. John H. McFadden,
assistant professor of psychology, to
the Psychology Forum, Monday at
4:30 o’clock in Room 308, Alumni Hall.

Dr. McFadden is substituting for Dr.
Theodore Elterich, assistant professor
of pediatrics and lecturer in psychol-
ogy, who is recovering from an attack
of pneumonia.

TESTING PITT ’S HEART

Now that the chaos and confusion of Pittsburgh’s
worst ﬂood disaster has subsided, we may realize
the depth of destruction and loss it has incurred.

For that reason The Pitt News feels conﬁdent
that students and faculty of the University will res-
pond almost unanimously to our attempt at gather-
ing a contribution to represent this campus in the
Red Cross emergency fund.

While the ﬂood was it its worst, virtually every-
one was liberal in donations of food, clothing, and
services. That stage now has passed, but the effects
of the disaster will for a long time be a drag upon
certain communities.

All aids else being given their due, the help needed
most is money. To the average student, accustomed
to spending several times the amount in now re-
stricted downtown amusement centers, ﬁve cents for
a most worthy cause will be a small charge.

We are fully aware that the total of our circula-
tion Monday and Wednesday will reﬂect the heart
of the University of Pittsburgh campus.

We’re certain we shall not be disappointed in judg-
ing the goodness of that heart.

A CAMPUS VIEWPOINT

On The American Youth Act

While ﬂood waters were sweeping over Pittsburgh last
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, in Washington there
was a Senate hearing on the American Youth Act. This
measure, all important to the greater number of students,
will, if passed, alleviate the needs of unemployed youth
and provide educational opportunities for high school,
college, and post graduate students.

The National Youth Administration has served a sig-
niﬁcant purpose in ofﬁcially recognizing the American
youth problem, but it is hopelessly inadequate to meet the
demands of the 2,000,000 needy students and unemployed
youth. The American Youth Act is offered as a realistic
correction and supplement to the NYA, and as_ a means
of continuing and amplifying the original objectives.

It will be clarifying to outline brieﬂy the improvements
the American Youth Act has to offer over the National
Youth Administration:

1. The NYA reaches only a very small part of high
school and college students, and of unemployed youth;
The AYA will beneﬁt the great mass of needy youth
between the ages of 16 and 25.

2. The NYA faces near exhaustion of its resources;
the AYA will create new funds by a justified taxation
of inheritances, gifts, and individual and corporation
incomes of $5,000 a year or over.

3. Under the NYA, projects have been assigned in a
slipshod, haphazard manner conducive to the creation
of many useless and socially harmful jobs; the AYA
will propose lists of projects which are educational and
beneﬁcial to the community.

4. The NYA has been administered by appointees
too often under political control; the AYA will operate
under joint administrative boards of representatives from
youth organizations, organized labor, and local social
service, education, and consumers’ groups.

It is with these improvements in mind, and with cin-
phasis placed upon the knowledge that the American
Youth Act will reach all needy young people between the
ages of 16 and 25 (students or Workers), that every Uni-
versity organization——Student-Faculty Association, clubs,
social fraternities, honoraries—every present NYA Worker,
and every individual student should give whole—hearted
support to the bill.

This support, to be niost effective, may be expressed by
wire or letter to Representative L. Palmisano, at the
House Ofﬁce Building, Washington, D. C., for the bill
will be considered by the Committee on Education in the
House of Representatives.—RUTI-I SOCHATOFF.

‘1'he Pitt News

Intercollegiate

By Fred Mccamic

Pittpourri, Please Note
Until 1928, a complete list of the cadets and their
_nartners was published in the student paper of Virginia
Poiytechnic Institute before a dance.

 

We’ll Take A Spoon
At a chicken and ice cream dinner for women at Sy-
racuse. four girls did away with Emily Post by wield-
ing chop sticks throughout the meal.

 

What They Won’t Do!

WTCN, a radio station near the University of Minne-
sota. is sponsoring the broadcast of a satire on college
courses. The sonorous rhythm of professorial lectures
will be set to music in a. burlesque of six courses. The
series is entitled “a rhythm lecture from the college
swing” and the first program is a take-off on a course in
astronomy. To conform with the subject, numbers such
as “Moon Glow" and “Dark on Observatory Hill” will be
presented.

Phones Come High

The telephones in women’s dormitories at Syracuse
have been raised two feet by University officials. This
was done to reduce some phone calls from hour-long
conversations to unromantic chats of long-distance di-
mensions.

Are Their Faces Red?

Most of the students in the School of Architecture at
Syracuse University are in trouble with the U. S. Gov‘-
ernment because of a misuse of the mails. Some one
suggested that they make a bomb out of an old alarm
clock which one of them found. It was packed with
sugar, water, cotton and two dead ﬂashlight batteries.
Someone suggested that they send it to the Chancellor
of Syracuse who was then vacationing in Florida. Some-
one put the word “comrade” on the box just before it
was mailed and it was that word that aroused the sus-
picions of the officials.

When the students arrived at the police station for
arraignment they were given the usual treatment. After
signing the police blotter, their belts and neckties were
taken from them to prevent suicide in a moment of re-
morse.

More than 25 of the students signed a letter of apology
that was sent by air mail to the Chancellor in Miami.

Cheating Statistics

A questionnaire was- submitted to ﬁve representative
Syracuse professors asking from which class the most
students cribbed. One said he suspected the juniors and
seniors more than the freshmen and sophomores, while
two answered that freshmen were the worst oﬁenders.
The ﬁve professors agreed, however, on one point: that
as many good students as poor students crib.

A New Marathon

At the University of California at Les Angeles there
is a contest to determine which male student can raise
the healthiest beard during a six-day period.

All those who compete sign up in the university
store and registrants are given free pipes and tobacco
for the week. One sample hair is plucked from the
chin of each contestant for the judging that is in
charge of a committee headed this year by Joe E.
Brown.

The Little Rascal!

Prof. Carlyle Scott, head of the department of music
at the University of Minnesota, says it is quite all right
if your brothers and sisters don’t like to do their regular
practice at the piano. In fact, Professor Scott broke
down and confessed that when he was a youngster he
used to set the clock ahead and climb out the window.

 

Make Ours A Blonde

Patrons of the cafeteria at the University of California
at Berkeley no» longer order their coffee “with” or “with-
out.” Adopting the method long in use in the paint and
nail polish industries, the store inaugurated a coffee
color-chart to assure the customers of getting the right
amount of cream in their coffee.

Those who prefer black coffee will order “Ethiopian.”
He who drinks his with just a smattering of cream will
ask for “Joe Louis.” “Sun-Tan” will designate a mod-
erate use of cream, while “Golden Bear" shall indicate a
rather ﬂagrant flavoring. “Boston,” a honey colored
beverage, should satisfy the most fanatical cream en-
thusiast.

No Tooting Tour

For the first time in live years the band of the Uni’-
versity of Minnesota will not go on a tour during the
spring vacation. This year, because heavy winter snows
have made roads treacherous for travel by bus, there
will be no tour such as the six-day one through six
states which they took last year.

Yes, Indeed!

The men at Michigan State have added their say—so to
what the ideal coed should be.

“A good dancer; fair and honest; be prompt; possess
a sense of humaness; have poise and charm; be intel-
ligent; have social qualities and femininity; and be able
to control her temper.”

Maybe it Cuts Costs?

Two books written by professors at the University of
Minnesota are being printed by the University of Minne-
sota press.

Swimming Carnival Postponed

 

By Harry E. Robinson

Outstanding scholastic swimmers from Pennsylvania and Ohio are all
set to make the water up in Trees Pool resemble the Alleghenyriver at ﬂood
stage tomorrow afternoon and evening when the ;?2I’Id.I.,II11VCl‘S1l’.y iiiterscholastic
meet is called to order by Pat Corr, varsity swnninmg coach. ' Also included
on the day’s water program will be the University championships, which will
have for the ﬁeld the varsity and freshman Illefmell

Starting at 1 o’clock, natators fromC°‘

at least 11 high schools will spend the
afternoon in qualifying events, and the
evening program calls for ﬁnals in all
events including the Pitt title contests.
More high school entries are expected
to row in, rivers permitting, before
the ﬁrst trials in the 40-yard fr€€StY1€-

Thus far teams from Eric Tech_, Can-
ton McKinley, Erie Strong Vincent,
Cleveland Heights, Duquesne, Clair-
ton, Taylor Allderdice, Homestead,
Central Catholic, South Hills, and Tur-
tle Creek have been entered. _ Erie
Tech’s outﬁt, defending champs, 1S ex-
pected to be pressed by Canton Mc-
Kinley, 1934 titleholders, and Eric
Strong Vincent for ﬁrst honors. _

While scholastic natators are having
their ﬁeld day, Coach Corr’s Pitt swim-
mers will be winding up a fairly suc-
cessful season with the individual
championships at stake. All variety
events with the exception of the fancy
diving trials, which will be held in the
afternoon, will be contested for in the
evening.

Four titleholders will return to de-

I fend their laurels, including Captain

Russ Lindberg, Tom Locke, Tom An-
derson, and Red McQuillan. Lindberg
holds records in the backstroke and

Among the freshman swimmers who
will provide the varsity with uneasy
moments are Walt Nowotny and Ber-
nie Lelake. Nowotny will be among the
favorites to capture first honors in the
sprint events while Lelake will prob-
ably press Lindberg in the backstroke.

DR. GEORGE KOWALLIS
PAYS VISIT T0 CAMPUS

Former Pitt Cage Star And Coach
Reports Cold In Minnesota

News of the coming of the ﬂood
somewhat overshadowed news of the
coming of Dr. George S. Kowallis
to Pittsburgh last week. Dr. Kowallis,
former assistant director of the men’s
student health service and assistant

varsity basketball coach, is in the city
on a short leave of absence from the
Mayo Brothers clinic at Rochester,
Miiiiiesota.

“Golly,” drawled Dr. Kowallis in the
typical Dr. Kowallis drawl, “it was 40
below out there, but you didn’t notice
it. I understand you folks were stopped
by 20 below here. Why, golly, out there
the bo_vs and girls go ice—skating at 10
and 20 below and have a great time.

“It’s a dry sort of cold, though,” ad-
mitted the doctor, “that’s why it’s not
noticed so much. Just the same, when
the mercury crawled back to zero we
thought it was spring. At least I did.”

For the ﬁrst time since he can re-
member, the former Pitt ﬂoor star and
brother of Dockey Kowallis, freshman
cage coach, went without a full round
of basketball the past season. He saw
but one game, a Minnesota-Illinois en-
counter, and on the basis of that one
performance he is willing to say that
the Gophers are much better football
players than basketeers.

Dr. Kowallis is going at full speed in
an attempt to visit his host of friends
in the vicinity before he leaves for
Rochester tomorrow, there to resume
duties of the fellowship awarded him
last fall.

Grunt, Gman Performers Learn
Holds For Annual Contests

Those strange sounds that have been
coming out of the Stadium dressing
rooms recently have ﬁnally been ex-
plained. Training for the Intramural
wrestling tournament has begun.

Scheduled for an opening this week,
the mat round-robin was pushed for-
ward to VVednesday, April 1. With the
added kilowatts that the extended train-
ing period should bring, the grapplers
will have more light and time for prac-
ticing up on the ﬁner points of coni-
petitive wrestling.

According to Martin J. Feely, direc-
tor of Intramural athletics, all that is
needed to enter is a pair of rather well
developed biceps, a pair of any kind
of trunks, and a signed entry blank.
As a matter of fact, the entry list is
certain to be ﬁlled with a batch of
novices. Those who have won num-
erals or letters in wrestling are ex-

cluded.

Top Schedules On
New Sports Card

Schedules of the three major sports
of the spring season announced by the
Stadium oﬂice this week reveal that the
golfers have been ﬁxed up with the
classiest schedule. The linksmen will
swing through the east coast on two
trips, stopping as far east as Green-
wich, Connecticut, and move into the
niid-west when they trade shots with
the V\-Iestern Reserve putters near the
end of a lengthy 17-match campaign.

Tennis ranks second in number of
contests with plans calling for an even
dozen engagements. The track team
will travel three times to Philadelphia
and once as far west as Milwaukee in
an 11-meet program. Coach Olson's
spiked shoe runners will probably
cover the most road miles before the
conclusion of the season with their
frequent jaunts to the Quaker City.

Third Interscholastic Track
Meet Carded For Tomorrow

Pitt trackmen say “so long" to the indoor cindcrs and boards tomorrow
in new roles when they play host as oiiicials to 12 of the outstanding spiked

shoe teams in the tri-state district.

The event is the third running of the

University of Pittsburgh Interscholastic invitational indoor relay carnival.

Thin clad performers representing 12?‘)

teams toe their marks in the trials.
scheduled for 11 o’clock tomorrow
morning. Finals in the four relay and
seven track events are set for 2:30
o'clock in the indoor track. house.
Coach Dave Stewart’s Sharon Ex-
press trackmen will not be back to
defend their team title won in the sec-
ond annual school classic last year.
However. the Academy High aces
from Eric, winner of the ﬁrst title two
years ago, will return for action after
a year's lay-off and rate the favorite
position to repeat that 1934 victory.
Connellsville, last year's dark horse,
holds a similar position this year,
probably because the relative strength
of other teams is pretty much of an
unknown quantity. The East Pales-
tine, Ohio, entry is the only 0ut-0f-
state team that has signiﬁed an in-
tention to compete. Erie East, along
with the other Erie entry, Academy,
boasts a strong squad of sprinters and
middle-distance runners.

District teams, in addition to Con-
nellsville, include Breiitwood, Georges
Township, Elizabeth, Langley, Pea-

body, Union City, Canonsburg and

jcifcrsoii Township.

F' ‘e new records were hung up in
the 1935 attraction. Poole, who com-
peted last year in the University handi-
caps accounted for a new standard in
the 50-yard dash, breezing through a
5.5 seconds sprint in the semi-ﬁnals of
that event. The red-headed Canons-
burg sprinter also ran anchor man on
his school’s eight-lap relay team that
establisliecl a new mark of two minutes
and 20.3 seconds.

Tliomzis. Sharon High vaunter,
cleared 11 feet, six and seven-eights
inches in the pole vault. Connellsville
and Clairton accounted for the other
new records in the relays.

olid steel over your head certainly makes

ment likc many others has resulted from

General Motors. Few people realize the
initial cost of developing the “Turret Top,”
and it is only the fact that it is used on mil-

overhauling and reconditioning next
Tuesday afternoon and evening. The
occasion is the annual Evaluation Con-
terence, when group members study
the association program in an objec-
tive manner.

During the past two weeks. ea_Ch
YVV committee met and reviewed its
work. Each considered such questions
as what work of value had been done,
and what work was not of value; how
the committee had advanced the main
purposes of the organization; how it
might next year more clearly express
the purpose of the YVV; suggestions for
more ﬂexibility in committee set-up;
and speciﬁc problems to be considered
at Leader's Institute. _

These questions will be summarized
by Jane Kahler, Ed37, immediately fol-
lowing a brief opening worship serv-

_'ice led by Sara Marie \Vood, Ed37, at

the ﬁndings of committees 1S expected.

Consider Joint Projects

Following a report on future ﬁnance
and general policy, submitted by Mrs.
W. VV. Mendenhall, a member of the
advisory board, the conference will con-
sider several main questions that will
arise out of the afternoon discussion.
Chief among these will be a considera-
tion of cooperation and joint projects
with the YMCA, the problem of be-
coming more vocal about group con-
victions, committee organization, and
program simpliﬁcation. Miss Marie
Russ, advisory board member, will lead
the evening discussion.

In conclusion, Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women, who also is a
member of the advisory board, will
review the work of the freshman re-
ligious program, which has centered
about a consideration of “Spiritual
Poise.”

Tuesday’s event is open to any YW

tion policies for the next year. Reser-
vations for the dinner, to post 35 cents,
must be made in the Y ofﬁce by Mon-
