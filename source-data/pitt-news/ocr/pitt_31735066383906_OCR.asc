Settlement reason

Nyden:"CouIdn't Win in Court"

By RICH HARRY and
MAGGIE McKAY
Pitt News Staff
Former Pitt sociology professor
Paul Nyden yesterday disclosed his
reasons for accepting a cash
settlement from the University in
exchange for his guarantee not to
take Pitt to court over his contract

cash settlement, although Nyden
admitted it "was equivalent to
several year’s salaries. Bothsides
of the case are under court
injunction not to reveal details of the
settlement under penalty of con-
tempt of court. '

Speaking at a press conference
called by the Western Pennsylvania
Citizens for Justice at Pitt, Nyden
cited Dr. Sharon Johnson's recent,
aborted attempt to press litigation
against the University for its
decision not to grant her tenure in
1971. Johnson, a senior research
assistant
Medicine, alleged sex discrimina-
tion in her suit.

.30-.‘rIt’s difficult for faculty mem-

in Pitt’s School of

bets to win casesonce they get into
the courts,” Nyden said. “Cases
must be won on the campus.”

Nyden attempted to overturn the
sociology department’s decision not
to renew his contract at the
University level by utilizing student
protests and speeches in his behalf.

In August, he ﬁled suit in Federal
court after Chancellor Posvar
withdrew a 15-month contract offer
that would have placed Nyden
under the direct supervision of
Faculty of Arts and Science Dean
.Jerome Rosenberg.

Asked if he thought he sold out
his supporters by accepting the cash
offer, Nyden replied, “If I’d felt
there was a likelihood of establish-
ing legal precedents, I would have
continued. I came to the conclusion
that the relationship of forces was
such that I couldn't win in court.”

Nyden said his struggle with the
University ' indicated Pitt was
“extremely conservative and rac-
ist.”

He also said faculty unionization
is needed at Pitt to protect faculty
rights and claimed that freedom of
speech on the part of professors is
non-existent.

“The grievance procedure is not
binding and until unionization
succeeds, professors will continue

J to have problems,” Nyden" said.

After Nyden spoke, Issac Saxon,
president of the Western Pennsyl-
vania citizens for Justice at Pitt,
invited professor Patrick Ntukogo , a
self-proclaimed Marxist in the black
studies department, to speak.
Ntukogo’s tenure decision has been
delayed by the Administration. He
charged that Rosenberg ignored a
favorable departmental tenure
recommendation and bypassed
procedures for a review comittee
made up of members of the
University Senate’s tenure council.
The review committee is required
by Senate by-laws.

“Rosenberg refused to give me
any reasons for the denial: He
wired me that I had 21 days to ask
for the reasons and that he had 14

According to Saxon, the Western
Pennsylvania Citizens for Justice at
Pitt will circulate a petition calling
for a public hearing in Pittsburgh
and an investigation by the State
Legislature into the amount of
student tuition and tax dollars spent
by the University in discrimination
cases and suppression of unions.

In a release, the group stated,
“We call upon the Legislature to
open the books and disclose the
amount of student tuition and tax
dollars spent in these ways. We
also are concerned with Adminis-
tration pay-offs, slush funds,
personal misuse of public funds and
nepotism.

We firmly oppose a tax hike, a
tuition hike or any retrenchment
policy. We believe adequate funds
exist, but are being misused,” the
release said.

SGB Allocates Travel Funds

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Student Government Board
members Chip Hubbard and Dave
Hesidence will journey to the
student lobby at Penn State"
Monday, on the strength of
Wednesday’s SGB vote to fund
transportation to the two-day
session.

The four-school lobby, still in an
embryonic stage, will deal with
legislative action of student con-
cern including ﬁnancial aid, bill-
passage and state appropriations.
The lobby is expected to reach full
strength by next year.

In its unanimous decision, the
SGB approved $160 in travel costs
enabling Hubbard and Hesidence
to work with other student
governments at Penn State on the
group's constitution. budget and
lobbying strategy. '

The two Pitt board members also
are expected to discuss strategy to
generate support for increased
funding of higher education when
the legislature reconvenes in two
weeks.

Also represented in the lobby
will be Pennsylvania’s three other
state-related universities, Temple,
Lincoln, and Penn State.

In a brief interview following
Wednesday's SGB meeting, Hub-
bard and Hesidence stressed the

importance of student pressure
on the legislature to increase
appropriations.

If we get the students involved,”
Hesidence said, “our chances are
good. If not, we don’t have a
prayer‘ in the world.”

Hubbard said students are not
“really aware” of the impact of the
legislature’s eventual decision but
added this should change once they
are presented with a lobbying
strategy. T

“We hope students will be
enthused to_ lobby and convince the
legislature and the people of the
state that funding higher education
is in their best interests,” Hubbard
said.

He added that “strong-arm

tactics” used in the past two years
have failed to hold the line on
tuition. The emphasis this year wil
be on personal contacts with state
legislators through letters and
telephone calls. a
e “We must show the legislature
we’re educated persons who are
willing to go about this in a
professional manner,” Hesidence
said.

In other business Wednesday,
the SGB passed a motion to allow
the Student Government Alloca-

Posvar Calls Leader's

Chancellor Posvar labelled as
“ridiculous” charges made by
high-ranking Republican Pennsyl-
vania legislator that state-related
universities must share the blame
for their ﬁscal problems.

House GOP Caucus Chairman

I Samuel E. Hayes said Wednesday

presidents of ﬁve of the state-rela-
ted institutions did little last month
while the Legislature passed a
budget that provided no money for
the state—related colleges.

“Educators are the poorest of
lobbyists,” Hayes said at a meeting
with representatives from the
universities involved. “All other

tions Committee to approve annual
budgets under $100. The motion
also will apply to budget modiﬁca-
tions under $250 and emergency
requests of less than $100, the
board ruled. V

The SGB also voted to hire a
secretary through the University’s
work-study program. The secre-
tary will work 12 hours a week.

SGB member Gary Tweed gave
an account of a project designed to
study the restructuring of Student
Government and the re-evaluation
of itslconstitution. Tweed said he
plans to solicit information that is
in “historic perspective” from
administrators as to the operations
of past boards.

“The constitution, since

groups with an -interest in the
budget were here. They were out
front.”

“That’s ridiculous,” Posvar said
in answer to Hayes’ charges. “We
fought and argued‘ against ‘it (the
budget) for days. It's all in the
transcript, if they just look.

“The general consensus from
Harrisburg is that Pitt will get their
money after a difficult fight,”
Posvar continued. “Nobody’s
going to say Pitt won't get money in
the end.”

Posvar spent eight “construc-
tive” hours in Harrisburg Wednes-
day, meeting with Governor Shapp
and legislators.

 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the "University of Pittsburgh"

Going Nowhere

The Student Government Board has been creating a great deal of
news lately, especially for a group that has done little of a
substantive nature during this time. K

Recent activities in the student government suite have not been of
the variety that help students. When not accepting resignations
from its members, the now five-man board has been axing standing

committee chairmen and standing committees.

That could be

good, if it meant SGB was going to assume responsibility and work
to amke things better for students, but we’re not so sure that IS the

case.

SGB’s recent moves involving the Programming and Legal
Awareness Committees (LAC) may, in fact, be the beginning Of 3
power grab that could lead student services into disarray. The
board’s record to date gives us the impression Ahmie Baum may
have been correct in his belief SGB was moving too slowly—-if at
all——on important issues. We’re still waiting for SGB’s response to
last summer’s tuition increase. And the stated reason for Bruce

_Stephen’s ouster from the Legal Awareness Committee’s

chair—inaccessibility during the summer—just doesn't hold water
coming from a board that couldn’t muster a quorum during those
same months. If an SGB member attempted to contact Stephen in
July, he must have done it from home. ‘
This does not imply Stephen should not have been dismissed.
However, SGB shouldhave Offered better proof that its facts were

accurate—by giving Stephen a chance
charges——before dismissing him as chairman of LAC.

to counter its

We hope we are proved and that SGB assumes its new roles in a
manner that benefits students, but this apparently will require a
change of course from the five remaining board members.

Imperialists Warn of Revolution

The severe ﬁnancial situation of
the University of Pittsburgh has
been giving headaches ' to Pitt
administrators and trustees, the
poor souls, for some time now, but
lately they’ve been suffering from
downright migraines. What is the
cause of-their illness? Is it because
their ‘ ‘funding proposals have been
slashed by the Republicans and the
Democrats,” as some people have
been saying? This causes them
slight dizziness but is not their main
concern. They are not so worried
about borrowing money.

Certainly, people like J. H.
Higgins, chairman of Mellon Bank,
Bob R. Dorsey, ex-chairman of Gulf
Oil, R. Heath Larry, vice-chairrnan
of U.S. Steel, Henry L. Hillman of
National Steel, Pittsburgh National
Bank, and General Electric fame,
and other Pitt trustees see proﬁt in
the idea of borrowing money from
their own corporations in the name
of Pitt so Pitt students can pay the
debts plus huge interest. Mellon
Bank likes to borrow money from
Mellon Bank if students will pay
their debts for them. This is not
their main worry. The people who
run Pitt for the corporations are
taking so many aspirin because the
international situation is leading to
an inevitable crisis for the
corporations themselves.

The multinational corporations
that own Pitt fear the great disorder
around the world. The world
system of monopoly capitalism,
imperialism, is in serious trouble.

An Always-taxing Problem

By DAN MULHOLLAND

We are all familiar with the old
saying, “There is nothing certain
but death and taxes.” Few other
observations on the human condi-
tion have been more cogent. But
just as modern medicine has
enabled us to postpone the grim
reaper’s visit for a longer period of
time, some sorely needed legisla-
tion also could enable us to cope
with his counterparts at the IRS. It
would take only four simple steps,
not the thousands of pages of
legalisticmumbo jumbo that make
up the present tax code, to insure a
mor equitable system for all
concerned. Here they are.

STEP NUMBER ONE: ELIMIN-
ATE THE CORPORATE INCOME

TAX. -.  «is-weunrently - 1- being i

considered by some elements
within the Carter Administration,
but it is unlikely any action will be
taken on it. At the present time,
corporations are taxed at the rate of
48 percent on earnings in excess of
$50,000 and at a 22 percent rate for
earnings below that figure. The
effective rate of this tax is
somewhere around 37 percent. This
means that more than -one-third is
skimmed off the top before it can be
distributed to the shareholders or
put back into the business. If this
tax was eliminated, corporations
would be able to funnel this money
into capital expansion, which would
mean hundreds of thousands of new
jobs. Inflation also would be
stemmed somewhat, since corpora-
tions would no longer have to tack

their tax bill - onto the prices

consumers pay for their products.

domination, there is now revolu-
tion. In Africa, Latin America, the
Middle East, all around the world,
people are rising up in a united front
against the imperialists. The U.S.
used to super-exploit the vast riches
of the third world, stealing
resources from the land while
paying the people pennies a day and
forcing them into miserable labor
camps. But the heroic people of the
third world have been. victorious
time and time again, kicking the tar
out of U.S. imperialism in Korea,
Vietnam, and now in Africa, where
the revolutionary struggles are
winning victory after victory.

When the U.S.S.R. tries sneaking
into the third world, calling
themselves natural allies -of the
oppressed peoples, they are
exposed as socialists only in words
and imperialists in actions and are
given the same treatment as the
U.S. With a consistent record of

acts of treachery following words of ,

support, the main enemy of the
world's peoples, the social imper-
ialism of the U.S.S.R., is as doomed
as the imperialism of the U.S.

The irresistible trend of revolu-
tion—this is what is causing all the
headaches of the multinational
corporations that run Pitt and the
universities across the country.
Cities, states and governmental
institutions are running out of
money. Without the super-proﬁts
from the third world, the basis of
our economy, the thievery must be
conducted elsewhere. The U.S. , the
top dog of the world, is losing
ground steadily. The U.S.S.R. is in
a mad rush to become top dog but is
being exposed and defeated around
the world. Both superpowers have
been accumulating arms, arms and
more arms while talking about
detente and disarmament as their
rivalry sharpens and the threat of
world war continues to rise. The
hungry imperialists know that war
is a way out of their decay.

In the U.S., and we in Pittsburgh
know this very well, corporations
ﬁnd it cheaper to pick up and move
rather than adhere to environmen-
tal regulations, threatening to leave
thousands unemployed. With a
crisis like we are having, the
unemployed cannot even count on
welfare. This leaves thousands of
angry people with nothing to lose. If
Pitt, the largest employer in the
area, were to close down, the
students and workers would find no
jobs. The reserve labor force, once

partially soaked . up by the

University, would be out of the ‘

classroom, out of the dorms, * out in
the street with nothing to lose and
everything to win. With the welfare
reforms no longer sufficient, the
workers and students_ could very
easily begin living up to their
revolutionary potential and nothing
scares the ruling class more.

World war becomes very proﬁt-
able in the eyes of the ruling class
who see the opportunity to
re-establish domination around the
world, get the reserve labor force
out of their hair and stimulate the
economy with wartime production.

Why do you think there has been
much talk of reinstating the draft?
Because war and proﬁt go together
under imperialism and the ruling
class sees war as their only way out.

The crisis at Pitt is part of a much
greater crisis, and those who fear an
increase of tuition would be wise to
see the whole scope of the problem.

in strategical unity and differ only in
tactics. Both see legislation as the
answer to the problem. Both view
the situation in the same way, a
much too narrow way at that. The
local situation is a manifestation of
the national situation, and that is a
manifestation of the international
situation. Our struggle is not
merely against tuition increases.

Our struggle is against the
system that is at the base of tuition
increases and all forms
exploitation—imperialism. The
revolutionary peoples of the third
world have dealt serious blows to
both U.S. and Soviet social
imperialism. Our struggle is the
same as theirs; we have the same
enemy. Our job is to ﬁght the ruling
class of this country as we support
the revolutionary struggles of the
peoples of the world and expose the
imperialist schemes for world war.
The servants of the ruling class who
sit on Pitt’s Board of Trustees are

beginning to sweat. Good. They ,

Q3?

An Always-

Taxing Problem

(Continued from Page 4)

MENT OF CAPITAL GAINS.
Capital gains are the ' income
derived from the sale or exchange of
a capital asset. These assets
include stocks, bonds and other
securities. At the present time,
these gains are taxed at one-half
the rate of regular income. These

- rates traditionally have favored the

rich at the expense of middle
income taxpayers, who are not as
likely to be capital investors. More-
over, the elimination of ’ the
corporate tax would give the rich an
added advantage, since their
holdings would no longer be taxed
at the corporate level. Therefore,
capital gains would have to be taxed
at the same rate as ordinary income.

STEP NUMBER THREE: ELIM-
INATE THE PROGRESSIVE RATE
SYSTEM. Ifthe capital gains rates
are going to be the same as regular
income, there will have to be some
other way to encourage investment

 in new enterprises. This could be

accomplished by taxing all tax-
payers, regardless of their income
level, at the same rate, probably
around 10 to 12 percent. This would
prevent any drastic drop in Federal
revenue while doing away with the
unfair and counterproductive pro-
gressive rate system, under which
taxpayers can be liable for as much
as 70 percent of their income. This
system penalizes ambition and hard
work while fostering indolence and
sloth.

STEP NUMBER FOUR: SIM-
PLIFY THE DEDUCTION PROVI-
SIONS. This could be accomplished
by eliminating all existing deduc-

tions, credits and exemptions and ,

replacing them with a single
personal exemption for the tax-
payer and his dependents. This
exemption would be equal to the
amount of money necessary to
provide the basic necessities of life.
Thus, a taxpayer only would be
taxed on income in excess of what
he and his family need to live on.
This would serve the same purpose
as the progressive system, without
penalizing those who get ahead
through personal industry. At the
same time, it also would put an end
to the labyrinth of deductions and
credits, which often serve special
groups at the-expense of the general
public. The tax code then would be
used to generate revenue, the
purpose for which it was intended,
rather than as a vehicle for
Byzantine policy planners or pork
barrel politicians. »
Admittedly, the actual imple-
mentation of these proposals would

be far more complex than this basic ‘

discussion, but it is not so difficult
as to be impossible. In fact, these
proposals are far simpler than any
proposal for comprehensive tax
reform yet advanced. If we are to
avoid the specter of conﬁscatory
taxation and creeping socialism,
which plagues the benighted
countries of western Europe, we
must adopt these proposals today.

London In the  
. Summer: Fog,

Cracked Pavements

By TOBI ROSEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

England’s version of the Bicen-
tennial, the Queen’s Silver Jubilee,
sent ﬂocks of tourists to the mother
country. But by this winter, the
last of the commerative plates,
ﬂags, tea cups and other memora-
bilia will have been shipped back to
a factory in Glasgow.

Now is an opportune time to start
planning a term or more of study
abroad. The Civil Aeronautics
Board has dropped international air
fares to a record low. The English
pound is still faltering—as the
pound decreases, the dollar be-
comes more valuable. And for
folks still shivering from last
winter's ice capades, the tempera-
ture rarely drops below 35 degrees.

However, be prepared to carry
an umbrella at all times. For the

I first two months of my term

abroad, I acquired an added
appendege more valuable than my
International Student ID.

But this isn’t a story on where to
ﬁnd the best hamburgers or how to
swallow a pint of Guiness beer with
a straight face.

London is an exciting, razzle-
dazzle place to live, work and
study. Something on the order of a
clean, safe New York City. But
here are just some of the myths I
encountered in the past seven
months.

Just because a man speaks with
an English accent, he isn’t David
Niven. Or Michael York. Or even
Ringo Starr.

Suave and sophistication wear
very thin when you hear the same
lines being used on the other side
of the Atlantic.

A sudden hush will not fall over a
room the moment you announce
yo u’re an American. Most Britans
will politely peg you for a
Canadian. It's rude to ask if you are
“from the states.”

Riding on top of a double-decker
bus isn't nearly as fun as expected.
And Londoners are funny travelers.
They will “queue” patiently for 15
minutes and then swarm the bus as
it approaches.

Everything isn’t a good buy.
Woolens, china, Waterford crystal
and theatre tickets are all
comparatively easy on the travel-
ers’ checks. But that’s about it as
bargains go. Even long-distance
train travel has gone up.

Everything on British television
is not the quality of “Upstairs,
Downstairs” or “Masterpiece
Theater.” Yes, even the BBC and
the commercial station, ITV, sink to
an occasional “Holmes and Y0-

he (or she) is carefully avoiding the
Sunday morning crowds at Speak-

Neo-Nazis have a passion for
soapbox oratories and the regular
hecklers give them a good workout.
But there is no room for serious
discussion. Nobody listens.

Fish-and-chips stands are nearly
extinct. There is one stand where
the ﬁsh must be lethally doused
with vinegar before tasting.
London is becoming a Big Mac
wasteland.

But fond memories of the eight
morning newspapers and the
singing pubs also clutter my
‘memories.

Foggy London is still the most
exciﬁng place in the world. But
after seven months, the cracks in
the sidewalk began to show.

Pitt Cafes Behind Times?

By MARK HALE

If these were the halcyon days of
Haight-Ashbury and acid rock, the
new lighting decor in the Towers
cafeterias would be up-to-date and
out of sight.

Could Pitt be 10 years behind the
times?

One may ﬁnd the multi-colored
cafteria lighting system rather
psychedelic——reminiscent of the
rebellious Pitt of 1970 rather than
the serious and practical University

of today.
Unfortunately, this year’s Pitt
students aren't going for the

psychedelic effect. As the serious
leaders of tommorrow. they seem
overwhelmingly unenthusiastic
about the prospects of eating their
meals under colored lights.

“Better than seeing what you’re"

eating," said one student before he
entered the cafeteria. “You can’t
tell the color of the food you're
eating," said another. “I'm going
to break the lights if they don't get

rid of them,” the student threat-
ened.

Of 100 students surveyed, 83
responded negatively to the new
cafeteria decor, 11 responded
positively and six said “It’s all
right.” Considering student
apathy in the 70’s, these are strong

.responses.

On the brighter side, Barbara
Bungo, University food service
manager, is enthusiastic about the
new decor.

“The lights are intended to give
the cafeteria a more relaxed
atmosphere. It was very sterile and
institutionalized. We want to warm
the place up—give it some
atmosphere,” Bungo said.

The new lights are only part of
the remodeling program the
cafeterias underwent during the
summer.

“All summer, the ceiling was
being painted light blue. This was
a difficult job because of all the
butter pads and toothpicks stu-

dents had ﬂicked up there,” Bungo
said.

Other cafeteria changes include
the striking designs and fabrics
adorning the outer walls. Art
students are planning to make
charcoal "sketches on the inside
wall and bright and attractive signs
will be posted to identify the food
lines.

As for the food. Bungo said her
staff has improved the quality of
the hamburger, now grills the bun.
has introduced a new salad bar that
offers a wide selection of condi-
ments and makes the best
doughnuts in town.

Bungo believes cafeteria dining
is “an important part of student
life. We try to make it interesting
and are open to student com-
ments.” There is a great deal of
interaction between her ofﬁce and
a student committee that weekly
discusses the food. service and
menus. Bungo said.

Benefits
To Vets
Offered

By SUSAN MORAN

At least 2,000 Pitt students
have served their country. These
students are veterans of military
service, which makes them eligible
for certain beneﬁts.

The primary beneﬁt is education.

Veterans who have served a
minimum of 180 consecutive days
of active duty are entitled to basic
education beneﬁts of $390 p_er
month, Veterans attending school
full time under the G.I. Bill are
entitled to an additional beneﬁt.
They are eligible for the "work-study
program of the Veterans Adminis-

tration. _
“Qualified veterans may earn up

to a maximum of $625 per term for
250 hours of service,” Veterans
beneﬁts counselor Dennis Duffy
said»-of the program. “Veterans
who work less than 250 hours will
be paid $2.50 per hour. The work
must be related to veterans affairs.
Work-study assignments will be
consistent with the student’s ﬁeld
of education. To the greatest
possible extent, students will be
matched with jobs related to their
majors. For example, a psychology
major would be assigned to the
psychology service.”

, Duffy emphasized that a veteran 

doesn't have to be in a medical
ﬁeld to get a job in the work-study
program. For the fall term,
however, the majority of job
opportunities exist in the Highland
Drive V.A. Hospital. A
Students participating in the
work-study program can tailor their
workto conform with their studies.
Applications are available at the

’ University of Pittsburgh Ofﬁce of

Veterans Affairs,
Hall.

“The work-study program gives
the veteran an opportunity to earn
money while attending school, as
well, as practical experience in his
f1_§?l_(_1.” Duff_yj concluded.

Greeks Honor
Posvar For Decade
of Service

ByJIMLEWIS

“All I can say, ” Pitt Chancellor
Wesley Posvar said, grasping the
sides of the oak dias, ‘ ‘is I’m moved
by everything tonight said and my
friendships with everyone here.”

Posvar spoke to some 400
trustees, students, alumni and
friends at the Panhellenic Associa-
tion-Intrafraternity Council (IFC)-
sponsored recognition dinner in
Schenley Hall ballroom.

The dinner, honoring Posvar for
his decade of service as the
University’s chief executive gave
the Chancellor the opportunity to
reminisce.

“I recall a bonﬁre two years
ago,” he said. “Instead of
kerosene, they put gasoline on the
wood. I got a little burned, but it
was fun.”

The affair was filled with
prominent guests, including Robert
E. Kirby, vice chairman of the Board
of Trustees, who joined in the
tribute.

“I remember the reaction of the
people who were screening the
applicants for chancellor 10 years
ago,” Kirby recalled. “Because he
was from West Point, they felt he
was in favor of war. But those who

believed he could do a good job
stuck to their guns—we insisted he
was the best—and after spending
time in the position, he proved they
were not dealing with a man in
warfare, but a man involved in
peace. A United Nations peace
force‘ in the Commons Room
Chancellor Posvar.”

Kirby continued to praise for
Posvar.

“There has been a tremendous
amount of work done here,” he
stressed. “We have a more
responsible university because of
Posvar. He is what the job
needs——an intellectual, a great
politician, a persistant salesman, a
foresighted planner, a financial
wizard—all that, plus,” Kirby said.

‘ ‘It’s important to remember that
Posvar liquidated the large debt he
inherited with the job,” he added.

Kirby further admired Posvar’s
accomplishments, including ‘main-
taining the Pitt Greek system. “Pitt
is richer for it,” he stated.

Panhellenic president Christine
Herrick and IFC president John
Powers agreed with Kirby.

“Both fraternal organizations
and the University prepare men and
women for service in society,”
Herrick said. “The purposes of

Pitt Greeks honored Dr. Wesley Posvar last night in recognition ofphis decade of service to the University.
Greeks, alumni and Board of Trustees members were among the hundreds in attendance. Before coming to Pitt,

Posvar was a tenured professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy and as a member of a long-range strategic

planning staff in the Pentagon.

both are the same—they are good
for each other. Chancellor Posvar
has done a fine job in understanding
this relationship.”

“There is love of this institution
by the Greeks,” Powers -said to
Posvar. “We respect and admire
you for have showing the same love
toward us.”

Posvar admitted to feeling good

about the honorary dinner, but did‘

not say it was his proudest

moment.

Public Theatre Looking For Student Turnout

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pittsburgh Public Theater
[will open its third season Sept. 28
with the comedy “Fathers Day.”
With most of their seats sold out
by season subscription, the non-
proﬁt organization is looking for
young people in its audiences.
“We’re very interested in develop-
ing a student audience,” said
Christine Hurst, public relations
director for the Public Theater.
Ben Shaktman, general director,
believes student participation in
theater is crucial. “The Public
Theater is trying to speak
particularly to students,” he said.
“For the past 10 years there has
been a down draft that Pittsburgh is
a bad cultural town.”

Shaktman claims this idea is no
longer true. If students believe it,
he said, “they are behind the
times.” ‘

Shaktman views theater as “a
place of confrontation, where artists
and audience meet live.” On stage,
he is concerned abou “tension

Elvis Presley

between classical and contempor- I

ary theater.”

Shaktman said the season
opener, “Fathers Day,” is a very
contemporary play. The comedy.
written by Oliver Hailey, focuses on
the lives of three divorcees, their
husbands and children. Judging
from past productions, students
prefer contemporary theater while-
older people enjoy classical produc-
tions.

Other plays scheduled for this

year include “You Never Can Tell, ’ ’
"by George Bernard Shaw; “Once
Upon a Time,” a Russian play
making its American debut; “Slow
Dance On the Killing Ground” and
“Medal of Honor Rag.”

The latter two plays featufes‘
actor Joe Morton, who starred in
‘ ‘Sizwe Bansi Is Dead” at the Public
Theater last year. Morton won a
Tony award as best actor in the
Broadway musical “Raisin. ’ ’

The Public is a professional
resident theater company. “We
do this as our jobs--our lives,”
Hurst said. Casting for the equity

company is done almost entirely in
New York City.

One of the Public Theater’s goals,
according to Shaktman, is to make
the theater active for most of the
year. ‘ ‘We would like to offer actors
eight to nine months work-,” he
said. “Music, art, and business
students should consider an intern-
ship at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater.”

The theater’s Allegheny Center
location is given to them as a

rent-free grant from the city of 

Pittsburgh. Corporations, founda-
tions and individual" donations
supply half of the theater operating
budget.

“If we depended only on tickets
(sales) the price of the tickets would
be twice as much (58 to $16)” Hurst
said. “People who buy tickets and
contribute are given quality
theater.” Students can purchase

tickets for $2.50.
“The Public Theatre was formed

to fill a gap. Pittsburgh "had no

resident professional company for
10 years.

The city has extended the amount

He Lives On In Memory

Moody Blue
Elvis Presley
RCA

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

It’s a shame that “Moody Blue”
was Elvis Presley’s ﬁnal album.
“Moody Blue” is not a bad album;
it’s just not Presley. But since his
initial heyday in the 50’s, Presley
hasn’t been Presley either.

What’s wrong with “Moody
Blue” is that it’s a reworking of
other people’s hits and near-hits.
There’s_ only one genuine 50’s tune
(“Little Darlin’,” which could’ve
come off the Fonz’ favorite juke
box), which is really what Presley
does best, and too many over-
produced country-western songs.

“Moody Blue” is half live and
half taped at Presley’s private
studio at Graceland. The‘ live half
generates his electricity. Even an
excessV__of___b_a_cl5g_round ygggs in

most of the numbers can’t ruin
them and fans shriek at every note
from Presley’s throat. One number
he , does rather well is Olivia
New-John’s “Let Me Be There.”

Unfortunately, the good mo-
ments are all too brief. Presley’s
voice is still in top form, rich and
mellow. But with these song
selections, it adds up to boredom.

In over 20 years in the limelight,
Presley changed from a primitive
Mick Jagger sexuality to a
successful Sinatraﬁed stance. It’s
sad to think of the energy and
talent that phased into something
almost commonplace. It makes one
wonder if Jagger and the rest of the
60’s rock stars are headed for the
same slide to boredom.

This doesn’t mean Presley was

lacking in talent—he could still

pack concert halls, he could still
belt it out—-but something was
missing that can not be blamed on
weight gain or poor choice of
material, but on the simple passage
of time.

 

 .1:

 

John Sebastian will perform with Steve Martin Sept. 18 at Heinz Hail.

 
 

When Presley died, he was not
the same Presley idealized by S0’s
beach movies and looked up to by
throngs of rabid teenagers.

Presley’s cult, however, never
died. Fed by records, memories,
late-night movies and the glorifica-
tion of the 50’s, it grew and
produced the thousands who stood
outside Graceland’s gates in hopes
of seeing his bodv. the showing of
his movies in local theaters when a
rew months ago they were screened
on television, and the phenomenal
sale of his records—factories are
working 24-hour shifts and seven
day weeks to meet the demand.

The king is dead, but his memory
lives on.

TV’s Prime Time Soap Opera

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Soap operas came to primevtime
with the advent of “Soap”—ABC’s
highly—touted adult comedy ser-
ies. The show’s claims to originality
are unfounded; this is actually a
reworked “Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman’ ’ translated to prime time.

But ‘ ‘ Soap’ ’ works. It’s the tale of
two sisters, Jessica Tate (Katherine
Helmond) and Mary Campbell
(Cathryn Damon) who live on
“opposite sides of the tracks” in
Dunn’s River, Connecticut. But
that’s where all resemblence to
normal soaps ceases.

Jessica is having an affair with
her tennis instructor, who’s fooling
around on the side with her
nymphomaniac niece. Jessica's
husband Chester (Robert Mandan,

additional growth and improvement
is always a challenge.
performing arts in recent years, the
end result has not always been a
happy one.

Ben Shaktman, general director of the Pittsburgh Public Theater, believes it is
important for students to be active in theater. The non-profit organization is
opening its third season ‘near the end of this month.

_ After The Show
Bruce Foster
Millennium
By JIM FARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer‘

Without the Beatles, peace
marches or the easy optimism of the
60’s, poor Bruce Foster just isn’t at
home. Foster’s “After The Show”
release is a portrait of a 6Q’s child
who is caught in the trap of the 70’s
and feeling its bite.

Ten of the 11 songs deal with
something that is lost and sorely
missed: love, luck, freedom,
identity—even life. There is also a
sense of better, earlier times and a
greater sense that those times are
lost forever.

“Search For Tomorrow”) is natur-
ally oblivious to it all.

Her son Jodie (Billy Crystal) is
gay and wants a sex change
operation. For sister Mary, there is
the problem of her husband’s
(Richard Mulligan) impotence.

In upcoming episodes, the show
will feature racial, religious and
sexual problems.

The main problem with ‘ ‘Soap’ ’ is
that it tries too hard. Too much is
shoved in too soon. It tries too hard
for laughs and so doesn’t achieve
the ones it deserves. In shows of
this sort, directors tend to add more
and more characters so more zany
antics can be presented.

All this does is clutter the scene
and divert attention from the
characters who really do matter.
That's what eventually ruined

Foster’s Music Dated
To ‘Beatles’ Days 

Unfortunately, Foster is out of
touch not only with better days but
with songwriting ability. This
album is a classic example of
adequate musicianship wasted on
poor material.

Most of the numbers are light to
middle rock touched by fold and
ballad motifs. Most also are
drooping cliches, often overdosing
on lethal portions of repetition and
rhythm. “After The Show” fails,
not due to a soured experiment, but
because of a conservative fear of
trying something new. Boredom is
the killer.

Faint glimmers oflife include  ’
o  

title track, a slow, smooth mel
(Continued on Page 11)

“Mary Hartman” and “Soap”
could easily go down the drain.

As for the acting, it’s‘ ﬁne.
Helmond and Damon are properly
depraved as the sisters who ne ,
could quite conquer their sibling
rivalry. Mandan, doing an updated
Robert Young routine, is also
impressive.

There are a few sour notes.
Mulligan has no depth and his
comedy sense (if he even has one) is
lousy on timing. He seems to spend
the entire show looking startled.
Crystal minces about in a manner
that should offend everyone for its
staginess, not to mention gays for
the obvious insult. Besides, Jodie is
supposedly a transsexual, which is
another matter entirely.

“Soap” is far from a washout, but
there’s got to be more substance
along with the shock tactics if it is to
work.

For 

F oster’s Music Dated

WTO ‘Beatles’ Days

(Continued from Page 10,’
that eases into climax, and “Shot

Down In Denver,” a lively ballad A

that Foster’s gritty-on-the-high-
note vocal serves well.

The only other piece of interest on
the LP is “Man With A Dragon, ” an
orientalized ballad that (minus the
dead, didactic refrain) is as terse as
a Confucius apothegm.

The other eight tracks are all
‘in tunes that we’ve either heard
ﬁre or never wanted to hear in
the first place. Against Don
McLean's “American Pie,” Fos-
ter’s “Platinum Heroes” is a ﬂat

and expendable tribute to the
Beatles.

The other songs are lifeless,
nondescript entities which, like
bland foods, need plenty of
seasoning.

Foster does have some inter-
esting ideas in his lyrics, like his
feelings of rejection and attraction
to his past. But without good music,
forget the lyrics.

Before the next effort, Foster
should find a good songwriting
guitarist and team up with him. As
for “After The Show”—to the
bargain bin.

There's no excuse for shying away from Red Rodgers’ new dance, “Visions of a

new Blackness,” because you think modern dance is too any and obscure.

Rodgers, a Detroit native with a New York based dance company, worked hard

to keep everything explicit and clear.

THE POINT of “Visions”; moments in black American history and how blacks

maintained strength and resilience in spite of discrimination. ,

The dance vignettes, which are played against a background of Delta blues,
ragtime, contemporary jazz and classical music, tell of days in slavery, the black
migration to the North and the civil rights movement.

One of the most amusing pieces illustrates the move from the Southern plan-
tations to the Northern cities. Some of the source material is straight from history
and sociology books, but the best of it comes from Rodgers’ grandmother.

 Pitt vs. “Fine Academic lnstitution” 

 

Notre Dame and William and M31’ Y- 111 b01d type. yards in 1976, and Fimian managed 700. The
Panther scouting report states the Indians will pass
“only when forced to.” That may be the first time
the Indians handle the ball.

The Panther defense, led by the front line of Dave
Di_Ciccio, Bob Gruber, Dave Logan, Randy .
Holloway and Hugh Green, may be one of the best
in the country.

Pitt’s performance last week was so impressive,
people thought they were watching the Pittsburgh
Steelers defense. The man most responsible is Jimmy
Johnson, Sherrill’s defensive coordinator, whose
past successes in the field of college football are quite‘
impressive. 

A crowd in excess of 37,000 is expected for the W
and M game and in an effort to boost sales, children
under the age of 16 will be admitted for $2 when
accompanied by an adult.

The Great Quarterback Mystery will remain just
that until kickoff time (1:30 P.M.), when senior Tom
Yewcic or freshman Rick Trocano will step in.
Trocano is the most qualified option runner the
Panthers have, though Yewcic’s experience last year
might earn him the starting position. In any case, it
makes one wonder what’s going to be Wayne
Adams’ role in all of this. After all, he used to be
number-two behind Matt Cavanaugh and does
possess a strong arm.

Mel Blount Ends I-Ioldout

PITTSBURGH (AP)—All-Pro
comerback Mel Blount ended his
8-week holdout, withdrew a $5
million suit against his coach and
rejoined the Pittsburgh Steelers
with a smile last night.

“I feel great. I'm real happy,”
said Blount, an off-season quarter
horse rancher who showed up at the
Steeler ofﬁces attired in a denim
suit and a cowboy hat.

Just what made Blount happy
was uncertain. Neither he nor
Steeler President Dan Rooney
would reveal how they settled their
contract differences.

Prior to this season Blount had
three years and an option year left
on his contract.

“We was able to come to some
agreement. I’m happy with my
contract now, and I’m ready to
play,” said the smiling Blount.

He wasn’t smiling last July when
he began his holdout and also
lodged his $5 million slander suit
against Coach Chuck Noll, pledging

Boaters Gain First Win;

he would “never” again play for
him because of remarks Noll made
sitting Blount into a “criminal
element” of excessively rough pro
football players.

“We never was enemies,”
Blount said after his return.

“Anytime you’re in a war, you
have a tendency to say things.
Some things, they’re meant, some
things, they’re not. .

“‘...I’ve always said I felt Chuck
was a ﬁne coach and a ﬁne
gentleman.”

It was established at a press
conference that Blount had been
ﬁned for his tardiness. The amount
was not disclosed. It was also
uncertain just when Blount would
be back in uniform with Pittsburgh,
and he had not met personally with
Noll, who will make the ﬁnal roster
decision.

“I feel I’m in good shape,” said
Blount. “I’m quite sure whatever
decision they make will be best for
the team and myself.”

The Pitt soccer team's offense
came to life Wednesday afternoon
as the booters completely domina-
ted the rough St. Vincent Bearcats,
8-0.

The Panthers, hampered by the
sluggish offense that scored only 10
goals in 14 games last year, started
off quickly with a talley by junior
midﬁelder Craig Connelly. Bob
Hughes and Karl Nigh rounded out
the first-stanza scoring as the half
ended, 3-0.

J edd Zaring opened the second-
half scoring, followed by Tim

helping all-America candidate
Frank Bucci to his ﬁrst shutout of
the season. This puts Bucci well on
his way to being the Panthers’
all-time goalkeeper. Pitt controlled
the game with crisp, short passes
and never seemed to let the
Bearcats’ rough style bother them..

With the contest well under
control, coach Leo Bemis took out
his starters and used the remaining

“We ﬁnally put it all together,”
sophomore striker Rich Roccon

Blount was the second All-Pro
holdout to rejoin the Steelers.

Middle linebacker Jack Lambert’

rejoined the team two weeks ago
after signing a reported ﬁve-year,
$1.25 million contract.

The Steelers contract differences
with Blount were thrust into the
background in mid-July when the
6-foot-3, 225 pounder filed the
slander suit against Noll.

Under cross-examination at the
Atkinson ‘trial, Noll said some
Steelers, including Blount, had also
been excessively rough on occasion.

‘ ‘There’s no chance at all that I’ll
play for the Steelers under Noll,”
Blount said at the time the suit was
ﬁled.

‘ ‘How in the heck can you play for
a coach who says you’re part of a
criminal element that goes around
maiming people?” asked Blount’s
agent Reg Foster.

The suit was ﬁled in New

Orleans. Blount, aformer player at ‘

Southern University, lives in Slidell.

Cavanaugh Awaiting

Return to Panther
Starting Lineup

by KAREN KADILAK

Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh
walked into the TV room outside the
home locker room at Pitt Stadium
yesterday to choruses of “How ya
doin’, Matt?” and “Good to see you
back, ‘ ’ or ‘ ‘We,re behind you all the
way, Matt.” It was the ﬁrst time‘
Cavanaugh had seen most of his
teammates since after the 19-9 loss
to Notre Dame Saturday.

yesterday, the dejection was

Cavanaugh said. “It’s going to be

A  I-‘C Harriers Open

Fall Campaign

By BOB LABRIOLA

‘Optimism runs high as the 1977
Pitt cross country team undergoes
ﬁnal preparations for its Sept. 24
inaugural meet, the Malone Invita-
tional.

Initially, the Panthers had
planned to participate in an
exhibition meet and the California

ﬁpte Invitational in early Septem-
‘her. but nagging injuries like junior
Bob Lee’s leg bruise and freshman
Randy Bailey’s bout with mononu-
cleosis forced head coach Mike
Agostinella to move back his
training schedule.

Pitt will compete in the Central
Collegiate Conference, where A-
gostinella looks to improve on last
year’s seventh place finish.
Among the 25 teams in the
conference are Penn State, Michi-
gan, Notre Dame, Bowling Green
and schools located as far west as
the Air Force Academy.

“Looking at last year’s results
and graduation losses, I think that

Shigan, Penn State and Bowling
’een will all be tough,” Agosti-
nella said, “but I feel we have one
of the top three teams in the
conference."

This year, the Panters will
participate in two new meets, the
Marshall Invitational and the
USTFF meet at Penn State. The
Marshall Invitational will give Pitt
a chance to compete against many
powers from the South, while the
USTFF meet will be held eight days
before the NCAA Championships
at Washington State.

 
    

Pitt seeks to better last year’s ~

showing at the National Champion-
ships; Mel Boyd was the only
Panther to qualify for the meet.
Explain_ing the qualifying process,
Agostinella said, “The Central
Collegiate Championship meet is
not yet a qualifier for the NCAA, so
we have to submit our results and
times by mail to a three-member
board, which will decide who
qualiﬁes for the meet in Washing-
ton.”

Panther hopes are resting on the
shoulders of veterans Dave
McDonald, Tim Hermann and
Boyd.

Mel Boyd is truly a runner of
national caliber,” Agostinella said.

“I would rate him in the top 20 or
30 in the country.”

With the loss of only one runner

due to graduation and the addition

of a freshman crop termed by

Agostinella as “the best overall
since I came here,” the cross
country team could be ready to take
a place in the national spotlight.

Pirates, Cards Split Doubleheader

ST. LOUIS (AP)—Hector Cruz
slammed a three-run homer and
Roger Freed added a two-run triple
in a seven-run sixth inning that
carried the St. Louis Cardinals to a
10-7 triumph over the Pittsburgh
Pirates and a split of their twi-night
doubleheader last night.

St. Louis’ comeback wiped out a
6-1 Pittsburgh lead and further
damaged the Pirates’ hopes of
overtaking the pacesetting Phila-
delphia Phillies in the National
League East after John Candelaria,
17-5, pitched Pittsburgh to a 4-3
victory in the opener.

Freed, a seldom-used first
baseman, collected four hits in the
nightcap and triggered the sixth-
inning surge with a lead-off single.

Ken Reitz followed with a single
and Cruz kayoed starter Grant
Jackson with his sixth homer, a shot
to left field. Larry Demery, 6-5,
relieved Jackson and gave up
singles to Mike Tyson, Lou Brock
and Garry Templeton preceding
-Freed’s triple, which capped the
rally.

Pittsburgh’s early cushion was
built on four RBI by Phil Garner,
who slammed his 17th homer in the
third inning and delievered a
two-run double in the fourth inning.

In the opener, Pittsburgh snap-
ped a 1-1 tie on four straight hits,
starting with Ed 0tt’s double and
ending with Candelaria’s two-base
hit in the seventh inning to establish
a 4-1 lead.

Candelaria departed in the ninth
after hitting Ken Reitz with a pitch
and surrenduring a two-out single
to Mumphrey.

Cards pinch-hitter Dane Iorg beat
out an inﬁeld single against reliever
Rich Gossage and Lou Brock drilled
a two-run single before Dave Rader
fouled out to end the game.

Brock singled home two runs in
the seventh inning of the nightcap
for the Cards and Frank Taveras

doubled home Pittsburgh’s ﬁnal

run in the eighth.

Johnny Sutton, 2-1, the third of
four Cardinal pitchers, was the
winner with Rawly Eatwick picking
up his 10th save. By losing,
Pittsburgh reduced Philadelphia’s
‘fmagic number” for clinching the
Eastern Division title to eight.

In the opener, Pittsburgh scored
in the fourth‘ on 0tt’s sacriﬁce ﬂy
and St. Louis tallied in the sixth on
Ted Simmons’ single. Eric
Rasmussen, 10-16, absorbed his
ﬁfth straight defeat.

Matt Cavanaugh
Awaits Return

(Continued from Page 12)
Cavanaugh has ruled out the
possibility of a medical redshirt,
which mean there will be no chance
of Cavanaugh sitting out the
remainder of this year and coming
back anew next season.

“We’re going to win a lot of
games and I'm going to be helping
them win them,” Cavanaugh said.
“A redshirt is out as far as I'm
concerned. I want to play this
season and help this team. All I
want to do is concentrate and come
back and do my job. This team is
going places and I want to go to
those places with them.

“I have conﬁcence in this team, ”
Cavanaugh continued. “It’s not
going to fold because of one bad
circumstance.

“I know I’m going to do my part
to put some enthusiasm in this‘
team. They’re in a different
siutation. The receivers are going to
have to make adjustments to a
different quarterback.‘ They’re
doing to have to keep trying. Ifthey
do, I know they’ll be 4-1, 3-1 or
whatever it will be when I come
back. We're going to be back.”

Matt Cavanaugh will be back,
too. Until then, it -§2von’t be his
strong arm or mere presence on the
ﬁeld that will lead the way for the
Panthers. It will be his spirit, the
kind of spirit that rallies a team
together. There are sure to be a lot
more choruses of “We’re behind
you, Matt” heard around Pitt
Stadium before the season’s over.

Panther Dave DiCiccio;
  The End to a Means

By KAREN KADILAK

Like E.F. Hutton, Pitt defensive
line coach Jimmy Johnson com-
mands attention.

When Johnson speaks, people,
namely the defensive ends and

tackles on this year’s Panther’

football ,team, listen. What
Johnson has to say isn’t idle
chatter.‘ It usually has substance
behind it-——the kind of meat-and-
potatoes talk that made all-Ameri-
cas out of people like present-day
pros (and former Johnson charges)
Lucious and Dewey" Selmon and

“Sugar Ray” Hamilton.

So when Johnson says Pitt’s
starting defensive right end, Dave
DiCiccio, is “one of the best, if not
the 'best” defensive ends in the
country, critics stand up and take
notice. Opponents begin to worry
and tremble and gear their plays to
the opposite side of the line, just
like Notre Dame did last Saturday
against DiCiccio.

The Fighting Irish will tell you
Johnson isn’t talking off the top of
his head when he says such nice
things about DiCiccio, a converted
monster back from Midland, Pa.

The junior defensive end, as
Johnson implies and as Notre
Dame found out Saturday in its
19-9 win over the Panthers, is for
real.

He, was real enough to make
about half a dozen tackles. He was

real enough to intercept a Notre
Dame pass and deflect another
enemy aerial, an action resulting in
another ‘ Pitt interception.

He even scored a safety.

DiCiccio’s authenticity on the
right side of the Panthers’
defensive front was accentuated by

the fact that he played most of the

.game with a slight separation of the
right shoulder, an injury that has
kept him out of much of the contact
workuiat practice this past week.

There never was any doubt in
DiCiccio’s mind that he could
handle his first full-time starting
duties on the right defensive ﬂank.
DiCiccio believed what Johnson
said about him before the season
began.

“I feel that as long as I’m
playing defensive end, Pitt will
never have to worry about my
position,” DiCiccio said. “I don’t
want to sound like I’m bragging or
anything, but I have confidence in
my own abilities and feel I can get
the job done. There shouldn’t be
any worry about my ability to play
the position. I’ll do the best I can,
and if I do it that way, I know I’ll be
doing it best.”

Dave DiCiccio, shoulder injury
and all, hopes to do the same
against William and Mary tomor-
row afternoon at Pitt Stadium. He
doesn’t want to make a liar out of
himself or Jimmy Johnson.

Pan therettes Optimistic *

By MARY S. HUZINEC

If Pitt’s women's cross country
team is looking forward to this
Saturday’s season opening meet,
the California State College Invita-
tional, with the optimism of
sophomore runner Becky F alck, the
team should come home a winner.

F alck, the defending Invitational
champion, covered the three-mile
course in 18:45 last year. She feels
the team has a positive attitude
toward the meet and the coming
season. »

“We’re working together,”
Falck said. “It’s a team effort.”

Coach Freda Goff agrees.

“I’m very pleased with the
attitude of the team,” Goff said.
“The girls reported to the ﬁrst

practice of the season, on Sept. 2, in
great shape.”

This Saturday, the eight-woman
squad will face some stiff compe-
tition from Slippery Rock State
College, Bucknell and ﬁve other
teams.

Goff and Falck both feel the team
has a good chance to be one of the
top teams at the Invitational

because of the addition of two

strong freshmen runners, Theresa
Walton and Diane Wiegel.

‘ ‘Theresa and Diane have helped
the morale of the team immensely, ’ ’
Goff added.

Returning from last season are
senior Jenny Westman and sopho-
mores Brenda Chorpenning, Maria
Sciullo, Kathy Paczkowski and Sue

‘Miller. Falck, Chorpenning, A

newsbriefs

Walton and Wiegel received partial
scholarships this year.

“These girls deserve a lot of
credit for the dedication they’ve
shown,” Goff said. “If they
continue to keep the attitude they
have presently, we should soon be
able to compete with the top teams
like Penn State, the University of
Massachusetts and Rutgers. Our
goal is to keep up with them and
eventuallv beat them.”
