Mon. Injunction Limits Pickets

BY BILL HADUCK
A preliminary injunction has
been ordered by Common Pleas
Judge Warren Watson in the 8 day
old Pitt janitors‘ strike. The
injunction, which forbids the

_ striking workers to interfere with
people .trying to enter campus

buildings‘ and limits to two, the
number of pickets allowed at any
one entrance, came Monday after a
hearing with the Judge.

The effects of the ruling seem to
vary with interpretation. Dick
Fennell, Union steward said, “We
can have more than two people, the
ruling just means signs," while
Tom Sherry from the office of
employee relations said, “We have
argued that it means two people.
But, it’s been a pretty peaceful
day, so we didn’t pressit.”

Pitt is looking for a continuation
of the injunction, according to
Sherry, who added “Legality is on
our side."

The strike began last Tuesday
night when 400 members of Local
29, Service'Employees Inter-
national. walked off their jobs and

set up picket lines around the
University buildings.

The janitors primarily demanded
a better wage contract to replace
the one which expired last
December 31. The University
offered a 65 cent increase over the
next three years. The janitors
wanted an 80 cent increase. The
University then withdrew their
offer.

Fringe beneﬁts and vacation
time also were issues. The strike
continued as picket lines kept food
delivery and garbage trucks from
their duties. Hot water in the
dorms began to_ dwindle and an
injunction sent the operating en-_
gineers back to their jobs.

On Friday, Common Pleas Judge
Warren Watson and an entourage
of lawyers made a tour of the
campus in an’ attempt by the
University to have an injunction
handed down, ordering the janitors
back to their jobs. Watson decided
there wasn't enough hazard caused

Dept. Proposed to Unify

Life Sciences Programs

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Students involved in life-science
oriented programs in different
departments throughout the Uni-
versity may eventually function
one consolidated life
sciences department.

According to Jerome Rosenburg.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and

Sciences. the search is already in .

progress for a chairman to head the
new‘ department. Discussion of a
merger stems from the administra-
tive and educational overlapping in
the-present system.

One of the goals is the
development of a well-rounded
biology-core program for under-
graduates through sharing of
teaching staff from each of the
presently independent depart-
ments.

“The reason for the change.‘
Rosenburg said. “is the dissatis-
faction in the biology department.
It's been a big burden for them.‘

Since the -60s‘ outgrowth of
specialized departments in mole-
cular. physical and non-clinical
biology. there has been_ a new

movement to reintegrate the
specializations under a single
administrative unit. _

Rosenburg said “The goal is not
to save money, but to have people
work together with a greater
ﬂexibility as new programs emerge
in the field.”

Ronald Bentley. chairman of
biochemistry. one of the depart-
ments which would be affected, felt
administrative difficulties of such a
merger aside, there were definite
advantages to a single department.

“This is seen as a step that will
lead to a strengthened‘ biology
department, _ and very advanta-
geous to students interested in
biological fields."

“lt’s cleaner to have a smaller
number of departments,” com-
mented Max Louffer, chairman of
biophysics and microbiology,
another involved biology depart-
ment. “Any administrative change
has a lot of little consquences,
however.”

Rosenburg, in his report to the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Committee. Monday. said the
eventual reorganization had overall
support from a consensus of
effected departments.

“It is generally understood that
this is the plan for the future. It
will not be without its pains."
Rosenburg said.

Also considered at the meeting‘
was the fusion of the physics and

astronomy departments.
. \ .

to warrant an immediate injunc-

tion.

Throughout the strike,» meetings
with the State Mediation Board
failed to produce any settlement.

The report of a new offer by the
University brought Union members
to Webster Hall Hotel Sunday for a
vote. David Glavin.
president said, however, there was
no new offer to report. According
to Joseph Dutton, Vice Chancellor
of Operations for the University,
Pitt had made an offer but the
negotiating team didn't take it to
the Union.

Meanwhile, cafeteria workers.
who had honored the picket lines.
went back to their jobs, but food
remained a problem as pickets
refused to let trucks make their
deliveries.

Monday, Judge Watson issued
the preliminary injunction. limiting
picket numbers and power.

Food and mail services were
expected to get back to normal now
that deliveries are again being
made. “With the injunction, you
can’t do much about it." said
Fennel, who explained drivers are
being told about the strike and
several have decided to honor it by
not crossing the picket lines.

Trees Hall and Fitzgerald Field
House remained closed to intra-
mural sports and recreation. Leo
Bemis, coordinator of recreational
facilities at Trees, said “This
building would not stand more than
keeping our classes scheduled."

Kissinger Talks of Nixon

Resignation,

NBC News said Tuesday it had
learned that Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger told two Israeli
cabinet members he believes
President Nixon will leave office
within six months.

Throught an aid, Kissinger called
the report an “outrageous lie.”

The two Israeli officials had taken
part with Kissinger in disengage-
ment talks. He reportedly told
them President Nixon would be
leaving office soon, but that his
position as secretary of state in an
administration headed by Vice-
President Gerald Ford would not
change. '

Richard Valeriani. the NBC
reporter who received.the state-
ment from Kissinger’s aid. told the

ilmpeochmenl Pressure Drops, Moorheod Says

BY RICHARD SWARTZ AND
SCOTT MACLEOD

The United States House of
Representatives. awaiting word
from the Rodino Judiciary Com-
mittee on whether or not to bring
impeachment proceedings against
President Nixon, went back into
session Monday after a month's

recess. _
In his Pittsburgh office last week.

the Pitt News interviewed Con-
gressman William Moorhead. 14th
District. about his feelings on
impeachment. Following are
exerpts from that interview.
QUESTION: Congressman, you
have been home for almost a month
talking to your constituents. What
reactions are you getting on the
issues of impeachment and the
energy crisis?
MOORHEAD: Strangely enough
they are somewhat interrelated.
We found right after the firing of
Archibald Cox. the so-called
"Saturday Night Massacre." (re-
action was) very intense. Mail.
telephone calls, and telegrams
poured in and then it kind of
tapered off. l'm not saying people
were changing their minds. but it
just tapered off.

Then when the energy crisis

V began to hit home, the calls on

impeachment began to increase
again. with the people somehow
interrelating the two.

I think it is the feeling that they
don't know whether we are facing

an energy crisis. or whether this is
a hoax perpetrated by the oil
industry to get bigger proﬁts and

aided and abetted by the Nixon‘

administration which obviously has
political debts to the oil companies.
But the people are saying to
themselves. ‘We have in ofﬁce a
man we do not trust and this makes
us uncomfortable. particularly
when something like the energy
crisis comes up.‘
QUESTION: Do they feel he does
not have the capabilities to handle
the problems?
MOORHEAD: I think it is more
they no longer trust him. In other
words, he says there is a fuel

shortage; Ralph Nader says we are

drowning in oil. In another
presidency. more people would be
likely to believe the President than
Ralph Nader.

QUESTION: You said that right
after the Cox firing, the demand for
impeachment was very great. How
does last week compare with the
week following the Saturday Night
Massacre?

MOORHEAD: Oh. not nearly as
intense. There were something
like 3000 letters and phone calls
after the Cox tiring and it would be
only one-tenth that amount now.
QUESTION: What kinds of things
have you been doing to get
feedback from your constituency?
MOORHEAD: I get a lot of my
information from talking to high
school groups. not so much college
students. because high school

‘then opened

students tend to reﬂect more their
parents’ opinion.

I was at Wilkinsburg High School
and spoke about ﬁve minutes and
the floor up for
questions. They came hot and
heavy.

(With Wilkinsburg) you have an
area that is a fair cross section. Of
course. I have spoken at a number
of other high schools too. I get a
fairly clear impression--the im-
pression that you end up with is a
basic mistrust. distrust. of particu-
larly Mr. Nixon. but the diseases is
contagious enough that there is
even a distrust of goevernment
generally.

QUESTION: How about your own
distrust. Your Government Infor-
mation subcommittee recently un-
covered misconduct in the IRS.
How broad is this misconduct?
MOORHEAD: I have no proof. but
I feel that for every one case we
unearth. there are 100 that we
haven’t. I think it's the mentality
that could justify breaking and
entering a psychiatrist's office to
get the goods on a patient.
QUESTION: People have been
coming into your office to talk with
you about impeaching President
Nixon. What have they been
telling you?

MOORHEAD: I had two groups in
last week. One was the American
Civil Liberties Union that pre-
sented me with a petition signed by
3800 people insisting on im-
peachment. They were followed by

a group calling themselves the
Committee to Unelect the Pres-
ident. They said they had 16,000
signatures.

QUESTION: What effect does this
have on you as a Congressman?
MOORHEAD: I don't think
impeachment is a question where
you take a poll of your consti-
tuency. If the majority said he
should be impeached and I say the
evidence isn't there that says he

should be impeached.- I think I
should vote against it.

I think there is a factor in voting
for impeachment even if I do
conclude that he has committed
impeachable offenses. If I think a
vote for impeachment will tear the
country apart. then maybe I should
submerge my feelings and consider
what is best for the country.

 Trutlr Abqut Waterbeds 

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement
over the old fashioned boxspring/mattress. Doctors have rec-
ognized the therapeutic and hygienic values of the waterbed
for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed your back,
shoulders and hips receive total floatation support. Body
weight is distributed more evenly than is possible on any con-
ventional bed, making a waterbed the most comfortable and

. healthful sleeping surface available. A waterbed’s gentle heat
helps relax tense muscles while the firm floating support lulls
you into a deep, restful sleep.

Stop into our showroom and experience the total comfort of a

Dear Editor:

Wc’want to bring to the attention
of the Pitt student body an issue
which concerns the upcoming
-elections for student government
positions.

Last fall. after submitting a
constitutional charter, members of
the Ad Hoc Committee on Chile
appeared before the Student
Government Board (SGB) to be
recognized as a student organiza-
tion. The committee had two
stated purposes: 1) to make known
to the university and local
communities the facts of the coup
which deposed the government of
President Allend; 2) to aid, in any
way possible, the victims of the

ensuing military repression. The
SGB summarily denied our
petition. They argued, variously,

that we were a “special interest”
group, that we represented a
“short term” issue, that we
“duplicated” the activities of
existing organizations, and that
they didn’t have any allocation
money left (although we weren’t
asking for money, only recogni-
tion). What are the facts?

i) What principle entitled the
SGB to differentiate the “special
interest" of a group of students.
working to organize educational
forums on the Chilean coup and
trying to aid its victims from the
“interests" represented by various

. al®tl],g We [Darla @utlsitile

because you won't bet a straight
answer anyway. Besides. this is
my last term--l deserve to make at
least one dumb move).

But the particular morning in
question was not just very dark--it
was also very snowy. very slushy.
and generally very ugly. ’

Autos and buses sat stalled in
traffic, burning gasoline to do little
more than turn generators to

fraternity based organizations or.
for example. the Folk Dance group
which the SGB in the past has
recognized and supported ﬁnan-
cially. The Chile Committee
addresses itself to the whole
university community with an issue
that is vital to the nature of
academic endeavor; the repression._
in Chile. of civil and intellectural
liberties. a repression condoned (if
not sponsored by) our government.

2) We too hope the Chile tragedy
will turn out to be a “short term"
issue: that is. that Chilean
democracy be speedily restored.
that unions. universities. political
parties and media be allowed again
to function freely. that the many
thousands of prisoners. tortured
and detained in concentration
camps by the junta. be released.
etc. The SGB apparently claims
some power of political prophecy
which we do not possess. No
doubt. SGB. whose social con-
science scems to extend no further
that the evening digest. meant also
to suggest that interest in Chile
would soon die out.

Since its formation in September.
the Committee has reached a total
audience of well over 1000 people
through the ﬁlm programs. teach-
ins and lectures it has organized at
the Oakland campus. Carnegie-
Mellon and Pitt-Johnstown.
Participation by Committee mem-
bers in radio talk shows, TV
“spots.' newspaper articles and
the publication of our own Chile
Newsletter have made an impact on
the Pittsburgh community at large.

At the moment. we have
outstanding invitations to speak on
at least two local radio shows and to
bring our teach’-in to Duquesne and
Allegheny Community College.
Next Tuesday. January 22. we are
co-sponsoring with the University
Center for international Studies
and the History Department. a
lecture on Chile by a visiting Latin
American specialist (8 pm. 324 CL).

We wonder. in passing. how the
SGB would have greeted a student
interested in protesting U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. in say.
l965??‘???

3) in what sense does the Ad Hoc
Committee on Chile “duplicate"
existing organizations? Who else
is undertaking the range of
activities we have sponsored?
Politically and personally we come
from very different persuasions;

v

 

_ered only
constitution submitted by the?

itor

what unites us in our dismay over
the military terror and our honest
desire to do what we can to bring
the Chile issue to the attention of
our community. The SGB was
aware that our constitution indi-
cates this as the only criterion for
membership: but they went ahead
to cynically suggest to us that we
merge with the YSA!!!

in raising these questions we are
concerned with not only our rights
but those of other student
organizations which have been
similarly victimized by the SGB (for
example. the Third World People-‘s

Coalition. the New American
Movement. the Anthropology
Club. Hare Krishna. and the
YWCA.

Not incidentally, three of the
above mentioned organizations
including our committee are of a
left-liberal or radical nature. The
SGB seems to feel that in granting
the YSA recognition [although not
financial support] they have don
their bit by “free speech” and the
“left” as they conceive it. What
right do they have to dictate aims,
ideas and organizational ties to us
or to any other student group?
What entitles them to withold
recognition [and hence University
priveliges] from students. who pay
their tuition and fees and have
been working together long and
hard to bring before the University
community an issue they believe is
critical to our moral development?

According to the regulations
governing recognition of student
organizations. the SGB is empow-
to ensure that the

petitioning organization satisfies
University standards. which ours
did. and to determine that the
organization‘ exists in fact is not a
make weight. The right of student
groups to recognition cannot be
usurped by any considerations
other than these.

We call upon our fellow students
to demandan end to the policy of
selective discrimination practiced
by the current SGB. We call upon
the candidates in the coming
elections to make clear their
positions on the duties and
functions of the SGB in relation to
petitions for recognition by student
organizations.

Chancery P

BY ADRIAN MC COY

The Plaza Theatre is a turn of the
century vaudeville house which has
been renovated and is now the
home of the Chancery Lane
Players. Their current production
is George Bernard Shaw's comedy-
philosophy. Don Juan in Hell.

Don Juaniis the third act of
Shaw's longer work. Man and
Superman. Because of its
contents, which were considered
risque in. 1905 when it was first
produced. the third act was always
omitted from American produc-
tions until 1951. The act can be
lifted out of the context of Man and
Superman and performed sep-
arately because it is a dream-
sequence. One of the characters
falls asleep at the end of the second
act; the third act is his dream.

Lorraine Bruno's set is consistent
with this. The black costumes and
pale faces against a black back-
ground suggest the monochromatic
world of the dream and the
after—life.

Shaw’s hell is devoid of the usual
fire-and-brimstone images; it is
merely a black void with four

I ' _ speaker’s podiums in the middle.

 

Pressure Drops,
Moorheacl Says

(Continued frorrz Page 2)

I QUESTION: Why would impeach-

ment tear the country apart?

MOORHEAD: Go back to the
impeachment of Andrew Johnson. I
think that it had a very deleterious
effect -on the country. It was
different (however). The political

motivation was much stronger
then. But the only time we have
attempted impeachment it has

been disastrous to the country.

QUESTION: Is that your oply
reason? ’
MOORHEAD: First I prefer

resignation because then you know
you have a-:co'mplished replacing
the chief executive who has lost the
confidence of the majority of the
people nationwide, and especially
in my district because I know it
better. without a process that tears
the country apart.

QUESTION: What do you say to
those who insist that impeachment
is preferable to resignation because
it would prove to us that the system
can work?

MOORHEAD: Well
prevent the man from resigning. so
it is somewhat hypothetical. If you
start with impeachment
proceedings and he resigns. that
ends them.

Now I've heard this argument
made before and I consider it what
lcall the “purist element." They
would like to go through the
bloodbath just to prove we can go‘
through a bloodbath.

I'm much more pragmatic. - I
would like to see this country back
on the track. so I would personally
welcome resignation.

QUESTION: When Peter Rodino
ﬁnishes his investigation and in the
Committee's opinion, President
Nixon has committed impeachable
offenses, does he have your vote?

MOORHEAD: No. No. I make up
my own mind. I'm not saying I
won't be inﬂuenced by what those
who actually sat and watched the
witnesses say. but nobody has my
vote on this.

An old woman in black enters. She
is a newcomer and refuses to
believe that she is in hell. “I was a
virtuous woman,” she tells Don
Juan. He tells her that is why she
is there. Evidently, the Life-Forces
punishes the “seven deadly vir-
tues” as well. [Shaw never calls
God by name; he is always the
“Life-Force.”]

The woman turns out to be Dona
Ana. a girl Juan had once tried to
seduce. Her father defended his
daughter's outraged honor by
challenging Juan to a duel. The
father is killed, goes to heaven. and
a statue is built on earth in his
memory. The father is so pleased

with this monument that he adopts‘

it as his eternal form. He is bored
in heaven and is in the habit of
dropping in to visit his old friend
Lucifer.

After father and daughter are
reunited, the devil steps up to the
podium, wearing a bright red
caftan and sunglasses. The
discussion beings, ranging from
Nietzsche to the woman's role in
society, and from inan"s ultimate
commitments to the downfall of
romanticism and the realism which

replaced it. No one moves from the
podiums and the script itself bogs
down in places; it is as though the
viewer is trapped at an eternal
David Susskind Show. But this is’
what Shaw wanted. He tried to
create an arena where philosophers
become concrete; a cerebral
theatre. The actors become mere
mouthpieces for differing points of
view. Ifthere is to be any action. it
must take place in the viewer's
mind.

Shaw's heaven and hell are not
based on a good/evil dichotomy.
The only gap between them is “one
of temperament.” Hell is an
eternal repetition of life on earth.
There is plenty of music, art,
company, and worship of beauty
and love; all this, without the
earthly burdens of eating, working,
and sleeping. Not a bad place to
be, except Juan is dissatisfied. He
sees it as a place of unrealized
potentials; it’s “like the first act of
a fashionable play, before things

 

go to heaven, where there is
nothing but the contemplation of
life, where the inhabitants are
trying to raise life onto a higher
level. In hell, men are content to
be men. In heaven, they become
supermen.

The production is faithful to
Shaw's intentions. but somehow it
could have been more dream-like,
more exaggerated. Shaw was a
realistic playwright. but in a
dream-play. the barriers of reason
and logic can be broken down.
Take a corner in hell. with a
metaphysical panel discussion be-
tween an archetype. a 77 year old
woman. a statue and the devil; this
is bizarre and comic. Yet the
bizarre nature of the script is never
played to its potential. Gestures.
facial expressions.and behavior
could have been more violent and
funnier.

cool and cynical; the perfect

THE PI

BY LYNN SCHEIDHAUER

I laugh and marvel at how easy it
is to talk to Robert and Tim Jordan
(lead and rhythm guitar). Only half
a hour ago l stood in front of the
Cathedral and watched as two
blue—jeaned guys approached, one
wearing a hat tipped off to the side.
his long light brown hair swinging.

..the other carrying a brown grocery

bag.

“Excuse me. Could I interview

A you for the Pitt News?”

"Sure. Do you want to come
with us while we eat dinner?"

O.K.

“ls this your first time in
Pittsburgh?"

"Yeah, we just got’ here at 4:00
and went to the hotel. Wc’re
leaving right after the concert."

“Where are you from?”

“Philadelphia,” says Robert
Mast. He’s the ﬂute and tenor sax
player for Forest Green. “In fact,
we used to live down the street
from Daryl Hall & John Oates.
They’re really great." Daryl Hall
8: John Oates is the other group
that played for the beneﬁt concert
in David Lawrence Hall Saturday
night.

"Ray Barrett and I grew up in

to school together since fourth
grade."

“How did you get togetlier‘.’"

“Donald (Hettinger) and I met in
the Air Force." said Robert. “We
played in the band together. Then
we went to the Philadelphia Music
Academy and met Arther. We
dccidedto form a group and called
Tim and Ray." Lon Poland
(drums) and Syd Silverstein (elec-
tric bass) joined later.

"Am I walking too fast?" asked
Robert. "My girlfriend always
complains because l take big steps
and she walks like this." He took
tiny. fast steps like a chicken. I
laugh as I take two steps to one of
his.

“Isn't there any place where. the
food isn't so commercialized'."'

“We could try Pancake Kit-
chen."

Forest Green live together as a
family in a Victorian house in
Wallingford. Pa. “We used to live
in Glenside. but the neighbors
didn't like  laughs Robert.

“The house we live in now is
surrounded by trees. so it's more
secluded." says Tim. “We have
about an acre of ground and'two
entrances."

"The house was a mansion about
fifty years ago." laughs Robert.
“Now the roof leaks right over my
bed."

When Forest Green began three
years ago in Philadelphia. Arther
Cohen (piano) booked the jobs.
"Arther has the talent for talking to
people." Now Bill Rodgers books
local concerts and Steve Miller's
manager books national tours.
“Still we don't make any profit
because we're only well known in
Philadelphia."

“So why go on?”

“Music is so beautiful and
important,” says Tim. “It gives
you the strength to move on.”

“And what do you plan for the
future?”

The Marathon /Vl

BY LYNN CRISANTI

Rotating lights illuminating the
faces of dancers dripping with
sweat...a ballroom alive with the
sounds of continuous music,
referees’ whistles, and shouts of
“keep moving”...frisbees gliding
across the dance floor, snatched
out of the air by the couples to be
used as fans...This was the scene
of Pitt's second annual dance
marathon, held last weekend in the

Student Union Ballroom.
At lO:30 PM on Friday night. 50

 

;

“To reach as many people as we
can and make them happy by
music,” says Tim.

“And eat,” laughs Robert as he
cuts a huge piece of steak.

Forest Green performs all their
own music. “We have four
different song writers so every-

thing is diffrent." says Tim. Tim.-

Ray. Arther. and Syd write the
songs. The other members have
been experimenting with com-
position.

motion. And when the bands ran

But as the following day counted

The members of the remaining
four couples were each awared
ten-dollar certificates from the

performances. a move which was
initiated by Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar. These couples were:
Richard Kruzyuski and Donna
Herman. Kathleen Yourish and

Judy Church. Ted ’Lewis and
Patricia Ford.

in addition to the major prizes
listed above. prizes were also
awarded throughout the course of
the marathon. following the per-
iodic judging. to ten couples.

The 24-hour dance marathon, held
as a fund-raising event for the
American Red Cross. was the ﬁnal
event in a Nostalgia Weekend
program sponsored by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Student Govern-
ment Board. Entering couples
either paid a three-dollar registra-
tion fee or obtained a sponsor who
would agree to pay a certain
amount for each hour the couple
danced. The contestants were
asked to attend a short interpretive
meeting on Friday. January 18.
where they picked up the num-
bered T-shirts which would be
worn throughout their stay on the
dance floor. .

Rest intervals. after every four
hours of non-stop dancing. were
only fifteen minutes long. barely
enough time to -relax and grab a
refreshing drink or light snack
furnished by the Student Govern-
ment Board.

Chancellor Posvar, when asked
what he thought of the marathon,
remarked, ‘‘It’s a wonderful group
spirit activity for charity...and it’s a
fun thing, too.” And just what did
the winners have to say about the
whole ordeal? Clutching her
trophy, Lena Hickman smiled. “I
feel glad this is over--and, never
again.”

"He makes commentaries on life."
Tim explains. "He really helped
Inc become aware of things."

"A couple days ago Lon decided
he wanted to go tobogganning.
The toboggan was as long as from
here to that table over there."
Robert demonstrates. "Syd's
girlfriend broke her leg. Ray tore a
ligament. and now Lon's knee is
hurting." He laughs and adds.
"Just call us the basket band."

“Why did you pick the name
Forest Green?”

“Our music is woodsy,” says
Tim. “lt’s natural...”

“...organic...” adds Robert.

“...and pure.” Tim finishes.

Their- album from Capitol re-
cords has sold ten thousand copies.
mostly in the Philadelphia area
where Forest Green is well known.
“We have to get out on tours so
people can see and hear us. Then
maybe our album will sell more."
The album took about two months
to record. Nothing in it is artificial.
“We wanted to sound like we
live." says Tim.

A broken PA system delays the
concert for over half an hour.
Robert and Donald repair it and
Forest Green walk on stage. Ray on
crutches and Lon limping. From
the audience a girl in a wheelchair

with a cast on her leg smiles at _

them.

With a tipkle of a finger bell,
Forest Green begin their concert,
carrying the audience out of
themselves and into the music.

Soon everyone is clapping their
hands and tapping their feet as
Forest Green mix comedy with
fantastic songs. The audience and
band become one, floating in the
excitement and beauty of Forest
Green’s music, one minute sofe,
and the next loud and hard. The
music “written by inspiration”
reaches the audience by being very
real, very personal.

“This is a song to make you
smile." says Donald (basson. sax.
and ﬂute) before the last encore.
“So we want everyone to come
down from." People crowd below
stage swaying and dancing to the
happy song. And when the song is
over. they want more. Forest
Green is all the name implies:
woodsy. natural. organic. pure.
They leave you happy and craving
for more.

By the time the concert was over,
I was only ready for it to start over.
If you get another chance for either
Hall & Oates, or Forest Green,
don’t miss it.

Saturday's upset of UCLA by

basketball coach Buzz Ridl of Pitt's
encounter with the Fighting Irish
last season. he told the weekly
basketball luncheon.
That game, played in

was won by Notre Dame, 85-76.
The way injwhich that final score
;,'  came about was amazingly similar
5' to the UCLA game.

“We were ahead by 13 at the
half." recalled Ridl. (UCLA was up
by 15) And we had about a nine
point lead with five minutes to go."

Notre Dame was behind Pitt by
seven points with 45 seconds to go.
They trailed the Bruins by that
margin with two minutes. Both

Against UCLA, Dwight Clay
popped a 20-footer from the
baseline to give the Irish a victory.

game. Clay may have been
double-teamed.

Throughout last season. when
the Irish needed a basket. the call
went out to Clay. then a

against Pitt. sinking a 25-foot
jumper to send the game into
overtime. The Irish destroyed the
demoralized Panthers in overtime,
— and thus the large victory margin.
Clay also sunk the winning
"basket in last year’s game at
Marquette. The 5-1! guard never
matches his teammates in total
points, but they always go to him
- when the pressure’s on. A

and 12th on UPI.)

Ridl told everybody that his team
had done quite well against the top
teams. even with last year's 12-14
squad. That team went out to
UCLA and lost by 16 points, one of
the lowest margins of victory in
Pauley Pavillion all season. Los
Angeles writers called it the best
game played by an opponent in
some time.

Even more remarkable is the fact
that Pitt scored the same numbers
of field goals as UCLA, but lost due
to fewer free throw opportunities.

A‘ similar thing happened in the »
1971 Steel Bowl, in which Pitt lost a _

close game to the Bruins.

Irish Tops In 
Basketball Too 

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Notre Dame's basketball team
joined Ara Parseghian's football
team Monday as sovereign of all it
could survey--No. l in The
Associated Press poll.

Dick “Digger" Phelps. young
coach of the Fighting Irish cagers.
anticipated the outcome when.
holding one finger on each hand
high in the air. told a Sunday night
pep rally: .

"I want to thank you fans for
beingthe No. 1 sports fans and N. I
sports town in America."

Notre Dame, in ending UCLA’s
88-game winning streak with a
dramatic come-from-behind 71-70
victory Saturday, bumped the great
California team out of first place for
the first time in three years._

The Irish collected 35 of SI
first-place votes from a panel of
sports writers and broadcasters for
a total of 990 points. UCLA
received I5 first-place votes and
944 points.

UCLA's fall into second place
behind Notre Dame was the most
significant upheaval in the stand-
ings which produced other changes
in the Top 20 although no new
teams moved into the Top Ten.

North Carolina State held to No.
3, followed in order by North
Carolina, Maryland, Marquette,
Vanderbilt, Providence, Alabama
and Long Beach State.

North Carolina jumped ahead of
Maryland. Marquette held No. 6.
Vanderbilt went to No. 7, changing
places with Providence. and

The Pitt women swimmers will
be in action after a long break when
they host Clarion tomorrow night
at Trees Hall.

“The Clarion team is among the
top teams’in the nation and a very
strong power in the East."
commented Coach Virginia
Grindle. “We're looking forward
to meeting the best in the area.“

One of CIarion's strong points
has been diving; Pitt's diving
assistant Barb Schaefer. National
AAU champion. is a former Clarion
diver. Pitt divers Bert Snoznik and
Sharon Schoelkopf will face tough
competition from Barb Siels.
Clarion‘s top diver. but they should

‘teet that challenge.

Team Captain Mamie Heretick is
optimistic towards the meet.
“Clarion may be strong. but we've
been working hard this term and
should give them good. close races.
This type of competition should
bring out the best in our
swimmers."

The meet begins at 7:00 pm and
will probably be held in the

BY YAIER LEHRER

Dick'Bradshaw continued his
rebuilding program for the swim
team this year and turned "up a very
good crop of freshmen. One of
those freshmen has received
nothing but high praise from Al
Coffey. the diving coach. That

:*fl‘CSlll’Il£lll‘S name is Tom Faytol.

Last week at Penn State Faytol
won both diving events to help Pitt
crush the Nittany Lions. To do this
he has had to come a long way.
Although he dove all through high
school. received honorable mention
All-State as a junior and received
All—State honors as a senior.
Coffey is the first diviiigcoach he
has ever had. ‘

"When I was in high school. the
swim coach would read me how to
do the dives out of books." said
Faytol. “then I‘d go and do the
dive and he'd tell me if the dive

looked good."

and has helped me to get rid of
some of the bad habits that I picked
up in high school."

Faytol did not have the advantage
of a real diving coach when he was
in high school and because of that
he learned to do a lot of things the
wrong way. Even so, he won the

WPIAL championship and tin-
ished fiftli in the state diving
competition because of a bad first
round.

With achievements like that,
there can be nothing but great
potential, mistakes and all. "

Evidently, Coffey things so. too.
He has done nothing but praise the
newest addition to the already
formidable diving squad. who last
year went undefeated in dual meet
competition.

"Tom is one of the finest divers I
have ever had the pleasure of
coaching." said Coffey.

Faytol was infested with doubts
about coming to Pitt at first. ‘‘I
wanted to get further away than
twenty miles from home [Forrest
HiIls),” Tom remarked, “and I
especially didn’t think too much of
Oakland but living in the dorms has
changed the whole picture.”

There are no definite plans in
Tom’s future yet except for the fact
that he likes to dive and wants to
continue doing it. He hasn’t made
his mind up definitelyv about
anything else. '

This is his first year on the three
meter,board. but he is picking it up
very quickly. His diving repertoire
hassteadily grown since he arrived
in the fall and has already won in
the new event for him.

There is still a lot of hard work,
and many hours of it, in store for
Tom Faytol. He has the potential.
desire and most important of all. he
has the ability.
