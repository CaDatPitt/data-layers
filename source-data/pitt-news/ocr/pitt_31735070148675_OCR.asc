Sodexo serves thousands of hun- V

gry students each day, but the

employees and volunteers at‘

Market Central will try to make

Christmas Day a little more spe— ,

cial for people in tough economic
circumstances. .
Pitt and Sodexo are holding
their sixth annual Christmas Day
Dinner at Market Central on Dec.
25. The event for the homeless
and needy includes a Christmas

dinner, gift—giving, a visit by Santa
and Mrs. Claus and take—home gift
bags ﬁlled with hat and glove sets
and leftover food.

Abdou Cole, the general man-
ager of "Sodexo at Pitt, said the
event has grown over the years
and is expected to grow even more

in the future. While the‘event fed .

1,150 people last year, this year
"Sodexo" is preparing dinner for be-
tween 1,350 and 1,500 people.
He said that for some of the
families, this event is the “biggest
hit of the year.” I
The Salvation Army works with

social service agencies to deter-
mine those who will be invited
to the event. Pitt international
students are also welcome at the
event, since many are unable to go
home over winter break.
Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Community Relations John Wilds
said the annual event is a “total
partnership” between Sodexo

and Pitt. Between ﬁnancial re- '

sources and donated.labor, Pitt
pays for the majority of the food,
and Soqgxo employees make up a
large majority of the 150 to 200

‘ volunteers.

The organizers welcome any
students or staff who are available
to help out.

The volunteers come in the
night before to start preparing
meals and return on Christmas
morning at 6 a.m. to_set up. The
volunteers, including Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg, will serve food
between 11 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

Leftover food is never an is-
sue, Cole said, because volunteers
prepare take—ho'me meals and to-
go bags forelder members of the
families who are unable to attend
the dinner.

Gwen Watkins of the Office of
Government and Community Re— '

_ lations said that afterall the gifts

— many of which aredonated by
Pitt students and faculty —- are
given out to families and children,
the excess ones are handed out at
women’s shelters in Pittsburgh.
Watkins said international stu-
dents have attended the dinner
over the past four years, but she

saw the most participation at last -

“They love it, and it’s great

Pedicabs eco-friendly

Pedicab 4 1

Paul Kletter started his pedicab busi-
ness Green Gears — a leasing com-
pany that provides year-round envi-
ronmentally-friendly transportation,
tours around the city and advertising
banners on the sides of the pedicabs.
At Pittsburgh sporting events or on

 given weekend in the South Side,
V people can witness the bizarre spec-

tacle ofpedicabs,whicharebecoming
a more and more prevalent form of
emissions-ﬁee travel.

, Consistingofa rickshawpulled bya
single tenacious bicyclist, the pedicab
emerged in Pittsburgh when Kletter
started Green Gears in 2009. Kletter
partnered up with high school friend
Eddie DeCarlo to provide Pittsburgh
with a creative alternative to hailing
a taxi cab.

The result was Green Gears, and
since its inception, the cabs have been
usedatcountless public events through-
out Pittsburgh, from Pittsburglfs Three
Rivers Arts Festival and LightUp Night
to Pitt football games and Pittsburgh
Pirates games. , ,

With seven active cabs and more
being ordered, Green Gears’ pedicabs
are what Kletter called an “enjoyable
form of transportation.” As many as
three passengers can ride at once, and
each trip costs $5 to $20, depending on
the distance.

Kletter said that the pedicabs are
excellent not only‘because of their
emissions-free operation and accessi-
bility atpublic events, but also because
of how riveting the experience is for
passengers exploring Pittsburgh.

“They get excited,” Kletter said.
“You getthat Princess Dianawave down
and just feel on top of the world.”

One man went as far as to rent a
cab for the whole day. Dan Drischler,
a 48-year-old mechanic for Port Au-
thority, decided to make his wife’s
birthday extraspecial with the gas-free
surprise.

On Oct. 15, Drischler and his wife
were participating in a bar crawl ar-

ranged by the Ladies Ancient Order of

Hibernians Division23, anlrish Catho-
lic organization,whichhappenedtofall

on his wife’s birthday. '

ingss, couldn’thave been morethrilled

renceville, though bar crawls are typi-
cally walked.

Ricca said that she enjoyed the day
thoroughly, although she didn’t recall

. events toward the latter half ‘of the

crawl, after the ﬁfth bar.

-“I thinkIwaswell—behaved,” Ricca
said. “And [the driver] was fabulous
— very friendly and a lot cuter than
a horse,” she said, referring to Pettler,

who happened to be the driver that.

night. V
Though the ride through Law-

renceville was over relatively ﬂat

terrain, there 'was one particularly
daunting hill on 46th Street to Kelly’s
Korner.

“We walked up that one,” Drischler
said, laughing. He isatowering 6-foot-4
andweighs morethan300 pounds. “We
decided to cut -[the driver] a break.”

driver, who must pull the 120—pound
rickshaw plus the weight of up tothree
passengers, apotential 600 additional
pounds. Needless to say, the grueling
labor is not for the faint of heart.

In spite of the physical strain, Pet-

tlerconsiders his job idealforacollege ‘

, “It’s hard work with a lot of exer-
cise,” Pettler said. “You deﬁnitely earn

But whether you pedal or get ped-

glimpse toward the city’s ﬁiture.

EQITORIAL

'\

Transparency should
be PSU’s priority

Penn State’s reputation has suf— »
fered incalculably in the wake of ‘

Jerry Sandusky’s grand jury indict-
ment, and the subsequent student
riots only exacerbated matters.
It’s unsurprising, then, that the

- university’s President Rodney
Erickson felt obligated to make
bold, somewhat unconvincing as-
surances about the college’s inevi-
table rebound.

In a recent interview with USA
Today, Erickson promised to trans-
form Penn State from a football-
centric school to a “world-class
research institution.” He added
that the university planned to es-
tablish a Center for the Protection
of Children, a research and treat-
ment facility for victims of child
abuse that Big Ten revenues will
help support. 4

Although we’re glad the uni-
versity is taking steps to stop pe-
dophiles, we’re a bit disappointed
with Erickson’s pledges. Despite its
“party school” status, Penn State is
arguably already a “world—class”
institution ~— ranked 45th in the
country by U.S. News 8: World
Report and 43rd in the world by
the Academic Ranking of World
Universities. Furthermore, we
don’t think excelling at football
and academics are mutually ex-
clusive (see: Stanford).

What we would rather hear
from Erickson are a few concrete
proposals for increasing Penn
State’s transparency. Bureaucracy,
not just insensitivity, allowed these
alleged abuses to go unchecked.
Somewhere in that chain of com-
mand, someone failed to do his
or her-job.

To ensure this alleged negli-
gence isn’t repeated, we suggest

allowing police — local police, -
not campus police — access to
all internalinvestigations of il-
legal activity at every level. Had
someone‘ immediately notiﬁed
State College law enforcement
of Mike McQueary’s allegations,
the worst of this ﬁasco‘ might have
been avoided.

Penn State should also consider

a more thorough restructuring
of its administrative hierarchy.
Whatever codes of conduct hold
faculty and staff to inadequate
ethical standards merit a com-
plete overhaul, and whoever was
complicit in the alleged cover-up
— the list seems to grow larger
each day —— should be suspended
or ﬁred.

To his credit, Erickson did
pledge in a town hall meeting to
“raise the visibility of ethics in
the university,” and to create an
environment in which students
“feel free, either individually or as
groups of students,_ to approach”
the administration.

He’s also, in his list of “ﬁve-
promises,” dedicated himself to
encouraging a “dialogue” with
community members. Thus far,
however, he hasn’t delved into
speciﬁcs.

Despite Sandusky’s alleged
crimes, Penn State is not, to the
best of our knowledge, a breeding
ground for pedophiles.

-Thus, although the University’s
efforts to help abuse victims are
admirable, they don’t address a
crucial problem: administrative
oversight. This is Penn State’s
chance to demonstrate a real com-
mitment to transparency. Let’s
hope its leaders don’t settle for
anything less. I

Think we're crazy?

Era-defining Christmas Songs

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Grab a steaming cup of cocoa and

some peppermint schnapps, be-

cause we’ve reached the heart of
the Christmas Season — that time
of year when we all celebrate our
collective lack of restraint. Don’t
have enough cash to buy 17 designer

' dog sweaters? Add it to your credit

card bill. Eaten enough to satisfy the
entire nation of Cameroon? Shovel
in some more ﬁggy pudding regard-
less.

The season’s soundtrack, inci-
dentally —— the endless series of
popular Christmas songs that as-
sail us for hours each day — is just
as overindulgent as our behavior.
While normal pop music isn’t what

you would call restrained — “Last '

Friday Night” could have just been

Scrabble with friends — Christmas '
music allows us to reject the very I

real expressive limitations of nor-
mal pop music.

What do musicians do when
their Christmas song doesn’t pop
with enough energy? Add some ob-
noxious sleigh bells and “oohs” and

“ahhs” that listeners would mock.

during any other month. Not emo-
tional enough‘? Cue the schmaltzy
strings and key changes. Most im-

portantly, not high—rr1inded enough? _

Add some allusions to world peace,
or better yet, a children’s choir, and
watch normally very reasonable hu-
mans ﬁnd very unreasonable senti-
mentalism completely acceptable.

These conventions don’t actu-

ally anger me at all — it’s refresh— ,

ing to experience some popular art
form that’s not obsessed with itself.
Furthermore‘, because Christmas
music is by its very nature canoni-
cal — we hear and expect to hear
the same music for manyyears —
listening to it gives us a chanceto

undertake some serious cultural

self-reﬂection.

We’re surrounded by songs that '

remind us how we’ve changed since
the 7405 and ’5os, the Golden Age
of Christmas music. We can see a
version of ourselves that wasn’t
concerned with overindulgence. In

some ways, this is one of the most
' authentic ways‘ to experience the

past. _

Here, then, is an examination
of the most culturallydeﬁning
Christmas songs of th‘e'jpast four
decades, and some explanations

of what they say:

1970s — “War is Over” byjohn,

Lennon and Yoko Ono.

Given free reign, Lennon and

Ono decided to be repetitious in the
interest of world peace: They took
the most pervasive cultural idea and
augmented it by adding a haunt-
ing children’s chorus repeating the
same four notes to the words “war
is over.” With this, and the modula-
tions’ constantly heightened emo-
tion, the song underscores how dra-
matized 1970s music was — ever
hear “Cat’s in the Cradle”?
' 1980s -— “Feed the World” by
Band Aid _ A
Soviet- era black-and-white con-
trasts are painfully pronounced
when Bono sings this song’s fa-
mous line, “Tonight thank God it’s
them / instead of you,” expressing
his gratefulness that he wasn’t one
of those people starving in Africa.
The over-the-top message —— that a
bunch of superstars are here to save
the world from darkness —— is also.
consistent with the re-emergence
of nationalism and the “go get
’em” attitude in Ronald Reagan’s
U.S. and Margaret Thatcher’s Great
Britain. ; '

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND

By Liz Keeney_
STAFF WRITER

As the cold wind blew in off the three rivers, skaters
bundled up in their warmest winter gear glided around
the rink at PPG Place. They gleefully ignored the chill
in the air as they waved to family and friends who

snapped photos of them whizzing by. The lights of  '

the rink’s central Christmas tree reflected off the V 
surrounding buildings, casting a warm glow on i
the skaters.
The holiday season isn’t just a chance for

Pittsburghers to participate in wintry tradi-

tions, it’s also a time to celebrate the city.
Downtown is decadently decorated in lights

and holiday imagery.

It starts in mid—November with Light ,

Up Night, the season’s official kick—off.

This year the event took place on Nov. 19.

The holiday lights were officially turned on,

displays were constructed and the rink at PPG
Place opened. People looked on as a surviving
cancer victim lit the Tree of Life at the center
of the ice rink.

That gesture marked the rink’s opening.
Managed by Magic Ice USA, the rink has
been around since 2001. It’s an interesting
juxtaposition oflight and ice, smack dab
in the middle of the city, surrounded on
. all sides by reﬂective glass buildings.
At night, the rink is a bright, glittery

oasis in the middle ofthe city.
Rink manager Harry Datz said that
the ice rink provides an experience

people of any age can enjoy.

There are so many storylines and
characters that it’s hard to remem-
ber what’s happening to everyone.
The star—studded cast becomes
more distracting than beneﬁcial.
It’s a blinding collection of “it” stars
from Hollywood, constantly run-
ning in and out of the frame.

All those stars and good inten-
tions inevitably alienate the audi-
encej by trying to Acovergtoo many
New-'Y_e,ar’s,Eve conundrums. Since
the movie doesn’t follow any char— A
acter or story long enough for the
audience to develop a relationship,
it creates a hodgepodge of stories
the audience is barely attached to.
 Almost all A f the gimations feel

     

 

There is too much to absorb in a
singlesitting. For a story about New
York’s glitziest night of the year,
the movie just does not dazzle. If

, Marshall takes on another holiday,

hopeﬁllly he will follow the “less is
more” principle. I

Movie REVIEW

Today’s difficulty level: Medium ‘Y0ungAdu1t’ movie has
Puzzles by Pamwcom some maturing to do

By Brian Dollard
STAFF WRITER

“Young Adult”

Starring: Charlize Theron, Patton Os-
Walt ‘

Directed byjason Reitman

Grade: B- I

No yearbook superlatives will be coming for
“Young Adult,”the tale of a woman dealing
with the post—prom—queen blues.

Mavis Gary’s (Charlize Theron) struggle
to salvage her writing career is interrupted
by an invitation to celebrate the new baby
of her ex—.high school ﬂame, Buddy Slade
(Patrickllllgilson). Determined to  Buddy
away fromhis wife, f~  A r
the delusional Mavis
decides to drive back
to her small town
of Mercury, Minn.
The entire time she
blasts one of Buddy’s
old mix tapes, con-
stantly rewinding
to give the ﬁrst song
another listen.

Mavis soon dis-
covers that, unlike
the tape, her life
can’t be so easily re-
wound back to her
’90s glory days. She’s -
an alcoholic who only survives mornings by

_ the saving grace of her breakfast two lite'r

bottle of Diet Coke. She spends her days in
Mercury preparing for Buddy, careﬁ1lly cov-'
ering each crack in her perfect veneer.
Much like Mavis, “Young Adult” suffers
from a certain superﬁciality. It presents it-
self as a ﬁlm about a Woman with mental
issues who spirals to a personal rock bottom.

But the ﬁlm misses any introspection by the

main character. The movie’s sloppy, forced
ending leaves the audience frustrated and
unsatisﬁed.

The ﬁlm tries for a strong, dramatic tone,

y»

scene.

99

but it remains underdeveloped. .

Where the movie’s drama is a painful
chore to endure, its humor is a subtle joy.
This is a unsurprising fact, considering the
ﬁlm shares a creative tandem with “Juno”
— both were directed byjason Reitman and
written by Diablo Cody.

“Young Adult” excels at the little things.
Reitman pulls humor out of nearly every
scene, and normally from unexpected
sources.

The hilarity of Mavis’ dumbfounded look
as she gazes at the pinnacle of suburbia — a
combined KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut that
she calls “KenTaco Hut” — is lasting. Her

- humorous exchanges with store clerks and
3‘ cashiers often represent the strongest points
'__ ofthe movie. _  — * B

  
    

“Adult” is ﬁlled
with great situational
humor. Her “court-
ing” of the unavail-
able Buddy leads to a
wealth of exception-
ally cringe—inducing
dialogue. To Theron’s
credit, the success of
these scenes hinges
primarily on her
ability to create two
starkly different per-
sonalities of Mavis —
a self-important nar-
cissist around people
A and a broken, unful-
ﬁlled, self—hating person internally.

Other than Buddy, the only acquaintance

. Mavis ﬁnds left in town is the crippled Matt

Freehauf (Patton Oswalt). Her invisible lock-
er—neighbor in high school, he serves as both
the comedic balance to her indefensible plans
and her main drinking partner. Oswalt gives
a strong performance as an effortlessly funny
but genuine Matt. - _

Yet the humor and goodwill of the ear-
lier portions of the ﬁlm do not atone for the
dramatic predictability and sloppiness of the
ending. “Young Adult” would beneﬁt from
some added maturity of plot. 3

Time-wasting websites not .

Natalie Bell
Magazine Editor

Once upon a time,lthere were two friends
named Procrastination and Internet.

They liked holding hands and skipping
through ﬁelds of wildflower jigsaw puzzles

and cute puppy videos. They spent hours
V exploring each other’s interests and passions. 4

Internet always knew just where Procrastina-
tion wanted to go. — V, _ A.
One day while on a walk, they Stumbled

and fell into a" great dark "hole. On the other
- sidé existed a world— sometimes funny, ,

sometimes dark and sinister —— where friends
called Pages showed them things of which
they:‘cou.ld never have dreamed. 4 J '— 7;:

T Thevend. * Q ‘g ‘ "i

That happily distorted picture, my friends,
is more than likely your night in the Hillman
Library — fueled by free coffee and deadline‘-
induced adrenaline. '

Oh, you promised yourself you’d work for
real. Maybe you even downloaded one of those
nifty temporary site blockers — keeprneout.
com/en/ 4 so social networking'wouldn’t
distract you. But here’s what no one ever tells
you: Even helpful sites have a dark side.

. Their educational nature makes them
seem innocuous. Much like cute furry animals
that could, kill you, these study aids might
derail you. ' - > » A

. The creators of TED (Technology, Educa-
tion and Design) trumpet the site as being

full of “ideas worth spreading.” And they are, .

except that one video leads to another. U_n-

like YouTube videos, which lean toward the _

shorter side, one video on TED might cost
you nearly 20 minutes. - _ ' O

So whatif you were supposed to writea 10-
page paper on the consequencesofstandard-,

7 izing the grade schoolsystem in the U.S.? ,
Sure, you might glean something from cre-

ativity expert Ken Robinson’s chat “Do schools
kill creativity?” But then you can’t help but
watch Tinkeringschool founder Gever Tulley

' talk about “5 dangerousthings you should let

you kids do” — followed by a heated debate
with your tablemate about “How young is 
young to play with knives?” . ;;,é_‘
Even sites like rn”erriam-webstencorn 
to get your laser-focused concentration 
to jump the tracks. _ _ . V , . T,-
Start looking up synonyms for “good”.
and soon you’re offered a procrastination
buffet. On the front page alone, there are
countless time wasters: vocabulary quizzes,

  
   
 

  

 
 

  , jfre lfemaneni r+(’avc ﬁemoral Exfe/dis

,3 Squirrel Hill at Forbes & Shady Ave."
l~-m

always attelliion black holes  

trend watches, popularity lists, words of the
day, etc. ' _ —

And you’ll tell yourself it’s OK because
you’re “learning.” No matter if that hour spent

acquainting yourselfwith 16th century insults

is applicable, you bettered yourself with edu-
cation, dammit. ’

‘ . But there’s an upside: The sites you thought

could only waste your time might actually help
you with work. a
Twitter probably seems like Satan’s play-
pen when you’re trying to do work. It’s full
of hilarious one-liners, and you think you’ll
"stop in ﬁve minutes —— until you’re suddenly

- six months back on Kim Kardasliian’s tweets

wondering how you became this kind of per-
son."'   .

V j But scrollingtharough'I‘witterdoesn’thave
to lead to bouts of selflloathing as you stalk

your celebrity obsession. There’s alight at the T

‘end of the tunnel, and that light is that people

. don’t only force their uneducated politics_on .

_ you or share pictures of their dog in a Santa
suit on Twitter. They also share important

, ‘things. - ' T i T

' We often think of hashtags as amusement.
For example, yesterday, #thedreamer was
trending. That probably won’t help write your
term paper. _ T _ _

But using hashtags as a topicsearch for

4 paper topics, such as #arabspring, will deﬁ-

nitely yield helpful results. -Morethan -likely,‘

-you won’t get bogged down with too many

inane comments. And, unlike many ‘search

- tools, the 140-character limit makes ﬁltering

easier e not enough room for crazies to go
on tangents. '

. Tweets‘ themselves are rarely helpful — '
but the links posted with them can often have _

information that would have been difficult to
ﬁnd in a Google search.
The same can be true for Facebook. Those

' politically charged friends who drive you cra-

ALBUM REVIEW

Kate Bush’s album

By Gareth Gebhardt
STAFF WRITER

50 Words For Snow

Kate Bush

Anti- '

Grade: C+

Rocks Like: A sleepy Bjiirk

A promotional video on YouTube for50 Ll’/ordr

for Snow, the latest musical effort from English
musician/singer Kate Bush, centers on scenes
of intimate human-snowman cuddling in a dark
bedroom. One might understandably make the
assumption that, like the scenes, the album
too offers something in the way of eccentric
entertainment.

Unfortunately, that assumption would be
incorrect. Instead, the main characteristic of 50
ll’/ordrfor 51201;/is — well, that it’s very boring.

True to its title, the album does in fact re-
volve around snow and other various winter
concepts, including cold weather, ice and things
that seem never to end. The instrumentation
conveys _a distinctly chilled, wintery feel that’s
unique to 50 Words. Subtle reverb ﬂoats just
below the surface of the vocals and melodies
to create an austere, open atmosphere, while

occasional swells from stringed instruments
or ﬁnger—style guitar add nice touches. Most
of the melody come from Bush’s piano, which
unfortunately sounds abit like George Winston
covering Vince Guaraldi while under the inﬂu-
ence of assorted sleeping pills. l

“Snowﬂake,” the album’s ﬁrst track, follows
the long, airy journey from sky to earth of a
falling snowﬂake. It’s an interesting concept,
but the dragging tempo and simple, repetitive
piano refrain make it difficult to listen to with
any enthusiasm. Bush’s lyrics — “I was born in
a cloud / Now I am falling / I want you to catch
me / Look up and you’ll see me / You know you
can hear me” — create some nice imagery, but
their short, declarative nature means the song
ends up feeling a bit childish. T

The title track is precisely what it says it is
— Bush and a male vocalist whisper 50 differ-
ent terms for snow, counting down the number
as if in some weird version of “99 Bottles of

Beer on the Wall.” It’s the kind of high—concept ~

If you’re feeling impatient, 50 Words for

meandering, and is better suited for a mid-

Pitt's Alternative Break program is much more than a volunteer experience over spring break.
The program offers community based projects that include engagement with members of the

community and exposure to the problems, customs and culture of the region. Our teams are

trained by the community partner to understand the specific content of their service work and
are prepared to carry out their tasks. Alternative Break creates an experience that inﬂuences
participants to reflect on the impact and meaning of their service, to transfer what they have
learned to their own communities and to start them on a course of lifelong active citizenship.

what we do on Alternative Break?

During the week of Alternative Break, a team of Pitt students participate in a daily volunteering
service project with a local nonprofit organization or community partner. Students travel by
chartered bus, train or van to the service site. The sponsoring agency gives an orientation that
outlines the social issues and local impact in the community. Students participate in 30 hours
of service over 4 days with community participants. The last day is set aside for sightseeing
and exploring the area. The team leader ends each day with group and individual reﬂection.
Alternative Break is drug and alcohol-free.

Alternative Break....it’s the break that will last a lifetime!

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Georgetown, Rodgers roll Panthers

Gregory Trietley
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

For much of the ﬁrst half of the
Pitt :women’s— basketball team’s
game against No. 19 Georgetown,
just crossing the half-court line —‘
not to. mention scoring — was a
challenge. V --

‘ Georgetown’s press frustrat-
ed Pitt all game,:and the Hoyas
thumped the Panthers 82-54
in both teams’ Big East opener
Wednesday night at the Petersen
Events Center. ‘ ~

Junior guard Sugar Rodgers
scored 28 points for the Hoyas
(8-2, 1-0 Big East), who held Pitt
to 3-for-19 from the floor to start
the game. The Panthers (4-5, 0-1
Big East) had ﬁve turnoversin
the game’s ﬁrst ﬁve -minutes, as
Georgetown trapped and pressed
the inexperienced group to force
costly mistakes.

“We’re actually one of the only
teams in the country that actually
presses all 40 minutes,” George-
town head coach Terri Williams-
Flournoy said after the game.
“When we say we press, we press.
Most teams who say they press,
they press after a free throw.”

The Panthers had 24 turnovers
compared to Georgetown’s 16.

Unable to do much in the paint

against 6—foot-6 center Sydney, .

Wilson, Pitt leaned on its perim- »
eter scorersfor offense, but the
Panthers started 0-for-7 from
3-point range. By the time guard
Abby Dowd hit Pitt’s ﬁrst 3-point-
er with 6:18 remaining in the ﬁrst
half, Georgetown had built a com-
fortable 29-12 lead.

Pitt had a nearly 11-minute
span in which it missed 14 con-

- secutive shots.

“Going that long atime without
getting a score is toug ,” sopho—.
more center Leeza Burdgess said.‘
“We were getting stops, ﬁnally
getting our defense together, and
then it’s a little disappointing that
the shots that you get weren’t go-
ing in.”

The Panthers ﬁnished 1—for-21
from 3-point range and shot 26.7
percent overall.

At the other end, Georgetown
found soft spots in Pitt’s zone,
with senior forward Tia Magee

attacking the rim and using quick
passes to free Rodgers and Taylor

Brown at guard. The pair’s strong

play forced the Panthers to switch
out of zone to start the second
half. ‘ L

Georgetown ﬁnished with 20
assists on 29 baskets. Magee and
Brown each had 12 points.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
generated some momentum for

the team in the second half when °

she put Burdgess and freshman
forward.Cora McManus on the
court together. But Georgetown’s
defense proved too dominant, and
the Hoyas pulled away by out—bat-
tling Pitt for loose balls.
Burdgess finished with 10
points and seven rebounds in
her ﬁrst start of the season, and

%

McManus had three points and
six rebounds.
“I’m so excited for [Burdgess]

as a ﬁrst—time starter,” Berenato
said after the game. “Leeza just

worked so hard in the last couple
of weeks. -Leeza made us put her
in the lineup.”

Sophomore Asia Logan had a
career-high 15 points off the bench
in the loss. She played power for-
ward against the Hoyas after play-
ing small forward on Pitt’s recent
road trip.

“Asia really has been versatile
for us, almost like a utility play-
er,” Berenato said. “We needed
her quickness at the four, and I
said, ‘Asia, I need to have you at
the four,’ and she said, ‘No prob-

Pitt won’t play another Big
East game for nearly a month.
Villanova hosts the Panthers on
Jan. 3 at 7 p.m.

Berenato said that shelwill
continue to have a difficult early-
season schedule because that is
what is best for the Panthers in
the long run.

“You all know what the Big East
is,” she said. “But if we’re going
to play, and we’re going to take it
on the chin, I want my student-
athletes to play against the best
and not have any false perception
of what it’s like. We have a goal
that one day we want to win big.
This crew, when they’re juniors
and seniors, can do that. But they
can’t do that if we go 10-0 and
then play in the Big East.” ﬂ

 

WRESTLING

Panthers
prep for
Buckeyes’
visit

”‘;:}‘::i:’;%

When someone references the,‘

number six to Pittsburgh fans,
most think of the Steelers’ six-
pack of Super Bowls. But for the
Panthers’ wrestling team, the
number six might take on a whole
new meaning. ,

On Friday night, the Panthers
(3-0) will wrestle No. 6-ranked
Ohio State (4-0). The Buckeyes
are the third team Pitt has wres-
tled that entered the match with
such a ranking.

A victory for the Panthers,.
would be their third win over a
No. 6-ranked opponent, after
wins over Lehigh and Michigan.

This time around, the Pitt team
is not as much of an underdog as
it was when the season began. On
Dec. 6, the team rose to No. 9 in
the NCWA/USA Today Coaches
Poll.

Last week, Pitt entered the top
10 for the ﬁrst time since 1963.
Now the goal for the Panthers is
not to hold their ground, but ton
continue improving and growing
as a team.

“We have to keep doing what
we do,” assistant coachjason Pe-
ters said following the win over
Michigan. “We’re going to keep g
trying to work hard and execute 5‘
what we work in practice and let
the rankings take care of them-
selves.”

Despite key wins over Lehigh
and Michigan, Ohio State might
be the team’s stiffest competition-1
to date. The Buckeyes are coming
off a team title at the Cliff Keen
Invitational in Las Vegas, where
the Panthers ﬁnished in eighth
place. In Las Vegas, eight of the
Buckeyes’ wrestlers placed in the g
top six at the tournament.

“I’m conﬁdent in our guys,”
Pitt assistant coach Matt Kocher

Although Las Vegas wasn’t a huge suc-
cess for the Panthers, head coach‘ Rande
Stottlemyer is ready to put it behind the
team. «

“To ﬁnish in the top 10 in the team scor-

ing means something to us,” Stottlemyer

At 133 pounds, Logan was the tournament

proven to be a tough group to beat.

Max Thomusseit, still battling back from
an upper extremity injury, did not place
in Las Vegas. Following the tournament,
the Pitt coaching staff was hopeful that
Thomusseit would turn it around in time
for the match with Ohio State. Thomus-

seit will match up with Ohio State’s C.j.“‘
Magrum, a two-time NCAA qualiﬁer.

‘‘I think that Max [Thomusseit] had a
little bit of a mental thing that he was go-
ing through in Vegas,” Kocher said. “He’s
a tough guy and he’s ready to go physically.
He needs to get his conﬁdence with his,
conditioning and skills that he’s had, but
he should be ready to go for us.”

At No. 5 in the nation at 197 pounds,
Matt Wilps has become the highest—ranked
Panther wrestler. Wilps has compiled a 12-2
record this season, including a perfect 3-0
mark in dual meets thus far. Wilps’ oppo-
nent from Ohio State -— Andrew Campolat-
tano, a freshman from New Jersey —— did
not place in Las Vegas. But Campolattano
does hold a stellar high school record of
178~1.

At heavyweight, the matchup will fea».
ture two wrestlers whom many would con-
sider to be undersized for the weight class.
Both the Panthers’ Zac Thomusseit and the
Buckeyes’ Peter Capone competed at 184
pounds and 197 pounds in the past before
bumping up to the heavyweight 285 pound
bracket. Capone ﬁnished in second place
in Las Vegas, while Zac Thomusseit sat out
with a minor injury.

The matchup between the two top—10—
ranked teams is set for Friday night at 7
p.m. in the Fitzgerald Field House. I

After six équally bad years in Colorado,
they jumped cross—country to NewJer-

since. -

That started a trend in the 1990s in
whichteams left rural, hockey—rich areas
in search ofbigger markets. In 1993, the
Minnesota North Stars went south after
26 years —-. and two Stanley Cup Finals
appearances — to land in Dallas.

1995 Colorado got a reprieve when
the Quebec Nordiques — 16-season

veterans of Canada — relocated and
became the Colorado Avalanche.

In 1996, the original Winnipeg Jets
moved to Phoenix to become the Coy-
otes — who are embroiled in their own

financial troubles with the possibility of

relocation. And in 1997, the Hartford
Whalers moved to Raleigh,.N.C., to be-
come the Carolina Hurricanes. ,
The last time the NHL needed to
tweak its divisions was in 1999,Vwhen
the Thrashers entered the league as an

expansion team (along with Minnesota’s

second chance, the Wild). Then, the NHL -_

moved from_four divisions — Smythe,
Norris, Adams and Patrick — to the
six geographicallynamed ones we. see

today. But those are soon to fall by‘ the

wayside as well.

According to ESPN.c_om, in order to

create a more balanced travel format for

7 all teams while attempvtingto maintain

rivalries, NHL Commissioner Gary Bet-

tman and the Board of Governors have

Four yet—to—be—named conferences

Every team will be guaranteed a home-

of the eight—team conferences,Vand the

' other will contain the central—time—zone
teams of Chicago, Columbus, Dallas,

Detroit, Minnesota, Nashville, St. Louis
and Winnipeg. ' i '

The problem with this realignment
appears to come at playoff time. The top

four teams in each conference will make - —-
.th‘e playoffs and the first two rounds will
be used to determine the champion of _

each respective conference. Details be-
yond those, however, are still undecided,
as the league has yet to decidewhether
to reseed from that point on or work

‘based on predetermined matchups.

There has already been griping over
whether the Players’ Association (N HL~
PA) has to pass off on the plan or not.
Bettman says no; the NHLPA says yes.
The proposal received the 2o—out-of—3o

_ team votes needed to pass and there’s

been speculation on what the.new con-

seems to be the old, Smythe, Norris,
