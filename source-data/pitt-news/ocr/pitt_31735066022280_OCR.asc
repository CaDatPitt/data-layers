18, in the head and pushed him
around the lobby at 12:10 a.m.
last Monday morning. Mitchell
reported that Todd was injured
but refused medical attention and
he was uncertain whether to

- press charges.

”I don't have anything to do

with it,” said Lane, a 6-6,
215—pound sophomore forward
who led the nation in rebound-
ing last season. ”I’m not in-
volved. I have nothing to do with
It.”

Asked how his name turned up
in the police report, Lane
responded, ”I don't have any
idea. Listen, man, write whatever
you want. I gotta go and meet a
recruit.”

Todd, a freshman from Shady-
side, said he had never met Lane
— ”I had never talked to him be-
fore this” —— and that he did not
steal his car.

Kimbo names new
activities director

By Jim U rban
Editor—in—Chief

Pitt's Vice President for Student
Affairs Dr. Conney Kimbo
cleared up the confusion sur-
rounding the vacant Student Ac-
tivities director position on
Wednesday.

Kimbo announced that Joseph,
Cavalla, currently the director of
College Center and Student Acti-
vites at Rider College in Lawren-
ceville, N.J., has accepted the
position.

”It was the biggest decision that

' I have ever made,” Cavalla said

on Thursday.

The new director will assume
the position on June 15. He
replaces Andy Smith, who left
Aug. 15, 1986, to become direc-
tor of the Texas Union at the
University of Texas.

Dr. Terry Milani and Joyce
Giangarlo, who served as co-
acting directors during the in-
terim, return to their previous po-
sitions. .

Milani will be associate direc-

-tor, and Giangarlo an assistant

director.

”Joe Cavalla is highly qualified
for the position,” Kimbo said.
”He hadoutstanding references,
and he has a good national repu-
tation.”

Cavalla was recently appointed

. vice-president for Regional Affairs

of the Association of College

Unions-International. A week
later Kimbo offered him the ac-
tivities director position.

”So I'm batting a thousand,” he I

joked.

Kimbo said that he was looking
for a candidate who had an ex-
tensive background in student de-
velopment, as well as extensive

experience in student—union
management.

He believes he found that in
Cavalla.

”We want to continue im-
provement in .the student de-
velopment end of Student
Activities,” Kimbo said. ”It’s not
that we have been weak in that
area, but we want to continue im-
proving.” ‘

With Cavalla’s appointment,
no immediate moves are expect-
ed to be made in the Office of
Student Activities. The current
Student Activities staff would
most likely remain intact.

’’I don't foresee any changes
thatihe would make,” Kimbo
said.

”There is a super staff out
there,” Cavalla added. ”The as-
sistant directors, the ones I met,
are very competent professionals.
I'll look, see what they are doing
and see where I can help."

Cavalla has held his current po-

sition at Rider since 1968. He-

opened the three-story student
center at Rider in 1970 and has

grabbed me,” said Todd, 6-1,
172. ”We tussled around for
about 30 seconds, and when
somebody screamed that a cop
was coming, he stopped.

VOLUME E|G'HTY-ONE, ISSUE SEVENTY-NINE

”He accused me of stealing his
car while he was hitting me. He
was saying, ’You stole my car.’ ”

Lane admitted that his car, a
black Chevrolet Camaro Berlinet-
ta bearing an Ohio license plate,
had been stolen. His grand-
mother, Ella Lane, said she had
come from Akron, Ohio, to Pitts-
burgh to report the car stolen, as
the registration was in her name.

Neither Pittsburgh police nor
campus police have any report of
the car being stolen, however.

She also said the car had been
recovered and is being serviced
at Don Allen Chevrolet on Baum
Boulevard.

Athletic Director Ed Bozik said,
”I have no ‘official’ information.

’I have nothingto do with it’  

Lane denies report that he fought student over stolen car

If it is true, and I underline the

word if, we will handle it through I

our normal procedure.”

According to the report, Mitch-
ell told Todd he could file
charges with District Magistrate
Nicholas Diulus or make a com-
plaint with the Office of Resi-
dence Life. Todd said last night
he will not press charges against
Lane. .

Lane was named third-team
All-American by the Associated
Press last season. Earlier this
week, Lane and Pitt teammate
Charles Smith were among 63
college basketball players invited
to audition for the U.S. team in
the Pan American Games this
summer in Indianapolis.

The decision came after a

The election was «contested

Florida Supreme! Court rejectsappeal of inmate

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The
Florida Supreme Court rejected
for a second time Thursday an ap-
peal by death row inmate Jeffrey
Daugherty in a 5-0 opinion.

Daugherty, 31, was sentenced
to the electric chair in Brevard
County for the March 1, 1976,
murder of hitchhiker Lavonne
Patricia Sailor near Melbourne.
He also is serving life sentences
for three other murders in Volu-
sia and Flagler counties and Hol-
lidaysburg, Pa.

The justices rejected several ar-
guments because they either
were or could have been raised
during their first appeals.

The high court also rejected the
argument that he received in-
effective legal counsel during the
sentencing phase of his trial be-

cause his lawyer failed to call a

psychologist as a witness.

His current lawyers argued that
the testimony could have present-
ed evidence for mitigating cir-

'cumstances against the death
penalty, including the influence .

Protection upgraded, but students still up in arms

By Laura Montuoro
For The Pitt News

Local police have been under
scrutiny recently for the way they
have been tackling the violence
problem that surfaced last sum-
mer when bands of youths ha-
rassed passersby in front of a
popular student hangout — "The
O.”

Though the problem appears to
have subsided, police are still on
alert to prevent repeat incidents.

According to Gary Moses, as-
sistant director of campus police
in charge of operations, in Janu-
ary the campus police readjusted
their normal schedule to allow

V. wo to three extra officers out

m 7 p.m. through 3 a.m.,
rsday through Saturday nights

I in response to the need for extra

protection. -

Moses also said that the cam-
pus police, in cooperation with
the Pittsburgh Police have just
two weeks ago reinstated a pro-
gram called Impact Detail. This is
a program that was started in Oc-
tober of 1986 and discontinued
in November of the same year.

Commander Joseph Wind,
who is in charge of Oakland,
could not be reached for ‘com-
ment at press time.

”The program was reinstated in
response to an increased number
of juveniles and young adults in
the Oakland area. Four extra men
from the university police are
paired with four men from the
city police,” said Moses. This
pairing occurs on the weekend
evenings. _ _

Moses said the situation has im-
proved because of the increased
protection and that there have
been fewer reported crimes in

Oakland.

Jon Axelsson, a student who
lives off campus, said that he
thinks the police are doing a
good job.

”I’ve lived in an apartment for
three years, and I'm always very
cautious. I look behind my back
and know what's going on when
walking home. I try to avoid any
trouble,” said Axelsson.

However, some students who
must walk off campus say they
still believe protection is inade-
quate because the police are con-
centrated in one area and are not
paying enough attention to the
surrounding areas.

”I don't feel safer,” said a Pitt
student who lives in an off-
campus apartment. ”I still walk
down the side streets and feel
nervous. There are -30 cops by
’The O’ and none anywhere
else."

According to a Pitt student who
lives on campus, ”The only time
you hear of people getting hurt
are on the side streets. They
should have extra police protec-
tion for those areas. It's stupid for
anyone to walk alone on the side
streets off of Forbes and Fifth
avenues. I feel perfectly safe on
Forbes and Fifth.”

”I have noticed the increase in
police protection,” said a recent

3

victim of a crime in Oakland who
wished to remain unidentified.
”Yet, I dont feel any safer. I stay
_on the main streets.”

’’I have not noticed any in-
creased police protection,” said
Beth Nigro, a student living in the
residence halls. ’’I was walking
home alone last Thursday night
and did not see one policeman
on my way. That does not make
me feel safe at all.”

Things get hot
at Duquesne U.

Over the last week, there has been a considerable uproar at
Dusquesne University over the managerial posture taken by
Dusquesne President Donald Nesti regarding the suspension
of the Tamburitzan staff.

According to Nesti and others in the administration at.

Dusquesne, the staff of the Tamburitzans was operating out-
side the guidelines set forth by the university. I

After the decision, the students and faculty called for the resig-
nation of Nesti and Vice President for Academic Affairs Ronal-
do Bonachea. They claimed that these administrators had
violated the trust of the university by firing the Tamburitzan
staff without notice.

In a meeting behind closed -doors, six members of the board

. ofdirectors accepted the story told by Nesti and gave him their

vote of approval. Also, there was a recommendation, pending
approval of a governing board, that an outside group of profes-
sionals look into the situation to decide whether Nesti acted
appropriately. _

That proposal was supported by members of the student
government and the faculty.

In any college setting, there will always be friction between
the students, the faculty and the administration. Such situations
can hardly be avoided.

However, open dialogue should be given a fair chance be-
fore the resignation of the people involved is called for. Wed_-
nesday night, such a dialogue was opened and was met with
a less than enthusiastic response from some students. .

The students, though, as well as the board of directors, ac-
knowledge that all the facts are not yet known. Both sides ad-

. mit that the whole story has yet to be told.

Then why, someone might ask, are there already calls for Nes-
ti’s resignation?
It is a good question.

Women have tobe willing to fight for equality

than some of the men I've met in
my lifetime. If you believe in
equal rights, you must also agree

I would like to expound upon
a comment made by Kelley Butt
in her article about sexism. Kel-

 

ley- feels that women aren't treat-

ged equally, and they rightfully

should be treated equally. I agree.
But she [said], "Today’s woman
does not demand the right to go
to the front line in combat.” Poor

‘ choiceof words, Ms. Butt. Con-

ditional equality doesn't exist.

' You can_’t have equal rights with

stipulations exempting a group

. [that] enjoys ‘those rights from

defending them.

In addition, it isn't a "right" to
defend our country. It is our duty.
I am a firm believer in ma|e/fe-
male combat forces. It works in
Israel, and I would rather be fight-
ing beside certain women I know

that these rights should be equal-

' Iy defended by all.

I am sure many women will say
that rape and sexual torture
would be the order of the day, if
they were captured by a ques-
tionable enemy, since females
would be the minority in battle
and war isn't conducive to civi-
lized behavior, i.e. Vietnam. But
this has happened to men as well
in war, and the details are too
sickening to go into. The point is
that all people (male and female)
suffer in war. And, since men and
women are equal, they should
equally share the duty of defend-
ing our country and the rights that

Columnized drivel

Congratulations, Matthew
Thornton, for your three columns
of drivel on April 6. In 11 para-
graphs you completely missed
the point. You [stated] that ”a de-
cision so personal as the one of
contracted motherhood should

not be legislated ..." and "  if
a woman wishes to have a child,
and then give up her rights to the
child, it is not a decision we
should interfere with.”

Wonderful. But what happens
if mom makes‘ such a contract,
and her wishes, that you make so
much of, change? Suppose it's
taken to court? Do you know
what legislation is? It is aiprotocol
which, in this case, allowsone to
prioritize mom's personal feel-
ings about her child against the
rules of the marketplace. Perhaps

- though youprefer Solomon's so-

lution?

ing me sick. I gotta be me.

Marriage

"For better or for worse, in sick-
ness and in the health, till death
do you part. ...," -— what a bunch

I ‘ of crap.

Granted, these words represent
a beautiful, romantic, intimate
bond between two human be-
ings, but ,c'mon who are we
kidding? V , 1

Imagine waking up every day
with the same person for the rest
of your life, seeing him or her at
his or her absolute worst, having
him or her see you. Think about
supporting and raising a family,
paying bills, insurance, taxes,
spending your life with the same
person day after day, week after
week, month after month, etc.
Sounds boring? You're damn
right it does.

Of course, those die—hard Bra-

’ dy Bunch fans will say", ".But

when people are married, they're
in love. They want to share each
other’s lives." Unfortunately, this

theory fizzles out after the first 5 *

years.
I'm as romantic as the next guy,

but I also understandreality. One _

out of every two couples are get-
ting divorced.

Divorce has become a natural
part of our lifestyle. Countless TV
dramas, after-school specials and
multi—million dollar movies have
portrayed the painful process of
divorce. Society loves it.

I'll admit people go for wed-
dings, too. But think about how
weddings are represented in the
movies and on television. Every-
one is dressed up, half—drunk and
happy. The bride and groom are
clean-cut, drug-free, good-
looking, likable young'people.

three adorable chi|dren,vlive in a
big house and happily grow old
together. It's scary, some people
actually believe that's the way it
works.

Remember all those times you
"went steady" with someone,
back in high school. On the aver-
age, it lasted a couple months,
and then you would start dating
your ex-girlfriend's or ex-
boyfriend's best friend. Perhaps,
after a month, you would get
back together with your "ex,"
and then it would start all over
again. Looking back, it was kind
of fun. However, few of us real-
ize that "going steady" is socie-
ty's way of preparing us for
marriage.

High school is an" intensely
emotional experience for all of
us. We'll never forget our first
love or lover, no matter how hard
we try. Yet, why don't high
school romances work out?
Usually a breakup evolves slow-
ly. Both people become less new

to each other and less exciting.
Soon they run out of things to say.
Their lives become a routine of
calling each other on the tele-
phone to talk about the same,
old, boring teachers. The appeal
of going to movies and parties
together fades, and eventually
they break up.

Marriage is no different. Sure,
there is more responsibility,
work, kids, a family dog. But the
emotions of high school still
linger. Adults are more mature

but not less sensitive. People get ~

tired of each other at any age.
Most people meet their hus-
bands and wives at our age. The
fate of marriage is just one more
pressure college students have to
work out. With all the confusion
the typical college-student has to

" deal with, it is not surprising to

see them make a mistake now
and then. Unfortunately, the mis-
take is usually on the altar.

But what about the successful
marriages? How do they do it?
They cheat.

As long as no one gets caught,
the marriage is happy and fulfill-
ing. Cheating is a part of our na-
ture. As children, from the
moment we steal a piece of bub-
ble gum from the neighborhood
grocery store, we express a hid-
den’ part of our personality.
Adultery is just another no-no we
all take a shot at once in a while.

There are one or two marriages
out there that break all rules of
logic and survive. However, they
just had a lucky toss of the coin.

I wish I didn't go into a
catatonic trance every time
an airplane takes off. You
can learn some interesting
things from the people sit-
ting next to you, but my
aversion to flying usually
puts me in such a daze that
by the time we land, I have
no recollection of any con-
versation I may have had
with my seatmate.

This happened just the
other week. It was a long
flight, and I think — I can't
be positive — that the man
sitting next to me was in the business of giving new names to
corporations. You know how it works: A big company decides
that it doesn't like its name, so it hires an outside consulting
firm to come up with a new name.

. I think the man in the next seat was explaining to me how

    

I
I
I

\

all this works. I think he gave me an example of a typical project: A

How a company is named, say, General Finance might fall out
of love with its name, and how he would put his staff to work
and finally come up with a new name — General International.

I think the man told me that computers were used in coming
up with all the new possible‘ names.

After we had landed safely, I found myself thinking about the 

conversation I had allegedly had. I wished that I had taken notes.
And then I saw a story in the newspaper. The American Can
Co. had announced that it planned to change its name to
Primerica Corp.

Gerald Tsai Jr., chairman of the-company, said the new name
combined the words "prime" and "America." He also said
American Can had hired a "corporate identity consulting firm,"
Lippincott and Margulies, to create the new name. _

So here was my chance. I got in touch with Lippincott and
Margulies; it wasn't the same firm as the one run by my air-
plane seatmate, but I figured the folks at Lippincott and Mar-

/gulies could answer my questions.

I spoke with Jill Gabbe, senior vice presidentof ‘Lippincott
and Margulies. She said that while the firm dealt in all aspects

of ”corporate identity," coming up with new names "is one‘

of our specialties."

She said that one of the trends in the corporate name-changing 7

business is to come up with a name that isn't in any dictionary

—— a name like Primerica. "It's incredibly difficult to find dic— J

tionary words to use," she said. "They're all taken."

So computers are put into use. "The computers are a tool,"

she said. "They take nonsense syllables and string them together
in every possible way. But the computers don't make the final
decision. As a rule, our names are decided by people."
Gabbe said that Lippincott and Margulies often tells a firm
that wants to change its name that it shouldn't change its name.
"There's got to be a very good business reason to do it," she
said. "We don't think it's a good idea for a company to change
its name just for the sake of change." . . '
Firms like Lippincott and Margulies charge hefty fees to come
up with new corporate names — the range is said to be from

$100,000 to $1 million —- and to the layman, that seemslilke

an awful lot. of money for a simple task’.
"But it's not as simple as you might think," Gabbe said. ”We

may spend over a year working on a new name for a compa-

ny. In changing American Can to Primerica, we came up with
easily 700 or 800 names. We had a whole name book.

"The new name has got to be phonetically pleasing, easy to
pronounce and not offensive to look at as far as the letters are
concerned. The lawyers are always checking to see if the name
has already.been taken, so we're pretty much in the business
of inventing new words." , .

I asked her what name changes — not ones necessarily done
by her company — struck her as especially brilliant.

"My favorite of all time is Amtrak," she said. "People don't!

remember, but before Amtrak the name was the National Rail-

road Passenger Association. Amtrak is short and distinctive —_ ' j   i

it gives you a mental picture of tracks streching across America. — . ”
''Humanna was also a great name change. Originally it was. 1

Extendicare Inc. It was one of the first for-profit hospitals, and I

it was important for the company to project just the right kind’
of feeling. Humanna was just an extension of the word 'human..’
But the extra 'a’ at the end made it a stand-alone word.’

"|’|| give you one more: Duracell. Duracell used to be E.F.  _'
Mallory and Co. Inc. Duracell is a much better name because‘ *

it tells you what you're getting — a durable cell battery." _
I asked Gabbe why corporate executives didn't just come up.

with new names by themselves, instead of hiring firms like hers. _
"Most executives see the process as tedious but necessary," A

she said. "They'd rather have someone else do it.
"And besides -— if the name flops with the public, you can
always blame the consultant." _

Male engineers more likely to excel, says study  

By Maud S. Beelman

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — A
university study of 1,100 fresh-
men engineering majors indicates
male students are likely to outper-
form their female colleagues even
when the two seem to be equal-
ly qualified.

The study, to be presented later
this month at the American
Educational Research Association
meeting in Washington, exam-
ined at students’ high school
grades, math and verbal scores

and math and science scores on

son for choosing engineering as
a major.

At the end of the College of En-
gineering’s 1984 freshman class
year, researchers looked at each
student's cumulative grade point
average, GPA in engineering
foundation courses such as math,
chemistry and physics and
whether the students were still
enrolledlin the college.

When everything was equal,
the researchers found that men
were likely to do better than
women.

”Take two identical students
with the same ability factors, the
same interests, the same motives
for coming, the same SATs —
they're all the same —— if you are
a male, our study indicates that
in engineering GPAS the males
will outperform the females by
.315,” said researcher James

Levin, academic adviser in the
Division of Undergraduate
Studies at Penn State.

Male students were also
predicted to do better in overall
GPAS by .18.

For two identical students, ”if
the female predicts a 3.0 [GPA],
the male would predict a 3.31 en-
gi_neering GPA and a 3.18 cu-
mulative,” Levin said. ’’In
engineering, at least for the sam-
ple we studied and the variables
we looked at, our statistics

_ predict that men would do better

than women.”

Levin and coresearcher John
Wyckoff, assistant director of Un-
dergraduate Studies, said they did
not have enough information to
fully explain the sex difference.

size that it was probably not

es because ‘the SATs are the
same, the achievement tests are
the same, the high school grade
pointlaverages are the same, so
the ability areas are held cons-
tant,” Levin said. ”We would
have to say it is more of an en-
vironmental, social type of
phenomenon.”

The researchers chose en-
gineering to see if they could
predict which students would
succeed because of the popular-
ity of the major.

Nationwide enrollments in en-
gineering have increased 70 per-
cent over the last 10 years, but
about half of those who enroll
drop out of the curriculum either
because they can't meet the
rigorous course demands or be-
cause they find they're not in-
terested, Levin said.

In addition to the sex differ-

’  

ences, the researchers also found
successful students had a narrow-
ly focused interest in related areas
.of math and science as opposed
to a broad range of interests, and
they had ”genuine motives” for
enrolling in the major, compared
to those who said they were seek-
ing big incomes and status.
They were also surprised by the
finding that high math scores on

freshmen placement exams were . ’_
better predictors of success than .

high SAT math scores, a tradition-
al engineering barometer.
SAT tests measure ability and

potential, but ’’ability and .

achievement are different,” Levin
said. -

The researchers said their find
ings, the first of what they hope
will be a four-year study tracking
the students, will help academic
advisers.

Prank causes damage

An apparent campus prank _

caused extensive damage to a
car parked in Schenley Quad
last night. A plastic bag full of
water was dropped from a

window in McCormick Hall .

and landed on the hood of a
car parked in front of the
building's entrance.

According to campus police
officer John Shamlin, the bag
of water was dropped from an
upper floor and caused exten-
sive damage to the car's hood.

At press time, neither the
owner of the-car nor the per-
son who dropped the bag had
been identified.

The car, a maroon Honda
Civic, was dented on the left
side of the hood, and the

frame of the left headlight had A

been knocked out.

The car had a Duquesne
University Sticker in the rear
window and bore the liscense
plate number DGN 483.

Witnesses said the bag was
probably dropped from a win-
dow on the ninth floor or
above.

University policy prohibits
dropping objects from the
windows of university
buildings.

gay bye-bye to Showcase

This may be the last Showcase you'll ever be able to throw down in disgust. Next
year, when our illustrious campus tabloid will publish four times a week, Showcase
will be left in the dusty and forgotten volumes of Pitt News relics.

No longer will people accustomed to mainstream culture be disoriented by arti-
cles found within the confines of this entertainment supplement. No longer will readers
be frightened by stories about Meat Puppets or The Butthole Surfers, and they won't
be pestered with admitted idol worship of R.E.M. or The Violent Femmes.

Showcase will be transformed into a shadow of its present form, to be squashed
in with the rest of the stories about Greek Week and the Pitt swim teams. it will be
awarded a generic title having to do with entertainment and uncomfortably sit some-
where in between the Perspective and Sports sections. '

I suppose that if hordes of enraged readers stormed the edit-orial office of The
Pitt News and logged a sit-in, then there would be a chance of bringing back Show-
case. But there's more than a good chance next fall that we will be reading in depth
about Studio Theater productions and Sly Stallone’s upcoming blockbusters, as well
as getting the scoop on what's happenning with Bi//board's hot lOO.

And it doesn't give me great comfort to be the last editor of Showcase. I guess
that says something about my feeble attempts to continue the tradition of non-
traditionalarticles.

I wish I had more space to sound like l’m whining. , . '

Han dm aiden ’s Tale

Author narrates with sincerity

THE HANDMAIDEN’S TALE
By Margaret Atwood
Ballantine Books

By James Crary

Margaret ATwood's The
Hana’maiden’s Ta/e is mar-
velous. Written in Germany
by an American woman,- This
work foresees a Terrible vi-
sion, a vision of a Fundamen-
talist America, with subtlety
and grace. IT is The Tone of The
work ThaT Truly moved This
reader.

The book is Told in first-
person, by a woman who has

achieved The status of hand-
maiden. Although she is care-
ful and chooses her words
when speaking To other
characters in The story, she
also manages To remain quite

‘True To herself.

She is aware of her com-
promises, and nothing she
reveals To The reader, but not
To The characters in The story,
gives her The Tone of duplici-
Ty. Her pained sincerity is The
most awesome element of The
work.

Naturally, she despises The
world she is forced To accept.
She remembers Times from
before The Turn, wisifully, as if

dreams from a half-world.

The Tone of The work is sub-
tle, graceful and stirring and,
although its vision is one of ur-
gency and alarm, The writer
is subdued and Taciturn.

Certainly one of The besT
books currently available, This
is as controversial as To K/'// a
Mockingbird or Night of The
Hunter, both of which con-
front similar American
prejudices.

Nevertheless, Atwood has
wriTTen a book of beauty and
depth that goes beyond The
subject maTTer and in a Tone
ThaT has grace and nuance.
Superb is her understatement.

Staying out of  
rigomarole's way

By James Crary

Kruxter is a band wiTh good
music and excellent prospects.
This is because They are off To an
early start. All of Them are in high
school. Straight-A students with
minds for detail, They never let
rigamarol stand in The way of
Their imaginations.

With fog—machines, spider-
belts and sharp lyrics, Kruxter
are nearly heavy—meTal kings.
They have Their own repeToire of
music. Weaned on Led Zeppe-
lin, Alice Cooper, Kiss and reg-
gae, This quartet bites inTo The
bullet with The impact of
hardened shamans.

Kruxter — whose debut con-
cert before an audience of 200_
credulous and cheering adoles-
cents was at a Methodist church
— has all The aspirations of a
band whose first album has
gone platinum and has The en-
thusiasm of genius.

Amidst adulating fans, it was
just possible To get an impromp-
Tu interview with The band, who
enjoyed The aTTenTion quite
shamelessly. The remarks were
hurried and insubstantial, so They
quickly passed me a phone num-
ber and disappeared behind
stage.

John Carson, The spokesman
for The band, gave me some in-
Tuition about The group.

”David [Lucarelli] and I start-
ed The band back at Reizenstein
Middle School. David had a gui-
Tar and wanted To play. He was
busy making films and writing
songs, and I decided That I
wanted To play. So my parents
bought me a bass. The—.band has
changed personnel occasional-
ly, but l Think we're a Tight acT
now."

When contemplating bands
who make an early start, one
Thinks of Michael Jackson, who
was singing love songs To a rat
at age T5. -

Of course, with fear of music
being all The rage in Parent-

- Teacher Association groups, The

possibility of wealth and super-
stardom may not always be
enough To persuade parents To
buy a guitar for little Joanna on
her next birthday.

Kruxter, however, does not
want To be iudged as early
bloomers. They listen To all The
records That would be censored
and come away with Their sense
of humor, and Their virtue, inTacT.
They're musicians, They want To
be iudged as musicians.

Coming soon to a wonderfully quaint establishment near
you: Billy Bragg,. The Mission and The Chesterfield Kings.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, April TO, 1987

from The Cure, ”Why Can't I Be You.” The B—side, ”A Japanese
Dream,” will not be on their upcoming LP.  J

Have you heard The Pee/ Sessions? They are l 2" EPs at select-
ed artists who have appeared on John Peel's BBC radio show. The
quality is tablulous, the song choices are impeccable and are sure
to be collector's items. Of special interest are The Gang of 4, The
Birthday Party, Stump and Joy Division EPs. Buy one — you'll want
them all!  Some British bands to watch tor: Chakk, Crazyhead,
Chumbawamba and Age of Chance (who've iust had a domestic
release with the single, "Kiss").  Look for Siouxsie Sioux in an
upcoming issue of Vogue. l guess there's no accounting for taste.
 Today is Brian Setzer's birthday. Drag out those Stray Cats
records and give ’em a listen.  Five Clash albums are now abail—
able on CD.  Why does the new Cult album sound like Led Zep
having sex with Foreigner? 

Another local band on vinyl — The Cynics’ B/ue Train Station. The
LP will be available for mass consumption next week.  Don't tar-
get Billy Bragg and The Mission at the end at the month.  Buy
it, borrow it or steal it — but be sure to hear the new Redd Kross
album, /\/eurotica. There's a tribute to Mackenzie Phillips among
other gems. 

There are obviously no literate local musicians. Here is a space
that reaches thousands of potential fans, and none of you oppressed
artists have sent me music, gossip, rude comments, letter bombs
or salutations. Just seeing a band's name in print creates some
familiarity (or at least curiosity). Have you heard these bands:
A.T.S., Special Ed, The Australian Cultural Terrorists, Bone of Con-
tention, The Iron Cheeseballs, The Heretics, The Crowflies, Fuch-
sia Blue, Johnny Rhythm and the Dimestore 45s, Half Life, The
White Outs, The Little Wretches, The Pep Boys or Carsickness? Are

you even a little curious?  See you at showsl!

The Mission U.K.

Puke buckets are iustonefacet of this British band

By Dave Zafris

The Mission's lead singer
_Wayne Hussey appreciates the
value of a well-positioned puke
pail.
"We have them strategically
placed on stage. The reason we
use sick—buckets is that it's bet-
ter to do it into a receptical.
When it gets on the stage, it's
very easy to slip on it and hurt
yourself.

"Also, it's much easier than
throwing up just anywhere. It's
like when you get up in the
morning, and you use a sort of

‘ automatic pilot to get to the toi-

let to expel what you drank the
night before."

Hussey's familiarity with
digestive disorders doesn't
originate from physical illness but

O'Neill takes leave of his

Josie Hogan sits in a bath of

loves in her arms. Come dawn,
she knows he'll leave — never to

with that. Coarse—mouthed

Josie is the only female

based on his brother Jamie;
The play takes place in l923

_ on a run-down farm in Connec-

ticut. During most of the first act,
Josie and her father, Phil, en-
gage in feisty dialogue dotted
with a dimly developed lrish-
Yankee politico—economic
theme. With club in hand, Josie
pits herself against her father's
drunken repartees.

As the play and the characters
develop, schemings and con-

James, their landlord.

discloses the truth about herself
to James, she lacks the neces-
sary tone and feeling to convey
the poignancy of the moment.

But the sorrow and peace in
her eyes as she cradles the
sleeping James held the au-
dience spellbound.

James Bond rendered a lack-
luster performance as Tyrone —
the tortured soul in search of for-
giveness never rose above the
words.

 

Although David Doepken '‘

gave a droll performance as
Josie's father, his physical ap-
pearance made him less con-
vincing. -_
Harry Bouvie, a Pitt sopho-
more, played the minor role of
Mike Hogan, Josie's brother.
He appeared briefly at the be-
ginning of the play;.his interac-
tion with Josie served as an
introduction to her character.
Ed Cain was cast as Yankee
Harder, whose farm adjoins the
Hogan's. Cain's plaid suit
provided the only comic relief
during Phil and Josie's humiliat-
ing badgering — Harder’s.reac—
tion to the absurd accusations
was too wooden to add much.
Director Richard Keitel needs

to slow down the performances

somewhat. They were too '
rushed, especially the dialogue ’
between Josie and her father. E
For Keitel, the staging of Moon .

serves as his MFA directing the-
sis. Also, Harfenist and Bond are
performing their roles for their
MFA.

Quarterback situation s

 

horsll lohP_iﬁ Nvvs

Joe Felitsky (left) and Sal_ Genilla (right) are both front-runners for the quarterback position
right now, but things could change during the upcoming season.‘

By Jim Urban
Editor—in—Chief

What are the characteristics of

a Pitt quarterback?

The answer you will get de-
pends on whom you ask.

If you question a female resi-
dent of Brackenridge Hall, she
might say, ”Tall, dark hair,
dreamy eyes, broad shoulders
and a cute smile."

If you ask a Pitt football fanat-
ic, he might say, ”Good leader,
very intelligent, with good athlet-
ic ability.”

But looking back through the

1 years, there is one characteristic

that stands out — durability and
staying power. ‘

Look at several of the recent
Pitt quarterbacks. They broke into
the starting lineup at young ages

and somehow became institu— -

tions. At least, somewhat.
°John Congemi, a four—year

starter, is Pitt's second all—time

leading passer with 6,467 yards.

0 Dan Marino, another four-
year starter, is Pitt's all—time lead-
ing passer with 8,597 total pass-
ing yards.

0 Rick Trocano, a three-year
starter, is Pitt's third all-time lead-
ing passer with 4,219 yards.

0 Matt Cavanaugh, another
three-year starter, is fifth on the
all—time passing list with 3,378
yards. 1
" That's what makes this year's
quarterback situation so peculiar.

Two players — seniors Joe
Felitsky and Sal Genilla —- will
battle for the position. And when

Friday, April l0, 1987

/

till up in theair

both are done with their Pitt
careers at the end of the season,
you probably will not see either
of their names among those of
their predecessors in the Pitt
record books. _

In his career, Felitsky, a 6-3,
200—pound graduate of Pittsburgh
Central Catholic, has thrown the
ball 86 times, completing 41: for
458 yards and one touchdown.
He has ‘been intercepted six
times.

Genilla has thrown the ball 21
times, completing eight for 105
yards. He has been intercepted
three times.

Neither player offers staggering
figures. _

Basically, whoever wins the
job will be filling a void until a
younger player, such as redshirt
freshman Larry Wanke or incom-
ing freshman Darnell Dickerson,
is ready to step in and start. ”

”That’s_ the problem with tran-,
sition,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said on Thursday. ”One of the
things you would like to have is
somebody who can take the.
quarterback job for three or four
years.

”_Last year, John [Congemi] V
handled it, and someone will
take it this year. But we’ll be look-
ing for someone again next‘ sea-
son. It's a situation that you can’t;_._
control.” _ ._ 3'

So right now, Gottfried is con-2:1
centrating on preparing for the" .-

fall. He has Genilla, Felitsky and 1 : ' 

Wanke working extensively in_
game situations during spring”
Please see Passers, page 18'

 

senior from San Mateo, Calif.,
Genilla has the early lead in
the quarterback derby ac-
cording to Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried. ’

Genilla was originally sup-

season,’ but an injury to start-
er lohn Congemi forced him
into action against Miami.

He has been getting the
most time running with the

' first-team offense of all the

candidates. V .
Strengths: arm, athletic
abilities, mobility. _
pweaknesses: leadership
qualities, NCAA experience,
ability to handle a rush. ,-

Sal Genilla: 2-1 odds. — A

posed to be redshirted last.

Ioe Felitsky: 3-1 odds —
Felitsky is GenilIa’s main com-
petition. Also a senior, Felit-
sky played two good games
late in the season last year.

If the quarterback job ‘was
determined by who’ was the
best looking, Felitsky would
have the position locked up.

Felitsky has_the edge in arm
strength, and he revealed that '
he was an adequate leader
against Rutgers and Penn
State.

Strengths: very strong arm,
somewhat mobile, adequate
leader. '

Weaknesses: tends to panic
under a strong rush, some-
times throws into ‘double-
coverage. V -

Who canitbe now?     g   
Odn favorites to fill the positioncome the fall

Larry Wanke: 10-1 Odds
— Wanke is a redshirt fresh-
man from Cleveland, Oh. He

is Pitt's quarterback of the fu- .
ture. It is only a matter of,‘

time before Wanke begins his
assault on the Pitt passing
records. The "only thing he
lacks is experience. The phys-
ical ability is there.

Wanke is progressing slow-
ly, and Gottfried expects him
to do better during the second
half of spring drills.

Wanke is a sleeper this year,
but he will be the favorite the
following year.

Strengths: youth, arm, mo-
bility. ‘ ‘

’ .Weakness: inexperience

 

Pat Cavanaugh: 5000-1
odds — Cavanaugh was a
walk-on quarterback for the
Panthers last year, but the
best passes he‘ completed
were on the basketball court.

Ca vanaugh has been award-
ed a full-scholarship by Pitt
basketball coach Paul Evans,
so he'll no longer spend his
fall afternoons with the scout
team on the field at Pitt

_Stadium. '

_ Strengths: sees the court
well, can get the ball inside to

P Smith and lane.

Weaknesses: can ’t go to his
left, is a liablilty on defense,
does not handle full-court
pressure well.

  

g -

”Spec” Ellison: 20,000-1
odds — The only passes
”Spec” made last fall were on .
a September Friday night in»
Zelda's. ’

f’Spec” is the -man who ‘ - 
keeps the Pitt- football team ' 
organized. The problem. is _  
that he never gets any public- 1 . a = 1
ity. He is always overlooked.

While he probably will. not  ' P
quarterback the Panthers in

the annual spring game at Pitt
Stadium.

”We are scrimmaging more
now than I have ever scrimmaged
before, anywhere I have been,”
Gottfried said.

He stated that he is looking for
a quarterback who has the phys-
ical abilities to get the job done
but also the leadership qualities
to take charge of the team.

The frontrunner at this point
seems to be Genilla, the 6-2,

”Sal Genilla is probably play-
ing No. 1 right now at quarter-
back,” Gottfried admitted. ”He’s
doing a little bit better at running
the offense effectively.”

But Felitsky may not be that far
behind. His career seemed head-
ed for nowhere at one point, but
he salvaged it last season by vir-
tue of his strong showings against
Rutgers and Penn State.

Gottfried said that the two will

 

continue to battle it out through ,.-

spring drills and into fall camp at
Pitt-lohnstown. Wanke, a 6-2,
l95—pound native of Cleveland,
is progressing, but he is young
and still learning, Gottfried
added.

Going into the fall, Felitsky
may have one advantage in the
fact that he has some limited ex-
perience. .

”l think I have been in every

situation before that I could pos— A

sibly be in,” Felitsky said. ”Ob-
viously, the position I enjoy the
-most is starting quarterback. That
is every quarterback’s dream.

But the battle for starting quar-
terback will not turn into a war
either, Felitsky said.

”We all have a very good rela-
tionship with each other. If one
guy makes a mistake or a bad
play, you are not going to see the
other guy cheering,” he said.

In the end, the players are con-
fident that the right selection will
be made.

”[The coaches] are not going to
have a guy sitting on the bench
who is better than the guy who
is playing,” Felitsky said.

Cowboys’

kicker

charged in
sex crime

DENTON, Texas (AP) — Dallas
Cowboys kicker Rafael Septien
pleaded guilty to indecency with

a child Wednesday in a plea bar— '

gain agreement, authorities ‘said.

Septien madethe plea in an
agreement for a sentence of 10
years deferred probation and a
$2,000 fine.

”The matter has been resolved
by the court and he's still a mem-
ber of the football team,” Cow-
boys President and General
Manager Tex Schramm said.

Septien, 33, was indicted Jan.
22 in the sexual assault of a
10-year-old friend of his room-
mate’s daughter. He originally
pleaded innocent to the charge.

”The court has made its ruling
and, hopefully, the matter is now
closed,’’ said Cowboys coach
Tom Landry in a statement.

Septien entered the guilty plea
before State District Judge John
Narsutis. The first year of Sep-
tien’s sentence would be under
intense supervision. Under
deferred probation, if Septien fol-
lows the terms of his sentence, it
will not go on his record as a con-
viction. '

’’I am‘ relieved that this matter
has been resolved in the best in-
terests of all parties,” said Sep-
tien. ’’I am looking forward to
making a positive contribution to
the Cowboys and the com-
munity.”

The only evidence presented
by Assistant District Attorney Lee
Gabriel was a signed confession
by Septien. ’

Gabriel said during the hearing
Wednesday morning that the vic-
tim's family told lawyers for both
sides it was ”their desire to dis-
solve the case in this manner.”

Septien, as part of the terms of
his probation, was ordered to
avoid alcoholic beverages and
notify the probation office the first
and third Tuesday of each month,
beginning'April 14.

”Buddy [Morris] has been
working us real hard,” said
Stewart. ”We weren't happy with
the last three seasons, and we are
going to change that this year. I
can tell from the work we have
done over the winter that this
team wants to win."

Stewart, a junior from Non/valk,
Ohio, hails from the same
hometown from which Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried once
coached high school football.

”| get along with Coach Gott-
fried very well,” said Stewart.
”He has made an immediate im-
pact on our team. I have never
seen anyone who has a greater
urge to win than Coach Gottfried.
He is obsessed, and that kind of
attitude is rubbing off on the

Stewart has played all four

years at Pitt but saw a little action

at tight end last season. His 6-5

size and quick speed makes him

an ideal target. Last year, Stewart
was third on the team,Awith 28

14.0 average.

”Mike has really asserted him-
self as a leader in the off-season
conditioning,” said receiver
coach Steve Coury. ”He seems to
have taken over the group, and

The Panthers’ conditioning

was Coach Gottfried’s first season

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, April 10, 1987

Evans signs another great recruit in Bobby Martin 1

By John Enright

Sports Editor

When Paul Evans came to Pitt
one year ago from the Naval
Academy, one of the few ques-
tions that remained about his
coaching was his ability to recruit
players on the major-colleg
level. V '

One year later, Evans has
proved to be more than adequate

I in the recruiting process, inking

five players for next season who

- are considered among the top

100 players in the nation.

The last of the five to sign may
have been the most important.
Bobby Martin, a 6-9 power‘ for-
ward from Atlantic City High
School in New Jersey, signed a
binding letter-of.-intent with the
Panthers on Wednesday.

’’I’m happy with Pitt, and that's
it,” said Martin, who was recruit-
ed intensely by Pitt and Vil-
lanova.

Martin told Villanova in De-
cember that he would play there
and changed his mind in
February.

”He’s the one putting in‘ four

Verbal agreements

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

After an entire season of losing,
but ”trying to find the right com-
bination,” Lady Panther basket-
ball coach Kirk Bruce just may
have done it.

Yesterday, junior college stand-
outs Diedra Baker and Denise
Becher both announced that they
are definitely signing with Pitt.

was born out ofa cacophony

Both Baker and Becher have
played for Hilbertlunior College
in Hamburg, N.Y., for the past
two seasons. Under their com-
bined 34 points per game (17 ppg
each), Hilbert has posted a 57-4
overall record during the two
years. .

According to Lady Panther as-
sistant coach Kim Basick, Bruce
first saw Baker at the National
Junior College Association tour-

years. He has to be happy with
his decision,” said Bill DiVinny,
Martin's high school coach.

Pitt coach Paul Evans wasn't
available for comment.

Martin averaged 22 points, 12
rebounds and three blocked shots
a game this season. He led Atlan-
tic City to an 18-8 record and the
state playoffs where Atlantic City
was eliminated in the third
round.

Pitt's other recruits are: Darelle
Porter (6-4 guard from Perry
Traditional Academy in Pitts-
burgh), Sean Miller (6-1 guard

from Blackhawk High School in
Beaver Falls), Jason Matthews
(6-3 guard from Santa Monica,
Calif.) and Brian Shorter (6-7 for-
ward from Oak Hill Academy in
Mouth of Wilson, Va.).

All players with the exception
of Shorter have passed the re-
quirements of Proposition 48 —
the eligibility guidelines for col-
lege freshman.

Because Shorter, a Parade All-
American, is a fon/vard and hasn't
cleared the SAT portion-of Propo-
sition 48, Martin's signing is even
more crucial because of the Pan-

thers’ lack of depth on the front,.....,

line. .

Shorter was scheduled to take
the SAT again last Saturday at
Central Catholic High School.

Pitt's only returning dependa-
ble big men will be forwards Jer-
ome Lane and Rod Brookin,
along with center Charles Smith
— possibly.

Smith is still debating whether

he will enter June's NBA draft._,....

Martin, who was also named to
this year's Parade All-America
team, will be playing with Short-

made with Lady Panthers

nament two years ago.

”We’ve been working on these
two for a long time,” said Basick.
”We had a verbal agreement
from Diedra on Jan. 18. Now
we're just waiting for the word
from New York.”

While averaging 17 points and
seven rebounds per game, Baker
was named NJCA All-America
and NJCA region three player
ofthe year.

Becher said, ”I got lucky.
When they were looking at films
of Diedra, I guess I just caught
somebody’s eye.”

Perhaps she shouldn't be so

modest. With this past season's -

loss of Valerie Halesworth and
the inexperience of Karen
Threatt, Becher's.17 points, five
assists and three steals pergame
make her a welcomed addition at
point guard.

    Our Constitution

“We play really well together,”
commented Becher. ’-‘I didn't de-
cide to go to Pitt because she was

going there, it just worked out_4--J

that way.”

Baker agrees, ”The main rea-
son I decided to go [to Pitt] was
because I felt comfortable. The

people were really friendly, and _

I heard the coaches there could
help me a lot.”

Pirates still unable to take 1986
World Series champs, lose 4-2

By Ben Walker
AP Baseball Writer

NEW YORK — Darryl Straw-
berry, with a new attitude and a
new pair of pants, is looking like
the player that all his critics said
he would never be.

”|t’s time to show what Darryl
Strawberry can do,” he said after
his home run and double Thurs-
day helped the New York Mets

beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-2. B

Strawberry homered deep into
the right field seats in the second
inning and led off the seventh
with a double, later scoring on
Howard Johnson's sacrifice fly to
break a 2-2 tie. Strawberry also
homered Tuesday, making him
the first Mets’ player to hit home
runs in the team's first two games
of the season.

’’I’m concentrating well. I'm
not being fooled up there,”
Strawberry said. ’’I’m determined
to perform well this year.”

Strawberry has averaged 26
home runs and 85 runs batted in
per season since joining the Mets,
but he has always been criticized
— including by Manager Davey
Johnson — for poor work habits
and lack of dedication.

But, after his close friend and
teammate Dwight Gooden en-

tered drug rehabilitation last
week for cocaine use, Strawber-
ry was especially stung by rumors
that he had led Gooden astray.

”That really hurt,” said Straw-
berry, who is wearing Gooden’s
uniform pants in tribute to his ab-
sent friend. ”|’ve got a lot of anger
in me. I'm angry at everybody, at
the world.”

“I feel I've had some good
years, and I'm determined to do
better. My work habits are a lot
better,” said Strawberry, who
spent 15 minutes exercising after
the victory as part of a new post-
game routine.

Strawberry’s manager, while
pointing out the season is only
two games old, said he has no-
ticed a difference. ”He looks very
confident, very determined,”
Johnson said. ”lt’s scary how
hard he's hit the ball.”

The win gave the Mets a sweep
of their two-game, season-
opening series with Pittsburgh, a
team they beat 1 7 of 18 times last
season — including all nine at
Shea Stadium.

Strawberry and Kevin McRey—
nolds hit consecutive home runs
leading off the second inning
against Doug Drabek.

Strawberry, who hit a three—run
homer on opening day, sent a 1-0

pitch deep into the right field
seats. Two pitches later, McRey—
nolds connected for his first hit
since being acquired in an off-
season trade from San Diego._

Drabek then retired the next 13
batters and allowed just three hits
in six innings.

Leading off the seventh, Straw-
berry doubled off reliever Logan
Easley, O-1, moved to third on
McReynolds’ groundout and trot-
ted home on Johnson's sacrifice
fly to right.

Gary Carter's RBI single in the
eighth, his 1,000th career RBI,
gave the Mets their final run_.

Ron Darling held Pittsburgh
hitless for 3 2-3 innings and
pitched out of constant trouble
until the seventh. Rafael Belliard
opened the inning with an infield
single and took third when pinch-
hitter R.J. Reynolds followed with
a double. Barry Bonds hit a
sacrifice fly and Andy Van Slyke
greeted Gene Walter with a dou-
ble that made it 2-2.

Walter, also obtained in the
McReynolds deal, wound up
winning his first decision with the
Mets. Jesse Orosco worked the fi-
nal two innings, striking out the
side in the ninth, for his second
save.
