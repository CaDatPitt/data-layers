Task Force steps up action in area rape cases

By Pete Brasko Ill

Contributing Editor

Pittsburgh police have formed
a 14 member task force to search
for a Swissvale man suspected in
a series of Oakland rapes, saying
"they have few clues of his where-
abouts.

”He could be anywhere,” said
Commander Ronald Freeman.

The suspect, 28-year-old Tho-
mas Croom Jr., of Woodstock
Avenue, is described as alight-
skinned black male, 5 feet 10

' inches tall, weighing 225
pounds, with a beard and a small
mustache.

The task force consists of four
sex assault squad detectives, two
homicide detectives, two auto

clothes detectives from the Squir-
rel Hill Zone.

Croom slipped through a
police dragnet Monday in the
heavily wooded area between
the Parkway and Squirrel Hill, af-
ter allegedly raping a Squirrel Hill
girl early Monday morning and
attempting to rape two women in
Oakland.

”He was just lucky to get
away,” Freeman said of the
search that involved dozens of
city policemen, several state
troopers, and a he|icopter.”lt was
a difficult area to search.”

According to police reports, the
latest attacks-began around Mid-
night Sunday, when a man at-

”It’s been two and a half
months," and during that time
there's been no contact with Joe

until just about over a week ago.” ~

Gongaware confirmed that the
Angolan government permitted
Italian officials to see Longo.

They reported that Longo was in -

good condition both physically
and mentally. J
”Prior to that time when the

Italians saw him, no one but the

_ Angolans had seen him,” Gonga-

._ said. ”|t’s a great relief.”

I Gon-gaware and Longo’s other
two sisters, brother and parents
have restlessly waited since April
for any word of Longo’s release

, from Angola. ”My father and

\ Joe's girlfriend and I went "down

to Washington, D.C. and spoke

‘a to a number of officials. We were

 also involved in a letter-writing
Q '’~ campaign," Gongaware said.

Gongaware said she is grateful

' to the University of Pittsburgh's’

Student Government Board for
suppporting the letter-writing

ware said. ’’That was very
stressful.”

She said the family plans to

have a party for her brother, but
not right away. “He'll need a lot
of rest first,” she said. ”And we'll
make sure he gets a good meal.”

Longo was held captive in An-
golaisince late April when Ango-
lans forced down the plane he
was ferrying. _

According to a recent article in
the Pittsburgh Press, Rep. John P.
Murtha (D-Johnstown) and
Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.) the
chairman of the House Subcom-
mittee on African Affairs, dis-
cussed Longo’s situation and then
met with a high-level delegation
from Angola at which time an
agreement was reached for Lon-
go’s release-.

Longo arrived, at Andrews Air ”

day night and from there was
flown to the Westmoreland
County Airport in Latrobe where
he arrived at about 10:30 p.m.

the woman began
screaming.

Then, just 30 minutes later, a
woman walking on Dimling Way
was jumped,by a man who start-
ed to rip her clothes off.

But her screams aroused neigh-
bors, and he fled with her purse.

Just two hours later, a 15-year-
old Squirrel Hill girl wasn't as for-

_ tunate.

Police say the girl was walking
home on Bennington Avenue
around 2:30 a.m., when a man
dragged her into a yard and raped
her.

Police said the rapist left his

reports, and noticed a car speed-

The officers gavechase, and
found the car abandoned a short
time later near the Bloomfield
bridge. Police said they found the
purse of the woman who had
been attacked earlier sitting on
the front seat.

Witnesses reported seeing a
man fitting a description of the
rapist — dressed only in a tee-

Government widens its investigation of PTL

COLUMBIA, S.C. — The U.S.
Justice Department is escalating
its investigation of the PTL tele-
vision ministry and its exiled
founderlim Bakker, and will im-
panel a special grand jury to hear
fraud allegations, a source said
Tuesday.

Federal officials decided take
such actions because of the large
number of allegations about the
PTL under Bakker and questions
about the ministry's tax-exempt
status, the Justice Department
source said, speaking on condi-
tion of anonymity. .

The allegations include income
tax fraud, wire fraud and mail
fraud, the source-said.

'The evidence compiled by tax
attorneys with the Justice Depart-
ment will be presented in Colum-
bia, the source said. But it was
not known what charges would
be presented to the special grand
jury or when the panel would
meet.

CNN reported Tuesday that the ‘

criminal investigation of PTL’s
former management involves
possible tax evasion from 1984 to

1986.

”We welcome any inquiry into
the Bakkers’ tax circumstances,"
Melvin Belli, an attorney for Bak-
ker and his wife, Tammy Faye,
told CNN.

Confusion over SGB— fraternity mailing resolved  

By Teresa Candori
Managing Editor

The use of university mailing
privileges by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity through
the Student _Government Board
has caused confusion within the
Greek community over the legal-
ity of such actions.

Members of several sororities
received invitations to a June 20
party hosted by the Delta Tau

‘ Delta fraternity. The invitations‘

received by at least one sorority
were mailed in University of Pitts-
burgh envelopes bearing the
mailing stamp of the Student
Government Board and an
18-cent bulk rate postal cancel-
Iation.

Concerned that the invitations

might qualify as a violation of In-
terfraternity Council advertising
policy, a student, who asked not
to be identified, contacted Greek
advisor Bridget Guernsey.

The student, a member of ..

another fraternity, stressed that he
acted independently and not as
a representative of his fraternity.

He also expressed a concern
voiced by several other students
that Delta Tau Delta had made
use of university mailingin lieu
of paying for postage.

Such was not the case, accord-
ing to Student Government Board

President Phil Moyer, who is also «

a Delta Tau Delta brother. A
check in the amount of $1 2.1 O to
cover the postage cost was issued
by Delta Tau Delta to‘ Student
Government approximately a

week after the invitations, post-
marked May'30, were sent.

Moyer reported receiving the
check, dated June 8, on June 9.

‘The Delta Tau Delta brothers
who planned the party ap-
proached Moyer with the idea of
mailing the invitations through
the Student Government Office
in order to get the invitations out
sooner.

”They wanted the invitations
out Friday, and the post office
was closed,” said Luke Kluchko,
a Delt brother and graduate stu-
dent employed in the Office of
Student Activites. ”When I was
asked if -there would be a
problem [with mailing through
the Student Government Office],
I said no,” he said.

Though the envelopes bore an

I8—cent bulk rate cancellation,
the fraternity paid the full 22-cent
rate for each envelope. The
university mailroom charges stu-
dent organizations a four-cent
handling fee for bulk mailings,
according to Joyce Giangarlo, as-

sistant director of Student Activi-

ties and Student Government
advisor. ‘

Giangarlo said both she and
Director of Student Activities
Joseph Cavalla spoke with Moy-
er about the incident, calling it
poor judgement on Moyer’s part
and urging him to be more cau-
tious in the future.

"It was a bad judgement call
on my part,” Moyer said,
”though no money actually was
taken from Student Activities."

In a letter responding to the stu-

dent concerned about possible
violations, Guernsey indicated
that she had seen a copy of the
check issued by the Delts to the
Student Government, and that
she had spoken to Moyer about
the incident.

According to Guernsey, the in-

vitations did not represent an ads '

violation. The Office of Student
Activites has no policy about ad-
vertising for parties; Interfraterni-
ty Council: policy prohibits
advertising in The Pitt News us-
ing the words ”party” or
’’alcohol.’’

Fraternities can, through the
Office of Student Activities, ar-
range bulk mailings to incoming
freshmen, but there is no provi-
sion for fraternities to use univer-
sity mailing for invitations.

(AP) — Angola's desire for
better relations with the Unit-
ed States was apparent in the
Communist nation's release of
a Pennsylvania man whose
plane strayed over the African
nation, an aid to Sen. Arlen
Specter said Tuesday.

”They wanted to underscore
, that this was  an opportuni-
' ty for serious discussions [with
the U.S. ambassador for Afri-
ca],” said Cordon Woodrow.
”They also underscored
their concern about further
trade sanctions or anything
that would further disrupt their
economy, which is in sham-
bles,” said Woodrow, who
represented Specter when a
U.S. delegation visited Ango-
la for the release of Joseph

Tradition dominates ’4th’

celebrations in Pittsburgh 4“

By Neata Nicholas
For The Pitt News

This year not only marks the
University of Pittsburgh's bicen-
tennial, but it was also two cen-
turies ago that the Constitution of
the United States was ratified.
Officially, the Constitution was

/ ratified on Sept. 17, 1787 in Con-

necncut

Most students will spend their
‘Fourth of.July, the holiday that
celebrates the United States offi-
cial declaration of independence,
in the traditional way — watch-
ing parades, picnicking with their
families and enjoying fireworks
displays.

Kim Holloman, a student em-
ployee at the Bevier Engineering
Library, said ”Although we
celebrate the Fourth of July by
cooking out, picnicking and

watching fireworks, most people 3

take ideals such as independence

~ and freedom for granted in that

we never give these issues much

attitudes would be different con-
cerning the basic freedoms we
are able to practice in the Unit-

Most students, it seems, do ap-
preciate the premise behind the
celebration.

”The constitution gives us the
right to say and do what we want,
within the law, of course. I will
celebrate by having a picnic with
my family and watchingthe fire-
works,” said an engineering
student.

Rapists play control game — and victim is loser

It was just after midnight, early Tuesday
morning, and I had to walk home alone.
I didn't have to, but there was no good
reason why I shouldn't. I enjoy walking
most of the time.

There was lightening, but it was as if the
rain had paused just long enough for me
to get home before it resumed. Perhaps

- Mother Nature is fair after all. I only get
drenched half the time when it is raining.
The other half, I'm lucky enough to es-
cape with a few nicks from storm shrap-
ne|.' (That's what I call water that has
formed a big puddle in the shoulder of
a street. Mix with mud, rocks and other
slimy things, then add a big truck with a
vengeance to soak — that's it. The water
that hits you once it's spun off of those
big Chevy truck tires at 65 miles an hour
is storm shrapnel: Wet, stingy and cold.
Yuck.) '

I had been following.the rape stories in
the news, and though I tried to convince
myself it was perfectly safe, that nothing
was going to happen, I kept thinking
about those stories. I really fought with
myself. But I simply couldn't shake such

_ thoughts. _

When I took a shortcut through a park-
ing lot, I encountered the only person
who even came close to crossing my
path, and I kept watching him out of the
corner of my eye.

I hate worrying about a rapist. Of
course, there is a thin line between ob-
session and concern, and I readily dis-
missed my thoughts as healthy concern.

I have lived in Oakland for just over a
year. I had heard aboutand seen on tele-
vision the horrible crimes that have been
committed here, at a time when I lived
in a town that's only serious crime was
not having a movie theater.

Sometimes, I would take evening
walks, alone, on the weekend. I didn't
feel like anyone had the right to make me
afraid. I could walk where I wanted to,
when I wanted to, and as long as I didn't
bother anyone else, nobody was going to
bother me.

The corner of Bouquet and Forbes has
always been a challenge. At times, I am
resentful of the people who make that
area of Oakland an unpleasant spot on

weekend nights. ,

One evening, I was walking home from
thelibrary. I think it was a Thursday. A
man started talking to me, I ignored him,
but he kept following me. I was more than
nervous. But I couldn't let him see that.
I thought that if I kept ignoring him, he
would resign himself.

He didn't. He followed me to the corn-
er of the street where I lived and grabbed
my arm. Fortunately, people were com-
ing out of a local establishment distract-
ed him, so I shook him off and ran away.
I'm surprised he didn't come after me
with a knife. '

HARRISBURG — Finding a
compromise on legislation to re-
tain the Liquor Control Board was
the General Assembly's problem,
but changes in the new law be-

came the headache of the board

and state police Tuesday.

While the law, signed Monday,

doesn't make many substantial

‘I changes to the liquor monopoly,
it does shift enforcement_of the li-
quor laws to the state police and
affects how liquor stores do
business.

Former LCB chiefcounsel Gary
DiVito said he foresees problems
during the transition period over
the next few weeks.

’.’I see this transition period as
being an absolute morass of
problems,” said DiVito, who
now is in private legal practice
specializing in the liquor code. ”I
should make a lot of money.

”It’s such a mess,” he said. ”I
can't believe they actually passed

"it. I looked at this bill and said
’Cood grief, I don't know what is
solved."”

Many of the problems are high-

 ly technical and mainly affect

those who operate bars or other
establishments licensed to sell
liquor, DiVito said.

The state police must figure out
how to transfer LCB enforcement
agents to the force, but spokes-
man Tom Lyon said it -’’will take
some time” to complete the
move. ‘

”It’s an administrative transfer
to the control of the state police,”
said Lyon. ”The bottom line now
is that they work’ for the state

police. '

’’[It will be] the same people

doing the same job, but they will ’

be assigned to us,” he said.

V There are no plans on who will
be supervising the unit or for
training of future workers, said

‘Lyon, noting it will be manned by

civilian workers, not troopers.

DiVito said the legislation is
unclear on how many of the cur-
rent LCB agents would be al-
lowed to seek new jobs in the
board's licensing unit, forcing the
state police to hire new em-
ployees. .

LCB Chairman Daniel Pennick
also said the board ”has some
problems with enforcement.

”But we're working on it, and
hopefully, it will be resolved,”
Pennick said. ”We can't imple-
ment it tomorrow.” . ‘

Little will change in state liquor

stores, but they will be able to

have more flexible operating
hours and accept credit cards for
customer purchases.

our photographers said that while he was
out shooting photos, he saw the police
questioning a man who fit several criter-

ia in the description of the rapist the ‘

police are currently searching for. (Hope-
fully, by the time you read this, they will
have found him.) But the photographer
said he saw the police let the man go be-
cause he did not completely fit the
description.

There is nothing more disgusting than
a rapist. I have read many articles on the
subject, and from what I understand, it is
not the ”getting off” part they really
desire. It's the control. Every woman -is a
conquest. Every rape is an ego trip.

I try to imagine how I would act if I -

were to be raped. Would I_be ashamed?

It seems that it would be difficult not to I

be. If you were raped, the most personal

of all your belongings — your body 5 i

would be assaulted.

I have never known -a rapevictim. I feel A .

rape is more heinous a crime than murd-
er. -

Democraticelections are on horizon in Seoul

SEOUL, South Korea — Presi-
dent Chun Doo—hwan was ex-
pected to announce Wednesday
that his government will put into
effect the democratic reforms he
rejected before nationwide pro-

tests began June 10.

- The former army general was
to address the nation on televi-
sion. Officials said he would
agree to a direct election to
choose his successor, in place of
the present electoral college sys-
tem, and other reforms the oppo-
sition demands. -

Security forces were ordered
off maximum alert Tuesday ‘for
the first time since protests began
three weeks ago aimed at ousting

Chun’s authoritarian government.

Riot police withdrew or took
up .posts in back streets.

Newspaper and television reports
showed smiling officers packing
up gear or relaxing in.the sun.
- Chun met on Tuesday with
Roh Tae-woo, head of the
governing Democratic Justice
Party, who startled the nation the
day before by demanding that
Chun accept the reforms and end

the unrest.

Officials said Chun met with

his cabinet and advisers" later
Tuesday and ordered them to
start work on implementing-key
reforms including release of po-
litical detainees, restoring press
freedom and granting autonomy
to local governments.

Soviet judiciary paves
way for liberalization

MOSCOW -— The Supreme
Soviet passed laws Tuesday
designed to reform the economy
and to lay the legal groundwork
for Mikhail. S; Gorbachev’s liber-
alization plans.

With ‘a unanimous show of

hands, the 1,500 deputies of the

Supreme Soviet passed three laws
the Communist Party Central
Committee endorsed at its semi-
annual meeting last week.’ -
The Supreme Soviet is the na—
tion's nominal parliament and its

passage of the laws was a for-

mality.

- , One measure is the keystone of

an economic reform plan .to_
reshape industry by giving more
power and responsibility to local

managers and restricting the role
of bureaucrats based in Moscow.
Factories and other enterprises
will be expected to make a profit.
They also will be allowed to set
some prices and fix production
plans on the basis of guidelines
issued in Moscow. I

. The other laws adopted on the I

final day of the Supreme Soviet’s
two-‘day summer session imple-
ment clauses of the 1977 Soviet

constitution that provide for na— _
' tional discussion of important

government decisions and court

"redress for abuse of power by

officials. .

All the legislation is linked to
campaigns begun by Gorbachev
after he became Communist

Party ch-ief in March 1985 for in-

creased labor efficiency and dis-
cipline, official accountability
and,wider citizen participation in
decisions.

President Andrei A. Gromyko
told the deputies- in the Grand
Kremlin Palace that the reforms

mus_t be implemented quickly be-
cause ”the party and people are
now racing against time. The
whole world is waiting for the
outcome of this race.”

Eleven more economic reform
measures are expected to be ap-
proved before year's end. Among
subjects they cover are pricing,
supply, planning, banking and
credit. '

German WWII bomb
gives London ascare

LONDON —— Police emptied ‘

the streets, evacuated apartments
and closed pubs in London on
Monday. More than 500 people
took shelter in community halls
where soup kitchens and beds
were set up hurriedly. Am-
bulances and fire engines stood
by.

London held its breath for more
than 30 hours until late Tuesday
afternoon while army experts de-
fused a World War II bomb
dropped by the German Luft-
waffe near Tower Bridge and bu-
ried under 21 feet of dirt near the
banks of‘ the River Thames;

It was a scene out of the Nazi
Blitz.

But this was 1987, not 1940-41
when the German war machine
rained hundreds of thousands of
bombs on London to soften the
British capital for an invasion that
never happened.

Construction foreman Michael
Killeen said he thought his wor-
kers had hit a cast iron pipe at
about noon Monday while using
a pile driver on a construction site

where abandoned Victorian‘

warehousesare being converted
into apartments in the massive ur-
ban program in southeast Lon-
don’s Docklands area.

”We picked it up and then let
it drop. It was only then we real-
ized it looked like a bomb and

‘called the police,” he said.

”Thank goodness I didn't break

.it or we would all have been

goners.” '

it was actually a 2,200-pound

_ device, one of the largest the Ger-
mans dropped over Britain during‘

the blitz which killed more than

.15,000 Londoners and damaged

or destroyed 3.5 million houses.

two years by the Angolans.

”We know he could have

We're very fortunate that this

father, Bernard.»

Longo was forced by fighter
planes to crash land April 21
while flying over Angolan ter-
ritory.

slight problem with the
plane,” Woodrow said. ”He
was having some problems

. with his fuel, so he was trying,

to trim his flight path as lean
as possible in miles, and he
strayed over/’,

The senator's aide said there
was no hint that Longo was
spying as the Angolans at first
alleged. -

’’I am thoroughly convinced
that this fella is, as he called
himself, a driver of planes, and
that is all,” he said.

Woodrow said he did not
learn what happened to the
Beechcraft plane Longo had
been hired by Pilot Interna-
tional in Wichita, Kan., to

WASHINGTON —— The gov-
ernment said Tuesday its main
economic forecasting gauge post-
ed a fourth consecutive monthly
increase in May, a 0.7 percent ad-
vance that the Reagan administra-
tion hailed as evidence the
long-running recovery is not
wearing out.

The Commerce Department's
Index of Leading Indicators post-
ed its best gain since a 0.9 per-
cent rise in March. Additionally,

, the government revised the April

figure to show a small 0.2 percent
rise instead of what originally had
been reported as a steep 0.6 per-
cent drop.

Administration officials said thel
combination of the May increase:
and the April revision offered fur-
ther proof that the recovery from !
the 1981-82 recession, already'
the second longest peacetime ex-
pansion in U.S. history, is show-
ing no signs of faltering.

Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige said the index has been
rising at an annual rate of 7.4 per-
cent over the‘ past six months, a
pace he said was consistent with
overall economic growth of be- ‘
tween 3 percent and 4 percent in
coming months. ,

The administration has predict-
ed that the economy, as meas-
ured by the gross national
product, will expand 3.2 percent
this year, substantially better than
the weak 2.5 percent GNP in-

crease in 1986.

While private economists
agreed that the leading index was
signalling continued expansion,
many said the rate of economic
growth would be little changed
from the sluggish performance of
the past three years.

’’I don't see any recession on
the horizon, but I don't see any
economic boom either,” said
Michael Penzer, an economist at
the Bank of America in San Fran-
cisco. ”The leading index sug-
gests we are going to continue to
have economic growth at a
modest pace of around 2.5 per-
cent, just where it has been since
the middle of 1984.”

The economy, as measured by
the GNP, shot ahead at a 4.8 per-

1'.

 Economy strong again in May 

cent rate in the first three months ‘

of 1987, but many analysts be-
lieve this pace will slump to a
barely noticeable 1.5 percent lev-
el in the April—June quarter as in-
dustries cut production in order
to work off unwanted inventories.

In a second report Tuesday, the
government said that orders to
U.S. manufacturers were un-
changed in May at a seasonally
adjusted $200.6 billion as a steep
decline in demand for military
hardware offset strength in
civilian categories. Analysts said
that for much of this year, ’
manufacturing orders have been
on the~rise, reflecting improve-
ments in sales by. American
manufacturers abroad.

JOHN
ENRIGHT

Looking for a pen pal? Well, if
you jaunt over to The Pitt News’
offices in the student union, I
have just the thing for you.

We have potential pen pals
coming out of our ears. Prisoners,
yes, prisoners, and some girl in
Korea are seeking some type of
correspondence with people who
read The Pitt News.

A few weeks back, Kang Ho-
sun, a college student in "Pusan,
Korea, wrote to me‘ requesting
that I print a letter that asks
American students to correspond

S with Korean students.

,Ho—sun wrote that having

-American pen pals would ”help
not only [Korean students] En-

glish and emotional life, but also
expand their knowledge of for-

_.--eign lands. This would also pro-

mote world-wide friendship and

] fmutual relationships as well as

serving as a true foundation of

world peace." _
That sounds fine to me. Ho-

sun’s plea is sincere, and it might

A - b_e a valuable forum for interac-
tions between Korean and Ameri- .

 fcan students. In "fact, the letter

Perspective section of the paper.

wasting away. Undoubtedly, pris-
oners lead boring, uneventful
lives. Sitting in ‘a dingy cell can
become quite dull, I'm sure,
‘although I've never experienced
the feeling.

The situation for two prisoners
at a prison in Ohio must be par-
ticularly troublesome,_ because
they've become so lonely and
distraught that they've taken up
the hobby of writing letters to
newspapers in hope that people
will write back to them.

Apparently, these letters start-
ed arriving at The Pitt News a few
years back. During the 1985-86
school year, Mary Daigle, who
was editor in chief of the paper
at the time, printed some of the
letters in the paper.

Here's a sample of what one
prison inmate in New York wrote
to the paper: ”I am a lonely, con-
fined prisoner who is seeking cor-
respondence with people who
would not mind corresponding
with a lonely, confined prisoner
— me.” - ' _ _

Jim Urban, who was sports edi-
tor at the time, said the-prisoners
became bold in their endeavor
and started asking for people to

send them money. Consequent— "

ly, the paper stopped pri nting. the
letters. _ .
The Pitt News continues to get

letters from various prisoners’

who wish to find pen pals. Two
weeks ago, I received letters from

Reginald Stivender and Picken.

Ramsey, inmates at a prison in

I London, Ohio.

After reading the letters, it was

obvious to me that Reginald and . .
Picken corresponded before writ— .

ing the letters, as both letters had
the same basic format.
Ramsey's letter was a. little

more interesting, so here it is, ex'_- ‘
actly as it was written:

Dearest Mr. Erkel [a former edi-

.-.~a .“.v.«-,.u.'_-'-3...

is Picken Ramsey and i’m writ—
ting to you concerning an ad that
i would like to have placed in
your Pitt News.

Do to the fact that i’m in pri-
son i need your help concerning
this letter, also i would very
much appreciate some outside
corrspondence. _

I thank you for taking my let-
ter into considiration also for tak-

ing the time it took to read it. j

Thank you Picken Ramsey.
my ad: Picken Ramsey 770 lbs,

5'8” tall, age 24, Hobbies are- .

football, swimming and horse-
back riding. With a golden brown
complexion. Send photo. Will
write all.

I'm still trying to figure out
what has the golden brown com-
plexion, Picken..or the'horses he
likes to ride.

Oh well, I guess I'll never
know. Unless, of course, I decide
to provide Picken with some out-
side corrspondence.

iOpening lines of communication

What strikes me about the let-
ter I received from Picken is his
ad. Does he really expect us to

print that? If we did print it,-

though, some lonely nut of the
opposite sex would probably
respond, and we'd have a bud-
ding romance on our hands.

I can see it now. Picken and his
pen pal will get married (even
though he's still doing time) and
the nation's scabsheets will have
a great cover story. Undoubted-
ly, The Pitt News will enter the

, picture and tell how it played an
integral part in this affair.

It could be a lot of fun. Picken
would get the outside corrspon—
dence he's-seeking, and The Pitt

News would receive some nice «

publicity. _

Of course, there's one small
problem — I lost Picken’s
address. '

What a shame.

pie, no matter how hokey it may
seem. So, because we need a
reminder so badly right now of
the greatness of our proud and
prestigious history, I have listed,
in no hierarchical order, 10 of the
best things that the concept ‘of the
United States of America have

donated to the history of the»

Western world.

1. The Constitution — The
supreme law of the land and truly
one of the greatest, most efficient

and most noble set of rules ever '

penned.
This document, the great level-
er of our country, which provides

for every freedom and right we
enjoy, is 200 years old this year.
We can only hope it will survive
forever. J
2. Baseball —— America's
pastime and the most fun you
could ever dream of having with
your clothes on, either as a par-
ticipant or as a spectator. Al-
though baseball is a derivative of
Cricket, it is purely American,
and no other sport, in terms of
both set-up and strategy, better
epitomizesthe original structure
of its heritage. '
Polo may be the sport of kings,
but baseball is the sport of heroes.
This can be read in the eyes of
almost any boy — big orlittle.
3. Thomas Jefferson -— Where
I come from, this is the man who
is the father of our country.
Statesman, father, president,
author of the Declaration of In-
dependence — and one of the
greatest, most perceptive and
most empassioned minds that not
only the country but the world
has ever seen.
I cannot help but think that if
he were around in this day and

age, we wouldn't be seeing such ,
. things as Contragate or across-

the-board inflation or a deficit
that may take three generations to
erase, providing the governmen-
tal spending stops now. If some-
one, such as Jefferson and his
counterparts, could devise a

country and its rules such that

they were applicable not only in
their own time but could" be
projected into the future as‘ well,
then he surely wou|d_be able to
dispense of this garbage right
now.

4. New York City — Think of it:

Anyone who was ever anyone .

walked down the streets of this
mighty monster, the harbor of
liberty in the great melting pot.

The- Empire State Building,

Central Park, crime, the Russian
Tea Room, more crime, the Vil-
lage -— this town has everything,

showcasing both the best and the

worst of American culture. All
you have to remember is to avoid
the worst .(i.e. the subways at
night, Harlem, etc.), and you're
home free.

_And I'll tell you — you'll never
be able to experience a better

C high than walking down Broad.-

way eating a crab from Chin
Wo’s or just a hot dog from some
midtown street vendor (I recom-
mend any of the ones outside of
Rockefeller Center) and listening

to anything composed by George

Gershwin. ,

5. The Adventures of Huckle-
berry Finn — Ernest Hemingway
once wrote, "All of American
literature stems from one book,
and that book is The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn." I can't
make a better statement than that.

Runners up: Melville's Moby
Dick, Fitzgerald's The Great Gats-
by, Salinger’s The Catcher in the
Rye and anything by William
Faulkner or Jack Kerouac.

6. California girls — Sigh.

7. Woody Allen — The Benja-
min Franklin of the 20th century.
Philosopher, poet, sage .— Woo-
dy sees all and tells it to others in
a style and manner all ‘his own.

Recommended works: Annie
Hall, Manhattan, Interiors ‘and
Hannah and Her Sisters, however
any of his zany comedies (i.e.
Love and Death, Everything You

9

Always Wanted to Know About

Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask) are .

just as acceptable. _

8. The American university —
Although England can boast of
Oxford and Cambridge, never
before in any one country has
there been such a concentration
of academia held in such high
regard. And, no matter which in-
stitution it is, from Yale all the
way down to the community col-
lege, learning’s place is one of
supreme importance.

Pitt. ,
9.. The Hot Dog — Self _ex-

planatory, anywhere’ from Coney .'

Island to the "O.”

10. Jazz — From its birthplaces ' I -
in New Orleans and the Mid-.

west, the music whose beat is
simultaneous with the pulse of
the entire country — fresh, pure
and solely the American sound.

Kick off your shoes and listen
to either Duke Ellington’s Take
the A Train, Count Basie's Back
to the Apple or any blues record-
ing (Billie Holiday or Miles Da-
vis recommended), and you'll see
what I mean.

I hope you all have’ a happy‘

and safe holiday. I am going to be
dubiously patriotic and spend
mine in Georgetown, but I want

fit known that under no circu_m-"g-if

stance whatsoever will I ever
drive a Chevrolet.

& THE WASHINGTON
SQUARES .
The_ Civic Arena
June 24, 1987

By Dave Zafris

Entertainment Editor

A Brian Wilson is a musical
genius —— but he's just-recently
remembered how to sing. »

Wilson wrote the lyrics and
nearly all of The Beachboys most
popular songs. During the
mid’60s,-he cranked out Top 40
classics ata rate that would make
Madonna cringe.

But the strainand pressure of
creating and sustaining a musical
genre put Brian in bed for a few
years, and he's just recently be-
gun his comeback.

The‘Beach Boys and Brian Wil-

_ son played to a dancing, singing
and generally frolicking crowd at

r the Civic Arena last week‘, as part
of the band's 25th anniversary
tour.

They Got Around

, The band played what the fans
~ wanted to hear. Beach Boys’
songs mainly fall into three
categories: surfing, cars and girls.
And sometimes there are cros-
sovers _—— ”Fun, Fun, Fun” has a
girl driving a T-bird, ”Surfer Girl”
mixes girls with. surfing, etc.

ed audience realized they were
allowed to pour onto the floor
and rush the stage. ‘

The crowdjumped to its feet
when The Beach Boys broke into
”Little Deuce Coup,” followed
by ”Shut Down,” ’’I Get
Around,” ”Fun, Fun, Fun” and
"409." ~

The response was so frenzied
that Love pointed out to the au-
dience and shouted, ”The. car
people!”

He said the reason The Beach
Boys like playing in Pittsburgh is

' because the city owns the biggest

convertible in the country — the
Civic Arena dome. It opened
when the band hit the stage and
stayed open as the sun went
down ‘behind the city" skyline.

Brian's Back
_ The real highlight of the show
was Brian Wilson. His high fa|set-
to voice made The Beach Boys
sound like The Beach Boys,
rather than the pitiful self-parody
they've become over the years.

Perhaps in tribute to Brian's
return, the band chucked its syn-
thesizers and horns and relied on
an organ, guitar, piano, bass and
percussions for most of its songs.

”Dance, Dance, Dance”
sounded right out of 1965» with
its jangly guitar intro. Carl -Wilson
played a lead guitar reminiscent
of Chuck Berry.

Carl was greatly influenced by
Berry and led the band to cover
Berry's ”Rock ’n’ Roll” and copy
guitar riffs for ”Fun, Fun, Fun”
and ”Surfin’ USA.” _.

Brian Wilson was still able to
hit the high notes on ”Surfer
Girl” and had the arena crowd
swaying back and forth to the
surfing anthem.

He sang songs from The'Beach
Boys’ classic Pet Sounds LP:
”God Only Knows,” the song
Paul McCartney once called the
most beautiful song ever written,
’’Sloop John B” and ”Wou|dn’t
It Be Nice.”

Still Dreaming
The band also played their ver-
sion of The Mamas and the Pa-
pas’ ”California D_reamin’.” Carl
Wilson pulled out a 12-string gui-

tar for the cover,~ which The
Beach Boys put on their latest
compilation LP. Ex-Byrd member
Roger McGuinn played lead on
the recording, and Wilson was
able to reproduce thesound live.

The encore was the '60s surf-
classic ”Wipe-out,” a song The
Beach Boys recently. recorded a
rap version of with none other
than the Fat Boys. They played
the tune without singing,
however, sparing the arena
crowd an assuredly souless at-
tempt at white surf-rap.

Unlike The Monkees and The
Grateful Dead, two bands still
cashing in on a lost generation,
The Beach Boys’ music continues
to represent the idea -of escape,
of going away to California in a
dream. And they sound better
than theyhave in a long time.

* * =l< * >l<

The Washington Squares
The Washington Squares
opened for The Beach Boys, and
they weren't given the warmest
of greetings. People were there to

sing along with the well-known -

songs, not to try out anew bohe-
mian band.

But while The Squares didn't s

have the crowd rushing the ‘stage’,
they did play a tight set of acous-
tic quasi-folk rock music.
They're new, they're hip — but
they're not new wave.
They play music that was on

the forefront when The Beach
Boys were actually surfing.
They're carbon copies of folksie
beatniks that gathered in Green-
wich Village a zillion years a o.

’ The Squares plugged through
”New Generation” and their cur-
rent single ”Can’t Stop The Rain”

with bold harmonies and jangly

acoustic guitar solos.

Q

    

 

 

Everybody Shut Up!!!

Unfortunately, it wasn't that
easy to hear the folksie intricacies
because the stupid 10,000 Beach
Boys fans were talking too much.
lt’s.kind of hard to concentrate on
listening while dodging the hor-
des of beach balls being tossed
around. - ~

But even in their striped uni-
forms and pre-psychedelic light
show, the band is more than just
a novelty. They could be-the new
generation of folk.

Roxanne_(Jean Hackett) grieves for Christian (Jeff Cummings) after their love affair ends tragically in Cyrano de Bergerac.

However, there are still many
similarities between this script
and those of Shakespeare.

“Like Shakespeare's great
plays, Cyrano is written in soar-
ing romantic verse, and the An-
thony Burgess translation is the
first to effectively‘ capture the
sparkling wit, the rhymeand the
audacity'of the original," said
directer Gillette A. ;Elvgren.

_,~_._- ‘...,,,._‘.»__,__«‘..._ ;. 1 ..-«...,._ .. -... .n.. 1  - 4 .

 

all some of Shakespeare's
specialties‘.

The plot,too, is remiscent of the
Bard’s work, even of the festival's
last production, Two Gentlemen
of Verona. ‘ »

Cyrano is a tale of loyalty an
friendship as well as a love trian-
gle; Both men pursue the same
woman, and both men ‘rely. on
each other’s characteristics to win

_. her'.__over —- andtogether, they do. V

 

Playing the title role is Jay
Brazeau from Canada. Although
this is his first role'in the Three

Rivers Shakespeare Festival, his"

credits elsewhere include Ber-
nardo and Player King in Hamlet
and Stefano in The Tempest.
Opposite Brazeau is Jean Hack-
ett as the pursued woman, Rox-

anne. Also in her festival debut,
Hackett has performed with
Richard Drevﬁlss and :W,as_ at“?  1,

   

seen in the MTM movie A Little

Completing the love triangle is

Jeffrey Cummings as Christian.

Witches of Eastwick cast no  

spells in screen adaptation

By Doug Payne

Staff‘ Writer

/John Updike is certainly one of
America's finest contemporary
novelists, so it should come as no

shock that his material would be- A

come entirely misrepresented on
screen.

Updike’s The -Witches of East-
wick, for better or worse, is the
result of pulp director George
Miller, and it is his comic-book
style direction that never allows
for one ounce of depth.

The‘ Witches of Eastwick, as

There is also an especially un-
necessary sub-plot involving the
evil abounding in Van ,Horne’s

seriousness, those scehes be-
come distracting and ugly.

The Witches of Eastwick" never
properly explores the darkness in-
herent to suburbia, middle-aged
womanhood, loneliness or the
role of sex in. society today.

While it barely hints at each,
the film is commendable for por-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, July T, 1987

Suzanne Vega: a new kind of rock star

ers, she hides behind the
shadows and folds of a dark
wardrobe.

In this industry of conceit and
facades, Vega stands alone. She
sings about child abuse, lonliness
and most of all — solitude. '

In ”,Solitude Standing,” the ti-
tle song for Vega’s second album,
Vega treats solitude as a cold
entity: '

Solitude stands by the window/
She turns her head as I walk into
_the room/Solitude stands in the
doorway/l’m struck once again
by her black silhouette/By her
long cool stare and her silence

The University of Pittsburgh

two of last year's starters ineligi-
ble to play this season as the in-
vestigation ‘widens concerning
the illegal payments made to the
two atheletes by a sports agent.

The two suspended players,
seniors Teryl Austin and Charles

many players who have been

A former Pitt football player,
Tony Woods, who was a first-
round draft pick of the Seattle
Seahawks, has also been impli-
cated in the case. ,

The problem of agents talking
to Pitt players, according to Gott-
fried, surfaced before last season.

surface last season, probably a

month before the season started,” '

said Gottfried. ”There were
rumors and calls frompeople say-

agents involved with our kids.”

Woods was questioned sever- '

al times during the season and on
each occaision steadfastly denied
any wrongdoing, said Gottfried.
However, once the season had
ended,‘ it was a different story.
”After recruiting was over Tony
Woods_came in tosee me and

-talked like there was something»

wrong,”' said Gottfried. ”I told

him I thought I could prove he

and our editors have pretty’

that Mike Gottfried is one of '
the bright, young coaches of

‘America. ' ~

”At Pitt, there is already

strong football tradition and a
solid recruiting base. Those
qualities, combined with Gott-
fried’s brilliant coaching mind,
are ingredients for success."

According to Athlon, ”Gott-
fried is the coach who can an-
swer the Panther’s prayers”
and has ”placed Pitt back on
the threshold of national
respectability." _

\‘.

As we near the All-Star break,
it's only fitting we take a look at
more of the good, the bad and
the ugly of America's, pastime,
baseball.

Mark McGwire, the Oakland
A's phenomenal first/third base-
man, was hitting a paltry .160,
when manager Tony LaRussa
made the brilliant decision to de-
mote Rob Nelson, another pow-
er hitter, and make McGwire his
everyday first baseman.

The New York Mets, the team
everyone’ loves to hate, are slow-
ly making their move on the
Cardinals. The Mets have scaled

thin shouting distance of the
Cardinals. '

The Cubs losing both Ryne
Sandberg and Shawon Dunston
to injuries is comparable to los-
ing the bread from a tuna fish
sandwich.

The Cubs infield isn't quite the ‘

same with Mike Brumley and
Paul‘Noce. Not that they're terri-
ble, they're just not good.

I'll probably say this until I'm
old and collecting retirement
checks. Jim Leyland has to find a
way to get Mike Diaz into the
lineup everyday.

Diaz may not have the best
glove in the field, but he's the
only legitimate power threat the
Pirates have right now.

The rumor mill has the Dodg-
ers’ Tommy Lasorda leaving Cha-

TARIIN

vez Ravine and moving to
Philadelphia to manage the
Phillies.

Speaking of the Dodgers, the
greatest thing that happened to
their infield occurred when short-
stop Mariano Duncan was placed

enough boxes in the Corn-

' out new cereals for fans of the

The Grubbs said they've
learned from their mistakes in
making and marketing Husker
All Stars and will take a differ-
ent approach with the Penn
State cereals. If future ventures
succeed, Husker All Stars may
be reintroduced, Mrs. Grubb
said.

Husker All Stars cereal was
made for Eagle Roost by a
company in Peru, Neb., but

be made Weetabix, a large

Grubb said he was working
with Penn State to include
trading cards showing Penn

Mrs. Grubb grew up in

The Giants’ Harry Spillman

he's predominately a pinch hitter,
Spillman is my idea of an elec-

If pitching really is 90 percent
of baseball, then the Baltimore
Orioles are in serious trouble.

They signed Doug Corbett,
making a pathetic bullpen even
worse.

In three appearances, Corbett
has given up 8 runs in 5 innings,
including two home runs. Oh
well, he can't get much worse.

Why the Pirates went after Ter-

I know statistics can be mis-

if the Detroit Tigers wouldn't win
more games if they'd commit
fewer than 71 errors.

ing, in the American League ap-
pears to be a lost art.

The Rangers should trade either
Larry Parrish or one of their other
outfielders. '

Second year pro Pete lncaviglia
has already committed 8 errors in
the outfield. Switching lncaviglia
to DH would open up a spot for
another one of the Rangers talent-
ed outfielders.

I'm only stopping here to vote
for Harry Spillman as a write-in
candidate for the All-Star game.

A Continued from page 13

with Bloom and Walters can be
traced back to the Blue Gray All-
Star Game. .

”l confronted Lloyd Bloom dur-
ing the game and asked him if he
had signed any of our players,”
said Gottfried. ”He lied to me
and said he hadn't."

Gottfried hopes‘ some good will
come out of the investigation.

When asked to summarize his
feelings towards Bloom and
Walters, Gottfried paused, and
then offered this statement.

”They’re deceitful, self-
righteous, publicity crazy and
liars.”

Despite the current con-
troversy, Bozik feels a deeper in-

vestigation of'Pitt’s athletic
programs is unnecessary.

”There is nothing endemically
wrong with our program,” said
Bozik. ”We haven't being doing
anything wrong at this in-
stitutiion. We have followed the
NCAA rules, and, in fact, have
gone beyond them.”

There is currently a registration

- program with the NCAA for

agents,” he continued. ”But it's
just that they have to make cer-

tain disclosures to the NCAA, and .
agree that they will not.sign ath— .-

letes prior to the expiration of
their eligibility. It obviously
hasn't worked. In the cases of Mr.
Walters and Mr. Bloom, they

weren't even registered. But even i

if they were, there's no sanction
available for the NCAA.”
