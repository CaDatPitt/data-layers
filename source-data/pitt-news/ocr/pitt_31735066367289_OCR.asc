Beginning today, Men’s Council
will sponsor a series of activity
discussions in the "weekly fresh-
man conference classes- During
the discussions a panel of four
students will explain the beneﬁts
gained from extra-curricular ac-
tivities.

The students participating on
the panels will include upper-

pus affairs, and who maintain a
high academic, average.

At the conclusion of each panel
discussion, the moderator will
open the meeting to questions
from the floor. Freshmen will

NixonGives
Talk Today
In Mosque

Vice—president Richard M.
Nixon, Republican nominee
for president, will give a ma-
jor address at the Syria Mos-
que tonight at 8 p.m.

The Youth for Nixon and
Lodge organization at the Uni-

versity has reserved a ﬁrst bal-
cony section in the Mosque. Mem-

bers of the group will meet Nix-
on after his speech.
According to Chairman Beverly

Roberts, “The arrival of Nixon
will be the climax in the series of

political activities on campus. It
should increase the lead Nixon
supporters have already indicated
in the student opinion polls.”

Vice President Nixon was sel-
ected by President Eisenhower as
his running mate in 1952 and
again in 1956. He has worked as
the President’s representative on
official travels in 32 foreign coun-
tries. .

Nixon served in the U.S. Navy
during‘”‘World War II, and spent
15 months in the Paciﬁc where he
earned two battle stars and two
commendations.

Nixon ﬁnished second in his
class at Whittier College and re-
ceived his law degree, with hon-
ors, from Duke University in 1937.

Nixon practiced law for ﬁve
years in Whittier before going
into World War II service. He was
elected to Congress in 1946, and
was re-elected in 1948 with the
nominations of both Republicans
and Democrats. He was elected to
the United States Senate in 1950.

The evaluation is a four-stage
process. The ﬁrst stage is a self-

Phi Deltd Theta on Probation .

All social fraternities have been
censured for the period of one
year according to a statement is-
sued by fraternity adviser, Ronald
Pease, last week at an interim-
ternity’ Council meeting.

“The censure came as a result
of fraternities being involved in
the possession and use of alcoholic
beverages within their respective
fraternity houses,” Pease said.
Pease deﬁned the censure as a
ﬁnal warning that a more severe
penalty would be forthcoming if
the practice continues or is ‘re-
peated. The minimum penalty
will be one academic term of so-
cial probation. 

Social probation according to a
recent IFC_report is the _“f0l‘bld-

duct social affairs within or out-
side of fraternity houses.”

“I hope that these infractions
of University regulations have re-
sulted from misinterpretation of
those same regulations rather
than a‘ total disregard of them,”
Pease stated. “I want to give each
fraternity every consideration in
this matter. Therefore, no discip-
linary action is being taken at this
time."

Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
however, has already been placed
on social probation for a period
extending from October 19, 1960
to March 1, 1961. ’

Interfratemity Judicial Com-
mission found Phi Delta Theta’
fraternity guilty of permitting ad-
mission of female guests ‘above

found guilty of actions and de-
portment of visitors contrary to
University rules.

Last March IFC attempted to
buck the University’s policy on
the use of alcoholicbeverages on
campus. The council had unani-
mously passed a motion to hold
a liquor party on campus. Plans
for this party failed.

The University’s policy on pos-
sessioning alcoholic beverages
“shall not be sold or served to
undergraduates on any" property
of the. University or at any Uni-
versity sponsored meeting or
function."

Former Editor
Of ‘Punch’ To
Talk At Midday

Malcolm Muggeridge, former
azine, “Punch,” will appear at the
Midday Series Wednesday at noon
in the SU Ballroom. __

His topic, “Englishmen and
Americans,” will explain the re-
lationship between England and
America, two countries lwhcil‘.
“are as alike as they are different
and are fated to misunderstand
each other.” .

Muggeridge was editor of
“Punch” from 1953 to 1957 dur-
ing which time he restored the
magazine to its frrmer position
as a critical analysis of the
British way of life.

At the present time, he is a
regular columnist for the British
newspaper "Sunday Pictorial”
and the “New Statesman and Na-
tion.” .

As a correspondent for the
“Daily Mirror,” he traveled with
Prime Minister Macmillan
through the United States and
Russia.

“Winter in Moscow,” written
in 1934 after Mug-geridge spent a
year "there as a correspondent,
was acclaimed as a daring critic-
ism of the Russian government.
He has also written “Affairs of
the Heart,” “In a Valley -of This
Restless Mind,” and “Autumnal
Face.”

He is now in the process of
writing a biography of George
Orwell. .

Fronts for Fraternity Houses Suggested

IF C Discusses Substitution
For Floats at Homecoming

By BOB SCHWIMNIER
A substitute for ﬂoat-building for Homecoming was one
of the major items discussed at the last meeting of the In-

terfraternity Council.

It was pointed out that the cost of building these ﬂoats
is great in both monetary value and manpower.
One suggestion put forth was to build fronts for the fra-

ternity houses because it wouldll

The Early Bird

Students should consider seriously the courses they
will elect for next trimester before meeting with their ad-
viserfor registration. ’

Registration began last ‘week, and will be conducted

.l._«until Nov. 23. Students should keep in_ mind that this is _
-7 “registration,” and not “pre-registration.” Upperclassmen

have become accustomed to the pre-registration program of
former years, which permitted them to make schedule

0 changes during a period before classes began. This is no

longer the procedure. Courses for which students sign up

T“ when meeting with their advisers will not be changed with-
W out the payment of late fees. '

An attempt should be made” by students to ﬁnd out all
*_ they needto know about the content of a course before

1 -scheduling it, so as to be sure it is what they want.

"Descriptions of coursesare available in the school bul-
'-letins, but further information can be obtained from friends
‘?who have taken the course, or from the faculty member
teaching it. ' '

If a student knows beforehand what material will be

. covered in a particular course, there is less chance that he.

will want to change the class during the first few weeks of
the term, and he will have avoided the necessity of pay-

ing a late fee.

‘ 9 The earlier the student meets with his adviser, the bet-
ter will be his chances of getting the courses he desires. Ten-
tative schedules should be planned in advance, and selec-
tions discussed and deﬁnitely decided upon whenthe stu-
dent meets with his adviser. I 

Although advisers can make suggestions and inform
the student. of the distribution requirements, they cannot
and should not decide a student’s. course for him. I

With some advance planning, ‘students can minimize

their registration difficulties and facilitate greatly the work-

er the Office of Student Records. 1 e -

By Jim Vaughan "

Words are tools. We use them to communicate
I More im-
portant, we use them to think. Because particular
words and combinations of words often represent
complex relationships, the ma- .

nipulation of certain words often
achieves meaningful and signiﬁ-
cant results. To achieve these
results, we must use words in
certain contexts. But when we
take words out of their proper
contexts we think unclearly and
often mislead ourselves.

Two words in particular are
often misused in this way. They
are the nouns “purpose” and
“beginning.”

Let’s begin with “beginning.” ’
When we use the word “beginning” to refer to

an object, we somehow think that this Object did’

not exist at one period in time, yet did, at another.
Desks, rainstorms, hiccups, speeches, I‘0manC€S,
thoughts, etc., are examples of things which we
say “‘have‘ beginnings.”

But the word “beginning” refers only to a
change in form. , ,

A giant tree “has its beginning” when 13“ acorn
takes root in the ground. After many years of
growth, huge quantities of carbon dioxide, water

and minerals are absorbed from the surrounding_

earth 'into the growing trée. With the help of
the acorn and the sun, this matter takes the form
of an oak tree. V

Ma'H-er Does Not "Begin"

This tree “had its beginning” in a relative sense
only. The minerals of which it is composed existed
before the acord was planted. They were merely
transformed from the form of_ earth into the form
of a tree. There was no creation of matter itself
here, nor was there any disappearance of. it.

p, The tree is chopped down and sent to a lumber
mill. The tree comes to an end. But. its matter
continues to exist. The woody-matter takes the
form of boards, then a desk.

When we point to something and say that it
“had a beginning” we are being meaningful only
if we are referring to the particular conformation
that its matter is now taking. We must not use
the word “beginning” refering to the existence of-
matter itself. _

Yet, people often look around at the world and,
using the relative meaning of the word “beginning,”
ask with a wide swe'ep of the arm: “What was the
beginning of all this?” A .

When a man asks this question, he misuses the
word “beginning.” Because, when properly used,

‘ the word refers to the particular form matter takes,

not the actual existence of the matter itself.
It's Just‘ a Word‘ _ ' -

As for the word “purpose,” it has no physical
referent. A person does not “have” a “purpose” as
he “has” a hat. _

The “purposefulness” that is attributed to some

object does not arise from’ any quality of the object.

itself, but from the actions of those people who con-
structed it. To be more accurate, people act
“purposefully.” , -

 

   

‘ P u rpose'

When used. properly, the word “purpose" (or
“purposefulness”) is understood operationally. That
is, whatever is said to be “purposeful” is the result
of someone’s planning and his need for something.
For example, a boy sees an apple growing out of
reach. In order to get the apple, he picks up a
stick and knocks it down. An action of a person is
“purposeful” if it is taken in such a way that the
actor believes it will bring him closer to his goal.

A “purpose” develops in a special way. There
is first a person. That person has a goal. After be-
coming aware of the goal, either consciously or un-
consciously, the person acts to reach that goal. It
is these actions that are called “purposeful.” When

. someone’s behavior is not goal-directed, we saythat

it is “purposeless.” - .

The need or desire to reach a goal always pre-
cedes the appearance of a “purposeful” action. For
example, thepneed for typewriter ribbons existed
ﬁrst. Then came the invention of ribbons. The
same applies to everything about us which we say
“has purpose”: ink, tools, shoes, light bulbs, clocks,
etc. I ’

“Purpose” must not be confused with “function.”
A candle functions to give off light; but its “pur-
pose” is to permit men to ﬁnd their ways in dark
places. A garden hose functions to transport water
without leakage; its “purpose” is to save time and
energy otherwise expended in transporting water.
Behavior ls +he.Coni-ext

“Purposefu1ness” thus refers speciﬁcally to man’s
behavior — his ideas, speech and actions. The
word “purpose” arises in the context of behavior.
But for the sake of convenience and emphasis, it is
easier to transfer the “purposefulness” from the
actor’s actions and intentions to that which he has
built.

We say hence that a dam has a “purpose” when
actually the persons responsible for its construction
acted “purposefully.” We say, similarly, that a
chair has a “purpose,” when it was really built for
the “purpose" of sale and use.

But we must remember always that “purpose”
arises fundamentally in the context of behavior.
Those actions and things which are attributed with
“purpose” are instruments. They are connecting
links between men and goals. ,

Yet, men never cease to look around at the world
and at themselves and ask the question, “What’s
the ‘purpose’ of all this?” When they‘do this, they
misuse the word “purpose” which can only refer
fundamentally to behavior. ,

Man Has No "Purpose" ‘” =

Just as telephone. poles, walls, windows, tables,
streets, curbs, paint, cars, etc., have “purpose” or
were made “purposefully,” men gne,edn’t think they
must “have a purpose.” A telephone “has a pur-
pose”; it is an instrument between man and his goal.
But man doesn’t “have a purpose” in this sense; he
cannot logically be an instrument between himself
and his goals. Whoever heard of a butter knife
serving its own ‘‘purpose?’’ , _

If it is true that the words “purpose” and “be-
ginning” are taken out of their proper contexts
when applied to man’s existence, then it is meaning-
less (though quite useful) to say that man “has a
purpose”; similarly, it appears that matter always
existed, but in an ever-changing form.

Editor,’ The Pitt News:

It is agreed, both by myself
and a representative of the
Honor Core, that the University

is. plainly corrupt with cheating.-
The problem is a real one; but‘

I don’t feel that the’ Honor Core
is a real way of solving it.

First of all, I; don’t particular-
ly like the idea of card—carry-
ing, self-appointed spies. But, in
the true sense, these people, or
at least a good part of them,

cannot be referred to as spies.

I do believe they’l1 watch; but I

don’t believe they’ll report.
There’s bound to be complica-

tions when one spy sees his

buddy cheating. And, of course, .~

before the spy goes to the in-
structor,\he’s bound to stop and
think of just how the instructor
will take his action. Let’s face
it. Tattle-taling is a messy busi-
ness and one which most people
would much rather avoid.

And it can be avoided. I sug-
gest, the following: if , y

,1. Thatwe quiggwasting‘ time

2. Thatthe University adopt a
policy of immediate expulsion of
any student found . cheating.

3.’ That the University make
‘it clear to all entering fresh-

vmen, prior to their entrance,

that suggwtion 02 has been
adopted. '

4. That the Freshmen Orienta-
tion Program should include a
series of lectures which fully
explain the University’s position
on honor. P

Naturally, this will take time
and patience. No change can be
expected of those already at-
tending the University, for they
are set in their ways. But. we
can, and I believe should do
something with the future fresh-
men.

At present, they enter Pitt and
realize that cheating is a natural
thing. They realize, also, that
the grade they take home is
what counts, for parents rarely
ask whether or not it is an hon-_
est grade.

Core whose methods seem to re-
semble Fascism, but an. entire

yhat is expected of them and

’which feels morally responsible’.

to carry out these expectations.
Bring up a freshman in the
way he’s expected to go, and
when he is a senior, he will not
depart from it.

Traficant Passes to

Yaccino for Only TD

By TED COLTON

For the second time this year the “Fighting" Panthers
were unable to break a 7-7 deadlock and as a result they now
hold the distinction of having a very unusual record of 2-2-2.
Of course Texas Christian doesn't think there is anything un-
usual about this record since they hold an identical chart.

Before the game the Cats and TCU were said to have

identical teams. Both were bigé

and strong with not to much
speed. They even had the same
record. The Panthers were install-
ed a two point favorite.

The ﬁrst half looked like the
miss match of the season with
TCU completely out-classing the
Blue and Gold. But in the second
half both teams reversed their
roles.

Sharockman ‘Goes’

The game was marked by sev-
eral questionable plays, a free-
for-all and the most spectacular
run of the year. At the end of the
first period Quarterback Ed Sha-

by several TCU linemen, got
away, picked up a key bl-ock,
eluded another would-be-tackler,
and raced 75 yards for the Pan-
thers’ longest run of the year.

He was still 14 yards shy __of -
a touchdown. The Blue and
Gold failed to score when a Jim
Traﬁcant pass was intercepted
near the goal line.

The questionable plays involved
End Mike Ditka. In the third
quarter Ditka got behind a TCU
back and ‘ Traﬁcant’s pass was
short.

Ditka Explains

Ditka explained the play, “The
ball was held up by the wind. I
reached back‘ and -got my hands.
on it just before it reached the
ground. I was falling so I tipped
the ball over my head, turned
around and made the catch.”

He continued, “The referee
turned his head for a second and
didn't follow the play.” Need-
less to say. the pass was ruled
incomplete. The official claimed
it hit the ground. _

The other questionable play

came in the closing minutes of

the ball game. The Panthers were
on the march on TCU’s 43 yard
line. There was a fourth and nine
situation.
Free-For-All

Trafficant tried to hit Ditka

with a short pass but the big end

ED SHARK
Runs 75 Yards
never got the ball. Two TCU

defenders had Ditka on the
ground as the pass was in the

air. But again the referees eyes

were elsewhere.

Four plays later the free-for-
all began. Several TCU players
could be found using their hel-
mets for tools of war but the
Panthers got in their licks be-
fore it was all over.

The Panthers tied the game in
the ﬁnal’ period with a Traficant
to John Yaccino pass.

St. Louis Down Rooters, 4-0’; , 

Suffer 3rd Straight Shutout

Bemis Changes Cats Defense But
Billikens Still Able to Find Holes

St. Louis University handed‘

the Panther booters their
fourth straight loss by a 4-0
score Saturday in St. Louis.-

The 1959 NCAA champions ,

scored once ll‘! each quarter,

while holding the Cats scoreless.
Despite heavy winds both teams

displayed ﬁne passing attacks

which brought cheers from the
crowd. Jerry Balassi kicked in

-the ﬁrst goal late in the opening

quarter on a penalty shot after
Fullback Chuck Dunbar had foul-
ed the Billiken’s outside left Tom
McConnell.

Co-captain Don Range made it
2-0 when he blased the ball
through the goal posts from out-
side the 18 yard line. Early in the

‘ second half Bob Trigg chalked up

third tally. Trigg is the Billiken’s
high scorer with nine goals to his
credit.
Defense Tough
McDonnell registered the ﬁnal
point with a left-footed kick into
the corner of the net. St. Louis
took 35 shots at the Panther goal.
The Billiken defense proved
to be too tough for the small
Cat line, and as a result held the
scoring attack to six shots. Ed

playing at the inside positions,
took the ball deep into enemy
territory many times only to be
stopped short by a determined
defense.

Coach Leo Bemis had instituted
a special defensive lineup for St.
Louis, but the fast-breaking boot-
ers from Missouri managed to
penetrate even this.

Ca]. Smith was moved from his
regular slot at center fullback to
ﬁll Smith’s place, and Paul Liber-
ati filled the gap at halfback.
This left the line with only four
men.

Bemis Satisﬁed

St. Louis is rated the toughest
opponent on the schedule. Consid-
ering how injury-ridden his
squad is, Coach Bemis was fairly
satisﬁed at their showing, despite
the loss.

This was the third consecutive
game that the Cat soccer team
was shut out. St. Louis probably
had the best defense the team
will have to meet all year, since
they were also able to shut out
Michigan State.

The game left the Panthers
with a 2-4 composite record for
this season with ﬁve games re-
maining. Two of_the ﬁve oppo-
nents, West Chester and Howard,

   

Weihrauch and Pete Smith,

were in last year's top ten.

     

   

   

  
   

Harriers Finish Second In

Triangular Meet,i Stokes Ist  

A
T

By JIM O'BRIEN
Navy proved a poor host at Annapolis as they scored a
triangular meet victory over the Panther harriers and the
neighboring Georgetown team, scoring 26 points to 44 and

59 respectively.

The Jungle Cats were looking over their shoulders for
the favored Hoya runners and the Midshipmen swarmed by

to capture the run.

Harry Stokes ‘took off at the
start and ran his own race to kill
off the rest of the pack as he out-

distanced Bob Verdisco of
Georgetown by 15 seconds in the
winning time of 26:06.7 over the
ﬁve mile course.

No Final Spurt

Harry jogged to the ﬁnish line,
ignoring a ﬁnal spurt which
would have cut his time. “I didn‘t
want to put on any grandstand
show,” he confessed. As it stood
he was only 30 seconds off the
record time established byiBill
Kankle of Navy last year.

Navy claimed the four posi-
tions from third to sixth, and
their ﬁfth man was only eighth
as they ran 'in a close pack.
Georgetown. whom Coach Carl
Rees feared the most, only had
two runners in the ﬁrst ten ﬁn-
ishers. “We expected them to
be real tough,” Rees claimed,
“and Navy surprised us and won
the meet.”

Bob Tarkany was the second
runner for the Cats, ﬁnishing sev-
enth. He was nosed out of sixth
by ﬁve tenths of a second. Co-
captains Bill Hinchberger and
Reed Clarke ran 10th and 11th,
with John Towne, 15th, John
Hart, 17 and Vance Carter, 20th.

Week Off

The Panthers now have a dis-
mal 1-4 record and have been
beaten by ﬁve teams so far. They

were spread out too much as
Navy again slipped by in solid
pack to cop team honors. Navy
edged the Cubs 28-30, while the
Hoyes had 76.

Mosnik, who won against Penn
State and the Jeannette Harriers,
ﬁnished 12 seconds ahead of John
Howard of Navy in 15:53.7. Right
behind were Larry Robinson and
Steve Waslo of the Panther Cubs,
tying for third. ,

The Navy plebes grabbed off
the next four positions to clinch
the win. A. J. Rice ﬁnished 9th,
with Bob Henry, 13th, Dick Cook,

16th and Jim Haylor, 20th. Rice’

missed 8th place and a team tie
by one second. ,

It was the ﬁrst defeat for the
Panther yearlings, who now have
a 2-1 chart.

F rosh Gridders

42-0 on Friday

The freshman gridders played
Kent State Friday afternoon at
the Practice Field and emerged
42-0 winners.

Rick Leeson again led the scor-

ing with two touchdowns, the ﬁrst '

a two yard plunge and the second
a 52-yard draw play. Bob Guts-
hall scored on a 68-yard jaunt
around left end while John Gregg,

J

Ray Conway, and Paul Martha ‘

closed out the scoring.

The Panther Cubs showed
their usual hardnosed defense
only allowing Kent State inside
the 40 twice. “It hasbeen the
defensive unit that has played
the important role before the
offense could get moving,” said
Acting Coach Bill Kaliden.

The only casualty was Gerry
Cherry who suffered a slight con-
cussion and was taken to West
Penn Hospital for observation.

John Yaccino Sparks
’Cat Offensive Attach

Hazelton Halfback Offered 85 Scholarships
But Waits for Panther Coaches to Call *-
By JACK SIVIITH

In pre-season player ratings, Panther coaches considered
John Y accino to be one of the team’s most improved runners.
Yaccino, however, remained in the background, until the

last two gridiron games.

Now the ﬂeet—footed halfback is running with the sec-

ond team and pressing for a chance to be number one back
'on the Panther eleven. 6

 

‘-I weighed 170 pounds lastgyear
and wasn’t hard to bring down,”
Yaccino explained. “I tacked on
23 pounds which seems to be
helping me run harder and fast-
er.”

Yaccino Injured

Until the last two games, both
won by the Panthers, Yaccino’s
yards per carry average was al-
most the lowest on the team. By
averaging close to 8=yards a carry
in the last ‘two games‘ his overall

0 average is 3.8 yards, fourth among

all Panther runners.‘

Actually, Yaccino would have
played more last year but an in-
jury in the USC game prevented
that. As Yaccino explains it,
“Bad Miike McKeever put me
out of action.”

Yaccino hails f r o m Hazelton,
Pa., where he attended high
school and lettered in football,
basketball, baseball and track. He
gained a1l—American recognition
in football and received 85 offers
from colleges all over the nation.
But Yaccino wanted to attend

-Pitt, the college from which his
/father graduated.

Cats Not Interested

But for a while it appeared as
though the Panthers were not in-
terested in him. “Ever since I was
a kid I wanted to come to Pitt.
But when the University had not
contacted me I was afraid I might
have to attend somewhere else,”
Yaccino said.

One night Vic ‘Fusia called me
on the phone. I accepted his‘of-
fer immediately. That proba-
bly came as quite a shock to
Fusia, but it was the call I had
been waiting‘ for.”

When Yaccino ﬁrst came to Pitt
he was tagged with the name
Yack. “One day in an English
class a professor called me Yack-
cinno,” John-said. “Some of the
football players caught wind of it
and I’ve been stuck with the
name ever since. Even the coach-
es call me that now.”

Taught to Block

Yaccino credits much of his
new-found success to Vic Fusia.

. “He and the other coaches taught

Panther Shooters

Bang Away But
Still Lose to Tech

The Panther riﬂe team went
down to their ﬁrst defeat of the
year last Wednesday at the hands
Of Carnegie Tech. This was the
ﬁrst Cat riﬂe match in two years.

The Blue and Gold made a sur-
Drisingly strong showing of them-
selves as they were able to score

‘I340 points. But this was not

. enough to overcome Tech’s 1371

av

r

“it

total points.

“Our boys were nervous be-
fore the match but when it was
all over they felt conﬁdent that
we are going to have a good
year,” said Acting Captain Karol
Lober.

There are 1500 total possible
Points in a riﬂe match and the
1340 points that the Panthers
3Q0I‘ed surprised everyone, even
members of the team.

” Next Friday the Blue and Gold
Will travel to Washington, Pa. to
take on Washington and Jefferson.

But ﬁrst or last on the Pan-
thers‘ eleven, Yaccino brings
along his own rooting section in
his parents, Michael and Edith,
and his brothers Jim and Mike.
They have attended almost all
the Panther games in the last
two years,

A junior majoring in business,
Yaccino hopes to return to his
home town of Hazelton upon
graduate to teach and coach.

Although he has another year
of football play left, his thoughts
are only on this season. “We have
a good team this year,” Yaccino
said. “We’re going all the way,
and this means even Syracuse.
This is one team we have a score
to settle with.” And, Yaccino
wants to be part of that score.

   

BESIDES HIS ﬂashy form on the football ﬁeld, John Yaccino is
quite handy with the books as he gives Kathy Rahill a hand with
her English in the Student Union lounge. Rahill is a. sophomore
in the school of education and Yaccino spends his Saturday after-
noons pleasing Panther rooters with brilliant broken ﬁeld running.

JACK SAVED HIS COMPANY $10,000
ON HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT

While Jack Trabert was in college he had
some deﬁnite career ideas. He knew what he
wanted—a job with a payoff for good judgment
and hard work.

With a B.S. in Business Administration from
the University of Nebraska, Jack knew he could
look in many directions. And he did. He talked
to 20 companies. And then in August, 1957,
joined Northwestern Bell, in Omaha, Nebraska.

His chance to show What he could do was
not long in coming. On his ﬁrst assignment Jack
came up with answers that made it possible to
handle long distance calls made at night in the
Omaha area with less force and equipment than
was needed under the old system. This resulted
in a $10,000 annual saving. ’

Next, Jack Worked on a training and devel-

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intel-
ligent, positive and 2'nzag2'natz't'e men
we can possibly ﬁnd.”

FREDERICK R. KAPPEL, President
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

 

 

opment program for “mark sensing”—a new
method for mechanized processing of long dis-
tance charges.

Today, Jack has an important role in plan-
ning and developing telephonefacilities to keep
pace with Omaha’s ever—increasing need for long
distance services.

Jack puts it this way—-"If a guy can keep
his average up, there are places to go in this
outﬁt. A man doesn't have to wait around for
opportunity to knocli—he has all he can handle
right from the start.”

If you zcant a job in which you’re given a chance
to show your stuﬁ, and held strictly accountable for
your decisions, right from the start-then you’ll
want to visit your Placement Oﬂice for literature
and additional iinformatioin.
