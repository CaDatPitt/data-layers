She says she battles to rep-
resent the women who are
survivors of exploitation. She
insists the real issue is not
freedom and it is not speech.
It is inequality.

He says the issue is the pro-
tection of the First
Amendment and all it entails.
He believes it is views like
hers which threaten what
America was built on, the
freedom of speech and the
freedom of association. V

The hot topic that has set
tempers aﬂame is pomogra-
phy, and at opposite ends of
the debate are two of
America’s foremost authori-
ties on pornography and the
First Amendment, Catharine
MacKinnon and Nat Hentoff,
respectively. '

The heated debate was held
in the Teplitz Courtroom in

were forced to leave.

The positions of both on
whether government can regu-
late pornography without vio-
lating the First Amendment
were firmly established before
they stood head-to—head in
their first-ever debate.

MacKinnon is a renowned
feminist legal scholar and

University of Michigan law.

professor. She is best known
for her role in arming the vic-
tims of sexual harassment in
the work place with the ability
to sue their employers.
Recently she wrote that
“Protecting pornography
means protecting sexual abuse
as speech, at the same time
that both pornography and its
protection have deprived
women of speech, especially
speech against sexual abuse.”
Hentoff, Village Voice
writer and nationally syndicat-
ed columnist for the
Washington Post whose
stature as a free speech advo-
cate has reached national
dimensions, is also no

Hentoff began his discus-

He went on to question
what he believes is the most
pressing issue at hand.

“What is porn? And who is

Hentoff. “That is what fright-

resourceful  

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

(Editor’s note: This is the sec-
ond part in a two-part series on
theatre lab productions.)

One rainy night during
rehearsals for “The Last Words
of Dutch Schultz,” a Pitt
Theatre lab production, Ray
Burtoff headed to the mall seek-
ing bargains on three props — a
gavel, acigarette case and a
lighter appropriate to the period
of the play. Burtoff was to play
the lead role of Arthur
Flegenheimer, a.k.a. Dutch
Schultz, the bootlegging gang-
ster of the 1920s and ‘30s.

On his way he saw a small
garage sale closing up and tak-
ing cover from the bad weather.
He stopped to see what trinkets
he might find. As he
approached he saw on the table,
laying in a small group, a gavel,
a cigarette case and a Zippo
lighter. Burtoff snatched them
up at the kind price of $10.

“Divine gifts are never to be
questioned,” Burtoff said, “only
accepted.”

These are the kind of breaks
directors of lab productions
wish for, and need, to produce a
play on $50 and limited access
to the theatre department’s
resources. '

So how do they do it on a $50
budget?

“We don’t,” is the answer
given by Kyle Deise, an
M.A./Ph.D. student, who along
with his actors spent his own
money to buy props and audio
tapes for the sound in the pro-
duction. ’

Law Dean named to state judicial board

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

Associate clean at the Pitt law school
Sandra Jordan has been appointed to
the Judicial Conduct Board of the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court

The Judicial Conduct Board is made
up of 12 members who deal with the
conduct of judges in the state.

, The board’s responsibilities include
investigating all complaints of miscon-
duct by judges and filing charges for
those misconducts if warranted.

Jordan was formally sworn in on Oct.
12 by Supreme Court Justice John P.
Flaherty.

“In becoming a member of the body
that ‘judges the judges,’ Sandra Jordan
is assuming a role of extraordinary

responsibility. There could be no more
important function, no more thankless
function, than that what Dean Jordan
has been appointed to do,” Flaherty
said.

Since her 1979 graduation from the
Pitt School" of Law, Jordan has been
federal prosecutor and has also served
on an independent counsel during the
Iran-Contra investigation.

This is not Jordan’s first time on an
ethics committee, she also served on
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
Disciplinary Board, which dealt with
misconduct by attorneys.

Jordan said dealing with the ethical
conduct of judges can be much differ-
ent then dealing with attorneys.

“This board is presenting some
unique situations. You are talking about

people in power. This board involves
judges and the public trust that judges
hold,” she said.

Jordan is very active in the field of
law. In addition to the Judicial Conduct
Board, she also serves on several other
boards, including Forbes Health
System Board and American Inns of
Court.

“There is a lot of times I often think I
may be doing too much, but this board
is so important I could not pass up the
opportunity when it was offered to
me,” Jordan said.

Jordan said she is very honored to be
appointed to the board and she plans to
work hard to fill the position. while
holding no personal agenda.

Jordan will serve a three-year term
which ends in August of 1998.

Placement Center signs on to the World Wide Web

America is rapidly becom-
ing a nation of “Net
surfers.” A recent survey

indicated that 14 percent of-

the population currently
uses on-line services, the
Internet or other modes of
computer communication.
And this trend is being

noticed and exploited by,

recruiters. More and more
companies are using cyber-
space as a means of adver-
tising vacancies and finding

, candidates. For college stu-

dentsfthis applies to full-
time professional jobs as
well as to internships and
career-related summer
employment. So if you’re
going to take full advantage
of all your job search
options, you better learn the
rudiments of “surfing” for
jobs.

The first thing to do is get I

on the information super-
highway. The part of this
highway we’re interested in
is called the World Wide
Web (or WWW, or just “the
Web”). To help us to navi-
gate through the Web, we’ll
use a type of program called
a graphical browser. One of
the most popular browsers
is ca‘lled Netscape. After
you’re logged on, look for
Netscape on the menu of
programs, and click on the
‘N’ icon (Note: some com-
puters may be loaded with

Mosaic software instead of -

Netscape for ‘Web brows-
ing.) If you’re‘having a
problem getting onto the
Web, the user consultantsat
the labs can help you. ,
Once you’re on, let’s pick
our destinations, or Web
sites. Every place on a real
highway has an address to
make it possible to find it
-- the virtual highway is no
different. The first location
to check out is the
University of Pittsburgh’s
location on the Web, also
called Pitt’s “homepage.”
You’ll probably be there

Toavis

P  ele Ct in

already, since most of the
Netscape programs loaded
in on-campus computers
will automatically open to
our homepage. Use the
computer mouse to point
and click on the different
“buttons” on the Page that
take you to its different
parts (such at “Pitt
Campuses” and “Faculty
and Staff”).

Pitt has some great infor-
mation on its homepage, but
for now let_’s move on and
learn another Net search
technique. Move your
mouse pointer to the “File”
menu at the top of the
screen, and point and click
on “Open Location.’-’ In the
space provided, type in the
following Web site address
(called the URL):
http://www.placement.pitt.
edu. You should now be in
the Placement Service’s
homepage,_a good place to
start your job searching.

Let’s begin by selecting
“Jobs” after clickingon the
“Students and Alumni” but-
ton. The Part-Time/Summer
Employment Office lists all
kinds of employment oppor-
tunities in this section.
Other buttons on the
Placement Page provide
valuable information as
well. For you graduating
seniors, there’s a list of the
companies doing on-campus
recruiting at Pitt this year.
Plus there’s helpful advice

for résumé writing,
researching companies and
interviewing.

You can also access other
Web sites with nationwide
and worldwide job listings,
company information and
employment opportunities
in the same way that you
accessed the Placement
Service Page. Go to “Open

Theatre

‘From page I

Deise directed and adapted
“The Last Words of Dutch
Schultz” from a screenplay by
William S. Burroughs.
Originating from Burroughs, the
avant-garde. beatnik novelist,
Deise’s version would expected-
ly be on the dark and surreal side
of the theatrical spectrum.

Deise staged his show on the
Cathedral of Learning loading
docks. Here the eerie echoing of
voices filled the cavernous
space, enhancing the sinister
feeling of a piece ﬁlled with vio-
lence and tough guys in fedoras.
Surrounded by dim lighting,
concrete and echoes, you got the
feeling that you were trapped in
a back alley, a witness to the real
crimes.

“The space and the piece go
hand in hand,” Deise said.

No one in the theatre depart-
ment can remember a play being
staged in this location.
Ironically, if the play had been a
workshop or a mainstage pro-

duction with a bigger budget, a

longer run and a larger audience,
the space more than likely

wouldn’t have been available, _

said Rich Keitel, theatre arts pro-

fessor and faculty advisor for

many of the lab productions.
The short run and smaller

audience that comes to lab pro-'

ductions made it possible to

stage the play in this obscure ‘

spot.

Howard Williams Jr., a senior
theatre arts major, directed his
first lab production, “Elliot
Loves,” and did not want his
production to look as if it had
been done on a $50 budget, so
he enlisted the help of some
good friends with resources.

- He had the front of an eleva-
tor, complete with working
doors, built by a friend, Diane
Melchitzky, who offered her ser-
vices for free. Michael “Quick”
Corrado, a friend and local DJ,
lent his skills to play tunes from
Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix
that Williams thought his 30-
something characters would

have enjoyed.

Despite the many generous
contributions, VVi1liams, like the
other directors, estimates his
total costs to have ranged around
$120, which can be attested to
by his roommates who patiently
waited for his ‘share of the rent.
He had spent it after depleting
his allotted $50 in an hour buy-
ing ﬂyers, ﬁlm and ﬁlm devel-
oping.

Joel Lee Kulp, a junior theatre
arts major, was the ﬁrst to direct
a lab production this semester.
He chose “Action,” a play by the
contemporary dramatist Sam
Shepard. The play involves
smashing chairs and gutting fish,
a wake—up call to both the eyes
and the nose. Finding the
turkeys, fish and chairs for
smashing — things sure to run
up a budget in a hurry — was
one of Ku1p’s first concerns. He
needed eight raw fish and six
turkeys for the four perfor-
mances of “Action.’.’

Wholey’s fish market in the
Strip District donated the fish,
and Boston Market donated six
rotisserie chickens. Not quite the
golden turkey the script calls for,
but close enough. Kulp found
some chairs and had the screws
loosened so that smashing and
reassembling them would be
easy, making them last through-
out the play’s run.

Kulp said he told his actors
from the first rehearsal that it
would be an intense three
weeks.

“I said to everyone, ‘It’s going
to be really difficult, it’s going to
be really fast. Be ready for it,”’
Kulp said.

Keitel sees the lab productions
not only as training for directors,
but for actors as well. ‘

“A lot of times the actor’s first
time on stage will be in a lab
show,” he said. “Instead of hav-
ing a small role in a mainstage,
they get a lead role in a la 

This can be seen in Ray
Burtoff, whose performance of
Dutch Schultz markedhis Pitt
Theatre debut. Burtoff is a psy-

chology major who has only

taken an introductory level per- '

formance course. He said that
unlike other programs at Pitt,
theatre is not set aside exclusive-
ly for theatre arts majors. The
audition forms don’t even ask
what performance classes you
have taken. ,

As a relative newcomer to the
department’s productions,
Burtoff has a fresh view on what
makes Pitt Theatre special. The

hard work and dedication found I

in most theatre companies is
definitely there, he said, but
something sets Pitt productions
apart from the rest.

“What makes Pitt Theatre dif-
ferent is the passion they put into
everything they do,” he said.

While other colleges and uni-
versities have something like
Pitt’s lab productions, few are so
extensive or offer so much free-
dom, Keitel said.

Because of the four or ﬁve lab

- productions added to the line-up

each semester, Pitt Theatre does
15-20 productions a year, as
opposed to other schools who
only do four or so. This gives
Pitt room to produce experimen-
tal projects, especially in the labs
where the audience is smaller.
Productions like “Action,” one
of Shepard’s earlier plays that is
seldom done or even written
about (Kulp said he had trouble

even researching the play), or

“Dutch Schultz,” adapted by
Deise himself, are ones sure to
remainunique to Pitt.

These plays that would other-
wise remain unseen are brought
to life by Pitt directors and
actors. In the case of the lab pro-
ductions, there is quality without
cost — sparing the time, energy
and sanity of the cast and direc-
tor. But audiences get the real
bargain when it comes to cost.

“A bad movie is five or six
bucks,” Keitel said. “You can
see a lab for one, two or three
dollars.”

You can still check out one
more lab production this semes-
ter; “Phaedra” runs_Nov. 16-18.

graphic? It would be impossible to remove all that would trigger
sexual feelings and violence.”

MacKinnon countered by saying that women began talking
about pornography. particularly the survivors of those used in
explicit materials. They spoke out against those “masturbating to
the human rights violations of women.”

She stressed that the public needs to look at what’s in the mater-
ial, ranging from Playboy to Snuﬁ‘, where women are killed for
sexual pleasure.

“To clarify, the proposed ordinance would stop harmful materi-
al when they’re actually proved. It wouldn’t include all the exam-
ples given by Mr. Hentoff, it wouldn’t be a simple choice,” said
MacKinnon.

MacKinnon went on to elaborate on the findings that CMU stu-
dent Marty Rimm unveiled in his study on pornography on the
Internet, which she said broke new ground, despite the controver-
sy surrounding its sources. ' A

“It shows what is really out there and what people actually do
use. It’s nice to see it in writing,” said MacKinnon. “It was
achieved in a way never before done, not for masturbation or for
money, but for true study. The truth about porno went public. It

Hentoff ended his argument with his concerns with “the slip-
pery slope.” He said he shivers at the thought of the range of
works that could be affected.

“I want to know who draws the line,’’ said Hentoff. “Who
decides is the core of it all. MacKinnon will not be able to person-
ally say what is ‘proved’ harmful.”

  Censorship sucks

5

 

When was the last time you sat in front of your computer,
clicked on the little icon, and opened up to something along the
lines of Hustler magazine? It could have been yesterday, it could
have been a year ago, but if some members of the government
have their way, it may not be in the future.

That is what two of America’s foremost authorities on the First
Amendment met to debate last night at Pitt’s law school.
Catherine McKinnon, professor of women’s studies at the
University of Michigan, and Nat Hentoff, Village Voice colum-
nist and former Washington Post columnist, squared off in a
debate regarding whether or not the government should step in to
regulate pornography on the Internet, among other related topics.

Censorship, whether it is of a magazine or an Internet address,
is a violation of the First Amendment. The standard for free
"speech was established by the Supreme Court when Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes voiced the clear and present danger stan-
dard. Indeed, no one has the right to yell “Fire” in a crowded the-
ater. But that is where any limitations must stop.

Internet communication is no different than any other form of
speech. It deserves just as much protection as does any other
form of spoken or printed communication. Pornography, while it
might be considered offensive, does not hurt anyone; it doesn’t
even threaten anyone (except maybe their personal sense of
decency). ‘

Pornography on the Internet should no more be censored than
it is in print. If you have ever been at a newsstand, you know that
you can see almost anything in some of the adult magazines. You
can see the same things on the Internet if you are so inclined.

Those who seek to have pornography censored on the Internet

’ are those who find the naked body offensive. That is their pre-

rogative; no one can make them feel comfortable with the human
body. And in the same way, no one can make them look at
pornographic material. It is their right not to look at it.

But equally the same is anyone else’s right to look at as much
pornography as he or she wants to. Censorship is wrong, in any
form, whether it is of political beliefs or nudity. If you don’t like
it, don’t open the book, or don’t dial up that address. But stay out
of other people’s lives.

...and so does apathy

If you aren’t from around here, -you might not keep up on local
politics. If you don’t, you may not even know that today is elec-
tion day, when Allegheny County will elect its new county com-
missioners (among other things).

It is common for college students, especially those who aren’t
from this area, to skip local elections. “I’m not even going to be
here, so why should I care what happens next year?” This kind of
apathy is what gives students a bad reputation.

It doesn’t matter where you are from or where you may be
going next year, you are here now. A part of your life has been in
this area, and you owe it to the community to vote. Not only is it
a responsibility to the community, it is a responsibility to those
who will take our places here once we are gone.

Armey’s ﬂattax falls ﬂat on its face

Michael urrently"
Berquist t h e
Republi

can Party has been seized by the
ﬂat tax fever. Republican House
Majority Leader Richard
Armey of Texas has offered a
ﬂat tax proposal that would, in
theory, change America’s tax
system for the better. While
Congressman Armey’s ideas
are certainly high—minded, they
would do little but make a bad
situation even worse than it
already is.

The idea of the ﬂat tax is that
every American citizen’s tax
bill would be identical: no
exemptions, no deductions, no
tax credits. Congressman
Armey’s plan would institute a
17 percent tax on all wages,
pensions and salaries, and
ignore that area of investments
which is where most
wealthy Americans keep their
money. For example: individu-
als with a $50,000 salary would
pay 17 percent of their salary in
taxes, whereas individuals with
a $40,000 salary and $10,000 in
investments would pay 17 per-
cent of their $40,000 salary in
taxes, but their investments
would remain untouched. That
would torpedo the very objec-
tive of the ﬂat tax from the very
beginning: to make the tax sys-
tem fair to every American, rich
or poor. The wealthy would be
able to hire accountants to hide
their money in lucrative finan-
cial deals, while the middle
class would again be stuck with
paying more than their fair
share.

Congressman Armey has also
called for eliminating all
income tax deductions. This
may sound like a good’ idea at
first glance, but it isn’t. If all tax
deductions are eliminated, then
the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which enables many poor peo-
ple to pull themselves up to the
poverty line, would be gone.
Former president and conserva-
tive icon Ronald Reagan once
called the EITC “the best anti-

poverty, best pro—family, best‘
job-creation measure to come
out of Congress.” Professor
Richard Nathan of the State
University of New York at
Albany said of the EITC: “It’s
got a strong pro-work, work-
incentive character.” Since
Republican President Gerald
Ford signed the EITC into law
in 1975, it has received broad,
bipartisan support.

However, in an effort to make
up for the money that their tax
cuts will rob the Federal
Treasury, the Republicans have
resorted to gimmicks and half-
truths in an effort to avoid being
perceived as raising taxes on
the poor to pay for a tax cut to
the wealthy. Sen. Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania curi-
ously assailed the EITC, saying,
“I do not know how you can
say that it is a tax increase if 90
percent of the people receiving
this money do not pay taxes.”
Senator Santorum, an ambitious
politician never known for
keeping his facts straight, failed
to mention that while 90 per-
cent of all recipients do get an
IRS tax refund, it is usually less
than their tax bill. The
Congressional Budget Office
estimates that if the EITC were
eliminated, 18 million of the
poorest Americans will have
their taxes increased. This
would do little but condemn the
poor to a life of poverty.

Congressman Armey has
claimed that his plan would cost
the government only about $40
billion a year in lost revenue.
However, nearly every expert
that has examined
Congressman Armey’s plan has
declared that it would cost the
government between $160 to
$200 billion a year. The
Treasury department reports
that a flat tax of 26 percent
would be needed to make sure
that the tax would be revenue
neutral, as Congressman Armey
has claimed it is. In addition,
state and local governments will
also receive a jolt from Armey’s

plan to eliminate the special tax
treatment that they receive on
their bonds. These bonds could
lose up to 30 percent of their
value, wreaking havoc upon
municipalities and city govem-
ments that already have diffi-
culty making ends meet. The
effect of this lost revenue will
be tremendously harmful to all
levels of government — local,
state and federal — and to
America’s economy as a whole.
With a ﬂat tax the government
would either be forced to levy
taxes upon the already econom-
ically embattled middle class,
which is political suicide, or gut
the federal budget. Considering
the fact that Congress lacks the
spine to raise taxes, perhaps
Congressman Armey is cynical-
ly making sure that the budget
will be sliced even further than
it has been already.

The flat tax is a bad idea
whose time should never come.
While Congressman Armey’s
plan would make a system
already stacked against the mid-
dle class even more unfair.
Armey’s ﬂat tax would force
the IRS to hire a legion of
bureaucrats, and it would
increase taxes on people who
already find it hard to make
ends meet. I had been under the
impression that the Republicans
had wanted to get the govern-
ment off our backs. Judging
from the effects

would have, I guess that it
wasn't the real problem after

‘all. Like with the balanced bud-

get amendment, the line-item
veto and term limits. the ﬂat tax
is the typical, simplistic,
McG0vernment-style solution
that the Republicans always
seem to peddle to the American

public. Congress ought to over- 
haul America’s tax code to V‘
make sure that the average A

American has the same oppor-
tunity to advance themselves as
does a millionaire.

that‘
Congressman Armey’s plan.

week, I have discovered
several interesting things about
the Greek system here at the
Ivory Towers of Pitt. That edito-
rial garnered possibly the most
heated response to an editorial
this year, with only a few others
coming close. A number of
those responses are printed in
today’s paper, and some of them
aren’t. (I would have needed
almost a whole paper to print
them all.)

It would seem that the offend-
ing editorial broke one of the 10
commandments of university
life: Thou shalt not criticize the
Greek system. I had always
known that fraternities and
sororities were considered
sacred around here, but I hadn’t
realized that the offending piece
almost merited cruciﬁxion. Well,

- get out your crosses, because

this should seal it.

The day after the editorial was
printed, someone made the sug-
gestion that the paper should run
an article about a car wash one
of the Greek houses was hold-
ing. “Since The Pitt News is
obviously anti—Greek ...” we
should play up the good things
the Greeks do around here. Yes,
wouldn’t that be peachy? We
could run a play—by-play of what
happens, from hosing down the
cars to final buffing. And then
maybe we could run a follow-up
about how clean all the cars
were. But wait, even better, we
could do a two-page spread

(complete with photos) about
how the Greeks banded together
to save a poor little squirrel from
certain death.

Then there was the article in
yesterday’s paper concerning
last week’s blood drive spon-
sored by the Greeks. James
Sanders, chair of Greek Week,
said, “It’s a great philanthropic
event as a whole.” Why yes, it is
indeed! And how convenient,
Mr. Sanders, that you have this
perfect opportunity to make your
claims to philanthropy in print
only days after the ZBT stunt. In
the same article, Sigma Delta
Tau member Arlene Chan
played up her philanthropic
nature: “I donated three times
last year at the Greek Week
blood drives.” Thank you, Ms.
Chan, that is truly generous.
Blood donation really is a good
thing, it saves a lot of lives. But
if the people who donate blood
for Greek Week were concerned
about anything more than their
respective house winning, they
would donate blood a lot more
often than three times a year.
You can safely give blood every
56 days — not just three times a
year.

On to the letters. One letter,
conspicuously (and rather cow-
ardly) left anonymous, claimed
that “although we fully acknowl-
edge your right to free speech,
this right does not have to
encompass your smug commen-
tary on a serious campus issue.”
Hmm, apparently sarcasm is not
covered by the First

Amendment. I would like to
suggest that sarcasm was the
only appropriate form of speech
for referring to the idiocy that
went on at this campus last
week. The only alternative
would have been obscene ranti-
ng and raving.

Another letter we received
claimed that the Greeks are the
only ones who do anything posi-
tive for this campus. They “are
the leaders of your Student
Government Board and your
most prominent student organi-
zations.” That attitude might
explain why some Greeks
approached Anil Mehta (this
year’s Homecoming King) and
asked him if he was enjoying the
farce he was making out of a
[insert “Greek” here] tradition.
How dare he not be Greek and
win Homecoming?! This state-
ment makes me wonder, though,
what is it that any of the non-
Greek organizations do? Should
we (including this paper) bow
down and worship the Greek
gods for allowing us to exist in

The brothers of Zeta Beta
Tau at the University of

I Pittsburgh would like to send a

most sincere apology to all
parties that have been affected
by the inexcusable event that
took place in Litchfield Tower
B on Saturday [Oct. 28]. In
particular, this apology is sent
to the young women that did
absolutely nothing and yet
have had to endure‘ this inci-
dent. The fraternity as a whole
does not promote nor approve
of this activity. The brother
event that was held was never
intended to include criminal
activity nor harm to anybody.
Unfortunately, there was not a
clear understanding by the
people that were participating
in the event and some partici-
pants took it to extremes. We
would like to stress that these
individuals were in no way
forced by the fraternity to act
in this manner. Nationally and
at this chapter, Zeta Beta Tau
is a non-pledging fraternity

« where newly initiated mem-

bers are extended the same
rights as any other brother.
There was never the intent to
take photographs of women in
this manner, rather only to

' retrieve a picture (i.e. maga-
. zine, poster, etc.). We realize

that this is not an excuse of
any form and furthermore does
not validate the actions of
some individuals. Being a fra-
ternity, we acknowledge that
the actions of any of our mem-
bers, regardless of how few,
reflect our entire organization.
We are prepared to accept the
appropriate punishment for our
connection in the incident, and
cooperate with all parties in
order for the proper investiga-
tion to take place.

Stephen J. Rosenthal
President, Zeta Beta Tau
Fraternity

The continued criticism of
the university Greeks on the
basis of an isolated incident,
itself entirely unacceptable, is
threatening the existence of
one of Pitt’s most precious
resources. The fraternity men
and sorority women on this
campus are essential to its
vitality. Last week’s unfortu-
nate and disgusting event
involving the ZBT house was
a singular and uncharacteristi-
cally inexcusable action of one
of dozens of Greek organiza-
tions. However, this paper’s
publishing of an editorial that
was suggestive of a ﬂaw with-
in the entire Greek community
was simply unprofessional.

The primary basis of a news-
paper is to inform, not to
manipulate, particularly of a
newspaper which is run with
student funds. The Pitt News
should not be an instrument of
the anti—Greek minority to crit-

icize organizations that raised
over $100,000 for charity last
year. As long as The Pitt News
continues to perpetuate these
unreasonable voices, the uni-
versity Greek system will
remain in jeopardy. Along
with that system will be the
productivity that it provides —
charity for the community, a
structured and loyal alumni
and all of the other benefits of
fraternal organizations.

At yet another disheartening,
disappointing football game,
the frustration of the student
body was evident, but it has
now spread to and is targeting
an undeserving body of the
university — that of the Pitt
Marching Band. While we are
accustomed to the occasional
jeer and being labeled “band
geeks,” the treatment we were

our nothingness? Or should we
just stop meeting since none of
us do anything positive for the
university?

I would like to state here, in
answer to another letter we
received, that the editorial was
on the opinions page, and was
not offered as news. The story
on the front page covered that.
One letter said that “the primary
basis of a newspaper is to
inform, not to manipulate.” The
Pitt News did inform, in the
cover story. The editorial that
proved so offensive was the
majority opinion of the editorial
board; as such, (forgive the
seeming childishness here) we
can say anything we want to. So
there.

Finally, I come to a letter writ-
ten by a brother of ZBT. It was
probably one of the more sincere
and reasonable ones in its apolo-
gy for what happened and its
acceptance of responsibility. The
brother who wrote was not one
of the three who. took the pic-
tures, but he was willing to stand
beside his brothers and share
responsibility. Unfortunately, we
were asked by the president of
ZBT not to print the letter, since
it was not the “official” response
to the incident.

The “official” response, print-
ed below, makes an interesting
point. The author has attempted,
in a very un-brotherly sort of
way, to separate himself and his
fraternity from the actions of the
three boys who were arrested. 1
was always under the impression

subjected to at the Miami
game, by our own student
body, was nothing short of a
disgrace.

Five times a week we brave
the elements and pressures
from our classes to practice
and perfect our halftime show.
Each game day we applaud,
cheer and play for ourteam
with unflagging enthusiasm.
It’s just as frustrating for us to
watch them lose as it is for the
students who turn out, perhaps
even more so because no mat-
ter how bad it gets, we can’t
leave. We’re there until the bit-
ter end providing encourage-
ment and support to a team in
desperate need of it.

The weekend of the Miami
game we were victims of jeers,
taunts and insults —— not from
Miami fans, but from our own
student body. Marching around
the track to perform during
halftime,. fans leaning over the
railing mocked us — Pitt fans.
Throughout the second half,
while in the stands, we were
told to sit down and shut up,
that we were an annoyance to
those students trying to watch
the game — Pitt students. At
the close of the game, a glass
bottle was thrown at our sec-
tion, landing just above us,
shattering glass and juice
everywhere. Luckily no one
was hurt, but the “what if ...?”
looms large. Police were
forced to come up and ques-
tion those few students —— Pitt
students -— who were left. I

that brotherhood in a fraternity
was thicker than thieves, but Mr.
Rosenthal clearly states that this
is not the case. The boys who
took the pictures are referred to
as individuals or people or par-

ticipants, but never brothers. ’

Why not? What happened to fra-
ternity loyalty?

I think fraternities and sorori-
ties might have been a good
thing at one time. But I also
believe they have grown far
away from the original tenets of
brotherhood or sisterhood. I
think it is admirable that the
Greeks do participate in philan-
thropic deeds every now and
then, but I also believe that if
they didn’t they would have
been kicked out a long time ago.
Too many incidents have hap-
pened lately involving Greeks:
sexual assault, stealing grave-
stones, alcohol-related death and
now ZBT’s latest stunt. No
amount of good deeds even
begins to excuse this behavior.

So please, when you are writ-
ing your angry responses to this
column, spare me the list of
what your most recent good
deed was. I don’t really care.
The only good deed you could
possibly do is put an end to these
asinine stunts that end in some-
one getting hurt, or get the hell
off this campus.

fact that we need police pro-
tection from our own fans.

It is pathetic when we are
the visiting band at Boston
College and their fans stay
after the game to listen to us,
yelling, “Good job!” and we
can’t sit through a game at our
own stadium without having
things thrown at us. Miami
fans yelled at some of us after
Homecoming, telling us what
a great band we have. Johnny
Majors himself came to a prac-
tice one evening to express his
thanks for our support and to
applaud us for outstanding
efforts. I’m not asking for a
gold medal for what a great
job the band does; the band
never asks for anything — no
scholarships, no awards, no
compensation except
respect. With our national
champion Golden Girls, a
drumline that is unparalleled in
the Big East, a fantastic col-
orguard and the finest instru-
mentalists from all over, we
deserve respect. Can you hon-
estly imagine a football game
without the “Pitt Victory
Song” and Coach Majors’
favorite, “Hail to Pitt?” With
only one game left in my
career at Pitt, I would like to
enjoy it with the student body,
not against them.

Volleyball escapes
with weekend sweep

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers sent
their seniors off in good
fashion this weekend as they
won their last two home
matches of the season over
Georgetown and Villanova.

It only took Pitt a little
over an hour to dispose of
Georgetown Friday night at
the Field House. The Lady
Panthers swept the Lady
Hoyas in three straight
games by the score of 15-11,
15-10 and 15-6.

Big East Player of the
Week Jennie Driscoll led the
Lady Panthers with 14 kills
and a .440 hitting percent-
age. Sarah Mikla added 10
kills and hit .348, while Sara
Mitchell chipped in with
nine kills.

Georgetown’s Danielle
Stannard had eight kills in
the loss. The Lady Hoyas
committed 22 errors com-
pared to Pitt’s 16.

Pitt won its ‘seventh Big
East match in eight attempts
and raised its overall record

Determination pays off for Porter

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

As the Pitt soccer team took the field for
its opening game, junior midfielder Jeff
Porter stood on the sidelines and watched.

Porter, who was named a 1993-’94 Bell
Atlantic Scholar-Athlete, was forced to sim-
ply observe the action unfolding before his
eyes. Today his position was not on the
field, but on the bench.-He would have- no
offensive or defensive duty; he would just
watch.

Porter was a sideline observer for the first
two games of the 1994-’95 season due to an
ankle injury he suffered in a preseason
game. Watching others play his sport was the
hardest thing Porter had to do.

“I couldn’t stand it,” Porter said of his
position on the sideline. Porter didn’t know
it, but watching would not be half as hard as
coming back.

“It drove me crazy. I came back and I
couldn’t do what I wanted to do,” Porter
said. Porter had to face the disappointment
of coming back and not playing like he was
before he was injured.

Determined to work his way back and play
to his full potential, Porter spent a lot of
time training. He didn’t stall his recovery;
instead he tried to hurry it along. Porter said
he should have let his ankle heal more, but

‘he just wanted to play. When Porter returned

to the field, he was a force to be reckoned
with.

By the end of the 1994-95 soccer season,
Porter was Pitt’s fourth leading scorer with
nine points.

Porter’s accomplishments didn’t go unno-
ticed. He was a 1994-95 Bell Atlantic
Scholar-Athlete recipient and a Gillette Big
East Scholar Athlete.

Porter kept going strong clear into the
1995-96 soccer season. The 21-year-old

senior is now one of the captains of the sac-
cer team. .

“I never thought I’d be captain,” Porter
said. “It was cool.”

Pitt soccer coach Joe Luxbacher knew
what he was doing when he picked Porter to
be a captain.

“He’s definitely one of our team leaders,”
Luxbacher said. “He’s a tough, disciplined
key man.”

Porter has been taking his role as captain
seriously. So far this year he has eight points
in 18 games.

“Jeff ’s representative of what we’re look-
ing for,” Luxbacher said.

All this ability didn’t arrive overnight.
Porter has been playing soccer for 15 years.

“I played every sport, but was best at soc-
cer,” Porter said. “I was too small for foot-
ball and not tall enough for basketball.”

Porter played at Penn-Trafford High
School, where he was All-WPIAL his junior
and senior year and was All-State as a
senior. In his senior year, Porter set the
record for most goals in one season with 30.
The record still stands today.

“He was a leader. He led by hard work,”
said Penn-Trafford soccer coach Dave
Paterline. “He pumped up his teammates.”

Porter definitely made his mark on
Paterline and Penn-Trafford.

“He’s determined. He wouldn’t let a bad
situation get him down,” Paterline said. “He
made other players play a little better.”

Coach Paterline knew he lost a good soc-
cer player the day Porter graduated.

“You could rely on him,” Paterline said.
“In a tight game, he would come up with the
big play. He was like the quarterback of the
team.”

According to Paterline, Porter’s greatest
asset on the field is his one-on-one dribbling
ability.

conference.

Sunday, Pitt hosted 16-7
Villanova. Each team had
only one conference loss
coming into the contest, both
coming at the hands of Notre
Dame.

The match went back and
forth as the two teams split
the first four games. Pitt won
the first 15-11 and the third
15-3. Villanova took the sec-
ond and fourth games 15-12
and 15-5. So it was up to a
fifth and deciding game.

This was the sixth time
this ‘season that a Lady
Panther match would be
decided by a fifth game. Pitt
had last four out of the five.
The only five-game win
came on Sept. 2 at George
Washington.

Alvear and Co. turned the
tables on the Lady Wildcats
and won the deciding game,
15-5, but it was not a good
game in Alvear’s eyes.

“Honestly, it was our worst
overall match of the year,”
Alvear said. “It is tough to
feel good about a_five-game
win when you shouldn’t
even be in the match.”

Battling strong

three medals from the
Head of the Occoquan.
The Crew traveled to
Occoquan, Va., to
compete with 40 other

The weather caused
the officials to shorten
the course of the race
by two-tenths of a
mile. “There was a bad
head-wind,” sopho-

Conrad said.

It is not abnormal to
adjust a race’s course
to accommodate the
weather. “I haven’t
seen them do it for
Occoquan before,” '
novice coach Dana

To add to the prob-

“He could protect the ball when he was
challenged,” Paterline said. “He beat players
one-on-one.”

Coaches were not the only ones to notice
Porter’s soccer skills. Porter is respected by
other players as well.

Pitt teammate Mike Dyer knew Porter for
many years through soccer. The two of them
played in the same league outside of high
school. Ironically enough, they’re now team-
mates.

“He’s a good player to play with,” Dyer
said. “Every team needs a good center mid-
fielder, and with Jeff we have that.”

Dyer summed up Porter’s personality on
the field by saying he’s intense, skilled and
hard-working.

Although it all sounds glorious, soccer,
just like everything else, has its drawbacks.

“People don’t realize how much time it
takes,” Porter said. .

As difficult as it gets, it’s never been so
bad that Porter wanted to quit.

“It gets to a point where it’s too much. You
need to take a few days off,” Porter said.
“But I never wanted to quit.”

Currently, Porter is balancing a busy
schedule. The hospital administration major
has 18 credits this semester, so much of his
time is spent in the classroom. Right after

class, it’s straight to the field for soccer
practice. After practice, it’s homework time.
A lot of Porter’s weekends are spent in dif-
ferent cities due to away games. The team is
sometimes gone from 6 a.m. Friday until 11
p.m. Sunday.

With such a hectic schedule, it’s hard to
imagine Porter having any extra time. But,
when he’s not studying or playing soccer, he
enjoys skiing in the winter and golfing in the
summer. He also enjoys playing tennis.

As for the future, Porter hopes to get a
good job in a hospital. Porter hasn’t aban-
doned soccer in his future completely. He
said he-would consider coaching for high
school, but that’s not his major concern right
now.

“I haven’t thought about it,” Porter said
about soccer after college.

Graduating from college is first and fore-
most in Porter’s life. Porter said his biggest
fear was getting out of school and not being
able to find a job.

With Porter’s determination, it’s hard to
imagine him not being successful. If he ever
doubts himself, the words of his coach
should remind him of his capabilities on and
off the field.

Coach Luxbacher said, “Jeff can handle
himself under adversity. He’s the top mid-
fielder I’ve coached since I’ve been at Pitt.”_

The win was the 10th out
of the last 11 matches for
Pitt (l5-8, 8-1). Villanova
dropped to 16-8 overall and
7-2 in the Big East. .

Driscoll supplied the fire-
power for Pitt yet again. The
redshirt junior had a game-
high 23 kills and hit .425.
This match was the last at
the Field House for seniors
Sarah Mikla, Sara Mitchell
and Alyssa Yanik. _

In two matches Driscoll
recorded 37 kills, 14 blocks,
five digs and a .430 hitting
percentage.

“There is not much else
you can say about Jennie.-.
This is the type of year
we’ve all been waiting for
from her,” Alvear said.
“This is her first full healthy
season. Her intensity is
 high, and she’s really rising
to the occasion.”

Setter Stephanie Dufresne
also played well this week-
end, registering 95 assists,

the two matches.

Pitt’s final preparation for
the Big East Tournament
will be next weekend. It
travels to Rutgers Saturday
and Seton Hall Sunday. The
Lady Panthers are 14-2 life-
time against Rutgers and 22-
0 against Seton Hall.

ers noticed a skeg (a part of
the boat that acts as a rud-
der) had broken off the
shell. Pitt crew’s problems
were not as bad as another
school that had its rigger
(which holds the oar in
place) break during the
course, thus causing a rower
to jump into the water.

Improvising became the
action of the day. The crew
did not get all the competi-
tion it expected. “There
were not enough lightweight
teams to race,” Michael
Rhody said.

“In order to ensure that
everyone rowed, we created
a women’s championship
eight crew,” junior Suzzanah
Land, club vice president,
said. To create the crew,
eight rowers who had never
rowed together before com-
peted. They finished fourth.

After finishing the cham-
pionship eight race, the crew
of the women’s heavyweight
four boat, Julie Lambrou,
Katie Holland, Jen Tierney
and Maggie Raviaoli, got in
their four-shell and started
their next race. Land and
Lacey Cluff, who had also
competed in the champi-
onship eight, joined with
their lightweight team, to
compete in the heavyweight
race. Land pushed herself so
hard, rowing 10,000 meters
in a race with rowers from a
different weight class, that
as soon as she finished the
race, she threw up.

The lightweight four boat
finished in fourth place and
received a medal.

“It’s very unusual to have
so many boats — 30 — in a
race, so they gave a fourth
medal,” Land said. “It’s
equally unusual-to have a
lightweight boat do so well
in a heavyweight category.”

The women’s varsity
heavyweight four won the
second bronze medal of the
day.

Continuing the day’s
unorthodox trend, the men
lightweight eight crew actu-
ally beat the Pitt varsity
men’s heavyweight eight
boat that finished eighth.
Originally, the referees seat-
ed the men’s heavyweight
eight in first place, but a
crew from another school
complained.

“We knew another boat
passed us,” Rhody“ said.

So Pitt did notappeal
when first place was taken
away, even though it did not
agree with the 60-second
penalty added onto its fin-
ishing time.

Immediately after finish-
ing that race, Rhody, Jeff
Maurin, Matthew Kowalski
and Mike Burger from the

eight crew got in a four-.

shell and prepared for the
heavyweight four race.
Their coach questioned the
wisdom of rowing in two
consecutive 5,000-meter
races.

“We already paid for it.

We ‘might as well row it,”
Rhody said.

The adrenaline of the race
helped the crew pull through
another course. “Once you
get started, you don’t notice
it,” Rhody said, but a disap-
pointed crew finished in the
middle of the pack, 14th
place out of 31 boats.

The novice men’s eight
also ran into problems. The
referees assigned them a 75-
second penalty because the
boat was late for their start.
The penalty took the boat
out of competition for. any
top placement.

The fact that the novice
women’s crew beat
Carnegie Mellon’s entry in
a race was one of the regat-
ta’s important achieve-
ments.

The victory over the

‘Carnegie Mellon entry will

encourage the team in this
week’s training for the
CarDu Pitt race (a competi-
tion for local Pittsburgh
university novice crews).

Modell is the most hated man in The Mistake

on the Lake. He was advised not to attend

_ Cleveland’s 37-10 loss to the Houston Oilers on

Sunday. While watching that game on NBC, the
chant, “Art Modell can go to Hell” could be
heard easily. Modell’s Cleveland home is under
police protection because of the thousands of
death threats recently received.

To request an application for a move, the
owner must prove that there is a lack of com-
munity and fan support in the city being moved
from, in this case Cleveland.

Now, wait a minute. Being a die-hard Steeler
fan, I hate everything about Cleveland, espe-
cially the Browns.

However, the Browns average over 70,000
fans per home contest. They have the Dawg
Pound, the craziest section of fans since
Franco’s Italian Army. The team is a staple of
the NFL, and it has been since 1950.

When the Browns entered the NFL, they were
supposed to be the laughingstock of the league.
They won the championship that year, and won
the division crown for the next 10 years. They
also won a few more championships over that

span. Otto Graham, Marion Motley and Jim
Brown all played for Cleveland. There can be
no questioning the Browns’ NFL tradition.

Plus, the Browns still win lots of games,
despite a horrible season caused by Andre
Rison — not Vinny Testaverde. They went to
three AFC Championship games during the
1980s and constantly challenged for the play-
offs. The team they field right now is not
deprived of talent, either.

Modell is a blood—sucking, greedy, money
vacuum. He’s robbing a great fan following of
the team they love. Just imagine if Pittsburgh or
Philly lost the Steelers or Eagles. Blood would
be shed, and people would die.

He’s also robbing the NFL of its credibility.
With all the L.A. teams gone, and a couple
more ready to go, the NFL looks like a halfway
shelter. There is no stability, which used to be
the NFL’s trademark, part of what made the
league the most watched and greatest in sports.

Plus, as a Steeler fan, what will become of
the great Stee1ers—Browns rivalry? It won’t be
the same beating the Browns at Memorial
Stadium. The rivalry is not the NFL’s oldest,
but the greatest. That could be ruined, too.

For once, I agree with the Brown fans, Art
Modell should go to hell.

Mike Kovak is ez columrzistfor The Pitt News
and will hate the Browns wherever they end up.
