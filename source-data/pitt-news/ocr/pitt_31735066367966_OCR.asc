Shared  
Facﬂﬂy

Approved  

Pitt will be paying the interest
on bonds financing the Hospital
Courtyard Shared Services, the
Board of Trustees decided at a
meeting yesterday.

The shared services facility is a
proposed new building to be
jointly used by Children’s Hospi-
tal, Presbyterian Hospital, Eye and
Ear Hospital and Magee Womens
Hospital. .

Last year, Children’s Hospita
purchased property in the court-
yard bounded by Children’s Hospi-
tal, Presbyterian-University
Hospital and Lothrop Hall from.
Pitt to expand hospital facilities.

In the original proposal, the pro-
ject was to be funded by bonds
through the University Health

Center of Pittsburgh——of which

Pitt is a member—so that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh will be the
guarantor for payment of the prin-
cipal interest on the bonds. This
will improve Pitt’s bond rating.

The cost of the facility i&i6.Sti-
mated at $32 million, to be funded
by bonds through Allegheny
County Hospital Development
Authority.

According to the original prop-
osal, Pitt will regain the use of
32,000 square feet of space in
university-owned buildings now
occupied by shared services at no
extra cost. Shared Services would
relocate to a new building.

In other business, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar reported that there
would be a slight decrease in fund-
ing from Harrisburg for the 1984
budget. “Thornburgh will at least

*" Two Convicts With A Clash of Convictions

pit

in.

By PEGGY FERRI P

This Tuesday, two ex-convicts
will meet at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall to debate_personal
freedom—drug culture guru
Timothy Leary and Watergate
sphinx G. Gordon Liddy, who has
been dubbed the “new john
Wayne.”

“The Great Debate." sponsored
by the Pitt Program Council, con-
cerns the conflict of personal free-
dom versus the right of the state.

According to PPC Liddy-Leary
debate chairperson Bob Warm-‘
kessel, tickets have already been
claimed, 100 of which were s()ld to
persons outside of the universitv at

the $2.50 admission price. Last
term's Walter Mondale lecture
drew only a total of 350 students.

According to Warmkessel, Liddy
is being paid a ballpark figure of
$4,000, however, there are
problems.

On September 8, federal prosecu-
tors obtained a court order to seize
Liddy’s book, movie and lecture

- profits. In 1973, as punishment for

his role in the Watergate burglary,
Liddy was charged with a $40,000
fine. He still owes the government
$23,812. His lecture lee will be held
accordingly, l)ut the details of the
procedureare not yet tlear.

Liddy and Leary have debated
together before on other campuses.
Accordingto reviews and a recent
interview on the Donahue show.

the debate is consistently well
received. The debate is a draw
primarily because of the exchange
of personal philosophies between
two obviously different individu-
als. The September 3, 1981 New
York Times likens the event to a
boxing match with Leary wearing
psychedelic trunks in one corner
and Liddy wearing the red, white
and blue in the other.

Most students, however, were
probably engrossed in cartoons at
the time the rest of the nation was
tuned to the Senate Watergate hear-
ings or knew well that Leary advo-
cated spiritual self-discovery
through the use of LSD.

Liddy presided over one of
Lear‘y's many drug arrests in 1966.
Liddy, then Duchess (Jounty assist-

ant district attorney, busted Leary
in a postmidnight raid on Leary’s
borrowed estate in Millbrook, New
York. But Leary is more than a
speaker on psychedelic experi-
ences. .

Leary received his Ph.D. in clini-
cal psychology from the University
of California at Berkeley and was
Phi Beta Kappa. He left a position
at Harvard University in 1963
amidst controversy concerning his
psychedelic research project. He
ran for governor of California in
1969 using the slogan “Come
Together.” He was later convicted
for possession of marijuana.

lle fled prison for political asy-
lum but was later flown back to the
U.S.A. after being kidnapped by
American agents in Afghanistan.

Leary was released on parole in
1976, but only as of August 15,
1981, is he free for the first time.
Liddy is another case entirely.
He is best known as the Watergate
“mastermind”‘ who stayed silent
and served four and a half years in
prison. He received his doctorate in
law and at 29 became one of the
youngest men to serve as an FBI
Bureau supervisor—on the staff of
J. .Edgar Hoover. Liddy is also a
bestselling author, and his autobi-
ography, “Will," recounts, among
other things, his colorful child-
hood attempts to overcome fear by
strapping himself to a tree in a
lightning storm and once baking
and eating a rat. In countless inter-
views, Liddy has repeated that he

admires loyalty and said in a Nov.
7, 1980 Washington Post interview
that he owes this country every
minute of the day.

Liddy and Leary are arriving for
the debate on Tuesday afternoon
and Liddy has indicated to the PPC
that he prefers to be alone before
the debate in order to prepare.
Leary, on A the other hand,
explained in a Sept. 3, 1981 New
York Times interview that» he has
warmed up-for debating Liddy by
debating Moral Majority leaders.

The debate format itself differs
depending on the university
because Liddy and Leary allow the

individual school to decide the for- I

mat to be followed.

According to Bob Warmkessel,
the Pitt debate will last approxi-
mately 45 minutes. Each debater
will present his view and then both
debaters will engage in rebuttals.
Afterwards, a panel of three Pitt
professors (David Gauthier, philo-
sophy; William Smith, English;
Lee Weinberg, administration of
justice) will ask one question indi-
vidually of each debater. Pitt law
professor Tom Gerety will serve as
-the moderator. Finally, there will
be a general question-and-answer
session. 

Warmkessel said this is a good
way to run the debate. He added
that it is also important to involve
the faculty because, for one, it will
help see that Liddy and Leary
won't get by easily making state-
ments without being challenged.

This is Liddy’s second appear-
ance at Pitt and there were some
concerns that this would be too
soon to have him back.

“Liddy was here in l98l,”
Warmkessel explained, “but his
debating Leary is something
entirely different. Besides,” he
added, “there. are new students
since then who haven't seen him.”

Warmkessel said that he feels the
lecture will be an interesting one.
“Both men have a sort of place in
our history,” he said.

SGB Will

Parade

The Student Government Board
unanimously approved a proposal
giving full SGB funding to gover-
nance groups who express an inter-
est in building a homecoming
float. A

‘The funding policy will follow
four stipulations prescribed by the
SGB that governance groups must
follow. Those stipulations are:

0 Groups may have no more
than three floats apiece; ~

0 Groups must have a location
for building the floats;

0 Groups must apply and be
accepted by the Pitt Program
Council to participate in the
parade; -

0 Groups must attend a float
building seminar sponsored by the
PPC.

In other business, the board.’

approvedan amendment to its by-
laws allowing the standing com-
mittees to elect their own officers.
The amendment was proposed last
week by board member Linda»
O’Connor and the board approved
it yesterday.

In the past, the board appointed
chairmen to each of the standing
committees without any‘ input
from the members. The board will
continue to have some say in the
process; however, it will be able to
approve and remove the chairmen.
President Todd DeLuca said this is
a good one for the board.

“I think this is a positive step for
the board because it still holds the
power to approve and remove,” he
said.

Following the resignation of
three chairman from different
standing committees, the board
approved three interim chairmen.
Joe Leah will be the interim Com-
muter Affairs Committee chair-
man and Lisa Carey will chair the
Legal Awareness Committee. The

name of the interim chairman for _

the Academic Affairs Committee
was unavailable. , ' .

The board also approved alloca-
tions of $182.92 for two women
from the Society of Women Engi-
neers to go to Case Western Univer-
sity in Ohio.

ZBT Sanctioned

Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) frater-
nity has been put on probation
by the Interfraternity Council
and will revise its guest policies
because of a fight at its frater-
nity Saturday night.

Fraternity president Barry
Brill said the fight, which
involved hundreds of students
and other fraternity members
who were signed into the party
as friends of a ZBT member.

According to Brill, the guests ,
were harrassing women at the

.n_

ties

party and the things got “out of
control" when they were told to
leave the party.

ZBT decided as a result of the
fight that friends of brothers
will have to be escorted by them
at parties and that no friends
will be signed into rush
functions.

The Interfraternity Council
will keep an eye on  activi-
for an indefinite time

last year,” he said.

Concerning academics, he said a
theater arts department was estab-
lished “with no cost implica-
tions" and a new joint degree pro-
gram is beginning this month in
business and law.

Posvar said that in the first week
of September, 240 new faculty
members were oriented, “which is
an amazing number." lid Clark,
from the Chamber of Commerce,

welcomed the group.

Posvar also announced yester-
day, Rhoten Smith, provost of the
university since 1971, will retire
from that position effective July 1,
1983.

Smith, a political scientist, came

to Pitt from the presidency of

Northern Illinois University, a
post he held from 1967 to l97l. Pre-
viously, he was dean of Temple
University’s College of Liberal
Arts from 1961 to l967. He has also
taught at New York University's
Law School and Graduate School

of Arts and Sciences, the University
of Kansas and the University of
California at Berkeley.

He served as director of the Citi-
zenship Clearinghouse, a national
organization to foster education in
politics for college students. Dur-
ing World War II, Smith flew com-
bat missions as pilot of a B-17

bomber with the Eighth Air Force. A

He holds B.A. and M.A. degrees
from the University of Kansas and
a Ph.D. in political science from
the University of (lalifornia at
Berkeley. ‘

Q

When you look at the way Pitt
students interact with each other,
you're likely to note their separate-
ness, especially when it comes to
race. Black and white fraternities do
not mingle. Students tend to sit in
the cafete n'a according to race. And
many student organizations consist
either only of white or black

\§'st‘udents.

Are student groups at Pitt actu-
ally segregated? If so, what are the
reasons for it and how can it be
changed? This week’s Forum talked
to student leaders and administra-
tors about their views on segrega-
tion in student groups.

He believes programming of carn-
pus events and student media cov-
erage increase the separation. The
student media could do a betterjob
“in terms of getting people
involved," he said.

“If minority students can see that
coverage about things that interest
them is regular, then maybe they
would want to become involved in
media groups."

He said minority students are
"lost in the shufﬂe" when it comes to
the entertainment events on cam-

‘ pus. The Pitt Program Council plans

events that will appeal to the main-
stream of students, he said.

“The Pitt Program Council
should try a little harder to program
more diverse events, even though
they might lose a little money in the
endeavor," Watson said.

Jimmy Gilliland

“We’re not going to do small
things geared toward one group
when there are organizations
already doing it," Gilliland said.

Pitt Program Council occasion-
ally tries to schedule specific pro-
grams for minorities, but it has
found that those programs are gen-
erallyﬁnanically unsuccessful. Gilli-
land said the "overall general
response was poor" to a Chic con-
cert the PPC sponsored last year."

Cross-over acts that will draw
diverse groups of students are one
solution to the prograrnmi‘n_q prob.
lern, Gilliland said, but he noted that
the cost of such acts is often beyond
PPC's means. -

“it's a real tough situation," Gilli-
land said. "It's hard to ﬁnd a good
cross-over act without spending a
lot of money.“

“Segregation In Student Organizations  

It was a good idea and it was
something that was needed,"

Clarke said. “We wanted to be able
to mix the organizations, and we
tried all different ways of trying to
get the word out about it to student
organizations, but ultimately we
found that there was just not
interest."

She said that there is no distinct
line or ofﬁcial rules that segregate
student organizations, but that
segregation exists.

Clarke cited the separate frater-
nity system as one exanple of the
segregations. Pitt's black fratemi-
ties and sororities do not participate
in the school’s Greek Week.

She also said that black students
don't‘often take part in Homecom-
ing either and that student govem-
ment is one of the few area in which
there is little separation.

Clarke blames student leaders for
not taking the initiative in encourag-

This has not yet been done, she
believes, because they (student
leaders) are comfortable where they
are." .

Bruce Rogers
BAS Chairperson’

Bruce Rogers is the chairperson
of the Black Action Society, a stu-
dent organization that serves the
interests of black Pitt students.

"Segregation at the University of
Pittsburgh is a major factor," Rogers
said. It (the university) being so
large, and many people coming from
protective backgrounds tend to stay
around people that they feel most
comfortable with, whether they be
black or white.

Segregation is unquestionably
here on campus, has been, and will
be many years after our deaths.

Less Than

  Civil

The recent trial of several Pittsburgh protesters-
including a Pitt English professor—brought atten-

tion once again to civil disobedience and the.

question of any justification for it.

Professor Liane Norman, who is also a candidate
for the U.S. Senate, was among ll others who
chanted and sang peace songs at a Rockwell In terna-
tional shareholders meeting last February in Pitts-
burgh. They were taken away by Pittsburgh police
officers who were moonlighting as security guards
for Rockwell International. The group was charged
with defiant trespass, disorderly conduct and conspi-
racy, which is a third degree misdemeanor.

All except the disorderly conduct charge, were
dropped, and the entire group was convicted on the
reduced charge. Norman and another protester,
however, appealed this conviction. Their retrial was
held last week, and the judge dropped all charges
against them, saying the case did not warrant arrest.

The central issue in this case was essentially
ignored, due primarily to the legal technicalities.
The question of civil disobedience and its limita-
tions. was really the underlying concern in the trial.

According to Norman, the purpose of her actions
was to draw attention during her trial to her opposi-
tion to, nuclear proliferation and to include in the
trial expert testimony from members of Physicians
for Social Responsibility.

The justification of civil disobedience is, admit-
tedly, one that is slippery and difficult to define in
concrete terms. Norman appealed to the classical
example of the Nuremberg Trials. The Interna-
tional Military Tribunal concluded that interna-
tional law imposes duties and liabilities upon the
individual as well as upon the state. The very essence
of the Nuremberg example is that individuals have
duties that transcend national obligations.

Debates on the subject are likely to grow in
number and intensity as people become more con-
cerned with emotionally volatile issues. The anti-
nuclear movement is such an issue, supported by

middle of the road, God-fearing citizens. They are I

not generally the type to march in the streets, but
that’s what they’re'doing. Last summer's New York
rally in favor of nuclear disarmament drew a record-
breaking international crowd. The Catholic church,
which in the ’50s supported McCarthyism, is speak-
ing out against nuclear stockpiling.
The issue has wide enough appeal. that sooner or
later the participants in the arms race are going to
have to respond or face the wrath of a movement
possibly frustrated enough to make its point. It will
be interesting and enlightening to see then how the
legal system will deal with this whole issue of civil
disobedience.

-Soon, the civil disobedient will no longer be ste-
reotyped as the isolated individual and misguided
idealist. He’ll be your neighbor, your brother or your
local priest—anyone with something to lose.

Hey You In The Toga And Sandals;
Questions From AFamous Reporter

By STEVE PARKS

In this age of double talk, vague
innuendo and repetitive rhetoric,
from the mists of ancient time
comes a man to cut through the
words and into the issues. Socrates,
Greek philosopher, now questions
the decisions and arguments that
leaders make in shaping our
future.

Place: The White House.

I Event: Press Conference.

The room grows quiet as the
President steps behind the podium.
“Well, I’d like to start off with a
brief statement. Since my election,
I have stressed the need to close the
window of vulnerability which
was brought about by the massive
Soviet build-up of arms. To close
this window,II propose an increase
in military spending to make
America the strongest nation in the
world. Now are there any
questions?"

Fifty hands shoot up, Reagan
noticing a hand in the back of the
room, says, “Okay, you in the toga
and sandals?"

“If I might ask one small ques-
tion. Could you explain the reason
for this build-up of arms?”

“Well sir, I thought I explained
that in my statement. The reason is
that it’s necessary to close the win-
dow of vulnerability.”

“Which is?” asks Socrates.

“Eh?” questions Reagan, cup-
ping his hand over his ear.

“What is this window you speak
of?”

“It’s the Soviets’ sense of super-
iority,” Reagan explains.

“So you arecommitting billions
of dollars to destroy a sense of
superiority?”

“Did I say sense of superiority?”
says ashocked Reagan, “I meant to
say superior weaponry.”

“Are their weapons as ‘good’ as
ours?" asks Socrates.

“Well of course not, our wea-
pons are second to none!” announ-
ces Reagan, pounding his fist on
the podium.

“Then if our weapons are ‘bet-

ter,’ we should need Iess_. It seems
we are back to the question: Why

the build-up?”

“Er...Any other questions?” asks »

a confused Reagan.
“You haven't answered mine
yet!” demands Socrates.
“Yeah! Answer Toga-man’s
question!" shouts a reporter.
“The reason, as I said before, is
we have to show the world and
Americans that this government
isn't going to get pushed around,"
Reagan proudly announces.
“So the Soviets are pushing us
around?” _
"Nobody pushes us around! If
they even tried, I'd cut off all our

it

So,” Socrates states, “you can
use technical aid as a weapon."

“Well, I guess...”

“Then why build weapons when
we already have them?”

"‘Well, we have to do some-
thing,” Reagan quips.

Nobody laughs.

“Then do we build weapons to
prove to Americans their
strength?”

“Of course,” exclaims Reagan,
now willing to agree to anything to
get Socrates to be quiet.

“Then all the people want this?”

“I was elected because of this
very issue," says Reagan.

“Or because of your opponent’s
poor performance?"

“Probably a combination of
both,” Reagan slowly concedes.

“Then people voted against him
and not for your stand on this issue.
In fact, haven’t there been protests
against this plan?”

“A couple...”

“Then actually few people sup-
port it."

“But it’s what I feel is best for the
country,” Reagan shouts back.

“What would you call a leader
who ignores popular opinion and
does only what he feels to be best?”

-“Why, that's a dictator!”
answers Reagan, knowing he ans-
wered this one right.

“Then by your own definition,
you are a....” '

At that moment two secret ser-
vice men rush up and drag this con-
fused and obviously mad
individual and usher him from the
room. President Reagan had left
the room, hidden safely behind
closed doors. Reagan was safe, but
are we?

Med School Prob/ems Show No SignsOfAbating

Dear Editor:

In its Aug. 29 article entitled
“Ailing Med School”, The Pitt
News reported that Dean Leon
recently expressed the view that

~ despite the turbulent yearjust past,

he was optimistic about the com-
ing year. Unfortunately, such
optimism is without foundation
and the worsening problems in the
School of Medicine these past five
years show no signs of abating.
The reality is that the medical
school is suffering serious finan-
cial, academic and moral problems
that will not go away unless funda-
mental structural changes take

place in the practice plans that ~

encompass virtually the entire full-
time clinical faculty.

The lucrative practice plans
which last year earned $30 million
to ’ the med school
budget of $18 mi11ion).were created
ostensibly to provide a source of
funds to support academic pro-
grams, including teaching and
research. They were intended to
return substantial revenues earned
by the private practice of the clini-
cal faculty to the medical shcool. At
other institutions which operate
under a single clinical service plan
that is under strong central control
exercised by the dean, these prac-
tice plans have effectively served
this purpose. Such is not the case at
the University of Pittsburgh.

Over the past four years, the clin-
ical faculty of Pitt formed a total of

S 314 individual corporations whose

secret financial arrangements have
created an enormous tangled
monetary web that Leon himself
cannot comprehend or regulate. In
fact, a report from the dean to the
University Senate Subcommittee
on Medical Practice Plans, chaired
by Dr. Richard Pratt, was rejected
in-large measure’ because it was
incomprehensible.

Leon was urged by the commit-
tee members to clarify matters with
a new report. The dean has rejected
this request and to date remains
uncooperative, unwilling or
incapable of informing the aca-
demic community of the true work-
ings of the practice plans. Leon
hopes to suppress the evidence that
practice-derived income has bene-
fited corporate physicians of the
medical school faculty and not aca-
demic programs in the Health Cen-
ter. While Leon stalls and
obfuscates, academic programs
deteriorate further.

Before the creation of faculty cor-
porations in the teaching hospi-
tals, Pitt’s medical school was in a
class with Johns Hopkins, Yale,
Penn and Columbia, schools with
8-l0.year accreditations. Last year
the prestigious Liaison Committee
on Medical Education (LCME)
reduced Pitt’s accreditation to two
years, placing us in a class with- the
10 worst medical schools in the
United States.

A major criticism of the LCME
report was directed at the clinical
practice plans. National Board
(Part I) scores released last week
show a substantial decline in the
performance of Pitt medical stu-
dents. Interestingly, the lowest
score was in the area of pathology.
This prompted Dr. T.]. Gill, chair-
ma_n o_f pathology, to chastise his
faculty members for causing him
this embarrassment. But you may
recall, it was the same Dr". Gill who
last year used $80,000 of practice
plan revenues to purchase an appa-
ratus for his laboratory, while
spending only $3,000 on the
pathology teaching laboratory.

The practice plans have ‘also
undermined the Mortality Confer-
ence, the centerpiece of the pathol-
ogy department’s teaching

Progress Doesn’t Occur

Dear Edi tor:

In a manner much loved in
antiquity by? Cicero and more
recently by former president Car-
ter, Mary Kane has skillfully
loaded her opinion into an issue (if
indeed it really is an issue) and has
attempted to pass off her thoughts
as “objective.” I refer, of course, to
“A Sure Measure of Progress,”
published in the Sept. 15 issue of
The Pitt News.-

In reading this article, I, for one,
was filled with an aching sense of
deja vu. Again, fascistic, dictatorial
university regulations, encourag-
ing oppressive, horribly unroman-

Wade notions (such as providing an

adequate forum for the presenta-
tion of ideas and reasoned debate)
have come under fire by a wizened
idealist. -

Coming forth from the temple of
editorial righteousness in tones
oracular, we are told that such reg-
ulations are “senseless and con-
trary to the purposes of a"
university.” Exactly how or why
the organized discussion of ideas is.
“contrary to the purposes of a u-ni-‘-
versity” was not explained‘, but
why cavil over something inciden-

lajal? The statement very clearly‘

resurrects the long-dead and some-
what sophomoric comparison of
the 19505, characterized as a wholly
glum and smug decade, with the
ideals of social activism, inaccu-
rately equated with the student
movements of the 1960s. Miss
Kaneis utterance is admirably
‘J

L _- _ ,

::r.2From Shoutingand Sit-Ins

adept in this respect, because it
reflects the chief orthodoxy of the
l980s—non-conformist Sixties
worship--and hence marks her as
one of the cognoscenti. Don Quix-
otewould be proud.

‘Certainly, there is some merit to
Miss Kane’s ironic observation that
many current values and attitudes
have evolved along lines that
hardly constitute progress, but
reviving the shrill, hysterical voice
of the 19605 is no less atavistic.
Indeed, a good many intelligent,
sensitive people (such as Miss

Kane) have apparently fallen into
the trap of believing that signifi-
cant, progressive changes in moral
views or public policy can be
brought about by protest marches,
sit-ins and “Rock Against Reagan”
concerts.

, To say that such an opinion is
dangerous would overstate the
case, but it must be acknowledged

« 2 that progress is best brought about
. by an
' exchange of ideas within the agen-

intelligently organized

cies or institutions that have
shaped current conditions. By
denouncing a set of university reg-
ulations that obviously seek to
further this goal, Miss Kane has
unwittingly placed herself in the
position of being labeled as some-
thing other than a proponent of
progress.

Joseph L. DiPietro, Jr.
CAS/Philosoiphy, 1984

program that used to bring nearly
100 residents, medical students and
faculty from the departments of
pathology and medicine together
each week in an atmosphere of
scholarship. It was truly a valuable
and high-quality activity. Unfor-
tunately the Mortality Conference
has deteriorated progressively and
markedly over the past two years.
Dr. Levy, chairman of medicine,
no longer supports the conference
and discourages his colleagues
from participating in it.

Some have charged this is

“The reality is that
the medical school
is suffering serious-
firiaricial, acad€miC

and moral problems.”

because there is money to be made
in the hospital, not in a lecture
room. The :ry at faculty meetings
in departments such as medicine,
psychiatry, obstetrics and gyne-
cology and opthamology is no

longer “scholarship”; it has
become “make. money.” Others
claim that without periodic-,

frequent, and formal collaboration
between the departments of medi-
cine and pathology, such as used to
occur at the Mortality Conference,
the probability is high that the
quality of patient care and the cost
of medicine will be adversely

affected at the Health Center Hos-
pitals.

The deplorable state of the
School of Medicine has been
camouflaged by the chairmen of
the practice plans. Everyone, lay-
men and health professional alike,
who treasures the university medi-
cal school must become involved,
first, in unmasking the problem
and, secondly, in working to return
the institution to its previous pres-
tigious position whereit conscien-
tiously served the interests of the
‘community and the common-‘
wealth. I

Furthermore, if this dangerous
trend continues much longer there
will be no one like the pathologists
serving a check and balance func-
tion in the teaching hospitals. A
thoughtful and knowledgeable
person will appreciate that aca-
demic and moral considerations
cannot be separated. I wonder if
Harvard, Johns Hopkins or other
medical schools among whose
number Pitt’s School of Medicine
proudly ranked in'the pre-practice
plan era (barely four years ago),
have abolished their Mortality
Conferences.

More than one physician has
acknowledged that the number of
misdiagnoses and instances of
unsound patient management has
already increased in the Health
Center as a result of the intense
pressure to earn money for the cor-
porate practice plans. Others fear
that hospital costs at the five hospi-
tals of the Health Center, already
the highest in the city and higher
than at most teaching hospitals
(hospital costs at Presbyterian Uni-
versity Hospital increased 18.3 per-
cent last year), may go even higher.
Why shouldn’t a doctor who bene-
fits directly from a clinical service
plan maximize the number of CAT

scans, pathology lab tests,,consul-
tations and pacemaker implants?

One medical school dean defined
the problem clearly. “With much
of the practice plan money remain-
ing under the control of the depart-
ment, such a resource does little to
strengthen the‘ overall institution,
further fragments the administra-
tive authority of the dean,’ and com-
plicates central planning. Since the
departments have different earning
capacities, there is potential for the
development of a school hardly
structured to deal with teaching
and research needsof the institu-
tion and‘ society. Political power
within the faculty can also be
adversely distributed. It is not easy
to convince faculties to share the
wealth.”

Sadly, these things have come to
pass at Pitt. The 14 secret and
separate practice plans have
brought out the primitive territor-
ial instincts of man“. Each chair-
man of a practice plan feels that
because he has earned the money, it
is his to use as he sees fit and damn
the university, full speed ahead. In
so doing, they have destroyed any
coherent, unifying and purposeful
sense of community in the School
of Medicine; instead, a state of sub-
lime anarchy prevails.

It is appropriate to close with
these thoughts: Sir Thomas
Browne-—“No one should
approach the temple of science
with the goal ofa money-changer,”
and Dr. William Osler—“Doctors
who make financial gain the first
object of their work should beheld
in contempt."

I urge the entire faculty and stu-
dent body to become involvedin
this debate. A good way to begin
would be by testifying before
Pratt’s committee. a

Religious Crusader inconsiderate

Dear Editor:

I am a second term freshman
enrolled full-time in the College of
Arts ‘and Sciences. On the after-
noon of Sept. 14, I was taking a

class was subjected to the unrea-

Litter
Warning  

Dear Editor:

Given all the problems that face
our society, my complaint may
seem picayune. It concerns litter-
ing. What is most disturbing about
people’s depositing unwanted
materials in the environment is not
the gradiose scale upon which it is
done—it’s the casual indifference
in the attitude of people, them-
selves. I see this as symptomatic of
something much deeper than the
littering act itself: individuals have
lost their sense of connectedness or

relatedness to‘ the environment.

It may serveius..-welel to recall that
animals are careful not to contami-
nate their environment. Perhaps
this helps explain why they have
been around for hundreds of mil-
lions of years. Man, whose folly
may be equal to his wisdom,
should consider this, especially
when littering becomes so habitual
that it is accompanied by neither
thought nor awareness.

After class, I went outside and
asked the cross-bearing gentleman
to loweruhis voice to a more toler-

The Plight of Uganda

Dear Editor:

While the atrocities committed
in Uganda by the government of
Idi Amin were well known and
often reported by the news media,
very little mention has been made
of the massive violations of human
rights now being committed in
that country under President
Obote.

Extrajudicial killings, torture,
illegal detentions by the army and
mass arrests of civilians and politi-
cal opponents by the army and the
government are common occurren-

HWRHINLS P
by Charles Simmons
Bantam Books

Wrinkles are what you get when
you read this book, as you furrow
your brow in perplexity searching (in
vain) to discern the plot. The book is
comprised of 44 chapters, each a sub-
plot in itself. Basically, there is no
character development, although the
writer serves as the main character,

y the silent observer, telling the stories

from an omniscient point of view.
Each chapter (if two pages of manus-
cript constitutes a formal chapter) is
short, yet concise, with information
leading to the overall text. Wrinkles
,could be referred to as an autobio-
graphy, since the writer's entire span
of life is revealed (even to the most
sordid details) from infancy to old
age. If a main text, or series of themes
could be derived from this book,'it

Cold ‘War era in American politics,

 
   

en=..’”‘”‘“‘§s.‘. 

influenced by "the present day hot-

.:ting up of the cold war...”

That's what this book is alright-—
America shocked by vulnerability of
nuclear holocaust. But it's funny.

REALLY funny. These jokers actu-

ally thought we could survive attack.
The work is presented in the real life
pictures with which Civil Defense
conducted its campaign. Remember
Burt the Turtle in his civil defense
helmet, asking, ”Remember what to
do, friends. Now tell me—what do
you do when you see the flash?
DUCK AND COVER!"

” ‘The book is nicely composed of

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 

 
     

trash such as Burt and the Boy Scouts
armed for war, as well as priestswurg-V
ing the men of the family to be pre-
pared to fight, even to kill to protect
their families from the communists

A in case of nuclear attack, all juxta-

posed with the sobering realities of

A Hiroshima.

But while the text is a study in
American propaganda in the extreme
(“And thus the natives express to the‘
people of the United States their wel-
come, despite the fact that the atoll of
Bikini may be utterly destroyed come
July the first.”), it is also a look at a
nation terrified by its own evil and

 

power, and perhaps, shaken for the
first time by the realization that the

United States was open to attack, and y

if she, the goddess of ‘good of the
world, could unleash such forces
upon Japan, why then, anyone could
unleash such forces upon her.

This is a great book to read any-
thing into. While it loses a lot without
theimovie, it's clever to look at and
clever to laugh at, realizing what sort
of rednecks we all come from.

would center on sex, marriage,
racism, religion, urination, mastur-
bation and death.

Simmons tends to confuse with his
style, usually beginning the first part
of the chapter with the past tense, or
flashbacks, then ending with a fore-
shadowing of future events. Once
you get into this book, each chapter
holds a fascination because even
though the variety of,» themes are
rather mundane, they are conveyed
in a refreshing and blatantly honest
manner. There are no niceties in this

novel, however, and the reader is
never shielded from what could be
termed as vulgar realities.

The writer portrays himself as a
young boy growing up and entering

_school, going to college, entering the
army, getting married, having child-.

ren and growing old. However,
unlike a formal progression of events
usually told in’ chronological order,
each chapter jumps’ at random to dif-
ferent periods of time in the writer's
life. There is no continuity of theme,
yet the transition between chapters is
delightfullysimple. The subject mat-

"centrate heavily on the philosophies

, easy to read. If you're one of those

science, this is definitely the book for

J ’*
ter is generally uncomplicated,
although the writer does tend to con-

and variations of different religions.
He also focuses on his morbid obses-
sion/fascination with death. The sex
scenes in this book,(which surrepti-
tiously appear in almost every other
chapter) usually deal with sadism and
homosexuality, with little attention
centered on a ”normal" sex life within
his marriage.

Because of his unique literary style,
Simmons has created a piece of work
that is hard to follow, yet incredibly

one chapter of a book before retiring

What a piece of work a computer is.

Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Soul

however, the computer industry had

LIDING——that’s Peligrino." So
read the posters for Legendlll,
performed last Sunday and next
at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers
Co-op in Oakland. It's good ad
copy, but the work’ of writer-
actor-singer-musician Steve
Pelligrino just doesn't live up to
it.
Okay, I know. I can hear the
typewriters of Pelligrino's fol-
lowing (and it is a substantial
one) pounding out nasty letters
to me already. I'm not saying
Pelligrino isn't talented.) He is.
Very. He is a magnetic actor, a
fine musician (and a courageous
one, since he insists on playing
the accordion) and a singer with
a unique style fused from equal
parts of Broadway and good ole
rock ’n’ roll. But Legend III is

simply self-indulgent, a one-
man show that talks of nothing
but its author-performer’s fail-
ure to obtain grants and
national recognition as an
artist. If you're an artist, you're
in the same fix, so you don't

" care. If you're not, you just

don't care, either.

Legend III concerns the adven-
tures of Nito Vito, an "ethnic"
born with a rare disease which
has caused an accordion to grow
out of his chest. Billed as a piece
of performance art, it simply
isn't (except for about five min-
utes worth, which is spectacu-
lar). Rather, Legend III is a
combination of standup comedy
-and one-man musical theatre.

Parts of Legend lll work very,
very well, indeed. Pelligrino
has a fine sense of theatre and
the performance talent to make
it work. His "I Dance a Tango”

is archly satiric and performed
with verve and imagination.
His opening speech is delivered
in the blackout, and the
audience hangs on every word
delivered in Pelligrino's richly-
modulated, finely trained voice.

But parts of Legend III are

simply boring. Boring because .

they're cliches, as in the actor-
agent bits and the talk show
satire (boy, am I sick of talk
show satires). More often,
they're boring because they are
solipsistic tirades aimed at
those responsible for keeping
Pelligrino in obscurity.

What is most frustrating
about all this is that Pelligrino
should be as good as he keeps
telling us he is. Two sequences
in Legend III prove this. In the
talk show scene, the host
(played, of course, by Pelli-
grino) asks Nito Vito to per-

form some of his work for the
cameras. Pelligrino methodi-
cally slips on a pair of strange
cut-out evening gloves. He con-
nects two batteries, and small
green bulbs light up, his palms
acting as reflectors. The stage
lights are blacked out, and Pel-
ligrino goes into an a cappella
song and dance which is simply
startling. With a cinema screen
as a backdrop, Pelligrino bril-
liantly manipulates his built in
lighting, casting provocative
green shapes on the screen
behind him that frame him as.
he dances or using the lights to
create an unearthly focus on his
face or body. He follows this
piece with an equally effective
song called ”Theatre Cowboy,”
and I won't spoil it for you by
describing it.

When Pelligrino focuses his
superb talents on a subject
more interesting than his own
professional problems, he prob-
ably will obtain the recognition
he longs for in his current piece.
Legend III will be presented again
this Sunday, September 19, at
8:00 p.m., at the Pittsburgh
I-‘ilmmaker's Co-op on Oakland
Avenue. Admission is an
absurdly reasonable $2, and
information about upcoming
films and performances is avail-
able at 681-5449.

while most popular computers are

based on a byteulength of 16 bits, by

1978, DEC had introduced a 32-bit
”supermini" called the VAX.

Soul relates the story of how Data
General designed and built their own
32-bit minicomputer, the Eagle, in an
amazingly short period of time. To
those who, like myself, always sus-
pected that the design and building of
a computer was a lengthy, carefully
planned process, much of this book
may come as a surprise.

The construction of Eagle was
guided as much by the young engi-
neers recruited fresh from college as

it was by the corporate objectives of‘

Data General upper-level manage-
ment.

This book is a fascinating study of
exactly how a major task, like the
building of a computer, is actually
accomplished, told with insight and a
real feel for the environment in

NIGHT AND DAY
Joe Jackson
A&M

Witness the evolution of Joe
Jackson——‘man of a thousand
musical influences. Breaking
onto the scene in '79, Jackson
screamed for attention with his
classical, scathing Look Sharp,
that rocked as much as it
mocked. His follow-up effort,
I'm The Man, although not as
‘honed, also moved in the same
vein. However, with culmina-
tion of these two releases, Joe
Jackson's rock-n—roll larval
stage had ended. His next two
releases, Beat Crazy and ]umpin'
Jive, proved to be two excellent
albums (though most critics
didn't feel that way) that delved
into two ' different musical
genres. Beat Crazy was Jackson a
lareggaelska, while ]ampin' Jive

IQE JACKSON

messed around~with albunch of
old swing and scat tunes. It was
different, but it was real good.
Now, with the release of Night
and Day, the metamorphosis has
reached another stage. This
album reeks with the smell and
flavor of New York City while
taking on a more mellow and
subtle approach. Jackson has
captured the feelof the Man-
hattan clubs along with the
sounds and livelihoodof the Big
Apple. The swing influence is
still evident on Night and Day, but
it's more of an original effort
with Jackson writing most of
the lyrics and music. The album
consists of a ”Night Side” which
contains the faster, more dance-
able pieces, and a "Day Side,"
which harbors the majority of
‘the slower, moodier pieces.
Just as he was denied the
credit he deserved for Beat Crazy
and Jampin’ Jive, so Joe Jackson's
Night and Day will almost cer-
tainly be given the same dis-
courtesy. Nonetheless, don't
write JJ off. This is an excellent
album by a man who seems to
find consistency in change. Jack-
son says it best in "A Slow
'S0ng": "I'm open to change my mood
but/ I always get caught in the mid-
dle." ’Nuff said.

NOTHING TO FEAR
Oingo’Boingo
I.R.S.

”...and checking in at #152 on
Billboard's chart this week is
Oingo Boingo...." Oingo
Boingo??!? What's this country
coming to? A decent band that
even gets its record in the top-
200--hard to believe, isn't it?
Maybe this odd practice will
even become a, gaspl, trend.

Nothing To Fear is an unusual
album, but if you listen to it
often enough, you'll find your-
self getting very attached to it,
even going so far as to refuse
your best friend when he asks to
borrow it simply because you
must hear "Wild Sex (In The
Working Class)" or "Reptiles
and Samurai" hourly.

Oingo Boingo, who did a tour
a while back with the Police, are
bizarre in that they manage to
convey everyday fears with
great musical arrangement and
vocals that sound something
like The Three Stooges on
Mars. Which isn't to say that
they're so weird that they're
inaccessible; Oingo Boingo_ do
know how to put together a nice
song, as evidenced ‘here. But,
don't kid yourself, for you defi-
nitely won't hear any of their
material on most radio stations
‘(I'm sure DVE et al. have never
heard of them, and once they
did, they'd be sure to never play
one of the cuts, unless, of
course, someone stuck a Rush
label on Nothing To Fear), and I'm
sure Pete Bishop won't review
them (which is reason in itself to
buy this).

So, if you're sick of feeling like
another piece of ”gray matter,"
who's just "running on a tread-
mill," then have no fear———Oingo
Boingo will make it seem like
fun.

MONEY TALKS
Trooper

RCA A
A few years back, this Cana-

dian quintet grabbed my atten-
tion with their AOR hit "Raise

A Little Hell." Its parent album,’

Thick /is Thieves wasn't fantastic,
but it did exhibit the wild energy
the band possessed. Now, after
going without hearing anything
new by Trooper for years,
Money Talks falls into my hands.

The interim period . has
brought on maturation,
whether or not that's good, I'm
not sure. Money is mostly power
pop (there are a few ballads) as
was Thieves, but the energy has
been harnessed and domesti-
cated. .

The best cuts from‘ the album
are "Any Minute Now," "Ready
For The Night" and "Only A
Pool." This last song is one of
the previously mentioned bal-
lads and a very good tune; it is
slow—paced but laced with intri-
cate, power-guitar licks.

Money Talks is not worth $7, or
even $6, but if you find _a used

CHRONIC TOWN
R.E.M. i
1.11.5.

OK, here's a southern-based,
techno—rock band that, believe it
or not, sounds like a cross
between U-2 and the Byrds.
Well, gee, that's unique, but
unfortunately this five-song EP
isn't. Somehow, R.E.M. has
found a way to record the same
song five times with only subtle
variations in rhythm and lyrics.
The only thing R.E.M. ‘accom-
plishes here is to get more
money for an EP instead of a
single. , -

By the time the last two songs
roll around, "Gardening At
Night," and "Carnival of Sorts
(Box Cars)," the band has pretty

‘ much perfected their technique

which really isn't too bad. These
two songs and only these two-
shoud have been released on a
45 disc. That's all.

BLACK TIGER

Before I start this review, let

me say that I do like heavy

accused of being a punk who-

Now, let me say that Y&T is
an English heavy metal band;
then let me say that Black Tigeris
awful! None of the songs really
sound original, they all sound
like songs done by groups such

as Black Sabbath, AC/DC and

early Uriah Heep (not to men-
tion scores of others). The
musicians are either very poor,

or they don't record well; it is so
bad you'll want to remove the
record from the turntable after
the first song (which you can do,

but I had to endure)-

To close, I'd like to say that if .

this is the future of heavy metal,
it should be shot in the head
now instead of suffering a slow
merciless death at the hands of

groups like Y&T.

CATHOLIC GIRLS

CATHOLIC GIRLS
Catholic Girls
MCA

When I first saw this album's
cover, I groaned. Here's yet
another all—girl band trying to
look both tough and vulnerable,

» not only are they called Catholic

Girls (oh, goshl), but they're all
decked out in school uniforms-
short skirts,_ kneesocks, white

’ shirts, ties and baby doll patent

leather shoes. Aaarrgh! After
letting it collect dust for several
days, I finally decided to pluck
up my courage and listen to it,
sure that I'd hate it thoroughly
and, at least, enjoy writing a
nasty review. So, I put side one
on theturntable, poised my poi-
son pen, and...suffered_ mild
shock. This record isn't half-

bad. To be truthful, it's really.

good.

Catholic Girls consists of four)
people: Joanne Holland (bass),
Roxy Andersen (lead guitar),
Doreen Holmes (drums) and
Gail Petersen (lead vocalist,
-rhythm guitar). Petersen is the
leader of the band, according to
the press bio and her promi-
nence in the photographs of the
band, but she's the songwriter,
too, penning every song single-
handedly. Her songwriting

- skills won't set the world on

    

TWELVE ARMS TO HOLD
YOU

The Flashcats

Bogus Records

The Flashcats, the latest in a,

long line of local bands to
release an album, have some-
thing great to offer: Twelve Arms
To Hold You.

This sextet features a differ-
ent sound than the other popu-
lar Pittsburgh bands; the ’Cats
draw heavily on Motown roots
to create a R&B—based rock
complete with horns. The result
is music that is a fresh change
from blue-collar rock (via The
Houserockers) and power pop (a

I la The Silencers).

There are twelve songs on the

fire, but they're more than com:
petent and often very tongue-
in-cheek; ~ especially those that
include various Catholic school
references in them: "Oh, sister,
can you tell me, where did I go
wrong/ Why make me stand in the back
of the class in this uniform/I neoer

thought about those boys like you said/I

don't wanna go to hell, I don't even
want to be dead..." (”Private
School”). But the lyrics do get a
bit tiresome after awhile since,

for the most part they deal with

boys and love, boys and love,
boys and love. Petersen's voice,
however, should keep you from
getting bored. If you're looking
for comparisons, itcould be des-
cribed as a cross between Patti
Smith and early Marianne
Faithfull, but it's really quite
distinctive all on its own.
There's an endless list of
potential singles on this debut

album, but "Someone New," _

"C'est Impossible," "A Boy For
Me” and ”Private School," seem
safe to bet on (if American radio
were smart, that is).

Despite the. fact that I'm

rather disappointed that I can't

write Catholic Girls off as another
piece of trash, it's good to know
that there's something out
there worth listening to that's
on a‘ major record label.

LYDIA LUNCH'& 13.13
Lydia Lunch & 13.13
Ruby Records

Okay, I'm. all in favor of not
being normal—different music
for different people and all that.
There's room enough in the
”rock” genre for just about
everything, from REO to The
Dead Kennedys, but that
doesn't mean that crap belongs
there, too.

Lydia Lunch is supposed to be
the Exene (lead singer of L.A.'s
X) of the New York music scene,
but I fail to see how. This record
is: boring, stupid, pretentious,
droning, well, you get the idea.
Maybe I'm being too harsh, see-
ing that Lunch is one of New
York's practically—legendary
underground superstars (along

with people like Richard Hell -

and Glenn Branca), but I dislike
this record intensely and dare
anyone to say that it's a listena-
ble product. Maybe it ‘wasn't

I intended to be—you can never

be sure with these serious
avant-garde types—but, then,
what was it supposed to bel say?
I dunno, and I wonder if Lunch
and company do, either. Each
song slides into the other,
undistinguishable but for the
mandatory silent pause. Is this

art? Let's hope not; otherwise,

bring back the Dark Ages.

AMERICAN FOOL .
John Cougar
Riva /Polygram

John Cougar has let it be
known that he's tired of dodg-
ing Bruce Springsteen compari-
sons; enough is enough, cease
firing! Gladly, John; I mean you
two may share fashion
designers and true, neither of
you can find the time to shave

regularly, but, ah, that's about _

it. If I had to liken the vocal style

to anyone, it would be Rod Ste-

wart, minus the Cockney of
course.

John Cougar has spent his
summer vacation playing a

‘ mean game of "king of the hill”
thanks to American Pool and the S

two monster singles it has

spawned. The album's merits

aside, Cougar has managed to
I

___The Flashcats——]ust Boppin The Blues_

  

fill a long standing void in that J9 l

pre-teen America finally has a
true-to-life, home—grown rock
’n’ roll hero of some substance.

American Pool tells one long
story about how we all would
love to prolong adolescence-
indefinitely.

Some of the material on Amer-
ican Fool tells the story better
than othereand unlike Pete
Townshends', John Cougar’s

views on growing old- are‘

straightforward; no cryptic
Dead Sea scrolls here. The hard-
driving ”Thundering Hearts"
sounds like a possible monster
smash No. 3, as does the album's
only cover—”China Girl,” on
which Cougar bares the softer
and more subtle qualities of his
voice.

Unfortunately, radio‘ types
discovered "Jack and Diane" and

have been playing it and playing

it, over and over to the point
where it can now trigger Pavlo-
vian responses. Sad,,because to
virgin ears, it's an incredible
stroke of realism that scrapes

away to the marrow of young ,

hearts and young lives and their
prospects for the '80s. The ”me
and Terry” of Springsteen's
”Backstreets” searched for
affirmation, and the young lov-

ers in Seger's ”Night Moves" _

settled for desperation. Jack and
Diane have seemingly resigned
themselves to an America of
divorce,death and taxes, doing
”the best they can.” In Cougar’s
view, there sen be 9.9 semanti-
cism; no cities screaming or far
off sounds of thunder.

In terms of complexity, Cou-
gar’s last album Nothing Matters
and What If It Did far outshines
American Pool, the-former being
produced by R&B genius Steve
Cropper and possessing the sin-
gle ”Ain't Even Done With The
Night.” For whatever reason,
Cougar seems a bit more angry
on American Pool, and he's been
out and about talking like
another Billy Joel. Whoops,

another comparison. A little"

more nasal and I bet he'd sound
just like Bob Dy—ah, never

' mind!

Cindy Sotak is credited‘ wit ‘
half of the tracks, including
”Appetite For Love" and ’’Watch
Your Step" two of the best cuts
on the album. Other favorites
(favorites, ~ '_cause they're all
good!) are "Don't Cut Me Out,"
”Heartbeat" and "5 to 10."
Carl M. Grefenstette, the
group's drummer and leader,
produced the album for his pri-
vate label, Bogus Records,
which also brought you Made In

If reputations make rock con-
certs good or bad, this double-
bill-would have been great. But,
performances, not reputations,
make concerts, and on those
grounds, Kansas and Cheap

mance featuring the old favor-
ites "Surrender/’ "I Want You
To Want Me," ”Day Tripper,"
”Gonna Raise HeIl," ’-’Ain’t,That
A Shame” and ’’Dream Police.”
New cuts from the One On One
album included the title track,
"She’s Tight” and ”If You Want
My Love.” Nielsen was his usual
self, throwing handful after
ha.ndfU.l'of guitar‘ picks into the
crowd,‘ and Robin Zander strut-
ted around‘ stage while some of
the girls begged himto "Take

Cheap Trick did what they do
best (and very well on ‘this
night), and that is, go out and

After a surprisingly short
intermission, during which they
opened the roof of the Arena,
the house lights dimmed. A
long, taped introduction was
played, and then, there was
Kansas.

A (well together; the group likes to
play here, and the people love to

see them. Saturday night was
no exception. People on the
floor stood for the entire set; it
seemed everyone was very
excited. Maybe they were cur-
ious as to the live talents of new
lead singer John Elefante, but
after a few numbers, the crowd
had slid him into the slot
vacated by Steve Walsh. It was
as if John had been there all
along. -

The set was made up of many
older hits and a good deal of the
new album, Vinyl Confessions.
"Portrait (He Knew," '’Play The
Game,” "Point Of Know
Return” and ”Carry On Way-
ward Son" were the songs the
crowd received best. An acous-

tic set including ”Hold On,”
”Dust In The Wind" and Ele-
fante’s ”Chasing Shadows" was
also much appreciated by the
highly enthusiastic mob.

The band (Kerry Livgren,
Rich Williams, Phil Ehart,
Robby Steinhardt, Dave Hope
and Elefante) was tight and
looked prime, even though they
have been on the road for two
months. The‘seventh man on

stage, Warren Ham, is not a true
Kansas member, but his flute,
sax and backing vocals added
greatly to the performance.‘

With the sets turned in by
these two veteran bands, you
can believe that their reputa-
tions went up a few notches, but
I'm sure they can live up to even
higher expectations next year
when they, undoubtedly, will
return.

not mine (I had C-section tix), I
was actually offered a seat very
' close to the stage. Everyone
around seemed to have such nice
teeth. A familiar-looking gentle-
man stepped up to the mike as the
band took stage. “Welcome to the
Olivia Newton—John Show,” he
spoke. It was Tom Scott, legend-
ary saxophonist and sessionist.
Scott announced thatihe and his
band of top-notch studio musi-
cians, including Robert Popwell
and Carlos Vega, would be pro-
viding the music for Olivia tonight,
but that first the band was going
to play some “solo” numbers.
With this Scott and band played
some excellent instramental ver-
sions of “Tomcat,” and Paul
McCartney’s
Amazed” along with a funky
“Johnny B. Bad,” and other

tunes. The set was very short, but

it got a lot of response from this
peachy-keen audience.

Twenty minutes later, the band
returned to stage and prome-
naded into an orchestral version
of “I Honestly Love You,” while
above, on a gigantic movie screen
the most egotistical film flashed
showing pictures, magazine cov-
ers, and newsclippings that
wowed Olivia’s career from start
to present. My passion turned to
nausea as I watched my Olivia
resort to one of the lowest forms
of commercialism. I felt as ifl had
been thrust into a cold shower.

But then, there she was, on the
risers above the band, dressed in
a black mini-skirt ensemble with
black nylons (the ones with the
seams) and black boots—Olivia!
The man next to me was brayin
like a donkey—l felt feverish. The
band offered “Deeper Than The
Night,” and Olivia wrapped her
voice around it with crystal clar-

~“Maybe I’m ,

ity. She seemed to have full con-
trol of her vocal range and used it
to her advantage. A
Olivia and band_ then ran

through the gamut of her Top 40
career in a sort of chronological
order. There was “Let Me Be
There,” “Have You Ever Been
Mellow,” “If You Love Me, Let Me
Know,” the two songs from
Grease, “A Little More Love,”
“Magic,” and a major helping from
her Physicalalbum. A Her delivery
was ﬂawless, but there was no real
feeling there. There was no sweat,
no strainig——jsut a whole lot of
perfect breathiness. The only
song that even seemed to take

any real effort was a cover of Dolly -

Parton’s “Jolene.”

The band, on the other hand,
was something else. Tom Scott
and friends were tighter than Oli-
via’s spandex pants and a whole
helluva lot more energetic. The
band had no problem achieving

the wide range of musical styles .

that Newton-John’s music
encompasses. From the twang of
her earlier country career to the
galactic Electric Light Orchestra-

tions of her “Xanadu” stint, this -

band didn’t miss anything. In fact,
the best parts of the concert were
when Olivia would disappear for a
costume change and Tom Scott
would take over with some effort-
lessly brilliant saxophone solos.

An hour—and-a-half later, Olivia
and band left the stage as fire-
works boomed over the open
Civic Arena roof. There would be
no encores, only a ﬁlm that listed
of all things, credits to I hair-
dressers, accountants, etc., ad
nauseum. I half expected to see
an applause sign flashing
overhead.

As I left the Arena with all the
other nice people, I could only feel
that I had fallen into the oldest
trick in the book of marketing. My
libido had been preyed upon for
the sake of 17 bucks. For less than
that I could have found the same
thing on Liberty Avenue.

Can the Panther offensive line open holes like this against Florida State, as it did last
year? B

By BRIAN BALK

it geaiar E6Eﬁ‘éfB§E1é rim Lewis

has one goal in mind this weekend

it is to prevent lightning from
striking twice.

Consider the similarities
between this weekend's contest and
the one that occurred in 1980. The

~weather that night was hot and

muggy—the forecast for Saturday
promises to be the same. The
Panthers were undefeated and
positioned at the Nol 1 rank in the
UPI po1l—same situation now.
The Panthers were met that night
by a rowdy, vile group of antago-

nistic fans—the Florida State spirit’

hasn't changed a bit.

But there is one difference in this
weekend's match-up.

In 1980, Lewis watched the
Panthers’ aspirations go up in
smoke i the comfort of his living
room, as he was sidelined with a
broken toe. Thisyear, he is back in
his corner and ready to defend the
Panther right to a national
championship.

I walked into Three Rivers Sta-
dium last Thursday with an eight
dollar parking stub, a bottle of R01-
ling Rock, four drunk friends and a
newspaper that said that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh was the No. 1
team in the nation. I left with the
ticket stub and four drunk friends.
The newspaper has gone, along
with the Rolling Rock, onto the
rug at Three Rivers. I'm glad. I
don't like beer and I especially
detest national championships
before they're won.

In this past week, I've heard
more cliches and excuses used to
describe Pitt's 7-6 victory over
North Carolina than I care to hear.

Lewis said that fans helped out
Florida State in the 1980, defeat of
Pitt. With two 48-inch speakers
strategically placed toward the
Panther bench on Saturday, it
appears ' that the Seminoles are
going to use the same verbal tactics.

Lewis, however, is prepared for
this.

“I’ve been going up and looking
at a lot of film, trying to pick up
tendencies of the players,” Lewis
said. “It’s very important to go into
a game having an idea of what to
expect. You have to. train yourself
for each team.”

Lewis, along with the entire de-
fensive unit, has had Strategl’
mapped out for the Seminoles.

“We're basically going to do the
same thing as we did against North
Carolina,” Lewis said. We re
going to pressure their offense as
much as we can.

Quick reaction time is a necessity
at each position, but it is especially
important in the secondary. As
Lewis explains, “Football is basi-
cally a game of adjustments. Each

you're No. 1 and you listen, they
deserve to tell you why you're not,
even if you still might be.

Peo_ple._across the nation seem to
be asking all the wrong questions,
and people in Pittsburgh seem to
be giving all the wrong answers.
There are no questions to ask and
no answers to give. Who cares
who's No. I in the middle of Sep-
tember? Or for that matter, in the
middle of December? Isn't it who's
No. I at the end of the season that
counts? Ask Clemson!

Pittsburghers seem to be confus-
ing aspirations with realities. Look
folks, Washington's No. l, at least
on the Associated Press poll, but
I'm not about to call them national
champions, yet.

student this year, I asked myself,

play, you have to watch and react
quickly.”

Lewis is one of the few versatile
athletes who have the ability to
view the game from both offense
and defense. He not only starts as a ‘
defensive cornerback, but he also
has the evading agility to run back
kickoffs. '

Ironically, Lewis was recruited
to Pitt as a flanker—a far cry from
deflecting passes and chasing
down tailbacks. However Lewis
was not out for the glory of snag-
ging the winning touchdown.

“I wasn't comfortable on
offense,” he said. “I felt better on
defense.”

Lewis’ talents were first unleased-
at Penn Ridge High School, in Per-
kasie, Pa. There he led the offensive
attack as a running back. He also
led the team’s defense as the team’s
free safety.

The performance he displayed
on both units was so outstanding
that he was ‘given the honor of
playing both offense and defense at

thers. And to be honest, I asked
myself why I sometimes rooted
against them. I couldn't find an
answer, that was until after Thurs-
day’s.game. It seems Pittsburgh
Panther fans love to be the cream of
the crop, the coup de grace, the life
of the party. -

I have a problem with that kind
of thinking. Iprefer hamburgers to
fillet mignon and salt and pepper
to spice. I don't like macho men at
parties and have always enjoyed
the story of the country bumpkin

I've always liked underdogs.

By SCOTT DELLETT

The big question for the Panther
football team this weekend, as they
visit Florida State at Doak Camp-
bell Stadium, is what kind of
offense they will utilize. Will it be
the high-scoring, big yardage
machine that spurred fear into the
hearts of the opposing defense or
will it be the inconsistent, low-
scoring, boring flop that appeared
on national television last.
Thursday?

The question will be answered at
10 p.m. tomorrow night. The Sem-
inole defense isn't exactly one of
the best around, in fact, it resem-
bles a sieve. Florida State gave up
31 points to Cincinnati in their sea-

son opener two weeks ago, and the.

Bearcats are not known as an
explosive ballclub. _
It's Florida State's offense that IS

going to win games. After all, it put...

38 points on the scoreboard against
Cincinnati.

The Seminole attack has the
respect of defensive coordinator
Charlie Bailey. ‘

“Bowden’s a wide open coach,”
Bailey said. “He keeps you off bal-
ance with screen passes. Against
Cincinnati, he threw 15 screen
passes. They do a lot of things top
catch you by surprise.”

“They have good skill people,”
Bailey continued. “If we're not

There were too many fans cheering
a national champion, and not
enough cheering a team which was

found in the locker rooms of the
teams that tried a little harder.

Three of those skilled people are
quarterback Blair Williams and‘
tailbacks Ricky Williams and Greg
Allen. Blair Williams played
against the Panthers last season in
their 42-14 loss, threw 12 out of 19
passes for 158 yards and one touch-
down; Against Cincinnati, the
senior completed 16 of 21 for 164
yards and one touchdown.

Williams and Allen alternate at
the tailback position with positive
results. Williams started against
Cincinnati and ran for 92 yards on
18 carries while catching two
passes for 48 yards, with one going
for a touchdown. Allen, a sopho-
more, had 90 yards on 20 carries
and three touchdowns, while
returning five kickoffs for 141
yards.

aerials are split, ends Jessie Hester
and Dennis McCennin and
flankers Tony Johnson and Has-
san Jones. Johnson caught a 12-
yard touchdown pass in the
opener, while Jones, a freshman,
won Florida Player-of-the-Year
honors in his senior‘ year in high
school. Mowatt is a big. target for-
Williams, and he is able to run
with the ball after he catches it.

In order for any offense to be suc-
cessful, a quality offensive line is

Pitt Now That They’re Underdogs

because the Panthers gradually
became the underdog. Underdogs
aren't losers, they're just folks who
have to try a little harder. They're
the kids from the country who,
because nobody knows them,
aren't considered as good as the
boys from the city. They're the
Green Bay Packers of the 19605 and
the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s.
They're not America's team,
they're Pittburgh’s team. And
when the season's over, they're the
guys who tried a little harder,,who
hung in a little longer and who
have a national championship.

That may be the 1982 Pitt Panth-
ers. But this is the last time you'll
see me write it. And I hope this is
the last time the players care to read

it. That is, until after the season.

The loss of Sandy Pigeon will hurt the Panthers’ chance otan Eastern Swimming

Championship.

By SEAN BARNES

It will be a tough season for the
Pitt Panther swim team. Only a
handful of Panthers remain who
swam on the team that dominated
the East for six consecutive years,
compiling a 51-7 record. But of the
seven who remain, six, including
three sophomores, have competed
in Nationals.

But it will not be individual per-
formances that win dual meets.
Head coach Fred Lewis will have to
train the young Pitt team with all
the expertise he has acquiredfff his
team is to outswim last year's East-
ern Champion, West Virginia.
Lewis has been doing his home-
work however, and has enlisted
recruits with the caliber to possibly
replace four-time National free-
styler Rick Carter, and three time
National swimmer Sandy Pidgeon.

From the New Jersey Wahoos
Swim Club, Lewis recruited fresh-
man Don Martin. Martin repre-
sents a very valuable point scorer in

such events as the 200-yard breast- ’

stroke, the 400-yard individual
medley, and the 1000-yard freestyle.

“He’s a very talented hard
worker,” Lewis said. “He was

matched against Sandy over last
Christmas and actually beat him.”

The hole left by Carter was coin-
pounded when National freestyler
Ed LaNoue was declared ineligible
this season due to academic prob-
lems. Fortunately, senior Jerry
Zaleski is returning. Zaleski is a
National qualifier in two freestyle
events.

junior J. D. McCrillis will aid
the Panthers tremendously in the
next two years, having gained
National qualification along with
Zaleski in two Pittrelays. McCrillis
will be a strong leader as well as a
power in all freestyle events. Senior
Pete "Doyle also returns for his
senior season with Zaleski to aid in
filling in Carter’s vacancy.

Lewis, recognizing the hole long
before it was dug, recruited Bob
Cuthbert from Bethlehem, Pa.
Cuthbert is a state finalist in the
50-yard freestyle and‘also achieved
High School All-America honors
in the 400-yard freestyle. His versa-
tility in both long and short free-
style events will be used by Lewis
this season.

come a long way in two seasons.

 Catlett Opens Mouth And Inserts Foot

If"

By SCOTT DELLETT

The air pollution coming from
the south is not from the steel mills
along the Monongehela River:
rather, it's from the basketball
office at West Virginia University.

Gale Catlett has opened his
mouth again.

Obviously, he wouldn’t be
named the most popular person on
the Pitt campus.

After the Mountaineers 82-77
win last year, Catlett called the
Panthers a ‘‘mediocre’' team, If it
had been the last meeting of the
season, it would not have had such
:1 shocking effect. But he happened
to say this a couple of weeks before
the Fasterii 8 championships. West
Virginia made the finals. So did
Pitt. The rest is history.

Now Catlett is saying that he
wouldn’t play Pitt in basketball if
it were up to him. In an interview
in the Charleston Daily Mail,
Catlett said that Pitt needs West
Virginia in basketball, not the
other way around. Before that
statement can be rebuffed, one
must look at the recent history of
Gale Catlett.

There's no doubt that he has
been successful, considering his
won-loss records at the Universitys
of Cincinnati and West Virginia.
But once his past record is exam-

ined closely, one might consider
Catlett less than honorable. For
example:

0 Catlett left Cincinnati to take
the job at West Virginia. Several
months later, the NCAA put Cin-
cinnati on probation for recruiting
violations. Sort of running out on
his problems.

0 A report last winter said that
several Mountaineer basketball
players were under the minimal 2.0
average demanded by the NCAA in
order to remain eligible to play.
Maybe it’s Catlett’s proposition to
bring the kids in, put them on the
court for four years and forget
about them after their four years
are up. Some programs are success-
ful going this route. but in the final
analysis. they get their just due.

0 Catlett announced the inten-
tion of Renaldo Brown, a 6-5 for-
ward from Michigan, to come to
West Virginia. A NCAA no—iio.
West Virginia received a public
reprimand for this action. Despite
being a minor rule violation, it is a
rule, and Catlett should have real-
ized it. Maybe he did.

Judging from what Catlett has
done in the past. you have to
wonder if he is trying to d1r€Ct
attention away from his team and
the possible connections of
corruption.

Catlett said that if Pitt would
have stayed in the Eastern 8, the

conference would have had a
chance to be the best ever. He added
that because of the plans and per-
sonality of the basketball adminis-
trators, Pitt denied member schools
an opportunity for such a league.

If Catlett had a chance tojoin the
Big East, do you think he’djump at
the chance? West Virginia finished
with a 27-4 record last year, but
they were not ranked as high as
their record would indicate because
they played in the Eastern 8.
Though the league was stronger
than in previous years. its reputa-
tion for fielding weak teams
remains. Fortunately for both Pitt
and West Virginia, the relation-
ship between the heads oi the
athletic departments is very good.
According to Catlett, WVU athletic
director Fred Schaus believes the
rivalry should continue because of
its rich tradition. Associate athletic
director Dean Billick would not
comment on Catlett’s statements,
but he did say the Pitt-West Vir-
ginia basketball game would con-
tinue past 1984, which is the last
year of a two-year home-and-home
contract. Though it’s great to have
a rivalry as intense as Pitt-West Vir-
ginia, wouldn't it be funny if Gale
Catlett were kissing the feet of Roy
Chipman when Pitt becomes a
power in the Big East and refuses to
Dlay West Virginia?

It’s Not Winning That Counts; It’s How Much 

By DALE MOORE

just one week into the 1982 col-

» lege football season and already

there is a new No.1 team and the
former one didn’-t even lose.

Viewpoint  

 

The Associated Press football
poll released Monday lists the
Washington Huskiesas the top
team in‘ the nation replacing the
Panthers‘ The poll, comprised of

\

The ,P:i,u.; N'€w§,.«;f7,Iid§¥‘E5¢P%ﬁm.b.€I111:: L982  .

the opinions of sports writers. is
one of the two most watched polls
in the nation.

_ How could Pitt lose the top spot
in the nation and not lose their
Opening game?

Granted the Panthers didn’t look
devastating in their first outing.
The big-time, high-powered
offense looked about as good as
soggy cornflakes. But let’s not kid
ourselves. The offense will come
around with time.

The outcome of thegame proved
that the Panthers are the best in the
nation. Pitt met a major adversary
in North Carolina, who was

ranked anywhere from No. 2 to No.
6 in the pre-season polls. They
defeated the Tar Heels while hav-
ing one of their poorest offensive
efforts in recent years, thanks to a
stellar defensive show. The game
instilled a very important ingre-
dient in the Pitt Panthers: poise.
This quality is needed to win the
national championship.

What incredible featdid the Uni-
versity of Washington perform to
become the love of the nation’s
sports writers? They beat the Uni-
versity of Texas at El Paso.When
the final gun sounded-probably
to put Texas-El Paso out of its
misery—the final score was 55-0.

Believe it or not the U.T.E.P. Min-
ers are a ranked team. In the
October issue of Penthouse Maga-
zine, a reference source beyond
compare, U.T~.E.P. is distin-
guished by its fourth place ranking
in the bottom 20. The Miners gave
up an average of over 40 points a
game last year and sent their coach
packing.

Given the ability of U.T.E.P.,
the Huskies didn’t do anything out
of the ordinary, in fact the perfor-
mance may have been a poor one.
Over the last five years, during
which it was never ranked at the
top, Brigham Young University

defeated the Miners with an aver-
age of 59 points a game compared
to the Miners’ 8.

The positive side to being ranked
second is that you have someone to
catch. Also remember that it is Sep-
tember and not January who leave
the Pitt camp now may be out in
the cold when the New Year rolls
around.

Panther
Against
Seminole

continued from page seventeen

6-4, 248 pound junior leads the
Seminoles.

Florida State’s defense is a differ-
ent story. In last year’s game, the
Panthers gained 503 yards total
offensive, 252 on the groundand
251 in the air. Bowden sees no
weakness in the offense, despite
their "performance against North
Carolina.’

“Pitt is good in every area of the
football game,” Bowden said.

“Last year we went up to Pitt
expecting them to pass, then their
runner (back Bryan Thomas)
breaks a rushing record.”

Still, despite the high praise
issued by Bowden, the Seminoles
must be able to stop the potent
Panther offense.

“We can’t put eleven men back
there,” Bowden said, “but I hope
we can get away with rushing three
or four lineman.”

The Seminole defense is quick,
and with junior tackle Alfonso
Carreker (6-6, 250 pounds) they
have the size and the speed needed
to put pressure on the defense. jun-
ior linebacker Ken Rose is a hard
hitter, despite being 6-1 and 210
pounds, which issmall for the
position.

One thing head coach Foge
Fazio plans to do tomorrow night
is get some playing time for the
younger members of the squad.

“I was criticized for not playing
backups,” Fazio said. “I plan on
using some younger players

‘against Florida State.”

“I have to get a lot of guys ready.
We don’t want to put any guys in
who aren’t mentally prepared.”

Fazio still remembers the upset
in 1980, which cost the Panthers a
chance at the National Champion-
ship. One of the reasons may have
been the large vocal crowd.

“Florida State had two weeks to
practice for us,” Fazio said.
“They’re going to be a hostile
crowd at the stadium. They will
have 48-inch speakers pointed
toward the bench. I don’t know if it
will be a factor.”

Pitt and Florida State should be
able to minimize their first—game
mistakes.

“A team makes most of its
improvement from the first game
to the second,” Bowden said.
“Against North Carolina, Pitt
stopped themselves with mistakes
that are correctable. We did the
same thing against Cincinnati. If
we can correct our mistakes, we’ll
be a better team too.”

WithiFlorida State’s defense, the

Panthers should prove to be the
better team Saturday night.
PITT N()TIiS—-Pitt will take 70-
72 players to Tallahasse for tomor-
row night’s game. Bryan Thomas,
Rich Kraynak, John Brown and
Dave Puzzoli are almost com-
pletely recovered from injuries suf-
fered in the North Carolina game.
Bill Callahan is still suffering from
bruised ribs and he will be on the
speciality teams. Barry Compton is
hampered by a hamstring pull, but
he will make the trip to Florida.

both his Nautilus weight training
program and in swimming
yardage.

Panther swimming fans will be
hearing a lot from sophomore Ed
Bergan this season. In three back-
stroke events at the 1982 Easterns,
Bergan set new conference records
in all three, which earned him the
Most Outstanding Eastern
Swimmer award. This was no easy
feat, as all three records Bergen
broke were held by former Panther
Stu, Swanson, a ~ three—time All-
America. -

As good as Pitt may be, if any
injuries or unforeseen problems
arise, the situation can get bad
quickly, as Pitt’s lack of overall
depth will be a major factor in their
season’s outcome again this sea-

son. Lewis is aware of this and

knows‘ he must prepare the team
for such problems.

Pitt’s schedule this season
includes eight or nine dual meets,
two Championships——the Big East
at Pitt and Easterns at Syracuse-
and the NCAA Division I Cham-
pionship. With this many chances
to set individual Pitt and Eastern
record times, Lewis says he will try
to break every team record Pitt has,
while swimming his team in as
many events as possible so they will

‘be better prepared both physically
and psychologically for Nationals

in March.

Pitt’s first dual meet is at Kent
State on Nov. 12.

Lewis, Pitt Looking For

33 Game. At that game Lewis
caught two touchdown passes and
picked off two of the opponent’s
spirals. Coincidentally, those two
interceptions had come from Pitt
teammate Dan Marino, who
played on the West squad.

The 6-1, 193 lb. Lewis comes
from a family where football is

‘almost hereditary. His brother Will

played with the Seattle Seahawks
and the Kansas City Chiefs. The
same professional path is indicated
for Tim.

“I’m no bigger than I was fresh-
man year,” Lewis continued.
“Experience is what you need. If
you have the intelligence, you can

cover almost anyone regardless of
size." Lewis said that the only way
to attain such intelligence is with

.plenty of playing time.

“If we're ahead by several touch-
downs I think that the second and
third string players should be put
in. That’s how I got my expe-
rience,” Lewis explained.

Perched on top of a washer dur-
ing its final spin, Lewis smiled and
gave an optimistic forecast.

“It didn’t look like it last Thurs-
day night, but once our offense gets
clicking, there isn’t a defense in the
country that can stop us.”

Lewis once again emphasized
that uproarious crowds have little
impact during a game.

“Out on the field you are think-
ing so much about stopping your
guy, you're not concerned with
what’s happening in the stands.
The only time you hear the crowd

is on the sidelines standing
around.”
Lewis’ ability to block out

audiences and concentrate on the
game will really be tested this
weekend.

Lewis said that the reason he
came to Pitt instead of any other
school was because he wanted to
play for a championship team.

'And if the Panthers can overcome

such obstacles as excessively rowdy

crowds, it looks like Tim Lewis »

will finally get that chance.
