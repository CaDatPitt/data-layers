Campus excluded by Shepard decision

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

The students of the University of Pittsburgh will
have one undergraduate representative on the search
committee to ﬁnd a successor to retiring President
Wesley Posvar. Student Government Board President
Julie Shepard was given the responsibility to appoint
that student and decided to choose a member of the
SGB rather than open the position to all Pitt students.

Shepard’s actions have drawn strong criticism from
minority student leaders, who say that her selection
process has shut out minority Pitt students from
having a say in the selection process.

Doug Ligons, Black Action Society chairperson,
pointed to several reasons he thought may have
motivated Shepard. _

“Basically in the desire to maximize convenience
and in the desire to maximize inﬂuence, they chose
a member of their own. You know it would have
been a big inconvenience for them to go out and try
to get a consensus from all of the groups, even though
that would have been the right way,” Ligons said.

“Obviously if you put someone from your own
group in there then you are directly represented on
the search committee.”

Donald Ainslie, a graduate student member of
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance, agreed that
Shepard’s selection method was irresponsible.

“It is unfortunate that she did not take seriously the
real multiplicity of concerns of the members of this

the power to represent Pitt. undergraduates adequately.

This month the SGB proved-that when given this power,
they make immature and uniformed decisions, which do
not represent the interests of the undergraduate student
body. ‘

university. Often we fail to overcome the separatism that
structures the student groups on campus. It is difficult to do so,
but I think the SGB president has ‘the responsibility to attempt it,”
Ainslie said.

Shepard defended her choice and explained why
she had not opened the position to all students.

“I was given a very short amount of time to find
someone —— like a week,” she said.

Shepard, however, sent out the announcement of
her appointee, sophomore Lisa Campoli, on Sept. 18,
10 days before the faculty announced its
representatives on the committee.

When asked why she hadn’t employed an election
process to pick the representative as the faculty did,
Shepard replied, “Because the faculty are still griping
about who their representatives are going to be. I
wanted to have ours done very organized, and if I
have a good enough person up here, if I have the best
person here, then I don’t see any reason I should
open it up.” Shepard made this statement the day the
faculty released the names of their representatives.

Shepard said that another reason was that the
students who are on the SGB. have proven themselves
already and given themselves credibility.

“I just felt that the pool that I had to work with up
here was among the best that I could pick from.

“lThe student representative] theoretically should
have been the next president of SGB. I-Ioweverl am
not in a position to make that choice right now, and
I went with the best person I thought I could have for
this position,” Shepard said.

There are cu rrently no minority students serving as
board members or Chairpersons at the SGB. Ligons
and Ainslie both said that the SGB is not a representative

The Pittsburgh Shop, an outside vending
operation selling apparel with popular
college logos, has had its license revoked.

The action officially came on Sept. 28
following a letter sent to Charles Bonasorte,
owner of the shop, by the Pittsburgh
department of public safety.

“My license was officially revoked at 4
p.m. [On Sept. 28],” said Bonasorte. “[The
city] came at 4:00 so that I could not get a
court injunction. They allowed me to do
business all day [on the 28th], which
meant that I would be dead all weekend.”

The letter stated that Bonasorte was
subject to revocation in accordance with
Title 7, Section 701.4(a)(3), (5) and (7) of
the Pittsburgh Business Licensing act.

Section 701.4 — License Revocation or

pursuant to the provisions of this Title
may be revoked or suspended by the
License Officer for any of the following (7)
reasons.”

The three sections that Bonasorte are
being held to state that there can be no
violation of rules or regulations of the act,
that a business or vehicle may not be
conducted in an unlawful or unsafe
manner, and that there can be no violation
of city building or zoning laws.

The rules of the act state that in order for
a vending license to be revoked, the
vendor must have first been fined, then
face suspension of the license, first for 50
days and then 90 days. Only after these
three occurrences may the license be
revoked.

According to Bonasorte, The Pittsburgh
Shop, which sells mostly clothing sporting

-the Pitt logo, has yet to have a violation in

2 Live Crew appearance spar/es debate over ‘dirty’ Z)/7"iCS

By Lisa Pugliese
Staﬂ" Writer

The directors of two outspoken
Pittsburgh organizations recently
went head to head to address the
allegedly obscene lyrics of the
popular rap group 2 Live Crew.

Dorn Checkley, executive
director of the Pittsburgh Coalition
against Pornography, and Marion
Damick, associate director of the

V American Civil Liberties Union,

spoke at a press conference
Thursday in what Checkley’s
organization called an emphatic

response to the concert
appearance of 2 Live Crew that
had been scheduled for Sept. 27
in Pittsburgh.

“The messages of the popular
music group 2 Live Crew are a
challenge to everyone who
believes that constructive speech
can triumph over destructive
speech," said Checkley. “People
of good will may differ over
tactics, but in the face of the
Crew’s violent and misogynous
lyrics, everyone is called to
repudiate these messages and
affirm our society's commitment

of respect toward all individuals, ”
he added.

The press conference, held
outside of the Illusions nightclub
in Pittsburgh, came after a ruling
in Ft Lauderdale, Fla., where a
federal judge ruled that the 2 Live
Crew album As Nasty As They
Wanna Be, which has sold 1.7
million copies, was legally
obscene.

In his June 6 decision, Federal
Judgejose A. Gonzalez of Florida
stated that the First Amendment
is one of this country’s most sacred
liberties but underlined that in

legal terms, “obscene speech has
no protection under the First
Amendment.”

Even though the album has a
label stating “Warning: Explicit
Lyrics Contained, " Gonzalez said,
“To be redundant, obscenity is
not a protected form of speech
under the U.S. Constitution, with
or without voluntary labeling. It
is a crime.”

Checkley went on to state that
First Amendment freedoms of
expression were founded on the
hope that constructive speech
would triumph over destructive

speech and viewed the scheduled
Pittsburgh appearance of 2 Live
Crew as putting that principle to
a severe test.

“If we are to live together as a
society where hopes and
aspirations are affirmed and
where dignity and respect are
hallowed, then we must
vigorously respond to these siren
calls of hatred, violence,
disrespect and hedonism,” said
Checkley.

Author Walker inﬂuences Chatham prof

By Tammy Poole
Staﬁ" Writer

Emma Lucas, associate vice
president for academic affairs at

Chatham College, visited the

University of Pittsburgh Thursday
night to discuss her viewpoints
on the author of The ColorPm;0le
Alice Walker.

Lucas, who attended T ougaloo
College in Mississippi at the same
time that Walker was teaching
there, said she especially likes
the way that the author withholds
the developments of a character
while havingga reader eagerly
await for an outcome.

“Sometimes, especially in The
Color Purple, Walker leaves a
character hanging for a while,
almost suspended in mid—air, and
you have to just bear with her
until she brings you to the point
of the character’s development.
And, almost always, there is a
triumphant outcome,” Lucas said.

A one-hour film entitled
"Visions of the Spirit.- A Portrait of

Alice Walker”, sponsored by the
Campus Women’s Organization,
was viewed in room IP56 of
Forbes Quad before Lucas
addressed approximately 30
students in attendance.

“One of the most important
elements of Walker’s writings is
the fact that she talks about the
beings of women," said Lucas.

“What Walker does in essence
is try to bring us from a cycle
where we see the characters as
being oppressed and suppressed
to an evolution of sort, where
they_ come in recognitionof their
own being,” she said.

In order to make students aware
of the way that black women
write about themselves, Lucas
said she combines literary works
into her African American
Woman's course at Chatham
College.

“Even though the course is not
a literature course, I feel that
literature can help individuals
better understand what has
happened in women's lives. That

is why I integrate literature into
some of my sociology and history
courses,” said Lucas.

When asked how Walker has
inﬂuenced her, Lucas said she
was amazed at Walker’s ability to
capture the essence of the struggle
and revolution of women.

“I can’t say that I have really
applied Walker’s writings to my
own personal life, butl deﬁnitely
feel a certain closeness to some
of her novels because we share
the similarity of both having been
from a Southern background and
trying to capture the nature of
black culture,” she said.

Lucas hopes that “students will
recognize how women, such as
Alice Walker, have given valuable
works in literature and have a
richness that can be shared with
everyone.”

Larissa Raphael, a senior
majoring in liberal arts, said she
came to the film and lecture
because she has always been
interested in Walker’s works.

“I wanted to learn more about

her and her work as well as listen
to what others had to say. I also
wanted to get a chance to
understand whatshe was thinking
behind what she was writing
without her having to be a
character in a book,” Larissa said.

“I felt like writing a poem while
watching the film,” she said.

Angela Dick, an exchange
student from England majoring
in American studies, said because
she didn’t know much aboutAlice
Walker, she was very interested
in seeing the film and hearing the
speaker. ‘

“T here’s not too much black
literature going around in England
so I am reading up on American
black literature here,” said Angela.

“I’m really glad that I came to
see the film. It wasn't anything
that I had expected it to be; it was
better. I ﬁnally got a chance to
know Alice Walker,” she said.

SGB has proof that
shuttle" is eﬂeciive

By Randy Legersky
Stag‘ Writer

The Student Government Board has gathered evidence in
favor of implementing the South Oakland shuttle on a permanent
basis.

“This week I received a third letter on the South Oakland
shuttle. Although I won’t name the author, it’s afull—page letter
thanking us very much for it, asking that the South Oakland
shuttle do be placed on a permanent basis kind of scheduling.
And this student gave an individual account of something that
had happened to him before wehad the shuttle, where he was
assaulted on the way home from class  and says that the
incident lefthim with a minor but permanent hearing loss,” said
SGB President Julie Shepard at last week’s SGB meeting.

“These letters become more and more convincing that that
service needs to stay permanent and not just on a trial basis,”
she said.

SGB members Mike Golden andjay Gervasoni told the board
of the result of their meeting with Mary Bonach, director of
book centers.

“The topics we discussed were the book buy-back policy and
the resale of those books, and the long lines we students are
forced to wait in at the beginning of each semester. Some issues
did get resolved out of the meeting. The first one is a new
scanner system  supposedly this system is really good and it
eliminates the wait, and the lines will move a lot faster next
semester,” Golden said.

“I got a lot of letters, and I got a petition signed, and I got
many phone calls this week after The Pitt News article about
the bookstore lines and about the books. Since there is a
substantial mark—up in the price of used books and we were

told that there is nothing that the book store can do about it ,

since that’s how they pay their operating costs, Jay and I are
looking to set up a book swap next semester. This is something
that has been done before on this campus, and what it would

Vices of vegetarianism exposed

By Rebecca Wilkins
For Tbe Pitt News

Animal rights and cruelty to
animals are not appropriate
reasons to be a vegetarian,
according to one Pitt philosophy
teaching assistant.

In a lecture entitled “Why I Am
Not a Vegetarian,” Alec Walen
addressed various arguments
commonly used as reasons for
vegetarianism and explained why
he did not find them convincing.
Walen’s speech was sponsored

by the Philosophy Club last

Wednesday.

"The five challenges to the meat
industry Walen discussed were:
“1) ignores the fact that animals
have a right to life such that we
ought not to kill them; 2) is
incredibly cruel to animals; 3)
wastes a lot of grain that could
feed the hungry; 4), manifests,
cultivates, and exploits a lack of
compassion; and 5) is ecologically
unsound.”

Walen believes that although
animals do have a certain right to
life, it is not the same right that
humans have.

“That is not to say that they
have no right to life; that is just to
say that their right to life can’t be
just like our right to life,” Walen
said.

He said that the difference in
the way animals and humans

“right” to eat meat. “One of the
differences between animals and
humans is that animals don’t have
long, protracted interests‘ in the
future [or] a sense of themselves
living in the future. Humans, by
contrast, do live largely in the
future. There’s some sense that
when a person dies can matter,
as opposed to when an animal
dies,” he said.

In response to the common
idea that American fast-food
chains buy beef from Brazilian
farmers who exploit the rain
forests, Walen said, “My research
says that’s just a bad rumor.”
However, he also admitted that ‘‘I
could be wrong” regarding this
issue. /

It takes 16 pounds ofgrain and
soybeans to produce one pound
of edible beef ﬂesh, and five

pounds to produce one pound of
chicken ﬂesh. Walen said, “In a
world where there are people
starving, you might think, ‘How
insensitive to eat meatlwhen you
could eat grain and save the excess
grain for the starving.”’

Walen believes that although
using excess grain to feed the
starving may be applicable for
the future, it is not possible now.
He cited Ethiopia as an example,
in which the government
prevented the hungry from getting
grain sent by foreign countries.

Walen said that humans are
“natural carnivores,” due to the
craving for meat that many people
experience.

Dave Cooper, former president
and business manager of Friends
of Animals, asked, “Are we also

Current fraternity issues
examined by Greek 101

By Karen D. Speece
Sta_[7'W1‘iter ’

Current issues facing Greeks
are the focus of “Greek 10],” a
program aimed at educating new
members of Pitt’s Greek system.

“If you choose to participate in

this [program], you will be the

first class of graduates from Greek
101. Unfortunately there’s no
credit for it, but maybe in a couple

_ of years, we can do that.” Bridget

Guernsey, Greek advisor, said
Thursday at the class’ first meeting.

The $10 fee for this class will be
used to cover the costs of spea kers
who will be brought here to help
educate members on a variety of
topics.

“We don’t want you to sit and
listen [to these speakers]; we want
you to be able to ask questions.
We want you to voice your
opinion. You may be new
members to the Greek system,
but we want you to be an active
part of this," Guernsey said.

“The Death of the Greek
System," a program on hazing,
will be presented by Gary H.
Bonas, associate director of
student activities at Villanova
University and national officer of
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. This
program will be the next event in

Greek 10] and will be heldon
Oct. 11 at 8:30 pm in the WPU
Ballroom.

“The Toney Lineberry Story,” a

presentation on driving safety, 4

will be presented on Nov. 8 at
8:30 p.m. in the David Lawrence
Auditorium. This program will be
co-sponsored by the Student
Health Advisory Board and the

Department.

On Nov. 29, Greek 10] students
will participate in a dating-
violence workshop, presented by
the Women’s Center and Shelter
of Greater” Pittsburgh. This
program will take place in the
David Lawrence Auditorium at
8:50 pm.

Other programs scheduled for
this term include a leadership
seminar and a presentation on
motivation.

A new “mystagogue" system
will begin this term. This system
allows new fraternity members to
have a “big sister” and new sorority
members to have a “big brother."

City begins pedestrian safety-awareness Campaign

By Marietta Pacella
Staﬂ Writer

The Allegheny County department of
health and the Pennsylvania department
of transportation will kick off a pedestrian
safety awareness campaign targeted at
pedestrians, motorists, bus riders and
bicyclists in the city.

The month-long campaign will begin
with a press conference today at noon on
the steps of the City-County Building on
Grant Street. Authorities from the county,
Port Authority Transit and the Penn DOT
will be attending the conference.

According to Alex Czajkowski, a
representative of the ca mpaign’s
advertising agency, the campaign is geared
toward alerting both pedestrians and
motorists to the dangers of being a
pedestrian. He stated that the process of
teaching people to be more careful —— to
“Look Out” — can’t even begin without
first building that awareness.

The campaign motto is: “There is no
such thing as an accident. Look out.”

“Pedestrian accidents will be avoided if

people simply take the time to think and
pay attention. Our ‘Look Out’ should
remind people, both motorists and
pedestrians, to be on the look out for each
other,” said Rozanne Wilson, director of
the campaign from the Allegheny County
Health Department.

The campaign targets five specific
groups: pedestrians, especially intoxicated»
ones, and jaywalkers; motorists,
particularly those who turn right—on-red;
bus riders, bicyclists and senior citizens.

According to Wilson, senior citizens
account for the largest number of
pedestrian fatalities. Statistics for the area
show that, although one’s risk of being hit
decreases with age, the severity (hf th
injury increases. a

“lThisl is not surprising if you think
about it. As you get older, you're smarter
about traffic, but less likely to bounce
right back if you do get hit,” said Wilson.

The campaign will feature testimonials
from people who were victims and/or
perpetrators of pedestrian accidents. These
testimonials will be heard as public-service
announcements on the radio and will be

seen in brochures which will be distributed
throughout the city at retailers, parking
lots, libraries and other high traffic

locations. They will also be seen on interior

A

  LOOK OUT!

 

bus cards with the space donated by PAT.

PAT will also provide space on the sides
and rear of its buses for campaign safety
messages.

At today’s conference, there will be
several speakers on the issue of pedestrian
safety, who will initiate a smalg
demonstration which will move down
Fifth Avenue to the intersection of Fifth
and Liberty Avenues.

Mayor Sophie Masloff will be one of the
many speakers, according to Joe Small,
another representative of the campaign’s
advertising agency.

Prior to the demonstration, a PAT bus ,
draped with a variety of safety messages
will be unveiled along with the campaign
brochures.

“The numbers themselves are
frightening. About as many people die in
pedestrian accidents in Pittsburgh as from
homicide. But the truly scary part is the
fact that, for the most part, all of those
pedestrian fatalities were avoidable,” said‘
Czajkowski.

“The city wants me out of here,”
said Bonasorte. “Where is the
due process?”

In a Sept. 17 letter written to
Glenn Cannon, public safety
director, from Louis T ronzo,
assistant to the president and
director of Federal and Local
Relations at Pitt, Tronzo states “I
am writing to call your attention
to concerns that we have with

regard to several potentially
dangerous public- safety
situations on the streets that run
through and adjoin our Oakland
campus.

E “The first and perhaps the most
serious of these has to do with
the street vendor and the
positioning of his vans on Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard.”

The letter goes on to state that
Bonasorte’s two vans, which he
parks at Forbes and Bigelow are

causing a dangerous situation
because of loading and unloading
operations.

T ronzo states that the operation,
especially during peak traffic
hours “obstructs the view of
drivers who are in the Forbes
Avenue eastbound left lane
preparing to turn left onto Bigelow
Boulevard, and into the flow of
pedestrian traffic crossing
Bigelow on the north side of
Forbes.”

“The issue is not the safety of

There had been speculation of

Bonasorte and the campus store

body for all students and therefore
was not the proper place for
Shepard to find the appointee.

“Student Government Board is
not an entirely representative

I student organization; I don’t think

they represent much other than
the people who make up the
majority of the student campus. I
think that there are many other
qualiﬁed candidates who are
members "of the student body
particularly minority students who
could have ﬁlled [the position] in
my opinion,” Ligons said.

“It would be nice if the SGB
were truly something that
represents the best of the students
on campus. I am sure that the
people that are there are doing
the best they can, but you have to
recognize that’s the way this
campus is structured,” Ainslie said.

“Certain people are
systematically discouraged from
taking part in certain sorts of
activities” Ainslie said. “And it
seems that the SGB is one that
attracts a certain kind of student.
There should be a certain self-
consciousness about that within
the SGB and work by them to
overcome that limitation.”

Shepard said that the lim.ited
pool of people in the SGB was
irrelevant.

“I was looking for the best
person,” she said.

Ainslie said that Shepard should
have at least called all of the
major student leaders together to
discuss possible representatives.

“lThey] could have discussed
what they thought would be
important for a new president of
the university, what the concerns
of various different people and

attitudes on campus were and
perhaps meet with them as a
group and discuss possible
candidates. This board could have
voted on who would be the best
student representative,” Ainslie
said. .

Campoli, who is majoring in
politics, philosophy and
economics, is the chairperson of
the SGB’s governmental—relations
committee. Shepard said that was
one of the reasons she appointed
Campoli.

“With her role mostly on
governmental relations, I mean
she knows the state budgeting
process, which really helps, but
she is also someone who I see as
being very, very bright, and
anything that she doesn’t know,
she can pick up,” she said.

“I also look at it that she is not
afraid to speak her mind
whenever she needs to, which is
important." A

Campoli declined to comment
on what student concerns she
will bring to the committee, citing
the confidential nature of the
search process.

“Being a sophomore [Campoli
has] one year under her belt, but
I don’t see that as being to her
disadvantage, simply because I
think if this process takes longer
than anyone is expecting it to,
much the same as Carnegie
Mellon University’s did, then we
are going to have to have
someone who is going to be
around to do this,” Shepard said.

Campoli said that she will serve
on the committee until a new
president is found.

“I am aware that Harvard's
search took over a year and a
half, I am aware that CMU’s search

takes two years, and that is fine,"
she said.

Campoli also serves as the vice
president of the Student Honors
Advisory Cabinet and serves on
the University Senate
Commonwealth-relations
Committee. Campoli said her
experience will help her on the
search committee.

“I've dealt with being in that
kind of situation with a large
group of people who aren't
around students a great deal,
who don’t expect much from
students,” she said.

Campoli cited her experience
on the Senate Council and with
the American Experience
program as examples of this
situation. “Try going into a room
with 40 other business executives
who think you are a snotty college
kid every week; It's not the most
pleasant experience —- right?

Hopefully [the — Search
Commitee] will be willing to
accept the student opinion when
it has to be voiced, and I hope it
will, no matter what I have to
do,” she said.

Campoli added that her
willingness to listen will make
her an effective member of the
search committee.

Campoli said that she was
disappointed that only one
undergraduate was going to serve
on the committee, a concern that
others echoed.

“I was not in favor of using one
student at all. There is no one
student at the university that
represents every student group,”
Ligons said.

Ligons said that the situation
and Shepard’s behavior in the
matter did not surprise him.

rm: prrr NEWS, Monday, October 1, 1990

“To be left out on the selection
of one that student in particular,
as representing as large a
community as our organization
does, I think that is a large
oversight on somebody’s part. I
guess I shouldn’t say it surprises
me because it is done quite often,
and we are left out quite often in

 

J‘.

the decision making process,” he
said.

“Now my group is going to
have to go through who knows
what to make sure that they are
adequately but not
proportionately to a degree
represented,” he said.

-Fmternity’s Run to Pitt raises moi/teyfor autism institutes

By Jim Wechsler
smﬂ’ Writer ’

Alpha Phi Omega’s Run to Pitt
kicked off the pre-game festivities
for this year’s Pitt/West Virginia
game,
overcoming both the
programming and natural
difficulties that arose.

The 80-mile run began on
Mountaineer Field’s 50-yard line,
where WVU head coach Don
Nehlan traditionally hands off the
game ball to the first runner.

Q;>However, a communication error

forced Laura Guseman,
chairperson of the Run to Pitt, to
pick up the ball in Nehlan’s office
and escort the ball to the SO
herself.

The runners left‘ Mountaineer
Field and traveled up Route 19 as
far as the Liberty Tunnels on
Friday, then they were driven

 into Pittsburgh for safety reasons.

 throughout the run,

Along the way the road proved
treacherous.

“We pulled one [car] alongside
ofthe road to let offsome runners
and kind of got stuck in the
mud,” said Kimberly Mayberry, a
sophomore from Pitt.

A police escort, expected to
accompany the members
actually
began outside of Washington,
Pa. The runners spent the night
in Thistle Hall, Carnegie Mellon
University’s gym.

Said Mayberry, “We wanted to

  

spend the night at Pitt [at Trees
Hall or the Fitzgerald Field
House], but [Pitt representativetl
said it was against policy.”

On Saturday morning at 10:30,
12 runners continued from Forbes
Avenue and Grant Street and
wou nd their way into Pitt Stadium

to the 50-yard line, where they
handed the ball to Pitt head
football coach Paul Hackett.
Each participant ran an
approximately quarter-mile
stretch before being relieved by
another runner. About 40
members from three chapters of

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News
These runners helped carry Saturday's game ball from WVU to Pitt.

Alpha Phi Omega took part in the
run. Along with WVU’s Lambda
Omicron chapter, some members
of Pitt's Beta chapter and CMU’s
Kappa Chapter also ran.

The event, held to raise money
for the treatment and cure of
autism, has been an Alpha Phi
Omega tradition for the last 19
years. The amount of money
raised this year was not
immediately known, but
Guseman said she expects
between $1,000 and $1,500, the
average amount raised in the
past. Half of the funds will be
donated to the West Virginia
Autism Society and the other half
will be donated to the Western
Pennsylvania Autism Society.

The 1990 run had an extra
purpose. Alpha Phi Omega is
pushing to get the Beta chapter
reactivated, and the publicity
generated by the run might draw
new members to the national
coed fraternity. Pitt’s Beta chapter
was deactivated in 1986.

William Swarm, a senior from

the Kappa chapter, said that they
are sponsoring the reinstatement.
“Beta activated us back in 1929,
and We’re returning the favor by
reactivating them,” he said,
punctuating the point with a “high
five” to Mayberry.

With Beta inactive the Lambda
Omicron chapter has been
handling the Run to Pitt (and Run
to WVU, on alternating years) by
itself. Three weeks ago, they
contacted the Kappa chapter, 9‘
which in turn contacted the Beta
representatives. Lambda Omicron
did not know who to contact at
Pitt. Lisa Ballehr, vice president
of service from the Beta chapter,
said, “[Kappal mentioned this run
to us about a week ago, and we
decided to participate.”

Alpha Phi Omega extended its
thanks to Bruceton Bank in
Morgantown, W. Va., for its
support, as well as to the police
escort and the unidentified man
along Route 19 who stopped
mowing his lawn to give the
runners water to drink.

Editorial
Continued from page 1
Frank Lucchino and State Senator
D. Michael Fisher, has been
established to conduct the search
for candidates.

For faculty selections to the
committee, University Senate
President Barbara Shore
conducted widespread elections
to find the people who would
best represent their collective
concerns.

Pitt's undergraduate students
have only one voice on this
important committee, in spite of
the direct inﬂuence its decisions
will have upon our lives. Our
student representative to serve
on the search committee is Lisa
Campoli.

Pitt students did not choose
her as their candidate to serve
their interests on the committee.
Rather, she was chosen by one
Pitt student, Student Government
Board President Julie Shepard.

Shepard, evidently, felt
confident that Campoli will serve
her own interests and the interests
of the SGB effectively. She must
have felt this way, because
Shepard did not consider a single
candidate outside the SGB for the
position.

Shepard did not
applications or hold elections for
the position. She did not interview
possible candidates to weed out
unqualified people. She did not
even let the students who elected
her know that the position was
available. This despite the fact
that every undergraduate student
was entitled to be considered for
this appointment. Instead, she
seems to have taken a look around
the SGB office and based her
decision on convenience and
elitism rather than fairness.

Shepard said that her time in
which to find a representative
was limited, claiming to have had
a week in which to make her
decision. Yet she made her
appointment on Sept. 18, a full
ten days before faculty selections
to the board were announced.

“I wanted to have [our selection]

accept .

done very organized," she said.
This “very organized” procedure
did not, however, include
advertising the position, so that
non—SGB students could apply.

Shepard said that she did not
have sufficient time to advertise
for the position. Yet during the
week of Sept. 11-18, no less than
10 SGB ads ran in The Pitt News.

“I just felt that the pool that I
had to work with up here [at SGB]
was among the best that could
pick from,” she said. “If I have a
good enough person up here, if
I have the best person here, then
I don’t see any reason I should
open it up.”

But there are some very obvious
reasons why the selection process
should have been opened up.
Among them is the fact that there
is not a single minority student
on the Student Government
Board, nor are there any minority
students serving as Chairpersons
on any of the five SGB
committees.

Shepard’s nomination of “the
best candidate” excluded all
minority student groups,
including the Black Action Society
and the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance. She made her selection
from a group of white, middle-
class heterosexual students who
cannot possibly reflect the views
of all students.

She also failed to inform other
student groups or leaders of this
decision. In June, The Pitt News
sent a letter to Shepard, requesting
additional information regarding
the position. On June 25, she
replied, “I have not been informed
of yet as to how student
representatives will be solicited
to sit on this committee. When I
am afforded with more
information in this area, lwill be
sure to contact you."

No effort was made by Shepard
to notify The Pitt News of her
appointment to select the student
representative to the committee
or of the amount of time and the
manner in which she planned to
make the selection.

This is not the first time that
Shepard has acted hastily in
appointing a student to an
important position. Last summer,
when the position of Telefact
student coordinator was open,
Shepard again failed to look
outside the SGB office.

Instead she chose Pam
Gennaula, a Student Government
Board member. SGB member
Patrick Abramowich said that
Gennaula’s appointment was a

matter of “expediency,” (as was »

the case with Campoli) and that
“Pam happened to live in
Pittsburgh  and hadn't had a
student job.”

Abramowich said that he and
Shepard, along with others
involved in Telefact, “sat down
and brainstormed” to think of
possible candidates» for the job.
Three people were then contacted
for the position, and “it just worked
out best for Pam  It was really a
case of the right person being at
the right place at the right time."

The fact that the qualifications
for the highest paying student job
on campus, Telefact student
coordinator, consisted of being
“in the right place at the right
time” is yet another example of
SG B ineptitude in selecting people
to fill positions of importance and
responsibility.

The appointment of the student
on the presidential-search
committee is without question
the biggest responsibility an SGB
president has had in the past 25
years. With careful scrutiny by
the committee, students and
faculty may get a new president
committed to the quality of
education of undergraduate
students, who listens to students
concerns and looks beyond the
dollar figures when administering
power.

As students we have but one
official say in the scheme of things,
and by neglecting all of the other
students outside of the SGB in her
decisions, Julie Shepard has
shown the students who really
counts now that she is in office.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1990

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

All West Virginia did was make
a mockery of Pitt’s defensive
line, have a junior tailback rush
for almost 200 yards and have
one of the speediest receivers in
the nation catch rocket air strikes
from an impressive quarterback
to defeat Pitt, 38-24, in front of
54,689 people on Saturday.

The Mountaineers posted up
547 yards of total offense (378 of
those on the ground) and
controlled the ball for almost 41
minutes. Pretty impressive
numbers in any football game
and impressive enough to justify
a win.

But Pitt coach Paul Hackett
viewed the results as just another

If you looked out on Fifth

Upon closer inspection,
however, you would have
discovered it was only Marcos

This year’s race began at 9 in

Fifth Avenue to Forbes Avenue

Steelers' big question:
Where's the offense?

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Up here at the sports desk in
T/9ePittNew5editorial offices, we
have a huge desk calendar, and
on it we mark every home Steeler
game which we are supposed to
Coven

Since there is only so much
room in each block designating
the day of the month, we have to
abbreviate most of the opponents’
names. Forexample, to designate
next week's home game against
the Chargers, we have “Steelers-
—— S.D.” marked on our calendar.

For yesterday's game, we had
“Steelers—MIA” marked down.
And it now seems like a good
display of foreshadowing as the
Pittsburgh offense was literally
“Missing In Action” against Miami
- for the fourth straight game.

The Dolphins had little trouble
on either side of the ball in their
28-6 victory before 54,691 atThree
Rivers Stadium.

The Steeler offense still has
done nothing. Absolutely nothing.

The unit has still failed to score
its first touchdown of the season,
and runs three plays and punts so
often, that it seems like the Steeler
defense is always on the field.
And they were.

Miami dominated possession
in the first half, with Marino and

his troops keeping the ball for
over 23 minutes. The Dolphins
found the end zone on their first
three possessions, with two 73-
yard and one 80-yard drive
resulting in 21 points. Sammie
Smith scored twice on one- and
seven-yard runs, while Marino
hit Mark Clayton with a 35-yard
strike late in the second quarter.

The Steelers managed only a
field goal during the half, and
they didn't manage much else.

The offense had only one first
down, 27 net yards (14 rushing,
13 passing), and did not convert
once on third down. Bubby Brister
and company were met with a
resounding chorus of “boos”
every time they walked off the
field on fourth down.

“One day you’re a hero, and
the next day you’re a goat in this
business,” Brister said. “lThe fans]
are all down on us now and
rightfully so. We’re not doing
anything on offense, and if I were
in the stands, I’d boo too. They’ve
got something to boo about, that’s
for damn sure.”

Some reasons to boo: Brister
went 7-18 for 76 yards with three
interceptions and no touchdowns,
again.

The Dolphins had enough
confidence on offense to attempt

three fourth-down conversions

Pitt crew ﬁnishes fourth at Head of the Ohio  

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

While football fans were gathering at
Pitt Stadium to witness the annual backyard

. brawl between Pitt and West Virginia, the

Panther Rowing Club was Competing in
the fourth annual Head of the Ohio Regatta.
In this Contest, however, Pitt Came away
faring better against the Mountaineers
thanthe football team did.

Pitt entered a total of 11. boats in the
Regatta, and it took home a total of four
medals, two of which were team medals
and placed fourth overall.

The Head of the Ohio, a Charity fund-
raiser for the Burn Center at Mercy Hospital
of Pittsburgh, has grown in its five-year
span. ThisIyear’s race brought out a total
of 45 teams, 30 of which were collegiate
teams. Some traveled from as far as Florida
and Michigan. ’

The highlight of the day for Pitt Crew
was when it Crushed the West Virginia
Mountaineers in the Open Eights event.
' “It was great,” said Pete Alpern, Pitt
crew’s treasurer. “Yesterday we Crushed
West Virginia.

“We started out 10 seconds after them,”
Continued Alpern, “and we beat them by
about 40 seconds.

“It was our first time in an eight—man
shell,” he said.

Rowing in the eight-man shell were:
(from stroke) Todd Ridenour, John Evers,
Matt Prechtel, Alpern, Lou Moorhead, Pete
Otterbein, Paul Herron, Mike Angello and
Coxswain. Leanna Hopkins.

Pitt women’s crew has become stronger
over the past two years. The two women’s

lightweight boats took the bronze medal
and fourth place, ﬁnishing behind the
first-place Cornell boat and the second-
place Notre Dame boat.

Rowing in the third-place women’s
lightweight boat were (from stroke) Trish
Cloonan, Lori Shofran, Gina Camillo,
Luanne Rosa and Coxswain Leslie Burchett.

Rowing in the fourth-place women’s
lightweight boat were (from stroke) Nancy
Jordon, Ann DiPaolo, Julie Norse, Amy
Meier and Coxswain Jana Damdrogio.

“I think we did ex-Ceptionally well,”
said Cloonan, the club’s vice president.
“We wanted to [place] in the second race,
but we were too tired.”

The men’s heavyweight boat also took
a bronze medal finishing behind last year’s
winner, the Milwaukee Rowing Club, and

After last spring’s Competition at the

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, October 1, 1990

Pitt defense needs something, omyt/ymgg

It seems unanimous.

Something must be done about
the Pitt’s football team’s defensive
generosity.

The West Virginia University
Mountaineers ran wild on the
Panthers’ defense Saturday. WVU
gained a total of 547 yards (378
rushing and 161 passing) when
their offensive troops graced the
field.

To put it mildly, it was ugly.
The Mountaineers averaged 5.72
yards per attempt, with their
backup tailback Michael Beasley
gaining 197 yards on 22 carries.

So where does the blame fall?
Pitt defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen believes that it goes
back to football basics. “We had
people in position to make plays,
and they didn't do it. We just
didn’t tackle, which is a basic
fundamental in football,”
vonAppen said.

“If we hope to achieve the
same winning percentage as last
year’s team, we have to address
the same weakness that plagued
them, and that is stopping the
run,” vonAppen noted.

The Mountaineers’ offense was
on the field for 40 minutes and 53
seconds, and when a team has
that long to figure the other team
out, bad things are bound to
happen.

PantherseniorlinebackerCraig
Gob was searching for things the
Pitt defense could have done

differently, in hopes of shutting
the Mountaineers down.

“It seemed to me that everyone
in the defensive huddle thought
they were in the right places to
make the tackles,” said Gob. “I
guess we are going to have to
take a look at the game films and
see what we can do about
stopping teams.”

A dejected Keith Hamilton
couldn’t quite figure out why the
Panthers couldn’t stop WVU. “I

Doug
Miller

have all the confidence in the
world in my coaches and with
my teammates —- I just have to
look at the game films to see
what we did wrong."

I for one would hate to be at
the film session, particularly the
when the defense is the featured
“star.” There will be no popcorn
and no Cokes, just a boisterous
vonAppen replaying and pointing
out mistakes to his troops.

VonAppen said, “We are going
to do considerable assessing and
re—evaluation after looking at the
films  We don’t have the same
latitudes that professional teams
have, in that we can’t waive
players and trade for ones that
can do the jobs that we need

done?

So as it stands now, vonAppen
will have to start searching for
players to fill in holes that have
been caused by injuries. Those
currently on the shelf include
starting linebacker Curtis Bray,
who after blitzing WVU
quarterback Greg Jones sustained
a dislocated elbow.

How about these players for an
all~MASH team: linebackers
Nelson Walker, Mark Shemanski,
Shawn Abinet, Michael Boykin,
Keith Little and Terrance
Wheatley.

Let’s move now to the
secondary; those nursing injuries
in this group include Lex Perkins
and Steve Israel, while on the
line Todd Pipkin, Jon Baker and
Sean Gilbert are all feeling the
effects of a strenuous schedule.

The Panthers have next
Saturday off to lick their wounds
and regroup. After that, it’s the
Scarlet Knights from Rutgers
coming to town, and the
Louisville, Notre Dame, Miami,
Temple and Penn State in
consecutive weekends.

With the aid of a movie camera
and a vocal coaching group, this
could well be the longest two
weeks of the year for the Panthers.

Time will tell if things in the
defense will get straightened out
or if opposing teams run amok
on the Panthers.

Steelers

Continued from page 9
on the afternoon. They were
successful every time, and once,
they did it in unique fashion.

On a fourth and 12 from their
own 48, Miami faked a punt and
back manjim Jensen hit tight end
Ferrell Edmunds over the middle
for a 51-yard gain to bring the
Dolphins all the way down to the
Steeler 21, setting up Smith’s
second TD.

“The fake punt — we practice
that, and today we just thought
the situation was there. We saw
all the things we thoughtwould
be successful, and we thought
their rush would be On. Everything
looked like a ‘go,’ so we went,”
Shula said.

Everything went whichever
way Shula wanted ..it to go. And
his players, instead of ripping
Pittsburgh’s offensive
effectiveness to shreds, chose to
blowtheir Own horns.

“You never know, in this league
everyone has talent; a Louie Li pps,
Bubby Brister, guys that can really
rack up points. And to come out
here and shut those guys down is
a complement to us,” said
defensive player of the game Tim
McKyer. Hey Tim — cut us a
break, big guy.

T O shut down an offense which
hasn’t scored a touchdown all
season isn’t exactly the greatest
measure of defensive success.
Maybe McKyer should keep his
cork on the champagne bottle a
little longer before he begins to
pat himself on the back.

Strong safety Jarvis Williams
was still thinking about last.year’s

Steeler triumph in the “Monsoon

Bowl.”

“Last year they came down to
Miami and pounded us. We felt
like they had a pretty good
offense, and we didn’t want to
take them lightly. They really
didn’t get going today. I think us

putting a lot of pressure on them
stopped them from being able to
get rolling. Last year they got
rolling, and it was hard to stop
them,” Williams said.

While your buddy Tim is at it,
you can cut us a break too, Jarvis.
Does the phrase “That was then,
this is now” ring a bell? Get a clue.
We’re talking about a team that
hasn’t scored in four games. One-
fourth of the season for you math
buffs.

Well, at least the Steelers are‘

being realistic. Brister has stopped
publically railing Joe Walton's
"offense, at least for the time being.

“We’re at a low ebb right now,
and we’ve just got to keep
working hard. It’s the same old
shit I’ve been saying every week,
you’ve got to work hard and
keep it up. We’re all down
because we know we can play
better," Brister said.

Asked for his version of what
he thinks is wrong with the
Steelers, Brister stayed out of it
altogether. He's cried wolf one
too many times. __,

“It doesn’t matter what I think.

offense in the scoring department, as the score stood at 35-24.
WVU kicker Brad Carroll nailed a 30-yard field goal with 4:30
remaining to post the final scoring on the afternoon.

The Pitt defense didn’t exactly have its day at the beach either.
Tailback Michael Beasley ripped through Pitt’s defensive front
en route to 135 yards and one touchdown in the first half. On
Beasley’s 10 rushing attempts in the half members of the Pitt
secondary had to bring him down six times, for Beasley left Pitt’s
line and its linebackers in the dust. ,

Defensive coordinator Fred vonAppen doesn’t exactly believe
that there is some complex problem with the defensive scheme.

“We just didn’t get off the blocks and make tackles. We were
in the position to make plays, and we simply didn’t make plays.
We didn’t tackle, which is a very basic fundamental in football.
Until we get better at that and play with [better] results, we’re
L going to struggle,” vonAppen said.

After the monumental rushing numbers posted against the
Panthers by Oklahoma and the Mountaineers, rush defense has
popped up as a major concern of the coaching staff.

“We have not stopped the run here since this coach’s arrival
[Hackett], and in the film I looked at last year we didn’t stop the

run. So there is something we do not do particularly well right
now, and we have to address ituntil we can get it slowed down.”

What concerns vonAppen is that the Sooners and the
Mountaineers have two different running styles. Oklahoma had

- tremendous perimeter speed running the option, and Pitt
simply could not keep up with it. West Virginia just ran the ball
“vertically” (translation: down our throat), and Pitt could not put

According to vonAppen, the inability to stop either running
style is a cause for concern. In fact, how many ways are there
to run the football?‘ Either you run somewhere through the

Barreto did not come into The
Great Race a virtual unknown to
running enthusiasts. He has been
running competitively for about
11 years. He has run in Tulsa,
Okla.; Birmingham, Ala.;
Huntsville, Ala .; and the Peachtree
10K in Atlanta, Ga. He also was a
member of the 1988 Mexican
Olympic team, running both the
five and the 10 K.

“I’m using The Great Race to
help me train for the Central
American Games to be held later
this year in Mexico City,” Barreto
said when asked about his future
racing plans.

When asked if he would like to
return to Pittsburgh for The Great
Race, Barreto responded he
would be happy to “if he were

_ invited to return.”

The women’s winner, Larrieu-
Smith, unlike Barreto of the men
was very pleased with her time of
31:45. “It was a [personal record]
for me in a road race,” she said.
“This course has a lot of downhill,
and it allows you to go faster,”
said Larrieu—Smith. “I tried to
push this race. After I gained the
lead on the first hill, I just kept
running and didn’t look back.”

Larrieu—Smith finished 1:23 in
front of Patty Murray, her closest
competitor. Last year’s winner
Elaine Vanblunk finished third
with a time of 32:43.

Larrieu—Smith, like Barreto, also
came into this race as a contender
to win. While she feels she is
faster on the track, she has been
running road races seriously since
1985. She has been running for a

total of 25 years. She is primarily
a five to 15K runner, but she
finished in second place in the
1990 London Marathon.

“I’m just coming into my peak.
This was my ﬁrst race of my
season. I ran a 10-mile race about
a month ago just as a training
check to see where I was. I have
about 10 more races yet to come,”
said Larrieu-Smith when asked
about her future plans.

In addition to her second—place
finish in London, she was a
member of the United States
Olympic team in 1972, 1976, 1980
and 1988. She has set American
records in track and field events
35 times.

While the rain may have made
the race a bit uncomfortable for
the fans, it was a welcomed event
for the participants. As the rain
fell, it cooled the hot and sweaty
participants and loosened the
atmosphere.

Runners joked and teased each
other as they made their way
toward a seemingly far-off goal.
One runner said, “I started about
two-thirds of the way back in the
pack and finished at the 54-minute
mark, but I'm not complaining. I
do this for the fun and the
exercise.” ’

This appeared to be the motive
for most of the 12,000 other
runners. While there were some
serious runners among the pack,
the majority did it for the fun and
the sense of accomplishment
achieved.

Among other sideshows, some
runners participated in the post-
race costume contest — some
dressing as clowns and even an
Indian chief in full headdress.
Indeed, the prize money was
definitely not the No. I aim for

for the behavior and consider the correct legal context - freedom
of speech and the Supreme Court’s deﬁnition of “fighting
words.” Sucessful strategies, models and approaches will be
highlighted as well as lists of selected readings and resource

materials.  

The framework for this Teleconference which is the ﬁrst
of a two-part series on "Enhancing Campus Community"

is provided by taped remarks from Dr. Ernest Boyer and
excerpts from the report, ."Campus Life in Search of
Community" recently published by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Six
principles are set forth in the report and discussed by Dr.

Boyer as an "eﬁfective formula for day-to-day decision-
making on the campus" and which "deﬁne the kind of
community every college and university should strive to
be. " These principles are highlighted and used to set the
tone and focus the discussion for the teleconferences.

Sept. 26 A male entered the
Graduate School of Public Health
and asked the receptionist if he
could borrow a stapler. The
receptionist told him to try the
office at the end of the hall. The
male got angry and stormed out‘,
partially knocking the door off its
hinges. The police were notiﬁed
and removed the man from his
class. He was told that Judiciary
Board papers would be filed
against him, and that he should
watch his temper.

Sept. 27- The house manager

of a fraternity house reported to 

the police that one of the fraternity
members was repeatedly causing
problems. Such things as over
stuffing the toilets, and removing
striker plates from the doors were
among the problems. The man
was not present at the time and
when police went to find him in
his room they discovered
paraphenalia used for forging
driver's licenses. Charges will be
