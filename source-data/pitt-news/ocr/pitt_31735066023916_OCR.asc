University assumes responsibility if UHCP Defaults

Health Center Iannin

By SCOT STONE

Pitt News Staff Writer

The board of trustees passed a
resolution at their annual. fall

dollar University Health Center of
Pittsburgh [UHCP] bond issue. _
This means that -in case the‘health
center defaults on repayment of the .
bond the university would assume
responsibility for the debt.

The health center is planning to.
build a “shared services facility” in
the courtyard space behind Lothrop
Hall on Fifth Avenue,according to
the resolution. The process of
ﬁnancing the project has been ac-

celerated by passage of this resolu-
tion, but it still depends upon the '~

findings‘ of further studies. _

“We now have this resolution that
says we’re willing to talk,” said
Jack Freeman, senior vice
chancellor for administration,“but

then we have to complete two other ’

important projects: one is the ar-
chitectural design that tells us exact-

.ly how much they’ll have to bor-

row; and second is the financial
feasbility study, to see if this project
is financially feasible.” , _
The shared services facility, a‘
concept in centralizing and. coor-

laboratories and the radiology
center, arose out of a discussion

between members of the health‘

center on‘ Children’s Hospital’s

meeting to consider the universityplans to replace its pfeserit aging

was the guarantor of a $60 million

facility.

“One of the issues, raised by _
Presbyterian Hospital, is that we’re.

going to be the majorbuilding op-

portunity for the remaifnderiof the V -
. century,~let’s try to see what else we
can do with it,”said Joel Ettinger, ‘

assistantto the president of UHCP

facility. ' G .
According to Ettinger, it was

and director of planning for, the

_, then decided that the various shared

services, which are now scattered
over Oakland, should be con-
solidated in this courtyard area, in
‘addition to theexpansion of the
Children’s Hospital,

“Children’s Hospital has known
they would have to,_reno'vate_for
"many years, ”Ettinger said, “but the
joint planning component of the
shared facilities started in
February.’ ’ I

— Since then, the health center has
retained the First Boston Corpora-
tion as a bond counsel, and the Los
Angles law_ firm of Meme], Jacobs,
Pierno, and Gersh, to develop a
suitable corporate structure for the
facility. , '

Default Rate an Loans Drop;    

Federae lltegulations Cited

By PEGGY FERRI
' Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s student default rate on Na-

tional Direct Student

Loans

(NDSL) has dropped to eight per-
centthis year from a high three
years ago of 23 percent, a decrease
Pitt officials attribute to mandatory
federal loan. collection regulations
and utilization of an in house loan
collection office. The default rate is
the amount of loans not repayed.

It was “the support (of these
regulations and the use "of Pitt’s
own collection office that lowered
the default rate over the past three
years,” said Joe Gil, director of stu-
dent loans and special accounts at
Pitt. ’

e“It isn’t an arbitrary or
capricious-kind of thing on the in-
stitution’s part; we’re’following cer-
tain prescribed guidelines,” Gil ad-
ded.

Essentially, what the government
requires of loan officers is that they
pursue -collection of the account
through letters or telephone calls.
If the borrower's location is
unknown, then the collection agen-
cymust ‘ ‘skip-trace’ ’ the accountor
try to find the borrower, making
every legitimate effort to collect the
amount, includingtaking legal ac-
tion if the amount is in excess of
$500 according to Gil.

“It is the adherence to all aspects
of this mandatory procedure that
has lowered the default rate,” Gil
said. ‘

Loan program was founded in
1958; under it, a student can bor-

row as much as $5,000 for four-

years, repaying the loan at a three
percent interest rate. It is 90 per-if
cent financed by the federal govern-
ment while the rest is providedeby
the institution itself.

When the loan _is 120 days past

due, then the borrower is in default. V

Federal regulations concerning
default have been rewritten several
times, bufthe last revision is the one
that has helped the most to lower
the default rate. According.to sec-
tion 176 of the federal regulations,

the institution must demand pay-

ment as follows: .
-—telephone or write for pay-
ment. . 0 ii
—-if that information is not
known, trace the student;

—if the phone call is ignored,

then a letter; should be sent that

demonstrates a higher response
rate (mailgram). '

If those messages are ignored
then the institution. is obliged ttc
refer the account to a collectior
agency, and if there is still 11(-
response, the institution must suc
the borrower.

“Because of the special relation
ship that_exists between the institu
tion and its former students, rathe
than after 120 days turn the accouh
over to a collection agency, we exer
cised the option the governmen

allows us to have our own collectio: -

I By JMIKE MALLINGER
Pitt News Staff Writer
There has been “too much damn-
ed M/ar_,in one person’s lifetime,”
according to Albert Fitzgerald,
former president of the United
Electrical Workers Union, who
spoke at a" conference at Pitt on

O in  Saturday.‘

‘ Presently “millons of Americans
are going to make that trip to the

:,Post Office" (to register for the

-'draft). That's the part all of us
have to fight against,” Fitzgerald
saidat a conference titled “The
'_Draft and the New Militarism.”.
The conference was sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Committee Against
Registration and the Draft

 , (CARD). \

“We have to fight the whole
political system and its policies,”

I «Fitzgerald said, adding that he

preferred to- see money spent on

~;_“

transportation and housing “in a
-constructive way,” rather than on
defense. He said‘ that there. was
much‘ waste involved in defense
spending. up _

The United States supplies the
allies with arms and “we get excited
when they use them against each
other.” People should “rise up
against what’s happening,” Fit-
zgerald said. .

Fitzgerald expressed’ the opinion
that if’ students
perseverance to continue their out-
cry against the draft then the
“military spending movement”
would end. -

David Funkhauser, Chair of the
Nicaraguen Solidarity Committee,
discussed his concepts of United
States b intervention in Nicaragua
and El Salvador. _

He charged that America had
dominated Nicaragua and that US

have < the ,

J

domination‘ has ended. ,
“Nicaragrans are taking charge

-of their lives, their land, their

government,” Funkhauser said.

He charged that the United States.
“under the guise of development
assistance” had trained the
nation’s f‘repressive” secret police,
a training that terminated in 1974.
This was done purportedly to main-
tain law and order while those
police actually tortured and killed
in Nicaragua, Funkhauser ‘said.

He went on to charge that the US
had engineered a military coup in
Salvador and was responsible for
7,000 deaths due to its military sup— 7
port of ‘that country. This was
another’ instance of “disasterous
US policy,” Funkhauser said.

Daggett, a Ph.D. canidate in
political science from the University
of Michagan, spoke on the
likelihood of nuclear war with the

  T Registration and nrart Opposers righting

 

Soviet Union. ' r
0 He said'that_the United States
was in nuclear coinpet-ition with the
Soviets and that competition was
dangerous. It could result in
technical ventures leading to 21’ new
generation \of nuclear weapons,
more dangerous than multi-nuclear
ewarheaded missles.

Arms negotiations with the
Soviets had broken down and had
“esseritially" failed,” he said-
“Unless arms negotiations get on
track there is very little to be done.
It ‘creates an. extraordinary
danger,” Daggett said. ‘ ’

He- described a “nightmare
senario.” According to that senario
“both sides have an incentive to use
nuclear weapons before they are
destroyed.” Though this is unlikely
in‘ is an “immediate political
danger,” Daggett added. '

He said that "United States missles

Soviet Union. “You can’t hide
them,” he said. O - -

But the country could rest on the
fact that 77 per cent of its warheads
are not vulnerable, being placed on
submarines and bombers, he added.

Shank,a member of CARD since
April 1979, did not register for the

draft when he‘was 18 and was con- '

victed of draft evasion, then was
given three years probation.

Shank said he sees the draft as an
inevitable result of draft registra-

He pointed to the fact that
throughout history the American
people were anti—conscription. He
quoted Jefferson as saying that con-

scription was “the last of all op-T

pressions.” ‘

_“It is useful to know that the
overwhelming weight of history is
on our side,” he said.

First Boston, according to
Freeman, advised the health center
that the best means to float a bond
was to get the university to back it.

“They came forward with they

suggestion, that if the university
could in some way guarantee the
bonds, that it would give a higher
bond rating and hence a lower in-
terest ‘cost to the issue,”Freeman
said. -' ‘ e V

Financial feasibility is the other
side of the issue. The health center
is consulting’ with the law firm. of

to develop a corporate structure
that can best take advantage of

 More To_ Lose  
 .111anGaIn o

i- _._  i_. The Student Government Board (SGB) is only a 3 
5,. «ing for headaches by advocating a -merger of the da_y

and night school graduate bodies. —’

Through such a merger, the SGB stands to gain

~ A " "responsibility for a diverse group of students with "A

 distinct and seperate needs .. from other ,Pitt'

undergraduates, while College of General Studies

f  - students stand to lose a’ large chunk of their represen-
' tation. ‘

The question of a merger developed because last

‘  -year’s student activities fee hike resulted in seperate
O  I activities fees for day and night school students.’ CGS ’
 .  5 students, therefore, are now unable to participate in _

Pitt Program Council (PPC) programming at

' ‘undergraduate rates or take part in undergraduate.

‘ ‘We are opposed because we don’t believe a single

‘ undergraduate student government »would be able to -

represent the diverse interests of ‘ the evening
student,” CGS president Tom Hajduk said earlier
this year. ,

Bill Abraham, SGB president, and other SGB

 jmembers had expressed doubts that CGS cabinet

members’ were representing the feelings of night

students, and said the CGS officers were “un-

substantially opposed” to amerger. _ ‘
Recently, the CGS cabinet agreed to survey their

‘students to determine whether they would want 'such
. amerger. - -

IL.-may be likely that some CGS students would
welcome access to PPC programing. It may also be

‘ true that some CGS students feel night school pro-

gramming is inadequate.
A merger, however, is not the answer to these pro-
blems. , . P ; , \
CGS students would be inadequately served
without representation from their own

Eveningparking permits, opening up evening of-
ﬁce hours at Pitt and other CGS concerns can not be
dealt with by as student government that has its own
problems, ranging from an over-rated duplication
service to squabbling about the allocations process.

In addition,_ Abraham said the CGS would become .
a governance group upon merging. Theknight school 3

body in transition from,having its own government

to becoming a governance group, ' will lose much of '
~ its representation. ‘

J There are other methods besides a merger ‘to ad-
dress the problem Of, night’ school programming.

Perhaps CGS could contribute a percentage of
funds to PPC, therefore becoming eligible to attend
PPC programming without losing autonomy.

T \And the night school students could work to im-‘ J
' prove their own organizations and programming,

_since'PPC programming is geared mainly toward day
school students. , .
Through the CGS survey, the night school students

' will be able to voice exactly what they do want.
’ Before the night school student can decide, he
should be aware not only of what_he might gain, but

undergraduate government.‘ The ‘problems and ‘in-
terests of the night students areunlike those of other
. Pitt undergraduates.

 opposition to a merger. -

work which turned out‘ to be inade-

quate or unsatisfactory? Even if
you‘ haven't been in one of these

situations, no doubt at one time you

have felt cheated ”oy a particular

ing explains how. you can sue for the

amount of money you feel someone

caused you to lose, without going to

the expense of hiring a lawyer or

getting involved, in complicated and

expensive legal tangles.

. You may file suit with a District
Justice if you have a complaint
against aperson or store and wish
to recover an amount of money

which totals less than $1,000. lf .

you win you will be reimbursed for
court costs. If you wish to sue for
more than $1,000 you must sue in
Common Pleas court, where you_

should have an attorney.

Your first stepis to ﬁle a com-
plaint which you can obtain from
the District Justjce’s office. You
must khow the name and address of
the partyyou are suing, the amount
of money you want to sue-for and a
statement of why you believe you
are entitled to this money.

Once you have filed the com-
plaint, the clerk will tell you when

‘days’ from,’ the time you file. “The

law requires that before the hearing
the other?‘ party must receive a copy
of theicomplaint which you filed
with the Justice. You can request
that the complaint be sent certified

_mail so there is proof that it was .

received. Sometimes, it is more
effective to have the complaint
delivered by the sheriff, although
there is an additional fee. The per-
son may not be home or may refuse
the letter, in which case. certified

‘ mail would be ineffective.

While waiting for the trial, gather
any relevant documents or papers
you wish to take to court with vou.
Line up some witnesses, if possible,
to help back up your story.

_ explain procedures to you. .JIf you

have any questions, do not be
afraid to ask them. You will be
given an opportunity to tell what
happened‘ to you. Take as much
time as is "necessary and use any

visual aids that may assist your ex- 

planation. The erson you are su-
ing» will also have a chance to tell his

-;--si’cle of the story. [The Justice will

make a decision based on the infor-
mation,he has heard. He may not
decide immediately. However, it
must be within 5 days. "

If the decision is favorable, be
sure to inquire how to collectthe
money., If the decision is not
favorable, you must decide if it is

worth spending the money appeal-
ing. You have 20 days to appeal the
judgment to the Common Pleas
Court. You must go to the county
court house to tell the prothonotary
‘E that you want to appeal”a case from
the District Justice Court. Then
you will fill out a “Notigeiof Intent
, to Appeal.” This form will be serv-
ed on both the other party andthe
Justice who made the decision. _

Since appeals are more com-
plicated, an attorney is advised at
this point. » However, if you have
any questions regarding either pro-
‘cedure, please do not hesitate to
contact the Legal Awareness office
and we will try to suggest what ac-
tion you should take.

Whereiin Hell  the Homecoming King?\

In keeping with the spirit of Pitt’s
Homecoming "80, this is a
Homecoming ’80 question for the
editor. _ J

Who in hell was homecoming
king? On» Monday, October 20 a
picture was run of. homecoming’

-queen Desiree Jefferson and her
‘mother, not

‘ Chester Ray, xthe
elected homecoming king, but her
mother. Granted, she did give_birth

 

the event.

Toadd insult to injury, the front ‘
page of the Wednesday, October 22
Pitt News is emblazoned with the
words “Homecoming '80”. The
homecoming king and queen are
nowhere to-be seen.

I ‘realize that the photography

"editor has a certain number of .
photos, to choose from for each ‘
issuie.-sI__f he waswwincludingphotos of ‘-

   
      

_ ed to_ theking and queen, around
gwhom all of the festivities revolve?

Far beit from me, to judge the
editor’s reasoning for the omission,
but as an interested observer and a
member of Pitt’s growing black
community, Ml think that an ex-
planation is in order.

How about it? _ ,

It

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor
The cloud cover; cold *

temperatures and chilling winds
were perhaps an indication to the
mostly orange-clad 94,008 Ten-
nessee partisans at Neyland-
Stadium that his was not to be their
day. When the sun finally broke
/through, it shined only on the Pan-
thers as Pitt soundly defeated the"
Volunteers by a score of 30-6.

“This was not a match-up bet-
ween me and Majors,” said Pitt
head" coach Jackie Sherrill as he had
been saying all week‘ long. “The
players did the playing and our guys
did extremely well.”

Saying that Pitt played “extreme-
ly well” is probably the understate-
ment of the year. The Panthers’
ferocious defense limited Tennessee
to a mere 38 yards rushing on 38 at-
tempts. The joke on the trip back‘~to— _
Pittsburgh was that the defense
turned the Vols into a chorus line;
forcing their offense into a pattern
of 1:2-3-kick. In fact, Tennessee’s
initial first down didn’t come until
about two and a half minutes had
passed in the second quarter.

On Pitt’s first possession of the
day, starting quarterback Rick
Trocano had Pitt on the move with
an early running game. Tailback
Joe McCall and fullback Randy
McMillan ran the first three plays of
the game for 16 yards and the Pan-
thers were on the move.

After two incomplete passes by

Trocano and a penalty, Trocano, \

on a third and 15, found split end

— Willie Collier over the middle for a

.24 yard gain and a first down.
However, Tennessee’s Wilbert
Jones and Greg Gaines
simultaneously hit the " Panther
reciever and ‘jarred the bal1\loi)se.
Left end Mike Casteel recovered for
‘the Vols first break of the game, but
Tennessee couldn’t move‘ the ball

and had to punt. —
After another exchange of punts,

Trocano started‘ another Panther
drive that once again mixed his
passing with the running of
McMillan. The key plays in the
drive were on a second and six from
near mid-field when Trocano was
chased out of the pocket and
managed to run for 10 yards’ and
the first down.‘ Three plays later,
on a second and 13, Trocano hit 3
Collier _for a 15-yard gain which
set the stage for Dave Trout’s
39-yard field goal to give Pitt a
3-0 lead with just under four
minutes to play in the quarter.

On the ensuing kick-off, Ten-
nessee fans had their only real
chance to celebrate when Willie,

_ CLEVELAND -Brian Sipe sliced
‘ the Pittsburgh Steelers defense for
349 yards and four touchdowns, in-
cluding an 18-yard garne-winner to
Ozzie Newsome in the fourth
quarter, as the Cleveland Browns
handed the Steelers their third
straight loss 27-26 yeasterday g
,,Pi_ttsburgh, playing without the ser-
vices of injured quarterback Terry
Bradshaw, runningback Franco
-Harris, and a number of other
starters, led throughout the game

 Volunteers Surrenderto Pitt,30-6    

Quarterback Fiick.Trocan_o (right) led the Panthers to an impressive _30-6 victory over Tennessee

Saturday while freshman.Joe McCall was Pitt’s leading ground gainer with 89 yards, against

‘Gault, standingon his own- goal-
line, recievedg Trout’s kick and
“returned it 100 yards for a
touchdown and a’ 6-3 Volunteer
lead. It took Gault only 12 seconds
to dipsey-doodle through the Pitt
coverage and sprint the last 70 yards
of the run untouched; The point-
after attempt was missedias the"
snap from center was low and
couldn’t be handled.
Despite trailing at-the end of the

quarter, Pitt was clearly in control .

of the game as both the offe_nsive
and defensive lines were dominating
the line of scrimmage.

“The defense shut them (Ten-
nessee) down,’_’ said Sherrill, “and
the offensivedine did a great job
blocking. _ We isolated (Jim)
Noonan to keep him out of the

eluding scoring tosses to Newsome,

plays. _This was the second straight
week that the offensive line has
been intact. They’re the hestin the

' country at protecting the passer.”..

Pitt ran off 30 offensive plays in
the fist quarter as compared to on-
ly 7 for Tennessee. The Panthers
had the football for over 17 minutes
to little more than two for the Vols.

Following the kick-off return by
Gault, Pitt got the-ball back on its
own 20 and immediately began to
drive. Two plays later, Trocano
had the Panthers near mid-field,
thanks to a 22 yard strike to Collier.
Seven plays later, Pitt wasfaced

with a fourth and inches on Ten-,

nessee’s 15 yard-line as the, first
quarter ended.

Sherrill decided to go for it and
on the first play of the second

Pruitt hauled in a 7-yard score

Calvin Hill and ‘a pair to Greg with nine minutes,remaining in the

Pruitt.

The Browns trailed-‘by 6 at the
half and fell behind 20-7 early in the
third period, as Steelers backup

quarterback Cliff Stoudt directed a

Pittsburgh its
touchdown.

Sidney Thomton’s 2-yard scoring
run gave’ the Steelers a"26-I4 edge
when Matt Bahr’s conversion kick
bounced off the left upright, prov-
ing eventually to be the difference
in the game: i

to second

Sipe’s 6-yard completion to

game for Newsome’s game-winner.

The Steelers ‘ capitalized on
Cleveland errors to take a 13-7 edge
at halftime. . _ .-

Greg Hawthorned scored on‘a 1
yard run, following a Browns pass
interference in the end zone, and
Bahr hit on field goals of 27 and 22
yards to cap drives aided by
Cleveland infractions. '

The Browns scored in the second
quarter as Sipe hit on seven straight
passes, the last, _ one a 5-yard
touchdown drilled betwgen two.

‘period, Joe -McCall dove for the

first down. McCall then proceeded
to score the touchdown on two
more runs, giving ‘Pitt a 9-6 lead
early in the q\1arter. iWhen the Pan-
thers tried their trick two-point con-
version by giving the bal1'to Ricky»
Jackson’, nobody was fooled and .
the Vols stopped it.  -

Pitt’s next possession resulted in
Trocano throwing his only intercep-
tion of the day. On second and
eight, the Pitt quarterback was
looking for Collier near the right
..side1ine,-But theball was tipped and
linebacker Mark Burns caught it
just before it hit the ground.

No damage was done as the
‘defense held the Vols and Warren
was once‘ again called in to punt.

The Steelers had not lost /three in
a row since 1976, which was also
jthe last time the Browns defeated
them. 8 ‘

Bradshaw, out with a jammed —
right thumb, failed to start for the
first time in 64 games. But Stoudt
filled in admirable by hitting on 18
of 37 passes for 310 yards.

His longest completion was a
72-yarder to Thee Bell, which set up
Thorton’s score.

Once the Browns had gone, in
front, however, Stoudt threw his
only interception of the day with
1:57 ‘left to kill Pittsburgh's ﬁnal
realisticchaﬁce to come back.

This weekend the Pantherette
volley ball team took" second place
in a 20 team tournament at Univer-
sity of Maryland. The Pantherettes
beat, Penn State and Rutgers to get
into the finals but lost in the end to
North Carolina [15-12,10-15,9-15]‘.
Pitt’s match record for the season
stands at 34-10. ‘ ‘g

“ We played very uninspired
volleyball in our first few games,”
Pantherette coach Shelton Collier
g;Td,“and_ we had a few team
meetings and did some soul sear-
ching, and came back to make it to
the finals.”

According to Collier there were
six players - whose contributions
were outstanding at the tourna-
ment. Sophmore setter Julie Gaul,
who has won the starting setter
position from the bench, Robin
Kukalis and Ieva Berzins, Paula
Olsen, the top spiker for the tourna-
ment, and Linda Stadler and Peggy
McCarthy. . ‘

“Those six, Collier said, “have

evolved as our starting unit.”

Last week, Collier predicted a
tough time with North Carolina,
and as it turned out they made it to
the finals, and eventually won the
tournament. '

t “I think the word that ‘describes
North Carolina,” Collier said,“is
scrappy.”'Fhey’re a very scrappy ~
team. They ‘throw their bodies

the ball in play.

“A team like that?’ Collier add-_
ed, ” always gives a more organized]
power team, like us, trouble.”«._ T

" Collier characterized the matches
against Penn State and Rutgers in:
the quarter and semi-final rounds as ,
physically and mentally draining. -
Pit‘t’defe_ated Penn in the quarters
with scores of 15-15, 15-11, and ,
15-12. Right after that, they had to \
play Rutgers, defeating them in the
semi-final round L 1_5-ll, 11-15,
15-13. C y, 't’

“Both of those/matches‘ were
typical for Rutgers and; Penn‘
State/‘Collier said, coming right
down to the wire. Our teamhad to
fight hard for those victories, and _,
then right afterwards “they had to...
go right into the finals. 1 think by
that time that we physically" and
emotionally ‘drained’. ” A

In spite of the second place
ﬁnish, Collier believes that his team
is coming together and improving.

“After the first part, when we*

play” Collier said. .“Our game is

coming together well,_ the team is

that we’ll‘haye..to faceiin the na-
tionals.” S ' 5

Volunteers- Surrelndgeri lo Panther Forces, 30-6

5 (Continued from page I 0)

Tennessee then had its best drive
of the day as Vol quarterback Jeff
Olszewski direeted the offense to
four first downs in moving the Vols
from their own 20 to the Pitt 36.
Then on a fourth and one, Olsewski
on a—keeper got the first down to
keep the drive going with less than a
minute in the half. But Pittheld,
again as Sal Sunseri intercepted
O_lsewski’s next pass with 17
seconds left to preserve the Pitt lead

.1 éoring into the half.

Pitt recieved the opening kick-off

of the half and Trocano‘began mov-

ing the team from the Pitt 20. The
Panthers moved to the Tennessee 34
yard-line in seven plays only to have
the drive stall out asia result of two
incomplete passes. Dave Trout
then came in to attempta 51 yard
field goal against the wind but it fell
way short.

Neither team mounted much of a
threat during the third quarter as it

ended with the score still at 16-6 in V.

favor of the Panthers. Pitt did have
another scoring opportunity on
their next possession only to have
Joe McCall fumble-at the Volunteer
21 yard-line. One play before,

‘Trocano, made the Tennessee

. ting avscreen left to McCall, who .

rambled 27 yards‘ to put the Pan‘-'
thers in striking position. But-
Gaines recovered the fumble which
ended Pitt’s scoring threat. '

Early in the final quarter, ' Ten-
nessee drove to the Pitt 32-yard line

on the strength of back-up quarter-"

Passes of 9_, ll, 16, 16, and I0 yards
-—put the Vols infield goalrange for
placekicker Alan Duncan. His
40-yard attempt was low and wide
right so the score remained 16-6.
At this point, Pitt seemed to want
. to let the Vols get back in the game
because on the Panthers’ second
play, following an 18-yard gain by
McCall, Trocano found Collier
wide open as he had been all day for
a 21-yard pass but for the second
time, Collier fumbled and Ten-
nessee had the ball again. But‘ after
five plays, the .Vols had to give the

ball up again as Pitt’s defense began I
-to harrass Alatorre as _they had -

Olszewski.

\.

, . l _ ;
Pitt’s following possession didn’t

get going and Dave Heppler booted ‘

3 41—Y3fdet that Vol reciever
Gault fumbled and Pitt’s Pat Mc-
Quaide recovered on the Tennessee
\44-yard line. After Pitt gotta first
down at the Vol 31-yard line,

Trocano tried. to hand _off to

McMillan but the fullback wasn't
there so Trocano ,split the defense
up the ‘middle and ran for the
'31-yard touchdown. Trout’s con-
version made it 23-6. /

“That play was a hand-off to the '

right side and Mac vs/“ent left,” said
Trocano, “so I went up the middle
and there was daylight.” ” ~

“This young man (Trocano) has
done everything l’ve ever asked him
t0 '10.” said Sherrill. “You can't

expect anything more than what he _

has given us.” ‘

Pitt’s ﬁnal touchdown‘ of the
game came when linebacker Mark
Reichard intercepted Alatorre at the

Vol~'25-yard ' line. Five plays’ later; L

Pitt’s impressive victory by a score
of 30-6. ‘

Although the team played ex-'
tremely well all game, the day;
belonged to Trocano. ”

“Majors recruited me and7 when
heleft for Tennessee, ‘I was going to
go with him, but the offer never
came,” said the senior quarterback.
“I always ‘remembered it and
wantedgto do something about it.

E “‘But I ended at, the» school I

wanted. to ‘be at (Pitt),” be con- I

tinued. “I wanted to be able to
throwthe football. The offensive
line played super. _ I can't thank
them enough.” \.

Sherrill added more praise for his
quarterback by saying,‘fI respect

" him very much, he’s a winner.

Whatever he wants to do, I'll do it
for him.”

Even though Sherrill played
down the game-as a meeting bet-

ween himself and Majors, there was r

a special kind .of satisfaction about
this win. As the coach said, “This is
the biggest win we've ever had.”
gest win we've ever had.”

PITT NOTES:Pitt had its most
balanced offense of the season,
rushing for 252 yards and passing
for 237 yards... The only weakness
the Panthers exhibited was continu-
ing to fumble the ball. What was
different,. however, W88.’ that the
fumbles were forced by hard hits...
Pitt had 25 first downs compared to
Tennessee’s 12... The offensivellne
blocked so effectively that the Pan-

\

_ ther runners lost ‘only five yards

rushing all game...‘ McCall and
McMillan lead Pitt runners with 91
and 84 yards respectively...
Trocano ran for 76 yards and 10
carries... Defensively, Ricky
Jackson, Carlton Williamson and
Sunseri led Pitt with 8-tackles each.

Hugh Green had ‘seven... The Pan- '

thers allowed a mere 177 yards total
offense and an average of only 2.7
yards per play against the Volunteer
offense... Pitt will next travel to
Syracuse to play the eastern rival
Orangemen. And that game may be
,1-egionally televised by ABC as part
of a double-header... The game
took on extra meaning because
representatives from 10 bowls were
present, including the Gator,

. Tangerine, Liberty, Hall of Fame

and Sugar.

When the Tennessee head
coaching job Opened UP f011°W‘
ing the 1976 season, Volunteer.
officials wasted no time trying
to lure Majors away. It didn't
take much effort either. Majors
returned home to Knoxville
amidst the cheers ofj the lTen-
~nessee fans. He was to be the‘

man to return Tennesse football
to its former winnin_g»'WaYS-
Perhaps, too,.the fans 80‘ 3 _
little ‘carried ’éWaY- Aft?’ 3“!
Majors had just come from a A
.. winning team and the people of

   

Knoxville expected their hero to
‘bring little Tony Dorsett’s, Al

_Chesley’s, Randy Holloway’s

and Matt Cavanaugh’s with
him. Despite his warningsto the -
contrary, fans had high expecta-

‘L tions for theirteam.

for the first time since 1974.
Last season there was also an
emotional victory over Notre
Dame by the resounding score
of 40-18 and the Vols were able
to defeat conference’ rival
Auburn for the first time since
1975. But for Volunteer fans it’s
too little, too’ slowly. _ V
Overall at Tennessee, Majors’_
coaching record now stands at
’l9-21-1. This season, the team is
a very disappointing 3-4 and has
lost one again to arch-rival
Alabama. The Vols haven't
beaten the Tide in a decade. ‘

The Mexican national all-stars
hadn’.t lost since i1977~,and the
Titans of Westminster, iPa., had
crossed half a continent to play the
game. ‘ '

But Westminster came away with
a 20-3 victory Saturday in an ex-
hibition small college football game
that broke Mexico’s 39 game win
streak. I I

Mexico_opened the scoring in the
first quarter with a 20-yard 
goal by Ramon Zota and held’
Westminster scoreless through the
first three quarters.’

But the Titans quickly converted
three turnovers into touchdowns.

In other cold‘, muddy western
-Pennsylvania small college games
Saturday, offensive lineman Joe
Goldcamp recovered a fumble in
the endzone to give
Carnegie—Me11on a 6-0 victory

r over John Carrol.

Patrick Frantz’s office is in the corner of the se-
cond floor of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
building, located on the corner of Wood Street
and the Boulevard of the Allies. It is surpris-
ingly businesslike for one who deals with /
ballet. The furniture consists of a blue couch,’
a coffee table, a chair, and a paper-strewn
desk. Mr. Frantz is casually dressed in a tan -
and pumpkin-colored sweater. "His hazel eyes
~ _ peered intently at me through his glasses.

He became artistic director of the Pittsburgh g
Ballet Theatre in February of 1978. His contract is for
five years and carries with it the ambition to build the
repertoire of the company to the extent 3that it can per-
form virtually any kind of ballet anywhere. ‘

Born in Paris, Mr. Frantz began his formal training at
the age of eight at the Paris Opera Ballet School,
simultaneously pursuing musical studies at the Paris Con-.
servatory. His parents enrolled him in the Opera school
after, at the age of seven, he spontaneously jumped ona

 " cafe table and began it improvise to the music. Some V p

Americans watching him advised his parents to expose him . .,

to serious classical training. Mr. Frantz speaks ‘

about his training: ’ '

SHOWCASE Magazine is
pleased to announce that it will
run an entertainment page within
The Pitt News. This page will ap—.
pear on Fridays, with the hope
that SHOWCASE will be able 1'0
bridge the gap in entertainment
by providing not only com-

prehensive coverage, but more
‘ frequent coverage of entertain-

ment events in the city of Pitt-
sburgh. Look" for the
SHOWCASE Entertainment
Page, starting this Friday and
every Friday in The Pitt News.

SHOWCASE would like to express
their thanks to Mary Kane, Walter
Watson and Peter -Karlovich for their
help in the production of this issue.
Special thanks to Mary McCaffery.

Dear Sirs: _ '

My capsule critique of SHOWCASE is that it's fine. It's all right. It does
it's job. That's also my primary criticism. .

SHOWCASE showcases concerts, films, albums, books, theatre, dance
and art as explained on the magazines's cover. And I guess, if you're new in
Pittsburgh, in need of guidebook, want a round-up of things to do, places
to go, people to see in the Steel City, SHOWCASE will tell you. It will give
you that sort of information. —

But what won't it give you? .

Excitement for one thing. An interesting or different‘ perspective, for
"another. _ ' .

For a publication like SHOWCASE to be valuable as any more than an
entertainment guide—I mean a publication that people want to read and
discuss—you have to forsake a good many of your reviews and dig out the
stories and the people behind the performances.‘ Anybody can write
reviews. Everybody usually will at one time or another in their lives. And,
as most critics will tell you, people hardly ‘care what critics have to say.
Especially in a magazine like SHOWCASE. Since your writers ‘are
unknown to your readers and since the influence of The Pitt News is, at
best, marginal, then there's ‘no reason to assume that your readers care ,
much about the value judgements your writers might make. Besides, one
review after another, no matter how well-written, becomes boring. Most
publications like SHOWCASE appeal to readers in a variety of different '
ways. . ~ .

Here are two suggestions. Go behind the scenes and focus on a person or
a group of people that writers usually ignore and people know nothing
about. The costumer at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre, for example. The
lighting designer at Stephen Foster, the editor of a film, the stage manager
of a local production, a member of a symphony orchestra or a local rock
band. And don't just interview them. You know: I walked up the’ stairs.
Harris was on the phone. He waved at me. I took a tour, etc. Anybody can
do that. Writers must learn to soak up the lives of the people about whom
they are writing. Spend a day or two days or three days with an actor who
drives a taxi during the day and rehearses in the evening. Show us the side
of .their personality we don't know. That's what a writer is supposed to do,
you know. Show our readers something s/ he doesn't know and could pro-
bably never find out. And I do mean show. Many of your writers lead me
to believe that the name of your publication should be changed to
TELLCASE. ' . ' ‘ ,

My second suggestion for SHOWCASE is that you should be assessing
the state of a particular facet of the world of entertainment in Pittsburgh
and on campus. How does Pittsburgh compare in theatre, rock music, film,
with cities of a similar size? What needs to be done by the city, the universi-
ty, the commonwealth, etc., to make the world of entertainment in the
Steel City more compelling. ' '

A I know‘. You'll say to me, in response, "This is all well and good, but how
in the hell do I get my writers to give three days of their busy lives to_
research a story about lighting designers or to ride around in a taxi with
some semi-professional actor? How do I convince them to ‘chase around the .
city and assess the quality of a dozen theatre groups?” I guess I'll cop-out
and say I'm not sure how to answer that question—except to point out to
you, so that you, as editor, can point out to them, that you shouldn't have
to convince them. That's how real writers work. There's no ‘other way to
gather the inforrnation- necessary to write a good story.

I "But I'm not -a real writer,‘ I'm astudent," I hear kids say.

You've,got to make them understand that being a student is not an ex-
cuse to work less than a_ real writer. Students must work just as hard, even
harder. And when they still don't produce a product as good as a profes-
sional, then you can say, ’'well 5/ he's only learning. S/he's'just a student."
But this excuse is only valid when they have put in their time, paid their
dues, busted their balls, etc.

Pioneer Dramatist Examines Unheard-Of Issues

By ].D. KLEINKE

A century ago, the world was a
massive clutter of rapidly changing ‘
values a_nd identities, spurred by the
outbreak of the industrial revolution
and the myriad of consequences it
wielded on a society in flux. Tradi-
tion bent and broke beneath the
heavy weight of social transforrna-
tion.

With its collapse came a perplex-
ing entanglement of the remnants of
an archaic social structure, twisted
irreparably out of shape.

And gazing through a curious
observer's eyes, a-Dane named
Henrik Ibsen ‘wrote plays reacting
to this great upheaval.

He, saw within this re-assemblance
of society, traditional roles which q
no longer belonged; roles which had
fallen prey to the social revolution
and were wholly residual. When left
in tact, he conjectured through his
drama, these roles would destroy
their superfluous inhabitants.

‘Stagnation within an archaic role,
will foment tragic consequences;
and to this point, he manipulates
his characters.’

Such is the case with Hedda
Gabler, currently running in the
‘University of Pittsburgh's Stephen
Foster Memorial. *

The season opener of the
Mainstage series sponsored by the
Pitt Theatre Arts Department, Hed-

' da Gabler is a biting tale of a lost
woman; a neurotic misfit with a
disagreeable knack for compelling ‘
others to their doom.

The play is an active criticism of
"a descendant of the old leisure class,
awkwardly interpolated into the
new "middle class living room. And
in the middle class living room, the
character of Hedda Gabler is as fit-
tingas a pope in a downtown ‘pool

hall. -

Written in 1890, Hedda Gabler is
perhaps Ibsen's most refined work
in terms of the credibility of the
characters’ reactions to each others’
social ‘roles, and in the subtleness of
the symbolism which he re-
introduced to the theater with his
earlier work.

- The situation is also perfectly
tailored for its particular outcome.
Where his Ghosts, Rosmersholm,
and A Doll's House seernalmost

contrived in realizing their thematic. -

aspirations, Hedda Gabler is
perfectly logical and consistent,
thereby delivering an even heavier
philosophical blow when Ibsen's
consequence is finally achieved.
Historically, Ibsen brough reality

to the stage. Where earlier
playwrights either glorified or ad-
monished idealized and overly im-
plicit ideas through traditional
theatrical styles, Ibsen pioneered the
realist tradition in the theater, open-
ing the gates to modern drama.

Soho's Opener

THE RUNNER STUMBLES
Directed by Ronnie Ostfield
Written by Milan Stilts
Soho Repertory Theatre‘
By IUSTINE DENNY

One of the best qualities of The Runner
Stumbles, the Soho Repertory Theatre's
current production, is its intensity. One
cannot help but be moved one way or
another by the deep current of emotion ed-

-dying through the atmosphere.

The script, according to the program,
was "suggested by an actual tum-of-the-
century murder trial for the murder of a
nun in Michigan.” The chief suspect'is a
priest by the name of Father Rivard. His ac-
count of all that took place before the
murder, as told to his lawyer in his cell,
comprises the main action through
numerous flashbacks. _

Roni Ostfield, directing this production,

must be commended on her advantageous ’

use of this dramatic device, playing an im-
portant part in the success of the play.
Firstly, it must be noted that although
there are some elements of suspense in the
storyline, the essence of the play is its
development of the relationship between
Father Rivard and Sister Rita, whom -he
allegedly murdered. This is effectively sup-
ported in that the cell scenes have been
restricted to a very small section of the per-
forming area while the time spent in their
actual performance has also been kept to a
minimum. Through the judicial use of
lighting and the flexibiltiy of the actors, the

frequent transitions from scene-to-scene

flowed quite smoothly and efficiently. .

, rying more about the plight of these two

people, than about the outcome of the trial.

How can the layperson identify with the
plight’ of two devout Catholics? Father
Rivard's basically impulsive and humanistic
nature causes him to infringe upon his

, superior’s authority thus causing him to be
transferred to a small country parish. I-Iis

efforts as a "worthy" priest are reflected in

work.

his sincere attempt to write a religious

In addition," he has transformed Mrs.

Shandig, his housekeeper, into a model of

Christian piousness.

A word must ‘be added for the cast.

Although James Gardner had to fill in for
' an ill actor on a week's notice, a few
criticisms must be made. I felt him to be

quite effective during the emotional scenes,

but I still felt that he failed to gain any real
insight into his character at other times.

This may be due to his seemingly "con-
scious" acting, rather than an actual real
relationship with other characters.
Although he handled his transitions well,
he was too often the culprit of hurried lines.

Both Barbara Whitney's and Elaine
Carlsen's characterizations were wonderful-
ly detailed and complete, the latter the

more polished of the two.

Despite shorter stage time, most of the '

supporting actors proved quite worthy of

praise.

_With a little more effort on the part of

James Gardner, Soho's first offering of the
season, The ‘Runner Stumbles» would be

QOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

_ \

He heightens this newfound reali-
ty with pertinently selective sym-
bolism, rounding and tempering his
already complex messages.

The paragon Ibsen's stylized sym-
bolism is his The Wild Duck, writ-
ten in 1884. It is the story of a fami-
ly living under the auspices of a
fundamentally understood lie, and
their eventual exposure by an in-
trusive, and stealthy protagonist.
The result is horrid.

In the play, Ibsen proposes that
living under such an illusion may be
more necessary than harmful. He
represents this with the wild duck,
which has been brought forth from
its watery hiding place by a hunter
to live quite unnaturally in the
”open."

Ibsen's plays, socially introspec-
tive as they are, reflect a pro-
gressive thinker, dangerously ahead
of his time. He. deals with pollu-
tion in Enemy of the People, with
syphillis and family lineage in
Ghosts, and materialism and success
and the intrinsic price paid for both
in The Master Builder.

In A Doll's House, we see the
primitive roots of feminism, an at-
titude a little less than popular in
‘the days of.Queen Victoria.

Which brings the spotlight back
to Hedda Gabler. Both Hedda and
another character, Thea Elvsted, are
representative of the women of their
day; the latter, a flexible and endur-
ing reflection of her changing role;
and Hedda, a lost soul caught in'the
antiquated social quagmires long
forgotten by a dynamic society.

The production of Hedda Gabler
at the Stephen Foster Memoriallwill
continue through November 8th.

It is a fascinating glimpse into
what was happening to the people
who changed with the eighties of
the former century, and may offer
one or two interesting re-appraisals
of our own "changing eighties."

souls unaccustomed to it. .

Being a native of the dance world, I had
gone into the production believing I knew
good dancers from bad, and poor produc-

_ tions from successes. However, my guests’

who had accompanied me to the show,
were not familiar with dance and were a lit-
tle skeptical about being ”bored to death."

But to their surprise——they weren't. In
fact, from the very minute the curtain rose
to the moment it dropped, what "danced”

its way past us was sheer entertainment and '

delight.

The unique and comic style of the group
was the reservoir from which they drew the
ideas to accomplish this performance. This
was evident through . the choice of
movements andtnumbers. ‘

The second act, the Graduation Ball, fell
a little short of its predecessors. The
choreography was not as light and playful
as it had been earlier, an aspect that made
the entire production appealing to the non-
dancer. In fact, if it hadn't been for the
comical characterization performed by
Kristen Schleich, it may have even been a
little boring.

All in all the dancing was not profes-

‘sional, but the spirit and the energy pro-

jected by the group made_ up for any lack
they had in technique. The choreography
was excellent and was the best I have seen
for college groups in along time.

  'Stardust Memories’: The Art OfBeing Woody Allen  

(G.

STARDUST MEMORIES
Written and directed by Woody Allen

By THOM PALMER

How is one supposed to feel after, seeing
Stardust Memories? Rebuffed by an uncar-
ing, arrogant intellectual? Although this
may be the initial reaction, it would hardly
seem logical.

I Woody Allen takes us in the same direc-
tion that he has in the past. And, as in the
past, he is not necessarily taking the same
road. Through film, Allen is assessing the
very wide open concepts of death, life, liv-
ing, and love by trying to reduce their
scope. This reduction is done with nar-
rative: narrative thatconcludes with a par-
tial answer and partial satisfaction on the
part of Allen. Annie Hall was an incredible
assualt on its audience, as Allen used his
humor to leave us wide open to absorb the
problamism of life around us. In his film, it

is alife of benign madness‘ that Allen zeros:
‘in on and inflates with humor. When, in

Annie Hall, Allen drags Marshal McLuhan
from behind the poster board and says, "If
life were only like this,” he captures the
essence of all his films. If we were all like
Woody Allen, and if our lives were all con-
structed with the cerebral finesse of his
films, maybe we would be able to draw
some conclusions -on the purposes of life
and love.

In Stardust Memories, Allen brings us the
closest to date .to the core of his psyche. A
major part of that core is his art, and not
only is his latest work intensely introspec-
tive, Allen also’ takes the liberty of in-
cluding us, in our most graphic and gro-
tesque forms.

I do not know Woody Allen. I don't

know how autobiographically accurate he
was with Stardust Memories. But I do
know myself, and I also know that I am not

' one of hollow, opinionless admirers or

mindless groupies that Allen has decorated
his film with. Yet I did not come away from
the film offended. Allen's grotesques were
not so much a cross-section as they were a
tiny fraction which he capitalized upon to
draw his story from. And through the
story, he constructs his film almost like ‘a
Platonic dialectic, a sustained intellectual
discourse of out-takes from his career.
Threaded throughout all this is Woody
Allen the human being, confronting himself
and his existence in a way that allows us to

see a small part of ourselves. We may not _

be intelligent, painfully artistic ' film-
makers", but the petty problems that Allen's
character Sandy Bates has from being
famous are superficial compared to the bat-
tles that surge inside of him. He looks for

meaning and therapy in his work as we .

look for meaning and therapy in ours. The

film's non-linear style jerks us back and .

forth between ‘conscious and preconscious

in a way that eliminates the ambivalence .

that exists in real life. He edits human ex-
perience and emotion to the positive and
negative, so that we may readily compare
our tips and downs, and look for the _con-
clusive, and elusiveanswer: Where are we
going and are the things we aredoing to get
there worthwhile? At one point in the film,
Bates seems to answer the question himself

without realizing it. Coming back to the H

Hotel Stardust late in the evening, a man
who was a schoolboy chum of Sandy Bates
waits for him in the lobby.

"I drive a taxi for a living," the friend
says.‘ 
"Well,»that’s okay," says Bates, "you're

healthy and you look happy. There's
nothing wrong with that.” ‘

It seems that Bates says nothing else in
the film as sincerely as that statement.
What is unsaid, though, is that Bates’ life is
so constantly analytical that he will never
be able to realize that -he is healthy and at
times happy. i / ‘

So the turmoil continues, on camera,
probably as well as off. Stardust Memories

« unparalleled in American cinema,

ends in a way that seems to have Woody
Allen saying, "I can only keep trying, but
people will never really understand me."
Maybe not, but one thing that is easy
enough to understand is that Allen's work is
and
whether Stardust Memories leaves one
enlightened or enraged, it cannot be denied
as one the finest jewels of film to appear in a
long time. I

Stigwood’s ‘Times Square’
Tips The Scale In Sleaze

- TIMES" SQUARE

Directed by
Screenplay by Iacob Brackman

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Robert Stigwood's been at it again. Why
he keeps churning out tawdry, tacky semi-
musicals is beyond me, or anyone else
who's had the misfortune of sitting through
one of them. His latest folly (Stigwood's
the producer) is Times Square,- a rather

disturbing story of,two teenagers on the

run.

‘The film is set around two main
characters, Pam ‘ (Trini Alvarada), the
daughter of a rich, important politician,
and Nicki (Robin Johnson), a wise-cracking
street girl who's always in trouble with the
law. They meet as roommates‘ at a

psychiatric hospital where Pam has gone to V

find out if she's going crazy, and where
Nicki has been sent to find out why she's
such a delinquent. Though the two girls
seém as different as night and day, they
somehow become friends and run away

the film._ Thereiare too many untruths -

about them and their situation. . Pam, for
example, becomes an un-topless dancer in a
sleazy strip joint, but appears to be totally

uncorrupted by the people and the at-~

mosphere there. Nicki especially enjoys
throwing t.v.'s off of roofs and watching
them crash to the sidewalk below, never
taking much care to see that she doesn't
hurt anyone. They both steal whenever
they feel like it, even going so far as to try a
gun-point hold up. We're probably suppos-
ed to look upon all of these things as mere
social metaphors indicative of something
deeper, but the meanings are never made
clear to us.’

With the exception of Trini Alvarada,

most of the actors turn‘ in poor perfor-'

mances, though in all fairness, it is pro-
bably only partly their fault. Curry is
especially annoying as the disc-jockey who
hates most of the world‘ for no apparent
reason. Robin Johnson's character is much
too obnoxious to elicit any audience

Guitarist ChetCatallo On The Science Of

By MICHAL BONINO

A. few years ago the only place
university students would have been
likely to encounter the term "spyro
gyra" would have been in a biology
text under the category of "One-
Celled Algae." Now most students
(and a whole lot of others) instantly
associate "Spyro Gyra" with
another kind of living organism: a
fusion band that's recording and
playing music that's pleasing all
kinds of tastes and audiences. Spyro
Gyra means music that's as
energetic, as happy and original as"
its name suggests.

"The main thing about this
band," says keyboard player Tom
Schuman, "is that it's honest, totally
honest. We write what we want.
We love what we write. And we
perform what we love. It's just _
honest 'forget-about-the-bad-times’
music." -

Before Spyro Gyra’s recent con-
cert here at the-Syria Mosque, Chet
Catallo, the band's guitarist, spoke
with me and discussed the band,
their music and its broad appeal
that defies fixed labels.

SHOWCASE: Do you think its part
of a new trend that the record com-
panies are promoting their jazz pro-
duct more now that people seem to
be turning more to jazz?
CATALLO: They're seeing it as a ‘
better seller. Us especially. We're

in Billboard, but I don't really like
to call our type of thing jazz
because it limits what category _
we're in. We cross over in so many
different areas. The elements in our
music are not just jazz. They're just
as much rock, just as much R 8: B
as anything else. I think they say
that because it's instrumental music,
but instrumental music isn't really
jazz. ' '
SHOWCASE: I noticed that your
music is played on all kinds of radic
stations. You do cut across a wide .
range.

CATALLO: Our last album when it
entered Billboard was reviewed in
the pop category, not the jazz
category because that's the type of
audience we reach. It's getting big- I
ger and bigger.

SHOWCASE: What would you at-
tribute it to that your music cuts
across so many areas?

CATALLO: It's a combination of
everything. First of all, we come
from backgrounds musically where
we played a lot of different types of
music. We grew up and played all
the different trends more or less.
The Beatles were coming out when I

the number one jazz group this year.

the production of Morning Dance.
This whole unit is relatively within
the last two years. That's when" the
whole thing really got successful.
Before that, lay Beckenstein, our
sax player, was together with a
whole different line-up in the band.
There wasn't really a solid band at
the time. They went through dif-
ferent people, and they'd incor-
porate different musicians. There
wasn't really a solid band until the
end of recording Morning Dance.
That's when we came _into the pic-
ture, and since then it's been the
same group of people. So Morning
Dance, Catching the Sun, and this-
new album Carnaval, that's the--real
Spyro Gyra. _

SHOWCASE: So you're really jell-
ing as a group.

CATALLO: Yeah, there's a lot of
talent in the band. Everybody
writes in the band. I've done some
writing, and other people in the .
band have written too. So there's a
lot of talent, not only as musicians,
but with writing. And the live per-
forrnances are getting together. All
of these things we're constantly
refining as we go along. Our

‘ _ writing abilities and playing abilities

are getting better and better.
SHOWCASE: Do you know
anything about Jay's selection of
"Spyro Gyra" as the title of the
band? ‘

CATALLO: It was just something .

 m

   
  

we're in."

that he grabbed out of a hat. He us-
ed it as a threat, I guess, saying that '
ifwe didn't think of a name, he was
going to call it "Spyro Gyra." So

that stuck and caught on. I
SHOWCASE: What would you tell
people who have never heard Spyro
Gyra’s music before’? To listen to

the music and just let it grow on
them?

Spyro Gyra

\

”I don't really like to call our, type of thing jazz because it limits what category

CATALLO: It doesn't take many '
listens for itto hit them. I'd say just
put it on. Give it a couple listens,
maybe have a glass of wine. Relax.
Do whatever you want to do,
because it's music for all occasions.
You can dance to it. You can party
to it. You can work to it. You can
make love to it. There's a song for
every occasion.

ANGEL CITY
The Decade
Oct. 18, 1980

By SAM MATTHEWS

I was beginning to think these guys were
cursed. _ _

On their first American tour last spring,

.(f\ngel City was slated to play the Decade.

(“When they arrived in Pittsburgh they found

that all their equipment was stolen, along
with their equipment truck by some very
thorough thieves. Needless to say, Angel
City didn't perform.

The second time is the charm, right?
When Angel City took the stage last Satur-
day night all finally seemed to be in their
favor. As they opened with a taut "No
Exit,” building the dynamics to the final
push, all power onstage ‘died. Exit stage left

- Angel City.

Then minutes later, with a revived stage,
Angel City returned rocking. Opening with
a powerhouse "I Ain't The One To Judge,"

Angel City displayed why they're _the
number one hard rock band of Australia.
Brothers Rick and John Brewster provided

Angel City

the necessary heavy metal vegematic guitar
drive, as the drums and base stayed solid,
never straying from the basic big beat. Bv

. . .displayed why they're the number one hard rock band of Australia.

Tuesday, octobefzs, T980—Page?

‘ Angel Socks Decade, Breaks ‘Pittsburgh Curse’

far Angel City's biggest asset was the vocals
and stage show of vocalist Doc Neeson.
Using the confines of the Decade to his
best advantage, Neeson entertained the
crowd by making them part of the show.
During "Shadow Boxer” Neeson bagan to
duke it out with a down-vested-heavy-

. metal-kid who had crowded by the P.A._

Although it looked as if the down vest was
intending to club Neeson in the chops: he
didn't, and Neeson continued to pummel
the individual throughout the guitar solo.
Later, a girl jumped on stage during the sets
only slow number, ’’I Just Want To Be With
You,” so" Neeson used the girl as a prop to
turn the tunes intent to unbridled lust. Dur-
ing "Marseilles" Neeson went for a tour of
the Decade by table top before he conclud-
ed the song by the backwall. Neeson's stage
persona recalls the glittery Boxie, decadent
Jagger, and host of generic hard rock
vocalists. ' '

The Angel City set was a good represen-

tation of their material with the emphasis

~ on» their Darkroom LP. They played thir-

teen songs. After all, thirteen is a lucky
number.

 Montrose's Guitar Precision Saves Lackluster Gamma

GAMMA
Mancini’s
October 17, 1980

By MARK MONAHAN

Colorado born Ronnie Montrose was
known in the 70's" as an extremely talented
sideman, session player and general overall
"guitar hero" after playing with some of the
real heavyweight figures of the era in-
cluding Van Morrison (Tupelo Honey, and
St. Dominic's Preview), Boz Scaggs, and

Edgar Winter (They Only Come Out at .

Night). ' . ~

\

After playing for alternating periods of
time with these musicians he formed his
own band, Montrose, in 1973 and proceed-
ed to crank out four albums worth of
material (Montrose, Paper Money, Warner
Brothers Presents Montrose,_ and lump on

It) all very much cut in the crotch.rock- .

heavy metal mode of the times.

Disgusted with the lack of success and-,,£_..¢g_____,,_

musical prowess of the band, he disbanded
the group to release several critically ac-
claimed solo albums which stiffed commer-
cially, but showed what Montrose was all
about as a serious and highly diverse musi-
cian capable of.rocking ‘the roof off of a

wding or of playinghighly complex and
fast jazz rock progressions. . ,

Where is this highly talented yet
unrecognized musician now? Well, judging
from his recent gig at Mancini’s, Montrose
seems to" have opted for a mid-range in
terms of musical direction. '

The group he now leads, Gamma, isn't
the. firebrancl rocking unit that Montrose
was, expecially when showman Sammy
Hager fronted the group's style of
music.Gamma is of a high energy nature
with tight and progressive arrangements
featuring Montrose on guitar, Jim Alcivar

on synthesizer and piano, Scotsman Davey
Pattison on vocals, Alan Fitzgerald on bass
and former Montrose drummer Denny Car-
massi.

The group played most of the cuts from
the groups two albums, Gamma I and
Gamma II and entertained a Mancini’s
crowd filled with hardcore Montrose fans.

What is noticeable about the band's star
and focal point, Montrose, is the incredible
talent and precision he possesses as a
guitarist. He's low-key but nonetheless ef-
fective mesmerizing the crowd with the
various shifts in soundand emotion.

Although the rest of’Gamma really did
nothing extraordinary, Montrose's guitar
work on "Razor King,” "Town Without Pi-
ty," "Voyager” and "Thunder and Light-
ning".was anything but, while "Ready For
Action," "Skin and Bone" and an old Mon-
trose tune, "Rock the Nation" featured
good efforts by the whole band.

In an interview after the show it was ob-
vious Montrose wasn't your run of the mill
typical guitarist gorging himself in booze
and drugs after the show, but if anything he
wanted to let it be known how seriously he
takes his music.

So be it.

Shipley Breaks Ice With Sincere, Torchy Performaﬁcei

ELLEN SHIPLEY
The Decade
Oct. 20, 1980

By THOM PALMER

Ellen Shipley had a job to do last Mon-
day night. She had to put on a show that
said, "I'm not just another chip from the
block of female rockers!" _ '

Her resume: a new album called Breaking
Through To The Ice Age.. Admittedly, her
credentials weren't all that impressive.- But

when Ellen took the Decade stage, the
clinical auditory ice of that LP seemed to
melt away. She was there—thawed, raw
and long—trying to belt out her torchy
point.

She struck a brilliant match underneath
the seats of her audience with her first three
numbers. "Heart to Heart," "Photogenic,"
and "This Little Girl," all from the new

album, provided a classy deluge for her in-

troduction. "Photogenic" was the best of
these. It was not so much her presence, but
the power of sincerity she launched into the
sparse crowd with every note she held.

Shipley slowed things down, ' perhaps too
much, with ”]amie,” and then tried to crank
things back up with ”Talk Don't Shout.” By
now, she had sung the entire first side of her
new album (in order) and had the audience
waitingfor the flip-side. .

But Shipley shifted to some older
material. Fortunately for her, she grabbed
the audience early with a strong start, for
the rest of the show lacked the attractive in-
tensity that once existed.

On thewhole, Shipley was a satisfying
show, and a surprising show, since
watching her live‘ shows how unflattering
her album depicts her, both physically and
vocally. "

I-low refreshing to watch a female rocker
without feeling the pre—occupa'tion of wan-
