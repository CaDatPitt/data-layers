Better Students May
Avert Draft, Dean Says

Emphasizing that in the future the armed services will place

high value on brainpower, Dean of Men T. W. Biddle this week
delivered a series of lectures concerning draft policy to Pitt

, men at Stephen Foster Memorial.

The Dean said that the services are aware that a great diver-
sity of abilities and talents are necessary to win the complex

Roy Titchworth then introduced a

  Open House

Sunday

Pitt will throw open its doors to
the public this Sunday during the
annual University Open House.

This year the Open House has
been planned as an integral part of
campus Pennsylvania Week cele-
brations.

From 2 to 6 p.m. students, their
parents, and the just-plain-curious
willhave achance to systematically
inspect campus buildings and equip-
ment.

Through faculty and student aides,
visitors will be able to meet in-
formally many of Pitt’s instructors
and administrators. The University
particularly desires to give the
parents of students an opportunity
to get acquainted with the many
phases of Pitt’s academic life.

All Pittsburghers, however, are
invited to see the internal workings
of Pittsburgh’s largest college.

As this year’s Open House is
part of Pennsylvania Week, the
general theme of the program will
be how the University serves Penn-
sylvania and the nation. Each de-
partment and school of the Univer-
sity has considered its contribution
to Pennsylvania’s history and fame.

wars of today.

As a result, tentative planning
indicates that future draft regula-
tions will provide for deferment of
"better” college students in all
fields.

Long Emergency Expected

Speaking informally to groups of
80 to 100 interested Pitt men, the
Dean said that authorities in Wash-
ington estimate that the present
emergency will last for 8 to 15
years, and are planning the na-
tions defenses accordingly.

Present armed services strength
is about one and one-half million
with the goal for June, 1951 set at
3 million, and for late summer of
1951 at 4 or 5 million.

Married Men May Go

The clean said present draft re-
gulations will not permit these
goals to be met, and as a result,
it will not be too long before draft-

.At present, Men's Council has
tﬁe room reserved up until 3 p.m.
every day. At that time they must
vacate the room so that the various
musical groups, including the bands
may rehearse. Robert L. Arthur,
director of the University bands,
said that “the bands would not
mind vacating the room if another
suitable room could be acquired.”

Titchworth had no comment on the
band situation but he did say that
"the administration is in favor of
the lounge and the Board ofTrustees
has appropriated $500 that can be
used for the project. There is also
a sum of$l200 from the Men’sCoun-

N otre Dame

Trains Full

More than 800 students and alumni
will be aboard the Panther-Irish
Special when it heads west for the
Notre Dame game on Nov. 11.

The heavy response to the ticket\
sales necessitated a split of the
Special into two separate trains, the
Panther Gold and the Panther Blue,
Both trains will be made up of air-
conditioned coaches with reclining
seats and at least one vacant bag-
gage car for dancing enroute.

The Special almost had an extra
passenger in its baggage car. The
Engineering and Mines Association
had planned to send its jalopy to
South Bend for the game, but lack of
accomodations at Notre Dame Sta-
dium and a minor break down will
keep the ancient jalopy confined to

the garage.

IF Plans
Aid; Mayor
Sends $25

By DICK KOVAR
and AL BIERMAN ‘

The ‘Send the Band to Notre
Dame’ snowball gathered momentum
this week as alumni,civic, and-stu-
dent leaders pledged support to the
campaign to raise $2500 for a non-
scheduled Pitt Band trip to South
Bend Nov. 11.

The first results of the Pitt News-
initiated campaign came Tuesday
when a check for ten dollars
arrived in the News office from
Pitt alumnus Dr. William McClel-
land. Dr. McClelland promised _that
he would contact at least ten more
loyal friends’ to follow suit.

His check was followed by one
from Mayor David L. Lawrence,
who contributed 325.

Dr. McClelland, in a letter to the
News, remarked:

“Certainly, the Pitt Band should
be at South Bend on Nov. 11th, not
only for the inspiration it gives the
team and its supporters, but also
for the opportunity it presents of
appearing before a television aud- .
ience of millions of our fellow Amer-
icans.”

Wednesday night Interfraternity
Council, at therequest of the News,
voted to set up a collection system
for student contributions. IF set
up a collection system for student
contributions. IF set as its goal the
entire $2500 needed to pay for the
trip. -

Campus-wide Collection Planned

A committee headed byPhiKappa
Joe Conner is making plans to
place contribution boxes at strate-
gic campus locations and provide
student campaigners to make col-
lections at entrances, in the halls
and Tuck Shops, and outside class-
rooms.

IF President Jim Morton, in an-
nouncing the fraternity group’s
willingness to take over the campus
campaign, stated:

“We feel that this is a splendid.
opportunity for the students to show
their appreciation of the band's
fine work and the recognition they
have brought the University. The
alumni have led the way, but the
main responsibility lies with the
students. Let's pitch in and do our

part to send the greatest band in
the country to Notre Dame."

A third plan for joint contribution
by alumni and students is currently
under discussion. It would provide
for a mass contribution to be made
at the Homecoming game with Miami
University, Oct. 28. Present plans
call for the distributionofenvelopes
at the stadium entrances, which
will be filled,signed and delivered
to student aides during halftime.
This plan, however, has not re-
ceived University approval as yet.

Extra Trip Asked

Leaders of the drive pointed out
that the Notre Dame excursion is
an extra trip, not originally in-
cluded on the band's itinerary or
budget. Popular demand, however,
prompted the News to ask for some
sort of general contribution to sup-
port the trip, which will enable the
band to appear before television
audiences and a record number of
Pitt supporters who are traveling to
South Bend by Special train.

Checks are still being received
in the Pitt News office, 825 C1-

In the event that the campaign
fails to reach $2500, Checks Will
returned by mail and individual
donations will be returned on re-
quest.The remainder will be turned
over to the Pitt Chest, Jim Morton
announced.

EXILED CZECH - Dr-

Cold War Is

Josef Macek, who escaped from his homeland,
Czechoslovakia, is now teaching three classes in economics at Pitt.
He was forced to escape because his political views were endangering

his safety. Dr. Macek is pictured in the Czechoslovakian roon.

Czech ‘Professor Says

Now “Hot”

" _ By ISABEL LUBOVSKY
The world 1S already at war,” Dr. Iosef Macek professor of

economics who escaped from his homeland in Czechoslovakia,

last December declared recently.

“You call it cold, but it is plenty hot. This war is not carried
on in the same formal way with a declaration, but the fact still re-
mains that it is war,” said the bearded scholar now teaching

three classes at Pift.

Dr. Macek believes that Russia
will not dare to declare formal war
because ‘of the discontent of her
people. "If the Soviet Union would
start war, I believe there would be a
revolution in her country,” he says.
According to Professor Macek there
is much persecution of the common
people in Russia.

Planned Attorney's Career

Dr. Macek was born in Moravia,
the central part of Czechoslovakia,
in 1887. When he was 24 hebegan
preparatory study for becoming an
attorney. He later switched to teach-
ing economics. For 24 years he was
professor of economics in the Tech-
nical University of Prague.

Since 1923 he also edited a Czech-
oslovakian monthly review, “Our
Era.” This is the game review that
was founded and edited by Macek’s
old friend, T.G. Masaryk, first presi-
dent of the Czechoslavkian republic.
The paper was stopped first by the
Germans in 1944, renewed after the
war and again discontinued in March

1949. _
Had to Retire

During the war Macek was in
forced retirement as were all pro-
fessors. He was examined by the
Gestapo several times.

Dr. Macek left his country because
his known anti-marxism endangered
his safety. One evening in December
at 8 p.m.’ Dr. Macek and his wife
started out walking toward the Amer-
ican zone in Germany. After they
arrived there at 3 a.m. they went to
the French zone where they were met
by their son. Later they got Canadian
visas and proceeded to Toronto.

The day after his escape, Dr.
Macek later learned two policemen
came to his home to arrest him.

When asked if he was happy to be
in this country, the Czech professor
smiled and said, "Happy is not a
strong enough word.”

 

Patronize Pitt News Advertisers

Ben Lichstein, photographer tak-
ing portrait pictures for the 1951
Owl, is glad that all Pitt students
don't have blue eyes.

Mr. Lichstein, who just finished
taking pictures for the Bradley Uni-
versity year book, estimated that
92.7 per cent of the students there
had blue eyes.

He figures that only 90.7 per cent
of Pitt students have blue eyes
though."It’s nice to see some black
and brown eyes,” he said.

Before taking up commerical
photography, he attended Brooklyn
Polytechnical Institute, he did some
work in chemical research for gen-
eral Food Corporation. “But then
my love for photography made me
switch my profession,” said the
35 year old Brooklynite.

While working here Mr. Lichstein
starts at 8:30 a.m. and continues
up until 12 p.m. in the Schenley
Room on the first floor of the Cath-
edral. This routine will last for
‘three more weeks.

Lichstein will make about 20,000
Owl -arintis while he is here.

According to Lichstein, the co-
operation that he has received from
Pitt students is outstanding,‘ and
has been of great help to him.

Meet Shift

Men’s Council has resigned it-
self to holding its meetings in the
evening.

At the regular meeting Tuesday
afternoon, President Roy Titch-
worth announced that the next
meeting of the Council will be held
Thursday, Oct. 26, at 5:30 p.m. Un-
der present conditions it is almost
impossible to have more than fif-
teen of the twenty members pre-
sent at any one meeting.

Another opening on the council
was created by the resignation of
Earl Jacob who was elected to Stu-
dent Congresslast week and decided
he could not hold down two jobs and
do justice to both.

Mixer Switched

It was decided that the Freshman
Mixer Dance scheduled for Nov. 9,
be switched to Nov. 8, so that frosh
who could not attend Thursday
dances would be able to attend at
least one of the events. I

A problem was brought up before
council by Ralph Douglas concern-
ing the Homecoming Dance at the

* Schenley Hotel Oct. 28. This is the

night of the Miami football game.
Student leaders from Miami had
planned to hold a dance for all Pitt
and Miami rooters at the William
Penn Hotel the same evening. At
present both sides are trying to
work out a plan that will bring both
affairs to the Schenley Hotel so that
neither will suffer from the competi-
tion of the other.

Albert ]ohnson,MC representative
from Ellsworth Center, reported on
the progress of the dink program at
Ellsworth.

He stated that in two of the fresh-
men orientation classes which he
checked for dinks he found 17 out
of 20 members in one class wear-

_ ing the dink and 9 out of 12 in an-

other class.

Boy Meets Girl

It was also suggested to bring
the EC students over to the Cath-
edral for a Mixer dance with the
co-eds here.

Ronald Ecker, manager of the
Council's bookstore, announcedthat
Panther auto tags are still on sale
at the Student Desk. Victor Kas-
mierski was appointed chairman of
a committee to promote the tags
and look into the idea of selling
other emblems such as pencils
and belt buckles.

Frosh Mixers Draw Crowds

Freshman mixer dances are “still
packing them in,” say mixer com-
mitteemen. Under the sponsorship
pf Men’s Council ‘and Women's
Self-Governing Association, the
frosh dances have been a complete
success.” So far the dances, which
have been held in 1217 Cl., have

lacked only one thing -- a little
more. room, according to mixer
officials.

The two and one-half hour dances
have been well attended by upper-

classmen. Also since the only ad-
mission to the dance is the frosh
dink, upper class members have
been borrowing the caps from fi'esh-
man and attending the affairs.

Summing up the whole affair,
Alberta Ignelzi and Jack Burwinkel,
coordinators from WSGA and Men’s
Council, said they "realized the
fine spirit of the Class of ’54 and
will try to fill all the freshman re-
quests.”

 Invitation

The University of Pittsburgh will open its doors this Sun-
day, Oct. 22 from 2 to 6 p.m. to the citizens of the City of Pitts-
_burgh and the entire University family. Students, in particular,
are asked to come and bring their families and friends, so that

 

the event will be a real ‘family party.’

Some areas not usually open to the general student body and
the public will be available for examination, along with all the
interesting exhibits normally open but unacces sible to the greater

- part of the public.

. Plan on making this Sunday a family affair at the University.

Send The Band

The growing support for the ‘Send the Band to Notre Dame’
drive has more value to it than just showing off the band to the
nation. It marks the first concerted effort of students and alumni
toward the common cause of making the, name PITT a byword in

college circles once more.

Not since the ‘golden era’ of Pitt football has there been
such unity of spirit among the Pitt students of yesterday and to-

day.

One of the prime movers of the drive is Pitt alumnus Dr.
William McClalland, who, after contributing $10 himself, began a
personal campaign among his friends for $10 apiece. This cam-
paign so far has been the sole source of alumni contributions,
although more are expected soon through the efforts of Alumni

V Secretary J. Clyde Barton.

On the student side, it is a real credit to IF Council that
they have volunteered to take over the difficult job of collecting
‘the student contributions for the drive. We hope that the rest of

School spirit isn't the only thing a student has to have to go
to Michigan State. It takes plenty of brawn, and a well developed
hatred of the rivals at the University of Michigan.

_ Proof of the requirements is the pressure being applied at the
University of Michigan for the installment of wooden goal posts

in the stadium. It seems the rough and tough State lads were too .

much for the three year old steel
north posts, in spite of the eight-
foot concrete base below.

The south posts, minus the con-
crete experiment, were evidently
just yanked up as a warmup exer-
cise. The late King Arthur must
have practiced up at State to be
able to have yanked Excalibur out
of its stone so easily.

Without doubt, all men up that
have five hours of Phys Ed.

Opportunlst Knocks

Reporter Thomas Strayer, rover
for Johnstown Center’s "Panther
Cub” is a versatile fellow. Owner
and operator of the Snack Bar, a
meet-’n-eat place near the Center,
Tom interviewed himself for.the
“Cub” and gave reporter Strayer a

llmmrnmm. What price free ad-
vertising, or, how far should a
young reporter go in putting a new
twist in his story?

According to popular opinion,
youth is supposed to be averse to
tradition, the old customs that
seem to tangle up their wild ways.

Osculutory Tendencies
At Wittenberg College, students
are doing their best to change this

opinion. Now that vandals have

practically burned their “Kissing
Bridge” to a mere shell of its for-
mer traditional self, students are
even more enthusiastic about it.
They visit the scene of the crime,
and tradition bound as they are,
still manage to carry on the prac-

big build-up for quotation in his

Pin Had Its
‘California
Incident’

by MYRON KOPELMAN

The case of California Univer-

I sity vs. Academic Freedom -- that

is, the school's demands that fac-
ulty members sign non-Communist
oaths -- has no doubt kindled a few
memories around Pitt.

For it was back in 1936 that Pitt
was the object of a similar charge
of endangering the standards and
liberties of the teaching profession.
At that time, the University took
exception to the actions and re-
marks of one Ralph Turner, a his-
tory professor, and dismissed him.

I was, of course, not here in
1936, but as nearly as I have been
able to learn, Turner was fired be-
cause of certain speeches and
papers which he authored.

Pressure Applied

In one instance, Turner opined
that members of the immigrant
groups were -prog ressing more
quickly than many of the descend-
ents of old line families. According
to reports, Scotch-Irish groups took
offense and applied considerable
pressure on the University.

Then, too, it claimed by some
that Turner was a bit too "leftish”
to be teaching in the schools.

The chancellor who fired Turner
was John C. Bowman, owner of a
reputation for being a terrific fund-
raiser. There is a line of thinking
which has it that Bowman feared
Pitt would have to lose funds or

' Turner. He chose to lose Turner.

Pitt Blacklisted

Bowman’s decision caused the
American Association ofUniversity
Professors to blacklist iPitt, and
that organization did not again re-
cognize the school until 1947.
During the 11 year blacklist period,
Rufus H. Fitzgerald took over the
chanc ellery and certain guafalntees
of tenure were made to Pitt pro-
fessors. No doubt these changes
restored the good favor of the
AAUP.

Currently, the AAUP is conduEt—
ing an “investigation” of the Cali-
fornia situation, in which many pro-
fessors have been fired for refusing
to sign the oaths. The California
case is similar to the Pitt case in
that a U. of C. faculty group, tlfe
Academic Assembly, has charged
that “a junior faculty member has
been fired for supposed political
and union activities . . .”

But more important, the basic
“academic freedom” issue is pre-
sent in reviews of both the Pitt and
California incidents.

So it is with especial interest
that many local educators are look-
ing forward to the report of the
AAUP investigators. _

Going back a few years into the
dusty dilapidated volumes of the
Pitt News we find the beginning of
many improvements which have

‘ added to the welfare of our Univer-

In April '38 Foster Memorial’s
stage, which was burned sixmonths
previously, was repaired . . . How
things have changed; J.G. Quick
announced that attendance rose
from 8675 to 9100 students . . . A
neat riot broke out between Pitt and
Tech and all because of agoalpost.
That week ended with Tech defeat-
ing the Panthers. After failing to
tear down the stadium goalpost
following the game, Tech bands
assembled in force Monday morning
to renew their attempt at the stad-

goalposts were well protected but
the Tartans unscrewed the goal-
posts at the practise field and went
home happy . . . Things have
quieted down since then. . . .About

Letters to the Editor

Editor,
The Pitt News

What with receiving it free during
a period when reading matter of any
breed is very welcome, it isn't
exactly cricket for an outsider to
take a slap -at the Pitt News. But
please interpret my statements as
objective criticism rather than super-
cilious sniping.

Certainly something more world-
shaking than the approval of
“Dinks” has occured at your uni-
versity during the past week -- cer-
tainly something of greater import
was available tospread on thehe‘ad-
line. It's probable that today’s crit-
ical and sometines condescending
attitude toward college students is
greatly contributed to when such a
Tom-Foolery topic as freshmen hats
is assigned the top position in the
official student organ of one of
America's larger colleges.

Not that I .don’t believe that
"Dinks” and the like have .~:ome-
thing to offer in the way of school
spirit, interest, etc. Such trivia has
an established value in most any
group or organization. But trivia’s
funiftion and value seem strictly
secondary — page 2 to 22 stuff.

Your “Wanted $2,500.00” in the
Pitt News of October 13th is timely
and well spoken.

Certainly, the Pitt band should
be at South Bend on November 11th,
not only for the inspiration it gives
the team and its supporters, but al-
so for the opportunity it presents
of appearing before a television
audience of millions of our fellow
Americans.

Here’s a ten dollar note to help
and I am contacting at least ten
more loyal friends to follow suit.
Surely, there must be 250 alumni in-
terested in spreading the fame of a
fine band and. a great university
throughout the nation. The public
relations angle,alone, is priceless.

Good luck and a pat on the back
for your "old college try” in bring-
ing this worthy cause to the atten-
tion of Pittites. , "

I am one of the college boys of
today who doesn't care whenit comes
to the smoke-filled room meetings
that are mistaken for politics, but
when the issue is Communism I will
take a definite stand against it and
I will campaign against it in every
way that I can.

The Board of Regents at the Uni-
versity of California has demanded
that faculty members sign non-Com-
munist oaths. This demand is entire-

.-

_one who deviates from the part

ly justified in View of the nature of
the Communist party. -7-’

Major political parties in the Uni-.
ted States have never requiredmem-
bers to pay dues or to uphold party}
views. The member is free to speak,/“_
vote, and act as he pleases. He does’
not take a pledge and he is free to
leave the party and return later if
he so desires. i
A member of the Communist party,
has joined under entirely different\
conditions. Everyone who is permitted.
to join is committed to every policy A
of the party. False cards and cre-
dentials have been issued and any.-;
line is purged and excluded. ’ A
Supreme Court Justice Robert H.

Jackson (70 Supt. Ct. 674. May 8; ':
1950) stated in regard to the law re- .\
quiring labor-union officers to sign,
non-Communist affadavits: "I_have
sometimes wondered why I must file‘ 5
papers showing I did not steal my V
car before I can get a license for it. ‘
But experience shows there are
thieves among automobile drivers, 2
and that there are communists among ’
labor leaders. The public welfare,‘
in identifying both, outweighs any
individual dignity.”

This can well be applied to the
faculty at the University of Califor-
nia. If any student in the United
States is willing to be taught by at.
known Communist then I agree with‘
Myron Kopelman that ". . .the innards
have disappeared from the American‘
college man.”

Are the Panthers Finally

Getting Mad?

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

One of the nicest things about last Saturday’s Pitt-Rice game
was-the sight of a referee marching off a 15-yard penalty against

Pitt for unnecessary roughness.

It is 1950 already, and I think
by this time it has been estab-
lished beyond doubt that football
games are not won by being polite
to the fellow on the other side of
the line. In the Duke and Ohio
State games, the Panthers were
ever so sweet to their adversaries,
the result being that said adver-
saries marched goalward almost
at will.

Frequently in the Rice game,
-however, spectators could detect
the meeting of knuckle and face.
And Pitt came much closer to win-
ning than it had all year.

Now I am not advocating a com-
plete slugfest such as that which
took place in lastyear’s Pitt-Minne-
sota game. When carried to that
extreme, football ceases to be a
sport. An exploded temper here
and there, nevertheless, is the
mark of a team which has its heart
in its game.

Three Chances for Fame

The Panthers have only three
more chances to pull a big upset and
salvage a little fame out of this lean
season—the Northwestern, Notre
Dame, and Michigan State games.

Even though the Miami Hurricanes
whipped Purdue, conqueror, of Notre
Dame, they have yet to convince the

ed in this year's [M basketball

reservations.

 

country that they are a major gridiron
power.

Tlmmons Sc outed Well

Last season Asst. Coach Bobby
Timmons did a masterful job of
scouting Northwestern ~- so much so
that the Panthers were almost able
to know what the Wildcats were
going to do before theenemy quarter-
back had given it a thought. Result:
Pitt 16, Northwestern, 7.

More than a few Panthers will re-
member how they surprised Chicago
scribes who had scoffed at their
being on the same field with North-
western. Panther memories may pro-
duce a little condifence tommorrow,
despite the fact that Pitt is again
a de c ided underdog.

At any rate, the Pitt News yogis,
recalling the '49 meeting, have gone
mad en masse and picked the Pan-
thers to win. But then, they don’t
have to put their money where their
months are.

Phi Eps Trim
Alphas, 18-6

Phi Epsilon Pi, touted as one of
the strongest teams in intramural
competiti.on,tool< the measure ofthe
Alpha PhiAlphas Tuesday by putting
together: three first-half TD’s to
win 18-6.

Mickey Steiner sparked the Phi
Ep play as he figured in eachscore,
though he made no points. Steiner
passed successfully to Al Fines-
man early in the first quarter for
the first touchdown of the game.

During the second period, the
Phi Eps scored twice more, as
Sam Shapiro took the ball from
Steiner on a spinner and snuck
five yards“to score. Gerson Green
made the last Ep touchdown on a
20-yard pass into the end zone by
Steiner to climax the Phi Ep at-
tack.

The second half wasthe scoring
property of the Alphas, as they did
the only crossing of the goal lines.
Once stalled at midfield, they took
over after an exchange of punts to
move 65 yards to their only score.
Russ Phillips completed to Henry
Heinz for’ the Alpha Phi Alpha
touchdown.

The Alphas were swamped in the
first half of this game, but found
their footing in the second half.

Frosh,JV’s

I Undefeated

While the Pitt frosh attempt to
make it two straight tomorrow when
they meet Kiski, the. Panther JV
squad has already hung up its sec-

_ ond victory of the season by down-
ing Geneva, 19-0, last Wednesday
at Geneva.

]oe O’Bara climaxed a second
half scoring spurt by the Panthers
after a scoreless first half. O’Bara
tallied twice on 40-yard and 20-yard
runs.

Bill Ewing, who took off with
the varsity today for Northwestern,
played an outstanding game on de-
fense.

Faculty Continues Supreme

As Diehards Edge °Y,’ 12-9

The faculty continues to show
supremacy over its students, but
the margin is getting slimmer. After
sliding by in their first game, 12-6,’
the FacultyDiehards narrgwly edged.
the YMCA Wednesday evening at
Schenley Oval by a score of 12-9.

Faculty Scores Twice

Both faculty touchdowns came in
the first half. The first was a pass

from Bigleo to Bill Grecco. Later a
buttonhook from Bill Rudoy to Bill
Webb gave the Diehards their final

score of the day.

After the ‘Y’ failed in a beautiful
opportunity, while on the one yard
line, the faculty fumbled in the end
zone .and handed the Wisemen two
points.

Wiseman Tally

On another occasion the faculty
men were on the giving end as they
tossed a pass which was inter-
cepted by Paul Turosek. A long
run and a touchdown resulted. The
extra point was converted.

had an undefeated football team that
laid claim to the national armed ser-
vices title. However, across the na-
tion, at Fort Lewis, Washington, an-
other gridiron force was undefeated,
and this squad also bellowed they
were the service champions.

That dispute was never settled.

Today, however, two men who
were involved in that argument are
currently classmates at Pitt. From
Fort Benning is lst Lt. ‘Jill Webb,
former line coach of the Benning
squad. Ready to argue Fort Lewis’
side ‘is News sports reporter Sam
Spatter. Spatter served as Sports
Editor of the Fort Lewis camp news-
paper during 1946.

Played For West Point

"We were the service champs that
year,”
hometown is Tarboro, N.C. and
clinched the title with a win over the
powerful El Toro Marine s.”

What Lt. Webb overlooks is that
Fort Lewis also owned a win over
those same El Toro Marines that
year.

Lt. Webb, however, did not confine
his football playing to Fort Benning.
During the 1940’s (43-44-45), Lt.
Webb_was a member of one of the
greatest army squads ever produced
at West Point. His backfield team-
mates, Glenn Davis and Doc Blan-
chard, gained most of the national
acclaim, for Webb was a tackle on
Army’s less-publicized forward wall.

Needles Spatter

The unheralded Bill Webb is cur-
rently an Army student at Pitt, study-
ing petroleum engineering. Although
not at his usual playing weight of
215 (he weighs 235), Lt. Webb is
once again back in harness on the
gridiron. Intramural spectators and
players have seen the 27-year-old
Army officer holding down one of
the various positions on the Faculty
Diehards entry.

Under the hammering at uments of
lst Lt. Webb, Spatter, a nd Lt. re-
servist, may eventually be forced to
concede the point. But then, Webb
not only outweighs him; he also out-
ranks him. A

Students to Participate

In Freedom

Crusade

B3’ LOIS FOIGHT

Through the efforts of the IF and Pan-Hellenic Councils, Pitt
was added this week to the lengthening list of United States col-
; leges and universities participating in the Crusade for Freedom,

’ launched by General Dwight D. Eisenhower on Labor Day.
Scrolls containing the declaration of freedom were circulated
_ in fraternity and sorority meetings, and are available for signa-

A ture at the Student Desk or the Dean

of Men’s office.

1 According to Lester G. Brailey,
assistant dean of men, enrollment
in the Crusade will be kept on an
organizational basis here; no Uni-
versity-wide efforts will be made.

Has Deans’ Approval
The Crusade was approved re-
«cently for student participation by
a faculty committee of undergrad-
uate deans. Signatures only are
approved, however, since con-
tributions for the expenses of Radio
Free Europe would conflict with the
current Pitt Chest fund campaign.
Contributions from other schools,
however, will go to help Radio Free
Europe in its work of supplementing
the Voice of America. '
Purpose of the Crusade is the
installment of a Freedom Bell on
the Rathaus Tower in Berlin’s
western sector which will ring daily
over the air waves as a “symbol of
the hope of freedom and peace de-
‘signed to encourage the oppressed
 peoples of the world.”
' Ceremony on UN Day
.On
Nations Day, Oct. 24 at noon,,the
ceremony dedicating the new bell
will take place.

the anniversary of United.

EC Selects
Dance Head

Morton Seltman, freshman from
Miami, Florida, has been chosen
chairman of the annual Ellsworth
Center Fall Dance, according to
Pat Airhart, chairman of the ap-
pointments committee of the Ells-
worth Center Student Council.

The dance will be held on Fri-
day, Nov. 17, with Don Belmont’s
orchestra providing the music.

GET YOUR PICTURE TAKEN

Any student who does not show
up for his picture appointment
with the Owl photographer is
risking the possibility of not
having his picture in the 1951
Owl, according to Jerry Simon,
Owl business manager. Since
the photographer is here for only
a limited time, preference will be
given to studetns who have not
yet made appointments. The
photographer will be ‘here for two
more weeks, after which it will
be impossible to get a picture
taken for the Owl.

Everything Unde.r‘Sun
Ordered by University

By PAULINE GRUBER

Have you ever wondered where the frog you dissected in Bi-
ologylab came from? Or where the Registrar’s Office got all those
cards you filled out at registration? Or where Dean Helen P. Rush
gets all the cookies she serves at her teas? These items are only
a few of many problems and purchases handled by the Purchasing

Department of the University.

Walter H. Stryker, purchasing ag-
ent, and his staff of three full time
workers and two part time student
workers, are kept busy trying to
fulfill the needs of the entire Uni-
versity. This department places
between 50 to 100 orders daily,
averaging 213,000 items a month.
Each of these orders is a story it-
self, for the purchasing department’s
shopping list is as varied as it is
big.

Their shopping list must read
something like ,this: 1 champion
potato peeler; 5 pounds mints; 1
gross medium size live frogs; 1
Aurora filecabinet; 23 dozen cookies;
6 monkey cages; 25 pounds tea; 1
tank of oxygen, and 100 cadavers
for use in the medical and dental
schools.

smallest single order the
purchasing department has ever
written up was for 1 paper finger, a
rubber thimble used for leafing
through papers, at ten cents. One of
the largest single orders placed
was for an ultracentrifuge that cost

$15,000.

Besides placing orders for items
ranging from mice to bed sheets, and
from porcupine pudding to micro-
scopes, the purchasing department
must check on all deliveries, keep
records of more than 1000 items that
are carried in the University stock-
room, and file tons of paper work,
