Chapel Offers
Carol Singing
Tomorrow

Students and faculty will join
the Chapel choir in singing some
of the old traditional carols at the
special Christmas service pre-
sented tomorrow as one of the
major chapel. services of the
school year.

As its part of the program, the
choir plans to sing “And The Trees
Do Moan,”, a Tennessee mountain
carol arranged by Harvey Gaul.
They will also present for the first
time “One Elect of Stars,” a new
anthem based on the “Come All
Ye Faithful” window. The music
for this song was written by The-
odore M. Finney, director of the
choir, and the lyrics by Doris
Jack, a former member of the
group, now a student in retail
training.

Dr. William R. Farmer, Univer-
sity chaplain, intends to center his
discussion around the question
“What Does Christmas Mean _To
You?”

As a feature of the program,
the Altar Guild, under the direc-
tion of Mrs. Edna T. Ba-tz, director
of the Pitt YWCA, plans to carry
in greens and candles to decorate
the altar.

At this service, an of‘t'ering will
be collected and given to the Fam-
ily Society of Pittsburgh, an or-
ganization which provides food
and clothing for the needy fami-
lies of the city.’ P
 Annabelle Montgomery, » vice-
‘president of the junior class, is
student leader for the traditional
event. Meinbers of Cwens will be
::stat..ioned at the door to serve as
ushers and hand out programs.

Since this is a major service. it

December‘ 3, 1946.
Editor, Pitt News;

What brings on the nonsensical A

column entitled “Notes on Notes”?
Is it a column about music? If
that is what it porports to be,
why doesn’t it print seine news?
I read this column for the ﬁrst
time on December 6. It started out
well enough (barring the poem),
but after the ﬁrst paragraph, the
rest of the column became dis-
tinctly familiar. The other topics
came, for the most part, from
rages one and two of an old copy
of Downbeat Magazine. As if this
isn’t bad enough, the two ar-
ticles are misquoted. Now maybe
it isn’t such a crime to revise and
edit some other magazine’s work,
but at least it could be copied
correctly. Certainly in a Univer-
sity the size of ours, there must
be someone capable of writing a
decent column that would be a
distinct interest to both classical
and '-azz music lovers. if at a loss
for anything else, you could run
periodic record reviews.

Sincerely,

Jacqueline Bowers and Jim Scannell, co-chairmen, talk over ticket
sales for this afternoon’s Christmas Tea dance, to be held in

Tell It To Student Congress
Through The Suggestion Box

In an eﬁort to combat the apathy of the student body, which
has been one of its greatest stumbling blocks, Student congress has
placed a Suggestion Box on the‘ ground ﬂoor. _

The box will remain near the clock until the end of the week.
At its ﬁrst meeting after the Christmas holiday, congress will dis-

cuss the suggestions submitted.

Through the Suggestion Box, Student

congress hopes to re-

establish its waning contact withe

the student body. In a year mark-
ed by bitter criticism from iso-
lated independents and disinterest
from the fraternities which once
carried the brunt of activities,
hopes that this move will rally
the student body to support its

actions.
The student body has indicated ‘

from its reaction to congress’ pro-
grams the general lack of spirit.
The demonstration block, won
after many battle with the ad-
ministration, failed partly because
the trained and responsible or-
ganizations were unable to get full
attendance.

The meager applications for
Spring Festival, the biggest stu-
dent-managed event of the school
year, bear out the apathetic
trend.

S‘h:llmE:;hibit
On Display
Until Jan. 4’

Never underestimate the power
of a seashell, for it may be more
than an object of color and bean-
ty. So says Mrs. Gretchen War-
ren, collector of the seashell ex-
hibit currently displayed on the
seventh ﬂoor. ,

If some contemporary theorists
are correct, man through the ages
has subconsciously patterned his
architecture, musical instruments,
costumes, machinery., and sciences
after the symmetrical design of
the seashell.

“Relatedness between nature
and man-made things” is the
theme of the exhibit, in which
the shells are arranged according
to color and shape, rather than
species. ‘

Mrs. Warren in her essay, “Art,

Nature, Education,” which accom- _

panics the exhibit, explains that
since everything on earth is re-
lated in rhythm and form, man
patterns his art and invention after
nature. He does this, not deliber-
ately, but subconsciously.

The hundreds of colorful, bizarre
shells are compared, by means of
photographs, to the designs of pro-
ducts of the human race through
the ages—-products such as cathe-
drals. cloisters, Buddha head-
dresses, and curved violin scrolls.

Spiral staircases, Moslem tow-
ers, the Temple of Diana, the geo-
metric hexagon, and the astro-
nomical constellation, Ursa Major,
are also likened to the patterns
of shells.

This exhibit of shells, spirals,
and photographs was first shown
at the Fogg’ Museum of Art, Har-
vard university. It is sponsored at
Pitt by the fine arts department,

and will be displayed until flan. 4.

Chi Rho ii;

To Reactivate

Chi Rho Nu, latest campus fra--

ternity to reactivate, has received
the approval of Men’s Fraternity
committee to proceed with it’s or-
ganization plans to “encourage ex-

’ cellence in pre-medical students.” -

Marvin Slavkin and Ted Scur1e-

. tis presented the petition to reor-

ganize to the Women’s Fraternity
committee also, and complete
plans are awaiting approval by
that group. The petition further
stated that the group will strive
to promote friendship and pro-
fessional interest among its mem-
bers. '

Chi Rho Nu went inactive dur-
in: the war, but now is re-opened
to all pre-med students with both
general scholastic and science rat-
ings of 2.0. When reactivated, Chi
Rho Nu will be a pledge chapter
of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the na-
tional honorary pre-medical fra-
ternity. Richard E. Fox, lecturer
in zoology in the biology depart-
ment and a member of the Car-
negie Museum entomology labora-
tory staﬂ, will sponsor the group.

Dr. W. S. McE1lroy, dean of the
School of Medicine, has offered
to aid the group by providing

speakers for banquets and other"

special events.

Prospective members should
contact Ned Maclntosh, fraterni-
ty advisor in the office of Dean
of Men.

Two Weekend Battles 

Butler and Illinois put a kink in Pitt ’s fatigue curve style-
of-play as they downed the Panthers on successive nights by

   
   

0

scores of 41-39 and 58-31. .

The ﬁgure eight offense———number one implement in -the
Carlson coaching techn1que—worked nicely against Butler’s
Bulldogs but the Panthers tired badly in the later stages. Butler
ivbounded back from a six-point.
halftime deﬁcit and went on to
eke out a two-point decision. .

During the second half, Butler "
clamped the halter on Dodo Can-
terna, limiting him to three points.
He popped in 17 points for the
evening to top‘, all scorers. Pitt
never regained its ﬁrst halfiform. '‘

Butler ﬁnally took the lead for
. good—with 50 second: remaining.
-—when Herod Toon dropped in a
free throw. ‘With .two seconds left, M
Jerry Cranny sank another free,
throw to make it, 41-39.
Whiz Kids Show Old Form

Illinois set up a tight defense, a
which held the Carlsonmen to ten 
points during the ﬁrst half. While
the Panthers were trying vainly
to play a deliberate game, the
Whiz Kids employed a fast break
to_pi1e' up a 31-10 halftime ad-
vantage.

Playing only half the game, the
Whiz kids punched-in 30 of the
58 points registered by the Illini.

Pitt Students Aid Lingnan University
7 Through Community Fund Drive

Dr. Winfield Describes Wartime
Experiences With Pitt-in-China

“Pitt in China," was the subject of an informal talk given last
week by Dr. G. F. Winﬁeld, recently returned from the Orient.

In his talk. Dr Winﬁeld told
students and faculty at Lingnan
is the University to wh.ich Pitt con
Fund. 1

The University's quota for this
support is only $125 a year, just
enough to pay a professor’s salary
for one month. “This is deﬁnitely
not charity,” stated Dr. Winﬁeld,
“it is sound business. The results
may not be evident in our genera-

In describing the movements of
the students during .\the war, Dr.
Winﬁeld explained: “Before Can-
ton was taken by the Japanese,
the students and faculty of Ling-
nan ﬁltered out to Hong Kong to
continue their studies. After Pearl
Harbor and the bombing and in-
vasion of Hong Kong, the students
and faculty who were not ‘irri-
prisoned, ﬂed to the small town
of Kuo Kong to the north. Their
stay there was eventually inter-
rupted by the advancing Japanese
armies, and they went under-
ground again until the war ended.

The 13 Christian colleges in Chi-
na, including Lingnan, have about
the same number of students as
Pitt and they represent 15 per
cent of all the colleges in that
country. Lingnan has educated 10
per cent of China’s doctors and
20 per cent of her agricultural
scientists. Dr. Winﬁeld also ex-
plained that.“China has only 200,-
000 college graduates, which is
one third of all the U. S. gradu-
ates in one year.‘?
