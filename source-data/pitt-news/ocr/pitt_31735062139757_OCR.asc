Committee’s
Hearing Open

Representative Hints Probe
Will Begin Friday,
End Saturday

Replace Shrock Today

House Speaker \Vilson G. Sarigi
today .will appoint. the ﬁfth mem-
ber of the University probing
committce to ﬁll the vacancy left
by the resignation. of Jacob B.
Scliroek, Somerset Republican.

Schrock 1'csig11ed last Thurs-
day, two days after the withdrawalé
of Charles Harnuitll of Bridgeville.
Schrock, as the only Republican on
the committee, was regarded asi
“friendly” towards the University.

In an interview with Representa-
"tive Homer S. Brown, Pittsburgh.
member of the committee, The Pitt?
News learned the probe probably will
be "open to the public.”

Mr. Brown said:

‘‘I see no reason why the hearing
should be secret. Its purpose is to

hear the evidence and clear the
University if it deserves to be
cleared.”

Mr, Brown, member of the. ’23 Law»
class and graduate of the Virginia‘
Union university of Richmond, said
the hearing “probably would be next
Friday.”

The legislature recesses Thursday,
allowing the committee time over the
week end. ‘

The legislator expected the probg to
be “brief.” After it is completed, the
committee will return to Harrisburg
and report to the appropriations com-
mittee.

Dr. Ralph, E- Turner, history profes-
sor whose ousting aroused “liberals”
throughout the state, will be called
before the committee, Chairman Eu-
gene A. Caputo said.

Dr, Turner, now in New York, said
he “will appear" if he is called.

Governor George H. Earle today
has on ﬁle a resolution from the Pitts-
burgh Central Labor Union urging
the appointment of Dr. Turner as
state superintendent of public in-
struction.

Governor Earle refused comment
when asked by The News whether he
was “seriously considering“ the rec-
ommendation.

Nashville, ‘Athens Of South’:

Banks, Goldberg Harangue Over Southern Radio Station
On International Shipment Of Arms

By Israel Goldberg
NASI-IVILLE, Tenn., lliarch 19.—The radio audience of the world heard
the Pitt debating team over \\'Sl\l today. At least so intimated the station

i manager.

Vanderbilt and the University representatives—~the Southern haranguers
who haven't yet decided whether to call themselves Merchants of Breath or
Braying Colonels——-were ﬁghting out international shipment of munitions be-

fore an undoubtedly invisible audience.

Banks and the author tried to n1ake%

it appear that they didnt like the
afﬁ1':n:-itive proposition, At times they
even upheld the negative, as per con-
tract. But they didn't let the little
argument spoil a. good time in the

l city.

“Ghost” Appears

In the radio studio arose a _L‘,‘ll0Sl;
of the old semi-weekly, Theis-Berman—
Knlltelz-Cuinmings Pitt News copy
desk Ray I--lhiel. Ray, who left for
Texas after he stopped paying tuition
at Pitt, is new writing continuity for
XVSM. He sends his regards to his
friends of the fourth estate.

Sorry that there are no other post.-
card messages to affix to this dis-
patch. Most of the people the men
have met know Pitt by the Cathedral
and by Dr. VV. M‘. Parrish‘s book,
“Reading Aloud.”

Nashville, it might as well be ad_ded,
is known as the Athens of the South.
11:‘ this hyberbole (the word is Coach
Richard Murpl_1y’s suggestion) con-
flicts with a name used in connection
with Lexington, Kentucky, several.
days ago, don’t;- mind it at all. The
South is a classical paradise.

So classical is it, in fact, that there
is in Centennial park here an exa.ct
reproduction of the Parthenon, per-
fect in size and proportion. The im-
posing white structure is flood-lighted
at night and looks like a projected
screen image against its immaterial
background.

Smoky City '

It‘s too smoky in Nashville, the in-
habitants complain. Pittsburgh‘? No
comparison. Here is the smoke par-
adise of the nation. Not only does the
soft coal burned provide soot, but the
surrounding mountains themselves
fume in their own right. For good

To Play Again
For Style Show

Returning to the scene of his first
campus triumph, Ches \Valters brings
a now well-known 10-man orchestra
to the Schenley hotel ma.in ballroom
Wednesday, April 3, to synchronize
with music the swaying movements
and subdued gestures of models in
The Pitt News spring style show.

VValters’_boys, since their ﬁrst cam-
pus appearance in The News fall
style show, have been in demand for
many University dances, including the
annual Interfraternit_v informal dance
and sing at the \Villiam Penn hotel
in November.

Ellis H. Tumpson, BA35, business
manager of The News and general
chairman of the style show, disclosed
that men and women who-will model
spring fashions as interpreted by the
buyers of outstanding Pittsburgh
stores will be announced \Vednesday.

Military Ball
History Now

Unofficial, rough, unconﬁrmed es-
timates place the attendance at Fri-

day night’s Military Ball at 1,500
couples.
It was the kind of dance at

which anyone could have remained
hidden for the evening. The four
ballrooms of VVilliam Penn hotel’s
17th floor were packed and overflow-
 shins were split and Achilles
tendons took the rap right and‘ left.

Favors for the women were em-
bossed compacts which unpreju-
diced observers admitted were the
finest at any Pitt dance in recent

years. The men received leather
cigaret cases.
Figures were unobtainable at

press time, but it is understood the
Ball did not suffer a. deﬁcit.

Pitt Amateur Photographers Sponsor
Undergraduate Print Contest, Show

 

In the hopes of encouraging ama-
tour photographers among undergrad-
uates, Pitt Amateur Photographers, a
newly formed group of camera—mind-
ed students, is sponsoring a contest
and show for prints submitted.

The main idea of the show is to
center interest of the amateurs and
give‘ them a competitive opportunity
to know the work their contemporar-
ies are tloing. The department of
journalism, Alumni Review and Owl
have offered prizes for winners in
various branches of the show.

Prominent faculty members have
agreed to act as judges for the exhibit.
The dates for. the showing are May
1 to 6. All entries must be in by
April 26. Cash prizes in excess of
$50.00: are offered,

The various branches of the con-

test inclurle, in addition to the grand

photos, architectural subjects. por-
traits of students,’ human interest sub-
jects and action pictures of athletes.

The regulations demand that the
pictures be taken since the first of the
Year; that the prints be mounted on
14 by 18-inch boards; and that the
work be entirely that of the student
entering with :he exception of ﬁlm
(l9V€‘«10Dment. A ten-cent entry fee
will be charged to form a grand prize.

Further information may be ob-
tained in Room 1412, Cathedral, or
from members of the organization.
The members are: Helen Milliron.

Best Debate of Year i

KNOXVILLE, Tenn., March 18.-
Knoxville college presented a ﬁne
case for nationalization of munitions
this morning, and no one knows bet-
ter than your correspondents. It was
a tight case, an emotion-stirring case,
a rabble-rousing case. “Best debate
of the year,” the Pitt men main-
tained.

This afternoon was taken up with
a visit to the TVA development at
Norris ‘ind the Norris dam on the
Clinch river. The conservative Knox-
ville Journal is advocating a clean-up
campaign in Knoxville, so that more
people will come away impressed after
visiting this site of experimental so-
cialism.

“Any private enterprise around
here?” the men asked the soda foun-
tain attendant in the Norris com-
munity house. “No, sir, the govern-
ment owns everything,” he answered
with a broad grin. “And I like

Most Norris residents seem to “like
it fine.” In the community center is
a surprisingly varied library, a post-

Scalps Along Way

Goldberg, Banks Capture Three
Wins, No Defeats, Varied
Views On Kingﬁsh

By Telegraph to The Pitt News

BATON ROUGE, La., ;\*Iarr:.l1 23.--;
The Merchants of Breath (Braying
Colonels) rested easily today enjoying
the sights of Baton Rouge with the
scalps of Louisiana, Tulane and
Birmingham debaters tucked securely
under their belts.

With three wins, one or two draws
and no defeats, Edwin P. Banks, C35.
and Israel L. Goldberg, C36, visited
the Louisiana. State university yester-
day with Coach Richard L. Murphy to
investigate life, liberty and Huey
Long.

Last night the trio heard M11 Long
tear into James Farley and local poli-
ticians over the air like Grant taking
Vicksburg.

Displayed on the Louisiana campus
were divers books boosting Long for
president. Ever_vbod}' commented and
bought the books, except students.

Louisiana, the Pitt men found, is
the most modernly equipped univer-
sity they have yet visited. On the_
campus is an up-to-date theater, an ex-
perimental radio station and a large
library.

Southern life, they observed, has
its difficulties. They cannot under-
stand the drawl, the race problem is
dominant, women are as lovely as ex-
pected. But the fraternities lack
clean sheets.

Vvednesday at Birmingham before
the largest audience yet encounter-
ed, Banks and Goldbergiattacked na-
tionalization of munitions. The com-
mon praotice there is to wait until
after the debate to present the affirm-
ative.

The Plttmen won.

The Birmingham campus they found
“too beautiful for words.” There was
a. nioon. Later Banksfsald, referring
to Birmingham:

Reppert Says ‘ ‘Facts’ ’ Prime Mark
Of “True Engineer”

 

The ﬁeld of public works presents
the best opportunity for the engineer
today.

So stated Charles M. Reppert, chief
engineer of the city of Pittsurgh, bo-
tore the mechanical engineers’ sem-
inar Thursday.

“By an engineer,” Mr. Reppert said,
“I do not mean an engineering spec-
ialist in one ﬁeld but a person who is
broad enough in all lines of engineer-
ing and especially good in some to-
hold responsible positions.

“Many engineers, because of their
one narrow field, have found a great;
deal of trouble adapting tl1em.selve.~;
to new positions made necessary by
business conditions.”

Mr. R:eppert listed the points which,
he believes, make the true engineer:
technical knowledge. original think-
ing, method of approach, expression.
management, and “economic consid-
oration.”

Hovey Announces 50 Extra Tickets
For Fine Arts Films——-‘H20,’ ‘Potemkin’

 

By Sydney Horovitz

In response to the excessive de-
mand for free tickets to the second
showing of artistic ﬁlms tomorrow
evening in the Falk Elementary school
auditorium, the department of fine
arts today has made available 50 extra,
seats.

Tickets for “Potemkin” and "H120"
may be obtained in the department
ofﬁce, Room 109, State hall.

For the second series of the ﬁne
arts “movie project,” \Valter R. Ho-
vey, rzcting head" of the department,
has selected an American ﬁlm, Ralph
Ste.iner’s “H20_.” and a. Russian film,
Eisenstein’s “Potemkin.”

“Pot.emkin” has been described by
Douglas Fairbanks as “the worlds
greatest motion picture.” It shows
excellently the structural Iﬁlm tech-
nique developed by earlier Russian
directors, which is exerting a tre-
mendous influence in pictures through-
out the world.

The key to this technique, accord-

ing to Philip C. Elliott assistant pro-
fessor of fine arts and "director of the
project, is called montage. This sys-
tem of editing or cutting is a com-
positional arrangoinent of material
already ﬁlmed. It produces inherently
"iilmn_ic results.”

liisonsteiu, the director, is generally
re§;'zi1'de(l as one of the. greatest mo-
tion picture directors in the world.
\Vith 400 miles 01‘ Hollywood ﬁlm, he
traveled. over Mexico, getting moving
picture scenes, the result of which was
the picture, “Thuncler over Mexico.”

“Potemkin” itself is based on the
first years of the Russian revolution.

'l.‘11e American ﬁlm, “H20,” presents
a theme built up from water in mo-
tion. The theme is worked out as a
background like a stage setting. The
aesthetic point of view is used as a
unit throughout.

The picture is short. has no plot
and is full of pure imagery. Director
Steiner is considered a master of
photography.

PREMIER Pierre-Etienne Flandin buried his head in the sand of

France’s age-old hatred for Germany \Vednesday, and dug up the
wormy statement that Germany was responsible for the \Vorld \Var
He announced that the coalition of people who fought for justice in
1918 “Was victorious, as it will be in the future.”

The justice fought for and won in 1918 has rearmed the nations
of the world for another war that probably won ’t be heralded as mak-

ing the “World safe for democracy.”

That justice has allowed

munitions makers to be the weather vanes for disarmament confer-

(‘llC€S.

That justice has precipitated the rise of more international

distrust and suspicion than poor China ever felt for growling Japan.

Flaiidin asks if we shall “resign ourselves to what would be
bankruptcy of the disarmament conference".?” He declares that since
the armistice “\Ve (France) have been obsessed with the desire to

Flandin’s statements are the most inflammatory of those made

since (3‘rermany’s announcement.

England acts through Sir John

Simon and Captain Anthony Eden, who sit at the railroad station
with their week-end bags beside them. wondering which train to take.
But what Flandin says probably typiﬁes what they think.

Now just how much diplomats a.nd the various kinds of cooing
peace doves believe of what they theniselves say, we do not know.
They evidently expect what they say to be believed by their hearers.

Some of their hearers, at least, are likely to think:

How can Germany ’s movements bankrupt a disarmament confer-
ence that has been conﬁned to the alms-house for several years

already?

Just what was the justice that was fought for in 1918?

And

what will serve for justice’s cry for the next ﬁve years?

How does French Air Minister Victor Denain’s request for more
money gibe with France ’s “obssession for disar111ament”‘?

It ’s a11 old, old story, this huff and puff that “diplo1nacy” raises
to cover up the fact that it really doesn’t know anything to do except

swiljcll its tail in the sand.

There was one honorable point in the
code of the ancient mythical dragons.

They let their victims know

that the light in their eyes was not a feeling of brotherhood, but 1111-

adulterated hate.

But Germany just sticks out her tongue at the mention of the
League of Nations, and the Treaty of Versailles, and says, ‘.‘Yah,

yah! You won't fool me again!”

That the functions of the Assembly have been limited to social

The situation inherited froln the Stu-

much of the Assembly time was dissipated unavoidably by having

‘reasonable to suppose the Assembly will have increased usefulness.
Soiiie of the false gods of American education have been tossed over-

again for other reasons than commercial ones.

They Began To Shell
The Fate Of The Kid

End Of The War

By ROMAN LAPICA

They Began to Shell
Night had come.
It was weird and mysterious there

among the scarred trees of the St.
Mihiel sector. Men coughed and
chewed tobacco nervously as they

shuffled along the road toward the
German-built dugouts quarter of a
mile back of the front lines,

No cigarets were allowed. So quiet
was the night the word was passed
for all to stop talking. Whispers,
however. passed back and forth as
the men peered into the darkness
ahead.

They were in dugouts now,

had expected to stay quite a while.

But this was September, 1918.

The men threw off their knapsacks.
Some leaned against the walls. Some
sat on the ground. Every one was si-
lent. It was their first time close to
the lines. '

Then they began to shell.

A mortar shell blasted the ground
close by. Then another and another.
The enemy had the exact location of
each dugout. The men kept going to
the door of the dugouts to look out.
They were scared.

“VVe’re getting out of here,” the
commanding officer whispered.

Packs were hastily slung on should-
ers again. The men crept out of the
dugouts and began to retreat as the
shells came closer and closer.

“That was mv first experience,”
declared Art (Red) Johnson, Uni-
versity chemical engineer. He said:

“We were about a hundred yards
away from the dugouts. The men
were marching rapidly under per-
fect discipline. Suddenly another
shell came over. We leaped for
C0"‘.‘l‘ as it landed. -

“A fragment tore the Bull
ham out of my back pocket.”

The Fate of the Kid

Johnson was assigned to the Sui-
cide Squad. This was the mortar di-
vision “hung" halfway between the
lines and the artillery. It had a good
name.

“The mortars frequently explod-
ed,” Johnson said. “Then had the
Germans come over, we could never
have gotten out in time.”

One day six of them were bringing
up ainniunition to their guns. \Yit.h-
out warning a German plane dove out
of the skies. Around St. Mihiel the
Germans had the air to themselves.
They kept it until close to the Arm-
istice.

Johnson and the ﬁve were trapped
in a ﬁeld as the plane swooped down
and cut loose its machine guns. Tl1e;.-’
broke for a communication trench at
the edge of the ﬁeld.

The plane banked and came down
again. The Kid and Johnson were
close to the trench. Just as they
leaped into it, the plane raked them
with ﬁre.

The Kid sagged to his knees. John-
son ieaped to his side.

"You all right?” he said.
The Kid took olf his helmet.
an ugly .30-.30 hole in the rim.

The Kid was the youngest volun-
teer in the outﬁt. He was an orphan
and had enlisted right after his eight-
eenth birthday. His job every day
was to bring up cigarets, candy and
mail from the post a mile back of New
Farm_ on the road to Thiacourt.

He had it timed right to make the
trip and back in between barrages.
This day, however, they began sooner
than usual and had the Kid out off
at the post.

"The Kid was talking with four am-

\Vell

bulance drivers, when a shell came
screaming. They dove on- their
faces. The shell struck the ambu-

lance right "beside them.

When the Kid came to, he was ly-
ing over the headless body of one of
the men. (‘lose by was another, near-
ly out in two.

Somehow the Kid staggered to his
feet and crept back to his company.
He fainted as he entered the farm-
house.

Johnson, who stripped the Kid to
see where he was wounded, said
there wasn't an inch of clothes with-

out a hole. The Kid himself was un-
hurt.
German Mortar

Johnson told one about the old
240's.

Back in training at Fort Dela-

bonelle, they received a new six-inch
German mortar. All the men wanted
to ﬁre it. They drew lots.

Johnson drew the 240. Another
man drew an English mortar, The
German gun went to the third man.

On the ﬁrst shot, the English gun
blew off its ﬁring pin and was ruined.
Johnson with his had no trouble at
all.

When they ﬁred the German gun, it
exploded and killed ﬁve.

End of the War

Then three days before the Arm-
istice, a direct hit landed on one of
the guns at New Farm and the men
were called out to repair the cama-
Ilouge.

They were still working when the

‘Famed ‘American Spirit’

Finds New Role In TVA

 

Norris Residents Feel No

In Their Home Town, Although US Owns It

 

By Edwin Banks

NASHVILLE, TENN.——-If there is
one spot in these United States, Year
5 of the Depression, to tingle the slug-
gish blood of a political pessimist, it
is a little community in Eastern Ten-
nessee by the name of Norris.

Here. a mile or two from that
amazingly stupendous project, Norris
dam, a group of a thousand or more
workers is constructing a government-
managed -«job, living in government-
built and owned homes, buying at
government stores and receiving light
and heat from a government electric
power plant. More wonderful than
these, the men -and their families

don’t seem to mind the situation,
don’t feel their precious personal lib-
erties crushed by the regimentation,
are not conscious of having lost that
peculiarly American faculty known as
private initiative. Apparently Roose-
velt started something when he estab-
lished the TVA.

Call the system socialism, collec-
tivism, cooperativism, or any other-
ism you care to, it certainly seems to
be functioning well. Every citizen of
Norris whom we were able to ques-
tioin was enthusiastic about his new
way of living, eager to show us the
comforts and conveniences of the
houses and deeply appreciative of the
President's program.

The reasons for such exulierance
can hardly be found in the generosity
of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
\Ve were told that the dwelling rents
are no lower than the average city
rates throughout the district, and we
learned from experience that the com-
munity store prices are the same as
those charged by private commer-
cial enterprise. Furthermore the
wages paid to the workers are similar
to those of private construction com-
panies. Electric current rates are
lower than those of private Tennessee
utilities, but. compare with those of
municipally owned plants

So it is my impression that the in-
habitants of l\’orris are not contented
because they are being pampered by
the federal government——whicl1 they
are not. Rather, they have become
imbued with the collective spirit; each
is working with each other and not
against each other. The ideal of co-
operation as opposed to the ideal of

competition has been 1'ealized—in
Norris.
Incitlentally, one feature of the

TVA human program that struck me
as interesting is the architectural va-
riety of the houses. A great hue and
cry has always been raised against
collective planning; because it is sup-
posed to result in standardization, that
haunting fear of the rugged i11dividl-
alist. But the worried have nothing
to be afraid of in this respect at
Norris. There are 50 separate types
of dwellings, which are not arranged
in monotonous rows. Those persons

“Is the city going to undertake any

the houses is graduated to $49.50

Chem Engineers Earn Right To Meet Kappa Sigma Boys

For First University

Intramural Cage Title

 

One game, the Chem Engineers-Kappa Sig championship contest,
remains to be played before Mr. Feeley and Joe Tormey, ’32, Panther

_:i-id star and co-sponsor with Feel

ey, say so long to the most success-

ful intramural athletic season in Pitt ’s history.
Tormey, who has witnessed a majority of the league court games,

has compiled an interesting set of

ﬁgures. According to his records,

34 teams have started and completed their intramural basketball

schedules.

Eleven hundred and seqrenty-two
men have played during the four
weeks of play. Three hundred and
forty-four diﬁerent players performed
for the 34 basketball ﬁves.

One hundred and thirty-one. Greeks
represented the 13 social fraternities
on the campus. Fifty dents and 51
med students played in the Dent
school and Med School leagues, re-
spectively.

The engineers with 52, independents
with an even 50 and the ROTC with
10, brought the total up to 344.

In semiuinal games on Wednesday
and Thursday nights, the Chem En-
«rineers, runner-up in the Engineer
loop, and Kappa Sigma, Greek cham-
pion, advanced to the title game of
the Intramural elimination tourney.

The Chem Engineers defeated the
Sig Soplis, Med winner, 22-17, on
Thursday at the stadium. Roszkowski
paced the winners with six ﬁe-‘id
goals. It was a closely-played con-
test, the score, at lialf-time being tied
at 10-all.

Kappa Sigma trounced the Dent
champs, 46-32, on the preceding eve-
ning. Michelosen, working the slot in
the red and white offense, was in ﬁne
form, scoring 19 points. Hensley and

Football Players Complete
One Week Of Spring Drills

 

Coach Sutherland Must Find Replacements For Nine
Positions Left Vacant By Graduating Seniors

This business of- building football temps is a plenty tougli and
trying occupation as the thinning grey hair on the heads of most

«college coaches seems to indicate.

When you have to select eleven

men to play against the nation ’s outstanding football teams, as does
Dr. Sutherland, the task becomes ever so much more difﬁcult.

Right now Dr. Sutherland is watching the candidates for varsity
positions go through their paces during the spring practice periods

with
deﬁnite idea as to the abilities of
each candidate before next fall rolls
around.

As yet, not one of the berths on
next year’s team is occup-ied, and
won’t be until the player shows

enough to give him an edge on the
other candidates.

The coaching staff is watching the
players from every angle. The backs
not only have to run with the ball,
but pivot, pass, receive passes, start
fast, block, back up the line, diag-
nose plays and be able to break up
the opposing team's passing attack.

The ends that win the positions will
have to outplay the other candidates
in taking out the defensive tackles, re-
ceiving passes and getting down un-
der punts.

Linemen will be rated on their
ability at pulling-out of the line, speed,
ability to break up plays, stop line
plays, diagnose plays, block punts and
passes and blocking.

Among the candidates are boys both
experienced and inexperienced, who
can do practically everything their
positions demand.

Bill Kern has among his seven
tackle candidates four players with
at least one year of competitive ex-
perience and three freshnien. Detzel.
Daniel], Stoughton and Scarfpin have
tasted ﬁre, while Matisi, Schmitt and

 

the hopes of having a fairly¢

Walton, Hanley, Richards and Glass-
ford are out for the guard posts. Hens-
ley, Gongloff, Kliskey and Adams are
out for the center position.

Greene, McClure and M,iclielosen are
vieing for the quarterback position.
Rector, Dwyer and Patrick are candi-
dates for the fullback position.

Eight players have visions of play-
ing at one of the halfback positions.
Who it will be from among LaRue,
Randour, Shedlosky, O’Neil, Malarkey,
Trogleone, Urban and Stapulis is a
question that will be decided during
the spring training period, and if not
then during fall practice.

Another call has been issued for
football candidates. This announce-
ment applies to any undergraduate stii-
dent who desires to try out for the
team.‘ Equipment is being issued at
the stadium equipment room.

Tartan Greekmen
Invade Pitt Court

Tech Interfraternity Champions
Meet Kappa Sigs Tomorrow

 

Carnegie Tech’s Theta Xi’s, intra-
mural basketball champs, invade the
Pitt campus tomorrow night at S
o’clo.-k, to tangle with Kappa Sigma,
the Pitt Greek champs, for the city
intramural title.

Led by Bill Spisak, speedy Tartan
backﬁeld ace, the Tech ﬁve will at-
tempt to take the city trophy, won
last year by the Pitt Delta Tau Del-
ta’s, back to the Schenley Park cam-
pus.

Pitt’s Kappa Sig winners will be
after their fourteenth straight‘ vic-
tory. The regular lineup of Michel-
osen and Beachler at the forwards,
Hensley at center and Delich and
Great -at guards, will take the floor
for the red and white.

John Green, Tartan hurdler, and
Frank Hess will hold down the guard
positions on the Theta Xi five. Larry
Jetter will team up with Spisak at
the other forward; and Bob Heppel
will jump at center to round out the
Tech team.

Theta Xi has a record of eight
straight victories t.o its credit. This
team represents the National league,
one of three Intramural leagues at
Tech. McGill Hall, American league
winner, and Delta. Tau Delta, Federal
league winner, were defeated by the
Theta Xi’s in the round-robin ﬁnals
for the Carnegie Tech title. They
have rung up 225 points as compared
to 75 for opponents in eight straight

victories. The lineup:

I give you the mildest smoke, the best-

tasting smoke. I do not irritate your throat.
You wonder what makes me different.

For one thing, it’s center leaves. I Spurn

the little, sticky, top leaves . . . so bitter to

the taste. I scorn the coarse bottom leaves,

so harsh and unappetizing. I am careful

Food Purchasers
Announce Savings

22 Fraternities See $1,800 Gain
During Five Month Period

The Fraternity Cooperative Buying
association continues to show large
savings for its members, although
considerably restrained by NRA and
its price-ﬁxing provisions.

According to Samuel Strauss, busi-
nessman-ager of the association, it
has saved more than $1,800 during a

period of less than i’ive months in pur--

chasing food supplies for its 22 mem-
bers on the campus. A '

Further gains may be realized, Mr.
Strauss believes, in view of rising
food prices and the possibility that
the price-ﬁxing provisions of the codes
will be removed.

The cooperative buying system,
which was inaugurated to secure
lower prices by group purchasing, has

handled $17,356 worth of business
since the beginning of school this
year.
