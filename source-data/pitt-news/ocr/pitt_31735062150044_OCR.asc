lPeace Looms as Committees
Submit New Nomination Plan  
To Trustees, Alumni Council

The alumni and the trustees have ﬁnally got together.

Of this we are sure.

Ofﬁcially the story is that an agreement concerning alumni election to
the board was reached by committees of the Board and the alumni, ap-
proved by Alumni council, and simply awaits ratiﬁcation at the next meet-

ingof the Board of Trustees,

That’s about as far as the official story goes.

Unofﬁcially the plan has been described as a “compromise,” that is,
according to the Pittsburgh Press, which listed alleged provisions of the
plan in a story running in its late editions on December 27, a story
subsequently run in the Post-Gazette and the Sun-Telegraph.

- , Both trustees and alumni spokesmen emphatically deny that the Press
version was official, refuse to comment on the provisions, and prefer to stick

to a statement issued by Alumni council president I-Iarbaugh Miller:

“No

‘announcement of the details of the plan will be made until the Board (of

Trustees)’ has approved it.”

The Alumni council at a special meeting called for that purpose ap-
proved and adopted the plan prepared by committees of the Board and

Alumni council for the selection of alumni members of the Board.
Board was scheduled to meet December 30, to consider the proposal, and,

The

as: informed observers believe, ratify the plan, but the meeting was ad-
journed so that members of the Board could attend funeral services of

who died December 28.~

.fellow trustee Ogden M. Edwards, former dean of the School of Medicine,

No date has been set for the next meeting of the Board.

Authoritative circles, though declining to disclose contents of the plan,
nevertheless have indicated that the solution is the ﬁrst amicable adjust-
.ment since the issue was first raised in 1936 when the Board invited the
General Alumni association to submit nominations. '

Acting secretary of the alumni association, Eugene L. Burkhart, hailed
the plan as a “solution to a troublesome problem which has impeded the

come to both parties.”

“From my viewpoint, it is an extremely fair and equitable solution, a
compromise which will begin a new era of cooperation,” he said.

" The plan was prepared by-»two special committees. The Board com-

~ mittee included G. Greer Coolidge, chairman, Hugh Thompson Kerr, John

G. Frazer, William P.__ Snyder Jr., Joseph C. Trees, and C. F. C. Arensberg

DeVitis Gives

Two Lectures

M. _A. DeVitis, associate professor
of modern languages, will give two
lectures on Pan-America this week.

Speaking oﬁ-campus tomorrow
morning before members of the
Congress of Clubs at 10 o’clock, Mr.
DeVitis will depict the cultural and

h'i'stoI'iii‘.:-iI'

American countries.

believing that there is widespread
misconception and misunderstand-
ing of fundamental ideas, as well
as a number of psychological and
technical differences, Mr. DeVitis
contends that these factors obstruct
closer relations between the United
States and- Pan—Amer‘1can countries.

Mr. DeVitis, author and editor
of several Spanish textbooks and
student of South American culture
and history for 30 years. is well
known as a lecturer and radio com--
mentator on Hispanic culture.

Discussing the “Language and
Literature of Latin America,” Mr.
DeVitis will make his second ap-
pearance of the week Thursday at
12:30 o’clock in 1228 Cathedral.

This talk, fourth feature of the
YWCA Pan—American program, is
a follow-up of earlier meetings on
traditions of Latin American peo-
ples. The public affairs committee
sponsors the meetings for all wo-
men on campus. “Bring your
lunch,” urges _Rosemary Bunting,
Ed41, chairman.

“You imagined it,” he says.

[The elevator lights, at present
being tested, will be placed into
permanent operation shortly, ac-
cording to the department of build-
ing and grounds.]

The opinionated die-hard is An-
drew Loncher, ’36, the University’s
elevator dispatcher. Mr. Loncher,
who’s really a very nice fellow, has
stop-watched the elevators on
every floor in the building, and he
maintains that, except in cases of
an unusual breakdown, the eleva-
tor service doesn’t give cause for
complaint.

“If they make any more com-
paints,” he declared, “I’ll stop-
watch ’em to death!” ‘

Aw, Mr. Loncher, not that.

Stadium Groundskeeper H as Old Wish Fulfilled
As Six Ex-Gridclers Carry His Body to Grace

They were joking up at the Sta-
dium one day not long ago; nobody
remembers much of what was said
Nobody remem-

 

bers h o w he
happened to say
it, bu.t F r a n k

M e c c a, rotund
g r o u ndskeeper,
told Luby Di-
Meolo, former
Pitt gridiron
great, “When I
die, all I want 
six of my foot-
ball boys to car-
ry me.”

Only t W 0
weeks later his
wish was fulﬁlled.

Bothered by high blood pressure
for several years, Mecca fell ill the
day after Christmas, died the fol-
lowing evening. The following
Tuesday on the last day of 1940,
he was borne to his grave by six
pallbearers, all of them his “foot-
ball boys.”

Mecca

 

From the 1940 squad were Ernie
Bonelli and Jack Benz, Nick Klis-
key and John Dickinson represent-

ed the coaches, and from the ranks
of the past stars were Dilvleolo and
Jess Quatse. It was as Mecca
would have wished.

Thus the end came for the man
who for 15 years had taken care of
the Pitt Stadium. Basketball
games, football games, track meets
———Mecca was there, jovial, voluble,
but efficient far beyond the limits
of his job. Athletes, coaches,
sportswriters, all knew him and
swore by him. It was more than a
joke when the DeSota street bowl
was nicknamed Mecca Stadium; it
was a tribute to Mec’s loyalty and
devotion.

Mecca came up the hard way—
day laborer, lamp lighter, Univer-
sity groundskeeper. Then in 1925
the Stadium was built and the
grounds crew was placed under
Mecca direction. It was the be-
ginning of a remarkable 15 years

during which Mecca philosophized,
l.ectured. on foreign affairs, com-
mented on Pitt athletics, and alter-
nately bawled out his football boys
and fed them immense quantities
of spaghetti and meat balls cooked
by his wife. He had planned such
a spaghetti dinner for the athletic
ofﬁce employees the week after
Christmas.

He never wore new hats. Occa-
sionally, he bought one, but it was
wasted money, for Pitt football
players would wear a hat for a
while, then give it to Mecca. He
far preferred MacMurdo’s hat or
Baker’s hat or any of a number of
such ancient fedoras to a brand new
felt.

Somehow he managed to give a
personality to the dull gray walls
and the fresh grass and the gigantic
girders of the Stadium. There will
be someone else in the job after a
while. But as a University official
said, “You can’t replace a man like
Mecca. You can only get another
man to handle the work.”

Sturlents Urged
To Help Rev‘ise

Rules of Group

A call to the students for sug-
gestions of a revision of the SFA
constitution was issued today by
David Tucker, C41, chairman of the
revision committee. He promised
that a “deﬁnite and speciﬁc pro-
gram of action” will be taken on
the basis of these recommendations.

T1‘-cker said that this is an op-
portunity for all students -and or-
ganizations who -feel that the pres-
ent system of student government is
faulty to express their views.

Students are asked to write these
suggestions. or recommendations in
letter form, address them to the
committee, and place them in the
SFA mailbox in the dean of men’s
office. The committee then will
read the letters and consider the
relative merits of each suggestion.

Tucker states that “no matter
how broad or how trivial the sug-
gestion the committee will read and
welcome all letters.” He asks also
that each letter be signed with the
student’s name.

The constitutional revision com-
mittee of the SFA was created last
fall by the executive committee in
the interests of  more eﬁ’cien.t sys-
tem of student-faculty government.

Members of the committee are:
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women;
Vincent W. Lanfear. dean of men;
Roy H. Umble, instructor in speech;
Rae Young, C41; Virginia l-Ialen,
C41; Harriet Harris. Ed42; and Wil-
liam McElwain, C41.

The committee has been holding
weekly meetings to consider this
problem of a possible revision of
the present constitution.

Belated Analysis
Of [<’lD'Eﬁ’s Speech

THE PRESIDENT quite logically came out
for complete non-isolation in his speech to the
nation last Sunday.

One writer has said that President Roose-
velt’s policy, if he has a policy, is one of educat-
ing the American people to collective security.

On Sunday in a speech to the majority of
the nation—the industrial workers, the city
clerks, the small business men, the farmers, and
the old peop1e—he completed his educational
program. He asked for an all out for collective
security—the collective security of the British
Empire and and the United States of America.

The gist of the President’s argument—and it
was no longer an argument to him——was: The
Nazis most certainly intend attacking America,
providing that they win the war. But they are
being held off for the moment by Britain and
the Empire. In order to protect the national
security of the U. S., it is absolutely necessary
for us to aid Britain to the fullest measure pos-
sible. If we are successful, there will be no need
for our ﬁghting the Germans.

The speech was in the nature of a pep talk.
National defense for the past few months has
bogged down in a series of squabbles. And right
now Britain needs real help to survive. The
President’s job in a situation like this is to pep
up the enthusiasm for defense and aid to
Britain.

A pep talk is not meant to be honest.
a psychological weapon.

The President in his speech Sunday was not
trying to be honest, we hope. For he carried his
points so far and no further. For instance, he
said that if Germany wanted to invade South
America they could say “We are occupying you
to protect you from aggression by the United
States.” But what he did not say was that when
We invade South America to protect ourselves
we would say “We are occupying you to pro-
tect you from aggression by Germany.” And he
chose one specific and quite detestable class of
anti-war mongers and said nothing about the
sincere anti-war minds who have quite as inter-
national a viewpoint as the President.

And he said that the “people of Europe who
are defending themselves do not ask us to do
their ﬁghting.” But he has already said that
their ﬁght and our ﬁght were inseparable; and
so he means “. . ask us to ﬁght with them.”
Any attentive reader can point out many times
when the British people have asked us to join in
their and our battle.

The President also says plainly that talk of an
eixpeditionary force is “deliberate untruth,” and
further along he says, “Our national policy . . .
isto keep war away from our country and away
fro"... our people.” But he does: not say that
under no ClI'CU.lllSia.‘(.‘.C{-BS whatever will he send
an expedi'tionary or naval military force to Eu-
rope. Yet if it becomes necessary to keep war

It is

away from America by sending an expeditionary
force it is quite logical——according to policy-to

do so.
V In London_, the United Press reported that re-
action to the speech “was to regard it as prepar-
ing the U. S. A. for entry into the war at a not
too distant date.” _
.1; If the President is an educator, he has suc-
ceeded well in educating London, but have the

people of the’ United States learned what it’s all
about?

that the presentation of My Old Kentucky

happen at the recital, but, you see we’ve just
been listening to the radio, what’s left of it,
and we don’t like the treatment Pitt’s adopted

We’d suggest the formation of a committee to

Any resemblance between the names of the persons o-r committees
herein examined and actual committees or living persons, must be purely

coincidental, fictitious, and heretical to boot.

We are authorized to reveal the
formation on campus of the No

defunct No War Message Before

rently employed rushing street cars
and waving PM chatter on the re-

Since the collapse of the

of the NFWBA6 at a meeting in the
cellar of the British Embassy, we
have noticed a ‘complete revitaliza-

Count Basie. Notice the solid riff which cruises Benny

out of this world for three marvelous choruses on the
Royal Garden side. Also Georgie Auld’s hot tenor sax

M in Wholly Cats. Henderson Stomp and Nobody fea-

tures ﬁne Cootie Williams’ trumpet on the ﬁrst side
and tasty singing on the reverse side’s class Q tune.
Benny Rides Again and The Man I Love show colored
boy Cootie off again on Benny Rides. Amazing swing to
sweet changes by composer-arranger Eddie Sauter
make this side really exciting. I-Ielen-Forrest really
does credit to The Man I Love by singing this difﬁcult
tune in an unusually sympathetic manner. Can this
record mean that even Goodman has heard cries for
more sweet stuff? Maybe so, but the King’s solid
beat is still there. Frcnesi and Hard To Get gives you
a chance to compare King Benny and runner up Artie
Shaw on the same tune. It won’t take you many
grooves to discover why they are King and runner up,
and in that order. Goodman’s Frenesi has a good kick,
smooth clarinet, and powerful tenor. All backed by
an unusual arrangement. Hard to Get, features a
smooth Goodman, but with ﬁne kicks. More singing
by Helen Forrest who sounds more like Bea Wain
than Bea Wain.

SVVEET ADD A LINE: Keep it dark. but put
order in early for a new time which I heard Benny
COOL’-man play last Saturday night. It’s called Super-
man, and, according to Benny, Columbia will release
it within the next two weeks. It really rocks.

LONGHAIR NOTES: Do me a favor and listen
(yes, really listen) to Columbia’s Album X10. It’s
Walter Geiseking with the London Philharmonic, di-
rected by Sir Henry Wood playing Cesar Franck’s Sym-
phonic Vatrmtions for Piano and Orchestra. You’ll hear
typical Cesar Franck genius for full tonal. expression.
Marvelous piano and exciting forte phrases carry
through two superb sides to a delicate climax where
M1‘. GeiSeking’s radiant piano laughs momentarily over
the orchestra before the ensemble swings on to a per-
fect fourth side. Mr. Geiseking gets ﬁrm and sympa-
thetic support from Sir Henry Wood and the orchestra.

Sidelines
With Bill McElwain
Sports T Editor

There is just no telling what this man Carlson is going to do
next. Several years ago he had an all-senior basketball team that was
expected to mop up the countryside, and instead they wobbled and
slipped and slithered through one of the Doctor’s poorer seasons.
This year the Doctor has another all-senior team, and from their
records as sophomores and juniors, no one could get too steamed up
over them. Just to be confusing, they came back from the Middle
"West last week after winning four games from major opponents,
"losing one in an overtime, and being smothered by an inferior
"Northwestern ﬁve in one of those unexplainable debacles.

Keep Your Fingers Crossed

It isn’t likely that the Panthers will run into any more serious
competition the rest of the schedule than they faced during the holi-
days. They ’ll play some pretty fair teanis—Westm1nster, Penn
State, Duke—but nothing like Butler or Illinois. It would seem then
that there is nothing to worry about, that all the boys have to do is
go through the formality of playing out their schedule. This, as
coach-medico Carlson will readily tell you, just isn’t so.

While it seems hard to believe now, this is practically the same
team that last year wavered between championship basketball and
purely low grade stuﬂ all season. No better example could be shown
than the Carnegie Tech games. In the ﬁrst the Panthers ran up
better than 70 points and took the decision by a 30 point margin, but
the Tartans won the second when Pitt’s defense collapsed and their
shooting eyes apparently went out‘ of focus.

Don’t get us wrong. We ’re not minimizing anything the Con-
tinuity Cuties have accomplished thus far, but we can ’t look back at
the record without wondering a little. Straloski, Port, Milanovich,
Klein, and Kocheran make an excellent ﬁrst team. Juniors Paifrath
and Ziolkowski and sophomore Malarkey are three better than aver-
age reserves. It looks like an unbeatable combination. We hope so,
3-but we also feel that it might be wise to reserve a few of our cheers
:for a couple of months.

Panthers Bowl Them Over

Another stack of bowl games has been here and gone, and once
again Pittsburghers have found little to interest them. But at least
two of the games aroused a partial glow of home town spirit. Pan-
ther halfback Bobby 'l‘hurboii cavorted for the North in the North-
South game at Montgomery, Alabama, and Panther fullback George
Kracum teamed up with some other pretty fair ballplayers in the
East-'\Vest game at San Francisco.

Big George had fellows like Tom Harmon, Fran Reagan, and
IFori'est Evashevski playing in the same backﬁeld with him. and while
the net results were none too satisfactory to the Easterners, from
where we sat (in Breiitwood) Kracum seemed to be doing quite
nicely, thank you. It ’s possible the radio announcer was making a
mistake, but if it wasn’t George who was shredding that VVestern
line. then it was another plenty powerful fullback. Every time he
carried, the play always ended “First and 10” or “Second and
seven.”

Brother Thurbon wasn’t a starter for the Yankees and he did no
scoring, but he stepped oﬁ a few long runs and added to the general
spectacle of the favored Rebs getting licked in their own backyard.
All in all, we question whether Carl ‘Snavely, the North ’s coach; was
displeased over having Robert the Rabbit running for him instead of

-- against him.

Panther Quintet‘ Begins Home Campaign
Against Westminster Tomorrow Evening

BY hrthur Reinstein
Successful in four out of six battles with the ﬁnest teams in
the Midwest, Pitt ’s tough and ready Panthers clash with the tall
and sometimes terriﬁc Titans of Westminster tomorrow night on

the Stadium court.

Coach Grover Washabaugh’s invaders have ﬁnished right side
up in their ﬁrst four starts this season and were favored to topple

Youngstown Saturday night. De-
spite the loss of Captain Mel Miller
and Joe Hetra from last year’s
starting ﬁve, the giant of the little
district schools seeks revenge for its
«.-7-35 defeat by last season’s Pitt
ﬁve. .

Towering Titans

Sparked by number one sharp-
shooter Lee Fox, the high-scoring

Titan quintet shows fast, hard-.

ﬁghting “Buzz” Ridl,
handler “Smokey” Dunmire, and
long-time Washabaugh proteges
Stan Wasik and Joe Spak, both
good team players. Only Fox fails
to hit the six-foot mark.

Against this impressive array of
basketball talent Doc Carlson will
throw an all-senior starting fi"e
buttressed by several capable -e-
serves. In their six games opening
drive, marked chieﬂy by roughness,
toughness, and sometimes remark-
able long range shooting, the Panth-
ers played a consistent brand of
basketball, something seldom seen
on the Stadium Pavilion in recent
years.

Pitt took an early lead in the
season’s opener with Wisconsin,
stretched it behind Eddie Stralo-
ski’s 19 points, and coasted in, al-
most sliding too far before Stro’s
deadly shooting put the brakes on
and saved a 36-34 victory.

Win in Ovcrrtime

The Panthers trailed most of the
way against Illinois in their next
start, and rallied to force a 36-all
tie, with Mel Port and big Sam
Milanovich setting the pace. Tay
Malarkey’s foul toss put Pitt ahead
in the overtime peeriod, and they
stayed ahead to cop another thriller.
43-41.

Tired by their two gruelling bat-
tles, Carlson’s men were steam-
rollered by an average Northwest-
ern team, 48-28. Beaten by Butler
University earlier in the season, the
Wildcats’ rugged boys had a good

Howard Waite, football trainer,
will take over the duties of fresh-
man basketball coach left vacant
by the drafting of Dr. Paul Zeh-
fuss into regular army duty.

Starting tomorrow and continu-
ing every Tuesday and Thursday,
Waite will conduct classes for any-
one who would rather take basket-
ball than a regular gym class.

All freshmen interested are asked
to come out for the freshman squad,
which will practice every afternoon
except Wednesday at 2:30 o’clock.

If enough men come out for this
squad, a league will be formed like
the one conducted last year.

Teams from the freshman squad
will play preliminaries at home
varsity games.

MEL PORT
old faithful

night while Pitt’s
wouldn’t roll in.

Rudely upsetting Butler’s bomb-
ers, 41-40, the Jungle Cats rolled
back into stride. Jimmy Klein hit
four times from in close to keep
Pitt in the running in the ﬁrst half,
and Klein, Port, and Milanovich
tossed in baskets in a torrid last
ﬁve minutes to pull a tough game
out of the reach of Bob Dietz and
his mates.

Larry Paffrath, number six man
on the Pitt squad, replaced Mel

shots just

vPort when the red-head fouled too

many Wolverines, and whipped six
ﬁelders and a foul goal through
the cords to pace the Panthers in a
tough loss to Michigan. Leading
until the last 10 seconds, the Panth-
ers watched Mike Sotiak pitch in
the tying goal and score twice more
in the overtime, rolling his total
up to 21 and the Michigan total to
46, six more than the Pitt score.

, _ . Every card came up right as D_oc

Carlson used 12 men to subdue
Ohio State, 48-34. Larry Paffrath
and Lefty Ziolkowski hit for 11
points each and nine other boys
broke into the scoring column.

LARRY PAFFRATH—-They call
him the “Blor-de Bombshell” but
dcn’t make a mistake. Paffrath’s
glamor is of the basketball variety.

Carlson is plenty 35

around.

Larry was the
hottest ball play-
er the Stadium
court fans had
seen in a good
many years, but

      
   

after a terriﬁc
start, he cooled
off considerably

a n d succumbed Paﬁmth

to a bad case of sophomore jitters.
The following year he dropped out
of school and spent the next season
with home town independent teams.

Back again this fall he ranked
sixth man in Carlson’s ﬂoor plans
but when Mel Port left the Michi-
gan game on fouls, Paffrath stepped
forward and took high scoring hon-
ors with 13 points. Two nights
later against Ohio State substitute
Larry tied with Ed Ziolkowski in
scoring 11 points and played a uni-
formly sparkling brand of ball.
Proﬁcient at any position, Paffrath
seems set for a big year.

LE and HIS 

VVAA Jottings

by Harriet Harris

As a 1941 opener the freshman volleyball team will play the soph-
omore volleyball team today at 4:30 o’clock. The game will be played

in the Cathedral gymnasium.

Last year, the present sophomore class won the volleyball tourna-

ment by beating out the present senior class by one point.

The game

had gone into an extra period, however, before this was accomplished.

 

Pitt Natators
Swim. in Sixth
Aquatic Forum

Concluding festivities of the Sixth
Annual Aquatic Forum at Fort Lau-
derdale, Florida, an all-Western ag-
gregation swamped an all-Eastern
outﬁt under a 130-54 score. Some
seven hundred swimmers and
coaches from ﬁfty colleges and uni-
versities around the country at-
tended the Christmas week ac-
tivities.

Although the Eastern delegates
offered no excuses for their poor
showing, it was generally conceded

among those present that the losers
made a remarkable showing in
spite of the fact that they were out-
numbered in almost all of the
events.

Michigan Dominant

Michigan once again completely
ruled the roost. Matt Mann’s
mighty mermen almost scored
enough points alone to beat the
East. The Wolverines placed ﬁrst,
second, or third in every event.

Panther men for Ben Grady
shared coaching duties of the East-
ern squad with Bob Miller of Bow-
doin. Bob McCaﬂerty and Gus
Wilde of the varsity squad along
with Ralph Wilde of the freshman
team represented the University of
Pittsburgh at the Forum.

Meanwhile, the Panther swim-
niing squad is swinging into its
final month of preparation for the
initial meet of the season with
Rider College, February 1. At this
early date, Grady cant tell much
about the squad. But he is quite

Hyde’s Script Selected
For C & G Productin

Graduate Titles
Comic Musical

‘Head over Heels’

George Hyde, ’40, has been
named author of the script for
the 1941 all-male Cap and Gown
iproduction, tentatively called
“Head over Heels.”

A comic Cap and Gown show
about a newspaperman and the
Ballet Russe de Castle Shannon,
Hyde’s book was chosen by the pro-
duction committee of the Graduate
Cap and Gown club from approxi-
mately half a dozen which were
submitted in various stages-of com-
pletion.

Hyde is well equipped to have
written the script, for he set a rec-
ord of four years’ service in the
Cap and Gown chorus while an un-
dergraduate. He was an English
major, president of Quill club, hon-
orary literary society, and vice pres-
ident of the Undergraduate Cap and
Gown club.

While in school Hyde also served
‘as copy editor of the Pitt News and
was a member of Men’s council’ and
Omicron Delta Kappa, national
leadership honor society.

This is the ﬁrst time in several
years that the script of a recent
graduate has been accepted for the
Cap and Gown show. Last year’s
production “Snap Your Fingers,”
was written by a student, Frank
Miller. -During past years, scripts
were written by students Bob Saﬁ-
ron, ’39, and Nick Spanos, ’.38, and
graduate G. Norman Reis, ’16.

At present Hyde is revising the
script and spotting songs for the
student-written music which has
already been selected for the pro-
duction by the club.

Former Dean

A Edwards flies

Dr. Ogden M. Edwards, former
dean of the School of Medicine and
a member of the Board of Trustees
since 1919, died December 28 at his
home, 5007 Fifth avenue. Before
ass1unin.g the deanship in 1918, Dr.

, Edwards was for 10 years professor

of pediatrics, and had Dr. William
 McEllroy, present dean of the
School of Medicine, as one of his
students.

Dr. Edwards became dean when
staff members were released for
medical and surgical service in
France during the First World war.
He supplied every ofﬁcer from the
School of Medicine with personal
equipment.

Born in Pittsburgh in 1869, Dr.
Edwards studied at Princeton uni-
versity, and entered practice in
1898, serving his internship at
Gouverneur hospital," New York
city. He specialized first in obstet-
rics and later pediatrics, serving at
various times on the staﬁs 0-f the
Western Pennsylvania, St. Francis,
and Children’s hospitals.

In 1919 Dr. Edwards was selected
a member ofthe University Board
of Trustees, on which he served un-
til "his death.

In recent years Dr. Edwards was
interested in business, being a part-
ner in a Pittsburgh brokerage ﬁrm
and a member of the New York
stock exchange since 1932.

Universit
Can’t Resist Call
Of School Bells

Only a few students unoiﬁcially
extended their Christmas vacation
to include Thursday and Friday, a
hasty survey revealed today. Pro-
fessors report very few cuts this
year by fellows and girls who just
couldn’t bear to come back to the
old grind on a Thursday.

No stringent regulations against
holiday cutting exists at Pitt where
the problem has never reared its
head in a big way. It just seems to
be an old custom around here to
come back to school when you’re
supposed to.

It is not so in many colleges-—
Penn State, for instance, has suf-

fered so badly from mass cutting
that the administration has clamped
on a $5 penalty for those cutting
classes 48 hours before and after a
holiday.

This year, when ﬁnes were levied
after the Thanksgiving vacation,
385 were $5 poorer at Penn State.

Pitt Biologists Use 5,000 Eggs
For Study of ﬂhick Embryos

By Sidney G-rossman

Five thousand eggs, not f or egg-
nogs or Tom and Jerries, but for
science. That’s how many Dr. Peter
Gray, associate professor of biology,
Mary L. Dodd, Bulil foundation fel-
low, and Helen Worthing, research
assistant in biology, used in their
experiments on "chick embryos.

They have proved that the direc-
tion of growth of the chick embryo,
 it lies on the egg yolk within the
shell, is affected by injections of
carbohyrates inthe form of sugars
like glucose. mannouse, and levu-
lose. They believe there is :.a prob-
ability that the direction of growth
can be affected by inhibitors (sub-
stances known to interfere with
metabolic changes), chicks, eggs,
etc., whose molecules have forma-
tions, counter or agreeing with the
direction of growth.

Results of the experiment were
presented in a paper read before
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science which met
December 31 in Philadelphia.

When a chick embryo is about 44
hours old, its forward end turns to
the right so that its head comes to

rest on the left ear. Thatis true in
94 per cent of all cases. But in 6
per cent of all normal eggs the
head turns to the left so that it rests
on the right ear. The heart follows

the direction of the heau. Experi-
ments were performed on the left-
headed‘ 6 per cent. 2 ‘

Injections of physiological" salt
solutions, -sorbitol, and galactose,
into a total of 1,150 eggs had no
effect on the number of embryos
that turned to the left. But injec-
tions of the previously named su--
gars increased the heterotaxic rate
to 12 per cent. It is known that
these sugars are used by the chick
in its development, whereas the ﬁrst
three are not.

Further experiments were done
with inhibitors that exist in right
or left-handed forms, that is, their
molecular structure has a deﬁnite
direction. Results here showed that
lef't-handed inhibitors (levo-second-
ary phthallates) stepped up the
heterotaxic rate to 12 per cent. The
right handed phthallate gave a 3 per
cent rate.

So they used
science.

Vacation Visitors to Cathedral
Appreciate Guides, Libraries

The grass always looks greener
on the other fellow’s campus.

At least, that’s the way it seemed
to an observer watching visitors
come and go from the Cathedral
during Christmas vacation. The
Pittsburghers took things pretty
much for granted. They showed a
good bit of amusement at the
structure.

But the out—of-towners were most
appreciative of all. According to
Mrs. J. K. Miller, University host-
ess, “people who had seen universi-
ties all over the country, all over
the world, in fact, were inestimably
pleased with the excellent guide
system we have here, and most of
them especially liked the nationality
rooms, as well as the libraries.”

Among the visitors were people
from Nova‘ Scotia, Norway, Canada,
Paris, Japan, and of course, from
all over the United States. The
Saturday before Christmas Mrs.
Miller’s guest book registered at
least 500 persons.

Two young refugees from Eng-
land were among those hosted at
the University. They came from a
town near the one in which Mrs.
Miller herself was reared, and they
intend to remain in this country

through the duration of the war.

A WPA Adult Education group
also was listed among the sight-
seers. “Some of them were the
most interesting people I’ve ever
met,” the University hostess com-
mented.

All in all, there were not any
more visitors than usual this holi-
day season.

Mrs. Louise Pfuetze .
regional secretary of the student
Christian movement, will speak t.o
the members of the Upperclass
Luncheon club in 833 Cathedral at
12:30 o’clock today. After her ad-
dress Mrs. Pfuetze will lead a dis-
cussion on “What should member-
ship in a Christian association mean
to us.”

Members who expect to attend
the luncheon should sign up in
either of the Y oﬁices.

By Georgia Shuset
He’s a nice sort of fellow-—tall,
thin, gray-haired.
Likeable.

And when he grins, the corners of
his eyes wrinkle up and you feel as
if the world isn’t such a bad place
after all.

He’s one of those people who
take a long time to get angry.
Maybe that’s why George W. Lang-
dale, ’22, the University’s superin-
tendent of printing, is one of the
best-liked people around campus.
He’s been here since 1917—Sep-
tember 15, to be exact. '

And talk about being versatile!

He’s done everything from mar-
keting a line of birthday and Eas-
ter cards to raising chickens.

"Now he prints all the cards that
you see on University bulletin
boards advertising the Yuletide fes-
tival, the Community fund, and
sundry other goings-on.

He’s the kind of a person who has
a master‘ of letters degree and still
gets a kick out offooling around
with the ﬂowers in the backyard.

_“I took most of my Litt M. in-
late afternoon,. Saturday morning,
and evening classes here at Pitt,”
Mr. Langdale explained. “I spent
almost all of my time,-—-with ‘the
exception of sleeping and working
hours—-—in the library.”

When he discovers a new kind of
type he sets it up in practically
every ad he- prints for weeks and
weeks. Then he tries out a new
border design, and Pitt students
>willfﬁnd themselves looking at tiny
arrows, with eccentric-looking cur-
lycues on the end, decorating each.
and every campus notice.

And the best part about it is that

the freshman debate

If the University were to announce that all stu-
dent publications cease, tlie student body would be
quick to rise and protest. Student publications here
at Pitt, just as anywhere in America, are dependent on

the students themselves. They must edit, they read
and they support.

The success of student publications, financially,
directly depends upon the students. The money paid
by the student for his copies is trifling compared to
the cost of running the individual magazine or news-

paper. The important source of revenue comes from
arlvertisiiig, national and local.

Local merchants are always willing andi ready
to advertise as long as they feel their advertisements
are being observed, and acted upon. Why notmake it
a habit of reading the advertising sections of your
publications, as well as looking into the services and
products oi’ the advertiser? if their products are satis-
i’actory, patronize thorn.

After all... these merchant-advertisers enable the
editors of your publications to give you better publi-

0 Langdale Grinds Out Noti

ces from War to War

Mr. Langdale was born in War-
ren, Pa., and graduated from the
Chautauqua Literary-Scientiﬁc cir-
cle and the University, in addition
to having taken courses at the In-
ternational Typographical union
and the United Typothetae of
America. He received honorable
mention for his work in color har-
mony, design, proportion, and dis-
play.

He’s an activities man, too.

He belongs to the Blue Lodge of
Masons and to Phi Alpha Theta,
honorary history fraternity.

“I like to do a lot of walking and
gardening,” he declared, “I used to
go in for basketball and swimming
a great deal when I was younger,
but now my hobbies consist mostly
of ceramics—casting and ﬁring
kiln, and collecting good books,
good from the printing and binding
standpoint.”

The pleasant-mannered printer
has been in all the principal cities
east of the Mississippi, and has
done extensive traveling in Eng-
land and Scotland, as well as Hol--
land and Belgium.

A staff of ﬁve office and shop»
workers assist Mr. Langdale in the
work of the University Print shop,
