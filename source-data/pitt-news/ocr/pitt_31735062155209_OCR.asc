Seeks Grant

The University and Mount Mer-
cy College are among 23 Pennsyl-
vania colleges seeking Federal
grants for new buildings.

The University has asked for
$977,880 ‘to help pay for two
academic buildings at Johns-
town’s new campus and expects
to spend about $3,500,000 on the
buildings with the federal grant
providing nearly a million.

Mount Mercy wants $652,000 to
help build a new library and
hopes to break ground next year.

sulted in the publication of

Grunddeutsch — The Basic -

(Spoken) German‘ Series by
Prentice-Hall. A list of 1,300
«words most commonly, used
was collected from 400 taped
conversations of aboirt 12 min-
utes duration each.

Dr. J . Alan Pfeffer, chairman of
the University’s Department of
Germanic Languages and Litera-
tures, did the bulk of the research
through funds provided by the
U.S. Office of Education.

The basic list contains about 85
per cent of words employed by
the interviewees in their conver-
sations. The list itself is quite
current.

Dr. Pfefier envisions that further
research will continue through
1968. The present research should
provide other source materials
for teaching German throughout
the world.

Harriers; Take

17th In NCAA

Ten inches of snow and a fro-
zen golf course in East Lansing,
Mich., provided the setting for
the NCAA cross—c0untry cham-
pionships.

The Panthers ﬁnished 17th out
of the 45 schools represented in
the meet. Dave Eichenlaub once
aagin led the Panthers, placing
20th. Frank Handleman was 82nd;
Damien Koch, 98th; Fran Shor,
103, and "Don Hinchberger ended
up 128th in a ﬁeld of some 300
runners.

The race was won by Elmer
Banton of Ohio University. West-

‘ern Michigan captured the team

title with Oregon second.
Despite the harriers’ showing,

coach Jim Banner pointed out

that the ﬁrst ﬁve ﬁnishers for

the Panthers were juniors and _ _

sophomores, perhaps forecasting
good tides for 1965.

Gridders Collect Mistakes

UNIVERSITY PARK, PA.
The football team closed its
season here Saturday with
a game that answered the
question: “If Pitt is so good,
why have they won only
three games?”

Unlike Penn State, who looked
like one of the top ten teams
in the country, the Panthers ﬁ-
nally put all their mistakes into
one game. On their ﬁrst drive, if
that’s what you want to call it,
Fred Mazurek had a receiver
open in the right ﬂank. He threw
towards his receiver, but Lion
linebacker Ed Stuckrath inter-
cepted the ball.

In another series, the Panthers

had a fourth down punting sit- .-

uation. Penn State took a time
out to get its offensive unit into
the game. The Panther coaches
decided to leave the offense in on
the punt. Then on State’s first
play from scrimmage, Tom Ur-
banik ripped through the Pan-
ther line for 31 yards.

But the Panthers weren’t ﬁn-
ished making mistakes. The ﬁrst
time’ the Panthers had the ball
in the third quarter they drove
down to the Penn State 15-yard
line. There Barry McKnight furn-
bled, State recovered, and the
Panthers were stopped again,

_ Penn State, on the other hand.

the season, according to coach
Rip Engle. Engle spoke softly
about the game, but his hazel
eyes gleamed with joy, the kind
of joy that comes with turning
an inept early season ﬂop into
.a late season sensation. “They’re
as good a team now as I have
ever coached,” Engle said. “I
don’t know if they’ll be playing
any more games this season, but
if this was their last game, they

By BARRY SHAW
"During the summer, the Pitts-
burgh Symphony went on a
world-wide tour sponsored by the
State Department. As part of the
cultural exchange program, the
Symphony reciprocally hosted Po-
_lish conductor Witold Rowicki
and Soviet cellist Daniel Sha-

 

‘fran at Syria Mosque this week-

end. The works performed were
all Eastern European and in-

.cluded Khatchaturian’s Cello

‘Concerto and Dvorak’s New
World Symphony.

Somehow, the concerto did not
succeed. It is usual to blame
either the conductor or the solo-

~i_st, but this time one is tempted

to blame the composer himself.
IKhatchaturian’s score, while it
was unusual, called for several
changes in rhythm throughout

— the piece, and what seemed to be

simply blasts of sound from the
woodwinds and strings.

got going, some change in scoring‘

to exist in separate sections,
rather than as a whole. We must
give credit to the conductor and
soloist, who, considering this, did
_an admirable job. If nothing else,
the piece demonstrated the ar-
tistry of Shafran, who was called
back for an encore.

The question of music consi-
dered as a whole, versus music
considered as separate parts,
came up again in Dvorak. This
time it was a matter of treating
each movement as .a symphony
in miniature, Or considering each
movement as it contributed to
the dramatic effect of the entire
symphony. ’

In the ﬁrst movement Rowicki
showed considerable r e s t r a in t
with the orchestra, presumably
waiting for his chance in the last
movement to ﬁnish the work in
a fury.

The second and third move-
ments fared better however. The
second movement incorporates
the Negro folksong Going Home,
and succeeded, with the use of
_the English horn, to recreate the

    

Pittsburgh symphony.  
Rowicki and Shafran

countrylike serenity always pre-
sent in the music of Dvorak. The
third movement also, sounding
like something out of Dvorak’s
Slavonic Dances, triumphed be-
cause of Rowicki’s Slavic insight
into the music.
And ﬁnally in the last move-
ment, Rowicki let loose with all
the fury he had been saving since
the beginning. Never letting up,
yet never over-doing it, the sym-
phony closed with a stirring ﬁ-
nale. A larger sense of perspec-
tive on the part of Rowicki, could
_have brought about a near per-
fect performance
